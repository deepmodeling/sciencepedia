This exercise  demonstrates the direct relationship between the potential of mean force and the underlying potential energy landscape when there are no other degrees of freedom to average over.

            "problem": "Consider a single particle moving in one spatial dimension with coordinate $x$ in a double-well potential $U(x)=\\frac{k}{4}\\left(x^{2}-x_{0}^{2}\\right)^{2}$, where $k>0$ and $x_{0}>0$ are constants. Let the reaction coordinate be the identity map $\\xi(x)=x$. Assume the system is at thermodynamic equilibrium with temperature $T$ in the canonical ensemble. Define the potential of mean force (PMF) $F(\\xi)$ along the reaction coordinate via the constrained canonical partition function, and use the Blue Moon ensemble (BME) mean-force identity to relate the derivative of $F(\\xi)$ to microscopic quantities.\n\nNow, consider the String Method for Rare Events (SMRE), which identifies a minimal free-energy path (MFEP). In one dimension, the MFEP coincides with the coordinate line itself. Parameterize the string connecting the two minima at $x=-x_{0}$ and $x=+x_{0}$ by a monotone parameter $\\alpha\\in[0,1]$ such that $x(\\alpha)=-x_{0}+2x_{0}\\alpha$. Using the PMF $F(\\xi)$ derived from first principles, express the free energy along the string, $F(\\alpha)\\equiv F\\big(\\xi(x(\\alpha))\\big)$, in closed form.

No units are required. Do not provide intermediate steps in the final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in statistical mechanics, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution.\n\nThe potential of mean force (PMF), denoted by $F(\\xi)$, along a reaction coordinate $\\xi$ for a system in the canonical ensemble at temperature $T$ is defined by the equilibrium probability density $P(\\xi)$ of finding the system at a value $\\xi$ for the reaction coordinate:\n$$F(\\xi) = -k_B T \\ln P(\\xi) + C_0$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $C_0$ is an arbitrary additive constant. The probability density $P(\\xi')$ is given by the statistical average over the canonical ensemble:\n$$P(\\xi') = \\frac{\\int \\delta(\\xi(x) - \\xi') \\exp\\left(-\\frac{U(x)}{k_B T}\\right) dV}{\\int \\exp\\left(-\\frac{U(x)}{k_B T}\\right) dV}$$\nwhere the integration is over the entire configuration space volume $V$. In this one-dimensional problem, the configuration space is simply the coordinate line $x \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$, and the volume element is $dx$. The reaction coordinate is given as the identity map, $\\xi(x) = x$. Therefore, $\\xi'$ is simply a value of the coordinate, which we can denote by $x'$. The probability density becomes:\n$$P(x') = \\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(x - x') \\exp\\left(-\\frac{U(x)}{k_B T}\\right) dx}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{U(x)}{k_B T}\\right) dx}$$\nUsing the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, $\\int f(x)\\delta(x-a)dx = f(a)$, the numerator simplifies to $\\exp(-U(x')/(k_B T))$. The denominator is the partition function $Z = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-U(x)/(k_B T)) dx$. Thus,\n$$P(x') = \\frac{1}{Z} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{U(x')}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of the PMF, let's use $x$ as the variable for the reaction coordinate value:\n$$F(x) = -k_B T \\ln\\left[\\frac{1}{Z} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{U(x)}{k_B T}\\right)\\right] + C_0$$\n$$F(x) = -k_B T \\left(-\\ln Z - \\frac{U(x)}{k_B T}\\right) + C_0$$\n$$F(x) = U(x) + k_B T \\ln Z + C_0$$\nCombining the constant terms into a single constant $C$, we find that the PMF is identical to the potential energy up to an additive constant:\n$$F(x) = U(x) + C$$\nThis result can be confirmed using the Blue Moon ensemble mean-force identity, which states that the derivative of the PMF is the constrained average of the generalized force: $\\frac{dF}{d\\xi} = \\langle -\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial n} \\rangle_{\\xi}$, where $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n}$ is the gradient in the direction of the reaction coordinate. For $\\xi(x)=x$, the direction is simply along the $x$-axis, so $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial n} = \\frac{dU}{dx}$. The constrained average $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle_{\\xi}$ is over all microscopic configurations for which $\\xi(x)$ has a fixed value. Since $\\xi(x)=x$, the constraint $x=\\text{const}$ fixes the entire configuration. The average is therefore trivial, and we have:\n$$\\frac{dF}{dx} = \\frac{dU}{dx}$$\nIntegrating this confirms that $F(x) = U(x) + C$.\n\nThe problem specifies a normalization condition for the free energy along the string, $F(\\alpha)$, parameterizing the path from $x=-x_0$ to $x=x_0$. The path is given by $x(\\alpha) = -x_0 + 2x_0\\alpha =\nx_0(2\\alpha-1)$ for $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$. The free energy along the string is $F(\\alpha) \\equiv F(x(\\alpha))$. The condition is $F(0)=0$, where $F(0)$ corresponds to $F(\\alpha=0)$.\nAt $\\alpha=0$, the position is $x(0) = -x_0$. The condition is $F(x(-x_0))=0$. Using our expression for $F(x)$:\n$$F(x(-x_0)) = U(-x_0) + C = 0$$\nThe potential is $U(x) = \\frac{k}{4}(x^2 - x_0^2)^2$. At $x=-x_0$:\n$$U(-x_0) = \\frac{k}{4}((-x_0)^2 - x_0^2)^2 = \\frac{k}{4}(x_0^2 - x_0^2)^2 = 0$$\nTherefore, $0 + C = 0$, which implies the constant $C=0$. With this choice of reference, the PMF is exactly equal to the potential energy:\n$$F(x) = U(x)$$\nNow we can find the closed-form expression for $F(\\alpha)$:\n$$F(\\alpha) = F(x(\\alpha)) = U(x(\\alpha)) = \\frac{k}{4}\\left([x(\\alpha)]^2 - x_0^2\\right)^2$$\nSubstitute $x(\\alpha) = x_0(2\\alpha-1)$:\n$$F(\\alpha) = \\frac{k}{4}\\left([x_0(2\\alpha-1)]^2 - x_0^2\\right)^2 = \\frac{k}{4}\\left(x_0^2(2\\alpha-1)^2 - x_0^2\\right)^2$$\nFactor out $x_0^2$ from the inner parenthesis:\n$$F(\\alpha) = \\frac{k}{4}\\left(x_0^2[(2\\alpha-1)^2 - 1]\\right)^2 = \\frac{k x_0^4}{4}\\left[(2\\alpha-1)^2 - 1\\right]^2$$\nExpand the term $(2\\alpha-1)^2 = 4\\alpha^2 - 4\\alpha + 1$:\n$$F(\\alpha) = \\frac{k x_0^4}{4}\\left[(4\\alpha^2 - 4\\alpha + 1) - 1\\right]^2 = \\frac{k x_0^4}{4}\\left[4\\alpha^2 - 4\\alpha\\right]^2$$\nFactor out $4\\alpha$ from the inner bracket:\n$$F(\\alpha) = \\frac{k x_0^4}{4}\\left[4\\alpha(\\alpha - 1)\\right]^2 = \\frac{k x_0^4}{4} \\cdot 16\\alpha^2(\\alpha - 1)^2$$\n$$F(\\alpha) = 4 k x_0^4 \\alpha^2 (\\alpha - 1)^2$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression.\n\nFinally, we compare the barrier height of the PMF to that of the potential $U(x)$. The saddle point of the potential $U(x)$ is at $x=0$. The minima are at $x=\\pm x_0$, where $U(\\pm x_0)=0$. The barrier height in the potential is:\n$$\\Delta U = U(0) - U(-x_0) = \\frac{k}{4}(0^2-x_0^2)^2 - 0 = \\frac{k x_0^4}{4}$$\nThe PMF along the string is $F(\\alpha)$. The minima are at $\\alpha=0$ and $\\alpha=1$ (corresponding to $x=-x_0$ and $x=x_0$), where $F(0)=F(1)=0$. The saddle point at $x=0$ corresponds to $\\alpha=1/2$. The barrier height along the PMF path is:\n$$\\Delta F = F(1/2) - F(0) = 4 k x_0^4 (1/2)^2(1/2 - 1)^2 - 0 = 4 k x_0^4 \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = k x_0^4 \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{k x_0^4}{4}$$\nThus, $\\Delta F = \\Delta U$. The barrier heights coincide. This is a direct consequence of the fact that for a one-dimensional system with the spatial coordinate as the reaction coordinate, there are no other degrees of freedom to average over. The PMF is therefore equivalent to the potential energy (up to a constant), and their topographical features, including barrier heights, are identical. In higher-dimensional systems, the PMF includes entropic contributions from averaging over the orthogonal degrees of freedom, and the PMF barrier height generally does not coincide with the potential energy barrier height.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a clear set of definitions and asks for a specific derivation and conceptual analysis within the established framework of computational statistical mechanics, specifically concerning rare event sampling methods. All necessary information is provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nWe begin by following the definitions provided in the problem statement. The system is described by $n$ Cartesian coordinates, denoted by the vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The reaction coordinate, $\\xi(x)$, is given as a linear function of these coordinates:\n$$\n\\xi(x) = a^{\\top} x = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i x_i\n$$\nwhere $a = (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n)^{\\top}$ is a vector of constant coefficients.\n\nThe first step is to compute the gradient of the reaction coordinate, $\\nabla \\xi(x)$, in Cartesian coordinates.

Therefore, the gradient vector is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\xi(x) = (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n)^{\\top} = a\n$$\nAn important observation is that since the vector $a$ is constant, the gradient $\\nabla \\xi$ is also a constant vector, independent of the configuration $x$.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the Jacobian factor, which is the mass-metric norm of this gradient, $|\\nabla \\xi|_{M}$. The definition of the norm $|u|_{M}$ for a vector $u$ is given as:\n$$\n|u|_{M} = \\sqrt{\\langle u, u \\rangle_{M}}\n$$\nwhere the mass-metric inner product is $\\langle u, v \\rangle_{M} = u^{\\top} M^{-1} v$. Substituting $u = \\nabla \\xi = a$, we get:\n$$\n|\\nabla \\xi|_{M} = \\sqrt{a^{\\top} M^{-1} a}\n$$\nThe mass matrix $M$ is given as a diagonal matrix with positive entries $m_i$:\n$$\nM = \\mathrm{diag}(m_1, m_2, \\dots, m_n) = \\begin{pmatrix} m_1 & 0 & \\dots & 0 \\\\ 0 & m_2 & \\dots & 0 \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\dots & m_n \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe inverse of a diagonal matrix is a diagonal matrix whose entries are the reciprocals of the original entries.

By the problem statement, the vector $a$ is constant, meaning its components $a_i$ are constants. The masses $m_i$ are also physical constants of the system. The expression does not contain the variable $x$ or any of its components $x_i$. Therefore, the value of $|\\nabla \\xi|_{M}$ is a constant.\nThis means that for a linear reaction coordinate, the Jacobian factor $|\\nabla \\xi|_{M}$ does not depend on the configuration $x$. It has the same constant value for all points on the constrained hypersurface $\\{\\xi(x)=\\xi_0\\}$ in the Blue Moon Ensemble. Similarly, it is constant along the entire path of a string parametrized by $\\xi$ in the String Method, provided that the reaction coordinate is linear as defined. The constancy of this factor simplifies the calculation of thermodynamic properties, such as the potential of mean force, from constrained simulations.",

The Blue Moon Jacobian Factor**\n\nThe Blue Moon methodology introduces a correction factor to account for the geometric effect of constraining a system to a lower-dimensional manifold. This factor arises from the change of measure when moving from the full configuration space to the constrained surface.\n\nThe volume element in the full configuration space is $d\\mathcal{V} = dx\\,dy$. We transform coordinates from $(x,y)$ to $(\\xi, s_{\\parallel})$, where $\\xi$ is the reaction coordinate and $s_{\\parallel}$ is the arclength along the constraint manifold $\\xi(q)=\\text{constant}$. The volume element can be written as $d\\mathcal{V} = ds_{\\perp} ds_{\\parallel}$, where $ds_{\\perp}$ is the infinitesimal distance between two adjacent constraint surfaces, $\\xi$ and $\\xi+d\\xi$. This distance must be measured orthogonally to the surface in the sense of the mass-induced metric.\n\nThe direction normal to the surface $\\xi(q)=\\text{constant}$ in the mass-weighted metric is given by $n_{M} = M^{-1}\\nabla\\xi$.\nHere, $\\nabla\\xi = \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial\\xi/\\partial x \\\\ \\partial\\xi/\\partial y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe inverse mass matrix is $M^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/m_x  0 \\\\ 0  1/m_y \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSo, $n_M = \\begin{pmatrix} a/m_x \\\\ b/m_y \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nAn infinitesimal displacement $dq$ along this normal direction can be written as $dq = \\lambda n_M$ for some scalar $\\lambda$. The corresponding change in $\\xi$ is $d\\xi = (\\nabla\\xi)^{\\top} dq = (\\nabla\\xi)^{\\top}(\\lambda n_M) = \\lambda (\\nabla\\xi)^{\\top} M^{-1} \\nabla\\xi$.\nThe squared magnitude of the mass-weighted normal vector is $(\\nabla\\xi)^{\\top} M^{-1} \\nabla\\xi$.

Using the standard result for a Gaussian integral, $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-p u^2 - q u}du = \\sqrt{\\pi/p} e^{q^2/(4p)}$, and including the constant term $e^{-C_t}$:\n$$I(\\xi) = \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}{|b|} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{A_t}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{B_t^2}{4A_t} - C_t\\right)$$\nThe term in the exponent is:\n$$\\frac{B_t^2}{4A_t} - C_t = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{b^2}(bc-ak_y)\\xi\\right)^2}{4\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{2b^2}(b^2k_x + a^2k_y - 2abc)\\right)} - \\frac{\\beta k_y\\xi^2}{2b^2}$$\n$$ = \\frac{\\beta \\xi^2}{2b^2} \\left( \\frac{(bc-ak_y)^2}{b^2k_x + a^2k_y - 2abc} - k_y \\right)$$\n$$ = \\frac{\\beta \\xi^2}{2b^2(b^2k_x + a^2k_y - 2abc)} \\left[ (b^2c^2 - 2abck_y + a^2k_y^2) - k_y(b^2k_x + a^2k_y - 2abc) \\right]$$\nThe term in the square brackets simplifies to $b^2c^2 - b^2k_xk_y = -b^2(k_xk_y - c^2)$.\nThus, the exponent is:\n$$ \\frac{\\beta \\xi^2}{2b^2(b^2k_x + a^2k_y - 2abc)} [-b^2(k_xk_y - c^2)] = -\\frac{\\beta \\xi^2(k_xk_y - c^2)}{2(b^2k_x + a^2k_y - 2abc)} $$\nSo, $I(\\xi)$ has the form $I(\\xi) = C' \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta(k_xk_y-c^2)}{2(b^2k_x+a^2k_y-2abc)}\\xi^2\\right)$, where $C'$ is a constant independent of $\\xi$.\n\n**4.
