            "solution": "We are asked to find a leading-order uniformly valid composite approximation for the solution $y(x)$ to the singularly perturbed boundary value problem:\n$$\n\\varepsilon\\,y''(x)+y'(x)=1, \\quad x \\in (0,1)\n$$\nwith boundary conditions $y(0)=0$ and $y(1)=0$, where $0 < \\varepsilon \\ll 1$.\n\n**Step 1: Outer Solution**\n\nThe outer solution, denoted by $y_{out}(x)$, is valid in the region away from any boundary layers. It is found by seeking an asymptotic expansion of the form $y(x) \\sim y_{out}^{(0)}(x) + \\varepsilon y_{out}^{(1)}(x) + \\dots$.\nBy setting $\\varepsilon=0$ in the original differential equation, we obtain the reduced equation for the leading-order outer solution $y_{out}^{(0)}(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d y_{out}^{(0)}}{dx} = 1\n$$\nIntegrating this first-order equation yields:\n$$\ny_{out}^{(0)}(x) = x + C_0\n$$\nwhere $C_0$ is a constant of integration. Since the order of the equation has been reduced from two to one, this solution can only satisfy one of the two boundary conditions. To determine which one, we analyze the structure of the general solution of the original equation's homogeneous part, $\\varepsilon y'' + y' = 0$. The characteristic equation is $\\varepsilon r^2 + r = 0$, with roots $r_1=0$ and $r_2 = -1/\\varepsilon$. The general homogeneous solution is $c_1 + c_2 \\exp(-x/\\varepsilon)$. The term $\\exp(-x/\\varepsilon)$ decays rapidly as $x$ increases away from $x=0$, but changes very quickly near $x=0$. This indicates the presence of a boundary layer at $x=0$. Therefore, the outer solution is not expected to be valid at $x=0$, and it should satisfy the boundary condition at $x=1$.\nImposing the boundary condition $y(1)=0$ on the outer solution:\n$$\ny_{out}^{(0)}(1) = 1 + C_0 = 0 \\implies C_0 = -1\n$$\nThus, the leading-order outer solution is:\n$$\ny_{out}^{(0)}(x) = x - 1\n$$\nWe note that this solution fails to satisfy the boundary condition at $x=0$, as $y_{out}^{(0)}(0) = -1 \\neq 0$. This inconsistency confirms the necessity of an inner solution to correct the approximation within the boundary layer at $x=0$.\n\n**Step 2: Inner Solution and Scaling**\n\nTo resolve the discrepancy at $x=0$, we introduce a stretched inner coordinate $X$ to magnify the region around the boundary layer. Let $X = x/\\delta(\\varepsilon)$, where $\\delta(\\varepsilon)$ is the width of the boundary layer and $\\delta(\\varepsilon) \\to 0$ as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$. Let the inner solution be $Y(X) = y(x)$. The derivatives with respect to $x$ transform as:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} = \\frac{dX}{dx}\\frac{d}{dX} = \\frac{1}{\\delta} \\frac{d}{dX}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\delta} \\frac{d}{dX}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\delta^2} \\frac{d^2}{dX^2}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the original ODE gives the equation in the inner variable $X$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\delta^2} \\frac{d^2Y}{dX^2} + \\frac{1}{\\delta} \\frac{dY}{dX} = 1\n$$\nTo determine the scaling $\\delta(\\varepsilon)$, we use a dominant-balance argument. We balance the two highest derivative terms, which are the terms multiplied by $\\varepsilon$. This captures the singular nature of the problem.\n$$\n\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\delta^2} \\sim \\frac{1}{\\delta} \\implies \\delta(\\varepsilon) = \\varepsilon\n$$\nWith this scaling, the inner variable is $X = x/\\varepsilon$. The ODE for the inner solution $Y(X)$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\varepsilon^2} \\frac{d^2Y}{dX^2} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} \\frac{dY}{dX} = 1 \\implies \\frac{d^2Y}{dX^2} + \\frac{dY}{dX} = \\varepsilon\n$$\nWe seek an inner solution of the form $Y(X) \\sim Y^{(0)}(X) + \\varepsilon Y^{(1)}(X) + \\dots$. The leading-order inner problem is obtained by setting $\\varepsilon=0$ on the right-hand side:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 Y^{(0)}}{dX^2} + \\frac{d Y^{(0)}}{dX} = 0\n$$\nThe inner solution must satisfy the boundary condition at the layer location, so $y(0)=0$ implies $Y(0)=0$, which at leading order is $Y^{(0)}(0)=0$.\n\n**Step 3: Solving the Inner Problem and Matching**\n\nWe solve the linear, second-order ODE for $Y^{(0)}(X)$. The general solution is:\n$$\nY^{(0)}(X) = A \\exp(-X) + B\n$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants. Applying the boundary condition $Y^{(0)}(0)=0$:\n$$\nY^{(0)}(0) = A \\exp(0) + B = A+B=0 \\implies B=-A\n$$\nSo, the leading-order inner solution takes the form:\n$$\nY^{(0)}(X) = A(\\exp(-X) - 1)\n$$\nThe constant $A$ is determined by asymptotically matching the inner solution to the outer solution using Van Dyke's matching principle: the inner limit of the outer solution must equal the outer limit of the inner solution.\n$$\n\\lim_{x \\to 0} y_{out}^{(0)}(x) = \\lim_{X \\to \\infty} Y^{(0)}(X)\n$$\nThe left-hand side is:\n$$\n\\lim_{x \\to 0} (x - 1) = -1\n$$\nThe right-hand side is:\n$$\n\\lim_{X \\to \\infty} A(\\exp(-X) - 1) = A(0 - 1) = -A\n$$\nEquating the two limits gives $-A = -1$, so $A=1$.\nSubstituting $A=1$ back into the expression for $Y^{(0)}(X)$, the leading-order inner solution is:\n$$\nY^{(0)}(X) = \\exp(-X) - 1\n$$\nIn terms of the original variable $x$, this is $y_{in}^{(0)}(x) = \\exp(-x/\\varepsilon) - 1$.\n\n**Step 4: Composite Approximation**\n\nA uniformly valid approximation, $y_{comp}(x)$, is constructed by adding the outer and inner solutions and subtracting their common part to avoid double counting. The common part is the value obtained from the matching procedure.\n$$\ny_{comp}^{(0)}(x) = y_{out}^{(0)}(x) + y_{in}^{(0)}(x) - y_{match}(x)\n$$\nThe common part, $y_{match}(x)$, is the constant value from the matching limit, which is $-1$.\n$$\ny_{comp}^{(0)}(x) = (x - 1) + (\\exp(-x/\\varepsilon) - 1) - (-1)\n$$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$\ny_{comp}^{(0)}(x) = x - 1 + \\exp(-x/\\varepsilon) - 1 + 1 = x + \\exp(-x/\\varepsilon) - 1\n$$\nThis is the leading-order uniformly valid composite approximation to the solution.\nLet's verify the boundary conditions for this approximation:\nAt $x=0$: $y_{comp}^{(0)}(0) = 0 + \\exp(0) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0$. (Correct)\nAt $x=1$: $y_{comp}^{(0)}(1) = 1 + \\exp(-1/\\varepsilon) - 1 = \\exp(-1/\\varepsilon)$. Since $\\varepsilon \\ll 1$, $\\exp(-1/\\varepsilon)$ is an exponentially small term, so $y_{comp}^{(0)}(1) \\approx 0$. The approximation satisfies the boundary condition at $x=1$ to an order that is transcendentally small in $\\varepsilon$.\n\nThe final expression for the leading-order composite approximation is $x + \\exp(-x/\\varepsilon) - 1$.",

For uniqueness, we may also impose the condition $\\int_0^1 \\chi(y)dy = 0$.\n\n**Order $\\varepsilon^{0}$:**\nThe terms of order $\\varepsilon^{0}$ give the equation that determines $u_0(x)$:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(a(y)\\left(\\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial y}\\right)\\right) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(a(y)\\left(\\frac{\\partial u_0}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial y}\\right)\\right) = f(x)\n$$\nTo eliminate the dependence on $y$ and obtain an equation for $u_0(x)$ alone, we average this equation over one period of the fast variable, $Y=[0,1]$. Let $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle = \\int_0^1 \\cdot dy$.\n$$\n-\\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(a(y)\\left(\\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial y}\\right)\\right) \\right\\rangle - \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(a(y)\\left(\\frac{du_0}{dx} + \\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial y}\\right)\\right) \\right\\rangle = \\langle f(x) \\rangle\n$$\nThe first term is the integral of a derivative over a period. Since all functions are assumed $1$-periodic in $y$, this term is zero:\n$$\n\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\dots) dy = [ \\dots ]_{y=0}^{y=1} = 0\n$$\nThe averaging operator $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$ commutes with the derivative $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$. Since $f(x)$ is independent of $y$, $\\langle f(x) \\rangle = f(x)$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n- \\frac{d}{dx} \\left\\langle a(y)\\left(\\frac{du_0}{dx} + \\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial y}\\right) \\right\\rangle = f(x)\n$$\nSubstituting $u_1(x,y) = \\chi(y)\\frac{du_0}{dx}(x)$, we have $\\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial y} = \\frac{d\\chi}{dy}(y) \\frac{du_0}{dx}(x)$.\n$$\n- \\frac{d}{dx} \\left\\langle a(y)\\left(\\frac{du_0}{dx} + \\frac{d\\chi}{dy}\\frac{du_0}{dx}\\right) \\right\\rangle = f(x)\n$$\nFactoring out $\\frac{du_0}{dx}(x)$, which is independent of $y$:\n$$\n- \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\left\\langle a(y)\\left(1 + \\frac{d\\chi}{dy}\\right) \\right\\rangle \\frac{du_0}{dx}(x) \\right) = f(x)\n$$\nThis is the **homogenized (or effective) equation** for $u_0(x)$. It has the same form as the original equation, but with an effective (constant) coefficient $a_{\\mathrm{hom}}$ given by:\n$$\na_{\\mathrm{hom}} = \\left\\langle a(y)\\left(1 + \\frac{d\\chi}{dy}\\right) \\right\\rangle = \\int_0^1 a(y)\\left(1 + \\frac{d\\chi}{dy}(y)\\right) dy\n$$\nThe boundary conditions for the homogenized problem are inherited from the original problem: $u_0(0)=0$ and $u_0(\\ell)=0$.\n\nTo find an explicit expression for $a_{\\mathrm{hom}}$ in terms of $a(y)$, we return to the cell problem:\n$$\n-\\frac{d}{dy}\\left(a(y)\\left(1 + \\frac{d\\chi}{dy}\\right)\\right) = 0\n$$\nIntegrating with respect to $y$ gives $a(y)\\left(1 + \\frac{d\\chi}{dy}\\right) = C$, where $C$ is a constant of integration.\nNotice that the expression for the effective coefficient is the average of this very quantity: $a_{\\mathrm{hom}} = \\langle C \\rangle = C$.\nSo, the constant of integration is precisely the homogenized coefficient:\n$$\na(y)\\left(1 + \\frac{d\\chi}{dy}\\right) = a_{\\mathrm{hom}}\n$$\nWe can solve for $\\frac{d\\chi}{dy}$:\n$$\n1 + \\frac{d\\chi}{dy} = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{hom}}}{a(y)} \\implies \\frac{d\\chi}{dy} = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{hom}}}{a(y)} - 1\n$$\nNow we use the periodicity of $\\chi(y)$. The integral of its derivative over one period must be zero:\n$$\n\\int_0^1 \\frac{d\\chi}{dy} dy = \\chi(1) - \\chi(0) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\frac{d\\chi}{dy}$:\n$$\n\\int_0^1 \\left(\\frac{a_{\\mathrm{hom}}}{a(y)} - 1\\right) dy = 0\n$$\n$$\na_{\\mathrm{hom}} \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{a(y)} dy - \\int_0^1 1 dy = 0\n$$\n$$\na_{\\mathrm{hom}} \\int_0^1 \\frac{dy}{a(y)} - 1 = 0\n$$\nSolving for $a_{\\mathrm{hom}}$ gives the explicit formula:\n$$\na_{\\mathrm{hom}} = \\frac{1}{\\int_0^1 \\frac{dy}{a(y)}}\n$$\nThis shows that the effective coefficient is the harmonic average of the oscillating coefficient $a(y)$ over one period.",
