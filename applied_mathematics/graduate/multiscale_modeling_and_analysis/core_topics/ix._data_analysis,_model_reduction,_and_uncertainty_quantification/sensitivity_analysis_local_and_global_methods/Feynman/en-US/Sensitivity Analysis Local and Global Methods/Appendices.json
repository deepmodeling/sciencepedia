This exercise provides a concrete example of this limitation, asking you to analyze a simple nonlinear model where an input has zero correlation with the output but a significant variance-based influence .

            "problem": "Consider a simple multiscale output constructed from a coarse-scale input and a microscale fluctuation. Let the coarse-scale input be the scalar random variable $X \\sim \\text{Uniform}(-1,1)$, and let the microscale fluctuation be the independent random variable $Z \\sim \\text{Uniform}\\!\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{15}}, \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{15}}\\right)$.

            "solution": "The user-provided problem has been validated and is determined to be self-contained, consistent, and scientifically sound. The analysis proceeds as follows.\n\nThe model is given by the equation $Y = X^{2} + Z$, where $X$ and $Z$ are independent random variables with specified uniform distributions. We are tasked with analyzing the sensitivity of the output $Y$ to the input $X$ using two different measures: the Pearson correlation coefficient $\\rho_{X,Y}$ and the first-order Sobol sensitivity index $S_X$.\n\nFirst, we compute the Pearson correlation coefficient, defined as $\\rho_{X,Y} = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(X)\\operatorname{Var}(Y)}}$. A zero correlation coefficient implies $\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = 0$. The covariance is given by $\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = \\mathbb{E}[XY] - \\mathbb{E}[X]\\mathbb{E}[Y]$.\n\nLet's evaluate the necessary expected values. The random variable $X$ is distributed as $X \\sim \\text{Uniform}(-1,1)$. Its probability density function (pdf) is $f_X(x) = \\frac{1}{2}$ for $x \\in [-1, 1]$ and $0$ otherwise. The expected value of $X$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\int_{-1}^{1} x f_X(x) \\, dx = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{x}{2} \\, dx = \\left[ \\frac{x^2}{4} \\right]_{-1}^{1} = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} = 0\n$$\nSince the distribution is symmetric about $0$, $\\mathbb{E}[X] = 0$. This simplifies the covariance expression to $\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = \\mathbb{E}[XY]$. We compute $\\mathbb{E}[XY]$ by substituting the model for $Y$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[XY] = \\mathbb{E}[X(X^2 + Z)] = \\mathbb{E}[X^3 + XZ]\n$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, this becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[XY] = \\mathbb{E}[X^3] + \\mathbb{E}[XZ]\n$$\nSince $X$ and $Z$ are independent, $\\mathbb{E}[XZ] = \\mathbb{E}[X]\\mathbb{E}[Z]$. We already know $\\mathbb{E}[X]=0$, so $\\mathbb{E}[XZ] = 0 \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[Z] = 0$.\nNext, we compute $\\mathbb{E}[X^3]$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X^3] = \\int_{-1}^{1} x^3 f_X(x) \\, dx = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{x^3}{2} \\, dx = \\left[ \\frac{x^4}{8} \\right]_{-1}^{1} = \\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{1}{8} = 0\n$$\nThe integral is $0$ because the integrand $x^3$ is an odd function integrated over an interval symmetric about the origin.\nTherefore, $\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = \\mathbb{E}[XY] = 0+0 = 0$. Since the covariance is zero, the Pearson correlation coefficient $\\rho_{X,Y} = 0$, assuming the variances are non-zero. The model demonstrates that $X$ and $Y$ are uncorrelated in a linear sense.\n\nNext, we compute the first-order Sobol sensitivity index for $X$, defined as $S_X = \\frac{\\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X])}{\\operatorname{Var}(Y)}$. This requires computing the numerator (the \"main effect\" variance) and the denominator (the total variance).\n\nThe numerator is the variance of the conditional expectation of $Y$ given $X$. We first find the conditional expectation $\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X]$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X] = \\mathbb{E}[X^2 + Z \\mid X]\n$$\nUsing the linearity of conditional expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X] = \\mathbb{E}[X^2 \\mid X] + \\mathbb{E}[Z \\mid X]\n$$\nGiven $X$, $X^2$ is a known quantity, so $\\mathbb{E}[X^2 \\mid X] = X^2$. Since $X$ and $Z$ are independent, $\\mathbb{E}[Z \\mid X] = \\mathbb{E}[Z]$. The variable $Z \\sim \\text{Uniform}(-\\sqrt{2/15}, \\sqrt{2/15})$ has a distribution symmetric about $0$, so its expectation is $\\mathbb{E}[Z] = 0$.\nThus, the conditional expectation is $\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X] = X^2 + 0 = X^2$.\n\nNow we find the variance of this quantity, $\\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X]) = \\operatorname{Var}(X^2)$.\nThe variance of a random variable $W$ is $\\operatorname{Var}(W) = \\mathbb{E}[W^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[W])^2$. Here, $W=X^2$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(X^2) = \\mathbb{E}[(X^2)^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[X^2])^2 = \\mathbb{E}[X^4] - (\\mathbb{E}[X^2])^2\n$$\nWe need the second and fourth moments of $X$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X^2] = \\int_{-1}^{1} x^2 \\frac{1}{2} \\, dx = \\left[ \\frac{x^3}{6} \\right]_{-1}^{1} = \\frac{1}{6} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{6}\\right) = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X^4] = \\int_{-1}^{1} x^4 \\frac{1}{2} \\, dx = \\left[ \\frac{x^5}{10} \\right]_{-1}^{1} = \\frac{1}{10} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{10}\\right) = \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{1}{5}\n$$\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X]) = \\operatorname{Var}(X^2) = \\frac{1}{5} - \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{9 - 5}{45} = \\frac{4}{45}\n$$\nThis is the numerator for $S_X$.\n\nThe denominator is the total variance, $\\operatorname{Var}(Y)$.\n$Y = X^2 + Z$. Since $X$ and $Z$ are independent, the random variables $X^2$ and $Z$ are also independent. For independent variables, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(Y) = \\operatorname{Var}(X^2 + Z) = \\operatorname{Var}(X^2) + \\operatorname{Var}(Z)\n$$\nWe have already calculated $\\operatorname{Var}(X^2) = \\frac{4}{45}$. We now need $\\operatorname{Var}(Z)$.\nFor a random variable $W \\sim \\text{Uniform}(a,b)$, the variance is $\\operatorname{Var}(W) = \\frac{(b-a)^2}{12}$.\nFor $Z$, we have $a = -\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{15}}$ and $b = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{15}}$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(Z) = \\frac{\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{15}} - \\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{15}}\\right)\\right)^2}{12} = \\frac{\\left(2\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{15}}\\right)^2}{12} = \\frac{4 \\cdot \\frac{2}{15}}{12} = \\frac{\\frac{8}{15}}{12} = \\frac{8}{15 \\cdot 12} = \\frac{8}{180} = \\frac{2}{45}\n$$\nNow we can compute the total variance:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(Y) = \\operatorname{Var}(X^2) + \\operatorname{Var}(Z) = \\frac{4}{45} + \\frac{2}{45} = \\frac{6}{45} = \\frac{2}{15}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the Sobol index $S_X$:\n$$\nS_X = \\frac{\\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X])}{\\operatorname{Var}(Y)} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{45}}{\\frac{2}{15}} = \\frac{4}{45} \\cdot \\frac{15}{2} = \\frac{4 \\cdot 15}{45 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{60}{90} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nThe analysis shows that while $X$ and $Y$ are linearly uncorrelated ($\\rho_{X,Y}=0$), the input $X$ is responsible for a significant portion of the output variance, as captured by the Sobol index $S_X = \\frac{2}{3}$. This highlights the limitation of correlation-based methods for sensitivity analysis in nonlinear models and the strength of variance-based methods like Sobol indices.",

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of sensitivity analysis, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its formulation. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe analysis is structured in three parts as requested: quantification of local sensitivity, derivation of the first-order Sobol index, and an explanation for the discrepancy between these two measures.\n\nThe model is given by $f(x,y) = y + c\\,x^{2}$, with independent inputs $x \\sim \\mathrm{Uniform}(-1,1)$ and $y \\sim \\mathrm{Uniform}(0,1)$, and a constant $c>0$.\n\n**Part 1: Local Sensitivity Analysis**\n\nLocal sensitivity is assessed by the partial derivative of the function with respect to the input variable of interest. The local sensitivity of $f$ with respect to $x$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(y + c\\,x^{2}) = 2cx\n$$\nWe are asked to evaluate this sensitivity at the mean input point $(\\mathbb{E}[x],\\mathbb{E}[y])$.

This implies that for infinitesimally small variations of $x$ around its mean value of $0$, there is no first-order change in the model output $f$. The function's response surface is locally flat with respect to $x$ at this central point.\n\n**Part 2: Global Sensitivity Analysis (First-Order Sobol Index)**\n\nThe first-order Sobol index for an input $x_i$, denoted $S_i$, quantifies the fraction of the total output variance that can be attributed to the main effect of $x_i$. It is defined as:\n$$\nS_x = \\frac{\\mathbb{V}_x(\\mathbb{E}_y[f(x,y)])}{\\mathbb{V}(f(x,y))}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbb{V}$ denotes variance and $\\mathbb{E}$ denotes expectation. The numerator is the variance of the conditional expectation of $f$ given $x$, and the denominator is the total variance of $f$.\n\nFirst, we compute the conditional expectation $\\mathbb{E}_y[f(x,y)]$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_y[f(x,y)] = \\mathbb{E}_y[y + c\\,x^{2}]\n$$\nSince $x$ is held constant in this expectation and $y$ and $x$ are independent, this becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_y[y + c\\,x^{2}] = \\mathbb{E}[y] + c\\,x^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} + c\\,x^{2}\n$$\nNext, we compute the variance of this term, which is the numerator of the Sobol index, $\\mathbb{V}_x = \\mathbb{V}_x(\\mathbb{E}_y[f(x,y)])$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{V}_x\\left(\\frac{1}{2} + c\\,x^{2}\\right) = \\mathbb{V}_x(c\\,x^{2}) = c^2 \\mathbb{V}(x^2)\n$$\nTo find $\\mathbb{V}(x^2)$, we need the second and fourth moments of $x \\sim \\mathrm{Uniform}(-1,1)$. The probability density function is $p(x)=\\frac{1}{2}$ for $x \\in [-1,1]$. For an even integer $k$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[x^k] = \\int_{-1}^{1} x^k p(x) dx = \\int_{-1}^{1} x^k \\frac{1}{2} dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{x^{k+1}}{k+1} \\right]_{-1}^{1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{k+1} - \\frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k+1} \\right) = \\frac{1}{k+1}\n$$\nSo, $\\mathbb{E}[x^2] = \\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\mathbb{E}[x^4] = \\frac{1}{5}$. The variance of $x^2$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{V}(x^2) = \\mathbb{E}[(x^2)^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[x^2])^2 = \\mathbb{E}[x^4] - (\\mathbb{E}[x^2])^2 = \\frac{1}{5} - \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{9-5}{45} = \\frac{4}{45}\n$$\nThe numerator of the Sobol index is thus:\n$$\n\\mathbb{V}_x = c^2 \\mathbb{V}(x^2) = \\frac{4c^2}{45}\n$$\nNow, we compute the total variance $\\mathbb{V}(f)$, which is the denominator. Since $x$ and $y$ are independent, the terms $y$ and $c\\,x^2$ are independent random variables. Therefore, the variance of their sum is the sum of their variances:\n$$\n\\mathbb{V}(f) = \\mathbb{V}(y + c\\,x^2) = \\mathbb{V}(y) + \\mathbb{V}(c\\,x^2) = \\mathbb{V}(y) + c^2 \\mathbb{V}(x^2)\n$$\nThe variance of $y \\sim \\mathrm{Uniform}(0,1)$ is $\\mathbb{V}(y) = \\frac{(1-0)^2}{12} = \\frac{1}{12}$.\nSo, the total variance is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{V}(f) = \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{4c^2}{45}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the first-order Sobol index for $x$:\n$$\nS_x = \\frac{\\mathbb{V}_x}{\\mathbb{V}(f)} = \\frac{\\frac{4c^2}{45}}{\\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{4c^2}{45}}\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the least common multiple of $45$ and $12$, which is $180$:\n$$\nS_x = \\frac{180 \\cdot \\frac{4c^2}{45}}{180 \\cdot \\frac{1}{12} + 180 \\cdot \\frac{4c^2}{45}} = \\frac{4 \\cdot 4c^2}{15 + 4 \\cdot 4c^2} = \\frac{16c^2}{15 + 16c^2}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Explanation of Discrepancy**\n\nThe discrepancy between the local sensitivity of $0$ and the non-zero global sensitivity index $S_x = \\frac{16c^2}{15 + 16c^2}$ is a fundamental illustration of the limitations of local, derivative-based methods for functions with significant curvature.\n\nThe local sensitivity, $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2cx$, is a point measure based on a linear approximation of the function. At $x=0$, the function $f(x,y)$ has a vertex with respect to $x$, and its tangent is horizontal. The zero derivative correctly indicates that the function is momentarily insensitive to perturbations in $x$ at this specific point.\n\nIn contrast, the Sobol index $S_x$ is a global, variance-based measure. It averages the influence of $x$ over its entire domain of variation, $[-1,1]$. The term $c\\,x^2$ is nonlinear. While its slope is zero at $x=0$, it varies significantly as $x$ moves toward the boundaries of its domain, $-1$ and $1$. This variation across the input space contributes to the overall variance of the output $f$. The Sobol index correctly captures this contribution, which is encapsulated in the term $\\mathbb{V}_x(\\mathbb{E}_y[f]) = \\frac{4c^2}{45}$. Thus, even though $x$ has no first-order effect at its mean, its quadratic effect creates substantial output variance globally, making it an important parameter according to this global metric. The magnitude of this importance grows with $c$, as seen in the expression for $S_x$. As $c \\to \\infty$, $S_x \\to 1$, meaning $x$ explains almost all of the output variance.",

The variance of this conditional expectation, using orthonormality in the single variable $\\xi_{i}$, is\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}\\!\\left(\\mathbb{E}[\\,J(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})\\mid \\xi_{i}\\,]\\right) \\;=\\; \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^{(i,n)}}^{2}.\n$$\nTherefore, the first-order Sobol index can be computed analytically from the PCE coefficients as\n$$\nS_{i} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\sum_{n\\ge 1} c_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^{(i,n)}}^{2}}{\\sum_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\neq \\boldsymbol{0}} c_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}^{2}}.\n$$\nEquivalently, the numerator is the sum of squares of coefficients of all basis functions that depend only on $\\xi_{i}$ and on no other inputs, and the denominator is the sum of squares of all non-constant coefficients.\n\nWe now apply these formulas to the given truncated PCE in $d=3$:\n$$\nJ(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}) \\;=\\; c_{\\boldsymbol{0}} \n\\;+\\; 2\\,\\phi_{1}(\\xi_{1}) \\;+\\; 1\\,\\phi_{1}(\\xi_{2}) \\;+\\; 0.5\\,\\phi_{1}(\\xi_{3})\n\\;+\\; 0.8\\,\\phi_{2}(\\xi_{1}) \\;+\\; 0.4\\,\\phi_{2}(\\xi_{2})\n\\;+\\; 1.2\\,\\phi_{1}(\\xi_{1})\\phi_{1}(\\xi_{2})\n\\;-\\; 0.6\\,\\phi_{1}(\\xi_{1})\\phi_{1}(\\xi_{3})\n\\;+\\; 0.3\\,\\phi_{1}(\\xi_{2})\\phi_{1}(\\xi_{3}).\n$$\nIdentify the coefficients $c_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$ for each non-constant basis function:\n- Terms depending only on $\\xi_{1}$: $2\\,\\phi_{1}(\\xi_{1})$ and $0.8\\,\\phi_{2}(\\xi_{1})$, so $c_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^{(1,1)}}=2$ and $c_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^{(1,2)}}=0.8$.\n- Terms depending only on $\\xi_{2}$: $1\\,\\phi_{1}(\\xi_{2})$ and $0.4\\,\\phi_{2}(\\xi_{2})$, with coefficients $1$ and $0.4$.\n- Terms depending only on $\\xi_{3}$: $0.5\\,\\phi_{1}(\\xi_{3})$, with coefficient $0.5$.\n- Mixed terms: $1.2\\,\\phi_{1}(\\xi_{1})\\phi_{1}(\\xi_{2})$, $-0.6\\,\\phi_{1}(\\xi_{1})\\phi_{1}(\\xi_{3})$, and $0.3\\,\\phi_{1}(\\xi_{2})\\phi_{1}(\\xi_{3})$, with coefficients $1.2$, $-0.6$, and $0.3$, respectively.\n\nCompute the total variance:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(J) \\;=\\; \\sum_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\neq \\boldsymbol{0}} c_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}^{2}\n\\;=\\; (2)^{2} + (1)^{2} + (0.5)^{2} + (0.8)^{2} + (0.4)^{2} + (1.2)^{2} + (-0.6)^{2} + (0.3)^{2}.\n$$\nEvaluate term by term:\n$$\n(2)^{2}=4,\\quad (1)^{2}=1,\\quad (0.5)^{2}=0.25,\\quad (0.8)^{2}=0.64,\\quad (0.4)^{2}=0.16,\n$$\n$$\n(1.2)^{2}=1.44,\\quad (-0.6)^{2}=0.36,\\quad (0.3)^{2}=0.09.\n$$\nSumming,\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(J) \\;=\\; 4 + 1 + 0.25 + 0.64 + 0.16 + 1.44 + 0.36 + 0.09 \\;=\\; 7.94.\n$$\nThe numerator for $S_{1}$ is the sum of squares of coefficients of the terms depending only on $\\xi_{1}$:\n$$\n\\sum_{n\\ge 1} c_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^{(1,n)}}^{2} \\;=\\; (2)^{2} + (0.8)^{2} \\;=\\; 4 + 0.64 \\;=\\; 4.64.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nS_{1} \\;=\\; \\frac{4.64}{7.94} \\;=\\; \\frac{232}{397} \\;\\approx\\; 0.5843828715\\ldots\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures and expressing as a decimal (not a percentage) gives\n$$\nS_{1} \\;\\approx\\; 0.5844.\n$$",
