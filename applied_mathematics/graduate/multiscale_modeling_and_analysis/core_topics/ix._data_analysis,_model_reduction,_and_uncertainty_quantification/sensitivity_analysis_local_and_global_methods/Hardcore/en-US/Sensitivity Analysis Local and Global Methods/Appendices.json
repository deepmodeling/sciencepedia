The model, $f(x_{1},x_{2})=a\\,x_{1}+b\\,x_{2}$, is a simple linear model, which serves as a canonical example for illustrating the principles of GSA.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. The model function is clearly defined, and the statistical properties of the inputs (independent and uniformly distributed) are fully specified. This setup guarantees that a unique and meaningful solution for the Sobol indices exists. We assume that not both $a$ and $b$ are zero, as this would lead to a constant output with zero variance, making sensitivity analysis trivial and ill-defined.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and unambiguous mathematical language.\n- **Conclusion**: The problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. For instance, it is not scientifically unsound, incomplete, or ill-posed. It represents a valid and substantive task in the specified field.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation\nLet $Y = f(x_{1},x_{2}) = a\\,x_{1}+b\\,x_{2}$. The inputs $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are independent random variables distributed uniformly on $[0,1]$, i.e., $x_{i} \\sim U(0,1)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the moments of the input variables. For $x_{i} \\sim U(0,1)$:\nThe mean (expected value) is:\n$$ E[x_{i}] = \\int_{0}^{1} u \\, du = \\left[ \\frac{u^{2}}{2} \\right]_{0}^{1} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe second moment is:\n$$ E[x_{i}^{2}] = \\int_{0}^{1} u^{2} \\, du = \\left[ \\frac{u^{3}}{3} \\right]_{0}^{1} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nThe variance is:\n$$ V(x_{i}) = E[x_{i}^{2}] - (E[x_{i}])^{2} = \\frac{1}{3} - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{12} $$\n\nThe first-order Sobol index, $S_{i}$, for an input $x_{i}$ is defined as the fraction of the total variance of the output $Y$ that is attributable to the main effect of $x_{i}$. This is given by:\n$$ S_{i} = \\frac{V_{i}}{V(Y)} $$\nwhere $V(Y)$ is the total variance of the output, and $V_{i}$ is the variance of the conditional expectation of the output, with the expectation taken over all variables except $x_{i}$. This is expressed using the law of total variance as:\n$$ V_{i} = V_{x_{i}}(E_{\\mathbf{x}_{\\sim i}}[Y | x_{i}]) $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{x}_{\\sim i}$ denotes the set of all input variables except $x_{i}$.\n\nWe begin by calculating the total variance of the output, $V(Y)$.\nThe mean of the output $Y$ is:\n$$ E[Y] = E[a\\,x_{1} + b\\,x_{2}] = a\\,E[x_{1}] + b\\,E[x_{2}] = a\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + b\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{a+b}{2} $$\nSince $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are independent, the variance of their linear combination is:\n$$ V(Y) = V(a\\,x_{1} + b\\,x_{2}) = V(a\\,x_{1}) + V(b\\,x_{2}) = a^{2}V(x_{1}) + b^{2}V(x_{2}) $$\nSubstituting the variance of $x_{i}$:\n$$ V(Y) = a^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\right) + b^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\right) = \\frac{a^{2} + b^{2}}{12} $$\n\nNext, we derive the first-order index for $x_{1}$, $S_{1}$. We need to compute $V_{1} = V_{x_{1}}(E_{x_{2}}[Y | x_{1}])$.\nFirst, we find the conditional expectation $E_{x_{2}}[Y | x_{1}]$. We treat $x_{1}$ as a fixed constant for this expectation:\n$$ E_{x_{2}}[Y | x_{1}] = E_{x_{2}}[a\\,x_{1} + b\\,x_{2} | x_{1}] = E_{x_{2}}[a\\,x_{1} | x_{1}] + E_{x_{2}}[b\\,x_{2} | x_{1}] $$\nSince $a\\,x_{1}$ is a constant with respect to the expectation over $x_{2}$, and because $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are independent, this simplifies to:\n$$ E_{x_{2}}[Y | x_{1}] = a\\,x_{1} + b\\,E[x_{2}] = a\\,x_{1} + b\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = a\\,x_{1} + \\frac{b}{2} $$\nNow, we compute the variance of this expression with respect to $x_{1}$:\n$$ V_{1} = V_{x_{1}}\\left(a\\,x_{1} + \\frac{b}{2}\\right) $$\nSince $\\frac{b}{2}$ is a constant, it does not contribute to the variance:\n$$ V_{1} = V_{x_{1}}(a\\,x_{1}) = a^{2}V_{x_{1}}(x_{1}) = a^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\right) = \\frac{a^{2}}{12} $$\nFinally, the first-order Sobol index for $x_{1}$ is:\n$$ S_{1} = \\frac{V_{1}}{V(Y)} = \\frac{a^{2}/12}{(a^{2} + b^{2})/12} = \\frac{a^{2}}{a^{2} + b^{2}} $$\n\nBy symmetry, we can derive the first-order index for $x_{2}$, $S_{2}$. We compute $V_{2} = V_{x_{2}}(E_{x_{1}}[Y | x_{2}])$.\nFirst, the conditional expectation:\n$$ E_{x_{1}}[Y | x_{2}] = E_{x_{1}}[a\\,x_{1} + b\\,x_{2} | x_{2}] = a\\,E[x_{1}] + b\\,x_{2} = a\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + b\\,x_{2} = \\frac{a}{2} + b\\,x_{2} $$\nNext, the variance of this expression with respect to $x_{2}$:\n$$ V_{2} = V_{x_{2}}\\left(\\frac{a}{2} + b\\,x_{2}\\right) = V_{x_{2}}(b\\,x_{2}) = b^{2}V_{x_{2}}(x_{2}) = b^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\right) = \\frac{b^{2}}{12} $$\nThe first-order Sobol index for $x_{2}$ is:\n$$ S_{2} = \\frac{V_{2}}{V(Y)} = \\frac{b^{2}/12}{(a^{2} + b^{2})/12} = \\frac{b^{2}}{a^{2} + b^{2}} $$\n\n### Interpretation\nThe first-order indices are $S_{1} = \\frac{a^{2}}{a^{2} + b^{2}}$ and $S_{2} = \\frac{b^{2}}{a^{2} + b^{2}}$. These indices represent the proportion of the output variance $V(Y)$ that can be attributed to the variability of each input, $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$, respectively. The magnitude of each index is proportional to the square of its corresponding coefficient in the linear model, indicating that inputs with larger weights contribute more to the output uncertainty.\n\nA crucial observation is the sum of the first-order indices:\n$$ S_{1} + S_{2} = \\frac{a^{2}}{a^{2} + b^{2}} + \\frac{b^{2}}{a^{2} + b^{2}} = \\frac{a^{2} + b^{2}}{a^{2} + b^{2}} = 1 $$\nThe general ANOVA decomposition of variance states that the total variance is the sum of all main effects and interaction effects: $\\sum_i S_i + \\sum_{ij} S_{ij} + \\dots = 1$. The fact that $S_{1} + S_{2} = 1$ implies that all higher-order interaction indices (in this case, only $S_{12}$) are zero. This confirms that the model $f(x_1, x_2) = a\\,x_1 + b\\,x_2$ is purely additive. There is no synergistic or antagonistic interaction between the inputs $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$; their contributions to the output variance are independent and simply sum up. This is a characteristic feature of linear models without interaction terms (e.g., terms like $c\\,x_{1}x_{2}$).",

            "solution": "The user-provided problem has been validated and is determined to be self-contained, consistent, and scientifically sound. The analysis proceeds as follows.\n\nThe model is given by the equation $Y = X^{2} + Z$, where $X$ and $Z$ are independent random variables with specified uniform distributions. We are tasked with analyzing the sensitivity of the output $Y$ to the input $X$ using two different measures: the Pearson correlation coefficient $\\rho_{X,Y}$ and the first-order Sobol sensitivity index $S_X$.\n\nFirst, we compute the Pearson correlation coefficient, defined as $\\rho_{X,Y} = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(X)\\operatorname{Var}(Y)}}$. A zero correlation coefficient implies $\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = 0$. The covariance is given by $\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = \\mathbb{E}[XY] - \\mathbb{E}[X]\\mathbb{E}[Y]$.\n\nLet's evaluate the necessary expected values. The random variable $X$ is distributed as $X \\sim \\text{Uniform}(-1,1)$. Its probability density function (pdf) is $f_X(x) = \\frac{1}{2}$ for $x \\in [-1, 1]$ and $0$ otherwise. The expected value of $X$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\int_{-1}^{1} x f_X(x) \\, dx = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{x}{2} \\, dx = \\left[ \\frac{x^2}{4} \\right]_{-1}^{1} = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} = 0\n$$\nSince the distribution is symmetric about $0$, $\\mathbb{E}[X] = 0$. This simplifies the covariance expression to $\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = \\mathbb{E}[XY]$. We compute $\\mathbb{E}[XY]$ by substituting the model for $Y$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[XY] = \\mathbb{E}[X(X^2 + Z)] = \\mathbb{E}[X^3 + XZ]\n$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, this becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[XY] = \\mathbb{E}[X^3] + \\mathbb{E}[XZ]\n$$\nSince $X$ and $Z$ are independent, $\\mathbb{E}[XZ] = \\mathbb{E}[X]\\mathbb{E}[Z]$. We already know $\\mathbb{E}[X]=0$, so $\\mathbb{E}[XZ] = 0 \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[Z] = 0$.\nNext, we compute $\\mathbb{E}[X^3]$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X^3] = \\int_{-1}^{1} x^3 f_X(x) \\, dx = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{x^3}{2} \\, dx = \\left[ \\frac{x^4}{8} \\right]_{-1}^{1} = \\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{1}{8} = 0\n$$\nThe integral is $0$ because the integrand $x^3$ is an odd function integrated over an interval symmetric about the origin.\nTherefore, $\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = \\mathbb{E}[XY] = 0+0 = 0$. Since the covariance is zero, the Pearson correlation coefficient $\\rho_{X,Y} = 0$, assuming the variances are non-zero. The model demonstrates that $X$ and $Y$ are uncorrelated in a linear sense.\n\nNext, we compute the first-order Sobol sensitivity index for $X$, defined as $S_X = \\frac{\\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X])}{\\operatorname{Var}(Y)}$. This requires computing the numerator (the \"main effect\" variance) and the denominator (the total variance).\n\nThe numerator is the variance of the conditional expectation of $Y$ given $X$.

The variable $Z \\sim \\text{Uniform}(-\\sqrt{2/15}, \\sqrt{2/15})$ has a distribution symmetric about $0$, so its expectation is $\\mathbb{E}[Z] = 0$.\nThus, the conditional expectation is $\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X] = X^2 + 0 = X^2$.\n\nNow we find the variance of this quantity, $\\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X]) = \\operatorname{Var}(X^2)$.\nThe variance of a random variable $W$ is $\\operatorname{Var}(W) = \\mathbb{E}[W^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[W])^2$.

The function's response surface is locally flat with respect to $x$ at this central point.\n\n**Part 2: Global Sensitivity Analysis (First-Order Sobol Index)**\n\nThe first-order Sobol index for an input $x_i$, denoted $S_i$, quantifies the fraction of the total output variance that can be attributed to the main effect of $x_i$. It is defined as:\n$$\nS_x = \\frac{\\mathbb{V}_x(\\mathbb{E}_y[f(x,y)])}{\\mathbb{V}(f(x,y))}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbb{V}$ denotes variance and $\\mathbb{E}$ denotes expectation. The numerator is the variance of the conditional expectation of $f$ given $x$, and the denominator is the total variance of $f$.\n\nFirst, we compute the conditional expectation $\\mathbb{E}_y[f(x,y)]$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_y[f(x,y)] = \\mathbb{E}_y[y + c\\,x^{2}]\n$$\nSince $x$ is held constant in this expectation and $y$ and $x$ are independent, this becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_y[y + c\\,x^{2}] = \\mathbb{E}[y] + c\\,x^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} + c\\,x^{2}\n$$\nNext, we compute the variance of this term, which is the numerator of the Sobol index, $\\mathbb{V}_x = \\mathbb{V}_x(\\mathbb{E}_y[f(x,y)])$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{V}_x\\left(\\frac{1}{2} + c\\,x^{2}\\right) = \\mathbb{V}_x(c\\,x^{2}) = c^2 \\mathbb{V}(x^2)\n$$\nTo find $\\mathbb{V}(x^2)$, we need the second and fourth moments of $x \\sim \\mathrm{Uniform}(-1,1)$.

Therefore, the variance of their sum is the sum of their variances:\n$$\n\\mathbb{V}(f) = \\mathbb{V}(y + c\\,x^2) = \\mathbb{V}(y) + \\mathbb{V}(c\\,x^2) = \\mathbb{V}(y) + c^2 \\mathbb{V}(x^2)\n$$\nThe variance of $y \\sim \\mathrm{Uniform}(0,1)$ is $\\mathbb{V}(y) = \\frac{(1-0)^2}{12} = \\frac{1}{12}$.\nSo, the total variance is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{V}(f) = \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{4c^2}{45}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the first-order Sobol index for $x$:\n$$\nS_x = \\frac{\\mathbb{V}_x}{\\mathbb{V}(f)} = \\frac{\\frac{4c^2}{45}}{\\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{4c^2}{45}}\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the least common multiple of $45$ and $12$, which is $180$:\n$$\nS_x = \\frac{180 \\cdot \\frac{4c^2}{45}}{180 \\cdot \\frac{1}{12} + 180 \\cdot \\frac{4c^2}{45}} = \\frac{4 \\cdot 4c^2}{15 + 4 \\cdot 4c^2} = \\frac{16c^2}{15 + 16c^2}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Explanation of Discrepancy**\n\nThe discrepancy between the local sensitivity of $0$ and the non-zero global sensitivity index $S_x = \\frac{16c^2}{15 + 16c^2}$ is a fundamental illustration of the limitations of local, derivative-based methods for functions with significant curvature.\n\nThe local sensitivity, $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2cx$, is a point measure based on a linear approximation of the function. At $x=0$, the function $f(x,y)$ has a vertex with respect to $x$, and its tangent is horizontal. The zero derivative correctly indicates that the function is momentarily insensitive to perturbations in $x$ at this specific point.\n\nIn contrast, the Sobol index $S_x$ is a global, variance-based measure. It averages the influence of $x$ over its entire domain of variation, $[-1,1]$. The term $c\\,x^2$ is nonlinear. While its slope is zero at $x=0$, it varies significantly as $x$ moves toward the boundaries of its domain, $-1$ and $1$. This variation across the input space contributes to the overall variance of the output $f$. The Sobol index correctly captures this contribution, which is encapsulated in the term $\\mathbb{V}_x(\\mathbb{E}_y[f]) = \\frac{4c^2}{45}$. Thus, even though $x$ has no first-order effect at its mean, its quadratic effect creates substantial output variance globally, making it an important parameter according to this global metric. The magnitude of this importance grows with $c$, as seen in the expression for $S_x$. As $c \\to \\infty$, $S_x \\to 1$, meaning $x$ explains almost all of the output variance.",
