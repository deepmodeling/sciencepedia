Iterative Boltzmann Inversion (IBI) is a standard and widely used structure-based coarse-graining technique. The concepts of the radial distribution function ($g(r)$), pairwise potential ($u(r)$), ideal gas, and the canonical ensemble are fundamental to the field.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear initial condition ($u_{0}(r)=0$), a specific algorithm to apply (one step of IBI), and a well-defined target (a closed-form expression for $u_{1}(r)$). This structure leads to a unique and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and standard scientific terminology. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed invalidity flaws. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, and pertains directly to the specified topic of structure-based coarse-graining.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to find the effective pair potential $u_{1}(r)$ after one iteration of the Iterative Boltzmann Inversion (IBI) method, starting from an initial guess $u_{0}(r)=0$.\n\nThe IBI method is an iterative procedure designed to refine a pair potential $u(r)$ to reproduce a known target radial distribution function, $g_{\\mathrm{target}}(r)$. The core of the method is the update rule, which corrects the potential at iteration $i$ based on the discrepancy between the RDF produced by it, $g_{i}(r)$, and the target RDF, $g_{\\mathrm{target}}(r)$. The standard IBI update equation is:\n$$u_{i+1}(r) = u_{i}(r) + k_{B} T \\ln\\left( \\frac{g_{i}(r)}{g_{\\mathrm{target}}(r)} \\right)$$\nwhere $u_{i+1}(r)$ is the refined potential for the next iteration, $u_{i}(r)$ is the current potential, $g_{i}(r)$ is the RDF obtained from a simulation using $u_{i}(r)$, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. This update is derived from an approximation relating the potential of mean force to the pair potential.\n\nWe are asked to perform the first step of this iteration, which corresponds to setting $i=0$. The update equation becomes:\n$$u_{1}(r) = u_{0}(r) + k_{B} T \\ln\\left( \\frac{g_{0}(r)}{g_{\\mathrm{target}}(r)} \\right)$$\n\nThe problem provides the initial guess for the potential:\n$$u_{0}(r) = 0$$\n\nNext, we must determine $g_{0}(r)$, the radial distribution function for a system governed by the potential $u_{0}(r)=0$. A system of particles with zero interaction potential is, by definition, an ideal gas. In an ideal gas, the particles do not interact, and thus their positions are completely uncorrelated.\n\nThe radial distribution function $g(r)$ is defined such that $\\rho g(r)$ gives the average local number density of particles at a distance $r$ from an arbitrarily chosen central particle, where $\\rho$ is the bulk number density. For an ideal gas, the presence of a particle at the origin does not influence the probability of finding another particle at any other position. Therefore, the local density at any distance $r$ from the central particle is simply the bulk density $\\rho$.\n$$\\rho g_{0}(r) = \\rho$$\nThis implies that for an ideal gas, the radial distribution function is unity for all separations $r$:\n$$g_{0}(r) = 1$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $u_{0}(r)$ and $g_{0}(r)$ into the IBI update equation for $u_{1}(r)$:\n$$u_{1}(r) = 0 + k_{B} T \\ln\\left( \\frac{1}{g_{\\mathrm{target}}(r)} \\right)$$\n\nUsing the properties of the logarithm, $\\ln(1/x) = \\ln(1) - \\ln(x) = -\\ln(x)$, we simplify the expression:\n$$u_{1}(r) = k_{B} T \\left( \\ln(1) - \\ln(g_{\\mathrm{target}}(r)) \\right)$$\n$$u_{1}(r) = k_{B} T \\left( 0 - \\ln(g_{\\mathrm{target}}(r)) \\right)$$\n$$u_{1}(r) = -k_{B} T \\ln(g_{\\mathrm{target}}(r))$$\n\nThis result is the potential of mean force, $W(r)$, corresponding to the target RDF, as $W(r) = -k_{B}T \\ln(g(r))$. The first step of IBI, starting from a zero potential, is thus equivalent to approximating the effective pair potential by the potential of mean force of the target system. The problem statement specifies that $g_{\\mathrm{target}}(r)  0$, which ensures that the logarithm is well-defined and the resulting potential $u_1(r)$ is finite. At very small separations where particles cannot overlap, $g_{\\mathrm{target}}(r) \\to 0$, and the derived potential $u_1(r) \\to \\infty$, correctly representing a strong steric repulsion.",

            "problem": "You are coarse-graining a single-component fluid to reproduce a prescribed radial distribution function (RDF). In a pairwise coarse-grained model, the RDF $g(r)$ is related to the potential of mean force (PMF) $W(r)$ by the equilibrium Boltzmann relation $g(r) = \\exp\\!\\big(-\\beta W(r)\\big)$ up to an additive constant in $W(r)$, where $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse thermal energy, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. In structure-based coarse-graining via Iterative Boltzmann Inversion (IBI), the goal is to update a trial pair potential $V_n(r)$ so that the simulated RDF $g_n(r)$ matches a target $g_{\\text{target}}(r)$ obtained from a higher-resolution reference. The abbreviation IBI stands for Iterative Boltzmann Inversion.\n\nAssume reduced Lennard-Jones units, where distances are measured in multiples of a characteristic length and energies are measured in multiples of a characteristic energy, with thermal energy $k_B T = 2.5$. You are given discretized data on a uniform grid of bin centers $r \\in \\{0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00\\}$:\n- The current pair potential $V_n(r)$ at these bins is $\\{10.0, 2.5, -0.3, 0.1, 0.2\\}$.\n- The current simulated RDF $g_n(r)$ is $\\{0.00, 0.40, 1.30, 1.10, 0.80\\}$.\n- The target RDF $g_{\\text{target}}(r)$ is $\\{0.02, 0.50, 1.20, 0.95, 0.85\\}$.\n\nStarting from the fundamental relation between $g(r)$ and the PMF $W(r)$, and the modeling assumption that a pairwise coarse-grained potential $V(r)$ should track the PMF to achieve the target structure, derive an iterative update for $V_{n+1}(r)$ expressed in terms of $V_n(r)$, $g_n(r)$, $g_{\\text{target}}(r)$, and $k_B T$.

Do not include any units in the final boxed answer.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. All necessary data for the required calculation are provided. The concepts invoked, such as the radial distribution function $g(r)$, potential of mean force $W(r)$, Boltzmann inversion, and the iterative scheme, are standard and well-established in the field of statistical mechanics and molecular simulation. The numerical values are physically plausible for a system described in reduced units. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution is constructed below.\n\nThe core of structure-based coarse-graining is to find an effective pair potential $V(r)$ that reproduces a target radial distribution function $g_{\\text{target}}(r)$. The fundamental statistical mechanical relationship between the RDF $g(r)$ and the potential of mean force (PMF) $W(r)$ is given by:\n$$g(r) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{W(r)}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The PMF can thus be obtained from the RDF by inverting this relation:\n$$W(r) = -k_B T \\ln(g(r))$$\nThis expression is determined up to an arbitrary additive constant, which we can set to zero without loss of generality as it only shifts the potential energy baseline.\n\nThe fundamental assumption of methods like Iterative Boltzmann Inversion (IBI) is that the effective pair potential $V(r)$ should approximate the PMF, $V(r) \\approx W(r)$. This is motivated by Henderson's uniqueness theorem, which, under certain conditions, guarantees that for a given $g(r)$, the pair potential $V(r)$ that generates it is unique. However, the PMF $W(r)$ implicitly contains many-body correlation effects, whereas the coarse-grained simulation is typically performed with a purely pairwise potential $V(r)$. Thus, a direct inversion $V(r) = -k_B T \\ln(g_{\\text{target}}(r))$ usually fails to reproduce $g_{\\text{target}}(r)$ because the resulting PMF from the simulation with this $V(r)$ will not be equal to $V(r)$.\n\nIBI addresses this iteratively. At iteration $n$, we have a trial potential $V_n(r)$ which yields a simulated RDF $g_n(r)$ and a corresponding PMF $W_n(r) = -k_B T \\ln(g_n(r))$. The goal is to obtain the target RDF, $g_{\\text{target}}(r)$, which corresponds to a target PMF, $W_{\\text{target}}(r) = -k_B T \\ln(g_{\\text{target}}(r))$.\n\nThe IBI update proposes a correction to the potential, $\\Delta V_n(r)$, that is based on the mismatch between the current structure and the target structure. The update for the potential to be used in the next iteration, $V_{n+1}(r)$, is constructed as:\n$$V_{n+1}(r) = V_n(r) + \\Delta V_n(r)$$\nThe correction term is chosen to compensate for the difference in the PMFs. The rationale is that the difference between the pair potential $V(r)$ and the PMF $W(r)$ stems from many-body contributions, which are assumed to change slowly between iterations. Thus, we approximate the required potential correction by the difference between the target and current PMFs:\n$$\\Delta V_n(r) \\approx W_{\\text{target}}(r) - W_n(r)$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the PMFs:\n$$\\Delta V_n(r) = \\left(-k_B T \\ln(g_{\\text{target}}(r))\\right) - \\left(-k_B T \\ln(g_n(r))\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta V_n(r) = k_B T \\left(\\ln(g_n(r)) - \\ln(g_{\\text{target}}(r))\\right)$$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$:\n$$\\Delta V_n(r) = k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{g_n(r)}{g_{\\text{target}}(r)}\\right)$$\nThe full update rule for the potential is therefore:\n$$V_{n+1}(r) = V_n(r) + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{g_n(r)}{g_{\\text{target}}(r)}\\right)$$\nIn practice, a damping factor $\\alpha \\in (0, 1]$ is often introduced, $V_{n+1}(r) = V_n(r) + \\alpha k_B T \\ln(g_n(r)/g_{\\text{target}}(r))$, to improve numerical stability, but the problem implies $\\alpha=1$.\n\nThe physical reasoning for this update rule is as follows:\n1.  If $g_n(r)  g_{\\text{target}}(r)$, the current RDF shows an overpopulation of pairs at distance $r$. This implies that the potential $V_n(r)$ is too attractive (or not repulsive enough). To correct this, the potential must be increased (made more repulsive). The update term's argument $\\frac{g_n(r)}{g_{\\text{target}}(r)}  1$, making its logarithm positive, so $\\Delta V_n(r)  0$. This correctly increases the potential.\n2.  If $g_n(r)  g_{\\text{target}}(r)$, the current RDF shows an underpopulation of pairs at distance $r$. This means $V_n(r)$ is too repulsive. The potential must be decreased (made more attractive). The argument $\\frac{g_n(r)}{g_{\\text{target}}(r)}  1$, making its logarithm negative, so $\\Delta V_n(r)  0$. This correctly decreases the potential.\n3.  If $g_n(r) = g_{\\text{target}}(r)$, the structure is correct at this distance, and no update is needed. The argument of the logarithm is $1$, making the logarithm $0$, so $\\Delta V_n(r) = 0$. The potential remains unchanged, which is the desired behavior.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $V_{n+1}(r)$ at $r = 0.70$.\nThe given data are:\n- $k_B T = 2.5$\n- At $r = 0.70$:\n  - $V_n(0.70) = 2.5$\n  - $g_n(0.70) = 0.40$\n  - $g_{\\text{target}}(0.70) = 0.50$\n\nUsing the derived update formula:\n$$V_{n+1}(0.70) = V_n(0.70) + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{g_n(0.70)}{g_{\\text{target}}(0.70)}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$V_{n+1}(0.70) = 2.5 + 2.5 \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.40}{0.50}\\right)$$\n$$V_{n+1}(0.70) = 2.5 + 2.5 \\ln(0.8)$$\nThe natural logarithm of $0.8$ is approximately $-0.22314355$.\n$$V_{n+1}(0.70) \\approx 2.5 + 2.5 \\times (-0.22314355)$$\n$$V_{n+1}(0.70) \\approx 2.5 - 0.55785888$$\n$$V_{n+1}(0.70) \\approx 1.94214112$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $1.942$.\n\nFinally, we address the special case where $g_n(r) = 0$, as observed at $r=0.60$.\nThe statistical-mechanical interpretation of $g(r)$ is that it is proportional to the probability density of finding a pair of particles at separation $r$. A value of $g_n(r)=0$ in a simulation of finite duration means that no particle pairs were observed within that distance bin. This is typically due to a strongly repulsive potential core (i.e., excluded volume) or insufficient sampling for a high-energy configuration.\nIf we apply the IBI update rule directly where $g_n(r) = 0$:\n$$V_{n+1}(r) = V_n(r) + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{0}{g_{\\text{target}}(r)}\\right)$$\nThe term $\\ln(0)$ is undefined, approaching $-\\infty$. This would lead to a numerically catastrophic update, attempting to set $V_{n+1}(r) \\to -\\infty$. This is an artifact of finite sampling; a zero-count event does not imply an impossible event (zero probability), but rather a low-probability event that was not observed. The resulting infinite attractive correction is unphysical.\n\nTo handle this, the update rule must be regularized. A robust implementation should not use the direct formula at bins where $g_n(r)=0$. A common and physically sensible procedure is:\n1.  Recognize that $g_n(r)=0$ while $g_{\\text{target}}(r)  0$ (here, $g_{\\text{target}}(0.60) = 0.02$) indicates that the current potential $V_n(r)$ is excessively repulsive.\n2.  Instead of using the logarithmic formula, apply a heuristic correction. For instance, the update can be capped or replaced with a reasonable, finite attractive correction. One such method is to enforce a linear extrapolation of the potential from a neighboring region where $g_n(r)$ is non-zero and well-behaved.\n3.  Another simple and effective method is to apply a large but finite attractive kick to the potential. For example, one could set $V_{n+1}(r) = V_n(r) - C$, where $C$ is a constant on the order of a few $k_B T$. This lowers the potential barrier, making the region accessible in the next simulation iteration, so that a non-zero $g_{n+1}(r)$ can be sampled, allowing the standard IBI update to be used thereafter. The goal is to correct the potential just enough to populate the bin in the next step, avoiding the numerical singularity.",

The integration limits change from $[ \\sigma, \\infty )$ to $[ 0, \\infty )$.\n$$\nI_{virial} = \\frac{2\\epsilon}{\\lambda^2} \\int_0^\\infty (\\lambda x + \\sigma)^3 (\\lambda x) \\exp(-x^2) (\\lambda dx)\n= 2\\epsilon \\int_0^\\infty x (\\lambda x + \\sigma)^3 \\exp(-x^2) dx\n$$\nExpanding the cubic term: $(\\lambda x + \\sigma)^3 = \\lambda^3 x^3 + 3\\lambda^2\\sigma x^2 + 3\\lambda\\sigma^2 x + \\sigma^3$.\n$$\nI_{virial} = 2\\epsilon \\int_0^\\infty (\\lambda^3 x^4 + 3\\lambda^2\\sigma x^3 + 3\\lambda\\sigma^2 x^2 + \\sigma^3 x) \\exp(-x^2) dx\n$$\nThis requires solving integrals of the form $\\int_0^\\infty x^n \\exp(-x^2) dx = \\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)$, where $\\Gamma(z)$ is the Gamma function.\nThe required integrals are:\n$J_4 = \\int_0^\\infty x^4 \\exp(-x^2) dx = \\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma(\\frac{5}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{3}{2}\\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}{8}$\n$J_3 = \\int_0^\\infty x^3 \\exp(-x^2) dx = \\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma(2) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$J_2 = \\int_0^\\infty x^2 \\exp(-x^2) dx = \\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma(\\frac{3}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{4}$\n$J_1 = \\int_0^\\infty x \\exp(-x^2) dx = \\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma(1) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSubstituting these results:\n$$\nI_{virial} = 2\\epsilon \\left[ \\lambda^3 \\frac{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}{8} + 3\\lambda^2\\sigma \\frac{1}{2} + 3\\lambda\\sigma^2 \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{4} + \\sigma^3 \\frac{1}{2} \\right]\n$$\nNow, substitute $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma$:\n$$\nI_{virial} = 2\\epsilon \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\sigma^3}{8}\\right) \\frac{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}{8} + 3\\left(\\frac{\\sigma^2}{4}\\right)\\sigma \\frac{1}{2} + 3\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{2}\\right)\\sigma^2 \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{4} + \\frac{\\sigma^3}{2} \\right]\n$$\n$$\nI_{virial} = 2\\epsilon\\sigma^3 \\left[ \\frac{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}{64} + \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}{8} + \\frac{1}{2} \\right]\n= 2\\epsilon\\sigma^3 \\left[ \\frac{3\\sqrt{\\pi} + 24\\sqrt{\\pi}}{64} + \\frac{3+4}{8} \\right]\n$$\n$$\nI_{virial} = 2\\epsilon\\sigma^3 \\left[ \\frac{27\\sqrt{\\pi}}{64} + \\frac{7}{8} \\right] = 2\\epsilon\\sigma^3 \\left[ \\frac{27\\sqrt{\\pi} + 56}{64} \\right] = \\epsilon\\sigma^3 \\frac{27\\sqrt{\\pi} + 56}{32}\n$$\nNow we assemble the pressure $P_{\\mathrm{CG}}$:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{CG}} = \\rho k_B T - \\frac{2\\pi \\rho^2}{3} I_{virial}\n$$\nSubstitute $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{-3}$ and the expression for $I_{virial}$:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{CG}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\sigma^3} - \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\sigma^{-6}\\right) \\left(\\epsilon\\sigma^3 \\frac{27\\sqrt{\\pi} + 56}{32}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{CG}} = \\frac{\\epsilon}{2\\sigma^3} - \\frac{\\pi\\epsilon}{6\\sigma^3} \\frac{27\\sqrt{\\pi} + 56}{32}\n= \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\sigma^3} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\pi(27\\sqrt{\\pi} + 56)}{192} \\right]\n$$\nThe problem asks for the pressure mismatch $\\Delta P = P^{\\star} - P_{\\mathrm{CG}}$.
