            "solution": "The problem asks for the analysis of the sequence of functionals $F_{n}:\\mathbb{R}\\to[0,+\\infty)$ defined by $F_{n}(u)=\\min\\left\\{|u|^{2},\\,|u-n|^{2}\\right\\}$ for each $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, on the metric space $(\\mathbb{R}, d)$ where $d(u,v)=|u-v|$. We will determine the $\\Gamma$-limit, address equi-coercivity, and analyze the behavior of minimizers.\n\nFirst, we derive the $\\Gamma$-limit functional $F(u)$. We postulate a candidate for the limit by computing the pointwise limit of $F_{n}(u)$ as $n\\to\\infty$. For any fixed $u\\in\\mathbb{R}$, the term $|u|^{2}$ is constant with respect to $n$, while the term $|u-n|^{2}$ grows quadratically with $n$. For sufficiently large $n$, we will have $|u-n|^{2} > |u|^{2}$. Specifically, this inequality is equivalent to $(u-n)^{2} > u^{2}$, which simplifies to $u^{2}-2nu+n^{2} > u^{2}$, or $n(n-2u) > 0$. Since $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, this holds for any $n > 2u$. Thus, for any fixed $u$, there exists an $N\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n>N$, $F_{n}(u) = |u|^{2}$. The pointwise limit is therefore:\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} F_{n}(u) = |u|^{2}.\n$$\nLet's propose $F(u) = u^{2}$ as the candidate for the $\\Gamma$-limit and verify the two conditions from the definition of $\\Gamma$-convergence.\n\n(i) The liminf inequality: We must show that for any $u\\in\\mathbb{R}$ and any sequence $(u_{n})_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ such that $u_{n}\\to u$, we have $\\liminf_{n\\to\\infty}F_{n}(u_{n})\\ge F(u) = u^{2}$.\nLet $u_{n}\\to u$ in $\\mathbb{R}$. Since $(u_{n})$ converges, it is a bounded sequence. This means there exists a constant $M>0$ such that $|u_{n}| \\le M$ for all $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$.\nThe functional is $F_{n}(u_{n}) = \\min\\left\\{|u_{n}|^{2},\\,|u_{n}-n|^{2}\\right\\}$.\nLet's compare the two terms in the minimum. The term $|u_{n}|^{2}$ converges to $|u|^{2}$ as $n\\to\\infty$ due to the continuity of the square function.\nThe second term $|u_{n}-n|^{2}$ behaves differently. We have $|u_{n}-n|^{2} - |u_{n}|^{2} = n(n-2u_{n})$. Since $u_{n}\\to u$, for any $\\epsilon>0$, there is an $N_{1}$ such that for $n>N_{1}$, $|u_{n}-u|<\\epsilon$, so $u-\\epsilon < u_{n} < u+\\epsilon$.\nThis implies that for $n$ large enough, specifically for $n > 2(u+\\epsilon)$, we have $n > 2u_{n}$, and thus $n(n-2u_{n}) > 0$. Therefore, for all sufficiently large $n$, we have $|u_{n}-n|^{2} > |u_{n}|^{2}$.\nThis means that for large enough $n$, the minimum is determined by the first term:\n$$\nF_{n}(u_{n}) = |u_{n}|^{2}.\n$$\nTaking the limit inferior as $n\\to\\infty$, we get:\n$$\n\\liminf_{n\\to\\infty} F_{n}(u_{n}) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} |u_{n}|^{2} = |u|^{2} = F(u).\n$$\nThe condition $\\liminf_{n\\to\\infty} F_{n}(u_{n}) \\ge F(u)$ is satisfied.\n\n(ii) The limsup inequality (existence of a recovery sequence): We must show that for any $u\\in\\mathbb{R}$, there exists a sequence $(u_{n})$ with $u_{n}\\to u$ such that $\\limsup_{n\\to\\infty}F_{n}(u_{n})\\le F(u) = u^{2}$.\nThe simplest choice for a recovery sequence is the constant sequence $u_{n}=u$ for all $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$. This sequence trivially converges to $u$.\nLet's evaluate the limit of $F_{n}(u)$ for this sequence:\n$$\nF_{n}(u) = \\min\\left\\{|u|^{2},\\,|u-n|^{2}\\right\\}.\n$$\nAs established earlier, for a fixed $u$, when $n\\to\\infty$, we have $|u-n|^{2} \\to \\infty$. Thus, for $n$ large enough ($n>2u$), $F_{n}(u) = |u|^{2}$.\nTherefore, the limit exists and we have:\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} F_{n}(u) = |u|^{2}.\n$$\nThis implies that $\\limsup_{n\\to\\infty} F_{n}(u) = |u|^{2} = F(u)$, satisfying the inequality.\nSince both conditions hold for $F(u)=u^{2}$, we have proven that $(F_{n})$ $\\Gamma$-converges to $F(u)=u^{2}$.\n\nNext, we prove that the sequence $(F_{n})$ is not equi-coercive.\nA sequence of functionals $(F_{n})$ is equi-coercive if for every $c\\in\\mathbb{R}$, there exists a compact set $K_{c}\\subset\\mathbb{R}$ such that for all $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, the sublevel set $S_{n}(c) := \\{u\\in \\mathbb{R}:\\,F_{n}(u)\\le c\\}$ is contained in $K_{c}$. In $\\mathbb{R}$, a compact set is a closed and bounded set. This requires the union of all sublevel sets $\\bigcup_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}S_{n}(c)$ to be bounded for any $c$.\nLet's choose $c=1$. The sublevel set $S_{n}(1)$ is described by the inequality $F_{n}(u) \\le 1$, which is $\\min\\{|u|^{2}, |u-n|^{2}\\} \\le 1$.\nThis inequality holds if and only if $|u|^{2} \\le 1$ or $|u-n|^{2} \\le 1$.\n$|u|^{2} \\le 1 \\iff -1 \\le u \\le 1 \\iff u \\in [-1,1]$.\n$|u-n|^{2} \\le 1 \\iff -1 \\le u-n \\le 1 \\iff u \\in [n-1, n+1]$.\nSo, the sublevel set for a given $n$ is $S_{n}(1) = [-1,1] \\cup [n-1, n+1]$.\nTo check for equi-coercivity, we consider the union of these sets over all $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$:\n$$\n\\bigcup_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}} S_{n}(1) = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left( [-1,1] \\cup [n-1, n+1] \\right) = [-1,1] \\cup \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} [n-1, n+1].\n$$\nThe union of the intervals $[n-1, n+1]$ for $n \\ge 1$ is $[0,2] \\cup [1,3] \\cup [2,4] \\cup \\dots$, which covers the entire half-line $[0, \\infty)$.\nThus, $\\bigcup_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}} S_{n}(1) = [-1,1] \\cup [0,\\infty) = [-1, \\infty)$.\nThis set is unbounded. Therefore, it cannot be contained in any compact set $K_{1} \\subset \\mathbb{R}$. This demonstrates that for $c=1$, the condition for equi-coercivity fails. Thus, the sequence $(F_{n})$ is not equi-coercive.\n\nFinally, we analyze the minimizers.\nFor each $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, we seek to minimize $F_{n}(u)=\\min\\{|u|^{2},|u-n|^{2}\\}$. Since squares of real numbers are non-negative, $F_{n}(u) \\ge 0$ for all $u$. The minimum value is $0$.\nThe value $0$ is achieved if either $|u|^{2}=0$ (i.e., $u=0$) or $|u-n|^{2}=0$ (i.e., $u=n$).\nAt $u=0$, $F_{n}(0)=\\min\\{0, n^{2}\\}=0$.\nAt $u=n$, $F_{n}(n)=\\min\\{n^{2}, 0\\}=0$.\nThus, for each $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, the functional $F_{n}$ has exactly two minimizers: $u=0$ and $u=n$. The set of minimizers is $\\{0, n\\}$.\n\nA minimizing sequence for $(F_{n})$ is a sequence $(u_{n})$ such that $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} F_{n}(u_{n}) = \\inf_{k \\ge 1} \\inf_{v\\in\\mathbb{R}} F_{k}(v)$.\nWe know $\\inf_{v\\in\\mathbb{R}} F_{k}(v) = 0$ for all $k$, so $\\inf_{k,v} F_{k}(v) = 0$. A minimizing sequence must satisfy $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} F_{n}(u_{n}) = 0$.\nWe can construct such a sequence by picking a minimizer of $F_{n}$ for each $n$. Consider the sequence $(u_{n})$ defined by $u_{n}=n$ for each $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$.\nFor this sequence, $F_{n}(u_{n}) = F_{n}(n) = 0$ for all $n$, so $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} F_{n}(u_{n}) = 0$. This is a valid minimizing sequence. However, the sequence $(u_{n}) = (1, 2, 3, \\dots)$ diverges as $n\\to\\infty$.\n\nThe minimizer(s) of the $\\Gamma$-limit $F(u)=u^{2}$ do not exhibit such behavior. The functional $F(u)=u^{2}$ has a unique global minimizer at $u=0$, since $u^{2}\\ge 0$ for all $u\\in\\mathbb{R}$ and $u^{2}=0$ only if $u=0$.\n\nThe fundamental theorem of $\\Gamma$-convergence states that if a sequence of functionals $(F_{n})$ $\\Gamma$-converges to $F$ and is equi-coercive, then any sequence of minimizers $(u_{n})$ of $F_{n}$ is pre-compact, and all of its cluster points are minimizers of $F$. In our problem, we have $\\Gamma$-convergence, but we have explicitly shown the lack of equi-coercivity. The existence of the divergent sequence of minimizers $(u_{n}=n)$ illustrates the consequence of this missing condition. The sequence $(u_{n})$ is not pre-compact, and its \"limit\" (at infinity) is not a minimizer of $F$. This example demonstrates that $\\Gamma$-convergence by itself is insufficient to guarantee the convergence of minimizers to a minimizer of the limit functional; an additional compactness condition like equi-coercivity is essential.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is a standard, well-posed problem in the calculus of variations, specifically within the theory of $\\Gamma$-convergence as applied to phase transition models. It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and all terms are well-defined. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for three related tasks: the derivation of the one-dimensional optimal transition profile, the construction of a recovery sequence for the $\\Gamma$-limsup inequality, and the explicit computation of the sharp-interface energy density constant $c_0$. We shall address each in turn.\n\nFirst, to find the optimal one-dimensional transition profile, we consider a one-dimensional version of the problem and seek to minimize the energy. Let us consider functions $u(x)$ of a single variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The energy functional is\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{\\varepsilon}(u) \\;=\\; \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon}{2} |u'(x)|^{2} \\;+\\; \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} W(u(x)) \\right)\\, \\mathrm{d}x.\n$$\nWe introduce a rescaled spatial variable $y = x / \\varepsilon$, and define a function $q(y) = u(\\varepsilon y)$. Then $u'(x) = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} q'(y)$ and $\\mathrm{d}x = \\varepsilon \\, \\mathrm{d}y$. Substituting these into the energy functional yields\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{\\varepsilon}(u) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} q'(y)\\right)^{2} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} W(q(y)) \\right) \\varepsilon \\, \\mathrm{d}y = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} |q'(y)|^{2} + W(q(y)) \\right)\\, \\mathrm{d}y.\n$$\nThe minimization of this rescaled energy functional for a profile $q$ connecting $-1$ and $+1$ corresponds precisely to finding the infimum value $c_0$. A minimizer for this problem is a solution to the associated Euler-Lagrange equation. The Lagrangian is $L(q, q') = \\frac{1}{2}(q')^2 + W(q)$. The Euler-Lagrange equation is\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}y} \\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q'}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q} = 0 \\quad\\implies\\quad q''(y) - W'(q(y)) = 0.\n$$\nGiven the potential $W(s) = \\frac{1}{4}(1-s^2)^2$, its derivative is $W'(s) = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 2(1-s^2) \\cdot (-2s) = s^3 - s$. The Euler-Lagrange equation is a second-order autonomous ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\nq''(y) = q(y)^3 - q(y).\n$$\nWe seek a heteroclinic solution with boundary conditions $\\lim_{y\\to-\\infty} q(y) = -1$ and $\\lim_{y\\to+\\infty} q(y) = +1$. We can find a first integral of this ODE by multiplying by $q'$:\n$$\nq'(y) q''(y) = (q(y)^3 - q(y)) q'(y) \\implies \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}y} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} (q'(y))^2 \\right) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}y} \\left( W(q(y)) \\right).\n$$\nIntegrating with respect to $y$ gives $\\frac{1}{2}(q'(y))^2 = W(q(y)) + C$. The constant $C$ is determined by the boundary conditions. As $y \\to \\pm\\infty$, we must have $q'(y) \\to 0$ and $q(y) \\to \\pm 1$. Since $W(\\pm 1) = 0$, we find that $C=0$. This gives the first integral, also known as the Beltrami identity for this variational problem:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}(q'(y))^2 = W(q(y)).\n$$\nFor a monotone increasing profile connecting $-1$ to $+1$, we have $q'(y) > 0$ and $q(y) \\in (-1, 1)$. We take the positive square root:\n$$\nq'(y) = \\sqrt{2 W(q(y))} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}(1-q(y)^2)^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |1 - q(y)^2|.\n$$\nFor $q \\in (-1, 1)$, $1-q^2 > 0$, so we can drop the absolute value. This yields a first-order separable ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}q}{\\mathrm{d}y} = \\frac{1-q^2}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n$$\nSeparating variables and integrating, we have\n$$\n\\int \\frac{\\mathrm{d}q}{1-q^2} = \\int \\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\sqrt{2}} \\quad\\implies\\quad \\operatorname{arctanh}(q) = \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{2}} + C_1.\n$$\nSetting the integration constant $C_1=0$ centers the profile at $y=0$ (i.e., $q(0)=0$). The resulting explicit monotone heteroclinic profile is\n$$\nq(y) = \\tanh\\left(\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right).\n$$\nThis function correctly connects the wells, as $\\lim_{y \\to \\pm\\infty} \\tanh(y/\\sqrt{2}) = \\pm 1$.\n\nSecond, we address the construction of a recovery sequence. For a given smooth set $E \\subset \\Omega$, let $d(x)$ be the signed distance function to its boundary $\\partial E$, defined as negative inside $E$ and positive outside. A recovery sequence $\\{u_\\varepsilon\\}$ is a sequence of functions in the correct function space such that $\\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0} u_\\varepsilon = \\chi_{\\Omega \\setminus E} - \\chi_E$ in $L^1(\\Omega)$ and $\\limsup_{\\varepsilon \\to 0} \\mathcal{E}_\\varepsilon(u_\\varepsilon)$ is bounded by the candidate $\\Gamma$-limit energy. We construct it by composing the optimal 1D profile with the rescaled signed distance function:\n$$\nu_\\varepsilon(x) = q\\left(\\frac{d(x)}{\\varepsilon}\\right) = \\tanh\\left(\\frac{d(x)}{\\sqrt{2}\\varepsilon}\\right).\n$$\nThis function transitions from approximately $-1$ (inside $E$) to $+1$ (outside $E$) in a layer of width $O(\\varepsilon)$ around $\\partial E$. The energy of this configuration is\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{\\varepsilon}(u_{\\varepsilon}) \\;=\\; \\int_{\\Omega} \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon}{2} |\\nabla u_{\\varepsilon}(x)|^{2} \\;+\\; \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} W(u_{\\varepsilon}(x)) \\right)\\, \\mathrm{d}x.\n$$\nThe gradient is $\\nabla u_\\varepsilon(x) = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} q'(d(x)/\\varepsilon) \\nabla d(x)$. Since $|\\nabla d(x)|=1$ in a neighborhood of $\\partial E$, the energy integrand becomes\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\left[q'\\left(\\frac{d(x)}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\right]^2 + W\\left(q\\left(\\frac{d(x)}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\right) \\right).\n$$\nThis term is negligible away from $\\partial E$, as $q$ approaches $\\pm 1$ and $q'$ approaches $0$. The energy is concentrated in the transition layer. Using the coarea formula and a change of variables $y = d(x)/\\varepsilon$, the energy can be shown to converge as $\\varepsilon \\to 0^+$:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0} \\mathcal{E}_{\\varepsilon}(u_{\\varepsilon}) = \\left(\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} |q'(y)|^{2} + W(q(y)) \\right)\\, \\mathrm{d}y\\right) \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(\\partial E).\n$$\nThe term in parentheses is precisely $c_0$. Thus, the sharp-interface energy density $c_0$ arises as the total energy cost of the optimal one-dimensional transition, integrated across the transition direction. The limit of the energies of the recovery sequence is $c_0 \\cdot \\operatorname{Per}(E)$, which establishes the $\\Gamma$-limsup inequality required for the proof of $\\Gamma$-convergence.\n\nThird, we compute the constant $c_0$ explicitly. The functional to be minimized is\n$$\nc_{0} \\;=\\; \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} |q'(y)|^{2} + W(q(y)) \\right)\\, \\mathrm{d}y,\n$$\nwhere the infimum is taken over suitable functions $q$. The minimum is achieved by the optimal profile found above. Using the first integral $\\frac{1}{2}(q')^2 = W(q)$, we can simplify the integrand:\n$$\nc_{0} = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} (W(q(y)) + W(q(y))) \\, \\mathrm{d}y = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} 2W(q(y))\\, \\mathrm{d}y.\n$$\nA more direct method of computation uses the relation $q'(y) = \\sqrt{2W(q(y))}$:\n$$\nc_{0} = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\sqrt{2W(q(y))} \\, q'(y) \\, \\mathrm{d}y.\n$$\nWe can change the integration variable from $y$ to $s = q(y)$. As $y$ ranges from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$, $s$ ranges from $-1$ to $+1$. The differential becomes $\\mathrm{d}s = q'(y)\\mathrm{d}y$. The integral transforms into:\n$$\nc_{0} = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\sqrt{2W(s)} \\, \\mathrm{d}s.\n$$\nSubstituting $W(s) = \\frac{1}{4}(1-s^2)^2$:\n$$\nc_{0} = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\sqrt{2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}(1-s^2)^2} \\, \\mathrm{d}s = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|1-s^2| \\, \\mathrm{d}s.\n$$\nSince $s \\in [-1, 1]$, $1-s^2 \\geq 0$, so the absolute value can be removed.\n$$\nc_{0} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\int_{-1}^{1} (1-s^2) \\, \\mathrm{d}s.\n$$\nThe integrand is an even function, so we can simplify the calculation:\n$$\nc_{0} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} \\int_{0}^{1} (1-s^2) \\, \\mathrm{d}s = \\sqrt{2} \\left[ s - \\frac{s^3}{3} \\right]_{0}^{1}.\n$$\nEvaluating the definite integral:\n$$\nc_{0} = \\sqrt{2} \\left( \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3}\\right) - (0) \\right) = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3}.\n$$\nThis is the exact analytical expression for the one-dimensional minimal transition cost.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid and well-posed mathematical problem in the field of homogenization and variational analysis. It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and objective. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the limit of the first Dirichlet eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{\\varepsilon}$, for the Laplace operator on a periodically perforated domain $\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}$, as the period $\\varepsilon$ tends to zero. The domain $\\Omega = (0,1)^2$ is perforated by removing a grid of small disks of a critically scaled radius $r_{\\varepsilon} = \\exp(-\\frac{2\\pi}{\\mu}\\varepsilon^{-2})$. The method to be used is Γ-convergence.\n\nThe first eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\varepsilon}$ is given by the Rayleigh-Ritz formula:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\varepsilon} = \\inf_{\\substack{u \\in H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}) \\\\ u \\neq 0}} \\frac{\\mathcal{E}_{\\varepsilon}(u)}{\\displaystyle \\int_{\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}} |u(x)|^{2}\\,dx},\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{E}_{\\varepsilon}(u) = \\int_{\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}} |\\nabla u(x)|^{2}\\,dx$ is the Dirichlet energy. We can view $u \\in H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon})$ as an element of $L^{2}(\\Omega)$ by extending it by zero inside the holes. With this convention, the normalization constraint becomes $\\|u\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)} = 1$. The energy functional is then defined on all of $L^2(\\Omega)$ by setting $\\mathcal{E}_{\\varepsilon}(u) = +\\infty$ if $u$ is not in $H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon})$.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in determining the effective behavior of the energy functionals $\\mathcal{E}_{\\varepsilon}$ as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$. This is achieved by finding the $\\Gamma$-limit of the sequence of functionals $(\\mathcal{E}_{\\varepsilon})$ in the topology of $L^{2}(\\Omega)$.\n\nA sequence of functionals $F_{\\varepsilon}$ is said to $\\Gamma$-converge to a functional $F_{0}$ in a topological space $X$ if for every $u \\in X$:\n1.  (Liminf inequality) For every sequence $u_{\\varepsilon}$ converging to $u$ in $X$, we have $F_{0}(u) \\le \\liminf_{\\varepsilon \\to 0} F_{\\varepsilon}(u_{\\varepsilon})$.\n2.  (Limsup inequality / recovery sequence) There exists a sequence $u_{\\varepsilon}$ converging to $u$ in $X$ such that $F_{0}(u) \\ge \\limsup_{\\varepsilon \\to 0} F_{\\varepsilon}(u_{\\varepsilon})$.\n\nFor the specific problem at hand, it is a celebrated result of homogenization theory, established by D. Cioranescu and F. Murat, that the sequence of functionals $\\mathcal{E}_{\\varepsilon}$ $\\Gamma$-converges in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$ to the functional $\\mathcal{E}_{0}$ defined on $H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega)$ by:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{0}(u) = \\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla u(x)|^{2}\\,dx + \\mu \\int_{\\Omega} |u(x)|^{2}\\,dx\n$$\nand $\\mathcal{E}_{0}(u) = +\\infty$ for $u \\in L^{2}(\\Omega) \\setminus H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega)$.\n\nThe appearance of the extra term, $\\mu \\int_{\\Omega} |u(x)|^{2}\\,dx$, often called a \"strange term\", is a consequence of the critical scaling of the hole radius $r_{\\varepsilon}$. A heuristic justification can be given by considering the notion of capacity. The capacity of a small disk of radius $r$ inside a larger domain of characteristic size $L$ in two dimensions scales as $(\\ln(L/r))^{-1}$. In our problem, the reference cell has size $\\varepsilon$ and the hole radius is $r_{\\varepsilon}$. The capacity of a single hole is thus proportional to $(\\ln(\\varepsilon/r_{\\varepsilon}))^{-1}$. Using the given radius scaling, $r_{\\varepsilon} = \\exp(-\\frac{2\\pi}{\\mu}\\varepsilon^{-2})$:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon}{r_{\\varepsilon}}\\right) = \\ln(\\varepsilon) - \\ln(r_{\\varepsilon}) = \\ln(\\varepsilon) + \\frac{2\\pi}{\\mu}\\varepsilon^{-2}.\n$$\nAs $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, the dominant term is $\\frac{2\\pi}{\\mu}\\varepsilon^{-2}$. The capacity of one hole is therefore approximately proportional to $(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\mu}\\varepsilon^{-2})^{-1} = \\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi}\\varepsilon^2$. The number of holes in $\\Omega$ is approximately $|\\Omega|/\\varepsilon^2 = 1/\\varepsilon^2$. The total capacity, which represents the aggregate effect of all holes, is the product of the number of holes and the capacity per hole:\n$$\n\\text{Total Capacity} \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi} \\cdot 2\\pi\\varepsilon^2\\right) = \\mu,\n$$\nwhere a factor of $2\\pi$ has been included to match the standard definition of capacity. This heuristic confirms that the constant $\\mu$ in the scaling of $r_{\\varepsilon}$ directly becomes the coefficient of the zero-order term in the limiting energy functional.\n\nA general theorem of Γ-convergence states that if a sequence of equi-coercive functionals $\\mathcal{E}_\\varepsilon$ $\\Gamma$-converges to $\\mathcal{E}_0$, then the minimum values converge, and the minimizers of $\\mathcal{E}_\\varepsilon$ converge (up to a subsequence) to a minimizer of $\\mathcal{E}_0$. In our case, the eigenvalue problem can be seen as minimizing the functional $\\mathcal{E}_{\\varepsilon}(u)$ subject to the constraint $\\int_{\\Omega} |u(x)|^2 dx = 1$. The strong convergence of the constraint functional and the $\\Gamma$-convergence of the energy functional ensure that the limit of the eigenvalues $\\lambda_{\\varepsilon}$ is the first eigenvalue $\\lambda_{0}$ of the limiting problem.\n\nThe limiting problem is to find:\n$$\n\\lambda_{0} = \\inf_{\\substack{u \\in H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega) \\\\ \\|u\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)}=1}} \\mathcal{E}_{0}(u) = \\inf_{\\substack{u \\in H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega) \\\\ u \\neq 0}} \\frac{\\displaystyle\\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla u(x)|^{2}\\,dx + \\mu \\int_{\\Omega} |u(x)|^{2}\\,dx}{\\displaystyle\\int_{\\Omega} |u(x)|^{2}\\,dx}.\n$$\nThis is the Rayleigh quotient for the operator $A = -\\Delta + \\mu I$ on the domain $\\Omega$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The value $\\lambda_{0}$ is the first (smallest) eigenvalue of this operator. The corresponding eigenvalue equation is:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n-\\Delta u(x) + \\mu u(x) = \\lambda u(x) & \\text{in } \\Omega \\\\\nu(x) = 0 & \\text{on } \\partial\\Omega\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as a standard eigenvalue problem for the Dirichlet Laplacian:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n-\\Delta u(x) = (\\lambda - \\mu) u(x) & \\text{in } \\Omega \\\\\nu(x) = 0 & \\text{on } \\partial\\Omega\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nLet $\\sigma$ be an eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian $-\\Delta$ on $\\Omega=(0,1)^2$. Then the eigenvalues of our operator $-\\Delta+\\mu I$ are of the form $\\lambda = \\sigma + \\mu$. We are interested in the first eigenvalue $\\lambda_0$, which corresponds to the first eigenvalue $\\sigma_1$ of $-\\Delta$.\n$\\lambda_0 = \\sigma_1 + \\mu$.\n\nWe now compute the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplacian on the unit square $\\Omega=(0,1)^2$. The eigenfunctions are of the form $u_{m,n}(x_1, x_2) = \\sin(m\\pi x_1)\\sin(n\\pi x_2)$ for integers $m, n \\ge 1$. Applying the Laplacian:\n$$\n-\\Delta u_{m,n} = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_1^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_2^2}\\right) \\sin(m\\pi x_1)\\sin(n\\pi x_2) = (m^2\\pi^2 + n^2\\pi^2) u_{m,n} = \\pi^2(m^2+n^2) u_{m,n}.\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplacian on $\\Omega$ are thus $\\sigma_{m,n} = \\pi^2(m^2+n^2)$ for $m, n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$.\n\nThe first eigenvalue $\\sigma_1$ is the minimum of these values. The minimum of $m^2+n^2$ for $m,n \\ge 1$ occurs when $m=1$ and $n=1$.\n$$\n\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_{1,1} = \\pi^2(1^2+1^2) = 2\\pi^2.\n$$\nThe limit of the first eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\varepsilon}$ is therefore the first eigenvalue of the limiting operator, $\\lambda_0$.\n$$\n\\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0} \\lambda_{\\varepsilon} = \\lambda_0 = \\sigma_1 + \\mu = 2\\pi^2 + \\mu.\n$$\nThis is the final result.",
