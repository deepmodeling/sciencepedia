            "solution": "The problem requires us to derive the invariant distribution, denoted by $\\pi$, for a discrete-time Markov chain on the state space $\\{0, 1, \\dots, N\\}$. We must start from the provided transition probabilities and the definition of detailed balance, verify that this condition holds for adjacent states, and determine the constant value of the invariant probability for each state.\n\nThe state space is $S = \\{0, 1, \\dots, N\\}$, where $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $N \\geq 2$. The total number of states is $N+1$. The non-zero transition probabilities $P(i,j)$ are given as:\nFor interior states $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N-1\\}$:\n$$\nP(i, i-1) = \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad P(i, i+1) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nFor the boundary state $i=0$:\n$$\nP(0, 0) = \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad P(0, 1) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nFor the boundary state $i=N$:\n$$\nP(N, N) = \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad P(N, N-1) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nAn invariant distribution $\\pi$ is a probability distribution that satisfies the global balance condition $\\sum_{i \\in S} \\pi(i) P(i,j) = \\pi(j)$ for all $j \\in S$. The detailed balance condition is a stronger condition given by:\n$$\n\\pi(i) P(i,j) = \\pi(j) P(j,i) \\quad \\text{for all } i, j \\in S\n$$\nIf a distribution $\\pi$ satisfies the detailed balance condition, it is guaranteed to satisfy the global balance condition and is therefore an invariant distribution. We will use this principle to find $\\pi$. Our approach is to assume that such a $\\pi$ exists and satisfies detailed balance, and then use this assumption to determine the form of $\\pi$.\n\nWe will systematically check the detailed balance condition for all pairs of adjacent states $(i, i+1)$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$.\n\nCase 1: The boundary pair $(0, 1)$.\nThe detailed balance equation for this pair is $\\pi(0) P(0,1) = \\pi(1) P(1,0)$.\nFrom the problem statement, we have $P(0,1) = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $P(1,0) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSubstituting these values gives:\n$$\n\\pi(0) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\pi(1) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThis implies $\\pi(0) = \\pi(1)$.\n\nCase 2: Interior pairs $(i, i+1)$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N-2\\}$.\nThe detailed balance equation is $\\pi(i) P(i,i+1) = \\pi(i+1) P(i+1,i)$.\nThe transition probabilities for these states are $P(i, i+1) = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $P(i+1, i) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\n\\pi(i) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\pi(i+1) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThis implies $\\pi(i) = \\pi(i+1)$ for all $i = 1, 2, \\dots, N-2$.\n\nCase 3: The boundary pair $(N-1, N)$.\nThe detailed balance equation is $\\pi(N-1) P(N-1,N) = \\pi(N) P(N,N-1)$.\nThe transition probabilities are $P(N-1, N) = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $P(N, N-1) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\n\\pi(N-1) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\pi(N) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThis implies $\\pi(N-1) = \\pi(N)$.\n\nCombining the results from all cases, we have a chain of equalities:\n$$\n\\pi(0) = \\pi(1) = \\pi(2) = \\dots = \\pi(N-1) = \\pi(N)\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the invariant distribution must be a uniform distribution over the state space. Let us denote the common value of the probability for each state by $c$, so $\\pi(i) = c$ for all $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N\\}$.\n\nWe have now verified the detailed balance condition for all adjacent pairs, as requested. For completeness, we should also check non-adjacent pairs and self-transitions.\nFor any non-adjacent pair $(i,j)$ where $|i-j| > 1$, we have $P(i,j) = 0$ and $P(j,i) = 0$. The detailed balance condition becomes $c \\cdot 0 = c \\cdot 0$, which is trivially satisfied.\nFor self-transitions, such as at state $0$, the condition is $\\pi(0)P(0,0)=\\pi(0)P(0,0)$. With $\\pi(0)=c$ and $P(0,0)=\\frac{1}{2}$, this is $c \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = c \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}$, which is also trivially true. The same logic applies to the self-transition at state $N$.\n\nTherefore, the uniform distribution $\\pi(i)=c$ for all $i$ satisfies the detailed balance condition for all pairs of states. Since this condition holds, $\\pi$ is indeed an invariant distribution.\n\nThe final step is to determine the value of the constant $c$. Since $\\pi$ is a probability distribution, the sum of probabilities over all states must be equal to $1$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{N} \\pi(i) = 1\n$$\nSubstituting $\\pi(i)=c$ for all $i$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{N} c = 1\n$$\nThe sum consists of $N+1$ identical terms, each equal to $c$. Thus, the equation becomes:\n$$\n(N+1)c = 1\n$$\nSolving for $c$, we find the value of the invariant probability for each state:\n$$\nc = \\frac{1}{N+1}\n$$\nThis is the common value of the invariant probability assigned to each state, expressed in closed form in terms of $N$. The invariant distribution is $\\pi(i) = \\frac{1}{N+1}$ for all $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N\\}$.",

            "solution": "The solution is presented in three parts, corresponding to the tasks outlined in the problem statement.\n\n#### 1. Verification of Stationarity\n\nThe stationary condition for a discrete-time Markov chain is given by $\\pi = P^{\\top}\\pi$, where $\\pi$ is the stationary distribution vector and $P^{\\top}$ is the transpose of the transition matrix $P$.\n\nThe given transition matrix is:\n$$\nP = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\gamma & \\alpha & \\beta \\\\\n\\beta & \\gamma & \\alpha \\\\\n\\alpha & \\beta & \\gamma\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIts transpose is:\n$$\nP^{\\top} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\gamma & \\beta & \\alpha \\\\\n\\alpha & \\gamma & \\beta \\\\\n\\beta & \\alpha & \\gamma\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe proposed stationary distribution is the uniform distribution $\\pi = (\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3})^{\\top}$.

Thus, the uniform distribution $\\pi$ is indeed the stationary distribution for this Markov chain. This is expected, as the matrix $P$ is doubly stochastic (both its rows and columns sum to $1$).\n\n#### 2. Assessment of Reversibility (Detailed Balance)\n\nA Markov chain is reversible with respect to a stationary distribution $\\pi$ if it satisfies the detailed balance condition for all pairs of states $i, j$:\n$$\n\\pi(i)P(i,j) = \\pi(j)P(j,i)\n$$\nIn our case, the stationary distribution is uniform, so $\\pi(i) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. The detailed balance condition simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{3} P(i,j) = \\frac{1}{3} P(j,i) \\implies P(i,j) = P(j,i)\n$$\nThis means the chain is reversible if and only if its transition matrix $P$ is symmetric. Let's examine the symmetry of $P$:\n-   $P(1,2) = \\alpha$ and $P(2,1) = \\beta$. For symmetry, we must have $\\alpha = \\beta$.\n-   $P(1,3) = \\beta$ and $P(3,1) = \\alpha$. For symmetry, we must have $\\beta = \\alpha$.\n-   $P(2,3) = \\alpha$ and $P(3,2) = \\beta$. For symmetry, we must have $\\alpha = \\beta$.\n\nThe condition for reversibility is $\\alpha = \\beta$. We are given the specific parameter values $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\beta = \\frac{3}{10}$.\nSince $\\frac{1}{2} \\neq \\frac{3}{10}$, the condition $\\alpha = \\beta$ is not met. The matrix $P$ is not symmetric. Therefore, the detailed balance condition is not satisfied, and the Markov chain is not reversible with respect to $\\pi$. The non-reversibility implies the existence of non-zero net probability currents in the steady state.\n\n#### 3. Computation of the Steady Cycle Current\n\nThe stationary probability current along the edge from state $i$ to state $j$ is defined as $J_{i\\to j} = \\pi(i)P(i,j) - \\pi(j)P(j,i)$. We are asked to compute the current for the cycle $1\\to 2\\to 3\\to 1$.\n\nLet's compute the current for each edge in the cycle:\n-   For the edge $1\\to 2$:\n$$\nJ_{1\\to 2} = \\pi(1)P(1,2) - \\pi(2)P(2,1) = \\frac{1}{3}\\alpha - \\frac{1}{3}\\beta = \\frac{1}{3}(\\alpha - \\beta)\n$$\n-   For the edge $2\\to 3$:\n$$\nJ_{2\\to 3} = \\pi(2)P(2,3) - \\pi(3)P(3,2) = \\frac{1}{3}\\alpha - \\frac{1}{3}\\beta = \\frac{1}{3}(\\alpha - \\beta)\n$$\n-   For the edge $3\\to 1$:\n$$\nJ_{3\\to 1} = \\pi(3)P(3,1) - \\pi(1)P(1,3) = \\frac{1}{3}\\alpha - \\frac{1}{3}\\beta = \\frac{1}{3}(\\alpha - \\beta)\n$$\nAs shown, the current is the same for all edges in the cycle, a consequence of the cyclic symmetry of the transition matrix. The steady cycle current is this common value:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{cycle}} = \\frac{1}{3}(\\alpha - \\beta)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\beta = \\frac{3}{10}$:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{cycle}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{3}{10} \\right)\n$$\nTo evaluate the expression in the parenthesis:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{5}{10} - \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{1}{5}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $J_{\\mathrm{cycle}}$:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{cycle}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{1}{5} \\right) = \\frac{1}{15}\n$$\nThe positive sign of the current indicates a net probability flow in the direction of the cycle $1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 1$.\nThe exact value of the steady cycle current is $\\frac{1}{15}$.",

The distance is measured by a weighted squared Frobenius norm induced by the Hilbert space $L^2(\\pi)$. This is a constrained optimization problem, which we will formulate and solve.\n\n**1. Theoretical Foundation: Reversibility and Self-Adjointness**\n\nLet the finite state space be $\\mathcal{S} = \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$. The Hilbert space $L^2(\\pi)$ consists of real-valued functions on $\\mathcal{S}$, which can be represented by vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.

The adjoint operator $P^*$ of $P$ with respect to the $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle_{\\pi}$ inner product is uniquely defined by the relation $\\langle Pf, g \\rangle_{\\pi} = \\langle f, P^*g \\rangle_{\\pi}$ for all $f, g \\in L^2(\\pi)$.\n\nWe can derive the matrix representation of $P^*$. Let's expand both sides of the defining relation:\n$$ \\langle Pf, g \\rangle_{\\pi} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\pi_i (Pf)(i) g(i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\pi_i \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{n} P_{ij} f(j) \\right) g(i) = \\sum_{i,j} \\pi_i P_{ij} g(i) f(j) $$\n$$ \\langle f, P^*g \\rangle_{\\pi} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\pi_j f(j) (P^*g)(j) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\pi_j f(j) \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (P^*)_{ji} g(i) \\right) = \\sum_{i,j} \\pi_j (P^*)_{ji} g(i) f(j) $$\nFor these expressions to be equal for all functions $f$ and $g$, the coefficients of $f(j)g(i)$ must be equal for all $i,j$. This yields:\n$$ \\pi_i P_{ij} = \\pi_j (P^*)_{ji} $$\nFrom this, we can express the entries of the adjoint matrix $P^*$ in terms of $P$:\n$$ (P^*)_{ij} = \\frac{\\pi_j}{\\pi_i} P_{ji} $$\nAn operator $P$ is self-adjoint in $L^2(\\pi)$ if $P = P^*$.

The feasible set defined by the linear equality and inequality constraints is a convex set. The problem of minimizing a strictly convex function over a non-empty, closed, convex set has a unique solution. This formulation is a Quadratic Program (QP).\n\nThe full optimization problem is stated as:\n$$ \\underset{P \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}}{\\text{minimize}} \\quad \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\pi_i \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (P_{ij} - K_{ij})^2 $$\nSubject to:\n$$ \\begin{cases} \\pi_i P_{ij} - \\pi_j P_{ji} = 0, & \\forall i,j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\} \\\\ \\sum_{j=1}^{n} P_{ij} = 1, & \\forall i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\} \\\\ P_{ij} \\ge 0, & \\forall i,j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\} \\end{cases} $$\n\n**3.

We construct the matrix $A_{\\text{eq}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(n + n(n-1)/2) \\times n^2}$ and vector $b_{\\text{eq}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n + n(n-1)/2}$.\n    -   For the $n$ row-sum constraints $\\sum_j P_{ij} = 1$, the corresponding rows in $A_{\\text{eq}}$ have entries equal to $1$ for columns associated with $P_{ij}$ (for a fixed $i$), and the corresponding entry in $b_{\\text{eq}}$ is $1$.\n    -   For the $n(n-1)/2$ independent detailed balance constraints $\\pi_i P_{ij} - \\pi_j P_{ji} = 0$ (for $i<j$), the corresponding rows in $A_{\\text{eq}}$ have an entry $\\pi_i$ at the column for $P_{ij}$ and $-\\pi_j$ at the column for $P_{ji}$. The corresponding entry in $b_{\\text{eq}}$ is $0$.\n-   **Bounds:** The non-negativity constraint $P_{ij} \\ge 0$ is handled by setting a lower bound of $0$ for all variables in $x$. An upper bound of $1$ is also natural and can be applied.\n\nThese components—objective function, gradient, linear constraints, and bounds—are passed to the `SLSQP` solver to find the optimal vectorized kernel $x^*$, which is then reshaped into the final matrix $P^*$. The solution is then verified against the problem's criteria for correctness.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize, Bounds, LinearConstraint\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to define test cases, run the optimization for each,\n    and print the formatted results.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Test suite definition from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        (2, [0.6, 0.4], [[0.9, 0.1], [0.2, 0.8]]),\n        (2, [0.01, 0.99], [[0.7, 0.3], [0.4, 0.6]]),\n        (3, [0.2, 0.5, 0.3], [[0.2, 0.5, 0.3], [0.3, 0.4, 0.3], [0.5, 0.1, 0.4]]),\n        (3, [0.1, 0.3, 0.6], [[0.1, 0.3, 0.6], [0.1, 0.3, 0.6], [0.1, 0.3, 0.6]])\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for n, pi_list, K_list in test_cases:\n        pi = np.array(pi_list)\n        K = np.array(K_list)\n        result_tuple = run_optimization_and_verify(n, pi, K)\n        results.append(result_tuple)\n\n    # Format the final output string to match the problem specification\n    # e.g., [[obj1,True,True,True],[obj2,True,True,True]].\n    # Using str() on a list of lists adds spaces, so we remove them.\n    final_output = str([list(r) for r in results]).replace(\" \", \"\")\n    print(final_output)\n\ndef run_optimization_and_verify(n, pi, K):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the constrained optimization problem for a single test case and verifies the result.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The size of the state space.\n        pi (np.ndarray): The stationary distribution vector.\n        K (np.ndarray): The initial estimated kernel matrix.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the objective value and three boolean verification flags.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_vars = n * n\n\n    # 1.
