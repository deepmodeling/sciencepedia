In particular, address whether a canonical invariant measure exists, whether there is persistent temperature drift in time, and how velocity statistics may depend on interparticle distance.\n\nThen, propose diagnostics that can be implemented in simulations to detect such violations, distinguishing between violations that lead to genuine nonequilibrium steady states and those that merely shift the effective equilibrium temperature. Base all reasoning on first principles: Newton’s laws, properties of Gaussian white noise, and the structure of the Fokker–Planck operator for pairwise stochastic thermostats.

If $w^{D}(r)=[w^{R}(r)]^{2}$ holds but $\\sigma^{2}\\neq 2\\gamma k_{B}T$, then the dynamics admits a canonical invariant distribution at an effective temperature $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}=\\sigma^{2}/(2\\gamma k_{B})$.

            "solution": "The problem statement describes a system of $N$ particles of mass $m$ evolving according to the Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) equations of motion. We are tasked with analyzing the consequences of violating the standard conditions required for the system to sample the canonical Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution, $P_{eq} \\propto \\exp(-H/k_B T)$, where $H = \\sum_{i} \\frac{\\mathbf{p}_{i}^{2}}{2m}+U(\\{\\mathbf{r}_{i}\\})$ and $\\mathbf{p}_i = m\\mathbf{v}_i$. The analysis should be performed in the continuous-time limit, based on the Fokker-Planck equation for the phase-space probability density $P(\\{\\mathbf{r}_i, \\mathbf{p}_i\\}, t)$.\n\nThe time evolution of the probability density $P$ is governed by the Fokker-Planck equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial t} = \\mathcal{L}_{FP} P\n$$\nThe Fokker-Planck operator $\\mathcal{L}_{FP}$ can be decomposed into a conservative part (Liouvillian) and a non-conservative part arising from the dissipative and random forces:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{FP} P = \\{H, P\\} + \\mathcal{L}_{nc} P\n$$\nwhere $\\{H, P\\}$ is the Poisson bracket describing Hamiltonian evolution. The canonical distribution $P_{eq}$ is stationary under the Hamiltonian part, i.e., $\\{H, P_{eq}\\} = 0$. Therefore, for $P_{eq}$ to be an invariant measure of the full dynamics, it must also be a null eigenvector of the non-conservative operator, $\\mathcal{L}_{nc} P_{eq} = 0$.\n\nThe non-conservative operator for DPD, which involves pairwise interactions, can be written as a sum over all particle pairs $(i, j)$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{nc} P = \\sum_{ij} \\mathcal{L}_{ij} P\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}_{ij}$ is the operator corresponding to the interaction between particles $i$ and $j$. This operator acts on the momentum coordinates and is given by:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{ij} P = (\\nabla_{\\mathbf{p}_i} - \\nabla_{\\mathbf{p}_j}) \\cdot \\left[ -\\mathbf{F}_{ij}^D P + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{D}_{ij} \\cdot (\\nabla_{\\mathbf{p}_i} - \\nabla_{\\mathbf{p}_j}) P \\right]\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{F}_{ij}^D$ is the dissipative force, and $\\mathbf{D}_{ij}$ is the diffusion tensor for the pair, derived from the correlations of the random forces. The forces are:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{ij}^D = -\\gamma\\, w^{D}(r_{ij})\\left[(\\mathbf{v}_{i}-\\mathbf{v}_{j})\\cdot \\mathbf{e}_{ij}\\right]\\mathbf{e}_{ij}\n$$\nThe random force on particle $i$ due to $j$ is $\\mathbf{F}_{ij}^R = \\sigma\\, w^{R}(r_{ij})\\, \\xi_{ij}(t)\\, \\mathbf{e}_{ij}$. Due to the correlation property of the noise $\\langle \\xi_{ij}(t)\\xi_{kl}(t')\\rangle=\\left(\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl}+\\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk}\\right)\\delta(t-t')$, the diffusion tensor for the relative momentum $\\mathbf{p}_i - \\mathbf{p}_j$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{D}_{ij} = \\sigma^2 [w^R(r_{ij})]^2 \\mathbf{e}_{ij} \\otimes \\mathbf{e}_{ij}\n$$\nFor $P_{eq}$ to be a stationary solution, a sufficient condition is detailed balance, which implies that the phase-space current associated with each pair vanishes. This means the term in the square brackets of the $\\mathcal{L}_{ij}$ operator must be zero for $P = P_{eq}$:\n$$\n-\\mathbf{F}_{ij}^D P_{eq} + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{D}_{ij} \\cdot (\\nabla_{\\mathbf{p}_i} - \\nabla_{\\mathbf{p}_j}) P_{eq} = 0\n$$\nWe use the property that for $P_{eq} \\propto \\exp(-H/k_B T)$, the gradient is $(\\nabla_{\\mathbf{p}_i} - \\nabla_{\\mathbf{p}_j}) P_{eq} = -(\\frac{\\mathbf{p}_i}{m k_B T} - \\frac{\\mathbf{p}_j}{m k_B T}) P_{eq} = -\\frac{\\mathbf{p}_i - \\mathbf{p}_j}{m k_B T} P_{eq}$. Substituting the expressions for the forces and the diffusion tensor, the condition becomes:\n$$\n\\left( \\gamma w^D(r_{ij})\\frac{(\\mathbf{p}_i-\\mathbf{p}_j) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_{ij}}{m} \\mathbf{e}_{ij} \\right) P_{eq} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 [w^R(r_{ij})]^2 (\\mathbf{e}_{ij}\\otimes\\mathbf{e}_{ij}) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{\\mathbf{p}_i-\\mathbf{p}_j}{mk_BT}\\right) P_{eq} = 0\n$$\nSimplifying the tensor product action $(\\mathbf{e}_{ij}\\otimes\\mathbf{e}_{ij}) \\cdot (\\mathbf{p}_i - \\mathbf{p}_j) = ((\\mathbf{p}_i-\\mathbf{p}_j)\\cdot\\mathbf{e}_{ij})\\mathbf{e}_{ij}$, we get:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\gamma w^D(r_{ij})}{m} - \\frac{\\sigma^2 [w^R(r_{ij})]^2}{2mk_BT} \\right) ((\\mathbf{p}_i-\\mathbf{p}_j)\\cdot\\mathbf{e}_{ij}) \\mathbf{e}_{ij} P_{eq} = 0\n$$\nSince this must hold for any configuration and momenta, the prefactor must be zero for all $r_{ij}$. This gives the necessary condition:\n$$\n\\gamma w^D(r) = \\frac{\\sigma^2 [w^R(r)]^2}{2 k_B T}\n$$\nFor this single equation to hold for all $r$, two independent conditions must be met:\n1.  The functional forms of the weight functions must be related: $w^D(r) = [w^R(r)]^2$.\n2.  The coefficients must satisfy the fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR): $\\sigma^2 = 2\\gamma k_B T$.\n\nNow, we analyze the consequences of violating each of these conditions.\n\n**Case 1: $w^D(r) = [w^R(r)]^2$ holds, but $\\sigma^2 \\neq 2\\gamma k_B T$.**\nThe general condition $\\gamma w^D(r) = \\frac{\\sigma^2 [w^R(r)]^2}{2 k_B T_{sys}}$ becomes $\\gamma [w^R(r)]^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2 [w^R(r)]^2}{2 k_B T_{sys}}$. This is satisfied for any $r$ if we define an effective temperature $T_{eff}$ such that $\\gamma = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2 k_B T_{eff}}$, or:\n$$\nT_{eff} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\gamma k_B}\n$$\nThis means that while the system does not equilibrate to the target temperature $T$, it does reach a true thermodynamic equilibrium corresponding to a canonical distribution at this effective temperature $T_{eff}$. The stationary distribution is $P_{st} \\propto \\exp(-H/k_B T_{eff})$. This is an equilibrium state, which means detailed balance is satisfied with respect to this new distribution. Consequently, there is no persistent entropy production in this steady state. Any initial \"temperature drift\" is simply the thermalization process of the system relaxing towards its true equilibrium temperature $T_{eff}$.\n\n**Case 2: $\\sigma^2 = 2\\gamma k_B T$ holds, but $w^D(r) \\neq [w^R(r)]^2$.**\nThe general condition $\\gamma w^D(r) = \\frac{\\sigma^2 [w^R(r)]^2}{2 k_B T}$ becomes $\\gamma w^D(r) = \\frac{2\\gamma k_B T [w^R(r)]^2}{2 k_B T}$, which simplifies to $w^D(r) = [w^R(r)]^2$. Since this is violated by assumption, the condition for detailed balance is not met. The failure is a function of the interparticle distance $r$. This means that for any pair of particles, the balance between dissipation and fluctuation is broken, and the extent of this imbalance depends on their separation.\nThe system cannot relax to any canonical equilibrium state. Instead, it will settle into a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS), characterized by persistent, non-zero probability currents in phase space ($\\mathbf{J}_{ij} \\neq 0$). This implies continuous entropy production. The $r$-dependent imbalance between heating (from noise) and cooling (from dissipation) will create spatial heterogeneities in kinetic properties. For example, the distribution of relative velocities, and specifically its variance $\\langle [(\\mathbf{v}_i - \\mathbf{v}_j)\\cdot\\mathbf{e}_{ij}]^2 \\rangle$, is expected to become dependent on the separation $r_{ij}$, deviating from the uniform value of $2k_B T/m$ expected in a simple equilibrium fluid.\n\nWith this foundation, we can evaluate each option.\n\n**A. If $w^{D}(r)=[w^{R}(r)]^{2}$ holds but $\\sigma^{2}\\neq 2\\gamma k_{B}T$, then the dynamics admits a canonical invariant distribution at an effective temperature $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}=\\sigma^{2}/(2\\gamma k_{B})$. There is no persistent entropy production in the continuous-time limit; the apparent “temperature drift” is the relaxation toward $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. A practical diagnostic is to compare the measured kinetic temperature $T_{\\mathrm{kin}}(t)=\\frac{m}{3Nk_{B}}\\sum_{i}\\langle \\mathbf{v}_{i}^{2}\\rangle$ and velocity histograms to the Maxwell–Boltzmann form at $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.**\nThis statement accurately describes our findings for Case 1. The formula for $T_{eff}$ is correct. The interpretation of the system reaching a true equilibrium at this new temperature, with zero steady-state entropy production, is correct. The diagnostic proposal is also appropriate: one verifies that the system properties (kinetic temperature, velocity distribution) match those of a canonical ensemble at $T_{eff}$ rather than the target $T$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. If $\\sigma^{2}=2\\gamma k_{B}T$ holds but $w^{D}(r)\\neq [w^{R}(r)]^{2}$, the canonical Gibbs–Boltzmann distribution at temperature $T$ is not invariant; the stationary state has nonzero phase-space probability current and velocity statistics that depend on $r_{ij}$. Diagnostics include testing detailed balance via forward–backward path probability ratios, measuring a nonzero steady entropy production rate, and detecting $r$-dependent deviations of the relative velocity variance $\\langle[(\\mathbf{v}_{i}-\\mathbf{v}_{j})\\cdot \\mathbf{e}_{ij}]^{2}\\rangle$.**\nThis statement accurately describes our findings for Case 2. The violation leads to a NESS with non-vanishing probability currents. The $r$-dependent nature of the violation naturally leads to $r$-dependent kinetic properties. The proposed diagnostics are all standard and powerful methods for identifying a NESS: non-zero entropy production (measurable via path probabilities) and state-dependent kinetic observables.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Violating either condition affects only discretization error; as the time step $\\Delta t\\to 0$, the system recovers the canonical invariant distribution at the target $T$, with temperature drift vanishing. Therefore, reducing $\\Delta t$ is a sufficient diagnostic and cure.**\nThis is fundamentally incorrect. Our analysis is based on the Fokker-Planck equation, which represents the continuous-time limit ($\\Delta t \\to 0$) of the stochastic dynamics. The violations lead to incorrect stationary behavior of the model itself, not of its numerical implementation. Reducing the time step will make a simulation converge more accurately to the wrong stationary state (a shifted equilibrium or a NESS), not to the target canonical state.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. When $w^{D}(r)\\neq [w^{R}(r)]^{2}$, pairwise momentum conservation is broken, leading to a systematic drift of the center-of-mass velocity. Monitoring the total momentum $\\sum_{i}m\\mathbf{v}_{i}$ is therefore the primary diagnostic.**\nThis is incorrect. The DPD forces are constructed to be pairwise and to obey Newton's third law. For any pair $(i, j)$: $\\mathbf{F}_{ij}^C = -\\mathbf{F}_{ji}^C$, $\\mathbf{F}_{ij}^D = -\\mathbf{F}_{ji}^D$, and $\\mathbf{F}_{ij}^R = -\\mathbf{F}_{ji}^R$ (the last one due to $\\xi_{ij} = \\xi_{ji}$). Therefore, $\\mathbf{F}_{ij}+\\mathbf{F}_{ji}=0$. The total force on the system is $\\sum_i \\mathbf{F}_i = \\sum_{ij} (\\mathbf{F}_{ij} + \\mathbf{F}_{ji}) = 0$. This means total momentum is always conserved, irrespective of the choice of parameters $\\gamma, \\sigma$ or weight functions $w^D, w^R$. The violation of the weight relation has no effect on momentum conservation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Computing the steady-state entropy production rate from the ratio of forward to time-reversed path probabilities offers a robust diagnostic: a nonzero rate indicates violation of detailed balance (e.g., $w^{D}(r)\\neq [w^{R}(r)]^{2}$), whereas in the special case $w^{D}(r)=[w^{R}(r)]^{2}$ with $\\sigma^{2}\\neq 2\\gamma k_{B}T$, the rate is zero because the system equilibrates canonically at $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}=\\sigma^{2}/(2\\gamma k_{B})$.**\nThis statement correctly synthesizes the distinction between the two types of violations. Violating the weight relation breaks detailed balance, leading to a NESS with persistent entropy production ($\\dot{S} > 0$). Violating only the FDR leads to a new equilibrium state at $T_{eff}$. An equilibrium state, by definition, has no net dissipation or entropy production ($\\dot{S} = 0$). Thus, measuring the entropy production rate provides a definitive way to distinguish between a genuine NESS and a simple shift in the equilibrium temperature. The connection to forward-reverse path probabilities is a cornerstone of modern non-equilibrium statistical mechanics (fluctuation theorems).\n**Verdict: Correct.**",

This hinders its ability to move through the fluid, reducing its mean-squared displacement over time and thus **decreasing** the self-diffusion coefficient $D$.\n2.  **Effect on Viscosity ($\\nu$)**: The shear viscosity $\\eta$ (and thus kinematic viscosity $\\nu = \\eta/\\rho$) reflects the fluid's internal resistance to shear flow, which arises from momentum transport between fluid layers. The dissipative force is a primary mechanism for this momentum exchange. A larger $\\gamma$ enhances the strength of momentum-conserving interactions between particles, leading to more efficient momentum transport throughout the fluid. This results in a higher resistance to flow, thereby **increasing** the viscosity $\\nu$.\n\nSince increasing $\\gamma$ causes the numerator $\\nu$ to increase and the denominator $D$ to decrease, the Schmidt number $Sc$ is expected to increase strongly with $\\gamma$. Physically, a higher Schmidt number indicates that momentum transport is much more efficient than mass transport, a key feature of hydrodynamic behavior.\n\nNext, we perform the calculations for each case using the definition $Sc = \\nu / D$.\n\n- **Case A**: $Sc_A = \\frac{0.25}{0.6} \\approx 0.416667$\n- **Case B**: $Sc_B = \\frac{0.8}{0.25} = 3.2$\n- **Case C**: $Sc_C = \\frac{1.5}{0.12} = 12.5$\n- **Case D**: $Sc_D = \\frac{3.0}{0.05} = 60.0$\n- **Case E**: $Sc_E = \\frac{6.2}{0.02} = 310.0$\n- **Case F**: $Sc_F = \\frac{12.0}{0.004} = 3000.0$\n\nThe sequence of Schmidt numbers, rounded to 6 decimal places where necessary, is $[0.416667, 3.2, 12.5, 60.0, 310.0, 3000.0]$.\nTo check if the sequence is strictly increasing, we compare adjacent elements:\n- $0.416667  3.2 \\rightarrow \\text{True}$\n- $3.2  12.5 \\rightarrow \\text{True}$\n- $12.5  60.0 \\rightarrow \\text{True}$\n- $60.0  310.0 \\rightarrow \\text{True}$\n- $310.0  3000.0 \\rightarrow \\text{True}$\nSince all comparisons are true, the sequence is strictly increasing with $\\gamma$, so the boolean flag is $True$.\n\nThe final output combines the list of Schmidt numbers and the boolean flag.",
