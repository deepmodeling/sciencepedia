            "introduction": "The foundation of studying elementary cellular automata lies in their systematic classification. The Wolfram rule number provides a powerful and unambiguous method to define the behavior of a one-dimensional automaton by encoding the outcomes of all possible local neighborhoods into a single integer. This exercise builds this foundational skill by tasking you with translating a descriptive, qualitative model of local interactions into its precise quantitative Wolfram code, a crucial first step toward simulating and exploring the vast space of CA behaviors .",

            "problem": "A systems biologist is developing a simplified one-dimensional model to study the dynamics of gene expression in a line of adjacent cells. The state of each cell is binary: `1` represents an \"expressed\" gene, and `0` represents a \"repressed\" gene. The state of a cell at the next time step is determined by its current state and the states of its immediate left and right neighbors. This collection of three cells (left, center, right) is called the neighborhood.\n\nThe system updates according to the following set of local rules:\n*   If a cell and both its neighbors are expressed (`111`), the central cell becomes repressed in the next step due to resource competition.\n*   If a central cell has two expressed neighbors but is itself repressed (`101`), it becomes expressed in the next step due to strong external signals.\n*   If a central cell is expressed and has exactly one expressed neighbor (either `110` or `011`), it remains expressed.\n*   If a central cell is expressed but both of its neighbors are repressed (`010`), it becomes repressed due to lack of support.\n*   In all other cases, the central cell will be in a repressed state (`0`) in the next time step.\n\nThe behavior of such a system can be described by an integer known as the Wolfram rule number. This number is the decimal representation of an 8-bit binary string. The binary string is constructed by listing the outcomes (the next state of the central cell) for all eight possible neighborhood configurations. The outcomes are ordered according to the neighborhood's value when treated as a 3-bit binary number, from largest (`111`) to smallest (`000`).\n\nCalculate the Wolfram rule number that describes this model of gene regulation.",
            "solution": "We enumerate all eight neighborhoods from largest to smallest, $111,110,101,100,011,010,001,000$, and determine the next state of the central cell using the given rules.\n\n- For $111$: by the first rule, the central cell becomes repressed, so output $0$.\n- For $110$: the central cell is expressed with exactly one expressed neighbor, so it remains expressed, output $1$.\n- For $101$: the central cell is repressed with two expressed neighbors, so it becomes expressed, output $1$.\n- For $100$: no special rule applies, so by the last rule the output is $0$.\n- For $011$: the central cell is expressed with exactly one expressed neighbor, so it remains expressed, output $1$.\n- For $010$: the central cell is expressed with both neighbors repressed, so it becomes repressed, output $0$.\n- For $001$: no special rule applies, so by the last rule the output is $0$.\n- For $000$: no special rule applies, so by the last rule the output is $0$.\n\nThus the ordered output bits from $111$ to $000$ are $0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0$, giving the 8-bit binary string $01101000$.\n\nInterpreting this as a binary number, its decimal value is\n$$0\\cdot 2^{7}+1\\cdot 2^{6}+1\\cdot 2^{5}+0\\cdot 2^{4}+1\\cdot 2^{3}+0\\cdot 2^{2}+0\\cdot 2^{1}+0\\cdot 2^{0}=64+32+8=104.$$\n\nTherefore, the Wolfram rule number is $104$.",

            "introduction": "Beyond static classification, the true power of cellular automata is revealed in their dynamics, where simple local rules can generate profound, large-scale patterns. The famous Rule 90, for example, exhibits deep connections to number theory, as its evolution from a single active cell generates a fractal pattern identical to Pascal's triangle evaluated modulo $2$. This practice challenges you to derive and quantify this emergent behavior, connecting the discrete, local updates of a CA to the global structure of binomial coefficients, demonstrating how complexity arises from decentralized systems .",

            "problem": "An elementary cellular automaton consists of a one-dimensional grid of cells, indexed by integers, where each cell can be in one of two states: 0 (off) or 1 (on). The system evolves in discrete time steps. The state of a cell at position $i$ at time $t+1$, denoted $S_{t+1}(i)$, is determined by the states of specific cells at time $t$.\n\nFor this particular automaton, the update rule is given by the sum modulo 2 of the states of the cell at position $i-1$ and the cell at position $i+1$ at the previous time step. That is:\n$$S_{t+1}(i) = [S_t(i-1) + S_t(i+1)] \\pmod 2$$\nNote that a cell's own state at time $t$ does not directly influence its state at $t+1$.\n\nThe automaton starts at time $t=0$ with a single cell at position $i=0$ in state 1, and all other cells are in state 0.\n\nCalculate the total number of cells in state 1 across the entire grid at time $t=99$.",
            "solution": "We consider the elementary cellular automaton with update rule\n$$\nS_{t+1}(i) = \\left[S_{t}(i-1) + S_{t}(i+1)\\right] \\bmod 2,\n$$\nand initial condition $S_{0}(0)=1$ with $S_{0}(i)=0$ for all $i \\neq 0$. Because updates only use neighbors, after $t$ steps only positions $i$ with $|i| \\le t$ and with $t+i$ even can be nonzero. \n\nWe claim the explicit formula\n$$\nS_{t}(i) \\equiv \\binom{t}{\\frac{t+i}{2}} \\pmod{2} \\quad \\text{for } t+i \\text{ even, and } S_{t}(i)=0 \\text{ otherwise}.\n$$\nThis is proved by induction on $t$. For $t=0$, only $i=0$ satisfies $t+i$ even, and $\\binom{0}{0}=1$, matching $S_{0}(0)=1$ and $S_{0}(i)=0$ otherwise. Assume it holds for time $t$. For time $t+1$ and any $i$, set $m=\\frac{t+1+i}{2}$. Then\n$$\nS_{t+1}(i) \\equiv S_{t}(i-1) + S_{t}(i+1) \\pmod{2}.\n$$\nIf $t+1+i$ is odd, then both $t+(i-1)$ and $t+(i+1)$ are odd, so by the induction hypothesis both terms are zero and $S_{t+1}(i)=0$, consistent with the claim. If $t+1+i$ is even, then $t+(i-1)=2(m-1)$ and $t+(i+1)=2m$, so by the induction hypothesis,\n$$\nS_{t}(i-1) \\equiv \\binom{t}{m-1} \\pmod{2}, \\qquad S_{t}(i+1) \\equiv \\binom{t}{m} \\pmod{2}.\n$$\nHence, using Pascal's identity,\n$$\nS_{t+1}(i) \\equiv \\binom{t}{m-1} + \\binom{t}{m} \\equiv \\binom{t+1}{m} \\pmod{2},\n$$\nwhich is exactly the claimed form with $m=\\frac{t+1+i}{2}$. This completes the induction, so the formula holds for all $t$.\n\nTherefore, the number of cells in state $1$ at time $t$ equals the number of odd binomial coefficients in row $t$ of Pascal's triangle, that is, the number of $k$ with $0 \\le k \\le t$ such that $\\binom{t}{k}$ is odd. By Lucas's theorem, $\\binom{t}{k}$ is odd if and only if, in binary, each $1$-bit of $k$ occurs only where $t$ also has a $1$-bit. Thus the number of such $k$ equals $2^{s_{2}(t)}$, where $s_{2}(t)$ is the number of $1$-bits in the binary expansion of $t$.\n\nFor $t=99$, write $99=64+32+2+1$, so in binary $99$ has $4$ ones. Hence $s_{2}(99)=4$, and the total number of ones at time $t=99$ is\n$$\n2^{s_{2}(99)} = 2^{4} = 16.\n$$",

            "introduction": "Cellular automata serve as powerful tools for modeling real-world phenomena, from fluid dynamics to traffic flow. Rule 184 offers a minimalist yet insightful model of single-lane traffic, where particles (cars) move based on the availability of adjacent space. By analyzing the conditions required for a fixed point—a \"total gridlock\" where no particle can move—we can deduce fundamental constraints on the system's behavior. This thought experiment requires you to prove that under this model's rules, a finite, non-empty traffic jam is dynamically impossible, illustrating how CA analysis can reveal the inherent limitations and long-term tendencies of the systems they represent .",

The road is divided into discrete sites, indexed by integers. Each site can either be empty (state 0) or occupied by a car (state 1). The system evolves in discrete time steps.\n\nThe rule for updating the state of the system, known as Rule 184, is as follows:\n- A car at site `i` at time `t` will move one site to the right (to site `i+1`) at time `t+1` if and only if site `i+1` is empty at time `t`.\n- If a car at site `i` at time `t` cannot move because site `i+1` is occupied, it remains at site `i` at time `t+1`.\n- An empty site `i` at time `t` becomes occupied at time `t+1` if and only if a car from site `i-1` moves into it.\n\nA \"finite configuration\" is a state of the road where only a finite number of sites are occupied by cars.

Under Rule 184, a car at site $i$ moves to site $i+1$ at the next time step if and only if $x_{i}(t)=1$ and $x_{i+1}(t)=0$. A configuration is a fixed point (total gridlock) if and only if no car can move, which is equivalent to the absence of the local pattern $(x_{i}(t),x_{i+1}(t))=(1,0)$ for every $i$.

Therefore any fixed point either has no $1$ anywhere (the all-zero configuration), or has an infinite tail of $1$'s to the right.\n\nA finite configuration is defined to have only finitely many $1$'s, with $x_{i}(t)=0$ for all sufficiently large $|i|$. This rules out an infinite tail of $1$'s. Consequently, the only finite fixed point is the empty configuration with $x_{i}(t)=0$ for all $i$, which is not among the non-empty options.\n\nChecking the given non-empty examples:\n- A: $1$ has $(1,0)$ at its right boundary, so the car moves; not fixed.\n- B: $11$ has the rightmost $1$ followed by $0$, so it moves; not fixed.\n- C: $101$ contains $(1,0)$ twice; both cars move; not fixed.\n\nThus, no non-empty, finite configuration is a fixed point.\n\nTherefore the correct choice is D.",
