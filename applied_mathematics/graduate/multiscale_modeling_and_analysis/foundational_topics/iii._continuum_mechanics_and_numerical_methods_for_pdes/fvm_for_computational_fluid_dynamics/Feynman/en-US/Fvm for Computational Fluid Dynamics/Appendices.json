So, $b = u_{\\Gamma}$.\n\nThe derivative of $u$ with respect to $x$ is constant for a linear profile:\n$$\\frac{du}{dx} = a$$\nThe problem specifies a Neumann boundary condition at the face $\\Gamma$ ($x=0$), which prescribes the normal derivative:\n$$\\left. \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial n} \\right|_{\\Gamma} = \\left. \\frac{du}{dx} \\right|_{x=0} = g$$\nTherefore, the slope of our linear profile is $a = g$. The linear profile is now given by:\n$$u(x) = gx + u_{\\Gamma}$$\n\nTo find the unknown boundary face value $u_{\\Gamma}$, we use the known value $u_P$ at the location $x_P = -d_P$:\n$$u_P = u(x_P) = u(-d_P) = g(-d_P) + u_{\\Gamma} = -gd_P + u_{\\Gamma}$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for $u_{\\Gamma}$ gives:\n$$u_{\\Gamma} = u_P + gd_P$$\nThis expression provides a second-order accurate extrapolation for the value of the scalar field at the boundary face.\n\nNow, we use the same linear profile to determine the value at the ghost cell center, $u_G$, located at $x_G = d_G$:\n$$u_G = u(x_G) = u(d_G) = gd_G + u_{\\Gamma}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $u_{\\Gamma}$ into this equation yields:\n$$u_G = gd_G + (u_P + gd_P)$$\n$$u_G = u_P + g(d_P + d_G)$$\nThis is the general formula for the ghost cell value $u_G$ under the assumption of a linear profile, used to enforce the Neumann condition $\\partial_n u = g$. This result is equivalent to using a second-order central difference approximation for the derivative, $\\frac{u_G - u_P}{d_G - (-d_P)} = \\frac{u_G - u_P}{d_P + d_G}$, and setting it equal to the constant derivative $g$.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $u_P = 1.35$\n- $d_P = 7.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$\n- $d_G = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\text{m}$\n- $g = -25\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, calculate the total distance between the cell centers $P$ and $G$:\n$$d_P + d_G = (7.5 \\times 10^{-3}) \\, \\text{m} + (1.0 \\times 10^{-2}) \\, \\text{m} = 0.0075 \\, \\text{m} + 0.01 \\, \\text{m} = 0.0175 \\, \\text{m}$$\n\nNext, substitute the values into the derived formula for $u_G$:\n$$u_G = u_P + g(d_P + d_G)$$\n$$u_G = 1.35 + (-25 \\, \\text{m}^{-1}) \\times (0.0175 \\, \\text{m})$$\nThe product $g(d_P + d_G)$ is:\n$$(-25) \\times 0.0175 = -0.4375$$\nThis term is dimensionless, as expected.\n\nNow, compute the final value for $u_G$:\n$$u_G = 1.35 + (-0.4375) = 1.35 - 0.4375 = 0.9125$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.9125$ already has exactly four significant figures, so no further rounding is necessary.",
