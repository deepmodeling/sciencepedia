The mapping $T$ is defined as\n$$\n(Tu)(t)=S(t)u_{0}+\\int_{0}^{t}S(t-s)\\,g(u(s))\\,ds\n$$\nWe begin by forming the difference $(Tu)(t) - (Tv)(t)$:\n$$\n(Tu)(t) - (Tv)(t) = \\left(S(t)u_{0}+\\int_{0}^{t}S(t-s)\\,g(u(s))\\,ds\\right) - \\left(S(t)u_{0}+\\int_{0}^{t}S(t-s)\\,g(v(s))\\,ds\\right)\n$$\nThe terms involving the initial data $u_{0}$ cancel. Using the linearity of the integral, we combine the two integral terms:\n$$\n(Tu)(t) - (Tv)(t) = \\int_{0}^{t}S(t-s)\\,[g(u(s)) - g(v(s))]\\,ds\n$$\nNext, we compute the $L^{2}(\\Omega)$ norm of this difference for a fixed $t\\ge 0$.\n$$\n\\|(Tu)(t) - (Tv)(t)\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)} = \\left\\|\\int_{0}^{t}S(t-s)\\,[g(u(s)) - g(v(s))]\\,ds\\right\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}\n$$\nWe apply the triangle inequality for Bochner integrals (also known as the Minkowski inequality for integrals), which states that the norm of an integral is less than or equal to the integral of the norm:\n$$\n\\|(Tu)(t) - (Tv)(t)\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)} \\le \\int_{0}^{t}\\left\\|S(t-s)\\,[g(u(s)) - g(v(s))]\\right\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}\\,ds\n$$\nNow, we use the operator norm of the semigroup $S(t-s)$ which maps $L^{2}(\\Omega)$ to $L^{2}(\\Omega)$.

Let the discontinuity be located at $x = s t$, with constant states $u_{L}$ for $x < s t$ and $u_{R}$ for $x > s t$. Consider a small interval $(x_{1}(t), x_{2}(t))$ with $x_{1}(t) < s t < x_{2}(t)$ moving with the discontinuity such that the interval shrinks to the discontinuity in the limit. The integral conservation over $(x_{1}(t), x_{2}(t))$ reads\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\int_{x_{1}(t)}^{x_{2}(t)} u(x,t)\\,\\mathrm{d}x \\;=\\; f\\big(u(x_{1}(t),t)\\big) - f\\big(u(x_{2}(t),t)\\big).\n$$\nUsing Leibniz’s rule for a moving interval, we obtain\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\int_{x_{1}(t)}^{x_{2}(t)} u\\,\\mathrm{d}x \\;=\\; \\int_{x_{1}(t)}^{x_{2}(t)} u_{t}\\,\\mathrm{d}x \\;+\\; u(x_{2}(t),t)\\,x_{2}'(t) \\;-\\; u(x_{1}(t),t)\\,x_{1}'(t).\n$$\nAs the interval collapses to the discontinuity and $x_{1}'(t) = x_{2}'(t) = s$, the integral term vanishes and we obtain the jump relation\n$$\ns\\,\\big(u_{R} - u_{L}\\big) \\;=\\; f(u_{R}) - f(u_{L}).\n$$\nThis is the Rankine–Hugoniot condition, usually written as\n$$\ns \\;=\\; \\frac{f(u_{R}) - f(u_{L})}{u_{R} - u_{L}}.\n$$\n\nTo assess entropy admissibility and well-posedness, we employ an entropy–entropy flux pair $(\\eta,q)$, where $\\eta$ is a convex function and $q$ satisfies\n$$\nq'(u) \\;=\\; \\eta'(u)\\,f'(u).\n$$\nFor smooth solutions, $\\eta(u)$ obeys the balance law $\\partial_{t}\\eta(u) + \\partial_{x} q(u) = 0$. For weak solutions with shocks, the entropy inequality\n$$\n\\partial_{t}\\eta(u) + \\partial_{x} q(u) \\leq 0\n$$\nmust hold in the sense of distributions. Integrating across the moving discontinuity yields the entropy jump condition\n$$\ns\\,[\\eta(u)] - [q(u)] \\;\\leq\\; 0,\n$$\nwhere $[\\phi] := \\phi(u_{R}) - \\phi(u_{L})$ denotes the jump of any function $\\phi$ across the discontinuity. The entropy residual is defined as\n$$\nD \\;:=\\; s\\,[\\eta(u)] - [q(u)].\n$$\nAn admissible shock must satisfy $D \\leq 0$ for every convex entropy.\n\nWe now apply these formulas to the specific flux $f(u) = u^{3} - 3u$ and states $u_{L} = 2$, $u_{R} = -1$.\n\nFirst, compute the Rankine–Hugoniot speed:\n$$\nf(u_{L}) \\;=\\; f(2) \\;=\\; 2^{3} - 3\\cdot 2 \\;=\\; 8 - 6 \\;=\\; 2,\n$$\n$$\nf(u_{R}) \\;=\\; f(-1) \\;=\\; (-1)^{3} - 3\\cdot(-1) \\;=\\; -1 + 3 \\;=\\; 2.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\ns \\;=\\; \\frac{f(u_{R}) - f(u_{L})}{u_{R} - u_{L}} \\;=\\; \\frac{2 - 2}{-1 - 2} \\;=\\; 0.\n$$\n\nNext, use the quadratic entropy $\\eta(u) = \\tfrac{1}{2} u^{2}$, so $\\eta'(u) = u$. The associated entropy flux is determined by\n$$\nq'(u) \\;=\\; \\eta'(u)\\,f'(u) \\;=\\; u\\,f'(u),\n$$\nwhere\n$$\nf'(u) \\;=\\; 3u^{2} - 3.\n$$\nHence\n$$\nq'(u) \\;=\\; u\\,(3u^{2} - 3) \\;=\\; 3u^{3} - 3u,\n$$\nand integrating with respect to $u$ gives\n$$\nq(u) \\;=\\; \\int (3u^{3} - 3u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u \\;=\\; \\frac{3}{4} u^{4} - \\frac{3}{2} u^{2} \\;+\\; C,\n$$\nwhere the constant $C$ is irrelevant for jump computations, so we take\n$$\nq(u) \\;=\\; \\frac{3}{4} u^{4} - \\frac{3}{2} u^{2}.\n$$\n\nCompute the jumps:\n$$\n[\\eta(u)] \\;=\\; \\eta(u_{R}) - \\eta(u_{L}) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2}(-1)^{2} - \\frac{1}{2}(2)^{2} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2} - 2 \\;=\\; -\\frac{3}{2},\n$$\n$$\nq(u_{R}) \\;=\\; \\frac{3}{4}(-1)^{4} - \\frac{3}{2}(-1)^{2} \\;=\\; \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{3}{2} \\;=\\; -\\frac{3}{4},\n$$\n$$\nq(u_{L}) \\;=\\; \\frac{3}{4}(2)^{4} - \\frac{3}{2}(2)^{2} \\;=\\; \\frac{3}{4}\\cdot 16 - \\frac{3}{2}\\cdot 4 \\;=\\; 12 - 6 \\;=\\; 6,\n$$\nso\n$$\n[q(u)] \\;=\\; q(u_{R}) - q(u_{L}) \\;=\\; -\\frac{3}{4} - 6 \\;=\\; -\\frac{27}{4}.\n$$\n\nFinally, compute the entropy residual:\n$$\nD \\;=\\; s\\,[\\eta(u)] - [q(u)] \\;=\\; 0\\cdot\\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{27}{4}\\right) \\;=\\; \\frac{27}{4}.\n$$\n\nThe Rankine–Hugoniot speed is $s = 0$, and the entropy residual for the quadratic entropy is $D = \\tfrac{27}{4}$. Because $D > 0$, this discontinuity is not entropy-admissible for the chosen entropy, signaling a violation of the entropy condition and thus a failure of well-posedness for this shock connection in the effective flux model. The requested final output is the pair $\\big(s, D\\big)$.",
