            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional homogenized macroscopic field $u(x)$ arising from a multiscale elliptic model in which microscale variations have been averaged out. Let $u$ be $C^{6}$-smooth on an interval and sampled on a uniform grid with spacing $h>0$.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It poses a standard, verifiable question in numerical analysis and connects it soundly to the field of multiscale modeling. All necessary information is provided, and the problem is free of contradictions or ambiguities. Thus, the problem is valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe local truncation error, denoted by $\\tau(x)$, is defined as the difference between the discrete finite difference operator applied to the exact, smooth function $u(x)$ and the continuous differential operator it is intended to approximate. For the given three-point central difference operator $D_{h}^{2}u(x)$ approximating the second derivative $u''(x) \\equiv \\frac{d^2u}{dx^2}$, the truncation error is:\n$$ \\tau(x) = D_{h}^{2}u(x) - u''(x) $$\nSubstituting the definition of the operator, we have:\n$$ \\tau(x) = \\frac{u(x+h) - 2u(x) + u(x-h)}{h^{2}} - u''(x) $$\nTo analyze this expression, we use Taylor's theorem to expand the terms $u(x+h)$ and $u(x-h)$ around the point $x$. The problem specifies that the function $u$ is $C^{6}$-smooth, which permits Taylor expansion with sufficient terms to determine the error up to order $h^{4}$. The expansions are:\n$$ u(x+h) = u(x) + u'(x)h + \\frac{u''(x)}{2!}h^{2} + \\frac{u'''(x)}{3!}h^{3} + \\frac{u^{(4)}(x)}{4!}h^{4} + \\frac{u^{(5)}(x)}{5!}h^{5} + \\frac{u^{(6)}(x)}{6!}h^{6} + O(h^{7}) $$\n$$ u(x-h) = u(x) - u'(x)h + \\frac{u''(x)}{2!}h^{2} - \\frac{u'''(x)}{3!}h^{3} + \\frac{u^{(4)}(x)}{4!}h^{4} - \\frac{u^{(5)}(x)}{5!}h^{5} + \\frac{u^{(6)}(x)}{6!}h^{6} + O(h^{7}) $$\nHere, $u^{(n)}(x)$ denotes the $n$-th derivative of $u$ at $x$.\n\nWe substitute these expansions into the numerator of the expression for $D_{h}^{2}u(x)$:\n$$ u(x+h) - 2u(x) + u(x-h) = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\frac{u^{(k)}(x)}{k!}h^{k} \\right) - 2u(x) + \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\frac{u^{(k)}(x)}{k!}(-h)^{k} \\right) + O(h^{7}) $$\nCombining the terms from the two series, we observe a cancellation pattern. For terms with an odd index $k$, we have $h^{k} + (-h)^{k} = h^{k} - h^{k} = 0$. For terms with an even index $k$, we have $h^{k} + (-h)^{k} = h^{k} + h^{k} = 2h^{k}$. Let's write out the sum explicitly:\n$$ u(x+h) + u(x-h) = 2u(x) + 2\\frac{u''(x)}{2!}h^{2} + 2\\frac{u^{(4)}(x)}{4!}h^{4} + 2\\frac{u^{(6)}(x)}{6!}h^{6} + O(h^{8}) $$\nSubtracting the $2u(x)$ term gives the full numerator:\n$$ u(x+h) - 2u(x) + u(x-h) = 2\\frac{u''(x)}{2!}h^{2} + 2\\frac{u^{(4)}(x)}{4!}h^{4} + 2\\frac{u^{(6)}(x)}{6!}h^{6} + O(h^{8}) $$\nSubstituting the factorial values ($2! = 2$, $4! = 24$, $6! = 720$):\n$$ u(x+h) - 2u(x) + u(x-h) = u''(x)h^{2} + \\frac{2}{24}u^{(4)}(x)h^{4} + \\frac{2}{720}u^{(6)}(x)h^{6} + O(h^{8}) $$\n$$ u(x+h) - 2u(x) + u(x-h) = u''(x)h^{2} + \\frac{1}{12}u^{(4)}(x)h^{4} + \\frac{1}{360}u^{(6)}(x)h^{6} + O(h^{8}) $$\nNow, we can write the full expression for $D_{h}^{2}u(x)$ by dividing by $h^{2}$:\n$$ D_{h}^{2}u(x) = \\frac{1}{h^{2}} \\left( u''(x)h^{2} + \\frac{1}{12}u^{(4)}(x)h^{4} + \\frac{1}{360}u^{(6)}(x)h^{6} + O(h^{8}) \\right) $$\n$$ D_{h}^{2}u(x) = u''(x) + \\frac{1}{12}u^{(4)}(x)h^{2} + \\frac{1}{360}u^{(6)}(x)h^{4} + O(h^{6}) $$\nFinally, we compute the truncation error $\\tau(x)$ by subtracting $u''(x)$:\n$$ \\tau(x) = D_{h}^{2}u(x) - u''(x) = \\left( u''(x) + \\frac{1}{12}u^{(4)}(x)h^{2} + \\frac{1}{360}u^{(6)}(x)h^{4} + O(h^{6}) \\right) - u''(x) $$\nThe problem asks for the expression through terms of order $h^{4}$. We therefore truncate the series after the $h^4$ term:\n$$ \\tau(x) = \\frac{1}{12}u^{(4)}(x)h^{2} + \\frac{1}{360}u^{(6)}(x)h^{4} $$\nIt is often conventional to write this with the powers of $h$ grouped:\n$$ \\tau(x) = \\frac{h^{2}}{12}u^{(4)}(x) + \\frac{h^{4}}{360}u^{(6)}(x) $$\n\nThe reason odd derivatives do not appear in the final expression is due to the symmetry of the central difference stencil. The stencil coefficients for $D_h^2u(x)$ are proportional to $(1, -2, 1)$, centered at $x$. The evaluation points are $x-h$ and $x+h$, which are symmetric with respect to $x$. When the Taylor series for $u(x+h)$ and $u(x-h)$ are combined in the expression $u(x+h) + u(x-h)$, the terms containing odd powers of $h$, such as $u'(x)h$ and $u'''(x)h^3/6$, have opposite signs and cancel exactly. These terms correspond to the odd derivatives of $u(x)$. This cancellation happens for all odd-order terms, leading to an error series that contains only even powers of $h$.\n\nIn the context of multiscale modeling and analysis, this symmetry is a crucial property. The process of homogenization or upscaling averages out microscale details to produce a macroscopic model. It is often a fundamental requirement that this process preserves the essential physical symmetries of the underlying microscopic system. For instance, if the microscale physics is invariant under spatial reflection (parity), the resulting macroscopic continuum model and its numerical discretization should also respect this symmetry. A non-symmetric stencil, such as a forward difference $\\frac{u(x+h)-u(x)}{h}$, would introduce an artificial directionality, breaking the reflection symmetry. This broken symmetry would manifest as a leading-order error term involving an odd derivative (e.g., proportional to $u''(x)h$ for the forward difference approximation of $u'(x)$), which is not invariant under the transformation $h \\to -h$. The use of a symmetric central difference scheme ensures that the numerical method does not introduce spurious asymmetries into the model. This preserves the integrity of the scale separation, ensuring that the computed macroscopic behavior is a genuine consequence of the upscaled physics and not an artifact of a biased numerical discretization. This principle is vital for the fidelity of multiscale simulations.",

This is common for numerical schemes based on centered differences. In this scenario, all odd-indexed coefficients $c_k$ are zero, i.e., $c_3 = c_5 = c_7 = \\cdots = 0$.\nThe error expansion for $\\widehat{Q}$ becomes:\n$$\n\\widehat{Q} - Q = c_{4}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{16} + \\beta\\right)h^{4} + c_{6}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{64} + \\beta\\right)h^{6} + \\cdots\n$$\nThe leading error term is now the $h^4$ term. We compute its coefficient:\n$$\n\\text{Coeff}(h^{4}) = c_{4}\\left(\\frac{1}{16}\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right) - \\frac{1}{3}\\right) = c_{4}\\left(\\frac{1}{12} - \\frac{1}{3}\\right) = c_{4}\\left(\\frac{1}{12} - \\frac{4}{12}\\right) = -\\frac{3c_{4}}{12} = -\\frac{c_{4}}{4}\n$$\nIn this special case, the leading term of the truncation error for $\\widehat{Q}$ is $-\\frac{c_{4}}{4}h^4$. The order of the approximation $\\widehat{Q}$ is therefore $4$.\n\nThe problem asks for the single closed-form analytic expression for $\\widehat{Q}$ in terms of $Q_{h/2}$ and $Q_h$. Based on our derived coefficients, this expression is:\n$$\n\\widehat{Q} = \\frac{4}{3}Q_{h/2} - \\frac{1}{3}Q_{h}\n$$",
            "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{4}{3} Q_{h/2} - \\frac{1}{3} Q_{h}}\n$$"
