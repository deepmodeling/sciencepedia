The type of the PDE (elliptic, hyperbolic, or parabolic) corresponds to the signature of this quadratic form. This signature is determined by the sign of the discriminant, defined as $\\Delta(x,y) = B(x,y)^2 - A(x,y)C(x,y)$.\n\nThe classification rules are as follows:\n1.  The PDE is **elliptic** at a point $(x,y)$ if $\\Delta(x,y)  0$. This corresponds to the quadratic form being positive-definite or negative-definite.\n2.

Since the value $-\\delta$ is within the range of the cosine function, real solutions for $x$ exist.\n\nWe are asked for the smallest positive location $x_{\\ast}$ in the strip $x \\in [0, \\pi\\epsilon]$ where a transition occurs. Let us define a new variable $z = x/\\epsilon$. The domain for $z$ is $[0, \\pi]$. The equation for the transition points becomes:\n$$ \\cos(z) = -\\delta. $$\nThe principal value solution for this equation is given by the arccosine function, $z = \\arccos(-\\delta)$. The range of the arccosine function is $[0, \\pi]$. Given that $-1  -\\delta  0$, the principal value lies in the open interval $(\\pi/2, \\pi)$. Specifically, $z = \\arccos(-\\delta)$ is the only solution to $\\cos(z)=-\\delta$ in the interval $[0, \\pi]$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive value of $z$ that satisfies the condition is $z_{\\ast} = \\arccos(-\\delta)$.\nThis corresponds to the location $x_{\\ast}$ given by:\n$$ x_{\\ast} = \\epsilon z_{\\ast} = \\epsilon \\arccos(-\\delta). $$\nSince $\\pi/2  \\arccos(-\\delta)  \\pi$, we have $\\pi\\epsilon/2  x_{\\ast}  \\pi\\epsilon$. This confirms that $x_{\\ast}$ is within the specified domain $[0, \\pi\\epsilon]$ and is positive.\n\nWe must verify that the transition at $x_{\\ast}$ is from elliptic to hyperbolic.\n- At $x=0$, we have $A(0) = \\cos(0) + \\delta = 1+\\delta$. Since $\\delta  0$, $A(0)  0$. The discriminant is $\\Delta(0) = -A(0) = -(1+\\delta)  0$, so the PDE is elliptic at the beginning of the strip.\n- For $x$ in the interval $[0, x_{\\ast})$, we have $x/\\epsilon  \\arccos(-\\delta)$. Since $z = x/\\epsilon$ is in the interval $[0, \\pi]$, where the cosine function is monotonically decreasing, it follows that $\\cos(x/\\epsilon)  \\cos(\\arccos(-\\delta)) = -\\delta$. This implies $\\cos(x/\\epsilon) + \\delta  0$, so $\\Delta(x)  0$. Thus, the PDE is elliptic for $x \\in [0, x_{\\ast})$.\n- For $x$ in the interval $(x_{\\ast}, \\pi\\epsilon]$, we have $x/\\epsilon  \\arccos(-\\delta)$. Again, due to the decreasing nature of cosine on $[0, \\pi]$, we have $\\cos(x/\\epsilon)  \\cos(\\arccos(-\\delta)) = -\\delta$. This implies $\\cos(x/\\epsilon) + \\delta  0$, so $\\Delta(x)  0$. Thus, the PDE is hyperbolic for $x \\in (x_{\\ast}, \\pi\\epsilon]$.\n\nThe point $x_{\\ast} = \\epsilon \\arccos(-\\delta)$ is therefore the smallest positive location in the domain where the PDE transitions from elliptic to hyperbolic type. The expression is in closed form as requested. An alternative but equivalent form is $x_{\\ast} = \\epsilon (\\pi - \\arccos(\\delta))$.",

The classification depends on the sign of the discriminant $\\Delta = (2B)^2 - 4AC = 4(B^2-AC)$. The term $B^2-AC$ is the negative of the determinant of $M$, $\\det(M) = AC-B^2$. The determinant is also the product of the eigenvalues, $\\det(M) = \\lambda_1 \\lambda_2$.\nThe classification rules are:\n- Elliptic: $B^2 - AC  0 \\iff AC - B^2  0 \\iff \\det(M)  0$. This implies $\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2  0$, so the eigenvalues have the same sign.\n- Parabolic: $B^2 - AC = 0 \\iff AC - B^2 = 0 \\iff \\det(M) = 0$. This implies $\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 = 0$, so at least one eigenvalue is zero.\n- Hyperbolic: $B^2 - AC  0 \\iff AC - B^2  0 \\iff \\det(M)  0$. This implies $\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2  0$, so the eigenvalues have opposite signs.\nSince the given problem states $A0$ and $C0$, the trace of $M$, $\\text{tr}(M) = A+C = \\lambda_1+\\lambda_2$, is always positive. Thus, for the elliptic case, both eigenvalues must be positive.\n\nNow, we apply this to the specific coefficients given:\n$$ A(\\alpha) = 4 + \\alpha^{2}, \\qquad B(\\alpha) = \\alpha, \\qquad C(\\alpha) = 1 + \\alpha^{2} $$\nWe compute the discriminant term $B^2 - AC$:\n$$ B(\\alpha)^2 - A(\\alpha)C(\\alpha) = \\alpha^2 - (4 + \\alpha^2)(1 + \\alpha^2) $$\n$$ = \\alpha^2 - (4 + 4\\alpha^2 + \\alpha^2 + \\alpha^4) $$\n$$ = \\alpha^2 - (4 + 5\\alpha^2 + \\alpha^4) $$\n$$ = -\\alpha^4 - 4\\alpha^2 - 4 = -(\\alpha^4 + 4\\alpha^2 + 4) $$\n$$ = -(\\alpha^2 + 2)^2 $$\nFor any $\\alpha  0$, the term $\\alpha^2$ is positive. Thus, $\\alpha^2 + 2$ is always a positive real number greater than $2$. Its square, $(\\alpha^2 + 2)^2$, is strictly positive. Therefore, for all $\\alpha  0$, we have:\n$$ B^2 - AC = -(\\alpha^2 + 2)^2  0 $$\nSince the discriminant is always negative, the PDE is **elliptic** for all $\\alpha  0$.\n\nFinally, we derive the explicit closed-form expression for the rotation angle $\\theta(\\alpha)$. We use the formula derived earlier:\n$$ \\tan(2\\theta) = \\frac{2B}{A-C} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $A, B, C$ in terms of $\\alpha$:\n$$ A-C = (4 + \\alpha^2) - (1 + \\alpha^2) = 3 $$\n$$ 2B = 2\\alpha $$\nThus,\n$$ \\tan(2\\theta) = \\frac{2\\alpha}{3} $$\nSolving for $\\theta$ by taking the inverse tangent:\n$$ 2\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{2\\alpha}{3}\\right) $$\n$$ \\theta(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{2}\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2\\alpha}{3}\\right) $$\nThe range of the principal value of the $\\arctan$ function is $(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, so $\\theta$ lies in $(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{\\pi}{4})$. Since $\\alpha  0$, we have $\\frac{2\\alpha}{3}  0$, which means $2\\theta \\in (0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$ and $\\theta \\in (0, \\frac{\\pi}{4})$. This provides a unique angle for the required rotation.\nThe final answer is the explicit expression for $\\theta(\\alpha)$.",

Given two points $(x,t)$ and $(y,s)$ in space-time, the spatial separation is $|x-y|$ and the temporal separation is $|t-s|$. To combine them into a single distance metric which respects the scaling, the temporal part must be rescaled. The condition requires that if $|x-y| \\to \\lambda |x-y|$, then the time part must scale similarly. Since $t$ scales as $\\lambda^2$, $|t-s|$ scales as $\\lambda^2$, so $|t-s|^{1/2}$ scales as $\\lambda$.\n\nThis motivates defining a distance. There are two common choices:\n$1$. $\\rho_M((x,t),(y,s)) = \\max(|x-y|, |t-s|^{1/2})$\n$2$. $\\rho_A((x,t),(y,s)) = |x-y| + |t-s|^{1/2}$\nBoth satisfy the required homogeneity property. For example, for $\\rho_A$:\n$$\n\\rho_A(\\delta_{\\lambda}(x,t), \\delta_{\\lambda}(y,s)) = \\rho_A((\\lambda x, \\lambda^2 t), (\\lambda y, \\lambda^2 s)) = |\\lambda x - \\lambda y| + |\\lambda^2 t - \\lambda^2 s|^{1/2} = \\lambda|x-y| + \\sqrt{\\lambda^2|t-s|} = \\lambda|x-y| + \\lambda|t-s|^{1/2} = \\lambda(|x-y| + |t-s|^{1/2}) = \\lambda \\rho_A((x,t),(y,s))\n$$\nGiven the function $u(x,t) = (|x|+|t|^{1/2})^{\\alpha}$ in Part 3, the additive form $\\rho_A$ is the most natural and convenient choice. We therefore define the parabolic distance as:\n$$\n\\rho\\big((x,t), (y,s)\\big) := |x-y| + |t-s|^{1/2}\n$$\nwhere $| \\cdot |$ denotes the Euclidean norm in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. This is a valid metric as it satisfies non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles, symmetry, and the triangle inequality.\n\nUsing this distance, we define the parabolic Hölder seminorm of order $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$ for a function $f$ on a domain $Q \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d \\times \\mathbb{R}$. The seminorm, denoted $[f]_{C^{\\alpha}_{\\text{par}}(Q)}$, measures the \"roughness\" of the function with respect to the parabolic geometry. The definition is:\n$$\n[f]_{C^{\\alpha}_{\\text{par}}(Q)} := \\sup_{\\substack{(x,t), (y,s) \\in Q \\\\ (x,t) \\neq (y,s)}} \\frac{|f(x,t) - f(y,s)|}{\\rho\\big((x,t), (y,s)\\big)^{\\alpha}}\n$$\nIn our case, $Q$ is the parabolic cylinder $B_1(0) \\times [-1,1]$.\n\nPart 3: Computation of the seminorm\n\nWe need to compute $[u]_{C^{\\alpha}_{\\text{par}}(Q)}$ for the function $u(x,t) = \\big(|x| + |t|^{1/2}\\big)^{\\alpha}$ on $Q = B_1(0) \\times [-1,1]$, where $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$.\n\nLet's use the distance function $\\rho$ defined in Part 2. We can express the function $u$ using $\\rho$. Let $Z_0=(0,0)$ be the origin in $\\mathbb{R}^d \\times \\mathbb{R}$. Then\n$$\n\\rho((x,t), Z_0) = |x-0| + |t-0|^{1/2} = |x| + |t|^{1/2}\n$$\nSo, the function is $u(x,t) = \\big(\\rho((x,t), Z_0)\\big)^{\\alpha}$. Let's denote the points in $Q$ by $Z_1 = (x,t)$ and $Z_2 = (y,s)$. The seminorm is:\n$$\n[u]_{C^{\\alpha}_{\\text{par}}(Q)} = \\sup_{\\substack{Z_1, Z_2 \\in Q \\\\ Z_1 \\neq Z_2}} \\frac{|\\big(\\rho(Z_1, Z_0)\\big)^{\\alpha} - \\big(\\rho(Z_2, Z_0)\\big)^{\\alpha}|}{\\rho(Z_1, Z_2)^{\\alpha}}\n$$\nBy the triangle inequality for the metric $\\rho$, we have:\n$$\n\\rho(Z_1, Z_0) \\le \\rho(Z_1, Z_2) + \\rho(Z_2, Z_0) \\implies \\rho(Z_1, Z_0) - \\rho(Z_2, Z_0) \\le \\rho(Z_1, Z_2)\n$$\n$$\n\\rho(Z_2, Z_0) \\le \\rho(Z_2, Z_1) + \\rho(Z_1, Z_0) \\implies \\rho(Z_2, Z_0) - \\rho(Z_1, Z_0) \\le \\rho(Z_2, Z_1) = \\rho(Z_1, Z_2)\n$$\nCombining these two inequalities gives $|\\rho(Z_1, Z_0) - \\rho(Z_2, Z_0)| \\le \\rho(Z_1, Z_2)$.\nSince $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$, raising to the power of $\\alpha$ preserves the inequality for non-negative numbers:\n$$\n|\\rho(Z_1, Z_0) - \\rho(Z_2, Z_0)|^{\\alpha} \\le \\rho(Z_1, Z_2)^{\\alpha}\n$$\nThe Hölder quotient is therefore bounded from above:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\big(\\rho(Z_1, Z_0)\\big)^{\\alpha} - \\big(\\rho(Z_2, Z_0)\\big)^{\\alpha}|}{\\rho(Z_1, Z_2)^{\\alpha}} \\le \\frac{|\\big(\\rho(Z_1, Z_0)\\big)^{\\alpha} - \\big(\\rho(Z_2, Z_0)\\big)^{\\alpha}|}{|\\rho(Z_1, Z_0) - \\rho(Z_2, Z_0)|^{\\alpha}}\n$$\nConsider the function $f(z) = z^{\\alpha}$ for $z \\ge 0$ and $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$. For any $a  b \\ge 0$, the concavity of $f$ implies $a^{\\alpha} - b^{\\alpha} \\le (a-b)^{\\alpha}$. This can be proven by considering $g(t) = (a-b)^{\\alpha} - (a^{\\alpha} - b^{\\alpha})$ for $a=b+t$, $t0$. A more direct approach is to show that for $a  b \\ge 0$, the function $\\phi(a) = (a-b)^\\alpha - (a^\\alpha - b^\\alpha)$ is non-negative. $\\phi(b)=0$ and $\\phi'(a) = \\alpha(a-b)^{\\alpha-1} - \\alpha a^{\\alpha-1} \\ge 0$ since $\\alpha-1  0$ and $a-b  a$. So $\\phi(a)$ is increasing from $0$, meaning it's always non-negative.\nThus, for non-negative values $z_1, z_2$:\n$$\n|z_1^{\\alpha} - z_2^{\\alpha}| \\le |z_1 - z_2|^{\\alpha}\n$$\nApplying this with $z_1 = \\rho(Z_1, Z_0)$ and $z_2 = \\rho(Z_2, Z_0)$, we get:\n$$\n|\\big(\\rho(Z_1, Z_0)\\big)^{\\alpha} - \\big(\\rho(Z_2, Z_0)\\big)^{\\alpha}| \\le |\\rho(Z_1, Z_0) - \\rho(Z_2, Z_0)|^{\\alpha}\n$$\nTherefore, the Hölder quotient is bounded by $1$:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\big(\\rho(Z_1, Z_0)\\big)^{\\alpha} - \\big(\\rho(Z_2, Z_0)\\big)^{\\alpha}|}{\\rho(Z_1, Z_2)^{\\alpha}} \\le \\frac{|\\rho(Z_1, Z_0) - \\rho(Z_2, Z_0)|^{\\alpha}}{|\\rho(Z_1, Z_0) - \\rho(Z_2, Z_0)|^{\\alpha}} = 1\n$$\nThis implies that $[u]_{C^{\\alpha}_{\\text{par}}(Q)} \\le 1$.\n\nTo show that the supremum is exactly $1$, we must show that this bound is attained or can be approached. Let's choose $Z_2 = Z_0 = (0,0)$. The point $(0,0)$ is in the domain $Q = B_1(0) \\times [-1,1]$. Let $Z_1 = (x,t)$ be any other point in $Q$. For this pair of points, the Hölder quotient becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{|u(x,t) - u(0,0)|}{\\rho\\big((x,t), (0,0)\\big)^{\\alpha}} = \\frac{|\\big(|x| + |t|^{1/2}\\big)^{\\alpha} - \\big(|0| + |0|^{1/2}\\big)^{\\alpha}|}{\\big(|x-0| + |t-0|^{1/2}\\big)^{\\alpha}} = \\frac{\\big(|x| + |t|^{1/2}\\big)^{\\alpha}}{\\big(|x| + |t|^{1/2}\\big)^{\\alpha}} = 1\n$$\nThis holds for any $Z_1 = (x,t) \\in Q$ such that $(x,t) \\ne (0,0)$. Since we have found pairs of points in $Q$ for which the ratio is exactly $1$, the supremum over all pairs of points must be at least $1$.\n\nSince $[u]_{C^{\\alpha}_{\\text{par}}(Q)} \\le 1$ and $[u]_{C^{\\alpha}_{\\text{par}}(Q)} \\ge 1$, we conclude that the value of the seminorm is exactly $1$. The result is independent of the dimension $d$ and the parameter $\\alpha \\in(0,1)$.",
