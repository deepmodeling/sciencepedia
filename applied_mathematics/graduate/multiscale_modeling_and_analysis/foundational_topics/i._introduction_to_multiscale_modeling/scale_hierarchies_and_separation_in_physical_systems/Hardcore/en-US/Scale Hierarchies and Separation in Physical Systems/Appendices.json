            "solution": "The problem as stated is a standard, well-posed, and scientifically grounded boundary value problem from the field of applied mathematics, specifically singular perturbation theory. It models a steady-state one-dimensional convection-diffusion process where convection dominates diffusion ($0 < \\epsilon \\ll 1$). The problem provides a clear differential equation, well-defined boundary conditions, and a precise set of tasks. It is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be constructed following the requested steps.\n\nThe governing equation is\n$$-\\epsilon\\,u''(x) + u'(x) = 1, \\quad x \\in (0,1)$$\nwith boundary conditions\n$$u(0) = 0, \\quad u(1) = 0$$\n\n**1. Dominant-Balance and Boundary Layer Analysis**\n\nIn the outer region, away from any boundary layers, we assume that $u(x)$ and its derivatives scale as $O(1)$. In the limit $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the term $-\\epsilon u''$ is negligible compared to $u'$. The dominant balance is thus between the convection term and the source term:\n$$u'(x) \\approx 1$$\nThis is the outer equation. Integrating gives the leading-order outer solution:\n$$u_{\\text{out}}(x) = x + C$$\nThis first-order equation can satisfy only one of the two boundary conditions. The presence of the small parameter $\\epsilon$ multiplying the highest derivative, $u''$, is the source of this singularity and necessitates a boundary layer where the neglected term becomes important.\n\nTo determine the location of the boundary layer, we consider which boundary condition the outer solution should satisfy. For convection-dominated problems with flow in the positive $x$ direction (as indicated by the positive coefficient of $u'$), information is carried from left to right. Thus, the outer solution is typically governed by the upstream boundary condition at $x=0$. Applying $u(0)=0$ to $u_{\\text{out}}(x) = x+C$ gives $C=0$. The leading-order outer solution is therefore $u_{0}(x) = x$. This solution satisfies $u_{0}(0)=0$ but fails at the downstream boundary, where $u_{0}(1) = 1 \\neq 0$. The discrepancy at $x=1$ indicates a boundary layer must exist there to correct the solution and enforce the condition $u(1)=0$.\n\nTo determine the thickness of this boundary layer, we introduce a stretched coordinate $X$ centered at $x=1$. Let the layer thickness be $\\delta(\\epsilon)$. We define $X = \\frac{1-x}{\\delta}$.\nThe derivatives transform as:\n$$\\frac{d}{dx} = \\frac{dX}{dx}\\frac{d}{dX} = -\\frac{1}{\\delta}\\frac{d}{dX}$$\n$$\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\delta}\\frac{d}{dX}\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\delta}\\frac{d}{dX}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\delta^2}\\frac{d^2}{dX^2}$$\nSubstituting these into the original ODE gives the inner equation in terms of $X$:\n$$-\\epsilon\\left(\\frac{1}{\\delta^2}\\frac{d^2u}{dX^2}\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\delta}\\frac{du}{dX}\\right) = 1$$\nIn the boundary layer, the singular term $-\\epsilon u''$ must be as important as at least one other term. We seek a dominant balance.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Balancing diffusion and convection: $\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\delta^2} \\sim \\frac{1}{\\delta} \\implies \\delta \\sim \\epsilon$.\n    \\item Balancing diffusion and source: $\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\delta^2} \\sim 1 \\implies \\delta \\sim \\sqrt{\\epsilon}$.\n\\end{itemize}\nIf we choose $\\delta=\\epsilon$, the equation becomes $-\\frac{d^2u}{dX^2} - \\frac{du}{dX} = \\epsilon$. To leading order ($O(1)$), we have $-u_{XX}-u_X=0$, which is a valid balance. The neglected term is $O(\\epsilon)$.\nIf we choose $\\delta=\\sqrt{\\epsilon}$, the equation becomes $-\\frac{d^2u}{dX^2} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}}\\frac{du}{dX} = 1$. The convection term is of order $1/\\sqrt{\\epsilon}$ and dominates the other two $O(1)$ terms, which contradicts the premise of a balance.\nThus, the correct scaling for the boundary layer thickness is $\\delta=\\epsilon$. The boundary layer is at $x=1$ with thickness $O(\\epsilon)$.\n\n**2. Outer Expansion**\n\nWe seek an outer solution of the form $u^{\\text{out}}(x) = u_0(x) + \\epsilon u_1(x) + O(\\epsilon^2)$. Substituting into the ODE:\n$$-\\epsilon(u_0'' + \\epsilon u_1'' + \\dots) + (u_0' + \\epsilon u_1' + \\dots) = 1$$\nEquating coefficients of powers of $\\epsilon$:\n$O(1): u_0' = 1$\n$O(\\epsilon): u_1' = u_0''$\n\nThe outer solution must satisfy the boundary condition at $x=0$, so $u^{\\text{out}}(0)=0$. This implies $u_0(0)=0$ and $u_1(0)=0$.\nFrom $u_0'=1$ and $u_0(0)=0$, we integrate to find $u_0(x) = x$.\nThen, for the $O(\\epsilon)$ term, $u_1' = u_0'' = \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}(x) = 0$.\nIntegrating $u_1'=0$ with the condition $u_1(0)=0$ gives $u_1(x) = 0$.\nThus, the outer expansion up to order $\\epsilon$ is:\n$$u^{\\text{out}}(x) = x + \\epsilon(0) = x$$\n\n**3. Inner Expansion and Matching**\n\nThe boundary layer is at $x=1$. We use the stretched coordinate $X = \\frac{1-x}{\\epsilon}$. The ODE transforms to:\n$$-\\frac{d^2u}{dX^2} - \\frac{du}{dX} = \\epsilon$$\nLet the inner solution be $U^{\\text{in}}(X) = U_0(X) + \\epsilon U_1(X) + O(\\epsilon^2)$. Substituting into the transformed ODE:\n$$-(U_0'' + \\epsilon U_1'' + \\dots) - (U_0' + \\epsilon U_1' + \\dots) = \\epsilon$$\nEquating coefficients of powers of $\\epsilon$:\n$O(1): -U_0'' - U_0' = 0 \\implies U_0'' + U_0' = 0$\n$O(\\epsilon): -U_1'' - U_1' = 1 \\implies U_1'' + U_1' = -1$\n\nThe inner solution must satisfy the boundary condition at $x=1$ ($X=0$), so $U^{\\text{in}}(0)=0$. This implies $U_0(0)=0$ and $U_1(0)=0$.\n\nSolving for $U_0(X)$: The general solution is $U_0(X) = A_0 + B_0 e^{-X}$. The condition $U_0(0)=0$ gives $A_0+B_0=0$, so $B_0=-A_0$. Thus, $U_0(X) = A_0(1-e^{-X})$.\n\nSolving for $U_1(X)$: The homogeneous solution is $A_1 + B_1 e^{-X}$. A particular solution is $U_{1,p}(X) = -X$. The general solution is $U_1(X) = -X + A_1 + B_1 e^{-X}$. The condition $U_1(0)=0$ gives $A_1+B_1=0$, so $B_1=-A_1$. Thus, $U_1(X) = -X + A_1(1-e^{-X})$.\n\nTo find the unknown constants $A_0$ and $A_1$, we use asymptotic matching. The inner expansion of the outer solution must match the outer expansion of the inner solution in an intermediate overlap region.\n\nInner expansion of outer solution ($u^{\\text{out}}$ in terms of $X$):\n$$u^{\\text{out}}(x) = x = 1 - \\epsilon X$$\nThis is an expansion to $O(\\epsilon)$.\n\nOuter expansion of inner solution ($U^{\\text{in}}$ for $X \\to \\infty$):\n$$U^{\\text{in}}(X) = U_0(X) + \\epsilon U_1(X) = A_0(1-e^{-X}) + \\epsilon[-X + A_1(1-e^{-X})]$$\nAs $X \\to \\infty$, $e^{-X} \\to 0$. We obtain the outer expansion:\n$$\\lim_{X\\to\\infty} U^{\\text{in}}(X) \\approx A_0 + \\epsilon(-X + A_1) = A_0 + \\epsilon A_1 - \\epsilon X$$\nEquating the two expansions:\n$$1 - \\epsilon X = A_0 + \\epsilon A_1 - \\epsilon X$$\nComparing coefficients of powers of $\\epsilon$:\n$O(1): 1 = A_0$\n$O(\\epsilon): -X = A_1 - X \\implies A_1 = 0$\n\nWith these constants, the inner expansion is determined:\n$A_0=1 \\implies B_0 = -1$, so $U_0(X) = 1 - e^{-X}$.\n$A_1=0 \\implies B_1 = 0$, so $U_1(X) = -X$.\nThe inner expansion up to $O(\\epsilon)$ is:\n$$U^{\\text{in}}(X) = (1 - e^{-X}) - \\epsilon X$$\n\n**4. Uniformly Valid Composite Approximation**\n\nA uniformly valid composite approximation, $u_{\\text{comp}}(x)$, can be constructed by adding the outer and inner solutions and subtracting their common part (to avoid double-counting).\n$$u_{\\text{comp}}(x) = u^{\\text{out}}(x) + U^{\\text{in}}(X) - (\\text{common part})$$\nThe approximation should be valid to first algebraic order, so we use the expansions derived above.\n- Outer solution: $u^{\\text{out}}(x) = x$.\n- Inner solution: $U^{\\text{in}}(X) = (1-e^{-X}) - \\epsilon X$.\n- Common part: The common part is the portion matched between the two solutions, which is the inner expansion of the outer solution, $1 - \\epsilon X$.\n\nCombining these:\n$$u_{\\text{comp}}(x) = x + \\left[ (1 - e^{-X}) - \\epsilon X \\right] - (1 - \\epsilon X)$$\n$$u_{\\text{comp}}(x) = x + 1 - e^{-X} - \\epsilon X - 1 + \\epsilon X$$\n$$u_{\\text{comp}}(x) = x - e^{-X}$$\nFinally, we substitute back the original variable $x$ using $X=\\frac{1-x}{\\epsilon}$:\n$$u_{\\text{comp}}(x) = x - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1-x}{\\epsilon}\\right)$$\nThis is the composite approximation, uniformly valid in $x \\in [0,1]$ to first order in $\\epsilon$.",

Partial-Equilibrium Approximation (PEA)**\n\nThe PEA is justified when the first reversible reaction is much faster than the second irreversible reaction. This means that the rate constants for the first step are much larger than the rate constant for the second step, specifically $k_1, k_{-1} \\gg k_2$. Under this condition, the first reaction $A + B \\rightleftharpoons C$ rapidly reaches a state of equilibrium, and it remains in this equilibrium as the product $P$ is slowly formed.\n\nThe equilibrium condition for the first reaction implies that the net rate of this reaction is approximately zero. The forward rate, $R_1 = k_1 a b$, and the reverse rate, $R_{-1} = k_{-1} c$, become nearly equal.\n$$\nk_1 a b \\approx k_{-1} c\n$$\nThis algebraic relationship allows us to express the concentration of the intermediate, $c$, in terms of the concentrations of the reactants, $a$ and $b$:\n$$\nc_{\\text{PEA}} = \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}} a b\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}}$ is the equilibrium constant for the first reaction, often denoted as $K_{eq}$.\n\nThe rate of production of $P$ is given by $\\frac{d p}{d t} = k_2 c$. Substituting the expression for $c_{\\text{PEA}}$ into this rate law yields the reduced expression for the rate of product formation under the PEA:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d p}{d t}\\right)_{\\text{PEA}} = k_2 c_{\\text{PEA}} = k_2 \\left(\\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}} a b\\right)\n$$\nTherefore, the production rate under PEA is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d p}{d t}\\right)_{\\text{PEA}} = \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1}} a b\n$$\n\n**2. Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA)**\n\nThe QSSA is applied to a highly reactive intermediate species whose concentration remains low and nearly constant throughout most of the reaction, after a brief initial induction period. Since $c(0)=0$, the concentration of $C$ will initially rise but will quickly reach a \"quasi-steady state\" where its rate of formation is approximately equal to its rate of consumption. This means its net rate of change is approximately zero.\n\nThe assumption for the QSSA is:\n$$\n\\frac{d c}{d t} \\approx 0\n$$\nApplying this to the differential equation for $c$:\n$$\n\\frac{d c}{d t} = k_1 a b - k_{-1} c - k_2 c \\approx 0\n$$\nWe can solve this algebraic equation for the steady-state concentration of the intermediate, $c_{\\text{QSSA}}$:\n$$\nk_1 a b \\approx (k_{-1} + k_2) c\n$$\n$$\nc_{\\text{QSSA}} = \\frac{k_1 a b}{k_{-1} + k_2}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $c$ into the rate law for the product $P$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d p}{d t}\\right)_{\\text{QSSA}} = k_2 c_{\\text{QSSA}} = k_2 \\left(\\frac{k_1 a b}{k_{-1} + k_2}\\right)\n$$\nTherefore, the production rate under QSSA is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d p}{d t}\\right)_{\\text{QSSA}} = \\frac{k_1 k_2 a b}{k_{-1} + k_2}\n$$\n\n**Summary of Results**\n\nThe two approximations yield distinct expressions for the rate of product formation.\n- Under PEA, the assumption is that the first reaction is at equilibrium ($k_1 a b = k_{-1} c$), which is valid if $k_{-1} \\gg k_2$. The rate is $\\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1}} a b$.\n- Under QSSA, the assumption is that the intermediate concentration is at a steady state ($\\frac{dc}{dt} = 0$), which is valid if $C$ is a low-concentration, short-lived species. The rate is $\\frac{k_1 k_2 a b}{k_{-1} + k_2}$.\n\nIt is important to note that the PEA is a special limiting case of the QSSA. If we take the QSSA result and apply the condition for PEA, which is that the backward dissociation of $C$ is much faster than the conversion of $C$ to $P$ (i.e., $k_{-1} \\gg k_2$), then the denominator in the QSSA expression simplifies:\n$$\nk_{-1} + k_2 \\approx k_{-1}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the QSSA rate expression gives:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d p}{d t}\\right)_{\\text{QSSA}} \\rightarrow \\frac{k_1 k_2 a b}{k_{-1}}\n$$\nThis is precisely the expression obtained from the PEA. Thus, the PEA is a more restrictive assumption than the QSSA.\n\nThe final answer requires the pair of analytical expressions for $\\frac{d p}{d t}$ under PEA and QSSA.\n- PEA expression: $\\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1}} a b$\n- QSSA expression: $\\frac{k_1 k_2 a b}{k_{-1} + k_2}$",
