            "problem": "Within the framework of Density Functional Theory (DFT), the ground-state energy $E[v]$ is a functional of the external potential $v(\\mathbf{r})$. This functional possesses several key mathematical properties derived from the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems. This problem explores two of these properties to establish bounds on the ground-state energy of a system.\n\nConsider a single particle of mass $m$ constrained to move in one dimension. The particle is subject to an external potential. We are given two reference systems:\n1.  **System 1:** The particle is in an external potential $v_1(x) = \\frac{1}{2}k(x-a)^2$.

If $\\Psi'$ is chosen to be the ground state of another system with potential $v'$, this gives the relation $E[v] \\le E[v'] + \\int (v(x) - v'(x))n_{v'}(x) dx$, where $n_{v'}(x)$ is the ground-state density corresponding to $v'$.\n\nYour task is to find a rigorous lower bound $L$ and the tightest possible rigorous upper bound $U$ for $E_{avg}$ using only the information from systems 1 and 2 and the principles stated above.
