            "problem": "In multiscale materials simulation, the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) for exchange-correlation within Density Functional Theory (DFT) refines the Local Density Approximation by incorporating spatial variations of the electron density.

It is a standard derivation within the framework of Density Functional Theory.\n\nThe task is to derive the expression for the reduced density gradient, $s(\\mathbf{r})$, for a given spherically symmetric electron density, $n(\\mathbf{r}) = n_0 \\exp(-\\alpha r^2)$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the foundational definitions used in the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA). The reduced density gradient, $s(\\mathbf{r})$, is a dimensionless quantity that measures the local inhomogeneity of the electron gas. It is defined as:\n$$\ns(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{|\\nabla n(\\mathbf{r})|}{2 k_{\\mathrm{F}}(\\mathbf{r}) n(\\mathbf{r})}\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla n(\\mathbf{r})$ is the gradient of the electron density $n(\\mathbf{r})$, and $k_{\\mathrm{F}}(\\mathbf{r})$ is the local Fermi wavevector.\n\nThe local Fermi wavevector, $k_{\\mathrm{F}}(\\mathbf{r})$, is defined by treating the electron gas at position $\\mathbf{r}$ as a homogeneous electron gas with density $n(\\mathbf{r})$. For a three-dimensional system, its expression is:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{F}}(\\mathbf{r}) = (3\\pi^2 n(\\mathbf{r}))^{1/3}\n$$\nSubstituting this definition of $k_{\\mathrm{F}}(\\mathbf{r})$ into the expression for $s(\\mathbf{r})$ yields:\n$$\ns(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{|\\nabla n(\\mathbf{r})|}{2 (3\\pi^2 n(\\mathbf{r}))^{1/3} n(\\mathbf{r})} = \\frac{|\\nabla n(\\mathbf{r})|}{2 (3\\pi^2)^{1/3} n(\\mathbf{r})^{4/3}}\n$$\nNext, we must compute the gradient of the given electron density, $n(\\mathbf{r}) = n_0 \\exp(-\\alpha r^2)$, where $r = |\\mathbf{r}|$. Due to the spherical symmetry of $n$, the gradient vector will point in the radial direction, $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$. We can write the gradient as $\\nabla n(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{d n(r)}{dr} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$.\nWe compute the derivative with respect to $r$:\n$$\n\\frac{d n(r)}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( n_0 \\exp(-\\alpha r^2) \\right) = n_0 \\exp(-\\alpha r^2) (-2\\alpha r)\n$$\nRecognizing that $n_0 \\exp(-\\alpha r^2)$ is the density $n(r)$ itself, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{d n(r)}{dr} = -2\\alpha r n(r)\n$$\nThe gradient vector is therefore $\\nabla n(\\mathbf{r}) = -2\\alpha r n(r) \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$. The magnitude of the gradient is:\n$$\n|\\nabla n(\\mathbf{r})| = |-2\\alpha r n(r)| = 2\\alpha r n(r)\n$$\nsince the parameters $\\alpha$ and $n_0$ are positive, and $r \\ge 0$.\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $|\\nabla n(\\mathbf{r})|$ into our equation for $s(\\mathbf{r})$:\n$$\ns(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{2\\alpha r n(r)}{2 (3\\pi^2)^{1/3} n(r)^{4/3}}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression by canceling the factor of $2$ and combining the terms involving $n(r)$:\n$$\ns(r) = \\frac{\\alpha r}{(3\\pi^2)^{1/3} n(r)^{1/3}}\n$$\nThe dependence is only on the radial distance $r$, as expected from spherical symmetry. The final step is to substitute the explicit form of $n(r)$:\n$$\nn(r)^{1/3} = \\left( n_0 \\exp(-\\alpha r^2) \\right)^{1/3} = n_0^{1/3} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha r^2}{3}\\right)\n$$\nInserting this into the expression for $s(r)$:\n$$\ns(r) = \\frac{\\alpha r}{(3\\pi^2)^{1/3} n_0^{1/3} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha r^2}{3}\\right)}\n$$\nThis can be written in a more compact closed form by combining constants and moving the exponential term to the numerator:\n$$\ns(r) = \\frac{\\alpha r}{\\left(3 \\pi^2 n_0\\right)^{1/3}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha r^2}{3}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the reduced density gradient.\n\nAnalysis of the behavior of $s(r)$:\n$1$. Dependence on $r$:\nFor small $r$ ($r \\to 0$): The term $\\exp(\\frac{\\alpha r^2}{3})$ approaches $1$. Therefore, $s(r) \\approx \\frac{\\alpha r}{(3 \\pi^2 n_0)^{1/3}}$. The reduced gradient starts at $s(0)=0$ and increases linearly with $r$. This is physically correct, as at the center of a symmetric distribution, the gradient is zero, implying zero inhomogeneity.\nFor large $r$ ($r \\to \\infty$): Both the linear term $r$ and the exponential term $\\exp(\\frac{\\alpha r^2}{3})$ go to infinity. The exponential term dominates, causing $s(r)$ to grow extremely rapidly. This indicates that the tail of the electron distribution is a region of very high inhomogeneity, where the density changes rapidly on the scale of the local Fermi wavelength.\n\n$2$. Dependence on $\\alpha$: The parameter $\\alpha$ controls the localization of the density; a larger $\\alpha$ corresponds to a more sharply peaked, localized distribution. For any fixed radius $r > 0$, the function $s(r)$ is an increasing function of $\\alpha$. This is because both the prefactor $\\alpha$ and the argument of the exponential, $\\frac{\\alpha r^2}{3}$, increase with $\\alpha$. This aligns with the physical intuition that a more rapidly changing density profile (larger $\\alpha$) corresponds to a greater degree of inhomogeneity.\n\n$3$. Dependence on $n_0$: The quantity $s(r)$ is proportional to $n_0^{-1/3}$. Increasing the peak density $n_0$ while keeping the shape parameter $\\alpha$ fixed leads to a decrease in the reduced gradient $s$ at all points $r$. This reflects the fact that in regions of higher electron density, the system behaves more like a homogeneous electron gas, and thus the same absolute gradient $|\\nabla n|$ is considered less significant.",

By performing polynomial division or algebraic manipulation:\n$$\nF_{x}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(s) = \\frac{1 + \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}s^2 + \\mu s^2}{1 + \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}s^2} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}s^2}{1 + \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}s^2} + \\frac{\\mu s^2}{1 + \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}s^2} = 1 + \\frac{\\mu s^2}{1 + \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}s^2}\n$$\nThis is the standard form for the PBE exchange enhancement factor.\n\nFinally, we must check the monotonicity condition. We need to verify that $\\frac{dF_{x}}{ds} \\geq 0$ for $s \\geq 0$. We compute the derivative of $F_{x}(s)$ with respect to $s$:\n$$\n\\frac{dF_{x}}{ds} = \\frac{d}{ds}\\left(1 + \\frac{\\mu s^2}{1 + \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}s^2}\\right) = \\frac{ (2\\mu s)\\left(1 + \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}s^2\\right) - (\\mu s^2)\\left(2\\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}s\\right) }{ \\left(1 + \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}s^2\\right)^2 }\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dF_{x}}{ds} = \\frac{ 2\\mu s + \\frac{2\\mu^2}{\\kappa}s^3 - \\frac{2\\mu^2}{\\kappa}s^3 }{ \\left(1 + \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}s^2\\right)^2 } = \\frac{2\\mu s}{\\left(1 + \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}s^2\\right)^2}\n$$\nThe problem provides a numerical value for $\\mu = 0.21951$, which is positive. The denominator is a square and is therefore always non-negative. For $s \\geq 0$, the numerator $2\\mu s$ is also non-negative. Thus, $\\frac{dF_x}{ds} \\geq 0$ for $s \\geq 0$, and the function is monotone increasing as required.\n\nNow we proceed with the numerical calculation. We are asked to compute $F_{x}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(s)$ for $s=2$, using the parameters $\\mu=0.21951$ and $\\kappa=0.804$.\nUsing the derived formula:\n$$\nF_{x}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(2) = 1 + \\frac{\\mu (2^2)}{1 + \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}(2^2)} = 1 + \\frac{4\\mu}{1 + \\frac{4\\mu}{\\kappa}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nF_{x}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(2) = 1 + \\frac{4(0.21951)}{1 + \\frac{4(0.21951)}{0.804}}\n$$\n$$\nF_{x}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(2) = 1 + \\frac{0.87804}{1 + \\frac{0.87804}{0.804}}\n$$\nFirst, calculate the term inside the denominator:\n$$\n\\frac{0.87804}{0.804} \\approx 1.09208955...\n$$\nNow, substitute this back into the main expression:\n$$\nF_{x}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(2) \\approx 1 + \\frac{0.87804}{1 + 1.09208955} = 1 + \\frac{0.87804}{2.09208955}\n$$\n$$\nF_{x}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(2) \\approx 1 + 0.41969300...\n$$\n$$\nF_{x}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(2) \\approx 1.41969300...\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $1.420$.\n\nThe relative enhancement beyond LDA is given by $F_{x}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(s)-1$. For $s=2$, this value is $F_{x}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(2)-1 \\approx 0.4197$. This signifies that for a region with a reduced density gradient of $s=2$, the PBE approximation for the exchange energy density is about $42\\%$ larger than the LDA prediction. This is a substantial correction, underscoring the physical importance of including density gradient information to improve upon the LDA, which is strictly valid only for a uniform electron gas ($s=0$).",
