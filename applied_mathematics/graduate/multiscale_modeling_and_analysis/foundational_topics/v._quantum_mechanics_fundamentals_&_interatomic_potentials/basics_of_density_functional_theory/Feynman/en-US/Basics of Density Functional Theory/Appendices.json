A crucial step in understanding DFT is to correctly interpret the physical meaning of these KS eigenvalues, which can be subtly different from the orbital energies in Hartree-Fock theory. This practice  explores the validity of Koopmans-like theorems in both frameworks, clarifying which relationships between orbital energies and physical observables like ionization potentials are exact and which are only approximations. Mastering this distinction is key to correctly interpreting the results of DFT calculations and understanding concepts like the infamous \"band gap problem\".",

All definitions ($I$, $A$, $E_g$, $v_s$) and concepts are standard in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides clear, standard definitions for all quantities and theoretical frameworks (\"exact Kohn-Sham DFT\", \"HF theory under the frozen-orbital approximation\"). It asks for the validity of specific mathematical equalities within these frameworks, which is a well-defined question with a unique answer based on established theorems.\n3.  **Objective:** The language is formal, precise, and devoid of subjectivity. The terms are standard and unambiguous in the context of the specified theories.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. The provided definitions are sufficient to evaluate each statement without needing external, unstated assumptions. There are no internal contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is found to be valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. The analysis will proceed to the solution phase.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires an evaluation of five statements concerning the physical interpretation of orbital energies in exact Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Hartree-Fock (HF) theory.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In exact Kohn–Sham Density Functional Theory (DFT), for the neutral $N$-electron system, the negative of the highest occupied KS eigenvalue equals the first ionization potential: $I = -\\varepsilon_{\\text{HOMO}}$.**\n\nThis statement addresses the physical meaning of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy in exact KS-DFT. According to Janak's theorem, the KS eigenvalue $\\varepsilon_i$ is the partial derivative of the total energy $E$ with respect to the occupation number $n_i$ of the corresponding orbital: $\\varepsilon_i = \\partial E / \\partial n_i$.\n\nFor the exact functional, the total energy $E(M)$ as a function of a continuously variable number of electrons $M$ is a series of straight-line segments connecting the points at integer electron numbers. For a non-integer number of electrons $M$ in the interval $(N-1, N)$, the ground state consists of a statistical mixture of $(N-1)$- and $N$-electron states. The energy is given by linearity: $E(M) = (N-M)E(N-1) + (M-(N-1))E(N)$.\n\nThe derivative of the energy with respect to the number of electrons in this interval is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial M} = -E(N-1) + E(N) = -(E(N-1) - E(N)) = -I\n$$\nThis derivative must be equal to the energy of the highest occupied level for any system with a fractional number of electrons between $N-1$ and $N$. In the limit as $M \\to N$ from below ($M \\to N^-$), this level becomes the HOMO of the $N$-electron system. Therefore, in exact DFT, the energy of the highest occupied Kohn-Sham orbital of the neutral $N$-electron system is precisely the negative of the first ionization potential.\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\text{HOMO}}(N) = \\left. \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial M} \\right|_{M \\to N^-} = -I\n$$\nThis is a well-known result, often called the Ionization Potential Theorem of DFT.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. In exact Kohn–Sham Density Functional Theory (DFT), for the neutral $N$-electron system, the negative of the lowest unoccupied KS eigenvalue equals the electron affinity: $A = -\\varepsilon_{\\text{LUMO}}$.**\n\nFollowing the same logic as in A, let's consider the energy $E(M)$ for $M$ in the interval $(N, N+1)$. The energy is given by $E(M) = (N+1-M)E(N) + (M-N)E(N+1)$. The derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial M} = -E(N) + E(N+1) = -(E(N) - E(N+1)) = -A\n$$\nThis derivative corresponds to the energy of the electron being added. In a system with a fractional number of electrons $N+\\delta$ (where $\\delta \\to 0^+$), this electron occupies what was the LUMO of the $N$-electron system, but in the potential of the $(N+\\delta)$-electron system. This becomes the HOMO of the $(N+1)$-electron system in the limit. So, we have the exact relation $A = -\\varepsilon_{\\text{HOMO}}(N+1)$.\n\nThe statement in option B, however, refers to the LUMO energy of the neutral $N$-electron system, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{LUMO}}(N)$. In general, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{LUMO}}(N) \\neq \\varepsilon_{\\text{HOMO}}(N+1)$. This is because the effective KS potential $v_s(\\mathbf{r})$ changes as the electron number crosses an integer value. The exact exchange-correlation potential $v_{xc}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\delta E_{xc}[n]/\\delta n(\\mathbf{r})$ exhibits a derivative discontinuity. This means that the potential for a system with $N+\\delta$ electrons differs from the potential for an $N$-electron system by a spatially constant shift (as $|\\mathbf{r}| \\to \\infty$). This shift lifts the entire unoccupied orbital energy spectrum, including the LUMO. Consequently, $-\\varepsilon_{\\text{LUMO}}(N) \\neq A$.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. In Hartree–Fock (HF) theory under the frozen-orbital approximation, for any occupied orbital $i$ of the neutral $N$-electron ground state, the vertical ionization energy to the $(N-1)$-electron state obtained by removing an electron from orbital $i$ equals the negative HF orbital energy: $I_i^{\\text{(frozen HF)}} = -\\varepsilon_i^{\\text{HF}}$.**\n\nThis is the statement of Koopmans' theorem. Let us verify it. The total HF energy for an $N$-electron system with spin-orbitals $\\{\\phi_k^{\\text{HF}}\\}_{k=1}^N$ is:\n$$\nE_{\\text{HF}}(N) = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\langle \\phi_i^{\\text{HF}} | \\hat{h} | \\phi_i^{\\text{HF}} \\rangle + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i,j=1}^N \\left( \\langle \\phi_i^{\\text{HF}}\\phi_j^{\\text{HF}} | \\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r}_2|} | \\phi_i^{\\text{HF}}\\phi_j^{\\text{HF}} \\rangle - \\langle \\phi_i^{\\text{HF}}\\phi_j^{\\text{HF}} | \\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r}_2|} | \\phi_j^{\\text{HF}}\\phi_i^{\\text{HF}} \\rangle \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{h}$ is the one-electron operator (kinetic + external potential). The energy of the HF orbital $\\phi_k^{\\text{HF}}$ is the eigenvalue of the Fock operator $\\hat{f}$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_k^{\\text{HF}} = \\langle \\phi_k^{\\text{HF}} | \\hat{f} | \\phi_k^{\\text{HF}} \\rangle = \\langle \\phi_k^{\\text{HF}} | \\hat{h} | \\phi_k^{\\text{HF}} \\rangle + \\sum_{j=1}^N \\left( \\langle \\phi_k^{\\text{HF}}\\phi_j^{\\text{HF}} | \\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r}_2|} | \\phi_k^{\\text{HF}}\\phi_j^{\\text{HF}} \\rangle - \\langle \\phi_k^{\\text{HF}}\\phi_j^{\\text{HF}} | \\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r}_2|} | \\phi_j^{\\text{HF}}\\phi_k^{\\text{HF}} \\rangle \\right)\n$$\nThe frozen-orbital approximation assumes that upon removing the electron from orbital $\\phi_k^{\\text{HF}}$, the remaining $(N-1)$ orbitals do not relax. The energy of the resulting ion, $E_{\\text{ion}, k}(N-1)$, is calculated with the same orbitals:\n$$\nE_{\\text{ion}, k}(N-1) = \\sum_{i \\neq k} \\langle \\phi_i^{\\text{HF}} | \\hat{h} | \\phi_i^{\\text{HF}} \\rangle + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i,j \\neq k} \\left( \\langle \\phi_i^{\\text{HF}}\\phi_j^{\\text{HF}} | ... | \\phi_i^{\\text{HF}}\\phi_j^{\\text{HF}} \\rangle - \\langle \\phi_i^{\\text{HF}}\\phi_j^{\\text{HF}} | ... | \\phi_j^{\\text{HF}}\\phi_i^{\\text{HF}} \\rangle \\right)\n$$\nThe vertical ionization energy is $I_k = E_{\\text{ion}, k}(N-1) - E_{\\text{HF}}(N)$. Subtracting the expression for $E_{\\text{HF}}(N)$ from $E_{\\text{ion}, k}(N-1)$ gives:\n$$\nI_k = - \\langle \\phi_k^{\\text{HF}} | \\hat{h} | \\phi_k^{\\text{HF}} \\rangle - \\sum_{j=1}^N \\left( \\langle \\phi_k^{\\text{HF}}\\phi_j^{\\text{HF}} | ... | \\phi_k^{\\text{HF}}\\phi_j^{\\text{HF}} \\rangle - \\langle \\phi_k^{\\text{HF}}\\phi_j^{\\text{HF}} | ... | \\phi_j^{\\text{HF}}\\phi_k^{\\text{HF}} \\rangle \\right) = -\\varepsilon_k^{\\text{HF}}\n$$\nThis identity is exact within the stated theoretical framework (HF theory) and approximation (frozen-orbital).\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. In exact Kohn–Sham Density Functional Theory (DFT) for finite systems, the fundamental gap equals the Kohn–Sham eigenvalue gap: $E_{\\text{g}} = \\varepsilon_{\\text{LUMO}} - \\varepsilon_{\\text{HOMO}}$.**\n\nThe fundamental gap is defined as $E_{\\text{g}} = I - A$. The KS eigenvalue gap is $\\varepsilon_{\\text{LUMO}} - \\varepsilon_{\\text{HOMO}}$.\nFrom the analysis of option A, in exact DFT we have $I = -\\varepsilon_{\\text{HOMO}}$.\nSubstituting this into the statement gives:\n$$\n(-\\varepsilon_{\\text{HOMO}}) - A = \\varepsilon_{\\text{LUMO}} - \\varepsilon_{\\text{HOMO}} \\implies -A = \\varepsilon_{\\text{LUMO}}\n$$\nThis is precisely the statement from option B, which we have already shown to be incorrect. The difference between the fundamental gap and the KS gap is the derivative discontinuity of the exchange-correlation functional, $\\Delta_{xc}$. The exact relation is:\n$$\nE_{\\text{g}} = I - A = (\\varepsilon_{\\text{LUMO}}(N) - \\varepsilon_{\\text{HOMO}}(N)) + \\Delta_{xc}\n$$\nSince $\\Delta_{xc} > 0$ for typical systems, the KS gap underestimates the fundamental gap. This is a famous deficiency of approximate functionals (like LDA/GGA), which lack this discontinuity, leading to the well-known \"band gap problem\". But even in exact DFT, the equality $E_{\\text{g}} = \\varepsilon_{\\text{LUMO}} - \\varepsilon_{\\text{HOMO}}$ does not hold.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. In exact Kohn–Sham Density Functional Theory (DFT), the total ground-state energy equals the sum of occupied Kohn–Sham eigenvalues: $E(N) = \\sum_{i \\in \\text{occ}} \\varepsilon_i$.**\n\nThis statement proposes a simple relation for the total energy. Let's write the expression for the sum of occupied eigenvalues and compare it to the total energy expression.\nThe sum of occupied KS eigenvalues is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^N \\varepsilon_i = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\langle \\phi_i | -\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2 + v_s | \\phi_i \\rangle = T_s[n] + \\int v_s(\\mathbf{r}) n(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r}\n$$\nwhere $T_s[n]$ is the kinetic energy of the non-interacting system. Substituting $v_s = v_{\\text{ext}} + v_H + v_{xc}$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^N \\varepsilon_i = T_s[n] + \\int v_{\\text{ext}}(\\mathbf{r}) n(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r} + \\int v_H(\\mathbf{r}) n(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r} + \\int v_{xc}(\\mathbf{r}) n(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r}\n$$\nThe exact total ground-state energy functional is:\n$$\nE[n] = T_s[n] + \\int v_{\\text{ext}}(\\mathbf{r}) n(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r} + E_H[n] + E_{xc}[n]\n$$\nHere, $E_H[n]$ is the Hartree energy, $E_H[n] = \\frac{1}{2}\\iint \\frac{n(\\mathbf{r})n(\\mathbf{r'})}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r'}|} d\\mathbf{r}d\\mathbf{r'} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int v_H(\\mathbf{r}) n(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r}$.\nComparing the two expressions, we see that the sum of eigenvalues contains the term $\\int v_H(\\mathbf{r}) n(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r} = 2E_H[n]$, while the total energy contains $E_H[n]$. This means the eigenvalue sum double-counts the classical electrostatic repulsion energy. Furthermore, the term $\\int v_{xc}(\\mathbf{r})n(\\mathbf{r})d\\mathbf{r}$ in the eigenvalue sum is not, in general, equal to the exchange-correlation energy $E_{xc}[n]$.\nThe correct relationship is:\n$$\nE[n] = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\varepsilon_i - E_H[n] - \\int v_{xc}(\\mathbf{r})n(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r} + E_{xc}[n]\n$$\nTherefore, the statement is incorrect.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",

Let $v_F(\\mathbf{r}) = \\delta F[n]/\\delta n(\\mathbf{r})$. Then at $\\gamma=1$:\n$$\\frac{d}{d\\gamma} F[n_\\gamma] \\bigg|_{\\gamma=1} = \\int v_F(\\mathbf{r}) [3n(\\mathbf{r}) + \\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\nabla n(\\mathbf{r})] d^3\\mathbf{r}$$\nEquating the LHS and RHS gives the general identity: $pF[n] = \\int v_F(\\mathbf{r}) [3n(\\mathbf{r}) + \\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\nabla n(\\mathbf{r})] d^3\\mathbf{r}$.\n\nFor the LDA exchange functional $E_x^{\\mathrm{LDA}}[n] = -A \\int n^{4/3} d^3\\mathbf{r}$:\n$$E_x^{\\mathrm{LDA}}[n_\\gamma] = -A \\int (\\gamma^3 n(\\gamma\\mathbf{r}))^{4/3} d^3\\mathbf{r} = -A \\gamma^4 \\int n(\\gamma\\mathbf{r})^{4/3} d^3\\mathbf{r}$$\nSubstituting $\\mathbf{u} = \\gamma\\mathbf{r}$, $d^3\\mathbf{r} = \\gamma^{-3}d^3\\mathbf{u}$:\n$$E_x^{\\mathrm{LDA}}[n_\\gamma] = -A \\gamma^4 \\gamma^{-3} \\int n(\\mathbf{u})^{4/3} d^3\\mathbf{u} = \\gamma E_x^{\\mathrm{LDA}}[n]$$\nThus, the LDA exchange functional is homogeneous of degree $p=1$. The corresponding exchange potential is $v_x(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{\\delta E_x^{\\mathrm{LDA}}[n]}{\\delta n(\\mathbf{r})} = -\\frac{4}{3} A n(\\mathbf{r})^{1/3}$.

Physical Virial Deviation**\n\nThe physical virial deviation at the variational optimum is defined as $\\delta_{\\mathrm{phys}} = 2 T_{W}[n_{\\kappa^{\\ast}}] + E_{\\mathrm{ext}}[n_{\\kappa^{\\ast}}]$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $T_W$ and $E_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ evaluated at $\\kappa=\\kappa^\\ast$:\n$$\\delta_{\\mathrm{phys}} = 2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(\\kappa^\\ast)^2\\right) + (-Z\\kappa^\\ast) = (\\kappa^\\ast)^2 - Z\\kappa^\\ast = \\kappa^\\ast(\\kappa^\\ast - Z)$$\nFrom the minimization result, we have $\\kappa^\\ast - Z = A \\frac{27}{64\\pi^{1/3}}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\delta_{\\mathrm{phys}}$:\n$$\\delta_{\\mathrm{phys}} = \\kappa^\\ast \\left( A \\frac{27}{64\\pi^{1/3}} \\right)$$\nNow we examine the relation to the exchange energy. The exchange energy at the optimum is:\n$$E_x^{\\mathrm{LDA}}[n_{\\kappa^\\ast}] = -A \\frac{27}{64\\pi^{1/3}}\\kappa^\\ast$$\nComparing these two expressions, we find a direct relationship:\n$$\\delta_{\\mathrm{phys}} = -E_x^{\\mathrm{LDA}}[n_{\\kappa^\\ast}]$$\nThis result also follows from the virial theorem for the approximate functional. Since $\\kappa$ is a scaling parameter, the minimization condition $\\frac{dE}{d\\kappa}|_{\\kappa^\\ast}=0$ implies that the virial theorem for the total approximate functional must hold: $2T_W[n_{\\kappa^\\ast}] + E_{\\mathrm{ext}}[n_{\\kappa^\\ast}] + E_x^{\\mathrm{LDA}}[n_{\\kappa^\\ast}] = 0$. Rearranging gives $\\delta_{\\mathrm{phys}} = -E_x^{\\mathrm{LDA}}[n_{\\kappa^\\ast}]$ immediately.\n\nTo obtain the final closed-form expression for $\\delta_{\\mathrm{phys}}$, we substitute the explicit form of the constants.\nLet the coefficient be $C_x = A \\frac{27}{64\\pi^{1/3}}$. With $A = \\frac{3}{4}\\left(\\frac{3}{\\pi}\\right)^{1/3}$:\n$$C_x = \\frac{3}{4} \\frac{3^{1/3}}{\\pi^{1/3}} \\frac{27}{64\\pi^{1/3}} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 3^{1/3} \\cdot 3^3}{4 \\cdot 64 \\cdot \\pi^{2/3}} = \\frac{3^{4+1/3}}{256\\pi^{2/3}} = \\frac{3^{13/3}}{256\\pi^{2/3}}$$\nThen $\\kappa^\\ast = Z + C_x$, and the deviation is:\n$$\\delta_{\\mathrm{phys}} = -E_x^{\\mathrm{LDA}}[n_{\\kappa^\\ast}] = C_x \\kappa^\\ast = C_x (Z + C_x)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_x$:\n$$\\delta_{\\mathrm{phys}} = \\frac{3^{13/3}}{256\\pi^{2/3}} \\left( Z + \\frac{3^{13/3}}{256\\pi^{2/3}} \\right)$$\nThis is the final expression for the physical virial deviation in Hartree atomic units.",

The given definitions and tasks are scientifically grounded in established principles of quantum mechanics and numerical analysis, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nWe proceed by addressing the three tasks outlined in the problem statement, which will provide the necessary framework to evaluate the given options.\n\n### Task 1: SCF Iteration, Residual, and Mixing Schemes\n\nThe ground state of an electronic system is found by minimizing the total energy functional $E[n]$ with respect to the electron density $n(\\mathbf{r})$, subject to the constraint that the density integrates to the total number of electrons, $N$. The Kohn-Sham (KS) construction achieves this by introducing a fictitious non-interacting system that reproduces the ground-state density of the real, interacting system. This auxiliary system is governed by the single-particle KS equations:\n$$\n\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^{2} + v_{s}[n](\\mathbf{r})\\right)\\varphi_{i}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\varepsilon_{i}\\,\\varphi_{i}(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nThe crucial point is that the effective potential, $v_{s}[n]$, itself depends on the density $n$. This self-consistency requirement naturally leads to an iterative solution.\n\nStarting with an initial trial density $n^{(k)}(\\mathbf{r})$ at iteration $k$, one performs the following steps:\n1.  Construct the KS potential: $v_{s}[n^{(k)}](\\mathbf{r}) = v_{\\mathrm{ext}}(\\mathbf{r}) + v_{H}[n^{(k)}](\\mathbf{r}) + v_{\\mathrm{xc}}[n^{(k)}](\\mathbf{r})$.\n2.  Solve the KS equations for this potential to obtain a new set of orbitals $\\{\\varphi_i\\}$.\n3.  Construct an output density from these orbitals: $n_{\\mathrm{out}}^{(k)}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} |\\varphi_{i}(\\mathbf{r})|^{2}$.\n\nThis sequence of operations constitutes the Kohn-Sham map, $\\mathcal{F}$, which takes an input density $n^{(k)}$ and produces an output density $n_{\\mathrm{out}}^{(k)}$:\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{out}}^{(k)} = \\mathcal{F}[n^{(k)}]\n$$\nThe goal is to find a fixed point of this map, $n^{\\star}$, such that $n^{\\star} = \\mathcal{F}[n^{\\star}]$. The simplest iterative approach, known as simple iteration or Picard iteration, is to use the output density of one iteration as the input for the next:\n$$\nn^{(k+1)} = \\mathcal{F}[n^{(k)}]\n$$\nThis is the formal fixed-point iteration.\n\nThe residual at iteration $k$, denoted $r^{(k)}(\\mathbf{r})$, is defined as the difference between the output and input densities:\n$$\nr^{(k)}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\mathcal{F}[n^{(k)}](\\mathbf{r}) - n^{(k)}(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nAt convergence, $n^{(k)} \\to n^{\\star}$ and thus $r^{(k)}(\\mathbf{r}) \\to 0$.\n\nSimple iteration often converges poorly or diverges. Density mixing schemes are improved methods for generating the next trial density $n^{(k+1)}$. They can be interpreted as residual-based updates because they use the residual $r^{(k)}$ to guide the update from $n^{(k)}$ to $n^{(k+1)}$, aiming for a better guess that is closer to the fixed point. For example, the linear mixing scheme updates the density via $n^{(k+1)} = n^{(k)} + \\alpha r^{(k)}$, where $\\alpha$ is a mixing parameter. This takes the current guess and adds a fraction of the correction indicated by the residual. More advanced methods use a history of residuals to construct a more sophisticated update.\n\n### Task 2: Linearization of Linear Mixing\n\nThe linear mixing update is given by:\n$$\nn^{(k+1)} = n^{(k)} + \\alpha\\,r^{(k)} = n^{(k)} + \\alpha(\\mathcal{F}[n^{(k)}] - n^{(k)})\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\nn^{(k+1)} = (1 - \\alpha) n^{(k)} + \\alpha \\mathcal{F}[n^{(k)}]\n$$\nTo analyze local convergence, we investigate the behavior of the error, $e^{(k)} = n^{(k)} - n^{\\star}$, near the fixed point $n^{\\star}$. We substitute $n^{(k)} = n^{\\star} + e^{(k)}$ into the update equation. The left side becomes $n^{(k+1)} = n^{\\star} + e^{(k+1)}$. For the right side, we use the Fréchet derivative $\\mathcal{F}'[n^{\\star}]$ to linearize the map $\\mathcal{F}$ around $n^{\\star}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}[n^{(k)}] = \\mathcal{F}[n^{\\star} + e^{(k)}] \\approx \\mathcal{F}[n^{\\star}] + \\mathcal{F}'[n^{\\star}] e^{(k)}\n$$\nSince $n^{\\star}$ is a fixed point, $\\mathcal{F}[n^{\\star}] = n^{\\star}$. Thus, $\\mathcal{F}[n^{(k)}] \\approx n^{\\star} + \\mathcal{F}'[n^{\\star}] e^{(k)}$.\nSubstituting these into the update rule:\n$$\nn^{\\star} + e^{(k+1)} \\approx (1 - \\alpha)(n^{\\star} + e^{(k)}) + \\alpha(n^{\\star} + \\mathcal{F}'[n^{\\star}] e^{(k)})\n$$\n$$\nn^{\\star} + e^{(k+1)} \\approx [(1 - \\alpha) + \\alpha]n^{\\star} + (1 - \\alpha)e^{(k)} + \\alpha\\mathcal{F}'[n^{\\star}] e^{(k)}\n$$\n$$\ne^{(k+1)} \\approx \\left[(1 - \\alpha)I + \\alpha\\mathcal{F}'[n^{\\star}]\\right] e^{(k)}\n$$\nThis is the linearized error propagation equation. The iteration operator is $M = (1 - \\alpha)I + \\alpha\\mathcal{F}'[n^{\\star}]$. For the iteration to converge locally (i.e., for the error $e^{(k)}$ to approach zero), the spectral radius of $M$ must be less than $1$. The eigenvalues of $M$, let's call them $\\mu$, are related to the eigenvalues of the Fréchet derivative $\\mathcal{F}'[n^{\\star}]$, let's call them $\\lambda$. If $x$ is an eigenvector of $\\mathcal{F}'[n^{\\star}]$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda$, then $Mx = (1 - \\alpha)x + \\alpha\\lambda x = ((1 - \\alpha) + \\alpha\\lambda)x$. So, $\\mu = (1 - \\alpha) + \\alpha\\lambda$. The local convergence condition is that for every eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of $\\mathcal{F}'[n^{\\star}]$, the magnitude of the corresponding eigenvalue of $M$ must be less than $1$:\n$$\n|(1 - \\alpha) + \\alpha\\lambda| < 1\n$$\n\n### Task 3: Pulay Mixing (DIIS)\n\nPulay mixing, or DIIS (Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace), aims to find the optimal linear combination of previous iterates that minimizes the corresponding residual. We seek coefficients $\\{c_i\\}$ for $i=0, \\dots, m$ that solve the constrained minimization problem:\n$$\n\\min_{\\{c_i\\}} \\left\\| \\sum_{i=0}^{m} c_{i}\\,r^{(k-i)} \\right\\|^2 \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad \\sum_{i=0}^{m} c_{i} = 1\n$$\nWe use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The objective function is:\n$$\nL(\\{c_i\\}, \\mu) = \\left\\langle \\sum_{i=0}^{m} c_{i}\\,r^{(k-i)}, \\sum_{j=0}^{m} c_{j}\\,r^{(k-j)} \\right\\rangle - 2\\mu \\left( \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{m} c_{i}\\right) - 1 \\right)\n$$\nwhere $2\\mu$ is the Lagrange multiplier. The objective can be written as $L = \\sum_{i,j=0}^m c_i c_j \\langle r^{(k-i)}, r^{(k-j)} \\rangle - 2\\mu(\\sum_i c_i - 1)$.\nLet $B_{ij} = \\langle r^{(k-i)}, r^{(k-j)} \\rangle$ be the matrix elements of the Gram matrix of the residuals.\n$$\nL = \\sum_{i=0}^{m}\\sum_{j=0}^{m} c_i c_j B_{ij} - 2\\mu \\left( \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{m} c_{i}\\right) - 1 \\right)\n$$\nTo find the minimum, we set the partial derivatives with respect to each coefficient $c_l$ to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial c_l} = \\sum_{j=0}^{m} 2 c_j B_{lj} - 2\\mu = 0 \\quad \\text{for } l = 0, \\dots, m\n$$\nThis simplifies to the following system of linear equations, known as the normal equations:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=0}^{m} B_{lj} c_j = \\mu \\quad \\text{for } l = 0, \\dots, m\n$$\nThese $m+1$ equations, along with the constraint $\\sum_{j=0}^{m} c_j = 1$, form a linear system of $m+2$ equations for the $m+1$ coefficients $\\{c_j\\}$ and the Lagrange multiplier $\\mu$. The matrix elements that appear are the inner products of the residual vectors from the last $m+1$ iterations, $B_{ij} = \\langle r^{(k-i)}, r^{(k-j)} \\rangle$.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The Kohn–Sham map $\\mathcal{F}[n]$ is obtained by computing $v_{s}[n] = v_{\\mathrm{ext}} + v_{H}[n] + v_{\\mathrm{xc}}[n]$, solving the single-particle Kohn–Sham equations for the orbitals $\\{\\varphi_{i}\\}$, and forming the output density from the occupied orbitals; the fixed-point iteration $n^{(k+1)} = \\mathcal{F}[n^{(k)}]$ relaxes the trial density toward self-consistency via this map.**\nThis statement is a correct and precise summary of the definition of the Kohn-Sham map and the simple fixed-point iteration scheme derived in Task 1.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Under linearization around $n^{\\star}$, the linear mixing update $n^{(k+1)} = n^{(k)} + \\alpha\\,r^{(k)}$ yields the error propagation $e^{(k+1)} \\approx \\left[(1 - \\alpha)\\,I + \\alpha\\,\\mathcal{F}'[n^{\\star}]\\right] e^{(k)}$, so local convergence requires that for every eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of $\\mathcal{F}'[n^{\\star}]$, one has $\\left|(1 - \\alpha) + \\alpha\\,\\lambda\\right| < 1$.**\nThis statement matches our derivation in Task 2 exactly. The error propagation formula and the condition on the eigenvalues for local convergence are derived correctly from the linearization of the linear mixing update rule.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. In Pulay mixing, the coefficients $\\{c_{i}\\}$ are obtained by minimizing the norm of the mixed residual $\\left\\|\\sum_{i=0}^{m} c_{i}\\,r^{(k-i)}\\right\\|$ subject to $\\sum_{i=0}^{m} c_{i} = 1$, leading to the linear system $\\sum_{j=0}^{m} B_{ij}\\,c_{j} = \\mu$ for $i = 0,\\dots,m$, with $B_{ij} = \\langle r^{(k-i)}, r^{(k-j)}\\rangle$ and a Lagrange multiplier $\\mu$ enforcing the normalization constraint.**\nThis statement accurately describes the DIIS procedure as a constrained optimization problem and correctly identifies the resulting normal equations and the definition of the matrix elements involved, as derived in Task 3.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Linear mixing is equivalent to applying Newton’s method to solve $r(n) = 0$ with the exact Jacobian and therefore achieves quadratic convergence in the vicinity of $n^{\\star}$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Newton's method for solving $r(n) = \\mathcal{F}[n] - n = 0$ would be $n^{(k+1)} = n^{(k)} - [r'(n^{(k)})]^{-1}r(n^{(k)})$, where the Jacobian is $r'(n) = \\mathcal{F}'[n] - I$. Linear mixing, $n^{(k+1)} = n^{(k)} + \\alpha r(n^{(k)})$, corresponds to a quasi-Newton method with a very crude approximation of the inverse Jacobian, $[r'(n)]^{-1} \\approx -\\alpha I$. It is not equivalent to Newton's method. Furthermore, linear mixing exhibits linear convergence, not the quadratic convergence characteristic of Newton's method.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Because Pulay mixing minimizes a residual norm at each step, it guarantees that the Kohn–Sham total energy $E[n^{(k)}]$ decreases monotonically with $k$ for any choice of inner product and any system.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Pulay mixing (DIIS) is an algorithm designed to accelerate convergence to a fixed point $n^{\\star}$ by minimizing the norm of a residual vector $r(n) = \\mathcal{F}[n] - n$. It is not an energy minimization algorithm. The path of the iterates $n^{(k)}$ through the space of densities does not necessarily correspond to a path of decreasing energy $E[n]$. In practice, the total energy during an SCF cycle with DIIS often oscillates and may increase before converging. A guarantee of monotonic energy decrease would require an algorithm designed to minimize the energy functional directly, which DIIS is not.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
