This exercise provides a direct feel for the potential energy landscape by calculating its value at several key dimensionless distances. By engaging with the functional form directly, you will explore the balance between the steep short-range repulsion, governed by the $(\\sigma/r)^{12}$ term, and the gentler long-range attraction from the $(\\sigma/r)^{6}$ term, building a concrete understanding of the potential's shape .",

            "problem": "Consider a system of two identical, spherically symmetric particles interacting via a pair potential that depends only on their separation distance. In classical mechanics, the total potential energy for such a pair is defined by a scalar function of the separation distance. A widely used model for short-range repulsion and long-range dispersion attraction is the Lennard-Jones pair potential, defined by\n$$U(r) = 4 \\epsilon \\left[\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{6}\\right],$$\nwhere $r$ is the center-to-center distance, $\\epsilon$ sets the energy scale, and $\\sigma$ sets the characteristic length scale at which the repulsive and attractive contributions balance in sign. In the context of multiscale modeling and analysis, it is often advantageous to non-dimensionalize energies and distances. Define the dimensionless potential $U(r)/\\epsilon$ and the reduced distance $s = r/\\sigma$.\n\nTask: Using only the definition above and first-principles reasoning about non-dimensionalization, compute the dimensionless values $U(r)/\\epsilon$ for $s = r/\\sigma \\in \\{0.9, 1.0, 1.1225, 2.0\\}$. In your reasoning, interpret the relative magnitude of the repulsive contribution and the attractive contribution at each distance by comparing the terms $\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{12}$ and $\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{6}$. Express the final numerical results as an ordered row matrix in the same order of $s$ values, rounded to four significant figures. The final answer is dimensionless; do not include units.",
            "solution": "The Lennard-Jones pair potential is given by the expression:\n$$U(r) = 4 \\epsilon \\left[\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{6}\\right]$$\nHere, $U(r)$ is the potential energy as a function of the interparticle distance $r$. The parameter $\\epsilon$ represents the depth of the potential well, and $\\sigma$ is the finite distance at which the inter-particle potential is zero.\n\nThe task is to non-dimensionalize the potential and distance. The dimensionless potential is defined as $U^*(s) = U(r)/\\epsilon$, and the reduced distance is $s = r/\\sigma$. We can rewrite the Lennard-Jones potential in terms of these dimensionless quantities.\nFirst, note that the ratio $\\sigma/r$ can be expressed in terms of $s$:\n$$s = \\frac{r}{\\sigma} \\implies \\frac{1}{s} = \\frac{\\sigma}{r}$$\nSubstituting this into the potential equation and dividing by $\\epsilon$ yields the dimensionless potential $U^*(s)$:\n$$\\frac{U(r)}{\\epsilon} = 4 \\left[\\left(\\frac{1}{s}\\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{1}{s}\\right)^{6}\\right]$$\n$$U^*(s) = 4 \\left[s^{-12} - s^{-6}\\right]$$\nIn this form, the term $4 s^{-12}$ represents the short-range repulsive contribution, while the term $-4 s^{-6}$ represents the longer-range attractive contribution. The relative magnitude of these interactions is determined by the values of $s^{-12}$ and $s^{-6}$. We will now evaluate $U^*(s)$ for the specified values of $s$.\n\nCase 1: $s = 0.9$\nThis corresponds to a distance $r$ that is $0.9$ times the characteristic length $\\sigma$, i.e., $r  \\sigma$.\nThe repulsive and attractive components are proportional to:\n$$s^{-12} = (0.9)^{-12} \\approx 3.54069$$\n$$s^{-6} = (0.9)^{-6} \\approx 1.88168$$\nSince $s  1$, we have $s^{-1} > 1$. Consequently, $s^{-12} > s^{-6}$. The repulsive term's magnitude is greater than the attractive term's magnitude. This results in a net repulsive force and a positive potential energy.\nThe dimensionless potential is:\n$$U^*(0.9) = 4 \\left[ (0.9)^{-12} - (0.9)^{-6} \\right] \\approx 4 [3.54069 - 1.88168] = 4 [1.65901] \\approx 6.63604$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $6.636$.\n\nCase 2: $s = 1.0$\nThis corresponds to the distance $r = \\sigma$.\nThe repulsive and attractive components are proportional to:\n$$s^{-12} = (1.0)^{-12} = 1$$\n$$s^{-6} = (1.0)^{-6} = 1$$\nAt this specific distance, the magnitudes of the repulsive and attractive terms are exactly equal, and they cancel each other.\nThe dimensionless potential is:\n$$U^*(1.0) = 4 \\left[ (1.0)^{-12} - (1.0)^{-6} \\right] = 4 [1 - 1] = 0$$\nThe result is exactly $0$. For consistency with the required formatting, we can write this as $0.000$.\n\nCase 3: $s = 1.1225$\nThis distance is slightly greater than $\\sigma$. We note that the minimum of the Lennard-Jones potential occurs at $r_m = 2^{1/6} \\sigma$, which corresponds to $s_m = 2^{1/6} \\approx 1.12246$. The given value of $s = 1.1225$ is a very close approximation to this minimum.\nThe repulsive and attractive components are proportional to:\n$$s^{-12} = (1.1225)^{-12} \\approx 0.249977$$\n$$s^{-6} = (1.1225)^{-6} \\approx 0.499977$$\nSince $s > 1$, we have $s^{-1}  1$. Consequently, $s^{-12}  s^{-6}$. The attractive term's magnitude is greater than the repulsive term's magnitude. This results in a net attractive force and a negative potential energy.\nThe dimensionless potential is:\n$$U^*(1.1225) = 4 \\left[ (1.1225)^{-12} - (1.1225)^{-6} \\right] \\approx 4 [0.249977 - 0.499977] = 4 [-0.250000] = -1.0000$$\nAt the exact minimum ($s_m=2^{1/6}$), the potential is $U^*(s_m) = 4[(2^{1/6})^{-12} - (2^{1/6})^{-6}] = 4[2^{-2} - 2^{-1}] = 4[1/4 - 1/2] = 4[-1/4] = -1$. Because the given value $s=1.1225$ is so close to the true minimum, the calculated potential is also extremely close to $-1$.\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $-1.000$.\n\nCase 4: $s = 2.0$\nThis corresponds to a distance $r = 2\\sigma$, a significantly larger separation.\nThe repulsive and attractive components are proportional to:\n$$s^{-12} = (2.0)^{-12} = \\frac{1}{4096} \\approx 0.00024414$$\n$$s^{-6} = (2.0)^{-6} = \\frac{1}{64} = 0.015625$$\nAs in the previous case, $s > 1$, so $s^{-12}  s^{-6}$. The attractive term's magnitude dominates. However, both terms are small, indicating the interaction is weak at this distance. The potential is attractive but approaches zero as $s$ increases.\nThe dimensionless potential is:\n$$U^*(2.0) = 4 \\left[ (2.0)^{-12} - (2.0)^{-6} \\right] = 4 \\left[ \\frac{1}{4096} - \\frac{1}{64} \\right] = 4 \\left[ \\frac{1 - 64}{4096} \\right] = 4 \\left[ -\\frac{63}{4096} \\right] = -\\frac{63}{1024} = -0.0615234375$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $-0.06152$.\n\nThe final numerical results for $U(r)/\\epsilon$ at $s \\in \\{0.9, 1.0, 1.1225, 2.0\\}$, rounded to four significant figures, are assembled into an ordered row matrix.",

To satisfy four independent conditions, we need at least a polynomial with four free coefficients. A cubic polynomial of the form $P(t) = at^3 + bt^2 + ct + d$ has four coefficients ($a, b, c, d$), so the minimal degree is $3$.\n\nTo simplify the algebra, we introduce a normalized dimensionless variable $x$ that maps the interval $[r_s, r_c]$ to $[0, 1]$. Let\n$$\nx = \\frac{r - r_s}{r_c - r_s}\n$$\nThis implies that when $r = r_s$, $x=0$, and when $r = r_c$, $x=1$. We can express $S(r)$ as a polynomial $P(x)$ in this new variable. The conditions on $S(r)$ transform into conditions on $P(x)$:\n1. $S(r_s)=1 \\implies P(0)=1$.\n2. $S(r_c)=0 \\implies P(1)=0$.\n\nFor the derivative conditions, we use the chain rule: $S'(r) = \\frac{dP}{dx} \\frac{dx}{dr}$.\nSince $\\frac{dx}{dr} = \\frac{1}{r_c - r_s}$, we have $P'(x) \\equiv \\frac{dP}{dx} = S'(r)(r_c - r_s)$.\nThe derivative conditions on $S(r)$ become:\n3. $S'(r_s)=0 \\implies P'(0) = S'(r_s)(r_c-r_s) = 0$.\n4. $S'(r_c)=0 \\implies P'(1) = S'(r_c)(r_c-r_s) = 0$.\n\nWe seek the cubic polynomial $P(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ satisfying these four simplified conditions on the interval $[0, 1]$.

By construction, $S(r_s)=1$ and $S'(r_s)=0$. This simplifies to $V'_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r_s)$, which matches the derivative for $r  r_s$.\nAt $r=r_c$, the derivative approaches $S'(r_c)V_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r_c) + S(r_c)V'_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r_c)$ from the left. By construction, $S(r_c)=0$ and $S'(r_c)=0$.
