This is a standard and well-established technique in applied mathematics and physics. The model represents a system with linear growth counteracted by a weak quadratic damping, a common motif in population dynamics and reaction kinetics.

All necessary information (the ODE, the initial condition, the form of the expansion) is provided. The requirement to \"impose initial conditions consistent with $y(0) = 1$\" implies a standard procedure in perturbation theory, which is not an omission but a directive to apply established methodology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard, well-posed problem in perturbation methods. A solution will be constructed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe governing differential equation is\n$$y'(t) - y(t) + \\epsilon y(t)^2 = 0$$\nwith the initial condition $y(0) = 1$. We seek a solution in the form of a regular perturbation expansion in the small parameter $\\epsilon$:\n$$y(t;\\epsilon) = y_{0}(t) + \\epsilon y_{1}(t) + \\epsilon^2 y_{2}(t) + \\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^3)$$\nThe derivative is given by:\n$$y'(t;\\epsilon) = y'_{0}(t) + \\epsilon y'_{1}(t) + \\epsilon^2 y'_{2}(t) + \\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^3)$$\nThe nonlinear term $y(t)^2$ is expanded as:\n$$y(t)^2 = \\left(y_{0} + \\epsilon y_{1} + \\epsilon^2 y_{2} + \\dots \\right)^2 = y_{0}^2 + 2\\epsilon y_{0}y_{1} + \\epsilon^2(y_{1}^2 + 2y_{0}y_{2}) + \\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^3)$$\nSubstituting these expansions into the original differential equation yields:\n$$ \\left( y'_{0} + \\epsilon y'_{1} + \\epsilon^2 y'_{2} \\right) - \\left( y_{0} + \\epsilon y_{1} + \\epsilon^2 y_{2} \\right) + \\epsilon \\left( y_{0}^2 + 2\\epsilon y_{0}y_{1} \\right) + \\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^3) = 0 $$\nRe-grouping the terms by powers of $\\epsilon$:\n$$ \\left( y'_{0} - y_{0} \\right) + \\epsilon \\left( y'_{1} - y_{1} + y_{0}^2 \\right) + \\epsilon^2 \\left( y'_{2} - y_{2} + 2y_{0}y_{1} \\right) + \\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^3) = 0 $$\nFor this equation to hold for any small $\\epsilon$, the coefficient of each power of $\\epsilon$ must be zero. This gives a hierarchy of linear ordinary differential equations.\n\nThe initial condition $y(0) = 1$ must also be satisfied order by order:\n$$ y(0) = y_{0}(0) + \\epsilon y_{1}(0) + \\epsilon^2 y_{2}(0) + \\dots = 1 $$\nThis implies the following initial conditions for the hierarchy:\n$$ y_{0}(0) = 1 $$\n$$ y_{n}(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } n \\ge 1 $$\n\nWe now solve the hierarchy of problems sequentially.\n\n**Order $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^0)$ Problem:**\nThe equation is:\n$$ y'_{0}(t) - y_{0}(t) = 0 $$\nwith the initial condition $y_{0}(0) = 1$. The general solution is $y_{0}(t) = C_{0} \\exp(t)$. Applying the initial condition: $y_{0}(0) = C_{0}\\exp(0) = C_{0} = 1$.\nThus, the zeroth-order solution is:\n$$ y_{0}(t) = \\exp(t) $$\n\n**Order $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^1)$ Problem:**\nThe equation is:\n$$ y'_{1}(t) - y_{1}(t) + y_{0}(t)^2 = 0 \\implies y'_{1}(t) - y_{1}(t) = -y_{0}(t)^2 $$\nSubstituting the solution for $y_{0}(t)$:\n$$ y'_{1}(t) - y_{1}(t) = -(\\exp(t))^2 = -\\exp(2t) $$\nThis is a linear first-order inhomogeneous ODE. The initial condition is $y_{1}(0) = 0$. We solve using an integrating factor $I(t) = \\exp\\left(\\int -1 \\, dt\\right) = \\exp(-t)$.\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\left( \\exp(-t) y_{1}(t) \\right) = \\exp(-t) (-\\exp(2t)) = -\\exp(t) $$\nIntegrating with respect to $t$:\n$$ \\exp(-t) y_{1}(t) = \\int -\\exp(t) \\, dt = -\\exp(t) + C_{1} $$\nThe general solution for $y_{1}(t)$ is $y_{1}(t) = -\\exp(2t) + C_{1}\\exp(t)$.\nApplying the initial condition $y_{1}(0) = 0$:\n$$ y_{1}(0) = -\\exp(0) + C_{1}\\exp(0) = -1 + C_{1} = 0 \\implies C_{1} = 1 $$\nThus, the first-order correction is:\n$$ y_{1}(t) = \\exp(t) - \\exp(2t) = \\exp(t)(1 - \\exp(t)) $$\n\n**Order $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^2)$ Problem:**\nThe equation is:\n$$ y'_{2}(t) - y_{2}(t) + 2y_{0}(t)y_{1}(t) = 0 \\implies y'_{2}(t) - y_{2}(t) = -2y_{0}(t)y_{1}(t) $$\nThe initial condition is $y_{2}(0) = 0$. Substituting the expressions for $y_{0}(t)$ and $y_{1}(t)$:\n$$ -2y_{0}(t)y_{1}(t) = -2\\exp(t)(\\exp(t) - \\exp(2t)) = -2\\exp(2t) + 2\\exp(3t) $$\nThe ODE for $y_{2}(t)$ is:\n$$ y'_{2}(t) - y_{2}(t) = -2\\exp(2t) + 2\\exp(3t) $$\nUsing the same integrating factor $I(t) = \\exp(-t)$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\left( \\exp(-t) y_{2}(t) \\right) = \\exp(-t)(-2\\exp(2t) + 2\\exp(3t)) = -2\\exp(t) + 2\\exp(2t) $$\nIntegrating with respect to $t$:\n$$ \\exp(-t) y_{2}(t) = \\int (-2\\exp(t) + 2\\exp(2t)) \\, dt = -2\\exp(t) + \\exp(2t) + C_{2} $$\nThe general solution for $y_{2}(t)$ is $y_{2}(t) = -2\\exp(2t) + \\exp(3t) + C_{2}\\exp(t)$.\nApplying the initial condition $y_{2}(0) = 0$:\n$$ y_{2}(0) = -2\\exp(0) + \\exp(0) + C_{2}\\exp(0) = -2 + 1 + C_{2} = 0 \\implies C_{2} = 1 $$\nThus, the second-order correction is:\n$$ y_{2}(t) = \\exp(t) - 2\\exp(2t) + \\exp(3t) = \\exp(t)(1 - 2\\exp(t) + \\exp(2t)) = \\exp(t)(1-\\exp(t))^2 $$\n\n**Composite Approximation:**\nThe solution accurate to order $\\epsilon^2$ is constructed by summing the determined components:\n$$ y(t;\\epsilon) \\approx y_{0}(t) + \\epsilon y_{1}(t) + \\epsilon^2 y_{2}(t) $$\n$$ y(t;\\epsilon) \\approx \\exp(t) + \\epsilon \\left( \\exp(t) - \\exp(2t) \\right) + \\epsilon^2 \\left( \\exp(t) - 2\\exp(2t) + \\exp(3t) \\right) $$\nFactoring out the common term $\\exp(t)$:\n$$ y(t;\\epsilon) \\approx \\exp(t) \\left[ 1 + \\epsilon(1 - \\exp(t)) + \\epsilon^2(1 - \\exp(t))^2 \\right] $$\nThis provides the final analytical expression for the approximation.",

Thus, as $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the term $-\\epsilon u''(x)$ is asymptotically smaller than $u'(x)$. The reduced equation, obtained by setting $\\epsilon=0$, governs the leading-order outer solution $u_{out}(x)$.\n$$u_{out}'(x) = 1$$\nIntegrating this first-order ODE yields\n$$u_{out}(x) = x + C_1$$\nwhere $C_1$ is an integration constant. This solution cannot satisfy both boundary conditions simultaneously, which indicates the presence of at least one boundary layer where the neglected term $-\\epsilon u''(x)$ becomes significant.\n\n**Boundary Layer Analysis and Location**\n\nA boundary layer is a narrow region where the solution changes rapidly. In this region, the highest derivative term, which was neglected, becomes comparable to other terms in the equation. This is the principle of dominant balance. Let us investigate the possibility of a boundary layer at each endpoint.\n\nCase 1: Boundary layer at $x=0$.\nLet's introduce a stretched inner coordinate $X = x/\\delta(\\epsilon)$. The derivatives transform as $\\frac{d}{dx} = \\frac{1}{\\delta}\\frac{d}{dX}$ and $\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} = \\frac{1}{\\delta^2}\\frac{d^2}{dX^2}$. Let $u(x) = U(X)$. The ODE becomes:\n$$-\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\delta^2} \\frac{d^2U}{dX^2} + \\frac{1}{\\delta} \\frac{dU}{dX} = 1$$\nFor dominant balance between the two derivative terms, we must have $\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\delta^2} \\sim \\frac{1}{\\delta}$, which implies $\\delta \\sim \\epsilon$. We choose $\\delta=\\epsilon$, so the inner variable is $X=x/\\epsilon$. The ODE in the inner coordinate is:\n$$-\\frac{d^2U}{dX^2} + \\frac{dU}{dX} = \\epsilon$$\nThe leading-order inner equation is obtained by setting $\\epsilon=0$:\n$$-\\frac{d^2U_0}{dX^2} + \\frac{dU_0}{dX} = 0$$\nThe general solution is $U_0(X) = A + B\\exp(X)$. For a boundary layer to exist at $x=0$, the solution must be bounded as we move away from the boundary into the outer region, i.e., as $X \\to \\infty$. The term $\\exp(X)$ grows unboundedly as $X \\to \\infty$. This is not characteristic of a boundary layer phenomenon, which should be localized. Therefore, a boundary layer does not exist at $x=0$.\n\nCase 2: Boundary layer at $x=1$.\nWe introduce a stretched inner coordinate centered at $x=1$: $X = (1-x)/\\delta(\\epsilon)$. The derivatives transform as $\\frac{d}{dx} = -\\frac{1}{\\delta}\\frac{d}{dX}$ and $\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} = \\frac{1}{\\delta^2}\\frac{d^2}{dX^2}$. Let $u(x)=U(X)$. The ODE becomes:\n$$-\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\delta^2} \\frac{d^2U}{dX^2} - \\frac{1}{\\delta} \\frac{dU}{dX} = 1$$\nDominant balance between the two derivative terms requires $\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\delta^2} \\sim \\frac{1}{\\delta}$, which again implies $\\delta \\sim \\epsilon$. We set $\\delta=\\epsilon$, so the inner variable is $X=(1-x)/\\epsilon$. The ODE is:\n$$-\\frac{d^2U}{dX^2} - \\frac{dU}{dX} = \\epsilon$$\nThe leading-order inner equation is:\n$$\\frac{d^2U_0}{dX^2} + \\frac{dU_0}{dX} = 0$$\nThe general solution is $U_0(X) = A + B\\exp(-X)$. As $X \\to \\infty$ (i.e., as $x$ moves away from $1$ into the interior), the term $\\exp(-X)$ decays to zero. This is consistent with a localized boundary layer. Thus, the boundary layer is located at $x=1$.\n\n**Determination of Solutions and Matching**\n\nThe outer solution $u_{out}(x) = x + C_1$ must be valid away from the boundary layer at $x=1$. Therefore, it should satisfy the boundary condition at the other end, $x=0$.\n$$u_{out}(0) = 0 \\implies 0 + C_1 = 0 \\implies C_1 = 0$$\nSo, the leading-order outer solution is\n$$u_{out}(x) = x$$\n\nThe leading-order inner solution is $U_0(X) = A + B\\exp(-X)$. It must satisfy the boundary condition at $x=1$, which is $u(1)=0$. In the inner coordinate, $x=1$ corresponds to $X=0$.\n$$U_0(0) = 0 \\implies A + B\\exp(0) = 0 \\implies A+B=0 \\implies B = -A$$\nSo, the inner solution takes the form $U_0(X) = A(1 - \\exp(-X))$.\n\nThe constant $A$ is determined by matching the inner and outer solutions. According to the Van Dyke matching principle, the long-range behavior of the inner solution must match the short-range behavior of the outer solution.\n$$\\lim_{X \\to \\infty} U_0(X) = \\lim_{x \\to 1} u_{out}(x)$$\nWe compute the limits:\n$$\\lim_{X \\to \\infty} A(1 - \\exp(-X)) = A(1-0) = A$$\n$$\\lim_{x \\to 1} x = 1$$\nMatching these values gives $A=1$.\nThus, the leading-order inner solution in terms of the inner variable $X$ is\n$$U_0(X) = 1 - \\exp(-X)$$\nSubstituting $X=(1-x)/\\epsilon$, we get the inner solution in terms of the outer variable $x$:\n$$u_{in}(x) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1-x}{\\epsilon}\\right)$$\n\n**Uniform Composite Approximation**\n\nA leading-order uniform composite approximation $u_{\\mathrm{comp}}(x)$ can be constructed by adding the outer and inner solutions and subtracting their common part to avoid double-counting. The common part, $u_{\\mathrm{common}}$, is the value found during matching.\n$$u_{\\mathrm{comp}}(x) = u_{out}(x) + u_{in}(x) - u_{\\mathrm{common}}(x)$$\nHere, $u_{out}(x) = x$, $u_{in}(x) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1-x}{\\epsilon}\\right)$, and the common matching value is $u_{\\mathrm{common}} = 1$.\nSubstituting these into the formula:\n$$u_{\\mathrm{comp}}(x) = x + \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1-x}{\\epsilon}\\right)\\right) - 1$$\n$$u_{\\mathrm{comp}}(x) = x - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1-x}{\\epsilon}\\right)$$\nThis expression serves as a uniformly valid approximation to the solution over the entire domain $0 \\le x \\le 1$.",

The solvability condition requires that the coefficients of these resonant terms on the right-hand side must be zero.\n\nLet us evaluate the terms on the right-hand side (RHS).\nFor the first term, we need the derivatives of $x_{0}$:\n$$\nD_{0} x_{0} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T_{0}} \\left[ a(T_{1}) \\cos(T_{0} + \\theta(T_{1})) \\right] = -a(T_{1}) \\sin(T_{0} + \\theta(T_{1}))\n$$\n$$\nD_{1} x_{0} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T_{1}} \\left[ a(T_{1}) \\cos(T_{0} + \\theta(T_{1})) \\right] = \\frac{da}{dT_{1}} \\cos(T_{0} + \\theta(T_{1})) - a(T_{1}) \\frac{d\\theta}{dT_{1}} \\sin(T_{0} + \\theta(T_{1}))\n$$\nUsing primes to denote differentiation with respect to $T_{1}$, i.e., $a' = da/dT_{1}$ and $\\theta' = d\\theta/dT_{1}$:\n$$\nD_{1} x_{0} = a' \\cos(T_{0} + \\theta) - a \\theta' \\sin(T_{0} + \\theta)\n$$\nNow we can compute $-2D_{0}D_{1}x_{0}$:\n$$\n-2 D_{0}D_{1}x_{0} = -2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T_{0}} \\left[ a' \\cos(T_{0} + \\theta) - a \\theta' \\sin(T_{0} + \\theta) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n-2 D_{0}D_{1}x_{0} = -2 \\left[ -a' \\sin(T_{0} + \\theta) - a \\theta' \\cos(T_{0} + \\theta) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n-2 D_{0}D_{1}x_{0} = 2a' \\sin(T_{0} + \\theta) + 2a\\theta' \\cos(T_{0} + \\theta)\n$$\nFor the second term, $x_{0}^3$, we use the trigonometric identity $\\cos^3(\\phi) = \\frac{3}{4}\\cos(\\phi) + \\frac{1}{4}\\cos(3\\phi)$:\n$$\nx_{0}^3 = \\left[ a \\cos(T_{0} + \\theta) \\right]^3 = a^3 \\cos^3(T_{0} + \\theta)\n$$\n$$\nx_{0}^3 = a^3 \\left[ \\frac{3}{4}\\cos(T_{0} + \\theta) + \\frac{1}{4}\\cos(3(T_{0} + \\theta)) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nx_{0}^3 = \\frac{3a^3}{4} \\cos(T_{0} + \\theta) + \\frac{a^3}{4} \\cos(3T_{0} + 3\\theta)\n$$\nNow, substitute these expressions back into the RHS of the equation for $x_{1}$:\n$$\n\\text{RHS} = \\left[ 2a' \\sin(T_{0} + \\theta) + 2a\\theta' \\cos(T_{0} + \\theta) \\right] + \\left[ \\frac{3a^3}{4}\\cos(T_{0} + \\theta) + \\frac{a^3}{4}\\cos(3T_{0} + 3\\theta) \\right]\n$$\nGroup the terms that are resonant (proportional to $\\cos(T_{0}+\\theta)$ and $\\sin(T_{0}+\\theta)$) and non-resonant:\n$$\n\\text{RHS} = \\left( 2a\\theta' + \\frac{3a^3}{4} \\right) \\cos(T_{0} + \\theta) + (2a') \\sin(T_{0} + \\theta) + \\frac{a^3}{4}\\cos(3T_{0} + 3\\theta)\n$$\nTo eliminate secular growth in $x_{1}$, the coefficients of the resonant terms must vanish. This gives two conditions:\n1.  The coefficient of $\\sin(T_{0} + \\theta)$ must be zero:\n    $$\n    2a' = 0 \\implies \\frac{da}{dT_{1}} = 0\n    $$\n2.  The coefficient of $\\cos(T_{0} + \\theta)$ must be zero:\n    $$\n    2a\\theta' + \\frac{3a^3}{4} = 0 \\implies \\frac{d\\theta}{dT_{1}} = -\\frac{3a^2}{8}\n    $$\nThe first equation is the envelope equation for the amplitude $a(T_{1})$. It shows that for the undamped Duffing equation, the amplitude of the leading-order oscillation is constant on the slow time scale. The second equation shows that the nonlinearity induces a slow, amplitude-dependent shift in the phase, which corresponds to a correction of the oscillation frequency.\n\nThe problem asks for the symbolic expression for the slow-time derivative of the amplitude $a(T_{1})$, which is $\\frac{da}{dT_{1}}$. From our derivation, this expression is $0$.",
