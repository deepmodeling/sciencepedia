We will solve a simple linear relaxation model subject to a weak forcing term, a common scenario in many physical systems. The primary goal is to master the systematic procedure of postulating a power series solution and solving the hierarchy of equations that emerges at each order of the small parameter $\\epsilon$, illustrating a case where this straightforward approach is perfectly effective .",

Here $\\epsilon$ is a dimensionless small parameter quantifying the strength of the input relative to the intrinsic relaxation. Using the framework of regular perturbation theory and asymptotic analysis, construct a regular perturbation expansion for $y(t)$ in powers of $\\epsilon$ and determine $y(t)$ up to and including terms of order $\\epsilon^{2}$. Your derivation must begin from core definitions in perturbation theory (e.g., formal series expansion and order-by-order balance).

            "introduction": "We now advance to a class of problems where regular perturbation fails, necessitating more sophisticated techniques. This exercise presents a classic convection-diffusion model, a quintessential example of a singular perturbation problem where a boundary layer emerges. You will first demonstrate why the simplified \"outer\" model cannot satisfy all boundary conditions, and then apply the powerful method of matched asymptotic expansions to construct and combine the distinct \"inner\" and \"outer\" solutions into a uniformly valid approximation .",

            "problem": "Consider the boundary value problem for the scalar field $u(x)$ on the interval $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$,\n$$\n\\epsilon\\,u''(x) + u'(x) = 0,\\qquad u(0) = 0,\\quad u(1) = 1,\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon  0$ is a small nondimensional parameter measuring the ratio of diffusive to convective effects. This model arises in multiscale modeling when a slow diffusion process is dominated by transport, and the highest derivative is multiplied by the small parameter. Starting from the fundamental definition of a singular perturbation (the reduced problem obtained by setting $\\epsilon = 0$ changes the differential order and cannot generally accommodate both boundary conditions), do the following:\n\n1.

No numerical approximation is required.",
            "solution": "The solution proceeds by following the three parts of the problem statement.\n\n**1. Analysis of an Ill-Posed Reduced Problem and Boundary Layer Location**\nThe governing differential equation is $\\epsilon\\,u''(x) + u'(x) = 0$. In the singular limit $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the equation reduces to what is known as the reduced problem:\n$$u'(x) = 0$$\nThis is a first-order differential equation whose general solution is $u(x) = C$, where $C$ is an arbitrary constant. The original problem specifies two boundary conditions, $u(0) = 0$ and $u(1) = 1$. A first-order equation can typically satisfy only one such condition.\nIf we apply the boundary condition at $x=0$, we find $C=0$, so $u(x)=0$. This solution fails to satisfy the condition at $x=1$, since $u(1) \\neq 1$.\nIf we apply the boundary condition at $x=1$, we find $C=1$, so $u(x)=1$. This solution fails to satisfy the condition at $x=0$, since $u(0) \\neq 0$.\nBecause the reduced problem cannot satisfy both boundary conditions simultaneously, it is ill-posed as a representation of the full problem on the interval $[0,1]$. This discrepancy signals the presence of a boundary layer, a narrow region where the full term $\\epsilon u''$ is significant and the solution changes rapidly.\n\nTo locate this layer, we perform an order-of-magnitude balancing. Let $\\delta$ be the characteristic thickness of the boundary layer. Within this layer, derivatives scale as $d/dx \\sim 1/\\delta$. The terms in the ODE must be of the same magnitude:\n$$O(\\epsilon \\frac{u}{\\delta^2}) \\sim O(\\frac{u}{\\delta})$$\nThis implies $\\epsilon/\\delta \\sim 1$, so the layer thickness is of order $\\delta \\sim \\epsilon$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the layer becomes very thin. The solution outside this layer is called the outer solution and is governed by the reduced problem. The $u'(x)$ term represents convection, and its positive sign indicates that information is transported in the direction of increasing $x$. Thus, the downstream boundary condition at $x=1$ dictates the behavior of the outer solution. We therefore set the outer solution to satisfy $u(1)=1$, which means $u_{out}(x) = 1$. This solution does not satisfy the upstream condition $u(0)=0$. The mismatch occurs at $x=0$, so the boundary layer must be located at $x=0$.\n\n**2. Matched Asymptotic Expansions (MAE)**\nWe derive the leading-order outer and a leading-order inner solution.\n\n**Outer Solution**: The outer solution, valid for $x \\gg \\epsilon$, is sought as an asymptotic series $u_{out}(x) \\sim u_0(x) + \\epsilon u_1(x) + \\dots$. Substituting into the ODE and collecting terms of order $O(1)$ gives the reduced problem:\n$$u_0'(x) = 0 \\implies u_0(x) = C_0$$\nAs argued above, this outer solution must satisfy the boundary condition away from the layer, at $x=1$. So, $u_0(1) = 1$, which gives $C_0 = 1$. The leading-order outer solution is:\n$$u_{out,0}(x) = 1$$\n\n**Inner Solution**: In the boundary layer at $x=0$, we introduce a stretched coordinate $X = x/\\epsilon$. We denote the inner solution as $U(X) = u(\\epsilon X)$. The derivatives with respect to $x$ become derivatives with respect to $X$:\n$$u'(x) = \\frac{dU}{dX}\\frac{dX}{dx} = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\frac{dU}{dX}$$\n$$u''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\frac{dU}{dX}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2}\\frac{d^2U}{dX^2}$$\nSubstituting these into the original ODE yields:\n$$\\epsilon\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2}\\frac{d^2U}{dX^2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\frac{dU}{dX} = 0 \\implies \\frac{d^2U}{dX^2} + \\frac{dU}{dX} = 0$$\nThis is the inner equation. We expand the inner solution as $U(X) \\sim U_0(X) + \\epsilon U_1(X) + \\dots$. The leading-order inner equation is:\n$$U_0''(X) + U_0'(X) = 0$$\nThe general solution is $U_0(X) = A + B\\exp(-X)$. The inner solution must satisfy the boundary condition inside the layer, at $x=0$ (which is $X=0$): $u(0)=0 \\implies U_0(0)=0$.\n$$U_0(0) = A + B\\exp(0) = A+B = 0 \\implies B = -A$$\nSo, the leading-order inner solution has the form $U_{in,0}(X) = A(1 - \\exp(-X))$.\n\n**Asymptotic Matching**: The constant $A$ is found by matching the inner and outer solutions. According to the Van Dyke matching principle, the long-range behavior of the inner solution must match the short-range behavior of the outer solution:\n$$ \\lim_{X\\to\\infty} U_{in,0}(X) = \\lim_{x\\to 0} u_{out,0}(x) $$\n$$ \\lim_{X\\to\\infty} A(1 - \\exp(-X)) = \\lim_{x\\to 0} 1 $$\n$$ A(1 - 0) = 1 \\implies A = 1$$\nTherefore, the leading-order inner solution is $U_{in,0}(X) = 1 - \\exp(-X)$. In terms of the original variable $x$, it is $u_{in,0}(x) = 1 - \\exp(-x/\\epsilon)$.\n\n**3. Uniformly Valid Composite Approximation**\nA composite solution, $u_{comp}(x)$, that is uniformly valid for $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$ is constructed by adding the outer and inner solutions and subtracting their common overlapping part:\n$$u_{comp}(x) = u_{out,0}(x) + u_{in,0}(x) - (\\text{common part})$$\nThe common part is the value obtained from the matching condition, which is $\\lim_{x\\to 0} u_{out,0}(x) = 1$.\n$$u_{comp}(x) = 1 + \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\epsilon}\\right)\\right) - 1$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the final single closed-form analytic expression for the uniformly valid composite approximation:\n$$u_{comp}(x) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\epsilon}\\right)$$\nThis approximation satisfies $u_{comp}(0)=1 - \\exp(0) = 0$, and for $x0$, $u_{comp}(x) \\to 1$ as $\\epsilon \\to 0$, satisfying both boundary conditions in the correct asymptotic sense.",

The parameter $\\epsilon$ is small and positive, i.e., $0  \\epsilon \\ll 1$.\n\nThis is a singular perturbation problem because the highest-order derivative, $y''(x)$, is multiplied by the small parameter $\\epsilon$. When we set $\\epsilon=0$, the order of the equation is reduced, and in general, the resulting solution cannot satisfy both boundary conditions. This suggests the presence of a boundary layer, a narrow region where the solution changes rapidly.\n\nFirst, we determine the location of the boundary layer. The coefficient of the first derivative term is $a(x) = 1+x$. Since $a(x)  0$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$, the boundary layer is located at the left end of the interval, i.e., at $x=0$.\n\n**Outer Solution**\n\nAway from the boundary layer (in the \"outer\" region), the solution is expected to vary slowly. We seek an asymptotic expansion for the outer solution, $y_{out}(x;\\epsilon)$, of the form $y_{out}(x;\\epsilon) = y_0(x) + \\epsilon y_1(x) + \\dots$.\nSubstituting this into the ODE and collecting terms of order $\\epsilon^0$ (i.e., setting $\\epsilon=0$), we get the reduced equation:\n$$ (1+x)\\, y_0'(x) + y_0(x) = 0 $$\nThis equation can be rewritten as $\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( (1+x) y_0(x) \\right) = 0$.\nIntegrating with respect to $x$ yields $(1+x) y_0(x) = C$, where $C$ is a constant of integration.\nThus, the leading-order outer solution is:\n$$ y_0(x) = \\frac{C}{1+x} $$\nSince the boundary layer is at $x=0$, the outer solution must satisfy the boundary condition at the other end, $x=1$. Applying $y(1)=1$ to $y_0(x)$:\n$$ y_0(1) = \\frac{C}{1+1} = 1 \\implies C = 2 $$\nSo, the leading-order outer solution is:\n$$ y_{out,0}(x) = \\frac{2}{1+x} $$\n\n**Inner Solution**\n\nNear the boundary layer at $x=0$, the solution changes rapidly. We introduce a stretched, or inner, coordinate $\\xi$ to resolve this rapid change.

According to Van Dyke's matching principle, the outer limit of the inner solution must equal the inner limit of the outer solution.\n$$ \\lim_{\\xi \\to \\infty} Y_0(\\xi) = \\lim_{x \\to 0} y_{out,0}(x) $$\nThe left-hand side is:\n$$ \\lim_{\\xi \\to \\infty} A(1 - \\exp(-\\xi)) = A(1 - 0) = A $$\nThe right-hand side is:\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{2}{1+x} = 2 $$\nEquating the two limits gives $A=2$.\nTherefore, the leading-order inner solution is:\n$$ y_{in,0}(x) = Y_0(x/\\epsilon) = 2(1 - \\exp(-x/\\epsilon)) $$\n\n**Composite Solution**\n\nA uniformly valid composite expansion, $y_{\\text{comp}}(x;\\epsilon)$, can be constructed by adding the outer and inner solutions and subtracting their common part (the part that is duplicated in both). The common part is the value obtained in the matching procedure.\n$$ y_{\\text{comp}}(x;\\epsilon) \\approx y_{out,0}(x) + y_{in,0}(x) - (\\text{common part}) $$\nThe common part is the limit $\\lim_{x\\to 0} y_{out,0}(x) = \\lim_{\\xi\\to\\infty} Y_0(\\xi) = 2$.\nSo, the leading-order uniformly valid composite expansion is:\n$$ y_{\\text{comp}}(x;\\epsilon) = \\frac{2}{1+x} + 2(1 - \\exp(-x/\\epsilon)) - 2 $$\nSimplifying this expression gives the final result:\n$$ y_{\\text{comp}}(x;\\epsilon) = \\frac{2}{1+x} - 2\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\epsilon}\\right) $$\nLet us verify the boundary conditions for this composite solution.\nAt $x=0$:\n$ y_{\\text{comp}}(0;\\epsilon) = \\frac{2}{1+0} - 2\\exp(0) = 2 - 2 = 0 $.

As $\\epsilon \\to 0$, $\\exp(-1/\\epsilon) \\to 0$, so $y_{\\text{comp}}(1;\\epsilon) \\to 1$. The solution satisfies the boundary condition at $x=1$ asymptotically. The error term, $2\\exp(-1/\\epsilon)$, is transcendentally small.\nThe derived expression is the correct leading-order uniformly valid composite expansion.",
