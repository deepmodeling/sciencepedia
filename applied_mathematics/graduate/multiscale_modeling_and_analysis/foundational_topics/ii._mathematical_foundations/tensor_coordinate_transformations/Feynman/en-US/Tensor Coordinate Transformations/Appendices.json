            "solution": "The problem statement is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. We may proceed directly to the solution. The task is bifurcated: first, to derive the transformation law for a second-order tensor under a passive rotation, and second, to apply this law to compute a specific component of the provided stress tensor in a rotated frame.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Tensor Transformation Rule\n\nLet $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ be a second-order tensor, $\\mathbf{n}$ be a vector, and $\\mathbf{t}$ be the vector resulting from the linear mapping $\\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\mathbf{n}$. In a Cartesian frame $\\mathcal{S}$ with basis $\\{\\mathbf{e}_i\\}$, this relationship is expressed in terms of components as $t_i = \\sigma_{ij} n_j$, where the summation convention is implied over the repeated index $j$. In matrix notation, this is $[t]_{\\mathcal{S}} = [\\sigma]_{\\mathcal{S}} [n]_{\\mathcal{S}}$.\n\nConsider a second Cartesian frame $\\mathcal{S}'$, with basis $\\{\\mathbf{e}'_k\\}$, obtained by a passive rotation of $\\mathcal{S}$. The physical vectors $\\mathbf{t}$ and $\\mathbf{n}$, and the tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, are invariant entities. Their components, however, depend on the chosen basis. In the new frame, the relationship is $[t]_{\\mathcal{S}'} = [\\sigma]_{\\mathcal{S}'} [n]_{\\mathcal{S}'}$.\n\nThe transformation of vector components from frame $\\mathcal{S}$ to $\\mathcal{S}'$ under a passive rotation is given by a change-of-basis matrix $\\mathbf{Q}$, whose elements are $Q_{ij} = \\mathbf{e}'_i \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_j$. The components of any vector $\\mathbf{v}$ in the two frames are related by $[v]_{\\mathcal{S}'} = \\mathbf{Q} [v]_{\\mathcal{S}}$.\nThus, for vectors $\\mathbf{t}$ and $\\mathbf{n}$, we have:\n$$[t]_{\\mathcal{S}'} = \\mathbf{Q} [t]_{\\mathcal{S}}$$\n$$[n]_{\\mathcal{S}'} = \\mathbf{Q} [n]_{\\mathcal{S}}$$\nSince the basis transformation is orthonormal, the matrix $\\mathbf{Q}$ is orthogonal, meaning its inverse is its transpose: $\\mathbf{Q}^{-1} = \\mathbf{Q}^T$. We can express the components in the original frame in terms of the components in the new frame:\n$$[t]_{\\mathcal{S}} = \\mathbf{Q}^T [t]_{\\mathcal{S}'}$$\n$$[n]_{\\mathcal{S}} = \\mathbf{Q}^T [n]_{\\mathcal{S}'}$$\nNow, we substitute these into the defining relationship in the original frame $\\mathcal{S}$:\n$$[t]_{\\mathcal{S}} = [\\sigma]_{\\mathcal{S}} [n]_{\\mathcal{S}}$$\n$$\\mathbf{Q}^T [t]_{\\mathcal{S}'} = [\\sigma]_{\\mathcal{S}} (\\mathbf{Q}^T [n]_{\\mathcal{S}'})$$\nTo isolate $[t]_{\\mathcal{S}'}$, we pre-multiply both sides by $\\mathbf{Q}$:\n$$\\mathbf{Q} (\\mathbf{Q}^T [t]_{\\mathcal{S}'}) = \\mathbf{Q} [\\sigma]_{\\mathcal{S}} \\mathbf{Q}^T [n]_{\\mathcal{S}'}$$\n$$(\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{Q}^T) [t]_{\\mathcal{S}'} = (\\mathbf{Q} [\\sigma]_{\\mathcal{S}} \\mathbf{Q}^T) [n]_{\\mathcal{S}'}$$\nSince $\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{Q}^T = \\mathbf{I}$ (the identity matrix), we have:\n$$[t]_{\\mathcal{S}'} = (\\mathbf{Q} [\\sigma]_{\\mathcal{S}} \\mathbf{Q}^T) [n]_{\\mathcal{S}'}$$\nBy comparing this result with the definition in the new frame, $[t]_{\\mathcal{S}'} = [\\sigma]_{\\mathcal{S}'} [n]_{\\mathcal{S}'}$, we identify the transformation law for the components of the second-order tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$:\n$$[\\sigma]_{\\mathcal{S}'} = \\mathbf{Q} [\\sigma]_{\\mathcal{S}} \\mathbf{Q}^T$$\nThis is the required transformation rule in compact matrix form. In component (index) notation, this is written as:\n$$\\sigma'_{kl} = Q_{ki} \\sigma_{ij} (Q^T)_{jl} = Q_{ki} \\sigma_{ij} Q_{lj}$$\nwhere summation over $i$ and $j$ from $1$ to $3$ is implied. This completes the derivation.\n\nPart 2: Computation of the Shear Stress Component $\\sigma'_{12}$\n\nThe rotation is passive, about the $\\mathbf{e}_3$-axis by an angle $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$. The new basis vectors $\\{\\mathbf{e}'_1, \\mathbf{e}'_2, \\mathbf{e}'_3\\}$ are related to the old ones by:\n$$\\mathbf{e}'_1 = \\cos(\\theta) \\mathbf{e}_1 + \\sin(\\theta) \\mathbf{e}_2$$\n$$\\mathbf{e}'_2 = -\\sin(\\theta) \\mathbf{e}_1 + \\cos(\\theta) \\mathbf{e}_2$$\n$$\\mathbf{e}'_3 = \\mathbf{e}_3$$\nThe change-of-basis matrix $\\mathbf{Q}$ has components $Q_{ij} = \\mathbf{e}'_i \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_j$. With $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$, we have $\\cos(\\theta) = \\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nThe matrix $\\mathbf{Q}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{Q} = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos(\\theta) & \\sin(\\theta) & 0 \\\\\n-\\sin(\\theta) & \\cos(\\theta) & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe stress tensor components in frame $\\mathcal{S}$ are given as:\n$$\n[\\sigma]_{\\mathcal{S}} = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n10 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n2 & 4 & -3 \\\\\n1 & -3 & 5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe seek the component $\\sigma'_{12}$. Using the component-wise transformation rule:\n$$\\sigma'_{12} = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\sum_{j=1}^3 Q_{1i} \\sigma_{ij} Q_{2j}$$\nThe non-zero elements of the first row of $\\mathbf{Q}$ are $Q_{11} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and $Q_{12} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. The non-zero elements of the second row are $Q_{21} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and $Q_{22} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. The summations thus reduce to four terms for $i,j \\in \\{1,2\\}$:\n$$\\sigma'_{12} = Q_{11}\\sigma_{11}Q_{21} + Q_{11}\\sigma_{12}Q_{22} + Q_{12}\\sigma_{21}Q_{21} + Q_{12}\\sigma_{22}Q_{22}$$\nSubstituting the values of the components of $\\mathbf{Q}$ and $[\\sigma]_{\\mathcal{S}}$:\n$$\\sigma'_{12} = (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})(10)(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}) + (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})(2)(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}) + (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})(2)(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}) + (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})(4)(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})$$\nThe calculation simplifies as follows:\n$$\\sigma'_{12} = -\\frac{10}{2} + \\frac{2}{2} - \\frac{2}{2} + \\frac{4}{2}$$\n$$\\sigma'_{12} = -5 + 1 - 1 + 2$$\n$$\\sigma'_{12} = -3$$\nAlternatively, one can use the established formula for the transformation of plane stress components:\n$$\\sigma'_{12} = \\frac{\\sigma_{22}-\\sigma_{11}}{2}\\sin(2\\theta) + \\sigma_{12}\\cos(2\\theta)$$\nGiven $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$, we have $2\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Therefore, $\\sin(2\\theta) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 1$ and $\\cos(2\\theta) = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 0$. The values for the stress components are $\\sigma_{11} = 10$, $\\sigma_{22} = 4$, and $\\sigma_{12}=2$.\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$\\sigma'_{12} = \\frac{4-10}{2}(1) + (2)(0)$$\n$$\\sigma'_{12} = \\frac{-6}{2} = -3$$\nBoth methods yield the same result.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe stress in the rotated macroscale frame, $\\sigma'$, is given by the constitutive relation $\\sigma' = C' : \\varepsilon'$, where $C'$ is the stiffness tensor in the macroscale frame and $\\varepsilon'$ is the strain tensor in that same frame. In component form, this is written as:\n$$\n\\sigma'_{ij} = C'_{ijkl} \\varepsilon'_{kl}\n$$\nWe are asked to find the component $\\sigma'_{11}$. Expanding the sum for $i=j=1$:\n$$\n\\sigma'_{11} = \\sum_{k=1}^3 \\sum_{l=1}^3 C'_{11kl} \\varepsilon'_{kl}\n$$\nThe problem states that the only non-zero component of the macroscale strain tensor is $\\varepsilon'_{11} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}$. Therefore, the sum simplifies significantly to:\n$$\n\\sigma'_{11} = C'_{1111} \\varepsilon'_{11}\n$$\nThe core of the problem is to determine the component $C'_{1111}$ of the rotated stiffness tensor. The transformation rule for a fourth-order tensor from the unprimed (crystal) frame to the primed (macroscale) frame is given by:\n$$\nC'_{ijkl} = \\sum_{m,n,p,q=1}^3 R_{im} R_{jn} R_{kp} R_{lq} C_{mnpq}\n$$\nwhere $R_{ij}$ are the components of the passive rotation matrix (change-of-basis matrix). For a passive rotation of the coordinate system by an angle $\\theta$ about the $\\mathbf{e}_3$ axis, the matrix components are given by:\n$$\n[R] = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta & 0 \\\\ -\\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo find $C'_{1111}$, we set $i=j=k=l=1$ in the transformation formula:\n$$\nC'_{1111} = \\sum_{m,n,p,q=1}^3 R_{1m} R_{1n} R_{1p} R_{1q} C_{mnpq}\n$$\nThe components of the first row of $R$ are $R_{11} = \\cos\\theta$, $R_{12} = \\sin\\theta$, and $R_{13} = 0$. Since $R_{13}$ is zero, any term in the sum where any of the indices $m, n, p, q$ is equal to $3$ will be zero. Thus, the sum is restricted to indices $1$ and $2$:\n$$\nC'_{1111} = \\sum_{m,n,p,q=1}^2 R_{1m} R_{1n} R_{1p} R_{1q} C_{mnpq}\n$$\nThe material properties given ($C_{1111}$, $C_{2222}$, $C_{1122}$, $C_{1212}$) correspond to a material with at least orthotropic symmetry. For such materials, any stiffness component $C_{mnpq}$ with an index appearing an odd number of times is zero (e.g., $C_{1112}=0$, $C_{1222}=0$). Therefore, we only need to consider terms where each index ($1$ or $2$) appears an even number of times (zero, two, or four times).\nLet $c = \\cos\\theta$ and $s = \\sin\\theta$. So, $R_{11} = c$ and $R_{12} = s$.\n\n1.  All indices are $1$: $(m, n, p, q) = (1, 1, 1, 1)$. The term is $(R_{11})^4 C_{1111} = c^4 C_{1111}$.\n2.  All indices are $2$: $(m, n, p, q) = (2, 2, 2, 2)$. The term is $(R_{12})^4 C_{2222} = s^4 C_{2222}$.\n3.  Two indices are $1$ and two are $2$: The coefficient is $(R_{11})^2(R_{12})^2 = c^2s^2$. We must sum over all permutations of the indices $(1,1,2,2)$. The terms are:\n    $C_{1122}$, $C_{1212}$, $C_{1221}$, $C_{2112}$, $C_{2121}$, $C_{2211}$.\n    Using the given minor and major symmetries ($C_{ijkl}=C_{ijlk}$, $C_{ijkl}=C_{jikl}$, $C_{ijkl}=C_{klij}$):\n    $C_{1221} = C_{1212}$, $C_{2112} = C_{1212}$, $C_{2121} = C_{1212}$, and $C_{2211} = C_{1122}$.\n    The sum of these components is $C_{1122} + C_{1212} + C_{1212} + C_{1212} + C_{1212} + C_{1122} = 2C_{1122} + 4C_{1212}$.\n    The total contribution from these terms is $c^2s^2(2C_{1122} + 4C_{1212})$.\n\nCombining these contributions, we obtain the expression for $C'_{1111}$:\n$$\nC'_{1111} = c^4 C_{1111} + s^4 C_{2222} + 2c^2s^2(C_{1122} + 2C_{1212})\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values. The angle is $\\theta = \\pi/6$.\n$c = \\cos(\\pi/6) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n$s = \\sin(\\pi/6) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$c^2 = \\frac{3}{4}$, $s^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$, $c^4 = \\frac{9}{16}$, $s^4 = \\frac{1}{16}$, $c^2s^2 = \\frac{3}{16}$.\nThe stiffness components are (in GPa):\n$C_{1111} = 190$, $C_{2222} = 60$, $C_{1122} = 15$, $C_{1212} = 40$.\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for $C'_{1111}$:\n$$\nC'_{1111} = \\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right)(190) + \\left(\\frac{1}{16}\\right)(60) + 2\\left(\\frac{3}{16}\\right)(15 + 2(40))\n$$\n$$\nC'_{1111} = \\frac{1}{16} [9(190) + 1(60) + 6(15 + 80)]\n$$\n$$\nC'_{1111} = \\frac{1}{16} [1710 + 60 + 6(95)]\n$$\n$$\nC'_{1111} = \\frac{1}{16} [1770 + 570]\n$$\n$$\nC'_{1111} = \\frac{2340}{16} = 146.25~\\text{GPa}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the stress component $\\sigma'_{11}$:\n$$\n\\sigma'_{11} = C'_{1111} \\varepsilon'_{11} = (146.25~\\text{GPa}) \\times (1.5 \\times 10^{-3})\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma'_{11} = 0.219375~\\text{GPa}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\sigma'_{11} \\approx 0.2194~\\text{GPa}\n$$",

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the distinction between two types of transformations:\n1.  **Passive Transformation (Covariance):** This refers to changing the coordinate system used by the observer to describe a physical reality that remains fixed. If a tensor is described by its components $T$ in one orthonormal basis, and an observer switches to a new orthonormal basis related to the first by a rotation matrix $Q \\in SO(n)$, the components of the *same* tensor in the new basis will be $T' = Q \\cdot T$. For a rank-$2$ tensor, this is $T' = Q T Q^\\top$. This is a definitional property of a tensor, often called covariance or tensoriality, and it holds for any tensor, regardless of the material's properties.\n2.  **Active Transformation (Symmetry):** This refers to physically transforming the object or system itself (e.g., rotating the material specimen), while the observer's coordinate system remains fixed. Isotropy is a material symmetry. It means the material's internal structure is indifferent to its orientation. The problem defines this as \"physical rotations of the specimen do not change the constitutive response except by rigid rotation of the response itself.\"\n\nLet's formalize the condition for isotropy. Let the constitutive law be $\\Phi$.\n- Consider an input tensor $A$. The material response is $\\Phi(A)$.\n- Now, physically rotate the material specimen by a rotation $Q \\in SO(n)$. The input tensor, as seen by the rotated material, is also rotated to $Q \\cdot A$.\n- Since the material is isotropic, its response to this rotated input $Q \\cdot A$ is given by the same constitutive function, $\\Phi$. So the output is $\\Phi(Q \\cdot A)$.\n- The physical principle of isotropy states that this new response must be nothing more than the original response, $\\Phi(A)$, subjected to the same physical rotation $Q$. That is, the response should be $Q \\cdot \\Phi(A)$.\n- Equating these two gives the mathematical condition for isotropy:\n$$ \\Phi(Q \\cdot A) = Q \\cdot \\Phi(A) \\quad \\forall A \\in \\mathcal{X}, \\forall Q \\in SO(n) $$\nThis property is known as **$SO(n)$-equivariance**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option.\n\n**A. For a rank-$2$ tensor field $T$, a passive change of coordinates by $Q \\in SO(n)$ yields component transformation $T' = Q T Q^{\\top}$. This is a requirement of tensoriality (coordinate covariance) and is not, by itself, a constitutive symmetry; it holds regardless of whether the material is isotropic.**\nThis statement accurately describes a passive transformation. The formula $T' = Q T Q^\\top$ is the rule for how the components of a rank-$2$ tensor change under a rotation of the coordinate system. This is a fundamental aspect of how tensors are defined and is completely independent of any material properties or symmetries like isotropy. It correctly distinguishes this from a constitutive symmetry.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. If $\\Phi : \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathcal{Y}$ maps a rank-$2$ input tensor to a rank-$2$ output tensor, isotropy of the material is expressed by $SO(n)$-equivariance of $\\Phi$: for all $Q \\in SO(n)$ and all $A \\in \\mathcal{X}$, $\\Phi(Q \\cdot A) = Q \\cdot \\Phi(A)$.**\nAs derived above from the physical definition of isotropy, this is the precise mathematical formalization of the concept. It states that the constitutive map $\\Phi$ commutes with the action of the rotation group $SO(n)$. Rotating the input and then applying the map yields the same result as applying the map and then rotating the output.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Isotropy of $\\Phi : \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathcal{Y}$ requires $\\Phi(Q \\cdot A) = \\Phi(A)$ for all $Q \\in SO(n)$ and all $A \\in \\mathcal{X}$, i.e., the output is unchanged by any rotation of the input.**\nThis condition, $\\Phi(Q \\cdot A) = \\Phi(A)$, describes $SO(n)$-invariance of the function's output with respect to rotations of its input. This is a much stronger condition than isotropy and is generally incorrect. For example, in an isotropic elastic material, if you apply a rotated strain tensor, you expect to get a correspondingly rotated stress tensor, not the original, un-rotated stress tensor. The condition $\\Phi(Q \\cdot A) = \\Phi(A)$ implies that the output $\\Phi(A)$ is an isotropic tensor (i.e., a tensor $Y$ such that $Q \\cdot Y = Y$ for all $Q$) if the input space $\\mathcal{X}$ is transitively acted upon by $SO(n)$. This is not the general definition of an isotropic constitutive law.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. For a linear rank-$4$ elasticity tensor $C : \\mathrm{Sym} \\to \\mathrm{Sym}$ (mapping the space of symmetric rank-$2$ tensors $\\mathrm{Sym}$ to itself), isotropy is equivalent to $C$ being invariant under the $SO(n)$ action $(Q \\triangleright C)_{ijkl} := Q_{ip} Q_{jq} Q_{kr} Q_{ls} C_{pqrs}$, i.e., $C = Q \\triangleright C$ for all $Q \\in SO(n)$. Equivalently, in index form one has $C_{ijkl} = \\lambda \\,\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{kl} + \\mu \\,(\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl} + \\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk})$ with $\\lambda, \\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}$.**\nThis option applies the general principle to the specific case of linear elasticity, where the constitutive map is $\\Phi(\\epsilon) = C : \\epsilon$. The equivariance condition $\\Phi(Q \\cdot \\epsilon) = Q \\cdot \\Phi(\\epsilon)$ becomes $C : (Q \\epsilon Q^\\top) = Q (C:\\epsilon) Q^\\top$. It can be shown that this is equivalent to the condition that the components of the tensor $C$ are unchanged by a rotation of the coordinate system. The transformation rule for the components of a rank-$4$ tensor is $C'_{ijkl} = Q_{ip} Q_{jq} Q_{kr} Q_{ls} C_{pqrs}$. For an isotropic material, the components must be the same in any orthonormal basis, so $C' = C$. This is precisely the invariance condition $(Q \\triangleright C) = C$ stated in the option. Furthermore, it is a classic result of representation theory that a rank-$4$ tensor with the symmetries of the elasticity tensor ($C_{ijkl}=C_{jikl}=C_{ijlk}$ and $C_{ijkl}=C_{klij}$) that is also isotropic (invariant under $O(n)$, and therefore $SO(n)$) must have the specific component form $C_{ijkl} = \\lambda \\,\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{kl} + \\mu \\,(\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl} + \\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk})$, where $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ are the Lamé parameters. Both parts of the statement are correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Isotropy with respect to $SO(n)$ is equivalent to invariance under all invertible linear coordinate changes, i.e., under $GL(n)$; thus, if a constitutive law is isotropic it must be equivariant with respect to $GL(n)$, not only $SO(n)$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The Special Orthogonal group $SO(n)$ is the group of proper rotations (distance-preserving, orientation-preserving linear maps). The General Linear group $GL(n)$ is the group of all invertible linear transformations, which includes non-rigid transformations like shears, dilations, and reflections. Isotropy is specifically symmetry with respect to physical rotations. Demanding symmetry under all of $GL(n)$ is a vastly stronger and physically different condition. A material can be rotationally symmetric ($SO(n)$) without being symmetric under arbitrary shears or scaling. Therefore, $SO(n)$ equivariance is not equivalent to $GL(n)$ equivariance, and the former does not imply the latter.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nFinal summary: Options A, B, and D are correct statements.",
