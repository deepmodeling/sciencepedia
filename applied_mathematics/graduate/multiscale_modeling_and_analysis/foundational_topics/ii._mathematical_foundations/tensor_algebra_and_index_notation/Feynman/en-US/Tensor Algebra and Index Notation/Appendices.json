This practice moves beyond simple Cartesian systems to the more general setting of curvilinear coordinates, which is essential for modeling physical systems with complex geometries. By working through the mechanics of raising an index on a given tensor field in polar coordinates, you will solidify your understanding of how the metric tensor, $g_{ij}$, and its inverse, $g^{ij}$, encode the geometry of the space and govern tensor transformations.

            "problem": "Consider the Euclidean plane expressed in planar polar coordinates $(r,\\theta)$, with line element $ds^{2} = dr^{2} + r^{2} d\\theta^{2}$. In the coordinate basis $\\{\\partial_{r},\\partial_{\\theta}\\}$, the metric tensor $g_{ij}$ and its inverse $g^{ij}$ are to be explicitly written. A second-order covariant tensor field $F_{ij}(r,\\theta)$ arises in a multiscale homogenization of an anisotropic diffusion process, modeled at the mesoscale by the covariant components\n$$\nF_{rr}(r,\\theta) = \\alpha r^{2} + \\beta r \\cos\\big(2\\theta\\big),\\quad F_{r\\theta}(r,\\theta) = F_{\\theta r}(r,\\theta) = \\gamma r^{2} \\sin(\\theta),\\quad F_{\\theta\\theta}(r,\\theta) = \\delta r^{4} + \\epsilon r^{3} \\cos(\\theta),\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, $\\delta$, and $\\epsilon$ are strictly positive constants determined from the microscale effective properties and $r>0$.

Express your final answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $r$, $\\theta$, $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, $\\delta$, and $\\epsilon$.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It is a standard exercise in tensor calculus within the framework of Riemannian geometry.\n\nThe first step is to determine the components of the metric tensor $g_{ij}$ from the given line element in planar polar coordinates $(r,\\theta)$. The line element is defined as $ds^{2} = g_{ij} dx^{i} dx^{j}$, where the summation convention is implied. The coordinates are $x^{1}=r$ and $x^{2}=\\theta$. The given line element is:\n$$\nds^{2} = dr^{2} + r^{2} d\\theta^{2}\n$$\nComparing this to the general form $ds^{2} = g_{rr} (dr)^{2} + g_{r\\theta} dr d\\theta + g_{\\theta r} d\\theta dr + g_{\\theta\\theta} (d\\theta)^{2}$, we can identify the components of the covariant metric tensor $g_{ij}$. Since $dr d\\theta = d\\theta dr$, we have $g_{ij}=g_{ji}$, and the term is $2g_{r\\theta}dr d\\theta$.\nFrom the given expression, we identify:\n$g_{rr} = 1$\n$g_{\\theta\\theta} = r^{2}$\n$g_{r\\theta} = g_{\\theta r} = 0$\nIn matrix form, with the basis ordered as $(r, \\theta)$, the metric tensor $g_{ij}$ is:\n$$\ng_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} g_{rr} & g_{r\\theta} \\\\ g_{\\theta r} & g_{\\theta\\theta} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & r^{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe next step is to find the contravariant inverse metric tensor $g^{ij}$. This tensor is defined by the relation $g^{ik}g_{kj} = \\delta^{i}_{j}$, where $\\delta^{i}_{j}$ is the Kronecker delta. In matrix terms, $g^{ij}$ is the inverse of the matrix for $g_{ij}$. For a diagonal matrix, the inverse is found by taking the reciprocal of each diagonal element.\n$$\ng^{ij} = (g_{ij})^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & r^{2} \\end{pmatrix}^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1^{-1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & (r^{2})^{-1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & r^{-2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThus, the components of the inverse metric are:\n$g^{rr} = 1$\n$g^{\\theta\\theta} = r^{-2}$\n$g^{r\\theta} = g^{\\theta r} = 0$\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the mixed tensor $F^{i}{}_{j}$ by raising the first index of the covariant tensor $F_{ij}$.

In multiscale modeling of continua, it is often necessary to decompose a microscopic second-order field into macroscopic symmetric (strain) and antisymmetric (spin) components using linear projection operators.

            "solution": "The problem requires us to construct the linear projection operators for the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of a second-order tensor and then to compute a specific contraction of the symmetric projection operator. The entire derivation will be performed in an $n$-dimensional Euclidean space using index notation and the Einstein summation convention.\n\nFirst, we will construct the symmetric projection operator, denoted by $P^{(ij)}{}_{kl}$. The defining property of this operator is that for any arbitrary second-order tensor $A^{kl}$, its action yields the symmetric part of the tensor, $A^{(ij)}$. The symmetric part is defined as $A^{(ij)} = \\frac{1}{2}(A^{ij} + A^{ji})$. The action of the operator is given by $(P^{(s)} \\cdot A)^{ij} = P^{(ij)}{}_{kl} A^{kl}$.\n\nTherefore, we must have:\n$$P^{(ij)}{}_{kl} A^{kl} = \\frac{1}{2}(A^{ij} + A^{ji})$$\nThis equation must hold for any tensor $A^{kl}$. To find the components of $P^{(ij)}{}_{kl}$, we express the terms on the right-hand side, $A^{ij}$ and $A^{ji}$, in a form that explicitly involves the dummy indices $k$ and $l$ and the tensor $A^{kl}$. This is achieved using the Kronecker delta, $\\delta^{p}{}_{q}$, which acts as an identity operator in index substitution.\n\nThe term $A^{ij}$ can be written as:\n$$A^{ij} = \\delta^{i}{}_{k} \\delta^{j}{}_{l} A^{kl}$$\nThe term $A^{ji}$ involves a permutation of the indices of $A^{kl}$. We can write it as:\n$$A^{ji} = \\delta^{j}{}_{k} \\delta^{i}{}_{l} A^{kl}$$\nNote that in the expression $\\delta^{j}{}_{k} \\delta^{i}{}_{l} A^{kl}$, the sum over $k$ replaces $k$ with $j$, and the sum over $l$ replaces $l$ with $i$, resulting in $A^{ji}$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the defining equation for the symmetric projector:\n$$P^{(ij)}{}_{kl} A^{kl} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\delta^{i}{}_{k} \\delta^{j}{}_{l} A^{kl} + \\delta^{j}{}_{k} \\delta^{i}{}_{l} A^{kl})$$\nWe can factor out the arbitrary tensor $A^{kl}$ from the right-hand side:\n$$P^{(ij)}{}_{kl} A^{kl} = \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\delta^{i}{}_{k} \\delta^{j}{}_{l} + \\delta^{i}{}_{l} \\delta^{j}{}_{k}) \\right] A^{kl}$$\nSince this identity must hold for any tensor $A^{kl}$, the coefficients of $A^{kl}$ on both sides must be equal. This gives us the explicit expression for the symmetric projection operator:\n$$P^{(ij)}{}_{kl} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\delta^{i}{}_{k} \\delta^{j}{}_{l} + \\delta^{i}{}_{l} \\delta^{j}{}_{k})$$\n\nSimilarly, we construct the antisymmetric projection operator, $P^{[ij]}{}_{kl}$. Its defining property is $(P^{(a)} \\cdot A)^{ij} = P^{[ij]}{}_{kl} A^{kl} = A^{[ij]}$, where $A^{[ij]} = \\frac{1}{2}(A^{ij} - A^{ji})$.\nFollowing the same procedure:\n$$P^{[ij]}{}_{kl} A^{kl} = \\frac{1}{2}(A^{ij} - A^{ji})$$\n$$P^{[ij]}{}_{kl} A^{kl} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\delta^{i}{}_{k} \\delta^{j}{}_{l} A^{kl} - \\delta^{j}{}_{k} \\delta^{i}{}_{l} A^{kl})$$\n$$P^{[ij]}{}_{kl} A^{kl} = \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\delta^{i}{}_{k} \\delta^{j}{}_{l} - \\delta^{i}{}_{l} \\delta^{j}{}_{k}) \\right] A^{kl}$$\nEquating the coefficients of $A^{kl}$ yields the expression for the antisymmetric projection operator:\n$$P^{[ij]}{}_{kl} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\delta^{i}{}_{k} \\delta^{j}{}_{l} - \\delta^{i}{}_{l} \\delta^{j}{}_{k})$$\n\nAs a check, we can verify the decomposition of the identity property stated in the problem: $P^{(ij)}{}_{kl} + P^{[ij]}{}_{kl} = \\delta^{i}{}_{k} \\delta^{j}{}_{l}$.\n$$P^{(ij)}{}_{kl} + P^{[ij]}{}_{kl} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\delta^{i}{}_{k} \\delta^{j}{}_{l} + \\delta^{i}{}_{l} \\delta^{j}{}_{k}) + \\frac{1}{2}(\\delta^{i}{}_{k} \\delta^{j}{}_{l} - \\delta^{i}{}_{l} \\delta^{j}{}_{k})$$\n$$= \\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\delta^{i}{}_{k} \\delta^{j}{}_{l} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\delta^{i}{}_{l} \\delta^{j}{}_{k}$$\n$$= \\delta^{i}{}_{k} \\delta^{j}{}_{l}$$\nThis matches the fourth-order identity tensor, confirming the correctness of our derived projectors.\n\nThe final part of the problem is to compute the scalar $S = P^{(ij)}{}_{ij}$. This requires a double contraction of the symmetric projection tensor, setting $k=i$ and $l=j$.\nStarting with the expression for $P^{(ij)}{}_{kl}$:\n$$S = P^{(ij)}{}_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\delta^{i}{}_{i} \\delta^{j}{}_{j} + \\delta^{i}{}_{j} \\delta^{j}{}_{i})$$\nWe must evaluate the two contraction terms, $\\delta^{i}{}_{i}$ and $\\delta^{i}{}_{j} \\delta^{j}{}_{i}$, in an $n$-dimensional space.\n\nThe term $\\delta^{i}{}_{i}$ represents the trace of the identity matrix of size $n \\times n$. The summation is over the index $i$ from $1$ to $n$:\n$$\\delta^{i}{}_{i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\delta_{ii} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1 = n$$\nTherefore, the first part of the expression is $\\delta^{i}{}_{i} \\delta^{j}{}_{j} = n \\cdot n = n^2$.\n\nThe term $\\delta^{i}{}_{j} \\delta^{j}{}_{i}$ involves a summation over both $i$ and $j$. We can perform the summation over one index first. Let's sum over $j$: $\\sum_{j} \\delta^{i}{}_{j}\\delta^{j}{}_{k} = \\delta^{i}{}_{k}$. Our expression is $\\delta^{i}{}_{j}\\delta^{j}{}_{i}$, which is the same as setting $k=i$ in the previous identity, resulting in $\\delta^{i}{}_{i}$. The full expression implies summation over both $i$ and $j$.\nLet's contract over $j$ first: $\\delta^{i}{}_{j} \\delta^{j}{}_{k} = \\delta^{i}{}_{k}$. Our term is $\\delta^{i}{}_{j} \\delta^{j}{}_{i}$, so we set $k=i$ to get $\\delta^{i}{}_{i}$. We are then left with a summation over $i$, so the result is $n$.\nThus, $\\delta^{i}{}_{j} \\delta^{j}{}_{i} = n$.\n\nNow, we substitute these results back into the expression for $S$:\n$$S = \\frac{1}{2}(\\delta^{i}{}_{i} \\delta^{j}{}_{j} + \\delta^{i}{}_{j} \\delta^{j}{}_{i}) = \\frac{1}{2}(n^2 + n)$$\nThis can be written in a factored form as:\n$$S = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$\nThis result is the trace of the symmetric projection operator. The trace of a projection operator is equal to the dimension of the subspace onto which it projects. The dimension of the space of symmetric second-order tensors in $n$ dimensions is indeed $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, which confirms our calculation.",
