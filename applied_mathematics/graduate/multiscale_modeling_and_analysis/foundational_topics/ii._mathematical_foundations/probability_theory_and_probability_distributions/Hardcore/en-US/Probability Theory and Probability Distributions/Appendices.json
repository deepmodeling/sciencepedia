It tells us that the sum of many independent and identically distributed random variables, when properly normalized, approaches a normal distribution. In multiscale modeling, where macroscopic observables often arise from averaging countless microscopic contributions, the CLT provides the foundational link between scales. However, for any finite system, a crucial practical question arises: how accurate is this normal approximation? This exercise provides hands-on practice with the Berry-Esseen theorem, a powerful tool for obtaining explicit, quantitative error bounds on the CLT approximation, bridging the gap between asymptotic theory and finite-scale reality .",

Determine the values of the parameters $a$ and $b$.\n2.  Calculate the third absolute moment $\\rho = \\mathbb{E}[|X_{i}|^{3}]$.\n3.  Apply the Berry-Esseen bound using the given constants.\n\nFirst, we determine $a$ and $b$ using the constraints on the mean and variance. The probability distribution of $X_i$ is given by $\\mathbb{P}(X_i = a) = p = \\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\mathbb{P}(X_i = -b) = 1-p = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nThe mean of $X_i$ is required to be zero:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X_{i}] = a \\cdot p + (-b) \\cdot (1-p) = 0 $$\nSubstituting $p=\\frac{1}{3}$:\n$$ a \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} - b \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = 0 $$\n$$ a - 2b = 0 \\implies a = 2b $$\nThis establishes a relationship between $a$ and $b$.\n\nThe variance of $X_i$ is required to be one. Since the mean is zero, the variance is equal to the second moment:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(X_{i}) = \\mathbb{E}[X_{i}^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[X_{i}])^2 = \\mathbb{E}[X_{i}^2] - 0^2 = \\mathbb{E}[X_{i}^2] $$\nThe second moment is calculated as:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X_{i}^2] = a^2 \\cdot p + (-b)^2 \\cdot (1-p) = 1 $$\nSubstituting $p=\\frac{1}{3}$:\n$$ a^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} + b^2 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = 1 $$\nNow, we substitute $a = 2b$ into this equation:\n$$ (2b)^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} + b^2 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = 1 $$\n$$ 4b^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2b^2}{3} = 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{4b^2 + 2b^2}{3} = 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{6b^2}{3} = 1 \\implies 2b^2 = 1 $$\n$$ b^2 = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nSince we are given $b0$, we have $b = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\nUsing $a=2b$, we find $a$:\n$$ a = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\sqrt{2} $$\nSo, the random variable $X_i$ takes the value $\\sqrt{2}$ with probability $\\frac{1}{3}$ and $-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ with probability $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nNext, we compute the third absolute moment, $\\rho = \\mathbb{E}[|X_{i}|^{3}]$. The possible values of $|X_i|$ are $|a| = \\sqrt{2}$ and $|-b| = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n$$ \\rho = \\mathbb{E}[|X_{i}|^{3}] = |a|^3 \\cdot p + |-b|^3 \\cdot (1-p) = a^3 p + b^3 (1-p) $$\nWe have $a^3 = (\\sqrt{2})^3 = 2\\sqrt{2}$ and $b^3 = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{8} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}$.\nSubstituting these values along with $p=\\frac{1}{3}$:\n$$ \\rho = (2\\sqrt{2}) \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} $$\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3} + \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{12} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{6} $$\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{6} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{6} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{6} $$\n\nFinally, we apply the Berry-Esseen theorem. For i.i.d. random variables $X_i$ with $\\mathbb{E}[X_i] = 0$, $\\operatorname{Var}(X_i) = \\sigma^2 = 1$, and $\\mathbb{E}[|X_i|^3] = \\rho$, the theorem provides the bound:\n$$ \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}}|\\mathbb{P}(S_{n}\\leq x)-\\Phi(x)| \\leq \\frac{C \\cdot \\rho}{\\sigma^3 \\sqrt{n}} $$\nwhere $S_n = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$. Given $\\sigma^2=1$, we have $\\sigma^3=1$. The bound simplifies to:\n$$ \\text{Bound} = \\frac{C \\cdot \\rho}{\\sqrt{n}} $$\nWe are given the constant $C=0.4748$ and $n=256$. We have $\\sqrt{n} = \\sqrt{256} = 16$.\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\text{Bound} = \\frac{0.4748 \\cdot \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{6}}{16} = \\frac{0.4748 \\cdot 5\\sqrt{2}}{6 \\cdot 16} = \\frac{2.374\\sqrt{2}}{96} $$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$$ \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41421356... $$\n$$ \\text{Bound} \\approx \\frac{2.374 \\cdot 1.41421356}{96} \\approx \\frac{3.357389}{96} \\approx 0.0349728... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the tightest exponential upper bound for the probability $\\mathbb{P}(S \\geq a)$, where $S$ is the sum of $N$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli random variables, $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_{i}$, with $X_i \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p)$. The derivation must start from first principles, namely Markov's inequality and the definition of the moment generating function (MGF).\n\nFirst, we state Markov's inequality. For any non-negative random variable $Y$ and any constant $c  0$, the inequality is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(Y \\geq c) \\leq \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[Y]}{c}\n$$\nThe event of interest is $\\{S \\geq a\\}$.

We can apply Markov's inequality to $Y$ with the constant $c = \\exp(\\lambda a)$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\exp(\\lambda S) \\geq \\exp(\\lambda a)) \\leq \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\lambda S)]}{\\exp(\\lambda a)}\n$$\nRewriting this inequality gives us an upper bound for $\\mathbb{P}(S \\geq a)$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(S \\geq a) \\leq \\exp(-\\lambda a) \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\lambda S)]\n$$\nThis inequality holds for any choice of $\\lambda  0$. To obtain the tightest possible bound of this form, we must minimize the right-hand side with respect to $\\lambda$. This leads to the Chernoff bound:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(S \\geq a) \\leq \\inf_{\\lambda  0} \\left( \\exp(-\\lambda a) \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\lambda S)] \\right)\n$$\nThe term $\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\lambda S)]$ is the moment generating function (MGF) of the random variable $S$, denoted as $M_S(\\lambda)$. Since $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_{i}$ and the $X_i$ are i.i.d., the MGF of the sum is the product of the individual MGFs:\n$$\nM_S(\\lambda) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\lambda \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right)\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\prod_{i=1}^{N} \\exp(\\lambda X_i)\\right] = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\lambda X_i)] = \\left(M_X(\\lambda)\\right)^N\n$$\nwhere $M_X(\\lambda)$ is the MGF of a single Bernoulli random variable $X \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p)$. We compute $M_X(\\lambda)$ from its definition:\n$$\nM_X(\\lambda) = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\lambda X)] = \\mathbb{P}(X=0)\\exp(\\lambda \\cdot 0) + \\mathbb{P}(X=1)\\exp(\\lambda \\cdot 1) = (1-p) \\cdot 1 + p \\cdot \\exp(\\lambda) = 1 - p + p\\exp(\\lambda)\n$$\nTherefore, the MGF of $S$ is:\n$$\nM_S(\\lambda) = (1 - p + p\\exp(\\lambda))^N\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the bound expression, we need to find:\n$$\n\\inf_{\\lambda  0} \\exp(-\\lambda a) (1 - p + p\\exp(\\lambda))^N\n$$\nTo find the infimum, we minimize the function $g(\\lambda) = \\exp(-\\lambda a) (1 - p + p\\exp(\\lambda))^N$. It is easier to minimize its natural logarithm, $h(\\lambda) = \\ln(g(\\lambda))$:\n$$\nh(\\lambda) = -\\lambda a + N \\ln(1 - p + p\\exp(\\lambda))\n$$\nWe find the critical point by setting the first derivative with respect to $\\lambda$ to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dh}{d\\lambda} = -a + N \\frac{p\\exp(\\lambda)}{1 - p + p\\exp(\\lambda)} = 0\n$$\nSolving for $\\exp(\\lambda)$:\n$$\na = N \\frac{p\\exp(\\lambda)}{1 - p + p\\exp(\\lambda)} \\implies a(1 - p + p\\exp(\\lambda)) = Np\\exp(\\lambda)\n$$\n$$\na(1-p) = \\exp(\\lambda)(Np - ap) = p\\exp(\\lambda)(N-a)\n$$\nThis gives the optimal value for $\\exp(\\lambda)$:\n$$\n\\exp(\\lambda^*) = \\frac{a(1-p)}{p(N-a)}\n$$\nThe optimal parameter is thus $\\lambda^* = \\ln\\left(\\frac{a(1-p)}{p(N-a)}\\right)$. For $\\lambda^*$ to be positive, we require its argument to be greater than $1$, which implies $a(1-p)  p(N-a) \\iff a  Np$. This means the exceedance threshold $a$ must be greater than the mean of $S$, which is the regime where large deviation bounds are meaningful. The second derivative of $h(\\lambda)$ is $h''(\\lambda) = N \\frac{p(1-p)\\exp(\\lambda)}{(1-p+p\\exp(\\lambda))^2}  0$ for $p \\in (0,1)$, confirming that $\\lambda^*$ corresponds to a minimum.\n\nNow, we substitute $\\exp(\\lambda^*)$ back into the bound expression $g(\\lambda)$. The bound is $g(\\lambda^*) = (\\exp(\\lambda^*))^{-a} (1 - p + p\\exp(\\lambda^*))^N$.\nThe first term is:\n$$\n(\\exp(\\lambda^*))^{-a} = \\left(\\frac{a(1-p)}{p(N-a)}\\right)^{-a} = \\left(\\frac{p(N-a)}{a(1-p)}\\right)^a\n$$\nThe second term is:\n$$\n(1 - p + p\\exp(\\lambda^*))^N = \\left(1 - p + p\\frac{a(1-p)}{p(N-a)}\\right)^N = \\left(1 - p + \\frac{a(1-p)}{N-a}\\right)^N = \\left(\\frac{(1-p)(N-a) + a(1-p)}{N-a}\\right)^N = \\left(\\frac{N(1-p)}{N-a}\\right)^N\n$$\nCombining these terms, the optimized bound is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(S \\geq a) \\leq \\left(\\frac{p(N-a)}{a(1-p)}\\right)^a \\left(\\frac{N(1-p)}{N-a}\\right)^N = \\frac{p^a (N-a)^a}{a^a (1-p)^a} \\frac{N^N (1-p)^N}{(N-a)^N} = \\left(\\frac{Np}{a}\\right)^a \\left(\\frac{N(1-p)}{N-a}\\right)^{N-a}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the optimized Chernoff bound. This expression is equivalent to $\\exp(-N D_{KL}(a/N \\| p))$, where $D_{KL}(q \\| p)$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two Bernoulli distributions with parameters $q=a/N$ and $p$.\n\nNow, we evaluate this bound for the given numerical values:\n- $N = 5000$\n- $p = 0.003$\n- $a = 30$\n\nFirst, we calculate the necessary components for the closed-form expression:\n- Mean number of failures: $\\mathbb{E}[S] = Np = 5000 \\times 0.003 = 15$. The condition $a  Np$ is satisfied ($30  15$).\n- $N-a = 5000 - 30 = 4970$.\n- $1-p = 1 - 0.003 = 0.997$.\n\nThe bound is given by:\n$$\nB = \\left(\\frac{15}{30}\\right)^{30} \\left(\\frac{5000 \\times 0.997}{4970}\\right)^{4970} = (0.5)^{30} \\left(\\frac{4985}{4970}\\right)^{4970}\n$$\nTo compute this value, it is numerically more stable to work with the logarithm:\n$$\n\\ln(B) = 30 \\ln(0.5) + 4970 \\ln\\left(\\frac{4985}{4970}\\right)\n$$\nUsing a calculator for high-precision values:\n$$\n\\ln(0.5) \\approx -0.69314718\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{4985}{4970}\\right) = \\ln(1.00301810865...) \\approx 0.0030135800\n$$\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\n\\ln(B) \\approx 30 \\times (-0.69314718) + 4970 \\times (0.0030135800)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(B) \\approx -20.7944154 + 14.9774926\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(B) \\approx -5.8169228\n$$\nThe bound $B$ is then the exponential of this value:\n$$\nB = \\exp(-5.8169228) \\approx 0.00297687\n$$\nRounding the final numerical bound to four significant figures, we get $0.002977$.",

For any real number $p$, if $L(x)$ is slowly varying, then $(L(x))^p$ is also slowly varying.\n$3$. Any function that converges to a positive constant as $x \\to \\infty$ is slowly varying.\n$4$. The function $\\ln x$ is slowly varying.\n\nLet us analyze the components of $L(x)$:\n- **Component 1**: Consider the function $f_1(x) = \\ln x$. To show it is slowly varying, we evaluate the limit for any $t0$:\n  $$\n  \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\ln(tx)}{\\ln x} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\ln t + \\ln x}{\\ln x} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\left( \\frac{\\ln t}{\\ln x} + 1 \\right) = 0 + 1 = 1\n  $$\n  Since $\\ln x$ is slowly varying, by property $2$, the function $L_1(x) = (\\ln x)^{\\delta}$ is also slowly varying for any $\\delta \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n- **Component 2**: Consider the function $f_2(x) = \\ln(\\ln x)$. To show it is slowly varying, we evaluate the limit for any $t0$:\n  $$\n  \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\ln(\\ln(tx))}{\\ln(\\ln x)} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\ln(\\ln t + \\ln x)}{\\ln(\\ln x)} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\ln x \\left(1 + \\frac{\\ln t}{\\ln x}\\right)\\right)}{\\ln(\\ln x)}\n  $$\n  $$\n  = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\ln(\\ln x) + \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{\\ln t}{\\ln x}\\right)}{\\ln(\\ln x)} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{\\ln t}{\\ln x}\\right)}{\\ln(\\ln x)}\\right)\n  $$\n  As $x \\to \\infty$, $\\ln x \\to \\infty$, so $\\frac{\\ln t}{\\ln x} \\to 0$. This implies $\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{\\ln t}{\\ln x}\\right) \\to \\ln(1) = 0$. The denominator $\\ln(\\ln x) \\to \\infty$. Thus, the fraction goes to $0$, and the total limit is $1$. Since $\\ln(\\ln x)$ is slowly varying, by property $2$, the function $L_2(x) = (\\ln(\\ln x))^{\\eta}$ is also slowly varying for any $\\eta \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n- **Component 3**: Consider the function $L_3(x) = 1 + \\frac{1}{\\ln x}$. We evaluate its limit as $x \\to \\infty$:\n  $$\n  \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\ln x}\\right) = 1+0 = 1\n  $$\n  Since the function converges to a positive constant ($1$), by property $3$, it is slowly varying.\n\nSince $L(x)$ is the product of three slowly varying functions, $L(x) = L_1(x) L_2(x) L_3(x)$, it is itself a slowly varying function by property $1$.\n\nWe have successfully expressed the survival function in the form $\\overline{F}(x) = x^{-\\alpha} L(x)$, where $L(x)$ is a slowly varying function. By comparing\n$$\n\\overline{F}(x) = x^{-7/3} L(x)\n$$\nwith the general form $\\overline{F}(x) = x^{-\\alpha} L(x)$, we can directly identify the tail index $\\alpha$.\n\nThe tail index is $\\alpha = 7/3$.",
