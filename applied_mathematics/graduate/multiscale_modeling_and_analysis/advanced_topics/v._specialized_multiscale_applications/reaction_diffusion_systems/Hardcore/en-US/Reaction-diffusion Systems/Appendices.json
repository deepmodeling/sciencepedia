This practice uses the powerful technique of nondimensionalization to reveal the intrinsic time scales of a system. By comparing the characteristic time for a substance to diffuse across a domain with the time it takes to react, you will derive a critical dimensionless number that dictates whether the system's dynamics are governed by spatial transport or local chemical kinetics .",

            "problem": "Consider a species with concentration field $u(x,t)$ evolving on the interval $(0,L)$ under diffusion with diffusivity $D$ and a first-order decay reaction with rate constant $k$, governed by the partial differential equation $u_t = D u_{xx} - k u$ for $x \\in (0,L)$ and $t \\geq 0$, with initial condition $u(x,0) = u_0(x)$ where $u_0$ is a bounded function.

            "solution": "The validity of the problem statement is established as follows.\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   Governing partial differential equation (PDE): $u_t = D u_{xx} - k u$\n-   Domain: $x \\in (0,L)$, $t \\geq 0$\n-   State variable: $u(x,t)$ is the concentration field.\n-   Constants: Diffusivity $D  0$, reaction rate constant $k  0$, domain length $L  0$.\n-   Initial condition: $u(x,0) = u_0(x)$, where $u_0$ is a bounded function.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem describes a linear reaction-diffusion process, a fundamental and well-established model in numerous STEM fields. The equation is a standard representation of diffusion coupled with first-order decay.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem asks for a scaling analysis, not a full solution to the PDE. For this purpose, the provided information is sufficient. The length scale $L$ is given, which is necessary for nondimensionalizing the spatial variable. The problem is self-contained and structured to lead to a unique result for the requested dimensionless parameter.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise mathematical language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe analysis begins by nondimensionalizing the governing PDE, $u_t = D u_{xx} - k u$, to identify the natural scales of the system. We introduce the following dimensionless variables, where variables with a tilde ($\\tilde{\\cdot}$) are dimensionless, and the subscripted variables ($u_c, x_c, t_c$) are the characteristic scales for concentration, length, and time, respectively.\n\nLet $\\tilde{u} = \\frac{u}{u_c}$, $\\tilde{x} = \\frac{x}{x_c}$, and $\\tilde{t} = \\frac{t}{t_c}$.\n\nThe characteristic length scale is naturally the size of the domain, so we set $x_c = L$. The characteristic concentration scale $u_c$ can be chosen based on the initial condition, for example, $u_c = \\sup|u_0(x)|$. The characteristic time scale $t_c$ is what we seek to determine.\n\nWe transform the derivatives from $(x, t)$ coordinates to $(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{t})$ coordinates using the chain rule:\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial (u_c \\tilde{u})}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} \\frac{d\\tilde{t}}{dt} = u_c \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{u}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} \\frac{1}{t_c} = \\frac{u_c}{t_c} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{u}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}}$\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial (u_c \\tilde{u})}{\\partial \\tilde{x}} \\frac{d\\tilde{x}}{dx} = u_c \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{u}}{\\partial \\tilde{x}} \\frac{1}{L} = \\frac{u_c}{L} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{u}}{\\partial \\tilde{x}}$\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\frac{u_c}{L} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{u}}{\\partial \\tilde{x}} \\right) = \\frac{u_c}{L} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\tilde{u}}{\\partial \\tilde{x}^2} \\frac{d\\tilde{x}}{dx} = \\frac{u_c}{L^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\tilde{u}}{\\partial \\tilde{x}^2}$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the original PDE:\n$\\frac{u_c}{t_c} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{u}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} = D \\left( \\frac{u_c}{L^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\tilde{u}}{\\partial \\tilde{x}^2} \\right) - k (u_c \\tilde{u})$\n\nAssuming a non-trivial concentration scale ($u_c \\neq 0$), we can divide the entire equation by $u_c$ and then multiply by $t_c$ to isolate the dimensionless time derivative:\n$\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{u}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} = \\left( \\frac{D t_c}{L^2} \\right) \\frac{\\partial^2 \\tilde{u}}{\\partial \\tilde{x}^2} - (k t_c) \\tilde{u}$\n\nThis equation contains two dimensionless groups: $(\\frac{D t_c}{L^2})$ and $(k t_c)$. Characteristic time scales are defined by choosing $t_c$ such that the temporal change (left-hand side) is balanced by one of the physical processes on the right-hand side. This corresponds to setting one of the dimensionless coefficients to unity.\n\n**Characteristic Diffusive Time Scale ($\\tau_D$)**\nTo find the time scale characteristic of diffusion, we balance the time derivative term with the diffusion term. This means we set the coefficient of the dimensionless diffusion term to $1$:\n$\\frac{D t_c}{L^2} = 1$\nSolving for $t_c$ gives the diffusive time scale, which we denote as $\\tau_D$:\n$\\tau_D = \\frac{L^2}{D}$\nPhysically, this is the time it takes for a particle to diffuse across the characteristic length $L$.\n\n**Characteristic Reactive Time Scale ($\\tau_R$)**\nTo find the time scale characteristic of the reaction, we balance the time derivative term with the reaction term. This means we set the coefficient of the dimensionless reaction term to $1$:\n$k t_c = 1$\nSolving for $t_c$ gives the reactive time scale, which we denote as $\\tau_R$:\n$\\tau_R = \\frac{1}{k}$\nPhysically, this is the inverse of the first-order rate constant, representing the mean lifetime of the species before it decays.\n\n**Dimensionless Parameter and Asymptotic Regimes**\nThe problem asks for the dimensionless ratio of the diffusive time scale to the reaction time scale. We compute this ratio directly:\n$\\frac{\\tau_D}{\\tau_R} = \\frac{L^2/D}{1/k} = \\frac{k L^2}{D}$\n\nThis dimensionless number, often referred to as a Damköhler number, compares the rate of reaction to the rate of diffusion. To classify the system's behavior, we analyze the nondimensionalized equation by choosing one of the time scales. Let's scale time by the diffusive time scale, i.e., set $t_c = \\tau_D = L^2/D$. The nondimensional PDE becomes:\n$\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{u}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\tilde{u}}{\\partial \\tilde{x}^2} - \\left( \\frac{k L^2}{D} \\right) \\tilde{u}$\n\n-   **Diffusion-Dominated Regime**: If reaction is slow compared to diffusion, the reactive time scale is long compared to the diffusive time scale ($\\tau_R \\gg \\tau_D$). This corresponds to the dimensionless ratio being small: $\\frac{\\tau_D}{\\tau_R} = \\frac{k L^2}{D} \\ll 1$. In this case, the last term in the equation is negligible, and the system behaves like a pure diffusion process: $\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{u}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} \\approx \\frac{\\partial^2 \\tilde{u}}{\\partial \\tilde{x}^2}$.\n\n-   **Reaction-Dominated Regime**: If reaction is fast compared to diffusion, the reactive time scale is short compared to the diffusive time scale ($\\tau_R \\ll \\tau_D$). This corresponds to the dimensionless ratio being large: $\\frac{\\tau_D}{\\tau_R} = \\frac{k L^2}{D} \\gg 1$. In this case, the reaction term dominates the diffusion term. The concentration at each point decays rapidly before diffusion can smooth out spatial gradients. The behavior approaches a set of independent ordinary differential equations at each point $\\tilde{x}$: $\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{u}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} \\approx -\\left(\\frac{k L^2}{D}\\right) \\tilde{u}$.\n\nThe final answer is the expression for the ratio of the diffusive time scale to the reactive time scale.",

            "solution": "The starting point is the two-species reaction-diffusion system described by the vector equation:\n$$\n\\partial_t w = D \\,\\partial_{xx} w + R(w)\n$$\nwhere $w(x,t) = (u(x,t), v(x,t))^{\\top}$, $D = \\mathrm{diag}(D_u, D_v)$ is the diagonal diffusion matrix, and $R(w)$ is the reaction term.\n\nWe are given a spatially homogeneous fixed point $w^{\\ast}$ such that $R(w^{\\ast}) = 0$. To analyze the linear stability of this fixed point, we consider small perturbations $\\eta(x,t)$ by setting $w(x,t) = w^{\\ast} + \\eta(x,t)$. Substituting this into the governing equation and linearizing around $w^{\\ast}$ yields the equation for the perturbation $\\eta$:\n$$\n\\partial_t \\eta = D \\,\\partial_{xx} \\eta + J \\eta\n$$\nwhere $J$ is the Jacobian matrix of the reaction term $R(w)$ evaluated at the fixed point $w^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nJ = \\begin{pmatrix} f_u  f_v \\\\ g_u  g_v \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nHere, the entries are the partial derivatives of the components of $R$, e.g., $f_u = \\partial R_1 / \\partial u$ evaluated at $w^{\\ast}$.\n\nTo find the dispersion relation, we seek solutions in the form of spatial Fourier modes:\n$$\n\\eta(x,t) = \\hat{\\eta} \\exp(i k x + \\lambda t)\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the spatial wavenumber, $\\lambda$ is the temporal growth rate, and $\\hat{\\eta}$ is the constant amplitude vector.

The matrix of the eigenvalue problem is $M(k) = J - k^2 D$:\n$$\nM(k) = \\begin{pmatrix} f_u - k^2 D_u  f_v \\\\ g_u  g_v - k^2 D_v \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe characteristic equation is $\\lambda^2 - \\mathrm{Tr}(M(k))\\lambda + \\det(M(k)) = 0$. This equation is the dispersion relation, linking the growth rate $\\lambda$ to the wavenumber $k$.\n\nThe trace and determinant of $M(k)$ are:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}(M(k)) = (f_u - k^2 D_u) + (g_v - k^2 D_v) = (f_u + g_v) - k^2(D_u + D_v) = \\tau - k^2(D_u + D_v)\n$$\n$$\n\\det(M(k)) = (f_u - k^2 D_u)(g_v - k^2 D_v) - f_v g_u = f_u g_v - f_v g_u - k^2(f_u D_v + g_v D_u) + k^4 D_u D_v = \\Delta - k^2(f_u D_v + g_v D_u) + k^4 D_u D_v\n$$\nwhere $\\tau = f_u + g_v$ and $\\Delta = f_u g_v - f_v g_u$ are the trace and determinant of the Jacobian $J$, respectively.\n\nThe problem states that the spatially homogeneous fixed point is stable to spatially uniform perturbations ($k=0$). This implies that for $k=0$, the real parts of both eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are negative. The conditions for this in a $2$-dimensional system are $\\tau  0$ and $\\Delta  0$.\n\nA stationary Turing instability occurs when diffusion destabilizes this fixed point for a non-zero wavenumber, $k \\neq 0$. The onset of this instability is stationary, meaning the imaginary part of the eigenvalue is zero ($\\mathrm{Im}(\\lambda) = 0$). The instability arises when the leading real eigenvalue, $\\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda_+(k))$, crosses zero from negative to positive. From the characteristic equation, the eigenvalues are given by $\\lambda_{\\pm}(k) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathrm{Tr}(M(k)) \\pm \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Tr}(M(k))^2 - 4\\det(M(k))})$. For a stationary instability, an eigenvalue passes through $\\lambda = 0$.

At the threshold of instability, the minimum value of $\\det(M(k))$ for $k0$ is exactly zero. The critical wavenumber $k_c$ is the wavenumber at which this minimum occurs.\n\nLet's find the minimum of $\\det(M(k))$ with respect to $k$. For simplicity, let $K = k^2$. The expression for the determinant is a quadratic in $K$:\n$$\nF(K) = (D_u D_v) K^2 - (f_u D_v + g_v D_u) K + \\Delta\n$$\nTo find the minimum, we compute the derivative with respect to $K$ and set it to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dF}{dK} = 2(D_u D_v)K - (f_u D_v + g_v D_u) = 0\n$$\nSolving for $K$ gives the critical value $K_c = k_c^2$:\n$$\nk_c^2 = \\frac{f_u D_v + g_v D_u}{2 D_u D_v}\n$$\nThis gives the square of the critical wavenumber, which is the wavenumber of the most unstable mode at the onset of the Turing instability. For a Turing instability to occur, we must have $k_c^2  0$, which requires $f_u D_v + g_v D_u  0$.\n\nThe problem asks for an expression for the critical wavenumber $k_c$. Taking the principal (positive) square root, we get:\n$$\nk_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{f_u D_v + g_v D_u}{2 D_u D_v}}\n$$\nWe are given the diffusion coefficients $D_u = 1$ and $D_v = 10$.
