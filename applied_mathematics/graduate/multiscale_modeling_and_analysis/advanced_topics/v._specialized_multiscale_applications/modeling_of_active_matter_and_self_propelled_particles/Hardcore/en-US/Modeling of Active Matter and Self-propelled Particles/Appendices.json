The provided information is sufficient and consistent for deriving the requested quantities. The assumption of stationarity is consistent with the initial orientation being drawn from the stationary distribution (uniform on the circle) of the renewal process.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The solution will now be derived.\n\nThe displacement of the particle at time $t$ is given by $\\Delta\\mathbf{r}(t) = \\mathbf{r}(t) - \\mathbf{r}(0)$. With the initial condition $\\mathbf{r}(0)=\\mathbf{0}$, the displacement is simply $\\mathbf{r}(t)$. The velocity of the particle is $\\mathbf{v}(t) = v_0 \\mathbf{e}(t)$, where $v_0$ is the constant speed and $\\mathbf{e}(t)$ is the time-dependent orientation unit vector. The position is the time integral of the velocity:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}(t) = \\int_0^t \\mathbf{v}(t') dt' = v_0 \\int_0^t \\mathbf{e}(t') dt'\n$$\nThe mean-squared displacement (MSD) is the ensemble average of the squared magnitude of the displacement vector:\n$$\n\\langle|\\Delta\\mathbf{r}(t)|^2\\rangle = \\langle |\\mathbf{r}(t)|^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\mathbf{r}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}(t) \\rangle\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mathbf{r}(t)$:\n$$\n\\langle|\\mathbf{r}(t)|^2\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\left( v_0 \\int_0^t \\mathbf{e}(t') dt' \\right) \\cdot \\left( v_0 \\int_0^t \\mathbf{e}(t'') dt'' \\right) \\right\\rangle\n$$\nBy linearity of the expectation operator, we can move the averaging inside the integrals:\n$$\n\\langle|\\mathbf{r}(t)|^2\\rangle = v_0^2 \\int_0^t dt' \\int_0^t dt'' \\langle \\mathbf{e}(t') \\cdot \\mathbf{e}(t'') \\rangle\n$$\nThe term $\\langle \\mathbf{e}(t') \\cdot \\mathbf{e}(t'') \\rangle$ is the orientation autocorrelation function. As the underlying stochastic process (homogeneous Poisson process for tumbles) is stationary in time, this correlation function depends only on the time difference $\\tau = |t' - t''|$. Let's compute $C(\\tau) = \\langle \\mathbf{e}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}(\\tau) \\rangle$.\n\nThe orientation $\\mathbf{e}(\\tau)$ will be identical to $\\mathbf{e}(0)$ if and only if no tumbles have occurred in the time interval $[0, \\tau]$. The number of tumbles in this interval follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\alpha\\tau$. The probability of zero tumbles is $P(0, \\tau) = \\exp(-\\alpha\\tau)$.\nIf one or more tumbles occur, the memory of the initial orientation is lost because the new orientation is chosen isotropically and independently of the previous one. Let's denote the new orientation after a tumble by $\\mathbf{e}_{\\text{new}}$. Its average dot product with any fixed vector, such as $\\mathbf{e}(0)$, is zero due to isotropy: $\\langle \\mathbf{e}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_{\\text{new}} \\rangle = 0$.\n\nWe can therefore express the correlation function by conditioning on the number of tumbles in $[0, \\tau]$:\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbf{e}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}(\\tau) \\rangle = \\langle \\mathbf{e}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}(\\tau) | \\text{no tumble} \\rangle P(\\text{no tumble}) + \\langle \\mathbf{e}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}(\\tau) | \\text{at least one tumble} \\rangle P(\\text{at least one tumble})\n$$\nIf there are no tumbles, $\\mathbf{e}(\\tau) = \\mathbf{e}(0)$, so $\\mathbf{e}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}(\\tau) = |\\mathbf{e}(0)|^2 = 1$. The probability of this is $\\exp(-\\alpha\\tau)$.\nIf there is at least one tumble, the orientation at time $\\tau$ is independent of $\\mathbf{e}(0)$, so the expectation of the dot product is $0$.\nThus, the orientation autocorrelation function is:\n$$\nC(\\tau) = \\langle \\mathbf{e}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}(\\tau) \\rangle = (1) \\cdot \\exp(-\\alpha\\tau) + (0) \\cdot (1 - \\exp(-\\alpha\\tau)) = \\exp(-\\alpha\\tau)\n$$\nSo, $\\langle \\mathbf{e}(t') \\cdot \\mathbf{e}(t'') \\rangle = \\exp(-\\alpha|t' - t''|)$.\n\nNow we return to the MSD integral:\n$$\n\\langle|\\mathbf{r}(t)|^2\\rangle = v_0^2 \\int_0^t dt' \\int_0^t dt'' \\exp(-\\alpha|t' - t''|)\n$$\nWe can split the square domain of integration $t', t'' \\in [0, t]$ into two triangles: one where $t'  t''$ and one where $t''  t'$. By symmetry, the integrals over these two regions are equal.\n$$\n\\langle|\\mathbf{r}(t)|^2\\rangle = 2 v_0^2 \\int_0^t dt' \\int_0^{t'} dt'' \\exp(-\\alpha(t' - t''))\n$$\nFirst, we evaluate the inner integral with respect to $t''$:\n$$\n\\int_0^{t'} \\exp(-\\alpha(t' - t'')) dt'' = \\exp(-\\alpha t') \\int_0^{t'} \\exp(\\alpha t'') dt'' = \\exp(-\\alpha t') \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\exp(\\alpha t'') \\right]_0^{t'}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{\\exp(-\\alpha t')}{\\alpha} (\\exp(\\alpha t') - \\exp(0)) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha t'))\n$$\nNext, we evaluate the outer integral with respect to $t'$:\n$$\n\\langle|\\mathbf{r}(t)|^2\\rangle = 2 v_0^2 \\int_0^t \\frac{1}{\\alpha}(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha t')) dt' = \\frac{2v_0^2}{\\alpha} \\int_0^t (1 - \\exp(-\\alpha t')) dt'\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{2v_0^2}{\\alpha} \\left[ t' - \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\right)\\exp(-\\alpha t') \\right]_0^t = \\frac{2v_0^2}{\\alpha} \\left[ t' + \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\exp(-\\alpha t') \\right]_0^t\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{2v_0^2}{\\alpha} \\left( \\left(t + \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\exp(-\\alpha t)\\right) - \\left(0 + \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\exp(0)\\right) \\right) = \\frac{2v_0^2}{\\alpha} \\left( t + \\frac{1}{\\alpha}(\\exp(-\\alpha t) - 1) \\right)\n$$\nRearranging this gives the final expression for the MSD:\n$$\n\\langle|\\Delta\\mathbf{r}(t)|^2\\rangle = \\frac{2v_0^2}{\\alpha^2}(\\alpha t - 1 + \\exp(-\\alpha t))\n$$\nTo find the effective long-time diffusivity $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, we examine the behavior of the MSD as $t \\to \\infty$. In this limit, the $\\exp(-\\alpha t)$ term vanishes:\n$$\n\\langle|\\Delta\\mathbf{r}(t)|^2\\rangle \\sim \\frac{2v_0^2}{\\alpha^2}(\\alpha t - 1) = \\frac{2v_0^2}{\\alpha}t - \\frac{2v_0^2}{\\alpha^2} \\quad \\text{for } t \\to \\infty\n$$\nThe long-time behavior is linear in $t$, which is characteristic of diffusive motion. For diffusion in $d$ dimensions, the MSD takes the form $\\langle|\\Delta\\mathbf{r}(t)|^2\\rangle \\sim 2d D_{\\mathrm{eff}} t$. In our case, the dimension is $d=2$. Therefore, we match the leading-order term with $4D_{\\mathrm{eff}}t$:\n$$\n4 D_{\\mathrm{eff}} t = \\frac{2v_0^2}{\\alpha} t\n$$\nSolving for $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ yields:\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{2v_0^2}{4\\alpha} = \\frac{v_0^2}{2\\alpha}\n$$\nThe two required quantities have been derived from first principles.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes the standard Active Ornstein–Uhlenbeck Particle (AOUP) model, a cornerstone of active matter physics, and asks for the derivation of a validity parameter for a standard approximation technique (UCNA) applied to this model. All terms are clearly defined, and the premises are physically and mathematically sound. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe Unified Colored Noise Approximation (UCNA) is a method to derive an effective Fokker-Planck or Langevin equation for a slow variable whose dynamics are coupled to a fast, noisy process. In this problem, the slow variable is the particle's position $\\mathbf{r}(t)$, and the fast variable is the self-propulsion velocity $\\mathbf{v}(t)$, which is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with correlation time $\\tau$. The fundamental condition for the validity of such an adiabatic elimination is that the characteristic time scale of the fast variable, $\\tau$, must be significantly smaller than any relevant time scale governing the evolution of the slow variable. We must therefore identify the characteristic time scales of the position dynamics induced by the confining potential $U(\\mathbf{r})$.\n\nThe evolution of the particle's position is given by:\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}(t) = -\\mu \\nabla U(\\mathbf{r}(t)) + \\mathbf{v}(t)\n$$\nwhere $\\mu \\equiv 1/\\gamma$ is the mobility. The dynamics of $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ are influenced by two main factors related to the potential: the local force $-\\nabla U$ and its spatial variation.\n\n1.  **Time Scale from Potential Curvature:**\n    Let us analyze the dynamics in the boundary layer $\\mathcal{W}$, where the pressure is determined. We consider the local relaxation of the particle's position under the influence of the potential. By linearizing the force $-\\nabla U(\\mathbf{r})$ around a point $\\mathbf{r}_0 \\in \\mathcal{W}$, we can identify a characteristic time scale. Let $\\delta\\mathbf{r}(t) = \\mathbf{r}(t) - \\mathbf{r}_0$. The force is approximately:\n    $$\n    -\\nabla U(\\mathbf{r}) \\approx -\\nabla U(\\mathbf{r}_0) - H(\\mathbf{r}_0)\\,\\delta\\mathbf{r}(t)\n    $$\n    where $H(\\mathbf{r}_0) = \\nabla\\nabla U(\\mathbf{r}_0)$ is the Hessian matrix evaluated at $\\mathbf{r}_0$. The linearized equation for the position fluctuation is:\n    $$\n    \\delta\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}(t) \\approx -\\mu H(\\mathbf{r}_0)\\,\\delta\\mathbf{r}(t) + (\\mathbf{v}(t) - \\mu\\nabla U(\\mathbf{r}_0))\n    $$\n    The term $-\\mu H(\\mathbf{r}_0)\\,\\delta\\mathbf{r}(t)$ drives the relaxation of the position towards a local mechanical equilibrium. The rates of this relaxation process are given by the eigenvalues of the matrix $\\mu H(\\mathbf{r}_0)$. The fastest relaxation mode corresponds to the largest eigenvalue of this matrix, $\\mu \\lambda_{\\max}(H(\\mathbf{r}_0))$. The associated time scale is the inverse of this rate, $T_{\\text{relax}}(\\mathbf{r}_0) = (\\mu \\lambda_{\\max}(H(\\mathbf{r}_0)))^{-1}$.\n    The adiabatic approximation requires that the velocity correlation time $\\tau$ is much shorter than the fastest possible positional relaxation time in the entire boundary layer $\\mathcal{W}$. This imposes the condition:\n    $$\n    \\tau \\ll \\inf_{\\mathbf{r} \\in \\mathcal{W}} T_{\\text{relax}}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{\\sup_{\\mathbf{r} \\in \\mathcal{W}} (\\mu \\lambda_{\\max}(H(\\mathbf{r})))}\n    $$\n    Using the provided definition $\\Lambda \\equiv \\sup_{\\mathbf{r}\\in \\mathcal{W}} \\lambda_{\\max}(H(\\mathbf{r}))$, this condition becomes $\\tau \\ll (\\mu\\Lambda)^{-1}$. This gives rise to a first dimensionless parameter that must be small:\n    $$\n    \\epsilon_1 = \\tau \\mu \\Lambda\n    $$\n\n2.  **Time Scale from Spatial Variation of Curvature:**\n    The previous analysis assumed that the Hessian $H(\\mathbf{r})$ is constant. However, as the particle moves, the local curvature of the potential it experiences changes. The UCNA implicitly assumes that the environment, as characterized by $H(\\mathbf{r})$, is quasi-static over the velocity correlation time $\\tau$. We must quantify the time scale over which $H(\\mathbf{r})$ varies due to the particle's self-propulsion.\n    The rate of change of the Hessian experienced by a moving particle is $\\frac{d}{dt} H(\\mathbf{r}(t)) = (\\nabla H(\\mathbf{r}(t))) \\cdot \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}(t)$. The particle's instantaneous velocity is dominated by its self-propulsion, so a characteristic speed is $v_{\\text{char}} \\sim \\sqrt{\\langle \\mathbf{v}^2 \\rangle}$. Since $\\langle v_i^2 \\rangle = D_v$ for each component, a characteristic speed is of order $\\sqrt{D_v}$.\n    During the time interval $\\tau$, the particle travels a characteristic distance known as the run length, $\\ell_p = \\tau \\sqrt{D_v}$. Over this distance, the Hessian changes by an amount $\\Delta H$ whose magnitude can be estimated as:\n    $$\n    \\|\\Delta H\\| \\sim \\|\\nabla H\\| \\times (\\text{distance}) \\sim \\|\\nabla H\\| \\ell_p\n    $$\n    For the quasi-static assumption to hold, the relative change in the Hessian over the time $\\tau$ must be small. We compare the magnitude of the change, $\\|\\Delta H\\|$, to the magnitude of the Hessian itself, $\\|H\\|$. The characteristic time scale, $T_\\Gamma$, for the Hessian to change by an amount comparable to itself is:\n    $$\n    T_{\\Gamma} \\sim \\frac{\\|H\\|}{\\|\\frac{d}{dt}H\\|} \\sim \\frac{\\|H\\|}{\\|\\nabla H\\| v_{\\text{char}}}\n    $$\n    Taking the \"worst-case\" values from the boundary layer using the definitions of $\\Lambda$ and $\\Gamma$:\n    $$\n    T_{\\Gamma} \\sim \\frac{\\Lambda}{\\Gamma \\sqrt{D_v}}\n    $$\n    The adiabatic condition requires $\\tau \\ll T_{\\Gamma}$. This yields a second dimensionless parameter that must be small:\n    $$\n    \\epsilon_2 = \\frac{\\tau}{T_\\Gamma} = \\frac{\\tau \\Gamma \\sqrt{D_v}}{\\Lambda}\n    $$\n\n3.  **The Combined Control Parameter:**\n    The validity of the UCNA depends on satisfying both conditions simultaneously: $\\epsilon_1 \\ll 1$ and $\\epsilon_2 \\ll 1$. A single dimensionless control parameter $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{UCNA}}$ whose smallness guarantees the validity of the approximation can be constructed by combining these two requirements. Since both $\\epsilon_1$ and $\\epsilon_2$ are positive quantities, their sum serves as a suitable parameter. If $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{UCNA}} = \\epsilon_1 + \\epsilon_2 \\ll 1$, then necessarily both individual conditions are met.\n    Thus, the dimensionless control parameter is:\n    $$\n    \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{UCNA}} = \\epsilon_1 + \\epsilon_2 = \\tau \\mu \\Lambda + \\frac{\\tau \\Gamma \\sqrt{D_v}}{\\Lambda}\n    $$\n    This expression can be factored to give the final form:\n    $$\n    \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{UCNA}} = \\tau \\left( \\mu \\Lambda + \\frac{\\Gamma \\sqrt{D_v}}{\\Lambda} \\right)\n    $$\n    This parameter correctly captures the competition between the active persistence time $\\tau$ and the characteristic time scales set by the potential's curvature ($\\Lambda$) and its spatial variation ($\\Gamma$), as felt by a particle with mobility $\\mu$ and active velocity scale $\\sqrt{D_v}$.",

Compute the ratio of the mean-squared displacement per step to its theoretical value $4 D_t \\Delta t$ in two dimensions for both Euler–Maruyama and your designed scheme, i.e.,\n   $$\n   r_{\\mathrm{EM}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{MSD}_{\\mathrm{EM}}}{4 D_t \\Delta t}, \\quad r_{\\mathrm{scheme}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{MSD}_{\\mathrm{scheme}}}{4 D_t \\Delta t}.\n   $$\n4. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, ordered as follows for the above test suite:\n   $$\n   [\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{EM}}(0.01), \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{scheme}}(0.01), \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{EM}}(0.5), \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{scheme}}(0.5), \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{EM}}(1.9), \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{scheme}}(1.9), r_{\\mathrm{EM}}, r_{\\mathrm{scheme}}].\n   $$\nAll angles must be treated in radians.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts, corresponding to the tasks defined in the problem statement.\n\n#### Part 1: Stationary Variance of the Euler–Maruyama Scheme\n\nWe consider the passive limit ($v_0 \\to 0$) in the harmonic potential $U(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{k}{2} \\|\\mathbf{x}\\|^2$. The force is $\\mathbf{F} = -\\nabla U(\\mathbf{x}) = -k\\mathbf{x}$. The Langevin equation for the position $\\mathbf{x}$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = -\\mu k \\mathbf{x} + \\sqrt{2 D_t} \\boldsymbol{\\xi}(t)\n$$\nThis vector equation decouples into two identical, independent equations for the Cartesian components $x$ and $y$. Let's analyze one component, $x(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = -\\lambda x + \\sqrt{2 D_t} \\xi_x(t)\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda = \\mu k$ is the relaxation rate and $\\xi_x(t)$ is a one-dimensional standard Gaussian white noise. This is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.\n\nThe Euler–Maruyama discretization of this stochastic differential equation with a time step $\\Delta t$ is:\n$$\nx_{n+1} = x_n - \\lambda x_n \\Delta t + \\sqrt{2 D_t \\Delta t} \\mathcal{N}_n\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{N}_n$ is a random number drawn from a standard normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. We can rewrite this as:\n$$\nx_{n+1} = (1 - \\lambda \\Delta t) x_n + \\sqrt{2 D_t \\Delta t} \\mathcal{N}_n\n$$\nTo find the stationary variance, $\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{EM}}$, we assume the process has reached a stationary state, such that $\\mathrm{Var}[x_{n+1}] = \\mathrm{Var}[x_n] = \\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{EM}}$. The mean is $\\mathrm{E}[x_n] = 0$.\nTaking the variance of both sides and using the fact that $x_n$ and the noise term $\\mathcal{N}_n$ are independent:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}[x_{n+1}] = \\mathrm{Var}[(1 - \\lambda \\Delta t) x_n] + \\mathrm{Var}[\\sqrt{2 D_t \\Delta t} \\mathcal{N}_n]\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{EM}} = (1 - \\lambda \\Delta t)^2 \\mathrm{Var}[x_n] + (2 D_t \\Delta t) \\mathrm{Var}[\\mathcal{N}_n]\n$$\nSince $\\mathrm{Var}[\\mathcal{N}_n] = 1$ and $\\mathrm{Var}[x_n] = \\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{EM}}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{EM}} = (1 - \\lambda \\Delta t)^2 \\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{EM}} + 2 D_t \\Delta t\n$$\nSolving for $\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{EM}}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{EM}} \\left[ 1 - (1 - \\lambda \\Delta t)^2 \\right] = 2 D_t \\Delta t\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{EM}} \\left[ 1 - (1 - 2\\lambda \\Delta t + \\lambda^2 \\Delta t^2) \\right] = 2 D_t \\Delta t\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{EM}} \\left[ 2\\lambda \\Delta t - \\lambda^2 \\Delta t^2 \\right] = 2 D_t \\Delta t\n$$\nAssuming $\\Delta t  0$, we can divide by $\\Delta t$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{EM}} (2\\lambda - \\lambda^2 \\Delta t) = 2 D_t\n$$\nThis gives the stationary variance produced by the Euler–Maruyama scheme:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{EM}} = \\frac{2 D_t}{2\\lambda - \\lambda^2 \\Delta t} = \\frac{D_t}{\\lambda (1 - \\frac{\\lambda \\Delta t}{2})}\n$$\nThe scheme is stable only for $1 - \\frac{\\lambda \\Delta t}{2}  0$, i.e., $\\Delta t  2/\\lambda$.\nThe exact equilibrium variance is $\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{k}$. Using the given relations $D_t = \\mu k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$ and $\\lambda = \\mu k$, we can write $\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{D_t/\\mu}{\\lambda/\\mu} = \\frac{D_t}{\\lambda}$.\nThus, the variance from the Euler-Maruyama scheme is $\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{EM}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{1 - \\frac{\\lambda \\Delta t}{2}}$.\n\n#### Part 2: Design of a Corrected Scheme\nTo design a scheme that preserves the correct passive equilibrium for any finite $\\Delta t$, we use the exact solution of the linear Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process over one time step. The formal solution to $dx = -\\lambda x dt + \\sqrt{2 D_t} dW_t$ from time $t$ to $t+\\Delta t$ is:\n$$\nx(t+\\Delta t) = x(t) e^{-\\lambda \\Delta t} + \\int_t^{t+\\Delta t} e^{-\\lambda(t+\\Delta t - s)} \\sqrt{2 D_t} dW_s\n$$\nThe integral term represents a Gaussian random variable with mean $0$ and variance given by the Itō isometry:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{noise}} = \\int_t^{t+\\Delta t} \\left( e^{-\\lambda(t+\\Delta t - s)} \\sqrt{2 D_t} \\right)^2 ds = 2 D_t \\int_t^{t+\\Delta t} e^{-2\\lambda(t+\\Delta t - s)} ds\n$$\nPerforming the integral yields:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{noise}} = 2 D_t \\left[ \\frac{e^{-2\\lambda(t+\\Delta t - s)}}{2\\lambda} \\right]_t^{t+\\Delta t} = \\frac{D_t}{\\lambda} (1 - e^{-2\\lambda \\Delta t})\n$$\nThis leads to an exact update rule for the passive particle in the harmonic trap:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{x}_n e^{-\\lambda \\Delta t} + \\sqrt{\\frac{D_t}{\\lambda} (1 - e^{-2\\lambda \\Delta t})} \\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{N}}_n\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{N}}_n$ is a $2$-dimensional standard normal random vector. By construction, the stationary variance of this scheme is exactly $\\frac{D_t}{\\lambda} = \\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ for any $\\Delta t  0$.\n\nTo incorporate the active self-propulsion term $v_0 \\mathbf{n}(\\theta)$, we must consistently integrate it over the time step. The full equation is $d\\mathbf{x} = (-\\lambda\\mathbf{x} + v_0\\mathbf{n}(\\theta(t)))dt + \\sqrt{2 D_t} d\\mathbf{W}_t$. Using an integrating factor approach, the active drift contribution over a step $\\Delta t$ can be approximated by assuming the orientation $\\theta$ is constant, $\\theta(s) \\approx \\theta_n$, for $s \\in [t_n, t_{n+1}]$. The integrated term is:\n$$\n\\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} e^{-\\lambda(t_{n+1}-s)} v_0 \\mathbf{n}(\\theta_n) ds = v_0 \\mathbf{n}(\\theta_n) \\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} e^{-\\lambda u} du = \\frac{v_0}{\\lambda} (1 - e^{-\\lambda \\Delta t}) \\mathbf{n}(\\theta_n)\n$$\nThe orientation itself evolves by pure rotational diffusion, for which the Euler-Maruyama update is exact:\n$$\n\\theta_{n+1} = \\theta_n + \\sqrt{2 D_r \\Delta t} \\zeta_n\n$$\nwhere $\\zeta_n \\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$.\n\nThus, the proposed scheme is:\n1.  Update orientation: $\\theta_{n+1} = \\theta_n + \\sqrt{2 D_r \\Delta t} \\zeta_n$\n2.  Update position:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{x}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{x}_n e^{-\\lambda \\Delta t} + \\frac{v_0}{\\lambda} (1 - e^{-\\lambda \\Delta t}) \\mathbf{n}(\\theta_n) + \\sqrt{\\frac{D_t}{\\lambda} (1 - e^{-2\\lambda \\Delta t})} \\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{N}}_n\n    $$\nThis scheme correctly reduces to the passive equilibrium for $v_0 \\to 0$ for all $\\Delta t  0$, and in the limit $\\lambda \\to 0$ (free diffusion), it correctly recovers the standard Euler-Maruyama scheme for ABPs.\n\n#### Part 3: Calculation of Quantitative Measures\n\nWe now compute the requested quantities using the derived formulas with the provided dimensionless parameters.\n\n**A. Harmonic Trap Cases** ($\\mu=1, k_{\\mathrm{B}}T=1, k=1 \\implies D_t=1, \\lambda=1$)\nThe equilibrium variance is $\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{k} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$.\n\n- For $\\Delta t = 0.01$:\n    - $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{EM}}(0.01) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{EM}}}{\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{eq}}} - 1 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\lambda \\Delta t}{2}} - 1 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1 \\cdot 0.01}{2}} - 1 = \\frac{1}{0.995} - 1 = \\frac{0.005}{0.995} \\approx 0.0050251$\n    - $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{scheme}}(0.01) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{scheme}}}{\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{eq}}} - 1 = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{eq}}} - 1 = 0$\n\n- For $\\Delta t = 0.5$:\n    - $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{EM}}(0.5) = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1 \\cdot 0.5}{2}} - 1 = \\frac{1}{0.75} - 1 = \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.333333$\n    - $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{scheme}}(0.5) = 0$\n\n- For $\\Delta t = 1.9$:\n    - $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{EM}}(1.9) = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1 \\cdot 1.9}{2}} - 1 = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.95} - 1 = \\frac{1}{0.05} - 1 = 20 - 1 = 19$\n    - $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{scheme}}(1.9) = 0$\n\n**B. Free Diffusion Edge Case** ($k=0 \\implies \\lambda=0$; also $\\mu=1, k_{\\mathrm{B}}T=1, \\Delta t=1, v_0=0$)\nThe dynamics are $d\\mathbf{x} = \\sqrt{2 D_t} d\\mathbf{W}_t$. The theoretical Mean-Squared Displacement (MSD) in $2$ dimensions is $\\mathrm{MSD}_{\\mathrm{theory}} = 4 D_t \\Delta t$. With $D_t=1$ and $\\Delta t=1$, this is $\\mathrm{MSD}_{\\mathrm{theory}} = 4$.\n\n- For Euler–Maruyama: The scheme for $k=0$ is $\\mathbf{x}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{x}_n + \\sqrt{2 D_t \\Delta t} \\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{N}}_n$. The displacement in one step is $\\Delta\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{x}_{1} - \\mathbf{x}_{0} = \\sqrt{2 D_t \\Delta t} \\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{N}}_0$.\n    - The MSD is $\\mathrm{MSD}_{\\mathrm{EM}} = \\langle \\|\\Delta\\mathbf{x}\\|^2 \\rangle = \\langle (\\sqrt{2 D_t \\Delta t})^2 \\|\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{N}}_0\\|^2 \\rangle = 2 D_t \\Delta t \\langle \\mathcal{N}_x^2 + \\mathcal{N}_y^2 \\rangle$.\n    - Since $\\langle\\mathcal{N}_x^2\\rangle = \\langle\\mathcal{N}_y^2\\rangle = 1$, we get $\\mathrm{MSD}_{\\mathrm{EM}} = 2 D_t \\Delta t (1+1) = 4 D_t \\Delta t$.\n    - The ratio is $r_{\\mathrm{EM}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{MSD}_{\\mathrm{EM}}}{\\mathrm{MSD}_{\\mathrm{theory}}} = \\frac{4 D_t \\Delta t}{4 D_t \\Delta t} = 1$.\n\n- For the designed scheme: We must take the limit as $\\lambda \\to 0$.\n    - The drift factor is $e^{-\\lambda \\Delta t} \\approx 1 - \\lambda \\Delta t$.\n    - The variance of the noise term is $\\frac{D_t}{\\lambda}(1 - e^{-2\\lambda\\Delta t}) \\approx \\frac{D_t}{\\lambda}(1 - (1 - 2\\lambda\\Delta t)) = 2 D_t \\Delta t$.\n    - In the limit $\\lambda=0$, the scheme becomes $\\mathbf{x}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{x}_n + \\sqrt{2 D_t \\Delta t} \\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{N}}_n$, which is identical to the Euler-Maruyama scheme for this case.\n    - Therefore, $\\mathrm{MSD}_{\\mathrm{scheme}} = 4 D_t \\Delta t$ and the ratio is $r_{\\mathrm{scheme}} = 1$.",
