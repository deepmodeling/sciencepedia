This effect is crucial for understanding phenomena like Ostwald ripening and nucleation.\n\nConsider a spherical precipitate of a pure solute phase, denoted as phase $\\beta$, with a radius $r$. This precipitate is embedded within a solid solution matrix, phase $\\alpha$, which contains the same solute. The system is maintained at a constant temperature $T$.\n\n**Background Information:**\n1.  The condition for thermodynamic equilibrium at the interface is that the total Gibbs free energy change, $dG_{total}$, for transferring an infinitesimal amount of solute, $dn$ moles, from the matrix to the precipitate is zero.\n2.  The total free energy change is composed of two parts: the change in the bulk free energy, $dG_{bulk}$, and the change in the surface free energy, $dG_{surface}$.\n    $$dG_{total} = dG_{bulk} + dG_{surface} = 0$$\n3.  The bulk free energy change is given by $dG_{bulk} = (\\mu_{\\beta} - \\mu_{\\alpha}) dn$, where $\\mu_{\\beta}$ is the chemical potential of the pure solute in the precipitate and $\\mu_{\\alpha}$ is the chemical potential of the solute in the matrix at the interface.\n4.  The surface free energy change is given by $dG_{surface} = \\gamma dA$, where $\\gamma$ is the interfacial energy per unit area (surface tension) between the two phases, and $dA$ is the change in the interfacial surface area.\n5.  Assume the precipitate phase has a constant molar volume $\\Omega$.\n6.  The chemical potential of the solute in the matrix, treated as an ideal dilute solution, is related to its concentration $C$ by the expression:\n    $$\\mu_{\\alpha}(C) = \\mu_{0} + k_{B}T \\ln(C)$$\n    where $\\mu_{0}$ is the reference chemical potential and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n7.  For a flat interface ($r \\to \\infty$), the system is at equilibrium when the solute concentration in the matrix is $C_{\\infty}$ and the chemical potentials are equal: $\\mu_{\\alpha}(C_{\\infty}) = \\mu_{\\beta}$.\n\n**Problem:**\nStarting from the condition for thermodynamic equilibrium, derive an expression for the equilibrium solute concentration, $C_r$, at the surface of the spherical precipitate of radius $r$.

The resulting equilibrium shape has the property that its support function, $p(\\theta)$, is directly proportional to the anisotropic line tension, $\\gamma(\\theta)$. The support function $p(\\theta)$ is defined as the signed perpendicular distance from the origin to a tangent line of the boundary curve $\\Gamma$ whose normal vector has orientation $\\theta$.\n\nWe can thus write the support function for any equilibrium shape as:\n$$p(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\gamma(\\theta)$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is a parameter with units of force per unit length (or energy per unit area in $2$D) that determines the size of the nucleus. The shape of the nucleus is fixed by the form of $\\gamma(\\theta)$, and all equilibrium nuclei belong to a one-parameter family scaled by $\\lambda$.\n\n**Step 2: Free Energy as a Function of the Size Parameter**\n\nThe free-energy functional is $\\mathcal{F}[\\Gamma] = \\oint_{\\Gamma} \\gamma(\\theta)\\, ds - \\Delta g\\, \\mathcal{A}[\\Gamma]$. We must express the line energy and area terms as functions of $\\lambda$.\n\nThe element of arclength, $ds$, and the area, $\\mathcal{A}$, can be expressed in terms of the support function $p(\\theta)$ and its derivatives with respect to $\\theta$:\n$$ds = \\big(p(\\theta) + p''(\\theta)\\big) d\\theta$$\n$$\\mathcal{A} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} p(\\theta) \\big(p(\\theta) + p''(\\theta)\\big) d\\theta$$\nThe convexity condition $|\\varepsilon|  1/15$ ensures that the stiffness $\\gamma(\\theta) + \\gamma''(\\theta)  0$, which in turn ensures $p(\\theta) + p''(\\theta)  0$, so the curve is well-defined and convex.\n\nSubstituting $p(\\theta) = \\gamma(\\theta)/\\lambda$ into these expressions:\nThe total line energy is:\n$$\\oint_{\\Gamma} \\gamma(\\theta) ds = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\gamma(\\theta) \\left( \\frac{\\gamma(\\theta)}{\\lambda} + \\frac{\\gamma''(\\theta)}{\\lambda} \\right) d\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\gamma(\\theta) \\big(\\gamma(\\theta) + \\gamma''(\\theta)\\big) d\\theta$$\nThe area is:\n$$\\mathcal{A} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{\\gamma(\\theta)}{\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{\\gamma(\\theta)}{\\lambda} + \\frac{\\gamma''(\\theta)}{\\lambda} \\right) d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2\\lambda^2} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\gamma(\\theta) \\big(\\gamma(\\theta) + \\gamma''(\\theta)\\big) d\\theta$$\n\nLet us define the integral $W$ as:\n$$W = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\gamma(\\theta) \\big(\\gamma(\\theta) + \\gamma''(\\theta)\\big) d\\theta$$\nThe line energy and area can now be written concisely as $2W/\\lambda$ and $W/\\lambda^2$, respectively.\nThe free energy functional becomes a function of the single parameter $\\lambda$:\n$$\\mathcal{F}(\\lambda) = \\frac{2W}{\\lambda} - \\Delta g \\frac{W}{\\lambda^2}$$\n\n**Step 3: Determination of the Critical Nucleus**\n\nThe critical nucleus corresponds to the maximum of the free-energy barrier, which is found by setting the derivative of $\\mathcal{F}(\\lambda)$ with respect to $\\lambda$ to zero:\n$$\\frac{d\\mathcal{F}}{d\\lambda} = -\\frac{2W}{\\lambda^2} + \\frac{2W\\Delta g}{\\lambda^3} = 0$$\nSince $W0$, we can solve for the critical value $\\lambda^*$:\n$$-\\frac{1}{(\\lambda^*)^2} + \\frac{\\Delta g}{(\\lambda^*)^3} = 0 \\implies \\lambda^* = \\Delta g$$\nThis fundamental result states that the size parameter for the critical nucleus is precisely the bulk driving force $\\Delta g$.\nTherefore, the support function for the critical nucleus, denoted $\\Gamma^*$, is:\n$$p^*(\\theta) = \\frac{\\gamma(\\theta)}{\\Delta g}$$\n\n**Step 4: Area of the Critical Nucleus**\n\nThe area of the critical nucleus, $\\mathcal{A}^*$, is found by substituting $\\lambda = \\lambda^* = \\Delta g$ into the expression for the area:\n$$\\mathcal{A}^* = \\frac{W}{(\\Delta g)^2} = \\frac{1}{2(\\Delta g)^2} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\gamma(\\theta) \\big(\\gamma(\\theta) + \\gamma''(\\theta)\\big) d\\theta$$\nWe are given the anisotropic line tension:\n$$\\gamma(\\theta) = \\gamma_{0}\\,\\big(1 + \\varepsilon \\cos(4\\theta)\\big)$$\nIts second derivative is:\n$$\\gamma'(\\theta) = -4\\gamma_{0}\\varepsilon \\sin(4\\theta)$$\n$$\\gamma''(\\theta) = -16\\gamma_{0}\\varepsilon \\cos(4\\theta)$$\nThe term in the integrand is:\n\\begin{align*} \\gamma(\\theta)\\big(\\gamma(\\theta) + \\gamma''(\\theta)\\big) = \\gamma_{0}\\big(1 + \\varepsilon \\cos(4\\theta)\\big) \\left[ \\gamma_{0}\\big(1 + \\varepsilon \\cos(4\\theta)\\big) - 16\\gamma_{0}\\varepsilon \\cos(4\\theta) \\right] \\\\ = \\gamma_0^2 \\big(1 + \\varepsilon \\cos(4\\theta)\\big) \\big(1 - 15\\varepsilon \\cos(4\\theta)\\big) \\\\ = \\gamma_0^2 \\big(1 - 14\\varepsilon \\cos(4\\theta) - 15\\varepsilon^2 \\cos^2(4\\theta)\\big)\\end{align*}\nNow, we perform the integration over $\\theta$ from $0$ to $2\\pi$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = 2\\pi$$\n$$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\cos(4\\theta) d\\theta = \\left[\\frac{\\sin(4\\theta)}{4}\\right]_0^{2\\pi} = 0$$\n$$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\cos^2(4\\theta) d\\theta = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{1+\\cos(8\\theta)}{2} d\\theta = \\left[\\frac{\\theta}{2} + \\frac{\\sin(8\\theta)}{16}\\right]_0^{2\\pi} = \\pi$$\nSubstituting these results back into the integral for $\\mathcal{A}^*$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\gamma(\\theta)\\big(\\gamma(\\theta) + \\gamma''(\\theta)\\big)d\\theta = \\gamma_0^2 \\big(2\\pi - 14\\varepsilon(0) - 15\\varepsilon^2(\\pi)\\big) = \\pi\\gamma_0^2(2-15\\varepsilon^2)$$\nSo, the area of the critical nucleus is:\n$$\\mathcal{A}^* = \\frac{1}{2(\\Delta g)^2} \\left[ \\pi\\gamma_0^2(2-15\\varepsilon^2) \\right] = \\frac{\\pi\\gamma_0^2}{(\\Delta g)^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{15}{2}\\varepsilon^2\\right)$$\n\n**Step 5: Calculation of the Radius Ratio**\n\nThe problem provides the definition for the isotropic critical radius, $r^{*}_{\\mathrm{iso}} = \\gamma_0 / \\Delta g$.
