            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the critical temperature $T_c$ for a Lattice Gas model within the Mean-Field (MF) approximation. The critical temperature marks the onset of instability in the homogeneous (disordered) phase, signaling a transition towards an ordered (phase-separated) state. This instability corresponds to the loss of local convexity of the Helmholtz free energy per site, $f(\\phi, T)$, at the point of symmetry.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three main steps:\n$1$. Construction of the average internal energy per site, $u(\\phi)$, using the MF approximation.\n$2$. Construction of the configurational entropy per site, $s(\\phi)$, using the combinatorial formula for independent site occupancy.\n$3$. Construction of the Helmholtz free energy per site, $f(\\phi, T) = u(\\phi) - T s(\\phi)$, and subsequent stability analysis by examining its second derivative with respect to the order parameter $\\phi$.\n\nFirst, we determine the average internal energy per site, $u(\\phi)$. The model defines an attractive energy contribution of $-\\epsilon$ for each pair of occupied nearest-neighbor sites, where $\\epsilon  0$. For a regular lattice with $N$ sites and coordination number $z$, the total number of nearest-neighbor pairs is $\\frac{Nz}{2}$. The probability that any two specific nearest-neighbor sites, say $i$ and $j$, are both occupied is given by the pair correlation function $\\langle n_i n_j \\rangle$. Within the Mean-Field approximation, this correlation is factorized: $\\langle n_i n_j \\rangle \\approx \\langle n_i \\rangle \\langle n_j \\rangle$. Due to translational invariance, the average occupancy is uniform across all sites, $\\langle n_i \\rangle = \\phi$ for all $i$. Therefore, the probability of an interaction is $\\phi^2$.\n\nThe total average internal energy $U$ of the system is the product of the total number of pairs, the probability of interaction for each pair, and the energy per interaction:\n$$U(\\phi) = \\left(\\frac{Nz}{2}\\right) \\langle n_i n_j \\rangle (-\\epsilon) \\approx \\left(\\frac{Nz}{2}\\right) \\phi^2 (-\\epsilon) = -\\frac{Nz\\epsilon}{2} \\phi^2$$\nThe average internal energy per site, $u(\\phi)$, is then:\n$$u(\\phi) = \\frac{U(\\phi)}{N} = -\\frac{z\\epsilon}{2} \\phi^2$$\n\nNext, we determine the configurational entropy per site, $s(\\phi)$. The system consists of $N$ sites, with $N\\phi$ sites occupied and $N(1-\\phi)$ sites empty. The number of ways, $\\Omega$, to arrange these $N\\phi$ particles on $N$ sites is given by the binomial coefficient:\n$$\\Omega = \\binom{N}{N\\phi} = \\frac{N!}{(N\\phi)![N(1-\\phi)]!}$$\nThe entropy $S$ is given by the Boltzmann formula, $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n$$S(\\phi) = k_B \\ln\\left( \\frac{N!}{(N\\phi)![N(1-\\phi)]!} \\right)$$\nFor a large system ($N \\to \\infty$), we use Stirling's approximation, $\\ln(m!) \\approx m \\ln(m) - m$:\n$$S(\\phi) \\approx k_B \\left[ (N\\ln N - N) - (N\\phi \\ln(N\\phi) - N\\phi) - (N(1-\\phi)\\ln(N(1-\\phi)) - N(1-\\phi)) \\right]$$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$S(\\phi) \\approx k_B \\left[ N\\ln N - N - N\\phi(\\ln N + \\ln\\phi) + N\\phi - N(1-\\phi)(\\ln N + \\ln(1-\\phi)) + N(1-\\phi) \\right]$$\nThe terms $N\\ln N$, $N\\phi \\ln N$, $N(1-\\phi)\\ln N$ cancel, as do the terms $-N$, $+N\\phi$, and $+N(1-\\phi)$.

Below this temperature, the free energy develops two minima away from $\\phi = \\frac{1}{2}$, making phase separation into low-density and high-density regions thermodynamically favorable.",

The FPE is a continuity equation, $\\frac{\\partial c(n,t)}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial J(n,t)}{\\partial n}$, where $J(n,t)$ is the flux of clusters in size space.

The net flux from size $n$ to $n+1$ in the discrete picture is $J_n = f^+(n) c(n) - f^-(n+1) c(n+1)$. In the continuum limit ($n \\gg 1$), this must match the FPE flux $J(n)$. At equilibrium ($J=0$), we have detailed balance: $f^+(n) c_{eq}(n) = f^-(n+1) c_{eq}(n+1)$. The equilibrium distribution is given by the Boltzmann factor, $c_{eq}(n) \\propto \\exp(-\\Delta G(n)/k_B T)$.

It clearly shows $J$'s dependence on the attachment frequency $f^+$, the equilibrium concentration of critical clusters $c_{n^*}$, and the barrier curvature $\\Delta G''(n^*)$, which enters via the so-called Zeldovich factor.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe need to calculate $J$ using the derived formula and the provided parameters.\nFirst, we calculate the forward monomer attachment frequency $f^+$. The problem states that attachment is diffusion-limited. The frequency of monomer attachment to a single critical cluster is given by the product of the diffusion-limited rate constant $k_D$ and the monomer concentration $c_1$:\n$$f^+ = k_D c_1$$\nThe Smoluchowski rate constant for diffusion to a spherical target of radius $R^*$ is $k_D = 4\\pi D R^*$, where $D$ is the monomer diffusion coefficient.\n$$f^+ = 4\\pi D R^* c_1$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$D = 2.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$R^{*} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$c_{1} = 1.0 \\times 10^{24}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n$$f^+ = 4\\pi (2.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) (2.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}) (1.0 \\times 10^{24}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3})$$\n$$f^+ = 4\\pi (5.0 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) (1.0 \\times 10^{24}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}) = 20\\pi \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nNext, we evaluate the Zeldovich factor term $\\sqrt{\\frac{-\\Delta G''(n^*)}{2\\pi k_B T}}$. We are given the dimensionless ratio $\\frac{\\Delta G''(n^{*})}{k_{B}T} = -0.015708$.\nThe numerical value $0.015708$ is a high-precision approximation of $\\pi/200 \\approx 0.01570796$. We assume this intended value for simplicity.\n$$\\sqrt{\\frac{-\\Delta G''(n^*)}{2\\pi k_B T}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{-(\\frac{\\Delta G''(n^*)}{k_B T})}{2\\pi}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{-(-0.015708)}{2\\pi}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi/200}{2\\pi}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{400}} = \\frac{1}{20}$$\nNow, we can calculate the nucleation rate $J$ using the given value $c_{n^{*}} = 1.00 \\times 10^{11}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$.\n$$J = f^+ c_{n^*} \\sqrt{\\frac{-\\Delta G''(n^*)}{2\\pi k_B T}} = (20\\pi \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) (1.00 \\times 10^{11}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}) \\left(\\frac{1}{20}\\right)$$\n$$J = \\pi \\times 10^5 \\times 1.00 \\times 10^{11}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = \\pi \\times 10^{16}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nFinally, we evaluate this numerically and round to $4$ significant figures:\n$$J \\approx 3.14159265... \\times 10^{16}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n$$J \\approx 3.142 \\times 10^{16}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\ \\mathrms^{-1}$$",
            "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.142 \\times 10^{16}}$$"
