There are no contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the activation free energy, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, within the framework of Marcus theory, assuming harmonic free energy surfaces for the reactant (oxidized state, $R$) and product (reduced state, $P$).\n\nLet $q$ be the collective nuclear coordinate. The free energy surfaces for the reactant and product states, $G_R(q)$ and $G_P(q)$, are parabolas of identical curvature. Let the constant of curvature be $c$. We can define the reactant parabola with its minimum at $q=0$ and a reference free energy of $0$:\n$$G_R(q) = c q^2$$\n\nThe product parabola has its minimum shifted to a coordinate $q_P$ and its free energy minimum is $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ relative to the reactant minimum:\n$$G_P(q) = c(q-q_P)^2 + \\Delta G^{\\circ}$$\n\nThe reorganization energy, $\\lambda$, is defined as the energy cost to distort the reactant system from its equilibrium geometry ($q=0$) to the equilibrium geometry of the product state ($q=q_P$) without the electron transfer occurring. Mathematically, this is the energy of the reactant state evaluated at the product's equilibrium coordinate:\n$$\\lambda = G_R(q_P) - G_R(0) = c(q_P)^2 - 0 = c q_P^2$$\n\nThe transition state occurs at the nuclear coordinate $q^{\\ddagger}$ where the two free energy surfaces intersect, i.e., $G_R(q^{\\ddagger}) = G_P(q^{\\ddagger})$. We solve for $q^{\\ddagger}$:\n$$c(q^{\\ddagger})^2 = c(q^{\\ddagger} - q_P)^2 + \\Delta G^{\\circ}$$\n$$c(q^{\\ddagger})^2 = c((q^{\\ddagger})^2 - 2q^{\\ddagger}q_P + q_P^2) + \\Delta G^{\\circ}$$\n$$0 = -2cq^{\\ddagger}q_P + cq_P^2 + \\Delta G^{\\circ}$$\n$$2cq^{\\ddagger}q_P = cq_P^2 + \\Delta G^{\\circ}$$\n\nUsing the definition $\\lambda = cq_P^2$, we can substitute this into the equation:\n$$2cq^{\\ddagger}q_P = \\lambda + \\Delta G^{\\circ}$$\n$$q^{\\ddagger} = \\frac{\\lambda + \\Delta G^{\\circ}}{2cq_P}$$\nWe can also express $2cq_P$ in terms of $\\lambda$. Since $\\lambda = cq_P^2$, we have $q_P = \\sqrt{\\lambda/c}$, which gives $2cq_P = 2c\\sqrt{\\lambda/c} = 2\\sqrt{\\lambda c}$. This is not the most direct path. Instead, we can rearrange the expression for $q^{\\ddagger}$ and substitute $\\lambda = cq_P^2$:\n$$q^{\\ddagger} = q_P\\frac{\\lambda + \\Delta G^{\\circ}}{2cq_P^2} = q_P\\frac{\\lambda + \\Delta G^{\\circ}}{2\\lambda}$$\n\nThe activation free energy, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, is the free energy of the transition state relative to the reactant minimum. It is the value of the reactant's free energy parabola at the crossing point $q^{\\ddagger}$:\n$$\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} = G_R(q^{\\ddagger}) = c(q^{\\ddagger})^2$$\nSubstituting the expression for $q^{\\ddagger}$:\n$$\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} = c \\left( q_P\\frac{\\lambda + \\Delta G^{\\circ}}{2\\lambda} \\right)^2 = c q_P^2 \\frac{(\\lambda + \\Delta G^{\\circ})^2}{4\\lambda^2}$$\n\nAgain, using $\\lambda = cq_P^2$, we arrive at the classic Marcus expression for the activation energy:\n$$\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} = \\lambda \\frac{(\\lambda + \\Delta G^{\\circ})^2}{4\\lambda^2} = \\frac{(\\lambda + \\Delta G^{\\circ})^2}{4\\lambda}$$\nThis is the required analytic expression for the activation free energy.\n\nNext, we compute the electron-transfer rate constant, $k$. The problem states that the rate follows Transition State Theory (TST) with a prefactor $k_0$. The rate constant is given by an Arrhenius-type equation:\n$$k = k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{RT}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$:\n$$k = k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\lambda + \\Delta G^{\\circ})^2}{4\\lambda RT}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values. It is critical to ensure all units are in the SI system for consistency.\n-   $\\lambda = 95\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} = 95000\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n-   $\\Delta G^{\\circ} = -25\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} = -25000\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n-   $k_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n-   $R = 8.314\\,462\\,618\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n-   $T = 298.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless argument of the exponential function, which we denote as $X$:\n$$X = \\frac{(\\lambda + \\Delta G^{\\circ})^2}{4\\lambda RT}$$\n$$X = \\frac{(95000\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} - 25000\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}})^2}{4 \\times (95000\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}) \\times (8.314\\,462\\,618\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (298.15\\ \\mathrm{K})}$$\n$$X = \\frac{(70000\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}})^2}{4 \\times 95000 \\times 8.314\\,462\\,618 \\times 298.15\\ \\mathrm{J^2\\,mol^{-2}}}$$\n$$X = \\frac{4.9 \\times 10^9}{942003284.93...} \\approx 5.2016709$$\n\nNow we can calculate the rate constant $k$:\n$$k = (1.0 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\exp(-X)$$\n$$k = (1.0 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\exp(-5.2016709...)$$\n$$k \\approx (1.0 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\times 0.005507353$$\n$$k \\approx 55073.53\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required:\n$$k \\approx 5.507 \\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$",
