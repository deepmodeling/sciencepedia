Coarse nodes are located at positions $x_{i-1}=x_i - H$, $x_i$, and $x_{i+1}=x_i + H$, where $H0$ is the coarse grid spacing. A patch centered at $x_i$ has half-width $0\\ellH$, so its left and right edges are at $x_{L}=x_i - \\ell$ and $x_{R}=x_i + \\ell$, respectively.

            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard problem in numerical analysis related to multiscale modeling and patch dynamics. All definitions are precise, and the tasks are clearly specified. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. The first is to show an equivalence between a given extrapolated value and a Lagrange interpolating polynomial. The second is to derive the error of this approximation.\n\n**Part 1: Equivalence of $\\widehat{u}(x_{L})$ and the Lagrange interpolating polynomial**\n\nWe are asked to show that the given expression for the extrapolated boundary value at the left patch edge, $\\widehat{u}(x_{L})$, is identical to the value of the quadratic Lagrange interpolating polynomial, let's call it $P_2(x)$, evaluated at $x = x_{L}$. The polynomial $P_2(x)$ is constructed to pass through the three coarse nodal points $(x_{i-1}, u_{i-1})$, $(x_i, u_i)$, and $(x_{i+1}, u_{i+1})$.\n\nFirst, let's write the expression for $\\widehat{u}(x_{L})$ by substituting the definitions of the discrete gradient $g_i$ and curvature $c_i$:\n$$\n\\widehat{u}(x_{L}) = u_i - \\ell\\, g_i + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\ell^{2}\\, c_i = u_i - \\ell \\left( \\frac{u_{i+1}-u_{i-1}}{2H} \\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\ell^{2} \\left( \\frac{u_{i+1}-2u_i+u_{i-1}}{H^{2}} \\right).\n$$\nTo facilitate comparison with the Lagrange polynomial, we can rearrange this expression by collecting the coefficients of $u_{i-1}$, $u_i$, and $u_{i+1}$:\n$$\n\\widehat{u}(x_{L}) = u_{i-1} \\left( \\frac{\\ell}{2H} + \\frac{\\ell^2}{2H^2} \\right) + u_i \\left( 1 - \\frac{2\\ell^2}{2H^2} \\right) + u_{i+1} \\left( -\\frac{\\ell}{2H} + \\frac{\\ell^2}{2H^2} \\right).\n$$\nSimplifying the coefficients gives:\n$$\n\\widehat{u}(x_{L}) = u_{i-1} \\left( \\frac{\\ell H + \\ell^2}{2H^2} \\right) + u_i \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\ell^2}{H^2} \\right) + u_{i+1} \\left( \\frac{-\\ell H + \\ell^2}{2H^2} \\right).\n$$\nThis can be factored as:\n$$\n\\widehat{u}(x_{L}) = u_{i-1} \\frac{\\ell(\\ell+H)}{2H^2} + u_i \\frac{H^2-\\ell^2}{H^2} + u_{i+1} \\frac{\\ell(\\ell-H)}{2H^2}. \\quad (*).\n$$\nNow, we construct the quadratic Lagrange interpolating polynomial $P_2(x)$ that passes through the three points $(x_{i-1}, u_{i-1})$, $(x_i, u_i)$, and $(x_{i+1}, u_{i+1})$. The general form is:\n$$\nP_2(x) = u_{i-1} L_{i-1}(x) + u_i L_i(x) + u_{i+1} L_{i+1}(x),\n$$\nwhere $L_{j}(x)$ are the Lagrange basis polynomials. For the nodes $x_{i-1}$, $x_i$, $x_{i+1}$, these are:\n$$\nL_{i-1}(x) = \\frac{(x-x_i)(x-x_{i+1})}{(x_{i-1}-x_i)(x_{i-1}-x_{i+1})},\n$$\n$$\nL_i(x) = \\frac{(x-x_{i-1})(x-x_{i+1})}{(x_i-x_{i-1})(x_i-x_{i+1})},\n$$\n$$\nL_{i+1}(x) = \\frac{(x-x_{i-1})(x-x_i)}{(x_{i+1}-x_{i-1})(x_{i+1}-x_i)}.\n$$\nWe use the given nodal positions: $x_{i-1} = x_i - H$ and $x_{i+1} = x_i + H$. The denominators simplify to:\n$$\n(x_{i-1}-x_i)(x_{i-1}-x_{i+1}) = (-H)(-2H) = 2H^2,\n$$\n$$\n(x_i-x_{i-1})(x_i-x_{i+1}) = (H)(-H) = -H^2,\n$$\n$$\n(x_{i+1}-x_{i-1})(x_{i+1}-x_i) = (2H)(H) = 2H^2.\n$$\nSo the basis polynomials are:\n$$\nL_{i-1}(x) = \\frac{(x-x_i)(x-x_{i+1})}{2H^2},\n$$\n$$\nL_i(x) = \\frac{(x-x_{i-1})(x-x_{i+1})}{-H^2},\n$$\n$$\nL_{i+1}(x) = \\frac{(x-x_{i-1})(x-x_i)}{2H^2}.\n$$\nWe need to evaluate $P_2(x)$ at the left patch edge, $x=x_L=x_i-\\ell$. Let's evaluate the factors $(x_L-x_j)$:\n$$\nx_L - x_{i-1} = (x_i - \\ell) - (x_i - H) = H - \\ell,\n$$\n$$\nx_L - x_i = (x_i - \\ell) - x_i = -\\ell,\n$$\n$$\nx_L - x_{i+1} = (x_i - \\ell) - (x_i + H) = -\\ell - H = -(H+\\ell).\n$$\nNow, we evaluate each basis polynomial at $x=x_L$:\n$$\nL_{i-1}(x_L) = \\frac{(-\\ell)(-(H+\\ell))}{2H^2} = \\frac{\\ell(H+\\ell)}{2H^2},\n$$\n$$\nL_i(x_L) = \\frac{(H-\\ell)(-(H+\\ell))}{-H^2} = \\frac{(H-\\ell)(H+\\ell)}{H^2} = \\frac{H^2-\\ell^2}{H^2},\n$$\n$$\nL_{i+1}(x_L) = \\frac{(H-\\ell)(-\\ell)}{2H^2} = \\frac{\\ell(\\ell-H)}{2H^2}.\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P_2(x_L)$:\n$$\nP_2(x_L) = u_{i-1} \\frac{\\ell(H+\\ell)}{2H^2} + u_i \\frac{H^2-\\ell^2}{H^2} + u_{i+1} \\frac{\\ell(\\ell-H)}{2H^2}.\n$$\nComparing this result with equation $(*)$, we see that the expressions are identical. Thus, we have shown that $\\widehat{u}(x_{L}) = P_2(x_{L})$.\n\n**Part 2: Interpolation Error Expression**\n\nThe second task is to find a closed-form expression for the interpolation error $E_L = u(x_{L}) - \\widehat{u}(x_{L})$.\nFrom Part 1, we know that $\\widehat{u}(x_{L}) = P_2(x_{L})$, where $P_2(x)$ is the quadratic polynomial interpolating $u(x)$ at the points $x_{i-1}$, $x_i$, and $x_{i+1}$. Therefore, the error $E_L$ is the standard polynomial interpolation error.\n\nThe Lagrange remainder theorem for polynomial interpolation states that if a function $u(x)$ is $(n+1)$ times continuously differentiable on an interval $I$ containing the interpolation nodes $x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_n$ and the point $x$, then the error of the degree-$n$ interpolating polynomial $P_n(x)$ is given by:\n$$\nu(x) - P_n(x) = \\frac{u^{(n+1)}(\\xi)}{(n+1)!} \\prod_{j=0}^{n} (x-x_j),\n$$\nfor some $\\xi \\in I$.\n\nIn our case, $n=2$, the interpolation nodes are $x_{i-1}$, $x_i$, $x_{i+1}$, and the function $u(x)$ is given to be three times continuously differentiable ($C^3$) on $[x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}]$. We are evaluating the error at $x=x_L$. Since $0  \\ell  H$, we have $x_{i-1}  x_L  x_i$, so $x_L$ is in the interval $(x_{i-1}, x_{i+1})$. The error formula becomes:\n$$\nE_L = u(x_L) - P_2(x_L) = \\frac{u^{(3)}(\\xi_L)}{3!} (x_L - x_{i-1})(x_L - x_i)(x_L - x_{i+1}),\n$$\nfor some $\\xi_L \\in (x_{i-1}, x_{i+1})$.\n\nWe have already calculated the product term in Part 1:\n$$\n(x_L - x_{i-1})(x_L - x_i)(x_L - x_{i+1}) = (H-\\ell)(-\\ell)(-(H+\\ell)).\n$$\nSimplifying this product:\n$$\n(H-\\ell)(-\\ell)(-(H+\\ell)) = \\ell (H-\\ell)(H+\\ell) = \\ell (H^2 - \\ell^2).\n$$\nThe factorial is $3! = 6$. Substituting these components back into the error expression gives:\n$$\nE_L = \\frac{u^{(3)}(\\xi_L)}{6} \\ell(H^2 - \\ell^2).\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the interpolation error at the left patch edge.",

All criteria for a valid problem are met.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe derivation proceeds by solving the local problem on the patch to determine the relationship between the flux and the macroscopic gradient.\n\nWithin the patch centered at an interface $x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$, the governing equation is the steady-state diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\partial_{x}\\!\\left(D(x)\\,\\partial_{x} u\\right) = 0\n$$\nSince this is an ordinary differential equation in the spatial variable $x$, we can integrate it once to obtain:\n$$\nD(x)\\,\\partial_{x} u(x) = C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. The microscale flux is defined by the constitutive relation $q(x) = -D(x)\\,\\partial_{x} u(x)$. From the integrated equation, we see that the flux within the patch is constant: $q(x) = -C$. The problem states that the coarse flux $F_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$ is defined as this constant microscale flux. Therefore:\n$$\nF_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} = -C\n$$\nTo find the constant $C$, we utilize the constraint provided in the problem statement. First, we express the local gradient $\\partial_{x} u(x)$ from the integrated equation:\n$$\n\\partial_{x} u(x) = \\frac{C}{D(x)}\n$$\nThe constraint requires that the average of this local gradient over the patch equals the coarse-scale gradient, $S_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\delta}\\int_{x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}-\\delta/2}^{x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}+\\delta/2} \\partial_{x} u(x) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = S_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\partial_{x} u(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\delta}\\int_{x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}-\\delta/2}^{x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}+\\delta/2} \\frac{C}{D(x)} \\,\\mathrm{d}x = S_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$\nSince $C$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$\nC \\left( \\frac{1}{\\delta}\\int_{x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}-\\delta/2}^{x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}+\\delta/2} \\frac{1}{D(x)} \\,\\mathrm{d}x \\right) = S_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$\nThe term in the parentheses is the spatial average of the reciprocal of the diffusion coefficient, which we denote as $\\langle D^{-1} \\rangle$. The diffusion coefficient $D(x) = D_{0}(1 + \\alpha \\cos(k x))$ is periodic with period $P = \\frac{2\\pi}{k}$. The patch width is given as $\\delta = mP$ for an integer $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$. The average of a periodic function over an integer number of periods is independent of the starting point and equals the average over a single period. We can thus compute the integral over the interval $[0, P]$:\n$$\n\\langle D^{-1} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{P} \\int_{0}^{P} \\frac{1}{D(x)} \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{k}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi/k} \\frac{1}{D_{0}(1 + \\alpha \\cos(k x))} \\,\\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we perform a change of variables.

The definition of the CPI step is\n$$\nU^{n+1} = Y(t_{0}) + \\Delta T \\,\\widehat{\\dot{U}}(t_{0})\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of the estimated derivative $\\widehat{\\dot{U}}(t_{0})$ gives\n$$\nU^{n+1} = Y(t_{0}) + \\Delta T \\left(\\frac{Y(t_{0}+\\tau) - Y(t_{0})}{\\tau}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the model for the restricted observable, $Y(t) = U(t) + \\eta(t)$, at times $t_0$ and $t_0+\\tau$:\n$$\nU^{n+1} = (U(t_{0}) + \\eta(t_0)) + \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau} \\left( (U(t_{0}+\\tau) + \\eta(t_0+\\tau)) - (U(t_0) + \\eta(t_0)) \\right)\n$$\nWe can separate the expression for $U^{n+1}$ into a \"signal\" part, which depends only on the true coarse observable $U(t)$, and a \"noise\" part, which depends only on the noise samples $\\eta(t)$. Let the noise component of $U^{n+1}$ be denoted by $N^{n+1}$.\n$$\nU^{n+1} = \\underbrace{\\left[ U(t_0) + \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau} (U(t_0+\\tau) - U(t_0)) \\right]}_{\\text{Signal}} + \\underbrace{\\left[ \\eta(t_0) + \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau} (\\eta(t_0+\\tau) - \\eta(t_0)) \\right]}_{\\text{Noise, } N^{n+1}}\n$$\nThe noise component $N^{n+1}$ is explicitly given by\n$$\nN^{n+1} = \\eta(t_0) + \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau} \\eta(t_0+\\tau) - \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau} \\eta(t_0)\n$$\nCollecting terms for $\\eta(t_0)$ and $\\eta(t_0+\\tau)$, we find the explicit dependence of the noise in $U^{n+1}$ on the two independent noise samples:\n$$\nN^{n+1} = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau}\\right) \\eta(t_0) + \\left(\\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau}\\right) \\eta(t_0+\\tau)\n$$\nThis completes the first part of (a).\n\nNext, we derive the variance of this noise component, $\\operatorname{Var}(N^{n+1})$. The problem states that $\\eta(t_0)$ and $\\eta(t_0+\\tau)$ are independent random variables. For a linear combination of independent random variables $X$ and $Y$ of the form $aX + bY$, the variance is given by $\\operatorname{Var}(aX + bY) = a^2 \\operatorname{Var}(X) + b^2 \\operatorname{Var}(Y)$.\nIn our case, $X = \\eta(t_0)$, $Y = \\eta(t_0+\\tau)$, $a = 1 - \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau}$, and $b = \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau}$. The variances are $\\operatorname{Var}(\\eta(t_0)) = \\sigma^2$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(\\eta(t_0+\\tau)) = \\sigma^2$.\nApplying the variance identity:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(N^{n+1}) = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau}\\right)^2 \\operatorname{Var}(\\eta(t_0)) + \\left(\\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau}\\right)^2 \\operatorname{Var}(\\eta(t_0+\\tau))\n$$\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(N^{n+1}) = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau}\\right)^2 \\sigma^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau}\\right)^2 \\sigma^2\n$$\nFactoring out $\\sigma^2$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(N^{n+1}) = \\left[ \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau}\\right)^2 \\right] \\sigma^2\n$$\nThe variance amplification factor $G(r)$ is defined as the ratio of this variance to $\\sigma^2$. Using the definition $r \\equiv \\Delta T/\\tau$, we get\n$$\nG(r) = \\frac{\\operatorname{Var}(N^{n+1})}{\\sigma^2} = (1 - r)^2 + r^2\n$$\nExpanding the polynomial, we obtain the final expression for $G(r)$:\n$$\nG(r) = 1 - 2r + r^2 + r^2 = 2r^2 - 2r + 1\n$$\nThis completes the second part of (a).\n\nFor the conclusion, we must show that for $r  1$, $G(r)  1$.\nWe set up the inequality:\n$$\nG(r)  1 \\implies 2r^2 - 2r + 1  1\n$$\nSubtracting $1$ from both sides gives\n$$\n2r^2 - 2r  0\n$$\nFactoring out $2r$:\n$$\n2r(r - 1)  0\n$$\nFrom the problem statement, $\\Delta T  0$ and $\\tau  0$, so their ratio $r = \\Delta T / \\tau$ must be positive, $r  0$. Since $2r$ is positive, the inequality holds if and only if the other factor $(r-1)$ is also positive.\n$$\nr - 1  0 \\implies r  1\n$$\nThus, for $r  1$, the variance amplification factor $G(r)$ is greater than $1$, meaning that coarse projective integration amplifies the microscale noise variance.\n\n**(b) Derivation of the Largest Allowable Projective Horizon**\n\nWe are given the tolerance constraint on the variance of the noise in the projected state:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}\\big(\\text{noise in }U^{n+1}\\big) \\leq \\Gamma\\,\\sigma^{2}\n$$\nwhere $\\Gamma \\geq \\frac{1}{2}$. Using the variance amplification factor $G(r)$, this is equivalent to\n$$\nG(r)\\,\\sigma^2 \\leq \\Gamma\\,\\sigma^2\n$$\nSince $\\sigma^2  0$, we can divide by it to get an inequality for $G(r)$:\n$$\nG(r) \\leq \\Gamma\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $G(r)$ from part (a):\n$$\n2r^2 - 2r + 1 \\leq \\Gamma\n$$\nThis is a quadratic inequality for $r$. Rearranging it to the standard form $ar^2+br+c \\leq 0$:\n$$\n2r^2 - 2r + (1 - \\Gamma) \\leq 0\n$$\nThe quadratic function $f(r) = 2r^2 - 2r + (1 - \\Gamma)$ represents a parabola opening upwards. The inequality is satisfied for values of $r$ between the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation $2r^2 - 2r + (1 - \\Gamma) = 0$.\nWe find the roots using the quadratic formula, $r = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$\nr_{\\pm} = \\frac{-(-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4(2)(1-\\Gamma)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 - 8(1-\\Gamma)}}{4}\n$$\n$$\nr_{\\pm} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 - 8 + 8\\Gamma}}{4} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{8\\Gamma - 4}}{4}\n$$\nFactoring out $\\sqrt{4} = 2$ from the square root term:\n$$\nr_{\\pm} = \\frac{2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2\\Gamma - 1}}{4} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{2\\Gamma - 1}}{2}\n$$\nThe roots are real since the problem states $\\Gamma \\geq \\frac{1}{2}$, ensuring that $2\\Gamma - 1 \\geq 0$.\nThe inequality $2r^2 - 2r + (1 - \\Gamma) \\leq 0$ is satisfied for $r$ in the closed interval defined by these two roots:\n$$\n\\frac{1 - \\sqrt{2\\Gamma - 1}}{2} \\leq r \\leq \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{2\\Gamma - 1}}{2}\n$$\nWe are looking for the largest allowable projective horizon, $\\Delta T_{\\max}$. Since $r = \\Delta T / \\tau$ and $\\tau  0$, a larger $r$ corresponds to a larger $\\Delta T$. Therefore, we need the maximum allowed value of $r$, which is the upper bound of the interval:\n$$\nr_{\\max} = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{2\\Gamma - 1}}{2}\n$$\nThe maximum allowed value for $\\Delta T$ is then\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\max} = r_{\\max} \\cdot \\tau\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $r_{\\max}$ gives the final answer:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\max} = \\tau \\left( \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{2\\Gamma - 1}}{2} \\right)\n$$",
            "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\tau \\left( \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{2\\Gamma - 1}}{2} \\right)}$$"
