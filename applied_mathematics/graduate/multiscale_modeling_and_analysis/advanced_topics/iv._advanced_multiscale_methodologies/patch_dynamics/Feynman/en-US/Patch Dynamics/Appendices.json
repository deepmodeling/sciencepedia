You are given a uniform coarse grid with cell centers at $x_{i}$ and spacing $H$, and you are to design a conservative finite volume method (FVM) coarse scheme using patch dynamics: at each coarse interface $x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$, a small symmetric patch of width $\\delta$ is centered at $x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$. The patch width $\\delta$ spans an integer number $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$ of micro-periods of the coefficient $D(x)$, so that $\\delta = m \\,\\frac{2\\pi}{k}$ for some fixed wavenumber $k>0$. Within the patch, the microscale model is the steady-state diffusion equation $\\partial_{x}\\!\\left(D(x)\\,\\partial_{x} u\\right) = 0$, run to steady state subject to the constraint that its mean gradient across the patch matches the coarse gradient, namely $\\frac{1}{\\delta}\\int_{x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}-\\delta/2}^{x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}+\\delta/2} \\partial_{x} u \\,\\mathrm{d}x = S_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$, where $S_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{U_{i+1}-U_{i}}{H}$ and $U_{i}$ is the coarse cell average in cell $i$.

It is well-posed, providing sufficient information to derive the required quantity. The language is objective and formal. The condition $|\\alpha|<1$ ensures that the diffusion coefficient $D(x)$ is strictly positive, which is physically necessary. The problem is a standard, non-trivial exercise in homogenization theory and serves to derive the effective diffusion coefficient for a periodic medium in one dimension. All criteria for a valid problem are met.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe derivation proceeds by solving the local problem on the patch to determine the relationship between the flux and the macroscopic gradient.\n\nWithin the patch centered at an interface $x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$, the governing equation is the steady-state diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\partial_{x}\\!\\left(D(x)\\,\\partial_{x} u\\right) = 0\n$$\nSince this is an ordinary differential equation in the spatial variable $x$, we can integrate it once to obtain:\n$$\nD(x)\\,\\partial_{x} u(x) = C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. The microscale flux is defined by the constitutive relation $q(x) = -D(x)\\,\\partial_{x} u(x)$. From the integrated equation, we see that the flux within the patch is constant: $q(x) = -C$. The problem states that the coarse flux $F_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$ is defined as this constant microscale flux. Therefore:\n$$\nF_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} = -C\n$$\nTo find the constant $C$, we utilize the constraint provided in the problem statement. First, we express the local gradient $\\partial_{x} u(x)$ from the integrated equation:\n$$\n\\partial_{x} u(x) = \\frac{C}{D(x)}\n$$\nThe constraint requires that the average of this local gradient over the patch equals the coarse-scale gradient, $S_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\delta}\\int_{x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}-\\delta/2}^{x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}+\\delta/2} \\partial_{x} u(x) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = S_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\partial_{x} u(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\delta}\\int_{x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}-\\delta/2}^{x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}+\\delta/2} \\frac{C}{D(x)} \\,\\mathrm{d}x = S_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$\nSince $C$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$\nC \\left( \\frac{1}{\\delta}\\int_{x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}-\\delta/2}^{x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}+\\delta/2} \\frac{1}{D(x)} \\,\\mathrm{d}x \\right) = S_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$\nThe term in the parentheses is the spatial average of the reciprocal of the diffusion coefficient, which we denote as $\\langle D^{-1} \\rangle$. The diffusion coefficient $D(x) = D_{0}(1 + \\alpha \\cos(k x))$ is periodic with period $P = \\frac{2\\pi}{k}$. The patch width is given as $\\delta = mP$ for an integer $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$. The average of a periodic function over an integer number of periods is independent of the starting point and equals the average over a single period. We can thus compute the integral over the interval $[0, P]$:\n$$\n\\langle D^{-1} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{P} \\int_{0}^{P} \\frac{1}{D(x)} \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{k}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi/k} \\frac{1}{D_{0}(1 + \\alpha \\cos(k x))} \\,\\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we perform a change of variables. Let $y = kx$, so $\\mathrm{d}y = k\\,\\mathrm{d}x$. The limits of integration for $y$ become $0$ to $2\\pi$:\n$$\n\\langle D^{-1} \\rangle = \\frac{k}{2\\pi D_{0}} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha \\cos(y)} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{k} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi D_{0}} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha \\cos(y)} \\,\\mathrm{d}y\n$$\nThis is a standard definite integral whose value for $|\\alpha|<1$ is $\\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{1-\\alpha^2}}$. Substituting this result:\n$$\n\\langle D^{-1} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2\\pi D_{0}} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{1-\\alpha^2}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{D_{0}\\sqrt{1-\\alpha^2}}\n$$\nThis value represents the reciprocal of the effective diffusivity, a quantity known as the effective resistivity. Now, we substitute this back into the constraint equation:\n$$\nC \\left( \\frac{1}{D_{0}\\sqrt{1-\\alpha^2}} \\right) = S_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$\nSolving for $C$:\n$$\nC = S_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} \\cdot D_{0}\\sqrt{1-\\alpha^2}\n$$\nFinally, we obtain the coarse flux $F_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$ using the relation $F_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} = -C$ and the definition of the coarse gradient $S_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{U_{i+1}-U_i}{H}$:\n$$\nF_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} = - \\left( \\frac{U_{i+1}-U_{i}}{H} \\right) D_{0}\\sqrt{1-\\alpha^2}\n$$\nThis expression can be rearranged into the standard form of a diffusive flux, $F = -D_{eff} \\nabla U$, where $D_{eff} = D_0 \\sqrt{1-\\alpha^2}$ is the effective diffusion coefficient.\n$$\nF_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} = - \\frac{D_{0}\\sqrt{1-\\alpha^2}(U_{i+1}-U_i)}{H}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the conservative coarse flux at the interface.",

The problem provides all necessary definitions and assumptions to derive a unique analytical solution. The questions are mathematically precise.

The problem is stated in precise, formal mathematical language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution is warranted.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n**(a) Noise Propagation and Variance Amplification**\n\nWe begin by expressing the projected coarse state $U^{n+1}$ in terms of the underlying smooth evolution $U(t)$ and the noise $\\eta(t)$. The definition of the CPI step is\n$$\nU^{n+1} = Y(t_{0}) + \\Delta T \\,\\widehat{\\dot{U}}(t_{0})\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of the estimated derivative $\\widehat{\\dot{U}}(t_{0})$ gives\n$$\nU^{n+1} = Y(t_{0}) + \\Delta T \\left(\\frac{Y(t_{0}+\\tau) - Y(t_{0})}{\\tau}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the model for the restricted observable, $Y(t) = U(t) + \\eta(t)$, at times $t_0$ and $t_0+\\tau$:\n$$\nU^{n+1} = (U(t_{0}) + \\eta(t_0)) + \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau} \\left( (U(t_{0}+\\tau) + \\eta(t_0+\\tau)) - (U(t_0) + \\eta(t_0)) \\right)\n$$\nWe can separate the expression for $U^{n+1}$ into a \"signal\" part, which depends only on the true coarse observable $U(t)$, and a \"noise\" part, which depends only on the noise samples $\\eta(t)$. Let the noise component of $U^{n+1}$ be denoted by $N^{n+1}$.\n$$\nU^{n+1} = \\underbrace{\\left[ U(t_0) + \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau} (U(t_0+\\tau) - U(t_0)) \\right]}_{\\text{Signal}} + \\underbrace{\\left[ \\eta(t_0) + \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau} (\\eta(t_0+\\tau) - \\eta(t_0)) \\right]}_{\\text{Noise, } N^{n+1}}\n$$\nThe noise component $N^{n+1}$ is explicitly given by\n$$\nN^{n+1} = \\eta(t_0) + \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau} \\eta(t_0+\\tau) - \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau} \\eta(t_0)\n$$\nCollecting terms for $\\eta(t_0)$ and $\\eta(t_0+\\tau)$, we find the explicit dependence of the noise in $U^{n+1}$ on the two independent noise samples:\n$$\nN^{n+1} = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau}\\right) \\eta(t_0) + \\left(\\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau}\\right) \\eta(t_0+\\tau)\n$$\nThis completes the first part of (a).\n\nNext, we derive the variance of this noise component, $\\operatorname{Var}(N^{n+1})$. The problem states that $\\eta(t_0)$ and $\\eta(t_0+\\tau)$ are independent random variables. For a linear combination of independent random variables $X$ and $Y$ of the form $aX + bY$, the variance is given by $\\operatorname{Var}(aX + bY) = a^2 \\operatorname{Var}(X) + b^2 \\operatorname{Var}(Y)$.\nIn our case, $X = \\eta(t_0)$, $Y = \\eta(t_0+\\tau)$, $a = 1 - \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau}$, and $b = \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau}$. The variances are $\\operatorname{Var}(\\eta(t_0)) = \\sigma^2$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(\\eta(t_0+\\tau)) = \\sigma^2$.\nApplying the variance identity:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(N^{n+1}) = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau}\\right)^2 \\operatorname{Var}(\\eta(t_0)) + \\left(\\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau}\\right)^2 \\operatorname{Var}(\\eta(t_0+\\tau))\n$$\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(N^{n+1}) = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau}\\right)^2 \\sigma^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau}\\right)^2 \\sigma^2\n$$\nFactoring out $\\sigma^2$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(N^{n+1}) = \\left[ \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau}\\right)^2 \\right] \\sigma^2\n$$\nThe variance amplification factor $G(r)$ is defined as the ratio of this variance to $\\sigma^2$. Using the definition $r \\equiv \\Delta T/\\tau$, we get\n$$\nG(r) = \\frac{\\operatorname{Var}(N^{n+1})}{\\sigma^2} = (1 - r)^2 + r^2\n$$\nExpanding the polynomial, we obtain the final expression for $G(r)$:\n$$\nG(r) = 1 - 2r + r^2 + r^2 = 2r^2 - 2r + 1\n$$\nThis completes the second part of (a).\n\nFor the conclusion, we must show that for $r > 1$, $G(r) > 1$.\nWe set up the inequality:\n$$\nG(r) > 1 \\implies 2r^2 - 2r + 1 > 1\n$$\nSubtracting $1$ from both sides gives\n$$\n2r^2 - 2r > 0\n$$\nFactoring out $2r$:\n$$\n2r(r - 1) > 0\n$$\nFrom the problem statement, $\\Delta T > 0$ and $\\tau > 0$, so their ratio $r = \\Delta T / \\tau$ must be positive, $r > 0$. Since $2r$ is positive, the inequality holds if and only if the other factor $(r-1)$ is also positive.\n$$\nr - 1 > 0 \\implies r > 1\n$$\nThus, for $r > 1$, the variance amplification factor $G(r)$ is greater than $1$, meaning that coarse projective integration amplifies the microscale noise variance.\n\n**(b) Derivation of the Largest Allowable Projective Horizon**\n\nWe are given the tolerance constraint on the variance of the noise in the projected state:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}\\big(\\text{noise in }U^{n+1}\\big) \\leq \\Gamma\\,\\sigma^{2}\n$$\nwhere $\\Gamma \\geq \\frac{1}{2}$. Using the variance amplification factor $G(r)$, this is equivalent to\n$$\nG(r)\\,\\sigma^2 \\leq \\Gamma\\,\\sigma^2\n$$\nSince $\\sigma^2 > 0$, we can divide by it to get an inequality for $G(r)$:\n$$\nG(r) \\leq \\Gamma\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $G(r)$ from part (a):\n$$\n2r^2 - 2r + 1 \\leq \\Gamma\n$$\nThis is a quadratic inequality for $r$. Rearranging it to the standard form $ar^2+br+c \\leq 0$:\n$$\n2r^2 - 2r + (1 - \\Gamma) \\leq 0\n$$\nThe quadratic function $f(r) = 2r^2 - 2r + (1 - \\Gamma)$ represents a parabola opening upwards. The inequality is satisfied for values of $r$ between the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation $2r^2 - 2r + (1 - \\Gamma) = 0$.\nWe find the roots using the quadratic formula, $r = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$\nr_{\\pm} = \\frac{-(-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4(2)(1-\\Gamma)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 - 8(1-\\Gamma)}}{4}\n$$\n$$\nr_{\\pm} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 - 8 + 8\\Gamma}}{4} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{8\\Gamma - 4}}{4}\n$$\nFactoring out $\\sqrt{4} = 2$ from the square root term:\n$$\nr_{\\pm} = \\frac{2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2\\Gamma - 1}}{4} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{2\\Gamma - 1}}{2}\n$$\nThe roots are real since the problem states $\\Gamma \\geq \\frac{1}{2}$, ensuring that $2\\Gamma - 1 \\geq 0$.\nThe inequality $2r^2 - 2r + (1 - \\Gamma) \\leq 0$ is satisfied for $r$ in the closed interval defined by these two roots:\n$$\n\\frac{1 - \\sqrt{2\\Gamma - 1}}{2} \\leq r \\leq \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{2\\Gamma - 1}}{2}\n$$\nWe are looking for the largest allowable projective horizon, $\\Delta T_{\\max}$. Since $r = \\Delta T / \\tau$ and $\\tau > 0$, a larger $r$ corresponds to a larger $\\Delta T$. Therefore, we need the maximum allowed value of $r$, which is the upper bound of the interval:\n$$\nr_{\\max} = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{2\\Gamma - 1}}{2}\n$$\nThe maximum allowed value for $\\Delta T$ is then\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\max} = r_{\\max} \\cdot \\tau\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $r_{\\max}$ gives the final answer:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\max} = \\tau \\left( \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{2\\Gamma - 1}}{2} \\right)\n$$",
