            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional particle of mass $m$ interacting linearly with a thermal environment that can be modeled microscopically as a collection of independent harmonic oscillators. The composite system is prepared in canonical equilibrium at absolute temperature $T$, and the particle is coarse-grained as the slow variable of interest while the environment is treated as fast degrees of freedom. The effective dynamics of the particle is represented at the coarse-grained level by a Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) in which the environment induces both a history-dependent friction force and a stationary Gaussian random force. The random force $\\eta(t)$ is assumed to be zero-mean, stationary, and Gaussian with correlation $C_{\\eta}(t)=\\langle\\eta(t)\\eta(0)\\rangle$, and the friction force is represented by a convolution of a causal memory kernel $K(t)$ with the particle velocity $v(t)$.\n\nUsing only: (i) classical Hamiltonian mechanics of the system-plus-bath, (ii) canonical equilibrium statistical mechanics, and (iii) linear response theory with time-translation invariance under equilibrium, derive the equilibrium constraint that relates the memory kernel $K(t)$ to the noise correlation $C_{\\eta}(t)$ so that the coarse-grained dynamics is consistent with detailed balance and equipartition.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the equilibrium constraint relating the memory kernel `K(t)` and the noise correlation `C_η(t)` in a Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE), and then the application of this constraint to a specific form of noise correlation. This constraint is a manifestation of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT).\n\nFirst, we establish the GLE for the particle's velocity `v(t)`. The particle, with mass `m`, is subject to a friction force and a random force from the thermal environment. The GLE is given by:\n$$\nm \\frac{dv(t)}{dt} = -\\int_{-\\infty}^{t} K(t-t') v(t') dt' + \\eta(t)\n$$\nBy causality, the memory kernel `K(t)` must be zero for negative time arguments, i.e., `K(t-t') = 0` for `t' > t`. This allows us to rewrite the friction integral with a change of variables `τ = t-t'`:\n$$\nm \\frac{dv(t)}{dt} = -\\int_{0}^{\\infty} K(\\tau) v(t-\\tau) d\\tau + \\eta(t)\n$$\nThe random force `η(t)` is a stationary Gaussian process with zero mean, `⟨η(t)⟩=0`, and its correlation function is `C_η(t) = ⟨η(t)η(0)⟩`.\n\nTo derive the FDT, we work in the frequency domain. Let `~f(ω)` denote the Fourier transform of a function `f(t)`, defined as `~f(ω) = ∫(-∞ to ∞) f(t) exp(-iωt) dt`. Applying the Fourier transform to the GLE, and using the convolution theorem, we get:\n$$\nm (i\\omega) \\tilde{v}(\\omega) = - \\tilde{K}(\\omega) \\tilde{v}(\\omega) + \\tilde{\\eta}(\\omega)\n$$\nHere, `~K(ω) = ∫(0 to ∞) K(t) exp(-iωt) dt` is the Fourier transform of the causal kernel. We can solve for `~v(ω)`:\n$$\n\\tilde{v}(\\omega) = \\frac{\\tilde{\\eta}(\\omega)}{i\\omega m + \\tilde{K}(\\omega)}\n$$\nThe power spectral density of the velocity, `~C_v(ω)`, is the Fourier transform of the velocity autocorrelation function `C_v(t) = ⟨v(t)v(0)⟩`. Using the Wiener-Khinchin theorem and the expression for `~v(ω)`, we relate the velocity spectrum to the noise spectrum `~C_η(ω)`:\n$$\n\\tilde{C}_v(\\omega) \\propto \\langle |\\tilde{v}(\\omega)|^2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle |\\tilde{\\eta}(\\omega)|^2 \\rangle}{|i\\omega m + \\tilde{K}(\\omega)|^2} \\propto \\frac{\\tilde{C}_{\\eta}(\\omega)}{|i\\omega m + \\tilde{K}(\\omega)|^2}\n$$\nNext, we invoke linear response theory, which provides an independent expression for `~C_v(ω)` in thermal equilibrium. The mechanical admittance, `χ(ω)`, is the response of the velocity to a hypothetical external force `~F_ext(ω)`. From the GLE, this is `χ(ω) = 1 / (iωm + ~K(ω))`. The FDT relates the equilibrium fluctuations to the dissipative part of the response function:\n$$\n\\tilde{C}_v(\\omega) = 2 k_B T \\text{Re}[\\chi(\\omega)]\n$$\nwhere `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant and `T` is the absolute temperature. Let's compute `Re[χ(ω)]`:\n$$\n\\text{Re}[\\chi(\\omega)] = \\text{Re}\\left[ \\frac{1}{i\\omega m + \\tilde{K}(\\omega)} \\right] = \\frac{\\text{Re}[\\tilde{K}(\\omega)]}{|i\\omega m + \\tilde{K}(\\omega)|^2}\n$$\nNow we equate the two expressions for `~C_v(ω)`:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tilde{C}_{\\eta}(\\omega)}{|i\\omega m + \\tilde{K}(\\omega)|^2} = 2 k_B T \\frac{\\text{Re}[\\tilde{K}(\\omega)]}{|i\\omega m + \\tilde{K}(\\omega)|^2}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the FDT in the frequency domain:\n$$\n\\tilde{C}_{\\eta}(\\omega) = 2 k_B T \\text{Re}[\\tilde{K}(\\omega)]\n$$\nTo transform this back to the time domain, we note that for a causal, real kernel `K(t)`, `Re[~K(ω)] = (1/2)(~K(ω) + ~K*(ω))`. The inverse Fourier transform of `~K*(ω)` is `K(-t)`. Therefore, taking the inverse Fourier transform of the FDT gives:\n$$\nC_{\\eta}(t) = k_B T (K(t) + K(-t))\n$$\nSince `K(t)` is causal (`K(t)=0` for `t0`) and `C_η(t)` is an even function of time (`C_η(t)=C_η(-t)`), for `t>0` we have `K(-t)=0`, which simplifies the relation to:\n$$\nC_{\\eta}(t) = k_B T K(t) \\quad \\text{for} \\quad t>0\n$$\nFrom this, we can express the kernel `K(t)` directly in terms of the noise correlation for non-negative times:\n$$\nK(t) = \\frac{1}{k_B T} C_{\\eta}(t) \\quad \\text{for} \\quad t \\geq 0\n$$\nand `K(t)=0` for `t0`.\n\nNow, we apply this result to the specific noise correlation function provided:\n$$\nC_{\\eta}(t) = C_{0}\\,\\exp(-\\alpha|t|)\\,\\cos(\\omega t)\n$$\nwith `C_0>0`, `α>0`, and `ω≥0`. For `t ≥ 0`, `|t|=t`, so the correlation function becomes:\n$$\nC_{\\eta}(t) = C_{0}\\,\\exp(-\\alpha t)\\,\\cos(\\omega t) \\quad \\text{for} \\quad t \\geq 0\n$$\nSubstituting this into our derived expression for the kernel gives:\n$$\nK(t) = \\frac{C_{0}}{k_B T} \\exp(-\\alpha t)\\,\\cos(\\omega t) \\quad \\text{for} \\quad t \\geq 0\n$$\nTo represent the causal nature of the kernel for all time `t`, we use the Heaviside step function `Θ(t)`. The final expression for the friction kernel is:\n$$\nK(t) = \\frac{C_{0}}{k_B T} \\exp(-\\alpha t)\\,\\cos(\\omega t) \\Theta(t)\n$$\nThe units of this expression are consistent. The noise correlation `C_η(t) = ⟨η(t)η(0)⟩` has units of force squared, i.e., `N^2`. The term `k_B T` has units of energy, i.e., `N⋅m`. Therefore, the prefactor `C_0/(k_B T)` has units of `N^2/(N⋅m) = N/m`, as requested.",
