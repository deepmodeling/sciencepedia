            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation and is found to be valid. It is a well-posed problem in geometric mechanics, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for a solution.\n\nThe problem asks for three main tasks: first, to derive the Lie–Poisson bracket on the dual of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$, identified with $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$; second, to use this bracket to show that the function $C(\\mathbf{M}) = \\|\\mathbf{M}\\|^{2}$ is a Casimir invariant; and third, to explain the role of this Casimir in the energy–Casimir method for stability analysis of a free rigid body.\n\nThe Lie–Poisson bracket for two smooth functions $F, G$ on the dual $\\mathfrak{g}^{*}$ of a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined, for $\\mu \\in \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$, as\n$$\n\\{F,G\\}(\\mu) = -\\langle \\mu, [\\mathrm{d}F(\\mu), \\mathrm{d}G(\\mu)] \\rangle\n$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{d}F(\\mu)$ and $\\mathrm{d}G(\\mu)$ are the differentials of $F$ and $G$ at $\\mu$, which are elements of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, and $[\\cdot,\\cdot]$ is the Lie bracket on $\\mathfrak{g}$. The pairing $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ is the natural pairing between $\\mathfrak{g}^{*}$ and $\\mathfrak{g}$. The negative sign is a common convention in mechanics, which yields the correct Hamilton's equations for physical systems like the rigid body.\n\nIn this problem, the Lie algebra is $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{so}(3)$, the space of $3 \\times 3$ real, skew-symmetric matrices. Its dual is $\\mathfrak{g}^* = \\mathfrak{so}(3)^*$. The problem states that we identify both $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$ and $\\mathfrak{so}(3)^*$ with $\\mathbb{R}^3$. A point in $\\mathfrak{so}(3)^*$ is identified with the angular momentum vector $\\mathbf{M} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. The functions $F$ and $G$ are maps from $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe identification between $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$ is given by the hat map, $\\mathbf{a} \\mapsto \\widehat{\\mathbf{a}}$, where for $\\mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2, a_3) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$,\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathbf{a}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -a_3 & a_2 \\\\ a_3 & 0 & -a_1 \\\\ -a_2 & a_1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe Lie bracket on $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$ is the matrix commutator, and the problem provides the crucial isomorphism property: $[\\widehat{\\mathbf{a}}, \\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}] = \\widehat{\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}}$ for any $\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nThe differentials $\\mathrm{d}F$ and $\\mathrm{d}G$ at a point $\\mathbf{M}$ are elements of $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$. We need to relate them to the standard gradients $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{M})$ and $\\nabla G(\\mathbf{M})$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The identification is made via the Euclidean inner product on $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The gradient $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{M})$ is the vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ such that for any variation $\\delta\\mathbf{M}$, the change in $F$ is $\\delta F = \\nabla F(\\mathbf{M}) \\cdot \\delta\\mathbf{M}$ to first order. Under the hat map isomorphism, the differential $\\mathrm{d}F(\\mathbf{M}) \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$ is identified with $\\widehat{\\nabla F(\\mathbf{M})}$. Similarly, $\\mathrm{d}G(\\mathbf{M})$ is identified with $\\widehat{\\nabla G(\\mathbf{M})}$.\n\nThe pairing $\\langle \\mu, \\xi \\rangle$ between $\\mu \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)^*$ and $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$ is also defined via the identification with $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and its dot product. If we identify $\\mu$ with the vector $\\mathbf{M} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ and $\\xi$ with $\\widehat{\\mathbf{v}} \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$ for some $\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, the pairing is given by $\\langle \\mathbf{M}, \\widehat{\\mathbf{v}} \\rangle = \\mathbf{M} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$.\n\nSubstituting these identifications into the general definition of the Lie-Poisson bracket:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item The point in the dual space is $\\mu \\to \\mathbf{M}$.\n    \\item The differentials are $\\mathrm{d}F(\\mu) \\to \\widehat{\\nabla F(\\mathbf{M})}$ and $\\mathrm{d}G(\\mu) \\to \\widehat{\\nabla G(\\mathbf{M})}$.\n    \\item The Lie bracket of the differentials is $[\\widehat{\\nabla F(\\mathbf{M})}, \\widehat{\\nabla G(\\mathbf{M})}] = \\widehat{\\nabla F(\\mathbf{M}) \\times \\nabla G(\\mathbf{M})}$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nSo, the Lie–Poisson bracket becomes:\n$$\n\\{F,G\\}(\\mathbf{M}) = -\\langle \\mathbf{M}, \\widehat{\\nabla F(\\mathbf{M}) \\times \\nabla G(\\mathbf{M})} \\rangle\n$$\nUsing the pairing rule $\\langle \\mathbf{M}, \\widehat{\\mathbf{v}} \\rangle = \\mathbf{M} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$ with $\\mathbf{v} = \\nabla F(\\mathbf{M}) \\times \\nabla G(\\mathbf{M})$, we obtain the expression for the Lie–Poisson bracket on $\\mathfrak{so}(3)^* \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3$:\n$$\n\\{F,G\\}(\\mathbf{M}) = - \\mathbf{M} \\cdot (\\nabla F(\\mathbf{M}) \\times \\nabla G(\\mathbf{M}))\n$$\nThis is the desired expression in terms of $\\mathbf{M}$ and the gradients of the functions.\n\nNext, we evaluate $\\{C,F\\}(\\mathbf{M})$ for $C(\\mathbf{M}) = \\|\\mathbf{M}\\|^2 = M_1^2 + M_2^2 + M_3^2$ and an arbitrary smooth function $F(\\mathbf{M})$. First, we compute the gradient of $C$:\n$$\n\\nabla C(\\mathbf{M}) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial M_1}, \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial M_2}, \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial M_3}\\right) = (2M_1, 2M_2, 2M_3) = 2\\mathbf{M}\n$$\nNow, we substitute $\\nabla C$ into the bracket expression:\n$$\n\\{C,F\\}(\\mathbf{M}) = - \\mathbf{M} \\cdot (\\nabla C(\\mathbf{M}) \\times \\nabla F(\\mathbf{M})) = - \\mathbf{M} \\cdot (2\\mathbf{M} \\times \\nabla F(\\mathbf{M}))\n$$\nThis expression is a scalar triple product. A fundamental property of the vector cross product is that for any vector $\\mathbf{v}$, the vector $\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{w}$ is orthogonal to $\\mathbf{v}$. Therefore, their dot product is zero: $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{w}) = 0$. In our case, with $\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{M}$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M} \\cdot (\\mathbf{M} \\times \\nabla F(\\mathbf{M})) = 0\n$$\nThus, the Poisson bracket is:\n$$\n\\{C,F\\}(\\mathbf{M}) = -2 \\times 0 = 0\n$$\nSince $\\{C,F\\}(\\mathbf{M})=0$ for any smooth function $F$, $C(\\mathbf{M}) = \\|\\mathbf{M}\\|^2$ is a Casimir function for this Lie–Poisson structure.\n\nFinally, we explain the role of this Casimir in the energy–Casimir method for analyzing the stability of a free rigid body. The dynamics of a free rigid body, after reduction due to $SO(3)$ symmetry, are described by Euler's equations on $\\mathbb{R}^3$, which represents the body's angular momentum, $\\mathbf{M}$. These equations are Hamiltonian with respect to the Lie-Poisson bracket derived above, with the Hamiltonian being the kinetic energy $H(\\mathbf{M}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{M} \\cdot \\mathbf{I}^{-1}\\mathbf{M}$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the inertia tensor. The equations of motion are $\\dot{\\mathbf{M}} = \\{\\mathbf{M},H\\} = \\mathbf{M} \\times (\\mathbf{I}^{-1}\\mathbf{M})$.\n\nEquilibrium points $\\mathbf{M}_e$ of this system are steady rotations, where $\\dot{\\mathbf{M}} = \\mathbf{0}$. This occurs when $\\mathbf{M}_e$ is aligned with a principal axis of the inertia tensor. To assess the Lyapunov stability of such an equilibrium, one seeks a Lyapunov function $V(\\mathbf{M})$ which is conserved, has a strict local extremum (minimum or maximum) at $\\mathbf{M}_e$, and is constant on system trajectories.\n\nThe Hamiltonian $H$ is conserved, but it does not always have a local extremum at an equilibrium (e.g., for rotation about the intermediate axis, $H$ has a saddle). This is where the Casimir invariant $C(\\mathbf{M})$ becomes crucial. Since $\\{C,F\\}=0$ for any $F$, $C$ is conserved along any trajectory. This means the dynamics are confined to the level sets of $C$, which are spheres $\\|\\mathbf{M}\\|^2 = \\text{constant}$. These spheres are the coadjoint orbits of the $SO(3)$ action.\n\nThe energy-Casimir method consists of constructing a new conserved quantity by combining the energy and the Casimir. For any smooth function $\\Phi \\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, the function $H_\\Phi(\\mathbf{M}) = H(\\mathbf{M}) + \\Phi(C(\\mathbf{M}))$ is also conserved, because its time evolution is given by the Poisson bracket with $H$:\n$$\n\\dot{H}_\\Phi = \\{H_\\Phi, H\\} = \\{H,H\\} + \\{\\Phi(C), H\\} = 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\nThe second term is zero because $C$ is a Casimir. The goal is to choose the function $\\Phi$ such that $H_\\Phi$ has a strict local extremum at the equilibrium point $\\mathbf{M}_e$. This requires two conditions:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item The first variation of $H_\\Phi$ must vanish at $\\mathbf{M}_e$: $\\nabla H_\\Phi(\\mathbf{M}_e) = \\mathbf{0}$. This implies $\\nabla H(\\mathbf{M}_e) + \\Phi'(C(\\mathbf{M}_e))\\nabla C(\\mathbf{M}_e) = \\mathbf{0}$. This condition can be satisfied for any equilibrium point $\\mathbf{M}_e$ by appropriately choosing the constant value $\\lambda = \\Phi'(C(\\mathbf{M}_e))$.\n    \\item The second variation (Hessian matrix) of $H_\\Phi$ at $\\mathbf{M}_e$, $D^2 H_\\Phi(\\mathbf{M}_e)$, must be definite (either positive or negative) when restricted to the tangent space of the coadjoint orbit (the sphere $C(\\mathbf{M}) = C(\\mathbf{M}_e)$) at $\\mathbf{M}_e$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nIf such a $\\Phi$ can be found, then $H_\\Phi$ serves as a local Lyapunov function, and the equilibrium point $\\mathbf{M}_e$ is proven to be Lyapunov stable. This method therefore leverages the existence of a Casimir invariant to construct a tailored conserved quantity that can certify stability.",

This is the condition $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{M}) = 0$. The gradient of $F(\\mathbf{M})$ is the vector of partial derivatives with respect to $M_k$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial M_{k}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{I_{k}} + \\lambda\\right) M_{k}\n$$\nThus, $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{M}) = \\left( \\left(\\frac{1}{I_{1}} + \\lambda\\right) M_{1}, \\left(\\frac{1}{I_{2}} + \\lambda\\right) M_{2}, \\left(\\frac{1}{I_{3}} + \\lambda\\right) M_{3} \\right)$. We evaluate this at an equilibrium point $\\mathbf{M}_{e} = M_{0} e_{i}$, where $e_{i}$ is the $i$-th standard basis vector. This means $M_{j} = M_{0}\\delta_{ji}$. The equilibrium condition $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{M}_{e}) = 0$ requires the $i$-th component of the gradient to be zero, as all other components are trivially zero:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{I_{i}} + \\lambda\\right)M_{0} = 0\n$$\nGiven that $M_{0} \\neq 0$, we find the value of the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = -\\frac{1}{I_{i}}\n$$\nNext, we compute the second variation, $\\delta^{2}F$, which is the quadratic form associated with the Hessian matrix $D^{2}F$. The entries of the Hessian are $(D^{2}F)_{jk} = \\frac{\\partial^{2}F}{\\partial M_{j} \\partial M_{k}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2}F}{\\partial M_{j} \\partial M_{k}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial M_{j}}\\left[\\left(\\frac{1}{I_{k}} + \\lambda\\right) M_{k}\\right] = \\left(\\frac{1}{I_{k}} + \\lambda\\right)\\delta_{jk}\n$$\nThe Hessian is a diagonal matrix. At the equilibrium $\\mathbf{M}_{e}$, we substitute $\\lambda = -1/I_{i}$, yielding:\n$$\nD^{2}F(\\mathbf{M}_{e}) = \\text{diag}\\left(\\frac{1}{I_{1}} - \\frac{1}{I_{i}}, \\frac{1}{I_{2}} - \\frac{1}{I_{i}}, \\frac{1}{I_{3}} - \\frac{1}{I_{i}}\\right)\n$$\nThe second variation for an arbitrary perturbation $\\delta \\mathbf{M}$ is $\\delta^{2} F(\\delta \\mathbf{M}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{I_{j}} - \\frac{1}{I_{i}}\\right)(\\delta M_{j})^{2}$.\nWe must restrict this quadratic form to the tangent plane of the coadjoint orbit at $\\mathbf{M}_{e}$, denoted $T_{\\mathbf{M}_{e}}\\mathcal{O}_{|\\mathbf{M}_{e}|}$. The orbit $\\mathcal{O}_{|\\mathbf{M}_{e}|}$ is a sphere defined by $|\\mathbf{M}|^{2} = |\\mathbf{M}_{e}|^{2} = M_{0}^{2}$. The tangent plane is the set of vectors $\\delta \\mathbf{M}$ orthogonal to the normal vector of the sphere at $\\mathbf{M}_e$, which is parallel to $\\mathbf{M}_e$. The condition is $\\delta \\mathbf{M} \\cdot \\mathbf{M}_{e} = 0$. For $\\mathbf{M}_{e} = M_{0}e_{i}$, this implies $M_{0}(\\delta \\mathbf{M} \\cdot e_{i}) = M_{0}\\delta M_{i} = 0$. As $M_{0} \\neq 0$, we have the constraint $\\delta M_{i} = 0$.\nApplying this constraint to $\\delta^{2}F$, the $i$-th term in the sum vanishes, giving the restricted second variation:\n$$\n\\delta^{2}F|_{T_{\\mathbf{M}_{e}}\\mathcal{O}} (\\delta \\mathbf{M}) = \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\left(\\frac{1}{I_{j}} - \\frac{1}{I_{i}}\\right) (\\delta M_{j})^{2}\n$$\n\n**2) Specialization to Minimum- and Maximum-Inertia Axes**\n\nWe now apply this general formula to the specified cases.\n\nCase $i=1$ (minimum-inertia axis): The equilibrium is $\\mathbf{M}_e = M_{0}e_{1}$. The perturbations must satisfy $\\delta M_{1} = 0$. An orthonormal basis for the tangent plane is $\\{e_{2}, e_{3}\\}$. The restricted second variation is:\n$$\n\\delta^{2}F|_{i=1} = \\left(\\frac{1}{I_{2}} - \\frac{1}{I_{1}}\\right)(\\delta M_{2})^{2} + \\left(\\frac{1}{I_{3}} - \\frac{1}{I_{1}}\\right)(\\delta M_{3})^{2}\n$$\nThis expression is in diagonal form with respect to the basis $\\{e_2, e_3\\}$. The diagonal coefficients are the terms in parentheses.\n\nCase $i=3$ (maximum-inertia axis): The equilibrium is $\\mathbf{M}_e = M_{0}e_{3}$. The perturbations must satisfy $\\delta M_{3} = 0$. An orthonormal basis for the tangent plane is $\\{e_{1}, e_{2}\\}$. The restricted second variation is:\n$$\n\\delta^{2}F|_{i=3} = \\left(\\frac{1}{I_{1}} - \\frac{1}{I_{3}}\\right)(\\delta M_{1})^{2} + \\left(\\frac{1}{I_{2}} - \\frac{1}{I_{3}}\\right)(\\delta M_{2})^{2}\n$$\nThis is in diagonal form with respect to the basis $\\{e_1, e_2\\}$, with diagonal coefficients given by the terms in parentheses.\n\n**3) Stability Conclusion**\n\nThe stability of each equilibrium is determined by the definiteness of the respective quadratic form, which depends on the signs of the coefficients. We use the given relation $0 < I_{1} < I_{2} < I_{3}$, which implies for the inverse moments: $\\frac{1}{I_{1}} > \\frac{1}{I_{2}} > \\frac{1}{I_{3}} > 0$.\n\nFor the $i=1$ case:\n- The coefficient $(\\frac{1}{I_{2}} - \\frac{1}{I_{1}})$ is negative because $I_1 < I_2 \\implies \\frac{1}{I_1} > \\frac{1}{I_2}$.\n- The coefficient $(\\frac{1}{I_{3}} - \\frac{1}{I_{1}})$ is negative because $I_1 < I_3 \\implies \\frac{1}{I_1} > \\frac{1}{I_3}$.\nSince both coefficients are negative, $\\delta^{2}F$ is negative definite. This implies that $\\mathbf{M}_{e}=M_0e_1$ is a strict local maximum of $F$ when restricted to the coadjoint orbit. By the energy-Casimir method, this implies the equilibrium is stable.\n\nFor the $i=3$ case:\n- The coefficient $(\\frac{1}{I_{1}} - \\frac{1}{I_{3}})$ is positive because $I_1 < I_3 \\implies \\frac{1}{I_1} > \\frac{1}{I_3}$.\n- The coefficient $(\\frac{1}{I_{2}} - \\frac{1}{I_{3}})$ is positive because $I_2 < I_3 \\implies \\frac{1}{I_2} > \\frac{1}{I_3}$.\nSince both coefficients are positive, $\\delta^{2}F$ is positive definite. This implies that $\\mathbf{M}_{e}=M_0e_3$ is a strict local minimum of $F$ on the coadjoint orbit, which also implies the equilibrium is stable.\n\nThe final answer requires the four diagonal coefficients, written in a clear fractional form:\n- Case $i=1$, coefficient along $e_{2}$: $\\frac{1}{I_{2}} - \\frac{1}{I_{1}} = \\frac{I_{1} - I_{2}}{I_{1}I_{2}}$.\n- Case $i=1$, coefficient along $e_{3}$: $\\frac{1}{I_{3}} - \\frac{1}{I_{1}} = \\frac{I_{1} - I_{3}}{I_{1}I_{3}}$.\n- Case $i=3$, coefficient along $e_{1}$: $\\frac{1}{I_{1}} - \\frac{1}{I_{3}} = \\frac{I_{3} - I_{1}}{I_{1}I_{3}}$.\n- Case $i=3$, coefficient along $e_{2}$: $\\frac{1}{I_{2}} - \\frac{1}{I_{3}} = \\frac{I_{3} - I_{2}}{I_{2}I_{3}}$.\nThese are arranged in a row matrix as requested.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the equilibrium condition for the 2D Euler equations by two related variational methods, and the final expression of the functional relationship between vorticity and streamfunction for these equilibria.\n\nWe are given the following definitions on a bounded, simply connected domain $\\mathcal{D} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2}$:\nThe kinetic energy functional is $H[\\omega] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\mathcal{D}} |\\nabla \\psi|^{2} \\, \\mathrm{d}A$.\nThe quadratic Casimir (enstrophy) is $C[\\omega] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\mathcal{D}} \\omega^{2} \\, \\mathrm{d}A$.\nThe streamfunction $\\psi$ and vorticity $\\omega$ are related by the Poisson equation $\\Delta \\psi = -\\omega$ in $\\mathcal{D}$, with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition $\\psi|_{\\partial \\mathcal{D}} = 0$.\n\nFirst, it is advantageous to express the kinetic energy $H[\\omega]$ directly in terms of $\\psi$ and $\\omega$ in a single integral. Using Green's first identity, $\\int_{\\mathcal{D}} (f \\Delta g + \\nabla f \\cdot \\nabla g) \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\oint_{\\partial \\mathcal{D}} f (\\nabla g \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\, \\mathrm{d}S$, with $f=g=\\psi$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathcal{D}} (\\psi \\Delta \\psi + |\\nabla \\psi|^{2}) \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\oint_{\\partial \\mathcal{D}} \\psi (\\nabla \\psi \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\, \\mathrm{d}S\n$$\nSince $\\psi|_{\\partial \\mathcal{D}} = 0$, the boundary integral vanishes. Rearranging the equation, we get:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathcal{D}} |\\nabla \\psi|^{2} \\, \\mathrm{d}A = - \\int_{\\mathcal{D}} \\psi \\Delta \\psi \\, \\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of $H[\\omega]$:\n$$\nH[\\omega] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\mathcal{D}} |\\nabla \\psi|^{2} \\, \\mathrm{d}A = -\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\mathcal{D}} \\psi \\Delta \\psi \\, \\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nUsing the relation $\\Delta \\psi = -\\omega$, we obtain a more convenient form for the energy functional:\n$$\nH[\\omega] = -\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\mathcal{D}} \\psi (-\\omega) \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\mathcal{D}} \\psi \\omega \\, \\mathrm{d}A\n$$\n\n**1) Constrained Variational Problem using a Lagrange Multiplier**\n\nWe seek to find the extrema of $H[\\omega]$ subject to the constraint $C[\\omega] = c_{0}$, where $c_{0} > 0$ is a constant. We introduce a Lagrange multiplier $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and form the augmented functional:\n$$\n\\mathcal{J}[\\omega] = H[\\omega] + \\alpha \\left(C[\\omega] - c_{0}\\right)\n$$\nA necessary condition for an extremum is that the first variation of $\\mathcal{J}$ with respect to $\\omega$ is zero, i.e., $\\delta \\mathcal{J}[\\omega] = 0$.\n$$\n\\delta \\mathcal{J}[\\omega] = \\delta H[\\omega] + \\alpha \\delta C[\\omega] = 0\n$$\nWe compute the variations $\\delta H$ and $\\delta C$. A variation $\\delta \\omega$ in the vorticity induces a variation $\\delta \\psi$ in the streamfunction, governed by $\\Delta(\\delta \\psi) = -\\delta \\omega$ with $\\delta \\psi|_{\\partial \\mathcal{D}} = 0$.\n\nThe variation of the energy is:\n$$\n\\delta H[\\omega] = \\delta \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\mathcal{D}} \\psi \\omega \\, \\mathrm{d}A \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\mathcal{D}} (\\delta\\psi \\cdot \\omega + \\psi \\cdot \\delta\\omega) \\, \\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nWe rewrite the first term using the relation $\\omega = -\\Delta\\psi$ and Green's second identity. For any two functions $u, v$ that are zero on $\\partial\\mathcal{D}$, we have $\\int_{\\mathcal{D}} u \\Delta v \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{\\mathcal{D}} v \\Delta u \\, \\mathrm{d}A$. Let $u=\\delta\\psi$ and $v=\\psi$.\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathcal{D}} \\delta\\psi \\cdot \\omega \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{\\mathcal{D}} \\delta\\psi (-\\Delta\\psi) \\, \\mathrm{d}A = -\\int_{\\mathcal{D}} \\psi \\Delta(\\delta\\psi) \\, \\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nUsing $\\Delta(\\delta\\psi) = -\\delta\\omega$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathcal{D}} \\delta\\psi \\cdot \\omega \\, \\mathrm{d}A = -\\int_{\\mathcal{D}} \\psi (-\\delta\\omega) \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{\\mathcal{D}} \\psi \\delta\\omega \\, \\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\delta H$:\n$$\n\\delta H[\\omega] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\mathcal{D}} (\\psi \\delta\\omega + \\psi \\delta\\omega) \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{\\mathcal{D}} \\psi \\delta\\omega \\, \\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nThe variation of the Casimir is straightforward:\n$$\n\\delta C[\\omega] = \\delta \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\mathcal{D}} \\omega^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}A \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\mathcal{D}} 2\\omega \\delta\\omega \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{\\mathcal{D}} \\omega \\delta\\omega \\, \\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nCombining the variations, the condition $\\delta \\mathcal{J}[\\omega]=0$ becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathcal{D}} \\psi \\delta\\omega \\, \\mathrm{d}A + \\alpha \\int_{\\mathcal{D}} \\omega \\delta\\omega \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{\\mathcal{D}} (\\psi + \\alpha \\omega) \\delta\\omega \\, \\mathrm{d}A = 0\n$$\nSince this equation must hold for all admissible variations $\\delta\\omega$, the fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations implies that the integrand must be zero pointwise in $\\mathcal{D}$. This gives the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n$$\n\\psi + \\alpha \\omega = 0\n$$\n\n**2) Equilibrium Condition from the Energy–Casimir Method**\n\nThe energy-Casimir method seeks equilibria of the system as critical points of the functional $F[\\omega] = H[\\omega] + \\alpha C[\\omega]$. Here, $\\alpha$ is a parameter defining a family of conserved quantities. The condition for an equilibrium is that the first variation of $F$ vanishes, $\\delta F[\\omega] = 0$.\n$$\n\\delta F[\\omega] = \\delta H[\\omega] + \\alpha \\delta C[\\omega]\n$$\nThis is precisely the same variational expression as $\\delta \\mathcal{J}[\\omega]$ derived in the first part. Using the results from part $1$:\n$$\n\\delta F[\\omega] = \\int_{\\mathcal{D}} \\psi \\delta\\omega \\, \\mathrm{d}A + \\alpha \\int_{\\mathcal{D}} \\omega \\delta\\omega \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{\\mathcal{D}} (\\psi + \\alpha \\omega) \\delta\\omega \\, \\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nSetting $\\delta F[\\omega] = 0$ for arbitrary $\\delta\\omega$ again requires the integrand to be zero:\n$$\n\\psi + \\alpha \\omega = 0\n$$\nThis demonstrates that both methods yield the identical pointwise condition for this class of constrained equilibria.\n\n**Final Functional Relation**\n\nThe condition characterizing the equilibria is $\\psi + \\alpha \\omega = 0$. To provide the explicit functional relation $\\omega(\\psi)$, we solve this algebraic equation for $\\omega$. Assuming $\\alpha \\neq 0$ (a trivial case corresponding to no constraint), we find:\n$$\n\\omega(\\psi) = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\psi\n$$\nThis linear relationship between the vorticity and the streamfunction characterizes the stationary solutions of the 2D Euler equations that are extrema of energy for a fixed enstrophy. The parameter $\\alpha$ is determined by the specific value of the enstrophy constraint $c_{0}$.",
