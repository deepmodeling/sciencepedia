This first practice focuses on deriving the Hamilton-Jacobi characteristic function $W(q)$ for a free particle at a fixed energy, a fundamental example that illustrates how the dynamics on an energy hypersurface can be encoded in a single scalar function. By confirming that the momentum derived from this function, $p = \\partial_q W$, correctly reproduces the expected uniform linear motion, you will build a concrete understanding of the theory's power.

The phase space is the cotangent bundle $T^*\\mathbb{R}$ equipped with the canonical symplectic form. The system has Hamiltonian $H(q,p)=\\frac{p^2}{2m}$ for a constant mass $m0$. A Lagrangian submanifold of $T^*\\mathbb{R}$ can be specified as the graph of the exact one-form $\\mathrm{d}W$, where $W(q)$ is a generating function, and the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) characteristic function corresponds to the choice of $W$ whose image under $\\mathrm{d}W$ lies in the fixed energy hypersurface $H=E$ for a given constant energy $E0$. Using only the geometric definition of a generating function as above and the fundamental laws of Hamiltonian dynamics, determine the analytic expression for the HJ characteristic function $W(q)$ subject to the boundary condition $W(0)=0$ and the branch choice associated with motion in the positive $q$-direction.

It describes a free particle within the Hamiltonian framework and asks for the derivation of the Hamilton-Jacobi characteristic function. All concepts used (Hamiltonian, phase space, generating function, Lagrangian submanifold) are fundamental and well-defined. The problem is scientifically sound, objective, and self-contained, with sufficient information provided to determine a unique solution. The conditions given are consistent and physically realistic for an idealized system. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution will now be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Hamilton-Jacobi Characteristic Function $W(q)$**\n\nThe problem states that the Lagrangian submanifold is the graph of the exact one-form $\\mathrm{d}W$. In the coordinate system $(q,p)$ on the phase space $T^*\\mathbb{R}$, this means that the momentum $p$ is given by the derivative of the generating function $W(q)$ with respect to the position coordinate $q$.\n$$p = \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial q}(q)$$\nIt is also given that this submanifold is contained within the hypersurface of constant energy $E$. This imposes the condition that the Hamiltonian, when evaluated on the submanifold, must equal $E$.\n$$H(q, p(q)) = E$$\nThe Hamiltonian for the free particle is given as $H(q,p) = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$. Substituting the expression for $p$ in terms of $W(q)$ into the Hamiltonian, we obtain the time-independent Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the characteristic function $W(q)$.\n$$H\\left(q, \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial q}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2m} \\left( \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial q} \\right)^{2} = E$$\nWe can now solve this first-order ordinary differential equation for $W(q)$. Rearranging the equation gives:\n$$\\left( \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial q} \\right)^{2} = 2mE$$\nTaking the square root of both sides yields:\n$$\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial q} = \\pm \\sqrt{2mE}$$\nThe problem specifies that we should choose the branch associated with motion in the positive $q$-direction. In Hamiltonian mechanics, the velocity $\\dot{q}$ is related to the momentum $p$ by Hamilton's equation $\\dot{q} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} = \\frac{p}{m}$. Thus, positive velocity $\\dot{q}0$ corresponds to positive momentum $p0$. Since $p = \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial q}$, we must choose the positive root.\n$$\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial q} = \\sqrt{2mE}$$\nTo find $W(q)$, we integrate the above expression with respect to $q$. Since $m$ and $E$ are constants, the term $\\sqrt{2mE}$ is also a constant.\n$$W(q) = \\int \\sqrt{2mE} \\, \\mathrm{d}q = (\\sqrt{2mE})q + C$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. We determine the value of $C$ using the provided boundary condition $W(0)=0$.\n$$W(0) = (\\sqrt{2mE})(0) + C = 0 \\implies C = 0$$\nThus, the Hamilton-Jacobi characteristic function is:\n$$W(q) = \\sqrt{2mE} q$$\n\n**Verification of Uniform Linear Motion**\n\nNext, we must verify that this solution generates uniform linear motion. We use Hamilton's equations of motion:\n$$\\dot{q} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\dot{p} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q}$$\nFor the Hamiltonian $H(q,p) = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$, the partial derivatives are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} \\left( \\frac{p^2}{2m} \\right) = \\frac{2p}{2m} = \\frac{p}{m}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q} \\left( \\frac{p^2}{2m} \\right) = 0$$\nSubstituting these into Hamilton's equations gives:\n$$1. \\quad \\dot{q} = \\frac{p}{m}$$\n$$2. \\quad \\dot{p} = 0$$\nThe second equation, $\\dot{p}=0$, shows that the canonical momentum $p$ is a constant of motion. The momentum induced by our generating function is $p = \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial q} = \\sqrt{2mE}$. Since $m$ and $E$ are constants, this value of $p$ is indeed constant, consistent with Hamilton's second equation.\n\nNow we use the first equation to find the motion in the coordinate $q$. Substituting the constant value of $p$ into the equation for $\\dot{q}$:\n$$\\dot{q} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2mE}}{m} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2mE}{m^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{m}}$$\nThis shows that the velocity $\\dot{q}$ is a constant. Let this constant velocity be $v_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{m}}$. To find the position $q$ as a function of time $t$, we integrate the velocity:\n$$q(t) = \\int \\dot{q} \\, \\mathrm{d}t = \\int v_0 \\, \\mathrm{d}t = v_0 t + q_0$$\nwhere $q_0$ is the initial position at $t=0$. Substituting the expression for $v_0$, we get:\n$$q(t) = \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{m}}\\right)t + q_0$$\nThis equation describes motion where the position $q$ is a linear function of time $t$. This is the definition of uniform linear motion. The verification is thus complete. The derived function $W(q)$ correctly generates the expected dynamics for a free particle.",

Work with a type-$2$ generating function $F_2(q,P)$, whose defining relations are $p=\\partial F_2/\\partial q$ and $Q=\\partial F_2/\\partial P$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard exercise in Hamiltonian mechanics concerning canonical transformations and generating functions. All definitions are standard and the tasks are logically connected, allowing for a unique derivation.\n\nThe problem asks for several derivations, culminating in a final expression for the type-$2$ generating function $F_2(q,P)$ for a linear shear transformation. We will proceed step-by-step.\n\nFirst, we compute the generating function $F_2(q,P)$ for the given time-independent shear transformation:\n$$Q = q$$\n$$P = p + \\alpha q$$\nwhere $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a constant. A type-$2$ generating function $F_2(q,P)$ is defined by the relations:\n$$p = \\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial q}$$\n$$Q = \\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial P}$$\nUsing the second defining relation and the given transformation $Q=q$, we have:\n$$\\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial P} = q$$\nWe can integrate this equation with respect to $P$, treating $q$ as a constant parameter. This yields:\n$$F_2(q,P) = \\int q \\, dP = qP + g(q)$$\nwhere $g(q)$ is an arbitrary function of $q$, which acts as the constant of integration.\n\nTo determine $g(q)$, we use the first defining relation, $p = \\partial F_2/\\partial q$. Differentiating our expression for $F_2(q,P)$ with respect to $q$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial q} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q} (qP + g(q)) = P + g'(q)$$\nwhere $g'(q) = dg/dq$. Therefore, we have an expression for $p$:\n$$p = P + g'(q)$$\nFrom the given transformation, we can also express the old momentum $p$ in terms of the new coordinates $(q,P)$:\n$$p = P - \\alpha q$$\nEquating the two expressions for $p$, we find:\n$$P + g'(q) = P - \\alpha q$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$g'(q) = -\\alpha q$$\nIntegrating with respect to $q$ gives the function $g(q)$:\n$$g(q) = \\int (-\\alpha q) \\, dq = -\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha q^2 + C$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. The generating function is thus:\n$$F_2(q,P) = qP - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha q^2 + C$$\nThe constant $C$ does not affect the transformation equations, as they only depend on the partial derivatives of $F_2$. It is standard to set this constant to zero for simplicity. So, the generating function for the shear is:\n$$F_2(q,P) = qP - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha q^2$$\n\nNext, we embed this transformation into a one-parameter family, where the transformation parameter is now $\\alpha t$:\n$$Q = q$$\n$$P = p + \\alpha t q$$\nBy direct analogy with the previous derivation (replacing the constant $\\alpha$ with the parameter $\\alpha t$), the corresponding time-dependent type-$2$ generating function $F_2(q,P,t)$ is:\n$$F_2(q,P,t) = qP - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha t q^2$$\n\nThe problem then requires us to identify a Hamiltonian $H(q,p)$ such that $F_2(q,P,t)$ is a solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation:\n$$\\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial t} + H\\left(q, \\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial q}\\right) = 0$$\nThis form of the HJ equation describes a canonical transformation to a system where the new Hamiltonian is zero. We compute the required partial derivatives of $F_2(q,P,t) = qP - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha t q^2$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha q^2$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial q} = P - \\alpha t q$$\nSubstituting these into the HJ equation gives:\n$$-\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha q^2 + H(q, P - \\alpha t q) = 0$$\nThis equation must hold as an identity for all valid $(q, P, t)$. From this equation, we can write:\n$$H(q, P - \\alpha t q) = \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha q^2$$\nThe expression on the right-hand side depends only on $q$. The second argument of the function $H$, which corresponds to the momentum $p = P - \\alpha t q$, can take any real value by varying $P$ and $t$ for a given $q$. For the equation to hold universally, the function $H(q,p)$ must be independent of its second argument, $p$. Therefore, we can identify the Hamiltonian as:\n$$H(q,p) = \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha q^2$$\n\nWe now explicitly verify that this choice of $H(q,p)$ and our derived $F_2(q,P,t)$ satisfy the HJ equation.\nThe left-hand side (LHS) of the HJ equation is $\\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial t} + H\\left(q, \\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial q}\\right)$.\nWe have $\\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha q^2$.\nThe Hamiltonian term is $H\\left(q, \\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial q}\\right) = H(q, P - \\alpha t q)$. Since our identified Hamiltonian is $H(q,p) = \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha q^2$, its value depends only on $q$. Thus:\n$$H(q, P - \\alpha t q) = \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha q^2$$\nSubstituting these back into the LHS of the HJ equation:\n$$\\text{LHS} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha q^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha q^2 = 0$$\nThis is equal to the right-hand side of the equation, so the verification is successful.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the single closed-form expression for the generating function $F_2(q,P)$ corresponding to the original shear, $P=p+\\alpha q$. This corresponds to setting the parameter $t=1$ in our one-parameter family. Evaluating $F_2(q,P,t)$ at $t=1$:\n$$F_2(q,P) = F_2(q,P,t=1) = qP - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha(1)q^2 = qP - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha q^2$$\nThis matches the result from our initial derivation, as expected.",
