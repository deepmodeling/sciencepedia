At its core is the concept of the augmented Hamiltonian, $H_\\xi$. This first exercise guides you through the fundamental derivation that connects the critical points of $H_\\xi$ to the relative equilibria of the system, which are motions that appear as stationary states in a suitably rotating frame. By working through this derivation, you will solidify your understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of the entire method.",

            "solution": "We begin from the foundational definitions in symplectic geometry. The Hamiltonian vector field $X_{H}$ associated with a smooth function $H:M\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is defined by the condition\n$$\n\\iota_{X_{H}}\\omega=dH,\n$$\nwhere $\\iota$ denotes interior contraction. For a Hamiltonian $G$-action with momentum map $J:M\\to\\mathfrak{g}^{*}$, the defining property of the momentum map is that for each $\\xi\\in\\mathfrak{g}$, the differential of the pairing $\\langle J,\\xi\\rangle$ satisfies\n$$\nd\\langle J,\\xi\\rangle=\\iota_{\\xi_{M}}\\omega,\n$$\nwhere $\\xi_{M}$ is the fundamental vector field generated by $\\xi\\in\\mathfrak{g}$ via the $G$-action on $M$.\n\nDefine the augmented Hamiltonian $H_{\\xi}:=H-\\langle J,\\xi\\rangle$. Its differential is\n$$\ndH_{\\xi}=dH-d\\langle J,\\xi\\rangle.\n$$\nSubstituting the defining relations, we obtain\n$$\ndH_{\\xi}=\\iota_{X_{H}}\\omega-\\iota_{\\xi_{M}}\\omega=\\iota_{X_{H}-\\xi_{M}}\\omega.\n$$\nTherefore, a point $m\\in M$ is a critical point of $H_{\\xi}$ if and only if\n$$\ndH_{\\xi}(m)=0\\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad \\iota_{X_{H}(m)-\\xi_{M}(m)}\\omega=0.\n$$\nSince $\\omega$ is nondegenerate, the condition $\\iota_{Y}\\omega=0$ implies $Y=0$. Hence,\n$$\nX_{H}(m)-\\xi_{M}(m)=0\\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad X_{H}(m)=\\xi_{M}(m).\n$$\nThis equality states that the Hamiltonian vector field at $m$ coincides with the infinitesimal generator of the group action with velocity $\\xi$. Consequently, the trajectory of the Hamiltonian flow through $m$ is tangent to the $G$-orbit generated by $\\xi$, which means $m$ is a relative equilibrium: its evolution under the Hamiltonian flow is equivalent to the action of a one-parameter subgroup of $G$.\n\nWe now specialize to $M=T^{*}S^{1}$ with coordinates $(q,p)$ and canonical symplectic form $\\omega=dq\\wedge dp$. The Hamiltonian is\n$$\nH(q,p)=\\frac{1}{2}p^{2}+V(q),\n$$\nand the $S^{1}$ action on the base coordinate $q$ is by rotations, so the corresponding fundamental vector field for $\\xi\\in\\mathbb{R}\\cong\\mathfrak{g}$ is\n$$\n\\xi_{M}=\\xi\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}.\n$$\nThe momentum map for the cotangent-lifted action is $J(q,p)=p$. Therefore,\n$$\nH_{\\xi}(q,p)=\\frac{1}{2}p^{2}+V(q)-\\xi\\,p.\n$$\nTo find the critical points, we compute the differential:\n$$\ndH_{\\xi}=\\left(p-\\xi\\right)\\,dp+V'(q)\\,dq.\n$$\nA point $m=(p_{0},q_{0})$ is a critical point of $H_{\\xi}$ if and only if both coefficients vanish at $(p_{0},q_{0})$:\n$$\np_{0}-\\xi=0,\\qquad V'(q_{0})=0.\n$$\nThe second condition $V'(q_{0})=0$ is given by hypothesis. The first condition then yields the required expression for $\\xi$:\n$$\n\\xi=p_{0}.\n$$\nThis is consistent with the characterization of relative equilibria derived above: at the point $(p_{0},q_{0})$, the Hamiltonian vector field $X_{H}(q,p)=\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}-\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}=p\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}-V'(q)\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$ satisfies $X_{H}(m)=p_{0}\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}$, while the group velocity field is $\\xi_{M}(m)=\\xi\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}$. Equating them yields $\\xi=p_{0}$, and the vanishing of $V'(q_{0})$ ensures $X_{H}(m)$ is tangent to the $S^{1}$-orbit with no component in the fiber direction. Thus, $m$ is a relative equilibrium with group velocity $\\xi=p_{0}$, and the condition $dH_{\\xi}(m)=0$ precisely encodes this property through the augmented Hamiltonian framework central to the energy-momentum method for stability.",
