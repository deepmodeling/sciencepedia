            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of action-angle variables for the one-degree-of-freedom harmonic oscillator, a fundamental and completely integrable system in Hamiltonian mechanics. We are given the Hamiltonian $H(q,p) = \\frac{p^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 q^2$ on the phase space $T^*\\mathbb{R}$ with canonical coordinates $(q,p)$ and symplectic form $\\omega_{\\text{can}} = dq \\wedge dp$.\n\nFirst, we compute the action variable $I(E)$. The action variable is defined by the integral $I(E) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\oint_{H=E} p\\,dq$, where the path of integration is a level set of the Hamiltonian for a fixed energy $E>0$. The level set is described by the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{p^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 q^2 = E\n$$\nThis equation describes an ellipse in the $(q,p)$ phase plane. We can rewrite it in standard form as:\n$$\n\\frac{q^2}{\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{m\\omega^2}}\\right)^2} + \\frac{p^2}{\\left(\\sqrt{2mE}\\right)^2} = 1\n$$\nThe integral is to be taken in the counterclockwise direction. We can evaluate it directly by parameterizing the path. A more direct method is to solve for $p$ as a function of $q$. From the Hamiltonian equation, we have $p(q) = \\pm\\sqrt{2mE - m^2\\omega^2 q^2}$. The extreme values for $q$ are reached when $p=0$, which gives $q_{\\text{max}} = -q_{\\text{min}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{m\\omega^2}}$. The integral is taken over one full period, from $q_{\\text{min}}$ to $q_{\\text{max}}$ along the upper branch ($p>0$) and back from $q_{\\text{max}}$ to $q_{\\text{min}}$ along the lower branch ($p<0$).\n$$\n\\oint_{H=E} p\\,dq = \\int_{-q_{\\text{max}}}^{q_{\\text{max}}} \\sqrt{2mE - m^2\\omega^2 q^2} \\,dq + \\int_{q_{\\text{max}}}^{-q_{\\text{max}}} \\left(-\\sqrt{2mE - m^2\\omega^2 q^2}\\right) \\,dq\n$$\n$$\n\\oint_{H=E} p\\,dq = 2 \\int_{-q_{\\text{max}}}^{q_{\\text{max}}} \\sqrt{2mE - m^2\\omega^2 q^2} \\,dq\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we perform a substitution. Let $q = q_{\\text{max}} \\sin\\phi = \\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{m\\omega^2}} \\sin\\phi$. Then $dq = \\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{m\\omega^2}} \\cos\\phi \\,d\\phi$. The limits of integration for $\\phi$ go from $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nThe integrand becomes:\n$$\n\\sqrt{2mE - m^2\\omega^2 \\left(\\frac{2E}{m\\omega^2}\\right) \\sin^2\\phi} = \\sqrt{2mE(1-\\sin^2\\phi)} = \\sqrt{2mE} |\\cos\\phi|\n$$\nSince $\\phi \\in [-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$, $\\cos\\phi \\ge 0$, so $|\\cos\\phi| = \\cos\\phi$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n2 \\int_{-\\frac{\\pi}{2}}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\left( \\sqrt{2mE} \\cos\\phi \\right) \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{m\\omega^2}} \\cos\\phi \\right) \\,d\\phi = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{4mE^2}{m\\omega^2}} \\int_{-\\frac{\\pi}{2}}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\cos^2\\phi \\,d\\phi\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{4E}{\\omega} \\int_{-\\frac{\\pi}{2}}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\frac{1+\\cos(2\\phi)}{2} \\,d\\phi = \\frac{2E}{\\omega} \\left[ \\phi + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(2\\phi) \\right]_{-\\frac{\\pi}{2}}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} = \\frac{2E}{\\omega} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{2\\pi E}{\\omega}\n$$\nThe integral $\\oint p\\,dq$ represents the area enclosed by the elliptical orbit in phase space. The action variable is this area divided by $2\\pi$:\n$$\nI(E) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi E}{\\omega} \\right) = \\frac{E}{\\omega}\n$$\nFrom this relationship, we can express the energy, and thus the Hamiltonian, as a function of the action variable alone: $E = H(I) = \\omega I$.\n\nNext, we construct the angle variable $\\theta(q,p)$, which is canonically conjugate to $I$. We seek a canonical transformation $(q,p) \\to (\\theta, I)$ such that the Hamiltonian becomes a function of $I$ only. A suitable transformation that leads to counterclockwise motion for increasing $\\theta$ is:\n$$\nq(I, \\theta) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2I}{m\\omega}} \\sin\\theta\n$$\n$$\np(I, \\theta) = \\sqrt{2m\\omega I} \\cos\\theta\n$$\nPlugging these into the Hamiltonian confirms our choice:\n$$\nH = \\frac{(\\sqrt{2m\\omega I} \\cos\\theta)^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2I}{m\\omega}} \\sin\\theta\\right)^2 = \\frac{2m\\omega I \\cos^2\\theta}{2m} + \\frac{m\\omega^2 2I}{2m\\omega} \\sin^2\\theta = \\omega I (\\cos^2\\theta + \\sin^2\\theta) = \\omega I\n$$\nTo find the explicit form of $\\theta(q,p)$, we can invert the transformation. From the relations above, we have:\n$$\n\\sin\\theta = q \\sqrt{\\frac{m\\omega}{2I}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\cos\\theta = p \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2m\\omega I}}\n$$\nSubstituting $I = H(q,p)/\\omega = \\frac{1}{\\omega}(\\frac{p^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 q^2)$, we get:\n$$\n\\sin\\theta = \\frac{m\\omega q}{\\sqrt{p^2 + (m\\omega q)^2}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\cos\\theta = \\frac{p}{\\sqrt{p^2 + (m\\omega q)^2}}\n$$\nThese two equations uniquely define the angle variable $\\theta(q,p)$ modulo $2\\pi$ for any $(q,p)$ other than the equilibrium point $(0,0)$. This corresponds to the four-quadrant arctangent function, $\\theta(q,p) = \\mathrm{atan2}(m\\omega q, p)$, where the first argument is proportional to sine and the second to cosine.\n\nWe now verify that the transformation is canonical by showing that the symplectic form is preserved, i.e., $dq \\wedge dp = d\\theta \\wedge dI$. We compute the exterior derivatives of $q$ and $p$:\n$$\ndq = \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial I}dI + \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial \\theta}d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{I}}\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m\\omega}}\\sin\\theta \\,dI + \\sqrt{\\frac{2I}{m\\omega}}\\cos\\theta \\,d\\theta = \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{\\sqrt{2m\\omega I}}dI + \\sqrt{\\frac{2I}{m\\omega}}\\cos\\theta \\,d\\theta\n$$\n$$\ndp = \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial I}dI + \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\theta}d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{I}}\\sqrt{2m\\omega}\\cos\\theta \\,dI - \\sqrt{2m\\omega I}\\sin\\theta \\,d\\theta = \\sqrt{\\frac{m\\omega}{2I}}\\cos\\theta \\,dI - \\sqrt{2m\\omega I}\\sin\\theta \\,d\\theta\n$$\nNow we compute the wedge product $dq \\wedge dp$. Only terms involving $dI \\wedge d\\theta$ and $d\\theta \\wedge dI$ will be non-zero.\n$$\ndq \\wedge dp = \\left( \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{\\sqrt{2m\\omega I}} \\right) \\left( -\\sqrt{2m\\omega I}\\sin\\theta \\right) dI \\wedge d\\theta + \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{2I}{m\\omega}}\\cos\\theta \\right) \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{m\\omega}{2I}}\\cos\\theta \\right) d\\theta \\wedge dI\n$$\n$$\ndq \\wedge dp = (-\\sin^2\\theta) \\, dI \\wedge d\\theta + (\\cos^2\\theta) \\, d\\theta \\wedge dI\n$$\nUsing the anti-commutative property $dI \\wedge d\\theta = -d\\theta \\wedge dI$:\n$$\ndq \\wedge dp = (\\sin^2\\theta) \\, d\\theta \\wedge dI + (\\cos^2\\theta) \\, d\\theta \\wedge dI = (\\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta) \\, d\\theta \\wedge dI = d\\theta \\wedge dI\n$$\nThis confirms that the transformation to $(\\theta, I)$ coordinates is canonical, as it preserves the structure of the symplectic form.\n\nFinally, we analyze the dynamics using Hamilton's equations in the action-angle coordinates. The Hamiltonian is $H(\\theta, I) = \\omega I$. The equations of motion are:\n$$\n\\dot{I} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial \\theta} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}(\\omega I) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{\\theta} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial I} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial I}(\\omega I) = \\omega\n$$\nThe first equation, $\\dot{I}=0$, shows that the action $I$ is a constant of motion, which is consistent with $I$ being a function of the conserved energy $E$. The second equation, $\\dot{\\theta}=\\omega$, shows that the angle variable $\\theta$ evolves linearly with time. Integrating with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\theta(t) = \\omega t + \\theta_0\n$$\nwhere $\\theta_0$ is a constant of integration representing the initial phase. The rate of change of the angle, $\\omega$, is the constant angular frequency of the oscillator. All angles are implicitly in radians as per standard mathematical convention.\nThe problem requests a final expression for $I(E)$. Based on our calculation, this is $I(E) = E/\\omega$.",

A fundamental property of the vector cross product is that the resulting vector $B \\times A$ is orthogonal to both $A$ and $B$. Therefore, the dot product of $A$ with $B \\times A$ must be zero:\n$$\nA \\cdot (B \\times A) = 0\n$$\nIn our case, $A = M$ and $B = \\nabla H(M)$. Applying this identity, we find:\n$$\n\\{H, C\\}(M) = - M \\cdot \\left( \\nabla H(M) \\times M \\right) = 0\n$$\nThus, the Poisson bracket of the Hamiltonian and the Casimir function is identically zero for all $M \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)^{*}$.\n\nNext, we explain why this result, combined with the geometric structure, implies Liouville integrability.\nThe space $\\mathfrak{so}(3)^{*}$ is a $3$-dimensional Poisson manifold. The dynamics of the system unfold on this manifold. The function $C(M)$ is a Casimir invariant, which means it Poisson-commutes with any smooth function $F: \\mathfrak{so}(3)^{*} \\to \\mathbb{R}$. We have just verified this for the specific case $F=H$, but it holds generally because $\\nabla C(M) = M$, so $\\{F, C\\}(M) = -M \\cdot (\\nabla F \\times M) = 0$.\n\nA consequence of $C$ being a Casimir is that the Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ is tangent to the level sets of $C$. The level sets $C(M) = c$ for constants $c > 0$ are spheres in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. These spheres are the coadjoint orbits of the $SO(3)$ action on $\\mathfrak{so}(3)^*$, and they are the symplectic leaves of the Poisson manifold. Each such sphere is a $2$-dimensional symplectic manifold.\n\nThe Liouville-Arnold theorem states that a Hamiltonian system on a $2n$-dimensional symplectic manifold is completely integrable if there exist $n$ functionally independent conserved quantities (integrals of motion) that are in involution (i.e., their mutual Poisson brackets are all zero).\n\nFor a generic coadjoint orbit (a sphere with radius $\\sqrt{2c}$), the dimension is $2n=2$, which implies $n=1$. We therefore need to find one integral of motion on this $2$-dimensional symplectic manifold. The Hamiltonian $H$ is always an integral of motion for its own flow, since $\\{H, H\\} = 0$. When restricted to a specific coadjoint orbit, $H$ is a smooth function. Since the problem specifies that the moments of inertia $I_1, I_2, I_3$ are distinct, the restriction of $H$ to any sphere $C=c > 0$ is not a constant function. This restricted Hamiltonian, $H|_{C=c}$, serves as the single integral required for Liouville integrability on the $2$-dimensional symplectic leaf. The trajectories of the system are the level curves of $H$ on the sphere.\n\nThe significance of the pair $(H, C)$ is understood on the full $3$-dimensional Poisson manifold $\\mathfrak{so}(3)^{*}$. We have two functions, $H$ and $C$, which satisfy $\\{H, C\\} = 0$. They are functionally independent on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ because their gradients, $\\nabla H = (\\frac{M_1}{I_1}, \\frac{M_2}{I_2}, \\frac{M_3}{I_3})$ and $\\nabla C = (M_1, M_2, M_3)$, are not parallel for generic $M$ (given distinct $I_k$). On a Poisson manifold of dimension $m=3$, the rank of the Poisson tensor is $2$ (away from $M=0$), meaning the dimension of its kernel is $k=1$. The number of integrals required for integrability in this context is $(m+k)/2 = (3+1)/2 = 2$. The functions $H$ and $C$ are precisely these two required independent integrals in involution. Their common level sets, which are the intersections of an ellipsoid (level set of $H$) and a sphere (level set of $C$), are the $1$-dimensional trajectories of the motion. This structure on the ambient $3$-dimensional space ensures that the dynamics restricted to each $2$-dimensional symplectic leaf (coadjoint orbit) is Liouville integrable.",

Integrating from $t=0$ to $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\alpha}^{p_{2}(t)} \\frac{d\\tilde{p}_{2}}{\\tilde{p}_{2}^{2}} = \\int_{0}^{t} d\\tau \\implies \\left[-\\frac{1}{\\tilde{p}_{2}}\\right]_{\\alpha}^{p_{2}(t)} = t \\implies -\\frac{1}{p_{2}(t)} + \\frac{1}{\\alpha} = t\n$$\nSolving for $p_{2}(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{p_{2}(t)} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} - t = \\frac{1 - \\alpha t}{\\alpha} \\implies p_{2}(t) = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha t}\n$$\nNow we solve for $q_{2}(t)$ using $\\dot{q}_{2} = -2 p_{2} q_{2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dq_{2}}{dt} = -2 \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha t}\\right) q_{2}\n$$\nThis is a separable linear ODE: $\\frac{dq_{2}}{q_{2}} = \\frac{-2\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha t} dt$. Integrating from $t=0$ to $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{q_{2,0}}^{q_{2}(t)} \\frac{d\\tilde{q}_{2}}{\\tilde{q}_{2}} = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{-2\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha \\tau} d\\tau \\implies \\left[\\ln|\\tilde{q}_{2}|\\right]_{q_{2,0}}^{q_{2}(t)} = \\left[2 \\ln|1 - \\alpha \\tau|\\right]_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln|q_{2}(t)| - \\ln|q_{2,0}| = 2 \\ln|1 - \\alpha t| - 2 \\ln(1) = \\ln((1 - \\alpha t)^{2})\n$$\n$$\nq_{2}(t) = q_{2,0} (1 - \\alpha t)^{2}\n$$\nSo, the flow $\\Phi_{F}^{t}$ is $\\Phi_{F}^{t}(q_{1,0}, p_{1,0}, q_{2,0}, \\alpha) = (q_{1,0}, p_{1,0}, q_{2,0}(1 - \\alpha t)^{2}, \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha t})$.\n\n**Task 3: Determine the maximal forward time of existence $T(\\alpha)$.**\nThe flow of $X_{F}$ is defined as long as its components are finite. Examining the expressions for the flow components, we see that $q_{1}(t)$, $p_{1}(t)$, and $q_{2}(t)$ are finite for all $t$ for which $p_{2}(t)$ is defined. The component $p_{2}(t) = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha t}$ exhibits a finite-time blow-up when the denominator becomes zero.\nWe set the denominator to zero to find the time of this singularity:\n$$\n1 - \\alpha t = 0 \\implies \\alpha t = 1\n$$\nSince $\\alpha > 0$ is given, the singularity occurs at a positive time $t = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}$.\nThe flow is defined on the interval $[0, \\frac{1}{\\alpha})$. The maximal forward time of existence, $T(\\alpha)$, is the supremum of this interval.\n$$\nT(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\n$$\n\n**Task 4: Analysis of completeness and Liouville integrability.**\nA dynamical system is said to be Liouville integrable if, on a $2n$-dimensional symplectic manifold, there exist $n$ independent functions $F_{1}, \\dots, F_{n}$ that are in involution (i.e., $\\{F_{i}, F_{j}\\} = 0$ for all $i,j$). The Liouville-Arnold theorem guarantees the existence of local action-angle coordinates around regular level sets of the momentum map $F = (F_1, \\dots, F_n)$. For these coordinates to be global, a stronger condition is required, namely that the Hamiltonian vector fields $X_{F_i}$ of all the integrals must be complete. A vector field is complete if its flow is defined for all time $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nIn this problem, the dimension is $2n=4$, so $n=2$. We have two integrals, $H$ and $F$, which are in involution. The system is therefore Liouville integrable in a local sense. However, as calculated in Task 3, the flow of $X_{F}$ blows up in finite forward time $T(\\alpha) = 1/\\alpha$ for any initial condition with $p_{2}(0) = \\alpha > 0$. This means the vector field $X_{F}$ is not complete.\n\nThe non-completeness of $X_F$ is a direct impediment to the existence of global action-angle coordinates for the integrable system $(H,F)$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$. The flows of $X_H$ and $X_F$ do not generate a global action of the group $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ on the phase space $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$. Consequently, while one can find local trivializations of the phase space into action-angle variables on certain open sets, these local coordinate systems cannot be extended to a single global chart covering the entire manifold due to the finite-time singularities. The system is integrable, but not globally integrable in the sense of admitting a global system of action-angle coordinates.",
