It is a standard, well-posed problem in geometric mechanics. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe task is twofold: first, to derive the general expression for the components of a Hamiltonian vector field in standard Darboux coordinates, and second, to apply this result to a specific Hamiltonian.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Components of $X_{H}$**\n\nWe are given a symplectic manifold $\\left(M, \\omega\\right)$ where $M = \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with local coordinates $\\left(q, p\\right)$. The symplectic form is $\\omega = dq \\wedge dp$. A general vector field $X_H$ on this space can be written in terms of the coordinate basis vector fields $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$ as:\n$$X_{H} = X_{H}^{q}\\left(q,p\\right)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q} + X_{H}^{p}\\left(q,p\\right)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$$\nwhere $X_{H}^{q}$ and $X_{H}^{p}$ are the component functions we seek to determine.\n\nThe Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ is implicitly defined by the equation $\\iota_{X_{H}}\\omega = dH$. This equation states that the $1$-form $\\iota_{X_H}\\omega$ is equal to the $1$-form $dH$. Two $1$-forms are equal if and only if they yield the same result when acting on any vector field. Let $Y$ be an arbitrary vector field. The defining relation is equivalent to:\n$$\\left(\\iota_{X_{H}}\\omega\\right)(Y) = (dH)(Y)$$\nBy definition of the interior product, $\\left(\\iota_{X_{H}}\\omega\\right)(Y) = \\omega(X_H, Y)$. By definition of the exterior derivative of a function, $(dH)(Y) = Y[H]$. Thus, the defining relation is equivalent to:\n$$\\omega\\left(X_{H}, Y\\right) = Y[H]$$\nfor all vector fields $Y$.\n\nTo find the components $X_{H}^{q}$ and $X_{H}^{p}$, we test this relation using the basis vector fields $Y = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}$ and $Y = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the action of the $2$-form $\\omega=dq\\wedge dp$ on pairs of basis vectors. Using the definition of the wedge product on basis vectors:\n$$\\omega\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\\right) = (dq \\wedge dp)\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\\right) = dq\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}\\right)dp\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\\right) - dq\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\\right)dp\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}\\right)$$\nSince $dq_i(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_j}) = \\delta_{ij}$, we have $dq(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}) = 1$, $dp(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}) = 1$, $dq(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}) = 0$, and $dp(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}) = 0$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\\omega\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\\right) = (1)(1) - (0)(0) = 1$$\nBy the skew-symmetry property of a $2$-form, $\\omega(Y_1, Y_2) = -\\omega(Y_2, Y_1)$:\n$$\\omega\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}\\right) = -1$$\nAnd, $\\omega\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}\\right) = 0$ and $\\omega\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\\right) = 0$.\n\nNow we test the defining relation.\nCase 1: Let $Y = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}$.\nThe right hand side is $(dH)\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q}$.\nThe left hand side is $\\omega\\left(X_{H}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}\\right)$. Using the bilinearity of $\\omega$:\n$$ \\omega\\left(X_{H}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}\\right) = \\omega\\left(X_{H}^{q}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q} + X_{H}^{p}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}\\right) = X_{H}^{q}\\omega\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}\\right) + X_{H}^{p}\\omega\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}\\right) $$\n$$ = X_{H}^{q}(0) + X_{H}^{p}(-1) = -X_{H}^{p} $$\nEquating the left and right sides:\n$$-X_{H}^{p} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q} \\implies X_{H}^{p} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q}$$\n\nCase 2: Let $Y = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$.\nThe right hand side is $(dH)\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p}$.\nThe left hand side is $\\omega\\left(X_{H}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\\right)$. Using bilinearity:\n$$ \\omega\\left(X_{H}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\\right) = \\omega\\left(X_{H}^{q}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q} + X_{H}^{p}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\\right) = X_{H}^{q}\\omega\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\\right) + X_{H}^{p}\\omega\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\\right) $$\n$$ = X_{H}^{q}(1) + X_{H}^{p}(0) = X_{H}^{q} $$\nEquating the left and right sides:\n$$X_{H}^{q} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p}$$\n\nThus, we have derived the components of the Hamiltonian vector field in these coordinates:\n$$X_{H}^{q} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad X_{H}^{p} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q}$$\nThe full vector field is $X_{H} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q} - \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$. The integral curves $\\gamma(t) = (q(t), p(t))$ of this vector field satisfy Hamilton's equations: $\\dot{q} = X_H^q = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p}$ and $\\dot{p} = X_H^p = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q}$.\n\n**Part 2: Application to a Specific Hamiltonian**\n\nWe are given the Hamiltonian for the simple harmonic oscillator:\n$$H\\left(q, p\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(p^{2} + q^{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}p^{2} + \\frac{1}{2}q^{2}$$\nWe compute the partial derivatives of $H$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}p^{2} + \\frac{1}{2}q^{2}\\right) = q$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}p^{2} + \\frac{1}{2}q^{2}\\right) = p$$\nNow we substitute these into the general expressions for the components of $X_H$:\n$$X_{H}^{q} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} = p$$\n$$X_{H}^{p} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q} = -q$$\nThe components of the Hamiltonian vector field are $(X_{H}^{q}, X_{H}^{p}) = (p, -q)$. The vector field itself is $X_{H} = p\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q} - q\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer as a single two-entry row vector $\\left(X_{H}^{q},\\,X_{H}^{p}\\right)$.",

It is a known result that for any central potential, the angular momentum vector is conserved.

At $P_0$, $\\nabla L_2|_{P_0} = (-1, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1)$.\n$\\nabla L_3 = (\\frac{\\partial L_3}{\\partial q_1}, \\dots, \\frac{\\partial L_3}{\\partial p_3}) = (p_2, -p_1, 0, -q_2, q_1, 0)$. At $P_0$, $\\nabla L_3|_{P_0} = (1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0)$.\nSo, $\\nabla F_2|_{P_0} = -2(-1, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1) + 2(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0) = (2,0,0,0,0,2) + (2,0,0,0,2,0) = (4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2)$.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix $dF$ at $P_0$ is:\n$$\ndF|_{P_0} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1  0  0  0  1  1 \\\\\n4  0  0  0  2  2 \\\\\n1  0  0  0  1  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo find the rank, we check for linear independence of the row vectors. Let the rows be $r_1, r_2, r_3$.\n$r_1 = (1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1)$\n$r_2 = (4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2)$\n$r_3 = (1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0)$\nWe can perform row operations to find the rank.\n$R_2 \\to R_2 - 4 R_1$: $\\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0  0  1  1 \\\\ 0  0  0  0  -2  -2 \\\\ 1  0  0  0  1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$R_3 \\to R_3 - R_1$: $\\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0  0  1  1 \\\\ 0  0  0  0  -2  -2 \\\\ 0  0  0  0  0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\nThe resulting matrix is in row echelon form (ignoring the zero columns). We see three non-zero rows, which are clearly linearly independent. For instance, the last row has a non-zero entry in the last column, while the second row has a zero there. The first row has non-zero entries where the other two might not.\nThus, the rank of the matrix is $3$.\n\nPart 3: Liouville Integrability\n\nFor a Hamiltonian system on a $2n$-dimensional symplectic manifold to be Liouville completely integrable, we need to find $n$ functionally independent first integrals that are in pairwise Poisson involution.\nHere, the dimension of the phase space $\\mathbb{R}^6$ is $2n=6$, so we need $n=3$ such functions. We are given the set $(F_1, F_2, F_3)$.\n1.  **Poisson Involution**: In Part 1, we established that $\\{F_i, F_j\\} = 0$ for all $i, j \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. This condition is satisfied.\n2.  **Functional Independence**: For the functions to be functionally independent in a neighborhood of a point, their differentials (gradients) must be linearly independent at that point. The rank of the Jacobian matrix $dF$ gives the number of linearly independent differentials. In Part 2, we computed $\\operatorname{rank}(dF|_{P_0}) = 3$. Since the rank equals the number of functions, the functions $F_1, F_2, F_3$ are functionally independent in a neighborhood of the point $P_0$.\n\nSince we have found $n=3$ functions that are in Poisson involution and are functionally independent on an open set containing the point $((1,0,0),(0,1,1))$, we conclude that the triple $(F_1, F_2, F_3)$ provides a Liouville completely integrable set for the Hamiltonian system defined by $H=F_1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $\\operatorname{rank}\\big(dF\\big)$ at the given point as the final answer. Based on the calculation in Part 2, this value is $3$.",

            "introduction": "Once a system is known to be integrable, the theory guarantees the existence of special \"action-angle\" coordinates in which the motion becomes strikingly simple. This final exercise demonstrates how these crucial action variables are constructed in practice for the famous Neumann integrable system, which describes motion on a sphere under a quadratic potential . You will use the powerful Hamilton-Jacobi method to separate variables and then perform an explicit integration to find an action variable, turning abstract theory into a concrete calculation.",

            "solution": "The problem is presented in three parts. We will address each part systematically. The problem statement is valid as it is scientifically grounded in classical mechanics, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent.\n\n**Part 1: Hamiltonian in Spherical Coordinates**\n\nThe objective is to express the given Hamiltonian in spherical coordinates $(\\theta, \\varphi)$ and their conjugate momenta $(p_{\\theta}, p_{\\varphi})$. The Hamiltonian is the sum of kinetic and potential energy, $H = T + V$. We will transform each term separately.\n\nThe configuration space is the unit sphere $S^2$. The kinetic energy of a particle of unit mass ($m=1$) moving on a Riemannian manifold with metric tensor $g$ is given in Hamiltonian formalism as $T = \\frac{1}{2}g^{ij}p_i p_j$, where $p_i$ are the canonical momenta conjugate to the coordinates $q^i$.\n\nFor the unit sphere $S^2$, the standard spherical coordinates are $q_1 = \\sin\\theta \\cos\\varphi$, $q_2 = \\sin\\theta \\sin\\varphi$, and $q_3 = \\cos\\theta$. The line element $ds^2$ on the sphere is given by $ds^2 = d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta \\, d\\varphi^2$. The metric tensor in these coordinates $(\\theta, \\varphi)$ is thus diagonal:\n$$\ng_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  \\sin^2\\theta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe inverse metric tensor $g^{ij}$ is:\n$$\ng^{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  \\frac{1}{\\sin^2\\theta} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe kinetic energy term in the Hamiltonian, expressed in terms of the canonical momenta $p_{\\theta}$ and $p_{\\varphi}$, is therefore:\n$$\nT = \\frac{1}{2} (g^{\\theta\\theta}p_{\\theta}^2 + g^{\\varphi\\varphi}p_{\\varphi}^2) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 \\cdot p_{\\theta}^2 + \\frac{1}{\\sin^2\\theta} \\cdot p_{\\varphi}^2\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(p_{\\theta}^2 + \\frac{p_{\\varphi}^2}{\\sin^2\\theta}\\right)\n$$\nThe potential energy is given as $V(q) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^3 a_i q_i^2$. With the specified parameters $a_1=0$, $a_2=0$, and $a_3=\\Omega^2$, this becomes $V(q) = \\frac{1}{2}\\Omega^2 q_3^2$. Substituting the spherical coordinate expression for $q_3$, we get:\n$$\nV(\\theta, \\varphi) = \\frac{1}{2}\\Omega^2 (\\cos\\theta)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\Omega^2 \\cos^2\\theta\n$$\nThe total Hamiltonian is the sum $H = T + V$:\n$$\nH(\\theta,\\varphi;p_{\\theta},p_{\\varphi}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(p_{\\theta}^{2} + \\frac{p_{\\varphi}^{2}}{\\sin^{2}\\theta}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\Omega^{2}\\,\\cos^{2}\\theta.\n$$\nThis matches the expression given in the problem statement.\n\n**Part 2: Hamilton-Jacobi Separation**\n\nWe use the time-independent Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation, which states that $H(q, \\partial S / \\partial q) = E$, where $S$ is Hamilton's principal function (or characteristic function for the time-independent case) and $E$ is the constant energy of the system. We identify the canonical momenta as $p_i = \\partial S / \\partial q^i$.\n\nIn our case, with coordinates $(\\theta, \\varphi)$, the HJ equation is:\n$$\nH\\left(\\theta, \\varphi, \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\theta}, \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\varphi}\\right) = E\n$$\nSubstituting the Hamiltonian from Part 1:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\theta}\\right)^{2} + \\frac{1}{\\sin^{2}\\theta}\\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\varphi}\\right)^{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\Omega^{2}\\,\\cos^{2}\\theta = E\n$$\nThe problem provides the separation ansatz $S(\\theta,\\varphi; E,L) = S_{\\theta}(\\theta; E,L) + L\\varphi$. The coordinate $\\varphi$ is cyclic as the Hamiltonian does not explicitly depend on it, which implies that its conjugate momentum $p_{\\varphi}$ is a constant of motion. The ansatz uses this fact by setting $\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\varphi} = p_{\\varphi} = L$, where $L$ is a separation constant. We also have $\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\theta} = \\frac{d S_{\\theta}}{d\\theta}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the HJ equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left(\\frac{d S_{\\theta}}{d\\theta}\\right)^{2} + \\frac{L^{2}}{\\sin^{2}\\theta}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\Omega^{2}\\,\\cos^{2}\\theta = E\n$$\nThe conjugate momentum $p_{\\theta}$ is given by $p_{\\theta} = \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\theta} = \\frac{d S_{\\theta}}{d\\theta}$. Substituting $p_{\\theta}$ into the equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\left(p_{\\theta}^{2} + \\frac{L^{2}}{\\sin^{2}\\theta}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\Omega^{2}\\,\\cos^{2}\\theta = E\n$$\nMultiplying by $2$ and rearranging to solve for $p_{\\theta}^2$:\n$$\np_{\\theta}^{2} + \\frac{L^{2}}{\\sin^{2}\\theta} + \\Omega^{2}\\,\\cos^{2}\\theta = 2E\n$$\n$$\np_{\\theta}^{2} = 2E - \\frac{L^{2}}{\\sin^{2}\\theta} - \\Omega^{2}\\,\\cos^{2}\\theta\n$$\nThis is the desired separated relation for the momentum $p_{\\theta}$.\n\n**Part 3: Action Variable Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to compute the action variable $J_{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\oint p_{\\theta}\\,d\\theta$ for the specific case where the separation constant (angular momentum about the $z$-axis) is $L=0$ and the energy is $E = \\frac{1}{2}\\Omega^2$.\n\nFirst, we substitute these values into the expression for $p_{\\theta}^2$ derived in Part 2:\n$$\np_{\\theta}^{2} = 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\Omega^2\\right) - \\frac{0^2}{\\sin^{2}\\theta} - \\Omega^{2}\\cos^{2}\\theta = \\Omega^2 - \\Omega^2\\cos^2\\theta\n$$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta = 1$, we get:\n$$\np_{\\theta}^{2} = \\Omega^2(1 - \\cos^2\\theta) = \\Omega^2\\sin^2\\theta\n$$\nTaking the square root, we find the momentum:\n$$\np_{\\theta} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\Omega^2\\sin^2\\theta} = \\pm \\Omega |\\sin\\theta|\n$$\nFor the standard range of the polar angle $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$, $\\sin\\theta \\ge 0$, so we can write $p_{\\theta} = \\pm \\Omega \\sin\\theta$.\n\nThe integral for the action variable is taken over one complete cycle of the $\\theta$ motion. The turning points of the motion occur where the kinetic energy in the $\\theta$ direction is zero, i.e., $p_{\\theta}=0$.\n$$\np_{\\theta} = 0 \\implies \\Omega \\sin\\theta = 0 \\implies \\sin\\theta = 0\n$$\nThis occurs at $\\theta = 0$ and $\\theta = \\pi$. These are the North and South poles of the sphere. The particle oscillates between these two poles.\n\nA full cycle of oscillation consists of $\\theta$ traveling from $0$ to $\\pi$ and then back from $\\pi$ to $0$.\nDuring the first half of the cycle ($\\theta$ from $0$ to $\\pi$), $\\dot{\\theta} = p_{\\theta}/m = p_{\\theta}$ (since $m=1$) must be positive. We choose $p_{\\theta} = +\\Omega \\sin\\theta$.\nDuring the second half of the cycle ($\\theta$ from $\\pi$ to $0$), $\\dot{\\theta}$ must be negative. We choose $p_{\\theta} = -\\Omega \\sin\\theta$.\n\nThe loop integral $\\oint p_{\\theta}\\,d\\theta$ is calculated as:\n$$\n\\oint p_{\\theta}\\,d\\theta = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} (+\\Omega \\sin\\theta)\\,d\\theta + \\int_{\\pi}^{0} (-\\Omega \\sin\\theta)\\,d\\theta\n$$\nWe can rewrite the second integral:\n$$\n\\int_{\\pi}^{0} (-\\Omega \\sin\\theta)\\,d\\theta = \\Omega \\int_{\\pi}^{0} (-\\sin\\theta)\\,d\\theta = \\Omega \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin\\theta\\,d\\theta\n$$\nThus, the loop integral is:\n$$\n\\oint p_{\\theta}\\,d\\theta = 2\\Omega \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin\\theta\\,d\\theta\n$$\nEvaluating the definite integral:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin\\theta\\,d\\theta = [-\\cos\\theta]_{0}^{\\pi} = (-\\cos(\\pi)) - (-\\cos(0)) = (-(-1)) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2\n$$\nSubstituting this result back:\n$$\n\\oint p_{\\theta}\\,d\\theta = 2\\Omega \\cdot 2 = 4\\Omega\n$$\nFinally, we compute the action variable $J_{\\theta}$:\n$$\nJ_{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\oint p_{\\theta}\\,d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}(4\\Omega) = \\frac{2\\Omega}{\\pi}\n$$",
