It is a well-posed, scientifically sound problem in the field of geometric mechanics. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe three required steps will be performed sequentially to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Condition on $\\lambda$ for the critical point**\n\nThe energy-Casimir functional is given by $\\mathcal{E}(m) = H(m) + \\lambda \\|m\\|^{2}$. We can write this explicitly in terms of the components of $m = (m_1, m_2, m_3)$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}(m_1, m_2, m_3) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{m_{1}^{2}}{I_{1}} + \\frac{m_{2}^{2}}{I_{2}} + \\frac{m_{3}^{2}}{I_{3}}\\right) + \\lambda(m_{1}^{2} + m_{2}^{2} + m_{3}^{2})\n$$\nThis can be regrouped as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}(m) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2I_1} + \\lambda\\right) m_1^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2I_2} + \\lambda\\right) m_2^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2I_3} + \\lambda\\right) m_3^2\n$$\nA point $m^{\\ast}$ is a critical point of $\\mathcal{E}$ if the differential (or gradient) of $\\mathcal{E}$ vanishes at $m^{\\ast}$, i.e., $d\\mathcal{E}(m^{\\ast}) = 0$. The partial derivatives of $\\mathcal{E}$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{E}}{\\partial m_1} = 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2I_1} + \\lambda\\right) m_1 = \\left(\\frac{1}{I_1} + 2\\lambda\\right) m_1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{E}}{\\partial m_2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{I_2} + 2\\lambda\\right) m_2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{E}}{\\partial m_3} = \\left(\\frac{1}{I_3} + 2\\lambda\\right) m_3\n$$\nThe relative equilibrium is given as $m^{\\ast} = M \\mathbf{e}_{2} = (0, M, 0)$, where $M \\neq 0$. We evaluate the gradient at this point:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{E}}{\\partial m_1}\\bigg|_{m^{\\ast}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{I_1} + 2\\lambda\\right) (0) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{E}}{\\partial m_2}\\bigg|_{m^{\\ast}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{I_2} + 2\\lambda\\right) M\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{E}}{\\partial m_3}\\bigg|_{m^{\\ast}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{I_3} + 2\\lambda\\right) (0) = 0\n$$\nFor the gradient to be the zero vector, the second component must be zero. Since $M \\neq 0$, this requires the term in parentheses to be zero:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{I_2} + 2\\lambda = 0 \\implies 2\\lambda = -\\frac{1}{I_2} \\implies \\lambda = -\\frac{1}{2I_2}\n$$\nThis is the condition on $\\lambda$.\n\n**Step 2: Hessian of $\\mathcal{E}$ at $m^{\\ast}$**\n\nThe Hessian of $\\mathcal{E}$ is the matrix of second partial derivatives, $D^2\\mathcal{E}(m) = \\left[\\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathcal{E}}{\\partial m_i \\partial m_j}\\right]$. The second derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathcal{E}}{\\partial m_1^2} = \\frac{1}{I_1} + 2\\lambda\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathcal{E}}{\\partial m_2^2} = \\frac{1}{I_2} + 2\\lambda\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathcal{E}}{\\partial m_3^2} = \\frac{1}{I_3} + 2\\lambda\n$$\nAll mixed partial derivatives $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathcal{E}}{\\partial m_i \\partial m_j}$ for $i \\neq j$ are zero. Thus, the Hessian is a diagonal matrix, and its value is constant (independent of $m$).\nTo find the Hessian at the critical point $m^{\\ast}$, we substitute the value $2\\lambda = -1/I_2$ found in Step 1:\n$$\nD^2\\mathcal{E}(m^{\\ast}) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{I_1} - \\frac{1}{I_2}  0  0 \\\\\n0  \\frac{1}{I_2} - \\frac{1}{I_2}  0 \\\\\n0  0  \\frac{1}{I_3} - \\frac{1}{I_2}\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{I_2 - I_1}{I_1 I_2}  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  \\frac{I_2 - I_3}{I_2 I_3}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Determinant of the restricted Hessian**\n\nThe coadjoint orbits of $\\mathfrak{so}(3)^{*}$ are spheres centered at the origin. The orbit passing through $m^{\\ast} = (0, M, 0)$ is the sphere $\\|m\\|^2 = M^2$. The tangent space to this orbit at $m^{\\ast}$, denoted $T_{m^{\\ast}}\\mathcal{O}$, is the set of all vectors $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ that are orthogonal to $m^{\\ast}$.\n$$\nv \\cdot m^{\\ast} = 0 \\implies (v_1, v_2, v_3) \\cdot (0, M, 0) = M v_2 = 0\n$$\nSince $M \\neq 0$, we have $v_2 = 0$. This means the tangent space is the $m_1$-$m_3$ plane, which is spanned by the basis vectors $\\mathbf{e}_1 = (1, 0, 0)$ and $\\mathbf{e}_3 = (0, 0, 1)$.\n\nTo find the restricted Hessian, we consider the quadratic form $q(v) = v^{T} [D^2\\mathcal{E}(m^{\\ast})] v$ for any vector $v \\in T_{m^{\\ast}}\\mathcal{O}$. A vector in the tangent space can be written as $v = c_1 \\mathbf{e}_1 + c_3 \\mathbf{e}_3 = (c_1, 0, c_3)$. The matrix of the restricted Hessian, $H_{res}$, in the basis $\\{\\mathbf{e}_1, \\mathbf{e}_3\\}$ is the $2 \\times 2$ submatrix of $D^2\\mathcal{E}(m^{\\ast})$ corresponding to the first and third rows and columns.\n$$\nH_{res} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{I_2 - I_1}{I_1 I_2}  0 \\\\\n0  \\frac{I_2 - I_3}{I_2 I_3}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of this restricted Hessian is the product of its diagonal entries:\n$$\n\\det(H_{res}) = \\left(\\frac{I_2 - I_1}{I_1 I_2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{I_2 - I_3}{I_2 I_3}\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the expression, we get the final result:\n$$\n\\det(H_{res}) = \\frac{(I_2 - I_1)(I_2 - I_3)}{I_1 I_2^2 I_3}\n$$\nGiven the ordering $0  I_{1}  I_{2}  I_{3}$, we have $I_2 - I_1 > 0$ and $I_2 - I_3  0$, which implies that the determinant is negative. This indicates that the restricted Hessian is indefinite, meaning the equilibrium is a saddle point of the effective potential $\\mathcal{E}$ on the coadjoint orbit, and is therefore unstable.",

For a general Lie group $G$ with Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, its formula involves the Lie bracket on $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n        *   The symmetry group in this problem is $G = \\mathrm{SO}(2)$, which is an abelian group. Its Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g} \\cong \\mathbb{R}$ is also abelian. This means that the Lie bracket of any two elements in $\\mathfrak{g}$ is identically zero.\n        *   Since the Arnold form's definition intrinsically depends on this Lie bracket, the Arnold form is identically zero for any abelian symmetry group.\n        *   Therefore, the Arnold form makes no contribution to the quadratic form governing stability in this case. The stability is determined exclusively by the definiteness of the second variation of the augmented potential, $\\delta^2 V_\\xi$.\n\n    *   **Critical Spin for Stability**\n        *   The upright spinning top ($\\theta=0$) is a stable relative equilibrium if the total quadratic form is positive definite for all admissible variations. As the Arnold form is zero, this condition reduces to requiring the second variation of the augmented potential, $\\delta^2 V_{\\xi}$, to be positive definite at $\\theta=0$.\n        *   This requires the coefficient of $(\\delta\\theta)^2$ to be positive:\n        $$ \\Omega^2(I_3-I_1) - mgc > 0 $$\n        *   We analyze this inequality. The term $mgc$ is strictly positive. If $I_3 \\le I_1$ (an oblate or spherical top), the term $\\Omega^2(I_3-I_1)$ is non-positive. In this case, the inequality can never be satisfied, and the upright equilibrium is always unstable. This is physically correct.\n        *   For the upright equilibrium to be potentially stable, we must have $I_3 > I_1$ (a prolate or \"fast\" top). Under this assumption, we can solve for $\\Omega^2$:\n        $$ \\Omega^2(I_3-I_1) > mgc \\implies \\Omega^2 > \\frac{mgc}{I_3-I_1} $$\n        *   The top is stable if its spin magnitude $|\\Omega|$ exceeds a critical value. The critical spin rate, $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, is the minimum value of $|\\Omega|$ for which stability is achieved.\n        $$ \\Omega_{\\mathrm{crit}}^2 = \\frac{mgc}{I_3-I_1} $$\n        *   Taking the positive square root, we find the critical spin magnitude:\n        $$ \\Omega_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{mgc}{I_3-I_1}} $$\nThis expression represents the minimum spin rate, in radians per second, required to stabilize the top in its upright \"sleeping\" position against gravitational perturbations.",

The symplectic form is the standard one, given by $\\omega = dq \\wedge dp$. The Hamiltonian $H$ is of the simple mechanical type $H(q,p) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|p\\|^2 + V(\\|q\\|)$, where $V$ is a smooth, radially symmetric potential depending only on the radius $r = \\|q\\|$.\n\nLet the Special Orthogonal group in two dimensions ($\\mathrm{SO}(2)$) act on the configuration space by rotations, with the action lifted to $T^*\\mathbb{R}^2$ in the canonical way. The associated momentum map $J: T^*\\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is the scalar angular momentum $J(q,p) = q_1 p_2 - q_2 p_1$.

Then, design a numerical method to construct all positive radii $r > 0$ of relative equilibria for a given smooth central potential $V(r)$ and fixed angular momentum $\\mu$, and verify their stability by assessing the definiteness of the second variation of the reduced energy along the radial direction. Express angular velocities $\\omega$ in radians per unit time.\n\nYour task is to implement a program that, for each provided test case, performs the following:\n- Constructs all positive radii $r$ that are stationary for the symplectically reduced radial dynamics at fixed angular momentum $J = \\mu$.\n- For each such radius $r$, computes the angular velocity $\\omega$ associated with the relative equilibrium.\n- Classifies radial stability by checking whether the second variation in the reduced one-degree-of-freedom problem is positive at $r$; return $True$ if it is positive and $False$ otherwise.\n\nYour program must handle the following test suite.

            "solution": "We begin from the fundamental definitions of Hamiltonian systems and symmetries. The phase space is $T^*\\mathbb{R}^2$ with canonical coordinates $(q,p)$ and standard symplectic form $\\omega = dq \\wedge dp$. The Hamiltonian is $H(q,p) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|p\\|^2 + V(\\|q\\|)$, where $V$ is a smooth central potential depending on the radius $r = \\|q\\|$. The Special Orthogonal group in two dimensions ($\\mathrm{SO}(2)$) acts on the configuration space $\\mathbb{R}^2$ by rotations, and its cotangent lift acts on $T^*\\mathbb{R}^2$ preserving the symplectic form. The associated momentum map $J: T^*\\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is the scalar angular momentum $J(q,p) = q_1 p_2 - q_2 p_1$.\n\nA relative equilibrium is defined as a point $z \\in T^*\\mathbb{R}^2$ such that there exists $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{so}(2)$ (which can be identified with a scalar angular velocity $\\omega$) for which the Hamiltonian vector field equals the infinitesimal generator of the group action at $z$, namely $X_H(z) = \\xi_{T^*\\mathbb{R}^2}(z)$. For simple mechanical systems with this symmetry, symplectic reduction at a fixed value $J = \\mu$ leads to dynamics on a reduced space parameterized by the radial coordinate $r$ and its conjugate radial momentum $p_r$. The reduction exploits the invariance of $H$ under $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ and the conservation of $J$ along trajectories.\n\nOn the level set $J = \\mu$, the effective reduced Hamiltonian in the radial variables $(r, p_r)$ is of the form\n$$\nH_{\\mathrm{red}}(r,p_r; \\mu) = \\frac{1}{2} p_r^2 + V_{\\mathrm{eff}}(r; \\mu),\n$$\nwhere the effective potential $V_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ arises from the original potential $V$ together with the centrifugal contribution due to fixed angular momentum. The reduced equations of motion imply that equilibria in the reduced dynamics correspond to critical points of $V_{\\mathrm{eff}}(r; \\mu)$. Specifically, equilibria satisfy $p_r = 0$ and\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dr} V_{\\mathrm{eff}}(r; \\mu) = 0.\n$$\n\nWe now derive the explicit form of $V_{\\mathrm{eff}}(r; \\mu)$. In polar coordinates, the kinetic energy decomposes into radial and angular parts, with the angular part constrained by the fixed angular momentum $J = \\mu$. The standard mechanical reduction yields\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{eff}}(r; \\mu) = V(r) + \\frac{\\mu^2}{2 r^2},\n$$\nwhere the additional term $\\frac{\\mu^2}{2 r^2}$ encodes the centrifugal barrier. Therefore, stationary radii $r > 0$ are solutions of\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dr} V_{\\mathrm{eff}}(r; \\mu) = \\frac{d}{dr} V(r) - \\frac{\\mu^2}{r^3} = 0.\n$$\nThe angular velocity $\\omega$ of the relative equilibrium follows from the kinematics with fixed angular momentum in planar motion,\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{\\mu}{r^2},\n$$\nwhich is expressed in radians per unit time.\n\nTo assess stability, we consider the second variation of the reduced energy along the radial direction. Linearizing the reduced one-degree-of-freedom system about the stationary radius yields the condition\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{dr^2} V_{\\mathrm{eff}}(r; \\mu) = \\frac{d^2}{dr^2} V(r) + \\frac{3 \\mu^2}{r^4}.\n$$\nPositivity of this second derivative at the equilibrium radius ensures that the equilibrium is a local minimum of $V_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and is linearly stable in the reduced dynamics. In the context of the energy-momentum method for simple mechanical systems with $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ symmetry in the plane, positivity of this reduced Hessian along the radial direction suffices to conclude formal stability of the relative equilibrium modulo the group action. We therefore classify stability using the sign of $\\frac{d^2}{dr^2} V_{\\mathrm{eff}}(r; \\mu)$ at each stationary radius.\n\nAlgorithmic design:\n1. For each test case, define $V(r)$, its first derivative $\\frac{d}{dr} V(r)$, and its second derivative $\\frac{d^2}{dr^2} V(r)$ according to the specified potential type and parameters.\n   - Harmonic potential: $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa r^2$, hence $\\frac{d}{dr} V(r) = \\kappa r$ and $\\frac{d^2}{dr^2} V(r) = \\kappa$.\n   - Kepler plus confining potential: $V(r) = -\\alpha / r + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta r^2$, hence $\\frac{d}{dr} V(r) = \\alpha / r^2 + \\beta r$ and $\\frac{d^2}{dr^2} V(r) = -2\\alpha / r^3 + \\beta$.\n   - Sextic polynomial potential: $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa r^2 - \\frac{1}{4}\\delta r^4 + 0.1 \\lambda r^6$, hence $\\frac{d}{dr} V(r) = \\kappa r - \\delta r^3 + 0.6 \\lambda r^5$ and $\\frac{d^2}{dr^2} V(r) = \\kappa - 3 \\delta r^2 + 3.0 \\lambda r^4$.\n\n2. Construct the derivative of the effective potential:\n   $$\n   F(r; \\mu) := \\frac{d}{dr} V_{\\mathrm{eff}}(r; \\mu) = \\frac{d}{dr} V(r) - \\frac{\\mu^2}{r^3}.\n   $$\n   The domain constraint is $r > 0$. Note that as $r \\to 0^+$, $F(r; \\mu) \\to -\\infty$ due to the centrifugal term when $\\mu \\neq 0$.\n\n3. Find all roots of $F(r; \\mu) = 0$ for $r > 0$:\n   - Use a bracketed root-finding approach based on sign changes of $F$ across a grid of $r$ values in an interval $[r_{\\min}, r_{\\max}]$ with $r_{\\min}$ small (e.g., $10^{-6}$) and $r_{\\max}$ chosen sufficiently large to capture all potential stationary radii relevant to the specified potentials.\n   - For each adjacent pair of grid points $(a,b)$ with $F(a) \\cdot F(b)  0$, apply a robust scalar root-finding method (Brent's method) to locate a root in $(a,b)$.\n   - Deduplicate roots that are numerically close to each other under a tolerance.\n\n4. For each root $r$ found:\n   - Compute $\\omega = \\mu / r^2$ (radians per unit time).\n   - Compute $G(r; \\mu) := \\frac{d^2}{dr^2} V_{\\mathrm{eff}}(r; \\mu) = \\frac{d^2}{dr^2} V(r) + \\frac{3 \\mu^2}{r^4}$.\n   - Classify stability via $s = (G(r; \\mu) > 0)$.\n\n5. Return, for each test case, the list of $[r, \\omega, s]$ triples sorted by increasing $r$. If no roots exist, return an empty list for that case.\n\nNumerical considerations:\n- The function $F(r; \\mu)$ has a singularity at $r = 0$ for $\\mu \\neq 0$, but the algorithm avoids this by starting the search at $r_{\\min} = 10^{-6}$.\n- For the Kepler potential $V(r) = -\\alpha / r$ with $\\alpha > 0$, there is exactly one physically relevant root at $r = \\mu^2 / \\alpha$, and the second derivative $G(r; \\mu)$ is positive, indicating stability.\n- For convex potentials like the harmonic case with $\\kappa > 0$, the stationary radius is unique and stable.\n- For multiwell polynomial potentials, multiple stationary radii can exist; the algorithm discovers all sign changes and classifies each equilibrium accordingly.\n- For an inverted harmonic potential with $\\kappa  0$, $F(r; \\mu)$ remains negative for all $r > 0$ (for $\\mu \\neq 0$), so no positive stationary radius exists.\n\nThe program implements these steps for the specified test suite and prints a single line containing the aggregated results across all test cases in the required format.",
