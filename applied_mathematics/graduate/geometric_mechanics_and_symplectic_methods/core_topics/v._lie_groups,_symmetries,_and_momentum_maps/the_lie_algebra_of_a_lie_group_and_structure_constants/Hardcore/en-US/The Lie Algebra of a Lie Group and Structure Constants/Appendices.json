We proceed with the solution in several steps.\n\nFirst, we derive the condition that characterizes the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\mathbb{R})$ as a subspace of the space of all real $2 \\times 2$ matrices, $M_{2}(\\mathbb{R})$. The Lie group is $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$, the set of $2 \\times 2$ real matrices with determinant equal to $1$.

The elements of this tangent space, denoted by $X$, are the tangent vectors to curves in the group that pass through the identity. Let $A(t)$ be such a curve, representing a one-parameter subgroup, with $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ being the parameter. We have $A(0) = I$, and the tangent vector at the identity is $X = \\frac{d A(t)}{dt}\\big|_{t=0}$.\n\nFor any $t$, the matrix $A(t)$ is in $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$, which means its determinant is constant and equal to $1$:\n$$ \\det(A(t)) = 1 $$\nWe differentiate this condition with respect to $t$ and evaluate at $t=0$. The derivative of a constant is zero, so:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\det(A(t))\\bigg|_{t=0} = 0 $$\nTo evaluate the left-hand side, we use Jacobi's formula for the derivative of the determinant of a matrix $A(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\det(A(t)) = \\det(A(t)) \\,\\mathrm{tr}\\left(A(t)^{-1} \\frac{dA(t)}{dt}\\right) $$\nNow, we evaluate this expression at $t=0$.

We adopt the ordered basis $(X_1, X_2, X_3) = (H, E, F)$.\n\nThe first required constant is $c^{H}_{E F}$. This is the coefficient of $H$ in the expansion of $[E,F]$.

Our computed relation is $[H,F] = -2F$, which can be written as:\n$$ [H, F] = 0 \\cdot H + 0 \\cdot E + (-2) \\cdot F $$\nBy comparison, we find $c^{F}_{H F} = -2$.\n\nThe ordered triple of a specified structure constant is therefore $(c^{H}_{E F}, c^{E}_{H E}, c^{F}_{H F}) = (1, 2, -2)$.

This implies $c_{12}^{1}=0$, $c_{12}^{2}=0$, and $c_{12}^{3}=1$.\n- $[X_{2}, X_{3}] = \\mathbf{0} = 0 \\cdot X_{1} + 0 \\cdot X_{2} + 0 \\cdot X_{3}$. This implies $c_{23}^{1}=0$, $c_{23}^{2}=0$, and $c_{23}^{3}=0$.\n- $[X_{3}, X_{1}] = \\mathbf{0} = 0 \\cdot X_{1} + 0 \\cdot X_{2} + 0 \\cdot X_{3}$. This implies $c_{31}^{1}=0$, $c_{31}^{2}=0$, and $c_{31}^{3}=0$.\n\nThe problem requests the ordered triple $(c_{12}^{3}, c_{23}^{1}, c_{31}^{2})$. Based on the above:\n- $c_{12}^{3} = 1$\n- $c_{23}^{1} = 0$\n- $c_{31}^{2} = 0$\n\n**Step 4: Determination of the Center of $\\mathfrak{h}_{3}$**\n\nThe center of a Lie algebra, $Z(\\mathfrak{g})$, is the set of elements that commute with all other elements in the algebra. Let $Z = aX_{1} + bX_{2} + cX_{3}$ be an arbitrary element in the center of $\\mathfrak{h}_{3}$, where $a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{R}$. For $Z$ to be in the center, we must have $[Z, Y]=0$ for all $Y \\in \\mathfrak{h}_{3}$. It suffices to test this condition against the basis vectors.\n\n1.  $[Z, X_{1}] = 0$:\n    $$\n    [aX_{1} + bX_{2} + cX_{3}, X_{1}] = a[X_{1},X_{1}] + b[X_{2},X_{1}] + c[X_{3},X_{1}] = b(-[X_{1},X_{2}]) = -bX_{3} = 0\n    $$\n    Since $X_{3}$ is a non-zero basis vector, this implies $b = 0$.\n\n2.  $[Z, X_{2}] = 0$:\n    $$\n    [aX_{1} + bX_{2} + cX_{3}, X_{2}] = a[X_{1},X_{2}] + b[X_{2},X_{2}] + c[X_{3},X_{2}] = aX_{3} = 0\n    $$\n    Since $X_{3}$ is non-zero, this implies $a = 0$.\n\n3.  $[Z, X_{3}] = 0$:\n    $$\n    [aX_{1} + bX_{2} + cX_{3}, X_{3}] = a[X_{1},X_{3}] + b[X_{2},X_{3}] + c[X_{3},X_{3}] = a(\\mathbf{0}) + b(\\mathbf{0}) + c(\\mathbf{0}) = \\mathbf{0}\n    $$\n    This provides no additional constraint on the coefficients.\n\nThe conditions $a=0$ and $b=0$ mean that any element $Z$ in the center must be of the form $Z = cX_{3}$ for some $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Thus, the center of the Heisenberg algebra $\\mathfrak{h}_{3}$ is the one-dimensional subspace spanned by $X_{3}$:\n$$\nZ(\\mathfrak{h}_{3}) = \\mathrm{span}\\{X_{3}\\}\n$$\nThis confirms that $X_{3}$ commutes with all elements of $\\mathfrak{h}_{3}$.\n\nThe required quantities for the final answer are $c_{12}^{3}=1$, $c_{23}^{1}=0$, and $c_{31}^{2}=0$. The ordered triple is $(1,0,0)$.",
