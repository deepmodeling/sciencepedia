            "problem": "Let $G$ be the General Linear group (GL) $G=\\mathrm{GL}(n,\\mathbb{R})$, viewed as a Lie group and as an open submanifold of the vector space of real $n\\times n$ matrices. Let $L_{g}:G\\to G$ denote left translation by $g\\in G$, defined by $L_{g}(h)=gh$, and let $(L_{g})_{*}:T_{e}G\\to T_{g}G$ denote its differential at the identity element $e$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for an explicit expression for a left-invariant vector field $X_{A}$ on the Lie group $G = \\mathrm{GL}(n,\\mathbb{R})$ at an element $g \\in G$. The vector field is generated by an element $A$ of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{gl}(n,\\mathbb{R})$. The derivation must be based on first principles, using the provided definitions.\n\nFirst, we establish the setting. The general linear group $G = \\mathrm{GL}(n,\\mathbb{R})$ is the set of all invertible $n \\times n$ real matrices. It is an open submanifold of the vector space $M(n,\\mathbb{R})$ of all $n \\times n$ real matrices, since the determinant function $\\det: M(n,\\mathbb{R}) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is continuous, and $G = \\det^{-1}(\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\})$, the pre-image of an open set. Because $G$ is an open subset of a Euclidean space (namely $M(n,\\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$), the tangent space $T_pG$ at any point $p \\in G$ can be canonically identified with the vector space $M(n,\\mathbb{R})$ itself. The identity element of the group $G$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix, which we denote by $e$. The Lie algebra is the tangent space at the identity, $\\mathfrak{gl}(n,\\mathbb{R}) = T_eG$, which is thus identified with $M(n,\\mathbb{R})$.\n\nA tangent vector in $T_pG$ can be represented as the velocity vector of a smooth curve in $G$. That is, a vector $V \\in T_pG$ corresponds to the derivative $\\gamma'(0)$ of a smooth curve $\\gamma: (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\to G$ such that $\\gamma(0) = p$ and $\\gamma'(0) = V$. The derivative is computed in the ambient space $M(n,\\mathbb{R})$.\n\nThe problem concerns a specific vector $A \\in \\mathfrak{gl}(n,\\mathbb{R}) = T_eG$. To work with this vector, we must first represent it by a suitable curve. Let $\\alpha(t)$ be a smooth curve in $G$ defined on an interval containing $0$ such that $\\alpha(0) = e$ and $\\alpha'(0) = A$. A straightforward choice for such a curve, leveraging the vector space structure of the ambient space, is $\\alpha(t) = e + tA$. Let's verify this curve:\n1.  At $t=0$, we have $\\alpha(0) = e + 0 \\cdot A = e$. The curve passes through the identity element at $t=0$.\n2.  The derivative with respect to $t$ is $\\alpha'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(e + tA) = A$. Thus, the velocity at $t=0$ is $\\alpha'(0) = A$.\nThis curve is guaranteed to be in $G = \\mathrm{GL}(n,\\mathbb{R})$ for $t$ in some open interval $(-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$ around $0$, because $\\det(\\alpha(t)) = \\det(e+tA)$ is a polynomial in $t$, and since $\\det(\\alpha(0)) = \\det(e) = 1 \\neq 0$, continuity implies that $\\det(\\alpha(t)) \\neq 0$ for $t$ sufficiently close to $0$.\n\nThe left-invariant vector field $X_A$ at a point $g \\in G$ is defined by $X_A(g) = (L_g)_*A$. Here, $L_g: G \\to G$ is the left-translation map $L_g(h) = gh$, and $(L_g)_*: T_eG \\to T_gG$ is its differential (or pushforward) at the identity $e$.\n\nThe pushforward of a tangent vector is computed by applying the map to the curve representing the vector and then taking the derivative of the resulting curve. The tangent vector $A$ at $e$ is represented by the curve $\\alpha(t)$. The pushforward $(L_g)_*A$ is therefore the velocity vector at $t=0$ of the transformed curve, $\\beta(t) = L_g(\\alpha(t))$.\n\nLet's compute this new curve $\\beta(t)$:\n$$ \\beta(t) = L_g(\\alpha(t)) = g \\cdot \\alpha(t) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\alpha(t)$, we get:\n$$ \\beta(t) = g(e + tA) $$\nUsing the distributive property of matrix multiplication, we have:\n$$ \\beta(t) = ge + g(tA) = g + t(gA) $$\nThis new curve $\\beta(t)$ is a path in $G$ that starts at $\\beta(0) = g + 0 \\cdot (gA) = g$. The tangent vector $X_A(g)$ is the velocity of this curve at $t=0$, which is $\\beta'(0)$.\n\nWe now differentiate $\\beta(t)$ with respect to $t$. Since $g$ and $A$ are constant matrices, the product $gA$ is also a constant matrix with respect to $t$.\n$$ \\beta'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(g + t(gA)) = 0 + 1 \\cdot (gA) = gA $$\nThe derivative is constant for all $t$. To find the tangent vector at $g$, we evaluate this derivative at $t=0$:\n$$ X_A(g) = \\beta'(0) = gA $$\nThis result, $gA$, is an $n \\times n$ matrix, which is consistent with our identification of the tangent space $T_gG$ with the space of all $n \\times n$ matrices $M(n,\\mathbb{R})$. Thus, the explicit expression for the left-invariant vector field $X_A$ at the point $g$ is the matrix product of $g$ and $A$.",

It is a standard exercise in the theory of Lie groups and their associated Lie algebras, specifically focusing on the relationship between Lie algebra elements and the integral curves of their corresponding left-invariant vector fields.

Here, $L_g: G \\to G$ is the left translation map $h \\mapsto gh$, and $(L_g)_*$ is its differential (pushforward) at the identity $e$. For a matrix Lie group, this relationship simplifies to matrix multiplication: $(X^L)_g = gX$.\n\nConsequently, the differential equation that defines the integral curve $g_k(t)$ for the vector field $X_k^L$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}g_k(t) = (X_k^L)_{g_k(t)} = g_k(t) X_k\n$$\nThis is a system of linear, first-order ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients (the matrix $X_k$ is constant). Given the initial condition $g_k(0) = g_0$, the unique solution is given by:\n$$\ng_k(t) = g_0 \\exp(tX_k)\n$$\nwhere $\\exp(\\cdot)$ denotes the matrix exponential.
