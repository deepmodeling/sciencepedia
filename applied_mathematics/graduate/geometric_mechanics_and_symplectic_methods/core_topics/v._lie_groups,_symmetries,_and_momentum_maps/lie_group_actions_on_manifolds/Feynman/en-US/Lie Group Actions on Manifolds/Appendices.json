The computation must start from the provided definitions.\n\nThe definition of $\\mathrm{ad}_{\\xi}(\\eta)$ is given by the derivative of the group adjoint action along a one-parameter subgroup:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ad}_{\\xi}(\\eta) = \\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} \\mathrm{Ad}_{\\exp(t \\xi)}(\\eta)\n$$\nwhere $\\xi, \\eta$ are elements of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$. Since $G$ is a matrix Lie group, its Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a vector subspace of the space of all $n \\times n$ real matrices, $\\mathrm{M}(n,\\mathbb{R})$.

Applying this property, we have $(\\exp(t\\xi))^{-1} = \\exp(-t\\xi)$. The expression becomes:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ad}_{\\xi}(\\eta) = \\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} \\left( \\exp(t\\xi) \\eta \\exp(-t\\xi) \\right)\n$$\nWe need to differentiate the matrix-valued function $F(t) = \\exp(t\\xi) \\eta \\exp(-t\\xi)$ with respect to the scalar variable $t$. We can apply the product rule for differentiation of matrices. For a product of three matrix-valued functions $A(t)$, $B(t)$, and $C(t)$, the product rule is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(A(t)B(t)C(t)) = \\left(\\frac{d}{dt}A(t)\\right)B(t)C(t) + A(t)\\left(\\frac{d}{dt}B(t)\\right)C(t) + A(t)B(t)\\left(\\frac{d}{dt}C(t)\\right)\n$$\nIn our case, we have $A(t) = \\exp(t\\xi)$, $B(t) = \\eta$, and $C(t) = \\exp(-t\\xi)$. The matrix $\\eta$ is constant with respect to $t$, so $\\frac{d}{dt}B(t) = 0$.\n\nNext, we compute the derivatives of $A(t)$ and $C(t)$. The derivative of the matrix exponential function is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\exp(tX) = X \\exp(tX) = \\exp(tX) X\n$$\nfor a constant matrix $X$.\nApplying this rule to $A(t) = \\exp(t\\xi)$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}A(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\exp(t\\xi) = \\xi \\exp(t\\xi)\n$$\nApplying the same rule combined with the chain rule to $C(t) = \\exp(-t\\xi)$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}C(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\exp(-t\\xi) = -\\xi \\exp(-t\\xi)\n$$\nNow, we substitute these derivatives into the product rule expression:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} F(t) = (\\xi \\exp(t\\xi)) \\eta \\exp(-t\\xi) + \\exp(t\\xi) (0) \\exp(-t\\xi) + \\exp(t\\xi) \\eta (-\\xi \\exp(-t\\xi))\n$$\nSimplifying this expression gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} F(t) = \\xi \\exp(t\\xi) \\eta \\exp(-t\\xi) - \\exp(t\\xi) \\eta \\xi \\exp(-t\\xi)\n$$\nTo find $\\mathrm{ad}_{\\xi}(\\eta)$, we must evaluate this derivative at $t=0$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ad}_{\\xi}(\\eta) = \\left. \\left( \\xi \\exp(t\\xi) \\eta \\exp(-t\\xi) - \\exp(t\\xi) \\eta \\xi \\exp(-t\\xi) \\right) \\right|_{t=0}\n$$\nWe use the property that $\\exp(0) = I$, where $I$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix.

            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard problem in the theory of Lie group actions on manifolds. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for an analysis of the smooth action of the Lie group $G = \\mathrm{SO}(3)$ on the manifold $M = S^{2}$. The group $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ is the group of $3 \\times 3$ real orthogonal matrices with determinant $+1$, representing rotations in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. The manifold $S^{2}$ is the unit sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, defined as $S^2 = \\{p \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid \\|p\\|^2 = 1\\}$. The action of an element $g \\in G$ on a point $p \\in M$ is given by matrix-vector multiplication, $g \\cdot p = gp$.\n\nFirst, we establish that the action is transitive. This means that for any two points $p_1, p_2 \\in S^2$, there exists a rotation $g \\in \\mathrm{SO}(3)$ such that $g p_1 = p_2$. Since $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ acts by rotations and both $p_1$ and $p_2$ are unit vectors, such a rotation always exists. For instance, a rotation in the plane spanned by $p_1$ and $p_2$ can map $p_1$ to $p_2$. If $p_1$ and $p_2$ are not collinear, this plane is unique. If $p_2 = -p_1$, a rotation by $\\pi$ about any axis orthogonal to $p_1$ will suffice. Since the action is transitive, there is only one orbit, which is the entire sphere $S^2$.\n\n1. Determine the stabilizer subgroup $G_{p}$ and its Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}_{p}$.\n\nTo determine the stabilizer for a generic point $p$, we can choose a specific point without loss of generality, due to the transitivity of the action. Let us choose the \"north pole\", $p = e_3 = (0, 0, 1)^T$. The stabilizer $G_p$ is the set of all $g \\in \\mathrm{SO}(3)$ such that $g p = p$.\n$$\nG_p = \\{ g \\in \\mathrm{SO}(3) \\mid g e_3 = e_3 \\}\n$$\nLet $g$ be a $3 \\times 3$ matrix. The condition $g e_3 = e_3$ implies that the third column of $g$ is $(0, 0, 1)^T$. Since $g \\in \\mathrm{SO}(3)$, its columns must form an orthonormal basis. This requires the first two columns to be orthogonal to the third column, so their third components must be $0$. Furthermore, the first two columns must form an orthonormal basis of the $xy$-plane. This means the upper-left $2 \\times 2$ submatrix of $g$ must be an element of the orthogonal group $\\mathrm{O}(2)$. The matrix $g$ has the form:\n$$\ng = \\begin{pmatrix} A & \\begin{matrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{matrix} \\\\ \\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 \\end{matrix} & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\text{where } A \\in \\mathrm{O}(2)\n$$\nFor $g$ to be in $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$, we must have $\\det(g) = 1$. The determinant of $g$ is equal to the determinant of the block matrix $A$, i.e., $\\det(g) = \\det(A)$. Thus, we require $\\det(A) = 1$, which means $A \\in \\mathrm{SO}(2)$. Matrices in $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ are rotations in the plane, parametrized by an angle $\\theta$:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSo, the stabilizer $G_p$ is the subgroup of rotations about the $z$-axis. This subgroup is isomorphic to $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$, which is topologically a circle, $S^1$.\n$$\nG_p \\cong \\mathrm{SO}(2)\n$$\nThe Lie algebra of the stabilizer, $\\mathfrak{g}_p$, is the set of all $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$ such that the flow generated by $\\xi$, $\\exp(t\\xi)$, lies in $G_p$. This is equivalent to the condition that $\\xi p = 0$. The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$ consists of all $3 \\times 3$ skew-symmetric matrices. Any such matrix $\\xi$ can be identified with a vector $\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ via the hat map, $\\xi = \\hat{\\omega}$, such that $\\xi v = \\omega \\times v$ for any $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$.\nSo, the condition $\\xi p = 0$ becomes $\\omega \\times p = 0$. For our chosen $p=e_3$, this is $\\omega \\times e_3 = 0$.\nIf $\\omega = (\\omega_1, \\omega_2, \\omega_3)^T$, then $\\omega \\times e_3 = (\\omega_2, -\\omega_1, 0)^T$. For this to be the zero vector, we must have $\\omega_1 = 0$ and $\\omega_2 = 0$. Thus, $\\omega$ must be of the form $(0, 0, \\omega_3)^T$, which is a vector parallel to $p=e_3$.\nUnder the standard identification of $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$ with $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}_p$ is the one-dimensional subspace spanned by the vector $p$.\n$$\n\\mathfrak{g}_p = \\text{span}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\longleftrightarrow \\text{span}_{\\mathbb{R}}(e_3)\n$$\nNow, consider the antipodal point $-p = -e_3 = (0, 0, -1)^T$. The stabilizer $G_{-p}$ is the set of $g \\in \\mathrm{SO}(3)$ such that $g(-p) = -p$. Since $g$ is a linear transformation, this is equivalent to $g p = p$. Therefore, the stabilizer of the antipodal point is the same group:\n$$\nG_{-p} = G_p \\cong \\mathrm{SO}(2)\n$$\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}_{-p}$ is the set of $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$ such that $\\xi(-p) = 0$, which is again equivalent to $\\xi p = 0$. Thus, the Lie algebra is also the same:\n$$\n\\mathfrak{g}_{-p} = \\mathfrak{g}_p \\longleftrightarrow \\text{span}_{\\mathbb{R}}(e_3)\n$$\n\n2. Classify the orbit types.\n\nAs established earlier, the action of $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ on $S^2$ is transitive. This means there is only one orbit: the entire sphere $S^2$. The stabilizer of any point $q \\in S^2$ is related to the stabilizer of our reference point $p=e_3$ by conjugation. If $q = h p$ for some $h \\in \\mathrm{SO}(3)$, then the stabilizer of $q$ is $G_q = h G_p h^{-1}$. Since all points are in the same orbit, all stabilizers are conjugate to each other.\nThe stabilizer $G_p$ for $p=e_3$ is the group of rotations about the $z$-axis. The stabilizer $G_q$ for an arbitrary $q \\in S^2$ is the group of rotations about the axis defined by the vector $q$. All these subgroups are isomorphic to $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$.\nSince all stabilizers belong to the same conjugacy class (the class of subgroups isomorphic to $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$), there is only one isotropy type for this action.\nAn action is called *regular* if all its stabilizers are conjugate. In this case, the action is regular. An orbit is called a *principal orbit* if its isotropy group is minimal (in a certain lattice sense) and belongs to a conjugacy class of stabilizers that is stable in a neighborhood. Since there is only one isotropy type, the single orbit is a principal orbit.\nThere are no *singular orbits* (which would have stabilizers of a larger dimension than the principal ones) or *exceptional orbits* (which would have stabilizers of the same dimension but in a different conjugacy class). In this action, every point on the sphere has a stabilizer of the same dimension and from the same conjugacy class, so only the principal orbit type exists.\n\n3. Compute the dimensions of the stabilizers and the orbit.\n\nThe dimension of a Lie group is the dimension of its Lie algebra.\nThe Lie group $G = \\mathrm{SO}(3)$ has dimension $3$. Its Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$ is the space of $3 \\times 3$ skew-symmetric matrices, which is a $3$-dimensional vector space.\nThe stabilizer subgroup $G_p$, for any $p \\in S^2$, is isomorphic to $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$. The group $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ is the circle group $S^1$, which is a $1$-dimensional Lie group. Thus, its dimension is $1$.\n$$\n\\dim(G_p) = 1\n$$\nThe stabilizer of the antipodal point, $G_{-p}$, is the same group as $G_p$. Therefore, its dimension is also $1$.\n$$\n\\dim(G_{-p}) = 1\n$$\nThe dimension of the orbit $G \\cdot p$ can be computed using the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem for Lie group actions, which states that $\\dim(G \\cdot p) = \\dim(G) - \\dim(G_p)$.\n$$\n\\dim(G \\cdot p) = \\dim(G) - \\dim(G_p)\n$$\nSubstituting the known dimensions:\n$$\n\\dim(G \\cdot p) = 3 - 1 = 2\n$$\nThis result is consistent with our finding that the orbit is the entire sphere $S^2$, which is a $2$-dimensional manifold.\n\nThe final requested values are $\\dim(G_p)$, $\\dim(G_{-p})$, and $\\dim(G \\cdot p)$. Based on the analysis above, these are $1$, $1$, and $2$, respectively.",

The momentum map is a Poisson homomorphism, which means $\\{\\langle J, \\xi_1 \\rangle, \\langle J, \\xi_2 \\rangle\\} = \\langle J, [\\xi_1, \\xi_2] \\rangle$. We compute the Lie brackets of our basis elements in $\\mathfrak{se}(2)$:\n- $[\\xi_{P_x}, \\xi_{P_y}] = [ (e_1, 0), (e_2, 0) ] = (0 \\cdot e_2 - 0 \\cdot e_1, 0) = 0$.\nThus, $\\{P_x, P_y\\} = \\langle J, 0 \\rangle = 0$, which matches our calculation.\n- $[\\xi_L, \\xi_{P_x}] = [ (0, \\Omega_0), (e_1, 0) ] = (\\Omega_0 e_1 - 0, 0) = (\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, 0) = (\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, 0) = (e_2, 0) = \\xi_{P_y}$.\nThus, $\\{L, P_x\\} = \\langle J, \\xi_{P_y} \\rangle = P_y$, which matches.\n- $[\\xi_L, \\xi_{P_y}] = [ (0, \\Omega_0), (e_2, 0) ] = (\\Omega_0 e_2 - 0, 0) = (\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, 0) = (\\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, 0) = (-e_1, 0) = -\\xi_{P_x}$.\nThus, $\\{L, P_y\\} = \\langle J, -\\xi_{P_x} \\rangle = -P_x$, which also matches.\n\nThe calculations are verified. The final result is the ordered triple of the computed Poisson brackets.\n$$\n(\\{P_x, P_y\\}, \\{L, P_x\\}, \\{L, P_y\\}) = (0, P_y, -P_x)\n$$",
