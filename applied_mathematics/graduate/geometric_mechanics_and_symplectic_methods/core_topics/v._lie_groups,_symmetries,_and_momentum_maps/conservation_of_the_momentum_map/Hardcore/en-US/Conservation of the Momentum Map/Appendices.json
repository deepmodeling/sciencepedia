The phase space is the cotangent bundle $T^{*}S^{2}_{R}$ equipped with the canonical symplectic form $\\omega_{\\mathrm{can}}$. The special orthogonal group $SO(3)$ acts on $S^{2}_{R}$ by rotations, and this action lifts to a symplectic action on $T^{*}S^{2}_{R}$ by cotangent lift.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as sound, well-posed, and falls squarely within the domain of geometric mechanics. We proceed with the derivation as requested.\n\nThe objective is to find the explicit expression for the momentum map $J: T^{*}S^{2}_{R} \\to \\mathfrak{so}(3)^{*}$ associated with the symplectic action of $SO(3)$ on the phase space $T^{*}S^{2}_{R}$. We are given the defining relation for $J$. We shall use the more direct, equivalent form provided in the problem statement:\n$$\n\\langle J(q,p), \\xi \\rangle = p\\big(\\xi_{S^{2}_{R}}(q)\\big)\n$$\nfor any point $(q,p) \\in T^{*}S^{2}_{R}$ and any Lie algebra element $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$. In this expression, $q \\in S^{2}_{R}$, $p$ is a covector in the cotangent space $T_q^*S^{2}_{R}$, and $\\xi_{S^{2}_{R}}(q)$ is the infinitesimal generator vector field on $S^{2}_{R}$ corresponding to $\\xi$.\n\nFirst, we must make the given identifications precise.\n$1$. The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$ of the special orthogonal group $SO(3)$ is the space of $3 \\times 3$ skew-symmetric matrices. We identify $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$ with $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ via the map $\\boldsymbol{v} \\mapsto \\hat{\\boldsymbol{v}}$, where $\\boldsymbol{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ and the matrix $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{v}}$ acts on any vector $\\boldsymbol{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ as $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{v}}\\boldsymbol{x} = \\boldsymbol{v} \\times \\boldsymbol{x}$. Under this isomorphism, we will denote the Lie algebra element corresponding to a vector $\\boldsymbol{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ as $\\xi_{\\boldsymbol{v}}$.\n\n$2$. The dual space $\\mathfrak{so}(3)^*$ is identified with $\\mathbb{R}^3$ using the standard Euclidean inner product (dot product). If $J(q,p) \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)^*$ is represented by the vector $\\mathbf{J} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, and $\\xi_{\\boldsymbol{v}} \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$ is represented by $\\boldsymbol{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, then the pairing $\\langle J(q,p), \\xi_{\\boldsymbol{v}} \\rangle$ is given by the dot product $\\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}$.\n\n$3$. The cotangent space $T_q^*S^{2}_{R}$ is identified with the tangent space $T_qS^{2}_{R}$ using the Riemannian metric $g_q$. This metric is induced by the Euclidean inner product on the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^3$. For a covector $p \\in T_q^*S^{2}_{R}$, the corresponding tangent vector, which the problem statement allows us to denote by the same symbol $p$, is the unique vector in $T_qS^{2}_{R}$ such that for any other tangent vector $w \\in T_qS^{2}_{R}$, the action of the covector $p$ on $w$ is given by the metric: $p(w) = g_q(p, w)$. Since the metric is the restriction of the standard dot product, this simplifies to $p(w) = p \\cdot w$. Note that as $p$ and $q$ are now vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and $p \\in T_qS^{2}_{R}$, they are orthogonal, i.e., $p \\cdot q = 0$.\n\nWith these identifications, our task is to find the vector $\\mathbf{J}(q,p) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. We begin by computing the infinitesimal generator $\\xi_{S^{2}_{R}}(q)$. The action of $G=SO(3)$ on $S^{2}_{R}$ is given by $\\Phi: G \\times S^{2}_{R} \\to S^{2}_{R}$, where $\\Phi(A, q) = Aq$ for $A \\in SO(3)$ and $q \\in S^{2}_{R} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$. The infinitesimal generator corresponding to $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\xi_{S^{2}_{R}}(q) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\Phi(\\exp(t\\xi), q) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} (\\exp(t\\xi) q)\n$$\nUsing the first-order approximation of the matrix exponential, $\\exp(t\\xi) \\approx I + t\\xi$, where $I$ is the identity matrix, we get:\n$$\n\\xi_{S^{2}_{R}}(q) = (\\xi) q\n$$\nUsing the identification $\\xi \\leftrightarrow \\boldsymbol{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, where $\\xi q = \\boldsymbol{v} \\times q$, we have:\n$$\n\\xi_{S^{2}_{R}}(q) = \\boldsymbol{v} \\times q\n$$\nThis vector is tangent to the sphere at $q$, as required, since $(\\boldsymbol{v} \\times q) \\cdot q = 0$.\n\nNow we substitute this into the defining equation for the momentum map. Let $\\mathbf{J}$ be the vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ representing $J(q,p)$, and $\\boldsymbol{v}$ be the vector for $\\xi$. The left-hand side of the definition becomes $\\langle J(q,p), \\xi \\rangle = \\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}$. The right-hand side is $p(\\xi_{S^{2}_{R}}(q))$. Using the identification between $T_q^*S^{2}_{R}$ and $T_qS^{2}_{R}$, this becomes the dot product of the vector $p \\in T_qS_R^2$ with the vector $\\xi_{S^{2}_{R}}(q)$:\n$$\np(\\xi_{S^{2}_{R}}(q)) = p \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{v} \\times q)\n$$\nEquating the two sides, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v} = p \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{v} \\times q)\n$$\nWe use the scalar triple product identity $a \\cdot (b \\times c) = (a \\times b) \\cdot c$. The problem has $p \\cdot (v \\times q)$, which is equal to $v \\cdot (q \\times p)$. Applying this to the right-hand side gives:\n$$\np \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{v} \\times q) = (q \\times p) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}\n$$\nSo, our equation becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v} = (q \\times p) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}\n$$\nThis relation must hold for all vectors $\\boldsymbol{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. This implies that the vectors themselves must be equal:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = q \\times p\n$$\nThis is the explicit expression for the momentum map, identified as a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. This is the classical angular momentum of the particle. The problem asks for $J(q,p)$, which is this vector.\n\nThe problem states that the momentum map is conserved. This is a consequence of Noether's theorem. The Hamiltonian is $H(q,p)=\\frac{1}{2m}\\,g^{-1}_{q}(p,p)+V(q)$. Using our identifications, $g^{-1}_{q}(p,p)$ is the squared norm of the tangent vector $p$, i.e., $\\|p\\|^2$. So, $H = \\frac{\\|p\\|^2}{2m} + V(q)$. The kinetic energy term is invariant under rotations ($SO(3)$ action) because rotations are isometries and preserve the norm of vectors. The potential $V(q)$ is explicitly given to be rotationally invariant. Thus, the total Hamiltonian $H$ is invariant under the $SO(3)$ action. By Noether's theorem, the associated momentum map $J(q,p)$ is a conserved quantity along the trajectories of the system.\n\nFinally, we describe the coadjoint orbit in $\\mathfrak{so}(3)^*$ that contains a non-zero value of the momentum map, $J(q,p) = \\mathbf{J} = q \\times p \\neq \\mathbf{0}$. A coadjoint orbit is the set of points in $\\mathfrak{so}(3)^*$ generated by the coadjoint action of the group $SO(3)$. The coadjoint action of an element $A \\in SO(3)$ on an element $\\mu \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)^*$ is given by $(\\text{Ad}_A^*\\mu)(\\xi) = \\mu(\\text{Ad}_{A^{-1}}\\xi)$ for all $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$. Under the identifications $\\mathfrak{so}(3) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3$ and $\\mathfrak{so}(3)^* \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3$, the adjoint action $\\text{Ad}_A \\xi$ corresponds to the vector transformation $\\boldsymbol{v} \\mapsto A\\boldsymbol{v}$. Consequently, the coadjoint action on a vector $\\mathbf{J} \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)^*$ corresponds to the transformation $\\mathbf{J} \\mapsto A\\mathbf{J}$. The orbit of a point $\\mathbf{J}$ is the set $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbf{J}} = \\{A\\mathbf{J} \\mid A \\in SO(3)\\}$. For $\\mathbf{J} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$, this is the set of all vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with the same magnitude as $\\mathbf{J}$. Geometrically, this is a sphere centered at the origin of radius $\\|\\mathbf{J}\\|$. Therefore, the coadjoint orbit containing $J(q,p) = q \\times p$ is the sphere of radius $\\|q \\times p\\|$ in $\\mathfrak{so}(3)^* \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3$.",

It is not trivial, as it probes the subtle distinction between canonical and mechanical momentum and the nature of conservation laws in gauge theories. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Conservation of the Canonical Momentum Map $J_{0}$**\n\nThe system is described on the phase space $T^{*}Q = T^{*}\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with coordinates $(x,y,p_{x},p_{y})$. The dynamics are governed by the Hamiltonian:\n$$\nH(x,y,p_{x},p_{y})=\\frac{1}{2m}\\left[(p_{x}-q\\,A_{x}(x,y))^{2}+(p_{y}-q\\,A_{y}(x,y))^{2}\\right]\n$$\nThe vector potential is given by $A = \\nabla\\chi$ with $\\chi(x,y) = \\gamma\\,x\\,y$. The components are $A_{x}(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial\\chi}{\\partial x} = \\gamma\\,y$ and $A_{y}(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial\\chi}{\\partial y} = \\gamma\\,x$. Substituting these into the Hamiltonian gives:\n$$\nH(x,y,p_{x},p_{y})=\\frac{1}{2m}\\left[(p_{x}-q\\,\\gamma\\,y)^{2}+(p_{y}-q\\,\\gamma\\,x)^{2}\\right]\n$$\nThe time evolution of any function $f$ on the phase space is given by its Poisson bracket with the Hamiltonian, $\\dot{f} = \\{f, H\\}$. For the canonical momenta $p_{x}$ and $p_{y}$, Hamilton's equations are:\n$$\n\\dot{p}_{x} = \\{p_{x}, H\\} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{p}_{y} = \\{p_{y}, H\\} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y}\n$$\nWe compute the required partial derivatives of $H$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{1}{2m}(p_{y}-q\\,\\gamma\\,x)^{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2m} \\cdot 2(p_{y}-q\\,\\gamma\\,x) \\cdot (-q\\,\\gamma) = -\\frac{q\\,\\gamma}{m}(p_{y}-q\\,\\gamma\\,x)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{1}{2m}(p_{x}-q\\,\\gamma\\,y)^{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2m} \\cdot 2(p_{x}-q\\,\\gamma\\,y) \\cdot (-q\\,\\gamma) = -\\frac{q\\,\\gamma}{m}(p_{x}-q\\,\\gamma\\,y)\n$$\nSubstituting these back into Hamilton's equations yields the time derivatives of the canonical momenta:\n$$\n\\dot{p}_{x} = - \\left(-\\frac{q\\,\\gamma}{m}(p_{y}-q\\,\\gamma\\,x)\\right) = \\frac{q\\,\\gamma}{m}(p_{y}-q\\,\\gamma\\,x)\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{p}_{y} = - \\left(-\\frac{q\\,\\gamma}{m}(p_{x}-q\\,\\gamma\\,y)\\right) = \\frac{q\\,\\gamma}{m}(p_{x}-q\\,\\gamma\\,y)\n$$\nSince the problem specifies that $\\gamma \\neq 0$ and we assume a non-trivial charge $q \\neq 0$, the time derivatives $\\dot{p}_{x}$ and $\\dot{p}_{y}$ are generally non-zero. The canonical momentum components $p_x$ and $p_y$ are not conserved. The canonical momentum map $J_{0}$, whose components are $p_x$ and $p_y$ (when paired with basis vectors), is therefore not conserved along the Hamiltonian flow. This is expected, as the Hamiltonian explicitly depends on the coordinates $x$ and $y$ through the vector potential $A(x,y)$, and thus is not invariant under the specified translation action on phase space.\n\n**Part 2: The Conserved, Gauge-Invariant Momentum Map**\n\nIn the presence of a vector potential, the conserved quantity associated with translation symmetry is not the canonical momentum $\\mathbf{p}$, but the gauge-invariant mechanical (or kinetic) momentum, defined as $\\boldsymbol{\\pi} = \\mathbf{p} - q\\mathbf{A}$. The components of the mechanical momentum vector are:\n$$\n\\pi_{x} = p_{x} - q\\,A_{x}(x,y) = p_{x} - q\\,\\gamma\\,y\n$$\n$$\n\\pi_{y} = p_{y} - q\\,A_{y}(x,y) = p_{y} - q\\,\\gamma\\,x\n$$\nThis quantity is gauge-invariant because under a gauge transformation $A \\rightarrow A' = A + \\nabla\\lambda$, the canonical momentum transforms as $p \\rightarrow p' = p + q\\,\\nabla\\lambda$, such that $\\pi' = p' - q\\,A' = (p + q\\,\\nabla\\lambda) - q(A + \\nabla\\lambda) = p - qA = \\pi$.\n\nTo show that $\\boldsymbol{\\pi} = (\\pi_{x}, \\pi_{y})$ is conserved, we must show that its components have zero time derivatives along the flow of $H$. We compute $\\dot{\\pi}_{x}$ and $\\dot{\\pi}_{y}$ using the chain rule and Hamilton's equations for $\\dot{x}$ and $\\dot{y}$.\nThe time derivative of $\\pi_{x}$ is:\n$$\n\\dot{\\pi}_{x} = \\frac{d}{dt}(p_{x} - q\\,\\gamma\\,y) = \\dot{p}_{x} - q\\,\\gamma\\,\\dot{y}\n$$\nWe need the expression for $\\dot{y}$, given by Hamilton's equation $\\dot{y} = \\{y, H\\} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_{y}}$:\n$$\n\\dot{y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{y}}\\left(\\frac{1}{2m}(p_{y}-q\\,\\gamma\\,x)^{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{m}(p_{y}-q\\,\\gamma\\,x)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\dot{p}_{x}$ and $\\dot{y}$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\pi}_{x} = \\frac{q\\,\\gamma}{m}(p_{y}-q\\,\\gamma\\,x) - q\\,\\gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{m}(p_{y}-q\\,\\gamma\\,x)\\right) = 0\n$$\nThus, $\\pi_{x}$ is a conserved quantity.\n\nSimilarly, the time derivative of $\\pi_{y}$ is:\n$$\n\\dot{\\pi}_{y} = \\frac{d}{dt}(p_{y} - q\\,\\gamma\\,x) = \\dot{p}_{y} - q\\,\\gamma\\,\\dot{x}\n$$\nWe need the expression for $\\dot{x}$, given by Hamilton's equation $\\dot{x} = \\{x, H\\} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_{x}}$:\n$$\n\\dot{x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{x}}\\left(\\frac{1}{2m}(p_{x}-q\\,\\gamma\\,y)^{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{m}(p_{x}-q\\,\\gamma\\,y)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\dot{p}_{y}$ and $\\dot{x}$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\pi}_{y} = \\frac{q\\,\\gamma}{m}(p_{x}-q\\,\\gamma\\,y) - q\\,\\gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{m}(p_{x}-q\\,\\gamma\\,y)\\right) = 0\n$$\nThus, $\\pi_{y}$ is also a conserved quantity.\n\nSince both components are conserved, the vector quantity $\\boldsymbol{\\pi} = (\\pi_x, \\pi_y)$ is the conserved momentum map associated with the spatial translation symmetry of this system. Its explicit expression is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\pi} = \\begin{pmatrix} p_{x} - q\\,\\gamma\\,y  p_{y} - q\\,\\gamma\\,x \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis result is consistent with Noether's theorem for Lagrangians that change by a total time derivative under a symmetry transformation, which is the case here for spatial translations.

The coordinates on the phase space are given by the left trivialization $T^*SO(3) \\cong SO(3) \\times \\mathfrak{so}(3)^*$, where a point is denoted $(g, \\mu)$.\n\nAn element of the phase space is a covector $\\alpha_g \\in T_g^*SO(3)$. The left trivialization identifies $\\alpha_g$ with an element $\\mu \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)^*$ via the pullback of the left translation map $L_g(k) = gk$. Specifically, $\\mu = (T_e L_g)^* \\alpha_g$. This identification implies that for any $\\eta \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$, the pairing is given by:\n$$\n\\langle \\mu, \\eta \\rangle = \\langle (T_e L_g)^* \\alpha_g, \\eta \\rangle = \\langle \\alpha_g, (T_e L_g)_* \\eta \\rangle\n$$\nThe tangent map $(T_e L_g)_*$ pushes forward a vector from the Lie algebra (the tangent space at the identity $e$) to the tangent space at $g$. For a matrix Lie group like $SO(3)$, this is simply $(T_e L_g)_* \\eta = g\\eta$. Thus:\n$$\n\\langle \\mu, \\eta \\rangle = \\langle \\alpha_g, g\\eta \\rangle\n$$\nThis equation links the body momentum $\\mu$ to the covector $\\alpha_g$ at the point $g$.\n\nThe momentum map $J_R$ is defined by the relation $\\mathbf{i}_{\\xi_{T^*SO(3)}}\\omega_{\\mathrm{can}}=\\mathrm{d}\\langle J_R,\\xi\\rangle$ for every $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$. A standard result in symplectic geometry is that for a cotangent lifted action, the component of the momentum map associated with $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$ is given by the function $\\langle J_R, \\xi \\rangle: T^*SO(3) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined as:\n$$\n\\langle J_R(\\alpha_g), \\xi \\rangle = \\langle \\alpha_g, \\xi_{SO(3)}(g) \\rangle\n$$\nwhere $\\xi_{SO(3)}(g)$ is the infinitesimal generator of the action on the configuration space $SO(3)$, evaluated at the point $g$.\n\nThe action is the right translation, $\\Psi_h(g) = R_h(g) = gh$. The infinitesimal generator for this action is:\n$$\n\\xi_{SO(3)}(g) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\Psi_{\\exp(t\\xi)}(g) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\bigg|_{t=0} g \\exp(t\\xi) = g\\xi\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the momentum map component:\n$$\n\\langle J_R(\\alpha_g), \\xi \\rangle = \\langle \\alpha_g, g\\xi \\rangle\n$$\nComparing this with our earlier result from the left trivialization, $\\langle \\mu, \\xi \\rangle = \\langle \\alpha_g, g\\xi \\rangle$, we see that for any $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$:\n$$\n\\langle J_R(g, \\mu), \\xi \\rangle = \\langle \\mu, \\xi \\rangle\n$$\nSince this holds for all $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$, we conclude that the momentum map is identical to the body momentum:\n$$\nJ_R(g, \\mu) = \\mu\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the derivation.\n\n**Part 2: Proof of Conservation and Final Value**\n\nWe are now given that the metric is bi-invariant, which implies that the inertia tensor is a scalar multiple of the identity, $\\mathbb{I} = \\lambda \\, \\mathrm{Id}$ for some constant $\\lambda  0$. The Hamiltonian is $H(g,\\mu)=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\langle \\mu,\\mathbb{I}^{-1}\\mu\\rangle$. The inner product on $\\mathfrak{so}(3)^*$ is induced by $\\mathbb{I}^{-1}$, so let us write this as $H(\\mu) = \\frac{1}{2} ||\\mu||_{\\mathbb{I}^{-1}}^2$. We are asked to prove that the function $t\\mapsto \\langle J_{R}(g(t),\\mu(t)),\\xi\\rangle$ is constant along any Hamiltonian trajectory $(g(t), \\mu(t))$. From Part 1, this is equivalent to proving that $t\\mapsto \\langle\\mu(t),\\xi\\rangle$ is constant for any fixed $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$.\n\nWe use the Lie-Poisson equations for the dynamics of the body angular momentum $\\mu \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)^*$. The equations of motion for a function $F(\\mu)$ on $\\mathfrak{so}(3)^*$ are given by $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}F}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\{F, H\\}_{LP}$, where $\\{ \\cdot, \\cdot \\}_{LP}$ is the Lie-Poisson bracket. For the specific case of a rigid body, the time evolution of $\\mu$ is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mu}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\mathrm{ad}_{\\Omega}^* \\mu\n$$\nwhere $\\Omega = \\mathbb{I}^{-1}\\mu \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$ is the body angular velocity. The operator $\\mathrm{ad}_{\\Omega}^*$ is the coadjoint action of $\\Omega$. By definition, for any $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$:\n$$\n\\langle \\mathrm{ad}_{\\Omega}^* \\mu, \\xi \\rangle = \\langle \\mu, [\\Omega, \\xi] \\rangle\n$$\nwhere $[\\cdot,\\cdot]$ is the Lie bracket on $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$.\n\nLet's compute the time derivative of the function in question, $F(t) = \\langle \\mu(t), \\xi \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\langle \\mu(t), \\xi \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mu}{\\mathrm{d}t}, \\xi \\right\\rangle = \\langle \\mathrm{ad}_{\\Omega}^* \\mu, \\xi \\rangle = \\langle \\mu, [\\Omega, \\xi] \\rangle\n$$\nThe problem states that the metric is bi-invariant, so $\\mathbb{I} = \\lambda \\mathrm{Id}$. This means the body angular velocity is $\\Omega = \\mathbb{I}^{-1}\\mu = \\lambda^{-1}\\mu$. Under the standard identification of $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$ and $\\mathfrak{so}(3)^*$, this means $\\mu$ and $\\Omega$ are parallel vectors.\nLet the pairing $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ be induced by an Ad-invariant inner product $(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ on $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$, such that $\\langle \\nu, X \\rangle = (\\kappa^{-1}(\\nu), X)$ for $\\nu \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)^*, X \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$, where $\\kappa$ is the isomorphism defined by the inner product. Then $\\mu = \\lambda \\kappa(\\Omega)$.\nThe expression becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\langle \\mu(t), \\xi \\rangle = \\langle \\lambda \\kappa(\\Omega), [\\Omega, \\xi] \\rangle = \\lambda (\\Omega, [\\Omega, \\xi])\n$$\nA fundamental property of an Ad-invariant inner product on a Lie algebra is that $(X, [Y,Z]) = ([X,Y], Z)$ for all $X,Y,Z$ in the algebra. Applying this property:\n$$\n\\lambda (\\Omega, [\\Omega, \\xi]) = \\lambda ([\\Omega, \\Omega], \\xi)\n$$\nSince the Lie bracket is antisymmetric, $[\\Omega, \\Omega] = 0$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\lambda ([\\Omega, \\Omega], \\xi) = \\lambda (0, \\xi) = 0\n$$\nWe have shown that for any fixed $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\langle \\mu(t),\\xi\\rangle = 0\n$$\nThis proves that the function $t \\mapsto \\langle \\mu(t), \\xi \\rangle$ is constant along any Hamiltonian trajectory. As this holds for any $\\xi$, it implies that the body angular momentum vector $\\mu(t)$ is constant in time. This is the well-known result for a free rigid body with a spherical inertia tensor (a bi-invariant metric).\n\nThe final question asks for the exact value of this time derivative. As established by the proof above, this value is zero.",
