## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg theorem, whose principles and mechanisms were detailed in the preceding chapter, is far more than an elegant statement about the image of a moment map. It is a foundational result that forges a profound and actionable link between the continuous world of [differential geometry](@entry_id:145818) and the discrete world of combinatorics. By establishing that the moment map image of a Hamiltonian torus action on a compact, connected symplectic manifold is a [convex polytope](@entry_id:1123046), the theorem opens the door to a rich dictionary translating complex geometric properties into tangible combinatorial data. This chapter explores the far-reaching consequences of this correspondence, demonstrating the theorem's utility in the classification of manifolds, the computation of [topological invariants](@entry_id:138526), the study of [integrable systems](@entry_id:144213), and the principles of geometric quantization. We will see how abstract geometric operations on manifolds find simple, intuitive counterparts as operations on their moment polytopes, revealing a deep structural coherence across disparate fields of mathematics and physics.

### Foundational Examples: Building the Polytopal Dictionary

To appreciate the power of the [convexity](@entry_id:138568) theorem, we begin with its application to some of the most fundamental examples in symplectic geometry. These cases provide the basic vocabulary for the geometry-to-combinatorics dictionary that the theorem enables.

The simplest non-trivial Hamiltonian torus action is that of the circle group $S^1$ rotating the $2$-sphere $S^2$ about an axis. The [moment map](@entry_id:157938) for this action projects the sphere onto this axis. As the Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg theorem predicts, the image is a compact, convex subset of $\mathbb{R}$, which is a closed interval—a one-dimensional [polytope](@entry_id:635803). The endpoints of this interval correspond to the images of the two fixed points of the action, the north and south poles. The length of this interval is not arbitrary; it is directly proportional to the total symplectic area of the sphere. For an area form $\omega$ with total area $A = \int_{S^2} \omega$, the image of a suitably normalized moment map is the interval $[-\frac{A}{4\pi}, \frac{A}{4\pi}]$. This simple result is a direct consequence of integrating the defining equation of the moment map, $d\mu = \iota_X \omega$, where $X$ is the vector field generating the rotation .

A cornerstone example in higher dimensions is the action of the $n$-torus $T^n$ on [complex projective space](@entry_id:268402) $\mathbb{C}P^n$. The standard action, induced by phase rotations on the [homogeneous coordinates](@entry_id:154569) of $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$, is Hamiltonian. The moment polytope in this case is the standard $n$-dimensional [simplex](@entry_id:270623), $\Delta_n = \{ (x_1, \dots, x_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid x_i \ge 0, \sum x_i \le 1 \}$. The vertices of this [simplex](@entry_id:270623)—the origin and the [standard basis vectors](@entry_id:152417) in $\mathbb{R}^n$—are precisely the images of the $n+1$ fixed points of the $T^n$-action on $\mathbb{C}P^n$. This provides a beautiful geometric interpretation of a fundamental object in algebraic geometry as one of the most basic shapes in [convex geometry](@entry_id:262845) .

The framework elegantly extends to [product spaces](@entry_id:151693). If $(M_1, \omega_1)$ and $(M_2, \omega_2)$ are Hamiltonian $T_1$- and $T_2$-spaces, respectively, then the product manifold $M_1 \times M_2$ admits a Hamiltonian action of the product torus $T_1 \times T_2$ with respect to the product symplectic form $\omega_1 \oplus \omega_2$. The [moment map](@entry_id:157938) for this product action is simply the [direct product](@entry_id:143046) of the individual moment maps. Consequently, the [moment polytope](@entry_id:1128124) of the [product space](@entry_id:151533) is the Cartesian product of the individual moment [polytopes](@entry_id:635589). For instance, the action of the $2$-torus $T^2$ on the product of two spheres, $S^2 \times S^2$, where each circle factor of $T^2$ acts on a corresponding sphere, yields a rectangular [moment polytope](@entry_id:1128124) in $\mathbb{R}^2$. The vertices of this rectangle are the images of the four fixed points of the action, which are the products of the poles of the individual spheres .

### The Algebraic Structure of Moment Polytopes

The connection established by the [convexity](@entry_id:138568) theorem is not merely descriptive; it possesses a rich algebraic structure. Operations on the group action have direct, calculable counterparts as operations on the [moment polytope](@entry_id:1128124).

A key structural property arises when considering the restriction of a Hamiltonian action to a subtorus. If a torus $T$ acts on a manifold $M$, any subtorus $S \subset T$ also acts on $M$. The Hamiltonian nature of the action is preserved under this restriction. The moment map for the $S$-action is obtained by composing the original moment map $\mu: M \to \mathfrak{t}^*$ with the linear projection $\pi: \mathfrak{t}^* \to \mathfrak{s}^*$ that is dual to the inclusion of the Lie algebras $\mathfrak{s} \hookrightarrow \mathfrak{t}$. As a direct consequence, the moment polytope for the $S$-action is the linear projection of the [moment polytope](@entry_id:1128124) for the $T$-action. This principle can be illustrated by considering the $T^2$-action on $S^2 \times S^2$, whose moment polytope is a rectangle. Restricting to the diagonal subtorus $S^1 \subset T^2$ corresponds to projecting the rectangular polytope onto a line, yielding an interval whose length depends on the sum of the radii of the two spheres .

While the Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg theorem is formulated for [abelian groups](@entry_id:145145) (tori), its spirit extends to non-abelian settings through the Kirwan [convexity](@entry_id:138568) theorem. For a compact Lie group $G$ acting on a symplectic manifold, one can consider the restricted action of a maximal torus $T \subset G$. The image of the corresponding [moment map](@entry_id:157938), known as the Kirwan [polytope](@entry_id:635803), is also a [convex polytope](@entry_id:1123046). A canonical example is the [coadjoint action](@entry_id:170681) of $G$ on one of its coadjoint orbits $\mathcal{O}_\lambda$. The action of the maximal torus $T$ is Hamiltonian, and its [moment map](@entry_id:157938) image is precisely the convex hull of the Weyl group orbit of the element $\lambda$. For $G = \mathrm{SU}(3)$, the Weyl group is the [symmetric group](@entry_id:142255) $S_3$, and the moment polytope for the $T^2$-action on an orbit is a hexagon whose vertices are the [permutations](@entry_id:147130) of the components of $\lambda$. This powerful result connects the geometry of coadjoint orbits directly to the [representation theory](@entry_id:137998) of Lie groups, encoded in the combinatorics of Weyl groups and [root systems](@entry_id:198970) .

### Applications in Topology and Geometric Surgery

The convexity theorem provides a remarkable portal into the topology of the underlying manifold and a combinatorial language for describing geometric operations.

A profound connection is revealed through the theory of [symplectic reduction](@entry_id:170200) and the Duistermaat-Heckman theorem. For a Hamiltonian $T$-action with moment map $\mu$, the [level sets](@entry_id:151155) $\mu^{-1}(\xi)$ play a central role. For a [regular value](@entry_id:188218) $\xi$ in the interior of the moment polytope $\Delta$, the level set is a smooth submanifold on which $T$ acts freely, and the [quotient space](@entry_id:148218), or Marsden-Weinstein reduced space $M_\xi = \mu^{-1}(\xi)/T$, is itself a symplectic manifold. The Duistermaat-Heckman theorem states that the [pushforward](@entry_id:158718) of the Liouville volume measure from $M$ to its moment polytope $\Delta$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $\mathfrak{t}^*$. Its density is a [piecewise polynomial](@entry_id:144637) function. Strikingly, the value of this density at a regular point $\xi \in \Delta$ is exactly the symplectic volume of the corresponding reduced space $M_\xi$ . For the $S^1$-action on $S^2$, the reduced spaces are simply points, and the Duistermaat-Heckman density is constant over the interior of the interval-shaped [polytope](@entry_id:635803), with the constant being the "volume" of the circle group, $2\pi$ .

Geometric modifications of the manifold also have elegant combinatorial interpretations. A fundamental operation in algebraic and symplectic geometry is the blow-up. Symplectically blowing up a manifold at a fixed point of a toric action has a surprisingly simple effect on the moment polytope: it "cuts the corner" corresponding to that fixed point. A new facet is created, slicing off the original vertex. The normal vector to this new facet is the sum of the normal vectors of the facets that met at the original vertex. For instance, blowing up a fixed point of $\mathbb{C}P^2$ (whose moment polytope is a triangle) replaces the corresponding vertex with a new edge, resulting in a pentagonal [polytope](@entry_id:635803). The area of the new [polytope](@entry_id:635803) is the area of the original triangle minus the area of the small triangular corner that was removed, a quantity determined by the "capacity" of the blow-up .

For the special class of [symplectic toric manifolds](@entry_id:1132762), the [moment polytope](@entry_id:1128124) encodes the entire topology of the manifold. Using Hamiltonian Morse theory, where the Morse function is a component of the moment map, one can show that all odd-degree Betti numbers of a compact [symplectic toric manifold](@entry_id:1132761) vanish. The even-degree Betti numbers, $b_{2k}(M)$, are given by the components of the *h-vector* of the corresponding Delzant [polytope](@entry_id:635803) $\Delta$. The $k$-th component of the $h$-vector, $h_k(\Delta)$, is a purely combinatorial quantity: it counts the number of vertices of the polytope that have exactly $k$ "downward" edges with respect to a generic [linear functional](@entry_id:144884). This leads to remarkable formulas. For example, the Euler characteristic $\chi(M) = \sum b_i(M)$ is simply the total number of vertices of $\Delta$. The second Betti number, $b_2(M)$, equals $d-n$, where $d$ is the number of facets and $n$ is the dimension of the torus .

### The Delzant Classification of Toric Manifolds

Perhaps the most celebrated application of the [convexity](@entry_id:138568) theorem lies at the heart of the complete classification of compact [symplectic toric manifolds](@entry_id:1132762), a result due to Thomas Delzant. This classification establishes an explicit [bijection](@entry_id:138092) between a class of geometric objects and a class of combinatorial objects.

The combinatorial objects in this correspondence are not arbitrary polytopes, but **Delzant [polytopes](@entry_id:635589)**. A [convex polytope](@entry_id:1123046) in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is Delzant if it is simple (at each vertex, exactly $n$ edges meet), rational (the normal vectors to the facets can be chosen as integer vectors), and smooth (at each vertex, the $n$ primitive integer normal vectors to the incident facets form a basis for the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$). These three conditions are not arbitrary; they are the direct combinatorial translation of the geometric properties of a smooth manifold equipped with an effective Hamiltonian $T^n$-action. The smoothness condition, in particular, ensures that the isotropy group at any point in the manifold is connected, ruling out the finite [isotropy](@entry_id:159159) groups that characterize orbifolds .

Delzant's theorem states that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the [isomorphism classes](@entry_id:147854) of compact, connected symplectic toric $2n$-manifolds and the set of Delzant [polytopes](@entry_id:635589) in $\mathbb{R}^n$, considered up to translation . The "manifold to [polytope](@entry_id:635803)" direction is a direct consequence of the Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg theorem and an analysis of the local structure of the action near fixed points. The more constructive "polytope to manifold" direction is achieved via symplectic reduction. Given a Delzant polytope with $d$ facets, one starts with the standard Hamiltonian $T^d$-action on $\mathbb{C}^d$. The normal vectors of the polytope are used to define a homomorphism from the large torus $T^d$ to the target torus $T^n$. The desired manifold is then constructed as the [symplectic quotient](@entry_id:1132757) of $\mathbb{C}^d$ by the kernel of this homomorphism. The Delzant conditions on the [polytope](@entry_id:635803) are precisely what is needed to ensure this construction yields a smooth, [compact manifold](@entry_id:158804) with the correct properties .

### Interdisciplinary Connections: Integrable Systems and Quantization

The theory of moment polytopes provides a powerful geometric framework for understanding concepts in [mathematical physics](@entry_id:265403), most notably in the study of integrable systems and geometric quantization.

In classical mechanics, a Hamiltonian system with $n$ degrees of freedom is called completely integrable if it possesses $n$ independent conserved quantities that Poisson-commute. In many important cases, these conserved quantities arise as the components of a [moment map](@entry_id:157938) for a Hamiltonian $T^n$-action. The Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg theorem then provides a profound insight: the image of the [moment map](@entry_id:157938), the [polytope](@entry_id:635803) $\Delta$, represents the complete set of accessible values for this vector of conserved quantities. The dynamics of the system are constrained to the [level sets](@entry_id:151155) of the [moment map](@entry_id:157938). Thus, the geometry of the polytope provides a powerful tool for analyzing the qualitative features of the motion and for determining sharp bounds on [physical observables](@entry_id:154692). Any linear combination of the conserved quantities is maximized or minimized at a vertex of the [moment polytope](@entry_id:1128124) .

In [geometric quantization](@entry_id:159174), one seeks to associate a quantum Hilbert space to a classical symplectic phase space. For prequantizable [symplectic toric manifolds](@entry_id:1132762), this procedure yields a spectacular result: the dimension of the quantum Hilbert space is given by the number of integer [lattice points](@entry_id:161785) contained within the corresponding [moment polytope](@entry_id:1128124). For example, for the [line bundle](@entry_id:1127303) $\mathcal{O}(k)$ over $\mathbb{C}P^n$, the dimension of its space of holomorphic sections—the quantum Hilbert space in this context—is given by the number of integer points in the moment [simplex](@entry_id:270623) dilated by a factor of $k$. A classic combinatorial calculation shows this number is $\binom{n+k}{n}$, a result that perfectly matches the dimension computed via algebraic geometry . This correspondence extends to more general spaces, such as Grassmannians, where the fixed points of the torus action map to the integer vertices of the [moment polytope](@entry_id:1128124), a structure known as a hypersimplex . This beautiful interplay, where counting quantum states is equivalent to counting points in a [polytope](@entry_id:635803), is a deep manifestation of the "quantization commutes with reduction" principle and remains a central theme in modern mathematical physics.

In conclusion, the Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg [convexity](@entry_id:138568) theorem is not an isolated result but a gateway. It provides a dictionary that translates the language of symplectic geometry into the language of convex polytopes, enabling the application of powerful combinatorial and algebraic tools to solve geometric and topological problems. From classifying manifolds and computing their invariants to understanding integrable dynamics and counting quantum states, the theorem's influence is a testament to the deep unity of mathematical structures.
