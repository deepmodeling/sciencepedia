The results are mathematically derivable and verifiable.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe first step is to derive the formula for the moment map $\\mu(z)$. We begin by finding the infinitesimal vector field $X_{\\xi}$ on $\\mathbb{C}^3$ associated with a Lie algebra element $\\xi=(\\xi_{1},\\xi_{2}) \\in \\mathfrak{t} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The action of the group element $\\exp(t\\xi) \\in T^2$ on a point $z=(z_1, z_2, z_3) \\in \\mathbb{C}^3$ is given by\n$$ \\exp(t\\xi) \\cdot z_j = \\exp(it\\langle w_j, \\xi \\rangle) z_j $$\nwhere $\\langle w_j, \\xi \\rangle = w_{j1}\\xi_1 + w_{j2}\\xi_2$. The infinitesimal vector field $X_{\\xi}$ is the derivative of this action at $t=0$:\n$$ X_{\\xi}(z) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} (\\exp(t\\xi) \\cdot z) = (i\\langle w_1, \\xi \\rangle z_1, i\\langle w_2, \\xi \\rangle z_2, i\\langle w_3, \\xi \\rangle z_3) $$\nIn real coordinates $z_j = x_j + i y_j$, the components of this vector field are:\n$$ \\dot{x}_j + i\\dot{y}_j = i\\langle w_j, \\xi \\rangle (x_j + i y_j) = -\\langle w_j, \\xi \\rangle y_j + i\\langle w_j, \\xi \\rangle x_j $$\nSo, $X_{\\xi} = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\left( -\\langle w_j, \\xi \\rangle y_j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} + \\langle w_j, \\xi \\rangle x_j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_j} \\right)$.\n\nNext, we compute the interior product $\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega$. The symplectic form is $\\omega = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} dx_j \\wedge dy_j$.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega &= \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\iota_{X_{\\xi}}(dx_j \\wedge dy_j) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{j=1}^{3} (dx_j(X_{\\xi}) dy_j - dy_j(X_{\\xi}) dx_j) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{j=1}^{3} (-\\langle w_j, \\xi \\rangle y_j dy_j - \\langle w_j, \\xi \\rangle x_j dx_j) \\\\\n&= -\\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\langle w_j, \\xi \\rangle (x_j dx_j + y_j dy_j) \\\\\n&= -\\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\langle w_j, \\xi \\rangle d\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(x_j^2 + y_j^2)\\right) \\\\\n&= -d\\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\frac{1}{2} |z_j|^2 \\langle w_j, \\xi \\rangle \\right)\n\\end{align*}\nThe defining relation for the moment map is $d\\langle\\mu,\\xi\\rangle = \\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega$. Substituting our result for $\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega$:\n$$ d\\langle\\mu(z),\\xi\\rangle = -d\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{3} |z_j|^2 \\langle w_j, \\xi \\rangle \\right) $$\nIntegrating this equation gives:\n$$ \\langle\\mu(z),\\xi\\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{3} |z_j|^2 \\langle w_j, \\xi \\rangle + C(\\xi) $$\nwhere $C(\\xi)$ is a constant of integration that can depend on $\\xi$. The normalization condition $\\mu(0)=0$ implies that for $z=(0,0,0)$, we have $\\langle \\mu(0), \\xi \\rangle = 0$. This forces $C(\\xi)=0$. Therefore,\n$$ \\langle\\mu(z),\\xi\\rangle = \\left\\langle -\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{3} |z_j|^2 w_j, \\xi \\right\\rangle $$\nSince this equality holds for all $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{t}$, and we identify $\\mathfrak{t}^* \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$ with $\\mathfrak{t} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$ via the standard dot product, we can identify the moment map $\\mu(z) \\in \\mathfrak{t}^*$ as:\n$$ \\mu(z) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{3} |z_j|^2 w_j $$\nUsing the given weights $w_1=(1,0)$, $w_2=(1,2)$, and $w_3=(2,3)$, the explicit formula for $\\mu(z) = (\\mu_1(z), \\mu_2(z))$ is:\n$$ \\mu(z) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ |z_1|^2(1,0) + |z_2|^2(1,2) + |z_3|^2(2,3) \\right] = \\left( -\\frac{1}{2}(|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 + 2|z_3|^2), -\\frac{1}{2}(2|z_2|^2 + 3|z_3|^2) \\right) $$\n\nNow, we determine the image $\\mu(\\mathbb{C}^3)$. The map $\\mu$ sends $\\mathbb{C}^3$ to the convex cone in $\\mathfrak{t}^* \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$ generated by the vectors $\\{-w_1, -w_2, -w_3\\}$. Let $c_j = \\frac{1}{2}|z_j|^2 \\ge 0$. Then any point in the image can be written as $\\sum_{j=1}^3 (-c_j) w_j = \\sum_{j=1}^3 c_j (-w_j)$. This is the set of all non-negative linear combinations of the vectors $-w_j$.\nThe generators of the cone are:\n$v_1 = -w_1 = (-1,0)$\n$v_2 = -w_2 = (-1,-2)$\n$v_3 = -w_3 = (-2,-3)$\nTo find the extreme rays of the cone, we check for linear dependencies among these generators. We test if $v_3$ is in the conic span of $v_1$ and $v_2$. We seek $a,b \\ge 0$ such that $v_3 = a v_1 + b v_2$:\n$$ (-2,-3) = a(-1,0) + b(-1,-2) = (-a-b, -2b) $$\nComparing components, we get $-2b = -3$, which gives $b = \\frac{3}{2}$. Substituting into the first component equation: $-a - \\frac{3}{2} = -2$, which gives $a = 2 - \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSince $a = \\frac{1}{2} > 0$ and $b = \\frac{3}{2} > 0$, the vector $v_3$ is a positive linear combination of $v_1$ and $v_2$. Thus, $v_3$ lies inside the cone generated by $v_1$ and $v_2$. The set of generators can be reduced to the extremal ones, $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$.\nThe image $\\mu(\\mathbb{C}^3)$ is the convex cone generated by $v_1=(-1,0)$ and $v_2=(-1,-2)$.\nThe extreme rays are the half-lines $\\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}v_1 = \\{ (t,0) \\mid t \\le 0 \\}$ and $\\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}v_2 = \\{ (t,2t) \\mid t \\le 0 \\}$.\nLet $(u,v)$ be coordinates in the target space $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The cone is the region bounded by the rays $v=0$ (for $u \\le 0$) and $v=2u$ (for $u \\le 0$).\nA point $(u,v)$ is in the cone if it can be written as $c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2$ for $c_1, c_2 \\ge 0$.\n$(u,v) = c_1(-1,0) + c_2(-1,-2) = (-c_1-c_2, -2c_2)$.\nSo $u \\le 0$ and $v \\le 0$. Also, $u = -c_1 - c_2 \\le -c_2 = v/2$, so $2u \\le v$.\nThe facet-defining linear inequalities are $v \\le 0$ and $2u - v \\le 0$.\n\nFinally, we compute the opening angle of this cone, which is the angle $\\theta$ between the generating vectors $v_1=(-1,0)$ and $v_2=(-1,-2)$. We use the dot product formula:\n$$ \\cos\\theta = \\frac{v_1 \\cdot v_2}{|v_1| |v_2|} $$\nThe dot product is $v_1 \\cdot v_2 = (-1)(-1) + (0)(-2) = 1$.\nThe magnitudes are $|v_1| = \\sqrt{(-1)^2+0^2} = 1$ and $|v_2| = \\sqrt{(-1)^2+(-2)^2} = \\sqrt{1+4} = \\sqrt{5}$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$ \\cos\\theta = \\frac{1}{1 \\cdot \\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} $$\nThe angle $\\theta$ must be in the interval $[0, \\pi]$. The opening angle of the cone is therefore:\n$$ \\theta = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\\right) $$\nThis is an exact expression for the angle in radians.",

Image of the Moment Map $\\mu_{T^{2}}$**\n\nThe product manifold is $M = \\mathcal{O}_{r_1} \\times \\mathcal{O}_{r_2}$. The Hamiltonian action of the torus $T^2 = S^1 \\times S^1$ on $M$ is defined such that the first $S^1$ factor acts on $\\mathcal{O}_{r_1}$ by rotation about the $z$-axis, and the second $S^1$ factor acts on $\\mathcal{O}_{r_2}$ similarly.\n\nThe problem states that for a single coadjoint orbit $\\mathcal{O}_r \\subset \\mathfrak{su}(2)^* \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3$, the moment map for the $S^1$ action (rotation about the $z$-axis) is given by the projection onto the $z$-axis. Let's denote the coordinates on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ by $(k_x, k_y, k_z)$. A point on the sphere $\\mathcal{O}_r$ has coordinates satisfying $k_x^2 + k_y^2 + k_z^2 = r^2$. The moment map is the function $p \\mapsto k_z(p)$, and its image is the interval $[-r, r]$.\n\nFor the product manifold $M = \\mathcal{O}_{r_1} \\times \\mathcal{O}_{r_2}$, the moment map $\\mu_{T^{2}}: M \\to \\mathfrak{t}^{2*} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$ is given by the pair of individual moment maps. Let $p = (p_1, p_2) \\in M$, where $p_1 \\in \\mathcal{O}_{r_1}$ and $p_2 \\in \\mathcal{O}_{r_2}$. Let their respective $z$-coordinates be $z_1$ and $z_2$. Then the moment map is $\\mu_{T^{2}}(p_1, p_2) = (z_1, z_2)$.\n\nThe image of the moment map for the action on $\\mathcal{O}_{r_1}$ is the interval $I_1 = [-r_1, r_1]$. The image of the moment map for the action on $\\mathcal{O}_{r_2}$ is the interval $I_2 = [-r_2, r_2]$. Since any value $z_1 \\in I_1$ can be realized independently of any value $z_2 \\in I_2$, the image of the combined moment map $\\mu_{T^2}$ is the Cartesian product of the individual images:\n$$ \\mathrm{Im}(\\mu_{T^{2}}) = I_1 \\times I_2 = [-r_1, r_1] \\times [-r_2, r_2] $$\nThis is a closed rectangle in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg theorem asserts that this image is the convex hull of the images of the fixed points of the action. In this case, the image is a convex polytope, specifically a rectangle.\n\n**2. Image of the Restricted Moment Map $\\mu_{\\mathrm{diag}}$**\n\nWe consider the diagonal subtorus $S^1_{\\mathrm{diag}} \\subset T^2$, whose action is induced by the group homomorphism $i : S^1 \\to T^2$ given by $i(\\theta) = (\\theta, \\theta)$. The problem states that the dual map on the Lie algebra duals $i^*: \\mathfrak{t}^{2*} \\to \\mathfrak{s}^{1*}$ is given by $i^*(x,y) = x+y$, where we identify $\\mathfrak{t}^{2*} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\\mathfrak{s}^{1*} \\cong \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe moment map for this restricted action, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{diag}}: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$, is given by the composition $\\mu_{\\mathrm{diag}} = i^* \\circ \\mu_{T^{2}}$. The image of $\\mu_{\\mathrm{diag}}$ is therefore the image of $\\mathrm{Im}(\\mu_{T^{2}})$ under the linear map $i^*$.\n$$ \\mathrm{Im}(\\mu_{\\mathrm{diag}}) = i^*(\\mathrm{Im}(\\mu_{T^{2}})) = i^*([-r_1, r_1] \\times [-r_2, r_2]) $$\nThis set consists of all possible sums $z_1 + z_2$ where $z_1 \\in [-r_1, r_1]$ and $z_2 \\in [-r_2, r_2]$. This operation is the Minkowski sum of the two intervals. The resulting set is itself an interval. To find its bounds, we find the minimum and maximum values of the function $f(z_1, z_2) = z_1 + z_2$ on the rectangular domain $[-r_1, r_1] \\times [-r_2, r_2]$.\n\nThe minimum value is achieved when $z_1$ and $z_2$ are at their minimum values, i.e., $z_1 = -r_1$ and $z_2 = -r_2$.\n$$ \\min(z_1+z_2) = -r_1 - r_2 = -(r_1+r_2) $$\nThe maximum value is achieved when $z_1$ and $z_2$ are at their maximum values, i.e., $z_1 = r_1$ and $z_2 = r_2$.\n$$ \\max(z_1+z_2) = r_1 + r_2 $$\nSince the function $z_1+z_2$ is continuous and its domain is connected, its image is the interval connecting the minimum and maximum values.\n$$ \\mathrm{Im}(\\mu_{\\mathrm{diag}}) = [-(r_1+r_2), r_1+r_2] $$\n\n**3. Vertices and Primitive Outward Facet Normals**\n\nThe image of $\\mu_{T^2}$ is a convex polytope (a rectangle). The map $i^*$ is linear. A fundamental property of convex polytopes is that their image under a linear map is also a convex polytope. Therefore, $\\mathrm{Im}(\\mu_{\\mathrm{diag}})$ is a convex polytope.\nThe set $[-(r_1+r_2), r_1+r_2]$ is a $1$-dimensional convex polytope in $\\mathbb{R}$. A convex polytope is the convex hull of its vertices. For an interval, the vertices are its endpoints.\n- The vertices of $\\mathrm{Im}(\\mu_{\\mathrm{diag}})$ are $-(r_1+r_2)$ and $r_1+r_2$.\n\nA convex polytope can be defined by a set of linear inequalities of the form $\\langle u_j, x \\rangle \\le c_j$, where the $u_j$ are the outward-pointing facet normals. For our $1$-dimensional polytope $P = [-(r_1+r_2), r_1+r_2] \\subset \\mathbb{R}$, we can write it as the set of $z \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that:\n$$ -(r_1+r_2) \\le z \\quad \\text{and} \\quad z \\le r_1+r_2 $$\nWe rewrite these inequalities in the standard form $\\langle u, z \\rangle \\le c$, where the pairing is the standard multiplication in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n1.  $z \\le r_1+r_2$ becomes $\\langle 1, z \\rangle \\le r_1+r_2$. The outward normal for this facet (the endpoint $r_1+r_2$) is $u_1=1$. This is a primitive integer vector.\n2.  $-(r_1+r_2) \\le z$ is equivalent to $-z \\le r_1+r_2$, which becomes $\\langle -1, z \\rangle \\le r_1+r_2$. The outward normal for this facet (the endpoint $-(r_1+r_2)$) is $u_2=-1$. This is also a primitive integer vector.\n\nSo, the vertices of the image polytope are $-(r_1+r_2)$ and $r_1+r_2$.

This exercise tackles that question by examining the canonical action on the cotangent bundle of the circle, $T^*S^1$.

Your final answer must be the closed-form analytic expression for the moment map $J(\\theta,p)$ under the above identification and normalization.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the construction and analysis of the moment map for the canonical $S^1$-action on the cotangent bundle $T^*S^1$.\n\nFirst, we establish the geometric and symplectic setup. The manifold is the cotangent bundle $M = T^*S^1$, which we identify with the cylinder $S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ using canonical coordinates $(\\theta, p)$. Here, $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}/2\\pi\\mathbb{Z}$ is the position coordinate on the circle $S^1$, and $p \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is the momentum coordinate in the fiber. The canonical Liouville one-form on $T^*S^1$ is given by $\\alpha = p \\, d\\theta$. The canonical symplectic two-form is $\\omega = d\\alpha$. A standard convention for the exterior derivative gives $\\omega = dp \\wedge d\\theta$. We will adopt the orientation $\\omega = d\\theta \\wedge dp$, which is also standard and only affects an overall sign, which can be absorbed by other conventions.\n\nThe circle group $G=S^1$ acts on the base manifold $S^1$ by rotation. Let $\\phi \\in S^1$ be an element of the group, represented by its angle. The action on a point $\\theta \\in S^1$ is given by $\\Phi_\\phi(\\theta) = \\theta + \\phi$. This action lifts to the cotangent bundle $T^*S^1$. The lifted action on a point $(\\theta, p)$ is determined by how covectors transform. The transformation on the base is $\\theta' = \\theta + \\phi$. Its inverse is $\\theta = \\theta' - \\phi$. The cotangent lift action is given by $\\Phi_\\phi^T(\\theta, p) = (\\theta', p')$, where $p' = (\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial \\theta'}) p = p$. Thus, the lifted action is $\\Phi_\\phi^T(\\theta, p) = (\\theta + \\phi, p)$.\n\nThe Lie algebra of $S^1$ is $\\mathfrak{s}^1 \\cong \\mathbb{R}$. The problem specifies an identification where the generator of the Lie algebra, let's call it $X$, corresponds to $1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. To find the fundamental vector field $X_{M}$ on $M=T^*S^1$ associated with this generator, we compute the derivative of the flow at time $t=0$:\n$$ X_{M}(\\theta,p) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\Phi_{t}^{T}(\\theta,p) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} (\\theta+t, p) = (1, 0) $$\nIn the basis $(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p})$, this vector field is $X_{M} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}$.\n\nThe moment map $J: T^*S^1 \\to \\mathfrak{s}^{1}{}^*$ is defined by the condition that for any $Y \\in \\mathfrak{s}^1$, the function $J_Y(m) = \\langle J(m), Y \\rangle$ is a Hamiltonian for the vector field $Y_M$. This means $d J_Y = i_{Y_M} \\omega$.\nWith our identification $\\mathfrak{s}^1 \\cong \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathfrak{s}^{1}{}^* \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, we can consider $J$ as a real-valued function on $T^*S^1$ corresponding to the generator $X \\leftrightarrow 1$. The defining equation for $J$ is $dJ = i_{X_{M}} \\omega$.\nWe compute the right-hand side:\n$$ i_{X_{M}} \\omega = i_{\\partial/\\partial\\theta} (d\\theta \\wedge dp) = (i_{\\partial/\\partial\\theta} d\\theta) \\wedge dp - d\\theta \\wedge (i_{\\partial/\\partial\\theta} dp) $$\nUsing the facts that $d\\theta(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}) = 1$ and $dp(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}) = 0$, we get:\n$$ i_{X_{M}} \\omega = 1 \\cdot dp - d\\theta \\cdot 0 = dp $$\nOur equation for the moment map is $dJ = dp$. The total differential of a function $J(\\theta, p)$ is $dJ = \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\theta}d\\theta + \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial p}dp$. Comparing the two expressions for $dJ$, we deduce:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\theta} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial p} = 1 $$\nIntegrating the second equation with respect to $p$ yields $J(\\theta, p) = p + C(\\theta)$ for some function $C(\\theta)$. The first equation, $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\theta} = \\frac{dC}{d\\theta} = 0$, implies that $C$ must be a constant. So, $J(\\theta, p) = p + C$.\n\nWe now apply the normalization condition: $\\langle J(\\theta, p), 1 \\rangle = 0$ on the zero section $p=0$. With our identifications, this simplifies to $J(\\theta, 0) = 0$.\n$$ J(\\theta, 0) = 0 + C = 0 \\implies C=0 $$\nThus, the unique expression for the moment map is $J(\\theta, p) = p$.\n\nNext, we analyze the properties of this map $J: S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe image of $J$ is the set of all possible values of $p$. Since $p \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the image of $J$ is $\\text{Im}(J) = \\mathbb{R}$. A subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ is convex if and only if it is an interval. Since $\\mathbb{R}=(-\\infty, \\infty)$ is an interval, the image of $J$ is convex.\n\nThe map $J$ is proper if the preimage of every compact set in $\\mathbb{R}$ is compact in $S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$. Let $K \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ be a compact set. By the Heine-Borel theorem, $K$ is closed and bounded. The preimage of $K$ is\n$$ J^{-1}(K) = \\{ (\\theta,p) \\in S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R} \\mid J(\\theta,p) \\in K \\} = \\{ (\\theta,p) \\mid p \\in K \\} = S^1 \\times K $$\nThe manifold $S^1$ is compact, and $K$ is compact by assumption. By Tychonoff's theorem, the product of compact spaces is compact. Thus, $S^1 \\times K$ is compact. We conclude that $J$ is a proper map.\n\nFinally, we consider the Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg convexity theorem. The standard theorem applies to Hamiltonian actions on compact, connected symplectic manifolds. Our manifold $T^*S^1$ is connected but not compact, so the standard theorem does not apply. However, a major generalization of this theorem states that for a Hamiltonian torus action on a connected symplectic manifold, if the moment map is proper, then its image is a convex polyhedron. Our results are a clear instance of this generalization. The action is by the $1$-torus $S^1$, the manifold is non-compact, and we have shown that the moment map $J$ is proper. The theorem then correctly predicts that the image of $J$, which is $\\mathbb{R}$, is convex (as $\\mathbb{R}$ is a $1$-dimensional, unbounded convex polyhedron). This confirms that the property of properness for the moment map is a sufficient condition for the convexity of its image, even when the underlying manifold is not compact.",
