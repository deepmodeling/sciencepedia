            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the Hamiltonian function associated with the infinitesimal generator of rotations on the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$, equipped with the symplectic form $\\omega = dp \\wedge dq$. We will proceed in three steps as outlined in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we compute the fundamental vector field (infinitesimal generator) $X_{\\xi}$ for the element $\\xi=1 \\in \\mathfrak{so}(2) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$. The Lie group is $SO(2)$, acting on the manifold $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with coordinates $(q,p)$. A point $z \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ is represented by the column vector $\\begin{pmatrix} q \\\\ p \\end{pmatrix}$. The action of $\\exp(t\\xi) \\in SO(2)$ is a rotation by an angle $\\theta = t\\xi$. For $\\xi=1$, this is a rotation by an angle $t$. The action on $z$ is given by matrix multiplication:\n$$ \\Phi_t(z) = \\exp(t) \\cdot z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos t & -\\sin t \\\\ \\sin t & \\cos t \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} q \\\\ p \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} q \\cos t - p \\sin t \\\\ q \\sin t + p \\cos t \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe fundamental vector field $X_1$ at the point $z=(q,p)$ is defined as the time derivative of this action at $t=0$:\n$$ X_1(z) = \\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} \\left( \\exp(t) \\cdot z \\right) = \\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} \\begin{pmatrix} q \\cos t - p \\sin t \\\\ q \\sin t + p \\cos t \\end{pmatrix} $$\nDifferentiating the components with respect to $t$ gives:\n$$ \\left. \\begin{pmatrix} -q \\sin t - p \\cos t \\\\ q \\cos t - p \\sin t \\end{pmatrix} \\right|_{t=0} = \\begin{pmatrix} -p \\\\ q \\end{pmatrix} $$\nIn the coordinate basis $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\\}$, the vector field is written as:\n$$ X_1 = -p \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q} + q \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} $$\n\nSecond, we verify that the symplectic form $\\omega = dp \\wedge dq$ is preserved by this infinitesimal symmetry. This is equivalent to showing that the Lie derivative of $\\omega$ with respect to $X_1$ is zero, i.e., $L_{X_1}\\omega = 0$. We use Cartan's formula: $L_V \\alpha = i_V(d\\alpha) + d(i_V\\alpha)$.\nIn our case, $\\alpha = \\omega = dp \\wedge dq$. Since $\\omega$ is a $2$-form on a $2$-dimensional manifold, its exterior derivative $d\\omega$ is a $3$-form, which must be zero. Formally, $d\\omega = d(dp \\wedge dq) = (d(dp)) \\wedge dq - dp \\wedge (d(dq)) = 0 \\wedge dq - dp \\wedge 0 = 0$. The form $\\omega$ is closed.\nThus, Cartan's formula simplifies to $L_{X_1}\\omega = d(i_{X_1}\\omega)$. We need to compute the interior product $i_{X_1}\\omega$:\n$$ i_{X_1}\\omega = i_{X_1}(dp \\wedge dq) $$\nUsing the property $i_V(A \\wedge B) = (i_V A) \\wedge B - A \\wedge (i_V B)$, we have:\n$$ i_{X_1}\\omega = (i_{X_1}dp) \\wedge dq - dp \\wedge (i_{X_1}dq) $$\nThe interior product of a vector field $V$ with an exact $1$-form $df$ is $i_V df = df(V) = V(f)$. Thus:\n$$ i_{X_1}dp = dp(X_1) = \\left(-p \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q} + q \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\\right)p = q $$\n$$ i_{X_1}dq = dq(X_1) = \\left(-p \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q} + q \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\\right)q = -p $$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $i_{X_1}\\omega$:\n$$ i_{X_1}\\omega = q \\cdot dq - dp \\wedge (-p) = q \\, dq + p \\, dp $$\nNow we compute the exterior derivative of this $1$-form:\n$$ d(i_{X_1}\\omega) = d(p \\, dp + q \\, dq) = d(p \\, dp) + d(q \\, dq) $$\nSince $dp \\wedge dp = 0$ and $dq \\wedge dq = 0$, we have $d(p \\, dp) = dp \\wedge dp = 0$ and $d(q \\, dq) = dq \\wedge dq = 0$.\nTherefore, $d(i_{X_1}\\omega) = 0$, which implies $L_{X_1}\\omega = 0$. This confirms the rotational symmetry is a symplectic symmetry.\n\nThird, we determine the Hamiltonian function $H_1(q,p)$ that generates the vector field $X_1$. The problem specifies the relationship $i_{X_1}\\omega = dH_1$. From the previous step, we have already computed the left-hand side:\n$$ i_{X_1}\\omega = p \\, dp + q \\, dq $$\nThus, we must find a function $H_1(q,p)$ such that its differential is $dH_1 = p \\, dp + q \\, dq$. By definition, the differential is also given by $dH_1 = \\frac{\\partial H_1}{\\partial q} dq + \\frac{\\partial H_1}{\\partial p} dp$.\nBy equating the coefficients of the basis $1$-forms $dq$ and $dp$, we obtain a system of partial differential equations:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial H_1}{\\partial q} = q $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial H_1}{\\partial p} = p $$\nIntegrating the first equation with respect to $q$:\n$$ H_1(q,p) = \\int q \\, dq = \\frac{1}{2}q^2 + f(p) $$\nwhere $f(p)$ is an arbitrary function of $p$. Differentiating this expression with respect to $p$ gives $\\frac{\\partial H_1}{\\partial p} = f'(p)$. Comparing with the second equation, we find $f'(p) = p$.\nIntegrating with respect to $p$:\n$$ f(p) = \\int p \\, dp = \\frac{1}{2}p^2 + C $$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. Substituting this back gives the general solution for the Hamiltonian function:\n$$ H_1(q,p) = \\frac{1}{2}q^2 + \\frac{1}{2}p^2 + C = \\frac{1}{2}(q^2 + p^2) + C $$\nThe problem requires normalization such that $H_1(0,0)=0$. Applying this condition:\n$$ H_1(0,0) = \\frac{1}{2}(0^2 + 0^2) + C = C $$\nSo, we must have $C=0$. The required Hamiltonian function is:\n$$ H_1(q,p) = \\frac{1}{2}(q^2 + p^2) $$\nThis function is the moment map for the $SO(2)$ action and corresponds physically to the conserved quantity of angular momentum (up to a constant factor, depending on the physical interpretation of $q$ and $p$).",

            "solution": "The solution is presented in three parts as requested, followed by the final determination of the conserved quantity's value.\n\n**Part 1: The Flow of $F$ as Canonical Transformations**\n\nThe Hamiltonian vector field $X_F$ corresponding to the function $F$ is defined by the relation $\\iota_{X_F} \\omega = dF$.\nFirst, we compute the exterior derivative of $F=q_{1}p_{2}+q_{2}p_{1}$:\n$$\ndF = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial q_{1}} dq_{1} + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial q_{2}} dq_{2} + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p_{1}} dp_{1} + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p_{2}} dp_{2} = p_{2}dq_{1} + p_{1}dq_{2} + q_{2}dp_{1} + q_{1}dp_{2}.\n$$\nLet the vector field be $X_F = A_1\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{1}} + A_2\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{2}} + B_1\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{1}} + B_2\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{2}}$. The interior product $\\iota_{X_F}\\omega$ is:\n$$\n\\iota_{X_F}\\omega = \\iota_{X_F}(dq_{1}\\wedge dp_{1} + dq_{2}\\wedge dp_{2}) = (\\iota_{X_F}dq_{1})dp_{1} - (\\iota_{X_F}dp_{1})dq_{1} + (\\iota_{X_F}dq_{2})dp_{2} - (\\iota_{X_F}dp_{2})dq_{2}.\n$$\nThis evaluates to:\n$$\n\\iota_{X_F}\\omega = A_1 dp_{1} - B_1 dq_{1} + A_2 dp_{2} - B_2 dq_{2} = -B_1 dq_{1} - B_2 dq_{2} + A_1 dp_{1} + A_2 dp_{2}.\n$$\nEquating the coefficients of the $1$-forms in $dF$ and $\\iota_{X_F}\\omega$:\n- Coefficient of $dq_{1}$: $p_{2} = -B_1 \\implies B_1 = -p_{2}$.\n- Coefficient of $dq_{2}$: $p_{1} = -B_2 \\implies B_2 = -p_{1}$.\n- Coefficient of $dp_{1}$: $q_{2} = A_1$.\n- Coefficient of $dp_{2}$: $q_{1} = A_2$.\n\nSo, the Hamiltonian vector field is $X_F = q_{2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{1}} + q_{1}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{2}} - p_{2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{1}} - p_{1}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{2}}$.\n\nThe one-parameter flow $(\\phi_s)$ generated by $X_F$ consists of canonical transformations (symplectomorphisms) if $\\phi_s^*\\omega = \\omega$ for all $s \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This condition is equivalent to the Lie derivative of $\\omega$ with respect to $X_F$ being zero, i.e., $\\mathcal{L}_{X_F}\\omega = 0$.\nUsing Cartan's magic formula, the Lie derivative is given by $\\mathcal{L}_{X_F}\\omega = d(\\iota_{X_F}\\omega) + \\iota_{X_F}(d\\omega)$.\nThe symplectic form $\\omega=dq_{1}\\wedge dp_{1}+dq_{2}\\wedge dp_{2}$ is closed by construction, meaning $d\\omega=0$. Thus, the formula simplifies to $\\mathcal{L}_{X_F}\\omega = d(\\iota_{X_F}\\omega)$.\nFrom the definition of the Hamiltonian vector field, we have $\\iota_{X_F}\\omega = dF$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for the Lie derivative gives:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{X_F}\\omega = d(dF).\n$$\nA fundamental property of the exterior derivative is that it is nilpotent, i.e., $d^2 = 0$. Therefore, $d(dF) = 0$.\nWe have shown that $\\mathcal{L}_{X_F}\\omega = 0$, which implies that the symplectic form $\\omega$ is preserved by the flow of $X_F$. Consequently, each map $\\phi_s$ in the one-parameter flow is a symplectomorphism.\n\n**Part 2: The Poisson Bracket and Conservation of $F$**\n\nThe Poisson bracket of two functions $A$ and $B$ in canonical coordinates is defined as $\\{A,B\\} = \\sum_{i=1}^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial q_{i}}\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial p_{i}} - \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial p_{i}}\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial q_{i}}\\right)$. We compute $\\{F,H\\}$.\nThe required partial derivatives are:\nFor $F = q_1 p_2 + q_2 p_1$:\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial q_1} = p_2$, $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial q_2} = p_1$, $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p_1} = q_2$, $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p_2} = q_1$.\nFor $H = \\frac{1}{2}(p_1^2 - p_2^2) + U(q_1^2 - q_2^2)$, let $v=q_1^2 - q_2^2$ and $U'(v) = \\frac{dU}{dv}$:\n$\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q_1} = U'(v)\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial q_1} = 2q_1 U'(v)$, $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q_2} = U'(v)\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial q_2} = -2q_2 U'(v)$, $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_1} = p_1$, $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_2} = -p_2$.\n\nNow we compute the Poisson bracket:\n$$\n\\{F,H\\} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial q_{1}}\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_{1}} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p_{1}}\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q_{1}}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial q_{2}}\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_{2}} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p_{2}}\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q_{2}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\{F,H\\} = (p_2)(p_1) - (q_2)(2q_1 U'(v)) + (p_1)(-p_2) - (q_1)(-2q_2 U'(v))\n$$\n$$\n\\{F,H\\} = p_1 p_2 - 2q_1 q_2 U'(v) - p_1 p_2 + 2q_1 q_2 U'(v) = 0.\n$$\nThus, we have verified that $\\{F,H\\}=0$.\n\nNow, we show that $F$ is constant along the trajectories of the Hamiltonian flow generated by $H$. The time evolution of $F$ along a trajectory $(q(t), p(t))$ is given by its total time derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{dF}{dt} = \\sum_{i=1}^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial q_i}\\dot{q}_i + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p_i}\\dot{p}_i\\right).\n$$\nUsing Hamilton's equations for the flow of $H$: $\\dot{q}_i = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_i}$ and $\\dot{p}_i = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q_i}$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\frac{dF}{dt}$ yields the definition of the Poisson bracket:\n$$\n\\frac{dF}{dt} = \\sum_{i=1}^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial q_i}\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_i} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p_i}\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q_i}\\right) = \\{F,H\\}.\n$$\nSince we have already computed $\\{F,H\\}=0$, it follows immediately that $\\frac{dF}{dt}=0$. This confirms that $F$ is a constant of motion, or conserved quantity, for the Hamiltonian system governed by $H$.\n\n**Part 3: The Flow of $F$ and Invariance of $H$**\n\nThe one-parameter flow $(\\phi_s)$ generated by $F$ is found by solving Hamilton's equations with $F$ as the Hamiltonian, where $s$ is the flow parameter. The ODEs are:\n$\\frac{dq_1}{ds} = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p_1} = q_2$\n$\\frac{dq_2}{ds} = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p_2} = q_1$\n$\\frac{dp_1}{ds} = -\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial q_1} = -p_2$\n$\\frac{dp_2}{ds} = -\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial q_2} = -p_1$\n\nThis is a system of linear ODEs. We can solve it by considering combinations of variables. For the coordinates:\n$\\frac{d}{ds}(q_1+q_2) = q_2+q_1 \\implies q_1(s)+q_2(s) = (q_1(0)+q_2(0)) e^s$.\n$\\frac{d}{ds}(q_1-q_2) = q_2-q_1 \\implies q_1(s)-q_2(s) = (q_1(0)-q_2(0)) e^{-s}$.\nFor the momenta:\n$\\frac{d}{ds}(p_1+p_2) = -p_2-p_1 \\implies p_1(s)+p_2(s) = (p_1(0)+p_2(0)) e^{-s}$.\n$\\frac{d}{ds}(p_1-p_2) = -p_2-(-p_1) = p_1-p_2 \\implies p_1(s)-p_2(s) = (p_1(0)-p_2(0)) e^s$.\n\nSolving these for the individual components gives the finite transformations $\\phi_s(q,p) = (q',p')$:\n$q_1' = q_1 \\cosh(s) + q_2 \\sinh(s)$\n$q_2' = q_2 \\cosh(s) + q_1 \\sinh(s)$\n$p_1' = p_1 \\cosh(s) - p_2 \\sinh(s)$\n$p_2' = p_2 \\cosh(s) - p_1 \\sinh(s)$\n\nThese transformations are hyperbolic rotations. Let's find nontrivial invariants. Consider the quantity $q_1^2 - q_2^2$:\n$(q_1')^2 - (q_2')^2 = (q_1 \\cosh s + q_2 \\sinh s)^2 - (q_2 \\cosh s + q_1 \\sinh s)^2$\n$= q_1^2(\\cosh^2 s - \\sinh^2 s) - q_2^2(\\cosh^2 s - \\sinh^2 s) = q_1^2 - q_2^2$.\nSo, $q_1^2-q_2^2$ is an invariant of the flow $\\phi_s$.\nSimilarly, for $p_1^2 - p_2^2$:\n$(p_1')^2 - (p_2')^2 = (p_1 \\cosh s - p_2 \\sinh s)^2 - (p_2 \\cosh s - p_1 \\sinh s)^2$\n$= p_1^2(\\cosh^2 s - \\sinh^2 s) - p_2^2(\\cosh^2 s - \\sinh^2 s) = p_1^2 - p_2^2$.\nSo, $p_1^2 - p_2^2$ is also an invariant.\n\nThe invariance of $H$ under the flow $\\phi_s$ is now straightforward to justify. The Hamiltonian is $H = \\frac{1}{2}(p_1^2-p_2^2) + U(q_1^2-q_2^2)$. Applying the transformation $\\phi_s$ to the arguments of $H$:\n$$\nH \\circ \\phi_s = \\frac{1}{2}\\big((p_1')^2-(p_2')^2\\big) + U\\big((q_1')^2-(q_2')^2\\big).\n$$\nUsing the invariants we just found:\n$$\nH \\circ \\phi_s = \\frac{1}{2}\\big(p_1^2-p_2^2\\big) + U\\big(q_1^2-q_2^2\\big) = H.\n$$\nThis shows that $H$ is invariant under the one-parameter group of transformations generated by $F$. This is the finite transformation counterpart to the infinitesimal condition $\\{H,F\\}=0$.\n\n**Final Determination of the Conserved Quantity's Value**\n\nThe problem asks for the conserved quantity induced by the one-parameter group generated by $F$. Noether's theorem in the Hamiltonian formalism states that if a function $G$ generates a symmetry of the Hamiltonian $H$ (i.e., $\\{H,G\\}=0$), then $G$ itself is a conserved quantity along the flow of $H$.\nWe have shown that $\\{F,H\\}=0$, which is equivalent to $\\{H,F\\}=0$. Thus, $F$ is a symmetry generator for $H$, and consequently, $F$ is a conserved quantity for the system.\nThe value of this conserved quantity is constant along any trajectory of the system evolving under $H$. To find this constant value, we evaluate $F$ at the given initial condition:\n$(q_1(0), q_2(0), p_1(0), p_2(0)) = (\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta)$.\nThe function is $F(q_1, q_2, p_1, p_2) = q_1 p_2 + q_2 p_1$.\nEvaluating $F$ at $t=0$:\n$$\nF\\big(q_1(0),q_2(0),p_1(0),p_2(0)\\big) = q_1(0)p_2(0) + q_2(0)p_1(0) = (\\alpha)(\\delta) + (\\beta)(\\gamma).\n$$\nThis value, $\\alpha\\delta + \\beta\\gamma$, remains constant for all time $t \\ge 0$ along the specific trajectory starting from the given initial state.\nThe final required answer is this constant value.",

These equations are:\n$$\n\\dot{q} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} = \\frac{p}{m}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{p} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q} = -m\\omega^{2}q + f_{0}\\cos(\\Omega t).\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for the total time derivative of $F$ yields the condition for conservation:\n$$\n\\frac{dF}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial q}\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p}\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q} = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial t} + \\{F,H\\} = 0.\n$$\nThis is the conservation law that the desired quantity $F(q,p,t)$ must satisfy.\n\nThe problem suggests constructing $F$ by using a time-dependent phase space translation determined by a particular solution of the oscillator's equation of motion. First, we derive the second-order ordinary differential equation for the coordinate $q$. Differentiating $\\dot{q} = p/m$ with respect to time gives $\\ddot{q} = \\dot{p}/m$. Substituting the expression for $\\dot{p}$:\n$$\n\\ddot{q} = \\frac{1}{m}(-m\\omega^{2}q + f_{0}\\cos(\\Omega t))\n$$\n$$\n\\ddot{q} + \\omega^{2}q = \\frac{f_{0}}{m}\\cos(\\Omega t).\n$$\nThis is the equation of a driven harmonic oscillator. We seek a particular solution, $q_{p}(t)$, to this inhomogeneous equation. Given the form of the driving term and the condition $\\Omega \\neq \\omega$, we propose a solution of the form $q_{p}(t) = A \\cos(\\Omega t)$. Substituting this into the differential equation:\n$$\n-A\\Omega^{2}\\cos(\\Omega t) + \\omega^{2}A\\cos(\\Omega t) = \\frac{f_{0}}{m}\\cos(\\Omega t).\n$$\nFactoring out $A\\cos(\\Omega t)$ yields:\n$$\nA(\\omega^{2} - \\Omega^{2}) = \\frac{f_{0}}{m}.\n$$\nSince $\\omega \\neq \\Omega$, we can solve for the amplitude $A$:\n$$\nA = \\frac{f_{0}}{m(\\omega^{2} - \\Omega^{2})}.\n$$\nThus, the particular solution for the position is\n$$\nq_{p}(t) = \\frac{f_{0}}{m(\\omega^{2} - \\Omega^{2})}\\cos(\\Omega t).\n$$\nThe corresponding particular solution for the momentum, $p_{p}(t)$, is found by $p_{p}(t) = m\\dot{q}_{p}(t)$:\n$$\np_{p}(t) = m \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{f_{0}}{m(\\omega^{2} - \\Omega^{2})}\\cos(\\Omega t)\\right) = m \\left(-\\frac{f_{0}\\Omega}{m(\\omega^{2} - \\Omega^{2})}\\sin(\\Omega t)\\right)\n$$\n$$\np_{p}(t) = -\\frac{f_{0}\\Omega}{\\omega^{2} - \\Omega^{2}}\\sin(\\Omega t).\n$$\nThe trajectory $(q_{p}(t), p_{p}(t))$ is a specific solution to Hamilton's equations of motion.\n\nNow, we perform a time-dependent translation of the phase space coordinates:\n$$\n\\bar{q} = q - q_{p}(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{p} = p - p_{p}(t).\n$$\nThe physical interpretation of $(\\bar{q}, \\bar{p})$ is the deviation of the system's state from the particular oscillatory solution driven by the external force. Let us find the equations of motion for these new variables:\n$$\n\\dot{\\bar{q}} = \\dot{q} - \\dot{q}_{p} = \\frac{p}{m} - \\frac{p_{p}}{m} = \\frac{p - p_{p}}{m} = \\frac{\\bar{p}}{m}.\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{\\bar{p}} = \\dot{p} - \\dot{p}_{p} = (-m\\omega^{2}q + f_{0}\\cos(\\Omega t)) - (-m\\omega^{2}q_{p} + f_{0}\\cos(\\Omega t)) = -m\\omega^{2}(q - q_{p}) = -m\\omega^{2}\\bar{q}.\n$$\nThe variables $(\\bar{q}, \\bar{p})$ obey Hamilton's equations for a simple (undriven) harmonic oscillator with Hamiltonian $H_{0}(\\bar{q}, \\bar{p}) = \\frac{\\bar{p}^{2}}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^{2}\\bar{q}^{2}$. Since this Hamiltonian $H_{0}$ has no explicit time dependence, its value is conserved along the trajectories of $(\\bar{q}(t), \\bar{p}(t))$.\n\nThis conserved quantity is the function $F(q,p,t)$ we seek. It is the energy of the system in the co-moving frame defined by the particular solution $(q_{p}(t), p_{p}(t))$:\n$$\nF(q,p,t) = H_{0}(\\bar{q}, \\bar{p}) = \\frac{\\bar{p}^{2}}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^{2}\\bar{q}^{2}.\n$$\nSubstituting the definitions of $\\bar{q}$ and $\\bar{p}$ in terms of the original coordinates $(q,p)$ and time $t$, we obtain:\n$$\nF(q,p,t) = \\frac{(p - p_{p}(t))^{2}}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^{2}(q - q_{p}(t))^{2}.\n$$\nTo obtain the final explicit form, we substitute the expressions for $q_{p}(t)$ and $p_{p}(t)$:\n$$\nF(q,p,t) = \\frac{1}{2m}\\left(p - \\left(-\\frac{f_{0}\\Omega}{\\omega^{2} - \\Omega^{2}}\\sin(\\Omega t)\\right)\\right)^{2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^{2}\\left(q - \\frac{f_{0}}{m(\\omega^{2} - \\Omega^{2})}\\cos(\\Omega t)\\right)^{2}.\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the conserved quantity:\n$$\nF(q,p,t) = \\frac{1}{2m}\\left(p + \\frac{f_{0}\\Omega}{\\omega^{2} - \\Omega^{2}}\\sin(\\Omega t)\\right)^{2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^{2}\\left(q - \\frac{f_{0}}{m(\\omega^{2} - \\Omega^{2})}\\cos(\\Omega t)\\right)^{2}.\n$$\nThis function $F(q,p,t)$ is explicitly given in terms of the phase space variables, time, and the system parameters. By construction, it is constant along any dynamical trajectory of the driven harmonic oscillator, satisfying $\\partial_{t}F + \\{F,H\\} = 0$. This quantity is sometimes referred to as the \"pseudo-energy\" or Jacobi integral for the translated system.",
