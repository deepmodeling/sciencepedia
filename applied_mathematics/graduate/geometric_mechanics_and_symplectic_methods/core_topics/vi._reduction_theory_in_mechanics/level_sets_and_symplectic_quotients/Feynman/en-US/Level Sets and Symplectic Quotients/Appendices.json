            "solution": "We begin with the basic definitions in canonical Hamiltonian mechanics. On $(\\mathbb{R}^{2n},\\omega_0)$ with coordinates $(q,p)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, the standard symplectic form is $\\omega_0=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} dq_i\\wedge dp_i$. For a smooth Hamiltonian $H:\\mathbb{R}^{2n}\\to\\mathbb{R}$, the Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ is defined by the interior product relation $i_{X_H}\\omega_0=dH$. In canonical coordinates, this yields Hamilton’s equations\n$$\n\\dot{q}=\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p},\\qquad \\dot{p}=-\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q},\n$$\nor equivalently, with the standard symplectic matrix $J=\\begin{pmatrix}0I_n\\\\-I_n0\\end{pmatrix}$ and the Euclidean gradient $\\nabla H$, the compact form $X_H=J\\nabla H$.\n\nFor the quadratic Hamiltonian $H(q,p)=p^{\\top}A\\,p+q^{\\top}B\\,q$ with $A,B$ symmetric, we compute the gradients\n$$\n\\nabla_q H=2B\\,q,\\qquad \\nabla_p H=2A\\,p,\n$$\nusing $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}(q^{\\top}B\\,q)=2Bq$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}(p^{\\top}A\\,p)=2Ap$ when $A,B$ are symmetric.

Since $AB$ and $BA$ have the same nonzero spectrum, one may parameterize by $\\mu\\in\\operatorname{spec}(AB)$. Then each $\\mu$ contributes eigenvalues of $M$ via\n$$\n\\lambda=\\pm 2\\sqrt{\\mu}\\,i\\quad\\text{if }\\mu0,\\qquad \\lambda=\\pm 2\\sqrt{|\\mu|}\\quad\\text{if }\\mu0,\n$$\nand more generally for complex $\\mu$, $\\lambda$ comes in the Hamiltonian quadruples $\\{\\lambda,-\\lambda,\\overline{\\lambda},-\\overline{\\lambda}\\}$. In particular:\n- If $A$ and $B$ are symmetric positive definite, then $AB$ is similar to the symmetric positive definite matrix $A^{1/2}BA^{1/2}$; thus $\\operatorname{spec}(AB)\\subset(0,\\infty)$ and all eigenvalues of $M$ are purely imaginary.

The set $\\Sigma_E$ is a smooth compact hypersurface that is an ellipsoid in $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, diffeomorphic to the sphere $S^{2n-1}$.

The Hamiltonian flow is a uniform phase rotation $w(t)=\\exp\\big(i\\,2\\sqrt{\\alpha\\beta}\\,t\\big)\\,w(0)$, generating a free $\\mathrm{S}^1$ action on $\\Sigma_E$. The corresponding momentum map for the $\\mathrm{S}^1$ action is (a positive multiple of) $H$, so Marsden–Weinstein reduction at energy $E$ yields the symplectic quotient\n$$\n\\Sigma_E/\\mathrm{S}^1\\cong \\mathbb{C}\\mathrm{P}^{n-1}\n$$\nequipped with the Fubini–Study symplectic form scaled so that its total symplectic volume matches that of the reduced level set; concretely, the induced symplectic form is proportional to the standard Fubini–Study form with scale set by $E$ and the parameters $\\alpha,\\beta$.\n\nFinally, we compute the exact linear Hamiltonian flow map $\\Phi_t=\\exp(tM)$. Using the functional calculus for matrices and the power-series definition of the matrix exponential, decompose into even and odd powers of $M$:\n$$\n\\exp(tM)=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{t^{2k}M^{2k}}{(2k)!}+\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{t^{2k+1}M^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!}.\n$$\nFrom $M^2=\\operatorname{diag}(-4AB,-4BA)$ and the identity $M^{2k+1}=M(M^2)^k$, we obtain the block form\n$$\n\\exp(tM)=\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\dfrac{(-4AB)^k\\,t^{2k}}{(2k)!}  \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\dfrac{2A\\,(-4BA)^k\\,t^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!} \\\\\n\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\dfrac{-2B\\,(-4AB)^k\\,t^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!}  \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\dfrac{(-4BA)^k\\,t^{2k}}{(2k)!}\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nUnder the assumption that $A$ and $B$ are symmetric positive definite, the principal square roots $\\sqrt{AB}$ and $\\sqrt{BA}$ are well defined and the above series identify with operator-valued trigonometric functions.

The level set $S_{2\\sigma}$ is precisely the level set $H^{-1}(\\sigma)$.\n\nWe can consider the product group $G = T^2 \\times S^1$ acting on $\\mathbb{C}^4$. This action is Hamiltonian with a moment map $\\mathcal{J}: \\mathbb{C}^4 \\to \\mathfrak{g}^* \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3$ given by $\\mathcal{J}(z) = (J(z), H(z))$. The space $\\mathbb{C}^4$ is a connected symplectic manifold.\n\nA foundational result in symplectic geometry, due to Kirwan (and for abelian groups, Atiyah and Guillemin-Sternberg), states that for a Hamiltonian action of a compact Lie group on a connected symplectic manifold, the preimage of any convex subset of the dual of the Lie algebra is connected.\n\nThe fiber we are interested in is $J^{-1}(\\mu) \\cap S_{2\\sigma} = J^{-1}(\\mu) \\cap H^{-1}(\\sigma)$. This is precisely the preimage $\\mathcal{J}^{-1}(\\mu, \\sigma)$ of the point $(\\mu, \\sigma) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. A single point is a convex set. Therefore, by the aforementioned theorem, the fiber $J^{-1}(\\mu) \\cap S_{2\\sigma}$ is connected for any $(\\mu, \\sigma)$ for which it is non-empty. The condition $\\mu \\in \\operatorname{int}(J(S_{2\\sigma}))$ ensures the fiber is non-empty.\n\n**Connectedness of the Symplectic Quotient $J^{-1}(\\mu)/T^2$**\n\nThe symplectic quotient $M_\\mu = J^{-1}(\\mu)/T^2$ is formed by taking the quotient of the level set of the moment map $J$ by the group action. Its connectedness is deduced from the connectedness of the level set $J^{-1}(\\mu)$ itself.\n\nThe Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg connectedness theorem states that for a Hamiltonian action of a torus on a connected symplectic manifold, the level sets of the moment map are connected. In this case, the group is $T^2$ and the manifold is $\\mathbb{C}^4$, which is connected. Thus, for any value $\\mu$ in the image of $J$, the level set $J^{-1}(\\mu)$ is a connected subspace of $\\mathbb{C}^4$.\n\nThe symplectic quotient $M_\\mu = J^{-1}(\\mu)/T^2$ is the space of orbits of $T^2$ in the level set $J^{-1}(\\mu)$. Topologically, this is a quotient space obtained from the connected space $J^{-1}(\\mu)$ by an equivalence relation (belonging to the same orbit). A fundamental property of topological spaces is that the quotient of a connected space is always connected.\n\nTherefore, because $J^{-1}(\\mu)$ is connected, the quotient space $M_\\mu = J^{-1}(\\mu)/T^2$ is also connected. The condition that $\\mu$ is a regular value ensures that $M_\\mu$ is a smooth manifold, but the property of connectedness holds more generally.",
