            "solution": "The problem statement is a standard exercise in differential geometry and is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and internally consistent. We can therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe real projective space $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is defined as the quotient of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ by the action of the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{R}^* = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, where the action is scalar multiplication. A point in $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is an equivalence class $[x]$, representing the line through the origin and the point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. Any such line intersects the unit sphere $S^n = \\{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\mid \\|y\\|=1\\}$ at exactly two antipodal points, $\\{y, -y\\}$. This provides a canonical identification of $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ with the quotient space $S^n / \\sim$, where $y \\sim -y$. This equivalence relation is induced by a group action, which we will use to establish the manifold structure.\n\n**Part 1: Justification as a Smooth Manifold**\n\nWe model $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ as the quotient of the $n$-sphere $S^n$ by the action of the group $G = \\mathbb{Z}_2 = \\{1, -1\\}$.\nThe manifold is $M = S^n$, which is a smooth, compact, embedded submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ of dimension $n$.\nThe group is $G = \\mathbb{Z}_2$. As a finite group, it is a $0$-dimensional Lie group.\nThe action of $G$ on $M$ is given by multiplication: for $g \\in G$ and $x \\in S^n$, the action is $(g, x) \\mapsto g \\cdot x$. Explicitly, $1 \\cdot x = x$ and $(-1) \\cdot x = -x$. This action is smooth, as it is the restriction of the smooth scalar multiplication map on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.\n\nTo show that the quotient space $\\mathbb{RP}^n \\cong S^n / G$ is a smooth manifold, we invoke the Quotient Manifold Theorem. The theorem states that if a Lie group $G$ acts smoothly, freely, and properly on a smooth manifold $M$, then the orbit space $M/G$ has a unique smooth manifold structure such that the canonical projection $\\pi: M \\to M/G$ is a smooth submersion. We must verify that the action is free and proper.\n\n1.  **Free Action**: An action is free if the stabilizer of every point is trivial. That is, for any $x \\in S^n$, if $g \\cdot x = x$ for some $g \\in G$, then $g$ must be the identity element, $g=1$.\n    If $g = -1$, the condition is $-x = x$, which implies $x = 0$. However, $x \\in S^n$, so $\\|x\\|=1$ and $x \\neq 0$. Thus, the only element of $G$ that fixes any point in $S^n$ is the identity element $g=1$. The action is therefore free.\n\n2.  **Proper Action**: A continuous action of a group $G$ on a topological space $M$ is proper if the map $\\Psi: G \\times M \\to M \\times M$ given by $\\Psi(g, x) = (x, g \\cdot x)$ is a proper map (the inverse image of any compact set is compact). A sufficient condition for an action to be proper is if the group $G$ is compact and the space $M$ is Hausdorff. Here, $G = \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is a finite group, so it is compact. The sphere $S^n$ is a subspace of a Euclidean space, so it is Hausdorff. Therefore, the action of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ on $S^n$ is proper.\n\nSince the action of $G = \\mathbb{Z}_2$ on $M = S^n$ is smooth, free, and proper, the Quotient Manifold Theorem guarantees that $\\mathbb{RP}^n = S^n / \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is a smooth manifold. The projection map $\\pi: S^n \\to \\mathbb{RP}^n$, given by $\\pi(x) = [x] = \\{x, -x\\}$, is a local diffeomorphism.\n\n**Part 2: Construction of a Smooth Atlas**\n\nWe construct a smooth atlas for $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ using homogeneous coordinates. A point in $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is an equivalence class $[x_0: x_1: \\dots: x_n]$, where not all $x_i$ are zero, and $[x_0: \\dots: x_n] = [\\lambda x_0: \\dots: \\lambda x_n]$ for any $\\lambda \\neq 0$.\n\nFor each $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$, we define an open set $U_i \\subset \\mathbb{RP}^n$ by:\n$$U_i = \\{ [x_0: \\dots: x_n] \\in \\mathbb{RP}^n \\mid x_i \\neq 0 \\}$$\nThese sets are open because their preimages under the quotient map $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\setminus \\{0\\} \\to \\mathbb{RP}^n$, which are $\\pi^{-1}(U_i) = \\{ (x_0, \\dots, x_n) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\setminus \\{0\\} \\mid x_i \\neq 0 \\}$, are open. The collection $\\{U_i\\}_{i=0}^n$ forms a cover of $\\mathbb{RP}^n$, since for any point $[x]$, at least one coordinate $x_i$ must be non-zero.\n\nNext, we define the chart maps $\\phi_i: U_i \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ for each $i$. For a point $[x_0: \\dots: x_n] \\in U_i$, we have $x_i \\ne 0$. The map is defined by dividing all coordinates by $x_i$ and omitting the $i$-th coordinate (which becomes $1$):\n$$\\phi_i([x_0: \\dots: x_n]) = \\left( \\frac{x_0}{x_i}, \\dots, \\frac{x_{i-1}}{x_i}, \\frac{x_{i+1}}{x_i}, \\dots, \\frac{x_n}{x_i} \\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$$\nThis map is well-defined because if we use a different representative $[\\lambda x]$ with $\\lambda \\neq 0$, the ratios $\\frac{\\lambda x_j}{\\lambda x_i} = \\frac{x_j}{x_i}$ remain unchanged.\n\nThe inverse map $\\phi_i^{-1}: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to U_i$ takes a point from $\\mathbb{R}^n$, which we denote by a tuple $(u_0, \\dots, u_{i-1}, u_{i+1}, \\dots, u_n)$, and re-inserts a $1$ at the $i$-th position to form a homogeneous coordinate:\n$$\\phi_i^{-1}(u_0, \\dots, u_{i-1}, u_{i+1}, \\dots, u_n) = [u_0: \\dots: u_{i-1}: 1: u_{i+1}: \\dots: u_n]$$\nThese maps are homeomorphisms between $U_i$ and $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nTo verify that this collection of charts $\\{(U_i, \\phi_i)\\}_{i=0}^n$ forms a smooth atlas, we must check that the transition maps are smooth. Consider two charts $(U_i, \\phi_i)$ and $(U_j, \\phi_j)$ with $i \\neq j$. The transition map is $\\phi_j \\circ \\phi_i^{-1}$, defined on the open set $\\phi_i(U_i \\cap U_j)$.\n\nThe intersection is $U_i \\cap U_j = \\{[x] \\in \\mathbb{RP}^n \\mid x_i \\neq 0 \\text{ and } x_j \\neq 0\\}$.\nThe domain of the transition map is $\\phi_i(U_i \\cap U_j)$. An element in this set is of the form $u = \\phi_i([x])$ where $x_j \\neq 0$. In terms of the coordinates of $u = (u_k)_{k \\neq i}$, where $u_k = x_k/x_i$, the condition $x_j \\neq 0$ is equivalent to $u_j = x_j/x_i \\neq 0$. So, the domain is $\\{ u \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid u_j \\neq 0 \\}$, which is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nLet $u = (u_k)_{k \\neq i}$ be a point in this domain. First, we apply $\\phi_i^{-1}$:\n$$\\phi_i^{-1}(u) = [u_0: \\dots: u_{i-1}: 1: u_{i+1}: \\dots: u_n]$$\nLet's call the representative homogeneous coordinate vector $v$. So $v_k = u_k$ for $k \\neq i$, and $v_i = 1$.\nNow we apply $\\phi_j$:\n$$\\phi_j([v]) = \\left( \\frac{v_0}{v_j}, \\dots, \\frac{v_{j-1}}{v_j}, \\frac{v_{j+1}}{v_j}, \\dots, \\frac{v_n}{v_j} \\right)$$\nLet the resulting vector in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ be $w = (w_k)_{k \\neq j}$. Its components are given by $w_k = v_k/v_j$. We express $w$ in terms of $u$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item For $k \\neq i$ and $k \\neq j$: $w_k = \\frac{v_k}{v_j} = \\frac{u_k}{u_j}$.\n    \\item For $k = i$ (this component exists in $w$ since $i \\neq j$): $w_i = \\frac{v_i}{v_j} = \\frac{1}{u_j}$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe map $\\phi_j \\circ \\phi_i^{-1}$ is given by:\n$$u = (u_k)_{k\\neq i} \\mapsto w = (w_k)_{k\\neq j}$$\nwhere the components $w_k$ are rational functions of the components $u_k$. The only denominator is $u_j$, which is non-zero on the domain $\\phi_i(U_i \\cap U_j)$. Therefore, the transition map is a smooth ($C^\\infty$) function from an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\nThis holds for any pair $(i, j)$, so the atlas is a smooth atlas.\n\n**Part 3: Dimension of $\\mathbb{RP}^n$**\n\nThe dimension of a smooth manifold is defined as the dimension of the Euclidean space to which its chart domains are mapped. In the atlas we constructed, each chart map $\\phi_i$ is a map from an open set $U_i \\subset \\mathbb{RP}^n$ to $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The codomain of each chart map is $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The dimension of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is $n$.\nTherefore, the dimension of the real projective space $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is $n$.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the established mathematical theory of Lie groups and Riemannian geometry, it is well-posed, objective, and internally consistent.\n\nThe problem asks for two parts: first, to provide the standard spherical coordinate parametrization for the $2$-sphere $S^{2}$, and second, to compute the scaling factor $\\lambda$ for the Riemannian metric on $S^{2}$ induced from the bi-invariant metric on $SO(3)$.\n\n**Part 1: Parametrization of $S^{2}$**\n\nThe $2$-sphere $S^{2}$ is the set of points in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ at unit distance from the origin. We use standard spherical coordinates $(\\theta, \\varphi)$, where $\\theta \\in (0,\\pi)$ is the polar angle measured from the positive $z$-axis and $\\varphi \\in (0,2\\pi)$ is the azimuthal angle in the $xy$-plane from the positive $x$-axis.

This means that for any point $p \\in S^2$ and any pair of tangent vectors $u, v \\in T_p S^2$, their inner product is given by\n$$\ng_{S^2}(u, v)_p = g_{G}(\\tilde{u}, \\tilde{v})_R\n$$\nwhere $R$ is any element in $G$ such that $\\pi(R) = p$, and $\\tilde{u}, \\tilde{v}$ are the unique horizontal lifts of $u, v$ to the tangent space $T_R G$. The horizontal space $\\mathcal{H}_R$ is the orthogonal complement of the vertical space $\\mathcal{V}_R = \\ker(d\\pi_R)$ with respect to the metric $g_G$.\n\nThe metric on $G=SO(3)$ is left-invariant, originating from the inner product $\\langle A, B \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{tr}(AB)$ on the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(3) = T_e G$. The vertical space at the identity, $\\mathcal{V}_e$, is the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{h}$ of the subgroup $H=SO(2)$. The horizontal space at the identity, $\\mathcal{H}_e$, is the orthogonal complement of $\\mathfrak{h}$ in $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$. Due to the left-invariance of the metric, the horizontal space at any $R \\in G$ is $\\mathcal{H}_R = dL_R(\\mathcal{H}_e)$, where $L_R$ is left multiplication by $R$.\n\nThe differential of $\\pi$ at an element $R \\in G$ applied to a vector $Y = dL_R(A) \\in T_R G$ (for $A \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$) is $d\\pi_R(Y) = \\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0} \\pi(R\\exp(tA)) = R(A e_3)$.\nA vector $Y=dL_R(A)$ is a horizontal lift of $u \\in T_p S^2$ if $A \\in \\mathcal{H}_e$ and $d\\pi_R(Y) = u$.

The standard basis for $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$ consists of the infinitesimal generators of rotations about the coordinate axes:\n$$\nL_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad L_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad L_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$H=SO(2)$ is the group of rotations about the $z$-axis, so its Lie algebra is $\\mathfrak{h} = \\operatorname{span}\\{L_3\\}$. This is the vertical subalgebra $\\mathcal{V}_e$.\nThe horizontal subalgebra $\\mathcal{H}_e$ is the orthogonal complement of $\\mathfrak{h}$. For any $A \\in \\mathfrak{h}$ and $B \\in \\mathcal{H}_e$, we must have $\\langle A, B \\rangle = 0$. The basis $\\{L_1, L_2, L_3\\}$ is orthonormal with respect to the given inner product:\n$$\n\\langle L_i, L_j \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{tr}(L_i L_j) = \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nFor instance, $\\langle L_1, L_1 \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{tr}(L_1^2) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{tr}\\left(\\operatorname{diag}(0, -1, -1)\\right) = 1$. The orthogonality, e.g. $\\langle L_1, L_2 \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{tr}(L_1 L_2) = 0$, can be checked similarly.\nThus, $\\mathcal{H}_e = \\operatorname{span}\\{L_1, L_2\\}$.\n\nTo find $\\lambda$, we compute the metric components at a convenient, non-singular point. Let's choose the point $p = (1,0,0) \\in S^2$, which corresponds to coordinates $(\\theta, \\varphi) = (\\pi/2, 0)$. The tangent vectors for the coordinate system at this point are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial \\theta}\\bigg|_{(\\pi/2, 0)} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\pi/2)\\cos(0) \\\\ \\cos(\\pi/2)\\sin(0) \\\\ -\\sin(\\pi/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = -e_3\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial \\varphi}\\bigg|_{(\\pi/2, 0)} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin(\\pi/2)\\sin(0) \\\\ \\sin(\\pi/2)\\cos(0) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = e_2\n$$\nThe metric components are $g_{\\theta\\theta} = g_{S^2}(-e_3, -e_3)_p$, $g_{\\varphi\\varphi} = g_{S^2}(e_2, e_2)_p$, and $g_{\\theta\\varphi} = g_{S^2}(-e_3, e_2)_p$.\n\nWe need an $R \\in SO(3)$ such that $\\pi(R) = R e_3 = p = e_1$. A rotation by $\\pi/2$ about the $y$-axis works:\n$$\nR = R_y(\\pi/2) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\pi/2) & 0 & \\sin(\\pi/2) \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -\\sin(\\pi/2) & 0 & \\cos(\\pi/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIndeed, $R e_3 = (1,0,0)^T = e_1 = p$.\n\nNow we find the horizontal pre-images in $\\mathcal{H}_e = \\operatorname{span}\\{L_1, L_2\\}$ for our tangent vectors.\nFor $u = -e_3$, we seek $A \\in \\mathcal{H}_e$ such that $R A e_3 = -e_3$. Let $A = c_1 L_1 + c_2 L_2$.\n$A e_3 = c_1(L_1 e_3) + c_2(L_2 e_3) = c_1(-e_2) + c_2(e_1) = (c_2, -c_1, 0)^T$.\n$R(A e_3) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c_2 \\\\ -c_1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -c_1 \\\\ -c_2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nWe set this equal to $-e_3 = (0,0,-1)^T$, which gives $-c_1 = 0$ and $-c_2 = -1$, so $c_1=0, c_2=1$. The pre-image is $A = L_2$.\nThe metric component is $g_{\\theta\\theta} = \\langle A, A \\rangle = \\langle L_2, L_2 \\rangle = 1$.\n\nFor $v = e_2$, we seek $B \\in \\mathcal{H}_e$ such that $R B e_3 = e_2$. Let $B = d_1 L_1 + d_2 L_2$.\n$R(B e_3) = (0, -d_1, -d_2)^T$.\nWe set this equal to $e_2 = (0,1,0)^T$, which gives $-d_1 = 1$ and $-d_2=0$, so $d_1=-1, d_2=0$. The pre-image is $B = -L_1$.\nThe metric component is $g_{\\varphi\\varphi} = \\langle B, B \\rangle = \\langle -L_1, -L_1 \\rangle = \\langle L_1, L_1 \\rangle = 1$.\n\nThe off-diagonal component is $g_{\\theta\\varphi} = \\langle A, B \\rangle = \\langle L_2, -L_1 \\rangle = -\\langle L_2, L_1 \\rangle = 0$ due to orthogonality.\n\nSo at $(\\theta, \\varphi) = (\\pi/2, 0)$, the metric is $ds^2 = g_{\\theta\\theta}d\\theta^2 + g_{\\varphi\\varphi}d\\varphi^2 = 1 \\cdot d\\theta^2 + 1 \\cdot d\\varphi^2$.\nWe compare this to the asserted general form $g = \\lambda (d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta d\\varphi^2)$. At $\\theta = \\pi/2$, $\\sin\\theta = 1$, so this form becomes $g = \\lambda (d\\theta^2 + d\\varphi^2)$.\nComparing our computed metric with this expression, we find $1 \\cdot (d\\theta^2 + d\\varphi^2) = \\lambda (d\\theta^2 + d\\varphi^2)$, which implies $\\lambda=1$.\nSince the metric on $SO(3)$ is bi-invariant and the action of $SO(3)$ on $S^2$ is transitive, the induced metric is $SO(3)$-invariant. The unique (up to scaling) $SO(3)$-invariant metric on $S^2$ is the standard round metric. Therefore, the constant $\\lambda$ determined at one point is valid for the entire sphere. The specific normalization $\\langle A, B \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{tr}(AB)$ on $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$ is precisely what yields the standard unit sphere metric on $S^2$, for which $\\lambda=1$.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for a detailed analysis of the Kostant–Kirillov–Souriau (KKS) symplectic form on a coadjoint orbit of the Lie group $G = \\mathrm{SO}(3)$. We will address a sequence of tasks leading to the determinant of the matrix representation of this form in spherical coordinates.\n\nThe group is $G = \\mathrm{SO}(3)$, with Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{so}(3)$. We are given the identification $\\mathfrak{g} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3$, where the Lie bracket corresponds to the cross product, $[\\xi, \\eta] = \\xi \\times \\eta$ for $\\xi, \\eta \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. The dual space $\\mathfrak{g}^*$ is also identified with $\\mathbb{R}^3$, and the dual pairing is the dot product, $\\langle \\mu, \\xi \\rangle = \\mu \\cdot \\xi$. The coadjoint action $\\mathrm{Ad}^*_g(\\mu)$ is the standard rotation of the vector $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ by the matrix $g \\in \\mathrm{SO}(3)$. The coadjoint orbit $\\mathcal{O}_\\mu$ of a vector $\\mu$ with magnitude $|\\mu|=r>0$ is the sphere of radius $r$, denoted $\\mathbb{S}^2_r$.\n\n**1. Fundamental Vector Field and Tangent Space**\n\nThe fundamental vector field $\\xi_{\\mathfrak{g}^{*}}(\\nu)$ on the manifold $\\mathfrak{g}^{*} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3$ corresponding to an element $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ is defined by the flow of the coadjoint action. At a point $\\nu \\in \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$, it is given by:\n$$\n\\xi_{\\mathfrak{g}^{*}}(\\nu) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\mathrm{Ad}^*_{\\exp(t\\xi)}(\\nu)\n$$\nThe coadjoint action is given as $\\mathrm{Ad}^*_g(\\nu) = g\\nu$. The matrix exponential $\\exp(t\\xi)$ for $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3$ corresponds to a rotation. For an infinitesimal time $t$, the rotation matrix is approximately the identity plus an infinitesimal rotation generator. The action of this generator on a vector $\\nu$ is the cross product.\n$$\n\\exp(t\\xi)\\nu \\approx (I + t\\hat{\\xi})\\nu = \\nu + t(\\xi \\times \\nu)\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\xi}$ is the skew-symmetric matrix corresponding to $\\xi$.\nTherefore, the fundamental vector field is:\n$$\n\\xi_{\\mathfrak{g}^{*}}(\\nu) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} (\\nu + t(\\xi \\times \\nu)) = \\xi \\times \\nu\n$$\nThe tangent space $T_{\\nu}\\mathcal{O}_{\\mu}$ to the coadjoint orbit $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mu} = \\mathbb{S}^2_r$ at a point $\\nu$ is spanned by the fundamental vector fields evaluated at $\\nu$.\n$$\nT_{\\nu}\\mathcal{O}_{\\mu} = \\{ \\xi_{\\mathfrak{g}^{*}}(\\nu) \\mid \\xi \\in \\mathfrak{g} \\} = \\{ \\xi \\times \\nu \\mid \\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\}\n$$\nFor any $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, the vector $\\xi \\times \\nu$ is orthogonal to $\\nu$. Thus, the tangent space $T_{\\nu}\\mathcal{O}_{\\mu}$ is the set of all vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ orthogonal to $\\nu$. This is the tangent plane to the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^2_r$ at the point $\\nu$.\n\n**2. Well-definedness of the KKS form**\n\nThe KKS form is defined on $T_{\\nu}\\mathcal{O}_{\\mu}$ by:\n$$\n\\omega_{\\nu}\\big(\\xi_{\\mathfrak{g}^{*}}(\\nu), \\eta_{\\mathfrak{g}^{*}}(\\nu)\\big) = \\langle \\nu, [\\xi, \\eta] \\rangle\n$$\nFor this form to be well-defined, its value must be independent of the choice of $\\xi, \\eta \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ that generate the tangent vectors. Let $v_1 = \\xi_{\\mathfrak{g}^{*}}(\\nu)$ and $v_2 = \\eta_{\\mathfrak{g}^{*}}(\\nu)$. Suppose other elements $\\xi', \\eta' \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ generate the same tangent vectors, i.e., $\\xi'_{\\mathfrak{g}^{*}}(\\nu) = v_1$ and $\\eta'_{\\mathfrak{g}^{*}}(\\nu) = v_2$.\nThis implies $(\\xi' - \\xi) \\times \\nu = 0$ and $(\\eta' - \\eta) \\times \\nu = 0$. This means $\\xi' - \\xi$ and $\\eta' - \\eta$ are parallel to $\\nu$. The set of elements $\\zeta \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ such that $\\zeta \\times \\nu = 0$ is the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}_{\\nu}$ of the stabilizer subgroup $G_{\\nu}$ of $\\nu$. Thus, $\\xi' = \\xi + \\zeta_1$ and $\\eta' = \\eta + \\zeta_2$ for some $\\zeta_1, \\zeta_2 \\in \\mathfrak{g}_{\\nu}$.\n\nWe must show that $\\langle \\nu, [\\xi', \\eta'] \\rangle = \\langle \\nu, [\\xi, \\eta] \\rangle$.\n$$\n\\langle \\nu, [\\xi', \\eta'] \\rangle = \\langle \\nu, [\\xi + \\zeta_1, \\eta + \\zeta_2] \\rangle = \\langle \\nu, [\\xi, \\eta] + [\\xi, \\zeta_2] + [\\zeta_1, \\eta] + [\\zeta_1, \\zeta_2] \\rangle\n$$\nUsing the property of the pairing and the Lie bracket, $\\langle \\mu, [X, Y] \\rangle = -\\langle \\mu, [Y, X] \\rangle$, and the definition of the coadjoint action $\\langle \\mathrm{ad}^*_X \\mu, Y \\rangle = \\langle \\mu, [X, Y] \\rangle$, we have:\n$\\langle \\nu, [\\zeta_1, \\eta] \\rangle = \\langle \\mathrm{ad}^*_{\\zeta_1} \\nu, \\eta \\rangle$. Since $\\zeta_1 \\in \\mathfrak{g}_{\\nu}$, its infinitesimal action on $\\nu$ is zero: $\\mathrm{ad}^*_{\\zeta_1} \\nu = \\zeta_1 \\times \\nu = 0$. So, $\\langle \\nu, [\\zeta_1, \\eta] \\rangle = 0$.\nSimilarly, $\\langle \\nu, [\\xi, \\zeta_2] \\rangle = -\\langle \\nu, [\\zeta_2, \\xi] \\rangle = -\\langle \\mathrm{ad}^*_{\\zeta_2} \\nu, \\xi \\rangle = 0$.\nThe term $\\langle \\nu, [\\zeta_1, \\zeta_2] \\rangle$ is also zero.\nThus, $\\langle \\nu, [\\xi', \\eta'] \\rangle = \\langle \\nu, [\\xi, \\eta] \\rangle$, which proves the form is well-defined. The smoothness of $\\omega$ follows from the smoothness of $\\nu$ on the orbit and the bilinear nature of the dot product and Lie bracket.\n\n**3. KKS form in Spherical Coordinates**\n\nThe sphere $\\mathbb{S}^2_r$ is parametrized by $\\nu(\\theta,\\phi) = r(\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$. The tangent vectors of the coordinate basis are:\n$$\n\\partial_{\\theta} = \\frac{\\partial\\nu}{\\partial\\theta} = r(\\cos\\theta\\cos\\phi, \\cos\\theta\\sin\\phi, -\\sin\\theta)\n$$\n$$\n\\partial_{\\phi} = \\frac{\\partial\\nu}{\\partial\\phi} = r(-\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi, \\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi, 0)\n$$\nTo compute $\\omega_{\\nu}(\\partial_{\\theta}, \\partial_{\\phi})$, we must find $\\xi, \\eta \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ such that $\\partial_{\\theta} = \\xi \\times \\nu$ and $\\partial_{\\phi} = \\eta \\times \\nu$.\nA solution for an equation of the form $A = X \\times B$ is $X = (B \\times A) / |B|^2$. Since the choice of representative modulo $\\mathfrak{g}_\\nu$ does not matter, we can use this solution. Here, $|\\nu|^2 = r^2$.\nFor $\\xi$:\n$$\n\\xi = \\frac{\\nu \\times \\partial_{\\theta}}{r^2}\n$$\nThe components of $\\nu \\times \\partial_{\\theta}$ are:\n$(\\nu \\times \\partial_{\\theta})_x = r^2(\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi(-\\sin\\theta) - \\cos\\theta(\\cos\\theta\\sin\\phi)) = -r^2\\sin\\phi(\\sin^2\\theta+\\cos^2\\theta) = -r^2\\sin\\phi$\n$(\\nu \\times \\partial_{\\theta})_y = r^2(\\cos\\theta(\\cos\\theta\\cos\\phi) - \\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi(-\\sin\\theta)) = r^2\\cos\\phi(\\cos^2\\theta+\\sin^2\\theta) = r^2\\cos\\phi$\n$(\\nu \\times \\partial_{\\theta})_z = r^2(\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi(\\cos\\theta\\sin\\phi) - \\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi(\\cos\\theta\\cos\\phi)) = 0$\nSo, $\\xi = (-\\sin\\phi, \\cos\\phi, 0)$.\n\nFor $\\eta$:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{\\nu \\times \\partial_{\\phi}}{r^2}\n$$\nThe components of $\\nu \\times \\partial_{\\phi}$ are:\n$(\\nu \\times \\partial_{\\phi})_x = r^2(\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi(0) - \\cos\\theta(\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi)) = -r^2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta\\cos\\phi$\n$(\\nu \\times \\partial_{\\phi})_y = r^2(\\cos\\theta(-\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi) - \\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi(0)) = -r^2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta\\sin\\phi$\n$(\\nu \\times \\partial_{\\phi})_z = r^2(\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi(\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi) - \\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi(-\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi)) = r^2\\sin^2\\theta(\\cos^2\\phi+\\sin^2\\phi) = r^2\\sin^2\\theta$\nSo, $\\eta = (-\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta\\cos\\phi, -\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta\\sin\\phi, \\sin^2\\theta)$.\n\nNow we compute $\\omega_{\\nu}(\\partial_{\\theta}, \\partial_{\\phi}) = \\langle \\nu, [\\xi, \\eta] \\rangle = \\nu \\cdot (\\xi \\times \\eta)$. First, the cross product $\\xi \\times \\eta$:\n$$\n\\xi \\times \\eta =\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n\\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\\n-\\sin\\phi & \\cos\\phi & 0 \\\\\n-\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta\\cos\\phi & -\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta\\sin\\phi & \\sin^2\\theta\n\\end{vmatrix}\n$$\n$(\\xi \\times \\eta)_x = \\cos\\phi(\\sin^2\\theta) - 0 = \\sin^2\\theta\\cos\\phi$\n$(\\xi \\times \\eta)_y = 0 - (-\\sin\\phi)(\\sin^2\\theta) = \\sin^2\\theta\\sin\\phi$\n$(\\xi \\times \\eta)_z = (-\\sin\\phi)(-\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta\\sin\\phi) - (\\cos\\phi)(-\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta\\cos\\phi) = \\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta(\\sin^2\\phi+\\cos^2\\phi) = \\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$\nSo, $\\xi \\times \\eta = (\\sin^2\\theta\\cos\\phi, \\sin^2\\theta\\sin\\phi, \\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta)$.\n\nFinally, we compute the dot product with $\\nu = r(\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$:\n$$\n\\nu \\cdot (\\xi \\times \\eta) = r(\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi)(\\sin^2\\theta\\cos\\phi) + r(\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi)(\\sin^2\\theta\\sin\\phi) + r(\\cos\\theta)(\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta)\n$$\n$$\n= r\\sin^3\\theta(\\cos^2\\phi+\\sin^2\\phi) + r\\sin\\theta\\cos^2\\theta = r(\\sin^3\\theta + \\sin\\theta\\cos^2\\theta) = r\\sin\\theta(\\sin^2\\theta+\\cos^2\\theta) = r\\sin\\theta\n$$\nThus, we have shown that $\\omega(\\partial_{\\theta}, \\partial_{\\phi}) = r\\sin\\theta$.\n\n**4. Matrix and Determinant of $\\omega$**\n\nThe KKS form $\\omega$ is a $2$-form, and hence it is skew-symmetric. In the basis $\\{\\partial_{\\theta}, \\partial_{\\phi}\\}$, its associated matrix $\\Omega$ has components $\\Omega_{ij} = \\omega(e_i, e_j)$ where $e_1=\\partial_{\\theta}$ and $e_2=\\partial_{\\phi}$.\nThe components are:\n$\\Omega_{11} = \\omega(\\partial_{\\theta}, \\partial_{\\theta}) = 0$\n$\\Omega_{22} = \\omega(\\partial_{\\phi}, \\partial_{\\phi}) = 0$\n$\\Omega_{12} = \\omega(\\partial_{\\theta}, \\partial_{\\phi}) = r\\sin\\theta$\n$\\Omega_{21} = \\omega(\\partial_{\\phi}, \\partial_{\\theta}) = -\\omega(\\partial_{\\theta}, \\partial_{\\phi}) = -r\\sin\\theta$\nThe matrix of the bilinear form is:\n$$\n\\Omega = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & r\\sin\\theta \\\\ -r\\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n$$\n\\det(\\Omega) = (0)(0) - (r\\sin\\theta)(-r\\sin\\theta) = r^2\\sin^2\\theta\n$$\nThis determinant is non-zero whenever $r>0$ and $\\sin\\theta \\neq 0$, which corresponds to the points on the sphere where the spherical coordinate system is not singular (i.e., away from the poles $\\theta=0$ and $\\theta=\\pi$). This confirms the non-degeneracy of the KKS form on the regular part of the coordinate chart.",
