It presents a standard problem in geometric mechanics, namely the derivation of the reduced Hamiltonian for a system with symmetry. The provided information is sufficient and consistent. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed to its solution.\n\nThe derivation of the reduced Hamiltonian $H_{\\mu}$ from first principles involves three main stages: first, constructing the canonical Hamiltonian on the full phase space $T^{*}S^{2}$ via the Legendre transform; second, identifying the momentum map $J$ associated with the given $SO(2)$ symmetry; and third, performing the reduction by restricting the Hamiltonian to the level set $J=\\mu$ and projecting it onto the reduced phase space.\n\n**1. Canonical Momenta and the Hamiltonian**\n\nThe configuration space is the sphere $S^{2}$, with generalized coordinates $q = (\\theta, \\phi)$. The Lagrangian is given as:\n$$\nL(q, \\dot{q}) = L(\\theta, \\phi, \\dot{\\theta}, \\dot{\\phi}) = \\frac{1}{2} m R^{2} (\\dot{\\theta}^{2} + \\sin^{2}\\theta \\, \\dot{\\phi}^{2}) - V(\\theta)\n$$\nThe canonical momenta, which are the coordinates on the cotangent fibers, are defined by the partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to the generalized velocities. The momentum conjugate to $\\theta$ is $p_{\\theta}$, and the momentum conjugate to $\\phi$ is $p_{\\phi}$.\n\n$$\np_{\\theta} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} m R^{2} (\\dot{\\theta}^{2} + \\sin^{2}\\theta \\, \\dot{\\phi}^{2}) - V(\\theta) \\right] = mR^{2}\\dot{\\theta}\n$$\n$$\np_{\\phi} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\phi}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\dot{\\phi}} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} m R^{2} (\\dot{\\theta}^{2} + \\sin^{2}\\theta \\, \\dot{\\phi}^{2}) - V(\\theta) \\right] = mR^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta \\, \\dot{\\phi}\n$$\n\nThe canonical Hamiltonian $H$ is obtained through the Legendre transformation, $H(q, p) = \\sum_{i} p_i \\dot{q}_i - L(q, \\dot{q})$. Here, this becomes $H = p_{\\theta}\\dot{\\theta} + p_{\\phi}\\dot{\\phi} - L$. To express $H$ as a function on the phase space $T^{*}S^{2}$ (coordinatized by $(\\theta, \\phi, p_{\\theta}, p_{\\phi})$), we must first express the velocities in terms of the momenta:\n$$\n\\dot{\\theta} = \\frac{p_{\\theta}}{mR^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{\\phi} = \\frac{p_{\\phi}}{mR^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta}\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the definition of the Hamiltonian:\n$$\nH = p_{\\theta}\\left(\\frac{p_{\\theta}}{mR^{2}}\\right) + p_{\\phi}\\left(\\frac{p_{\\phi}}{mR^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta}\\right) - \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} m R^{2} \\left(\\left(\\frac{p_{\\theta}}{mR^{2}}\\right)^{2} + \\sin^{2}\\theta\\left(\\frac{p_{\\phi}}{mR^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta}\\right)^{2}\\right) - V(\\theta) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nH = \\frac{p_{\\theta}^{2}}{mR^{2}} + \\frac{p_{\\phi}^{2}}{mR^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta} - \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} m R^{2} \\left(\\frac{p_{\\theta}^{2}}{m^{2}R^{4}} + \\frac{p_{\\phi}^{2}}{m^{2}R^{4}\\sin^{2}\\theta}\\right) - V(\\theta) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nH = \\frac{p_{\\theta}^{2}}{mR^{2}} + \\frac{p_{\\phi}^{2}}{mR^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta} - \\left[ \\frac{p_{\\theta}^{2}}{2mR^{2}} + \\frac{p_{\\phi}^{2}}{2mR^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta} - V(\\theta) \\right]\n$$\nSimplifying the expression yields the canonical Hamiltonian on $T^{*}S^{2}$:\n$$\nH(\\theta, \\phi, p_{\\theta}, p_{\\phi}) = \\frac{p_{\\theta}^{2}}{2mR^{2}} + \\frac{p_{\\phi}^{2}}{2mR^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta} + V(\\theta)\n$$\n\n**2. Symmetry and the Momentum Map**\n\nThe system is symmetric under the action of the group $G=SO(2)$ by rotations about the vertical axis. This action on the configuration space is given by $\\phi \\mapsto \\phi + \\alpha$ for $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}/2\\pi\\mathbb{Z}$. The coordinate $\\phi$ is cyclic because the Lagrangian $L$ does not depend on it, $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\phi} = 0$. By Noether's theorem, this implies the conservation of the conjugate momentum, $p_{\\phi}$.\n\nIn the Hamiltonian framework, this conserved quantity is the value of the momentum map $J$ associated with the symmetry. For a cotangent-lifted action, the momentum map $J: T^{*}Q \\to \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$ (where $\\mathfrak{g}$ is the Lie algebra of $G$) is defined by the pairing $J(\\alpha_{q})(\\xi) = \\alpha_{q}(X_{\\xi}(q))$, where $\\alpha_{q} \\in T^{*}_{q}Q$ is a covector (a point in phase space), $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ is a Lie algebra element, and $X_{\\xi}$ is the fundamental vector field on $Q$ generated by $\\xi$.\n\nFor the $SO(2)$ action, the Lie algebra is $\\mathfrak{so}(2) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$. We can choose a basis element $\\xi = 1$. The corresponding fundamental vector field on $S^{2}$ is the generator of rotations in $\\phi$, which is $X_{\\xi} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}$. A point in the phase space $T^{*}S^{2}$ is given by its coordinates $(\\theta, \\phi, p_{\\theta}, p_{\\phi})$, which corresponds to the covector $\\alpha_{(\\theta, \\phi)} = p_{\\theta}d\\theta + p_{\\phi}d\\phi$.\n\nThe momentum map is therefore:\n$$\nJ = J(\\theta, \\phi, p_{\\theta}, p_{\\phi}) = \\langle p_{\\theta}d\\theta + p_{\\phi}d\\phi, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} \\rangle = p_{\\theta}d\\theta\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\right) + p_{\\phi}d\\phi\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\right) = p_{\\theta}(0) + p_{\\phi}(1) = p_{\\phi}\n$$\nThus, the momentum map is simply the canonical momentum $p_{\\phi}$.\n\n**3. Marsden-Weinstein Reduction**\n\nThe reduction procedure at a regular value $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}$ of the momentum map involves two steps. First, we restrict the dynamics to the level set $J^{-1}(\\mu)$. This corresponds to imposing the constraint that the conserved quantity is fixed:\n$$\nJ = p_{\\phi} = \\mu\n$$\nSubstituting this constraint into the canonical Hamiltonian $H$ gives the Hamiltonian on the constrained submanifold $J^{-1}(\\mu) \\subset T^{*}S^{2}$:\n$$\nH|_{J^{-1}(\\mu)} = \\frac{p_{\\theta}^{2}}{2mR^{2}} + \\frac{\\mu^{2}}{2mR^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta} + V(\\theta)\n$$\nSecond, we consider the quotient space $J^{-1}(\\mu)/G$, which is the reduced phase space. The action of $G=SO(2)$ on $J^{-1}(\\mu)$ is the flow generated by the Hamiltonian vector field of $J$, which corresponds to translations in the $\\phi$ coordinate. The quotient space is formed by identifying points along the orbits of this action, which effectively eliminates the $\\phi$ coordinate.\n\nSince the Hamiltonian $H|_{J^{-1}(\\mu)}$ is independent of $\\phi$, it is constant along the orbits of $G$ and thus descends to a well-defined function on the quotient space. This function is the reduced Hamiltonian $H_{\\mu}$. The reduced phase space is coordinatized by $(\\theta, p_{\\theta})$.\nTherefore, the reduced Hamiltonian is:\n$$\nH_{\\mu}(\\theta, p_{\\theta}) = \\frac{p_{\\theta}^{2}}{2mR^{2}} + \\frac{\\mu^{2}}{2mR^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta} + V(\\theta)\n$$\nThis expression describes the dynamics of the system in terms of the reduced variables. The term $\\frac{\\mu^{2}}{2mR^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta}$ is an effective potential, often called the \"centrifugal barrier,\" arising from the conservation of the angular momentum component $\\mu = p_{\\phi}$.",

The Hamiltonian vector field $X_h$ is the vector field whose flow generates these dynamics. It is defined by the relation $L_{X_h}F = \\{F, h\\}$, where $L_{X_h}F$ is the Lie derivative of $F$ along $X_h$. For a scalar function on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, this is simply the directional derivative, $L_{X_h}F = \\nabla F \\cdot X_h$.\n\nEquating the two expressions for the time evolution of $F$, we get:\n$$\n\\nabla F(\\mu) \\cdot X_h(\\mu) = \\{F, h\\}(\\mu) = -\\mu \\cdot (\\nabla F(\\mu) \\times \\nabla h(\\mu))\n$$\nUsing the cyclic property of the scalar triple product, $a \\cdot (b \\times c) = c \\cdot (a \\times b)$, we can rewrite the right-hand side:\n$$\n-\\mu \\cdot (\\nabla F \\times \\nabla h) = -(\\nabla F \\times \\nabla h) \\cdot \\mu = \\nabla F \\cdot (\\mu \\times \\nabla h)\n$$\nThus, we have:\n$$\n\\nabla F(\\mu) \\cdot X_h(\\mu) = \\nabla F(\\mu) \\cdot (\\mu \\times \\nabla h(\\mu))\n$$\nSince this must hold for any smooth function $F$, we can identify the vector field $X_h(\\mu)$ as:\n$$\nX_h(\\mu) = \\mu \\times \\nabla h(\\mu)\n$$\nThe corresponding equation of motion for the angular momentum $\\mu$ is the Lie-Poisson flow equation:\n$$\n\\dot{\\mu} = X_h(\\mu) = \\mu \\times \\nabla h(\\mu)\n$$\nNext, we compute the gradient of the reduced Hamiltonian $h(\\mu) = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu^{\\top}\\mathbb{I}^{-1}\\mu$.

Equivalently, there must exist an element $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ (the \"Lagrange multiplier\") such that:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}H(m_{0}) = \\langle \\mathrm{d}J(m_{0}), \\xi \\rangle\n$$\nHere, $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ denotes the pairing between $\\mathfrak{g}^{*}$ and $\\mathfrak{g}$. We can write this more explicitly as $\\mathrm{d}H(m_{0}) = \\mathrm{d}(\\langle J, \\xi \\rangle)(m_{0})$.\n\nNow, we use the definition of the Hamiltonian vector field $X_{H}$, which is $X_{H} \\lrcorner \\omega = \\mathrm{d}H$, or $i_{X_{H}}\\omega = \\mathrm{d}H$. The momentum map $J$ is defined such that for any $\\eta \\in \\mathfrak{g}$, the function $J_{\\eta}(m) = \\langle J(m), \\eta \\rangle$ is the Hamiltonian for the infinitesimal generator $\\eta_{M}$, i.e., $i_{\\eta_{M}}\\omega = \\mathrm{d}J_{\\eta} = \\mathrm{d}\\langle J, \\eta \\rangle$. Applying this to our specific element $\\xi$, we have $i_{\\xi_{M}}\\omega = \\mathrm{d}\\langle J, \\xi \\rangle$.\n\nSubstituting these into our Lagrange multiplier condition at $m_{0}$:\n$$\ni_{X_{H}(m_{0})}\\omega = i_{\\xi_{M}(m_{0})}\\omega\n$$\nSince the symplectic form $\\omega$ is non-degenerate, this implies the equality of the vector fields at $m_{0}$:\n$$\nX_{H}(m_{0}) = \\xi_{M}(m_{0})\n$$\nThis equation links the Hamiltonian vector field of $H$ at $m_{0}$ to the infinitesimal generator corresponding to the element $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{g}$.\n\nThe trajectory $m(t)$ of the unreduced system must satisfy Hamilton's equation $\\dot{m}(t) = X_{H}(m(t))$ with the initial condition $m(0) = m_{0}$. Let us propose a solution of the form:\n$$\nm(t) = \\exp(t\\xi) \\cdot m_{0}\n$$\nwhere $\\exp:\\mathfrak{g}\\to G$ is the group exponential map. This trajectory describes a motion along the orbit of $m_0$ under the one-parameter subgroup generated by $\\xi$. The initial condition $m(0) = \\exp(0) \\cdot m_{0} = e \\cdot m_{0} = m_{0}$ is satisfied.\n\nWe must verify that this proposed solution satisfies Hamilton's equation. The velocity vector of the curve is, by definition of the infinitesimal generator:\n$$\n\\dot{m}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\exp(t\\xi) \\cdot m_{0}) = \\xi_{M}(\\exp(t\\xi) \\cdot m_{0}) = \\xi_{M}(m(t))\n$$\nWe need to show that $\\xi_{M}(m(t)) = X_{H}(m(t))$.\nThe Hamiltonian $H$ is $G$-invariant, which implies that its Hamiltonian vector field $X_{H}$ is equivariant with respect to the group action. That is, for any $g \\in G$, $g_{*}X_{H}(m) = X_{H}(g \\cdot m)$, where $g_*$ is the pushforward map. Applying this with $g = \\exp(t\\xi)$:\n$$\nX_{H}(m(t)) = X_{H}(\\exp(t\\xi) \\cdot m_{0}) = (\\exp(t\\xi))_{*}X_{H}(m_{0})\n$$\nThe infinitesimal generator field $\\xi_M$ is constructed to be invariant under the flow it generates, meaning $(\\exp(t\\xi))_*\\xi_M(m_0) = \\xi_M(\\exp(t\\xi)\\cdot m_0)$. So we have:\n$$\n\\xi_{M}(m(t)) = (\\exp(t\\xi))_{*}\\xi_{M}(m_{0})\n$$\nComparing the expressions for $X_H(m(t))$ and $\\xi_M(m(t))$, we see that they are equal if and only if their values at $m_0$ are equal, which is precisely the condition $X_{H}(m_{0}) = \\xi_{M}(m_{0})$ that we derived. Thus, the proposed trajectory is indeed the correct solution to Hamilton's equations.\n\nFinally, we must show that this motion is generated by an element $\\xi$ in the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}_{\\mu}$ of the isotropy group $G_{\\mu}$. The trajectory must remain on the level set $J^{-1}(\\mu)$ for all time, since $m_0 \\in J^{-1}(\\mu)$ and $J$ is a conserved quantity for any $G$-invariant Hamiltonian. Let's verify this using the equivariance of the momentum map, $J(g \\cdot m) = \\operatorname{Ad}^{*}_{g}J(m)$:\n$$\nJ(m(t)) = J(\\exp(t\\xi) \\cdot m_{0}) = \\operatorname{Ad}^{*}_{\\exp(t\\xi)}J(m_{0})\n$$\nSince $m_0 \\in J^{-1}(\\mu)$, we have $J(m_{0}) = \\mu$. For the trajectory to stay in $J^{-1}(\\mu)$, we must have $J(m(t)) = \\mu$ for all $t$. This requires:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ad}^{*}_{\\exp(t\\xi)}\\mu = \\mu \\quad \\text{for all } t\n$$\nThis condition means that the one-parameter subgroup $\\{\\exp(t\\xi)\\}_{t\\in\\mathbb{R}}$ is contained in the isotropy subgroup $G_{\\mu}$. This, in turn, is equivalent to its generator $\\xi$ being in the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}_{\\mu}$ of $G_{\\mu}$. The infinitesimal condition is obtained by differentiating at $t=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\operatorname{Ad}^{*}_{\\exp(t\\xi)}\\mu = \\operatorname{ad}^{*}_{\\xi}\\mu = 0\n$$\nThis is the defining condition for an element $\\xi$ to be in $\\mathfrak{g}_{\\mu}$.\n\nTherefore, the unreduced motion lifting the fixed point $\\bar{m} \\in M_{\\mu}$ is a trajectory $m(t)$ that moves along the group orbit of its initial point $m_{0}$ under the action of the one-parameter subgroup generated by a constant element $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{g}_{\\mu}$. This type of motion is known as a relative equilibrium. The closed-form expression for this trajectory is:\n$$\nm(t) = \\exp(t\\xi) \\cdot m_{0}\n$$\nThe element $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{g}_{\\mu}$ is uniquely determined by the condition $X_{H}(m_{0}) = \\xi_{M}(m_{0})$, provided the map $\\xi \\mapsto \\xi_M(m_0)$ is injective, which is true because the action is free.",
