            "solution": "The problem is well-posed, self-contained, and scientifically grounded within the field of symplectic geometry. All terms are standard or explicitly defined. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nLet the vector space be $V = \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ with coordinates $(x_1, \\dots, x_n, y_1, \\dots, y_n)$. A vector $v \\in V$ can be identified with the point $(\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_n, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_n)$, where $\\alpha_i = x_i(v)$ and $\\beta_i = y_i(v)$. The standard symplectic form is $\\omega = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} dx_i \\wedge dy_i$. For two vectors $v = (\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_n, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_n)$ and $w = (\\xi_1, \\dots, \\xi_n, \\eta_1, \\dots, \\eta_n)$, the symplectic pairing is given by $\\omega(v,w) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\alpha_i \\eta_i - \\beta_i \\xi_i)$.\n\nThe subspace $S \\subset V$ is defined by the $k$ linear constraints $x_1 = \\dots = x_k = 0$. The dimension of $V$ is $2n$. Since $S$ is defined by $k$ independent linear constraints, its dimension is $\\dim(S) = 2n - k$. A vector $w = (\\xi_1, \\dots, \\xi_n, \\eta_1, \\dots, \\eta_n)$ belongs to $S$ if and only if $\\xi_1 = \\dots = \\xi_k = 0$.\n\n### 1. Computation of the Symplectic Orthogonal $S^{\\omega}$\n\nThe symplectic orthogonal $S^{\\omega}$ is the set of all vectors $v \\in V$ such that $\\omega(v,w) = 0$ for all $w \\in S$. Let $v = (\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_n, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_n)$ be an arbitrary vector in $V$. Let $w = (0, \\dots, 0, \\xi_{k+1}, \\dots, \\xi_n, \\eta_1, \\dots, \\eta_n)$ be an arbitrary vector in $S$. The condition $\\omega(v,w) = 0$ becomes:\n$$ \\omega(v,w) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\alpha_i \\eta_i - \\beta_i \\xi_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\alpha_i \\eta_i - \\sum_{i=k+1}^{n} \\beta_i \\xi_i = 0 $$\nThis equation must hold for all possible values of the independent coordinates of $w \\in S$, which are $\\{\\eta_1, \\dots, \\eta_n\\}$ and $\\{\\xi_{k+1}, \\dots, \\xi_n\\}$. For this linear combination to be zero for all choices of these variables, the coefficients of each variable must be zero.\n\n1.  Coefficients of $\\eta_i$: For each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, the coefficient of $\\eta_i$ is $\\alpha_i$. Thus, we must have $\\alpha_i = 0$ for all $i=1, \\dots, n$.\n2.  Coefficients of $\\xi_i$: For each $i \\in \\{k+1, \\dots, n\\}$, the coefficient of $\\xi_i$ is $-\\beta_i$. Thus, we must have $\\beta_i = 0$ for all $i=k+1, \\dots, n$.\n\nA vector $v$ is in $S^{\\omega}$ if and only if its components satisfy these conditions. In terms of the coordinate functions, this means $x_1(v)=\\dots=x_n(v)=0$ and $y_{k+1}(v)=\\dots=y_n(v)=0$. The coordinates $y_1, \\dots, y_k$ can be chosen freely. Therefore, $S^{\\omega}$ is the subspace spanned by the basis vectors corresponding to these free coordinates, giving a dimension of $\\dim(S^{\\omega}) = k$. The explicit description in coordinates is:\n$$ S^{\\omega} = \\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2n} \\mid x_1=\\dots=x_n=0, y_{k+1}=\\dots=y_n=0\\} $$\n\n### 2. Classification of the Subspace $S$\n\nWe classify $S$ based on the definitions provided.\n-   **Coisotropic**: A subspace $S$ is coisotropic if $S^{\\omega} \\subseteq S$.\n    A vector $v \\in S^{\\omega}$ is defined by the conditions $x_1(v)=\\dots=x_n(v)=0$ and $y_{k+1}(v)=\\dots=y_n(v)=0$.\n    A vector $u \\in S$ is defined by the conditions $x_1(u)=\\dots=x_k(u)=0$.\n    If $v \\in S^{\\omega}$, then $x_1(v)=\\dots=x_n(v)=0$, which immediately implies that $x_1(v)=\\dots=x_k(v)=0$. Therefore, any vector in $S^{\\omega}$ satisfies the defining conditions for $S$. This means $S^{\\omega} \\subseteq S$. This inclusion holds for all $k$ in the range $1 \\le k \\le n$. Thus, $S$ is always coisotropic.\n\n-   **Isotropic**: A subspace $S$ is isotropic if $\\omega|_{S}=0$. This is equivalent to the condition $S \\subseteq S^{\\omega}$.\n    For $S \\subseteq S^{\\omega}$ to hold, any vector $v \\in S$ must satisfy the defining conditions for $S^{\\omega}$.\n    Let $v \\in S$. This means $x_1(v)=\\dots=x_k(v)=0$.\n    For $v$ to be in $S^{\\omega}$, it must also satisfy $x_{k+1}(v)=\\dots=x_n(v)=0$ and $y_{k+1}(v)=\\dots=y_n(v)=0$.\n    However, for a general vector in $S$, the coordinates $x_{k+1}, \\dots, x_n$ and $y_{k+1}, \\dots, y_n$ are free variables. The condition $S \\subseteq S^{\\omega}$ forces these free variables to be zero for all vectors in $S$. This can only be true if there are no such free variables to begin with, which means the index set $\\{k+1, \\dots, n\\}$ must be empty. This occurs if and only if $k+1 > n$, which, given $k \\le n$, implies $k=n$.\n    If $k=n$, $S$ is defined by $x_1=\\dots=x_n=0$, and $S^{\\omega}$ is defined by $x_1=\\dots=x_n=0$ (the conditions on $y$ coordinates become empty). In this case, $S = S^{\\omega}$, so $S \\subseteq S^{\\omega}$ holds.\n    Therefore, $S$ is isotropic if and only if $k=n$.\n\n-   **Lagrangian**: A subspace $S$ is Lagrangian if $S = S^{\\omega}$.\n    This requires $S$ to be both coisotropic and isotropic. Based on our analysis, this occurs when $k=n$. We can also verify this by comparing dimensions. For equality $S=S^{\\omega}$, we need $\\dim(S) = \\dim(S^{\\omega})$. We found $\\dim(S) = 2n-k$ and $\\dim(S^{\\omega}) = k$. Setting them equal gives $2n-k = k$, which implies $2k=2n$, or $k=n$.\n    When $k=n$, $S=S^{\\omega}$, and $\\dim(S)=n$, which matches the definition of a Lagrangian subspace in a $2n$-dimensional space.\n\nThe classification is as follows:\n-   If $1 \\le k  n$, then $\\dim(S^{\\omega}) = k  2n-k = \\dim(S)$, so $S^{\\omega}$ is a proper subspace of $S$. Thus $S$ is coisotropic but not isotropic or Lagrangian.\n-   If $k = n$, then $S=S^{\\omega}$, so $S$ is Lagrangian.\n\n### 3. Characteristic Distribution and Dimension of the Reduced Space\n\nThe characteristic distribution is defined as $\\mathcal{C} = S \\cap S^{\\omega}$. As established in the classification, we have $S^{\\omega} \\subseteq S$ for all $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. Therefore, the intersection is simply $S^{\\omega}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{C} = S^{\\omega} $$\nThe dimension of the characteristic distribution is $\\dim(\\mathcal{C}) = \\dim(S^{\\omega}) = k$.\n\nThe reduced space is the quotient space $S/\\mathcal{C}$. Since $S$ and $\\mathcal{C}$ are vector subspaces of $V$, the dimension of the quotient space is given by:\n$$ \\dim(S/\\mathcal{C}) = \\dim(S) - \\dim(\\mathcal{C}) $$\nSubstituting the dimensions we found:\n$$ \\dim(S/\\mathcal{C}) = (2n - k) - k = 2n - 2k $$\nThis dimension is always an even number, $2(n-k)$, as expected for a symplectic vector space. This result is valid for all $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\n### Summary of Results\n1.  **$S^{\\omega}$ Description**: The subspace where the first $n$ coordinates ($x_i$) and the last $n-k$ of the second set of coordinates ($y_i$) are zero.\n    $S^{\\omega} = \\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2n} \\mid x_1=\\cdots=x_n=0, y_{k+1}=\\cdots=y_n=0\\}$.\n2.  **Classification**: The subspace $S$ is always coisotropic. It is Lagrangian if and only if $k=n$. For $kn$, it is strictly coisotropic (i.e., not isotropic).\n3.  **Dimension of Reduced Space**: $\\dim(S/\\mathcal{C}) = 2n-2k$.",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Characteristic Distribution and Leaves**\n\nThe constraint submanifold $\\mathcal{C}$ is defined by the zero level set of the function $\\phi(q,p) = p \\cdot v = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i v^i$. Here, $v^i$ are the components of the fixed vector $v$.\n\nThe characteristic distribution of $\\mathcal{C}$ is, by definition, the symplectic orthocomplement of its tangent bundle within itself: $T\\mathcal{C}^{\\omega} = \\{ X \\in T\\mathcal{C} \\mid \\omega(X,Y)=0 \\text{ for all } Y \\in T\\mathcal{C} \\}$. Another definition provided is the kernel of the pulled-back symplectic form $i^{\\ast}\\omega$. We will show these are equivalent and use them to find the distribution.\n\nLet's first find the Hamiltonian vector field $X_{\\phi}$ associated with the constraint function $\\phi$. It is defined by the relation $i_{X_{\\phi}}\\omega = d\\phi$.\nThe exterior derivative of $\\phi$ is $d\\phi = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} v^i dp_i$.\nLet $X_{\\phi} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (A^j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^j} + B_j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_j})$. Contracting $X_{\\phi}$ with $\\omega = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} dq^j \\wedge dp_j$ yields:\n$$\ni_{X_{\\phi}}\\omega = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (A^j dp_j - B_j dq^j)\n$$\nComparing this with $d\\phi$, we find $A^j = v^j$ and $B_j = 0$ for all $j=1, \\dots, n$. Thus, the Hamiltonian vector field is:\n$$\nX_{\\phi} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} v^j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^j}\n$$\nThis vector field must be tangent to $\\mathcal{C}$ for $\\mathcal{C}$ to be coisotropic. A vector field $X$ is tangent to the surface $\\phi=0$ if $X(\\phi)=d\\phi(X)=0$.\n$$\nd\\phi(X_{\\phi}) = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} v^i dp_i\\right) \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} v^j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^j}\\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $X_\\phi$ is tangent to $\\mathcal{C}$, the characteristic distribution $\\mathcal{F}$ is spanned by $X_\\phi$. So, $\\mathcal{F}|_{(q,p)} = \\text{span}(X_{\\phi}|_{(q,p)})$ for each $(q,p) \\in \\mathcal{C}$.\n\nThe leaves of the characteristic foliation $\\mathcal{F}$ are the integral curves of the vector field $X_{\\phi}$. The differential equations for the integral curves $(q(t), p(t))$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{dq^j}{dt} = v^j, \\quad \\frac{dp_j}{dt} = 0\n$$\nFor an initial condition $(q_0, p_0) \\in \\mathcal{C}$, the solution is:\n$$\nq(t) = q_0 + tv, \\quad p(t) = p_0\n$$\nThe condition for the initial point to be in $\\mathcal{C}$ is $p_0 \\cdot v = 0$. This condition remains satisfied along the entire curve since $p(t)=p_0$. A leaf of the foliation is the set of all points on such a curve. Thus, the leaf passing through $(q_0, p_0) \\in \\mathcal{C}$ is the line $\\{(q_0 + tv, p_0) \\mid t \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$. This describes a translation in the configuration space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ in the direction of $v$, while the momentum $p$ remains fixed.\n\n**Part 2: Reduced Space**\n\nThe reduced space, denoted $\\mathcal{C}/\\mathcal{F}$, is the space of leaves of the characteristic foliation. Each leaf is an equivalence class, where two points $(q_1, p_1)$ and $(q_2, p_2)$ in $\\mathcal{C}$ are equivalent if they lie on the same leaf.\nBased on the description of the leaves, this means $(q_1, p_1) \\sim (q_2, p_2)$ if and only if $p_1 = p_2$ and $q_2 - q_1$ is a multiple of $v$.\n\nA point in the reduced space is therefore specified by:\n1.  A momentum vector $p$ such that $p \\cdot v = 0$. The space of all such momenta is the $(n-1)$-dimensional subspace of $(\\mathbb{R}^n)^*$ which is the annihilator of $\\text{span}(v)$. Using the canonical inner product to identify $(\\mathbb{R}^n)^*$ with $\\mathbb{R}^n$, this is the orthogonal complement $v^{\\perp}$.\n2.  An equivalence class of positions $[q]$, where $[q] = \\{q' \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid q' - q \\in \\text{span}(v)\\}$. This is a line in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ parallel to $v$. The space of all such lines is the quotient space $\\mathbb{R}^n / \\text{span}(v)$, which is canonically isomorphic to $v^{\\perp}$.\n\nThe reduced space is the product of the space of allowed momenta and the space of position equivalence classes. This is $(\\mathbb{R}^n / \\text{span}(v)) \\times v^{\\perp}$. Identifying $\\mathbb{R}^n / \\text{span}(v)$ with $v^{\\perp}$, the space of momenta in $v^{\\perp}$ is precisely the cotangent space to the position space $v^{\\perp}$ at each point. Therefore, the reduced space is canonically identified with the cotangent bundle of $v^{\\perp}$, denoted $T^{\\ast}(v^{\\perp})$. Since $v^{\\perp}$ is an $(n-1)$-dimensional vector space, $T^{\\ast}(v^{\\perp})$ is a $2(n-1)$-dimensional symplectic manifold.\n\n**Part 3: Reduced Symplectic Form**\n\nWe introduce an orthonormal basis of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ adapted to $v$. Let $\\hat{v} = v/|v|$, and let $\\{e_a\\}_{a=1}^{n-1}$ be an orthonormal basis for the subspace $v^{\\perp}$. Any vectors $q \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\cong (\\mathbb{R}^n)^*$ can be decomposed as:\n$$\nq = q^{\\parallel}\\hat{v} + \\sum_{a=1}^{n-1}q^{a}e_{a}, \\quad p = p_{\\parallel}\\hat{v} + \\sum_{a=1}^{n-1}p_{a}e_{a}\n$$\nThe set $(q^{\\parallel}, q^1, \\dots, q^{n-1}, p_{\\parallel}, p_1, \\dots, p_{n-1})$ forms a valid set of canonical coordinates for $T^{\\ast}\\mathbb{R}^n$. The canonical one-form $\\theta = \\sum_i p_i dq^i$ and symplectic form $\\omega = d\\theta$ in these coordinates are:\n$$\n\\theta = p_{\\parallel}dq^{\\parallel} + \\sum_{a=1}^{n-1} p_a dq^a, \\quad \\omega = dq^{\\parallel} \\wedge dp_{\\parallel} + \\sum_{a=1}^{n-1} dq^a \\wedge dp_a\n$$\nThe constraint $p \\cdot v = 0$ is equivalent to $p \\cdot \\hat{v} = 0$, which in these coordinates is simply $p_{\\parallel}=0$. The submanifold $\\mathcal{C}$ is thus defined by $p_{\\parallel}=0$. The natural coordinates on $\\mathcal{C}$ are $(q^{\\parallel}, q^a, p_a)$.\n\nThe inclusion map is $i: \\mathcal{C} \\hookrightarrow T^{\\ast}\\mathbb{R}^n$. We compute the pullback $i^{\\ast}\\omega$. On $\\mathcal{C}$, $p_{\\parallel}=0$, which implies its differential $dp_{\\parallel}=0$ on $T\\mathcal{C}$.\n$$\ni^{\\ast}\\omega = i^{\\ast}\\left(dq^{\\parallel} \\wedge dp_{\\parallel} + \\sum_{a=1}^{n-1} dq^a \\wedge dp_a\\right) = dq^{\\parallel} \\wedge d(0) + \\sum_{a=1}^{n-1} dq^a \\wedge dp_a = \\sum_{a=1}^{n-1} dq^a \\wedge dp_a\n$$\nThe characteristic distribution $\\mathcal{F}$ is the kernel of $i^{\\ast}\\omega$. A vector field $X$ on $\\mathcal{C}$ can be written as $X = A\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{\\parallel}} + \\sum_a (B^a \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^a} + C_a \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_a})$.\n$$\ni_X(i^{\\ast}\\omega) = i_X\\left(\\sum_{b=1}^{n-1} dq^b \\wedge dp_b\\right) = \\sum_{b=1}^{n-1} (B^b dp_b - C_b dq^b)\n$$\nFor $X$ to be in the kernel, we must have $i_X(i^{\\ast}\\omega) = 0$, which implies $B^b=0$ and $C_b=0$ for all $b$. Thus, $X$ must be of the form $A\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{\\parallel}}$. This means $\\mathcal{F} = \\text{span}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{\\parallel}})$. The integral curves are lines along which only $q^{\\parallel}$ changes, which confirms our findings from Part 1 since $q^{\\parallel}$ is the coordinate along the direction of $v$.\n\nThe reduced space $\\mathcal{C}/\\mathcal{F}$ consists of points identified by the values of the coordinates that are constant along the leaves of $\\mathcal{F}$. These coordinates are $(q^a, p_a)_{a=1}^{n-1}$. These serve as coordinates for the reduced space, which we identified as $T^*(v^\\perp)$. The projection map $\\pi: \\mathcal{C} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{C}/\\mathcal{F}$ is given in these coordinates by $\\pi(q^{\\parallel}, q^a, p_a) = (q^a, p_a)$.\n\nThe reduced symplectic form $\\omega_{\\mathrm{red}}$ on $\\mathcal{C}/\\mathcal{F}$ is defined by the relation $\\pi^{\\ast}\\omega_{\\mathrm{red}} = i^{\\ast}\\omega$. Let $(\\tilde{q}^a, \\tilde{p}_a)$ be the coordinates on the reduced space, so that $\\tilde{q}^a \\circ \\pi = q^a$ and $\\tilde{p}_a \\circ \\pi = p_a$. We have:\n$$\ni^{\\ast}\\omega = \\sum_{a=1}^{n-1} dq^a \\wedge dp_a = \\sum_{a=1}^{n-1} d(\\tilde{q}^a \\circ \\pi) \\wedge d(\\tilde{p}_a \\circ \\pi) = \\pi^{\\ast}\\left(\\sum_{a=1}^{n-1} d\\tilde{q}^a \\wedge d\\tilde{p}_a\\right)\n$$\nBy uniqueness, we can identify $\\omega_{\\mathrm{red}}$ on the reduced space.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard exercise in the application of constraint theory in Hamiltonian mechanics and coisotropic reduction in symplectic geometry. All necessary information is provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nWe begin with the symplectic manifold $(M, \\omega)$, where $M = \\mathbb{R}^4$ with global coordinates $(q_1, p_1, q_2, p_2)$ and the canonical symplectic form is $\\omega = dq_1 \\wedge dp_1 + dq_2 \\wedge dp_2$. The Poisson bracket of two smooth functions $F, G \\in C^\\infty(M)$ is given by\n$$\n\\{F, G\\} = \\sum_{i=1}^2 \\left( \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial q_i} \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial p_i} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p_i} \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial q_i} \\right)\n$$\n\n### Part 1: Dirac Bracket for Second-Class Constraints\n\nWe are given two constraints $\\phi_1 = q_2$ and $\\phi_2 = p_1 + \\gamma p_2$, where $\\gamma \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. To classify these constraints, we compute the constraint Poisson matrix $C_{ab} = \\{\\phi_a, \\phi_b\\}$ for $a, b \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\n\nThe components are calculated as follows:\n$C_{11} = \\{\\phi_1, \\phi_1\\} = \\{q_2, q_2\\} = \\frac{\\partial q_2}{\\partial q_2} \\frac{\\partial q_2}{\\partial p_2} - \\frac{\\partial q_2}{\\partial p_2} \\frac{\\partial q_2}{\\partial q_2} = 0$.\n\n$C_{12} = \\{\\phi_1, \\phi_2\\} = \\{q_2, p_1 + \\gamma p_2\\} = \\{q_2, p_1\\} + \\gamma \\{q_2, p_2\\}$.\nUsing the Poisson bracket definition:\n$\\{q_2, p_1\\} = \\frac{\\partial q_2}{\\partial q_1}\\frac{\\partial p_1}{\\partial p_1} - \\frac{\\partial q_2}{\\partial p_1}\\frac{\\partial p_1}{\\partial q_1} + \\frac{\\partial q_2}{\\partial q_2}\\frac{\\partial p_1}{\\partial p_2} - \\frac{\\partial q_2}{\\partial p_2}\\frac{\\partial p_1}{\\partial q_2} = 0$.\n$\\{q_2, p_2\\} = \\frac{\\partial q_2}{\\partial q_2}\\frac{\\partial p_2}{\\partial p_2} - \\frac{\\partial q_2}{\\partial p_2}\\frac{\\partial p_2}{\\partial q_2} = (1)(1) - (0)(0) = 1$.\nThus, $C_{12} = 0 + \\gamma(1) = \\gamma$.\n\n$C_{21} = \\{\\phi_2, \\phi_1\\} = -\\{\\phi_1, \\phi_2\\} = -\\gamma$.\n\n$C_{22} = \\{\\phi_2, \\phi_2\\} = \\{p_1 + \\gamma p_2, p_1 + \\gamma p_2\\} = \\{p_1, p_1\\} + \\gamma\\{p_1, p_2\\} + \\gamma\\{p_2, p_1\\} + \\gamma^2\\{p_2, p_2\\}$.\nSince $\\{p_i, p_j\\} = 0$ for any $i,j$, all terms are zero. So, $C_{22}=0$.\n\nThe constraint Poisson matrix is:\n$$\nC = \\begin{pmatrix} C_{11}  C_{12} \\\\ C_{21}  C_{22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\gamma \\\\ -\\gamma  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of this matrix is $\\det(C) = (0)(0) - (\\gamma)(-\\gamma) = \\gamma^2$. Since we are given that $\\gamma \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, we have $\\det(C) = \\gamma^2 \\neq 0$. An invertible constraint matrix signifies that the constraints are second-class.\n\nThe inverse of the constraint matrix, denoted $(C^{-1})^{ab}$, is:\n$$\nC^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -\\gamma \\\\ \\gamma  0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -1/\\gamma \\\\ 1/\\gamma  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe Dirac bracket for two functions $f$ and $g$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\{f, g\\}_D = \\{f, g\\} - \\sum_{a,b=1}^{2} \\{f, \\phi_a\\} (C^{-1})^{ab} \\{\\phi_b, g\\}\n$$\nWe need to compute this for $f = q_1$ and $g = p_2$.\nFirst, we compute the standard Poisson bracket $\\{q_1, p_2\\} = 0$.\nNext, we compute the brackets involving the constraints:\n$\\{f, \\phi_1\\} = \\{q_1, q_2\\} = 0$.\n$\\{f, \\phi_2\\} = \\{q_1, p_1 + \\gamma p_2\\} = \\{q_1, p_1\\} + \\gamma\\{q_1, p_2\\} = 1 + \\gamma(0) = 1$.\n$\\{\\phi_1, g\\} = \\{q_2, p_2\\} = 1$.\n$\\{\\phi_2, g\\} = \\{p_1 + \\gamma p_2, p_2\\} = \\{p_1, p_2\\} + \\gamma\\{p_2, p_2\\} = 0 + \\gamma(0) = 0$.\n\nNow we assemble the sum in the Dirac bracket definition. The sum is:\n$$\n\\{f, \\phi_1\\}(C^{-1})^{11}\\{\\phi_1, g\\} + \\{f, \\phi_1\\}(C^{-1})^{12}\\{\\phi_2, g\\} + \\{f, \\phi_2\\}(C^{-1})^{21}\\{\\phi_1, g\\} + \\{f, \\phi_2\\}(C^{-1})^{22}\\{\\phi_2, g\\}\n$$\nSubstituting the values we computed:\n$ (0) (0) (1) + (0) (-1/\\gamma) (0) + (1) (1/\\gamma) (1) + (1) (0) (0) = 0 + 0 + \\frac{1}{\\gamma} + 0 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma} $.\n\nFinally, the Dirac bracket is:\n$$\n\\{q_1, p_2\\}_D = \\{q_1, p_2\\} - \\frac{1}{\\gamma} = 0 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma} = -\\frac{1}{\\gamma}\n$$\nThis result is evaluated on the constraint surface $\\phi_1 = q_2 = 0$ and $\\phi_2 = p_1 + \\gamma p_2 = 0$. Since the result is a constant, it holds everywhere, including on the surface.\n\n### Part 2: Coisotropic Reduction for a First-Class Constraint\n\nWe consider a single constraint $\\chi = q_2$, defining the hypersurface $C = \\{(q_1, p_1, q_2, p_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^4 \\mid q_2 = 0\\}$.\nA submanifold defined by constraints $\\chi_a = 0$ is coisotropic if the Poisson brackets $\\{\\chi_a, \\chi_b\\}$ vanish on the constraint surface. For a single constraint $\\chi$, this condition is simply $\\{\\chi, \\chi\\} = 0$.\nWe check this: $\\{\\chi, \\chi\\} = \\{q_2, q_2\\} = 0$. This holds everywhere, so $C$ is a coisotropic submanifold. Such a constraint is called first-class.\n\nThe characteristic distribution $\\mathcal{F}$ on $C$ is the distribution whose fibers are the symplectic orthogonal complements of the tangent spaces of $C$, i.e., $\\mathcal{F}_x = (T_x C)^\\omega$. This distribution is generated by the Hamiltonian vector fields of the constraints restricted to $C$. Here, we have one generator, $X_\\chi$.\n\nThe Hamiltonian vector field $X_\\chi$ is defined by the relation $i_{X_\\chi} \\omega = d\\chi$. With $\\chi = q_2$, we have $d\\chi = dq_2$.\nLet $X_\\chi = A\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_1} + B\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_1} + C\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_2} + D\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_2}$.\n$i_{X_\\chi} \\omega = i_{X_\\chi}(dq_1 \\wedge dp_1 + dq_2 \\wedge dp_2) = A dp_1 - B dq_1 + C dp_2 - D dq_2$.\nEquating this with $dq_2$:\n$A dp_1 - B dq_1 + C dp_2 - D dq_2 = 1 \\cdot dq_2$.\nBy comparing coefficients of the basis 1-forms, we find $A=0$, $B=0$, $C=0$, and $-D=1$, which implies $D=-1$.\nSo, the Hamiltonian vector field is $X_\\chi = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_2}$.\n\nThe characteristic distribution on $C$ is $\\mathcal{F} = \\text{span}\\{X_\\chi\\} = \\text{span}\\{-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_2}\\}$. The integral curves of this vector field define the characteristic foliation. An integral curve starting at a point $(q_{1_0}, p_{1_0}, 0, p_{2_0}) \\in C$ is given by the path $t \\mapsto (q_{1_0}, p_{1_0}, 0, p_{2_0}-t)$. These are straight lines parallel to the $p_2$-axis.\n\nThe coisotropic reduction is the quotient space $M_{red} = C/\\mathcal{F}$, which is the space of these characteristic leaves. Two points $(q_1, p_1, 0, p_2)$ and $(q'_1, p'_1, 0, p'_2)$ are on the same leaf if and only if $q_1 = q'_1$ and $p_1 = p'_1$. Thus, each leaf is uniquely identified by the values of $q_1$ and $p_1$. The quotient space is diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and we can choose $(q_1, p_1)$ as coordinates.\n\nThe reduced symplectic form $\\omega_{red}$ on $M_{red}$ is such that its pullback to $C$ is the pullback of the original symplectic form $\\omega$. Let $i: C \\hookrightarrow M$ be the inclusion and $\\pi: C \\to M_{red}$ be the projection. Then $\\pi^* \\omega_{red} = i^* \\omega$.\nOn $C$, we have $q_2=0$, which implies that the 1-form $dq_2$ restricted to $C$ is zero.\n$i^* \\omega = i^*(dq_1 \\wedge dp_1 + dq_2 \\wedge dp_2) = i^*(dq_1 \\wedge dp_1) + i^*(dq_2) \\wedge i^*(dp_2) = dq_1 \\wedge dp_1 + 0 \\wedge dp_2 = dq_1 \\wedge dp_1$.\nSince $(q_1,p_1)$ are the coordinates on the quotient space, the reduced symplectic form is $\\omega_{red} = dq_1 \\wedge dp_1$. The canonical pair $(q_1, p_1)$ survives the reduction and forms the coordinates of the reduced phase space. The pair $(q_2, p_2)$ is eliminated; $q_2$ is fixed by the constraint, and $p_2$ parameterizes the gauge orbits that are quotiented out.",
