It is a standard problem in the field of geometric mechanics and is free of any of the specified flaws.\n\n(a) Derivation of Momentum Maps and Poisson Commutation\n\nLet the manifold be $M = T^{*}\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with canonical symplectic form $\\omega = dx \\wedge dp_{x} + dy \\wedge dp_{y}$. The group is $G = G_{1} \\times G_{2}$, where $G_{1}=\\mathbb{R}$ and $G_{2}=\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFirst, we find the momentum map $J_{1}: M \\to \\mathfrak{g}_{1}^{*}$ for the action of $G_{1} = \\mathbb{R}$. The Lie algebra is $\\mathfrak{g}_{1} \\cong \\mathbb{R}$. Let's take $\\xi_{1} = 1$ as a basis for $\\mathfrak{g}_{1}$. The action of $s \\in G_{1}$ on a point $q = (x,y,p_{x},p_{y}) \\in M$ is $s \\cdot q = (x+s, y, p_{x}, p_{y})$. The infinitesimal generator is the vector field $\\xi_{1,M}$ on $M$ given by:\n$$\n\\xi_{1,M}|_{q} = \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg|_{s=0} (x+s, y, p_{x}, p_{y}) = (1, 0, 0, 0) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\n$$\nThe momentum map $J_{1}$ is defined via the relation $d\\langle J_{1}, \\xi_{1} \\rangle = \\iota_{\\xi_{1,M}}\\omega$ for all $\\xi_{1} \\in \\mathfrak{g}_{1}$. Identifying $\\mathfrak{g}_{1}$ and its dual $\\mathfrak{g}_{1}^{*}$ with $\\mathbb{R}$, the pairing $\\langle J_{1}, \\xi_{1} \\rangle$ becomes a scalar function, let's call it $H_{1}$, and $\\xi_{1}$ becomes a scalar. For $\\xi_{1}=1$, we have:\n$$\ndH_{1} = \\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}} \\omega = \\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}}(dx \\wedge dp_{x} + dy \\wedge dp_{y}) = (\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}}dx) \\wedge dp_{x} - dx \\wedge (\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}}dp_{x}) = 1 \\cdot dp_{x} - dx \\cdot 0 = dp_{x}\n$$\nIntegrating $dH_{1} = dp_{x}$ gives $H_{1}(x,y,p_{x},p_{y}) = p_{x} + C$. We choose the integration constant $C=0$. So, the component of the momentum map corresponding to $\\xi_1=1$ is $p_x$. A general element of $\\mathfrak{g}_1$ is $v_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$, which corresponds to the infinitesimal generator $v_1 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$. Then $\\langle J_1, v_1 \\rangle = v_1 p_x$. Under the identification $\\mathfrak{g}_1^* \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, $J_1$ is given by the function whose value is $p_x$.\n$$\nJ_{1}(x,y,p_{x},p_{y}) = p_{x}\n$$\nSimilarly, for $G_{2} = \\mathbb{R}$, the Lie algebra is $\\mathfrak{g}_{2} \\cong \\mathbb{R}$. Let $\\xi_{2} = 1$ be a basis for $\\mathfrak{g}_{2}$. The action of $t \\in G_{2}$ is $t \\cdot q = (x, y+t, p_{x}, p_{y})$. The infinitesimal generator is:\n$$\n\\xi_{2,M}|_{q} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} (x, y+t, p_{x}, p_{y}) = (0, 1, 0, 0) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\n$$\nLet the corresponding component of the momentum map be $H_{2}$.\n$$\ndH_{2} = \\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}} \\omega = \\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}}(dx \\wedge dp_{x} + dy \\wedge dp_{y}) = dp_{y}\n$$\nIntegrating gives $H_{2}(x,y,p_{x},p_{y}) = p_{y}$ (with integration constant set to $0$). So, the momentum map $J_{2}$ is given by:\n$$\nJ_{2}(x,y,p_{x},p_{y}) = p_{y}\n$$\nNext, we show that $\\{ \\langle J_{1},\\xi_{1}\\rangle, \\langle J_{2},\\xi_{2}\\rangle\\} = 0$. For arbitrary $\\xi_{1}, \\xi_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}$, this is equivalent to showing $\\{p_{x}, p_{y}\\} = 0$. The Poisson bracket is defined by $\\{f,g\\} = \\omega(X_{f}, X_{g})$, where the Hamiltonian vector field $X_f$ is defined by $\\iota_{X_{f}}\\omega = df$.\nFor $f = p_{x}$, we have $df = dp_{x}$. We found earlier that $\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}}\\omega = dp_{x}$. So, $X_{p_{x}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$.\nFor $g = p_{y}$, we have $dg = dp_{y}$. We found earlier that $\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}}\\omega = dp_{y}$. So, $X_{p_{y}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$.\nNow we compute the Poisson bracket:\n$$\n\\{p_{x}, p_{y}\\} = \\omega(X_{p_{x}}, X_{p_{y}}) = \\omega\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\omega\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right) = (dx \\wedge dp_{x} + dy \\wedge dp_{y})\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right) = dx\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right)dp_{x}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right) - dx\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right)dp_{x}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right) + dy\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right)dp_{y}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right) - dy\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right)dp_{y}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right)\n$$\nThis evaluates to $1 \\cdot 0 - 0 \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot 1 - 1 \\cdot 0 = 0$. Thus, $\\{p_{x}, p_{y}\\} = 0$, and the momentum map components Poisson commute.\n\n(b) Marsden-Weinstein Reduction\n\nWe perform the reduction for regular values $\\mu_{1}=a \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mu_{2}=b \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nReduction by Stages:\nStep 1: Reduce by $G_{1}$ at $\\mu_{1}=a$.\nThe level set of the momentum map $J_{1}$ is $J_{1}^{-1}(a) = \\{ (x,y,p_{x},p_{y}) \\in T^{*}\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid p_{x}=a \\}$.\nThe group $G_{1}=\\mathbb{R}$ acts on this level set by $s \\cdot (x,y,a,p_{y}) = (x+s,y,a,p_{y})$.\nThe reduced space is the quotient $M_{a} = J_{1}^{-1}(a)/G_{1}$. The action of $G_{1}$ only affects the $x$ coordinate, which is completely \"quotiented out\". The coordinates $(y, p_{y})$ are invariant under the $G_{1}$ action and serve as coordinates for the quotient space. Thus, $M_{a}$ is diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, which we identify with $T^{*}\\mathbb{R}$ with coordinates $(y, p_{y})$.\nThe reduced symplectic form $\\omega_{a}$ on $M_a$ is defined by $\\pi_{a}^{*}\\omega_{a} = i_{a}^{*}\\omega$, where $i_{a}: J_{1}^{-1}(a) \\to T^{*}\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is the inclusion and $\\pi_{a}: J_{1}^{-1}(a) \\to M_{a}$ is the projection.\nOn $J_{1}^{-1}(a)$, $p_{x}=a$ is constant, so $dp_{x}=0$. The pullback of $\\omega$ is $i_{a}^{*}\\omega = dx \\wedge d(a) + dy \\wedge dp_{y} = dy \\wedge dp_{y}$. Since the coordinates on $M_{a}$ are $(y,p_{y})$, the form $\\omega_{a}$ is simply the canonical symplectic form on $T^{*}\\mathbb{R}$, i.e., $\\omega_{a} = dy \\wedge dp_{y}$. So the first reduced space is $(M_a, \\omega_a) \\cong (T^{*}\\mathbb{R}, dy \\wedge dp_y)$.\n\nStep 2: Reduce the $G_{2}$-action on $(M_{a}, \\omega_{a})$ at $\\mu_{2}=b$.\nThe action of $G_{2}$ on $T^{*}\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ commutes with the action of $G_{1}$, so it descends to an action on $M_{a}$. On the coordinates $(y, p_{y})$ of $M_{a}$, the action is $t \\cdot (y, p_{y}) = (y+t, p_{y})$. This is again a cotangent lifted translation.\nThe momentum map $J_{2,a}$ for this action on $M_a$ is found by $d\\langle J_{2,a}, 1\\rangle = \\iota_{\\partial/\\partial y} \\omega_a = \\iota_{\\partial/\\partial y} (dy \\wedge dp_y) = dp_y$. Thus, $J_{2,a}(y, p_{y}) = p_{y}$.\nWe now reduce at level $\\mu_{2}=b$. The level set is $J_{2,a}^{-1}(b) = \\{ (y,p_{y}) \\in M_{a} \\mid p_{y}=b \\}$.\nThe group $G_2$ acts on this level set by $t \\cdot (y,b) = (y+t,b)$. The reduced space is the quotient $(M_{a})_{b} = J_{2,a}^{-1}(b)/G_{2}$. Since the action covers all of the $y$ coordinate, the quotient space is a single point.\n\nReduction by the Full Group $G$:\nThe combined action is by $G = G_{1} \\times G_{2} = \\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and its dual $\\mathfrak{g}^{*} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The combined momentum map is $J: T^{*}\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\to \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$ given by $J = (J_1, J_2)$.\n$$\nJ(x,y,p_{x},p_{y}) = (p_{x}, p_{y})\n$$\nWe reduce at the regular value $\\mu = (a,b) \\in \\mathfrak{g}^{*} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\nThe level set is $J^{-1}(a,b) = \\{ (x,y,p_{x},p_{y}) \\in T^{*}\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid p_{x}=a, p_{y}=b \\}$.\nThe group $G$ acts on this level set by $(s,t) \\cdot (x,y,a,b) = (x+s,y+t,a,b)$.\nThe reduced space is $M_{(a,b)} = J^{-1}(a,b)/G$. The action of $G$ is transitive on the $(x,y)$ plane. Therefore, all points in $J^{-1}(a,b)$ belong to a single orbit. The quotient space $M_{(a,b)}$ is a single point.\n\nVerification:\nBoth reduction procedures yield a reduced space that is a single point. Let this point be denoted by $P$. The symplectomorphism between the two reduced spaces is the unique identity map $P \\to P$. This verifies the principle of reduction by stages for this example. The staged reduction space is $(J_1^{-1}(a)/G_1)_b = (J_1^{-1}(a) \\cap J_2^{-1}(b))/(G_1 \\times G_2)$. The full reduction space is $J^{-1}(a,b)/G = (J_1^{-1}(a) \\cap J_2^{-1}(b))/(G_1 \\times G_2)$. They are manifestly identical.\n\n(c) Reduced Hamiltonian\n\nThe Hamiltonian is $H(x,y,p_{x},p_{y}) = \\frac{1}{2m}(p_{x}^{2}+p_{y}^{2})$.\nWe first check for $G$-invariance. Let $(s,t) \\in G$.\n$$\nH((s,t)\\cdot(x,y,p_{x},p_{y})) = H(x+s,y+t,p_{x},p_{y}) = \\frac{1}{2m}(p_{x}^{2}+p_{y}^{2}) = H(x,y,p_{x},p_{y})\n$$\nThe Hamiltonian is independent of the base coordinates $(x,y)$ and thus is invariant under translations on the base. Since $H$ is $G$-invariant, it is constant on the $G$-orbits in $J^{-1}(a,b)$, and therefore descends to a well-defined function $H_{(a,b)}$ on the reduced space $M_{(a,b)}$.\nThe reduced space is a single point. A function on a point is just a constant value. To find this value, we restrict $H$ to the level set $J^{-1}(a,b)$ and evaluate it. For any point $(x,y,a,b) \\in J^{-1}(a,b)$:\n$$\nH_{(a,b)} = H(x,y,a,b) = \\frac{1}{2m}(a^{2}+b^{2})\n$$\nThis is the value of the reduced Hamiltonian.\n\nAlternatively, using the staged reduction:\n1. The reduced Hamiltonian $H_{a}$ on $M_{a}$ is obtained by restricting $H$ to $J_{1}^{-1}(a)$.\n$H_{a}(y, p_{y}) = H(x,y,a,p_{y}) = \\frac{1}{2m}(a^{2}+p_{y}^{2})$. This function does not depend on $x$, so it is well-defined on the quotient $M_{a}$.\n2. The final reduced Hamiltonian $H_{a,b}$ on $(M_{a})_{b}$ is obtained by restricting $H_{a}$ to the level set $J_{2,a}^{-1}(b)$, which is where $p_{y}=b$.\n$H_{a,b} = H_{a}(y, b) = \\frac{1}{2m}(a^{2}+b^{2})$.\nThis is a constant function on the final reduced space (a point), and its value is identical to the one obtained by the full reduction.\n\nThe common reduced Hamiltonian is the constant value $\\frac{1}{2m}(a^{2}+b^{2})$.",

The configuration space is $Q^{\\circ}=\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$, which is naturally described by polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ where $r \\in (0, \\infty)$ and $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The group $G=\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ acts on $Q^{\\circ}$ by rotation: for an element of $G$ corresponding to an angle $\\phi$, the action is $(r, \\theta) \\mapsto (r, \\theta+\\phi)$. This action is free and proper. The Lie algebra is $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{so}(2) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$. We choose a basis element $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ corresponding to $1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The infinitesimal generator of the action on $Q^{\\circ}$ corresponding to $\\xi$ is the vector field $\\xi_{Q^{\\circ}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}$.\n\nThe phase space is the cotangent bundle $T^{*}Q^{\\circ}$, with canonical local coordinates $(r, \\theta, p_r, p_\\theta)$. The canonical one-form is $\\Theta = p_r dr + p_\\theta d\\theta$, and the canonical symplectic two-form is $\\omega = -d\\Theta = dr \\wedge dp_r + d\\theta \\wedge dp_\\theta$. The standard Poisson brackets are $\\{r, p_r\\} = 1$, $\\{\\theta, p_\\theta\\} = 1$, and all others zero.\n\nThe momentum map $J: T^{*}Q^{\\circ} \\to \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$ for a cotangent-lifted action is defined by the pairing $\\langle J(\\alpha_q), \\xi \\rangle = \\langle \\alpha_q, \\xi_{Q^{\\circ}}(q) \\rangle$ for a covector $\\alpha_q \\in T_q^{*}Q^{\\circ}$. With $\\alpha_q = p_r dr + p_\\theta d\\theta$ and $\\xi_{Q^{\\circ}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}$, we have $\\langle J(r, \\theta, p_r, p_\\theta), \\xi \\rangle = (p_r dr + p_\\theta d\\theta)(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}) = p_\\theta$. Identifying $\\mathfrak{g}^{*}$ with $\\mathbb{R}$, the momentum map is $J = p_\\theta$, as stated in the problem.\n\nWe perform reduction at a regular value $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $\\mu \\neq 0$. The level set of the momentum map is $J^{-1}(\\mu) = \\{(r, \\theta, p_r, p_\\theta) \\in T^{*}Q^{\\circ} \\mid p_\\theta = \\mu\\}$. Since $G=\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ is abelian, the coadjoint action is trivial, and the isotropy subgroup $G_\\mu$ for any $\\mu$ is $G$ itself. The reduced space is $P_\\mu = J^{-1}(\\mu)/G$.\n\nThe problem directs us to use the formalism of reduction in stages, employing a connection on the principal bundle $\\pi: Q^{\\circ} \\to Q^{\\circ}/G$. The base space is the space of orbits, $Q^{\\circ}/G$, which is identified with the set of radii $(0, \\infty)$ coordinatized by $r$. The projection is $\\pi(r, \\theta) = r$. The reduced phase space $P_\\mu$ can be identified with a bundle over $T^{*}(Q^{\\circ}/G)$, and its symplectic form $\\omega_\\mu$ is determined by the minimal coupling procedure. The general formula for the reduced symplectic form on $T^{*}(Q^{\\circ}/G)$, whose elements are denoted $(r, p_r)$, is\n$$\n\\omega_\\mu = \\omega_{Q/G} - \\langle \\mu, \\mathcal{B} \\rangle\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_{Q/G} = dp_r \\wedge dr$ is the canonical symplectic form on $T^{*}(Q^{\\circ}/G)$, and $\\mathcal{B}$ is the curvature two-form of the chosen connection pulled back to $T^*(Q/G)$. The term $\\langle \\mu, \\mathcal{B} \\rangle$ represents the \"magnetic\" or \"twist\" term.\n\nA critical observation is that the base manifold $Q^{\\circ}/G \\cong (0, \\infty)$ is one-dimensional. A two-form on a one-dimensional manifold, such as $\\mathcal{B}$, must be identically zero. Therefore, irrespective of the choice of connection, the curvature term $\\langle \\mu, \\mathcal{B} \\rangle$ must vanish. This provides a direct path to the solution.\n\nFor completeness, we will explicitly compute the curvature for the specified mechanical connection. The metric on $Q^{\\circ}$ inherited from the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is $ds^2 = dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2$. The mechanical connection defines the horizontal subspace $H_q$ at a point $q \\in Q^{\\circ}$ as the orthogonal complement of the vertical subspace $V_q = \\mathrm{span}\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}\\}$ with respect to this metric. The basis vectors $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}$ are orthogonal with respect to the given metric. Thus, the horizontal space is $H_q = \\mathrm{span}\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\}$.\n\nThe connection one-form $\\mathcal{A}$ is a $\\mathfrak{g}$-valued one-form on $Q^{\\circ}$. It is defined by the conditions that it annihilates horizontal vectors and its value on the infinitesimal generator $\\xi_{Q^{\\circ}}$ is $\\xi$. Using our identification $\\mathfrak{g} \\cong \\mathbb{R}$ with generator $\\xi=1$, we have:\n$1.$ $\\mathcal{A}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}) = 0$, since $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}$ is horizontal.\n$2.$ $\\mathcal{A}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}) = 1$, since $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}$ is the generator $\\xi_{Q^{\\circ}}$.\nThese two conditions uniquely determine the connection one-form as $\\mathcal{A} = d\\theta$.\n\nThe curvature of the connection is given by the $\\mathfrak{g}$-valued two-form $\\pi^*\\mathcal{B} = d\\mathcal{A} + \\frac{1}{2}[\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{A}]$. Since $G=\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ is abelian, its Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is abelian, so the Lie bracket term $[\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{A}]$ vanishes. The curvature is simply $\\pi^*\\mathcal{B} = d\\mathcal{A}$.\nWe compute the exterior derivative of the connection form:\n$$\n\\pi^*\\mathcal{B} = d(d\\theta) = 0\n$$\nWhile $\\theta$ is not a globally defined function on $Q^{\\circ}$, $d\\theta$ is a well-defined (though not exact) one-form on $Q^{\\circ}$. As a one-form, it is closed, meaning its exterior derivative is zero. Thus, the curvature $\\mathcal{B}$ of the mechanical connection is zero.\n\nBoth lines of reasoning—the dimensional argument and the explicit calculation—confirm that $\\mathcal{B} = 0$. Consequently, the magnetic term vanishes, and the reduced symplectic form is identical to the canonical one:\n$$\n\\omega_\\mu = \\omega_{Q/G} = dp_r \\wedge dr\n$$\nThe reduced symplectic form shows no dependence on $\\mu$. The Poisson bracket is derived from the symplectic form matrix. For $\\omega_\\mu = dp_r \\wedge dr$, written in matrix form for coordinates $(r, p_r)$ as $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, the Poisson bracket matrix is its inverse, $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This corresponds to the bracket relation\n$$\n\\{f, g\\}_{\\mathrm{red}, \\mu} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial r}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p_r} - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_r}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial r}\n$$\nWe are asked to compute $\\{r, p_r\\}_{\\mathrm{red, \\mu}}$. Using the formula above:\n$$\n\\{r, p_r\\}_{\\mathrm{red}, \\mu} = \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial r}\\frac{\\partial p_r}{\\partial p_r} - \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial p_r}\\frac{\\partial p_r}{\\partial r} = (1)(1) - (0)(0) = 1\n$$\nThe reduced Poisson bracket is $\\{r, p_r\\}_{\\mathrm{red}, \\mu} = 1$.

You will encounter a non-trivial connection that leads to both a momentum shift and a non-vanishing magnetic term, fundamentally altering the symplectic geometry of the reduced phase space . This exercise challenges you to synthesize your understanding of connections, curvatures, and Lie algebra structures to derive the modified symplectic form that governs the dynamics of the reduced system.",
