This system possesses a natural rotational symmetry, making it an ideal candidate for simplification. By applying the principles of Routh reduction, we will see how the conservation of angular momentum allows us to eliminate the angular degree of freedom, reducing the problem to a one-dimensional motion governed by an \"effective potential\" that includes the famous centrifugal barrier .

            "solution": "**Derivation of the Conserved Quantity**\n\nWe are asked to derive the conserved quantity associated with the symmetry. This quantity is given by the momentum map associated with the action of the Lie group $G=S^1$ on the configuration manifold $Q = \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\times S^{1}$.\n\nThe action of $G=S^1$ on $Q$ is given by $\\Phi: S^1 \\times Q \\to Q$, with $\\Phi_{\\phi}(x,y,\\theta) = (x, y, \\theta+\\phi)$. The Lie algebra of $S^1$ is $\\mathfrak{g} \\cong \\mathbb{R}$. We can choose a basis element $\\xi = 1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The infinitesimal generator of the action corresponding to $\\xi$ is a vector field on $Q$, denoted $\\xi_Q$, defined as:\n$$\n\\xi_Q(q) = \\frac{d}{d\\phi}\\bigg|_{\\phi=0} \\Phi_{\\phi}(q)\n$$\nIn our local coordinates $q=(x,y,\\theta)$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\xi_Q(x,y,\\theta) = \\frac{d}{d\\phi}\\bigg|_{\\phi=0} (x, y, \\theta+\\phi) = (0, 0, 1)\n$$\nIn the coordinate basis $\\{\\partial_x, \\partial_y, \\partial_\\theta\\}$, this vector field is simply $\\xi_Q = \\partial_{\\theta}$.\n\nThe Lagrangian $L: TQ \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defines the dynamics. The Legendre transform, or fiber derivative, $\\mathbb{F}L: TQ \\to T^*Q$, maps velocity vectors in the tangent bundle $TQ$ to momentum covectors in the cotangent bundle $T^*Q$. For a point $(q, \\dot{q}) \\in TQ$, the corresponding momentum $p \\in T^*_q Q$ has components given by:\n$$\np_i = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}^i}\n$$\nwhere $q^i$ are the local coordinates on $Q$.\n\nThe momentum map $J: TQ \\to \\mathfrak{g}^*$ (where $\\mathfrak{g}^*$ is the dual of the Lie algebra) is defined by the pairing:\n$$\n\\langle J(q, \\dot{q}), \\xi \\rangle_{\\mathfrak{g}^* \\times \\mathfrak{g}} = \\langle \\mathbb{F}L(q, \\dot{q}), \\xi_Q(q) \\rangle_{T^*Q \\times TQ}\n$$\nfor any $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{g}$. The right-hand side represents the natural pairing between a covector $\\mathbb{F}L(q, \\dot{q}) = p$ and a vector $\\xi_Q(q)$. In local coordinates, this pairing is $p_i (\\xi_Q)^i$.\n\nFor our system, $\\mathfrak{g}^* \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, so $J(q, \\dot{q})$ is a scalar function. Taking $\\xi=1$ as the basis for $\\mathfrak{g}$, the momentum map is simply the scalar value $J(q, \\dot{q}) = \\langle J(q, \\dot{q}), 1 \\rangle$. The corresponding generator is $\\xi_Q = \\partial_{\\theta}$, which has coordinate components $(\\xi_Q)^x = 0$, $(\\xi_Q)^y = 0$, and $(\\xi_Q)^\\theta = 1$. The definition of the momentum map becomes:\n$$\nJ(q, \\dot{q}) = p_i (\\xi_Q)^i = p_x \\cdot 0 + p_y \\cdot 0 + p_\\theta \\cdot 1 = p_\\theta\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of the canonical momentum $p_\\theta$:\n$$\nJ(q, \\dot{q}) = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}}\n$$\nThis is the conserved quantity associated with the cyclic coordinate $\\theta$. According to Noether's theorem, since the Lagrangian is invariant under the symmetry action (i.e., $\\partial L / \\partial \\theta = 0$), this quantity is conserved along the trajectories of the system. The Euler-Lagrange equation for the $\\theta$ coordinate is $\\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$. Given that $\\partial L / \\partial \\theta = 0$, this simplifies to $\\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} = 0$, which confirms that $J = p_\\theta$ is a constant of motion.\n\n**Explicit Computation of the Momentum Map**\n\nWe now compute this quantity explicitly for the given Lagrangian. The Lagrangian is $L = T - V$, where the kinetic energy $T = \\frac{1}{2}g_{ij}\\dot{q}^i\\dot{q}^j$. Writing this out using the given metric components and coordinates $(q^1, q^2, q^3) = (x, y, \\theta)$:\n$$\nL(x,y,\\theta,\\dot{x},\\dot{y},\\dot{\\theta}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( g_{xx}\\dot{x}^2 + g_{yy}\\dot{y}^2 + g_{\\theta\\theta}\\dot{\\theta}^2 + 2g_{x\\theta}\\dot{x}\\dot{\\theta} + 2g_{y\\theta}\\dot{y}\\dot{\\theta} \\right) - V(x,y)\n$$\nWe have used the fact that $g_{xy}=0$ and the symmetry $g_{ij}=g_{ji}$. Substituting the given expressions for the metric components:\n$$\nL(x,y,\\theta,\\dotx,\\dot{y},\\dot{\\theta}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 + a\\dot{\\theta}^2 + 2(b\\sin(x))\\dot{x}\\dot{\\theta} + 2(c\\cos(y))\\dot{y}\\dot{\\theta} \\right) - V(x,y)\n$$\nWe now compute the momentum map $J$ by taking the partial derivative of $L$ with respect to $\\dot{\\theta}$:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 + a\\dot{\\theta}^2 + 2b\\sin(x)\\dot{x}\\dot{\\theta} + 2c\\cos(y)\\dot{y}\\dot{\\theta} \\right) - V(x,y) \\right]\n$$\nThe terms not containing $\\dot{\\theta}$ differentiate to zero. We are left with:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} \\left( a\\dot{\\theta}^2 + 2b\\sin(x)\\dot{x}\\dot{\\theta} + 2c\\cos(y)\\dot{y}\\dot{\\theta} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nJ = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 2a\\dot{\\theta} + 2b\\sin(x)\\dot{x} + 2c\\cos(y)\\dot{y} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nJ(x,y,\\theta,\\dot{x},\\dot{y},\\dot{\\theta}) = a\\dot{\\theta} + b\\sin(x)\\dot{x} + c\\cos(y)\\dot{y}\n$$\nThis expression represents the conserved momentum associated with the rotational symmetry about the $\\theta$ coordinate.
