            "introduction": "Darboux's theorem assures us that, locally, any symplectic form can be made to look like the standard one. Before tackling the full proof using the Moser path method, it is invaluable to understand the theorem's foundation in linear algebra. This practice  challenges you to do just that: for a constant symplectic form on $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$, you will find an explicit linear change of basis that transforms its matrix representation into the standard canonical form. This is equivalent to constructing a \"Darboux basis\" and provides a concrete understanding of what local equivalence means at the purely algebraic level.",

            "problem": "Let $\\omega$ be a constant symplectic $2$-form on $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ with global coordinates $(q_{1},q_{2},p_{1},p_{2})$ and suppose that, in these coordinates, $\\omega$ is represented by the skew-symmetric, nondegenerate matrix $W$ via the identification $\\omega(u,v)=u^{\\top}Wv$ for tangent vectors $u$ and $v$. The standard symplectic form $\\omega_{0}$ corresponds to the matrix $J=\\begin{pmatrix}0 & I_{2}\\\\ -I_{2} & 0\\end{pmatrix}$, where $I_{2}$ is the $2\\times 2$ identity matrix. In the linear-algebraic shadow of the Moser path method for Darboux's theorem, a linear change of variables $x=S\\,y$ with $S\\in\\mathrm{GL}(4,\\mathbb{R})$ transforms the matrix of $\\omega$ by congruence to $S^{\\top}WS$.\n\nConsider the constant symplectic form whose matrix in the ordered basis $(q_{1},q_{2},p_{1},p_{2})$ is\n$$\nW=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 2 & 1\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 3\\\\\n-2 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n-1 & -3 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nConstruct explicitly a linear change of variables $x=S\\,y$ such that $S^{\\top}WS=J$.

We can express $W$ and $J$ in a $2 \\times 2$ block form based on this partition. Let $0_2$ be the $2 \\times 2$ zero matrix and $I_2$ be the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix. The matrix $W$ has the form\n$$\nW = \\begin{pmatrix} 0_2 & A \\\\ -A^{\\top} & 0_2 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe standard matrix $J$ has the same block structure: $J = \\begin{pmatrix} 0_2 & I_2 \\\\ -I_2 & 0_2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nWe seek a solution for $S$ that respects this block structure, such as a block-diagonal matrix of the form:\n$$\nS = \\begin{pmatrix} S_q & 0_2 \\\\ 0_2 & S_p \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the congruence equation $S^{\\top}WS=J$:\n$$\nS^{\\top}WS = \n\\begin{pmatrix} S_q^{\\top} & 0_2 \\\\ 0_2 & S_p^{\\top} \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0_2 & A \\\\ -A^{\\top} & 0_2 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} S_q & 0_2 \\\\ 0_2 & S_p \\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix} 0_2 & S_q^{\\top} A S_p \\\\ -S_p^{\\top} A^{\\top} S_q & 0_2 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nFor this to equal $J$, we must satisfy the condition $S_q^{\\top} A S_p = I_2$. A simple way to solve this is to choose one of the blocks to be the identity. Let's set $S_q = I_2$. The condition simplifies to $A S_p = I_2$, which means $S_p = A^{-1}$.\n\nWe compute the inverse of $A$:\n$$\n\\det(A) = (2)(3) - (1)(0) = 6.\n$$\n$$\nA^{-1} = \\frac{1}{6} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & -1/6 \\\\ 0 & 1/3 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThus, we have $S_q = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $S_p = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & -1/6 \\\\ 0 & 1/3 \\end{pmatrix}$.

While Darboux's theorem tells us all symplectic manifolds look the same locally, this does not mean any arbitrary transformation is a valid one.
