            "solution": "The problem presents a one-parameter family of skew-symmetric bilinear forms $\\omega_t: V \\times V \\to \\mathbb{R}$ on a $6$-dimensional real vector space $V$, represented by the matrix $A(t)$ in a fixed basis. We are tasked with determining the values of the parameter $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ for which $\\omega_t$ is nondegenerate, describing the variation of its rank and canonical structure, and identifying the bifurcation points.\n\nA bilinear form is defined as nondegenerate if its representing matrix is invertible. A square matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is non-zero. Our first step is to compute the determinant of the given matrix $A(t)$:\n$$\nA(t) \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  t-1  0  0  0  0\\\\\n-(t-1)  0  0  0  0  0\\\\\n0  0  0  t+1  0  0\\\\\n0  0  -(t+1)  0  0  0\\\\\n0  0  0  0  0  t-2\\\\\n0  0  0  0  -(t-2)  0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe matrix $A(t)$ is block-diagonal, composed of three $2 \\times 2$ blocks. Let us denote them by $A_1(t)$, $A_2(t)$, and $A_3(t)$:\n$$\nA_1(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  t-1 \\\\ -(t-1)  0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\nA_2(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  t+1 \\\\ -(t+1)  0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\nA_3(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  t-2 \\\\ -(t-2)  0 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe determinant of a block-diagonal matrix is the product of the determinants of its diagonal blocks. We calculate the determinant of each block:\n$$\n\\det(A_1(t)) = (0)(0) - (t-1)(-(t-1)) = (t-1)^2\n$$\n$$\n\\det(A_2(t)) = (0)(0) - (t+1)(-(t+1)) = (t+1)^2\n$$\n$$\n\\det(A_3(t)) = (0)(0) - (t-2)(-(t-2)) = (t-2)^2\n$$\nThe determinant of $A(t)$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\det(A(t)) = \\det(A_1(t)) \\cdot \\det(A_2(t)) \\cdot \\det(A_3(t)) = (t-1)^2 (t+1)^2 (t-2)^2.\n$$\nThe bilinear form $\\omega_t$ is nondegenerate if and only if $\\det(A(t)) \\neq 0$. Conversely, $\\omega_t$ is degenerate if and only if $\\det(A(t)) = 0$. This condition is met when:\n$$\n(t-1)^2 (t+1)^2 (t-2)^2 = 0.\n$$\nThe real solutions to this equation are $t=1$, $t=-1$, and $t=2$. These are the bifurcation points at which the form $\\omega_t$ loses nondegeneracy. For any other real value of $t$, i.e., for $t \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{-1, 1, 2\\}$, the form $\\omega_t$ is nondegenerate.\n\nNext, we analyze the rank and canonical structure of $\\omega_t$ as a function of $t$. The rank of a skew-symmetric matrix over any field is always an even integer. For a real skew-symmetric matrix of rank $2k$ and size $n \\times n$, its canonical form under congruence is a block-diagonal matrix with $k$ copies of the standard $2 \\times 2$ symplectic block $\\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ -1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and an $(n-2k) \\times (n-2k)$ zero block. The number of symplectic blocks is thus half of the rank.\n\nCase 1: $t \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{-1, 1, 2\\}$\nIn this regime, $\\det(A(t)) \\neq 0$, which means the matrix $A(t)$ is of full rank. Since $A(t)$ is a $6 \\times 6$ matrix, its rank is $6$.\n$$\n\\text{rank}(A(t)) = 6.\n$$\nThe bilinear form $\\omega_t$ is a symplectic form. The number of canonical symplectic blocks is $k = \\frac{\\text{rank}(A(t))}{2} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3$. The null space is trivial, with dimension $6-6=0$.\n\nCase 2: $t \\in \\{-1, 1, 2\\}$\nAt these bifurcation points, the form $\\omega_t$ is degenerate. We determine the rank by examining the ranks of the individual blocks, as the rank of a block-diagonal matrix is the sum of the ranks of its blocks. A $2 \\times 2$ matrix of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} 0  a \\\\ -a  0 \\end{pmatrix}$ has rank $2$ if $a \\neq 0$ and rank $0$ if $a=0$.\n\nSubcase 2.1: $t=1$\nThe term $t-1$ becomes $0$. The blocks are:\n$A_1(1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix}$, so $\\text{rank}(A_1(1)) = 0$.\n$A_2(1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  2 \\\\ -2  0 \\end{pmatrix}$, so $\\text{rank}(A_2(1)) = 2$.\n$A_3(1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$, so $\\text{rank}(A_3(1)) = 2$.\nThe total rank is $\\text{rank}(A(1)) = 0 + 2 + 2 = 4$.\nThe number of symplectic blocks is $k = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$. The dimension of the null space is $6-4=2$.\n\nSubcase 2.2: $t=-1$\nThe term $t+1$ becomes $0$. The blocks are:\n$A_1(-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -2 \\\\ 2  0 \\end{pmatrix}$, so $\\text{rank}(A_1(-1)) = 2$.\n$A_2(-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix}$, so $\\text{rank}(A_2(-1)) = 0$.\n$A_3(-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -3 \\\\ 3  0 \\end{pmatrix}$, so $\\text{rank}(A_3(-1)) = 2$.\nThe total rank is $\\text{rank}(A(-1)) = 2 + 0 + 2 = 4$.\nThe canonical structure is the same as for $t=1$: $2$ symplectic blocks and a $2$-dimensional null space.\n\nSubcase 2.3: $t=2$\nThe term $t-2$ becomes $0$. The blocks are:\n$A_1(2) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ -1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$, so $\\text{rank}(A_1(2)) = 2$.\n$A_2(2) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  3 \\\\ -3  0 \\end{pmatrix}$, so $\\text{rank}(A_2(2)) = 2$.\n$A_3(2) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix}$, so $\\text{rank}(A_3(2)) = 0$.\nThe total rank is $\\text{rank}(A(2)) = 2 + 2 + 0 = 4$.\nThe canonical structure is again the same: $2$ symplectic blocks and a $2$-dimensional null space.\n\nIn summary, the bilinear form $\\omega_t$ is nondegenerate with rank $6$ for all $t$ except $t=-1, 1, 2$. At these three distinct values, a bifurcation occurs, nondegeneracy is lost, and the rank of the form drops to $4$.\n\nThe problem asks for the complete set of real parameter values $t$ at which $\\omega_t$ fails to be nondegenerate. These are precisely the bifurcation points we have identified: $t=-1$, $t=1$, and $t=2$.",
