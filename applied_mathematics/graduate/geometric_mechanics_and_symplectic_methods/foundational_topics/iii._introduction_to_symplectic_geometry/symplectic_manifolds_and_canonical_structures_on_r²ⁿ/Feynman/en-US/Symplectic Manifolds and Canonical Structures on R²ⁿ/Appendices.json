The space $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is endowed with the canonical symplectic form $\\omega_{0}(u,v) = u^{\\top} J v$ where $J = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ -1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$, and the standard Euclidean metric $g(u,v) = u^{\\top} v$.\n\nFirst, we verify that $S_{a}$ preserves the symplectic form $\\omega_{0}$. The problem requires using the fundamental definition $\\omega_{0}(S_{a} u, S_{a} v) = \\omega_{0}(u,v)$ for all $u, v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\nLet $u = \\begin{pmatrix} q_{1} \\\\ p_{1} \\end{pmatrix}$ and $v = \\begin{pmatrix} q_{2} \\\\ p_{2} \\end{pmatrix}$ be two arbitrary vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\nThe value of the symplectic form on these vectors is:\n$$\n\\omega_{0}(u,v) = u^{\\top} J v = \\begin{pmatrix} q_{1}  p_{1} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ -1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} q_{2} \\\\ p_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} q_{1}  p_{1} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} p_{2} \\\\ -q_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = q_{1}p_{2} - p_{1}q_{2}\n$$\nNow, we apply the transformation $S_{a}$ to both vectors:\n$$\nS_{a} u = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ a  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} q_{1} \\\\ p_{1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} q_{1} \\\\ aq_{1} + p_{1} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nS_{a} v = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ a  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} q_{2} \\\\ p_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} q_{2} \\\\ aq_{2} + p_{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the symplectic form on the transformed vectors:\n$$\n\\omega_{0}(S_{a} u, S_{a} v) = (S_{a} u)^{\\top} J (S_{a} v) = \\begin{pmatrix} q_{1}  aq_{1} + p_{1} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ -1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} q_{2} \\\\ aq_{2} + p_{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_{0}(S_{a} u, S_{a} v) = \\begin{pmatrix} q_{1}  aq_{1} + p_{1} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} aq_{2} + p_{2} \\\\ -q_{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_{0}(S_{a} u, S_{a} v) = q_{1}(aq_{2} + p_{2}) - (aq_{1} + p_{1})q_{2} = aq_{1}q_{2} + q_{1}p_{2} - aq_{1}q_{2} - p_{1}q_{2} = q_{1}p_{2} - p_{1}q_{2}\n$$\nComparing the results, we find that $\\omega_{0}(S_{a} u, S_{a} v) = \\omega_{0}(u,v)$, which verifies that the map $S_{a}$ is a symplectomorphism.\n\nSecond, we verify that $S_{a}$ is not orthogonal with respect to the Euclidean metric $g$ for $a \\neq 0$. A linear transformation $S$ is orthogonal if and only if it preserves the inner product, i.e., $g(Su, Sv) = g(u,v)$ for all vectors $u, v$. We can show this is not the case by finding a counterexample.\nLet us choose the standard basis vector $u = e_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe metric evaluated on this vector with itself is its squared norm:\n$$\ng(e_{1}, e_{1}) = e_{1}^{\\top} e_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 1\n$$\nNow, we apply the transformation $S_{a}$ to $e_{1}$:\n$$\nS_{a} e_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ a  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ a \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the metric for the transformed vector:\n$$\ng(S_{a} e_{1}, S_{a} e_{1}) = (S_{a} e_{1})^{\\top} (S_{a} e_{1}) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  a \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ a \\end{pmatrix} = 1^{2} + a^{2} = 1+a^{2}\n$$\nThe condition for orthogonality would require $g(S_{a} e_{1}, S_{a} e_{1}) = g(e_{1}, e_{1})$, which means $1+a^{2} = 1$. This implies $a^{2}=0$, and therefore $a=0$. However, the problem specifies that $a \\neq 0$. Thus, for any $a \\neq 0$, we have $g(S_{a} e_{1}, S_{a} e_{1}) = 1+a^{2} \\neq 1 = g(e_{1}, e_{1})$. This demonstrates that $S_{a}$ is not an orthogonal transformation for $a \\neq 0$.\n\nThird, we compute the scalar $g(S_{a} e_{1}, S_{a} e_{1})$ as a closed-form expression in terms of $a$. This calculation was performed in the second step to demonstrate non-orthogonality. We repeat it here for completeness as the final part of the problem.\nThe vector $e_{1}$ is given by $e_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nApplying the map $S_{a}$ gives:\n$$\nS_{a} e_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ a  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ a \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe scalar $g(S_{a} e_{1}, S_{a} e_{1})$ is computed using the definition of the metric $g(u,v) = u^{\\top}v$:\n$$\ng(S_{a} e_{1}, S_{a} e_{1}) = \\left(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ a \\end{pmatrix}\\right)^{\\top} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ a \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  a \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ a \\end{pmatrix} = 1 \\cdot 1 + a \\cdot a = 1+a^{2}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression.",

The equations of motion are $\\dot{z}(t) = X_H(z(t))$, which in coordinates are:\n$$ \\dot{q}^i = 0 $$\n$$ \\dot{p}_i = c_i $$\nIntegrating these equations from an initial state $(q_0, p_0)$ at $t=0$, we obtain the flow:\n$$ q^i(t) = q_0^i $$\n$$ p_i(t) = p_{0i} + c_i t $$\nThe flow map is therefore $\\varphi_t(q_0, p_0) = (q_0, p_0 + t c)$. Evaluating at $t=1$:\n$$ \\varphi_1(q_0, p_0) = (q_0, p_0 + c) = \\Phi_c(q_0, p_0) $$\nThis demonstrates that $\\Phi_c$ is the time-$1$ map of a Hamiltonian flow. Since Hamiltonian flows are composed of symplectomorphisms and $\\Phi_c$ is a diffeomorphism (with inverse $\\Phi_{-c}$), it is a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism.

For any point $(q,p) \\in B_R$, we have $\\sum_{j=1}^{n} (q_j^2 + p_j^2)  R^2$. Since all terms in the sum are non-negative, this implies $q_1^2 + p_1^2 \\le \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (q_j^2 + p_j^2)  R^2$. Therefore, any point in $B_R$ is also in $Z_R$, which means $B_R \\subset Z_R$.\nThe inclusion map $i: B_R \\hookrightarrow Z_R$ is a smooth embedding. Since $B_R$ is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ and $\\omega_0$ is the standard form on the entire space, the pullback of $\\omega_0$ under the inclusion map is simply the restriction of $\\omega_0$ to $B_R$, which is $\\omega_0$ itself. Thus, $i$ is a symplectic embedding.\nNow, suppose there exists a symplectic embedding $\\varphi: (B_\\rho, \\omega_0) \\hookrightarrow (B_R, \\omega_0)$. We can compose this with the inclusion $i: (B_R, \\omega_0) \\hookrightarrow (Z_R, \\omega_0)$. The problem states that the composition of symplectic embeddings is symplectic. Therefore, the map $i \\circ \\varphi: (B_\\rho, \\omega_0) \\hookrightarrow (Z_R, \\omega_0)$ is a symplectic embedding.\nNow we can apply the Gromov non-squeezing theorem to the embedding $i \\circ \\varphi$. The theorem states that for a symplectic embedding from $(B_\\rho, \\omega_0)$ to $(Z_r, \\omega_0)$, we must have $\\rho \\le r$. In our case, the target cylinder is $Z_R$, so we must have $\\rho \\le R$.\nThis shows that for any $\\rho$ for which an embedding into $B_R$ exists, it must satisfy $\\rho \\le R$.

Consider the inclusion map $j: B_{\\rho'} \\hookrightarrow B_R$. Since $\\rho'  R$, $B_{\\rho'}$ is a proper open subset of $B_R$. The inclusion map is a smooth embedding. As argued before, because it is an inclusion of open subsets of $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ equipped with the standard symplectic form $\\omega_0$, it is a symplectic embedding ($j^*\\omega_0 = \\omega_0$).\nThis means that for any $\\rho'  R$, there exists a symplectic embedding of $(B_{\\rho'}, \\omega_0)$ into $(B_R, \\omega_0)$. Therefore, the set $\\{\\pi\\rho^2 : \\dots\\}$ over which the supremum is taken contains the set $\\{\\pi(\\rho')^2 : 0  \\rho'  R\\}$. The supremum of this set is $\\pi R^2$.

This provides a direct upper bound on $\\rho$. Therefore, the supremum of $\\pi\\rho^2$ must be less than or equal to $\\pi r^2$. So, $c_G(Z_r) \\le \\pi r^2$.\n\nTo establish a lower bound, we must show that for any $\\rho'  r$, it is possible to symplectically embed $B_{\\rho'}$ into $Z_r$. Consider any point $(q,p) \\in B_{\\rho'}$. By definition, $\\sum_{j=1}^{n} (q_j^2 + p_j^2)  (\\rho')^2$. This implies that $q_1^2 + p_1^2 \\le \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (q_j^2 + p_j^2)  (\\rho')^2$. Since we chose $\\rho'  r$, it follows that $q_1^2 + p_1^2  r^2$. This means that any point in $B_{\\rho'}$ is also in $Z_r$, i.e., $B_{\\rho'} \\subset Z_r$.\nTherefore, the inclusion map $k: B_{\\rho'} \\hookrightarrow Z_r$ is a well-defined smooth embedding. For the same reasons as before, this inclusion map is a symplectic embedding.\nThis demonstrates that for any $\\rho'  r$, an embedding exists. Hence, the set $\\{\\pi\\rho^2 : \\dots\\}$ contains the set $\\{\\pi(\\rho')^2 : 0  \\rho'  r\\}$. The supremum of this set is $\\pi r^2$.
