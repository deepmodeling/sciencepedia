Recall the following foundational notions: a $2$-form $\\omega$ is called closed if $\\mathrm{d}\\omega = 0$, the kernel of $\\omega$ at a point $p \\in M$ is the subspace $\\ker(\\omega_{p}) = \\{v \\in T_{p}M \\mid \\iota_{v}\\omega_{p} = 0\\}$ where $\\iota_{v}$ denotes the interior product, and given a smooth function $H \\colon M \\to \\mathbb{R}$, a Hamiltonian vector field $X_{H}$ with respect to $\\omega$ is any vector field satisfying $\\iota_{X_{H}}\\omega = \\mathrm{d}H$.

            "solution": "The problem is analyzed in four parts as requested.\n\n1. To verify that the $2$-form $\\omega = \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y$ on $M = \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is closed, we must compute its exterior derivative $\\mathrm{d}\\omega$ and show it is the zero $3$-form. The exterior derivative operator $\\mathrm{d}$ on a manifold is nilpotent, meaning $\\mathrm{d} \\circ \\mathrm{d} = \\mathrm{d}^{2} = 0$. For any smooth function $f$, $\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}f) = 0$. The coordinates $x$ and $y$ are smooth functions on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, so $\\mathrm{d}x$ and $\\mathrm{d}y$ are exact $1$-forms. Using the graded Leibniz rule for the exterior derivative, which states that for a $p$-form $\\alpha$ and any form $\\beta$, $\\mathrm{d}(\\alpha \\wedge \\beta) = (\\mathrm{d}\\alpha) \\wedge \\beta + (-1)^{p} \\alpha \\wedge (\\mathrm{d}\\beta)$, we can compute $\\mathrm{d}\\omega$. Here, $\\omega = \\alpha \\wedge \\beta$ with $\\alpha = \\mathrm{d}x$ being a $1$-form (so $p=1$) and $\\beta = \\mathrm{d}y$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\omega = \\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y) = (\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}x)) \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y - \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge (\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}y))\n$$\nSince $x$ and $y$ are scalar functions (0-forms), $\\mathrm{d}x$ and $\\mathrm{d}y$ are their exterior derivatives. Thus, $\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}x) = 0$ and $\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}y) = 0$. Substituting these into the expression gives:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\omega = 0 \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y - \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge 0 = 0\n$$\nThis demonstrates that $\\omega$ is a closed $2$-form.\n\n2. To compute the kernel of $\\omega$ at an arbitrary point $p \\in M$, we consider the tangent space $T_{p}M$. The standard basis for $T_{p}M$ is given by the set of vector fields $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}|_{p}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}|_{p}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}|_{p}\\}$. For brevity, we will omit the subscript $p$. An arbitrary tangent vector $v \\in T_{p}M$ can be written as $v = v_{x} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + v_{y} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + v_{z} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$ for some real coefficients $v_{x}, v_{y}, v_{z}$. By definition, $v$ is in the kernel of $\\omega_{p}$ if and only if the interior product $\\iota_{v}\\omega_{p}$ is the zero $1$-form. We compute this interior product:\n$$\n\\iota_{v}\\omega = \\iota_{v_{x} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + v_{y} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + v_{z} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}} (\\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y)\n$$\nUsing the linearity of the interior product, we have:\n$$\n\\iota_{v}\\omega = v_{x} \\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}}(\\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y) + v_{y} \\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}}(\\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y) + v_{z} \\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}}(\\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y)\n$$\nWe evaluate each term using the property $\\iota_{X}(\\alpha \\wedge \\beta) = (\\iota_{X}\\alpha)\\wedge\\beta - \\alpha\\wedge(\\iota_{X}\\beta)$ and the duality $\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}}\\mathrm{d}x^{j} = \\delta_{i}^{j}$:\n$$\n\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}}(\\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y) = (\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}}\\mathrm{d}x) \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y - \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge (\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}}\\mathrm{d}y) = 1 \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y - \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge 0 = \\mathrm{d}y\n$$\n$$\n\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}}(\\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y) = (\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}}\\mathrm{d}x) \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y - \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge (\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}}\\mathrm{d}y) = 0 \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y - \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge 1 = -\\mathrm{d}x\n$$\n$$\n\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}}(\\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y) = (\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}}\\mathrm{d}x) \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y - \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge (\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}}\\mathrm{d}y) = 0 \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y - \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge 0 = 0\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $\\iota_{v}\\omega$:\n$$\n\\iota_{v}\\omega = v_{x}(\\mathrm{d}y) + v_{y}(-\\mathrm{d}x) + v_{z}(0) = -v_{y}\\mathrm{d}x + v_{x}\\mathrm{d}y\n$$\nFor $v$ to be in $\\ker(\\omega_{p})$, we must have $\\iota_{v}\\omega = 0$. This means $-v_{y}\\mathrm{d}x + v_{x}\\mathrm{d}y = 0$. Since $\\{\\mathrm{d}x, \\mathrm{d}y, \\mathrm{d}z\\}$ form a basis for the cotangent space $T_{p}^{*}M$, the coefficients of the basis forms must be zero. This requires $v_{x} = 0$ and $v_{y} = 0$. The component $v_{z}$ is unconstrained. Thus, any vector in the kernel must be of the form $v = v_{z} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$. The kernel is therefore the subspace spanned by the vector $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$:\n$$\n\\ker(\\omega_{p}) = \\mathrm{span}\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}|_{p}\\right\\}\n$$\nSince the kernel is spanned by a single non-zero vector, its dimension is $1$.\n\n3. We analyze the existence and uniqueness of a Hamiltonian vector field $X_{H}$ for a given function $H$, using the defining equation $\\iota_{X_{H}}\\omega = \\mathrm{d}H$. Let $X_{H}$ be a general vector field $X_{H} = X_{x}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + X_{y}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + X_{z}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$. From our calculation in part 2, we have $\\iota_{X_{H}}\\omega = -X_{y}\\mathrm{d}x + X_{x}\\mathrm{d}y$. The defining equation becomes:\n$$\n-X_{y}\\mathrm{d}x + X_{x}\\mathrm{d}y = \\mathrm{d}H = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x}\\mathrm{d}x + \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y}\\mathrm{d}y + \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial z}\\mathrm{d}z\n$$\nBy comparing the coefficients of the basis $1$-forms $\\mathrm{d}x$, $\\mathrm{d}y$, and $\\mathrm{d}z$, we get a system of equations for the components of $X_{H}$:\n$$\n-X_{y} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x} \\implies X_{y} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x}\n$$\n$$\nX_{x} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y}\n$$\n$$\n0 = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial z}\n$$\nCase $H(x,y,z) = x$: We have $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x} = 1$, $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y} = 0$, and $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial z} = 0$. The conditions become $X_{y} = -1$, $X_{x} = 0$, and $0 = 0$. The condition on $H$ is satisfied, so a Hamiltonian vector field exists. The components are $X_{x} = 0$ and $X_{y} = -1$. The component $X_{z}$ is completely undetermined. Thus, any vector field of the form $X_{H} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + f(x,y,z)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$ for any smooth function $f$ is a valid Hamiltonian vector field. Existence is guaranteed, but uniqueness is not.\n\nCase $H(x,y,z) = z$: We have $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x} = 0$, $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y} = 0$, and $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial z} = 1$. The consistency condition $0 = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial z}$ becomes $0=1$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, for $H(x,y,z) = z$, no Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ can exist.\n\nThe degeneracy of $\\omega$, characterized by its non-trivial kernel, is the root cause of these issues. A solution $X_H$ exists if and only if $\\mathrm{d}H$ is in the image of the map $v \\mapsto \\iota_v\\omega$. This image is the set of $1$-forms spanned by $\\{\\mathrm{d}x, \\mathrm{d}y\\}$. This requires that the component of $\\mathrm{d}H$ along $\\mathrm{d}z$ must be zero, which is precisely the condition $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial z} = \\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}}\\mathrm{d}H = 0$. This condition reflects that for $\\mathrm{d}H$ to be in the image of the map associated with $\\omega$, it must be \"annihilated\" by the kernel of $\\omega$. When a solution exists, it is determined only up to the addition of a vector field whose values lie in the kernel of $\\omega$. Since $\\ker(\\omega)$ is non-trivial (of dimension $1$), the solution $X_H$ is never unique.\n\n4. The rank of the bilinear form $\\omega_p$ at any point $p$ is an invariant quantity under diffeomorphisms. The rank is defined as the dimension of the domain minus the dimension of the kernel. For $\\omega_p$ on the $3$-dimensional tangent space $T_pM$, we found $\\dim(\\ker(\\omega_p)) = 1$. Thus, the rank of $\\omega_p$ is $\\dim(T_pM) - \\dim(\\ker(\\omega_p)) = 3 - 1 = 2$.\nA local coordinate change is a diffeomorphism, which induces an isomorphism on each tangent space. The matrix representation of the $2$-form in the new coordinates is related to the old one by a congruence transformation, which preserves rank. Therefore, the rank of $\\omega$ must be $2$ in any local coordinate system.\nFor a $2$-form on a manifold to be non-degenerate (i.e., to be a symplectic form), its rank must be equal to the dimension of the manifold, which must be even. In our case, for $\\omega$ to be non-degenerate on $M=\\mathbb{R}^3$, its rank would have to be $3$. However, we have established that its rank is $2$. This is a coordinate-invariant fact. No coordinate transformation can change the rank from $2$ to $3$. Consequently, it is impossible to find local coordinates in which $\\omega$ becomes non-degenerate. The existence of a non-trivial kernel is an intrinsic, geometric property of $\\omega$, not an artifact of a particular coordinate choice. This is an obstruction to a standard Darboux's theorem, which would require the form to be non-degenerate (and thus of maximal rank). The generalized Darboux theorem for presymplectic forms guarantees that one can find coordinates $(q,p,z)$ such that $\\omega = \\mathrm{d}q \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p$, but the \"kernel coordinate\" $z$ cannot be eliminated. The existence of the kernel is an essential part of the normal form itself.",

To determine its geometry, we can write it in the standard form $\\dfrac{x^2}{a^2} + \\dfrac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$:\n$$\n\\dfrac{q^2}{\\left(\\dfrac{2E}{m\\omega^{2}}\\right)} + \\dfrac{p^2}{2mE} = 1\n$$\nThis identifies the squares of the semi-axes of the ellipse. The semi-axis along the $q$-axis is $q_{\\text{max}} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{2E}{m\\omega^2}}$, and the semi-axis along the $p$-axis is $p_{\\text{max}} = \\sqrt{2mE}$.\n\nThe first objective is to compute the action variable $I$, defined as:\n$$\nI = \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi}\\oint p\\,\\mathrm{d}q\n$$\nThe integral $\\oint p\\,\\mathrm{d}q$ represents the area enclosed by the closed orbit in phase space. For an elliptical path, this area is given by the formula $\\mathcal{A} = \\pi \\times (\\text{semi-axis in } q) \\times (\\text{semi-axis in } p)$.\nUsing the semi-axes identified above, the area is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A} = \\oint p\\,\\mathrm{d}q = \\pi \\left( \\sqrt{\\dfrac{2E}{m\\omega^2}} \\right) \\left( \\sqrt{2mE} \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A} = \\pi \\sqrt{\\left(\\dfrac{2E}{m\\omega^2}\\right)(2mE)} = \\pi \\sqrt{\\dfrac{4mE^2}{m\\omega^2}} = \\pi \\sqrt{\\dfrac{4E^2}{\\omega^2}}\n$$\nSince $E>0$ and $\\omega>0$, we can take the square root to find:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A} = \\pi \\dfrac{2E}{\\omega}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this area back into the definition of the action variable $I$:\n$$\nI = \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi} \\mathcal{A} = \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\pi \\dfrac{2E}{\\omega} \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the first required result, the action variable as a function of energy:\n$$\nI(E, \\omega) = \\dfrac{E}{\\omega}\n$$\nIt is noteworthy that the action variable depends on the energy $E$ and the frequency $\\omega$, but not on the mass $m$.\n\nThe second objective is to express the Hamiltonian $H$ as a function of the action variable $I$ and $\\omega$. From the relationship derived above, we can express the energy $E$ in terms of $I$ and $\\omega$:\n$$\nE = I \\omega\n$$\nSince the value of the Hamiltonian function $H(q,p)$ on any trajectory is the constant energy $E$ of that trajectory, we can express the Hamiltonian in terms of the new coordinate $I$. This is the essence of the transformation to action-angle coordinates. Thus, the Hamiltonian function, when expressed in terms of the action $I$, is:\n$$\nH(I, \\omega) = I\\omega\n$$\nThis result shows that in the action-angle coordinate system, the Hamiltonian for the harmonic oscillator depends linearly on the action variable, which implies that the frequency of motion, $\\dfrac{\\partial H}{\\partial I} = \\omega$, is constant and independent of the energy, a defining characteristic of the simple harmonic oscillator.\n\nThe two requested results are $I(E,m,\\omega) = \\dfrac{E}{\\omega}$ and $H(I,\\omega) = I\\omega$.",
