Construction of the Poisson bivector field $\\Pi$ and the map $\\Pi^{\\#}$**\n\nThe Poisson manifold is $(\\mathbb{R}^{3}, \\{\\cdot,\\cdot\\})$ with global Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$. The Poisson bracket is defined by the relations:\n$$\n\\{x,y\\} = 0 \\\\\n\\{x,z\\} = x \\\\\n\\{y,z\\} = y\n$$\nBy the skew-symmetry property of the Poisson bracket, we also have $\\{y,x\\}=0$, $\\{z,x\\}=-x$, and $\\{z,y\\}=-y$. The brackets of any coordinate with itself are zero, e.g., $\\{x,x\\}=0$.\n\nThe Poisson bivector field $\\Pi$ is a section of the exterior bundle $\\Lambda^{2}(T\\mathbb{R}^{3})$, which in local coordinates $(x^1, x^2, x^3) = (x, y, z)$ is expressed as:\n$$\n\\Pi = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j=1}^{3} \\Pi^{ij} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}\n$$\nwhere the components $\\Pi^{ij}$ are given by the Poisson brackets of the coordinate functions, $\\Pi^{ij} = \\{x^i, x^j\\}$.\n\nUsing the given bracket relations, we construct the matrix of components $\\Pi_{matrix}$:\n$$\n\\Pi_{matrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\{x,x\\}  \\{x,y\\}  \\{x,z\\} \\\\ \\{y,x\\}  \\{y,y\\}  \\{y,z\\} \\\\ \\{z,x\\}  \\{z,y\\}  \\{z,z\\} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  x \\\\ 0  0  y \\\\ -x  -y  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe bivector field $\\Pi$ is then:\n$$\n\\Pi = \\Pi^{12} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + \\Pi^{13} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} + \\Pi^{23} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\n$$\nSubstituting the components, we get:\n$$\n\\Pi = 0 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + x \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} + y \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} = x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} + y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\n$$\n\nThe Poisson bivector $\\Pi$ induces a bundle map $\\Pi^{\\#}: T^{*}\\mathbb{R}^{3} \\to T\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, which maps a $1$-form (covector) $\\alpha$ to a tangent vector by contraction: $\\Pi^{\\#}(\\alpha) = \\iota_{\\alpha}\\Pi$. In local coordinates, if $\\alpha = \\sum_i \\alpha_i dx^i$, the action is given by matrix multiplication:\n$$\n\\Pi^{\\#}(\\alpha) = \\sum_{i,j=1}^{3} \\Pi^{ij} \\alpha_j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}\n$$\nLet $\\alpha = \\alpha_x dx + \\alpha_y dy + \\alpha_z dz$.

Determination of the symplectic leaves**\n\nThe symplectic leaves of a Poisson manifold are the maximal integral manifolds of the characteristic distribution $\\mathcal{D}$. The distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ at a point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ is the subspace of the tangent space $T_p\\mathbb{R}^3$ given by the image of the map $\\Pi^{\\#}_p$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}_p = \\text{Im}(\\Pi^{\\#}_p) = \\{ X_f(p) \\mid f \\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^3) \\}\n$$\nwhere $X_f = \\Pi^{\\#}(df)$ is the Hamiltonian vector field of a function $f$. The distribution is spanned by the Hamiltonian vector fields of the coordinate functions. Using the expression for $\\Pi^{\\#}$:\n\nFor $f=x$, $df = dx$ (so $\\alpha_x=1, \\alpha_y=0, \\alpha_z=0$):\n$X_x = \\Pi^{\\#}(dx) = -x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$\n\nFor $f=y$, $df = dy$ (so $\\alpha_x=0, \\alpha_y=1, \\alpha_z=0$):\n$X_y = \\Pi^{\\#}(dy) = -y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$\n\nFor $f=z$, $df = dz$ (so $\\alpha_x=0, \\alpha_y=0, \\alpha_z=1$):\n$X_z = \\Pi^{\\#}(dz) = x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$\n\nAt any point $(x,y,z)$, the distribution $\\mathcal{D}_{(x,y,z)}$ is spanned by the vectors $\\{X_x(x,y,z), X_y(x,y,z), X_z(x,y,z)\\}$, which correspond to the column vectors of the matrix $\\Pi_{matrix}$ scaled by $-1, -1, 1$ respectively.\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}_{(x,y,z)} = \\text{span} \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -x \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -y \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\}\n$$\nWe analyze two cases for the structure of the leaves.\n\nCase (a): Generic points, $(x,y) \\neq (0,0)$.\nIn this region, at least one of $x$ or $y$ is non-zero. The vector $(x,y,0)$ is non-zero. The vectors $(0,0,-x)$ and $(0,0,-y)$ are linearly dependent, and their span is the $z$-direction, spanned by $(0,0,1)$ (since $(x,y) \\neq (0,0)$). The vectors $(x,y,0)$ and $(0,0,1)$ are linearly independent. Therefore, the distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ is $2$-dimensional and is spanned by the vector fields $V_1 = x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$ and $V_2 = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$.\nThe integral manifolds of this distribution form the symplectic leaves. The flow of $V_1$ corresponds to a radial scaling in the $(x,y)$-plane at constant $z$. The flow of $V_2$ corresponds to translation along the $z$-axis. Combining these flows, a leaf is generated by taking a point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ with $(x_0, y_0) \\neq (0,0)$, translating it along the $z$-axis to form the line $\\{(x_0, y_0, z) \\mid z \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$, and then scaling this line radially from the $z$-axis.\nThe resulting surface is the open half-plane containing the initial point and bounded by the $z$-axis. Explicitly, the leaf passing through $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is the set:\n$$\nL_{(x_0,y_0,z_0)} = \\left\\{ (k x_0, k y_0, z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{R}_{0}, z \\in \\mathbb{R} \\right\\}\n$$\nThese are $2$-dimensional symplectic leaves.\n\nCase (b): Points on the $z$-axis, $(x,y) = (0,0)$.\nAt any point $(0,0,z)$ on the $z$-axis, the spanning vectors of the distribution become:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}_{(0,0,z)} = \\text{span} \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\} = \\{ \\vec{0} \\}\n$$\nThe distribution is $0$-dimensional. The maximal integral manifolds are single points. Thus, each point on the $z$-axis is itself a $0$-dimensional symplectic leaf.\n\n**3. Dimension of the symplectic leaves**\n\nThe dimension of a symplectic leaf at a point $p$ is equal to the rank of the Poisson bivector matrix $\\Pi_{matrix}$ evaluated at $p$.\n\nFor a generic point $(x,y,z)$ with $(x,y) \\neq (0,0)$:\nThe matrix is $\\Pi_{matrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  x \\\\ 0  0  y \\\\ -x  -y  0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSince $(x,y) \\neq (0,0)$, at least one of $x$ or $y$ is non-zero. The determinant of the $2 \\times 2$ submatrix obtained by removing the second row and second column is $\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0  x \\\\ -x  0 \\end{pmatrix} = x^2$. Similarly, another $2 \\times 2$ minor gives $y^2$. If $x \\neq 0$ or $y \\neq 0$, at least one of these minors is non-zero, which implies the rank is at least $2$. The determinant of the $3 \\times 3$ matrix is $0$, so the rank cannot be $3$.\nTherefore, the rank is exactly $2$. The dimension of the symplectic leaf is $2$.\n\nFor points on the $z$-axis, $(x,y) = (0,0)$:\nThe matrix becomes the zero matrix: $\\Pi_{matrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe rank of the zero matrix is $0$.\nTherefore, the dimension of the symplectic leaf is $0$.\n\nThe final answer is the ordered pair of these dimensions: (leaf dimension in the generic region, leaf dimension on the $z$-axis). This pair is $(2,0)$.",

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe Poisson bracket on the two-dimensional manifold with coordinates $(x,y)$ is defined on the coordinate functions as $\\{x,y\\} = x$. For any two smooth functions $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$, the bracket is given by the general formula\n$$\n\\{f, g\\} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} \\{x,y\\} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} \\{y,x\\}\n$$\nUsing the antisymmetry property $\\{y,x\\} = -\\{x,y\\} = -x$, this becomes\n$$\n\\{f, g\\} = x \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} \\right)\n$$\nThe Hamiltonian is given as $H = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2)$. The equations of motion for the coordinates are determined by the fundamental relation $\\dot{f} = \\{f, H\\}$ for any observable $f$.\n\nFirst, we derive the equation of motion for $x$:\n$$\n\\dot{x} = \\{x, H\\} = \\{x, \\frac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2)\\}\n$$\nUsing the Leibniz rule for Poisson brackets, $\\{f, gh\\} = g\\{f,h\\} + h\\{f,g\\}$, we find:\n$$\n\\{x, y^2\\} = y\\{x,y\\} + y\\{x,y\\} = 2y\\{x,y\\} = 2yx\n$$\nAlso, $\\{x, x^2\\} = x\\{x,x\\} + x\\{x,x\\} = 0$ since $\\{x,x\\}=0$.\nThus,\n$$\n\\dot{x} = \\frac{1}{2}\\{x, x^2\\} + \\frac{1}{2}\\{x, y^2\\} = \\frac{1}{2}(0) + \\frac{1}{2}(2xy) = xy\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the equation of motion for $y$:\n$$\n\\dot{y} = \\{y, H\\} = \\{y, \\frac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2)\\}\n$$\nUsing the Leibniz rule and antisymmetry:\n$$\n\\{y, x^2\\} = x\\{y,x\\} + x\\{y,x\\} = 2x\\{y,x\\} = 2x(-x) = -2x^2\n$$\nAlso, $\\{y, y^2\\} = 0$.\nThus,\n$$\n\\dot{y} = \\frac{1}{2}\\{y, x^2\\} + \\frac{1}{2}\\{y, y^2\\} = \\frac{1}{2}(-2x^2) + \\frac{1}{2}(0) = -x^2\n$$\nThe equations of motion are therefore:\n$$\n\\dot{x} = xy\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{y} = -x^2\n$$\nThe Hamiltonian vector field is $X_H = (xy, -x^2)$.\n\nTo find the equilibria, we set the vector field to zero:\n$$\n\\dot{x} = xy = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{y} = -x^2 = 0\n$$\nFrom the second equation, we must have $x=0$. Substituting this into the first equation yields $0 \\cdot y = 0$, which is satisfied for all $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The set of equilibria is the entire $y$-axis, i.e., $\\{(0, y) | y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$.\n\nWe now analyze the stability of the equilibrium at the origin $(0,0)$. The Hamiltonian $H$ is a conserved quantity along the flow, since $\\dot{H} = \\{H,H\\} = 0$ by the antisymmetry of the Poisson bracket. The level sets of $H$ are circles centered at the origin, given by $x^2+y^2 = C$ for some constant $C \\ge 0$.\nTo analyze Lyapunov stability of the origin, we consider $H(x,y)=\\frac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2)$ as a candidate Lyapunov function.\n$1$. $H(0,0)=0$.\n$2$. $H(x,y)  0$ for all $(x,y) \\neq (0,0)$.\n$3$. $\\dot{H} = 0$, so $H$ is non-increasing along trajectories.\nThese conditions prove that the origin is Lyapunov stable. Any trajectory starting in an open ball of radius $R_0$ will remain on a level set $H=C$ where $C  \\frac{1}{2}R_0^2$, and thus will remain within that ball for all time. The origin is not, however, asymptotically stable, because a trajectory starting at $(x_0, y_0) \\neq (0,0)$ remains on the circle of radius $\\sqrt{x_0^2+y_0^2}$ and never approaches the origin.\n\nThe qualitative dynamics near the origin can be understood by examining the flow on the level sets of $H$. For any trajectory not on the $y$-axis (i.e., $x \\neq 0$), we have $\\dot{y} = -x^2  0$. This implies that the $y$-coordinate of any such trajectory is always decreasing. On a given level set (a circle), trajectories flow from the point on the positive $y$-axis, $(0,R)$, towards the point on the negative $y$-axis, $(0,-R)$, where $R = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. The points $(0, \\pm R)$ are equilibria. The point $(0,R)$ is unstable for $R  0$ (any small perturbation in $x$ leads away from it), while the point $(0,-R)$ is an attractor for all trajectories on that energy level.\n\nTo classify the fixed point at the origin $(0,0)$ via linearization, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the vector field $X_H = (F(x,y), G(x,y)) = (xy, -x^2)$:\n$$\nJ(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} y  x \\\\ -2x  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nEvaluating this matrix at the origin $(0,0)$:\n$$\nJ(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ -2(0)  0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(J(0,0) - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} -\\lambda  0 \\\\ 0  -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (-\\lambda)(-\\lambda) = \\lambda^2 = 0\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 0$ and $\\lambda_2 = 0$. Since the eigenvalues have zero real part, the fixed point at the origin is classified as non-hyperbolic or degenerate in the sense of linearization. The linearization theorem cannot be used to determine its stability, but our analysis using the conserved Hamiltonian $H$ has already established that the origin is Lyapunov stable.\n\nThe final quantity requested is the set of eigenvalues of the linearization at the origin.",
