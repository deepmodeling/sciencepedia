We begin by validating the problem statement.\n\n**Problem Validation:**\n*   **Givens:**\n    1.  The smooth map $F \\colon \\mathbb{R}^{2}_{(x,y)} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2}_{(u,v)}$ is given by the component functions $u(x,y) = x^2 - y$ and $v(x,y) = x y$.\n    2.  The one-form on the target space $\\mathbb{R}^{2}_{(u,v)}$ is $\\alpha = u\\,dv - v\\,du$.\n*   **Validation Verdict:**\n    The problem is scientifically and mathematically sound. It is a standard exercise in differential geometry involving the computation of a pullback, a fundamental operation in geometric mechanics. The provided map $F$ consists of polynomial functions, which are infinitely differentiable (smooth). The one-form $\\alpha$ is well-defined. The problem is self-contained, unambiguous, and well-posed, admitting a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe pullback of a one-form $\\alpha$ on a manifold $N$ by a smooth map $F \\colon M \\to N$ is a one-form $F^*\\alpha$ on $M$. The computation relies on two key properties of the pullback operator:\n1.  For a function (a $0$-form) $g$ on $N$, its pullback is the composition $F^*g = g \\circ F$.\n2.  The pullback commutes with the exterior derivative operator $d$, i.e., $F^*(d\\omega) = d(F^*\\omega)$ for any differential form $\\omega$.\n\nA direct consequence of these properties is that for a function $g$ on $N$, the pullback of its differential $dg$ is given by $F^*(dg) = d(F^*g) = d(g \\circ F)$.\n\nThe given one-form on the target space $\\mathbb{R}^2_{(u,v)}$ is $\\alpha = u\\,dv - v\\,du$. We compute its pullback $F^*\\alpha$ by applying the pullback operator to the entire expression:\n$$F^*\\alpha = F^*(u\\,dv - v\\,du)$$\nUsing the linearity of the pullback and its behavior with respect to multiplication by functions, we have:\n$$F^*\\alpha = F^*(u)F^*(dv) - F^*(v)F^*(du)$$\nHere, $u$ and $v$ are the coordinate functions on the target space. Their pullbacks are their compositions with the map $F$:\n$$F^*u = u \\circ F = u(x,y) = x^2 - y$$\n$$F^*v = v \\circ F = v(x,y) = xy$$\nThe pullbacks of the basis one-forms $du$ and $dv$ are computed as follows:\n$$F^*(du) = d(F^*u) = d(u \\circ F) = d(x^2 - y)$$\n$$F^*(dv) = d(F^*v) = d(v \\circ F) = d(xy)$$\nNow, we compute these exterior derivatives in the coordinate system $(x,y)$ of the source space $\\mathbb{R}^2_{(x,y)}$:\n$$d(x^2 - y) = \\frac{\\partial(x^2 - y)}{\\partial x}dx + \\frac{\\partial(x^2 - y)}{\\partial y}dy = 2x\\,dx - dy$$\n$$d(xy) = \\frac{\\partial(xy)}{\\partial x}dx + \\frac{\\partial(xy)}{\\partial y}dy = y\\,dx + x\\,dy$$\nSubstituting all these components back into the expression for $F^*\\alpha$:\n$$F^*\\alpha = (u \\circ F) d(v \\circ F) - (v \\circ F) d(u \\circ F)$$\n$$F^*\\alpha = (x^2 - y)(y\\,dx + x\\,dy) - (xy)(2x\\,dx - dy)$$\nWe now expand the terms and collect the coefficients of the basis one-forms $dx$ and $dy$:\n$$F^*\\alpha = \\left( (x^2 - y)y \\right)dx + \\left( (x^2 - y)x \\right)dy - \\left( (xy)(2x) \\right)dx - \\left( (xy)(-1) \\right)dy$$\n$$F^*\\alpha = (x^2y - y^2)dx + (x^3 - xy)dy - 2x^2y\\,dx + xy\\,dy$$\nCombining the terms for $dx$ and $dy$ separately:\nCoefficient of $dx$: $(x^2y - y^2) - 2x^2y = -x^2y - y^2$\nCoefficient of $dy$: $(x^3 - xy) + xy = x^3$\nThus, the resulting pullback one-form is:\n$$F^*\\alpha = (-x^2y - y^2)dx + x^3dy$$\nThis expression is in the required form $A(x,y)\\,dx + B(x,y)\\,dy$, with $A(x,y) = -x^2y - y^2$ and $B(x,y) = x^3$.",

This involves determining if $F$ is an immersion or embedding, analyzing its self-intersections, and evaluating the canonical symplectic form on a pair of pushforward vectors at a self-intersection point.\n\nFirst, we determine if $F$ is an immersion. A smooth map $F: M \\to N$ is an immersion if its differential, the pushforward map $\\mathrm{d}F_t: T_t M \\to T_{F(t)} N$, is injective for all $t \\in M$. For our map $F: S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$, the domain $S^1$ is a $1$-dimensional manifold, and its tangent space $T_t S^1$ is spanned by the vector $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$. The pushforward of this basis vector is found by computing the derivative of $F(t)$ with respect to the parameter $t$. Let $x(t) = \\sin(t)$ and $y(t) = \\sin(2t)$. The pushforward map $\\mathrm{d}F_t$ applied to $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ is:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}F_t\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\right) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} = \\cos(t) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + 2\\cos(2t) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} $$\nIn the standard basis of $T_{F(t)}\\mathbb{R}^2$, this vector is represented by the coordinate pair $(\\cos(t), 2\\cos(2t))$. For $\\mathrm{d}F_t$ to be injective, this pushforward vector must be non-zero for all $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. We check if it can be the zero vector $(0,0)$. This would require both components to be zero simultaneously:\n$$ \\cos(t) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2\\cos(2t) = 0 $$\nThe equation $\\cos(t) = 0$ holds for $t = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $t = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ in the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$. We check the second component at these values:\n- If $t = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, then $2\\cos(2t) = 2\\cos(\\pi) = -2 \\neq 0$.\n- If $t = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$, then $2\\cos(2t) = 2\\cos(3\\pi) = -2 \\neq 0$.\nSince the two components are never simultaneously zero, the vector $\\mathrm{d}F_t(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t})$ is never the zero vector. Therefore, $\\mathrm{d}F_t$ is injective for all $t$, and $F$ is an immersion.\n\nNext, we determine if $F$ is an embedding. An embedding is an immersion that is also a homeomorphism onto its image. For a map from a compact space like $S^1$ to a Hausdorff space like $\\mathbb{R}^2$, this is equivalent to being an injective immersion. We must check if $F$ is injective. We look for distinct points $t_1, t_2 \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ such that $F(t_1) = F(t_2)$. This gives the system of equations:\n$$ \\sin(t_1) = \\sin(t_2) $$\n$$ \\sin(2t_1) = \\sin(2t_2) $$\nFor $t_1, t_2 \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ and $t_1 \\ne t_2$, the first equation $\\sin(t_1) = \\sin(t_2)$ implies $t_1 = \\pi - t_2$. Substituting this into the second equation:\n$$ \\sin(2(\\pi - t_2)) = \\sin(2t_2) $$\n$$ \\sin(2\\pi - 2t_2) = \\sin(2t_2) $$\n$$ -\\sin(2t_2) = \\sin(2t_2) $$\nThis simplifies to $2\\sin(2t_2) = 0$, or $\\sin(2t_2) = 0$. This condition is met when $2t_2 = k\\pi$ for some integer $k$, which means $t_2 = \\frac{k\\pi}{2}$. For $t_2 \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, possible values are $t_2 \\in \\{0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi, \\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\}$.\n- If $t_2 = 0$, then $t_1 = \\pi - 0 = \\pi$. We check: $F(0) = (\\sin(0), \\sin(0)) = (0,0)$ and $F(\\pi) = (\\sin(\\pi), \\sin(2\\pi)) = (0,0)$. Since $t_1=0$ and $t_2=\\pi$ are distinct points, $F$ is not injective.\n- If $t_2 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, then $t_1 = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, so $t_1=t_2$, which is not a self-intersection.\nSince $F$ is not injective, it cannot be an embedding.\n\nThe image of the map, $F(S^1)$, has a self-intersection at the point $p = (0,0)$. The distinct preimages of this point in $S^1$ are $t_1 = 0$ and $t_2 = \\pi$.\n\nNow, we compute the pushforward vectors at this self-intersection point $p=(0,0)$ corresponding to the preimages $t_1=0$ and $t_2=\\pi$. Both resulting vectors will be in the tangent space $T_p\\mathbb{R}^2$. Let's denote them by $v_1$ and $v_2$.\nFor $t_1 = 0$:\n$$ v_1 = \\mathrm{d}F_{t_1}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\right) = \\mathrm{d}F_{0}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\right) = \\cos(0)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}|_p + 2\\cos(0)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}|_p = 1\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}|_p + 2\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}|_p $$\nFor $t_2 = \\pi$:\n$$ v_2 = \\mathrm{d}F_{t_2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\right) = \\mathrm{dF}_{\\pi}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\right) = \\cos(\\pi)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}|_p + 2\\cos(2\\pi)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}|_p = -1\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}|_p + 2\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}|_p $$\nIn coordinates, these vectors are $v_1 = (1, 2)$ and $v_2 = (-1, 2)$.\n\nFinally, we evaluate $\\omega_{p}\\big(v_1, v_2\\big)$ where $\\omega = \\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y$ is the canonical symplectic form on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The form $\\omega$ is constant over $\\mathbb{R}^2$, so $\\omega_p = (\\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y)_p$. The action of this $2$-form on a pair of tangent vectors $u = a\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + b\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$ and $v = c\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + d\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$ is given by the determinant of the matrix of their components:\n$$ (\\mathrm{d}x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y)(u,v) = \\mathrm{d}x(u)\\mathrm{d}y(v) - \\mathrm{d}x(v)\\mathrm{d}y(u) = ad - bc = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} a & c \\\\ b & d \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFor our vectors $v_1$ (with components $(1,2)$) and $v_2$ (with components $(-1,2)$), we have:\n$$ \\omega_{p}(v_1, v_2) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ 2 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (1)(2) - (-1)(2) = 2 + 2 = 4 $$\nThis value represents the oriented area of the parallelogram spanned by the two tangent vectors to the curve at its self-intersection point.",

The symplectic form on the target space is expressed in coordinates $(Q,P)$ as $\\omega = dQ \\wedge dP$.

Computation of the Hamiltonian Vector Field $X_{H}$**\nThe Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ is defined by the relation $i_{X_{H}}\\omega = dH$.\nLet's express $X_H$ in the coordinate basis as $X_{H} = A(q,p) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q} + B(q,p) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$.\nThe interior product $i_{X_{H}}\\omega$ is:\n$$\ni_{X_H}\\omega = i_{A \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q} + B \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}}(dq \\wedge dp) = A \\, i_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}}(dq \\wedge dp) + B \\, i_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}}(dq \\wedge dp)\n$$\nSince $i_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}}dq = 1$, $i_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}}dp = 0$, $i_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}}dq = 0$, and $i_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}}dp = 1$, we have:\n$$\ni_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}}(dq \\wedge dp) = (i_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}}dq) \\wedge dp - dq \\wedge (i_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}}dp) = 1 \\cdot dp - 0 = dp \\\\\ni_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}}(dq \\wedge dp) = (i_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}}dq) \\wedge dp - dq \\wedge (i_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}}dp) = 0 - dq \\wedge 1 = -dq\n$$\nSubstituting these back gives:\n$$\ni_{X_H}\\omega = A \\, dp - B \\, dq\n$$\nNext, we compute the exterior derivative of the Hamiltonian $H(q,p) = \\frac{1}{2}(q^2 + p^2) + \\lambda q p$:\n$$\ndH = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q} dq + \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} dp \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q} = q + \\lambda p \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} = p + \\lambda q\n$$\nSo, $dH = (q + \\lambda p) dq + (p + \\lambda q) dp$.\nEquating the components of $i_{X_H}\\omega$ and $dH$:\n$$\n-B \\, dq + A \\, dp = (q + \\lambda p) dq + (p + \\lambda q) dp\n$$\nThis yields $A = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} = p + \\lambda q$ and $-B = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q} = q + \\lambda p$, so $B = -(q + \\lambda p)$.\nThe Hamiltonian vector field is:\n$$\nX_H(q,p) = (p + \\lambda q) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q} - (q + \\lambda p) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\n$$\nOr as a column vector in $(q,p)$ coordinates: $X_H(q,p) = \\begin{pmatrix} p + \\lambda q \\\\ -(q + \\lambda p) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**3.

The Jacobian matrix of $F$ is constant:\n$$\ndF = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial q} & \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial p} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial q} & \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial p} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 3 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe pushforward vector at $(Q,P)$ is:\n$$\n(F_{*} X_{H})_{(Q,P)} = dF_{(q,p)} (X_H(q,p)) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 3 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} p + \\lambda q \\\\ -(q + \\lambda p) \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n= \\begin{pmatrix} 2(p + \\lambda q) - (q + \\lambda p) \\\\ 3(p + \\lambda q) - 2(q + \\lambda p) \\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix} 2p + 2\\lambda q - q - \\lambda p \\\\ 3p + 3\\lambda q - 2q - 2\\lambda p \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n= \\begin{pmatrix} (2-\\lambda)p + (2\\lambda - 1)q \\\\ (3-2\\lambda)p + (3\\lambda - 2)q \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo express this in terms of $(Q,P)$, we need the inverse map $F^{-1}$. The inverse of the Jacobian matrix is:\n$$\n(dF)^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 3 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{2(2)-1(3)} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -3 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -3 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThus, $\\begin{pmatrix} q \\\\ p \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -3 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} Q \\\\ P \\end{pmatrix}$, which gives $q = 2Q - P$ and $p = -3Q + 2P$.\nSubstituting these into the components of $F_{*} X_{H}$:\nFirst component:\n$(2-\\lambda)(-3Q+2P) + (2\\lambda-1)(2Q-P) = (-6Q+4P+3\\lambda Q-2\\lambda P) + (4\\lambda Q-2P-2Q+P) = (-8+7\\lambda)Q + (5-4\\lambda)P$.\nSecond component:\n$(3-2\\lambda)(-3Q+2P) + (3\\lambda-2)(2Q-P) = (-9Q+6P+6\\lambda Q-4\\lambda P) + (6\\lambda Q-4P-3\\lambda P+2P) = (-13+12\\lambda)Q + (8-7\\lambda)P$.\nSo, the pushforward vector field in $(Q,P)$ coordinates is:\n$$\nF_{*}X_{H}(Q,P) = \\big( (7\\lambda-8)Q + (5-4\\lambda)P \\big) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Q} + \\big( (12\\lambda-13)Q + (8-7\\lambda)P \\big) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P}\n$$\n\n**4. Computation of the Hamiltonian Vector Field $X_{H \\circ F^{-1}}$**\nLet $K(Q,P) = H \\circ F^{-1}(Q,P) = H(q(Q,P), p(Q,P))$. We substitute $q=2Q-P$ and $p=-3Q+2P$ into $H(q,p)$:\n$$\nK(Q,P) = \\frac{1}{2}\\big((2Q-P)^{2} + (-3Q+2P)^{2}\\big) + \\lambda(2Q-P)(-3Q+2P) \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{2}\\big( (4Q^2 - 4QP + P^2) + (9Q^2 - 12QP + 4P^2) \\big) + \\lambda(-6Q^2 + 7QP - 2P^2) \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{2}(13Q^2 - 16QP + 5P^2) + \\lambda(-6Q^2 + 7QP - 2P^2) \\\\\n= \\left(\\frac{13}{2} - 6\\lambda\\right)Q^2 + (-8 + 7\\lambda)QP + \\left(\\frac{5}{2} - 2\\lambda\\right)P^2\n$$\nSince $F$ is a symplectomorphism, the new coordinates $(Q,P)$ are canonical and the symplectic form is $\\omega = dQ \\wedge dP$. The Hamiltonian vector field $X_K$ in these coordinates is given by $X_K = \\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial P}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Q} - \\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial Q}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P}$.\nWe compute the partial derivatives of $K$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial P} = (-8 + 7\\lambda)Q + 2\\left(\\frac{5}{2} - 2\\lambda\\right)P = (7\\lambda-8)Q + (5-4\\lambda)P \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial Q} = 2\\left(\\frac{13}{2} - 6\\lambda\\right)Q + (-8 + 7\\lambda)P = (13-12\\lambda)Q + (7\\lambda-8)P\n$$\nThe vector field $X_{H \\circ F^{-1}} = X_K$ is therefore:\n$$\nX_{H \\circ F^{-1}}(Q,P) = \\big( (7\\lambda-8)Q + (5-4\\lambda)P \\big) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Q} - \\big( (13-12\\lambda)Q + (7\\lambda-8)P \\big) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P} \\\\\n= \\big( (7\\lambda-8)Q + (5-4\\lambda)P \\big) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Q} + \\big( (12\\lambda-13)Q + (8-7\\lambda)P \\big) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P}\n$$\n\n**5. Verification and Final Expression**\nComparing the expressions for $F_{*}X_{H}$ from step 3 and $X_{H \\circ F^{-1}}$ from step 4, we see that their components are identical.\n- First component: $(7\\lambda-8)Q + (5-4\\lambda)P$.\n- Second component: $(12\\lambda-13)Q + (8-7\\lambda)P$.\nThis verifies the fundamental property that for a symplectomorphism $F$, the pushforward of a Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ is the Hamiltonian vector field of the pulled-back Hamiltonian $H \\circ F^{-1}$: $F_{*} X_{H} = X_{H \\circ F^{-1}}$.\n\nThe final explicit expression for $X_{H \\circ F^{-1}}(Q,P)$, written as a two-component row vector, is composed of the components derived above.\nLet $X_1 = (7\\lambda-8)Q + (5-4\\lambda)P$ and $X_2 = (12\\lambda-13)Q + (8-7\\lambda)P$.\nThe vector field is $(X_1, X_2)$.",
