            "problem": "Consider the real projective line $\\mathbb{RP}^{1}$, defined as the set of one-dimensional linear subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Using homogeneous coordinates, represent points of $\\mathbb{RP}^{1}$ by equivalence classes $[x:y]$ of nonzero vectors $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$ under the relation $(x,y) \\sim (\\lambda x, \\lambda y)$ for any $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.

Your final answer must be a single closed-form expression for $\\varphi_{1} \\circ \\varphi_{0}^{-1}(u)$.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is valid as it is a well-posed question in differential geometry, resting on standard, correct definitions and requiring a formal derivation.\n\nTo demonstrate that the two charts, $(U_{0}, \\varphi_{0})$ and $(U_{1}, \\varphi_{1})$, form a smoothly compatible atlas for the real projective line $\\mathbb{RP}^{1}$, we must first confirm they constitute an atlas and then verify that their transition function is smooth ($C^{\\infty}$).\n\nAn atlas on a topological space $M$ is a collection of charts $\\{(U_{\\alpha}, \\varphi_{\\alpha})\\}$ such that the sets $U_{\\alpha}$ form an open cover of $M$, and each $\\varphi_{\\alpha}$ is a homeomorphism from $U_{\\alpha}$ to an open subset of a Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. For the atlas to be smooth, all transition functions $\\varphi_{\\beta} \\circ \\varphi_{\\alpha}^{-1}$, defined on the open set $\\varphi_{\\alpha}(U_{\\alpha} \\cap U_{\\beta})$, must be smooth maps.\n\nFirst, we verify that $\\{U_{0}, U_{1}\\}$ is an open cover of $\\mathbb{RP}^{1}$. A point in $\\mathbb{RP}^{1}$ is an equivalence class $[x:y]$ where $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$. This means that at least one of $x$ or $y$ must be non-zero.\n- If $x \\neq 0$, the point $[x:y]$ belongs to $U_{0} = \\{[x:y] \\in \\mathbb{RP}^{1} \\mid x \\neq 0\\}$.\n- If $x = 0$, then it must be that $y \\neq 0$ (since $(x,y) \\neq (0,0)$), so the point $[x:y]$ belongs to $U_{1} = \\{[x:y] \\in \\mathbb{RP}^{1} \\mid y \\neq 0\\}$.\nSince every point in $\\mathbb{RP}^{1}$ must belong to at least one of these sets, we have $U_{0} \\cup U_{1} = \\mathbb{RP}^{1}$. The sets $U_{0}$ and $U_{1}$ are open in the quotient topology of $\\mathbb{RP}^{1}$, as they are the images of the open sets $\\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\} \\mid x \\neq 0\\}$ and $\\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\} \\mid y \\neq 0\\}$, respectively, under the quotient map $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\} \\to \\mathbb{RP}^{1}$. The maps $\\varphi_{0}$ and $\\varphi_{1}$ are homeomorphisms from their domains to $\\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $\\{(U_{0}, \\varphi_{0}), (U_{1}, \\varphi_{1})\\}$ constitutes an atlas for $\\mathbb{RP}^{1}$.\n\nNext, we establish smooth compatibility by computing the transition function $\\varphi_{1} \\circ \\varphi_{0}^{-1}$. This function maps the coordinate representation of a point from the chart $(U_{0}, \\varphi_{0})$ to its coordinate representation in the chart $(U_{1}, \\varphi_{1})$.\n\nThe domain of the transition function is the image of the overlap of the chart domains, $U_{0} \\cap U_{1}$, under the first chart map, $\\varphi_{0}$.\nThe overlap is $U_{0} \\cap U_{1} = \\{[x:y] \\in \\mathbb{RP}^{1} \\mid x \\neq 0 \\text{ and } y \\neq 0\\}$.\n\nThe image of this overlap under $\\varphi_{0}$ is:\n$$ \\varphi_{0}(U_{0} \\cap U_{1}) = \\{ \\varphi_{0}([x:y]) \\mid x \\neq 0, y \\neq 0 \\} = \\{ y/x \\mid x \\neq 0, y \\neq 0 \\} $$\nSince $y \\neq 0$, the ratio $y/x$ can be any real number except $0$. Thus, the domain of the transition function is $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, which is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe range of the transition function is the image of the overlap under $\\varphi_{1}$:\n$$ \\varphi_{1}(U_{0} \\cap U_{1}) = \\{ \\varphi_{1}([x:y]) \\mid x \\neq 0, y \\neq 0 \\} = \\{ x/y \\mid x \\neq 0, y \\neq 0 \\} $$\nThis is also $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, another open subset of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNow, we derive the explicit form of the transition function $\\varphi_{1} \\circ \\varphi_{0}^{-1}: \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. Let $u$ be a coordinate in the chart $(U_{0}, \\varphi_{0})$, so $u \\in \\varphi_{0}(U_{0} \\cap U_{1}) = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n\nBy definition, $u = \\varphi_{0}([x:y]) = y/x$ for some point $[x:y] \\in U_{0} \\cap U_{1}$.\nTo compute $(\\varphi_{1} \\circ \\varphi_{0}^{-1})(u)$, we must first find the point in $\\mathbb{RP}^{1}$ that corresponds to the coordinate $u$. This is given by the inverse map $\\varphi_{0}^{-1}$. We need to find $[x:y]$ such that $\\varphi_{0}([x:y]) = u$.\nFrom $u = y/x$, we can represent the equivalence class $[x:y]$ in many ways. A convenient choice is to set $x=1$. Since $[x:y] \\in U_{0}$, $x$ is non-zero, so this is a valid scaling. If $x=1$, then $u = y/1$, which implies $y=u$.\nSo, a representative for the point in $\\mathbb{RP}^{1}$ is $[1:u]$.\nTherefore, $\\varphi_{0}^{-1}(u) = [1:u]$.\nNote that for this point to be in the overlap $U_{0} \\cap U_{1}$, we must have both coordinates non-zero. The first coordinate is $1 \\neq 0$, so $[1:u] \\in U_{0}$ is guaranteed. The second coordinate is $u$. For the point to be in $U_{1}$, we require $u \\neq 0$. This is consistent with the domain of our transition map, $u \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n\nNext, we apply the map $\\varphi_{1}$ to this point:\n$$ \\varphi_{1}(\\varphi_{0}^{-1}(u)) = \\varphi_{1}([1:u]) $$\nThe map $\\varphi_{1}$ is defined as $\\varphi_{1}([x:y]) = x/y$. Applying this to the point $[1:u]$:\n$$ \\varphi_{1}([1:u]) = \\frac{1}{u} $$\nThus, the transition function is given by the expression:\n$$ (\\varphi_{1} \\circ \\varphi_{0}^{-1})(u) = \\frac{1}{u} $$\nThis function, $f(u) = 1/u$, is defined on the open set $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. It is infinitely differentiable ($C^{\\infty}$) for all $u \\neq 0$. For any integer $n \\ge 1$, its $n$-th derivative is $f^{(n)}(u) = (-1)^{n} n! u^{-(n+1)}$, which is well-defined on $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\nSimilarly, the inverse transition function $\\varphi_{0} \\circ \\varphi_{1}^{-1}$ is given by $(\\varphi_{0} \\circ \\varphi_{1}^{-1})(v) = 1/v$ for $v \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, which is also $C^{\\infty}$.\nSince the transition function is smooth, the charts $(U_{0}, \\varphi_{0})$ and $(U_{1}, \\varphi_{1})$ are smoothly compatible, and they define a smooth $1$-dimensional manifold structure on $\\mathbb{RP}^{1}$.\n\nThe question asks for the explicit analytic expression for the transition function $\\varphi_{1} \\circ \\varphi_{0}^{-1}(u)$. Based on the derivation above, this expression is $1/u$.",

The problem is well-posed, scientifically sound, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nLet the smooth manifold be $Q=\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with global coordinates $(x^{1}, \\dots, x^{n})$. The basis for the tangent space at any point is given by the set of partial derivative operators $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{1}}, \\dots, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{n}}\\}$.\nThe vector fields $X$ and $Y$ are given in coordinates as:\n$$X = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X^{i}(x) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}$$\n$$Y = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} Y^{j}(x) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}}$$\nwhere the component functions $X^{i}, Y^{j} \\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$ for all $i,j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThe Lie bracket $[X,Y]$ is defined by its action as a derivation on any smooth function $f \\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$:\n$$[X,Y](f) = X(Y(f)) - Y(X(f))$$\n\nThe Lie bracket $[X,Y]$ of two vector fields is itself a vector field. Let us denote its coordinate expression as:\n$$[X,Y] = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} Z^{k}(x) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{k}}$$\nOur first goal is to determine the component functions $Z^{k}(x)$. The components of a vector field $Z$ can be found by evaluating its action on the coordinate functions $x^{k}$, since $Z(x^{k}) = (\\sum_{j=1}^{n} Z^{j} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}})(x^{k}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} Z^{j} \\frac{\\partial x^{k}}{\\partial x^{j}} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} Z^{j} \\delta_{j}^{k} = Z^{k}$.\nTherefore, the $k$-th component of $[X,Y]$ is given by $([X,Y])^{k} = [X,Y](x^{k})$.\n\nWe compute this using the definition of the Lie bracket:\n$$([X,Y])^{k} = [X,Y](x^{k}) = X(Y(x^{k})) - Y(X(x^{k}))$$\n\nFirst, we compute the inner terms.

We denote these tangent vectors as $\\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\theta}$ and $\\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\varphi}$.\n\nWe compute these partial derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\theta} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial\\theta}, \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial\\theta}, \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial\\theta} \\right) = (\\cos\\theta\\cos\\varphi, \\cos\\theta\\sin\\varphi, -\\sin\\theta) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\varphi} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial\\varphi}, \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial\\varphi}, \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial\\varphi} \\right) = (-\\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi, \\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi, 0) $$\n\nThe components of the metric tensor $g$ in the $(\\theta, \\varphi)$ coordinate system, denoted $g_{ij}$, are the Euclidean inner products of these tangent basis vectors.\nThe component $g_{\\theta\\theta}$ is the inner product of $\\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\theta}$ with itself:\n$$ g_{\\theta\\theta} = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\theta}, \\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\theta} \\right\\rangle = (\\cos\\theta\\cos\\varphi)^2 + (\\cos\\theta\\sin\\varphi)^2 + (-\\sin\\theta)^2 $$\n$$ g_{\\theta\\theta} = \\cos^2\\theta(\\cos^2\\varphi + \\sin^2\\varphi) + \\sin^2\\theta = \\cos^2\\theta(1) + \\sin^2\\theta = 1 $$\n\nThe off-diagonal component $g_{\\theta\\varphi}$ is the inner product of $\\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\theta}$ and $\\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\varphi}$:\n$$ g_{\\theta\\varphi} = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\theta}, \\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\varphi} \\right\\rangle = (\\cos\\theta\\cos\\varphi)(-\\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi) + (\\cos\\theta\\sin\\varphi)(\\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi) + (-\\sin\\theta)(0) $$\n$$ g_{\\theta\\varphi} = -\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta\\cos\\varphi\\sin\\varphi + \\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta\\sin\\varphi\\cos\\varphi = 0 $$\nBy symmetry, $g_{\\varphi\\theta} = g_{\\theta\\varphi} = 0$.\n\nThe component $g_{\\varphi\\varphi}$ is the inner product of $\\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\varphi}$ with itself:\n$$ g_{\\varphi\\varphi} = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\varphi}, \\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\varphi} \\right\\rangle = (-\\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi)^2 + (\\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi)^2 + 0^2 $$\n$$ g_{\\varphi\\varphi} = \\sin^2\\theta(\\sin^2\\varphi + \\cos^2\\varphi) = \\sin^2\\theta(1) = \\sin^2\\theta $$\n\nThus, the metric tensor $g$ in the coordinates $(\\theta,\\varphi)$ has the component matrix:\n$$ (g_{ij}) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sin^2\\theta \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe Riemannian line element is $ds^2 = g_{\\theta\\theta}d\\theta^2 + 2g_{\\theta\\varphi}d\\theta d\\varphi + g_{\\varphi\\varphi}d\\varphi^2 = d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta d\\varphi^2$.\n\nStep 2: Construct the Riemannian area $2$-form $\\omega$.\n\nAccording to the provided definition, in a positively oriented local coordinate chart $(x^1, x^2)$, the area $2$-form is $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} \\, dx^1 \\wedge dx^2$. For our coordinates $(\\theta, \\varphi)$, this becomes $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} \\, d\\theta \\wedge d\\varphi$.\n\nFirst, we compute the determinant of the metric tensor matrix:\n$$ \\det(g_{ij}) = (1)(\\sin^2\\theta) - (0)(0) = \\sin^2\\theta $$\nThe square root is $\\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} = \\sqrt{\\sin^2\\theta} = |\\sin\\theta|$.\nThe coordinate $\\theta$ is restricted to the domain $(0, \\pi)$, where $\\sin\\theta > 0$. Therefore, $|\\sin\\theta| = \\sin\\theta$.\n\nWe must verify that the orientation of the coordinate chart $(\\theta, \\varphi)$ matches the specified outward orientation of $S^2$. The orientation induced by the chart is given by the direction of the normal vector $\\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\theta} \\times \\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\varphi}$.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\theta} \\times \\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\varphi} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\ \\cos\\theta\\cos\\varphi & \\cos\\theta\\sin\\varphi & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ -\\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi & \\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi & 0 \\end{vmatrix} $$\n$$ = \\mathbf{i}(0 - (-\\sin\\theta)(\\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi)) - \\mathbf{j}(0 - (-\\sin\\theta)(-\\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi)) + \\mathbf{k}(\\cos\\theta\\cos\\varphi\\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi - \\cos\\theta\\sin\\varphi(-\\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi)) $$\n$$ = (\\sin^2\\theta\\cos\\varphi)\\mathbf{i} + (\\sin^2\\theta\\sin\\varphi)\\mathbf{j} + (\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta(\\cos^2\\varphi + \\sin^2\\varphi))\\mathbf{k} $$\n$$ = (\\sin^2\\theta\\cos\\varphi, \\sin^2\\theta\\sin\\varphi, \\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta) $$\nWe can factor out $\\sin\\theta$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\theta} \\times \\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\varphi} = \\sin\\theta(\\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi, \\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi, \\cos\\theta) = \\sin\\theta \\, \\Phi(\\theta,\\varphi) $$\nThe vector $\\Phi(\\theta, \\varphi)$ is the position vector of a point on the unit sphere, which is identical to the outward-pointing unit normal vector at that point. Since $\\sin\\theta > 0$ for $\\theta \\in (0, \\pi)$, the vector $\\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\theta} \\times \\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\varphi}$ points in the same direction as the outward normal. Thus, the coordinate chart $(\\theta, \\varphi)$ is positively oriented with respect to the given orientation of $S^2$.\n\nThis confirms our choice of the positive square root. The Riemannian area $2$-form in these coordinates is:\n$$ \\omega = \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\wedge d\\varphi $$\n\nStep 3: Compute the integral $\\int_{S^2} \\omega$.\n\nThe integral of the $2$-form $\\omega$ over the manifold $S^2$ can be computed by performing a double integral of its coordinate representation over the domain of the chart. The coordinate chart $\\Phi$ covers $S^2$ except for a meridian and the poles, which is a set of measure zero.\n$$ \\int_{S^2} \\omega = \\iint_{(0,\\pi)\\times(0,2\\pi)} \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\, d\\varphi $$\nWe evaluate this as an iterated integral:\n$$ \\int_{S^2} \\omega = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left( \\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\right) d\\varphi $$\nFirst, we compute the inner integral with respect to $\\theta$:\n$$ \\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta = [-\\cos\\theta]_0^{\\pi} = (-\\cos(\\pi)) - (-\\cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2 $$\nNow we substitute this result into the outer integral:\n$$ \\int_{S^2} \\omega = \\int_0^{2\\pi} 2 \\, d\\varphi = 2 [\\varphi]_0^{2\\pi} = 2 (2\\pi - 0) = 4\\pi $$\nThe area of the unit $2$-sphere is $4\\pi$.",
