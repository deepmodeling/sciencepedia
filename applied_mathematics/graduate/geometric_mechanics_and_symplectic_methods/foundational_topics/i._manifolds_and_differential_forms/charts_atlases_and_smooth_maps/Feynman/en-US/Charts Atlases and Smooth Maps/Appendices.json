            "problem": "Let $M$ be the real line $\\mathbb{R}$ with its standard topology. Consider the following two charts on $M$: $(U_{1},\\varphi_{1})$ with $U_{1}=\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\varphi_{1}(x)=x$, and $(U_{2},\\varphi_{2})$ with $U_{2}=\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\varphi_{2}(x)=x|x|$. Use the fundamental definitions of chart, atlas, smooth structure, and smooth transition maps to analyze whether the atlas $\\mathcal{A}=\\{(U_{1},\\varphi_{1}),(U_{2},\\varphi_{2})\\}$ defines a smooth (i.e., $C^{\\infty}$) structure on $M$.

Your final answer must be the exact value of $\\Delta$ as a single real number. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem asks us to determine whether the atlas $\\mathcal{A}=\\{(U_{1},\\varphi_{1}),(U_{2},\\varphi_{2})\\}$ on the manifold $M=\\mathbb{R}$ defines a smooth ($C^{\\infty}$) structure. A topological manifold is endowed with a smooth structure by a maximal smooth atlas. An atlas is smooth if for any two charts in the atlas, the transition map between them is a $C^{\\infty}$ diffeomorphism. We must therefore examine the transition maps for the given atlas.\n\nThe two charts are given by:\n1.  $(U_{1},\\varphi_{1})$ with $U_{1}=\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\varphi_{1}(x)=x$.\n2.  $(U_{2},\\varphi_{2})$ with $U_{2}=\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\varphi_{2}(x)=x|x|$.\n\nThe overlap region between the domains of the charts is $U_{1} \\cap U_{2} = \\mathbb{R} \\cap \\mathbb{R} = \\mathbb{R}$. The transition maps are defined on the images of this overlap under the chart maps.\n\nLet's compute the first transition map, $f_{21} = \\varphi_{2} \\circ \\varphi_{1}^{-1}$. This map takes coordinates from the first chart to coordinates in the second chart.\nThe domain of $f_{21}$ is $\\varphi_{1}(U_{1} \\cap U_{2}) = \\varphi_{1}(\\mathbb{R}) = \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe codomain is $\\varphi_{2}(U_{1} \\cap U_{2}) = \\varphi_{2}(\\mathbb{R}) = \\mathbb{R}$.\nFirst, we find the inverse of $\\varphi_{1}$. If $y = \\varphi_{1}(x) = x$, then $x = y$. So, $\\varphi_{1}^{-1}(y) = y$.\nThe transition map is then $f_{21}(y) = \\varphi_{2}(\\varphi_{1}^{-1}(y)) = \\varphi_{2}(y) = y|y|$. Let us denote this map by $f(y) = y|y|$ as per the problem statement.\n\nFor the atlas to be smooth, this transition map $f(y)$ must be a $C^{\\infty}$ function. Let's analyze its differentiability. We can write $f(y)$ in a piecewise form:\n$$\nf(y) = \\begin{cases}\ny^{2} & \\text{if } y \\ge 0 \\\\\n-y^{2} & \\text{if } y < 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe function is clearly $C^{\\infty}$ for all $y \\neq 0$. The potential point of failure is at $y=0$.\n\nLet's compute the first derivative, $f'(y)$.\nFor $y > 0$, $f'(y) = \\frac{d}{dy}(y^{2}) = 2y$.\nFor $y  0$, $f'(y) = \\frac{d}{dy}(-y^{2}) = -2y$.\nTo check differentiability at $y=0$, we examine the limit definition of the derivative:\nThe right-hand derivative is $\\lim_{h \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{f(h)-f(0)}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{h^{2}-0}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^{+}} h = 0$.\nThe left-hand derivative is $\\lim_{h \\to 0^{-}} \\frac{f(h)-f(0)}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^{-}} \\frac{-h^{2}-0}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^{-}} (-h) = 0$.\nSince the left and right derivatives match, $f'(0)$ exists and is equal to $0$.\nSo, the first derivative is:\n$$\nf'(y) = \\begin{cases}\n2y  \\text{if } y \\ge 0 \\\\\n-2y  \\text{if } y  0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis is equivalent to $f'(y) = 2|y|$. This function is continuous everywhere, including at $y=0$, since $\\lim_{y \\to 0} 2|y| = 0 = f'(0)$. Thus, the transition map $f(y)$ is of differentiability class $C^{1}$.\n\nNow, let's compute the second derivative, $f''(y)$.\nFor $y > 0$, $f''(y) = \\frac{d}{dy}(2y) = 2$.\nFor $y  0$, $f''(y) = \\frac{d}{dy}(-2y) = -2$.\nTo check if $f$ is $C^{2}$ at $y=0$, we must check if $f'$ is differentiable at $y=0$.\nThe right-hand derivative of $f'$ at $y=0$ is $\\lim_{h \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{f'(h)-f'(0)}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{2h-0}{h} = 2$.\nThe left-hand derivative of $f'$ at $y=0$ is $\\lim_{h \\to 0^{-}} \\frac{f'(h)-f'(0)}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^{-}} \\frac{-2h-0}{h} = -2$.\nSince the right-hand derivative ($2$) and the left-hand derivative ($-2$) do not match, the second derivative $f''(0)$ does not exist.\nTherefore, the transition map $f(y) = y|y|$ is not a $C^{2}$ function, and consequently, it is not a $C^{\\infty}$ function. An atlas requires all its transition maps to be $C^{\\infty}$ to define a smooth structure. Since we have found a transition map that is not $C^{\\infty}$, the atlas $\\mathcal{A}$ is not a smooth atlas and does not define a smooth structure on $M=\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe problem also directs us to consider the implications for geometric mechanics. The framework of geometric mechanics relies on the manifold $M$ (the configuration space) being smooth. The phase space is the cotangent bundle $T^{*}M$, which inherits its smooth structure from $M$. Local coordinates on $M$, say $q$, induce canonical coordinates $(q,p)$ on $T^{*}M$. A change of coordinates on $M$, from $q$ to $\\tilde{q}(q)$, induces a transformation on $T^{*}M$ given by $\\tilde{q} = \\tilde{q}(q)$ and $\\tilde{p} = (\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{q}}{\\partial q})^{-1} p$. For this induced transformation on $T^{*}M$ to be smooth, the original transformation on $M$ must be smooth ($C^{\\infty}$). In our case, the transition map $\\tilde{q} = f(q) = q|q|$ is only $C^{1}$. The transformation for the momentum coordinate $\\tilde{p}$ involves the derivative of $f(q)^{-1}$, which fails to be $C^{1}$. This means the induced atlas on $T^{*}M$ is only $C^{0}$ (continuous), which is insufficient to define a smooth manifold structure. Furthermore, many fundamental objects in mechanics, such as connection coefficients (related to inertial forces) or the transformation of the Poisson bracket, depend on second derivatives of the coordinate transformations. The non-existence of $f''(0)$ implies these objects would be undefined at the point corresponding to $x=0$, rendering the physical theory ill-posed.\n\nFinally, we compute the jump $\\Delta$ in the second derivative of the transition map $f(y) = y|y|$ at $y=0$. The jump is defined as $\\Delta = \\lim_{h\\to 0^{+}} f''(h)-\\lim_{h\\to 0^{-}} f''(h)$.\nFrom our analysis above, we have the expressions for the second derivative for $h \\neq 0$:\n$$\nf''(h) = \\begin{cases}\n2  \\text{if } h  0 \\\\\n-2  \\text{if } h  0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nNow we compute the required one-sided limits:\nThe limit from the right is $\\lim_{h\\to 0^{+}} f''(h) = \\lim_{h\\to 0^{+}} 2 = 2$.\nThe limit from the left is $\\lim_{h\\to 0^{-}} f''(h) = \\lim_{h\\to 0^{-}} (-2) = -2$.\nTherefore, the jump $\\Delta$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta = (2) - (-2) = 2 + 2 = 4.\n$$\nThis non-zero jump provides a precise measure of the failure of the transition map to be $C^2$ at the origin.",

            "problem": "Consider the unit two-sphere $S^{2} = \\{(X,Y,Z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3} : X^{2} + Y^{2} + Z^{2} = 1\\}$. In geometric mechanics, $S^{2}$ appears as a coadjoint orbit endowed with a symplectic form, and one often uses local charts to analyze smooth structures and coordinate-based constructions. Define two charts on $S^{2}$ by stereographic projection onto the equatorial plane $Z=0$: let $\\phi_{N} : S^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0,1)\\} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ be the stereographic projection from the north pole $(0,0,1)$, and let $\\phi_{S} : S^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0,-1)\\} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ be the stereographic projection from the south pole $(0,0,-1)$. These charts are obtained by sending each point of $S^{2}$ (excluding the respective pole) along the straight line through the corresponding pole to the plane $Z=0$ and reading off its $(X,Y)$-coordinates.\n\nUsing only the definitions of a chart, stereographic projection, and the unit sphere, derive the explicit coordinate expression for the transition map $\\Phi = \\phi_{S} \\circ \\phi_{N}^{-1}$ on the overlap $S^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0,1),(0,0,-1)\\}$, expressed in terms of the coordinates $(u,v) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$ of the chart $\\phi_{N}$.

No rounding is required, and no units are involved.",
            "solution": "We begin by establishing the explicit formulas for the stereographic projection charts $\\phi_{N}$ and $\\phi_{S}$, and the inverse map $\\phi_{N}^{-1}$. Let a point on the unit sphere $S^2$ be denoted by $P=(X,Y,Z)$, where $X^{2} + Y^{2} + Z^{2} = 1$. The coordinates in the chart $\\phi_{N}$ are $(u,v)$.\n\nFirst, we derive the map $\\phi_{N}: S^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0,1)\\} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The north pole is $N = (0,0,1)$. A line passing through $N$ and another point $P=(X,Y,Z)$ on the sphere is parameterized by $L(t) = N + t(P - N) = (0,0,1) + t(X, Y, Z-1)$ for $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The projection of $P$ onto the plane $Z=0$ is the intersection of this line with the plane. At the intersection point, the $Z$-coordinate is $0$.\n$1 + t(Z-1) = 0 \\implies t = \\frac{1}{1-Z}$.\nThis value of $t$ is well-defined because $Z \\neq 1$ for any point in the domain of $\\phi_{N}$. The coordinates of the intersection point in the $Z=0$ plane are $(u,v)$, which correspond to the $X$ and $Y$ coordinates of the line at this value of $t$.\n$u = 0 + tX = \\frac{X}{1-Z}$\n$v = 0 + tY = \\frac{Y}{1-Z}$\nThus, the chart map $\\phi_{N}$ is given by $\\phi_{N}(X,Y,Z) = \\left( \\frac{X}{1-Z}, \\frac{Y}{1-Z} \\right)$.\n\nNext, we derive the inverse map $\\phi_{N}^{-1}: \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\to S^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0,1)\\}$. Given a point $(u,v)$ in the plane, we need to find the corresponding point $(X,Y,Z)$ on the sphere. From the expressions for $u$ and $v$, we have $X=u(1-Z)$ and $Y=v(1-Z)$. We substitute these into the sphere equation $X^{2} + Y^{2} + Z^{2} = 1$:\n$(u(1-Z))^{2} + (v(1-Z))^{2} + Z^{2} = 1$\n$(u^{2}+v^{2})(1-Z)^{2} + Z^{2} = 1$\n$(u^{2}+v^{2})(1 - 2Z + Z^{2}) + Z^{2} = 1$\n$(u^{2}+v^{2}) - 2Z(u^{2}+v^{2}) + Z^{2}(u^{2}+v^{2}) + Z^{2} = 1$\n$Z^{2}(u^{2}+v^{2}+1) - 2Z(u^{2}+v^{2}) + (u^{2}+v^{2}-1) = 0$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $Z$. We observe that $Z=1$ is a solution:\n$(u^{2}+v^{2}+1) - 2(u^{2}+v^{2}) + (u^{2}+v^{2}-1) = (u^{2}+v^{2}) + 1 - 2(u^{2}+v^{2}) + (u^{2}+v^{2}) - 1 = 0$.\nThe point corresponding to $Z=1$ is the north pole, which is not in the image of $\\phi_{N}^{-1}$. Factoring out $(Z-1)$ from the quadratic yields $(Z-1)[Z(u^{2}+v^{2}+1) - (u^{2}+v^{2}-1)] = 0$. The other solution is:\n$Z = \\frac{u^{2}+v^{2}-1}{u^{2}+v^{2}+1}$.\nThis gives the $Z$-coordinate of the point on the sphere. Now we find $X$ and $Y$:\n$1-Z = 1 - \\frac{u^{2}+v^{2}-1}{u^{2}+v^{2}+1} = \\frac{(u^{2}+v^{2}+1) - (u^{2}+v^{2}-1)}{u^{2}+v^{2}+1} = \\frac{2}{u^{2}+v^{2}+1}$.\n$X = u(1-Z) = \\frac{2u}{u^{2}+v^{2}+1}$.\n$Y = v(1-Z) = \\frac{2v}{u^{2}+v^{2}+1}$.\nTherefore, the inverse map is $\\phi_{N}^{-1}(u,v) = \\left( \\frac{2u}{u^{2}+v^{2}+1}, \\frac{2v}{u^{2}+v^{2}+1}, \\frac{u^{2}+v^{2}-1}{u^{2}+v^{2}+1} \\right)$.\n\nNow, we derive the map $\\phi_{S}: S^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0,-1)\\} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The south pole is $S=(0,0,-1)$. The derivation is analogous to that of $\\phi_{N}$. The line through $S$ and $P=(X,Y,Z)$ is $L(t) = S + t(P-S) = (0,0,-1) + t(X, Y, Z+1)$. Setting the $Z$-coordinate to $0$:\n$-1 + t(Z+1) = 0 \\implies t = \\frac{1}{1+Z}$.\nThe coordinates in the plane are:\n$u' = \\frac{X}{1+Z}$\n$v' = \\frac{Y}{1+Z}$\nSo, $\\phi_{S}(X,Y,Z) = \\left( \\frac{X}{1+Z}, \\frac{Y}{1+Z} \\right)$.\n\nWe are now ready to compute the transition map $\\Phi = \\phi_{S} \\circ \\phi_{N}^{-1}$. This map is defined for $(u,v)$ such that $\\phi_{N}^{-1}(u,v)$ is in the domain of $\\phi_{S}$, i.e., $\\phi_{N}^{-1}(u,v) \\neq (0,0,-1)$. We find which $(u,v)$ maps to the south pole:\n$\\phi_{N}^{-1}(u,v) = (0,0,-1) \\implies \\frac{2u}{u^{2}+v^{2}+1} = 0, \\frac{2v}{u^{2}+v^{2}+1} = 0, \\frac{u^{2}+v^{2}-1}{u^{2}+v^{2}+1} = -1$.\nThe first two equations imply $u=0$ and $v=0$. Substituting into the third: $\\frac{0-1}{0+1} = -1$, which is true. Thus, $\\phi_{N}^{-1}(0,0) = (0,0,-1)$. The domain of $\\Phi$ is therefore $\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$, as stated in the problem.\n\nLet $(u', v') = \\Phi(u,v) = \\phi_{S}(\\phi_{N}^{-1}(u,v))$. We substitute the expressions for $(X,Y,Z) = \\phi_{N}^{-1}(u,v)$ into the formula for $\\phi_{S}$.\nThe components of $\\phi_{N}^{-1}(u,v)$ are:\n$X = \\frac{2u}{u^{2}+v^{2}+1}$\n$Y = \\frac{2v}{u^{2}+v^{2}+1}$\n$Z = \\frac{u^{2}+v^{2}-1}{u^{2}+v^{2}+1}$\nWe need the term $1+Z$:\n$1+Z = 1 + \\frac{u^{2}+v^{2}-1}{u^{2}+v^{2}+1} = \\frac{(u^{2}+v^{2}+1) + (u^{2}+v^{2}-1)}{u^{2}+v^{2}+1} = \\frac{2(u^{2}+v^{2})}{u^{2}+v^{2}+1}$.\nNow we find $(u', v')$:\n$u' = \\frac{X}{1+Z} = \\frac{\\frac{2u}{u^{2}+v^{2}+1}}{\\frac{2(u^{2}+v^{2})}{u^{2}+v^{2}+1}} = \\frac{2u}{2(u^{2}+v^{2})} = \\frac{u}{u^{2}+v^{2}}$.\n$v' = \\frac{Y}{1+Z} = \\frac{\\frac{2v}{u^{2}+v^{2}+1}}{\\frac{2(u^{2}+v^{2})}{u^{2}+v^{2}+1}} = \\frac{2v}{2(u^{2}+v^{2})} = \\frac{v}{u^{2}+v^{2}}$.\nSo, the explicit expression for the transition map is $\\Phi(u,v) = \\left( \\frac{u}{u^{2}+v^{2}}, \\frac{v}{u^{2}+v^{2}} \\right)$.\n\nFinally, we verify that this map is smooth on its domain, $\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$. The component functions of $\\Phi(u,v)$ are $u'(u,v) = \\frac{u}{u^{2}+v^{2}}$ and $v'(u,v) = \\frac{v}{u^{2}+v^{2}}$. Both are rational functions of the variables $u$ and $v$. A rational function is infinitely differentiable (smooth, or $C^{\\infty}$) at all points where its denominator is non-zero. The denominator for both components is $u^{2}+v^{2}$. This expression is zero only if $u=0$ and $v=0$ simultaneously, i.e., at the point $(0,0)$. Since the domain of $\\Phi$ is precisely $\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$, the denominator is never zero on the domain of definition. Therefore, the component functions $u'(u,v)$ and $v'(u,v)$ are smooth on their domain, and consequently, the transition map $\\Phi$ is smooth.\nThis completes the derivation and verification.",

This result shows that the component of $\\theta$ corresponding to the basis $1$-form $dq^{i}$ is the coordinate function $p_{i}$.\n\nNext, consider the tangent vectors $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{j}}|_{\\alpha}$. This vector represents the velocity of a curve on $T^{*}U$ along which only the fiber coordinate $p_{j}$ changes, while the base coordinates $q^{i}$ are held constant. The projection of such a curve onto $U$ is a single point, $\\pi(\\alpha)$. Therefore, the tangent vector to the projected curve is the zero vector: $\\pi_{*}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{j}}|_{\\alpha}) = 0 \\in T_{\\pi(\\alpha)}U$.\n\nThe action of $\\theta_{\\alpha}$ on this vector is:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\alpha}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{j}}\\right) = \\alpha\\left(\\pi_{*}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{j}}\\right)\\right) = \\alpha(0) = 0\n$$\nThis shows that the components of $\\theta$ corresponding to the basis $1$-forms $dp_{j}$ are all zero.\n\nCombining these results, the local expression for the tautological $1$-form $\\theta$ on $T^{*}U$ is:\n$$\n\\theta = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} \\, dq^{i} + \\sum_{j=1}^{n} 0 \\cdot dp_{j} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} \\, dq^{i}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the canonical symplectic $2$-form $\\omega = -d\\theta$ by taking the exterior derivative of the local expression for $\\theta$. Using the properties of the exterior derivative, specifically the Leibniz rule for forms $d(f\\eta) = df \\wedge \\eta + f d\\eta$ and the property $d^{2}f = 0$ for any function $f$:\n$$\n\\omega = -d\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} \\, dq^{i}\\right) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{n} d(p_{i} \\, dq^{i}) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(dp_{i} \\wedge dq^{i} + p_{i} \\, d(dq^{i})\\right)\n$$\nSince $q^{i}$ are coordinate functions, the $1$-forms $dq^{i}$ are exact, i.e., $dq^{i} = d(q^{i})$. Therefore, $d(dq^{i}) = d(d(q^{i})) = 0$. The expression for $\\omega$ simplifies to:\n$$\n\\omega = -\\sum_{i=1}^{n} dp_{i} \\wedge dq^{i}\n$$\nUsing the anticommutative property of the wedge product, $dp_{i} \\wedge dq^{i} = -dq^{i} \\wedge dp_{i}$, we obtain the final standard form:\n$$\n\\omega = -\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (-dq^{i} \\wedge dp_{i}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} dq^{i} \\wedge dp_{i}\n$$\nThis is the expression for the canonical symplectic form in the local Darboux coordinates $(q^{1}, \\dots, q^{n}, p_{1}, \\dots, p_{n})$.",
