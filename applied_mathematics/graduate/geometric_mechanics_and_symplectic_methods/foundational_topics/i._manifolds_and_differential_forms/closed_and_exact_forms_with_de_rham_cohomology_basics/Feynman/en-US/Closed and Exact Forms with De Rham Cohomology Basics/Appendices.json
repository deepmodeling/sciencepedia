            "problem": "Let $Q$ be a smooth $n$-dimensional manifold and let $T^{\\ast}Q$ denote its cotangent bundle. In local Darboux coordinates $(q^{1},\\dots,q^{n},p_{1},\\dots,p_{n})$ on $T^{\\ast}Q$, the tautological (Liouville) canonical $1$-form is defined by $\\theta=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_{i}\\,dq^{i}$. Working from the fundamental definition of the exterior derivative and the wedge product, derive the exterior derivative $d\\theta$ and express it with the wedge order $dq^{i}\\wedge dp_{i}$, starting from first principles without assuming any pre-stated formula.

Using Stokes' theorem and the exactness of $d\\theta$, compute the integral $\\oint_{C}\\theta$ as a closed-form expression in $\\Delta q$ and $\\Delta p$. Your final answer must be a single exact symbolic expression; do not round.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for two main results: first, the derivation of the exterior derivative $d\\theta$ of the tautological $1$-form $\\theta$, and second, the computation of a closed line integral $\\oint_C \\theta$ using Stokes' theorem.\n\nFirst, we derive the exterior derivative of the tautological $1$-form $\\theta = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_{i}\\,dq^{i}$. The exterior derivative operator $d$ is linear, so we can apply it to each term of the sum individually:\n$$\nd\\theta = d\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i}\\,dq^{i}\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} d(p_{i}\\,dq^{i})\n$$\nEach term $p_{i}\\,dq^{i}$ is the wedge product of a $0$-form (the coordinate function $p_i$) and a $1$-form ($dq^i$). We apply the graded Leibniz rule for the exterior derivative, which for a product of a $k$-form $\\alpha$ and a form $\\beta$ is $d(\\alpha \\wedge \\beta) = (d\\alpha) \\wedge \\beta + (-1)^{k} \\alpha \\wedge (d\\beta)$. In our case, $p_i$ is a $0$-form, so $k=0$. This gives:\n$$\nd(p_{i}\\,dq^{i}) = (dp_{i}) \\wedge dq^{i} + (-1)^{0} p_{i} \\wedge d(dq^{i})\n$$\nIn the local Darboux coordinates $(q^{1},\\dots,q^{n},p_{1},\\dots,p_{n})$, the quantities $p_i$ and $q^i$ are coordinate functions. The exterior derivative of the function $p_i$ is the $1$-form $dp_i$. The $1$-form $dq^i$ is itself an exact form, as it is the exterior derivative of the coordinate function $q^i$, i.e., $dq^i = d(q^i)$. A fundamental property of the exterior derivative is its nilpotency, $d^2 = d \\circ d = 0$. Applying this, we find:\n$$\nd(dq^{i}) = d(d(q^{i})) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $d(p_{i}\\,dq^{i})$ yields:\n$$\nd(p_{i}\\,dq^{i}) = dp_{i} \\wedge dq^{i} + p_{i} \\wedge 0 = dp_{i} \\wedge dq^{i}\n$$\nSumming over all indices $i$ from $1$ to $n$, we obtain the exterior derivative of $\\theta$:\n$$\nd\\theta = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} dp_{i} \\wedge dq^{i}\n$$\nThis is the canonical symplectic $2$-form on $T^*Q$ (up to a sign, depending on convention). The problem asks for this expression to be written with the wedge order $dq^{i}\\wedge dp_{i}$. Using the anti-commutative property of the wedge product, $dp_{i} \\wedge dq^{i} = -dq^{i} \\wedge dp_{i}$, we can write:\n$$\nd\\theta = -\\sum_{i=1}^{n} dq^{i} \\wedge dp_{i}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the integral $\\oint_{C}\\theta$ for the boundary $C = \\partial R$ of a specified rectangular $2$-cell $R$. The problem instructs us to use Stokes' theorem. For a $1$-form $\\alpha$ and a $2$-dimensional surface with boundary $S$, Stokes' theorem states $\\oint_{\\partial S} \\alpha = \\int_S d\\alpha$. Here, $\\alpha = \\theta$ and $S=R$, so we have:\n$$\n\\oint_{C}\\theta = \\int_R d\\theta\n$$\nThe rectangular $2$-cell $R$ is defined to lie in the $(q^{j},p_{j})$-plane for a fixed index $j$, with all other coordinates $q^k$ and $p_k$ (for $k \\neq j$) held constant. This implies that on the surface $R$, the differentials of these other coordinates are zero: $dq^k = 0$ and $dp_k = 0$ for all $k \\neq j$.\nWe must restrict the $2$-form $d\\theta$ to the surface $R$. When we do this, all terms in the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} dp_{i} \\wedge dq^{i}$ vanish except for the term with $i=j$:\n$$\n(d\\theta)|_R = dp_{j} \\wedge dq^{j}\n$$\nThe integral to be computed is therefore $\\int_R dp_{j} \\wedge dq^{j}$. The region of integration $R$ is given by $q^{j}\\in[q_{0},q_{0}+\\Delta q]$ and $p_{j}\\in[p_{0},p_{0}+\\Delta p]$.\nThe orientation of $R$ is specified by the ordered basis of tangent vectors $\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{j}},\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{j}}\\right)$. An integral of a $2$-form is computed by evaluating it on the basis vectors that define the orientation. The value of the $2$-form $dp_j \\wedge dq^j$ on this ordered basis is:\n$$\n(dp_{j} \\wedge dq^{j})\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{j}}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{j}}\\right) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} dp_{j}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{j}}) & dp_{j}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{j}}) \\\\ dq^{j}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{j}}) & dq^{j}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{j}}) \\end{pmatrix} = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = 1\n$$\nHere, we used the property that for coordinate differentials $dx^a$ and coordinate basis vectors $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^b}$, we have $dx^a(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^b}) = \\delta^a_b$.\nSince the $2$-form evaluates to a constant value of $1$ on the basis vectors defining the surface's orientation, the integral is simply the area of the region $R$ in the $(p_j, q_j)$ coordinate plane. We can write the integral explicitly using the coordinates $(p_j, q^j)$ to parametrize $R$. The specified orientation $(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_j}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^j})$ corresponds to integrating first with respect to $p_j$ and then $q^j$.\n$$\n\\int_R d\\theta = \\int_{q^{j}=q_{0}}^{q_{0}+\\Delta q} \\int_{p_{j}=p_{0}}^{p_{0}+\\Delta p} 1 \\, dp_{j} \\, dq^{j}\n$$\nEvaluating the inner integral:\n$$\n\\int_{p_{0}}^{p_{0}+\\Delta p} 1 \\, dp_{j} = [p_j]_{p_{0}}^{p_{0}+\\Delta p} = (p_{0}+\\Delta p) - p_{0} = \\Delta p\n$$\nNow evaluating the outer integral:\n$$\n\\int_{q_{0}}^{q_{0}+\\Delta q} \\Delta p \\, dq^{j} = \\Delta p \\int_{q_{0}}^{q_{0}+\\Delta q} 1 \\, dq^{j} = \\Delta p [q^j]_{q_{0}}^{q_{0}+\\Delta q} = \\Delta p ((q_{0}+\\Delta q) - q_{0}) = \\Delta p \\Delta q\n$$\nThe problem statement also mentions the \"exactness of $d\\theta$\". This refers to the property that $d\\theta$ can be expressed as the exterior derivative of another form, namely $\\theta$. This is precisely the condition that allows the use of Stokes' theorem. Furthermore, the nilpotency of the exterior derivative ($d^2=0$) implies $d(d\\theta) = 0$, meaning $d\\theta$ is a closed form. This fact places $d\\theta$ in the context of de Rham cohomology, identifying its cohomology class as trivial, $[d\\theta]=0 \\in H^2_{dR}(T^*Q)$. However, this latter fact is not directly required for the calculation.\n\nThe final result for the line integral is:\n$$\n\\oint_{C}\\theta = \\Delta p \\Delta q\n$$\nAs requested, the answer is an exact symbolic expression in $\\Delta q$ and $\\Delta p$. We present it with the conventional order matching area calculation.\n$$\n\\oint_{C}\\theta = \\Delta q \\Delta p\n$$",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the computation of the exterior derivative of a given $1$-form $\\alpha$ on the punctured plane $M=\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\{0\\}$, a determination of its circulation around the unit circle $S^1$, and a conclusion regarding its exactness on $M$. The analysis must be performed starting from fundamental definitions.\n\nThe given $1$-form is $\\alpha=\\frac{-y\\,dx+x\\,dy}{x^{2}+y^{2}}$. We can write this as $\\alpha = f(x, y)dx + g(x, y)dy$, where $f(x, y) = \\frac{-y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}$ and $g(x, y) = \\frac{x}{x^{2}+y^{2}}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the exterior derivative $d\\alpha$. By the linearity of the exterior derivative operator $d$, we have:\n$$\nd\\alpha = d(f(x, y)dx + g(x, y)dy) = d(f(x, y)dx) + d(g(x, y)dy)\n$$\nWe apply the product rule for exterior derivatives, which for a $0$-form (a function) $h$ and a $1$-form $\\omega$ is $d(h\\omega) = dh \\wedge \\omega + h d\\omega$. Here, $f$ and $g$ are $0$-forms, and $dx$ and $dy$ are $1$-forms. The exterior derivatives of the basis $1$-forms $dx$ and $dy$ are zero, i.e., $d(dx) = 0$ and $d(dy) = 0$.\nThus, for the first term:\n$$\nd(f\\,dx) = df \\wedge dx + f \\wedge d(dx) = df \\wedge dx\n$$\nThe exterior derivative of the function $f(x, y)$ is the $1$-form $df = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}dx + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}dy$. Substituting this, we get:\n$$\nd(f\\,dx) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}dx + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}dy\\right) \\wedge dx\n$$\nUsing the antisymmetry of the wedge product ($dx \\wedge dx = 0$ and $dy \\wedge dx = -dx \\wedge dy$), this simplifies to:\n$$\nd(f\\,dx) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(dx \\wedge dx) + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(dy \\wedge dx) = -\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} dx \\wedge dy\n$$\nSimilarly, for the second term:\n$$\nd(g\\,dy) = dg \\wedge dy = \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}dx + \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y}dy\\right) \\wedge dy = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}(dx \\wedge dy) + \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y}(dy \\wedge dy) = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} dx \\wedge dy\n$$\nCombining these results, we obtain the expression for $d\\alpha$:\n$$\nd\\alpha = \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) dx \\wedge dy\n$$\nNow, we compute the required partial derivatives.\nFor $f(x, y) = \\frac{-y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{-y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{(-1)(x^{2}+y^{2}) - (-y)(2y)}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}} = \\frac{-x^{2}-y^{2}+2y^{2}}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}} = \\frac{y^{2}-x^{2}}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}}\n$$\nFor $g(x, y) = \\frac{x}{x^{2}+y^{2}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{x}{x^{2}+y^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{(1)(x^{2}+y^{2}) - (x)(2x)}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}} = \\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}-2x^{2}}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}} = \\frac{y^{2}-x^{2}}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $d\\alpha$:\n$$\nd\\alpha = \\left(\\frac{y^{2}-x^{2}}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}} - \\frac{y^{2}-x^{2}}{(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}}\\right) dx \\wedge dy = 0 \\cdot dx \\wedge dy = 0\n$$\nA differential form whose exterior derivative is zero is called a **closed form**. Thus, $\\alpha$ is a closed $1$-form on $M$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the circulation $\\oint_{S^{1}}\\alpha$ around the unit circle $S^1$, which is the set of points $(x, y)$ such that $x^2+y^2=1$. We use the standard counterclockwise parametrization of $S^1$:\n$$\nx(t) = \\cos(t), \\quad y(t) = \\sin(t) \\quad \\text{for } t \\in [0, 2\\pi]\n$$\nThe differentials are $dx = \\frac{dx}{dt} dt = -\\sin(t) dt$ and $dy = \\frac{dy}{dt} dt = \\cos(t) dt$.\nThe line integral is computed by pulling back the form $\\alpha$ to the parameter space of $t$:\n$$\n\\oint_{S^{1}}\\alpha = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{-y(t)\\,dx(t) + x(t)\\,dy(t)}{x(t)^{2}+y(t)^{2}}\n$$\nOn $S^1$, the denominator is $x(t)^{2}+y(t)^{2} = \\cos^{2}(t)+\\sin^{2}(t) = 1$. The numerator becomes:\n$$\n-y(t)\\,dx(t) + x(t)\\,dy(t) = -\\sin(t)(-\\sin(t)dt) + \\cos(t)(\\cos(t)dt) = (\\sin^{2}(t) + \\cos^{2}(t))dt = 1 \\cdot dt\n$$\nSo the integral simplifies to:\n$$\n\\oint_{S^{1}}\\alpha = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{1 \\cdot dt}{1} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} dt = [t]_{0}^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi - 0 = 2\\pi\n$$\nThe value of the circulation is $2\\pi$ radians.\n\nFinally, we determine whether $\\alpha$ can be an **exact form** on $M$. A $1$-form $\\omega$ is defined as exact on a manifold if there exists a smooth function (a $0$-form) $h$ on that manifold such that $\\omega = dh$.\nA direct consequence of this definition, via the generalized Stokes' theorem (or the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals), is that the integral of an exact form over any closed loop must be zero. If $\\omega=dh$ and $\\gamma$ is a closed loop, then:\n$$\n\\oint_{\\gamma} \\omega = \\oint_{\\gamma} dh = h(P_{\\text{end}}) - h(P_{\\text{start}}) = 0\n$$\nsince the start and end points of a closed loop are identical, $P_{\\text{start}} = P_{\\text{end}}$.\nIn our case, we integrated the $1$-form $\\alpha$ over a closed loop, $S^1$, and found that:\n$$\n\\oint_{S^{1}}\\alpha = 2\\pi \\neq 0\n$$\nSince the integral is non-zero, $\\alpha$ cannot be an exact form on the manifold $M = \\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\{0\\}$.\n\nIn summary, we have shown that $\\alpha$ is a closed form ($d\\alpha = 0$) but not an exact form on $M$. This is a classic example demonstrating that a closed form is not necessarily exact on a manifold that is not simply connected. The punctured plane has a \"hole\" at the origin, which prevents $\\alpha$ from being exact. This is a foundational concept in de Rham cohomology, where $\\alpha$ represents a generator of the first cohomology group $H^1_{\\text{dR}}(\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\})$, which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$. The two quantities computed are the coefficient of $d\\alpha$ and the value of the integral.",

A $k$-form on an $n$-dimensional manifold is a top-degree form if $k=n$. The exterior derivative of any top-degree form is always zero. This is because $d\\omega$ would be a $(k+1)$-form, and the space of $(n+1)$-forms on an $n$-dimensional manifold is trivial (contains only the zero form). Since $S^2$ is a 2-dimensional manifold and $\\omega$ is a 2-form, $d\\omega$ must be a 3-form on $S^2$. Thus, $d\\omega = 0$ and $\\omega$ is a closed form.\n\n    Next, we address whether $\\omega$ is exact. A form is exact if it is the derivative of another form. If $\\omega$ were exact, there would exist a 1-form $\\alpha$ on $S^2$ such that $\\omega = d\\alpha$. We can test this hypothesis using Stokes' Theorem, which states that for any manifold-with-boundary $M$ and any form $\\eta$, $\\int_M d\\eta = \\int_{\\partial M} \\eta$. The 2-sphere $S^2$ is a compact manifold without boundary, so its boundary $\\partial S^2$ is the empty set.

Since we have found a closed 2-form, $\\omega$, that is not exact, its equivalence class $[\\omega]$ is a non-trivial (i.e., non-zero) element of $H^{2}_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^{2})$. A general theorem in topology states that for a compact, connected, orientable $n$-manifold $M$, the top cohomology group $H^n_{\\mathrm{dR}}(M)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$, with the isomorphism given by integration over the manifold. For $S^2$, this means $H^2_{\\mathrm{dR}}(S^2) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$. Our non-exact form $\\omega$ represents a generator of this group.
