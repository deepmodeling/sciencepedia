The original coordinates are $q=(q^1, q^2, q^3)=(x,y,z)$.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical foundation. A covector, or $1$-form, $\\alpha$ at a point $q \\in Q$ is an element of the cotangent space $T_q^*Q$, which is the dual space to the tangent space $T_qQ$.

From the chain rule applied to the coordinate functions themselves, we have:\n$$\ndq'^i = \\sum_{j=1}^3 \\frac{\\partial q'^i}{\\partial q^j} dq^j = \\sum_{j=1}^3 J^i{}_{j}(q) dq^j\n$$\nThis is the transformation law for the basis covectors.\n\nAn arbitrary covector $\\alpha \\in T_q^*Q$ can be expressed in either basis:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\sum_{j=1}^3 \\alpha_j dq^j = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\alpha'_i dq'^i\n$$\nTo find the relationship between the components $\\alpha_j$ and $\\alpha'_i$, we substitute the transformation for $dq'^i$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\alpha'_i \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^3 J^i{}_{j}(q) dq^j \\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^3 \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\alpha'_i J^i{}_{j}(q) \\right) dq^j\n$$\nBy comparing the coefficients of $dq^j$ with the original expression for $\\alpha$, we obtain the relationship between the components:\n$$\n\\alpha_j = \\sum_{i=1}^3 J^i{}_{j}(q) \\alpha'_i\n$$\nIn matrix notation, where components are arranged in column vectors, this reads $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = J^T \\boldsymbol{\\alpha'}$. To find the new components $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha'}$ from the old components $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$, we must invert this relationship:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\alpha'} = (J^T)^{-1} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = (J^{-1})^T \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\n$$\nIn index notation, this is $\\alpha'_i = \\sum_{j=1}^3 ((J^{-1})^T)^i{}_j \\alpha_j = \\sum_{j=1}^3 (J^{-1})^j{}_i \\alpha_j$, which agrees with the formula provided in the problem statement.\n\nNow, we perform the specific calculations for this problem.\nThe coordinate transformation is given by:\n$q'^1 = x+y^2z$\n$q'^2 = y+z^2x$\n$q'^3 = z+x^2y$\n\nFirst, we compute the Jacobian matrix $J(q) = \\frac{\\partial q'^i}{\\partial q^j}$:\n$$\nJ(x,y,z) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial q'^1}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial q'^1}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial q'^1}{\\partial z} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial q'^2}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial q'^2}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial q'^2}{\\partial z} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial q'^3}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial q'^3}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial q'^3}{\\partial z}\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2yz & y^2 \\\\\nz^2 & 1 & 2zx \\\\\n2xy & x^2 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe evaluate this matrix at the point $q=(x,y,z)=(1,2,-1)$:\n$$\nJ(1,2,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2(2)(-1) & 2^2 \\\\\n(-1)^2 & 1 & 2(-1)(1) \\\\\n2(1)(2) & 1^2 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -4 & 4 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -2 \\\\\n4 & 1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we must find the inverse of this matrix, which we denote as $A = J(1,2,-1)$. The inverse is $A^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(A)}\\text{adj}(A)$.\nThe determinant of $A$ is:\n$$\n\\det(A) = 1(1(1) - (-2)(1)) - (-4)(1(1) - (-2)(4)) + 4(1(1) - 1(4))\n$$\n$$\n\\det(A) = 1(1+2) + 4(1+8) + 4(1-4) = 3 + 36 - 12 = 27\n$$\nSince $\\det(A) \\neq 0$, the inverse exists. We now find the adjugate matrix, which is the transpose of the cofactor matrix. The cofactor matrix $C$ is:\n$$\nC = \\begin{pmatrix}\n+ (1 - (-2)) & - (1 - (-8)) & + (1-4) \\\\\n- (-4 - 4)  & + (1 - 16)  & - (1 - (-16)) \\\\\n+ (8 - 4)   & - (-2 - 4)  & + (1 - (-4))\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & -9 & -3 \\\\\n8 & -15 & -17 \\\\\n4 & 6 & 5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe adjugate matrix is $\\text{adj}(A) = C^T$:\n$$\n\\text{adj}(A) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & 8 & 4 \\\\\n-9 & -15 & 6 \\\\\n-3 & -17 & 5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThus, the inverse Jacobian matrix is:\n$$\nJ^{-1}(1,2,-1) = A^{-1} = \\frac{1}{27} \\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & 8 & 4 \\\\\n-9 & -15 & 6 \\\\\n-3 & -17 & 5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe need the transpose of this matrix for the component transformation:\n$$\n(J^{-1})^T(1,2,-1) = (A^{-1})^T = \\frac{1}{27} \\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & -9 & -3 \\\\\n8 & -15 & -17 \\\\\n4 & 6 & 5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe given covector is $\\alpha = 3\\,dq^1 - 2\\,dq^2 + 5\\,dq^3$, so its components in the $q$-coordinate system are $\\alpha_1=3$, $\\alpha_2=-2$, $\\alpha_3=5$. We represent these as a column vector $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nNow we apply the transformation law $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha'} = (J^{-1})^T \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha'_1 \\\\ \\alpha'_2 \\\\ \\alpha'_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{27} \\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & -9 & -3 \\\\\n8 & -15 & -17 \\\\\n4 & 6 & 5\n\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha'_1 \\\\ \\alpha'_2 \\\\ \\alpha'_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{27} \\begin{pmatrix}\n(3)(3) + (-9)(-2) + (-3)(5) \\\\\n(8)(3) + (-15)(-2) + (-17)(5) \\\\\n(4)(3) + (6)(-2) + (5)(5)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha'_1 \\\\ \\alpha'_2 \\\\ \\alpha'_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{27} \\begin{pmatrix}\n9 + 18 - 15 \\\\\n24 + 30 - 85 \\\\\n12 - 12 + 25\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{27} \\begin{pmatrix}\n12 \\\\\n-31 \\\\\n25\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe components of the covector $\\alpha$ in the $q'$-coordinates are:\n$$\n\\alpha'_1 = \\frac{12}{27} = \\frac{4}{9}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha'_2 = -\\frac{31}{27}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha'_3 = \\frac{25}{27}\n$$\nThe components are $(\\frac{4}{9}, -\\frac{31}{27}, \\frac{25}{27})$.",
