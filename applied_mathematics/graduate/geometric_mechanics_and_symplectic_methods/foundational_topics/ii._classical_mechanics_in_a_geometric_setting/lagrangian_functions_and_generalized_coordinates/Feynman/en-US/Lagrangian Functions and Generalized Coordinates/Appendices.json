            "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of a point particle in a central potential field using Lagrangian mechanics. The tasks include expressing the Lagrangian in polar coordinates, deriving and comparing the Euler–Lagrange equations in Cartesian and polar coordinates, and identifying the conserved quantity associated with rotational symmetry.\n\n1. Derivation of the Lagrangian in Polar Coordinates\n\nThe relationship between Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$ and polar coordinates $(r,\\theta)$ is given by:\n$$x = r \\cos(\\theta)$$\n$$y = r \\sin(\\theta)$$\nThe configuration space $\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$ ensures that $r > 0$. We find the time derivatives of the Cartesian coordinates using the chain rule:\n$$\\dot{x} = \\frac{d}{dt}(r \\cos(\\theta)) = \\dot{r}\\cos(\\theta) - r\\dot{\\theta}\\sin(\\theta)$$\n$$\\dot{y} = \\frac{d}{dt}(r \\sin(\\theta)) = \\dot{r}\\sin(\\theta) + r\\dot{\\theta}\\cos(\\theta)$$\nThe kinetic energy $T$ is given by $T = \\frac{m}{2}(\\dot{x}^{2} + \\dot{y}^{2})$. We substitute the expressions for $\\dot{x}$ and $\\dot{y}$:\n$$ \\dot{x}^{2} + \\dot{y}^{2} = (\\dot{r}\\cos(\\theta) - r\\dot{\\theta}\\sin(\\theta))^{2} + (\\dot{r}\\sin(\\theta) + r\\dot{\\theta}\\cos(\\theta))^{2} $$\n$$ \\dot{x}^{2} + \\dot{y}^{2} = (\\dot{r}^{2}\\cos^{2}(\\theta) - 2r\\dot{r}\\dot{\\theta}\\cos(\\theta)\\sin(\\theta) + r^{2}\\dot{\\theta}^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\theta)) + (\\dot{r}^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\theta) + 2r\\dot{r}\\dot{\\theta}\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) + r^{2}\\dot{\\theta}^{2}\\cos^{2}(\\theta)) $$\nThe cross terms cancel, and using the identity $\\cos^{2}(\\theta) + \\sin^{2}(\\theta) = 1$, we simplify the expression:\n$$ \\dot{x}^{2} + \\dot{y}^{2} = \\dot{r}^{2}(\\cos^{2}(\\theta) + \\sin^{2}(\\theta)) + r^{2}\\dot{\\theta}^{2}(\\sin^{2}(\\theta) + \\cos^{2}(\\theta)) = \\dot{r}^{2} + r^{2}\\dot{\\theta}^{2} $$\nThus, the kinetic energy in polar coordinates is:\n$$ T = \\frac{m}{2}(\\dot{r}^{2} + r^{2}\\dot{\\theta}^{2}) $$\nThe potential energy $V = V(r)$ is already a function of $r$. The Lagrangian $L = T-V$ in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\dot{r}, \\dot{\\theta})$ is:\n$$ L(r, \\theta, \\dot{r}, \\dot{\\theta}) = \\frac{m}{2}(\\dot{r}^{2} + r^{2}\\dot{\\theta}^{2}) - V(r) $$\n\n2. Euler–Lagrange Equations and Equivalence\n\nThe Euler–Lagrange equation for a generalized coordinate $q_i$ is $\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q_i} = 0$.\n\nIn Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$, the Lagrangian is $L = \\frac{m}{2}(\\dot{x}^{2} + \\dot{y}^{2}) - V(\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}})$.\nFor coordinate $x$: $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}} = m\\dot{x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{dV}{dr}\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial x} = -V'(r)\\frac{x}{r}$. The equation is $m\\ddot{x} + \\frac{x}{r}V'(r) = 0$.\nFor coordinate $y$: $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{y}} = m\\dot{y}$ and $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{dV}{dr}\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial y} = -V'(r)\\frac{y}{r}$. The equation is $m\\ddot{y} + \\frac{y}{r}V'(r) = 0$.\n\nIn polar coordinates $(r,\\theta)$, the Lagrangian is $L = \\frac{m}{2}(\\dot{r}^{2} + r^{2}\\dot{\\theta}^{2}) - V(r)$.\nFor coordinate $r$: $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{r}} = m\\dot{r}$ and $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial r} = mr\\dot{\\theta}^{2} - V'(r)$. The equation is $m\\ddot{r} - mr\\dot{\\theta}^{2} + V'(r) = 0$.\nFor coordinate $\\theta$: $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} = mr^{2}\\dot{\\theta}$ and $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$. The equation is $\\frac{d}{dt}(mr^{2}\\dot{\\theta}) = 0$.\n\nTo show equivalence, we express Newton's second law in the polar basis. The Cartesian equations $m\\ddot{x} = -\\frac{x}{r}V'(r)$ and $m\\ddot{y} = -\\frac{y}{r}V'(r)$ combine into the vector equation $m\\vec{a} = \\vec{F}$, where $\\vec{a}=(\\ddot{x}, \\ddot{y})$ and the force is $\\vec{F} = -V'(r) \\frac{(x,y)}{r} = -V'(r)\\hat{e}_r$. The acceleration vector $\\vec{a}$ in polar coordinates is $\\vec{a} = (\\ddot{r} - r\\dot{\\theta}^{2})\\hat{e}_r + (r\\ddot{\\theta} + 2\\dot{r}\\dot{\\theta})\\hat{e}_\\theta$.\nEquating $m\\vec{a}$ with $\\vec{F}$:\n$$ m((\\ddot{r} - r\\dot{\\theta}^{2})\\hat{e}_r + (r\\ddot{\\theta} + 2\\dot{r}\\dot{\\theta})\\hat{e}_\\theta) = -V'(r)\\hat{e}_r $$\nComparing components:\nThe radial ($\\hat{e}_r$) component gives $m(\\ddot{r} - r\\dot{\\theta}^{2}) = -V'(r)$, which is precisely the Euler–Lagrange equation for $r$.\nThe tangential ($\\hat{e}_\\theta$) component gives $m(r\\ddot{\\theta} + 2\\dot{r}\\dot{\\theta}) = 0$. Since $m \\neq 0$ and $r \\neq 0$, this simplifies to $r\\ddot{\\theta} + 2\\dot{r}\\dot{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dt}(r^2 \\dot{\\theta}) = 0$. This implies $\\frac{d}{dt}(mr^{2}\\dot{\\theta}) = 0$, which is the Euler–Lagrange equation for $\\theta$. This demonstrates the equivalence of the two sets of equations.\n\n3. Conserved Quantity\n\nThe problem asks for the conserved quantity associated with rotational invariance. The Lagrangian in polar coordinates, $L = \\frac{m}{2}(\\dot{r}^{2} + r^{2}\\dot{\\theta}^{2}) - V(r)$, does not depend on the angular coordinate $\\theta$. This independence signifies the rotational symmetry of the system. A coordinate that does not appear explicitly in the Lagrangian is called a cyclic or ignorable coordinate.\nAccording to Noether's theorem, for every cyclic coordinate, the corresponding generalized momentum is a conserved quantity. The generalized momentum $p_k$ corresponding to a coordinate $q_k$ is defined as $p_k = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_k}$.\nFor the cyclic coordinate $\\theta$, the conserved generalized momentum is $p_\\theta$:\n$$ p_\\theta = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}}\\left(\\frac{m}{2}(\\dot{r}^{2} + r^{2}\\dot{\\theta}^{2}) - V(r)\\right) $$\nPerforming the differentiation:\n$$ p_\\theta = \\frac{m}{2} \\cdot (r^{2} \\cdot 2\\dot{\\theta}) = mr^{2}\\dot{\\theta} $$\nThe conservation of $p_\\theta$ is explicitly confirmed by the Euler–Lagrange equation for $\\theta$, which we found to be $\\frac{d(p_\\theta)}{dt} = 0$. This quantity, $mr^{2}\\dot{\\theta}$, is the magnitude of the particle's angular momentum about the origin. It is expressed solely in terms of the mass $m$, the polar generalized coordinate $r$, and its time derivative $\\dot{\\theta}$.",

The term $T = \\frac{1}{2}\\,g_{ij}(q)\\,\\dot{q}^{i}\\dot{q}^{j}$ represents the kinetic energy, and $V(q)$ is the potential energy.\n\nThe first step is to define the canonical momenta $p_i$ conjugate to the generalized coordinates $q^i$. By definition, the canonical momenta are the components of the fiber derivative of the Lagrangian:\n$$\np_{k} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}^{k}}\n$$\nWe apply this definition to the given Lagrangian. The potential $V(q)$ is independent of the generalized velocities $\\dot{q}^{k}$, so its partial derivative with respect to $\\dot{q}^{k}$ is zero. We have:\n$$\np_{k} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\dot{q}^{k}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\,g_{ij}(q)\\,\\dot{q}^{i}\\dot{q}^{j} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the product rule for differentiation and the fact that $\\frac{\\partial \\dot{q}^{i}}{\\partial \\dot{q}^{k}} = \\delta^{i}_{k}$ (the Kronecker delta), we get:\n$$\np_{k} = \\frac{1}{2}\\,g_{ij}(q) \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\dot{q}^{i}}{\\partial \\dot{q}^{k}}\\dot{q}^{j} + \\dot{q}^{i}\\frac{\\partial \\dot{q}^{j}}{\\partial \\dot{q}^{k}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\,g_{ij}(q) \\left( \\delta^{i}_{k}\\dot{q}^{j} + \\dot{q}^{i}\\delta^{j}_{k} \\right)\n$$\nContracting with the Kronecker deltas yields:\n$$\np_{k} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( g_{kj}(q)\\,\\dot{q}^{j} + g_{ik}(q)\\,\\dot{q}^{i} \\right)\n$$\nSince the metric tensor $g$ is symmetric ($g_{ik} = g_{ki}$), and the indices $i$ and $j$ in the summation are dummy indices, we can rename the index $i$ to $j$ in the second term, $g_{ik}(q)\\,\\dot{q}^{i} = g_{jk}(q)\\,\\dot{q}^{j} = g_{kj}(q)\\,\\dot{q}^{j}$.

This mapping is the Legendre transform from the tangent bundle $TQ$ to the cotangent bundle $T^*Q$.\n\nTo express the Hamiltonian in terms of coordinates $(q,p)$ on $T^*Q$, we must first express the velocities $\\dot{q}^{j}$ in terms of the momenta $p_k$. This is achieved by inverting the relationship above. We use the inverse metric tensor, denoted by $g^{ik}(q)$, which is defined by the property $g^{ik}(q)g_{kj}(q) = \\delta^{i}_{j}$.
