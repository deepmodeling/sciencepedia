            "problem": "Consider a smooth configuration manifold $Q$ of dimension $n$ with local coordinates $q = (q^{1},\\dots,q^{n})$. Let $TQ$ denote its tangent bundle with induced local fiber coordinates $v = \\dot{q} = (\\dot{q}^{1},\\dots,\\dot{q}^{n})$. Let the Lagrangian be of the mechanical type\n$$\nL(q,v) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2}\\, v^{\\top} M(q)\\, v \\;+\\; b(q)\\cdot v \\;-\\; V(q),\n$$\nwhere $M(q)$ is a smooth $n\\times n$ matrix-valued function, $b(q)$ is a smooth $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$-valued function, and $V(q)$ is a smooth real-valued function. Hamilton’s principle states that physical trajectories make the action $S[q] = \\int L(q,\\dot{q})\\, dt$ stationary among variations with fixed endpoints, and the Euler–Lagrange equations follow.

            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the Jacobian of the fiber derivative (Legendre transform) for a given Lagrangian, and the determination of the conditions under which this transformation is a diffeomorphism (i.e., the Lagrangian is hyperregular).\n\nThe given Lagrangian is of the mechanical type:\n$$\nL(q,v) = \\frac{1}{2}\\, v^{\\top} M(q)\\, v + b(q)\\cdot v - V(q)\n$$\nwhere $q = (q^1, \\dots, q^n)$ are local coordinates on the configuration manifold $Q$, and $v = \\dot{q} = (v^1, \\dots, v^n)$ are the corresponding fiber coordinates on the tangent bundle $TQ$. $M(q)$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix-valued function, $b(q)$ is an $\\mathbb{R}^n$-valued function (a vector field), and $V(q)$ is a scalar potential.\n\nTo perform calculations, we write the Lagrangian in index notation:\n$$\nL(q,v) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j=1}^n M_{ij}(q) v^i v^j + \\sum_{i=1}^n b_i(q) v^i - V(q)\n$$\nThe fiber derivative $\\mathcal{F}L: TQ \\to T^*Q$ maps coordinates $(q,v)$ to $(q,p)$, where the conjugate momentum $p = (p_1, \\dots, p_n)$ is defined by $p_k = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v^k}$. Let's compute the components of $p$:\n$$\np_k = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^k} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j} M_{ij}(q) v^i v^j + \\sum_i b_i(q) v^i - V(q) \\right)\n$$\nThe derivative of the quadratic term is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^k} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j} M_{ij} v^i v^j \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j} M_{ij} \\left( \\frac{\\partial v^i}{\\partial v^k} v^j + v^i \\frac{\\partial v^j}{\\partial v^k} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j} M_{ij} (\\delta^i_k v^j + v^i \\delta^j_k)\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\sum_j M_{kj} v^j + \\sum_i M_{ik} v^i \\right)\n$$\nThis expression depends on both $M$ and its transpose $M^\\top$. Let's rewrite it:\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_j (M_{kj} + M_{jk}) v^j\n$$\nThe derivative of the linear term is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^k} (\\sum_i b_i v^i) = b_k$. The potential term $V(q)$ is independent of $v$, so its derivative is zero.\nCombining the terms, the momentum is:\n$$\np_k(q,v) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^n (M_{kj}(q) + M_{jk}(q)) v^j + b_k(q)\n$$\nIt is standard to introduce the symmetric part of the matrix $M(q)$, denoted $\\tilde{M}(q)$, with entries $\\tilde{M}_{kj}(q) = \\frac{1}{2}(M_{kj}(q) + M_{jk}(q))$. In matrix notation, $\\tilde{M}(q) = \\frac{1}{2}(M(q) + M(q)^\\top)$. The momentum map is then concisely written in vector form as:\n$$\np(q,v) = \\tilde{M}(q)v + b(q)\n$$\nThe fiber derivative $\\mathcal{F}L$ is the map from $TQ$ to $T^*Q$ given in local coordinates by $\\mathcal{F}L(q,v) = (q, p(q,v))$. We are asked to find its Jacobian, which is a $2n \\times 2n$ matrix representing the total derivative of this map with respect to the coordinate vector $(q, v)$. The Jacobian matrix has a block structure:\n$$\nD(\\mathcal{F}L)(q,v) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial q} & \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial v} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial q} & \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial v} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe compute each of the four $n \\times n$ blocks:\n1.  **Top-left block**: $\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial q}$. The entries are $(\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial q})_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial q^i}{\\partial q^j} = \\delta_{ij}$. This block is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix, $I_n$.\n2.  **Top-right block**: $\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial v}$. The entries are $(\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial v})_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial q^i}{\\partial v^j} = 0$, since $q$ does not depend on $v$. This block is the $n \\times n$ zero matrix, $0_n$.\n3.  **Bottom-right block**: $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial v}$. The entries are $(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial v})_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial p_i}{\\partial v^j}$. Using the expression for $p_i$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial p_i}{\\partial v^j} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^j} \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n \\tilde{M}_{ik}(q) v^k + b_i(q) \\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\tilde{M}_{ik}(q) \\frac{\\partial v^k}{\\partial v^j} = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\tilde{M}_{ik}(q) \\delta_{kj} = \\tilde{M}_{ij}(q)\n    $$\n    So, this block is the matrix $\\tilde{M}(q) = \\frac{1}{2}(M(q) + M(q)^\\top)$.\n4.  **Bottom-left block**: $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial q}$. The entries are $(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial q})_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial p_i}{\\partial q^j}$. This requires differentiating the expression for $p_i$ with respect to the components of $q$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial p_i}{\\partial q^j} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^j} \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n \\tilde{M}_{ik}(q) v^k + b_i(q) \\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{M}_{ik}(q)}{\\partial q^j} v^k + \\frac{\\partial b_i(q)}{\\partial q^j}\n    $$\n    Substituting back $\\tilde{M}_{ik} = \\frac{1}{2}(M_{ik} + M_{ki})$, we obtain the final expression for the entry:\n    $$\n    \\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial q}\\right)_{ij} = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial M_{ik}(q)}{\\partial q^j} + \\frac{\\partial M_{ki}(q)}{\\partial q^j} \\right) v^k + \\frac{\\partial b_i(q)}{\\partial q^j}\n    $$\nAssembling these blocks, the Jacobian of the fiber derivative is:\n$$\nD(\\mathcal{F}L)(q,v) = \\begin{pmatrix} I_n & 0_n \\\\ \\left[\\frac{\\partial p_i}{\\partial q^j}\\right] & \\tilde{M}(q) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere the $(i,j)$-th entry of the bottom-left block is the expression derived above.\n\nNext, we determine the condition for the Lagrangian $L$ to be hyperregular. By definition, $L$ is hyperregular if the fiber derivative $\\mathcal{F}L: TQ \\to T^*Q$ is a diffeomorphism. A diffeomorphism is a smooth map that has a smooth inverse.\n\nAccording to the Inverse Function Theorem, a smooth map is a local diffeomorphism at a point if and only if its Jacobian matrix is invertible at that point. The Jacobian of $\\mathcal{F}L$ is block lower triangular, so its determinant is the product of the determinants of its diagonal blocks:\n$$\n\\det(D(\\mathcal{F}L)(q,v)) = \\det(I_n) \\det(\\tilde{M}(q)) = \\det(\\tilde{M}(q))\n$$\nFor $\\mathcal{F}L$ to be a local diffeomorphism everywhere, its Jacobian must be invertible for all $(q,v) \\in TQ$. This requires $\\det(\\tilde{M}(q)) \\neq 0$ for all $q \\in Q$. This means the symmetric part of the kinetic energy matrix, $\\tilde{M}(q)$, must be non-singular (invertible) on the entire manifold $Q$.\n\nLet's check if this condition is also sufficient for $\\mathcal{F}L$ to be a global diffeomorphism. We must show that the map is bijective and that its inverse is smooth. The map is $\\mathcal{F}L(q,v) = (q', p')$ with $q'=q$ and $p' = \\tilde{M}(q)v + b(q)$. To find the inverse map, we solve for $(q,v)$ in terms of $(q',p')$. Clearly, $q=q'$. We then solve for $v$:\n$$\np' = \\tilde{M}(q')v + b(q') \\implies \\tilde{M}(q')v = p' - b(q')\n$$\nIf $\\tilde{M}(q')$ is invertible, we can find a unique solution for $v$:\n$$\nv = (\\tilde{M}(q'))^{-1} (p' - b(q'))\n$$\nThis defines the inverse map $\\mathcal{F}L^{-1}: T^*Q \\to TQ$ as $\\mathcal{F}L^{-1}(q',p') = (q', (\\tilde{M}(q'))^{-1}(p' - b(q')))$. The map is well-defined and bijective if and only if $\\tilde{M}(q)$ is invertible for all $q \\in Q$.\nFurthermore, if this condition holds, the inverse map is smooth. Since $M(q)$ and $b(q)$ are smooth, $\\tilde{M}(q)$ is also smooth. The entries of the inverse matrix $(\\tilde{M}(q))^{-1}$ are rational functions of the entries of $\\tilde{M}(q)$ (via the adjugate matrix formula), and since the determinant is non-zero, the inverse is also a smooth function of $q$. Therefore, the map $\\mathcal{F}L^{-1}$ is smooth.\n\nThus, the necessary and sufficient condition for the Lagrangian $L$ to be hyperregular is that the matrix $\\tilde{M}(q) = \\frac{1}{2}(M(q) + M(q)^\\top)$ is non-singular for all $q \\in Q$.\n\nThe problem asks for the Jacobian matrix as the final answer. We present it in block form, with the entries of each block specified.",

            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the local invertibility of the fiber derivative (Legendre transformation) for a given Lagrangian and the identification of the primary constraint submanifold in the cotangent bundle $T^*Q$. The configuration manifold is $Q=\\mathbb{R}^2$ with coordinates $(q_1, q_2)$. The tangent bundle $TQ$ has induced coordinates $(q_1, q_2, v_1, v_2)$. The Lagrangian $L: TQ \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is given by:\n$$L(q,v) = \\frac{1}{2}(1+q_1^2)v_1^2 + q_2 v_1 + \\sin(q_1)v_2 - U(q)$$\nwhere $U(q)$ is a potential energy function. The cotangent bundle $T^*Q$ has coordinates $(q_1, q_2, p_1, p_2)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the generalized momenta $p_i$ by computing the partial derivatives of the Lagrangian $L$ with respect to the generalized velocities $v_i$. The fiber derivative $\\mathcal{F}L: TQ \\to T^*Q$ maps $(q,v)$ to $(q,p)$ where $p_i = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v_i}$.\n\nFor $p_1$, we have:\n$$p_1 = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v_1} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v_1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(1+q_1^2)v_1^2 + q_2 v_1 + \\sin(q_1)v_2 - U(q)\\right)$$\n$$p_1 = (1+q_1^2)v_1 + q_2$$\n\nFor $p_2$, we have:\n$$p_2 = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v_2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v_2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(1+q_1^2)v_1^2 + q_2 v_1 + \\sin(q_1)v_2 - U(q)\\right)$$\n$$p_2 = \\sin(q_1)$$\n\nThe map from velocities $v=(v_1, v_2)$ to momenta $p=(p_1, p_2)$ for a fixed configuration $q=(q_1, q_2)$ is given by these two equations. The local invertibility of this map, and thus of the fiber derivative $\\mathcal{F}L$, depends on whether we can uniquely solve for the velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$ in terms of the momenta $p_1$, $p_2$ and the configuration $q_1$, $q_2$.\n\nAccording to the inverse function theorem, this map is locally invertible if and only if its Jacobian matrix is non-singular. The Jacobian matrix is the Hessian matrix of the Lagrangian with respect to the velocities, $W_{ij}(q,v) = \\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial v_i \\partial v_j}$. A Lagrangian is termed regular if this matrix is invertible, and singular otherwise.\n\nLet's compute the components of the Hessian matrix $W$:\n$$W_{11} = \\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial v_1^2} = \\frac{\\partial p_1}{\\partial v_1} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v_1}((1+q_1^2)v_1 + q_2) = 1+q_1^2$$\n$$W_{12} = \\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial v_1 \\partial v_2} = \\frac{\\partial p_1}{\\partial v_2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v_2}((1+q_1^2)v_1 + q_2) = 0$$\n$$W_{21} = \\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial v_2 \\partial v_1} = \\frac{\\partial p_2}{\\partial v_1} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v_1}(\\sin(q_1)) = 0$$\n$$W_{22} = \\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial v_2^2} = \\frac{\\partial p_2}{\\partial v_2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v_2}(\\sin(q_1)) = 0$$\n\nThe Hessian matrix is therefore:\n$$W(q,v) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1+q_1^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe determinant of this matrix is $\\det(W) = (1+q_1^2)(0) - (0)(0) = 0$. Since the determinant is zero for all points $(q,v) \\in TQ$, the Hessian matrix is singular everywhere. This implies that the Lagrangian is singular, and the fiber derivative $\\mathcal{F}L$ is not locally invertible at any point.\n\nThe singularity of the Legendre transformation implies the existence of primary constraints. These are relationships among the phase space variables $(q,p)$ that are independent of the velocities $v$. We can find these by examining the equations for the momenta:\n1.  $p_1 = (1+q_1^2)v_1 + q_2$\n2.  $p_2 = \\sin(q_1)$\n\nThe second equation, $p_2 = \\sin(q_1)$, is a relationship between the phase space coordinates $(q_1, p_2)$ that does not involve any velocities. This equation must hold for any point $(q,p)$ that lies in the image of the fiber derivative $\\mathcal{F}L$. This relation defines the primary constraint submanifold as a subset of the cotangent bundle $T^*Q$.\n\nThe first equation can be solved for $v_1$:\n$$v_1 = \\frac{p_1 - q_2}{1+q_1^2}$$\nThis is well-defined because $1+q_1^2 \\ge 1$ for all real $q_1$. However, the velocity $v_2$ does not appear in any of the equations defining the momenta. This is the source of the singularity.\n\nThe primary constraint submanifold is the set of points in $T^*Q$ where the constraint relations hold. The problem asks for a single analytic expression for a constraint function $\\phi(q,p)$ whose zero set, $\\phi(q,p)=0$, defines this submanifold. From the relation $p_2 = \\sin(q_1)$, we can define the constraint function $\\phi$ as:\n$$\\phi(q,p) = p_2 - \\sin(q_1)$$\nThe primary constraint submanifold is then the set $\\{(q,p) \\in T^*Q \\mid p_2 - \\sin(q_1) = 0\\}$.

The action over the subinterval is then approximated by the discrete Lagrangian, $L_d$:\n$$\n\\int_{t_k}^{t_{k+1}} L(q, \\dot{q}) dt \\approx L_d(q_k, q_{k+1}) = h L\\left(\\frac{q_k + q_{k+1}}{2}, \\frac{q_{k+1} - q_k}{h}\\right)\n$$\nThe total discrete action over the entire path $\\{q_k\\}_{k=0}^N$ is the sum:\n$$\nS_d(\\{q_k\\}) = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} L_d(q_k, q_{k+1})\n$$\n\n**2. Discrete Euler-Lagrange Equations**\nThe discrete version of Hamilton's principle requires that the discrete action be stationary with respect to variations in the interior path points. That is, $\\delta S_d = 0$ for all variations $\\delta q_k$ such that the endpoints are fixed ($\\delta q_0 = \\delta q_N = 0$).\n\n$$\n\\delta S_d = \\delta \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} L_d(q_k, q_{k+1}) = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\left( \\frac{\\partial L_d(q_k, q_{k+1})}{\\partial q_k} \\delta q_k + \\frac{\\partial L_d(q_k, q_{k+1})}{\\partial q_{k+1}} \\delta q_{k+1} \\right) = 0\n$$\nUsing the notation $D_1 L_d$ and $D_2 L_d$ for the partial derivatives with respect to the first and second arguments, we have:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\left( D_1 L_d(q_k, q_{k+1}) \\cdot \\delta q_k + D_2 L_d(q_k, q_{k+1}) \\cdot \\delta q_{k+1} \\right) = 0\n$$\nBy re-indexing the sum over $\\delta q_{k+1}$ and collecting terms for each $\\delta q_k$, we get:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{N-1} \\left( D_2 L_d(q_{k-1}, q_k) + D_1 L_d(q_k, q_{k+1}) \\right) \\cdot \\delta q_k = 0\n$$\nSince the variations $\\delta q_k$ are arbitrary for $k=1, \\dots, N-1$, the term in the parenthesis must be zero. This yields the **Discrete Euler-Lagrange (DEL) equations**:\n$$\nD_1 L_d(q_k, q_{k+1}) + D_2 L_d(q_{k-1}, q_k) = 0\n$$\nThis equation provides a relationship between three consecutive configurations $q_{k-1}, q_k, q_{k+1}$.\n\n**3. Discrete Momenta and the One-Step Method**\nTo formulate a one-step method, we define discrete momenta in a way that is consistent with the DEL equations. We define:\n$$\np_k := -D_1 L_d(q_k, q_{k+1})\n$$\n$$\np_{k+1} := D_2 L_d(q_k, q_{k+1})\n$$\nSubstituting these definitions into the DEL equation gives $D_1 L_d(q_k, q_{k+1}) + D_2 L_d(q_{k-1}, q_k) = -p_k + p_k = 0$, which is satisfied identically. The pair of equations for $p_k$ and $p_{k+1}$ defines the integrator. Let's compute the derivatives for our specific Lagrangian $L(q,\\dot{q}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\dot{q}^T M \\dot{q} - V(q)$:\n$$\nL_d(q_k, q_{k+1}) = h \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{q_{k+1}-q_k}{h}\\right)^T M \\left(\\frac{q_{k+1}-q_k}{h}\\right) - V\\left(\\frac{q_k+q_{k+1}}{2}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThe partial derivatives are (using vector calculus identities and symmetry of $M$):\n$$\nD_1 L_d(q_k, q_{k+1}) = h \\left[ -\\frac{1}{h^2} M(q_{k+1}-q_k) - \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla V\\left(\\frac{q_k+q_{k+1}}{2}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nD_2 L_d(q_k, q_{k+1}) = h \\left[ \\frac{1}{h^2} M(q_{k+1}-q_k) - \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla V\\left(\\frac{q_k+q_{k+1}}{2}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nSubstituting these into the momentum definitions:\n$$\np_k = -D_1 L_d = \\frac{1}{h}M(q_{k+1}-q_k) + \\frac{h}{2}\\nabla V\\left(\\frac{q_k+q_{k+1}}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\np_{k+1} = D_2 L_d = \\frac{1}{h}M(q_{k+1}-q_k) - \\frac{h}{2}\\nabla V\\left(\\frac{q_k+q_{k+1}}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThese two equations implicitly define the mapping $(q_k, p_k) \\mapsto (q_{k+1}, p_{k+1})$. To make them more suitable for implementation, we can manipulate them. Subtracting the second from the first gives $p_k - p_{k+1} = h \\nabla V(\\frac{q_k+q_{k+1}}{2})$, which rearranges to:\n$$\np_{k+1} = p_k - h \\nabla V\\left(\\frac{q_k+q_{k+1}}{2}\\right)\n$$\nAdding the two equations gives $p_k + p_{k+1} = \\frac{2}{h}M(q_{k+1}-q_k)$. Rearranging for $q_{k+1}$ gives:\n$$\nq_{k+1} = q_k + \\frac{h}{2} M^{-1} (p_k+p_{k+1})\n$$\nThese two coupled equations define the integrator, known as the implicit midpoint rule or Störmer-Verlet method. To implement it, we must solve for $(q_{k+1}, p_{k+1})$ given $(q_k, p_k)$. Substituting the expression for $p_{k+1}$ into the one for $q_{k+1}$ yields a single implicit equation for $q_{k+1}$:\n$$\nq_{k+1} = q_k + h M^{-1} p_k - \\frac{h^2}{2} M^{-1} \\nabla V\\left(\\frac{q_k+q_{k+1}}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThis nonlinear equation for $q_{k+1}$ can be written as $F(q_{k+1})=0$ and solved using a numerical root-finding algorithm, such as Newton's method. Once $q_{k+1}$ is found, $p_{k+1}$ is computed explicitly.\n\n### Analysis of the Method\n\n**Order of Accuracy**: The midpoint rule used to approximate the action integral is second-order accurate, meaning the error in $L_d$ is $O(h^3)$. The resulting discrete Euler-Lagrange equations approximate the continuous Euler-Lagrange equations to second-order accuracy. Consequently, the local truncation error of the numerical method is $O(h^3)$, which leads to a global error of $O(h^2)$. The method is second-order accurate, and the numerical convergence rate $r$ should be approximately $2$.\n\n**Symplecticity**: A key property of variational integrators is that they are symplectic. A map $\\Phi: (q, p) \\mapsto (q', p')$ is symplectic if it preserves the canonical symplectic 2-form, i.e., $dq' \\wedge dp' = dq \\wedge dp$. From the definitions of the discrete momenta, we have:\n$$\np_k \\cdot dq_k - p_{k+1} \\cdot dq_{k+1} = -D_1 L_d(q_k, q_{k+1}) \\cdot dq_k - D_2 L_d(q_k, q_{k+1}) \\cdot dq_{k+1} = -d L_d(q_k, q_{k+1})\n$$\nTaking the exterior derivative of this expression yields:\n$$\nd(p_k \\cdot dq_k - p_{k+1} \\cdot dq_{k+1}) = -d(d L_d(q_k, q_{k+1}))\n$$\nSince the exterior derivative of an exact form is zero ($d(d f) = 0$ for any function $f$), we have:\n$$\nd(p_k \\cdot dq_k) - d(p_{k+1} \\cdot dq_{k+1}) = 0\n$$\nNoting that $d(p \\cdot dq) = dp \\wedge dq$, this simplifies to $dp_k \\wedge dq_k = dp_{k+1} \\wedge dq_{k+1}$, which proves that the map is symplectic. This property ensures excellent long-term energy and momentum conservation behavior for Hamiltonian systems. The numerical test for symplecticity should show a defect matrix $D\\Phi^T J D\\Phi - J$ with a norm close to machine precision (plus any error from the finite-difference Jacobian approximation).",
