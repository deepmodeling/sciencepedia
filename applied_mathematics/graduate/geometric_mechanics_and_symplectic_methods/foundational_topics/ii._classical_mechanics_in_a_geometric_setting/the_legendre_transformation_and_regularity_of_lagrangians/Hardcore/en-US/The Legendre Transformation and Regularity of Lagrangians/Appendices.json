Therefore, the Lagrangian $L_{\\lambda}$ is regular if and only if $\\lambda \\neq 0$. Given the constraint $\\lambda \\ge 0$, this implies that $L_{\\lambda}$ is regular for all $\\lambda > 0$.\nThe Lagrangian is singular when $\\lambda=0$. In this case, $\\det W = 0$ for all configurations $q \\in Q$. Regularity fails for the entire system, not just at a specific point. To exhibit a specific configuration-velocity point where regularity fails, we can choose any point in $TQ$ for the case $\\lambda=0$. For instance, at $\\lambda=0$, regularity fails at the point where $q=(q_1,q_2)=(0,1)$ and $v=(v_1,v_2)=(1,0)$. When $\\lambda=0$, the momenta are related by $p_2 = -q_2 p_1$, a primary constraint indicating degeneracy.\n\n### Part 3: Hamiltonian for $\\lambda>0$\n\nFor $\\lambda>0$, the Lagrangian is regular, and the Legendre transformation is a diffeomorphism. We can invert the relations for the momenta to express the velocities $v$ in terms of the phase space coordinates $(q,p)$. The relations are:\n1. $p_{1} = v_{1} - q_{2} v_{2}$\n2. $p_{2} = -q_{2} p_{1} + \\lambda v_{2}$\n\nFrom equation (2), since $\\lambda>0$, we can solve for $v_2$:\n$$\n\\lambda v_{2} = p_{2} + q_{2} p_{1} \\implies v_{2} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}(p_{2} + q_{2} p_{1}).\n$$\nSubstitute this into equation (1) to solve for $v_1$:\n$$\nv_{1} = p_{1} + q_{2} v_{2} = p_{1} + q_{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\lambda}(p_{2} + q_{2} p_{1}) \\right] = p_{1} + \\frac{q_2 p_2 + q_2^2 p_1}{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\lambda p_1 + q_2 p_2 + q_2^2 p_1}{\\lambda}.\n$$\nThe Hamiltonian $H_{\\lambda}(q,p)$ is defined by the Legendre transform:\n$$\nH_{\\lambda}(q,p) = p_{1}v_{1} + p_{2}v_{2} - L_{\\lambda}(q,v),\n$$\nwhere $v$ is eliminated in favor of $p$. The kinetic part of the Lagrangian, $T=\\frac{1}{2}(v_1-q_2 v_2)^2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{2}v_2^2$, is quadratic in velocities and can be written as $T = \\frac{1}{2}v^T W v$. For such Lagrangians, $L = \\frac{1}{2}v^T W v - U$, the Hamiltonian is given by $H = \\frac{1}{2}p^T W^{-1} p + U$. First, we compute the inverse of $W$:\n$$\nW^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det W} \\begin{pmatrix} q_{2}^{2}+\\lambda & q_{2} \\\\ q_{2} & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\begin{pmatrix} q_{2}^{2}+\\lambda & q_{2} \\\\ q_{2} & 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nNow we compute the quadratic form $\\frac{1}{2}p^T W^{-1} p$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} p^T W^{-1} p = \\frac{1}{2\\lambda} \\begin{pmatrix} p_{1} & p_{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} q_{2}^{2}+\\lambda & q_{2} \\\\ q_{2} & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} p_{1} \\\\ p_{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2\\lambda} \\begin{pmatrix} p_{1} & p_{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} (q_{2}^{2}+\\lambda)p_{1} + q_{2}p_{2} \\\\ q_{2}p_{1} + p_{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2\\lambda} \\left[ p_{1}((q_{2}^{2}+\\lambda)p_{1} + q_{2}p_{2}) + p_{2}(q_{2}p_{1} + p_{2}) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2\\lambda} \\left[ (q_{2}^{2}+\\lambda)p_{1}^{2} + q_{2}p_{1}p_{2} + q_{2}p_{1}p_{2} + p_{2}^{2} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2\\lambda} \\left[ (\\lambda+q_{2}^{2})p_{1}^{2} + 2q_{2}p_{1}p_{2} + p_{2}^{2} \\right].\n$$\nThis expression can be simplified by expanding and regrouping terms:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2\\lambda} \\left[ \\lambda p_{1}^{2} + q_{2}^{2}p_{1}^{2} + 2q_{2}p_{1}p_{2} + p_{2}^{2} \\right] = \\frac{\\lambda p_{1}^{2}}{2\\lambda} + \\frac{1}{2\\lambda} \\left[ q_{2}^{2}p_{1}^{2} + 2q_{2}p_{1}p_{2} + p_{2}^{2} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2}p_{1}^{2} + \\frac{1}{2\\lambda} (q_{2}p_{1} + p_{2})^{2}.\n$$\nThe full Hamiltonian is obtained by adding the potential term $U(q)$:\n$$\nH_{\\lambda}(q,p) = \\frac{1}{2}p_{1}^{2} + \\frac{1}{2\\lambda}(q_{2}p_{1} + p_{2})^{2} + U(q).\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the Hamiltonian for $\\lambda > 0$.",

It is a legitimate, non-trivial problem in theoretical mechanics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds by applying the Dirac–Bergmann algorithm.\n\nFirst, we define the canonical momenta $p_i$ via the fiber derivative of the Lagrangian $L$, also known as the Legendre transformation. Let the coordinates be $q = (x,y,z)$ and velocities be $v = (v_x, v_y, v_z)$.\n$$\np_x = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v_x} = m v_x + c z\n$$\n$$\np_y = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v_y} = m v_y\n$$\n$$\np_z = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v_z} = d x\n$$\nWe attempt to express the velocities in terms of the phase space variables $(q, p)$.\nFrom the first two equations, as $m>0$:\n$$\nv_x = \\frac{1}{m}(p_x - c z)\n$$\n$$\nv_y = \\frac{1}{m} p_y\n$$\nThe third equation, $p_z = d x$, does not involve any velocity component. This means it is not possible to solve for $v_z$ in terms of the canonical variables. This equation is therefore a constraint on the phase space, known as a primary constraint.\n$$\n\\phi_1(x, p_z) = p_z - d x \\approx 0\n$$\nThe symbol $\\approx$ denotes a \"weak equality\" that holds on the constraint submanifold of the phase space.\n\nNext, we construct the canonical Hamiltonian $H_c = \\sum_i p_i v_i - L$. The velocity $v_z$ is undetermined, so we treat it as a free parameter for now.\n$$\nH_c = p_x v_x + p_y v_y + p_z v_z - \\left( \\frac{1}{2} m (v_x^2 + v_y^2) + c z v_x + d x v_z \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $v_x$ and $v_y$:\n$$\nH_c = p_x \\left(\\frac{p_x - c z}{m}\\right) + p_y \\left(\\frac{p_y}{m}\\right) + p_z v_z - \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}m \\left( \\left(\\frac{p_x-cz}{m}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{p_y}{m}\\right)^2 \\right) + c z \\left(\\frac{p_x - cz}{m}\\right) + d x v_z \\right]\n$$\nAfter algebraic simplification, this becomes:\n$$\nH_c = \\frac{1}{2m}(p_x - cz)^2 + \\frac{p_y^2}{2m} + (p_z - dx)v_z\n$$\nThe dynamics of the system are governed by the total Hamiltonian $H_T$, which is the canonical Hamiltonian plus all primary constraints multiplied by arbitrary functions of time (Lagrange multipliers).\n$$\nH_T = H_0 + u \\phi_1\n$$\nwhere $H_0 = \\frac{1}{2m}(p_x - cz)^2 + \\frac{p_y^2}{2m}$ is the part of $H_c$ that is defined on the primary constraint surface, and $u$ is a Lagrange multiplier (which can be identified with $v_z$).\n\nFor the system's trajectory to remain on the constraint surface, the primary constraint must be preserved in time. This means its Poisson bracket with the total Hamiltonian must vanish weakly.\n$$\n\\dot{\\phi}_1 = \\{\\phi_1, H_T\\} = \\{\\phi_1, H_0 + u\\phi_1\\} = \\{\\phi_1, H_0\\} + u\\{\\phi_1, \\phi_1\\} \\approx 0\n$$\nSince $\\{\\phi_1, \\phi_1\\} = 0$, we only need to compute $\\{\\phi_1, H_0\\}$. The canonical Poisson bracket is $\\{f, g\\} = \\sum_i (\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q_i}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p_i} - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_i}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial q_i})$.\n$$\n\\{\\phi_1, H_0\\} = \\{p_z - dx, \\frac{1}{2m}(p_x - cz)^2 + \\frac{p_y^2}{2m}\\}\n$$\nThe only non-zero partial derivatives of $\\phi_1 = p_z - dx$ are $\\frac{\\partial \\phi_1}{\\partial x} = -d$ and $\\frac{\\partial \\phi_1}{\\partial p_z} = 1$. The only non-zero partial derivatives of $H_0$ that pair with these are $\\frac{\\partial H_0}{\\partial p_x} = \\frac{1}{m}(p_x-cz)$ and $\\frac{\\partial H_0}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{c}{m}(p_x-cz)$.\n$$\n\\{\\phi_1, H_0\\} = \\frac{\\partial \\phi_1}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial H_0}{\\partial p_x} - \\frac{\\partial \\phi_1}{\\partial p_z}\\frac{\\partial H_0}{\\partial z} = (-d)\\left(\\frac{p_x-cz}{m}\\right) - (1)\\left(-\\frac{c}{m}(p_x-cz)\\right) = \\frac{c-d}{m}(p_x-cz)\n$$\nThe condition $\\dot{\\phi}_1 \\approx 0$ thus implies $\\frac{c-d}{m}(p_x-cz) \\approx 0$. Since we are given $m>0$ and $c \\neq d$, this leads to a secondary constraint:\n$$\n\\phi_2(x, z, p_x) = p_x - cz \\approx 0\n$$\nPer the problem statement, we assume the algorithm closes. We verify this by checking the time preservation of $\\phi_2$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\phi}_2 = \\{\\phi_2, H_T\\} = \\{\\phi_2, H_0\\} + u\\{\\phi_2, \\phi_1\\} \\approx 0\n$$\nFirst, we compute $\\{\\phi_2, H_0\\}$:\n$$\n\\{\\phi_2, H_0\\} = \\{p_x - cz, \\frac{1}{2m}(p_x - cz)^2 + \\frac{p_y^2}{2m}\\} = \\{p_x-cz, \\frac{1}{2m}(p_x-cz)^2\\} = 0\n$$\nNext, we compute $\\{\\phi_2, \\phi_1\\}$:\n$$\n\\{\\phi_2, \\phi_1\\} = \\{p_x - cz, p_z - dx\\} = \\frac{\\partial \\phi_2}{\\partial z}\\frac{\\partial \\phi_1}{\\partial p_z} - \\frac{\\partial \\phi_2}{\\partial p_x}\\frac{\\partial \\phi_1}{\\partial x} = (-c)(1) - (1)(-d) = d-c\n$$\nThe condition $\\dot{\\phi}_2 \\approx 0$ becomes $u(d-c) \\approx 0$. Since $d \\neq c$, this fixes the Lagrange multiplier: $u=0$. No new constraints are generated, and the algorithm terminates.\n\nWe have two constraints, $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$. The problem states they are second-class. We form the constraint matrix $C_{ij} = \\{\\phi_i, \\phi_j\\}$.\n$$\nC_{11} = \\{\\phi_1, \\phi_1\\} = 0\n$$\n$$\nC_{12} = \\{\\phi_1, \\phi_2\\} = -\\{\\phi_2, \\phi_1\\} = -(d-c) = c-d\n$$\n$$\nC_{21} = \\{\\phi_2, \\phi_1\\} = d-c\n$$\n$$\nC_{22} = \\{\\phi_2, \\phi_2\\} = 0\n$$\nThe constraint matrix is $C = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & c-d \\\\ d-c & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Its determinant is $\\det(C) = -(c-d)(d-c) = (c-d)^2$. Since $c \\neq d$, $\\det(C) \\neq 0$, so the matrix is invertible and the constraints are indeed second-class.\nThe inverse matrix is:\n$$\nC^{-1} = \\frac{1}{(c-d)^2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & d-c \\\\ c-d & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\frac{d-c}{(c-d)^2} \\\\ \\frac{c-d}{(c-d)^2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\\frac{1}{c-d} \\\\ \\frac{1}{c-d} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe Dirac bracket of two functions $f$ and $g$ is defined as $\\{f, g\\}_D = \\{f, g\\} - \\sum_{i,j=1,2} \\{f, \\phi_i\\} (C^{-1})_{ij} \\{\\phi_j, g\\}$.

Carry out the Routh reduction at a fixed momentum $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}$ on the open subset where $G$-regularity holds, and eliminate $\\dot{\\phi}$ to obtain a reduced Routhian expressed purely in terms of $(x,y)$ and $(\\dot{x},\\dot{y})$.\n\n3. Analyze, in words based on first principles, how the effective number of degrees of freedom in the reduced dynamics changes near $\\mathcal{S}$ as $\\mu$ varies, and discuss the qualitative mechanism by which the reduced dynamics may undergo a bifurcation near $(x,y)=(0,0)$ owing to the failure of $G$-regularity along $\\mathcal{S}$ and the presence of the nondegenerate minimum of $V$.\n\nYour final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression for the reduced Routhian derived in item 2.

The given Lagrangian $L$ is independent of $\\phi$, so $\\phi$ is a cyclic coordinate. By Noether's theorem, this invariance under translation in $\\phi$ implies the existence of a conserved quantity, the canonical momentum conjugate to $\\phi$. This momentum, denoted $p_{\\phi}$, is defined as:\n$$\np_{\\phi} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\phi}}\n$$\nCalculating this derivative from the given Lagrangian:\n$$\np_{\\phi} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\dot{\\phi}} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} m \\left(\\dot{x}^{2} + \\dot{y}^{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\, \\gamma\\, x^{2} \\left(\\dot{\\phi} + \\alpha \\left(y\\,\\dot{x} - x\\,\\dot{y}\\right)\\right)^{2} - V(x,y) \\right]\n$$\n$$\np_{\\phi} = \\gamma x^{2} \\left(\\dot{\\phi} + \\alpha \\left(y\\,\\dot{x} - x\\,\\dot{y}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThis quantity is conserved along any trajectory of the system, so we set $p_{\\phi} = \\mu$, where $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a constant.\n\nThe group regularity condition (or $G$-regularity condition in the context of a symmetry group $G$, here $G=S^1$) concerns the invertibility of the fiber Legendre transformation, which maps fiber velocities to fiber momenta. Specifically, it requires that we can uniquely solve for the velocity $\\dot{\\phi}$ in terms of the momentum $\\mu$ and the remaining coordinates $(x,y)$ and velocities $(\\dot{x},\\dot{y})$. This is possible if and only if the second derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to the fiber velocity is non-zero. This quantity, $\\frac{\\partial^{2} L}{\\partial \\dot{\\phi}^{2}}$, corresponds to the component of the kinetic energy metric tensor along the fiber direction, also known as the moment of inertia.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} L}{\\partial \\dot{\\phi}^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\dot{\\phi}} \\left( \\gamma x^{2} \\left(\\dot{\\phi} + \\alpha \\left(y\\,\\dot{x} - x\\,\\dot{y}\\right)\\right) \\right) = \\gamma x^{2}\n$$\nSince $\\gamma > 0$ by definition, the $G$-regularity condition is satisfied if and only if $\\gamma x^{2} \\neq 0$, which is equivalent to $x \\neq 0$. The condition fails on the submanifold $\\mathcal{S}=\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\mid x=0\\}$, where the effective moment of inertia for the $\\phi$ rotation vanishes.\n\n### 2. Routh Reduction and the Reduced Routhian\n\nRouth reduction is a procedure to eliminate a cyclic coordinate and obtain a reduced dynamical system on a lower-dimensional space. The Routhian, $R_{\\mu}$, acts as the effective Lagrangian for the reduced system. It is defined as $R_{\\mu} = L - p_{\\phi}\\dot{\\phi}$, evaluated at the constant momentum $p_{\\phi} = \\mu$, and with $\\dot{\\phi}$ expressed in terms of the other variables.\n\nFirst, we solve the momentum conservation equation for $\\dot{\\phi}$, assuming $x \\neq 0$:\n$$\n\\mu = \\gamma x^{2} \\left(\\dot{\\phi} + \\alpha \\left(y\\,\\dot{x} - x\\,\\dot{y}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\mu}{\\gamma x^{2}} = \\dot{\\phi} + \\alpha \\left(y\\,\\dot{x} - x\\,\\dot{y}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{\\phi} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\gamma x^{2}} - \\alpha \\left(y\\,\\dot{x} - x\\,\\dot{y}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we construct the Routhian $R_{\\mu} = L - \\mu \\dot{\\phi}$:\n$$\nR_{\\mu} = \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} m \\left(\\dot{x}^{2} + \\dot{y}^{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\, \\gamma\\, x^{2} \\left(\\dot{\\phi} + \\alpha \\left(y\\,\\dot{x} - x\\,\\dot{y}\\right)\\right)^{2} - V(x,y) \\right] - \\mu \\dot{\\phi}\n$$\nWe can simplify the term involving the squared parenthesis by substituting from the momentum equation: $\\dot{\\phi} + \\alpha \\left(y\\,\\dot{x} - x\\,\\dot{y}\\right) = \\frac{\\mu}{\\gamma x^{2}}$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\, \\gamma\\, x^{2} \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\gamma x^{2}}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\, \\gamma\\, x^{2} \\frac{\\mu^{2}}{\\gamma^{2} x^{4}} = \\frac{\\mu^{2}}{2\\gamma x^{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $R_{\\mu}$:\n$$\nR_{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{2} m \\left(\\dot{x}^{2} + \\dot{y}^{2}\\right) + \\frac{\\mu^{2}}{2\\gamma x^{2}} - V(x,y) - \\mu \\dot{\\phi}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $\\dot{\\phi}$:\n$$\nR_{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{2} m \\left(\\dot{x}^{2} + \\dot{y}^{2}\\right) + \\frac{\\mu^{2}}{2\\gamma x^{2}} - V(x,y) - \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\mu}{\\gamma x^{2}} - \\alpha \\left(y\\,\\dot{x} - x\\,\\dot{y}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nExpanding and collecting terms:\n$$\nR_{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{2} m \\left(\\dot{x}^{2} + \\dot{y}^{2}\\right) + \\frac{\\mu^{2}}{2\\gamma x^{2}} - \\frac{\\mu^{2}}{\\gamma x^{2}} - V(x,y) + \\mu\\alpha \\left(y\\,\\dot{x} - x\\,\\dot{y}\\right)\n$$\nThe reduced Routhian expressed purely in terms of $(x,y)$ and $(\\dot{x},\\dot{y})$ is:\n$$\nR_{\\mu}(x,y,\\dot{x},\\dot{y}) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\left(\\dot{x}^{2} + \\dot{y}^{2}\\right) + \\mu\\alpha \\left(y\\,\\dot{x} - x\\,\\dot{y}\\right) - V(x,y) - \\frac{\\mu^{2}}{2\\gamma x^{2}}\n$$\n\n### 3. Analysis of Reduced Dynamics and Bifurcation\n\nThe Routhian has the structure of a Lagrangian for a particle of mass $m$ in a $2$-dimensional configuration space with coordinates $(x,y)$. The system has $2$ degrees of freedom as long as the reduction is regular ($x \\neq 0$). The motion is governed by an effective potential and additional velocity-dependent forces.\nThe Routhian can be written as $R_{\\mu} = T_{red} + A_{\\mu} - V_{eff}$, where:\n- $T_{red} = \\frac{1}{2} m \\left(\\dot{x}^{2} + \\dot{y}^{2}\\right)$ is the reduced kinetic energy.\n- $A_{\\mu} = \\mu\\alpha \\left(y\\,\\dot{x} - x\\,\\dot{y}\\right)$ is a magnetic or gyroscopic term. It generates a force proportional to velocity and perpendicular to it, similar to the Lorentz force from a magnetic field.\n- $V_{eff} = V(x,y) + \\frac{\\mu^{2}}{2\\gamma x^{2}}$ is the effective potential. The second term, $V_{cent} = \\frac{\\mu^{2}}{2\\gamma x^{2}}$, is known as the centrifugal potential, which arises from the inertia of the cyclic motion.\n\nThe effective number of degrees of freedom is $2$ wherever the Routhian is well-defined, i.e., for $x \\neq 0$. The behavior near the submanifold $\\mathcal{S}$ (where $x=0$) depends critically on the value of the momentum $\\mu$.\n\n- **For $\\mu \\neq 0$**: The centrifugal potential $V_{cent}$ creates an infinite potential barrier along the line $x=0$. This barrier effectively confines the dynamics to one of the two half-planes, either $x > 0$ or $x < 0$, preventing the system from ever reaching the submanifold $\\mathcal{S}$ where G-regularity fails. The system remains strictly a $2$-DOF system on a restricted domain.\n\n- **For $\\mu = 0$**: The centrifugal potential and the gyroscopic term both vanish. The Routhian simplifies to $R_{0} = \\frac{1}{2} m \\left(\\dot{x}^{2} + \\dot{y}^{2}\\right) - V(x,y)$. The reduced dynamics are simply those of a particle moving in the original potential $V(x,y)$. The system can now access the line $x = 0$. On this line, the original problem is singular, but in the reduced picture for $\\mu=0$, the dynamics are perfectly regular.\n\nThis change in the structure of the effective potential as $\\mu$ varies leads to a bifurcation in the equilibrium structure of the reduced system near the origin $(0,0)$.\n\n- The potential $V(x,y)$ has a non-degenerate minimum at $(0,0)$. For $\\mu=0$, $V_{eff} = V(x,y)$, so the reduced system has a stable equilibrium at $(0,0)$.\n\n- For $\\mu \\neq 0$, the equilibrium points are found by setting the gradient of the effective potential to zero: $\\nabla V_{eff} = 0$.\n  $$\n  \\frac{\\partial V_{eff}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\mu^{2}}{\\gamma x^{3}} = 0\n  $$\n  $$\n  \\frac{\\partial V_{eff}}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} = 0\n  $$\n  The origin $(0,0)$ is no longer a solution because of the singular term $\\frac{\\mu^{2}}{\\gamma x^{3}}$. The original stable equilibrium at the origin is destroyed by the centrifugal force for any non-zero momentum $\\mu$. The confining nature of $V$ (which pulls the system toward the origin) and the repulsive nature of $V_{cent}$ (which pushes the system away from the $y$-axis) compete. This competition results in new equilibrium positions away from the $y$-axis. Near the origin, where $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} \\approx k_{xx} x$ for some constant $k_{xx} > 0$, the first equation becomes $k_{xx} x \\approx \\frac{\\mu^{2}}{\\gamma x^{3}}$, leading to solutions for $x_{eq}$ where $x_{eq}^4 \\propto \\mu^2$. This shows that for any infinitesimally small but non-zero $\\mu$, the equilibrium at $x=0$ splits into two new equilibria at $x \\neq 0$. This is a pitchfork bifurcation. The qualitative change in the system's phase portrait is driven by the singular nature of the reduction, where the vanishing of the moment of inertia at $x=0$ generates an infinitely strong centrifugal repulsion for any non-zero angular momentum.",
