Differential geometry provides the precise language for this translation. This first practice  grounds the abstract concept of mass conservation in the geometric operations of pushforward and pullback, allowing you to derive the evolution of a density field from first principles.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded within the established mathematical framework of differential geometry and geometric mechanics, well-posed, and objective. All terms are standard and the tasks are unambiguous. No inconsistencies, contradictions, or missing information are present.\n\nWe begin by deriving the expression for the time-dependent density $\\rho(t,x)$. The evolution of the mass measure is given by the pushforward, $\\varphi_{t*}(\\rho_{0} \\mu)$, and we are given that this equals $\\rho(t) \\mu$. The definition of the pushforward of a measure requires that for any smooth test function $f \\in C^{\\infty}_{c}(\\mathcal{M})$ (smooth functions with compact support), the following equality holds:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathcal{M}} f \\, (\\varphi_{t*}(\\rho_{0} \\mu)) = \\int_{\\mathcal{M}} (f \\circ \\varphi_{t}) \\, (\\rho_{0} \\mu)\n$$\nBy substituting the given expressions for the measures, where the densities are with respect to the volume form $\\mu$, we can write this as an integral identity. Let $x$ be a point in the codomain of the integration on the left, and $y$ be a point in the domain of the integration on the right.\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathcal{M}} f(x) \\rho(t, x) \\mu(x) = \\int_{\\mathcal{M}} f(\\varphi_{t}(y)) \\rho_{0}(y) \\mu(y)\n$$\nThis identity is the starting point of our derivation. It relates the density at time $t$ to the initial density at time $t=0$. To find an explicit expression for $\\rho(t,x)$, we must manipulate this equation so that $\\rho(t,x)$ can be isolated. We perform a change of variables in the left-hand side integral. Let $x = \\varphi_{t}(y)$, which is a valid change of variables since $\\varphi_t$ is a diffeomorphism for each $t$. The inverse transformation is $y = \\varphi_{t}^{-1}(x)$.\nUnder this change of variables, the function $f(x)$ becomes $f(\\varphi_{t}(y))$, the function $\\rho(t,x)$ becomes $\\rho(t, \\varphi_{t}(y))$, and the volume form $\\mu(x)$ transforms via pullback to $\\varphi_{t}^{*}\\mu(y)$.\nThe integral on the left-hand side becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathcal{M}} f(x) \\rho(t, x) \\mu(x) = \\int_{\\mathcal{M}} f(\\varphi_{t}(y)) \\rho(t, \\varphi_{t}(y)) \\, (\\varphi_{t}^{*}\\mu)(y)\n$$\nThe problem defines the Jacobian $J_{t}$ by the relation $\\varphi_{t}^{*}\\mu = J_{t}\\,\\mu$. Substituting this into the transformed integral gives:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathcal{M}} f(\\varphi_{t}(y)) \\rho(t, \\varphi_{t}(y)) J_{t}(y) \\mu(y)\n$$\nNow, we equate this with the right-hand side of our original integral identity:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathcal{M}} f(\\varphi_{t}(y)) \\rho(t, \\varphi_{t}(y)) J_{t}(y) \\mu(y) = \\int_{\\mathcal{M}} f(\\varphi_{t}(y)) \\rho_{0}(y) \\mu(y)\n$$\nLet $g(y) = f(\\varphi_{t}(y))$. Since $\\varphi_t$ is a diffeomorphism, as $f$ ranges over all smooth functions with compact support, $g$ also covers a sufficiently large set of test functions. The identity can be written as:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathcal{M}} g(y) \\left[ \\rho(t, \\varphi_{t}(y)) J_{t}(y) - \\rho_{0}(y) \\right] \\mu(y) = 0\n$$\nBy the fundamental lemma of calculus of variations, if this integral is zero for all such test functions $g$, the term in the square brackets must be identically zero.\n$$\n\\rho(t, \\varphi_{t}(y)) J_{t}(y) - \\rho_{0}(y) = 0\n$$\nThis gives us a relationship often referred to as the law of mass conservation in the Lagrangian picture:\n$$\n\\rho(t, \\varphi_{t}(y)) J_{t}(y) = \\rho_{0}(y)\n$$\nThe problem asks for an expression for $\\rho(t,x)$. To obtain this, we set $x = \\varphi_{t}(y)$, which implies $y = \\varphi_{t}^{-1}(x)$. We substitute $y = \\varphi_{t}^{-1}(x)$ into the equation above:\n$$\n\\rho(t, \\varphi_{t}(\\varphi_{t}^{-1}(x))) J_{t}(\\varphi_{t}^{-1}(x)) = \\rho_{0}(\\varphi_{t}^{-1}(x))\n$$\nSimplifying the composition $\\varphi_{t} \\circ \\varphi_{t}^{-1}$ to the identity map gives:\n$$\n\\rho(t, x) J_{t}(\\varphi_{t}^{-1}(x)) = \\rho_{0}(\\varphi_{t}^{-1}(x))\n$$\nSolving for $\\rho(t,x)$ yields the desired explicit expression:\n$$\n\\rho(t,x) = \\frac{\\rho_{0}(\\varphi_{t}^{-1}(x))}{J_{t}(\\varphi_{t}^{-1}(x))}\n$$\n\nNext, we specialize to the setting of geometric continuum mechanics on a symplectic manifold. Here, $(\\mathcal{M}, \\omega)$ is a $2n$-dimensional symplectic manifold and the volume form is the canonical symplectic volume form $\\mu = \\frac{\\omega^{n}}{n!}$. Incompressibility is the physical property of a flow preserving volume. For a flow $\\varphi_{t}$, this means that for any domain $U \\subset \\mathcal{M}$, the volume of $U$ is equal to the volume of its image under the flow, $\\varphi_{t}(U)$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Vol}(U) = \\mathrm{Vol}(\\varphi_{t}(U)) \\implies \\int_{U} \\mu = \\int_{\\varphi_{t}(U)} \\mu\n$$\nBy the change of variables formula, $\\int_{\\varphi_{t}(U)} \\mu = \\int_{U} \\varphi_{t}^{*}\\mu$. Thus, the condition for incompressibility is:\n$$\n\\int_{U} \\mu = \\int_{U} \\varphi_{t}^{*}\\mu\n$$\nSince this must hold for any arbitrary domain $U$, the integrands must be equal: $\\varphi_{t}^{*}\\mu = \\mu$. In terms of the Jacobian $J_{t}$ defined by $\\varphi_{t}^{*}\\mu = J_{t}\\mu$, incompressibility is equivalent to the condition $J_{t}(x) = 1$ for all $x \\in \\mathcal{M}$ and all $t$.\n\nFor Hamiltonian flows, the generating vector field $X_t$ is derived from a time-dependent Hamiltonian function $H_t$ via the relation $i_{X_{t}}\\omega = -dH_{t}$, where $i_{X_t}$ denotes the interior product. To show that the flow $\\varphi_t$ of $X_t$ is incompressible, we must show that $\\varphi_t^* \\mu = \\mu$. This is equivalent to showing that the Lie derivative of the volume form $\\mu$ with respect to the generating vector field $X_t$ is zero, i.e., $\\mathcal{L}_{X_t} \\mu = 0$.\nThe Lie derivative acts as a derivation on the algebra of differential forms. Given $\\mu = \\frac{1}{n!}\\omega^n$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\mu = \\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\left(\\frac{\\omega^{n}}{n!}\\right) = \\frac{1}{n!} \\cdot n (\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\omega) \\wedge \\omega^{n-1} = \\frac{1}{(n-1)!} (\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\omega) \\wedge \\omega^{n-1}\n$$\nWe use Cartan's magic formula, $\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\omega = d(i_{X_{t}}\\omega) + i_{X_{t}}(d\\omega)$. By definition, a symplectic form $\\omega$ is closed, so $d\\omega=0$. This simplifies the formula to $\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\omega = d(i_{X_{t}}\\omega)$.\nSince $X_t$ is a Hamiltonian vector field, we have $i_{X_{t}}\\omega = -dH_{t}$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\omega = d(-dH_{t}) = -d(dH_{t})\n$$\nThe property $d \\circ d = 0$ (the exterior derivative of an exact form is zero) implies $d(dH_{t})=0$. Thus, $\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\omega = 0$.\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the Lie derivative of $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\mu = \\frac{1}{(n-1)!} (0) \\wedge \\omega^{n-1} = 0\n$$\nSince $\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\mu = 0$, the flow $\\varphi_t$ generated by $X_t$ preserves the volume form $\\mu$. This result is a statement of Liouville's theorem in Hamiltonian mechanics. Hence, for any Hamiltonian flow, $\\varphi_{t}^{*}\\mu = \\mu$, which means $J_{t} \\equiv 1$ and the flow is incompressible. For such a flow, the density evolution simplifies to $\\rho(t,x) = \\rho_{0}(\\varphi_{t}^{-1}(x))$.\n\nThe final answer required is the general expression derived in the first part, valid for any oriented manifold with a volume form and diffeomorphism.",

The KKS form on the coadjoint orbit through $m \\in \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$ is defined for two elements $X_f, X_g \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ as:\n$$\n\\Omega_{m}(X_{f},X_{g}) = \\langle m, [X_{f},X_{g}] \\rangle\n$$\nUsing the provided definition of the pairing, $\\langle m, X \\rangle = \\int_{M} m(X)\\,\\mu$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\Omega_{m}(X_{f},X_{g}) = \\int_{M} m([X_{f},X_{g}])\\,\\mu\n$$\nwhere $[X_{f},X_{g}]$ is the Lie bracket (commutator) of the vector fields.\n\nTo proceed, we use an identity for the Lie derivative of a $1$-form. For a $1$-form $\\alpha$ and vector fields $X, Y$, the Lie derivative $\\mathcal{L}_{X}\\alpha$ is given by $(\\mathcal{L}_{X}\\alpha)(Y) = X(\\alpha(Y)) - \\alpha([X,Y])$. Rearranging this gives:\n$$\n\\alpha([X,Y]) = X(\\alpha(Y)) - (\\mathcal{L}_{X}\\alpha)(Y)\n$$\nApplying this to our case with $\\alpha=m$, $X=X_f$, and $Y=X_g$:\n$$\nm([X_f, X_g]) = X_f(m(X_g)) - (\\mathcal{L}_{X_f}m)(X_g)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the integral for $\\Omega_m$:\n$$\n\\Omega_{m}(X_{f},X_{g}) = \\int_{M} \\left( X_f(m(X_g)) - (\\mathcal{L}_{X_f}m)(X_g) \\right)\\,\\mu\n$$\nLet's analyze the first term in the integrand, $\\int_{M} X_f(m(X_g))\\,\\mu$. The expression $X_f(m(X_g))$ is the Lie derivative of the scalar function $m(X_g)$ along the vector field $X_f$, i.e., $\\mathcal{L}_{X_f}(m(X_g))$. Since $X_f$ is an element of the Lie algebra of area-preserving diffeomorphisms, it is divergence-free, which means $\\mathcal{L}_{X_f}\\mu = 0$. This allows us to write:\n$$\n\\int_{M} \\mathcal{L}_{X_f}(m(X_g))\\,\\mu = \\int_{M} \\mathcal{L}_{X_f}(m(X_g)\\,\\mu)\n$$\nFor any vector field $Y$, the Lie derivative of a top-form $\\alpha$ on a manifold $M$ can be written as $\\mathcal{L}_{Y}\\alpha = d(i_{Y}\\alpha)$ (since $d\\alpha=0$). As $m(X_g)\\mu$ is a $2$-form on a $2$-dimensional manifold $M$, it is a top-form. Therefore, by Stokes' theorem, its integral over the compact, boundaryless manifold $M$ is zero:\n$$\n\\int_{M} \\mathcal{L}_{X_f}(m(X_g)\\,\\mu) = \\int_{M} d(i_{X_f}(m(X_g)\\,\\mu)) = \\int_{\\partial M} i_{X_f}(m(X_g)\\,\\mu) = 0\n$$\nThus, the KKS form simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Omega_{m}(X_{f},X_{g}) = - \\int_{M} (\\mathcal{L}_{X_f}m)(X_g)\\,\\mu\n$$\nNow, we use Cartan's magic formula for the Lie derivative of a form: $\\mathcal{L}_{X}\\alpha = i_{X}d\\alpha + d(i_{X}\\alpha)$. Applying this to the $1$-form $m$:\n$$\n(\\mathcal{L}_{X_f}m)(X_g) = (i_{X_f}dm)(X_g) + (d(i_{X_f}m))(X_g)\n$$\nBy definition, $(i_{X_f}dm)(X_g) = dm(X_f, X_g)$. For the second term, $i_{X_f}m$ is the scalar function $m(X_f)$, and for any scalar function $h$, $(dh)(Y) = Y(h)$. So, $(d(m(X_f)))(X_g) = X_g(m(X_f))$. The KKS form becomes:\n$$\n\\Omega_{m}(X_{f},X_{g}) = - \\int_{M} \\left( dm(X_f, X_g) + X_g(m(X_f)) \\right)\\,\\mu\n$$\nThe second term in this integral, $\\int_M X_g(m(X_f))\\,\\mu$, vanishes for the same reason as before (it is the integral of a Lie derivative over a compact boundaryless manifold). We are left with:\n$$\n\\Omega_{m}(X_{f},X_{g}) = - \\int_{M} dm(X_f, X_g)\\,\\mu\n$$\nWe are given the relations $dm = \\omega\\mu$ and $i_{X_f}\\mu = df$. The term $dm(X_f, X_g)$ is the evaluation of the $2$-form $dm$ on the vector fields $X_f$ and $X_g$. Substituting $dm = \\omega\\mu$, we get:\n$$\ndm(X_f, X_g) = \\omega \\cdot \\mu(X_f, X_g)\n$$\nThe evaluation of the area form $\\mu(X_f,X_g)$ can be related to the stream functions using the interior product definition:\n$$\n\\mu(X_f, X_g) = i_{X_g}(i_{X_f}\\mu) = i_{X_g}(df) = df(X_g) = X_g(f)\n$$\nThe problem defines the Poisson bracket $\\{f,g\\}$ via $[X_f, X_g] = X_{\\{f,g\\}}$. It is a standard result in this context that this bracket corresponds to $\\{f,g\\} = X_f(g)$. Since $\\mu(X_f, X_g) = -\\mu(X_g, X_f)$, we have $X_g(f) = -X_f(g) = -\\{f,g\\}$.\nTherefore, $\\mu(X_f, X_g) = -\\{f,g\\}$.\nCombining these results, we find $dm(X_f, X_g) = -\\omega\\{f,g\\}$. Substituting this back into our expression for $\\Omega_m$:\n$$\n\\Omega_{m}(X_{f},X_{g}) = - \\int_{M} (-\\omega\\{f,g\\})\\,\\mu = \\int_{M} \\omega\\{f,g\\}\\,\\mu\n$$\nThis is the desired general integral expression. This formula reveals that the symplectic geometry of the coadjoint orbit is determined by the interaction between the vorticity $\\omega$ (which characterizes the orbit) and the Poisson bracket of stream functions $\\{f,g\\}$ (which represents the non-commutativity of the infinitesimal area-preserving flows).\n\nNext, we specialize to the given case on the two-torus $M=\\mathbb{T}^2$. The area form is $\\mu = d\\theta \\wedge d\\phi$. The stream functions are $f(\\theta,\\phi) = \\cos\\theta + \\cos\\phi$ and $g(\\theta,\\phi) = \\sin\\theta + \\sin\\phi$. We must first compute the Poisson bracket $\\{f,g\\}$.\nWith $\\mu = d\\theta \\wedge d\\phi$, the condition $i_{X_h}\\mu = dh$ implies that the Hamiltonian vector field is $X_h = \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial\\phi}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta} - \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial\\theta}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\phi}$.\nThe Poisson bracket is then $\\{f,g\\} = X_f(g)$:\n$$\n\\{f,g\\} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\phi}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\theta} - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\phi}\n$$\nWe compute the partial derivatives:\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta} = -\\sin\\theta$\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\phi} = -\\sin\\phi$\n$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\theta} = \\cos\\theta$\n$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\phi} = \\cos\\phi$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for the bracket:\n$$\n\\{f,g\\} = (-\\sin\\phi)(\\cos\\theta) - (-\\sin\\theta)(\\cos\\phi) = \\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi - \\cos\\theta\\sin\\phi = \\sin(\\theta - \\phi)\n$$\nNow we compute the integral for $\\Omega_m(X_f, X_g)$, using the given vorticity $\\omega(\\theta,\\phi) = 1 + \\beta\\,\\sin(\\phi - \\theta) = 1 - \\beta\\,\\sin(\\theta - \\phi)$:\n$$\n\\Omega_{m}(X_{f},X_{g}) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\omega(\\theta, \\phi)\\{f,g\\}(\\theta,\\phi) \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi\n$$\n$$\n= \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} (1 - \\beta\\,\\sin(\\theta - \\phi)) \\sin(\\theta - \\phi) \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi\n$$\n$$\n= \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\left( \\sin(\\theta - \\phi) - \\beta\\,\\sin^{2}(\\theta - \\phi) \\right) d\\theta \\, d\\phi\n$$\nWe evaluate the integral in two parts.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the sectional curvature $K(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v})$ of the infinite-dimensional Lie group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of the $2$-torus, $\\mathrm{Diff}_{\\mathrm{vol}}(T^{2})$, equipped with the right-invariant $L^{2}$ metric. The curvature is to be computed at the identity element in the $2$-plane spanned by the divergence-free vector fields $\\mathbf{u}(x,y) = \\sin(y)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{x}$ and $\\mathbf{v}(x,y) = \\sin(x)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{y}$.\n\nThe Lie algebra of $\\mathrm{Diff}_{\\mathrm{vol}}(T^{2})$ is the space of divergence-free vector fields on the torus, $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{X}_{\\mathrm{div}}(T^2)$. The $L^2$ inner product on $\\mathfrak{g}$ is given by $\\langle \\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b} \\rangle = \\int_{T^{2}} \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} \\, dV$, where $dV = dx \\, dy$. The domain of integration is $[0, 2\\pi] \\times [0, 2\\pi]$.\n\nFirst, we compute the norms of $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ and their inner product.\n$$\n\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|^2 = \\langle \\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{u} \\rangle = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} (\\sin(y))^2 \\, dx \\, dy = 2\\pi \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sin^2(y) \\, dy = 2\\pi \\left[\\frac{y}{2} - \\frac{\\sin(2y)}{4}\\right]_0^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi^2.\n$$\n$$\n\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|^2 = \\langle \\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{v} \\rangle = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} (\\sin(x))^2 \\, dx \\, dy = 2\\pi \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sin^2(x) \\, dx = 2\\pi^2.\n$$\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v} \\rangle = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} (\\sin(y)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{x}) \\cdot (\\sin(x)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{y}) \\, dx \\, dy = \\int_{T^2} 0 \\, dV = 0.\n$$\nSince $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ are orthogonal, the formula for the sectional curvature $K(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v})$ simplifies to:\n$$\nK(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v}) = \\frac{\\langle R(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v})\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{u} \\rangle}{\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|^2 \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|^2},\n$$\nwhere $R(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v})\\mathbf{v}$ is the Riemannian curvature tensor acting on the vectors $\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathfrak{g}$.\n\nThe curvature tensor for a right-invariant metric on a Lie group $G$ is given at the identity by the formula\n$$\nR(\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b})\\mathbf{c} = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{a}} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{b}} \\mathbf{c} - \\nabla_{\\mathbf{b}} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{a}} \\mathbf{c} - \\nabla_{[\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b}]} \\mathbf{c}\n$$\nfor $\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b}, \\mathbf{c} \\in \\mathfrak{g} = T_e G$. For the specific case of $\\mathrm{Diff}_{\\mathrm{vol}}(M)$, the Levi-Civita connection at the identity, as established by Arnold, is given by the operator $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{a}}\\mathbf{b} = P((\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{b})$, where $P$ is the Leray-Hodge projection onto the space of divergence-free vector fields. The term $(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{b}$ represents the standard covariant derivative on the flat torus $T^2$.\n\nWe need to compute $\\langle R(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v})\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{u} \\rangle = \\langle \\nabla_{\\mathbf{u}} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{v}} \\mathbf{v} - \\nabla_{\\mathbf{v}} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{u}} \\mathbf{v} - \\nabla_{[\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v}]} \\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{u} \\rangle$. Let's analyze each term.\n\nTerm 1: $\\langle \\nabla_{\\mathbf{u}} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{v}} \\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{u} \\rangle$.\nWe first compute $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{v}}\\mathbf{v} = P((\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{v})$.\n$$\n(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{v} = \\left(\\sin(x)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{y} \\cdot \\nabla\\right) (\\sin(x)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{y}) = \\sin(x) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\sin(x)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{y}) = 0.\n$$\nSince the argument is zero, its projection is zero: $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{v}}\\mathbf{v} = P(0) = 0$. Consequently, $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{u}} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{v}} \\mathbf{v} = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{u}}(0) = 0$. A similar calculation shows that $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{u}}\\mathbf{u} = 0$. This means that the flows generated by $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ are geodesics on the group $\\mathrm{Diff}_{\\mathrm{vol}}(T^{2})$. The first term in the curvature expression vanishes.\n\nTerm 3: $\\langle -\\nabla_{[\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v}]} \\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{u} \\rangle$.\nFirst, we find the Lie bracket $[\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v}] = (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{v} - (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u}$.\n$$\n(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{v} = (\\sin(y)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{x} \\cdot \\nabla)(\\sin(x)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{y}) = \\sin(y)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\sin(x)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{y}) = \\sin(y)\\cos(x)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{y}.\n$$\n$$\n(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u} = (\\sin(x)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{y} \\cdot \\nabla)(\\sin(y)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{x}) = \\sin(x)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\sin(y)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{x}) = \\sin(x)\\cos(y)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{x}.\n$$\nSo, $[\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v}] = \\sin(y)\\cos(x)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{y} - \\sin(x)\\cos(y)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{x}$. Let $\\mathbf{Z} = [\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v}]$.\nNow we compute $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{Z}}\\mathbf{v} = P((\\mathbf{Z} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{v})$.\n$$\n(\\mathbf{Z} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{v} = \\left(-\\sin(x)\\cos(y)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + \\sin(y)\\cos(x)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right)(\\sin(x)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{y}) = -\\sin(x)\\cos(y)\\cos(x)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{y}.\n$$\nLet $\\mathbf{C} = -\\sin(x)\\cos(x)\\cos(y)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{y}$. Then $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{Z}}\\mathbf{v} = P(\\mathbf{C})$. The inner product is then $\\langle P(\\mathbf{C}), \\mathbf{u} \\rangle$. Since the Leray projection $P$ is an orthogonal projection and the vector field $\\mathbf{u}$ is divergence-free (i.e., in the target space of $P$), we have $\\langle P(\\mathbf{C}), \\mathbf{u} \\rangle = \\langle \\mathbf{C}, \\mathbf{u} \\rangle$.\n$$\n\\langle\\mathbf{C}, \\mathbf{u} \\rangle = \\int_{T^2} \\left(-\\sin(x)\\cos(x)\\cos(y)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{y}\\right) \\cdot (\\sin(y)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{x}) \\, dV = \\int_{T^2} 0 \\, dV = 0.\n$$\nThus, the third term also vanishes.\n\nTerm 2: $\\langle -\\nabla_{\\mathbf{v}} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{u}} \\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{u} \\rangle$.\nThis is the only non-vanishing term. First, $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{u}}\\mathbf{v} = P((\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{v})$. We found $(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{v} = \\sin(y)\\cos(x)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{y}$. Let $\\mathbf{A} = \\sin(y)\\cos(x)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{y}$. This field is not divergence-free: $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\sin(y)\\cos(x)) = \\cos(y)\\cos(x)$.\nTo find $P(\\mathbf{A}) = \\mathbf{A} - \\nabla p$, we must solve $\\nabla^2 p = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A} = \\cos(x)\\cos(y)$. A solution is $p(x,y) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\cos(x)\\cos(y)$.\nThe gradient is $\\nabla p = (\\frac{1}{2}\\sin(x)\\cos(y), \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(x)\\sin(y))$.\nSo, $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{u}}\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{A} - \\nabla p = (0, \\sin(y)\\cos(x)) - (\\frac{1}{2}\\sin(x)\\cos(y), \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(x)\\sin(y))$.\nLet $\\mathbf{W} = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{u}}\\mathbf{v} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\sin(x)\\cos(y)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{x} + \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(x)\\sin(y)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{y}$.\n\nNext, we compute $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{v}}\\mathbf{W} = P((\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{W})$.\n$$\n(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{W} = \\sin(x) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\sin(x)\\cos(y)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{x} + \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(x)\\sin(y)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{y}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n= \\sin(x) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sin(x)\\sin(y)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{x} + \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(x)\\cos(y)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{y}\\right).\n$$\nLet this be $\\mathbf{B} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sin^2(x)\\sin(y)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{x} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(x)\\cos(x)\\cos(y)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{y}$. We need the inner product $\\langle -\\nabla_{\\mathbf{v}}\\mathbf{W}, \\mathbf{u} \\rangle = -\\langle P(\\mathbf{B}), \\mathbf{u} \\rangle = -\\langle \\mathbf{B}, \\mathbf{u} \\rangle$.\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbf{B}, \\mathbf{u} \\rangle = \\int_{T^2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sin^2(x)\\sin(y)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{x} + \\dots \\right) \\cdot (\\sin(y)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{x}) \\, dV\n$$\n$$\n= \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{1}{2}\\sin^2(x)\\sin^2(y) \\, dx \\, dy = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sin^2(x)dx\\right) \\left(\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sin^2(y)dy\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\pi)(\\pi) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{2}.\n$$\nPutting it all together, $\\langle R(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v})\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{u} \\rangle = 0 - \\langle \\mathbf{B}, \\mathbf{u} \\rangle - 0 = -\\frac{\\pi^2}{2}$.\n\nFinally, the sectional curvature is:\n$$\nK(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v}) = \\frac{-\\pi^2/2}{\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|^2 \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|^2} = \\frac{-\\pi^2/2}{(2\\pi^2)(2\\pi^2)} = \\frac{-\\pi^2/2}{4\\pi^4} = -\\frac{1}{8\\pi^2}.\n$$\n\nThe symmetry structure of the problem, namely that the dynamics unfolds on the Lie group $\\mathrm{Diff}_{\\mathrm{vol}}(T^{2})$, is fundamental. This group action represents the Lagrangian relabeling symmetry of the fluid. The incompressible Euler equation is not just a PDE, but the geodesic equation on this group. This geometric perspective recasts the problem of fluid dynamics into the language of differential geometry. The Hamiltonian structure arises from this: the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ (divergence-free vector fields) is isomorphic to the algebra of stream functions with the Poisson bracket, and the dual space $\\mathfrak{g}^*$ (vorticities) carries a natural Lie-Poisson structure. The Euler equation in vorticity form, $\\partial_t \\omega + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\omega = 0$, is a Hamiltonian equation on the coadjoint orbits of this group, which are the symplectic leaves of the Poisson manifold $\\mathfrak{g}^*$. The curvature calculation is a direct probe of this geometric structure.\n\nThe sign of the sectional curvature determines the stability of the flow through the Jacobi equation for geodesic deviation, $\\frac{D^2 \\mathbf{J}}{dt^2} + R(\\mathbf{J}, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = 0$. A positive curvature implies that nearby geodesics tend to converge (oscillatory solutions to the Jacobi equation), indicating stability. A negative curvature implies that nearby geodesics diverge exponentially, indicating instability. In our case, $K(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v}) = -1/(8\\pi^2) < 0$. This negative sign implies that a fluid flow starting with velocity field $\\mathbf{u}$ and another starting with a nearby field $\\mathbf{u} + \\epsilon\\mathbf{v}$ will diverge from each other at an exponential rate. From the Lagrangian perspective of fluid particle paths, this corresponds to hydrodynamic instability. The subspace of shear flows spanned by $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ is therefore unstable to perturbations.",
