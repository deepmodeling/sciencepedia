In sub-Riemannian geometry, this question is particularly fascinating because our instantaneous velocity is restricted to a distribution $\\Delta$ that does not span the full tangent space. This practice  delves into the mechanism of controllability, where Lie brackets of the allowed vector fields generate motion in \"forbidden\" directions. You will apply this principle by computing the growth vector, a sequence of numbers that precisely tracks how successfully these new directions are generated at each step.",

            "solution": "The first part of the problem requires the definition of the growth vector of a distribution $\\Delta$ at a point $p$. This definition is based on the concept of the derived flag of the distribution.\n\nLet $\\Delta$ be a smooth distribution of rank $k$ on a smooth manifold $M$. We define a sequence of nested distributions, known as the derived flag or Chow-Rashevsky filtration, as follows. Let $\\Gamma(\\Delta)$ denote the space of smooth vector fields belonging to the distribution $\\Delta$.\nWe define the first element of the flag as the distribution itself:\n$$\n\\Delta^1 = \\Delta\n$$\nSubsequent elements are defined recursively. For $i \\ge 1$, we define $\\Delta^{i+1}$ as the distribution spanned by $\\Delta^i$ and all Lie brackets of vector fields from $\\Delta$ with vector fields from $\\Delta^i$. That is,\n$$\n\\Delta^{i+1} = \\Delta^i + [\\Delta, \\Delta^i]\n$$\nwhere $[\\Delta, \\Delta^i]$ is the distribution spanned by all vector fields of the form $[X, Y]$ where $X \\in \\Gamma(\\Delta)$ and $Y \\in \\Gamma(\\Delta^i)$. This creates a non-decreasing sequence of distributions:\n$$\n\\Delta^1 \\subseteq \\Delta^2 \\subseteq \\Delta^3 \\subseteq \\dots \\subseteq TM\n$$\nAt any given point $p \\in M$, this filtration of distributions induces a filtration of subspaces of the tangent space $T_pM$:\n$$\n\\Delta_p^1 \\subseteq \\Delta_p^2 \\subseteq \\Delta_p^3 \\subseteq \\dots \\subseteq T_pM\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta_p^i$ is the subspace of $T_pM$ obtained by evaluating all vector fields in $\\Gamma(\\Delta^i)$ at the point $p$. Since $T_pM$ is a finite-dimensional vector space, this sequence of subspaces must stabilize. That is, there exists an integer $r$ (called the degree of nonholonomy at $p$) such that $\\Delta_p^r = \\Delta_p^{r+j}$ for all $j \\ge 1$.\n\nThe growth vector of the distribution $\\Delta$ at the point $p$ is the sequence of the dimensions of these subspaces, up to the point of stabilization. Specifically, it is the vector:\n$$\n( \\dim(\\Delta_p^1), \\dim(\\Delta_p^2), \\dots, \\dim(\\Delta_p^r) )\n$$\n\nNow, we apply this definition to the specific problem. We are given the manifold $M=\\mathbb{R}^3$ with global coordinates $(x,y,z)$. The distribution $\\Delta$ is of rank-$2$ and is generated by the vector fields:\n$$\nX_{1}=\\partial_{x}+y\\,\\partial_{z}, \\qquad X_{2}=\\partial_{y}\n$$\nSo, $\\Delta = \\mathrm{span}\\{X_1, X_2\\}$. We need to compute the growth vector at the point $p=(0,0,0)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the dimension of $\\Delta_p^1$. The subspace $\\Delta_p^1$ is spanned by the vectors $X_1(p)$ and $X_2(p)$. We evaluate the generating vector fields at $p=(0,0,0)$:\n$$\nX_1(p) = (\\partial_{x}+y\\,\\partial_{z})|_{(0,0,0)} = \\partial_{x}|_p + 0 \\cdot \\partial_{z}|_p = \\partial_{x}|_p\n$$\nIn the standard basis $\\{\\partial_x|_p, \\partial_y|_p, \\partial_z|_p\\}$ for $T_p\\mathbb{R}^3$, this vector corresponds to $(1, 0, 0)$.\n$$\nX_2(p) = \\partial_{y}|_{(0,0,0)} = \\partial_{y}|_p\n$$\nThis vector corresponds to $(0, 1, 0)$.\nThe vectors $X_1(p)$ and $X_2(p)$ are linearly independent. Thus, the dimension of the subspace they span is $2$.\n$$\n\\dim(\\Delta_p^1) = 2\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the dimension of $\\Delta_p^2$. The distribution $\\Delta^2$ is given by $\\Delta^2 = \\Delta^1 + [\\Delta^1, \\Delta^1]$. Since $\\Delta^1$ is generated by $X_1$ and $X_2$, the additional term $[\\Delta^1, \\Delta^1]$ is spanned by the Lie bracket $[X_1, X_2]$ (and multiples of it, and brackets like $[X_1, X_1]=0$). We compute this Lie bracket:\n$$\n[X_1, X_2] = [\\partial_x + y\\partial_z, \\partial_y]\n$$\nWe can compute the action of this bracket on the coordinate functions $x, y, z$.\n$$\n[X_1, X_2](x) = X_1(X_2(x)) - X_2(X_1(x)) = (\\partial_x + y\\partial_z)(\\partial_y(x)) - \\partial_y((\\partial_x + y\\partial_z)(x)) = X_1(0) - \\partial_y(1) = 0 - 0 = 0\n$$\n$$\n[X_1, X_2](y) = X_1(X_2(y)) - X_2(X_1(y)) = (\\partial_x + y\\partial_z)(\\partial_y(y)) - \\partial_y((\\partial_x + y\\partial_z)(y)) = X_1(1) - \\partial_y(0) = 0 - 0 = 0\n$$\n$$\n[X_1, X_2](z) = X_1(X_2(z)) - X_2(X_1(z)) = (\\partial_x + y\\partial_z)(\\partial_y(z)) - \\partial_y((\\partial_x + y\\partial_z)(z)) = X_1(0) - \\partial_y(y) = 0 - 1 = -1\n$$\nThus, the Lie bracket is the vector field:\n$$\n[X_1, X_2] = 0\\cdot\\partial_x + 0\\cdot\\partial_y - 1\\cdot\\partial_z = -\\partial_z\n$$\nThe subspace $\\Delta_p^2$ is spanned by $\\{X_1(p), X_2(p), [X_1, X_2](p)\\}$. We evaluate the new vector field at $p=(0,0,0)$:\n$$\n[X_1, X_2](p) = -\\partial_z|_p\n$$\nThis corresponds to the coordinate vector $(0, 0, -1)$.\nThe set of vectors spanning $\\Delta_p^2$ is $\\{\\partial_x|_p, \\partial_y|_p, -\\partial_z|_p\\}$, which corresponds to the set $\\{(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, -1)\\}$. These three vectors are linearly independent and form a basis for $T_p\\mathbb{R}^3 \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3$.\nTherefore, the dimension of $\\Delta_p^2$ is $3$.\n$$\n\\dim(\\Delta_p^2) = 3\n$$\nSince the dimension of $\\Delta_p^2$ is $3$, which is the dimension of the ambient manifold $M=\\mathbb{R}^3$, we have $\\Delta_p^2 = T_pM$. Any further steps in the filtration will not increase the dimension, i.e., $\\Delta_p^i = T_pM$ for all $i \\ge 2$. The sequence of dimensions has stabilized at step $i=2$.\n\nThe growth vector is the sequence of dimensions until stabilization: $(\\dim(\\Delta_p^1), \\dim(\\Delta_p^2))$.\nThe computed growth vector is $(2, 3)$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the optimal control law and the corresponding maximized Hamiltonian for a driftless, control-affine system with a quadratic cost functional. This is the canonical problem of sub-Riemannian geometry. The derivation will be performed using the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) on the cotangent bundle $T^{*}M$.\n\nLet a point on the cotangent bundle $T^{*}M$ be denoted by a pair $(x, p)$, where $x \\in M$ is a point on the manifold and $p \\in T_{x}^{*}M$ is a covector at that point. The PMP seeks to find necessary conditions for an optimal control $u(t)$ and its corresponding state trajectory $x(t)$. It introduces an auxiliary trajectory, the costate $p(t) \\in T_{x(t)}^{*}M$, which is a curve in the cotangent bundle covering the state trajectory.\n\nThe core of the PMP is the Pontryagin Hamiltonian (or pre-Hamiltonian), which is a function on $T^*M \\times \\mathbb{R}^m$. For a system with dynamics $\\dot{x} = f(x, u)$ and running cost $L(x, u)$, this Hamiltonian is defined as $H(x, p, u, \\lambda_0) = \\langle p, f(x,u) \\rangle - \\lambda_0 L(x,u)$, where $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ denotes the canonical pairing between a covector $p \\in T_x^*M$ and a vector $v \\in T_xM$. The constant $\\lambda_0$ is a non-negative number. For non-trivial extremals, $(\\lambda_0, p(t))$ cannot be identically zero. If $\\lambda_0 = 0$, the extremal is called abnormal. If $\\lambda_0 > 0$, the extremal is normal, and we can rescale the costate to set $\\lambda_0=1$. For the given problem, which involves minimizing energy on a controllable system, we consider normal extremals and set $\\lambda_0=1$.\n\nStep 1: Formulate the control-dependent Hamiltonian.\n\nThe system dynamics are given by $f(x,u) = \\dot{x}(t)=\\sum_{i=1}^{m}u_{i}(t)\\,X_{i}\\big(x(t)\\big)$. The running cost is $L(u) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|u(t)\\|^{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{m}u_{i}(t)^{2}$. The problem statement correctly notes that the cost only depends on the control $u$, not the state $x$.\n\nThe Pontryagin Hamiltonian $H_u(x,p)$, which depends on the control $u \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$, is constructed as:\n$$\nH_u(x,p) = \\langle p, f(x,u) \\rangle - L(u)\n$$\nSubstituting the given expressions for $f(x,u)$ and $L(u)$:\n$$\nH_u(x,p) = \\left\\langle p, \\sum_{i=1}^{m}u_{i}X_{i}(x) \\right\\rangle - \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{m}u_{i}^{2}\n$$\nUsing the linearity of the canonical pairing in its second argument, we can write:\n$$\nH_u(x,p) = \\sum_{i=1}^{m}u_{i}\\langle p, X_{i}(x) \\rangle - \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{m}u_{i}^{2}\n$$\nIt is standard to define the fiber-linear functions $H_i: T^*M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ as the Hamiltonian lifts of the vector fields $X_i$:\n$$\nH_i(x,p) := \\langle p, X_i(x) \\rangle\n$$\nIn local coordinates $(x^j, p_j)$, if $X_i = \\sum_{j=1}^n X_i^j(x) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}$, then $H_i(x,p) = \\sum_{j=1}^n p_j X_i^j(x)$.\nUsing this notation, the control-dependent Hamiltonian is:\n$$\nH_u(x,p) = \\sum_{i=1}^{m}u_{i}H_i(x,p) - \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{m}u_{i}^{2}\n$$\nThis completes the first step.\n\nStep 2: Impose the stationarity condition for the control.\n\nThe PMP states that for an optimal trajectory, the control $u^*(t)$ must maximize the Hamiltonian $H_u(x(t), p(t))$ for almost all $t \\in [0, T]$. That is,\n$$\nH_{u^*(t)}(x(t),p(t)) = \\max_{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^m} H_v(x(t),p(t))\n$$\nTo find the control $u^*$ that maximizes $H_u(x,p)$ for a fixed $(x,p)$, we find the critical points by setting the gradient with respect to $u$ to zero. For each component $u_j$ where $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial H_u}{\\partial u_j} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_j}\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{m}u_{i}H_i(x,p) - \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{m}u_{i}^{2} \\right) = H_j(x,p) - u_j\n$$\nSetting this to zero yields the stationarity condition:\n$$\nH_j(x,p) - u_j = 0 \\implies u_j = H_j(x,p)\n$$\nTo confirm this is a maximum, we examine the Hessian matrix of $H_u$ with respect to $u$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 H_u}{\\partial u_j \\partial u_k} = -\\delta_{jk}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_{jk}$ is the Kronecker delta. The Hessian is the negative of the $m \\times m$ identity matrix, which is negative definite. Thus, the stationarity condition indeed yields a unique global maximum.\n\nThe optimal control law is therefore given by:\n$$\nu_i^*(x,p) = H_i(x,p) = \\langle p, X_i(x) \\rangle \\quad \\text{for } i=1, \\dots, m\n$$\nThis provides the optimal control components as functions of the state $x$ and costate $p$.\n\nStep 3: Eliminate the control to find the sub-Riemannian Hamiltonian.\n\nThe maximized Hamiltonian, denoted $H_{SR}(x,p)$, is obtained by substituting the optimal control law $u^*(x,p)$ back into the expression for $H_u(x,p)$. This $H_{SR}(x,p)$ is the true Hamiltonian for the optimal system, whose integral curves on $T^*M$ are the optimal trajectories (extremals).\n$$\nH_{SR}(x,p) = H_{u^*(x,p)}(x,p) = \\sum_{i=1}^{m}u_i^*(x,p)H_i(x,p) - \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{m}(u_i^*(x,p))^2\n$$\nSubstituting $u_i^*(x,p) = H_i(x,p)$:\n$$\nH_{SR}(x,p) = \\sum_{i=1}^{m}H_i(x,p) \\cdot H_i(x,p) - \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{m}(H_i(x,p))^2\n$$\n$$\nH_{SR}(x,p) = \\sum_{i=1}^{m}H_i(x,p)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{m}H_i(x,p)^2\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nH_{SR}(x,p) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{m}H_i(x,p)^2\n$$\nSubstituting back the definition $H_i(x,p) = \\langle p, X_i(x) \\rangle$, the final expression for the sub-Riemannian Hamiltonian is:\n$$\nH_{SR}(x,p) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left( \\langle p, X_i(x) \\rangle \\right)^2\n$$\nThis Hamiltonian is quadratic in the covector $p$, which is a defining characteristic of sub-Riemannian and Riemannian geometry. The optimal trajectories $(x(t), p(t))$ are solutions to the Hamilton's equations derived from this Hamiltonian $H_{SR}$.\n\nIn summary, the final results are the expression for the optimal control component $u_i^*$ and the maximized sub-Riemannian Hamiltonian $H_{SR}$, both as functions of the state $x$ and costate $p$.\nThe optimal control for the $i$-th component is $u_i^*(x,p) = \\langle p, X_i(x) \\rangle$.\nThe maximized sub-Riemannian Hamiltonian is $H_{SR}(x,p) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left( \\langle p, X_i(x) \\rangle \\right)^2$.",

            "solution": "**1. Small-Time Local Controllability (STLC) vs. Global Controllability**\n\nLet $\\mathcal{R}_{g_0}^{\\le T}$ denote the set of points reachable from an initial point $g_0 \\in \\mathrm{O}(3)$ in time $t \\in [0, T]$ using the admissible controls. The full reachable set from $g_0$ is $\\mathcal{R}_{g_0} = \\bigcup_{T>0} \\mathcal{R}_{g_0}^{\\le T}$.\n\nSmall-Time Local Controllability (STLC) at a point $g_0$ is a local property. The system is STLC at $g_0$ if, for any time $T > 0$, the reachable set $\\mathcal{R}_{g_0}^{\\le T}$ contains an open neighborhood of $g_0$. This means that from $g_0$, one can reach any point in its immediate vicinity in an arbitrarily short amount of time.\n\nGlobal Controllability on a manifold $M$ is a global property. The system is globally controllable on $M$ if for any pair of points $g_a, g_b \\in M$, there exists a control trajectory that steers the system from $g_a$ to $g_b$. For a connected manifold, this is equivalent to the condition that the reachable set from any single point is the entire manifold, i.e., $\\mathcal{R}_{g_0} = M$.\n\nThe conceptual difference is one of scale and scope. STLC guarantees maneuverability within a small neighborhood, while global controllability guarantees the ability to connect any two arbitrary states on the manifold (or within a connected component). A system can be STLC everywhere but not globally controllable (e.g., if there are topological obstructions), or it can be globally controllable without being STLC at every point.\n\n**2. The Lie Algebra Rank Condition (LARC)**\n\nThe given system is $\\dot{g}(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} u_i(t) F_i(g(t))$, where the control vector fields are $F_i(g) = gA_i$. These are right-invariant vector fields on the Lie group $\\mathrm{O}(3)$. Let $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{so}(3)$. The Lie bracket of two such right-invariant vector fields, $F_i(g) = gA_i$ and $F_j(g) = gA_j$, corresponds to the right-invariant vector field associated with the Lie bracket of the generators in the Lie algebra: $[F_i, F_j](g) = g[A_i, A_j]_{\\mathfrak{g}}$, where $[A_i, A_j]_{\\mathfrak{g}} = A_iA_j - A_jA_i$.\n\nThe Lie Algebra Rank Condition (LARC) at a point $g \\in \\mathrm{O}(3)$ states that the dimension of the subspace spanned by the control vector fields and all their iterated Lie brackets, evaluated at $g$, must equal the dimension of the manifold. Let $\\mathcal{L}$ be the Lie algebra of vector fields generated by $\\{F_1, F_2, F_3\\}$. LARC at $g$ requires $\\dim(\\mathrm{span}\\{V(g) \\mid V \\in \\mathcal{L}\\}) = \\dim(\\mathrm{O}(3))$.\n\nFor a right-invariant system, this condition simplifies. The space spanned by the vector fields at any point $g$ is $g \\cdot \\mathrm{Lie}\\{A_1, A_2, A_3\\}$, where $\\mathrm{Lie}\\{A_1, A_2, A_3\\}$ is the Lie subalgebra of $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$ generated by the matrices $\\{A_1, A_2, A_3\\}$. The dimension of this space is constant for all $g \\in \\mathrm{O}(3)$. LARC is satisfied everywhere if and only if $\\mathrm{Lie}\\{A_1, A_2, A_3\\} = \\mathfrak{so}(3)$.\n\nThe problem states that $\\{A_1, A_2, A_3\\}$ is a basis for $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$. Since a basis of a vector space spans the entire space, we have $\\mathrm{span}\\{A_1, A_2, A_3\\} = \\mathfrak{so}(3)$. The Lie algebra generated by a set of vectors contains their span, so $\\mathrm{Lie}\\{A_1, A_2, A_3\\}$ must be at least $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$. As it is a subalgebra of $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$, it must be exactly $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$. The dimension of $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$ is $3$, which is also the dimension of the manifold $\\mathrm{O}(3)$. Thus, the rank of the distribution generated by the control vector fields is $3$ at every point $g \\in \\mathrm{O}(3)$.\nTherefore, the Lie Algebra Rank Condition holds for the given system at all points of $\\mathrm{O}(3)$.\n\n**3. STLC and Global Controllability Analysis**\n\nFor a driftless control system (where setting all controls to zero results in zero velocity), the Chow-Rashevskii theorem implies that if the LARC is satisfied at a point $g_0$, the system is small-time locally controllable at $g_0$. Since LARC holds everywhere on $\\mathrm{O}(3)$, the system is STLC at every point, including the identity $e \\in \\mathrm{SO}(3) \\subset \\mathrm{O}(3)$.\n\nTo analyze global controllability, we must consider the topology of $\\mathrm{O}(3)$. The determinant function $\\det: \\mathrm{O}(3) \\to \\{-1, 1\\}$ is continuous. This shows that $\\mathrm{O}(3)$ is not connected; it has two connected components: $\\mathrm{SO}(3) = \\{g \\in \\mathrm{O}(3) \\mid \\det(g)=1\\}$ and the set $\\{g \\in \\mathrm{O}(3) \\mid \\det(g)=-1\\}$.\nLet's analyze the evolution of the determinant along a trajectory $g(t)$. Using Jacobi's formula, $\\frac{d}{dt}\\det(g(t)) = \\det(g(t))\\mathrm{tr}\\big(g(t)^{-1}\\dot{g}(t)\\big)$. Substituting the system dynamics, $\\dot{g}(t) = g(t) \\sum_i u_i(t)A_i$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\det(g(t)) = \\det(g(t))\\mathrm{tr}\\left(g(t)^{-1}g(t)\\sum_i u_i(t)A_i\\right) = \\det(g(t))\\mathrm{tr}\\left(\\sum_i u_i(t)A_i\\right) $$\nSince each $A_i \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$ is a skew-symmetric matrix, its trace is zero, i.e., $\\mathrm{tr}(A_i)=0$. Thus, $\\mathrm{tr}\\left(\\sum_i u_i(t)A_i\\right) = 0$. This leads to $\\frac{d}{dt}\\det(g(t)) = 0$, which means $\\det(g(t))$ is a constant of motion.\nA trajectory starting in one connected component of $\\mathrm{O}(3)$ can never reach the other component. This represents a fundamental topological obstruction. Consequently, the system is **not** globally controllable on the entire manifold $\\mathrm{O}(3)$.\n\nWe can, however, consider controllability on the connected components. The identity element $e$ is in $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$. Any trajectory starting at $e$ is confined to $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$, so the reachable set from the identity, $\\mathcal{R}(e)$, must be a subset of $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$. The manifold $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ is a connected Lie group. For a right-invariant system on a connected Lie group $G$ with Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, the system is controllable if and only if the control vectors generate the entire Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$. As established in part 2, $\\mathrm{Lie}\\{A_1, A_2, A_3\\} = \\mathfrak{so}(3)$. Therefore, the system is controllable on the connected component $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$. This means the reachable set from the identity is the entire special orthogonal group: $\\mathcal{R}(e) = \\mathrm{SO}(3)$.\n\n**4. Euler Characteristic of the Reachable Set**\n\nFrom part 3, the reachable set from the identity is $\\mathcal{R}(e) = \\mathrm{SO}(3)$. We must compute the Euler characteristic $\\chi(\\mathrm{SO}(3))$. There are two standard methods to do this.\n\nMethod 1: Poincaré-Hopf Theorem.\nThe Poincaré-Hopf theorem states that for a compact, orientable manifold $M$, the Euler characteristic $\\chi(M)$ is equal to the sum of the indices of the zeros of any generic vector field on $M$. If a manifold admits a nowhere-vanishing vector field, the set of zeros is empty, and thus its Euler characteristic is $0$.\nAny compact Lie group, including $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$, admits a nowhere-vanishing vector field. For instance, pick any non-zero element $A \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$. The corresponding right-invariant vector field $F_A(g) = gA$ is non-zero for all $g \\in \\mathrm{SO}(3)$, since $g$ is always an invertible matrix. Therefore, $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ admits a nowhere-vanishing vector field, and its Euler characteristic must be zero.\n$$ \\chi(\\mathrm{SO}(3)) = 0 $$\n\nMethod 2: Betti Numbers via Homology.\nThe Euler characteristic is defined as the alternating sum of the Betti numbers $b_k = \\dim H_k(M, \\mathbb{R})$, where $H_k$ are the real homology groups: $\\chi(M) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\dim M} (-1)^k b_k(M)$.\nThe Lie group $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ is topologically equivalent (diffeomorphic) to the real projective space $\\mathbb{R}P^3$. The Betti numbers (with real coefficients) of $\\mathbb{R}P^n$ are $b_0=1$, and for $k>0$, $b_k=1$ if $k=n$ and $n$ is odd, and $b_k=0$ otherwise.\nFor $\\mathrm{SO}(3) \\cong \\mathbb{R}P^3$, we have $\\dim M = 3$, which is odd. The Betti numbers are:\n$b_0(\\mathrm{SO}(3)) = 1$ (for the single connected component)\n$b_1(\\mathrm{SO}(3)) = 0$\n$b_2(\\mathrm{SO}(3)) = 0$\n$b_3(\\mathrm{SO}(3)) = 1$\nThe Euler characteristic is then:\n$$ \\chi(\\mathcal{R}(e)) = \\chi(\\mathrm{SO}(3)) = \\sum_{k=0}^3 (-1)^k b_k(\\mathrm{SO}(3)) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 = 1 - 0 + 0 - 1 = 0 $$\nBoth methods yield the same result. The Euler characteristic of the reachable set from the identity is $0$.",
