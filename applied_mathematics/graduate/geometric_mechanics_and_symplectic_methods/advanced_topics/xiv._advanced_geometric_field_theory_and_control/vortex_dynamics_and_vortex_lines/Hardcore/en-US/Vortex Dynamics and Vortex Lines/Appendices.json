            "solution": "This is a valid problem in fluid dynamics. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n(a) Derivation of the Poisson Relation and Biot-Savart Law\n\nWe are given the definition of scalar vorticity $\\omega$ in two dimensions as\n$$\n\\omega := \\partial_{1} u_{2} - \\partial_{2} u_{1}\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{u} = (u_{1}, u_{2})$ is the velocity field and $\\partial_{i}$ denotes the partial derivative with respect to the spatial coordinate $x_{i}$.\nWe are also given the definition of the streamfunction $\\psi$, which exists for an incompressible flow ($\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u} = 0$), via the relation\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{u} = \\nabla^{\\perp} \\psi\n$$\nwhere the perpendicular gradient is defined as $\\nabla^{\\perp} := (-\\partial_{2}, \\partial_{1})$. This gives the components of the velocity field as\n$$\nu_{1} = -\\partial_{2} \\psi \\quad \\text{and} \\quad u_{2} = \\partial_{1} \\psi\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions for the velocity components into the definition of vorticity, we obtain:\n$$\n\\omega = \\partial_{1} (\\partial_{1} \\psi) - \\partial_{2} (-\\partial_{2} \\psi) = \\partial_{1}^{2} \\psi + \\partial_{2}^{2} \\psi\n$$\nThis is the Poisson equation relating the streamfunction $\\psi$ to the vorticity $\\omega$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\psi = \\omega\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta := \\partial_{1}^{2} + \\partial_{2}^{2}$ is the Laplacian operator in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\n\nTo solve this partial differential equation for $\\psi$, we introduce the concept of the inverse Laplacian operator, $\\Delta^{-1}$. On the unbounded domain $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with suitable decay conditions at infinity, this inverse operator can be represented as a convolution with a fundamental solution, or Green's function, $G(x)$. The Green's function for the Laplacian is defined by the equation:\n$$\n\\Delta G(x) = \\delta(x)\n$$\nwhere $\\delta(x)$ is the two-dimensional Dirac delta function. The solution to $\\Delta \\psi = \\omega$ is then formally given by the convolution:\n$$\n\\psi(x) = (\\Delta^{-1} \\omega)(x) = (G * \\omega)(x) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{2}} G(x-y) \\omega(y) \\, d^{2}y\n$$\nWe must show that the Green's function is $G(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\log |x|$. To verify this, we compute its Laplacian in the sense of distributions. For any $x \\neq 0$, we can compute the derivatives directly. Let $r = |x| = \\sqrt{x_{1}^{2} + x_{2}^{2}}$.\nThe gradient of $G$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla G(x) = \\nabla \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\log r \\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r} \\nabla r = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r} \\frac{x}{r} = \\frac{x}{2\\pi |x|^{2}}\n$$\nThe Laplacian is the divergence of the gradient:\n$$\n\\Delta G(x) = \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla G) = \\nabla \\cdot \\left( \\frac{x}{2\\pi |x|^{2}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{1}} \\frac{x_{1}}{x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{2}} \\frac{x_{2}}{x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}} \\right)\n$$\nComputing the partial derivatives for $x \\neq 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{1}} \\frac{x_{1}}{x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}} = \\frac{(x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2})(1) - x_{1}(2x_{1})}{(x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2})^{2}} = \\frac{x_{2}^{2}-x_{1}^{2}}{(x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2})^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{2}} \\frac{x_{2}}{x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}} = \\frac{(x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2})(1) - x_{2}(2x_{2})}{(x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2})^{2}} = \\frac{x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}}{(x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2})^{2}}\n$$\nSumming these two terms gives $\\Delta G(x) = 0$ for all $x \\neq 0$. The Laplacian is non-zero only at the singularity at $x=0$. To find its total strength, we integrate $\\Delta G$ over a small disk $D_{\\epsilon}$ of radius $\\epsilon$ centered at the origin and apply the divergence theorem:\n$$\n\\int_{D_{\\epsilon}} \\Delta G \\, dA = \\int_{\\partial D_{\\epsilon}} \\nabla G \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} \\, ds\n$$\nHere, $\\partial D_{\\epsilon}$ is the circle of radius $\\epsilon$, the outward unit normal is $\\boldsymbol{n} = x/|x| = x/\\epsilon$, and the arc length element is $ds = \\epsilon \\, d\\theta$.\n$$\n\\nabla G \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} = \\left( \\frac{x}{2\\pi |x|^{2}} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{x}{|x|} \\right) = \\frac{|x|^{2}}{2\\pi |x|^{3}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi |x|}\n$$\nOn the circle $\\partial D_{\\epsilon}$, where $|x|=\\epsilon$, this value is $\\frac{1}{2\\pi\\epsilon}$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\epsilon} \\right) (\\epsilon \\, d\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = 1\n$$\nSince this integral is $1$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$, taking the limit as $\\epsilon \\to 0$ demonstrates that $\\Delta G(x) = \\delta(x)$ in the sense of distributions. This confirms that $\\psi = G * \\omega$.\n\nFinally, we express the velocity field $\\boldsymbol{u}$ in terms of $\\omega$. Starting from $\\boldsymbol{u} = \\nabla^{\\perp} \\psi$ and substituting $\\psi = \\Delta^{-1} \\omega = G * \\omega$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{u} = \\nabla^{\\perp} (\\Delta^{-1} \\omega) = \\nabla^{\\perp} (G * \\omega)\n$$\nSince the differentiation operator $\\nabla^{\\perp}$ commutes with convolution, we can write:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{u} = (\\nabla^{\\perp} G) * \\omega\n$$\nThis is the Biot-Savart law for 2D Euler flows. This completes the derivation for part (a).\n\n(b) Velocity of a Rankine Vortex\n\nWe are given a circular vortex patch of radius $R$ and constant vorticity $\\omega_{0}$, described by\n$$\n\\omega(x) = \\omega_{0} \\,\\mathbf{1}_{\\{|x|<R\\}}(x)\n$$\nWe need to find the azimuthal component of velocity $u_{\\theta}(r)$ as a function of the radial distance $r=|x|$. The problem suggests using the results of part (a) and conservation of circulation. The relation between circulation and vorticity is given by Stokes' theorem in the plane (also known as Green's theorem):\n$$\n\\oint_{C} \\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot d\\boldsymbol{l} = \\iint_{S} (\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{u})_{z} \\, dA = \\iint_{S} \\omega \\, dA\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a closed curve and $S$ is the region it encloses.\n\nDue to the radial symmetry of the vorticity distribution, the resulting velocity field must also be symmetric. This implies the velocity is purely azimuthal, so $\\boldsymbol{u}(x) = u_{\\theta}(r) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$, where $r=|x|$ and $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ is the azimuthal unit vector.\n\nLet's choose the curve $C$ to be a circle of radius $r$ centered at the origin. The left-hand side of Stokes' theorem (the circulation) becomes:\n$$\n\\oint_{C} \\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot d\\boldsymbol{l} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} (u_{\\theta}(r) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}) \\cdot (r \\, d\\theta \\, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}) = u_{\\theta}(r) \\cdot r \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = 2\\pi r u_{\\theta}(r)\n$$\nThe right-hand side is the total vorticity enclosed by the circle of radius $r$. We must consider two cases.\n\nCase 1: $r < R$ (inside the vortex patch)\nThe integration area $S$ is the disk of radius $r$. Within this disk, the vorticity is constant, $\\omega = \\omega_{0}$.\n$$\n\\iint_{S} \\omega \\, dA = \\iint_{|x|<r} \\omega_{0} \\, dA = \\omega_{0} \\cdot (\\text{Area of } S) = \\omega_{0} \\pi r^{2}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for circulation:\n$$\n2\\pi r u_{\\theta}(r) = \\omega_{0} \\pi r^{2} \\implies u_{\\theta}(r) = \\frac{\\omega_{0} r}{2}\n$$\n\nCase 2: $r \\ge R$ (outside the vortex patch)\nThe integration area $S$ is still the disk of radius $r$. However, the vorticity is non-zero only within the sub-disk of radius $R$.\n$$\n\\iint_{S} \\omega \\, dA = \\iint_{|x|<R} \\omega_{0} \\, dA = \\omega_{0} \\cdot (\\text{Area of patch}) = \\omega_{0} \\pi R^{2}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for circulation:\n$$\n2\\pi r u_{\\theta}(r) = \\omega_{0} \\pi R^{2} \\implies u_{\\theta}(r) = \\frac{\\omega_{0} R^{2}}{2r}\n$$\n\nThe final step is to combine these two cases into a single closed-form expression using the minimum function, as requested.\nThe velocity is $u_{\\theta}(r) = \\frac{\\omega_{0} r}{2}$ for $r<R$ and $u_{\\theta}(r) = \\frac{\\omega_{0} R^{2}}{2r}$ for $r \\ge R$.\nWe can write this as:\n$$\nu_{\\theta}(r) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{\\omega_{0}}{2r} r^{2} & \\text{if } r < R \\\\ \\frac{\\omega_{0}}{2r} R^{2} & \\text{if } r \\ge R \\end{cases}\n$$\nThis structure can be expressed compactly using the minimum function $\\min(a,b)$, which returns the smaller of $a$ and $b$. If $r < R$, then $r^{2} < R^{2}$, and $\\min(r^{2}, R^{2}) = r^{2}$. If $r \\ge R$, then $r^{2} \\ge R^{2}$, and $\\min(r^{2}, R^{2}) = R^{2}$.\nTherefore, a single expression valid for all $r>0$ is:\n$$\nu_{\\theta}(r) = \\frac{\\omega_{0}}{2r} \\min(r^{2}, R^{2})\n$$",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a relation between the peak axial vorticity $\\omega_{\\mathrm{peak}}(t)$ and the equivalent radius $a(t)$ of a slender vortex tube in an inviscid, incompressible fluid. The starting point for this derivation is the definition of circulation $\\Gamma$ and its conservation as stipulated by Kelvin's circulation theorem for a material loop.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the vortex tube is a material entity, and we consider a material loop that encircles it. Kelvin's theorem guarantees that the circulation $\\Gamma$ for such a loop is constant in time, i.e., $\\frac{d\\Gamma}{dt} = 0$.\n\nThe circulation $\\Gamma$ is defined as the line integral of the velocity field $\\mathbf{u}$ around a closed curve $C$, which by Stokes' theorem is equal to the flux of the vorticity field $\\boldsymbol{\\omega} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{u}$ through any surface $S$ bounded by $C$.\n$$\n\\Gamma = \\oint_{C} \\mathbf{u} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = \\int_{S} (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{u}) \\cdot d\\mathbf{S} = \\int_{S} \\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S}\n$$\nWe choose the surface $S$ to be a cross-section of the flow perpendicular to the vortex tube's centerline.

This implies $R a^2 = \\text{constant}$.\n\n*   **Derivative of Impulse**:\n    $$ \\frac{dI_z}{dR} = \\frac{d}{dR} (\\pi \\rho \\Gamma R^2) = 2\\pi\\rho \\Gamma R $$\n\n*   **Derivative of Energy**: We differentiate the expression for $E$ with respect to $R$.\n    $$ \\frac{dE}{dR} = \\frac{d}{dR} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} \\rho \\Gamma^2 R \\left( \\ln(8) + \\ln(R) - \\ln(a) - \\frac{7}{4} \\right) \\right] $$\n    Using the product rule and the constraint $R a^2 = C \\implies \\frac{da}{dR} = -\\frac{a}{2R}$:\n    $$ \\frac{dE}{dR} = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho \\Gamma^2 \\left[ \\left( \\ln\\left(\\frac{8R}{a}\\right) - \\frac{7}{4} \\right) \\cdot 1 + R \\left( \\frac{1}{R} - \\frac{1}{a}\\frac{da}{dR} \\right) \\right] $$\n    $$ \\frac{dE}{dR} = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho \\Gamma^2 \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{8R}{a}\\right) - \\frac{7}{4} + R \\left( \\frac{1}{R} - \\frac{1}{a} \\left(-\\frac{a}{2R}\\right) \\right) \\right] $$\n    $$ \\frac{dE}{dR} = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho \\Gamma^2 \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{8R}{a}\\right) - \\frac{7}{4} + 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho \\Gamma^2 \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{8R}{a}\\right) - \\frac{7}{4} + \\frac{6}{4} \\right] $$\n    $$ \\frac{dE}{dR} = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho \\Gamma^2 \\left( \\ln\\left(\\frac{8R}{a}\\right) - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) $$\n\n*   **Final Speed Calculation**:\n    $$ U = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\rho \\Gamma^2 \\left( \\ln\\left(\\frac{8R}{a}\\right) - \\frac{1}{4} \\right)}{2\\pi\\rho \\Gamma R} $$\n    Simplifying this expression by canceling terms yields the final result:\n    $$ U = \\frac{\\Gamma}{4\\pi R} \\left( \\ln\\left(\\frac{8R}{a}\\right) - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) $$\n    This is the classical Lamb-Szebehely velocity for a vortex ring with a uniform core.",
