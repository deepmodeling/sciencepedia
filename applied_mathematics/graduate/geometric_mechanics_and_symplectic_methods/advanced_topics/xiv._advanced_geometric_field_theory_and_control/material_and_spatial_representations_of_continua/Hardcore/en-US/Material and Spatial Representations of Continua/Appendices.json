            "solution": "The problem presents a valid and well-posed question within the framework of continuum mechanics. We shall proceed with the solution by systematically applying the foundational definitions as requested.\n\nThe position $x$ of a material point in the current (spatial) configuration is given as a function of its position $X$ in the reference (material) configuration and time $t$. This function is the motion map $\\varphi_{t}$. Let $x = \\varphi_{t}(X)$. The problem provides this map in matrix form:\n$$\nx(X,t) = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1(X,t) \\\\ x_2(X,t) \\\\ x_3(X,t) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\alpha(t) & \\gamma(t) & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\beta(t) & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\delta(t)\n\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} X_1 \\\\ X_2 \\\\ X_3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $X = (X_1, X_2, X_3)$ are the material coordinates and $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3)$ are the spatial coordinates. The functions $\\alpha(t)$, $\\beta(t)$, $\\gamma(t)$, and $\\delta(t)$ are given smooth functions of time $t$. The scalar $0$ is the number zero.\n\nExpanding the matrix multiplication gives the spatial coordinates in terms of the material coordinates:\n$$\nx_1(X_1, X_2, X_3, t) = \\alpha(t) X_1 + \\gamma(t) X_2\n$$\n$$\nx_2(X_1, X_2, X_3, t) = \\beta(t) X_2\n$$\n$$\nx_3(X_1, X_2, X_3, t) = \\delta(t) X_3\n$$\n\nThe first task is to compute the deformation gradient, $F(X,t)$. The deformation gradient is a second-order tensor defined as the gradient of the motion map with respect to the material coordinates $X$. In component form, its elements are given by $F_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial x_i}{\\partial X_j}$.\nWe compute the nine components of $F$:\n$$\nF_{11} = \\frac{\\partial x_1}{\\partial X_1} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X_1} (\\alpha(t) X_1 + \\gamma(t) X_2) = \\alpha(t)\n$$\n$$\nF_{12} = \\frac{\\partial x_1}{\\partial X_2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X_2} (\\alpha(t) X_1 + \\gamma(t) X_2) = \\gamma(t)\n$$\n$$\nF_{13} = \\frac{\\partial x_1}{\\partial X_3} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X_3} (\\alpha(t) X_1 + \\gamma(t) X_2) = 0\n$$\n$$\nF_{21} = \\frac{\\partial x_2}{\\partial X_1} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X_1} (\\beta(t) X_2) = 0\n$$\n$$\nF_{22} = \\frac{\\partial x_2}{\\partial X_2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X_2} (\\beta(t) X_2) = \\beta(t)\n$$\n$$\nF_{23} = \\frac{\\partial x_2}{\\partial X_3} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X_3} (\\beta(t) X_2) = 0\n$$\n$$\nF_{31} = \\frac{\\partial x_3}{\\partial X_1} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X_1} (\\delta(t) X_3) = 0\n$$\n$$\nF_{32} = \\frac{\\partial x_3}{\\partial X_2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X_2} (\\delta(t) X_3) = 0\n$$\n$$\nF_{33} = \\frac{\\partial x_3}{\\partial X_3} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X_3} (\\delta(t) X_3) = \\delta(t)\n$$\nAssembling these components into a matrix, we obtain the deformation gradient:\n$$\nF(X,t) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\alpha(t) & \\gamma(t) & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\beta(t) & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\delta(t)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince the motion is a linear transformation of the reference coordinates (a homogeneous deformation), the deformation gradient $F$ is uniform throughout the body, meaning it is independent of the material position $X$. Therefore, we can write it as $F(t)$.\n\nThe second task is to compute the Jacobian determinant, $J(X,t)$. The Jacobian determinant is defined as the determinant of the deformation gradient matrix, $J = \\det(F)$. Since $F$ is independent of $X$, $J$ will also be independent of $X$, so we denote it as $J(t)$.\nWe compute the determinant of the $3 \\times 3$ matrix $F(t)$:\n$$\nJ(t) = \\det(F(t)) = \\det\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\alpha(t) & \\gamma(t) & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\beta(t) & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\delta(t)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe matrix is upper triangular, so its determinant is the product of its diagonal entries:\n$$\nJ(t) = \\alpha(t) \\cdot \\beta(t) \\cdot \\delta(t)\n$$\n\nThe third task is to use the physical meaning of $J$ to determine the conditions for which $J(X,t) > 0$. Physically, the Jacobian determinant $J$ represents the local ratio of an infinitesimal volume element in the current (deformed) configuration, $dv$, to the corresponding volume element in the reference configuration, $dV$. That is, $J = \\frac{dv}{dV}$. For a deformation to be physically admissible for a continuous material body, matter cannot be created or destroyed, nor can it interpenetrate itself. This implies that a volume element cannot be compressed to zero or negative volume. Thus, the condition $J > 0$ must hold.\n$J > 0$ also ensures that the local orientation of the material is preserved. A negative Jacobian would imply a local inversion or reflection of the material, which is typically considered unphysical.\nGiven our expression for $J(t)$, the condition $J(t) > 0$ translates to:\n$$\n\\alpha(t) \\beta(t) \\delta(t) > 0\n$$\nThis inequality holds if and only if all three functions $\\alpha(t)$, $\\beta(t)$, and $\\delta(t)$ are positive, or if exactly two of them are negative and one is positive, for any given time $t$. The function $\\gamma(t)$ represents a shear deformation and does not affect the volume change, so it does not appear in the expression for $J(t)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the single closed-form analytic expression for $J(t)$ as the final answer.\n$$\nJ(t) = \\alpha(t) \\beta(t) \\delta(t)\n$$",

It is a complete, consistent, and standard problem in geometric mechanics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution will now be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Area Mapping Formula (Nanson's Formula)\n\nThe derivation begins from first principles of geometric mapping. An infinitesimal material area element can be defined by the cross product of two non-collinear infinitesimal vectors, $d\\boldsymbol{X}^{(1)}$ and $d\\boldsymbol{X}^{(2)}$, that lie on the material plane. The oriented material area vector is thus:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{N}\\,dA = d\\boldsymbol{X}^{(1)} \\times d\\boldsymbol{X}^{(2)}\n$$\nThe deformation map $\\boldsymbol{x}=\\boldsymbol{\\chi}(\\boldsymbol{X},t)$ maps the material point $\\boldsymbol{X}$ to the spatial point $\\boldsymbol{x}$. Locally, this map is approximated by its linearization, the tangent map, which is given by the deformation gradient $\\boldsymbol{F}$. Therefore, the material vectors $d\\boldsymbol{X}^{(1)}$ and $d\\boldsymbol{X}^{(2)}$ are mapped to their spatial counterparts $d\\boldsymbol{x}^{(1)}$ and $d\\boldsymbol{x}^{(2)}$ as follows:\n$$\nd\\boldsymbol{x}^{(1)} = \\boldsymbol{F}\\,d\\boldsymbol{X}^{(1)} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad d\\boldsymbol{x}^{(2)} = \\boldsymbol{F}\\,d\\boldsymbol{X}^{(2)}\n$$\nThese two spatial vectors define the transformed area element in the spatial configuration. The oriented spatial area vector is their cross product:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{n}\\,da = d\\boldsymbol{x}^{(1)} \\times d\\boldsymbol{x}^{(2)} = (\\boldsymbol{F}\\,d\\boldsymbol{X}^{(1)}) \\times (\\boldsymbol{F}\\,d\\boldsymbol{X}^{(2)})\n$$\nTo proceed, we use a standard identity from linear algebra relating the cross product of two transformed vectors to the transformation tensor. For any invertible second-order tensor $\\boldsymbol{F}$ and any two vectors $\\boldsymbol{u}$ and $\\boldsymbol{v}$, the identity is:\n$$\n(\\boldsymbol{F}\\boldsymbol{u}) \\times (\\boldsymbol{F}\\boldsymbol{v}) = (\\det\\boldsymbol{F})\\, \\boldsymbol{F}^{-T} (\\boldsymbol{u} \\times \\boldsymbol{v})\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{F}^{-T} = (\\boldsymbol{F}^{-1})^T$ is the inverse transpose of $\\boldsymbol{F}$. Applying this identity with $\\boldsymbol{u}=d\\boldsymbol{X}^{(1)}$ and $\\boldsymbol{v}=d\\boldsymbol{X}^{(2)}$, we get:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{n}\\,da = (\\det\\boldsymbol{F})\\, \\boldsymbol{F}^{-T} (d\\boldsymbol{X}^{(1)} \\times d\\boldsymbol{X}^{(2)})\n$$\nSubstituting the definitions $J = \\det\\boldsymbol{F}$ and $\\boldsymbol{N}\\,dA = d\\boldsymbol{X}^{(1)} \\times d\\boldsymbol{X}^{(2)}$, we arrive at the desired relationship, known as Nanson's formula:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{n}\\,da = J\\,\\boldsymbol{F}^{-T}\\,\\boldsymbol{N}\\,dA\n$$\n\n### Application to the Specific Case\n\nWe are given the following:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{F}=\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 3 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\tfrac{1}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\boldsymbol{N}=\\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad dA=0.12\n$$\nFirst, we compute the Jacobian determinant $J$:\n$$\nJ = \\det\\boldsymbol{F} = (2)(3)(\\tfrac{1}{2}) = 3\n$$\nNext, we find the inverse of $\\boldsymbol{F}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{F}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{J} \\text{adj}(\\boldsymbol{F})^T = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{3}{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{2} & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 6\n\\end{pmatrix}^T = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{3}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 6\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{1}{6} & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{3} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we find the inverse transpose, $\\boldsymbol{F}^{-T}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{F}^{-T} = (\\boldsymbol{F}^{-1})^T = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{6} & \\frac{1}{3} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nUsing Nanson's formula, we compute the oriented spatial area vector $\\boldsymbol{n}\\,da$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{n}\\,da = J\\,dA\\,(\\boldsymbol{F}^{-T}\\boldsymbol{N}) = (3)(0.12) \\left( \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{6} & \\frac{1}{3} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{n}\\,da = 0.36 \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{6} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.18 \\\\ -0.06 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe magnitude of this vector is the spatial area $da$:\n$$\nda = \\left\\| \\begin{pmatrix} 0.18 \\\\ -0.06 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\| = \\sqrt{(0.18)^2 + (-0.06)^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{(3 \\times 0.06)^2 + (-0.06)^2} = \\sqrt{9 \\times (0.06)^2 + (0.06)^2} = \\sqrt{10 \\times (0.06)^2} = 0.06\\sqrt{10}\n$$\nThe spatial unit normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$ is found by normalizing the vector $\\boldsymbol{n}\\,da$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{n} = \\frac{1}{da} (\\boldsymbol{n}\\,da) = \\frac{1}{0.06\\sqrt{10}} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.18 \\\\ -0.06 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{10}} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSo, for part 2, the answers are:\n1.  The spatial unit normal is $\\boldsymbol{n} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{10}} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n2.  The spatial area element is $da = 0.06\\sqrt{10}$ square meters.\n\n### Numerical Verification\n\nWe are asked to verify that the flux across the spatial element equals the corresponding flux in the material framework. The flux of a vector field $\\boldsymbol{a}$ is given by the integral $\\int_s \\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} \\, da$. For an infinitesimal element, this is simply $\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{n}\\,da)$.\n\nThe flux in the spatial description, $\\Phi_s$, is:\n$$\n\\Phi_s = \\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{n}\\,da) = \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 0.18 \\\\ -0.06 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = (6)(0.18) + (3)(-0.06) + (0)(0) = 1.08 - 0.18 = 0.9\n$$\nThe corresponding flux identity in the material description (the Piola transformation for flux integrals) is $\\int_s \\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot d\\boldsymbol{s} = \\int_S J\\boldsymbol{F}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot d\\boldsymbol{S}$. For infinitesimal elements, this is $(\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n})da = (J\\boldsymbol{F}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{a}) \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{N}dA)$.\n\nThe flux in the material description, $\\Phi_m$, is computed by first transforming the vector field $\\boldsymbol{a}$ and then taking the dot product with the material area vector $\\boldsymbol{N}dA$.\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{F}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{a} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{1}{6} & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{3} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (\\frac{1}{2})(6) - (\\frac{1}{6})(3) \\\\ (\\frac{1}{3})(3) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 - \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{5}{2} \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow we compute the flux $\\Phi_m$:\n$$\n\\Phi_m = \\left( J (\\boldsymbol{F}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{a}) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{N} \\right) dA = \\left( 3 \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{5}{2} \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix} \\right) (0.12) = \\left( 3 \\left( \\frac{5}{2} \\right) \\right) (0.12) = 7.5 \\times 0.12 = 0.9\n$$\nSince $\\Phi_s = 0.9$ and $\\Phi_m = 0.9$, the fluxes are equal, which numerically verifies the derived area mapping formula and the subsequent calculations.\n\nThe final requested answer is the row matrix $(n_1, n_2, n_3, da)$.\n$n_1 = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{10}}$, $n_2 = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}}$, $n_3=0$, $da=0.06\\sqrt{10}$.",

It is defined as the evaluation of the $1$-form $\\alpha$ on the vector field $v$:\n$$\n\\iota_{v}\\alpha = \\alpha(v) = (\\alpha_{j}dx^{j})\\left(v^{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\right) = \\alpha_{j}v^{i}\\delta_{i}^{j} = \\alpha_{i}v^{i}\n$$\nNext, we take the exterior derivative of this scalar function:\n$$\nd(\\iota_{v}\\alpha) = d(\\alpha_{i}v^{i}) = \\frac{\\partial(\\alpha_{i}v^{i})}{\\partial x^{j}}dx^{j}\n$$\nUsing the product rule, the components of this $1$-form are:\n$$\n\\big(d(\\iota_{v}\\alpha)\\big)_{j} = \\frac{\\partial(\\alpha_{i}v^{i})}{\\partial x^{j}} = v^{i}\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{i}}{\\partial x^{j}} + \\alpha_{i}\\frac{\\partial v^{i}}{\\partial x^{j}}\n$$\n\nThe second term involves the exterior derivative of $\\alpha$, which is a $2$-form:\n$$\nd\\alpha = d(\\alpha_{k}dx^{k}) = \\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{k}}{\\partial x^{j}}dx^{j} \\wedge dx^{k}\n$$\nNow, we take the interior product of $d\\alpha$ with $v$:\n$$\n\\iota_{v}(d\\alpha) = \\iota_{v}\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{k}}{\\partial x^{j}}dx^{j} \\wedge dx^{k}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{k}}{\\partial x^{j}}\\iota_{v}(dx^{j} \\wedge dx^{k})\n$$\nUsing the property $\\iota_{v}(dx^{j} \\wedge dx^{k}) = (\\iota_{v}dx^{j})dx^{k} - dx^{j}(\\iota_{v}dx^{k}) = v^{j}dx^{k} - v^{k}dx^{j}$, we get:\n$$\n\\iota_{v}(d\\alpha) = \\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{k}}{\\partial x^{j}}(v^{j}dx^{k} - v^{k}dx^{j})\n$$\nTo find the $m$-th component of this $1$-form, we collect the coefficients of $dx^{m}$.\nFrom the first part, $\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{k}}{\\partial x^{j}}v^{j}dx^{k}$, we set $k=m$ to get the term $\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{m}}{\\partial x^{j}}v^{j}$.\nFrom the second part, $-\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{k}}{\\partial x^{j}}v^{k}dx^{j}$, we set $j=m$ to get the term $-\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{k}}{\\partial x^{m}}v^{k}$.\nRelabeling the summation indices, the $j$-th component of $\\iota_{v}(d\\alpha)$ is:\n$$\n\\big(\\iota_{v}(d\\alpha)\\big)_{j} = v^{i}\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{j}}{\\partial x^{i}} - v^{i}\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{i}}{\\partial x^{j}}\n$$\n\nCombining the components of the two terms, we get the $j$-th component of $\\mathcal{L}_{v}\\alpha$:\n$$\n(\\mathcal{L}_{v}\\alpha)_{j} = \\big(d(\\iota_{v}\\alpha)\\big)_{j} + \\big(\\iota_{v}(d\\alpha)\\big)_{j} = \\left(v^{i}\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{i}}{\\partial x^{j}} + \\alpha_{i}\\frac{\\partial v^{i}}{\\partial x^{j}}\\right) + \\left(v^{i}\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{j}}{\\partial x^{i}} - v^{i}\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{i}}{\\partial x^{j}}\\right)\n$$\nThe terms $v^{i}\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{i}}{\\partial x^{j}}$ and $-v^{i}\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{i}}{\\partial x^{j}}$ cancel. The resulting coordinate expression is:\n$$\n(\\mathcal{L}_{v}\\alpha)_{j} = v^{i}\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{j}}{\\partial x^{i}} + \\alpha_{i}\\frac{\\partial v^{i}}{\\partial x^{j}}\n$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this for the given fields:\n$v(x) = (v^{1}, v^{2}, v^{3}) = (x^{2}, x^{3}, -x^{1})$\n$\\alpha(x) = (\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{2}, \\alpha_{3}) = ((x^{1})^{2} + x^{2}, x^{2}x^{3}, \\sin(x^{1}))$\n\nWe compute the necessary partial derivatives:\nThe velocity gradient tensor components $\\partial_{j}v^{i} = \\frac{\\partial v^{i}}{\\partial x^{j}}$ form the matrix:\n$$\n\\nabla v = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial v^{1}}{\\partial x^{1}} & \\frac{\\partial v^{1}}{\\partial x^{2}} & \\frac{\\partial v^{1}}{\\partial x^{3}} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial v^{2}}{\\partial x^{1}} & \\frac{\\partial v^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}} & \\frac{\\partial v^{2}}{\\partial x^{3}} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial v^{3}}{\\partial x^{1}} & \\frac{\\partial v^{3}}{\\partial x^{2}} & \\frac{\\partial v^{3}}{\\partial x^{3}} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe partial derivatives of the components of $\\alpha$ are:\n$\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{1}}{\\partial x^{1}} = 2x^{1}$, $\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{1}}{\\partial x^{2}} = 1$, $\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{1}}{\\partial x^{3}} = 0$\n$\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{2}}{\\partial x^{1}} = 0$, $\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{2}}{\\partial x^{2}} = x^{3}$, $\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{2}}{\\partial x^{3}} = x^{2}$\n$\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{3}}{\\partial x^{1}} = \\cos(x^{1})$, $\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{3}}{\\partial x^{2}} = 0$, $\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{3}}{\\partial x^{3}} = 0$\n\nUsing the derived formula $(\\mathcal{L}_{v}\\alpha)_{j} = v^{i}\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{j}}{\\partial x^{i}} + \\alpha_{i}\\frac{\\partial v^{i}}{\\partial x^{j}}$, we compute each component of $\\mathcal{L}_{v}\\alpha$:\nFor $j=1$:\n$(\\mathcal{L}_{v}\\alpha)_{1} = (v^{1}\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{1}}{\\partial x^{1}} + v^{2}\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{1}}{\\partial x^{2}} + v^{3}\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{1}}{\\partial x^{3}}) + (\\alpha_{1}\\frac{\\partial v^{1}}{\\partial x^{1}} + \\alpha_{2}\\frac{\\partial v^{2}}{\\partial x^{1}} + \\alpha_{3}\\frac{\\partial v^{3}}{\\partial x^{1}})$\n$= (x^{2}(2x^{1}) + x^{3}(1) + (-x^{1})(0)) + (((x^{1})^{2}+x^2)(0) + (x^2 x^3)(0) + (\\sin x^{1})(-1)) = 2x^{1}x^{2} + x^{3} - \\sin(x^{1})$\n\nFor $j=2$:\n$(\\mathcal{L}_{v}\\alpha)_{2} = (v^{1}\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{2}}{\\partial x^{1}} + v^{2}\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{2}}{\\partial x^{2}} + v^{3}\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{2}}{\\partial x^{3}}) + (\\alpha_{1}\\frac{\\partial v^{1}}{\\partial x^{2}} + \\alpha_{2}\\frac{\\partial v^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}} + \\alpha_{3}\\frac{\\partial v^{3}}{\\partial x^{2}})$\n$= (x^{2}(0) + x^{3}(x^{3}) + (-x^{1})(x^{2})) + (((x^{1})^{2}+x^2)(1) + (x^2 x^3)(0) + (\\sin x^{1})(0)) = (x^{3})^{2} - x^{1}x^{2} + (x^{1})^{2} + x^{2}$\n\nFor $j=3$:\n$(\\mathcal{L}_{v}\\alpha)_{3} = (v^{1}\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{3}}{\\partial x^{1}} + v^{2}\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{3}}{\\partial x^{2}} + v^{3}\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{3}}{\\partial x^{3}}) + (\\alpha_{1}\\frac{\\partial v^{1}}{\\partial x^{3}} + \\alpha_{2}\\frac{\\partial v^{2}}{\\partial x^{3}} + \\alpha_{3}\\frac{\\partial v^{3}}{\\partial x^{3}})$\n$= (x^{2}(\\cos x^{1}) + x^{3}(0) + (-x^{1})(0)) + (((x^{1})^{2}+x^2)(0) + (x^2 x^3)(1) + (\\sin x^{1})(0)) = x^{2}\\cos(x^{1}) + x^{2}x^{3}$\n\nLet $\\beta = \\mathcal{L}_{v}\\alpha$. We evaluate the components of $\\beta$ at the point $x_{0} = (1, 0, -1)$:\n$\\beta_{1}(x_{0}) = 2(1)(0) + (-1) - \\sin(1) = -1 - \\sin(1)$\n$\\beta_{2}(x_{0}) = (-1)^{2} - (1)(0) + (1)^{2} + 0 = 1 + 1 = 2$\n$\\beta_{3}(x_{0}) = 0 \\cdot \\cos(1) + 0 \\cdot (-1) = 0$\nSo, $(\\mathcal{L}_{v}\\alpha)_{x_{0}} = (-1-\\sin(1))dx^{1} + 2dx^{2}$.\n\nWe then evaluate this $1$-form on the vector $w = (1, 1, 0)$ at $x_{0}$:\n$(\\mathcal{L}_{v}\\alpha)_{x_{0}}(w) = \\beta_{i}(x_{0})w^{i} = (-1-\\sin(1))(1) + (2)(1) + (0)(0) = -1 - \\sin(1) + 2 = 1 - \\sin(1)$\n\nFinally, we verify this result using the definition of the Lie derivative in terms of the flow $\\Phi_t$ of $v$:\n$$\n(\\mathcal{L}_{v}\\alpha)_{x_{0}}(w) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} (\\Phi_{t}^{*}\\alpha)_{x_{0}}(w)\n$$\nBy definition of the pullback, $(\\Phi_{t}^{*}\\alpha)_{x_{0}}(w) = \\alpha_{\\Phi_{t}(x_{0})}(d\\Phi_{t}|_{x_{0}}(w))$.\nFor small $t$, we can approximate the flow and its derivative:\n$\\Phi_{t}(x_{0}) \\approx x_{0} + t v(x_{0})$\n$d\\Phi_{t}|_{x_{0}}(w) \\approx (I + t \\nabla v(x_{0}))w = w + t (\\nabla v(x_{0}))w$\nwhere $I$ is the identity matrix.\n\nAt $x_{0} = (1, 0, -1)$, the velocity is $v(x_{0}) = (0, -1, -1)$.\nThe point along the flow is $\\Phi_{t}(x_{0}) \\approx (1, 0, -1) + t(0, -1, -1) = (1, -t, -1-t)$.\nThe pushed-forward vector is:\n$(\\nabla v(x_{0}))w = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\nSo, $d\\Phi_{t}|_{x_{0}}(w) \\approx \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + t\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1+t \\\\ 1 \\\\ -t \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nLet $x(t) = \\Phi_{t}(x_{0})$ and $w(t) = d\\Phi_{t}|_{x_{0}}(w)$. We evaluate $\\alpha_{x(t)}(w(t))$ to first order in $t$.\nThe components of $\\alpha$ at $x(t) \\approx (1, -t, -1-t)$ are:\n$\\alpha_{1}(x(t)) = (x^{1}(t))^{2} + x^{2}(t) = 1^{2} + (-t) = 1-t$\n$\\alpha_{2}(x(t)) = x^{2}(t)x^{3}(t) = (-t)(-1-t) = t+t^{2}$\n$\\alpha_{3}(x(t)) = \\sin(x^{1}(t)) = \\sin(1)$\n\nNow, we compute the contraction:\n$(\\Phi_{t}^{*}\\alpha)_{x_{0}}(w) = \\alpha_{i}(x(t))w^{i}(t) \\approx (1-t)(1+t) + (t+t^{2})(1) + (\\sin 1)(-t)$\n$= (1-t^{2}) + t + t^{2} - t\\sin(1) = 1 + t(1-\\sin(1))$\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to $t$ and evaluating at $t=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\left( 1 + t(1-\\sin(1)) \\right) = 1 - \\sin(1)\n$$\nThis result matches the one obtained using Cartan's formula, thus verifying the calculation.",
