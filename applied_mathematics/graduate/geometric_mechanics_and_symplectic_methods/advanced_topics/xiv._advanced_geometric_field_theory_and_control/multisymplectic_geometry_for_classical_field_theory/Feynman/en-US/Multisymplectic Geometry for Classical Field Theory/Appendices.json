Denote the first jet coordinates by $(x^{\\mu},\\phi,v_{\\mu})$, where $v_{\\mu}$ stands for the partial derivatives $v_{\\mu}=\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi$. Let $g_{\\mu\\nu}(x)$ be a smooth field of nondegenerate bilinear forms with inverse $g^{\\mu\\nu}(x)$ defined by $g^{\\mu\\alpha}g_{\\alpha\\nu}=\\delta^{\\mu}_{\\nu}$. Consider the Dirichlet energy Lagrangian function\n$$\nL(x,\\phi,v)=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\,g^{\\mu\\nu}(x)\\,v_{\\mu}\\,v_{\\nu}.\n$$\nIn the De Donder–Weyl multisymplectic formalism, the Legendre map is defined fiberwise by the multimomenta $p^{\\mu}=\\partial L/\\partial v_{\\mu}$. The Hessian of $L$ with respect to $v_{\\mu}$ is the matrix $W^{\\mu\\nu}=\\partial^{2}L/\\partial v_{\\mu}\\partial v_{\\nu}$.\n\nStarting from these definitions and without introducing any additional formulas beyond core definitions, do the following:\n\n1.

No numerical approximation is required.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is deemed valid, contingent upon a standard interpretation of the terminology within its physical and geometric context. We shall first clarify this interpretation before proceeding to the solution. The problem asks for calculations based on the Lagrangian $L = \\frac{1}{2}g^{\\mu\\nu}(x)v_{\\mu}v_{\\nu}$. This expression involves a contraction of the tensor $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ with the manifestly symmetric tensor $v_{\\mu}v_{\\nu}$. Any tensor can be decomposed into its symmetric and antisymmetric parts. Let $g^{\\mu\\nu} = g_S^{\\mu\\nu} + g_A^{\\mu\\nu}$, where $g_S^{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2}(g^{\\mu\\nu} + g^{\\nu\\mu})$ and $g_A^{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2}(g^{\\mu\\nu} - g^{\\nu\\mu})$. The contraction of an antisymmetric tensor with a symmetric tensor is identically zero. Thus, $g_A^{\\mu\\nu}v_{\\mu}v_{\\nu} = 0$, and the Lagrangian simplifies to $L = \\frac{1}{2}g_S^{\\mu\\nu}v_{\\mu}v_{\\nu}$. Consequently, all dynamics and derived quantities, such as the multimomenta and the Hessian, depend solely on the symmetric part of $g^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n\nThe problem defines $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ as the inverse of $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ and asks for a final answer in terms of $g_{\\mu\\nu}$. If $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ were not symmetric, its symmetric part $g_S^{\\mu\\nu}$ would not, in general, have an inverse simply related to $g_{\\mu\\nu}$. This would render the fourth task, as stated, intractable. The standard context for the Dirichlet energy is that of a scalar field on a manifold endowed with a Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian metric, which is by definition a symmetric tensor. The phrase \"nondegenerate bilinear form\" is thus interpreted in its common physical application as a symmetric, nondegenerate bilinear form (a metric tensor). We will therefore proceed under the standard and necessary assumption that $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ is symmetric, which implies its inverse $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is also symmetric.\n\nWe now address the four tasks presented in the problem.\n\n1.  **Computation of the Legendre map components $p^{\\mu}$**\n\nThe multimomenta $p^{\\mu}$ are defined as the partial derivatives of the Lagrangian $L$ with respect to the jet velocities $v_{\\mu}$. We employ the Einstein summation convention where repeated indices are summed over.\n$$\np^{\\mu} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v_{\\mu}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v_{\\mu}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\alpha\\beta} v_{\\alpha} v_{\\beta} \\right)\n$$\nThe components $g^{\\alpha\\beta}$ depend on $x$ but not on $v_{\\mu}$, so we can treat them as constants with respect to the differentiation. Applying the product rule for derivatives:\n$$\np^{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\alpha\\beta} \\left( \\frac{\\partial v_{\\alpha}}{\\partial v_{\\mu}} v_{\\beta} + v_{\\alpha} \\frac{\\partial v_{\\beta}}{\\partial v_{\\mu}} \\right)\n$$\nThe partial derivative of one velocity component with respect to another is the Kronecker delta: $\\frac{\\partial v_{\\alpha}}{\\partial v_{\\mu}} = \\delta^{\\mu}_{\\alpha}$.\n$$\np^{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\alpha\\beta} \\left( \\delta^{\\mu}_{\\alpha} v_{\\beta} + v_{\\alpha} \\delta^{\\mu}_{\\beta} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the substitution property of the Kronecker delta to contract the indices:\n$$\np^{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( g^{\\mu\\beta} v_{\\beta} + g^{\\alpha\\mu} v_{\\alpha} \\right)\n$$\nBased on our initial clarification, $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ is a symmetric tensor, so $g^{\\alpha\\mu} = g^{\\mu\\alpha}$. We can relabel the dummy summation index $\\alpha$ to $\\beta$ in the second term:\n$$\np^{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( g^{\\mu\\beta} v_{\\beta} + g^{\\mu\\beta} v_{\\beta} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 2 g^{\\mu\\beta} v_{\\beta} \\right) = g^{\\mu\\beta} v_{\\beta}\n$$\nTo align with the notation in the problem, we use $\\nu$ as the dummy index:\n$$\np^{\\mu} = g^{\\mu\\nu} v_{\\nu}\n$$\n\n2.  **Computation of the Hessian matrix $W^{\\mu\\nu}$**\n\nThe Hessian matrix $W^{\\mu\\nu}$ is defined as the second partial derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to the velocities, which is equivalent to the partial derivative of the multimomenta $p^{\\mu}$ with respect to $v_{\\nu}$.\n$$\nW^{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial v_{\\mu} \\partial v_{\\nu}} = \\frac{\\partial p^{\\mu}}{\\partial v_{\\nu}}\n$$\nUsing the result from the first part:\n$$\nW^{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v_{\\nu}} \\left( g^{\\mu\\alpha} v_{\\alpha} \\right)\n$$\nAgain, $g^{\\mu\\alpha}$ does not depend on the velocities.\n$$\nW^{\\mu\\nu} = g^{\\mu\\alpha} \\frac{\\partial v_{\\alpha}}{\\partial v_{\\nu}} = g^{\\mu\\alpha} \\delta^{\\nu}_{\\alpha}\n$$\nContracting with the Kronecker delta yields:\n$$\nW^{\\mu\\nu} = g^{\\mu\\nu}\n$$\n\n3.  **Regularity Conditions**\n\nThe Legendre map is defined as *regular* if the Hessian matrix $W^{\\mu\\nu}$ is invertible at every point. From our calculation, the Hessian is $W^{\\mu\\nu} = g^{\\mu\\nu}$. Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for the regularity of the Legendre map is that the matrix of components $g^{\\mu\\nu}(x)$ is invertible for all $x \\in X$. This is equivalent to the condition that its determinant is non-zero, $\\det(g^{\\mu\\nu}) \\neq 0$.\n\nThe problem states that $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is a field of *nondegenerate* bilinear forms, which by definition means the matrix $(g_{\\mu\\nu})$ is invertible. Since $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ is given as the inverse of $g_{\\mu\\nu}$, it must also be invertible. Thus, the regularity condition is satisfied by the problem's premises.\n\nThe Legendre map is *hyperregular* if it constitutes a fiber-wise diffeomorphism. The map is given by the linear transformation $p^{\\mu} = g^{\\mu\\nu}(x) v_{\\nu}$. For each fixed point $x$, this is a linear map between the fiber of velocities and the fiber of momenta. Since the matrix $g^{\\mu\\nu}(x)$ is invertible, this linear map is an isomorphism. As this holds for all points $x$, the Legendre map is a vector bundle isomorphism, which fulfills the condition for hyperregularity.\n\n4.  **Computation of the Inverse Legendre Map**\n\nWe seek to express $v_{\\mu}$ in terms of $p^{\\nu}$ and $g_{\\mu\\nu}$. We begin with the expression for the Legendre map:\n$$\np^{\\mu} = g^{\\mu\\nu} v_{\\nu}\n$$\nTo solve for $v_{\\nu}$, we utilize the inverse tensor $g_{\\sigma\\mu}$, which is defined by the property $g_{\\sigma\\mu}g^{\\mu\\nu} = \\delta^{\\nu}_{\\sigma}$. We contract both sides of the equation with $g_{\\sigma\\mu}$:\n$$\ng_{\\sigma\\mu} p^{\\mu} = g_{\\sigma\\mu} (g^{\\mu\\nu} v_{\\nu})\n$$\nBy associativity of tensor multiplication, the right-hand side becomes:\n$$\ng_{\\sigma\\mu} p^{\\mu} = (g_{\\sigma\\mu} g^{\\mu\\nu}) v_{\\nu} = \\delta^{\\nu}_{\\sigma} v_{\\nu}\n$$\nThe contraction of $v_{\\nu}$ with the Kronecker delta $\\delta^{\\nu}_{\\sigma}$ simply replaces the index $\\nu$ with $\\sigma$:\n$$\ng_{\\sigma\\mu} p^{\\mu} = v_{\\sigma}\n$$\nThus, we have $v_{\\sigma} = g_{\\sigma\\mu} p^{\\mu}$. To provide the answer in the requested index notation (an expression for $v_{\\mu}$ in terms of $p^{\\nu}$), we relabel the free index $\\sigma$ to $\\mu$ and the dummy summation index $\\mu$ to $\\nu$:\n$$\nv_{\\mu} = g_{\\mu\\nu} p^{\\nu}\n$$\nThis is the explicit closed-form expression for the inverse Legendre map.",

Schematically, if $\\delta_\\epsilon \\phi^\\alpha = R^{\\alpha}_A \\epsilon^A$ (where $R^{\\alpha}_A$ is some differential operator), the variation of the action is\n$$ \\delta_\\epsilon S = \\int_M \\mathcal{E}_\\alpha(\\phi) (R^\\alpha_A \\epsilon^A) d^n x = \\int_M ((R^\\alpha_A)^\\dagger \\mathcal{E}_\\alpha(\\phi)) \\epsilon^A d^n x $$\nwhere $(R^\\alpha_A)^\\dagger$ is the formal adjoint of $R^\\alpha_A$. Since this must vanish for all compactly supported $\\epsilon^A$, we have the Noether identity:\n$$ (R^\\alpha_A)^\\dagger \\mathcal{E}_\\alpha(\\phi) \\equiv 0 $$\nThis identity holds for any field configuration $\\phi$ (off-shell).\n\n**A.

Since the action is invariant under a gauge transformation $\\delta_\\epsilon \\phi$, its first variation $\\delta_\\epsilon S$ is zero. Consequently, any further variation of $\\delta_\\epsilon S$ must also be zero. Let's vary $\\delta_\\epsilon S$ with respect to an arbitrary perturbation $\\delta\\psi$:\n$$ \\delta_\\psi(\\delta_\\epsilon S) = \\delta_\\psi \\int_M \\left( \\mathcal{E}_\\alpha(\\phi) \\delta_\\epsilon\\phi^\\alpha \\right) d^n x = 0 $$\nThis yields\n$$ \\int_M \\left( (\\delta_\\psi \\mathcal{E}_\\alpha) \\delta_\\epsilon\\phi^\\alpha + \\mathcal{E}_\\alpha (\\delta_\\psi(\\delta_\\epsilon\\phi^\\alpha)) \\right) d^n x = 0 $$\nBy definition, $\\delta_\\psi \\mathcal{E}_\\alpha = J_{\\alpha\\beta} \\delta\\psi^\\beta$.

The Euler-Lagrange equations are derived by considering variations $\\delta\\phi$ with compact support within the interior of $M$. For such variations, $\\delta S' = \\delta S$. Thus, the Euler-Lagrange equations $\\mathcal{E}_\\alpha=0$ are unchanged by the addition of a boundary term to $L$.\nSince the Euler-Lagrange operator $\\mathcal{E}_\\alpha$ is unchanged, its linearization, the Hessian $J_{\\alpha\\beta}$, is also unchanged. The degeneracy of $J_{\\alpha\\beta}$ is an intrinsic consequence of the gauge symmetry and cannot be removed by such a modification. To remove the degeneracy, one must break the gauge symmetry, for instance by adding a non-invariant gauge-fixing term to the Lagrangian (e.g., a Faddeev-Popov term), which is not a boundary term. A strictly positive definite Hessian is incompatible with a gauge symmetry, as it would imply a unique stationary point, whereas gauge theories feature entire orbits of physically equivalent solutions.\n\n**Verdict on B: Incorrect**\n\n**C. In the multisymplectic covariant phase space, the multisymplectic current $\\omega$ evaluated on two gauge variations is generically nonzero but exact, which shows that the degeneracy of the presymplectic form $\\Omega_\\Sigma$ along gauge directions is a cohomological artifact unrelated to Noether identities.**\n\nThe degeneracy of the presymplectic form $\\Omega_\\Sigma$ is the geometric expression of the gauge symmetry on the space of solutions. A vector field $X_g$ on the space of fields corresponding to a gauge variation $\\delta_\\epsilon\\phi$ is a null direction of $\\Omega_\\Sigma$. This means that for any vector field $Y$ (representing any variation $\\delta\\psi$), we have $\\Omega_\\Sigma(X_g, Y) = \\int_\\Sigma i_Y i_{X_g} \\omega = 0$. This is a consequence of the fact that, on-shell, the contraction of $\\omega$ with a gauge variation is an exact form, i.e., $i_{X_g}\\omega = d\\alpha_\\epsilon$ for some $(n-1)$-form $\\alpha_\\epsilon$. The form $\\alpha_\\epsilon$ is related to the Noether current associated with the symmetry. The vanishing of the integral is then a consequence of Stokes' theorem and boundary conditions.\nThe claim that this relationship is a \"cohomological artifact unrelated to Noether identities\" is fundamentally flawed. The degeneracy of $\\Omega_\\Sigma$ and the Noether identities are two facets of the same underlying principle: gauge invariance. The exactness of $i_{X_g}\\omega$ on-shell is the manifestation of the Noether identities in the multisymplectic framework. It is not an artifact; it is the central geometric feature of a gauge theory.\n\n**Verdict on C: Incorrect**\n\n**D. In multisymplectic geometry, the presymplectic form $\\Omega_\\Sigma$ has null directions generated by gauge variations on shell, and the reduction by gauge equivalence (or imposition of gauge-fixing conditions) yields a nondegenerate symplectic structure on the reduced covariant phase space, mirroring the degeneracy of the Hessian along gauge directions.**\n\nThis statement provides an accurate summary of the covariant phase space approach to gauge theories.\n1.  *\"...the presymplectic form $\\Omega_\\Sigma$ has null directions generated by gauge variations on shell...\"*: As established in the analysis of A and C, gauge variations induce infinitesimal motions along gauge orbits, which are precisely the null directions of the presymplectic form on the space of solutions. This is correct.\n2.  *\"...the reduction by gauge equivalence (or imposition of gauge-fixing conditions) yields a nondegenerate symplectic structure on the reduced covariant phase space...\"*: The space of solutions is foliated by gauge orbits. The \"reduced covariant phase space\" is the space of these orbits, representing the space of physically distinct solutions. The presymplectic form $\\Omega_\\Sigma$ on the full space of solutions descends to a well-defined and non-degenerate symplectic form on this reduced space. This procedure is a version of symplectic (or, more accurately, presymplectic) reduction and is the geometric counterpart to imposing a gauge-fixing condition to select one representative from each gauge orbit. This is correct.\n3.  *\"...mirroring the degeneracy of the Hessian along gauge directions.\"*: This correctly links the two formalisms. The existence of null directions for $J_{\\alpha\\beta}$ (at the level of linearized equations) and the existence of null directions for $\\Omega_\\Sigma$ (at the level of the phase space of solutions) are parallel consequences of the same gauge symmetry. Reducing the phase space to make the symplectic form non-degenerate is conceptually equivalent to imposing constraints that make the linearized problem for perturbations have a unique solution (i.e., removing the zero-modes of the Hessian).\n\nThe statement correctly synthesizes the connection between the degeneracy of the Hessian, the degeneracy of the presymplectic form, and the process of reduction to an unconstrained physical phase space.\n\n**Verdict on D: Correct**",
