## Introduction
Classical field theory, the language of modern physics, describes phenomena from electromagnetism to general relativity. While effective, traditional formulations often lack manifest [spacetime covariance](@entry_id:1132006), treating time as a special coordinate. To overcome this and provide a more profound, unified description, [geometric mechanics](@entry_id:169959) introduces the powerful framework of [multisymplectic geometry](@entry_id:1128349) on jet bundles. This approach provides a coordinate-independent language that reveals the deep geometric structures underlying the laws of physics.

This article offers a comprehensive exploration of this elegant formalism. It addresses the need for a geometric arena that can simultaneously handle field values and their derivatives, and it demonstrates how this foundation unifies the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian perspectives in a fully covariant way. Across three chapters, you will gain a robust understanding of both the theory and its practical power. The first chapter, **"Principles and Mechanisms,"** constructs the mathematical bedrock, introducing first jet bundles, the Poincaré-Cartan form, and the De Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian formalism. The second, **"Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections,"** showcases the framework's utility by reformulating fundamental field equations, deriving conservation laws, and tackling gauge theories. Finally, **"Hands-On Practices"** provides opportunities to apply these concepts through targeted exercises, solidifying your command of the material.

## Principles and Mechanisms

In our exploration of [classical field theory](@entry_id:149475), the geometric framework provides a language of unparalleled precision and depth. Having introduced the fundamental motivations, we now delve into the principles and mechanisms that form the mathematical bedrock of this approach. Our journey begins with the construction of the proper kinematic arena for first-order field theories—the first [jet bundle](@entry_id:158903)—and proceeds to the development of the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms upon this stage.

### The Geometric Arena: First Jet Bundles

A classical field is mathematically described as a section of a [fiber bundle](@entry_id:153776) $\pi: E \to M$, where $M$ is the base manifold (spacetime) and $E$ is the total space of field configurations. A first-order field theory is one whose physical laws depend not only on the field values but also on their first [partial derivatives](@entry_id:146280). To accommodate this, we must work on a space that encodes both pieces of information simultaneously. This space is the **first [jet bundle](@entry_id:158903)**, denoted $J^1E$.

An element of $J^1E$, called a **1-jet** of a section at a point $x \in M$, is an [equivalence class](@entry_id:140585) of local sections that have the same value and the same first [partial derivatives](@entry_id:146280) at $x$. It captures the first-order Taylor expansion of a field at a point in a coordinate-independent manner. If $(x^\mu)$ are local coordinates on an open set of the $n$-dimensional base manifold $M$ and $(y^i)$ are fiber coordinates, then a section $\sigma: M \to E$ is locally given by functions $y^i = \sigma^i(x^\mu)$. The 1-jet of $\sigma$ at $x$ is then determined by the values $(x^\mu, \sigma^i(x), \frac{\partial \sigma^i}{\partial x^\mu}(x))$. These values serve as natural local coordinates on $J^1E$, which we write as $(x^\mu, y^i, y^i_\mu)$.

Given any smooth section $\sigma: M \to E$, we can lift it to a section of the [jet bundle](@entry_id:158903), called the **first jet prolongation** of $\sigma$, denoted $j^1\sigma: M \to J^1E$. This map is defined by sending each point $x \in M$ to the 1-jet of $\sigma$ at that point, $j^1\sigma(x) = j^1_x\sigma$. In local coordinates, this means the coordinate functions on $J^1E$ are related to the section $\sigma$ by:
$$ y^i \circ j^1\sigma = \sigma^i(x) \quad \text{and} \quad y^i_\mu \circ j^1\sigma = \frac{\partial \sigma^i}{\partial x^\mu}(x) $$
This relation makes explicit how the abstract coordinates $y^i_\mu$ on the [jet bundle](@entry_id:158903) correspond to the concrete partial derivatives of a physical field .

The [jet bundle](@entry_id:158903) has two important projections: $\pi_1: J^1E \to M$ which projects a jet to its base point $x$, and $\pi_{1,0}: J^1E \to E$ which projects a jet $j^1_x\sigma$ to its value $\sigma(x)$. The structure of the fibers of these projections is crucial. While the fiber of $\pi_1$ over a point $x \in M$ is a complicated space, the fiber of $\pi_{1,0}$ over a point $e \in E$ has a beautiful and simple structure. Let $x = \pi(e)$. All jets in this fiber share the same value $e$ but have different first derivatives. The difference between the tangent maps of two such jets is a [linear map](@entry_id:201112) from the [tangent space](@entry_id:141028) of the base, $T_xM$, to the vertical subspace of the tangent space of the total space, $V_eE = \ker(d\pi_e) \subset T_eE$. This means that the set of all 1-jets over a point $e \in E$ forms an **affine space** modeled on the vector space $L(T_xM, V_eE)$, which is isomorphic to $T_x^*M \otimes V_eE$.

This affine structure, rather than a vector space structure, is a defining feature of jet bundles. The non-existence of a canonical "[zero derivative](@entry_id:145492)" jet is revealed by the coordinate transformation law for $y^i_\mu$. Under a change of fibered coordinates from $(x^\mu, y^i)$ to $(x'^\nu, y'^j)$, the jet coordinates transform according to the [chain rule](@entry_id:147422) :
$$ y'^j_\nu = \frac{\partial x^\mu}{\partial x'^\nu} \left( \frac{\partial y'^j}{\partial y^i} y^i_\mu + \frac{\partial y'^j}{\partial x^\mu} \right) $$
The presence of the inhomogeneous term $\frac{\partial y'^j}{\partial x^\mu}$ confirms that the "zero" condition $y^i_\mu = 0$ is not preserved under general coordinate changes, precluding a canonical vector space structure for the fibers of $J^1E \to M$.

### Characterizing Holonomicity: The Contact Structure

The image of a jet prolongation, $j^1\sigma(M) \subset J^1E$, is an $n$-dimensional submanifold that satisfies the special property that its "derivative" components $y^i_\mu$ are indeed the derivatives of its "value" components $y^i$ with respect to the base coordinates $x^\mu$. Such submanifolds are called **holonomic**. A central task of the geometric formalism is to find an intrinsic way to characterize these holonomic submanifolds.

This is accomplished by the **contact [1-forms](@entry_id:157984)**, defined in local coordinates as:
$$ \theta^i = dy^i - y^i_\mu dx^\mu $$
These forms are designed to measure the "non-holonomicity" of directions within the [jet bundle](@entry_id:158903). Their fundamental property, which serves as their very definition of purpose, is that they vanish identically when pulled back to a holonomic submanifold . If we compute the [pullback](@entry_id:160816) $(j^1\sigma)^*\theta^i$ for any section $\sigma$, we find:
$$ (j^1\sigma)^*\theta^i = (j^1\sigma)^*(dy^i - y^i_\mu dx^\mu) = d(\sigma^i(x)) - \left(\frac{\partial \sigma^i}{\partial x^\mu}\right) dx^\mu = \left(\frac{\partial \sigma^i}{\partial x^\nu}\right) dx^\nu - \left(\frac{\partial \sigma^i}{\partial x^\mu}\right) dx^\mu = 0 $$
Conversely, a version of the Frobenius theorem adapted to jet bundles states that any $n$-dimensional [submanifold](@entry_id:262388) $S \subset J^1E$ on which the contact forms vanish (i.e., $\theta^i|_{TS} = 0$) and which projects diffeomorphically onto the base manifold $M$ is, at least locally, the jet prolongation of some section $\sigma: M \to E$ . The contact forms thus provide a complete and elegant criterion for holonomicity.

It is important to note that the collection of forms $\{\theta^i\}$ spans a well-defined subbundle of $T^*(J^1E)$, but the individual forms $\theta^i$ are coordinate-dependent. Furthermore, their exterior derivatives are non-zero:
$$ d\theta^i = d(dy^i - y^i_\mu dx^\mu) = -dy^i_\mu \wedge dx^\mu $$
This non-vanishing [exterior derivative](@entry_id:161900) is a hallmark of contact geometry and is essential for the construction of multisymplectic forms.

### The Lagrangian Formalism and the Poincaré-Cartan Form

With the geometry of $J^1E$ established, we can formulate Lagrangian [field theory](@entry_id:155241). A first-order Lagrangian is a function $L(x^\mu, y^i, y^i_\mu)$ on $J^1E$. When paired with a [volume form](@entry_id:161784) on the base manifold, $\eta \in \Omega^n(M)$, it forms the **Lagrangian $n$-form** $\mathcal{L} = L\eta$. The dynamics of the system are found by seeking sections $\sigma$ that extremize the [action functional](@entry_id:169216) $S[\sigma] = \int_M (j^1\sigma)^*\mathcal{L}$.

In the geometric formalism, the variational principle is encoded by the **Poincaré-Cartan $n$-form**, $\Theta_L$, an $n$-form on $J^1E$. Its defining characteristic is that its pullback along a jet prolongation recovers the original Lagrangian form. A coordinate-invariant expression for $\Theta_L$ is given by :
$$ \Theta_L = \frac{\partial L}{\partial y^i_\mu} \theta^i \wedge \eta_\mu + L\eta $$
Here, $\eta_\mu$ is the $(n-1)$-form defined by contracting the [volume form](@entry_id:161784) $\eta$ with the [basis vector](@entry_id:199546) field $\partial/\partial x^\mu$, i.e., $\eta_\mu = i_{\partial/\partial x^\mu}\eta$. Since $(j^1\sigma)^*\theta^i = 0$, it is immediately clear that $(j^1\sigma)^*\Theta_L = L\eta$, satisfying the defining requirement.

By substituting the definition of the contact forms, $\theta^i = dy^i - y^i_\nu dx^\nu$, and using the algebraic identity $dx^\nu \wedge \eta_\mu = \delta^\nu_\mu \eta$, we can rewrite $\Theta_L$ in a different, equally important form :
$$ \Theta_L = \frac{\partial L}{\partial y^i_\mu} dy^i \wedge \eta_\mu + \left(L - y^i_\mu \frac{\partial L}{\partial y^i_\mu}\right) \eta $$
This second expression is suggestive, revealing a structure analogous to the Cartan form $p\,dq - H\,dt$ of classical mechanics. The term multiplying the "kinetic" part $dy^i \wedge \eta_\mu$ is recognizable as the momentum, and the term multiplying the [volume form](@entry_id:161784) $\eta$ is a precursor to the field-theoretic Hamiltonian density.

The exterior derivative of the Poincaré-Cartan form, $\Omega_L = -d\Theta_L$, defines the **Lagrangian multisymplectic form**. This $(n+1)$-form on $J^1E$ geometrically encodes the Euler-Lagrange equations of the theory.

### The Hamiltonian Formalism: Multimomentum Bundles and Regularity

The transition to a Hamiltonian description is mediated by the **fiber Legendre map**, $\mathbb{F}L$. This map takes a point on the Lagrangian side (in $J^1E$) to a point on the Hamiltonian side, which lies in the **multimomentum bundle** (or dual [jet bundle](@entry_id:158903)), denoted $J^1E^*$. In [local coordinates](@entry_id:181200), this map is defined by introducing the **polymomenta** $p^\mu_i$:
$$ \mathbb{F}L: (x^\mu, y^i, y^i_\mu) \mapsto (x^\mu, y^i, p^\mu_i) \quad \text{where} \quad p^\mu_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial y^i_\mu} $$
For this map to be invertible, allowing us to express the velocities $y^i_\mu$ in terms of the momenta $p^\mu_i$, the Lagrangian must satisfy a regularity condition. A Lagrangian $L$ is called **regular** if the Hessian matrix of second derivatives with respect to the jet variables, $W_{(i\mu)(j\nu)} = \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial y^i_\mu \partial y^j_\nu}$, is non-degenerate (invertible) at every point . By the [inverse function theorem](@entry_id:138570), regularity ensures that $\mathbb{F}L$ is a [local diffeomorphism](@entry_id:203529). A stronger condition, **hyperregularity**, is met if $\mathbb{F}L$ is a global [diffeomorphism](@entry_id:147249), which typically requires additional global assumptions on $L$, such as [injectivity](@entry_id:147722) and properness of the map .

If the regularity condition fails, the Lagrangian is said to be **degenerate**. In this case, the Legendre map is not invertible, and the image of $\mathbb{F}L$ is a submanifold of the multimomentum bundle defined by one or more **[constraint equations](@entry_id:138140)**. For instance, the simple but degenerate Lagrangian $L = \frac{1}{2}(y^1_0+y^2_0)^2$, where $y^i_0$ are velocity components, has a singular Hessian. Its Legendre map gives momenta $p^1_0 = y^1_0+y^2_0$ and $p^2_0 = y^1_0+y^2_0$, which forces them to live on the constraint surface defined by $\varphi(p^1_0, p^2_0) = p^1_0-p^2_0=0$ . The study of such [constrained systems](@entry_id:164587) is a rich topic in its own right.

Assuming hyperregularity, we can work on the multimomentum bundle $J^1E^*$. This space can be equivalently described as the bundle of affine maps from $J^1E$ to the space of $n$-forms on $M$, or as a subbundle of the [exterior algebra](@entry_id:201164) bundle $\Lambda^n T^*E$ . On this space, we can define the **De Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian function** $H$ via the Legendre transform:
$$ H(x^\mu, y^i, p^\mu_i) = p^\mu_i y^i_\mu - L(x^\mu, y^i, y^i_\mu) $$
where the $y^i_\mu$ are understood to be expressed as functions of $(x, y, p)$ using the inverse Legendre map .

### Multisymplectic Geometry and Equations of Motion

The true power of the Hamiltonian formalism lies in the canonical geometric structure of the multimomentum bundle. This structure is that of an **$n$-plectic manifold**. An $n$-plectic manifold is a pair $(P, \Omega)$ consisting of a manifold $P$ and a differential $(n+1)$-form $\Omega$ that is both **closed** ($d\Omega=0$) and **non-degenerate** .

The non-degeneracy condition is crucial. It means that for any point $p \in P$, the [linear map](@entry_id:201112) from the tangent space to the space of $n$-[covectors](@entry_id:157727), defined by the [interior product](@entry_id:158127) $v \mapsto i_v\Omega_p$, is injective. This is a generalization of the non-degeneracy of a symplectic 2-form, which requires this map to be an [isomorphism](@entry_id:137127). For $n > 1$, the dimensions of the domain ($ \dim(T_pP) $) and [codomain](@entry_id:139336) ($ \binom{\dim(T_pP)}{n} $) generally do not match, so [injectivity](@entry_id:147722) is the appropriate generalization .

For a first-order field theory, the multimomentum bundle $J^1E^*$ is endowed with a canonical $(n+1)$-form $\Omega$ that makes it an $n$-plectic manifold. This form, often called the **canonical multisymplectic form**, can be derived from a potential (a canonical $n$-form $\Theta$) and is given in [local coordinates](@entry_id:181200) by:
$$ \Omega = dy^i \wedge dp^\mu_i \wedge \eta_\mu $$
(summation over all repeated indices is implied). This form is exact by construction (if derived from a potential), so it is automatically closed ($d\Omega = 0$). It is a fundamental result that this form is also non-degenerate, making $(J^1E^*, \Omega)$ the canonical $n$-plectic phase space for the [field theory](@entry_id:155241) .

The dynamics of the theory are elegantly captured by the multisymplectic version of Hamilton's equations. These can be derived in two equivalent ways. One approach is to apply the [variational principle](@entry_id:145218) to the Hamiltonian action $S_H = \int (p^\mu_i \partial_\mu y^i - H) d^nx$. Varying with respect to $y^i$ and $p^\mu_i$ as independent fields yields the **De Donder-Weyl equations** :
$$ \frac{\partial y^i}{\partial x^\mu} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p^\mu_i} \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{\mu=1}^n \frac{\partial p^\mu_i}{\partial x^\mu} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial y^i} $$
A more profound geometric derivation comes from the equation $i_{X_H}\Omega = dH$, where $X_H$ is a special, decomposable vector field on $J^1E^*$ called the Hamiltonian [multivector](@entry_id:203525) field. Solving this equation for the components of $X_H$ and identifying them with derivatives of the fields leads to the same set of De Donder-Weyl equations . This purely algebraic derivation on the phase space demonstrates the deep connection between the Hamiltonian function, the multisymplectic form, and the equations of motion.

### Connection to Standard Symplectic Mechanics

The abstract nature of the multisymplectic framework can be made concrete by examining the special case where the base manifold has dimension $n=1$. This recovers the familiar setting of time-dependent classical mechanics. Let the base coordinate be $t$ and the fiber coordinates be $q^i$. The jet coordinates are $(t, q^i, v^i)$, where $v^i = \dot{q}^i$. The polymomenta have only one component, $p^i_1$, which we write as $p_i$. The multimomentum bundle $J^1E^*$ becomes the extended phase space $\mathbb{R} \times T^*Q$ with coordinates $(t, q^i, p_i)$.

In this $n=1$ case, the Poincaré-Cartan form on the phase space becomes the familiar Cartan [1-form](@entry_id:275851) :
$$ \Theta = p_i dq^i - H dt $$
The multisymplectic $(1+1=2)$-form $\Omega = -d\Theta$ is then:
$$ \Omega = dp_i \wedge dq^i + dH \wedge dt $$
(Note the sign difference with some conventions, which is a matter of definition). If we restrict this 2-form to a surface of constant time, $t=t_0$, the $dt$ term vanishes. The pullback of $\Omega$ to this time slice is precisely the **canonical symplectic 2-form** on [the cotangent bundle](@entry_id:185138) $T^*Q$:
$$ \omega_0 = dp_i \wedge dq^i $$
The fundamental property that the multisymplectic form is closed ($d\Omega=0$) now has a clear physical meaning. It implies that the Hamiltonian flow, which describes the [time evolution](@entry_id:153943) of the system, preserves the symplectic form $\omega_0$. This is the geometric statement of conservation of the symplectic structure, a cornerstone of Hamiltonian mechanics. The multisymplectic formalism is thus a natural and powerful generalization of the symplectic geometry of classical mechanics to the realm of [classical field theory](@entry_id:149475).
