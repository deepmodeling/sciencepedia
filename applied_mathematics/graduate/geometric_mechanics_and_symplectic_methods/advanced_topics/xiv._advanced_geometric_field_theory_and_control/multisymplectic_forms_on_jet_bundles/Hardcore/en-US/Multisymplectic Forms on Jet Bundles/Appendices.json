A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested by the problem statement. First, we derive the necessary identity, and second, we use this identity to simplify the given differential form `\\Phi`.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the identity `dx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\nu} = \\delta^{\\mu}_{\\nu}\\eta`**\n\nThe volume `n`-form on `X` is `\\eta = dx^{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{n}`. The `(n-1)`-forms `\\eta_{\\nu}` are defined by `\\eta_{\\nu} = \\iota_{\\partial/\\partial x^{\\nu}}\\eta`. To find an explicit expression for `\\eta_{\\nu}`, we apply the graded Leibniz rule for the interior product `\\iota_{v}(\\alpha \\wedge \\beta) = (\\iota_{v}\\alpha) \\wedge \\beta + (-1)^{\\deg\\alpha}\\alpha \\wedge \\iota_{v}\\beta` to `\\eta`. Since each `dx^{k}` is a `1`-form, a more general rule for a product of `1`-forms `\\alpha_j` is `\\iota_v(\\alpha_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\alpha_n) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^{k-1} \\alpha_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\iota_v(\\alpha_k) \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\alpha_n`.\n\nApplying this to `\\eta_{\\nu} = \\iota_{\\partial/\\partial x^{\\nu}}(dx^{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{n})`:\n$$\n\\eta_{\\nu} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^{k-1} dx^{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\iota_{\\partial/\\partial x^{\\nu}}(dx^{k}) \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{n}\n$$\nUsing the given identity `\\iota_{\\partial/\\partial x^{\\nu}}(dx^{k}) = \\delta^{k}_{\\nu}`, the sum collapses to a single term where `k=\\nu`:\n$$\n\\eta_{\\nu} = (-1)^{\\nu-1} dx^{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge (\\delta^{\\nu}_{\\nu}) \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{n}\n$$\nHere, `\\delta^{\\nu}_{\\nu} = 1` and the term `dx^{\\nu}` is removed from the wedge product. So, `\\eta_{\\nu}` is the `(n-1)`-form:\n$$\n\\eta_{\\nu} = (-1)^{\\nu-1} dx^{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{\\nu-1} \\wedge dx^{\\nu+1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{n}\n$$\nNow we compute the wedge product `dx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\nu}`. We consider two cases.\n\nCase 1: `\\mu \\neq \\nu`.\nIn this case, the `1`-form `dx^{\\mu}` is already a factor in the expansion of `\\eta_{\\nu}` (since `\\mu` is one of the indices from `1` to `n` but is not `\\nu`). Taking the wedge product of `dx^{\\mu}` with `\\eta_{\\nu}` results in `dx^{\\mu}` appearing twice. Since `dx^{\\mu} \\wedge dx^{\\mu} = 0` for any `1`-form, we have:\n$$\ndx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\nu} = 0 \\quad (\\text{for } \\mu \\neq \\nu)\n$$\nThis matches the right-hand side of the identity, `\\delta^{\\mu}_{\\nu}\\eta = 0 \\cdot \\eta = 0`.\n\nCase 2: `\\mu = \\nu`.\nWe compute `dx^{\\nu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\nu}`:\n$$\ndx^{\\nu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\nu} = dx^{\\nu} \\wedge \\left( (-1)^{\\nu-1} dx^{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{\\nu-1} \\wedge dx^{\\nu+1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{n} \\right)\n$$\nTo reorder the terms to form `\\eta`, we must move `dx^{\\nu}` from the front to its original position between `dx^{\\nu-1}` and `dx^{\\nu+1}`. This requires commuting `dx^{\\nu}` past `\\nu-1` one-forms (`dx^{1}, \\dots, dx^{\\nu-1}`). Each commutation of two `1`-forms introduces a factor of `-1`.\n$$\ndx^{\\nu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\nu} = (-1)^{\\nu-1} (-1)^{\\nu-1} dx^{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{\\nu-1} \\wedge dx^{\\nu} \\wedge dx^{\\nu+1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{n}\n$$\nSince `(-1)^{\\nu-1} (-1)^{\\nu-1} = (-1)^{2(\\nu-1)} = 1`, this simplifies to:\n$$\ndx^{\\nu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\nu} = dx^{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{n} = \\eta \\quad (\\text{for } \\mu = \\nu)\n$$\nThis matches the right-hand side of the identity, `\\delta^{\\nu}_{\\nu}\\eta = 1 \\cdot \\eta = \\eta`.\n\nCombining both cases, we have proven the identity `dx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\nu} = \\delta^{\\mu}_{\\nu}\\eta`.\n\n**Part 2: Simplification of the form `\\Phi`**\n\nThe given form is `\\Phi = \\sum_{\\mu,\\nu=1}^{n} A_{\\mu\\nu}\\,dx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\nu} + \\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\sum_{\\mu=1}^{n} B_{i}^{\\mu}\\,dy^{i} \\wedge dx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\mu}`. We simplify each of the two terms separately.\n\nSimplification of the first term:\nLet the first term be `\\Phi_{1} = \\sum_{\\mu,\\nu=1}^{n} A_{\\mu\\nu}\\,dx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\nu}`. We apply the identity derived above:\n$$\n\\Phi_{1} = \\sum_{\\mu,\\nu=1}^{n} A_{\\mu\\nu} (\\delta^{\\mu}_{\\nu}\\eta)\n$$\nThe Kronecker delta `\\delta^{\\mu}_{\\nu}` is non-zero only when `\\nu = \\mu`. Thus, we can collapse the summation over `\\nu`:\n$$\n\\Phi_{1} = \\sum_{\\mu=1}^{n} A_{\\mu\\mu}\\eta = \\left(\\sum_{\\mu=1}^{n} A_{\\mu\\mu}\\right) \\eta\n$$\nThe sum `\\sum_{\\mu=1}^{n} A_{\\mu\\mu}` is the trace of the matrix `A` whose components are `A_{\\mu\\nu}`.\n\nSimplification of the second term:\nLet the second term be `\\Phi_{2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\sum_{\\mu=1}^{n} B_{i}^{\\mu}\\,dy^{i} \\wedge dx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\mu}`.\nConsider the wedge product `dy^{i} \\wedge dx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\mu}`. The wedge product is associative, so we can group it as `dy^{i} \\wedge (dx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\mu})`. We apply the identity `dx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\nu} = \\delta^{\\mu}_{\\nu}\\eta` with `\\nu=\\mu`:\n$$\ndx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\mu} = \\delta^{\\mu}_{\\mu}\\eta = 1 \\cdot \\eta = \\eta\n$$\nNote that this identity `dx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\mu} = \\eta` holds for each individual index `\\mu` from `1` to `n`. Substituting this into the expression for `\\Phi_2`:\n$$\ndy^{i} \\wedge dx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\mu} = dy^{i} \\wedge \\eta\n$$\nThe term `dy^{i} \\wedge \\eta` is independent of the summation index `\\mu`. So we can write `\\Phi_{2}` as:\n$$\n\\Phi_{2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\sum_{\\mu=1}^{n} B_{i}^{\\mu} (dy^{i} \\wedge \\eta)\n$$\nWe can rearrange the summations and factor out the form `dy^{i} \\wedge \\eta`, which is constant with respect to the sum over `\\mu`:\n$$\n\\Phi_{2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left( \\sum_{\\mu=1}^{n} B_{i}^{\\mu} \\right) dy^{i} \\wedge \\eta\n$$\n\nCombining the simplified parts `\\Phi_{1}` and `\\Phi_{2}`, we obtain the final expression for `\\Phi`:\n$$\n\\Phi = \\Phi_{1} + \\Phi_{2} = \\left(\\sum_{\\mu=1}^{n} A_{\\mu\\mu}\\right) \\eta + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left(\\sum_{\\mu=1}^{n} B_{i}^{\\mu}\\right) dy^{i} \\wedge \\eta\n$$\nThis is the simplified closed-form analytic expression for `\\Phi` in terms of `\\eta` and `dy^{i} \\wedge \\eta`, with coefficients constructed from the given constants `A_{\\mu\\nu}` and `B_{i}^{\\mu}`.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, containing all necessary information for a unique and meaningful solution. It is a standard exercise in the geometric formulation of classical field theory. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is structured in three parts: first, the derivation of the symplectic current $j^{\\mu}$; second, the verification of its conservation; and third, the calculation of the symplectic flux for specific solutions.\n\nWe begin by establishing the geometric framework. The configuration space is the trivial line bundle $Y = M \\times \\mathbb{R} \\to M$, where $M = \\mathbb{R}^{1+n}$ is Minkowski spacetime with coordinates $x^{\\mu}$ for $\\mu \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ and metric $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ with signature $(-, +, \\dots, +)$. The fiber coordinate is $\\phi$. The first jet bundle $J^{1}Y$ has local coordinates $(x^{\\mu}, \\phi, \\phi_{\\mu})$, where $\\phi_{\\mu}$ represent the partial derivatives $\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi$.\n\nThe Lagrangian density is given by\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(\\phi, \\phi_{\\mu}) = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{\\mu \\nu} \\phi_{\\mu} \\phi_{\\nu} - \\frac{1}{2} m^{2} \\phi^{2}\n$$\nThe canonical momenta are defined as $p^{\\mu} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\phi_{\\mu}}$. For the given Lagrangian, this yields\n$$\np^{\\mu} = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{\\alpha \\beta} \\frac{\\partial(\\phi_{\\alpha}\\phi_{\\beta})}{\\partial \\phi_{\\mu}} = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{\\alpha \\beta} (\\delta_{\\alpha}^{\\mu}\\phi_{\\beta} + \\phi_{\\alpha}\\delta_{\\beta}^{\\mu}) = -g^{\\mu \\beta}\\phi_{\\beta} = -\\phi^{\\mu}\n$$\nThe Poincaré–Cartan $n$-form $\\theta$ on $J^{1}Y$ can be defined as $\\theta = p^{\\mu} d\\phi \\wedge d^{n}x_{\\mu}$, where $d^{n}x_{\\mu} = \\iota_{\\partial_{\\mu}} d^{n+1}x$ is the interior product of the volume form $d^{n+1}x = dx^{0} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^{n}$ with the coordinate vector field $\\partial_{\\mu}$.

We compute the divergence directly:\n$$\n\\partial_{\\mu}j^{\\mu} = \\partial_{\\mu} \\left( \\delta_{1}\\phi \\, \\partial^{\\mu}(\\delta_{2}\\phi) - \\delta_{2}\\phi \\, \\partial^{\\mu}(\\delta_{1}\\phi) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\partial_{\\mu}j^{\\mu} = (\\partial_{\\mu}\\delta_{1}\\phi)(\\partial^{\\mu}\\delta_{2}\\phi) + \\delta_{1}\\phi (\\partial_{\\mu}\\partial^{\\mu}\\delta_{2}\\phi) - (\\partial_{\\mu}\\delta_{2}\\phi)(\\partial^{\\mu}\\delta_{1}\\phi) - \\delta_{2}\\phi (\\partial_{\\mu}\\partial^{\\mu}\\delta_{1}\\phi)\n$$\nThe first and third terms cancel. Using the definition of the d'Alembertian operator $\\Box = \\partial_{\\mu}\\partial^{\\mu}$, we are left with\n$$\n\\partial_{\\mu}j^{\\mu} = \\delta_{1}\\phi (\\Box\\delta_{2}\\phi) - \\delta_{2}\\phi (\\Box\\delta_{1}\\phi)\n$$\nThe variations $\\delta_{1}\\phi$ and $\\delta_{2}\\phi$ are solutions to the linearized Klein-Gordon equation about the zero solution. The Euler-Lagrange equation is $(-\\Box+m^2)\\phi=0$. Its linearization at $\\phi=0$ is $(-\\Box+m^2)\\delta\\phi=0$, or $\\Box\\delta\\phi=m^2\\delta\\phi$. Substituting this into the expression for the divergence yields:\n$$\n\\partial_{\\mu}j^{\\mu} = \\delta_{1}\\phi (m^{2}\\delta_{2}\\phi) - \\delta_{2}\\phi (m^{2}\\delta_{1}\\phi) = m^{2}(\\delta_{1}\\phi\\,\\delta_{2}\\phi - \\delta_{2}\\phi\\,\\delta_{1}\\phi) = 0\n$$\nThe conservation is thus verified. This result is a consequence of the underlying geometric structure; the identity $d\\omega=0$ implies that the current is conserved for fields satisfying the equations of motion.\n\nFor the final part, we compute the conserved symplectic flux $\\Omega_{\\Sigma}$ through a constant-time Cauchy surface $\\Sigma_{t} = \\{x^0=t=\\text{const}\\}$. The future-pointing unit normal vector is $n^{\\mu}=(1,0,\\dots,0)$. The corresponding covector has components $n_{\\mu} = g_{\\mu\\nu}n^{\\nu} = (-1,0,\\dots,0)$. The surface integration element is $d\\Sigma = d^{n}x$. The flux is\n$$\n\\Omega_{\\Sigma}(\\delta_{1}\\phi,\\delta_{2}\\phi) = \\int_{\\Sigma_{t}} j^{\\mu} n_{\\mu} \\, d^{n}x = \\int_{\\Sigma_{t}} j^{0} n_{0} \\, d^{n}x = \\int_{\\Sigma_{t}} (-j^{0}) \\, d^{n}x\n$$\nThe time component of the current is $j^{0} = \\delta_{1}\\phi\\,\\partial^{0}(\\delta_{2}\\phi) - \\delta_{2}\\phi\\,\\partial^{0}(\\delta_{1}\\phi)$. With the metric signature $(-, +, \\dots, +)$, $\\partial^{0} = g^{0\\nu}\\partial_{\\nu} = g^{00}\\partial_{0} = -\\partial_{0}$.

This exercise  explores the structure of degeneracy through a simple but powerful example. You will analyze the system from two perspectives: the geometric viewpoint on the jet bundle, where degeneracy appears as the kernel of the presymplectic form $\\Omega_L$, and the Hamiltonian viewpoint on phase space, where it manifests as Dirac constraints. By calculating the dimension of the kernel and classifying the constraints, you will uncover the profound correspondence between these two fundamental approaches to constrained dynamical systems.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of a degenerate Lagrangian system, $L = q^{2} v^{1}$, from two perspectives: the presymplectic formalism on the jet bundle and the constrained Hamiltonian formalism on the cotangent bundle.\n\n### Task 1: Presymplectic Analysis on $J^{1}E$\n\nFirst, we compute the Poincaré–Cartan $1$-form, $\\Theta_{L}$. The base manifold is one-dimensional, so the Einstein summation convention applies to the fiber indices $A \\in \\{1, 2\\}$. The Lagrangian is given by $L = q^{2}v^{1}$.\n\nThe partial derivatives of $L$ with respect to the jet velocities $v^{A}$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v^{1}} = q^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v^{2}} = 0\n$$\n\nThe Poincaré–Cartan $1$-form is defined as:\n$$\n\\Theta_{L} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v^{A}} \\, dq^{A} - \\left( L - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v^{A}} \\, v^{A} \\right) dt\n$$\nLet's compute the two terms separately. The first term is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v^{A}} \\, dq^{A} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v^{1}} \\, dq^{1} + \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v^{2}} \\, dq^{2} = q^{2} \\, dq^{1} + 0 \\cdot dq^{2} = q^{2} \\, dq^{1}\n$$\nThe second term, within the parentheses, is the Cartan Hamiltonian function $H_{L}$:\n$$\nH_{L} = L - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v^{A}} \\, v^{A} = (q^{2}v^{1}) - \\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v^{1}} v^{1} + \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v^{2}} v^{2}\\right) = q^{2}v^{1} - (q^{2} \\cdot v^{1} + 0 \\cdot v^{2}) = 0\n$$\nSince $H_{L} = 0$, the Poincaré–Cartan form simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Theta_{L} = q^{2} \\, dq^{1}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the presymplectic $2$-form $\\Omega_{L}$ by taking the negative exterior derivative of $\\Theta_{L}$:\n$$\n\\Omega_{L} = - d\\Theta_{L} = - d(q^{2} \\, dq^{1})\n$$\nUsing the product rule for exterior derivatives, $d(f \\omega) = df \\wedge \\omega + f \\, d\\omega$, and noting that $d(dq^{1}) = 0$:\n$$\n\\Omega_{L} = - (d(q^{2}) \\wedge dq^{1} + q^{2} \\, d(dq^{1})) = - (dq^{2} \\wedge dq^{1})\n$$\nUsing the anticommutativity of the wedge product, $dq^{2} \\wedge dq^{1} = - dq^{1} \\wedge dq^{2}$, we get:\n$$\n\\Omega_{L} = dq^{1} \\wedge dq^{2}\n$$\nThe space $J^{1}E$ is a $5$-dimensional manifold with local coordinates $(t, q^{1}, q^{2}, v^{1}, v^{2})$. The form $\\Omega_{L}$ only involves differentials of $q^{1}$ and $q^{2}$.\n\nTo find the kernel of $\\Omega_{L}$, we search for vector fields $V$ on $J^{1}E$ such that their interior product with $\\Omega_{L}$ is zero, i.e., $i_{V}\\Omega_{L} = 0$. Let $V$ be a general vector field:\n$$\nV = V_{t} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + V_{q^{1}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{1}} + V_{q^{2}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{2}} + V_{v^{1}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{1}} + V_{v^{2}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{2}}\n$$\nThe interior product is:\n$$\ni_{V}\\Omega_{L} = i_{V}(dq^{1} \\wedge dq^{2}) = (i_{V}dq^{1}) dq^{2} - (i_{V}dq^{2}) dq^{1}\n$$\nThe action of $i_{V}$ on a $1$-form is evaluation of the form on the vector field: $i_{V}dq^{A} = dq^{A}(V) = V_{q^{A}}$.\n$$\ni_{V}\\Omega_{L} = V_{q^{1}} \\, dq^{2} - V_{q^{2}} \\, dq^{1}\n$$\nFor this to be the zero $1$-form, the coefficients of the basis $1$-forms must be zero. Thus, we must have $V_{q^{1}} = 0$ and $V_{q^{2}} = 0$. The coefficients $V_{t}$, $V_{v^{1}}$, and $V_{v^{2}}$ can be arbitrary.\nTherefore, any vector field in the kernel of $\\Omega_{L}$ is a linear combination of the basis vectors $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{1}}$, and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{2}}$.\nThe kernel, $\\ker \\Omega_{L}$, is the distribution spanned by these three vector fields. The dimension of the kernel is the number of spanning vectors.\n$$\n\\dim(\\ker \\Omega_{L}) = 3\n$$\n\n### Task 2: Constraint Analysis on $T^{*}Q$\n\nWe perform the fiber derivative (Legendre transform) to define the canonical momenta $p_{A}$ and find the primary constraints. The configuration space is $Q \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, so the phase space is $T^{*}Q$ with coordinates $(q^{1}, q^{2}, p_{1}, p_{2})$.\n$$\np_{1} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v^{1}} = q^{2}\n$$\n$$\np_{2} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v^{2}} = 0\n$$\nThese equations define relationships among the phase space variables $(q^{A}, p_{A})$ that do not involve the velocities $v^{A}$. These are the primary constraints. We express them as functions that vanish on the constraint submanifold of $T^{*}Q$:\n$$\n\\phi_{1} := p_{1} - q^{2} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\phi_{2} := p_{2} = 0\n$$\nThere are two primary constraints. To classify them as first-class or second-class, we compute the matrix of their Poisson brackets, $C_{ij} = \\{\\phi_{i}, \\phi_{j}\\}$. The canonical Poisson brackets are $\\{q^{A}, p_{B}\\} = \\delta^{A}_{B}$, with all other fundamental brackets being zero.\n\nThe diagonal elements are zero:\n$$\n\\{\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{1}\\} = \\{p_{1} - q^{2}, p_{1} - q^{2}\\} = \\{p_{1},p_{1}\\} - \\{p_{1},q^{2}\\} - \\{q^{2},p_{1}\\} + \\{q^{2},q^{2}\\} = 0 - 0 - 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\{\\phi_{2}, \\phi_{2}\\} = \\{p_{2}, p_{2}\\} = 0\n$$\nThe off-diagonal element is:\n$$\n\\{\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{2}\\} = \\{p_{1} - q^{2}, p_{2}\\} = \\{p_{1}, p_{2}\\} - \\{q^{2}, p_{2}\\}\n$$\nUsing the fundamental brackets, $\\{p_{1}, p_{2}\\} = 0$ and $\\{q^{2}, p_{2}\\} = \\delta^{2}_{2} = 1$.\n$$\n\\{\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{2}\\} = 0 - 1 = -1\n$$\nBy the antisymmetry of the Poisson bracket, $\\{\\phi_{2}, \\phi_{1}\\} = -\\{\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{2}\\} = 1$. The Poisson bracket matrix is:\n$$\nC = \\begin{pmatrix} \\{\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{1}\\} & \\{\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{2}\\} \\\\ \\{\\phi_{2}, \\phi_{1}\\} & \\{\\phi_{2}, \\phi_{2}\\} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nA constraint is first-class if its Poisson bracket with all other constraints vanishes (on the constraint surface). The number of first-class constraints is the dimension of the null space of the matrix $C$. A linear combination $\\Psi = c^{1}\\phi_{1} + c^{2}\\phi_{2}$ is a first-class constraint if $\\{\\Psi, \\phi_{j}\\} = 0$ for $j=1,2$. This is equivalent to finding a vector $(c^{1}, c^{2})$ in the null space of $C$.\n$$\n\\det(C) = (0)(0) - (-1)(1) = 1\n$$\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the matrix $C$ is invertible. Its null space is trivial, containing only the zero vector. Therefore, there are no non-trivial linear combinations of $\\phi_{1}$ and $\\phi_{2}$ that form a first-class constraint. The number of first-class primary constraints is $0$.\n\nConstraints are second-class if their Poisson bracket matrix is non-degenerate. Since the matrix $C$ for the set of constraints $\\{\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{2}\\}$ is non-degenerate, both constraints are second-class. The number of second-class primary constraints is the rank of the matrix $C$, which is $2$.\n\nIn summary:\n- The dimension of $\\ker \\Omega_{L}$ is $3$.\n- The number of first-class primary constraints is $0$.\n- The number of second-class primary constraints is $2$.\n\nThe final answer is a row matrix of these three integers.",
