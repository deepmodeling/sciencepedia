            "problem": "Consider the space of smooth vector fields on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, denoted $\\mathfrak{X}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$, written in local coordinates as $u(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} u^{i}(x) \\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}$ and $v(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} v^{i}(x) \\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}$, where each $u^{i}$ and $v^{i}$ is a smooth scalar function. In the geometric mechanics description of ideal fluid motion, the Euler-Poincaré (EP) equations arise from reduction on the diffeomorphism group, and the algebraic structure enters through the Lie bracket of vector fields.

            "solution": "The problem is found to be valid as it is mathematically well-posed, self-contained, and scientifically grounded in the principles of differential geometry. It asks for the derivation of a standard result and the verification of fundamental properties from first principles.\n\nWe begin by deriving the coordinate expression for the Lie bracket $[u,v]$ of two smooth vector fields $u, v \\in \\mathfrak{X}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$. The vector fields are given in local coordinates by $u(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} u^{i}(x) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}$ and $v(x) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} v^{j}(x) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}}$. We use distinct indices $i$ and $j$ for the summations to avoid confusion. The Lie bracket is defined by its action as a commutator on an arbitrary smooth test function $f \\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$:\n$$\n[u,v](f) := u(v(f)) - v(u(f))\n$$\nFirst, we compute the action of $v$ on $f$:\n$$\nv(f) = \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{n} v^{j} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}} \\right) (f) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} v^{j} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{j}}\n$$\nThis result is a smooth scalar function. Now, we apply the vector field $u$ to this function:\n$$\nu(v(f)) = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} u^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}} \\right) \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{n} v^{j} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{j}} \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} u^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{n} v^{j} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{j}} \\right)\n$$\nApplying the product rule for differentiation with respect to $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}$ to the term inside the sum over $j$:\n$$\nu(v(f)) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} u^{i} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{\\partial v^{j}}{\\partial x^{i}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{j}} \\right) + v^{j} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x^{i} \\partial x^{j}} \\right) \\right]\n$$\nDistributing the sums, we obtain two terms:\n$$\nu(v(f)) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} u^{i} \\frac{\\partial v^{j}}{\\partial x^{i}} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{j}} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} u^{i} v^{j} \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x^{i} \\partial x^{j}}\n$$\nThe second term, $v(u(f))$, is obtained by symmetry, by interchanging the roles of $u$ and $v$ along with their corresponding indices $i$ and $j$:\n$$\nv(u(f)) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} v^{j} \\frac{\\partial u^{i}}{\\partial x^{j}} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}} + \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} v^{j} u^{i} \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x^{j} \\partial x^{i}}\n$$\nNow, we compute the commutator $[u,v](f) = u(v(f)) - v(u(f))$:\n$$\n[u,v](f) = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} u^{i} \\frac{\\partial v^{j}}{\\partial x^{i}} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{j}} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} u^{i} v^{j} \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x^{i} \\partial x^{j}} \\right) - \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} v^{j} \\frac{\\partial u^{i}}{\\partial x^{j}} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}} + \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} v^{j} u^{i} \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x^{j} \\partial x^{i}} \\right)\n$$\nLet's examine the terms involving second derivatives of $f$. Since $f$ is a smooth function ($C^{\\infty}$), its mixed partial derivatives are equal (Clairaut's theorem): $\\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x^{i} \\partial x^{j}} = \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x^{j} \\partial x^{i}}$. The coefficients $u^{i}v^{j}$ are also just functions, so the summation over $i$ and $j$ can be done in any order. Therefore, the second derivative terms cancel out:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} u^{i} v^{j} \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x^{i} \\partial x^{j}} - \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} v^{j} u^{i} \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x^{j} \\partial x^{i}} = \\sum_{i,j} u^{i} v^{j} \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x^{i} \\partial x^{j}} - \\sum_{i,j} u^{i} v^{j} \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x^{i} \\partial x^{j}} = 0\n$$\nWe are left with the first-order terms:\n$$\n[u,v](f) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} u^{i} \\frac{\\partial v^{j}}{\\partial x^{i}} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{j}} - \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} v^{j} \\frac{\\partial u^{i}}{\\partial x^{j}} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}\n$$\nTo identify the components of the vector field $[u,v]$, we must write this expression in the form $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} ([u,v])^{k} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{k}}$. We must make the index of the derivative of $f$ the same in both sums. In the second term, we relabel the summation indices by swapping $i$ and $j$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} v^{j} \\frac{\\partial u^{i}}{\\partial x^{j}} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} v^{i} \\frac{\\partial u^{j}}{\\partial x^{i}} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{j}}\n$$\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$\n[u,v](f) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} u^{i} \\frac{\\partial v^{j}}{\\partial x^{i}} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{j}} - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} v^{i} \\frac{\\partial u^{j}}{\\partial x^{i}} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{j}}\n$$\nWe can now factor out the common terms and change the order of summation:\n$$\n[u,v](f) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( u^{i} \\frac{\\partial v^{j}}{\\partial x^{i}} - v^{i} \\frac{\\partial u^{j}}{\\partial x^{i}} \\right) \\right) \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{j}}\n$$\nThe vector field $[u,v]$ is by definition the operator whose action on $f$ is given above. So, if we write $[u,v] = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} ([u,v])^{j} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}}$, we can identify its $j$-th component by comparing the expressions:\n$$\n([u,v])^{j} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( u^{i} \\frac{\\partial v^{j}}{\\partial x^{i}} - v^{i} \\frac{\\partial u^{j}}{\\partial x^{i}} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the explicit coordinate expression for the Lie bracket.\n\nNext, we verify the antisymmetry property, $[u,v] = -[v,u]$. From the fundamental definition:\n$$\n[u,v](f) = u(v(f)) - v(u(f)) = - (v(u(f)) - u(v(f))) = -[v,u](f)\n$$\nSince this holds for any smooth function $f \\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$, the vector fields themselves are equal: $[u,v] = -[v,u]$.\n\nFinally, we verify the Jacobi identity: $[u,[v,w]] + [v,[w,u]] + [w,[u,v]] = 0$. The problem asks for a derivation using the associativity of composition of linear differential operators. Let $L_{u}$ denote the linear differential operator corresponding to the vector field $u$, i.e., $L_{u}(f) = u(f)$. The definition of the Lie bracket can be written as the operator commutator:\n$$\n[u,v] = L_{u} L_{v} - L_{v} L_{u}\n$$\nwhere composition of operators means successive application, e.g., $(L_{u}L_{v})(f) = L_{u}(L_{v}(f)) = u(v(f))$. The Jacobi identity for vector fields is equivalent to the Jacobi identity for their corresponding operators. We need to show:\n$$\n[L_{u}, [L_{v}, L_{w}]] + [L_{v}, [L_{w}, L_{u}]] + [L_{w}, [L_{u}, L_{v}]] = 0\n$$\nWe expand each term using the commutator definition. For the first term:\n$$\n[L_{u}, [L_{v}, L_{w}]] = [L_{u}, (L_{v}L_{w} - L_{w}L_{v})] = L_{u}(L_{v}L_{w} - L_{w}L_{v}) - (L_{v}L_{w} - L_{w}L_{v})L_{u}\n$$\nUsing the distributive property of operator composition, we get:\n$$\n[L_{u}, [L_{v}, L_{w}]] = L_{u}L_{v}L_{w} - L_{u}L_{w}L_{v} - L_{v}L_{w}L_{u} + L_{w}L_{v}L_{u}\n$$\nThe other two terms are found by cyclic permutation of $u, v, w$:\n$$\n[L_{v}, [L_{w}, L_{u}]] = L_{v}L_{w}L_{u} - L_{v}L_{u}L_{w} - L_{w}L_{u}L_{v} + L_{u}L_{w}L_{v}\n$$\n$$\n[L_{w}, [L_{u}, L_{v}]] = L_{w}L_{u}L_{v} - L_{w}L_{v}L_{u} - L_{u}L_{v}L_{w} + L_{v}L_{u}L_{w}\n$$\nNow we sum these three expressions. The key property is that composition of these linear operators is associative, e.g., $(L_u L_v)L_w = L_u(L_v L_w)$.\nSumming the terms:\n\\begin{align*}\n& (L_{u}L_{v}L_{w} - L_{u}L_{w}L_{v} - L_{v}L_{w}L_{u} + L_{w}L_{v}L_{u}) \\\\\n+ & (L_{v}L_{w}L_{u} - L_{v}L_{u}L_{w} - L_{w}L_{u}L_{v} + L_{u}L_{w}L_{v}) \\\\\n+ & (L_{w}L_{u}L_{v} - L_{w}L_{v}L_{u} - L_{u}L_{v}L_{w} + L_{v}L_{u}L_{w}) \\\\\n= & \\ (L_{u}L_{v}L_{w} - L_{u}L_{v}L_{w}) + (-L_{u}L_{w}L_{v} + L_{u}L_{w}L_{v}) + (-L_{v}L_{w}L_{u} + L_{v}L_{w}L_{u}) \\\\\n& + (L_{w}L_{v}L_{u} - L_{w}L_{v}L_{u}) + (-L_{v}L_{u}L_{w} + L_{v}L_{u}L_{w}) + (-L_{w}L_{u}L_{v} + L_{w}L_{u}L_{v}) \\\\\n= & \\ 0\n\\end{align*}\nAll terms cancel in pairs. This proves that the sum of the operators is the zero operator. Since this holds for the operators, it holds for the vector fields themselves. The Jacobi identity is satisfied. This completes the required verifications.\n\nThe problem requests the $i$-th component of $[u,v]$ as the final answer. Relabeling the index $j$ to $i$ and the summation index $i$ to $j$ in our derived formula gives the desired expression.",

            "solution": "This problem is addressed in three parts: first, the derivation of a general vector field decomposition; second, the application of this decomposition to the Euler equations for an ideal fluid; and third, the explicit solution for the pressure field for a given velocity.\n\nThe manifold is the flat two-dimensional torus $\\mathbb{T}^{2} = (\\mathbb{R}/2\\pi\\mathbb{Z})^{2}$, with coordinates $(x_1, x_2)$, equipped with the standard Euclidean metric $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$. The associated area element is $dA = dx_1 dx_2$. The fundamental operators are the gradient $\\nabla$, the divergence $\\operatorname{div}$, and the Laplacian $\\Delta$. For a scalar function $\\phi$, the gradient is $\\nabla \\phi = (\\partial_1 \\phi, \\partial_2 \\phi)$. For a vector field $w=(w_1, w_2)$, the divergence is $\\operatorname{div}(w) = \\partial_1 w_1 + \\partial_2 w_2$. The Laplacian on a scalar is $\\Delta \\phi = \\operatorname{div}(\\nabla \\phi) = \\partial_1^2 \\phi + \\partial_2^2 \\phi$. The $L^2$ inner product of two vector fields $v$ and $w$ is given by $\\langle v, w \\rangle_{L^2} = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^2} v \\cdot w \\, dA$.\n\n**Part 1: Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition on $\\mathbb{T}^2$**\n\nThe Hodge decomposition theorem, when applied to vector fields (viewed as $1$-forms) on a compact, orientable Riemannian manifold without boundary like $\\mathbb{T}^2$, states that any sufficiently smooth vector field $w$ can be uniquely decomposed into three mutually $L^2$-orthogonal components: a gradient (exact) component, a divergence-free (co-exact) component with zero mean, and a harmonic component. On the flat torus $\\mathbb{T}^2$, the harmonic vector fields are the constant vector fields. The problem statement implies a decomposition into only the first two types, which is standard in fluid dynamics and is known as the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition.\n\nLet $w$ be a smooth vector field on $\\mathbb{T}^2$. We seek a decomposition of the form:\n$$\nw = v + \\nabla \\phi\n$$\nwhere $v$ is a divergence-free vector field, $\\operatorname{div}(v)=0$, and $\\phi$ is a scalar potential. To ensure the uniqueness of this decomposition, we require that the potential $\\phi$ has zero mean over the torus:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{T}^2} \\phi \\, dA = 0\n$$\nThis condition fixes the potential up to an additive constant, which is then set to zero. The uniqueness of the decomposition also relies on the $L^2$-orthogonality of the space of divergence-free vector fields and the space of gradient fields of zero-mean potentials. Let $v$ be a divergence-free field and $\\nabla\\phi$ be a gradient field. Their $L^2$ inner product is:\n$$\n\\langle v, \\nabla \\phi \\rangle = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^2} v \\cdot \\nabla \\phi \\, dA\n$$\nUsing integration by parts (which is an application of Green's first identity or the divergence theorem), and noting that $\\operatorname{div}(\\phi v) = (\\nabla \\phi) \\cdot v + \\phi(\\operatorname{div} v)$, we have:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{T}^2} v \\cdot \\nabla \\phi \\, dA = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^2} \\operatorname{div}(\\phi v) \\, dA - \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^2} \\phi(\\operatorname{div} v) \\, dA\n$$\nThe first term on the right vanishes by the divergence theorem applied to the manifold $\\mathbb{T}^2$, which has no boundary. The second term vanishes because $v$ is divergence-free, i.e., $\\operatorname{div}(v)=0$. Thus, $\\langle v, \\nabla \\phi \\rangle = 0$.\n\nTo find the equation satisfied by the potential $\\phi$, we take the divergence of the decomposition $w = v + \\nabla \\phi$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{div}(w) = \\operatorname{div}(v) + \\operatorname{div}(\\nabla \\phi)\n$$\nBy definition, $\\operatorname{div}(v)=0$ and $\\operatorname{div}(\\nabla \\phi) = \\Delta \\phi$. This leads to the following elliptic partial differential equation for the potential $\\phi$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\phi = \\operatorname{div}(w)\n$$\nThis is a Poisson equation for $\\phi$. Given the source term $\\operatorname{div}(w)$, this equation, together with the condition of zero mean $\\int_{\\mathbb{T}^2} \\phi \\, dA = 0$, has a unique solution for $\\phi$ on the torus $\\mathbb{T}^2$.\n\n**Part 2: The Role of Pressure in the Euler Equations**\n\nThe Euler equations for an ideal, incompressible fluid with velocity $u$ and pressure $p$ are:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} u + u \\cdot \\nabla u + \\nabla p = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\operatorname{div} u = 0\n$$\nSince the velocity field $u$ is divergence-free for all time $t$, its time derivative $\\partial_t u$ must also be divergence-free, assuming sufficient smoothness to interchange time and space derivatives: $\\operatorname{div}(\\partial_t u) = \\partial_t(\\operatorname{div} u) = \\partial_t(0) = 0$.\n\nLet us rearrange the Euler equation as:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} u + \\nabla p = - (u \\cdot \\nabla u)\n$$\nThe term $u \\cdot \\nabla u$ is a general vector field. We can apply the decomposition derived in Part 1 to the vector field $w = u \\cdot \\nabla u$. Let $w = v + \\nabla \\phi$, where $\\operatorname{div}(v)=0$ and $\\phi$ is a zero-mean potential. The Euler equation can be written as:\n$$\n\\partial_t u + \\nabla p = -v - \\nabla \\phi\n$$\nThis equation represents a decomposition of the vector field $-(u \\cdot \\nabla u)$ into different components. More precisely, let us define the Leray projector, $P$, as the orthogonal projection onto the space of divergence-free vector fields. Because the spaces of divergence-free fields and gradient fields are orthogonal, we have $P(\\nabla f) = 0$ for any scalar function $f$. Also, if a field $q$ is divergence-free, then $P(q)=q$.\n\nApplying the Leray projector $P$ to the Euler equation:\n$$\nP(\\partial_t u) + P(u \\cdot \\nabla u) + P(\\nabla p) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\partial_t u$ is divergence-free, $P(\\partial_t u) = \\partial_t u$. Since $\\nabla p$ is a gradient field, $P(\\nabla p) = 0$. The equation reduces to the \"projected\" Euler equation:\n$$\n\\partial_t u + P(u \\cdot \\nabla u) = 0\n$$\nThis shows that the dynamics of the incompressible fluid evolve entirely within the subspace of divergence-free vector fields. The term $P(u \\cdot \\nabla u)$ is the divergence-free part of the nonlinear advection term $u \\cdot \\nabla u$.\n\nComparing the original Euler equation, $\\partial_{t} u = - (u \\cdot \\nabla u) - \\nabla p$, with the projected equation, $\\partial_t u = - P(u \\cdot \\nabla u)$, we identify the role of the pressure gradient. The term $-\\nabla p$ is precisely the component of $-(u \\cdot \\nabla u)$ that is removed by the projection. In other words, $\\nabla p$ is the gradient part of the vector field $u \\cdot \\nabla u$.\nSo, let $w = u \\cdot \\nabla u$. Its gradient part is $\\nabla p$. Following the procedure from Part 1, the pressure $p$ must be the scalar potential whose gradient is the gradient part of $u \\cdot \\nabla u$. Taking the divergence of the Euler equation gives:\n$$\n\\operatorname{div}(\\partial_t u) + \\operatorname{div}(u \\cdot \\nabla u) + \\operatorname{div}(\\nabla p) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\operatorname{div}(\\partial_t u) = 0$, this simplifies to $\\operatorname{div}(u \\cdot \\nabla u) + \\Delta p = 0$. Thus, the elliptic equation for the pressure is:\n$$\n\\Delta p = - \\operatorname{div}(u \\cdot \\nabla u)\n$$\nTo ensure a unique solution for $p$, the standard normalization in this context is to require $p$ to have zero mean: $\\int_{\\mathbb{T}^2} p \\, dA = 0$.\n\n**Part 3: Solution for the Pressure Field**\n\nWe are given the velocity field $u(x_1, x_2) = (\\sin x_1 \\cos x_2, -\\cos x_1 \\sin x_2)$.\nFirst, we compute the nonlinear term $u \\cdot \\nabla u$.

This practice guides you in deriving the Lie-Poisson bracket on the dual of the Lie algebra, where vorticity lives.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is a well-posed question in the established field of geometric mechanics and fluid dynamics, with all necessary information provided and no scientific or logical contradictions.\n\nThe motion of an ideal incompressible fluid on the two-torus $\\mathbb{T}^2$ can be described as a geodesic flow on the infinite-dimensional Lie group $G = \\text{Diff}_{\\text{vol}}(\\mathbb{T}^2)$ of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms. The Lagrangian is the kinetic energy of the fluid, $L(u) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^2} |u|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}A$, where $u$ is the Eulerian velocity field and $\\mathrm{d}A = \\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y$. The dynamics is governed by the Euler-Poincaré equations on the Lie algebra of $G$ or its dual.\n\nThe Lie algebra of $G$, denoted $\\mathfrak{g}$, is the space of divergence-free vector fields on $\\mathbb{T}^2$, i.e., $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{X}_{\\text{div}}(\\mathbb{T}^2)$. For a two-dimensional incompressible fluid, any velocity field $u \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ can be derived from a stream function $\\psi$ via $u = \\nabla^{\\perp}\\psi = (\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial y}, -\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial x})$. The stream function is defined up to an additive constant. Thus, the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ can be identified with the space of smooth functions on $\\mathbb{T}^2$ modulo constants, $C^\\infty(\\mathbb{T}^2)/\\mathbb{R}$. The Lie bracket on $\\mathfrak{g}$ for two vector fields $u_1 = \\nabla^{\\perp}\\psi_1$ and $u_2 = \\nabla^{\\perp}\\psi_2$ corresponds to the standard Poisson bracket of their stream functions: $[u_1, u_2]_{\\text{vect}} = \\nabla^{\\perp}\\{\\psi_1, \\psi_2\\}$, where $\\{\\psi_1, \\psi_2\\} = \\frac{\\partial\\psi_1}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial\\psi_2}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial\\psi_1}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial\\psi_2}{\\partial x}$. The Lie bracket on the space of stream functions is therefore $[\\psi_1, \\psi_2]_{\\mathfrak{g}} = \\{\\psi_1, \\psi_2\\}$.\n\nThe dual of the Lie algebra, $\\mathfrak{g}^*$, can be identified with the space of scalar vorticities. The vorticity is defined as $\\omega = \\text{curl}(u) = \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y}$. In terms of the stream function, $\\omega = -\\Delta\\psi$. The natural pairing between an element $\\omega \\in \\mathfrak{g}^*$ and an element $\\psi \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ is given by the $L^2$-pairing:\n$$ \\langle\\langle \\omega, \\psi \\rangle\\rangle = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^2} \\omega(x,y)\\psi(x,y) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y $$\n\nThe Lie-Poisson bracket for two functionals $F(\\omega)$ and $G(\\omega)$ on the dual space $\\mathfrak{g}^*$ is defined by the Lie algebra structure as:\n$$ \\{F, G\\}(\\omega) = \\left\\langle\\left\\langle \\omega, \\left[ \\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta \\omega}, \\frac{\\delta G}{\\delta \\omega} \\right]_{\\mathfrak{g}} \\right\\rangle\\right\\rangle $$\nHere, the functional derivatives $\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta \\omega}$ and $\\frac{\\delta G}{\\delta \\omega}$ are elements of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, i.e., they are interpreted as stream functions. They are defined via the variation $\\delta F = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^2} \\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta \\omega} \\delta\\omega \\, \\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y$.\n\nSubstituting the Lie bracket for stream functions, $[\\psi_1, \\psi_2]_{\\mathfrak{g}} = \\{\\psi_1, \\psi_2\\}$, and the pairing into the general formula, we obtain the Lie-Poisson bracket for 2D ideal fluids in the vorticity representation:\n$$ \\{F, G\\}(\\omega) = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^2} \\omega(x,y) \\left\\{ \\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta \\omega}, \\frac{\\delta G}{\\delta \\omega} \\right\\} \\, \\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y $$\nThe bilinear operator appearing in this bracket is the standard Poisson bracket $\\{ \\cdot , \\cdot \\}$ for functions on $\\mathbb{T}^2$.\n\nThis structure is underpinned by the coadjoint action of the Lie group on the dual of its Lie algebra. The equation of motion for vorticity, $\\frac{\\partial\\omega}{\\partial t} + u \\cdot \\nabla \\omega = 0$, can be written as $\\frac{\\partial\\omega}{\\partial t} + \\{\\psi, \\omega\\} = 0$. This is a Hamiltonian equation $\\frac{d\\omega}{dt} = \\{\\omega, H\\}$ with respect to the Lie-Poisson bracket, where the Hamiltonian is the kinetic energy expressed in terms of vorticity. The evolution corresponds to the coadjoint action: $\\frac{d\\omega}{dt} = -\\text{ad}_{\\delta H/\\delta \\omega}^* \\omega$. The coadjoint action of an element $\\psi \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ on an element $\\omega \\in \\mathfrak{g}^*$ is found from the pairing:\n$$ \\langle\\langle \\text{ad}_{\\psi}^*\\omega, \\phi \\rangle\\rangle = \\langle\\langle \\omega, [\\psi, \\phi]_{\\mathfrak{g}} \\rangle\\rangle = \\int \\omega \\{\\psi, \\phi\\} \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\int (-\\{\\psi, \\omega\\}) \\phi \\, \\mathrm{d}A $$\nwhere integration by parts was used. Thus, the coadjoint action is given by $\\text{ad}_{\\psi}^* \\omega = -\\{\\psi, \\omega\\}$.\n\nNow we evaluate the bracket for the given functionals and vorticity field. The functionals are:\n$$ F(\\omega) = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^{2}} \\cos(x)\\,\\omega(x,y)\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y $$\n$$ G(\\omega) = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^{2}} \\sin(y)\\,\\omega(x,y)\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y $$\nTo find the functional derivatives, we take the variations:\n$$ \\delta F = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^{2}} \\cos(x)\\,\\delta\\omega\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y \\implies \\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta \\omega} = \\cos(x) $$\n$$ \\delta G = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^{2}} \\sin(y)\\,\\delta\\omega\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y \\implies \\frac{\\delta G}{\\delta \\omega} = \\sin(y) $$\nNext, we compute the Poisson bracket of the functional derivatives:\n$$ \\left\\{ \\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta \\omega}, \\frac{\\delta G}{\\delta \\omega} \\right\\} = \\{\\cos(x), \\sin(y)\\} = \\frac{\\partial(\\cos x)}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial(\\sin y)}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial(\\cos x)}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial(\\sin y)}{\\partial x} $$\n$$ = (-\\sin x)(\\cos y) - (0)(0) = -\\sin(x)\\cos(y) $$\nNow, we substitute these results into the Lie-Poisson bracket formula and evaluate it at the given vorticity field $\\omega(x,y) = -\\sin(x)\\cos(y)$:\n$$ \\{F, G\\}(\\omega) = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^{2}} \\omega(x,y) \\left\\{ \\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta \\omega}, \\frac{\\delta G}{\\delta \\omega} \\right\\} \\, \\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y $$\n$$ \\{F, G\\}(\\omega) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} (-\\sin(x)\\cos(y))(-\\sin(x)\\cos(y)) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y $$\n$$ = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\sin^2(x)\\cos^2(y) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y $$\nThe integral is separable:\n$$ = \\left( \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\sin^2(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x \\right) \\left( \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\cos^2(y) \\, \\mathrm{d}y \\right) $$\nWe use the standard definite integrals over a full period: $\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sin^2(\\theta)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta = \\pi$ and $\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\cos^2(\\theta)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta = \\pi$.\nTo confirm, we use the identity $\\sin^2(x) = \\frac{1 - \\cos(2x)}{2}$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{1 - \\cos(2x)}{2} \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[x - \\frac{\\sin(2x)}{2}\\right]_{0}^{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2}(2\\pi - 0) = \\pi $$\nAnd similarly for $\\cos^2(y) = \\frac{1 + \\cos(2y)}{2}$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{1 + \\cos(2y)}{2} \\, \\mathrm{d}y = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[y + \\frac{\\sin(2y)}{2}\\right]_{0}^{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2}(2\\pi - 0) = \\pi $$\nTherefore, the value of the Lie-Poisson bracket is:\n$$ \\{F, G\\}(\\omega) = (\\pi)(\\pi) = \\pi^2 $$",
