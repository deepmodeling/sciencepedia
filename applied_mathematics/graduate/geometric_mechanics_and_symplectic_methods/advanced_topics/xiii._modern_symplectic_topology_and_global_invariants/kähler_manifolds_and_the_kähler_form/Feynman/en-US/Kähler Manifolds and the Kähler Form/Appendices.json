This exercise guides you through the process of complexifying the tangent bundle to see how it naturally splits into two subbundles, $T^{1,0}M$ and $T^{0,1}M$. Mastering this decomposition is essential, as it forms the basis for defining holomorphic vectors, differential forms of type $(p,q)$, and the Dolbeault operators $\\partial$ and $\\bar{\\partial}$.",

Express your final answer as a single symbolic expression in terms of $n$.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the construction of the complex distribution $T^{1,0}M$ and the computation of its complex rank. The starting point is a smooth manifold $M$ of real dimension $2n$, equipped with an almost complex structure $J$, which is a $(1,1)$-tensor satisfying $J^2 = -\\mathrm{id}$.\n\nLet us consider the tangent space $T_p M$ at an arbitrary point $p \\in M$. This is a real vector space of dimension $2n$. The almost complex structure $J$ acts as a real linear map on each tangent space, $J_p: T_p M \\to T_p M$, such that $J_p^2 = -\\mathrm{id}_{T_p M}$.\n\nWe then consider the complexification of the tangent bundle, $TM \\otimes \\mathbb{C}$. At each point $p \\in M$, the fiber is the complexified tangent space $T_p M \\otimes \\mathbb{C}$. As a complex vector space, its dimension is equal to the real dimension of $T_p M$. Thus, $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(T_p M \\otimes \\mathbb{C}) = 2n$. Any vector $V \\in T_p M \\otimes \\mathbb{C}$ can be uniquely expressed as $V = X + iY$, where $X, Y \\in T_p M$.\n\nThe problem specifies that $J_{\\mathbb{C}}$ is the complex-linear extension of $J$ to $TM \\otimes \\mathbb{C}$. The action of its fiber map, $J_{\\mathbb{C}, p}: T_p M \\otimes \\mathbb{C} \\to T_p M \\otimes \\mathbb{C}$, on a vector $V = X + iY$ is given by:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathbb{C}}(V) = J_{\\mathbb{C}}(X+iY) = J(X) + iJ(Y)\n$$\nWe are asked to construct $T^{1,0}M$ as the $+i$-eigensubbundle of $J_{\\mathbb{C}}$. This means that for each point $p \\in M$, the fiber $T_p^{1,0}M$ is the eigenspace of $J_{\\mathbb{C}, p}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $+i$.\n\nTo find the rank of this subbundle, we must first determine the eigenvalues of the operator $J_{\\mathbb{C}, p}$. Let $V \\in T_p M \\otimes \\mathbb{C}$ be a non-zero eigenvector of $J_{\\mathbb{C}, p}$ with a corresponding eigenvalue $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathbb{C}}(V) = \\lambda V\n$$\nApplying the operator $J_{\\mathbb{C}}$ a second time yields:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathbb{C}}^2(V) = J_{\\mathbb{C}}(\\lambda V) = \\lambda J_{\\mathbb{C}}(V) = \\lambda (\\lambda V) = \\lambda^2 V\n$$\nThe property $J^2 = -\\mathrm{id}$ for the real operator $J$ implies that its complex-linear extension $J_{\\mathbb{C}}$ also satisfies $J_{\\mathbb{C}}^2 = -\\mathrm{id}_{\\mathbb{C}}$. We verify this by acting on an arbitrary vector $V = X + iY$:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathbb{C}}^2(X+iY) = J_{\\mathbb{C}}(J(X)+iJ(Y)) = J(J(X)) + iJ(J(Y)) = J^2(X) + iJ^2(Y) = -X - iY = -(X+iY) = -V\n$$\nThis confirms that $J_{\\mathbb{C}}^2 = -\\mathrm{id}_{\\mathbb{C}}$. By equating the two derived expressions for $J_{\\mathbb{C}}^2(V)$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\lambda^2 V = -V\n$$\nSince $V$ is a non-zero eigenvector, we can divide by $V$ to find the equation for the eigenvalues:\n$$\n\\lambda^2 = -1\n$$\nThe solutions for $\\lambda$ in the field of complex numbers are $\\lambda = +i$ and $\\lambda = -i$. This shows that $J_{\\mathbb{C},p}$ has exactly two distinct eigenvalues.\n\nConsequently, the complexified tangent space $T_p M \\otimes \\mathbb{C}$ decomposes into a direct sum of the eigenspaces corresponding to these eigenvalues. We denote these eigenspaces as $T_p^{1,0}M$ for the eigenvalue $+i$ and $T_p^{0,1}M$ for the eigenvalue $-i$:\n$$\nT_p^{1,0}M = \\{ V \\in T_p M \\otimes \\mathbb{C} \\mid J_{\\mathbb{C}}(V) = iV \\}\n$$\n$$\nT_p^{0,1}M = \\{ V \\in T_p M \\otimes \\mathbb{C} \\mid J_{\\mathbb{C}}(V) = -iV \\}\n$$\nThe direct sum decomposition is $T_p M \\otimes \\mathbb{C} = T_p^{1,0}M \\oplus T_p^{0,1}M$.\n\nThe complex rank of the subbundle $T^{1,0}M$ is the complex dimension of its fiber $T_p^{1,0}M$. Let us denote the complex dimensions as $d_{1,0} = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(T_p^{1,0}M)$ and $d_{0,1} = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(T_p^{0,1}M)$. From the direct sum decomposition, the sum of these dimensions must equal the total dimension of the space:\n$$\n\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(T_p M \\otimes \\mathbb{C}) = d_{1,0} + d_{0,1}\n$$\nAs established earlier, $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(T_p M \\otimes \\mathbb{C}) = 2n$, so we have:\n$$\n2n = d_{1,0} + d_{0,1}\n$$\nTo find the individual dimensions, we establish a relationship between the two eigenspaces. Consider the map of complex conjugation on $T_p M \\otimes \\mathbb{C}$, denoted by $c$. For a vector $V = X+iY$ with $X,Y \\in T_p M$, this map is defined as $c(V) = X-iY$. The map $c$ is complex anti-linear.\n\nLet $V$ be an arbitrary vector in $T_p^{1,0}M$. By definition, $J_{\\mathbb{C}}(V) = iV$. Applying the conjugation map $c$ to both sides of this equation gives:\n$$\nc(J_{\\mathbb{C}}(V)) = c(iV)\n$$\nSince $J$ is a real operator ($J(T_p M) \\subseteq T_p M$), its extension $J_{\\mathbb{C}}$ commutes with conjugation. That is, $c(J_{\\mathbb{C}}(V)) = J_{\\mathbb{C}}(c(V))$. The right side, due to the anti-linearity of $c$, becomes $c(iV) = -i c(V)$. Equating the results, we find that for any $V \\in T_p^{1,0}M$:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathbb{C}}(c(V)) = -i c(V)\n$$\nThis equation shows that if $V \\in T_p^{1,0}M$, then its conjugate $c(V)$ is an element of the other eigenspace, $T_p^{0,1}M$. The conjugation map $c$ establishes a bijection between $T_p^{1,0}M$ and $T_p^{0,1}M$. Since $c$ is an isomorphism of the underlying real vector spaces, the two complex vector spaces must have the same dimension:\n$$\nd_{1,0} = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(T_p^{1,0}M) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(T_p^{0,1}M) = d_{0,1}\n$$\nSubstituting this equality into the dimension sum equation, we get:\n$$\n2n = d_{1,0} + d_{1,0} = 2 d_{1,0}\n$$\nSolving for $d_{1,0}$ gives:\n$$\nd_{1,0} = n\n$$\nThis result is independent of the point $p \\in M$. Thus, the dimension of each fiber $T_p^{1,0}M$ of the vector bundle $T^{1,0}M$ is $n$. The complex rank of the complex vector bundle $T^{1,0}M$ is therefore $n$. The other data provided, namely the Riemannian metric $g$ and the symplectic form $\\omega$, are part of the full Kähler structure but are not necessary for this particular calculation, which relies solely on the property $J^2 = -\\mathrm{id}$ and the dimension of the manifold.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for a three-part derivation and computation concerning the standard Kähler structure on the complex Euclidean space $\\mathbb{C}^n$. We will address each part in sequence, starting from the given definitions.\n\nThe complex coordinates on $\\mathbb{C}^n$ are $z^j = x^j + i y^j$ for $j=1, \\dots, n$. The corresponding real coordinates are $x^j, y^j$. The complex differential forms $dz^j$ and $d\\bar{z}^j$ are related to the real differential forms $dx^j$ and $dy^j$ by:\n$$dz^j = d(x^j + i y^j) = dx^j + i dy^j$$\n$$d\\bar{z}^j = d(x^j - i y^j) = dx^j - i dy^j$$\nThe problem statement provides a bilinear form on the complexified tangent bundle $T\\mathbb{C}^n \\otimes \\mathbb{C}$, denoted $g = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} dz^{j}\\otimes d\\bar{z}^{j}$. In the context of Kähler geometry, this expression defines a Hermitian metric. To avoid confusion with the associated Riemannian metric, we will temporarily denote this Hermitian metric as $h$. The Riemannian metric, which the problem also calls $g$ in the relation $\\omega(X,Y)=g(JX,Y)$, is given by the real part of $h$.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the Riemannian metric in the real coframe $\\{dx^j, dy^j\\}_{j=1}^n$. Let's call this metric $g_{\\mathbb{R}}$.\n$$\nh = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} dz^{j}\\otimes d\\bar{z}^{j} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (dx^j + i dy^j) \\otimes (dx^j - i dy^j)\n$$\nExpanding the tensor product, we obtain:\n$$\nh = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left( dx^j \\otimes dx^j - i dx^j \\otimes dy^j + i dy^j \\otimes dx^j + dy^j \\otimes dy^j \\right)\n$$\n$$\nh = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left( dx^j \\otimes dx^j + dy^j \\otimes dy^j \\right) + i \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left( dy^j \\otimes dx^j - dx^j \\otimes dy^j \\right)\n$$\nThe Riemannian metric $g_{\\mathbb{R}}$ is the real part of the Hermitian metric $h$:\n$$\ng_{\\mathbb{R}} = \\operatorname{Re}(h) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left( dx^j \\otimes dx^j + dy^j \\otimes dy^j \\right)\n$$\nThis is the expression for the metric in the real coframe. This is the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n} \\cong \\mathbb{C}^n$.\n\nNext, we argue that $g_{\\mathbb{R}}$ is positive-definite. Let $V$ be a tangent vector field, which can be expressed in the real basis as $V = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\left( a_k \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k} + b_k \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k} \\right)$ for some real functions $a_k, b_k$. The action of the coframe vectors on $V$ gives $dx^j(V) = a_j$ and $dy^j(V) = b_j$. Applying the metric to $V$:\n$$\ng_{\\mathbb{R}}(V, V) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left( (dx^j(V))^2 + (dy^j(V))^2 \\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left( a_j^2 + b_j^2 \\right)\n$$\nSince $a_j$ and $b_j$ are real, $a_j^2 \\ge 0$ and $b_j^2 \\ge 0$. Thus, $g_{\\mathbb{R}}(V, V) \\ge 0$. Furthermore, $g_{\\mathbb{R}}(V, V) = 0$ if and only if $a_j = 0$ and $b_j = 0$ for all $j$, which implies $V=0$. Therefore, the metric $g_{\\mathbb{R}}$ is positive-definite.\n\nFinally, for the first part, we show that $g_{\\mathbb{R}}$ is compatible with the complex structure $J$, i.e., $g_{\\mathbb{R}}(JX, JY) = g_{\\mathbb{R}}(X, Y)$ for any vectors $X, Y$. We check this on the basis vectors $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}\\}$.\n- $g_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left(J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right) = g_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = \\delta_{kl}$. This equals $g_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right) = \\delta_{kl}$.\n- $g_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left(J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = g_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left(-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right) = g_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right) = \\delta_{kl}$. This equals $g_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = \\delta_{kl}$.\n- $g_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left(J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = g_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right) = 0$. This equals $g_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = 0$.\nBy linearity, compatibility holds for all vectors. Adopting the problem's notation, we will henceforth denote $g_{\\mathbb{R}}$ as $g$.\n\nSecond, we derive the expression for the Kähler form $\\omega$ using the defining relation $\\omega(X,Y) = g(JX,Y)$. We compute the action of $\\omega$ on pairs of basis vectors:\n- $\\omega\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right) = g\\left(J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right) = g\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l}\\right) = 0$.\n- $\\omega\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = g\\left(J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = g\\left(-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = 0$.\n- $\\omega\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = g\\left(J\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = g\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}\\right) = \\delta_{kl}$.\nFrom these components, we construct the $2$-form $\\omega$. The only non-zero components are for pairs of the form $(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k})$. The $2$-form $\\sum_{j=1}^n dx^j \\wedge dy^j$ has these exact components, since $(dx^j \\wedge dy^j)(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l}) = \\delta^j_k \\delta^j_l = \\delta_{kl}$. Thus, the expression for $\\omega$ in the real coframe is:\n$$\n\\omega = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} dx^j \\wedge dy^j\n$$\nNow we relate this to the given expression in complex coordinates, $\\omega_{given} = \\frac{i}{2}\\sum_{j=1}^{n} dz^{j}\\wedge d\\bar{z}^{j}$. We expand the wedge product:\n$$\ndz^j \\wedge d\\bar{z}^j = (dx^j + i dy^j) \\wedge (dx^j - i dy^j) = dx^j \\wedge dx^j - i dx^j \\wedge dy^j + i dy^j \\wedge dx^j - i^2 dy^j \\wedge dy^j\n$$\nUsing $dx^j \\wedge dx^j = 0$, $dy^j \\wedge dx^j = -dx^j \\wedge dy^j$, and $i^2 = -1$:\n$$\ndz^j \\wedge d\\bar{z}^j = 0 - i dx^j \\wedge dy^j - i dx^j \\wedge dy^j - (-1)(0) = -2i dx^j \\wedge dy^j\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\omega_{given}$:\n$$\n\\omega_{given} = \\frac{i}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (-2i dx^j \\wedge dy^j) = \\frac{-2i^2}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} dx^j \\wedge dy^j = \\frac{-2(-1)}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} dx^j \\wedge dy^j = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} dx^j \\wedge dy^j\n$$\nThis confirms that the expression given in complex coordinates is consistent with the one derived from the fundamental definition $\\omega(X,Y) = g(JX,Y)$.\n\nThird, we compute the exterior derivative $d\\omega$. By definition, a Kähler form is a closed $2$-form, so we expect $d\\omega = 0$. We verify this explicitly. Using the real coordinate expression for $\\omega$:\n$$\nd\\omega = d\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} dx^j \\wedge dy^j\\right)\n$$\nBy linearity of the exterior derivative:\n$$\nd\\omega = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} d(dx^j \\wedge dy^j)\n$$\nUsing the graded Leibniz rule $d(\\alpha \\wedge \\beta) = d\\alpha \\wedge \\beta + (-1)^{\\deg\\alpha} \\alpha \\wedge d\\beta$, where $\\deg(dx^j)=1$:\n$$\nd(dx^j \\wedge dy^j) = d(dx^j) \\wedge dy^j - dx^j \\wedge d(dy^j)\n$$\nThe forms $dx^j$ and $dy^j$ are the exterior derivatives of the coordinate functions $x^j$ and $y^j$, respectively. A fundamental property of the exterior derivative is that it is nilpotent, i.e., $d^2 = 0$. Applied to the $0$-forms (functions) $x^j$ and $y^j$, this gives:\n$$\nd(dx^j) = d(d(x^j)) = 0\n$$\n$$\nd(dy^j) = d(d(y^j)) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting these back, we get:\n$$\nd(dx^j \\wedge dy^j) = 0 \\wedge dy^j - dx^j \\wedge 0 = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the exterior derivative of the Kähler form is:\n$$\nd\\omega = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} 0 = 0\n$$\nThe expression is fully simplified.",

We compute $\\partial\\bar{\\partial}\\phi$ as a $(1,1)$-form:\n$$\n\\partial\\bar{\\partial}\\phi = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial z \\partial \\bar{z}} dz \\wedge d\\bar{z}\n$$\nFirst, we find the partial derivative of $\\phi$ with respect to $\\bar{z}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial \\bar{z}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}} \\ln(1+z\\bar{z}) = \\frac{z}{1+z\\bar{z}}\n$$\nNext, we differentiate this result with respect to $z$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial z \\partial \\bar{z}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left(\\frac{z}{1+z\\bar{z}}\\right) = \\frac{(1)(1+z\\bar{z}) - z(\\bar{z})}{(1+z\\bar{z})^2} = \\frac{1+z\\bar{z}-z\\bar{z}}{(1+z\\bar{z})^2} = \\frac{1}{(1+|z|^2)^2}\n$$\nThus, the $(1,1)$-form $\\partial\\bar{\\partial}\\phi$ is:\n$$\n\\partial\\bar{\\partial}\\phi = \\frac{1}{(1+|z|^2)^2} dz \\wedge d\\bar{z}\n$$\nThe Kähler form $\\omega$ is then:\n$$\n\\omega = i\\partial\\bar{\\partial}\\phi = \\frac{i}{(1+|z|^2)^2} dz \\wedge d\\bar{z}\n$$\nFor a Kähler manifold, the components of the metric tensor $g$ in complex coordinates are given by $g_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}} = \\frac{\\partial^2\\phi}{\\partial z^\\alpha \\partial\\bar{z}^\\beta}$. In our case (complex dimension $n=1$), the single relevant component is:\n$$\ng_{z\\bar{z}} = \\frac{\\partial^2\\phi}{\\partial z \\partial\\bar{z}} = \\frac{1}{(1+|z|^2)^2}\n$$\nThe Kähler form and the metric are related by $\\omega = i \\sum_{\\alpha, \\beta} g_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}} dz^\\alpha \\wedge d\\bar{z}^\\beta$. For $n=1$, this is $\\omega = i g_{z\\bar{z}} dz \\wedge d\\bar{z}$, which is consistent with our calculation.\n\nThe next step is to compute the Ricci curvature. For a Kähler manifold, the Ricci form $\\rho$ is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\rho = -i \\partial\\bar{\\partial} \\ln(\\det(g_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}}))\n$$\nIn our case, the dimension is $n=1$, so the matrix of metric components $(g_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}})$ is just the scalar function $g_{z\\bar{z}}$. Thus, $\\det(g_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}}) = g_{z\\bar{z}}$.\n$$\n\\rho = -i \\partial\\bar{\\partial} \\ln(g_{z\\bar{z}})\n$$\nWe substitute the expression for $g_{z\\bar{z}}$:\n$$\n\\ln(g_{z\\bar{z}}) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{(1+|z|^2)^2}\\right) = \\ln((1+|z|^2)^{-2}) = -2\\ln(1+|z|^2) = -2\\phi\n$$\nNow, we compute the Ricci form:\n$$\n\\rho = -i \\partial\\bar{\\partial}(-2\\phi) = 2i \\partial\\bar{\\partial}\\phi\n$$\nSince we know that $\\omega = i\\partial\\bar{\\partial}\\phi$, we have a simple relation between the Ricci form and the Kähler form:\n$$\n\\rho = 2\\omega\n$$\nThe Ricci form can be expressed in terms of the components of the Ricci tensor $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}}$ as $\\rho = i \\sum_{\\alpha, \\beta} R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}} dz^\\alpha \\wedge d\\bar{z}^\\beta$. For $n=1$, this becomes $\\rho = i R_{z\\bar{z}} dz \\wedge d\\bar{z}$.\nComparing the two expressions for $\\rho$:\n$$\ni R_{z\\bar{z}} dz \\wedge d\\bar{z} = 2\\omega = 2(i g_{z\\bar{z}} dz \\wedge d\\bar{z})\n$$\nThis implies a direct relationship between the Ricci tensor component and the metric component:\n$$\nR_{z\\bar{z}} = 2 g_{z\\bar{z}}\n$$\nThe final step is to compute the Ricci scalar $S$, which is the trace of the Ricci tensor with respect to the metric. For a complex manifold of dimension $n=1$, the formula is:\n$$\nS = 2 g^{z\\bar{z}} R_{z\\bar{z}}\n$$\nwhere $g^{z\\bar{z}}$ is the component of the inverse metric, satisfying $g^{z\\bar{z}} g_{z\\bar{z}} = 1$. Thus, $g^{z\\bar{z}} = (g_{z\\bar{z}})^{-1}$.\nSubstituting $R_{z\\bar{z}} = 2 g_{z\\bar{z}}$ into the expression for $S$:\n$$\nS = 2 g^{z\\bar{z}} (2 g_{z\\bar{z}}) = 4 g^{z\\bar{z}} g_{z\\bar{z}} = 4\n$$\nThe Ricci scalar is a constant, $S=4$. For a real $2$-dimensional manifold (which corresponds to a complex $1$-dimensional manifold), the Ricci scalar $S$ is related to the Gaussian curvature $K$ by the formula $S = 2K$.\nTherefore:\n$$\n4 = 2K\n$$\nSolving for the Gaussian curvature $K$, we find:\n$$\nK = 2\n$$\nThe Gaussian curvature of $\\mathbb{CP}^{1}$ with the Fubini-Study metric derived from the specified potential is $2$.",
