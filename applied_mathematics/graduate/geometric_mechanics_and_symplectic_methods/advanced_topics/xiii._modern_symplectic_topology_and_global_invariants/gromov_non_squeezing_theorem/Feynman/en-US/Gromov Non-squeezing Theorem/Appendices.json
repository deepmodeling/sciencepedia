            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard problem in symplectic geometry concerning Gromov width and the non-squeezing theorem. The terminology used, such as Gromov width, symplectic capacity, and axioms, corresponds to established concepts, although some phrasing requires clarification based on standard definitions in the field. The solution will proceed by adopting the standard rigorous definitions as is conventional in symplectic geometry.\n\nThe Gromov width symplectic capacity, denoted $c_G$, of an open subset $U \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ is defined as the supremum of the areas of a $2$-disk for which the corresponding standard ball can be symplectically embedded into $U$. Explicitly,\n$$c_G(U) = \\sup\\{\\pi \\rho^2 \\mid \\exists \\phi: B^{2n}(\\rho) \\to U \\text{ such that } \\phi^*\\omega_0 = \\omega_0\\}$$\nwhere $B^{2n}(\\rho)$ is the open ball of radius $\\rho$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ and $\\omega_0$ is the standard symplectic form. We work in the case $n=2$. The axioms of symplectic capacity are properties derivable from this definition. In particular, the conformality axiom states $c_G(aU) = a^2c_G(U)$ for a scalar $a>0$, where $aU = \\{ax \\mid x \\in U\\}$.\n\n**1. Derivation of Capacities**\n\nFirst, we derive the capacity of the $4$-dimensional ball $B^4(R)$.\nBy the definition of Gromov width, $c_G(B^4(R)) = \\sup\\{\\pi \\rho^2 \\mid \\exists \\phi: B^4(\\rho) \\hookrightarrow B^4(R)\\}$.\nThe identity map provides a symplectic embedding of $B^4(\\rho)$ into $B^4(R)$ for any $\\rho \\le R$, because $B^4(\\rho)$ is a subset of $B^4(R)$ for such $\\rho$. This establishes a lower bound, showing we can achieve at least $\\rho=R$, so $c_G(B^4(R)) \\ge \\pi R^2$.\nFor an upper bound, any symplectomorphism $\\phi$ preserves the symplectic volume. The symplectic volume form on $\\mathbb{R}^4$ is $\\frac{1}{2!}\\omega_0 \\wedge \\omega_0 = (dq_1 \\wedge dp_1 + dq_2 \\wedge dp_2) \\wedge (dq_1 \\wedge dp_1 + dq_2 \\wedge dp_2) = 2 dq_1 \\wedge dp_1 \\wedge dq_2 \\wedge dp_2$, which is proportional to the Euclidean volume form. Since $\\phi(B^4(\\rho)) \\subset B^4(R)$, we must have $\\text{vol}(\\phi(B^4(\\rho))) \\le \\text{vol}(B^4(R))$. As $\\phi$ preserves volume, $\\text{vol}(B^4(\\rho)) \\le \\text{vol}(B^4(R))$. The Euclidean volume of a $4$-ball of radius $k$ is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi^2 k^4$. Thus, $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi^2 \\rho^4 \\le \\frac{1}{2}\\pi^2 R^4$, which implies $\\rho \\le R$. The supremum is thus taken at $\\rho=R$.\nTherefore, the Gromov width of the ball is $c_G(B^4(R)) = \\pi R^2$.\n\nNext, we derive the capacity of the symplectic cylinder $Z_1^4(r)$.\nBy definition, $c_G(Z_1^4(r)) = \\sup\\{\\pi \\rho^2 \\mid \\exists \\phi: B^4(\\rho) \\hookrightarrow Z_1^4(r)\\}$.\nGromov's non-squeezing theorem states that if a symplectic embedding $\\phi: B^{2n}(\\rho) \\to Z_1^{2n}(r)$ exists, then it must be that $\\pi \\rho^2 \\le \\pi r^2$, or $\\rho \\le r$. This provides an upper bound on the capacity: $c_G(Z_1^4(r)) \\le \\pi r^2$.\nTo find a lower bound, we check if a ball of radius $r$ can be embedded. Consider the identity map on $B^4(r)$. A point $(q_1, p_1, q_2, p_2) \\in B^4(r)$ satisfies $q_1^2+p_1^2+q_2^2+p_2^2 < r^2$. This implies $q_1^2+p_1^2 < r^2$, which is the condition for being in $Z_1^4(r)$. Thus, $B^4(r)$ is a subset of $Z_1^4(r)$, and the identity map is a symplectic embedding of $B^4(r)$ into $Z_1^4(r)$. This means we can achieve $\\rho=r$, so $c_G(Z_1^4(r)) \\ge \\pi r^2$.\nCombining the upper and lower bounds, we conclude that the Gromov width of the cylinder is $c_G(Z_1^4(r)) = \\pi r^2$.\n\n**2. Non-squeezing Condition for the Linear Map**\n\nWe are given the linear map $S_{\\lambda,\\mu}:\\mathbb{R}^{4}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ by $S_{\\lambda,\\mu}(q_{1},p_{1},q_{2},p_{2})=\\big(\\lambda\\,q_{1},\\,\\lambda^{-1}\\,p_{1},\\,\\mu\\,q_{2},\\,\\mu^{-1}\\,p_{2}\\big)$. This map is a linear symplectomorphism.\nWe consider the image of the ball $B^4(R)$ under this map. Let $(q'_1, p'_1, q'_2, p'_2) = S_{\\lambda,\\mu}(q_1, p_1, q_2, p_2)$. The point $(q_1,p_1,q_2,p_2)$ is in $B^4(R)$, so it satisfies $q_1^2+p_1^2+q_2^2+p_2^2 < R^2$.\nThe coordinates in the original space can be expressed as $q_1=\\lambda^{-1}q'_1$, $p_1=\\lambda p'_1$, $q_2=\\mu^{-1}q'_2$, $p_2=\\mu p'_2$. Substituting these into the inequality for the ball gives the equation for the image set $S_{\\lambda,\\mu}(B^4(R))$:\n$$(\\lambda^{-1}q'_1)^2 + (\\lambda p'_1)^2 + (\\mu^{-1}q'_2)^2 + (\\mu p'_2)^2 < R^2$$\nThis is the interior of a $4$-dimensional ellipsoid.\n\nThe orthogonal projection of this ellipsoid onto the $(q'_1, p'_1)$-plane consists of all points $(q'_1, p'_1)$ for which there exist $(q'_2, p'_2)$ satisfying the inequality. This is possible if and only if $(\\lambda^{-1}q'_1)^2 + (\\lambda p'_1)^2 < R^2$.\nThis inequality describes the interior of an ellipse in the $(q'_1,p'_1)$-plane. We can write it in standard form as:\n$$\\frac{(q'_1)^2}{(\\lambda R)^2} + \\frac{(p'_1)^2}{(\\lambda^{-1}R)^2} < 1$$\nThe semi-axes of this ellipse are $a = \\lambda R$ and $b = \\lambda^{-1}R$. The area of this ellipse is $\\pi a b = \\pi (\\lambda R)(\\lambda^{-1}R) = \\pi R^2$.\n\nThe non-squeezing theorem states that for any symplectic embedding $\\phi: B^{2n}(R) \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, the area of the projection of the image $\\phi(B^{2n}(R))$ onto any canonical $2$-plane $(q_j, p_j)$ is at least $\\pi R^2$. The map $S_{\\lambda,\\mu}$ is one such symplectic embedding (specifically, a linear one). Our calculation shows that the area of the projection of its image $S_{\\lambda,\\mu}(B^4(R))$ onto the $(q_1, p_1)$-plane is exactly $\\pi R^2$. This demonstrates that the map $S_{\\lambda,\\mu}$ saturates the lower bound provided by Gromov's theorem, thus verifying it for this specific linear case.\n\nNow, we determine the minimal radius $r_{\\min}$ such that $S_{\\lambda,\\mu}(B^4(R))$ can be symplectically embedded into the cylinder $Z_1^4(r)$. Let this embedding be $\\psi: S_{\\lambda,\\mu}(B^4(R)) \\hookrightarrow Z_1^4(r)$.\nThe composition $\\Phi = \\psi \\circ S_{\\lambda,\\mu}$ is a symplectic embedding of $B^4(R)$ into $Z_1^4(r)$.\nThe existence of such an embedding is governed by the monotonicity property of symplectic capacity: if a set $U$ can be symplectically embedded in a set $V$, then $c_G(U) \\le c_G(V)$.\nApplying this to our composition $\\Phi$, we must have $c_G(B^4(R)) \\le c_G(Z_1^4(r))$.\nUsing the results from Part 1, this condition becomes $\\pi R^2 \\le \\pi r^2$, which simplifies to $R \\le r$.\nTherefore, a symplectic embedding is only possible if $r \\ge R$. The minimal radius is $r_{\\min}=R$.\nIf $r < r_{\\min}$, i.e., $r < R$, the condition $c_G(B^4(R)) \\le c_G(Z_1^4(r))$ is violated. This means no such symplectic embedding can exist. This is a direct consequence of the non-squeezing theorem.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the expression $c_{G}(Z_{1}^{4}(r)) - c_{G}(B^{4}(R))$. Using our derived values:\n$$c_{G}(Z_{1}^{4}(r)) - c_{G}(B^{4}(R)) = \\pi r^2 - \\pi R^2 = \\pi(r^2 - R^2)$$",

It is a standard, non-trivial exercise in applying a major theorem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to find a lower bound on the radius $a$ of the symplectic cylinder $Z^{2n}(a)$ given that there exists a symplectic embedding $\\Phi: A_{r,R}^{2n} \\to Z^{2n}(a)$. The derivation will follow the course outlined in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we recall the properties of a symplectic embedding. If $\\Phi: V \\to W$ is a symplectic embedding between two symplectic manifolds $(V, \\omega_V)$ and $(W, \\omega_W)$, then $\\Phi^*\\omega_W = \\omega_V$. If $U \\subset V$ is an open subset, the restriction of $\\Phi$ to $U$, denoted $\\Phi|_U: U \\to W$, is also a symplectic embedding (where $U$ is equipped with the restricted symplectic form $\\omega_V|_U$).\n\nThe problem directs us to use Gromov's non-squeezing theorem, which concerns the embedding of a ball into a cylinder. Our domain is a spherical shell $A_{r,R}^{2n}$. To apply the theorem, we must first find a Euclidean ball that can be contained within this shell. Let $B^{2n}(c, \\rho)$ denote the open ball in $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ with center $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ and radius $\\rho > 0$:\n$$\nB^{2n}(c, \\rho) = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2n} \\,|\\, \\|z - c\\| < \\rho\\}\n$$\nWe seek the largest possible radius $\\rho$ such that for some center $c$, the ball $B^{2n}(c, \\rho)$ is a subset of the shell $A_{r,R}^{2n}$. The condition $B^{2n}(c, \\rho) \\subset A_{r,R}^{2n}$ means that for every point $z \\in B^{2n}(c, \\rho)$, we must have $r < \\|z\\| < R$.\n\nLet us analyze the geometric constraints on $c$ and $\\rho$.\n1.  For any $z \\in B^{2n}(c, \\rho)$, its norm $\\|z\\|$ must be less than $R$. By the triangle inequality, we have:\n    $$\n    \\|z\\| = \\|(z - c) + c\\| \\le \\|z - c\\| + \\|c\\|\n    $$\n    Since $\\|z - c\\| < \\rho$ for all $z$ in the open ball, the supremum of $\\|z\\|$ is bounded by $\\|c\\| + \\rho$. To ensure that $\\|z\\| < R$ for all $z$, we must have the boundary of the ball contained within the closure of the target, i.e., $\\|c\\| + \\rho \\le R$.\n\n2.  For any $z \\in B^{2n}(c, \\rho)$, its norm $\\|z\\|$ must be greater than $r$. By the reverse triangle inequality, we have:\n    $$\n    \\|z\\| = \\|c - (c - z)\\| \\ge |\\|c\\| - \\|c - z\\||\n    $$\n    To ensure $\\|z\\| > r$, the infimum of $\\|z\\|$ within the ball must be greater than $r$. The infimum of $\\|z\\|$ over $z \\in B^{2n}(c, \\rho)$ is greater than $\\|c\\| - \\rho$ (if $\\|c\\| \\ge \\rho$) or $0$ (if $\\|c\\| < \\rho$). To avoid the origin, we must have $\\|c\\| \\ge \\rho$. In this case, to ensure $\\|z\\| > r$, we require the limit point at the boundary to satisfy $\\|c\\| - \\rho \\ge r$.\n\nCombining these two conditions, the center $c$ and radius $\\rho$ of a ball contained in the shell must satisfy:\n$$\n\\|c\\| + \\rho \\le R \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\|c\\| - \\rho \\ge r\n$$\nFrom these inequalities, we can bound the norm of the center:\n$$\nr + \\rho \\le \\|c\\| \\le R - \\rho\n$$\nFor a center $c$ satisfying these constraints to exist, the lower bound for its norm must be less than or equal to the upper bound:\n$$\nr + \\rho \\le R - \\rho\n$$\nSolving for $\\rho$, we get:\n$$\n2\\rho \\le R - r \\implies \\rho \\le \\frac{R-r}{2}\n$$\nThis shows that the maximum possible radius of a Euclidean ball that can be placed inside the spherical shell $A_{r,R}^{2n}$ is $\\rho_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{R-r}{2}$. This result is independent of the dimension $n$.\n\nWe can explicitly construct such a ball. Let $\\rho = \\frac{R-r}{2}$. Choose a center $c$ such that $\\|c\\| = r + \\rho = r + \\frac{R-r}{2} = \\frac{R+r}{2}$. Let $B_0 = B^{2n}(c, \\rho)$. For any $z \\in B_0$:\n-   $\\|z\\| \\le \\|z-c\\| + \\|c\\| < \\rho + \\|c\\| = \\frac{R-r}{2} + \\frac{R+r}{2} = R$.\n-   $\\|z\\| \\ge \\|c\\| - \\|z-c\\| > \\|c\\| - \\rho = \\frac{R+r}{2} - \\frac{R-r}{2} = r$.\nThus, $r < \\|z\\| < R$, which confirms that $B_0 \\subset A_{r,R}^{2n}$.\n\nNow, we use the existence of the symplectic embedding $\\Phi: A_{r,R}^{2n} \\to Z^{2n}(a)$. Since $B_0 \\subset A_{r,R}^{2n}$, the restriction of $\\Phi$ to $B_0$, denoted $\\Phi|_{B_0}$, provides a symplectic embedding of the ball $B_0$ into the cylinder $Z^{2n}(a)$.\n$$\n\\Phi|_{B_0}: B_0 \\to Z^{2n}(a)\n$$\nThe ball $B_0$ is a standard Euclidean ball of radius $\\rho = \\frac{R-r}{2}$. The target space $Z^{2n}(a)$ is a symplectic cylinder of radius $a$.\n\nAt this point, we apply Gromov's non-squeezing theorem. The theorem states that if a symplectic embedding of an open ball of radius $\\rho$, $B^{2n}(\\rho)$, into a symplectic cylinder $Z^{2n}(a)$ exists, then the radius of the ball cannot exceed the radius of the cylinder. Mathematically:\n$$\n\\rho \\le a\n$$\nThis condition is equivalent to the statement on areas: $\\pi\\rho^2 \\le \\pi a^2$.\n\nApplying this theorem to our situation, with $\\rho = \\frac{R-r}{2}$, we obtain the inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{R-r}{2} \\le a\n$$\nThis inequality provides a quantitative lower bound on the radius $a$ of the cylinder. The value of $a$ must be at least $\\frac{R-r}{2}$. This lower bound depends only on $r$ and $R$ and is independent of the dimension $2n$, as required.\n\nTherefore, a certified quantitative lower bound on $a$ is $\\frac{R-r}{2}$.",

The matrix $Q$ is given as $Q = \\begin{pmatrix} A_{1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & A_{2} \\end{pmatrix}$ with $A_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $A_{2} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe Hamiltonian matrix is:\n$$\nJQ = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & I_{2} \\\\ -I_{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} A_{1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & A_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & A_{2} \\\\ -A_{1} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $JQ$ are the roots of the characteristic polynomial $p(\\lambda) = \\det(JQ - \\lambda I_{4}) = 0$.\n$$\np(\\lambda) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -\\lambda I_{2} & A_{2} \\\\ -A_{1} & -\\lambda I_{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nUsing the determinant property for block matrices, we have:\n$$\np(\\lambda) = \\det(\\lambda^{2}I_{2} + A_{1}A_{2})\n$$\nWe first compute the product $A_{1}A_{2}$:\n$$\nA_{1}A_{2} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (3)(2)+(1)(0) & (3)(0)+(1)(1) \\\\ (1)(2)+(3)(0) & (1)(0)+(3)(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 6 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we compute the determinant:\n$$\np(\\lambda) = \\det \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda^{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda^{2} \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 6 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda^{2}+6 & 1 \\\\ 2 & \\lambda^{2}+3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\np(\\lambda) = (\\lambda^{2}+6)(\\lambda^{2}+3) - (1)(2) = \\lambda^{4} + 9\\lambda^{2} + 18 - 2 = \\lambda^{4} + 9\\lambda^{2} + 16\n$$\nThe characteristic equation is $\\lambda^{4} + 9\\lambda^{2} + 16 = 0$. Let $\\mu = \\lambda^{2}$. The equation becomes a quadratic in $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mu^{2} + 9\\mu + 16 = 0\n$$\nUsing the quadratic formula for $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{-9 \\pm \\sqrt{9^{2} - 4(1)(16)}}{2} = \\frac{-9 \\pm \\sqrt{81-64}}{2} = \\frac{-9 \\pm \\sqrt{17}}{2}\n$$\nSo, the values for $\\lambda^{2}$ are $\\mu_{1} = \\frac{-9-\\sqrt{17}}{2}$ and $\\mu_{2} = \\frac{-9+\\sqrt{17}}{2}$. Since $Q$ is positive-definite, the eigenvalues of $JQ$ are purely imaginary, $\\lambda = \\pm i\\omega_{j}$, which implies $\\lambda^{2} = -\\omega_{j}^{2}$ must be real and negative. Indeed, since $\\sqrt{17} < \\sqrt{81}=9$, both values of $\\mu$ are negative.\n\nThe Williamson invariants $\\omega_{j}$ are the positive roots of $-\\mu$. Let us order them such that $\\omega_{1} \\leq \\omega_{2}$.\n$$\n\\omega_{1}^{2} = -\\mu_{2} = - \\left( \\frac{-9+\\sqrt{17}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{9-\\sqrt{17}}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_{2}^{2} = -\\mu_{1} = - \\left( \\frac{-9-\\sqrt{17}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{9+\\sqrt{17}}{2}\n$$\nThe Williamson invariants are the positive square roots:\n$$\n\\omega_{1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{9-\\sqrt{17}}{2}}, \\quad \\omega_{2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{9+\\sqrt{17}}{2}}\n$$\n\n**2) Gromov Width from Williamson Invariants**\n\nThe change of coordinates $x = Sy$ is a symplectomorphism. It transforms the ellipsoid $E_{Q}$ into a new ellipsoid $E_{D}$:\n$$\nx^{\\mathsf{T}}Qx \\leq 1 \\iff (Sy)^{\\mathsf{T}}Q(Sy) \\leq 1 \\iff y^{\\mathsf{T}}(S^{\\mathsf{T}}QS)y \\leq 1 \\iff y^{\\mathsf{T}}Dy \\leq 1\n$$\nIn Darboux coordinates $y=(q_{1}, q_{2}, p_{1}, p_{2})$, the condition $y^{\\mathsf{T}}Dy \\leq 1$ is:\n$$\n\\omega_{1}q_{1}^{2} + \\omega_{2}q_{2}^{2} + \\omega_{1}p_{1}^{2} + \\omega_{2}p_{2}^{2} \\leq 1 \\implies \\omega_{1}(q_{1}^{2}+p_{1}^{2}) + \\omega_{2}(q_{2}^{2}+p_{2}^{2}) \\leq 1\n$$\nThe Gromov width $c_{0}(E_Q)$ is equal to $c_{0}(E_D)$ because symplectic capacities are invariant under symplectomorphisms. The Gromov non-squeezing theorem fundamentally states that the area of projection of a symplectically embedded ball onto any canonical coordinate plane is bounded. For an ellipsoid of the form $E_D$, the Gromov width is given by the capacity of the largest ball $B^{4}(R) = \\{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4} \\mid q_{1}^{2}+p_{1}^{2}+q_{2}^{2}+p_{2}^{2} \\leq R^{2}\\}$ that can be embedded into it.\n\nThe embedding condition is: if $q_{1}^{2}+p_{1}^{2}+q_{2}^{2}+p_{2}^{2} \\leq R^{2}$, then $\\omega_{1}(q_{1}^{2}+p_{1}^{2}) + \\omega_{2}(q_{2}^{2}+p_{2}^{2}) \\leq 1$.\nLet $u_{1} = q_{1}^{2}+p_{1}^{2}$ and $u_{2} = q_{2}^{2}+p_{2}^{2}$. We are looking for the largest $R^{2}$ such that for all $u_{1}, u_{2} \\geq 0$ with $u_{1}+u_{2} \\leq R^{2}$, the inequality $\\omega_{1}u_{1} + \\omega_{2}u_{2} \\leq 1$ holds.\nThe expression $f(u_{1}, u_{2}) = \\omega_{1}u_{1} + \\omega_{2}u_{2}$ is linear. Its maximum over the triangular region defined by $u_{1} \\geq 0, u_{2} \\geq 0, u_{1}+u_{2} \\leq R^{2}$ is achieved at a vertex. The vertices are $(0,0)$, $(R^{2},0)$, and $(0,R^{2})$.\nAt $(R^{2},0)$: $\\omega_{1}R^{2} \\leq 1 \\implies R^{2} \\leq \\frac{1}{\\omega_{1}}$.\nAt $(0,R^{2})$: $\\omega_{2}R^{2} \\le 1 \\implies R^{2} \\leq \\frac{1}{\\omega_{2}}$.\nTo satisfy both, we must have $R^{2} \\leq \\min\\left(\\frac{1}{\\omega_{1}}, \\frac{1}{\\omega_{2}}\\right)$.\nThe largest possible value for $R^{2}$ is $R_{\\max}^{2} = \\min\\left(\\frac{1}{\\omega_{1}}, \\frac{1}{\\omega_{2}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\max(\\omega_{1}, \\omega_{2})}$.\nSince $\\omega_{2} > \\omega_{1}$, the maximum is $\\omega_{2}$. Thus, $R_{\\max}^{2} = \\frac{1}{\\omega_{2}}$.\n\nThe Gromov width is defined as $c_{0}(E_{Q}) = \\pi R_{\\max}^{2}$. Therefore,\n$$\nc_{0}(E_{Q}) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega_{2}} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\frac{9+\\sqrt{17}}{2}}}\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we denest the radical. For a radical of the form $\\sqrt{A+\\sqrt{B}}$, the denested form is $\\sqrt{\\frac{A+C}{2}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{A-C}{2}}$ where $C=\\sqrt{A^{2}-B}$.\nFor $\\sqrt{9+\\sqrt{17}}$, we have $A=9$ and $B=17$. So, $C=\\sqrt{9^{2}-17} = \\sqrt{81-17} = \\sqrt{64}=8$.\nThus, $\\sqrt{9+\\sqrt{17}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{9+8}{2}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{9-8}{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{17}{2}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{17}+1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\omega_{2}$:\n$$\n\\omega_{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{9+\\sqrt{17}}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(\\sqrt{17}+1)/\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{17}+1}{2}\n$$\nThe Gromov width is then:\n$$\nc_{0}(E_{Q}) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega_{2}} = \\frac{\\pi}{(\\sqrt{17}+1)/2} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{17}+1}\n$$\nFinally, we rationalize the denominator:\n$$\nc_{0}(E_{Q}) = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{17}+1} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{17}-1}{\\sqrt{17}-1} = \\frac{2\\pi(\\sqrt{17}-1)}{17-1^{2}} = \\frac{2pi(\\sqrt{17}-1)}{16} = \\frac{\\pi(\\sqrt{17}-1)}{8}\n$$\n\nThe Williamson invariants are $\\omega_{1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{17}-1}{2}$ and $\\omega_{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{17}+1}{2}$. The Gromov width of $E_{Q}$ is determined by the larger of these two invariants, $\\omega_{2}$.",
