## Introduction
Homological Mirror Symmetry (HMS) represents a revolutionary conjecture in modern mathematics, proposing a profound and unexpected bridge between the seemingly disparate worlds of symplectic geometry and [complex algebraic geometry](@entry_id:158188). Originating from ideas in string theory, [mirror symmetry](@entry_id:158730) initially predicted surprising equalities between [numerical invariants](@entry_id:752800) of mirror-paired manifolds. HMS deepens this connection immensely, elevating it from a numerical correspondence to a structural equivalence at the categorical level. This shift addresses the fundamental question of *why* these numerical coincidences occur, revealing a shared algebraic backbone governing both geometries.

This article provides a comprehensive exploration of Homological Mirror Symmetry, structured to build understanding from foundational principles to practical applications. In "Principles and Mechanisms," we will dissect the two sides of the mirror: the A-model's Fukaya category, built from Lagrangian [submanifolds](@entry_id:159439) and Floer theory, and the B-model's [derived category of coherent sheaves](@entry_id:1123570). Following this, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" will demonstrate the conjecture's power, showing how it transforms intractable problems in one domain into solvable ones in the other and uncovers unifying structures across mathematics and physics. Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will ground these abstract concepts in concrete computational examples, offering a practical path to mastering the core techniques of both the A- and B-models.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Homological Mirror Symmetry (HMS) elevates the predictions of [mirror symmetry](@entry_id:158730) from a correspondence between [numerical invariants](@entry_id:752800) to a profound equivalence at the categorical level. This equivalence connects two fundamentally different mathematical worlds: the A-model of symplectic geometry and the B-model of [complex algebraic geometry](@entry_id:158188). This chapter elucidates the core principles and mechanisms of HMS, detailing the structure of the categories involved and the nature of their predicted equivalence. We will dissect the constituent parts of the conjecture, illustrate its mechanics through foundational examples, and explore some of its deeper structural consequences.

### The A-Model: The Fukaya Category

The natural setting for the A-model in [symplectic topology](@entry_id:1132760) is the **Fukaya category**, denoted $\mathcal{F}(X)$, associated with a symplectic manifold $(X, \omega)$. This is not a category in the classical sense but an **$A_{\infty}$-category**, a structure that encodes composition laws that are associative only up to a coherent system of higher homotopies.

#### Objects: Lagrangian Branes

The objects of the Fukaya category are **Lagrangian [submanifolds](@entry_id:159439)** of $X$, which are submanifolds $L$ of half the dimension of $X$ on which the symplectic form vanishes, i.e., $\omega|_L = 0$. However, a bare Lagrangian is not sufficient. A proper object in $\mathcal{F}(X)$, often called a **Lagrangian brane**, must be endowed with additional structure. This typically includes an orientation, a [spin structure](@entry_id:157768), and most importantly, a grading and a flat unitary [line bundle](@entry_id:1127303) (a local system). These decorations are essential for defining well-behaved morphism spaces and for matching structures on the B-model side .

#### Morphisms: Floer Cohomology

For two transverse Lagrangian branes $L_0$ and $L_1$, the morphism space $\mathrm{Hom}(L_0, L_1)$ is not merely a set but a [cochain](@entry_id:275805) complex, specifically the **Floer [cochain](@entry_id:275805) complex** $CF^*(L_0, L_1)$. This complex is a vector space (or module over a coefficient ring) generated by the intersection points of the two Lagrangians:
$$
CF^*(L_0, L_1) = \bigoplus_{p \in L_0 \cap L_1} \mathbb{K} \cdot p
$$
where $\mathbb{K}$ is a chosen field of coefficients. The differential $\delta: CF^k \to CF^{k+1}$ on this complex is defined by "counting" [pseudo-holomorphic strips](@entry_id:162091)—maps $u: \mathbb{R} \times [0,1] \to X$ satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equation—with boundary conditions on $L_0$ and $L_1$. The cohomology of this complex is the **Floer cohomology**, $HF^*(L_0, L_1)$.

In certain highly symmetric situations, the Floer differential can be shown to vanish. A foundational example is the symplectic two-torus $M = \mathbb{T}^2 = \mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}^2$ with its standard area form $\omega = dx \wedge dy$. Consider two Lagrangian circles, $L_1$ and $L_2$, arising from the projection of straight lines in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with primitive integer slope vectors $(p,q)$ and $(r,s)$. The number of transverse intersection points is given by the absolute value of the determinant of these vectors, which represents the algebraic [intersection number](@entry_id:161199):
$$
\#(L_1 \cap L_2) = |ps - qr|
$$
For this flat geometry, one can show that there are no non-constant [pseudo-holomorphic strips](@entry_id:162091) connecting intersection points. With trivial local systems, the Floer differential $\delta$ is identically zero. Consequently, the Floer cohomology is isomorphic to the [chain complex](@entry_id:150246) itself, and its total dimension is simply the number of intersection points  :
$$
\dim HF^*(L_1, L_2) = \#(L_1 \cap L_2) = |ps - qr|
$$

#### Grading and the Maslov Class

The grading on the Floer complex, which assigns an integer degree to each intersection point generator, is a subtle but crucial element. It is determined by the **Maslov index**. For a closed Lagrangian $L$, this index is governed by the **Maslov class**, $\mu_L \in H^1(L; \mathbb{Z})$. The possibility of defining an absolute $\mathbb{Z}$-grading on the Fukaya category of a closed symplectic manifold $X$ (rather than just a $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-grading) is contingent on the vanishing of the first Chern class of its tangent bundle, $c_1(TX)=0$, along with a choice of "grading data" .

The Maslov class can be computed from the **Lagrangian angle**, a [phase function](@entry_id:1129581) that arises when comparing the [volume form](@entry_id:161784) of the Lagrangian with a fixed holomorphic [volume form](@entry_id:161784) on the [ambient space](@entry_id:184743). Let us consider the Lagrangian torus $L_{\mathbf{r}} = \{ (z_1, \dots, z_n) \in \mathbb{C}^n : |z_j| = r_j \}$ in $(\mathbb{C}^n, \omega_0)$. The standard holomorphic [volume form](@entry_id:161784) is $\Omega = dz_1 \wedge \dots \wedge dz_n$. Its restriction to $L_{\mathbf{r}}$ relates to the Riemannian [volume form](@entry_id:161784) $\mathrm{vol}_{L_{\mathbf{r}}}$ by a phase factor: $\Omega|_{L_{\mathbf{r}}} = \exp(\mathrm{i} \vartheta) \mathrm{vol}_{L_{\mathbf{r}}}$. A direct calculation shows that the Lagrangian angle $\vartheta$ is given by $\vartheta(\theta_1, \dots, \theta_n) = \frac{n\pi}{2} + \sum_{k=1}^n \theta_k$. The Maslov class of $L_{\mathbf{r}}$ is the [cohomology class](@entry_id:263961) of the 1-form $\frac{1}{\pi}d\vartheta$. Its evaluation on the $j$-th fundamental cycle $\gamma_j$ of the torus (a loop where only $\theta_j$ varies from $0$ to $2\pi$) is:
$$
\langle \mu_{L_{\mathbf{r}}}, [\gamma_j] \rangle = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{\gamma_j} d\vartheta = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta_j = 2
$$
This integer value is a measure of how the tangent planes of the Lagrangian twist relative to the [complex structure](@entry_id:269128) as one traverses a loop .

#### Composition and $A_{\infty}$-Structure

The composition of morphisms in the Fukaya category is defined by counting pseudo-holomorphic polygons. For three Lagrangians $L_0, L_1, L_2$, the product $\mu^2: HF^*(L_0, L_1) \otimes HF^*(L_1, L_2) \to HF^*(L_0, L_2)$ is defined by counting pseudo-holomorphic triangles with boundaries on the three Lagrangians. This composition is generally not strictly associative. That is, $(\mu^2(c,b)) \mu^2(a)$ is not equal to $\mu^2(c, \mu^2(b,a))$. Instead, they are related by a higher-order operation, $\mu^3$, which counts pseudo-holomorphic quadrilaterals. This pattern continues, leading to an infinite sequence of higher-product maps $\{\mu^k\}_{k\ge 1}$ that satisfy the $A_\infty$-relations, making $\mathcal{F}(X)$ a strongly homotopy associative category.

### The B-Model: The Derived Category of Coherent Sheaves

The B-model in [complex algebraic geometry](@entry_id:158188) is described by the **bounded [derived category of coherent sheaves](@entry_id:1123570)**, denoted $D^b\mathrm{Coh}(Y)$, on a [complex manifold](@entry_id:261516) $Y$. This is a sophisticated construction that elegantly handles complexes of sheaves and their morphisms.

#### Objects and Morphisms

The objects of $D^b\mathrm{Coh}(Y)$ are bounded complexes of [coherent sheaves](@entry_id:158020). Coherent sheaves are a generalization of holomorphic [vector bundles](@entry_id:159617) and include important objects like **skyscraper sheaves** $\mathcal{O}_p$, which are supported at a single point $p \in Y$. The morphisms in this category are not simply maps of complexes. Instead, morphisms between two objects $\mathcal{E}^\bullet$ and $\mathcal{F}^\bullet$ are given by derived Hom-[functors](@entry_id:150427), which compute the **Ext groups**, $\mathrm{Ext}^i(\mathcal{E}^\bullet, \mathcal{F}^\bullet)$. $D^b\mathrm{Coh}(Y)$ has the structure of a **triangulated category**, where short [exact sequences](@entry_id:151503) of complexes are replaced by a distinguished class of sequences called exact (or distinguished) triangles.

#### Calculations in the B-Model

One of the powerful tools for performing calculations in $D^b\mathrm{Coh}(Y)$ is the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch (HRR) theorem. It computes the Euler characteristic of the Ext groups between two objects. For an [elliptic curve](@entry_id:163260) $E$ (a complex 1-torus), the canonical bundle is trivial, which simplifies the HRR formula significantly. The Euler characteristic between two [vector bundles](@entry_id:159617) $V_1$ and $V_2$ on $E$ is given by:
$$
\chi(V_1, V_2) = \sum_{i=0}^1 (-1)^i \dim \mathrm{Ext}^i(V_1, V_2) = \mathrm{rank}(V_1)\deg(V_2) - \mathrm{rank}(V_2)\deg(V_1)
$$
This formula is linear with respect to objects in the Grothendieck group $K_0(E)$. For instance, if an object $E'$ is defined as the cone of a morphism between two [line bundles](@entry_id:1127304), $L_2 \to L_1$, its class in $K_0(E)$ is $[L_1] - [L_2]$. Its Euler characteristic pairing with another bundle $F$ is then simply $\chi(E', F) = \chi(L_1, F) - \chi(L_2, F)$, which can be readily computed using the formula above .

### The Homological Mirror Symmetry Conjecture

With the A-model and B-model categories defined, we can state the central conjecture, first proposed by Maxim Kontsevich.

#### The Main Statement

Homological Mirror Symmetry postulates that for a mirror pair of a symplectic manifold $(X, \omega)$ and a [complex manifold](@entry_id:261516) $Y$, there is an equivalence of triangulated categories between the derived Fukaya category of $X$ and the bounded [derived category of coherent sheaves](@entry_id:1123570) on $Y$:
$$
D^\pi\mathcal{F}(X) \simeq D^b\mathrm{Coh}(Y)
$$
Here, $D^\pi\mathcal{F}(X)$ is the **split-closed derived category** (or triangulated envelope) of the $A_\infty$-category $\mathcal{F}(X)$. This formal procedure of taking twisted complexes and then idempotent completion (split-closure) is necessary to produce a triangulated category that has all the expected properties to be equivalent to an algebraic one like $D^b\mathrm{Coh}(Y)$ . This is a very strong statement: it implies that not only are the objects in correspondence, but the intricate web of morphisms (Floer cohomology on one side, Ext groups on the other) is also preserved.

#### A Case Study: The Torus and the Elliptic Curve

The first, and still most fundamental, testing ground for HMS is the [mirror symmetry](@entry_id:158730) between a symplectic [2-torus](@entry_id:265991) $(T^2, \omega)$ and a complex [elliptic curve](@entry_id:163260) $E$. This case perfectly illustrates the dictionary between the A- and B-models .
Under this correspondence:
- An object on the A-side, a Lagrangian circle brane $L_{(p,q)}$ of slope $p/q$ (with primitive integers $p,q$) equipped with a trivial local system, is mirrored to an object on the B-side, a stable [holomorphic vector bundle](@entry_id:203608) $E_{(q,p)}$ on the [elliptic curve](@entry_id:163260) $E$ with rank $q$ and degree $p$.

This correspondence extends to the level of morphisms. We can test this by comparing the dimensions of the morphism spaces. On the A-side, the total dimension of Floer cohomology between two Lagrangian branes $L_{(p,q)}$ and $L_{(p',q')}$ is their [intersection number](@entry_id:161199):
$$
\dim HF^*(L_{(p,q)}, L_{(p',q')}) = |pq' - p'q|
$$
On the B-side, the corresponding objects are the [vector bundles](@entry_id:159617) $E_{(q,p)}$ and $E_{(q',p')}$. The total dimension of the Ext groups between them can be computed. The Riemann-Roch theorem gives the Euler characteristic:
$$
\chi(E_{(q,p)}, E_{(q',p')}) = \mathrm{rank}(E_{(q,p)})\deg(E_{(q',p')}) - \mathrm{rank}(E_{(q',p')})\deg(E_{(q,p)}) = qp' - q'p
$$
Because the bundles are stable and have different slopes ($\mu = p/q \neq p'/q'$), either $\mathrm{Hom}$ or $\mathrm{Ext}^1$ must vanish. Therefore, the total dimension of the Ext groups is the absolute value of the Euler characteristic:
$$
\sum_{i=0}^1 \dim \mathrm{Ext}^i(E_{(q,p)}, E_{(q',p')}) = |qp' - q'p|
$$
The perfect agreement, $|pq' - p'q| = |qp' - q'p|$, provides compelling evidence for the HMS conjecture in this setting .

### Deeper Structures and Extensions

The HMS conjecture is not just about identifying objects and morphisms; it also predicts that deeper structures inherent to each category should correspond.

#### Serre Functors and Duality

Triangulated categories arising from geometry possess a special autoequivalence called the **Serre [functor](@entry_id:260898)**, which encodes a form of duality. For $D^b\mathrm{Coh}(Y)$ of a smooth projective variety of dimension $n$, the Serre [functor](@entry_id:260898) is given by tensoring with the canonical bundle $K_Y$ and shifting by the dimension: $S_Y(-) = (-) \otimes K_Y[n]$. For a **Calabi-Yau manifold**, the canonical bundle is trivial, $K_Y \cong \mathcal{O}_Y$. Thus, the Serre [functor](@entry_id:260898) simplifies to just the shift [functor](@entry_id:260898), $S_Y \cong [n]$.

The HMS equivalence $\mathcal{F}(X) \simeq D^b\mathrm{Coh}(Y)$ implies that the Serre [functor](@entry_id:260898) on the Fukaya side, $S_X$, must also be the shift [functor](@entry_id:260898) $[n]$. This has a profound consequence for the Floer [cohomology groups](@entry_id:142450). The defining property of the Serre [functor](@entry_id:260898) translates to a duality relation on the A-model side, mirroring Serre duality on the B-model side:
$$
(HF^k(L_0, L_1))^* \cong HF^{n-k}(L_1, L_0)
$$
This demonstrates how a geometric property of the B-model manifold (triviality of $K_Y$) dictates a fundamental algebraic property of the A-model category .

#### Open-Closed String Maps and the Cardy Relation

HMS is part of a larger physical picture of string theory, which involves not just open strings (ending on branes) but also closed strings (propagating in the [ambient space](@entry_id:184743)). This is reflected mathematically in the existence of **open-closed maps**. The **closed-[open map](@entry_id:155659)** $\mathrm{CO}: QH^*(X) \to HH^*(\mathcal{F}(X))$ sends closed-string states ([quantum cohomology](@entry_id:157750) classes) to open-string operators (Hochschild cohomology classes of the Fukaya category). The **open-[closed map](@entry_id:150357)** $\mathrm{OC}: HH_*(\mathcal{F}(X)) \to QH^*(X)$ sends open-string states to closed-string states.

These maps are connected by the **Cardy relation**, which states that the natural pairings on both sides are compatible: $\langle \mathrm{OC}(a), b \rangle_{QH} = \langle a, \mathrm{CO}(b) \rangle_{HH}$. This relation can be used to compute invariants. For example, the pairing of $\mathrm{OC}([L])$ (the closed-string state corresponding to a brane $L$) with the [quantum cohomology](@entry_id:157750) unit $1_{QH}$ can be computed as:
$$
\langle \mathrm{OC}([L]), 1_{QH} \rangle_{QH} = \langle [L], \mathrm{CO}(1_{QH}) \rangle_{HH} = \langle [L], 1_{HH} \rangle_{HH} = \chi(HF^*(L,L))
$$
This equates a closed-string invariant to the Euler characteristic of the Lagrangian's Floer cohomology. For monotone Lagrangians like $\mathbb{R}P^2$ in $\mathbb{C}P^2$, where $HF^*(L,L) \cong H^*(L)$, this allows a computation purely from the topology of the Lagrangian itself .

#### Landau-Ginzburg Models and Deformations

The classic statement of HMS applies to Calabi-Yau manifolds, where the mirror is another Calabi-Yau. For non-Calabi-Yau manifolds, such as Fano or general type, the mirror is often a **Landau-Ginzburg model** $(Y, W)$, a [complex manifold](@entry_id:261516) $Y$ equipped with a [holomorphic function](@entry_id:164375) $W: Y \to \mathbb{C}$ called the **[superpotential](@entry_id:149670)**. The Calabi-Yau case corresponds to $W=0$.

On the A-side, the [superpotential](@entry_id:149670) arises from pseudo-holomorphic disks. For a Lagrangian $L \subset X$, the [superpotential](@entry_id:149670) is a generating function counting Maslov index 2 disks with boundary on $L$:
$$
W(y) = \sum_{\beta \in \pi_2(X,L), \mu(\beta)=2} n_\beta T^{\omega(\beta)} y^{\langle \partial\beta, \gamma \rangle}
$$
Here, $y$ is a coordinate on the space of flat [line bundles](@entry_id:1127304) on $L$, and $T$ is a formal variable tracking symplectic area. The critical points of this function, where $dW/dy = 0$, correspond to solutions of the **Maurer-Cartan equation** for the $A_\infty$-algebra of $L$. A solution, known as a **bounding [cochain](@entry_id:275805)**, deforms the differential of the algebra and is necessary to define a valid object in the Fukaya category. The critical values of $W$ are then key invariants . On the B-side, the [superpotential](@entry_id:149670) $W$ defines a new category, either the category of **matrix factorizations** of $W$ or a singularity category. The extended HMS conjecture then posits an equivalence between the Fukaya category of $X$ and one of these categories associated to $(Y,W)$ . This generalization significantly expands the scope and power of [mirror symmetry](@entry_id:158730).
