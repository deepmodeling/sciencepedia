## Introduction
The study of systems with high degrees of symmetry often reveals profound underlying structures where complex geometric properties are mirrored in simpler, discrete objects. In the realm of symplectic geometry, this principle finds its most elegant expression in the theory of toric manifolds—systems endowed with a maximal torus action. While these manifolds are central to fields ranging from algebraic geometry to [mathematical physics](@entry_id:265403), their abstract nature can pose significant challenges. This article addresses the fundamental classification problem for these spaces, exploring how the Delzant theorem provides a complete and computable dictionary between geometry and [combinatorics](@entry_id:144343).

The reader will embark on a structured journey through this powerful theory. The first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, lays the theoretical groundwork, starting from the foundational concept of a Hamiltonian action and building up to the statement and proof of the Delzant theorem. The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, demonstrates the theorem's utility, showing how the 'toric dictionary' translates difficult problems in topology, analysis, and Kähler geometry into tractable computations on convex [polytopes](@entry_id:635589). Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section offers a set of targeted problems designed to solidify the key theoretical and computational aspects of the correspondence.

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter delineates the core principles and mechanisms that govern the structure of [symplectic toric manifolds](@entry_id:1132762). We begin by establishing the foundational concept of a Hamiltonian [group action](@entry_id:143336), which provides the essential link between the symmetries of a system and its conserved quantities. We then specialize this framework to the case of torus actions, introducing the algebraic and geometric structures that culminate in the Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg convexity theorem. This sets the stage for the central result of this topic: the Delzant theorem, a profound classification that establishes a [one-to-one correspondence](@entry_id:143935) between the geometry of toric manifolds and the [combinatorics](@entry_id:144343) of a special class of convex polytopes. We will dissect the mechanisms of this correspondence—the Delzant construction and the uniqueness proof—and conclude by exploring its generalization to the [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) setting.

### From Symplectic to Hamiltonian Actions

The study of Hamiltonian mechanics is fundamentally rooted in the geometry of symplectic manifolds. A **symplectic manifold** is a pair $(M, \omega)$, where $M$ is a smooth, even-dimensional manifold and $\omega$ is a differential $2$-form that is both **closed** ($d\omega = 0$) and **non-degenerate**. The non-degeneracy condition means that for any non-zero [tangent vector](@entry_id:264836) $v \in T_pM$ at a point $p \in M$, the $1$-form $\iota_v \omega_p$ is non-zero. This property ensures that the map $v \mapsto \iota_v \omega_p$ is an [isomorphism](@entry_id:137127) from the tangent space $T_pM$ to its dual, the [cotangent space](@entry_id:270516) $T_p^*M$. A direct consequence of non-degeneracy is that any symplectic manifold must be of even dimension .

When a Lie group $G$ acts on a manifold $M$, this action provides a notion of symmetry. Each element $\xi$ of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$ generates a flow on $M$, whose [infinitesimal generator](@entry_id:270424) is a vector field on $M$ called the **fundamental vector field**, denoted $\xi_M$. The action is said to be **symplectic** if it preserves the symplectic form, i.e., if for every $g \in G$, the induced [diffeomorphism](@entry_id:147249) $\phi_g: M \to M$ satisfies $\phi_g^* \omega = \omega$. For a connected Lie group $G$, this global condition is equivalent to the infinitesimal condition that the Lie derivative of $\omega$ with respect to every fundamental vector field vanishes: $\mathcal{L}_{\xi_M} \omega = 0$ for all $\xi \in \mathfrak{g}$ . Using Cartan's magic formula, $\mathcal{L}_{\xi_M} \omega = d(\iota_{\xi_M} \omega) + \iota_{\xi_M}(d\omega)$, and the fact that $\omega$ is closed ($d\omega=0$), the condition for a symplectic action simplifies to $d(\iota_{\xi_M} \omega) = 0$. This means that for every $\xi \in \mathfrak{g}$, the $1$-form $\iota_{\xi_M} \omega$ is closed.

A **Hamiltonian action** represents a significant strengthening of this condition. While a symplectic action guarantees that each $1$-form $\iota_{\xi_M} \omega$ is closed, a Hamiltonian action requires that these forms are also exact in a globally structured and linear way. Specifically, an action is Hamiltonian if there exists a [smooth map](@entry_id:160364) $\mu: M \to \mathfrak{g}^*$, called the **[moment map](@entry_id:157938)**, where $\mathfrak{g}^*$ is the dual of the Lie algebra. This map must satisfy the fundamental equation:
$$d\langle \mu, \xi \rangle = \iota_{\xi_M} \omega$$
for every $\xi \in \mathfrak{g}$ . Here, $\langle \mu, \xi \rangle$ denotes the function on $M$ obtained by pairing the $\mathfrak{g}^*$-valued map $\mu$ with the constant element $\xi \in \mathfrak{g}$. The function $H_\xi = \langle \mu, \xi \rangle$ is the Hamiltonian function associated with the symmetry generated by $\xi$. The existence of such a map $\mu$ imposes a strong constraint, as it requires the existence of a family of Hamiltonian functions $\{H_\xi\}$ that depends linearly on $\xi$. The obstructions to a symplectic action being Hamiltonian are cohomological in nature and are not always trivial.

For [non-abelian groups](@entry_id:145211), the [moment map](@entry_id:157938) is further required to be **equivariant** with respect to the coadjoint action of $G$ on $\mathfrak{g}^*$. However, when the group is abelian, such as a torus, the [coadjoint action](@entry_id:170681) is trivial, and [equivariance](@entry_id:636671) simplifies to the condition that the [moment map](@entry_id:157938) must be invariant under the [group action](@entry_id:143336).

### The Algebraic Structure of Torus Actions

The theory of moment [polytopes](@entry_id:635589) finds its richest expression in the context of actions by an $n$-dimensional torus $T^n = (S^1)^n$. The algebraic structure of the torus and its Lie algebra is central to understanding the integrality conditions that define Delzant polytopes. The Lie algebra of $T^n$, denoted $\mathfrak{t}$, can be identified with $\mathbb{R}^n$. Under a standard convention, the exponential map $\exp: \mathfrak{t} \to T^n$ is given by $\vec{\theta} \mapsto (e^{2\pi i \theta_1}, \dots, e^{2\pi i \theta_n})$. The kernel of this map is a discrete subgroup of $\mathfrak{t}$ known as the **integral lattice**, $\mathbb{Z}_T = \ker(\exp)$. With this normalization, $\mathbb{Z}_T$ is precisely the standard integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ .

Associated with the integral lattice is its dual. The **[dual lattice](@entry_id:150046)**, denoted $\mathbb{Z}_T^*$, is a lattice in the [dual space](@entry_id:146945) $\mathfrak{t}^*$ defined as:
$$ \mathbb{Z}_T^* = \{ \ell \in \mathfrak{t}^* \mid \langle \ell, v \rangle \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ for all } v \in \mathbb{Z}_T \} $$
This [dual lattice](@entry_id:150046) has a direct representation-theoretic interpretation. Group homomorphisms from the torus to the circle, $\chi: T^n \to S^1$, are called **characters**. Each character is specified by an integer vector $m \in \mathbb{Z}^n$. The differential of a character at the identity, after appropriate normalization, can be identified with an element of $\mathfrak{t}^*$. The set of all such elements, as one ranges over all possible characters, is precisely the [dual lattice](@entry_id:150046) $\mathbb{Z}_T^*$ . These lattices, $\mathbb{Z}_T$ and $\mathbb{Z}_T^*$, provide the fundamental notion of "integrality" for geometric data associated with torus actions, such as the normal vectors and edge directions of moment [polytopes](@entry_id:635589).

### The Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg Convexity Theorem

A foundational result concerning the global structure of Hamiltonian actions is the **Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg convexity theorem**. For a Hamiltonian action of a compact connected Lie group $G$ on a compact connected symplectic manifold $(M, \omega)$, the theorem states that the image of the moment map, $\mu(M) \subset \mathfrak{g}^*$, is a convex polytope. This [polytope](@entry_id:635803) is precisely the convex hull of the image of the points fixed by a maximal torus of $G$.

In the special case where the acting group is an $n$-torus $T^n$ itself, the theorem simplifies beautifully: the image $\mu(M)$ is the [convex hull](@entry_id:262864) of the images of the $T^n$-fixed points, $\mu(M) = \operatorname{conv}(\mu(M^{T^n}))$ . The vertices of this [convex polytope](@entry_id:1123046) are the images of the [connected components](@entry_id:141881) of the fixed-point set $M^{T^n}$.

The proof of this remarkable theorem relies on a local-to-global argument. The local picture is provided by the **Marle-Guillemin-Sternberg local normal form theorem**, which gives a canonical model for a Hamiltonian action in a neighborhood of any point . For a fixed point $p \in M$, the isotropy group is the entire torus $T^n$. The [tangent space](@entry_id:141028) $T_pM$ carries a linear action of $T^n$, which decomposes it into a [direct sum](@entry_id:156782) of $n$ complex one-dimensional weight spaces, $T_pM \cong \bigoplus_{j=1}^n \mathbb{C}_{\alpha_j}$, where the **weights** $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$ are elements of the [dual lattice](@entry_id:150046) $\mathbb{Z}_T^*$. The local [normal form](@entry_id:161181) theorem asserts that there exist local $T^n$-equivariant coordinates around $p$ such that the moment map takes the form:
$$ \mu(z) = \mu(p) + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{j=1}^n |z_j|^2 \alpha_j $$
This equation is of paramount importance. It reveals that the image of a small neighborhood of the fixed point $p$ is a conical region in $\mathfrak{t}^*$, based at the vertex $v = \mu(p)$ and spanned by the weight vectors $\{\alpha_j\}$ . This implies that the edges of the [moment polytope](@entry_id:1128124) emanating from the vertex $v$ must be aligned with the directions of the [isotropy](@entry_id:159159) weights at the corresponding fixed point $p$. This provides the crucial dictionary between the local geometry of the manifold (the weights) and the local [combinatorics](@entry_id:144343) of the [polytope](@entry_id:635803) (the edge vectors).

### The Delzant Theorem: A Classification

The principles discussed thus far culminate in the Delzant theorem, which provides a complete classification of a special class of manifolds. A **compact connected [symplectic toric manifold](@entry_id:1132761)** is a quadruple $(M^{2n}, \omega, T^n, \mu)$ where $(M, \omega)$ is a compact connected symplectic manifold of dimension $2n$, and $T^n$ is an $n$-torus that acts effectively and Hamiltonianly upon it . The condition $\dim M = 2\dim T$ is the hallmark of a toric system.

The Delzant theorem establishes a correspondence between these geometric objects and a class of combinatorial objects known as **Delzant [polytopes](@entry_id:635589)**. A convex polytope $\Delta \subset \mathfrak{t}^* \cong \mathbb{R}^n$ is a Delzant [polytope](@entry_id:635803) if it satisfies three conditions :
1.  **Simple**: It is a simple polytope, meaning exactly $n$ edges (and $n$ facets) meet at each vertex.
2.  **Rational**: The inward-pointing [normal vector](@entry_id:264185) to each facet, when chosen to be primitive, must be an element of the integral lattice $\mathbb{Z}_T$.
3.  **Smooth (or Unimodular)**: At each vertex, the $n$ primitive edge direction vectors $\{u_1, \dots, u_n\}$, which are elements of the [dual lattice](@entry_id:150046) $\mathbb{Z}_T^*$, must form a $\mathbb{Z}$-basis for $\mathbb{Z}_T^*$. This is equivalent to stating that the [integer matrix](@entry_id:151642) formed by these vectors has determinant $\pm 1$.

The smoothness condition is particularly critical. It ensures that the manifold being described is genuinely smooth and not a more general object known as an [orbifold](@entry_id:159587). From the geometric side, this condition corresponds to the requirement that at each fixed point $p$, the isotropy weights $\{\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n\}$ form a $\mathbb{Z}$-basis of the [weight lattice](@entry_id:195778) $\mathbb{Z}_T^*$ . The dictionary between weights and edge vectors ($\alpha_j = u_j$) thus translates the smoothness condition on the manifold directly into a combinatorial condition on the [polytope](@entry_id:635803).

With these definitions, the **Delzant Theorem** can be stated as follows :

> There is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of compact connected [symplectic toric manifolds](@entry_id:1132762) $(M, \omega, T, \mu)$, considered up to $T$-equivariant symplectomorphism, and the set of Delzant [polytopes](@entry_id:635589) $\Delta \subset \mathfrak{t}^*$, considered up to translation.

This theorem asserts that every such manifold gives rise to a unique Delzant [polytope](@entry_id:635803) (up to translation), and conversely, every Delzant polytope can be used to construct a unique such manifold (up to equivalence) .

### Mechanisms of the Correspondence

The Delzant theorem's [bijection](@entry_id:138092) consists of two distinct procedures: analysis (from manifold to [polytope](@entry_id:635803)) and synthesis (from [polytope](@entry_id:635803) to manifold), along with a proof of uniqueness.

#### Manifold to Polytope: Analysis
This direction is a consequence of the theorems already discussed. Given a compact connected [symplectic toric manifold](@entry_id:1132761), the Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg theorem ensures the moment map image $\mu(M)$ is a convex polytope. The effectiveness of the $T^n$ action on a $2n$-dimensional manifold implies the polytope is simple. The underlying integral structure of the torus action ensures the polytope is rational. Finally, the smoothness of the manifold $M$ imposes the crucial unimodularity condition on the edge vectors at each vertex, making $\mu(M)$ a Delzant polytope  .

#### Polytope to Manifold: The Delzant Construction
The converse, constructing a manifold from a [polytope](@entry_id:635803), is known as the **Delzant construction**. It is an elegant application of [symplectic reduction](@entry_id:170200) . Let $\Delta \subset \mathfrak{t}^* \cong \mathbb{R}^n$ be a Delzant [polytope](@entry_id:635803) with $m$ facets, defined by inequalities $\langle x, v_i \rangle \ge \lambda_i$ for $i=1, \dots, m$, where $v_i \in \mathbb{Z}_T$ are primitive inward normals.

1.  One begins with the standard Hamiltonian action of the $m$-torus $T^m$ on $(\mathbb{C}^m, \omega_{\text{std}})$. The moment map for this action is $\mu_{\mathbb{C}^m}(z) = (\frac{1}{2}|z_1|^2, \dots, \frac{1}{2}|z_m|^2)$.

2.  A linear map $\pi: \mathfrak{t}^m \to \mathfrak{t}$ is defined by sending the $i$-th [basis vector](@entry_id:199546) of $\mathbb{R}^m$ to the $i$-th [normal vector](@entry_id:264185) $v_i \in \mathbb{Z}_T$. This induces a surjective torus homomorphism $\Pi: T^m \to T^n$. Let $K = \ker(\Pi)$ be the $(m-n)$-dimensional subtorus of $T^m$ that we will reduce by.

3.  The manifold $M_\Delta$ is constructed as the [symplectic quotient](@entry_id:1132757) of $\mathbb{C}^m$ by the action of the subtorus $K$. The reduction is performed on the level set of a shifted moment map, incorporating the constants $\lambda_i$. Specifically, $M_\Delta = \mu_K^{-1}(-\vec{\lambda}) / K$, where $\mu_K$ is the [moment map](@entry_id:157938) for the $K$-action and $\vec{\lambda}$ is the vector of constants.

The resulting space $M_\Delta$ is a compact, connected $2n$-dimensional symplectic manifold. The residual action of $T^n \cong T^m/K$ on $M_\Delta$ is effective and Hamiltonian, and by construction, the image of its [moment map](@entry_id:157938) is precisely the original Delzant polytope $\Delta$. The Delzant conditions on the [polytope](@entry_id:635803) are exactly what is needed to ensure that this quotient is a [smooth manifold](@entry_id:156564).

#### Uniqueness
The final piece of the puzzle is to show that two toric manifolds with the same [moment polytope](@entry_id:1128124) are indeed equivalent. This is established using an equivariant version of **Moser's path method** . Suppose $(M_0, \omega_0)$ and $(M_1, \omega_1)$ have moment maps whose images are translates of the same Delzant polytope $\Delta$. One can construct a $T$-equivariant diffeomorphism $\Phi: M_0 \to M_1$ that identifies the manifolds and aligns their moment maps. This $\Phi$ is generally not a symplectomorphism, meaning $\omega_1 \neq \Phi_*\omega_0$.

However, it can be shown that the difference of these two [symplectic forms](@entry_id:165896) on $M_1$ is an exact $2$-form, $\omega_1 - \Phi_*\omega_0 = d\alpha$. The crucial insight is that the $1$-form $\alpha$ can be chosen to be **$T$-basic**, meaning it is both $T$-invariant ($\mathcal{L}_{\xi_M}\alpha = 0$) and horizontal ($\iota_{\xi_M}\alpha = 0$). Applying Moser's method with this special primitive generates a time-dependent flow that corrects the initial [diffeomorphism](@entry_id:147249) $\Phi$. The properties of the $T$-basic form $\alpha$ ensure that this correcting flow is itself $T$-equivariant and preserves the [moment map](@entry_id:157938). The composition of the original [diffeomorphism](@entry_id:147249) with the correcting flow yields the desired $T$-equivariant [symplectomorphism](@entry_id:1132764), establishing uniqueness.

### Generalization to Symplectic Toric Orbifolds

The elegant classification provided by Delzant's theorem can be extended from [smooth manifolds](@entry_id:160799) to **symplectic toric orbifolds**. This generalization, developed by Lerman and Tolman, arises from relaxing the smoothness condition on the [polytope](@entry_id:635803) .

The combinatorial object in this more general setting is a **labeled rational simple polytope**. If the smoothness condition is relaxed, the resulting space may have singularities. Specifically, if at a vertex of the [polytope](@entry_id:635803), the primitive inward normals $\{u_1, \dots, u_n\}$ of the incident facets do not form a $\mathbb{Z}$-basis of the lattice $\mathbb{Z}_T$, the corresponding fixed point is an **[orbifold](@entry_id:159587) singularity**. The local isotropy group at that point is finite, and its order is given by the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix formed by these normal vectors.

In the full classification by Lerman and Tolman, each facet $F$ of the polytope $\Delta$ is assigned a positive integer label, $m_F \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$. This label has a precise geometric meaning: it is the order of the generic [stabilizer subgroup](@entry_id:137216) for points on the [preimage](@entry_id:150899) of the facet, $\mu^{-1}(\text{int}(F))$. The action is free over the interior of the [polytope](@entry_id:635803), but along these [codimension](@entry_id:273141)-one sub-orbifolds, there is finite cyclic isotropy of order $m_F$ .

The full classification theorem states that there is a [bijection](@entry_id:138092) between compact connected symplectic toric orbifolds (up to equivariant symplectomorphism) and these labeled [polytopes](@entry_id:635589) (up to integral affine equivalence). This provides a beautiful generalization of the smooth case. Indeed, a smooth manifold corresponds to an action with trivial stabilizers everywhere, which means all labels must be $m_F=1$ and the polytope must satisfy the smoothness condition at every vertex .
