            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the well-established theory of symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian group actions. The setup is self-contained, objective, and well-posed, admitting a unique and meaningful solution. The task is to compute the Duistermaat–Heckman density for a standard circle action on the $2$-sphere, which is a canonical example in this field.\n\nThe Duistermaat–Heckman (DH) density, denoted $\\rho(\\mu)$, describes the pushforward of the Liouville measure (in this case, the symplectic form $\\omega$) onto the dual of the Lie algebra of the acting group (here, $\\mathbb{R}$). The fundamental definition of the pushforward measure is given by the relation\n$$\n\\int_{S^2} (f \\circ \\Phi) \\, \\omega = \\int_{\\text{Im}(\\Phi)} f(\\mu) \\, \\rho(\\mu) \\, d\\mu\n$$\nwhich must hold for any integrable test function $f$ on the image of the moment map, $\\text{Im}(\\Phi)$. We will solve the problem by first determining the explicit form of the moment map $\\Phi$ and its image, and then evaluating the integral on the left to deduce the function $\\rho(\\mu)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the moment map $\\Phi$. It is defined, up to an additive constant, by the equation $d\\Phi = \\iota_X \\omega$. The given data are:\n- The symplectic manifold is the $2$-sphere $S^2$ of radius $R$, with symplectic form $\\omega = R^2 \\sin\\theta\\, d\\theta\\wedge d\\phi$. The coordinates are spherical coordinates $(\\theta, \\phi)$, with $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$ being the polar angle and $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ being the azimuthal angle.\n- The acting group is $S^1$, and the fundamental vector field corresponding to the action is $X = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}$.\n\nWe compute the interior product $\\iota_X \\omega$:\n$$\n\\iota_X \\omega = \\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}} (R^2 \\sin\\theta\\, d\\theta\\wedge d\\phi)\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\iota_V(\\alpha \\wedge \\beta) = (\\iota_V \\alpha)\\beta - \\alpha(\\iota_V \\beta)$ for a vector field $V$ and $1$-forms $\\alpha, \\beta$:\n$$\n\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}} (R^2 \\sin\\theta\\, d\\theta\\wedge d\\phi) = R^2 \\sin\\theta \\left( (\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}} d\\theta) d\\phi - d\\theta (\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}} d\\phi) \\right)\n$$\nSince $\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}} d\\theta = d\\theta(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}) = 0$ and $\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}} d\\phi = d\\phi(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}) = 1$, we have:\n$$\n\\iota_X \\omega = R^2 \\sin\\theta (0 \\cdot d\\phi - d\\theta \\cdot 1) = -R^2 \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta\n$$\nNow, we solve for $\\Phi$ by integrating $d\\Phi = -R^2 \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta$.\n$$\n\\Phi(\\theta, \\phi) = \\int (-R^2 \\sin\\theta) \\, d\\theta = R^2 \\cos\\theta + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. The moment map is a function of $\\theta$ only, as it must be constant along the orbits of the $S^1$ action (curves of constant $\\theta$).\n\nNext, we use the normalization condition that the image of $\\Phi$ is the closed interval $[0, L]$. The domain of $\\theta$ is $[0, \\pi]$.\nThe maximum value of $\\Phi$ occurs at $\\theta=0$ (North Pole): $\\Phi_{\\max} = R^2 \\cos(0) + C = R^2 + C$.\nThe minimum value of $\\Phi$ occurs at $\\theta=\\pi$ (South Pole): $\\Phi_{\\min} = R^2 \\cos(\\pi) + C = -R^2 + C$.\nThe image of $\\Phi$ is the interval $[\\Phi_{\\min}, \\Phi_{\\max}] = [-R^2+C, R^2+C]$.\nEquating this with the specified interval $[0, L]$:\n- $\\Phi_{\\min} = -R^2 + C = 0 \\implies C = R^2$.\n- $\\Phi_{\\max} = R^2 + C = L \\implies L = R^2 + R^2 = 2R^2$.\n\nThus, the moment map is given by $\\Phi(\\theta) = R^2 \\cos\\theta + R^2 = R^2(1+\\cos\\theta)$, and its image is the interval $[0, 2R^2]$.\n\nNow we compute the DH density $\\rho(\\mu)$. We start with the left-hand side of the defining integral relation:\n$$\n\\int_{S^2} (f \\circ \\Phi) \\, \\omega = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi f(\\Phi(\\theta)) \\, (R^2 \\sin\\theta) \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi\n$$\nSince the integrand does not depend on $\\phi$, the integration over $\\phi$ yields a factor of $2\\pi$:\n$$\n\\int_{S^2} (f \\circ \\Phi) \\, \\omega = 2\\pi \\int_0^\\pi f(R^2(1+\\cos\\theta)) R^2 \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta\n$$\nWe perform a change of variable in the remaining integral from $\\theta$ to $\\mu$. Let $\\mu = \\Phi(\\theta) = R^2(1+\\cos\\theta)$. The differential is $d\\mu = -R^2 \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta$.\nWe also change the limits of integration:\n- As $\\theta \\to 0$, $\\mu \\to R^2(1+\\cos(0)) = 2R^2 = L$.\n- As $\\theta \\to \\pi$, $\\mu \\to R^2(1+\\cos(\\pi)) = 0$.\nSubstituting into the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{S^2} (f \\circ \\Phi) \\, \\omega = 2\\pi \\int_{\\theta=\\pi}^{\\theta=0} f(R^2(1+\\cos\\theta)) (R^2 \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta) = 2\\pi \\int_{\\mu=0}^{\\mu=L} f(\\mu) (-d\\mu)\n$$\nThe integral expression is better written by absorbing the minus sign to flip the integration limits:\n$$\n\\int_{S^2} (f \\circ \\Phi) \\, \\omega = 2\\pi \\int_0^L f(\\mu) \\, d\\mu\n$$\nComparing this result with the definition of the DH density,\n$$\n\\int_0^L \\rho(\\mu) f(\\mu) \\, d\\mu = 2\\pi \\int_0^L f(\\mu) \\, d\\mu\n$$\nwe see that for this equality to hold for any arbitrary integrable function $f$, the integrands must be equal almost everywhere. Therefore, the DH density is:\n$$\n\\rho(\\mu) = 2\\pi\n$$\nfor $\\mu \\in [0, L] = [0, 2R^2]$. This verifies that the density $\\rho(\\mu)$ is constant on the interval $[0, L]$.\n\nAs a consistency check, the integral of the DH density over its support should equal the total symplectic volume of the manifold.\nTotal volume $\\text{Vol}(S^2) = \\int_{S^2} \\omega = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi R^2 \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi = 2\\pi R^2 [-\\cos\\theta]_0^\\pi = 2\\pi R^2 (1 - (-1)) = 4\\pi R^2$.\nIntegral of the density $\\int_0^L \\rho(\\mu) \\, d\\mu = \\int_0^{2R^2} 2\\pi \\, d\\mu = 2\\pi [ \\mu ]_0^{2R^2} = 2\\pi (2R^2) = 4\\pi R^2$.\nThe values match, confirming the correctness of our result. The constant value of the density is $2\\pi$.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the facet presentation of a transformed Delzant polytope $\\Delta$, which is obtained by applying a linear transformation $U \\in \\operatorname{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ to an initial Delzant triangle $\\Delta_0$. The facet presentation consists of a set of inequalities of the form $\\langle y, \\nu'_i \\rangle \\geq \\lambda'_i$, where the $\\nu'_i$ are primitive inward normal vectors in the integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}_T$ and the $\\lambda'_i$ are real support numbers.\n\nFirst, we address the uniqueness of the facet presentation. A convex polytope in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is uniquely defined as the intersection of a minimal set of closed half-spaces. Each such half-space corresponds to a facet of the polytope. A half-space is defined by an inequality $\\langle y, \\nu' \\rangle \\geq \\lambda'$. The corresponding hyperplane $\\langle y, \\nu' \\rangle = \\lambda'$ contains the facet. The normal vector $\\nu'$ to this hyperplane is unique up to a non-zero scalar multiple. The direction of the inequality, which specifies that the polytope lies on one side of the hyperplane, determines the orientation of the normal vector. To be an \"inward\" normal, the vector must point into the interior of the polytope. This condition fixes the normal vector's direction, leaving it unique only up to a positive scalar multiple. When we require the normal vector to be an element of the integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}_T$ (identified with $\\mathbb{Z}^n$) and to be *primitive* (i.e., its integer components are coprime), this positive scaling factor is uniquely fixed. Consequently, for each facet of the polytope, there is a unique primitive inward normal vector $\\nu'_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_T$. Once $\\nu'_i$ is uniquely determined, the support number $\\lambda'_i$ is also uniquely determined by the position of the facet.\n\nThe initial polytope $\\Delta_0 \\subset \\mathfrak{t}^* \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$ is defined by the inequalities $\\langle x, \\nu_i \\rangle \\geq \\lambda_i$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, where:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\nu_1 = (1, 0) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$, $\\lambda_1 = 0$\n    \\item $\\nu_2 = (0, 1) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$, $\\lambda_2 = 0$\n    \\item $\\nu_3 = (-1, -1) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$, $\\lambda_3 = -1$\n\\end{itemize}\nThese vectors $\\nu_i$ are primitive in the integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n\nThe transformed polytope is $\\Delta = U\\Delta_0 = \\{ y \\in \\mathfrak{t}^* \\mid y = Ux \\text{ for some } x \\in \\Delta_0 \\}$.\nA point $y$ is in $\\Delta$ if and only if the point $x = U^{-1}y$ is in $\\Delta_0$. This means $x=U^{-1}y$ must satisfy the inequalities defining $\\Delta_0$:\n$$ \\langle U^{-1}y, \\nu_i \\rangle \\geq \\lambda_i \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $$\nThe duality pairing $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle: \\mathfrak{t}^* \\times \\mathfrak{t} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ relates the action of a linear operator on $\\mathfrak{t}^*$ to its transpose operator on $\\mathfrak{t}$. Specifically, for any linear operator $A: \\mathfrak{t}^* \\to \\mathfrak{t}^*$, its transpose $A^T: \\mathfrak{t} \\to \\mathfrak{t}$ is defined by the relation $\\langle Ay, v \\rangle = \\langle y, A^T v \\rangle$ for all $y \\in \\mathfrak{t}^*$ and $v \\in \\mathfrak{t}$. Applying this to our inequality with $A = U^{-1}$, we get:\n$$ \\langle y, (U^{-1})^T \\nu_i \\rangle \\geq \\lambda_i $$\nThis gives the facet presentation for the new polytope $\\Delta$. The new inward normal vectors are $\\nu'_i = (U^{-1})^T \\nu_i$ and the new support numbers are $\\lambda'_i = \\lambda_i$.\n\nThe matrix $U$ is given as $U = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Since $\\det(U) = 1$, $U$ is in $\\operatorname{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Its inverse is $U^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, which is also in $\\operatorname{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The transpose of the inverse is:\n$$ (U^{-1})^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSince $(U^{-1})^T \\in \\operatorname{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, it is an automorphism of the integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. A property of such automorphisms is that they map primitive vectors to primitive vectors.

This vertex, let's call it $v_{13}$, is the point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ that simultaneously satisfies the equality conditions for the facets corresponding to $u_1$ and $u_3$. These conditions are:\n$$\n\\langle x, u_1 \\rangle = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\langle x, u_3 \\rangle = -1\n$$\nSubstituting the given vectors, we obtain a system of linear equations for the coordinates $(x_1, x_2)$ of the vertex:\n$$\nx_1 = 0\n$$\n$$\n-x_1 - 3x_2 = -1\n$$\nSubstituting $x_1=0$ into the second equation yields $-3x_2 = -1$, which gives $x_2 = \\frac{1}{3}$. Thus, the vertex is $v_{13} = (0, \\frac{1}{3})$.\n\nThe local structure of a toric variety or orbifold at a fixed point is determined by the geometry of the moment polytope vertex corresponding to that fixed point. The fixed points of the $T^2$ action are the preimages under the moment map $\\mu$ of the vertices of the polytope $\\Delta$.\n\nAccording to the Delzant theorem for smooth toric manifolds, the space is locally diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{C}^2$ around a fixed point if and only if the primitive inward-pointing normals of the $2$ facets meeting at the corresponding vertex form a $\\mathbb{Z}$-basis for the integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. This is equivalent to the condition that the determinant of the matrix formed by these normal vectors is $\\pm 1$.\n\nThis criterion generalizes to toric orbifolds. If the set of primitive inward-pointing normals $\\{u_i, u_j\\}$ at a vertex is a basis for $\\mathbb{R}^2$ but not for $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, the corresponding fixed point is an orbifold singularity. The local structure is modeled on $\\mathbb{C}^2/G_v$, where $G_v$ is a finite group. For a $T^2$ action on a $4$-manifold, this group is cyclic. The order of this group, $|G_v|$, is given by the absolute value of the determinant of the $2 \\times 2$ matrix whose columns (or rows) are the normal vectors $u_i$ and $u_j$.\n\nFor the vertex $v_{13}$, the incident facet normals are $u_1=(1,0)$ and $u_3=(-1,-3)$. We form the matrix $U$ with these vectors as columns:\n$$\nU = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ 0 & -3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n$$\n\\det(U) = (1)(-3) - (-1)(0) = -3\n$$\nThe order of the local finite cyclic orbifold group $G_{v_{13}}$ is the absolute value of this determinant:\n$$\n|G_{v_{13}}| = |\\det(U)| = |-3| = 3\n$$\nThus, from first principles, the order of the local group is $3$.\n\nNext, we explain the connection to weighted projective spaces and the local quotient structure. The polytope $\\Delta$ is the triangle in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(0, \\frac{1}{3})$. The third side of this triangle is the line connecting $(1,0)$ and $(0, \\frac{1}{3})$, which has the equation $x_1 + 3x_2 = 1$. This corresponds to the inequality $\\langle x, u_3 \\rangle \\ge -1$, i.e., $-x_1-3x_2 \\ge -1$. This polytope is a standard representation of the moment polytope for the weighted projective space $\\mathbb{P}(1,3,1)$, which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{P}(1,1,3)$ by relabeling of homogeneous coordinates.\n\nThe local structure of a toric orbifold at a fixed point $p_v$ (corresponding to a vertex $v$) is described by a local model $\\mathbb{C}^2 / G_v$. This arises from the principles of symplectic reduction. The Lie algebra of the torus is $\\mathfrak{t} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$, and its integer lattice is $\\ker(\\exp: \\mathfrak{t} \\to T^2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2$. The local $T^2$ action on the tangent space $T_{p_v}M \\cong \\mathbb{C}^2$ is linear and, in a suitable complex basis, diagonal. The weights of this action are vectors in the dual lattice $(\\mathbb{Z}^2)^* \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n\nIn a smooth setting (a Delzant manifold), the primitive normals $\\{ u_i, u_j \\}$ at a vertex form a $\\mathbb{Z}$-basis for this lattice, and the local model naturally is $\\mathbb{C}^2$. In an orbifold setting, the lattice $\\Lambda_v = \\text{span}_{\\mathbb{Z}}\\{u_1, u_3\\}$ generated by the normals is a proper sublattice of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. The local group $G_v$ is precisely the quotient group $G_v \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2 / \\Lambda_v$. The order of this finite abelian group is the index of the sublattice $\\Lambda_v$ in $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, which is given by the volume of the fundamental parallelogram of $\\Lambda_v$. This volume is $|\\det(U)|$. In our case, the order is $3$, and the group is isomorphic to the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n\nThe action of $G_v$ on $\\mathbb{C}^2$ is the restriction of the linearized $T^2$ action. Since the $T^2$ action is diagonal in an appropriate coordinate system, the action of its finite subgroup $G_v < T^2$ is also diagonal. The group $G_v$ is generated by an element that corresponds to a non-trivial element of $\\mathbb{Z}^2/\\Lambda_v$. The action is of the form $g \\cdot (z_1, z_2) = (\\rho_1(g)z_1, \\rho_2(g)z_2)$, where $\\rho_1, \\rho_2$ are characters determined by the embedding of $G_v$ in $T^2$. This explains why the local model is a cyclic quotient of $\\mathbb{C}^2$ by a diagonal action.",
