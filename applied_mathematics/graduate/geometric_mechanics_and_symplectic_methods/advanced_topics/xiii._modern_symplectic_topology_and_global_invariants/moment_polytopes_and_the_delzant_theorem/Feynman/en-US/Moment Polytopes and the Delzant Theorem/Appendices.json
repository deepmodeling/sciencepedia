            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the well-established theory of symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian group actions. The setup is self-contained, objective, and well-posed, admitting a unique and meaningful solution. The task is to compute the Duistermaat–Heckman density for a standard circle action on the $2$-sphere, which is a canonical example in this field.\n\nThe Duistermaat–Heckman (DH) density, denoted $\\rho(\\mu)$, describes the pushforward of the Liouville measure (in this case, the symplectic form $\\omega$) onto the dual of the Lie algebra of the acting group (here, $\\mathbb{R}$). The fundamental definition of the pushforward measure is given by the relation\n$$\n\\int_{S^2} (f \\circ \\Phi) \\, \\omega = \\int_{\\text{Im}(\\Phi)} f(\\mu) \\, \\rho(\\mu) \\, d\\mu\n$$\nwhich must hold for any integrable test function $f$ on the image of the moment map, $\\text{Im}(\\Phi)$. We will solve the problem by first determining the explicit form of the moment map $\\Phi$ and its image, and then evaluating the integral on the left to deduce the function $\\rho(\\mu)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the moment map $\\Phi$. It is defined, up to an additive constant, by the equation $d\\Phi = \\iota_X \\omega$. The given data are:\n- The symplectic manifold is the $2$-sphere $S^2$ of radius $R$, with symplectic form $\\omega = R^2 \\sin\\theta\\, d\\theta\\wedge d\\phi$. The coordinates are spherical coordinates $(\\theta, \\phi)$, with $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$ being the polar angle and $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ being the azimuthal angle.\n- The acting group is $S^1$, and the fundamental vector field corresponding to the action is $X = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}$.\n\nWe compute the interior product $\\iota_X \\omega$:\n$$\n\\iota_X \\omega = \\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}} (R^2 \\sin\\theta\\, d\\theta\\wedge d\\phi)\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\iota_V(\\alpha \\wedge \\beta) = (\\iota_V \\alpha)\\beta - \\alpha(\\iota_V \\beta)$ for a vector field $V$ and $1$-forms $\\alpha, \\beta$:\n$$\n\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}} (R^2 \\sin\\theta\\, d\\theta\\wedge d\\phi) = R^2 \\sin\\theta \\left( (\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}} d\\theta) d\\phi - d\\theta (\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}} d\\phi) \\right)\n$$\nSince $\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}} d\\theta = d\\theta(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}) = 0$ and $\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}} d\\phi = d\\phi(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}) = 1$, we have:\n$$\n\\iota_X \\omega = R^2 \\sin\\theta (0 \\cdot d\\phi - d\\theta \\cdot 1) = -R^2 \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta\n$$\nNow, we solve for $\\Phi$ by integrating $d\\Phi = -R^2 \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta$.\n$$\n\\Phi(\\theta, \\phi) = \\int (-R^2 \\sin\\theta) \\, d\\theta = R^2 \\cos\\theta + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. The moment map is a function of $\\theta$ only, as it must be constant along the orbits of the $S^1$ action (curves of constant $\\theta$).\n\nNext, we use the normalization condition that the image of $\\Phi$ is the closed interval $[0, L]$. The domain of $\\theta$ is $[0, \\pi]$.\nThe maximum value of $\\Phi$ occurs at $\\theta=0$ (North Pole): $\\Phi_{\\max} = R^2 \\cos(0) + C = R^2 + C$.\nThe minimum value of $\\Phi$ occurs at $\\theta=\\pi$ (South Pole): $\\Phi_{\\min} = R^2 \\cos(\\pi) + C = -R^2 + C$.\nThe image of $\\Phi$ is the interval $[\\Phi_{\\min}, \\Phi_{\\max}] = [-R^2+C, R^2+C]$.\nEquating this with the specified interval $[0, L]$:\n- $\\Phi_{\\min} = -R^2 + C = 0 \\implies C = R^2$.\n- $\\Phi_{\\max} = R^2 + C = L \\implies L = R^2 + R^2 = 2R^2$.\n\nThus, the moment map is given by $\\Phi(\\theta) = R^2 \\cos\\theta + R^2 = R^2(1+\\cos\\theta)$, and its image is the interval $[0, 2R^2]$.\n\nNow we compute the DH density $\\rho(\\mu)$. We start with the left-hand side of the defining integral relation:\n$$\n\\int_{S^2} (f \\circ \\Phi) \\, \\omega = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi f(\\Phi(\\theta)) \\, (R^2 \\sin\\theta) \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi\n$$\nSince the integrand does not depend on $\\phi$, the integration over $\\phi$ yields a factor of $2\\pi$:\n$$\n\\int_{S^2} (f \\circ \\Phi) \\, \\omega = 2\\pi \\int_0^\\pi f(R^2(1+\\cos\\theta)) R^2 \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta\n$$\nWe perform a change of variable in the remaining integral from $\\theta$ to $\\mu$. Let $\\mu = \\Phi(\\theta) = R^2(1+\\cos\\theta)$. The differential is $d\\mu = -R^2 \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta$.\nWe also change the limits of integration:\n- As $\\theta \\to 0$, $\\mu \\to R^2(1+\\cos(0)) = 2R^2 = L$.\n- As $\\theta \\to \\pi$, $\\mu \\to R^2(1+\\cos(\\pi)) = 0$.\nSubstituting into the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{S^2} (f \\circ \\Phi) \\, \\omega = 2\\pi \\int_{\\theta=\\pi}^{\\theta=0} f(R^2(1+\\cos\\theta)) (R^2 \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta) = 2\\pi \\int_{\\mu=0}^{\\mu=L} f(\\mu) (-d\\mu)\n$$\nThe integral expression is better written by absorbing the minus sign to flip the integration limits:\n$$\n\\int_{S^2} (f \\circ \\Phi) \\, \\omega = 2\\pi \\int_0^L f(\\mu) \\, d\\mu\n$$\nComparing this result with the definition of the DH density,\n$$\n\\int_0^L \\rho(\\mu) f(\\mu) \\, d\\mu = 2\\pi \\int_0^L f(\\mu) \\, d\\mu\n$$\nwe see that for this equality to hold for any arbitrary integrable function $f$, the integrands must be equal almost everywhere. Therefore, the DH density is:\n$$\n\\rho(\\mu) = 2\\pi\n$$\nfor $\\mu \\in [0, L] = [0, 2R^2]$. This verifies that the density $\\rho(\\mu)$ is constant on the interval $[0, L]$.\n\nAs a consistency check, the integral of the DH density over its support should equal the total symplectic volume of the manifold.\nTotal volume $\\text{Vol}(S^2) = \\int_{S^2} \\omega = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi R^2 \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi = 2\\pi R^2 [-\\cos\\theta]_0^\\pi = 2\\pi R^2 (1 - (-1)) = 4\\pi R^2$.\nIntegral of the density $\\int_0^L \\rho(\\mu) \\, d\\mu = \\int_0^{2R^2} 2\\pi \\, d\\mu = 2\\pi [ \\mu ]_0^{2R^2} = 2\\pi (2R^2) = 4\\pi R^2$.\nThe values match, confirming the correctness of our result. The constant value of the density is $2\\pi$.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the correct characterization of the equivalence relation on Delzant polytopes, which corresponds to the $T$-equivariant symplectomorphism classification of symplectic toric manifolds. The transformation in question is an affine map $x \\mapsto Ax + b$ applied to a Delzant polytope $\\Delta \\subset \\mathfrak{t}^*$.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- A compact torus $T$ acts effectively and Hamiltonianly on a compact, connected symplectic manifold $(M^{2n}, \\omega)$.\n- The Lie algebra of $T$ is $\\mathfrak{t}$, its dual is $\\mathfrak{t}^*$.\n- A moment map $\\Phi : M \\to \\mathfrak{t}^*$ exists, satisfying $\\iota_{X_\\xi} \\omega = d\\langle \\Phi, \\xi \\rangle$ for $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{t}$.\n- The image $\\Delta = \\Phi(M)$ is a Delzant polytope.

It accurately presents core definitions and theorems from the field of symplectic geometry, specifically concerning Hamiltonian torus actions and the Delzant classification of toric manifolds. The concepts of moment maps, Delzant polytopes, weight lattices, and the role of torus automorphisms are all standard and correctly stated. The problem is well-posed, asking to identify the specific nature of the \"integral-affine equivalence\" mentioned in the Delzant theorem. It is objective, complete, and contains no contradictions or ambiguities. It poses a standard conceptual question in this area of mathematics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We will proceed to derive the nature of the allowed transformations and evaluate each option.\n\nThe overall equivalence relation is \"integral-affine equivalence\". An affine transformation is one of the form $x \\mapsto Ax + b$, combining a linear map $A$ and a translation $b$. We must determine the specific constraints on $A$ and $b$.\n\n**Analysis of the Translation part ($b$):**\nThe moment map $\\Phi$ is defined by the relation $\\iota_{X_\\xi} \\omega = d\\langle \\Phi, \\xi \\rangle$. Let us consider a translated map $\\Phi' = \\Phi + b$ for some constant vector $b \\in \\mathfrak{t}^*$. The new function $\\langle \\Phi', \\xi \\rangle$ is $\\langle \\Phi, \\xi \\rangle + \\langle b, \\xi \\rangle$. The exterior derivative is $d\\langle \\Phi', \\xi \\rangle = d\\langle \\Phi, \\xi \\rangle + d\\langle b, \\xi \\rangle$. Since $b$ and $\\xi$ are constant vectors, their pairing $\\langle b, \\xi \\rangle$ is a constant scalar, and its derivative is zero: $d\\langle b, \\xi \\rangle = 0$.\nThus, $d\\langle \\Phi', \\xi \\rangle = d\\langle \\Phi, \\xi \\rangle$. This means $\\Phi' = \\Phi + b$ is also a valid moment map for the same Hamiltonian action. The choice of moment map is arbitrary up to an additive constant.\nThe image of the new moment map is $\\Phi'(M) = \\Phi(M) + b = \\Delta + b$. This corresponds to a translation of the moment polytope by the vector $b$. Therefore, any translation $x \\mapsto x+b$ for $b \\in \\mathfrak{t}^*$ is part of the equivalence.\n\n**Analysis of the Linear part ($A$):**\nThe linear transformations $A$ arise from automorphisms of the torus $T$. An automorphism $\\rho: T \\to T$ of the $n$-torus induces a linear map on its Lie algebra, $d\\rho_e: \\mathfrak{t} \\to \\mathfrak{t}$, and a corresponding dual map on $\\mathfrak{t}^*$. Composing the original action with $\\rho$ yields a new effective Hamiltonian $T$-action, which is considered equivalent.\nThe crucial point is how this affects the weight lattice $\\mathbb{Z}_T^*$. The weight lattice $\\mathbb{Z}_T^*$ is the lattice of characters of $T$. An automorphism of $T$ must map this lattice of characters to itself. Consequently, the induced linear map on $\\mathfrak{t}^*$, let's call it $A$, must preserve the weight lattice: $A(\\mathbb{Z}_T^*) = \\mathbb{Z}_T^*$.\nIf we choose a basis of $\\mathfrak{t}^*$ in which the vectors of $\\mathbb{Z}_T^*$ are precisely the integer vectors $\\mathbb{Z}^n$, then the matrix representation of $A$ must map $\\mathbb{Z}^n$ to $\\mathbb{Z}^n$. Such a linear isomorphism is represented by a matrix with integer entries whose inverse also has integer entries. This is the definition of the general linear group over the integers, $\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe Delzant condition requires that at each vertex, the primitive inward-pointing facet normals $\\{u_1, \\dots, u_n\\}$ form a $\\mathbb{Z}$-basis for the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}_T^*$. If we apply a linear transformation $A$ to the polytope, the normals are transformed. Assuming an inner product on $\\mathfrak{t}^*$, a facet with normal $u_i$ is transformed to a facet with normal $(A^{-1})^T u_i$. For the Delzant condition to hold on the new polytope, the set $\\{(A^{-1})^T u_1, \\dots, (A^{-1})^T u_n\\}$ must also be a $\\mathbb{Z}$-basis of $\\mathbb{Z}_T^*$. This is true if and only if the map $(A^{-1})^T$ is an automorphism of the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}_T^*$. This is equivalent to the condition that $A$ itself is an automorphism of the lattice, which in a suitable basis means $A \\in \\operatorname{GL}(n, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nCombining these two analyses, the allowed transformations are of the form $x \\mapsto Ax + b$, where $b \\in \\mathfrak{t}^*$ is any vector, and $A$ is a linear map that preserves the integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}_T^*$, i.e., $A \\in \\operatorname{GL}(n, \\mathbb{Z})$ in a basis adapted to the lattice. This is precisely an integral-affine transformation.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options.\n\n**A. Any composition of a translation by $b$ and an arbitrary rotation in the Special Orthogonal (SO) group $\\operatorname{SO}(n)$ preserves the Delzant equivalence class, because rotations preserve angles and volumes and thus the polytope’s combinatorics.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. An arbitrary rotation $A \\in \\operatorname{SO}(n)$ does not, in general, preserve the integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}_T^*$. For instance, in dimension $n=2$, a rotation by $\\theta = \\pi/4$ maps the lattice vector $(1,0)^T$ to $(\\cos(\\pi/4), \\sin(\\pi/4))^T = (1/\\sqrt{2}, 1/\\sqrt{2})^T$, which is not in $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. While rotations preserve the shape (combinatorics, angles, volume) of the polytope, they do not preserve the crucial condition that the facet normals at vertices must form a basis of the *integer* lattice. Only a very small, finite number of rotations belong to $\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**B. A composition of a translation by $b$ and a linear map $A$ in the General Linear (GL) group $\\operatorname{GL}(n,\\mathbb{Z})$ preserves the Delzant equivalence class, because addition of $b$ does not change the Hamiltonian vector fields and $A$ arises from a torus automorphism, hence preserves the integral lattice $\\mathbb{Z}_T^*$ and the $\\mathbb{Z}$-basis condition at vertices.**\nThis is **Correct**. This option accurately describes the group of integral-affine transformations. It provides the correct justification for the translation part: shifting the moment map by a constant $b$ does not change its defining property relative to the Hamiltonian vector fields. It also provides the correct justification for the linear part: a linear map $A \\in \\operatorname{GL}(n, \\mathbb{Z})$ (in an appropriate basis) corresponds to an automorphism of the torus $T$, which by definition preserves the integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}_T^*$ and therefore the Delzant condition on the polytope's vertices.\n\n**C. Only translations by $b$ are allowed, because the moment map can be shifted by a constant, but no nontrivial linear map can preserve the symplectic form or the torus action.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. It is too restrictive. While it correctly identifies the reason for allowing translations, it incorrectly disallows all non-trivial linear maps. As explained, linear maps in $\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\mathbb{Z})$ are allowed, as they correspond to automorphisms of the acting torus, leading to an equivalent toric manifold.\n\n**D. Any volume-preserving linear transformation $A$ with $\\det(A)=\\pm 1$ and any translation by $b$ are allowed, because such $A$ preserves oriented volume and thus does not affect the symplectic classification implied by the image polytope.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. The condition that $A \\in \\operatorname{GL}(n, \\mathbb{Z})$ implies that $\\det(A) = \\pm 1$. However, the converse is not true. There are many matrices with determinant $\\pm 1$ that do not have integer entries (e.g., the rotation by $\\pi/4$ from option A) or that have non-integer entries and do not preserve the integer lattice. The condition $A \\in \\operatorname{GL}(n, \\mathbb{Z})$ is strictly stronger than $\\det(A)=\\pm 1$.\n\n**E. Rotations by rational angles together with translations are allowed, because rational angles preserve rational directions and thus keep inward facet normals in the rational span of $\\mathbb{Z}_T^*$.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. Firstly, the term \"rotation by a rational angle\" is ambiguous, but under any reasonable interpretation, this is false. For instance, a rotation by an angle $\\theta$ such that $\\cos(\\theta)$ and $\\sin(\\theta)$ are rational (e.g., corresponding to the Pythagorean triple $3,4,5$) does not generally have integer matrix entries and will not preserve $\\mathbb{Z}^n$. Secondly, the justification is flawed. The condition is not that normals remain in the *rational span* of the lattice, but in the lattice itself. More than that, they must continue to form a $\\mathbb{Z}$-*basis* of the lattice, a much stronger condition.",

This vertex, let's call it $v_{13}$, is the point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ that simultaneously satisfies the equality conditions for the facets corresponding to $u_1$ and $u_3$. These conditions are:\n$$\n\\langle x, u_1 \\rangle = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\langle x, u_3 \\rangle = -1\n$$\nSubstituting the given vectors, we obtain a system of linear equations for the coordinates $(x_1, x_2)$ of the vertex:\n$$\nx_1 = 0\n$$\n$$\n-x_1 - 3x_2 = -1\n$$\nSubstituting $x_1=0$ into the second equation yields $-3x_2 = -1$, which gives $x_2 = \\frac{1}{3}$. Thus, the vertex is $v_{13} = (0, \\frac{1}{3})$.\n\nThe local structure of a toric variety or orbifold at a fixed point is determined by the geometry of the moment polytope vertex corresponding to that fixed point. The fixed points of the $T^2$ action are the preimages under the moment map $\\mu$ of the vertices of the polytope $\\Delta$.\n\nAccording to the Delzant theorem for smooth toric manifolds, the space is locally diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{C}^2$ around a fixed point if and only if the primitive inward-pointing normals of the $2$ facets meeting at the corresponding vertex form a $\\mathbb{Z}$-basis for the integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. This is equivalent to the condition that the determinant of the matrix formed by these normal vectors is $\\pm 1$.\n\nThis criterion generalizes to toric orbifolds. If the set of primitive inward-pointing normals $\\{u_i, u_j\\}$ at a vertex is a basis for $\\mathbb{R}^2$ but not for $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, the corresponding fixed point is an orbifold singularity. The local structure is modeled on $\\mathbb{C}^2/G_v$, where $G_v$ is a finite group. For a $T^2$ action on a $4$-manifold, this group is cyclic. The order of this group, $|G_v|$, is given by the absolute value of the determinant of the $2 \\times 2$ matrix whose columns (or rows) are the normal vectors $u_i$ and $u_j$.\n\nFor the vertex $v_{13}$, the incident facet normals are $u_1=(1,0)$ and $u_3=(-1,-3)$. We form the matrix $U$ with these vectors as columns:\n$$\nU = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ 0 & -3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n$$\n\\det(U) = (1)(-3) - (-1)(0) = -3\n$$\nThe order of the local finite cyclic orbifold group $G_{v_{13}}$ is the absolute value of this determinant:\n$$\n|G_{v_{13}}| = |\\det(U)| = |-3| = 3\n$$\nThus, from first principles, the order of the local group is $3$.\n\nNext, we explain the connection to weighted projective spaces and the local quotient structure. The polytope $\\Delta$ is the triangle in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(0, \\frac{1}{3})$. The third side of this triangle is the line connecting $(1,0)$ and $(0, \\frac{1}{3})$, which has the equation $x_1 + 3x_2 = 1$. This corresponds to the inequality $\\langle x, u_3 \\rangle \\ge -1$, i.e., $-x_1-3x_2 \\ge -1$. This polytope is a standard representation of the moment polytope for the weighted projective space $\\mathbb{P}(1,3,1)$, which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{P}(1,1,3)$ by relabeling of homogeneous coordinates.\n\nThe local structure of a toric orbifold at a fixed point $p_v$ (corresponding to a vertex $v$) is described by a local model $\\mathbb{C}^2 / G_v$. This arises from the principles of symplectic reduction. The Lie algebra of the torus is $\\mathfrak{t} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$, and its integer lattice is $\\ker(\\exp: \\mathfrak{t} \\to T^2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2$. The local $T^2$ action on the tangent space $T_{p_v}M \\cong \\mathbb{C}^2$ is linear and, in a suitable complex basis, diagonal. The weights of this action are vectors in the dual lattice $(\\mathbb{Z}^2)^* \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n\nIn a smooth setting (a Delzant manifold), the local model is naturally $\\mathbb{C}^2$. In an orbifold setting, the lattice $\\Lambda_v = \\text{span}_{\\mathbb{Z}}\\{u_1, u_3\\}$ generated by the normals is a proper sublattice of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. The local group $G_v$ is precisely the quotient group $G_v \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2 / \\Lambda_v$. The order of this finite abelian group is the index of the sublattice $\\Lambda_v$ in $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, which is given by the volume of the fundamental parallelogram of $\\Lambda_v$. This volume is $|\\det(U)|$. In our case, the order is $3$, and the group is isomorphic to the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n\nThe action of $G_v$ on $\\mathbb{C}^2$ is the restriction of the linearized $T^2$ action. Since the $T^2$ action is diagonal in an appropriate coordinate system, the action of its finite subgroup $G_v < T^2$ is also diagonal. The group $G_v$ is generated by an element that corresponds to a non-trivial element of $\\mathbb{Z}^2/\\Lambda_v$. The action is of the form $g \\cdot (z_1, z_2) = (\\rho_1(g)z_1, \\rho_2(g)z_2)$, where $\\rho_1, \\rho_2$ are characters determined by the embedding of $G_v$ in $T^2$. This explains why the local model is a cyclic quotient of $\\mathbb{C}^2$ by a diagonal action.",
