            "problem": "Let $M=\\mathbb{C}\\cong\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$ and the standard symplectic form $\\omega=dx\\wedge dy$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is a well-posed and standard exercise in symplectic geometry and is therefore deemed valid. It provides a clear and self-contained set of instructions for computing the moment map associated with the rotational action of the circle group $S^1$ on the complex plane $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nThe solution proceeds by following the steps outlined in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we write the explicit formula for the group action $\\Phi:G\\times M\\to M$. The group is $G=S^{1}$, which we can represent as $\\{e^{i\\theta} | \\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)\\}$. The manifold is $M=\\mathbb{C}\\cong\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, with a point represented by $z=x+iy$ or as the coordinate pair $(x,y)$. The action of rotation by an angle $\\theta$, represented by the group element $g=e^{i\\theta} \\in S^{1}$, on a point $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ is given by complex multiplication:\n$$\n\\Phi(g, z) = gz = e^{i\\theta}z\n$$\nExpanding this in terms of the real coordinates $(x,y)$:\n$$\ne^{i\\theta}z = (\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta)(x+iy) = (x\\cos\\theta - y\\sin\\theta) + i(x\\sin\\theta + y\\cos\\theta)\n$$\nThus, the action in Cartesian coordinates is:\n$$\n\\Phi(e^{i\\theta}, (x,y)) = (x\\cos\\theta - y\\sin\\theta, x\\sin\\theta + y\\cos\\theta)\n$$\n\nSecond, we identify the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ of $G=S^{1}$ and compute the fundamental vector field $X_{\\xi}$. The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}=T_e G$ is the tangent space to the group at the identity element $e=1$. For $S^1$, this is isomorphic to the real numbers, $\\mathfrak{g}\\cong\\mathbb{R}$. The problem specifies the generator $\\xi=1 \\in \\mathfrak{g}$. A one-parameter subgroup generated by $\\xi=1$ in $S^1$ is given by the curve $\\gamma(t) = e^{it}$ for $t\\in\\mathbb{R}$. The fundamental vector field $X_{\\xi}$ at a point $p=(x,y) \\in M$ is defined as the infinitesimal generator of the action corresponding to $\\xi$:\n$$\nX_{\\xi}(p) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\Phi(\\gamma(t), p) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\Phi(e^{it}, (x,y))\n$$\nUsing the formula for the action:\n$$\nX_{\\xi}((x,y)) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} (x\\cos t - y\\sin t, x\\sin t + y\\cos t)\n$$\nWe compute the derivative of each component with respect to $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(x\\cos t - y\\sin t) = -x\\sin t - y\\cos t\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(x\\sin t + y\\cos t) = x\\cos t - y\\sin t\n$$\nEvaluating at $t=0$:\n$$\n(-x\\sin(0) - y\\cos(0), x\\cos(0) - y\\sin(0)) = (-y, x)\n$$\nSo the fundamental vector field corresponding to the generator $\\xi=1$ is:\n$$\nX_{\\xi} = -y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\n$$\n\nThird, we determine if the action is Hamiltonian by checking for the existence of a moment map component $\\mu:M\\to\\mathbb{R}$. The defining relation is $d\\mu = \\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega$. We compute the interior product $\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega$ of the fundamental vector field $X_{\\xi}$ with the symplectic form $\\omega=dx\\wedge dy$.\nThe interior product of a vector field $V$ with a $2$-form $\\alpha$ is a $1$-form $(\\iota_V \\alpha)$ defined by $(\\iota_V \\alpha)(W) = \\alpha(V, W)$ for any vector field $W$. Here, $V=X_{\\xi}$.\nLet $\\alpha = \\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega$. Then for an arbitrary vector field $W = W_x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + W_y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$:\n$$\n\\alpha(W) = \\omega(X_{\\xi}, W) = (dx\\wedge dy)\\left(-y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}, W_x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + W_y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the determinant of the matrix of components:\n$$\n\\alpha(W) = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} -y & W_x \\\\ x & W_y \\end{pmatrix} = -yW_y - xW_x\n$$\nIf we write the $1$-form $\\alpha$ as $\\alpha = \\alpha_x dx + \\alpha_y dy$, its action on $W$ is $\\alpha(W) = \\alpha_x W_x + \\alpha_y W_y$. Comparing this with the above expression, we must have $\\alpha_x = -x$ and $\\alpha_y = -y$. Therefore, the $1$-form is:\n$$\n\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega = -x\\,dx - y\\,dy\n$$\nFor this action to be Hamiltonian, this $1$-form must be exact, i.e., it must be the exterior derivative of some function $\\mu$. A $1$-form $P\\,dx + Q\\,dy$ on a simply-connected domain like $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is exact if and only if it is closed, which means $\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}$. Here, $P=-x$ and $Q=-y$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial(-x)}{\\partial y} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial(-y)}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nSince the condition is satisfied, the form is closed and hence exact. Thus, a moment map component $\\mu$ exists, and the action is Hamiltonian.\n\nFourth, we find the explicit expression for $\\mu(x,y)$ by integrating the $1$-form. We need to find $\\mu$ such that $d\\mu = -x\\,dx - y\\,dy$. The exterior derivative of $\\mu$ is $d\\mu = \\frac{\\partial\\mu}{\\partial x}dx + \\frac{\\partial\\mu}{\\partial y}dy$. By comparing coefficients, we have the system of partial differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\mu}{\\partial x} = -x\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\mu}{\\partial y} = -y\n$$\nIntegrating the first equation with respect to $x$ gives:\n$$\n\\mu(x,y) = \\int (-x)\\,dx = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2 + C(y)\n$$\nwhere $C(y)$ is a function of $y$. Differentiating this with respect to $y$ and substituting into the second equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\mu}{\\partial y} = \\frac{dC}{dy} = -y\n$$\nIntegrating this with respect to $y$ gives $C(y) = \\int(-y)\\,dy = -\\frac{1}{2}y^2 + K$, where $K$ is a constant of integration. Combining these results, we get the general form for the moment map component:\n$$\n\\mu(x,y) = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2 - \\frac{1}{2}y^2 + K = -\\frac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2) + K\n$$\nThe moment map is defined up to an additive constant. A standard choice is to set the constant $K$ to $0$, which corresponds to setting $\\mu(0,0)=0$. This yields the specific expression for the moment map component:\n$$\n\\mu(x,y) = -\\frac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2)\n$$\n\nFinally, regarding singular reduction, the existence of stabilizers affects the regularity of the reduced spaces. The Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer reduction theorem guarantees that for a regular value $c$ of the moment map $\\mu$, if the group action on the level set $\\mu^{-1}(c)$ is free and proper, the reduced space $\\mu^{-1}(c)/G$ is a smooth symplectic manifold. A value $c$ is regular if $d\\mu_p$ is surjective for all $p \\in \\mu^{-1}(c)$. For $\\mu(x,y) = -\\frac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2)$, we have $d\\mu = -x\\,dx - y\\,dy$, which is zero only at the origin $(0,0)$. The value of the moment map at this point is $\\mu(0,0)=0$. Thus, $c=0$ is the only critical value.\nThe point $(0,0)$ is a fixed point of the $S^1$ action, meaning its stabilizer subgroup is the entire group, $G_{(0,0)}=S^1$. For any other point $p \\neq (0,0)$, the action is free, and the stabilizer is trivial, $G_p=\\{e\\}$.\nThe presence of a point with a non-trivial stabilizer, like the origin, in a level set indicates that the corresponding value of the moment map is singular. The reduced space at such a singular level, $M_0=\\mu^{-1}(0)/G$ in this case, is not guaranteed to be a smooth manifold. It is, in general, a stratified symplectic space, where the stratification is determined by the orbit types (i.e., by the conjugacy classes of the stabilizer subgroups). In this particular problem, the singular level set $\\mu^{-1}(0)$ is just the origin itself, and the reduced space is a single point, which happens to be trivially smooth. However, in more complex systems, such singularities in the reduction procedure give rise to geometric structures like orbifolds or cones.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of symplectic geometry and geometric mechanics, well-posed with a clear objective, and free of any ambiguity or contradiction. All necessary information is provided to derive the requested quantities.\n\nThe problem asks for two main results: $1$) the explicit formula for the momentum map $J$ for a given Hamiltonian torus action on $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$, and $2$) the characterization of its image, $\\operatorname{Im} J$.\n\nFirst, we derive the momentum map $J: \\mathbb{C}^{n} \\to \\mathfrak{t}^{*} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{k}$. The starting point is the defining relation $dH_{\\xi} = \\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega_{0}$, where $H_{\\xi}(z) = \\langle J(z), \\xi \\rangle$.\n\nThe infinitesimal generator $X_{\\xi}$ of the action for an element $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{t} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{k}$ is found by differentiating the action at the identity. The action is given by\n$$\n\\exp(\\xi) \\cdot z = \\left(\\exp\\left(i\\langle w_{1},\\xi\\rangle\\right) z_{1}, \\dots, \\exp\\left(i\\langle w_{n},\\xi\\rangle\\right) z_{n}\\right).\n$$\nThe vector field $X_{\\xi}$ at a point $z \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n}$ is\n$$\nX_{\\xi}(z) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\left( \\exp\\left(i\\langle w_{1},t\\xi\\rangle\\right) z_{1}, \\dots, \\exp\\left(i\\langle w_{n},t\\xi\\rangle\\right) z_{n} \\right) = \\left( i\\langle w_{1},\\xi\\rangle z_{1}, \\dots, i\\langle w_{n},\\xi\\rangle z_{n} \\right).\n$$\nTo work with the given real symplectic form $\\omega_{0} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} dx_{j} \\wedge dy_{j}$, we express $X_{\\xi}$ in real coordinates $(x_{j}, y_{j})$, where $z_{j} = x_{j} + i y_{j}$. The $j$-th complex component of the vector field is $i\\langle w_{j},\\xi\\rangle z_{j} = i\\langle w_{j},\\xi\\rangle (x_{j} + iy_{j}) = -\\langle w_{j},\\xi\\rangle y_{j} + i\\langle w_{j},\\xi\\rangle x_{j}$. This corresponds to the real vector $(-\\langle w_{j},\\xi\\rangle y_{j}, \\langle w_{j},\\xi\\rangle x_{j})$. Thus, the vector field on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ is\n$$\nX_{\\xi} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left( -\\langle w_{j},\\xi\\rangle y_{j} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{j}} + \\langle w_{j},\\xi\\rangle x_{j} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_{j}} \\right).\n$$\nNext, we compute the interior product $\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega_{0}$.\n$$\n\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega_{0} = \\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} dx_{j} \\wedge dy_{j}\\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left( (\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}dx_{j}) \\wedge dy_{j} - dx_{j} \\wedge (\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}dy_{j}) \\right).\n$$\nWe evaluate the contractions $\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}dx_{j} = dx_{j}(X_{\\xi}) = -\\langle w_{j},\\xi\\rangle y_{j}$ and $\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}dy_{j} = dy_{j}(X_{\\xi}) = \\langle w_{j},\\xi\\rangle x_{j}$. Substituting these into the expression gives\n$$\n\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega_{0} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left( (-\\langle w_{j},\\xi\\rangle y_{j}) dy_{j} - dx_{j} (\\langle w_{j},\\xi\\rangle x_{j}) \\right) = - \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\langle w_{j},\\xi\\rangle (x_{j}dx_{j} + y_{j}dy_{j}).\n$$\nRecognizing that $d(\\frac{1}{2}|z_{j}|^{2}) = d(\\frac{1}{2}(x_{j}^{2} + y_{j}^{2})) = x_{j}dx_{j} + y_{j}dy_{j}$, we have\n$$\n\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega_{0} = - \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\langle w_{j},\\xi\\rangle d\\left(\\frac{1}{2}|z_{j}|^{2}\\right) = d\\left(-\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{2} |z_{j}|^{2} \\langle w_{j}, \\xi \\rangle\\right).\n$$\nUsing the linearity of the pairing, this becomes\n$$\n\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega_{0} = d\\left(\\left\\langle -\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} |z_{j}|^{2} w_{j}, \\xi \\right\\rangle\\right).\n$$\nAccording to the problem statement, $dH_{\\xi} = \\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega_{0}$. Therefore, we can identify the Hamiltonian $H_{\\xi}$ by integrating:\n$$\nH_{\\xi}(z) = \\left\\langle -\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} |z_{j}|^{2} w_{j}, \\xi \\right\\rangle + C.\n$$\nBy convention, the momentum map is normalized to be zero at the origin, i.e., $J(0) = 0$, which implies the constant of integration $C$ is zero. Comparing with the definition $H_{\\xi}(z) = \\langle J(z), \\xi \\rangle$, which must hold for all $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{t}$, we deduce the explicit formula for the momentum map:\n$$\nJ(z) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} |z_{j}|^{2} w_{j}.\n$$\nSecond, we determine the image of $J$. Let $u_{j} = \\frac{1}{2}|z_{j}|^{2}$. Since $z_{j}$ can be any complex number, $|z_{j}|^{2}$ can be any non-negative real number. Thus, each $u_{j}$ can be any number in $[0, \\infty)$. Let $u = (u_{1}, u_{2}, \\dots, u_{n})^{T}$ be a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The condition on the coefficients $u_{j}$ means that $u$ belongs to the non-negative orthant $\\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}^{n}$. The momentum map can be written as\n$$\nJ(z) = -\\sum_{j=1}^{n} u_{j} w_{j}.\n$$\nThis is a linear combination of the vectors $\\{-w_{j}\\}_{j=1}^{n}$ with non-negative coefficients. In matrix notation, where $W$ is the $k \\times n$ matrix with columns $w_{j}$, this expression is $-Wu$. The image of $J$ is therefore the set of all such vectors:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Im} J = \\left\\{ -Wu \\mid u \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}^{n} \\right\\}.\n$$\nThis set is precisely the convex cone generated by the columns of the matrix $-W$, which are the vectors $\\{-w_{1}, \\dots, -w_{n}\\}$. This cone is denoted $\\text{cone}(\\{-w_{j}\\}_{j=1}^{n})$.\n\nThe problem also asks for a justification of the properties of this cone. The cone $\\operatorname{Im} J$ is polyhedral because it is generated by a finite set of vectors. It is rational because the generating vectors $w_{j}$ are given to be in $\\mathbb{Z}^{k}$, which is a subset of the rational vectors $\\mathbb{Q}^{k}$.\n\nThe face structure of this polyhedral cone is directly related to the stratification of $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$ by the isotropy types of the $\\mathbb{T}^{k}$-action. A point $\\mu \\in \\operatorname{Im} J$ is in the relative interior of a face generated by a subset of vectors $\\{-w_{j}\\}_{j \\in I}$ for some index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ if and only if $\\mu = -\\sum_{j \\in I} u_{j} w_{j}$ with $u_{j} > 0$ for all $j \\in I$. The preimage $J^{-1}(\\mu)$ consists of points $z \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n}$ where $\\frac{1}{2}|z_{j}|^{2} = u_{j}$ for $j \\in I$ and $|z_{j}|^{2} = 0$ for $j \\notin I$. This means that the preimage of the entire relative interior of this face consists of the coordinate subspace stratum where $z_{j} \\ne 0$ for $j \\in I$ and $z_{j} = 0$ for $j \\notin I$. All points within such a stratum possess the same isotropy subgroup, thereby demonstrating the correspondence between the geometry of the image cone and the symmetry properties of the action.",

Thus, the corresponding fundamental vector fields are\n$$\nX_{e_{1}} = \\left(-y_{1} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{1}} + x_{1} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_{1}}\\right) + \\left(-y_{2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{2}} + x_{2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_{2}}\\right),\n$$\n$$\nX_{e_{2}} = \\left(-y_{2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{2}} + x_{2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_{2}}\\right) + \\left(-y_{3} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{3}} + x_{3} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_{3}}\\right).\n$$\nFor a single coordinate $(x,y)$, the contraction of the symplectic form with the rotation generator $-y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$ satisfies\n$$\n\\iota_{-y \\partial_{x} + x \\partial_{y}}(dx \\wedge dy) = -y\\,dy - x\\,dx = - d\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(x^{2} + y^{2})\\right).\n$$\nUsing linearity of $\\iota$ and the fact that $\\omega = \\sum_{j} dx_{j} \\wedge dy_{j}$, we obtain\n$$\n\\iota_{X_{e_{1}}} \\omega = - d\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(x_{1}^{2} + y_{1}^{2}) + \\frac{1}{2}(x_{2}^{2} + y_{2}^{2})\\right),\n$$\n$$\n\\iota_{X_{e_{2}}} \\omega = - d\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(x_{2}^{2} + y_{2}^{2}) + \\frac{1}{2}(x_{3}^{2} + y_{3}^{2})\\right).\n$$\nBy the defining convention $\\iota_{X_{\\xi}} \\omega = - d \\langle J, \\xi \\rangle$, it follows that the momentum map $J = (J_{1}, J_{2}) : \\mathbb{C}^{3} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is given by\n$$\nJ_{1}(z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(|z_{1}|^{2} + |z_{2}|^{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(x_{1}^{2} + y_{1}^{2} + x_{2}^{2} + y_{2}^{2}\\right),\n$$\n$$\nJ_{2}(z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(|z_{2}|^{2} + |z_{3}|^{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(x_{2}^{2} + y_{2}^{2} + x_{3}^{2} + y_{3}^{2}\\right).\n$$\n\nWe now compute the differential $dJ$ explicitly. Differentiating the above expressions yields\n$$\ndJ_{1} = x_{1}\\,dx_{1} + y_{1}\\,dy_{1} + x_{2}\\,dx_{2} + y_{2}\\,dy_{2},\n$$\n$$\ndJ_{2} = x_{2}\\,dx_{2} + y_{2}\\,dy_{2} + x_{3}\\,dx_{3} + y_{3}\\,dy_{3}.\n$$\nThese are one-forms on $\\mathbb{R}^{6}$, and the differential $dJ$ at a point is the linear map $T_{z}\\mathbb{R}^{6} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ given by $v \\mapsto (dJ_{1}(v), dJ_{2}(v))$.\n\nEvaluate at $p = (0,r,0)$ with $z_{2} = r$ real and all other coordinates zero, that is $x_{2} = r$, $y_{2} = 0$, and $x_{1} = y_{1} = x_{3} = y_{3} = 0$. Then\n$$\ndJ_{1}\\big|_{p} = r\\,dx_{2}, \\qquad dJ_{2}\\big|_{p} = r\\,dx_{2}.\n$$\nHence the image of $dJ\\big|_{p}$ is spanned by the single vector $(1,1)$ times the scalar $r\\,dx_{2}$. The $2 \\times 6$ Jacobian at $p$ therefore has rank $1$. Since the target is $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, and the maximal possible rank of $dJ$ is $2$, this shows $dJ\\big|_{p}$ is not surjective. Consequently, the momentum map $J$ fails to be a submersion at $p$.\n\nNext, compute $c = J(p)$. Since $J_{1}(p) = \\frac{1}{2} r^{2}$ and $J_{2}(p) = \\frac{1}{2} r^{2}$, we have $c = \\left(\\frac{r^{2}}{2}, \\frac{r^{2}}{2}\\right)$. Consider the point $q = \\big(s, \\sqrt{r^{2} - s^{2}}, s\\big)$ with $s \\in (0,r)$ and imaginary parts zero ($y_{j} = 0$). Then\n$$\nJ_{1}(q) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(s^{2} + (r^{2} - s^{2})\\right) = \\frac{r^{2}}{2}, \\qquad\nJ_{2}(q) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left((r^{2} - s^{2}) + s^{2}\\right) = \\frac{r^{2}}{2},\n$$\nso $q \\in J^{-1}(c)$ and $q$ is in the same level set as $p$. The differentials at $q$ are\n$$\ndJ_{1}\\big|_{q} = s\\,dx_{1} + \\sqrt{r^{2} - s^{2}}\\,dx_{2}, \\qquad\ndJ_{2}\\big|_{q} = \\sqrt{r^{2} - s^{2}}\\,dx_{2} + s\\,dx_{3}.\n$$\nTo compute the rank of $dJ\\big|_{q}$, note that as one-forms the two rows have disjoint support in $dx_{1}$ and $dx_{3}$ respectively, with a shared component in $dx_{2}$. Explicitly, with respect to the subspace spanned by $(dx_{1}, dx_{2}, dx_{3})$, the $2 \\times 3$ matrix of coefficients is\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\ns & \\sqrt{r^{2} - s^{2}} & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\sqrt{r^{2} - s^{2}} & s\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nFor $s \\in (0,r)$, both $s$ and $\\sqrt{r^{2} - s^{2}}$ are strictly positive. The two rows are not proportional because the first has nonzero coefficient in $dx_{1}$ while the second has zero there, and conversely for $dx_{3}$. Therefore the rank of this $2 \\times 3$ matrix is $2$, and hence $\\mathrm{rank}\\,dJ\\big|_{q} = 2$. This is the maximal possible rank for $dJ$.\n\nWe have exhibited two points in the same level set $J^{-1}(c)$: a point $p$ at which $dJ$ has rank $1$ and a point $q$ at which $dJ$ has rank $2$. Since a regular value requires $dJ$ to be surjective at every point of the level set, the value $c$ is not regular. This demonstrates the failure of submersion near a non-regular value and connects to the appearance of singularities and stratification in the reduced space.\n\nFinally, the rank drop $\\Delta$ is defined as the difference between the maximal rank attained near $c$ and the rank at $p$:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\mathrm{rank}\\,dJ\\big|_{q} - \\mathrm{rank}\\,dJ\\big|_{p} = 2 - 1 = 1.\n$$\nThus, the computed rank drop in this concrete torus action is $1$.",
