            "solution": "The problem statement is a well-posed and standard exercise in symplectic geometry and is therefore deemed valid. It provides a clear and self-contained set of instructions for computing the moment map associated with the rotational action of the circle group $S^1$ on the complex plane $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nThe solution proceeds by following the steps outlined in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we write the explicit formula for the group action $\\Phi:G\\times M\\to M$. The group is $G=S^{1}$, which we can represent as $\\{e^{i\\theta} | \\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)\\}$. The manifold is $M=\\mathbb{C}\\cong\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, with a point represented by $z=x+iy$ or as the coordinate pair $(x,y)$. The action of rotation by an angle $\\theta$, represented by the group element $g=e^{i\\theta} \\in S^{1}$, on a point $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ is given by complex multiplication:\n$$\n\\Phi(g, z) = gz = e^{i\\theta}z\n$$\nExpanding this in terms of the real coordinates $(x,y)$:\n$$\ne^{i\\theta}z = (\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta)(x+iy) = (x\\cos\\theta - y\\sin\\theta) + i(x\\sin\\theta + y\\cos\\theta)\n$$\nThus, the action in Cartesian coordinates is:\n$$\n\\Phi(e^{i\\theta}, (x,y)) = (x\\cos\\theta - y\\sin\\theta, x\\sin\\theta + y\\cos\\theta)\n$$\n\nSecond, we identify the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ of $G=S^{1}$ and compute the fundamental vector field $X_{\\xi}$. The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}=T_e G$ is the tangent space to the group at the identity element $e=1$. For $S^1$, this is isomorphic to the real numbers, $\\mathfrak{g}\\cong\\mathbb{R}$. The problem specifies the generator $\\xi=1 \\in \\mathfrak{g}$. A one-parameter subgroup generated by $\\xi=1$ in $S^1$ is given by the curve $\\gamma(t) = e^{it}$ for $t\\in\\mathbb{R}$. The fundamental vector field $X_{\\xi}$ at a point $p=(x,y) \\in M$ is defined as the infinitesimal generator of the action corresponding to $\\xi$:\n$$\nX_{\\xi}(p) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\Phi(\\gamma(t), p) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\Phi(e^{it}, (x,y))\n$$\nUsing the formula for the action:\n$$\nX_{\\xi}((x,y)) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} (x\\cos t - y\\sin t, x\\sin t + y\\cos t)\n$$\nWe compute the derivative of each component with respect to $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(x\\cos t - y\\sin t) = -x\\sin t - y\\cos t\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(x\\sin t + y\\cos t) = x\\cos t - y\\sin t\n$$\nEvaluating at $t=0$:\n$$\n(-x\\sin(0) - y\\cos(0), x\\cos(0) - y\\sin(0)) = (-y, x)\n$$\nSo the fundamental vector field corresponding to the generator $\\xi=1$ is:\n$$\nX_{\\xi} = -y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\n$$\n\nThird, we determine if the action is Hamiltonian by checking for the existence of a moment map component $\\mu:M\\to\\mathbb{R}$. The defining relation is $d\\mu = \\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega$. We compute the interior product $\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega$ of the fundamental vector field $X_{\\xi}$ with the symplectic form $\\omega=dx\\wedge dy$.\nThe interior product of a vector field $V$ with a $2$-form $\\alpha$ is a $1$-form $(\\iota_V \\alpha)$ defined by $(\\iota_V \\alpha)(W) = \\alpha(V, W)$ for any vector field $W$. Here, $V=X_{\\xi}$.\nLet $\\alpha = \\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega$. Then for an arbitrary vector field $W = W_x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + W_y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$:\n$$\n\\alpha(W) = \\omega(X_{\\xi}, W) = (dx\\wedge dy)\\left(-y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}, W_x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + W_y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the determinant of the matrix of components:\n$$\n\\alpha(W) = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} -y  W_x \\\\ x  W_y \\end{pmatrix} = -yW_y - xW_x\n$$\nIf we write the $1$-form $\\alpha$ as $\\alpha = \\alpha_x dx + \\alpha_y dy$, its action on $W$ is $\\alpha(W) = \\alpha_x W_x + \\alpha_y W_y$. Comparing this with the above expression, we must have $\\alpha_x = -x$ and $\\alpha_y = -y$. Therefore, the $1$-form is:\n$$\n\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega = -x\\,dx - y\\,dy\n$$\nFor this action to be Hamiltonian, this $1$-form must be exact, i.e., it must be the exterior derivative of some function $\\mu$. A $1$-form $P\\,dx + Q\\,dy$ on a simply-connected domain like $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is exact if and only if it is closed, which means $\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}$. Here, $P=-x$ and $Q=-y$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial(-x)}{\\partial y} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial(-y)}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nSince the condition is satisfied, the form is closed and hence exact. Thus, a moment map component $\\mu$ exists, and the action is Hamiltonian.\n\nFourth, we find the explicit expression for $\\mu(x,y)$ by integrating the $1$-form. We need to find $\\mu$ such that $d\\mu = -x\\,dx - y\\,dy$. The exterior derivative of $\\mu$ is $d\\mu = \\frac{\\partial\\mu}{\\partial x}dx + \\frac{\\partial\\mu}{\\partial y}dy$. By comparing coefficients, we have the system of partial differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\mu}{\\partial x} = -x\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\mu}{\\partial y} = -y\n$$\nIntegrating the first equation with respect to $x$ gives:\n$$\n\\mu(x,y) = \\int (-x)\\,dx = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2 + C(y)\n$$\nwhere $C(y)$ is a function of $y$. Differentiating this with respect to $y$ and substituting into the second equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\mu}{\\partial y} = \\frac{dC}{dy} = -y\n$$\nIntegrating this with respect to $y$ gives $C(y) = \\int(-y)\\,dy = -\\frac{1}{2}y^2 + K$, where $K$ is a constant of integration. Combining these results, we get the general form for the moment map component:\n$$\n\\mu(x,y) = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2 - \\frac{1}{2}y^2 + K = -\\frac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2) + K\n$$\nThe moment map is defined up to an additive constant. A standard choice is to set the constant $K$ to $0$, which corresponds to setting $\\mu(0,0)=0$. This yields the specific expression for the moment map component:\n$$\n\\mu(x,y) = -\\frac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2)\n$$\n\nFinally, regarding singular reduction, the existence of stabilizers affects the regularity of the reduced spaces. The Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer reduction theorem guarantees that for a regular value $c$ of the moment map $\\mu$, if the group action on the level set $\\mu^{-1}(c)$ is free and proper, the reduced space $\\mu^{-1}(c)/G$ is a smooth symplectic manifold. A value $c$ is regular if $d\\mu_p$ is surjective for all $p \\in \\mu^{-1}(c)$. For $\\mu(x,y) = -\\frac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2)$, we have $d\\mu = -x\\,dx - y\\,dy$, which is zero only at the origin $(0,0)$. The value of the moment map at this point is $\\mu(0,0)=0$. Thus, $c=0$ is the only critical value.\nThe point $(0,0)$ is a fixed point of the $S^1$ action, meaning its stabilizer subgroup is the entire group, $G_{(0,0)}=S^1$. For any other point $p \\neq (0,0)$, the action is free, and the stabilizer is trivial, $G_p=\\{e\\}$.\nThe presence of a point with a non-trivial stabilizer, like the origin, in a level set indicates that the corresponding value of the moment map is singular. The reduced space at such a singular level, $M_0=\\mu^{-1}(0)/G$ in this case, is not guaranteed to be a smooth manifold. It is, in general, a stratified symplectic space, where the stratification is determined by the orbit types (i.e., by the conjugacy classes of the stabilizer subgroups). In this particular problem, the singular level set $\\mu^{-1}(0)$ is just the origin itself, and the reduced space is a single point, which happens to be trivially smooth. However, in more complex systems, such singularities in the reduction procedure give rise to geometric structures like orbifolds or cones.",

            "solution": "We begin from the defining properties of Hamiltonian group actions and the momentum map. For a Hamiltonian action of a Lie group $G$ on a symplectic manifold $(M,\\omega)$, with Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, the momentum map $J : M \\to \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$ is defined by\n$$\n\\iota_{X_{\\xi}} \\omega = - d \\langle J, \\xi \\rangle \\quad \\text{for all } \\xi \\in \\mathfrak{g},\n$$\nwhere $X_{\\xi}$ is the infinitesimal generator of the action corresponding to $\\xi$.\n\nIn our case, $G = \\mathrm{T}^{2}$ is the two-dimensional torus, $\\mathfrak{t} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, and the action is linear and unitary on $\\mathbb{C}^{3}$ with weights $\\boldsymbol{w}_{1} = (1,0)$ on $z_{1}$, $\\boldsymbol{w}_{2} = (1,1)$ on $z_{2}$, and $\\boldsymbol{w}_{3} = (0,1)$ on $z_{3}$. Writing complex coordinates $z_{j} = x_{j} + \\mathrm{i} y_{j}$, and the standard symplectic form $\\omega = \\sum_{j} dx_{j} \\wedge dy_{j}$, the infinitesimal generator for the first circle factor ($\\xi = e_{1}$) acts as simultaneous rotations on $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$, and the second circle factor ($\\xi = e_{2}$) acts as simultaneous rotations on $z_{2}$ and $z_{3}$.

The $2 \\times 6$ Jacobian at $p$ therefore has rank $1$. Since the target is $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, and the maximal possible rank of $dJ$ is $2$, this shows $dJ\\big|_{p}$ is not surjective. Consequently, the momentum map $J$ fails to be a submersion at $p$.\n\nNext, compute $c = J(p)$.

Explicitly, with respect to the subspace spanned by $(dx_{1}, dx_{2}, dx_{3})$, the $2 \\times 3$ matrix of coefficients is\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\ns  \\sqrt{r^{2} - s^{2}}  0 \\\\\n0  \\sqrt{r^{2} - s^{2}}  s\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nFor $s \\in (0,r)$, both $s$ and $\\sqrt{r^{2} - s^{2}}$ are strictly positive. The two rows are not proportional because the first has nonzero coefficient in $dx_{1}$ while the second has zero there, and conversely for $dx_{3}$. Therefore the rank of this $2 \\times 3$ matrix is $2$, and hence $\\mathrm{rank}\\,dJ\\big|_{q} = 2$. This is the maximal possible rank for $dJ$.\n\nWe have exhibited two points in the same level set $J^{-1}(c)$: a point $p$ at which $dJ$ has rank $1$ and a point $q$ at which $dJ$ has rank $2$. Since a regular value requires $dJ$ to be surjective at every point of the level set, the value $c$ is not regular. This demonstrates the failure of submersion near a non-regular value and connects to the appearance of singularities and stratification in the reduced space.\n\nFinally, the rank drop $\\Delta$ is defined as the difference between the maximal rank attained near $c$ and the rank at $p$:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\mathrm{rank}\\,dJ\\big|_{q} - \\mathrm{rank}\\,dJ\\big|_{p} = 2 - 1 = 1.\n$$\nThus, the computed rank drop in this concrete torus action is $1$.",

The admissible values of $z_{1}$ are those that ensure both points lie on their spheres:\n$$\nz_{1} \\in I_{\\mu_{\\mathrm{int}}} := \\left[\\max\\{-R_{1},\\, \\mu_{\\mathrm{int}} - R_{2}\\},\\; \\min\\{R_{1},\\, \\mu_{\\mathrm{int}} + R_{2}\\}\\right].\n$$\nFor a regular interior $\\mu_{\\mathrm{int}}$, this interval $I_{\\mu_{\\mathrm{int}}}$ has nonempty interior, and the $\\mathrm{S}^{1}$ action on $\\Phi^{-1}(\\mu_{\\mathrm{int}})$ is free (no points with $r_{i} = \\sqrt{R_{i}^{2}-z_{i}^{2}}$ simultaneously zero unless $\\mu_{\\mathrm{int}}$ equals a critical value). Therefore, the reduced space\n$$\nM_{\\mu_{\\mathrm{int}}} = \\Phi^{-1}(\\mu_{\\mathrm{int}})/\\mathrm{S}^{1}\n$$\nis a smooth two-dimensional manifold.\n\nWe now identify its topology from first principles. The quotient removes the common shift of $(\\theta_{1},\\theta_{2})$, so a natural residual angle coordinate is the relative angle\n$$\n\\phi := \\theta_{2} - \\theta_{1} \\in \\mathbb{R}/2\\pi\\mathbb{Z},\n$$\npaired with the free height $z_{1} \\in I_{\\mu_{\\mathrm{int}}}$. Away from the endpoints of $I_{\\mu_{\\mathrm{int}}}$, both $r_{1} = \\sqrt{R_{1}^{2}-z_{1}^{2}}$ and $r_{2} = \\sqrt{R_{2}^{2}-(\\mu_{\\mathrm{int}} - z_{1})^{2}}$ are positive, so the residual angle $\\phi$ parametrizes a full circle $S^{1}$. At the endpoints of $I_{\\mu_{\\mathrm{int}}}$, precisely one of $r_{1}$ or $r_{2}$ vanishes, meaning one factor lies at a pole; in that case, the circle parametrized by $\\phi$ collapses to a single point in the quotient because one longitude becomes undefined. Thus, topologically,\n$$\nM_{\\mu_{\\mathrm{int}}} \\cong \\left(I_{\\mu_{\\mathrm{int}}} \\times S^{1}\\right)\\Big/\\text{(each boundary circle collapsed to a point)}.\n$$\nThis space is the suspension of $S^{1}$, which is homeomorphic to a two-sphere:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Susp}(S^{1}) \\cong S^{2}.\n$$\nHence, for regular interior $\\mu_{\\mathrm{int}}$, we have\n$$\nM_{\\mu_{\\mathrm{int}}} \\cong S^{2},\n$$\nso its Euler characteristic is\n$$\n\\chi(M_{\\mu_{\\mathrm{int}}}) = \\chi(S^{2}) = 2.\n$$\n\nWe next analyze the boundary case $\\mu_{\\mathrm{bdry}} = R_{1} + R_{2}$. This is a critical value corresponding to the fixed point $(z_{1},z_{2}) = (R_{1}, R_{2})$. The level set is\n$$\n\\Phi^{-1}(\\mu_{\\mathrm{bdry}}) = \\{(p_{1},p_{2}) \\in S^{2}_{R_{1}} \\times S^{2}_{R_{2}} \\mid z_{1} + z_{2} = R_{1}+R_{2}\\}.\n$$\nThe only way to have $z_{1} + z_{2} = R_{1} + R_{2}$ with $z_{i} \\in [-R_{i},R_{i}]$ is $z_{1} = R_{1}$ and $z_{2} = R_{2}$, i.e., both points are at their north poles. Therefore,\n$$\n\\Phi^{-1}(\\mu_{\\mathrm{bdry}}) = \\{(N_{1}, N_{2})\\},\n$$\na single point. The quotient by $\\mathrm{S}^{1}$ is trivial, so\n$$\nM_{\\mu_{\\mathrm{bdry}}} = \\Phi^{-1}(\\mu_{\\mathrm{bdry}})/\\mathrm{S}^{1} \\cong \\{\\text{point}\\}.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\n\\chi(M_{\\mu_{\\mathrm{bdry}}}) = 1.\n$$\n\nWe have shown from the basic structure of the action and the moment map that the interior reduction yields a smooth manifold $S^{2}$ while the boundary reduction yields a zero-dimensional space (a single point), i.e., two topologically distinct quotients in the sense of stratified symplectic reduction. Finally, we compute the requested difference of Euler characteristics:\n$$\n\\chi(M_{\\mu_{\\mathrm{int}}}) - \\chi(M_{\\mu_{\\mathrm{bdry}}}) = 2 - 1 = 1.\n$$\nNo rounding is required.",
