            "problem": "Let $Q$ be a smooth $n$-dimensional manifold, and let $T^{*}Q$ denote its cotangent bundle with projection $\\pi : T^{*}Q \\to Q$. In geometric mechanics, the canonical $1$-form (also called the tautological $1$-form) $\\theta$ on $T^{*}Q$ is defined by the rule that for each point $\\alpha \\in T^{*}Q$ (a covector at $\\pi(\\alpha) \\in Q$) and each tangent vector $v \\in T_{\\alpha}(T^{*}Q)$, one sets $\\theta_{\\alpha}(v) = \\alpha(\\pi_{*}v)$. The canonical symplectic form is the closed, nondegenerate $2$-form $\\omega = d\\theta$ on $T^{*}Q$. In local coordinates, choose a chart on $Q$ with coordinates $(q^{1}, \\dots, q^{n})$ and the induced canonical coordinates $(q^{1}, \\dots, q^{n}, p_{1}, \\dots, p_{n})$ on $T^{*}Q$, where $(p_{1}, \\dots, p_{n})$ are the fiber coordinates dual to $(dq^{1}, \\dots, dq^{n})$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard exercise in differential and symplectic geometry. All provided definitions and conditions are standard and self-consistent.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts: first, the derivation of the local coordinate expression for the canonical $1$-form $\\theta$ and the symplectic form $\\omega$; second, the verification that the zero section is a Lagrangian submanifold; and third, a brief explanation of the significance of this result for Fukaya categories.\n\nLet $Q$ be a smooth manifold of dimension $n$. We are given local coordinates $(q^{1}, \\dots, q^{n})$ on an open set $U \\subset Q$. These induce canonical coordinates $(q^{1}, \\dots, q^{n}, p_{1}, \\dots, p_{n})$ on the corresponding open set $\\pi^{-1}(U) \\subset T^{*}Q$. A point in $T^{*}Q$ is a pair $(q, \\alpha)$ where $q \\in Q$ and $\\alpha \\in T_q^{*}Q$ is a covector at $q$. In local coordinates, $q = (q^{1}, \\dots, q^{n})$ and $\\alpha$ can be expressed as $\\alpha = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} dq^{i}|_{q}$, where $\\{dq^{i}|_{q}\\}$ is the basis of $T_q^{*}Q$ dual to the tangent space basis $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}}|_{q}\\}$.\n\nThe canonical $1$-form $\\theta$ on $T^{*}Q$ is defined at a point $\\alpha \\in T^{*}Q$ acting on a tangent vector $v \\in T_{\\alpha}(T^{*}Q)$ by the coordinate-free formula:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\alpha}(v) = \\alpha(\\pi_{*}v)\n$$\nHere, $\\pi: T^{*}Q \\to Q$ is the canonical projection, $\\pi(q, \\alpha) = q$, and $\\pi_{*}: T(T^{*}Q) \\to TQ$ is its pushforward (or differential).\n\nTo find the local expression for $\\theta$, let us consider a tangent vector $v \\in T_{\\alpha}(T^{*}Q)$. In the local coordinates $(q^{j}, p_{j})$, the tangent space $T_{\\alpha}(T^{*}Q)$ has a basis given by $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{j}}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{j}}\\}_{j=1}^{n}$. An arbitrary vector $v$ can be written as:\n$$\nv = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left( a^{j} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{j}} + b_{j} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{j}} \\right)\n$$\nfor some coefficients $a^{j}, b_{j} \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The projection map in these coordinates is $\\pi(q^{1}, \\dots, q^{n}, p_{1}, \\dots, p_{n}) = (q^{1}, \\dots, q^{n})$. We compute its pushforward applied to the basis vectors:\n$$\n\\pi_{*}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{j}}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{j}}\n$$\n$$\n\\pi_{*}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{j}}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThe second equality holds because the coordinates $p_{j}$ are fiber coordinates, so a change only in the $p_{j}$ direction corresponds to moving within the fiber over a fixed point $q$, which means the projection onto $Q$ does not move.\nApplying $\\pi_{*}$ to the vector $v$:\n$$\n\\pi_{*}v = \\pi_{*}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} a^{j} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{j}} + b_{j} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{j}}\\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} a^{j} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{j}}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate $\\theta_{\\alpha}(v)$ using its definition. The covector at $\\alpha = (q,p)$ is $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} dq^{i}$:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\alpha}(v) = \\alpha(\\pi_{*}v) = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} dq^{i}\\right) \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} a^{j} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{j}}\\right)\n$$\nBy the duality $dq^{i}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{j}}) = \\delta^{i}_{j}$ (the Kronecker delta), this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\alpha}(v) = \\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} p_{i} a^{j} \\delta^{i}_{j} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} a^{i}\n$$\nWe seek a $1$-form on $T^{*}Q$ whose evaluation on $v$ gives this result. Let's test the form $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} dq^{i}$. The coordinate differentials $dq^{i}$ and $dp_{i}$ act on the basis vectors as $dq^{i}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{j}}) = \\delta^{i}_{j}$, $dq^{i}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{j}})=0$, $dp_{i}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{j}})=0$, and $dp_{i}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{j}})=\\delta_{ij}$. Evaluating this form on $v$:\n$$\n\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} dq^{i}\\right)(v) = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} dq^{i}\\right)\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} a^{j} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{j}} + b_{j} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{j}}\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} a^{i}\n$$\nThis matches our result. Thus, the local expression for the canonical $1$-form is:\n$$\n\\theta = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} dq^{i}\n$$\nThe canonical symplectic form $\\omega$ is the exterior derivative of $\\theta$, $\\omega = d\\theta$. Using the properties of the exterior derivative ($d(fg) = df \\wedge g + f dg$ and $d^{2} = 0$):\n$$\n\\omega = d\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} dq^{i}\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} d(p_{i} dq^{i}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (dp_{i} \\wedge dq^{i} + p_{i} \\wedge d(dq^{i}))\n$$\nSince $d(dq^{i}) = d^{2}q^{i} = 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\omega = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} dp_{i} \\wedge dq^{i}\n$$\nThis is the explicit local expression for the canonical symplectic form.\n\nNext, we verify that the zero section is a Lagrangian submanifold. The zero section is the image of the embedding $i: Q \\hookrightarrow T^{*}Q$ where $i(q) = (q, 0) \\in T^{*}_{q}Q$. In local coordinates, $i(q^{1}, \\dots, q^{n}) = (q^{1}, \\dots, q^{n}, 0, \\dots, 0)$.\nA submanifold $L \\subset (M, \\omega)$ is Lagrangian if it satisfies two conditions:\n$1$. $\\dim L = \\frac{1}{2}\\dim M$.\n$2$. The symplectic form restricts to zero on the tangent space of $L$, i.e., $\\omega|_{TL} = 0$.\n\nFor the zero section $L = i(Q)$, the ambient manifold is $M = T^{*}Q$. We have $\\dim Q = n$ and $\\dim(T^{*}Q) = 2n$. Since $i$ is an embedding, $\\dim L = \\dim Q = n$. The dimension condition is satisfied, as $n = \\frac{1}{2}(2n)$.\n\nTo check the second condition, we compute the pullback of $\\omega$ along the inclusion map $i$, denoted $i^{*}\\omega$. If $i^{*}\\omega = 0$, then the condition holds. The pullback operator $i^{*}$ commutes with the exterior derivative and the wedge product.\n$$\ni^{*}\\omega = i^{*}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} dp_{j} \\wedge dq^{j}\\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} i^{*}(dp_{j}) \\wedge i^{*}(dq^{j})\n$$\nWe first find the pullbacks of the coordinate functions. For any point $(q^{1}, \\dots, q^{n}) \\in Q$:\n$$\n(i^{*}q^{j})(q^{1}, \\dots, q^{n}) = q^{j}(i(q^{1}, \\dots, q^{n})) = q^{j}(q^{1}, \\dots, q^{n}, 0, \\dots, 0) = q^{j}\n$$\n$$\n(i^{*}p_{j})(q^{1}, \\dots, q^{n}) = p_{j}(i(q^{1}, \\dots, q^{n})) = p_{j}(q^{1}, \\dots, q^{n}, 0, \\dots, 0) = 0\n$$\nSo, $i^{*}q^{j} = q^{j}$ and $i^{*}p_{j}$ is the zero function. Now we compute the pullbacks of the $1$-forms:\n$$\ni^{*}(dq^{j}) = d(i^{*}q^{j}) = dq^{j}\n$$\n$$\ni^{*}(dp_{j}) = d(i^{*}p_{j}) = d(0) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $i^{*}\\omega$:\n$$\ni^{*}\\omega = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} 0 \\wedge dq^{j} = 0\n$$\nSince $i^{*}\\omega = 0$, the second condition is satisfied. Thus, the zero section $Q \\subset T^{*}Q$ is a Lagrangian submanifold.\n\nFinally, the existence of this exact Lagrangian submanifold is fundamental to the study of the Fukaya category of the cotangent bundle, $\\mathcal{F}(T^{*}Q)$. The objects of a Fukaya category are Lagrangian submanifolds of the symplectic manifold. The zero section, being Lagrangian, is one such object. Moreover, it is an *exact* Lagrangian, because $i^{*}\\theta = i^{*}(\\sum p_j dq^j) = \\sum (i^{*}p_j)(i^{*}dq^j) = \\sum 0 \\cdot dq^j = 0$, and the zero form is exact. This exactness property is critical for ensuring that the Floer homology groups $HF(L_1, L_2)$, which define the morphism spaces in the Fukaya category, are well-defined and possess the required invariance properties. The composition operations in the Fukaya category are defined by counting pseudo-holomorphic polygons with boundaries on the Lagrangians, and these constructions rely on the analytic properties afforded by exactness. The zero section $Q$ acts as a 'canonical' object in $\\mathcal{F}(T^{*}Q)$. A celebrated result establishes an isomorphism of $A_{\\infty}$-algebras between the Floer homology of the zero section with itself, $HF(Q, Q)$, and the singular homology of the free loop space of the base manifold, $H_*(LQ)$, equipped with the Chas-Sullivan loop product. This provides a profound link between the symplectic geometry of $T^{*}Q$ and the classical topology of $Q$, a link made possible by the existence and properties of the zero section as a foundational exact Lagrangian.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the computation of a quantity $S$ within a specific A-infinity (A$\\infty$) algebra. Before proceeding, we must validate the problem statement.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\nThe givens are:\n- A graded algebra with generators $a$ and $d$.\n- Basis elements $\\{a, b, c, d\\}$.\n- Cohomological gradings: $|a|=0$, $|b|=0$, $|c|=0$, $|d|=-1$.\n- A$\\infty$ operations $m_k$ with degree $|m_k|=2-k$.\n- Definitions for $m_1$: $m_1(d)=c$, and $m_1$ is zero on $a, b, c$.\n- Definitions for $m_2$: $m_2(a,a)=b$, $m_2(b,a)=c$, $m_2(a,b)=0$.

All operations and their inputs/outputs have consistent degrees, a crucial check for graded algebras. For instance, $|m_3(a,a,a)| = |m_3| + 3|a| = (2-3) + 3(0) = -1$, which matches the degree of its result, $|-d| = |d| = -1$. Similarly, $|m_2(b,a)|=|m_2|+|b|+|a| = (2-2)+0+0=0$, matching $|c|=0$. The problem is scientifically grounded in the theory of homological algebra. It is complete, objective, and well-posed. Thus, it is a valid problem.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe structure of an A$\\infty$ algebra is governed by the Stasheff identities. The expression for $S$ is directly related to the $n=3$ Stasheff identity applied to the triple of inputs $(a,a,a)$. The problem statement itself alludes to this by mentioning that $m_3$ serves to correct the failure of associativity of $m_2$.\n\nLet us analyze the $n=3$ Stasheff identity for the inputs $(a_1, a_2, a_3) = (a, a, a)$. The identity is given by:\n$$\n\\sum_{r+s+t=3}(-1)^{r+st} \\, m_{r+1+t}(\\mathrm{id}^{\\otimes r} \\otimes m_s \\otimes \\mathrm{id}^{\\otimes t})(a,a,a) = 0\n$$\nwhere the operations $m_k$ are assumed to be multilinear maps. The summation is over all non-negative integers $r,s,t$ such that $r+s+t=3$ and $s \\ge 1$. We expand this sum term by term.\n\nThe possible values for $(r,s,t)$ partitioning $3$ are:\n1.  $s=1$: $r+t=2$.\n    -   $(r,s,t)=(2,1,0)$: $(-1)^{2+1 \\cdot 0} m_3(a,a,m_1(a)) = m_3(a,a,m_1(a))$\n    -   $(r,s,t)=(1,1,1)$: $(-1)^{1+1 \\cdot 1} m_3(a,m_1(a),a) = m_3(a,m_1(a),a)$\n    -   $(r,s,t)=(0,1,2)$: $(-1)^{0+1 \\cdot 2} m_3(m_1(a),a,a) = m_3(m_1(a),a,a)$\n2.  $s=2$: $r+t=1$.\n    -   $(r,s,t)=(1,2,0)$: $(-1)^{1+2 \\cdot 0} m_2(a,m_2(a,a)) = -m_2(a,m_2(a,a))$\n    -   $(r,s,t)=(0,2,1)$: $(-1)^{0+2 \\cdot 1} m_2(m_2(a,a),a) = m_2(m_2(a,a),a)$\n3.  $s=3$: $r+t=0$.\n    -   $(r,s,t)=(0,3,0)$: $(-1)^{0+3 \\cdot 0} m_1(m_3(a,a,a)) = m_1(m_3(a,a,a))$\n4.  Since $m_k=0$ for $k \\ge 4$, terms with $s \\ge 4$ (which would appear for $n \\ge 4$) are zero, and we only need to consider $m_1, m_2, m_3$.\n\nSumming these terms, the $n=3$ Stasheff identity for inputs $(a,a,a)$ is:\n$$\nm_3(a,a,m_1(a)) + m_3(a,m_1(a),a) + m_3(m_1(a),a,a) + m_2(m_2(a,a),a) - m_2(a,m_2(a,a)) + m_1(m_3(a,a,a)) = 0\n$$\nFrom the problem definition, we have $m_1(a)=0$. Due to the multilinearity of $m_3$, all terms containing $m_1(a)$ as an argument are zero:\n- $m_3(a,a,m_1(a)) = m_3(a,a,0) = 0$\n- $m_3(a,m_1(a),a) = m_3(a,0,a) = 0$\n- $m_3(m_1(a),a,a) = m_3(0,a,a) = 0$\n\nThe identity therefore simplifies to:\n$$\nm_2(m_2(a,a),a) - m_2(a,m_2(a,a)) + m_1(m_3(a,a,a)) = 0\n$$\nThe quantity we are asked to compute is $S = m_1\\big(m_3(a,a,a)\\big)\\;+\\;m_2\\big(m_2(a,a),a\\big)\\;-\\;m_2\\big(a,m_2(a,a)\\big)$. By inspection, this expression is identical to the left-hand side of the simplified Stasheff identity. Therefore, as a direct consequence of the A$\\infty$ algebra structure, we must have $S=0$.\n\nWe can verify this result by direct calculation using the specific definitions provided. Let us compute each term of $S$ individually. The operations $m_k$ are linear maps, so $m_k(\\dots, -x, \\dots) = -m_k(\\dots, x, \\dots)$.\n\n1.  Compute the first term, $m_1(m_3(a,a,a))$:\n    -   According to the problem, $m_3(a,a,a) = -d$.\n    -   Thus, the term becomes $m_1(-d) = -m_1(d)$.\n    -   We are given $m_1(d) = c$.\n    -   So, $m_1(m_3(a,a,a)) = -c$.\n\n2.  Compute the second term, $m_2(m_2(a,a),a)$:\n    -   First, evaluate the inner expression: $m_2(a,a) = b$.\n    -   The term becomes $m_2(b,a)$.\n    -   We are given $m_2(b,a) = c$.\n    -   So, $m_2(m_2(a,a),a) = c$.\n\n3.  Compute the third term, $-m_2(a,m_2(a,a))$:\n    -   First, evaluate the inner expression: $m_2(a,a) = b$.\n    -   The term becomes $-m_2(a,b)$.\n    -   We are given $m_2(a,b) = 0$.\n    -   So, $-m_2(a,m_2(a,a)) = -0 = 0$.\n\nCombining the results for the three terms:\n$$\nS = (-c) + (c) - (0) = 0\n$$\nThe direct calculation confirms the result obtained from the structural identity of the A$\\infty$ algebra. The specific values provided for the operations $m_k$ constitute a valid local description of an A$\\infty$ structure. The result is the zero element of the algebra, which corresponds to the real number $0$.",

Since $x$ is a coordinate on the torus, we can take its representative in the interval $[0,1)$. Let $\\{ \\cdot \\}$ denote the fractional part of a real number. Then the unique solution for $x$ in $[0,1)$ is $x = \\{-\\alpha\\} = 1 - \\{\\alpha\\}$ since $\\alpha$ is irrational. The corresponding $y$ coordinate is $y \\equiv 0 \\ \\text{mod } 1$, so we can take $y=0$. Thus, there is exactly one intersection point $p = (\\{-\\alpha\\}, 0)$. The irrationality of $\\alpha$ is crucial for the uniqueness of this intersection point.\n\nNext, we compute the Maslov index of the intersection point $p$. The problem states that the canonical bundle of $T^{2}$ is trivialized by $dz = dx + i dy$, and the Maslov index is computed from the relative angles of tangent vectors. The tangent space $T_p L_{0}$ is spanned by the vector $t_{0}=(1,0)$, which corresponds to the real axis in $\\mathbb{C}$. We can assign to $L_0$ a constant phase function $\\theta_{0}(x) = 0$. The tangent space $T_p L_{1}$ is spanned by the vector $t_{1}=(1,1)$, which corresponds to the line at an angle of $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ with the positive real axis. We can assign to $L_1$ a constant phase function $\\theta_{1}(x) = \\frac{1}{4}$ (angle in units of $\\pi$). The degree of the intersection point $p$ is given by the Maslov index, which can be computed as\n$$\\mu(p) = \\text{round}(\\theta_{1}(p) - \\theta_{0}(p)) = \\text{round}\\left(\\frac{1}{4} - 0\\right) = 0$$\nThus, the Floer chain complex $CF^{\\bullet}(L_{0},u_{0};L_{1},u_{1})$, which is generated by the intersection points, has a single generator $p$ in degree $0$. Over the Novikov field $\\Lambda$, the complex is\n$$CF^{k}(L_{0},u_{0};L_{1},u_{1}) = \\begin{cases} \\Lambda \\cdot p  k=0 \\\\ 0  k \\neq 0 \\end{cases}$$\n\nThe second task is to determine if the Floer differential, $m_{1}: CF^k \\to CF^{k+1}$, vanishes. The differential is of degree $+1$. Since the chain complex is concentrated in degree $0$, any such map must be zero. For instance, $m_{1}: CF^{0} \\to CF^{1}$ must be the zero map because the target space $CF^{1}$ is trivial. Similarly for all other degrees.\n\nThe problem asks for an argument based on the geometry of $J$-holomorphic strips. The differential coefficient $\\langle m_{1}(p), q \\rangle$ is defined by a weighted count of rigid $J$-holomorphic strips $u: \\mathbb{R} \\times [0,1] \\to T^{2}$ with boundary conditions $u(s,0) \\in L_{0}$ and $u(s,1) \\in L_{1}$, and asymptotic limits $\\lim_{s \\to -\\infty} u(s,t) = p$ and $\\lim_{s \\to +\\infty} u(s,t) = q$. For a strip to be rigid (i.e., belonging to a $0$-dimensional moduli space), its Maslov index must be $1$. This index is given by $\\mu(q) - \\mu(p)$.\nIn our case, since there is only one intersection point $p$, any strip must connect $p$ to itself, so $p=q$. The Maslov index of such a strip must be $\\mu(p) - \\mu(p) = 0$. Since $0 \\neq 1$, there are no rigid $J$-holomorphic strips from $p$ to $p$. Consequently, the count of such strips is zero, and the differential $m_{1}$ vanishes identically.\n\nMore directly, for the standard complex structure $J$ on $T^2$, a $J$-holomorphic map $u(s,t) = (u_x, u_y)$ from the strip $\\mathbb{R} \\times [0,1]$ to $\\mathbb{R}^2$ must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations: $\\partial_s u_x = \\partial_t u_y$ and $\\partial_s u_y = -\\partial_t u_x$.\nThe boundary conditions are that for any $s \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $u(s,0)$ lies on a lift of $L_0$ and $u(s,1)$ lies on a lift of $L_1$. Let's choose the lifts to be $\\tilde{L}_0: y=k_0$ and $\\tilde{L}_1: y=x+k_1+\\alpha$ for some integers $k_0, k_1$.\nThe boundary condition $u(s,0) \\in \\tilde{L}_0$ implies $u_y(s,0) = k_0$ for all $s$. Since $u_y$ is harmonic on the strip, it must be a linear function of $t$, i.e., $u_y(s,t) = at+b$. The condition at $t=0$ gives $b=k_0$. So $u_y(s,t) = at+k_0$.\nFrom the Cauchy-Riemann equations, $\\partial_t u_x = -\\partial_s u_y = 0$, so $u_x$ is independent of $t$; $u_x(s,t)=f(s)$. Then $\\partial_s u_x = f'(s) = \\partial_t u_y = a$. This implies $f(s) = as+c$ for some constant $c$.\nSo, any such holomorphic map must be of the form $u(s,t) = (as+c, at+k_0)$.\nThe second boundary condition is $u(s,1) \\in \\tilde{L}_1$, which means $u_y(s,1) = u_x(s,1) + k_1 + \\alpha$.\nSubstituting our solution, we get $a(1)+k_0 = (as+c) + k_1 + \\alpha$.\n$$a+k_0 = as + c + k_1 + \\alpha$$\nThis equation must hold for all $s \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This is only possible if the coefficient of $s$ is zero, which means $a=0$. If $a=0$, the map is constant: $u(s,t)=(c,k_0)$. Constant maps are trivial and do not contribute to the differential $m_1$. Thus, there are no non-constant $J$-holomorphic strips, confirming that $m_{1} \\equiv 0$. Since there are no strips to count, the holonomy factors $u_0, u_1$ and symplectic area terms are inconsequential to the final result of the differential being zero.\n\nThe third task is to compute the Floer cohomology $HF^{\\bullet}(L_{0},u_{0};L_{1},u_{1})$. It is defined as the cohomology of the Floer complex, $HF^{\\bullet} = \\ker(m_{1}) / \\text{im}(m_{1})$. Since $m_{1} \\equiv 0$, we have $\\ker(m_{1}) = CF^{\\bullet}$ and $\\text{im}(m_{1}) = 0$. Therefore, the Floer cohomology is isomorphic to the chain complex itself:\n$$HF^{\\bullet}(L_{0},u_{0};L_{1},u_{1}) \\cong CF^{\\bullet}(L_{0},u_{0};L_{1},u_{1})$$\nThis yields\n$$HF^{k}(L_{0},u_{0};L_{1},u_{1}) = \\begin{cases} \\Lambda \\cdot [p]  k=0 \\\\ 0  k \\neq 0 \\end{cases}$$\nThe dimension of the Floer cohomology is $\\dim HF^0 = 1$, and $\\dim HF^k = 0$ for all $k \\neq 0$.\n\nFinally, the Poincaré polynomial $P(q)$ is given by the sum of the dimensions of the graded cohomology groups:\n$$P(q) = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\dim HF^{k}(L_{0},u_{0};L_{1},u_{1}) \\, q^{k}$$\nSubstituting the dimensions we found:\n$$P(q) = (\\dim HF^0) \\cdot q^0 = 1 \\cdot q^0 = 1$$",
