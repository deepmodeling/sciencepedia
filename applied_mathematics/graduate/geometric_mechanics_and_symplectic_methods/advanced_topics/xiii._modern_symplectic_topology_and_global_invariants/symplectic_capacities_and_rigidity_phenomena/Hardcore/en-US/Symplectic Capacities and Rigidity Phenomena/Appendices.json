            "problem": "Consider the open unit ball $B^{2n}(1) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ equipped with the standard symplectic form $\\omega_0$, where $\\omega_0$ is defined by $\\omega_0 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} dx_i \\wedge dy_i$ in the canonical coordinates $(x_1,y_1,\\dots,x_n,y_n)$. Work in the following framework.\n\nFundamental definitions and facts to be used:\n- A symplectic form $\\omega$ on a smooth manifold is a closed, non-degenerate $2$-form. It is called exact if there exists a $1$-form $\\lambda$ such that $d\\lambda = \\omega$.\n- Given an exact symplectic form $\\omega = d\\lambda$, the vector field $Y$ defined by the identity $\\iota_Y \\omega = \\lambda$ is called a Liouville vector field. A hypersurface is of contact type if the Liouville vector field is everywhere transverse to it; in that case, $\\alpha := \\lambda|_{\\Sigma}$ is a contact form on the hypersurface $\\Sigma$.\n- For a contact form $\\alpha$ on a $(2n-1)$-dimensional manifold, the Reeb vector field $R$ is uniquely determined by $\\alpha(R) = 1$ and $d\\alpha(R,\\cdot) = 0$.\n- The first Ekeland-Hofer capacity (EHC), written as $c_{\\mathrm{EH}}^{1}$, of a compact, star-shaped domain in $(\\mathbb{R}^{2n},\\omega_0)$ can be computed as the minimal action of closed characteristics on its boundary when the boundary is of contact type.

Using only these coordinates and the definition of the exterior derivative, construct a $1$-form $\\lambda$ on $B^{2n}(1)$ such that $d\\lambda = \\omega_0$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It presents a standard, multi-step exercise in symplectic geometry and is therefore deemed valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\n**Task 1: Construction of the 1-form $\\lambda$**\n\nWe begin by expressing the standard symplectic form $\\omega_0 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} dx_i \\wedge dy_i$ in polar coordinates. The transformation is given by $x_i = r_i \\cos(\\theta_i)$ and $y_i = r_i \\sin(\\theta_i)$ for each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. We compute the differentials:\n$$dx_i = \\cos(\\theta_i) dr_i - r_i \\sin(\\theta_i) d\\theta_i$$\n$$dy_i = \\sin(\\theta_i) dr_i + r_i \\cos(\\theta_i) d\\theta_i$$\nNext, we compute the wedge product $dx_i \\wedge dy_i$:\n$$dx_i \\wedge dy_i = (\\cos(\\theta_i) dr_i - r_i \\sin(\\theta_i) d\\theta_i) \\wedge (\\sin(\\theta_i) dr_i + r_i \\cos(\\theta_i) d\\theta_i)$$\nUsing the properties of the exterior product, namely bilinearity and anti-commutativity ($dr_i \\wedge dr_i = 0$, $d\\theta_i \\wedge d\\theta_i=0$, and $d\\theta_i \\wedge dr_i = -dr_i \\wedge d\\theta_i$), we expand the expression:\n$$dx_i \\wedge dy_i = r_i \\cos^2(\\theta_i) (dr_i \\wedge d\\theta_i) - r_i \\sin^2(\\theta_i) (d\\theta_i \\wedge dr_i)$$\n$$dx_i \\wedge dy_i = r_i \\cos^2(\\theta_i) (dr_i \\wedge d\\theta_i) + r_i \\sin^2(\\theta_i) (dr_i \\wedge d\\theta_i)$$\n$$dx_i \\wedge dy_i = r_i (\\cos^2(\\theta_i) + \\sin^2(\\theta_i)) (dr_i \\wedge d\\theta_i) = r_i dr_i \\wedge d\\theta_i$$\nSumming over all $i$, the symplectic form in polar coordinates is:\n$$\\omega_0 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} r_i dr_i \\wedge d\\theta_i$$\nWe seek a $1$-form $\\lambda$ such that $d\\lambda = \\omega_0$. Let us propose a form $\\lambda = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i(r_1, \\dots, r_n) d\\theta_i$. A simpler ansatz is $\\lambda = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(r_i) d\\theta_i$. Its exterior derivative is:\n$$d\\lambda = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} d(f(r_i) d\\theta_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} df(r_i) \\wedge d\\theta_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial r_i} dr_i \\wedge d\\theta_i$$\nComparing this with $\\omega_0 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} r_i dr_i \\wedge d\\theta_i$, we require $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial r_i} = r_i$. Integrating with respect to $r_i$ gives $f(r_i) = \\frac{1}{2} r_i^2 + C$. We can choose the integration constant $C=0$. Thus, a suitable $1$-form is:\n$$\\lambda = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{2} r_i^2 d\\theta_i$$\nThis is the expression for $\\lambda$ in $(r_i, \\theta_i)$ coordinates.\n\nTo express $\\lambda$ in Cartesian coordinates $(x_i, y_i)$, we use the relations $r_i^2 = x_i^2 + y_i^2$ and $\\theta_i = \\arctan(y_i/x_i)$. The differential of $\\theta_i$ is:\n$$d\\theta_i = d\\left(\\arctan\\left(\\frac{y_i}{x_i}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{1}{1 + (y_i/x_i)^2} d\\left(\\frac{y_i}{x_i}\\right) = \\frac{x_i^2}{x_i^2 + y_i^2} \\left(\\frac{x_i dy_i - y_i dx_i}{x_i^2}\\right) = \\frac{x_i dy_i - y_i dx_i}{x_i^2 + y_i^2}$$\nSubstituting $r_i^2$ and $d\\theta_i$ into the expression for $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{2} (x_i^2 + y_i^2) \\left(\\frac{x_i dy_i - y_i dx_i}{x_i^2 + y_i^2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i dy_i - y_i dx_i)$$\nThis is the standard Liouville form on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$.\n\n**Task 2: Transversality of the Liouville vector field**\n\nThe Liouville vector field $Y$ is defined by the relation $\\iota_Y \\omega_0 = \\lambda$. Let $Y = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (A_j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} + B_j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_j})$. We compute $\\iota_Y \\omega_0$:\n$$\\iota_Y \\omega_0 = \\iota_Y \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{n} dx_k \\wedge dy_k\\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (A_j \\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j}} + B_j \\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_j}}) (dx_j \\wedge dy_j) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (A_j dy_j - B_j dx_j)$$\nEquating this with $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (x_j dy_j - y_j dx_j)$, we identify the components:\n$A_j = \\frac{1}{2} x_j$ and $B_j = \\frac{1}{2} y_j$.\nSo, the Liouville vector field is:\n$$Y = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(x_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} + y_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_i}\\right)$$\nThis is half the radial vector field, $Y = \\frac{1}{2} r \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}$. The boundary of the unit ball $B^{2n}(1)$ is the $(2n-1)$-sphere $S^{2n-1}$, which is the level set of the function $F(x_1, y_1, \\dots) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i^2 + y_i^2) - 1 = 0$. A vector field is transverse to a hypersurface if it is not tangent to it at any point. The vector field $Y$ is transverse if $dF(Y) \\neq 0$ on $S^{2n-1}$.\n$$dF(Y) = \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} 2x_j dx_j + 2y_j dy_j\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} + y_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_i}\\right)$$\n$$= \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \\left(2x_j dx_j(x_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}) + 2y_j dy_j(y_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_i})\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i^2 + y_i^2)$$\nOn the sphere $S^{2n-1}$, we have $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i^2 + y_i^2) = 1$. Since $dF(Y) = 1 \\neq 0$ everywhere on $S^{2n-1}$, the vector field $Y$ is transverse to the sphere. As stated in the problem's premises, because $Y$ is a Liouville vector field transverse to the hypersurface $S^{2n-1}$, it follows that $\\alpha := \\lambda|_{S^{2n-1}}$ defines a contact form on $S^{2n-1}$.\n\n**Task 3: Computation of the Reeb vector field and minimal period**\n\nThe Reeb vector field $R$ on the contact manifold $(S^{2n-1}, \\alpha)$ is uniquely determined by the conditions:\n1. $\\alpha(R) = 1$\n2. $\\iota_R d\\alpha = 0$\n\nSince $\\alpha = \\lambda|_{S^{2n-1}}$, its exterior derivative is $d\\alpha = (d\\lambda)|_{S^{2n-1}} = \\omega_0|_{S^{2n-1}}$. The second condition becomes $\\iota_R(\\omega_0|_{S^{2n-1}}) = 0$. This means $R$ must belong to the kernel of the restricted 2-form $\\omega_0|_{T S^{2n-1}}$.\nConsider the vector field $X = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (-y_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} + x_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_i})$. This vector field generates rotations in each $(x_i, y_i)$-plane. First, we verify that $X$ is tangent to $S^{2n-1}$.\n$$dF(X) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (2x_i dx_i(X) + 2y_i dy_i(X)) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (2x_i(-y_i) + 2y_i(x_i)) = 0$$\nSince $dF(X)=0$, $X$ is tangent to the level sets of $F$, so it is tangent to $S^{2n-1}$.\nNext, let's compute $\\iota_X \\omega_0$:\n$$\\iota_X \\omega_0 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\iota_X(dx_i \\wedge dy_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (dx_i(X)dy_i - dy_i(X)dx_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (-y_i dy_i - x_i dx_i) = -\\frac{1}{2} d\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i^2 + y_i^2)\\right)$$\nOn $S^{2n-1}$, $\\sum_i(x_i^2+y_i^2)=1$, so its differential restricted to the tangent space is zero. Thus, for any vector $W \\in T_pS^{2n-1}$, $\\omega_0(X_p, W) = (\\iota_X \\omega_0)_p(W) = 0$. This means $X$ is in the kernel of $\\omega_0|_{S^{2n-1}}$. The kernel is one-dimensional, so $R$ must be proportional to $X$, i.e., $R = cX$ for some constant $c$.\n\nWe use the first condition, $\\alpha(R)=1$, to find $c$.\n$$\\alpha(R) = c \\alpha(X) = c \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i dy_i - y_i dx_i)\\right)(X)$$\n$$= \\frac{c}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i dy_i(X) - y_i dx_i(X)) = \\frac{c}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i(x_i) - y_i(-y_i)) = \\frac{c}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i^2 + y_i^2)$$\nOn $S^{2n-1}$, this simplifies to $\\alpha(R) = \\frac{c}{2} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{c}{2}$. Setting this to $1$ gives $c=2$.\nThe Reeb vector field is $R = 2X = 2\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (-y_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} + x_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_i})$.\nThe integral curves, or orbits, of $R$ are solutions to the system of ODEs:\n$$\\frac{dx_i}{dt} = -2y_i \\quad, \\quad \\frac{dy_i}{dt} = 2x_i$$\nDifferentiating the first equation gives $\\frac{d^2 x_i}{dt^2} = -2\\frac{dy_i}{dt} = -2(2x_i) = -4x_i$. The equation of motion is $\\frac{d^2 x_i}{dt^2} + 4x_i = 0$. This is a simple harmonic oscillator with angular frequency $\\omega = \\sqrt{4} = 2$.\nThe period of oscillation is $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega} = \\frac{2\\pi}{2} = \\pi$.\nThe solutions are circles in each $(x_i, y_i)$ plane traced with this period. For a trajectory to be a closed orbit, all coordinates must return to their initial values simultaneously. Since the period is the same for all $i$, all orbits of the Reeb flow are periodic with minimal period $T_{\\min} = \\pi$.\n\n**Task 4: Computation of the first Ekeland-Hofer capacity**\n\nThe problem provides a characterization for the first Ekeland-Hofer capacity, $c_{\\mathrm{EH}}^{1}$, for a compact, star-shaped domain with a contact type boundary. It is the minimal action of closed characteristics on the boundary. For a contact boundary, these characteristics are the closed Reeb orbits.\nThe action of a closed orbit $\\gamma$ is given by $A(\\gamma) = \\int_{\\gamma} \\alpha$.\nFor a Reeb orbit $\\gamma(t)$ with period $T$, the integrand is $\\alpha_{\\gamma(t)}(\\dot{\\gamma}(t)) = \\alpha_{\\gamma(t)}(R_{\\gamma(t)})$. By definition of the Reeb vector field $R$, we have $\\alpha(R)=1$.\nTherefore, the action simplifies to the period of the orbit:\n$$A(\\gamma) = \\int_0^T \\alpha(R) dt = \\int_0^T 1 \\, dt = T$$\nThe capacity $c_{\\mathrm{EH}}^{1}$ is the minimum of these actions over all closed Reeb orbits. Since all closed Reeb orbits on $S^{2n-1}$ have the same minimal period $T_{\\min} = \\pi$, the minimal action is $\\pi$.\nThus, the first Ekeland-Hofer capacity of the open unit ball is:\n$$c_{\\mathrm{EH}}^{1}\\!\\left(B^{2n}(1),\\omega_0\\right) = \\pi$$",

We may proceed with the solution. The solution will be derived in two main steps: first establishing a lower bound for $e(B^{2n}(R))$, and then an upper bound.\n\nFirst, we establish a lower bound for $e(B^{2n}(R))$. A fundamental result in the theory of symplectic capacities is that the Gromov width is a lower bound for the displacement energy for any subset $U \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, that is, $c_G(U) \\le e(U)$. This inequality is a deep consequence of the principles underlying Gromov's nonsqueezing theorem and the properties of the Hofer length, often demonstrated using techniques from Floer theory or the theory of generating functions. Assuming this standard property, we can find a lower bound for $e(B^{2n}(R))$ by computing $c_G(B^{2n}(R))$.\n\nBy its definition, the Gromov width of $B^{2n}(R)$ is the supremum of the areas $\\pi r^2$ of balls $B^{2n}(r)$ that can be symplectically embedded into $B^{2n}(R)$. Consider the identity map $\\mathrm{id}: \\mathbb{R}^{2n} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. Its restriction to any open ball $B^{2n}(r)$ is a symplectic embedding. For the image $\\mathrm{id}(B^{2n}(r)) = B^{2n}(r)$ to be a subset of $B^{2n}(R)$, we must have $r \\le R$. The largest possible value for $r$ is $R$, which corresponds to the identity embedding of $B^{2n}(R)$ into itself. Therefore, the set of possible values for $\\pi r^2$ is the interval $[0, \\pi R^2]$. The supremum is:\n$$\nc_G(B^{2n}(R)) = \\sup\\{\\pi r^2 \\mid r \\le R\\} = \\pi R^2.\n$$\nUsing the inequality $c_G(U) \\le e(U)$ for $U = B^{2n}(R)$, we obtain the lower bound:\n$$\ne(B^{2n}(R)) \\ge c_G(B^{2n}(R)) = \\pi R^2.\n$$\n\nNext, we establish an upper bound for $e(B^{2n}(R))$. By the definition of displacement energy, this requires finding a specific Hamiltonian that displaces $B^{2n}(R)$ from itself and calculating its Hofer length. A powerful result, originally due to Hofer and Zehnder and extended by others, states that for a bounded convex domain $U \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, its displacement energy $e(U)$ is equal to the Hofer-Zehnder capacity $c_{\\mathrm{HZ}}(U)$. The Hofer-Zehnder capacity is defined as the infimum of actions of closed characteristics on the boundary $\\partial U$. Since $B^{2n}(R)$ is a convex domain, we can apply this theorem.\n\nThe boundary of $B^{2n}(R)$ is the sphere $\\partial B^{2n}(R) = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2n} \\mid \\|z\\|^2 = R^2\\}$, where $\\|z\\|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n (q_i^2+p_i^2)$. A closed characteristic on this boundary is a periodic orbit of a Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ on a level set of that Hamiltonian $H$. We can choose a Hamiltonian for which $\\partial B^{2n}(R)$ is a regular energy level, for example $H(z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|z\\|^2$. The Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ is given by the relation $i_{X_H}\\omega_0 = \\mathrm{d}H$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}H = \\sum_{i=1}^n (q_i \\mathrm{d}q_i + p_i \\mathrm{d}p_i).\n$$\nThis gives the vector field:\n$$\nX_H = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_i} - \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q_i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_i}\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(p_i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_i} - q_i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_i}\\right).\n$$\nThe Hamiltonian equations of motion are $\\dot{q}_i = p_i$ and $\\dot{p}_i = -q_i$. The solution with initial condition $(q(0), p(0))$ is a rotation in each $(q_i, p_i)$-plane:\n$$\nq_i(t) = q_i(0)\\cos(t) + p_i(0)\\sin(t),\n$$\n$$\np_i(t) = -q_i(0)\\sin(t) + p_i(0)\\cos(t).\n$$\nAll orbits of this flow are periodic with period $T = 2\\pi$. A closed characteristic $\\gamma$ on the boundary $\\partial B^{2n}(R)$ is such an orbit with initial condition $\\gamma(0)$ on the sphere of radius $R$.\n\nThe action of a closed orbit $\\gamma(t)$ from $t=0$ to $t=T$ is given by the integral of the canonical one-form $\\lambda = \\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \\mathrm{d}q_i$ along the orbit:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}(\\gamma) = \\int_\\gamma \\lambda = \\int_0^T \\sum_{i=1}^n p_i(t) \\dot{q}_i(t) \\mathrm{d}t.\n$$\nSince $\\dot{q}_i(t) = p_i(t)$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}(\\gamma) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sum_{i=1}^n p_i(t)^2 \\mathrm{d}t.\n$$\nFor an orbit on the sphere of radius $R$, we have $\\sum_{i=1}^n (q_i(t)^2 + p_i(t)^2) = R^2$ for all $t$. Due to the rotational symmetry of the flow, the sum of squared momenta integrated over a period is equal to the sum of squared positions integrated over the same period. Specifically, $\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sum p_i^2 \\mathrm{d}t = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sum q_i^2 \\mathrm{d}t$. Therefore:\n$$\n2 \\mathcal{A}(\\gamma) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sum_{i=1}^n (q_i(t)^2 + p_i(t)^2) \\mathrm{d}t = \\int_0^{2\\pi} R^2 \\mathrm{d}t = 2\\pi R^2.\n$$\nThus, the action of any such closed characteristic is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}(\\gamma) = \\pi R^2.\n$$\nSince all closed characteristics on the boundary have the same action, the minimal action is $\\pi R^2$. By the theorem relating displacement energy to the Hofer-Zehnder capacity for convex sets, we have:\n$$\ne(B^{2n}(R)) = c_{\\mathrm{HZ}}(B^{2n}(R)) = \\pi R^2.\n$$\nThis provides the matching upper bound $e(B^{2n}(R)) \\le \\pi R^2$.\n\nCombining the lower and upper bounds, we conclude that the displacement energy of the ball is precisely:\n$$\ne(B^{2n}(R)) = \\pi R^2.\n$$\n\nFinally, we must verify that $c_G(B^{2n}(R)) \\le e(B^{2n}(R))$. Substituting the values we computed:\n$$\n\\pi R^2 \\le \\pi R^2.\n$$\nThis inequality holds true, as the two quantities are in fact equal. This equality between the Gromov width and the displacement energy for balls is a classic result in symplectic rigidity.",

The central principle is monotonicity: if one domain symplectically embeds into another, then every capacity of the first domain must be less than or equal to the corresponding capacity of the second. This exercise challenges you to use the entire infinite sequence of Embedded Contact Homology (ECH) capacities to find the optimal embedding of a polydisk into an ellipsoid, a classic problem that demonstrates how these invariants can provide surprisingly sharp obstructions that go far beyond simple volume considerations.

Embedded Contact Homology (ECH) capacities form a nondecreasing sequence $\\{c_{k}(X)\\}_{k\\geq 0}$ attached to a symplectic $4$-manifold $X$ with contact type boundary, with $c_{0}(X)=0$, which are monotone under symplectic embeddings and scale linearly under dilation.\n\nConsider a symplectic embedding $P(1,2)\\hookrightarrow E(R,S)$. Starting only from the fundamental properties of symplectic volume monotonicity and the core definitions and facts about ECH capacities (monotonicity under embeddings and linear scaling), do the following:\n\n1. Compute, in closed form, the ECH capacities of $P(1,2)$ as a function of the index $k\\geq 0$, and list the first ten nonzero values explicitly.\n\n2. Express the ECH capacities of $E(R,S)$ in terms of $R$ and $S$ via a canonical indexing by lattice points, and write explicit formulas for $c_{1}(E(R,S))$, $c_{2}(E(R,S))$, $c_{3}(E(R,S))$, and $c_{4}(E(R,S))$ assuming $R\\leq S$.\n\n3.

Provide this pair $(R,S)$ as your final answer.\n\nYour final answer must be given as a two-entry row matrix and must be exact (no rounding). No units are required.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the unique pair $(R,S)$ with $R\\leq S$ that minimizes $S$, subject to the condition that the polydisk $P(1,2)$ symplectically embeds into the ellipsoid $E(R,S)$. The constraints arise from the monotonicity of symplectic volume and Embedded Contact Homology (ECH) capacities.\n\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed question in symplectic geometry, grounded in established principles and definitions (ECH capacities, symplectic embeddings). All terms are defined formally and objectively.\n\nWe will follow the four steps outlined in the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: ECH Capacities of the Polydisk $P(1,2)$\n\nThe ECH capacities of a four-dimensional convex toric domain defined by $\\{(z_1, z_2) \\in \\mathbb{C}^2 \\mid (\\pi|z_1|^2, \\pi|z_2|^2) \\in \\Omega\\}$ are given by a specific recipe. For a polydisk $P(a,b)$, corresponding to the rectangular region $\\Omega = [0,a]\\times[0,b]$, the capacities $\\{c_k(P(a,b))\\}_{k\\geq 1}$ are the ordered values (with multiplicity) of the set $\\{ma+nb \\mid (m,n) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}\\}$.\n\nFor the polydisk $P(1,2)$, the capacities are the ordered values of the set $\\{m\\cdot 1 + n\\cdot 2 \\mid (m,n) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}\\}$. While a simple closed-form expression for $c_k$ as a direct function of $k$ is complex to derive, the set of values is well-defined and can be computed algorithmically. We list the first few values by finding the smallest sums $m+2n$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $m=1, n=0 \\implies 1$. This is the smallest value.\n    \\item $m=2, n=0 \\implies 2$.\n    \\item $m=0, n=1 \\implies 2$.\n    \\item $m=3, n=0 \\implies 3$.\n    \\item $m=1, n=1 \\implies 3$.\n    \\item $m=4, n=0 \\implies 4$.\n    \\item $m=2, n=1 \\implies 4$.\n    \\item $m=0, n=2 \\implies 4$.\n    \\item $m=5, n=0 \\implies 5$.\n    \\item $m=3, n=1 \\implies 5$.\n\\end{itemize}\nOrdering these values gives the sequence of ECH capacities. The first ten nonzero capacities of $P(1,2)$ are:\n$c_1(P(1,2)) = 1$\n$c_2(P(1,2)) = 2$\n$c_3(P(1,2)) = 2$\n$c_4(P(1,2)) = 3$\n$c_5(P(1,2)) = 3$\n$c_6(P(1,2)) = 4$\n$c_7(P(1,2)) = 4$\n$c_8(P(1,2)) = 4$\n$c_9(P(1,2)) = 5$\n$c_{10}(P(1,2)) = 5$\n\n### Step 2: ECH Capacities of the Ellipsoid $E(R,S)$\n\nFor an ellipsoid $E(R,S)$, corresponding to the triangular region $\\Omega = \\{(x,y) \\mid x,y\\ge 0, x/R+y/S \\le 1\\}$, the ECH capacities $\\{c_k(E(R,S))\\}_{k\\geq 1}$ are similarly given by the ordered values (with multiplicity) of the set $\\{mR+nS \\mid (m,n) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}\\}$.\n\nWith the assumption $R\\leq S$, the first few capacities can be determined by ordering the smallest values in this set. The smallest values will be generated by pairs $(m,n)$ with small $m$ and $n$. The candidates are $R$ (from $(1,0)$), $2R$ (from $(2,0)$), $S$ (from $(0,1)$), $3R$ (from $(3,0)$), $R+S$ (from $(1,1)$), etc.\n\n$c_1(E(R,S))$: The smallest value is from $(1,0)$, giving $R$. Thus, $c_1(E(R,S)) = R$.\n\n$c_2(E(R,S))$: The next smallest value is either $2R$ (from $(2,0)$) or $S$ (from $(0,1)$). Thus, $c_2(E(R,S)) = \\min(2R, S)$.\n\n$c_3(E(R,S))$: The third value in the ordered list depends on the ordering of $\\{R, 2R, S\\}$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item If $S  2R$, the ordered values start with $R, S, 2R, \\ldots$. So $c_3(E(R,S)) = 2R$.\n    \\item If $S = 2R$, the values start with $R, 2R, 2R, \\ldots$ (from $(2,0)$ and $(0,1)$). So $c_3(E(R,S)) = 2R$.\n    \\item If $S  2R$, the values start with $R, 2R, \\ldots$. The third value is $\\min(S, 3R)$. So $c_3(E(R,S)) = \\min(S, 3R)$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n$c_4(E(R,S))$: The fourth capacity is the next in the sequence. Again, this depends on the ratio $S/R$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item If $S  2R$, the first three are $R, S, 2R$. The next candidate value is $\\min(3R, R+S)$. Since $S2R \\implies R+S  3R$, we have $c_4(E(R,S))=R+S$.\n    \\item If $S = 2R$, the values are $R, 2R, 2R, \\ldots$. The next value is $3R$. So $c_4(E(R,S)) = 3R$.\n    \\item If $S  2R$, the first values are $R, 2R, \\min(S,3R), \\ldots$. The fourth capacity is more complex, e.g., if $S  3R$, the sequence starts $R, 2R, S, 3R, \\ldots$ so $c_4 = 3R$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n### Step 3: Symplectic Volume and Capacity Inequalities\n\nA symplectic embedding $P(1,2) \\hookrightarrow E(R,S)$ imposes constraints on $R$ and $S$.\n\nFirst, the symplectic volume of the domain must be less than or equal to the symplectic volume of the target. The symplectic volume of a region $X \\subset \\mathbb{R}^4$ is given by $\\text{Vol}(X) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_X \\omega_0 \\wedge \\omega_0 = \\int_X dx_1 \\wedge dy_1 \\wedge dx_2 \\wedge dy_2$.\nFor the polydisk $P(a,b)$, which is a product of two disks of areas $a$ and $b$, the volume is $\\text{Vol}(P(a,b)) = ab$. Thus, $\\text{Vol}(P(1,2)) = 1 \\cdot 2 = 2$.\nFor the ellipsoid $E(R,S)$, the volume is $\\text{Vol}(E(R,S)) = \\frac{1}{2}RS$.\nThe volume obstruction is $\\text{Vol}(P(1,2)) \\le \\text{Vol}(E(R,S))$, which implies $2 \\le \\frac{1}{2}RS$, or $RS \\ge 4$.\n\nSecond, by the monotonicity property of ECH capacities, we have an infinite family of inequalities:\n$$c_k(P(1,2)) \\le c_k(E(R,S)) \\quad \\text{for all } k \\ge 1.$$\nThe first few inequalities are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $k=1: c_1(P(1,2)) = 1 \\le c_1(E(R,S)) = R$. So, $R \\ge 1$.\n    \\item $k=2: c_2(P(1,2)) = 2 \\le c_2(E(R,S)) = \\min(2R, S)$. This implies $2R \\ge 2$ (or $R \\ge 1$) and $S \\ge 2$.\n    \\item $k=3: c_3(P(1,2)) = 2 \\le c_3(E(R,S))$.\n    \\item $k=4: c_4(P(1,2)) = 3 \\le c_4(E(R,S))$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe condition $S \\ge 2$ is the strongest initial constraint on $S$.\n\n### Step 4: Minimization of S\n\nWe want to find the pair $(R,S)$ that minimizes $S$ subject to the constraints:\n1. $R \\le S$ (given)\n2. $RS \\ge 4$ (volume obstruction)\n3. $c_k(P(1,2)) \\le c_k(E(R,S))$ for all $k \\ge 1$.\n\nFrom Step 3, the second capacity inequality $c_2(P(1,2)) \\le c_2(E(R,S))$ requires $S \\ge 2$. This establishes a lower bound on the value we are trying to minimize. The minimum possible value for $S$ is $2$.\n\nLet's test if $S=2$ is achievable. If $S=2$, the constraint $R \\le S$ implies $R \\le 2$. The volume constraint $RS \\ge 4$ implies $2R \\ge 4$, so $R \\ge 2$. Together, these force $R=2$.\nSo, if a valid embedding exists, the only possible pair $(R,S)$ that minimizes $S$ is $(2,2)$. We must now verify if the pair $(R,S)=(2,2)$ satisfies all the ECH capacity inequalities.\n\nWe need to check if $c_k(P(1,2)) \\le c_k(E(2,2))$ for all $k \\ge 1$. This is equivalent to checking if the counting function for capacities is ordered correctly. Let $N_X(v) = \\#\\{k \\ge 1 \\mid c_k(X) \\le v\\}$ be the number of capacities of a domain $X$ less than or equal to a value $v$. The condition $c_k(P(1,2)) \\le c_k(E(2,2))$ for all $k$ is equivalent to $N_{P(1,2)}(v) \\ge N_{E(2,2)}(v)$ for all $v \\ge 0$.\n\nFor $P(1,2)$, the capacities are values $m+2n$. The number of capacities up to $v$ is:\n$$N_{P(1,2)}(v) = \\#\\{(m,n) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\} \\mid m+2n \\le v \\}$$\nFor $E(2,2)$, the capacities are values $2m+2n = 2(m+n)$. The number of capacities up to $v$ is:\n$$N_{E(2,2)}(v) = \\#\\{(m,n) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\} \\mid 2(m+n) \\le v \\} = \\#\\{ \\dots \\mid m+n \\le v/2 \\}$$\nLet $|S_X(v)| = \\#\\{(m,n) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}^2 \\mid \\text{condition for } v \\}$, which includes the origin. Then $N_X(v) = |S_X(v)|-1$. We need to show $|S_{P(1,2)}(v)| \\ge |S_{E(2,2)}(v)|$ for any integer $v \\ge 0$.\nLet $q = \\lfloor v/2 \\rfloor$.\nThe number of non-negative integer solutions to $m+n \\le q$ is $|S_{E(2,2)}(v)| = \\frac{(q+1)(q+2)}{2}$. This is a standard combinatorial result.\nFor $P(1,2)$, we need to count points for $m+2n \\le v$.\n$|S_{P(1,2)}(v)| = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\lfloor v/2 \\rfloor} (\\lfloor v-2n \\rfloor + 1) = \\sum_{n=0}^{q} (\\lfloor (2q+r)-2n \\rfloor + 1) = \\sum_{n=0}^{q} (2q-2n+r + 1)$, where $v=2q+r$ and $r \\in \\{0,1\\}$. A known identity for the area of the corresponding polygon gives approximately $(v^2/4 + v/2 + 1)$. The exact count for integer $v$ is $|S_{P(1,2)}(v)| = (q+1)(v+1-q)$.\nWe need to prove $(q+1)(v+1-q) \\ge \\frac{(q+1)(q+2)}{2}$.\nSince $q \\ge 0$ for $v \\ge 0$, we can divide by $q+1$ (if $q=-1$, inequality holds trivially):\n$$ v+1-q \\ge \\frac{q+2}{2} $$\n$$ 2v+2-2q \\ge q+2 $$\n$$ 2v \\ge 3q $$\nWe know $v \\ge 2q$ since $q=\\lfloor v/2 \\rfloor$. As $q \\ge 0$, $v \\ge 2q \\ge 1.5q = \\frac{3}{2}q$. The inequality holds.\nThis confirms that $N_{P(1,2)}(v) \\ge N_{E(2,2)}(v)$ for all $v \\ge 0$. Therefore, all the ECH capacity inequalities are satisfied for the pair $(R,S)=(2,2)$.\n\nSince $S \\ge 2$ is a necessary condition, the minimum value for $S$ is $2$. The pair $(R,S)=(2,2)$ achieves this minimum and satisfies all constraints. Furthermore, any solution $(R',S')$ with $S'=2$ must satisfy $R' \\le 2$ (by problem assumption) and $R'S' \\ge 4 \\implies 2R' \\ge 4 \\implies R' \\ge 2$. This forces $R'=2$.\nTherefore, $(2,2)$ is the unique pair that minimizes $S$.",
