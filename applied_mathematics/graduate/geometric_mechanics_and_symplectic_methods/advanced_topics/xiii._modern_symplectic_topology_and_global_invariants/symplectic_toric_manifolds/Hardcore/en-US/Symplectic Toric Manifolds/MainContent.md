## Introduction
Symplectic toric manifolds represent a remarkable confluence of differential geometry, algebraic topology, and combinatorics. They are spaces that, despite their geometric complexity, can be completely described by simple, discrete objects: convex [polytopes](@entry_id:635589). This powerful connection provides a "toy model" that is both rich enough to exhibit deep geometric phenomena and simple enough to be completely computable, making it an invaluable tool across modern mathematics and theoretical physics. The significance of these manifolds lies in their ability to translate difficult questions about geometry and topology into [tractable problems](@entry_id:269211) involving [lattice points](@entry_id:161785) and face structures.

This article provides a comprehensive exploration of this beautiful theory. It addresses the central problem of how to classify and analyze these manifolds by systematically developing the dictionary that connects them to their combinatorial counterparts. By understanding this correspondence, we can unlock a powerful computational toolkit for investigating geometric structures that appear in fields ranging from algebraic geometry to string theory.

The journey is structured across three chapters. The first, **"Principles and Mechanisms,"** lays the foundation by introducing Hamiltonian torus actions, the momentum map, and the properties of the resulting Delzant polytope, culminating in the celebrated Delzant classification theorem. The second chapter, **"Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections,"** demonstrates the power of this framework by showing how to compute [topological invariants](@entry_id:138526), analyze [canonical metrics](@entry_id:266957), and connect with profound ideas in mathematical physics like [geometric quantization](@entry_id:159174) and [mirror symmetry](@entry_id:158730), all from the polytope. Finally, **"Hands-On Practices"** offers a series of guided problems to solidify these concepts and build practical skills in applying the theory.

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter delves into the fundamental principles and mechanisms that govern the structure of symplectic toric manifolds. We will explore how the geometry of a Hamiltonian torus action is intricately encoded in the [combinatorics](@entry_id:144343) of a [convex polytope](@entry_id:1123046), a connection that culminates in a powerful classification theorem. We will begin by examining the local structure of the action, then build up to the global picture, and finally, demonstrate how to construct these manifolds and compute their [geometric invariants](@entry_id:178611) directly from their combinatorial data.

### The Geometry of Hamiltonian Torus Actions

A **[symplectic toric manifold](@entry_id:1132761)** is formally defined as a connected, compact symplectic manifold $(M, \omega)$ of dimension $2n$ that is equipped with an effective Hamiltonian action of the $n$-dimensional torus, $T^n = (\mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z})^n$. The effectiveness of the action ensures that no element of the torus other than the identity acts trivially on the entire manifold. The Hamiltonian nature of the action is captured by a **momentum map** $\mu: M \to \mathfrak{t}^*$, where $\mathfrak{t}^*$ is the dual of the Lie algebra of $T^n$, which we identify with $\mathbb{R}^n$. This map satisfies the defining relation $d\langle\mu, \xi\rangle = \iota_{X_\xi}\omega$ for every $\xi \in \mathfrak{t}$, where $X_\xi$ is the fundamental vector field generated by $\xi$. A key simplification for [abelian groups](@entry_id:145145) like the torus is that the coadjoint action on $\mathfrak{t}^*$ is trivial, so the [equivariance](@entry_id:636671) condition on the momentum map, $\mu(g \cdot p) = \text{Ad}_g^*(\mu(p))$, reduces to simple invariance: $\mu(g \cdot p) = \mu(p)$ for all $g \in T^n$ and $p \in M$. This means that the momentum map is constant along the orbits of the torus action .

This simple invariance property has profound consequences for the structure of the manifold, which can be understood by examining the level sets, or fibers, of the momentum map.

#### Fibers of the Momentum Map: Lagrangian Tori

Let us consider the [preimage](@entry_id:150899) $\mu^{-1}(x)$ for some point $x \in \mathfrak{t}^*$ that lies in the interior of the momentum image $\mu(M)$. A foundational result by Atiyah, Guillemin, and Sternberg states that for such a "regular" value $x$, the [stabilizer subgroup](@entry_id:137216) of any point $p \in \mu^{-1}(x)$ is trivial. Consequently, the orbit through $p$, $O_p = T^n \cdot p$, is diffeomorphic to the torus $T^n$ itself. Since the momentum map is constant on orbits, this entire orbit lies within the fiber $\mu^{-1}(x)$. In fact, for toric manifolds, such a fiber consists of precisely one such orbit. Therefore, the fiber $L_x = \mu^{-1}(x)$ is a smooth [submanifold](@entry_id:262388) of $M$ diffeomorphic to an $n$-dimensional torus.

These fibers possess a crucial symplectic property: they are **Lagrangian [submanifolds](@entry_id:159439)**. A submanifold is Lagrangian if the symplectic form vanishes on its [tangent space](@entry_id:141028) and its dimension is half that of the ambient manifold. The dimension of $L_x \cong T^n$ is $n$, which is indeed half the dimension of $M^{2n}$. To see that $\omega$ vanishes on $T_p L_x$, recall that the [tangent space](@entry_id:141028) to the orbit $L_x$ at a point $p$ is spanned by the fundamental vector fields: $T_p L_x = \{X_\xi(p) \mid \xi \in \mathfrak{t}\}$. Let $u = X_\xi(p)$ and $v = X_\eta(p)$ be two [tangent vectors](@entry_id:265494) to $L_x$ at $p$. Using the defining property of the momentum map, we can compute:
$$ \omega_p(u, v) = \omega_p(X_\xi(p), X_\eta(p)) = (\iota_{X_\xi}\omega)_p(X_\eta(p)) = (d\langle\mu, \xi\rangle)_p(X_\eta(p)) $$
Since $L_x$ is a level set of $\mu$, the function $\langle\mu, \xi\rangle$ is constant on $L_x$. Its differential must therefore annihilate any vector tangent to $L_x$, including $X_\eta(p)$. Thus, $(d\langle\mu, \xi\rangle)_p(X_\eta(p)) = 0$, which implies $\omega_p(u,v) = 0$. This establishes that the fibers of the [moment map](@entry_id:157938) over [regular values](@entry_id:161151) are Lagrangian tori .

#### Fixed Points and Isotropy Weights

The points in $M$ that are fixed by the entire torus action are of paramount importance. By the Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg [convexity](@entry_id:138568) theorem, the images of these fixed points under $\mu$ are precisely the vertices of the polytope $\mu(M)$. The local geometry of the manifold and the action around a fixed point $p \in M$ is described by the **[isotropy representation](@entry_id:184529)**. This is the induced linear action of $T^n$ on the tangent space $T_p M$.

Because the $T^n$-action is symplectic, this representation preserves the symplectic form $\omega_p$ on $T_pM$. As $T^n$ is compact, it is possible to choose a compatible [complex structure](@entry_id:269128) $J_p$ on $T_pM$ that is also preserved by the action. This turns $(T_pM, J_p)$ into an $n$-dimensional [complex vector space](@entry_id:153448) on which $T^n$ acts by unitary transformations. For an [abelian group](@entry_id:139381) like $T^n$, any such representation decomposes into a [direct sum](@entry_id:156782) of irreducible, one-dimensional [complex representations](@entry_id:144331). Thus, we can decompose the [tangent space](@entry_id:141028) as a [direct sum](@entry_id:156782) of $n$ complex lines, $T_pM \cong V_1 \oplus \dots \oplus V_n$, each invariant under the action.

On each line $V_i$, the torus $T^n$ acts via a character $\chi_i: T^n \to U(1)$. By the theory of Lie groups, each character is determined by a unique [linear functional](@entry_id:144884) $\alpha_i \in \mathfrak{t}^*$, known as a **weight**. The action of an element $t = \exp(\theta) \in T^n$ (for $\theta \in \mathfrak{t}$) on a vector in $V_i$ is simply multiplication by the phase $e^{i\langle \alpha_i, \theta \rangle}$. For the [group action](@entry_id:143336) to be well-defined on the torus $T^n = \mathfrak{t}/\Lambda$ (where $\Lambda = \ker(\exp)$ is the integer lattice of the Lie algebra), the characters must be trivial on the kernel of the [exponential map](@entry_id:137184). This imposes the crucial **integrality condition** on the weights:
$$ \langle \alpha_i, \lambda \rangle \in 2\pi\mathbb{Z} \quad \text{for all } \lambda \in \Lambda $$
These $n$ integral weights $\{\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n\}$ completely describe the local action at a fixed point and, as we will see, are the fundamental building blocks of the entire manifold . The effectiveness of the global action implies that these weights must form a basis for $\mathfrak{t}^*$ over $\mathbb{R}$.

### The Delzant Polytope: A Combinatorial Blueprint

The remarkable discovery at the heart of [toric geometry](@entry_id:1133245) is that all the essential information about the [symplectic toric manifold](@entry_id:1132761) $(M, \omega, T^n, \mu)$ is encoded in the shape of the momentum image, $\Delta = \mu(M) \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. However, not just any convex polytope can arise; it must be a very special kind, known as a **Delzant [polytope](@entry_id:635803)**. The defining properties of a Delzant [polytope](@entry_id:635803) are direct combinatorial consequences of the local geometry at the fixed points.

A Delzant polytope is a convex polytope in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that is:
1.  **Simple**: At each vertex, exactly $n$ facets ([codimension](@entry_id:273141)-1 faces) meet.
2.  **Rational**: The polytope can be described by inequalities $\langle x, u_j \rangle \geq c_j$, where each inward-pointing [normal vector](@entry_id:264185) $u_j$ is a primitive vector in the integer lattice $\mathfrak{t}_{\mathbb{Z}} \subset \mathfrak{t}$.
3.  **Smooth (or Unimodular)**: For each vertex $v$, the set of $n$ primitive inward-pointing normal vectors $\{u_{j_1}, \dots, u_{j_n}\}$ to the facets meeting at $v$ forms a $\mathbb{Z}$-basis for the integer lattice $\mathfrak{t}_{\mathbb{Z}}$. This means the [integer matrix](@entry_id:151642) whose columns are these vectors has determinant $\pm 1$.

These conditions are not arbitrary; they are dictated by the underlying geometry. Near a fixed point $p \in M$ with $\mu(p) = v$, the local structure of the momentum map is determined by the [isotropy](@entry_id:159159) weights. The image of a small neighborhood of $p$ is a cone with its apex at $v$, whose edges are generated by the weight vectors. Globally, this means the edges of the polytope $\Delta$ emanating from a vertex $v$ must have directions determined by the [isotropy](@entry_id:159159) weights at the corresponding fixed point $p$ . The inward normal vectors of the facets are, in turn, determined by these edge vectors.

The **simplicity** condition arises because there are precisely $n$ isotropy weights at a fixed point, which span the $n$-dimensional space $\mathfrak{t}^*$. The **rationality** condition reflects the integrality of the weights. The most critical is the **smoothness** or **unimodularity** condition. This condition is equivalent to the requirement that the set of isotropy weights $\{\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n\}$ at a fixed point forms a $\mathbb{Z}$-basis for the [dual lattice](@entry_id:150046) $\mathfrak{t}_{\mathbb{Z}}^*$. If this condition holds, the local action is equivalent to the standard coordinate-wise action of $T^n$ on $\mathbb{C}^n$, and the resulting manifold is smooth.

If the unimodularity condition fails at a vertex—that is, if the determinant of the matrix of primitive inward normals is an integer $m > 1$—the resulting geometric object is not a [smooth manifold](@entry_id:156564) but a symplectic **[orbifold](@entry_id:159587)**. It possesses an **[orbifold](@entry_id:159587) singularity** at the corresponding fixed point, which is locally modeled on the [quotient space](@entry_id:148218) $\mathbb{C}^n / G$ where $G$ is a finite [abelian group](@entry_id:139381) of order $m$.

For example, consider the triangle in $\mathbb{R}^2$ defined by $x \ge 0$, $y \ge 0$, and $x+2y \le 1$. The primitive inward normal vectors are $u_1=(1,0)$, $u_2=(0,1)$, and $u_3=(-1,-2)$. At the vertex $(0, 1/2)$, the meeting facets correspond to normals $u_1=(1,0)$ and $u_3=(-1,-2)$. The matrix formed by these vectors has determinant $\det \begin{pmatrix} 1  -1 \\ 0  -2 \end{pmatrix} = -2$. Since the absolute value is $2 \neq 1$, this polytope is not Delzant. If one were to construct a space from this [polytope](@entry_id:635803), the point corresponding to this vertex would be an [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) singularity of type $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_2$ .

In contrast, consider a [vertex of a polytope](@entry_id:167763) in $\mathbb{R}^3$ whose primitive edge directions are given by $\nu_1 = (1,0,0)$, $\nu_2 = (1,1,0)$, and $\nu_3 = (1,1,1)$. The isotropy weights are $\alpha_i = -\nu_i$. The matrix of these weights has determinant $\det \begin{pmatrix} -1  -1  -1 \\ 0  -1  -1 \\ 0  0  -1 \end{pmatrix} = -1$. The absolute value is 1, satisfying the unimodularity condition. The corresponding fixed point is smooth .

### Delzant's Theorem: The Classification

The intimate relationship between the geometry of the manifold and the combinatorics of its momentum image is fully captured by Delzant's celebrated classification theorem. This theorem provides a complete dictionary, translating the language of symplectic geometry into the language of convex polytopes.

**Delzant's Classification Theorem**: There exists a one-to-one correspondence between the [isomorphism classes](@entry_id:147854) of compact, connected $2n$-dimensional symplectic toric manifolds and the set of $n$-dimensional Delzant [polytopes](@entry_id:635589), considered up to translation.

Let's unpack this statement.
-   An **isomorphism** between two symplectic toric manifolds $(M, \omega, \mu)$ and $(M', \omega', \mu')$ is a $T^n$-equivariant [symplectomorphism](@entry_id:1132764) $\varphi: M \to M'$ that intertwines the [momentum maps](@entry_id:178341) up to a constant shift, i.e., $\mu' \circ \varphi = \mu + c$ for some $c \in \mathfrak{t}^*$.
-   The [equivalence relation](@entry_id:144135) on the polytope side is simply **translation**. Two Delzant polytopes $\Delta$ and $\Delta'$ are considered equivalent if $\Delta' = \Delta + c$ for some $c \in \mathfrak{t}^*$.

The proof of this theorem has two main parts: establishing that every [toric manifold](@entry_id:1133246) gives a unique Delzant [polytope](@entry_id:635803) (up to translation), and showing that every Delzant [polytope](@entry_id:635803) can be used to construct a unique [toric manifold](@entry_id:1133246).

#### Uniqueness: From Manifold to Polytope

This direction follows from the principles we have already discussed. Given a [symplectic toric manifold](@entry_id:1132761), its momentum image $\mu(M)$ is a compact convex polytope by the Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg theorem. The local analysis at fixed points, as we have seen, forces this polytope to be simple, rational, and smooth (unimodular). Therefore, $\mu(M)$ is a Delzant [polytope](@entry_id:635803). The ambiguity in the choice of momentum map (it is only defined up to an additive constant) corresponds precisely to the translation of its image.

#### Existence: The Delzant Construction

The more constructive part of the proof shows how to build a [symplectic toric manifold](@entry_id:1132761) from a given Delzant [polytope](@entry_id:635803) $\Delta \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. This procedure, known as the **Delzant construction** or **symplectic cutting**, is a beautiful application of [symplectic reduction](@entry_id:170200). Let's outline the steps, illustrating with the example of the trapezoid $\Delta \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ defined by $x_1 \ge 0$, $x_2 \ge 0$, $x_2 \le \lambda_2$, and $x_1+ax_2 \le \lambda_1$ for an integer $a \ge 0$ .

1.  **Start with $\mathbb{C}^d$**: Given a Delzant [polytope](@entry_id:635803) $\Delta$ with $d$ facets, begin with the standard $2d$-dimensional symplectic manifold $(\mathbb{C}^d, \omega_{std})$. This space has a standard Hamiltonian action of the $d$-torus $T^d$, with [moment map](@entry_id:157938) $\mu_{T^d}(z) = \frac{1}{2}(|z_1|^2, \dots, |z_d|^2)$.

2.  **Define a Subtorus**: Let $\{u_1, \dots, u_d\} \subset \mathfrak{t}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ be the primitive inward normal vectors to the $d$ facets of $\Delta$. These vectors define a linear map from the Lie algebra of $T^d$ to that of $T^n$, $\beta: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^n$, which sends the $i$-th standard [basis vector](@entry_id:199546) $e_i$ to the normal $u_i$. The kernel of the corresponding Lie [group homomorphism](@entry_id:140603) $T^d \to T^n$ is a subtorus $K \subset T^d$ whose Lie algebra is $\mathfrak{k} = \ker(\beta)$. For our trapezoid example ($n=2, d=4$), the inward normals are $u_1=(1,0)$, $u_2=(0,1)$, $u_3=(0,-1)$, and $u_4=(-1,-a)$. The map $\beta$ has matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0  -1 \\ 0  1  -1  -a \end{pmatrix}$. Its kernel $\mathfrak{k}$ is a 2-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^4$.

3.  **Perform Symplectic Reduction**: The action of the subtorus $K$ on $\mathbb{C}^d$ is itself Hamiltonian, with its own [moment map](@entry_id:157938) $\mu_K: \mathbb{C}^d \to \mathfrak{k}^*$. The final step is to perform symplectic reduction with respect to this $K$-action. We choose a specific [level set](@entry_id:637056) value $\xi \in \mathfrak{k}^*$, determined by the constants defining the facets of $\Delta$. The [symplectic quotient](@entry_id:1132757) is then defined as $M_\Delta = \mu_K^{-1}(\xi) / K$.

The crucial point is that the unimodularity condition on the Delzant polytope $\Delta$ guarantees that the action of $K$ on the level set $\mu_K^{-1}(\xi)$ is free, ensuring that the quotient $M_\Delta$ is a [smooth manifold](@entry_id:156564), not an [orbifold](@entry_id:159587). This constructed manifold is compact, has dimension $2n$, and carries a natural effective Hamiltonian action of the quotient torus $T^n \cong T^d/K$. Furthermore, the image of its momentum map is precisely the starting [polytope](@entry_id:635803) $\Delta$ .

### Geometric Invariants from Combinatorics

The power of Delzant's classification is that it allows the computation of profound geometric and [topological invariants](@entry_id:138526) of a manifold simply by analyzing its corresponding polytope.

#### Symplectic Volume

The total symplectic volume of a [toric manifold](@entry_id:1133246) is directly proportional to the Euclidean volume of its moment polytope. This is a consequence of the **Duistermaat-Heckman theorem**, which describes the [pushforward](@entry_id:158718) of the Liouville [volume form](@entry_id:161784) $\omega^n/n!$ via the momentum map. For a general Hamiltonian $T^r$-action on a $2n$-dimensional manifold, the density of this [pushforward measure](@entry_id:201640) is a [piecewise polynomial](@entry_id:144637) function of degree at most $n-r$. In the special case of toric manifolds, we have $r=n$, so the degree is $0$. This means the density is constant on the interior of the moment polytope $\Delta$ . This leads to the elegant formula:
$$ \mathrm{Vol}_{\text{symp}}(M_\Delta) = \int_{M_\Delta} \frac{\omega^n}{n!} = (2\pi)^n \mathrm{Vol}_{\text{Eucl}}(\Delta) $$
For instance, the area of the trapezoidal polytope from our earlier example  is $\lambda_1\lambda_2 - \frac{1}{2}a\lambda_2^2$. The symplectic volume of the corresponding 4-dimensional manifold $M_\Delta$ is therefore $(2\pi)^2(\lambda_1\lambda_2 - \frac{1}{2}a\lambda_2^2) = 2\pi^2(2\lambda_1\lambda_2 - a\lambda_2^2)$.

#### Topology and Characteristic Classes

The combinatorial data of the [polytope](@entry_id:635803) also determines [topological invariants](@entry_id:138526).
-   **Divisors**: Each facet $F_j$ of the polytope $\Delta$ corresponds to a $T^n$-invariant symplectic [submanifold](@entry_id:262388) $D_j = \mu^{-1}(F_j)$ of [codimension](@entry_id:273141) 2, known as a toric [divisor](@entry_id:188452). These divisors form the homological backbone of the manifold .
-   **Chern Classes**: The first Chern class of the tangent bundle of the manifold can be expressed as the sum of the Poincaré duals of the homology classes of these divisors: $c_1(TM) = \sum_{j=1}^d \text{PD}[D_j]$. Furthermore, the equivariant first Chern class of the [normal bundle](@entry_id:272447) to a [divisor](@entry_id:188452) $D_j$, $c_1^{T}(N_{D_j/M})$, is simply the inward [normal vector](@entry_id:264185) $u_j$ itself, viewed as an element of the equivariant cohomology of a point, $H_T^2(\text{pt};\mathbb{Z})$ .
-   **Maslov Class**: The Lagrangian tori $L_x$ that fiber over the interior of $\Delta$ have an important [topological invariant](@entry_id:142028) called the Maslov class, $\mu_{L_x}: \pi_2(M, L_x) \to \mathbb{Z}$. This class measures the twisting of the [tangent bundle](@entry_id:161294) of $M$ along disks whose boundaries lie on $L_x$. This, too, can be computed from the polytope. For a relative class $\beta \in \pi_2(M, L_x)$ that is a combination of basic disk classes intersecting the divisors $D_i$ with multiplicities $m_i$, the Maslov index is given by the simple formula $\mu_{L_x}(\beta) = 2 \sum_{i=1}^d m_i$ .

In summary, the theory of symplectic toric manifolds provides a beautiful and complete bridge between the continuous world of symplectic geometry and the discrete world of lattice polytopes. The principles and mechanisms outlined in this chapter show how a simple combinatorial object—the Delzant polytope—serves as a comprehensive blueprint for the construction and analysis of a rich class of geometric spaces.
