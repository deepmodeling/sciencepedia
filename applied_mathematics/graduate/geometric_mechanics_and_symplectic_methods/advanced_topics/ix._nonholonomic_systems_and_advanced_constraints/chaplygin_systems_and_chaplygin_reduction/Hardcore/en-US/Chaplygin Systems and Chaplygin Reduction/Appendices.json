            "problem": "Consider a rigid, homogeneous circular disk of mass $m$, radius $R$, and axial moment of inertia $I=\\kappa m R^{2}$ with shape parameter $\\kappa>0$, rolling without slipping on a rigid plane inclined at angle $\\alpha$ with respect to the horizontal, where $0<\\alpha<\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Let $s$ denote the coordinate of the center of mass along the plane, measured in the downslope direction, and let $\\theta$ denote the rotation angle of the disk about its symmetry axis.

It provides all necessary parameters ($m$, $R$, $I$, $\\alpha$) and a clear constraint to determine the unknown forces $F_{t}$ and $N$. The system's accelerations and, consequently, the required forces are constant and independent of initial conditions, ensuring a unique and meaningful solution.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is precise, formal, and free of any subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or infeasibility. It is a standard, formalizable problem in mechanics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nWe apply Newton's second law for translational and rotational motion to the disk. Let's define a coordinate system with the $x$-axis pointing downslope along the inclined plane and the $y$-axis pointing normal to the plane, outwards. The coordinate $s$ corresponds to the position of the C.O.M. along the $x$-axis.\n\nThe forces acting on the disk are:\n$1$. The gravitational force, $\\boldsymbol{W} = m\\boldsymbol{g}$. This can be decomposed into a component parallel to the plane, $mg\\sin(\\alpha)$, acting in the positive $x$-direction (downslope), and a component perpendicular to the plane, $mg\\cos(\\alpha)$, acting in the negative $y$-direction (into the plane).\n$2$. The contact reaction force, which has two components: the normal force $\\boldsymbol{N}$ of magnitude $N$ acting in the positive $y$-direction, and the friction force $\\boldsymbol{F}_{t}$ of magnitude $F_t$ acting in the negative $x$-direction (upslope), as specified.\n\n**Translational Motion**:\nAccording to Newton's second law, $\\sum \\boldsymbol{F} = m\\boldsymbol{a}_{\\text{C.O.M.}}$. The acceleration of the C.O.M. is purely along the $x$-axis, $\\boldsymbol{a}_{\\text{C.O.M.}} = \\ddot{s}\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\imath}}$.\n\nIn the $y$-direction (normal to the plane), the disk has no acceleration. Thus, the forces must balance:\n$$N - mg\\cos(\\alpha) = 0$$\nThis immediately yields the magnitude of the normal force:\n$$N = mg\\cos(\\alpha)$$\n\nIn the $x$-direction (parallel to the plane), the net force causes the C.O.M. to accelerate:\n$$mg\\sin(\\alpha) - F_{t} = m\\ddot{s} \\quad (1)$$\n\n**Rotational Motion**:\nWe calculate the net torque $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ about the C.O.M. The gravitational force $\\boldsymbol{W}$ and the normal force $\\boldsymbol{N}$ both have lines of action passing through the C.O.M., so they produce zero torque. The only force producing a torque about the C.O.M. is the friction force $\\boldsymbol{F}_{t}$, which acts at a perpendicular distance $R$ from the C.O.M.\nLet's define the angle of rotation $\\theta$ to be positive for the sense of rotation corresponding to rolling downslope (a positive $\\ddot{s}$). The friction force $F_t$ (acting upslope) creates a torque that drives this rotation. The magnitude of the torque is $\\tau = R F_{t}$.\nAccording to the rotational analogue of Newton's second law, $\\tau = I\\ddot{\\theta}$, where $I = \\kappa m R^2$ is the moment of inertia about the C.O.M.\n$$R F_{t} = I\\ddot{\\theta} = (\\kappa m R^{2})\\ddot{\\theta} \\quad (2)$$\n\n**Rolling-Without-Slipping Constraint**:\nThe problem states the constraint is $\\dot{s} - R\\dot{\\theta} = 0$, or $\\dot{s} = R\\dot{\\theta}$. Differentiating this with respect to time gives the relationship between the linear and angular accelerations:\n$$\\ddot{s} = R\\ddot{\\theta} \\quad (3)$$\n\n**Solving for the Forces**:\nWe now have a system of three linear equations for the unknowns $\\ddot{s}$, $\\ddot{\\theta}$, and $F_t$.\nFrom equation $(3)$, we have $\\ddot{\\theta} = \\ddot{s}/R$. Substituting this into equation $(2)$:\n$$R F_{t} = (\\kappa m R^{2}) \\left(\\frac{\\ddot{s}}{R}\\right) = \\kappa m R \\ddot{s}$$\n$$F_{t} = \\kappa m \\ddot{s}$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $F_t$ into equation $(1)$:\n$$mg\\sin(\\alpha) - (\\kappa m \\ddot{s}) = m\\ddot{s}$$\n$$mg\\sin(\\alpha) = m\\ddot{s} + \\kappa m \\ddot{s} = m(1+\\kappa)\\ddot{s}$$\nSolving for the linear acceleration $\\ddot{s}$:\n$$\\ddot{s} = \\frac{g\\sin(\\alpha)}{1+\\kappa}$$\nFinally, we can find the friction force $F_t$ by substituting this back into our expression for $F_t$:\n$$F_{t} = \\kappa m \\left(\\frac{g\\sin(\\alpha)}{1+\\kappa}\\right) = \\frac{\\kappa}{1+\\kappa} mg\\sin(\\alpha)$$\nThe results for the forces are:\n$$F_{t} = \\frac{\\kappa}{1+\\kappa} mg\\sin(\\alpha)$$\n$$N = mg\\cos(\\alpha)$$\nThese results are consistent with those obtainable from the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle, which serves as a verification of the method.\n\n**Power of the Contact Reaction**:\nThe instantaneous power $P$ delivered by the total contact reaction force $\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{reaction}} = \\boldsymbol{N} + \\boldsymbol{F}_{t}$ is given by the dot product of this force with the velocity of its point of application, $\\boldsymbol{v}_{\\text{contact}}$:\n$$P = \\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{reaction}} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}_{\\text{contact}}$$\nThe total reaction force is $\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{reaction}} = -F_{t}\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\imath}} + N\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\jmath}}$.\nThe velocity of the contact point on the disk, $\\boldsymbol{v}_{\\text{contact}}$, is the velocity of the C.O.M. plus the velocity of the contact point relative to the C.O.M.: $\\boldsymbol{v}_{\\text{contact}} = \\boldsymbol{v}_{\\text{C.O.M.}} + \\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\times \\boldsymbol{r}_{\\text{contact/C.O.M.}}$.\n- $\\boldsymbol{v}_{\\text{C.O.M.}} = \\dot{s}\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\imath}}$.\n- The angular velocity vector is $\\boldsymbol{\\omega} = \\dot{\\theta}\\boldsymbol{\\hat{k}}$, assuming a coordinate system where $\\boldsymbol{\\hat{k}}$ is into the plane for clockwise rotation (matching positive $\\theta$ for downslope rolling). Or let's use a right-hand rule with axis out of the plane, $\\boldsymbol{\\hat{k}} = \\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\imath}} \\times \\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\jmath}}$, then $\\boldsymbol{\\omega} = -\\dot{\\theta}\\boldsymbol{\\hat{k}}$.\n- The position vector from the C.O.M. to the contact point is $\\boldsymbol{r}_{\\text{contact/C.O.M.}} = -R\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\jmath}}$.\nThe relative velocity is $\\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\times \\boldsymbol{r}_{\\text{contact/C.O.M.}} = (-\\dot{\\theta}\\boldsymbol{\\hat{k}}) \\times (-R\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\jmath}}) = R\\dot{\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{\\hat{k}}\\times\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\jmath}})$. Since $\\boldsymbol{\\hat{k}}\\times\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\jmath}} = -\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\imath}}$, this term is $-R\\dot{\\theta}\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\imath}}$.\nSo, the velocity of the contact point is:\n$$\\boldsymbol{v}_{\\text{contact}} = \\dot{s}\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\imath}} - R\\dot{\\theta}\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\imath}} = (\\dot{s} - R\\dot{\\theta})\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\imath}}$$\nThe instantaneous power is:\n$$P = (-F_{t}\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\imath}} + N\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\jmath}}) \\cdot ((\\dot{s} - R\\dot{\\theta})\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\imath}})$$\n$$P = -F_{t}(\\dot{s} - R\\dot{\\theta}) + N(0) = -F_{t}(\\dot{s} - R\\dot{\\theta})$$\nFor allowed motions, the system must obey the rolling-without-slipping constraint, which is precisely $\\dot{s} - R\\dot{\\theta} = 0$.\nTherefore, the power performed by the total contact reaction on allowed motions is:\n$$P = -F_{t}(0) = 0$$\nThe closed form for the power is $0$.\n\nThe three quantities to be provided are $(F_{t}, N, P)$.\n$F_{t} = \\frac{\\kappa}{1+\\kappa} mg \\sin(\\alpha)$\n$N = mg \\cos(\\alpha)$\n$P = 0$",

            "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of a nonholonomic Chaplygin system. We must first validate the problem statement, then proceed to the calculations and explanations as requested.\n\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed problem in geometric mechanics, resting on established principles of differential geometry and nonholonomic dynamics. The setup is self-contained and mathematically consistent. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, we apply Cartan's test to assess the integrability of the constraint distribution. Second, we relate this result to the curvature of the associated mechanical connection.\n\n**Part 1: Integrability and Cartan's Test**\n\nThe system is defined on the configuration manifold $Q = \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\times S^{1}$ with coordinates $(x,y,\\theta)$. The nonholonomic constraints define a distribution $\\mathcal{D} \\subset TQ$ which is the kernel of the one-form\n$$\n\\omega \\;=\\; d\\theta \\;+\\; \\alpha\\big(x\\,dy - y\\,dx\\big)\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a non-zero constant. A tangent vector $v \\in T_qQ$ belongs to the distribution $\\mathcal{D}_q$ if and only if $\\omega_q(v) = 0$.\n\nThe Frobenius integrability theorem, when applied to a distribution defined as the kernel of a single one-form (i.e., a codimension-one distribution), is known as Cartan's test. It states that the distribution $\\mathcal{D} = \\ker(\\omega)$ is integrable if and only if the one-form $\\omega$ satisfies the condition\n$$\n\\omega \\wedge d\\omega \\;=\\; 0\n$$\nwhere $d\\omega$ is the exterior derivative of $\\omega$. If this condition is not met, the distribution is non-integrable, meaning that no two-dimensional submanifolds (integral manifolds) exist whose tangent spaces coincide with $\\mathcal{D}$ at every point.\n\nWe begin by computing the exterior derivative $d\\omega$.\n$$\nd\\omega \\;=\\; d\\left(d\\theta \\;+\\; \\alpha\\big(x\\,dy - y\\,dx\\big)\\right)\n$$\nUsing the linearity of the exterior derivative and the property that $d(d\\phi) = 0$ for any zero-form $\\phi$, we have $d(d\\theta) = 0$. Thus,\n$$\nd\\omega \\;=\\; d\\left(\\alpha x\\,dy - \\alpha y\\,dx\\right) \\;=\\; \\alpha\\,d(x\\,dy) - \\alpha\\,d(y\\,dx)\n$$\nApplying the product rule for exterior derivatives, $d(fg) = f\\,dg + df \\wedge g$, where $f$ and $g$ are forms:\n$$\nd(x\\,dy) \\;=\\; d(x) \\wedge dy + x \\wedge d(dy) \\;=\\; dx \\wedge dy + 0 \\;=\\; dx \\wedge dy\n$$\n$$\nd(y\\,dx) \\;=\\; d(y) \\wedge dx + y \\wedge d(dx) \\;=\\; dy \\wedge dx + 0 \\;=\\; -dx \\wedge dy\n$$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $d\\omega$:\n$$\nd\\omega \\;=\\; \\alpha(dx \\wedge dy) - \\alpha(-dx \\wedge dy) \\;=\\; 2\\alpha\\,dx \\wedge dy\n$$\nNow, we compute the wedge product $\\omega \\wedge d\\omega$:\n$$\n\\omega \\wedge d\\omega \\;=\\; \\left(d\\theta + \\alpha x\\,dy - \\alpha y\\,dx\\right) \\wedge \\left(2\\alpha\\,dx \\wedge dy\\right)\n$$\nUsing the distributive property of the wedge product:\n$$\n\\omega \\wedge d\\omega \\;=\\; (d\\theta) \\wedge (2\\alpha\\,dx \\wedge dy) + (\\alpha x\\,dy) \\wedge (2\\alpha\\,dx \\wedge dy) - (\\alpha y\\,dx) \\wedge (2\\alpha\\,dx \\wedge dy)\n$$\nThe second and third terms vanish because they contain repeated one-forms in the wedge product:\n$$\n(\\alpha x\\,dy) \\wedge (2\\alpha\\,dx \\wedge dy) \\;=\\; 2\\alpha^2 x \\, (dy \\wedge dx \\wedge dy) \\;=\\; 0\n$$\n$$\n(\\alpha y\\,dx) \\wedge (2\\alpha\\,dx \\wedge dy) \\;=\\; 2\\alpha^2 y \\, (dx \\wedge dx \\wedge dy) \\;=\\; 0\n$$\nThus, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\omega \\wedge d\\omega \\;=\\; 2\\alpha\\,d\\theta \\wedge dx \\wedge dy\n$$\nThe problem asks to find the function $f(x,y)$ such that $\\omega \\wedge d\\omega = f(x,y) \\, dx \\wedge dy \\wedge d\\theta$. We must reorder the basis forms in our result. An even permutation of basis one-forms in a wedge product leaves the sign unchanged, while an odd permutation introduces a negative sign.\n$$\nd\\theta \\wedge dx \\wedge dy \\;=\\; -dx \\wedge d\\theta \\wedge dy \\;=\\; (-1)(-1) dx \\wedge dy \\wedge d\\theta \\;=\\; dx \\wedge dy \\wedge d\\theta\n$$\nThe permutation from $(d\\theta, dx, dy)$ to $(dx, dy, d\\theta)$ is a cycle $(d\\theta \\to dx \\to dy \\to d\\theta)$, which is an even permutation (two swaps). Therefore,\n$$\n\\omega \\wedge d\\omega \\;=\\; 2\\alpha \\,dx \\wedge dy \\wedge d\\theta\n$$\nBy comparing this with the required form $\\omega \\wedge d\\omega = f(x,y) \\, dx \\wedge dy \\wedge d\\theta$, we identify the scalar function $f(x,y)$ as:\n$$\nf(x,y) \\;=\\; 2\\alpha\n$$\nSince $\\alpha$ is a non-zero constant, $f(x,y) = 2\\alpha \\neq 0$. This implies that $\\omega \\wedge d\\omega \\neq 0$. According to Cartan's test, the constraint distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ is therefore **non-integrable**.\n\n**Part 2: Relation to Curvature**\n\nFor a Chaplygin system with symmetry group $G$ acting on $Q$, the constraint distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ that is $G$-equivariant can be interpreted as the horizontal space of a principal connection on the bundle $\\pi: Q \\to S = Q/G$. The shape space is $S = \\mathbb{R}^2$ with coordinates $(x,y)$. The group $G=S^1$ acts by shifts in $\\theta$, so the bundle is $Q = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\times S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nThe one-form $\\omega$ is a connection one-form $\\mathcal{A}$ on this principal bundle. Its kernel defines the horizontal distribution $\\mathcal{D}$, and it maps fundamental vector fields (infinitesimal group actions) to the corresponding Lie algebra elements. The fundamental vector field for the $S^1$ action is $\\xi_Q = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}$. Indeed, $\\mathcal{A}(\\xi_Q) = \\omega(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}) = d\\theta(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}) = 1$, which is the generator of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{s}^1 \\cong \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe curvature two-form $\\Omega$ of the connection $\\mathcal{A}$ is defined by the Cartan structure equation $\\Omega = d\\mathcal{A} + \\frac{1}{2}[\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{A}]_{\\mathfrak{g}}$. Since the group $G=S^1$ is abelian, its Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is abelian, so the Lie bracket term vanishes. The curvature form on the total space $Q$ is simply:\n$$\n\\Omega \\;=\\; d\\mathcal{A} \\;=\\; d\\omega\n$$\nFrom Part 1, we calculated $d\\omega = 2\\alpha\\,dx \\wedge dy$. So,\n$$\n\\Omega \\;=\\; 2\\alpha\\,dx \\wedge dy\n$$\nThe curvature $\\Omega$ is a horizontal two-form on $Q$, meaning it vanishes when contracted with any vertical vector (like $\\xi_Q$). It can therefore be projected down to a unique two-form $\\mathcal{B}$ on the base manifold (shape space) $S$. This is the curvature of the connection, or the \"magnetic field\" in the mechanical analogy. Since $\\Omega$ already depends only on the base coordinates $(x,y)$ and their differentials, the curvature on $S=\\mathbb{R}^2$ is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{B} \\;=\\; 2\\alpha\\,dx \\wedge dy\n$$\nThe non-integrability of the constraints is directly linked to the non-vanishing of this curvature. The Cartan test condition is $\\omega \\wedge d\\omega = \\mathcal{A} \\wedge \\Omega \\neq 0$. Since $\\Omega = \\pi^*\\mathcal{B}$ and $\\mathcal{A} = d\\theta + \\pi^*(\\mathcal{A}_S)$ (where $\\mathcal{A}_S = \\alpha(x\\,dy - y\\,dx)$), we have:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A} \\wedge \\Omega \\;=\\; (d\\theta + \\pi^*\\mathcal{A}_S) \\wedge \\pi^*\\mathcal{B} \\;=\\; d\\theta \\wedge \\pi^*\\mathcal{B} + \\pi^*(\\mathcal{A}_S \\wedge \\mathcal{B})\n$$\nThe term $\\mathcal{A}_S \\wedge \\mathcal{B}$ is a three-form on the two-dimensional manifold $S$, so it is identically zero. This leaves:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A} \\wedge \\Omega \\;=\\; d\\theta \\wedge \\pi^*\\mathcal{B} \\;=\\; d\\theta \\wedge (2\\alpha\\,dx \\wedge dy)\n$$\nThis confirms our calculation in Part 1 and shows that $\\omega \\wedge d\\omega$ is non-zero precisely because the curvature two-form $\\mathcal{B}$ is non-zero. The non-integrability of the constraints is geometrically equivalent to the curvature of the mechanical connection.\n\nThis curvature is crucial for the dynamics. In the Chaplygin reduction procedure, the reduced equations of motion on the shape space $S$ acquire a gyroscopic (or magnetic-like) force term that is directly proportional to the curvature $\\mathcal{B}$. The general form for this force is given by a two-form $\\mathcal{F}^{\\text{gyro}} = -p_\\theta \\mathcal{B}$, where $p_\\theta$ is the momentum conjugate to the cyclic variable $\\theta$. The presence of this force term, which is non-potential and velocity-dependent, is a hallmark of nonholonomic systems and is a direct consequence of the non-integrable (or \"curved\") nature of the constraints. If the curvature $\\mathcal{B}$ were zero, the connection would be flat, the constraints integrable, and no gyroscopic terms would appear in the reduced equations.",

            "solution": "We begin from the mechanical system with configuration manifold $Q = S \\times \\mathbb{S}^{1}$, coordinates $(s^{1}, s^{2}, \\theta)$, and kinetic energy determined by the Riemannian metric\n$$\ng_{Q} = a(s^{1})\\, ds^{1} \\otimes ds^{1} + b(s^{2})\\, ds^{2} \\otimes ds^{2} + I\\, d\\theta \\otimes d\\theta,\n$$\nwith $a(s^{1}) = 1 + (s^{1})^{2}$, $b(s^{2}) = 1 + (s^{2})^{2}$, and constant inertia $I > 0$ along the symmetry direction. The potential is zero, $V \\equiv 0$, so $L = T = \\tfrac{1}{2} g_{Q}(\\dot{q}, \\dot{q})$. The nonholonomic constraint enforces horizontal velocities with respect to the given Ehresmann connection $A$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\theta} + A_{1}(s)\\, \\dot{s}^{1} + A_{2}(s)\\, \\dot{s}^{2} = 0,\n$$\nwhere $A_{1}(s) = \\alpha s^{2}$ and $A_{2}(s) = -\\alpha s^{1}$. The curvature two-form $F$ of $A$ is $F = dA$, and in coordinates on $S$ we have\n$$\nF = \\left(\\frac{\\partial A_{2}}{\\partial s^{1}} - \\frac{\\partial A_{1}}{\\partial s^{2}}\\right) ds^{1} \\wedge ds^{2}.\n$$\nWith $A_{1} = \\alpha s^{2}$ and $A_{2} = -\\alpha s^{1}$, one computes\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial A_{2}}{\\partial s^{1}} = -\\alpha, \\quad \\frac{\\partial A_{1}}{\\partial s^{2}} = \\alpha, \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad F_{12} := \\frac{\\partial A_{2}}{\\partial s^{1}} - \\frac{\\partial A_{1}}{\\partial s^{2}} = -2 \\alpha,\n$$\nso\n$$\nF = F_{12}\\, ds^{1} \\wedge ds^{2} = -2 \\alpha\\, ds^{1} \\wedge ds^{2}.\n$$\n\nWe now perform Chaplygin reduction. The horizontal distribution $\\mathcal{H} = \\ker A$ constrains $\\dot{\\theta}$ by\n$$\n\\dot{\\theta} = -A_{1}(s) \\dot{s}^{1} - A_{2}(s) \\dot{s}^{2}.\n$$\nSince the metric is block-diagonal and $I$ is constant, the reduced metric on the shape space $S$ is simply the restriction of $g_{Q}$ to horizontal directions, which here coincides with\n$$\ng_{S} = a(s^{1})\\, ds^{1} \\otimes ds^{1} + b(s^{2})\\, ds^{2} \\otimes ds^{2}.\n$$\nLet $\\nabla^{S}$ denote the Levi-Civita connection of $g_{S}$. For a diagonal metric $g_{S}$ with $g_{11} = a(s^{1})$ and $g_{22} = b(s^{2})$, the nonzero Christoffel symbols are computed from the standard formula\n$$\n\\Gamma^{i}_{jk} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{i\\ell}\\left(\\frac{\\partial g_{\\ell j}}{\\partial s^{k}} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\ell k}}{\\partial s^{j}} - \\frac{\\partial g_{jk}}{\\partial s^{\\ell}}\\right).\n$$\nBecause $g_{11}$ depends only on $s^{1}$ and $g_{22}$ depends only on $s^{2}$, all mixed derivatives vanish and we obtain\n$$\n\\Gamma^{1}_{11} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\frac{\\partial g_{11}}{\\partial s^{1}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1}{a(s^{1})} \\frac{\\partial a(s^{1})}{\\partial s^{1}}, \\quad \\Gamma^{2}_{22} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} \\frac{\\partial g_{22}}{\\partial s^{2}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1}{b(s^{2})} \\frac{\\partial b(s^{2})}{\\partial s^{2}},\n$$\nwith all other $\\Gamma^{i}_{jk}$ equal to zero. For the specific choices $a(s^{1}) = 1 + (s^{1})^{2}$ and $b(s^{2}) = 1 + (s^{2})^{2}$, it follows that\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial s^{1}} = 2 s^{1}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial s^{2}} = 2 s^{2}, \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\Gamma^{1}_{11}(s) = \\frac{s^{1}}{1 + (s^{1})^{2}}, \\quad \\Gamma^{2}_{22}(s) = \\frac{s^{2}}{1 + (s^{2})^{2}}.\n$$\nThese are the Christoffel-like terms in the compressed equations.\n\nWe now derive the gyroscopic terms. For a simple Chaplygin system with Abelian symmetry and mechanical Lagrangian, the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle combined with projection onto horizontal directions yields the reduced second-order equations on $S$ in the form\n$$\n\\nabla^{S}_{\\dot{s}} \\dot{s} = \\sharp_{S}\\left( I\\, \\sigma \\, \\iota_{\\dot{s}} F \\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\sharp_{S}: T^{*}S \\to TS$ is the musical isomorphism induced by $g_{S}$, $F$ is the curvature two-form, and\n$$\n\\sigma := A_{1}(s)\\, \\dot{s}^{1} + A_{2}(s)\\, \\dot{s}^{2}\n$$\nis the contraction of the connection with the shape velocity, arising from the locked inertia momentum $J = I \\dot{\\theta}$ and the constraint $\\dot{\\theta} = -A_{i} \\dot{s}^{i}$, which together give $J = -I \\sigma$ and hence the horizontal gyroscopic one-form proportional to $I \\sigma\\, \\iota_{\\dot{s}} F$. Concretely, with $F = F_{12}\\, ds^{1} \\wedge ds^{2}$, the interior product by $\\dot{s} = \\dot{s}^{1} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s^{1}} + \\dot{s}^{2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s^{2}}$ gives\n$$\n\\iota_{\\dot{s}} F = F_{12}\\left(\\dot{s}^{1} ds^{2} - \\dot{s}^{2} ds^{1}\\right).\n$$\nThus the gyroscopic one-form is\n$$\n\\beta := I\\, \\sigma \\,\\iota_{\\dot{s}} F = I\\, \\sigma \\, F_{12}\\left(\\dot{s}^{1} ds^{2} - \\dot{s}^{2} ds^{1}\\right).\n$$\nIts components are\n$$\n\\beta_{1} = - I\\, \\sigma \\, F_{12}\\, \\dot{s}^{2}, \\qquad \\beta_{2} = I\\, \\sigma \\, F_{12}\\, \\dot{s}^{1}.\n$$\nApplying $\\sharp_{S}$ with $g_{S}^{-1} = \\operatorname{diag}\\left(g^{11}, g^{22}\\right) = \\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\frac{1}{a(s^{1})}, \\frac{1}{b(s^{2})}\\right)$ yields the gyroscopic vector field components\n$$\nb^{1}(s,\\dot{s}) = g^{11}\\, \\beta_{1} = -\\frac{I\\, \\sigma\\, F_{12}}{a(s^{1})}\\, \\dot{s}^{2}, \\qquad b^{2}(s,\\dot{s}) = g^{22}\\, \\beta_{2} = \\frac{I\\, \\sigma\\, F_{12}}{b(s^{2})}\\, \\dot{s}^{1}.\n$$\nWith $F_{12} = -2 \\alpha$ and $\\sigma = A_{1}(s)\\, \\dot{s}^{1} + A_{2}(s)\\, \\dot{s}^{2} = \\alpha s^{2} \\dot{s}^{1} - \\alpha s^{1} \\dot{s}^{2}$, these become\n$$\nb^{1}(s,\\dot{s}) = \\frac{2 \\alpha I}{a(s^{1})}\\, \\sigma \\, \\dot{s}^{2} = \\frac{2 \\alpha I}{1 + (s^{1})^{2}} \\left(\\alpha s^{2} \\dot{s}^{1} - \\alpha s^{1} \\dot{s}^{2}\\right)\\dot{s}^{2},\n$$\nand\n$$\nb^{2}(s,\\dot{s}) = -\\frac{2 \\alpha I}{b(s^{2})}\\, \\sigma \\, \\dot{s}^{1} = -\\frac{2 \\alpha I}{1 + (s^{2})^{2}} \\left(\\alpha s^{2} \\dot{s}^{1} - \\alpha s^{1} \\dot{s}^{2}\\right)\\dot{s}^{1}.\n$$\nExpanding the products gives the explicit quadratic-in-velocity gyroscopic terms\n$$\nb^{1}(s,\\dot{s}) = \\frac{2 \\alpha^{2} I}{1 + (s^{1})^{2}} \\left( s^{2} \\dot{s}^{1} \\dot{s}^{2} - s^{1} (\\dot{s}^{2})^{2} \\right),\n$$\n$$\nb^{2}(s,\\dot{s}) = -\\frac{2 \\alpha^{2} I}{1 + (s^{2})^{2}} \\left( s^{2} (\\dot{s}^{1})^{2} - s^{1} \\dot{s}^{1} \\dot{s}^{2} \\right).\n$$\n\nCollecting the Christoffel-like terms and the gyroscopic terms, the compressed equations in local coordinates $(s^{1}, s^{2})$ are\n$$\n\\ddot{s}^{1} + \\Gamma^{1}_{11}(s)\\, (\\dot{s}^{1})^{2} = b^{1}(s,\\dot{s}), \\qquad \\Gamma^{1}_{11}(s) = \\frac{s^{1}}{1 + (s^{1})^{2}},\n$$\n$$\n\\ddot{s}^{2} + \\Gamma^{2}_{22}(s)\\, (\\dot{s}^{2})^{2} = b^{2}(s,\\dot{s}), \\qquad \\Gamma^{2}_{22}(s) = \\frac{s^{2}}{1 + (s^{2})^{2}},\n$$\nwith $b^{1}(s,\\dot{s})$ and $b^{2}(s,\\dot{s})$ as above. These exhibit the Christoffel-like terms arising from the Levi-Civita connection of $g_{S}$ and the gyroscopic terms arising from the connection curvature and locked inertia.\n\nThe requested final analytic expressions are the two Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^{1}_{11}$, $\\Gamma^{2}_{22}$ and the two gyroscopic components $b^{1}$, $b^{2}$, presented in the specified order.",
