            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in differential geometry and mechanics, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem asks for a three-part analysis of a nonholonomic constraint distribution on the configuration manifold $Q=\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ with coordinates $(x,y,z,w)$. The distribution $\\mathcal{D}(q)$ at a point $q \\in Q$ is the subspace of the tangent space $T_qQ$ defined as the common kernel of three Pfaffian $1$-forms: $\\omega^{1} = \\mathrm{d}x + y\\,\\mathrm{d}z$, $\\omega^{2} = \\mathrm{d}y + z\\,\\mathrm{d}w$, and $\\omega^{3} = x\\,\\mathrm{d}y - y\\,\\mathrm{d}x + \\mathrm{d}z$.\n\n1) First, we construct the linear map $W(q):T_{q}Q\\to\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and its matrix representation.\nAt any point $q=(x,y,z,w)$, the tangent space $T_{q}Q$ is a $4$-dimensional vector space with a natural basis induced by the coordinates, $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}|_q, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}|_q, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}|_q, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w}|_q\\}$. A tangent vector $v \\in T_qQ$ can be expressed as $v = v_x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}|_q + v_y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}|_q + v_z \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}|_q + v_w \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w}|_q$, and can be represented by a column vector in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ with components $(v_x, v_y, v_z, v_w)$.\nThe constraint distribution $\\mathcal{D}(q)$ is the set of all $v \\in T_qQ$ such that $\\omega^{a}(q) \\cdot v = 0$ for $a \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$. This set of conditions defines a linear map $W(q): T_qQ \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$ whose kernel is precisely $\\mathcal{D}(q)$. The map is defined by its action on a vector $v$:\n$$\nW(q)(v) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\omega^{1}(q) \\cdot v \\\\ \\omega^{2}(q) \\cdot v \\\\ \\omega^{3}(q) \\cdot v \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nTo find the matrix representation of this map, we express the $1$-forms in the dual basis $\\{\\mathrm{d}x, \\mathrm{d}y, \\mathrm{d}z, \\mathrm{d}w\\}$. The coordinate representations of the $1$-forms, which form the rows of the matrix, are:\n$\\omega^{1} = (1, 0, y, 0)$\n$\\omega^{2} = (0, 1, 0, z)$\n$\\omega^{3} = (-y, x, 1, 0)$\nThe matrix $[W(q)]$ of the linear map $W(q)$ is therefore a $3 \\times 4$ matrix:\n$$\n[W(q)] = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & y & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & z \\\\\n-y & x & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\n2) Second, we derive a method to compute $\\operatorname{rank}\\mathcal{D}(q)$ and determine the linear independence of the forms.\nThe problem directs us to use the rank-nullity theorem, which states that for a linear map $F: V \\to U$, $\\dim V = \\dim(\\ker F) + \\operatorname{rank}(F)$. Here, the linear map is $W(q): T_qQ \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$. The domain is $V = T_qQ$, with $\\dim(T_qQ)=4$. The kernel is $\\ker W(q) = \\mathcal{D}(q)$. The rank of the distribution is its dimension, $\\operatorname{rank}\\mathcal{D}(q) = \\dim(\\mathcal{D}(q))$. The rank of the map $W(q)$ is the dimension of its image, which is equal to the rank of its matrix representation, $\\operatorname{rank}W(q) = \\operatorname{rank}[W(q)]$.\nApplying the rank-nullity theorem:\n$$\n\\dim(T_qQ) = \\dim(\\mathcal{D}(q)) + \\operatorname{rank}W(q)\n$$\n$$\n4 = \\operatorname{rank}\\mathcal{D}(q) + \\operatorname{rank}[W(q)]\n$$\nThis gives us the method for computing the rank of the distribution:\n$$\n\\operatorname{rank}\\mathcal{D}(q) = 4 - \\operatorname{rank}[W(q)].\n$$\nThe set of $1$-forms $\\{\\omega^{1}(q),\\omega^{2}(q),\\omega^{3}(q)\\}$ is pointwise linearly independent if and only if the rows of the matrix $[W(q)]$ are linearly independent for every $q$. This is equivalent to the condition that $\\operatorname{rank}[W(q)] = 3$. To check this, we can compute the determinant of a $3 \\times 3$ submatrix of $[W(q)]$. Consider the minor formed by the first three columns:\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & y \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -y & x & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = 1(1 \\cdot 1 - 0 \\cdot x) - 0 + y(0 \\cdot x - 1 \\cdot (-y)) = 1 + y^2.\n$$\nSince $y$ is a real coordinate, $y^2 \\ge 0$, and thus the determinant $1+y^2$ is always greater than or equal to $1$. As this minor is never zero for any $q \\in Q$, the rank of the matrix $[W(q)]$ is always $3$.\nTherefore, the set of $1$-forms $\\{\\omega^{1}(q),\\omega^{2}(q),\\omega^{3}(q)\\}$ is pointwise linearly independent for all $q \\in Q$.\n\n3) Finally, we compute the rank of the distribution at the point $q_{0}=(1,2,0,-1)$.\nUsing the method derived, $\\operatorname{rank}\\mathcal{D}(q_0) = 4 - \\operatorname{rank}[W(q_0)]$. We first evaluate the matrix $[W(q)]$ at $q_0$ by substituting $x=1$, $y=2$, and $z=0$:\n$$\n[W(q_0)] = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-2 & 1 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nAs established in the general analysis, the rank of this matrix must be $3$. We can verify this via row reduction.\nApplying the row operation $R_3 \\to R_3 + 2R_1$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 5 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nApplying the row operation $R_3 \\to R_3 - R_2$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 5 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThis matrix is in row echelon form and has three non-zero rows. Thus, $\\operatorname{rank}[W(q_0)] = 3$.\nThe rank of the distribution at $q_0$ is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{rank}\\mathcal{D}(q_0) = 4 - 3 = 1.\n$$",

From the primary equation, we have:\n$$\n\\dot{\\Omega} = \\mathbb{I}^{-1} \\left( (\\mathbb{I}\\Omega) \\times \\Omega + \\lambda a \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbb{I}^{-1} = \\mathrm{diag}(1/I_1, 1/I_2, 1/I_3)$. Applying the condition $a \\cdot \\dot{\\Omega} = 0$:\n$$\na \\cdot \\left[ \\mathbb{I}^{-1} \\left( (\\mathbb{I}\\Omega) \\times \\Omega + \\lambda a \\right) \\right] = 0\n$$\n$$\na \\cdot \\mathbb{I}^{-1}((\\mathbb{I}\\Omega) \\times \\Omega) + \\lambda (a \\cdot \\mathbb{I}^{-1}a) = 0\n$$\nWe calculate the two terms:\n$$\na \\cdot \\mathbb{I}^{-1}a = e_{3} \\cdot \\mathrm{diag}(1/I_{1}, 1/I_{2}, 1/I_{3}) e_{3} = e_{3} \\cdot (0, 0, 1/I_{3})^T = \\frac{1}{I_{3}}\n$$\n$$\na \\cdot \\mathbb{I}^{-1}((\\mathbb{I}\\Omega) \\times \\Omega) = e_{3} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} (I_{2}-I_{3})\\Omega_{2}\\Omega_{3}/I_{1} \\\\ (I_{3}-I_{1})\\Omega_{3}\\Omega_{1}/I_{2} \\\\ (I_{1}-I_{2})\\Omega_{1}\\Omega_{2}/I_{3} \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{I_{1}-I_{2}}{I_{3}}\\Omega_{1}\\Omega_{2}\n$$\nSubstituting these back into the equation for $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\frac{I_{1}-I_{2}}{I_{3}}\\Omega_{1}\\Omega_{2} + \\lambda \\frac{1}{I_{3}} = 0 \\implies \\lambda = -(I_{1}-I_{2})\\Omega_{1}\\Omega_{2}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the reduced dynamics on the constraint submanifold, which is the plane defined by the constraint $a \\cdot \\Omega = \\Omega_3 = 0$. The reduced vector field $X(\\Omega_1, \\Omega_2)$ is given by the expressions for $\\dot{\\Omega}_{1}$ and $\\dot{\\Omega}_{2}$ evaluated on this submanifold.\n$$\nX(\\Omega_1, \\Omega_2) = (\\dot{\\Omega}_{1}, \\dot{\\Omega}_{2})|_{\\Omega_3=0}\n$$\nThe equations for $\\dot{\\Omega}_{1}$ and $\\dot{\\Omega}_{2}$ are:\n$$\n\\dot{\\Omega}_{1} = \\frac{I_{2}-I_{3}}{I_{1}}\\Omega_{2}\\Omega_{3}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{\\Omega}_{2} = \\frac{I_{3}-I_{1}}{I_{2}}\\Omega_{3}\\Omega_{1}\n$$\nSubstituting the constraint $\\Omega_3 = 0$ into these equations, we obtain the components of the reduced vector field:\n$$\nX_1(\\Omega_1, \\Omega_2) = \\frac{I_{2}-I_{3}}{I_{1}}\\Omega_{2}(0) = 0\n$$\n$$\nX_2(\\Omega_1, \\Omega_2) = \\frac{I_{3}-I_{1}}{I_{2}}(0)\\Omega_{1} = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the reduced vector field on the $(\\Omega_{1}, \\Omega_{2})$-plane is the zero vector field:\n$$\nX(\\Omega_{1}, \\Omega_{2}) = (0, 0)\n$$\nThe divergence of this vector field is, by definition:\n$$\n\\mathrm{div}\\, X = \\frac{\\partial X_{1}}{\\partial \\Omega_{1}} + \\frac{\\partial X_{2}}{\\partial \\Omega_{2}} = \\frac{\\partial (0)}{\\partial \\Omega_{1}} + \\frac{\\partial (0)}{\\partial \\Omega_{2}} = 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\nThe fact that the divergence is zero implies, by Liouville's theorem, that the flow of the reduced system preserves the Lebesgue area form $d\\Omega_{1} \\wedge d\\Omega_{2}$. Thus, the system admits an invariant measure on its reduced space, and this measure is simply the standard area element on the plane. The elaborate setup of the problem, including the asymmetry $I_{1} \\neq I_{2}$, leads to a trivial reduced dynamics in the velocity space $(\\Omega_1, \\Omega_2)$, although the full dynamics in $SO(3)$ would exhibit a non-trivial drift or \"holonomy\". The question, however, only concerns the divergence of the reduced vector field on the velocity plane.",
