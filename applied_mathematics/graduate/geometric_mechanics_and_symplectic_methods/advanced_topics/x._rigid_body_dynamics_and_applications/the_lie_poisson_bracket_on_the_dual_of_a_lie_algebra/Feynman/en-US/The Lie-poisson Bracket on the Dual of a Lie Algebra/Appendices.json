This first exercise explores one of the simplest non-trivial cases: the dual of a two-dimensional solvable Lie algebra. By directly applying the definition, you will compute the fundamental bracket relations and construct the corresponding Poisson bivector, providing a clear link between the Lie algebra's structure constants and the resulting Poisson geometry. This practice is crucial for developing an intuition for how the rank of the Poisson structure can vary across the dual space, a key feature distinguishing Lie-Poisson manifolds from standard symplectic manifolds.",

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically sound, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution. We proceed with the step-by-step derivation.\n\nLet $\\mathfrak{g}$ be the specified two-dimensional Lie algebra with basis $\\{e_{1}, e_{2}\\}$ and the Lie bracket $[e_{1}, e_{2}] = e_{2}$. The coordinate functions on the dual space $\\mathfrak{g}^{*}$ are $x_{i}(\\mu) = \\langle \\mu, e_{i} \\rangle$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, where $\\mu \\in \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$ and $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ is the dual pairing between $\\mathfrak{g}^{*}$ and $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the gradient $\\nabla f(\\mu) \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ for the coordinate functions $f = x_{i}$. The gradient is defined by the relation $\\langle \\nu, \\nabla f(\\mu) \\rangle = \\frac{d}{dt}\\big|_{t=0} f(\\mu + t\\nu)$ for all $\\nu \\in \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$.\nFor the coordinate function $f=x_{i}$, its value at $\\mu + t\\nu$ is:\n$$x_{i}(\\mu + t\\nu) = \\langle \\mu + t\\nu, e_{i} \\rangle$$\nBy the linearity of the dual pairing, this is:\n$$x_{i}(\\mu + t\\nu) = \\langle \\mu, e_{i} \\rangle + t \\langle \\nu, e_{i} \\rangle = x_{i}(\\mu) + t \\langle \\nu, e_{i} \\rangle$$\nThe derivative with respect to $t$ at $t=0$ is:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} x_{i}(\\mu + t\\nu) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} (x_{i}(\\mu) + t \\langle \\nu, e_{i} \\rangle) = \\langle \\nu, e_{i} \\rangle$$\nComparing this to the definition of the gradient, we have the equality:\n$$\\langle \\nu, \\nabla x_{i}(\\mu) \\rangle = \\langle \\nu, e_{i} \\rangle$$\nSince this relation must hold for all $\\nu \\in \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$, it follows by non-degeneracy of the pairing that the elements in $\\mathfrak{g}$ must be equal:\n$$\\nabla x_{i}(\\mu) = e_{i}$$\nThus, the gradient of the coordinate function $x_{1}$ is the constant vector field $e_{1}$, and the gradient of $x_{2}$ is the constant vector field $e_{2}$.\n\nNext, we compute the Poisson brackets of the coordinate functions, $\\{x_{i}, x_{j}\\}$, using the Lie-Poisson bracket formula:\n$$\\{f,g\\}(\\mu) = \\langle \\mu, [\\nabla f(\\mu), \\nabla g(\\mu)] \\rangle$$\nSubstituting $f=x_{i}$ and $g=x_{j}$, and using our result for the gradients, we get:\n$$\\{x_{i}, x_{j}\\}(\\mu) = \\langle \\mu, [e_{i}, e_{j}] \\rangle$$\nWe now compute this for all pairs of indices $(i, j)$:\n- For $(i,j)=(1,1)$: $\\{x_{1}, x_{1}\\}(\\mu) = \\langle \\mu, [e_{1}, e_{1}] \\rangle = \\langle \\mu, 0 \\rangle = 0$.\n- For $(i,j)=(2,2)$: $\\{x_{2}, x_{2}\\}(\\mu) = \\langle \\mu, [e_{2}, e_{2}] \\rangle = \\langle \\mu, 0 \\rangle = 0$.\n- For $(i,j)=(1,2)$: $\\{x_{1}, x_{2}\\}(\\mu) = \\langle \\mu, [e_{1}, e_{2}] \\rangle = \\langle \\mu, e_{2} \\rangle = x_{2}(\\mu)$.\n- For $(i,j)=(2,1)$: $\\{x_{2}, x_{1}\\}(\\mu) = \\langle \\mu, [e_{2}, e_{1}] \\rangle = \\langle \\mu, -[e_{1}, e_{2}] \\rangle = -\\langle \\mu, e_{2} \\rangle = -x_{2}(\\mu)$.\nThese calculations confirm the skew-symmetry property $\\{x_{i}, x_{j}\\} = -\\{x_{j}, x_{i}\\}$. The single bracket $\\{x_{1},x_{2}\\}$ is $x_{2}(\\mu)$.\n\nThe Poisson bivector $\\pi(\\mu)$ is the matrix whose entries are $\\pi^{ij}(\\mu) = \\{x_{i}, x_{j}\\}(\\mu)$. Using the results above, we construct this matrix:\n$$\n\\pi(\\mu) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\{x_{1}, x_{1}\\}(\\mu) & \\{x_{1}, x_{2}\\}(\\mu) \\\\ \\{x_{2}, x_{1}\\}(\\mu) & \\{x_{2}, x_{2}\\}(\\mu) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & x_{2}(\\mu) \\\\ -x_{2}(\\mu) & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo analyze the rank of $\\pi(\\mu)$, we compute its determinant:\n$$\\det(\\pi(\\mu)) = (0)(0) - (x_{2}(\\mu))(-x_{2}(\\mu)) = (x_{2}(\\mu))^{2}$$\nThe rank of a $2 \\times 2$ matrix is determined as follows:\n- If $\\det(\\pi(\\mu)) \\neq 0$, the matrix is invertible, and its rank is $2$. This occurs when $(x_{2}(\\mu))^{2} \\neq 0$, which is equivalent to $x_{2}(\\mu) \\neq 0$.\n- If $\\det(\\pi(\\mu)) = 0$, the matrix is singular, and its rank is less than $2$. This occurs when $x_{2}(\\mu) = 0$. In this specific case, the matrix $\\pi(\\mu)$ becomes the zero matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, which has rank $0$.\n\nIn summary, the rank of the Poisson bivector $\\pi(\\mu)$ depends solely on the coordinate $x_{2}(\\mu)$. The rank is $2$ for any point $\\mu \\in \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$ where $x_{2}(\\mu) \\neq 0$. The rank is $0$ for any point $\\mu \\in \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$ where $x_{2}(\\mu) = 0$. The rank is independent of the coordinate $x_{1}(\\mu)$. The set of points where the rank is $0$ forms the line $x_{2}=0$ in the dual space $\\mathfrak{g}^{*}$. These points correspond to the zero-dimensional coadjoint orbits of the associated Lie group.\n\nThe problem requires reporting the ordered pair $(\\{x_{1},x_{2}\\}(\\mu), \\det(\\pi(\\mu)))$ written in terms of the coordinate functions, which we denote by $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$.\nFrom our derivation:\n- $\\{x_{1}, x_{2}\\}(\\mu) = x_{2}(\\mu)$\n- $\\det(\\pi(\\mu)) = (x_{2}(\\mu))^{2}$\nExpressing these in terms of the coordinate functions gives the pair $(x_{2}, x_{2}^{2})$.",

Let $p = M_{3}$ and let $q$ be the azimuthal angle in the $(M_{1}, M_{2})$-plane.\n$$p(M) = M_{3}$$\n$$q(M) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{M_{2}}{M_{1}}\\right)$$\nThe gradients of these functions are:\n$$\\nabla p = (0, 0, 1) = \\mathbf{e}_{3}$$\n$$\\nabla q = \\nabla \\left( \\arctan\\left(\\frac{M_{2}}{M_{1}}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{1}{1 + (M_{2}/M_{1})^{2}} \\left(-\\frac{M_{2}}{M_{1}^{2}}, \\frac{1}{M_{1}}, 0\\right) = \\frac{1}{M_{1}^{2}+M_{2}^{2}}(-M_{2}, M_{1}, 0)$$\nWe compute the Poisson bracket $\\{p,q\\}$:\n$$\\{p, q\\} = -M \\cdot (\\nabla p \\times \\nabla q) = -(M_{1}, M_{2}, M_{3}) \\cdot \\left( \\mathbf{e}_{3} \\times \\frac{1}{M_{1}^{2}+M_{2}^{2}}(-M_{2}, M_{1}, 0) \\right)$$\nThe cross product is:\n$$\\mathbf{e}_{3} \\times (-M_{2}, M_{1}, 0) = (-M_{1}, -M_{2}, 0)$$\nSo the bracket becomes:\n$$\\{p, q\\} = -(M_{1}, M_{2}, M_{3}) \\cdot \\frac{1}{M_{1}^{2}+M_{2}^{2}}(-M_{1}, -M_{2}, 0) = \\frac{M_{1}^{2} + M_{2}^{2}}{M_{1}^{2}+M_{2}^{2}} = 1$$\nSince $\\{p,q\\}=1$, the pair $(p,q)$ constitutes a set of canonical coordinates on the coadjoint orbit.\n\nAction-angle variables $(J, \\theta)$ are canonical variables such that the Hamiltonian depends only on the action $J$. Our Hamiltonian $H$ depends only on $p=M_{3}$. This suggests that $p$ is directly related to the action variable. The action variable $J$ is defined via the integral $J = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\oint_{\\gamma} p_{c} \\, dq_{c}$ over a single period of motion $\\gamma$. Using our canonical coordinates $(p,q)$, the trajectory is one where $p$ is constant and $q$ varies from $0$ to $2\\pi$.\n$$J = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} p \\, dq = \\frac{p}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} dq = p$$\nThus, the action variable is $J = p = M_{3}$. The corresponding angle variable is our coordinate $q$. So, $(J, q) = (M_3, \\arctan(M_2/M_1))$ are the required action-angle variables.\n\nNow, we express the Hamiltonian purely in terms of the action variable $J$. Since $J=M_3$, we have:\n$$H(J) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{L^{2} - J^{2}}{I} + \\frac{J^{2}}{I_{3}}\\right)$$\nFinally, we find the angular frequency $\\dot{q}$ of the angle variable using Hamilton's equations. For a canonical pair $(J, q)$, the equations of motion are $\\dot{J} = \\{J, H\\}$ and $\\dot{q} = \\{q, H\\}$. Using the general expression for the Poisson bracket in canonical coordinates, $\\{F, G\\} = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial q}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial J} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial J}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial q}$, we find:\n$$\\dot{q} = \\{q, H\\} = \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial q}\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial J} - \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial J}\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{dH}{dJ} - 0 \\cdot 0 = \\frac{dH}{dJ}$$\n(Note that $H$ does not depend on $q$). Differentiating the Hamiltonian with respect to $J$:\n$$\\dot{q} = \\frac{d}{dJ} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{L^{2} - J^{2}}{I} + \\frac{J^{2}}{I_{3}}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(-\\frac{2J}{I} + \\frac{2J}{I_{3}}\\right)$$\n$$\\dot{q} = J\\left(\\frac{1}{I_{3}} - \\frac{1}{I}\\right)$$\nThis is the desired expression for the angular frequency $\\dot{q}$ a function of the action $J$ and the moments of inertia $I$ and $I_3$. This frequency corresponds to the rate of precession of the angular momentum vector $M$ about the body's symmetry axis.",
