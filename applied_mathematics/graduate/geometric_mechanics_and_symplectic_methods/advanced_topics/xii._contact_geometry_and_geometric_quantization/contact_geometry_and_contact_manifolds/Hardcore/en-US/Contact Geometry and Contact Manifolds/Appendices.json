            "solution": "The problem asks for the conformal factor $\\lambda(t)$ associated with the contact flow of the Hamiltonian $H=z$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with the standard contact form $\\alpha = dz - y\\,dx$. This requires three main steps: first, determining the contact Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$; second, integrating this vector field to find its flow $\\varphi_t$; and third, calculating the pullback of the contact form by the flow.\n\nFirst, we determine the Reeb vector field $R_{\\alpha}$, which is required for the definition of $X_H$. The Reeb vector field $R_{\\alpha}$ is uniquely defined by the conditions $\\alpha(R_{\\alpha}) = 1$ and $i_{R_{\\alpha}} d\\alpha = 0$.\nLet us represent $R_{\\alpha}$ in the standard coordinate basis as $R_{\\alpha} = A\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + B\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + C\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$ for some functions $A, B, C$ on $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nThe first condition, $\\alpha(R_{\\alpha}) = 1$, gives:\n$$ \\alpha(R_{\\alpha}) = (dz - y\\,dx) \\left( A\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + B\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + C\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\right) = C - yA = 1 $$\n\nFor the second condition, we first compute the exterior derivative of $\\alpha$:\n$$ d\\alpha = d(dz - y\\,dx) = d(dz) - d(y\\,dx) = 0 - (dy \\wedge dx + y\\,d(dx)) = -dy \\wedge dx = dx \\wedge dy $$\nNow, we compute the interior product $i_{R_{\\alpha}} d\\alpha$:\n$$ i_{R_{\\alpha}} d\\alpha = i_{R_{\\alpha}}(dx \\wedge dy) = (i_{R_{\\alpha}}dx)\\wedge dy - dx \\wedge (i_{R_{\\alpha}}dy) = A\\,dy - B\\,dx $$\nThe second condition, $i_{R_{\\alpha}} d\\alpha = 0$, implies $A\\,dy - B\\,dx = 0$. Since $dx$ and $dy$ form a basis for $1$-forms in the $xy$-plane, their coefficients must be zero, so $A=0$ and $B=0$.\nSubstituting $A=0$ into the first condition $C - yA = 1$ yields $C=1$.\nTherefore, the Reeb vector field is $R_{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$.\n\nNext, we derive the contact Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ for the Hamiltonian $H=z$. The vector field $X_H$ is defined by the equations $\\alpha(X_H) = -H$ and $i_{X_H} d\\alpha = dH - (R_{\\alpha}(H))\\,\\alpha$.\nLet $X_H = X\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + Y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + Z\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$.\nFirst, we evaluate the terms on the right-hand side of the second defining equation. For $H=z$:\n$dH = dz$.\n$R_{\\alpha}(H) = R_{\\alpha}(z) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(z) = 1$.\nThus, the second equation for $X_H$ simplifies to:\n$$ i_{X_H} d\\alpha = dz - (1)(dz - y\\,dx) = y\\,dx $$\nThe left-hand side is $i_{X_H} d\\alpha = i_{X_H}(dx \\wedge dy) = X\\,dy - Y\\,dx$.\nEquating the two expressions for $i_{X_H} d\\alpha$:\n$$ X\\,dy - Y\\,dx = y\\,dx $$\nBy comparing the coefficients of the basis $1$-forms $dx$ and $dy$, we obtain $X=0$ and $-Y=y$, which means $Y=-y$.\n\nNow we use the first defining equation for $X_H$: $\\alpha(X_H) = -H$.\n$$ \\alpha(X_H) = (dz - y\\,dx)\\left(X\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + Y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + Z\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right) = Z - yX $$\nSetting this equal to $-H=-z$, we have $Z - yX = -z$.\nSubstituting the value $X=0$ that we found, we get $Z - y(0) = -z$, so $Z=-z$.\nThe components of the contact Hamiltonian vector field are $X=0$, $Y=-y$, and $Z=-z$. Thus, the vector field is:\n$$ X_H = -y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} - z\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} $$\n\nThe third step is to find the flow $\\varphi_t$ of $X_H$. The flow is the solution to the autonomous system of ordinary differential equations corresponding to the vector field:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{dy}{dt} = -y $$\n$$ \\frac{dz}{dt} = -z $$\nLet the initial conditions at $t=0$ be $(x(0), y(0), z(0)) = (x_0, y_0, z_0)$. Integrating each equation yields:\n$$ x(t) = x_0 $$\n$$ y(t) = y_0 \\exp(-t) $$\n$$ z(t) = z_0 \\exp(-t) $$\nThe flow is the map $\\varphi_t: \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$ given by $\\varphi_t(x_0, y_0, z_0) = (x_0, y_0 \\exp(-t), z_0 \\exp(-t))$.\n\nFinally, to determine the conformal factor $\\lambda(t)$, we compute the pullback of the contact form $\\alpha$ by the flow $\\varphi_t$. Let $(x,y,z)$ be the coordinates of the starting point. The point after time $t$ is $(x', y', z') = \\varphi_t(x,y,z) = (x, y\\exp(-t), z\\exp(-t))$.\nThe pullback $\\varphi_t^*\\alpha$ is calculated by substituting these transformed coordinates into the expression for $\\alpha=dz-y\\,dx$. More formally, using the property $F^*(\\omega_1 - \\omega_2) = F^*\\omega_1 - F^*\\omega_2$ and $F^*(g\\,\\omega) = (g \\circ F) F^*\\omega$:\n$$ \\varphi_t^*\\alpha = \\varphi_t^*(dz-y\\,dx) = \\varphi_t^*(dz) - \\varphi_t^*(y)\\,\\varphi_t^*(dx) $$\nWe compute each term:\n$$ \\varphi_t^*(dz) = d(z \\circ \\varphi_t) = d(z\\exp(-t)) = \\exp(-t)\\,dz $$\n$$ \\varphi_t^*(y) = y \\circ \\varphi_t = y\\exp(-t) $$\n$$ \\varphi_t^*(dx) = d(x \\circ \\varphi_t) = d(x) = dx $$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for the pullback:\n$$ \\varphi_t^*\\alpha = \\exp(-t)\\,dz - (y\\exp(-t))\\,dx = \\exp(-t)(dz - y\\,dx) $$\nSince $\\alpha = dz - y\\,dx$, we have:\n$$ \\varphi_t^*\\alpha = \\exp(-t)\\,\\alpha $$\nBy comparing this result with the given relation $\\varphi_t^*\\alpha = \\lambda(t)\\,\\alpha$, we can identify the conformal factor $\\lambda(t)$.\n\nAn alternative verification can be done using the Lie derivative. The rate of change of the pullback at $t=0$ is the Lie derivative: $\\frac{d}{dt}\\big|_{t=0} \\varphi_t^*\\alpha = \\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\alpha$. A general relation is $\\frac{d}{dt} \\varphi_t^*\\alpha = \\varphi_t^*(\\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\alpha)$.\nUsing Cartan's formula, $\\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\alpha = i_{X_H}d\\alpha + d(i_{X_H}\\alpha)$. From our derivation of $X_H$, we have $i_{X_H}d\\alpha = y\\,dx$ and $i_{X_H}\\alpha = \\alpha(X_H) = -H = -z$. Thus, $d(i_{X_H}\\alpha) = d(-z) = -dz$.\nSo, $\\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\alpha = y\\,dx - dz = -(dz - y\\,dx) = -\\alpha$.\nThe differential equation for the pulled-back form $\\alpha_t = \\varphi_t^*\\alpha$ is $\\frac{d\\alpha_t}{dt} = \\varphi_t^*(-\\alpha) = -\\alpha_t$.\nThe solution to this ordinary differential equation for forms, with initial condition $\\alpha_0 = \\alpha$, is $\\alpha_t = \\alpha \\exp(-t)$. This confirms the previous result.\n\nThe conformal factor is $\\lambda(t) = \\exp(-t)$.",

The derivation must follow a prescribed sequence of steps, starting from first principles.\n\nFirst, we verify that $\\alpha_{t}$ is a contact form for all $t \\in [0,1]$. A $1$-form $\\alpha$ on a $3$-dimensional manifold is a contact form if the volume form $\\alpha \\wedge d\\alpha$ is nowhere zero. We compute the exterior derivative of $\\alpha_{t}$:\n$$\nd\\alpha_{t} = d(dz - \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y\\, dx) = d(dz) - d(\\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y\\, dx)\n$$\nSince $d(dz)=0$ and using the product rule for exterior derivatives, we have:\n$$\nd\\alpha_{t} = - [ (d(\\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y)) \\wedge dx + (\\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y) d(dx) ] = - [ (\\exp(\\lambda t)\\, dy) \\wedge dx ] = \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, dx \\wedge dy\n$$\nNow, we compute the wedge product $\\alpha_{t} \\wedge d\\alpha_{t}$:\n$$\n\\alpha_{t} \\wedge d\\alpha_{t} = (dz - \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y\\, dx) \\wedge (\\exp(\\lambda t)\\, dx \\wedge dy)\n$$\n$$\n= \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy - (\\exp(\\lambda t))^{2}\\, y\\, dx \\wedge dx \\wedge dy\n$$\nSince $dx \\wedge dx = 0$, the second term vanishes. Permuting the basis forms in the first term, we get:\n$$\n\\alpha_{t} \\wedge d\\alpha_{t} = \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy = - \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$\nGiven that $\\lambda$ is a real constant, $\\exp(\\lambda t)$ is strictly positive for all $t \\in [0,1]$. The standard volume form $dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$ is nowhere zero on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Thus, $\\alpha_{t} \\wedge d\\alpha_{t}$ is nowhere zero, which confirms that $\\alpha_{t}$ is a contact form for all $t \\in [0,1]$.\n\nSecond, as required, we determine the Reeb vector field $R_{t}$ associated with the contact form $\\alpha_{t}$. The Reeb vector field is uniquely defined by the two conditions: $i_{R_{t}} d\\alpha_{t} = 0$ and $\\alpha_{t}(R_t) = 1$. Let $R_{t} = U \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + V \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + W \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$ for some functions $U, V, W$.\nThe first condition is $i_{R_{t}} (\\exp(\\lambda t)\\, dx \\wedge dy) = 0$.\n$$\ni_{U \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + V \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + W \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}} (\\exp(\\lambda t)\\, dx \\wedge dy) = \\exp(\\lambda t) (U\\,i_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}}(dx \\wedge dy) + V\\,i_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}}(dx \\wedge dy)) = \\exp(\\lambda t) (U\\,dy - V\\,dx)\n$$\nFor this $1$-form to be zero, its components must be zero, which implies $U=0$ and $V=0$. So, the Reeb vector field must be of the form $R_{t} = W \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$.\nThe second condition is $\\alpha_{t}(R_{t})=1$.\n$$\n\\alpha_{t}(W \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}) = (dz - \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y\\, dx) \\left( W \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\right) = W \\cdot dz\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right) - W \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y \\cdot dx\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right) = W \\cdot 1 - 0 = W\n$$\nThus, $W=1$. The Reeb vector field is $R_{t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$. Notably, it is independent of $t$.\n\nThird, we derive the transport equation that determines the vector field $X_{t}$. We start with the given condition $\\phi_{t}^{*}\\alpha_{t} = \\alpha_{0}$. Since $\\alpha_{0}$ is constant with respect to $t$, its time derivative is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} (\\phi_{t}^{*}\\alpha_{t}) = 0\n$$\nUsing the identity for the time derivative of a pullback, $\\frac{d}{dt}(\\phi_{t}^{*}\\omega_{t}) = \\phi_{t}^{*}(\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\omega_{t} + \\frac{d\\omega_{t}}{dt})$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\phi_{t}^{*}\\left(\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\alpha_{t} + \\frac{d\\alpha_{t}}{dt}\\right) = 0\n$$\nSince the flow map $\\phi_{t}$ is a diffeomorphism for each $t$, its pullback operator $\\phi_{t}^{*}$ is an isomorphism. Therefore, the $1$-form inside the parentheses must be zero:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\alpha_{t} + \\frac{d\\alpha_{t}}{dt} = 0\n$$\nThis is the transport equation. We compute the time derivative of $\\alpha_{t}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\alpha_{t}}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (dz - \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y\\, dx) = - \\lambda \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y\\, dx\n$$\nSubstituting this into the transport equation gives:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\alpha_{t} = - \\frac{d\\alpha_{t}}{dt} = \\lambda \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y\\, dx\n$$\nFourth, we solve for $X_{t}$ using Cartan's formula, $\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\alpha_{t} = d(i_{X_{t}}\\alpha_{t}) + i_{X_{t}}(d\\alpha_{t})$.\n$$\nd(i_{X_{t}}\\alpha_{t}) + i_{X_{t}}(d\\alpha_{t}) = \\lambda \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y\\, dx\n$$\nThis equation relates $X_{t}$ to the known forms. To find a particular solution for $X_{t}$, we can make a simplifying ansatz, which is a standard step in the Moser method. Let us seek a vector field $X_{t}$ that satisfies the condition $i_{X_{t}}\\alpha_{t} = 0$. With this choice, the first term $d(i_{X_{t}}\\alpha_{t})$ vanishes, and the equation simplifies to:\n$$\ni_{X_{t}}(d\\alpha_{t}) = \\lambda \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y\\, dx\n$$\nLet $X_{t} = U \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + V \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + W \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$, where $U,V,W$ are functions of $(x,y,z,t)$. We have already computed $d\\alpha_t = \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, dx \\wedge dy$. The interior product is:\n$$\ni_{X_{t}}(d\\alpha_{t}) = i_{U \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + V \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + W \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}} (\\exp(\\lambda t)\\, dx \\wedge dy) = \\exp(\\lambda t) (U\\,dy - V\\,dx)\n$$\nComparing this with the right-hand side, $\\lambda \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y\\, dx$, we equate the coefficients of $dx$ and $dy$:\n$$\n-\\exp(\\lambda t) V = \\lambda \\exp(\\lambda t) y \\implies V = -\\lambda y\n$$\n$$\n\\exp(\\lambda t) U = 0 \\implies U = 0\n$$\nNow we use our ansatz, $i_{X_{t}}\\alpha_{t} = 0$, to determine $W$.\n$$\ni_{X_{t}}\\alpha_{t} = \\alpha_{t}(X_{t}) = (dz - \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y\\, dx)\\left(U \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + V \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + W \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right) = W - \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y\\, U = 0\n$$\nSince $U=0$, we find that $W=0$. Thus, a valid vector field is $X_{t} = -\\lambda y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$. Note that this vector field is independent of $t$. Let's denote it by $X$.\n\nFinally, we integrate the vector field $X = -\\lambda y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$ to find its flow $\\phi_{t}$. The flow is the solution to the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), $\\frac{d}{dt}\\vec{p}(t) = X(\\vec{p}(t))$, with initial condition $\\vec{p}(0) = \\vec{p}_{0} = (x,y,z)$. Let $\\vec{p}(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))$. The system of ODEs is:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = -\\lambda y\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dz}{dt} = 0\n$$\nwith initial conditions $x(0)=x$, $y(0)=y$, $z(0)=z$.\nIntegrating the first and third equations gives $x(t)=x$ and $z(t)=z$.\nThe second equation is a separable first-order linear ODE: $\\frac{dy}{y} = -\\lambda dt$. Integrating both sides yields $\\ln|y| = -\\lambda t + C$. Exponentiating gives $y(t) = K \\exp(-\\lambda t)$. Using the initial condition $y(0)=y$, we find $K=y$. So, $y(t) = y \\exp(-\\lambda t)$.\nThe flow map is therefore:\n$$\n\\phi_{t}(x,y,z) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)) = (x, y \\exp(-\\lambda t), z)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the explicit expression for $\\phi_{1}(x,y,z)$. We set $t=1$:\n$$\n\\phi_{1}(x,y,z) = (x, y \\exp(-\\lambda), z)\n$$\nThis represents the state of a point $(x,y,z)$ after evolving for a time interval of $1$ under the flow of $X$.",

It asks for the derivation of the local normal form of a contact $1$-form $\\alpha$ in a neighborhood of a point on a Legendrian submanifold $L$. All terms and concepts are standard and the problem is well-posed.\n\nLet the contact manifold be $(M, \\alpha)$ of dimension $2n+1$. Let $L \\subset M$ be an $n$-dimensional Legendrian submanifold. We are given local coordinates $(x, y, z) = (x_1, \\dots, x_n, y_1, \\dots, y_n, z)$ in a neighborhood of a point $p \\in L$, such that $p$ corresponds to the origin $(0,0,0)$ and $L$ is locally described by the equations $\\{y=0, z=0\\}$. The coordinates on $L$ are thus the $x_i$.\n\nLet the $1$-form $\\alpha$ be written in these local coordinates as:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\sum_{i=1}^n A_i(x,y,z) dx_i + \\sum_{j=1}^n B_j(x,y,z) dy_j + C(x,y,z) dz\n$$\nThe component functions $A_i, B_j, C$ are smooth functions of $(x,y,z)$.\n\n**Step 1: Application of the Legendrian Condition**\nA submanifold $L$ is Legendrian if its tangent spaces are contained within the contact distribution, i.e., $T_qL \\subset \\xi_q = \\ker(\\alpha_q)$ for all $q \\in L$. This is equivalent to the condition that the pullback of $\\alpha$ to $L$ is zero, $i^*\\alpha = 0$, where $i: L \\hookrightarrow M$ is the inclusion map.\n\nIn our coordinates, $L$ is given by $y=0, z=0$. The inclusion is $i(x) = (x,0,0)$. The tangent space $T_xL$ is spanned by the vectors $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1}, \\dots, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_n}\\}$. The pullback $i^*\\alpha$ is the restriction of $\\alpha$ to $L$.\n$$\ni^*\\alpha = \\sum_{i=1}^n A_i(x,0,0) dx_i + \\sum_{j=1}^n B_j(x,0,0) \\cdot 0 + C(x,0,0) \\cdot 0 = \\sum_{i=1}^n A_i(x,0,0) dx_i\n$$\nThe condition $i^*\\alpha = 0$ implies that $A_i(x,0,0) = 0$ for all $i=1,\\dots,n$ in a neighborhood of $x=0$. This gives us strong constraints on the Taylor expansion of the functions $A_i$ around the origin $p=(0,0,0)$. Specifically, $A_i(0,0,0)=0$, and all partial derivatives of $A_i$ with respect to the $x_k$ variables must vanish at points on $L$, in particular at the origin: $\\frac{\\partial A_i}{\\partial x_k}(0,0,0) = 0$ for all $i,k$.\n\nThis means the Taylor expansion of $A_i$ at the origin starts with terms linear in $y$ and $z$:\n$$\nA_i(x,y,z) = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\frac{\\partial A_i}{\\partial y_j}(0) y_j + \\frac{\\partial A_i}{\\partial z}(0) z + O(|(y,z)|^2) + O(|x||(y,z)|)\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Normalization at the Point $p$**\nThe condition that $\\alpha$ is a contact form is $\\alpha \\wedge (d\\alpha)^n \\neq 0$ everywhere. At $p=0$, we have:\n$\\alpha_p = \\sum_{j=1}^n B_j(0) dy_j + C(0) dz$.\nFor $\\alpha_p$ to be non-zero, not all $B_j(0)$ and $C(0)$ can be zero. We can perform a linear change of coordinates in the $(y,z)$ space, which preserves the submanifold $L=\\{y=0,z=0\\}$, to simplify $\\alpha_p$. If $C(0)\\neq0$, we can define a new coordinate $z' = C(0)z + \\sum B_j(0)y_j$ and new $y'_j$ coordinates that are linear combinations of the old $y_j$. If $C(0)=0$, a similar argument works as long as some $B_j(0)\\neq0$. After such a transformation (and relabeling coordinates), we can assume without loss of generality that:\n$$\n\\alpha_p = dz \\quad \\implies \\quad B_j(0)=0 \\text{ for all } j, \\text{ and } C(0)=1.\n$$\nNow, let's compute $d\\alpha$ at $p=0$.\n$$\nd\\alpha = \\sum_{i=1}^n dA_i \\wedge dx_i + \\sum_{j=1}^n dB_j \\wedge dy_j + dC \\wedge dz\n$$\nAt $p=0$, the relevant partial derivatives are:\n$$\nd\\alpha_p = \\sum_{i,j} \\frac{\\partial A_i}{\\partial y_j}(0) dy_j \\wedge dx_i + \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial A_i}{\\partial z}(0) dz \\wedge dx_i + \\sum_{j,k} \\frac{\\partial B_j}{\\partial x_k}(0) dx_k \\wedge dy_j + \\dots\n$$\nWe have used $A_i(0)=0$, $\\frac{\\partial A_i}{\\partial x_k}(0)=0$, $B_j(0)=0$, $C(0)=1$.\n$$\nd\\alpha_p = \\sum_{i,k} \\left(\\frac{\\partial B_k}{\\partial x_i}(0) - \\frac{\\partial A_i}{\\partial y_k}(0)\\right) dx_i \\wedge dy_k + \\sum_i \\left(\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x_i}(0) - \\frac{\\partial A_i}{\\partial z}(0)\\right) dx_i \\wedge dz + \\sum_j \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y_j}(0) dy_j \\wedge dz\n$$\nThe contact condition $\\alpha_p \\wedge (d\\alpha_p)^n \\neq 0$ becomes $dz \\wedge (d\\alpha_p)^n \\neq 0$. This implies that the $n$-th exterior power of the component of $d\\alpha_p$ in the $dx \\wedge dy$ plane must be non-zero. Let $\\omega_p = \\sum_{i,k} \\left(\\frac{\\partial B_k}{\\partial x_i}(0) - \\frac{\\partial A_i}{\\partial y_k}(0)\\right) dx_i \\wedge dy_k$. The condition requires $\\omega_p^n \\neq 0$, which means $\\omega_p$ is a non-degenerate $2$-form on the $2n$-dimensional space spanned by $\\{\\partial/\\partial x_i, \\partial/\\partial y_j\\}$. By Darboux's theorem for linear symplectic forms, we can make a linear change of coordinates in $x$ and $y$ (which preserves $L$) such that this form becomes canonical. We choose the form $\\sum_{i=1}^n dx_i \\wedge dy_i$.\nSo, we can assume coordinates are chosen such that at $p=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial B_k}{\\partial x_i}(0) - \\frac{\\partial A_i}{\\partial y_k}(0) = \\delta_{ik}\n$$\nA convenient choice satisfying this is $\\frac{\\partial B_k}{\\partial x_i}(0) = 0$ for all $i,k$ and $\\frac{\\partial A_i}{\\partial y_k}(0) = -\\delta_{ik}$.\n\n**Step 3: Application of the Reeb Vector Field Condition**\nThe Reeb vector field $R_\\alpha$ is defined by $\\alpha(R_\\alpha)=1$ and $i_{R_\\alpha}d\\alpha = 0$. At $p=0$, $\\alpha_p(R_\\alpha(p)) = dz(R_\\alpha(p)) = 1$. This means the $z$-component of $R_\\alpha(p)$ is $1$. The problem allows us to choose a contactomorphism whose differential at $p$ fixes $R_\\alpha(p)$. We can use this freedom to align our coordinate system such that $R_\\alpha(p) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$.\nThe condition $i_{R_\\alpha(p)} d\\alpha_p = 0$ becomes $i_{\\partial/\\partial z} d\\alpha_p = 0$.\n$$\ni_{\\partial/\\partial z} d\\alpha_p = -\\sum_i \\left(\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x_i}(0) - \\frac{\\partial A_i}{\\partial z}(0)\\right) dx_i + \\sum_j \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y_j}(0) dy_j = 0\n$$\nThis implies $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x_i}(0) = \\frac{\\partial A_i}{\\partial z}(0)$ and $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y_j}(0) = 0$ for all $i,j$.\nGathering all first-order information, we have forced $\\alpha$ to agree with the canonical form $\\alpha_{can} = dz - \\sum_i y_i dx_i$ to first order at the origin.\nFor $\\alpha_{can}$: $A_i = -y_i, B_j=0, C=1$.\nDerivatives at $0$: $\\frac{\\partial A_i}{\\partial y_k}(0)=-\\delta_{ik}$, $\\frac{\\partial B_j}{\\partial x_k}(0)=0$, $C(0)=1$. All other first derivatives are zero, which matches our derived constraints.\n\n**Step 4: Higher-Order Terms and the Contact Neighborhood Theorem**\nWe have established that by an affine transformation of coordinates, any such contact form $\\alpha$ can be brought into a state where it and its first derivatives at $p$ match those of the model form $\\alpha_{can} = dz - \\sum_i y_i dx_i$.\nSo we can write $\\alpha = dz - \\sum_i y_i dx_i + \\beta$, where $\\beta$ is a $1$-form whose component functions vanish to at least second order at the origin.\nThe next step in the proof of the normal form is to use a Moser-type argument. One constructs a family of forms $\\alpha_t = \\alpha_{can} + t\\beta$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ and seeks an isotopy (a family of diffeomorphisms) $\\phi_t$ starting at the identity, generated by a vector field $X_t$, such that $\\phi_t^*\\alpha_t$ is constant in $t$. This leads to the \"Moser equation\" $L_{X_t}\\alpha_t + \\dot{\\alpha_t} = 0$, where $\\dot{\\alpha_t} = \\beta$. One can show that this equation is solvable for $X_t$ under the given conditions, and that $X_t$ can be chosen to vanish on $L$. The resulting diffeomorphism $\\phi=\\phi_1$ transforms $\\alpha$ into $\\alpha_{can}$ (up to multiplication by a non-vanishing function, which can also be eliminated).\n\nThe problem explicitly allows invoking the **Contact Neighborhood Theorem for Legendrian Submanifolds**. This powerful theorem is the conclusion of the argument sketched above. It states that for any Legendrian submanifold $L^n$ in a contact manifold $(M^{2n+1}, \\alpha)$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $L$ and a contactomorphism $\\phi: (U, \\alpha|_U) \\to (V, f \\alpha_{can})$, where $V$ is a neighborhood of the zero section in the 1-jet bundle $J^1(L) \\cong T^*L \\times \\mathbb{R}$, $\\alpha_{can}$ is the canonical contact form on $J^1(L)$, and $f$ is a non-vanishing function. The map $\\phi$ takes $L$ to the zero section. In local coordinates $(x,y,z)$ where $L$ is $\\{y=0, z=0\\}$, the canonical form is $\\alpha_{can} = dz - \\sum_i y_i dx_i$. Furthermore, by absorbing the function $f$ into the contactomorphism (a result known as Gray's stability theorem), one can find coordinates where the form $\\alpha$ itself becomes equal to the canonical form.\n\nThe specific question is which quadratic terms can be removed by a contactomorphism fixing $L$ to first order (i.e., its differential at $p$ is the identity). The theorem states that there is a coordinate system in which $\\alpha$ has a canonical form with no quadratic (or higher order) terms at all. The process of finding this coordinate system starts with an affine transformation (fixing first order terms) and is followed by a higher-order transformation (fixing the rest) generated by the Moser method. The resulting total transformation is a contactomorphism that is tangent to the identity at $p$ along $L$.\n\nTherefore, all quadratic terms can be removed. The resulting normal form is free of any higher-order terms.\n\n**Final Normal Form**\nBased on the contact neighborhood theorem, there exist local coordinates $(x,y,z)$ around $p$ in which $L$ is given by $\\{y=0, z=0\\}$ and the contact form $\\alpha$ is given by the following canonical expression.\n\n$$\n\\alpha = dz - \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i dx_i\n$$\nNote that the choice of sign is a convention; $\\alpha = dz + \\sum_i y_i dx_i$ is an equally valid normal form, reachable by the coordinate change $y_i \\mapsto -y_i$. We adopt the convention common in geometric mechanics.",
