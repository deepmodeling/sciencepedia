            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is a well-posed, self-contained mathematical exercise in the field of contact geometry, based on established definitions and principles. We will proceed with a step-by-step derivation.\n\nThe problem asks for the conformal factor $\\lambda(t)$ associated with the contact flow of the Hamiltonian $H=z$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with the standard contact form $\\alpha = dz - y\\,dx$. This requires three main steps: first, determining the contact Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$; second, integrating this vector field to find its flow $\\varphi_t$; and third, calculating the pullback of the contact form by the flow.\n\nFirst, we determine the Reeb vector field $R_{\\alpha}$, which is required for the definition of $X_H$. The Reeb vector field $R_{\\alpha}$ is uniquely defined by the conditions $\\alpha(R_{\\alpha}) = 1$ and $\\iota_{R_{\\alpha}} d\\alpha = 0$.\nLet us represent $R_{\\alpha}$ in the standard coordinate basis as $R_{\\alpha} = A\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + B\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + C\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$ for some functions $A, B, C$ on $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nThe first condition, $\\alpha(R_{\\alpha}) = 1$, gives:\n$$ \\alpha(R_{\\alpha}) = (dz - y\\,dx) \\left( A\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + B\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + C\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\right) = C - yA = 1 $$\n\nFor the second condition, we first compute the exterior derivative of $\\alpha$:\n$$ d\\alpha = d(dz - y\\,dx) = d(dz) - d(y \\wedge dx) = 0 - (dy \\wedge dx + y\\,d(dx)) = -dy \\wedge dx = dx \\wedge dy $$\nNow, we compute the interior product $\\iota_{R_{\\alpha}} d\\alpha$:\n$$ \\iota_{R_{\\alpha}} d\\alpha = \\iota_{R_{\\alpha}}(dx \\wedge dy) = (\\iota_{R_{\\alpha}}dx)\\wedge dy - dx \\wedge (\\iota_{R_{\\alpha}}dy) = A\\,dy - B\\,dx $$\nThe second condition, $\\iota_{R_{\\alpha}} d\\alpha = 0$, implies $A\\,dy - B\\,dx = 0$. Since $dx$ and $dy$ form a basis for $1$-forms in the $xy$-plane, their coefficients must be zero, so $A=0$ and $B=0$.\nSubstituting $A=0$ into the first condition $C - yA = 1$ yields $C=1$.\nTherefore, the Reeb vector field is $R_{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$.\n\nNext, we derive the contact Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ for the Hamiltonian $H=z$. The vector field $X_H$ is defined by the equations $\\alpha(X_H) = H$ and $\\iota_{X_H} d\\alpha = -dH + (R_{\\alpha}(H))\\,\\alpha$.\nLet $X_H = X\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + Y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + Z\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$.\nFirst, we evaluate the terms on the right-hand side of the second defining equation. For $H=z$:\n$dH = dz$.\n$R_{\\alpha}(H) = R_{\\alpha}(z) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(z) = 1$.\nThus, the second equation for $X_H$ simplifies to:\n$$ \\iota_{X_H} d\\alpha = -dz + (1)(dz - y\\,dx) = -y\\,dx $$\nThe left-hand side is $\\iota_{X_H} d\\alpha = \\iota_{X_H}(dx \\wedge dy) = X\\,dy - Y\\,dx$.\nEquating the two expressions for $\\iota_{X_H} d\\alpha$:\n$$ X\\,dy - Y\\,dx = -y\\,dx $$\nBy comparing the coefficients of the basis $1$-forms $dx$ and $dy$, we obtain $X=0$ and $-Y=-y$, which means $Y=y$.\n\nNow we use the first defining equation for $X_H$: $\\alpha(X_H) = H$.\n$$ \\alpha(X_H) = (dz - y\\,dx)\\left(X\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + Y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + Z\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right) = Z - yX $$\nSetting this equal to $H=z$, we have $Z - yX = z$.\nSubstituting the value $X=0$ that we found, we get $Z - y(0) = z$, so $Z=z$.\nThe components of the contact Hamiltonian vector field are $X=0$, $Y=y$, and $Z=z$. Thus, the vector field is:\n$$ X_H = y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + z\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} $$\n\nThe third step is to find the flow $\\varphi_t$ of $X_H$. The flow is the solution to the autonomous system of ordinary differential equations corresponding to the vector field:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{dy}{dt} = y $$\n$$ \\frac{dz}{dt} = z $$\nLet the initial conditions at $t=0$ be $(x(0), y(0), z(0)) = (x_0, y_0, z_0)$. Integrating each equation yields:\n$$ x(t) = x_0 $$\n$$ y(t) = y_0 \\exp(t) $$\n$$ z(t) = z_0 \\exp(t) $$\nThe flow is the map $\\varphi_t: \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$ given by $\\varphi_t(x_0, y_0, z_0) = (x_0, y_0 \\exp(t), z_0 \\exp(t))$.\n\nFinally, to determine the conformal factor $\\lambda(t)$, we compute the pullback of the contact form $\\alpha$ by the flow $\\varphi_t$. Let $(x,y,z)$ be the coordinates of the starting point. The point after time $t$ is $(x', y', z') = \\varphi_t(x,y,z) = (x, y\\exp(t), z\\exp(t))$.\nThe pullback $\\varphi_t^*\\alpha$ is calculated by substituting these transformed coordinates into the expression for $\\alpha=dz-y\\,dx$. More formally, using the property $F^*(\\omega_1 - \\omega_2) = F^*\\omega_1 - F^*\\omega_2$ and $F^*(g\\,\\omega) = (g \\circ F) F^*\\omega$:\n$$ \\varphi_t^*\\alpha = \\varphi_t^*(dz-y\\,dx) = \\varphi_t^*(dz) - \\varphi_t^*(y)\\,\\varphi_t^*(dx) $$\nWe compute each term:\n$$ \\varphi_t^*(dz) = d(z \\circ \\varphi_t) = d(z\\exp(t)) = \\exp(t)\\,dz $$\n$$ \\varphi_t^*(y) = y \\circ \\varphi_t = y\\exp(t) $$\n$$ \\varphi_t^*(dx) = d(x \\circ \\varphi_t) = d(x) = dx $$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for the pullback:\n$$ \\varphi_t^*\\alpha = \\exp(t)\\,dz - (y\\exp(t))\\,dx = \\exp(t)(dz - y\\,dx) $$\nSince $\\alpha = dz - y\\,dx$, we have:\n$$ \\varphi_t^*\\alpha = \\exp(t)\\,\\alpha $$\nBy comparing this result with the given relation $\\varphi_t^*\\alpha = \\lambda(t)\\,\\alpha$, we can identify the conformal factor $\\lambda(t)$.\n\nAn alternative verification can be done using the Lie derivative. The rate of change of the pullback at $t=0$ is the Lie derivative: $\\frac{d}{dt}\\big|_{t=0} \\varphi_t^*\\alpha = \\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\alpha$. A general relation is $\\frac{d}{dt} \\varphi_t^*\\alpha = \\varphi_t^*(\\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\alpha)$.\nUsing Cartan's formula, $\\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\alpha = \\iota_{X_H}d\\alpha + d(\\iota_{X_H}\\alpha)$. From our derivation of $X_H$, we have $\\iota_{X_H}d\\alpha = -y\\,dx$ and $\\iota_{X_H}\\alpha = \\alpha(X_H) = H = z$. Thus, $d(\\iota_{X_H}\\alpha) = d(z) = dz$.\nSo, $\\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\alpha = -y\\,dx + dz = dz - y\\,dx = \\alpha$.\nThe differential equation for the pulled-back form $\\alpha_t = \\varphi_t^*\\alpha$ is $\\frac{d\\alpha_t}{dt} = \\varphi_t^*(\\alpha) = \\alpha_t$.\nThe solution to this ordinary differential equation for forms, with initial condition $\\alpha_0 = \\alpha$, is $\\alpha_t = \\alpha \\exp(t)$. This confirms the previous result.\n\nThe conformal factor is $\\lambda(t) = \\exp(t)$.",

The derivation must follow a prescribed sequence of steps, starting from first principles.\n\nFirst, we verify that $\\alpha_{t}$ is a contact form for all $t \\in [0,1]$. A $1$-form $\\alpha$ on a $3$-dimensional manifold is a contact form if the volume form $\\alpha \\wedge d\\alpha$ is nowhere zero. We compute the exterior derivative of $\\alpha_{t}$:\n$$\nd\\alpha_{t} = d(dz - \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y\\, dx) = d(dz) - d(\\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y\\, dx)\n$$\nSince $d(dz)=0$ and using the product rule for exterior derivatives, we have:\n$$\nd\\alpha_{t} = - [ (d(\\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y)) \\wedge dx + (\\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y) d(dx) ] = - [ (\\exp(\\lambda t)\\, dy) \\wedge dx ] = \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, dx \\wedge dy\n$$\nNow, we compute the wedge product $\\alpha_{t} \\wedge d\\alpha_{t}$:\n$$\n\\alpha_{t} \\wedge d\\alpha_{t} = (dz - \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y\\, dx) \\wedge (\\exp(\\lambda t)\\, dx \\wedge dy)\n$$\n$$\n= \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy - (\\exp(\\lambda t))^{2}\\, y\\, dx \\wedge dx \\wedge dy\n$$\nSince $dx \\wedge dx = 0$, the second term vanishes. Permuting the basis forms in the first term, we get:\n$$\n\\alpha_{t} \\wedge d\\alpha_{t} = \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy = - \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$\nGiven that $\\lambda$ is a real constant, $\\exp(\\lambda t)$ is strictly positive for all $t \\in [0,1]$. The standard volume form $dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$ is nowhere zero on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Thus, $\\alpha_{t} \\wedge d\\alpha_{t}$ is nowhere zero, which confirms that $\\alpha_{t}$ is a contact form for all $t \\in [0,1]$.\n\nSecond, as required, we determine the Reeb vector field $R_{t}$ associated with the contact form $\\alpha_{t}$. The Reeb vector field is uniquely defined by the two conditions: $\\iota_{R_{t}} d\\alpha_{t} = 0$ and $\\alpha_{t}(R_{t}) = 1$, where $\\iota_{R_{t}}$ denotes the interior product with $R_{t}$. Let $R_{t} = U \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + V \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + W \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$ for some functions $U, V, W$.\nThe first condition is $\\iota_{R_{t}} (\\exp(\\lambda t)\\, dx \\wedge dy) = 0$.\n$$\n\\iota_{U \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + V \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + W \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}} (\\exp(\\lambda t)\\, dx \\wedge dy) = \\exp(\\lambda t) (U\\,\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}}(dx \\wedge dy) + V\\,\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}}(dx \\wedge dy)) = \\exp(\\lambda t) (U\\,dy - V\\,dx)\n$$\nFor this $1$-form to be zero, its components must be zero, which implies $U=0$ and $V=0$. So, the Reeb vector field must be of the form $R_{t} = W \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$.\nThe second condition is $\\alpha_{t}(R_{t})=1$.\n$$\n\\alpha_{t}(W \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}) = (dz - \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y\\, dx) \\left( W \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\right) = W \\cdot dz\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right) - W \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y \\cdot dx\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right) = W \\cdot 1 - 0 = W\n$$\nThus, $W=1$. The Reeb vector field is $R_{t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$. Notably, it is independent of $t$.\n\nThird, we derive the transport equation that determines the vector field $X_{t}$. We start with the given condition $\\phi_{t}^{*}\\alpha_{t} = \\alpha_{0}$. Since $\\alpha_{0}$ is constant with respect to $t$, its time derivative is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} (\\phi_{t}^{*}\\alpha_{t}) = 0\n$$\nUsing the identity for the time derivative of a pullback, $\\frac{d}{dt}(\\phi_{t}^{*}\\omega_{t}) = \\phi_{t}^{*}(\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\omega_{t} + \\frac{d\\omega_{t}}{dt})$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\phi_{t}^{*}\\left(\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\alpha_{t} + \\frac{d\\alpha_{t}}{dt}\\right) = 0\n$$\nSince the flow map $\\phi_{t}$ is a diffeomorphism for each $t$, its pullback operator $\\phi_{t}^{*}$ is an isomorphism. Therefore, the $1$-form inside the parentheses must be zero:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\alpha_{t} + \\frac{d\\alpha_{t}}{dt} = 0\n$$\nThis is the transport equation. We compute the time derivative of $\\alpha_{t}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\alpha_{t}}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (dz - \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y\\, dx) = - \\lambda \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y\\, dx\n$$\nSubstituting this into the transport equation gives:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\alpha_{t} = - \\frac{d\\alpha_{t}}{dt} = \\lambda \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y\\, dx\n$$\nFourth, we solve for $X_{t}$ using Cartan's formula, $\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\alpha_{t} = d(\\iota_{X_{t}}\\alpha_{t}) + \\iota_{X_{t}}(d\\alpha_{t})$.\n$$\nd(\\iota_{X_{t}}\\alpha_{t}) + \\iota_{X_{t}}(d\\alpha_{t}) = \\lambda \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y\\, dx\n$$\nThis equation relates $X_{t}$ to the known forms. To find a particular solution for $X_{t}$, we can make a simplifying ansatz, which is a standard step in the Moser method. Let us seek a vector field $X_{t}$ that satisfies the condition $\\iota_{X_{t}}\\alpha_{t} = 0$. With this choice, the first term $d(\\iota_{X_{t}}\\alpha_{t})$ vanishes, and the equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\iota_{X_{t}}(d\\alpha_{t}) = \\lambda \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y\\, dx\n$$\nLet $X_{t} = U \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + V \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + W \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$, where $U,V,W$ are functions of $(x,y,z,t)$. We have already computed $d\\alpha_t = \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, dx \\wedge dy$. The interior product is:\n$$\n\\iota_{X_{t}}(d\\alpha_{t}) = \\iota_{U \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + V \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + W \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}} (\\exp(\\lambda t)\\, dx \\wedge dy) = \\exp(\\lambda t) (U\\,dy - V\\,dx)\n$$\nComparing this with the right-hand side, $\\lambda \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y\\, dx$, we equate the coefficients of $dx$ and $dy$:\n$$\n-\\exp(\\lambda t) V = \\lambda \\exp(\\lambda t) y \\implies V = -\\lambda y\n$$\n$$\n\\exp(\\lambda t) U = 0 \\implies U = 0\n$$\nNow we use our ansatz, $\\iota_{X_{t}}\\alpha_{t} = 0$, to determine $W$.\n$$\n\\iota_{X_{t}}\\alpha_{t} = \\alpha_{t}(X_{t}) = (dz - \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y\\, dx)\\left(U \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + V \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + W \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right) = W - \\exp(\\lambda t)\\, y\\, U = 0\n$$\nSince $U=0$, we find that $W=0$. Thus, a valid vector field is $X_{t} = -\\lambda y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$. Note that this vector field is independent of $t$. Let's denote it by $X$.\n\nFinally, we integrate the vector field $X = -\\lambda y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$ to find its flow $\\phi_{t}$. The flow is the solution to the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), $\\frac{d}{dt}\\vec{p}(t) = X(\\vec{p}(t))$, with initial condition $\\vec{p}(0) = \\vec{p}_{0} = (x,y,z)$. Let $\\vec{p}(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))$. The system of ODEs is:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = -\\lambda y\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dz}{dt} = 0\n$$\nwith initial conditions $x(0)=x$, $y(0)=y$, $z(0)=z$.\nIntegrating the first and third equations gives $x(t)=x$ and $z(t)=z$.\nThe second equation is a separable first-order linear ODE: $\\frac{dy}{y} = -\\lambda dt$. Integrating both sides yields $\\ln|y| = -\\lambda t + C$. Exponentiating gives $y(t) = K \\exp(-\\lambda t)$. Using the initial condition $y(0)=y$, we find $K=y$. So, $y(t) = y \\exp(-\\lambda t)$.\nThe flow map is therefore:\n$$\n\\phi_{t}(x,y,z) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)) = (x, y \\exp(-\\lambda t), z)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the explicit expression for $\\phi_{1}(x,y,z)$. We set $t=1$:\n$$\n\\phi_{1}(x,y,z) = (x, y \\exp(-\\lambda), z)\n$$\nThis represents the state of a point $(x,y,z)$ after evolving for a time interval of $1$ under the flow of $X$.",

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent.\n\n**Part 1: Definition of the Maslov Class**\n\nLet $(\\mathbb{R}^{2n}, \\omega_0)$ be the standard symplectic vector space. The Lagrangian Grassmannian, $\\mathrm{Lag}(n)$, is the manifold of all its $n$-dimensional Lagrangian subspaces. Its first cohomology group with integer coefficients is $H^1(\\mathrm{Lag}(n); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. A generator of this group is called the universal Maslov class, denoted $\\mu$.\n\nNow, consider the Legendrian submanifold $\\Lambda^n \\subset S^{2n+1}$. For each point $p \\in \\Lambda$, its tangent space $T_p\\Lambda$ is an $n$-dimensional subspace of the tangent space $T_pS^{2n+1}$. The Legendrian condition $T\\Lambda \\subset \\xi$ means that for each $p \\in \\Lambda$, $T_p\\Lambda$ is a subspace of the contact distribution fiber $\\xi_p$. The fiber $\\xi_p$ is a $2n$-dimensional vector space, and the restriction $\\omega_p = (\\mathrm{d}\\alpha)_p|_{\\xi_p}$ is a symplectic form on it. One can show that for any two vectors $v,w \\in T_p\\Lambda$, $\\omega_p(v,w) = \\mathrm{d}\\alpha(v,w) = v(\\alpha(w)) - w(\\alpha(v)) - \\alpha([v,w])$. Since $\\alpha$ is zero on any vector tangent to $\\Lambda$, all terms on the right are zero. Thus, $T_p\\Lambda$ is a Lagrangian subspace of $(\\xi_p, \\omega_p)$.\n\nThis gives a family of Lagrangian subspaces, $\\{T_p\\Lambda\\}_{p \\in \\Lambda}$, but each lives in a different ambient vector space $\\xi_p$. To compare them and define a map to a single fixed $\\mathrm{Lag}(n)$, we need to identify all fibers $\\xi_p$ with a fixed $2n$-dimensional symplectic vector space $V$. This is achieved by choosing a trivialization of the symplectic vector bundle $\\xi|_\\Lambda$, which is a bundle isomorphism $\\Psi: \\xi|_\\Lambda \\to \\Lambda \\times V$ such that for each $p \\in \\Lambda$, the map $\\Psi_p: \\xi_p \\to V$ is a symplectomorphism. A \"unitary\" trivialization is one that also respects the compatible complex structure $J$ on $\\xi$.\n\nGiven such a trivialization $\\Psi$, the **Lagrangian Gauss map** $\\gamma: \\Lambda \\to \\mathrm{Lag}(n)$ is defined by\n$$\n\\gamma(p) = \\Psi_p(T_p\\Lambda)\n$$\nThis map sends each point $p \\in \\Lambda$ to the Lagrangian subspace of the fixed vector space $V$ that corresponds to $T_p\\Lambda$ under the trivialization. While $\\gamma$ depends on the choice of $\\Psi$, the induced map on cohomology does not.\n\nThe **Maslov class of $\\Lambda$**, denoted $\\mu_\\Lambda$, is the pullback of the universal Maslov class $\\mu$ by the Gauss map:\n$$\n\\mu_\\Lambda := \\gamma^* \\mu \\in H^1(\\Lambda; \\mathbb{Z})\n$$\nThis is a cohomology class on $\\Lambda$, which is the topological invariant we need to compute.\n\n**Part 2: Computation for the Standard Legendrian Sphere**\n\nThe submanifold is $\\Lambda = S^n$ given by the real locus in $\\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$. The Maslov class $\\mu_\\Lambda$ is an element of $H^1(S^n; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Case 1: $n > 1$**\n\nFor a sphere of dimension $n>1$, the first homology group with integer coefficients is trivial: $H_1(S^n; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. By the universal coefficient theorem for cohomology, the first cohomology group is given by $H^1(S^n; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathrm{Hom}(H_1(S^n; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$. Since the domain is the trivial group, this group is also trivial:\n$$\nH^1(S^n; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } n > 1\n$$\nThe Maslov class $\\mu_\\Lambda$ must be an element of this group. The only element of the trivial group is the zero element. Therefore, for $n>1$, the Maslov class is necessarily zero. As an integer, this corresponds to $0$.\n\n**Case 2: $n = 1$**\n\nFor $n=1$, the submanifold is the circle $\\Lambda = S^1$. The first cohomology group is $H^1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The Maslov class $\\mu_\\Lambda$ can be identified with an integer, which is its evaluation on the generator of $H_1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z})$, i.e., the Maslov index of a loop that traverses $S^1$ once.\n\nLet's construct the Gauss map. The bundle $\\xi|_{S^1}$ is isomorphic to $TS^1 \\otimes_\\mathbb{R} \\mathbb{C}$. Since $TS^1$ is a trivial real line bundle (it is parallelizable), $TS^1 \\otimes \\mathbb{C}$ is a trivial complex line bundle. We can construct an explicit trivialization.\n\nLet's parametrize $\\Lambda = S^1$ by $p(t) = (\\cos t, 0, \\sin t, 0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^4 \\subset \\mathbb{C}^2$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\nThe tangent vector to $S^1$ is $p'(t) = (-\\sin t, 0, \\cos t, 0)$, which spans the tangent space $T_{p(t)}\\Lambda$.\nThe fiber $\\xi_{p(t)}$ is the $2$-dimensional space spanned by $f_1(t) = (-\\sin t, 0, \\cos t, 0)$ and $f_2(t) = (0, -\\sin t, 0, \\cos t)$.\nSo, $T_{p(t)}\\Lambda = \\mathrm{span}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\{f_1(t)\\}$.\n\nWe define a trivialization $\\Psi: \\xi|_{S^1} \\to S^1 \\times \\mathbb{C}$ by creating a global frame. Let the frame at $p(t)$ be $\\{f_1(t), f_2(t)\\}$. We define the fiber map $\\Psi_{p(t)}: \\xi_{p(t)} \\to \\mathbb{C}$ by declaring that it maps this frame to the standard basis $\\{1, i\\}$ of $\\mathbb{C}$:\n$$\n\\Psi_{p(t)}(a f_1(t) + b f_2(t)) = a + ib.\n$$\nThis defines a unitary trivialization. Now we compute the Gauss map $\\gamma(p(t)) = \\Psi_{p(t)}(T_{p(t)}\\Lambda)$.\n$$\nT_{p(t)}\\Lambda = \\mathrm{span}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\{f_1(t)\\}\n$$\nApplying $\\Psi_{p(t)}$ to this space gives:\n$$\n\\gamma(p(t)) = \\Psi_{p(t)}(\\mathrm{span}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\{f_1(t)\\}) = \\mathrm{span}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\{\\Psi_{p(t)}(f_1(t))\\} = \\mathrm{span}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\{1\\} = \\mathbb{R}\n$$\nThe Gauss map $\\gamma: S^1 \\to \\mathrm{Lag}(1)$ sends every point $p(t) \\in S^1$ to the same Lagrangian subspace in $\\mathbb{C}$, namely the real axis $\\mathbb{R}$. This means $\\gamma$ is a constant map.\n\nThe Maslov class is $\\mu_\\Lambda = \\gamma^* \\mu$. The pullback of any cohomology class by a constant map is the zero class. Thus, $\\mu_\\Lambda=0$. The corresponding integer is $0$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nFor all $n > 1$, the Maslov class is zero because $H^1(S^n; \\mathbb{Z})$ is the trivial group. For $n=1$, a direct computation using the definition of the Gauss map shows that the map is constant, and thus the pullback is the zero class. Therefore, the Maslov class for the standard Legendrian sphere $\\Lambda=S^n$ is $0$ for all $n \\ge 1$.",
