## Introduction
At the intersection of differential geometry, topology, and dynamical systems lies the elegant theory of Reeb dynamics. This field studies a canonical flow on contact manifolds, geometric spaces endowed with a special structure that generalizes the notion of energy surfaces in classical mechanics. The central objects of interest are periodic Reeb orbits—closed loops traced by the flow—which encode a remarkable amount of information about the underlying geometry and dynamics of the system. Understanding the existence, stability, and proliferation of these orbits is a fundamental problem that unlocks deep insights into phenomena ranging from the motion of celestial bodies to the rigidity of symplectic spaces.

This article provides a comprehensive exploration of Reeb dynamics and its periodic orbits. We will begin in the first chapter, "Principles and Mechanisms," by establishing the foundational concepts: defining the contact manifold and the unique Reeb vector field it supports, exploring the properties of the Reeb flow, and classifying [periodic orbits](@entry_id:275117) based on their linearized dynamics. The second chapter, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections," will demonstrate the power of this theory by connecting it to Hamiltonian mechanics, celestial mechanics, [symplectic topology](@entry_id:1132760), and modern Floer-theoretic invariants like Embedded Contact Homology. Finally, the "Hands-On Practices" chapter will guide you through concrete calculations, allowing you to compute Reeb vector fields, analyze orbit actions, and determine their stability in key examples, thereby solidifying your theoretical understanding.

## Principles and Mechanisms

### The Reeb Vector Field

The study of Reeb dynamics begins with the fundamental geometric structures of a contact manifold. A **[contact manifold](@entry_id:1122958)** is a pair $(M, \alpha)$, where $M$ is a smooth manifold of odd dimension $2n-1$ and $\alpha$ is a smooth 1-form, known as the **contact form**, that satisfies the maximal non-degeneracy condition $\alpha \wedge (d\alpha)^{n-1} \neq 0$ at every point. This condition implies that the 2-form $d\alpha$ is non-degenerate on the **contact hyperplane distribution** $\xi = \ker \alpha$, endowing $\xi$ with the structure of a symplectic [vector bundle](@entry_id:157593).

At the heart of [contact dynamics](@entry_id:747783) lies a canonical vector field uniquely determined by the [contact form](@entry_id:1122954).

#### Definition and Uniqueness

For any [contact form](@entry_id:1122954) $\alpha$ on a manifold $M$, there exists a unique vector field $R_{\alpha}$, called the **Reeb vector field**, that satisfies the following two conditions:
1.  $\iota_{R_{\alpha}}\alpha = 1$
2.  $\iota_{R_{\alpha}}d\alpha = 0$

Here, $\iota_X \beta$ denotes the [interior product](@entry_id:158127) (or contraction) of a vector field $X$ with a [differential form](@entry_id:174025) $\beta$. The first condition, $\alpha(R_{\alpha}) = 1$, normalizes the vector field and implies that $R_{\alpha}$ is everywhere transverse to the contact distribution $\xi$. Geometrically, $R_{\alpha}$ points in the unique direction "upwards" out of the contact planes, with a length determined by $\alpha$. The second condition states that $R_{\alpha}$ lies in the kernel of the 2-form $d\alpha$. On a [contact manifold](@entry_id:1122958), this kernel is a one-dimensional distribution. The combination of these two conditions uniquely specifies $R_{\alpha}$ at every point on $M$ . A common error is to assume that the Reeb vector field lies within the contact distribution $\xi$; on the contrary, it is defined by being transverse to it .

The flow generated by the Reeb vector field is known as the **Reeb flow**. Its [integral curves](@entry_id:161858) are the central objects of study in Reeb dynamics.

#### Fundamental Properties of the Reeb Flow

A crucial property of the Reeb flow is that it preserves the contact form that defines it. This can be verified directly using Cartan's magic formula for the Lie derivative, $\mathcal{L}_X \beta = d(\iota_X \beta) + \iota_X d\beta$. For the Reeb vector field $R_{\alpha}$, we have:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{R_{\alpha}}\alpha = d(\iota_{R_{\alpha}}\alpha) + \iota_{R_{\alpha}}d\alpha = d(1) + 0 = 0
$$
Since the Lie derivative $\mathcal{L}_{R_{\alpha}}\alpha$ is zero, the flow of $R_{\alpha}$ preserves $\alpha$. Consequently, it also preserves the 2-form $d\alpha$ and the [volume form](@entry_id:161784) $\alpha \wedge (d\alpha)^{n-1}$ .

The relationship between the [contact form](@entry_id:1122954) and the Reeb vector field is sensitive to scaling. If we consider a new [contact form](@entry_id:1122954) $\alpha' = c\alpha$ for some positive constant $c$, the associated Reeb vector field $R_{\alpha'}$ can be related to $R_{\alpha}$. The defining equations for $R_{\alpha'}$ are $\alpha'(R_{\alpha'}) = 1$ and $\iota_{R_{\alpha'}}d\alpha' = 0$. Substituting $\alpha' = c\alpha$, the second condition becomes $c(\iota_{R_{\alpha'}}d\alpha) = 0$, which implies $\iota_{R_{\alpha'}}d\alpha = 0$. Since $R_{\alpha}$ spans the kernel of $d\alpha$, $R_{\alpha'}$ must be proportional to $R_{\alpha}$, say $R_{\alpha'} = k R_{\alpha}$ for some function $k$. The first condition then determines $k$:
$$
1 = \alpha'(R_{\alpha'}) = (c\alpha)(k R_{\alpha}) = ck \cdot \alpha(R_{\alpha}) = ck \cdot 1
$$
This gives $k = 1/c$. Thus, under a constant positive scaling of the [contact form](@entry_id:1122954), the Reeb vector field scales by the inverse factor: $R_{\alpha'} = \frac{1}{c}R_{\alpha}$ . This simple but fundamental relationship has important consequences for the periods of [closed orbits](@entry_id:273635).

#### Relation to Hamiltonian Dynamics

Reeb dynamics is not an isolated subject; it is intimately connected to Hamiltonian mechanics. This connection becomes explicit when considering energy [hypersurfaces](@entry_id:159491) in a symplectic manifold. Let $(W, \omega)$ be a $2n$-dimensional symplectic manifold, where $\omega$ is a closed, non-degenerate 2-form. Given a Hamiltonian function $H: W \to \mathbb{R}$, the **Hamiltonian vector field** $X_H$ is defined by the equation $\iota_{X_H}\omega = dH$.

Consider a regular energy level set $\Sigma = H^{-1}(c)$. Such a hypersurface is said to be of **contact type** if there exists a Liouville form $\lambda$ (a 1-form such that $d\lambda = \omega$) whose restriction to $\Sigma$, denoted $\alpha = \lambda|_{\Sigma}$, is a contact form on $\Sigma$. In this scenario, the Hamiltonian dynamics on $\Sigma$ is equivalent to a Reeb flow.

The Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ is tangent to $\Sigma$ because $dH(X_H) = \omega(X_H, X_H) = 0$. Let's examine how $X_H|_{\Sigma}$ relates to the Reeb field $R_{\alpha}$ on $(\Sigma, \alpha)$. First, we check the condition $\iota_{X_H|_{\Sigma}}d\alpha$. For any vector $v \in T\Sigma$:
$$
(d\alpha)(X_H, v) = (d\lambda|_{\Sigma})(X_H, v) = \omega(X_H, v) = dH(v) = 0
$$
Since this holds for all $v \in T\Sigma$, we have $\iota_{X_H|_{\Sigma}}d\alpha = 0$. This means $X_H|_{\Sigma}$ must be proportional to $R_{\alpha}$, i.e., $X_H|_{\Sigma} = f \cdot R_{\alpha}$ for some function $f: \Sigma \to \mathbb{R}$. To find $f$, we compute:
$$
f = f \cdot \alpha(R_{\alpha}) = \alpha(f \cdot R_{\alpha}) = \alpha(X_H|_{\Sigma}) = (\lambda|_{\Sigma})(X_H|_{\Sigma}) = \lambda(X_H)|_{\Sigma}
$$
Thus, $X_H|_{\Sigma} = (\lambda(X_H)|_{\Sigma}) \cdot R_{\alpha}$. The function $\lambda(X_H)$ is non-vanishing on $\Sigma$ (a consequence of the contact-type condition) and can often be arranged to be positive. This demonstrates that the Hamiltonian flow on the energy surface is a [reparametrization](@entry_id:176404) of the Reeb flow. Consequently, the unparametrized trajectories of the two flows coincide. In particular, the search for [periodic orbits](@entry_id:275117) of a Hamiltonian flow on a contact-type energy surface is equivalent to the search for [periodic orbits](@entry_id:275117) of the associated Reeb flow .

However, it is important to note that the Hamiltonian flow does not, in general, preserve the induced [contact form](@entry_id:1122954) $\alpha$. A calculation using Cartan's formula reveals that $\mathcal{L}_{X_H|_{\Sigma}}\alpha = d(\lambda(X_H)|_{\Sigma})$, which is typically non-zero .

### Periodic Reeb Orbits and Their Classification

The primary objects of interest in Reeb dynamics are the **periodic Reeb orbits**: non-constant [integral curves](@entry_id:161858) $\gamma: \mathbb{R}/T\mathbb{Z} \to M$ of the Reeb vector field $R_{\alpha}$ for some period $T>0$. These are closed loops in the manifold traced by the Reeb flow.

#### Period and Rescaling

The period $T$ of a closed orbit $\gamma$ can be recovered by integrating the contact form along it:
$$
\int_{\gamma} \alpha = \int_0^T \alpha(\dot{\gamma}(t)) \, dt = \int_0^T \alpha(R_{\alpha}(\gamma(t))) \, dt = \int_0^T 1 \, dt = T
$$
This fact, combined with our earlier observation about rescaling, tells us how the period transforms. If $\alpha' = c\alpha$, the new period $T'$ of the same geometric curve is:
$$
T' = \int_{\gamma} \alpha' = \int_{\gamma} c\alpha = c \int_{\gamma} \alpha = cT
$$
So, while the Reeb velocity scales by $1/c$, the time required to trace the orbit scales by $c$ .

#### Linearized Dynamics and Stability

To understand the behavior of the flow near a [periodic orbit](@entry_id:273755) $\gamma$, we study the linearized dynamics. Let $\phi^t$ be the Reeb flow. The linearized map at time $T$ along the orbit, $D\phi^T(\gamma(0)): T_{\gamma(0)}M \to T_{\gamma(0)}M$, governs the evolution of infinitesimal perturbations.

Since the flow $\phi^t$ preserves the [contact structure](@entry_id:635649) $\xi = \ker\alpha$, the linearized map preserves the contact plane at each point of the orbit: $D\phi^T(\gamma(0))(\xi_{\gamma(0)}) = \xi_{\gamma(0)}$. We can therefore restrict the linearized map to this transverse subspace. This restricted map,
$$
P_{\gamma} = D\phi^T|_{\xi_{\gamma(0)}}: \xi_{\gamma(0)} \to \xi_{\gamma(0)}
$$
is called the **linearized return map** or **linearized Poincaré map**.

Furthermore, because $\phi^t$ preserves the 2-form $d\alpha$, the map $P_{\gamma}$ is a **symplectic linear transformation** with respect to the symplectic form $\omega_{\gamma(0)} = d\alpha|_{\xi_{\gamma(0)}}$. This means $P_{\gamma} \in \mathrm{Sp}(\xi_{\gamma(0)}, \omega_{\gamma(0)})$, which is isomorphic to the standard [symplectic group](@entry_id:189031) $\mathrm{Sp}(2n-2, \mathbb{R})$ .

The eigenvalues of $P_{\gamma}$ are called the **Floquet multipliers** of the orbit $\gamma$. As $P_{\gamma}$ is a real [symplectic matrix](@entry_id:142706), its spectrum has a rigid structure: if $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue, then so are $\overline{\lambda}$, $\lambda^{-1}$, and $\overline{\lambda}^{-1}$. This implies that the eigenvalues come in pairs $(\lambda, \lambda^{-1})$ or quadruplets $(\lambda, \overline{\lambda}, \lambda^{-1}, \overline{\lambda}^{-1})$, and the product of all eigenvalues is $\det(P_{\gamma})=1$ .

The stability of the orbit is determined by the magnitude of its Floquet multipliers:
-   An orbit is **hyperbolic** (and linearly unstable) if it has any Floquet multiplier with magnitude $|\lambda| \neq 1$. The existence of a multiplier with $|\lambda|>1$ implies an exponentially expanding direction transverse to the orbit.
-   An orbit is **elliptic** or **spectrally stable** if all its Floquet multipliers lie on the unit circle in the complex plane, $|\lambda|=1$, and $P_{\gamma}$ is diagonalizable over $\mathbb{C}$. In this case, small perturbations remain bounded under the linearized dynamics .

#### Nondegeneracy and the Variational Perspective

A [periodic orbit](@entry_id:273755) $\gamma$ is called **nondegenerate** if $1$ is not an eigenvalue of the linearized return map $P_{\gamma}$. This is a generic condition, crucial for many results in contact topology, such as [counting orbits](@entry_id:142403) or applying [perturbation theory](@entry_id:138766).

It is essential to understand why [nondegeneracy](@entry_id:1128838) is defined on the restricted space $\xi$. The full linearized map $D\phi^T$ on $T_{\gamma(0)}M$ *always* has an eigenvalue of $1$, with the Reeb vector $R_{\alpha}(\gamma(0))$ itself as an eigenvector: $D\phi^T(R_{\alpha}(\gamma(0))) = R_{\alpha}(\phi^T(\gamma(0))) = R_{\alpha}(\gamma(0))$. Nondegeneracy requires that this is the *only* direction associated with the eigenvalue $1$. This is equivalent to requiring that no vector in the transverse direction $\xi$ is fixed by $P_{\gamma}$ .

This notion of [nondegeneracy](@entry_id:1128838) has a deep connection to [variational principles](@entry_id:198028). Periodic Reeb orbits can be characterized as critical points of an [action functional](@entry_id:169216) defined on the free [loop space](@entry_id:160867) of $M$. The functional is invariant under the time-shift action of $S^1$ on loops, meaning that each geometric orbit corresponds to a whole circle of critical points. The [nondegeneracy](@entry_id:1128838) condition for a Reeb orbit is the analogue of a Morse-Bott [nondegeneracy](@entry_id:1128838) condition for this [critical manifold](@entry_id:263391), meaning the Hessian of the [action functional](@entry_id:169216) is non-degenerate in directions transverse to the $S^1$ [symmetry group](@entry_id:138562) .

### Tools for Analyzing Reeb Dynamics

Moving beyond the local analysis of a single orbit requires more powerful tools that capture the global structure of the Reeb flow. In three dimensions, the method of surfaces of section, pioneered by Poincaré, is particularly effective.

#### Local Dynamics near Elliptic Orbits in 3D: Rotation Number and KAM Theory

In a [3-manifold](@entry_id:193484) $(M^3, \alpha)$, the contact plane $\xi$ is two-dimensional. The linearized return map $P_{\gamma}$ for a [periodic orbit](@entry_id:273755) $\gamma$ is an element of $\mathrm{Sp}(2, \mathbb{R}) \cong \mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{R})$. If the orbit is elliptic, its Floquet multipliers are a [complex conjugate pair](@entry_id:150139) $\{e^{i\theta}, e^{-i\theta}\}$ for some angle $\theta \in (0, 2\pi)$. This angle measures the rotation of the linearized dynamics in the transverse plane.

From this angle, we define the **transverse [rotation number](@entry_id:264186)** of the orbit as $\rho = \theta / (2\pi) \pmod 1$. This dimensionless quantity plays a central role in describing the nonlinear dynamics near the elliptic orbit.

The celebrated Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser (KAM) theorem applies here. It states that if the [rotation number](@entry_id:264186) $\rho$ is irrational (and satisfies a Diophantine condition, meaning it is not "too well" approximated by rationals), then the dynamics of the full nonlinear return map near the orbit is remarkably regular. A large set (of positive measure) of the concentric circles foliating the linearized dynamics will persist as invariant, quasi-periodic curves for the nonlinear map. These surviving curves form a Cantor set that traps nearby orbits, implying a strong form of long-term stability for the elliptic orbit .

#### Global Surfaces of Section and Area-Preserving Return Maps

A **global surface of section** for a Reeb flow on a [3-manifold](@entry_id:193484) $M$ is a compact, embedded surface $\Sigma \subset M$ that satisfies three key properties:
1.  Its boundary, $\partial\Sigma$, is a finite union of periodic Reeb orbits.
2.  The Reeb vector field $R_{\alpha}$ is everywhere transverse to the interior of the surface, $\mathrm{int}(\Sigma)$.
3.  Every Reeb orbit not contained in $\partial\Sigma$ intersects $\mathrm{int}(\Sigma)$ in both forward and backward time.

The existence of such a surface allows one to reduce the study of the continuous 3D flow to the iteration of a 2D discrete map. For any point $x \in \mathrm{int}(\Sigma)$, its trajectory under the Reeb flow will return to $\mathrm{int}(\Sigma)$ at some first positive time $\tau(x) > 0$. This defines the **first return map** $\mathcal{P}: \mathrm{int}(\Sigma) \to \mathrm{int}(\Sigma)$ by $\mathcal{P}(x) = \phi^{\tau(x)}(x)$.

A fundamental property of this map is that it is **area-preserving**. The natural area form on $\Sigma$ is the restriction of the 2-form $d\alpha$, i.e., $\omega = d\alpha|_{\Sigma}$. This form is non-degenerate (and thus an area form) precisely because $R_{\alpha}$, the kernel of $d\alpha$, is transverse to $\Sigma$. Since the Reeb flow $\phi^t$ preserves $d\alpha$, it follows that the return map $\mathcal{P}$ preserves the area form $\omega$. The proof involves showing that the pullback $\mathcal{P}^*\omega$ equals $\omega$, using the fact that the variable return time does not affect the calculation due to $\iota_{R_{\alpha}}d\alpha=0$ .

#### Finding More Orbits: The Poincaré–Birkhoff Theorem

The reduction to a 2D [area-preserving map](@entry_id:268016) is extremely powerful. When the surface of section $\Sigma$ is a disk (so its boundary $\partial\Sigma$ is a single [periodic orbit](@entry_id:273755)), the return map $\mathcal{P}$ is an [area-preserving map](@entry_id:268016) of the open disk. This sets the stage for applying the **Poincaré–Birkhoff Twist Theorem**.

This theorem concerns area-preserving maps of an [annulus](@entry_id:163678) $A = S^1 \times [0,1]$ that satisfy a **twist condition**: the map must rotate the inner and outer boundary circles by different amounts. If such a map exists, the theorem guarantees the existence of at least two periodic points for every rational [rotation number](@entry_id:264186) between the rotation numbers of the two boundaries.

In the context of the Reeb return map on a disk-like surface of section, we can construct such an [annulus](@entry_id:163678) $A \subset \mathrm{int}(\Sigma)$. The rotation rate of the map $\mathcal{P}$ typically varies with the distance from the boundary orbit $\partial\Sigma$. The rotation near $\partial\Sigma$ is governed by the linearized dynamics of the boundary orbit, while the rotation "far" from the boundary will generally be different. This variation in rotation allows one to find an [annulus](@entry_id:163678) where the twist condition is satisfied.

Applying the Poincaré–Birkhoff theorem then implies the existence of a plethora of periodic points for the return map $\mathcal{P}$. Each periodic point of $\mathcal{P}$ corresponds to a periodic orbit of the original Reeb flow. For instance, a point $x$ such that $\mathcal{P}^q(x) = x$ corresponds to a Reeb orbit that closes up after intersecting the surface of section $q$ times. In this way, the existence of one periodic orbit that bounds a global surface of section leads to the discovery of infinitely many others .

### Existence Theorems and Further Horizons

The tools described above are powerful for studying the structure of Reeb flows, but they often rely on strong initial assumptions, such as the existence of a global surface of section. A central question in the field is more fundamental: does a periodic Reeb orbit always exist?

#### The Weinstein Conjecture

This question was famously formulated as the **Weinstein conjecture**, which states that the Reeb vector field on any closed, co-oriented contact manifold must have at least one [periodic orbit](@entry_id:273755) . First posed in the 1970s, this conjecture has spurred decades of research and has been proven in many cases, including for all closed [3-manifolds](@entry_id:199026), through a variety of deep and sophisticated techniques.

#### Geometric Conditions for Existence: Dynamical Convexity

One fruitful line of inquiry has been to find geometric conditions on the [contact form](@entry_id:1122954) that guarantee not just the existence of orbits, but also a rich dynamical structure. On the 3-sphere $S^3$, a particularly important condition is **dynamical convexity**. A [contact form](@entry_id:1122954) $\alpha$ on $S^3$ is called dynamically convex if every contractible periodic Reeb orbit $\gamma$ has a Conley-Zehnder index $\mu_{\mathrm{CZ}}(\gamma) \geq 3$. The Conley-Zehnder index is an integer that measures the winding of the linearized flow in the transverse contact planes. The condition effectively rules out orbits that are "weakly" elliptic.

A landmark theorem by Hofer, Wysocki, and Zehnder (HWZ) states that if a [contact form](@entry_id:1122954) on $S^3$ is dynamically convex and non-degenerate, its Reeb flow admits a disk-like global surface of section . This result is remarkable because it provides a [sufficient condition](@entry_id:276242) for the existence of the very tool—the surface of section—that allows for the powerful analysis described previously, including the application of the Poincaré–Birkhoff theorem. An important source of dynamically convex contact forms comes from strictly convex [hypersurfaces](@entry_id:159491) in $(\mathbb{R}^4, \omega_{\mathrm{std}})$.

#### A Glimpse into Modern Methods: Taubes's Proof

The proof of the Weinstein conjecture in dimension three by Clifford Taubes represents a monumental achievement, connecting contact geometry to the world of [gauge theory](@entry_id:142992). Taubes's strategy involves studying the **Seiberg-Witten equations**, a system of coupled partial differential equations for a connection $A$ and a [spinor](@entry_id:154461) field $\psi$ on the [3-manifold](@entry_id:193484).

Taubes introduced a novel perturbation to these equations, adding a term proportional to the [contact form](@entry_id:1122954), $-ir\alpha$, where $r$ is a large real parameter. He showed that for a sequence of $r \to \infty$, solutions to these perturbed equations must exist, provided a certain [topological invariant](@entry_id:142028) (the Seiberg-Witten-Floer homology) of the manifold is non-trivial. The core of the proof is the asymptotic analysis of these solutions. As $r \to \infty$, the energy of the solutions concentrates along a 1-dimensional set. A careful analysis of the equations reveals that this limiting set is a union of [closed curves](@entry_id:264519) that are everywhere tangent to the Reeb vector field—in other words, a collection of periodic Reeb orbits . Since the limiting set is non-empty, the existence of at least one [periodic orbit](@entry_id:273755) is guaranteed.

#### Stability of Contact Structures

Finally, it is worth placing the study of different Reeb flows in context. A given contact structure $\xi$ can be represented by many different contact forms (e.g., $\alpha$ and $c\alpha$ for $c>0$, and many others). A natural question is how these different forms are related. **Gray's stability theorem** provides a powerful answer: if $\{\alpha_t\}_{t \in [0,1]}$ is a smooth family of contact forms on a closed manifold that all define the same [contact structure](@entry_id:635649) $\xi = \ker \alpha_t$, then there exists an isotopy $\phi_t$ (a smooth family of diffeomorphisms) such that $\phi_t^*\alpha_t$ is conformally equivalent to $\alpha_0$. That is, $\phi_t^*\alpha_t = g_t \alpha_0$ for some family of positive functions $g_t$. This means all contact forms for a given structure are, in a sense, equivalent up to [diffeomorphism](@entry_id:147249) and scaling. This result provides a framework for deforming contact forms while preserving the underlying structure, which is fundamental to many advanced techniques in the field .
