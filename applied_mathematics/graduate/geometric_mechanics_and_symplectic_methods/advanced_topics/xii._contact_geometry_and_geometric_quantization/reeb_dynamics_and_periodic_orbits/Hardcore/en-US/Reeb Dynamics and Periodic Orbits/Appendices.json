            "solution": "The problem asks for the components of the Reeb vector field $R_{\\alpha}$ for a given contact form $\\alpha$ on $\\mathbb{R}^3$, and for a geometric interpretation of its integral curves. We begin by validating the problem.\n\nAll given information is standard in contact geometry. The manifold is $M=\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with coordinates $(x,y,z)$. The $1$-form is $\\alpha=\\exp(z)\\big(dz+x\\,dy\\big)$. The Reeb vector field $R_{\\alpha}$ is uniquely defined by the conditions $\\alpha(R_{\\alpha})=1$ and $i_{R_{\\alpha}}d\\alpha=0$. For $R_{\\alpha}$ to be well-defined, $\\alpha$ must be a contact form, meaning $\\alpha \\wedge d\\alpha$ must be a volume form (nowhere zero). Let's verify this.\nFirst, we compute $d\\alpha$:\n$$d\\alpha = d(\\exp(z)dz + x\\exp(z)dy) = d(\\exp(z))\\wedge dz + d(x\\exp(z))\\wedge dy$$\n$$d\\alpha = \\exp(z)dz \\wedge dz + (\\exp(z)dx + x\\exp(z)dz) \\wedge dy$$\n$$d\\alpha = 0 + \\exp(z)dx \\wedge dy + x\\exp(z)dz \\wedge dy = \\exp(z)dx \\wedge dy - x\\exp(z)dy \\wedge dz$$\nNext, we compute the wedge product $\\alpha \\wedge d\\alpha$:\n$$\\alpha \\wedge d\\alpha = (\\exp(z)dz + x\\exp(z)dy) \\wedge (\\exp(z)dx \\wedge dy - x\\exp(z)dy \\wedge dz)$$\n$$= \\exp(z)dz \\wedge (\\exp(z)dx \\wedge dy) + x\\exp(z)dy \\wedge (\\exp(z)dx \\wedge dy) - \\exp(z)dz \\wedge (x\\exp(z)dy \\wedge dz) - x\\exp(z)dy \\wedge (x\\exp(z)dy \\wedge dz)$$\nTerms with repeated $1$-forms vanish, so we are left with:\n$$\\alpha \\wedge d\\alpha = \\exp(2z) dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy = -\\exp(2z) dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$$\nSince $\\exp(2z)$ is never zero on $\\mathbb{R}^3$, $\\alpha \\wedge d\\alpha$ is a volume form. Thus, $\\alpha$ is a valid contact form, and the Reeb vector field $R_{\\alpha}$ is well-defined. The problem is valid.\n\nLet the Reeb vector field in the coordinate frame $\\{\\partial_{x},\\partial_{y},\\partial_{z}\\}$ be $R_{\\alpha} = A(x,y,z)\\partial_{x} + B(x,y,z)\\partial_{y} + C(x,y,z)\\partial_{z}$. We will determine the functions $A$, $B$, and $C$ using the defining conditions.\n\nFirst condition: $\\alpha(R_{\\alpha})=1$.\n$$\\alpha(R_{\\alpha}) = (\\exp(z)dz + x\\exp(z)dy)(A\\partial_{x} + B\\partial_{y} + C\\partial_{z})$$\n$$= A\\cdot\\alpha(\\partial_{x}) + B\\cdot\\alpha(\\partial_{y}) + C\\cdot\\alpha(\\partial_{z})$$\n$$= A\\cdot 0 + B(x\\exp(z)) + C(\\exp(z)) = \\exp(z)(Bx+C)$$\nSo, we have our first equation:\n$$\\exp(z)(Bx+C) = 1 \\quad (*)$$\n\nSecond condition: $d\\alpha(R_{\\alpha}, \\cdot)=0$, which is equivalent to the interior product $i_{R_{\\alpha}}d\\alpha=0$.\nWe have $d\\alpha = \\exp(z)dx \\wedge dy - x\\exp(z)dy \\wedge dz$.\n$$i_{R_{\\alpha}}d\\alpha = i_{A\\partial_{x} + B\\partial_{y} + C\\partial_{z}}d\\alpha = A(i_{\\partial_{x}}d\\alpha) + B(i_{\\partial_{y}}d\\alpha) + C(i_{\\partial_{z}}d\\alpha)$$\nWe compute the individual interior products:\n$$i_{\\partial_{x}}d\\alpha = i_{\\partial_{x}}(\\exp(z)dx \\wedge dy - x\\exp(z)dy \\wedge dz) = \\exp(z)dy$$\n$$i_{\\partial_{y}}d\\alpha = i_{\\partial_{y}}(\\exp(z)dx \\wedge dy - x\\exp(z)dy \\wedge dz) = -\\exp(z)dx - x\\exp(z)dz$$\n$$i_{\\partial_{z}}d\\alpha = i_{\\partial_{z}}(\\exp(z)dx \\wedge dy - x\\exp(z)dy \\wedge dz) = x\\exp(z)dy$$\nSubstituting these back:\n$$i_{R_{\\alpha}}d\\alpha = A(\\exp(z)dy) + B(-\\exp(z)dx - x\\exp(z)dz) + C(x\\exp(z)dy)$$\n$$= -B\\exp(z)dx + (A\\exp(z) + Cx\\exp(z))dy - Bx\\exp(z)dz$$\nFor this $1$-form to be zero, all its components must be zero.\nFrom the $dx$ component: $-B\\exp(z) = 0 \\implies B=0$.\nFrom the $dy$ component: $A\\exp(z) + Cx\\exp(z) = 0 \\implies A+Cx = 0 \\implies A = -Cx$.\nThe $dz$ component, $-Bx\\exp(z) = 0$, is consistent with $B=0$.\n\nWe now have a system of algebraic equations for $A$, $B$, $C$:\n$1$. $B=0$\n$2$. $A=-Cx$\n$3$. $\\exp(z)(Bx+C) = 1$\n\nSubstitute $B=0$ into the third equation:\n$\\exp(z)(0 \\cdot x + C) = 1 \\implies C\\exp(z) = 1 \\implies C = \\exp(-z)$.\nNow substitute $C=\\exp(-z)$ into the second equation:\n$A = -(\\exp(-z))x = -x\\exp(-z)$.\n\nThe components of the Reeb vector field are $A = -x\\exp(-z)$, $B=0$, and $C=\\exp(-z)$.\nSo, $R_{\\alpha} = -x\\exp(-z)\\partial_{x} + \\exp(-z)\\partial_{z}$.\n\n(a) We are asked to compute the components of $R_{\\alpha}$ at the point $p=(1,2,0)$.\nWe substitute $x=1, y=2, z=0$ into the expressions for $A, B, C$.\n$A(1,2,0) = -1 \\cdot \\exp(-0) = -1$.\n$B(1,2,0) = 0$.\n$C(1,2,0) = \\exp(-0) = 1$.\nThe components of $R_{\\alpha}(p)$ are $(-1, 0, 1)$.\n\n(b) The integral curves of $R_{\\alpha}$ are the solutions $(x(t), y(t), z(t))$ to the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n$$\\frac{dx}{dt} = A = -x\\exp(-z)$$\n$$\\frac{dy}{dt} = B = 0$$\n$$\\frac{dz}{dt} = C = \\exp(-z)$$\nFrom the second equation, $y(t) = y_0$ for some constant $y_0$, meaning the flow lines are contained in planes of constant $y$. To find a relation between $x$ and $z$, we can examine the projection of the flow onto the $xz$-plane. The chain rule gives:\n$$\\frac{dx}{dz} = \\frac{dx/dt}{dz/dt} = \\frac{-x\\exp(-z)}{\\exp(-z)} = -x$$\nThis is a separable ODE: $\\frac{dx}{x} = -dz$. Integrating both sides gives:\n$$\\ln|x| = -z + K$$\nwhere $K$ is a constant of integration. We can rewrite this relation as $|x|\\exp(z) = \\exp(K)$, which is a constant. For a trajectory passing near the point $p=(1,2,0)$, we have $x>0$, so the relation is $x\\exp(z) = \\text{constant}$. This is a nontrivial relation between $x$ and $z$ that is preserved along the integral curves of $R_{\\alpha}$.",

All definitions and concepts used are fundamental to these fields. The irrational ellipsoid is a classic and well-studied example.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly stated with all necessary definitions and conditions for a unique solution. The irrationality condition is a key constraint that determines the structure of the action spectrum.\n- **Objective:** The problem is formulated in precise mathematical language, free from any subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Reeb Dynamics**\nThe boundary $\\Sigma$ of the ellipsoid $E(a,b)$ is the level set where the Hamiltonian $H(z)=1$. The contact form is $\\alpha = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{std}}|_{\\Sigma}$. Its exterior derivative is $d\\alpha = d(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{std}})|_{\\Sigma}$. Since $d\\lambda_{\\mathrm{std}} = \\omega_0$, we have $d\\alpha = \\omega_0|_{\\Sigma}$.\n\nThe Reeb vector field $R$ is defined on $\\Sigma$ by two conditions:\n$1.$ $\\alpha(R)=1$ (normalization)\n$2.$ $\\iota_R d\\alpha = 0$ (kernel condition)\nThe second condition, written as $d\\alpha(R, \\cdot) = 0$ or $\\iota_R \\omega_0|_{\\Sigma}=0$, implies that $R$ must be symplectically orthogonal to the tangent space of $\\Sigma$. In a general symplectic manifold, the symplectic orthogonal complement of the tangent space of a regular energy surface is spanned by the Hamiltonian vector field.\n\nLet us compute the Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ for $H(z) = \\pi\\left(\\frac{|z_{1}|^{2}}{a}+\\frac{|z_{2}|^{2}}{b}\\right)$. In real coordinates where $z_j = x_j + i y_j$, we have $H(x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2) = \\pi\\left(\\frac{x_1^2+y_1^2}{a} + \\frac{x_2^2+y_2^2}{b}\\right)$.\nThe Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ is defined by $\\iota_{X_H}\\omega_0 = dH$.\nThe differential of $H$ is $dH = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}(x_1 dx_1 + y_1 dy_1) + \\frac{2\\pi}{b}(x_2 dx_2 + y_2 dy_2)$.\nWith $\\omega_0 = dx_1 \\wedge dy_1 + dx_2 \\wedge dy_2$, the equation $\\iota_{X_H}\\omega_0 = dH$ gives Hamilton's equations:\n$\\dot{x}_j = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y_j}$ and $\\dot{y}_j = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x_j}$.\nFor $j=1$: $\\dot{x}_1 = \\frac{2\\pi}{a} y_1$ and $\\dot{y}_1 = -\\frac{2\\pi}{a} x_1$.\nFor $j=2$: $\\dot{x}_2 = \\frac{2\\pi}{b} y_2$ and $\\dot{y}_2 = -\\frac{2\\pi}{b} x_2$.\nIn complex coordinates, this is $\\dot{z}_1 = \\dot{x}_1 + i\\dot{y}_1 = -i\\frac{2\\pi}{a} z_1$ and $\\dot{z}_2 = \\dot{x}_2 + i\\dot{y}_2 = -i\\frac{2\\pi}{b} z_2$.\nThe vector field is $X_H = \\sum_{j=1}^2 \\left( \\frac{2\\pi y_j}{a_j}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} - \\frac{2\\pi x_j}{a_j}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_j} \\right)$, with $a_1=a, a_2=b$.\n\nThe Reeb vector field $R$ is proportional to $X_H$ on $\\Sigma$, i.e., $R = c X_H$ for some function $c$ on $\\Sigma$. To find $c$, we use the normalization condition $\\alpha(R)=1$.\nLet's compute $\\alpha(X_H)$:\n$$ \\alpha(X_H) = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{std}}(X_H) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j=1}^{2}(x_{j}\\dot{y}_{j}-y_{j}\\dot{x}_{j}) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\dot{x}_j$ and $\\dot{y}_j$:\n$$ \\alpha(X_H) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ x_1\\left(-\\frac{2\\pi}{a}x_1\\right) - y_1\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}y_1\\right) + x_2\\left(-\\frac{2\\pi}{b}x_2\\right) - y_2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{b}y_2\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ \\alpha(X_H) = -\\pi \\left( \\frac{x_1^2+y_1^2}{a} + \\frac{x_2^2+y_2^2}{b} \\right) = -H(z) $$\nOn the surface $\\Sigma$, $H(z)=1$, so $\\alpha(X_H)|_{\\Sigma} = -1$.\nThe normalization condition becomes $\\alpha(R) = c \\alpha(X_H) = c(-1) = 1$, which implies $c=-1$.\nThus, the Reeb vector field $R$ on $\\Sigma$ is opposite to the Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ restricted to $\\Sigma$: $R = -X_H|_{\\Sigma}$.\n\nThe Reeb flow $\\phi_t^R$ is given by the solution to the ODEs for $R$, which in complex coordinates gives:\n$$ z_1(t) = z_1(0)\\exp\\left(i\\frac{2\\pi}{a}t\\right) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad z_2(t) = z_2(0)\\exp\\left(i\\frac{2\\pi}{b}t\\right) $$\n\n**Simple Closed Reeb Orbits and their Actions**\nA periodic orbit is a trajectory that returns to its starting point after some time $T>0$.\nThe two simple closed orbits correspond to motions confined to the complex coordinate axes.\n1. The first orbit, $\\gamma_1$, lies on the $z_1$-axis ($z_2=0$). The initial condition $(z_{1,0}, 0)$ must lie on $\\Sigma$, so $\\pi\\frac{|z_{1,0}|^2}{a}=1$, which means $|z_{1,0}| = \\sqrt{a/\\pi}$. The orbit is $\\gamma_1(t) = (\\sqrt{a/\\pi}\\exp(i\\frac{2\\pi}{a}t), 0)$. This orbit closes when $\\frac{2\\pi}{a}T_1 = 2\\pi k$ for some integer $k$. The minimal period is for $k=1$, which gives $T_1=a$. The action of this orbit is $\\mathcal{A}(\\gamma_1) = \\int_0^{T_1} \\alpha(R(\\gamma_1(t))) dt = \\int_0^a 1 dt = a$.\n\n2. The second orbit, $\\gamma_2$, lies on the $z_2$-axis ($z_1=0$). The initial condition $(0, z_{2,0})$ must lie on $\\Sigma$, so $\\pi\\frac{|z_{2,0}|^2}{b}=1$, which means $|z_{2,0}| = \\sqrt{b/\\pi}$. The orbit is $\\gamma_2(t) = (0, \\sqrt{b/\\pi}\\exp(i\\frac{2\\pi}{b}t))$. The minimal period is $T_2=b$. The action is $\\mathcal{A}(\\gamma_2) = \\int_0^b 1 dt = b$.\n\n**Action Spectrum and Irrationality**\nA general orbit starting at $(z_1, z_2)$ is periodic with period $T$ if $z_j(T) = z_j(0)$ for $j=1,2$. This requires $\\exp(i\\frac{2\\pi}{a}T)=1$ and $\\exp(i\\frac{2\\pi}{b}T)=1$ (unless one of the initial components is zero). This means $T = k_1 a$ and $T=k_2 b$ for some integers $k_1, k_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. This would imply $\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{k_2}{k_1} \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. However, the problem states that $\\frac{a}{b}$ is irrational. Therefore, no such orbit exists where both $z_1(0)$ and $z_2(0)$ are non-zero. The only periodic orbits are the ones where one component is zero, i.e., the simple orbits described above and their iterates.\n\nThe iterates of $\\gamma_1$ are the orbit traversed $k$ times, with $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$. Their periods, and hence actions, are $k a$.\nThe iterates of $\\gamma_2$ are the orbit traversed $m$ times, with $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$. Their actions are $m b$.\nThe condition $\\frac{a}{b} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$ ensures that $ka \\neq mb$ for any $k, m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$.\nThus, the action spectrum (the set of all possible actions of periodic orbits) is the disjoint union:\n$$ \\mathrm{Spec}(\\Sigma, \\alpha) = \\{ ka \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+ \\} \\cup \\{ mb \\mid m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+ \\} $$\n\n**Final Calculation**\nWe need to find the number $N(T)$ of distinct periodic Reeb orbits whose action is less than or equal to $T=9$, for $a=\\sqrt{2}$ and $b=\\sqrt{7}$.\nEach value in the action spectrum corresponds to a unique periodic orbit (in the sense requested by the problem, which counts iterates).\nWe need to count how many positive integers $k$ satisfy $k a \\leq T$ and how many positive integers $m$ satisfy $m b \\leq T$.\n\nFor the first family of orbits (based on $\\gamma_1$):\n$$ k\\sqrt{2} \\leq 9 \\implies k \\leq \\frac{9}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{9\\sqrt{2}}{2} $$\nSince $1.414 < \\sqrt{2} < 1.415$, we have $6.363 < \\frac{9\\sqrt{2}}{2} < 6.367$.\nThe number of positive integers $k$ satisfying $k \\leq 6.36...$ is $\\lfloor \\frac{9}{\\sqrt{2}} \\rfloor = 6$. These correspond to actions $\\sqrt{2}, 2\\sqrt{2}, 3\\sqrt{2}, 4\\sqrt{2}, 5\\sqrt{2}, 6\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nFor the second family of orbits (based on $\\gamma_2$):\n$$ m\\sqrt{7} \\leq 9 \\implies m \\leq \\frac{9}{\\sqrt{7}} = \\frac{9\\sqrt{7}}{7} $$\nSince $2.645 < \\sqrt{7} < 2.646$, we have $3.400 < \\frac{9\\sqrt{7}}{7} < 3.402$.\nThe number of positive integers $m$ satisfying $m \\leq 3.40...$ is $\\lfloor \\frac{9}{\\sqrt{7}} \\rfloor = 3$. These correspond to actions $\\sqrt{7}, 2\\sqrt{7}, 3\\sqrt{7}$.\n\nThe total number of distinct periodic Reeb orbits with action $\\leq 9$ is the sum of these two counts, as the action sets are disjoint.\n$$ N(T) = N(9) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{9}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{9}{\\sqrt{7}} \\right\\rfloor = 6 + 3 = 9 $$",

I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe ellipsoid $E(a,b)$ is the level set $H=1$ of the Hamiltonian function $H(z_1, z_2) = \\frac{|z_1|^2}{a} + \\frac{|z_2|^2}{b}$. In real coordinates $z_j = x_j + \\mathrm{i}y_j$, this is $H(x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2) = \\frac{x_1^2+y_1^2}{a} + \\frac{x_2^2+y_2^2}{b}$. The Liouville form is $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j=1}^{2} (x_j \\mathrm{d}y_j - y_j \\mathrm{d}x_j)$. The standard symplectic form on $\\mathbb{R}^4$ is $\\omega = \\mathrm{d}\\lambda = \\sum_{j=1}^{2} \\mathrm{d}x_j \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y_j$.\n\nThe Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ on $(\\mathbb{R}^4, \\omega)$ is defined by the condition $\\iota_{X_H}\\omega = \\mathrm{d}H$. With the standard complex structure $J$ on $\\mathbb{R}^4 \\cong \\mathbb{C}^2$, $X_H = J\\nabla H$. The gradient of $H$ is $\\nabla H = (\\frac{2x_1}{a}, \\frac{2y_1}{a}, \\frac{2x_2}{b}, \\frac{2y_2}{b})$. Applying $J(v_x, v_y) = (-v_y, v_x)$ to each pair of coordinates, we get the components of $X_H$:\n$$\n\\dot{x}_1 = -\\frac{2y_1}{a}, \\quad \\dot{y}_1 = \\frac{2x_1}{a}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{x}_2 = -\\frac{2y_2}{b}, \\quad \\dot{y}_2 = \\frac{2x_2}{b}\n$$\nIn complex coordinates, these equations become:\n$$\n\\dot{z}_1 = \\dot{x}_1 + \\mathrm{i}\\dot{y}_1 = -\\frac{2y_1}{a} + \\mathrm{i}\\frac{2x_1}{a} = \\frac{2\\mathrm{i}}{a}(x_1 + \\mathrm{i}y_1) = \\frac{2\\mathrm{i}}{a}z_1\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{z}_2 = \\dot{x}_2 + \\mathrm{i}\\dot{y}_2 = -\\frac{2y_2}{b} + \\mathrm{i}\\frac{2x_2}{b} = \\frac{2\\mathrm{i}}{b}(x_2 + \\mathrm{i}y_2) = \\frac{2\\mathrm{i}}{b}z_2\n$$\nThe Reeb vector field $R_{\\alpha}$ on $E(a,b)$ is uniquely defined by the conditions:\n$1$. $\\alpha(R_{\\alpha}) = 1$\n$2$. $\\mathrm{d}\\alpha(R_{\\alpha}, \\cdot) = 0$\n\nLet's check if the Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$, when restricted to the ellipsoid $E(a,b)$, is proportional to the Reeb vector field. The contact form is $\\alpha = \\lambda|_{E(a,b)}$ and its exterior derivative is $\\mathrm{d}\\alpha = \\omega|_{E(a,b)}$.\nThe second condition becomes $\\omega(X_H, V) = 0$ for any vector $V$ tangent to $E(a,b)$. From the definition of $X_H$, we have $\\omega(X_H, V) = \\mathrm{d}H(V)$. Since $V$ is tangent to a level set of $H$, $\\mathrm{d}H(V) = 0$ by definition. So the second condition implies $X_H$ is in the kernel of $\\mathrm{d}\\alpha$, and thus proportional to $R_\\alpha$.\nFor the first condition, we compute $\\lambda(X_H)$:\n$$\n\\lambda(X_H) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j=1}^{2} (x_j \\dot{y}_j - y_j \\dot{x}_j) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left(x_1\\frac{2x_1}{a} - y_1\\frac{-2y_1}{a}\\right) + \\left(x_2\\frac{2x_2}{b} - y_2\\frac{-2y_2}{b}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda(X_H) = \\frac{x_1^2+y_1^2}{a} + \\frac{x_2^2+y_2^2}{b} = \\frac{|z_1|^2}{a} + \\frac{|z_2|^2}{b} = H(z_1, z_2)\n$$\nOn the ellipsoid $E(a,b)$, we have $H=1$, so $\\lambda(X_H)=1$. The Hamiltonian flow is a reparametrization of the Reeb flow: $X_H = \\lambda(X_H) R_\\alpha = H R_\\alpha$. On the surface $E(a,b)$, $H=1$, so $R_\\alpha = X_H$.\nThe Reeb dynamics are governed by the ODEs $\\dot{z}_1 = \\frac{2\\mathrm{i}}{a}z_1$ and $\\dot{z}_2 = \\frac{2\\mathrm{i}}{b}z_2$. The solution is:\n$$\nz_1(t) = z_1(0)\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\mathrm{i}t}{a}\\right), \\quad z_2(t) = z_2(0)\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\mathrm{i}t}{b}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe two simple periodic orbits lie on the complex coordinate planes.\nOrbit 1, $\\gamma_1$: Let $z_2=0$. The ellipsoid equation gives $\\frac{|z_1|^2}{a}=1$, so $|z_1|=\\sqrt{a}$. This is a periodic orbit with period $T_1$ such that $\\frac{2T_1}{a} = 2\\pi$, which yields $T_1 = \\pi a$.\n\nOrbit 2, $\\gamma_2$: Let $z_1=0$. The ellipsoid equation gives $\\frac{|z_2|^2}{b}=1$, so $|z_2|=\\sqrt{b}$. This is a periodic orbit with period $T_2$ such that $\\frac{2T_2}{b} = 2\\pi$, which yields $T_2 = \\pi b$.\n\nNow, we analyze the linearized flow around each orbit.\n\n**Analysis of Orbit $\\gamma_1$ ($z_2=0$)**\nA point on this orbit is, for example, $p_1 = (\\sqrt{a}, 0)$. The flow direction is tangent to the $z_1$-plane. A local transverse section $\\Sigma_1$ can be parameterized by the coordinate $z_2$ for $|z_2|$ small. To compute the first return map, we evolve a point near $\\gamma_1$ for one period $T_1 = \\pi a$. The flow map $\\Phi_t(z_1, z_2)$ after time $T_1$ is:\n$$\n\\Phi_{T_1}(z_1, z_2) = \\left(z_1\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\mathrm{i}(\\pi a)}{a}\\right), z_2\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\mathrm{i}(\\pi a)}{b}\\right)\\right) = \\left(z_1\\exp(2\\pi\\mathrm{i}), z_2\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi\\mathrm{i}a}{b}\\right)\\right) = \\left(z_1, z_2\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi\\mathrm{i}a}{b}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThe first return map $P_1$ acts on the transverse coordinate $z_2$ as a multiplication by a complex phase. Identifying the tangent space of the section with $\\mathbb{C}$, the map is $P_1: z_2 \\mapsto z_2 \\exp(\\frac{2\\pi\\mathrm{i}a}{b})$. This is a linear map, representing a rotation in the $(x_2, y_2)$-plane.\nThe eigenvalues of this map (seen as a transformation on $\\mathbb{R}^2$) are $\\exp(\\pm \\frac{2\\pi\\mathrm{i}a}{b})$. Since $\\frac{a}{b}$ is irrational, these eigenvalues lie on the unit circle but are not equal to $1$ or $-1$. Therefore, the orbit $\\gamma_1$ is **elliptic**.\nThe rotation angle is $\\theta_1 = \\frac{2\\pi a}{b}$ radians. The rotation number $\\rho_1$ is this angle divided by $2\\pi$:\n$$\n\\rho_1 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi a}{b}\\right) = \\frac{a}{b}\n$$\n\n**Analysis of Orbit $\\gamma_2$ ($z_1=0$)**\nThe analysis is symmetric to the first case. We consider the flow for one period $T_2 = \\pi b$:\n$$\n\\Phi_{T_2}(z_1, z_2) = \\left(z_1\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\mathrm{i}(\\pi b)}{a}\\right), z_2\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\mathrm{i}(\\pi b)}{b}\\right)\\right) = \\left(z_1\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi\\mathrm{i}b}{a}\\right), z_2\\exp(2\\pi\\mathrm{i})\\right) = \\left(z_1\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi\\mathrm{i}b}{a}\\right), z_2\\right)\n$$\nThe transverse coordinate is now $z_1$. The first return map $P_2$ on a transverse section $\\Sigma_2$ is $P_2: z_1 \\mapsto z_1\\exp(\\frac{2\\pi\\mathrm{i}b}{a})$. This is a rotation in the $(x_1, y_1)$-plane with eigenvalues $\\exp(\\pm \\frac{2\\pi\\mathrm{i}b}{a})$. Since $\\frac{b}{a}$ is also irrational, the orbit $\\gamma_2$ is **elliptic**.\nThe rotation angle is $\\theta_2 = \\frac{2\\pi b}{a}$ radians. The rotation number $\\rho_2$ is:\n$$\n\\rho_2 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi b}{a}\\right) = \\frac{b}{a}\n$$\n\n**Sum of Rotation Numbers**\nThe problem asks for the sum of the rotation numbers of the two simple periodic orbits:\n$$\n\\rho_1 + \\rho_2 = \\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{b}{a}\n$$\nThis is the final expression.",
