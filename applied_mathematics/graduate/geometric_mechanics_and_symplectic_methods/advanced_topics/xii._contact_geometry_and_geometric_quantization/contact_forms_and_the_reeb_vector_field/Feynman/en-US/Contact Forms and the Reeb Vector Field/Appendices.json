This makes $\\alpha$ a contact form. The Reeb vector field $R_{\\alpha}$ associated to $\\alpha$ is the unique vector field characterized by the conditions $\\alpha(R_{\\alpha})=1$ and $\\iota_{R_{\\alpha}}(d\\alpha)=0$, where $\\iota_{X}$ denotes the interior product (contraction) with a vector field $X$.

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded in the field of differential geometry, specifically contact geometry. All terms are standard and the premises are consistent. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of the interior product $\\iota_{R_{\\alpha}}(\\alpha \\wedge d\\alpha)$, where $\\alpha$ is a contact $1$-form on a $3$-manifold $M$ and $R_{\\alpha}$ is its corresponding Reeb vector field. The Reeb vector field is uniquely defined by the two conditions:\n$1.$ $\\alpha(R_{\\alpha}) = 1$\n$2.$ $\\iota_{R_{\\alpha}}(d\\alpha) = 0$\n\nTo compute the contraction, we use the property that the interior product acts as a graded derivation on the algebra of differential forms. For a vector field $X$, a $k$-form $\\omega$, and any form $\\eta$, this property is expressed by the formula:\n$$\\iota_X(\\omega \\wedge \\eta) = (\\iota_X\\omega) \\wedge \\eta + (-1)^k \\omega \\wedge (\\iota_X\\eta)$$\n\nIn our specific case, the vector field is $X = R_{\\alpha}$, the first form is $\\omega = \\alpha$, and the second form is $\\eta = d\\alpha$. Since $\\alpha$ is a $1$-form, the degree is $k=1$. Applying the formula, we have:\n$$\\iota_{R_{\\alpha}}(\\alpha \\wedge d\\alpha) = (\\iota_{R_{\\alpha}}\\alpha) \\wedge d\\alpha + (-1)^1 \\alpha \\wedge (\\iota_{R_{\\alpha}}d\\alpha)$$\n$$\\iota_{R_{\\alpha}}(\\alpha \\wedge d\\alpha) = (\\iota_{R_{\\alpha}}\\alpha) \\wedge d\\alpha - \\alpha \\wedge (\\iota_{R_{\\alpha}}d\\alpha)$$\n\nNow we evaluate each of the two terms on the right-hand side using the defining properties of the Reeb vector field $R_{\\alpha}$.\n\nFor the first term, we evaluate $(\\iota_{R_{\\alpha}}\\alpha)$. The interior product of a $1$-form with a vector field is, by definition, the evaluation of the $1$-form on the vector field, which results in a scalar function (a $0$-form).\n$$\\iota_{R_{\\alpha}}\\alpha = \\alpha(R_{\\alpha})$$\nFrom the first defining property of the Reeb vector field, we are given $\\alpha(R_{\\alpha}) = 1$. Therefore:\n$$\\iota_{R_{\\alpha}}\\alpha = 1$$\nSubstituting this back into the first term, we get:\n$$(\\iota_{R_{\\alpha}}\\alpha) \\wedge d\\alpha = 1 \\wedge d\\alpha = d\\alpha$$\nHere, the wedge product of a scalar function (a $0$-form) with any other form is simply scalar multiplication.\n\nFor the second term, we evaluate $\\alpha \\wedge (\\iota_{R_{\\alpha}}d\\alpha)$. The second defining property of the Reeb vector field is precisely:\n$$\\iota_{R_{\\alpha}}(d\\alpha) = 0$$\nNote that since $d\\alpha$ is a $2$-form, its contraction with a vector field $R_{\\alpha}$ results in a $1$-form. So, the $0$ on the right-hand side represents the zero $1$-form.\nSubstituting this into the second term of our main expression gives:\n$$\\alpha \\wedge (\\iota_{R_{\\alpha}}d\\alpha) = \\alpha \\wedge 0 = 0$$\nThe wedge product of any form with the zero form is the zero form.\n\nCombining the results for both terms, we find the final expression for the contraction:\n$$\\iota_{R_{\\alpha}}(\\alpha \\wedge d\\alpha) = d\\alpha - 0 = d\\alpha$$\n\nThe problem also asks for an explanation of how this result identifies $\\alpha \\wedge d\\alpha$ as the wedge of $\\alpha$ with the contracted form $\\iota_{R_{\\alpha}}(\\alpha \\wedge d\\alpha)$.\nOur calculation has shown that $\\iota_{R_{\\alpha}}(\\alpha \\wedge d\\alpha) = d\\alpha$. If we take the wedge product of $\\alpha$ with this result, we get:\n$$\\alpha \\wedge \\left( \\iota_{R_{\\alpha}}(\\alpha \\wedge d\\alpha) \\right) = \\alpha \\wedge d\\alpha$$\nThis is an identity that directly confirms the relationship requested. The volume form $\\alpha \\wedge d\\alpha$ is reconstructed by taking the wedge product of the contact form $\\alpha$ with the result of contracting the volume form itself by the Reeb field. This shows how the volume form is fundamentally tied to its behavior under contraction with $R_\\alpha$. Geometrically, the tangent space at any point can be decomposed into the direction of the Reeb field and the contact hyperplane $\\xi = \\ker(\\alpha)$. The contraction $\\iota_{R_{\\alpha}}$ effectively isolates the component of the volume form that lives on this hyperplane, which is the $2$-form $d\\alpha$. Wedging this $2$-form with the original contact form $\\alpha$ (which picks out the Reeb field direction, since $\\alpha(R_\\alpha)=1$) reconstructs the full volume form.",

We must determine where it fails to be a contact form and find its associated Reeb vector field on the domain where it is contact.\n\nFirst, we compute the exterior derivative, $d\\alpha$. The exterior derivative of a $1$-form $A = A_x dx + A_y dy + A_z dz$ is given by $d A = (\\frac{\\partial A_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial A_x}{\\partial y}) dx \\wedge dy + (\\frac{\\partial A_z}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial A_y}{\\partial z}) dy \\wedge dz + (\\frac{\\partial A_x}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial A_z}{\\partial x}) dz \\wedge dx$.\nAlternatively, using the product rule for forms, $d(fg) = df \\wedge g + f \\wedge dg$, and the fact that $d(dx)=d(dy)=d(dz)=0$:\n$$\nd\\alpha = d(z\\,dx + x\\,dy + y\\,dz) = d(z) \\wedge dx + z \\wedge d(dx) + d(x) \\wedge dy + x \\wedge d(dy) + d(y) \\wedge dz + y \\wedge d(dz)\n$$\nSince $d(x)=dx$, $d(y)=dy$, $d(z)=dz$, and $d(d\\phi)=0$ for any $0$-form $\\phi$, this simplifies to:\n$$\nd\\alpha = dz \\wedge dx + dx \\wedge dy + dy \\wedge dz\n$$\nUsing the anti-commutative property of the wedge product (e.g., $dz \\wedge dx = -dx \\wedge dz$), we can write this in the standard ordered basis:\n$$\nd\\alpha = dx \\wedge dy + dy \\wedge dz + dz \\wedge dx\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the $3$-form $\\alpha \\wedge d\\alpha$.\n$$\n\\alpha \\wedge d\\alpha = (z\\,dx + x\\,dy + y\\,dz) \\wedge (dx \\wedge dy + dy \\wedge dz + dz \\wedge dx)\n$$\nWe expand this product, recalling that any wedge product containing a repeated $1$-form is zero (e.g., $dx \\wedge dx = 0$). This implies terms like $dx \\wedge (dx \\wedge dy)$ are zero.\nThe non-vanishing terms are:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item $z\\,dx \\wedge (dy \\wedge dz) = z\\,dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$\n    \\item $x\\,dy \\wedge (dz \\wedge dx) = x\\,dy \\wedge dz \\wedge dx$\n    \\item $y\\,dz \\wedge (dx \\wedge dy) = y\\,dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy$\n\\end{enumerate}\nAll other terms in the expansion, such as $z\\,dx \\wedge (dx \\wedge dy)$, $z\\,dx \\wedge (dz \\wedge dx)$, $x\\,dy \\wedge (dx \\wedge dy)$, etc., are zero.\nWe use the cyclic permutation property of the volume form: $dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = dy \\wedge dz \\wedge dx = dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy$.\nApplying this to the non-vanishing terms:\n$$\nx\\,dy \\wedge dz \\wedge dx = x\\,dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$\n$$\ny\\,dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy = y\\,dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$\nSumming the three terms, we obtain:\n$$\n\\alpha \\wedge d\\alpha = z\\,dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + x\\,dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + y\\,dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = (x+y+z)\\,dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$\nThe problem states that $\\alpha \\wedge d\\alpha = f(x,y,z)\\,dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$.

In our case, $\\alpha \\wedge d\\alpha$ vanishes when $f(x,y,z) = x+y+z=0$. This equation defines a plane in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ passing through the origin with normal vector $(1,1,1)$. This is the degeneracy locus. Because this locus is a non-empty subset of $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the form $\\alpha$ fails to be a contact form on all of $\\mathbb{R}^3$. It is, however, a contact form on the open set $U = \\{(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid x+y+z \\neq 0\\}$, which is the complement of the degeneracy plane.\n\nFinally, we find the Reeb vector field $R$ on the domain $U$. Let $R$ be represented in the coordinate basis as $R = R_x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + R_y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + R_z \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$.

We compute the interior product:\n$$\n\\iota_R d\\alpha = \\iota_R(dx \\wedge dy) + \\iota_R(dy \\wedge dz) + \\iota_R(dz \\wedge dx)\n$$\nUsing the rule $\\iota_V(\\beta \\wedge \\gamma) = (\\iota_V \\beta)\\gamma - (\\iota_V \\gamma)\\beta$ for $1$-forms $\\beta, \\gamma$:\n$$\n\\iota_R(dx \\wedge dy) = (\\iota_R dx)dy - (\\iota_R dy)dx = R_x dy - R_y dx\n$$\n$$\n\\iota_R(dy \\wedge dz) = (\\iota_R dy)dz - (\\iota_R dz)dy = R_y dz - R_z dy\n$$\n$$\n\\iota_R(dz \\wedge dx) = (\\iota_R dz)dx - (\\iota_R dx)dz = R_z dx - R_x dz\n$$\nSumming these terms and collecting coefficients of $dx, dy, dz$:\n$$\n\\iota_R d\\alpha = (R_z - R_y)dx + (R_x - R_z)dy + (R_y - R_x)dz\n$$\nFor this $1$-form to be zero, its coefficients must all be zero:\n$$\nR_z - R_y = 0 \\implies R_y = R_z\n$$\n$$\nR_x - R_z = 0 \\implies R_x = R_z\n$$\n$$\nR_y - R_x = 0 \\implies R_x = R_y\n$$\nThese three equations together imply that the components of $R$ are all equal: $R_x = R_y = R_z$.\n\nNow we substitute this result into the first equation, $zR_x + xR_y + yR_z = 1$:\n$$\nzR_x + xR_x + yR_x = 1\n$$\n$$\n(x+y+z)R_x = 1\n$$\nSolving for $R_x$ gives:\n$$\nR_x = \\frac{1}{x+y+z}\n$$\nThis solution is valid precisely on the domain $U$ where $x+y+z \\neq 0$.\nThus, the components of the Reeb vector field are all equal:\n$$\nR_x = R_y = R_z = \\frac{1}{x+y+z}\n$$\nAnd the Reeb vector field itself is:\n$$\nR = \\frac{1}{x+y+z} \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem's final answer requirement is for the scalar function $f(x,y,z)$, which we have determined to be $x+y+z$.",

We are tasked with determining how the Reeb vector field and the period of a closed Reeb orbit transform under a constant positive rescaling of the contact form. We will proceed by using the fundamental definitions provided.\n\nLet $(M, \\xi)$ be a closed, connected, cooriented contact manifold with contact form $\\alpha$. The Reeb vector field $R_{\\alpha}$ is uniquely defined by the two conditions:\n$$(1) \\quad \\alpha(R_{\\alpha}) = 1$$\n$$(2) \\quad \\iota_{R_{\\alpha}}d\\alpha = 0$$\n\nA new contact form $\\alpha'$ is defined as $\\alpha' = c\\alpha$ for a real constant $c > 0$.

The equation becomes:\n$$c\\,(\\iota_{R_{\\alpha'}}d\\alpha) = 0$$\nAs $c > 0$, this is equivalent to:\n$$\\iota_{R_{\\alpha'}}d\\alpha = 0$$\nThis condition states that $R_{\\alpha'}$ must lie in the kernel of the $2$-form $d\\alpha$ at every point. On a contact manifold, the kernel of $d\\alpha$ is a one-dimensional distribution. The original Reeb vector field $R_{\\alpha}$ also satisfies $\\iota_{R_{\\alpha}}d\\alpha = 0$, meaning it spans this same kernel. Therefore, the vector field $R_{\\alpha'}$ must be pointwise proportional to $R_{\\alpha}$. We can write:\n$$R_{\\alpha'} = k R_{\\alpha}$$\nfor some scalar function $k: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNow, we use equation $(1')$ to determine $k$.\n$$\\alpha'(R_{\\alpha'}) = 1$$\nSubstituting $\\alpha' = c\\alpha$ and $R_{\\alpha'} = k R_{\\alpha}$:\n$$(c\\alpha)(k R_{\\alpha}) = 1$$\nUsing the linearity of the $1$-form $\\alpha$, we get:\n$$c k \\,\\alpha(R_{\\alpha}) = 1$$\nFrom the definition of $R_{\\alpha}$, we know that $\\alpha(R_{\\alpha}) = 1$.

Since $c$ is a constant, $k$ is also a constant.\nThus, the relationship between the two Reeb vector fields is:\n$$R_{\\alpha'} = \\frac{1}{c}R_{\\alpha}$$\n\nOur second objective is to determine the period $T'$ of the closed orbit for $R_{\\alpha'}$ which has the same geometric image as the orbit $\\gamma$ of $R_{\\alpha}$. Let $\\gamma: [0, T] \\to M$ be the parametrization of the orbit for $R_{\\alpha}$, where $T$ is the prime period. The period of a closed Reeb orbit can be calculated by integrating the contact form along the orbit.

Its period is $T'$. By the same reasoning, this period is given by the integral of the corresponding contact form $\\alpha'$ along the curve:\n$$T' = \\int_{\\gamma'} \\alpha'$$\nSince $\\gamma$ and $\\gamma'$ represent the same oriented closed curve, the line integrals are taken over the same path. Thus we can write:\n$$T' = \\int_{\\gamma} \\alpha'$$\nSubstituting the relation $\\alpha' = c\\alpha$:\n$$T' = \\int_{\\gamma} c\\alpha = c \\int_{\\gamma} \\alpha$$\nWe have already established that $\\int_{\\gamma} \\alpha = T$. Therefore, the new period $T'$ is:\n$$T' = cT$$\n\nTo summarize, under the scaling $\\alpha \\to c\\alpha$ with $c>0$, the Reeb vector field is scaled by the inverse factor, $R_\\alpha \\to \\frac{1}{c}R_\\alpha$, and the period of a closed orbit is scaled by the factor itself, $T \\to cT$. This is consistent with the velocity being scaled by $\\frac{1}{c}$; to trace the same path, the time required must be scaled by $c$.\n\nThe two derived expressions are $R_{\\alpha'} = \\frac{1}{c}R_{\\alpha}$ and $T' = cT$.",
