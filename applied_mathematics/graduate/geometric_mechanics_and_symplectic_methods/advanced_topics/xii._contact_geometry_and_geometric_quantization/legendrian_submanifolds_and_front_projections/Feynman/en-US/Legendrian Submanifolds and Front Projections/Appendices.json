            "solution": "The problem will first be validated according to the established protocol.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   The base manifold is $M = \\mathbb{T}^{2}$, the $2$-torus, with angular coordinates $(x,y)$, each taken modulo $2\\pi$. The dimension of the manifold is $n=2$.\n-   The first jet bundle is specified as $J^{1}(M)=T^{*}M\\times \\mathbb{R}$.\n-   The local coordinates for $J^{1}(M)$ are given as $(x^{1},\\dots,x^{n},p_{1},\\dots,p_{n},z)$.

The final answer is to be the resulting expression for this pullback.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is set within the established mathematical field of contact and symplectic geometry. The definitions of the first jet bundle, the tautological $1$-form, the canonical contact form, and the $1$-jet of a function are all standard and correct.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It requests a specific calculation—the pullback of a specified differential form by a map constructed from a given function and manifold. All necessary information is provided, and the task leads to a unique, well-defined mathematical object.\n-   **Objective**: The problem statement is written in precise, formal mathematical language, devoid of any subjectivity, ambiguity, or opinion.\n-   **Conclusion**: An evaluation against the flaw checklist confirms the problem is valid. It is a standard, fundamental exercise in differential geometry that tests the understanding of jet bundles and contact structures.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed as requested.\n\nThe central task is to compute the pullback of the contact $1$-form $\\alpha$ along the $1$-jet section $j^{1}f$ associated with the function $f(x,y) = \\sin(x) + \\cos(y)$ on the $2$-torus $M=\\mathbb{T}^2$. The condition for the image $L_f = j^1f(M)$ to be a Legendrian submanifold is that the dimension of $L_f$ is $n=2$ and the contact form $\\alpha$ vanishes when restricted to it. This is equivalent to showing that the pullback $j^{1}f^{*}\\alpha$ is the zero $1$-form on the domain $M$.\n\nFirst, we construct the map $j^{1}f: \\mathbb{T}^{2} \\to J^{1}(\\mathbb{T}^{2})$. The coordinates on the domain $\\mathbb{T}^{2}$ are $(x,y)$. The coordinates on the codomain $J^{1}(\\mathbb{T}^{2})$ are $(x, y, p_x, p_y, z)$. The map $j^{1}f$ is defined for a point $q \\in \\mathbb{T}^2$ by $j^{1}f(q) = (q, df_{q}, f(q))$. In local coordinates $(x,y)$, this becomes:\n$j^{1}f(x,y) = (x, y, p_{x}(x,y), p_{y}(x,y), z(x,y))$\n\nThe component functions of this map are determined as follows:\n$1$. The $z$-component function is the function $f$ itself:\n$z(x,y) = f(x,y) = \\sin(x) + \\cos(y)$.\n\n$2$. The momentum component functions, $p_x$ and $p_y$, are the components of the exterior derivative of $f$, which is the $1$-form $df$. We compute $df$:\n$df = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} dy$.\nThe partial derivatives of $f(x,y) = \\sin(x) + \\cos(y)$ are:\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\cos(x)$.\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -\\sin(y)$.\nTherefore, the differential is $df = \\cos(x) dx - \\sin(y) dy$.\nBy identifying the components of $df$ with the momenta $p_x$ and $p_y$, we obtain:\n$p_{x}(x,y) = \\cos(x)$.\n$p_{y}(x,y) = -\\sin(y)$.\n\nThe explicit form of the $1$-jet map is thus:\n$j^{1}f(x,y) = (x, y, \\cos(x), -\\sin(y), \\sin(x) + \\cos(y))$.\n\nNext, we compute the pullback $j^{1}f^{*}\\alpha$. The contact form on $J^{1}(\\mathbb{T}^{2})$ is $\\alpha = dz - p_x dx - p_y dy$.\nBy definition, the pullback of $\\alpha$ by the map $j^{1}f$ is calculated as:\n$j^{1}f^{*}\\alpha = j^{1}f^{*}(dz - p_x dx - p_y dy)$.\nUsing the properties that the pullback operator is linear and commutes with the exterior derivative ($j^{1}f^{*}d = d j^{1}f^{*}$):\n$j^{1}f^{*}\\alpha = d(j^{1}f^{*}z) - (j^{1}f^{*}p_x)(j^{1}f^{*}dx) - (j^{1}f^{*}p_y)(j^{1}f^{*}dy)$.\n\nWe evaluate each term on the manifold $\\mathbb{T}^2$ with coordinates $(x,y)$:\n-   The pullback of the function $z$ is $z \\circ j^{1}f$, which is simply the function $f(x,y)$:\n    $j^{1}f^{*}z = f(x,y) = \\sin(x) + \\cos(y)$.\n    The exterior derivative of this function is $d(f(x,y))$, which we have already computed as $df$:\n    $d(j^{1}f^{*}z) = d(\\sin(x) + \\cos(y)) = \\cos(x) dx - \\sin(y) dy$.\n\n-   The pullbacks of the functions $p_x$ and $p_y$ are their compositions with $j^{1}f$:\n    $j^{1}f^{*}p_x = p_x \\circ j^{1}f = \\cos(x)$.\n    $j^{1}f^{*}p_y = p_y \\circ j^{1}f = -\\sin(y)$.\n\n-   The pullbacks of the basis $1$-forms $dx$ and $dy$. Since the projection of $j^1f(x,y)$ back to the base manifold $\\mathbb{T}^2$ is just $(x,y)$, the pullbacks of $dx$ and $dy$ are themselves:\n    $j^{1}f^{*}dx = dx$.\n    $j^{1}f^{*}dy = dy$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the formula for $j^{1}f^{*}\\alpha$:\n$j^{1}f^{*}\\alpha = (\\cos(x) dx - \\sin(y) dy) - (\\cos(x))(dx) - (-\\sin(y))(dy)$\n$j^{1}f^{*}\\alpha = \\cos(x) dx - \\sin(y) dy - \\cos(x) dx + \\sin(y) dy$.\n\nWe group the terms corresponding to the basis $1$-forms $dx$ and $dy$:\n$j^{1}f^{*}\\alpha = (\\cos(x) - \\cos(x)) dx + (-\\sin(y) + \\sin(y)) dy$\n$j^{1}f^{*}\\alpha = 0 \\cdot dx + 0 \\cdot dy = 0$.\n\nThe result is the zero $1$-form on $\\mathbb{T}^2$. This calculation explicitly verifies the Legendrian condition for the submanifold $L_f$. This result is an instance of a general theorem in contact geometry, which states that the $1$-jet lift of any smooth function is a Legendrian submanifold. The requested analytic expression for $j^{1}f^{*}\\alpha$ is $0$.",

            "problem": "Consider the standard contact three-space $(\\mathbb{R}^{3}, \\ker(dz - y\\,dx))$ and the front projection (to the $xz$-plane) of a connected, oriented Legendrian knot $L$. The front diagram $F$ is generic: it has only transverse double points (crossings) and semicubical cusps, and it has no vertical tangencies. Away from cusps, the slope along a strand is well-defined and given by $y = \\frac{dz}{dx}$. At each crossing, two oriented strands meet with distinct slopes. You are given the following data about $F$:\n\n- The total number of cusps is $c(F) = 8$.

Finally, verify that the crossing sign assignments are consistent with the slope rule for front projections, which dictates how over/under information is recovered from slopes $s = \\frac{dz}{dx}$ at crossings in the standard contact structure.\n\nYour final answer must consist of the pair $\\big(tb(L),\\,rot(L)\\big)$ written as a row matrix. No rounding is required. No units are involved.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the Thurston-Bennequin invariant $tb(L)$ and the rotation number $rot(L)$ for a Legendrian knot $L$ in the standard contact three-space $(\\mathbb{R}^{3}, \\ker(dz - y\\,dx))$, given data from its front projection $F$. It also requires a verification of the consistency of the provided data.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical foundation. A knot $L$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, parametrized by $t$ as $\\gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))$, is Legendrian with respect to the contact form $\\alpha = dz - y\\,dx$ if its tangent vector $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = (x'(t), y'(t), z'(t))$ lies in the kernel of $\\alpha$ at every point. This translates to the condition $z'(t) - y(t)x'(t) = 0$.\n\nThe front projection $F$ of $L$ is the image of $L$ under the projection $\\pi_{xz}: (x,y,z) \\mapsto (x,z)$. The Legendrian condition implies a crucial geometric property of the front projection. Wherever $x'(t) \\neq 0$, we can reparametrize by $x$, and the condition becomes $\\frac{dz}{dx} = y$. Thus, the $y$-coordinate of the knot is equal to the slope of its front projection.\n\nAt a crossing in the front projection $F$, two points on the knot, $p_1 = (x_0, y_1, z_0)$ and $p_2 = (x_0, y_2, z_0)$, project to the same point $(x_0, z_0)$. Since $L$ is an embedded knot, $p_1 \\neq p_2$, which implies $y_1 \\neq y_2$. The front projection is viewed from $y=+\\infty$. The point with the smaller $y$-coordinate appears as the \"over-strand\" because it is closer to an observer at $y=-\\infty$ (or less obscured by the other strand from $y=+\\infty$). As $y$ corresponds to the slope $s = \\frac{dz}{dx}$, the strand with the smaller slope must pass over the strand with the larger slope. This is the slope rule for front projections:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{over}} < s_{\\mathrm{under}}$$\nThis rule is a direct consequence of the physics of projection for a Legendrian knot in this specific contact structure.\n\nThe classical invariants of a Legendrian knot $L$, the Thurston-Bennequin invariant $tb(L)$ and the rotation number $rot(L)$, can be computed directly from its front projection $F$.\n\nThe Thurston-Bennequin invariant is defined as the linking number of $L$ with a pushoff of $L$ in a direction everywhere transverse to the contact planes. For a front projection $F$, its value is given by the formula:\n$$tb(L) = w(F) - \\frac{1}{2}c(F)$$\nHere, $w(F)$ is the writhe of the front projection, defined as the sum of the signs of its crossings, $w(F) = \\sum_{p} \\sigma(p)$. The sign $\\sigma(p) \\in \\{+1, -1\\}$ of each crossing $p$ is determined using the standard right-hand rule for oriented planar diagrams. $c(F)$ is the total number of cusps in the front projection. Cusps are points where the tangent to the projection is vertical (where $x'(t) = 0$).\n\nThe rotation number $rot(L)$ measures the total winding of the tangent vector to the projection of $L$ onto the $xy$-plane, with respect to a fixed direction. For a front projection $F$ of an oriented Legendrian knot, it is computed by:\n$$rot(L) = \\frac{1}{2}(c_{\\downarrow}(F) - c_{\\uparrow}(F))$$\nHere, $c_{\\downarrow}(F)$ is the number of downward-pointing cusps, which are local maxima of the $z$-coordinate along the orientation of the knot. $c_{\\uparrow}(F)$ is the number of upward-pointing cusps, which are local minima of the $z$-coordinate along the orientation.\n\nNow, we apply these formulas using the data provided in the problem statement.\nThe given data are:\n- Number of upward cusps: $c_{\\uparrow}(F) = 5$.\n- Number of downward cusps: $c_{\\downarrow}(F) = 3$.\n- The total number of cusps is $c(F) = c_{\\uparrow}(F) + c_{\\downarrow}(F) = 5 + 3 = 8$, which matches the given $c(F) = 8$.\n- The crossing signs are given as $\\sigma_A = +1$, $\\sigma_B = -1$, $\\sigma_C = +1$, $\\sigma_D = +1$, $\\sigma_E = -1$, and $\\sigma_F = -1$.\n\nFirst, we compute the rotation number $rot(L)$:\n$$rot(L) = \\frac{1}{2}(c_{\\downarrow}(F) - c_{\\uparrow}(F)) = \\frac{1}{2}(3 - 5) = \\frac{1}{2}(-2) = -1$$\n\nNext, we compute the Thurston-Bennequin invariant $tb(L)$. We begin by calculating the writhe $w(F)$:\n$$w(F) = \\sum \\sigma = (+1) + (-1) + (+1) + (+1) + (-1) + (-1) = 0$$\nUsing this writhe and the total number of cusps, we find $tb(L)$:\n$$tb(L) = w(F) - \\frac{1}{2}c(F) = 0 - \\frac{1}{2}(8) = -4$$\n\nFinally, we must verify the consistency of the data provided for the crossings with the slope rule for front projections. The rule is that at every crossing, the slope of the over-passing strand must be less than the slope of the under-passing strand ($s_{\\mathrm{over}} < s_{\\mathrm{under}}$). We check this for each of the $6$ crossings:\n1.  Crossing $A$: $(s_{\\mathrm{over}}, s_{\\mathrm{under}}) = (-\\frac{1}{2}, 1)$. The condition is $-\\frac{1}{2} < 1$, which is true.\n2.  Crossing $B$: $(s_{\\mathrm{over}}, s_{\\mathrm{under}}) = (-2, -\\frac{1}{4})$. The condition is $-2 < -0.25$, which is true.\n3.  Crossing $C$: $(s_{\\mathrm{over}}, s_{\\mathrm{under}}) = (0, 3)$. The condition is $0 < 3$, which is true.\n4.  Crossing $D$: $(s_{\\mathrm{over}}, s_{\\mathrm{under}}) = (-1, 2)$. The condition is $-1 < 2$, which is true.\n5.  Crossing $E$: $(s_{\\mathrm{over}}, s_{\\mathrm{under}}) = (-3, -1)$. The condition is $-3 < -1$, which is true.\n6.  Crossing $F$: $(s_{\\mathrm{over}}, s_{\\mathrm{under}}) = (-\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$. The condition is $-1.5 < 0.5$, which is true.\n\nAll given crossing data are consistent with the geometric constraint imposed on front projections by the Legendrian condition. The over/under designation for each crossing correctly reflects the relative values of the slopes. The crossing signs $\\sigma$ are additional data related to the knot's specific embedding and orientation, which we have used to compute the writhe. The problem statement is therefore internally consistent and well-posed.\n\nThe computed invariants are $tb(L) = -4$ and $rot(L) = -1$.",
