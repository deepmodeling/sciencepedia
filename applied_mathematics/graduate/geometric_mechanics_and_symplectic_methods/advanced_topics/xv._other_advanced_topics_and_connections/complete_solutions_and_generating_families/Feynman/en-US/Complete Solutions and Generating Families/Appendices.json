All necessary information is provided, the conditions are consistent, and the terminology is precise.\n\nThe objective is to find the Type $2$ generating function, $F_{2}(q,P)$, corresponding to the given Type $1$ generating function, $F_{1}(q,Q)$, via a Legendre transformation with respect to the variable $Q$.\n\nA Type $1$ generating function $F_1(q,Q)$ depends on the old configuration variable $q$ and the new configuration variable $Q$. It defines a canonical transformation through the relations:\n$$\np = \\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial q}\n$$\n$$\nP = -\\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial Q}\n$$\nwhere $p$ is the old momentum and $P$ is the new momentum.\n\nA Type $2$ generating function $F_2(q,P)$ depends on the old configuration variable $q$ and the new momentum variable $P$.

Specifically, $F_2(q,P)$ is obtained from $F_1(q,Q)$ by the following formula:\n$$\nF_{2}(q,P) = F_{1}(q,Q) + P Q\n$$\nIn this expression, the variable $Q$ must be expressed as a function of the variables of $F_2$, which are $q$ and $P$. This functional dependence, $Q(q,P)$, is found by inverting the relation for the new momentum, $P = -\\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial Q}$.\n\nThe given Type $1$ generating function is:\n$$\nF_{1}(q,Q) = \\frac{1}{2}aq^{2} + bqQ + \\frac{1}{2}cQ^{2}\n$$\nThe parameters $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants, with the given condition $c \\neq 0$.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the new momentum $P$ and the variables of $F_1$:\n$$\nP = -\\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial Q} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Q} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}aq^{2} + bqQ + \\frac{1}{2}cQ^{2}\\right)\n$$\nPerforming the partial differentiation with respect to $Q$ yields:\n$$\nP = -(bq + cQ) = -bq - cQ\n$$\nThe problem requires us to express $Q$ in terms of $q$ and $P$.
