It defines a canonical transformation through the relations:\n$$\np = \\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial q}\n$$\n$$\nP = -\\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial Q}\n$$\nwhere $p$ is the old momentum and $P$ is the new momentum.\n\nA Type $2$ generating function $F_2(q,P)$ depends on the old configuration variable $q$ and the new momentum variable $P$.

Specifically, $F_2(q,P)$ is obtained from $F_1(q,Q)$ by the following formula:\n$$\nF_{2}(q,P) = F_{1}(q,Q) + P Q\n$$\nIn this expression, the variable $Q$ must be expressed as a function of the variables of $F_2$, which are $q$ and $P$.
