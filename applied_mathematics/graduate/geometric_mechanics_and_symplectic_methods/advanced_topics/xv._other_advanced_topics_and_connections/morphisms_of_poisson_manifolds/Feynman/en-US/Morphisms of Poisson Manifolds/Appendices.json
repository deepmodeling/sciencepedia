We first compute these pulled-back functions.\nThe pullback of a function $f$ under a map $F$ is defined as $F^*f = f \\circ F$.\nApplying this to our specific functions $f$ and $g$:\n$$F^*f(x,y) = f(F(x,y)) = f(x, a\\,y) = \\frac{1}{2}x^2$$\n$$F^*g(x,y) = g(F(x,y)) = g(x, a\\,y) = a\\,y$$\nNext, we compute the Poisson bracket $\\{F^*f, F^*g\\}_{\\pi_M}$.

            "solution": "The problem presents two distinct tasks. The first is to provide a justification for specific claims within the theory of Dirac manifolds. The second is to perform a calculation related to Poisson manifolds.\n\nPart 1: Justification of Dirac Structures and Morphism\n\nA Dirac structure on a manifold $P$ is a subbundle $L$ of the Pontryagin bundle $TP \\oplus T^*P$ that is maximally isotropic with respect to the canonical symmetric pairing $\\langle (X,\\alpha), (Y,\\beta) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}(\\alpha(Y) + \\beta(X))$, and is closed under the Courant bracket.\n\nFor a given $2$-form $\\omega \\in \\Omega^2(P)$, its graph is the subbundle $L_{\\omega} = \\{ (X, i_X \\omega) \\mid X \\in TP \\}$, where $i_X \\omega$ denotes the contraction of $\\omega$ by the vector field $X$.\nThe rank of $L_{\\omega}$ is $\\dim(P)$, which is half the rank of $TP \\oplus T^*P$. To be maximally isotropic, $L_{\\omega}$ must be isotropic. We take two sections $(X, i_X \\omega)$ and $(Y, i_Y \\omega)$ of $L_{\\omega}$ and compute their pairing:\n$$ \\langle (X, i_X \\omega), (Y, i_Y \\omega) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}( (i_X \\omega)(Y) + (i_Y \\omega)(X) ) = \\frac{1}{2}( \\omega(X,Y) + \\omega(Y,X) ) $$\nSince $\\omega$ is a $2$-form, it is skew-symmetric, i.e., $\\omega(X,Y) = -\\omega(Y,X)$. Thus, the pairing is:\n$$ \\langle (X, i_X \\omega), (Y, i_Y \\omega) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}( \\omega(X,Y) - \\omega(X,Y) ) = 0 $$\nThis confirms that $L_{\\omega}$ is an isotropic subbundle, and by its rank, it is maximally isotropic.\n\nA fundamental theorem states that such a structure $L_{\\omega}$ is integrable (closed under the Courant bracket) if and only if the $2$-form $\\omega$ is closed, i.e., $d\\omega = 0$.\nThe manifold $M=\\mathbb{R}^3$ is equipped with $\\omega_M = dx \\wedge dy$. Its exterior derivative is:\n$$ d\\omega_M = d(dx \\wedge dy) = d(dx) \\wedge dy - dx \\wedge d(dy) = 0 \\wedge dy - dx \\wedge 0 = 0 $$\nSince $d\\omega_M = 0$, $\\omega_M$ is closed, and thus $L_{\\omega_M}$ defines an integrable Dirac structure on $M$.\n\nThe manifold $N=\\mathbb{R}^2$ is equipped with $\\omega_N = du \\wedge dv$. Its exterior derivative is:\n$$ d\\omega_N = d(du \\wedge dv) = d(du) \\wedge dv - du \\wedge d(dv) = 0 \\wedge dv - du \\wedge 0 = 0 $$\nSince $d\\omega_N = 0$, $\\omega_N$ is closed, and thus $L_{\\omega_N}$ defines an integrable Dirac structure on $N$.\n\nNext, we address whether the map $f: M \\to N$ given by $f(x,y,z)=(x,y)$ is a Dirac morphism. For Dirac structures arising as graphs of closed $2$-forms $\\omega_M$ and $\\omega_N$, the map $f$ is a Dirac morphism if and only if the pullback of $\\omega_N$ by $f$ equals $\\omega_M$, i.e., $f^*\\omega_N = \\omega_M$.\nThe coordinate representation of the map $f$ is $u=x$ and $v=y$. We compute the pullback:\n$$ f^*\\omega_N = f^*(du \\wedge dv) = (f^*du) \\wedge (f^*dv) $$\nUsing the property $f^*(d\\phi) = d(\\phi \\circ f)$, we have:\n$$ f^*du = d(u \\circ f) = d(x) = dx $$\n$$ f^*dv = d(v \\circ f) = d(y) = dy $$\nSubstituting these expressions, we obtain:\n$$ f^*\\omega_N = dx \\wedge dy = \\omega_M $$\nThe condition is satisfied, which justifies that $f$ is a Dirac morphism from $(M, L_{\\omega_M})$ to $(N, L_{\\omega_N})$.\n\nPart 2: Computation of the Poisson Map Failure\n\nIn this part, the manifolds are equipped with different structures: $M$ has the zero Poisson bivector $\\pi_M = 0$, and $N$ has the canonical Poisson bivector $\\pi_N = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}$. The Poisson bracket is defined by $\\{F,G\\}_{\\pi} = \\pi(dF,dG)$.

Let $F = \\varphi \\circ f$ and $G = \\psi \\circ f$.\n$$ F(x,y,z) = (\\varphi \\circ f)(x,y,z) = \\varphi(x,y) = x $$\n$$ G(x,y,z) = (\\psi \\circ f)(x,y,z) = \\psi(x,y) = y $$\nThe Poisson bracket on $M$ is determined by $\\pi_M = 0$.\n$$ \\{\\varphi\\circ f, \\psi\\circ f\\}_{\\pi_M} = \\pi_M(dF, dG) = 0(dx, dy) = 0 $$\nThe first term of $\\Delta$ is $0$.\n\nSecond, we analyze the term $\\big(\\{\\varphi,\\psi\\}_{\\pi_{N}}\\circ f\\big)$. We begin by computing the Poisson bracket $\\{\\varphi, \\psi\\}_{\\pi_N}$ on $N$. The differentials of $\\varphi$ and $\\psi$ are $d\\varphi = du$ and $d\\psi = dv$.\n$$ \\{\\varphi, \\psi\\}_{\\pi_N} = \\pi_N(d\\varphi, d\\psi) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}\\right)(du, dv) $$\nThe action of a bivector on a pair of $1$-forms is given by the determinant-like formula:\n$$ \\{\\varphi, \\psi\\}_{\\pi_N} = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}, du \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}, dv \\right\\rangle - \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}, dv \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}, du \\right\\rangle $$\nIn canonical coordinates, the pairing between basis vectors and basis covectors is $\\langle \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^i}, dq^j \\rangle = \\delta_i^j$. Thus:\n$$ \\{\\varphi, \\psi\\}_{\\pi_N} = (1)(1) - (0)(0) = 1 $$\nThe result is the constant function on $N$ with value $1$. We then compose this function with $f: M \\to N$. The composition of a constant function is the constant itself.\n$$ \\big(\\{\\varphi, \\psi\\}_{\\pi_{N}}\\circ f\\big)(x,y,z) = 1 $$\nThe second term of $\\Delta$ is $1$.\n\nFinally, we compute $\\Delta$:\n$$ \\Delta = \\{\\varphi\\circ f,\\psi\\circ f\\}_{\\pi_{M}} - \\big(\\{\\varphi,\\psi\\}_{\\pi_{N}}\\circ f\\big) = 0 - 1 = -1 $$\nThe quantified failure of the Poisson map condition is $-1$.",

It presents a standard problem in the field of geometric mechanics concerning Poisson reduction. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into four tasks. We will address them sequentially.\n\n**1. Hamiltonian Action and Momentum Map**\n\nThe configuration space is $Q = \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with coordinates $(q^1, q^2) = (x,y)$. The phase space is its cotangent bundle $T^{*}Q$, which has canonical coordinates $(x,y,p_x,p_y)$. The canonical one-form on $T^{*}Q$ is $\\theta = p_i dq^i = p_x dx + p_y dy$. The canonical symplectic form is $\\omega = -d\\theta = dx \\wedge dp_x + dy \\wedge dp_y$.\n\nThe Lie group is $G = \\mathbb{R}$ (under addition), and its Lie algebra is $\\mathfrak{g} \\cong \\mathbb{R}$. We choose the basis vector $\\xi = 1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ for $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\nThe action of $G$ on $Q$ is given by $a \\cdot (x,y) = (x+a, y)$ for $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The infinitesimal generator of this action on $Q$ corresponding to $\\xi = 1$ is the vector field $\\xi_Q$ given by:\n$$\n\\xi_Q(q) = \\left. \\frac{d}{da} \\right|_{a=0} (a \\cdot q) = \\left. \\frac{d}{da} \\right|_{a=0} (x+a, y) = (1, 0)\n$$\nIn the coordinate basis, $\\xi_Q = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$.\n\nFor a cotangent-lifted action, the associated momentum map $J: T^*Q \\to \\mathfrak{g}^*$ is defined by the pairing $J(\\alpha_q)(\\xi) = \\alpha_q(\\xi_Q(q))$, where $\\alpha_q \\in T_q^*Q$ is a point in the phase space. Identifying $\\mathfrak{g}^*$ with $\\mathbb{R}$, we get a function $J: T^*Q \\to \\mathbb{R}$. A point $\\alpha_q$ in $T^*Q$ with coordinates $(x,y,p_x,p_y)$ corresponds to the one-form $p_x dx + p_y dy$ at the point $(x,y)$.\nThus, the momentum map is:\n$$\nJ(x,y,p_x,p_y) = (p_x dx + p_y dy) \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\right) = p_x\n$$\nSo, the momentum map is the function $J(x,y,p_x,p_y) = p_x$.\n\nTo verify the action is Hamiltonian, we must show that the infinitesimal generator of the action on $T^*Q$ is the Hamiltonian vector field of the momentum map. Let's use the convention $i_{X_H} \\omega = dH$ for a Hamiltonian function $H$. The Hamiltonian function corresponding to $\\xi=1$ is $J_\\xi = J = p_x$. The Hamiltonian vector field $X_{p_x}$ is determined by the equation $i_{X_{p_x}} \\omega = d(p_x) = dp_x$. Let $X_{p_x} = A\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + B\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + C\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_x} + D\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_y}$.\n$$\ni_{X_{p_x}}\\omega = i_{X_{p_x}}(dx \\wedge dp_x + dy \\wedge dp_y) = A dp_x - C dx + B dp_y - D dy\n$$\nComparing this with $dp_x$, we find $A=1$, $C=0$, $B=0$, $D=0$. Thus, the Hamiltonian vector field is $X_{p_x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$.\n\nNow, we find the infinitesimal generator of the cotangent-lifted action on $T^*Q$. The action on $Q$ is $\\Phi_a(x,y) = (x+a,y)$. The cotangent-lifted action sends a point $(x,y,p_x,p_y)$ to $(x',y',p'_x,p'_y)$ where $(x',y') = \\Phi_a(x,y)$ and the momenta transform via the transpose of the inverse of the tangent map, $p_i' = p_j (T\\Phi_{-a})^j_i$. It is simpler to compute the action by considering how the coordinates transform: $x' = x+a$, $y' = y$. The momenta transform such that $p_x'dx' + p_y'dy' = p_x dx + p_y dy$. Since $dx' = dx$ and $dy' = dy$, we must have $p_x'=p_x$ and $p_y'=p_y$. So the action on $T^*Q$ is:\n$$\na \\cdot (x,y,p_x,p_y) = (x+a, y, p_x, p_y)\n$$\nThe infinitesimal generator of this action is:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{d}{da} \\right|_{a=0} (x+a, y, p_x, p_y) = (1,0,0,0)\n$$\nThis corresponds to the vector field $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$ on $T^*Q$. Since this matches the Hamiltonian vector field $X_{p_x}$, the action is Hamiltonian with momentum map $J=p_x$.\n\n**2. Quotient Manifold and Coordinates**\n\nThe action of $\\mathbb{R}$ on $T^*Q$ is $a \\cdot (x,y,p_x,p_y) = (x+a, y, p_x, p_y)$. Two points are in the same orbit if and only if they have the same values for $y$, $p_x$, and $p_y$. The $x$ coordinate is the only one that changes along an orbit. The quotient manifold $T^*Q/\\mathbb{R}$ is the space of these orbits. Each orbit is uniquely specified by the values of $(y, p_y, p_x)$. Therefore, the quotient manifold is diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\nA global coordinate system on this quotient manifold can be constructed from functions on $T^*Q$ that are invariant under the action. A function $f(x,y,p_x,p_y)$ is $\\mathbb{R}$-invariant if $f(x+a, y, p_x, p_y) = f(x,y,p_x,p_y)$ for all $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This condition implies that $f$ must be independent of $x$. The simplest such independent functions are:\n$$\nY(x,y,p_x,p_y) = y \\quad , \\quad P_y(x,y,p_x,p_y) = p_y \\quad , \\quad P_x(x,y,p_x,p_y) = p_x\n$$\nThese three functions $(Y, P_y, P_x)$ form a global coordinate system for the quotient manifold $T^*Q/\\mathbb{R} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n**3. Reduced Poisson Bracket and Casimirs**\n\nThe canonical Poisson bracket on $T^*Q$ for two functions $f,g \\in C^{\\infty}(T^*Q)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\{f,g\\} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p_x} - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_x}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p_y} - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_y}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y}\n$$\nThe projection map $\\pi: T^*Q \\to T^*Q/\\mathbb{R}$ is given in coordinates by $\\pi(x,y,p_x,p_y) = (y, p_y, p_x)$. For any two functions $F, G \\in C^{\\infty}(T^*Q/\\mathbb{R})$, their lifts to $T^*Q$ are $\\tilde{F} = F \\circ \\pi$ and $\\tilde{G} = G \\circ \\pi$. In our chosen coordinates, this means $\\tilde{F}(x,y,p_x,p_y) = F(y,p_y,p_x)$ and similarly for $\\tilde{G}$. The functions $\\tilde{F}$ and $\\tilde{G}$ are manifestly $\\mathbb{R}$-invariant (they do not depend on $x$).\n\nThe reduced Poisson bracket $\\{F,G\\}_{\\mathrm{red}}$ on the quotient manifold is defined by the requirement that $\\pi$ be a Poisson morphism, i.e., $\\{\\tilde{F}, \\tilde{G}\\} = \\{F,G\\}_{\\mathrm{red}} \\circ \\pi$. We compute the bracket of the lifted functions:\n$$\n\\{\\tilde{F},\\tilde{G}\\} = \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{F}}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{G}}{\\partial p_x} - \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{F}}{\\partial p_x}\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{G}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{F}}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{G}}{\\partial p_y} - \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{F}}{\\partial p_y}\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{G}}{\\partial y}\n$$\nSince $\\tilde{F}$ and $\\tilde{G}$ are independent of $x$, we have $\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{F}}{\\partial x} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{G}}{\\partial x} = 0$. The bracket simplifies to:\n$$\n\\{\\tilde{F},\\tilde{G}\\} = \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{F}}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{G}}{\\partial p_y} - \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{F}}{\\partial p_y}\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{G}}{\\partial y}\n$$\nUsing the chain rule, e.g., $\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{F}}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y}$, where we use $(Y,P_y,P_x)$ for the coordinates on the quotient manifold to avoid confusion, we get:\n$$\n\\{F,G\\}_{\\mathrm{red}}(Y,P_y,P_x) = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial P_y} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial P_y}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial Y}\n$$\nReturning to the more conventional notation where the coordinate functions on the quotient are just called $y, p_y, p_x$, the reduced Poisson bracket is:\n$$\n\\{F,G\\}_{\\mathrm{red}}(y,p_y,p_x) = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial p_y} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p_y}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y}\n$$\nThis bracket structure is canonical on the $(y,p_y)$ plane, for each fixed value of $p_x$.\n\nA Casimir function $C$ for this reduced bracket is a function that Poisson-commutes with all other functions: $\\{C,H\\}_{\\mathrm{red}} = 0$ for all $H \\in C^{\\infty}(T^*Q/\\mathbb{R})$.\n$$\n\\{C,H\\}_{\\mathrm{red}} = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_y} - \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial p_y}\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y} = 0\n$$\nFor this to hold for arbitrary $H$, its coefficients must vanish, which means we must have $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial p_y} = 0$. This implies that $C$ can only be a function of $p_x$. Any function of the form $C(p_x)$ is a Casimir function for the reduced Poisson bracket. The coordinate $p_x$ itself is a fundamental Casimir. This reflects the fact that $p_x$ is the conserved quantity (momentum map) associated with the symmetry.\n\n**4. Computation of a specific reduced bracket**\n\nWe are given the two $\\mathbb{R}$-invariant functions:\n$$\nF(y,p_{y},p_{x}) = y^{3} + p_{y} p_{x}\n$$\n$$\nG(y,p_{y},p_{x}) = y^{2} p_{y} + \\sin(p_{x})\n$$\nWe use the formula for the reduced bracket derived above:\n$$\n\\{F,G\\}_{\\mathrm{red}} = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial p_y} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p_y}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y}\n$$\nFirst, we compute the necessary partial derivatives. Note that derivatives with respect to $p_x$ do not appear in the formula.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(y^{3} + p_{y} p_{x}) = 3y^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p_y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_y}(y^{3} + p_{y} p_{x}) = p_{x}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(y^{2} p_{y} + \\sin(p_{x})) = 2y p_{y}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial p_y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_y}(y^{2} p_{y} + \\sin(p_{x})) = y^{2}\n$$\nNow, substitute these expressions into the reduced bracket formula:\n$$\n\\{F,G\\}_{\\mathrm{red}} = (3y^{2})(y^{2}) - (p_x)(2y p_y)\n$$\nSimplifying the expression, we obtain the final result:\n$$\n\\{F,G\\}_{\\mathrm{red}} = 3y^{4} - 2y p_y p_x\n$$\nThis is a function on the reduced space $T^*Q/\\mathbb{R}$, as it depends only on the coordinates $y$, $p_y$, and $p_x$.",
