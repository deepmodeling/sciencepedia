An absolute integral invariant is a quantity that remains constant in time as the domain of integration is transported by the flow.\n\nLet $\\varphi_{t}$ be the Hamiltonian flow generated by the Hamiltonian $H$. The surface $S_{t}$ is the image of the initial surface $S_{0}$ under this flow, i.e., $S_{t} = \\varphi_{t}(S_{0})$. The integral is $I(t) = \\int_{\\varphi_{t}(S_{0})} \\omega$. Using the change of variables formula for integration of differential forms, we can pull back the integral to the fixed domain $S_{0}$:\n$$\nI(t) = \\int_{S_{0}} (\\varphi_{t})^{*}\\omega\n$$\nwhere $(\\varphi_{t})^{*}$ is the pullback map induced by the flow $\\varphi_{t}$.\n\nTo demonstrate that $I(t)$ is an invariant, we must show that it is independent of time $t$. This is equivalent to showing that its time derivative is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}I(t) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\int_{S_{0}} (\\varphi_{t})^{*}\\omega = \\int_{S_{0}} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}(\\varphi_{t})^{*}\\omega\n$$\nThe time evolution of the pullback of a form under a flow generated by a vector field $X$ is given by the Lie derivative: $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}(\\varphi_{t})^{*}\\omega = (\\varphi_{t})^{*}(\\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\omega)$, where $X_H$ is the Hamiltonian vector field associated with $H$. Thus, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}I(t) = \\int_{S_{0}} (\\varphi_{t})^{*}(\\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\omega)\n$$\nThe integral $I(t)$ is constant if and only if the Lie derivative of the symplectic form $\\omega$ with respect to the Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ is zero, i.e., $\\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\omega = 0$. We now prove this from first principles.\n\nBy Cartan's \"magic\" formula, the Lie derivative of a differential form $\\alpha$ with respect to a vector field $X$ is given by $\\mathcal{L}_{X}\\alpha = \\mathrm{d}(i_{X}\\alpha) + i_{X}(\\mathrm{d}\\alpha)$, where $\\mathrm{d}$ is the exterior derivative and $i_{X}$ is the interior product. For our case, this becomes:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\omega = \\mathrm{d}(i_{X_H}\\omega) + i_{X_H}(\\mathrm{d}\\omega)\n$$\nA fundamental property of a symplectic form is that it is closed, meaning its exterior derivative is zero. Let's verify this for the given form $\\omega = \\mathrm{d}q_{1} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p_{1} + \\mathrm{d}q_{2} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p_{2}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\omega = \\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}q_{1} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p_{1}) + \\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}q_{2} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p_{2})\n$$\nUsing the property $\\mathrm{d}(\\alpha \\wedge \\beta) = \\mathrm{d}\\alpha \\wedge \\beta - \\alpha \\wedge \\mathrm{d}\\beta$ and the fact that the exterior derivative of an exact form $\\mathrm{d}f$ is zero (i.e., $\\mathrm{d}^{2}=0$), we get:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}q_{1} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p_{1}) = (\\mathrm{d}^{2}q_{1}) \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p_{1} - \\mathrm{d}q_{1} \\wedge (\\mathrm{d}^{2}p_{1}) = 0 - 0 = 0\n$$\nSimilarly, $\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}q_{2} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p_{2})=0$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{d}\\omega = 0$. The symplectic form is closed. This implies that the second term in Cartan's formula vanishes: $i_{X_H}(\\mathrm{d}\\omega) = i_{X_H}(0) = 0$.\n\nWe are left with $\\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\omega = \\mathrm{d}(i_{X_H}\\omega)$. The Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ is, by definition, the unique vector field that satisfies the relation $i_{X_H}\\omega = -\\mathrm{d}H$.

This confirms that $I(t)$ is a constant, independent of $t$. Therefore, $I(t)$ is an absolute integral invariant of the flow. This invariance is a general property of all Hamiltonian flows and is a statement of Poincaré's theorem on integral invariants (specifically, that $\\omega$ is an absolute integral invariant).\n\nTo find the value of $I(t)$, we can simply compute it at any time, for instance at $t=0$:\n$$\nI(t) = I(0) = \\int_{S_{0}}\\omega\n$$\nThe surface $S_{0}$ is an oriented parallelogram in $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ spanned by the vectors $v_{1} = (1,\\,0,\\,2,\\,-1)$ and $v_{2} = (0,\\,2,\\,1,\\,3)$.

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and self-contained. All definitions and conditions are standard in the field of geometric mechanics and symplectic geometry. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem consists of three parts. I will address them sequentially.\n\n**Part 1: Analysis of the one-form $\\alpha$ and its restriction**\n\nThe one-form on the manifold $M=\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is given by $\\alpha = p\\,dq$. To determine if $\\alpha$ is exact, we first check if it is a closed form. A form is closed if its exterior derivative is zero. We compute the exterior derivative of $\\alpha$:\n$$\nd\\alpha = d(p\\,dq) = dp \\wedge dq + p \\wedge d(dq)\n$$\nSince $d(dq) = d(d(q)) = 0$ for any coordinate function $q$, the second term vanishes. This leaves:\n$$\nd\\alpha = dp \\wedge dq\n$$\nThe problem statement defines the canonical symplectic form as $\\omega = dp \\wedge dq$. Therefore, $d\\alpha = \\omega$. Since $\\omega$ is a non-zero $2$-form on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, $d\\alpha \\neq 0$. Because $\\alpha$ is not closed, it cannot be exact. A necessary condition for a $k$-form to be exact ($ \\alpha = d\\beta $) is that it must be closed ($ d\\alpha = d(d\\beta) = 0 $).\n\nNext, we consider the restriction of $\\alpha$ to the submanifold $N = \\{(q,p) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid p=0\\}$. Let $i: N \\hookrightarrow M$ be the inclusion map. A point in $N$ is uniquely specified by its $q$ coordinate, so we can parameterize $N$ by $q$. The inclusion map is $i(q) = (q, 0)$. The restricted form is the pullback $i^{*}\\alpha$:\n$$\ni^{*}\\alpha = i^{*}(p\\,dq) = (i^{*}p) d(i^{*}q)\n$$\nThe pullback of the function $p$ to $N$, denoted $i^{*}p$, is the function $p$ evaluated on the points of $N$. On $N$, the coordinate $p$ is identically zero. Thus, $i^{*}p = 0$. The pullback of the function $q$ is simply $q$ itself, so $i^*q = q$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $i^{*}\\alpha$:\n$$\ni^{*}\\alpha = (0) d(q) = 0\n$$\nThe result is the zero $1$-form on $N$. We must show that this form is exact on $N$. This requires finding a smooth function (a $0$-form) $\\beta$ on $N$ such that $d\\beta = i^{*}\\alpha = 0$. Let us consider a constant function $\\beta: N \\to \\mathbb{R}$, defined by $\\beta(q) = c$ for some constant $c$. Its exterior derivative is:\n$$\nd\\beta = \\frac{\\partial\\beta}{\\partial q} dq = \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial q} dq = 0\n$$\nSince we have found such a function (e.g., $\\beta=0$), the form $i^{*}\\alpha$ is exact on $N$.\n\n**Part 2: Proof of the invariance of $I(t)$**\n\nThe quantity to be analyzed is $I(t) = \\int_{\\gamma_t} \\alpha$. The curve $\\gamma_t$ is obtained by evolving the initial curve $\\gamma_0$ under the Hamiltonian flow $\\phi_t$ of the vector field $X_H$. Thus, $\\gamma_t = \\phi_t(\\gamma_0)$. The integral can be rewritten using the pullback of the flow map:\n$$\nI(t) = \\int_{\\phi_t(\\gamma_0)} \\alpha = \\int_{\\gamma_0} \\phi_t^{*}\\alpha\n$$\nTo show that $I(t)$ is independent of $t$, we must show its time derivative is zero. Differentiating with respect to $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{\\gamma_0} \\phi_t^{*}\\alpha = \\int_{\\gamma_0} \\frac{d}{dt}(\\phi_t^{*}\\alpha)\n$$\nThe time derivative of a pullback along a flow is the pullback of the Lie derivative: $\\frac{d}{dt}(\\phi_t^{*}\\alpha) = \\phi_t^{*}(\\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\alpha)$. Substituting this back and changing the domain of integration from $\\gamma_0$ to $\\gamma_t$:\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{dt} = \\int_{\\gamma_0} \\phi_t^{*}(\\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\alpha) = \\int_{\\phi_t(\\gamma_0)} \\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\alpha = \\int_{\\gamma_t} \\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\alpha\n$$\nWe now use Cartan's magic formula for the Lie derivative: $\\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\alpha = i_{X_H}(d\\alpha) + d(i_{X_H}\\alpha)$. Let's compute each term.\nFrom Part 1, we know $d\\alpha = \\omega$. So, the first term is $i_{X_H}(d\\alpha) = i_{X_H}\\omega$. By the definition of the Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ given in the problem, $i_{X_H}\\omega = dH$.\n\nFor the second term, $d(i_{X_H}\\alpha)$, we first need to find the vector field $X_H$. The Hamiltonian is $H(q,p) = \\frac{1}{2}p^{2}$, so its exterior derivative is $dH = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q}dq + \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p}dp = 0 \\cdot dq + p \\cdot dp = p\\,dp$.

We compute the interior product $i_{X_H}\\omega$:\n$$\ni_{X_H}\\omega = i_{\\dot{q}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q} + \\dot{p}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}}(dp \\wedge dq) = \\dot{q} i_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}}(dp \\wedge dq) + \\dot{p} i_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}}(dp \\wedge dq) = \\dot{q}(-dp) + \\dot{p}(dq) = \\dot{p}\\,dq - \\dot{q}\\,dp\n$$\nEquating $i_{X_H}\\omega$ with $dH$:\n$$\n\\dot{p}\\,dq - \\dot{q}\\,dp = 0\\,dq + p\\,dp\n$$\nBy comparing the coefficients of the basis 1-forms $dq$ and $dp$, we find Hamilton's equations for this system: $\\dot{p}=0$ and $-\\dot{q}=p$, which implies $\\dot{q}=-p$. The Hamiltonian vector field is therefore $X_H = -p\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}$.\n\nNow we compute the function $i_{X_H}\\alpha = \\alpha(X_H)$:\n$$\ni_{X_H}\\alpha = (p\\,dq) \\left(-p\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}\\right) = p \\cdot dq\\left(-p\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}\\right) = p \\cdot(-p) \\cdot dq\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}\\right) = p \\cdot (-p) \\cdot 1 = -p^2\n$$\nNow we can assemble the Lie derivative:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\alpha = dH + d(-p^2) = d\\left(\\frac{1}{2}p^2\\right) + d(-p^2) = d\\left(\\frac{1}{2}p^2 - p^2\\right) = d\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}p^2\\right)\n$$\nThe Lie derivative is an exact form. Substituting this back into the expression for $\\frac{dI}{dt}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{dt} = \\int_{\\gamma_t} d\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}p^2\\right)\n$$\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for line integrals, the integral of an exact form $dF$ over a curve $\\gamma$ is the difference of $F$ evaluated at the endpoints of the curve. Let the endpoints of $\\gamma_t$ be $z_{start}(t)$ and $z_{end}(t)$.\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{dt} = \\left[-\\frac{1}{2}p^2\\right]_{z_{start}(t)}^{z_{end}(t)} = -\\frac{1}{2} [p(z_{end}(t))]^2 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} [p(z_{start}(t))]^2\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that the endpoints of $\\gamma_t$ remain in the submanifold $N$ for all $t$. The submanifold $N$ is defined by $p=0$. Therefore, at the endpoints, $p(z_{start}(t))=0$ and $p(z_{end}(t))=0$. This gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{2}(0)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(0)^2 = 0\n$$\nSince $\\frac{dI}{dt}=0$ for all $t$, the quantity $I(t)$ is independent of $t$; it is an invariant.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of the invariant $I(0)$**\n\nSince $I(t)$ is a constant, its value is equal to its value at $t=0$, which is $I(0) = \\int_{\\gamma_0} \\alpha$. We are given a piecewise smooth path $\\gamma_0$, which is the union of three segments: $\\gamma_0 = \\gamma_0^{(1)} \\cup \\gamma_0^{(2)} \\cup \\gamma_0^{(3)}$. The integral is the sum of the integrals over each segment:\n$$\nI(0) = \\int_{\\gamma_0^{(1)}} p\\,dq + \\int_{\\gamma_0^{(2)}} p\\,dq + \\int_{\\gamma_0^{(3)}} p\\,dq\n$$\nWe compute each integral using the given parameterizations. The integral of $p\\,dq$ over a parameterized curve $(q(\\lambda), p(\\lambda))$ is $\\int p(\\lambda) \\frac{dq}{d\\lambda} d\\lambda$.\n\nSegment $\\gamma_0^{(1)}$: $q(\\lambda)=0$, $p(\\lambda)=\\lambda A$ for $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$.\nHere, $q(\\lambda)=0$, so $\\frac{dq}{d\\lambda}=0$. The integrand is zero.\n$$\n\\int_{\\gamma_0^{(1)}} p\\,dq = \\int_0^1 (\\lambda A) (0) d\\lambda = 0\n$$\n\nSegment $\\gamma_0^{(2)}$: $q(\\lambda)=\\lambda Q$, $p(\\lambda)=A$ for $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$.\nHere, $q(\\lambda)=\\lambda Q$, so $\\frac{dq}{d\\lambda}=Q$. The value of $p$ is constant, $p(\\lambda)=A$.\n$$\n\\int_{\\gamma_0^{(2)}} p\\,dq = \\int_0^1 (A) (Q) d\\lambda = AQ \\int_0^1 d\\lambda = AQ [\\lambda]_0^1 = AQ\n$$\n\nSegment $\\gamma_0^{(3)}$: $q(\\lambda)=Q$, $p(\\lambda)=A(1-\\lambda)$ for $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$.\nHere, $q(\\lambda)=Q$, so $\\frac{dq}{d\\lambda}=0$. The integrand is zero.\n$$\n\\int_{\\gamma_0^{(3)}} p\\,dq = \\int_0^1 A(1-\\lambda) (0) d\\lambda = 0\n$$\n\nSumming the results for the three segments:\n$$\nI(0) = 0 + AQ + 0 = AQ\n$$\nThe value of the invariant is $AQ$.",
