An absolute integral invariant is a quantity that remains constant in time as the domain of integration is transported by the flow.\n\nLet $\\varphi_{t}$ be the Hamiltonian flow generated by the Hamiltonian $H$. The surface $S_{t}$ is the image of the initial surface $S_{0}$ under this flow, i.e., $S_{t} = \\varphi_{t}(S_{0})$. The integral is $I(t) = \\int_{\\varphi_{t}(S_{0})} \\omega$. Using the change of variables formula for integration of differential forms, we can pull back the integral to the fixed domain $S_{0}$:\n$$\nI(t) = \\int_{S_{0}} (\\varphi_{t})^{*}\\omega\n$$\nwhere $(\\varphi_{t})^{*}$ is the pullback map induced by the flow $\\varphi_{t}$.\n\nTo demonstrate that $I(t)$ is an invariant, we must show that it is independent of time $t$. This is equivalent to showing that its time derivative is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}I(t) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\int_{S_{0}} (\\varphi_{t})^{*}\\omega = \\int_{S_{0}} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}(\\varphi_{t})^{*}\\omega\n$$\nThe time evolution of the pullback of a form under a flow generated by a vector field $X$ is given by the Lie derivative: $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}(\\varphi_{t})^{*}\\omega = (\\varphi_{t})^{*}(\\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\omega)$, where $X_H$ is the Hamiltonian vector field associated with $H$. Thus, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}I(t) = \\int_{S_{0}} (\\varphi_{t})^{*}(\\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\omega)\n$$\nThe integral $I(t)$ is constant if and only if the Lie derivative of the symplectic form $\\omega$ with respect to the Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ is zero, i.e., $\\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\omega = 0$. We now prove this from first principles.\n\nBy Cartan's \"magic\" formula, the Lie derivative of a differential form $\\alpha$ with respect to a vector field $X$ is given by $\\mathcal{L}_{X}\\alpha = \\mathrm{d}(i_{X}\\alpha) + i_{X}(\\mathrm{d}\\alpha)$, where $\\mathrm{d}$ is the exterior derivative and $i_{X}$ is the interior product. For our case, this becomes:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\omega = \\mathrm{d}(i_{X_H}\\omega) + i_{X_H}(\\mathrm{d}\\omega)\n$$\nA fundamental property of a symplectic form is that it is closed, meaning its exterior derivative is zero. Let's verify this for the given form $\\omega = \\mathrm{d}q_{1} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p_{1} + \\mathrm{d}q_{2} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p_{2}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\omega = \\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}q_{1} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p_{1}) + \\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}q_{2} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p_{2})\n$$\nUsing the property $\\mathrm{d}(\\alpha \\wedge \\beta) = \\mathrm{d}\\alpha \\wedge \\beta - \\alpha \\wedge \\mathrm{d}\\beta$ and the fact that the exterior derivative of an exact form $\\mathrm{d}f$ is zero (i.e., $\\mathrm{d}^{2}=0$), we get:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}q_{1} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p_{1}) = (\\mathrm{d}^{2}q_{1}) \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p_{1} - \\mathrm{d}q_{1} \\wedge (\\mathrm{d}^{2}p_{1}) = 0 - 0 = 0\n$$\nSimilarly, $\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}q_{2} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p_{2})=0$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{d}\\omega = 0$. The symplectic form is closed. This implies that the second term in Cartan's formula vanishes: $i_{X_H}(\\mathrm{d}\\omega) = i_{X_H}(0) = 0$.\n\nWe are left with $\\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\omega = \\mathrm{d}(i_{X_H}\\omega)$. The Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ is, by definition, the unique vector field that satisfies the relation $i_{X_H}\\omega = \\mathrm{d}H$. Substituting this into our expression for the Lie derivative:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\omega = \\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}H) = \\mathrm{d}^{2}H\n$$\nSince the operator $\\mathrm{d}$ has the property that its square is identically zero ($\\mathrm{d}^{2} = 0$), we have $\\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\omega = 0$.\n\nSince $\\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\\omega = 0$, we have $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}I(t) = \\int_{S_{0}} (\\varphi_{t})^{*}(0) = 0$. This confirms that $I(t)$ is a constant, independent of $t$. Therefore, $I(t)$ is an absolute integral invariant of the flow. This invariance is a general property of all Hamiltonian flows and is a statement of Poincaré's theorem on integral invariants (specifically, that $\\omega$ is an absolute integral invariant).\n\nTo find the value of $I(t)$, we can simply compute it at any time, for instance at $t=0$:\n$$\nI(t) = I(0) = \\int_{S_{0}}\\omega\n$$\nThe surface $S_{0}$ is an oriented parallelogram in $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ spanned by the vectors $v_{1} = (1,\\,0,\\,2,\\,-1)$ and $v_{2} = (0,\\,2,\\,1,\\,3)$.

A necessary condition for a $k$-form to be exact ($\\alpha = d\\beta$) is that it must be closed ($d\\alpha = d(d\\beta) = 0$).\n\nNext, we consider the restriction of $\\alpha$ to the submanifold $N = \\{(q,p) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid p=0\\}$. Let $i: N \\hookrightarrow M$ be the inclusion map. A point in $N$ is uniquely specified by its $q$ coordinate, so we can parameterize $N$ by $q$. The inclusion map is $i(q) = (q, 0)$. The restricted form is the pullback $i^{*}\\alpha$:\n$$\ni^{*}\\alpha = i^{*}(p\\,dq) = (i^{*}p) d(i^{*}q)\n$$\nThe pullback of the function $p$ to $N$, denoted $i^{*}p$, is the function $p$ evaluated on the points of $N$. On $N$, the coordinate $p$ is identically zero. Thus, $i^{*}p = 0$. The pullback of the function $q$ is simply $q$ itself, so $i^*q = q$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $i^{*}\\alpha$:\n$$\ni^{*}\\alpha = (0) d(q) = 0\n$$\nThe result is the zero $1$-form on $N$.

Let the endpoints of $\\gamma_t$ be $z_{start}(t)$ and $z_{end}(t)$.\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{dt} = \\left[-\\frac{1}{2}p^2\\right]_{z_{start}(t)}^{z_{end}(t)} = -\\frac{1}{2} [p(z_{end}(t))]^2 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} [p(z_{start}(t))]^2\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that the endpoints of $\\gamma_t$ remain in the submanifold $N$ for all $t$. The submanifold $N$ is defined by $p=0$. Therefore, at the endpoints, $p(z_{start}(t))=0$ and $p(z_{end}(t))=0$. This gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{2}(0)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(0)^2 = 0\n$$\nSince $\\frac{dI}{dt}=0$ for all $t$, the quantity $I(t)$ is independent of $t$; it is an invariant.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of the invariant $I(0)$**\n\nSince $I(t)$ is a constant, its value is equal to its value at $t=0$, which is $I(0) = \\int_{\\gamma_0} \\alpha$. We are given a piecewise smooth path $\\gamma_0$, which is the union of three segments: $\\gamma_0 = \\gamma_0^{(1)} \\cup \\gamma_0^{(2)} \\cup \\gamma_0^{(3)}$. The integral is the sum of the integrals over each segment:\n$$\nI(0) = \\int_{\\gamma_0^{(1)}} p\\,dq + \\int_{\\gamma_0^{(2)}} p\\,dq + \\int_{\\gamma_0^{(3)}} p\\,dq\n$$\nWe compute each integral using the given parameterizations. The integral of $p\\,dq$ over a parameterized curve $(q(\\lambda), p(\\lambda))$ is $\\int p(\\lambda) \\frac{dq}{d\\lambda} d\\lambda$.\n\nSegment $\\gamma_0^{(1)}$: $q(\\lambda)=0$, $p(\\lambda)=\\lambda A$ for $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$.\nHere, $q(\\lambda)=0$, so $\\frac{dq}{d\\lambda}=0$. The integrand is zero.\n$$\n\\int_{\\gamma_0^{(1)}} p\\,dq = \\int_0^1 (\\lambda A) (0) d\\lambda = 0\n$$\n\nSegment $\\gamma_0^{(2)}$: $q(\\lambda)=\\lambda Q$, $p(\\lambda)=A$ for $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$.\nHere, $q(\\lambda)=\\lambda Q$, so $\\frac{dq}{d\\lambda}=Q$. The value of $p$ is constant, $p(\\lambda)=A$.\n$$\n\\int_{\\gamma_0^{(2)}} p\\,dq = \\int_0^1 (A) (Q) d\\lambda = AQ \\int_0^1 d\\lambda = AQ [\\lambda]_0^1 = AQ\n$$\n\nSegment $\\gamma_0^{(3)}$: $q(\\lambda)=Q$, $p(\\lambda)=A(1-\\lambda)$ for $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$.\nHere, $q(\\lambda)=Q$, so $\\frac{dq}{d\\lambda}=0$. The integrand is zero.\n$$\n\\int_{\\gamma_0^{(3)}} p\\,dq = \\int_0^1 A(1-\\lambda) (0) d\\lambda = 0\n$$\n\nSumming the results for the three segments:\n$$\nI(0) = 0 + AQ + 0 = AQ\n$$\nThe value of the invariant is $AQ$.",
