            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It presents a standard derivation in the context of geometric mechanics on tangent bundles. All definitions and conditions are standard and provide a self-contained setup for a unique and meaningful solution. We proceed with the derivation as requested.\n\nThe configuration space is $Q = \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with global Cartesian coordinates $(q^{i})$ for $i=1, \\dots, n$. The tangent bundle $TQ$ has induced global coordinates $(q^{i}, v^{i})$, where a point $(q, v) \\in TQ$ corresponds to coordinates $(q^{1}, \\dots, q^{n}, v^{1}, \\dots, v^{n})$. The tangent space to $TQ$ at a point $(q,v)$, denoted $T_{(q,v)}TQ$, is a $2n$-dimensional real vector space with the natural basis $\\left\\{\\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}}\\right|_{(q,v)}, \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}\\right|_{(q,v)}\\right\\}_{i=1,\\dots,n}$.\n\n**1. Coordinate Expression of the Tangent Structure $J$**\n\nThe tangent structure $J$ is a $(1,1)$-tensor on $TQ$. We determine its action on the basis vectors of $TTQ$. Let $Y \\in T_{(q,v)}TQ$ be an arbitrary tangent vector, which can be expressed in coordinates as\n$$\nY = Y^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}} + \\tilde{Y}^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}\n$$\nwhere summation over repeated indices from $1$ to $n$ is implied.\n\nThe canonical projection is $\\tau: TQ \\to Q$, given in coordinates by $\\tau(q,v) = q$. Its tangent map $T\\tau: TTQ \\to TQ$ acts on the basis vectors as follows. For a coordinate chart on $Q$, say $\\phi: U \\subset Q \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$, with coordinates $q^i$, the projection map is $\\tau^j(q,v) = q^j$.\nThe action of $T\\tau$ on the basis vectors of $T_{(q,v)}TQ$ is:\n$$\nT\\tau \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial \\tau^{j}}{\\partial q^{i}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{j}} = \\delta_{i}^{j} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{j}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}} \\in T_{q}Q\n$$\n$$\nT\\tau \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial \\tau^{j}}{\\partial v^{i}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{j}} = 0 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{j}} = 0 \\in T_{q}Q\n$$\nApplying $T\\tau$ to the general vector $Y$ yields:\n$$\nT\\tau(Y) = Y^{i} T\\tau\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}}\\right) + \\tilde{Y}^{i} T\\tau\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}\\right) = Y^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}}\n$$\nThe components of $T\\tau(Y) \\in T_qQ$ in the basis $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^i}\\}$ are $(Y^1, \\dots, Y^n)$.\n\nThe vertical subbundle $V(TQ)$ is the kernel of $T\\tau$. A vector $Y$ is in $V_{(q,v)}(TQ)$ if $T\\tau(Y) = 0$, which implies $Y^i=0$ for all $i$. Thus, the vertical subbundle at $(q,v)$ is spanned by $\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}\\right\\}$, i.e., $V_{(q,v)}(TQ) = \\text{span}\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}\\right\\}_{i=1,\\dots,n}$.\n\nThe canonical identification $V_{(q,v)}(TQ) \\cong T_{q}Q$ maps the basis vector $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}$ to $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}}$.\nAccording to the definition, for any $Y \\in TTQ$, $J(Y)$ is a vertical vector. Therefore, it must be of the form $J(Y) = C^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}$ for some coefficients $C^i$. The definition further states that the fiber component of $J(Y)$ under the canonical identification equals $T\\tau(Y)$. The fiber component of $J(Y)$ is the vector $C^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}} \\in T_{q}Q$.\nEquating this with our expression for $T\\tau(Y)$:\n$$\nC^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}} = Y^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}} \\implies C^{i} = Y^{i}\n$$\nSo, for $Y = Y^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}} + \\tilde{Y}^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}$, we have $J(Y) = Y^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}$.\n\nWe can now find the action of $J$ on the basis vectors:\nFor $Y = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{j}}$, we have $Y^{i} = \\delta_{j}^{i}$ and $\\tilde{Y}^{i} = 0$. Thus, $J\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{j}}\\right) = \\delta_{j}^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{j}}$.\nFor $Y = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{j}}$, we have $Y^{i} = 0$ and $\\tilde{Y}^{i} = \\delta_{j}^{i}$. Thus, $J\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{j}}\\right) = 0 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}} = 0$.\n\nA general $(1,1)$-tensor can be written as $T = T_{\\beta}^{\\alpha} \\, \\partial_{\\alpha} \\otimes dx^{\\beta}$. In our case, $J$ acts on any vector field $Y$ as $J(Y) = Y^i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^i}$. Since $Y^i = dq^i(Y)$, we can write $J(Y) = dq^i(Y) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^i}$. This implies that the tensor $J$ has the coordinate representation:\n$$\nJ = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}} \\otimes dq^{i}\n$$\n\n**2. Coordinate Expression of the Liouville Vector Field $\\Delta$**\n\nThe Liouville vector field $\\Delta$ is defined as the infinitesimal generator of the fiberwise scalar multiplication flow $\\Phi_s(q,v) = (q, sv)$. By definition,\n$$\n\\Delta_{(q,v)} = \\left.\\frac{d}{ds}\\right|_{s=1} \\Phi_s(q,v) = \\left.\\frac{d}{ds}\\right|_{s=1} (q, sv)\n$$\nLet a curve in $TQ$ be given by $\\gamma(s) = (q^{1}, \\dots, q^{n}, s v^{1}, \\dots, s v^{n})$. The tangent vector to this curve is calculated by differentiating its components with respect to $s$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\gamma(s)}{ds} = \\left( \\frac{dq^{1}}{ds}, \\dots, \\frac{dq^{n}}{ds}, \\frac{d(sv^{1})}{ds}, \\dots, \\frac{d(sv^{n})}{ds} \\right) = (0, \\dots, 0, v^{1}, \\dots, v^{n})\n$$\nThe tangent vector field is formed by multiplying these components by the basis vectors. The derivative is independent of $s$, so evaluating at $s=1$ gives the components of $\\Delta$ at $(q,v)$:\n$$\n\\Delta_{(q,v)} = 0 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}} + v^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}} = v^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}\n$$\nThis defines the vector field $\\Delta$ at every point of $TQ$. Its coordinate expression is:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} v^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}\n$$\n\n**3. Verification of $J(X) = \\Delta$ for a Newtonian SODE**\n\nA Second-Order Differential Equation (SODE) vector field on $TQ$ is a vector field $X$ whose integral curves $t \\mapsto c(t) = (q(t), v(t))$ represent the solutions of a system of second-order ordinary differential equations on $Q$. This requires the condition $v(t) = \\frac{dq}{dt}(t)$ to hold along any integral curve.\n\nLet the general form of a vector field on $TQ$ be $X = X^{i}(q,v) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}} + \\tilde{X}^{i}(q,v) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}$. The integral curves $(q^{i}(t), v^{i}(t))$ of $X$ satisfy the system:\n$$\n\\frac{dq^{i}}{dt} = X^{i}(q(t), v(t))\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dv^{i}}{dt} = \\tilde{X}^{i}(q(t), v(t))\n$$\nThe condition $v^{i}(t) = \\frac{dq^{i}}{dt}(t)$ implies that the components of the vector field must satisfy $X^{i}(q,v) = v^{i}$. Therefore, any SODE vector field $X$ on $TQ$ must have the general form:\n$$\nX = v^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}} + a^{i}(q,v) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}\n$$\nwhere $a^{i}(q,v) = \\tilde{X}^{i}(q,v)$ are the acceleration components.\n\nFor a Newtonian system on $Q=\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with a standard Euclidean metric and a potential $V(q)$, the kinetic energy is $T = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i (v^i)^2$ (or $\\frac{1}{2}m|v|^2$ if mass is uniform) and the force is $F_i = -\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial q^i}$. Newton's second law is $m_i \\ddot{q}^i = F_i$, so $\\ddot{q}^i = \\frac{F_i}{m_i}$. The acceleration components are $a^i(q) = -\\frac{1}{m_i}\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial q^i}$. Thus, the specific SODE vector field for this system is:\n$$\nX = v^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}} - \\left(\\frac{1}{m_i}\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial q^i}\\right) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}\n$$\nWe are asked to verify that $J(X)=\\Delta$ holds. We apply the tensor $J$ to the general form of a SODE vector field $X$. Using the linearity of $J$ and its action on the basis vectors derived in Part 1:\n$$\nJ(X) = J\\left(v^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}} + a^{i}(q,v) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nJ(X) = v^{i} J\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}}\\right) + a^{i}(q,v) J\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $J\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}$ and $J\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}\\right) = 0$:\n$$\nJ(X) = v^{i} \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}\\right) + a^{i}(q,v) \\cdot 0 = v^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}\n$$\nThe result $v^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}$ is precisely the coordinate expression for the Liouville vector field $\\Delta$ derived in Part 2.\n$$\nJ(X) = \\Delta\n$$\nThis verification holds for any SODE vector field, as the result only depends on the components $X^i=v^i$ and is independent of the acceleration terms $a^i(q,v)$, which are annihilated by $J$. Therefore, it is true for the specific case of a Newtonian system with a potential $V(q)$. This confirms the fundamental geometric property that defines a SODE vector field.\n\nThe final answer provides the coordinate expressions for the ordered pair $(J, \\Delta)$.",

            "problem": "Let $Q$ be a smooth, finite-dimensional manifold and let $TQ$ and $TTQ$ denote its tangent bundle and the tangent bundle of the tangent bundle, respectively. Denote by $\\tau_{Q}: TQ \\to Q$ the bundle projection, by $\\tau_{TQ}: TTQ \\to TQ$ the canonical bundle projection, and by $T\\tau_{Q}: TTQ \\to TQ$ the tangent map of $\\tau_{Q}$.

The structure is pedagogical, guiding the solver through steps that build upon each other, culminating in a final calculation that relies on the previously verified relations.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested. First, we find the local coordinate expressions for the vector field lifts and the canonical structures. Second, we verify the given identities. Third, we compute the final expression for $S(X)(q,v)$.\n\nLet the local coordinate expression for the vector field $X \\in \\mathfrak{X}(Q)$ be $X = X^{i}(q) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}}$. We use the Einstein summation convention.\n\n**1. Coordinate Expressions for Lifts and Canonical Structures**\n\n**Vertical Lift $X^{V}$**:\nThe vertical lift $X^{V}$ is a vector field on $TQ$. At a point $(q, v) \\in TQ$, its value $X^{V}_{(q,v)}$ is the vertical vector in $T_{(q,v)}(TQ)$ corresponding to the vector $X(q) \\in T_{q}Q$. The basis of vertical vectors at $(q,v)$ is $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}\\}$. The components of $X(q)$ in the basis $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}}\\}$ are $X^{i}(q)$. Thus, the vertical lift is:\n$$\nX^{V} = X^{i}(q) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}\n$$\n\n**Complete Lift $X^{C}$**:\nThe complete lift $X^{C}$ is the infinitesimal generator of the tangent flow $T\\phi_{t}: TQ \\to TQ$, where $\\phi_{t}$ is the flow of $X$. If $(q(t), v(t)) = T\\phi_{t}(q_{0}, v_{0})$, then $\\frac{dq^{i}}{dt} = X^{i}(q(t))$ and $\\frac{dv^{i}}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial X^{i}}{\\partial q^{j}} v^{j}$. The vector field $X^{C}$ is given by evaluating these derivatives at any point $(q,v)$:\n$$\nX^{C} = \\dot{q}^{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}} + \\dot{v}^{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}} = X^{i}(q) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}} + v^{j} \\frac{\\partial X^{i}}{\\partial q^{j}}(q) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}\n$$\n\n**Canonical Structures in Coordinates**:\n- **Liouville Vector Field $\\Delta$**: This generates fiber dilations $\\sigma_{s}(q,v) = (q, sv)$. Its expression is $\\Delta = \\left.\\frac{d}{ds}\\right|_{s=1} (q^{i}, sv^{i}) = v^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}$.\n- **Vertical Endomorphism $J$**: An element $W = \\dot{q}^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}} + \\dot{v}^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}} \\in T_{(q,v)}(TQ)$ is in the kernel of $T\\tau_{Q}$ if its horizontal part is zero, i.e., $\\dot{q}^{i}=0$. The map $J$ projects onto the vertical space in a specific way. In coordinates, $J$ acts on the basis vectors of $T_{(q,v)}(TQ)$ as $J(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}}) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}$ and $J(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}) = 0$.\n- **Canonical Involution $\\kappa_{Q}$**: This map swaps the fiber coordinate $v$ with the fiber velocity $\\dot{q}$ in the second tangent bundle $TTQ$. An element of $TTQ$ with coordinates $(q^{i}, v^{i}; \\dot{q}^{i}, \\dot{v}^{i})$ is mapped as:\n$$\n\\kappa_{Q}: (q^{i}, v^{i}; \\dot{q}^{i}, \\dot{v}^{i}) \\mapsto (q^{i}, \\dot{q}^{i}; v^{i}, \\dot{v}^{i})\n$$\nThis map exchanges the base point vector component in $TQ$ with the tangent vector component in $T_qQ$.\n\n**2. Verification of Identities**\n\n**Identity 1: $J(X^{C}) = X^{V}$**\nWe apply $J$ to the coordinate expression of $X^{C}$:\n$$\nJ(X^{C}) = J\\left( X^{i}(q) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}} + v^{j} \\frac{\\partial X^{i}}{\\partial q^{j}}(q) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the linearity of $J$ and its action on the basis vectors:\n$$\nJ(X^{C}) = X^{i}(q) J\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}}\\right) + v^{j} \\frac{\\partial X^{i}}{\\partial q^{j}}(q) J\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}\\right) = X^{i}(q) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}} + v^{j} \\frac{\\partial X^{i}}{\\partial q^{j}}(q) (0) = X^{i}(q) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}\n$$\nThis is precisely the coordinate expression for $X^{V}$. Thus, the identity $J(X^{C}) = X^{V}$ is verified.\n\n**Identity 2: $[\\,\\Delta, X^{V}\\,] = -\\,X^{V}$**\nWe compute the Lie bracket of $\\Delta = v^{j} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{j}}$ and $X^{V} = X^{k}(q) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{k}}$ (using different indices for clarity):\n$$\n[\\,\\Delta, X^{V}\\,] = \\left[ v^{j} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{j}}, X^{k}(q) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{k}} \\right]\n$$\nUsing the Lie bracket formula $[fA, gB] = f(A g) B - g(B f) A + fg[A,B]$ with $f=v^{j}$, $g=X^{k}(q)$, $A=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{j}}$, $B=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{k}}$:\n$$\n[\\,\\Delta, X^{V}\\,] = v^{j} \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{j}} X^{k}(q)\\right) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{k}} - X^{k}(q) \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{k}} v^{j}\\right) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{j}} + v^{j}X^{k}(q) \\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{j}}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{k}}\\right]\n$$\nThe first term is zero because $X^{k}(q)$ does not depend on $v^{j}$. The commutator in the third term is zero. For the second term, $\\frac{\\partial v^{j}}{\\partial v^{k}} = \\delta^{j}_{k}$ (Kronecker delta).\n$$\n[\\,\\Delta, X^{V}\\,] = 0 - X^{k}(q) \\delta^{j}_{k} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{j}} + 0 = -X^{j}(q) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{j}}\n$$\nThis is precisely the coordinate expression for $-X^{V}$. Thus, the identity $[\\,\\Delta, X^{V}\\,] = -\\,X^{V}$ is verified.\n\n**Identity 3: $\\kappa_{Q}\\big(X_*(v)\\big) = X^{C}(q,v)$**\nThe expression $X_*(v)$ is the pushforward of a vector $v \\in T_qQ$ by the vector field $X$ (viewed as a map from $Q$ to $TQ$). To compute this in coordinates, we consider a curve $\\gamma(t)$ in $Q$ with $\\gamma(0)=q$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}(0)=v=v^j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^j}$. The pushforward is the tangent vector to the curve $X(\\gamma(t))$ in $TQ$ at $t=0$.\nThe base point of this vector in $TQ$ is $X(q)$. The vector part is $\\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0} X(\\gamma(t))$. This corresponds to a point in $TTQ$ with coordinates $(q^i, X^i(q); \\dot{q}^i, \\dot{X}^i)$, where $\\dot{q}^i=v^i$ and $\\dot{X}^i = \\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0} X^i(\\gamma(t)) = \\frac{\\partial X^i}{\\partial q^j} \\frac{d\\gamma^j}{dt}|_{t=0} = \\frac{\\partial X^i}{\\partial q^j}v^j$.\nSo, $X_*(v)$ corresponds to the point in $TTQ$ with coordinates $(q^{i}, X^{i}(q); v^{i}, \\frac{\\partial X^{k}}{\\partial q^{j}}v^{j})$. We apply $\\kappa_{Q}$ to this point:\n$$\n\\kappa_{Q}\\left( q^{i}, X^{i}(q); v^{i}, \\frac{\\partial X^{k}}{\\partial q^{j}}v^{j} \\right) = \\left( q^{i}, v^{i}; X^{i}(q), \\frac{\\partial X^{k}}{\\partial q^{j}}v^{j} \\right)\n$$\nThis resulting point in $TTQ$ represents a tangent vector at the base point $(q^{i}, v^{i})$ in $TQ$, with vector components $(\\dot{q}^{i}, \\dot{v}^{i}) = (X^{i}(q), \\frac{\\partial X^{k}}{\\partial q^{j}}v^{j})$. This corresponds to the vector field:\n$$\nX^{i}(q) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}} + v^{j} \\frac{\\partial X^{i}}{\\partial q^{j}}(q) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}\n$$\nThis is precisely the coordinate expression for $X^{C}(q,v)$. Thus, the identity $\\kappa_{Q}\\big(X_*(v)\\big) = X^{C}(q,v)$ is verified.\n\n**3. Computation of $S(X)(q,v)$**\n\nThe expression is defined as:\n$$\nS(X)(q,v) \\;:=\\; J\\big(X^{C}(q,v)\\big) \\;+\\; [\\,\\Delta, X^{V}\\,](q,v) \\;+\\; \\Big(X^{C}(q,v) - \\kappa_{Q}\\big(X_*(v)\\big)\\Big)\n$$\nWe substitute the results from the verified identities. The vector $v$ in $X_*(v)$ is the velocity component of the point $(q,v)$:\n- $J(X^{C}(q,v)) = X^{V}(q,v)$\n- $[\\,\\Delta, X^{V}\\,](q,v) = -X^{V}(q,v)$\n- $X^{C}(q,v) - \\kappa_{Q}\\big(X_*(v)\\big) = X^{C}(q,v) - X^{C}(q,v) = 0$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $S(X)(q,v)$:\n$$\nS(X)(q,v) = X^{V}(q,v) + (-X^{V}(q,v)) + 0\n$$\n$$\nS(X)(q,v) = X^{V}(q,v) - X^{V}(q,v) = 0\n$$\nThe result is the zero vector in $T_{(q,v)}(TQ)$. The expression is identically zero for any choice of manifold $Q$ and vector field $X$.\nWe can confirm this by summing the coordinate representations of each term:\n$$\nS(X)(q,v) = \\left( X^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}} \\right) + \\left( -X^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}} \\right) + \\left( \\left(X^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}} + v^{j} \\frac{\\partial X^{i}}{\\partial q^{j}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}\\right) - \\left(X^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}} + v^{j} \\frac{\\partial X^{i}}{\\partial q^{j}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{i}}\\right) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nS(X)(q,v) = 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\nThe final result is the zero vector. As an analytic expression, this is simply $0$.",
