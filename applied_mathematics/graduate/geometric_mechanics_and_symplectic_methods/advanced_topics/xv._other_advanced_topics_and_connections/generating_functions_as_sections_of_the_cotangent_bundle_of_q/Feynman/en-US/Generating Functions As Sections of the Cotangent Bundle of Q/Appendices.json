            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and self-contained, situated within the standard mathematical framework of differential geometry and Morse theory. We shall proceed by following the three specified steps.\n\nLet the smooth manifold be $Q = \\mathbb{R}^{4}$ with global coordinates $(q_{1}, q_{2}, q_{3}, q_{4})$. The smooth function $S: Q \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is given by\n$$\nS(q_{1}, q_{2}, q_{3}, q_{4}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(-2 q_{1}^{2} - q_{2}^{2} + 3 q_{3}^{2} + 5 q_{4}^{2}\\right) + q_{1} q_{2} + 2 q_{3} q_{4}.\n$$\nThe Lagrangian section $\\Lambda$ is the graph of the exact $1$-form $dS$.\n\n**1. Critical Points and Nondegeneracy**\n\nA point $q_{0} \\in Q$ is a critical point of $S$ if the differential $dS$ vanishes at $q_{0}$. In local coordinates, this means all first partial derivatives of $S$ are zero at $q_{0}$. We compute the gradient of $S$:\n$$\n\\nabla S = \\left( \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial q_{1}}, \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial q_{2}}, \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial q_{3}}, \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial q_{4}} \\right).\n$$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial q_{1}} = -2 q_{1} + q_{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial q_{2}} = -q_{2} + q_{1}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial q_{3}} = 3 q_{3} + 2 q_{4}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial q_{4}} = 5 q_{4} + 2 q_{3}\n$$\nSetting these derivatives to zero gives a system of linear equations:\n\\begin{align*}\n-2 q_{1} + q_{2} &= 0 \\\\\nq_{1} - q_{2} &= 0 \\\\\n3 q_{3} + 2 q_{4} &= 0 \\\\\n2 q_{3} + 5 q_{4} &= 0\n\\end{align*}\nFrom the first two equations, $q_{2} = 2 q_{1}$ and $q_{1} = q_{2}$. This implies $q_{1} = 2 q_{1}$, which means $q_{1} = 0$, and consequently $q_{2} = 0$.\nFrom the third equation, $q_{4} = -\\frac{3}{2} q_{3}$. Substituting this into the fourth equation gives $2 q_{3} + 5(-\\frac{3}{2} q_{3}) = 0$, which simplifies to $2 q_{3} - \\frac{15}{2} q_{3} = 0$, or $-\\frac{11}{2} q_{3} = 0$. This implies $q_{3} = 0$, and consequently $q_{4} = 0$.\nThus, there is a single critical point at $q_{0} = (0, 0, 0, 0)$.\n\nA critical point is nondegenerate if the Hessian matrix of $S$ evaluated at that point is invertible. The Hessian matrix, $H = \\mathrm{Hess}(S)$, has entries $H_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial^2 S}{\\partial q_i \\partial q_j}$. As $S$ is a quadratic function, its Hessian is a constant matrix.\n$$\nH = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 S}{\\partial q_{1}^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 S}{\\partial q_{1} \\partial q_{2}} & \\frac{\\partial^2 S}{\\partial q_{1} \\partial q_{3}} & \\frac{\\partial^2 S}{\\partial q_{1} \\partial q_{4}} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 S}{\\partial q_{2} \\partial q_{1}} & \\frac{\\partial^2 S}{\\partial q_{2}^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 S}{\\partial q_{2} \\partial q_{3}} & \\frac{\\partial^2 S}{\\partial q_{2} \\partial q_{4}} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 S}{\\partial q_{3} \\partial q_{1}} & \\frac{\\partial^2 S}{\\partial q_{3} \\partial q_{2}} & \\frac{\\partial^2 S}{\\partial q_{3}^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 S}{\\partial q_{3} \\partial q_{4}} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 S}{\\partial q_{4} \\partial q_{1}} & \\frac{\\partial^2 S}{\\partial q_{4} \\partial q_{2}} & \\frac{\\partial^2 S}{\\partial q_{4} \\partial q_{3}} & \\frac{\\partial^2 S}{\\partial q_{4}^2}\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-2 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 3 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 2 & 5\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe determinant of this block-diagonal matrix is the product of the determinants of the diagonal blocks:\n$$\n\\det(H) = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} -2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 5 \\end{pmatrix} = ((-2)(-1) - (1)(1)) \\cdot ((3)(5) - (2)(2)) = (2-1)(15-4) = (1)(11) = 11.\n$$\nSince $\\det(H) = 11 \\neq 0$, the Hessian is invertible. Therefore, the critical point $q_{0} = (0, 0, 0, 0)$ is nondegenerate.\n\n**2. Morse Index**\n\nThe Morse index of $S$ at a critical point is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at that point. We need to find the eigenvalues of $H$. Due to the block-diagonal structure, we can find the eigenvalues of each $2 \\times 2$ block separately.\n\nFor the first block, $H_{11} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$, the characteristic equation is $\\det(H_{11} - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$\n(-2-\\lambda)(-1-\\lambda) - 1 = \\lambda^2 + 3\\lambda + 2 - 1 = \\lambda^2 + 3\\lambda + 1 = 0.\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}$. Since $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.236$, both eigenvalues $\\lambda_{1} = \\frac{-3+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $\\lambda_{2} = \\frac{-3-\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ are negative.\n\nFor the second block, $H_{22} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 5 \\end{pmatrix}$, the characteristic equation is $\\det(H_{22} - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$\n(3-\\lambda)(5-\\lambda) - 4 = \\lambda^2 - 8\\lambda + 15 - 4 = \\lambda^2 - 8\\lambda + 11 = 0.\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{(-8)^2 - 4(1)(11)}}{2} = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{64-44}}{2} = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2} = 4 \\pm \\sqrt{5}$. Since $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.236  4$, both eigenvalues $\\lambda_{3} = 4+\\sqrt{5}$ and $\\lambda_{4} = 4-\\sqrt{5}$ are positive.\n\nThe set of eigenvalues of $H$ is $\\{\\frac{-3+\\sqrt{5}}{2}, \\frac{-3-\\sqrt{5}}{2}, 4+\\sqrt{5}, 4-\\sqrt{5}\\}$. There are exactly two negative eigenvalues.\nTherefore, the Morse index of $S$ at the critical point $q_{0}=(0,0,0,0)$ is $2$.\n\n**3. Geometric Interpretation**\n\nThe Lagrangian section $\\Lambda = \\operatorname{graph}(dS)$ intersects the zero section $Z = \\{(q, 0) \\mid q \\in Q\\}$ at points $(q, p) \\in T^*Q$ where $p = dS(q) = 0$. This corresponds precisely to the critical points of $S$. In our case, the only intersection point is $(q_{0}, 0) = ((0,0,0,0), 0)$.\n\nThe tangent space to $\\Lambda$ at this intersection point is $T_{(q_{0}, 0)}\\Lambda = \\{(v, \\mathrm{Hess}_{q_{0}}(S)\\cdot v) : v \\in T_{q_{0}}Q\\}$, and the tangent space to the zero section is $T_{(q_{0}, 0)}Z = \\{(v, 0) : v \\in T_{q_{0}}Q\\}$. The intersection of these two tangent spaces is transverse if $T_{(q_{0}, 0)}\\Lambda \\cap T_{(q_{0}, 0)}Z = \\{0\\}$. This requires that if $(v, \\mathrm{Hess}_{q_{0}}(S)\\cdot v) = (v, 0)$, then $v=0$. This is equivalent to requiring that $\\mathrm{Hess}_{q_{0}}(S)\\cdot v = 0$ implies $v=0$, which is true if and only if $\\mathrm{Hess}_{q_{0}}(S)$ is invertible. As we have shown $\\det(H) \\neq 0$, the intersection is transverse.\n\nThe Morse index describes the local geometry of this intersection. By the Morse Lemma, there exist local coordinates $(y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4)$ near $q_0$ such that $S$ takes the form\n$$\nS(y) = S(q_0) - \\frac{1}{2}(y_1^2 + y_2^2) + \\frac{1}{2}(y_3^2 + y_4^2),\n$$\nwhere the number of negative terms corresponds to the Morse index, which is $2$.\nIn these coordinates, the section $\\Lambda$ is given by $p_i = \\partial S/\\partial y_i$, so $p_1 = -y_1$, $p_2 = -y_2$, $p_3 = y_3$, $p_4 = y_4$.\nThe Hessian matrix in these coordinates is $\\mathrm{diag}(-1, -1, 1, 1)$, which has signature $(2, 2)$ (number of positive, number of negative eigenvalues). The Morse index is the number of negative eigenvalues, $k=2$.\n\nThe \"local intersection orientation\" can be described by a quadratic form on $T_{q_0}Q$ that measures the discrepancy between $T\\Lambda$ and $TZ$. This form is given by $B(v,v) = - \\langle v, \\mathrm{Hess}_{q_0}(S) \\cdot v \\rangle$. The signature of this form is $(k, n-k)$, where $n=\\dim Q=4$ and $k$ is the Morse index. In our case, the signature is $(2, 2)$.\n\nThe projection $\\pi: T^*Q \\to Q$ maps $(q,p) \\mapsto q$. Its restriction to $\\Lambda$, $\\pi|_\\Lambda: \\Lambda \\to Q$, is a local diffeomorphism around the critical point because its differential is an isomorphism (a consequence of the non-degeneracy of the Hessian). The Morse index does not affect the local diffeomorphic nature of the projection itself, but rather describes how the section $\\Lambda$ is \"tilted\" with respect to the zero section $Z$. A Morse index of $k=2$ means that locally, $\\Lambda$ is tilted \"downwards\" (momentum opposite to position displacement) in two directions and \"upwards\" (momentum aligned with position displacement) in the other two directions. This describes the local behavior of $\\Lambda$ relative to the base space $Q$ near the critical point.",

The one-form is given by $\\alpha = p(\\theta)\\,d\\theta$, where $p(\\theta)=3+2\\cos(\\theta)-\\sin(2\\theta)$. Since any one-form on a one-dimensional manifold is closed, the condition for the graph of $\\alpha$ to be a Lagrangian submanifold is automatically satisfied.\n\n**1. Evaluation of the period integral $\\int_{S^{1}}\\alpha$**\n\nThe de Rham cohomology group $H^{1}(S^{1};\\mathbb{R})$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$. An element of this group, the cohomology class $[\\alpha]$ of a closed one-form $\\alpha$, is represented by its period integral over a generator of the first homology group $H_{1}(S^{1};\\mathbb{Z})$, which is the circle itself. In the given coordinate $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, traversing the circle once corresponds to integrating from $\\theta=0$ to $\\theta=2\\pi$.\n\nThe period integral is therefore:\n$$\n\\int_{S^{1}}\\alpha = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} p(\\theta)\\,d\\theta = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} (3+2\\cos(\\theta)-\\sin(2\\theta))\\,d\\theta\n$$\nWe can evaluate this integral term by term:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} 3\\,d\\theta = [3\\theta]_{0}^{2\\pi} = 3(2\\pi) - 3(0) = 6\\pi\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} 2\\cos(\\theta)\\,d\\theta = [2\\sin(\\theta)]_{0}^{2\\pi} = 2\\sin(2\\pi) - 2\\sin(0) = 0 - 0 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} -\\sin(2\\theta)\\,d\\theta = \\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\cos(2\\theta)\\right]_{0}^{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(4\\pi) - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(0) = \\frac{1}{2}(1) - \\frac{1}{2}(1) = 0\n$$\nSumming these results, we find the value of the period integral:\n$$\n\\int_{S^{1}}\\alpha = 6\\pi + 0 + 0 = 6\\pi\n$$\n\n**2. Determination of the jump $\\widetilde{S}(\\theta+2\\pi)-\\widetilde{S}(\\theta)$**\n\nA generating function $S:Q \\to \\mathbb{R}$ for the Lagrangian section exists if and only if the one-form $\\alpha$ is exact, i.e., $\\alpha = dS$. By the Poincaré lemma, this is equivalent to $\\alpha$ being closed and having a trivial cohomology class, $[\\alpha] = 0$. From part 1, we found $\\int_{S^{1}}\\alpha = 6\\pi \\neq 0$, which implies that $[\\alpha]$ is non-trivial. Therefore, no single-valued generating function $S:S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ exists.\n\nInstead, we can define a multi-valued generating function, which is a single-valued function $\\widetilde{S}:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ on the universal cover $\\mathbb{R}$ of $S^1$. This function is defined by the relation $d\\widetilde{S} = \\pi^*\\alpha$, where $\\pi:\\mathbb{R} \\to S^1$ is the covering map. In the coordinate $\\theta$ on $\\mathbb{R}$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\widetilde{S}}{d\\theta} = p(\\theta) = 3+2\\cos(\\theta)-\\sin(2\\theta)\n$$\nThe change in $\\widetilde{S}$ as $\\theta$ increases by $2\\pi$ (corresponding to one full wrap around the base space $S^1$) is given by the fundamental theorem of calculus:\n$$\n\\widetilde{S}(\\theta+2\\pi)-\\widetilde{S}(\\theta) = \\int_{\\theta}^{\\theta+2\\pi} \\frac{d\\widetilde{S}}{d\\theta'}\\,d\\theta' = \\int_{\\theta}^{\\theta+2\\pi} p(\\theta')\\,d\\theta'\n$$\nSince the integrand $p(\\theta')$ is a $2\\pi$-periodic function of $\\theta'$, the value of the integral is independent of the starting point $\\theta$ and is equal to the integral over any interval of length $2\\pi$, such as $[0, 2\\pi]$. This is precisely the period integral calculated in part 1.\n$$\n\\widetilde{S}(\\theta+2\\pi)-\\widetilde{S}(\\theta) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} p(\\theta')\\,d\\theta' = 6\\pi\n$$\nThis non-zero jump, $6\\pi$, is the obstruction to $\\widetilde{S}$ being a periodic function. If the jump were zero, $\\widetilde{S}$ would be periodic with period $2\\pi$ and could therefore be considered as a single-valued function on $S^1$. The fact that the jump is non-zero confirms that no single-valued generating function exists on $S^1$. The value of the jump, $6\\pi$, is the period of the one-form and represents the non-trivial cohomology class $[\\alpha]$.\n\n**3. Computation of the winding number $w$**\n\nThe winding number $w$ is defined as:\n$$\nw \\coloneqq \\frac{\\widetilde{S}(\\theta+2\\pi)-\\widetilde{S}(\\theta)}{2\\pi}\n$$\nUsing the result from part 2, we can directly compute its value:\n$$\nw = \\frac{6\\pi}{2\\pi} = 3\n$$\nThis integer value $w=3$ quantifies the multi-valuedness of the generating function. It signifies that for every full traversal of the configuration space $S^1$, the value of the generating function increases by $3 \\times (2\\pi)$. Geometrically, if we were to plot the graph of the function $\\theta \\mapsto \\widetilde{S}(\\theta) \\pmod{2\\pi}$, this map from $S^1$ to $S^1$ would have a winding number of $3$.\n\nThe final answer requires reporting the two numbers $(\\int_{S^{1}}\\alpha, w)$.

Let us compute the Jacobian matrix $J$ of the map $\\pi_Q$:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{\\partial(x,y)}{\\partial(\\eta,y)} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\eta}  \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\eta}  \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -3\\eta^{2} - \\lambda  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe determinant of the Jacobian is $\\det(J) = -3\\eta^{2} - \\lambda$. The map $\\pi_Q$ is singular when $\\det(J) = 0$, which gives the condition:\n$$\n-3\\eta^{2} - \\lambda = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 3\\eta^{2} + \\lambda = 0.\n$$\nA cusp singularity is a specific type of degenerate singularity. In the classification of singularities of smooth maps between $2$-manifolds, generic singularities are folds (type $A_1$) and cusps (type $A_2$). A cusp occurs where the singularity condition itself is degenerate.\n\nThe behavior of the map $\\pi_Q$ is entirely governed by the component function $x(\\eta) = -\\eta^{3} - \\lambda\\eta$, since the $y$-component is the identity. A singularity occurs when the derivative of this function with respect to its active variable $\\eta$ vanishes:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{d\\eta} = -3\\eta^{2} - \\lambda = 0.\n$$\nA cusp singularity corresponds to a condition where not only the first derivative vanishes but also the second derivative. This indicates a higher-order tangency. We compute the second derivative of $x(\\eta)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}x}{d\\eta^{2}} = \\frac{d}{d\\eta}(-3\\eta^{2} - \\lambda) = -6\\eta.\n$$\nFor a cusp singularity, we require both the first and second derivatives to be zero simultaneously:\n1.  $\\frac{dx}{d\\eta} = -3\\eta^{2} - \\lambda = 0$\n2.  $\\frac{d^{2}x}{d\\eta^{2}} = -6\\eta = 0$\n\nFrom the second condition, we immediately find $\\eta = 0$. Substituting this value into the first condition gives:\n$$\n-3(0)^{2} - \\lambda = 0 \\implies -\\lambda = 0,\n$$\nwhich implies $\\lambda = 0$.\n\nTo confirm that this point corresponds to a cusp singularity (type $A_2$) and not a higher-order degeneracy (like a swallowtail, type $A_3$), we must check that the third derivative does not vanish at this point. The third derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{3}x}{d\\eta^{3}} = \\frac{d}{d\\eta}(-6\\eta) = -6.\n$$\nSince $\\frac{d^{3}x}{d\\eta^{3}} = -6 \\neq 0$ for all $\\eta$, the condition for a cusp singularity is satisfied precisely at $\\eta=0$ and $\\lambda=0$.\n\nThe value $\\lambda=0$ represents a bifurcation point.\n- For $\\lambda > 0$, the singularity condition $3\\eta^{2} + \\lambda = 0$ has no real solutions for $\\eta$. The projection $\\pi_Q$ is a local diffeomorphism, and there are no singularities.\n- For $\\lambda  0$, the condition $3\\eta^{2} + \\lambda = 0$ yields two distinct solutions $\\eta = \\pm\\sqrt{-\\lambda/3}$. At these points, $\\frac{dx}{d\\eta}=0$ but $\\frac{d^{2}x}{d\\eta^{2}} = -6\\eta \\neq 0$. These correspond to two lines of fold singularities on $L_\\lambda$.\n- At $\\lambda = 0$, the two lines of fold singularities merge into a single line (at $\\eta=0$) where the singularity is of the more degenerate cusp type.\n\nThe problem asks for the specific parameter value $\\lambda$ where the map develops cusp singularities. This occurs at the bifurcation value that separates the two regimes. Therefore, the required parameter value is $\\lambda=0$.",
