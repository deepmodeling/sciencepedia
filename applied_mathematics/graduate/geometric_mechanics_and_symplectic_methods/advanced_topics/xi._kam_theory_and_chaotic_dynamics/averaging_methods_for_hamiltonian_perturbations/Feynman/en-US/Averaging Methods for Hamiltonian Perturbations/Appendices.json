Canonical Transformation to Resonant Coordinates**\n\nThe unperturbed Hamiltonian is $H_{0}(I_{1},I_{2})=\\omega\\,(I_{1}+I_{2})$. The unperturbed frequencies of motion for the angles $\\theta_{1}$ and $\\theta_{2}$ are $\\dot{\\theta}_{1} = \\frac{\\partial H_{0}}{\\partial I_{1}} = \\omega$ and $\\dot{\\theta}_{2} = \\frac{\\partial H_{0}}{\\partial I_{2}} = \\omega$. The system is in a $1:1$ resonance, since the frequencies are equal. A combination of angles $k_{1}\\theta_{1} + k_{2}\\theta_{2}$ is resonant if $k_{1}\\omega + k_{2}\\omega = 0$, which implies $k_{1} + k_{2} = 0$. The simplest such non-trivial combination is $\\theta_{1} - \\theta_{2}$.\n\nWe introduce a canonical transformation to new coordinates $(\\phi, \\psi, J, K)$ where $\\phi$ is the slow resonant angle and $\\psi$ is a fast angle. We define the new angles as:\n$$\n\\phi = \\theta_{1} - \\theta_{2} \\\\\n\\psi = \\theta_{1} + \\theta_{2}\n$$\nThis transformation is generated by a type-II generating function $F_{2}(\\theta_{1}, \\theta_{2}, J, K)$. We choose a function linear in the new momenta $J$ and $K$ to produce the linear transformation for the angles above:\n$$\nF_{2}(\\theta_{1}, \\theta_{2}, J, K) = (\\theta_{1} - \\theta_{2})J + (\\theta_{1} + \\theta_{2})K\n$$\nThe transformation equations are given by $I_{i} = \\frac{\\partial F_{2}}{\\partial \\theta_{i}}$ for the old momenta and $\\phi = \\frac{\\partial F_{2}}{\\partial J}, \\psi = \\frac{\\partial F_{2}}{\\partial K}$ for the new angles. Applying these rules:\n$$\n\\phi = \\frac{\\partial F_{2}}{\\partial J} = \\theta_{1} - \\theta_{2} \\\\\n\\psi = \\frac{\\partial F_{2}}{\\partial K} = \\theta_{1} + \\theta_{2}\n$$\nThis confirms our choice of $F_{2}$ generates the correct new angles. For the momenta, we find:\n$$\nI_{1} = \\frac{\\partial F_{2}}{\\partial \\theta_{1}} = J + K \\\\\nI_{2} = \\frac{\\partial F_{2}}{\\partial \\theta_{2}} = -J + K\n$$\nWe can invert these relations to express the old variables in terms of the new ones:\n$$\nI_{1} = K + J, \\quad I_{2} = K - J \\\\\n\\theta_{1} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\psi + \\phi), \\quad \\theta_{2} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\psi - \\phi)\n$$\nThe new momenta in terms of the old actions are $J = \\frac{1}{2}(I_{1}-I_{2})$ and $K = \\frac{1}{2}(I_{1}+I_{2})$.

Averaging over the Fast Angle**\n\nTo justify averaging, we examine Hamilton's equations of motion for the new variables:\n$$\n\\dot{\\psi} = \\frac{\\partial H'_{\\epsilon}}{\\partial K} = 2\\omega + \\epsilon \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial K} = 2\\omega + \\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{K} = -\\frac{\\partial H'_{\\epsilon}}{\\partial \\psi} = -\\epsilon \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\psi} = \\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{\\phi} = \\frac{\\partial H'_{\\epsilon}}{\\partial J} = \\epsilon \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial J} = \\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{J} = -\\frac{\\partial H'_{\\epsilon}}{\\partial \\phi} = -\\epsilon \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\phi} = \\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)\n$$\nSince $\\omega > 0$ and $\\epsilon \\ll 1$, the angle $\\psi$ evolves on a fast timescale (with frequency $\\approx 2\\omega$), while the variables $J, K, \\phi$ evolve on a slow timescale (of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)$). This separation of timescales justifies applying the method of averaging. The long-term dynamics of the slow variables are governed by an effective Hamiltonian obtained by averaging the full Hamiltonian over one period of the fast angle $\\psi$, treating the slow variables as constants during the integration.\n\nThe averaged Hamiltonian, denoted $H_{\\text{red}}$, is given by:\n$$\nH_{\\text{red}}(J, K, \\phi) = \\langle H'_{\\epsilon} \\rangle_{\\psi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} H'_{\\epsilon}(J, K, \\phi, \\psi)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\psi\n$$\nWe compute the average term by term:\n$$\n\\langle 2\\omega K \\rangle_{\\psi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} 2\\omega K \\, \\mathrm{d}\\psi = 2\\omega K\n$$\n$$\n\\langle \\epsilon a\\,(K^{2}-J^{2})\\cos(\\phi) \\rangle_{\\psi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\epsilon a\\,(K^{2}-J^{2})\\cos(\\phi) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\psi = \\epsilon a\\,(K^{2}-J^{2})\\cos(\\phi)\n$$\nThe terms that depend on $\\psi$ average to zero:\n$$\n\\langle \\epsilon 2bJ\\cos(\\phi+\\psi) \\rangle_{\\psi} = \\frac{\\epsilon 2bJ}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\cos(\\phi+\\psi) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\psi = \\frac{\\epsilon bJ}{\\pi} [\\sin(\\phi+\\psi)]_{0}^{2\\pi} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\langle \\epsilon c\\,\\sqrt{K^{2}-J^{2}}\\cos(\\psi) \\rangle_{\\psi} = \\frac{\\epsilon c \\sqrt{K^{2}-J^{2}}}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\cos(\\psi) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\psi = \\frac{\\epsilon c \\sqrt{K^{2}-J^{2}}}{2\\pi} [\\sin(\\psi)]_{0}^{2\\pi} = 0\n$$\nOnly the terms that do not depend on the fast angle $\\psi$ survive the averaging process. These correspond precisely to the resonant terms of the original perturbation.\n\n**3. Final Reduced Resonant Hamiltonian**\n\nCombining the non-zero terms from the averaging procedure, we obtain the reduced resonant Hamiltonian to order $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)$:\n$$\nH_{\\text{red}}(J, K, \\phi) = 2\\omega K + \\epsilon a\\,(K^{2}-J^{2})\\cos(\\phi)\n$$\nThis effective Hamiltonian describes the slow evolution of the system within the $1:1$ resonance manifold. The dynamics of $(\\phi, J)$ are governed by this one-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian, with $K$ being an integral of motion for the averaged system since $H_{\\text{red}}$ is independent of $\\psi$. This final expression uses only the variables $(J, K, \\phi)$ and the parameters $(\\omega, a, \\epsilon)$, as required. The parameters $b$ and $c$ associated with the non-resonant terms have been correctly eliminated by the averaging procedure.",

            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Phase space: $T^{2} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, with angle variables $\\theta = (\\theta_{1}, \\theta_{2}) \\in T^{2}$ and action variables $I = (I_{1}, I_{2}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\n- Integrable Hamiltonian: $H_{0}(I) = \\omega \\cdot I$.\n- Constant frequencies: $\\omega = (\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\n- Full Hamiltonian: $H(\\theta, I) = \\omega \\cdot I + \\epsilon f(\\theta)$.\n- Perturbation: $f(\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta_{1}) + \\cos(\\theta_{2}) + \\cos(\\theta_{1} - \\theta_{2})$.\n- Property of perturbation: The average of $f(\\theta)$ over $T^2$ is zero.\n- Fourier spectrum of $f(\\theta)$ is supported on the set of wavevectors $k \\in \\{(1,0), (0,1), (1,-1)\\}$ and their negatives.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is a standard exercise in Hamiltonian perturbation theory, specifically the method of averaging. All concepts—Hamiltonians, canonical transformations, Poisson brackets, Fourier series, and small divisors—are fundamental to classical and geometric mechanics. The choice of frequencies $\\omega = (\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ ensures they are rationally independent, which is a key non-resonance condition.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined and provides all necessary information to derive the required quantities. The functions and constants are explicit, leading to a unique solution for the generating function (up to an irrelevant constant) and the small divisor bound.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise mathematical language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be constructed.\n\n**Solution Construction**\n\nThe goal is to find a near-identity canonical transformation that removes the angle-dependent terms from the Hamiltonian $H(\\theta, I) = H_{0}(I) + \\epsilon f(\\theta)$ to first order in $\\epsilon$. We use the Lie series method, where the new Hamiltonian $K$ is related to the old Hamiltonian $H$ by the flow generated by a function $S$. The transformed Hamiltonian is given by $K = e^{\\epsilon \\{., S\\}} H$, where $\\{.,.\\}$ denotes the Poisson bracket.\n\nExpanding the Lie series to first order in $\\epsilon$:\n$$K = H + \\epsilon \\{H, S\\} + \\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{2})$$\nWe substitute $H = H_{0} + \\epsilon f$:\n$$K = H_{0} + \\epsilon f + \\epsilon \\{H_{0} + \\epsilon f, S\\} + \\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{2})$$\n$$K = H_{0} + \\epsilon f + \\epsilon \\{H_{0}, S\\} + \\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{2})$$\nThe Poisson bracket with the integrable part $H_{0}(I) = \\omega \\cdot I$ is:\n$$\\{H_{0}, S\\} = \\frac{\\partial H_{0}}{\\partial \\theta} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial I} - \\frac{\\partial H_{0}}{\\partial I} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\theta} = 0 - \\omega \\cdot \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\theta} = - \\omega \\cdot \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\theta}$$\nHere we assume $S$ is a function of $\\theta$ and $I$, $S=S(\\theta, I)$. Since the frequencies $\\omega$ are constant, we can seek a generating function $S$ that depends only on the angles, $S=S(\\theta)$, to simplify the problem. The transformed Hamiltonian becomes:\n$$K = H_{0} + \\epsilon \\left( f(\\theta) - \\omega \\cdot \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\theta} \\right) + \\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{2})$$\nWe want to choose $S$ such that the new Hamiltonian $K$ is independent of the angles $\\theta$ up to first order. This means the $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)$ term should be a function of actions $I$ only. Let this new term be $K_{1}(I)$. We average the $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)$ term over the torus $T^{2}$:\n$$K_{1}(I) = \\langle f(\\theta) - \\omega \\cdot \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\theta} \\rangle_{T^{2}}$$\nSince $S(\\theta)$ is periodic on $T^{2}$, the average of its gradient is zero, i.e., $\\langle \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\theta} \\rangle = 0$. Thus, $K_{1} = \\langle f \\rangle_{T^{2}}$. The problem states that the perturbation $f(\\theta)$ has zero average, so $\\langle f \\rangle = 0$ and $K_{1}=0$.\n\nThe generating function $S(\\theta)$ is then determined by the condition that the remaining oscillatory part of the $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)$ term vanishes. This leads to the **homological equation**:\n$$\\omega \\cdot \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\theta} = f(\\theta)$$\nTo solve this equation for $S(\\theta)$, we use Fourier series. The given perturbation is:\n$$f(\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta_{1}) + \\cos(\\theta_{2}) + \\cos(\\theta_{1} - \\theta_{2})$$\nWe can solve the homological equation for each term by linearity. For a single harmonic term of the form $\\cos(k \\cdot \\theta)$, the equation is $\\omega \\cdot \\frac{\\partial S_{k}}{\\partial \\theta} = \\cos(k \\cdot \\theta)$. A particular solution is $S_{k}(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sin(k \\cdot \\theta)}{k \\cdot \\omega}$, provided $k \\cdot \\omega \\neq 0$.\n\nFor the given $f(\\theta)$, the solution $S(\\theta)$ is a superposition of solutions for each harmonic:\n$k^{(1)}=(1,0)$, $k^{(2)}=(0,1)$, and $k^{(3)}=(1,-1)$.\n$$S(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sin(k^{(1)} \\cdot \\theta)}{k^{(1)} \\cdot \\omega} + \\frac{\\sin(k^{(2)} \\cdot \\theta)}{k^{(2)} \\cdot \\omega} + \\frac{\\sin(k^{(3)} \\cdot \\theta)}{k^{(3)} \\cdot \\omega}$$\nWith $\\omega = (\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$, we find the denominators (the \"small divisors\"):\n$$k^{(1)} \\cdot \\omega = 1 \\cdot \\sqrt{2} + 0 \\cdot \\sqrt{3} = \\sqrt{2}$$\n$$k^{(2)} \\cdot \\omega = 0 \\cdot \\sqrt{2} + 1 \\cdot \\sqrt{3} = \\sqrt{3}$$\n$$k^{(3)} \\cdot \\omega = 1 \\cdot \\sqrt{2} - 1 \\cdot \\sqrt{3} = \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3}$$\nThe explicit solution for the generating function is:\n$$S(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta_{1})}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{\\sin(\\theta_{2})}{\\sqrt{3}} + \\frac{\\sin(\\theta_{1} - \\theta_{2})}{\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3}}$$\nThis function $S(\\theta)$, chosen to have zero average, generates the transformation that averages the Hamiltonian to first order.\n\nNext, we compute the small divisor bounds. The problem asks for the sharp worst-case reciprocal bound $B(\\omega)$ for the specified harmonics:\n$$B(\\omega) = \\max_{k \\in \\{(1,0),(0,1),(1,-1)\\}} \\frac{1}{|k \\cdot \\omega|}$$\nWe evaluate the reciprocals:\n$$ \\frac{1}{|k^{(1)} \\cdot \\omega|} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{|k^{(2)} \\cdot \\omega|} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{|k^{(3)} \\cdot \\omega|} = \\frac{1}{|\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3}|} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{2}} $$\nWe need to find the maximum of these three values. We compare them:\nSince $\\sqrt{3} > \\sqrt{2}$, we have $0 < \\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{2} < \\sqrt{2} < \\sqrt{3}$.\nTaking reciprocals reverses the inequalities: $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} < \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} < \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{2}}$.\nThus, the maximum value is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{2}}$. We rationalize this expression:\n$$B(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{2}}{(\\sqrt{3})^{2} - (\\sqrt{2})^{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{2}}{3 - 2} = \\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{2}$$\n\nFinally, we explain the role of $B(\\omega)$. The canonical transformation maps the original variables $(\\theta, I)$ to new, averaged variables $(\\theta', I')$. To first order, the transformation for the actions is $I = I' + \\epsilon \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\theta}(\\theta')$. In the new coordinates, the dynamics are simple: $I'(t)$ is constant, and $\\theta'(t)$ evolves with frequency $\\omega$. The true actions $I(t)$ are thus given by:\n$$I(t) = I'(0) + \\epsilon \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\theta}(\\theta'(t)) + \\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{2})$$\nThe difference between the true action $I(t)$ and its first-order averaged value $I'(0)$ is $\\Delta I(t) = I(t) - I'(0) \\approx \\epsilon \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\theta}$. The magnitude of this difference, which represents the error of the averaged solution over times of order one, is bounded by $\\epsilon \\sup_{\\theta} \\|\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\theta}\\|$.\n\nThe gradient of $S(\\theta)$ is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\theta_{1}} = \\frac{\\cos(\\theta_{1})}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{\\cos(\\theta_{1} - \\theta_{2})}{\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3}}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\theta_{2}} = \\frac{\\cos(\\theta_{2})}{\\sqrt{3}} - \\frac{\\cos(\\theta_{1} - \\theta_{2})}{\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3}}$$\nThe amplitudes of the trigonometric terms in these expressions are the reciprocals of the small divisors. The largest amplitude is $\\frac{1}{|\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{3}|} = B(\\omega)$. This term dominates the norm of the gradient $\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\theta}$. For instance, a supremum norm of the gradient will scale with $B(\\omega)$. Therefore, the bound $B(\\omega)$ directly controls the size of the generating function $S$ and its derivatives. A larger $B(\\omega)$ (resulting from a smaller divisor $|k \\cdot \\omega|$) implies a larger error in the first-order approximation of the action variables, as the oscillations of $I(t)$ around the averaged constant value $I'(0)$ have a larger amplitude, on the order of $\\epsilon B(\\omega)$.",
