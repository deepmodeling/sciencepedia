It is well-posed, with a clear objective and all necessary information. The language is objective and formal. The setup is a standard textbook example for demonstrating the method of averaging or canonical perturbation theory. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 2: Method of Solution**\n\nWe seek a near-identity canonical transformation from the original variables $(\\theta, I)$ to new variables $(\\phi, J)$ that simplifies the Hamiltonian. The goal is to make the new Hamiltonian $K$ independent of the new angles $\\phi$ up to order $\\varepsilon$. Such a transformation can be constructed using a generating function. Let us use a type-2 generating function of the form:\n$$\nF_{2}(\\theta, J) = \\theta \\cdot J + \\varepsilon S_{1}(\\theta, J)\n$$\nThis function generates the transformation via the implicit relations:\n$$\nI = \\frac{\\partial F_{2}}{\\partial \\theta} = J + \\varepsilon \\frac{\\partial S_{1}}{\\partial \\theta}(\\theta, J)\n$$\n$$\n\\phi = \\frac{\\partial F_{2}}{\\partial J} = \\theta + \\varepsilon \\frac{\\partial S_{1}}{\\partial J}(\\theta, J)\n$$\nThe new Hamiltonian $K(\\phi, J)$ is obtained by expressing the old Hamiltonian $H_{\\varepsilon}(\\theta, I)$ in terms of the new variables.\n$$\nK(\\phi, J) = H_{\\varepsilon}(\\theta(\\phi, J), I(\\theta, J))\n$$\nWe expand this expression in powers of $\\varepsilon$. From the transformation equations, we have $I = J + O(\\varepsilon)$ and $\\theta = \\phi + O(\\varepsilon)$. We substitute these into $H_\\varepsilon$:\n$$\nH_{\\varepsilon}(\\theta, I) = H_{0}(I) + \\varepsilon H_{1}(\\theta, I)\n$$\nFirst, expand the $H_{0}(I)$ term:\n$$\nH_{0}(I) = H_{0}\\left(J + \\varepsilon \\frac{\\partial S_{1}}{\\partial \\theta}\\right) = H_{0}(J) + \\varepsilon \\nabla_{J}H_{0}(J) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial S_{1}}{\\partial \\theta}(\\theta, J) + O(\\varepsilon^{2})\n$$\nRecognizing that $\\nabla_{J}H_{0}(J) = \\omega(J)$, this becomes:\n$$\nH_{0}(I) = H_{0}(J) + \\varepsilon \\, \\omega(J) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial S_{1}}{\\partial \\theta}(\\theta, J) + O(\\varepsilon^{2})\n$$\nNext, expand the perturbation term $\\varepsilon H_{1}(\\theta, I)$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon H_{1}(\\theta, I) = \\varepsilon H_{1}(\\phi + O(\\varepsilon), J + O(\\varepsilon)) = \\varepsilon H_{1}(\\phi, J) + O(\\varepsilon^{2})\n$$\nCombining these terms, the new Hamiltonian is:\n$$\nK(\\phi, J) = H_{0}(J) + \\varepsilon \\, \\omega(J) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial S_{1}}{\\partial \\theta}(\\theta, J) + \\varepsilon H_{1}(\\phi, J) + O(\\varepsilon^{2})\n$$\nFor consistency to first order, we can replace the variable $\\theta$ in the argument of $S_{1}$ with $\\phi$:\n$$\nK(\\phi, J) = H_{0}(J) + \\varepsilon \\left( H_{1}(\\phi, J) + \\omega(J) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial S_{1}}{\\partial \\phi}(\\phi, J) \\right) + O(\\varepsilon^{2})\n$$\nLet's express the new Hamiltonian as a series $K(\\phi, J) = K_{0}(J) + \\varepsilon K_{1}(\\phi, J) + O(\\varepsilon^2)$.\nBy comparing terms, we find $K_{0}(J) = H_0(J)$.

This means we must choose the generating function $S_{1}$ such that $K_{1}$ is a function of $J$ only. Let's denote this angle-independent function by $\\bar{K}_{1}(J)$. The standard choice is to define $\\bar{K}_{1}(J)$ as the average of $H_{1}(\\phi, J)$ over the torus $\\mathbb{T}^2$:\n$$\n\\bar{K}_{1}(J) = \\langle H_{1} \\rangle_{J} = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{2}} \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^{2}} H_{1}(\\phi, J) \\, d\\phi_{1} d\\phi_{2}\n$$\nThe equation for $S_{1}$ becomes the *homological equation*:\n$$\n\\omega(J) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial S_{1}}{\\partial \\phi}(\\phi, J) = \\bar{K}_{1}(J) - H_{1}(\\phi, J)\n$$\nThe right-hand side, $\\langle H_{1} \\rangle_{J} - H_{1}(\\phi, J)$, is the purely oscillatory part of $-H_{1}$, which has zero average. The non-resonance condition given in the problem, $|\\omega(J) \\cdot k| \\neq 0$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$, ensures that this equation can be solved for $S_{1}$ (by dividing by $\\omega \\cdot k$ in Fourier space), guaranteeing the existence of the desired transformation.\n\n**Step 3: Calculation of the Transformed Hamiltonian**\n\nThe transformed Hamiltonian, to first order, is given by:\n$$\nK(J) = K_{0}(J) + \\varepsilon \\bar{K}_{1}(J) + O(\\varepsilon^{2})\n$$\nWe have $K_{0}(J) = H_{0}(J) = \\frac{1}{2}(J_{1}^{2} + 2J_{2}^{2})$.\nWe now compute $\\bar{K}_{1}(J) = \\langle H_{1} \\rangle_{J}$.

This means that the frequency map $\\omega: \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is not a local diffeomorphism. It maps the entire action plane $(I_{1}, I_{2})$ onto the line $(\\omega_{1}, 0)$ in the frequency space. This degeneracy violates a crucial hypothesis of the standard KAM theorem, which guarantees the persistence of a majority of non-resonant quasiperiodic $2$-tori.\n\n**Task 2: Dynamics of $H_\\varepsilon$ and Persistence of 2-Tori**\n\nThe perturbed Hamiltonian is $H_{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{1}{2} I_{1}^{2} + \\varepsilon \\cos(\\theta_{2})$. We use Hamilton's equations, $\\dot{\\theta}_{i} = \\frac{\\partial H_{\\varepsilon}}{\\partial I_{i}}$ and $\\dot{I}_{i} = -\\frac{\\partial H_{\\varepsilon}}{\\partial \\theta_{i}}$, to analyze the dynamics.\n$$\n\\dot{\\theta}_{1} = \\frac{\\partial H_{\\varepsilon}}{\\partial I_{1}} = I_{1}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{\\theta}_{2} = \\frac{\\partial H_{\\varepsilon}}{\\partial I_{2}} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{I}_{1} = -\\frac{\\partial H_{\\varepsilon}}{\\partial \\theta_{1}} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{I}_{2} = -\\frac{\\partial H_{\\varepsilon}}{\\partial \\theta_{2}} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_{2}}(\\varepsilon \\cos(\\theta_{2})) = \\varepsilon \\sin(\\theta_{2})\n$$\nThe equations $\\dot{I}_1=0$ and $\\dot{\\theta}_2=0$ provide immediate and crucial insights.\nFrom $\\dot{\\theta}_{2} = 0$, it follows that for any trajectory, $\\theta_{2}(t) = \\theta_{2,0}$ (a constant determined by the initial conditions). The frequency associated with the coordinate $\\theta_2$ is identically zero for any motion in the perturbed system.\nA two-frequency quasiperiodic invariant two-torus, as described in the problem, requires both angles to evolve with non-zero frequencies. Since the frequency for $\\theta_2$ is always zero, no such tori can exist in the perturbed system for any $\\varepsilon \\neq 0$. The unperturbed invariant $2$-tori (level sets of $I_1, I_2$) do not persist as invariant $2$-tori carrying two-frequency quasiperiodic motion.\n\n**Task 3: Reduced-Dimensional Invariant Structures**\n\nWe now search for any invariant structures that do persist. An invariant torus must be a compact manifold, which implies that trajectories on it must be bounded. Let's analyze the conditions for bounded motion.\nFrom Hamilton's equations, we have:\n1. $I_{1}(t) = I_{1,0}$ (constant)\n2. $\\theta_{2}(t) = \\theta_{2,0}$ (constant)\n3. $\\theta_{1}(t) = I_{1,0} t + \\theta_{1,0}$\n4. $\\dot{I}_{2} = \\varepsilon \\sin(\\theta_{2,0})$, which implies $I_{2}(t) = I_{2,0} + (\\varepsilon \\sin(\\theta_{2,0}))t$.\n\nFor the motion to be bounded, the action variable $I_2$ must not grow or shrink indefinitely. This requires $\\dot{I}_{2} = 0$.\n$$\n\\varepsilon \\sin(\\theta_{2,0}) = 0\n$$\nFor $\\varepsilon \\neq 0$, this condition is satisfied only if $\\sin(\\theta_{2,0}) = 0$, which means $\\theta_{2,0} = k\\pi$ for some integer $k$. As $\\theta_2$ is an angle, this corresponds to the two distinct submanifolds defined by $\\theta_2=0$ and $\\theta_2=\\pi$.\n\nIf a trajectory starts with an initial condition satisfying $\\theta_2 = k\\pi$, it will remain on this submanifold for all time, as $\\dot{\\theta}_2=0$. Furthermore, on this submanifold, $\\dot{I}_2=0$. Therefore, these are invariant submanifolds.\nLet's consider the dynamics restricted to these invariant sets. For a given initial state $(I_{1,0}, I_{2,0})$ and $\\theta_{2,0}=k\\pi$:\n- $I_{1}(t) = I_{1,0}$\n- $I_{2}(t) = I_{2,0}$\n- $\\theta_{1}(t) = I_{1,0}t + \\theta_{1,0}$\n- $\\theta_{2}(t) = k\\pi$\n\nFor any fixed values of $I_{1,0}$, $I_{2,0}$, and $k$, the set of points\n$$\n\\mathcal{T}_{I_{1,0}, I_{2,0}, k} = \\{ (\\theta_{1}, k\\pi, I_{1,0}, I_{2,0}) \\mid \\theta_{1} \\in [0, 2\\pi) \\}\n$$\nis an invariant manifold. Topologically, this set is a circle ($S^1$), which is a $1$-dimensional torus.\nIf $I_{1,0} \\neq 0$, the motion on this circle is periodic with frequency $I_{1,0}$. Periodic motion is a special case of quasiperiodic motion (with a single frequency). If $I_{1,0} = 0$, the circle is composed entirely of fixed points.\n\nWe have established that invariant $2$-tori do not persist, but families of invariant $1$-tori do persist for $\\varepsilon  0$. These are the only invariant structures that support bounded (quasiperiodic) motion. Therefore, the dimension of the largest invariant quasiperiodic torus that persists is $1$.\n\nFinal Answer: The dimension of the largest invariant quasiperiodic torus that persists for sufficiently small $\\varepsilon  0$ is $1$.",
