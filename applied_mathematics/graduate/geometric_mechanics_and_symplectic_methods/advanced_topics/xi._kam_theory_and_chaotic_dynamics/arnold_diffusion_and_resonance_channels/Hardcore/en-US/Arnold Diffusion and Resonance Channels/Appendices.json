This involves averaging the perturbation $f(\\theta)$ over the fast angle, which corresponds to retaining only the resonant Fourier modes. We express the perturbation $f(\\theta)$ in terms of its Fourier components:\n\n1. The term $a\\cos(\\theta_{2})$ corresponds to a superposition of modes with $m=(0, 1)$ and $m=(0, -1)$.

This implies that its conjugate action, $J_{\\phi}$, is an integral of motion of the averaged system: $\\dot{J}_{\\phi} = -\\frac{\\partial H_{\\text{norm}}}{\\partial \\phi} = 0$.\n\nWe now restrict the dynamics to the specified resonant manifold, which is characterized by $J_{\\phi} = 1$.

The equations of motion combine to give $\\ddot{\\psi} = \\dot{J}_{\\psi} = \\varepsilon a \\sin(\\psi)$, which is the pendulum equation, confirming the problem's assertion.

By taking the real part, we find $\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\frac{\\cos(\\Omega\\tau)}{\\cosh^{2}\\tau} d\\tau = \\frac{\\pi\\Omega}{\\sinh(\\pi\\Omega/2)}$. Also note that $\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\frac{\\sin(\\phi)\\sin(\\Omega\\tau)}{\\cosh^{2}\\tau} d\\tau = 0$ since the integrand is odd.\nApplying this to our integrals, with $\\Omega_{1} = \\omega_{1}-1 = I_{1}-1$ and $\\Omega_{2} = \\omega_{2}-1 = 2I_{2}-1$:\n$$\nL(I, \\theta, t) = 2\\cos\\phi_{1} \\frac{\\pi(I_{1}-1)}{\\sinh(\\frac{\\pi}{2}(I_{1}-1))} + 2\\cos\\phi_{2} \\frac{\\pi(2I_{2}-1)}{\\sinh(\\frac{\\pi}{2}(2I_{2}-1))}.\n$$\nTo evaluate this at the double resonance $I^{\\ast} = (1, 1/2)$, we must take the limit as $I_{1} \\to 1$ and $I_{2} \\to 1/2$. Using the limit $\\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{x}{\\sinh(ax)} = \\frac{1}{a}$:\nFor the first term, with $x=I_{1}-1$ and $a=\\pi/2$, the factor $\\frac{\\pi(I_{1}-1)}{\\sinh(\\frac{\\pi}{2}(I_{1}-1))}$ tends to $\\pi \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\pi/2} = 2$.\nFor the second term, with $x=2I_{2}-1$ and $a=\\pi/2$, the factor $\\frac{\\pi(2I_{2}-1)}{\\sinh(\\frac{\\pi}{2}(2I_{2}-1))}$ also tends to $\\pi \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\pi/2} = 2$.\nThus, at the double resonance, the Melnikov potential is:\n$$\nL(I^{\\ast}, \\theta, t) = 2\\cos\\phi_{1} \\cdot 2 + 2\\cos\\phi_{2} \\cdot 2 = 4\\cos\\phi_{1} + 4\\cos\\phi_{2}.\n$$\nThe action jumps are $\\Delta I = (\\Delta I_{1}, \\Delta I_{2}) = -\\epsilon \\partial_{\\theta} L = -\\epsilon (\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta_{1}}, \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta_{2}})$.\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta_{1}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_{1}}[4\\cos(\\theta_{1}-t) + 4\\cos(\\theta_{2}-t)] = -4\\sin(\\theta_{1}-t) = -4\\sin\\phi_{1}.\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta_{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_{2}}[4\\cos(\\theta_{1}-t) + 4\\cos(\\theta_{2}-t)] = -4\\sin(\\theta_{2}-t) = -4\\sin\\phi_{2}.\n$$\nThe action jumps are therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta I_{1} = -\\epsilon(-4\\sin\\phi_{1}) = 4\\epsilon\\sin\\phi_{1}.\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta I_{2} = -\\epsilon(-4\\sin\\phi_{2}) = 4\\epsilon\\sin\\phi_{2}.\n$$\n\n3) Construction of the two-step diffusion path.\n\nThe total action jump $\\Delta I = (4\\epsilon\\sin\\phi_{1}, 4\\epsilon\\sin\\phi_{2})$ can be decomposed into contributions from each mode of the perturbation $V$. The term $\\cos(\\theta_{1}-t)$ corresponds to the resonance $(k_{1},\\ell_{1})$ and its contribution to the jump is $\\Delta I^{(1)} = (4\\epsilon\\sin\\phi_{1}, 0)$. The term $\\cos(\\theta_{2}-t)$ corresponds to $(k_{2},\\ell_{2})$ and its contribution is $\\Delta I^{(2)} = (0, 4\\epsilon\\sin\\phi_{2})$.\n\nStep 1: First scattering event, jump $\\Delta I_{A}$.\nThe condition is to have maximally increasing drift along the $(k_{1},\\ell_{1})$ channel and no net drift from the $(k_{2},\\ell_{2})$ mode.\nMaximizing the drift from mode 1 means maximizing the vector $\\Delta I^{(1)}=(4\\epsilon\\sin\\phi_{1}, 0)$. This occurs when its magnitude is maximized with a positive sign, so we choose $\\sin\\phi_{1}=1$.\nZero drift from mode 2 means $\\Delta I^{(2)}=(0, 4\\epsilon\\sin\\phi_{2})$ must be the zero vector. This requires $\\sin\\phi_{2}=0$.\nThe total jump in this step is $\\Delta I_{A} = (4\\epsilon\\sin\\phi_{1}, 4\\epsilon\\sin\\phi_{2}) = (4\\epsilon \\cdot 1, 4\\epsilon \\cdot 0) = (4\\epsilon, 0)$.\n\nStep 2: Second scattering event, jump $\\Delta I_{B}$.\nThe condition is to have maximally increasing drift along the $(k_{2},\\ell_{2})$ channel and no net drift from the $(k_{1},\\ell_{1})$ mode.\nMaximizing the drift from mode 2 means maximizing $\\Delta I^{(2)}=(0, 4\\epsilon\\sin\\phi_{2})$. This occurs when its magnitude is maximized, so we choose $\\sin\\phi_{2}=1$.\nZero drift from mode 1 means $\\Delta I^{(1)}=(4\\epsilon\\sin\\phi_{1}, 0)$ must be zero. This requires $\\sin\\phi_{1}=0$.\nThe total jump in this step is $\\Delta I_{B} = (4\\epsilon\\sin\\phi_{1}, 4\\epsilon\\sin\\phi_{2}) = (4\\epsilon \\cdot 0, 4\\epsilon \\cdot 1) = (0, 4\\epsilon)$.\n\nThe total net action displacement after these two concatenated scattering events is the sum of the individual jumps:\n$$\n\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\Delta I_{A} + \\Delta I_{B} = (4\\epsilon, 0) + (0, 4\\epsilon) = (4\\epsilon, 4\\epsilon).\n$$\nThis vector represents the total displacement in the $(I_{1},I_{2})$ plane.",
