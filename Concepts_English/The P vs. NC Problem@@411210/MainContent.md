## Introduction
In our quest for computational power, the ability to divide a task among many processors—[parallel computing](@article_id:138747)—offers the promise of incredible speed. While this approach works wonders for many problems, it raises a fundamental question in [computer science](@article_id:150299): are there limits to this power? Do some efficiently solvable problems possess an "inherently sequential" nature that resists parallel speedup? This is the essence of the P versus NC problem, a deep inquiry into the very structure of computation. This article unpacks this foundational question. In the following chapters, we will first delve into the theoretical framework, defining the classes P and NC, exploring the concept of P-[completeness](@article_id:143338), and examining the mechanisms that make a problem "hard" to parallelize. Following that, we will venture into the real world to see where these "inherently sequential" problems appear, uncovering their surprising connections to physics, economics, and even the frontiers of [quantum computing](@article_id:145253).

Doing it alone would take a lifetime. But what if you could hire an army of librarians to work simultaneously? This is the core promise of [parallel computation](@article_id:273363): more hands make light work. In [computer science](@article_id:150299), we don\'t hire librarians; we use multiple processors. The dream is to solve problems dramatically faster by dividing the labor.\n\nBut how much faster is "dramatically faster"? And how many "librarians" do we need? To bring rigor to this dream, computer scientists defined a class of problems they considered **efficiently parallelizable**. This class is called **NC**, or "Nick\'s Class," named after the computer scientist Nicholas Pippenger.\n\nA problem belongs to **NC** if it can be solved on a parallel computer in **[polylogarithmic time](@article_id:262945)** using a **polynomial number of processors**. Let\'s pause here, because these terms are the heart of the matter.\n\n"Polynomial processors" is the easier part. If your input size is $n$, needing $n^2$ or $n^6$ processors is acceptable. This number grows quickly, but it\'s not astronomically or absurdly large. It\'s a "reasonable" army.\n\n"Polylogarithmic time" is the real magic. Usually, an [algorithm](@article_id:267625)\'s runtime depends on the input size, $n$. A polylogarithmic runtime, like $(\\ln n)^2$ or $(\\ln n)^4$, depends on the *logarithm* of $n$. The logarithm grows excruciatingly slowly. For an input of a billion items ($n = 10^9$), $\\ln n$ is only about 20.7. So, an [algorithm](@article_id:267625) that runs in time proportional to $(\\ln n)^4$ would be astonishingly fast, even for gigantic inputs. It’s as if the time it takes to sort our billion books depends not on the billion books, but on the number of digits in the number "1,000,000,000".\n\nSo, if you devise a parallel [algorithm](@article_id:267625) that runs, say, in $3(\\ln n)^4$ cycles and requires $n^6$ processors, you\'ve placed that problem squarely in **NC**—specifically, in a subclass called **NC'}
