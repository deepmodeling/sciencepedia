## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

We have seen that according to the simple rules of [molecular orbital theory](@article_id:136555), two ground-state helium atoms have no reason to form a stable molecule. The perfect balance of bonding and antibonding electrons results in a bond order of zero, a quantum-mechanical "no thanks." And so, helium earns its reputation as the most aloof of all elements. But is that the end of the story? Far from it! Science is most exciting precisely where our simplest rules break down or reveal unexpected loopholes. The "impossible" helium molecule, it turns out, is a gateway to understanding [exotic matter](@article_id:199166) in the cosmos, developing revolutionary technologies like lasers, and even appreciating the subtle artistry required to perform modern scientific computations.

### A Bond from Nothing: The Magic of Ionization

Let's start with a simple, almost paradoxical trick. What if we take the unstable $\text{He}_2$ system, with its two bonding and two antibonding electrons, and simply... remove one electron? The electron we remove will naturally be the one with the highest energy, which resides in the antibonding $\sigma_{1s}^*$ orbital. The result is the helium dimer cation, $\text{He}_2^+$. What has happened to our [bond order](@article_id:142054)? We're left with two electrons in the bonding orbital and only one in the antibonding one. The new bond order is $\frac{1}{2}(2 - 1) = \frac{1}{2}$ [@problem_id:1355852] [@problem_id:1995003].

Suddenly, a bond exists! It may not be a terribly strong bond—conceptually, half a bond—but it is a bond nonetheless. By taking something away, we have created a connection. This is not just a theorist's daydream. This little ion, $\text{He}_2^+$, has been observed. Where? In places where there is enough energy to knock an electron off a helium atom, such as in specialized laboratory gas discharges or, more majestically, in the atmospheres of stars and nebulae [@problem_id:2004775]. This simple exercise in molecular orbital theory helps astrophysicists model the chemistry of extreme environments across the universe.

Of course, once we have identified a new molecule, we want to give it a proper name—a description of its quantum state. For $\text{He}_2^+$, with its single unpaired electron and specific orbital symmetries, its full descriptive title is ${}^2\Sigma_u^+$. This [term symbol](@article_id:171424) is like a compact identification code, telling a physicist at a glance about the molecule's [total spin](@article_id:152841), its orbital angular momentum, and how its wavefunction behaves under symmetry operations like inversion. It is the language we use to catalog and discuss these exotic species we discover [@problem_id:1994572].

But is a [bond order](@article_id:142054) of $\frac{1}{2}$ always the same? This leads us to a deeper insight. Consider the dihydrogen anion, $\text{H}_2^-$. It also has three electrons and, by the same logic, a [bond order](@article_id:142054) of $\frac{1}{2}$. Yet, experimentally and computationally, the bond in $\text{He}_2^+$ is significantly stronger than in $\text{H}_2^-$. Why? The answer lies not just in the number of electrons, but in the environment they live in. Each helium nucleus has a charge of $+2$, for a total of $+4$ in the dimer. Each hydrogen nucleus has a charge of only $+1$, for a total of $+2$. The electrons in $\text{He}_2^+$ are swimming in a much deeper pool of positive charge. This powerful attraction pulls the bonding orbitals to much lower energies and creates a larger energy gap between the bonding and antibonding levels. So, while both molecules have a net "half-bond," the stabilization gained from that bond is far greater in $\text{He}_2^+$ [@problem_id:2235757]. It's a beautiful lesson: our simple models are powerful, but the real physics is always richer and more quantitative.

### Light from the Unthinkable: Helium Excimers

Let's try another trick. Instead of removing an electron from $\text{He}_2$, what if we add energy to it? Imagine we use a photon to kick an electron from the highest occupied molecular orbital (the antibonding $\sigma_{1s}^*$) to the next available one, the bonding $\sigma_{2s}$ orbital. Our electron configuration transforms from the unbound ground state, $(\sigma_{1s})^2(\sigma_{1s}^*)^2$, to an excited state, $(\sigma_{1s})^2(\sigma_{1s}^*)^1(\sigma_{2s})^1$ [@problem_id:1317914].

Let's check the bond order now. We have two electrons in $\sigma_{1s}$ and one in $\sigma_{2s}$, for a total of three bonding electrons. We have only one antibonding electron left in $\sigma_{1s}^*$. The [bond order](@article_id:142054) becomes $\frac{1}{2}(3 - 1) = 1$. We have created a full, [single bond](@article_id:188067)! This molecule, which is stable only in its excited state, is called an **excimer** (originally from "excited dimer").

This is an astonishing result. Two atoms that repel each other can be forced into a stable molecular bond, but only so long as they remain electronically excited. What happens when the molecule relaxes? The electron from $\sigma_{2s}$ will fall back down to fill the hole in $\sigma_{1s}^*$. The bond order instantly returns to zero, and the bond evaporates. The two helium atoms violently repel each other and fly apart. In the process, the energy of that bond is released in a flash of light of a very specific wavelength.

This principle—a stable excited state and an unstable ground state—is the engine behind **[excimer lasers](@article_id:189730)**. While helium excimers are a perfect textbook illustration, practical [excimer lasers](@article_id:189730) use mixtures of [noble gases](@article_id:141089) (like Argon or Krypton) and halogens (like Fluorine). These lasers produce powerful pulses of ultraviolet light, which are workhorses of modern technology. They are used in [photolithography](@article_id:157602) to etch the microscopic circuits onto the silicon wafers that become our computer chips, and in medicine for procedures like LASIK eye surgery, where their clean, non-thermal cutting ability is paramount. All of this from a simple, counter-intuitive trick of quantum mechanics, beautifully illustrated by the "impossible" helium molecule [@problem_id:1993750].

### Chasing Ghosts in the Machine: The Challenge of Computational Chemistry

In the modern era, our laboratory is often a computer. We can solve the Schrödinger equation for a molecule like $\text{He}_2$ to calculate its properties with incredible precision. But there's a catch. To do this, we must represent the wavelike nature of electrons using a set of mathematical functions, known as a **basis set**. A perfect calculation would require an infinite basis set, which is impossible. We must always use a finite, incomplete one.

Herein lies a subtle and beautiful trap known as the **Basis Set Superposition Error (BSSE)**. Imagine two students taking a difficult test in separate rooms. Their scores reflect their own knowledge. Now, put them in the same room to work on a team problem. Even if they don't collaborate, Student A, struggling with a concept, might glance over and see a formula on Student B's scrap paper. This allows Student A to solve a problem they otherwise couldn't. Their individual ability appears to have improved, but it's an illusion created by "borrowing" from their neighbor.

The same thing happens in a dimer calculation. When we calculate the energy of $\text{He}_2$, the electrons on atom A can "borrow" the basis functions centered on atom B to better describe their own distribution, artificially lowering their energy. This creates a fake attraction that doesn't really exist [@problem_id:1355066]. For a system as delicately bound as the real (van der Waals) helium dimer, this BSSE can be larger than the actual binding energy, leading us to believe a strong bond exists when it's merely a computational phantom.

How do we solve this? With an elegant idea called the **[counterpoise correction](@article_id:178235)**. To measure how much Student A "borrowed" from B, we'd have him take the test again, but this time with Student B's empty desk and scrap papers still in the room. The improvement in his score now is a direct measure of the error. In computational terms, we calculate the energy of a single helium atom, but we place the basis functions of the *other* atom nearby as "ghost orbitals"—they are present mathematically, but have no nucleus or electrons. The amount by which the atom's energy is artificially lowered tells us the magnitude of the BSSE [@problem_id:191341].

This process is a fundamental part of modern computational science. To prove that a calculated result, like the tiny well in the $\text{He}-\text{He}$ [potential energy curve](@article_id:139413), is real and not a BSSE artifact, a scientist must be rigorous. They must apply the [counterpoise correction](@article_id:178235), demonstrate that the result holds up when using progressively larger and better [basis sets](@article_id:163521), and ideally, cross-validate their findings with a completely different computational method that is less susceptible to this error, such as Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT) [@problem_id:2460677]. It's a fascinating look into the philosophy of science in the digital age: our tools are powerful, but we must be ever-vigilant and clever to distinguish physical reality from the ghosts in the machine.

From the heart of a star to the cutting edge of a laser and the core of a supercomputer, the simple helium atom, in its refusal to form a simple molecule, forces us to explore the most interesting and subtle corners of chemistry and physics.
