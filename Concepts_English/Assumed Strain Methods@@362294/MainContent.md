## Introduction
In the world of computational engineering, the Finite Element Method (FEM) stands as a titan, allowing us to simulate everything from skyscraper stability to the mechanics of human tissue. However, this powerful tool has a critical vulnerability: numerical locking. Under certain common conditions, such as modeling thin, bending structures or nearly [incompressible materials](@article_id:175469), standard finite elements can become pathologically stiff, yielding results that are wildly inaccurate and physically meaningless. This article addresses this fundamental challenge by exploring the elegant and powerful family of assumed strain methods, uncovering how these techniques provide a 'smarter' approach to [element formulation](@article_id:171354) that bypasses the root causes of numerical locking.

The journey begins in the "Principles and Mechanisms" chapter, where we will demystify the core idea of replacing problematic strains with carefully constructed 'assumed' ones, exploring foundational techniques like the B-bar and Enhanced Assumed Strain (EAS) methods. Following this, the "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" chapter will showcase these methods in action, revealing how they solve real-world problems across engineering and science, from preventing [shear locking](@article_id:163621) in beams to enabling accurate modeling of [plastic deformation in metals](@article_id:180066).

## Principles and Mechanisms

Imagine you are building a model of the Eiffel Tower using Lego bricks. You build the base, the pillars, and the arches. But when you get to the delicate, curved upper sections, you run into a problem. Your standard, rectangular Lego bricks are too rigid. You can't capture the graceful bend of the real structure; your model becomes a clunky, stiff approximation. You can try using smaller and smaller bricks, but the fundamental problem remains: the bricks themselves are not designed for that kind of deformation. They "lock up."

This is precisely the challenge engineers face when simulating complex structures on a computer. In the Finite Element Method (FEM), we break down a complex object—be it a bridge, an airplane wing, or a biological tissue—into a collection of simple shapes, or **finite elements**. For simple problems, this works beautifully. But when we try to model thin structures that bend, or nearly [incompressible materials](@article_id:175469) (like rubber) that deform at constant volume, these simple digital "bricks" can become pathologically stiff. This phenomenon is called **numerical locking**, and it's not a small error; it can render a simulation completely useless, predicting a structure to be thousands of times stiffer than it actually is.

Why does this happen? The computer element calculates its internal stress based on the positions of its corners. For a thin element asked to bend, a simple [interpolation](@article_id:275553) of its corner movements can create a large amount of spurious **shear strain**—a kind of internal grinding that real, thin plates avoid by bending gracefully. For a nearly incompressible element asked to deform, the same simple [interpolation](@article_id:275553) might force a change in volume, which the material resists with immense force. In both cases, the element locks because its limited "vocabulary" of deformation is inconsistent with the physics it's trying to represent [@problem_id:2595542]. Making the elements smaller ([mesh refinement](@article_id:168071)) doesn't always solve the problem, because the flaw is in the very nature of the element itself. To build a better model, we need smarter bricks. This is where the beautiful idea of **assumed strain methods** comes in.

### The Art of the "Consistent Lie"

The core idea behind assumed strain methods is both simple and profound: if the strain calculated directly from the element's distorted shape is causing problems, then let's not use it. Instead, let's *assume* a simpler, better-behaved strain field inside the element. We are, in a sense, telling the element a "lie" about its internal state of deformation—but it's a carefully constructed lie, a consistent lie that ultimately tells a deeper truth.

Let's see how this works in the simplest possible case: a straight, uniform bar being pulled at its ends. Using a standard finite element, we can model this with a single two-node element. The displacement varies linearly from one end to the other, which results in a perfectly constant strain throughout the element. The standard method gets this exactly right. Now, let's try an "assumed stress" approach, which is a close cousin to assumed strain. We start with a mixed principle (the Hellinger-Reissner principle) and *assume* the stress inside the element is just a single, constant value. We then use the principles of mechanics to find what this constant stress must be to be consistent with the pulling at the ends. When we solve the equations, we find that this procedure gives us the *exact* same, correct stiffness for the bar [@problem_id:2639882]. This is a crucial first check. It tells us that this philosophy of assuming internal fields isn't just a random hack; it's rooted in the same fundamental [variational principles](@article_id:197534) of mechanics as the standard method, and it can reproduce correct results.

### The B-bar Method: Curing the Incompressible Lock-up

Now, let's tackle a real locking problem: modeling a block of rubber. Rubber is nearly incompressible; you can change its shape easily, but it's incredibly hard to change its volume. Any deformation can be mathematically split into two parts: a **deviatoric** part (change in shape) and a **volumetric** part (change in volume). Volumetric locking happens because a simple element's geometry might force it to calculate non-zero volume changes, even when it's just trying to shear or bend. The simulated material, being nearly incompressible, responds with enormous resistance, and the element locks.

The famous **B-bar ($\overline{B}$) method** offers an elegant solution [@problem_id:2542532]. It says: let's keep the complex, shape-changing (deviatoric) strain that our element calculates from its corners. But for the problematic, volume-changing (volumetric) strain, let's throw out the complicated local variations. Instead, we'll calculate the *average* volume change over the entire element and assume that this single, constant value applies everywhere inside.

It's like telling the digital brick: "I see you think you're being squeezed in this corner and stretched in that one. Forget it. On average, your volume hasn't changed, so just relax." This simple act of averaging, or projecting the [volumetric strain](@article_id:266758) onto a constant, provides just enough flexibility for the element to deform freely without locking. It's a targeted strike, fixing only the part of the strain that causes the problem. And once again, this practical "trick" isn't an arbitrary fix. It can be rigorously shown to be equivalent to a more complex mixed [variational formulation](@article_id:165539) (a specific form of the Hu-Washizu principle) where an independent pressure field is introduced to manage the [incompressibility](@article_id:274420) constraint [@problem_id:2542532]. This beautiful connection between a simple, implementable idea and a deep theoretical principle is a hallmark of great engineering science.

### Enhanced Assumed Strains (EAS): The General Principle

The $\overline{B}$ method is a specialized tool for [volumetric locking](@article_id:172112). Can we generalize this idea to tackle other forms of locking, like [shear locking](@article_id:163621) in plates and shells? The answer is yes, and the framework is known as the **Enhanced Assumed Strain (EAS) method**.

The philosophy is to augment, or "enhance," the strain field. The total strain inside the element is no longer just the **compatible strain** ($\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{\mathrm{comp}}$) derived from the movement of its corners. Instead, we add an extra piece, an **enhanced strain** ($\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{\mathrm{enh}}$), that lives entirely inside the element [@problem_id:2601669].

$$ \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{\mathrm{total}} = \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{\mathrm{comp}} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{\mathrm{enh}} $$

This enhanced strain acts as a kind of internal "slack," giving the element extra deformation modes that aren't tied to the global movement of its nodes. This extra flexibility allows the element to satisfy the physical constraints (like zero shear in [pure bending](@article_id:202475)) locally, without transmitting spurious stiffness to the overall structure. For instance, in a quadrilateral element trying to model a nearly [incompressible material](@article_id:159247), we can add an extra [volumetric strain](@article_id:266758) mode that allows the [incompressibility](@article_id:274420) constraint to be met without locking the element's primary deformation [@problem_id:2555193].

But how do we add this slack without tearing the model apart? The key is that the enhanced strain field is designed to be zero on the boundaries of the element. It's often defined using a so-called "[bubble function](@article_id:178545)," which has a value of zero on the element's edges and "bubbles up" in the interior [@problem_id:2553920]. This ensures that while the element has extra flexibility inside, it still connects perfectly and continuously with its neighbors. The enhancement is a purely internal affair.

Of course, this extra freedom can't be a free-for-all. It must be governed by a physical principle. The consistency condition that ties the whole theory together is a statement of orthogonality. Derived from the [variational principles](@article_id:197534) of mechanics, the condition states that the work done by the final stress field on the enhanced strain modes must be zero [@problem_id:2601669] [@problem_id:2566169].

$$ \int_{\Omega_{e}} \boldsymbol{\sigma} : \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{\mathrm{enh}} \, \mathrm{d}\Omega = 0 $$

This beautiful condition ensures that the enhanced modes are only there to alleviate constraints and cannot spuriously generate or absorb energy. They are "ghost" deformations that serve their purpose and then disappear from the [energy balance](@article_id:150337). Furthermore, to ensure the method is consistent, the formulation must still be able to correctly represent the simplest cases, like a state of constant strain. This is guaranteed by passing a condition known as the **patch test**, which imposes further mathematical constraints on the choice of the enhanced strain fields [@problem_id:2566169].

### A Family of Clever Solutions

The assumed strain method is not the only way to build smarter bricks. It belongs to a family of advanced formulations, each with a different philosophy but a shared goal [@problem_id:2568536] [@problem_id:2558522].

-   **Reduced Integration:** This method is like squinting. Instead of checking for strain everywhere in the element, you only check it at a few select points. This makes the element less sensitive to the spurious strains that cause locking. It's computationally cheap and effective but can sometimes be *too* flexible, leading to non-physical "hourglass" motions that need to be controlled.

-   **Incompatible Modes:** This approach adds extra, "incompatible" displacement modes inside the element, rather than adding strain directly. These modes are also designed to be zero on the boundary, providing internal flexibility much like the EAS method.

-   **Hybrid Stress Methods:** This is perhaps the most different philosophy. Instead of starting with displacements and deriving strains, this method starts by assuming an independent **stress field** inside the element. It then uses a different [variational principle](@article_id:144724) (the Hellinger-Reissner principle) to enforce equilibrium and compatibility in a weak, integral sense. This approach also very effectively decouples the variables that cause locking but comes with its own set of stability requirements, known as the Ladyzhenskaya–Babuška–Brezzi (LBB) conditions, that must be carefully satisfied [@problem_id:2566123].

What's truly wonderful is that all these sophisticated techniques—assumed strains, assumed stresses, and others—can be seen through a single, unifying lens. They are all ingenious ways to **reparameterize the constitutive constraint** [@problem_id:2555193]. The standard method locks because it insists on a rigid, sequential chain: nodal displacements dictate the compatible strain, which in turn dictates the stress. Assumed strain and stress methods break this rigid chain. They introduce new, independent variables—the assumed strains or stresses—and rewrite the laws of physics in a more flexible, but equally valid, variational form. They create new pathways for the simulation to express the underlying physics, bypassing the roadblocks that cause numerical locking and allowing our digital models to behave with the same grace and subtlety as the real world.
