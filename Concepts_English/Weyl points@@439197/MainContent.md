## Introduction
In the quantum realm of solid-state physics, our understanding of materials has long been defined by the separation between [energy bands](@article_id:146082)—the band gap—which dictates whether a material is an insulator or a conductor. However, this picture is incomplete. What happens at the rare, special points where these bands touch? The answer lies in the discovery of topological materials, and at their heart is one of the most exotic quasiparticles predicted by theory: the Weyl point. These points are not merely incidental crossings but are robust, topologically protected entities that fundamentally alter a material's electronic properties. This article delves into the fascinating world of Weyl points, addressing the gap between simple band theory and the complex topological phenomena that are revolutionizing materials science. In the following chapters, we will first explore the fundamental "Principles and Mechanisms" that govern Weyl points, from their nature as momentum-space monopoles to the rules of their creation and annihilation. Subsequently, we will examine their tangible impact in "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections," showcasing their discovery in real materials and their promise for next-generation electronics, photonics, and beyond.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Imagine the vast, intricate landscape of all possible energies an electron can have inside a crystal. This isn't a simple, flat terrain; it's a complex world of hills and valleys, known as **[energy bands](@article_id:146082)**, defined over a strange, loopy space called **momentum space**. For a long time, we were mostly concerned with the peaks (conduction bands) and valleys (valence bands) and the gaps between them, which determine whether a material is a conductor or an insulator. But what happens at the points where these landscapes touch? What marvels lie at the intersection of these worlds? This is where our story begins, at the very heart of topological materials, with the discovery of the Weyl point.

### A Monopole in Momentum Space

In most materials, if a conduction band and a valence band were to touch, they would typically open up a gap, repelling each other like two magnets with the same pole. But under special circumstances, they can be forced to touch at an isolated point. The simplest, most robust way for this to happen in three dimensions is at a **Weyl point**. It is a linear, two-fold degenerate crossing point—a "conical" intersection where two [energy bands](@article_id:146082) meet at a single vertex.

But a Weyl point is far more than a simple geometric feature. It is a topologically stable object, meaning you can't get rid of it by just gently deforming the crystal's parameters. Its stability comes from a hidden property, a kind of charge it carries. This isn't electric charge, but a [topological charge](@article_id:141828) known as **chirality**.

To understand this, we need to talk about the **Berry curvature**, $\boldsymbol{\Omega}(\mathbf{k})$. You can think of it as an invisible field permeating the momentum space, much like a magnetic field in real space. It describes how the quantum mechanical wavefunction of an electron twists and turns as its momentum, $\mathbf{k}$, changes. A Weyl point acts as a source or a sink for this Berry curvature—a **monopole** in momentum space. If you draw a tiny sphere around a Weyl point and measure the total "flux" of Berry curvature flowing out of it, you will find it is perfectly quantized to be an integer! This integer, $\chi = \pm 1$, is the chirality of the Weyl point. A node with $\chi = +1$ is a source (a "north pole"), while a node with $\chi = -1$ is a sink (a "south pole"). Just as a [magnetic monopole](@article_id:148635) in electromagnetism would be a fundamental, indestructible source of magnetic field, a Weyl point is a fundamental, topologically protected source of Berry curvature [@problem_id:2870328].

### The Law of the Lattice: No Monopole is an Island

This monopole analogy leads to a profound question: can we have just one Weyl point in a crystal? After all, physicists have been searching for a single magnetic monopole in the universe for decades without success. It turns out that inside a crystal, the answer is an unambiguous *no*. This fundamental rule is known as the **Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem**. It states that the sum of the chiralities of all Weyl nodes in the entire momentum space must be exactly zero.

Why is this so? The reason is beautiful and lies in the topology of the crystal's momentum space itself. Because a crystal is a periodic lattice of atoms, its [momentum space](@article_id:148442) (the Brillouin zone) loops back on itself. It is a [compact space](@article_id:149306) without any boundary, like the surface of a donut. Now, imagine our Berry curvature is a fluid. A monopole with positive chirality is a source, continuously pumping fluid into the space. A monopole with negative [chirality](@article_id:143611) is a sink, continuously draining it. If you had only one source on the surface of a donut, where would all the fluid go? With no edge to flow off of, it would have to pile up forever. This is physically untenable. The only way to have a stable flow is if every source is perfectly balanced by a sink. The total flux across the entire closed space must be zero. Thus, the sum of all chiralities must vanish: $\sum_i \chi_i = 0$ [@problem_id:2870291] [@problem_id:3024297].

There's an even deeper physical reason. A single, unbalanced Weyl node would lead to a bizarre phenomenon called the **[chiral anomaly](@article_id:141583)**, where applying parallel [electric and magnetic fields](@article_id:260853) would appear to create or destroy electric charge from the vacuum, violating one of physics' most sacred conservation laws. Nature avoids this absurdity by ensuring that the anomalous charge creation at a $\chi=+1$ node is perfectly canceled by charge destruction at a $\chi=-1$ node somewhere else in the crystal [@problem_id:3024297].

The inescapable conclusion is that Weyl points must always come in pairs (or larger even-numbered groups) of opposite [chirality](@article_id:143611). This "doubling" is a fundamental law of matter on a lattice. Symmetry can impose even stricter rules. For example, in a material with time-reversal symmetry (where the laws of physics are the same if time runs backward), a Weyl node at momentum $\mathbf{k}$ implies the existence of another node with the *same* [chirality](@article_id:143611) at $-\mathbf{k}$. To satisfy the zero-sum rule, there must then be at least two *more* nodes of the opposite chirality, meaning the minimum number of Weyl points in such a material is four [@problem_id:1135081].

### Symmetry as a Master Architect: From Dirac to Weyl

If Weyl points are so fundamental, where do we find them? A powerful strategy is to start with a more symmetric, but less exotic, cousin: the **Dirac point**. A Dirac point is a four-fold degenerate crossing, which can be thought of as a pair of Weyl points with opposite [chirality](@article_id:143611) ($\chi=+1$ and $\chi=-1$) sitting exactly on top of each other in both momentum and energy. Since their charges cancel locally, the net chirality is zero, and they are not individually robust monopoles [@problem_id:2870328].

What holds these opposite charges together in a tight embrace? The answer is **symmetry**. This delicate state of affairs is protected by the combined presence of both **[time-reversal symmetry](@article_id:137600) (TRS)** and **inversion symmetry (IS)** (where the crystal looks the same when viewed upside down). As long as the crystal respects both of these symmetries, the Dirac point is stable [@problem_id:1827867].

But this gives us a wonderful recipe for creation! If we break one of these protecting symmetries, the embrace is broken, and the constituent Weyl points are free to separate. They emerge from the Dirac point like celestial twins, revealing their individual topological nature.

*   If we **break inversion symmetry** (by using a crystal that lacks a center of symmetry), the two Weyl points split apart in **energy**, remaining at the same momentum point but now at different energy levels.

*   If we **break time-reversal symmetry** (most easily done by applying a magnetic field), the two Weyl points split apart in **momentum**, moving to different locations $\mathbf{k}_+$ and $\mathbf{k}_-$ in the Brillouin zone while remaining at the same energy.

A simple model Hamiltonian can make this beautifully clear. Perturbing a Dirac point with a term like $b_0 \tau_z$ breaks inversion symmetry and shifts the two Weyl nodes to energies $E=\pm b_0$. In contrast, a magnetic-field-like term such as $-v\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\mathbf{b}$ breaks [time-reversal symmetry](@article_id:137600) and pushes the nodes to opposite momenta $\mathbf{k}=\pm\mathbf{b}$ [@problem_id:2870338]. This symmetry-based approach provides a powerful design principle for discovering and engineering Weyl [semimetals](@article_id:151783).

### Creation and Annihilation: The Drama of Phase Transitions

The story gets even more dramatic. We don't even need to start with a Dirac point. We can conjure a pair of Weyl points seemingly out of thin air from a simple, "trivial" insulator! Imagine a material that is a normal insulator with a band gap, described by a mass parameter $m$. Now, let's apply a magnetic field, which introduces an energy scale $b$ that tries to close this gap.

For a weak field, where $|b|  |m|$, the material remains a boring insulator. Nothing happens. But as we crank up the field, we reach a critical point where $|b| = |m|$. At this precise moment, the band gap closes. If we increase the field just an infinitesimal amount further, so that $|b| > |m|$, the gap re-opens, but not before giving birth to a pair of Weyl points! They emerge from a single point in momentum space and move away from each other as the field gets stronger. The separation between them grows as $\Delta k \propto \sqrt{b^2 - m^2}$. This is a **[topological phase transition](@article_id:136720)**—a fundamental change in the quantum nature of the material's ground state, driven by an external field [@problem_id:2870337].

This process is entirely reversible. If we have a Weyl semimetal, we can tune a parameter—like pressure, strain, or a different field—to push the nodes of opposite [chirality](@article_id:143611) towards each other. In a model where a mass parameter $M$ controls the node separation, we might find two nodes located at $k_z = \pm \sqrt{M/t}$. As we decrease $M$ towards zero, the nodes race towards each other. At the critical point $M_c=0$, they meet and **annihilate**, releasing their topological charge in a flash of energy and leaving behind a trivial gapped insulator. The monopoles are gone [@problem_id:206893]. This reveals that the Weyl semimetal is a distinct, robust phase of matter, separated from trivial phases by these beautiful and dramatic topological transitions.

### The Smoking Gun: Surface Fermi Arcs

So, we have these exotic monopoles hiding in the bulk of a crystal. Is this just a theorist's fantasy, or can we see them? The answer is a resounding yes, thanks to one of the most elegant concepts in modern physics: the **[bulk-boundary correspondence](@article_id:137153)**. This principle states that the non-[trivial topology](@article_id:153515) of the bulk *must* manifest as a strange, guaranteed state on its boundary, i.e., its surface.

For a Weyl semimetal, this surface state is one of the most bizarre and beautiful objects in [solid-state physics](@article_id:141767): the **Fermi arc**. A normal metal has a Fermi surface, which consists of closed loops or pockets of electron states. These loops define all the possible momenta that electrons can have at the Fermi energy. A Fermi arc, on the other hand, is an *open* contour. It's a line of allowed electron states on the surface that abruptly starts at the projection of a bulk Weyl node of one chirality (say, $\chi = -1$) and terminates at the projection of a bulk Weyl node of the opposite chirality ($\chi = +1$) [@problem_id:3024294].

It’s as if there's a highway on the surface that only runs between the city of "North Pole" and the city of "South Pole" and simply doesn't exist anywhere else. An electron can enter the surface from the bulk via one node, travel along this one-dimensional arc, and then disappear back into the bulk at the other node. The length of this arc in momentum space is directly related to the separation of the Weyl points in the bulk, a distance we can calculate from the material's parameters [@problem_id:1283743]. These strange, disconnected arcs have been directly observed in experiments using [photoemission spectroscopy](@article_id:139053), providing a stunning snapshot of the hidden topological world within and confirming that Weyl points are not just a mathematical curiosity, but a tangible reality of our quantum universe.
