## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Now that we have rigorously defined what a "basis" is, we can finally have some fun with it. The true power and beauty of this concept don't lie in the axioms themselves, but in their extraordinary versatility. A basis is like a set of primitive building blocks—a bit like having an infinite supply of LEGO bricks of specific shapes. By choosing our bricks wisely, we can construct an astonishing variety of mathematical "worlds," each with its own unique geometry and rules of "closeness." The journey we are about to take will show that this simple idea is a golden thread connecting the familiar geometry of our own world to the abstract realms of modern algebra and beyond.

### Sculpting Familiar Space

Let's begin in a place we all know and love: the flat two-dimensional plane, $\mathbb{R}^2$. As we’ve seen, the standard way to define "open sets" here is to use either open rectangles or open disks as our basis elements. It's a wonderful first lesson in topology that it doesn't matter which you choose; any open set you can build by gluing together disks, you can also build by gluing together tiny rectangles, and vice-versa. They generate the very same topology, our familiar Euclidean world.

But must our building blocks be so... roundish? What if we chose a different set of primitives? Imagine our basis for $\mathbb{R}^2$ consisted only of infinite vertical strips, sets of the form $(a,b) \times \mathbb{R}$. This collection certainly covers the plane, and the intersection of two vertical strips is just another, thinner vertical strip. So, it satisfies the axioms and forms a legitimate basis. But what kind of world does it create? In this topology, you can move up or down as far as you like and still be in the same "basic neighborhood." The only way to move into a truly different open set is to take a step sideways. This topology can't distinguish between points that share the same x-coordinate! It's as if the entire vertical dimension has been "squashed" from the perspective of the topology. We have, in fact, constructed the [product topology](@article_id:154292) of the standard line and a line with the *indiscrete* topology, where the only open sets are the [empty set](@article_id:261452) and the line itself [@problem_id:1634009].

This is a simple but profound illustration of a key idea: the nature of your basis elements dictates the fundamental geometric character of your space. Consider another strange example on the real line, $\mathbb{R}$. Instead of standard [open intervals](@article_id:157083) $(a,b)$, what if we use half-[open intervals](@article_id:157083) of the form $[a,b)$ as our basis? This collection, known as the basis for the *Sorgenfrey line*, creates a topology where a point is "close" to its neighbors on the right, but strangely "distant" from its neighbors on the left. The set $[0,1)$, for instance, is a basic open set in this world, something unthinkable in the standard topology [@problem_id:1625104]. This seemingly small tweak to the building blocks creates a space with bizarre and fascinating properties that serves as a crucial testbed for topological conjectures.

Of course, not just any collection of shapes will do. If we tried to use a combination of infinite vertical *and* horizontal strips as a basis, we would fail. The intersection of a vertical strip and a horizontal strip is a bounded rectangle. But if our basis *only* contains infinite strips, there's no smaller basis element we can fit inside this rectangle, thus violating the second axiom. This failure is just as instructive as success; it teaches us that the basis elements must be able to "play nicely" with each other at all scales [@problem_id:1625109].

### Building New Worlds from Old

One of the most powerful features of the basis concept is that it allows us to construct topologies on new spaces from ones we already understand. Two of the most important methods are constructing *[product spaces](@article_id:151199)* and *subspaces*.

If you have a basis for a space $X$ and a basis for a space $Y$, a natural basis for the product space $X \times Y$ is simply the collection of all "product sets" $U \times V$, where $U$ is a basis element from $X$ and $V$ is a basis element from $Y$. This is exactly what we do when we define the [standard topology](@article_id:151758) on the plane $\mathbb{R}^2 \cong \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ using rectangles, which are just products of intervals. But we can apply this to more exotic objects. What is the basis for the surface of an infinite cylinder? We can think of a cylinder as the product of a circle, $S^1$, and a line, $\mathbb{R}$. The basis elements for a circle are open arcs, and for a line, they are open intervals. Therefore, the basis for the cylinder is simply the collection of all "patches" formed by taking the product of an open arc and an open interval [@problem_id:1625120]. Similarly, the basis for the plane $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}$ (Sorgenfrey line times the standard line) consists of "half-open rectangles" of the form $[a,b) \times (c,d)$ [@problem_id:1581347].

The other key method is inheriting a topology. Suppose you have a large space $X$ with a topology, and you want to consider a subset $Y \subseteq X$ as a [topological space](@article_id:148671) in its own right. How do you do it? The answer is beautifully simple: the basis for $Y$ is just the collection of all intersections of the basis elements of $X$ with $Y$. This is called the *[subspace topology](@article_id:146665)*.

A truly remarkable example is the set of rational numbers, $\mathbb{Q}$, as a subspace of the real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$. The basis for $\mathbb{R}$ is the set of [open intervals](@article_id:157083) $(a,b)$. So, a basis for $\mathbb{Q}$ is the set of all intervals $(a,b)$ intersected with $\mathbb{Q}$. But here's where it gets interesting. Because the rational numbers are "dense" in the real line (in any interval, you can find a rational), it turns out we could have just started with intervals $(a,b)$ where $a$ and $b$ are themselves *rational*. This smaller collection of building blocks generates the exact same topology! Even more surprisingly, because the *irrational* numbers are also dense, we could have used intervals whose endpoints are both *irrational*, and we would *still* get the same topology on $\mathbb{Q}$ [@problem_id:1676229]. The underlying structure of the space is independent of these superficial choices, a testament to the robustness of the topological description.

### Topology Meets Algebra

Perhaps the most breathtaking applications of the basis concept arise when we venture into the world of abstract algebra. Here, sets often come equipped with operations, like groups or rings of matrices. It turns out that the language of topology provides a powerful new lens through which to view these algebraic structures.

Consider an arbitrary group $G$. Can we define a "natural" topology on it? Let's try to build a basis. For any subgroup $H$ of $G$, we can form its left [cosets](@article_id:146651), $gH$. What if we declare that our collection of building blocks, $\mathcal{B}$, is the set of *all* left [cosets](@article_id:146651) of *all* subgroups of $G$? Let's check the axioms. The collection certainly covers $G$ (for any $g \in G$, the coset $g\{e\} = \{g\}$ contains it). What about the intersection of two basis elements, say $g_1H_1$ and $g_2H_2$? If a point $x$ lies in their intersection, the basis property requires that we find another basis element $B_3$ containing $x$ that fits inside this intersection. Group theory shows that the intersection of the two subgroups, $H_1 \cap H_2$, is also a subgroup. We can then form the left [coset](@article_id:149157) $B_3 = x(H_1 \cap H_2)$, which is an element of our basis collection $\mathcal{B}$. This new set $B_3$ contains $x$ and is contained within the original intersection, satisfying the basis axiom. Thus, this collection forms a [basis for a topology](@article_id:156307) on *any group whatsoever* [@problem_id:1555281]. This is a stunning result, a perfect marriage of algebraic structure and topological rules.

Let's turn to linear algebra. The set of all $n \times n$ matrices is just a version of the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$, so we know how to define a topology on it. Now, consider the *[special linear group](@article_id:139044)*, $SL(n, \mathbb{R})$, which is the set of all $n \times n$ matrices with determinant equal to 1. This is a group, but it's also a graceful, curved surface living inside the larger space of all matrices. As a subspace, its topology is inherited. A basis element is simply an open ball of matrices intersected with $SL(n, \mathbb{R})$. That is, it's the set of all matrices *with determinant 1* that are very close to some given matrix $A$ in $SL(n, \mathbb{R})$ [@problem_id:1625121]. This allows us to apply the tools of calculus and geometry to the study of this fundamentally algebraic object, opening the door to the rich field of Lie groups. It's crucial to pick the right basis; a seemingly natural choice, like the collection of matrices whose determinant is close to 1, doesn't work. Another plausible-sounding collection, the set of matrices with determinant greater than some positive constant $c$, fails the very first axiom: it doesn't cover the space, as it misses all the matrices with determinant zero [@problem_id:1547813].

Finally, we arrive at one of the deepest connections of all: algebraic geometry. Here, we study the solution sets of polynomial equations, which are called *algebraic varieties*. For example, in $\mathbb{R}^3$, the equation $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0$ defines a cone. Let's try to define a topology on $\mathbb{R}^n$ where these algebraic varieties are the fundamental "closed" sets. This means the *open* sets must be their complements. Does the collection of all complements of algebraic varieties form a [basis for a topology](@article_id:156307)? The covering property is easy to check. The intersection property is the amazing part. The intersection of two such open sets is the complement of the union of two varieties. And a beautiful algebraic fact states that the union of two algebraic varieties is itself an algebraic variety! This means the intersection of two of our basis elements is once again a basis element. And so, the collection works perfectly [@problem_id:1625163]. This is the famous *Zariski topology*, a cornerstone of modern mathematics where the very notion of "openness" is defined not by distance, but by the algebraic properties of polynomials.

From the plane we stand on to the abstract structures of group theory and algebraic geometry, the concept of a [basis for a topology](@article_id:156307) provides a unified and powerful language. It is a testament to the way mathematics builds elegant and far-reaching theories from the simplest of foundational rules. By choosing our building blocks, we choose our world.
