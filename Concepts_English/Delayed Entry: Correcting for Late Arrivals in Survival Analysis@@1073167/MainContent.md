## Introduction
How do we accurately measure time-to-event outcomes when our observation doesn't start at the very beginning? In many real-world studies, from medicine to social sciences, we enroll subjects who are already partway through their journey—a phenomenon known as **delayed entry** or **left truncation**. This common situation poses a significant challenge: failing to account for these "late arrivals" can systematically distort our findings, leading to dangerously optimistic conclusions about survival or risk. This error, known as immortal time bias, arises from incorrectly treating the unobserved survival period as event-free time. This article demystifies the problem of delayed entry and provides a clear guide to its solution.

The first section, **"Principles and Mechanisms,"** will dissect the core problem, distinguishing left truncation from left censoring, explaining how immortal time bias creates a "survivor's curse," and detailing the correct statistical approach of dynamically adjusting the risk set. Following this, the section on **"Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections"** will explore the profound impact of this concept across various fields. We will see how properly handling delayed entry is essential for everything from estimating [genetic disease](@entry_id:273195) risk to conducting fair clinical comparisons and even choosing the most natural time scale for epidemiological research.

## Principles and Mechanisms

### The Problem of the Late Arrival

Imagine you are tasked with studying the lifespan of a new type of lightbulb. You start a grand experiment, screwing in a hundred new bulbs and starting your stopwatch. But to get more data, your boss tells you to include bulbs from a neighboring lab that have already been running for some time. You dutifully record when these "late arrivals" burn out. Now, a crucial question arises: how do you analyze this combined data? Can you simply treat a bulb that has already been shining for 500 hours the same as one you just turned on?

Of course not. The old bulb has already proven it can last at least 500 hours. The new bulb has proven nothing. Lumping them together would create a distorted picture, making the bulbs seem more robust than they are. This simple thought experiment captures the essence of a fundamental challenge in medical and social sciences: **delayed entry**, also known as **left truncation**.

In science, we are often trying to measure the time from a starting point—like a disease diagnosis, the start of a therapy, or even birth—to a specific event, like recovery, disease progression, or death. In an ideal world, we would follow everyone from their exact starting point. But the world is messy. Our studies often begin long after people’s "clocks" have started ticking. Consider a patient registry for a chronic disease set up in 2015. It will naturally enroll patients who were diagnosed in 2014, 2010, or even earlier, as long as they are still alive to sign the consent form. [@problem_id:4985853] These are our late arrivals. The critical fact is that we *only* see the people who survived long enough to enter our study. Anyone who was diagnosed and unfortunately experienced the event *before* they could enroll is a ghost in our data; we never know they existed. [@problem_id:4962211]

It is vital to distinguish this from a different kind of incomplete information called **left censoring**. With left censoring, we know a person exists and that their event happened *before* a certain time, but we don't know the exact date. For instance, at the start of a study, we might identify a patient who already has the disease; we know their disease onset was sometime in the past, but the records are lost. [@problem_id:4547024] This is like finding a note on a chair that says, "Someone was here before 9 AM." We have information, however incomplete. Left truncation is different. It is an empty chair. We have no note, no record, no knowledge of the person who might have had the event and disappeared before we even started looking. They are truncated from our sample of reality.

### The Illusion of Immortality and the Survivor's Curse

What happens if we fail to appreciate this distinction? What if we treat the late arrivals as if they were with us from the very beginning? The consequences are not just minor statistical inaccuracies; they lead to a profound and misleading illusion. This mistake is so common and so dangerous it has its own name: **immortal time bias**. [@problem_id:5228327]

Let's say a patient is diagnosed at time $t=0$ and enrolls in our study at a later entry time, $E_i$. The period from $0$ to $E_i$ is "immortal" time for this patient *from the perspective of our study*. To be included in our data, they *had* to survive this interval. Death was not an option for them during this period, or we would never have met them.

If we naively count this immortal, event-free time as part of our analysis—crediting it to a treatment they may have started at time $E_i$, for example—we create a powerful bias. Our study cohort is artificially enriched with survivors. It's a "survivor's curse": by the very nature of our sampling, we have filtered out the frail and kept the strong. This is a form of **selection bias**, or more specifically, **[length-biased sampling](@entry_id:264779)**, because those with longer survival times are more likely to be around to be sampled. [@problem_id:4985853] [@problem_id:4638772]

The effect can be dramatic. Imagine a hypothetical disease where, from diagnosis, the survival probability follows an exponential decay with a half-life of one year. The true one-year survival, $S(1)$, is exactly 0.5. Now, suppose we assemble our study subjects from a prevalent cohort—a snapshot of all patients alive on a given day—and naively analyze their survival since diagnosis, ignoring that they are all "late arrivals." Because our sample is over-represented by long-term survivors, our analysis will be wildly optimistic. A rigorous calculation for this scenario shows that our naive estimate for one-year survival would converge to about $0.846$—a colossal overestimation from the true value of $0.5$! [@problem_id:4576772] This isn't just a statistical fine point; it's the difference between telling a patient they have a 50% chance versus an 85% chance of surviving the year. The principle is clear: ignoring delayed entry systematically inflates survival estimates and underestimates risk. [@problem_id:4962211] [@problem_id:4605638]

### The Correct Way of Seeing: Adjusting the Risk Set

So, how do we escape this illusion? The solution is beautifully simple in concept: we must be honest about what we know and when we know it. We cannot give a person "credit" for surviving during a period when they were not under our observation.

In survival analysis, the core calculation at any time $t$ revolves around the **risk set**. To estimate the hazard—the instantaneous risk of an event—we compute a ratio: the number of people who had an event at time $t$ divided by the number of people who *could have* had an event at time $t$. This denominator is the risk set. The mistake of immortal time bias is to put people into the risk set before they have even arrived at our study's "party."

The correct procedure is to define the risk set dynamically. An individual $i$ is not at risk in our study until they officially enter at their specific entry time, $E_i$. From that moment on, they are part of the risk set until they either experience the event or are right-censored (e.g., they move away or the study ends). This means the minimal data we need for each person is a triple: $(E_i, X_i, \Delta_i)$, where $E_i$ is the entry time, $X_i$ is the [exit time](@entry_id:190603) (due to event or censoring), and $\Delta_i$ is an indicator telling us which one it was. [@problem_id:4576982]

With this information, the rule for constructing the risk set at any time $t$ is simple and intuitive: individual $i$ is in the risk set if and only if $E_i \le t \le X_i$. That is, they must have entered the study, and they must not have left it yet. [@problem_id:4962098] By following this rule, we ensure that the denominator of our risk calculation at any instant properly reflects the pool of people who are truly under observation and eligible to experience the event. The size of the risk set will now correctly increase as new subjects enter and decrease as they exit, painting an honest picture of the cohort's dynamic reality. [@problem_id:4605638]

### The Edge of Knowledge: The Problem of Identifiability

Even with this powerful and correct method, there is a final, profound lesson about the limits of knowledge. Let's return to our patient registry. Suppose the very first patient was enrolled on January 1st, 2010. Let's call this earliest entry time $t_0$. Using our correct risk set definition, we can accurately estimate the trajectory of survival for patients *after* 2010. But what can we say about the [survival probability](@entry_id:137919) in 2009, or 2008?

The honest answer is: **nothing**. At least, not from this data alone.

The data are completely silent about the period before the first person was observed. Since no one was in the risk set before $t_0$, we have zero information about the hazard of the event in the interval $[0, t_0)$. This means we cannot estimate the absolute survival probability from diagnosis, $S(t) = \Pr(T > t)$. The best we can do is estimate the *conditional* [survival probability](@entry_id:137919): $\Pr(T > t \mid T \ge t_0)$, which is the probability of surviving past time $t$ *given that you already survived to time* $t_0$. [@problem_id:4989583]

This is the statistical concept of **identifiability**. The absolute survival curve is not identifiable if our data is truncated. We can learn its shape after $t_0$, but we cannot know its absolute level. To find the true, unconditional survival rate, we would need external information or have to make strong, untestable assumptions about what happened in the unobserved past. [@problem_id:4989583] This is a humbling reminder that even our most sophisticated methods can only report on the world we have observed.

Yet, this limitation also reveals its own solution. If our study is designed such that we capture at least some individuals right from their true time origin ($t=0$), then the earliest entry time becomes $t_0=0$. The unidentifiable interval vanishes! In this case, the conditional survival $\Pr(T > t \mid T \ge 0)$ becomes the same as the absolute survival $\Pr(T > t)$, and the entire survival curve becomes knowable. [@problem_id:4989583] The problem of the late arrival is solved simply by ensuring that someone was there from the beginning.
