## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

In the last chapter, we were introduced to a rather strange beast: the Fermi arc. We learned that on the surface of a special kind of material called a Weyl semimetal, the electrons are not confined to the usual closed loops of a Fermi surface. Instead, they live on open line segments—like highways that seem to begin and end in the middle of nowhere. These arcs are the surface footprints of the bizarre topological dance happening in the bulk of the material.

Now, a reasonable person might ask: So what? Is this just a physicist's curiosity, a peculiar squiggle on a graph, or does it lead to something real and useful? It's a fair question. And the answer is a resounding "yes!" These strange highways on the edge of a crystal are not just a theoretical oddity; they are the gateways to a whole new world of physical phenomena and potential technologies. We are about to embark on a journey to see where these highways lead, from seeing them with our own "electron cameras" to watching them conduct electricity between parallel worlds.

### The Art of Seeing the Invisible Highway

Before we can use a new discovery, we must first be certain it's really there. How can we be sure that these Fermi arcs, these one-dimensional electronic roads, actually exist? You can't just look at a crystal and see them. We need a special kind of camera, one that can take a picture not of the atoms, but of the electrons' momentum and energy.

That camera is a technique called Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy, or ARPES. In an ARPES experiment, we shine a bright light on the material's surface, which knocks electrons out. By measuring the direction and energy of these escaping electrons, we can reconstruct a "traffic map" of the electronic states on the surface. For a normal metal, this map shows what you might expect: closed loops, like roundabouts or racetracks, where electrons can happily travel in circles [@problem_id:1827872].

But when we point our ARPES camera at the surface of a Weyl semimetal, we see something that, by all conventional rules, should not exist. We find a bright, sharp line of states that is *not* a closed loop. It's an open arc. It’s a road that just starts at one point and stops at another, with no connection back to its beginning. This observation of an unclosed line segment of states is the definitive, smoking-gun signature of a Fermi arc. It's the first proof that we've found one of these topological highways [@problem_id:1827872].

Our confidence in this picture is bolstered by computer simulations. When we model a slab of a Weyl semimetal, these peculiar surface-[bound states](@article_id:136008) appear in the calculations exactly where the theory of topology predicts they should. If we run the same simulation for an ordinary material, they are nowhere to be found [@problem_id:2454063]. This perfect agreement between deep theory, sophisticated computation, and precise experiment is what gives us the certainty to say that these arcs are real. The highways are open for business.

### The Chiral Express: A New Way to Travel

So, we have these highways. What happens when an electron starts moving on one? This is where the story gets truly fantastical. Imagine our slab of material is like two parallel universes: the top surface and the bottom surface. The Fermi arcs are strange, one-way streets within each of these universes. Now, what happens if we apply a magnetic field perpendicular to these surfaces? The magnetic field acts as a cosmic traffic controller, but it also does something much more magical: it opens up one-way teleporters between the two universes.

These "teleporters" are the special chiral Landau levels that exist in the bulk of the material, a direct consequence of the Weyl points. In a magnetic field, an electron moving along the Fermi arc on the top surface is pushed by the Lorentz force until it reaches the end of the arc—the projection of a bulk Weyl point. At this terminus, it can't go any further on the surface. Instead, it "jumps" into one of these chiral Landau levels and shoots straight through the bulk of the crystal to the bottom surface, like an express elevator [@problem_id:2812641].

Upon arriving at the bottom surface, it lands on the a Fermi arc there and travels along it until it reaches the *other* Weyl point projection. From there, it jumps into the *other* chiral Landau level (which goes in the opposite direction) and zips back to the top surface, completing a giant, spectacular loop. This hybrid trajectory—part surface travel, part bulk teleportation—is known as a "Weyl orbit."

This isn't just a fun story; it has stunning and measurable consequences.

First, it allows for **nonlocal transport**. Because the Weyl orbit physically connects the top and bottom surfaces, you can inject an electrical current into the top surface and measure a voltage on the bottom surface. The Weyl orbit acts as a wire that traverses the crystal, a direct conduction path between two points that are, in ordinary circumstances, isolated from each other [@problem_id:2818355].

Second, because this is the quantum world, the entire Weyl orbit is quantized. Its allowed energy levels are discrete, like the rungs of a ladder. This quantization leads to beautiful [quantum oscillations](@article_id:141861): as you vary the strength of the magnetic field, properties like [electrical resistance](@article_id:138454) wobble up and down in a regular pattern. Crucially, the frequency of these oscillations depends on the *thickness* of the crystal slab. This thickness dependence is the ultimate proof that the electrons are really making the full journey from top to bottom and back again [@problem_id:2812641]. These [quantized energy levels](@article_id:140417) also mean that the system can absorb particles of light—microwaves, for instance—at a very specific [resonant frequency](@article_id:265248). The absorption frequency turns out to have a beautifully simple relationship with the slab thickness, $d$, and the velocity of the electron on its chiral express journey, $v_F$. A hypothetical model suggests this frequency could be as simple as $\omega_{\text{res}} = \frac{\pi v_F}{d}$ [@problem_id:1767791].

### Building with Topological Lego

The unique properties of Fermi arcs make them fascinating building blocks for a new generation of electronic and quantum devices. Their behavior is unlike anything found in conventional materials.

For instance, what if we form a junction by joining a standard [p-type semiconductor](@article_id:145273) with the surface of a Weyl semimetal? We create a new type of electronic component. When a forward voltage $V_a$ is applied, electrons can tunnel from the semiconductor into the Fermi arc states. Because the Fermi arc has a very peculiar [density of states](@article_id:147400) (in the simplest models, it's constant), the way the current $J$ depends on the voltage is unique. Instead of the exponential behavior of a typical diode, we find a power-law relationship, something of the form $J \propto (eV_a - \delta_p)^{3/2}$ for a certain voltage range [@problem_id:235847]. This unique characteristic, dictated by the topological nature of the final states, could be exploited to design novel electronic circuits.

The influence of Fermi arcs extends into the quantum realm. Imagine placing a single [artificial atom](@article_id:140761), a [quantum dot](@article_id:137542), near the surface of a Weyl semimetal. The quantum dot and the Fermi arc can exchange electrons. The arc acts as a very special kind of environment, or "bath," for the quantum dot. Due to the linear, one-dimensional nature of the arc states, the way they perturb the energy level of the quantum dot is unique. The level broadening, $\Gamma(E)$, which is a measure of how quickly an electron can hop between the dot and the surface, becomes constant with energy—a direct fingerprint of the arc's unusual dispersion [@problem_id:90688]. This provides a new tool for controlling and probing single quantum systems, a crucial task for building quantum computers.

### The Idea That Got Away: Echoes in Other Worlds

Perhaps the most profound aspect of a great idea in physics is its universality. The principles behind Fermi arcs are so fundamental that they are not limited to electrons in a crystal. The same ideas pop up in completely different physical systems, a beautiful testament to the unity of nature's laws.

Consider light. By fabricating materials with periodic structures on the scale of the wavelength of light—so-called [photonic crystals](@article_id:136853)—we can control the flow of photons in much the same way a semiconductor crystal controls the flow of electrons. It's possible to design a 3D photonic crystal that exactly mimics the physics of a Weyl semimetal. And what do we find on its surface? You guessed it: **photonic Fermi arcs** [@problem_id:782227]. These are one-dimensional, topologically protected pathways for light. This is not just a clever analogy; it opens the door to creating optical devices, like [waveguides](@article_id:197977), that are exceptionally robust against defects and imperfections. One could even consider the thermodynamics of a "gas" of photons living on these arcs, which would exhibit its own unique signature, like a specific heat that scales linearly with temperature, $c_A(T) \propto T$.

The connection gets even deeper, touching the very fabric of quantum mechanics: entanglement. Let’s take the ground state of a Weyl semimetal—the state of lowest energy where all the quantum particles are settled. Now, let’s mathematically divide the system into two halves and ask: "How much are these two halves quantum-mechanically entangled with each other?" The answer is encoded in a mathematical object called the entanglement Hamiltonian. Astonishingly, the spectrum of this entanglement Hamiltonian contains its own gapless modes that form a perfect mimic of the physical [surface states](@article_id:137428)—an **entanglement Fermi arc** [@problem_id:1239148]. This means the topology of the bulk material is not just reflected on its physical boundary, but also in the abstract, informational structure of its [quantum entanglement](@article_id:136082). The highway on the edge of the crystal is a ghost, a shadow, of the deepest quantum correlations hidden within.

From a strange squiggle in an experiment to a blueprint for new technologies and a reflection of fundamental quantum information, the Fermi arc has taken us on a remarkable tour. It shows us, once again, that by looking carefully at the strange and unexpected corners of the universe, we often find the most beautiful and powerful ideas.
