## Introduction
In the fields of [quantum chemistry](@article_id:139699) and [molecular physics](@article_id:190388), understanding the electronic state of a molecule is paramount. The [term symbol](@article_id:171424) is a profoundly efficient notation developed for this purpose, acting as a "passport" that provides a comprehensive description of the collective electronic properties within a [diatomic molecule](@article_id:194019). At first, this symbolic language, represented as $^{2S+1}\Lambda_{g/u}^{(\pm)}$, can appear cryptic and inaccessible. The knowledge gap for many is translating this dense code into a physical understanding of the molecule's behavior, from its [angular momentum](@article_id:144331) and [electron spin](@article_id:136522) to its [fundamental symmetries](@article_id:160762).

This article aims to demystify [diatomic molecule](@article_id:194019) [term symbols](@article_id:151081), transforming them from abstract labels into powerful predictive tools. Across the following chapters, you will gain a clear and structured understanding of this fundamental concept.

First, in "Principles and Mechanisms", we will dissect the [term symbol](@article_id:171424) piece by piece. We will explore how each component—the central Greek letter, the left superscript, and the right-hand subscripts and superscripts—corresponds to a distinct physical property. You will learn the rules for constructing a complete [term symbol](@article_id:171424) from a molecule's [electron configuration](@article_id:146901), for cases ranging from simple closed-shells to more [complex systems](@article_id:137572) with [unpaired electrons](@article_id:137500).

Next, in "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections," we will see the [term symbol](@article_id:171424) in action. We will discover its crucial role in [spectroscopy](@article_id:137328), where it provides the "grammar" for interpreting molecular spectra through [selection rules](@article_id:140290). We will also explore how [term symbols](@article_id:151081) allow us to predict material properties like [magnetism](@article_id:144732), understand the fine details of [molecular structure](@article_id:139615), and bridge concepts across diverse fields such as [thermodynamics](@article_id:140627) and [chemical dynamics](@article_id:176965). By the end, you will not only be able to read the story told by a [term symbol](@article_id:171424) but also appreciate its deep connections to the observable world.

{'applications': '## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections\n\nAfter our journey through the principles and mechanisms of [molecular term symbols](@article_id:166940), you might be left with a feeling of satisfaction, but also a question: What is this all for? Are these elegant labels, these collections of Greek letters and superscripts, merely a classification scheme for a quantum physicist’s catalogue? Nothing could be further from the truth. These [term symbols](@article_id:151081) are not the end of the story; they are the key to a vast and interconnected landscape of physical phenomena. They are a Rosetta Stone, allowing us to translate the language of light and energy into a deep understanding of molecular behavior, from the strength of a [chemical bond](@article_id:144598) to the composition of distant stars.\n\n### Decoding the Light: The Grammar of Spectroscopy\n\nThe most direct and powerful application of [term symbols](@article_id:151081) is in [spectroscopy](@article_id:137328), the study of how matter interacts with light. A molecule, like a finely tuned instrument, can only absorb or emit light of very specific frequencies, creating a unique spectrum of lines. Why these specific lines and not others? The [term symbols](@article_id:151081) tell us the rules of the game. These are not arbitrary rules; they are profound consequences of the [conservation laws](@article_id:146396) of physics, written in the language of symmetry.\n\nAn [electronic transition](@article_id:169944), where a molecule jumps from one energy state to another by absorbing or emitting a [photon](@article_id:144698), must obey a strict set of "[selection rules](@article_id:140290)." For an [electric dipole transition](@article_id:142502) (the most common kind), these rules are dictated by the [term symbols](@article_id:151081) of the initial and final states. For instance, the total [electron spin](@article_id:136522) must be conserved ($\\Delta S = 0$), as the [photon](@article_id:144698)’s [electric field](@article_id:193832) does not easily interact with spin. The projection of [orbital angular momentum](@article_id:190809) can change by at most one unit ($\\Delta \\Lambda = 0, \\pm 1$), reflecting the [angular momentum](@article_id:144331) carried away by the [photon](@article_id:144698).\n\nMost beautifully, for a molecule with a center of symmetry, a transition must always connect a state of [even parity](@article_id:172459) (*gerade*, or $g$) with a state of [odd parity](@article_id:175336) (*[ungerade](@article_id:147471)*, or $u$). A $g \\rightarrow g$ or $u \\rightarrow u$ transition is forbidden [@problem_id:1990406]. One way to picture this is to realize that the [photon](@article_id:144698) itself has [odd parity](@article_id:175336). For the universe\'s books to balance, if a molecule absorbs or emits a [photon](@article_id:144698), its own [parity](@article_id:140431) must flip. A transition like $A^1\\Pi_g \\rightarrow B^1\\Delta_g$ is simply not allowed, no matter how much light you shine on the molecule. This "Laporte rule" is a stark and stunning example of how abstract symmetry governs the visible, tangible world.\n\n### Beyond the Lines: Fine Structure and Subtle Couplings\n\nIf we look closely at a [spectral line](@article_id:192914), we often find it\'s not a single line at all, but a cluster of closely spaced "[fine structure](@article_id:140367)" lines. This is the molecule whispering more of its secrets. Term symbols help us understand this too. The labels $S$ and $\\Lambda$ treat the electron\'s spin and [orbital angular momentum](@article_id:190809) as separate things. But they are not. They are both movements of charge, and they create tiny [magnetic fields](@article_id:271967) that interact. This is [spin-orbit coupling](@article_id:143026).\n\nThis coupling causes a term like $^3\\Pi$ (where $S=1, \\Lambda=1$) to split into several distinct [energy levels](@article_id:155772), each labeled by a new [quantum number](@article_id:148035) $\\Omega$, the total [electronic angular momentum](@article_id:198440) projected on the molecular axis. For a $^3\\Pi$ term, the possible $\\Omega$ values are $0, 1,$ and $2$. Hund\'s rules, extended to molecules, even tell us the energy ordering of these split levels based on how full the [molecular orbitals](@article_id:265736) are [@problem_id:1994578]. This [fine structure](@article_id:140367) is a direct measurement of the internal magnetic environment of the molecule.\n\nThe dance of couplings doesn\'t stop there. The entire molecule rotates, and this rotation is also quantized. The electronic state of the molecule can place powerful constraints on this rotation. Consider a molecule in a $^1\\Delta$ state. The symbol $\\Delta$ tells us $\\Lambda=2$. This means the electron cloud is already circulating, carrying two units of [angular momentum](@article_id:144331) along the molecular axis. The molecule\'s body, the nuclear framework, rotates perpendicular to this axis. The [total angular momentum](@article_id:155254) of the molecule, labeled by the [quantum number](@article_id:148035) $J$, must be at least as large as its projection onto any axis. Since the projection is $\\Omega = \\Lambda = 2$, the total [angular momentum [quantum numbe](@article_id:171575)r](@article_id:148035) $J$ can be $2, 3, 4, ...$ but it can *never* be $0$ or $1$ [@problem_id:2004246]. A molecule in a $\\Delta$ state is fundamentally incapable of not rotating! This is a beautiful example of the intricate, non-negotiable coupling between different motions within a single quantum system.\n\n### From Symbols to Substance: Predicting Material Properties\n\nTerm symbols are more than just descriptions of energy states; they are powerful predictors of a molecule\'s tangible physical and chemical properties.\n\nWhat is the [ground state](@article_id:150434) of the [oxygen molecule](@article_id:191964), $O_2$? Experiment and theory agree it is $^3\\Sigma_g^-$. This single label is packed with chemical insight. The multiplicity \'3\' tells us $S=1$, meaning the molecule has two [unpaired electrons](@article_id:137500) with parallel spins. This immediately explains a famous classroom demonstration: liquid oxygen is paramagnetic and will stick to a strong magnet. In contrast, the [ground state](@article_id:150434) of dinitrogen, $N_2$, is $^1\\Sigma_g^+$, a [singlet state](@article_id:154234) ($S=0$). All its [electrons](@article_id:136939) are paired, so it is diamagnetic. The [term symbol](@article_id:171424) tells us the magnetic character of a substance at a glance [@problem_id:2463329].\n\nFurthermore, the [term symbol](@article_id:171424) is intimately linked to the molecule\'s [electronic configuration](@article_id:271610), which in turn determines the nature of the [chemical bond](@article_id:144598). If we know a molecule\'s [ground state](@article_id:150434) is, say, $^3\\Sigma_g^-$, we can deduce that its outermost [electrons](@article_id:136939) must be in a specific configuration—in this case, two [electrons](@article_id:136939) in a degenerate $\\pi$ orbital set. By filling the [molecular orbitals](@article_id:265736) from the bottom up to achieve this configuration, we can count the number of [electrons](@article_id:136939) in bonding versus anti-[bonding orbitals](@article_id:165458) and thereby calculate the [bond order](@article_id:142054), a direct measure of the bond\'s strength [@problem_id:2235746]. From a flicker of light and a quantum label, we can infer the very glue holding the molecule together.\n\n### A Bridge Across Disciplines\n\nThe utility of [term symbols](@article_id:151081) extends far beyond the realm of [molecular physics](@article_id:190388), forming a crucial bridge to other scientific disciplines.\n\nConsider **[thermodynamics](@article_id:140627) and [statistical mechanics](@article_id:139122)**. To understand the behavior of a gas at high [temperature](@article_id:145715)—inside an engine, in a [chemical reactor](@article_id:203969), or in the atmosphere of a star—we need to know its [heat capacity](@article_id:137100). This depends on how much energy the gas can store. Molecules can store energy not just in motion, but in their [electronic states](@article_id:171282). The population of these states is governed by the Boltzmann distribution, which depends critically on the energy and the *[degeneracy](@article_id:140992)* of each state. Where does this [degeneracy](@article_id:140992) come from? The [term symbol](@article_id:171424)! The [oxygen molecule](@article_id:191964)\'s [ground state](@article_id:150434), $^3\\Sigma_g^-$, has a [degeneracy](@article_id:140992) of $3$, while itsfirst [excited state](@article_id:260959), $^1\\Delta_g$, has a [degeneracy](@article_id:140992) of $2$. This difference in [degeneracy](@article_id:140992) has a direct and measurable impact on the populations of these states at any given [temperature](@article_id:145715), and thus on the thermodynamic properties of oxygen gas [@problem_id:492193].\n\nIn the world of **[chemical dynamics](@article_id:176965)**, [term symbols](@article_id:151081) help us answer the most fundamental questions: Where do molecules come from, and where do they go? The Wigner-Witmer correlation rules act as a form of "[molecular genetics](@article_id:184222)." They dictate which [electronic states](@article_id:171282) of two approaching atoms can combine to form a particular molecular electronic state, and conversely, into which [atomic states](@article_id:169371) a molecule must dissociate. For example, if we collide two nitrogen atoms, both in their $^4S$ [ground state](@article_id:150434), the rules tell us exactly which molecular states of $N_2$ can be formed—a septet, a quintet, a triplet, and a singlet, each with a specific symmetry ($^7\\Sigma_u^+$, $^5\\Sigma_g^+$, $^3\\Sigma_u^+$, and $^1\\Sigma_g^+$) [@problem_id:1202828]. Similarly, if we excite a molecule to a $^3\\Delta_u$ state, the rules forbid it from dissociating into two identical atoms; the atoms must be in different [electronic states](@article_id:171282) [@problem_id:1364031]. These rules are essential for understanding chemical [reaction mechanisms](@article_id:149010), [photochemistry](@article_id:140439), and the formation of molecules in interstellar space.\n\n### The Modern View: Probing Molecules and Validating Computations\n\nToday, our tools for studying molecules are more powerful than ever, and [term symbols](@article_id:151081) remain central to interpreting our findings.\n\nIn **[photoelectron spectroscopy](@article_id:143467) (PES)**, we blast a molecule with high-energy [photons](@article_id:144819) to knock out an electron. By measuring the energy of the ejected electron, we can deduce which orbital it came from. When an electron is removed from a neutral molecule like $N_2$ (which is in a $^1\\Sigma_g^+$ state), the resulting ion, $N_2^+$, is left in an [excited state](@article_id:260959). The [term symbol](@article_id:171424) of this final ionic state depends directly on the orbital from which the electron was removed. Removing an electron from the $1\\pi_u$ orbital results in an ion in a $^2\\Pi_u$ state, while removing it from the $3\\sigma_g$ orbital yields a $^2\\Sigma_g^+$ state [@problem_id:2463352]. Thus, the spectrum of final ionic states, identified by their [term symbols](@article_id:151081), provides a direct experimental map of the molecule’s [electronic structure](@article_id:144664).\n\nFinally, in **[computational chemistry](@article_id:142545)**, we use computers to solve the Schrödinger equation and predict molecular properties. But how do we trust the computer\'s answer? Term symbols provide a critical check on reality. A proper [wavefunction](@article_id:146946) must be an [eigenfunction](@article_id:148536) of the [spin operator](@article_id:149221) $\\hat{S}^2$, with an [eigenvalue](@article_id:154400) of $S(S+1)$. For the true triplet ($S=1$) [ground state](@article_id:150434) of $O_2$, this value must be $1(1+1)=2$. Sometimes, however, a common type of approximate calculation will produce a "spin-contaminated" state, a nonsensical mixture of different [spin states](@article_id:148942). This pathological behavior often manifests with a calculated [expectation value](@article_id:150467) $\\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle$ that is not a clean integer, for example, a value of $\\approx 1.0$. Knowledge of spin theory and [term symbols](@article_id:151081) immediately tells us that the calculation has erroneously mixed the true [triplet state](@article_id:156211) with a singlet ($S=0$) state, signaling a problem with the theoretical method for this particular molecule [@problem_id:2463367].\n\nFrom [spectroscopy](@article_id:137328) to [chemical bonding](@article_id:137722), from [thermodynamics](@article_id:140627) to [computational science](@article_id:150036), the humble [term symbol](@article_id:171424) proves itself to be an exceptionally powerful and unifying concept. It is not just a label, but a profound and compact expression of the [fundamental symmetries](@article_id:160762) that shape the molecular world. It is a testament to the beauty of physics, where a few simple rules and symbols can unlock a universe of complexity and connection.', '#text': '## Principles and Mechanisms\n\nImagine you\'re a border agent for the quantum world. A molecule\'s electronic state approaches, and you need to see its papers. What would be on that passport? What information would identify it completely, distinguishing it from all other possible states? For a [diatomic molecule](@article_id:194019), this passport is called a **[term symbol](@article_id:171424)**. It\'s a marvel of notational efficiency, a compact code that tells us almost everything we need to know about the [collective behavior](@article_id:146002) of the molecule\'s [electrons](@article_id:136939): their [angular momentum](@article_id:144331), their spin, and how they arrange themselves in space. It looks something like this: $^{2S+1}\\Lambda_{g/u}^{(\\pm)}$. At first glance, it might seem as cryptic as an ancient rune. But once you learn the language, you see it’s not just a label; it’s a story. Our mission in this chapter is to learn to read that story.\n\n### Decoding the Symbols: Angular Momentum, Spin, and Symmetry\n\nLet’s dissect this "passport," piece by piece. We\'ll find that each symbol corresponds to a fundamental physical property of the electronic state, a property rooted in the symmetries of the molecule itself [@problem_id:2653059].\n\n#### The Big Letter in the Middle ($\\Lambda$): Electronic Motion Around the Bond\n\nThe central character in our [term symbol](@article_id:171424) is a Greek capital letter, like $\\Sigma$, $\\Pi$, or $\\Delta$. This letter tells us about the [orbital angular momentum](@article_id:190809) of the [electrons](@article_id:136939) as they swarm around the axis connecting the two nuclei. Think of it like this: if the [electrons](@article_id:136939) were tiny planets, the internuclear axis is the sun they [orbit](@article_id:136657). The [quantum number](@article_id:148035) $\\Lambda$ represents the total projection of their [orbital angular momentum](@article_id:190809) onto this axis.\n\n-   If $\\Lambda = 0$, the state is called a $\\Sigma$ state. There is no net [orbital motion](@article_id:162362) *around* the axis. You can picture the electron cloud as being rotationally symmetric, like a perfectly smooth cylinder or a football aligned with the axis.\n-   If $\\Lambda = 1$, we call it a $\\Pi$ state. Here, there is one unit of [angular momentum](@article_id:144331) about the axis. The electron cloud has a node along the axis itself, like two parallel sausages of charge.\n-   If $\\Lambda = 2$, it\'s a $\\Delta$ state, with two units of [angular momentum](@article_id:144331).\n\nSo, if an experiment tells you an [excited state](@article_id:260959) of a molecule has $\\Lambda=2$, you immediately know it\'s a $\\Delta$ state [@problem_id:1978808]. Conversely, if a calculation labels a state as $^{3}\\Delta_{u}$, you can decode that $\\Lambda$ must be 2 [@problem_id:2004581].\n\n#### The Superscript on the Left ($2S+1$): The Electron Spin Team\n\nElectrons are not just orbiting charges; they also have an intrinsic property called **spin**. You can crudely picture it as the electron spinning on its own axis, creating a tiny [magnetic moment](@article_id:157922). In a molecule with many [electrons](@article_id:136939), these spins can team up. They can pair up, with one spinning "up" and another "down," canceling each other out. Or, they can align, all spinning in the same direction, creating a larger net spin.\n\nThe [total spin](@article_id:152841) is quantified by the [quantum number](@article_id:148035) $S$.\n-   If all electron spins are perfectly paired, the [total spin](@article_id:152841) is $S=0$.\n-   If two [electrons](@article_id:136939) are unpaired and aligned, the [total spin](@article_id:152841) is $S = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$.\n-   For a single unpaired electron, as in the [hydrogen molecular ion](@article_id:173007) $\\text{H}_2^+$, we have $S = \\frac{1}{2}$ [@problem_id:2032537].\n\nThe superscript in the [term symbol](@article_id:171424) isn\'t $S$ itself, but the **[spin multiplicity](@article_id:263371)**, calculated as $2S+1$. This number tells you how many possible orientations the [total spin](@article_id:152841) vector has in a [magnetic field](@article_id:152802).\n-   For $S=0$, the multiplicity is $2(0)+1=1$. This is a **singlet** state.\n-   For $S=1/2$, the multiplicity is $2(1/2)+1=2$. This is a **doublet** state.\n-   For $S=1$, the multiplicity is $2(1)+1=3$. This is a **triplet** state.\n\nSo, a superscript \'3\' tells us we have a [triplet state](@article_id:156211) with $S=1$ [@problem_id:1978808] [@problem_id:2004581]. This is not just abstract bookkeeping. A molecule in a [triplet state](@article_id:156211), like oxygen, is magnetic because its spins are aligned. A singlet molecule is not.\n\n#### The Subscripts and Superscripts on the Right: Parity and Reflection\n\nThe remaining labels, $g/u$ and $\\pm$, are perhaps the most profound, as they speak directly to the molecule\'s [fundamental symmetries](@article_id:160762).\n\nThe subscript $g$ (*gerade*, German for "even") or $u$ (*[ungerade](@article_id:147471)*, "odd") describes the [wavefunction](@article_id:146946)\'s **[parity](@article_id:140431)**. Imagine a homonuclear [diatomic molecule](@article_id:194019), like N$_2$ or O$_2$. It has a perfect center of symmetry, right in the middle of the bond. What happens if we perform an inversion operation, flipping every point in the electron cloud through this center? If the [wavefunction](@article_id:146946) remains exactly the same, it has *gerade* [parity](@article_id:140431). If the [wavefunction](@article_id:146946) flips its sign (the phase changes by 180 degrees), it has *[ungerade](@article_id:147471)* [parity](@article_id:140431).\n\nThis label is a direct consequence of the molecule\'s physical symmetry. A heteronuclear molecule, like CO, has no center of symmetry. The inversion operation isn\'t a symmetry of the molecule, so asking what happens upon inversion is meaningless. Therefore, the $g/u$ labels are *only* used for [homonuclear diatomics](@article_id:154980) [@problem_id:2653042]. This illustrates a beautiful principle: the labels we use are not arbitrary; they must correspond to actual symmetries of the system.\n\nFinally, for the special case of $\\Sigma$ states ($\\Lambda=0$), we add a superscript, $+$ or $-$. Since a $\\Sigma$ state has no net rotation around the axis, its [wavefunction](@article_id:146946) must have a simple behavior when reflected through any plane that *contains* the internuclear axis. If the [wavefunction](@article_id:146946) is unchanged by this [reflection](@article_id:161616), it\'s labeled $+$. If it flips sign, it\'s labeled $-$. For any state with $\\Lambda > 0$ (like $\\Pi$ or $\\Delta$), this [reflection](@article_id:161616) simply turns the "clockwise" orbiting state into the "counter-clockwise" one, so these states are not [eigenfunctions](@article_id:154211) of the [reflection](@article_id:161616), and the $\\pm$ label is not used [@problem_id:2653059].\n\n### From Orbitals to States: Assembling the Term Symbol\n\nNow that we know what the pieces mean, how do we construct a [term symbol](@article_id:171424) from a molecule\'s known [electron configuration](@article_id:146901)? The process is like quantum accounting, following a few simple rules.\n\n#### The Elegance of the Closed Shell\n\nLet\'s begin with the simplest and most common situation: a **closed-shell configuration**, where every molecular orbital is completely filled with two [electrons](@article_id:136939). The dinitrogen molecule, N$_2$, in its [ground state](@article_id:150434) is a perfect example [@problem_id:1366654].\n\nThe logic is beautifully simple. In every filled orbital, there is one electron with spin "up" and one with spin "down." Their spins cancel. Summing over all the filled orbitals, the [total spin](@article_id:152841) is zero: $S=0$. This gives a [spin multiplicity](@article_id:263371) of $1$ (a singlet). What about the [orbital angular momentum](@article_id:190809)? For every $\\sigma$ orbital, the projection is zero ($\\lambda=0$). For every filled $\\pi$ orbital, there are two [electrons](@article_id:136939) with $\\lambda=+1$ and two with $\\lambda=-1$. Their contributions cancel out perfectly. The same holds true for $\\delta$ orbitals and beyond. Therefore, the [total orbital angular momentum](@article_id:264808) projection is also zero: $\\Lambda=0$ (a $\\Sigma$ state). Finally, a closed shell is the most symmetric possible arrangement of [electrons](@article_id:136939); it is always symmetric with respect to [reflection](@article_id:161616). Thus, it must have a $+$ superscript.\n\nThis leads to a powerful general rule: **any [diatomic molecule](@article_id:194019) with a completely filled set of [molecular orbitals](@article_id:265736) must have a $^1\\Sigma^+$ [term symbol](@article_id:171424)** [@problem_id:2004578]. If it\'s a homonuclear molecule, we also need the [parity](@article_id:140431). Since the overall [parity](@article_id:140431) is the product of the parities of all occupied orbitals, and because $g \\times g = g$ and $u \\times u = g$, any *filled* orbital, regardless of its own [parity](@article_id:140431), contributes a $g$ factor to the total. The result is that a closed-shell homonuclear diatomic will always be $^1\\Sigma_g^+$. This is the [ground state](@article_id:150434) of N$_2$.\n\n#### States with a Single Unpaired Electron\n\nWhat if we have just one electron, as in $\\text{H}_2^+$? Or if we knock one electron out of a closed shell, as in $\\text{N}_2^+$? Here, the [term symbol](@article_id:171424) is simply determined by the properties of the single, lonely electron in its partially filled orbital.\n\nFor the [ground state](@article_id:150434) of $\\text{H}_2^+$, the single electron resides in the lowest-energy molecular orbital, the $1\\sigma_g$ orbital.\n-   One electron means $S=1/2 \\implies$ a doublet ($^2$).\n-   It\'s in a $\\sigma$ orbital ($\\lambda=0$) $\\implies \\Lambda=0$ (a $\\Sigma$ state).\n-   The orbital has $g$ [parity](@article_id:140431) $\\implies$ the state has $g$ [parity](@article_id:140431).\n-   A single electron in a $\\sigma$ orbital is always symmetric to [reflection](@article_id:161616) $\\implies +$.\nPutting it all together, we get $^2\\Sigma_g^+$ [@problem_id:2032537]. The same logic applies to $\\text{N}_2^+$, whose [ground state](@article_id:150434) comes from removing one electron from the $\\sigma_g(2p)$ orbital of N$_2$, also resulting in a $^2\\Sigma_g^+$ state [@problem_id:2787553].\n\n### The Pauli Principle\'s Subtle Dance: The Case of Equivalent Electrons\n\nThings get really interesting when we have more than one electron in the *same* degenerate set of orbitals, like the two [electrons](@article_id:136939) in the $\\pi$ orbitals of the [oxygen molecule](@article_id:191964), O$_2$. These are called **[equivalent electrons](@article_id:201078)**. Naively, you might try to just add up the [quantum numbers](@article_id:145064). Two [electrons](@article_id:136939) in a $\\pi$ orbital have individual [angular momentum](@article_id:144331) projections $\\lambda = \\pm 1$. The possible totals for $\\Lambda = |\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2|$ could be $|(+1)+(+1)| = 2$ (a $\\Delta$ state) or $|(+1)+(-1)| = 0$ (a $\\Sigma$ state). The two spins ($s=1/2$) can form a [total spin](@article_id:152841) of $S=0$ (singlet) or $S=1$ (triplet).\n\nBut we can\'t just have all [combinations](@article_id:262445). The **Pauli Exclusion Principle** steps in. It dictates that the total [wavefunction](@article_id:146946) (spatial part multiplied by spin part) must be antisymmetric upon the exchange of any two identical [electrons](@article_id:136939). This is a deep and fundamental rule of nature. It acts as'}
