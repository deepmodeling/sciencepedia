## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The principles of [quantum spin](@article_id:137265), which we have explored in the previous chapter, may seem at first to be abstract and far removed from our daily lives. But nothing could be further from the truth. The subtle, almost ghostly property of an electron's spin has been harnessed to create a technological revolution that sits in your pocket, powers a global information network, and pushes the frontiers of computing and medicine. More than that, it offers tantalizing clues to some of nature's deepest secrets, from the workings of a bird's internal compass to the very fabric of quantum reality. In this chapter, we will take a journey through this spintronic universe, starting with the devices that are already all around us and venturing out to the cutting edge of what is possible.
