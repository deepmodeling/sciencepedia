## Introduction
Medicaid, the nation's public health insurance program for millions of low-income Americans, operates on a complex and often misunderstood set of rules. Determining who is eligible is not a simple matter of being "poor"; it involves a sophisticated interplay of federal law, state policy, personal finances, and even family structure. Many attempts to explain the program present it as a daunting checklist of income levels and categories, which fails to capture the underlying logic and the profound human impact of its design. This article moves beyond a simple recitation of rules to explore the foundational system that governs access to care. In the first chapter, "Principles and Mechanisms," we will dissect the constitutional bargain between federal and state governments, the blueprint for who must be covered, and the financial yardsticks used to measure need. Following that, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" will illustrate how these principles come to life, shaping the experiences of families, immigrants, and individuals with disabilities, and creating unique challenges at the intersection of law, medicine, and social work.

## Principles and Mechanisms

To truly understand who gets Medicaid and why, we can't just memorize a list of rules. That would be like trying to appreciate a grand symphony by reading the sheet music one note at a time. Instead, we must listen for the underlying themes, the harmonies and tensions that give the music its structure and its soul. The principles of Medicaid eligibility are not a random collection of statutes; they are the result of a profound constitutional dance, a set of intricate blueprints, and a series of deliberate, often difficult, societal choices.

### A Pact Between Governments

At its heart, the American system of government is a partnership, and Medicaid is a perfect example of this. The federal government in Washington, D.C., doesn't simply command the states to create a health insurance program for the poor. It can't. Instead, it makes an offer, a deal rooted in a powerful constitutional tool: the **Spending Clause**. This clause gives Congress the power to spend money for the "general Welfare," and with that power comes the ability to attach strings to the money it gives away [@problem_id:4491087].

The deal for Medicaid is this: the federal government will pay a large portion of a state's costs for insuring its low-income residents, but in return, the state must follow a set of federal rules. When a state accepts this deal, it creates a program that is both a **means-tested program**—meaning eligibility is determined by your financial resources—and an **entitlement**. This word, "entitlement," can be misunderstood. It doesn't mean everyone is entitled to the benefit; it means that anyone who *meets the pre-defined eligibility criteria* has a legal right to receive the benefit [@problem_id:4384197]. The state cannot simply run out of money and cap enrollment for the year; if you are eligible, you are in.

This is fundamentally different from a **social insurance** program like Medicare. Medicare is built on a principle of shared contribution; you (or your spouse) pay into the system through payroll taxes during your working years, and in return, you earn the right to benefits in your old age, regardless of your wealth. Medicaid, by contrast, is a safety net, financed by general tax revenues and designed to catch those who fall below a certain [economic threshold](@entry_id:194565).

But what happens if the federal government's "offer" becomes an offer you can't refuse? This question went all the way to the Supreme Court. When the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was passed, it sought to dramatically expand Medicaid. The original law told states that if they didn't agree to this new expansion, they risked losing *all* of their federal Medicaid funding, including the money for their long-standing, existing programs. In the landmark case *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius*, the Court said this crossed a line from persuasion into **coercion**. It was no longer a deal; it was a threat. The Court's solution was elegant: it severed the threat, effectively making the ACA's Medicaid expansion a new, genuinely **optional** choice for states [@problem_id:4491087] [@problem_id:4491482]. This single decision is the key to understanding why, today, a person's access to healthcare can depend so dramatically on which side of a state line they live.

### The Eligibility Blueprint: Who's In?

Once a state accepts the basic Medicaid pact, it receives a blueprint—Title XIX of the Social Security Act—that outlines the terms. This blueprint contains two types of building blocks: **mandatory** populations and **optional** populations.

To get any federal money, a state **must** cover certain federally defined **mandatory** groups. These form the non-negotiable floor of the program. Think of them as the foundation of the house. They have historically included groups like:
*   Children and pregnant women below certain poverty levels.
*   The very poorest parents or caretaker relatives of children.
*   Most elderly and disabled individuals who receive cash assistance through the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. [@problem_id:4491116] [@problem_id:4384223]

Beyond this foundation, the blueprint offers states a wide array of **optional** groups they can choose to cover, with the federal government still sharing the cost. A state might choose to cover more children at higher incomes, or people who need nursing home care but have too much income for SSI. The single largest and most consequential optional group is the one created by the ACA: non-elderly adults without disabilities, primarily childless adults, who were historically left out of the program almost entirely. The choice to cover this group—the Medicaid expansion—is the single biggest lever of state-level variation in the program today.

### The Yardstick of Need

The term "means-tested" sounds simple, but how do you actually measure "means"? For decades, the rules were a bewildering mess, varying by state and by the category of person being considered, often involving complex calculations and strict limits on assets like cars or savings accounts.

The ACA sought to simplify this dramatically for most applicants by creating a single, uniform method for counting income: **Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI)** [@problem_id:4398087]. If you've ever filed a tax return, you've seen this concept. MAGI is essentially the Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) from your tax form, with a few minor additions. This was a revolutionary change, replacing dozens of different rulebooks with one that was linked to the federal tax system. For these MAGI-based groups, asset tests were eliminated entirely.

Income is measured against a national yardstick: the **Federal Poverty Level (FPL)**, an amount of annual income updated each year that is considered the minimum needed for a family of a certain size to meet its basic needs. For the ACA expansion, the statutory cutoff was set at $133\%$ of the FPL. But the law included a curious and generous quirk: a mandatory **5% income disregard**. This doesn't mean 5% of your income is ignored. Instead, an amount equal to 5% of the FPL is subtracted from your MAGI before comparing it to the limit.

Let's imagine the FPL for one person is $15,060$. The eligibility limit is $1.33 \times \$15,060 = \$20,039.80$. If an applicant has a MAGI of $\$20,500$, they look to be just over the limit. But first, we apply the disregard: $0.05 \times \$15,060 = \$753$. The applicant's countable income becomes $\$20,500 - \$753 = \$19,747$. Since this is below the $\$20,039.80$ limit, they are eligible! This mechanism effectively raises the income limit for the expansion to $138\%$ of the FPL ($133\% + 5\%$), a small but significant detail that opens the door to more people [@problem_id:4398087] [@problem_id:4380911].

### A Tale of Two States: The Coverage Gap

The Supreme Court's decision to make the Medicaid expansion optional had profound consequences. It created a great natural experiment, splitting the country into states that expanded their programs and states that did not. This leads to what is often called the **"coverage gap."**

Consider two identical adults, both earning an income that is $90\%$ of the FPL—well below the poverty line.
*   In a state that **expanded Medicaid**, this person's income is below the $138\%$ FPL effective threshold. They are eligible for comprehensive Medicaid coverage [@problem_id:4380911].
*   In a state that **did not expand Medicaid**, the old, more restrictive eligibility rules often apply. For a childless adult, the income limit might be zero. At $90\%$ FPL, this person is not poor enough for their state's old Medicaid program. But when they go to the ACA Health Insurance Marketplace to buy a private plan, they discover another problem: the law was written assuming poor people would get Medicaid, so financial assistance for Marketplace plans (premium tax credits) only begins at $100\%$ of the FPL.

This person is trapped. They are too "rich" for their state's Medicaid, but too poor for help on the Marketplace. They are in the coverage gap. This isn't a rare anomaly; it affects millions of people. The legal and policy choices made in state capitols, flowing directly from the constitutional principles of federalism, create vast disparities in health care access that can be quantified and measured [@problem_id:4491482].

### The Question of Belonging

Eligibility isn't just about income. It's also about who is considered part of the community the state has a duty to protect. This involves two other key filters: residency and immigration status.

To be eligible for a state's Medicaid program, you must be a **resident** of that state. This is a common-sense rule based on physical presence and the intent to remain. However, a state cannot penalize you for moving. The Supreme Court has long affirmed a constitutional right to interstate travel, which means states are forbidden from imposing a **durational residency requirement**—for example, forcing you to live there for a year before you can get help. If you move to a new state with the intent to stay, you are a resident on day one [@problem_id:4381009].

Immigration status is a far more complex filter, reflecting decades of federal law.
*   **U.S. citizens** are eligible if they meet other requirements. This includes children born in the United States, whose citizenship is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, regardless of their parents' immigration status [@problem_id:4380932].
*   **"Qualified non-citizens"**—a legal category that includes lawful permanent residents (green card holders)—are generally eligible, but with a major catch. A 1996 law established a mandatory **five-year waiting period** from the time they gain qualified status until they can enroll in Medicaid.
*   **Humanitarian exceptions** exist. Refugees, asylees, and certain other humanitarian immigrants are exempt from the five-year bar and can get coverage immediately.
*   **Undocumented immigrants** are generally ineligible for full-scope Medicaid. The one crucial exception is for life-threatening emergencies. **Emergency Medicaid** will pay doctors and hospitals for the services needed to treat a condition like acute appendicitis or a heart attack, but the coverage ends once the patient is stabilized [@problem_id:4380932].

### Customizing the Program: Amendments and Waivers

This complex machinery is not static. States are constantly tinkering, seeking to adapt the program to their budgets, politics, and the needs of their populations. They have two main tools to propose changes.

For routine adjustments that are already permitted within the federal blueprint, a state submits a **State Plan Amendment (SPA)**. This is like filing a form to let the federal government know you are choosing a pre-approved option. Examples include adding an optional benefit like adult dental care or adopting 12-month continuous eligibility to prevent children from churning on and off of coverage [@problem_id:4380938].

For big, experimental ideas that deviate from federal law, a state must ask for special permission through a **Section 1115 Demonstration Waiver**. This mechanism allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to waive certain rules for a "demonstration project" that is likely to promote the objectives of Medicaid. These waivers are not granted lightly. They are typically time-limited, must be "budget neutral" to the federal government, and require a rigorous evaluation plan. A proposal to add work requirements as a condition of eligibility or to eliminate a mandatory benefit like transportation to medical appointments would require a Section 1115 waiver, as these policies are not authorized under the standard Medicaid blueprint [@problem_id:4380938].

From the high-level constitutional bargain to the on-the-ground reality of a family's immigration status, the principles of Medicaid eligibility are a living embodiment of the intricate, and at times contentious, relationship between federal authority, state autonomy, and our collective vision of a societal safety net.
