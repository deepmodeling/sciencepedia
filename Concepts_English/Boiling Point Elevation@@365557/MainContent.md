## Introduction
The simple act of adding salt to a pot of boiling water is a common kitchen practice, yet it conceals a profound scientific principle known as boiling point elevation. While many know this raises the boiling temperature, the underlying reasons—a fascinating interplay of energy, entropy, and [molecular interactions](@article_id:263273)—are less widely understood. This article demystifies this phenomenon, bridging the gap between everyday observation and the fundamental laws of thermodynamics. In the following sections, we will first explore the principles and mechanisms that explain *why* solutes elevate the boiling point of a solvent. We will then journey through its diverse applications, discovering how this simple [colligative property](@article_id:190958) becomes a powerful tool for chemists to weigh molecules, count ions, and even monitor chemical reactions as they happen.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Have you ever watched a pot of water come to a boil? As the temperature climbs, tiny pockets of steam form and rise, and at a magical temperature—$100\,^{\circ}\text{C}$ at sea level—the whole body of water erupts into a rolling boil. But what happens if you add a pinch of salt or a spoonful of sugar? You might have heard that this changes the boiling point, but have you ever stopped to wonder *why*? This seemingly simple kitchen phenomenon is a window into the deep and elegant principles of thermodynamics, a story about energy, entropy, and the ceaseless dance of molecules.

### A Universe in a Pot of Water: Why Adding Solutes Raises the Boiling Point

Let's imagine ourselves as incredibly tiny observers, swimming among the water molecules. Boiling is an escape act. For a bubble of steam to form and survive, the pressure exerted by the escaping water molecules inside the bubble—what we call the **[vapor pressure](@article_id:135890)**—must be strong enough to push back against the immense weight of the atmosphere pressing down on the water's surface. For pure water at sea level, this balance is struck precisely at $100\,^{\circ}\text{C}$.

Now, let's dissolve a **non-volatile** solute, like sugar, into our pot. "Non-volatile" is a fancy way of saying the sugar itself doesn't want to escape into the vapor. The sugar molecules disperse and mingle with the water molecules. In doing so, they become little anchors. Each solute particle holds onto a few nearby water molecules through intermolecular forces, making it just a little bit harder for those water molecules to make their great escape into the vapor phase. The presence of these solute particles effectively dilutes the water. At any given patch of the surface, there are fewer water molecules available to
