## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Now that we have grappled with the fundamental principles of stereodynamics—the vector correlations and geometric constraints that govern chemical change—you might be wondering, "What is all this for?" It is a fair question. Does knowing the precise three-dimensional choreography of a single molecular event have any bearing on the world we see and interact with? The answer, you may not be surprised to hear, is a resounding yes. The beauty of these principles is not confined to the rarefied air of a [chemical physics](@article_id:199091) laboratory; it echoes in the mechanisms of life and the properties of the materials we build.
