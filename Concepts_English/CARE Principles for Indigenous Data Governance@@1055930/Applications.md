## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Having journeyed through the foundational principles of CARE—Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics—we might be tempted to see them as a set of beautiful but abstract ideals. A moral compass, perhaps, but how do we build a real, working ship with it? It turns out that these principles are not just philosophical guides; they are powerful, practical tools for engineering a new kind of science. They provide the blueprints for creating research ecosystems that are not only more just and equitable but also more robust and trustworthy. In this chapter, we will leave the shore of theory and sail into the ocean of practice, exploring how the CARE principles are being applied to solve real-world problems across a remarkable range of disciplines.

### Re-engineering the Engine Room of Modern Medicine: Genomics and Biobanking

Perhaps nowhere is the need for this new engineering more apparent than in the world of genomics. The promise of genomic medicine—personalized treatments, early disease prediction, understanding the very code of life—is immense. But this promise is built on a foundation of data, vast oceans of it, often collected and stored in large-scale biobanks. And here, the old ways of doing things begin to show their cracks.

Imagine a national biobank launching a major study. It plans to collect whole-genome sequences and health records from thousands of people, including a significant cohort from a sovereign Indigenous Nation. The plan seems sound by conventional standards: the data will be "de-identified," an Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the biobank’s university will oversee the research, and any profits from commercialization will go into a general public health fund. The Nation is even invited to have a representative on an advisory board. What could be wrong?

When we hold this plan up to the light of the CARE principles, we see that it is riddled with weaknesses. The advisory board has no real power; its recommendations are non-binding. This is consultation, not the **Authority to Control** that Indigenous data sovereignty demands. The "de-identification" offers weak protection for a genetically distinct group, failing to prevent group-level harms. And the benefits, funneled into a general fund, may never find their way back to the community whose data created the value in the first place, violating the principle of **Collective Benefit** [@problem_id:4863892].

This common scenario reveals that traditional ethical frameworks, focused on individual consent and institutional oversight, are simply not enough. So, how do we build a better biobank? The CARE principles provide the design specifications.

First, we must operationalize **Authority to Control**. This means moving beyond token advisory roles to establish genuine co-governance. A powerful mechanism for this is a Data Access Committee with majority representation from the Indigenous community, holding binding veto power over how data is used, by whom, and for what purpose [@problem_id:4370895]. This principle must also extend to the very bedrock of research consent. The common practice of "broad consent"—where an individual gives a one-time permission for all future, unspecified research—is fundamentally incompatible with ongoing community authority. A CARE-aligned approach replaces this with a tiered, dual-consent framework. It requires not only dynamic consent from individuals but also, critically, collective authorization from the community's governing body for any new uses of the data or the biological samples from which it came, especially in groundbreaking fields like CRISPR gene editing [@problem_id:4742731].

Second, **Collective Benefit** must be woven into the fabric of the research from the start. This means creating enforceable benefit-sharing plans, co-designed with the community, that direct tangible value back to them. This can take many forms: revenue-sharing from commercialized products, funding for local health infrastructure and data science training programs, or ensuring the research addresses the community's own health priorities [@problem_id:4421114] [@problem_id:4423313]. We can even devise sophisticated systems, inspired by cooperative game theory, to measure the marginal contribution of each community's data to a predictive model's success and allocate benefits accordingly, ensuring that those whose data are most critical are rewarded fairly, while also protecting smaller communities with equity-based floors [@problem_id:4423311].

Finally, these principles must be made real through technology and law. In the age of artificial intelligence, we can use cutting-edge techniques to uphold CARE. For instance, [federated learning](@entry_id:637118) allows AI models to be trained without the raw genomic data ever leaving the community's sovereign control—we send the algorithm to the data, not the other way around. We can use formal privacy methods, like [differential privacy](@entry_id:261539), to provide a mathematical guarantee on privacy loss, expressed as a [privacy budget](@entry_id:276909), $\epsilon$, which can be managed by the community. We can build AI models with measurable fairness constraints to ensure they don't perform worse for the very people whose data helped build them. These technical tools can be embedded within robust legal structures like an Indigenous-managed Data Trust, a legal entity that acts as a sovereign steward for the community's data, enforcing the rules of access, benefit, and use [@problem_id:4423313].

### The Sound of Sovereignty: CARE Across the Sciences

The power of the CARE principles is that they are not confined to a single discipline. They apply whenever research intersects with Indigenous peoples, their lands, and their knowledge. Let us take a journey from the genomics lab into the great outdoors, into the field of [soundscape ecology](@entry_id:191534).

Imagine a team of ecologists wants to study [biodiversity](@entry_id:139919) by deploying a network of autonomous audio recorders across an Indigenous Nation's territory. A fantastic scientific goal! But there is a risk: these microphones, listening 24/7, might inadvertently record private human conversations or culturally sensitive activities. How can the research proceed without violating the community's privacy and authority?

Here again, CARE provides a multi-layered solution. It's a beautiful example of combining social, technical, and governance approaches. First, through co-design with the community (**Responsibility**), researchers can map and geofence sacred sites or residential areas, strategically placing recorders to dramatically lower the probability of capturing human speech. Second, they can use on-device AI to detect and delete human speech in real-time, a technical safeguard for privacy. Third, they can program the recorders to operate on a "duty cycle," recording intermittently rather than continuously, further reducing exposure.

A thought experiment shows the power of this combined approach. If a baseline plan had an [expected risk](@entry_id:634700) of capturing over 1,000 hours of conversation, a layered strategy of geofencing, duty-cycling, and on-device deletion could reduce that risk to less than 10 hours—a 99% reduction in harm—while still collecting vast amounts of valuable ecological data.

Most importantly, these technical measures operate within a governance framework of **Authority to Control**. The community, through an Indigenous-led data access committee, holds the ultimate veto power. The data is stored on community-controlled servers, and access is granted through purpose-limited licenses, ensuring the data is used respectfully and only for approved projects [@problem_id:2533899]. This shows how CARE principles enable science that is both ethically sound and methodologically innovative, far beyond the confines of medicine.

### The Structural Embodiment of CARE: From Contracts to Institutions

Principles are only as strong as the structures that uphold them. For CARE to have teeth, it must be embedded in the formal architecture of research—in its legal agreements and its governing institutions.

In law, property is often described as a "bundle of rights"—the right to own, to control, to access, to possess. For too long, research has acted as if this bundle dissolves the moment a biological sample is given. The CARE principles, often working alongside the OCAP® (Ownership, Control, Access, and Possession) principles, insist on rebuilding this bundle through binding legal agreements. A truly equitable research collaboration is memorialized not in a loose memorandum of understanding, but in a formal Material and Data Transfer Agreement. This contract explicitly recognizes the Indigenous Nation as the owner and steward of its data and specimens, and the university as a time-limited, purpose-limited user. It codifies the community's veto authority, its right to withdraw, its co-ownership of intellectual property, and its share in any benefits. The principles become enforceable rights [@problem_id:4501878].

The ultimate expression of research sovereignty is the establishment of an Indigenous IRB. A university IRB is essential, but its focus is primarily on protecting individuals from biomedical risk. It is not equipped to evaluate collective harms, to prevent the misrepresentation of a people, or to guard against what is known as "epistemic extraction"—the removal of knowledge from a community without reciprocal benefit, leaving the community poorer for it. An Indigenous IRB, governed by the Nation itself, extends the scope of ethical review to include these crucial dimensions. It asks not only "Is this research safe for the individual?" but also "Is this research good for our people? Does it respect our sovereignty? Does it align with our priorities?" It is the institutional embodiment of CARE, ensuring that research is conducted *with* and *by* Indigenous peoples, not merely *on* them [@problem_id:4986458].

### Towards a Reparative Science

Why is all this necessary? Why the deep-seated distrust that makes such frameworks essential? To understand this, we must look to history. In many parts of the world, the story of science is inseparable from the history of colonialism. It is a history marred by "epistemic injustice"—a harm done to someone in their capacity as a knower.

This can take the form of **testimonial injustice**, where a person's knowledge is dismissed because of who they are. When foreign experts design a major public health intervention, like the release of gene-drive mosquitoes to fight malaria, without valuing the local ecological expertise of the community who has lived on that land for millennia, they are committing testimonial injustice. It also takes the form of **hermeneutical injustice**, a structural problem where a community lacks the shared language to make their concerns understood by the powerful. If a community’s deep-seated concerns about kinship or spiritual balance are dismissed because they cannot be expressed in the narrow, technocratic language of a risk assessment, they are suffering from hermeneutical injustice [@problem_id:4742750].

Seen in this light, the CARE principles are more than just a modern ethical framework. They are a toolkit for reparative justice. They are about actively repairing the broken trust and building a new kind of relationship between science and society. Co-designing research protocols, ensuring multilingual deliberation, sharing governance of data and IP, and respecting community authority are not just "best practices"; they are acts of repair.

The beauty of science lies in its relentless quest for understanding. The CARE principles challenge us to see that this quest is incomplete if it is not also a quest for justice. They show us that the most elegant, powerful, and enduring science is that which respects the dignity and sovereignty of all peoples, building a future where knowledge enriches everyone, starting with those from whom it is learned.
