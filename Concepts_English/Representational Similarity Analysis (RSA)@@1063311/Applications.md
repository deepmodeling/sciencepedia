## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Having understood the principles of Representational Similarity Analysis—this wonderfully intuitive idea of characterizing a complex system by the geometry of its internal states—we can now ask the most exciting question: What can we do with it? What new worlds does this "geometric camera" allow us to see? The answer, it turns out, is that we have found a remarkably versatile key, capable of unlocking insights not just in neuroscience, but in fields as disparate as artificial intelligence, psychology, and even [material science](@entry_id:152226). RSA gives us a common language to talk about the structure of information, wherever it may be found.

### Mapping the Mind's Atlas

Perhaps the most direct application of RSA is in charting the functional territories of the brain. We have long known that different brain regions do different things, but *how* do they represent the world? If we place a region of interest, say, in the visual cortex, under the "microscope" of RSA, we can begin to answer that question. By showing a person many different images—cats, cars, faces, houses—and measuring the brain's activity patterns with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), we can construct a neural Representational Dissimilarity Matrix (RDM). This RDM is like a personalized distance chart for the concepts inside that specific brain area.

We can then propose a hypothesis in the form of a model RDM. For example, a simple model might state that all animal images are "close" to each other and "far" from all vehicle images. By comparing the brain's RDM with our model RDM, we can ask: Does this brain region organize the world according to our hypothesized categories? [@problem_id:4190826]. This allows us to move beyond simply saying a region "activates" and start describing the *content* and *structure* of the information it processes.

This approach comes with its own methodological choices, each akin to selecting a different lens. We can use a "wide-angle" approach by averaging across a large, anatomically defined Region of Interest (ROI). This gives us great statistical power but a coarse spatial view. Alternatively, we can use a "macro lens"—a technique called searchlight RSA—that moves a small sphere of analysis from point to point across the entire brain. This sacrifices some power but gives us a beautifully fine-grained map, pinpointing small, specific neighborhoods of neurons that might harbor a particular representational geometry [@problem_id:4147100]. The choice is a classic trade-off between power and precision, allowing us to tailor our investigation to the question at hand.

### The Brain and the Machine: A Dialogue in Geometry

For decades, we have been building machines that can see. Artificial intelligence, in the form of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can now classify images with superhuman accuracy. But a profound question lingers: Does the AI *see* the world in the same way we do? Is its internal "understanding" of a cat anything like our own?

RSA provides a revolutionary way to address this. We can treat a layer of a CNN just like a brain region. We show it the same set of images we showed our human subjects and record the activation patterns of its artificial neurons. From this, we construct a CNN-layer RDM. Now, we have two geometric maps for the same set of images: one from the brain, one from the machine.

The comparison of these two RDMs, often called second-order RSA, is the heart of the dialogue [@problem_id:4015322]. We can take the dissimilarity values from each map and see how well they correlate. A high correlation tells us that the AI layer and the brain region organize the world in a strikingly similar way—that images the brain considers similar, the AI also considers similar. Researchers have used this very technique to discover that the hierarchical layers of a CNN map astonishingly well onto the hierarchical stages of the primate ventral visual stream, suggesting that our best AI models may have independently discovered some of the same fundamental principles for vision that evolution engineered in our brains [@problem_id:3974008].

### Capturing Thought in Motion

The brain is not a static object; it is a dynamic, living system. Its representations are constantly changing, whether over the course of a lifetime or in the span of a single thought. RSA, when cleverly applied, can capture these dynamics.

Imagine you are learning to distinguish different types of birds. At first, all small brown birds might look the same. After weeks of practice, you can effortlessly tell a sparrow from a finch. RSA can track this learning process. By measuring representations in the brain's inferotemporal cortex before and after training, we can observe the geometric consequences of learning. The neural patterns for sparrows, once scattered, cluster together. The patterns for finches do the same. The distance *between* the sparrow and finch clusters might even increase. RSA allows us to watch, in the abstract space of neural codes, as the brain chisels away at its representations to better reflect the learned structure of the world [@problem_id:4466370].

But what about faster processes? The brain operates on the scale of milliseconds. With techniques like Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG), which measure neural activity with exquisite temporal precision, we can perform time-resolved RSA. This is like making a movie of the representational geometry. We can present an image and compute an RDM for each millisecond that follows. In this "movie," we can watch a coherent representation crystallize out of the initial noisy brain activity. We might first see a geometry that reflects low-level features like lines and edges, which, a hundred milliseconds later, transforms into a geometry that neatly separates faces from objects. This gives us an unprecedented window into the temporal unfolding of perception and cognition [@problem_id:4190833].

### Testing the Grand Theories of Cognition

Beyond mapping and tracking, RSA can serve as a powerful arbiter between competing psychological and cognitive theories. Many theories make implicit or explicit claims about how information should be structured in the mind. RSA allows us to translate these theoretical claims into concrete, testable geometric predictions.

A classic example is the Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) theory of memory. This theory posits that we have two interacting memory systems: the [hippocampus](@entry_id:152369), which learns specific episodes rapidly, and the neocortex, which slowly learns generalities by extracting statistical regularities. The theory predicts that immediately after learning about new items from different categories, the hippocampus should represent each item as unique and distinct (a process called [pattern separation](@entry_id:199607)), while the neocortex will not yet show much structure. After a period of consolidation (like a night's sleep), the theory predicts the neocortex will have extracted the categories, and its representational geometry will now reflect this new, generalized knowledge.

RSA provides the perfect tool to test this. By creating a model RDM for item-specific representations and another for categorical representations, we can measure which geometry best fits the [hippocampus](@entry_id:152369) and the neocortex, and how this changes over time. Studies have done just this, finding evidence that aligns beautifully with the CLS predictions, thereby giving a highly abstract cognitive theory a concrete grounding in the brain's neural dynamics [@problem_id:3970389].

### Probing the Frontiers of Consciousness

Perhaps the most tantalizing application of RSA is in the study of consciousness, one of the last great mysteries of science. How does subjective experience arise from the brain's machinery? While this question remains unsolved, RSA can help us find the neural correlates of consciousness—the patterns of activity that distinguish conscious from unconscious thought.

Consider an experiment where an image is flashed so briefly that a subject is sometimes aware of it and sometimes not. We can use RSA to ask: does the brain's representational geometry change depending on whether the stimulus enters conscious awareness? Researchers can test whether a clear categorical structure—for example, the separation of "faces" from "tools"—only "snaps" into place in the brain's high-level visual areas on trials where the subject reports consciously seeing the image [@problem_id:4501045]. This provides a potential geometric signature of a conscious representation.

We can push this even further, into the very nature of our internal, subjective worlds. When you perceive a face, imagine a face, or even dream of a face, are these experiences supported by a common neural code? Is the "face space" in your brain—the geometric arrangement of neural patterns for different faces—the same across these different states of consciousness? By comparing the RDMs from perception, imagery, and even from brain activity during REM sleep (decoded via dream reports), we can begin to answer this profound question. RSA allows us to quantitatively test the hypothesis that these different conscious states are just different ways of activating the same underlying representational map [@problem_id:4501119].

### Beyond the Brain: A Universal Tool for Comparing Structures

The true beauty of a powerful abstract tool is its universality. RSA is not just a tool for neuroscience; it is a tool for understanding the structure of information in any complex system. Let's step away from biology and into the world of materials science and artificial intelligence.

Scientists are now using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a type of AI, to predict the properties of new, undiscovered materials for applications like better batteries. A GNN, like the brain, has layers of processing. We can use RSA to understand how this network "thinks" about materials. By treating the materials as "stimuli" and the GNN layers as "brain regions," we can construct RDMs. One RDM can be built from a target physical property, like a material's diffusion barrier. Other RDMs can be built from the activation patterns within each layer of the GNN.

By comparing these RDMs, a scientist can see how well the network's internal geometric representation of the materials aligns with the geometry of the physical property they want to predict. This allows them to diagnose the model. For instance, they can see which layers have learned the most relevant information and decide whether a layer's pre-trained knowledge is useful for a new problem or if it needs to be fine-tuned. This application of RSA, far from the world of neurons and consciousness, shows the method's fundamental power: it is a general-purpose framework for comparing the structure of information across different domains, be they biological or artificial [@problem_id:3917820].

From charting the brain to watching learning happen, from testing cognitive theories to peering into the nature of consciousness and even designing new materials, RSA provides a unifying perspective. By abstracting complex, high-dimensional data into a simple, intuitive geometric picture, it gives us a language to compare apples and oranges—brains and computers, perception and dreams, biology and physics—and in doing so, reveals a little more of the deep, structural unity of the world.
