## Introduction
How can a modern government effectively regulate complex fields like public health, environmental safety, and medicine? Congress cannot micromanage every detail, leading to the creation of expert agencies like the FDA and EPA to fill in the gaps. This delegation of power, however, raises a fundamental constitutional question: who ensures these agencies don't overstep their authority? This article addresses the critical role of the judiciary in overseeing the administrative state by examining the legal frameworks that have governed this relationship for decades. The following chapters will guide you through this complex legal landscape. First, "Principles and Mechanisms" will unpack the core doctrines of judicial review, from the rise of *Chevron* deference to its recent curtailment by the major questions doctrine. Then, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" will illustrate how these abstract principles are applied in high-stakes, real-world contexts, shaping everything from prescription drug warnings to national healthcare policy.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Imagine trying to run a country of over 300 million people using only the laws written directly by a few hundred members of Congress. It’s an impossible task. Congress can’t possibly specify the exact, safe level of mercury in fish, the precise safety standards for every nut and bolt in an airplane, or the criteria for what constitutes a “medically necessary” procedure for every conceivable illness. To build a modern society, the architects—Congress—must be able to delegate the detailed engineering work to specialists. This simple necessity is the wellspring of the entire administrative state, a sprawling landscape of agencies like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

But this raises a profound constitutional puzzle. The U.S. Constitution neatly separates powers: Congress makes the laws, the President executes them, and the Judiciary interprets them. If Congress gives an agency the power to write detailed rules that have the force of law, isn't it giving away its legislative power? This is the central question behind the **nondelegation doctrine**. For nearly a century, the courts have resolved this tension with a remarkably flexible solution: the **intelligible principle** test. So long as Congress provides an “intelligible principle” to guide the agency—a goal, a set of factors to consider, and some boundaries—the delegation is constitutionally sound. This principle can be as broad as protecting public health or ensuring that medical devices are “reasonably safe and effective.” In practice, this has meant that Congress has immense latitude to empower agencies to fill in the vast details of governance.

### The Agency's Toolkit: From Binding Rules to Gentle Guidance

Once an agency is given a mission, it has a diverse toolkit for carrying it out. Understanding these tools is the first step to understanding how they are reviewed by the courts. Agency actions generally fall into three categories, each with a different legal weight.

First is **notice-and-comment rulemaking**. This is the agency’s heavy artillery. When an agency wants to create a **legislative rule**—a regulation that has the same binding force as a law passed by Congress—it must announce its proposal, invite public feedback (the "notice and comment" period), and then issue a final rule that considers that feedback. This process is designed to be transparent and democratic, and the resulting regulations are the most powerful tool an agency has.

Second is **adjudication**. This is the agency acting like a court, resolving specific disputes involving particular parties. For example, an Administrative Law Judge might decide whether a specific hospital's appeal for a denied Medicare claim is valid. While these decisions resolve individual cases, they can also create precedents that articulate the agency’s policy on a broader issue.

Third are **interpretive rules and guidance documents**. These are the manuals, circulars, warning letters, and frequently asked questions that agencies produce in immense quantities. Unlike legislative rules, they do not have the force of law. Their stated purpose is merely to *interpret* or *clarify* existing statutes and regulations. They are not subject to the lengthy notice-and-comment process, making them a fast and flexible way for an agency to communicate its thinking. But as we will see, the line between "interpreting" a rule and "creating" a new one can be vanishingly thin.

### The Judge's Dilemma: The Era of *Chevron* Deference

Now, imagine a hospital challenges a new CMS regulation. The hospital argues the rule goes against the Medicare statute; CMS argues it's a perfectly valid interpretation. The statutory language is fuzzy, open to multiple readings. What is a judge to do? Should the judge, a generalist in law, substitute their own reading of a complex healthcare statute for that of the expert agency charged by Congress with administering it?

For decades, this was a messy, unpredictable affair. Then, in 1984, a landmark Supreme Court case, *Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council*, established a simple and powerful framework that would govern administrative law for a generation. It was, in essence, a peace treaty between the judiciary and the executive branch, built on a principle of judicial humility. The **Chevron deference** framework created a two-step dance for courts to follow.

**Step One: Has Congress spoken directly to the precise question at issue?** Using all the traditional tools of legal interpretation—text, structure, history—the court first asks if the statute’s meaning is clear. If Congress’s intent is unambiguous, that’s the end of the story. The court (and the agency) must follow that clear command.

**Step Two: If the statute is silent or ambiguous, is the agency’s interpretation a permissible construction of the statute?** If the law is fuzzy, the court does not impose its own interpretation. Instead, it asks only if the agency’s choice is *reasonable*. It doesn’t have to be the best interpretation, or the one the court would have picked. So long as it’s a valid, rational choice within the bounds of the statute, the court must defer to the agency.

The logic of *Chevron* was elegant. It recognized that agencies have specialized expertise that courts lack. More importantly, it recognized that resolving ambiguity in a law often involves making policy choices. In a democracy, such policy choices should be made by the executive branch, which is politically accountable to the people through the President, not by unelected federal judges.

Of course, this powerful deference wasn't given to every agency utterance. The Supreme Court later clarified that *Chevron*’s two-step only applies to agency actions that carry the “force of law”—primarily legislative rules from notice-and-comment rulemaking and formal adjudications.

### The Softer Touch: The Power to Persuade

What about all the other agency actions, like the vast libraries of manuals and guidance documents? For these, a different, much older standard applies: **Skidmore deference**. Under *Skidmore*, an agency’s interpretation is not entitled to controlling weight, but it is respected based on its “power to persuade.” A court will consider factors like the thoroughness of the agency's reasoning, the consistency of its position over time, and its specialized expertise.

For instance, an FDA view on the preemptive scope of a federal statute, even if published in a formal preamble, is a legal conclusion that falls outside the agency’s core scientific expertise. A court would not give it *Chevron* deference but might consider its persuasive value under *Skidmore*. Similarly, a court might find a 15-year-old, consistently applied interpretation in a CMS manual highly persuasive, even if it is not legally binding. This framework ensures that the vast output of agency guidance is not ignored, but it firmly leaves the ultimate interpretive authority with the court.

A similar logic has come to govern how courts review an agency's interpretation of its *own* regulations (a doctrine known as **Auer deference**). Recent decisions have tightened this standard, clarifying that courts should only defer to an agency's reading of its own rule if the rule is genuinely ambiguous and the interpretation reflects the agency's fair and considered judgment, not a convenient new position that creates "unfair surprise" for regulated parties.

### The New Era: The Rise of Major Questions

The era of *Chevron*'s dominance has been waning. Critics began to argue that the doctrine gave agencies too much power, allowing them to enact transformative policies based on flimsy or ambiguous statutory language, effectively usurping Congress's lawmaking role. This critique has culminated in the rise of a powerful new judicial tool: the **major questions doctrine**.

Think of it this way: if you ask an employee to “manage the office efficiently,” you probably haven’t authorized them to sell the headquarters and move the company to another country. The major questions doctrine applies this same common sense to statutes. It holds that in "extraordinary cases"—when an agency claims the power to make a decision of vast economic and political significance—a vague or general grant of authority is not enough. For such momentous policies, Congress itself must have spoken clearly and authorized the specific action. The court will not find such a massive delegation of power hidden in the nooks and crannies of a statute.

The application of this doctrine is beautifully illustrated by two real-world cases that inspired legal analysis. When a federal agency used a general workplace safety law to impose a vaccine-or-test mandate on virtually every private employer in the country, the Supreme Court struck it down. This was a major question, a sweeping public health measure far outside the agency's normal domain, and Congress had not clearly authorized it. In contrast, when CMS required staff vaccination in hospitals that receive Medicare funds, the Court upheld the rule. This was not an economy-wide mandate; it was a targeted condition tied to federal funding within CMS's core mission of protecting patient health and safety.

The major questions doctrine, along with a broader judicial trend of reasserting the courts' own authority to interpret law, has effectively curtailed the *Chevron* framework. The pendulum has swung back. The default is no longer to ask if an agency's interpretation is reasonable. The default is for the judge to apply the traditional tools of statutory interpretation and decide what the law means. The agency’s expert opinion is still a valuable and persuasive input, but it is no longer the final word. The peace treaty has been revised, and the balance of power in the administrative state is being redrawn before our eyes.
