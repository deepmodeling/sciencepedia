## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Having journeyed through the principles and mechanisms of decolonizing global health, we now arrive at a crucial question: What does it look like in practice? How does this powerful critique move from the pages of academic journals into the boardrooms of NGOs, the design of research studies, and the halls of universities? This is not merely an intellectual exercise; it is a practical blueprint for reimagining how we work together to achieve health for all. We will see that the principles of redistributing power, sharing resources, and centering local knowledge are not abstract ideals but concrete, measurable actions that are reshaping our world.

### Re-engineering the Machinery of Global Health

At its heart, decolonizing global health is about changing the very machinery of how aid, policy, and health programs are run. It asks us to look past the mission statements and follow the power and the money.

Imagine an international NGO with a multi-million dollar budget, publicly committed to "decolonizing" its work. What does that actually mean? Does it mean hiring more local staff? Does it mean putting photos of smiling local partners on its annual report? A decolonizing approach says no—these are surface-level changes. The real transformation is structural and can be measured. We must ask: who truly controls the resources and who holds decision-making power?

A genuinely decolonized program would transfer a significant majority of its budget, not as sub-grants with strings attached, but as prime awards to locally registered organizations, giving them the legal and financial authority to lead. It would redesign its governance so that local actors—from community organizations to the Ministry of Health—hold a majority of voting seats ($s_L/s \ge 0.5$) on the steering committee, with the authority to make binding financial and strategic decisions. It would shift its procurement to local suppliers and equalize the overhead rates it offers local partners, dismantling the fiction that international organizations inherently deserve a larger cut. It would establish ironclad data ownership with local institutions and create accountability mechanisms with real teeth, ensuring that if these power-shifting targets are missed, there are consequences [@problem_id:4552767]. This is the difference between partnership as rhetoric and partnership as reality.

This logic scales up from individual NGOs to the giants of the global health stage—multilateral organizations like the World Health Organization and the World Bank. For decades, reform efforts have centered on concepts like "localization" (shifting implementation to local actors) and "country ownership" (getting a national government’s signature on a plan). While not without merit, decolonization argues that these concepts often fall short. You can "localize" a project by contracting a local organization to execute a plan designed in Geneva or Washington, D.C. You can achieve "country ownership" when a government formally accepts a project whose priorities and funding streams are still controlled by foreign donors.

Decolonization is a more profound and fundamental shift. It is not about changing who implements the plan, but about transforming who writes the plan in the first place. It seeks to reform the governance of multilateral organizations to elevate representation from the Global South and reduce the influence of donor-earmarked funding that dictates priorities. It is the difference between being a guest in your own house and holding the deed [@problem_id:5005662]. This principle even applies to emerging models like South-South and triangular cooperation, which must be intentionally designed to prevent the replication of old hierarchies, ensuring that Northern partners act as facilitators, not directors, and that governance, budgets, and data are controlled by the collaborating Southern partners [@problem_id:4997364].

### The Quest for Knowledge: Decolonizing Research and Education

Nowhere are colonial legacies more deeply embedded than in the production of knowledge. For centuries, the model of "discovery" was often one of extraction—of resources, of artifacts, and of data. In science, this has manifested as "parachute research," where scientists from high-income countries fly into a community, collect samples and data, and fly out to publish in prestigious journals, with little to no involvement, credit, or tangible benefit for the community that made the research possible.

A decolonized approach to research dismantles this extractive model piece by piece. It begins by reframing the relationship from one between "researcher" and "subject" to one of genuine partnership. This is operationalized through concrete mechanisms that redistribute power. Instead of a superficial "Community Advisory Board," a decolonized study establishes a co-governance structure where community representatives sit on the steering committee with equal decision-making authority, including the power to veto changes that are not in the community's interest ($v=1$) [@problem_id:4858075].

Perhaps the most critical shift is toward **data sovereignty**. In the old model, data was an extractive resource. In a decolonized model, data generated by a community is owned by that community. This means primary data is stored locally, under local law ($d_J=L$), and governed by data-sharing agreements co-designed with the community. This gives communities the authority to control who can access their data and for what purpose, turning data from an extracted commodity into a community-governed asset [@problem_id:5003032].

This philosophy extends to the fruits of research. Justice demands fair benefit-sharing. As the history of the early contraceptive trials in Puerto Rico grimly reminds us, it is a profound injustice for a community to bear the risks of research without guaranteed access to its benefits. A decolonized trial, therefore, moves beyond simply publishing results. It involves negotiating intellectual property rights from the outset, planning for technology transfer to local manufacturers, and, crucially, making a legally binding commitment to ensure that the intervention, if proven effective, will be accessible and affordable to the participant community long after the study ends [@problem_id:4766495].

This revolutionary spirit must also enter the classroom. For too long, health education has been dominated by a single, biomedical worldview, often presented as universal truth. Many institutions have tried to address this by adding "cultural competency" modules—short courses designed to teach providers about the beliefs and behaviors of "other" cultures. While well-intentioned, this approach treats culture as a set of exotic facts to be memorized about a patient.

A decolonized curriculum goes much deeper. It is not an add-on; it is a system-wide reform. It interrogates the historical and political foundations of health science itself. It challenges the "epistemic stance" of the institution by centering other knowledge systems—such as Indigenous health paradigms—as co-equal and valid ways of understanding the world. Its scope is not just the individual student's attitudes but the institution's policies, partnerships, and power structures, with success measured not by a multiple-choice test but by the university's accountability to the communities it claims to serve [@problem_id:4986394].

One might wonder: does this turn against science? Does respecting other knowledge systems mean abandoning the rigor of empirical evaluation? The answer is a resounding no. In fact, it can lead to a more creative, robust, and beautiful science.

Consider the challenge of evaluating a traditional plant-based remedy used by Indigenous healers. A colonial approach might test a lab-purified extract in a sterile trial, stripping the remedy of its ritual context and dismissing local understandings of illness as "unscientific." A decolonized approach, co-designed with healers and community leaders, can do something far more interesting. It can use the gold standard of a randomized trial, but in a way that respects local reality. For instance, one could use a **cluster-randomized design**, where entire healer practices are the unit of randomization, allowing the remedy to be administered as it always is, including its vital ritual components. The study could be designed with two co-primary outcomes: a biomedical one, like fever-days, and an Indigenous one, like a co-developed scale measuring "restored balance." Such a study doesn't reject science; it expands it, creating a richer, more holistic, and more truthful picture of healing by [braiding](@entry_id:138715) together different ways of knowing [@problem_id:4741648]. This is the ultimate application: a science that is not only effective but also just.

In every sphere—from the NGO to the university to the clinical trial—decolonizing global health offers a new scorecard for progress. It suggests that we must measure not only *if* we are saving lives, but *how*. It compels us to track the metrics of justice: the proportion of the budget controlled by local partners ($p_b$), the share of decision-making votes they hold ($p_d$), the percentage of publications on which they are lead authors ($p_a$), and the degree to which they own and control their own data ($s_d$) [@problem_id:4994132]. By making these the measures of success, we transform global health from an act of charity into an act of solidarity and a pursuit of justice.
