## Introduction
Managing a patient's home medications around the time of surgery is a cornerstone of safe perioperative care. This complex process involves more than just following a simple checklist; it demands a deep understanding of how a patient's chronic therapies interact with the unique physiological stresses of anesthesia and surgery. The central challenge is balancing the risk of discontinuing essential medications against the risk of drug-related complications during a procedure. This article bridges that knowledge gap by providing a framework for evidence-based decision-making. In the following chapters, you will first explore the fundamental "Principles and Mechanisms" that govern key drug classes like RAAS blockers, blood thinners, and psychotropic agents. Subsequently, the "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" chapter will demonstrate how these principles are applied in diverse clinical scenarios, from managing a patient with diabetes to preparing a patient with Parkinson's disease, illustrating the art and science of personalized perioperative medicine.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Embarking on surgery is like navigating a ship through a carefully controlled storm. The surgeon is the captain, and the anesthesiologist is the navigator, skillfully guiding the patient's body through the tumultuous waters of anesthesia and the surgical procedure itself. Our task in perioperative medication management is to ensure the ship is seaworthy before it ever leaves the harbor. We must decide which parts of its normal operating equipment to keep running, which to temporarily shut down, and which to reinforce. This isn't a task for rigid checklists; it's a profound exercise in applied physiology and pharmacology, a detective story where every clue lies within the patient's unique biology and the fundamental nature of the drugs they take.

The core challenge is a beautiful balancing act. On one side of the tightrope is the patient's normal life, with chronic conditions like hypertension, diabetes, or heart disease managed by a delicate symphony of medications. On the other side is the temporary, artificial state of surgery, where the body’s normal rules are suspended. Anesthesia intentionally causes vasodilation, widening blood vessels and lowering blood pressure. The stress of surgery can provoke inflammation and clotting. Our decisions must navigate the tension between these two worlds: the risk of the surgery itself versus the risk of the patient's underlying diseases if their medications are stopped. Just as we avoid "routine" lab tests that won't change our plan, we must avoid "routine" medication instructions. Every decision to hold or continue a drug must be a conscious one, reasoned from first principles [@problem_id:4659799].

### The Body Under Anesthesia: A Controlled Disruption

To understand why we manage medications as we do, we must first appreciate the strange and wonderful world of the anesthetized body. General anesthesia is far more than just deep sleep; it is a reversible, medically induced coma. A key effect is the depression of the central nervous system, which blunts the body's autonomic "autopilot" systems that normally keep blood pressure stable. The blood vessels relax and widen, and the heart's immediate reflexes are slowed.

To counteract the resulting drop in blood pressure, the body relies on its powerful backup generators. A chief among these is the **Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS)**. When the kidneys sense low pressure, they release renin, kicking off a cascade that produces a hormone called angiotensin II. This molecule is a potent vasoconstrictor, squeezing blood vessels to raise pressure back to a safe level. This physiological tug-of-war between the pressure-lowering effects of anesthesia and the pressure-raising effects of the RAAS is the backdrop for one of the most common and nuanced decisions in perioperative medicine.

### The Great Debate: RAAS Blockers and Blood Pressure

Many millions of people take medications called **Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors** (like lisinopril) or **Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs)** to treat high blood pressure. Their entire job is to block the RAAS. Now, you can see the conflict. What happens when a patient taking a drug that disables the body's main blood pressure backup system undergoes anesthesia, which is actively trying to lower blood pressure? The result can be profound, refractory hypotension—a drop in blood pressure that is difficult to treat with standard medications [@problem_id:4958535].

For a patient whose only issue is hypertension, the logic is straightforward. The risk of one missed dose of their medication is a slight, temporary rise in blood pressure, which is easily managed. This is far less dangerous than the risk of a precipitous blood pressure crash during surgery. Therefore, the standard, logical practice is to **hold** the morning dose of an ACE inhibitor or ARB on the day of surgery [@problem_id:4883472].

But here, a beautiful exception reveals the elegance of physiological reasoning. Consider a different patient, one with **Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)** [@problem_id:5092859]. In this condition, the heart muscle is weak and struggles to pump blood against the pressure in the arteries (a property known as afterload). For this patient, the ACE inhibitor is not just a blood pressure pill; it is a fundamental therapy. By blocking the RAAS and lowering afterload, the drug makes it easier for the failing heart to do its job, thereby maintaining the patient's cardiac output. For this patient, stopping the medication could increase the strain on their weak heart, potentially tipping them into acute heart failure.

So, what do we do? We prioritize the heart. We **continue** the medication, even though we know it increases the risk of hypotension. We trade one risk for another, lesser one. We communicate this to the anesthesiologist, who will be prepared to manage the predictable low blood pressure with specific vasopressors. This decision shows that we never treat a drug in isolation; we treat the specific physiology of the patient for whom the drug is prescribed. The *indication* is everything [@problem_id:5092859] [@problem_id:4883472].

### To Bleed or To Clot: The Saga of Blood Thinners

Hemostasis, the process of forming a blood clot, is like building a dam to stop a leak. First, platelets (the "bricks") rush to the site of injury to form a temporary plug. Then, the [coagulation cascade](@entry_id:154501), a complex chain reaction of proteins, generates a mesh of fibrin (the "mortar") to create a strong, stable clot. "Blood thinners" work by interfering with one of these two processes.

**Antiplatelets: Taming the Bricks**

Medications like **aspirin** and **clopidogrel** work on the platelets. Aspirin, for example, irreversibly poisons an enzyme called **cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1)**, which is essential for platelets to become sticky and aggregate [@problem_id:4660041]. Because the inhibition is irreversible, the effect lasts for the entire lifespan of the platelet, about 7 to 10 days. This is a critical point.

The conflict is obvious: for a patient with a coronary stent, these drugs are life-saving, preventing a catastrophic clot from forming inside the stent. But during surgery, they can turn a minor bleed into a major one. Consider a patient with a drug-eluting stent placed 8 months prior who needs their gallbladder removed [@problem_id:4958535]. The risk of stent thrombosis is still present. The surgery, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, carries a low-to-moderate bleeding risk. Stopping both drugs is too risky. Continuing both drugs may cause excessive bleeding. The elegant compromise is to **continue the aspirin** but **stop the more potent clopidogrel 5 days before surgery**. This approach walks the tightrope, providing a degree of protection against clotting while lowering the bleeding risk to an acceptable level for the procedure.

This principle extends to common painkillers. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like naproxen are non-selective and also inhibit COX-1, thus impairing platelets. Because their action is *reversible*, we can simply use their **half-life ($t_{1/2}$)**—the time it takes for half the drug to be eliminated—to guide us. Holding a reversible drug for about 3 to 5 half-lives is enough for its effect to wash out. For naproxen, with a half-life of about 12-17 hours, holding it for 3 days is a sensible strategy. In contrast, a selective **COX-2 inhibitor** like celecoxib doesn't affect platelet COX-1, so it poses no bleeding risk and can be continued right up to surgery to help control pain [@problem_id:4660041]. It's all in the mechanism.

**Anticoagulants: Weakening the Mortar**

Other drugs, like the Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) such as **apixaban**, work on the coagulation cascade. They block key factors, like Factor Xa, preventing the formation of fibrin mortar. For a patient with atrial fibrillation, apixaban is crucial for preventing a stroke. Here again, the decision to stop the drug is dictated by its pharmacokinetics. Apixaban has a half-life of about 12 hours in a person with normal kidneys. By holding it for 48 hours (4 half-lives), the anticoagulant effect is reduced by over $90\%$, making surgery safe. We must also account for patient factors; a person with chronic kidney disease will clear the drug more slowly, so a longer hold period may be necessary [@problem_id:4958535].

### The Unsung Heroes and The Non-Negotiables

While many medications require a complex risk-benefit discussion, some decisions are far more straightforward. These are the drugs whose continuation is almost always paramount to the patient's safety.

At the top of this list are **[beta-blockers](@entry_id:174887)** and **statins**. For patients with coronary artery disease, these are cardioprotective superheroes. Beta-blockers slow the heart rate and reduce its oxygen demand, while statins stabilize plaques in the arteries and reduce inflammation. For a patient on chronic therapy, abruptly stopping these medications can lead to rebound tachycardia or a surge of inflammation, significantly increasing the risk of a perioperative heart attack. The rule is simple: **if you're on them, you stay on them** [@problem_id:4883426]. But this reveals a fascinating duality: what is good chronically can be dangerous if started acutely. Initiating a high-dose beta-blocker right before surgery, without time for the body to adapt, can cause severe hypotension and even stroke. Safe initiation must be done slowly, over days or weeks, not hours [@problem_id:4883426].

Even more critical are the **antiseizure medications**. For a patient with controlled epilepsy, their medication is the only thing standing between them and a seizure. The therapeutic window for these drugs is often narrow. As we can calculate using pharmacokinetic principles, missing even a single dose of a drug with a short half-life, like levetiracetam, can cause drug levels to plummet into a subtherapeutic range, creating a high risk of a breakthrough seizure [@problem_id:4659779]. A seizure during or after surgery is a catastrophe, risking aspiration, injury, and severe metabolic distress. The principle is absolute: **maintain therapeutic coverage at all costs**. This is not a matter for debate but for logistical planning—arranging for intravenous (IV) formulations, or administering crushed tablets through a nasogastric tube. It requires foresight and teamwork [@problem_id:4659779].

### Guarding the Mind: The Threat of Delirium

So far, our focus has been on the heart and blood. But the brain is perhaps the most delicate organ of all. **Postoperative delirium**—an acute state of confusion, inattention, and fluctuating consciousness—is a common and devastating complication, especially in older adults. It is not a benign confusion; it is a sign of acute brain failure, like a fever of the mind.

One of the leading hypotheses for delirium is a deficiency of a key neurotransmitter, **acetylcholine**. Therefore, any medication that blocks acetylcholine's action—an **anticholinergic** drug—is a potential trigger. A rogues' gallery of common culprits includes certain older antidepressants (like amitriptyline), drugs for overactive bladder (oxybutynin), and even over-the-counter sleep aids and allergy pills (diphenhydramine, the active ingredient in Benadryl) [@problem_id:4659955].

For a high-risk patient—one who is elderly, has pre-existing memory issues, and is taking multiple anticholinergic drugs—proactive management is essential. We must become "deprescribing" detectives in the weeks leading up to surgery. The goal is to systematically and carefully reduce the patient's total **anticholinergic burden**. This is done not by stopping everything at once, but by a thoughtful, gradual process: tapering one offending drug while substituting a safer, non-anticholinergic alternative to manage the underlying symptom, be it pain, bladder control, or insomnia [@problem_id:5174034]. This is the pinnacle of personalized, preventative perioperative care.

Even with the best planning, complications can occur. When a patient develops a new problem postoperatively, like a fever, our first thought is often infection. But we must always ask: "Could it be a drug?" The syndrome of **drug fever**, which can present days into a medication course with classic signs like a rash, a high fever with a relatively slow heart rate, and specific changes in the white blood cell count, is a perfect final reminder. The medications we use to prevent and treat disease are powerful forces. Managing them around surgery is a journey that reveals the beautiful, intricate, and unified principles of human physiology. It is a science, an art, and a profound responsibility [@problem_id:5173348].
