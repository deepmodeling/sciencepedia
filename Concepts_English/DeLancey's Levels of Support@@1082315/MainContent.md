## Introduction
The female pelvic floor is a masterpiece of biological engineering, a dynamic system of muscles, ligaments, and fascia tasked with supporting pelvic organs against immense and variable forces. When this support system weakens, it can lead to pelvic organ prolapse, a condition that affects millions of women. However, simply identifying "prolapse" is insufficient for effective treatment; a deeper understanding of the specific mechanical failure is required. This is the knowledge gap addressed by the elegant and powerful framework of DeLancey's levels of support.

This article provides a comprehensive overview of this foundational model, which re-conceptualizes pelvic support as a hierarchical, three-tiered system. By viewing the pelvic anatomy through this engineering lens, we can transform diagnosis and treatment from guesswork into a precise science. The following chapters will first delve into the **Principles and Mechanisms** of each of the three levels, explaining their unique roles and interconnected functions. We will then explore the model's clinical value in **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, demonstrating how it guides surgeons and clinicians in diagnosing specific defects and designing durable, patient-specific repairs.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Imagine you are an engineer tasked with a seemingly impossible challenge: design a structure at the base of the human torso that can support the weight of several heavy organs against the constant pull of gravity. This structure must also withstand sudden, immense spikes in pressure—from a cough, a laugh, or lifting a heavy object. But that’s not all. This floor cannot be solid; it must have openings that can open and close on command for urination, defecation, and, in half the population, be capable of the monumental task of childbirth. How would you solve such a complex problem?

Nature’s solution, refined over millennia of evolution, is the pelvic floor. It is not a simple, brute-force slab of muscle, but an elegant, multi-layered system of interacting ligaments, fascia (sheets of connective tissue), and muscles. To truly appreciate this marvel of [biological engineering](@entry_id:270890), we can look at it through the lens of a simple yet profound framework developed by the anatomist John DeLancey. This framework reveals that pelvic support is not a single entity, but a hierarchical, three-tiered system, much like a masterfully pitched suspension tent.

### Level I: The Master Suspension Cable

At the very top of the system, we find **Level I support**. Think of this as the main, central pole and the primary suspension cables of our tent. Its job is to suspend the highest point of the vagina and the uterus (the **apex**) from the strong, immovable bones of the pelvis—specifically, the sacrum at the back and the pelvic sidewalls. The structures that accomplish this are the **uterosacral** and **cardinal ligaments**, a robust complex of fibrous tissue that forms a kind of suspensory hammock around the cervix.

But the genius of this design isn't just in the suspension; it's in how it interacts with the forces acting upon it. The vagina is not a vertical tube. It is normally tilted backward, resting on a muscular shelf formed by the **levator ani** muscles. When you cough or strain, the downward surge of intra-abdominal pressure doesn't just push the uterus straight down. Instead, because of this backward angle, the pressure forces the upper vagina against the muscular floor, creating a "flap-valve" effect that helps seal the opening from above. The ligaments of Level I then expertly translate this downward push into pure tension, pulling the apex upward and backward toward their strong anchor points on the sacrum [@problem_id:4485685]. The cervix is the specific anatomical structure to which these primary suspension cables are attached, which is precisely why, when this level fails, it is the cervix that leads the descent in uterine prolapse [@problem_id:4524271].

The absolute authority of Level I support becomes crystal clear when we model it with simple physics. Imagine the entire pelvic support system as a set of springs working together to resist a downward force, say a load $F$ of $20 \, \mathrm{N}$ from a heavy cough. The stiff, strong ligaments of Level I can be modeled as a very stiff spring with a stiffness constant $k_a = 3000 \, \mathrm{N/m}$. The supports for the vaginal side walls (Level II, which we'll discuss next) are like a less stiff spring, with $k_p = 1000 \, \mathrm{N/m}$. When both spring systems are intact and working in parallel, they share the load. The stiffer apical spring, by its very nature, takes the lion's share of the force. In this case, it bears $15 \, \mathrm{N}$ (75% of the load), while the weaker side-wall attachments only have to manage a mere $5 \, \mathrm{N}$. The entire system displaces by only $5 \, \mathrm{mm}$ [@problem_id:4484479].

Now, let's witness what happens when Level I fails—when we "cut" the apical spring so its stiffness $k_a$ drops to nearly zero. The entire $20 \, \mathrm{N}$ load, previously managed mostly by the robust apical ligaments, now slams onto the weaker Level II attachments. They are instantly overloaded, bearing a force four times greater than what they were designed to handle. The result is catastrophic failure: they stretch dramatically, and the system displaces by $20 \, \mathrm{mm}$, a fourfold increase. This simple model powerfully demonstrates why Level I is not just one of three supports; it is the hierarchical linchpin. Its failure inevitably leads to the overload and subsequent failure of the structures below it [@problem_id:4485613]. Clinically, this is seen as a descent of the apex, where the cervix (point $C$ in a clinical exam) drops below its normal station, as illustrated in the prolapse scenario where point $C$ was measured at $+2 \, \mathrm{cm}$ [@problem_id:4485557].

### Level II: The Lateral Guy-Wires

If Level I is the central pole, **Level II support** represents the guy-wires that stretch from the sides of the tent canvas to stakes in the ground. Anatomically, this level consists of the attachments of the side walls of the mid-vagina to the pelvic sidewalls. A specific condensation of fascia called the **arcus tendineus fasciae pelvis (ATFP)** acts as the anchoring line. These lateral tethers hold the anterior and posterior vaginal walls in place, preventing the bladder (anteriorly) and the rectum (posteriorly) from bulging into the vaginal space.

Here, we encounter another layer of elegant design: the distinction between fascial support and muscular support. The ATFP is the fascial anchor for the vaginal *wall* itself. If this fascial attachment is torn or stretched—a **paravaginal defect**—the wall detaches from the side and bulges inward, creating a cystocele or rectocele. This can happen even if the main muscular floor is intact. In contrast, a nearby structure, the **arcus tendineus levator ani (ATLA)**, is the attachment point for the levator ani *muscle*. An injury here affects the muscle's ability to constrict the pelvic opening, a different problem altogether [@problem_id:4484391].

Failure of Level II support, therefore, leads to bulging of the mid-vaginal walls. This is the classic cause of a **cystocele** (anterior wall prolapse) or **rectocele** (posterior wall prolapse). In such cases, the apex (Level I) may remain perfectly well-supported, but the "guy-wires" holding the sides of the tent have snapped, causing the walls to sag. This is precisely what is observed in a patient with a well-supported cervix (point $C$ at $-4 \, \mathrm{cm}$) but a severely bulging anterior wall (point $Ba$ at $+4 \, \mathrm{cm}$) [@problem_id:4485557].

### Level III: The Foundation and the Doorway

Finally, we arrive at the base of our structure, **Level III support**. This level is responsible for fusing the lowest part of the vagina and urethra to the surrounding structures, effectively anchoring the entire tent to the ground. It has two critical and distinct functions: providing a stable foundation and controlling the doorway.

First, as the foundation, it involves the fusion of the distal vagina to the **perineal body**, a central, fibrous hub of muscle and connective tissue located between the vagina and the anus. This anchors the distal end of the vaginal tube, completing the support system.

Second, and perhaps more dynamically, Level III governs the "doorway" of the pelvic floor—the **urogenital hiatus**. The critical player here is the levator ani muscle group, which forms a U-shaped sling. The incredible importance of this muscle is revealed by a simple thought experiment. If you were to selectively denervate the levator ani muscle, the entire muscular floor would fail. The hiatus would gape open, and the organs above, having lost their supportive shelf, would descend centrally in a multicompartment prolapse. In contrast, if you were to preserve the levator ani but denervate the more superficial muscles of the perineum and the external sphincters (via the **pudendal nerve**), you would have a different problem: the main support shelf would be intact, but the "latch" on the doorway would be broken, leading to incontinence and distal perineal descent [@problem_id:4482981].

This "doorway" function is absolutely crucial for urinary continence. The distal attachments of Level III provide a stable backboard or "hammock" against which the urethra is compressed during a pressure spike like a cough. When Level III support is damaged, this backboard is lost. The urethra, no longer securely anchored, becomes hypermobile. When you cough, instead of being compressed shut, it swings downward and opens, resulting in **stress urinary incontinence**. This mechanism can be clinically diagnosed by observing this hypermobility with a simple cotton-swab test [@problem_id:4484397].

### A Unified System

DeLancey's levels are not three independent structures but a deeply interconnected, hierarchical system. Level I provides the master suspension, without which the entire structure is compromised. Level II stabilizes the walls, relying on the tension provided by an intact Level I. Level III provides the foundational anchor and dynamic closure, supporting the structures above it.

This elegant model is not just a beautiful piece of anatomical theory; it is a powerful predictive tool. By understanding which level has failed, a clinician can understand the patient's symptoms—be it a descending uterus (Level I failure), a bladder bulge (Level II failure), or urinary leakage (Level III failure). This precise diagnosis, born from an appreciation of nature's brilliant engineering, guides targeted and effective therapies, from selecting the right supportive pessary to planning the most appropriate surgical repair [@problem_id:4486186]. The pelvic floor is a symphony of structures, and in understanding its principles and mechanisms, we see the unity and beauty of its design.
