## Introduction
How can one map the inner structure of a miniature star confined within a laboratory? This is the central challenge in [fusion energy](@article_id:159643) research and [plasma physics](@article_id:138657). Plasmas, the fourth state of matter, are so hot and tenuous that any physical probe inserted into them would be instantly destroyed, simultaneously disrupting the very object of study. This article addresses this fundamental problem by exploring the powerful method of [plasma](@article_id:136188) tomography, a technique for seeing the invisible. It works by reconstructing a complete, cross-sectional image of the [plasma](@article_id:136188) from measurements made entirely from the outside.

This article will guide you through the physics and application of this ingenious diagnostic tool. In the "Principles and Mechanisms" section, we will delve into the mathematical heart of tomography, understanding how integrated signals along a line of sight can be "un-bundled" to reveal local properties, with a special focus on the elegant Abel inversion for symmetric systems. Following that, the "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" section will showcase the versatility of this approach, revealing how it is used to map a [plasma](@article_id:136188)'s density, [temperature](@article_id:145715), invisible [magnetic fields](@article_id:271967), and even its [internal flow](@article_id:155142), painting a complete picture of this complex and dynamic state of matter.

{'applications': '## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections\n\nNow that we have grappled with the mathematical heart of tomography, the beautiful idea of reconstructing an object from its shadows, we can ask the most exciting question of all: What can we *do* with it? If our subject were a person\'s head, the answer would be straightforward: a medical CT scan, creating a map of tissue density to find tumors or injuries. But our subject is a [plasma](@article_id:136188)—a turbulent, searingly hot state of matter, a miniature star held captive in a machine. A [plasma](@article_id:136188) is not a simple, static object. It has density, [temperature](@article_id:145715), pressure; it writhes and flows; it is threaded with invisible [magnetic fields](@article_id:271967).\n\nCan we hope to map all of a [plasma](@article_id:136188)\'s secrets with tomography? The answer, astonishingly, is yes. Plasma tomography is not a single instrument but a whole philosophy, a versatile toolkit that draws on nearly every branch of physics to build a complete, multi-layered portrait of this extraordinary substance. It is here, in its applications, that the true power and elegance of the tomographic principle are revealed.\n\n### Mapping the Plasma\'s Substance: Density and Its Quirks\n\nLet\'s start with the most fundamental property: density. How much "stuff" is there, and where is it? The [plasma](@article_id:136188) physicist\'s tool of choice for this is often an [interferometer](@article_id:261290). By sending a [laser](@article_id:193731) beam through the [plasma](@article_id:136188) and comparing its phase to an identical beam that travels through a vacuum, we can measure the total number of [electrons](@article_id:136939) the beam encountered along its path [@problem_id:270516]. This line-integrated measurement is the "shadow" from which we will reconstruct our density map. A whole fan of such beams gives us a complete set of projections, and the tomographic [algorithm](@article_id:267625) gets to work.\n\nBut what happens if our fiery [plasma](@article_id:136188) isn\'t perfectly centered in its magnetic container? What if it wobbles or shifts? Does our diagnostic system get confused? On the contrary! It provides a vital clue. A simple horizontal shift of the [plasma column](@article_id:194028) results in a corresponding horizontal shift in the profile of our line-integrated measurements. By tracking the "[center of mass](@article_id:137858)" of our data, we can track the position of the [plasma](@article_id:136188) itself_ with exquisite precision, giving vital feedback to the [control systems](@article_id:154797) that keep it stable [@problem_id:270550]. The imperfection becomes a source of information.\n\nNature is rarely perfectly symmetrical. Plasmas can be stretched, squashed, or distorted into complex shapes by powerful magnetic forces. A full [tomographic reconstruction](@article_id:198857) can certainly reveal this. But sometimes, we can learn what we need to know more elegantly. By borrowing tools from the world of high-end optics, we can characterize these asymmetries in a powerful way. For instance, a [plasma](@article_id:136188) might develop an "[astigmatism](@article_id:173884)," meaning it\'s focused differently in the horizontal and vertical directions. Instead of a full reconstruction, we can calculate a specific [weighted average](@article_id:143343)—a "moment"—of our projection data. It turns out that this single number is directly proportional to the amount of [astigmatism](@article_id:173884) in the [plasma](@article_id:136188)\'s density profile. This allows us to spot and quantify specific undesirable shapes instantly, without the full computational cost of an inversion [@problem_id:270707].\n\n### Taking the Plasma\'s Temperature\n\nKnowing where the [plasma](@article_id:136188) is located is one thing; knowing how hot it is is another. To map the [temperature](@article_id:145715), we need a different kind of probe. One of the most powerful is Thomson [scattering](@article_id:139888), where we fire a high-power [laser](@article_id:193731) into the [plasma](@article_id:136188) and watch how the light scatters off the free [electrons](@article_id:136939). The scattered light is "smeared out" in frequency by the Doppler effect, and the width of this smear tells us the local [electron temperature](@article_id:179786).\n\nApplying tomography to this is a fascinating challenge. Instead of just a simple [line integral](@article_id:137613), we often turn to a more sophisticated approach rooted in [linear algebra](@article_id:145246). We might propose that the 2D [temperature](@article_id:145715) map we\'re looking for can be built from a combination of simple, predefined shapes—a set of mathematical "[basis functions](@article_id:146576)." These could be simple [polynomials](@article_id:274943) or more complex functions tailored to the circular geometry. Our job, then, is not to find the [temperature](@article_id:145715) at every single point, but to find the right "recipe" of these [basis functions](@article_id:146576). Our set of Thomson [scattering](@article_id:139888) measurements along different chords provides exactly the information needed to solve for the coefficients in this recipe. The problem transforms from an infinite-dimensional puzzle to solving a finite [system of linear equations](@article_id:139922), a much more manageable task that lies at the heart of modern reconstruction algorithms [@problem_id:367400].\n\n### Sensing the Unseen: Magnetic Fields and Motion\n\nHere we venture into territory that seems almost magical. Can we take a picture of something truly invisible, like a [magnetic field](@article_id:152802)? With tomography, we can. The key is the Faraday effect: the [polarization of light](@article_id:261586) twists as it propagates through a magnetized medium. The total angle of rotation depends on the line-integral of the product of the [plasma density](@article_id:202342) and the [magnetic field](@article_id:152802) component along the [laser](@article_id:193731)\'s path.\n\nThis presents a wonderful puzzle. The measurement depends on *two* unknown quantities, density and [magnetic field](@article_id:152802), all mixed up together in one integral. How can we possibly untangle them? The answer is to use more than one tool at once! We already have a way to measure the [line-integrated density](@article_id:202671) using [interferometry](@article_id:158017). If we perform an [interferometry](@article_id:158017) measurement and a [polarization](@article_id:157624) measurement along the very same path, we have two pieces of information. We can use the density measurement to "divide out" its influence from the Faraday rotation data, leaving us with a pure measurement of the line-integrated [magnetic field](@article_id:152802) [@problem_id:256450]. From these projections, tomography can then reconstruct the 2D map of the invisible [magnetic field](@article_id:152802) structure that holds the [plasma](@article_id:136188) together.\n\nBut perhaps the most breathtaking application of [plasma](@article_id:136188) tomography is its ability to map not just what the [plasma](@article_id:136188) *is*, but what it *does*. We can map its flow. The technique is called Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF). We tune a [laser](@article_id:193731) to a very specific frequency that a particular ion in the [plasma](@article_id:136188) likes to absorb. Due to the Doppler effect, if an ion is moving towards the [laser](@article_id:193731), it "sees" the light shifted to a higher frequency, and if it\'s moving away, it sees it at a lower frequency. This means that by precisely controlling our [laser](@article_id:193731)\'s frequency, we can choose to interact *only with ions that have a specific velocity component along the direction of the [laser](@article_id:193731)*.\n\nImagine a [plasma](@article_id:136188) rotating like a solid wheel. If we send a [laser](@article_id:193731) beam through its center, the ions are moving sideways, not towards or away from the [laser](@article_id:193731), so we see a strong signal at the natural absorption frequency. But if we send the beam through the edge, where the ions are moving directly towards us, we must shift our [laser](@article_id:193731) to a lower frequency to get a signal. If we probe the other edge, where they\'re moving away, we must shift to a higher frequency.\n\nBy sweeping the [laser](@article_id:193731) frequency and the beam\'s position, we are performing tomography not just in physical space, but in *[velocity space](@article_id:180722)*. We are building up a dataset that tells us, for each line of sight, how many ions there are at each and every velocity. Reconstructing this `(x, y, v_x)` datacube gives us a complete map of the [plasma](@article_id:136188)\'s [velocity field](@article_id:270967) [@problem_id:277190]. We are, in a very real sense, watching the [plasma](@article_id:136188) flow.\n\n### A Symphony of Diagnostics\n\nFrom simple density maps to tracking wiggles and asymmetries; from taking its [temperature](@article_id:145715) to revealing the hidden architecture of [magnetic fields](@article_id:271967) and the intricate dance of its internal flows—[plasma](@article_id:136188) tomography is a testament to scientific ingenuity. It is a profoundly interdisciplinary field, a place where the principles of [medical imaging](@article_id:269155), optics, [atomic physics](@article_id:140329), and advanced mathematics converge.\n\nIt shows us that by asking clever questions with beams of light, and by listening patiently to the answers they bring back, we can translate the ghostly shadows of a [plasma](@article_id:136188) into a rich, detailed, and dynamic understanding. We learn to see the invisible, illuminating the complex and beautiful world of the fourth state of matter.', '#text': '## Principles and Mechanisms\n\nImagine you are trying to understand the intricate structure of a cloud of smoke without being able to fly through it. You can shine a [laser](@article_id:193731) pointer through it and see how much the beam dims. You can look at the faint light it scatters from a lamp in the room. From these external observations, could you reconstruct a full, three-dimensional map of the smoke\'s density? This is, in essence, the challenge of [plasma](@article_id:136188) tomography. We want to see inside a blistering hot, [magnetically confined plasma](@article_id:202234)—a miniature star in a bottle—without sticking in a probe that would be instantly vaporized. The "pictures" we take are not with a simple camera, but through clever measurements of light or particles that have traveled through the [plasma](@article_id:136188), carrying secrets of their journey with them.\n\n### The Shadow Play: From Integrated Signals to Local Truths\n\nThe fundamental principle behind any tomographic measurement is the **[line integral](@article_id:137613)**. Think back to the [laser](@article_id:193731) pointer and the smoke. The amount of light absorbed depends on the total number of smoke particles the beam encountered along its entire path. It doesn\'t tell you whether the smoke was a dense little puff in the middle or a uniform haze all the way through. This measured value—a single number representing a whole path—is a line-integrated quantity.\n\nLet\'s make this more precise. If a [laser](@article_id:193731) beam travels through a [plasma](@article_id:136188), its intensity $I$ will decrease according to the Beer-Lambert law. The amount of absorption is related to an **[optical depth](@article_id:158523)**, $\\tau$, which is the integral of the local **[absorption coefficient](@article_id:156047)**, $\\alpha$, along the path $L$ of the [laser](@article_id:193731):\n$$ \\tau = \\int_L \\alpha(\\mathbf{r}) \\, dl $$\nThe final intensity is $I_{out} = I_{in} \\exp(-\\tau)$. So, by measuring the dimming of the [laser](@article_id:193731), we measure $\\tau$.\n\nFor instance, if we have a cylindrical [plasma](@article_id:136188) where the density of absorbing atoms follows a smooth, bell-shaped Gaussian profile, $\\alpha(r) = \\alpha_0 \\exp(-r^2/r_0^2)$, a beam passing through the center will experience a total [optical depth](@article_id:158523) that is a simple product of the peak absorption $\\alpha_0$, the characteristic radius $r_0$, and $\\sqrt{\\pi}$ [@problem_id:303625]. The measurement gives us a single value, $\\tau = \\alpha_0 r_0 \\sqrt{\\pi}$, bundling together the peak density and the width of the [plasma](@article_id:136188). Our challenge is to un-bundle them. To do this with a single measurement is impossible. We need more information—we need to look from more than one direction. This transition from the "forward problem" (predicting the measurement from a known [plasma](@article_id:136188)) to the "inverse problem" (deducing the [plasma](@article_id:136188) from measurements) is the heart of tomography.\n\n### The Onion-Peeling Trick: A Shortcut for Circles\n\nWhat if our [plasma](@article_id:136188) is special? What if it\'s perfectly, beautifully cylindrically symmetric? Think of a perfectly still candle flame or an idealized, non-rotating star. In this case, the property we want to measure, say the local [emissivity](@article_id:142794) $\\epsilon(r)$ (how much light is produced at a radius $r$), only depends on the distance from the center. This symmetry is a tremendous gift. It means we don\'t need to look from all angles; views from one side are enough. More importantly, it allows for an elegant and exact mathematical solution to the inverse problem: the **Abel Inversion**.\n\nImagine looking at this glowing cylinder from the side. A detector, scanning from top to bottom, measures the brightness profile $I(y)$, where $y$ is the "[impact parameter](@article_id:165038)"—the [perpendicular distance](@article_id:175785) from the central axis to the line of sight. A line of sight passing through the very edge of the [plasma](@article_id:136188) only sees the faint, outermost layer. A line of sight passing closer to the center sees the contribution of the layer it passes through, *plus* the contributions from all the layers further out that it also has to look through.\n\nThe Abel inversion is a mathematical formalization of peeling an onion. It tells us precisely how to subtract the contributions of the outer layers to isolate the emission coming from just one specific radius $r$. The forward problem—calculating the measured brightness $I(y)$ from the local [emissivity](@article_id:142794) $\\epsilon(r)$—is given by the forward Abel transform:\n\n$$ I(y) = 2 \\int_{y}^{R} \\frac{\\epsilon(r) r \\, dr}{\\sqrt{r^2 - y^2}} $$\n\nThe magic is that this equation can be "inverted." The inverse Abel transform allows us to recover the local [emissivity](@article_id:142794) from the *slope* of our measured brightness profile:\n\n$$ \\epsilon(r) = -\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{r}^{R} \\frac{dI/dy}{\\sqrt{y^2-r^2}} \\, dy $$\n\nThis powerful technique is not limited to emission. It works for any line-integrated measurement in a cylindrical geometry, whether it\'s the [phase shift](@article_id:153848) measured by an [interferometer](@article_id:261290) to find [electron density](@article_id:139019) [@problem_id:270721], or the absorption of a [laser](@article_id:193731) beam to find neutral atom density.
