## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Now that we have explored the fundamental principles of [viscoelasticity](@article_id:147551), the real fun begins. What can we *do* with the knowledge of a material's storage modulus ($G'$) and loss modulus ($G''$)? It turns out that measuring these two numbers is like being given a pair of magic spectacles. By putting them on and looking at a material while "plucking" it at different frequencies, we can suddenly see into its soul. We can discern its inner structure, watch it transform in real-time, predict its future, and even understand the subtle language of life itself. The story of $G'$ and $G''$ is not just a story about gooey materials; itâ€™s a journey across the frontiers of chemistry, engineering, and biology.

### A Spectroscope for the State of Matter

The most immediate question we can answer is: what *is* this stuff? Is it a solid, a liquid, or something in between? The moduli $G'$ and $G''$ give us a quantitative answer. Consider a [biofilm](@article_id:273055), the slimy, complex city that bacteria like *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* build for themselves [@problem_id:2479481]. Is this city a solid fortress or a fluid metropolis? The answer depends on your timescale.

If we perform an oscillatory test and poke the [biofilm](@article_id:273055) very quickly (at a high [angular frequency](@article_id:274022), $\omega$), the long polymer chains and other components of its extracellular matrix don't have time to rearrange or flow past one another. The material resists deformation elastically.
