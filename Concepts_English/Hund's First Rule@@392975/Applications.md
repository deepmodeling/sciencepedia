## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Now that we have grappled with the quantum mechanical origins of Hund’s First Rule—the remarkable tendency of electrons to align their spins in parallel—we are ready for a grand tour. This is no mere academic curiosity, no subtle footnote in the quantum playbook. This
