## Introduction
In the quantum realm of crystalline solids, the behavior of electrons is dictated by their [energy band structure](@article_id:264051). While insulators have filled bands separated by large gaps and metals have overlapping bands, a more exotic possibility arises when bands touch at isolated points. For a long time, these points were considered unstable accidents, easily destroyed by the slightest imperfection. This article addresses the fascinating question: what if these crossings are not accidental but are instead robust, topologically protected entities? These entities, known as Weyl nodes, represent a novel state of matter with profound physical consequences. In the following sections, we will first delve into the fundamental principles and mechanisms that define Weyl nodes, exploring their stability, chirality, and unique signatures like Fermi arcs. We will then transition to their diverse applications and surprising connections to other fields, from electronics to optics, showcasing the true impact of this topological discovery.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Imagine the world of electrons inside a crystal. It isn't a chaotic swarm, but a beautifully ordered dance governed by the quantum mechanical laws of the crystal's periodic structure. The allowable energies for these electrons aren't continuous; they are organized into distinct **[energy bands](@article_id:146082)**, separated by forbidden zones, or **band gaps**. A material might be an insulator, with its electrons content to fill the lower bands, separated by a large gap from the empty upper bands. Or it could be a metal, where bands overlap, leaving a sea of electrons free to roam and conduct electricity.

But what happens in the curious case where two bands don't overlap, nor are they fully separate, but instead just *touch* at a single point in the abstract space of electron momentum? For a long time, physicists considered such "accidental" touchings to be fragile curiosities. Like balancing a pencil on its tip, the slightest imperfection in the crystal should break the symmetry and either push the bands apart, creating a gap, or press them together, creating a larger overlap. But what if some deeper principle could make these touching points robust, unmovable, and stable? What if they were not accidents at all, but fundamental, protected features? This is the gateway to the world of topology in materials, and at the heart of it lies a fascinating object: the **Weyl point**.

### A Stable Knot in Momentum Space

A Weyl point is not just any band touching. It is a point-like crossing of the conduction and valence bands in three-dimensional momentum space that is topologically protected. Near one of these points, the relationship between an electron's energy $E$ and its momentum $\mathbf{k}$ (relative to the node) is wonderfully simple: it's a straight line. The bands form a perfect cone, described by a [linear dispersion relation](@article_id:265819) like $E(\mathbf{k}) \approx \pm v |\mathbf{k}|$ [@problem_id:1827820]. The electrons near this point behave as if they are massless, much like photons, an astonishing emergence of relativistic physics in a solid-state material.

Why is this conical point so special and stable? The answer lies in its underlying mathematical structure. Near the node, a simple two-band Hamiltonian can be written as $H(\mathbf{q}) = \mathbf{d}(\mathbf{q}) \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}$, where $\mathbf{q}$ is the small momentum deviation from the node, and $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is a vector of Pauli matrices. For a true Weyl node, the vector $\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{q})$ is linear in all three momentum components: $\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{q}) \approx (v_x q_x, v_y q_y, v_z q_z)$. To find the band touching point, we must solve $\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{q}) = \mathbf{0}$. This gives us three independent equations for three unknowns ($q_x, q_y, q_z$), which an-chors the solution to a single, stable point: $\mathbf{q}=\mathbf{0}$.

Contrast this with a merely "accidental" touching, where the dispersion might be linear in $q_x$ and $q_y$ but quadratic in $q_z$. The condition for touching now only involves two equations, which isn't enough to pin down a single point in 3D. Such a touching is unstable; a generic, tiny perturbation, like a stray magnetic field or a slight strain, can immediately destroy it and open a gap. A Weyl point, however, is topologically protected. It's like a knot in a rope: you can't undo it by simply jiggling the rope. The crossing is guaranteed by a fundamental topological property [@problem_id:3024309]. Any small perturbation might shift the node's position slightly or warp the cone, but it cannot eliminate it. The only way to destroy a Weyl point is for it to meet another Weyl point of opposite character and annihilate—a process we'll soon explore.

### Chirality: The Topological "Charge"

What is this [topological property](@article_id:141111) that gives a Weyl point its identity and stability? It’s a quantized number called **chirality**, which we can think of as a topological "charge". Every Weyl point is a monopole—either a source or a sink—of a quantum field called the **Berry curvature** in momentum space. We assign this charge an integer value, $\chi$, which is typically $+1$ (a source) or $-1$ (a sink).

This charge isn't just an abstract label; it can be calculated. Imagine drawing a tiny sphere in [momentum space](@article_id:148442) that completely encloses a single Weyl point. For each point $\mathbf{k}$ on the surface of this sphere, the Hamiltonian gives us a [direction vector](@article_id:169068) $\hat{\mathbf{d}}(\mathbf{k})$. As we move across the entire surface of our small sphere, the tip of this [direction vector](@article_id:169068) $\hat{\mathbf{d}}$ will trace a pattern on its own sphere of all possible directions. For a Weyl point, this pattern wraps around the sphere of directions exactly once. The [chirality](@article_id:143611) $\chi$ is simply the winding number of this map: it's $+1$ if the wrapping is, say, counter-clockwise, and $-1$ if it's clockwise.

Mathematically, this [winding number](@article_id:138213) is given by the sign of the determinant of the Jacobian matrix $M_{ij} = \partial d_i / \partial k_j$ that describes the linear dispersion near the node. The chirality is $\chi = \mathrm{sgn}(\det M)$ [@problem_id:3024257, @problem_id:525896]. Since this is an integer, it cannot change continuously to zero. A small perturbation can't unwrap the map, and so the charge, and thus the Weyl point itself, remains stable.

### The Rules of the Game in a Crystal

These topological charges don't exist in a vacuum. Inside a crystal, they must obey a strict set of rules, much like particles in the Standard Model.

The first and most important rule is the **Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem**. It states that within the entire periodic universe of a crystal's [momentum space](@article_id:148442) (the Brillouin zone), the total topological charge must be zero. The sum of all chiralities must cancel out: $\sum_i \chi_i = 0$ [@problem_id:1827866]. This means a Weyl point with $\chi = +1$ cannot exist by itself. It must be born with a partner of opposite charge, a $\chi = -1$ point, somewhere else in the Brillouin zone. This is profoundly similar to how magnetic monopoles, if they existed, would have to be created in north-south pairs. The simplest possible **Weyl semimetal** must contain at least one pair of oppositely charged Weyl points.

The existence and configuration of these points are deeply governed by the [fundamental symmetries](@article_id:160762) of the crystal. Consider a material that possesses both **[time-reversal symmetry](@article_id:137600)** (the laws of physics run the same forwards and backwards in time) and **inversion symmetry** (the crystal looks the same when viewed from a point $\mathbf{r}$ as from $-\mathbf{r}$). In such a highly symmetric crystal, you can't have Weyl points. Instead, if bands touch, they form a more complex, four-fold degenerate touching point called a **Dirac point**. You can think of a Dirac point as two Weyl points with opposite [chirality](@article_id:143611), $\chi=+1$ and $\chi=-1$, which are forced by the high symmetry to sit at the exact same location in [momentum space](@article_id:148442), their charges cancelling locally [@problem_id:1827867].

To liberate the Weyl points, you must break this deadlock. You need to break either time-reversal symmetry (for instance, by making the material magnetic) or inversion symmetry (which is common in crystals that have a "handedness"). Breaking either of these symmetries acts like a wedge, splitting the Dirac point into a pair of distinct Weyl points that move apart in momentum space [@problem_id:1827852]. This process is the birth of a Weyl semimetal from a Dirac semimetal.

Furthermore, the specific symmetries that remain impose even stricter rules. If a material breaks inversion symmetry but preserves time-reversal symmetry, something remarkable happens. Time-reversal symmetry dictates that if there's a Weyl point with [chirality](@article_id:143611) $\chi$ at momentum $\mathbf{k}$, there must be another one with the *same* chirality $\chi$ at $-\mathbf{k}$. To satisfy the zero-sum rule of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem, you can't just have one such pair. You must have at least *two* pairs: one pair with $\chi=+1$ at $(\mathbf{k}_1, -\mathbf{k}_1)$ and another pair with $\chi=-1$ at $(\mathbf{k}_2, -\mathbf{k}_2)$. Therefore, the minimum number of Weyl nodes in such a material is four! [@problem_id:1135081]

### Seeing the Unseen: Fermi Arcs

So, we have these fascinating topological objects governed by beautiful rules. But what are their observable consequences? How do we know they are really there?

One subtle consequence is in the material's bulk properties. The linear dispersion $E \propto |\mathbf{k}|$ leads to a very specific **[density of states](@article_id:147400)**—the number of available electronic states at a given energy. For a Weyl semimetal, this density of states grows quadratically with energy, $g(E) \propto E^2$ [@problem_id:1827820], a distinct signature that differentiates it from ordinary metals.

But the most spectacular and definitive evidence is not found in the bulk of the material, but on its surface. This is a profound principle known as the **[bulk-boundary correspondence](@article_id:137153)**: a non-[trivial topology](@article_id:153515) in the bulk of a material must produce unique states at its boundary. The Weyl points in the bulk, as monopoles of Berry curvature, create a kind of topological "flux" between them. On the surface of the crystal, this flux manifests as a new kind of electronic state: the **Fermi arc**.

In any normal metal, the collection of states at the Fermi energy (the "Fermi surface") must form closed loops. An electron can travel along such a loop forever. But when scientists use techniques like Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) to look at the surface of a Weyl semimetal, they see something that should be impossible: an open line segment of electronic states. This Fermi arc is a path that literally just starts at the surface projection of a Weyl point with one [chirality](@article_id:143611) and ends at the projection of another with opposite chirality, where it disappears into the bulk bands [@problem_id:1827872].

We can visualize this beautifully by thinking of the 3D material as a stack of 2D layers in [momentum space](@article_id:148442) along, say, the $k_z$ direction. For any $k_z$ slice that falls between two Weyl points of opposite charge, the 2D system is topologically non-trivial (like a Chern insulator) and must host protected [edge states](@article_id:142019). As we sweep $k_z$ from one Weyl point to the other, the location of this edge state traces out a line—this is precisely the Fermi arc! The Weyl points are the critical momenta where the 2D topology changes, and the Fermi arc is the surface manifestation of the topological region sandwiched between them [@problem_id:1109695]. The discovery of these strange, disjointed arcs was the smoking-gun proof that the theoretical wonderland of Weyl physics was indeed real, a new state of matter realized in a tangible crystal.
