## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Now that we have explored the inner workings of autocatalysis, the beautiful and sometimes explosive feedback loop where a product accelerates its own creation, we can ask the most exciting question of all: "What is it good for?" The answer, it turns out, is astonishingly broad. This single, simple principle—that the more you have, the more you get—echoes through some of the most practical challenges in engineering and medicine, and across to the most profound questions about our own existence. It is a unifying thread that ties together the design of a medical implant, the growth of a conductive plastic, the body's immune response, and the very origin of life on Earth.

### Engineering With and Against Autocatalysis: The World of Smart Materials

For an engineer, an accelerating, self-amplifying process is a double-edged sword. Sometimes it is a powerful tool to be
