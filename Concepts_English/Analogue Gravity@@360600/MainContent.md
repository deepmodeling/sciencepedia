## Introduction
One of the most beautiful and profound aspects of physics is its unity, where the same mathematical principles govern seemingly disparate phenomena. The field of [analogue gravity](@article_id:144376) is a prime example of this unity, leveraging accessible laboratory systems to simulate and explore the mysteries of cosmology. The extreme conditions of [astrophysical black holes](@article_id:156986) make it nearly impossible to directly test fundamental predictions like Hawking radiation. Analogue gravity addresses this gap by creating "mock" black holes on a tabletop, providing a powerful new window into the interplay between gravity and quantum mechanics.

This article will guide you through this remarkable field. First, in "Principles and Mechanisms," we will explore the core idea of how a flowing medium can create an effective curved spacetime for waves, leading to the formation of analogue event horizons and the prediction of thermal radiation. Following this, the section on "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" will survey the incredible variety of physical systems—from ultracold quantum gases and [superfluids](@article_id:180224) to laser pulses in [optical fibers](@article_id:265153)—that have been harnessed to build these black hole analogues, pushing the frontiers of [experimental physics](@article_id:264303) and theoretical understanding.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Imagine you are a fish swimming in a river. You can swim at a certain top speed. If the river flows gently, you are free to move upstream or downstream. But now, imagine the river narrows and accelerates, perhaps as it approaches a waterfall. There will be a line in the water where the river's current becomes exactly equal to your top swimming speed. If you stray across that line, no matter how hard you swim, the current will inevitably carry you over the falls. You have crossed a point of no return.

This simple, intuitive picture is the heart of [analogue gravity](@article_id:144376). By replacing the fish with a wave—a sound wave, a ripple on the surface of water, or even a light wave—and its swimming speed with the wave's propagation speed, we can create uncanny laboratory analogues of black holes and the curved spacetime of Einstein's general relativity. Let's embark on a journey to see how this remarkable analogy works, moving from the simple picture of a river to the profound physics of quantum fields in [curved space](@article_id:157539).

### The Music of Spacetime: Acoustic Metrics

The true power of this analogy was revealed when physicists realized that the mathematics describing a wave moving through a flowing medium could be reshaped into the language of general relativity. The equation for, say, a sound wave in a moving fluid looks, at first glance, like a standard wave equation. But with a clever change of perspective, it can be rewritten to describe a wave propagating in an *effective [curved spacetime](@article_id:184444)*. This spacetime isn't the real gravity of planets and stars; it's a mathematical construct, an "[acoustic metric](@article_id:198712)," whose curvature is dictated by the flow of the fluid [@problem_id:1048954].

For a fluid flowing with velocity $\vec{v}$ and having a local sound speed $c_s$, the line element of this acoustic spacetime, $ds^2$, which dictates the geometry experienced by the sound waves (phonons), takes the form:

$$
ds^2 \propto -(c_s^2 - |\vec{v}|^2) dt^2 - 2 \vec{v} \cdot d\vec{x} dt + d\vec{x} \cdot d\vec{x}
$$

Let's not be intimidated by the symbols. This equation tells a beautiful physical story. The term $d\vec{x} \cdot d\vec{x}$ is just the familiar Euclidean geometry of space. The new terms are where the magic happens. The factor $(c_s^2 - |\vec{v}|^2)$ in front of the time part, $dt^2$, shows that the flow of the fluid alters the effective "flow of time" for the sound wave. Most strikingly, the cross-term $-2 \vec{v} \cdot d\vec{x} dt$ tells us that space and time are mixed. This term signifies **frame-dragging**: the moving fluid is literally dragging the fabric of its acoustic spacetime along with it, much like a [rotating black hole](@article_id:261173) drags the spacetime around it.

The line of no return in our river analogy now has a precise mathematical meaning. It is the surface where the fluid's speed matches the wave's speed, making the coefficient of the $dt^2$ term zero (when viewed in a special way). This is the **analogue event horizon**.

### The Draining Bathtub: A Black Hole in Your Sink

To make this concrete, let’s consider a classic, tangible example: the "draining bathtub" [@problem_id:1088795]. Imagine water flowing radially into a central drain. The fluid speed increases as it gets closer to the drain, following a simple law, $v(r) = A/r$, where $r$ is the distance from the drain and $A$ is a constant measuring the strength of the sink. Now, let's consider a small ripple on the water's surface. This ripple propagates with a speed $c_s$ (which we'll assume is constant).

Far from the drain, the flow is slow ($v \ll c_s$), and the ripple can travel freely in any direction. But as it gets closer, the inward current gets stronger. There will be a [critical radius](@article_id:141937), $r_H$, where the inward flow speed exactly equals the ripple speed:

$$
v(r_H) = \frac{A}{r_H} = c_s
$$

This gives a specific location for the analogue event horizon: $r_H = A/c_s$. Any ripple that drifts inside this circle is caught in the current and inexorably pulled into the drain, unable to send a signal back out to the wider world. We have created an [acoustic black hole](@article_id:157273).

What's more, if we add a swirl to the draining water, creating a vortex, we build an analogue of a *rotating* black hole [@problem_id:890007] [@problem_id:1059266]. In this case, not only is there an event horizon, but a new region appears outside it: the **[ergosphere](@article_id:160253)**. This is a zone where the fluid's swirl speed is faster than the [wave speed](@article_id:185714). Within the ergosphere, a ripple can still escape being pulled into the drain (as it is outside the horizon), but it cannot remain stationary. It is forced to be dragged along by the vortex, a [perfect fluid](@article_id:161415) analogy for the frame-dragging effect of a spinning black hole [@problem_id:1059266].

### The Glow of the Horizon: Analogue Hawking Radiation

Black holes, both real and analogue, are more than just cosmic plugholes. They have subtle thermodynamic properties. A key property of a horizon is its **[surface gravity](@article_id:160071)**, denoted by the Greek letter kappa, $\kappa$. Intuitively, it measures the strength of the "gravitational pull" right at the edge of the horizon. In our fluid models, it is proportional to how steeply the [fluid velocity](@article_id:266826) changes as it crosses the horizon [@problem_id:1241715] [@problem_id:1048954]. For our simple draining bathtub, a careful calculation reveals a beautifully simple result for the surface gravity [@problem_id:1088795]:

$$
\kappa = \frac{c_s^3}{A}
$$

You might wonder what happens in the rotating case. Astonishingly, even with the added complexity of a swirl, the surface gravity remains the same [@problem_id:890007]! It depends only on the strength of the drain ($A$) and the speed of sound ($c_s$), not on the amount of rotation. This hints at a deep and robust property of horizons.

The true significance of surface gravity was uncovered by Stephen Hawking. He showed that due to quantum effects, black holes are not completely black. They emit a faint thermal glow, now called Hawking radiation, with a temperature directly proportional to their surface gravity:

$$
T_H = \frac{\hbar \kappa}{2\pi k_B}
$$

where $\hbar$ is Planck's constant and $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant. The analogy holds true here as well. Our [acoustic black hole](@article_id:157273) is predicted to emit a thermal spectrum of *phonons* (quanta of sound) at an **analogue Hawking temperature** determined by its acoustic [surface gravity](@article_id:160071) $\kappa$ [@problem_id:949250]. The experimental observation of this analogue Hawking radiation in various systems is one of the crowning achievements of this field, providing strong circumstantial evidence for Hawking's original, and so far astrophysically unconfirmed, prediction.

The same physics, but in reverse, can be seen in a **hydraulic jump**—the abrupt transition you see when a fast, shallow stream of water suddenly becomes deep and slow. This acts as a **[white hole](@article_id:194219) horizon**, a barrier that nothing can enter from the outside, only escape from the inside. It too has a [surface gravity](@article_id:160071) and associated thermal properties, demonstrating the generality of these horizon physics [@problem_id:1059240].

### The Universal Principle

The power of [analogue gravity](@article_id:144376) lies in its universality. The principles are not confined to fluids. Any system featuring waves propagating in a moving medium or on a non-trivial background can be a candidate.

-   In **optics**, light moving through a material with a spatially varying refractive index, $n$, can be described by an effective geometry. A carefully designed profile $n(z)$ can act like a gravitational potential, trapping or guiding light rays in a manner analogous to a particle moving in a curved spacetime [@problem_id:1058347].

-   In **condensed matter physics**, the collective excitations in [superfluids](@article_id:180224), Bose-Einstein condensates, and even electron gases can be used. Consider the charge carriers in a sheet of **graphene**. At low energies, they behave like massless particles living in a (2+1)-dimensional universe where the role of the speed of light, $c$, is played by their Fermi velocity, $v_F \approx c/300$. Now, what happens if we uniformly accelerate this graphene sheet? An observer on the sheet is accelerating through the "vacuum" of these quasiparticles. The Unruh effect states that such an observer should perceive the vacuum not as empty, but as a warm bath of particles. The temperature of this bath would be the Unruh temperature, but with the speed of light replaced by the Fermi velocity [@problem_id:437668]:

    $$
    T_{\text{eff}} = \frac{\hbar a}{2 \pi k_B v_F}
    $$

This is a profound result. It shows that the connection between acceleration, horizons, and temperature is a fundamental feature of quantum field theory, regardless of the specific "spacetime" in which it unfolds. Whether it is an astronaut accelerating in deep space, a phonon approaching a sonic horizon in a superfluid, or a quasiparticle in an accelerating piece of graphene, the underlying physics is the same. The laws of physics, it seems, have a wonderful sense of rhyme and repetition, and by studying a bathtub drain, we can hope to hear the faint, quantum whispers of a real black hole far away among the stars.
