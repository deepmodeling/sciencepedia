## Introduction
In Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, accelerating massive objects create ripples in spacetime known as gravitational waves. To fully understand these waves and the energy they carry away from an isolated system, physicists look to the "edge" of the universe—a concept known as [future null infinity](@article_id:261031). It was long assumed that at this boundary, far from any source, the symmetries of spacetime would simply mirror those of special relativity. The groundbreaking discovery in the 1960s by Bondi, van der Burg, Metzner, and Sachs revealed this to be incorrect, uncovering a vastly larger, infinite-dimensional symmetry group. This article delves into this profound structure, the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group, which has fundamentally reshaped our understanding of gravity. We will first explore the core principles and mechanisms of the BMS group, defining its unique symmetries called supertranslations. We will then journey through its far-reaching applications, discovering how this abstract symmetry provides a physical explanation for the [gravitational memory effect](@article_id:160390), offers a solution to the [black hole information paradox](@article_id:139646), and serves as a cornerstone for the modern pursuit of a holographic theory of quantum gravity.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Imagine you are standing on a lakeshore, watching a distant boat. You can’t see the boat itself, only the ripples it leaves behind. From the pattern of the waves, their size and their frequency, you could deduce a great deal about the boat—its speed, its size, perhaps even that there are two boats dancing around each other. In Einstein's universe, massive, accelerating objects like colliding black holes don't create ripples on water, but ripples in the very fabric of spacetime. These are gravitational waves.

To capture the full story of such an event, we can't just stand at one point. We need to build a "detector" that surrounds the entire system and can wait forever to catch every last ripple sent its way. In the language of general relativity, this ultimate celestial detector is a place called **[future null infinity](@article_id:261031)**, denoted by the beautiful symbol $\mathcal{I}^+$. It is the "end of the line" for all signals traveling at the speed of light, including gravitational waves. It can be pictured as a giant sphere infinitely far away, where the entire history of outgoing radiation from a system is projected, like a movie on a cosmic screen [@problem_id:1816178]. It is on this screen that the drama of gravity truly unfolds.

### The "News" that Carries Energy Away

When we watch this cosmic movie, we can ask a very simple question: is the system losing energy? For an [isolated system](@article_id:141573) like a binary star system, the total mass-energy should decrease as it radiates gravitational waves. Hermann Bondi provided a beautifully precise way to measure this. He defined the **Bondi mass**, $M_B(u)$, which is the total energy of the system as measured on our celestial screen at a specific moment of "[retarded time](@article_id:273539)" $u$. Think of $u$ as the timestamp on each frame of our cosmic movie.

Remarkably, the Bondi mass is not constant. It trickles away. What carries the energy? The answer lies in the *shape* of the gravitational waves. As a wave passes, it distorts the geometry of spacetime, stretching and squeezing it. On our [celestial sphere](@article_id:157774) $\mathcal{I}^+$, this distortion is captured by a quantity called the **[asymptotic shear](@article_id:261317)**, $C_{AB}$. It tells us how a circular pattern of test particles would be warped into an ellipse by the passing wave.

Now, if the system is quiet and not radiating, the shear is constant. The distortion pattern is frozen. But if the system is active—if our black holes are spiraling inwards—the shear changes from moment to moment. This change, this "new" information arriving at the [celestial sphere](@article_id:157774), is the key. The time-derivative of the shear is called the **[news function](@article_id:260268)**, $N_{AB} = \partial_u C_{AB}$ [@problem_id:1816192].

The name is perfect. If there is no "news," the situation is static, and no energy is radiated. If there *is* news—if the shear is changing—then energy is being carried away. The Bondi mass-loss formula, one of the gems of general relativity, makes this precise: the rate of energy loss is proportional to the square of the news integrated over the sphere. The louder the news, the faster the system loses energy. It’s an exquisitely simple and profound connection between the changing geometry of spacetime and the physical concept of energy.

### The Unexpected Symmetries of Infinity

Symmetries are the bedrock of modern physics. They tell us what remains unchanged when we change our perspective. For an [isolated system](@article_id:141573) in empty space, we expect the laws of physics to be the same if we shift our experiment in space or time, or if we rotate or boost it. These are the familiar symmetries of Einstein's special relativity, mathematically described by the Poincaré group. It was natural to assume that far away from any gravitating source, on the quiet shores of $\mathcal{I}^+$, these would be the only symmetries we would find.

But in the early 1960s, Bondi, van der Burg, Metzner, and Sachs (BMS) discovered something astonishing. The [symmetry group](@article_id:138068) of [asymptotically flat spacetime](@article_id:191521) is not the Poincaré group. It is a much larger, infinite-dimensional group, now known as the **BMS group**. It contains all the familiar Poincaré symmetries, but it also includes an infinite new class of transformations called **supertranslations**. This discovery was like an astronomer, accustomed to a handful of planets, suddenly finding an infinite swarm of new celestial bodies in the solar system.

### Supertranslations: A Time Shift for Every Direction

So, what is a supertranslation? A normal time translation is simple: you shift your origin of time, and all clocks are reset by the same amount, say, one hour. A supertranslation is an altogether stranger beast. It is a *direction-dependent* time translation. The transformation is of the form $u' = u + f(\theta, \phi)$, where $f$ is any [smooth function](@article_id:157543) on the [celestial sphere](@article_id:157774).

Imagine you are trying to synchronize clocks all over the surface of the Earth. A normal time translation corresponds to telling everyone to set their clocks forward by one hour. A supertranslation, on the other hand, is like telling the person in London to set their clock forward by 15 minutes, the person in Cairo back by 7 minutes, and the person in Tokyo forward by 42 minutes, all according to a smooth, angle-dependent rule.

This seems like a bizarre thing to do, and indeed, a supertranslation is not an exact symmetry of spacetime in the way a simple shift is. If you perform a supertranslation, the metric in the middle of spacetime changes. However, it changes in a very specific way that "fades away" as you approach [future null infinity](@article_id:261031). The essential boundary structure of $\mathcalI^+$ is preserved. They are **[asymptotic symmetries](@article_id:154909)**—symmetries of the boundary, not necessarily of the bulk [@problem_id:917460].

### The Rich Structure of the BMS Group

This infinite family of new symmetries forms a fascinating structure. The supertranslations themselves are a well-behaved, "abelian" group: performing a supertranslation $f_1$ and then $f_2$ gives the exact same result as doing them in the opposite order [@problem_id:917468].

The relationship with the old Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts), however, is much more intricate. A Lorentz transformation does not leave the set of supertranslations alone; it shuffles them. For instance, applying a boost can mix a purely angle-dependent time shift into a different, more complicated one [@problem_id:917600]. This means that the BMS group is not just "Lorentz symmetries plus supertranslations." It has a more complex, interwoven structure known as a **[semi-direct product](@article_id:188485)**. The supertranslations form an infinite foundation, and the Lorentz transformations act upon this foundation, creating a richer and more complex whole.

### The Physical Ghost of a Supertranslation

This might all sound like a mathematical curiosity, a strange property of infinity with no bearing on the real world. Nothing could be further from the truth. The existence of the BMS group has profound, observable physical consequences that challenge our deepest intuitions about gravity, space, and time.

First, supertranslations are intimately connected to a phenomenon called the **[gravitational memory effect](@article_id:160390)**. The shear, $C_{AB}$, which describes the distortion of spacetime, is not invariant under a supertranslation. A supertranslation $f$ transforms the shear according to $\sigma^{0\prime} = \sigma^0 - \frac{1}{2} \eth^2 f$, where $\sigma^0$ is the complex version of the shear and $\eth$ is a special derivative on the sphere [@problem_id:957537]. This means you can have two spacetimes, one with zero [asymptotic shear](@article_id:261317) and another with a permanent, non-zero shear, that are physically distinct yet related by a simple supertranslation. What could create such a permanent change? A burst of gravitational waves. After the waves from a binary merger pass by, they can leave behind a permanent "crease" in spacetime, a lasting memory of the event. The supertranslation is the symmetry transformation that connects the "before" state to the "after" state with this memory imprinted.

Second, supertranslations endow even the simplest objects with a surprisingly complex character. Consider a single, non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole. In the standard description, it is perfectly spherical, its mass aspect is a constant $M$ everywhere on the [celestial sphere](@article_id:157774), and its [asymptotic shear](@article_id:261317) is zero. But this is just one description. If we view the *same* black hole from a different supertranslation frame, the description changes dramatically. The black hole will appear to have a [non-uniform mass distribution](@article_id:169606) on the sphere and a non-zero shear [@problem_id:917627]. This doesn't mean the black hole itself has grown lumpy. It means the gravitational field far away carries an imprint of our choice of coordinates, a pattern of "soft hair". In fact, for every possible supertranslation function $T(\theta, \phi)$, there is a conserved physical quantity, a **supertranslation charge**, which can be measured [@problem_id:899197]. A black hole is thus decorated not just with mass, charge, and spin, but with an infinite halo of these soft charges, a holographic record written on the [celestial sphere](@article_id:157774).

Perhaps the most startling consequence concerns angular momentum. In freshman physics, we learn that the angular momentum of an isolated system is a uniquely defined, conserved quantity. The BMS group turns this cherished notion on its head. Because rotations and supertranslations do not commute, the [total angular momentum](@article_id:155254) of a radiating system becomes ambiguous. Its value depends on the supertranslation frame you use to define "a moment in time" across the [celestial sphere](@article_id:157774). Two observers, related by a supertranslation, will look at the same [binary black hole merger](@article_id:158729) and measure a different [total angular momentum](@article_id:155254) for the final system [@problem_id:1872247]. This ambiguity is not an error; it is a fundamental feature of gravity. It tells us that the state of a gravitational system cannot be fully captured by a single number for angular momentum. Instead, the information is encoded in the relationships between all the BMS charges.

The discovery of the BMS group opened a new window into the deep structure of general relativity. It revealed that spacetime, at its outer edge, is governed by a richer symphony of symmetries than anyone had expected, with profound consequences that we are only now beginning to fully appreciate, from the memory of gravitational waves to the very nature of black holes.
