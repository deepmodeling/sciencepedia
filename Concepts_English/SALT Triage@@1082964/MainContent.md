## Introduction
In the chaotic aftermath of a disaster, the fundamental rules of medicine are inverted. The focus shifts from doing everything possible for a single patient to a starkly utilitarian principle: doing the greatest good for the greatest number of people. This ethical pivot is the heart of mass casualty triage, a discipline that provides a systematic framework for making impossible decisions under extreme pressure. While older systems provided rigid rules, the complexity of real-world catastrophes revealed the need for a more dynamic and adaptable approach. This article explores the SALT (Sort, Assess, Lifesaving Interventions, Treatment/Transport) triage system, a modern evolution in disaster response. Across the following chapters, you will gain a deep understanding of its core logic and structure before exploring its profound impact on everything from battlefield medicine to modern public health policy. We begin by examining the foundational principles that allow responders to impose order on chaos and maximize survival when every second counts.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Imagine you are at the scene of a terrible train derailment. The quiet of the morning has been shattered by the shriek of metal and the cries of the injured. All around you are people in need. Your medical training screams at you to help the person right in front of you, to pour all your skill and resources into saving that one life. In normal times, this is the sacred pact of medicine. But this is not a normal time. For every person you spend thirty minutes on, three others might die from simpler, more quickly fixable problems.

The normal rules have inverted. The question is no longer, "What is best for my patient?" but rather, "Given what I have, what action saves the most lives in total?" This is the brutal, yet necessary, ethical heart of mass-casualty triage. It’s a shift from individual-focused care to a form of emergency public health, grounded in the principle of doing the **greatest good for the greatest number**. This principle forces us to think like a battlefield general, allocating scarce resources—time, personnel, equipment—where they will have the most impact.

This is not a cold-hearted calculation, but a deeply moral strategy to maximize survival in the face of overwhelming odds. A thought experiment brings this into sharp focus: imagine you have just enough resources to either perform a complex, high-risk surgery on one patient with a $10\%$ chance of survival, or to stabilize two other patients, each with a $95\%$ chance of survival if they get care. The math of "greatest good" is clear, but the decision is agonizing. The patient with the grim prognosis is not less worthy; they are simply a casualty of the catastrophic mismatch between need and supply `[@problem_id:4955781]`. The triage systems we use are designed to guide responders through these impossible choices.

### The Language of Life: Quick and Dirty Proxies

If you only have 60 seconds to decide someone's fate, you can't run a blood test or take a full set of vital signs. You need shortcuts—rapid, reliable proxies for the three things that keep a human being alive from one minute to the next: a clear **airway** for oxygen to get in, effective **breathing** to use that oxygen, and adequate **circulation** (or **perfusion**) to deliver it to the body, especially the brain.

Older triage systems like **START (Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment)** turned this into a rigid, memorable algorithm often called "30-2-Can Do" `[@problem_id:5110850]`:

*   **Respirations:** Is the rate over $30$ breaths per minute? (A sign of distress).
*   **Perfusion:** Does blood return to the nailbed in under $2$ seconds after pressing on it? (A check of circulation).
*   **Mental Status:** Can they follow a simple command? (A check of brain function).

Passing this checklist meant you were likely stable enough to wait; failing any part of it put you at the front of the line. It was fast, simple, and effective. But like any rigid system, it had its limitations. It was designed for adults and wasn't always flexible enough for the beautiful, messy chaos of a real disaster scene. This is where SALT comes in.

### SALT: A Symphony in Four Movements

The **SALT (Sort, Assess, Lifesaving Interventions, Treatment/Transport)** triage system is not just a checklist; it's a dynamic process, an elegant framework for thinking. The name itself is a guide to the four steps `[@problem_id:4974243]` `[@problem_id:4955788]`.

#### First Movement: Sort

Before touching a single victim, the first rescuer on scene performs a **global sort**. They shout two commands. First: "Everyone who can hear me and can walk, move to the green flag!" In a single breath, the least injured victims—the **Minimal** (Green)—have identified themselves and cleared the immediate area, reducing chaos.

Second: "Everyone who can't walk, wave an arm or a leg!" This second filter helps identify conscious patients who are injured but may be stable. They are likely candidates for the **Delayed** (Yellow) category.

What's left? The still, the silent. These are the victims who need assessment first. This simple, two-sentence sorting trick is incredibly powerful, allowing responders to instantly focus on the most critical patients.

#### Second Movement: Assess

Now, responders move to individual patients, starting with those who couldn't move or wave. They perform a rapid individual assessment, checking those same vital functions: breathing, perfusion, and mental status. But unlike START's rigid numbers, SALT encourages more holistic clinical judgment. Is the person in obvious respiratory distress? Do they have signs of severe bleeding? Can they make purposeful movements, even if they can't speak or follow a command? This flexibility is a key evolution `[@problem_id:5110850]`.

#### Third Movement: Lifesaving Interventions (LSIs)

Here lies another of SALT's brilliant innovations. What if, during your 60-second assessment, you see a problem you can fix in 10 seconds? SALT empowers you to act. It allows for a small, specific set of **lifesaving interventions**:

*   Controlling life-threatening bleeding with a tourniquet.
*   Opening a blocked airway by repositioning the head.
*   Placing a seal over a sucking chest wound.
*   Administering an auto-injector antidote in a chemical attack.

This small allowance acknowledges a crucial reality: sometimes the line between life and death is a simple, immediate action. SALT builds this pragmatism directly into its structure.

#### Fourth Movement: Treatment and Transport

After the assessment and any immediate LSIs, a priority is assigned. This is communicated with a colored tag—a simple, universal language for the entire disaster response system `[@problem_id:4955822]`.

*   **Red (Immediate):** These patients are the top priority. They have life-threatening injuries but a good chance of survival with immediate care. They are the ticking clocks that LSIs couldn't fully resolve.

*   **Yellow (Delayed):** These patients are seriously injured, but their condition is stable enough that they can wait for treatment without dying.

*   **Green (Minimal):** The "walking wounded." They have minor injuries and can often care for themselves or each other.

*   **Black (Deceased):** These victims show no signs of life after a basic check (like opening the airway). No resources are directed toward them.

*   **Gray (Expectant):** This is the most difficult and misunderstood category. An expectant patient is *not* dead. They are alive, but their injuries are so catastrophic (e.g., massive head trauma with brain matter visible) that survival is highly unlikely, even if they were given unlimited resources `[@problem_id:4955781]`. In the brutal calculus of a disaster, allocating scarce resources to this patient would mean denying care to several Red or Yellow patients who are salvageable. These patients are not abandoned; they are given **palliative care**—comfort, warmth, and pain relief—to allow them to die with dignity, but they are not prioritized for life-saving treatment or transport. Confusing the Black and Gray categories is a critical error; one means "no life," the other means "no hope of survival in this context."

### A Living Algorithm: Triage in the Real World

A truly robust scientific framework is not a brittle set of rules. It is a set of principles that can adapt to new information and new contexts. SALT is a living algorithm in this sense.

#### Adapting to People

What happens when you encounter a victim who is Deaf and does not respond to your spoken command to "squeeze my hand"? A rigid system might wrongly classify them as having an altered mental status. A disability-inclusive approach, fundamental to modern triage, forces the rescuer to think: "The principle is to test brain function, not hearing." The rescuer must adapt, perhaps using a written note or a visual gesture. What about a child who uses a wheelchair due to cerebral palsy? They cannot walk to the green flag. The principle is to distinguish a chronic, baseline disability from an acute, life-threatening injury `[@problem_id:4955668]`. Good triage is not about mindlessly following a flowchart; it's about intelligently applying principles to each unique human being. This adaptability extends to all ages. Children are not little adults; their baseline breathing rates are higher, and the reasons they stop breathing are often more reversible. Pediatric-specific algorithms like **JumpSTART** modify the rules, for instance by mandating five rescue breaths for an apneic child who still has a pulse, recognizing that this simple LSI has a high chance of success `[@problem_id:5134755]`.

#### Adapting to Place

The laws of physiology are universal, but their expression changes with the environment. A "normal" resting respiratory rate at sea level might be a sign of distress at an altitude of $2,500$ meters, where the air is thinner. A truly scientific triage system acknowledges this. If local data show that everyone's baseline breathing rate is shifted up by four breaths per minute due to altitude, then the cutoff for what counts as "distress" must also be shifted up to maintain the same accuracy `[@problem_id:4955798]`. This demonstrates that triage is not medical dogma; it is an evidence-based science that must be calibrated to its local context.

#### Adapting to the System

Finally, triage is not an isolated act. It is the first step in a complex, system-wide response. This means the output of triage must be a clear, unambiguous language that everyone understands. When different agencies, some using START and some using SALT, must work together, they need a harmonization plan to ensure a "Red" tag means the same thing to everyone `[@problem_id:4955760]`. Furthermore, the data collected on each triage tag—a unique ID number, the priority category, the time, the location—is not just paperwork. It is the minimum essential data set that feeds the brain of the entire operation, allowing incident command to track patients, manage resources, and maintain situational awareness `[@problem_id:4955695]`.

From the foundational ethical dilemma to the on-the-ground assessment, and all the way to system-wide data management, the principles of SALT triage reveal a beautiful unity. It is a system designed to impose order on chaos, to make the most compassionate choices possible under the worst imaginable circumstances, and ultimately, to save the greatest number of lives.
