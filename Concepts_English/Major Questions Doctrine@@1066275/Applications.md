## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Have you ever wondered who writes the rules that shape our world? We often think of laws as being passed by Congress, but a vast number of regulations that affect our daily lives—from the air we breathe and the food we eat to the safety of our cars and workplaces—are written by federal agencies. These agencies, staffed by experts, are given power by Congress to "fill in the details" of our laws. But a fascinating and profound question arises: what happens when a "detail" is so large it changes the entire picture? What happens when an agency, in trying to execute a law, makes a decision of such vast economic and political importance that it reshapes a whole sector of our society?

This is not an abstract philosophical puzzle. It is one of the most vital questions in modern governance, and the judiciary's answer is a principle we call the "major questions doctrine." This doctrine is not merely a legal technicality; it is a lens through which we can understand the very architecture of power in a democracy. It acts as a constitutional guardrail, ensuring that the most consequential decisions are made by our elected representatives in Congress, not by unelected officials in the executive branch. Let us take a journey through several fields, primarily in the world of healthcare, to see how this single, elegant principle brings clarity to complex and contentious issues.

### Public Health in the Balance: The Pandemic and the Limits of Power

No recent event has thrown the power of federal agencies into sharper relief than the COVID-19 pandemic. In the face of a national crisis, agencies took dramatic actions to protect public health. Yet these actions sparked a fundamental debate, not about the goals, but about the authority to achieve them.

Consider a nationwide halt on residential evictions. Public health experts might argue, quite plausibly, that preventing evictions keeps people from crowding into shelters or shared housing, thus slowing the spread of a virus. But does the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), acting under a general public health statute from the 1940s, have the power to suspend millions of rental contracts across the country? This is the very definition of a "major question." To do so would affect nearly every landlord and tenant in the nation, with staggering economic consequences. The major questions doctrine forces us to ask: did Congress, when it gave the CDC the power to "make and enforce regulations necessary to prevent the...spread of communicable diseases," truly intend to grant it the power to remake the national housing market? The doctrine suggests that if Congress wants to delegate such a monumental power, it must say so clearly and explicitly. It cannot be assumed to have hidden such an elephant in a statutory mousehole ([@problem_id:4477703]). The same logic applies to other sweeping mandates, such as a hypothetical rule requiring universal masking in all indoor public spaces nationwide ([@problem_id:4477497]).

This principle, however, has nuanced boundaries. The source of the government's power matters immensely. Imagine two different scenarios for a mask mandate in healthcare settings. In the first, the CDC issues a blanket order requiring masks in *every* healthcare facility in the country, public or private. This would be a direct exercise of regulatory power over the entire population, and like the eviction moratorium, it would face a steep challenge under the major questions doctrine.

Now, consider a second scenario. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that runs Medicare and Medicaid, issues a rule stating that it will only pay for services at hospitals and clinics that require masks. This is a different kind of power. Here, the government is not acting as a national police officer but as a market participant. It is setting the conditions under which it will spend its money. Because participation in Medicare and Medicaid is technically voluntary (though practically indispensable for most facilities), this is seen as an exercise of Congress's Spending Power. Courts are much less likely to see this as a "major question" because the agency is acting within its traditional role of managing its own massive healthcare programs to ensure patient safety ([@problem_id:4471157]). The doctrine thus helps us distinguish between the government's power to regulate everyone and its power to set the terms of its own contracts.

### The Doctor's Office and the Bureaucrat's Pen

The reach of the major questions doctrine extends from broad public mandates into the very heart of the healthcare system—the relationship between a doctor and a patient. What happens when an agency, citing a general goal like "efficiency" or "quality," begins to dictate the specifics of medical care for millions?

Suppose a federal agency, tasked with the "efficient administration" of Medicare, decides to impose a nationwide quota on the number of "non-urgent" elective surgeries hospitals can perform. This is, in effect, a form of healthcare rationing. The decision to delay a person's knee replacement or cataract surgery is a deeply significant one, both personally and economically. Is such a transformative power truly contained within a general administrative clause? The major questions doctrine provides a framework for saying no. It insists that decisions of this magnitude—essentially redesigning who gets what care and when—belong to Congress ([@problem_id:4477675]).

The intrusion can become even more specific. Imagine an agency mandating that every hospital in the country use a single, named, proprietary software algorithm to diagnose a condition like sepsis. The economic significance is vast—it would force an entire industry to purchase a specific product, creating a monopoly by regulatory decree. The political significance is also profound, as it represents a deep federal intervention into the clinical judgment of physicians. This is not merely setting a quality standard (e.g., reducing sepsis mortality); it is dictating the precise tools and methods of medical practice. The doctrine serves as a crucial check on an agency's ability to take over such a core function of a profession without an unmistakable command from Congress ([@problem_id:4394143]).

Even in a declared emergency, an agency's power is not limitless. An agency might be granted the authority to "waive or modify" certain rules to provide flexibility during a crisis. But does the power to "modify" include the power to completely transform? For instance, could an emergency waiver be used to unilaterally shift the entire Medicare system from a fee-for-service model to a completely different capitated payment system? The doctrine teaches us to read these words carefully. "To modify" is to adjust, not to revolutionize. A sweeping, nationwide restructuring of the healthcare payment system is a major question that requires a much clearer grant of authority than a general power to make minor adjustments during an emergency ([@problem_id:4471121]).

### From the Clinic to the Statehouse

The principles illuminated by the major questions doctrine ripple out into many other areas of our society, often highlighting the delicate balance between federal and state power.

Consider a rule requiring all employers to provide paid sick leave. A state government can generally enact such a law under its broad, inherent "police power" to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens. But if a *federal agency* tried to issue the same rule nationwide, relying on a general statute about controlling disease, it would immediately raise a major question. Imposing a new, national labor standard on every employer is a decision of immense economic and political consequence. The doctrine would demand a clear statement from Congress authorizing this specific action ([@problem_id:4477559]). This illustrates a key aspect of American federalism: states have broad inherent powers, while federal agencies have only the powers delegated to them by Congress, a delegation the doctrine requires to be crystal clear for the biggest issues.

This same logic extends to some of the most politically charged issues of our time. When the FDA modifies the dispensing rules for a medication used in abortion, for instance, it is acting in an area of intense political and social debate. A state may have its own laws governing access to that medication. The FDA's action, while seemingly technical, has vast political significance. The major questions doctrine becomes a key part of the legal analysis, forcing a court to scrutinize whether Congress clearly authorized the agency to make such a consequential decision that intersects with one of the nation's most divisive topics ([@problem_id:4493162]).

### A Conversation About Power

Ultimately, the major questions doctrine is far more than a rule of statutory interpretation. It is the framework for a continuous conversation about power and accountability in a representative democracy. It ensures that the most transformative decisions—those that reshape our economy, intrude into our personal lives, and define the very nature of our social arrangements—are made in the open, through the deliberative and often difficult process of legislation.

It forces the grandest questions of public policy out of the quiet, expert-filled corridors of administrative agencies and into the chamber of Congress. By demanding that our elected representatives take responsibility for the biggest choices, the doctrine reinforces a foundational principle: that in a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, the authority to paint the broadest strokes on the canvas of our society must belong to those we choose to hold the brush.
