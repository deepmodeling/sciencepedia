## Introduction
In the familiar world of tort law, harm is typically a tangible injury and the remedy is straightforward compensation. But what happens when the alleged harm is not an injury to a person, but the very creation of a person under circumstances the parents sought to avoid? This is the complex and ethically charged domain of reproductive torts, a legal field that grapples with the consequences of medical negligence at the very beginning of life. As reproductive technologies advance at a breathtaking pace, courts are increasingly forced to answer profound questions about choice, autonomy, and the legal meaning of harm, pushing the boundaries of traditional legal reasoning.

This article provides a comprehensive exploration of this fascinating area of law. The first section, **Principles and Mechanisms**, will dissect the foundational legal doctrines. We will explore the parents' claim of "wrongful birth," which centers on the loss of informed consent, and contrast it with the child's paradoxical and often-rejected claim of "wrongful life." The second section, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, will move from theory to practice. We will examine how these principles are applied in modern fertility clinics, challenged by new technologies like [gene editing](@entry_id:147682), and how they intersect with contentious social debates surrounding abortion, disability rights, and the legal status of an embryo.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Imagine a simple case of harm. A surgeon, through a moment of carelessness, leaves a surgical sponge inside a patient. The law’s response is straightforward: the surgeon had a duty of care, breached it, and caused a clear, measurable injury. The remedy is to compensate the patient, to make them whole again. This is the familiar landscape of negligence law.

But what happens when the "harm" in question is not a wound, but the creation of a life? What if the negligence doesn't cause an injury *to* a person, but results in the very *existence* of a person under circumstances the parents sought to avoid? Here, the neat and tidy rules of tort law enter a fascinating and deeply philosophical realm. We are forced to ask questions that touch the very core of what it means to be a person, to make a choice, and to suffer a harm. This is the world of reproductive torts, a legal frontier where courts must navigate a maze of ethics, technology, and profound human values.

### The Parents' Story: Wrongful Birth and the Right to Choose

Let's begin with the most legally straightforward, though emotionally complex, of these claims: **wrongful birth**. This is a claim brought by parents against a healthcare provider. The story is not, as the name might misleadingly suggest, that the child's birth was "wrong." Rather, the story is that the parents were deprived of their fundamental right to make an informed choice. [@problem_id:4517925]

At the heart of modern medicine is the principle of **informed consent**. Your doctor has a duty not just to treat you competently, but to give you the information you need to be the captain of your own ship. This duty is magnified in [reproductive medicine](@entry_id:268052), where decisions about whether to conceive, to carry a pregnancy to term, or to use reproductive technologies are intensely personal. The law recognizes a protected sphere of **reproductive autonomy**, a value conceptually aligned with constitutional rights to privacy, which allows individuals to make these foundational choices for themselves. [@problem_id:4517925]

A wrongful birth claim arises when a physician's negligence shatters this autonomy. Imagine a doctor negligently misreads a [genetic screening](@entry_id:272164) and fails to inform parents of a high risk for a severe congenital disorder. The parents, relying on the faulty all-clear, continue a pregnancy they otherwise might have chosen to terminate. [@problem_id:4511797] The physician has breached their duty to inform. The causation is clear: but for the bad information, the parents would have made a different choice.

But what is the legal injury? Here, the law performs an elegant maneuver to avoid a philosophical quagmire. The injury is not the child. The injury is twofold, and it belongs entirely to the parents:
1.  The infringement on their autonomy—their right to make a fully informed decision was taken from them.
2.  The imposition of **extraordinary economic costs** associated with raising a child with significant disabilities. These are the quantifiable, tangible costs for specialized medical care, therapies, and educational services that they would have lawfully chosen to avoid. [@problem_id:4479861]

This framing is crucial because it allows the law to provide a remedy without devaluing the life of the child. The lawsuit is not a statement that a life with disability is worth less; it is a statement that a physician’s negligence imposed a foreseeable financial burden on the parents. [@problem_id:4517898] By focusing the harm on the parents' financial and decisional interests, the court can compensate a real injury without making any judgment on the value of the child's life.

This is distinct from a **wrongful conception** (or **wrongful pregnancy**) claim, which might arise from a negligently performed sterilization that results in the birth of a *healthy* child. In those cases, many courts apply a "benefits rule," reasoning that the unexpected financial costs of raising a healthy child are offset by the intangible joys and benefits of parenthood, often limiting damages to the costs of the pregnancy and birth. [@problem_id:4493958] This contrast highlights that the core of a wrongful birth claim is about compensating for the *extraordinary* and foreseeable costs directly linked to the child's impairment, a direct consequence of the physician's failure to inform.

### The Child's Paradox: Wrongful Life and the Problem of Nonexistence

Now, let us turn to the child's perspective. If the parents can sue, can the child? This leads us to the mind-bending claim of **wrongful life**. Here, the child, through a guardian, becomes the plaintiff. The argument is as radical as it is profound: "Because of your negligence, I was brought into existence to suffer a life of impairment. It would have been better if I had never been born at all." [@problem_id:4493958]

For most courts, this claim runs into two insurmountable walls.

The first is the problem of **cognizable harm**. The law is profoundly reluctant to declare that for a living person, nonexistence would be a preferable state. To recognize "life with impairments" as a legal injury would require a court to assign a negative value to that person's existence, a philosophical and moral judgment that is seen as beyond the competence of the legal system. The law, in its essence, sees life as a fundamental good, not a compensable harm. [@problem_id:4511797]

The second wall is the problem of **damages**. Compensatory damages are meant to restore a person to the position they would have been in *but for* the negligence. For a child in a wrongful life case, that position is nonexistence. To calculate the damages, a court would have to subtract the value of nonexistence from the value of a life with impairments. This is a logically impossible calculation. You cannot put a number on nothingness. [@problem_to_id:4479861]

Because of these profound logical hurdles, the vast majority of jurisdictions reject wrongful life claims for general damages (i.e., pain and suffering for being alive). The duty of the physician was to the parents, the decision-makers, not to a potential, non-existent person to prevent their own birth. [@problem_id:4517908]

Yet, the ethical principle of **non-maleficence**—the duty to do no harm—tugs at our conscience. A clear act of negligence has resulted in a child facing a lifetime of expensive medical needs. In a stunning display of legal creativity, a minority of jurisdictions have found a narrow path forward. They continue to reject damages for the "harm" of living, but they allow the child to recover **special damages** for the extraordinary medical and care costs they will incur throughout their life. [@problem_id:4517885] This reframes the child's injury in a brilliant way. The harm is not "being born," but "being born with foreseeable, costly needs *without the financial resources to meet them*." This provides for the child's welfare, holding the negligent party accountable for a tangible economic loss, all without ever having to make the impossible judgment that the child's life is a harm in itself. [@problem_id:4514093]

### A Tale of Two Harms: Prenatal Injury vs. Wrongful Life

To truly appreciate the delicate logic at play, consider a child born with two separate conditions. The first is a genetic disorder that a doctor negligently failed to disclose to the parents. The second is a distinct organ injury caused by a medication the doctor negligently prescribed during the pregnancy. [@problem_id:4517910]

The child might bring a (likely unsuccessful) wrongful life claim related to the genetic disorder. But for the organ injury, the child can bring a **prenatal injury** claim. This claim is universally recognized. Why the difference?

It all comes down to the baseline for comparison. In the prenatal injury claim, the doctor's negligence (prescribing the wrong drug) made the child's life *worse than it otherwise would have been*. The baseline for measuring harm is a hypothetical version of that same child—with the genetic disorder, but *without* the organ damage. This is a coherent and measurable comparison.

In the wrongful life claim, the negligence didn't make the child's life worse; it *resulted in* the child's life. The baseline is nonexistence. The law can compare an injured state to a healthier state, but it cannot compare any state to a state of nothingness. This clear distinction reveals the beautiful internal logic that guides this area of law. [@problem_id:4517908]

### The Modern Frontier: When Technology Blurs the Lines

Our journey does not end here, because technology is constantly creating new ways for reproduction to go awry. Consider the world of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART). In a case of **wrongful fertilization**, an IVF clinic makes a devastating error—it uses the wrong sperm or implants the wrong embryo. [@problem_id:4517939]

A healthy child may be born, but the parents sue. What is the harm? It is not the financial burden of a disability. The harm is a profound violation of **procreative intent and genetic lineage**. The parents have been deprived of the child they planned for and created, and are now raising a child to whom one or both may not be genetically related. This is a new kind of injury to parental autonomy, a stark reminder that as our power to shape the creation of life grows, so too does the law’s challenge to define the duties, and the harms, that come with it.
