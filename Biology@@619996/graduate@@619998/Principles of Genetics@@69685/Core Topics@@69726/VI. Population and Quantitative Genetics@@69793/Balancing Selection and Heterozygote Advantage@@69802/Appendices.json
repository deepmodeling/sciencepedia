The resistance is determined by a single gene locus with two alleles: a resistance allele `R` and a susceptible allele `r`. The population is large, and mating is random. After several generations of consistent herbicide application across the fields, the population has reached a stable state. Field biologists have measured the relative fitness of the three possible genotypes in this herbicide-treated environment. The relative fitness values are as follows:\n\n-   Homozygous resistant (`RR`): $w_{RR} = 0.85$\n-   Heterozygous (`Rr`): $w_{Rr} = 1.00$\n-   Homozygous susceptible (`rr`): $w_{rr} = 0.20$\n\nCalculate the predicted frequency of the resistance allele, `R`, in this population at equilibrium.

The equilibrium allele frequencies can be determined using the selection coefficients against each of the homozygous genotypes.\n\nThe selection coefficient, $s$, measures the fitness reduction of a genotype relative to the most fit genotype. By convention, the fitness of the most advantageous genotype is set to 1. In this case, $w_{Rr} = 1.00$.

All necessary parameters and conditions are provided for a unique derivation. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nLet $p$ be the frequency of the allele $A$ and $q$ be the frequency of the allele $a$. In a two-allele system, the allele frequencies must sum to unity, so $p+q=1$. The problem specifies that zygote genotypes are in Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) before selection. The frequencies of the genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ are therefore $p^2$, $2pq$, and $q^2$, respectively.\n\nThe relative viabilities are given as $w_{AA}=1-s$, $w_{Aa}=1$, and $w_{aa}=1-t$. The conditions $0<s<1$ and $0<t<1$ define heterozygote advantage, or overdominance, where the heterozygote has the highest fitness.\n\nThe mean fitness of the population, $\\bar{w}$, is the average of the genotype viabilities weighted by their frequencies in the zygote pool:\n$$ \\bar{w} = p^2 w_{AA} + 2pq w_{Aa} + q^2 w_{aa} $$\nSubstituting the given expressions for the viabilities, we have:\n$$ \\bar{w} = p^2(1-s) + 2pq(1) + q^2(1-t) $$\nThis expression can be simplified by substituting $q=1-p$ and rearranging a more compact form dependent only on $p$:\n$$ \\bar{w}(p) = p^2(1-s) + 2p(1-p) + (1-p)^2(1-t) $$\n$$ \\bar{w}(p) = p^2 - sp^2 + 2p - 2p^2 + 1 - 2p + p^2 - t(1-2p+p^2) $$\n$$ \\bar{w}(p) = 1 - sp^2 - t(1-p)^2 $$\n\nA stable internal equilibrium allele frequency, denoted $p^*$, is achieved when the mean fitness of the population $\\bar{w}$ is maximized.

The load is a direct consequence of producing less-fit homozygous individuals from the random mating of heterozygotes. The magnitude of the load is a function of the selection coefficients against both homozygotes; it increases as $s$ and $t$ increase. If selection against either homozygote is absent (e.g., $s=0$ or $t=0$), the load disappears as the population becomes monomorphic for the favored allele.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{st}{s+t}}\n$$", "id": "2792287"}]}
