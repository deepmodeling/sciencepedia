The dynamics of linkage disequilibrium under this cycle are described by a recurrence relation. The change in $D_t$ per generation is the sum of the change due to recombination and the change due to selection.\nRecombination breaks down existing disequilibrium at a rate proportional to the recombination fraction $r$. This contributes a term $-r D_t$ to the change $\\Delta D_t$.\nThe problem specifies that selection introduces a constant \"per-generation selection-induced term\" equal to the result from Part 1, $\\Delta D_{\\mathrm{sel}}$. This term represents the new LD generated by selection in each generation.\nThis leads to the standard linear recurrence relation:\n$$\nD_{t+1} = D_t - rD_t + \\Delta D_{\\mathrm{sel}} = (1-r)D_t + \\Delta D_{\\mathrm{sel}}\n$$\nThis is a first-order, non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. We can solve it given the initial condition $D_0=0$.\nThe equilibrium solution, $\\hat{D}$, is found by setting $D_{t+1}=D_t=\\hat{D}$:\n$$\n\\hat{D} = (1-r)\\hat{D} + \\Delta D_{\\mathrm{sel}} \\implies r\\hat{D} = \\Delta D_{\\mathrm{sel}} \\implies \\hat{D} = \\frac{\\Delta D_{\\mathrm{sel}}}{r}\n$$\nThe general solution is of the form $D_t = A(1-r)^t + \\hat{D}$. We find the constant $A$ using the initial condition $D_0=0$:\n$$\nD_0 = 0 = A(1-r)^0 + \\hat{D} \\implies A = -\\hat{D}\n$$\nSubstituting $A$ and $\\hat{D}$ back, we obtain the solution for $D_t$:\n$$\nD_t = \\hat{D} - \\hat{D}(1-r)^t = \\hat{D}(1 - (1-r)^t) = \\frac{\\Delta D_{\\mathrm{sel}}}{r} (1 - (1-r)^t)\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $\\Delta D_{\\mathrm{sel}}$ derived in Part 1:\n$$\nD_t = \\frac{1}{r} \\left(-\\frac{\\alpha\\beta p_A q_A p_B q_B}{V_S}\\right) (1-(1-r)^t)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the linkage disequilibrium after $t$ generations. It shows how LD builds up from zero towards an equilibrium value determined by the balance between generation by selective epistasis and decay by recombination.\n$$\nD_t = -\\frac{\\alpha\\beta p_A q_A p_B q_B}{rV_S}\\left(1 - (1-r)^t\\right)\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{\\alpha \\beta p_{A} q_{A} p_{B} q_{B}}{r V_{S}}(1 - (1-r)^{t})}\n$$", "id": "2830795"}]}
