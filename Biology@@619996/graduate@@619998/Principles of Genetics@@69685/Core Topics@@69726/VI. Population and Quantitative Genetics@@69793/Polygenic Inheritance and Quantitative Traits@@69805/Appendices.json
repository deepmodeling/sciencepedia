It represents a standard exercise in quantitative genetics based on established principles. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe correlation between the phenotypes of two individuals, denoted $1$ and $2$, is defined as:\n$$\nr = \\text{Corr}(P_{1}, P_{2}) = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(P_{1}, P_{2})}{\\sqrt{V(P_{1})V(P_{2})}}\n$$\nThe problem states that the population is at equilibrium, so all individuals have the same phenotypic variance, $V_{P}$. Further, this variance has been standardized to $V_{P} = 1$. Therefore, the correlation simplifies to the covariance:\n$$\nr = \\text{Cov}(P_{1}, P_{2})\n$$\nThe phenotype $P$ is given by the linear model $P = A + D + E$, where $A$ is the additive genetic value, $D$ is the dominance deviation, and $E$ is the environmental deviation. The covariance between the phenotypes of two relatives is:\n$$\n\\text{Cov}(P_{1}, P_{2}) = \\text{Cov}(A_{1} + D_{1} + E_{1}, A_{2} + D_{2} + E_{2})\n$$\nExpanding this using the properties of covariance yields:\n$$\n\\text{Cov}(P_{1}, P_{2}) = \\text{Cov}(A_{1}, A_{2}) + \\text{Cov}(D_{1}, D_{2}) + \\text{Cov}(E_{1}, E_{2}) + \\text{Cov}(A_{1}, D_{2}) + \\text{Cov}(A_{2}, D_{1}) + \\text{Cov}(A_{1}, E_{2}) + \\text{Cov}(A_{2}, E_{1}) + \\text{Cov}(D_{1}, E_{2}) + \\text{Cov}(D_{2}, E_{1})\n$$\nWe evaluate the cross-terms based on the problem's premises:\n1.  Environmental deviations $E$ are independent across individuals, so $\\text{Cov}(E_{1}, E_{2}) = 0$.\n2.  Environmental deviations are uncorrelated with genotype, which implies they are uncorrelated with the genotypic components $A$ and $D$. Thus, all $\\text{Cov}(A, E)$ and $\\text{Cov}(D, E)$ terms are zero.\n3.  In a randomly mating population at Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium, the additive genetic value and the dominance deviation are uncorrelated. This holds both within and between individuals, thus $\\text{Cov}(A_{1}, D_{2}) = 0$ and $\\text{Cov}(A_{2}, D_{1}) = 0$.\n\nConsequently, the phenotypic covariance simplifies to the sum of the genetic covariances:\n$$\n\\text{Cov}(P_{1}, P_{2}) = \\text{Cov}(A_{1}, A_{2}) + \\text{Cov}(D_{1}, D_{2})\n$$\nOur task reduces to deriving these two genetic covariance terms for full siblings and half-siblings using first principles of identity-by-descent (IBD).\n\nThe genetic covariance between two relatives is a function of the population's genetic variances ($V_{A}$ and $V_{D}$) and the probabilities of sharing alleles IBD. Let us define two key coefficients for a pair of individuals:\n- The coefficient of coancestry, $\\theta_{12}$, is the probability that a randomly chosen allele from individual $1$ at a locus is IBD to a randomly chosen allele from individual $2$ at the same locus.\n- The coefficient of fraternity, $\\Delta_{12}$, is the probability that the two individuals share both of their alleles IBD at a locus (i.e., their genotypes are IBD).\n\nThe covariance of additive values is $\\text{Cov}(A_{1}, A_{2}) = 2\\theta_{12}V_{A}$. This arises because the additive value $A$ is a sum of individual allele effects. The covariance between the additive values of two relatives is proportional to the probability that their alleles are IBD. Specifically, for a single locus, $A = g_{m} + g_{p}$, where $g$ represents the additive effect of an allele. $\\text{Cov}(A_1, A_2) = \\text{Cov}(g_{1m}+g_{1p}, g_{2m}+g_{2p}) = 4\\theta_{12}\\text{Var}(g)$. Since $V_{A,locus} = 2\\text{Var}(g)$ under random mating, this gives $\\text{Cov}(A_1, A_2) = 2\\theta_{12}V_{A,locus}$. Summing over all unlinked loci yields the total covariance.\n\nThe covariance of dominance deviations is $\\text{Cov}(D_{1}, D_{2}) = \\Delta_{12}V_{D}$. The dominance deviation $D$ is a property of the diploid genotype (the interaction between two alleles at a locus). The covariance $\\text{Cov}(D_{1}, D_{2}) = \\mathbb{E}[D_{1}D_{2}]$ (since $\\mathbb{E}[D]=0$) is non-zero only if the genotypes of the two individuals are correlated. This correlation is due to IBD. The expectation $\\mathbb{E}[D_{1}D_{2}]$ equals $V_{D}$ if the genotypes are IBD (with probability $\\Delta_{12}$) and is zero otherwise (assuming random mating). Thus, the covariance is precisely $\\Delta_{12}V_{D}$.\n\nNow, we compute $\\theta$ and $\\Delta$ for the specified relationships.\n\n**Full Siblings (FS)**\nFull siblings share both parents, a father (F) and a mother (M), who are non-inbred and unrelated. Let the IBD state be described by $k_{i}$, the probability of sharing $i$ alleles IBD at a locus.\n- The probability of sharing two alleles IBD ($k_{2}$) requires inheriting the same paternal allele (probability $1/2$) AND the same maternal allele (probability $1/2$). These are independent events. Thus, $\\Delta_{FS} = k_{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n- The probability of sharing zero alleles IBD ($k_{0}$) requires inheriting different paternal alleles ($1/2$) AND different maternal alleles ($1/2$). Thus, $k_{0} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n- The probability of sharing one allele IBD is $k_{1} = 1 - k_{0} - k_{2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe coefficient of coancestry is derived from these probabilities: $\\theta_{FS} = \\frac{1}{4}k_{1} + \\frac{1}{2}k_{2} = \\frac{1}{4}(\\frac{1}{2}) + \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{4}) = \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThe phenotypic correlation for full-siblings is:\n$$\nr_{FS} = \\text{Cov}(P_{1}, P_{2}) = 2\\theta_{FS}V_{A} + \\Delta_{FS}V_{D} = 2(\\frac{1}{4})V_{A} + \\frac{1}{4}V_{D} = \\frac{1}{2}V_{A} + \\frac{1}{4}V_{D}\n$$\n\n**Paternal Half-Siblings (HS)**\nPaternal half-siblings share a common father (F) but have different, unrelated mothers.\n- It is impossible for them to share two alleles IBD, as they only have one parent in common. Thus, $\\Delta_{HS} = k_{2} = 0$.\n- They share one allele IBD if they inherit the same allele from their common father. The probability of this is $k_{1} = 1/2$.\n- They share zero alleles IBD if they inherit different alleles from their common father, with probability $k_{0} = 1/2$.\nThe coefficient of coancestry is: $\\theta_{HS} = \\frac{1}{4}k_{1} + \\frac{1}{2}k_{2} = \\frac{1}{4}(\\frac{1}{2}) + \\frac{1}{2}(0) = \\frac{1}{8}$.\nThe phenotypic correlation for half-siblings is:\n$$\nr_{HS} = \\text{Cov}(P_{1}, P_{2}) = 2\\theta_{HS}V_{A} + \\Delta_{HS}V_{D} = 2(\\frac{1}{8})V_{A} + (0)V_{D} = \\frac{1}{4}V_{A}\n$$\n\n**Contribution of Dominance**\nThe derived correlations are $r_{FS} = \\frac{1}{2}V_{A} + \\frac{1}{4}V_{D}$ and $r_{HS} = \\frac{1}{4}V_{A}$. A comparison reveals the role of dominance. The correlation between half-siblings depends only on the additive genetic variance $V_{A}$. This is because they cannot share a diploid genotype IBD ($\\Delta_{HS} = 0$), so the component of variance arising from allelic interaction within loci ($V_{D}$) does not contribute to their resemblance. In contrast, full siblings have a $1/4$ probability of sharing the same genotype IBD ($\\Delta_{FS} = 1/4$). This allows the dominance effects to contribute to their similarity, inflating their correlation by an amount $\\frac{1}{4}V_{D}$. The full sibling correlation is not merely double the half-sibling correlation (which it would be if only additive effects existed, as $2\\theta_{FS} = 2(2\\theta_{HS})$); it is greater than double by this dominance term. This excess similarity between full siblings is a classic signature of non-additive genetic variance, specifically dominance variance, in a randomly mating population.\n\nThe final results are presented as a row matrix as requested.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2}V_{A} + \\frac{1}{4}V_{D} & \\frac{1}{4}V_{A} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2838200"}, {"introduction": "A central goal of quantitative genetics is not just to describe variation but to predict how it changes.

This quantity is known as the response to selection, denoted by $R$.\n\nLet $\\mu_P$ and $\\mu_A$ be the mean phenotype and mean additive genetic (breeding) value, respectively, of the population in the parental generation before selection. Without loss of generality, we can measure all traits as deviations from their initial mean, such that $\\mu_P = 0$ and $\\mu_A = 0$. The phenotypic model is $P = A + E$, where $P$ is the phenotype, $A$ is the breeding value, and $E$ is the environmental deviation. Taking the expectation gives $\\mu_P = \\mu_A + \\mu_E$. With our convention, this implies $\\mu_E=0$.\n\nSelection is performed on the phenotype $P$. Let the group of selected parents be denoted by the subscript $S$.

This relationship can be derived from the principles of linear regression.\n\nWe wish to predict an individual's breeding value, $A$, based on their phenotype, $P$. The linear regression of $A$ on $P$ gives the best linear prediction of $A$ from $P$. The regression equation is:\n$$E[A | P] - \\mu_A = b_{A,P} (P - \\mu_P)$$\nwhere $b_{A,P}$ is the regression coefficient of $A$ on $P$. Using our convention that initial means are zero, this simplifies to $E[A|P] = b_{A,P} P$.\n\nThe regression coefficient $b_{A,P}$ is defined as:\n$$b_{A,P} = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(A, P)}{\\operatorname{Var}(P)}$$\nThe problem provides the model $P = A + E$ with $\\operatorname{Cov}(A, E) = 0$.

So, $b_{A,P} = h^2$.\n\nThe regression equation is therefore $E[A|P] = h^2 P$. This relationship between the expected breeding value and the phenotype also holds for the means of any subgroup of the population.

[@problem_id:2838178]", "problem": "A continuous trait in a wild vertebrate is measured in both parents and their offspring. Assume the standard quantitative genetic decomposition $P = A + D + I + E$, where $P$ is the phenotype, $A$ is the additive genetic value, $D$ is dominance, $I$ is epistasis, and $E$ is the environmental deviation. Define narrow-sense heritability as $h^2 = V_A / V_P$, where $V_A$ is the additive genetic variance and $V_P$ is the phenotypic variance. You wish to estimate $h^2$ using the regression of offspring phenotype on a single parentâ€™s phenotype in a natural setting where parents and offspring may share environments. Let $C_{EP,EO} = \\mathrm{Cov}(E_{\\text{parent}}, E_{\\text{offspring}})$ denote the covariance of environmental deviations shared by a genetic parent and its offspring.\n\nFrom first principles, reason about how shared environmental covariance between parents and offspring affects the expected slope of the parentâ€“offspring regression and hence biases the estimate of $h^2$. Then, identify a concrete cross-fostering design that, in expectation, eliminates this bias while remaining feasible in a field study. Consider practical issues such as the timing of foster assignment, reciprocity, blocking, and prenatal maternal effects.\n\nWhich option most accurately describes both the direction and algebraic form of the bias and proposes an appropriate cross-fostering design that removes it?\n\nA. In the single-parent regression, the expected slope equals $\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2} V_A + C_{EP,EO}\\right) / V_P$, so $C_{EP,EO} > 0$ inflates and $C_{EP,EO} < 0$ deflates the estimate relative to the additive genetic expectation. A bias-eliminating design is complete reciprocal cross-fostering: at birth (or hatching), randomly exchange entire split-litters or split-clutches among unrelated nests within spatiotemporal blocks, equalize brood sizes, and assign each genetic familyâ€™s offspring to multiple foster parents; for oviparous species, perform split-clutch cross-fostering pre-incubation, or for viviparous species, use embryo transfer where feasible, to sever prenatal maternal environmental covariance. Randomization ensures $C_{EP,EO} = 0$ in expectation for genetic parentâ€“offspring pairs, yielding an unbiased regression; mid-parent regression under this design targets $h^2$.\n\nB. Parental and offspring shared environments necessarily reduce the regression slope because of regression to the mean, so $C_{EP,EO} > 0$ deflates the estimate. Cross-fostering within families (swapping siblings between full-sib litters only) suffices, since siblings have similar genotypes and thus environmental similarity will average out without breaking the geneticâ€“environment correlation.\n\nC. The bias in the single-parent regression is $C_{EP,EO} / V_A$, so it does not depend on $V_P$. Eliminating the bias does not require cross-fostering; instead, include measured environmental covariates as fixed effects in a regression of offspring on parent. This guarantees that $C_{EP,EO} = 0$ even for unmeasured environmental components.\n\nD. Using the mid-parent as the predictor removes environmental bias because averaging two parents cancels environmental effects. Therefore, the mid-parent slope equals $h^2$ regardless of $C_{EP,EO}$, and no cross-fostering is necessary as long as mating is random.\n\nE. The parentâ€“offspring slope is biased only by dominance variance $V_D$ and not by shared environments, because environmental deviations are independent by definition.

The model $P = A + D + I + E$ and the definition of narrow-sense heritability are canonical. The question addresses a fundamental challenge in estimating heritability from pedigree data in natural populations: the confounding of genetic and environmental influences. The concept of using parent-offspring regression to estimate $h^2$ and the problem of shared environmental covariance ($C_{EP,EO}$) are central topics in evolutionary genetics. The prompt to consider cross-fostering as an experimental solution is appropriate and standard. The problem statement has no scientific or logical flaws. It is not ill-posed, ambiguous, or based on false premises.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the derivation and evaluation of the options.\n\n### Derivation of the Parent-Offspring Regression Slope and Bias\nThe slope, $b_{O,P}$, of the linear regression of offspring phenotype ($P_O$) on a single parent's phenotype ($P_P$) is given by the formula:\n$$b_{O,P} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(P_P, P_O)}{\\mathrm{Var}(P_P)}$$\nAssuming the population is in equilibrium, the phenotypic variance is stable across generations, so $\\mathrm{Var}(P_P) = V_P$.\n\nThe covariance term, $\\mathrm{Cov}(P_P, P_O)$, must be expanded based on the provided model:\n$$P_P = A_P + D_P + I_P + E_P$$\n$$P_O = A_O + D_O + I_O + E_O$$\nThus, the covariance is:\n$$\\mathrm{Cov}(P_P, P_O) = \\mathrm{Cov}(A_P + D_P + I_P + E_P, A_O + D_O + I_O + E_O)$$\nUnder the standard assumptions of the quantitative genetic model (uncorrelated components, unless specified otherwise), this expansion simplifies. We assume $\\mathrm{Cov}(G, E) = 0$ at the individual level, but the problem explicitly introduces a covariance between the environmental deviations of relatives, $C_{EP,EO}$. The cross-covariance terms between different genetic and environmental components (e.g., $\\mathrm{Cov}(A_P, E_O)$, $\\mathrm{Cov}(D_P, I_O)$) are assumed to be zero. The total covariance is the sum of the covariances of like components:\n$$\\mathrm{Cov}(P_P, P_O) = \\mathrm{Cov}(A_P, A_O) + \\mathrm{Cov}(D_P, D_O) + \\mathrm{Cov}(I_P, I_O) + \\mathrm{Cov}(E_P, E_O)$$\nLet us analyze each term:\n1.  $\\mathrm{Cov}(A_P, A_O)$: An offspring shares exactly one-half of its genes with a given parent. The covariance of their additive genetic values is therefore $\\frac{1}{2} V_A$. This is a fundamental result.\n2.  $\\mathrm{Cov}(D_P, D_O)$: Dominance variance arises from interactions between alleles at a single locus. Since a parent and offspring share only one allele at each locus (identical by descent), not a full genotype, the probability of them sharing the specific pair of alleles that creates a dominance effect is zero under random mating. Thus, $\\mathrm{Cov}(D_P, D_O) = 0$.\n3.  $\\mathrm{Cov}(I_P, I_O)$: Epistatic covariance depends on the type of epistasis. For additive-by-additive epistasis, the covariance is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 V_{AA} = \\frac{1}{4} V_{AA}$. For higher-order terms, the coefficient is smaller. In many analyses, these terms are considered negligible and are ignored for a first-order approximation.\n4.  $\\mathrm{Cov}(E_P, E_O)$: This is the covariance of environmental effects shared between parent and offspring, explicitly defined in the problem as $C_{EP,EO}$.\n\nIgnoring epistatic covariance for simplicity, the total phenotypic covariance is:\n$$\\mathrm{Cov}(P_P, P_O) \\approx \\frac{1}{2} V_A + C_{EP,EO}$$\nSubstituting this into the slope formula, we get the expected slope of the regression:\n$$b_{O,P} \\approx \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} V_A + C_{EP,EO}}{V_P} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{V_A}{V_P} + \\frac{C_{EP,EO}}{V_P} = \\frac{1}{2} h^2 + \\frac{C_{EP,EO}}{V_P}$$\nIn the absence of shared environmental effects ($C_{EP,EO} = 0$), the slope is $b_{O,P} = \\frac{1}{2} h^2$. Thus, heritability is typically estimated as $\\hat{h}^2 = 2 b_{O,P}$.\nWith the shared environment, the estimate becomes:\n$$\\hat{h}^2 = 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} h^2 + \\frac{C_{EP,EO}}{V_P} \\right) = h^2 + \\frac{2 C_{EP,EO}}{V_P}$$\nThe bias in the estimate of $h^2$ is $\\frac{2 C_{EP,EO}}{V_P}$. The bias in the slope itself is $\\frac{C_{EP,EO}}{V_P}$.\nIf $C_{EP,EO} > 0$, as is common when parental care or a shared territory provides a better-than-average environment, the slope is inflated, leading to an overestimation of $h^2$. If $C_{EP,EO} < 0$, which could occur if parents and offspring compete for resources, the slope is deflated, leading to an underestimation of $h^2$.\n\n### Evaluation of a Bias-Eliminating Experimental Design\nTo obtain an unbiased estimate of $h^2$, the term $C_{EP,EO}$ must be made zero. This requires experimentally decoupling the genetic relationship from the environmental relationship. Cross-fostering is the standard method. In a cross-fostering experiment, offspring are transferred from their genetic parents to be raised by unrelated foster parents.\nThe regression is then performed on the phenotype of the offspring ($P_O$) versus the phenotype of their *genetic* parent ($P_{GP}$). The environment experienced by the offspring is that provided by the foster parent ($P_{FP}$). If foster parents are assigned randomly from the population, then the environment of the genetic parent is uncorrelated with the environment of the foster parent. Consequently, the environmental covariance between the genetic parent and the offspring is zero in expectation:\n$$\\mathrm{Cov}(E_{GP}, E_O) = 0$$\nUnder this design, the expected regression slope of offspring on genetic parent becomes:\n$$b_{O,GP} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(P_{GP}, P_O)}{V_P} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} V_A}{V_P} = \\frac{1}{2} h^2$$\nThis provides an unbiased estimate. A robust design involves:\n- **Randomization**: Offspring must be randomly assigned to foster nests to break any potential pre-existing correlations.\n- **Reciprocity and Splitting**: Exchanging offspring between pairs of nests is good; a design where split-litters or split-clutches (half the brood is fostered, half stays) are reciprocally exchanged among multiple nests is superior.\n- **Blocking**: To control for confounding environmental gradients, transfers should be performed within spatiotemporal blocks (e.g., nests in the same area that hatch on the same day).\n- **Control for brood size**: Brood sizes should be equalized post-transfer to eliminate this as a confounding variable.\n- **Prenatal effects**: For oviparous species (e.g., birds), transferring eggs pre-incubation removes post-hatching parental effects and incubation effects, but not maternal effects related to egg composition. For viviparous species (mammals), only embryo transfer can remove prenatal maternal effects, but this is rarely feasible in wild populations.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In the single-parent regression, the expected slope equals $\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2} V_A + C_{EP,EO}\\right) / V_P$, so $C_{EP,EO} > 0$ inflates and $C_{EP,EO} < 0$ deflates the estimate relative to the additive genetic expectation. A bias-eliminating design is complete reciprocal cross-fostering: at birth (or hatching), randomly exchange entire split-litters or split-clutches among unrelated nests within spatiotemporal blocks, equalize brood sizes, and assign each genetic familyâ€™s offspring to multiple foster parents; for oviparous species, perform split-clutch cross-fostering pre-incubation, or for viviparous species, use embryo transfer where feasible, to sever prenatal maternal environmental covariance. Randomization ensures $C_{EP,EO} = 0$ in expectation for genetic parentâ€“offspring pairs, yielding an unbiased regression; mid-parent regression under this design targets $h^2$.**\n- **Verdict: Correct.** The expression for the slope, $\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} V_A + C_{EP,EO}}{V_P}$, is precisely what was derived. The interpretation of the effect of the sign of $C_{EP,EO}$ is also correct. The proposed experimental design is a textbook example of a rigorous, state-of-the-art cross-fostering study, properly including randomization, blocking, split-clutches, brood size equalization, and consideration of prenatal effects. The conclusion that randomization ensures $\\mathrm{Cov}(E_{GP}, E_O) \\approx 0$ is the central principle. The final statement that a mid-parent regression under this design would estimate $h^2$ directly is also correct, as it removes the environmental covariance that would otherwise bias the mid-parent estimate as well.\n\n**B. Parental and offspring shared environments necessarily reduce the regression slope because of regression to the mean, so $C_{EP,EO} > 0$ deflates the estimate. Cross-fostering within families (swapping siblings between full-sib litters only) suffices, since siblings have similar genotypes and thus environmental similarity will average out without breaking the geneticâ€“environment correlation.**\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.** The premise is flawed. A positive shared environmental covariance ($C_{EP,EO} > 0$) makes relatives more similar than their genes alone would predict, thereby *inflating* the regression slope, not deflating it. The invocation of \"regression to the mean\" is a non-sequitur; this statistical phenomenon does not determine the direction of bias from shared environments. The proposed design of fostering within families is nonsensical and would fail to separate genetic from environmental covariances.\n\n**C. The bias in the single-parent regression is $C_{EP,EO} / V_A$, so it does not depend on $V_P$. Eliminating the bias does not require cross-fostering; instead, include measured environmental covariates as fixed effects in a regression of offspring on parent. This guarantees that $C_{EP,EO} = 0$ even for unmeasured environmental components.**\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.** The algebraic form of the bias in the slope is incorrect. As derived, the bias is $C_{EP,EO} / V_P$, not $C_{EP,EO} / V_A$. The statement that including measured covariates in a statistical model \"guarantees\" the elimination of bias from *unmeasured* components is false. This statistical approach can only account for the variance explained by the covariates that are actually measured. Any unmeasured and shared environmental factors will continue to contribute to $C_{EP,EO}$ and bias the estimate.\n\n**D. Using the mid-parent as the predictor removes environmental bias because averaging two parents cancels environmental effects. Therefore, the mid-parent slope equals $h^2$ regardless of $C_{EP,EO}$, and no cross-fostering is necessary as long as mating is random.**\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.** This is a common misconception. Averaging the phenotypes of two parents does not cancel the shared environmental effects they create for their offspring. The covariance with the offspring's environment is also averaged. The slope of offspring on mid-parent phenotype is approximately $h^2 + 2 C_{common\\_env} / V_P$, where $C_{common\\_env}$ is the covariance between the family environment and offspring phenotype. The environmental bias persists. Cross-fostering is still required to remove it.\n\n**E. The parentâ€“offspring slope is biased only by dominance variance $V_D$ and not by shared environments, because environmental deviations are independent by definition. To remove dominance bias, cross-foster offspring among full-sib nests only, which preserves environmental similarity while holding $V_D$ constant across nests.**\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.** This statement contains multiple fundamental errors. First, the covariance between parent and offspring due to dominance, $\\mathrm{Cov}(D_P, D_O)$, is zero. Dominance variance does not bias the parent-offspring regression slope. Second, the claim that environmental deviations are independent \"by definition\" is contradicted by the problem's own premise ($C_{EP,EO}$) and the reality of family-structured populations. Shared environments are a primary source of bias. The entire premise and the proposed experiment are based on incorrect genetic principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2838178"}]}
