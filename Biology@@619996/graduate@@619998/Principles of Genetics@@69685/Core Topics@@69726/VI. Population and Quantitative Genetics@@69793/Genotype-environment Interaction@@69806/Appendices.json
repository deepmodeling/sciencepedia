An un-normalized eigenvector is $(1, 0, -1)^{\\top}$. Normalizing this vector gives:\n$$u_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/\\sqrt{2} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe sign convention is fixed by the relation $u_1 = (1/d_1)R v_1$, which confirms this choice of sign.\n\nThe third step is to compute the AMMI1 genotype scores, defined as the first column of $U D$. This vector is $d_1 u_1$:\n$$d_1 u_1 = \\sqrt{1.08} \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/\\sqrt{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{1.08/2} \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\sqrt{1.08/2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{0.54} \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\sqrt{0.54} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe AMMI1 genotype score for genotype $G_1$ is the first element of this vector.\n$$\\text{Score}(G_1) = \\sqrt{0.54} \\approx 0.7348469$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.7348$.\n\nFinally, we interpret the sign structure of the first interaction principal component (IPC1). The interaction is approximated by $R_{ge} \\approx d_1 u_{g1} v_{e1}$. The term $d_1 u_{g1}$ is the genotype score for the $g$-th genotype on IPC1, and $v_{e1}$ is the environment score for the $e$-th environment on IPC1.\nThe genotype scores are $(\\sqrt{0.54}, 0, -\\sqrt{0.54})^{\\top}$. Genotype $G_1$ has a positive score, $G_3$ has a negative score, and $G_2$ has a zero score.\nThe first right singular vector $v_1$ is proportional to $(0.6, -0.3, -0.3)^{\\top}$, so environment $E_1$ has a positive score, while $E_2$ and $E_3$ have negative scores.\nThe interaction effect for a pair $(G_g, E_e)$ is proportional to the product of their scores.\n- For $G_1$: The product is positive for $E_1$ (positive $\\times$ positive) and negative for $E_2$ and $E_3$ (positive $\\times$ negative). This means $G_1$ performs better than its additive model prediction in $E_1$ but worse in $E_2$ and $E_3$.\n- For $G_3$: The product is negative for $E_1$ (negative $\\times$ positive) and positive for $E_2$ and $E_3$ (negative $\\times$ negative). This means $G_3$ shows the opposite pattern of response to $G_1$.\n- For $G_2$: The score is zero, indicating it is a stable genotype whose performance across environments is well-described by the additive model alone, exhibiting no significant interaction along this primary axis.\nThe sign structure thus separates genotypes with contrasting specific adaptations to environments.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7348}$$", "id": "2820171"}]}
