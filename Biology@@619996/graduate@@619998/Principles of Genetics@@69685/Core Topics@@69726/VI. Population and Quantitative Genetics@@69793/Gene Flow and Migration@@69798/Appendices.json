The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and complete, allowing for a direct solution.\n\nThe standardized measure of genetic differentiation, $F_{ST}$, for a diploid island model with two demes of equal effective size $N$ and a symmetric migration rate $m$ at equilibrium is given by the approximation:\n$$ F_{ST} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 4Nm} $$\nThis equation quantifies the balance between genetic drift, which increases differentiation, and gene flow (migration), which homogenizes gene pools.
