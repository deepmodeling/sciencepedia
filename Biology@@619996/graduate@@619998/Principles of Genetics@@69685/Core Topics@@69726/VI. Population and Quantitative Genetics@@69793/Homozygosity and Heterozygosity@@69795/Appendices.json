It is a standard problem in population genetics. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the inbreeding coefficient, $F_{IS}$, from a sample of genotype counts. The solution must be derived from first principles as stipulated. Let the alleles at the biallelic locus be $A$ and $B$. The observed counts for genotypes $AA$, $AB$, and $BB$ are given as $n_{AA} = 112$, $n_{AB} = 58$, and $n_{BB} = 30$. The total sample size is $n = n_{AA} + n_{AB} + n_{BB} = 112 + 58 + 30 = 200$.\n\nFirst, we derive the maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) for the frequency of allele $A$, denoted by $p$. The frequency of allele $B$ is then $q = 1-p$. According to the principles of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), the expected frequencies of the genotypes $AA$, $AB$, and $BB$ in the population are $p^2$, $2pq$, and $q^2 = (1-p)^2$, respectively.\n\nAssuming the sample is drawn from a large, randomly mating population, the genotype counts follow a multinomial distribution. The likelihood function $L$ for the parameter $p$, given the observed counts, is proportional to the product of the probabilities of observing each genotype, raised to the power of its count:\n$$ L(p | n_{AA}, n_{AB}, n_{BB}) \\propto (p^2)^{n_{AA}} (2p(1-p))^{n_{AB}} ((1-p)^2)^{n_{BB}} $$\nWe can simplify this expression by combining terms with $p$ and $(1-p)$:\n$$ L(p) \\propto p^{2n_{AA}} \\cdot p^{n_{AB}} \\cdot (1-p)^{n_{AB}} \\cdot (1-p)^{2n_{BB}} $$\n$$ L(p) \\propto p^{2n_{AA} + n_{AB}} (1-p)^{n_{AB} + 2n_{BB}} $$\nTo find the value of $p$ that maximizes this likelihood, we work with the log-likelihood function, $\\ln L(p)$, as it simplifies the maximization problem by converting products to sums:\n$$ \\ln L(p) = C + (2n_{AA} + n_{AB})\\ln(p) + (n_{AB} + 2n_{BB})\\ln(1-p) $$\nwhere $C$ is a constant that does not depend on $p$.

This is derived from the HWE principle:\n$$ H_e(p) = 2p(1-p) $$\nThe estimator for the expected heterozygosity, $\\hat{H}_e$, is obtained by substituting the MLE $\\hat{p}$ into this formula:\n$$ \\hat{H}_e = 2\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p}) $$\nUsing our calculated value of $\\hat{p} = 0.705$:\n$$ \\hat{H}_e = 2(0.705)(1 - 0.705) = 2(0.705)(0.295) = 0.41595 $$\n\nFinally, Wright's inbreeding coefficient, $F_{IS}$, is defined as the standardized deficit of heterozygotes in the subpopulation relative to the HWE expectation.

The first significant figure is $3$. The next three are $0$, $2$, and $8$. The fifth digit is $0$, so we do not round up.\n$$ \\hat{F}_{IS} \\approx 0.3028 $$\nThis value indicates a substantial deficit of heterozygotes in the sample compared to the expectation under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium based on the sample's allele frequencies.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.3028}\n$$", "id": "2823093"}, {"introduction": "When comparing genetic diversity between populations, a common challenge arises when sample sizes are unequal, as this can bias simple estimates of heterozygosity.

You are tasked with designing a Quality Control (QC) procedure that uses Mendelian trios to estimate a symmetric per-allele genotyping error rate and then uses that estimate to correct the observed heterozygosity for a cohort. Assume the following foundational facts and definitions as the base for your derivation: Mendelian segregation in trios, independence of genotype errors across alleles and individuals, negligible de novo mutation rate per site (on the order of $10^{-8}$), and that observed heterozygosity $H_O$ is the fraction of heterozygous genotype calls.\n\nTo ensure scientific realism, the QC procedure is constrained as follows. Across a large set of trio-by-locus observations, you restrict to loci where both parents have replicated, concordant, high-quality genotype calls and are opposite homozygotes (one parent $A/A$, the other $B/B$). Under Mendel’s laws, the true child genotype at such loci must be $A/B$.

The probability for this is $P(\\text{obs} = A|A) \\times P(\\text{obs} = A|B) = (1-\\varepsilon)\\varepsilon$.\nThe observed genotype is $B/B$ if the true $A$ allele is read as $B$ AND the true $B$ allele is read as $B$. The probability for this is $P(\\text{obs} = B|A) \\times P(\\text{obs} = B|B) = \\varepsilon(1-\\varepsilon)$.\n\nSince these are disjoint events, the total probability $p_{err}$ that a true heterozygote is observed as non-heterozygous is the sum:\n$$p_{err} = P(\\text{obs } A/A \\text{ or } B/B | \\text{true } A/B) = (1-\\varepsilon)\\varepsilon + \\varepsilon(1-\\varepsilon) = 2\\varepsilon(1-\\varepsilon)$$\nThe problem states that out of $N = 120,000$ such trio-by-locus observations (where the child is a true heterozygote), $K = 900$ are observed as non-heterozygous. The number of such errors $K$ follows a binomial distribution with $N$ trials and success probability $p_{err}$.\n$$K \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N, p_{err})$$\nThe likelihood function for $\\varepsilon$ is:\n$$L(\\varepsilon; K, N) = \\binom{N}{K} [p_{err}]^K [1-p_{err}]^{N-K} = \\binom{N}{K} [2\\varepsilon(1-\\varepsilon)]^K [1-2\\varepsilon(1-\\varepsilon)]^{N-K}$$\nThe maximum likelihood estimate for a binomial probability parameter is the sample proportion.

The observed heterozygosity, $h_{\\text{obs}}$, is the fraction of all genotypes that are observed as heterozygous.

It is observed as heterozygous ($A/B$) if one of its alleles is read correctly as $A$ and the other is misread as $B$. There are two ways this can happen based on which allele copy is misread: $(A \\to A, A \\to B)$ or $(A \\to B, A \\to A)$. The probability for each is $(1-\\varepsilon)\\varepsilon$. Thus, $P(\\text{obs Het} | \\text{true Hom}) = (1-\\varepsilon)\\varepsilon + \\varepsilon(1-\\varepsilon) = 2\\varepsilon(1-\\varepsilon)$.\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for $h_{\\text{obs}}$:\n$$h_{\\text{obs}} = \\left[1 - 2\\varepsilon(1-\\varepsilon)\\right]H + \\left[2\\varepsilon(1-\\varepsilon)\\right](1-H)$$\nWe now solve for $H$.\n$$h_{\\text{obs}} = H - 2\\varepsilon(1-\\varepsilon)H + 2\\varepsilon(1-\\varepsilon) - 2\\varepsilon(1-\\varepsilon)H$$\n$$h_{\\text{obs}} = H \\left[1 - 4\\varepsilon(1-\\varepsilon)\\right] + 2\\varepsilon(1-\\varepsilon)$$\n$$h_{\\text{obs}} - 2\\varepsilon(1-\\varepsilon) = H \\left[1 - 4\\varepsilon + 4\\varepsilon^2\\right]$$\n$$h_{\\text{obs}} - 2\\varepsilon(1-\\varepsilon) = H (1-2\\varepsilon)^2$$\n$$H = \\frac{h_{\\text{obs}} - 2\\varepsilon(1-\\varepsilon)}{(1-2\\varepsilon)^2}$$\nThis expression gives the true heterozygosity $H$ as a function of the observed heterozygosity $h_{\\text{obs}}$ and the error rate $\\varepsilon$.
