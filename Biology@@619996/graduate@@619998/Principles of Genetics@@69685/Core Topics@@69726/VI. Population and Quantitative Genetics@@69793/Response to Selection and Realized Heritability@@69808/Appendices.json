This first practice guides you through the logical steps to derive the breeder's equation, which is the cornerstone for predicting the response to selection in quantitative genetics. By formalizing the relationship between an individual's phenotypic value and its underlying breeding value, you will see precisely how the response to selection ($R$) is linked to the selection differential ($S$) and narrow-sense heritability ($h^2$). You will then apply this fundamental equation to calculate a realized heritability from experimental data and interpret its meaning in the context of the underlying genetic architecture of a trait [@problem_id:2831004].", "problem": "A large, randomly mating population is undergoing mass selection on a quantitative trait that is influenced by many loci with primarily additive gene action. Assume the standard additive decomposition $P = A + E$, where $P$ is phenotype, $A$ is additive genetic value (breeding value), and $E$ is environmental deviation, with $\\operatorname{Var}(P) = \\sigma_{P}^{2}$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(A) = \\sigma_{A}^{2}$. Narrow-sense heritability is defined as $h^{2} = \\sigma_{A}^{2} / \\sigma_{P}^{2}$. The selection differential $S$ is defined as the difference between the mean phenotype of the selected parents and the mean phenotype of the population prior to selection, and the response to selection $R$ is defined as the difference between the mean phenotype of the offspring generation and the mean phenotype of the population prior to selection. Assume no systematic environmental shift between generations, equal parental contributions, and that mating is at random so that the mean breeding value transmitted equals the mean breeding value of the selected parents.\n\nUsing only these foundational definitions and assumptions, first derive an expression linking the expected one-generation response $R$ to the selection differential $S$ and the narrow-sense heritability $h^{2}$. Then define the realized narrow-sense heritability $h^2_R$ in terms of observable quantities and compute its numerical value in the first generation of a mass selection experiment where the observed selection differential is $S = 1.5$ and the observed response is $R = 0.6$. Provide your numerical result for $h^2_R$ as an exact decimal; no rounding is necessary. Finally, based on the same foundational theory, briefly discuss whether the realized estimate $h^2_R$ is consistent with an independent pedigree-based estimate $h^{2} = 0.4$ obtained from a linear mixed model on the same population under similar environmental conditions. Your final numeric answer must be only the computed $h^2_R$.", "solution": "The problem statement is scrutinized and found to be valid. It is a well-posed problem in quantitative genetics, based on standard, scientifically grounded principles and definitions, with all necessary information provided. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for three components: first, a derivation of the relationship between response to selection ($R$), selection differential ($S$), and narrow-sense heritability ($h^{2}$); second, the calculation of realized heritability ($h^2_R$) from experimental data; and third, a discussion comparing this realized value to a pedigree-based estimate.\n\nLet us begin with the formal derivation. We are given the phenotypic model for a quantitative trait:\n$$P = A + E$$\nwhere $P$ is the phenotype, $A$ is the additive genetic value (or breeding value), and $E$ is the environmental deviation. The means of the population are denoted $\\mu_{P}$, $\\mu_{A}$, and $\\mu_{E}$. Without loss of generality, we can set the mean environmental deviation to zero, $\\mu_{E} = 0$, such that $\\mu_{P} = \\mu_{A}$. We are given the variances $\\operatorname{Var}(P) = \\sigma_{P}^{2}$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(A) = \\sigma_{A}^{2}$, and the definition of narrow-sense heritability as $h^{2} = \\sigma_{A}^{2} / \\sigma_{P}^{2}$. We assume that the breeding value and environmental deviation are uncorrelated, $\\operatorname{Cov}(A, E) = 0$.\n\nThe relationship between an individual's breeding value $A$ and its phenotype $P$ can be described by a linear regression of $A$ on $P$. The slope of this regression, $b_{A \\cdot P}$, is given by:\n$$b_{A \\cdot P} = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(A, P)}{\\operatorname{Var}(P)}$$\nWe can expand the covariance term:\n$$\\operatorname{Cov}(A, P) = \\operatorname{Cov}(A, A + E) = \\operatorname{Cov}(A, A) + \\operatorname{Cov}(A, E)$$\nGiven $\\operatorname{Cov}(A, A) = \\operatorname{Var}(A) = \\sigma_{A}^{2}$ and the assumption $\\operatorname{Cov}(A, E) = 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\\operatorname{Cov}(A, P) = \\sigma_{A}^{2}$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the regression slope gives:\n$$b_{A \\cdot P} = \\frac{\\sigma_{A}^{2}}{\\sigma_{P}^{2}} = h^{2}$$\nThis establishes that the regression of breeding value on phenotype is equal to the narrow-sense heritability. This regression predicts the expected deviation of an individual's breeding value from the population mean, given its phenotypic deviation:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[A - \\mu_{A} | P] = h^{2} (P - \\mu_{P})$$\nNow, consider the group of selected parents. Let their mean phenotype be $\\mu_{P_{s}}$ and their mean breeding value be $\\mu_{A_{s}}$. The selection differential $S$ is defined as the deviation of the selected parents' mean phenotype from the base population mean phenotype:\n$$S = \\mu_{P_{s}} - \\mu_{P}$$\nThe expected deviation of the mean breeding value of this selected group from the population mean breeding value is found by applying the regression to the mean phenotype of the selected group:\n$$\\mu_{A_{s}} - \\mu_{A} = h^{2} (\\mu_{P_{s}} - \\mu_{P}) = h^{2} S$$\nThis equation predicts the change in the mean breeding value of the parents chosen for reproduction. The problem states that \"mating is at random so that the mean breeding value transmitted equals the mean breeding value of the selected parents\". This implies that the mean breeding value of the offspring generation, $\\mu_{A'}$, is equal to the mean breeding value of the selected parents, $\\mu_{A_{s}}$. Therefore, the change in mean breeding value from the parent generation to the offspring generation is:\n$$\\Delta\\mu_{A} = \\mu_{A'} - \\mu_{A} = \\mu_{A_{s}} - \\mu_{A} = h^{2} S$$\nThe response to selection, $R$, is defined as the change in the mean phenotype of the population across one generation:\n$$R = \\mu_{P'} - \\mu_{P}$$\nwhere $\\mu_{P'}$ is the mean phenotype of the offspring generation. We can write $\\mu_{P'} = \\mu_{A'} + \\mu_{E'}$. The problem assumption of \"no systematic environmental shift between generations\" implies $\\mu_{E'} = \\mu_{E}$. Since we have set $\\mu_{E} = 0$, it follows that $\\mu_{E'} = 0$ as well. Thus, $\\mu_{P'} = \\mu_{A'}$. With $\\mu_{P} = \\mu_{A}$, the response $R$ becomes:\n$$R = \\mu_{A'} - \\mu_{A} = \\Delta\\mu_{A}$$\nBy combining our findings, we arrive at the foundational equation of quantitative genetics, often called the breeder's equation:\n$$R = h^{2} S$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNext, we define and compute the realized narrow-sense heritability, $h^2_R$. When $S$ and $R$ are observed quantities from a selection experiment, this equation can be rearranged to provide an estimate of heritability. This estimate is termed the realized heritability because it is calculated from the observed response to selection.\n$$h^2_R = \\frac{R}{S}$$\nThe problem provides the observed values from a mass selection experiment: the selection differential is $S = 1.5$ and the response to selection is $R = 0.6$. We compute $h^2_R$ as:\n$$h^2_R = \\frac{0.6}{1.5} = \\frac{6}{15} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4$$\n\nFinally, we are asked to discuss whether this realized estimate, $h^2_R = 0.4$, is consistent with an independent pedigree-based estimate of $h^{2} = 0.4$. The two estimates are numerically identical. This represents a strong consistency check on the underlying genetic model of the trait. Realized heritability, $h^2_R$, measures heritability as the ratio of response to selection, making it a direct consequence of an evolutionary process. A pedigree-based estimate from a linear mixed model, conversely, infers heritability from patterns of resemblance among relatives in the population, partitioning phenotypic variance into genetic and environmental components based on the known covariance structure defined by the pedigree. The perfect agreement between these two distinct methods suggests that the primary assumptions of the simple additive model hold true for this trait in this population. Specifically, it implies that non-additive genetic effects (dominance and epistasis), genotype-by-environment interactions, and systematic environmental trends between generations are negligible, as any of these factors would cause a discrepancy between the predicted response (based on the pedigree $h^2$) and the observed response (which defines $h^2_R$). The consistency confirms that the trait responds to selection precisely as predicted by the additive genetic variance present in the population.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4}$$", "id": "2831004"}, {"introduction": "While the breeder's equation, $R = h^2S$, appears simple, its predictive power hinges on the accurate quantification of its parameters.

The narrow-sense realized heritability is known to be $h^{2}=0.3$.\n\nUsing only core definitions and distributional properties, compute the selection differential $S$ from first principles for this truncation scheme and then determine the expected one-generation response to selection $R$ in phenotypic standard deviation units. Report only the numerical value of $R$, rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem posed is a standard exercise in quantitative genetics and is well-defined, scientifically sound, and internally consistent. It is therefore deemed valid and a formal solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to compute the expected one-generation response to selection, $R$, for a quantitative trait. The fundamental equation governing this process under the specified assumptions (additive genetic architecture, stable environment, no genotype-by-environment interaction) is the Breeder's Equation:\n$$R = h^{2}S$$\nwhere $h^{2}$ is the narrow-sense heritability and $S$ is the selection differential. We are given $h^{2} = 0.3$. The primary task is to compute $S$ from first principles.\n\nThe selection differential, $S$, is defined as the difference between the mean phenotypic value of the selected individuals, $\\mu_s$, and the mean phenotypic value of the entire population before selection, $\\mu_P$.\n$$S = \\mu_s - \\mu_P$$\nThe problem states that the trait has been standardized such that the population mean is $\\mu_P = 0$ and the phenotypic standard deviation is $\\sigma_P = 1$. Consequently, the phenotypic values, $P$, follow a standard normal distribution, which we denote as $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$. The probability density function (PDF) of $Z$ is $\\phi(z) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z^2}{2}\\right)$. With $\\mu_P = 0$, the selection differential simplifies to $S = \\mu_s$.\n\nThe selection procedure is truncation selection, where only the top $p = 5\\% = 0.05$ of the population is retained for breeding. Let $T$ represent the truncation threshold, which is the phenotypic value that separates the selected group from the rest of the population. This value $T$ is defined by the condition $P(Z > T) = p$, or equivalently, $\\int_{T}^{\\infty} \\phi(z) dz = p = 0.05$.\n\nThe mean phenotype of the selected group, $\\mu_s$, is the conditional expectation of the phenotype $Z$ given that $Z > T$. It is computed as:\n$$\\mu_s = E[Z | Z > T] = \\frac{\\int_{T}^{\\infty} z \\cdot \\phi(z) dz}{P(Z > T)}$$\nThe denominator is given as $p = 0.05$. We must evaluate the numerator from first principles as requested.\n$$ \\int_{T}^{\\infty} z \\cdot \\phi(z) dz = \\int_{T}^{\\infty} z \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z^2}{2}\\right) dz $$\nThis integral is evaluated using the substitution $u = -\\frac{z^2}{2}$. The differential is $du = -z \\cdot dz$. The limits of integration transform as follows: as $z \\to T$, $u \\to -\\frac{T^2}{2}$; as $z \\to \\infty$, $u \\to -\\infty$. The integral becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\int_{-T^2/2}^{-\\infty} \\exp(u) (-du) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{-T^2/2} \\exp(u) du $$\nThe antiderivative of $\\exp(u)$ is $\\exp(u)$. Evaluating the definite integral yields:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\left[ \\exp(u) \\right]_{-\\infty}^{-T^2/2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\left( \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T^2}{2}\\right) - \\lim_{u\\to-\\infty} \\exp(u) \\right) $$\nSince $\\lim_{u\\to-\\infty} \\exp(u) = 0$, the result is:\n$$ \\int_{T}^{\\infty} z \\cdot \\phi(z) dz = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T^2}{2}\\right) = \\phi(T) $$\nThus, the mean of the selected group is proven to be:\n$$ \\mu_s = \\frac{\\phi(T)}{p} $$\nAnd the selection differential is $S = \\frac{\\phi(T)}{p}$. Since $\\sigma_P = 1$, this quantity $S$ is also known as the selection intensity, $i$.\n\nWe now proceed with the numerical computation.\nFirst, we find the truncation point $T$ such that $P(Z > T) = 0.05$. This is equivalent to finding $T$ for which the cumulative distribution function (CDF) is $\\Phi(T) = P(Z \\le T) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$. Interpolating from a standard normal distribution table or using a computational tool, we find the value of the quantile:\n$$T \\approx 1.6448536$$\nNext, we calculate the value of the PDF at this point, $\\phi(T)$:\n$$ \\phi(T) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(1.6448536)^2}{2}\\right) \\approx \\frac{1}{2.506628} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2.70554}{2}\\right) \\approx 0.398942 \\exp(-1.35277) \\approx 0.1031356 $$\nNow, we can compute the selection differential $S$:\n$$ S = \\frac{\\phi(T)}{p} \\approx \\frac{0.1031356}{0.05} \\approx 2.062712 $$\nThis value is in units of phenotypic standard deviations. Since $\\sigma_P = 1$, $S$ is numerically $2.062712$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the response to selection, $R$, using the Breeder's Equation:\n$$ R = h^{2}S $$\nWith the given heritability $h^{2} = 0.3$, we have:\n$$ R = 0.3 \\times 2.062712 \\approx 0.6188136 $$\nThe problem requires the result to be reported to four significant figures.
