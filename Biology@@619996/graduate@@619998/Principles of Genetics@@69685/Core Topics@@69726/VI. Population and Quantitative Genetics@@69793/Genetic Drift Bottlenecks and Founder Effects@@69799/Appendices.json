The answer must be a single real number with no units.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in theoretical population genetics.\n\nWe are tasked with deriving the fixation probability of a neutral allele from first principles within the framework of the Wright–Fisher model. Let $N$ be the constant size of the diploid population. The total number of gene copies at any given locus is $2N$. Let $X_t$ denote the frequency of the neutral mutant allele in generation $t$. The initial state is a single copy of the mutant allele, which means the initial frequency is $X_0 = \\frac{1}{2N}$. The process has two absorbing states: loss, where the frequency is $X=0$, and fixation, where the frequency is $X=1$.\n\nThe core of the Wright–Fisher model lies in the sampling process between generations. The number of copies of the mutant allele in generation $t+1$, let us call this quantity $k_{t+1}$, is a random variable drawn from a binomial distribution. The number of trials is the total number of gene copies, $2N$, and the probability of success (i.e., of sampling a mutant allele) is the frequency of that allele in the parent generation, $X_t$. Thus, the distribution of $k_{t+1}$ given $X_t$ is:\n$$k_{t+1} \\sim \\text{Binomial}(2N, X_t)$$\nThe allele frequency in generation $t+1$ is $X_{t+1} = \\frac{k_{t+1}}{2N}$.\n\nOur derivation must proceed from this foundational fact. We shall analyze the expected value of the allele frequency over time. The expectation of a binomial random variable $\\text{Binomial}(n, p)$ is $np$. Therefore, the expected number of mutant alleles in generation $t+1$, conditional on the frequency in generation $t$, is:\n$$E[k_{t+1} | X_t] = 2N \\cdot X_t$$\n\nUsing this, we can find the expected allele frequency in generation $t+1$, conditional on the frequency in generation $t$:\n$$E[X_{t+1} | X_t] = E\\left[\\frac{k_{t+1}}{2N} \\Bigg| X_t\\right] = \\frac{1}{2N} E[k_{t+1} | X_t] = \\frac{1}{2N} (2N \\cdot X_t) = X_t$$\n\nThis result, $E[X_{t+1} | X_t] = X_t$, signifies that the sequence of allele frequencies, $\\{X_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$, is a martingale. This is a direct consequence of genetic drift being a neutral process; on average, the allele frequency does not change from one generation to the next. By the law of total expectation, the unconditional expectation of the allele frequency is constant across all generations:\n$$E[X_t] = E[E[X_t | X_{t-1}]] = E[X_{t-1}] = \\dots = E[X_0]$$\nSince the initial frequency $X_0$ is a given, non-random quantity, its expectation is simply its value, $E[X_0] = X_0$. Therefore, for any generation $t$, we have $E[X_t] = X_0$.\n\nThe process terminates when the allele frequency reaches one of the absorbing boundaries, either $0$ or $1$. For a finite population of size $N$, this will happen with probability $1$. Let $T$ be the stopping time, which is the generation at which one of these boundaries is first reached. The allele frequency at this time, $X_T$, is a random variable that can only take the value $0$ (loss) or $1$ (fixation).\n\nLet $\\pi_{fix}$ be the probability of eventual fixation, i.e., $P(X_T = 1) = \\pi_{fix}$. Then, the probability of loss is $P(X_T = 0) = 1 - \\pi_{fix}$. The expected value of the allele frequency at the stopping time $T$ is given by:\n$$E[X_T] = 1 \\cdot P(X_T = 1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_T = 0) = 1 \\cdot \\pi_{fix} + 0 \\cdot (1 - \\pi_{fix}) = \\pi_{fix}$$\n\nThe sequence $\\{X_t\\}$ is a bounded martingale (as $0 \\le X_t \\le 1$), and the stopping time $T$ is almost surely finite. Under these conditions, the Optional Stopping Theorem applies, stating that the expected value at the stopping time is equal to the initial expected value:\n$$E[X_T] = E[X_0]$$\nSubstituting our expressions for these expectations, we find:\n$$\\pi_{fix} = X_0$$\nThis is a general and fundamental result in population genetics: for a neutral allele, the probability of fixation is equal to its initial frequency in the population.\n\nThe problem specifies a population of size $N = 10^5$ and an initial state of a single mutant allele. The total number of gene copies in this diploid population is $2N$. The initial frequency $X_0$ is thus:\n$$X_0 = \\frac{1}{2N} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 10^5}$$\nTherefore, the fixation probability is:\n$$\\pi_{fix} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 10^5} = \\frac{1}{200000} = 0.000005$$\nThis value can be expressed in scientific notation as $5 \\times 10^{-6}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5 \\times 10^{-6}}$$", "id": "2816913"}, {"introduction": "While we can consider the fate of a single allele, genetic drift's broader impact is the systematic erosion of genetic diversity across the entire genome.
