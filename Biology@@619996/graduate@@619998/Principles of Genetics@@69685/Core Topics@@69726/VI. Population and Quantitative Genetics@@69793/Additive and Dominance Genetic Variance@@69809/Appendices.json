The total genetic variance ($V_G$) can be partitioned into a component representing the average, heritable effects of alleles (additive variance, $V_A$) and a component representing interactions between alleles at that locus (dominance variance, $V_D$). This first practice explores the foundational case of pure additivity, where the heterozygote's phenotype is perfectly intermediate, demonstrating how this specific relationship results in a dominance variance of zero [@problem_id:2806408].", "problem": "In a randomly mating, infinitely large population at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), consider a single diallelic locus with alleles $A$ and $a$ at frequencies $p$ and $q=1-p$, respectively. The genotypic values for the trait are $G_{AA}=10$, $G_{Aa}=7$, and $G_{aa}=4$. Assume no epistasis and ignore environmental variance so that the total observed variance in the trait arises solely from this locus.\n\nUsing fundamental definitions from Fisher’s partition of genetic variance, treat the genotypic value as a function of the number of $A$ alleles $x \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$ and define the additive effect as the regression of the genotypic value on $x$. Based on this, define the additive genetic variance $V_{A}$ as the variance attributable to the regression (breeding) values and the dominance genetic variance $V_{D}$ as the remaining genetic variance after subtracting $V_{A}$ from the total genetic variance at the locus.\n\nGiven $p=0.3$ (so $q=0.7$), compute numerically the additive genetic variance $V_{A}$ and the dominance genetic variance $V_{D}$. Then, interpret the relative contributions by stating which component dominates and why, in terms of the position of the heterozygote relative to the homozygotes. Report your final numeric values for $V_{A}$ and $V_{D}$ as two numbers in the order $V_{A}, V_{D}$. Provide exact values; do not round.", "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It represents a standard exercise in quantitative genetics based on Fisher's model of variance partitioning. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of additive genetic variance, $V_{A}$, and dominance genetic variance, $V_{D}$, for a single diallelic locus in a population at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The total genetic variance, $V_{G}$, is the sum of these two components: $V_{G} = V_{A} + V_{D}$.\n\nThe givens are:\nAllele frequencies: $p = P(A) = 0.3$ and $q = P(a) = 1 - p = 0.7$.\nGenotypic values: $G_{AA} = 10$, $G_{Aa} = 7$, and $G_{aa} = 4$.\n\nUnder HWE, the frequencies of the genotypes are:\n$f(AA) = p^2 = (0.3)^2 = 0.09$\n$f(Aa) = 2pq = 2(0.3)(0.7) = 0.42$\n$f(aa) = q^2 = (0.7)^2 = 0.49$\n\nThe problem defines the additive effect based on the regression of genotypic value on the number of $A$ alleles, which we denote by $x \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. The genotypes $aa$, $Aa$, and $AA$ correspond to $x=0$, $x=1$, and $x=2$, respectively. Let $Y$ be the random variable for the genotypic value.\n\nFirst, we calculate the mean genotypic value of the population, $\\mu = E[Y]$:\n$$ \\mu = G_{aa} f(aa) + G_{Aa} f(Aa) + G_{AA} f(AA) $$\n$$ \\mu = (4)(0.49) + (7)(0.42) + (10)(0.09) = 1.96 + 2.94 + 0.90 = 5.8 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the total genetic variance, $V_{G} = \\text{Var}(Y) = E[Y^2] - (E[Y])^2$:\n$$ E[Y^2] = G_{aa}^2 f(aa) + G_{Aa}^2 f(Aa) + G_{AA}^2 f(AA) $$\n$$ E[Y^2] = (4^2)(0.49) + (7^2)(0.42) + (10^2)(0.09) = (16)(0.49) + (49)(0.42) + (100)(0.09) $$\n$$ E[Y^2] = 7.84 + 20.58 + 9.00 = 37.42 $$\n$$ V_{G} = 37.42 - (5.8)^2 = 37.42 - 33.64 = 3.78 $$\n\nThe additive genetic variance, $V_{A}$, is defined as the variance attributable to the linear regression of genotypic value ($Y$) on the number of $A$ alleles ($X$). $V_{A}$ is the variance of the breeding values. The regression coefficient, $\\beta$, is equivalent to the average effect of allele substitution, $\\alpha$.\n$$ \\beta = \\alpha = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\\text{Var}(X)} $$\n\nWe need the mean and variance of $X$. For a binomial distribution of alleles at a locus, $E[X] = 2p$ and $\\text{Var}(X) = 2pq$.\n$$ E[X] = 2(0.3) = 0.6 $$\n$$ \\text{Var}(X) = 2(0.3)(0.7) = 0.42 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the covariance, $\\text{Cov}(X, Y) = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y]$.\n$$ E[XY] = \\sum_{i} x_i y_i f_i = (0)(G_{aa})(q^2) + (1)(G_{Aa})(2pq) + (2)(G_{AA})(p^2) $$\n$$ E[XY] = (1)(7)(0.42) + (2)(10)(0.09) = 2.94 + 1.80 = 4.74 $$\n$$ \\text{Cov}(X, Y) = 4.74 - (0.6)(5.8) = 4.74 - 3.48 = 1.26 $$\n\nNow we can compute the regression coefficient $\\beta = \\alpha$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{1.26}{0.42} = 3 $$\n\nThe additive genetic variance $V_{A}$ is the part of the total variance explained by the linear regression. It is calculated as:\n$$ V_{A} = \\alpha^2 \\text{Var}(X) $$\n$$ V_{A} = (3)^2 (0.42) = 9 \\times 0.42 = 3.78 $$\n\nThe dominance genetic variance $V_{D}$ is the remaining genetic variance, i.e., the variance of the dominance deviations from the regression line.\n$$ V_{D} = V_{G} - V_{A} $$\n$$ V_{D} = 3.78 - 3.78 = 0 $$\n\nAlternatively, we can use the classic formulation involving additive ($a$) and dominance ($d$) effects, where the origin is the midpoint between the two homozygotes: $M = \\frac{G_{AA} + G_{aa}}{2} = \\frac{10+4}{2} = 7$.\nThe additive effect is $a = G_{AA} - M = 10 - 7 = 3$.\nThe dominance effect is $d = G_{Aa} - M = 7 - 7 = 0$.\nThe average effect of substitution is $\\alpha = a + (q-p)d = 3 + (0.7-0.3)(0) = 3$. This matches the regression result.\nThe variance components are then given by the standard formulae:\n$$ V_{A} = 2pq\\alpha^2 = 2(0.3)(0.7)(3^2) = 0.42 \\times 9 = 3.78 $$\n$$ V_{D} = (2pqd)^2 = (2(0.3)(0.7)(0))^2 = 0 $$\nBoth methods yield the identical result.\n\nInterpretation: The additive genetic variance is $V_{A} = 3.78$ and the dominance genetic variance is $V_{D} = 0$. The additive variance accounts for $100\\%$ of the total genetic variance. This signifies that the additive component completely dominates, or rather, it is the sole component. The reason for this is evident from the genotypic values. The value of the heterozygote, $G_{Aa} = 7$, is exactly at the midpoint of the values of the two homozygotes, $G_{AA} = 10$ and $G_{aa} = 4$. This relationship, where $G_{Aa} = \\frac{G_{AA} + G_{aa}}{2}$, is the definition of additive gene action, or \"no dominance\". When genotypic value is plotted against the number of $A$ alleles ($x=0, 1, 2$), the points $(0, 4)$, $(1, 7)$, and $(2, 10)$ lie perfectly on a straight line ($Y = 3X+4$).\nSince the relationship is perfectly linear, the linear regression model accounts for all the variance in the genotypic values. There are no deviations from this regression line, and therefore the dominance deviations are all zero. The variance of these zero-valued deviations, which is the dominance variance $V_{D}$, is consequently zero.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3.78 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2806408"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the ideal case of additivity, we now examine the more common scenario where dominance is present.
