It is also straightforward to show that $\\hat{D}$ is unbiased, as $E[\\hat{p}_1\\hat{p}_2]=E[\\hat{p}_1]E[\\hat{p}_2] = p_1p_2$ due to independence.\n\nThe read-depth-adjusted estimator for Hudson's $F_{ST}$ is the ratio of the unbiased numerator estimator to the consistent denominator estimator:\n$$ \\hat{F}_{ST} = \\frac{\\hat{N}}{\\hat{D}} = \\frac{(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2)^2 - \\left( \\frac{\\hat{p}_1(1-\\hat{p}_1)}{n_1-1} + \\frac{\\hat{p}_2(1-\\hat{p}_2)}{n_2-1} \\right)}{\\hat{p}_1(1-\\hat{p}_2) + \\hat{p}_2(1-\\hat{p}_1)} $$\n\nWe now apply this formula to the provided data.\nFor population $1$: $n_{1A} = 80$, $n_{1a} = 20$. Total depth $n_1 = 80 + 20 = 100$.\n$$ \\hat{p}_1 = \\frac{80}{100} = 0.8 $$\nFor population $2$: $n_{2A} = 30$, $n_{2a} = 70$. Total depth $n_2 = 30 + 70 = 100$.\n$$ \\hat{p}_2 = \\frac{30}{100} = 0.3 $$\nFirst, we compute the estimated numerator, $\\hat{N}$:\n$$ \\hat{N} = (0.8 - 0.3)^2 - \\left( \\frac{0.8(1-0.8)}{100-1} + \\frac{0.3(1-0.3)}{100-1} \\right) $$\n$$ \\hat{N} = (0.5)^2 - \\left( \\frac{0.8 \\times 0.2}{99} + \\frac{0.3 \\times 0.7}{99} \\right) $$\n$$ \\hat{N} = 0.25 - \\left( \\frac{0.16}{99} + \\frac{0.21}{99} \\right) $$\n$$ \\hat{N} = 0.25 - \\frac{0.37}{99} = \\frac{0.25 \\times 99 - 0.37}{99} = \\frac{24.75 - 0.37}{99} = \\frac{24.38}{99} $$\nNext, we compute the estimated denominator, $\\hat{D}$:\n$$ \\hat{D} = 0.8(1-0.3) + 0.3(1-0.8) $$\n$$ \\hat{D} = 0.8(0.7) + 0.3(0.2) = 0.56 + 0.06 = 0.62 $$\nFinally, we compute the $\\hat{F}_{ST}$ value:\n$$ \\hat{F}_{ST} = \\frac{\\hat{N}}{\\hat{D}} = \\frac{24.38/99}{0.62} = \\frac{24.38}{99 \\times 0.62} = \\frac{24.38}{61.38} \\approx 0.39720104... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.3972$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3972}$$", "id": "2745281"}]}
