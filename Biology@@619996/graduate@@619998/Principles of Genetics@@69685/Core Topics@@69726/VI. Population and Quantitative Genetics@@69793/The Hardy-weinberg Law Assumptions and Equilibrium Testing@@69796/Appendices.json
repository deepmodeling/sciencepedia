The assumptions, while idealizations, are precisely the conditions under which the Hardy-Weinberg principle is defined, forming the basis for the null hypothesis to be tested. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nWe proceed with the solution in three parts as requested.\n\nFirst, we derive the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) for the allele frequencies, denoted $p_A$, $p_B$, and $p_C$.

The likelihood function $L$ is proportional to the product of these probabilities raised to the power of their corresponding observed counts:\n$$L(p_A, p_B, p_C | \\text{data}) \\propto (p_A^2)^{n_{AA}} (2p_A p_B)^{n_{AB}} (2p_A p_C)^{n_{AC}} (p_B^2)^{n_{BB}} (2p_B p_C)^{n_{BC}} (p_C^2)^{n_{CC}}$$\nTo facilitate maximization, we use the log-likelihood function, $\\ln L$, ignoring constant terms:\n$$\\ln L = n_{AA}\\ln(p_A^2) + n_{AB}\\ln(2p_A p_B) + n_{AC}\\ln(2p_A p_C) + n_{BB}\\ln(p_B^2) + n_{BC}\\ln(2p_B p_C) + n_{CC}\\ln(p_C^2)$$\n$$\\ln L = 2n_{AA}\\ln(p_A) + n_{AB}(\\ln(p_A) + \\ln(p_B)) + n_{AC}(\\ln(p_A) + \\ln(p_C)) + 2n_{BB}\\ln(p_B) + n_{BC}(\\ln(p_B) + \\ln(p_C)) + 2n_{CC}\\ln(p_C) + \\text{constant}$$\nGrouping terms by allele frequency:\n$$\\ln L = (2n_{AA} + n_{AB} + n_{AC})\\ln(p_A) + (n_{AB} + 2n_{BB} + n_{BC})\\ln(p_B) + (n_{AC} + n_{BC} + 2n_{CC})\\ln(p_C) + \\text{constant}$$\nThe coefficients are the total counts of each allele in the sample.

This is a standard optimization problem whose solution yields the MLEs as the relative frequencies of each allele in the sample.

Round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem presents a valid and well-posed question in population genetics, specifically concerning the exact test for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). We shall proceed by following the three specified steps.\n\nFirst, we enumerate all possible genotype count configurations $(n_{AA}, n_{Aa}, n_{aa})$ consistent with the given total number of individuals, $N=10$, and the total count of allele $A$, $M=10$. These counts must satisfy two linear Diophantine equations:\n$$n_{AA} + n_{Aa} + n_{aa} = N = 10$$\n$$2n_{AA} + n_{Aa} = M = 10$$\nThe variables $n_{AA}, n_{Aa}, n_{aa}$ must be non-negative integers. From the second equation, we can express the number of heterozygotes, $n_{Aa}$, as a function of the number of homozygotes for the $A$ allele, $n_{AA}$:\n$$n_{Aa} = 10 - 2n_{AA}$$\nSince $n_{Aa}$ must be non-negative, $10 - 2n_{AA} \\geq 0$, which implies $2n_{AA} \\leq 10$, or $n_{AA} \\leq 5$. Thus, $n_{AA}$ can take integer values from $0$ to $5$. For each value of $n_{AA}$, we can determine the unique corresponding values for $n_{Aa}$ and then for $n_{aa}$ using the first equation, $n_{aa} = 10 - n_{AA} - n_{Aa}$. This yields the complete set of $6$ possible genotype count configurations:\n1. If $n_{AA}=0$, then $n_{Aa}=10 - 2(0) = 10$, and $n_{aa}=10 - 0 - 10 = 0$. Configuration: $(0, 10, 0)$.\n2. If $n_{AA}=1$, then $n_{Aa}=10 - 2(1) = 8$, and $n_{aa}=10 - 1 - 8 = 1$. Configuration: $(1, 8, 1)$.\n3. If $n_{AA}=2$, then $n_{Aa}=10 - 2(2) = 6$, and $n_{aa}=10 - 2 - 6 = 2$. Configuration: $(2, 6, 2)$.\n4. If $n_{AA}=3$, then $n_{Aa}=10 - 2(3) = 4$, and $n_{aa}=10 - 3 - 4 = 3$. Configuration: $(3, 4, 3)$.\n5.

Configuration: $(5, 0, 5)$.\n\nSecond, we derive the conditional sampling probability for any given configuration $(n_{AA}, n_{Aa}, n_{aa})$ under HWE, conditional on the observed total allele count $M$. The probability of observing a specific set of genotype counts in a sample of size $N$, given an allele frequency $p$ for allele $A$, follows a multinomial distribution:\n$$P(n_{AA}, n_{Aa}, n_{aa} | N, p) = \\frac{N!}{n_{AA}! n_{Aa}! n_{aa}!} (p^2)^{n_{AA}} (2p(1-p))^{n_{Aa}} ((1-p)^2)^{n_{aa}}$$\nThis can be rewritten by grouping terms with $p$ and $(1-p)$:\n$$P(n_{AA}, n_{Aa}, n_{aa} | N, p) = \\frac{N! 2^{n_{Aa}}}{n_{AA}! n_{Aa}! n_{aa}!} p^{2n_{AA} + n_{Aa}} (1-p)^{n_{Aa} + 2n_{aa}}$$\nThe exponents correspond to the total counts of alleles $A$ and $a$. Let $M = 2n_{AA} + n_{Aa}$ be the count of allele $A$, and $2N-M = n_{Aa} + 2n_{aa}$ be the count of allele $a$. The probability of observing $M$ copies of allele $A$ in a sample of $2N$ gene copies is given by the binomial distribution:\n$$P(M | N, p) = \\binom{2N}{M} p^M (1-p)^{2N-M}$$\nThe conditional probability of the genotype counts, given $N$ and $M$, is the ratio $P(\\text{counts} | N, p) / P(M | N, p)$. The terms involving the unknown frequency $p$ cancel out, yielding the exact probability:\n$$P(n_{AA}, n_{Aa}, n_{aa} | N, M) = \\frac{\\frac{N! 2^{n_{Aa}}}{n_{AA}! n_{Aa}! n_{aa}!} p^M (1-p)^{2N-M}}{\\binom{2N}{M} p^M (1-p)^{2N-M}} = \\frac{N! 2^{n_{Aa}}}{n_{AA}! n_{Aa}! n_{aa}!} \\frac{1}{\\binom{2N}{M}}$$\nFor this problem, $N=10$, $M=10$, so $2N=20$. The combinatorial constant in the denominator is $\\binom{20}{10} = \\frac{20!}{10!10!} = 184756$.\nWe calculate the probability for each of the $6$ configurations:\n1.  $P_1 = P(0, 10, 0) = \\frac{10! \\cdot 2^{10}}{0! \\cdot 10! \\cdot 0!} \\cdot \\frac{1}{184756} = \\frac{1024}{184756}$.\n2.  $P_2 = P(1, 8, 1) = \\frac{10! \\cdot 2^8}{1! \\cdot 8! \\cdot 1!} \\cdot \\frac{1}{184756} = \\frac{90 \\cdot 256}{184756} = \\frac{23040}{184756}$.\n3.  $P_3 = P(2, 6, 2) = \\frac{10! \\cdot 2^6}{2! \\cdot 6! \\cdot 2!} \\cdot \\frac{1}{184756} = \\frac{1260 \\cdot 64}{184756} = \\frac{80640}{184756}$.\n4.  $P_4 = P(3, 4, 3) = \\frac{10! \\cdot 2^4}{3! \\cdot 4! \\cdot 3!} \\cdot \\frac{1}{184756} = \\frac{4200 \\cdot 16}{184756} = \\frac{67200}{184756}$.\n5.  $P_5 = P(4, 2, 4) = \\frac{10! \\cdot 2^2}{4! \\cdot 2! \\cdot 4!} \\cdot \\frac{1}{184756} = \\frac{3150 \\cdot 4}{184756} = \\frac{12600}{184756}$.\n6.  $P_6 = P(5, 0, 5) = \\frac{10! \\cdot 2^0}{5! \\cdot 0! \\cdot 5!} \\cdot \\frac{1}{184756} = \\frac{252 \\cdot 1}{184756} = \\frac{252}{184756}$.\n\nThird, we compute the exact-test $p$-value. The observed sample is $(n_{AA}, n_{Aa}, n_{aa}) = (4, 2, 4)$, which has probability $P_{obs} = P_5 = \\frac{12600}{184756}$. The $p$-value is the sum of probabilities of all configurations whose probability is less than or equal to $P_{obs}$. We compare the numerators of the probabilities to the numerator of $P_5$, which is $12600$:\n- $P_1$: $1024 \\leq 12600$\n- $P_2$: $23040  12600$\n- $P_3$: $80640  12600$\n- $P_4$: $67200  12600$\n- $P_5$: $12600 \\leq 12600$\n- $P_6$: $252 \\leq 12600$\nThe configurations that satisfy the condition $P_i \\leq P_5$ are $(0, 10, 0)$, $(4, 2, 4)$, and $(5, 0, 5)$. The $p$-value is the sum of their probabilities:\n$$p\\text{-value} = P_1 + P_5 + P_6 = \\frac{1024}{184756} + \\frac{12600}{184756} + \\frac{252}{184756}$$\n$$p\\text{-value} = \\frac{1024 + 12600 + 252}{184756} = \\frac{13876}{184756} \\approx 0.075103998$$\nRounding this value to four significant figures gives $0.07510$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.07510}$$", "id": "2858627"}]}
