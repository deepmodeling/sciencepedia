Clonal replicates of each genotype are randomly assigned to microenvironments within blocks to disrupt any systematic association between genotype and microenvironment. The investigator fits an additive linear model for the phenotypic value, where the observed phenotype $P$ of an individual is represented as the sum of an overall mean, a genetic deviation $G$, and an environmental deviation $E$, with no explicit genotype-by-environment interaction term.

Your final reported numerical answer must be only the value of $V_G$.", "solution": "The problem statement has been critically examined and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of quantitative genetics, is well-posed, and contains sufficient, consistent information for a unique solution.\n\nThe fundamental model in quantitative genetics for partitioning the phenotypic value, $P$, of an individual is given by the sum of a genetic component, $G$, and an environmental component, $E$, when expressed as deviations from the population mean. This is represented by the linear model:\n$$P = G + E$$\nThe total phenotypic variance, $V_P$, is the variance of this sum. According to the properties of variance for the sum of two random variables, $V_P$ is defined as:\n$$V_P = \\mathrm{Var}(P) = \\mathrm{Var}(G + E)$$\nExpanding this expression gives:\n$$V_P = \\mathrm{Var}(G) + \\mathrm{Var}(E) + 2\\mathrm{Cov}(G, E)$$\nIn standard quantitative genetics notation, this is written as:\n$$V_P = V_G + V_E + 2\\mathrm{Cov}(G, E)$$\nwhere $V_G$ is the total genetic variance and $V_E$ is the environmental variance. The term $\\mathrm{Cov}(G, E)$ represents the covariance between genetic and environmental effects.\n\nThe problem statement specifies two critical conditions based on the experimental design. First, the use of a randomized complete block design has eliminated any systematic genotype-environment association, which is formally stated as:\n$$\\mathrm{Cov}(G, E) = 0$$\nSecond, the analysis of variance indicated that the genotype-by-environment interaction variance ($V_{G \\times E}$) is negligible. In the most general partitioning, $V_P = V_G + V_E + V_{G \\times E} + 2\\mathrm{Cov}(G, E)$. The provided information allows the simplification of this model.\n\nSubstituting the condition $\\mathrm{Cov}(G, E) = 0$ into the variance decomposition equation yields:\n$$V_P = V_G + V_E + 2(0)$$\n$$V_P = V_G + V_E$$\nThis simplified equation describes the partitioning of phenotypic variance under the assumption of no covariance between genotype and environment, which is a key outcome of the described randomization procedure.\n\nThe first task is to derive an expression for the genetic variance, $V_G$. By algebraic rearrangement of the simplified equation, we obtain:\n$$V_G = V_P - V_E$$\nThis is the required expression for $V_G$ in terms of $V_P$ and $V_E$, given the condition $\\mathrm{Cov}(G,E)=0$.\n\nThe next task is to compute the numerical value of $V_G$. The problem provides the following variance component estimates:\nTotal phenotypic variance, $V_P = 12$.\nEnvironmental variance, $V_E = 7$.\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived expression:\n$$V_G = 12 - 7 = 5$$\nThus, the total genetic variance is $5$.\n\nThe final task is to interpret this result. The value $V_G = 5$ represents the amount of variation in the observed phenotype (which has a total variance of $12$) that is due to genetic differences among the individuals in the population.\n\nThis result allows for the calculation of the **broad-sense heritability**, $H^2$, which is the proportion of total phenotypic variance that is due to total genetic variance:\n$$H^2 = \\frac{V_G}{V_P} = \\frac{5}{12}$$\nThis means that approximately $41.7\\%$ of the phenotypic variation observed in this plant population under these experimental conditions can be attributed to genetic factors. The experimental design, using clonal replicates, is specifically suited for estimating $V_G$, as the variance among different genotypes provides a direct measure of total genetic variance.\n\nThe interpretation in the context of **narrow-sense heritability**, $h^2$, requires a more detailed understanding of the components of genetic variance. Total genetic variance ($V_G$) is composed of additive genetic variance ($V_A$), dominance variance ($V_D$), and epistatic (interaction) variance ($V_I$):\n$$V_G = V_A + V_D + V_I$$\nNarrow-sense heritability, which predicts the evolutionary response to selection, is defined as the ratio of only the additive genetic variance to the total phenotypic variance:\n$$h^2 = \\frac{V_A}{V_P}$$\nThe experiment described allows for an estimate of $V_G = 5$, but it does not, by itself, partition this value into its additive and non-additive components. Therefore, we cannot calculate $h^2$ from the given information. The only relationship we can state definitively is that $V_A \\le V_G$, which implies $h^2 \\le H^2$.\n\nTo relate the computed $V_G$ directly to $h^2$, one must make the explicit and strong **assumption** that all genetic variance is additive, meaning $V_D = 0$ and $V_I = 0$. Under this assumption, $V_G = V_A$, and therefore $H^2 = h^2$. However, this assumption is not justified by the data provided and is often biologically incorrect. To estimate $V_A$, and thus $h^2$, a different experimental design that analyzes patterns of resemblance among relatives (e.g., parent-offspring regression or sib analysis) would be required. In summary, the computed value $V_G = 5$ represents the total genetic variance contributing to the trait, which directly yields broad-sense heritability, but its connection to narrow-sense heritability is only an inequality unless further, unverified assumptions about the genetic architecture of the trait are made.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "2821466"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond total genetic variance, this practice delves into its constituent parts: additive ($V_A$), dominance ($V_D$), and epistatic ($V_I$) variance.

We seek to determine $V_A$, $V_D$, $V_I$, and $V_P$.\n\nFirst, we solve for the total phenotypic variance, $V_P$.

The design consists of independent trios formed by randomly mating parents without assortative mating and measuring a single offspring per pair for a quantitative trait.

Let the offspring phenotype be denoted by $O$ and the midparent phenotype by $MP = (P_{\\mathrm{m}} + P_{\\mathrm{f}})/2$, where $P_{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $P_{\\mathrm{f}}$ are the phenotypes of the male and female parent, respectively.\n\nYou are given the following for $N = 160$ trios.

The ordinary least squares (OLS) method minimizes the sum of squared residuals, $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\varepsilon_i^2$. The problem states that the data have been mean-centered, which means $\\bar{O} = \\overline{MP} = 0$ if we redefine the variables as deviations from their means.

The sum of squared residuals is:\n$$S(b_{O,MP}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (o_i - b_{O,MP} mp_i)^2$$\nTo find the value of $b_{O,MP}$ that minimizes this sum, we take the derivative of $S$ with respect to $b_{O,MP}$ and set it to zero:\n$$\\frac{dS}{db_{O,MP}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{d}{db_{O,MP}}(o_i - b_{O,MP} mp_i)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} 2(o_i - b_{O,MP} mp_i)(-mp_i) = 0$$\n$$-2 \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} o_i mp_i - b_{O,MP} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} mp_i^2 \\right) = 0$$\nThis implies:\n$$b_{O,MP} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} mp_i^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} o_i mp_i$$\nSolving for $b_{O,MP}$ gives the OLS estimator, which we denote $\\hat{b}_{O,MP}$:\n$$\\hat{b}_{O,MP} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} o_i mp_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} mp_i^2} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (O_i - \\bar{O})(MP_i - \\overline{MP})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (MP_i - \\overline{MP})^2}$$\nThis is the ratio of the sample covariance of $O$ and $MP$ (multiplied by $N-1$) to the sample variance of $MP$ (multiplied by $N-1$), or more simply, the ratio of the sum of cross-products to the sum of squares of the predictor.\n\nSecond, we justify the relationship between this regression slope and narrow-sense heritability, $h^2$. The theoretical regression slope is the ratio of the population covariance to the population variance: $b_{O,MP} = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(O, MP)}{\\text{Var}(MP)}$. We analyze the numerator and denominator based on quantitative genetic principles. We use the model $P = G + E$, where $P$ is the phenotype, $G$ is the genotypic value, and $E$ is the environmental deviation. The total phenotypic variance is $V_P = V_G + V_E$, assuming $\\text{Cov}(G, E) = 0$. The genotypic variance is partitioned into additive ($V_A$), dominance ($V_D$), and epistatic ($V_I$) components: $V_G = V_A + V_D + V_I$.\nThe covariance term is:\n$$\\text{Cov}(O, MP) = \\text{Cov}\\left(P_O, \\frac{P_m + P_f}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\text{Cov}(P_O, P_m) + \\text{Cov}(P_O, P_f) \\right]$$\nwhere $P_O$, $P_m$, and $P_f$ are the phenotypes of the offspring, male parent, and female parent, respectively. The covariance between an offspring and one parent, under the stated assumptions of no shared environmental covariance and no genotype-environment correlation, is $\\text{Cov}(P_O, P_{\\text{parent}}) = \\text{Cov}(G_O, G_{\\text{parent}})$. For unrelated parents, this genetic covariance is known to be $\\frac{1}{2}V_A$. Thus:\n$$\\text{Cov}(O, MP) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}V_A + \\frac{1}{2}V_A \\right] = \\frac{1}{2}V_A$$\nThe variance term in the denominator is:\n$$\\text{Var}(MP) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{P_m + P_f}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left[ \\text{Var}(P_m) + \\text{Var}(P_f) + 2\\text{Cov}(P_m, P_f) \\right]$$\nThe problem specifies random mating without assortative mating and that pairs are unrelated, which implies $\\text{Cov}(P_m, P_f) = 0$. Assuming parents are drawn from the same population, they have the same phenotypic variance $V_P$, so $\\text{Var}(P_m) = \\text{Var}(P_f) = V_P$. Therefore:\n$$\\text{Var}(MP) = \\frac{1}{4} [V_P + V_P] = \\frac{1}{2}V_P$$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for the slope:\n$$b_{O,MP} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}V_A}{\\frac{1}{2}V_P} = \\frac{V_A}{V_P}$$\nBy definition, narrow-sense heritability is $h^2 = V_A / V_P$. Therefore, we have established that $b_{O,MP} = h^2$. A consistent estimator for heritability is the OLS slope estimator: $\\hat{h}^2 = \\hat{b}_{O,MP}$.\n\nThird, we derive the estimator for the standard error of $\\hat{h}^2$. Since $\\hat{h}^2 = \\hat{b}_{O,MP}$, a consistent estimator of its standard error is the standard error of the OLS slope estimator, $SE(\\hat{b}_{O,MP})$. From standard regression theory, the variance of the slope estimator is $\\text{Var}(\\hat{b}_{O,MP}) = \\frac{\\sigma^2_{\\varepsilon}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(MP_i - \\overline{MP})^2}$, where $\\sigma^2_{\\varepsilon}$ is the true variance of the residuals. An unbiased estimator for $\\sigma^2_{\\varepsilon}$ is the Mean Squared Error, $MSE = \\frac{SSE}{df}$, where $SSE$ is the Sum of Squared Errors and $df$ are the degrees of freedom for the residuals. For a simple linear regression with an intercept, two parameters are estimated, so $df = N - 2$. The $SSE$ can be expressed in terms of the given sums of squares:\n$$SSE = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\hat{\\varepsilon}_i^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (o_i - \\hat{b}_{O,MP} mp_i)^2 = \\sum o_i^2 - \\hat{b}_{O,MP}^2 \\sum mp_i^2$$\nUsing the notation for sums of squares and cross-products ($SS_O$, $SS_{MP}$, $SP_{O,MP}$):\n$$SSE = SS_O - \\left(\\frac{SP_{O,MP}}{SS_{MP}}\\right)^2 SS_{MP} = SS_O - \\frac{SP_{O,MP}^2}{SS_{MP}}$$\nThe estimated variance of $\\hat{h}^2$ is then:\n$$\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{h}^2) = \\frac{MSE}{SS_{MP}} = \\frac{SSE / (N-2)}{SS_{MP}} = \\frac{SS_O - SP_{O,MP}^2 / SS_{MP}}{(N-2)SS_{MP}}$$\nThe standard error of $\\hat{h}^2$ is the square root of this estimated variance:\n$$SE(\\hat{h}^2) = \\sqrt{\\frac{SS_O - SP_{O,MP}^2 / SS_{MP}}{(N-2)SS_{MP}}}$$\nNow we compute the numerical values using the provided data:\n$N = 160$, $SS_{MP} = 720.0$, $SS_{O} = 980.0$, and $SP_{O,MP} = 345.6$.\n\n1.
