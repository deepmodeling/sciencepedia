Assume Mendelian segregation, equal sex ratio, no selection, no mutation, and no migration. Adults entering the mating pool in the current generation were formed by random union of gametes, so their genotype frequencies follow the Hardy–Weinberg (HW) proportions implied by $p$ and $q$.\n\nMating is nonrandom according to the following assortative scheme: for each mating, the genotype of the first parent is sampled from the adult distribution. Conditional on that first parent’s genotype, with probability $\\alpha$ the second parent is constrained to have the same genotype (assortative-by-genotype), and with probability $1-\\alpha$ the second parent is sampled independently from the adult genotype distribution (random union of gametes). Offspring are formed by Mendelian segregation from each mating.\n\nGiven $p=0.4$ and $\\alpha=0.3$, compute the expected zygote genotype frequencies in the order $(AA,\\;Aa,\\;aa)$.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in population genetics, free from contradictions or ambiguity. All necessary data and conditions for a unique solution are provided. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem asks for the zygote genotype frequencies in the next generation under a specific model of nonrandom mating. We are given the following initial parameters:\nThe frequency of allele $A$ is $p = 0.4$.\nThe frequency of allele $a$ is $q = 1 - p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6$.\nThe assortative mating parameter is $\\alpha = 0.3$.\n\nThe parental generation has genotype frequencies that follow Hardy-Weinberg proportions, as they were formed by random union of gametes.\nThe frequency of genotype $AA$ is $P_{AA} = p^2 = (0.4)^2 = 0.16$.\nThe frequency of genotype $Aa$ is $P_{Aa} = 2pq = 2(0.4)(0.6) = 0.48$.\nThe frequency of genotype $aa$ is $P_{aa} = q^2 = (0.6)^2 = 0.36$.\nThe sum of these frequencies is $P_{AA} + P_{Aa} + P_{aa} = 0.16 + 0.48 + 0.36 = 1.0$, as required.\n\nThe mating process is defined as follows: for a given mating, a first parent of genotype $G_1$ is chosen with probability $P_{G_1}$. The second parent, $G_2$, is chosen conditional on $G_1$. With probability $\\alpha$, $G_2$ must be the same as $G_1$. With probability $1-\\alpha$, $G_2$ is chosen randomly from the population with probability $P_{G_2}$.\n\nLet us determine the frequency of each type of mating pair. The frequency of an ordered pair of parents $(G_1, G_2)$ is given by the probability of choosing the first parent, $P(G_1)$, multiplied by the conditional probability of choosing the second, $P(G_2|G_1)$.\n$$P(G_2|G_1) = \\alpha \\delta_{G_1 G_2} + (1-\\alpha) P(G_2)$$\nwhere $\\delta_{G_1 G_2}$ is the Kronecker delta, which is $1$ if $G_1 = G_2$ and $0$ otherwise.\n\nThe frequency of an unordered mating pair $\\{G_1, G_2\\}$ is what we need.\nFor matings between individuals of the same genotype ($G \\times G$):\nThe frequency is given by choosing a first parent of genotype $G$ and then a second parent of the same genotype.\n$$Freq(G \\times G) = P(G) \\times P(G|G) = P(G)[\\alpha \\cdot 1 + (1-\\alpha)P(G)] = \\alpha P(G) + (1-\\alpha)P(G)^2$$\nFor matings between individuals of different genotypes ($G_1 \\times G_2$, where $G_1 \\neq G_2$):\nThe frequency is the sum of the probabilities of the two possible ordered pairs, $(G_1, G_2)$ and $(G_2, G_1)$.\n$$Freq(G_1 \\times G_2) = P(G_1)P(G_2|G_1) + P(G_2)P(G_1|G_2)$$\n$$Freq(G_1 \\times G_2) = P(G_1)[(1-\\alpha)P(G_2)] + P(G_2)[(1-\\alpha)P(G_1)] = 2(1-\\alpha)P(G_1)P(G_2)$$\n\nNow, we calculate the frequencies of the offspring genotypes ($P'_{AA}$, $P'_{Aa}$, $P'_{aa}$) by summing the contributions from each mating type, weighted by their respective frequencies and Mendelian segregation ratios.\n\nThe frequency of $AA$ offspring, $P'_{AA}$, is:\n$$P'_{AA} = Freq(AA \\times AA) \\cdot 1 + Freq(AA \\times Aa) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + Freq(Aa \\times Aa) \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for mating frequencies:\n$$P'_{AA} = [\\alpha P_{AA} + (1-\\alpha)P_{AA}^2] + \\frac{1}{2}[2(1-\\alpha)P_{AA}P_{Aa}] + \\frac{1}{4}[\\alpha P_{Aa} + (1-\\alpha)P_{Aa}^2]$$\n$$P'_{AA} = \\alpha P_{AA} + \\frac{\\alpha}{4}P_{Aa} + (1-\\alpha) \\left[ P_{AA}^2 + P_{AA}P_{Aa} + \\frac{1}{4}P_{Aa}^2 \\right]$$\nSubstitute $P_{AA} = p^2$ and $P_{Aa} = 2pq$:\n$$P'_{AA} = \\alpha p^2 + \\frac{\\alpha}{4}(2pq) + (1-\\alpha) \\left[ (p^2)^2 + p^2(2pq) + \\frac{1}{4}(2pq)^2 \\right]$$\n$$P'_{AA} = \\alpha p^2 + \\frac{\\alpha pq}{2} + (1-\\alpha) \\left[ p^4 + 2p^3q + p^2q^2 \\right]$$\n$$P'_{AA} = \\alpha p^2 + \\frac{\\alpha pq}{2} + (1-\\alpha) p^2 (p^2 + 2pq + q^2)$$\n$$P'_{AA} = \\alpha p^2 + \\frac{\\alpha pq}{2} + (1-\\alpha) p^2 (p+q)^2 = \\alpha p^2 + \\frac{\\alpha pq}{2} + (1-\\alpha) p^2$$\n$$P'_{AA} = p^2 + \\frac{\\alpha pq}{2}$$\n\nBy symmetry, replacing $p$ with $q$, the frequency of $aa$ offspring is:\n$$P'_{aa} = q^2 + \\frac{\\alpha pq}{2}$$\n\nThe frequency of $Aa$ offspring, $P'_{Aa}$, can be found by subtraction, since $P'_{AA} + P'_{Aa} + P'_{aa} = 1$:\n$$P'_{Aa} = 1 - P'_{AA} - P'_{aa} = 1 - \\left(p^2 + \\frac{\\alpha pq}{2}\\right) - \\left(q^2 + \\frac{\\alpha pq}{2}\\right)$$\n$$P'_{Aa} = 1 - p^2 - q^2 - \\alpha pq$$\nUsing the identity $p^2 + q^2 = (p+q)^2 - 2pq = 1 - 2pq$:\n$$P'_{Aa} = 1 - (1 - 2pq) - \\alpha pq = 2pq - \\alpha pq$$\n\nAs a necessary check, we verify that the allele frequencies are unchanged.

It describes a classic scenario in population genetics known as the Wahlund effect, which demonstrates a deficit of heterozygotes when distinct subpopulations are pooled and analyzed as a single unit. All necessary parameters ($w_1$, $w_2$, $p_1$, $p_2$) are provided, and they are consistent ($w_1 + w_2 = 0.30 + 0.70 = 1.0$). The definitions of the terms required for the calculation are explicitly stated.\n\nIt must be noted that the problem's use of the symbol $F_{IS}$ is non-standard. The quantity $F_{IS}$ typically measures the effects of non-random mating within a subpopulation relative to that subpopulation's allele frequencies. Given the premise of random mating within subpopulations, the true $F_{IS}$ for $S_1$ and $S_2$ is $0$. The formula provided, $1 - H_{\\mathrm{obs}}/H_{\\mathrm{exp}}$, where $H_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ is the average heterozygosity across subpopulations and $H_{\\mathrm{exp}}$ is the expected heterozygosity of the total population, actually defines Wright's fixation index $F_{ST}$. This index measures the effect of population subdivision. However, because the problem provides an explicit, unambiguous local definition for the quantity it labels \"$F_{IS}$\", the terminological inconsistency does not render the problem invalid or ill-posed. We shall proceed by calculating the value according to the specific formula given.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of a quantity defined as $F_{IS} = 1 - H_{\\mathrm{obs}}/H_{\\mathrm{exp}}$. This will be done in three stages: first, calculating the expected heterozygosity in the total population, $H_{\\mathrm{exp}}$; second, calculating the observed heterozygosity in the pooled sample, $H_{\\mathrm{obs}}$; and third, substituting these values into the given formula.\n\nFirst, we determine the allele frequency of $A$ in the total, pooled population, denoted as $p_T$. This is the weighted average of the allele frequencies in the two subpopulations, where the weights are their relative contributions to the pool.\n$$p_T = w_1 p_1 + w_2 p_2$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$p_T = (0.30)(0.20) + (0.70)(0.80) = 0.06 + 0.56 = 0.62$$\nThe frequency of allele $a$ in the total population, $q_T$, is therefore:\n$$q_T = 1 - p_T = 1 - 0.62 = 0.38$$\nThe expected heterozygosity, $H_{\\mathrm{exp}}$, is the frequency of heterozygotes ($Aa$) expected under Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium for the total population with allele frequencies $p_T$ and $q_T$.\n$$H_{\\mathrm{exp}} = 2 p_T q_T$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{exp}} = 2 (0.62)(0.38) = 0.4712$$\n\nNext, we calculate the \"observed\" heterozygosity of the pooled sample, $H_{\\mathrm{obs}}$. The problem states that each subpopulation is in HWE. This means the actual frequency of heterozygotes within subpopulation $S_i$ is given by $H_i = 2 p_i q_i$. The pooled observed heterozygosity is the weighted average of these within-subpopulation heterozygosities.\n\nFor subpopulation $S_1$:\nThe frequency of allele $a$ is $q_1 = 1 - p_1 = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\nThe heterozygosity is $H_1 = 2 p_1 q_1 = 2 (0.20)(0.80) = 0.32$.\n\nFor subpopulation $S_2$:\nThe frequency of allele $a$ is $q_2 = 1 - p_2 = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$.\nThe heterozygosity is $H_2 = 2 p_2 q_2 = 2 (0.80)(0.20) = 0.32$.\n\nThe pooled observed heterozygosity, $H_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, is the weighted average of $H_1$ and $H_2$:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{obs}} = w_1 H_1 + w_2 H_2$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{obs}} = (0.30)(0.32) + (0.70)(0.32) = (0.30 + 0.70)(0.32) = (1.0)(0.32) = 0.32$$\n\nFinally, we compute the value of the index as defined in the problem statement:\n$$F_{IS} = 1 - \\frac{H_{\\mathrm{obs}}}{H_{\\mathrm{exp}}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for $H_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ and $H_{\\mathrm{exp}}$:\n$$F_{IS} = 1 - \\frac{0.32}{0.4712}$$\n$$F_{IS} = 1 - 0.679117147...$$\n$$F_{IS} = 0.320882852...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$F_{IS} \\approx 0.3209$$\nThis result quantifies the deficit of heterozygotes in the pooled sample compared to Hardy-Weinberg expectations for that sample, a direct consequence of the Wahlund effect due to population subdivision.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3209}$$", "id": "2832903"}, {"introduction": "This final exercise elevates our analysis from static, single-generation calculations to dynamic, multi-generational simulation.

It is a well-defined, scientifically sound problem in population genetics. A solution will now be derived and implemented.\n\n### Derivation of Recurrence Relations\n\nThe core of the simulation is the update rule for genotype frequencies from generation $t$ to $t+1$. Let the frequencies at generation $t$ be $x_{AA}$, $x_{Aa}$, and $x_{aa}$. The allele frequency of $A$ is $p = x_{AA} + \\frac{1}{2}x_{Aa}$, and for $a$ it is $q = 1-p$. The genotype frequencies at generation $t+1$, denoted $x'_{AA}$, $x'_{Aa}$, $x'_{aa}$, are a weighted sum of the outcomes from assortative mating (proportion $s$) and random mating (proportion $1-s$).\n\n$x'_{\\text{genotype}} = s \\cdot x'_{\\text{genotype, assortative}} + (1-s) \\cdot x'_{\\text{genotype, random}}$\n\nThe random mating component always results in Hardy-Weinberg proportions based on the parental allele frequencies:\n$x'_{AA, \\text{random}} = p^2$\n$x'_{Aa, \\text{random}} = 2pq$\n$x'_{aa, \\text{random}} = q^2$\n\nThe assortative component depends on the regime.\n\n**1. Genotype-Assortative Regime**\nMating occurs only between individuals of the same genotype.\n- The mating $AA \\times AA$ has frequency $x_{AA}$ and produces only $AA$ offspring.\n- The mating $Aa \\times Aa$ has frequency $x_{Aa}$ and produces offspring in proportions $\\frac{1}{4}AA : \\frac{1}{2}Aa : \\frac{1}{4}aa$.\n- The mating $aa \\times aa$ has frequency $x_{aa}$ and produces only $aa$ offspring.\n\nThe resulting offspring frequencies under pure genotype-assortative mating are:\n$x'_{AA, \\text{assort(G)}} = x_{AA} + \\frac{1}{4}x_{Aa}$\n$x'_{Aa, \\text{assort(G)}} = \\frac{1}{2}x_{Aa}$\n$x'_{aa, \\text{assort(G)}} = x_{aa} + \\frac{1}{4}x_{Aa}$\n\nCombining these with the random mating component gives the full recurrence relations for Regime G:\n$x'_{AA} = s \\left( x_{AA} + \\frac{1}{4}x_{Aa} \\right) + (1-s) p^2$\n$x'_{Aa} = s \\left( \\frac{1}{2}x_{Aa} \\right) + (1-s) 2pq$\n$x'_{aa} = s \\left( x_{aa} + \\frac{1}{4}x_{Aa} \\right) + (1-s) q^2$\n\n**2. Phenotype-Assortative Regime**\nMating occurs between individuals of the same phenotype. With complete dominance, the phenotypes are 'dominant' (D) for genotypes $AA$ and $Aa$, and 'recessive' (r) for genotype $aa$. The frequency of the dominant phenotype is $x_D = x_{AA} + x_{Aa}$, and the recessive phenotype is $x_r = x_{aa}$.\n- Mating within the recessive class (r $\\times$ r) is simply $aa \\times aa$, occurring with frequency $x_{aa}$. All offspring are $aa$.\n- Mating within the dominant class (D $\\times$ D) occurs with frequency $x_D$. Within this sub-population, individuals mate randomly. The allele frequencies within the dominant group are $p_D = \\frac{x_{AA} + \\frac{1}{2}x_{Aa}}{x_{AA}+x_{Aa}} = \\frac{p}{x_D}$ for allele $A$, and $q_D = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}x_{Aa}}{x_{AA}+x_{Aa}}$ for allele $a$. Random mating within this group produces offspring genotypes in HWE proportions relative to $p_D$ and $q_D$. The contribution to the total offspring population is scaled by $x_D$.\n\nIf $x_D  0$, the resulting offspring frequencies under pure phenotype-assortative mating are:\n$x'_{AA, \\text{assort(P)}} = x_D \\cdot p_D^2 = x_D \\left(\\frac{p}{x_D}\\right)^2 = \\frac{p^2}{x_D}$\n$x'_{Aa, \\text{assort(P)}} = x_D \\cdot 2p_D q_D = x_D \\cdot 2 \\frac{p}{x_D} \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}x_{Aa}}{x_D} = \\frac{p \\cdot x_{Aa}}{x_D}$\n$x'_{aa, \\text{assort(P)}} = x_{aa} + x_D \\cdot q_D^2 = x_{aa} + x_D \\left(\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}x_{Aa}}{x_D}\\right)^2 = x_{aa} + \\frac{(\\frac{1}{2}x_{Aa})^2}{x_D}$\nIf $x_D = 0$, the population consists entirely of $aa$ individuals, so all offspring must also be $aa$.\n\nCombining these with the random mating component gives the full recurrence relations for Regime P:\n$x'_{AA} = s \\left( \\frac{p^2}{x_D} \\right) + (1-s) p^2$\n$x'_{Aa} = s \\left( \\frac{p \\cdot x_{Aa}}{x_D} \\right) + (1-s) 2pq$\n$x'_{aa} = s \\left( x_{aa} + \\frac{(\\frac{1}{2}x_{Aa})^2}{x_D} \\right) + (1-s) q^2$\n(with the condition that for $x_D=0$, the assortative components are $0, 0, 1$ respectively).\n\n**Allele Frequency Dynamics**\nFor both regimes, algebraic substitution reveals that $p' = x'_{AA} + \\frac{1}{2}x'_{Aa} = p$. The mating system itself does not alter allele frequencies. Therefore, we expect $p(t) = p(0)$ for all $t$, and thus $\\Delta p = p(T) - p(0) = 0$.\n\n### Algorithm and Implementation\n\nThe simulation proceeds as follows:\n1.  Initialize genotype frequencies $x_{AA}(0)$, $x_{Aa}(0)$, $x_{aa}(0)$ from the given $p(0)$ and $F(0)$.\n    $x_{Aa}(0) = 2p(0)(1-p(0))(1-F(0))$\n    $x_{AA}(0) = p(0)^2 + p(0)(1-p(0))F(0)$\n    $x_{aa}(0) = (1-p(0))^2 + p(0)(1-p(0))F(0)$\n2.  For each generation from $t=0$ to $t=T-1$:\n    a. Calculate current allele frequency $p(t)$ from current genotype frequencies.\n    b. Apply the appropriate recurrence relations (Regime G or P) to compute $x_{AA}(t+1)$, $x_{Aa}(t+1)$, $x_{aa}(t+1)$.\n3.  After $T$ generations, the final frequencies $x_{AA}(T)$, $x_{Aa}(T)$, $x_{aa}(T)$ are obtained.\n4.  Compute the required output metrics:\n    - $H(T) = x_{Aa}(T)$\n    - $p(T) = x_{AA}(T) + \\frac{1}{2}x_{Aa}(T)$\n    - $F(T) = 1 - \\frac{H(T)}{2p(T)(1-p(T))}$ (valid since $p(T)=p(0)$ and no test case has $p(0)=0$ or $1$).\n    - $\\Delta p = p(T) - p(0)$.\nThis process is executed for each test case and for both mating regimes.
