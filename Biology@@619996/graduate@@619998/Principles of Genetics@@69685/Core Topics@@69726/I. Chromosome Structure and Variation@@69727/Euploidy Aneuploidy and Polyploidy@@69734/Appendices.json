In an allopolyploid, $4x$ indicates that the organism carries four monoploid sets derived from two distinct ancestral genomes, consistent with euploid multiplication of the base set.\n\nUsing only these foundational definitions and the given notation, interpret the ploidy level implied by $4x$ and compute the gametic chromosome number $n$ and the base number $x$.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and uses standard, objective terminology from the field of cytogenetics. All necessary information is provided and is internally consistent. We shall proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe problem provides the cytogenetic notation for an allopolyploid plant: $2n = 4x = 48$. The definitions of the symbols are given as:\n- $2n$: the somatic chromosome number.\n- $n$: the gametic chromosome number, which is the number of chromosomes in a meiotically produced haploid cell (gamete).\n- $x$: the monoploid base number, which is the number of chromosomes in a single fundamental genomic set.\n\nThe notation $4x$ signifies that the organism is tetraploid, meaning its somatic cells contain four monoploid sets of chromosomes. The term \"allopolyploid\" specifies that these sets derive from at least two different ancestral species.\n\nFrom the compound equality $2n = 4x = 48$, we can extract two distinct equations to solve for the two unknowns, $n$ and $x$.\n\nFirst, we use the relationship for the somatic chromosome number:\n$$2n = 48$$\nThis equation directly relates the total chromosome count in a somatic cell ($48$) to the symbol $2n$. The gametic number, $n$, is by definition half of the somatic number. To find $n$, we simply divide by $2$.\n$$n = \\frac{48}{2}$$\n$$n = 24$$\nThus, the gametes of this plant contain $24$ chromosomes.\n\nSecond, we use the relationship for the ploidy level:\n$$4x = 48$$\nThis equation defines the total somatic chromosome count ($48$) in terms of the monoploid base number, $x$. The coefficient $4$ indicates the ploidy level (tetraploid). To find the base number $x$, we divide by $4$.\n$$x = \\frac{48}{4}$$\n$$x = 12$$\nThis indicates that the fundamental genomic set for this polyploid series consists of $12$ chromosomes.\n\nThe results are consistent. The organism is an allotetraploid ($4x$) with a somatic number of $48$. During meiosis, it functions as a diploid, pairing homologous chromosomes from its distinct ancestral genomes. Consequently, it produces gametes that contain two full monoploid sets, making the gametic number $n = 2x = 2 \\times 12 = 24$. This matches our calculation for $n$ from the $2n = 48$ relation.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be presented as a row matrix $(n \\;\\; x)$.

Triploid organisms ($3x$) are notoriously infertile, a phenomenon that can be explained by the mechanics of meiosis. This practice challenges you to model this process quantitatively, using probability and the principle of independent assortment to predict the frequency of 'balanced' gametes produced by a triploid [@problem_id:2810137]. This exercise provides a powerful, quantitative illustration of why odd-numbered polyploids struggle to reproduce sexually.", "problem": "A triploid organism has three homologs for each chromosome and therefore experiences irregular pairing at meiosis, typically forming trivalents. Consider a plant species with haploid base chromosome number $x$ (the number of distinct chromosome types per monoploid set). In a triploid ($3x$), assume the following biological and probabilistic model, grounded in standard meiotic behavior and the Principle of Independent Assortment:\n\n- At Meiosis I (MI), for each set of three homologs forming a trivalent, segregation is $2{:}1$ (two homologs to one pole and one homolog to the other) with no $3{:}0$ events. The direction of $2{:}1$ segregation for each trivalent is equiprobable between the two poles.\n- The $x$ trivalents segregate independently of one another.\n- Meiosis II (MII) separates sister chromatids without altering the number of homologs per chromosome that each MI product carries; consequently, the copy number per chromosome in a final gamete equals the number of homologs that entered its MI precursor.\n- A gamete is defined as dosage-balanced (and thus potentially fertile) if and only if it carries exactly one copy of every chromosome ($n=x$) or exactly two copies of every chromosome ($n=2x$). Any mixture of one and two across different chromosomes is considered unbalanced. Ignore post-meiotic selection and any viability differences between the two balanced classes.\n\nUsing only these assumptions and core definitions of euploidy and independent assortment, derive the expected proportion of balanced gametes as a function of $x$. Then, evaluate this proportion for $x=12$. Express your final numerical answer as an exact fraction. Do not use a percent sign and do not round.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. It presents a simplified but valid probabilistic model of meiotic segregation in a triploid organism, based on established principles of genetics. The assumptions are clearly articulated, and the objective is mathematically formalizable. Therefore, a rigorous solution can be derived.\n\nThe fundamental task is to calculate the probability that a gamete produced by a triploid organism ($3x$) is 'balanced'. A balanced gamete is defined as one containing a complete monoploid set of chromosomes ($n=x$) or a complete diploid set ($n=2x$). Any other combination of chromosome copy numbers is aneuploid and thus considered unbalanced.\n\nLet $x$ be the haploid base chromosome number. The triploid organism has $x$ sets of homologous chromosomes, with each set, or trivalent, containing $3$ homologs.\n\nFirst, consider the segregation of a single trivalent, corresponding to a single chromosome type. The problem states that at Meiosis I, the three homologs segregate in a $2:1$ ratio. This means one secondary meiocyte receives one homolog, and the other receives two homologs. The direction of this segregation is equiprobable. Let us denote the two poles of the meiotic spindle as Pole A and Pole B. The following two outcomes are possible for a given trivalent, each with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$:\n1. Pole A receives $1$ homolog; Pole B receives $2$ homologs.\n2. Pole A receives $2$ homologs; Pole B receives $1$ homolog.\n\nAfter Meiosis I, two secondary meiocytes are formed. After Meiosis II, each secondary meiocyte produces two gametes whose chromosome copy number for this specific type is determined by the result of Meiosis I segregation. If a secondary meiocyte received $k$ homologs, the gametes derived from it will also contain $k$ copies of that chromosome.\n\nTherefore, for any single chromosome type, the pool of gametes produced will consist of two types: those with one copy of the chromosome and those with two copies. Due to the equiprobable nature of the $2:1$ segregation direction, a randomly selected gamete has a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ of containing one copy of this chromosome and a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ of containing two copies. Let $c_i$ be the number of copies of chromosome $i$ in a gamete, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, x\\}$. Then, for any $i$:\n$$P(c_i = 1) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$P(c_i = 2) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThe problem states that the $x$ trivalents segregate independently. This is a direct application of the Principle of Independent Assortment extended to this meiotic model.\n\nA gamete is defined as balanced if it is either euploid at the $n=x$ level or euploid at the $n=2x$ level. These two conditions are mutually exclusive. Let $P_{bal}$ be the total probability of a gamete being balanced.\n$$P_{bal} = P(\\text{gamete is } n=x) + P(\\text{gamete is } n=2x)$$\n\nLet us calculate the probability for each case.\n\nCase 1: The gamete is of type $n=x$.\nThis requires the gamete to have exactly one copy of *every* chromosome type from $1$ to $x$. This means $c_i=1$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, x\\}$. Due to the independence of segregation for each trivalent, the probability of this specific combination is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$P(\\text{gamete is } n=x) = P(c_1=1 \\text{ and } c_2=1 \\text{ and } \\dots \\text{ and } c_x=1)$$\n$$P(\\text{gamete is } n=x) = \\prod_{i=1}^{x} P(c_i=1) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^x$$\n\nCase 2: The gamete is of type $n=2x$.\nThis requires the gamete to have exactly two copies of *every* chromosome type from $1$ to $x$. This means $c_i=2$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, x\\}$. Again, due to independence, the probability is:\n$$P(\\text{gamete is } n=2x) = P(c_1=2 \\text{ and } c_2=2 \\text{ and } \\dots \\text{ and } c_x=2)$$\n$$P(\\text{gamete is } n=2x) = \\prod_{i=1}^{x} P(c_i=2) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^x$$\n\nThe total proportion of balanced gametes is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive outcomes:\n$$P_{bal}(x) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^x + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^x = 2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^x = \\frac{2}{2^x} = \\frac{1}{2^{x-1}}$$\nThis is the general expression for the expected proportion of balanced gametes as a function of the base chromosome number $x$.\n\nThe problem then requires the evaluation of this proportion for a species with $x=12$. Substituting $x=12$ into the derived formula yields:\n$$P_{bal}(12) = \\frac{1}{2^{12-1}} = \\frac{1}{2^{11}}$$\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we compute the value of $2^{11}$:\n$$2^{10} = 1024$$\n$$2^{11} = 2 \\times 2^{10} = 2 \\times 1024 = 2048$$\nThus, the proportion of balanced gametes for $x=12$ is $\\frac{1}{2048}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2048}}$$", "id": "2810137"}, {"introduction": "While triploids are often a reproductive dead-end, tetraploids ($4x$) are common and stable in many plant lineages.

The observed counts ($O_i$) for the five genotype classes are given as $O = (18, 130, 282, 130, 16)$ for the genotypes $AAAA$, $AAAa$, $AAaa$, $Aaaa$, and $aaaa$, respectively. The total number of individuals is $N=576$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the tetrasomic (autotetraploid) model.\nIn an F1 individual with genotype $AAaa$, the four homologous chromosomes pair randomly. This is known as chromosome segregation. The gametes produced are diploid. The possible gamete genotypes are $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$.

Each cross independently produces offspring in the Mendelian ratio $1:2:1$.
