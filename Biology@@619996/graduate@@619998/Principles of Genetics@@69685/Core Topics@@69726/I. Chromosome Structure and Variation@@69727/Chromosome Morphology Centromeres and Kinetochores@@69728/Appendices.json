The Nuclear division cycle 80 (Ndc80) complex is a core microtubule-binding element that forms multiple attachments per microtubule and is thought to bear tensile load under metaphase tension. Assume the following fundamental bases: (i) counts of independent constituents combine multiplicatively across hierarchical levels (for example, the total copy number across a bundle is the product of the number of elements in the bundle and the average copy number per element), and (ii) for a set of mechanically identical, parallel load-bearing linkers undergoing small elastic deformations, the total force is the sum of forces across linkers and load is shared equally among the engaged linkers.\n\nLet a single kinetochore bind $m$ kinetochore microtubules, and let the average number of Ndc80 complexes per microtubule be $n$.

The validity of the problem is confirmed, as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of cell biology and biophysics, is well-posed, and provides all necessary information for a unique solution. We proceed directly to the derivation.\n\nLet the variables be defined as follows:\n- $m$: the number of kinetochore microtubules bound to a single kinetochore.\n- $n$: the average number of Ndc80 complexes per microtubule.\n- $F$: the total poleward tension acting on the kinetochore.\n- $f$: the fraction of Ndc80 complexes that are mechanically engaged at any instant.\n- $L$: the load per engaged Ndc80 complex.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the total number of Ndc80 complexes per kinetochore.\nLet $N_{total}$ represent the total number of Ndc80 complexes associated with one kinetochore. The problem describes a hierarchical system where one kinetochore binds $m$ microtubules, and each microtubule is associated with an average of $n$ Ndc80 complexes. According to the explicitly stated fundamental basis (i), \"counts of independent constituents combine multiplicatively across hierarchical levels\". Therefore, the total number of complexes is the product of the number of elements at each level of the hierarchy.\nThe total number of Ndc80 complexes per kinetochore is the number of microtubules per kinetochore multiplied by the number of complexes per microtubule:\n$$N_{total} = m \\times n$$\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the load per engaged Ndc80 complex.\nThe total population of Ndc80 complexes is $N_{total}$, but only a fraction $f$ of these is load-bearing. The number of engaged complexes, which we denote as $N_{engaged}$, is given by:\n$$N_{engaged} = f \\times N_{total}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $N_{total}$ from Part 1, we obtain:\n$$N_{engaged} = f \\times m \\times n$$\nThe total force $F$ is distributed among these $N_{engaged}$ linkers. The problem states as basis (ii) the \"equal-load-sharing assumption\". This assumption is justified by modeling the engaged Ndc80 complexes as a set of identical, parallel elastic linkers operating in the regime of small deformations. In such a model, each linker can be treated as an ideal spring with spring constant $k$. For a parallel arrangement of $N_{engaged}$ springs, the total force required to produce a displacement $\\Delta x$ is $F = N_{engaged} \\times (k \\Delta x)$. The force on any individual spring is $L = k \\Delta x$. From these two relations, it is clear that $L = \\frac{F}{N_{engaged}}$, which is the mathematical statement of equal load sharing.\n\nTherefore, the load $L$ on a single engaged Ndc80 complex is the total tension $F$ divided by the number of engaged complexes $N_{engaged}$:\n$$L = \\frac{F}{N_{engaged}}$$\nBy substituting our expression for $N_{engaged}$, we arrive at the final expression for the per-complex load in terms of the given parameters:\n$$L = \\frac{F}{f \\times m \\times n}$$\nAs requested, we comment on the role of $f$. The per-complex load $L$ is inversely proportional to the fraction of engaged linkers $f$. The total number of Ndc80 complexes $N_{total} = m \\times n$ represents the static, structural composition of the interface. However, $f$, a dynamic parameter, dictates how many of these complexes are actively resisting force at a given moment. A smaller $f$ implies that the total load $F$ is concentrated onto fewer molecular supports, thereby increasing the stress $L$ on each one. This modulation of load concentration is a critical feature of such molecular systems, allowing for dynamic regulation of mechanical stability.\n\nPart 3: Numerical evaluation of $L$.\nWe are provided with the following values:\n- $m = 18$\n- $n = 13$\n- $f = 0.7$\n- $F = 72\\,\\mathrm{pN}$\n\nWe substitute these numerical values into our derived expression for $L$:\n$$L = \\frac{72}{0.7 \\times 18 \\times 13}$$\nFirst, we compute the product in the denominator, which is the number of engaged complexes, $N_{engaged}$:\n$$N_{engaged} = 0.7 \\times 18 \\times 13 = 163.8$$\nNow, we can calculate the load $L$:\n$$L = \\frac{72}{163.8} \\approx 0.43956043956\\,\\mathrm{pN}$$\nThe problem demands the answer be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$L \\approx 0.4396\\,\\mathrm{pN}$$\nThis is the calculated load per engaged Ndc80 complex under the specified conditions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.4396}\n$$", "id": "2798912"}, {"introduction": "While the kinetochore provides the attachment point, the region between sister kinetochores, the centromere, acts like a spring resisting the constant pull of the spindle.

We now substitute back in terms of $x(t)$. The initial displacement is $y(0) = x(0) - x_{\\infty}$. The problem statement defines this initial recoil amplitude as $A = x(0) - x_{\\infty}$. Therefore, the solution for the displacement is:\n$$ x(t) - x_{\\infty} = A \\, e^{-t/\\tau} $$\nSolving for $x(t)$, we obtain the final functional form of the model to be used for data fitting:\n$$ x(t) = x_{\\infty} + A \\, e^{-t/\\tau} $$\nThis model has three parameters to be determined from experimental data: the final equilibrium distance $x_{\\infty}$, the initial recoil amplitude $A$, and the relaxation time $\\tau$.\n\nThe second task is to estimate the physical parameters $k$ and $\\gamma$ for each of the $4$ experimental conditions.

Thus, the stiffness is estimated as:\n$$ \\hat{k} = \\frac{F_0}{\\hat{A}} $$\nThe relaxation time $\\tau$ is defined as $\\tau = \\gamma/k$. Therefore, the viscous damping coefficient is estimated as:\n$$ \\hat{\\gamma} = \\hat{\\tau} \\hat{k} $$\nThese calculations will be performed for each of the $4$ conditions. The resulting values for $\\hat{k}$ and $\\hat{\\gamma}$ will be rounded to $3$ decimal places as required.\n\nFinally, the estimated stiffness values $\\{\\hat{k}_0, \\hat{k}_1, \\hat{k}_2, \\hat{k}_3\\}$ and damping coefficients $\\{\\hat{\\gamma}_0, \\hat{\\gamma}_1, \\hat{\\gamma}_2, \\hat{\\gamma}_3\\}$ will be compared to find the indices of the conditions with the maximum stiffness, $i_{k,\\max}$, and maximum damping, $i_{\\gamma,\\max}$.
