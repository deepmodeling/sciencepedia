The description of paracentric inversions, inversion loops, and the products of single crossovers is factually correct.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides clear, formal definitions for all necessary terms (e.g., \"balanced chromatid\", \"$2/3/4$-strand crossover\"). The initial conditions and the question are stated precisely, allowing for a unique, derivable solution.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical and devoid of subjective or ambiguous phrasing.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a standard, well-posed problem in genetics. I will proceed with a full derivation of the solution.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nLet the four chromatids at the start of meiosis I be denoted as follows:\n- Chromatids $1$ and $2$: Sister chromatids from the non-inverted (normal) homolog.\n- Chromatids $3$ and $4$: Sister chromatids from the inverted homolog.\n\nCrossing over occurs between non-sister chromatids. The key insight, prompted by the problem statement, lies in the \"parity of crossover participation per chromatid\". A single crossover ($1$ exchange, an odd number) between a normal and an inverted chromatid within a paracentric inversion loop is known to result in unbalanced gametes derived from the two participating chromatids. One recombinant product is a dicentric chromatid (two centromeres) with duplications and deletions, which forms a bridge at anaphase I. The other is an acentric fragment (no centromere) with deletions, which is typically lost. A chromatid participating in an odd number of exchanges will be unbalanced. Conversely, a chromatid participating in an even number of exchanges ($0$, $2$, $4$, ...) will be balanced, as the exchanges effectively cancel each other out in terms of final gene content and centricity.\n\nLet us analyze each type of double crossover based on this principle.\n\n**1. $2$-strand double crossover**\nIn this configuration, both crossovers occur between the same two non-sister chromatids, for example, chromatid $2$ (normal) and chromatid $3$ (inverted).\n- Chromatid $1$ (normal): Participates in $0$ exchanges (even). It remains a parental non-recombinant chromatid. Result: **Balanced**.\n- Chromatid $2$ (normal): Participates in $2$ exchanges (even). The two exchanges with chromatid $3$ result in the swapping of the segment between the crossover points. The resulting chromatid is monocentric and contains a complete set of genes, but now in the inverted arrangement. Result: **Balanced**.\n- Chromatid $3$ (inverted): Participates in $2$ exchanges (even). It reciprocally swaps a segment with chromatid $2$. The resulting chromatid is monocentric and contains a complete set of genes, but now in the normal arrangement. Result: **Balanced**.\n- Chromatid $4$ (inverted): Participates in $0$ exchanges (even). It remains a parental non-recombinant chromatid. Result: **Balanced**.\nConclusion: A $2$-strand double crossover yields a total of $4$ balanced chromatids.\n\n**2. $3$-strand double crossover**\nIn this configuration, one chromatid is involved in both exchanges, while two other non-sister chromatids are each involved in one. For example, one crossover occurs between chromatid $2$ (normal) and chromatid $3$ (inverted), and the second crossover occurs between chromatid $2$ (normal) and chromatid $4$ (inverted).\n- Chromatid $1$ (normal): Participates in $0$ exchanges (even). It is a parental non-recombinant chromatid. Result: **Balanced**.\n- Chromatid $2$ (normal): Participates in $2$ exchanges (even), one with chromatid $3$ and one with chromatid $4$. According to the parity rule, this chromatid should be balanced. It is monocentric and its genetic content is restored. Result: **Balanced**.\n- Chromatid $3$ (inverted): Participates in $1$ exchange (odd) with chromatid $2$. It will become one of the unbalanced products (part of a dicentric bridge or an acentric fragment). Result: **Unbalanced**.\n- Chromatid $4$ (inverted): Participates in $1$ exchange (odd) with chromatid $2$. It will also become an unbalanced product. Result: **Unbalanced**.\nConclusion: A $3$-strand double crossover yields a total of $2$ balanced chromatids and $2$ unbalanced chromatids.\n\n**3. $4$-strand double crossover**\nIn this configuration, the two crossovers involve four distinct chromatids. For example, one crossover occurs between chromatid $2$ (normal) and chromatid $3$ (inverted), and the second crossover occurs between chromatid $1$ (normal) and chromatid $4$ (inverted).\n- Chromatid $1$ (normal): Participates in $1$ exchange (odd) with chromatid $4$. Result: **Unbalanced**.\n- Chromatid $2$ (normal): Participates in $1$ exchange (odd) with chromatid $3$. Result: **Unbalanced**.\n- Chromatid $3$ (inverted): Participates in $1$ exchange (odd) with chromatid $2$. Result: **Unbalanced**.\n- Chromatid $4$ (inverted): Participates in $1$ exchange (odd) with chromatid $1$. Result: **Unbalanced**.\nConclusion: A $4$-strand double crossover is equivalent to two separate single-crossover events. Each of the four participating chromatids is involved in an odd number of exchanges, leading to the formation of two dicentric chromatids and two acentric fragments. This yields a total of $0$ balanced chromatids.\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n- $2$-strand double crossover: $4$ balanced, $0$ unbalanced chromatids.\n- $3$-strand double crossover: $2$ balanced, $2$ unbalanced chromatids.\n- $4$-strand double crossover: $0$ balanced, $4$ unbalanced chromatids.\n\nNow, I will evaluate the given options based on this derivation.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A.

No numerical rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement submitted for analysis is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of meiotic genetics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objectively formulated. We shall proceed with a rigorous derivation from first principles.\n\nLet $N$ be the random variable representing the number of crossover events within the inverted chromosomal segment on a bivalent during meiosis. According to the problem statement, crossovers occur as a spatial Poisson process with no interference. Therefore, $N$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu$, where $\\mu$ is the expected number of crossovers per bivalent in this interval. The probability mass function is given by:\n$$P(N=k) = \\frac{e^{-\\mu} \\mu^k}{k!}, \\quad k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\}$$\n\nThe problem defines the genetic length $g$ in Morgans as the expected number of crossovers per chromatid within the interval. A bivalent consists of $4$ chromatids. A single crossover event involves $2$ of these $4$ chromatids. Therefore, for a given crossover event, any specific chromatid has a probability of $\\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$ of being involved. By linearity of expectation, the expected number of exchanges for a single chromatid is half the expected number of crossovers for the bivalent.\n$$g = E[\\text{exchanges per chromatid}] = E[N] \\times \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{\\mu}{2}$$\nFrom this, we establish the relationship between the Poisson parameter $\\mu$ and the given genetic length $g$:\n$$\\mu = 2g$$\nSubstituting this into the probability mass function for $N$:\n$$P(N=k) = \\frac{e^{-2g} (2g)^k}{k!}$$\n\nThe viability of a resulting gamete depends on whether its constituent chromatid is genetically balanced. A chromatid is balanced if it has undergone an even number of exchanges within the inverted region. We must determine the probability of this outcome.\n\nConsider a meiotic event where exactly $k$ crossovers have occurred on the bivalent ($N=k$). Let $M$ be the random variable for the number of exchanges a single, specific chromatid experiences. With no chromatid interference, the involvement of this chromatid in each of the $k$ crossovers is an independent Bernoulli trial with a success probability of $p = \\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the number of exchanges $M$ for this chromatid, conditioned on $N=k$, follows a binomial distribution:\n$$M | (N=k) \\sim \\text{Binomial}\\left(k, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\nThe probability of this chromatid undergoing exactly $m$ exchanges is:\n$$P(M=m | N=k) = \\binom{k}{m} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^m \\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{k-m} = \\binom{k}{m} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k$$\n\nA chromatid is balanced, and thus yields a viable gamete, if $m$ is an even number ($0, 2, 4, \\ldots$). We calculate the probability that a chromatid is balanced, given $N=k$ crossovers.\n$$P(\\text{viable} | N=k) = \\sum_{m \\text{ is even}, m \\le k} P(M=m | N=k) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k \\sum_{m \\text{ is even}, m \\le k} \\binom{k}{m}$$\nWe utilize the binomial identity $\\sum_{m \\text{ is even}} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{k}{0} + \\binom{k}{2} + \\dots = 2^{k-1}$ for $k \\geq 1$.\nFor $k=0$, there are no crossovers, so all chromatids have $m=0$ exchanges. Since $0$ is an even number, all resulting chromatids are balanced and viable.
