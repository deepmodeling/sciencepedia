In each species, a single parent with allelic content $A A a a$ at the locus is crossed to a nulliplex tester $a a a a$. Assume the following fundamental conditions and definitions:\n\n- In an autotetraploid with tetrasomic inheritance, meiotic pairing is random among the $4$ homologous chromosomes, gametes carry $2$ alleles at the locus (because the gamete ploidy is $2x$), and there is no double reduction (no sister chromatids from the same homolog enter the same gamete), so that each gamete’s two alleles derive from two distinct homologs. All choices of two distinct homologs out of the $4$ are equally likely by Mendel’s law of segregation.\n\n- In an allotetraploid with disomic inheritance, there are $2$ fixed homologous pairs that segregate independently. The $A A a a$ allelic content is configured as $A/a$ on each homologous pair, so that each pair segregates as a diploid heterozygote, independently of the other. Each gamete receives exactly one allele from each homologous pair.\n\n- The tester $a a a a$ contributes gametes carrying $a a$ with probability $1$, so the zygotic $A$-allele dosage in the progeny equals the $A$-allele dosage transmitted in the gamete from the $A A a a$ parent.\n\n- The recessive phenotype requires zero $A$ alleles in the tetraploid zygote.\n\nStarting from these principles and definitions (random segregation, no double reduction in the autotetraploid, and independent disomic segregation in the allotetraploid), derive the gametic allele-dosage distributions in each species and use them to compute the probability of observing the recessive phenotype among progeny in each species.\n\nLet $P_{\\mathrm{auto}}$ be the probability of the recessive phenotype among progeny in the autotetraploid cross, and $P_{\\mathrm{allo}}$ the corresponding probability in the allotetraploid cross.

It describes a classic, standard comparison between tetrasomic and disomic inheritance in polyploids, which is a fundamental concept in genetics. The assumptions, such as random segregation and the absence of double reduction in the autotetraploid, are standard for an idealized model. All necessary information is provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is a straightforward application of combinatorial probability to Mendelian principles.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe task is to compute the ratio $r = P_{\\mathrm{auto}} / P_{\\mathrm{allo}}$. This requires deriving the probabilities $P_{\\mathrm{auto}}$ and $P_{\\mathrm{allo}}$. The recessive phenotype ($a a a a$) arises from the fusion of a gamete from the $A A a a$ parent and a gamete from the $a a a a$ tester. Since the tester exclusively produces $a a$ gametes, the progeny genotype is determined entirely by the gamete contributed by the $A A a a$ parent. A recessive zygote $a a a a$ can only be formed if the gamete from the $A A a a$ parent has the genotype $a a$. Therefore, $P_{\\mathrm{auto}}$ and $P_{\\mathrm{allo}}$ are the probabilities that the $A A a a$ parent produces an $a a$ gamete under autotetraploid and allotetraploid inheritance models, respectively.\n\nDerivation of $P_{\\mathrm{auto}}$:\nIn the autotetraploid, the parent genotype is $A A a a$. We can conceptualize the $4$ homologous chromosomes as carrying the alleles $A_1$, $A_2$, $a_1$, and $a_2$. According to the problem, gametes are formed by randomly selecting $2$ distinct homologous chromosomes. The total number of ways to choose $2$ chromosomes from $4$ is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{4}{2}$.\n$$\n\\text{Total combinations} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6\n$$\nThese $6$ combinations are stated to be equally likely. To find the probability of forming an $a a$ gamete, we must count the number of combinations that result in this genotype. An $a a$ gamete is formed only if we select the two chromosomes carrying the $a$ alleles (i.e., $a_1$ and $a_2$). There is only $1$ such combination.\nThe possible gametic genotypes and their frequencies are:\n1.  Choose the two $A$-carrying chromosomes ($A_1, A_2$): yields $1$ gamete of genotype $A A$.\n2.  Choose one $A$-carrying chromosome and one $a$-carrying chromosome: there are $2$ choices for the $A$ and $2$ for the $a$, so $2 \\times 2 = 4$ combinations. These yield $4$ gametes of genotype $A a$.\n3.  Choose the two $a$-carrying chromosomes ($a_1, a_2$): yields $1$ gamete of genotype $a a$.\n\nThe sum of combinations is $1+4+1=6$, which matches the total. The probability of forming an $a a$ gamete is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n$$\nP(\\text{gamete is } aa) = \\frac{1}{6}\n$$\nTherefore, the probability of obtaining a recessive progeny in the autotetraploid cross is:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{auto}} = \\frac{1}{6}\n$$\n\nDerivation of $P_{\\mathrm{allo}}$:\nIn the allotetraploid, the genotype $A A a a$ is structured as two independent homologous pairs, each being heterozygous $A/a$. Let us denote these pairs as Pair $1$ ($A/a$) and Pair $2$ ($A/a$). According to the rules of disomic inheritance, each pair segregates its alleles independently, following standard diploid Mendelian genetics.\nFor Pair $1$, the probability of contributing an $a$ allele to the gamete is $P(\\text{allele } a \\text{ from Pair 1}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nFor Pair $2$, the probability of contributing an $a$ allele to the gamete is $P(\\text{allele } a \\text{ from Pair 2}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nA gamete from this allotetraploid parent receives one allele from each pair. To form an $a a$ gamete, it must receive an $a$ allele from Pair $1$ AND an $a$ allele from Pair $2$. Since the segregation of the two pairs is independent, we multiply their probabilities:\n$$\nP(\\text{gamete is } aa) = P(\\text{allele } a \\text{ from Pair 1}) \\times P(\\text{allele } a \\text{ from Pair 2}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nTherefore, the probability of obtaining a recessive progeny in the allotetraploid cross is:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{allo}} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n\nComputation of the ratio $r$:\nThe final step is to compute the ratio $r = P_{\\mathrm{auto}} / P_{\\mathrm{allo}}$.\n$$\nr = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{auto}}}{P_{\\mathrm{allo}}} = \\frac{1/6}{1/4}\n$$\n$$\nr = \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{4}{1} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nThe requested ratio is $\\frac{2}{3}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}\n$$", "id": "2790613"}, {"introduction": "While the simple model of random chromosome segregation is a useful starting point for autopolyploids, their meiotic behavior can be more complex.

The concept of double reduction and its parameterization by $\\alpha$ are standard in quantitative and population genetics. The specified range for $\\alpha$ corresponds to theoretical limits under random chromatid segregation. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides a complete set of assumptions and a well-defined genotype, along with a clear objective to calculate gamete frequencies. The parameters are sufficient to determine a unique, stable solution.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is precise, formal, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\nThe problem statement is therefore deemed valid. It is a formal, self-contained problem in theoretical genetics. We proceed to the solution.\n\nLet the four homologous chromosomes of the $AAaa$ individual be labeled according to the allele they carry: $C_A^{(1)}$, $C_A^{(2)}$, $C_a^{(1)}$, and $C_a^{(2)}$. Gametes are diploid, meaning they receive two alleles. The formation of a gamete can be modeled as a stochastic process. The problem defines two mutually exclusive mechanisms for gamete formation: one that occurs with probability $\\alpha$ (double reduction) and one that occurs with probability $1-\\alpha$. We will analyze each case and combine them using the law of total probability.\n\nLet $f_k(\\alpha)$ be the frequency of gametes containing $k$ copies of the $A$ allele, where $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n\nCase 1: No double reduction (NDR)\nThis event occurs with probability $1-\\alpha$. In this mode, which corresponds to pure chromosome segregation, the two alleles in a gamete originate from two different homologous chromosomes. The formation of a gamete is equivalent to choosing $2$ distinct chromosomes from the set of $4$ homologs $\\{C_A^{(1)}, C_A^{(2)}, C_a^{(1)}, C_a^{(2)}\\}$. The total number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{4}{2}$.\n$$ \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6 $$\nSince homologous pairing is random and all gametes are equally viable, each of these $6$ combinations is equiprobable. We enumerate the resulting gamete genotypes:\n- To form an $AA$ gamete ($k=2$), both chosen chromosomes must carry the $A$ allele. This requires choosing the pair $\\{C_A^{(1)}, C_A^{(2)}\\}$. There is only $\\binom{2}{2}=1$ way for this to happen. The conditional probability of an $AA$ gamete, given NDR, is $P(AA | \\text{NDR}) = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n- To form an $Aa$ gamete ($k=1$), one chosen chromosome must carry $A$ and the other must carry $a$. This requires choosing one from $\\{C_A^{(1)}, C_A^{(2)}\\}$ and one from $\\{C_a^{(1)}, C_a^{(2)}\\}$. The number of ways is $\\binom{2}{1}\\binom{2}{1} = 2 \\times 2 = 4$. The conditional probability of an $Aa$ gamete, given NDR, is $P(Aa | \\text{NDR}) = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n- To form an $aa$ gamete ($k=0$), both chosen chromosomes must carry the $a$ allele. This requires choosing the pair $\\{C_a^{(1)}, C_a^{(2)}\\}$. There is only $\\binom{2}{2}=1$ way for this to happen. The conditional probability of an $aa$ gamete, given NDR, is $P(aa | \\text{NDR}) = \\frac{1}{6}$.\nThe sum of conditional probabilities is $\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{4}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = 1$, as required.\n\nCase 2: Double reduction (DR)\nThis event occurs with probability $\\alpha$. By definition, the two alleles in the gamete trace back to sister chromatids of a single homolog. This means the gamete's alleles are identical by descent from one of the four initial homologs. The process is equivalent to randomly selecting one of the $4$ homologs and duplicating its allele.\n- The parent has $2$ homologs with allele $A$ and $2$ homologs with allele $a$.\n- If a homolog carrying $A$ is selected (probability $\\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$), the resulting gamete is $AA$. Thus, the conditional probability $P(AA | \\text{DR}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- If a homolog carrying $a$ is selected (probability $\\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$), the resulting gamete is $aa$. Thus, the conditional probability $P(aa | \\text{DR}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- It is impossible to form a heterozygous $Aa$ gamete through this mechanism. Thus, $P(Aa | \\text{DR}) = 0$.\nThe sum of conditional probabilities is $\\frac{1}{2} + 0 + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$, as required.\n\nOverall Frequencies\nUsing the law of total probability, the overall frequency of each gamete type is the weighted average of the frequencies from the two cases:\n$f_k(\\alpha) = P(\\text{gamete } k | \\text{NDR}) \\cdot P(\\text{NDR}) + P(\\text{gamete } k | \\text{DR}) \\cdot P(\\text{DR})$\n\nFrequency of $AA$ gametes ($f_2(\\alpha)$):\n$$ f_2(\\alpha) = \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)(1-\\alpha) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\alpha = \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{\\alpha}{6} + \\frac{3\\alpha}{6} = \\frac{1+2\\alpha}{6} $$\n\nFrequency of $Aa$ gametes ($f_1(\\alpha)$):\n$$ f_1(\\alpha) = \\left(\\frac{4}{6}\\right)(1-\\alpha) + (0)\\alpha = \\frac{4-4\\alpha}{6} = \\frac{2(1-\\alpha)}{3} $$\n\nFrequency of $aa$ gametes ($f_0(\\alpha)$):\n$$ f_0(\\alpha) = \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)(1-\\alpha) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\alpha = \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{\\alpha}{6} + \\frac{3\\alpha}{6} = \\frac{1+2\\alpha}{6} $$\n\nThese are the general formulas as functions of $\\alpha$. To check, the sum of frequencies is:\n$f_0(\\alpha) + f_1(\\alpha) + f_2(\\alpha) = \\frac{1+2\\alpha}{6} + \\frac{4(1-\\alpha)}{6} + \\frac{1+2\\alpha}{6} = \\frac{1+2\\alpha+4-4\\alpha+1+2\\alpha}{6} = \\frac{6}{6} = 1$. The derivation is consistent.\n\nSpecial Case: $\\alpha=0$\nFor this case, we substitute $\\alpha=0$ into the general formulas.\n- $f_2(0) = \\frac{1+2(0)}{6} = \\frac{1}{6}$\n- $f_1(0) = \\frac{2(1-0)}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$\n- $f_0(0) = \\frac{1+2(0)}{6} = \\frac{1}{6}$\nThese results match the frequencies derived under the NDR case, as expected, since $\\alpha=0$ implies only NDR occurs.\n\nFinal Answer Assembly\nThe problem requires the answer as a $2 \\times 3$ matrix.\nThe first row corresponds to $\\alpha=0$, with frequencies for $0$, $1$, and $2$ copies of $A$: $(f_0(0), f_1(0), f_2(0))$.\n$$ \\left( \\frac{1}{6}, \\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{1}{6} \\right) $$\nThe second row corresponds to general $\\alpha$, with frequencies $(f_0(\\alpha), f_1(\\alpha), f_2(\\alpha))$.\n$$ \\left( \\frac{1+2\\alpha}{6}, \\frac{2(1-\\alpha)}{3}, \\frac{1+2\\alpha}{6} \\right) $$\nCombining these into the required matrix format yields the final answer.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{6} & \\frac{2}{3} & \\frac{1}{6} \\\\\n\\frac{1+2\\alpha}{6} & \\frac{2(1-\\alpha)}{3} & \\frac{1+2\\alpha}{6}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2790579"}, {"introduction": "A key skill for a geneticist is the ability to connect theoretical models to experimental data.

(Class $0$)\n    - $P(\\text{gamete } Aa) = 1$. (Class $1$)\n    - $P(\\text{gamete } AA) = 0$. (Class $2$)\n    The expected counts ($E$) for $N=600$:\n    - $E_0 = 0$\n    - $E_1 = 600$\n    - $E_2 = 0$\n\n**Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test**\nThe test statistic is calculated as $\\chi^2 = \\sum_{i} \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$. The degrees of freedom ($df$) for a test with $k$ categories is $df = k-1$. Here, $k=3$, so $df = 2$. The significance level is $\\alpha = 0.05$, for which the critical $\\chi^2$ value for $df=2$ is $5.991$.\n\n1.  **Test of Tetrasomic Model:**\n    $O = (97, 405, 98)$, $E = (100, 400, 100)$\n    $$ \\chi^2_{\\text{tetra}} = \\frac{(97 - 100)^2}{100} + \\frac{(405 - 400)^2}{400} + \\frac{(98 - 100)^2}{100} $$\n    $$ \\chi^2_{\\text{tetra}} = \\frac{(-3)^2}{100} + \\frac{5^2}{400} + \\frac{(-2)^2}{100} = \\frac{9}{100} + \\frac{25}{400} + \\frac{4}{100} $$\n    $$ \\chi^2_{\\text{tetra}} = 0.09 + 0.0625 + 0.04 = 0.1925 $$\n    Since $0.1925 < 5.991$, we do not reject this model. The fit is exceptionally good. The P-value is very high, $P(\\chi^2_{df=2} \\ge 0.1925) \\approx 0.91$.\n\n2.  **Test of Disomic Coupling Model:**\n    $O = (97, 405, 98)$, $E = (150, 300, 150)$\n    $$ \\chi^2_{\\text{dis,coup}} = \\frac{(97 - 150)^2}{150} + \\frac{(405 - 300)^2}{300} + \\frac{(98 - 150)^2}{150} $$\n    $$ \\chi^2_{\\text{dis,coup}} = \\frac{(-53)^2}{150} + \\frac{105^2}{300} + \\frac{(-52)^2}{150} = \\frac{2809}{150} + \\frac{11025}{300} + \\frac{2704}{150} $$\n    $$ \\chi^2_{\\text{dis,coup}} \\approx 18.727 + 36.75 + 18.027 = 73.504 $$\n    Since $73.504 \\gg 5.991$, this model is decisively rejected.\n\n3.  **Test of Disomic Repulsion Model:**\n    $O = (97, 405, 98)$, $E = (0, 600, 0)$\n    This model predicts zero individuals in Class $0$ and Class $2$. We observed $97$ and $98$ individuals in these classes, respectively. The model is falsified by direct observation. A chi-square test is not formally applicable due to the zero expected counts, but the conclusion is unambiguous: the model is rejected.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. A chi-square goodness-of-fit test on the three dosage classes strongly supports tetrasomic inheritance with random pairing and negligible double reduction: under the hypergeometric expectation for a duplex parent, the fit is excellent ($\\chi^2 \\approx 0.193$, $\\mathrm{df} = 2$, $P \\approx 0.91$), whereas both disomic configurations are decisively rejected; conclude tetrasomic (autopolyploid) inheritance.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with my derivations. The calculation of gamete frequencies for the tetrasomic model is indeed a case of sampling without replacement, described by the hypergeometric distribution. The calculated $\\chi^2$ value of $0.1925$ matches the provided $\\approx 0.193$. The corresponding P-value is very high, indicating an excellent fit. The analysis that both disomic models are rejected is also correct. The final conclusion is the logical outcome of the analysis.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. A presence/absence analysis is required and yields ambiguity: both tetrasomic and disomic coupling-phase models produce the same $3{:}1$ presence:absence ratio in a duplex $\\times$ nulliplex cross, so no conclusion can be drawn at $\\alpha = 0.05$.**\nThis statement proposes a less powerful analysis by grouping Class $1$ and Class $2$ as \"presence\". Let us check the ratios it claims.\n- Tetrasomic model: P(presence) = $P(1) + P(2) = 4/6 + 1/6 = 5/6$. P(absence) = $P(0) = 1/6$. Ratio is $5:1$.\n- Disomic coupling model: P(presence) = $P(1) + P(2) = 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4$. P(absence) = $P(0) = 1/4$. Ratio is $3:1$.\nThe premise that both models produce a $3:1$ ratio is factually incorrect. Furthermore, discarding dosage information from a dosage-sensitive assay is poor scientific practice.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The disomic coupling-phase model (both pairs heterozygous) provides the best fit to the three-class data ($\\chi^2 \\approx 73.5$, $\\mathrm{df} = 2$, $P < 10^{-15}$), so the locus follows disomic (allopolyploid) inheritance.**\nThe calculated value $\\chi^2 \\approx 73.5$ is correct for this model. However, a large $\\chi^2$ value (and correspondingly small P-value) indicates an extremely poor fit between the model and the data, leading to the model's rejection. The statement nonsensically claims this is the \"best fit\". The best fit is the tetrasomic model, which has a very small $\\chi^2$ value.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The data are most consistent with disomic repulsion-phase segregation (one pair $AA$, one pair $aa$), because the middle class is the largest. A chi-square test is unnecessary, as this configuration predicts all progeny in class $1$ only and thus explains the dominance of the class $1$ count.**\nThis model predicts that $100\\%$ of progeny must fall into Class $1$. The observation of $97$ and $98$ individuals in Class $0$ and Class $2$, respectively, constitutes a direct falsification of the model. It is the *least* consistent model with the data, not the \"most consistent\". The reasoning that it \"explains the dominance of the class 1 count\" is fallacious; while Class $1$ is dominant, this model's prediction is far too extreme and is contradicted by nearly $200$ data points.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2790598"}]}
