Hemizygosity for a locus (e.g., $b/\\mathrm{Df}(B)$) results in the expression of the phenotype corresponding to the single allele present (e.g., the $b$ phenotype).\n- Assumption $4$: All genotypes are viable.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the required criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on fundamental principles of transmission genetics, including chromosomal aberrations (deletions), Mendelian segregation, test crosses, and the concept of pseudodominance. These are standard topics in genetics. The scenario is scientifically realistic and sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a clear question and sufficient information to arrive at a logical and unique answer. The genotypes of the parents in the cross, the mechanism of inheritance (segregation without recombination), and the expression of alleles (dominance/recessivity/hemizygosity) are all specified. The explicit assumption of \"no recombination\" simplifies the problem into a discrete set of outcomes, which is a standard pedagogical approach. The notation for the heterozygote's genotype, $A^+\\,\\_\\;D^+/\\mathrm{Df}(B\\text{--}C)$, is non-standard but can be interpreted consistently. Given that the deficiency-bearing chromosome is $A^+ \\mathrm{Df}(B\\text{--}C) D^+$ and the intact chromosome is specified as having $B^+$ and $C^+$, the most direct interpretation of the notation is that the loci outside the deficiency are homozygous, resulting in the full genotype $\\frac{A^+ B^+ C^+ D^+}{A^+ \\mathrm{Df}(B\\text{--}C) D^+}$.

It is a well-structured and valid problem in genetics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe central concept to be demonstrated is pseudodominance. Pseudodominance is the expression of a recessive phenotype in a diploid organism that is heterozygous for a given recessive allele because the corresponding dominant allele on the homologous chromosome has been deleted.\n\nWe must first establish the precise genotypes of the parents and the gametes they produce.\n\n1.  **Parent 1: The Heterozygote**\n    - The problem states this individual is heterozygous for a deficiency spanning loci $B$ and $C$. One chromosome is intact, and the other has the deletion $\\mathrm{Df}(B\\text{--}C)$.\n    - The deletion-bearing chromosome carries alleles $A^+$ and $D^+$. Its structure is therefore $A^+ \\ \\mathrm{Df}(B\\text{--}C) \\ D^+$.\n    - The intact chromosome carries wild-type alleles at loci $B$ and $C$, which are $B^+$ and $C^+$. The consistent interpretation of the notation $A^+\\,\\_\\;D^+/\\mathrm{Df}(B\\text{--}C)$ in conjunction with the other statements implies that this individual is homozygous for the wild-type alleles at the non-deleted loci $A$ and $D$. Thus, the intact chromosome is $A^+ B^+ C^+ D^+$.\n    - The complete genotype of the heterozygote is $\\frac{A^+ B^+ C^+ D^+}{A^+ \\mathrm{Df}(B\\text{--}C) D^+}$.\n    - The phenotype of this parent is determined by its genotype. For locus $A$, it is $A^+/A^+$ (wild-type). For locus $B$, it is $B^+/\\mathrm{Df}(B)$ (wild-type, as $B^+$ is dominant). For locus $C$, it is $C^+/\\mathrm{Df}(C)$ (wild-type). For locus $D$, it is $D^+/D^+$ (wild-type). The parent is phenotypically wild-type for all four markers.\n    - Due to the \"no recombination\" assumption, this parent produces only two types of gametes, in equal proportions ($1:1$ ratio) according to Mendel's law of segregation:\n        - Gamete $1$: carrying the intact chromosome, $(A^+ B^+ C^+ D^+)$. Frequency = $1/2$.\n        - Gamete $2$: carrying the deficiency chromosome, $(A^+ \\mathrm{Df}(B\\text{--}C) D^+)$. Frequency = $1/2$.\n\n2.  **Parent 2: The Tester Strain**\n    - The genotype is homozygous recessive at all four loci: $\\frac{a b c d}{a b c d}$.\n    - This parent produces only one type of gamete: $(a b c d)$.\n\n3.  **Progeny Analysis**\n    We analyze the expected progeny from the cross by combining the gametes from each parent.\n\n    - **Progeny Class 1**: Formed by the union of gamete $1$ from the heterozygote and the tester gamete.\n        - Genotype: $\\frac{A^+ B^+ C^+ D^+}{a b c d}$. This is $A^+/a, B^+/b, C^+/c, D^+/d$.\n        - Phenotype: Since $A^+$, $B^+$, $C^+$, and $D^+$ are dominant over $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ respectively, the phenotype will be wild-type for all four loci. This phenotype is a result of standard dominant gene action.\n        - Expected proportion: $1/2$.\n\n    - **Progeny Class 2**: Formed by the union of gamete $2$ from the heterozygote and the tester gamete.\n        - Genotype: $\\frac{A^+ \\mathrm{Df}(B\\text{--}C) D^+}{a b c d}$.\n        - Phenotype analysis, locus by locus:\n            - Locus $A$: Genotype is $A^+/a$. Phenotype is wild-type ($A^+$).\n            - Locus $B$: Genotype is $b/\\mathrm{Df}(B)$. The individual is hemizygous for the $b$ allele. In the absence of the $B^+$ allele (due to the deletion), the recessive $b$ allele's phenotype is expressed. The phenotype is mutant ($b$). This is **pseudodominance**.\n            - Locus $C$: Genotype is $c/\\mathrm{Df}(C)$. Similarly, the individual is hemizygous for the $c$ allele. The phenotype is mutant ($c$). This is also **pseudodominance**.\n            - Locus $D$: Genotype is $D^+/d$. Phenotype is wild-type ($D^+$).\n        - The overall phenotype for this class of progeny is: wild-type at $A$, mutant at $B$, mutant at $C$, and wild-type at $D$.\n        - Expected proportion: $1/2$.\n\nThe question asks for the progeny phenotype that is *diagnostic* of pseudodominance for the genes within the deleted interval ($B$ and $C$). Progeny Class $1$ (all wild-type) shows normal Mendelian inheritance and provides no evidence of a deletion. Progeny Class $2$ exhibits mutant phenotypes for loci $B$ and $C$ precisely because the recessive alleles inherited from the tester parent are unmasked by the deletion inherited from the heterozygous parent. Therefore, the phenotype of Progeny Class $2$ is the diagnostic one.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n- **A. Progeny that are mutant at $B$ and $C$ but wild type at $A$ and $D$.**\n  This phenotype perfectly matches the derived phenotype for Progeny Class $2$: wild-type at $A$ ($A^+/a$), mutant at $B$ ($b/\\mathrm{Df}(B)$), mutant at $C$ ($c/\\mathrm{Df}(C)$), and wild-type at $D$ ($D^+/d$). This phenotype is a direct and unambiguous result of pseudodominance at loci $B$ and $C$ and is therefore diagnostic.\n  **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. Progeny that are mutant at $A$, $B$, and $C$ but wild type at $D$.**\n  For a progeny to be mutant at locus $A$, its genotype must be $a/a$ (or $a/\\mathrm{Df}(A)$). Since the tester provides an $a$ allele, the heterozygous parent would need to provide an $a$ allele or a deletion of $A$. The heterozygous parent has genotype $A^+/A^+$ and thus can only contribute an $A^+$ allele for this locus. Therefore, no progeny can have a mutant $A$ phenotype.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. Progeny that are mutant only at $D$.**\n  For a progeny to be mutant at locus $D$, its genotype must be $d/d$ (or $d/\\mathrm{Df}(D)$). The heterozygous parent is genotype $D^+/D^+$ and can only contribute a $D^+$ allele. No progeny can have a mutant $D$ phenotype. Furthermore, for the progeny to be wild-type at $A, B, C$ and mutant at $D$, it would require inheritance of an intact chromosome that is mutant only at D, which is not produced by the specified heterozygous parent.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. Progeny that are wild type for all four markers.**\n  This phenotype corresponds to Progeny Class $1$. While this class of progeny is expected to be produced, its phenotype is the result of standard dominance of the wild-type alleles from the intact chromosome over the recessive alleles from the tester. It gives no indication of the presence of the deletion or the occurrence of pseudodominance. It is not a *diagnostic* phenotype for pseudodominance.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2797706"}, {"introduction": "Once a deletion-associated phenotype is observed, the next logical step is to pinpoint the location of the affected genes.

The fundamental principle of this technique is that a recessive mutation fails to complement a chromosomal deletion if and only if the locus of the corresponding gene lies within the chromosomal segment removed by that deletion. The coordinates are given in megabases (Mb), increasing from the proximal to the distal end of the chromosome arm. We will determine the physical interval for each gene based on the provided complementation test results.\n\nLet $x_A$, $x_B$, and $x_C$ be the chromosomal coordinates in Mb for genes $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively.\n\nFirst, we analyze the data for mutation $m_C$ in gene $C$.\nThe mutation $m_C$ fails to complement the deletion $\\mathrm{Df}(1)$, which spans the interval $[1.0, 2.4]$ Mb. This implies that the locus of gene $C$ must be within this interval: $x_C \\in [1.0, 2.4]$.\nConversely, $m_C$ complements deletions $\\mathrm{Df}(2)$, $\\mathrm{Df}(3)$, $\\mathrm{Df}(4)$, and $\\mathrm{Df}(5)$. The complementation with $\\mathrm{Df}(2)$, which spans $[2.2, 3.9]$, is the most informative of these, as it constrains the upper bound of the location of $C$. Since $m_C$ complements $\\mathrm{Df}(2)$, its locus cannot be within the interval $[2.2, 3.9]$. This means $x_C \\notin [2.2, 3.9]$, which implies $x_C < 2.2$ Mb.\nCombining the conditions $x_C \\in [1.0, 2.4]$ and $x_C < 2.2$, we constrain the location of gene $C$ to the interval $x_C \\in [1.0, 2.2)$.\n\nNext, we analyze the data for mutation $m_A$ in gene $A$.\nThe mutation $m_A$ fails to complement two deletions, $\\mathrm{Df}(2)$ and $\\mathrm{Df}(3)$. This means the locus of gene $A$ must lie in the intersection of the intervals corresponding to these two deletions.\nThe interval for $\\mathrm{Df}(2)$ is $[2.2, 3.9]$. The interval for $\\mathrm{Df}(3)$ is $[3.3, 4.6]$.\nThe intersection of these two intervals is $[2.2, 3.9] \\cap [3.3, 4.6] = [3.3, 3.9]$.\nThus, the locus of gene $A$ is confined to the interval $x_A \\in [3.3, 3.9]$.\nThis result is consistent with the observation that $m_A$ complements $\\mathrm{Df}(1)$ ($[1.0, 2.4]$), $\\mathrm{Df}(4)$ ($[4.4, 5.6]$), and $\\mathrm{Df}(5)$ ($[5.4, 6.8]$), as the interval $[3.3, 3.9]$ is disjoint from all of these.\n\nFinally, we analyze the data for mutation $m_B$ in gene $B$.\nThe mutation $m_B$ fails to complement only $\\mathrm{Df}(4)$, which spans the interval $[4.4, 5.6]$. This places the locus of gene $B$ within this interval: $x_B \\in [4.4, 5.6]$.\nThe mutation $m_B$ complements the other four deletions. The most constraining of these are $\\mathrm{Df}(3)$ and $\\mathrm{Df}(5)$.\nComplementation with $\\mathrm{Df}(3)$ ($[3.3, 4.6]$) implies $x_B \\notin [3.3, 4.6]$, so $x_B > 4.6$.\nComplementation with $\\mathrm{Df}(5)$ ($[5.4, 6.8]$) implies $x_B \\notin [5.4, 6.8]$, so $x_B < 5.4$.\nCombining all constraints for gene $B$, we have $x_B \\in [4.4, 5.6]$, $x_B > 4.6$, and $x_B < 5.4$. The resulting interval for the locus of gene $B$ is $x_B \\in (4.6, 5.4)$.\n\nWe have now determined the localization intervals for all three genes:\n- Gene $C$: $x_C \\in [1.0, 2.2)$\n- Gene $A$: $x_A \\in [3.3, 3.9]$\n- Gene $B$: $x_B \\in (4.6, 5.4)$\n\nThe chromosomal coordinate increases from proximal to distal. By comparing the boundaries of these non-overlapping intervals, we can establish the gene order.\nThe supremum of the interval for $C$ is $\\sup(\\{x_C\\}) = 2.2$. The infimum for $A$ is $\\inf(\\{x_A\\}) = 3.3$. Since $2.2 < 3.3$, any possible location for gene $C$ is proximal to any possible location for gene $A$.

The derivation will proceed from first principles.\n\nLet $N_0$ represent the initial number of copies of a specific DNA template (amplicon) in a reaction. The problem states that the amplification efficiency is perfect, meaning each cycle of the polymerase chain reaction multiplies the quantity of the amplicon by a factor of exactly $2$. Therefore, after $C$ cycles, the number of copies, $N_C$, is given by the expression:\n$$ N_C = N_0 \\cdot 2^C $$\nThe cycle threshold, denoted $C_t$, is the cycle number at which the amount of amplified product reaches a pre-determined, fixed detection threshold, $N_{th}$. At this point, the following relation holds:\n$$ N_{th} = N_0 \\cdot 2^{C_t} $$\nThis fundamental equation can be rearranged to express the initial template quantity, $N_0$, as a function of the measured $C_t$:\n$$ N_0 = N_{th} \\cdot 2^{-C_t} $$\nThis relationship shows that the initial quantity of a target sequence is inversely proportional to $2^{C_t}$.\n\nThe experiment involves a test sample and a calibrator sample.
