By comparing the products generated by wild-type and a mutant enzyme, you can deduce the precise mechanistic step that has been impaired, honing your skills in connecting experimental outcomes to fundamental enzymatic processes like synthesis and translocation.", "problem": "An investigator is studying the function of human telomerase, the enzyme responsible for maintaining the ends of chromosomes. The human telomeric repeat sequence is $5'\\text{-TTAGGG-}3'$. The investigator performs an *in vitro* telomerase activity assay using a short, single-stranded DNA primer with the sequence $5'\\text{-(TTAGGG)}_2\\text{-}3'$, which is a 12-nucleotide primer.\n\nThe reaction mixture contains the primer, purified telomerase enzyme (either wild-type or a mutant form), and all four deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs). To visualize the products, the dGTP in the mixture is radioactively labeled ($[\\alpha\\text{-}^{32}\\text{P}]\\text{dGTP}$). After incubation for a fixed period, the reaction products are separated by size using denaturing Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE) and visualized by autoradiography.\n\nThe experiment with wild-type telomerase produces a characteristic ladder of radioactive bands on the gel. The lowest visible band corresponds to a product of 18 nucleotides, the next band is at 24 nucleotides, the next at 30 nucleotides, and so on, with the intensity of the bands gradually decreasing as the product length increases.\n\nThe investigator then repeats the experiment under identical conditions but uses a purified mutant form of telomerase, \"Mutant X\". The resulting autoradiograph for Mutant X shows a single, prominent radioactive band corresponding to a product size of 18 nucleotides. All other longer products (24-nt, 30-nt, etc.) are either absent or present at vanishingly low levels compared to the 18-nucleotide product. The unreacted 12-nucleotide primer is not visible as it does not incorporate any radioactive label.\n\nBased on these observations, which of the following molecular defects most likely explains the behavior of Mutant X?\n\nA. A mutation in the telomerase RNA component that changes the template sequence from $3'\\text{-AUC-}5'$ to $3'\\text{-AUU-}5'$.\n\nB. A mutation that significantly reduces the catalytic rate ($k_{\\text{cat}}$) of the reverse transcriptase activity but does not affect substrate binding or processivity.\n\nC. A mutation that severely impairs the ability of the enzyme to translocate along the DNA product after successfully synthesizing a single repeat.\n\nD. A mutation that completely prevents the initial binding of the DNA primer to the telomerase active site.\n\nE. A mutation that decreases the Michaelis constant ($K_M$) for the dNTP substrates, making nucleotide incorporation more efficient.", "solution": "- Telomerase extends chromosome ends by adding the hexamer repeat $5'\\text{-TTAGGG-}3'$ to the $3'$ end of DNA using its internal RNA template. After synthesizing one 6-nucleotide repeat, the enzyme must translocate (reposition the RNA template relative to the newly extended DNA $3'$ end) to add another repeat. The capacity to add multiple repeats without dissociating is termed repeat addition processivity.\n\n- In the assay, only incorporated guanosines are radiolabeled because the mixture contains $[\\alpha\\text{-}^{32}\\text{P}]\\text{dGTP}$. Each TTAGGG repeat contains three G residues, so each added repeat introduces label, enabling visualization of products that have undergone extension.\n\n- The primer is $5'\\text{-(TTAGGG)}_2\\text{-}3'$ with length $12$ nucleotides. After one repeat addition ($+6$ nt), the product length is $12+6=18$ nt; after two repeats, $24$ nt; after three, $30$ nt, etc. Wild-type telomerase yields a ladder at $18, 24, 30, \\ldots$ nt, indicating repeated cycles of synthesis and translocation (high repeat addition processivity).\n\n- Mutant X yields a single prominent band at $18$ nt with negligible $24$ nt, $30$ nt, etc. This pattern means the enzyme can bind the primer and catalyze synthesis of exactly one TTAGGG repeat (hence strong $18$-nt product with incorporated G), but fails to continue adding further repeats. The specific mechanistic step required after the first repeat is translocation/re-alignment of the product-primer with the RNA template; thus the defect is a severe impairment in translocation (loss of repeat addition processivity) after one repeat.\n\n- Evaluation of options:\n  - A: Altering the RNA template from $3'\\text{-AUC-}5'$ to $3'\\text{-AUU-}5'$ would change the sequence and the number of G incorporations per repeat, altering labeling and band spacing, not selectively abolishing products beyond the first repeat while preserving a strong $+6$-nt product. The observed strong $18$-nt G-labeled product is inconsistent with such a template change.\n  - B: A reduced $k_{\\text{cat}}$ with intact processivity would slow all additions uniformly; after fixed time, multiple ladder bands would still be present (albeit with overall reduced intensity), not exclusively the first $+6$-nt product.\n  - C: A defect in translocation after one repeat exactly explains a dominant $18$-nt band with absent/vanishing longer products.\n  - D: Preventing primer binding would abolish all products; the observed $18$-nt band contradicts this.\n  - E: Decreasing $K_{M}$ for dNTPs would increase catalytic efficiency, tending to enhance, not eliminate, longer products.\n\nTherefore, the most likely defect is severely impaired translocation after synthesizing a single repeat.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2341448"}, {"introduction": "The ability of telomerase to add multiple repeats in a single binding event, a property known as processivity, is critical for its biological function.

Assume each binding event yields at least one repeat before the first continuation decision is made, and that decisions are independent and identically distributed across repeats within a binding event.\n\nGiven $p=0.75$, compute:\n1) the expected number of repeats added per binding event, and\n2) the probability that at least $5$ repeats are added in a single binding event.\n\nExpress both answers in exact form (fractions or integers). Report your final answers in the order stated above.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It is therefore valid for analysis.\n\nLet $N$ be the random variable representing the total number of repeats added per binding event. The problem states that after each repeat is synthesized, the enzyme continues to add another repeat with probability $p$ or dissociates with probability $1-p$. It is also given that every binding event results in at least one repeat being added before the first such probabilistic decision is made.\n\nLet us define the sequence of events.\nThe first repeat is always added, so $N \\ge 1$.\nAfter the first repeat is complete, a decision is made. The enzyme dissociates with probability $1-p$. In this case, exactly one repeat is added. Thus, $P(N=1) = 1-p$.\nFor two repeats to be added, the enzyme must first continue after the first repeat (with probability $p$) and then dissociate after the second repeat (with probability $1-p$). Due to the independence of these decisions, $P(N=2) = p(1-p)$.\nGeneralizing, for exactly $k$ repeats to be added (where $k \\ge 1$), the enzyme must continue synthesis for the first $k-1$ steps and then dissociate after the $k$-th repeat is completed. The probability of this sequence of $k-1$ continuations followed by one dissociation is $p^{k-1}(1-p)$.\nSo, the probability mass function for $N$ is:\n$$ P(N=k) = p^{k-1}(1-p) \\quad \\text{for } k = 1, 2, 3, \\dots $$\nThis is the probability distribution for a geometric random variable with a \"success\" probability of $1-p$, where success is defined as dissociation, and the variable $N$ counts the trial number on which the first success occurs.\n\n1) Calculation of the expected number of repeats, $E[N]$.\nThe expected value of a random variable is defined as $E[N] = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k \\cdot P(N=k)$.\n$$ E[N] = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k \\cdot p^{k-1}(1-p) $$\nWe can factor out the constant term $(1-p)$:\n$$ E[N] = (1-p) \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k p^{k-1} $$\nThe sum is a known series related to the geometric series. Consider the geometric series $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} p^k = \\frac{1}{1-p}$ for $|p| < 1$. Differentiating with respect to $p$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dp} \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} p^k \\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k p^{k-1} = \\frac{d}{dp} \\left( \\frac{1}{1-p} \\right) = \\frac{1}{(1-p)^2} $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $E[N]$:\n$$ E[N] = (1-p) \\cdot \\frac{1}{(1-p)^2} = \\frac{1}{1-p} $$\nGiven the probability of continuation $p = 0.75$, the probability of dissociation is $1-p = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25$.\n$$ E[N] = \\frac{1}{0.25} = 4 $$\nThus, the expected number of repeats added per binding event is $4$.\n\n2) Calculation of the probability that at least $5$ repeats are added.\nWe need to compute $P(N \\ge 5)$. This event occurs if and only if the enzyme does not dissociate after the first, second, third, and fourth repeats. The process of adding at least $5$ repeats requires that the enzyme must \"continue\" after repeat $1$, \"continue\" after repeat $2$, \"continue\" after repeat $3$, and \"continue\" after repeat $4$.\nLet $C_i$ be the event that the enzyme continues after the $i$-th repeat. The probability of this is $P(C_i) = p$.\nThe event $\\{N \\ge 5\\}$ is equivalent to the intersection of the events $\\{C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4\\}$. Since the decisions are independent, the probability of the intersection is the product of their individual probabilities.\n$$ P(N \\ge 5) = P(C_1 \\cap C_2 \\cap C_3 \\cap C_4) = P(C_1) \\cdot P(C_2) \\cdot P(C_3) \\cdot P(C_4) = p \\cdot p \\cdot p \\cdot p = p^4 $$\nAlternatively, one could calculate this as $1 - P(N < 5) = 1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{4} P(N=k)$, which yields the same result:\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^{4} p^{k-1}(1-p) = (1-p)(1+p+p^2+p^3) = (1-p) \\frac{1-p^4}{1-p} = 1-p^4 $$\nTherefore, $P(N \\ge 5) = 1 - (1-p^4) = p^4$.\n\nGiven $p=0.75$, we express this as an exact fraction, $p = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n$$ P(N \\ge 5) = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^4 = \\frac{3^4}{4^4} = \\frac{81}{256} $$\nThe probability that at least $5$ repeats are added is $\\frac{81}{256}$.\nThe length of the repeat, $6$ nucleotides, is contextual information and is not required for the calculation of the number of repeats.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 4 & \\frac{81}{256} \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "2856985"}, {"introduction": "Telomere length in a cell population is not static but is dynamically regulated to a stable, homeostatic length.

The analysis proceeds from first principles as defined in the problem statement.\n\nLet $L$ be the length of a telomere in base pairs (bp). The expected net change in telomere length per cell division, which we denote as $\\langle \\Delta L \\rangle_L$, is the sum of the deterministic loss and the expected stochastic gain.\n\nThe deterministic loss due to the end-replication problem is given as a constant, $s$. This contribution to the change in length is $-s$.\n\nThe lengthening process is mediated by telomerase. The enzyme adds an average of $\\mu$ bp upon a successful engagement with the telomere end. The probability of this engagement, $p(L)$, is dependent on the telomere length $L$ and is given by the function:\n$$\np(L) = p_{0} \\exp(-\\alpha L)\n$$\nwhere $p_{0}$ is the maximum access probability at $L=0$ and $\\alpha$ is a parameter characterizing the occlusion effect.

First, isolate the term containing $L^*$:\n$$\n\\mu p_{0} \\exp(-\\alpha L^*) = s\n$$\nNext, divide by $\\mu p_{0}$ to isolate the exponential function. The parameters $\\mu$ and $p_{0}$ are given as positive, so this division is well-defined.\n$$\n\\exp(-\\alpha L^*) = \\frac{s}{\\mu p_{0}}\n$$\nTo solve for the exponent, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\exp(-\\alpha L^*)\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{s}{\\mu p_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the property that $\\ln(\\exp(x)) = x$, we get:\n$$\n-\\alpha L^* = \\ln\\left(\\frac{s}{\\mu p_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, we solve for $L^*$ by dividing by $-\\alpha$.

Since length must be a non-negative quantity, a physically meaningful steady-state length must satisfy $L^* > 0$. Given that $\\alpha > 0$, the term $1/\\alpha$ is positive. Therefore, the sign of $L^*$ is determined by the sign of the logarithmic term. The natural logarithm $\\ln(x)$ is positive if and only if its argument $x$ is greater than $1$.\nThus, for $L^* > 0$, we require:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mu p_{0}}{s} > 1\n$$\nThis inequality can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\mu p_{0} > s\n$$\nThis condition has a clear physical interpretation. The term $\\mu p_{0}$ represents the maximum possible expected telomere extension per division, which occurs when the telomere length approaches zero ($L \\to 0$, so $p(L) \\to p_{0}$). The parameter $s$ is the constant rate of shortening.
