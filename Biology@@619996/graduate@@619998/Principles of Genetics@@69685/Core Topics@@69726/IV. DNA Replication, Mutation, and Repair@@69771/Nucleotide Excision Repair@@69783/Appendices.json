This multi-protein machinery recognizes bulky, helix-distorting lesions and removes a short single-stranded segment containing the damage. The process involves two coordinated endonuclease incisions. For the context of this problem, we will model the key steps as follows: once a lesion is recognized, the XPF-ERCC1 nuclease complex makes an incision 21 nucleotides to the 5' side (upstream) of the damaged base, and the XPG nuclease makes an incision 6 nucleotides to the 3' side (downstream) of the damaged base. The resulting 28-nucleotide fragment is then excised.\n\nConsider a unique and unfortunate scenario within a stretch of DNA where two bulky adducts have formed close to one another on opposite strands. Let us define the position of nucleotides along the 'top' strand with an integer coordinate system, increasing from the 5' to the 3' end.\n- Lesion 1 (L1) is located on the top strand at position $N$.\n- Lesion 2 (L2) is located on the complementary 'bottom' strand at a position that pairs with nucleotide $N+10$ on the top strand.\n\nAssuming that the NER machinery recognizes both lesions and can initiate the incision steps at both sites concurrently, what is the most probable structural outcome for this DNA region?\n\nA. Both lesions are repaired sequentially without any complications, restoring the original DNA sequence.\n\nB. The repair machinery fails to unwind the DNA due to the proximity of the two lesions, and no repair occurs.\n\nC.

The concurrent incisions on opposite strands are staggered such that they create two single-strand gaps that are successfully filled in and ligated.\n\nE. The region targeted for excision on the top strand partially overlaps with the region targeted for excision on the bottom strand, resulting in the formation of a Double-Strand Break (DSB).", "solution": "Define the coordinate system on the top strand so that positions increase from its 5' end to its 3' end. By the NER model given, once a lesion is recognized on a particular strand:\n- The XPF-ERCC1 nuclease incises at the position $21$ nucleotides in the 5' direction relative to the lesion.\n- The XPG nuclease incises at the position $6$ nucleotides in the 3' direction relative to the lesion.\nThis removes a single-stranded fragment of length $28$ nucleotides, consistent with\n$$\n\\text{length} = (\\text{3' cut}) - (\\text{5' cut}) + 1 = 28.\n$$\n\nLesion 1 (L1) is on the top strand at position $N$.

Because the DNA strands are antiparallel, moving in the 5' direction on the bottom strand corresponds to increasing the top-strand coordinate, and moving in the 3' direction on the bottom strand corresponds to decreasing the top-strand coordinate. Thus, the bottom-strand incisions, mapped onto the top-strand coordinate, are\n$$\n\\text{bottom 5' cut (mapped)} = (N+10) + 21 = N + 31,\n$$\n$$\n\\text{bottom 3' cut (mapped)} = (N+10) - 6 = N + 4.\n$$\nHence, the bottom-strand excised interval (in top-strand coordinates) is\n$$\n[N+4,\\, N+31],\n$$\nwith length\n$$\n(N+31) - (N+4) + 1 = 28.\n$$\n\nNow compare the two excision intervals:\n$$\n\\text{top excision: } [N-21,\\, N+6], \\qquad \\text{bottom excision: } [N+4,\\, N+31].\n$$\nTheir overlap is given by\n$$\n[\\max(N-21,\\, N+4),\\, \\min(N+6,\\, N+31)] = [N+4,\\, N+6],\n$$\nwhich spans\n$$\n(N+6) - (N+4) + 1 = 3\n$$\nnucleotides.

A fascinating case of pathway crosstalk occurs when a single DNA lesion can be recognized by multiple repair systems. Consider a specific, complex lesion: an oxidized cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer, which we denote as CPD-O. This lesion presents features appropriate for two distinct repair pathways.\n\nFirst, its bulky, helix-distorting dimer structure can be recognized by the global genome pathway of Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER). The key initiating step is the binding of the XPC-RAD23B protein complex, which we will refer to simply as XPC.\n\nSecond, the oxidized component of the lesion can be recognized by a specialized DNA glycosylase, which we will call Oxidized Dimer Glycosylase (ODG), that initiates a Base Excision Repair (BER) like process.\n\nThe \"choice\" of repair pathway is determined by a kinetic competition. Once either XPC or ODG binds to the CPD-O lesion, it rapidly initiates a series of downstream events that commit the site to its respective pathway, effectively blocking the other protein from binding. This commitment step is much faster than the protein dissociation rate.\n\nAssume the following symbolic parameters within a cell's nucleus:\n- $[XPC]$: the concentration of available XPC complexes.\n- $[ODG]$: the concentration of available ODG enzymes.\n- $k_{on, XPC}$ and $k_{off, XPC}$: the association and dissociation rate constants for the binding of XPC to the CPD-O lesion.\n- $k_{on, ODG}$ and $k_{off, ODG}$: the association and dissociation rate constants for the binding of ODG to the CPD-O lesion.\n\nYou can assume that the total number of lesions is far smaller than the number of available repair proteins, so the concentrations $[XPC]$ and $[ODG]$ remain effectively constant.\n\nDerive a closed-form analytic expression for the probability, $P_{NER}$, that a single, newly formed CPD-O lesion will be processed by the NER pathway.", "solution": "We model the first-commitment decision as a race between two independent binding events to a single lesion. Because the proteins are in large excess, $[XPC]$ and $[ODG]$ are constant, so the hazard (association) rates are constant:\n$$\nr_{XPC} = k_{on, XPC}[XPC], \\quad r_{ODG} = k_{on, ODG}[ODG].\n$$\nThe time to XPC binding, $T_{XPC}$, is exponentially distributed with rate $r_{XPC}$, and the time to ODG binding, $T_{ODG}$, is exponentially distributed with rate $r_{ODG}$. The commitment step following binding is much faster than dissociation, so binding can be treated as effectively irreversible for pathway choice; consequently, $k_{off, XPC}$ and $k_{off, ODG}$ do not affect the outcome probability.\n\nThe lesion is processed by NER if and only if XPC binds before ODG, i.e., $T_{XPC} < T_{ODG}$.

A mutation occurs if a lesion forms, persists through repair processes, and is then converted into a mutation during replication. Based on the problem statement, these events are independent. Therefore, the mutation probability per base is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$\n\\mu = p_{\\mathrm{D}} \\cdot P(\\text{lesion persists}) \\cdot q\n$$\nwhere $p_{\\mathrm{D}}$ is the probability of lesion formation, $P(\\text{lesion persists})$ is the probability that a formed lesion is not repaired before replication, and $q$ is the probability that a persistent lesion is converted to a mutation. Our task reduces to calculating $P(\\text{lesion persists})$ for the transcribed (T) and non-transcribed (NT) strands in both proficient and deficient cells.\n\nLet us analyze the NER-proficient case first to determine $S_{\\text{proficient}}$.\n\nFor the non-transcribed strand, only Global Genomic NER (GG-NER) is active. The probability of repair by GG-NER is $p_{\\mathrm{GG}}$. Thus, the probability that a lesion persists is the probability that GG-NER fails:\n$$\nP(\\text{lesion persists})_{\\mathrm{NT, prof}} = 1 - p_{\\mathrm{GG}}\n$$\nThe mutation probability on the non-transcribed strand in proficient cells is therefore:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{NT, prof}} = p_{\\mathrm{D}} \\cdot q \\cdot (1 - p_{\\mathrm{GG}})\n$$\n\nFor the transcribed strand, a lesion is always subject to GG-NER. Additionally, if the lesion is transcription-blocking (with probability $b$), it is also subject to Transcription-Coupled NER (TC-NER). We apply the law of total probability to find the persistence probability.\nA lesion on the transcribed strand can be either transcription-blocking or not.\n- With probability $b$, the lesion is blocking. Both GG-NER (removal probability $p_{\\mathrm{GG}}$) and TC-NER (removal probability $p_{\\mathrm{TC}}$) can act.
