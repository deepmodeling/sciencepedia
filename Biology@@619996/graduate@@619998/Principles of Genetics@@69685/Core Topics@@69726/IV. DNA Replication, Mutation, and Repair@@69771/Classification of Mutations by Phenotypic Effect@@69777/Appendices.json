Under the standard genetic code, there are $64$ possible codons, of which $3$ are stop codons ($\\mathrm{UAA}$, $\\mathrm{UAG}$, $\\mathrm{UGA}$) and $61$ are sense codons that encode amino acids. A nonsense mutation is defined as a single-nucleotide change that converts a sense codon into a stop codon; a missense mutation converts a sense codon into a different sense codon; a silent (synonymous) mutation changes a codon without altering the encoded amino acid; a neutral mutation is one that does not change organismal fitness. Assume the following uniform random mutation model for coding sequence: \n- A codon is sampled uniformly at random from the $61$ sense codons.\n- One of the $3$ codon positions is chosen uniformly at random.\n- At that position, one of the $3$ alternative nucleotides (excluding the original) is chosen uniformly at random and substituted.\n\nUsing only the standard genetic code and the definitions above, compute from first principles the probability that such a single-nucleotide change produces a stop codon (a nonsense mutation).

A nonsense mutation is a single-nucleotide change that converts one of the 61 sense codons into one of the 3 stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA). We first calculate the total number of possible single-nucleotide mutations in the sample space, and then we enumerate the number of mutations that result in a stop codon.\n\nThe sample space, $\\Omega$, consists of all possible outcomes of the described three-step random process. Each outcome is an ordered triple: (initial sense codon, position of mutation, substituted nucleotide). The total number of such outcomes, $|\\Omega|$, is the product of the number of choices at each step.\n-   Number of initial sense codons: $N_{sense} = 61$.\n-   Number of positions in a codon: $N_{pos} = 3$.\n-   Number of alternative nucleotides for any given site: $N_{alt} = 3$.\n\nUnder the uniform model, all elementary outcomes are equiprobable.

Consider single-codon substitutions in the gene that change this catalytic lysine to arginine (Arg), glutamine (Gln), or glutamate (Glu). Assume assays are performed at $pH\\ 7.4$ and that the enzyme is essential for growth in the test condition, so that substantial losses in catalytic efficiency manifest as a deleterious phenotype.\n\nUse only fundamental definitions from the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology (DNA to RNA to protein), the standard genetic code, and basic physical organic chemistry of amino acid side chains (for example: Lys $\\varepsilon$-amino $pK_a \\sim 10.5$, Arg guanidinium $pK_a \\sim 12.5$ and resonance-stabilized cation, Gln amide is neutral and non-nucleophilic, Glu carboxylate $pK_a \\sim 4.1$ and negatively charged at $pH\\ 7.4$), together with definitions of mutation classes by their protein-level and phenotypic effects (missense, nonsense, silent/synonymous, neutral versus deleterious).\n\nWhich of the following statements are most consistent with these principles?\n\nA. All three substitutions (Lys→Arg, Lys→Gln, Lys→Glu) are missense and predicted deleterious for catalysis at this position; Lys→Arg is generally least damaging to $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ because it preserves a positive electrostatic environment but abolishes imine formation, whereas Lys→Gln and Lys→Glu abolish both nucleophilicity and the favorable positive charge, with Lys→Glu typically the most disruptive due to charge reversal.\n\nB.

The enzyme's mechanism requires the lysine's $\\varepsilon$-amino group for two functions: to act as a general base and to act as a nucleophile to form a Schiff base. For both roles, the amine must be in its unprotonated form ($-NH_2$). The enzyme's apparent $pK_a$ for this group is $\\approx 9$. At the assay $pH\\ 7.4$, the vast majority of the lysine side chains will be in the inactive, protonated ammonium form ($-NH_3^+$), but a small, catalytically essential fraction will be in the required reactive state. The positive charge of the protonated form may also play a structural or electrostatic role.\n\nNow, we evaluate the impact of each substitution:\n1.  **Lysine $\\to$ Arginine (Lys→Arg)**: Arginine's side chain is a guanidinium group ($pK_a \\sim 12.5$). At $pH\\ 7.4$, it is permanently protonated and positively charged. Its positive charge is delocalized by resonance, rendering it extremely non-nucleophilic. Therefore, it cannot form a Schiff base or act as a general base. This substitution preserves a positive charge but completely ablates the required catalytic functionalities. The mutation is deleterious. By definition, changing one amino acid to another is a missense mutation.\n\n2.  **Lysine $\\to$ Glutamine (Lys→Gln)**: Glutamine's side chain is a neutral amide. The amide group is not nucleophilic and cannot act as a general base. This substitution removes the catalytic functions and the native positive charge. The mutation is deleterious and is classified as missense.\n\n3.  **Lysine $\\to$ Glutamate (Lys→Glu)**: Glutamate's side chain is a carboxylic acid ($pK_a \\sim 4.1$). At $pH\\ 7.4$, it exists as a negatively charged carboxylate ($ -COO^-$). This represents a charge reversal from positive to negative at this position, which is highly disruptive. It cannot form a Schiff base. This mutation is deleterious and is classified as missense.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. All three substitutions (Lys→Arg, Lys→Gln, Lys→Glu) are missense and predicted deleterious for catalysis at this position; Lys→Arg is generally least damaging to $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ because it preserves a positive electrostatic environment but abolishes imine formation, whereas Lys→Gln and Lys→Glu abolish both nucleophilicity and the favorable positive charge, with Lys→Glu typically the most disruptive due to charge reversal.**\nThis statement is a comprehensive and accurate summary based on our analysis.\n-   All three substitutions change the amino acid, so they are **missense**.\n-   All three abolish the essential Schiff base mechanism, so they are **deleterious**.\n-   The chemical reasoning is sound: Arg preserves the positive charge but is non-nucleophilic. Gln and Glu remove the correct nucleophile and the positive charge. Glu introduces a repulsive negative charge (charge reversal), which is typically the most disruptive substitution. This statement is entirely consistent with the provided principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Lys→Arg is likely neutral because arginine can substitute for lysine in forming Schiff bases at $pH\\ 7.4$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The guanidinium group of arginine is not nucleophilic and cannot form a Schiff base. The substitution is deleterious, not neutral.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Lys→Gln is a silent mutation with no change at the protein level.**\nThis statement is incorrect by definition. A silent (synonymous) mutation does not change the amino acid sequence. A Lys→Gln substitution is a change in the amino acid sequence and is therefore a missense mutation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Lys→Glu could plausibly be neutral or advantageous at this catalytic position because it lowers the effective $pK_a$ and increases the fraction of the reactive unprotonated form, thereby preserving $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$.**\nThis statement's reasoning is flawed. While glutamate is deprotonated at $pH\\ 7.4$, its carboxylate group is the wrong functional group for the required mechanism. The enzyme requires a primary amine to form an imine, not a carboxylate. The mutation would be deleterious.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. By the definitions rooted in the Central Dogma and the genetic code, none of these substitutions can be nonsense; each represents a missense mutation rather than silent or nonsense.**\nThis statement is a correct application of fundamental genetic definitions. A **nonsense mutation** creates a stop codon; a **silent mutation** does not change the amino acid; and a **missense mutation** changes the amino acid. Since the substitutions result in Arg, Gln, or Glu, they are all missense mutations. This statement is precisely and factually correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nBoth statements A and E are correct and fully consistent with the provided principles.

Use the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology (deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to ribonucleic acid (RNA) to protein), the exon–intron structure of genes, and the mechanistic basis of nonsense-mediated messenger RNA (mRNA) decay (NMD) to reason about whether a given premature termination codon will (i) trigger NMD or (ii) escape NMD to produce a truncated protein. Then, reason from the locations of experimentally established functional domains and motifs to assess whether any truncated protein would plausibly retain function. The Exon Junction Complex (EJC) is deposited upstream of exon–exon junctions during splicing and is a key determinant of NMD: in mammalian systems, a premature termination codon located more than approximately $50$–$55$ nucleotides (nt) upstream of the last exon–exon junction typically elicits NMD, whereas premature termination codons in the last exon, or within approximately the last $50$ nt of the penultimate exon, generally escape NMD due to the absence of downstream EJCs.\n\nConsider the following four variant-in-gene contexts. For each gene, a single canonical protein-coding transcript is considered, with the stated exon structure and annotated functional features. All positions are given relative to the coding sequence of the canonical transcript.\n\n- Gene A: A cytosolic enzyme with a well-characterized catalytic domain spanning amino acids (aa) $45$–$310$ (encoded by exons $2$–$8$), and an allosteric regulatory helix spanning aa $340$–$370$ (exons $9$–$10$). The protein’s C-terminal tail, encoded by exon $12$, comprises aa $431$–$490$ and is compositionally biased and predicted to be intrinsically disordered with no conserved motifs across vertebrates. Multiple proteomic studies show isoforms lacking exon $12$ are expressed at approximately $15\\%$ of total protein in several tissues without apparent loss of enzymatic activity. Variant A is a nonsense change in exon $12$ introducing a stop codon $36$ codons ($108$ nt) upstream of the normal stop, truncating the last $36$ aa.\n\n- Gene B: A single-pass type I membrane receptor with a luminal ligand-binding domain (exons $1$–$13$) and a transmembrane helix encoded entirely within exon $15$ (aa $611$–$633$), followed by a short cytosolic tail (aa $634$–$650$) that recruits signaling adaptors via a tyrosine-based motif. Variant B is a nonsense change in exon $15$ introducing a stop codon at aa $605$, upstream of the transmembrane helix.\n\n- Gene C: A peroxisomal oxidoreductase whose C-terminus ends with a peroxisomal targeting signal $1$ (PTS1) tripeptide, Ser–Lys–Leu (SKL), encoded by the last $3$ codons of exon $10$. Variant C is a nonsense change in exon $10$ that removes the last $10$ aa including the PTS1 motif.\n\n- Gene D: A transcription factor with a DNA-binding domain (exons $3$–$5$) and a C-terminal transactivation domain (exons $7$–$9$). Loss-of-function of this gene is a known disease mechanism via haploinsufficiency. Variant D is a nonsense change in exon $8$, located $120$ nt upstream of the exon $8$–exon $9$ junction.\n\nWhich variant is most likely to be benign because the nonsense codon lies in the last exon, escapes NMD, and truncates a region without critical domains or motifs?\n\nA. Variant A in Gene A\n\nB. Variant B in Gene B\n\nC. Variant C in Gene C\n\nD. Variant D in Gene D", "solution": "The problem requires an evaluation of four genetic variants to identify the one most likely to be benign. The criteria for being benign in this context are explicitly stated: the nonsense codon must (i) be located in the last exon, (ii) consequently escape nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), and (iii) result in the truncation of a protein region that is not critical for its function. We will proceed by systematically analyzing each variant against these three criteria, based on the provided principles of molecular genetics.\n\nThe central principle for this analysis is the mechanism of NMD in mammalian systems. A premature termination codon (PTC) is generally recognized and triggers mRNA degradation if it is located more than approximately $50$–$55$ nucleotides (nt) upstream of the last exon–exon junction. This recognition is mediated by the Exon Junction Complex (EJC) that is deposited during splicing. Conversely, a PTC located in the final exon, or within the last $50$–$55$ nt of the penultimate exon, will typically not trigger NMD because there are no downstream EJCs to signal its premature nature. The resulting mRNA is stable and is translated into a truncated protein. The phenotypic effect then depends entirely on the functional importance of the truncated C-terminal portion of the protein.\n\nLet us evaluate each case.\n\n**A. Variant A in Gene A**\n\n1.  **Location of Nonsense Codon**: The variant is a nonsense change in exon $12$. Gene A is described as having its C-terminal tail encoded by exon $12$, which comprises amino acids (aa) $431$–$490$. This indicates that exon $12$ is the final exon of the considered transcript. This criterion is **satisfied**.\n\n2.  **NMD Escape**: Since the PTC is located in the final exon (exon $12$), there are no downstream exon–exon junctions and thus no downstream EJCs. According to the stated rule, the mRNA transcript carrying this variant will escape NMD. This criterion is **satisfied**.\n\n3.  **Functional Impact of Truncation**: A stable, truncated protein will be produced. The variant introduces a stop codon that truncates the last $36$ amino acids of the protein. This C-terminal region (aa $431$–$490$) is described as \"compositionally biased and predicted to be intrinsically disordered with no conserved motifs\". Furthermore, there is strong experimental evidence that \"isoforms lacking exon $12$ are expressed at approximately $15\\%$ of total protein in several tissues without apparent loss of enzymatic activity\". This directly implies that the entire C-terminal tail encoded by exon $12$ is dispensable for the protein's primary enzymatic function. Truncating a part of this tail is therefore highly unlikely to be deleterious. The critical catalytic domain (aa $45$–$310$) and allosteric regulatory helix (aa $340$–$370$) remain intact. This criterion is **satisfied**.\n\nConclusion for A: Variant A meets all three conditions for a benign outcome. It is predicted to escape NMD and produce a truncated protein lacking a non-essential C-terminal region. Therefore, this option is **Correct**.\n\n**B. Variant B in Gene B**\n\n1.  **Location of Nonsense Codon**: The variant is a nonsense change in exon $15$. This exon encodes the transmembrane helix (aa $611$–$633$) and the subsequent cytosolic tail (aa $634$–$650$), making it the final exon. This criterion is **satisfied**.\n\n2.  **NMD Escape**: The PTC is in the final exon, so the transcript will escape NMD. This criterion is **satisfied**.\n\n3.  **Functional Impact of Truncation**: A truncated protein will be produced. The PTC is at amino acid position $605$. This is upstream of the transmembrane helix (aa $611$–$633$). Gene B encodes a single-pass type I membrane receptor. The transmembrane helix is indispensable for anchoring the receptor in the cell membrane. A protein truncated before this domain cannot be inserted into the membrane and thus cannot function as a receptor. It loses both its correct localization and its entire signaling capacity, which relies on the transmembrane and cytosolic domains. The truncation removes a critical part of the protein. This criterion is **not satisfied**.\n\nConclusion for B: Although the variant escapes NMD, the resulting truncated protein is non-functional. The variant is pathogenic, not benign. Therefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Variant C in Gene C**\n\n1.  **Location of Nonsense Codon**: The variant is in exon $10$, which encodes the C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal $1$ (PTS1). This implies exon $10$ is the final exon. This criterion is **satisfied**.\n\n2.  **NMD Escape**: The PTC is in the final exon, thus the transcript will escape NMD. This criterion is **satisfied**.\n\n3.  **Functional Impact of Truncation**: A truncated protein will be produced. The variant removes the last $10$ amino acids, which critically includes the PTS1 motif (Ser–Lys–Leu). This motif is essential for the import of the protein into the peroxisome, its site of function. Without the PTS1, the translated oxidoreductase will remain in the cytosol and be non-functional, as it cannot reach its substrates within the peroxisome. The loss of a targeting signal leads to mislocalization and a complete loss of function. The truncated region contains a critical motif. This criterion is **not satisfied**.\n\nConclusion for C: The variant produces a non-functional, mislocalized protein. It is pathogenic, not benign. Therefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Variant D in Gene D**\n\n1.  **Location of Nonsense Codon**: The variant is a nonsense change in exon $8$. The gene's transactivation domain spans exons $7$–$9$, meaning the gene has at least $9$ exons. Therefore, exon $8$ is not the final exon. This criterion is **not satisfied**.\n\n2.  **NMD Escape**: The PTC is located in exon $8$, $120$ nt upstream of the exon $8$–exon $9$ junction. The rule states that a PTC more than $50$–$55$ nt upstream of the *last* exon-exon junction will trigger NMD. The exon $8$–exon $9$ junction is an upstream junction, but the distance of $120$ nt from the PTC to this junction is a strong signal for the NMD machinery. Since $120 > 55$, this PTC is predicted to robustly trigger NMD. The mRNA will be degraded, and little to no protein will be synthesized. This criterion is **not satisfied**.\n\n3.  **Functional Impact of Truncation**: Due to NMD, the primary consequence is a loss of protein expression from this allele. The problem states that loss-of-function of this gene causes disease via haploinsufficiency. A variant that triggers NMD is a classic loss-of-function allele and would therefore be pathogenic in this haploinsufficient context, not benign.\n\nConclusion for D: The variant does not meet the criteria. It is not in the last exon, it is predicted to trigger NMD, and the resulting loss-of-function is known to be pathogenic. Therefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**Summary**\n\nOnly Variant A in Gene A satisfies all three criteria outlined in the problem: the nonsense mutation is in the last exon, it escapes NMD, and it truncates a region of the protein for which there is strong evidence of being functionally dispensable. The other three variants are all predicted to be pathogenic due to loss-of-function, either by producing a critically truncated protein (B, C) or by triggering NMD in a haploinsufficient gene (D).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2799894"}]}
