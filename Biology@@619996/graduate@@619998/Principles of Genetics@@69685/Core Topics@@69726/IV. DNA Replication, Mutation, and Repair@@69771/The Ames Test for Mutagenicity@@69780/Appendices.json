This practice challenges you to act like a toxicologist, using data from strains sensitive to different types of DNA damage to deduce a chemical's specific mutagenic action. Mastering this comparative analysis is fundamental to moving beyond a simple \"mutagenic\" or \"non-mutagenic\" label to understanding the underlying molecular mechanism [@problem_id:1525590].", "problem": "A toxicology research group is evaluating the mutagenic potential of a newly synthesized chemical, designated \"Compound Z\". They conduct an Ames test, a standard procedure for identifying chemical mutagens. The test utilizes several auxotrophic strains of *Salmonella typhimurium*, which carry mutations in the histidine biosynthesis operon and are unable to grow on a medium lacking histidine. The test measures the frequency at which the compound induces reverse mutations (reversions), allowing the bacteria to grow into visible colonies on a histidine-lacking medium.\n\nThe researchers use the following well-characterized tester strains:\n- **Strain TA1535**: Carries a specific missense mutation (`hisG46`) that resulted from a T-to-C transition. It can be reverted to a functional state primarily by mutagens that cause base-pair substitutions.\n- **Strain TA100**: Derived from TA1535, it contains the same `hisG46` missense mutation but also carries the plasmid pKM101. This plasmid enhances an error-prone DNA repair system (the SOS system), making the strain significantly more sensitive to a wide variety of mutagens that induce base-pair substitutions.\n- **Strain TA98**: Carries a frameshift mutation (`hisD3052`), a deletion of a single G-C base pair in a repetitive sequence. This strain is used to detect mutagens that cause frameshift mutations (insertions or deletions of nucleotides).\n\nFor each strain, two sets of plates are prepared on a minimal glucose medium with a trace amount of histidine. One set contains the solvent used to dissolve Compound Z (Control), and the other set contains Compound Z. After a 48-hour incubation period, the number of visible revertant colonies on each plate is counted. The average results are as follows:\n\n- Strain TA1535 (Control): 21 revertant colonies\n- Strain TA1535 (with Compound Z): 98 revertant colonies\n- Strain TA100 (Control): 115 revertant colonies\n- Strain TA100 (with Compound Z): 792 revertant colonies\n- Strain TA98 (Control): 42 revertant colonies\n- Strain TA98 (with Compound Z): 45 revertant colonies\n\nA compound is generally considered mutagenic if it causes at least a two-fold increase in the number of revertant colonies compared to the control. Based on the provided data and the characteristics of the tester strains, which of the following statements most accurately describes the primary mutagenic action of Compound Z?\n\nA. It causes frameshift mutations, likely by intercalating into the DNA double helix.\n\nB. It is a potent mutagen that causes base-pair substitutions.\n\nC. It is not mutagenic in *Salmonella typhimurium* under these test conditions.\n\nD. It only induces mutations in strains containing the pKM101 plasmid and is otherwise non-mutagenic.\n\nE. It is a weak mutagen that causes both base-pair substitutions and frameshift mutations.", "solution": "The Ames test detects mutagenicity by measuring the fold-increase in revertant colonies on histidine-lacking medium when exposed to a test compound versus solvent control.

The larger response in TA100 is expected because pKM101 enhances an error-prone DNA repair pathway, increasing sensitivity to base-pair substitution mutagens.\n- TA98 does not show mutagenicity ($F2$), arguing against frameshift mutagenesis.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is inconsistent with the lack of increase in TA98.\n- B matches the strong increases in TA1535 and TA100 and the pKM101-enhanced sensitivity.\n- C is false because two strains clearly exceed the two-fold criterion.\n- D is false because TA1535 (without pKM101) shows mutagenicity.\n- E is false because there is no evidence for frameshift mutagenesis and the effect is strong, not weak.\n\nTherefore, the primary mutagenic action of Compound Z is potent base-pair substitution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1525590"}, {"introduction": "Interpreting experimental results requires careful observation and an understanding of dose-dependent effects. This scenario presents a classic pattern seen in the Ames test, where a chemical exhibits both toxicity and mutagenicity. Learning to distinguish between these effects by analyzing the spatial pattern of bacterial growth on a plate is a key skill for avoiding misinterpretation of toxicological data [@problem_id:1525592].", "problem": "A student in an undergraduate genetics course is conducting an Ames test to evaluate the mutagenic potential of a newly synthesized chemical, Compound X. The test utilizes a special strain of *Salmonella typhimurium* that is an auxotroph for the amino acid histidine (*his⁻*), meaning it cannot produce its own histidine and requires it in the growth medium. The bacteria are mixed with a rat liver extract (which contains enzymes that can metabolically activate certain chemicals into mutagens) and are plated on an agar medium that contains only a trace amount of histidine. This trace amount allows the bacteria to undergo a few cell divisions, forming a faint, uniform \"background lawn\" of growth, but is insufficient to permit the formation of visible colonies.\n\nA sterile paper disk saturated with Compound X is placed in the center of the plate. After a 48-hour incubation period, the student observes the result. They note a significant number of visible bacterial colonies appearing in a ring-like pattern some distance away from the central disk. However, in the immediate vicinity of the disk, there is a distinct, completely clear zone where no bacterial growth of any kind is visible, not even the faint background lawn.\n\nBased on this specific observation of the clear zone around the disk, which of the following is the most accurate conclusion about Compound X?\n\nA. Compound X is not mutagenic, as it clearly inhibits all bacterial growth near the disk.\n\nB. Compound X is an extremely potent mutagen, causing such rapid and widespread lethal mutations that no cells could survive to form colonies near the disk.\n\nC. At the high concentration near the disk, Compound X is cytotoxic (toxic to cells), while at lower concentrations further from the disk, it is mutagenic.\n\nD. Compound X chemically degrades the limited supply of histidine in the agar medium, preventing any bacterial growth in the vicinity of the disk.\n\nE. Compound X functions as an \"anti-mutagen,\" completely suppressing the spontaneous reversion mutations that would normally occur, thus creating a clear zone.", "solution": "1) Recall the Ames test principle: the tester strain is his⁻ and cannot form visible colonies without either an external histidine supply or a reversion mutation to his⁺. The plate contains only a trace amount of histidine, which allows a few initial cell divisions and produces a faint, uniform background lawn but is insufficient for sustained growth into colonies unless a reversion to his⁺ occurs.\n\n2) A compound that is mutagenic (often after metabolic activation by liver extract) increases the rate of his⁻ to his⁺ reversions. Where the compound’s concentration is appropriate to induce mutations without killing the cells, revertant his⁺ cells can proliferate into visible colonies. In a disk-diffusion setup, the compound forms a concentration gradient: highest near the disk, lower at increasing distance.\n\n3) Observation: a clear zone immediately surrounding the disk with no growth at all (not even the faint lawn) indicates that bacteria cannot carry out even the initial divisions permitted by the trace histidine. This implies cytotoxicity (bactericidal or strongly bacteriostatic) at high concentration. An anti-mutagen or suppression of reversions would not eliminate the background lawn, because the lawn depends on limited histidine, not on mutation rate.\n\n4) The ring of visible colonies farther from the disk indicates that at intermediate, lower concentrations the compound is not lethally toxic and instead increases the frequency of his⁺ revertants, consistent with mutagenic activity. This pattern—zone of inhibition near the disk and a ring of revertants beyond—classically indicates cytotoxicity at high concentration and mutagenicity at lower concentrations.\n\n5) Evaluate choices:\n- A is incorrect: the inhibition near the disk reflects cytotoxicity, not absence of mutagenicity; the ring of colonies demonstrates mutagenicity at lower concentrations.\n- B is incorrect: the absence of growth near the disk is best explained by nonspecific toxicity, not by “too potent” mutagenesis causing universal lethal mutations; lethal mutations would not selectively prevent the background lawn in this manner.\n- C is correct: high concentration near the disk is cytotoxic; at lower concentrations farther away, the compound is mutagenic, yielding revertant colonies.\n- D is unlikely: if Compound X simply degraded histidine locally, the background lawn would be absent near the disk but the formation of a distinct ring of revertant colonies specifically at a distance where mutagen concentration is lower is better explained by the cytotoxic-then-mutagenic gradient effect; moreover, histidine degradation does not account for enhanced revertant colony formation.\n- E is incorrect: an anti-mutagen would reduce revertant colonies but would not abolish the background lawn, which depends on trace histidine, not mutation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is that Compound X is cytotoxic at high concentration and mutagenic at lower concentration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1525592"}, {"introduction": "A qualitative assessment of mutagenicity is often followed by a quantitative one to determine a compound's potency. This exercise guides you through the process of fitting a dose-response model to Ames test data using the method of ordinary least squares.

For the base–pair substitution strain TA100, a low-dose regime is often well-approximated by a linear dose–response in which the expected number of revertants per plate increases linearly with the applied dose. Assume that for a chemical tested without exogenous metabolic activation, the dose–response in this low-dose region can be modeled by the linear relation $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x + \\varepsilon$, where $y$ is the number of revertants per plate, $x$ is the dose in $\\mu\\text{g/plate}$, $\\beta_{0}$ is the background revertant count, $\\beta_{1}$ is the slope (increase in revertants per $\\mu\\text{g}$), and $\\varepsilon$ are independent, mean-zero deviations.\n\nUsing ordinary least squares based on the principle of minimizing the sum of squared residuals, fit the linear model to the following observed mean counts (each value is the mean across replicate plates at that dose): doses $x \\in \\{0, 10, 25, 40\\}$ in $\\mu\\text{g/plate}$ with corresponding TA100 revertant counts $y \\in \\{20, 35, 52, 70\\}$.\n\nDerive the ordinary least squares estimator for the slope $\\beta_{1}$ from first principles and compute its value for this dataset.
