By tracing the effects of the alkylating agent ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) on a guanine base, you will see precisely how a chemical modification can alter base-pairing rules during replication to create a stable point mutation. This exercise [@problem_id:1474238] is fundamental to understanding how many carcinogens and laboratory mutagens function at the molecular level.", "problem": "A geneticist is studying a critical enzyme and wants to investigate the function of a specific amino acid, aspartic acid, at a particular position. The codon for this aspartic acid on the coding strand of the gene is $5'$-GAC-$3'$. The researcher decides to induce mutations using the chemical agent Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS). EMS is an alkylating agent known to primarily add an ethyl group to the O-6 position of guanine residues. This chemical modification alters the hydrogen-bonding properties of guanine, causing it to preferentially base-pair with thymine instead of its normal partner, cytosine, during DNA replication.\n\nAssume a single, successful alkylation event occurs on the guanine base of the specified $5'$-GAC-$3'$ codon on the coding strand. Following this event, the cell undergoes two complete and error-free rounds of DNA replication. What will be the final sequence of this specific codon on the coding strand in the resulting mutated DNA molecule? Express your answer as a three-letter sequence in the $5'$ to $3'$ direction.", "solution": "We begin with the original double-stranded DNA at the codon, where the coding (sense) strand is $5'$-GAC-$3'$ and the template (antisense) strand is $3'$-CTG-$5'$, consistent with Watson-Crick base pairing (G with C, A with T, C with G).\n\nEthyl methanesulfonate (EMS) alkylates the O-6 position of guanine on the coding strand, converting that guanine to an O-6-ethylguanine (denote it as G*). This modification alters pairing specificity so that, during replication, G* preferentially pairs with T instead of C.\n\nRound 1 of replication:\n- When the damaged coding strand $5'$-G*AC-$3'$ is used as template, the polymerase incorporates T opposite G*, and normal pairing for the remaining bases yields a newly synthesized complementary strand $3'$-TTG-$5'$.\n- When the undamaged template strand $3'$-CTG-$5'$ is used as template, normal pairing yields a newly synthesized coding strand $5'$-GAC-$3'$.\n\nThus, after the first round, one daughter duplex contains a T opposite the lesion (mismatch relative to the original), and the other daughter duplex remains unchanged at this site.\n\nRound 2 of replication:\n- Replicating the strand that contains T at this position ($3'$-TTG-$5'$ as template) produces a new strand with A opposite T, yielding a daughter strand $5'$-AAC-$3'$.\n- Replicating the damaged strand again continues to place T opposite G*, but in the complementary branch where the T-containing strand serves as template, the A:T pair becomes fixed. This is the canonical fixation of a GC to AT transition caused by EMS.\n\nThe final, stably inherited mutation after two error-free rounds is therefore a G:C to A:T transition at the first position of the codon on the coding strand, changing $5'$-GAC-$3'$ to $5'$-AAC-$3'$.\n\nHence, the final sequence of the codon on the coding strand in the mutated DNA molecule is AAC.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AAC}$$", "id": "1474238"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of base modification, we now examine the dynamic interplay between DNA damage and cellular repair. This problem [@problem_id:1474248] uses a hypothetical experimental scenario involving oxidative damage and the Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway in yeast. You will use provided mutation frequency data to quantify the efficiency of a repair system and predict the synergistic effect of combining a repair deficiency with mutagen exposure, a key concept in genetic toxicology.", "problem": "A geneticist is studying the effects of oxidative DNA damage in the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. The focus is on the lesion 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), which, if unrepaired before DNA replication, can pair with adenine, leading to a G:C to T:A transversion mutation after a subsequent round of replication. The primary defense against this lesion is the Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway, initiated by the DNA glycosylase OGG1.\n\nTwo yeast strains are used in a reversion assay. The first is a wild-type (WT) strain with a functional BER pathway. The second is an `ogg1Δ` mutant strain, which completely lacks the OGG1 enzyme and thus has a non-functional repair pathway for 8-oxoG. Both strains carry a `his3` mutation that can be reverted to the `HIS+` phenotype by a specific G:C to T:A transversion. The mutation frequency is measured as the number of `HIS+` revertant colonies per viable cell plated.\n\nThe experiment yields the following data:\n1.  The spontaneous mutation frequency in the WT strain is $2.0 \\times 10^{-8}$.\n2.  The spontaneous mutation frequency in the `ogg1Δ` strain is $2.0 \\times 10^{-7}$.\n3.  When the WT strain is treated with a specific concentration of an oxidizing agent that induces 8-oxoG lesions, the mutation frequency rises to $1.0 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n\nAssume that the mutation frequency is directly proportional to the number of 8-oxoG lesions that are not repaired before replication. The OGG1-mediated repair in the WT strain is not 100% efficient, meaning some fraction of lesions escape repair even in the WT. The oxidizing agent adds to the spontaneous rate of lesion formation.\n\nPredict the mutation frequency for the `ogg1Δ` mutant strain when it is treated with the same concentration of the oxidizing agent.

Focusing on UV-induced thymine dimers, this exercise [@problem_id:1474254] challenges you to predict the specific mutational outcome when a specialized, error-prone DNA polymerase bypasses the lesion. This illustrates the origin of \"mutational signatures,\" a powerful concept used to infer the underlying causes of mutations from genome sequencing data.", "problem": "A molecular genetics research group is investigating the consequences of Ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced DNA damage. They are working with two human fibroblast cell lines: a wild-type (WT) line and an experimental (EXP) line. The EXP line is genetically identical to the WT line except for a complete knockout of the *POLH* gene, which renders it deficient in DNA polymerase $\\eta$ (Pol $\\eta$). All other cellular processes, including other translesion synthesis (TLS) pathways, are fully functional in both cell lines.\n\nIn the experiment, cultures of both cell lines are synchronized in the S-phase of the cell cycle and then irradiated with a dose of UVC light sufficient to induce numerous thymine-thymine (T-T) cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), but minimal other forms of damage. Following irradiation, the cells are allowed to proceed through one full round of DNA replication.\n\nThe researchers have established the following biochemical facts:\n1.  In WT cells, Pol $\\eta$ is the primary polymerase that bypasses T-T CPDs. It does so with high fidelity, inserting two adenine (A) residues opposite the two thymine bases of the dimer.\n2.  In the EXP cell line, lacking Pol $\\eta$, the primary backup polymerase recruited to bypass a T-T CPD is DNA polymerase $\\iota$ (Pol $\\iota$).\n3.  Pol $\\iota$ exhibits a specific error-prone behavior when encountering a T-T CPD on the template strand: it correctly inserts an adenine (A) opposite the 5'-thymine of the dimer but has a very high probability of mis-inserting a guanine (G) opposite the 3'-thymine of the dimer.\n\nAfter the single round of replication post-irradiation, DNA is extracted from the EXP cells. Considering the molecular mechanism described, what is the predominant type of single-nucleotide substitution mutation expected to be found at the original T-T sites when the DNA from the EXP cell line is sequenced and compared to the original, undamaged reference sequence?\n\nA. T to A transversion\n\nB. T to G transversion\n\nC. T to C transition\n\nD. C to T transition\n\nE. A to G transition", "solution": "We model the lesion and bypass at a single T-T cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) on the template strand.\n\n1) Define the original undamaged duplex at the lesion site. Let the damaged template strand (Watson) initially contain adjacent thymines:\n$$\n\\text{Watson (parental template)}: \\dots T_{5'}\\,T_{3'} \\dots\n$$\nand the complementary strand (Crick) be:\n$$\n\\text{Crick (parental complement)}: \\dots A\\,A \\dots\n$$\nsince $T$ pairs with $A$.\n\n2) UV induces a CPD between the two adjacent $T$ bases on the Watson strand. During S phase, translesion synthesis proceeds across the CPD.\n\n3) In the wild type, polymerase $\\eta$ would insert correctly $A$ opposite both $T$ bases. In the EXP cells lacking polymerase $\\eta$, polymerase $\\iota$ is recruited. By the stated mechanism, when encountering the T-T CPD on the template strand, polymerase $\\iota$ inserts:\n- $A$ opposite the $5'$ thymine,\n- $G$ opposite the $3'$ thymine.\n\nThus, replication across the damaged Watson template yields a newly synthesized Crick daughter with:\n$$\n\\text{Crick (new)}: \\dots A\\,G \\dots\n$$\nopposite the parental Watson $\\dots T_{5'}\\,T_{3'} \\dots$. At the $3'$ position this creates a $T{:}G$ mismatch.\n\n4) The sister duplex formed by replication of the undamaged parental Crick strand ($\\dots A\\,A \\dots$) is copied normally to produce a new Watson daughter $\\dots T\\,T \\dots$; this duplex remains error-free at that site.\n\n5) To determine the mutation type relative to the original reference at the T-T site, track the fate of the $T{:}G$ mismatch at the $3'$ position upon subsequent copying. Semiconservative replication of the mismatched duplex produces two outcomes:\n- Using the strand carrying $G$ as template, DNA polymerase will insert $C$ opposite $G$, creating a $C{:}G$ pair at that position.\n- Using the strand carrying $T$ as template, DNA polymerase will insert $A$ opposite $T$, restoring a $T{:}A$ pair.\n\nTherefore, in the lineage templated by the misinserted $G$, the base at the original $T_{3'}$ site becomes $C$ on the strand corresponding to the original Watson orientation. This is a $T \\to C$ substitution at the $3'$ thymine of the original T-T site.\n\n6) Equivalently, note that the misinsertion changes the complementary base from $A$ to $G$ at that position; since complements are $A \\leftrightarrow T$ and $G \\leftrightarrow C$, an $A \\to G$ change on the complementary strand corresponds to a $T \\to C$ change on the original reference orientation. Given the stated high probability of $G$ misinsertion opposite the $3'$ thymine by polymerase $\\iota$, the predominant single-nucleotide substitution at original T-T sites is a $T \\to C$ transition.\n\nHence the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1474254"}]}
