The concepts of codons, reading frames, and the effects of in-frame versus frameshift mutations are fundamental to genetics. The provided genetic code information is correct. The problem is well-posed, providing a specific DNA sequence and a clear, answerable question. The language is objective and technical. The setup is self-contained and consistent. No scientific, logical, or factual flaws are detected in the problem statement itself.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe original DNA coding strand is $5'$–ATG GAA TTT CCG GAC TGA–$3'$.\nThe reading frame is established from the beginning, grouping the sequence into codons:\n- Codon 1: ATG (encodes Methionine)\n- Codon 2: GAA (encodes Glutamate)\n- Codon 3: TTT (encodes Phenylalanine)\n- Codon 4: CCG (encodes Proline)\n- Codon 5: GAC (encodes Aspartate)\n- Codon 6: TGA (Stop codon)\n\nThe polypeptide chain produced from this sequence is: Met-Glu-Phe-Pro-Asp.\n\nThe problem requires an example of a $3$-base deletion that removes an entire codon and preserves the downstream reading frame. Such a deletion, known as an in-frame deletion, must remove $3$ consecutive bases that constitute a single codon. This results in the removal of one amino acid from the polypeptide chain while the amino acids encoded downstream of the mutation remain unchanged.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Delete the three nucleotides TTT corresponding exactly to the phenylalanine codon (positions $7$–$9$ of the coding strand), producing $5'$–ATG GAA CCG GAC TGA–$3'$; classification: deletion; predicted protein change: loss of a single phenylalanine with all downstream amino acids unchanged.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option proposes deleting the codon TTT, which occupies positions $7$, $8$, and $9$.\n- Original sequence: $5'$–ATG GAA **TTT** CCG GAC TGA–$3'$\n- Proposed new sequence: $5'$–ATG GAA CCG GAC TGA–$3'$\n- The new codon sequence is:\n    - ATG (Met)\n    - GAA (Glu)\n    - CCG (Pro)\n    - GAC (Asp)\n    - TGA (Stop)\n- The new polypeptide is: Met-Glu-Pro-Asp.\n- **Comparison:** The Phenylalanine residue has been deleted. The downstream amino acids, Proline and Aspartate, are unaffected. The reading frame is preserved. The classification as a deletion and the predicted protein change are entirely correct. This is a canonical example of an in-frame deletion of a single codon.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B.

According to the principle stated in the problem, a deletion of a length that is not a multiple of $3$ will cause a frameshift.\n- Original sequence: $5'$–ATG GAA TTT CCG GAC TGA–$3'$\n- After deleting the T at position $9$: $5'$–ATG GAA TTC CGG ACT GA–$3'$\n- The new reading frame is:\n    - ATG (Met)\n    - GAA (Glu)\n    - TTC (Phe)\n    - CGG (Arg)\n    - ACT (Thr)\n    - GA...

The sequence given in the option, $5'$–ATG GAA T TGG ACT GA–$3'$, is not derivable from the specified operation.\n- **Error 2: Incorrect protein change prediction.** Let us analyze the consequence of the correctly derived sequence, $5'$–ATG GAA TCG GAC TGA–$3'$.\n    - The new codons are: ATG (Met), GAA (Glu), TCG (Serine), GAC (Asp), TGA (Stop).\n    - The resulting polypeptide would be Met-Glu-Ser-Asp.\n    - Compared to the original (Met-Glu-Phe-Pro-Asp), this mutation does not result in the \"removal of precisely one phenylalanine\". Instead, it is a complex mutation where Phenylalanine and Proline are replaced by a single Serine (as the deletion spans two codons). A more precise description is that Phe is mutated to Ser, Pro is deleted and the frame is maintained. The statement in the option \"removal of precisely one phenylalanine with downstream amino acids unchanged\" is a gross mischaracterization. In this specific case, the number of amino acids is reduced by one, but it is not due to a simple deletion of one amino acid.\n- **Conclusion:** This option is internally inconsistent and its description of the outcome is factually wrong.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D.

This option describes an **insertion**. Although the outcome described (in-frame insertion of an amino acid) is mechanistically related, the type of mutation is incorrect.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis, only option A correctly demonstrates, by both mechanism and example, a $3$-base deletion that removes an entire codon while preserving the downstream reading frame.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2799675"}, {"introduction": "While indels can dramatically alter a protein's reading frame, single-nucleotide substitutions are far more common and have a different spectrum of effects.

Normalization requires representing the change as a single, minimal, left-aligned event.\n- Reference: `ACGTAAAA GTA AAACCCG`\n- Alternate: `ACGTAAAA TAG AAACCCG`\n\nThe comparison shows that the change begins at position $9$. The reference segment `GTA` (from positions $9$ to $11$) is replaced by the alternate segment `TAG`. The variant can be described as a deletion of `GTA` and an insertion of `TAG` at this locus.\n\nThe variant alleles are:\n- Reference allele: `GTA`\n- Alternate allele: `TAG`\n\nThis representation is minimal because the alleles share no common prefix or suffix that could be trimmed. It is left-aligned because the change cannot be shifted further to the left (to a lower coordinate). Shifting would require that the base at position 8 (`A`) be identical to the last base of both alleles, which is not the case ($A \\neq G$). Thus, the change is correctly anchored at position $9$.\n\nThe normalized variant is a replacement of the reference bases `GTA` at positions $9-11` with the sequence `TAG`.\n\nFinally, we determine the molecular classification and the HGVS description.\n\n- **Molecular Classification**: The variant is a replacement of a $3$-nucleotide sequence by another $3$-nucleotide sequence. According to the problem definition, an equal-length deletion-insertion \"reduces to a multi-nucleotide substitution\". Therefore, the correct classification is **base substitution (multi-nucleotide substitution)**.\n\n- **HGVS Description**: The problem provides a specific rule for g. (genomic) nomenclature: `delins` must be used for replacements of more than one nucleotide. Since 3 nucleotides are replaced, `delins` is the correct term. The `>` operator is forbidden here.\n    - Reference Identifier: `REFGENE:EX1`\n    - Coordinates of the replaced segment: `9_11`\n    - Operation: `delins`\n    - Inserted sequence: `TAG`\n    - The complete HGVS description is `REFGENE:EX1:g.9_11delinsTAG`.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n- **A. Base substitution (multi-nucleotide substitution); REFGENE:EX1:g.9_11delinsTAG**\n    - The classification \"Base substitution (multi-nucleotide substitution)\" is correct based on the problem's definition for an equal-length replacement.\n    - The HGVS description `REFGENE:EX1:g.9_11delinsTAG` is correct based on our derivation and the provided HGVS rules.\n    - **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. Insertion; REFGENE:EX1:g.8_9insTA**\n    - The classification \"Insertion\" is incorrect. The net length change is zero, not an increase.\n    - The HGVS description represents only one of the three un-normalized primitive events and fails to describe the full, collapsed change.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. Deletion plus substitution (kept as separate events); REFGENE:EX1:g.[9_10delGT;11A>G]**\n    - This fails to follow the rule of collapsing adjacent events into a single representation. It also completely omits the insertion of `\"TA\"`, thereby describing a different final sequence.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. Deletion-insertion; REFGENE:EX1:g.9_11delinsTGA**\n    - While \"Deletion-insertion\" is a plausible classification, the HGVS description provides the incorrect inserted sequence (`TGA` instead of the derived `TAG`).\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **E. Base substitution; REFGENE:EX1:g.9_11GTA>TAG**\n    - The HGVS description uses the `>` operator. According to the problem's rules, this operator is strictly for single-nucleotide substitutions. This variant involves $3$ nucleotides, so using `>` is forbidden.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nOnly option A provides both the correct molecular classification and the correct HGVS description according to all the rules and definitions given in the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2799640"}]}
