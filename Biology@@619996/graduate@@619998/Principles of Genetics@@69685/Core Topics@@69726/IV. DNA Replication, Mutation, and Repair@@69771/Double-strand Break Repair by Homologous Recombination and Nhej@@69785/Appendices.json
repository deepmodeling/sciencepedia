BRCA2 also protects stalled replication forks. 53BP1 antagonizes DNA end resection and its loss promotes resection but does not substitute for RAD51 loading. In contrast, PARP inhibition is synthetically lethal with HR deficiency. Assume no compensatory overexpression of other mediators (for example, RAD52) unless explicitly stated.\n\nWhich option best predicts the combined outcome for RAD51 filament formation and cellular lethality in the BRCA2-ΔDBD (retaining some BRC repeats) cells relative to wild-type?\n\nA. Retained BRC repeats fully support RAD51 nucleation on ssDNA, so $k_{\\text{nuc}}/k_{\\text{off}}$ remains near wild-type; IR-induced RAD51 foci and HR are largely normal; cells are viable and resistant to PARP inhibition; 53BP1 status is irrelevant.\n\nB. Retained BRC repeats allow RAD51 recruitment to damage sites and initial nucleation, but absence of the DBD reduces productive engagement with ssDNA and increases filament dissociation, lowering $k_{\\text{nuc}}/k_{\\text{off}}$; RAD51 foci form but are unstable and poorly functional; HR is severely compromised with compensatory reliance on NHEJ; cells exhibit poor survival upon DSB-inducing stress and synthetic lethality with PARP inhibition; loss of 53BP1 does not rescue because RAD51 loading remains defective.\n\nC. Loss of the DBD abolishes only fork protection while leaving recombination intact; $k_{\\text{nuc}}/k_{\\text{off}}$ on ssDNA is unchanged; HR frequency is normal and NHEJ is reduced; cells are hyper-recombinogenic and display increased resistance to PARP inhibition.\n\nD.

It describes a standard experimental design in molecular biology used to dissect the domain functions of a key DNA repair protein. The provided principles are accurate reflections of established knowledge in the field of genome stability. The experimental readouts are appropriate for assessing the functions in question. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary information and constraints provided for a logical deduction. The terminology is precise and objective. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. The problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Derivation of the Solution**\nThe task is to predict the phenotype of cells expressing the BRCA2-ΔDBD mutant relative to the wild-type control. The analysis will proceed from the molecular mechanism to the cellular consequences, based strictly on the provided principles.\n\n1.  **Molecular Function of BRCA2-ΔDBD:** The wild-type BRCA2 protein performs two critical, coordinated actions for RAD51 filament assembly: (1) it binds RAD51 monomers via its BRC repeats, and (2) it targets this complex to the DNA substrate via its DBD, which engages the ssDNA-dsDNA junction. This allows BRCA2 to act as a mediator, displacing the high-affinity ssDNA-binding protein RPA and nucleating a stable RAD51 filament.\n\n    The BRCA2-ΔDBD mutant retains the BRC repeats (BRC1–BRC4), so it is capable of binding RAD51. However, it lacks the DBD. According to the principles, the DBD is essential for \"engagement of ssDNA\". Without this domain, the BRCA2-RAD51 complex loses its ability to anchor itself stably to the DNA substrate.\n\n2.  **Effect on RAD51 Filament Dynamics ($k_{\\text{nuc}}/k_{\\text{off}}$):** The formation of a stable RAD51 filament on RPA-coated ssDNA is a kinetically unfavorable process that requires a mediator.\n    - **Nucleation ($k_{\\text{nuc}}$):** While the BRC repeats can bring RAD51 into proximity with the DNA, the lack of a stable anchor (the DBD) means BRCA2-ΔDBD cannot efficiently displace RPA or effectively plant the initial RAD51 seed. Thus, the rate of productive nucleation, $k_{\\text{nuc}}$, will be severely reduced compared to wild-type.\n    - **Dissociation ($k_{\\text{off}}$):** Even if a nascent filament begins to form, its stability is compromised. The wild-type BRCA2 helps stabilize the filament. The BRCA2-ΔDBD mutant, lacking its DNA-binding anchor, cannot perform this stabilization function. Therefore, the RAD51 monomers will dissociate more readily, leading to an increased off-rate, $k_{\\text{off}}$.\n    - **Ratio:** The combined effect of a decreased $k_{\\text{nuc}}$ and an increased $k_{\\text{off}}$ is a dramatic reduction in the steady-state filament coverage, which is proportional to the ratio $k_{\\text{nuc}}/k_{\\text{off}}$.\n\n3.  **Cellular Phenotypes:**\n    - **RAD51 Foci:** IR-induced foci represent large accumulations of RAD51 at DSB sites. Since BRCA2-ΔDBD can still bind and transport RAD51, some protein may be recruited to damage sites, potentially forming visible foci. However, because the underlying nucleoprotein filaments are unstable, these foci will be transient and, most importantly, non-functional for recombination.\n    - **DSB Repair Pathway Choice:** The formation of a stable RAD51 filament is the prerequisite for initiating HR. Since this step is defective, HR will be severely compromised. Consequently, the cell will be forced to rely on the alternative, error-prone NHEJ pathway to repair DSBs.\n    - **Cell Survival and PARP Inhibitor Sensitivity:** A severe deficiency in HR renders cells highly sensitive to DSB-inducing agents like IR, leading to poor clonogenic survival. Furthermore, HR deficiency is known to be synthetically lethal with PARP inhibition. PARP inhibitors cause the accumulation of replication-associated DSBs that require HR for their repair. Cells with defective HR, such as those expressing BRCA2-ΔDBD, will be unable to repair these lesions and will undergo cell death. They will therefore be highly sensitive to PARP inhibitors.\n    - **Interaction with 53BP1 Loss:** The problem states that 53BP1 antagonizes DNA end resection. Its loss promotes resection. This can rescue HR defects that are caused by insufficient resection (e.g., in BRCA1 deficiency). However, the primary defect in the BRCA2-ΔDBD mutant is not resection but the subsequent loading and stabilization of RAD51 onto the resected ssDNA. The principles explicitly state that loss of 53BP1 \"does not substitute for RAD51 loading\". Therefore, promoting resection by deleting 53BP1 will not fix the core problem, and the HR defect and associated phenotypes will not be rescued.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation:** The BRCA2-ΔDBD mutant is profoundly defective in HR due to its inability to form stable RAD51 filaments. This leads to unstable RAD51 foci, reliance on NHEJ, sensitivity to IR, synthetic lethality with PARP inhibitors, and a phenotype that cannot be rescued by loss of 53BP1.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A.** `Retained BRC repeats fully support RAD51 nucleation on ssDNA, so $k_{\\text{nuc}}/k_{\\text{off}}$ remains near wild-type; IR-induced RAD51 foci and HR are largely normal; cells are viable and resistant to PARP inhibition; 53BP1 status is irrelevant.`\n- **Analysis:** This statement is incorrect. It negates the critical role of the DBD in engaging ssDNA for filament nucleation and stabilization, a role explicitly stated in the problem's principles. The BRC repeats are necessary but not sufficient for HR function.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B.** `Retained BRC repeats allow RAD51 recruitment to damage sites and initial nucleation, but absence of the DBD reduces productive engagement with ssDNA and increases filament dissociation, lowering $k_{\\text{nuc}}/k_{\\text{off}}$; RAD51 foci form but are unstable and poorly functional; HR is severely compromised with compensatory reliance on NHEJ; cells exhibit poor survival upon DSB-inducing stress and synthetic lethality with PARP inhibition; loss of 53BP1 does not rescue because RAD51 loading remains defective.`\n- **Analysis:** This statement accurately integrates all the provided principles. It correctly identifies the dual effect on filament kinetics (lowered $k_{\\text{nuc}}/k_{\\text{off}}$), the nature of the resulting RAD51 foci (present but non-functional), the shift in repair pathway choice (HR down, NHEJ up), the resulting cellular sensitivities (IR and PARP inhibitor), and the logical outcome of the 53BP1 genetic interaction. This aligns perfectly with the derivation.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C.** `Loss of the DBD abolishes only fork protection while leaving recombination intact; $k_{\\text{nuc}}/k_{\\text{off}}$ on ssDNA is unchanged; HR frequency is normal and NHEJ is reduced; cells are hyper-recombinogenic and display increased resistance to PARP inhibition.`\n- **Analysis:** This statement incorrectly compartmentalizes the function of the DBD. The provided principles link the DBD directly to RAD51 filament formation for HR, not just to fork protection. Claiming that $k_{\\text{nuc}}/k_{\\text{off}}$ is unchanged and HR is intact (or even enhanced) contradicts the stated mechanism.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D.** `Lack of the DBD removes an autoinhibitory module, making RAD51 filaments excessively stable on ssDNA (increased $k_{\\text{nuc}}/k_{\\text{off}}$); cells show elevated HR and improved survival after IR; 53BP1 loss further enhances survival.`\n- **Analysis:** This statement posits an autoinhibitory role for the DBD, which is contrary to the provided principle that the DBD is a positive effector that \"engages ssDNA\" to promote filament formation. The entire chain of reasoning that follows from this false premise is therefore incorrect.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E.** `Although HR is initially impaired, overexpression of human RAD52 commonly compensates for BRCA2 loss in mammalian cells, restoring $k_{\\text{nuc}}/k_{\\text{off}}$ and HR sufficiently to prevent PARP inhibitor sensitivity and lethality even without additional engineering.`\n- **Analysis:** This statement directly violates a direct and explicit instruction in the problem setup: \"Assume no compensatory overexpression of other mediators (for example, RAD52)\". The validity of the external claim about RAD52 is irrelevant; within the logical framework of the problem, this option must be dismissed.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2806829"}, {"introduction": "Moving from molecular mechanisms to quantitative measurement is a critical step in biological research.

Therefore, the term $\\frac{s_{\\mathrm{cNHEJ}}}{s_{\\mathrm{MMEJ}}}$ is a constant factor that cancels from the numerator and the denominator.
