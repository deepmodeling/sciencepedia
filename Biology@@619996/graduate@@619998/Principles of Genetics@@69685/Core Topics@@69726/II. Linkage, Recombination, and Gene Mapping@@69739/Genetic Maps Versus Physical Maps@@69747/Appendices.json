It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and complete. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core relationship between a physical map, measured in units of length such as megabases (Mb), and a genetic map, measured in centimorgans (cM), is defined by the local recombination rate density, which we denote as $r(x)$. This function, $r(x)$, quantifies the genetic distance per unit of physical distance at a specific physical location $x$ on a chromosome. Its units are typically centimorgans per megabase (cM/Mb).\n\nThe total genetic distance, $\\Delta G$, across a contiguous segment of a chromosome from a physical starting coordinate $x_a$ to an ending coordinate $x_b$ is obtained by integrating the local recombination rate density $r(x)$ over the physical interval $[x_a, x_b]$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\Delta G = \\int_{x_a}^{x_b} r(x) \\, dx $$\nThis integral represents the accumulation of genetic distance across the physical length of the chromosome segment.\n\nIn the problem presented, we are given a linear chromosome segment extending from the physical coordinate $x_1 = 0$ $\\mathrm{Mb}$ to $x_3 = 30$ $\\mathrm{Mb}$. The local recombination rate density, $r(x)$, is not uniform across this entire region but is provided as a piecewise constant function. The function is defined as follows:\n$$\nr(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\nr_1 = 0.5 \\, \\text{cM/Mb} & \\text{for } 0 \\le x < 20 \\, \\text{Mb} \\\\\nr_2 = 3 \\, \\text{cM/Mb} & \\text{for } 20 \\le x \\le 30 \\, \\text{Mb}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nTo compute the total genetic distance, $\\Delta G_{total}$, across the entire $30$ $\\mathrm{Mb}$ region, we must evaluate the integral of $r(x)$ from $x = 0$ to $x = 30$.\n$$ \\Delta G_{total} = \\int_{0}^{30} r(x) \\, dx $$\nDue to the piecewise nature of the function $r(x)$, we must partition the integral into segments corresponding to the intervals where the rate is constant. The point of discontinuity is at $x_2 = 20$ $\\mathrm{Mb}$. Therefore, we split the integral at this point:\n$$ \\Delta G_{total} = \\int_{0}^{20} r(x) \\, dx + \\int_{20}^{30} r(x) \\, dx $$\nNow, we substitute the respective constant values of the recombination rate density for each interval into the integrals:\n$$ \\Delta G_{total} = \\int_{0}^{20} 0.5 \\, dx + \\int_{20}^{30} 3 \\, dx $$\nThe integration of a constant is trivial. For the first interval, from $x=0$ to $x=20$ $\\mathrm{Mb}$, the genetic distance $\\Delta G_1$ is:\n$$ \\Delta G_1 = 0.5 \\times (20 - 0) = 0.5 \\times 20 = 10 \\, \\text{cM} $$\nFor the second interval, from $x=20$ to $x=30$ $\\mathrm{Mb}$, the genetic distance $\\Delta G_2$ is:\n$$ \\Delta G_2 = 3 \\times (30 - 20) = 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\, \\text{cM} $$\nThe total genetic distance across the entire $30$ $\\mathrm{Mb}$ region is the sum of the genetic distances of the two sub-regions:\n$$ \\Delta G_{total} = \\Delta G_1 + \\Delta G_2 = 10 + 30 $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{total} = 40 \\, \\text{cM} $$\nThe calculation is complete.

All necessary data are provided and are internally consistent.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by first calculating the total number of progeny from the experiment. Let $N_{NCO}$ be the count of noncrossover progeny, $N_{SCO, AB}$ be the count of single crossover progeny in the interval between loci $A$ and $B$, $N_{SCO, BC}$ be the count of single crossover progeny in the interval between loci $B$ and $C$, and $N_{DCO}$ be the count of double crossover progeny.
