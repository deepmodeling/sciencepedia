It is scientifically grounded in the principles of genetic mapping, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and framed using objective, unambiguous terminology. We may proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe problem states that the number of crossovers, which we denote as a random variable $K$, occurring between two gene loci on a single chromatid follows a Poisson distribution with mean $m$. The probability mass function for $K$ is therefore:\n$$P(K=k) = \\frac{\\exp(-m) m^k}{k!} \\quad \\text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$$\nwhere $m$ is the expected number of crossovers, defined as the genetic map distance in Morgans.\n\nThe recombination fraction, $r$, is defined as the probability that an odd number of crossovers occurs between the loci. We can express this as the sum of probabilities for all odd values of $k$:\n$$r = P(K \\text{ is odd}) = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} P(K=2j+1)$$\n$$r = P(K=1) + P(K=3) + P(K=5) + \\dots$$\nSubstituting the Poisson probability mass function into this sum gives:\n$$r = \\frac{\\exp(-m) m^1}{1!} + \\frac{\\exp(-m) m^3}{3!} + \\frac{\\exp(-m) m^5}{5!} + \\dots$$\nWe can factor out the $\\exp(-m)$ term:\n$$r = \\exp(-m) \\left( \\frac{m^1}{1!} + \\frac{m^3}{3!} + \\frac{m^5}{5!} + \\dots \\right)$$\nThe series in the parentheses is recognized from the Taylor series expansions of exponential functions around $0$:\n$$ \\exp(m) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{m^k}{k!} = 1 + \\frac{m}{1!} + \\frac{m^2}{2!} + \\frac{m^3}{3!} + \\dots $$\n$$ \\exp(-m) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-m)^k}{k!} = 1 - \\frac{m}{1!} + \\frac{m^2}{2!} - \\frac{m^3}{3!} + \\dots $$\nTo isolate the sum of the odd-powered terms, we subtract the second series from the first:\n$$ \\exp(m) - \\exp(-m) = \\left(1 + \\frac{m}{1!} + \\dots\\right) - \\left(1 - \\frac{m}{1!} + \\dots\\right) = 2 \\left( \\frac{m}{1!} + \\frac{m^3}{3!} + \\frac{m^5}{5!} + \\dots \\right) $$\nThe expression in the parentheses is exactly the series we need for the calculation of $r$. Therefore:\n$$ \\frac{m^1}{1!} + \\frac{m^3}{3!} + \\frac{m^5}{5!} + \\dots = \\frac{1}{2} (\\exp(m) - \\exp(-m)) $$\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $r$:\n$$r = \\exp(-m) \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (\\exp(m) - \\exp(-m)) \\right]$$\n$$r = \\frac{1}{2} (\\exp(-m)\\exp(m) - \\exp(-m)\\exp(-m))$$\n$$r = \\frac{1}{2} (1 - \\exp(-2m))$$\nThis is the required relationship between $r$ and $m$, known as the Haldane mapping function. This completes the first part of the task.\n\nNext, we must compute the value of $m$ for a given recombination fraction $r = 0.2$. We rearrange the derived equation to solve for $m$:\n$$0.2 = \\frac{1}{2} (1 - \\exp(-2m))$$\n$$0.4 = 1 - \\exp(-2m)$$\n$$\\exp(-2m) = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-2m = \\ln(0.6)$$\n$$m = -\\frac{1}{2} \\ln(0.6)$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value and round to $4$ significant figures, as instructed.\n$$m \\approx -\\frac{1}{2} (-0.5108256)$$\n$$m \\approx 0.2554128$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we get $m = 0.2554$ Morgans.\n\nFinally, we address the practical implication. The observable quantity in genetic experiments is the recombination fraction $r$, while the map distance $m$ is a theoretical construct representing the true average number of crossover events. For very small distances, where $m \\ll 1$, the Taylor expansion of the mapping function, $\\exp(-2m) \\approx 1 - 2m + \\frac{(2m)^2}{2} - \\dots$, gives $r \\approx \\frac{1}{2}(1 - (1 - 2m)) = m$. In this regime, $r$ is a good approximation of $m$.\n\nHowever, as the distance $m$ increases, the probability of multiple crossovers between the loci becomes significant. An even number of crossovers (e.g., a double crossover) restores the parental linkage of alleles on the chromatid, so it does not produce a recombinant chromosome and is not detected in the measurement of $r$. The recombination fraction $r$ only counts the net result of an odd number of events. Consequently, $r$ systematically underestimates the true frequency of crossover events, $m$. As shown by our calculation, an observed recombination of $r=0.2$ corresponds to an actual map distance of $m \\approx 0.2554$ Morgans. The inferred map length is thus \"inflated\" relative to the observed recombination frequency to account for the unobserved, even-numbered crossover events. This effect becomes more pronounced as distance increases, with $r$ asymptotically approaching a maximum of $0.5$ (for unlinked genes) while $m$ can increase without bound.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2554}$$", "id": "2826723"}, {"introduction": "While the Haldane model provides a crucial baseline, real biological systems often exhibit crossover interference, where one crossover event influences the probability of another nearby.

The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for its resolution. I will proceed with the derivation as requested.\n\nThe map distance, $m$, is defined as the expected number of crossovers occurring on a single chromatid in the interval between two genetic loci. The recombination fraction, $r$, is the probability that a gamete produced by a heterozygous individual will be recombinant for these loci. A gamete is recombinant if and only if an odd number of crossovers have occurred between the loci on the chromatid it inherits.\n\n**1) Haldane's Mapping Function (No Interference)**\n\nIn this model, crossovers are assumed to occur as a homogeneous Poisson process along the chromosome. The parameter of the Poisson process is the expected number of events in the interval, which is the map distance $m$. The probability of observing exactly $k$ crossovers in the interval is given by the Poisson probability mass function:\n$$P(k; m) = \\frac{m^k \\exp(-m)}{k!}$$\nfor $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n\nRecombination is observed if the number of crossovers $k$ is odd. The recombination fraction $r$ is therefore the sum of probabilities for all odd values of $k$:\n$$r = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} P(k=2j+1; m) = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{m^{2j+1} \\exp(-m)}{(2j+1)!}$$\nWe can factor out the term $\\exp(-m)$:\n$$r = \\exp(-m) \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{m^{2j+1}}{(2j+1)!}$$\nThe summation term is the Taylor series expansion for the hyperbolic sine function, $\\sinh(m)$.\n$$\\sinh(m) = \\frac{\\exp(m) - \\exp(-m)}{2} = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{m^{2j+1}}{(2j+1)!}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $r$:\n$$r = \\exp(-m) \\sinh(m) = \\exp(-m) \\left( \\frac{\\exp(m) - \\exp(-m)}{2} \\right)$$\n$$r = \\frac{\\exp(-m)\\exp(m) - \\exp(-m)\\exp(-m)}{2} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-2m)}{2}$$\nThis equation gives the recombination fraction $r$ as a function of map distance $m$. To solve for $m$ in terms of $r$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$2r = 1 - \\exp(-2m)$$\n$$\\exp(-2m) = 1 - 2r$$\n$$-2m = \\ln(1 - 2r)$$\n$$m_{\\text{Haldane}}(r) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\ln(1 - 2r)$$\nThis is Haldane's mapping function. For the given recombination fraction $r = 0.2$, the map distance in Morgans is:\n$$m_{\\text{Haldane}} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\ln(1 - 2(0.2)) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\ln(1 - 0.4) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\ln(0.6)$$\nNumerically, $\\ln(0.6) \\approx -0.5108256$.\n$$m_{\\text{Haldane}} \\approx -\\frac{1}{2}(-0.5108256) \\approx 0.2554128 \\text{ Morgans}$$\nSince $1$ Morgan is $100$ centiMorgans (cM), we have:\n$$m_{\\text{Haldane}} \\approx 25.54128 \\text{ cM}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $25.54$ cM.\n\n**2) Kosambi's Mapping Function (Positive Interference)**\n\nThis model incorporates positive interference, where a crossover event reduces the probability of another crossover nearby. The problem directs us to derive a first-order differential equation. Let us consider the change in recombination fraction, $\\mathrm{d}r$, as the map distance $m$ is increased by an infinitesimal amount $\\mathrm{d}m$. The probability of a crossover in the segment $\\mathrm{d}m$ is, by definition, $\\mathrm{d}m$.\nThis new crossover flips the parity of the total number of crossovers in the interval.\nThe recombination fraction increases if a previously non-recombinant chromatid (even number of crossovers, probability $1-r$) becomes recombinant. It decreases if a previously recombinant chromatid (odd number of crossovers, probability $r$) becomes non-recombinant.\n\nThe rate of change is $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}r}{\\mathrm{d}m}$. In the absence of interference, the rate of conversion from even to odd is $1-r$ and the rate of conversion from odd to even is $r$, leading to $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}r}{\\mathrm{d}m} = (1-r) - r = 1-2r$, which upon integration yields the Haldane function.\n\nWith interference, the rate of adding a new crossover depends on whether crossovers are already present. Kosambi's model is based on the postulate that the local coefficient of coincidence (COC) is equal to $2r$. The COC is the ratio of the conditional probability of a crossover given one is already present, to the unconditional probability.\nThis leads to the differential equation relating $r$ and $m$:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}r}{\\mathrm{d}m} = 1 - 4r^2$$\nWe solve this separable differential equation:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}r}{1 - 4r^2} = \\mathrm{d}m$$\nIntegrating both sides, with the boundary condition that $r=0$ when $m=0$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{r} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{1 - 4x^2} = \\int_{0}^{m} \\mathrm{d}y$$\nThe integral on the left is a standard form. Let $u = 2x$, so $\\mathrm{d}u = 2\\mathrm{d}x$.\n$$\\int_{0}^{2r} \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{1-u^2} = m$$\nThe integral of $\\frac{1}{1-u^2}$ is $\\operatorname{arctanh}(u)$.\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\operatorname{arctanh}(u) \\right]_0^{2r} = m$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2} (\\operatorname{arctanh}(2r) - \\operatorname{arctanh}(0)) = m$$\nSince $\\operatorname{arctanh}(0) = 0$, we have:\n$$m_{\\text{Kosambi}}(r) = \\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{arctanh}(2r)$$\nThis is Kosambi's mapping function. The inverse hyperbolic tangent can also be expressed using the natural logarithm: $\\operatorname{arctanh}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1+x}{1-x}\\right)$.\nThus, an equivalent form is $m_{\\text{Kosambi}}(r) = \\frac{1}{4}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1+2r}{1-2r}\\right)$.\n\nFor the given recombination fraction $r = 0.2$, the map distance in Morgans is:\n$$m_{\\text{Kosambi}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{arctanh}(2(0.2)) = \\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{arctanh}(0.4)$$\nNumerically, $\\operatorname{arctanh}(0.4) \\approx 0.4236489$.\n$$m_{\\text{Kosambi}} \\approx \\frac{1}{2}(0.4236489) \\approx 0.2118245 \\text{ Morgans}$$\nConverting to centiMorgans:\n$$m_{\\text{Kosambi}} \\approx 21.18245 \\text{ cM}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $21.18$ cM.\n\n**3) Interpretation of the Comparison**\n\nWe found that for a recombination fraction of $r=0.2$, the inferred map distances are $m_{\\text{Haldane}} \\approx 25.54$ cM and $m_{\\text{Kosambi}} \\approx 21.18$ cM. The Kosambi model, which accounts for positive interference, yields a smaller map distance for the same observed recombination frequency.\n\nThis result is a direct consequence of the differing assumptions about multiple crossovers.\n- **Map distance ($m$)** is the total expected frequency of crossovers.\n- **Recombination fraction ($r$)** is the frequency of observing an odd number of crossovers.\n\nEven numbers of crossovers ($k=2, 4, \\dots$) consume map distance but are not detected as recombination events; they \"mask\" each other.\n- In the **Haldane model (no interference)**, crossovers are independent events. The probability of having two or more crossovers is significant. These multiple crossovers, particularly those of even number, increase the total number of crossover events ($m$) required to achieve a given frequency of odd-numbered events ($r$).\n- In the **Kosambi model (positive interference)**, the presence of one crossover suppresses the formation of others nearby. This systematically reduces the frequency of double, triple, and higher-order crossover events compared to the Haldane model. By reducing the occurrence of \"masking\" double crossovers, interference makes recombination a more \"efficient\" indicator of the underlying crossover frequency. Consequently, a smaller total number of crossovers (a smaller $m$) is needed to produce the same observed recombination fraction $r$.\n\nIn conclusion, for a given $r$, the inferred map distance $m$ must be larger in the no-interference model to account for the higher expected number of \"wasted\" or \"hidden\" crossovers in even-numbered configurations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 21.18 & 25.54 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2826683"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical models are powerful, but their practical application requires knowing their limits.
