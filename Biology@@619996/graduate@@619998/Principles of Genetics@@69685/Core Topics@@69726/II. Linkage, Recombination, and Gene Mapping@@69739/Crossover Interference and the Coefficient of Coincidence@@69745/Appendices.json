There are no internal contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and unambiguously formulated. A solution will be derived from first principles as requested.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nLet $E_{AB}$ be the event that a randomly selected gamete from the heterozygote parent is recombinant for the interval between loci $A$ and $B$. Let $E_{BC}$ be the event that the same gamete is recombinant for the interval between loci $B$ and $C$.\n\nAccording to the problem's definition, the recombination fraction is the probability of a recombination event in a given interval. Therefore, the probabilities of these events are given by the single-interval recombination fractions:\n$$P(E_{AB}) = r_{AB}$$\n$$P(E_{BC}) = r_{BC}$$\n\nA double crossover (DCO) gamete is, by definition, one that is the result of simultaneous recombination events in both the $A$-$B$ interval and the $B$-$C$ interval. In terms of probability theory, a DCO gamete corresponds to the joint occurrence of events $E_{AB}$ and $E_{BC}$. The probability of a DCO, denoted as $P(\\text{DCO})$, is thus the probability of the intersection of these two events:\n$$P(\\text{DCO}) = P(E_{AB} \\cap E_{BC})$$\n\nThe problem explicitly states the critical assumption of **no crossover interference**. This statement has a precise mathematical meaning: the occurrence of a crossover event in one genomic interval has no influence on the probability of a crossover event in an adjacent interval. This means that the events $E_{AB}$ and $E_{BC}$ are statistically independent.\n\nFor two independent events, the probability of their joint occurrence is the product of their individual probabilities. Applying this fundamental axiom of probability theory, we have:\n$$P(E_{AB} \\cap E_{BC}) = P(E_{AB}) \\times P(E_{BC})$$\n\nSubstituting the probabilities with the given recombination fractions, we derive the expression for the expected probability of a DCO gamete:\n$$P(\\text{DCO}) = r_{AB} \\times r_{BC}$$\nThis is the desired expression from first principles for the expected probability of a double crossover gamete under the assumption of no interference.\n\nThe problem also mentions that the coefficient of coincidence ($C.O.C.$) is equal to $1$. This is merely a restatement of the no-interference assumption. The coefficient of coincidence is formally defined as the ratio of the observed DCO frequency to the expected DCO frequency under the hypothesis of independence:\n$$C.O.C. = \\frac{\\text{Observed DCO frequency}}{\\text{Expected DCO frequency}} = \\frac{P(E_{AB} \\cap E_{BC})}{P(E_{AB}) \\times P(E_{BC})}$$\nSetting $C.O.C. = 1$ directly enforces the condition $P(E_{AB} \\cap E_{BC}) = P(E_{AB}) \\times P(E_{BC})$, confirming our use of the independence rule.\n\nThe problem requires the expected number of DCO progeny, which we denote as $E[N_{\\text{DCO}}]$, from a total of $n$ progeny. Since each of the $n$ progeny results from a randomly drawn gamete, and these draws are independent trials, the number of DCO progeny follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n$ (number of trials) and $p = P(\\text{DCO})$ (probability of success on each trial).\n\nThe expected value of a binomial distribution $B(n, p)$ is given by the product $np$. Therefore, the expected number of DCO progeny is:\n$$E[N_{\\text{DCO}}] = n \\times P(\\text{DCO})$$\n\nSubstituting our derived expression for $P(\\text{DCO})$, we obtain the final expression for the expected number of DCO progeny as a function of $n$, $r_{AB}$, and $r_{BC}$:\n$$E[N_{\\text{DCO}}] = n \\times r_{AB} \\times r_{BC}$$\n\nNow, we must evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values: $n = 20{,}000$, $r_{AB} = 0.12$, and $r_{BC} = 0.08$.\n\n$$E[N_{\\text{DCO}}] = 20{,}000 \\times 0.12 \\times 0.08$$\n$$E[N_{\\text{DCO}}] = 20{,}000 \\times 0.0096$$\n$$E[N_{\\text{DCO}}] = (2 \\times 10^4) \\times (9.6 \\times 10^{-3})$$\n$$E[N_{\\text{DCO}}] = 2 \\times 9.6 \\times 10^{(4-3)}$$\n$$E[N_{\\text{DCO}}] = 19.2 \\times 10^1$$\n$$E[N_{\\text{DCO}}] = 192$$\n\nThe expected number of double crossover progeny is exactly $192$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{192}$$", "id": "2802714"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the ideal to the practical, this problem uses a realistic dataset from a three-point testcross to explore the consequences of interference.

A progeny is recombinant for A and C if its alleles for these two markers differ from the parental configuration. In a testcross with parental chromosomes `A B C` and `a b c`, the parental gametes are `ABC` and `abc`.\n- SCO in A–B produces gametes `aBC` and `Abc`.

A recombination fraction $r$ is an estimate of map distance $m$ (in Morgans), but they are not equal, related by a mapping function (e.g., Haldane's or Kosambi's). For any non-infinitesimal interval, $r  m$ because of undetected multiple crossovers *within* that interval. The statement's claim that this equality holds \"for intervals of any size\" is fundamentally false. For example, if $m_{AB}$ were $30$ cM, $r_{AB}$ would be significantly less than $0.3$. Additivity applies to map distances ($m_{AC} = m_{AB} + m_{BC}$ by definition), not recombination fractions. The statement incorrectly equates a recombination fraction with a sum of map distances.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C.

This is the correct mechanistic reason why DCOs are counted as parental (non-recombinant) types in a two-point cross involving only the outer markers.\nThe consequence described is that the reported two-point recombination fraction $r_{AC,\\text{reported}}$ will be less than the sum of the recombination fractions of the constituent intervals, $r_{AB} + r_{BC}$, when DCOs are present. As shown in the analysis for option A, $r_{AC,\\text{reported}} = (r_{AB} + r_{BC}) - 2 \\times f(DCO)_{\\text{obs}}$. If $f(DCO)_{\\text{obs}}  0$, then $r_{AC,\\text{reported}}  r_{AB} + r_{BC}$.

Since the intervals $M_0\\text{–}M_1$ and $M_2\\text{–}M_3$ are on opposite sides of the centromere, this interference is acting across the centromeric region.\n\nThe low recombination rate in the central, centromeric interval ($r_{12} = 0.01$) is a separate phenomenon, known as centromeric suppression of recombination or a \"cold spot.\" This does not, however, explain the result for the flanking intervals under the assumption of independence. The calculation of the expected DCO frequency for the flanking intervals *is independent* of the recombination rate in the middle interval. The concept of the coefficient of coincidence is precisely to isolate the effect of interference from the baseline, position-specific recombination rates.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. The data support positive chiasma interference extending across the centromere; the low coefficient of coincidence reflects suppression of coincident crossovers beyond what is expected from the local recombination fractions.**\nOur calculation yielded a coefficient of coincidence $C = 0.4$, which is significantly less than $1$. This is the definition of positive chiasma interference. The intervals are separated by the centromere, so the interference is indeed extending across it. The expected value ($30$ DCOs) is derived from the local recombination fractions ($r_{01}$ and $r_{23}$). The observed value ($12$) is a suppression relative to this expectation. This statement accurately describes the conclusion from the data analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The low coefficient of coincidence is fully explained by the reduced recombination rate in the central interval near the centromere; even with independent crossovers, a cold spot in the middle interval depresses double recombinants between the flanking intervals.**\nThis statement is logically flawed. The expected frequency of double recombinants in the flanking intervals, assuming independence, is calculated as $r_{01} \\times r_{23}$. This calculation does not involve $r_{12}$. Therefore, the low value of $r_{12}$ (the \"cold spot\") does not mathematically explain the deficit of DCOs under the model of independence. The deficit is precisely the deviation from the prediction of the independence model, and this deviation is what we define as interference.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Between-meiosis heterogeneity in overall crossover activity (a mixture of meioses with different global rates) is a more parsimonious explanation; such heterogeneity lowers the coefficient of coincidence below $1$ even without interference.**\nWhile it is true that heterogeneity in recombination rates among a population of meioses can lead to a calculated coefficient of coincidence less than $1$, this is not the most parsimonious explanation. Chiasma interference is a well-established, fundamental biological mechanism acting within a single meiosis to regulate crossover distribution. Invoking a population-level phenomenon (heterogeneity) requires additional assumptions about the distribution of rates across meioses for which there is no direct evidence in the problem. The standard, most direct interpretation of $C  1$ is chiasma interference.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The deficit of double recombinants across flanking intervals is expected under independence because centromere-spanning double crossovers necessarily exhibit chromatid interference that reduces the observable product below $r_{01}\\,r_{23}$, so no chiasma interference need be invoked.**\nThis option contradicts a direct instruction in the problem statement, which says to \"Assume no chromatid interference unless explicitly stated.\" Introducing chromatid interference as the explanation violates this premise. Therefore, within the framework of the problem, this explanation is not valid. The standard model for calculating expected DCOs and interference assumes no chromatid interference.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThe only conclusion that is rigorously supported by a standard analysis of the provided data under the given principles is that of positive chiasma interference.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2802733"}]}
