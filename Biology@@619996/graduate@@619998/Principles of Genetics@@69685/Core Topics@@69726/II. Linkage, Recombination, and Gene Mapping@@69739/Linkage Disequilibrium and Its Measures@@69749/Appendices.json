It requires the computation of standard measures of linkage disequilibrium (LD) from given haplotype count data. We shall proceed with a systematic, step-by-step calculation based on fundamental definitions in population genetics.\n\nThe analysis begins with the provided data for a sample of $N=100$ phased chromosomes. The observed counts for the four possible haplotypes at two biallelic loci, $A/a$ and $B/b$, are:\n- $n_{AB} = 34$\n- $n_{Ab} = 6$\n- $n_{aB} = 10$\n- $n_{ab} = 50$\n\nThe sum of these counts is $34 + 6 + 10 + 50 = 100$, which matches the total sample size $N$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the observed haplotype frequencies, denoted by $p$ with the corresponding haplotype as a subscript. The frequency of a haplotype is its count divided by the total number of chromosomes in the sample.\n\nThe frequency of the $AB$ haplotype is:\n$$p_{AB} = \\frac{n_{AB}}{N} = \\frac{34}{100} = 0.34$$\nThe frequency of the $Ab$ haplotype is:\n$$p_{Ab} = \\frac{n_{Ab}}{N} = \\frac{6}{100} = 0.06$$\nThe frequency of the $aB$ haplotype is:\n$$p_{aB} = \\frac{n_{aB}}{N} = \\frac{10}{100} = 0.10$$\nThe frequency of the $ab$ haplotype is:\n$$p_{ab} = \\fracn_{ab}}{N} = \\frac{50}{100} = 0.50$$\nThe sum of these frequencies must be unity: $p_{AB} + p_{Ab} + p_{aB} + p_{ab} = 0.34 + 0.06 + 0.10 + 0.50 = 1.00$.\n\nNext, we calculate the marginal allele frequencies for each locus from the haplotype frequencies.\n\nFor the first locus ($A/a$):\nThe frequency of allele $A$, denoted $p_A$, is the sum of frequencies of haplotypes containing $A$:\n$$p_A = p_{AB} + p_{Ab} = 0.34 + 0.06 = 0.40$$\nThe frequency of allele $a$, denoted $p_a$, is the sum of frequencies of haplotypes containing $a$:\n$$p_a = p_{aB} + p_{ab} = 0.10 + 0.50 = 0.60$$\nAs a check, $p_A + p_a = 0.40 + 0.60 = 1.00$.\n\nFor the second locus ($B/b$):\nThe frequency of allele $B$, denoted $p_B$, is the sum of frequencies of haplotypes containing $B$:\n$$p_B = p_{AB} + p_{aB} = 0.34 + 0.10 = 0.44$$\nThe frequency of allele $b$, denoted $p_b$, is the sum of frequencies of haplotypes containing $b$:\n$$p_b = p_{Ab} + p_{ab} = 0.06 + 0.50 = 0.56$$\nAs a check, $p_B + p_b = 0.44 + 0.56 = 1.00$.\n\nNow we compute the linkage disequilibrium coefficient, $D$. Linkage disequilibrium measures the non-random association of alleles at different loci. $D$ is defined as the difference between the observed frequency of a haplotype (e.g., $AB$) and the expected frequency if the alleles were associated randomly (i.e., at linkage equilibrium). The expected frequency of the $AB$ haplotype under equilibrium is the product of the marginal allele frequencies, $p_A p_B$.\n\n$$D = p_{AB} - p_A p_B$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$D = 0.34 - (0.40 \\times 0.44) = 0.34 - 0.176 = 0.164$$\nThe positive value of $D$ indicates an excess of $AB$ haplotypes (and consequently $ab$ haplotypes) compared to the expectation under independence.\n\nNext, we compute the normalized linkage disequilibrium coefficient, $D'$. This metric scales $D$ to the range $[-1, 1]$ by dividing it by its maximum possible absolute value given the allele frequencies. The bounds for $D$ are given by:\n$$\\max(-p_A p_B, -p_a p_b) \\le D \\le \\min(p_A p_b, p_a p_B)$$\nSince our calculated $D = 0.164$ is positive, we use the upper bound, $D_{max}$, for normalization:\n$$D_{max} = \\min(p_A p_b, p_a p_B)$$\nWe calculate the terms inside the minimum function:\n$$p_A p_b = 0.40 \\times 0.56 = 0.224$$\n$$p_a p_B = 0.60 \\times 0.44 = 0.264$$\nThus, $D_{max} = \\min(0.224, 0.264) = 0.224$.\nThe normalized coefficient $D'$ is then:\n$$D' = \\frac{D}{D_{max}} = \\frac{0.164}{0.224} \\approx 0.7321428...$$\n\nFinally, we compute the squared correlation coefficient, $r^2$, another common measure of LD. It is related to the chi-square statistic for association and ranges from $0$ (no association) to $1$ (complete association). The formula is:\n$$r^2 = \\frac{D^2}{p_A p_a p_B p_b}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$r^2 = \\frac{(0.164)^2}{(0.40)(0.60)(0.44)(0.56)} = \\frac{0.026896}{0.24 \\times 0.2464} = \\frac{0.026896}{0.059136} \\approx 0.4548498...$$\n\nThe problem requires reporting the numerical values for $D$, $D'$, and $r^2$ rounded to four significant figures.\n- $D = 0.1640$\n- $D' \\approx 0.7321$\n- $r^2 \\approx 0.4548$\n\nAccording to the provided classification rule, since $r^2 \\approx 0.4548$ falls within the range $0.2 \\le r^2 < 0.8$, the linkage disequilibrium between these two loci is classified as moderate.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.1640 & 0.7321 & 0.4548\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2831172"}, {"introduction": "While $D$, $D'$, and $r^2$ all quantify linkage disequilibrium, they are not interchangeable and can sometimes tell very different stories, particularly when allele frequencies are skewed.

A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nFirst, we establish the necessary definitions and baseline values from the given constraints.\nThe marginal allele frequencies are specified as $p_A = 0.05$ and $p_B = 0.05$.\nThe frequencies of the alternative alleles are therefore:\n$p_a = 1 - p_A = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$\n$p_b = 1 - p_B = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$\n\nThe linkage disequilibrium coefficient, $D$, is defined as the deviation of the observed frequency of the $AB$ haplotype, $P_{AB}$, from the frequency expected at linkage equilibrium:\n$$D = P_{AB} - p_A p_B$$\n\nThe squared correlation coefficient, $r^2$, is defined as:\n$$r^2 = \\frac{D^2}{p_A p_a p_B p_b}$$\nFor the given allele frequencies, the denominator is:\n$$p_A p_a p_B p_b = (0.05)(0.95)(0.05)(0.95) = (0.0475)^2 = 0.00225625$$\n\nThe normalized linkage disequilibrium coefficient, $D'$, scales $D$ by its theoretical maximum or minimum possible value, given the allele frequencies.\nIf $D > 0$, $D' = D / D_{max}$, where $D_{max} = \\min(p_A p_b, p_a p_B)$.\nIf $D < 0$, $D' = D / D_{min}$, where $D_{min} = \\max(-p_A p_B, -p_a p_b)$.\n\nLet us calculate these bounds:\n$D_{max} = \\min(0.05 \\times 0.95, 0.95 \\times 0.05) = \\min(0.0475, 0.0475) = 0.0475$.\n$D_{min} = \\max(-0.05 \\times 0.05, -0.95 \\times 0.95) = \\max(-0.0025, -0.9025) = -0.0025$.\n\nThe problem requires a configuration with $|D'| \\approx 1$ and a small $r^2$. We will now analyze each option.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. $(0, 0.05, 0.05, 0.90)$**\n- **Constraint Check**:\n  - The sum of haplotype frequencies is $0 + 0.05 + 0.05 + 0.90 = 1$. This is valid.\n  - The resulting allele frequencies are:\n    $p_A = P_{AB} + P_{Ab} = 0 + 0.05 = 0.05$. This matches the constraint.\n    $p_B = P_{AB} + P_{aB} = 0 + 0.05 = 0.05$. This also matches the constraint.\n  - The haplotype configuration is consistent with the problem statement.\n\n- **Metric Calculation**:\n  - $D = P_{AB} - p_A p_B = 0 - (0.05)(0.05) = -0.0025$.\n  - Since $D < 0$, we use $D_{min}$ for normalization.\n  - $D' = D / D_{min} = -0.0025 / -0.0025 = 1$. Thus, $|D'| = 1$. This satisfies the condition $|D'| \\approx 1$.\n  - $r^2 = \\frac{D^2}{p_A p_a p_B p_b} = \\frac{(-0.0025)^2}{0.00225625} = \\frac{0.00000625}{0.00225625} \\approx 0.00277$. This value is small.\n\n- **Claim Evaluation**: The claim states that this configuration has rare alleles in repulsion, leading to $|D'| \\approx 1$ while $r^2$ is small. Our calculations confirm this: we found $|D'| = 1$ and $r^2 \\approx 0.00277$. The absence of the $AB$ haplotype ($P_{AB}=0$) signifies complete repulsion between the two rare alleles, $A$ and $B$. This drives the disequilibrium to its minimum possible value, $D = D_{min} = -0.0025$, thus saturating the normalized measure, $|D'| = 1$. However, because the absolute deviation $D$ is small, and due to the definition of $r^2$, the squared correlation remains low. The claim correctly articulates that the saturation of $D'$ does not imply strong predictive coupling (high $r^2$), especially when allele frequencies constrain the maximum possible value of $D$. The explanation is sound.\n\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. $(0.05, 0, 0, 0.95)$**\n- **Constraint Check**:\n  - Sum of frequencies: $0.05 + 0 + 0 + 0.95 = 1$. Valid.\n  - Allele frequencies:\n    $p_A = P_{AB} + P_{Ab} = 0.05 + 0 = 0.05$. Matches.\n    $p_B = P_{AB} + P_{aB} = 0.05 + 0 = 0.05$. Matches.\n  - The haplotype configuration is consistent.\n\n- **Metric Calculation**:\n  - $D = P_{AB} - p_A p_B = 0.05 - (0.05)(0.05) = 0.05 - 0.0025 = 0.0475$.\n  - Since $D > 0$, we use $D_{max}$ for normalization.\n  - $D' = D / D_{max} = 0.0475 / 0.0475 = 1$. Thus, $|D'| = 1$.\n  - $r^2 = \\frac{D^2}{p_A p_a p_B p_b} = \\frac{(0.0475)^2}{(0.05)(0.95)(0.05)(0.95)} = \\frac{(0.0475)^2}{(0.0475)^2} = 1$.\n\n- **Claim Evaluation**: The claim states that $|D'| \\approx 1$ and $r^2$ is small. Our calculation shows $r^2 = 1$, which is the maximum possible value, not small. This configuration represents complete coupling of the rare alleles, which for symmetric allele frequencies ($p_A = p_B$) results in both $|D'| = 1$ and $r^2 = 1$. The claim is factually incorrect.\n\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $(0.0025, 0.0475, 0.0475, 0.9025)$**\n- **Constraint Check**:\n  - Sum of frequencies: $0.0025 + 0.0475 + 0.0475 + 0.9025 = 1$. Valid.\n  - Allele frequencies:\n    $p_A = P_{AB} + P_{Ab} = 0.0025 + 0.0475 = 0.05$. Matches.\n    $p_B = P_{AB} + P_{aB} = 0.0025 + 0.0475 = 0.05$. Matches.\n  - The haplotype configuration is consistent.\n\n- **Metric Calculation**:\n  - $D = P_{AB} - p_A p_B = 0.0025 - (0.05)(0.05) = 0.0025 - 0.0025 = 0$.\n  - Since $D=0$, both $D'$ and $r^2$ must be $0$.\n\n- **Claim Evaluation**: The claim states this configuration gives $|D'| \\approx 1$. This is false; it gives $|D'| = 0$ because the system is at linkage equilibrium ($D = 0$).\n\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $(0, 0.05, 0.45, 0.50)$**\n- **Constraint Check**:\n  - Sum of frequencies: $0 + 0.05 + 0.45 + 0.50 = 1$. Valid.\n  - Allele frequencies:\n    $p_A = P_{AB} + P_{Ab} = 0 + 0.05 = 0.05$. This matches the constraint.\n    $p_B = P_{AB} + P_{aB} = 0 + 0.45 = 0.45$. This **does not match** the problem's explicit constraint that $p_B = 0.05$.\n\n- **Claim Evaluation**: The provided haplotype frequencies are inconsistent with the given input parameter $p_B = 0.05$. Therefore, this option is invalid from the outset and cannot be the correct answer. The question demands a configuration that satisfies the allele-frequency constraints.\n\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nConclusion: Option A is the only choice where the haplotype frequencies are consistent with the allele frequency constraints, satisfy the conditions $|D'| \\approx 1$ and small $r^2$, and provide a correct theoretical explanation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2825908"}, {"introduction": "In practice, genetic data often comes in the form of unphased genotypes, where we know an individual's alleles but not which ones are on the same chromosome.
