This foundational exercise guides you through the essential steps of this process. You will start by estimating the recombination fraction directly from experimental data and then delve into the crucial conceptual distinction between this observable frequency and the true underlying rate of physical crossovers, a difference caused by double crossover events. Finally, you will apply standard mapping functions to convert your estimated recombination fraction into a more accurate measure of map distance, expressed in centimorgans [@problem_id:2863959].", "problem": "A diploid species has two loci, $X$ and $Y$, that can be scored unambiguously in a two-point testcross, where a double heterozygote in coupling phase, $XY/xy$, is crossed to a double homozygous recessive tester, $xy/xy$. From a progeny sample of size $N = 1000$, the following totals are observed: $R = 240$ recombinant progeny (phenotypes $Xy$ or $xY$) and $N-R = 760$ parental-type progeny (phenotypes $XY$ or $xy$).\n\nStarting only from fundamental definitions and well-tested facts about recombination fraction, likelihood for binomial sampling, and the biological meaning of a mapping function, do the following:\n\n1) Using the definition of recombination fraction as the probability that a randomly chosen gamete from the double heterozygote is recombinant over the interval, write down the maximum likelihood estimator $\\hat r$ of the recombination fraction $r$ and compute its value from the data.\n\n2) Using the structure of the binomial model for $R$ given $N$ and $r$, assess whether $\\hat r$ is unbiased for $r$. Then, explain carefully why $r$ itself is not equal to the expected number of crossovers along the interval per meiosis, and why double crossovers cause $\\hat r$ to be biased downward as an estimator of the underlying crossover rate along the interval. Your explanation should connect the observable recombination fraction to the (unobserved) parity of crossover events.\n\n3) Convert your estimate $\\hat r$ into map distance under two classical mapping functions: the Haldane mapping function (no interference; crossovers along the bivalent follow a Poisson process) and the Kosambi mapping function (positive interference such that adjacent intervals are not independent).

Do not include any units in your final numeric entry.", "solution": "The problem as stated is a standard exercise in quantitative genetics and is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides all necessary data and definitions for a unique solution. We shall proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe problem asks for three distinct tasks. We will address them in sequence.\n\n1) The first task is to find the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the recombination fraction, $r$. The recombination fraction is defined as the probability that a gamete produced by the heterozygote is recombinant. In a two-point testcross, recombinant progeny arise from recombinant gametes. Therefore, the number of recombinant progeny, $R$, out of a total of $N$ progeny, can be modeled as a binomial random variable.\n\nThe process of observing a single progeny is a Bernoulli trial where \"success\" corresponds to the progeny being recombinant (with probability $r$) and \"failure\" corresponds to the progeny being of a parental type (with probability $1-r$). For a sample of $N$ independent progeny, the number of successes $R$ follows a binomial distribution, $R \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N, r)$. The probability mass function is given by:\n$$P(R=k | N, r) = \\binom{N}{k} r^k (1-r)^{N-k}$$\nThe likelihood function, $L(r)$, is this probability viewed as a function of the parameter $r$ given the observed data $R$:\n$$L(r; R) = \\binom{N}{R} r^{R} (1-r)^{N-R}$$\nTo find the value of $r$ that maximizes this function, it is standard procedure to maximize the log-likelihood function, $\\ln L(r)$, as the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function.\n$$\\ln L(r) = \\ln\\binom{N}{R} + R\\ln(r) + (N-R)\\ln(1-r)$$\nWe find the maximum by taking the first derivative with respect to $r$ and setting it to zero.\n$$\\frac{d}{dr}\\ln L(r) = \\frac{R}{r} - \\frac{N-R}{1-r}$$\nSetting the derivative to zero yields the MLE, which we denote as $\\hat{r}$:\n$$\\frac{R}{\\hat{r}} - \\frac{N-R}{1-\\hat{r}} = 0$$\n$$R(1-\\hat{r}) = (N-R)\\hat{r}$$\n$$R - R\\hat{r} = N\\hat{r} - R\\hat{r}$$\n$$R = N\\hat{r}$$\nThus, the maximum likelihood estimator for the recombination fraction is the sample proportion of recombinants:\n$$\\hat{r} = \\frac{R}{N}$$\nUsing the provided data, $R = 240$ and $N = 1000$:\n$$\\hat{r} = \\frac{240}{1000} = 0.24$$\n\n2) The second task is to assess the bias of $\\hat{r}$ and explain the relationship between the recombination fraction and the true number of crossover events.\n\nFirst, let us assess the bias of $\\hat{r}$ as an estimator for $r$. The expectation of the estimator is:\n$$E[\\hat{r}] = E\\left[\\frac{R}{N}\\right] = \\frac{1}{N}E[R]$$\nFor a binomial distribution $\\text{Binomial}(N, r)$, the expected value of the random variable $R$ is $E[R] = Nr$. Substituting this into the equation for $E[\\hat{r}]$:\n$$E[\\hat{r}] = \\frac{1}{N}(Nr) = r$$\nSince the expected value of the estimator is equal to the true parameter, $E[\\hat{r}] = r$, the estimator $\\hat{r}$ is an **unbiased** estimator of the recombination fraction $r$.\n\nNext, we must explain why the recombination fraction $r$ is not equal to the expected number of crossovers, which we denote as $m$. A physical crossover is an exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids during meiosis. Recombination between two loci is the observable outcome, which occurs if and only if there is an **odd number** of crossovers in the interval between the two loci. An even number of crossovers ($0$, $2$, $4$, ...) restores the parental linkage of alleles on the resulting chromatid and thus does not lead to a recombinant gamete.\n\nLet $P(k)$ be the probability of having exactly $k$ crossovers in the interval. The recombination fraction $r$ is the sum of probabilities of all outcomes with an odd number of crossovers:\n$$r = P(1) + P(3) + P(5) + \\dots = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} P(2j+1)$$\nThe expected number of crossovers, $m$, is defined as:\n$$m = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} k \\cdot P(k) = 0 \\cdot P(0) + 1 \\cdot P(1) + 2 \\cdot P(2) + 3 \\cdot P(3) + \\dots$$\nIt is clear from these definitions that $r \\neq m$. Specifically, double crossovers ($k=2$) contribute twice to the value of $m$ but do not contribute at all to $r$. In fact, they contribute to the frequency of parental-type gametes, $1-r$. In general, any even number of crossovers is \"invisible\" to the measurement of recombination, and odd numbers of crossovers greater than one (e.g., $k=3$) are scored as a single recombinant event. This \"masking\" effect of multiple crossovers causes the observed recombination fraction $r$ to be an underestimate of the true mean number of crossovers $m$. Therefore, $r \\le m$. The estimator $\\hat{r}$, being an unbiased estimate of $r$, is consequently a downwardly biased estimator of the underlying map distance $m$. The bias, $E[\\hat{r}] - m = r - m$, is non-positive.\n\n3) The third task is to convert the estimated recombination fraction $\\hat{r} = 0.24$ into map distance using two mapping functions. A mapping function is a mathematical formula that relates the unobservable map distance $m$ (in Morgans) to the observable recombination fraction $r$. The map distance is defined as the expected number of crossovers per meiosis. We seek an estimate of $m$, denoted $d$.\n\nThe Haldane mapping function assumes no interference, which means crossovers occur as a Poisson process. The probability of $k$ crossovers is $P(k) = \\frac{e^{-m} m^k}{k!}$. The recombination fraction is:\n$$r = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - e^{-2m})$$\nSolving for the map distance, which we call $d_H$ for Haldane:\n$$2r = 1 - e^{-2d_H} \\implies e^{-2d_H} = 1 - 2r \\implies d_H = -\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(1-2r)$$\nUsing our estimate $\\hat{r} = 0.24$:\n$$d_H = -\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(1 - 2(0.24)) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(0.52) \\approx 0.3270 \\text{ Morgans}$$\nIn centimorgans, this is $32.70$ cM.\n\nThe Kosambi mapping function assumes a model of positive interference. The relationship is:\n$$r = \\frac{1}{2}\\tanh(2m)$$\nSolving for the map distance, $d_K$ for Kosambi:\n$$2r = \\tanh(2d_K) \\implies 2d_K = \\arctanh(2r) \\implies d_K = \\frac{1}{2}\\arctanh(2r)$$\nThe inverse hyperbolic tangent can be expressed using the natural logarithm: $\\arctanh(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1+x}{1-x}\\right)$.\n$$d_K = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1+2r}{1-2r}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{1}{4}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1+2r}{1-2r}\\right)$$\nUsing our estimate $\\hat{r} = 0.24$:\n$$d_K = \\frac{1}{4}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1+2(0.24)}{1-2(0.24)}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1.48}{0.52}\\right) \\approx 0.261476 \\text{ Morgans}$$\nTo express this distance in centimorgans (cM), we multiply by $100$.\n$$d_{K, \\text{cM}} = 100 \\times d_K \\approx 26.1476$$\nRounding this to four significant figures as required gives $26.15$ cM.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{26.15}$$", "id": "2863959"}, {"introduction": "Before any calculation of distance can be made, a geneticist must first correctly identify the parental and recombinant progeny. This critical determination depends on knowing the linkage phase—whether alleles are in coupling ($AB/ab$) or repulsion ($Ab/aB$)— in the heterozygous parent. This practice challenges you to infer the correct phase from raw progeny data and demonstrates the profound impact of misinterpreting it. By working through the consequences of an incorrect assumption, you will gain a deeper appreciation for why establishing the linkage phase is a non-negotiable first step in linkage analysis [@problem_id:2863988].", "problem": "A diploid organism segregates for two linked genes, denoted by alleles $A/a$ and $B/b$. A single heterozygous individual of unknown phase at these loci is testcrossed to a doubly homozygous recessive tester ($ab/ab$).

You observe the following progeny counts across $N=1200$ offspring: $AB=487$, $Ab=113$, $aB=97$, and $ab=503$. Assume no viability selection, no segregation distortion, and that the two recombinant classes have equal expected frequencies under a given phase.

Determination of Parental Phase**\n\nIn a testcross involving linked genes, the parental (non-recombinant) gametic combinations are, by definition, produced more frequently than the recombinant combinations. The progeny phenotypes directly reflect the gametes contributed by the heterozygous parent, as the tester parent contributes only recessive alleles ($ab$).\n\nThe observed progeny counts are:\n-   $n_{AB} = 487$\n-   $n_{ab} = 503$\n-   $n_{Ab} = 113$\n-   $n_{aB} = 97$\n\nThe two most frequent classes are those corresponding to the $AB$ and $ab$ gametes, with combined counts of $487+503=990$. The two least frequent classes are those corresponding to the $Ab$ and $aB$ gametes, with combined counts of $113+97=210$.\n\nTherefore, the parental gametes produced by the heterozygote were $AB$ and $ab$. This means the alleles in the heterozygous parent were arranged on the homologous chromosomes as $AB/ab$, which is defined as the **coupling phase**. The gametes $Ab$ and $aB$ are the recombinant types.\n\n**2. Derivation and Computation of the Correct MLE for $r$**\n\nLet $r$ be the recombination fraction. The probabilities of producing each type of gamete from the coupling-phase parent ($AB/ab$) are:\n-   $P(\\text{Parental}) = 1-r$. The two parental types, $AB$ and $ab$, are expected to be produced in equal frequency, so $P(AB) = P(ab) = \\frac{1-r}{2}$.\n-   $P(\\text{Recombinant}) = r$. The two recombinant types, $Ab$ and $aB$, are also expected in equal frequency, so $P(Ab) = P(aB) = \\frac{r}{2}$.\n\nThe observed counts $(n_{AB}, n_{Ab}, n_{aB}, n_{ab})$ follow a multinomial distribution with total count $N$ and probabilities $(\\frac{1-r}{2}, \\frac{r}{2}, \\frac{r}{2}, \\frac{1-r}{2})$. The likelihood function $L(r)$ is proportional to the probability of observing this specific dataset:\n$$ L(r) \\propto \\left(\\frac{1-r}{2}\\right)^{n_{AB}} \\left(\\frac{r}{2}\\right)^{n_{Ab}} \\left(\\frac{r}{2}\\right)^{n_{aB}} \\left(\\frac{1-r}{2}\\right)^{n_{ab}} $$\n$$ L(r) \\propto (1-r)^{n_{AB} + n_{ab}} r^{n_{Ab} + n_{aB}} $$\nThe log-likelihood function, $\\ell(r) = \\ln L(r)$, is:\n$$ \\ell(r) = (n_{AB} + n_{ab})\\ln(1-r) + (n_{Ab} + n_{aB})\\ln(r) + C $$\nwhere $C$ is a constant that does not depend on $r$. To find the maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) $\\hat{r}$, we take the derivative of $\\ell(r)$ with respect to $r$ and set it to zero:\n$$ \\frac{d\\ell}{dr} = -\\frac{n_{AB} + n_{ab}}{1-r} + \\frac{n_{Ab} + n_{aB}}{r} = 0 $$\nSolving for $r$:\n$$ \\frac{n_{Ab} + n_{aB}}{r} = \\frac{n_{AB} + n_{ab}}{1-r} $$\n$$ (n_{Ab} + n_{aB})(1-r) = r(n_{AB} + n_{ab}) $$\n$$ n_{Ab} + n_{aB} = r(n_{Ab} + n_{aB} + n_{AB} + n_{ab}) $$\n$$ n_{Ab} + n_{aB} = r \\cdot N $$\nThus, the MLE for $r$ is:\n$$ \\hat{r} = \\frac{n_{Ab} + n_{aB}}{N} $$\nThis is the intuitive result: the estimate of the recombination frequency is the observed frequency of recombinant progeny. Using the given data:\n$$ \\hat{r} = \\frac{113 + 97}{1200} = \\frac{210}{1200} = \\frac{7}{40} = 0.175 $$\n\n**3. Analysis Under Misassigned Phase and Bias Calculation**\n\nSuppose an analyst mistakenly assumes the parent was in the **repulsion phase** ($Ab/aB$). Under this incorrect assumption, the classification of gametes is inverted:\n-   Parental types are now $Ab$ and $aB$.\n-   Recombinant types are now $AB$ and $ab$.\n\nThe derivation for the MLE is structurally identical, but the roles of the counts are swapped. The unconstrained estimator for $r$, which we denote $\\tilde{r}$, would be the number of misidentified \"recombinants\" divided by the total:\n$$ \\tilde{r} = \\frac{n_{AB} + n_{ab}}{N} $$\nUsing the given data:\n$$ \\tilde{r} = \\frac{487 + 503}{1200} = \\frac{990}{1200} = \\frac{33}{40} = 0.825 $$\nHowever, the recombination fraction $r$ is biologically constrained to the interval $[0, 0.5]$, because a value of $r > 0.5$ implies that the \"recombinant\" gametes are more frequent than the \"parental\" gametes, which contradicts the definition of recombination under the chosen phase. The correct interpretation in such a case is that the phase assignment was wrong.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, we must find the constrained MLE, $\\tilde{r}_c$, on the interval $[0, 0.5]$. The log-likelihood function for this misassigned model is $\\ell_{mis}(r) = (n_{Ab} + n_{aB})\\ln(1-r) + (n_{AB} + n_{ab})\\ln(r)$. Its unconstrained maximum is at $\\tilde{r}=0.825$. We evaluate its derivative on the interval $[0, 0.5]$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\ell_{mis}}{dr} = -\\frac{210}{1-r} + \\frac{990}{r} = \\frac{-210r + 990(1-r)}{r(1-r)} = \\frac{990 - 1200r}{r(1-r)} $$\nFor $r \\in (0, 0.5)$, the numerator $990 - 1200r$ is always positive (e.g., at $r=0.5$, it is $990 - 600 = 390$). Since the derivative is positive throughout the interval $[0, 0.5]$, the function $\\ell_{mis}(r)$ is monotonically increasing on this interval. Therefore, the maximum value on the closed interval $[0, 0.5]$ occurs at the boundary point $r = 0.5$.\n\nThe boundary-constrained estimator under misassignment is thus $\\tilde{r}_c = 0.5$.\n\nFinally, we compute the required absolute bias:\n$$ |\\tilde{r}_c - \\hat{r}| = |0.5 - 0.175| = |0.325| = 0.325 $$\nRounding to 4 significant figures as requested gives $0.3250$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.3250}\n$$", "id": "2863988"}, {"introduction": "While two-point crosses are excellent for measuring distance, the three-point testcross is the classic tool for determining gene order and quantifying crossover interference.

This requires a sequential process: first, inferring the gene order; second, classifying all progeny; third, calculating recombination frequencies; and finally, computing the interference.\n\nStep 1: Infer Gene Order\nThe problem states that the two most frequent progeny classes are the nonrecombinant (parental, NCO) types, and the two least frequent are the double crossover (DCO) types.\n-   Nonrecombinant (NCO) classes: $ABC$ (count $405$) and $abc$ (count $400$). These represent the gametes produced without any crossover event between the three loci. The total NCO count is $N_{NCO} = 405 + 400 = 805$.\n-   Double Crossover (DCO) classes: $AbC$ (count $2$) and $aBc$ (count $3$). These represent gametes resulting from crossovers in both intervals simultaneously. The total DCO count is $N_{DCO} = 2 + 3 = 5$.\n\nTo determine the gene order, we compare the allelic configuration of a parental chromosome with a DCO chromosome. A double crossover event results in the exchange of the central gene's allele relative to the flanking genes. For example, comparing the parental class $ABC$ to the double crossover class $AbC$, the alleles at the $A$ and $C$ loci are the same, while the allele at the $B$ locus has been exchanged. This indicates that locus $B$ is positioned between loci $A$ and $C$. The correct gene order is therefore $A-B-C$.\n\nStep 2: Classify All Progeny\nWith the gene order established as $A-B-C$, we can categorize the remaining progeny, which are the single crossover (SCO) types.\n-   Single Crossover in Interval $1$ ($A-B$) (SCO1): These progeny result from a single crossover event between loci $A$ and $B$. This exchanges the alleles downstream of the crossover point. The resulting gametes are $Abc$ and $aBC$. The observed counts are $57$ and $58$, respectively. The total SCO1 count is $N_{SCO1} = 57 + 58 = 115$.\n-   Single Crossover in Interval $2$ ($B-C$) (SCO2): These progeny result from a single crossover between loci $B$ and $C$. The resulting gametes are $ABc$ and $abC$. The observed counts are $36$ and $39$, respectively. The total SCO2 count is $N_{SCO2} = 36 + 39 = 75$.\n\nThe sum of all class counts is $N_{NCO} + N_{SCO1} + N_{SCO2} + N_{DCO} = 805 + 115 + 75 + 5 = 1000$, confirming our classification is exhaustive.\n\nStep 3: Compute Recombination Frequencies\nThe recombination fraction ($r$) between two loci is the proportion of total progeny that are recombinant for that interval. Progeny are considered recombinant for an interval if they are the result of any crossover event within that interval, which includes both single crossovers in that specific interval and all double crossovers.\n\n-   The recombination fraction between loci $A$ and $B$, denoted $r_{AB}$, is:\n$$r_{AB} = \\frac{N_{SCO1} + N_{DCO}}{N_{total}} = \\frac{115 + 5}{1000} = \\frac{120}{1000} = 0.12$$\n-   The recombination fraction between loci $B$ and $C$, denoted $r_{BC}$, is:\n$$r_{BC} = \\frac{N_{SCO2} + N_{DCO}}{N_{total}} = \\frac{75 + 5}{1000} = \\frac{80}{1000} = 0.08$$\n\nStep 4: Compute Interference\nInterference ($I$) measures the degree to which a crossover in one interval affects the likelihood of a crossover in an adjacent interval. It is defined in relation to the coefficient of coincidence ($C$). The coefficient of coincidence is the ratio of the observed frequency of double crossovers to the expected frequency of double crossovers.\n$$C = \\frac{f_{DCO, observed}}{f_{DCO, expected}}$$\nThe observed frequency of DCOs is the actual measured fraction of DCO progeny:\n$$f_{DCO, observed} = \\frac{N_{DCO}}{N_{total}} = \\frac{5}{1000} = 0.005$$\nThe expected frequency of DCOs is calculated under the hypothesis of no interference (i.e., that crossovers in adjacent intervals are independent events). This frequency is the product of the individual recombination frequencies for the two intervals:\n$$f_{DCO, expected} = r_{AB} \\times r_{BC} = 0.12 \\times 0.08 = 0.0096$$\nNow, we can compute the coefficient of coincidence, $C$:\n$$C = \\frac{0.005}{0.0096} = \\frac{5}{9.6} = \\frac{50}{96} = \\frac{25}{48}$$\nInterference ($I$) is defined as $I = 1 - C$.
