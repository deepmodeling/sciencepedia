This exercise challenges you to apply the fundamental principle that the time of entry for a genetic marker is directly proportional to its distance from the origin of transfer, $oriT$. By analyzing time-of-entry data from a hypothetical Hfr strain, you will deduce both the location and the transfer polarity of the integrated F factor on the circular chromosome, a foundational skill in genetic mapping [@problem_id:2791314].", "problem": "In bacterial conjugation, integration of the Fertility factor (F factor) into the chromosome yields High Frequency of Recombination (Hfr) strains. Conjugative deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) transfer initiates at the origin of transfer ($oriT$) within the integrated F factor and proceeds unidirectionally into the bacterial chromosome. Assume the following foundational facts: (i) transfer proceeds at an approximately constant velocity so that time-of-entry is proportional to chromosomal distance along the direction of transfer, and (ii) the Escherichia coli chromosome is circular and represented by a standard conjugation map of length $100$ minutes.\n\nA set of genetic markers is placed on a fixed circular reference map (in minutes) as follows:\n- $thr$ at $0$\n- $leu$ at $8$\n- $azi$ at $17$\n- $ton$ at $27$\n- $lac$ at $34$\n- $gal$ at $42$\n- $his$ at $55$\n- $pro$ at $68$\n- $ara$ at $79$\n- $tsx$ at $91$\n\nThree independent Hfr strains are studied by classic interrupted-mating time-of-entry experiments. For each Hfr strain, the earliest observed entry times (in minutes after mating initiation at $t=0$) for specific markers are recorded:\n- Hfr$1$: $lac$ at $4$, $gal$ at $12$, $his$ at $25$.\n- Hfr$2$: $pro$ at $2$, $his$ at $15$, $gal$ at $28$.\n- Hfr$3$: $thr$ at $5$, $leu$ at $13$, $azi$ at $22$.\n\nAssume uninterrupted conjugation for at least as long as the latest recorded time for each strain, negligible initiation lag, and that $1$ map minute corresponds to $1$ minute of transfer time. The chromosome coordinate increases clockwise; “clockwise” polarity means transfer proceeds in the direction of increasing minute coordinate, and “counterclockwise” polarity means transfer proceeds in the direction of decreasing minute coordinate.\n\nUsing only the definitions above and fundamental principles of conjugation mapping, determine the absolute minute coordinate (on the $0$ to $100$ minute map) of the origin of transfer ($oriT$) for Hfr$3$. Express your final answer in minutes on the reference map. Do not include units in your final boxed answer. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem presented is a standard exercise in genetic mapping based on bacterial conjugation. A critical assessment of its premises, data, and definitions confirms that the problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. It is based on the established principles of interrupted mating experiments pioneered by Jacob and Wollman. The provided data are sufficient and free of contradiction, allowing for a unique and logical solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and we may proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe core principle relates the time of entry of a genetic marker to its distance from the origin of transfer ($oriT$) on the bacterial chromosome. The problem specifies a circular chromosome of length $L=100$ minutes and a constant transfer rate where $1$ map minute of distance corresponds to $1$ minute of transfer time. Let $C_{marker}$ denote the coordinate of a given marker on the standard reference map, and let $t_{entry}$ be its earliest time of entry into the recipient cell. The location of the $oriT$, denoted by $C_{oriT}$, can be determined from this relationship.\n\nThe direction of transfer, or polarity, is crucial.\n1. For a **clockwise** transfer, proceeding in the direction of increasing map coordinates, the distance from $oriT$ to a marker is given by $(C_{marker} - C_{oriT}) \\pmod{L}$. Thus, the time of entry is $t_{entry} = (C_{marker} - C_{oriT}) \\pmod{L}$. Rearranging for the origin gives $C_{oriT} = (C_{marker} - t_{entry}) \\pmod{L}$.\n2. For a **counterclockwise** transfer, proceeding in the direction of decreasing map coordinates, the distance is $(C_{oriT} - C_{marker}) \\pmod{L}$. Thus, the time of entry is $t_{entry} = (C_{oriT} - C_{marker}) \\pmod{L}$. Rearranging gives $C_{oriT} = (C_{marker} + t_{entry}) \\pmod{L}$.\n\nThe problem requires us to determine $C_{oriT}$ for the Hfr$3$ strain. The experimental data for Hfr$3$ are:\n- Marker $thr$: map coordinate $C_{thr} = 0$, entry time $t_{thr} = 5$ minutes.\n- Marker $leu$: map coordinate $C_{leu} = 8$, entry time $t_{leu} = 13$ minutes.\n- Marker $azi$: map coordinate $C_{azi} = 17$, entry time $t_{azi} = 22$ minutes.\n\nFirst, we must deduce the polarity of transfer for Hfr$3$. The entry times indicate the order in which the markers are transferred: $thr$ (at $5$ min), followed by $leu$ (at $13$ min), followed by $azi$ (at $22$ min). The sequence of transfer is thus $thr \\rightarrow leu \\rightarrow azi$.\n\nNext, we examine the positions of these markers on the reference map. Their coordinates are $0$, $8$, and $17$, respectively. The order of marker position along the chromosome in the direction of increasing coordinates ($0 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 17$) matches the temporal order of their transfer. Therefore, the Hfr$3$ strain transfers its chromosome in the **clockwise** direction.\n\nWith the polarity established as clockwise, we apply the corresponding formula: $C_{oriT} = (C_{marker} - t_{entry}) \\pmod{100}$. We can use the data from any of the three markers to calculate $C_{oriT}$. We shall perform the calculation for all three to verify the consistency of the data and our model.\n\nUsing the marker $thr$:\n$$C_{oriT} = (C_{thr} - t_{thr}) \\pmod{100} = (0 - 5) \\pmod{100} = -5 \\pmod{100}$$\nTo express this coordinate in the standard range $[0, 100)$, we calculate $-5 + 100 = 95$. Thus, $C_{oriT} = 95$.\n\nUsing the marker $leu$:\n$$C_{oriT} = (C_{leu} - t_{leu}) \\pmod{100} = (8 - 13) \\pmod{100} = -5 \\pmod{100}$$\nThis yields the same result, $C_{oriT} = 95$.\n\nUsing the marker $azi$:\n$$C_{oriT} = (C_{azi} - t_{azi}) \\pmod{100} = (17 - 22) \\pmod{100} = -5 \\pmod{100}$$\nThis also gives $C_{oriT} = 95$.\n\nAll three markers provide a consistent location for the origin of transfer. The logical conclusion is that the $oriT$ for the Hfr$3$ strain is integrated at position $95$ on the $E. coli$ reference map. The transfer then proceeds clockwise from this point, reaching $thr$ at map position $0$ (which is $5$ minutes of distance from $95$) in $5$ minutes, $leu$ at map position $8$ (which is $13$ minutes of distance from $95$) in $13$ minutes, and $azi$ at map position $17$ (which is $22$ minutes of distance from $95$) in $22$ minutes, fully consistent with the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{95}$$", "id": "2791314"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principles of interrupted mating, this problem presents a critical thought experiment that explores the molecular requirements for forming a stable recombinant [@problem_id:2824311].

In the standard cross with a recombinase A (RecA) proficient recipient (recA$^{+}$), the apparent time-of-entry for three donor markers is determined by blending aliquots at successive times and plating on selective media for stable recombinants (only full-sized colonies are scored after sufficient incubation). Under these conditions, the first detectable stable recombinants for marker $\\mathrm{thr}^{+}$ appear at approximately $10$ minutes, for $\\mathrm{leu}^{+}$ at $16$ minutes, and for $\\mathrm{gal}^{+}$ at $22$ minutes; the maximal plateau recombinant frequencies at late time points are about $30\\%$, $20\\%$, and $10\\%$ for $\\mathrm{thr}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{leu}^{+}$, and $\\mathrm{gal}^{+}$, respectively. The experiment is then repeated with an otherwise identical setup, except the recipient carries a null mutation in recA (recA$^{-}$), eliminating RecA protein (recombinase A) function. All other parameters are unchanged, including donor strain, selection scheme, disruption method, plating protocol, and scoring criterion that counts only stable, full-sized colonies.

Which option best describes the outcome?\n\nA. Apparent entry times will shift earlier by a constant offset because recombination lag is eliminated, while maximal recombinant frequencies will remain approximately the same as in recA$^{+}$.\n\nB.

The RecBCD enzyme complex is functional in both recipient strains.\n    2.  Scoring criterion: only \"stable, full-sized colonies\" are counted as recombinants.\n*   **Objective:** Predict the outcome for apparent entry times and maximal recombinant frequencies in the experiment using the recA$^{-}$ recipient.\n\n**Step 2: Validation of Problem Statement**\n\nThe problem describes a classic experiment in bacterial genetics, the interrupted mating experiment of Wollman and Jacob. The components—Hfr donor, F$^{-}$ recipient, time-of-entry mapping, and recombination frequencies—are all standard concepts. The problem's core question hinges on the function of the RecA protein, which is central to homologous recombination in *Escherichia coli* and related bacteria. The provided data for the control experiment (times of entry and decreasing plateau frequencies for later markers) are entirely realistic and consistent with the principles of Hfr conjugation. The experimental modification (using a `recA` null mutant as the recipient) is a well-defined change with known-in-principle consequences. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains no contradictions or missing information essential to its resolution. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe solution requires an understanding of the sequential processes of bacterial conjugation and homologous recombination.\n\n1.  **DNA Transfer (Conjugation):** The Hfr donor cell initiates the transfer of its chromosome in a linear fashion into the F$^{-}$ recipient cell. The time at which a genetic marker physically enters the recipient is determined by its physical distance from the origin of transfer (`oriT`) on the Hfr chromosome. The `recA` status of the recipient cell has no effect on the machinery of DNA transfer—the formation of the mating bridge and the transport of the single-stranded DNA. Therefore, the physical transfer of the $\\mathrm{thr}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{leu}^{+}$, and $\\mathrm{gal}^{+}$ gene sequences into the recipient cytoplasm will still occur at approximately $10$, $16$, and $22$ minutes, respectively.\n\n2.  **Fate of Transferred DNA and Formation of Stable Recombinants:** The critical part of the question lies in the scoring criterion: \"only stable, full-sized colonies are scored\". For a recipient cell (e.g., initially $\\mathrm{thr}^{-}$) to form a full-sized colony on a selective medium lacking threonine, it must have stably incorporated the donor $\\mathrm{thr}^{+}$ allele into its own chromosome. This stable incorporation allows the allele to be replicated and inherited by all progeny during cell division. This process of incorporation is known as homologous recombination.\n\n3.  **The Role of RecA Protein:** In *E. coli*, the RecA protein is the essential catalyst for homologous recombination. It polymerizes on the incoming single-stranded donor DNA, forming a nucleoprotein filament. This filament then searches the recipient chromosome for a homologous sequence and mediates strand invasion, leading to the exchange of genetic material. In a `recA` null mutant (`recA^{-}`), this entire process is abolished. There is no functional homologous recombination pathway to integrate the transferred linear DNA fragment into the recipient's circular chromosome.\n\n4.  **Consequences in the `recA-` Recipient:**\n    *   **Lack of Integration:** When the $\\mathrm{thr}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{leu}^{+}$, or $\\mathrm{gal}^{+}$ markers enter the `recA-` recipient, they exist as linear DNA fragments (exogenotes). Without RecA, they cannot be integrated into the host chromosome.\n    *   **Degradation of DNA:** Linear DNA is highly susceptible to degradation by cellular nucleases. The problem states that the RecBCD enzyme is functional. The RecBCD complex is a potent exonuclease that will recognize the ends of the linear donor fragment and rapidly degrade it.\n    *   **Lack of Stable Inheritance:** Because the donor fragment cannot be integrated and is destined for degradation, it cannot be replicated along with the recipient's chromosome. Any transient expression of the donor genes will be lost upon the first few cell divisions. This transient state is known as abortive conjugation. The cell is a merozygote, but not a stable recombinant.\n    *   **Inability to Form Colonies:** A cell that cannot stably maintain and express the selected marker (e.g., $\\mathrm{thr}^{+}$) cannot undergo sustained growth and division on the selective medium. It will fail to form a \"stable, full-sized colony\". At best, it might form a micro-colony of a few cells before the donor DNA is lost, but such colonies are explicitly excluded by the stated scoring criterion.\n\n5.  **Conclusion for the Experiment:**\n    *   **Maximal Recombinant Frequencies:** Since no stable recombinants can be formed for any marker due to the lack of RecA-mediated integration, the number of full-sized colonies counted on the selective plates at any time point will be essentially zero (or reduced to the background level of spontaneous reversion, which is negligible in this context). Therefore, the maximal recombinant frequencies for $\\mathrm{thr}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{leu}^{+}$, and $\\mathrm{gal}^{+}$ will all collapse to approximately $0\\%$.\n    *   **Apparent Entry Times:** The \"apparent time-of-entry\" is operationally defined as the earliest time point at which stable recombinant colonies are detected above background. Since no such colonies will be detected at *any* time point, it becomes impossible to measure a time of entry. The concept is not applicable under these experimental conditions.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Apparent entry times will shift earlier by a constant offset because recombination lag is eliminated, while maximal recombinant frequencies will remain approximately the same as in recA$^{+}$.**\n    *   This is incorrect. The absence of RecA prevents recombination, it does not accelerate it. The maximal frequencies will not remain the same; they will drop to zero. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B. Apparent entry times will not be determinable under the stated scoring conditions, and maximal recombinant frequencies for all markers will collapse to approximately $0$.**\n    *   This is correct. As derived above, the inability to form stable recombinants means that no full-sized colonies will form. Consequently, frequencies drop to $0$ and entry times cannot be determined. **Correct.**\n\n*   **C. Apparent entry times will be unchanged, but maximal recombinant frequencies will be reduced only for late-entering markers because transferred DNA is preferentially degraded at later times.**\n    *   This is incorrect. The lack of recombination is absolute and affects all markers, not just late-entering ones. The concept of an \"unchanged\" entry time is flawed because entry times will be non-determinable. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Apparent entry times will be uniformly delayed because recombination proceeds more slowly without RecA, and maximal recombinant frequencies will decline modestly (to roughly $50\\%$ of recA$^{+}$ levels) due to alternative pathways.**\n    *   This is incorrect. Recombination does not proceed \"more slowly\"; it is effectively eliminated. While minor, alternative recombination pathways exist in certain exotic genetic backgrounds, they are not a feature of a standard `recA` null mutant and would not yield frequencies anywhere near $50\\%$ of the wild-type level. Entry times are not delayed; they are non-determinable. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. Early-entering markers will retain near-normal apparent entry times and near-normal maximal frequencies via abortive transconjugants, whereas late-entering markers will fail to appear.**\n    *   This is incorrect. It misinterprets \"abortive transconjugants\" as stable recombinants. Abortive events by definition do not lead to stable, full-sized colonies, which are the only outcome being scored. The effect of the `recA-` mutation is global and does not spare early-entering markers. **Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2824311"}, {"introduction": "Genetic outcomes at the population level are often governed by a combination of deterministic kinetics and stochastic events.

A solution will be provided.\n\nLet $E$ be the event that a recipient becomes $A^{+}$. The donor is selected from a mixed pool, so we apply the law of total probability, conditioned on the donor type being Hfr$_{1}$, Hfr$_{2}$, or F$^{+}$.\n$$P(E) = P(E | \\text{Hfr}_{1}) P(\\text{Hfr}_{1}) + P(E | \\text{Hfr}_{2}) P(\\text{Hfr}_{2}) + P(E | \\text{F}^{+}) P(\\text{F}^{+})$$\nThe probabilities of selecting each donor type are given as $p_{1} = 0.5$, $p_{2} = 0.3$, and $p_{3} = 0.2$.\nThe problem states that F$^{+}$ donors do not transfer chromosomal DNA. Therefore, the probability of acquiring the $A^{+}$ allele from an F$^{+}$ donor is zero:\n$$P(E | \\text{F}^{+}) = 0$$\nNow, we must compute the conditional probability $P(E | \\text{Hfr}_{i})$ for a generic Hfr strain with distance $d_{i}$ to the $A^{+}$ locus. For the recipient to become $A^{+}$, two conditions must be met:\n1. The DNA transfer must proceed at least to the $A^{+}$ locus. The time required to transfer a segment of length $d_{i}$ is $t_{i} = \\frac{d_{i}}{v}$. Transfer must continue for at least this duration, so $T \\ge t_{i}$.\n2. A double crossover must flank the $A^{+}$ locus. This requires at least one crossover in the chromosomal segment from the origin of transfer to the $A^{+}$ locus (length $d_{i}$), and at least one crossover in the segment from the $A^{+}$ locus to the end of the transferred fragment (length $vT - d_{i}$).\n\nLet us formalize this. The integration of the $A^{+}$ allele occurs if $T \\ge t_{i}$ and there is at least one crossover in the interval of length $d_{i}$ and at least one in the interval of length $vT - d_{i}$.\nThe number of crossovers, $N$, in a fragment of length $L$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\rho L$. The probability of at least one crossover is $1 - P(N=0) = 1 - \\exp(-\\rho L)$.\n\nThe event of at least one crossover in the first segment (length $d_{i}$) is independent of the transfer time $T$. Its probability is $P_{cr,1} = 1 - \\exp(-\\rho d_{i})$.\nThe event of at least one crossover in the second segment (length $vT - d_{i}$) depends on the random variable $T$. Its conditional probability given $T=t$ (for $t \\ge t_{i}$) is $P_{cr,2}(t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\rho(vt - d_{i}))$.\n\nThe probability of successful transfer from an Hfr$_{i}$ donor is found by integrating over all possible termination times $t \\ge t_{i}$:\n$$P(E | \\text{Hfr}_{i}) = \\int_{t_{i}}^{\\infty} P(\\text{success} | T=t) f_{T}(t) dt$$\nwhere $f_{T}(t) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda t)$ is the probability density function of the exponential distribution for $T$. The probability of success at a given time $t \\ge t_{i}$ is the product of the probabilities of the independent crossover events:\n$$P(\\text{success} | T=t) = (1 - \\exp(-\\rho d_{i})) (1 - \\exp(-\\rho(vt - d_{i})))$$\nThe integral for $P(E | \\text{Hfr}_{i})$ is thus:\n$$P(E | \\text{Hfr}_{i}) = \\int_{d_{i}/v}^{\\infty} (1 - \\exp(-\\rho d_{i})) (1 - \\exp(-\\rho(vt - d_{i}))) \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda t) dt$$\nThe term $(1 - \\exp(-\\rho d_{i}))$ is a constant with respect to the integration variable $t$.\n$$P(E | \\text{Hfr}_{i}) = (1 - \\exp(-\\rho d_{i})) \\lambda \\int_{d_{i}/v}^{\\infty} (1 - \\exp(-\\rho(vt - d_{i}))) \\exp(-\\lambda t) dt$$\nLet $t_{i} = d_{i}/v$.

The expression simplifies to:\n$$ = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\exp(-\\lambda t_{i}) - \\frac{\\exp(\\rho d_{i})}{\\lambda + \\rho v} \\exp(-\\lambda t_{i} - \\rho d_{i}) = \\exp(-\\lambda t_{i}) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda + \\rho v}\\right) $$\n$$ = \\exp(-\\lambda t_{i}) \\left(\\frac{\\lambda + \\rho v - \\lambda}{\\lambda(\\lambda + \\rho v)}\\right) = \\frac{\\rho v}{\\lambda(\\lambda + \\rho v)} \\exp(-\\lambda t_{i}) $$\nMultiplying by the pre-factors $\\lambda(1 - \\exp(-\\rho d_{i}))$:\n$$P(E | \\text{Hfr}_{i}) = (1 - \\exp(-\\rho d_{i})) \\frac{\\rho v}{\\lambda + \\rho v} \\exp(-\\lambda \\frac{d_{i}}{v})$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$\\lambda = 0.1 \\text{ min}^{-1}$, $v = 40 \\text{ kb} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1}$, $\\rho = 0.005 \\text{ kb}^{-1}$.\nThe product $\\rho v = (0.005)(40) = 0.2 \\text{ min}^{-1}$.\nThe term $\\frac{\\rho v}{\\lambda + \\rho v} = \\frac{0.2}{0.1 + 0.2} = \\frac{0.2}{0.3} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nFor Hfr$_{1}$: $d_{1} = 400$ kb.\n- The exponent for the first crossover probability is $-\\rho d_{1} = -0.005 \\times 400 = -2$.\n- The exponent for the transfer probability is $-\\frac{\\lambda d_{1}}{v} = -\\frac{0.1 \\times 400}{40} = -1$.\n$$P(E | \\text{Hfr}_{1}) = (1 - \\exp(-2)) \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) \\exp(-1)$$\n\nFor Hfr$_{2}$: $d_{2} = 3600$ kb.\n- The exponent for the first crossover probability is $-\\rho d_{2} = -0.005 \\times 3600 = -18$.\n- The exponent for the transfer probability is $-\\frac{\\lambda d_{2}}{v} = -\\frac{0.1 \\times 3600}{40} = -9$.\n$$P(E | \\text{Hfr}_{2}) = (1 - \\exp(-18)) \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) \\exp(-9)$$\n\nNow, we compute the total probability $P(E)$:\n$$P(E) = P(E | \\text{Hfr}_{1}) p_{1} + P(E | \\text{Hfr}_{2}) p_{2} + P(E | \\text{F}^{+}) p_{3}$$\n$$P(E) = \\left[(1 - \\exp(-2)) \\frac{2}{3} \\exp(-1)\\right](0.5) + \\left[(1 - \\exp(-18)) \\frac{2}{3} \\exp(-9)\\right](0.3) + (0)(0.2)$$\n$$P(E) = (1 - \\exp(-2)) \\frac{1}{3} \\exp(-1) + (1 - \\exp(-18)) (0.2) \\exp(-9)$$\nUsing numerical values:\n$\\exp(-1) \\approx 0.367879$\n$\\exp(-2) \\approx 0.135335$\n$\\exp(-9) \\approx 1.2341 \\times 10^{-4}$\n$\\exp(-18)$ is negligible, so $1 - \\exp(-18) \\approx 1$.\n$$P(E) \\approx (1 - 0.135335) \\frac{1}{3} (0.367879) + (1) (0.2) (1.2341 \\times 10^{-4})$$\n$$P(E) \\approx (0.864665) (0.122626) + 0.000024682$$\n$$P(E) \\approx 0.106031 + 0.000024682 = 0.106055682$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.1061$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1061}$$", "id": "2791323"}]}
