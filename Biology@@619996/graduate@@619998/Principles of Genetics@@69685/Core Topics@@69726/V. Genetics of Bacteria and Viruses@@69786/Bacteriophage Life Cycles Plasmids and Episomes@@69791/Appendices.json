By applying principles of Poisson statistics, you will also learn to quantify the uncertainty in your estimate of the burst size, a crucial skill in quantitative biology [@problem_id:2791855].", "problem": "A classic one-step growth experiment is performed with a lytic bacteriophage infecting a homogeneous culture of bacterial hosts under conditions of synchronous infection and immediate adsorption at time zero. The resulting one-step growth curve shows the onset of the rise at time $18$ minutes and a plateau at time $30$ minutes. At the plateau, plaque-forming units (PFU) counted from the culture total $5 \\times 10^{8}$, and the number of infected cells at the outset of the experiment is known exactly to be $10^{7}$. Assume that each infected cell ultimately lyses by the time the plateau is reached.\n\nUsing the foundational definitions that in a one-step growth curve the latent period is the time from infection to the first detectable release of progeny phage, and that the average burst size is the ratio of total infectious progeny to the number of infected cells, and using the well-established property that PFU counts under replicate plating can be modeled as Poisson-distributed random variables, answer the following:\n\n1) Determine the latent period in minutes.\n\n2) Determine the average burst size as a dimensionless quantity.\n\n3) Under the assumption that the PFU count is a single Poisson-distributed observation with mean equal to its variance, and treating the number of infected cells as known without error, estimate the Standard Error (SE) of the burst size estimate.\n\nRound all three requested quantities to three significant figures.

It presents a standard problem in quantitative virology based on the classical one-step growth experiment. All necessary definitions, data, and assumptions are provided and are internally consistent. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the determination of three quantities: the latent period, the average burst size, and the standard error of the burst size estimate.\n\n1) Determination of the Latent Period\nThe problem defines the latent period as \"the time from infection to the first detectable release of progeny phage\". In the context of a one-step growth curve, this period begins at the time of infection, which is given as time zero ($t=0$), and ends at the \"onset of the rise\" of the phage titer. The problem explicitly states that the onset of the rise occurs at $18$ minutes. Therefore, the latent period, which we shall denote as $L_p$, is directly given by this value.\n$$L_p = 18 \\text{ minutes}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we express this as $18.0$ minutes.\n\n2) Determination of the Average Burst Size\nThe problem defines the average burst size ($BS$) as \"the ratio of total infectious progeny to the number of infected cells\". The total infectious progeny is the final yield of phage particles, which is measured by the plaque-forming units (PFU) at the plateau of the growth curve. The number of infected cells is the initial count of bacteria that were successfully infected.\n\nLet $N_{PFU}$ be the total PFU count at the plateau and $N_{cells}$ be the initial number of infected cells. The given values are:\n$$N_{PFU} = 5 \\times 10^{8}$$\n$$N_{cells} = 10^{7}$$\nThe average burst size is then calculated as:\n$$BS = \\frac{N_{PFU}}{N_{cells}} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^{8}}{10^{7}} = 5 \\times 10^{(8-7)} = 5 \\times 10^{1} = 50$$\nThis is a dimensionless quantity representing the average number of phages produced per lysed cell. Rounding to three significant figures, the burst size is $50.0$.\n\n3) Estimation of the Standard Error (SE) of the Burst Size\nThe burst size, $BS$, is an estimate calculated from experimental data. We must now quantify the statistical uncertainty of this estimate. The burst size is a function of two quantities: the PFU count, which we will denote as a random variable $Y$, and the number of infected cells, $N$.\n$$BS = \\frac{Y}{N}$$\nThe problem states that the PFU count $Y$ can be modeled as a Poisson-distributed random variable. A fundamental property of a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$ is that its variance is also equal to its mean:\n$$Y \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)$$\n$$E[Y] = \\lambda$$\n$$Var(Y) = \\lambda$$\nThe observed PFU count, $Y_{obs} = N_{PFU} = 5 \\times 10^{8}$, is our single best estimate for the mean $\\lambda$. Therefore, the best estimate for the variance of the PFU count is the count itself:\n$$\\widehat{Var}(Y) = Y_{obs} = 5 \\times 10^{8}$$\nThe problem also specifies that the number of infected cells, $N = N_{cells} = 10^{7}$, is known \"without error\", meaning it is treated as a deterministic constant, not a random variable.\n\nWe use the principle of propagation of uncertainty to find the variance of the burst size estimate, $Var(BS)$. For a function $f(X) = aX$, where $a$ is a constant, the variance is $Var(aX) = a^2 Var(X)$. In our case, $BS = \\frac{1}{N} \\cdot Y$, so the constant is $a = \\frac{1}{N}$.\n$$Var(BS) = Var\\left(\\frac{1}{N} Y\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right)^2 Var(Y) = \\frac{Var(Y)}{N^2}$$\nThe Standard Error ($SE$) of the burst size estimate is the standard deviation of its sampling distribution, which is the square root of its variance:\n$$SE(BS) = \\sqrt{Var(BS)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{Var(Y)}{N^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{Var(Y)}}{N}$$\nSubstituting our estimated variance for $Y$:\n$$\\widehat{SE}(BS) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\widehat{Var}(Y)}}{N} = \\frac{\\sqrt{Y_{obs}}}{N}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$$\\widehat{SE}(BS) = \\frac{\\sqrt{5 \\times 10^{8}}}{10^{7}}$$\nTo compute this, we simplify the expression:\n$$\\widehat{SE}(BS) = \\frac{\\sqrt{5} \\times \\sqrt{10^{8}}}{10^{7}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5} \\times 10^{4}}{10^{7}} = \\sqrt{5} \\times 10^{(4-7)} = \\sqrt{5} \\times 10^{-3}$$\nUsing the numerical value $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.2360679...$:\n$$\\widehat{SE}(BS) \\approx 2.2360679 \\times 10^{-3} \\approx 0.0022360679$$\nRounding this result to three significant figures, we look at the first three non-zero digits ($2$, $2$, $3$) and the fourth digit ($6$). Since the fourth digit is $5$ or greater, we round up the third digit.\n$$\\widehat{SE}(BS) \\approx 0.00224$$\nThe three requested quantities, rounded to three significant figures, are:\n- Latent period: $18.0$ minutes\n- Average burst size: $50.0$\n- Standard Error of burst size: $0.00224$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 18.0 & 50.0 & 0.00224 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2791855"}, {"introduction": "While bacteriophages have their own replication and transmission strategies, plasmids rely on the host cell's division for their propagation, making their stable inheritance a critical challenge.

Assume the following mechanistic rules grounded in standard plasmid genetics and probability:\n- When the partitioning system functions (with probability $1 - p_f$), it places plasmid copies so that each daughter receives at least one copy (no segregational loss on that division).\n- When the partitioning system fails (with probability $p_f$), each of the $n$ plasmid copies independently segregates to either daughter with equal probability $1/2$ (binomial segregation without bias or interference).\n\nDefine the segregational loss rate per generation, $L(n,p_f)$, as the probability that a randomly chosen daughter cell is plasmid-free immediately after a division.\n\nUsing only the above definitions and the basic properties of the binomial distribution and conditional probability, derive a closed-form analytic expression for $L(n,p_f)$, and then derive the fold-change in $L$ when the copy number is doubled to $2n$ with $p_f$ held fixed; that is, compute $F(n) = \\dfrac{L(2n,p_f)}{L(n,p_f)}$.\n\nReport your final answer as a row vector containing $L(n,p_f)$ and $F(n)$ in that order.

This quantity is defined as the probability that a randomly chosen daughter cell is plasmid-free. Due to the symmetry of the segregation process, this is equivalent to the probability that any specific daughter cell (let us call it Daughter A) is plasmid-free. Let $E_A$ be the event that Daughter A is plasmid-free. Thus, $L(n,p_f) = P(E_A)$.\n\nThe process of plasmid segregation is determined by whether the active partitioning system functions or fails. Let $S$ be the event that the system functions correctly, and $F$ be the event that it fails. The problem provides the probabilities for these events:\n$$P(S) = 1 - p_f$$\n$$P(F) = p_f$$\nSince events $S$ and $F$ are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, the Law of Total Probability can be applied to find the probability of event $E_A$:\n$$L(n,p_f) = P(E_A) = P(E_A|S)P(S) + P(E_A|F)P(F)$$\nNext, I will determine the conditional probabilities $P(E_A|S)$ and $P(E_A|F)$ based on the rules provided.\n\nThe first conditional probability, $P(E_A|S)$, is the probability that Daughter A is plasmid-free given that the partitioning system functions. The problem states that when the system functions, \"it places plasmid copies so that each daughter receives at least one copy\". This directly implies that no daughter cell can be plasmid-free. Thus, the event $E_A$ is impossible under condition $S$:\n$$P(E_A|S) = 0$$\nThe second conditional probability, $P(E_A|F)$, is the probability that Daughter A is plasmid-free given that the partitioning system fails. In this scenario, \"each of the $n$ plasmid copies independently segregates to either daughter with equal probability $1/2$\". For Daughter A to be plasmid-free, all $n$ plasmid copies must segregate to the other cell, Daughter B. The probability for any single plasmid to segregate to Daughter B is $1/2$. Because the segregation of each plasmid is an independent event, the probability that all $n$ plasmids segregate to Daughter B is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(E_A|F) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\dots \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\text{ ($n$ times)} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n = \\frac{1}{2^n}$$\nNow, I will substitute the conditional probabilities back into the expression for $L(n,p_f)$:\n$$L(n,p_f) = (0) \\cdot (1 - p_f) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2^n}\\right) \\cdot p_f$$\nThis simplifies to the closed-form expression for the segregational loss rate:\n$$L(n,p_f) = \\frac{p_f}{2^n}$$\nThe second part of the problem is to derive the fold-change $F(n) = \\dfrac{L(2n,p_f)}{L(n,p_f)}$.\nUsing the expression for $L(n,p_f)$ derived above, we can write the corresponding expression for a plasmid copy number of $2n$ by substituting $n$ with $2n$:\n$$L(2n,p_f) = \\frac{p_f}{2^{2n}}$$\nNow, I will compute the ratio defining $F(n)$.
