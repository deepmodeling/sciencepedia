A primary barrier is the Restriction-Modification (R-M) system, which degrades foreign DNA. This problem [@problem_id:2020025] challenges you to model the fate of a plasmid entering a cell expressing an R-M system, viewing it as a kinetic race between restriction (cleavage) and methylation (protection) at each recognition site. By deriving the survival probability, you will apply principles of chemical kinetics to a core problem in genetic engineering, gaining insight into the molecular hurdles of inter-species DNA transfer.", "problem": "In a synthetic biology project, a researcher engineers a strain of *Escherichia coli* (*E. coli*) to express a heterologous Type II Restriction-Modification (R-M) system. This system consists of two enzymes: a restriction endonuclease that cleaves DNA at a specific recognition sequence, and a methyltransferase that adds a methyl group to a base within the same sequence, thereby protecting it from cleavage.\n\nA circular plasmid, carrying a gene of interest, is to be introduced into this engineered *E. coli* strain via transformation. This plasmid was isolated from a different organism and is therefore completely unmethylated with respect to the engineered R-M system. The plasmid contains exactly $N$ distinct, non-overlapping recognition sites for the R-M system's endonuclease and methyltransferase.\n\nOnce the plasmid enters the cytoplasm, it becomes a substrate for both enzymes simultaneously. At any given unmethylated recognition site, the process of restriction (cleavage) can be modeled as a pseudo-first-order reaction with a rate constant $k_{res}$. Similarly, the process of methylation at that same site can be modeled as a pseudo-first-order reaction with a rate constant $k_{met}$. If a site is methylated, it is permanently protected from restriction. If a site is restricted, the plasmid is linearized and considered non-functional, leading to a failed transformation.\n\nAssuming the enzymatic events at each of the $N$ recognition sites are independent, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the probability, $P_{success}$, that a single plasmid molecule will survive the R-M system and lead to a successful transformation. Your expression should be in terms of $N$, $k_{met}$, and $k_{res}$.", "solution": "We model each recognition site as having two independent pseudo-first-order processes acting on it: methylation with rate constant $k_{met}$ and restriction with rate constant $k_{res}$.

The probability of this event is the probability that $T_{met} < T_{res}$.

In natural transformation, bacteria take up DNA from their environment and may incorporate it into their genome. This advanced exercise [@problem_id:2791486] invites you to develop a mathematical model for the probability of co-transformation—the event where two nearby genetic markers are incorporated together on a single fragment of donor DNA. By modeling the recombination tract length with a geometric distribution and applying principles of conditional probability, you will derive a foundational equation in bacterial genetics that links physical distance on a chromosome to genetic linkage.", "problem": "In natural bacterial transformation, a recipient cell integrates a contiguous donor DNA segment (a single homologous recombination tract) into its chromosome. Consider two chromosomal sites, a selected site $A$ and an unselected site $B$ located $d$ base pairs to the right of $A$ on the recipient genome. A co-transformation event for $B$ occurs if both $A$ and $B$ are contained within the same imported donor tract.\n\nAssume the following mechanistic model:\n\n- Each transformation event imports a contiguous tract of length $L \\in \\{1,2,3,\\ldots\\}$ base pairs, where $L$ has a geometric distribution with parameter $p \\in (0,1)$, that is $\\mathbb{P}(L=\\ell)=p(1-p)^{\\ell-1}$ for all integer $\\ell \\geq 1$.\n- Conditional on being included within a tract of length $L$, the position of site $A$ is equally likely to be any of the $L$ base-pair positions along the tract. Equivalently, selection for $A$ induces length-biased sampling of tracts (longer tracts are proportionally more likely to include $A$).\n- Given a tract of length $L$ that includes $A$, define the residual rightward coverage $R$ as the number of base pairs to the right of the position of $A$ within the tract up to the tract’s right end. Conditional on $L$, $R$ is uniformly distributed over $\\{0,1,\\ldots,L-1\\}$.\n\nStarting from these assumptions and only basic definitions of conditional probability and the geometric distribution, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the expected co-transformation probability that $B$ is co-transformed with $A$ as a function of $p$ and $d$. Your final answer must be a single simplified expression. No numerical approximation is required, and no units are needed.", "solution": "The problem is to calculate the probability that site $B$ is co-transformed with site $A$. Let $A$ be at position $x_A$. Site $B$ is at position $x_A+d$. A tract that covers site $A$ is selected. For co-transformation of $B$ to occur, this tract must also cover site $B$. This requires the tract to extend at least $d$ base pairs to the right of site $A$. Let $R$ be the random variable representing the residual rightward coverage from site $A$. The co-transformation probability is precisely $\\mathbb{P}(R \\ge d)$. To calculate this, we must first find the probability mass function (PMF) of $R$.\n\nThe PMF of $R$ can be found using the law of total probability, conditioned on the length of the tract that contains $A$. Let this length be the random variable $L_A$.\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(R=r) = \\sum_{\\ell=1}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{P}(R=r | L_A=\\ell) \\mathbb{P}(L_A=\\ell) $$\n\nFirst, we derive the PMF of $L_A$. The problem states that selection for $A$ induces length-biased sampling. If $L$ is the length of a random tract from the environment with PMF $\\mathbb{P}(L=\\ell)$ and mean $\\mathbb{E}[L]$, the length $L_A$ of a tract selected because it contains $A$ has the PMF:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(L_A=\\ell) = \\frac{\\ell \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(L=\\ell)}{\\mathbb{E}[L]} $$\nThe initial distribution of tract length $L$ is geometric: $\\mathbb{P}(L=\\ell) = p(1-p)^{\\ell-1}$ for $\\ell \\ge 1$. The expected value of this distribution is $\\mathbb{E}[L] = \\frac{1}{p}$.\nSubstituting these into the formula for the length-biased distribution gives the PMF of $L_A$:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(L_A=\\ell) = p^2 \\ell (1-p)^{\\ell-1} \\quad \\text{for } \\ell=1, 2, \\ldots $$\n\nNext, we use the given conditional distribution of $R$. Given a tract of length $L_A = \\ell$ containing $A$, the residual rightward coverage $R$ is uniformly distributed over $\\{0, 1, \\ldots, \\ell-1\\}$.\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(R=r | L_A=\\ell) = \\frac{1}{\\ell} \\quad \\text{for } r \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, \\ell-1\\} $$\nand $\\mathbb{P}(R=r | L_A=\\ell) = 0$ if $r \\ge \\ell$.\n\nNow, we compute the unconditional PMF of $R$. The sum over $\\ell$ must start from $r+1$, since for a given $r$, we must have $\\ell-1 \\ge r$, or $\\ell \\ge r+1$.\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(R=r) = \\sum_{\\ell=r+1}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{P}(R=r | L_A=\\ell) \\mathbb{P}(L_A=\\ell) $$\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(R=r) = \\sum_{\\ell=r+1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\ell} \\right) \\left( p^2 \\ell (1-p)^{\\ell-1} \\right) $$\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(R=r) = p^2 \\sum_{\\ell=r+1}^{\\infty} (1-p)^{\\ell-1} $$\nThis is a geometric series.

This result shows that the residual coverage $R$ follows a geometric distribution on the non-negative integers. This is a classic result from renewal theory (the inspection paradox), where the remaining lifetime of a component (here, the remaining tract length) follows the original lifetime distribution.\n\nFinally, we calculate the co-transformation probability, which is $\\mathbb{P}(R \\ge d)$.
