The time of first appearance of a marker in the exconjugant population is, under standard assumptions, proportional to the distance from oriT to that marker along the direction of transfer.

The model of a circular bacterial chromosome with a map length of $100$ minutes is the standard convention for *Escherichia coli*. The assumptions of constant transfer rate and the direct proportionality between entry time and map distance are the fundamental, albeit simplified, principles upon which this experimental technique is based. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary data and definitions to arrive at a unique solution. The given times ($t_A, t_B, t_C$), the total map length ($100$ minutes), and the definition of the angular coordinate system are sufficient and unambiguous.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective scientific language, free of any subjective or speculative content.\n\nThe verdict is that the problem is **valid**. It is a well-posed, standard exercise in quantitative genetics. Proceeding to solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle of this Hfr mapping experiment is that the time of entry of a gene into the recipient cell is a direct measure of its linear distance from the origin of transfer, oriT. The problem states that this distance, measured in \"minutes,\" is numerically equal to the entry time in minutes.\n\nThe positions of the markers $A$, $B$, and $C$ relative to oriT (which is at position $0$) are therefore given by their respective entry times:\n- Position of marker $A$: $p_A = t_A = 10$ minutes.\n- Position of marker $B$: $p_B = t_B = 18$ minutes.\n- Position of marker $C$: $p_C = t_C = 31$ minutes.\n\nThe order of the genes along the chromosome in the direction of transfer is oriT - $A$ - $B$ - $C$.\n\nThe pairwise map distances along this transfer path are calculated by the difference in their entry times:\n- Distance between $A$ and $B$: $d_{AB} = t_B - t_A = 18 - 10 = 8$ minutes.\n- Distance between $B$ and $C$: $d_{BC} = t_C - t_B = 31 - 18 = 13$ minutes.\n\nThe problem requires a conversion from the linear map, measured in minutes, to an angular coordinate system, measured in radians. The total circumference of the circular chromosome is given as $L = 100$ minutes. A full circle corresponds to a total angle of $2\\pi$ radians.\n\nWe can define a conversion factor, $k$, to map a linear position $p$ (in minutes) to an angular coordinate $\\theta$ (in radians).\n$$k = \\frac{\\text{Total Angle}}{\\text{Total Length}} = \\frac{2\\pi \\text{ radians}}{100 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{\\pi}{50} \\frac{\\text{rad}}{\\text{min}}$$\nThe angular coordinate $\\theta(p)$ for a marker at position $p$ from oriT is thus:\n$$\\theta(p) = k \\times p = \\frac{\\pi p}{50}$$\nThe problem states that oriT is at angular coordinate $0$, which is consistent with this formulation for $p=0$.\n\nUsing this conversion, we find the angular positions of markers $A$ and $B$:\n- Angular position of $A$: $\\theta_A = \\theta(p_A) = \\frac{\\pi \\times t_A}{50} = \\frac{\\pi \\times 10}{50} = \\frac{\\pi}{5}$ radians.\n- Angular position of $B$: $\\theta_B = \\theta(p_B) = \\frac{\\pi \\times t_B}{50} = \\frac{\\pi \\times 18}{50} = \\frac{9\\pi}{25}$ radians.\n\nThe question asks for the angular coordinate of the midpoint of the arc from $A$ to $B$ *along the transfer direction*. This is the arithmetic mean of the angular coordinates of $A$ and $B$. Let this midpoint be $\\theta_M$.\n$$\\theta_M = \\frac{\\theta_A + \\theta_B}{2}$$\nSubstitute the calculated angular positions:\n$$\\theta_M = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{5} + \\frac{9\\pi}{25} \\right)$$\nTo add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $25$.\n$$\\frac{\\pi}{5} = \\frac{5\\pi}{25}$$\nSo, the expression becomes:\n$$\\theta_M = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{5\\pi}{25} + \\frac{9\\pi}{25} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{5\\pi + 9\\pi}{25} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{14\\pi}{25} \\right)$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the final result:\n$$\\theta_M = \\frac{7\\pi}{25}$$\nThis is the exact angular coordinate of the specified midpoint in radians.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{7\\pi}{25}} $$", "id": "2824326"}, {"introduction": "A successful mapping experiment depends entirely on the ability to isolate rare recombinant cells from the vast excess of parental cells, demanding a carefully designed plating strategy that uses both selection and counter-selection.

No flaws are identified.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe problem requires the design of a selective plating strategy to isolate a specific class of bacterial cells after a conjugation experiment. The strategy must satisfy two criteria:\n1.  **Selection:** It must permit the growth of only those cells that have acquired the desired trait, in this case the $\\mathrm{met}^{+}$ allele from the donor.\n2.  **Counter-selection:** It must prevent the growth of the unwanted parental Hfr donor cells.\n\nLet us analyze the genotypes of the cell populations present after mating is interrupted:\n-   **Unmated Hfr Donors:** Hfr, $\\mathrm{met}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{thr}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{str}^{S}$.\n-   **Unmated F⁻ Recipients:** $\\mathrm{F}^{-}$, $\\mathrm{met}^{-}$, $\\mathrm{thr}^{-}$, $\\mathrm{str}^{R}$.\n-   **Recombinant F⁻ Exconjugants:** $\\mathrm{F}^{-}$, $\\mathrm{met}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{thr}^{\\pm}$ (depending on transfer time), $\\mathrm{str}^{R}$. These are the target cells. The $\\mathrm{str}^{R}$ gene is on the recipient chromosome and is not transferred from the Hfr donor. Hence, all exconjugants, being derived from the $\\mathrm{F}^{-}$ recipient, will be $\\mathrm{str}^{R}$. The problem specifies we are interested in recombinants that inherited at least the $\\mathrm{met}^{+}$ allele.\n\nTo satisfy the **selection** criterion (recovering $\\mathrm{met}^{+}$ recombinants), one must create an environment where cells with the $\\mathrm{met}^{-}$ genotype cannot proliferate. A cell that is auxotrophic for methionine ($\\mathrm{met}^{-}$) cannot synthesize this amino acid and requires it to be supplied in the growth medium. Conversely, a prototrophic cell ($\\mathrm{met}^{+}$) can synthesize its own methionine. Therefore, plating the mixture on a minimal medium that *lacks* methionine will select for cells with the $\\mathrm{met}^{+}$ phenotype. On such a medium, the original $\\mathrm{met}^{-}$ recipient cells will fail to grow, while the $\\mathrm{met}^{+}$ Hfr donors and the desired $\\mathrm{met}^{+}$ exconjugants will be able to grow.\n\nTo satisfy the **counter-selection** criterion (eliminating Hfr donors), one must exploit a differential trait between the donors and the recipients/exconjugants. The donor is streptomycin sensitive ($\\mathrm{str}^{S}$), while the recipient is streptomycin resistant ($\\mathrm{str}^{R}$). Incorporating streptomycin into the plating medium at an inhibitory concentration will kill the $\\mathrm{str}^{S}$ donor cells, while allowing the $\\mathrm{str}^{R}$ recipient and exconjugant cells to survive.\n\nTo achieve both goals simultaneously, the plating medium must combine these two features. It must be a minimal medium that both lacks methionine and contains streptomycin. On such a medium, growth requires a cell to be both prototrophic for methionine ($\\mathrm{met}^{+}$) and resistant to streptomycin ($\\mathrm{str}^{R}$).\n-   Original Hfr donors ($\\mathrm{met}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{str}^{S}$) are killed by streptomycin.\n-   Original F⁻ recipients ($\\mathrm{met}^{-}$, $\\mathrm{str}^{R}$) cannot grow due to the lack of methionine.\n-   Only the recombinant exconjugants ($\\mathrm{met}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{str}^{R}$) possess the combination of traits necessary for survival and proliferation.\n\nThis analysis establishes the required composition of the plating medium. Now, we evaluate the provided options.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Plate on minimal medium lacking methionine and containing streptomycin at an inhibitory concentration for $\\mathrm{str}^{S}$ cells.**\n-   The minimal medium lacking methionine selects for the $\\mathrm{met}^{+}$ phenotype. This correctly allows growth of the desired recombinants but prevents growth of the non-recombinant $\\mathrm{F}^{-}$ recipients.\n-   The presence of streptomycin counter-selects against the $\\mathrm{str}^{S}$ Hfr donors, killing them.\n-   The combination of these two conditions permits growth only of cells that are $\\mathrm{met}^{+}$ AND $\\mathrm{str}^{R}$, which are precisely the target recombinant exconjugants.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Plate on minimal medium lacking methionine without any antibiotic.**\n-   The minimal medium lacking methionine selects for the $\\mathrm{met}^{+}$ phenotype. This allows both Hfr donors and $\\mathrm{met}^{+}$ recombinants to grow.\n-   The absence of antibiotic means there is no counter-selection against the Hfr donor cells.\n-   The resulting plate would contain a mixture of Hfr donor colonies and recombinant colonies, failing the secondary objective of eliminating the donors.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Plate on rich medium (e.g., Luria–Bertani) containing streptomycin at an inhibitory concentration for $\\mathrm{str}^{S}$ cells.**\n-   Rich medium contains all amino acids, including methionine. Therefore, it does not select for the $\\mathrm{met}^{+}$ phenotype. Both $\\mathrm{met}^{-}$ and $\\mathrm{met}^{+}$ cells can grow.\n-   The presence of streptomycin will eliminate the Hfr donors.\n-   However, because there is no nutritional selection, the plate would be overgrown with the vast population of non-recombinant $\\mathrm{F}^{-}$ recipient cells ($\\mathrm{met}^{-}$, $\\mathrm{str}^{R}$), making it impossible to isolate the much rarer recombinant colonies. This fails the primary objective.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Plate on minimal medium supplemented with methionine and containing streptomycin at an inhibitory concentration for $\\mathrm{str}^{S}$ cells.**\n-   This medium is functionally equivalent to the rich medium in option C with respect to methionine. By supplementing with methionine, the selection for the $\\mathrm{met}^{+}$ allele is nullified. Both $\\mathrm{met}^{-}$ and $\\mathrm{met}^{+}$ cells can grow.\n-   The presence of streptomycin will eliminate the Hfr donors.\n-   As with option C, the non-recombinant $\\mathrm{F}^{-}$ recipients ($\\mathrm{met}^{-}$, $\\mathrm{str}^{R}$) would survive and proliferate, obscuring any recombinants.

The problem is well-posed, as the inclusion of multiple shared markers ($azi$, $leu$, $pro$) and the definition of a reference point ($oriT_A$ at $0$) provide sufficient constraints to determine a unique solution. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or missing information. All data points are consistent with a single circular map, as will be demonstrated in the solution.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A formal solution follows.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe core principle is that the time of marker entry, $t$, is equivalent to the distance along the chromosome from the strain's origin of transfer, $oriT$, in the specified direction of transfer. Let $C(X)$ denote the global clockwise coordinate of a marker $X$ on the $0$ to $100$ minute map.\n\n1.  **Establish the Global Map using Hfr$_A$**\n    The origin $oriT_A$ is defined to be at the global coordinate $C(oriT_A) = 0$. Hfr$_A$ transfers its chromosome in the clockwise (CW) direction. Therefore, for any marker transferred by Hfr$_A$, its global clockwise coordinate is simply its time of entry.\n    -   $C(azi) = 12$\n    -   $C(leu) = 18$\n    -   $C(lac) = 43$\n    -   $C(gal) = 55$\n    -   $C(his) = 70$\n    -   $C(pro) = 86$\n\n2.  **Determine the Location of $oriT_B$**\n    The Hfr$_B$ strain transfers in the counterclockwise (CCW) direction. The time of entry for a marker from Hfr$_B$, $t_B$, represents its distance from a yet-unknown origin, $oriT_B$, in the CCW direction. The CCW distance from a point $C_1$ to a point $C_2$ on a $100$-minute circular map is given by $(C_1 - C_2) \\pmod{100}$.\n\n    Therefore, for any marker $X$ transferred by Hfr$_B$, its time of entry $t_{B,X}$ satisfies the relation:\n    $$ (C(oriT_B) - C(X)) \\pmod{100} = t_{B,X} $$\n    We can solve for $C(oriT_B)$ using the shared markers whose global coordinates are known from Hfr$_A$. Let us use the marker $azi$. We have $C(azi) = 12$ and its entry time from Hfr$_B$ is $t_{B,azi} = 28$.\n    $$ (C(oriT_B) - 12) \\pmod{100} = 28 $$\n    $$ C(oriT_B) = (28 + 12) \\pmod{100} $$\n    $$ C(oriT_B) = 40 $$\n    The global coordinate of $oriT_B$ is $40$.\n\n    We must verify this result using the other shared markers to ensure the consistency of the provided data.\n    -   Using marker $leu$: $C(leu) = 18$ and $t_{B,leu} = 22$.\n        $$ (C(oriT_B) - 18) \\pmod{100} = 22 $$\n        $$ C(oriT_B) = (22 + 18) \\pmod{100} = 40 $$\n    -   Using marker $pro$: $C(pro) = 86$ and $t_{B,pro} = 54$.\n        $$ (C(oriT_B) - 86) \\pmod{100} = 54 $$\n        $$ C(oriT_B) = (54 + 86) \\pmod{100} = 140 \\pmod{100} = 40 $$\n    All shared markers yield the same coordinate for $oriT_B$. The data are internally consistent.\n\n3.  **Determine the Global Coordinate of $met$**\n    Now that the location of $oriT_B$ is known to be $C(oriT_B) = 40$, we can determine the coordinate of any marker transferred by Hfr$_B$. The problem asks for the coordinate of $met$. The data for Hfr$_B$ states that the entry time for $met$ is $t_{B,met} = 33$ minutes.\n    This means the marker $met$ is located $33$ minutes CCW from $oriT_B$.\n    Using the same relation:\n    $$ (C(oriT_B) - C(met)) \\pmod{100} = t_{B,met} $$\n    $$ (40 - C(met)) \\pmod{100} = 33 $$\n    This implies $40 - C(met) = 33$, because a coordinate must be in the range $[0, 100)$.\n    $$ C(met) = 40 - 33 $$\n    $$ C(met) = 7 $$\n    The global clockwise coordinate of the marker $met$ is $7$ minutes.
