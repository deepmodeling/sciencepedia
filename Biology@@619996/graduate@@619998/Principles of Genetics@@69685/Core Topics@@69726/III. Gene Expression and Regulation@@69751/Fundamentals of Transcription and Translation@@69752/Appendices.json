It is grounded in the established principles of molecular biology, specifically transcriptomics and translatomics via ribosome profiling. The provided definitions and data are self-contained and consistent. We will proceed with a systematic solution.\n\nFirst, we define the per-gene translation efficiency, $TE_{g}$, for a given gene $g$. As stated in the problem, this is the ratio of ribosome engagement to mRNA availability. Let $R_{g}$ denote the normalized ribosome-protected fragment (RPF) density and $M_{g}$ denote the normalized messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) abundance. The per-gene translation efficiency is then given by:\n$$TE_{g} = \\frac{R_{g}}{M_{g}}$$\nThis quantity is dimensionless as the units of the normalized densities cancel. We compute this for each gene provided.\n\nFor the high codon-optimality bin:\n- Gene $HX1$: $TE_{HX1} = \\frac{200}{100} = 2.0$\n- Gene $HX2$: $TE_{HX2} = \\frac{250}{100} = 2.5$\n- Gene $HX3$: $TE_{HX3} = \\frac{312.5}{100} = 3.125$\n\nFor the low codon-optimality bin:\n- Gene $LX1$: $TE_{LX1} = \\frac{100}{100} = 1.0$\n- Gene $LX2$: $TE_{LX2} = \\frac{125}{100} = 1.25$\n- Gene $LX3$: $TE_{LX3} = \\frac{156.25}{100} = 1.5625$\n\nNext, we must choose an appropriate estimator for the central tendency of translation efficiency at the bin level. The problem directs us to use a first-principles noise model for ratios under multiplicative variability. Measurements from high-throughput sequencing, such as mRNA abundance and RPF density, are fundamentally count-based. The noise in such measurements is not typically additive but multiplicative; that is, the magnitude of the error scales with the magnitude of the signal. An observed measurement $X_{obs}$ can be modeled as the product of the true value $X_{true}$ and a random noise factor $\\epsilon$, such that $X_{obs} = X_{true} \\cdot \\epsilon$.\n\nGiven this model, the observed translation efficiency $TE_{obs}$ is a ratio of two such variables:\n$$TE_{obs} = \\frac{R_{obs}}{M_{obs}} = \\frac{R_{true} \\cdot \\epsilon_{R}}{M_{true} \\cdot \\epsilon_{M}} = \\frac{R_{true}}{M_{true}} \\cdot \\frac{\\epsilon_{R}}{\\epsilon_{M}} = TE_{true} \\cdot \\epsilon_{TE}$$\nwhere $\\epsilon_{TE}$ is the composite multiplicative noise term for the ratio.\n\nTo properly handle multiplicative noise, one must perform a logarithmic transformation. Taking the logarithm converts multiplicative relationships to additive ones:\n$$\\ln(TE_{obs}) = \\ln(TE_{true}) + \\ln(\\epsilon_{TE})$$\nIn this log-transformed space, the noise is now additive. For a set of measurements $\\{TE_{g}\\}$, the corresponding set of log-transformed values is $\\{\\ln(TE_{g})\\}$. The best linear unbiased estimator for the central tendency of a distribution with additive, zero-mean noise is the arithmetic mean. Therefore, the estimator for the central tendency in log-space is:\n$$\\mu_{\\ln(TE)} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{g=1}^{N} \\ln(TE_{g})$$\nTo express this central tendency on the original, linear scale, we must apply the inverse transformation, which is exponentiation:\n$$\\widehat{TE} = \\exp(\\mu_{\\ln(TE)}) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{g=1}^{N} \\ln(TE_{g})\\right)$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this expression is equivalent to:\n$$\\widehat{TE} = \\exp\\left(\\ln\\left(\\left(\\prod_{g=1}^{N} TE_{g}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{N}}\\right)\\right) = \\left(\\prod_{g=1}^{N} TE_{g}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{N}}$$\nThis is the definition of the geometric mean. Thus, the geometric mean is the correct and principled estimator for the central tendency of ratio-metric data subject to multiplicative noise. The arithmetic mean would be inappropriate as it is heavily skewed by large values, which are a characteristic feature of distributions arising from multiplicative processes (often approximated by a log-normal distribution).\n\nNow, we compute the bin-level $TE$ for the high-optimality ($TE_{\\mathrm{high}}$) and low-optimality ($TE_{\\mathrm{low}}$) bins using the geometric mean.\nFor the high-optimality bin ($N=3$):\n$$TE_{\\mathrm{high}} = (TE_{HX1} \\cdot TE_{HX2} \\cdot TE_{HX3})^{\\frac{1}{3}} = (2.0 \\cdot 2.5 \\cdot 3.125)^{\\frac{1}{3}} = (15.625)^{\\frac{1}{3}} = 2.5$$\nFor the low-optimality bin ($N=3$):\n$$TE_{\\mathrm{low}} = (TE_{LX1} \\cdot TE_{LX2} \\cdot TE_{LX3})^{\\frac{1}{3}} = (1.0 \\cdot 1.25 \\cdot 1.5625)^{\\frac{1}{3}} = (1.953125)^{\\frac{1}{3}} = 1.25$$\nFinally, we quantify the effect of codon optimality on translation by computing the base-$2$ logarithm of the fold-change between the bin-level translation efficiencies. The fold-change is:\n$$\\frac{TE_{\\mathrm{high}}}{TE_{\\mathrm{low}}} = \\frac{2.5}{1.25} = 2.0$$\nThe base-$2$ logarithm of this fold-change is:\n$$\\log_{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{TE_{\\mathrm{high}}}{TE_{\\mathrm{low}}}\\right) = \\log_{2}(2.0) = 1.0$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
