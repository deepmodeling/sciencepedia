Consider a single codon for which there are two competing classes of ternary complexes: a cognate class (subscript $c$) that correctly matches the codon and a near-cognate class (subscript $n$) that mismatches the codon by one nucleotide. Assume the following minimal, biophysically grounded, two-stage selection process:\n\n1. Initial selection: an aa-tRNA ternary complex binds the A site from solution and, while in the pre-accommodation complex, either dissociates back to solution or proceeds to GTP hydrolysis (activation).\n2. Proofreading step: after GTP hydrolysis, the aa-tRNA either dissociates before accommodation or successfully accommodates into the peptidyl transferase center, at which point incorporation is completed.\n\nModel each causal branch in each stage as a memoryless (exponential) process with constant hazard. Specifically, for each class $i \\in \\{c,n\\}$:\n- Association from solution occurs with a bimolecular on-rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{on},i}$ and bulk ternary complex concentration $[T]_i$, giving an arrival rate $k_{\\mathrm{on},i}[T]_i$.\n- Dissociation from the ribosome prior to accommodation occurs at rate $k_{\\mathrm{off},i}$ and is assumed to operate continuously until accommodation completes.\n- GTP hydrolysis occurs at rate $k_{\\mathrm{GTP},i}$.\n- Accommodation (commitment to incorporation) occurs at rate $k_{\\mathrm{acc},i}$.\n\nAssume only these two classes are present and compete for the same A site, the A site immediately returns to the empty state after any dissociation, and incorporation events reset the process for the next codon.

The model consists of two competing species, cognate ($c$) and near-cognate ($n$), vying for the A site of a ribosome. The process is modeled as a series of stochastic, memoryless steps, each with a constant rate. The misincorporation rate, $\\eta$, is defined as the steady-state fraction of total incorporation events that are of the near-cognate type.\n\nLet the flux, or rate of successful incorporation, for a species $i \\in \\{c, n\\}$ be denoted by $J_i$. The misincorporation rate $\\eta$ is then given by the ratio of the near-cognate flux to the total flux:\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{J_n}{J_c + J_n} $$\n\nTo determine the flux $J_i$, we must analyze the two-stage selection process. The flux is the product of the initial rate of ternary complex binding and the probabilities of successfully passing through the subsequent selection stages.\n\nThe initial binding of a ternary complex of species $i$ to an empty A site is a bimolecular process with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{on},i}$ and concentration $[T]_i$. The pseudo-first-order rate of binding is therefore $k_{\\mathrm{on},i}[T]_i$.\n\nOnce a complex is bound, it enters the first stage of selection. Here, it can either dissociate with rate $k_{\\mathrm{off},i}$ or undergo GTP hydrolysis with rate $k_{\\mathrm{GTP},i}$.

Build your reasoning from the Central Dogma and the kinetic proofreading paradigm of translation elongation, together with the following experimentally grounded facts, which you should treat as the fundamental base for your derivation:\n\n1. The initiator transfer RNA is delivered by Initiation Factor 2 (IF2), hydrolyzing $1$ GTP during initiation. The elongation phase then proceeds by repeated cycles of aminoacyl-tRNA delivery by Elongation Factor Tu (EF-Tu) and ribosomal translocation by Elongation Factor G (EF-G). Termination requires a release factor (RF$1$ or RF$2$), assisted by Release Factor 3 (RF3), and ribosome recycling by the Ribosome Recycling Factor (RRF) together with EF-G.\n2. Each amino acid is charged onto its cognate transfer RNA by an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase using hydrolysis of $1$ ATP to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate ($PP_i$) before it can be used in translation. Assume that this charging cost is $1$ ATP per residue incorporated into the final polypeptide and that charged transfer RNAs rejected by the ribosome remain charged and reusable (that is, ribosomal selection does not change ATP usage).\n3. In each elongation attempt at the aminoacyl-tRNA delivery step, there are two sequential fidelity checkpoints: an initial selection before GTP hydrolysis (rejection probability $r_0$) and a post-hydrolysis proofreading checkpoint after EF-Tu GTP hydrolysis (rejection probability $r_1$). If initial selection rejects, no GTP is hydrolyzed. If proofreading rejects, exactly $1$ GTP (by EF-Tu) has been hydrolyzed in that failed attempt. Upon successful accommodation after proofreading, peptidyl transfer occurs without additional nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis, and EF-G hydrolyzes $1$ GTP to translocate the ribosome. Assume successive attempts are independent with stationary $r_0$ and $r_1$ for a given codon, and that misincorporation is negligible relative to rejection (so only correctly matched aminoacyl-tRNAs ultimately succeed).\n4.

It describes the roles of canonical translation factors (IF2, EF-Tu, EF-G, RF3, RRF) and the energetic currency (ATP, GTP) correctly. The model is based on the kinetic proofreading paradigm, a cornerstone theory proposed by Hopfield and Ninio to explain the high fidelity of biological information transfer.

The objective is to compute an expected value, which is a well-defined mathematical quantity given the stated probabilities and costs. A unique solution exists and can be derived.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of any subjective or opinion-based claims.

It is a well-structured, scientifically sound problem in biophysical modeling. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe total energetic cost is the sum of costs from three distinct phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. We will compute the expected cost for ATP and GTP separately.\n\n**Expected ATP Hydrolysis, $E[\\text{ATP}]$**\n\nAccording to the provided information (Fact 2), $1$ ATP molecule is hydrolyzed to charge an amino acid to its cognate tRNA. The problem states to \"Assume that this charging cost is $1$ ATP per residue incorporated into the final polypeptide.\" A polypeptide of length $N$ contains $N$ amino acid residues. Since rejected charged tRNAs are reusable, the cost is not affected by rejection events during elongation. The total number of incorporated residues is deterministically $N$. Therefore, the total number of ATP molecules hydrolyzed is fixed.\n$$\nE[\\text{ATP}] = N\n$$\n\n**Expected GTP Hydrolysis, $E[\\text{GTP}]$**\n\nThe total expected GTP cost is the sum of the costs from the three phases of translation.\n$$\nE[\\text{GTP}] = E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{initiation}}] + E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{elongation}}] + E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{termination}}]\n$$\n\n1.  **Initiation Cost ($E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{initiation}}]$):**\n    Fact 1 states that initiation requires the hydrolysis of exactly $1$ GTP molecule. This is a fixed cost per polypeptide.\n    $$\n    E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{initiation}}] = 1\n    $$\n\n2.  **Termination Cost ($E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{termination}}]$):**\n    Fact 4 states that termination and ribosome recycling cost a total of $2$ GTP molecules. This is a fixed cost per polypeptide.\n    $$\n    E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{termination}}] = 2\n    $$\n\n3.  **Elongation Cost ($E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{elongation}}]$):**\n    A polypeptide of length $N$ requires $N-1$ cycles of elongation to add amino acids to the initial residue. The cost for each cycle is an independent and identically distributed random variable. Thus, the total expected elongation cost is $N-1$ times the expected cost of a single elongation cycle, $E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{cycle}}]$.\n    $$\n    E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{elongation}}] = (N-1) \\cdot E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{cycle}}]\n    $$\n    To find $E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{cycle}}]$, we analyze the probabilistic events within one cycle of adding a single amino acid. Let us set up a recurrence relation for $E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{cycle}}]$. An attempt can have three outcomes:\n    - **Initial rejection:** The aminoacyl-tRNA is rejected before EF-Tu hydrolyzes GTP. This occurs with probability $r_0$. The cost is $0$ GTP, and the process restarts.\n    - **Proofreading rejection:** The aminoacyl-tRNA passes initial selection (probability $1-r_0$) but is rejected after GTP hydrolysis (probability $r_1$). This event has a probability of $(1-r_0)r_1$. The cost is $1$ GTP, and the process restarts.\n    - **Success:** The aminoacyl-tRNA passes both initial selection (probability $1-r_0$) and proofreading (probability $1-r_1$). The probability of success is $p_{\\text{success}} = (1-r_0)(1-r_1)$. The cost associated with a successful attempt is $1$ GTP from EF-Tu and $1$ GTP from EF-G for translocation, totaling $2$ GTP. The cycle is then complete.\n\n    The expected cost $E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{cycle}}]$ can be expressed as the sum of the costs of each possible outcome of the first attempt, weighted by their probabilities:\n    $$\n    E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{cycle}}] = \\underbrace{r_0 \\cdot (0 + E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{cycle}}])}_{\\text{Initial rejection}} + \\underbrace{(1-r_0)r_1 \\cdot (1 + E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{cycle}}])}_{\\text{Proofreading rejection}} + \\underbrace{(1-r_0)(1-r_1) \\cdot 2}_{\\text{Success}}\n    $$\n    We solve for $E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{cycle}}]$:\n    $$\n    E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{cycle}}] = r_0 E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{cycle}}] + (1-r_0)r_1 + (1-r_0)r_1 E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{cycle}}] + 2(1-r_0)(1-r_1)\n    $$\n    Group terms containing $E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{cycle}}]$:\n    $$\n    E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{cycle}}] \\left( 1 - r_0 - (1-r_0)r_1 \\right) = (1-r_0)r_1 + 2(1-r_0)(1-r_1)\n    $$\n    The term in parentheses on the left is $1 - r_0 - r_1 + r_0r_1 = (1-r_0)(1-r_1)$, which is the success probability $p_{\\text{success}}$.\n    $$\n    E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{cycle}}] \\left( (1-r_0)(1-r_1) \\right) = (1-r_0)r_1 + 2(1-r_0)(1-r_1)\n    $$\n    Since $r_0 < 1$ and $r_1 < 1$, the term $(1-r_0)(1-r_1)$ is non-zero, so we can divide by it:\n    $$\n    E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{cycle}}] = \\frac{(1-r_0)r_1}{(1-r_0)(1-r_1)} + \\frac{2(1-r_0)(1-r_1)}{(1-r_0)(1-r_1)}\n    $$\n    The factor $(1-r_0)$ cancels, demonstrating that the initial, energy-free rejection step affects the rate of translation but not the energy cost per successful event.\n    $$\n    E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{cycle}}] = \\frac{r_1}{1-r_1} + 2\n    $$\n    This expression can be combined into a single fraction:\n    $$\n    E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{cycle}}] = \\frac{r_1 + 2(1-r_1)}{1-r_1} = \\frac{r_1 + 2 - 2r_1}{1-r_1} = \\frac{2-r_1}{1-r_1}\n    $$\n    Now, the total expected elongation cost is:\n    $$\n    E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{elongation}}] = (N-1) \\frac{2-r_1}{1-r_1}\n    $$\n\nFinally, we sum the GTP costs from all phases:\n$$\nE[\\text{GTP}] = E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{initiation}}] + E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{elongation}}] + E[\\text{GTP}_{\\text{termination}}]\n$$\n$$\nE[\\text{GTP}] = 1 + (N-1)\\frac{2-r_1}{1-r_1} + 2\n$$\n$$\nE[\\text{GTP}] = 3 + (N-1)\\frac{2-r_1}{1-r_1}\n$$\n\n**Final Answer Vector**\n\nThe problem asks for the result as a row vector containing the expected total numbers of GTP and ATP molecules.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} E[\\text{GTP}] & E[\\text{ATP}] \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 + (N-1)\\frac{2-r_1}{1-r_1} & N \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form symbolic expression for the expected energetic cost.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3 + (N-1)\\frac{2-r_1}{1-r_1} & N \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2807221"}, {"introduction": "Faithful protein synthesis requires not only precise elongation but also accurate termination at stop codons.

This provides the general expression for suppression frequency based on the kinetic parameters and concentrations of the competing catalysts, as requested:\n$$f_{supp} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat},T}}{K_{M,T}}\\right) [T]}{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat},T}}{K_{M,T}}\\right) [T] + \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat},R}}{K_{M,R}}\\right) [R]}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the numerical value for the new suppression frequency. The provided parameters are:\n- For the suppressor tRNA pathway ($T$): $[T]_0 = 2 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $k_{\\mathrm{cat},T} = 10 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $K_{M,T} = 5 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n- For the release factor pathway ($R$): $[R] = 1 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $k_{\\mathrm{cat},R} = 5 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $K_{M,R} = 0.5 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nThe problem requires calculating the suppression frequency when the suppressor tRNA concentration is doubled. The new concentration, $[T]$, is:\n$$[T] = 2 [T]_0 = 2 \\times (2 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}) = 4 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\n\nFirst, we determine the catalytic efficiencies for each pathway:\nThe catalytic efficiency for the suppressor tRNA is:\n$$\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat},T}}{K_{M,T}} = \\frac{10 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{5 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}} = 2 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe catalytic efficiency for the release factor is:\n$$\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat},R}}{K_{M,R}} = \\frac{5 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.5 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}} = 10 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n\nSubstituting these efficiencies and the relevant concentrations into the derived expression for $f_{supp}$:\n$$f_{supp} = \\frac{(2 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (4 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M})}{(2 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (4 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}) + (10 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (1 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M})}$$\nThe units of concentration ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) and the rate constants cancel, resulting in a dimensionless probability:\n$$f_{supp} = \\frac{2 \\times 4}{(2 \\times 4) + (10 \\times 1)} = \\frac{8}{8 + 10} = \\frac{8}{18}$$\nSimplifying the fraction gives:\n$$f_{supp} = \\frac{4}{9}$$\nAs a decimal, this is $0.444444...$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$f_{supp} \\approx 0.4444$$\nThis is the new suppression frequency under the specified conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4444}$$", "id": "2807205"}]}
