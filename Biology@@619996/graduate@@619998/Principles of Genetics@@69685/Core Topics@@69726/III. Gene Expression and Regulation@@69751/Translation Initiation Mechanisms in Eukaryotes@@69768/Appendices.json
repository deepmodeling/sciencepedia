In cap-dependent initiation, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binds the $5^{\\prime}$ cap and recruits the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex to promote ribosomal scanning. Assume a single eIF4E binds per cap and that binding is at rapid equilibrium. You are given the following experimentally measured dissociation constants for human eIF4E binding to the cap on otherwise identical RNAs: $K_{d,\\mathrm{cap0}} = 1.20\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $K_{d,\\mathrm{cap1}} = 0.300\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$.

For a specific type of cap, which we will index by $i$ (where $i$ is either cap0 or cap1), this fraction is defined as the concentration of occupied sites divided by the total concentration of sites of that type:\n$$\\theta_{i} = \\frac{[ER_i]}{[R_i]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$$\nThe total concentration of cap sites of type $i$, $[R_i]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, is the sum of free and bound sites:\n$$[R_i]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [R_i] + [ER_i]$$\nFrom this, we can express the concentration of free sites as $[R_i] = [R_i]_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [ER_i]$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $[R_i]$ into the $K_{d,i}$ equation:\n$$K_{d,i} = \\frac{[E]([R_i]_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [ER_i])}{[ER_i]}$$\nWe can now solve for the concentration of the complex, $[ER_i]$:\n$$K_{d,i} [ER_i] = [E][R_i]_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [E][ER_i]$$\n$$[ER_i](K_{d,i} + [E]) = [E][R_i]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$$\n$$[ER_i] = \\frac{[E][R_i]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{d,i} + [E]}$$\nNow, we substitute this result back into the definition of the fractional occupancy, $\\theta_i$:\n$$\\theta_{i} = \\frac{1}{[R_i]_{\\mathrm{tot}}} \\left( \\frac{[E][R_i]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{d,i} + [E]} \\right)$$\n$$\\theta_{i} = \\frac{[E]}{K_{d,i} + [E]}$$\nThis is the required expression for the equilibrium fraction of occupied cap sites in terms of the free eIF4E concentration $[E]$ and the dissociation constant $K_{d,i}$.\n\nNext, we must determine the free eIF4E concentration, $[E]$. The total concentration of eIF4E is given by the mass balance equation:\n$$[E]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [E] + [ER_{\\mathrm{cap0}}] + [ER_{\\mathrm{cap1}}]$$\nThe problem states that the total RNA concentration is $[R]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 5.0\\ \\mathrm{nM}$ and that the two cap types are present in equal molar amounts.

The total concentration of cap binding sites is $[R]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 5.0\\ \\mathrm{nM}$, while the total concentration of the binding protein eIF4E is $[E]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 500\\ \\mathrm{nM}$. We observe that $[E]_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\gg [R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$; specifically, the protein is in a $100$-fold molar excess over the total binding sites.\nThe total concentration of bound eIF4E is $[ER_{\\mathrm{cap0}}] + [ER_{\\mathrm{cap1}}]$. By definition, the maximum possible concentration of bound protein occurs when all RNA sites are occupied, so $[ER_{\\mathrm{total, max}}] = [R_{\\mathrm{cap0}}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} + [R_{\\mathrm{cap1}}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 5.0\\ \\mathrm{nM}$.\nThis maximum bound concentration represents only $\\frac{5.0\\ \\mathrm{nM}}{500\\ \\mathrm{nM}} = 0.01 = 1\\%$ of the total eIF4E.

This practice delves into the critical role of the initiation factor eIF1 in ensuring fidelity, acting as a gatekeeper that discriminates between optimal and suboptimal start sites. By analyzing a hypothetical mRNA with multiple potential start signals, you will build a mechanistic understanding of how eIF1's function governs the choice of initiation site and the phenomenon of leaky scanning. [@problem_id:2861838]", "problem": "In eukaryotic translation, the cap-dependent scanning model posits that a 43S preinitiation complex, consisting of the small ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic Initiation Factors (eIFs), and initiator $\\text{Met-tRNA}_i^{\\text{Met}}$ bound to guanosine triphosphate (GTP) via eIF2, is recruited to the $5'$ cap of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) by the eIF4F complex and eIF3. The complex scans from the $5'$ end toward the $3'$ end to locate a start codon. Successful selection of a start codon requires a match to the anticodon of the initiator tRNA (favoring AUG over near-cognates such as CUG, GUG, or AUU) and a favorable local nucleotide context (the Kozak consensus). eIF1 and eIF1A maintain an open, scanning-competent conformation of the 43S complex; start codon selection requires transition to a closed P$_{\\text{IN}}$ state accompanied by eIF1 dissociation. Consider an mRNA with an upstream near-cognate CUG in a strong Kozak context, followed by a short upstream open reading frame with a weak-context AUG, and a main open reading frame with a strong-context AUG. Cells are engineered to overexpress eIF1 without altering other factors. Which outcome best predicts how initiation at the weak-context AUG and the near-cognate CUG will change, and why, with specific reference to stabilization of the open scanning state and its energetic consequence for the open-to-closed transition?\n\nA. Initiation at both the weak-context AUG and the near-cognate CUG will decrease, with increased leaky scanning to the downstream strong-context AUG, because eIF1 overexpression stabilizes the open scanning state of the 43S complex and raises the threshold for forming the closed P$_{\\text{IN}}$ state unless the codon is AUG in an optimal Kozak context.\n\nB.

Initiation will be largely unchanged at both sites, because Kozak strength and $5'$ cap recognition by eIF4F determine start site choice independently of eIF1 levels, and stabilization of the open state does not affect the AUG-versus-near-cognate decision.\n\nD. Initiation at near-cognate codons in strong context will increase, while initiation at weak-context AUGs will be unchanged, because eIF1 stabilizes base-pairing of $\\text{Met-tRNA}_i^{\\text{Met}}$ with mismatched codons in the open state, selectively promoting recognition of near-cognates in favorable Kozak contexts.\n\nE. Initiation at all start sites, including optimal AUGs, will be suppressed to a similar extent, because excess eIF1 globally occludes $\\text{Met-tRNA}_i^{\\text{Met}}$ binding, independent of codon identity or Kozak context, and cap-dependent recruitment by eIF4F cannot overcome this occlusion.", "solution": "The mechanism of start codon selection is a competition between scanning continuation and initiation arrest. The 43S preinitiation complex (PIC) must transition from an \"open\" conformation, which is competent for scanning, to a \"closed\" conformation (the P$_{\\text{IN}}$ state), which is competent for initiation. The factor eIF1 plays a crucial role in this transition; it stabilizes the open conformation. For initiation to occur, the interaction between the start codon on the mRNA and the anticodon of the initiator tRNA ($\\text{Met-tRNA}_i^{\\text{Met}}$), supported by the surrounding Kozak context, must be strong enough to overcome the inhibitory effect of eIF1, leading to its dissociation and the irreversible transition to the closed state. Essentially, eIF1 acts as a fidelity checkpoint, raising the energetic barrier for the open-to-closed transition.\n\nThe strength of a potential start site is determined by two main factors: the identity of the codon (cognate `AUG` vs. near-cognate) and the strength of the Kozak consensus sequence. A strong signal, such as an `AUG` codon in an optimal Kozak context, provides sufficient binding energy to readily displace eIF1. Weaker signals, such as a near-cognate codon (e.g., `CUG`) or an `AUG` in a weak context, provide less binding energy and thus have a lower probability of successfully triggering the conformational switch.\n\nThe experimental perturbation is the overexpression of eIF1. According to the principles of chemical equilibrium and mass action, increasing the concentration of eIF1 will further stabilize the eIF1-bound \"open\" state of the 43S PIC. This makes it more difficult for the PIC to transition to the \"closed\" P$_{\\text{IN}}$ state. In energetic terms, the overexpression of eIF1 increases the activation energy for the conformational change required for initiation.\n\nThis has a direct consequence on fidelity: the system becomes more stringent. Start sites that were already weak (i.e., those that barely surmounted the original energetic barrier) will now be much less likely to trigger initiation.\nLet us analyze the specific sites on the given mRNA:\n1.  **Upstream `CUG` in a strong context**: The `CUG` codon is a near-cognate, meaning its base-pairing interaction with the anticodon of $\\text{Met-tRNA}_i^{\\text{Met}}$ is inherently weak and mismatched. While the strong context helps, the codon-anticodon mismatch is a severe defect. With the increased stringency from eIF1 overexpression, this weak interaction will be even less likely to promote eIF1 dissociation. Therefore, initiation at this `CUG` will decrease.\n2.  **Weak-context `AUG`**: Here, the codon-anticodon pairing (`AUG` with $\\text{Met-tRNA}_i^{\\text{Met}}$) is perfect (cognate). However, the weak Kozak context provides suboptimal interactions between the ribosome and the mRNA, making the overall recognition event less stable. This site is also a weak signal. With the higher barrier imposed by excess eIF1, initiation at this site will also be less favorable. Therefore, initiation at this weak-context `AUG` will decrease.\n\nThe consequence of decreased initiation at these two upstream sites is that a larger fraction of scanning 43S complexes will fail to initiate and will instead continue scanning downstream. This phenomenon is known as \"leaky scanning\". These ribosomes will then reach the third potential start site: the `AUG` of the main open reading frame, which is in a strong Kozak context. This site represents the strongest possible signal. It is the most likely site to successfully overcome the heightened barrier imposed by excess eIF1 and trigger initiation. As a result of increased leaky scanning past the upstream weak sites, initiation at the downstream strong-context `AUG` will relatively increase.\n\nEvaluation of Options\n\nA. Initiation at both the weak-context AUG and the near-cognate CUG will decrease, with increased leaky scanning to the downstream strong-context AUG, because eIF1 overexpression stabilizes the open scanning state of the 43S complex and raises the threshold for forming the closed P$_{\\text{IN}}$ state unless the codon is AUG in an optimal Kozak context.\nThis option is perfectly consistent with the derivation. It correctly predicts a decrease in initiation at both upstream weak sites and attributes it to the correct mechanism: stabilization of the open state by eIF1, which increases the stringency of start site selection (raises the threshold for the P$_{\\text{IN}}$ state transition). It also correctly predicts the consequence of increased leaky scanning. **Correct**.\n\nB. Initiation at weak-context AUGs will increase, while initiation at near-cognate codons will decrease, because eIF1 overexpression prolongs the scanning dwell time at AUG-like triplets, making even weak AUGs more likely to be recognized despite stabilizing the open state.\nThis is incorrect. The primary function of eIF1 is to act as a fidelity factor that *suppresses* initiation at weak sites. The idea that it would increase initiation at weak-context `AUG`s contradicts its established role. **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Initiation will be largely unchanged at both sites, because Kozak strength and $5'$ cap recognition by eIF4F determine start site choice independently of eIF1 levels, and stabilization of the open state does not affect the AUG-versus-near-cognate decision.\nThis is fundamentally incorrect. The level of eIF1 is a critical determinant of start codon selection fidelity. Stating that initiation is independent of eIF1 levels is factually wrong. The stabilization of the open state is the very mechanism by which eIF1 enforces fidelity and influences the choice between strong and weak start sites. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Initiation at near-cognate codons in strong context will increase, while initiation at weak-context AUGs will be unchanged, because eIF1 stabilizes base-pairing of $\\text{Met-tRNA}_i^{\\text{Met}}$ with mismatched codons in the open state, selectively promoting recognition of near-cognates in favorable Kozak contexts.\nThis is incorrect. It misrepresents the function of eIF1. eIF1 *prevents* stable base-pairing in the open state; its dissociation is what allows stable pairing to lock in. It does not stabilize mismatched pairs; it promotes their rejection. Increasing initiation at near-cognate codons would represent a *decrease* in fidelity, which is the opposite effect of overexpressing eIF1. **Incorrect**.\n\nE. Initiation at all start sites, including optimal AUGs, will be suppressed to a similar extent, because excess eIF1 globally occludes $\\text{Met-tRNA}_i^{\\text{Met}}$ binding, independent of codon identity or Kozak context, and cap-dependent recruitment by eIF4F cannot overcome this occlusion.\nThis is incorrect. While extreme overexpression of eIF1 can be globally inhibitory, its canonical role is as a *fidelity factor*, meaning its effect is selective and highly dependent on the strength of the start site (codon identity and context). The claim of suppression to a \"similar extent\" is wrong. The primary effect is a differential suppression, with weak sites being much more strongly affected than strong sites. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2861838"}, {"introduction": "The principles of translation initiation have tangible, measurable consequences for gene expression that can be quantified using modern techniques like ribosome profiling.

The estimator is then $\\hat{\\mu} = \\frac{\\sum w_i z_i}{\\sum w_i}$.\n\nThird, we apply this estimator to the data for each condition.\n\nFor condition $\\mathcal{C}$ (cap-competent), with $n=3$ replicates:\n- Replicate 1: $z_1 = \\ln(360) - \\ln(120) = \\ln(3)$. $\\sigma_1^2 = (0.05)^2 + (0.04)^2 = 0.0025 + 0.0016 = 0.0041$. $w_1 = 1/0.0041$.\n- Replicate 2: $z_2 = \\ln(310) - \\ln(100) = \\ln(3.1)$. $\\sigma_2^2 = (0.055)^2 + (0.04)^2 = 0.003025 + 0.0016 = 0.004625$. $w_2 = 1/0.004625$.\n- Replicate 3: $z_3 = \\ln(330) - \\ln(110) = \\ln(3)$. $\\sigma_3^2 = (0.05)^2 + (0.045)^2 = 0.0025 + 0.002025 = 0.004525$. $w_3 = 1/0.004525$.\n\nThe estimated mean $\\ln(TE)$ for condition $\\mathcal{C}$ is:\n$$\\hat{\\mu}_{\\mathcal{C}} = \\frac{ \\frac{\\ln(3)}{0.0041} + \\frac{\\ln(3.1)}{0.004625} + \\frac{\\ln(3)}{0.004525} }{ \\frac{1}{0.0041} + \\frac{1}{0.004625} + \\frac{1}{0.004525} }$$\nNumerically: $\\sum w_i \\approx 243.9024 + 216.2162 + 220.9945 = 681.1131$.\n$\\sum w_i z_i \\approx 243.9024 \\times \\ln(3) + 216.2162 \\times \\ln(3.1) + 220.9945 \\times \\ln(3) \\approx 268.0034 + 244.6491 + 242.8224 = 755.4749$.\n$$\\hat{\\mu}_{\\mathcal{C}} \\approx \\frac{755.4749}{681.1131} \\approx 1.1091765$$\n\nFor condition $\\mathcal{D}$ (cap-limited), with $n=3$ replicates:\n- Replicate 1: $z_1 = \\ln(172.5) - \\ln(115) = \\ln(1.5)$. $\\sigma_1^2 = (0.06)^2 + (0.05)^2 = 0.0036 + 0.0025 = 0.0061$. $w_1 = 1/0.0061$.\n- Replicate 2: $z_2 = \\ln(157.5) - \\ln(105) = \\ln(1.5)$. $\\sigma_2^2 = (0.065)^2 + (0.055)^2 = 0.004225 + 0.003025 = 0.00725$. $w_2 = 1/0.00725$.\n- Replicate 3: $z_3 = \\ln(140) - \\ln(100) = \\ln(1.4)$. $\\sigma_3^2 = (0.06)^2 + (0.05)^2 = 0.0036 + 0.0025 = 0.0061$. $w_3 = 1/0.0061$.\n\nThe estimated mean $\\ln(TE)$ for condition $\\mathcal{D}$ is:\n$$\\hat{\\mu}_{\\mathcal{D}} = \\frac{ \\frac{\\ln(1.5)}{0.0061} + \\frac{\\ln(1.5)}{0.00725} + \\frac{\\ln(1.4)}{0.0061} }{ \\frac{1}{0.0061} + \\frac{1}{0.00725} + \\frac{1}{0.0061} }$$\nNumerically: $\\sum w_i \\approx 163.9344 + 137.9310 + 163.9344 = 465.7998$.\n$\\sum w_i z_i \\approx 163.9344 \\times \\ln(1.5) + 137.9310 \\times \\ln(1.5) + 163.9344 \\times \\ln(1.4) \\approx 66.4670 + 55.9277 + 55.1583 = 177.5530$.\n$$\\hat{\\mu}_{\\mathcal{D}} \\approx \\frac{177.5530}{465.7998} \\approx 0.3811766$$\n\nFinally, we compute the log base $2$ fold-change of $TE$ for condition $\\mathcal{D}$ relative to $\\mathcal{C}$. This is commonly estimated as the difference of the mean logarithms.\n$$\\text{Log}_2 \\text{ Fold-Change} = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{TE_{\\mathcal{D}}}{TE_{\\mathcal{C}}}\\right)$$\nThis is estimated using the geometric means, which corresponds to exponentiating the mean of the logs:\n$$\\log_2\\left(\\frac{\\exp(\\hat{\\mu}_{\\mathcal{D}})}{\\exp(\\hat{\\mu}_{\\mathcal{C}})}\\right) = \\log_2(\\exp(\\hat{\\mu}_{\\mathcal{D}} - \\hat{\\mu}_{\\mathcal{C}}))$$\nUsing the change of base formula for logarithms, $\\log_b(x^y) = y \\log_b(x)$, and $\\log_2(e) = 1/\\ln(2)$:\n$$\\text{Log}_2 \\text{FC} = (\\hat{\\mu}_{\\mathcal{D}} - \\hat{\\mu}_{\\mathcal{C}}) \\log_2(e) = \\frac{\\hat{\\mu}_{\\mathcal{D}} - \\hat{\\mu}_{\\mathcal{C}}}{\\ln(2)}$$\nSubstituting the estimated values:\n$$\\text{Log}_2 \\text{FC} \\approx \\frac{0.3811766 - 1.1091765}{\\ln(2)} = \\frac{-0.7279999}{0.6931472} \\approx -1.050283$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $-1.050$.
