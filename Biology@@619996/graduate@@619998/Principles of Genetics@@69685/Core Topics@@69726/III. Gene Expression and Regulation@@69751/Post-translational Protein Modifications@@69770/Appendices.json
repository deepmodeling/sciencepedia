It describes a standard model of a covalent modification cycle in cell biology, specifically a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle operating under first-order kinetic conditions. The assumptions are clearly stated and physically plausible within certain biological regimes. We may proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system involves a transcription factor existing in two states: unphosphorylated, $S$, and phosphorylated, $S_{\\mathrm{p}}$. The total concentration, $S_{\\mathrm{T}}$, is constant:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{T}} = [S] + [S_{\\mathrm{p}}]$$\nThe rate of change of the concentration of the phosphorylated form, $[S_{\\mathrm{p}}]$, is determined by the difference between its rate of formation by the kinase and its rate of removal by the phosphatase.

This is expressed by the strict inequalities $[S] \\ll K_{1}$ and $[S_{\\mathrm{p}}] \\ll K_{2}$. Under these conditions, the Michaelis-Menten rate laws simplify to first-order kinetics with respect to the substrate concentration.\n\nFor the kinase, since $[S] \\ll K_{1}$, the denominator $K_{1} + [S]$ can be approximated as $K_{1}$. The rate law becomes:\n$$v_{1} \\approx \\frac{V_{1} [S]}{K_{1}}$$\nFor the phosphatase, since $[S_{\\mathrm{p}}] \\ll K_{2}$, the denominator $K_{2} + [S_{\\mathrm{p}}]$ can be approximated as $K_{2}$.

The ratios $\\frac{V_{1}}{K_{1}}$ and $\\frac{V_{2}}{K_{2}}$ represent the apparent first-order rate constants for the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions, respectively.\n\nAt steady state, the concentrations of all species are constant, which implies that the net rate of change of $[S_{\\mathrm{p}}]$ is zero.

I shall proceed.\n\nThe task is to design a spike-in Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acids in Cell culture (SILAC) experiment and derive an expression for phosphorylation occupancy. The experimental workflow provides the foundation for the mathematical model.\n\n**Experimental Design:**\n1.  Two populations of cells are cultured. The reference population, representing the baseline state, is grown in a medium containing heavy-isotope-labeled amino acids (e.g., $({}^{13}\\text{C}_6, {}^{15}\\text{N}_2)$-Lysine and $({}^{13}\\text{C}_6, {}^{15}\\text{N}_4)$-Arginine). This results in a proteome where essentially all proteins are 'heavy'. The experimental population is grown in standard 'light' medium.\n2.  The 'light' culture is subjected to the stimulus, while the 'heavy' culture is not.\n3.  After stimulation, cells from both cultures are harvested and lysed. A fixed amount of the heavy reference proteome (the 'spike-in') is mixed with the light experimental sample proteome.\n4.  The combined protein mixture undergoes enzymatic digestion (e.g., with trypsin) to generate peptides.\n5.  The resulting peptide mixture is analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The mass spectrometer measures the signal intensity for the light and heavy isotopic forms of both the phosphorylated peptide and its unphosphorylated counterpart.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles:**\n\nLet the molar amount of the phosphorylated peptide in the stimulated (light) sample be $P_s$ and in the reference (heavy) sample be $P_r$.\nLet the molar amount of the unphosphorylated (nonmodified) peptide in the stimulated (light) sample be $U_s$ and in the reference (heavy) sample be $U_r$.\n\nThe phosphorylation occupancy, $p$, is defined as the fraction of the total peptide pool that is phosphorylated:\n$$p = \\frac{P}{P + U}$$\nThus, for the stimulated and reference samples, we have:\n$$p_s = \\frac{P_s}{P_s + U_s}$$\n$$p_r = \\frac{P_r}{P_r + U_r}$$\n\nThe total amount of the site-containing peptide (phosphorylated plus unphosphorylated) in each sample is denoted by $T$:\n$$T_s = P_s + U_s$$\n$$T_r = P_r + U_r$$\n\nFrom these definitions, we can express the individual amounts in terms of total amounts and occupancies:\n$P_s = p_s T_s$ and $U_s = (1 - p_s) T_s$\n$P_r = p_r T_r$ and $U_r = (1 - p_r) T_r$\n\nAccording to the problem's assumption (ii), the mass spectrometer signal, $S$, for a given peptide is proportional to its molar amount multiplied by a response factor, $C$. This response factor depends on the chemical form of the peptide (i.e., phosphorylated vs. unphosphorylated) but is identical for light and heavy isotopologs of the same chemical form. Let $C_P$ be the response factor for the phosphorylated peptide and $C_U$ be the response factor for the unphosphorylated peptide. In general, $C_P \\neq C_U$ due to differences in ionization efficiency.\n\nThe measured signals for the four peptide species are:\n-   Signal for light phosphorylated peptide: $S_{P,s} = C_P \\cdot P_s$\n-   Signal for heavy phosphorylated peptide: $S_{P,r} = C_P \\cdot P_r$\n-   Signal for light unphosphorylated peptide: $S_{U,s} = C_U \\cdot U_s$\n-   Signal for heavy unphosphorylated peptide: $S_{U,r} = C_U \\cdot U_r$\n\nThe experiment measures the light-to-heavy signal ratios for the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides, denoted as $R_P$ and $R_U$, respectively.\nThe ratio for the phosphorylated peptide is:\n$$R_P = \\frac{S_{P,s}}{S_{P,r}} = \\frac{C_P \\cdot P_s}{C_P \\cdot P_r} = \\frac{P_s}{P_r}$$\nThe ratio for the unphosphorylated peptide is:\n$$R_U = \\frac{S_{U,s}}{S_{U,r}} = \\frac{C_U \\cdot U_s}{C_U \\cdot U_r} = \\frac{U_s}{U_r}$$\nCritically, the response factors $C_P$ and $C_U$ cancel out in these ratios. This is the key feature of the SILAC method that allows for accurate quantification independent of peptide-specific ionization efficiencies, thus fulfilling a core requirement of the problem.\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $P_s, P_r, U_s, U_r$ into the ratio equations:\n$$R_P = \\frac{p_s T_s}{p_r T_r}$$\n$$R_U = \\frac{(1 - p_s) T_s}{(1 - p_r) T_r}$$\n\nThese two equations contain the unknown ratio of total peptide amounts, $\\frac{T_s}{T_r}$. This term encapsulates both the biological change in the protein's expression level and the experimental mixing ratio of the light and heavy proteomes. To find $p_s$, we must eliminate this nuisance term. We can rearrange both equations to solve for $\\frac{T_s}{T_r}$:\nFrom the $R_P$ equation:\n$$\\frac{T_s}{T_r} = R_P \\frac{p_r}{p_s}$$\nFrom the $R_U$ equation:\n$$\\frac{T_s}{T_r} = R_U \\frac{1 - p_r}{1 - p_s}$$\n\nBy equating these two expressions for $\\frac{T_s}{T_r}$, we eliminate the unknown total amounts:\n$$R_P \\frac{p_r}{p_s} = R_U \\frac{1 - p_r}{1 - p_s}$$\nNow, we must solve this equation for $p_s$.\n$$R_P \\cdot p_r \\cdot (1 - p_s) = R_U \\cdot (1 - p_r) \\cdot p_s$$\n$$R_P p_r - R_P p_r p_s = R_U (1 - p_r) p_s$$\n$$R_P p_r = R_U (1 - p_r) p_s + R_P p_r p_s$$\n$$R_P p_r = p_s [R_U (1 - p_r) + R_P p_r]$$\n\nThis yields the final closed-form expression for $p_s$:\n$$p_s = \\frac{R_P p_r}{R_U (1 - p_r) + R_P p_r}$$\nThis expression for the phosphorylation occupancy in the stimulated sample, $p_s$, depends only on the experimentally measured ratios $R_P$ and $R_U$, and the known occupancy of the reference sample, $p_r$.\n\n**Calculation:**\nThe problem provides the following measured and known values:\n$R_P = 3.2$\n$R_U = 0.80$\n$p_r = 0.25$\n\nFirst, calculate $1 - p_r$:\n$1 - p_r = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$\n\nSubstitute these values into the derived expression:\n$$p_s = \\frac{(3.2) \\cdot (0.25)}{(0.80) \\cdot (0.75) + (3.2) \\cdot (0.25)}$$\nCalculate the terms in the numerator and denominator:\nNumerator: $3.2 \\times 0.25 = 0.8$\nDenominator term 1: $0.80 \\times 0.75 = 0.6$\nDenominator term 2: $3.2 \\times 0.25 = 0.8$\nSum of denominator terms: $0.6 + 0.8 = 1.4$\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n$$p_s = \\frac{0.8}{1.4}$$\nTo express this as an exact fraction:\n$$p_s = \\frac{0.8}{1.4} = \\frac{8}{14} = \\frac{4}{7}$$\nThe phosphorylation occupancy in the stimulated sample is precisely $\\frac{4}{7}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{4}{7}}$$", "id": "2839183"}, {"introduction": "Cellular regulation rarely involves a single modification in isolation; more often, it arises from a complex web of interacting pathways.

These physical solutions must lie within the simplex defined by $p^\\ast \\ge 0$, $g^\\ast \\ge 0$, and $p^\\ast + g^\\ast \\le 1$. Due to the nonlinearity introduced by the Hill-type inhibition terms, this system may have multiple solutions.\n\nTo find all solutions, a numerical approach is required. We will employ a robust numerical root-finding algorithm (such as `scipy.optimize.root`) initialized with a grid of starting points spanning the state space. This mitigates the risk of finding only a single solution when multiple exist. The found numerical solutions are then filtered to retain only those within the physical simplex and clustered to eliminate duplicates.\n\n**2. Linear Stability Analysis**\nThe stability of each steady state $(p^\\ast, g^\\ast)$ is determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix $J$ of the system evaluated at that point. The Jacobian matrix is given by:\n$$ J(p, g) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p} & \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial g} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial p} & \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial g} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe partial derivatives are calculated as:\n- $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p} = -\\frac{k_{p0}}{1 + a g^n} - d_p$\n- $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial g} = -\\frac{k_{p0}}{1 + a g^n} - \\frac{k_{p0}(1-p-g) a n g^{n-1}}{(1 + a g^n)^2}$\n- $\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial p} = -\\frac{k_{g0}}{1 + b p^m} - \\frac{k_{g0}(1-p-g) b m p^{m-1}}{(1 + b p^m)^2}$\n- $\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial g} = -\\frac{k_{g0}}{1 + b p^m} - d_g$\n\nA steady state $(p^\\ast, g^\\ast)$ is linearly stable if and only if all eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of the matrix $J(p^\\ast, g^\\ast)$ satisfy $\\text{Re}(\\lambda) < 0$. We will compute the eigenvalues for each valid steady state to identify the set of stable attractors.\n\n**3. Classification of System Behavior**\nThe final step is to classify the system's behavior based on its stable steady states.\n- Let $\\mathcal{S}$ be the set of unique, physically valid, and linearly stable steady states.\n- For each stable state $(p^\\ast, g^\\ast) \\in \\mathcal{S}$, we check its dominance. Based on our assumed margin $\\delta = 0.1$:\n  - The state is $p$-dominant if $p^\\ast - g^\\ast \\ge 0.1$.\n  - The state is $g$-dominant if $g^\\ast - p^\\ast \\ge 0.1$.\n- The system exhibits **mutual exclusivity** (output $1$) if $\\mathcal{S}$ contains at least one $p$-dominant state AND at least one $g$-dominant state.\n- Otherwise, the system exhibits **coexistence** or monostability (output $0$). This occurs if there is only one stable state, or if multiple stable states exist but they do not satisfy the complementary dominance criterion (e.g., all are coexistence states with $p^\\ast \\approx g^\\ast$, or multiple states are all $p$-dominant).\n\nThis complete procedure will be implemented for each of the three test cases specified in the problem statement.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import root\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a model of post-translational modification cross-talk for bistability.\n\n    The function iterates through a set of test cases, each defining the parameters\n    of a system of ODEs for phosphorylation (p) and O-GlcNAcylation (g).
