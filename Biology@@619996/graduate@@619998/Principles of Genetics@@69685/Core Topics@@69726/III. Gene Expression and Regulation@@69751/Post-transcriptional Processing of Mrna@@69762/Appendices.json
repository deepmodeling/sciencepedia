This process is carried out by a large ribonucleoprotein complex known as the spliceosome. The accuracy of splicing depends on the spliceosome's ability to recognize specific consensus sequences at the intron-exon boundaries. The canonical sequence at the 5' end of an intron, known as the 5' splice site or donor site, is 5'-GU-3'. The sequence at the 3' end, the 3' splice site or acceptor site, is typically 5'-AG-3'.\n\nConsider a hypothetical gene, `GENE-X`, which contains two exons (Exon 1 and Exon 2) separated by a single intron. A researcher discovers a mutant version of `GENE-X` in which a single point mutation has occurred. This mutation changes the first two nucleotides of the intron from $GU$ to $GC$. All other sequences, including the branch point and the 3' splice site, remain unchanged.\n\nWhat is the most direct and probable consequence of this mutation on the mRNA molecule produced from the mutated `GENE-X`?\n\nA. Splicing will proceed normally, as the spliceosome is flexible enough to recognize the $GC$ sequence, producing a normal mature mRNA.\n\nB. The spliceosome will fail to recognize the mutated 5' splice site, leading to the retention of the intron between Exon 1 and Exon 2 in the final mRNA product.\n\nC. The spliceosome will skip Exon 1 entirely and join the transcription start site directly to Exon 2.\n\nD. The mutation will be repaired at the RNA level, and a normal mature mRNA will be produced.\n\nE. The spliceosome will skip Exon 2 and ligate Exon 1 to the next exon downstream (Exon 3), if one exists.", "solution": "Splice site selection by the major spliceosome relies on conserved consensus sequences at intron boundaries, most prominently the $5'$ splice donor site with the canonical dinucleotide $GU$ at the intron start and the $3'$ splice acceptor site with the canonical dinucleotide $AG$ at the intron end (the so-called GT-AG rule in genomic DNA). Recognition of the $5'$ donor site is initiated primarily by base pairing between U1 snRNA and the $5'$ splice site sequence; disruption of the conserved $GU$ typically reduces U1 binding affinity and impairs spliceosome assembly at that junction.\n\nIn the hypothetical gene, the point mutation converts the first two nucleotides of the intron from $GU$ to $GC$, while the branch point and the $3'$ splice site remain unchanged. This specific change alters the canonical $GU$ dinucleotide that is essential for efficient recognition by the spliceosome. Although rare GC-AG introns do exist and can be recognized under certain sequence contexts, a de novo change from $GU$ to $GC$ at an otherwise canonical site most commonly weakens or abolishes recognition of that $5'$ splice site by U1 snRNP, thereby preventing proper assembly of the spliceosome at that junction.\n\nWhen the $5'$ splice site is not recognized, the first transesterification reaction cannot be initiated, and the intron is not excised. In the absence of an alternative strong cryptic $5'$ splice site nearby (not provided among the options), the most direct and probable consequence is intron retention between Exon 1 and Exon 2 in the processed transcript. Evaluating the options: A is unlikely because the spliceosome is not generally flexible enough to treat $GC$ as equivalent to $GU$ in a canonical site; C and E describe exon skipping patterns not directly predicted by an isolated $5'$ donor disruption at the intron start; D is incorrect because RNA-level repair is not a standard cellular mechanism for restoring the splice site. Therefore, the best-supported outcome is retention of the intron in the mRNA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1511957"}, {"introduction": "Building on the importance of canonical splice sites, we now explore the complexities that arise from their disruption or the appearance of new ones.

The process is eukaryotic post-transcriptional processing, specifically 3' polyadenylation of pre-mRNA.\n2.  Poly(A) polymerase (PAP) adds adenosine monophosphate residues one at a time.\n3.  The process terminates stochastically with a constant probability after each addition, reflecting a memoryless termination mechanism.\n4.  After each nucleotide addition, the process terminates independently with probability $p$.\n5.  Otherwise, it continues to add another nucleotide.\n6.

The number of added adenosine residues is to be treated as a discrete random variable.\n9.  The task is to derive the expected mean poly(A) length from basic probability and the definition of a memoryless, per-step termination process.\n10. The final answer must be an exact integer.\n\nValidation Verdict:\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded, describing a simplified but standard biophysical model of a well-understood molecular process (polymerase processivity and termination). The model of memoryless, stochastic termination is a common and appropriate application of probability theory, specifically Bernoulli trials, to a biological system. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to derive the requested quantity, and is free of ambiguity or contradiction.\n\nThe value given for the catalytic constant, $k_{\\mathrm{cat}} = 50\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, is a distractor. This parameter describes the rate of nucleotide addition but is not required to calculate the expected number of addition events (i.e., the length of the tail), which depends only on the termination probability $p$. The problem statement correctly guides the solver to use \"only the definition of a memoryless, per-step termination process and basic probability.\"\n\nSolution Derivation:\nLet $L$ be the discrete random variable representing the final length of the poly(A) tail, measured in adenosine residues. The process is a sequence of stochastic steps. After each nucleotide is added, a decision is made: terminate or continue. This is a sequence of Bernoulli trials.\n\nLet $E$ be the expected value of the random variable $L$, denoted as $E = E[L]$. We can derive $E$ by considering the outcome after the very first nucleotide addition. This approach relies on the memoryless property of the process.\n\nAfter the first adenosine residue is added, one of two mutually exclusive events occurs:\n1.  The process terminates. This happens with probability $p$. In this case, the final length of the tail is exactly $1$.\n2.  The process continues. This happens with probability $1-p$. In this case, one residue has been successfully added, and the polymerase is poised to add the next one. Because the process is memoryless, the subsequent elongation process is identical to the original one. Therefore, the expected *additional* number of residues to be added from this point forward is also $E$. The total expected length, conditioned on this event, is $1 + E$.\n\nUsing the law of total expectation, we can express $E$ as the weighted average of the outcomes of these two events:\n$$E = (p \\times 1) + ((1-p) \\times (1+E))$$\n\nThis equation provides a self-consistent relation for the expected length $E$. We now solve this equation for $E$:\n$$E = p + (1-p)(1+E)$$\n$$E = p + 1 + E - p - pE$$\n$$E = 1 + E - pE$$\nSubtracting $E$ from both sides of the equation yields:\n$$0 = 1 - pE$$\nRearranging the terms to solve for $E$:\n$$pE = 1$$\n$$E = \\frac{1}{p}$$\nThis result confirms that the expected length is the reciprocal of the termination probability, which is the well-known mean of a geometric distribution starting from $k=1$.\n\nThe problem provides the numerical value for the termination probability as $p = 0.02$. We substitute this value into our derived expression for the expected length:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{0.02}$$\nTo compute the exact integer value:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{\\frac{2}{100}} = \\frac{100}{2} = 50$$\nThus, the expected mean poly(A) length is $50$ adenosine residues.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{50}$$", "id": "2838966"}]}
