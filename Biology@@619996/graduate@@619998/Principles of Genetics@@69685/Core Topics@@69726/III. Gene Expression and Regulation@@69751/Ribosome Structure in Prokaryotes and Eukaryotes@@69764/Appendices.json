Consider the following tasks.\n\n1) Starting from the force balance at steady state and the operational definition of the Svedberg sedimentation coefficient, derive the dependence of $S$ on buoyant mass and friction for any rigid particle. Use only the definitions and force balance and do not assume any unproven formulas.\n\n2) Using the result of part (1), and denoting subunit quantities by subscripts $50$ and $30$ and the assembled ribosome by subscript $70$, explain mathematically why $S$ is not additive across independently measured subunits, that is, why $S_{70} \\neq S_{50} + S_{30}$. In your argument, assume that buoyant masses add upon assembly, so that $m_{b,70} = m_{b,50} + m_{b,30}$, and that the frictional coefficient of the assembled particle $f_{70}$ is not equal to either $f_{50}$ or $f_{30}$ but instead reflects the hydrodynamics of the combined shape.\n\n3) To make the reasoning quantitative, adopt the following hydrodynamic exposure model for the assembled ribosome: $f_{70} = a\\,f_{50} + b\\,f_{30}$ with $0 < a < 1$ and $0 < b < 1$, where $a$ and $b$ represent the solvent-exposed fractions of the isolated subunits’ frictional contributions that remain in the assembled complex due to inter-subunit shielding at the interface.

It is based on established principles of physical chemistry and molecular biology, specifically analytical ultracentrifugation. The questions are mathematically formalizable and free of ambiguity or contradiction. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nPart $1$: Derivation of the Svedberg Equation. At steady state in a centrifuge, a particle experiences a balance between 2 opposing forces: the centrifugal force, $F_{cent}$, driving it outwards, and the viscous drag force, $F_{drag}$, resisting this motion. The centrifugal force acts on the buoyant mass of the particle, $m_b$, not its true mass. The centrifugal acceleration at a radial distance $r$ from the axis of rotation for an angular velocity $\\omega$ is $\\omega^2 r$. Thus, the outward force is given by:\n$$ F_{cent} = m_b \\omega^2 r $$\nThe viscous drag force is proportional to the particle's velocity, $v$, through the frictional coefficient, $f$:\n$$ F_{drag} = f v $$\nAt steady state, these 2 forces are in equilibrium, $F_{cent} = F_{drag}$, which means:\n$$ m_b \\omega^2 r = f v $$\nWe can solve this equation for the steady-state velocity $v$, yielding:\n$$ v = \\frac{m_b \\omega^2 r}{f} $$\nThe Svedberg sedimentation coefficient, $S$, is defined operationally as the sedimentation velocity per unit centrifugal acceleration:\n$$ S = \\frac{v}{\\omega^2 r} $$\nSubstituting our expression for $v$ into this definition yields the fundamental relationship for the sedimentation coefficient:\n$$ S = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{m_b \\omega^2 r}{f}\\right)}{\\omega^2 r} $$\nThe terms $\\omega^2 r$ cancel, leading to the Svedberg equation, which relates the sedimentation coefficient to the intrinsic properties of the particle—its buoyant mass and frictional coefficient:\n$$ S = \\frac{m_b}{f} $$\nThis derivation relies only on the force balance and the definitions provided, as required.\n\nPart $2$: The Non-additivity of Sedimentation Coefficients. Using the result from Part $1$, we can write the sedimentation coefficients for the individual ribosomal subunits ($50\\text{S}$ and $30\\text{S}$) and the assembled ribosome ($70\\text{S}$). Let the buoyant masses be $m_{b,50}$, $m_{b,30}$, and $m_{b,70}$, and the frictional coefficients be $f_{50}$, $f_{30}$, and $f_{70}$. The respective sedimentation coefficients are:\n$$ S_{50} = \\frac{m_{b,50}}{f_{50}} $$\n$$ S_{30} = \\frac{m_{b,30}}{f_{30}} $$\n$$ S_{70} = \\frac{m_{b,70}}{f_{70}} $$\nA naive summation of the subunit coefficients gives:\n$$ S_{50} + S_{30} = \\frac{m_{b,50}}{f_{50}} + \\frac{m_{b,30}}{f_{30}} $$\nThe problem states the assumption that buoyant mass is conserved upon assembly:\n$$ m_{b,70} = m_{b,50} + m_{b,30} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $S_{70}$ gives:\n$$ S_{70} = \\frac{m_{b,50} + m_{b,30}}{f_{70}} $$\nThe question of additivity reduces to comparing these 2 quantities. It is a fundamental algebraic error to assume that\n$$ \\frac{m_{b,50} + m_{b,30}}{f_{70}} = \\frac{m_{b,50}}{f_{50}} + \\frac{m_{b,30}}{f_{30}} $$\nThis equality would only hold under highly contrived and non-physical conditions. Physically, the frictional coefficient $f$ depends on the overall size and shape of the particle and its hydrodynamic interaction with the solvent. When 2 subunits combine, the resulting complex is generally more compact and has a total solvent-exposed surface area that is less than the sum of the surface areas of the isolated subunits. This is due to the new interface formed between them, which shields a portion of each subunit's surface from the solvent. As a result, the frictional coefficient of the complex, $f_{70}$, is not a simple sum of $f_{50}$ and $f_{30}$, nor is it equal to either of them. Because the numerator (buoyant mass) is additive but the denominator (frictional coefficient) is not, the ratio $S$ is not additive. The non-additivity of Svedberg units is therefore a direct consequence of the fact that $S$ is a ratio of an extensive property (mass) and a complex, shape-dependent property (friction).\n\nPart $3$: Quantitative Analysis of a Mutation's Effect. We are given a model for the assembled ribosome's frictional coefficient:\n$$ f_{70} = a f_{50} + b f_{30} $$\nwith constraints $0 < a < 1$ and $0 < b < 1$. We also use the mass additivity assumption $m_{b,70} = m_{b,50} + m_{b,30}$. The sedimentation coefficient for the wild-type assembled ribosome, $S_{70}$, is thus:\n$$ S_{70} = \\frac{m_{b,70}}{f_{70}} = \\frac{m_{b,50} + m_{b,30}}{a f_{50} + b f_{30}} $$\nA mutation occurs that modifies the large subunit's frictional coefficient to $f_{50}'$, where $f_{50}' = 1.1 f_{50}$. All other parameters ($m_{b,50}$, $m_{b,30}$, $f_{30}$, $a$, $b$) remain unchanged. The new frictional coefficient for the assembled mutant ribosome, $f_{70}'$, is determined by the same model:\n$$ f_{70}' = a f_{50}' + b f_{30} = a (1.1 f_{50}) + b f_{30} = 1.1 a f_{50} + b f_{30} $$\nThe buoyant mass of the mutant ribosome, $m_{b,70}'$, is unchanged, as no mass was added or removed:\n$$ m_{b,70}' = m_{b,50} + m_{b,30} $$\nThe new sedimentation coefficient, $S_{70}'$, is therefore:\n$$ S_{70}' = \\frac{m_{b,70}'}{f_{70}'} = \\frac{m_{b,50} + m_{b,30}}{1.1 a f_{50} + b f_{30}} $$\nWe are required to find the ratio $S_{70}' / S_{70}$. We construct this ratio using the expressions derived above:\n$$ \\frac{S_{70}'}{S_{70}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{m_{b,50} + m_{b,30}}{1.1 a f_{50} + b f_{30}} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{m_{b,50} + m_{b,30}}{a f_{50} + b f_{30}} \\right)} $$\nThe numerator, representing the total buoyant mass, is a common factor and cancels mathematically, yielding:\n$$ \\frac{S_{70}'}{S_{70}} = \\frac{a f_{50} + b f_{30}}{1.1 a f_{50} + b f_{30}} $$\nThis is the final, exact, closed-form expression for the ratio in terms of the specified parameters $a$, $b$, $f_{50}$, and $f_{30}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{a f_{50} + b f_{30}}{1.1 a f_{50} + b f_{30}}}\n$$", "id": "2847005"}, {"introduction": "The fidelity of translation initiation is a critical determinant of cellular function, and prokaryotes and eukaryotes have evolved distinct strategies for start-site selection.

Following binding, the subunit, along with a complex of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), scans linearly along the mRNA in the $5' \\to 3'$ direction until it locates the first AUG start codon, often within a favorable sequence context known as the Kozak consensus sequence.
