Inducer (e.g., allolactose or IPTG) binds LacI, reducing its affinity for the operator.\n  - Positive control: Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) binds cAMP receptor protein (CRP). The CRP–cAMP complex binds near the *lac* promoter to stimulate recruitment of RNA polymerase. High extracellular glucose lowers intracellular cAMP.\n  - Genetic architecture: `lacI` encodes a diffusible repressor (trans-acting). The operator (`lacO`) and promoter (`lacP`) are cis-acting DNA elements.\n- **Output Categories (Qualitative Steady-State $\\beta$-galactosidase):**\n  - Off: near background expression.\n  - Low: derepressed basal transcription lacking positive activation by CRP–cAMP.\n  - High: fully induced transcription with CRP–cAMP activation.\n- **Growth Environments (Conditions):**\n  - Condition $1$: No inducer, no glucose.\n  - Condition $2$: Saturating inducer (IPTG), no glucose.\n  - Condition $3$: No inducer, high glucose.\n  - Condition $4$: Saturating inducer (IPTG), high glucose.\n- **Assumptions:**\n  - All strains are otherwise identical; `CRP` and adenylate cyclase are wild type.\n  - Inducer is non-metabolizable and saturating.\n  - “No glucose” implies high cAMP and available CRP–cAMP.\n  - “High glucose” implies low cAMP and scarce CRP–cAMP.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on the canonical model of *lac operon* regulation in *E. coli*, a fundamental and well-established topic in molecular genetics. All principles and definitions are standard textbook material. The problem is free of pseudoscience and factual errors.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary information to determine the phenotype of each mutant under each condition. The definitions of the alleles, conditions, and expression levels are clear and allow for a unique logical deduction.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, unbiased scientific language. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n- **No Flaws Detected:** The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, realistic, and well-structured.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. I will proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe expression of the *lac* operon, and thus the level of $\\beta$-galactosidase, is governed by two main control systems: negative control by the LacI repressor and positive control by the CRP–cAMP complex.\n\n- **Negative Control:** The `LacI` repressor binds to the operator `lacO`, blocking transcription. The inducer (e.g., `IPTG`) inactivates the repressor, allowing transcription. This is an on/off switch.\n- **Positive Control:** The `CRP-cAMP` complex binds to a site near the promoter `lacP`, enhancing `RNA polymerase` binding and transcription. The presence of glucose lowers `cAMP` levels, preventing the formation of `CRP-cAMP` and thus reducing transcription from its maximum level. This is a \"volume control\".\n\nLet's analyze the phenotype of each mutant strain under the four specified conditions.\n\n**1. Mutant: *lacI⁻* (loss-of-function repressor)**\nThe `lacI` gene produces a non-functional repressor protein that cannot bind to the operator. Therefore, the operon is constitutively derepressed, and its expression is solely regulated by the `CRP-cAMP` complex. The presence or absence of an inducer is irrelevant.\n\n- **Condition $1$ (No inducer, no glucose):** No functional repressor. The absence of glucose means high `cAMP` levels, so `CRP-cAMP` is present and activates transcription. The result is High expression.\n- **Condition $2$ (Inducer, no glucose):** No functional repressor. The absence of glucose leads to High expression, activated by `CRP-cAMP`. The inducer has no effect.\n- **Condition $3$ (No inducer, high glucose):** No functional repressor. The presence of glucose means low `cAMP` levels, so `CRP-cAMP` is absent. Only basal transcription occurs. The result is Low expression.\n- **Condition $4$ (Inducer, high glucose):** No functional repressor. The presence of glucose leads to Low expression due to the absence of `CRP-cAMP`. The inducer has no effect.\n**Summary for *lacI⁻***: High, High, Low, Low.\n\n**2. Mutant: *lacIˢ* (inducer-insensitive \"superrepressor\")**\nThe `lacIˢ` gene produces a repressor protein with an altered inducer-binding site. It cannot bind the inducer (`IPTG`) but can still bind to the operator (`lacO`). This repressor permanently binds to the operator, blocking transcription under all conditions.\n\n- **Condition $1$ (No inducer, no glucose):** The superrepressor is bound to the operator. Transcription is blocked. The result is Off.\n- **Condition $2$ (Inducer, no glucose):** The superrepressor cannot bind the inducer and remains bound to the operator. Transcription is blocked. The result is Off.\n- **Condition $3$ (No inducer, high glucose):** The superrepressor is bound to the operator. Transcription is blocked. The result is Off.\n- **Condition $4$ (Inducer, high glucose):** The superrepressor cannot bind the inducer and remains bound to the operator. Transcription is blocked. The result is Off.\n**Summary for *lacIˢ***: Off, Off, Off, Off.\n\n**3. Mutant: *lacOᶜ* (operator-constitutive)**\nThe `lacO` operator site is mutated such that no repressor protein (wild-type or superrepressor) can bind to it. This is a *cis*-acting mutation. Like the `lacI⁻` mutant, the operon is constitutively derepressed, and its expression is regulated only by the `CRP-cAMP` complex.\n\n- **Condition $1$ (No inducer, no glucose):** The repressor cannot bind the operator. The absence of glucose means high `cAMP` levels, so `CRP-cAMP` is present and activates transcription. The result is High expression.\n- **Condition $2$ (Inducer, no glucose):** The repressor cannot bind the operator. The absence of glucose leads to High expression.\n- **Condition $3$ (No inducer, high glucose):** The repressor cannot bind the operator. The presence of glucose means low `cAMP` levels, so `CRP-cAMP` is absent. Only basal transcription occurs. The result is Low expression.\n- **Condition $4$ (Inducer, high glucose):** The repressor cannot bind the operator. The presence of glucose leads to Low expression.\n**Summary for *lacOᶜ***: High, High, Low, Low.\n\n**4. Mutant: *lacP⁻* (promoter-defective)**\nThe `lacP` promoter site is mutated. `RNA polymerase` cannot bind effectively to the promoter to initiate transcription. This is a *cis*-acting mutation that prevents expression regardless of the status of the repressor or the `CRP-cAMP` complex.\n\n- **Condition $1$ (No inducer, no glucose):** `RNA polymerase` cannot bind. No transcription. The result is Off.\n- **Condition $2$ (Inducer, no glucose):** `RNA polymerase` cannot bind. No transcription. The result is Off.\n- **Condition $3$ (No inducer, high glucose):** `RNA polymerase` cannot bind. No transcription. The result is Off.\n- **Condition $4$ (Inducer, high glucose):** `RNA polymerase` cannot bind. No transcription. The result is Off.\n**Summary for *lacP⁻***: Off, Off, Off, Off.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nBased on the derived phenotypes:\n- ***lacI⁻***: High, High, Low, Low\n- ***lacIˢ***: Off, Off, Off, Off\n- ***lacOᶜ***: High, High, Low, Low\n- ***lacP⁻***: Off, Off, Off, Off\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**A.**\n- `lacI⁻`: High; High; Low; Low.

A defective promoter prevents transcription.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C.**\n- `lacI⁻`: Off; High; Off; Low. This is incorrect. A `lacI⁻` mutant is constitutive and does not require an inducer; expression should be `High` in Condition $1$.\n- `lacIˢ`: Off; High; Off; Low. This is incorrect. A superrepressor is not inducible.\n- `lacOᶜ`: Low; High; Low; High. This is incorrect. An `lacOᶜ` mutant is constitutive; expression should be `High` in Condition $1$.\n- `lacP⁻`: Off; Off; Off; Off. This part is correct, but the option as a whole is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D.**\n- `lacI⁻`: Low; Low; Low; Low. This is incorrect. Without glucose (Conditions $1$ and $2$), `CRP-cAMP` activation should lead to `High` expression, not `Low`.\n- `lacIˢ`: Off; Off; Off; Off. This part is correct.\n- `lacOᶜ`: High; High; High; High. This is incorrect. It ignores catabolite repression.\n- `lacP⁻`: Off; Low; Off; Low. This is incorrect. A defective promoter prevents transcription.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nThe only option that correctly describes the phenotypes for all four mutants across all four conditions is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2858996"}, {"introduction": "Genetic regulation becomes even more interesting in diploid or partially diploid organisms, where interactions between different alleles occur. This practice [@problem_id:2859049] explores the concepts of genetic dominance, cis-acting sites, and trans-acting factors within a merodiploid E. coli cell. You will reason through how a constitutive operator mutation, $lacO^{c}$, can cleverly circumvent the effects of a dominant \"superrepressor,\" $lacI^{s}$, providing a powerful illustration of the intricate logic of gene circuits.", "problem": "An Escherichia coli partial diploid ($F'$ merodiploid) is constructed to test the interplay between induction by lactose analogs and catabolite repression in the lactose operon. The following foundational facts are available and should be treated as the starting points for reasoning.\n\n- In the lactose operon, the repressor encoded by $lacI$ binds the operator $lacO$ to prevent transcription; binding of inducer (allolactose or isopropyl $\\beta$-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)) to the $LacI$ repressor reduces its affinity for $lacO$, thereby permitting transcription of the structural genes ($lacZ$, $lacY$, $lacA$) by RNA polymerase.\n- The $lacI^s$ (superrepressor) allele encodes a repressor that does not respond to inducer; it continues to bind $lacO$ and repress transcription even in the presence of inducer.\n- The operator $lacO$ acts only in cis (it is a DNA site); the repressor $LacI$ acts in trans (it is a diffusible protein).\n- The $lacO^c$ (operator-constitutive) allele alters the operator DNA such that $LacI$ cannot bind, causing the linked operon to be refractory to repression, but the promoter still requires positive control for high expression.\n- Positive control of the lactose operon requires cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) bound to the catabolite activator protein (CAP; also called cAMP receptor protein (CRP)). When glucose is present, intracellular cAMP is low and CAP is inactive, reducing transcription from the $lac$ promoter even if the repressor is not bound (catabolite repression).\n- $LacI$ functions as an oligomer; $lacI^s$ subunits form mixed oligomers with $lacI^+$ subunits and confer non-inducibility, explaining dominance in trans.\n\nA strain has the chromosomal genotype $lacI^+\\, lacO^+\\, lacZ^-\\, lacY^+$ and carries an $F'$ episome with genotype $lacI^s\\, lacO^c\\, lacZ^+\\, lacY^+$. Thus, $\\beta$-galactosidase is produced only from the $lacZ^+$ gene on the $F'$ operon that is linked in cis to $lacO^c$. Consider the following growth conditions:\n\n- Condition $1$: No lactose, no glucose, no IPTG.\n- Condition $2$: Lactose present, no glucose.\n- Condition $3$: Lactose present, glucose present.\n- Condition $4$: IPTG present, no glucose, no lactose.\n\nWhich option gives the correct qualitative pattern of $\\beta$-galactosidase expression across these conditions and, critically, the correct mechanistic explanation for why $lacI^s$ is dominant over $lacI^+$ in trans but is nevertheless circumvented by $lacO^c$ in cis, while also accounting for catabolite repression?\n\nA. Pattern: Condition $1$: high; Condition $2$: high; Condition $3$: low; Condition $4$: high. Explanation: $lacI^s$ subunits oligomerize with $lacI^+$ to produce non-inducible repressor that acts in trans and keeps any $lacO^+$ operon off; however, $lacO^c$ prevents any repressor (including $lacI^s$) from binding in cis, so the linked $lacZ^+$ operon is expressed regardless of inducer. High expression requires cAMP–CAP, so glucose reduces expression even from $lacO^c$.\n\nB. Pattern: Condition $1$: none; Condition $2$: high; Condition $3$: low; Condition $4$: high. Explanation: $lacI^s$ is not fully dominant and can be inactivated by sufficiently high IPTG; $lacO^c$ has no special cis effect beyond raising basal transcription, so induction is still required for expression.\n\nC. Pattern: Condition $1$: high; Condition $2$: high; Condition $3$: high; Condition $4$: high. Explanation: $lacO^c$ bypasses both negative and positive control, so neither repressor nor glucose affect transcription once $lacO$ is mutated.\n\nD. Pattern: Condition $1$: low; Condition $2$: high; Condition $3$: low; Condition $4$: low. Explanation: $lacI^s$ dominance in trans stems from higher gene dosage and concentration of repressor relative to $lacI^+$, whereas $lacO^c$ titrates repressor in trans; catabolite repression is mediated via $LacI$, so IPTG cannot restore expression when glucose is absent.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation before a solution is attempted.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   **Bacterial Strain**: *Escherichia coli* partial diploid (F' merodiploid).\n-   **Genotype**:\n    -   Chromosome: `lacI+ lacO+ lacZ- lacY+`\n    -   F' episome: `lacI^s lacO^c lacZ+ lacY+`\n-   **Regulatory Principles**:\n    1.  `LacI` repressor, encoded by `lacI`, binds `lacO` to block transcription.\n    2.  Inducer (allolactose or IPTG) inactivates `LacI`, permitting transcription.\n    3.  `lacI^s` (superrepressor) is non-inducible and dominant in *trans* over `lacI^+` due to formation of mixed, non-inducible oligomers.\n    4.  `lacO^c` (operator-constitutive) is a cis-acting mutation that prevents `LacI` binding, making the linked operon refractory to repression.\n    5.  Positive control requires `cAMP-CAP` binding to the promoter for high-level transcription.\n    6.  High glucose leads to low `cAMP`, inactive `CAP`, and reduced transcription (catabolite repression), even if the operon is derepressed.\n-   **Object of Measurement**: $\\beta$-galactosidase activity, which is produced exclusively from the `lacZ^+` gene on the F' episome.\n-   **Experimental Conditions**:\n    -   Condition $1$: No lactose, no glucose, no IPTG.\n    -   Condition $2$: Lactose present, no glucose.\n    -   Condition $3$: Lactose present, glucose present.\n    -   Condition $4$: IPTG present, no glucose, no lactose.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, relying on the canonical Jacob-Monod model of *lac* operon regulation, including established concepts of cis/trans action, dominance, and catabolite repression. The problem is well-posed, providing a complete genotype and a clear set of conditions, with a question that can be answered by applying the given principles. The language is objective and precise. There are no contradictions, missing information, or scientific impossibilities. The problem is a valid test of understanding of gene regulation.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of $\\beta$-galactosidase Expression Pattern**\n\nThe analysis must focus on the F' episome's operon (`lacI^s lacO^c lacZ+ lacY+`), as it is the sole source of $\\beta$-galactosidase (`lacZ^+`).\n\n1.  **Analysis of Negative Control (Repression)**: The cell's cytoplasm contains a mixture of repressor proteins. The `lacI^+` allele on the chromosome produces wild-type repressor subunits, while the `lacI^s` allele on the episome produces superrepressor subunits. As stated, these form mixed oligomers that are predominantly non-inducible, effectively filling the cell with superrepressor protein (`LacI^s`). This superrepressor acts in *trans* and would repress any operon with a wild-type operator (`lacO^+`), such as the one on the chromosome. However, the operon we are measuring for `lacZ^+` expression is on the F' episome and has a constitutive operator, `lacO^c`. By definition, the `lacO^c` mutation prevents the binding of any repressor protein, including the `LacI^s` superrepressor. Therefore, the `lacZ^+` gene is constitutively derepressed; its transcription is not subject to negative control by the repressor, regardless of the presence or absence of an inducer (lactose or IPTG).\n\n2.  **Analysis of Positive Control (Catabolite Repression)**: The problem correctly states that an operon with a `lacO^c` mutation still requires positive control for *high* expression. This control is mediated by the `cAMP-CAP` complex.\n    -   **In the absence of glucose**: Intracellular `cAMP` levels are high. `cAMP` binds to `CAP`, and the active `cAMP-CAP` complex binds to the promoter, recruiting RNA polymerase and leading to a high rate of transcription.\n    -   **In the presence of glucose**: Intracellular `cAMP` levels are low. The `cAMP-CAP` complex does not form in sufficient quantity. The promoter is not activated, and transcription proceeds only at a low, basal level, even though the operator is unoccupied. This is catabolite repression.\n\n3.  **Evaluation of Conditions**:\n    -   **Condition $1$ (No lactose, no glucose, no IPTG)**: The operator is `lacO^c`, so there is no repression. Glucose is absent, so `cAMP` is high, `CAP` is active, and transcription is activated. The expected expression level of $\\beta$-galactosidase is **high**.\n    -   **Condition $2$ (Lactose present, no glucose)**: The operator is `lacO^c`, so there is no repression. The presence of lactose is irrelevant for negative control. Glucose is absent, so `cAMP` is high, `CAP` is active, and transcription is activated. The expected expression level is **high**.\n    -   **Condition $3$ (Lactose present, glucose present)**: The operator is `lacO^c`, so there is no repression. Glucose is present, so `cAMP` is low, `CAP` is inactive, and catabolite repression occurs. The expected expression level is **low**.\n    -   **Condition $4$ (IPTG present, no glucose, no lactose)**: The operator is `lacO^c`, so there is no repression. The presence of IPTG is irrelevant. Glucose is absent, so `cAMP` is high, `CAP` is active, and transcription is activated. The expected expression level is **high**.\n\nThe predicted qualitative pattern of expression is: Condition $1$: high; Condition $2$: high; Condition $3$: low; Condition $4$: high.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n-   **A.

It wrongly predicts \"none\" for Condition $1$, failing to recognize that the operon is both derepressed (`lacO^c`) and activated (no glucose).\n    -   The explanation is factually incorrect. It wrongly claims `lacI^s` is inducible, which contradicts the problem statement. It also fundamentally misunderstands the function of `lacO^c`, which is to abolish repressor binding, not merely \"raise basal transcription\".\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect**.\n\n-   **C.

It wrongly predicts \"high\" for Condition $3$, ignoring catabolite repression.\n    -   The explanation is fatally flawed. `lacO^c` bypasses negative control (repressor binding) but has no effect on positive control (catabolite repression at the promoter), a point explicitly made in the problem's foundational facts.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect**.\n\n-   **D. Pattern: Condition $1$: low; Condition $2$: high; Condition $3$: low; Condition $4$: low. Explanation: $lacI^s$ dominance in trans stems from higher gene dosage and concentration of repressor relative to $lacI^+$, whereas $lacO^c$ titrates repressor in trans; catabolite repression is mediated via $LacI$, so IPTG cannot restore expression when glucose is absent.**\n    -   The pattern is incorrect. It wrongly predicts \"low\" for Conditions $1$ and $4$.\n    -   The explanation contains multiple severe errors. The mechanism of `lacI^s` dominance is misstated. `lacO^c` is a *cis*-acting site, it cannot \"titrate repressor in trans\". Catabolite repression is mediated by `cAMP-CAP`, not `LacI`.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect**.\n\nTherefore, only option A provides the correct expression pattern and the correct, comprehensive mechanistic explanation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2859049"}, {"introduction": "While qualitative descriptions like \"high\" and \"low\" are useful, the reality of gene expression is analog and quantitative.

When glucose is absent (cAMP high), the activation factor is $F_{A} = \\alpha$; when glucose is present (cAMP low), $F_{A} = 1$.\n\n- Inducer exclusion by glucose reduces lactose permease activity such that intracellular lactose $[L]_{\\mathrm{in}}$ equals the extracellular lactose $[L]_{\\mathrm{out}}$ when glucose is absent, and equals $\\epsilon [L]_{\\mathrm{out}}$ when glucose is present, with $0 < \\epsilon < 1$.\n\n- The transcriptional output is proportional to the product of basal capacity and regulation, so the steady output is $T = B \\times F_{A} \\times P_{\\mathrm{free}}$.\n\nUse the parameter values $B = 1$ arbitrary units (a.u.), $R_{T} = 8$, $K_{R} = 2$, $K_{I} = 2$, $n = 1$, $\\alpha = 6$, $\\epsilon = \\dfrac{1}{4}$, and when lactose is supplied, $[L]_{\\mathrm{out}} = 6$; otherwise $[L]_{\\mathrm{out}} = 0$.\n\nCompute the lac operon transcriptional outputs $T$ for the four environmental conditions, in the following order: (i) no sugars ($[L]_{\\mathrm{out}} = 0$, glucose absent), (ii) lactose only ($[L]_{\\mathrm{out}} = 6$, glucose absent), (iii) glucose only ($[L]_{\\mathrm{out}} = 0$, glucose present), (iv) lactose $+$ glucose ($[L]_{\\mathrm{out}} = 6$, glucose present). Report the four values as a single row matrix in the stated order. Express the answer in arbitrary units.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and provides a complete and consistent set of information for a quantitative solution based on established principles of gene regulation modeling.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the transcriptional output, $T$, of the *lac operon* under four distinct environmental conditions. The output is given by the formula:\n$$T = B \\times F_{A} \\times P_{\\mathrm{free}}$$\nwhere $B$ is the basal capacity, $F_{A}$ is the activation factor, and $P_{\\mathrm{free}}$ is the probability of the promoter being free from repressor binding.\n\nFirst, we establish a simplified expression for $P_{\\mathrm{free}}$. The concentration of active repressor, $R_{a}$, is given by:\n$$R_{a} = \\frac{R_{T}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{[L]_{\\mathrm{in}}}{K_{I}}\\right)^{n}}$$\nWith the given parameters $R_{T} = 8$, $K_{I} = 2$, and $n = 1$, this becomes:\n$$R_{a} = \\frac{8}{1 + \\frac{[L]_{\\mathrm{in}}}{2}}$$\nThe probability that the promoter is free is:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{free}} = \\frac{K_{R}}{K_{R} + R_{a}}$$\nSubstituting the value $K_{R} = 2$ and the expression for $R_{a}$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{free}} = \\frac{2}{2 + R_{a}} = \\frac{2}{2 + \\frac{8}{1 + \\frac{[L]_{\\mathrm{in}}}{2}}}$$\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator in the main fraction's denominator:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{free}} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{2\\left(1 + \\frac{[L]_{\\mathrm{in}}}{2}\\right) + 8}{1 + \\frac{[L]_{\\mathrm{in}}}{2}}} = \\frac{2\\left(1 + \\frac{[L]_{\\mathrm{in}}}{2}\\right)}{2 + [L]_{\\mathrm{in}} + 8} = \\frac{2 + [L]_{\\mathrm{in}}}{10 + [L]_{\\mathrm{in}}}$$\nThis simplified expression for $P_{\\mathrm{free}}$ will be used for all conditions.
