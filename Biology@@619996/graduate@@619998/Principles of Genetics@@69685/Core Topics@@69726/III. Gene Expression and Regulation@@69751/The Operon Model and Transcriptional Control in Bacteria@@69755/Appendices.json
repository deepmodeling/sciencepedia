It is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and constraints defined for deriving a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is therefore valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe solution is constructed in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\nPart $1$: Enumeration of Microstates and Statistical Weights\n\nBased on the problem description, particularly the steric exclusion constraint (iv), the promoter can exist in one of three mutually exclusive states, or microstates. These are:\n$1$. The promoter is unoccupied (free).\n$2$. The promoter is bound by a single RNAP molecule.\n$3$. The promoter is bound by a single repressor molecule.\n\nThe state where both RNAP and repressor are bound simultaneously is forbidden. We will now assign a statistical weight to each of these allowed microstates using the principles of statistical mechanics and the law of mass action.\n\nThe statistical weight of a state is proportional to its equilibrium probability. By convention, the unbound state of the promoter is chosen as the reference state and is assigned a statistical weight of $1$.\n\nFor the state where RNAP is bound, consider the binding equilibrium:\n$D + P \\rightleftharpoons DP$\nHere, $D$ represents the free promoter and $DP$ is the RNAP-promoter complex. The dissociation constant $K_{P}$ is defined as:\n$$K_{P} = \\frac{[D][P]}{[DP]}$$\nwhere $[...]$ denotes activity or effective concentration. The ratio of the concentration of the bound complex to the free promoter is:\n$$\\frac{[DP]}{[D]} = \\frac{[P]}{K_{P}}$$\nSince the problem has defined $P$ as the free activity of RNAP, the statistical weight of the RNAP-bound state, relative to the free state (weight $1$), is $\\frac{P}{K_{P}}$.\n\nSimilarly, for the state where the repressor is bound, consider the binding equilibrium:\n$D + R \\rightleftharpoons DR$\nHere, $DR$ is the repressor-operator complex. The dissociation constant $K_{R}$ is:\n$$K_{R} = \\frac{[D][R]}{[DR]}$$\nThe ratio of the concentration of the repressor-bound complex to the free promoter is:\n$$\\frac{[DR]}{[D]} = \\frac{[R]}{K_{R}}$$\nUsing the given free activity $R$ for the repressor, the statistical weight of the repressor-bound state is $\\frac{R}{K_{R}}$.\n\nIn summary, the allowed microstates and their associated statistical weights are:\n- State $1$ (Promoter free): $w_{free} = 1$\n- State $2$ (Promoter bound by RNAP): $w_{P} = \\frac{P}{K_{P}}$\n- State $3$ (Promoter bound by Repressor): $w_{R} = \\frac{R}{K_{R}}$\n\nPart $2$: Construction of the Partition Function\n\nThe partition function, denoted by $Z$, is the sum of the statistical weights of all possible microstates of the system. It represents the normalization factor for the probability distribution of the states.\n$$Z = \\sum_{i} w_{i}$$\nFor this system, the partition function is the sum of the weights derived in Part $1$:\n$$Z = w_{free} + w_{P} + w_{R}$$\n$$Z = 1 + \\frac{P}{K_{P}} + \\frac{R}{K_{R}}$$\nThis is the partition function for the promoter in the presence of both RNAP and repressor.\n\nPart $3$: Derivation of the Fold-Change in Transcription Initiation\n\nAccording to the occupancy hypothesis (ii), the rate of transcription initiation, $\\Gamma$, is proportional to the probability that RNAP is bound to the promoter, $p_{P}$.\n$$\\Gamma \\propto p_{P}$$\nThe probability of any microstate $i$ is given by the ratio of its statistical weight $w_{i}$ to the partition function $Z$.\n$$p_{i} = \\frac{w_{i}}{Z}$$\nTherefore, the probability of RNAP binding is:\n$$p_{P} = \\frac{w_{P}}{Z} = \\frac{\\frac{P}{K_{P}}}{1 + \\frac{P}{K_{P}} + \\frac{R}{K_{R}}}$$\nThe transcription rate in the presence of repressor (at activity $R$) is thus:\n$$\\Gamma(R) = c \\cdot p_{P} = c \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{P}{K_{P}}}{1 + \\frac{P}{K_{P}} + \\frac{R}{K_{R}}}$$\nwhere $c$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nNext, we must find the transcription rate in the absence of repressor, which corresponds to the case where $R=0$. In this scenario, the microstate involving repressor binding is not possible. The system has only two states: free promoter (weight $1$) and RNAP-bound promoter (weight $P/K_{P}$). The partition function for this reduced system, $Z_{0}$, is:\n$$Z_{0} = 1 + \\frac{P}{K_{P}}$$\nThe probability of RNAP binding in the absence of repressor, $p_{P,0}$, is:\n$$p_{P,0} = \\frac{w_{P}}{Z_{0}} = \\frac{\\frac{P}{K_{P}}}{1 + \\frac{P}{K_{P}}}$$\nThe transcription rate in the absence of repressor is:\n$$\\Gamma(R=0) = c \\cdot p_{P,0} = c \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{P}{K_{P}}}{1 + \\frac{P}{K_{P}}}$$\nThe fold-change is defined as the ratio of the initiation rate in the presence of repressor to the rate in its absence.\n$$\\text{Fold-Change} = \\frac{\\Gamma(R)}{\\Gamma(R=0)}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the rates:\n$$\\text{Fold-Change} = \\frac{c \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{P}{K_{P}}}{1 + \\frac{P}{K_{P}} + \\frac{R}{K_{R}}}}{c \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{P}{K_{P}}}{1 + \\frac{P}{K_{P}}}}$$\nThe proportionality constant $c$ and the term $\\frac{P}{K_{P}}$ in the numerators cancel.\n$$\\text{Fold-Change} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{P}{K_{P}} + \\frac{R}{K_{R}}}}{\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{P}{K_{P}}}}$$\nSimplifying this complex fraction gives the final closed-form expression:\n$$\\text{Fold-Change} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{P}{K_{P}}}{1 + \\frac{P}{K_{P}} + \\frac{R}{K_{R}}}$$\nThis expression represents the reduction in transcription initiation due to the competitive binding of the repressor.

Therefore, a rigorous solution can be derived.\n\nThe objective is to compute the steady-state fractional occupancy of the operator, $\\theta$, by any repressor species.

The problem assumes that the concentration of operator sites is negligible, so binding to the operator does not significantly deplete the total repressor pool. Thus, the total repressor concentration, $[R]_{\\text{tot}}$, is the sum of the free apo and inducer-bound forms:\n$$ [R]_{\\text{tot}} = [R_{\\text{apo}}] + [R_{\\text{ind}}] $$\nThe equilibrium between these two forms is governed by the binding of the inducer, isopropyl $\\beta$-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), to the repressor:\n$$ R_{\\text{apo}} + \\mathrm{IPTG} \\rightleftharpoons R_{\\text{ind}} $$\nThe dissociation constant for this reaction is $K_{d}^{\\mathrm{IPTG}} = \\frac{[R_{\\text{apo}}][\\mathrm{IPTG}]}{[R_{\\text{ind}}]}$.

Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe core of the thermodynamic model is the enumeration of all possible microscopic states of the promoter and their corresponding statistical weights at equilibrium.
