It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular genetics and biophysics, specifically concerning the structure of B-form DNA and the mechanism of prokaryotic transcription initiation. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the helical nature of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The B-form of DNA, under physiological conditions, is a right-handed helix. The problem provides a helical repeat, $H$, of $10.5$ base pairs (bp) per full $360$-degree turn, which corresponds to an angle of $2\\pi$ radians.\n\nFirst, we must determine the angular rotation per base pair along the helical axis. Let this angular increment be denoted by $\\omega$. It is calculated by dividing the total angle of a full turn by the number of base pairs in that turn:\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi \\text{ radians}}{H} = \\frac{2\\pi}{10.5 \\text{ bp}}\n$$\nThis value, $\\omega$, represents the angle by which the DNA helix twists for each base pair a certain distance along the sequence.\n\nThe problem describes two promoters, a wild-type and a mutant, which differ only in the length of the spacer DNA separating the centers of the $-35$ and $-10$ recognition hexamers.\nThe wild-type spacer length is given as $L_{wt} = 17$ bp.\nThe mutant spacer length is given as $L_{mut} = 15$ bp.\n\nThe total rotational angle between the centers of the two hexamers is directly proportional to the length of the spacer separating them. For the wild-type promoter, this total angle, $\\theta_{wt}$, is:\n$$\n\\theta_{wt} = L_{wt} \\cdot \\omega = 17 \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{10.5}\n$$\nFor the mutant promoter, the total angle, $\\theta_{mut}$, is:\n$$\n\\theta_{mut} = L_{mut} \\cdot \\omega = 15 \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{10.5}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the minimal rotational misalignment angle, $\\Delta \\theta$, which is the absolute difference in the total rotational angles between the wild-type and a mutant configuration.\n$$\n\\Delta \\theta = |\\theta_{wt} - \\theta_{mut}|\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\theta_{wt}$ and $\\theta_{mut}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\theta = \\left| \\left(17 \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{10.5}\\right) - \\left(15 \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{10.5}\\right) \\right|\n$$\nWe can factor out the common term $\\frac{2\\pi}{10.5}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\theta = |(17 - 15)| \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{10.5}\n$$\nThe difference in spacer length is $\\Delta L = 17 - 15 = 2$ bp.\n$$\n\\Delta \\theta = 2 \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{10.5} = \\frac{4\\pi}{10.5}\n$$\nTo present this as a simplified analytical expression with integers in the fraction, we can express the denominator $10.5$ as $\\frac{21}{2}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\theta = \\frac{4\\pi}{\\frac{21}{2}}\n$$\nSimplifying the complex fraction gives:\n$$\n\\Delta \\theta = 4\\pi \\cdot \\frac{2}{21} = \\frac{8\\pi}{21}\n$$\nThis value, $\\frac{8\\pi}{21}$ radians, is the minimal nonnegative angular difference as requested, since $0 < \\frac{8\\pi}{21} < 2\\pi$.\n\nFor the qualitative inference: The condition for optimal simultaneous recognition of the $-35$ and $-10$ hexamers is that they must reside on the same face of the DNA helix, allowing the two corresponding DNA-binding domains of the sigma factor subunit to engage them without steric strain. The $17$ bp spacer is known to be near-optimal, meaning it provides the correct phasing. The calculated misalignment, $\\Delta\\theta = \\frac{8\\pi}{21}$ radians, corresponds to a rotation of approximately $68.6$ degrees. This is a substantial angular displacement, representing nearly one-fifth of a full helical turn. Such a large rotation would move the $-10$ hexamer to a significantly different helical face relative to the $-35$ hexamer. The domains within the sigma protein are held in a relatively fixed three-dimensional arrangement. Therefore, this misalignment is expected to be incompatible with efficient simultaneous binding by the single holoenzyme, leading to a severe reduction in promoter activity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{8\\pi}{21}}\n$$", "id": "2842479"}, {"introduction": "Beyond promoter architecture, the specific DNA sequence fine-tunes the energetics of RNA polymerase binding.

We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the fold-change in promoter occupancy due to a mutation. Occupancy, which we denote as $\\theta$, is the probability that the promoter is in the bound state. The system is described as a two-state system: unbound $(U)$ and bound $(B)$. According to statistical mechanics, the probability of being in a state $i$ is given by its Boltzmann weight divided by the partition function $Z$, which is the sum of all Boltzmann weights.\n\nThe free energy of the unbound state is $G_U$ and the bound state is $G_B$. The partition function for this system is:\n$$Z = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{G_U}{RT}\\right) + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{G_B}{RT}\\right)$$\nHere, $R$ is the molar gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.

In this limit, the denominator approaches $1$, and the expression for occupancy simplifies to:\n$$\\theta \\approx \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G}{RT}\\right)$$\nThis aligns with the problem's premise that the bound-state probability is proportional to the Boltzmann weight, where the proportionality constant, which includes factors like the concentration of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme, is assumed to be the same for both wild-type and mutant promoters and thus cancels in a ratio.\n\nLet $\\theta_{WT}$ and $\\Delta G_{WT}$ be the occupancy and binding free energy for the wild-type promoter, and let $\\theta_{mut}$ and $\\Delta G_{mut}$ be the corresponding quantities for the mutant promoter.\n$$\\theta_{WT} \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{WT}}{RT}\\right)$$\n$$\\theta_{mut} \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{mut}}{RT}\\right)$$\nThe fold-change in occupancy is the ratio $\\frac{\\theta_{mut}}{\\theta_{WT}}$.\n$$\\frac{\\theta_{mut}}{\\theta_{WT}} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{mut}}{RT}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{WT}}{RT}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{mut}}{RT} + \\frac{\\Delta G_{WT}}{RT}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{\\theta_{mut}}{\\theta_{WT}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{mut} - \\Delta G_{WT}}{RT}\\right)$$\nThe problem defines the change in the standard binding free energy as $\\Delta \\Delta G = \\Delta G_{mut} - \\Delta G_{WT}$.

Therefore, we model the state of the promoter using probabilities. Let $p_P$ be the probability that the promoter is free, and $p_{RPc}$ be the probability that it is occupied in the closed complex state. The problem implies that the formation of $RP_o$ is the commitment step and its reversal or accumulation is negligible on the timescales of interest, so we can establish a conservation of probability for the promoter states preceding this irreversible step:\n$$ p_P + p_{RPc} = 1 $$\nThe rate of change of the probability of the closed complex state, $p_{RPc}$, is described by the master equation derived from mass-action principles:\n$$ \\frac{dp_{RPc}}{dt} = k_1 [R] p_P - k_{-1} p_{RPc} - k_2 p_{RPc} $$\nHere, $k_1[R]$ is the pseudo-first-order rate constant for the binding of $R$ to $P$.
