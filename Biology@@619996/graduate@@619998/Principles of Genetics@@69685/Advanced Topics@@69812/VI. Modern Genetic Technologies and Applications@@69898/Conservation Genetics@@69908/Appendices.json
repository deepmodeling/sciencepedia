The problem is well-posed, with clear objectives and sufficient information for a unique solution. The language is objective and free of non-scientific claims. There are no violations of fundamental principles, missing data, or logical contradictions. The problem is a straightforward, standard exercise in population genetics analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing each task sequentially.\n\n**Task 1: Observed Heterozygosity ($H_O$)**\nObserved heterozygosity, $H_O$, is the proportion of heterozygous individuals in a sample. It is calculated as the number of heterozygotes, $N_{Aa}$, divided by the total number of individuals, $n$.\n\nFor subpopulation $1$:\n$H_{O,1} = \\frac{N_{Aa,1}}{n_1} = \\frac{18}{50} = 0.36$\n\nFor subpopulation $2$:\n$H_{O,2} = \\frac{N_{Aa,2}}{n_2} = \\frac{5}{20} = 0.25$\n\nFor subpopulation $3$:\n$H_{O,3} = \\frac{N_{Aa,3}}{n_3} = \\frac{40}{80} = 0.5$\n\n**Task 2: Expected Heterozygosity ($H_E$)**\nExpected heterozygosity, $H_E$, is the proportion of heterozygotes expected under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. It is calculated as $H_E = 2pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are the frequencies of the two alleles, $A$ and $a$, in the population. We first calculate these allele frequencies from the sample genotype counts. The frequency of allele $A$ is $p = \\frac{2N_{AA} + N_{Aa}}{2n}$, and the frequency of allele $a$ is $q = \\frac{2N_{aa} + N_{Aa}}{2n}$.\n\nFor subpopulation $1$ ($n_1 = 50$, $N_{AA,1} = 30$, $N_{Aa,1} = 18$, $N_{aa,1} = 2$):\n$p_1 = \\frac{2(30) + 18}{2(50)} = \\frac{78}{100} = 0.78$\n$q_1 = \\frac{2(2) + 18}{2(50)} = \\frac{22}{100} = 0.22$\n$H_{E,1} = 2 p_1 q_1 = 2(0.78)(0.22) = 0.3432$\n\nFor subpopulation $2$ ($n_2 = 20$, $N_{AA,2} = 15$, $N_{Aa,2} = 5$, $N_{aa,2} = 0$):\n$p_2 = \\frac{2(15) + 5}{2(20)} = \\frac{35}{40} = 0.875$\n$q_2 = \\frac{2(0) + 5}{2(20)} = \\frac{5}{40} = 0.125$\n$H_{E,2} = 2 p_2 q_2 = 2(0.875)(0.125) = 0.21875$\n\nFor subpopulation $3$ ($n_3 = 80$, $N_{AA,3} = 32$, $N_{Aa,3} = 40$, $N_{aa,3} = 8$):\n$p_3 = \\frac{2(32) + 40}{2(80)} = \\frac{104}{160} = 0.65$\n$q_3 = \\frac{2(8) + 40}{2(80)} = \\frac{56}{160} = 0.35$\n$H_{E,3} = 2 p_3 q_3 = 2(0.65)(0.35) = 0.455$\n\n**Task 3: Rarefied Allelic Richness**\nAllelic richness is the number of alleles present. To compare this metric across samples of different sizes, we use rarefaction to estimate the expected number of alleles in a standardized subsample of gene copies, $g$. The problem specifies $g=4$. The expected number of alleles, $A_g$, in a sample of size $g$ drawn from a population with $k$ alleles is given by the formula:\n$$E[A_g] = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\binom{N - N_i}{g}}{\\binom{N}{g}}\\right)$$\nwhere $N$ is the total number of gene copies in the original sample ($N=2n$), and $N_i$ is the number of copies of the $i$-th allele.\nFor a biallelic locus ($k=2$), the formula simplifies to:\n$$E[A_g] = 2 - \\frac{\\binom{N-N_A}{g} + \\binom{N-N_a}{g}}{\\binom{N}{g}} = 2 - \\frac{\\binom{N_a}{g} + \\binom{N_A}{g}}{\\binom{N_A+N_a}{g}}$$\nwhere $\\binom{n}{k} = 0$ if $k > n$.\n\nFor subpopulation $1$: $N=100$, $N_A=78$, $N_a=22$, $g=4$.\n$E[A_{4,1}] = 2 - \\frac{\\binom{22}{4} + \\binom{78}{4}}{\\binom{100}{4}}$\n\nFor subpopulation $2$: $N=40$, $N_A=35$, $N_a=5$, $g=4$.\n$E[A_{4,2}] = 2 - \\frac{\\binom{5}{4} + \\binom{35}{4}}{\\binom{40}{4}}$\n\nFor subpopulation $3$: $N=160$, $N_A=104$, $N_a=56$, $g=4$.\n$E[A_{4,3}] = 2 - \\frac{\\binom{56}{4} + \\binom{104}{4}}{\\binom{160}{4}}$\n\nNumerical evaluation is not required for the final answer, but the expressions are presented for completeness.\n\n**Task 4: Interpretation**\nWe compare $H_O$ and $H_E$ to assess deviations from HWE, and compare $H_E$ and rarefied allelic richness across subpopulations to infer demographic history.\n- **Subpopulation 1**: $H_{O,1} = 0.36$ and $H_{E,1} = 0.3432$. These values are very close ($H_O > H_E$), suggesting the genotype frequencies are near Hardy-Weinberg proportions. The difference is small and likely not statistically significant. This suggests a relatively large, stable population with random mating.\n- **Subpopulation 2**: $H_{O,2} = 0.25$ and $H_{E,2} = 0.21875$. There is an excess of heterozygotes ($H_O > H_E$). More importantly, this population has the lowest expected heterozygosity ($H_{E,2} = 0.21875$) and one allele ($a$) is at a low frequency ($q_2 = 0.125$), with only $5$ copies observed and no $aa$ homozygotes. This pattern—reduced genetic diversity and a skewed allele frequency spectrum—is characteristic of a population that has undergone a recent bottleneck or a founder event. The loss of rare alleles is a primary consequence of such demographic events. The rarefied allelic richness will be the lowest in this population, as the probability of sampling the rare allele 'a' is low.\n- **Subpopulation 3**: $H_{O,3} = 0.5$ and $H_{E,3} = 0.455$. Here, there is a more noticeable excess of heterozygotes ($H_O > H_E$). This population has the highest expected heterozygosity, indicating a higher level of underlying genetic diversity compared to the other two for this locus. The allele frequencies ($p_3=0.65, q_3=0.35$) are the most balanced. An excess of heterozygotes might suggest negative assortative mating or balancing selection at or near this locus. Alternatively, if this \"subpopulation\" is actually a recent admixture of two previously isolated populations with different allele frequencies (a Wahlund effect in reverse), it can also lead to a temporary excess of heterozygotes. Given its high diversity, this population may represent a larger, more stable ancestral population or one with a larger effective population size ($N_e$).\n\nIn summary, subpopulation $2$ shows clear signs of a recent demographic constriction (bottleneck/founder event), subpopulation $1$ appears relatively stable and in equilibrium, and subpopulation $3$ is the most diverse and shows an excess of heterozygotes, which could be due to various evolutionary or demographic factors.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\nThe problem requires the calculation of the mean of $(H_O - H_E)$ across the three subpopulations. Let $\\Delta_i = H_{O,i} - H_{E,i}$.\n\n$\\Delta_1 = H_{O,1} - H_{E,1} = 0.36 - 0.3432 = 0.0168$\n$\\Delta_2 = H_{O,2} - H_{E,2} = 0.25 - 0.21875 = 0.03125$\n$\\Delta_3 = H_{O,3} - H_{E,3} = 0.5 - 0.455 = 0.045$\n\nThe mean is calculated as:\n$\\text{Mean}(\\Delta) = \\frac{\\Delta_1 + \\Delta_2 + \\Delta_3}{3} = \\frac{0.0168 + 0.03125 + 0.045}{3} = \\frac{0.09305}{3} \\approx 0.03101666...$\n\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.03102$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.03102}$$", "id": "2801751"}, {"introduction": "Rarely does a species exist as a single, panmictic unit; more often, it is a metapopulation structured into distinct demes and regions with varying levels of gene flow.

The analysis will proceed in four sequential parts as requested, beginning with foundational calculations and culminating in a conservation-focused interpretation.\n\nThe fundamental principle behind this analysis is the partitioning of genetic diversity. For a given locus, the total genetic diversity in a metapopulation, denoted as $H_T$, can be partitioned into two components: the average diversity within subpopulations, $H_S$, and the diversity among subpopulations, $D_{ST} = H_T - H_S$. Wright's fixation index, $F_{ST}$, quantifies the proportion of total diversity that is found among subpopulations:\n$$F_{ST} = \\frac{H_T - H_S}{H_T}$$\nAMOVA extends this concept to a hierarchical structure, partitioning the total variance into components attributable to different levels of subdivision (e.g., demes within regions, regions within the total population).\n\n**1) Allele Frequencies and Heterozygosities**\n\nFirst, we calculate the allele frequencies for the major allele (A or B) at each locus for each of the four demes.

We use the allele-as-indicator method, where the total number of gene copies per deme is $n_{copies} = 50$, per region is $100$, and across the metapopulation is $200$ per locus.\n\nThe sums of squares (SS) are calculated for each locus:\n- $SS_a$ (among regions): $SS_a = \\sum_{r} n_{copies,r} (\\bar{p}_r - \\bar{p})^2$\n- $SS_b$ (among demes within regions): $SS_b = \\sum_{r} \\sum_{d} n_{copies,d} (\\bar{p}_d - \\bar{p}_r)^2$\n- $SS_c$ (within demes): $SS_c = \\sum_{d} n_{copies,d} \\bar{p}_d (1-\\bar{p}_d)$\n\nFor Locus A:\n$\\bar{p}_{A,r1} = \\frac{0.76+0.74}{2}=0.75$; $\\bar{p}_{A,r2} = \\frac{0.48+0.46}{2}=0.47$; $\\bar{p}_A=0.61$.\n$SS_{A,a} = 100(0.75-0.61)^2 + 100(0.47-0.61)^2 = 3.92$.\n$SS_{A,b} = 50(0.76-0.75)^2 + 50(0.74-0.75)^2 + 50(0.48-0.47)^2 + 50(0.46-0.47)^2 = 0.02$.\n$SS_{A,c} = 50(0.76 \\times 0.24 + 0.74 \\times 0.26 + 0.48 \\times 0.52 + 0.46 \\times 0.54) = 43.64$.\nDegrees of freedom are $df_a=1$, $df_b=2$, $df_c=196$.\nMean squares: $MS_{A,a}=3.92$, $MS_{A,b}=0.01$, $MS_{A,c}=43.64/196 \\approx 0.2227$.\nVariance components:\n$\\hat{\\sigma}_{A,c}^2 = MS_{A,c} \\approx 0.2227$.\n$\\hat{\\sigma}_{A,b}^2 = (MS_{A,b} - MS_{A,c})/50 = (0.01 - 0.2227)/50 < 0$, set to $0$.\n$\\hat{\\sigma}_{A,a}^2 = (MS_{A,a} - MS_{A,b})/100 = (3.92 - 0.01)/100 = 0.0391$.\n\nFor Locus B:\n$\\bar{p}_{B,r1} = \\frac{0.70+0.72}{2}=0.71$; $\\bar{p}_{B,r2} = \\frac{0.54+0.52}{2}=0.53$; $\\bar{p}_B=0.62$.\n$SS_{B,a} = 100(0.71-0.62)^2 + 100(0.53-0.62)^2 = 1.62$.\n$SS_{B,b} = 50(0.70-0.71)^2 + 50(0.72-0.71)^2 + 50(0.54-0.53)^2 + 50(0.52-0.53)^2 = 0.02$.\n$SS_{B,c} = 50(0.70 \\times 0.30 + 0.72 \\times 0.28 + 0.54 \\times 0.46 + 0.52 \\times 0.48) = 45.48$.\nMean squares: $MS_{B,a}=1.62$, $MS_{B,b}=0.01$, $MS_{B,c}=45.48/196 \\approx 0.2320$.\nVariance components:\n$\\hat{\\sigma}_{B,c}^2 = MS_{B,c} \\approx 0.2320$.\n$\\hat{\\sigma}_{B,b}^2 = (MS_{B,b} - MS_{B,c})/50 = (0.01 - 0.2320)/50 < 0$, set to $0$.\n$\\hat{\\sigma}_{B,a}^2 = (MS_{B,a} - MS_{B,b})/100 = (1.62 - 0.01)/100 = 0.0161$.\n\nAveraging the variance components across loci:\n$\\bar{\\sigma}_a^2 = (0.0391 + 0.0161)/2 = 0.0276$.\n$\\bar{\\sigma}_b^2 = (0 + 0)/2 = 0$.\n$\\bar{\\sigma}_c^2 = (0.2227 + 0.2320)/2 = 0.22735$.\nTotal variance $\\sigma_{Total}^2 = \\bar{\\sigma}_a^2 + \\bar{\\sigma}_b^2 + \\bar{\\sigma}_c^2 = 0.0276 + 0 + 0.22735 = 0.25495$.\n\nThe proportion of total variance at each level is:\n- Among regions: $\\frac{\\bar{\\sigma}_a^2}{\\sigma_{Total}^2} = \\frac{0.0276}{0.25495} \\approx 0.1083$ (or $10.83\\%$).\n- Among demes within regions: $\\frac{\\bar{\\sigma}_b^2}{\\sigma_{Total}^2} = 0$ (or $0\\%$).\n- Within demes: $\\frac{\\bar{\\sigma}_c^2}{\\sigma_{Total}^2} = \\frac{0.22735}{0.25495} \\approx 0.8917$ (or $89.17\\%$).\n\n**4) Interpretation for Conservation**\n\nThe results provide clear guidance for conservation management.\nThe multilocus $F_{ST}$ of approximately $0.059$ indicates a moderate level of overall genetic structuring among the four demes. This value suggests that gene flow across the entire metapopulation is restricted.\n\nThe AMOVA results refine this picture significantly. The partitioning of variance reveals a strong hierarchical structure. The variance component among regions ($\\Phi_{CT} \\approx 10.8\\%$) is substantial, indicating significant genetic differentiation between Region 1 (demes 1, 2) and Region 2 (demes 3, 4). In contrast, the variance component among demes within regions ($\\Phi_{SC} \\approx 0\\%$) is zero. This implies that while the two regions are genetically isolated from one another, gene flow is sufficiently high within each region to homogenize the demes located therein.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of genetic diversity ($89.2\\%$) is found within individual demes. This is a common finding in many species and underscores the importance of maintaining large, viable populations to conserve the total genetic variation of the species.\n\nFrom a conservation perspective, these findings lead to two primary conclusions:\n1.  **Delineating Management Units (MUs):** The significant differentiation between regions warrants their designation as separate MUs. Conservation strategies, including any potential translocations or habitat restoration efforts, should be managed independently for Region 1 and Region 2 to preserve their unique genetic identities and avoid potential outbreeding depression.\n2.  **Prioritizing Diversity:** The high proportion of within-deme diversity means that the conservation of the species' genetic resources depends critically on the health of each local deme. While demes within a region are genetically similar, the loss of any single deme would still represent a loss of overall population size and a portion of the metapopulation's total genetic diversity. Therefore, conservation efforts should prioritize maintaining large population sizes and healthy habitat conditions for all four demes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.05892}$$", "id": "2801704"}]}
