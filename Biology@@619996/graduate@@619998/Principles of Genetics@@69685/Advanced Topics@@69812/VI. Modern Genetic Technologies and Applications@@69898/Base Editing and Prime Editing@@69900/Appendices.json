Their enzymatic activity is confined to a small \"activity window\" on the DNA strand, and any susceptible base within this window can be modified.

Understanding this is fundamental to designing guide RNAs that minimize undesirable edits while maximizing on-target success.", "problem": "A researcher is designing an experiment using a Cytosine Base Editor (CBE) to introduce a targeted mutation. A CBE system consists of a modified Cas enzyme fused to a cytosine deaminase, which is directed to a specific DNA locus by a guide RNA (gRNA). At the target site, the DNA is unwound, and the deaminase chemically converts cytosine (C) bases to uracil (U) on the exposed single strand of DNA (the non-target strand). Subsequent DNA replication processes recognize uracil as thymine (T), resulting in a permanent C-to-T transition mutation.\n\nThis particular CBE has an \"activity window\" spanning from position 5 to position 9, inclusive, on the 20-nucleotide exposed non-target sequence. The positions are numbered 1 to 20, starting from the 5' end of the strand. The researcher's primary goal is to target and convert the cytosine at position 6.\n\nThe sequence of the 20-nucleotide exposed non-target strand is:\n5'-GGATCCGCTACGCATTGCAG-3'\n\nAssuming the CBE functions as expected and converts all available cytosines within its activity window (both the intended target and any potential \"bystander\" targets), what will be the final sequence of this 20-nucleotide strand after the editing and subsequent DNA replication have occurred?

Upon DNA replication, uracil is read as thymine, producing a permanent C-to-T transition at each edited position. Therefore, every cytosine within positions 5 through 9 (inclusive) on the given strand will become thymine; bases outside this window remain unchanged.\n\nIndexing the 20-nt non-target strand 5'-GGATCCGCTACGCATTGCAG-3' from the 5' end:\n1:G, 2:G, 3:A, 4:T, 5:C, 6:C, 7:G, 8:C, 9:T, 10:A, 11:C, 12:G, 13:C, 14:A, 15:T, 16:T, 17:G, 18:C, 19:A, 20:G.\n\nWithin the activity window (positions 5–9), the bases are: 5:C, 6:C, 7:G, 8:C, 9:T.

This targeting is not arbitrary; it depends on the presence of a specific Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequence. This exercise simulates a crucial step in experimental design: determining if a target nucleotide is \"editable\" by checking if a valid PAM exists nearby that can position the editor's fixed activity window correctly over the target base [@problem_id:1480056]. This practice highlights that the targetability of a base is a geometric problem governed by the editor's molecular architecture.", "problem": "A research team is investigating a genetic disorder caused by a single point mutation in the human `NEUROXIN-4` gene. The mutation is a C-to-T transition at position 31 of the coding strand, which results in a premature stop codon. To correct this mutation in a cell line, the team plans to use a state-of-the-art Adenine Base Editor (ABE).\n\nThis ABE system consists of a deaminase enzyme fused to a *Streptococcus pyogenes* Cas9 nickase. This specific editor recognizes the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequence 5'-NGG-3'. The guide RNA (gRNA) complexes with the editor and directs it to a 20-nucleotide target sequence in the genome called the protospacer. Successful binding requires the PAM sequence to be located on the non-target DNA strand, immediately 3' to the site where the gRNA binds.\n\nOnce bound, the ABE's deaminase chemically converts an adenine (A) to an inosine (I), which is then read as a guanine (G) by cellular machinery, effectively creating an A-to-G edit. The activity of the deaminase is restricted to a narrow \"editing window\": it can only modify adenines on the target strand (the strand not bound by the gRNA) that are opposite to positions 4 through 8 of the 20-nucleotide protospacer sequence. Position 1 of the protospacer is defined as the nucleotide furthest from the PAM sequence.\n\nBelow is the 50-base-pair sequence of the coding strand of the mutant `NEUROXIN-4` gene, with the pathogenic C-to-T mutation located at position 31.\n\nCoding Strand: 5'-`GATTACATAT TCCGGTCTGC AGTGGCCTGT TTTCGCTACC TTCTTCGCTA`-3'\n\nGiven the operational constraints of the ABE system, what is the most likely outcome of this experiment?\n\nA. The experiment will succeed because the adenine base editor can effectively target and correct the adenine on the template strand that corresponds to the pathogenic thymine.\n\nB. The experiment will fail because the only available Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) on the correct strand positions the editing window far from the target adenine.\n\nC. The experiment will fail because adenine base editors are designed to convert G-C pairs to A-T pairs, and cannot be used to reverse this process.\n\nD. The experiment will fail because an adenine base editor is the wrong tool; correcting a C-to-T mutation requires a cytosine base editor that can convert thymine back to cytosine.\n\nE. The experiment will succeed because a gRNA can be designed to bind to the template strand, positioning the editor to correct the pathogenic adenine directly.", "solution": "We are given a 50-nucleotide coding-strand sequence with a pathogenic C-to-T mutation at position 31 (coding strand index increases 5' to 3'). Thus, the mutant base pair at position 31 is T (coding) paired with A (template). To restore the wild-type C on the coding strand, the most direct base-editing strategy is to convert the template A opposite position 31 into G; after repair/replication, this can yield a C on the coding strand paired with G.\n\nThe adenine base editor (ABE) deaminates adenines on the target DNA strand (the strand not bound by the gRNA) within an editing window opposite protospacer positions 4 through 8, where position 1 of the protospacer is farthest from the PAM. The Cas9 nickase is from Streptococcus pyogenes and requires a 5'-NGG-3' PAM on the non-target strand (the strand not bound by the gRNA).\n\nTo edit the template A at position 31, the gRNA must bind the coding strand (so that the template is the unbound, deaminase-accessible strand). For SpCas9, placing the PAM on the non-target (template) strand corresponds to finding 5'-CCN-3' on the coding strand immediately adjacent to the protospacer. Let the coding-strand PAM start at position $c$, i.e., coding positions $c, c+1, c+2$ are C, C, N. For this orientation, the 20-nt protospacer on the coding strand runs from coding positions $c+3$ through $c+22$, where protospacer position $k$ corresponds to coding position $c+k+2$. The deaminase edits adenines on the template opposite protospacer positions $k \\in \\{4,5,6,7,8\\}$, i.e., opposite coding positions $c+6, c+7, c+8, c+9, c+10$. To place the target template adenine at position 31 into the window, coding position 31 must satisfy $c+6 \\leq 31 \\leq c+10$, which implies $21 \\leq c \\leq 25$.\n\nNow scan the provided coding strand for 5'-CCN-3' PAMs and record $c$:\n- Positions 12–14: C C G, so $c=12$.\n- Positions 26–28: C C T, so $c=26$.\n- Positions 39–41: C C T, so $c=39$.\n\nNone of these satisfy $21 \\leq c \\leq 25$. Therefore, there is no CCN on the coding strand that would allow a gRNA binding the coding strand to position the ABE editing window over the template adenine opposite coding position 31. Explicitly checking the windows:\n- For $c=12$, the window is coding positions $18$–$22$.\n- For $c=26$, the window is coding positions $32$–$36$.\n- For $c=39$, the protospacer would extend beyond the provided sequence; in any case, the window would lie far 3' of position 31.\n\nFor completeness, consider gRNA binding the template strand. This requires 5'-NGG-3' on the coding strand. Let the NGG on the coding strand start at position $p$ (coding positions $p,p+1,p+2$ are N,G,G). In this orientation, the protospacer on the coding strand corresponds to positions $p-20$ through $p-1$ (reverse orientation relative to the template protospacer), and the ABE edits adenines on the coding strand opposite protospacer positions 4–8, i.e., coding positions $p-8, p-7, p-6, p-5, p-4$. To include coding position 31 in this window, $p-8 \\leq 31 \\leq p-4$, which implies $35 \\leq p \\leq 39$.\nScanning the coding strand for NGG:\n- Positions 13–15: C G G, so $p=13$.\n- Positions 23–25: T G G, so $p=23$.\n\nNeither satisfies $35 \\leq p \\leq 39$, and moreover the base at coding position 31 is T (not A), so ABE cannot directly edit it.\n\nTherefore, under the given ABE operational constraints (SpCas9 NGG PAM on the non-target strand, editing window at protospacer positions 4–8 on the non-bound strand), there is no feasible gRNA-PAM configuration that places the ABE editing window over the template adenine opposite coding position 31. The attempt to correct the mutation with this ABE will fail because available PAM placements on the correct strand put the editing window away from the target adenine.\n\nEliminating the other options:\n- A and E incorrectly assert success; the editing window cannot be positioned over the target adenine.\n- C is false because ABEs convert A to G (not G-C to A-T).\n- D is incorrect because cytosine base editors mediate C-to-T changes; they do not convert T to C directly, and the appropriate opposite-strand correction here is A-to-G, which is the domain of ABEs.\n\nThus, the correct choice is that the experiment fails due to PAM/window positioning constraints.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1480056"}, {"introduction": "Gene editing in a population of cells is a stochastic process where not every cell or every allele is edited with perfect efficiency.
