The solution rests upon two fundamental principles of genetics: the maternal inheritance of cytoplasmic genomes (such as the mitochondrial genome where CMS traits are often encoded) and the Mendelian segregation of nuclear genes.\n\nLet us denote the CMS cytoplasm by $[C]$ and the normal cytoplasm by $[N]$. The nuclear genotype is determined by a single locus with two alleles, a dominant restorer allele $R$ and a recessive non-restorer allele $r$. Both parental plants have the heterozygous nuclear genotype $Rr$.\n\nThe problem states the following rules for phenotype expression:\n1.  In CMS cytoplasm $[C]$, genotypes $RR$ and $Rr$ are male fertile, while genotype $rr$ is male sterile.\n2.  In normal cytoplasm $[N]$, all genotypes ($RR$, $Rr$, and $rr$) are male fertile.\n\nThe inheritance of cytoplasm is strictly maternal, meaning all offspring from a given cross inherit the cytoplasm of the female parent exclusively.

A single nuclear locus has two alleles: a dominant restorer $Rf$ and a recessive non-restorer $rf$.

Maternal inheritance of cytoplasm implies that only the seed parent contributes cytoplasmic factors.

Under sporophytic restoration, the male-fertility phenotype of a plant is determined by its own diploid genotype. Thus, any plant genotype containing at least one copy of the dominant $Rf$ allele is male-fertile; only the homozygous $rf/rf$ genotype is male-sterile.\n\n3. Mendelian segregation at a single nuclear locus under self-pollination of a heterozygote yields the $1:2:1$ genotype ratio $Rf/Rf : Rf/rf : rf/rf$ in the offspring, provided there is no segregation distortion and random union of gametes.\n\nSet up the cross and the $F_{1}$:\n\n- The seed parent has CMS cytoplasm and nuclear genotype $rf/rf$.\n- The pollen parent is $Rf/rf$ with normal cytoplasm.\n\nBecause the cytoplasm is maternally inherited, all $F_{1}$ carry the CMS cytoplasm. The nuclear genotypes among $F_{1}$ are determined by the union of female gametes (all $rf$) with male gametes ($Rf$ or $rf$ in equal proportion).
