There are no contradictions or missing data.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a standard, well-posed problem in biophysical transport phenomena. A rigorous solution can be constructed.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe starting point is the governing partial differential equation for diffusion, Fick's second law:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla^{2} c\n$$\nHere, $c$ is the concentration of the diffusing species (AHL), $t$ is time, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $\\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator, which represents the spatial curvature of the concentration profile.\n\nThe method of scaling analysis, or dimensional analysis, is employed to estimate the characteristic time $\\tau$ required for the system to equilibrate over a characteristic length scale $L$. This method involves replacing the differential operators and variables with their characteristic scales.\n\nLet $\\Delta c$ represent the characteristic change in concentration across the system. The time derivative term, $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t}$, can be approximated by the ratio of the characteristic concentration change to the characteristic time scale, $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} \\sim \\frac{\\Delta c}{\\tau}\n$$\nThe Laplacian operator, $\\nabla^2$, has dimensions of inverse length squared. For a process occurring over a characteristic length $L$, the spatial term $\\nabla^2 c$ can be approximated by the ratio of the characteristic concentration change to the square of the characteristic length scale:\n$$\n\\nabla^{2} c \\sim \\frac{\\Delta c}{L^2}\n$$\nFor the differential equation to be dimensionally consistent and physically meaningful, all terms must have the same order of magnitude. Therefore, we equate the scales of the left-hand and right-hand sides of Fick's law:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta c}{\\tau} \\sim D \\left( \\frac{\\Delta c}{L^2} \\right)\n$$\nThe characteristic concentration scale $\\Delta c$, being a common factor on both sides, can be cancelled. This is expected, as the relaxation time of a linear diffusion process should not depend on the magnitude of the initial concentration gradient, only on the spatial scale and the medium's properties. This leaves us with the relationship between the characteristic time, length, and diffusion coefficient:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau} \\sim \\frac{D}{L^2}\n$$\nSolving for the characteristic equilibration time $\\tau$, we obtain the fundamental scaling law for diffusion:\n$$\n\\tau \\sim \\frac{L^2}{D}\n$$\nThis relationship shows that the time required for diffusion to equilibrate a system scales with the square of the characteristic distance.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the given parameters. It is imperative that all quantities be expressed in a consistent set of units before calculation. The diffusion coefficient $D$ is given in $\\text{cm}^{2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$. We must convert the length $L$ from micrometers ($\\mu\\text{m}$) to centimeters ($\\text{cm}$).\nGiven $L = 100\\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\nWe know that $1\\ \\text{cm} = 10^{4}\\ \\mu\\text{m}$. Therefore:\n$$\nL = 100\\ \\mu\\text{m} \\times \\left( \\frac{1\\ \\text{cm}}{10^{4}\\ \\mu\\text{m}} \\right) = 100 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\text{cm} = 10^{-2}\\ \\text{cm}\n$$\nThe diffusion coefficient is given as $D = 5 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{cm}^{2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived scaling relation for $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{L^2}{D} = \\frac{(10^{-2}\\ \\text{cm})^2}{5 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{cm}^{2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}\n$$\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{10^{-4}\\ \\text{cm}^2}{5 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{cm}^{2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{1}{5} \\times 10^{-4 - (-6)}\\ \\text{s}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau = 0.2 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\text{s} = 20\\ \\text{s}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures. The calculated value of $20$ seconds must be expressed as $20.0$ to satisfy this precision requirement. This indicates that the equilibration of the AHL signal across a $100\\ \\mu\\text{m}$ microcolony takes approximately $20.0$ seconds.

Consider a well-mixed chemostat of constant volume in which the bacterial population density is constant at $X$ (cells per liter) due to balanced growth and washout. AHL is synthesized intracellularly by a LuxI-type enzyme at a constant per-cell rate $k_s$ (molecules per cell per second), rapidly equilibrates across the membrane, and can therefore be treated as produced directly into the extracellular medium. The inflowing fresh medium contains no AHL.

The problem is well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution, and the parameter values are physically plausible. The only minor complication is the mixed time units ($s^{-1}$ and $h^{-1}$), which requires a standard unit conversion and does not constitute a flaw.\n\nWe proceed to the solution. The fundamental principle is the conservation of mass for the acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) species within the constant chemostat volume $V$. The mass balance equation for the concentration $A(t)$ is formulated by considering the rate of change of the total moles of AHL, $V A(t)$, in the reactor.\n\nThe rate of accumulation of AHL is equal to the rate of inflow minus the rate of outflow plus the net rate of generation.\n$$\n\\frac{d(V A)}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of Inflow}) - (\\text{Rate of Outflow}) + (\\text{Rate of Generation}) - (\\text{Rate of Loss})\n$$\nSince the volume $V$ is constant, the accumulation term simplifies to $V \\frac{dA}{dt}$.\n\nThe terms are defined as follows:\n1.  Rate of Inflow: The volumetric flow rate into the chemostat is $F$. The dilution rate is defined as $D = F/V$. The concentration of AHL in the inflow is given as $A_{in} = 0$. Thus, the rate of inflow of AHL is $F A_{in} = 0$.\n\n2.  Rate of Outflow: The concentration of AHL in the outflow is $A(t)$ due to the well-mixed assumption. The rate of outflow of AHL is $F A(t) = D V A(t)$.\n\n3.  Rate of Generation: AHL is produced by the bacteria. The total production rate is the per-cell rate $k_s$ multiplied by the total number of cells, $XV$. This gives a production rate in molecules per unit time per unit volume of $(k_s X)$. To express this in moles, we divide by Avogadro's number, $N_A$. The total molar production rate is $\\frac{k_s X V}{N_A}$.\n\n4.  Rate of Loss: AHL is lost via hydrolysis, which is a first-order process. The rate of loss due to hydrolysis is proportional to the total amount of AHL, given by $k_{\\text{hyd}} V A(t)$.\n\nCombining these terms into the mass balance equation:\n$$\nV \\frac{dA}{dt} = 0 - D V A(t) + \\frac{k_s X V}{N_A} - k_{\\text{hyd}} V A(t)\n$$\nThe volume $V$ is a common factor and can be canceled from all terms, yielding an equation for the concentration $A(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = \\frac{k_s X}{N_A} - D A(t) - k_{\\text{hyd}} A(t)\n$$\nWe must ensure consistent units. The rates $D$ and $k_{\\text{hyd}}$ are given in units of $\\text{h}^{-1}$, while the synthesis rate $k_s$ is in $\\text{molecules}\\,\\text{cell}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$. We must convert $k_s$ to an hourly rate. Let $C$ be the conversion factor, $C = 3600\\,\\text{s}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$. The hourly synthesis rate is $C k_s$. The correct differential equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = \\frac{C k_s X}{N_A} - (D + k_{\\text{hyd}}) A(t)\n$$\nThis is the ordinary differential equation governing $A(t)$.\n\nTo find the steady-state concentration, denoted as $A^*$, we set the time derivative to zero, $\\frac{dA}{dt} = 0$.\n$$\n0 = \\frac{C k_s X}{N_A} - (D + k_{\\text{hyd}}) A^*\n$$\nSolving for $A^*$:\n$$\n(D + k_{\\text{hyd}}) A^* = \\frac{C k_s X}{N_A}\n$$\n$$\nA^* = \\frac{C k_s X}{N_A (D + k_{\\text{hyd}})}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $D = 0.20\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$\n- $k_{\\text{hyd}} = 0.035\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$\n- $X = 1.0 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\text{cells}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$\n- $k_s = 25\\,\\text{molecules}\\,\\text{cell}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n- $N_A = 6.022 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$\n- $C = 3600\\,\\text{s}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$\n\nThe composite removal rate is $D + k_{\\text{hyd}} = 0.20\\,\\text{h}^{-1} + 0.035\\,\\text{h}^{-1} = 0.235\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$.\nThe hourly production rate per cell is $C k_s = (3600\\,\\text{s}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}) \\times (25\\,\\text{molecules}\\,\\text{cell}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) = 9.0 \\times 10^4\\,\\text{molecules}\\,\\text{cell}^{-1}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $A^*$:\n$$\nA^* = \\frac{(9.0 \\times 10^4\\,\\text{molecules}\\,\\text{cell}^{-1}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\text{cells}\\,\\text{L}^{-1})}{(6.022 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}) \\times (0.235\\,\\text{h}^{-1})}\n$$\nThe units are $(\\text{molecules}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}) / (\\text{molecules}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}) = \\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$, which is correct.\n\nCalculating the numerator:\n$$\n(9.0 \\times 10^4) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{12}) = 9.0 \\times 10^{16}\n$$\nCalculating the denominator:\n$$\n(6.022 \\times 10^{23}) \\times 0.235 \\approx 1.41517 \\times 10^{23}\n$$\nNow, the division:\n$$\nA^* = \\frac{9.0 \\times 10^{16}}{1.41517 \\times 10^{23}} \\,\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1} \\approx 6.3596 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in micromolar ($\\mu\\text{M}$), where $1\\,\\mu\\text{M} = 10^{-6}\\,\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$.\n$$\nA^* \\approx (6.3596 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}) \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mu\\text{M}}{10^{-6}\\,\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}} = 0.63596\\,\\mu\\text{M}\n$$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures, we obtain $A^* = 0.636\\,\\mu\\text{M}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.636}$$", "id": "2844067"}, {"introduction": "The perception of a quorum-sensing signal is mediated by specific receptor proteins, making these interactions a critical control point and a target for intervention.

The receptor, LuxR, can exist in one of three states: free $[R]$, bound to agonist $[RA]$, or bound to inhibitor $[RI]$.\nThus, the total concentration of LuxR monomers is:\n$$[R]_{total} = [R] + [RA] + [RI]$$\nThe fractional occupancy by the agonist $A$ is:\n$$\\theta_{A} = \\frac{[RA]}{[R]_{total}} = \\frac{[RA]}{[R] + [RA] + [RI]}$$\nThe problem provides the equilibrium dissociation constants for the agonist, $K_{A}$, and the inhibitor, $K_{I}$:\n$$K_{A} = \\frac{[R][A]}{[RA]}$$\n$$K_{I} = \\frac{[R][I]}{[RI]}$$\nWe can rearrange these equilibrium expressions to express the concentrations of the bound forms in terms of the free receptor concentration $[R]$:\n$$[RA] = \\frac{[R][A]}{K_{A}}$$\n$$[RI] = \\frac{[R][I]}{K_{I}}$$\nNow, we substitute these expressions back into the equation for $\\theta_{A}$:\n$$\\theta_{A} = \\frac{\\frac{[R][A]}{K_{A}}}{[R] + \\frac{[R][A]}{K_{A}} + \\frac{[R][I]}{K_{I}}}$$\nThe term for the free receptor concentration, $[R]$, is a common factor in all terms of the denominator and can be canceled with the $[R]$ in the numerator, yielding an expression for fractional occupancy that depends only on ligand concentrations and dissociation constants:\n$$\\theta_{A}([A],[I]) = \\frac{\\frac{[A]}{K_{A}}}{1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_{A}} + \\frac{[I]}{K_{I}}}$$\nThis expression correctly describes the fractional occupancy of a single binding site by an agonist in the presence of a competitive inhibitor.\n\nThe problem states that the normalized promoter activity, $f([A],[I])$, is proportional to $\\theta_{A}^{n}$, where $n$ is an effective Hill coefficient. Since the activity is normalized, its maximum value must be $1$. As $[A] \\to \\infty$, $\\theta_{A} \\to 1$, so $f_{max} = 1^{n} = 1$. This implies that the proportionality constant is $1$.
