The DDKR protein is only active when it forms a homodimer, a complex made of two identical DDKR protein units. The gene for DDKR undergoes a specific and well-characterized messenger RNA (mRNA) editing event where a single nucleotide is altered. This editing event produces a variant of the DDKR protein monomer that is completely non-functional, as it cannot bind to its target or form a stable dimer interface.\n\nExtensive sequencing has determined that this RNA editing process has an efficiency of 60.0%. This means that in the cellular pool of DDKR mRNA transcripts, 60.0% are edited, and the remaining are unedited. Assume that the protein monomers (both functional from unedited mRNA and non-functional from edited mRNA) are synthesized in direct proportion to the abundance of their respective transcripts and that they combine randomly to form dimers.\n\nCalculate the proportion of DDKR protein complexes that are fully functional within the cell. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the fraction of edited (nonfunctional) transcripts be $f_{e}=0.600$. Because protein synthesis is proportional to transcript abundance, the fraction of nonfunctional monomers is also $f_{e}=0.600$. The fraction of unedited (functional) monomers is therefore\n$$\nf_{u}=1-f_{e}=1-0.600=0.400.\n$$\nAssuming random combination into dimers, selecting the two monomers is independent. The possible pairings and their probabilities are $f_{u}^{2}$ (unedited–unedited), $2f_{u}f_{e}$ (heterodimer), and $f_{e}^{2}$ (edited–edited). Only the unedited–unedited dimer is fully functional. Hence, the proportion of fully functional dimers in the cellular pool is\n$$\nf_{\\text{functional}}=f_{u}^{2}=(0.400)^{2}=0.160.\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this remains $0.160$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.160}$$", "id": "1518594"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of editing efficiency, we now consider the combinatorial complexity that arises when multiple editing sites exist on transcripts encoding multimeric proteins.

The function of each subunit is critically dependent on post-transcriptional RNA editing. The messenger RNA (mRNA) coding for a subunit has two specific sites, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, that can be independently edited by Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes.\n\n1.  **Editing at Site $\\alpha$**: An Adenosine-to-Inosine (A-to-I) edit at this site results in a truncated, non-functional (NF) subunit. The probability of an mRNA molecule being edited at site $\\alpha$ is $p_{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n2.  **Editing at Site $\\beta$**: An A-to-I edit at this site, within the channel's pore-lining domain, alters ion selectivity. This edit is only relevant for functional subunits. If a functional subunit's mRNA is edited at site $\\beta$, it becomes selective for chloride ions (Cl-type). If it is not edited, it is selective for sodium ions (Na-type). The probability of an mRNA molecule being edited at site $\\beta$ is $p_{\\beta} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nA functional channel is assembled by randomly drawing four subunits from the pool of translated proteins. The operational characteristics of the assembled tetrameric channel are as follows:\n\n-   **Activation Rule**: The channel is active only if it contains at least three functional subunits.\n-   **Selectivity Rule**: For an active channel, its overall ion transport is determined by the majority of its constituent functional subunits. If there are strictly more Cl-type functional subunits than Na-type, the channel is $\\text{Cl}^{-}$-selective. If there are strictly more Na-type than Cl-type, it is $\\text{Na}^{+}$-selective. If there is an equal number of Cl-type and Na-type functional subunits, the channel is non-selective.\n\nAssuming the two editing events are statistically independent, calculate the probability that a newly assembled channel is both active and selective for chloride ions (Cl$^{-}$).
