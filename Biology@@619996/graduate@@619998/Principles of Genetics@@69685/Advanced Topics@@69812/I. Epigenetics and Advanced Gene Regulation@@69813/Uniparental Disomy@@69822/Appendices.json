This practice challenges you to derive, from first principles, the relationship between meiotic recombination and the likelihood of a specific UPD outcome, uniparental isodisomy, following a meiosis II error [@problem_id:2864712]. By working through this derivation, you will build a quantitative intuition for how events at the chromosomal level directly influence genetic risk.", "problem": "A heterozygous parent carries alleles $A$ and $a$ at a locus that lies at recombination fraction $r$ from the centromere on a single chromosome. Consider the following sequence of events: a meiosis II (MII) nondisjunction produces one gamete carrying two sister chromatids for this chromosome and another gamete nullisomic for this chromosome. The disomic gamete is fertilized by a normal haploid gamete from the other parent, creating a trisomic zygote at this chromosome. A single round of trisomy rescue occurs in the early embryo, and one of the three chromosomes is lost at random.\n\nUsing only the following fundamental principles and definitions:\n- During meiosis I, recombination occurs between homologous chromosomes; the parity (odd versus even) of crossovers between the centromere and the locus determines whether sister chromatids carry identical versus different alleles at the locus by meiosis II.\n- Meiosis II nondisjunction causes both sister chromatids of one homolog to co-segregate into the same gamete.\n- Trisomy rescue eliminates one of the three homologous chromosomes with equal probability, independently of their origin.\n- Uniparental disomy (UPD) refers to both copies being inherited from one parent; uniparental isodisomy is the special case in which the two copies are identical at the locus.\n\nAssume: (i) the nondisjoining parent is truly heterozygous at the locus, (ii) the recombination fraction $r$ is the probability that an odd number of crossovers occurred between the centromere and the locus in that meiosis (so that the two sister chromatids differ at the locus), (iii) no chromatid interference, no gene conversion, and no selection on which chromosome is lost during rescue, and (iv) recombination and nondisjunction events are independent.\n\nDerive, in closed form, the probability that the final disomic conceptus exhibits uniparental isodisomy at the locus after trisomy rescue, expressed as a function of $r$. Express your final answer as a single analytic expression in terms of $r$. No numerical approximation is required, and no units are needed.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the probability that a conceptus exhibits uniparental isodisomy (iUPD) for a specific locus. The mechanism involves a sequence of well-defined genetic events: recombination during meiosis in a heterozygous parent, meiosis II (MII) nondisjunction, fertilization by a normal gamete, and subsequent trisomy rescue. We will solve this by calculating the probability of each step in the causal chain that leads to the final state of iUPD.\n\nLet the heterozygous parent be denoted as Parent $1$, with genotype $A/a$ at the locus of interest. The homologous chromosomes carry alleles $A$ and $a$, respectively. After DNA replication prior to meiosis I, the cell contains a pair of homologous chromosomes, one consisting of two sister chromatids with allele $A$ and the other with two sister chromatids with allele $a$.\n\nThe state of the sister chromatids entering meiosis II depends on recombination events between the centromere and the locus during meiosis I. The problem defines the recombination fraction, $r$, as the probability of an odd number of crossovers occurring in this interval.\n\nCase $1$: An even number of crossovers (including zero) occurs between the centromere and the locus. The probability of this event is $1-r$. In this scenario, the sister chromatids of any given chromosome remain genetically identical at the locus. After segregation in meiosis I, a secondary meiocyte will receive a chromosome whose sister chromatids are either both $A$ or both $a$. Due to Mendelian segregation, the probability of receiving the chromosome with two $A$ chromatids is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of receiving the one with two $a$ chromatids is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nCase $2$: An odd number of crossovers occurs between the centromere and the locus. The probability of this event is $r$. This exchange results in sister chromatids that are no longer identical. After segregation in meiosis I, the secondary meiocyte receives a chromosome whose sister chromatids carry different alleles, one $A$ and one $a$.\n\nNext, a meiosis II nondisjunction event occurs. This means that the sister chromatids fail to separate and co-segregate into a single disomic gamete. We can determine the genotype of this gamete based on the two cases above. The probabilities are conditional on the MII nondisjunction event occurring.\n- If the secondary meiocyte's chromosome has identical sister chromatids (from Case $1$), the resulting disomic gamete will be either homozygous $A/A$ or $a/a$. The probability of forming an $A/A$ gamete is the probability of having an even crossover count and segregating the $A/A$ chromosome into the secondary meiocyte: $P(\\text{gamete is } A/A) = (1-r) \\times \\frac{1}{2}$. Similarly, $P(\\text{gamete is } a/a) = (1-r) \\times \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- If the secondary meiocyte's chromosome has non-identical sister chromatids (from Case $2$), the resulting disomic gamete will be heterozygous $A/a$. The probability for this is $P(\\text{gamete is } A/a) = r$.\nThe sum of these probabilities is $\\frac{1}{2}(1-r) + \\frac{1}{2}(1-r) + r = 1-r+r = 1$, as expected.\n\nThis disomic gamete from Parent $1$ is fertilized by a normal, haploid gamete from a second parent. Let the allele from the second parent be denoted by $p$. This fertilization results in a trisomic zygote. The possible genotypes of the trisomic zygote and their corresponding probabilities are:\n- Zygote genotype $A/A/p$: This occurs if the gamete from Parent $1$ was $A/A$. The probability is $\\frac{1}{2}(1-r)$.\n- Zygote genotype $a/a/p$: This occurs if the gamete from Parent $1$ was $a/a$. The probability is $\\frac{1}{2}(1-r)$.\n- Zygote genotype $A/a/p$: This occurs if the gamete from Parent $1$ was $A/a$. The probability is $r$.\n\nThe final step is trisomy rescue, where one of the three homologous chromosomes is lost with equal probability, $\\frac{1}{3}$. For uniparental disomy (UPD) to occur, the chromosome originating from the second parent (carrying allele $p$) must be the one that is lost. The probability of this specific loss is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nWe are interested in the outcome of uniparental **isodisomy** (iUPD), which is a form of UPD where the two retained chromosomes are identical copies. We analyze the consequence of losing the chromosome with allele $p$ for each type of trisomic zygote:\n- Starting with zygote $A/A/p$ (prob. $\\frac{1}{2}(1-r)$): If the chromosome with $p$ is lost (prob. $\\frac{1}{3}$), the resulting diploid embryo has genotype $A/A$. This is iUPD. The probability of this entire pathway is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(1-r)\\right) \\times \\frac{1}{3}$.\n- Starting with zygote $a/a/p$ (prob. $\\frac{1}{2}(1-r)$): If the chromosome with $p$ is lost (prob. $\\frac{1}{3}$), the resulting diploid embryo has genotype $a/a$. This is also iUPD. The probability of this pathway is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(1-r)\\right) \\times \\frac{1}{3}$.\n- Starting with zygote $A/a/p$ (prob. $r$): If the chromosome with $p$ is lost (prob. $\\frac{1}{3}$), the resulting embryo has genotype $A/a$. This is uniparental **hetero**disomy, not isodisomy. Therefore, this pathway does not contribute to the probability of iUPD.\n\nThe total probability of uniparental isodisomy, $P(\\text{iUPD})$, is the sum of the probabilities of the mutually exclusive pathways that result in iUPD.\n$$P(\\text{iUPD}) = \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(1-r) \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(1-r) \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\right)$$\n$$P(\\text{iUPD}) = 2 \\times \\left( \\frac{1-r}{6} \\right)$$\n$$P(\\text{iUPD}) = \\frac{1-r}{3}$$\nThis expression gives the probability of observing uniparental isodisomy for the locus as a function of the recombination fraction $r$ between the centromere and the locus, under the specified conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1-r}{3}}$$", "id": "2864712"}, {"introduction": "Translating theoretical knowledge into diagnostic skill is a cornerstone of modern genetics. This problem presents a common clinical scenario where you must interpret genomic data to distinguish between two distinct causes of extensive homozygosity: uniparental isodisomy and consanguinity [@problem_id:2864691]. By analyzing the distribution of runs of homozygosity, you will learn to recognize the unique genomic signatures left by a single chromosomal mis-segregation event versus a shared family history.", "problem": "A clinical genetics laboratory is asked to interpret single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray data from two unrelated probands with developmental delay when parental genotypes are unavailable. The laboratory uses copy-number neutral measures to detect long stretches of homozygous genotypes, commonly termed runs of homozygosity (ROH), and examines B-allele frequency (BAF) patterns. The goal is to determine whether the observed patterns are more consistent with consanguinity (autozygosity due to recent common ancestry) or uniparental disomy (UPD; inheritance of both homologs of a chromosome from a single parent).\n\nFoundational principles to consider include the following: Mendelian segregation (each gamete receives one allele from each parental pair), independent assortment (nonhomologous chromosomes segregate independently), meiotic recombination (homologous chromosomes exchange segments each meiosis, creating mosaic haplotypes), and identity-by-descent (IBD) resulting in autozygosity in the offspring when both alleles descend from the same ancestral allele with probability equal to the inbreeding coefficient $F$. In humans, recombination creates multiple crossovers per chromosome per meiosis, which breaks ancestral haplotypes into segments distributed across many chromosomes over generations. By contrast, UPD originates from a single-chromosome mis-segregation event (for example, trisomy rescue, monosomy rescue, or postzygotic mitotic recombination), and can produce whole-chromosome or segmental isodisomy (copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity) in the affected chromosome while the remainder of the genome retains biparental inheritance.\n\nThe laboratory observes the following:\n\n- Proband $1$: Total genomic proportion in ROH is $6.2\\%$, comprising $18$ ROH segments ranging from $5$ to $22\\,\\mathrm{Mb}$ distributed across $12$ different chromosomes. Outside the ROH, the BAF shows abundant heterozygous genotypes. Copy-number is diploid throughout.\n- Proband $2$: A single chromosome shows copy-neutral absence of heterozygosity across essentially its full length (approximately $150\\,\\mathrm{Mb}$), with BAF consistent with only homozygous genotype clusters on that chromosome. The remainder of the genome shows negligible ROH and abundant heterozygosity. Copy-number is diploid throughout.\n\nWhich option best explains, from first principles, why ROH due to consanguinity are typically distributed across multiple chromosomes, whereas UPD-related homozygosity is confined to one chromosome or a contiguous segment, and appropriately assigns the likely etiology for each proband?\n\nA. In recent consanguinity (for example, parents who are first cousins with inbreeding coefficient $F \\approx 1/16$), meiotic recombination shuffles ancestral haplotypes each generation, so IBD segments manifest as multiple ROH scattered across many chromosomes totaling roughly $F$ of the genome; by contrast, UPD arises from a mis-segregation affecting a single chromosome, so homozygosity is confined to that chromosome or a segment thereof. Proband $1$ is consistent with consanguinity; Proband $2$ is consistent with UPD involving one chromosome.\n\nB. Consanguinity most often produces a single long ROH on one chromosome because identical-by-descent tends to localize, while UPD creates many ROH across the genome due to parent-of-origin imprinting effects. Proband $1$ is UPD; Proband $2$ is consanguinity.\n\nC. Both consanguinity and UPD generate genome-wide ROH with similar distributions; the only discriminant is that the total ROH percentage is higher in UPD. Proband $1$ and Proband $2$ cannot be distinguished without parental data.\n\nD. Multi-chromosomal ROH usually indicates postzygotic mitotic recombination mosaicism rather than consanguinity; UPD always produces a trisomic copy-number state on the involved chromosome. Proband $1$ is mosaic for mitotic recombination; Proband $2$ has trisomy.\n\nE. Consanguinity and UPD are indistinguishable from SNP array ROH patterns without parental genotypes because both eliminate heterozygosity; therefore, no inference can be made about Proband $1$ or Proband $2$.", "solution": "The problem statement will now be subjected to rigorous validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Topic**: Differentiating consanguinity from uniparental disomy (UPD) using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray data.\n- **Data types**: Copy-number neutral measures, runs of homozygosity (ROH), B-allele frequency (BAF).\n- **Goal**: Determine the etiology (consanguinity vs. UPD) for two probands based on observed ROH and BAF patterns.\n- **Foundational Principles**:\n    - Mendelian segregation.\n    - Independent assortment.\n    - Meiotic recombination.\n    - Identity-by-descent (IBD) leading to autozygosity, with probability equal to the inbreeding coefficient $F$.\n    - UPD origin: single-chromosome mis-segregation (e.g., trisomy rescue, monosomy rescue, postzygotic mitotic recombination) leading to whole-chromosome or segmental isodisomy.\n- **Proband 1 Data**:\n    - Total genomic proportion in ROH: $6.2\\%$.\n    - Number of ROH segments: $18$.\n    - Size range of ROH segments: $5$ to $22\\,\\mathrm{Mb}$.\n    - Chromosomal distribution: spread across $12$ different chromosomes.\n    - Genome outside ROH: abundant heterozygous genotypes.\n    - Copy number: diploid throughout.\n- **Proband 2 Data**:\n    - A single chromosome shows copy-neutral absence of heterozygosity across its full length (approximately $150\\,\\mathrm{Mb}$).\n    - BAF consistent with only homozygous genotype clusters on that chromosome.\n    - Remainder of genome: negligible ROH and abundant heterozygosity.\n    - Copy number: diploid throughout.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly rooted in established principles of human and clinical genetics. The concepts of ROH, UPD, consanguinity, IBD, inbreeding coefficient ($F$), and their detection via SNP microarrays are standard in the field. The described mechanisms (meiotic recombination, chromosomal mis-segregation) are factually correct. The data provided for both probands are realistic and represent classic patterns observed in clinical practice.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It presents distinct data patterns for two cases and asks for an interpretation based on a provided set of fundamental principles. A unique and logical conclusion can be derived for each case.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, technical language. The data are quantitative and objective (e.g., $6.2\\%$, $18$ segments, $150\\,\\mathrm{Mb}$). There is no subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n4.  **Completeness**: The problem provides sufficient information to distinguish between the two proposed etiologies. The contrast between a genome-wide distribution of multiple ROH and a single-chromosome event is the key information, and it is clearly provided.\n5.  **Consistency**: The givens are internally consistent. For example, the statement that copy number is diploid throughout for Proband $2$ is consistent with UPD resulting from trisomy rescue, a known mechanism.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Derivation\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding how different genetic mechanisms generate distinct genomic patterns of homozygosity. We must analyze consanguinity and uniparental disomy from first principles.\n\n**Consanguinity and Identity-by-Descent (IBD)**\nConsanguinity refers to the mating of individuals who are related by recent common ancestry. An offspring of such a union has a non-zero probability of inheriting two copies of a chromosomal segment from a single ancestor through both the maternal and paternal lines. These segments are termed identical-by-descent (IBD). The regions of the genome that are IBD will appear as runs of homozygosity (ROH).\n\nThe key process that shapes the pattern of IBD segments is meiotic recombination. In each generation, a mandatory process of recombination (crossing-over) occurs, breaking up the parental chromosomes. For example, consider first cousins. Their common ancestors are their grandparents. There are at least two generations of meiosis separating the cousins from their common grandparents. Each meiosis shuffles the ancestral haplotypes. Consequently, the IBD segments inherited by their child will be numerous and distributed randomly across multiple chromosomes. The total fraction of the genome expected to be IBD is given by the inbreeding coefficient, $F$. For first cousins, the parents of the proband, $F = 1/16$, which is $0.0625$ or $6.25\\%$.\n\n**Uniparental Disomy (UPD)**\nUPD is the inheritance of two homologous chromosomes, or segments thereof, from a single parent. This is not a population-level phenomenon like consanguinity but an error occurring during gametogenesis or early embryonic development, typically affecting a single chromosome pair. A common mechanism is trisomy rescue, where a zygote is initially trisomic for a certain chromosome. To restore the correct diploid number of $46$ chromosomes, the cell may eject one of the three homologs. There is a $1/3$ chance that the two remaining chromosomes originate from the same parent. If these two chromosomes are identical (e.g., from a meiosis II error or post-fertilization duplication), the result is whole-chromosome uniparental *isodisomy*. This manifests as a complete absence of heterozygosity across the entire length of the affected chromosome, which is a massive, single ROH. If the two non-identical homologous chromosomes from one parent are retained (from a meiosis I error), the result is uniparental *heterodisomy*, which largely preserves heterozygosity and is not detectable as a simple ROH. The problem describes an absence of heterozygosity, which points to isodisomy. Critically, the event is confined to the specific chromosome involved in the initial aneuploidy. The rest of the genome has a normal biparental inheritance pattern with typical heterozygosity.\n\n**Analysis of Proband 1**\n- The proband exhibits multiple ROH ($18$ segments).\n- These ROH are distributed across many different chromosomes ($12$ of them).\n- The total proportion of the genome in ROH is $6.2\\%$. This value is remarkably close to the theoretical inbreeding coefficient for a child of first cousins ($F = 1/16 = 6.25\\%$).\n- This pattern—multiple, scattered ROH across the genome summing to a fraction consistent with a specific degree of relatedness—is the classic signature of consanguinity. The multiple ROH are the result of ancestral IBD segments being broken up by generations of meiotic recombination.\n- Therefore, the most logical explanation for Proband $1$ is consanguinity.\n\n**Analysis of Proband 2**\n- The proband exhibits a single, massive ROH spanning an entire chromosome (approximately $150\\,\\mathrm{Mb}$).\n- The rest of the genome shows normal heterozygosity and negligible ROH.\n- The state is copy-number neutral (diploid).\n- This pattern—homozygosity restricted to a single chromosome while the rest of the genome is unaffected—is the classic signature of whole-chromosome uniparental isodisomy (UPD). It cannot be explained by consanguinity, which would affect the entire genome with scattered ROH.\n- Therefore, the most logical explanation for Proband $2$ is UPD.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. In recent consanguinity (for example, parents who are first cousins with inbreeding coefficient $F \\approx 1/16$), meiotic recombination shuffles ancestral haplotypes each generation, so IBD segments manifest as multiple ROH scattered across many chromosomes totaling roughly $F$ of the genome; by contrast, UPD arises from a mis-segregation affecting a single chromosome, so homozygosity is confined to that chromosome or a segment thereof. Proband $1$ is consistent with consanguinity; Proband $2$ is consistent with UPD involving one chromosome.**\nThis option correctly describes the genetic mechanisms and their genomic consequences. It correctly explains that recombination in consanguineous pedigrees leads to multiple, scattered ROH. It correctly states that UPD is a single-chromosome event. The assignments for Proband $1$ (consanguinity) and Proband $2$ (UPD) are consistent with our derivation.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Consanguinity most often produces a single long ROH on one chromosome because identical-by-descent tends to localize, while UPD creates many ROH across the genome due to parent-of-origin imprinting effects. Proband $1$ is UPD; Proband $2$ is consanguinity.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. Consanguinity results in multiple ROH across the genome due to recombination, not a single long one. UPD results in homozygosity on a single chromosome, not many ROH across the genome. Parent-of-origin imprinting is a consequence of UPD for certain chromosomes, not the cause of the ROH pattern. The assignments are inverted based on incorrect premises.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Both consanguinity and UPD generate genome-wide ROH with similar distributions; the only discriminant is that the total ROH percentage is higher in UPD. Proband $1$ and Proband $2$ cannot be distinguished without parental data.**\nThis is factually incorrect. The distributions are not similar; they are characteristically different. The primary discriminant is exactly the distribution (genome-wide vs. single-chromosome), not the total percentage. The statement that they cannot be distinguished is false; SNP microarray data alone is often sufficient, as demonstrated in this problem.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Multi-chromosomal ROH usually indicates postzygotic mitotic recombination mosaicism rather than consanguinity; UPD always produces a trisomic copy-number state on the involved chromosome. Proband $1$ is mosaic for mitotic recombination; Proband $2$ has trisomy.**\nThis statement contains multiple errors. Firstly, while mosaic mitotic recombination can cause ROH, the pattern in Proband $1$ ($6.2\\%$ of the genome across $12$ chromosomes) is the canonical signature for first-cousin level consanguinity, not sporadic mosaicism. Secondly, and more critically, UPD does *not* always produce a trisomic state. By definition, UPD is a *disomic* condition. It is often the *result* of resolving a trisomy, leading to a copy-number neutral (diploid) state. The problem explicitly states Proband $2$ is diploid, contradicting the claim of trisomy.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Consanguinity and UPD are indistinguishable from SNP array ROH patterns without parental genotypes because both eliminate heterozygosity; therefore, no inference can be made about Proband $1$ or Proband $2$.**\nThis statement is a defeatist and incorrect generalization. While both phenomena can cause loss of heterozygosity, the *patterns* of that loss are highly informative and, in classic cases like these, clearly distinguishable. The premise that they are indistinguishable is false, which invalidates the conclusion that no inference can be made.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2864691"}, {"introduction": "The clinical significance of uniparental disomy is most profound for imprinted chromosomes, where the parent of origin dictates gene expression.

Established principles are that for a typical biparental conception the proband inherits one allele from each parent at each autosomal locus and shows approximately $50\\%$ methylation at the SNRPN ICR because the maternal allele is methylated and the paternal allele is unmethylated. In uniparental disomy (UPD), both homologs are inherited from a single parent, violating Mendelian segregation on the affected chromosome, and the methylation pattern at the SNRPN ICR shifts toward a single-parent pattern.\n\nUsing these two data types only, you wish to discriminate among the following outcomes for chromosome $15$q$11$-$q$13$: maternal Uniparental Disomy (UPD), paternal UPD, and biparental inheritance with an imprinting defect at the SNRPN ICR.

Step $2$: Interrogate trio SNP genotypes across chromosome $15$ to detect uniparental inheritance; if present, call UPD without specifying maternal or paternal.", "solution": "Begin from first principles relevant to chromosome $15$q$11$-$q$13$:\n\n- Mendelian segregation predicts that a proband inherits one allele from each parent on autosomes. Trio SNP genotyping across a chromosome should therefore show biparental transmission: at informative loci, at least one allele derives from the mother and one from the father. In uniparental disomy (UPD), both homologs derive from a single parent, violating these expectations on the affected chromosome: across informative loci one observes exclusive transmission from one parent, with patterns of isodisomy (long runs of homozygosity) and/or heterodisomy (phased transmission of both homologs from the same parent) detectable in trios.\n\n- Genomic imprinting at the SNRPN Imprinting Control Region (ICR) is parent-of-origin specific: the maternal allele is methylated and the paternal allele is unmethylated. For a typical biparental conception, the methylation array therefore measures approximately $50\\%$ methylation (one methylated allele of two). If both alleles are maternal in origin (maternal UPD), the SNRPN ICR appears hypermethylated, near $100\\%$. If both alleles are paternal in origin (paternal UPD), it appears hypomethylated, near $0\\%$. Crucially, an imprinting defect at the SNRPN ICR can also yield near $100\\%$ or near $0\\%$ methylation despite biparental inheritance in the trio genotypes.\n\nDerivation of the required decision logic:\n\n- Methylation at SNRPN ICR is the most direct readout of imprinting status at $15$q$11$-$q$13$. Therefore, start by asking whether imprinting at this locus is normal (approximately $50\\%$) or abnormal (near $0\\%$ or near $100\\%$). A normal value makes both UPD and locus-specific imprinting defects unlikely and supports biparental inheritance with normal imprinting at this locus, so no further steps are needed for the three targeted categories.\n\n- If methylation is abnormal, two biologically distinct explanations remain: UPD of chromosome $15$ (maternal or paternal) or a biparental conception with an imprinting defect (for example, an epimutation or a small Imprinting Control Region lesion) restricted to this locus. Methylation alone cannot distinguish these. Trio SNP genotypes across chromosome $15$ can, because UPD produces exclusive parent-of-origin transmission across the chromosome, whereas a biparental imprinting defect preserves Mendelian biparental inheritance.\n\n- Once UPD is established by trio genotypes, the parent of origin is determined by which parent’s alleles are exclusively transmitted across chromosome $15$. The methylation polarity (near $100\\%$ versus near $0\\%$) is concordant with maternal versus paternal origin, respectively, but the decisive separation between UPD and biparental imprinting defect requires integrating the trio genotypes.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This option adheres to the above derivation. Step $1$ uses SNRPN ICR methylation to detect abnormal imprinting at the relevant locus. If normal (approximately $50\\%$), the case falls outside the three targeted abnormal categories and can be concluded. If abnormal (near $0\\%$ or near $100\\%$), Step $2$ uses trio SNP genotypes across chromosome $15$ to discriminate UPD from biparental inheritance with an imprinting defect: exclusive maternal transmission implies maternal UPD; exclusive paternal transmission implies paternal UPD; biparental transmission with abnormal methylation implies a biparental imprinting defect. This cleanly and minimally separates the three requested categories. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. This option begins with trio genotypes to identify UPD, which is a reasonable starting point, but then immediately classifies any biparental transmission as normal and stops without consulting methylation. That will systematically miss biparental cases with an imprinting defect (which have biparental genotypes but abnormal methylation). Thus it fails to discriminate the biparental imprinting defect category. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. This option relies solely on methylation to assign all categories. While methylation polarity correlates with parent-of-origin in UPD, methylation alone cannot distinguish UPD from biparental imprinting defects, because both can produce near $0\\%$ or near $100\\%$ methylation. It will misclassify biparental imprinting defects as UPD and ignore the trio data entirely. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. This option treats any abnormal methylation as an imprinting defect and only queries genotypes when methylation is normal. That inverts the required logic: it will misclassify all UPD cases (which show abnormal methylation) as imprinting defects and, even when it detects UPD under normal methylation (a scenario that should not arise for SNRPN ICR if the assay is working), it fails to specify maternal versus paternal UPD. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, only option A provides a correct, minimal decision tree that integrates methylation status with trio inheritance to unambiguously discriminate maternal UPD, paternal UPD, and biparental inheritance with an imprinting defect at chromosome $15$q$11$-$q$13$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2864690"}]}
