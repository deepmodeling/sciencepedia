This exercise uses the foundational genetic experiment—the reciprocal cross—to quantitatively demonstrate the parent-of-origin effect on phenotype.

The concept of genomic imprinting, parent-of-origin specific gene expression, and its mechanism via cytosine methylation are established principles in genetics. The use of reciprocal crosses to reveal parent-of-origin effects is a standard experimental design. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information regarding genotypes, allele effects, imprinting status, and inheritance patterns to deduce a unique outcome. The problem statement is objective and uses precise, unambiguous terminology. It does not violate any fundamental scientific laws, is not based on false premises, and contains no contradictions. It is a formal problem in transmission genetics that is directly relevant to its topic.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be developed.\n\nThe core principle governing the phenotype of the offspring is the rule of genomic imprinting stated in the problem: only the paternally inherited allele is expressed. The maternally inherited allele is transcriptionally silent and, therefore, does not contribute to the phenotype, regardless of whether it is allele $A$ or $a$. The phenotype is determined solely by the genotype of the paternal gamete.\n\nLet us analyze the first cross, $\\mathcal{C}_1$.\nThe parents are an $A/a$ female and an $a/a$ male.\nThe female parent (genotype $A/a$) produces two classes of gametes (ova) in equal proportions due to Mendelian segregation: $1/2$ of the ova carry the $A$ allele and $1/2$ carry the $a$ allele.\nThe male parent (genotype $a/a$) produces only one class of gamete (sperm): all sperm carry the $a$ allele.\nThe resulting offspring genotypes are determined by the fusion of these gametes:\n- An ovum carrying $A$ fertilized by a sperm carrying $a$ results in an offspring with genotype $A/a$. The proportion of these offspring is $1/2$.\n- An ovum carrying $a$ fertilized by a sperm carrying $a$ results in an offspring with genotype $a/a$. The proportion of these offspring is $1/2$.\nThus, the expected genotypic ratio in the offspring of $\\mathcal{C}_1$ is $1:1$ for $A/a:a/a$.\n\nTo determine the phenotypes, we apply the imprinting rule. The phenotype is dictated by the expressed paternal allele.\n- For the $A/a$ offspring, the paternally inherited allele is $a$. The maternal allele $A$ is silenced. Since the expressed allele is $a$, the phenotype is wild-type (no $P$).\n- For the $a/a$ offspring, the paternally inherited allele is $a$. The maternal allele $a$ is silenced. The expressed allele is $a$, so the phenotype is wild-type (no $P$).\nTherefore, in cross $\\mathcal{C}_1$, all ($100\\%$) of the offspring are of the wild-type phenotype. The expected phenotypic ratio is $1$ wild-type to $0$ phenotype $P$. The proportion of offspring expressing phenotype $P$ is $0$.\n\nNext, we analyze the reciprocal cross, $\\mathcal{C}_2$.\nThe parents are an $a/a$ female and an $A/a$ male.\nThe female parent (genotype $a/a$) produces only one class of gamete: all ova carry the $a$ allele.\nThe male parent (genotype $A/a$) produces two classes of gametes (sperm) in equal proportions: $1/2$ of the sperm carry the $A$ allele and $1/2$ carry the $a$ allele.\nThe resulting offspring genotypes are:\n- An ovum carrying $a$ fertilized by a sperm carrying $A$ results in an offspring with genotype $a/A$. The proportion of these offspring is $1/2$.\n- An ovum carrying $a$ fertilized by a sperm carrying $a$ results in an offspring with genotype $a/a$. The proportion of these offspring is $1/2$.\nThe expected genotypic ratio in the offspring of $\\mathcal{C}_2$ is $1:1$ for $a/A:a/a$.\n\nTo determine the phenotypes for $\\mathcal{C}_2$, we again apply the imprinting rule.\n- For the $a/A$ offspring, the paternally inherited allele is $A$. The maternal allele $a$ is silenced. Since the expressed allele is the gain-of-function $A$, the phenotype is $P$.\n- For the $a/a$ offspring, the paternally inherited allele is $a$. The maternal allele $a$ is silenced. The expressed allele is $a$, so the phenotype is wild-type (no $P$).\nTherefore, in cross $\\mathcal{C}_2$, $1/2$ of the offspring exhibit phenotype $P$ and $1/2$ are of the wild-type phenotype. The expected phenotypic ratio is $1$ phenotype $P$ to $1$ wild-type. The proportion of offspring expressing phenotype $P$ is $1/2$.\n\nThe deviation from standard Mendelian expectations is profound. In the absence of imprinting, given that $A$ is dominant, a standard test cross between a heterozygote ($A/a$) and a homozygous recessive ($a/a$) is expected to yield a $1:1$ phenotypic ratio of dominant to recessive phenotypes, irrespective of which parent is the heterozygote. Thus, standard Mendelian genetics would predict that both $\\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\\mathcal{C}_2$ yield offspring with a $1/2$ proportion of phenotype $P$. However, due to imprinting, the outcomes of the reciprocal crosses are non-equivalent. Cross $\\mathcal{C}_1$ produces $0\\%$ offspring with phenotype $P$, while cross $\\mathcal{C}_2$ produces $50\\%$ offspring with phenotype $P$. This non-equivalence of reciprocal crosses is the hallmark of parent-of-origin effects such as genomic imprinting.\n\nFinally, we compute the required absolute difference.\nLet $p_1$ be the expected proportion of phenotype $P$ from cross $\\mathcal{C}_1$, and $p_2$ be the expected proportion of phenotype $P$ from cross $\\mathcal{C}_2$.\nFrom our analysis, $p_1 = 0$ and $p_2 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe absolute difference is $|p_2 - p_1| = \\left|\\frac{1}{2} - 0\\right| = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe result is a reduced fraction as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "2818984"}, {"introduction": "A core consequence of genomic imprinting is that it renders diploid organisms functionally haploid for imprinted genes in specific tissues.

The concepts of allele-specific methylation, monoallelic expression, loss-of-function mutations, and gene dosage are fundamental in genetics. The scenario presented is a standard model used to understand the consequences of imprinting.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear genetic system, defines all parameters and probabilities ($p = \\frac{1}{2}$), normalizes the dosage ($D_{\\mathrm{WT}} = 1$), and specifies explicit assumptions (complete silencing, no compensation). These elements ensure that a unique and meaningful solution can be derived.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, unbiased scientific language. Terms are standard within the field of genetics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically valid, self-contained, and well-posed. It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe solution is addressed in two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we must justify why genomic imprinting renders the gene $G$ functionally haploid. A diploid organism possesses two alleles for each autosomal gene, one inherited from the mother and one from the father. Gene dosage, which is the quantity of functional gene product, typically arises from the transcription and translation of both alleles. The central dogma of molecular biology dictates this flow from DNA to RNA to protein. However, the phenomenon of genomic imprinting introduces an epigenetic modification, such as DNA methylation and repressive histone marks, on one of the parental alleles. In the case of gene $G$, the maternally inherited allele is specified as being epigenetically silenced. This silencing prevents its transcription. Consequently, only the paternally inherited allele is expressed, a condition known as monoallelic expression. Although the organism is genetically diploid, carrying two physical copies of gene $G$, it is functionally haploid with respect to this gene in tissues where the imprinting occurs. This is because all of the gene's functional product, and thus its entire contribution to the phenotype, originates from a single active copy.\n\nSecond, we compute the expected proportional decrease in dosage. Let $D$ be the random variable for the total dosage in the heterozygous offspring. The wild-type dosage is given as $D_{\\mathrm{WT}} = 1$. A de novo, fully penetrant loss-of-function mutation occurs. We must consider the two possible locations for this mutated allele.\n\nLet $G^M$ and $G^P$ represent the maternally and paternally inherited alleles, respectively. Let $g$ denote the loss-of-function mutant allele.\n\nThere are two mutually exclusive scenarios for the genotype of the heterozygous offspring:\n\nScenario 1: The mutation lies on the paternally inherited chromosome.\nThe genotype is $(G^M, g^P)$.\nThe probability of this scenario is given as $p = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe dosage from the maternal allele, $G^M$, is $0$ due to imprinting-mediated silencing.\nThe dosage from the paternal allele, $g^P$, is $0$ because it is a loss-of-function mutant.\nThe total dosage in this case, $D_1$, is $0 + 0 = 0$.\n\nScenario 2: The mutation lies on the maternally inherited chromosome.\nThe genotype is $(g^M, G^P)$.\nThe probability of this scenario is $1 - p = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe dosage from the maternal allele, $g^M$, is $0$. This is due to imprinting-mediated silencing; the fact that the allele is also mutated is irrelevant to its transcriptional status.\nThe dosage from the paternal allele, $G^P$, is $1$, as it is the wild-type, active allele.\nThe total dosage in this case, $D_2$, is $0 + 1 = 1$.\n\nThe expected dosage, $E[D]$, is the sum of the outcomes weighted by their respective probabilities:\n$$E[D] = D_1 \\cdot p + D_2 \\cdot (1 - p)$$\nSubstituting the values we have determined:\n$$E[D] = (0) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + (1) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 0 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the expected proportional decrease in dosage relative to the wild-type dosage, $D_{\\mathrm{WT}}$.\nThe absolute decrease is $D_{\\mathrm{WT}} - E[D]$.\nThe proportional decrease is therefore $\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{WT}} - E[D]}{D_{\\mathrm{WT}}}$.\nGiven $D_{\\mathrm{WT}} = 1$ and $E[D] = \\frac{1}{2}$, we compute:\n$$\\text{Proportional Decrease} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{2}}{1} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{1} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThus, the expected proportional decrease in dosage is $\\frac{1}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "2818969"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond the 'what' to the 'how' of imprinting, this problem challenges you to think like a molecular geneticist dissecting an imprinting control region (ICR).

Furthermore, this practice emphasizes the importance of experimental validation by asking you to propose a suite of modern molecular assays to test your predictions, bridging the gap between theoretical models and laboratory practice.", "problem": "A mouse imprinted locus contains two reciprocally regulated genes, denoted here as $G_1$ (analogous to insulin-like growth factor $2$) and $G_2$ (analogous to $H19$), controlled by a single imprinting control region (ICR) situated between a distal enhancer and the promoters of $G_1$ and $G_2$. In wild type, the following well-established principles apply:\n\n- Genomic imprinting is a parent-of-origin-dependent epigenetic phenomenon in which one parental allele is transcriptionally silent while the other is active, established in the gametes by DNA methylation at differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and maintained after fertilization by maintenance DNA methyltransferases.\n- The ICR is hypomethylated on the maternal allele and hypermethylated on the paternal allele. On the maternal allele, the hypomethylated ICR recruits CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), forming an insulator that blocks enhancer–$G_1$ interactions, thereby permitting $G_2$ expression and repressing $G_1$. On the paternal allele, DNA methylation prevents CTCF binding; the enhancer contacts $G_1$, which is expressed, while $G_2$ is silenced by promoter-proximal methylation at a secondary DMR.\n- Thus, in a typical somatic tissue that exhibits imprinting at this locus, $G_1$ is expressed paternally (monoallelic) and $G_2$ is expressed maternally (monoallelic).\n\nA CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)/Cas9-mediated deletion is engineered to remove a minimal ICR segment of length $1.2\\ \\mathrm{kb}$ that contains $4$ high-affinity CTCF motifs and a dense CpG cluster but does not remove the $G_1$ or $G_2$ promoters or the distal enhancer. The deletion is heterozygous. Reciprocal $F_1$ crosses between two mouse strains with informative single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) allow phase-resolved, allele-specific analysis when the deletion is inherited maternally versus paternally.\n\nBased only on the fundamental definitions above (parent-of-origin-specific DNA methylation at the ICR, CTCF-dependent enhancer insulation on the unmethylated maternal allele, enhancer access to $G_1$ on the methylated paternal allele, and maintenance of secondary DMRs), select the option that best predicts the transcriptional outcome of the minimal ICR deletion on maternal versus paternal chromosomes in somatic tissues that normally show imprinting at this locus, and proposes appropriate assays to confirm loss of imprinting and its epigenetic basis.\n\nA. Maternal ICR deletion abolishes CTCF insulation in cis and “paternalizes” the maternal allele, yielding near-biallelic $G_1$ expression with reduction or silencing of $G_2$; paternal ICR deletion has minimal effect on steady-state $G_1$/$G_2$ expression because the paternal allele was already CTCF-free and enhancer-accessible. Confirm by allele-specific RNA sequencing or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) across SNPs in reciprocal $F_1$ tissues to detect biallelic $G_1$ and loss of maternal $G_2$, CTCF chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) to show loss of binding specifically on the maternal deleted allele, targeted bisulfite sequencing of the $G_2$ promoter DMR to verify retention of paternal-specific methylation and maternal hypomethylation, and circularized chromosome conformation capture (4C) or high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) to demonstrate increased enhancer–$G_1$ contacts on the maternally deleted chromosome.\n\nB. Maternal ICR deletion has no effect because $G_1$ is already off on the maternal allele; paternal ICR deletion “maternalizes” the paternal allele, causing near-biallelic $G_2$ expression with silencing of $G_1$. Confirm by measuring total (non-allele-specific) messenger RNA by quantitative PCR only, without reciprocal crosses or allele-specificity.\n\nC. Both maternal and paternal ICR deletions cause simultaneous biallelic expression of both $G_1$ and $G_2$ due to global loss of methylation at the ICR. Confirm by methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digest at the deleted ICR followed by Southern blot.\n\nD. Maternal ICR deletion causes uniform pre-implantation lethality due to complete disruption of imprinting at the locus, precluding transcriptional analysis; paternal ICR deletion causes a $50\\%$ reduction in $G_1$ with no change in $G_2$. Confirm by Western blotting of $G_1$ protein only, without allele-specific analysis or DNA methylation assays.", "solution": "We begin from core definitions and well-tested facts about genomic imprinting and insulator function:\n\n- Genomic imprinting is established by parent-of-origin-specific DNA methylation during gametogenesis at imprinting control regions (ICRs) and is maintained after fertilization by DNA methyltransferase $1$ and allied factors. This methylation is read by binding proteins that modulate chromatin and transcription, giving monoallelic expression.\n- At loci like $H19$/$Igf2$, the ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele. Unmethylated maternal ICR recruits CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), which acts as an enhancer-blocking insulator, preventing distal enhancers from activating $Igf2$-like genes ($G_1$) and thereby favoring expression of $H19$-like genes ($G_2$). Methylation on the paternal ICR prevents CTCF binding, allowing enhancer access to $G_1$, while a secondary DMR at the $G_2$ promoter is methylated and silences $G_2$ in cis.\n- Deleting the minimal ICR region that contains the CTCF motifs and CpG cluster removes the sequence necessary for CTCF binding and for the methylation-sensitive readout at that specific element, while leaving promoters and enhancers intact.\n\nFrom these principles, we predict cis effects of the deletion inherited from each parent:\n\n- Maternal deletion: In wild type, the maternal allele is unmethylated at the ICR, binds CTCF, and blocks enhancer–$G_1$ contact. If we delete the minimal ICR sequence, there is no substrate for CTCF, so insulation cannot occur. The maternal allele now lacks the enhancer block and should behave like the paternal allele with respect to enhancer access: enhancers can contact $G_1$. Therefore, $G_1$ becomes expressed from both the paternal and the maternal chromosomes (near-biallelic $G_1$), often approximating a $2$-fold increase relative to wild type, subject to dosage compensation limits. For $G_2$, maternal expression normally depends on enhancer availability when the insulator is present; without the insulator, the enhancer preferentially contacts $G_1$, so $G_2$ on the maternal allele is reduced, potentially silenced. This is equivalent to “paternalization” of the maternal allele. Secondary DMRs such as the $G_2$ promoter DMR are not deleted and retain their parental methylation states; thus, the paternal $G_2$ promoter remains methylated and off, and the maternal $G_2$ promoter remains unmethylated but enhancer-deprived.\n- Paternal deletion: In wild type, the paternal ICR is methylated and does not bind CTCF; enhancers already contact $G_1$, and $G_2$ is repressed by its promoter DMR methylation. Deleting the minimal ICR on the paternal allele removes a methylated sequence that was not supporting CTCF binding or insulation. With promoters and enhancer intact and secondary $G_2$ promoter DMR preserved, enhancer access to $G_1$ persists and $G_2$ remains off. Thus, at steady state, expression is expected to be similar to wild type for a paternal ICR deletion. The deletion may remove the ability to assay methylation at the ICR itself, but functional outputs should be unchanged.\n\nTo confirm loss of imprinting and its epigenetic basis, appropriate assays must measure allele-specific transcription and relevant chromatin features:\n\n- Allele-specific RNA measurement: Reciprocal $F_1$ crosses between strains with SNPs allow phasing of reads. RNA sequencing or RT-PCR across SNPs will reveal biallelic $G_1$ expression and loss of maternal $G_2$ expression when the deletion is maternally inherited, while showing near-wild-type monoallelic patterns when it is paternally inherited.\n- CTCF chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) or ChIP–quantitative PCR at the ICR will show loss of CTCF occupancy specifically on the maternal deleted allele in heterozygotes; the paternal allele lacks CTCF in wild type, so little change is expected with paternal deletion.\n- Bisulfite sequencing of the $G_2$ promoter DMR (not deleted) will show maintenance of paternal hypermethylation and maternal hypomethylation, supporting that the transcriptional switch upon maternal deletion is due to insulation loss rather than promoter methylation changes.\n- Chromosome conformation capture such as $4$C or Hi-C focused on the enhancer or $G_1$ promoter will show increased enhancer–$G_1$ contact frequency on the maternal deleted chromosome, consistent with the loss of the insulator.\n\nWith this reasoning, we evaluate each option:\n\nOption A: It states that maternal ICR deletion abolishes CTCF insulation, leading to paternalization of the maternal allele: near-biallelic $G_1$ and reduced or silenced $G_2$. This matches the insulator model: without CTCF on the maternal chromosome, enhancers can contact $G_1$, and $G_2$ loses access. It also states that paternal deletion has minimal effect on steady-state expression, which follows because the paternal allele already lacks CTCF binding and has enhancer access to $G_1$. The proposed assays are appropriate and specific: allele-specific RNA-seq or RT-PCR across SNPs in reciprocal $F_1$ crosses, CTCF ChIP to demonstrate loss of binding, bisulfite sequencing at the $G_2$ promoter DMR to verify parental methylation maintenance, and $4$C/Hi-C to demonstrate altered enhancer–$G_1$ contact. Verdict — Correct.\n\nOption B: It claims maternal deletion has no effect and paternal deletion maternalizes the paternal allele. This inverts the logic of methylation-sensitive CTCF binding: removal of an element that is unmethylated and functional on the maternal allele cannot have “no effect,” whereas removing a methylated, nonbinding paternal ICR cannot create an insulator. It also proposes only total, non-allele-specific RNA measurement, which cannot confirm loss of imprinting. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption C: It asserts that both deletions cause biallelic expression of both $G_1$ and $G_2$, implying simultaneous enhancer availability to both promoters despite normal enhancer competition and promoter-specific DMR control. This contradicts the mutually exclusive enhancer–promoter interactions governed by insulation and promoter methylation; moreover, it proposes methylation-sensitive restriction analysis at the deleted ICR, which is impossible because the recognition site would be absent. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption D: It posits uniform pre-implantation lethality for maternal minimal ICR deletion; minimal deletions of CTCF sites at many imprinted loci do not invariably cause lethality and often allow analysis of somatic imprinting outcomes. It also predicts a $50\\%$ reduction in $G_1$ upon paternal deletion without mechanistic basis, and proposes protein-only, non-allele-specific assays that cannot establish imprinting status. Verdict — Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2818994"}]}
