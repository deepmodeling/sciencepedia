According to the problem, this can happen only when the promoter is in the accessible state O.

Terms such as \"stability\" and \"occupancy\" are given operational definitions within the context of the experiment. There is no subjective or ambiguous phrasing.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. We may proceed to the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe problem revolves around the kinetics of enzymatic digestion. We can model the destruction of a DNA fragment population corresponding to a particular nucleosome, $i$, with a first-order rate law. The number of surviving fragments $N_i$ at time $t$ is given by $N_i(t) = N_i(0) \\exp(-k_i t)$, where $N_i(0)$ is the initial number of such nucleosomes and $k_i$ is the effective rate constant for their destruction by MNase.\n\nThe problem states that MNase action depends on accessibility and protection. Linker DNA is highly accessible and is cleaved rapidly. Nucleosomal DNA is protected, and its cleavage rate is much lower. Furthermore, nucleosome \"stability\" is defined as resistance to MNase, meaning stable nucleosomes have a lower rate constant for destruction ($k_{\\text{stable}}$) than fragile nucleosomes ($k_{\\text{fragile}}$). Thus, $k_{\\text{stable}} < k_{\\text{fragile}}$.\n\nAt short digestion times (e.g., $t_1$), MNase primarily cleaves linker DNA. Both stable and fragile nucleosomes largely survive, so the resulting pool of mononucleosome fragments provides a reasonably accurate representation of the initial nucleosome landscape.\n\nAt long digestion times (i.e., over-digestion, e.g., $t_3$), the reaction has proceeded long enough for the slower processes to become significant. Fragile nucleosomes, with their higher destruction rate constant $k_{\\text{fragile}}$, will be disproportionately eliminated from the population compared to stable nucleosomes. The ratio of surviving stable to fragile nucleosomes, $\\frac{N_{\\text{stable}}(t)}{N_{\\text{fragile}}(t)} = \\frac{N_{\\text{stable}}(0) \\exp(-k_{\\text{stable}}t)}{N_{\\text{fragile}}(0) \\exp(-k_{\\text{fragile}}t)}$, increases with time $t$ because the exponent for the fragile population is more negative. This results in a survivorship bias: the final sequenced library is enriched for fragments from stable nucleosomes. Consequently, the measured occupancy of stable nucleosomes is artificially inflated, while that of fragile nucleosomes is underestimated.\n\nTo detect this over-digestion, we must identify quantitative signatures of prolonged MNase activity.\n1.  **Fragment Length Distribution:** The canonical length of DNA wrapped in a core nucleosome is approximately $147$ base pairs (bp). MNase, being an exonuclease as well as an endonuclease, will not only cleave linkers but also \"nibble\" at the ends of the DNA fragments that are transiently unwrapped from the histone octamer. With prolonged digestion, this nibbling becomes more extensive. This process systematically shortens the mononucleosome fragments. Therefore, a diagnostic metric is the fragment length distribution. Over-digestion will cause a **leftward shift** in this distribution, a decrease in the modal fragment length to values significantly below $147$ bp, and a corresponding increase in the proportion of subnucleosomal fragments (e.g., those with length $< 120$ bp).\n\n2.  **Correlation with Intrinsic Stability Features:** Nucleosome stability is not random; it is influenced by the underlying DNA sequence and other genomic features. MNase itself has a sequence preference, tending to cut A/T-rich sequences more readily. Over-digestion acts as a strong selective pressure, preferentially preserving nucleosomes that are intrinsically more stable. These stable positions are often correlated with specific sequence features, such as local GC content or patterns that favor DNA bending. Therefore, as over-digestion proceeds, the surviving nucleosomes are no longer a representative sample of the initial population but a biased subset enriched for these intrinsic stability features. A second diagnostic metric is thus the **increased correlation** between measured nucleosome occupancy (read coverage) and sequence-based predictors of stability, such as local GC content or computationally predicted nucleosome affinity. The selection process amplifies the underlying, and otherwise weaker, signal from these sequence features.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Over-digestion increases the survivorship bias: nucleosomes with lower effective cleavage rates survive longer and thus contribute disproportionately to reads at large $t$. Two diagnostics are: (1) a leftward shift of the mononucleosomal fragment-length distribution, with increased subnucleosomal fragments (e.g., more fragments $<120$ base pairs and a modal length below approximately $147$ base pairs), and (2) an increased correlation between per-base coverage and local guanine-cytosine (GC) content or predicted intrinsic nucleosome formation energy, reflecting amplified MNase sequence bias and selection for intrinsically stable positions.**\n- **Explanation:** This correctly identifies survivorship bias as the mechanism. Nucleosomes with lower cleavage rates (i.e., more stable) survive longer. This is consistent with our derivation.\n- **Diagnostic 1:** This correctly identifies the leftward shift of the fragment length distribution due to \"nibbling,\" resulting in shorter fragments.\n- **Diagnostic 2:** This correctly identifies that the selection process will amplify the correlation between the surviving fragments and intrinsic sequence features that confer stability.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Over-digestion exposes fragile nucleosomes that were previously obscured, increasing their apparent occupancy. Two diagnostics are: (1) a rightward shift of the fragment-length distribution toward longer fragments (e.g., enrichment of fragments $>170$ base pairs), and (2) an increased proportion of dinucleosomal fragments relative to mononucleosomal fragments in the library.**\n- **Explanation:** This logic is inverted. Over-digestion *destroys* fragile nucleosomes, decreasing their apparent occupancy.\n- **Diagnostic 1:** A rightward shift to fragments $> 170$ bp is a sign of *under-digestion*, where some linker DNA remains attached. Over-digestion causes trimming, a leftward shift.\n- **Diagnostic 2:** An increased proportion of di- and multi-nucleosomal fragments is also a classic sign of *under-digestion*, where not all linker DNA has been cleaved.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Over-digestion increases the total number of cuts uniformly across all nucleosomes, leaving relative occupancy unchanged. Two diagnostics are: (1) a stable fragment-length mode at approximately $147$ base pairs across $t_1, t_2, t_3$, and (2) a decreased correlation between coverage and GC content due to averaging out sequence bias at higher cut counts.**\n- **Explanation:** This premise is false. MNase action is not uniform; it is selective based on stability and accessibility, which is the entire basis of the problem. Relative occupancy will change.\n- **Diagnostic 1:** A stable fragment-length mode would imply no \"nibbling,\" which is contrary to the known effect of extensive digestion.\n- **Diagnostic 2:** Selection due to over-digestion would *increase*, not decrease, the correlation with underlying sequence features that confer stability.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Over-digestion mainly affects polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification rather than digestion, causing amplification of rare fragments to dominate. Two diagnostics are: (1) an increased library duplication rate without changes in fragment-length distribution, and (2) no change in coverage–GC correlation because MNase cleavage is not sequence-biased.**\n- **Explanation:** This misattributes the effect. The question is about over-*digestion*, a process that occurs before PCR. While PCR introduces its own biases, it is not the primary mechanism described.\n- **Diagnostic 1:** Over-digestion absolutely changes the fragment-length distribution.\n- **Diagnostic 2:** The claim that MNase is not sequence-biased is factually incorrect; it has a well-documented preference for A/T-rich regions.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2797006"}]}
