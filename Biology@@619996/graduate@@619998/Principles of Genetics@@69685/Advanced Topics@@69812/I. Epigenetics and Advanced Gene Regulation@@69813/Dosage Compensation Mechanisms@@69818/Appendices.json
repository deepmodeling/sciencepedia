It presents a simplified but standard biostatistical model for analyzing gene expression data to estimate a biological parameter, the dosage compensation factor $c$. The assumptions—including the gene dosage principle, a global technical bias, and a log-normal error model—are common and appropriate for RNA-seq data analysis. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary data and model specifications provided. It is objective, formalizable, and does not violate any scientific or mathematical principles. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or pseudo-profound elements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution will be derived.\n\nThe task is to find the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the dosage compensation factor, $c$. We begin by formalizing the statistical model based on the provided assumptions.\n\nLet $A_{j}$ ($j = 1, \\dots, n_A$) be the observed male-to-female expression ratio for the $j$-th autosomal gene, and $R_{i}$ ($i = 1, \\dots, n_X$) be the ratio for the $i$-th X-linked gene. According to the problem statement, these observed ratios are the product of the true biological ratio, a global technical bias $b$, and a multiplicative noise term $\\epsilon$.\n\nFor an autosomal gene, the true ratio is $1$. Thus, the model is:\n$$A_{j} = 1 \\cdot b \\cdot \\epsilon_{A,j} = b \\cdot \\epsilon_{A,j}$$\nFor an X-linked gene, the true ratio, accounting for compensation, is $\\frac{c}{2}$. Thus, the model is:\n$$R_{i} = \\frac{c}{2} \\cdot b \\cdot \\epsilon_{X,i} = \\frac{bc}{2} \\cdot \\epsilon_{X,i}$$\n\nThe noise terms $\\epsilon_{A,j}$ and $\\epsilon_{X,i}$ are stated to follow a log-normal distribution with zero-mean in log space. This implies that their logarithms are normally distributed with a mean of $0$. Let's define the random variables $E_{A,j} = \\ln(\\epsilon_{A,j})$ and $E_{X,i} = \\ln(\\epsilon_{X,i})$. We have $E_{A,j} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_A^2)$ and $E_{X,i} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_X^2)$ for some variances $\\sigma_A^2$ and $\\sigma_X^2$.\n\nTo linearize the model and facilitate the likelihood calculation, we take the natural logarithm of the expressions for $A_j$ and $R_i$:\n$$\\ln(A_j) = \\ln(b) + \\ln(\\epsilon_{A,j}) = \\ln(b) + E_{A,j}$$\n$$\\ln(R_i) = \\ln(b) + \\ln(c) - \\ln(2) + \\ln(\\epsilon_{X,i}) = \\ln(b) + \\ln(c) - \\ln(2) + E_{X,i}$$\n\nFrom this, we see that the log-transformed data are normally distributed. Let $a_j = \\ln(A_j)$ and $r_i = \\ln(R_i)$. Their distributions are:\n$$a_j \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_A, \\sigma_A^2) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\mu_A = \\ln(b)$$\n$$r_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_X, \\sigma_X^2) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\mu_X = \\ln(b) + \\ln(c) - \\ln(2)$$\n\nThe parameters to be estimated are $c$ and $b$ (or $\\ln(c)$ and $\\ln(b)$), along with the nuisance parameters $\\sigma_A^2$ and $\\sigma_X^2$. The log-likelihood function, $\\mathcal{L}$, for the observed data is the sum of the log-likelihoods for the autosomal and X-linked samples, given their independence.\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(\\ln(b), \\ln(c), \\sigma_A^2, \\sigma_X^2) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n_A} \\ln(p(a_j | \\mu_A, \\sigma_A^2)) + \\sum_{i=1}^{n_X} \\ln(p(r_i | \\mu_X, \\sigma_X^2)) $$\n$$ \\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n_A} \\left( -\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2\\pi\\sigma_A^2) - \\frac{(a_j - \\mu_A)^2}{2\\sigma_A^2} \\right) + \\sum_{i=1}^{n_X} \\left( -\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2\\pi\\sigma_X^2) - \\frac{(r_i - \\mu_X)^2}{2\\sigma_X^2} \\right) $$\n\nTo find the MLEs, we must maximize $\\mathcal{L}$ with respect to the parameters. For any given values of $\\sigma_A^2$ and $\\sigma_X^2$, $\\mathcal{L}$ is maximized by minimizing the sum of squared errors. The MLE for the mean of a normal distribution is the sample mean. Thus:\n$$\\hat{\\mu}_A = \\frac{1}{n_A} \\sum_{j=1}^{n_A} a_j = \\frac{1}{n_A} \\sum_{j=1}^{n_A} \\ln(A_j)$$\n$$\\hat{\\mu}_X = \\frac{1}{n_X} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_X} r_i = \\frac{1}{n_X} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_X} \\ln(R_i)$$\n\nWe now substitute the expressions for $\\mu_A$ and $\\mu_X$ into these estimator equations:\n$$ \\ln(\\hat{b}) = \\frac{1}{n_A} \\sum_{j=1}^{n_A} \\ln(A_j) $$\n$$ \\ln(\\hat{b}) + \\ln(\\hat{c}) - \\ln(2) = \\frac{1}{n_X} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_X} \\ln(R_i) $$\n\nWe have a system of two linear equations for $\\ln(\\hat{b})$ and $\\ln(\\hat{c})$. Substituting the first equation into the second yields:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{1}{n_A} \\sum_{j=1}^{n_A} \\ln(A_j)\\right) + \\ln(\\hat{c}) - \\ln(2) = \\frac{1}{n_X} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_X} \\ln(R_i) $$\nSolving for $\\ln(\\hat{c})$, the MLE of $\\ln(c)$:\n$$ \\ln(\\hat{c}) = \\left( \\frac{1}{n_X} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_X} \\ln(R_i) \\right) - \\left( \\frac{1}{n_A} \\sum_{j=1}^{n_A} \\ln(A_j) \\right) + \\ln(2) $$\n\nThe arithmetic mean of logarithms is the logarithm of the geometric mean. Let $G_X$ and $G_A$ be the geometric means of the X-linked and autosomal ratios, respectively:\n$$ G_X = \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{n_X} R_i \\right)^{1/n_X} \\implies \\ln(G_X) = \\frac{1}{n_X} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_X} \\ln(R_i) $$\n$$ G_A = \\left( \\prod_{j=1}^{n_A} A_j \\right)^{1/n_A} \\implies \\ln(G_A) = \\frac{1}{n_A} \\sum_{j=1}^{n_A} \\ln(A_j) $$\nSubstituting these into the equation for $\\ln(\\hat{c})$ provides a more compact form:\n$$ \\ln(\\hat{c}) = \\ln(G_X) - \\ln(G_A) + \\ln(2) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{2 G_X}{G_A}\\right) $$\nBy the invariance property of maximum likelihood estimators, exponentiating both sides gives the MLE for $c$:\n$$ \\hat{c} = \\frac{2 G_X}{G_A} = 2 \\frac{\\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{n_X} R_i \\right)^{1/n_X}}{\\left( \\prod_{j=1}^{n_A} A_j \\right)^{1/n_A}} $$\nThis is the derived maximum likelihood estimator for $c$ in terms of the observed ratios.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided data:\n$n_A = 5$, $A_j: \\{0.8, 1.25, 0.8, 1.25, 1.0\\}$\n$n_X = 5$, $R_i: \\{0.97, 0.97, 0.97, 0.97, 0.97\\}$\n\nFirst, calculate the geometric mean of the autosomal ratios, $G_A$:\n$$ G_A = (0.8 \\times 1.25 \\times 0.8 \\times 1.25 \\times 1.0)^{1/5} $$\nSince $0.8 \\times 1.25 = 1.0$, the product becomes:\n$$ G_A = (1.0 \\times 1.0 \\times 1.0)^{1/5} = (1.0)^{1/5} = 1.0 $$\nNext, calculate the geometric mean of the X-linked ratios, $G_X$:\n$$ G_X = (0.97 \\times 0.97 \\times 0.97 \\times 0.97 \\times 0.97)^{1/5} = (0.97^5)^{1/5} = 0.97 $$\n\nSubstitute these geometric means into the estimator for $\\hat{c}$:\n$$ \\hat{c} = \\frac{2 \\times G_X}{G_A} = \\frac{2 \\times 0.97}{1.0} = 1.94 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, the value is $1.940$.\nThis result implies that, based on the provided data and model, the transcription from the single male X chromosome is upregulated by a factor of approximately $1.94$, which nearly, but not perfectly, compensates for the difference in gene dosage, as perfect compensation would correspond to $c=2$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1.940} $$", "id": "2806728"}, {"introduction": "Mammals employ a different strategy for dosage compensation: the transcriptional silencing of one X chromosome in females, a process known as X-chromosome inactivation (XCI).

We can calculate the first integral and multiply by $2$.\nLet's compute the first integral, $I_1$:\n$$ I_1 = \\int_0^\\infty \\int_{t_1+\\tau(R)}^\\infty (\\lambda(R))^2 \\exp(-\\lambda(R)(t_1+t_2)) dt_2 dt_1 $$\n$$ I_1 = \\int_0^\\infty \\lambda(R) \\exp(-\\lambda(R)t_1) \\left[ \\int_{t_1+\\tau(R)}^\\infty \\lambda(R) \\exp(-\\lambda(R)t_2) dt_2 \\right] dt_1 $$\nThe inner integral is the survival function $P(T_2 > t_1 + \\tau(R))$:\n$$ \\int_{t_1+\\tau(R)}^\\infty \\lambda(R) \\exp(-\\lambda(R)t_2) dt_2 = \\left[ -\\exp(-\\lambda(R)t_2) \\right]_{t_1+\\tau(R)}^\\infty = 0 - (-\\exp(-\\lambda(R)(t_1+\\tau(R)))) = \\exp(-\\lambda(R)(t_1+\\tau(R))) $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $I_1$:\n$$ I_1 = \\int_0^\\infty \\lambda(R) \\exp(-\\lambda(R)t_1) \\exp(-\\lambda(R)(t_1+\\tau(R))) dt_1 $$\n$$ I_1 = \\int_0^\\infty \\lambda(R) \\exp(-2\\lambda(R)t_1 - \\lambda(R)\\tau(R)) dt_1 $$\n$$ I_1 = \\exp(-\\lambda(R)\\tau(R)) \\int_0^\\infty \\lambda(R) \\exp(-2\\lambda(R)t_1) dt_1 $$\nThe remaining integral is:\n$$ \\int_0^\\infty \\lambda(R) \\exp(-2\\lambda(R)t_1) dt_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\infty 2\\lambda(R) \\exp(-2\\lambda(R)t_1) dt_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ -\\exp(-2\\lambda(R)t_1) \\right]_0^\\infty = \\frac{1}{2} (0 - (-1)) = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nSo, $I_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\exp(-\\lambda(R)\\tau(R))$.\nThe total probability is $P(\\Delta T > \\tau(R)) = 2 \\times I_1 = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\exp(-\\lambda(R)\\tau(R)) = \\exp(-\\lambda(R)\\tau(R))$.\nThis confirms that the time lag $\\Delta T$ follows an exponential distribution with rate $\\lambda(R)$.\n\nThe final step is to substitute the given expressions for $\\lambda(R)$ and $\\tau(R)$:\n$$ \\lambda(R) = \\alpha R $$\n$$ \\tau(R) = \\frac{\\tau_0}{R} $$\nThe product in the exponent is:\n$$ \\lambda(R) \\tau(R) = (\\alpha R) \\left( \\frac{\\tau_0}{R} \\right) = \\alpha \\tau_0 $$\nThe dependence on the ratio $R$ cancels. Therefore, the probability of a monoallelic outcome, $P_{\\text{mono}}$, is:\n$$ P_{\\text{mono}} = \\exp(-\\alpha \\tau_0) $$\nThis result provides the probability of successful dosage compensation as a function of the intrinsic initiation propensity and the feedback timescale, independent of the cell's specific X-to-autosome ratio under this model's assumptions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\exp(-\\alpha \\tau_{0})}$$", "id": "2806735"}]}
