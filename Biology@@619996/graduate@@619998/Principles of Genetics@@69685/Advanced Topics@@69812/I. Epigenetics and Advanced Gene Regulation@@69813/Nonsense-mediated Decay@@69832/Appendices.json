This first exercise [@problem_id:2833286] provides hands-on practice in applying this rule by challenging you to meticulously map the architecture of a hypothetical messenger RNA, calculate the critical distance from the PTC to the final splice junction, and make a definitive prediction about the transcript's fate.", "problem": "You are given a mature messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) composed of exons that have been spliced together in the canonical order with exact exon lengths as follows: exon $1$: $180$ nucleotides, exon $2$: $120$ nucleotides, exon $3$: $200$ nucleotides, exon $4$: $160$ nucleotides, exon $5$: $300$ nucleotides. In the wild-type transcript, the annotated start codon is at the first nucleotide of exon $1$ and the annotated stop codon is within exon $5$. A nonsense mutation introduces a premature stop codon in exon $3$; within exon $3$, the three nucleotides of this stop codon occupy positions $150$–$152$ when counting from the $5'$ end of exon $3$ (i.e., the last nucleotide of the premature stop codon is position $152$ of exon $3$).

All necessary information to calculate the required distance and apply the NMD rule is present. The placement of the PTC in an internal exon upstream of the final exon junction is a valid scenario for NMD analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. A solution will be formulated.\n\n**Solution Formulation**\n\nThe problem has two parts: first, to calculate a specific distance, $d$, on the mature mRNA, and second, to use this distance to predict the occurrence of NMD.\n\nFirst, we calculate the distance $d$. This distance is defined as the number of nucleotides from the last nucleotide of the premature stop codon (PTC) to the final exon–exon junction. The sequence of interest lies between the PTC in exon $3$ and the junction between exon $4$ and exon $5$.\n\nThe PTC is located at positions $150$, $151$, and $152$ within exon $3$. The last nucleotide of the PTC is therefore at position $152$ relative to the start of exon $3$.\nExon $3$ has a total length of $L_3 = 200$ nucleotides. The number of nucleotides remaining in exon $3$ downstream of the PTC's final nucleotide is:\n$$ N_{3, \\text{downstream}} = L_3 - 152 = 200 - 152 = 48 \\text{ nucleotides} $$\n\nThe full length of exon $4$ lies between exon $3$ and the final exon-exon junction (the junction between exon $4$ and exon $5$). The length of exon $4$ is given as $L_4 = 160$ nucleotides.\n\nThe total distance $d$ is the sum of the remaining part of exon $3$ and the entire length of exon $4$.\n$$ d = N_{3, \\text{downstream}} + L_4 $$\n$$ d = 48 + 160 = 208 \\text{ nucleotides} $$\nThis is the distance in nucleotides from the last base of the PTC to the splice junction between exon $4$ and exon $5$.\n\nSecond, we determine if this transcript is a predicted target for NMD. The NMD pathway identifies and degrades mRNAs containing PTCs. The key mechanism involves the deposition of Exon Junction Complexes (EJCs) on the mRNA after splicing.\n\n**Assumption:** A core assumption is that an EJC is deposited in its canonical position, which is approximately $20$–$24$ nucleotides upstream of each exon-exon splice junction. For this problem, the critical EJC is the one deposited upstream of the final junction, i.e., within exon $4$ at a position approximately $20$–$24$ nucleotides $5'$ to the exon $4$-exon $5$ boundary.\n\nThe NMD machinery is triggered when a translating ribosome terminates at a PTC but leaves at least one EJC downstream. The \"classical $50$–$55$ nucleotide rule\" is an empirical generalization of this principle. It states that if a PTC is located more than $50$–$55$ nucleotides upstream of a downstream exon-exon junction, NMD will be triggered. This critical distance accounts for the space occupied by the EJC itself (so it is not sterically occluded) and the footprint of the terminating ribosome, allowing for the stable recruitment of UPF proteins (the core NMD factors) to the EJC-ribosome complex.\n\nWe compare our calculated distance $d$ to this threshold.\n$$ d = 208 \\text{ nucleotides} $$\nThe threshold for NMD activation is approximately `$50$–$55$` nucleotides.\nSince $d = 208$ is substantially greater than $55$ ($208 > 55$), the PTC is located far upstream of the final exon–exon junction. The EJC deposited at the exon $4$-exon $5$ junction will remain on the mRNA after the ribosome terminates at the PTC in exon $3$. This configuration is the canonical signal for NMD.\n\nTherefore, according to the $50$–$55$ nucleotide rule and the standard model of EJC-dependent NMD, this mRNA transcript would be predicted to be a target for degradation by the NMD pathway.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{208}$$", "id": "2833286"}, {"introduction": "Moving from prediction to experimentation is a critical step in molecular genetics.

The human beta-globin locus naturally comprises $3$ exons separated by $2$ introns and produces a messenger RNA (mRNA) with a translation termination codon in the last exon under normal circumstances. During pre-mRNA splicing, an Exon Junction Complex (EJC) is deposited approximately $20$–$24$ nucleotides upstream of each exon–exon junction. During the pioneer round of translation, ribosomes displace EJCs they traverse; any EJC that remains downstream (in the $3'$ direction) of a terminating ribosome can recruit NMD factors. Empirically, in mammalian cells, a premature termination codon (PTC) positioned sufficiently upstream of the last exon–exon junction can leave at least one downstream EJC to elicit NMD, whereas a PTC in the last exon typically does not, unless an additional downstream exon–exon junction is present in the $3'$ untranslated region (UTR).\n\nYou are to select the construct(s) that will robustly elicit EJC-dependent NMD in human cells and, by design, place the PTC at a position that satisfies the canonical distance requirement relative to the nearest downstream exon–exon junction.

A PTC in the last exon is typically ineffective unless an additional downstream exon–exon junction exists in the $3'$ untranslated region (UTR).\n- **Design Requirement**: The selected construct(s) must robustly elicit EJC-dependent NMD and the PTC must satisfy the \"canonical distance requirement\" relative to the nearest downstream exon–exon junction.\n- **Assumptions**: Use of native human beta-globin sequences unless specified; intact splicing and NMD cellular machinery.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem statement accurately describes the canonical mechanism of EJC-dependent NMD. Key elements such as the role of splicing in EJC deposition, the pioneer round of translation, and the spatial relationship between a PTC and a downstream EJC are consistent with established molecular biology principles. The well-known \"50-55 nucleotide rule,\" which states that a PTC must be at least $50$–$55$ nucleotides upstream of a downstream exon–exon junction to trigger NMD, is implicitly referenced by the phrases \"sufficiently upstream\" and \"canonical distance requirement\".\n- **Well-Posedness**: The question is well-posed.

There are no identifiable flaws. It represents a valid problem in molecular genetics. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution and evaluation of the options.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core principle for canonical EJC-dependent NMD is as follows: a messenger RNA (mRNA) will be targeted for degradation if translation terminates at a premature termination codon (PTC) that is located a sufficient distance upstream of a splice-site-generated exon-exon junction. This distance ensures that the exon junction complex (EJC), which is deposited $\\approx 20-24$ nucleotides upstream of the junction, is not displaced by the terminating ribosome. The established canonical distance is greater than approximately $50$–$55$ nucleotides between the PTC and the exon-exon junction.\n\nI will now evaluate each of the given options against this principle.\n\n**A. Genomic minigene with the native $3$-exon, $2$-intron structure; introduce a UAG premature termination codon in exon $2$ located $60$ nucleotides upstream of the exon $2$–exon $3$ junction.**\nThis construct is based on a genomic template containing introns, so pre-mRNA splicing will occur. Splicing will create an exon $2$–exon $3$ junction and deposit an EJC upstream of it. The PTC is located in exon $2$. Consequently, the ribosome will terminate translation within exon $2$. The distance from the PTC to the downstream exon $2$–exon $3$ junction is given as $60$ nucleotides. This distance is greater than the canonical threshold of $\\approx 50$–$55$ nucleotides required to trigger NMD. The EJC associated with the downstream junction will therefore remain on the mRNA after termination and recruit NMD factors. This design correctly and robustly engineers a substrate for EJC-dependent NMD.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Intronless complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding beta-globin (no introns, hence no exon–exon junctions in the mature transcript); introduce a UAG premature termination codon at the position corresponding to $60$ nucleotides upstream of the exon $2$–exon $3$ junction in the genomic reference.**\nThis construct is derived from a cDNA, which by definition lacks introns. Transcription of a cDNA template produces a pre-mRNA that does not undergo splicing. EJC deposition is a consequence of splicing. In the absence of splicing, no exon-exon junctions are created, and thus no EJCs are deposited onto the mRNA. The problem specifically asks to assay for *EJC-dependent* NMD. As this construct produces an mRNA devoid of EJCs, it cannot be a substrate for the EJC-dependent NMD pathway, regardless of the PTC's location.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Genomic minigene with the native $3$-exon, $2$-intron structure; introduce a UAG premature termination codon in exon $3$ located $80$ nucleotides downstream of the exon $2$–exon $3$ junction (i.e., within the last exon).**\nThis construct is a genomic minigene, so splicing will occur, placing EJCs upstream of the exon $1$–exon $2$ and exon $2$–exon $3$ junctions. The PTC is located in exon $3$, the final exon in this native configuration. During the pioneer round of translation, the ribosome will traverse exons $1$ and $2$, C thereby displacing the EJCs associated with both junctions. Translation will then terminate at the PTC in exon $3$. At the point of termination, there are no exon-exon junctions, and hence no EJCs, located downstream of the ribosome. As stated in the problem, \"a PTC in the last exon typically does not [elicit NMD]\". This construct conforms to that rule.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Genomic minigene in which a single synthetic intron is inserted into the $3'$ untranslated region downstream of the normal beta-globin stop codon, creating one additional exon–exon junction within the $3'$ untranslated region; introduce a UAG premature termination codon in exon $3$ positioned $80$ nucleotides upstream of this engineered $3'$ untranslated region exon–exon junction.**\nThis construct modifies the native gene by inserting an intron into the $3'$ UTR. The result is a gene that, after splicing, produces an mRNA with an additional exon-exon junction located within the $3'$ UTR. The PTC is introduced in exon $3$. During translation, the ribosome will terminate at this PTC. Crucially, there is now an exon-exon junction (and its associated EJC) downstream of this termination event. The distance between the PTC and this new junction is specified as $80$ nucleotides. This distance is well above the $\\approx 50$–$55$ nucleotide threshold. The EJC in the $3'$ UTR will not be displaced and will successfully trigger NMD. This design is a classic experimental strategy to demonstrate the NMD mechanism and fulfills the exception noted in the problem statement.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. Genomic minigene with the native $3$-exon, $2$-intron structure; introduce a UAG premature termination codon in exon $2$ located $30$ nucleotides upstream of the exon $2$–exon $3$ junction.**\nAs in option A, this genomic construct will produce a spliced mRNA with an EJC upstream of the exon $2$-exon $3$ junction. However, the PTC in exon $2$ is positioned only $30$ nucleotides upstream of the junction. This distance is significantly less than the canonical requirement of $\\approx 50$–$55$ nucleotides. The terminating ribosome possesses a physical footprint and likely surveys a short region downstream of the stop codon. A distance of only $30$ nucleotides is generally insufficient to prevent the ribosome from interacting with and displacing the downstream EJC. Therefore, this construct would not \"robustly elicit\" NMD as required.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2833317"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal of many biological experiments is to move beyond qualitative observations to quantitative, mechanistic insights.

Thus, we can write $F_{\\mathrm{net}} = C \\cdot \\frac{s}{k}$, where $C$ is a proportionality constant. Since $C$ and $s$ are assumed to be constant across all experiments, we can define a new constant $K = C \\cdot s$, such that $F_{\\mathrm{net}} = K/k$. This implies that the ratio of two net fluorescence signals is the inverse ratio of their corresponding total decay constants.\n$$ \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{net},1}}{F_{\\mathrm{net},2}} = \\frac{K/k_1}{K/k_2} = \\frac{k_2}{k_1} $$\n\nNow, we compute the NMD efficiency, $E$.
