Let us denote the energetic barrier for selecting the top strand as $E_{\\text{top}}$ and for the bottom strand as $E_{\\text{bottom}}$. The probability of selecting the top strand, $P_{\\text{top}}$, is the ratio of its Boltzmann factor to the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all possible states (the partition function, $Z$):\n$$P_{\\text{top}} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\text{top}}}{RT}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\text{top}}}{RT}\\right) + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\text{bottom}}}{RT}\\right)}$$\nThis expression can be algebraically simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by $\\exp(-E_{\\text{top}} / (RT))$:\n$$P_{\\text{top}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\text{bottom}} - E_{\\text{top}}}{RT}\\right)}$$\n\nThe first step is to compute the energetic barriers $E_{\\text{top}}$ and $E_{\\text{bottom}}$ using the provided formula: $E_i = -\\Delta G_{5^{\\prime}(i)} - \\varepsilon(n_i)$.\n\nFor the top strand to be selected as the guide:\nThe relevant local stability is at its $5^{\\prime}$ end, given as $\\Delta G_{5^{\\prime}(\\text{top})} = -3.2\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$.\nThe $5^{\\prime}$ nucleotide of the top strand is U, so $n_{\\text{top}} = \\mathrm{U}$, and its associated offset is $\\varepsilon(\\mathrm{U}) = 0.7\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$.\nThe energetic barrier is:\n$$E_{\\text{top}} = -(\\Delta G_{5^{\\prime}(\\text{top})}) - \\varepsilon(n_{\\text{top}}) = -(-3.2\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}) - 0.7\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}} = 3.2 - 0.7 = 2.5\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$$\n\nFor the bottom strand to be selected as the guide:\nThe relevant local stability is at its $5^{\\prime}$ end, $\\Delta G_{5^{\\prime}(\\text{bottom})}$.

They assay the following phenotypes under otherwise identical conditions: (i) response to exogenous small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting a reporter with perfect complementarity, (ii) microRNA (miRNA)-like repression of a reporter carrying $6$ bulged seed-matched sites for an endogenous miRNA, (iii) global changes in poly(A) tail lengths and steady-state half-lives of validated miRNA target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), (iv) ribosome footprint occupancy on miRNA targets, and (v) presence of cytoplasmic Processing bodies (P-bodies). The team seeks to determine which pattern of outcomes is expected in each genotype and why.\n\nBase your reasoning only on the following foundational principles and well-established facts: (a) the Central Dogma dictates that mRNA stability and translation rate jointly determine protein output; (b) in animals, miRNAs guide Argonaute (AGO) proteins to partially complementary sites to repress gene expression via translational repression and deadenylation/decapping-mediated decay; (c) AGO2 uniquely possesses endonucleolytic “slicer” activity that cleaves targets with near-perfect complementarity, whereas AGO1, AGO3, and AGO4 lack efficient slicing in mammalian cells; (d) GW182/TNRC6 proteins bind AGO through tryptophan-containing motifs and recruit CCR4-NOT and PAN2-PAN3 deadenylase complexes, decapping factors, and DDX6 to effect deadenylation, decapping, and translational repression; (e) P-bodies are cytoplasmic foci whose assembly depends on GW182/TNRC6 and DDX6 but not strictly on AGO2; (f) exogenous siRNA knockdown via perfect complementarity primarily proceeds through AGO2-dependent slicing, whereas miRNA-like seed-driven repression can be mediated by AGO1/AGO3/AGO4 in the absence of AGO2.\n\nWhich option best describes the expected phenotypic contrasts between the AGO2-knockout and the TNRC6A/B/C-triple-knockout cell lines and correctly justifies them mechanistically?\n\nA. AGO2 knockout abolishes siRNA-mediated cleavage of the perfect-match reporter, but miRNA-like repression of bulged-site reporters remains largely intact due to compensation by AGO1/AGO3/AGO4; global miRNA target deadenylation, decay, and translational repression are preserved, P-bodies persist. In contrast, TNRC6A/B/C knockout spares AGO2-mediated slicing of the perfect-match reporter yet abolishes miRNA-like repression (loss of deadenylation and translational repression), leading to longer poly(A) tails, increased half-lives, elevated ribosome occupancy on miRNA targets, and loss of P-bodies.\n\nB. AGO2 knockout eliminates all small RNA-mediated silencing, including both siRNA slicing and miRNA repression, and dissolves P-bodies because AGO2 is the sole scaffold for the silencing machinery; TNRC6A/B/C knockout causes only mild effects because CCR4-NOT can be recruited by AGO proteins directly without GW182.\n\nC.

TNRC6A/B/C knockout leaves translational repression by miRNAs intact while selectively impairing mRNA decay of miRNA targets, because CCR4-NOT is needed only for deadenylation; AGO2 knockout abolishes both slicing and miRNA-driven decay, but does not affect translational repression because this is AGO-independent.\n\nChoose the single best option.", "solution": "The problem statement describes a well-conceived experiment to dissect the functions of key components of the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC). The provided foundational principles (a) through (f) are accurate reflections of established molecular biology. The problem is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and well-posed. We shall proceed by systematically deducing the expected phenotypes for each genetic knockout and then evaluating the given options against these deductions.\n\nLet us analyze the two experimental conditions:\n\n**1. Analysis of the Argonaute 2 Knockout (AGO2-KO) Cell Line**\n\nThis cell line lacks the AGO2 protein. We must consider the consequences based on the provided principles.\n\n*   **Phenotype (i): Response to exogenous siRNA with perfect complementarity.** Principle (c) states that AGO2 uniquely possesses the endonucleolytic \"slicer\" activity required to cleave targets with near-perfect complementarity. Principle (f) further specifies that siRNA knockdown via perfect complementarity primarily uses this AGO2-dependent slicing. Therefore, in the absence of AGO2, the cleavage of the perfectly matched reporter mRNA will be abolished.\n*   **Phenotype (ii): miRNA-like repression.** Principle (f) asserts that miRNA-like repression can be mediated by other Argonaute proteins (AGO1, AGO3, AGO4) in the absence of AGO2. These other AGO proteins can be loaded with endogenous miRNAs and guided to target sites.\n*   **Phenotypes (iii) and (iv): Global miRNA target effects (deadenylation, decay, translational repression).** According to principle (d), the GW182/TNRC6 proteins, which are present in this cell line, bind to AGO proteins to recruit the downstream effector machinery responsible for deadenylation, decapping, and translational repression. Since the other AGO proteins (AGO1, AGO3, AGO4) are functional and can bind GW182/TNRC6, the overall miRNA-mediated pathway of repression remains largely intact. Consequently, we expect no major global changes in poly(A) tail lengths, mRNA half-lives, or ribosome footprint occupancy on miRNA targets.\n*   **Phenotype (v): Presence of P-bodies.** Principle (e) explicitly states that P-body assembly depends on GW182/TNRC6 and DDX6, but not strictly on AGO2. Since the core scaffold proteins GW182/TNRC6 are present, P-bodies will continue to form.\n\n**Summary for AGO2-KO:** Slicing is abolished, but miRNA-mediated repression (including deadenylation, decay, and translational inhibition) and P-body formation are largely preserved due to functional redundancy of other AGO proteins.\n\n**2. Analysis of the TNRC6A/B/C Triple Knockout (TNRC6-KO) Cell Line**\n\nThis cell line lacks the key scaffolding proteins of the GW182 family.\n\n*   **Phenotype (i): Response to exogenous siRNA with perfect complementarity.** This process relies on the intrinsic slicer activity of AGO2 (principle c). The TNRC6 proteins are not required for this cleavage event. Since AGO2 is present and functional in this cell line, siRNA-mediated slicing of the perfect-match reporter will be unaffected.\n*   **Phenotypes (ii), (iii), and (iv): miRNA-mediated repression and its consequences.** Principle (d) is critical here. GW182/TNRC6 proteins are the essential molecular bridge that connects miRNA-loaded AGO proteins to the effector complexes (CCR4-NOT for deadenylation, decapping factors, and machinery for translational repression). With a triple knockout of TNRC6A/B/C, this link is severed. Although AGO proteins can still bind to miRNA targets, they cannot recruit the machinery to execute repression. As a result, all major downstream steps of miRNA-mediated silencing will be abolished. This will manifest as:\n    *   Failure to repress the bulged-site reporter.\n    *   Abolition of deadenylation, leading to longer poly(A) tails and increased steady-state half-lives of target mRNAs.\n    *   Abolition of translational repression, leading to increased ribosome footprint occupancy on target mRNAs.\n*   **Phenotype (v): Presence of P-bodies.** Principle (e) states that P-body assembly is dependent on GW182/TNRC6. The removal of these proteins will thus lead to the dissolution or failure of P-bodies to form.\n\n**Summary for TNRC6-KO:** Slicing activity is preserved, but all aspects of canonical miRNA-mediated repression are lost, resulting in stabilization and increased translation of target mRNAs, and the disappearance of P-bodies.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. AGO2 knockout abolishes siRNA-mediated cleavage of the perfect-match reporter, but miRNA-like repression of bulged-site reporters remains largely intact due to compensation by AGO1/AGO3/AGO4; global miRNA target deadenylation, decay, and translational repression are preserved, P-bodies persist. In contrast, TNRC6A/B/C knockout spares AGO2-mediated slicing of the perfect-match reporter yet abolishes miRNA-like repression (loss of deadenylation and translational repression), leading to longer poly(A) tails, increased half-lives, elevated ribosome occupancy on miRNA targets, and loss of P-bodies.**\n    This option precisely matches our derived conclusions for both knockout scenarios. Every statement is a direct and correct logical consequence of the provided principles.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. AGO2 knockout eliminates all small RNA-mediated silencing, including both siRNA slicing and miRNA repression, and dissolves P-bodies because AGO2 is the sole scaffold for the silencing machinery; TNRC6A/B/C knockout causes only mild effects because CCR4-NOT can be recruited by AGO proteins directly without GW182.**\n    This option is flawed. The claim that AGO2-KO eliminates miRNA repression contradicts principle (f). The claim that AGO2 is the \"sole scaffold\" and its loss dissolves P-bodies contradicts principle (e). The claim that TNRC6-KO has mild effects because CCR4-NOT can be recruited directly by AGO proteins contradicts principle (d), which establishes GW182/TNRC6 as the necessary intermediary.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. AGO2 directly catalyzes deadenylation of miRNA targets; hence AGO2 knockout produces stronger global increases in poly(A) tail lengths and mRNA half-lives of miRNA targets than TNRC6A/B/C knockout, which mainly affects P-body morphology but leaves most miRNA-mediated repression intact.**\n    This option is fundamentally incorrect. AGO2 does not directly catalyze deadenylation; its unique catalytic function is slicing (principle c). Deadenylation is mediated by complexes recruited by GW182/TNRC6 (principle d). Consequently, the conclusion that AGO2-KO has a stronger effect on poly(A) tails than TNRC6-KO is the opposite of the correct deduction. The claim that TNRC6-KO leaves repression intact is a direct contradiction of principle (d).\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. TNRC6A/B/C knockout leaves translational repression by miRNAs intact while selectively impairing mRNA decay of miRNA targets, because CCR4-NOT is needed only for deadenylation; AGO2 knockout abolishes both slicing and miRNA-driven decay, but does not affect translational repression because this is AGO-independent.**\n    This option contains multiple errors. Principle (d) states GW182/TNRC6 is required for both deadenylation *and* translational repression, so a TNRC6-KO would not leave translational repression intact. The statement that AGO2-KO abolishes miRNA-driven decay contradicts the redundancy described in principle (f). The final claim that translational repression is AGO-independent is a gross misrepresentation of the entire mechanism, which is initiated by an AGO-miRNA complex binding to an mRNA (principle b).\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2828255"}, {"introduction": "Once assembled and targeted, the primary function of RISC is to downregulate gene expression.
