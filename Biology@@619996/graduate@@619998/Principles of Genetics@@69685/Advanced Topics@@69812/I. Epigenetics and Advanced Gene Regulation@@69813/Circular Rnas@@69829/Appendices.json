The analysis must be grounded in the provided first-order decay model.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the decay process. The problem states that the abundance $N(t)$ of any RNA isoform follows first-order kinetics, described by the ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k N(t)\n$$\nHere, $k$ is the first-order decay rate constant, which is specific to each RNA species. This is a separable differential equation.

This is the time required for the abundance to decrease to one-half of its initial value. We substitute $t = t_{1/2}$ and $N(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} N(0)$ into the decay equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} N(0) = N(0) \\exp(-k t_{1/2})\n$$\nDividing by $N(0)$, which is non-zero, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k t_{1/2})\n$$\nTo solve for $t_{1/2}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k t_{1/2}\n$$\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2}\n$$\nThis gives the fundamental relationship between the half-life and the decay rate constant:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}\n$$\nThis relationship shows that a longer half-life corresponds to a smaller decay rate constant $k$.\n\nNow, we apply this framework to the provided data for each RNA isoform.\n\nFor the linear mRNA, we are given $N_{\\mathrm{lin}}(t)$:\n- $N_{\\mathrm{lin}}(0) = 800$\n- $N_{\\mathrm{lin}}(4) = 400$\nBy direct application of the definition of half-life, we observe that at $t=4 \\text{ h}$, the abundance $N_{\\mathrm{lin}}(4)$ is exactly one-half of the initial abundance $N_{\\mathrm{lin}}(0)$.\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{lin}}(4) = 400 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 800 = \\frac{1}{2} N_{\\mathrm{lin}}(0)\n$$\nTherefore, the half-life of the linear mRNA is precisely:\n$$\nt_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{lin}} = 4 \\text{ h}\n$$\nThe remaining data points for the linear isoform ($N_{\\mathrm{lin}}(8)=200$ and $N_{\\mathrm{lin}}(12)=100$) are consistent with this half-life, representing decays over two and three half-lives, respectively.\n\nFor the circular RNA, we are given $N_{\\mathrm{circ}}(t)$:\n- $N_{\\mathrm{circ}}(0) = 1000$\n- $N_{\\mathrm{circ}}(12) = 500$\nAgain, by direct application of the definition, we observe that at $t=12 \\text{ h}$, the abundance $N_{\\mathrm{circ}}(12)$ is exactly one-half of the initial abundance $N_{\\mathrm{circ}}(0)$.\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{circ}}(12) = 500 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1000 = \\frac{1}{2} N_{\\mathrm{circ}}(0)\n$$\nTherefore, the half-life of the circular RNA is:\n$$\nt_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{circ}} = 12 \\text{ h}\n$$\nWe must verify that the other data points are consistent with this half-life.

As the result is an exact integer, we express it as $3.000$.\n\nThe biological significance of the result $R=3.000$ is that the circular RNA isoform is three times more stable than its linear mRNA counterpart produced from the same gene. This increased stability is a direct consequence of the molecular structure of RNA. Linear RNA molecules, including canonical mRNAs, possess free $5'$ and $3'$ ends. In the cytoplasm, these ends serve as entry points for exonucleases—enzymes that progressively degrade the RNA molecule from its termini. The major pathways of mRNA decay in eukaryotes are initiated by such exonucleolytic attack. In contrast, a circular RNA is a covalently closed continuous loop, and by definition, it lacks free $5'$ and $3'$ ends. This structure renders it inherently resistant to degradation by the majority of exonucleases that target linear RNAs. Because the primary degradation machinery for linear RNA is ineffective against circRNAs, their decay rate is significantly slower, resulting in a much longer operational half-life and greater stability within the cell. This differential stability is a key regulatory feature in gene expression, allowing a single gene to produce RNA isoforms with vastly different persistence times and, consequently, different functional potentials.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.000}$$", "id": "2799221"}, {"introduction": "Discovering novel circRNAs from vast RNA sequencing datasets hinges on a robust computational pipeline capable of identifying the unique back-splice junction (BSJ) signature.

Call a back-splice if both anchors from a single read map uniquely (mapping quality score $\\geq 20$) to the same annotated gene and strand, with the downstream genomic coordinate of the left anchor exceeding the upstream coordinate of the right anchor (reverse order), and with canonical splice dinucleotides flanking the putative donor and acceptor sites. Remove candidates where either anchor overlaps low-complexity or masked repeats.

This calculation provides a critical, objective criterion for evaluating the given options.\n\nNow, I will evaluate each option individually.\n\n**Option A Analysis:**\n- **Methodology**: This option proposes a pipeline that performs quality control, uses a splice-aware aligner in split/chimeric mode, and defines a back-splice junction correctly as two anchors from a single read mapping to the same gene and strand in reverse genomic order. This perfectly aligns with the problem's definition of circRNA detection from \"back-splice junction evidence from individual reads\".\n- **Filtering**: It includes several robust filtering steps essential for controlling false positives: requiring unique mapping (mapping quality score $\\geq 20$), checking for canonical splice dinucleotides (GT/AG), and removing candidates overlapping low-complexity or masked repeats. These steps directly address design goal (ii).\n- **Support**: Requiring at least $2$ supporting reads is a standard and sound practice to increase confidence in the identified circRNAs.\n- **$l_{\\min}$ Calculation**: It specifies $l_{\\min}=20$ nucleotides, which is precisely the value derived from the problem's statistical constraints.\n- **Constraints**: It adheres to the \"exact-match anchors\" constraint.\n\nVerdict: This option describes a state-of-the-art, robust, and theoretically sound pipeline for circRNA identification. It correctly calculates $l_{\\min}$ and satisfies all requirements and design goals of the problem statement. **Correct**.\n\n**Option B Analysis:**\n- **Methodology**: It proposes avoiding split alignment and instead using paired-end read mapping. This approach fails to use \"back-splice junction evidence from *individual reads*\" as specified in the problem statement and is a different, generally less precise method for circRNA detection.\n- **$l_{\\min}$ Calculation**: It sets $l_{\\min}=12$ nucleotides. As calculated, this value is far too low and would result in an expected number of background matches $E = (3 \\times 10^9) \\times 4^{-12} \\approx 178$, which is many orders of magnitude larger than the required $\\epsilon = 10^{-2}$.\n- **Constraints**: It violates the constraint that anchors must match exactly by allowing up to $2$ mismatches.\n- **Filtering**: It proposes weak filtering (no unique mapping requirement, no splice site check), which would lead to an unacceptably high false-positive rate.\n\nVerdict: This option is flawed on multiple fundamental grounds: it uses an incorrect methodology, violates the quantitative constraint on $l_{\\min}$, contradicts the exact-match anchor constraint, and employs poor filtering. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C Analysis:**\n- **Methodology**: It suggests using a fusion-finder for *intergenic* chimeras. This is conceptually wrong, as the vast majority of circRNAs are *intragenic*. It also incorrectly suggests ignoring strand and order, whereas a back-splice has a very specific reverse genomic order on the same strand.\n- **$l_{\\min}$ Calculation**: It sets $l_{\\min}=15$ nucleotides. This value violates the quantitative constraint, as $E = (3 \\times 10^9) \\times 4^{-15} \\approx 2.8$, which is significantly greater than $\\epsilon = 10^{-2}$.\n- **Support**: Requiring only $1$ supporting read is a very low threshold for confidence.\n\nVerdict: This option is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of circRNA biology and the appropriate tools for their detection. It also fails the quantitative test for $l_{\\min}$. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D Analysis:**\n- **Methodology**: It proposes alignment to the transcriptome only and, like option B, avoids split-read alignment in favor of a paired-end mapping strategy. This again contradicts the core task of using evidence from *individual reads*.\n- **$l_{\\min}$ Calculation**: This option completely fails to implement the per-anchor length constraint. Instead of a minimum length for each anchor, it requires a minimum total of $30$ bases. This would allow for a very short, non-specific anchor (e.g., $l=8$) to be paired with a longer one ($l=22$), defeating the statistical purpose of the $l_{\\min}$ constraint which is to ensure *each* anchor is sufficiently specific.\n- **Filtering**: It explicitly states \"do not filter repeats\", which is a recipe for a pipeline overwhelmed by false positives from repetitive elements in the genome.\n\nVerdict: This option fails to adhere to the specified methodology, misinterprets the critical statistical constraint on anchor length, and proposes a catastrophically poor filtering strategy. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option E Analysis:**\n- **Methodology**: The general approach is similar to option A. However, it introduces fatal exceptions.\n- **Constraints**: It violates the explicit problem constraint that \"anchor segments must match exactly\" by allowing up to $1$ mismatch.\n- **$l_{\\min}$ Calculation**: It sets $l_{\\min}=18$ nucleotides. This value fails the quantitative test, as $E = (3 \\times 10^9) \\times 4^{-18} \\approx 0.044$, which, while small, is still greater than the strict threshold of $\\epsilon = 10^{-2}$. The justification for using a smaller $l_{\\min}$ is not quantitatively supported.\n- **Filtering**: The reasoning to discard the canonical splice dinucleotide filter because of RNase R enrichment is scientifically weak. RNase R enriches for circular molecules, but it does not prove they were formed by splicing. The splice site information is a powerful, independent line of evidence that should not be discarded lightly.\n\nVerdict: This option violates two hard constraints given in the problem statement: the exact-match requirement and the calculated $l_{\\min}$ threshold. The reasoning provided is scientifically unsound. **Incorrect**.\n\nIn summary, Option A is the only choice that correctly interprets and satisfies all aspects of the problem statement, including the biological principles, the computational methodology, and the stringent quantitative constraints.

A candidate back-splice junction (BSJ) in gene $G$ is repeatedly detected, joining the splice donor of exon $E_{5}$ to the splice acceptor of exon $E_{3}$ of the same gene. However, two observations raise concern: (i) a subset of BSJ-spanning reads show short microhomologies of length $3$–$6$ nucleotides at the junction, and (ii) contiguous co-linear read coverage extends from the $3^{\\prime}$ end of gene $G$ into the adjacent downstream gene $H$ in the same transcriptional orientation, suggesting readthrough transcription. The laboratory also notes that low-abundance BSJ-supporting reads are present in polyadenylated [poly(A)$^{+}$]-selected libraries, and that External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC) spike-in controls (synthetic linear RNAs lacking introns) yield rare chimeric reads with short microhomology consistent with reverse transcription artifacts.\n\nFrom first principles of the Central Dogma (DNA $\\rightarrow$ RNA $\\rightarrow$ protein), cis-splicing within a single precursor messenger RNA removes introns and joins exons co-linearly, while circular RNA biogenesis by back-splicing uses spliceosomal machinery to join a downstream splice donor to an upstream splice acceptor within the same pre-messenger RNA, producing a covalently closed RNA lacking free $5^{\\prime}$ and $3^{\\prime}$ ends. Trans-splicing can join exons from distinct pre-messenger RNAs into a single linear chimera. Reverse transcriptase (RT) template switching can, during complementary DNA synthesis, jump between RNA templates or between positions on the same template, especially across short microhomologies, thereby generating artifactual chimeric complementary DNAs that can be misinterpreted as BSJ reads. Readthrough transcription can produce long primary transcripts that span tandem genes and increase the opportunity for RT template switching.\n\nWhich of the following options both correctly explain how trans-splicing and readthrough transcription followed by RT template switching could generate artifactual BSJ reads and propose experimental and computational measures that, together, are appropriate to rule them out for candidate circular RNAs? Select all that apply.\n\nA. Trans-splicing can yield bona fide linear chimeras whose exon order is not strictly co-linear relative to a single locus; when fragmented and sequenced, such reads can be misaligned as intragenic BSJs if paralogous exons or repetitive motifs cause ambiguous mapping. Readthrough transcripts spanning genes $G$ and $H$ increase the length of primary transcripts so that reverse transcriptase can switch from a downstream segment back to an upstream segment at a $3$–$6$ nucleotide microhomology, creating cDNAs that align as BSJs. To rule these out, combine RNase R treatment (to enrich covalently closed circles over linear RNAs), northern blotting with BSJ-spanning probes to demonstrate a discrete, RNase R-resistant species lacking poly(A), depletion in poly(A)$^{+}$-selected libraries relative to rRNA-depleted libraries, and targeted RNase H cleavage using a BSJ-spanning antisense oligonucleotide to linearize the circle and abolish the BSJ signal with appearance of a predicted linear product.\n\nB. Because circular RNAs are stable, they are preferentially captured by poly(A)$^{+}$ selection and oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcription; therefore, persistence or enrichment of the BSJ in poly(A)$^{+}$ libraries relative to rRNA-depleted libraries is the most specific hallmark of authentic circles. Computationally, include BSJs that are exclusively detected in poly(A)$^{+}$ datasets and remove those enriched by RNase R, which likely represent structured linear RNAs.\n\nC. Reverse transcriptase template switching can be quantified by ERCC spike-ins: if ERCCs produce chimeric junctions with short microhomology, that establishes a baseline false discovery rate. Computationally, filter BSJs by requiring that donor and acceptor map to the same gene and strand with canonical splice signals (donor GT and acceptor AG), that at least $2$ BSJ-spanning reads have distinct fragment start positions and anchor lengths $\\geq 20$ nucleotides on each side, and by removing junctions for which intergenic co-linear coverage connects genes $G$ and $H$ (indicative of readthrough). Down-weight or remove BSJs whose junctions exhibit short microhomology typical of template switching unless independently validated.\n\nD. Prepare replicate libraries from the same RNA using orthogonal reverse transcriptase chemistries and conditions that reduce artifactual template switching, such as including actinomycin D during complementary DNA synthesis to suppress DNA-dependent synthesis and choosing an enzyme and buffer formulation reported to minimize microhomology-mediated switching; true BSJ counts that remain stable across chemistries argue against RT artifacts. Pair this with RNase R enrichment and circle-specific northern blots to obtain orthogonal experimental support.\n\nE. Implement a readthrough-aware computational filter that flags putative BSJs when there is abundant co-linear coverage across the $G$–$H$ boundary and when paired-end mates frequently map on either side of the gene boundary in orientations consistent with a single long readthrough transcript. Retain BSJs that show a circular-to-linear ratio increase of at least $5$-fold after RNase R treatment relative to mock, whose supporting reads map uniquely with anchors $\\geq 20$ nucleotides on both sides, and whose support is not dominated ($>80\\%$) by a single library or a single fragment start site.\n\nF. DNase I pretreatment of RNA before reverse transcription reduces trans-splicing and reverse transcriptase template switching; therefore, observing loss of the BSJ signal after DNase I indicates that the BSJ was artifactual.

The observations—microhomology at the junction, read-through transcription, and low-level detection in poly(A)⁺ libraries—point towards RT template switching as a likely source of artifacts.\n\n- **Option A is correct.** It accurately describes how both trans-splicing and RT template switching (on long read-through transcripts) can create artifactual BSJ reads. It then proposes a gold-standard suite of orthogonal experimental validations: RNase R treatment to confirm resistance to exonucleolysis, Northern blotting with a BSJ-specific probe to verify the existence of a discrete circular molecule of the expected size, confirmation of depletion in poly(A)⁺ libraries (ruling out linear, polyadenylated molecules), and targeted RNase H cleavage to specifically linearize the circle and confirm its topology. Together, these methods provide definitive proof of a circRNA's existence.\n\n- **Option C is correct.** It outlines an essential and rigorous computational validation strategy. It correctly identifies the use of ERCC spike-ins to quantify RT-driven artifacts and proposes critical filters: requiring canonical splice signals (GT/AG), demanding sufficient non-redundant read support with long anchors (e.g., ≥20 nt), and flagging candidates associated with read-through transcription or microhomology at the junction. These steps are crucial for minimizing false positives from sequencing and alignment artifacts.\n\n- **Option D is correct.** It introduces a sophisticated experimental control for RT artifacts: using orthogonal reverse transcriptase chemistries. Because different RT enzymes have varying propensities for template switching, a true biological signal should be consistently detected across different enzymes, whereas an artifact may be enzyme-dependent. Combining this approach with standard methods like RNase R enrichment and Northern blotting provides a powerful, multi-pronged validation.\n\n- **Option E is correct.** It describes a set of advanced, quantitative computational filters that directly address the specific challenges mentioned.

DNase I treatment does not affect RNA splicing or artifacts generated during the RNA-to-cDNA reverse transcription step.\n\nTherefore, options A, C, D, and E collectively represent a comprehensive and correct strategy for the robust validation of circRNA candidates.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACDE}$$", "id": "2799197"}]}
