This first exercise challenges you to build a foundational model of adaptive introgression from first principles by deriving the deterministic recursion for an allele’s frequency.

[@problem_id:2789560]", "problem": "Consider a discrete-generation, two-deme Wright–Fisher model describing adaptive introgression of an allele from a donor population into a recipient population. Let the introgressed allele be denoted by $A$ and the alternative allele by $a$. Assume random mating within each deme, no mutation, and viability selection only in the recipient deme. Let $p_t$ denote the frequency of allele $A$ in the recipient population at the start of generation $t$, and let $p_{D,t}$ denote the frequency of allele $A$ in the donor population at the corresponding time. Each generation, a fraction $m$ of individuals in the recipient population are migrants originating from the donor population (the donor fraction received by the recipient is $m$ per generation). In the recipient environment, genotype viabilities are $w_{AA} = 1 + s$, $w_{Aa} = 1 + h s$, and $w_{aa} = 1$, where $s$ is the selection coefficient and $h$ is the dominance parameter. Assume panmixia within each deme so that genotype frequencies are in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) before viability selection, and take the infinite-population limit so that genetic drift is ignored and the recursion describes the expected allele frequency.\n\nAdopt the life cycle: migration into the recipient, random mating to HWE within the recipient, then viability selection in the recipient. Using only the definitions of HWE, viability selection acting proportionally to genotype fitnesses, and mass-action migration, derive from first principles the deterministic recursion for the expected allele frequency of $A$ in the recipient at the start of generation $t+1$ in terms of $p_t$, $p_{D,t}$, $m$, $s$, and $h$. Express your final recursion as a single closed-form algebraic expression for $p_{t+1}$ as a function of $p_t$, $p_{D,t}$, $m$, $s$, and $h$.

It provides an unambiguous description of a life cycle and asks for a deterministic recursion. We shall derive this recursion from first principles, following the specified sequence of events within a single generation, from time $t$ to $t+1$.\n\nLet $p_t$ be the frequency of allele $A$ in the recipient population at the start of generation $t$. Let $p_{D,t}$ be the corresponding frequency in the donor population. The life cycle consists of three events in order: migration, random mating, and viability selection.\n\nStep 1: Migration.\nA fraction $m$ of the recipient population is replaced by individuals from the donor population. The remaining fraction, $1-m$, consists of the original residents. The allele frequency of $A$ in the recipient population after migration, which we denote as $p'_t$, is the weighted average of the frequencies in the resident and migrant groups.\n$$p'_t = (1-m)p_t + m p_{D,t}$$\nThis frequency $p'_t$ is the allele frequency in the gene pool of the adult population that will now reproduce.\n\nStep 2: Random Mating and Zygote Formation.\nThe population mates randomly (panmixia). Under this assumption, the allele frequency in the pool of gametes produced by this generation is $p'_t$. The resulting zygotes for the next generation are formed with genotype frequencies according to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The frequencies of genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ among zygotes before selection are:\n$$ \\text{Freq}(AA)_{\\text{zygote}} = (p'_t)^2 $$\n$$ \\text{Freq}(Aa)_{\\text{zygote}} = 2p'_t(1-p'_t) $$\n$$ \\text{Freq}(aa)_{\\text{zygote}} = (1-p'_t)^2 $$\nNote that random mating itself does not alter the allele frequencies; the frequency of allele $A$ among the zygotes remains $p'_t$.\n\nStep 3: Viability Selection.\nSelection acts upon these zygotes. The relative viabilities (fitnesses) of the genotypes are given as $w_{AA} = 1+s$, $w_{Aa} = 1+hs$, and $w_{aa}=1$. The frequency of each genotype after selection is proportional to its initial frequency multiplied by its fitness.\nThe proportional frequencies after selection are:\n$$ \\text{Freq}'(AA) \\propto (p'_t)^2 (1+s) $$\n$$ \\text{Freq}'(Aa) \\propto 2p'_t(1-p'_t) (1+hs) $$\n$$ \\text{Freq}'(aa) \\propto (1-p'_t)^2 (1) $$\nTo find the actual frequencies, we must normalize by the mean fitness of the population, $\\bar{w}$. The mean fitness is the sum of the products of genotype frequencies before selection and their respective fitness values:\n$$ \\bar{w} = \\text{Freq}(AA)_{\\text{zygote}} w_{AA} + \\text{Freq}(Aa)_{\\text{zygote}} w_{Aa} + \\text{Freq}(aa)_{\\text{zygote}} w_{aa} $$\n$$ \\bar{w} = (p'_t)^2(1+s) + 2p'_t(1-p'_t)(1+hs) + (1-p'_t)^2 $$\nExpanding and simplifying this expression for $\\bar{w}$:\n$$ \\bar{w} = (p'_t)^2 + s(p'_t)^2 + 2p'_t(1+hs) - 2(p'_t)^2(1+hs) + 1 - 2p'_t + (p'_t)^2 $$\n$$ \\bar{w} = ((p'_t)^2 - 2(p'_t)^2 + (p'_t)^2) + (2p'_t - 2p'_t) + 1 + s(p'_t)^2 + 2hsp'_t - 2hs(p'_t)^2 $$\n$$ \\bar{w} = 1 + s(p'_t)^2 + 2hsp'_t(1-p'_t) $$\n\nStep 4: Derivation of the Recursion for $p_{t+1}$.\nThe frequency of allele $A$ at the start of the next generation, $p_{t+1}$, is the frequency of $A$ in the population after selection has acted. This is calculated from the frequencies of the genotypes that survive selection. The total frequency of allele $A$ is the frequency of the $AA$ genotype plus half the frequency of the $Aa$ genotype.\nThe frequency of $AA$ after selection is $\\frac{(p'_t)^2(1+s)}{\\bar{w}}$.\nThe frequency of $Aa$ after selection is $\\frac{2p'_t(1-p'_t)(1+hs)}{\\bar{w}}$.\nThus, $p_{t+1}$ is:\n$$ p_{t+1} = \\frac{(p'_t)^2(1+s)}{\\bar{w}} + \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{2p'_t(1-p'_t)(1+hs)}{\\bar{w}} \\right) $$\n$$ p_{t+1} = \\frac{(p'_t)^2(1+s) + p'_t(1-p'_t)(1+hs)}{\\bar{w}} $$\nLet us simplify the numerator of this expression:\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = (p'_t)^2 + s(p'_t)^2 + (p'_t - (p'_t)^2)(1+hs) $$\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = (p'_t)^2 + s(p'_t)^2 + p'_t + hsp'_t - (p'_t)^2 - hs(p'_t)^2 $$\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = p'_t + s(p'_t)^2 + hsp'_t(1-p'_t) $$\nCombining the simplified numerator and the expression for $\\bar{w}$, we have the recursion for $p_{t+1}$ in terms of $p'_t$:\n$$ p_{t+1} = \\frac{p'_t + s(p'_t)^2 + hsp'_t(1-p'_t)}{1 + s(p'_t)^2 + 2hsp'_t(1-p'_t)} $$\n\nStep 5: Final Expression.\nThe problem requires the final expression to be a function of $p_t$, $p_{D,t}$, $m$, $s$, and $h$. To achieve this, we substitute the expression for $p'_t$ from Step 1, $p'_t = (1-m)p_t + m p_{D,t}$, into the recursion derived in Step 4. This yields the final, single closed-form expression for $p_{t+1}$. Let the term $\\left((1-m)p_t + m p_{D,t}\\right)$ represent $p'_t$ in the equation above. The full recursion is:\n$$ p_{t+1} = \\frac{\\left((1-m)p_t + m p_{D,t}\\right) + s\\left((1-m)p_t + m p_{D,t}\\right)^2 + hs\\left((1-m)p_t + m p_{D,t}\\right)\\left(1 - \\left((1-m)p_t + m p_{D,t}\\right)\\right)}{1 + s\\left((1-m)p_t + m p_{D,t}\\right)^2 + 2hs\\left((1-m)p_t + m p_{D,t}\\right)\\left(1 - \\left((1-m)p_t + m p_{D,t}\\right)\\right)} $$\nThis is the complete and exact deterministic recursion under the specified model conditions.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\frac{\\left((1-m)p_t + m p_{D,t}\\right) + s\\left((1-m)p_t + m p_{D,t}\\right)^2 + hs\\left((1-m)p_t + m p_{D,t}\\right)\\left(1 - \\left((1-m)p_t + m p_{D,t}\\right)\\right)}{1 + s\\left((1-m)p_t + m p_{D,t}\\right)^2 + 2hs\\left((1-m)p_t + m p_{D,t}\\right)\\left(1 - \\left((1-m)p_t + m p_{D,t}\\right)\\right)} } $$", "id": "2789560"}, {"introduction": "Once an advantageous allele is introduced into a new population, its survival is not guaranteed due to genetic drift.

All necessary parameters and conditions—population size $N$, selection coefficient $s$, initial frequency $\\alpha$, and the genetic model of additive selection—are provided. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. I will therefore proceed with a rigorous derivation from first principles, as instructed.\n\nThe ultimate probability of fixation of an allele, which we denote as $u(p)$, starting from an initial frequency $p$, is described by the time-independent Kolmogorov backward equation. For a one-dimensional diffusion process with drift coefficient $M(p)$ and diffusion coefficient $V(p)$, this equation is a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} V(p) \\frac{d^2 u}{dp^2} + M(p) \\frac{du}{dp} = 0\n$$\nThis equation is solved subject to the boundary conditions that reflect the definition of fixation and loss. If the allele's frequency is $0$, it is lost, so its fixation probability is $0$. If its frequency is $1$, it is fixed, so its fixation probability is $1$.\n$$\nu(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad u(1) = 1\n$$\nTo solve this equation for the specific problem, we must first derive the drift and diffusion coefficients from the provided Wright-Fisher model with selection.\n\nThe diffusion coefficient, $V(p)$, represents the variance in allele frequency change per generation due to random genetic drift. In a diploid population of constant effective size $N$, there are $2N$ gene copies. The number of copies of allele $A$ in the next generation is obtained by binomial sampling from the current gene pool with frequency $p$. The variance of the allele frequency in the next generation is therefore:\n$$\nV(p) = \\frac{p(1-p)}{2N}\n$$\nThe drift coefficient, $M(p)$, represents the expected change in allele frequency per generation due to selection. Let $p$ be the frequency of allele $A$. The fitnesses of genotypes $aa$, $Aa$, and $AA$ are given as $w_{aa}=1$, $w_{Aa}=1+s$, and $w_{AA}=1+2s$. The mean fitness of the population, $\\bar{w}$, is the average of the genotype fitnesses weighted by their Hardy-Weinberg frequencies:\n$$\n\\bar{w} = (1-p)^2 w_{aa} + 2p(1-p) w_{Aa} + p^2 w_{AA}\n$$\nSubstituting the given fitness values:\n$$\n\\bar{w} = (1-p)^2(1) + 2p(1-p)(1+s) + p^2(1+2s)\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{w} = (1 - 2p + p^2) + (2p - 2p^2)(1+s) + p^2(1+2s)\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{w} = 1 - 2p + p^2 + 2p + 2sp - 2p^2 - 2sp^2 + p^2 + 2sp^2 = 1 + 2sp\n$$\nThe frequency of allele $A$ in the next generation, $p'$, is given by the frequency of alleles contributed by genotypes $Aa$ and $AA$:\n$$\np' = \\frac{p(1-p)w_{Aa} + p^2 w_{AA}}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{p(1-p)(1+s) + p^2(1+2s)}{1+2sp}\n$$\n$$\np' = \\frac{p - p^2 + sp - sp^2 + p^2 + 2sp^2}{1+2sp} = \\frac{p + sp + sp^2}{1+2sp}\n$$\nThe expected change in allele frequency, $\\Delta p$, is $p' - p$:\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{p + sp + sp^2}{1+2sp} - p = \\frac{p + sp + sp^2 - p(1+2sp)}{1+2sp}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{p + sp + sp^2 - p - 2sp^2}{1+2sp} = \\frac{sp - sp^2}{1+2sp} = \\frac{sp(1-p)}{1+2sp}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that selection is weak ($s$ is small), allowing for the diffusion approximation. In this limit, the denominator $1+2sp \\approx 1$.
