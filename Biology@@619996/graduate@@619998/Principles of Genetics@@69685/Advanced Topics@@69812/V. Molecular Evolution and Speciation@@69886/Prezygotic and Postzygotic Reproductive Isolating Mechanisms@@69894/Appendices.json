The function $g(t)=(t-8)^2-(t-12)^2$ has a derivative $g'(t)=2(t-8)-2(t-12)=8$, which is positive. Thus, $g(t)$ is strictly increasing. Since $g(10)=0$:\n- For $t < 10$, $g(t)<0$, which means $(t-8)^2 < (t-12)^2$. The exponent for $f_1(t)$ is greater (less negative) than for $f_2(t)$, thus $f_{1}(t) > f_{2}(t)$.

It is a standard problem in theoretical population genetics concerning the consequences of a Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility (DMI). Therefore, I will proceed with its formal derivation.\n\nThe objective is to derive the mean relative viability of the second filial (F$2$) generation, denoted $\\bar{w}_{\\text{F}2}(r,s)$, as a function of the recombination fraction $r$ and the selection coefficient $s$. The mean relative viability is the average of the relative viabilities of all genotypes in the population, weighted by their frequencies before selection.

All other genotypes have a relative viability of $1$. Let $P(\\text{incompatible})$ be the total frequency of all genotypes carrying at least one $A$ allele and at least one $B$ allele in the F$2$ generation before selection.

The F$1$ individuals are formed by a cross between species $1$ (genotype $AAbb$, fixed for haplotype $Ab$) and species $2$ (genotype $aaBB$, fixed for haplotype $aB$). The resulting F$1$ individuals are double heterozygotes with the genotype $AaBb$, specifically with the parental haplotypes in repulsion phase, which can be written as $Ab/aB$.\n\nDuring meiosis in these F$1$ individuals, recombination occurs between the two loci with a frequency $r$. The gametes produced are:\n-   Parental (non-recombinant) gametes: $Ab$ and $aB$. Their combined frequency is $1-r$. Thus, the frequency of each is $f(Ab) = f(aB) = \\frac{1-r}{2}$.\n-   Recombinant gametes: $AB$ and $ab$. Their combined frequency is $r$. Thus, the frequency of each is $f(AB) = f(ab) = \\frac{r}{2}$.\n\nThe F$2$ generation is produced by the random union of these gametes from the F$1$ population.
