{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A selective sweep leaves a characteristic footprint of reduced genetic diversity in the genomic region surrounding the beneficial allele. The physical size of this footprint is not arbitrary; it represents a fundamental tug-of-war between the speed of selection sweeping an allele to fixation and the rate of recombination trying to break down haplotypes. This exercise guides you through a first-principles derivation to estimate this \"sweep radius,\" connecting the core parameters of population genetics—selection strength ($s$), recombination rate ($r$), and effective population size ($N_e$)—to the tangible scale of a sweep's impact on the genome [@problem_id:2822133].", "problem": "A newly arisen advantageous allele undergoes a hard selective sweep in a large, panmictic diploid population with effective population size (denoted $N_e$). Assume genic selection (no dominance), so that in the deterministic limit the allele frequency $p(t)$ evolves according to the logistic differential equation $dp/dt = s\\,p(1-p)$, where $s$ is the selection coefficient and $t$ is measured in generations.

The problem is well-posed, providing a clear, self-contained definition for the quantity to be derived, $x^{\\ast}$, and all necessary parameters for its calculation. The language is objective and precise. The numerical values are plausible. Thus, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three stages: first, formalizing the definition of the sweep radius $x^{\\ast}$; second, calculating the duration of the selective sweep, $T_{\\text{sweep}}$; and third, combining these results to find an analytical and numerical value for $x^{\\ast}$.\n\nThe sweep radius $x^{\\ast}$ is defined by the condition that the expected number of recombination events on a single ancestral lineage tracked over the duration of the sweep is equal to $1$. Let $E$ be this expected number. The rate of recombination for a lineage at a site with recombination fraction $c$ is simply $c$ per generation. For a total duration of $T_{\\text{sweep}}$ generations, the expected number of events is the product of the rate and the duration:\n$$E = c \\times T_{\\text{sweep}}$$\nUsing the provided approximation $c \\approx r x$, the expected number of events at a distance $x$ is:\n$$E(x) \\approx r x T_{\\text{sweep}}$$\nThe condition for the sweep radius $x = x^{\\ast}$ is $E(x^{\\ast}) = 1$. Therefore, we have:\n$$r x^{\\ast} T_{\\text{sweep}} \\approx 1$$\nThis yields an expression for $x^{\\ast}$ that depends on the sweep duration:\n$$x^{\\ast} \\approx \\frac{1}{r T_{\\text{sweep}}}$$\n\nThe next step is to calculate $T_{\\text{sweep}}$. This is the time required for the allele frequency $p(t)$ to increase from its initial value $p_0 = \\frac{1}{2N_e}$ to its final value $p_1 = 1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}$.

You are told that the derived allele at a core single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) near the center of the region is at frequency $f_{d}=0.90$. To evaluate whether the signal is more consistent with a recent hard selective sweep at or near the core SNP versus a population bottleneck, you collect auxiliary measures of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype structure. Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) is measured by the squared correlation $r^2$ between pairs of SNPs, Extended Haplotype Homozygosity (EHH) is the probability that two randomly chosen chromosomes carrying a specified core allele are identical by state for all markers until a given distance, and the integrated Haplotype Score (iHS) compares the decay of EHH on the derived versus the ancestral background.

All provided concepts—Tajima's $D$, Fay and Wu's $H$, EHH, iHS, LD ($r^2$), selective sweeps, and population bottlenecks—are standard in the field of population genetics. The numerical values are internally consistent and realistic for a scenario of strong, recent positive selection. For instance, a strong sweep is expected to produce a negative Tajima's $D$, a strongly negative Fay and Wu's $H$, and a specific signature of long-range haplotypes and LD, all of which are described. The contrast between the focal region and the genome-wide background is critical and correctly formulated to allow discrimination between locus-specific effects (selection) and genome-wide effects (demography). The problem is self-contained, objective, and well-posed.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A rigorous analysis can proceed.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe task is to determine whether a recent hard selective sweep or a population bottleneck is more consistent with the provided data, and to identify the most diagnostic feature. We will analyze the evidence from first principles.\n\n1.  **Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS) Analysis**:\n    - Tajima's $D$ statistic compares two estimates of the population mutation parameter, $\\theta$: the average number of pairwise differences, $\\pi$, and the number of segregating sites, $S$. A negative $D$ (here, $D = -2.3$) indicates an excess of rare alleles compared to the standard neutral model. Both a recent selective sweep and a period of population growth following a bottleneck can produce negative Tajima's $D$. Therefore, this statistic is not sufficient on its own to distinguish between the two scenarios.\n    - Fay and Wu’s $H$ statistic compares $\\pi$ with an estimator based on the frequency of derived alleles. A strongly negative $H$ (here, $H = -5.1$) indicates a significant excess of high-frequency derived alleles. This is a classic signature of a selective sweep (hitchhiking), where a beneficial derived allele rises rapidly in frequency, dragging linked neutral derived alleles with it. A simple population bottleneck does not produce such a strong excess of high-frequency *derived* alleles in a specific genomic region. This statistic strongly favors selection over a bottleneck.\n\n2.  **Haplotype and Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) Analysis**:\n    The most decisive evidence comes from the haplotype structure and LD patterns, which differ fundamentally between a sweep and a bottleneck.\n    - **Bottleneck Effects**: A population bottleneck is a demographic event that affects the entire genome. It would cause a genome-wide increase in LD, a general reduction in diversity, and a shift in the entire SFS. The observation that control regions across the genome show neutral patterns (Tajima's $D \\approx 0$, $H \\approx 0$, normal LD decay) definitively rules out a recent, severe genome-wide bottleneck as the primary explanation for the signal in the focal region.\n    - **Selective Sweep Effects**: A selective sweep is a locus-specific event. A beneficial mutation arises on a particular chromosome (a single haplotype background). As this mutation sweeps to high frequency, the entire haplotype on which it resides hitchhikes with it. This process has several predictable consequences:\n        - **Extended Haplotype Homozygosity (EHH)**: The sweeping haplotype has not had time for recombination to break it down. Thus, it will be long and common. Haplotypes carrying the ancestral allele are older and have been subject to recombination for a longer time, so they are more diverse and shorter. The data show precisely this asymmetry: EHH on the high-frequency ($f_d=0.90$) derived allele background is high ($0.60$) and extends far ($\\approx 100$ kb), while EHH on the ancestral background decays rapidly ($0.10$ within $15$ kb).\n        - **Integrated Haplotype Score (iHS)**: The iHS statistic is designed specifically to detect such asymmetry. The observed large-magnitude negative value (iHS $= -2.7$) formally quantifies that the derived allele is associated with an unusually long haplotype, providing strong evidence for recent positive selection. The fact that this value is in the top $1\\%$ genome-wide confirms the signal is exceptional.\n        - **Pattern of LD ($r^2$)**: During a sweep, the hitchhiking effect creates strong LD (high $r^2$) among markers linked on the sweeping haplotype. This explains the high $r^2$ observed within the left and right flanks. However, recombination events that do occur during the sweep tend to happen between the sweeping haplotype and the diverse ancestral haplotypes. This shuffles the association between markers on opposite sides of the selected site, causing a characteristic breakdown of LD *across* the selected site. The observation of high $r^2$ within flanks but a sharp drop across the core SNP is a key diagnostic feature of a sweep, distinguishing it from demographic effects, which tend to increase LD more uniformly.\n\n3.  **Distinguishing Sweep Types**:\n    - **Hard vs. Soft Sweep**: The presence of a single, long, high-frequency haplotype is the classic signature of a \"hard sweep,\" where selection acts on a new mutation. A \"soft sweep\" from standing variation (where the allele was already present on multiple haplotype backgrounds) would result in several distinct haplotypes carrying the selected allele, leading to a weaker and more complex EHH/iHS signal. The data are most consistent with a hard sweep.\n    - **Recent vs. Ancient Sweep**: The great length of the haplotype ($\\approx 100$ kb) indicates the sweep was recent. Over time, recombination (at a rate of $1$ cM/Mb, or $10^{-5}$ per kb per generation) would break down this long-range association.\n\n**Conclusion**: All lines of evidence—particularly the localized nature of the signal and the specific patterns of allele-specific EHH, extreme iHS, and LD structure—point to a recent, hard selective sweep at the focal locus. A bottleneck is decisively ruled out by the genome-wide control data. The most diagnostic feature is the combination of haplotype and LD patterns that are unique to a recent sweep.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. A recent hard selective sweep centered near the core SNP; the most diagnostic LD feature is a single, unusually long, high-frequency derived haplotype with elevated EHH and high $r^2$ within flanks but a sharp drop in $r^2$ across the core site, localized to this region rather than genome-wide.**\n- This option correctly identifies the evolutionary scenario as a recent hard selective sweep. It also correctly identifies the most diagnostic feature: the specific combination of a long, high-frequency derived haplotype (evidenced by EHH and iHS) and the unique LD pattern ($r^2$ high within flanks but low across the core). This entire signature is localized, distinguishing it from genome-wide demographic events. This statement is fully consistent with our derivation.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. A recent severe population bottleneck; the most diagnostic LD feature is an increase in long-range LD and extended haplotypes restricted to the derived allele at the core SNP, with iHS strongly negative but localized to one region.**\n- This option incorrectly proposes a bottleneck. A bottleneck is a genome-wide phenomenon. The description of the \"diagnostic feature\" as being \"localized to one region\" and \"restricted to the derived allele\" contradicts the fundamental nature of a bottleneck. The explanation is internally inconsistent and refuted by the control region data.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. An ancient soft selective sweep from standing variation; the most diagnostic LD feature is multiple long, high-frequency haplotypes carrying the selected allele and approximately symmetric EHH decay for ancestral and derived core backgrounds.**\n- This option is incorrect on multiple counts. The sweep is recent, not ancient, given the long haplotype. It is a hard sweep, not a soft sweep, given the single dominant haplotype signature. The diagnostic feature described (multiple haplotypes, symmetric EHH) is characteristic of a soft sweep but is directly contradicted by the problem's data (asymmetric EHH, strong iHS).\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Background selection due to purifying selection on many linked deleterious sites; the most diagnostic LD feature is modestly reduced diversity with uniformly elevated LD across the region but without extreme iHS or allele-specific EHH asymmetry.**\n- This option incorrectly proposes background selection (BGS). BGS is a steady-state process that cannot produce the signatures of a rapid, recent event, such as an extremely negative Fay and Wu's $H$ or the highly asymmetric haplotype structure (extreme iHS). The diagnostic features described for BGS in this option are the opposite of what is observed in the data.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2822085"}]}
