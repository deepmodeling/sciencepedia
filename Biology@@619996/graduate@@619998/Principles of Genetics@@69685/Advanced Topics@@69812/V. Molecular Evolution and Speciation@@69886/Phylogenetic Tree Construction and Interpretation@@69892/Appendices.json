In phylogenetic inference under the principle of Maximum Parsimony (MP), a site is called parsimony-informative if its character-state distribution can discriminate among alternative unrooted tree topologies by implying different minimum numbers of state changes. For DNA characters with four possible nucleotides, assume the following interpretation from first principles: a site is parsimony-informative if and only if at least $2$ distinct nucleotides are present, and each of at least $2$ nucleotides occurs in at least $2$ taxa. Ambiguous characters denoted by N and gaps denoted by - are treated as missing data and do not contribute to counts; a site is counted as parsimony-informative only if the unambiguous observations alone satisfy the stated criterion.\n\nDefine, in your own words, what a parsimony-informative site is based on the above principle, and then compute the total number of parsimony-informative sites in the following alignment.

The provided definition is a correct and formal statement of the necessary and sufficient conditions for a site to be parsimony-informative in an analysis of $4$ taxa. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary data and a clear, unambiguous criterion for evaluation, ensuring a unique solution. It is objective and free of any scientific or logical flaws. The problem is therefore **valid**.\n\nProceeding to the solution.\n\nA parsimony-informative site, based on the provided principle, is a column in a sequence alignment that provides evidence to favor one unrooted phylogenetic tree topology over others. For $4$ taxa, there are $3$ possible unrooted trees. A site can discriminate among these trees only if it supports a specific grouping of taxa. This requires a character distribution where at least two taxa share one character state, and at least two other taxa share a different character state. The pattern is thus of the form `x-x-y-y`. Any other pattern, such as `x-x-x-x` (invariant), `x-x-x-y` (singleton), or `w-x-y-z` (all unique), will require the same minimum number of changes on all $3$ possible tree topologies and is thus uninformative for selecting the most parsimonious tree. The given rule is a formalization of this principle: for a site to be informative, it must contain at least two different character states, and at least two of those states must appear at least twice.\n\nWe analyze each of the $20$ sites according to this criterion, ignoring any `N` or `-` characters.\n\nLet $S_i$ be the set of characters at site $i$.

The strict consensus of a set of unrooted trees is the tree whose set of splits is the intersection of the split sets of all trees; equivalently, a split appears in the strict consensus if and only if it is present in all $N$ trees. The majority-rule consensus includes every split that appears in a strict majority of the trees, that is, in strictly more than $N/2$ trees. In both procedures, any parts of the topology not supported by the retained splits are represented as polytomies. For unrooted trees, two splits $A \\mid A'$ and $B \\mid B'$ are compatible if and only if at least one of the four intersections $A \\cap B$, $A \\cap B'$, $A' \\cap B$, $A' \\cap B'$ is empty. It is a well-known fact (and follows from a simple counting argument on incompatible splits) that no two incompatible splits can both exceed frequency $1/2$ in the same ensemble.\n\nWe analyze the strict consensus first. A split appears in the strict consensus if and only if it occurs in all $N = 1000$ trees. Inspecting the counts:\n\n- The split $\\{A,B\\} \\mid \\{C,D,E,F,G,H\\}$ occurs in $1000$ trees, so it is retained.\n- No other listed split has count $1000$, and we are told that all other nontrivial splits not listed occur in fewer than $200$ trees, hence none of them reaches $1000$.\n\nTherefore, the strict consensus contains exactly the split $\\{A,B\\} \\mid \\{C,D,E,F,G,H\\}$. This corresponds to exactly one internal bipartition (internal edge). All other relationships are unresolved and collapse to polytomies around the remaining taxa because no additional split is universally present. Thus, the number of internal bipartitions in the strict consensus is\n$$\nI_{\\text{strict}} = 1.\n$$\n\nNext, consider the majority-rule consensus. A split is included if it occurs in more than $N/2 = 500$ trees.

All unlisted splits occur in fewer than $200$ trees and so are also excluded.\n\nWe must verify that the included majority splits are pairwise compatible so that they can be simultaneously represented on a single unrooted tree.

Consequently, the majority-rule consensus contains exactly the following internal bipartitions: $\\{A,B\\} \\mid \\{C,D,E,F,G,H\\}$, $\\{A,B,C\\} \\mid \\{D,E,F,G,H\\}$, $\\{A,B,C,D\\} \\mid \\{E,F,G,H\\}$, and $\\{E,F\\} \\mid \\{A,B,C,D,G,H\\}$. Therefore, the number of internal bipartitions in the majority-rule consensus is\n$$\nI_{\\text{majority}} = 4.\n$$\n\nRegarding conflict resolution: in the strict consensus, every split that is not present in all $N$ trees is discarded; the nodes affected by such discarded splits expand into polytomies, representing uncertainty or conflict across the ensemble. Here, all relationships beyond the pair $\\{A,B\\}$ are not universal, so the taxa $\\{C,D,E,F,G,H\\}$ are connected in an unresolved polytomy relative to $\\{A,B\\}$. In the majority-rule consensus, splits that do not exceed the strict majority threshold, including mutually conflicting alternatives such as $\\{A,B,C\\} \\mid \\{D,E,F,G,H\\}$ versus $\\{A,B,D\\} \\mid \\{C,E,F,G,H\\}$, are excluded unless they surpass $N/2$. Since no two incompatible splits can both exceed frequency $1/2$, the included majority splits are compatible and define a partially resolved tree. Where no strict-majority split exists (for example, among $\\{G,H\\}$, which has frequency $490  500$), the corresponding portion of the tree remains a polytomy.\n\nFinally, the requested difference is\n$$\n\\Delta \\equiv I_{\\text{majority}} - I_{\\text{strict}} = 4 - 1 = 3.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "2837170"}, {"introduction": "Even the most sophisticated phylogenetic methods can be systematically misled, a phenomenon known as statistical inconsistency.

Sequence evolution follows a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) on nucleotides with time-reversible instantaneous rates at each site, but sites are drawn from a mixture in which a fraction $f$ of sites has equilibrium frequencies strongly adenine-thymine (AT)-biased and the remaining fraction $(1-f)$ has equilibrium frequencies strongly guanine-cytosine (GC)-biased. Rates vary across sites according to a Gamma distribution with shape parameter $\\alpha$, and there is lineage-specific rate acceleration along some terminals. The branch lengths (expected substitutions per site) on the true tree are as follows: the terminal branches to $A$, $B$, and $D$ are each approximately $0.10$, the terminal branch to $C$ is approximately $1.20$, the terminal branch to $O$ is approximately $1.50$, and the short internal branches within the ingroup are each approximately $0.05$.

It provides a valid basis for a rigorous analysis of phylogenetic methods. Therefore, a full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is Long-Branch Attraction (LBA). LBA is a systematic error in phylogenetic inference where two or more long branches (lineages that have undergone a large amount of evolution) are incorrectly inferred to be closely related. This occurs because, over long evolutionary time, the accumulation of multiple substitutions at the same site becomes probable. The probability distribution of the character state at the end of a very long branch approaches the equilibrium frequency distribution of the substitution process, irrespective of the ancestral state. Consequently, two long, unrelated branches have a higher-than-expected chance of independently evolving the same character states (homoplasy). Phylogenetic methods, particularly those that are inconsistent under model misspecification like Maximum Parsimony (MP), can mistake this convergent evolution for shared ancestry (synapomorphy).\n\nIn this problem, we have two long branches: the terminal branch leading to taxon $C$ (length $\\approx 1.20$) and the terminal branch leading to the outgroup $O$ (length $\\approx 1.50$). The true tree is $(O, ((A,B),(C,D)))$. In this true topology, $C$ and $O$ are distantly related. LBA will tend to group $C$ and $O$ together, producing an incorrect unrooted tree such as $((A,B),D,(C,O))$. When this unrooted tree is rooted using $O$ as the outgroup, the root of the ingroup is incorrectly placed on the branch separating $D$ from the $(A,B)$ clade, yielding an incorrect rooted ingroup topology of $((A,B),D)$ instead of the true $((A,B),(C,D))$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement based on these first principles.\n\n**A. Under these branch-length regimes, MP is expected to incorrectly group $O$ with $C$ due to LBA, thereby placing the root incorrectly within the ingroup.**\nMP seeks the tree that minimizes the total number of character-state changes. Consider a site where taxa $C$ and $O$ share a state not present in $A$, $B$, and $D$. The true tree requires at least two parallel changes (one on the branch to $C$, one on the branch to $O$) to explain this pattern. The incorrect LBA tree, which groups $(C,O)$, can explain this pattern with only a single change on the branch ancestral to the $(C,O)$ clade. Because the branches to $C$ and $O$ are long, the number of such sites with misleading convergent states is high. MP does not account for the high probability of multiple substitutions on long branches and will thus be systematically biased toward the incorrect topology that groups $C$ and $O$. As explained above, grouping the outgroup $O$ with the ingroup taxon $C$ leads directly to an incorrect placement of the ingroup root.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Fitting a site-homogeneous General Time Reversible (GTR) $+$ Gamma model and simply increasing the alignment length $L$ will eliminate the misrooting bias even if the outgroup remains highly divergent.**\nThe true data-generating process is described as being site-heterogeneous in its compositional properties: a fraction $f$ of sites are AT-biased and $(1-f)$ are GC-biased. The proposed GTR$+$Gamma model, while accounting for rate heterogeneity (the Gamma part), is site-homogeneous in its substitution process, meaning it assumes a single set of equilibrium base frequencies and a single rate matrix for all sites. This constitutes a model misspecification. In the presence of model misspecification, statistical methods like Maximum Likelihood (ML) are not guaranteed to be statistically consistent. Increasing the amount of data (alignment length $L$) will cause the method to converge with high confidence to the tree that best fits the data under the misspecified model, which may be, and in LBA scenarios often is, the incorrect tree. The compositional heterogeneity, if not modeled, can drive a spurious grouping of $C$ and $O$, and more data will only strengthen support for this wrong conclusion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Replacing the single divergent outgroup $O$ with $2$ moderately closer outgroups that together subtend the root (each with terminal length approximately $0.40$–$0.60$) reduces the risk of LBA-induced misrooting.**\nThis strategy is a form of \"breaking up long branches.\" The single long branch to outgroup $O$ (length $\\approx 1.50$) is a primary cause of the attraction. By replacing it with two less divergent outgroups, we are replacing one very long branch with several shorter branches. This reduces the number of sites that are saturated with substitutions on the path to the outgroups, thereby decreasing the amount of random noise and potential for convergence with the other long branch ($C$). This is a standard and effective strategy for combating LBA.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Adding $3$ additional taxa that subdivide the long branch leading to $C$ into shorter segments (without changing total path length) reduces the probability that $C$ will be spuriously attracted to $O$.**\nThis is the other primary strategy for mitigating LBA, often called \"improving taxon sampling.\" The long branch leading to $C$ (length $\\approx 1.20$) is the other source of attraction. Adding taxa that fall along this lineage breaks this one long branch into a series of shorter internal and terminal branches. This provides more phylogenetic constraints. A change that previously would have been interpreted as occurring somewhere along a single long branch is now localized to one of the new, shorter segments. This makes it much less likely for the method to incorrectly infer a spurious relationship between the more densely sampled clade containing $C$ and the distant outgroup $O$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Using a site-heterogeneous mixture over equilibrium frequency profiles (for example, a Dirichlet-process “CAT” model) can mitigate misrooting when convergent compositional biases on long branches drive spurious similarity.**\nThe problem states that the true generative process involves a mixture of compositional profiles across sites. A simple model assuming a single compositional profile is misspecified. A site-heterogeneous mixture model (like the CAT model, which approximates a Dirichlet process mixture of profiles) is explicitly designed to handle such compositional heterogeneity. It allows different sites to evolve under different equilibrium frequencies. If $C$ and $O$ exhibit convergent evolution due to, for instance, a shared GC-bias on their respective long branches, a site-homogeneous model misinterprets this as shared history. A CAT-like model can correctly attribute the excess of shared G/C states at some sites to a shared compositional preference at those sites, rather than to common ancestry. By more accurately modeling the evolutionary process, these models are more robust to LBA arising from compositional convergence.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**F. Recoding nucleotides into purines versus pyrimidines (purine/pyrimidine (RY) coding) and filtering the fastest-evolving sites can reduce, but not necessarily eliminate, LBA with a long outgroup.**\nLBA is driven by homoplasy resulting from multiple substitutions. Such substitutions accumulate most rapidly at the fastest-evolving sites. Filtering out these fast sites can remove a significant portion of the misleading signal, at the cost of losing some of the total phylogenetic information. RY coding transforms the 4-state nucleotide data into 2-state data (Purine R, Pyrimidine Y). Because transversions (purine $\\leftrightarrow$ pyrimidine changes) are typically rarer than transitions, the 2-state RY-coded data evolves more slowly and becomes saturated over longer evolutionary distances. This can preserve the deeper phylogenetic signal that has been erased by multiple substitutions in the original nucleotide data. Both are well-known heuristic methods to mitigate LBA. However, they are not a panacea; they discard information and may not be sufficient in extreme cases. The phrasing \"can reduce, but not necessarily eliminate\" is therefore accurate.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**G. Choosing an even more distant single outgroup (terminal length approximately $2.50$) strengthens the rooting signal and is recommended to combat LBA.**\nThis is precisely the opposite of what should be done. The outgroup branch is already long (length $\\approx 1.50$), contributing to LBA. Increasing its length to $\\approx 2.50$ will make it even more divergent, increasing the probability of random sequence convergence with the other long branch ($C$). This will exacerbate, not combat, LBA and make the rooting even less reliable. An ideal outgroup is the closest possible relative to the ingroup, as this minimizes the outgroup branch length while still ensuring it falls outside the ingroup.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**H. Employing a nonreversible substitution model or a relaxed molecular clock with appropriate calibrations can, if model fit is adequate, reduce dependence on the outgroup for root placement and thereby mitigate outgroup-induced misrooting.**\nFor a time-reversible CTMC model, the likelihood of the data on an unrooted tree is independent of the root's position. Therefore, the root cannot be inferred from the ingroup data alone; an outgroup is required. If the evolutionary process is not time-reversible, this symmetry is broken. The likelihood of the data will then depend on the root's position, allowing the root to be inferred, in principle, from the ingroup sequences. Similarly, a relaxed molecular clock model posits that rates of evolution vary across the tree. If calibrated or structured appropriately, the model can identify the root position by finding the placement that best explains the observed distribution of branch lengths under the clock model's assumptions. Both approaches can provide evidence for the root's location that is independent of the outgroup, thus mitigating rooting errors caused by LBA involving a problematic outgroup. The clause \"if model fit is adequate\" is crucial, as using these more complex models when they are not justified can lead to other errors.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACDEFH}$$", "id": "2837197"}]}
