These weights depend on the standardized residuals $u_i = \\frac{x_i - T_0}{s}$. The weight function is Tukey's bisquare (or biweight) function, defined with a tuning constant $c=4.685$:\n$$w(u_i) = \\begin{cases} \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{u_i}{c}\\right)^2\\right)^2 & \\text{if } |u_i| \\leq c \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } |u_i| > c \\end{cases}$$\nWe calculate the standardized residuals $u_i$:\n\\begin{align*} u_1 = \\frac{8.00 - 8.06}{0.044478} \\approx -1.34898 \\\\ u_2 = \\frac{8.02 - 8.06}{0.044478} \\approx -0.89932 \\\\ u_3 = \\frac{8.03 - 8.06}{0.044478} \\approx -0.67449 \\\\ u_4 = \\frac{8.04 - 8.06}{0.044478} \\approx -0.44966 \\\\ u_5 = \\frac{8.05 - 8.06}{0.044478} \\approx -0.22483 \\\\ u_6 = \\frac{8.06 - 8.06}{0.044478} = 0 \\\\ u_7 = \\frac{8.07 - 8.06}{0.044478} \\approx 0.22483 \\\\ u_8 = \\frac{8.08 - 8.06}{0.044478} \\approx 0.44966 \\\\ u_9 = \\frac{8.09 - 8.06}{0.044478} \\approx 0.67449 \\\\ u_{10} = \\frac{8.10 - 8.06}{0.044478} \\approx 0.89932 \\\\ u_{11} = \\frac{12.00 - 8.06}{0.044478} \\approx 88.58290 \\end{align*}\nFor the aberrant probe, $|u_{11}| \\approx 88.58 > c = 4.685$. Therefore, its weight $w_{11}$ is $0$. For all other probes, $|u_i| \\leq |-1.34898| < 4.685$, so they receive non-zero weights.

The formula is given as:\n$$I_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{n\\,w_{\\text{ab}}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}$$\nHere, $n=11$, $w_{\\text{ab}}$ is the weight of the aberrant probe $x_{11}$, so $w_{\\text{ab}} = w_{11} = 0$.\n$$I_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{11 \\times 0}{9.568457} = 0$$\nThe value is exactly $0$. Rounding to four significant figures is not applicable to an exact value of zero; however, to maintain a consistent format for reporting numerical results, we express it as $0.0000$.\n\nThe final answer consists of the two computed values: the gene-level summary and the relative influence.\n1.

The tasks—calculating Pearson correlation and OLS regression parameters—are standard statistical procedures that yield a unique solution from the given data.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective, technical language, free from subjective or speculative content.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is found to be valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. We will proceed to derive the solution from first principles.\n\nThe solution requires the computation of several summary statistics from the data. Let the sample size be $n = 20$. We must first calculate the sums of $x_i$, $y_i$, their squares, and their cross-products.\n\nThe sum of the microarray values, $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$:\nThe values for $x_i$ are symmetric around $0$.\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{20} x_i = (-5.0 - 4.5 - \\dots - 0.5) + (0.5 + 1.0 + \\dots + 5.0) = 0 $$\nThe sample mean of $x$ is therefore $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \\frac{0}{20} = 0$.\n\nThe sum of the qPCR values, $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{20} y_i = (-3.8 - 3.4 - \\dots - 0.2) + (0.6 + 1.0 + \\dots + 4.2) = -20.0 + 24.0 = 4.0 $$\nThe sample mean of $y$ is $\\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i = \\frac{4.0}{20} = 0.2$.\n\nThe sum of squares of the microarray values, $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{20} x_i^2 = 2 \\times \\left( 0.5^2 + 1.0^2 + 1.5^2 + \\dots + 5.0^2 \\right) $$\n$$ = 2 \\times (0.25+1.0+2.25+4.0+6.25+9.0+12.25+16.0+20.25+25.0) = 2 \\times 96.25 = 192.5 $$\n\nThe sum of squares of the qPCR values, $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i^2$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{20} y_i^2 = (-3.8)^2 + (-3.4)^2 + \\dots + (3.8)^2 + (4.2)^2 $$\n$$ = (14.44+11.56+9.00+6.76+4.84+3.24+1.96+1.00+0.36+0.04) + (0.36+1.00+1.96+3.24+4.84+6.76+9.00+11.56+14.44+17.64) $$\n$$ = 53.2 + 70.8 = 124.0 $$\n\nThe sum of the cross-products, $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{20} x_i y_i = (-5.0)(-3.8) + (-4.5)(-3.4) + \\dots + (5.0)(4.2) $$\n$$ = (19.0+15.3+12.0+9.1+6.6+4.5+2.8+1.5+0.6+0.1) + (0.3+1.0+2.1+3.6+5.5+7.8+10.5+13.6+17.1+21.0) $$\n$$ = 71.5 + 82.5 = 154.0 $$\n\nNow we compute the requested quantities.\n\n**Pearson Correlation Coefficient ($r$)**\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient is defined as $r = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(x,y)}{\\sigma_x \\sigma_y}$. Using the calculated sums:\n$$ r = \\frac{n \\sum x_i y_i - (\\sum x_i)(\\sum y_i)}{\\sqrt{\\left[n \\sum x_i^2 - (\\sum x_i)^2\\right] \\left[n \\sum y_i^2 - (\\sum y_i)^2\\right]}} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ r = \\frac{20(154.0) - (0)(4.0)}{\\sqrt{\\left[20(192.5) - (0)^2\\right] \\left[20(124.0) - (4.0)^2\\right]}} $$\n$$ r = \\frac{3080}{\\sqrt{[3850] [2480 - 16]}} = \\frac{3080}{\\sqrt{3850 \\times 2464}} = \\frac{3080}{\\sqrt{9486400}} = \\frac{3080}{3080} = 1.0 $$\nA correlation of $1.0$ indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, as expected for these data which fall perfectly on a line.\n\n**Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Calibration Line**\nThe OLS regression line $y = a + b x$ is determined by the slope $b$ and intercept $a$.\n\nThe slope $b$ is defined as $b = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(x,y)}{\\text{Var}(x)}$. Using the calculated sums:\n$$ b = \\frac{n \\sum x_i y_i - (\\sum x_i)(\\sum y_i)}{n \\sum x_i^2 - (\\sum x_i)^2} $$\nSince $\\sum x_i = 0$, the formula simplifies to:\n$$ b = \\frac{n \\sum x_i y_i}{n \\sum x_i^2} = \\frac{\\sum x_i y_i}{\\sum x_i^2} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ b = \\frac{154.0}{192.5} = 0.8 $$\n\nThe intercept $a$ is defined as $a = \\bar{y} - b \\bar{x}$.\nSince $\\bar{x}=0$:\n$$ a = \\bar{y} - b(0) = \\bar{y} $$\nSubstituting the value for $\\bar{y}$:\n$$ a = 0.2 $$\nThe OLS calibration line is therefore $y = 0.2 + 0.8x$.\n\n**Assessment of Systematic Bias**\nAn ideal calibration would yield $y=x$, corresponding to an intercept $a=0$ and a slope $b=1$.\n- **Additive Bias**: The intercept $a = 0.2$ is non-zero. This represents a systematic additive bias. It indicates that when the microarray platform reports a log-fold-change of $0$, the qPCR platform reports a log-fold-change of $0.2$. This is a positive additive bias, suggesting qPCR values are systematically shifted upwards relative to microarray values.\n- **Proportional Bias**: The slope $b = 0.8$ is not equal to $1$. This represents a systematic proportional bias. Since $b  1$, it signifies a compression of the dynamic range of qPCR measurements relative to microarray measurements (or, equivalently, an expansion of the microarray's dynamic range relative to qPCR). For each unit increase in microarray log-fold-change, the qPCR log-fold-change increases by only $0.8$ units.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of the calibration slope $b$ rounded to four significant figures.\nThe calculated slope is $b = 0.8$. Expressed to four significant figures, this value is $0.8000$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8000}$$", "id": "2805327"}]}
