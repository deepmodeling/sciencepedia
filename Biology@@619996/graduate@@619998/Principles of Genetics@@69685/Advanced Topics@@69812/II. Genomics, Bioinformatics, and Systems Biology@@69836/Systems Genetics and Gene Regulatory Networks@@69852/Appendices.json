The denominator, $[\\text{P}] + [\\text{TF}\\cdot\\text{P}]$, represents the total promoter concentration, $[\\text{P}]_{\\mathrm{total}}$.\n- An approximation is made: the total promoter concentration is negligible compared to the total transcription factor concentration, therefore the free transcription factor concentration, $[\\text{TF}]$, is effectively constant and equal to the total nuclear TF concentration.\n- The task is to derive an expression for $P_{\\mathrm{bound}}$ as a function of $K_d$ and $[\\text{TF}]$.\n- Numerical values are provided for evaluation: $K_d = 20\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and $[\\mathrm{TF}] = 30\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n- The final numerical answer must be an exact fraction.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is assessed for its validity.\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is well-grounded in the principles of chemical kinetics and molecular biology. The model described is a standard, simplified representation of transcription factor-promoter binding, often referred to as the Hill-Langmuir isotherm for a single site. The assumptions of quasi-equilibrium and negligible TF depletion are common and valid approximations in this context.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides clear definitions, sufficient data, and a specific objective. A unique and meaningful solution can be determined.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using objective and precise scientific language.\n\nThe problem is free of scientific unsoundness, ambiguity, and internal contradictions. All givens are consistent and sufficient for deriving a solution.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation begins from the provided first principles: the definition of the dissociation constant, $K_d$, and the definition of fractional occupancy, $P_{\\mathrm{bound}}$. The objective is to express $P_{\\mathrm{bound}}$ in terms of $[\\text{TF}]$ and $K_d$.\n\nThe dissociation constant is given by:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[\\text{TF}][\\text{P}]}{[\\text{TF}\\cdot\\text{P}]}$$\nHere, $[\\text{P}]$ is the concentration of the free (unbound) promoter and $[\\text{TF}\\cdot\\text{P}]$ is the concentration of the bound complex. We can rearrange this equation to express the concentration of the free promoter in terms of the bound complex and other parameters:\n$$[\\text{P}] = K_d \\frac{[\\text{TF}\\cdot\\text{P}]}{[\\text{TF}]}$$\n\nThe fractional occupancy, which represents the probability of the promoter being bound, is defined as the ratio of the concentration of bound promoter to the total concentration of promoter:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\frac{[\\text{TF}\\cdot\\text{P}]}{[\\text{P}]_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{[\\text{TF}\\cdot\\text{P}]}{[\\text{P}] + [\\text{TF}\\cdot\\text{P}]}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $[\\text{P}]$ from the rearranged $K_d$ equation into the denominator of the $P_{\\mathrm{bound}}$ equation:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\frac{[\\text{TF}\\cdot\\text{P}]}{\\left(K_d \\frac{[\\text{TF}\\cdot\\text{P}]}{[\\text{TF}]}\\right) + [\\text{TF}\\cdot\\text{P}]}$$\n\nThe term $[\\text{TF}\\cdot\\text{P}]$ appears in the numerator and in both terms of the denominator. Assuming a non-zero concentration of transcription factor, which implies a non-zero possibility of binding, $[\\text{TF}\\cdot\\text{P}]$ is not zero and can be factored out from the denominator and cancelled:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\frac{[\\text{TF}\\cdot\\text{P}]}{[\\text{TF}\\cdot\\text{P}] \\left(\\frac{K_d}{[\\text{TF}]} + 1\\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[\\text{TF}]} + 1}$$\n\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we find a common denominator for the terms in the denominator:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d + [\\text{TF}]}{[\\text{TF}]}}$$\n\nFinally, inverting the denominator yields the expression for $P_{\\mathrm{bound}}$ in terms of $K_d$ and $[\\text{TF}]$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\frac{[\\text{TF}]}{K_d + [\\text{TF}]}$$\nThis is the required analytical expression.

A fixed point is stable if $f'(x^\\ast) < 0$ and unstable if $f'(x^\\ast) > 0$. The derivative of $f(x)$ is found using the quotient rule:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = \\alpha \\frac{nK^n x^{n-1}}{(K^n + x^n)^2} - \\beta\n$$\nWe must analyze the stability of each fixed point.\n\nFirst, consider the trivial fixed point $x^\\ast_0 = 0$. Its stability depends on the value of $n$.\n- If $n > 1$, then $n-1 > 0$. The term $x^{n-1}$ evaluates to $0$ at $x=0$, so $f'(0) = \\alpha \\cdot 0 - \\beta = -\\beta$. Since $\\beta > 0$, we have $f'(0) < 0$. Thus, for $n > 1$, the fixed point $x^\\ast_0 = 0$ is always stable.\n- If $n = 1$, the derivative is $f'(x) = \\alpha \\frac{K}{(K+x)^2} - \\beta$. At $x=0$, this gives $f'(0) = \\frac{\\alpha}{K} - \\beta$. The stability of $x^\\ast_0 = 0$ for $n=1$ depends on the parameters: it is stable if $\\frac{\\alpha}{K} < \\beta$ and unstable if $\\frac{\\alpha}{K} > \\beta$.\n\nTo find all non-negative fixed points and assess their stability for each given parameter set, a numerical algorithm is employed.\n1. Define the functions $f(x)$ and $f'(x)$ for the given parameters $(\\alpha, \\beta, K, n)$.\n2. The search for positive fixed points can be restricted to a finite interval. A fixed point $x^\\ast$ must satisfy $\\beta x^\\ast = \\alpha \\frac{(x^\\ast)^n}{K^n + (x^\\ast)^n}$. Since the Hill function term is strictly less than $1$ for any finite $x^\\ast$, we must have $\\beta x^\\ast < \\alpha$, which implies $x^\\ast < \\alpha / \\beta$. Therefore, all positive fixed points are guaranteed to lie in the interval $(0, \\alpha/\\beta)$. We can safely choose our search interval to be $[0, \\alpha/\\beta]$ to find all non-negative fixed points.\n3. We systematically search for roots of $f(x)$ in the interval $(0, \\alpha/\\beta]$. A robust method is to partition the interval into a fine grid and detect sign changes of $f(x)$ between adjacent grid points. A sign change indicates the presence of a root, which can be located precisely using a standard root-finding algorithm like Brent's method.\n4. All found positive roots, along with the trivial root $x^\\ast_0=0$, constitute the complete set of non-negative fixed points.\n5. For each fixed point $x^\\ast$ in this set, we compute the derivative $f'(x^\\ast)$ and check its sign.\n6. The total number of fixed points is computed. The number of stable fixed points (where $f'(x^\\ast) < 0$) is also counted.\n7. The system exhibits multiple stable states if the count of stable fixed points is at least two.\n\nThis procedure, implemented programmatically, allows for a definitive analysis of each test case.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import brentq\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the fixed points and stability of a single-gene positive autoregulatory module.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        (50., 1., 5., 3.),  # Case 1\n        (2., 1., 5., 1.),   # Case 2\n        (10., 1., 5., 1.),  # Case 3\n        (5., 1., 5., 3.),   # Case 4\n        (20., 1., 3., 4.)   # Case 5\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        alpha, beta, K, n = case\n\n        # Define the function f(x) whose roots are the fixed points.\n        def f(x):\n            if x < 0:\n                return np.inf  # Domain is x >= 0\n            # To prevent overflow with large x and n, handle the Hill term carefully.\n            # However, for the given constraints, standard float precision is sufficient.\n            return alpha * (x**n) / (K**n + x**n) - beta * x\n\n        # Define the derivative f'(x) for stability analysis.\n        def f_prime(x):\n            if x < 0:\n                return np.inf\n            if n == 1:\n                # Correct handling for n=1 to avoid 0^0 issues at x=0\n                return alpha * K / (K + x)**2 - beta\n            else:\n                # General case for n > 1\n                numerator = alpha * n * (K**n) * (x**(n - 1))\n                denominator = (K**n + x**n)**2\n                return numerator / denominator - beta\n\n        # 1.

Since $\\hat{\\beta}_{YG}$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_{EG}$ are from non-overlapping samples, they are independent random variables. The variance of their ratio can be approximated using the first-order Taylor series expansion (the Delta method). For a function $f(x, y) = x/y$, the variance is approximated as:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{X}{Y}\\right) \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\mu_X}{\\mu_Y}\\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(X)}{\\mu_X^2} + \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(Y)}{\\mu_Y^2} \\right) $$\nApplying this to our estimates, where $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}) = \\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\beta})^2$:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{MR}}) \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_{YG}}{\\hat{\\beta}_{EG}}\\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{YG})^2}{\\hat{\\beta}_{YG}^2} + \\frac{\\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{EG})^2}{\\hat{\\beta}_{EG}^2} \\right) $$\nA more direct and commonly used form derived from the Delta method is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{MR}}) \\approx \\frac{\\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{YG})^2}{\\hat{\\beta}_{EG}^2} + \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_{YG}^2 \\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{EG})^2}{\\hat{\\beta}_{EG}^4} $$\nWe will use this formulation.

Given the assumption of large-sample normality, the test statistic $Z$ follows a standard normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ under the null hypothesis.\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{MR}} - 0}{\\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{MR}})} = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{MR}}}{\\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{MR}})} $$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$ Z \\approx \\frac{0.4}{0.144222051...} \\approx 2.77350098... $$\nThe two-sided p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as $|Z|$:\n$$ p = 2 \\times P(Z_{std} \\ge |Z|) = 2 \\times (1 - \\Phi(|Z|)) $$\nwhere $\\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.\n$$ p \\approx 2 \\times (1 - \\Phi(2.7735)) \\approx 2 \\times (1 - 0.99723) \\approx 2 \\times 0.00277 = 0.00554 $$\n\nFinally, we report the results rounded to three significant figures as a row vector $[\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{MR}}, \\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{MR}}), p]$.\n- $\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{MR}} = 0.4$ rounded to three significant figures is $0.400$.\n- $\\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{MR}}) \\approx 0.14422...$ rounded to three significant figures is $0.144$.\n- $p \\approx 0.00554$ (already has three significant figures, $5, 5, 4$).\n\nThe final result is the vector $[0.400, 0.144, 0.00554]$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.400 & 0.144 & 0.00554 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2854802"}]}
