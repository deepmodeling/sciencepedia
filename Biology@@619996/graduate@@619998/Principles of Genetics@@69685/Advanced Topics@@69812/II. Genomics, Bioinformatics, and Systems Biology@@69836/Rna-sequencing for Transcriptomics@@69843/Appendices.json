It is scientifically grounded in the standard principles of bioinformatics, specifically the Phred quality score used in DNA/RNA sequencing. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution. No contradictions, ambiguities, or logical flaws are present. We may proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental principle connecting the Phred quality score, $Q$, to the probability of an incorrect base call, $P$, is given by the definition:\n$$ Q = -10 \\log_{10}(P) $$\nFrom this definition, we must first derive the expression for the error probability $P$ as a function of $Q$. Rearranging the equation, we find:\n$$ P = 10^{-Q/10} $$\nThis probability, $P$, represents the expected error rate for a single base call with quality score $Q$.\n\nThe problem specifies a read of total length $L=150$ nucleotides, which is partitioned into three segments, each with a constant median Phred quality score. Let us denote the length of segment $i$ as $n_i$ and its quality score as $Q_i$.\nFor the first segment (cycles $1-60$):\nThe number of bases is $n_1 = 60 - 1 + 1 = 60$.\nThe Phred quality score is $Q_1 = 36$.\nThe probability of error per base in this segment is $P_1 = 10^{-Q_1/10} = 10^{-36/10} = 10^{-3.6}$.\n\nFor the second segment (cycles $61-120$):\nThe number of bases is $n_2 = 120 - 61 + 1 = 60$.\nThe Phred quality score is $Q_2 = 32$.\nThe probability of error per base in this segment is $P_2 = 10^{-Q_2/10} = 10^{-32/10} = 10^{-3.2}$.\n\nFor the third segment (cycles $121-150$):\nThe number of bases is $n_3 = 150 - 121 + 1 = 30$.\nThe Phred quality score is $Q_3 = 25$.\nThe probability of error per base in this segment is $P_3 = 10^{-Q_3/10} = 10^{-25/10} = 10^{-2.5}$.\nThe total length of the read is indeed $L = n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = 60 + 60 + 30 = 150$, which is consistent with the provided information.\n\nThe expected number of errors in a sequence of base calls is governed by the principle of linearity of expectation. If we define an indicator random variable $X_i$ for each position $i$ in the read, such that $X_i=1$ if an error occurs and $X_i=0$ otherwise, then the expected value of $X_i$ is $E[X_i] = (1 \\cdot P(X_i=1)) + (0 \\cdot P(X_i=0)) = p_i$, where $p_i$ is the error probability at position $i$. The total expected number of errors for the entire read, $E_{\\text{read}}$, is the sum of the individual expectations:\n$$ E_{\\text{read}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} E[X_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} p_i $$\nApplying this to our segmented model, we sum the constant error probabilities over their respective segments:\n$$ E_{\\text{read}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{60} P_1 + \\sum_{i=61}^{120} P_2 + \\sum_{i=121}^{150} P_3 $$\nThis simplifies to the sum of the products of the number of bases and the error probability for each segment:\n$$ E_{\\text{read}} = n_1 P_1 + n_2 P_2 + n_3 P_3 $$\nThis is the expression for the expected number of base-calling errors per read.\n\nThe first requested quantity, the expected base-call error rate per base for the read, averaged across all positions, $\\bar{P}$, is the total expected number of errors divided by the total length of the read:\n$$ \\bar{P} = \\frac{E_{\\text{read}}}{L} = \\frac{n_1 P_1 + n_2 P_2 + n_3 P_3}{L} $$\nThe second requested quantity is $E_{read}$ itself. The problem asks for the numerical value of $E_{read}$.\n\nWe now substitute the specific values into the derived expression for $E_{read}$:\n$$ E_{\\text{read}} = 60 \\cdot 10^{-3.6} + 60 \\cdot 10^{-3.2} + 30 \\cdot 10^{-2.5} $$\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we calculate the terms:\n$10^{-3.6} \\approx 0.0002511886$\n$10^{-3.2} \\approx 0.0006309573$\n$10^{-2.5} \\approx 0.0031622777$\nSubstituting these values:\n$$ E_{\\text{read}} \\approx 60 \\cdot (0.0002511886) + 60 \\cdot (0.0006309573) + 30 \\cdot (0.0031622777) $$\n$$ E_{\\text{read}} \\approx 0.015071316 + 0.037857438 + 0.094868331 $$\n$$ E_{\\text{read}} \\approx 0.147797085 $$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures. The first significant figure is $1$ in the tenths place. The four significant figures are $1, 4, 7, 7$. The fifth significant figure is $9$, which requires rounding up the fourth digit.\nTherefore, the expected number of base-calling errors per read is approximately $0.1478$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.1478}\n$$", "id": "2848935"}, {"introduction": "At the heart of differential expression analysis lies a robust statistical framework for handling the unique properties of RNA-seq count data.

The validity of the problem statement is confirmed as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of transcriptomics and biostatistics, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is formulated objectively. The described model and algorithm are standard in the field of differential gene expression analysis.\n\nThe core of the problem is to fit a Negative Binomial (NB) Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to gene expression counts. The biological premise, rooted in the Central Dogma, is that mRNA abundance, measured by RNA-seq read counts, reflects gene expression levels. The count data $Y_i$ for each sample $i$ is modeled as a random variable following a Negative Binomial distribution.\n\nThe model specification is as follows:\nThe mean $\\mu_i = E[Y_i]$ is related to a set of covariates $\\boldsymbol{x}_i$ through a log link function, with an offset term $o_i$ to account for variations in library size (sequencing depth) across samples. The linear predictor $\\eta_i$ and the mean $\\mu_i$ are given by:\n$$ \\eta_i = \\boldsymbol{x}_i^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + o_i $$\n$$ \\mu_i = \\exp(\\eta_i) $$\nHere, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is the vector of regression coefficients to be estimated, and the offset $o_i$ is defined as the logarithm of the library size factor $s_i$, i.e., $o_i = \\log s_i$.\n\nThe variance of the NB distribution, under the NB2 parameterization, is related to the mean by:\n$$ V(Y_i) = \\mu_i + \\alpha \\mu_i^2 $$\nwhere $\\alpha > 0$ is the dispersion parameter, which captures biological and technical variability beyond what is expected from a Poisson model (where variance equals the mean). A fixed value of $\\alpha$ is provided for each test case.\n\nTo estimate the coefficient vector $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, we employ the Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) algorithm. IRLS is a numerical method that finds the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) of $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ by iteratively solving a series of weighted least squares (WLS) problems. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: The algorithm starts with an initial guess for the coefficients, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(0)}$. A standard and simple choice is $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(0)} = \\boldsymbol{0}$.\n\n2.  **Iteration**: At each iteration $t$, given the current estimate $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(t-1)}$, we compute the following quantities for each sample $i=1, \\dots, n$:\n    -   The linear predictor: $\\eta_i^{(t-1)} = \\boldsymbol{x}_i^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(t-1)} + o_i$.\n    -   The fitted mean value: $\\mu_i^{(t-1)} = \\exp(\\eta_i^{(t-1)})$.\n    -   The pseudo-response or \"working dependent variable\": $z_i^{(t-1)} = \\eta_i^{(t-1)} + \\dfrac{y_i - \\mu_i^{(t-1)}}{\\mu_i^{(t-1)}}$. This linearizes the model around the current estimates.\n    -   The IRLS weights: $w_i^{(t-1)} = \\left( \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mu_i}{\\partial \\eta_i}\\right)^2 V(Y_i)^{-1} \\right)_{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(t-1)}} = \\dfrac{(\\mu_i^{(t-1)})^2}{\\mu_i^{(t-1)} + \\alpha (\\mu_i^{(t-1)})^2} = \\dfrac{\\mu_i^{(t-1)}}{1 + \\alpha \\mu_i^{(t-1)}}$. These weights are the inverse of the variance of the pseudo-response.\n\n3.  **Update**: A new estimate $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(t)}$ is obtained by solving the WLS normal equations. Let $\\boldsymbol{X}$ be the $n \\times p$ design matrix, $\\boldsymbol{z}^{(t-1)}$ be the vector of pseudo-responses, and $\\boldsymbol{W}^{(t-1)}$ be the diagonal matrix of weights. The update is:\n    $$ \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(t)} = \\left(\\boldsymbol{X}^\\top \\boldsymbol{W}^{(t-1)} \\boldsymbol{X}\\right)^{-1} \\boldsymbol{X}^\\top \\boldsymbol{W}^{(t-1)} \\boldsymbol{z}^{(t-1)} $$\n\n4.  **Convergence**: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until the change in $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ between successive iterations is below a specified tolerance, i.e., $||\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(t)} - \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(t-1)}||_2 < \\epsilon$. The converged vector is the MLE, $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$.\n\nOnce the MLE $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ is obtained, we perform statistical inference on a specific linear combination of the coefficients, defined by a contrast vector $\\boldsymbol{c}$. In this problem, the contrast is $\\boldsymbol{c} = [0, 1, 0]^\\top$, which isolates the coefficient for the treatment effect. The estimated effect size is $\\hat{\\theta} = \\boldsymbol{c}^\\top \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$.\n\nTo test the null hypothesis $H_0: \\boldsymbol{c}^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\beta} = 0$, we use a Wald test. The Wald statistic requires the standard error of $\\hat{\\theta}$, which is derived from the covariance matrix of $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$. The estimated covariance matrix is the inverse of the Fisher information matrix, evaluated at the MLE:\n$$ \\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}) = \\left(\\boldsymbol{X}^\\top \\hat{\\boldsymbol{W}} \\boldsymbol{X}\\right)^{-1} $$\nwhere $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{W}}$ is the weight matrix computed using the final converged mean values $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}$.\n\nThe standard error of the contrast is then:\n$$ \\widehat{\\mathrm{se}}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\sqrt{\\boldsymbol{c}^\\top \\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}})\\, \\boldsymbol{c}} $$\n\nThe Wald statistic $Z$ is computed as the ratio of the estimate to its standard error:\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\hat{\\theta}}{\\widehat{\\mathrm{se}}(\\hat{\\theta})} $$\n\nUnder the null hypothesis, $Z$ follows a standard normal distribution, $\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. The two-sided p-value is calculated as $p = 2 \\cdot P(N > |Z|)$, where $N \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.\n\nFinally, an indicator for the direction of the effect is generated: $\\mathrm{up}$ is true if $\\hat{\\theta} > 0$, indicating upregulation, and false otherwise.
