Sequencing generates counts that are proportional to the relative abundances of transcripts in the input RNA pool; when a fixed number of reads is obtained from each sample, the observed counts are compositional, i.e., they estimate underlying relative abundances that sum to $1$.\n2. Under total count normalization (also called counts per million (CPM) scaling), each sample is scaled by its total read count; if the total read counts are equal, this normalization leaves counts unchanged and comparisons reduce to comparing relative abundances.\n3. A geneâ€™s fold-change between conditions is defined as the ratio of its normalized abundance in condition $\\mathrm{B}$ to its normalized abundance in condition $\\mathrm{A}$.\n\nConsider a transcriptome with two disjoint groups of genes: a subset $\\mathrm{H}$ of highly expressed genes and its complement $\\mathrm{L}$. In condition $\\mathrm{A}$, the total relative abundance carried by $\\mathrm{H}$ is $f \\in (0,1)$, and the total relative abundance carried by $\\mathrm{L}$ is $1 - f$. In condition $\\mathrm{B}$, every gene in $\\mathrm{H}$ is truly upregulated by a multiplicative factor $r > 0$, and every gene in $\\mathrm{L}$ is truly unchanged.

Let us denote the total molecular abundance in the sample for condition $\\mathrm{A}$ as $C_{T,A}$. The abundance of any gene $g$ is $C_{g,A} = \\alpha_{g,A} C_{T,A}$.\n\nIn condition $\\mathrm{B}$, the true abundance of each gene $h \\in \\mathrm{H}$ is multiplied by $r$, and the true abundance of each gene $l \\in \\mathrm{L}$ is unchanged. The new un-normalized abundance for a gene $g$ in condition $\\mathrm{B}$, denoted $C'_{g,B}$, is:\n$$ C'_{h,B} = r \\cdot C_{h,A} \\quad \\text{for } h \\in \\mathrm{H} $$\n$$ C'_{l,B} = C_{l,A} \\quad \\text{for } l \\in \\mathrm{L} $$\n\nThe new total molecular abundance in condition $\\mathrm{B}$, $C'_{T,B}$, is the sum over all genes:\n$$ C'_{T,B} = \\sum_{h \\in \\mathrm{H}} C'_{h,B} + \\sum_{l \\in \\mathrm{L}} C'_{l,B} = \\sum_{h \\in \\mathrm{H}} (r \\cdot C_{h,A}) + \\sum_{l \\in \\mathrm{L}} C_{l,A} $$\nFactoring out $r$ and expressing the sums in terms of relative abundances in condition $\\mathrm{A}$:\n$$ C'_{T,B} = r \\left( \\sum_{h \\in \\mathrm{H}} C_{h,A} \\right) + \\sum_{l \\in \\mathrm{L}} C_{l,A} $$\nWe know that $\\sum_{h \\in \\mathrm{H}} C_{h,A} = C_{T,A} \\sum_{h \\in \\mathrm{H}} \\alpha_{h,A} = C_{T,A} \\cdot f$.\nAnd $\\sum_{l \\in \\mathrm{L}} C_{l,A} = C_{T,A} \\sum_{l \\in \\mathrm{L}} \\alpha_{l,A} = C_{T,A} \\cdot (1-f)$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $C'_{T,B}$:\n$$ C'_{T,B} = r(C_{T,A} \\cdot f) + C_{T,A} \\cdot (1-f) = C_{T,A} (rf + 1 - f) $$\n\nThe observed relative abundance of any gene $g$ in condition $\\mathrm{B}$, $\\alpha_{g,B}$, is its true new abundance divided by the new total abundance, to satisfy the compositional constraint:\n$$ \\alpha_{g,B} = \\frac{C'_{g,B}}{C'_{T,B}} $$\n\nWe are interested in a gene $g \\in \\mathrm{L}$. For such a gene, $C'_{g,B} = C_{g,A}$. We also know $C_{g,A} = \\alpha_{g,A} \\cdot C_{T,A}$.

Since total library sizes are equal, this corresponds to the ratio of the relative abundances. The apparent fold-change, $FC_g$, for any gene $g \\in \\mathrm{L}$ (assuming $\\alpha_{g,A} \\neq 0$) is:\n$$ FC_g = \\frac{\\alpha_{g,B}}{\\alpha_{g,A}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\alpha_{g,A}}{rf + 1 - f}}{\\alpha_{g,A}} $$\n$$ FC_g = \\frac{1}{rf + 1 - f} $$\nThis expression depends only on $f$ and $r$, as required.\n\n**Verification with Toy Example**\n\nNow, we verify this general expression using the provided toy example.\n- Given: $f=0.6$, $r=3$.\n- From the derived formula, the expected apparent fold-change for a gene in $\\mathrm{L}$ is:\n$$ FC_g = \\frac{1}{(3)(0.6) + 1 - 0.6} = \\frac{1}{1.8 + 0.4} = \\frac{1}{2.2} = \\frac{10}{22} = \\frac{5}{11} $$\n\nNext, we compute this from first principles using the toy data.\n- In condition $\\mathrm{A}$, the total read count is $N = 10^6$.\n- The total relative abundance of the $2$ genes in $\\mathrm{L}$ is $1-f = 0.4$. As they share this equally, the relative abundance of a single gene $g \\in \\mathrm{L}$ is $\\alpha_{g,A} = \\frac{0.4}{2} = 0.2$.\n- The read count for this gene in condition $\\mathrm{A}$ is $C_{g,A} = \\alpha_{g,A} \\cdot N = 0.2 \\cdot 10^6 = 200,000$.\n- The total read count for the set $\\mathrm{H}$ in condition $\\mathrm{A}$ is $f \\cdot N = 0.6 \\cdot 10^6 = 600,000$.\n\n- In condition $\\mathrm{B}$, the true abundances of genes in $\\mathrm{H}$ are multiplied by $r=3$, while those in $\\mathrm{L}$ are unchanged. The new un-normalized total count is:\n$$ C'_{T,B} = (\\text{counts for H}) \\times r + (\\text{counts for L}) \\times 1 = (600,000 \\times 3) + (400,000 \\times 1) = 1,800,000 + 400,000 = 2,200,000 $$\n- The un-normalized count of our gene $g \\in \\mathrm{L}$ remains $200,000$.\n- The new relative abundance of gene $g$ in condition $\\mathrm{B}$ is:\n$$ \\alpha_{g,B} = \\frac{\\text{un-normalized count of g}}{\\text{new total un-normalized count}} = \\frac{200,000}{2,200,000} = \\frac{2}{22} = \\frac{1}{11} $$\n\n- The apparent fold-change is the ratio of relative abundances:\n$$ FC_g = \\frac{\\alpha_{g,B}}{\\alpha_{g,A}} = \\frac{1/11}{0.2} = \\frac{1/11}{1/5} = \\frac{5}{11} $$\nThis result matches the one predicted by the derived formula.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, the calculation of size factors for a given count matrix $N$. Second, a proof from first principles concerning the effect of uniform scaling on these size factors.\n\nLet the count matrix be denoted by $N$, where $N_{ij}$ is the count for gene $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ and sample $j \\in \\{A, B, C\\}$.

For any gene $i$ and sample $j$, $N_{ij} = 2^{i-1} N_{1j}$. This structural property simplifies the relationship between the geometric means:\n$$ g_i = (\\prod_{j \\in \\{A,B,C\\}} N_{ij})^{1/3} = (\\prod_{j} 2^{i-1} N_{1j})^{1/3} = ((2^{i-1})^3 \\prod_{j} N_{1j})^{1/3} = 2^{i-1} (\\prod_{j} N_{1j})^{1/3} = 2^{i-1} g_1 $$\nThus, $g_2 = 2g_1$, $g_3 = 4g_1$, and $g_4 = 8g_1$.\n\n**Step 1.2: For each sample, compute the ratios of observed counts to the geometric means.**\nFor each sample $j$, we create a set of ratios $\\{r_{ij} = N_{ij} / g_i\\}$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.

Let the new matrix be $N' = k N$, with entries $N'_{ij} = k N_{ij}$. Let the number of genes be $L$ and the number of samples be $M$.\n\n**Step 2.1: Compute the new gene-wise geometric means, $g'_i$.**\nThe geometric mean for gene $i$ using the scaled matrix $N'$ is:\n$$ g'_i = \\left( \\prod_{j=1}^{M} N'_{ij} \\right)^{1/M} $$\nSubstituting $N'_{ij} = k N_{ij}$:\n$$ g'_i = \\left( \\prod_{j=1}^{M} (k N_{ij}) \\right)^{1/M} = \\left( k^M \\prod_{j=1}^{M} N_{ij} \\right)^{1/M} $$\n$$ g'_i = (k^M)^{1/M} \\left( \\prod_{j=1}^{M} N_{ij} \\right)^{1/M} = k \\cdot g_i $$\nThe new geometric mean for each gene is simply the original geometric mean scaled by the same factor $k$.\n\n**Step 2.2: Compute the new ratios, $r'_{ij}$.**\nThe ratio for gene $i$ and sample $j$ using the scaled data is:\n$$ r'_{ij} = \\frac{N'_{ij}}{g'_i} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $N'_{ij}$ and $g'_i$ from the previous step:\n$$ r'_{ij} = \\frac{k N_{ij}}{k g_i} = \\frac{N_{ij}}{g_i} = r_{ij} $$\nThe scaling factor $k$ cancels completely. The set of ratios for each sample is therefore identical for the scaled matrix $N'$ and the original matrix $N$.\n\n**Step 2.3: Compute the new size factors, $s'_j$.**\nThe size factor $s'_j$ is the median of the set of new ratios $\\{r'_{ij}\\}$ for a given sample $j$:\n$$ s'_j = \\text{median}(\\{r'_{i j}\\}_{i=1}^L) $$\nSince $r'_{ij} = r_{ij}$ for all genes $i$, the set of ratios is unchanged. Therefore, its median must also be unchanged.\n$$ s'_j = \\text{median}(\\{r_{i j}\\}_{i=1}^L) = s_j $$\nThis proves that the size factors computed from the scaled matrix $N'$ are identical to those computed from the original matrix $N$. A uniform rescaling of all counts has no effect on the DESeq2 size factors. This property is fundamental to the method, as it ensures that normalization corrects for library size differences, not for a global change in measurement units.\n\nThe size factor vector for $(S_A, S_B, S_C)$ is therefore common for both matrices $N$ and $N'$.

We will now calculate the PPS for each pathway using the provided data.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the PPS for Pathway A (Apoptosis Regulation Pathway)**\nThe parameters for Pathway A are:\n- Number of genes, $n_A = 36$\n- Average LFC, $\\mu_{\\text{LFC}, A} = -0.50$\n\nSubstituting these values into the PPS formula:\n$$PPS_A = \\frac{-0.50 \\times \\sqrt{36}}{2.0}$$\n$$PPS_A = \\frac{-0.50 \\times 6}{2.0}$$\n$$PPS_A = \\frac{-3.0}{2.0}$$\n$$PPS_A = -1.5$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the PPS for Pathway B (Wnt Signaling Pathway)**\nThe parameters for Pathway B are:\n- Number of genes, $n_B = 100$\n- Average LFC, $\\mu_{\\text{LFC}, B} = +0.35$\n\nSubstituting these values into the PPS formula:\n$$PPS_B = \\frac{+0.35 \\times \\sqrt{100}}{2.0}$$\n$$PPS_B = \\frac{+0.35 \\times 10}{2.0}$$\n$$PPS_B = \\frac{3.5}{2.0}$$\n$$PPS_B = 1.75$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the PPS for Pathway C (ABC Transporter Pathway)**\nThe parameters for Pathway C are:\n- Number of genes, $n_C = 16$\n- Average LFC, $\\mu_{\\text{LFC}, C} = +0.80$\n\nSubstituting these values into the PPS formula:\n$$PPS_C = \\frac{+0.80 \\times \\sqrt{16}}{2.0}$$\n$$PPS_C = \\frac{+0.80 \\times 4}{2.0}$$\n$$PPS_C = \\frac{3.2}{2.0}$$\n$$PPS_C = 1.6$$\n\n**Step 4: Compare the PPS values and identify the pathways**\nThe calculated PPS values for the three pathways are:\n- $PPS_A = -1.5$\n- $PPS_B = 1.75$\n- $PPS_C = 1.6$\n\nAccording to the problem description:\n- The synthetic lethal pathway is the one with the most negative PPS. Comparing the scores, $PPS_A = -1.5$ is the only negative score and therefore the most negative. Thus, Pathway A is the synthetic lethal partner pathway.\n- The resistance-conferring pathway is the one with the most positive PPS. Comparing the positive scores, $1.75 > 1.6$. Therefore, $PPS_B$ is the most positive score. Thus, Pathway B is the resistance-conferring pathway.\n\nIt is important to note that while Pathway C has a larger average LFC ($\\mu_{\\text{LFC}, C} = 0.80$) than Pathway B ($\\mu_{\\text{LFC}, B} = 0.35$), the effect in Pathway B is distributed across a much larger set of genes ($n_B = 100$), making its overall perturbation more statistically significant as captured by the PPS.\n\n**Step 5: Formulate the final answer**\nThe synthetic lethal pathway is A.\nThe resistance pathway is B.\nThe final answer is a two-letter string with the synthetic lethal pathway first and the resistance pathway second. Therefore, the code is AB.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "1489253"}]}
