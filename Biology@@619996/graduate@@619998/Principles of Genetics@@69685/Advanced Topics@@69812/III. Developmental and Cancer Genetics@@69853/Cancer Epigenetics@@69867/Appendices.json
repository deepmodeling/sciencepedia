I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Solution of the Governing Equation**\n\nThe rate of change of the fraction of acetylated sites, $\\frac{dA}{dt}$, is the difference between the rate of formation of acetylated sites and the rate of their removal.\n\nThe rate of formation (acetylation) is proportional to the fraction of available unacetylated sites, $1 - A(t)$, with a rate constant $k_a$.\nRate of formation = $k_a(1 - A(t))$.\n\nThe rate of removal (deacetylation) is proportional to the fraction of acetylated sites, $A(t)$, with a rate constant $k_d$.\nRate of removal = $k_d A(t)$.\n\nCombining these gives the ordinary differential equation for $A(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = k_a(1 - A(t)) - k_d A(t)\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged into the standard form for a linear first-order ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = k_a - k_a A(t) - k_d A(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} + (k_a + k_d)A(t) = k_a\n$$\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear ODE of the form $y' + P(t)y = Q(t)$, where $P(t) = k_a + k_d$ and $Q(t) = k_a$. The solution can be found using an integrating factor, $I(t) = \\exp\\left(\\int (k_a + k_d) dt\\right) = \\exp((k_a + k_d)t)$.\n\nMultiplying the ODE by the integrating factor yields:\n$$\n\\exp((k_a + k_d)t)\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} + (k_a + k_d)\\exp((k_a + k_d)t)A(t) = k_a \\exp((k_a + k_d)t)\n$$\nThe left side is the derivative of the product $A(t)I(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left[ A(t)\\exp((k_a + k_d)t) \\right] = k_a \\exp((k_a + k_d)t)\n$$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $t$:\n$$\nA(t)\\exp((k_a + k_d)t) = \\int k_a \\exp((k_a + k_d)t) dt = \\frac{k_a}{k_a + k_d}\\exp((k_a + k_d)t) + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. Solving for $A(t)$:\n$$\nA(t) = \\frac{k_a}{k_a + k_d} + C \\exp(-(k_a + k_d)t)\n$$\nTo find $C$, we apply the initial condition $A(0) = A_0$:\n$$\nA_0 = \\frac{k_a}{k_a + k_d} + C \\exp(0) = \\frac{k_a}{k_a + k_d} + C\n$$\n$$\nC = A_0 - \\frac{k_a}{k_a + k_d}\n$$\nSubstituting $C$ back into the general solution gives the closed-form solution for $A(t)$:\n$$\nA(t) = \\frac{k_a}{k_a + k_d} + \\left(A_0 - \\frac{k_a}{k_a + k_d}\\right)\\exp(-(k_a + k_d)t)\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Half-Life Calculation under Inhibition**\n\nFor $t \\ge 0$, the experimental conditions change. The HAT activity is blocked, so the acetylation rate constant becomes $0$. The HDAC activity is inhibited, so the deacetylation rate constant becomes $\\alpha k_d$. We apply these new rate constants, $k_a' = 0$ and $k_d' = \\alpha k_d$, to the governing differential equation.\n\nThe new ODE for $t \\ge 0$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -(\\alpha k_d) A(t)\n$$\nThis is a standard first-order decay equation. The initial condition for this process is the fraction of acetylated sites at $t=0$, which we denote as $A(0)$. The problem statement is slightly ambiguous as it uses $A_0$ for the general solution but implies the experiment starts at $t=0$. We take $A(0)$ as the initial state. The solution is of the form:\n$$\nA(t) = A(0) \\exp(-\\alpha k_d t)\n$$\nThis can also be obtained by substituting $k_a \\to 0$ and $k_d \\to \\alpha k_d$ into the general solution derived in Part 1. The steady-state term $\\frac{k_a}{k_a+k_d}$ becomes $0$, and the exponential term becomes $\\exp(-\\alpha k_d t)$, yielding the same result.\n\nThe half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is defined as the time at which $A(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2}A(0)$. We set this condition in the solution:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}A(0) = A(0) \\exp(-\\alpha k_d t_{1/2})\n$$\nAssuming $A(0) \\neq 0$, we can divide by $A(0)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-\\alpha k_d t_{1/2})\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\alpha k_d t_{1/2}\n$$\nUsing the property $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$:\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -\\alpha k_d t_{1/2}\n$$\nSolving for $t_{1/2}$:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\alpha k_d}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $k_d = 0.25 \\, \\text{hour}^{-1}$ and $\\alpha = 0.20$.\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{(0.20)(0.25 \\, \\text{hour}^{-1})} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.05 \\, \\text{hour}^{-1}}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147...$:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{0.693147...}{0.05} \\, \\text{hours} = 13.86294... \\, \\text{hours}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nt_{1/2} \\approx 13.86 \\, \\text{hours}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{13.86}$$", "id": "2794377"}, {"introduction": "While histone marks are often transient, DNA methylation provides a more stable layer of epigenetic memory, yet it is not immutable.

It requires the application of fundamental principles of reaction kinetics and discrete-time dynamics to model methylation inheritance. We will execute the derivation as follows.\n\nThe problem is structured into three tasks. We address each in sequence.\n\nFirst, we derive the recurrence relation for the passive demethylation-only scenario. Let $m_t$ be the fraction of CpG dyads that are fully methylated at the end of cell cycle $t$. We assume the state of the system is fully described by this single variable. The cycle consists of replication followed by maintenance methylation.\n$1$. During semiconservative DNA replication, a fully methylated dyad gives rise to two hemimethylated daughter dyads. A dyad that is not fully methylated is assumed to replicate into daughter dyads that are also not fully methylated. Consequently, in a large population, the fraction of dyads that are hemimethylated immediately following replication is $m_t$. The remaining fraction, $1 - m_t$, consists of unmethylated dyads which are not substrates for maintenance methylation.\n$2$. The maintenance methylation process, executed by DNMT1, acts upon the hemimethylated dyads. The probability of successful methylation of the nascent strand at a hemimethylated dyad is $1 - \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon \\in [0,1)$ is the per-dyad failure probability. A successful event restores the fully methylated state.\nThe fraction of dyads that become fully methylated by the end of cycle $t+1$, denoted $m_{t+1}$, is therefore the fraction of hemimethylated dyads available after replication, $m_t$, multiplied by the probability of successful maintenance, $1-\\epsilon$.\nThus, the recurrence relation is:\n$$m_{t+1} = (1 - \\epsilon) m_t$$\n\nSecond, we formulate the continuous-time model for the active demethylation-only scenario. In this case, there is no replication. Let $m(t)$ represent the fraction of fully methylated dyads at time $t$. The problem states that its dynamics are governed by first-order mass-action loss. This translates to a rate of change, $\\frac{dm(t)}{dt}$, that is proportional to the current fraction $m(t)$.\nThe governing ordinary differential equation is:\n$$ \\frac{dm(t)}{dt} = -k_{\\text{demeth}} m(t) $$\nwhere $k_{\\text{demeth}}$ is the non-negative rate constant for active demethylation. This is a separable first-order linear differential equation. To find the solution starting from an initial condition $m(0)$ at $t=0$, we integrate:\n$$ \\int_{m(0)}^{m(t)} \\frac{d\\mu}{\\mu} = \\int_{0}^{t} -k_{\\text{demeth}} d\\tau $$\nThis yields:\n$$ \\ln(m(t)) - \\ln(m(0)) = -k_{\\text{demeth}} t $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{m(t)}{m(0)}\\right) = -k_{\\text{demeth}} t $$\nExponentiating both sides gives the solution for $m(t)$:\n$$ m(t) = m(0) \\exp(-k_{\\text{demeth}} t) $$\n\nThird, we derive the expression for an \"equivalent\" active demethylation rate constant $k_{\\text{demeth}}$. This equivalence is defined by the condition that both the passive and active models result in the same multiplicative reduction in methylation fraction over a single cell cycle of duration $T_c$.\nFor the passive demethylation model, the multiplicative reduction factor over one cycle is obtained from the recurrence relation:\n$$ \\frac{m_{t+1}}{m_t} = 1 - \\epsilon $$\nFor the active demethylation model, the multiplicative reduction factor over a time interval of length $T_c$ is found from its solution:\n$$ \\frac{m(T_c)}{m(0)} = \\frac{m(0) \\exp(-k_{\\text{demeth}} T_c)}{m(0)} = \\exp(-k_{\\text{demeth}} T_c) $$\nEquating these two factors establishes the condition for equivalence:\n$$ \\exp(-k_{\\text{demeth}} T_c) = 1 - \\epsilon $$\nTo solve for $k_{\\text{demeth}}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\exp(-k_{\\text{demeth}} T_c)\\right) = \\ln(1 - \\epsilon) $$\n$$ -k_{\\text{demeth}} T_c = \\ln(1 - \\epsilon) $$\nFinally, isolating $k_{\\text{demeth}}$ yields the closed-form analytic expression:\n$$ k_{\\text{demeth}} = -\\frac{\\ln(1 - \\epsilon)}{T_c} $$\nThis expression is dimensionally correct, with units of inverse time. Since $\\epsilon \\in [0, 1)$, it follows that $1 - \\epsilon \\in (0, 1]$, making $\\ln(1 - \\epsilon)$ a non-positive value.

Consider a truly unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) site sequenced to coverage $n=10$ independent reads. The bisulfite conversion efficiency is $e=0.99$, meaning that in any single read an unmethylated cytosine converts to thymine with probability $0.99$ and fails to convert with probability $1-e=0.01$, producing an apparent cytosine indistinguishable from a methylated cytosine.

The experimental setup involves $n=10$ independent sequencing reads. Each read constitutes an independent Bernoulli trial.\n\nLet us define a \"failure\" for a single trial as the event where the bisulfite conversion of an unmethylated cytosine fails, resulting in the read reporting a cytosine (C) instead of a thymine (T). This is the event that leads to a false positive signal. The problem states that the bisulfite conversion efficiency is $e = 0.99$. This is the probability of a successful conversion (unmethylated C to T). Therefore, the probability of a conversion failure in any single read, which we denote as $p$, is:\n$$p = 1 - e = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01$$\n\nLet the random variable $K$ be the number of reads that report an unconverted cytosine (i.e., the number of conversion failures) out of the total $n=10$ reads.
