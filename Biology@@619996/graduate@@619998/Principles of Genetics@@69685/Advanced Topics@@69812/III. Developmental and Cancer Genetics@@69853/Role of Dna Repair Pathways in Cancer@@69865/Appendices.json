The problem specifies that \"fold increase\" is to be interpreted in its standard quantitative sense in experimental biology.\n- The quantity to be determined is the absolute change in the degradation rate, $\\Delta d$, defined as the difference between the BRCA2-loss rate and the baseline rate: $\\Delta d = d_{loss} - d_0$.\n- The final expression for $\\Delta d$ must be in terms of $d_0$ and $\\alpha$.\n\nStep 2: Validation of Problem Statement.\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The role of the BRCA2 protein in maintaining replication fork stability and preventing excessive degradation by nucleases is a well-established principle in molecular biology and genetics. DNA fiber assays are a standard experimental technique to quantify such phenomena. The problem is objective, providing clear definitions and quantitative relationships. It is not metaphorical, contradictory, or incomplete. The crucial aspect is the interpretation of the term \"fold increase\". In quantitative scientific fields, an \"$\\alpha$-fold increase\" or \"$\\alpha$-fold change\" signifies that the new value is a multiple $\\alpha$ of the original value. For example, a $3$-fold increase means the new value is $3$ times the original value. The problem explicitly directs this interpretation by stating it is used \"in its standard quantitative sense\". Thus, the problem is well-posed and has a unique, meaningful solution. There are no flaws according to the specified validation criteria.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed to derive the solution.\n\nThe objective is to find $\\Delta d$. By definition, this is:\n$$\n\\Delta d = d_{loss} - d_0\n$$\nwhere $d_{loss}$ is the degradation rate in the BRCA2-null line and $d_0$ is the baseline rate.\n\nThe relationship between $d_{loss}$ and $d_0$ is given by the \"fold increase $\\alpha$\". As established, this means the new rate, $d_{loss}$, is $\\alpha$ times the original rate, $d_0$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\nd_{loss} = \\alpha \\cdot d_0\n$$\nIt is important to distinguish this from an \"$\\alpha$-fold increase *over* baseline,\" which could ambiguously imply $d_0 + \\alpha d_0$. However, the standard convention for \"an $\\alpha$-fold increase\" is multiplicative, meaning the ratio of the new value to the old value is $\\alpha$.\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $d_{loss}$ into the equation for $\\Delta d$:\n$$\n\\Delta d = (\\alpha \\cdot d_0) - d_0\n$$\nThis expression can be simplified by factoring out the common term $d_0$:\n$$\n\\Delta d = d_0 (\\alpha - 1)\n$$\nThis represents the absolute change in the degradation rate. The term $(\\alpha - 1)$ represents the fractional increase relative to the baseline. For example, if $\\alpha = 3$ (a $3$-fold increase), the absolute change is $\\Delta d = d_0 (3 - 1) = 2d_0$, which is a $200\\%$ increase over the baseline value, consistent with the new value being $300\\%$ of the original.\n\nThe result is a closed-form symbolic expression for $\\Delta d$ in terms of the given parameters $d_0$ and $\\alpha$, as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{d_0 (\\alpha - 1)}\n$$", "id": "2849356"}, {"introduction": "Moving from a controlled cell line to the complexity of a patient's tumor requires more sophisticated analytical tools.

In a tumor biopsy, short-read sequencing of the BRCA2 locus yields $N$ independent reads, of which $X$ support the germline variant.

Assume the following foundational principles and modeling assumptions:\n\n- In normal cells that are heterozygous at germline, the expected variant allele fraction is $1/2$.\n- In tumor cells, the expected fraction of BRCA2 copies carrying the germline variant equals the ratio of the number of tumor copies bearing the germline variant to the total number of tumor copies $C$ at the locus.\n- The observed variant read count $X$ is generated by independent sampling from a Bernoulli process with success probability equal to the mixture of the tumor and normal compartments, weighted by the tumor purity $p$.\n- Biallelic inactivation at BRCA2 arises via loss of heterozygosity (LOH) that removes the wild-type allele such that all tumor copies at the locus carry the germline variant.

We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe task is to compute the posterior probability of biallelic inactivation via loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the $BRCA2$ locus, given the sequencing data. This is a problem of Bayesian inference.

Thus, the number of variant copies is $C$, and $VAF_{tumor, LOH} = \\frac{C}{C} = 1$.

Loss of heterozygosity can arise with or without changes in total copy number. Copy-number-neutral loss of heterozygosity (cnLOH) reflects mitotic recombination or gene conversion that reduces heterozygosity without changing total copy number.

The question asks for an interpretation based on these calculations, which is a solvable, non-ambiguous task.\n3.  **Consistency:** The data are internally consistent. For Tumor $X$, there are $3$ LOH segments accompanying deletions, and the separate count of deletions $> 15$ Mb is also $3$. For Tumor $Y$, there are $9$ LOH segments accompanying deletions, and the count of deletions $> 15$ Mb is also $9$. This internal consistency confirms the data is not contradictory.\n4.  **Realism:** The scenarios describe two classic archetypes of tumors: one with HRD driven by BRCA1 loss and characterized by cnLOH, and another, HR-proficient tumor with chromosomal instability driven by copy-number alterations.

The large number of copy-number-neutral scars of HRD in Tumor $X$ ($15$ cnLOH, $10$ cn-TAI, $14$ cn-LST) are captured by this method, leading to a high score.\n- **Method $\\mathcal{B}$:** This method is blind to allele frequencies and only detects total copy number changes. It therefore misses the predominant copy-number-neutral scars in Tumor $X$. Consequently, it assigns a very low score ($S_{\\mathcal{B}}(X) = 11$) to the truly HR-deficient tumor. Conversely, it assigns a spuriously high score ($S_{\\mathcal{B}}(Y) = 33$) to the HR-proficient Tumor $Y$ because that tumor's genome is unstable due to many copy number alterations (deletions).\n- **Clinical Implications:** A low score of $11$ from Method $\\mathcal{B}$ for Tumor $X$ would likely result in a false-negative classification, meaning the tumor would be deemed HR-proficient.

The reason for the discrepancy is accurately identified as Method $\\mathcal{A}$'s ability to detect copy-number-neutral events, which Method $\\mathcal{B}$ cannot. The clinical consequence—a risk of a false-negative result for Tumor $X$ using Method $\\mathcal{B}$ and underprediction of PARP inhibitor sensitivity—is also correctly stated.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Both Method $\\mathcal{A}$ and Method $\\mathcal{B}$ will assign higher homologous recombination deficiency scores to Tumor $Y$ than to Tumor $X$ because deletions dominate Tumor $Y$; this indicates Tumor $Y$ is more likely to be sensitive to PARP inhibition than Tumor $X$.**\n- **Evaluation:** The premise is false. Our calculation shows that Method $\\mathcal{A}$ assigns a higher score to Tumor $X$ ($S_{\\mathcal{A}}(X) = 50$) than to Tumor $Y$ ($S_{\\mathcal{A}}(Y) = 38$). Furthermore, the conclusion is biologically incorrect; Tumor $X$ is the HR-deficient tumor and is expected to be sensitive to PARP inhibition, not Tumor $Y$.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Both Method $\\mathcal{A}$ and Method $\\mathcal{B}$ will assign similarly high homologous recombination deficiency scores to Tumor $X$, correctly predicting PARP inhibitor sensitivity regardless of platform; copy-number-neutral loss of heterozygosity does not materially influence either score.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement is false on multiple grounds. The scores for Tumor $X$ are not similar ($S_{\\mathcal{A}} = 50$ vs. $S_{\\mathcal{B}} = 11$). Copy-number-neutral events are precisely the reason for the high score from Method $\\mathcal{A}$ and thus materially influence the outcome. Method $\\mathcal{B}$ fails to correctly predict sensitivity.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Method $\\mathcal{A}$ will under-score Tumor $X$ relative to Tumor $Y$ because copy-number-neutral loss of heterozygosity does not contribute to allelic-imbalance-defined metrics; Method $\\mathcal{B}$ will correctly classify Tumor $X$ as homologous recombination deficient and predict PARP inhibitor sensitivity based on its deletion burden.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement is the inverse of reality. Method $\\mathcal{A}$ gives a higher score to Tumor $X$ *because* it detects cnLOH, which is a key form of allelic imbalance. Method $\\mathcal{B}$ gives a low score to Tumor $X$ and would likely misclassify it.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2849319"}]}
