It assumes that the complex machinery of gene transcription and protein translation operates at a steady, saturated rate that is independent of the final protein concentration.\nThe degradation terms, $-\\delta_{K}E_{K}$ and $-\\beta E_{T}$, are modeled as first-order processes. This implies that each protein molecule has a constant probability per unit time of being targeted for degradation, a reasonable approximation for cellular protein turnover mechanisms such as ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.\nThe enzymatic conversion of PIP2 to PIP3 and vice versa is modeled using the law of mass action, with rates like $k_{f}\\,E_{K}\\,[{\\rm PIP2}]$. While enzymatic reactions are more accurately described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics, mass-action kinetics serve as a valid approximation when the substrate concentrations (e.g., $[{\\rm PIP2}]$) are significantly below the Michaelis constant ($K_{M}$) of the respective enzyme. In this limit, the reaction rate is approximately linear with respect to substrate concentration and proportional to enzyme concentration. This simplification is acceptable for constructing a minimal, analytically tractable model.\n\nDerivation of Steady-State $[{\\rm PIP3}]$:\nFirst, we determine the steady-state abundances of the enzymes by setting their time derivatives to zero.

Therefore, the derived formula for $i_{\\mathrm{s}}(t)$, interpreted via its limit, is general.\n\nNow, we compute the ratio $R(t) = i_{\\mathrm{s}}(t) / i_{\\mathrm{g}}(t)$. For the general case $\\lambda_{1} \\neq \\lambda_{2}$:\n$$\nR(t) = \\frac{\\frac{\\lambda_{1} \\lambda_{2}}{\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2}} (\\exp(-\\lambda_{2} t) - \\exp(-\\lambda_{1} t))}{\\lambda_{2} \\exp(-\\lambda_{2} t)} = \\frac{\\lambda_{1}}{\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2}} \\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda_{2} t) - \\exp(-\\lambda_{1} t)}{\\exp(-\\lambda_{2} t)}\n$$\n$$\nR(t) = \\frac{\\lambda_{1}}{\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2}} (1 - \\exp(-(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2})t))\n$$\nWe are asked for the leading-order small-$t$ expression, $R_{\\mathrm{LO}}(t)$, as $t \\to 0^{+}$. We perform a Maclaurin series expansion of $R(t)$ with respect to $t$. We use the expansion $\\exp(-x) = 1 - x + O(x^{2})$ for small $x$. Let $x = (\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2})t$. As $t \\to 0^{+}$, $x \\to 0$.\n$$\n1 - \\exp(-(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2})t) = 1 - \\left(1 - (\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2})t + O(t^{2})\\right) = (\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2})t + O(t^{2})\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $R(t)$:\n$$\nR(t) \\approx \\frac{\\lambda_{1}}{\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2}} [(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2})t] = \\lambda_{1} t\n$$\nThus, the leading-order small-$t$ expression for the ratio is:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{LO}}(t) = \\lambda_{1} t\n$$\nThis result is also consistent for the case $\\lambda_{1} = \\lambda_{2} = \\lambda$. In this instance, $i_{\\mathrm{s}}(t) = \\lambda^{2} t \\exp(-\\lambda t)$ and $i_{\\mathrm{g}}(t) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda t)$. The ratio is exactly:\n$$\nR(t) = \\frac{\\lambda^{2} t \\exp(-\\lambda t)}{\\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda t)} = \\lambda t\n$$\nThis matches our general result $R_{\\mathrm{LO}}(t) = \\lambda_{1} t$ upon setting $\\lambda_{1} = \\lambda$.\n\nThe expression $R_{\\mathrm{LO}}(t) = \\lambda_{1} t$ reveals the fundamental difference in incidence patterns at early ages predicted by the model. The incidence of sporadic cancer rises linearly with age $t$, with a slope given by the rate of the first hit, $\\lambda_1$. In contrast, the incidence of germline cancer is approximately constant at early ages, $i_{\\mathrm{g}}(t) \\approx \\lambda_{2}$. The ratio is therefore linear in age, reflecting the requirement of an additional rare event (the first hit) in the sporadic pathway, the probability of which is proportional to time for small times.\n\nThe final answer is the derived closed-form analytic expression for $R_{\\mathrm{LO}}(t)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\lambda_{1} t}\n$$", "id": "2843565"}]}
