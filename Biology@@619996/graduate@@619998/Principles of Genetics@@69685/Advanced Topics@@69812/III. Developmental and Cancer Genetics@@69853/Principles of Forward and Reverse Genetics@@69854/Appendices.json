Determine gene order.\n    2.  Compute map distances between adjacent genes.\n    3.  Compute a numerical value for interference, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is a standard exercise in linkage analysis and gene mapping, a fundamental topic in genetics. It is based on established Mendelian principles and the chromosomal theory of inheritance. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary data (progeny counts) and clear definitions for the quantities to be calculated (map distance, interference). The instructions are unambiguous, leading to a unique, stable solution.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and objective language, free of speculation or subjective claims.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid. It is a well-formulated, standard problem in quantitative genetics. Proceeding to solution.\n\nThe total number of progeny, $N$, is the sum of all observed classes:\n$$N = 662 + 661 + 98 + 99 + 218 + 219 + 21 + 22 = 2000$$\n\n**1. Determination of Gene Order**\nThe gene order is determined by comparing the parental gamete classes (non-crossovers, NCO) with the double crossover (DCO) gamete classes. Parental classes are the most frequent, and DCO classes are the least frequent.\n\n-   **Parental (NCO) classes**: The genotypes $A B C$ (count $662$) and $a b c$ (count $661$) are the most abundant. They represent the parental, non-recombinant gametes. Total NCO count is $662 + 661 = 1323$.\n-   **Double Crossover (DCO) classes**: The genotypes $A b C$ (count $21$) and $a B c$ (count $22$) are the least abundant. They result from simultaneous crossovers in the two intervals between the three genes. Total DCO count is $21 + 22 = 43$.\n\nTo find the middle gene, we compare a parental haplotype (e.g., $A B C$) with a double-crossover haplotype (e.g., $A b C$). The gene that differs between the two is the middle gene. Comparing $A B C$ and $A b C$, the alleles for loci $A$ and $C$ are unchanged, while the allele for locus $B$ is swapped. Therefore, locus $B$ is in the middle. The correct gene order is $A-B-C$.\n\n**2. Calculation of Map Distances**\nWith the gene order established as $A-B-C$, we can classify the single crossover (SCO) events.\n\n-   **Single Crossovers in Interval 1 ($A-B$)**: These classes show recombination between $A$ and $B$, but not between $B$ and $C$. The genotypes are $A b c$ and $a B C$. The total count for SCO in Interval 1 is $98 + 99 = 197$.\n-   **Single Crossovers in Interval 2 ($B-C$)**: These classes show recombination between $B$ and $C$, but not between $A$ and $B$. The genotypes are $A B c$ and $a b C$. The total count for SCO in Interval 2 is $218 + 219 = 437$.\n\nThe recombination frequency ($RF$) for an interval is the sum of SCOs for that interval and all DCOs, divided by the total number of progeny.\n\n-   **Map distance for Interval 1 ($d_{A-B}$)**:\nThe total number of recombinant progeny for the $A-B$ interval is the sum of SCO-1 and DCO counts.\n$$RF_{A-B} = \\frac{(\\text{SCO-1}) + (\\text{DCO})}{N} = \\frac{197 + 43}{2000} = \\frac{240}{2000} = 0.12$$\nThe map distance is:\n$$d_{A-B} = 100 \\times RF_{A-B} = 100 \\times 0.12 = 12 \\text{ cM}$$\n\n-   **Map distance for Interval 2 ($d_{B-C}$)**:\nThe total number of recombinant progeny for the $B-C$ interval is the sum of SCO-2 and DCO counts.\n$$RF_{B-C} = \\frac{(\\text{SCO-2}) + (\\text{DCO})}{N} = \\frac{437 + 43}{2000} = \\frac{480}{2000} = 0.24$$\nThe map distance is:\n$$d_{B-C} = 100 \\times RF_{B-C} = 100 \\times 0.24 = 24 \\text{ cM}$$\n\n**3. Calculation of Interference**\nInterference ($I$) measures the degree to which a crossover event in one interval affects the probability of a crossover event in an adjacent interval. It is calculated as $I = 1 - C$, where $C$ is the coefficient of coincidence.\n\n-   **Coefficient of Coincidence ($C$)**:\n$C$ is the ratio of the observed frequency of double crossovers to the expected frequency of double crossovers.\n$$C = \\frac{\\text{Observed DCO frequency}}{\\text{Expected DCO frequency}}$$\n\n-   **Observed DCO frequency ($f_{DCO, obs}$)**:\nThis is the observed number of DCO progeny divided by the total number of progeny.\n$$f_{DCO, obs} = \\frac{43}{2000} = 0.0215$$\n\n-   **Expected DCO frequency ($f_{DCO, exp}$)**:\nThis is calculated under the assumption of independence, meaning the probability of a double crossover is the product of the individual recombination frequencies of the two intervals.\n$$f_{DCO, exp} = RF_{A-B} \\times RF_{B-C} = 0.12 \\times 0.24 = 0.0288$$\n\n-   **Calculate $C$ and $I$**:\nNow, we can compute the coefficient of coincidence.\n$$C = \\frac{f_{DCO, obs}}{f_{DCO, exp}} = \\frac{0.0215}{0.0288} \\approx 0.7465277...$$\nFinally, the interference is calculated.\n$$I = 1 - C = 1 - \\frac{0.0215}{0.0288} = 1 - 0.7465277... = 0.2534722...$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be reported as a pure decimal number rounded to four significant figures.\n$$I \\approx 0.2535$$\nThe positive value of interference indicates that a crossover in one interval suppresses the formation of a crossover in the adjacent interval, which is a common biological phenomenon.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0.2535} $$", "id": "2840684"}, {"introduction": "Biological processes are governed by networks of interacting genes, not by genes acting in isolation.

To confirm and quantify genetic interactions by reverse genetics, a precise double mutant $ab$ was constructed. The measured phenotype is a dimensionless, normalized relative growth yield $P$ (per culture) that equals $1$ for the wild type baseline by definition. The following replicate-averaged values were obtained under identical assay conditions: wild type $P_{\\mathrm{WT}} = 1.00$, single mutant $a$ has $P_{a} = 0.82$, single mutant $b$ has $P_{b} = 0.68$, and double mutant $ab$ has $P_{ab}^{\\mathrm{obs}} = 0.51$.\n\nStarting from first principles and core definitions appropriate to quantitative genetic interaction analysis:\n- In an additive model on the observed scale, assume that single-mutant deviations from the wild type baseline combine linearly.\n- In a multiplicative model on the observed scale, assume that single-mutant proportional effects relative to the wild type baseline combine independently.\n\nUsing only these definitions as your starting point, derive the null expected double-mutant phenotype under each model and then define and compute the epistasis coefficient $\\epsilon$ for each model as the deviation of the observed double-mutant phenotype from its corresponding null expectation.

No physical units are required because $P$ is dimensionless by construction.", "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation before any attempt at a solution is made.\n\nFirst, the givens are extracted verbatim from the problem statement:\n- A quantitative phenotype, the normalized relative growth yield $P$.\n- Wild type phenotype: $P_{\\mathrm{WT}} = 1.00$.\n- Single mutant $a$ phenotype: $P_{a} = 0.82$.\n- Single mutant $b$ phenotype: $P_{b} = 0.68$.\n- Observed double mutant $ab$ phenotype: $P_{ab}^{\\mathrm{obs}} = 0.51$.\n- Definition for an additive null model: single-mutant deviations from the wild type baseline combine linearly.\n- Definition for a multiplicative null model: single-mutant proportional effects relative to the wild type baseline combine independently.\n- The task is to derive the null expected double-mutant phenotype under each model, and then compute the epistasis coefficient $\\epsilon$ for both models.\n\nSecond, these givens are validated. The problem is scientifically grounded, employing standard concepts and terminology from quantitative genetics such as genetic interaction, epistasis, and null models of non-interaction (additive and multiplicative). It is well-posed, providing all necessary numerical data and definitions to arrive at a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is a standard, formalizable exercise in calculating epistasis and does not violate any principles of scientific or mathematical logic. It is not incomplete, contradictory, or trivial.\n\nThe verdict is that the problem is valid. A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe concept of epistasis, or genetic interaction, quantifies the extent to which the phenotype of a double mutant deviates from the phenotype expected under a null model of non-interaction. The epistasis coefficient, $\\epsilon$, is defined as this deviation. We will adopt the convention that $\\epsilon$ is the observed phenotype minus the expected phenotype:\n$$\n\\epsilon = P_{ab}^{\\mathrm{obs}} - P_{ab}^{\\mathrm{exp}}\n$$\nUnder this convention, $\\epsilon > 0$ signifies a positive or synergistic interaction, meaning the double mutant is less fit than expected. For deleterious mutations as presented here, this is often called synergistic epistasis. Conversely, $\\epsilon  0$ signifies a negative or antagonistic interaction, meaning the double mutant is more fit than expected. This is often called antagonistic epistasis. We will calculate $\\epsilon$ for both the additive and multiplicative models.\n\nFirst, we analyze the additive model. The model posits that the effects of individual mutations, defined as their deviations from the wild type, are summed. The deviation for mutant $a$ is $\\Delta_a = P_a - P_{\\mathrm{WT}}$, and for mutant $b$ is $\\Delta_b = P_b - P_{\\mathrm{WT}}$. The expected phenotype for the double mutant, $P_{ab}^{\\mathrm{add}}$, is the wild-type phenotype plus the sum of these individual deviations:\n$$\nP_{ab}^{\\mathrm{add}} = P_{\\mathrm{WT}} + \\Delta_a + \\Delta_b = P_{\\mathrm{WT}} + (P_a - P_{\\mathrm{WT}}) + (P_b - P_{\\mathrm{WT}})\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nP_{ab}^{\\mathrm{add}} = P_a + P_b - P_{\\mathrm{WT}}\n$$\nUsing the provided values:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{WT}} = 1.00, \\quad P_a = 0.82, \\quad P_b = 0.68\n$$\nWe calculate the expected additive phenotype:\n$$\nP_{ab}^{\\mathrm{add}} = 0.82 + 0.68 - 1.00 = 1.50 - 1.00 = 0.50\n$$\nThe epistasis coefficient for the additive model, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{add}}$, is then:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{add}} = P_{ab}^{\\mathrm{obs}} - P_{ab}^{\\mathrm{add}} = 0.51 - 0.50 = 0.01\n$$\n\nSecond, we analyze the multiplicative model. This model assumes that the proportional fitness effects of the individual mutations combine multiplicatively. The proportional effect of mutant $a$ relative to wild type is the ratio $P_a / P_{\\mathrm{WT}}$, and for mutant $b$ it is $P_b / P_{\\mathrm{WT}}$. The expected phenotype for the double mutant, $P_{ab}^{\\mathrm{mult}}$, is the wild-type phenotype multiplied by these two independent proportional effects:\n$$\nP_{ab}^{\\mathrm{mult}} = P_{\\mathrm{WT}} \\times \\left(\\frac{P_a}{P_{\\mathrm{WT}}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{P_b}{P_{\\mathrm{WT}}}\\right)\n$$\nSince $P_{\\mathrm{WT}} = 1.00$ by definition, this simplifies to:\n$$\nP_{ab}^{\\mathrm{mult}} = 1.00 \\times \\left(\\frac{P_a}{1.00}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{P_b}{1.00}\\right) = P_a \\times P_b\n$$\nUsing the provided values:\n$$\nP_{ab}^{\\mathrm{mult}} = 0.82 \\times 0.68 = 0.5576\n$$\nThe epistasis coefficient for the multiplicative model, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mult}}$, is then:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mult}} = P_{ab}^{\\mathrm{obs}} - P_{ab}^{\\mathrm{mult}} = 0.51 - 0.5576 = -0.0476\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the final values to be rounded to four significant figures.\nFor the additive model, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{add}} = 0.01$. To four significant figures, this is $0.01000$.\nFor the multiplicative model, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mult}} = -0.0476$. This value already has four significant figures.\n\nThe results indicate a small positive (synergistic) interaction in the additive model, as the observed double mutant fitness is slightly lower than expected. In contrast, the results indicate a negative (antagonistic) interaction in the multiplicative model, as the observed double mutant fitness is higher than expected. The choice of null model is therefore critical for interpreting the sign and magnitude of genetic interactions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.01000  -0.0476 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2840546"}, {"introduction": "Reverse genetics has been revolutionized by pooled CRISPR screens, which allow for the systematic functional interrogation of thousands of genes simultaneously.

We equate the sample variance of the $\\widehat{\\ell_i}$, denoted $\\hat{V}_{\\ell}$, to the average theoretical variance: $\\hat{V}_{\\ell} = \\hat{\\tau}^2 + \\bar{s^2}$, where $\\bar{s^2} = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^m s_i^2$.\nThe average of the $\\widehat{\\ell_i}$ is $\\bar{\\ell} \\approx 0.1508$. The sample variance is $\\hat{V}_{\\ell} = \\frac{1}{m-1} \\sum (\\widehat{\\ell_i} - \\bar{\\ell})^2 \\approx 0.5014$. The mean of the sampling variances is $\\bar{s^2} \\approx 0.0848$.\nThe estimate for the prior variance is $\\hat{\\tau}^2 = \\max(0, \\hat{V}_{\\ell} - \\bar{s^2}) = \\max(0, 0.5014-0.0848) = 0.4166$.\nThe shrunken log-fold changes $\\widehat{\\ell}_{i, \\text{shrunk}} = \\frac{\\hat{\\tau}^2}{s_i^2+\\hat{\\tau}^2}\\widehat{\\ell_i}$ are:\n-   $\\widehat{\\ell}_{1,\\text{shrunk}} \\approx 0.9319$\n-   $\\widehat{\\ell}_{2,\\text{shrunk}} \\approx -0.1248$\n-   $\\widehat{\\ell}_{3,\\text{shrunk}} \\approx -0.9163$\n-   $\\widehat{\\ell}_{4,\\text{shrunk}} \\approx 0.1098$\n-   $\\widehat{\\ell}_{5,\\text{shrunk}} \\approx -0.1249$\n-   $\\widehat{\\ell}_{6,\\text{shrunk}} \\approx 0.9482$\n-   $\\widehat{\\ell}_{7,\\text{shrunk}} \\approx 0.1436$\n-   $\\widehat{\\ell}_{8,\\text{shrunk}} \\approx -0.0519$\n\n4. Compute two-sided p-values using the Wald statistic $z_i$.\nFor hypothesis testing of $H_0: \\theta_i=0$, we use the unshrunken estimates. The Wald statistic is $z_i = \\widehat{\\ell_i}/s_i$, which under $H_0$ follows a standard normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ for large samples. The two-sided p-value is $p_i = 2P(Z  |z_i|)$ for $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.\nThe statistics and p-values are:\n-   $z_1 \\approx 8.097$, $p_1 \\approx 5.6 \\times 10^{-16}$\n-   $z_2 \\approx -0.832$, $p_2 \\approx 0.4056$\n-   $z_3 \\approx -4.139$, $p_3 \\approx 3.49 \\times 10^{-5}$\n-   $z_4 \\approx 0.514$, $p_4 \\approx 0.6071$\n-   $z_5 \\approx -1.246$, $p_5 \\approx 0.2128$\n-   $z_6 \\approx 3.492$, $p_6 \\approx 4.80 \\times 10^{-4}$\n-   $z_7 \\approx 0.447$, $p_7 \\approx 0.6549$\n-   $z_8 \\approx -0.312$, $p_8 \\approx 0.7552$\n\n5. Apply the Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) procedure.\nWe control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) at $q=0.05$ across the $m=8$ tests. First, we sort the p-values in ascending order: $p_{(1)} \\le p_{(2)} \\le \\dots \\le p_{(m)}$.\n-   $p_{(1)} = 5.6 \\times 10^{-16}$ (Gene 1)\n-   $p_{(2)} = 3.49 \\times 10^{-5}$ (Gene 3)\n-   $p_{(3)} = 4.80 \\times 10^{-4}$ (Gene 6)\n-   $p_{(4)} = 0.2128$ (Gene 5)\n-   $p_{(5)} = 0.4056$ (Gene 2)\n-   $p_{(6)} = 0.6071$ (Gene 4)\n-   $p_{(7)} = 0.6549$ (Gene 7)\n-   $p_{(8)} = 0.7552$ (Gene 8)\n\nNext, we find the largest integer $k$ such that $p_{(k)} \\le \\frac{k}{m}q$. With $m=8$ and $q=0.05$, the BH threshold is $\\frac{k}{8}(0.05)$.\n-   For $k=1$: $p_{(1)} = 5.6 \\times 10^{-16} \\le \\frac{1}{8}(0.05) = 0.00625$. Condition is met.\n-   For $k=2$: $p_{(2)} = 3.49 \\times 10^{-5} \\le \\frac{2}{8}(0.05) = 0.0125$. Condition is met.\n-   For $k=3$: $p_{(3)} = 4.80 \\times 10^{-4} \\le \\frac{3}{8}(0.05) = 0.01875$. Condition is met.\n-   For $k=4$: $p_{(4)} = 0.2128 \\le \\frac{4}{8}(0.05) = 0.025$. Condition is not met.\n\nThe largest value of $k$ that satisfies the condition is $k=3$. According to the BH procedure, we reject the null hypotheses for the first $k=3$ genes in the sorted list. These correspond to genes $1$, $3$, and $6$. The total number of genes called significant is $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "2840676"}]}
