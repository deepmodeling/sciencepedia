Consider a single mitosis of a cell with $n$ distinct chromosomes entering metaphase.

No numerical evaluation or rounding is required. No units are to be included.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound. It presents a standard, well-posed problem in probability theory as applied to a simplified model of chromosomal instability in genetics. We shall proceed with a rigorous derivation from the specified first principles.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the expectation $\\mathbb{E}[X]$ and variance $\\mathrm{Var}(X)$ for the total number of aneuploid segregation events, $X$, in a single mitosis involving $n$ distinct chromosomes. The derivation must rely only on the definitions of a Bernoulli trial, linearity of expectation, and the variance of a sum of independent random variables.\n\nLet us define a set of indicator random variables, $\\{X_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$, for each of the $n$ chromosomes. For the $i$-th chromosome, where $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$, let $X_i$ be defined as:\n$$\nX_i = \n\\begin{cases}\n    1 & \\text{if an aneuploid segregation event occurs for chromosome } i \\\\\n    0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nAccording to the problem statement, the probability of an aneuploid event for any given chromosome is $p$. Therefore, the probability distribution for each $X_i$ is:\n$$\nP(X_i = 1) = p\n$$\n$$\nP(X_i = 0) = 1 - p\n$$\nThis structure defines each $X_i$ as a Bernoulli random variable with parameter $p$. A single observation of $X_i$ is a Bernoulli trial.\n\nThe total number of aneuploid events, $X$, is the sum of these individual events across all $n$ chromosomes. Thus, we can express $X$ as the sum of these indicator variables:\n$$\nX = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\n$$\n\nFirst, we derive the expectation $\\mathbb{E}[X]$. We begin by finding the expectation of a single indicator variable, $\\mathbb{E}[X_i]$. By the definition of expected value for a discrete random variable:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_i] = \\sum_{k} k \\cdot P(X_i=k) = (1 \\cdot P(X_i=1)) + (0 \\cdot P(X_i=0)) = (1 \\cdot p) + (0 \\cdot (1-p)) = p\n$$\nThe problem demands we use the principle of linearity of expectation. The expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expectations. This property holds regardless of whether the variables are independent. Applying this principle to $X$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbb{E}[X_i]\n$$\nSince $\\mathbb{E}[X_i] = p$ for all $i = 1, \\dots, n$, the sum becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p = np\n$$\nThis is the expression for the expectation of $X$.\n\nNext, we derive the variance $\\mathrm{Var}(X)$. The problem specifies that the segregation events for different chromosomes are independent. This implies that the random variables $X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n$ are mutually independent. For a sum of independent random variables, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances. We must first find the variance of a single Bernoulli variable, $\\mathrm{Var}(X_i)$.\n\nThe variance of a random variable $Y$ is defined as $\\mathrm{Var}(Y) = \\mathbb{E}[Y^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[Y])^2$. We have already found that $\\mathbb{E}[X_i] = p$. We now need to compute $\\mathbb{E}[X_i^2]$. Since $X_i$ only takes values $0$ and $1$, the variable $X_i^2$ is identical to $X_i$ because $0^2 = 0$ and $1^2 = 1$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_i^2] = \\mathbb{E}[X_i] = p\n$$\nNow we can compute the variance of $X_i$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(X_i) = \\mathbb{E}[X_i^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[X_i])^2 = p - p^2 = p(1-p)\n$$\nAs the variables $\\{X_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ are independent, the variance of their sum is the sum of their variances:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathrm{Var}(X_i)\n$$\nSince $\\mathrm{Var}(X_i) = p(1-p)$ for all $i$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p(1-p) = np(1-p)\n$$\nThis is the expression for the variance of $X$.\n\nThe problem asks for the pair $(\\mathbb{E}[X], \\mathrm{Var}(X))$, which we have derived to be $(np, np(1-p))$. It is noted that $X$ follows a binomial distribution, $X \\sim B(n,p)$, and these are the well-known expectation and variance for such a distribution.

Junctions often show short microhomology consistent with non-homologous end-joining.\n- Breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycles yield iterative breakage and rejoining at dysfunctional telomeres, producing: (i) stepwise CN increases (a ladder or ramp) toward the telomere, (ii) enrichment of fold-back inversions (head-to-head) at cycle boundaries, and (iii) extension over large chromosome-arm scales with telomeric involvement.\n- Replication-based templated insertion (also termed chromoanasynthesis) involves template switching during replication, producing series of duplications and templated insertions: (i) enrichment for head-to-tail junctions, (ii) frequent templated insertions from nearby or distant loci, and (iii) multi-state CN gains above baseline.\n- Extrachromosomal circular DNA (double minutes) creates circular amplicons: (i) closed cycles of junctions, (ii) very high focal CN (often much greater than baseline), and (iii) frequent rearrangements into or out of the circular amplicon.\n- Kataegis refers to localized hypermutation of base substitutions, not primarily to dense SV clusters with oscillatory CN, and is often copy-number neutral.\n\nAssessment of the observations:\n\n- The CN alternates strictly between two low states, $C=\\{1,2\\}$, across $24$ segments with $23$ switch-points, and $21$ of $23$ switch-points coincide with SV breakpoints within $<5\\,\\mathrm{kb}$. This two-state oscillation tightly coupled to breakpoints is a hallmark of chromothripsis. It is inconsistent with the stepwise multi-level CN gains typical of BFB or chromoanasynthesis, and inconsistent with the very high CN of double minutes.\n- The $28$ intrachromosomal junctions are confined to a $40\\,\\mathrm{Mb}$ region, with a median inter-breakpoint spacing of $120\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ and $>80\\%$ of breakpoints localized within the interval. This supports a localized, one-off catastrophic event rather than genome-wide or arm-wide progressive processes.

This lack of a strong enrichment for fold-back inversions argues against BFB. It also does not show a dominance of head-to-tail consistent with serial tandem duplications that would support chromoanasynthesis. Interleaved orientations are compatible with chromothripsis, wherein fragment joins are near-random (modulo constraints of viability).\n- There are no segments with CN $>3$, and no CN ramps or ladders. This contradicts BFB (which produces stepwise increases) and double minutes (which produce very high CN). The baseline outside the focal region remains CN $=2$, consistent with a localized event.\n- Junction microhomology is short (median $1\\,\\mathrm{bp}$), compatible with non-homologous end joining expected in chromothripsis. Chromoanasynthesis often presents templated insertions and replication microhomology; here templated insertions are rare and short ($<20\\,\\mathrm{bp}$) and there are no multi-megabase templated insertions from other chromosomes.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. One-off shattering and reassembly of a single chromosome arm (chromothripsis).

Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. Breakage-fusion-bridge cycles. Expected are CN ladders or ramps toward the telomere and an enrichment of fold-back inversions (head-to-head) near cycle junctions. The observed CN is strictly two-state without a ramp, and orientation counts do not show a fold-back inversion enrichment. The event is focal and does not implicate telomere-driven cycles. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. Replication-based templated insertion (chromoanasynthesis). This mechanism predicts abundant templated insertions from proximal and distal loci, and enrichment of head-to-tail duplications with multi-level CN gains above baseline. The observations show rare, short templated insertions, balanced orientation classes, and no CN states above $2$ except transient loss to $1$, contrary to expectations. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. Extrachromosomal circular DNA amplification (double minutes). Hallmarks include circular junction graphs and very high CN amplification. The CN never exceeds $3$ and in fact oscillates between $1$ and $2$, and there is no evidence of circular junction cycles or extreme amplification. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nE. A genome-wide hypermutation process without structural reassembly (kataegis). The defining feature of kataegis is clustered single-nucleotide variants, not dense SV clusters with CN oscillation.

This requires a three-step process: first, deriving the theoretical models for the observables; second, calculating the likelihood of the observed data under each candidate state; and third, computing the Bayes factor from the likelihoods.\n\nFirst, we derive the expressions for the expected segment-level log-ratio, $\\mu_{R}$, and the expected lower-cluster mean B-allele frequency, $\\mu_{B}$, for a generic tumor state with total copy number $C_{T} = C_{A}+C_{B}$ and minor-allele copy number $C_{\\min}=\\min(C_{A},C_{B})$.
