Under Knudson’s two-hit hypothesis, a tumor arises once both alleles of a tumor suppressor gene are inactivated in the same lineage. Assume homogeneous age-dependent rates in the following precise sense: the waiting time to a somatic inactivation event (a “hit”) for a susceptible allele in the relevant cell lineage is exponentially distributed with a constant rate. All hit events are independent.\n\nConsider two etiological classes:\n1. Hereditary retinoblastoma: one inactivating hit is present in the germline at birth, so only one additional somatic hit is required.\n2.

The core of the model is that the waiting time for each somatic \"hit\" is an exponentially distributed random variable with a constant rate.\n\nFirst, we analyze the hereditary case, denoted by $I_{\\mathrm{her}}(t)$. In this class, individuals are born with one inactivated allele. Therefore, only a single somatic hit is required to initiate a tumor. Let the constant rate of this somatic hit be $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{her}} > 0$. The waiting time for this hit, let us call it $T_{\\mathrm{her}}$, follows an exponential distribution with parameter $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{her}}$.\n\nThe cumulative incidence $I_{\\mathrm{her}}(t)$ is the probability that this single hit has occurred by age $t$.

In this class, an individual is born with two functional alleles. A tumor arises only after two independent somatic hits occur sequentially in the same cell lineage. Let the constant rate for each of these hits be $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{spo}} > 0$.\nLet $T_1$ be the waiting time for the first hit, and $T_2$ be the waiting time for the second hit after the first has occurred.

Consider a clonal population of proliferating progenitor cells in which every cell already carries a first hit at $T$ (i.e., cells are heterozygous $a/A$ with the mutant allele $a$ and the wild-type allele $A$). Over a fixed observation window, each cell undergoes divisions in which the second hit can arise by two mutually exclusive mechanisms:\n\n- Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) via mitotic recombination: define $r$ as the per cell division probability that a single mitotic recombination crossover occurs between $T$ and its centromere on homologous chromosomes. Such an event yields two daughter cells with reciprocal LOH: one becomes homozygous mutant $a/a$ and the other becomes homozygous wild type $A/A$, so exactly one second-hit $a/a$ daughter is produced per such event.\n\n- Point mutation of the remaining wild-type allele: define $u$ as the per chromatid replication probability that the wild-type allele $A$ acquires an inactivating point mutation during S phase that is transmitted to a daughter cell. Because the $A$ allele is replicated into two sister chromatids prior to mitosis, there are $2$ independent chromatid targets per division, each with probability $u$; assume $u \\ll 1$ so that multiple hits in the same division are negligible and independence across targets is a valid rare-event approximation.\n\nAssume events are rare so that across the population and time window, (i) per division mechanisms act independently and at most one second-hit mechanism occurs per division, (ii) lineages do not acquire more than one second hit within the window, and (iii) population growth details only scale counts but do not bias the competition between mechanisms.\n\nUnder these assumptions and starting from first principles of competing rare events, compute the expected fraction of all second hits attributable to Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) among all second hits arising in the population during the window. Express your answer as a simplified symbolic expression in terms of $r$ and $u$ only. No numerical evaluation is required, and no units are needed.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the expected fraction of second hits in a tumor suppressor gene, $T$, that are attributable to Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) versus those attributable to point mutation. The initial cell population is heterozygous, carrying one mutant allele ($a$) and one wild-type allele ($A$). A second hit results in a homozygous mutant genotype, $a/a$.\n\nWe must first establish the probabilities of a second hit occurring via each of the two specified mechanisms during a single cell division. Let us denote the event of a second hit by LOH during one division as $E_{LOH}$ and the event of a second hit by point mutation as $E_{PM}$.\n\n1.  **Probability of a second hit via Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH):**\n    The problem defines $r$ as the per-cell-division probability of a mitotic recombination event that leads to LOH. It is explicitly stated that such an event produces exactly one daughter cell with the $a/a$ genotype. Therefore, the probability of generating a second-hit cell via LOH in a single division is directly given by:\n    $$ P(E_{LOH}) = r $$\n\n2.  **Probability of a second hit via Point Mutation (PM):**\n    The problem defines $u$ as the per-chromatid-replication probability of an inactivating mutation occurring at the wild-type allele $A$. Prior to mitosis, during the S phase, cellular DNA is replicated. The chromosome carrying the wild-type allele $A$ is duplicated into two sister chromatids, each carrying an allele $A$. This presents two independent targets for a point mutation. Let us calculate the probability that at least one of these two targets acquires a mutation.\n\n    The probability that a single chromatid's $A$ allele does *not* mutate is $(1 - u)$.\n    Since the mutations on the two sister chromatids are independent events, the probability that *neither* chromatid acquires a mutation is the product of their individual probabilities of not mutating:\n    $$ P(\\text{no mutation}) = (1 - u) \\times (1 - u) = (1 - u)^2 $$\n    The probability of at least one mutation occurring, which is the event $E_{PM}$, is the complement of no mutation occurring:\n    $$ P(E_{PM}) = 1 - P(\\text{no mutation}) = 1 - (1 - u)^2 $$\n    Expanding the squared term, we get:\n    $$ P(E_{PM}) = 1 - (1 - 2u + u^2) = 2u - u^2 $$\n    The problem provides the assumption that $u \\ll 1$. This allows us to neglect the second-order term $u^2$ as it is significantly smaller than the first-order term $2u$. This is a standard approximation for rare events.\n    Thus, the probability of a point mutation event occurring per division is well-approximated by:\n    $$ P(E_{PM}) \\approx 2u $$\n    An event of point mutation on one of the two $A$ chromatids results in one of the two daughter cells receiving a newly mutated allele, making it of genotype $a/a$ and thus constituting a second hit.\n\n3.  **Competition between mechanisms:**\n    The problem states that LOH and point mutation are mutually exclusive mechanisms. Therefore, the total probability of a second hit occurring in a single cell division, $P_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the probabilities of each mechanism:\n    $$ P_{\\text{total}} = P(E_{LOH}) + P(E_{PM}) = r + 2u $$\n    We are asked to find the expected fraction of all second hits that are attributable to LOH. In a scenario with a large number of independent trials (cell divisions), the expected fraction of outcomes of a specific type is equal to the probability of that event type occurring, conditioned on any of the considered events happening.\n\n    Let $F_{LOH}$ be the desired fraction. This fraction is the ratio of the probability of a second hit by LOH to the total probability of any second hit:\n    $$ F_{LOH} = \\frac{P(E_{LOH})}{P_{\\text{total}}} $$\n    Substituting the derived probabilities into this expression gives:\n    $$ F_{LOH} = \\frac{r}{r + 2u} $$\n    This final symbolic expression represents the fraction of second hits caused by LOH, derived from first principles as requested.
