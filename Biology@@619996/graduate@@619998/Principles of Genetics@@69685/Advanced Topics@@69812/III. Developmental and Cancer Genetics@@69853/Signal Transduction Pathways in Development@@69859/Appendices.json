Activation of Wnt inhibits the Axin–adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) destruction complex, effectively reducing the first-order degradation rate constant from $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$ to $\\alpha k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$, where $0<\\alpha<1$. Assume the following:\n- On the timescale over which degradation and synthesis determine steady state, nuclear–cytoplasmic shuttling is fast and linear, such that the nuclear fraction $f_{\\mathrm{nuc}}$ of total cellular $\\beta$-catenin at steady state is independent of Wnt.\n- The synthesis rate $s$, the pre-Wnt degradation rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$, and the nuclear fraction $f_{\\mathrm{nuc}}$ are otherwise unaffected by Wnt activation.\n- The total cellular pool of $\\beta$-catenin is well mixed for the purposes of synthesis and degradation, so its time evolution is governed by the core mass-balance principle: the rate of change equals synthesis minus first-order degradation.\n\nStarting from these principles, derive the steady-state nuclear $\\beta$-catenin level before and after Wnt activation and compute the fold change in steady-state nuclear $\\beta$-catenin upon Wnt activation. Express your final answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $\\alpha$ only. Also state how the fold change scales with $\\alpha$.

The final answer must be a single expression.", "solution": "The problem as stated is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nLet $B(t)$ represent the total cellular concentration of $\\beta$-catenin at time $t$. The dynamics of this concentration are governed by the mass-balance principle, which states that the rate of change is the rate of synthesis minus the rate of degradation. This is expressed as a first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dB(t)}{dt} = s - k B(t)\n$$\nwhere $s$ is the constant synthesis rate and $k$ is the first-order degradation rate constant.\n\nWe must determine the steady-state concentration of nuclear $\\beta$-catenin under two conditions: before and after Wnt activation.\n\nFirst, consider the system before Wnt activation. In this state, the degradation rate constant is given as $k = k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$. The governing equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dB(t)}{dt} = s - k_{\\mathrm{deg}} B(t)\n$$\nAt steady state, the concentration of $\\beta$-catenin does not change with time, so $\\frac{dB(t)}{dt} = 0$. Let $B_{\\mathrm{ss, -Wnt}}$ be the total steady-state concentration of $\\beta$-catenin before Wnt activation. We solve the algebraic equation:\n$$\n0 = s - k_{\\mathrm{deg}} B_{\\mathrm{ss, -Wnt}}\n$$\n$$\nB_{\\mathrm{ss, -Wnt}} = \\frac{s}{k_{\\mathrm{deg}}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that a fraction $f_{\\mathrm{nuc}}$ of the total $\\beta$-catenin is located in the nucleus. Thus, the steady-state nuclear concentration, $N_{\\mathrm{ss, -Wnt}}$, is:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{ss, -Wnt}} = f_{\\mathrm{nuc}} B_{\\mathrm{ss, -Wnt}} = f_{\\mathrm{nuc}} \\frac{s}{k_{\\mathrm{deg}}}\n$$\n\nNext, consider the system after Wnt activation. The activation of the Wnt pathway inhibits the degradation machinery, reducing the degradation rate constant to $k = \\alpha k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$, where $0 < \\alpha < 1$. The synthesis rate $s$ and the nuclear fraction $f_{\\mathrm{nuc}}$ are stated to be unaffected. The new governing equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dB(t)}{dt} = s - (\\alpha k_{\\mathrm{deg}}) B(t)\n$$\nAt steady state, $\\frac{dB(t)}{dt} = 0$. Let $B_{\\mathrm{ss, +Wnt}}$ be the total steady-state concentration after Wnt activation. We solve:\n$$\n0 = s - \\alpha k_{\\mathrm{deg}} B_{\\mathrm{ss, +Wnt}}\n$$\n$$\nB_{\\mathrm{ss, +Wnt}} = \\frac{s}{\\alpha k_{\\mathrm{deg}}}\n$$\nThe corresponding steady-state nuclear concentration, $N_{\\mathrm{ss, +Wnt}}$, is:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{ss, +Wnt}} = f_{\\mathrm{nuc}} B_{\\mathrm{ss, +Wnt}} = f_{\\mathrm{nuc}} \\frac{s}{\\alpha k_{\\mathrm{deg}}}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the fold change in steady-state nuclear $\\beta$-catenin upon Wnt activation. The fold change, which we denote as $FC$, is the ratio of the steady-state concentration after activation to the concentration before activation.\n$$\nFC = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{ss, +Wnt}}}{N_{\\mathrm{ss, -Wnt}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions:\n$$\nFC = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{nuc}} \\frac{s}{\\alpha k_{\\mathrm{deg}}}}{f_{\\mathrm{nuc}} \\frac{s}{k_{\\mathrm{deg}}}}\n$$\nThe parameters $s$, $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$, and $f_{\\mathrm{nuc}}$ are constants that cancel out from the numerator and denominator.\n$$\nFC = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}{1} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\n$$\nThis expression for the fold change depends only on the inhibition factor $\\alpha$, as required.\n\nRegarding the scaling of the fold change with $\\alpha$, the relationship is $FC = \\alpha^{-1}$. This indicates that the fold change is inversely proportional to $\\alpha$. As $\\alpha$ becomes smaller (stronger inhibition of degradation), the fold change in nuclear $\\beta$-catenin increases. Since $0 < \\alpha < 1$, the fold change is always greater than $1$, which is consistent with the known activating role of the Wnt pathway.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}\n$$", "id": "2850923"}, {"introduction": "While quantitative models explain a pathway's input-output properties, classical and molecular genetics provide the tools to dissect the pathway's internal logic and component architecture.

You want to distinguish how different genetic perturbations of Wnt pathway components reveal necessity, sufficiency, molecular mechanism, and spatiotemporal expression. Your starting principles are: the Central Dogma ($\\text{DNA} \\rightarrow \\text{RNA} \\rightarrow \\text{Protein}$), the definition that a loss-of-function allele abolishes or reduces protein activity, a dominant-negative allele interferes with the function of the wild-type protein by forming nonfunctional complexes or sequestering shared inputs, a constitutively active allele mimics the activated state of a signaling effector independently of upstream input, and a knock-in reporter allele places a detectable tag (for example, Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)) at the endogenous locus to report protein expression without altering upstream ligand availability. You also use the following well-tested facts: canonical Wnt signaling requires a receptor complex composed of Frizzled and co-receptor Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein $6$ (Lrp6) to stabilize $\\beta$-catenin; stabilized $\\beta$-catenin accumulates and activates T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) target genes (for example, Axin2); Notch signaling operates largely in parallel and is not downstream of Wnt; mosaic analysis allows inference of cell autonomy by comparing mutant clones to neighboring wild-type cells within the same tissue.\n\nYou engineer the following four alleles in mouse embryonic tissue:\n\n- Allele $1$ (loss-of-function): A frameshift in Lrp6 near the start codon that yields no detectable Lrp6 protein.\n- Allele $2$ (dominant-negative): A knock-in at the Lrp6 locus that deletes the cytoplasmic tail and fuses the extracellular domain to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, producing a membrane-tethered ligand-binding “decoy” that cannot signal but can bind Wnt ligands and Frizzled.\n- Allele $3$ (constitutively active): A Cre-dependent deletion of exon $3$ in Ctnnb1 (encoding $\\beta$-catenin), preventing phosphorylation-dependent degradation and thereby stabilizing $\\beta$-catenin.\n- Allele $4$ (knock-in reporter): An in-frame C-terminal GFP fusion at the endogenous Lrp6 locus that yields Lrp6–GFP under native regulatory control.\n\nYou also carry a separately engineered endogenous Wnt transcriptional reporter of pathway output (Axin2 promoter driving a fast-decaying fluorescent protein) and an endogenous Notch reporter (Hes1 promoter driving a fluorescent protein).

It is not scientifically unsound, incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, or ill-posed.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\nDerivation of the Solution\nThe task is to map each allele ($1, 2, 3, 4$) to the corresponding observation variable ($X, Y, Z, W$) based on its specific molecular mechanism.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Allele $X$ and Observation $\\mathrm{R}1$**: Observation $\\mathrm{R}1$ describes a cell-autonomous loss of $Wnt$ pathway activity ($Axin2$ reporter reduction). A cell-autonomous effect means the phenotype is restricted to the mutant cell itself.\n    - **Allele $1$ (LOF $Lrp6$)**: A cell lacking the essential co-receptor $Lrp6$ cannot transduce the $Wnt$ signal. This defect is intrinsic to the cell. Neighboring wild-type cells with functional $Lrp6$ are unaffected. This perfectly matches the cell-autonomous loss of function in $\\mathrm{R}1$.\n    - **Conclusion**: $X$ corresponds to Allele $1$. This experiment demonstrates the **necessity** of $Lrp6$ for a cell to respond to $Wnt$ ligand.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Allele $Y$ and Observation $\\mathrm{R}2$**: Observation $\\mathrm{R}2$ describes a non-cell-autonomous loss of $Wnt$ pathway activity, where mutant cells suppress signaling in their wild-type neighbors.\n    - **Allele $2$ (DN $Lrp6$)**: This allele produces a membrane-bound \"decoy\" receptor that can bind and sequester diffusible $Wnt$ ligands from the extracellular environment. By doing so, it depletes the ligand not only for itself but also for nearby cells, preventing them from activating their functional $Wnt$ receptors. This \"ligand sink\" effect is precisely the mechanism for the non-cell-autonomous suppression of signaling described in $\\mathrm{R}2$. The lack of effect on the $Notch$ reporter is consistent with the pathways being parallel.\n    - **Conclusion**: $Y$ corresponds to Allele $2$. This experiment reveals a mechanism of non-autonomy through **extracellular ligand sequestration**.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Allele $Z$ and Observation $\\mathrm{R}3$**: Observation $\\mathrm{R}3$ describes cell-autonomous, ectopic activation of the $Wnt$ pathway, which is independent of the upstream receptor $Lrp6$.\n    - **Allele $3$ (CA $\\beta$-catenin)**: This allele creates a stabilized form of $\\beta$-catenin, the key downstream effector of the canonical $Wnt$ pathway. Stabilized $\\beta$-catenin will accumulate and activate target genes like $Axin2$ irrespective of upstream signals (i.e., presence of $Wnt$ ligand and receptors). The effect is cell-autonomous as $\\beta$-catenin is an intracellular protein. The observation that the effect persists when $Lrp6$ is knocked out is a classic epistasis experiment, proving that $\\beta$-catenin acts downstream of $Lrp6$. This matches $\\mathrm{R}3$ in every detail.\n    - **Conclusion**: $Z$ corresponds to Allele $3$. This experiment demonstrates the **sufficiency** of stabilized $\\beta$-catenin to activate the pathway and confirms its epistatic relationship to the receptor.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Allele $W$ and Observation $\\mathrm{R}4$**: Observation $\\mathrm{R}4$ describes visualizing a protein's expression pattern and showing that its presence alone does not activate the signaling pathway.\n    - **Allele $4$ (KI $Lrp6–GFP$ reporter)**: This allele is designed to report the endogenous expression pattern of $Lrp6$ protein by tagging it with $GFP$. The observation of a dorsally-enriched plasma membrane signal is the expected output of such a reporter. The crucial part of $\\mathrm{R}4$ is that pathway activity ($Axin2$ reporter) still depends on the $Wnt$ source. This confirms that the $Lrp6–GFP$ protein behaves like the wild-type receptor component: its presence is necessary (as shown by Allele $1$) but not sufficient for signaling; the ligand is also required.\n    - **Conclusion**: $W$ corresponds to Allele $4$. This allele reveals the **spatiotemporal expression and subcellular localization** of the $Lrp6$ protein.\n\n**Summary of Mapping**:\n- $X = 1$ (LOF $Lrp6$)\n- $Y = 2$ (DN $Lrp6$)\n- $Z = 3$ (CA $\\beta$-catenin)\n- $W = 4$ (KI $Lrp6-GFP$)\nThe correct mapping is $(X,Y,Z,W) = (1,2,3,4)$.\n\nOption-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $(X,Y,Z,W) = (1,2,3,4)$.

We find the fixed points by exhaustively testing each of the 8 states for each test case.\n\nThe update rule for each node $x \\in \\{W, N, B\\}$ depends on the presence of active activators ($A_x$) and inhibitors ($I_x$):\n- If only activators are present ($A_x$ is true, $I_x$ is false), $F_x(s) = 1$.\n- If only inhibitors are present ($I_x$ is true, $A_x$ is false), $F_x(s) = 0$.\n- If no active regulators are present ($A_x$ and $I_x$ are false), $F_x(s) = b_x$.\n- If both activators and inhibitors are present, apply the tie-breaking rule.\n\n**Test Case 1**: $S=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 & -1\\\\ -1 & 0 & +1\\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$, $b=(0,0,1)$, $\\text{tie}=\\mathrm{I}$ (Inhibitor-dominant).\nWe check all 8 states:\n- $s=(0,0,0) \\to F(s)=b=(0,0,1)$. Not a fixed point.\n- $s=(0,0,1) \\to F_W(\\text{I from B})=0, F_N(\\text{A from B})=1, F_B(\\text{no regs})=b_B=1 \\to (0,1,1)$. Not a fixed point.\n- $s=(0,1,0) \\to F_W(\\text{I from N})=0, F_N(\\text{no regs})=b_N=0, F_B(\\text{no regs})=b_B=1 \\to (0,0,1)$. Not a fixed point.\n- $s=(0,1,1) \\to F_W(\\text{I-tie from N,B})=0, F_N(\\text{A from B})=1, F_B(\\text{no regs})=b_B=1 \\to (0,1,1)$. This is a **fixed point**. Code: $4 \\cdot 0 + 2 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 3$.\n- $s=(1,0,0) \\to F_W(\\text{no regs})=b_W=0, F_N(\\text{I from W})=0, F_B(\\text{I from W})=0 \\to (0,0,0)$. Not a fixed point.\n- $s=(1,0,1) \\to F_W(\\text{I from B})=0, F_N(\\text{I-tie from W,B})=0, F_B(\\text{I from W})=0 \\to (0,0,0)$. Not a fixed point.\n- $s=(1,1,0) \\to F_W(\\text{I from N})=0, F_N(\\text{I from W})=0, F_B(\\text{I from W})=0 \\to (0,0,0)$. Not a fixed point.\n- $s=(1,1,1) \\to F_W(\\text{I-tie})=0, F_N(\\text{I-tie})=0, F_B(\\text{I from W})=0 \\to (0,0,0)$. Not a fixed point.\nThe only fixed point for Test Case 1 is $(0,1,1)$, code $3$.\n\n**Test Case 2**: $S=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & +1 & -1\\\\ +1 & 0 & -1\\\\ -1 & -1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$, $b=(1,0,0)$, $\\text{tie}=\\mathrm{A}$ (Activator-dominant).\nWe check all 8 states:\n- $s=(1,1,0) \\to F_W(\\text{A from N})=1, F_N(\\text{A from W})=1, F_B(\\text{I from W,N})=0 \\to (1,1,0)$. This is a **fixed point**. Code: $4 \\cdot 1 + 2 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 0 = 6$.\n- Checking other states reveals they all eventually flow into this fixed point. For example, $s=(0,0,0) \\to b=(1,0,0)$, and $s=(1,0,0) \\to F(s)=(1,1,0)$.\nThe only fixed point for Test Case 2 is $(1,1,0)$, code $6$.\n\n**Test Case 3**: $S=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$, $b=(0,1,0)$, $\\text{tie}=\\mathrm{P}$ (Persistence).\n- Since the interaction matrix $S$ is the zero matrix, there are never any active regulators. The update rule simplifies to $F_x(s) = b_x$ for all nodes $x$ and any state $s$.\n- Therefore, for any state $s$, the next state is always $F(s) = b = (0,1,0)$.\n- A fixed point $s^\\star$ must satisfy $s^\\star = F(s^\\star)$. Substituting the update function, this means $s^\\star = b$.\n- The only fixed point is the basal state itself: $s^\\star = (0,1,0)$.\n- The code for this state is $4 \\cdot 0 + 2 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 0 = 2$.\nThe only fixed point for Test Case 3 is $(0,1,0)$, code $2$.\n\nAggregating the results, we find the sets of fixed-point codes for the three cases.
