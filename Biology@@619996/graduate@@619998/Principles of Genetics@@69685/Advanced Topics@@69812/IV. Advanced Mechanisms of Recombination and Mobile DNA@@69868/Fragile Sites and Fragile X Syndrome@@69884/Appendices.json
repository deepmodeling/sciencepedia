It is therefore valid. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nLet $p$ represent the frequency of the premutation allele for the *FMR1* gene in the population's gene pool. Let $q$ represent the frequency of the normal, or non-premutation, allele. Assuming these are the only two alleles under consideration at this locus, their frequencies must sum to unity:\n$$p + q = 1$$\n\nThe problem is set in the context of an X-linked locus. Males are hemizygous for the X chromosome, possessing only a single copy. Therefore, under the assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium where allele frequencies are equal in both sexes, the frequency of a given phenotype in males is directly equal to the frequency of the corresponding allele in the gene pool.\n\nThe prevalence of premutation males is given as $1$ in $400$. This directly provides the frequency of the premutation allele, $p$.\n$$p = \\frac{1}{400} = 0.0025$$\n\nUsing this value, we can immediately calculate the frequency of the normal allele, $q$:\n$$q = 1 - p = 1 - 0.0025 = 0.9975$$\n\nFemales are diploid for the X chromosome. At Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the genotype frequencies in females are determined by the random combination of alleles, following the binomial expansion $(p+q)^2 = 1$. The frequencies for the three possible female genotypes are:\n1.  Homozygous for the premutation allele ($X^pX^p$): frequency = $p^2$\n2.  Heterozygous, with one premutation and one normal allele ($X^pX^n$): frequency = $2pq$\n3.  Homozygous for the normal allele ($X^nX^n$): frequency = $q^2$\n\nThe problem defines a female \"premutation carrier\" as any female with at least one premutation allele. This definition encompasses both homozygous premutation females (frequency $p^2$) and heterozygous females (frequency $2pq$). The total expected prevalence of female premutation carriers is the sum of these two frequencies:\n$$\\text{Prevalence of female carriers} = p^2 + 2pq$$\n\nAn equivalent and algebraically simpler method is to calculate the frequency of females who are *not* carriers and subtract this value from $1$. The only non-carrier genotype is homozygous normal ($X^nX^n$), which has a frequency of $q^2$.\n$$\\text{Prevalence of female carriers} = 1 - (\\text{frequency of non-carriers}) = 1 - q^2$$\nWe can confirm the equivalence of these two expressions: $p^2 + 2pq = p(p+2q) = p(1+q)$. And since $p=1-q$, this is $(1-q)(1+q) = 1-q^2$. The expressions are identical.\n\nWe will now compute the numerical value using the second, more direct formula.\n$$\\text{Prevalence of female carriers} = 1 - q^2 = 1 - (0.9975)^2$$\nCalculating the square of $q$:\n$$(0.9975)^2 = 0.99500625$$\nSubstituting this back into the prevalence equation:\n$$\\text{Prevalence of female carriers} = 1 - 0.99500625 = 0.00499375$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.

This posterior probability is $P(F \\mid L=85, A_2)$.\n\nWe begin by applying Bayes' theorem. Let the specific context be defined by the allele length $L=85$. The theorem states:\n$$\nP(F \\mid A_2, L=85) = \\frac{P(A_2 \\mid F, L=85) P(F \\mid L=85)}{P(A_2 \\mid L=85)}\n$$\nThe term in the denominator, $P(A_2 \\mid L=85)$, is the marginal probability of observing $A_2$ for an allele of length $L=85$.

The problem states that the unconditional expansion risk, $P(F \\mid L)$, is a linear function of $L$ over the interval $L \\in [70, 90]$. Let this function be $P(F \\mid L) = mL + c$. We are given two points on this line: $(L_1, P_1) = (70, 0.02)$ and $(L_2, P_2) = (90, 0.30)$.\nThe slope $m$ of the line is calculated as:\n$$\nm = \\frac{P_2 - P_1}{L_2 - L_1} = \\frac{0.30 - 0.02}{90 - 70} = \\frac{0.28}{20} = 0.014\n$$\nUsing the point-slope form with $(L_1, P_1)$, we find the equation of the line:\n$$\nP(F \\mid L) - 0.02 = 0.014(L - 70)\n$$\n$$\nP(F \\mid L) = 0.014L - 0.014 \\times 70 + 0.02 = 0.014L - 0.98 + 0.02 = 0.014L - 0.96\n$$\nNow, we can compute the prior probability for $L=85$:\n$$\nP(F \\mid L=85) = 0.014 \\times 85 - 0.96 = 1.19 - 0.96 = 0.23\n$$\nThe complementary probability, the probability of no expansion, is:\n$$\nP(\\overline{F} \\mid L=85) = 1 - P(F \\mid L=85) = 1 - 0.23 = 0.77\n$$\n\nNext, we address the likelihood terms, $P(A_2 \\mid F, L=85)$ and $P(A_2 \\mid \\overline{F}, L=85)$. The problem provides an explicit modeling assumption: \"the likelihood ratio associated with observing $A_2$ is approximately invariant with respect to the exact value of $L$\". This justifies using the cohort-wide average conditional probabilities for the specific case of $L=85$.\nThus, we take:\n$$\nP(A_2 \\mid F, L=85) \\approx P(A_2 \\mid F, 70 \\le L \\le 90) = 0.10\n$$\n$$\nP(A_2 \\mid \\overline{F}, L=85) \\approx P(A_2 \\mid \\overline{F}, 70 \\le L \\le 90) = 0.45\n$$\n\nWe now have all the necessary components to calculate the posterior probability.

Assume the following fundamental facts: (i) FMR1 transcription is largely silenced when the FMR1 promoter region is methylated, (ii) Southern blot band intensity is proportional to the amount of DNA in that band, and (iii) incomplete digestion by the restriction enzyme can occur, characterized by an empirical digestion efficiency for unmethylated DNA that is less than perfect. Also assume that, in this male, any unmethylated full-mutation allele produces FMR1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) at a constant fractional rate $\\rho$ relative to a normal unmethylated allele due to repeat-length–dependent promoter inefficiency (an empirical calibration constant provided below).\n\nTwo lanes are available for quantitative interpretation (background-subtracted and normalized within each lane so that the sum of all band intensities in the lane equals $1$):\n\n- Calibration lane: normal male control (unmethylated FMR1 promoter), digested with HpaII. The measured intensities are: digested fragments (low-molecular-weight smear), $I^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{\\mathrm{dig}} = 0.928$; residual undigested band, $I^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{\\mathrm{undig}} = 0.072$.\n\n- Patient lane: male with full mutation mosaicism, digested with HpaII.

The reasoning proceeds in three steps: first, determining the experimental digestion efficiency from a control sample; second, using this efficiency to calculate the fraction of unmethylated alleles in the patient; and third, calculating the patient's gene expression based on this fraction and a given transcriptional-inefficiency factor.\n\nStep 1: Determination of HpaII Digestion Efficiency ($E$)\nThe calibration lane uses DNA from a normal male control, whose FMR1 promoter is entirely unmethylated. The restriction enzyme HpaII cleaves unmethylated CpG sites. Therefore, all DNA in this sample is, in principle, susceptible to digestion. The intensity of a band is proportional to the amount of DNA. The data is normalized such that the sum of intensities in a lane is $1$.\n\nThe effective digestion efficiency, denoted as $E$, is the fraction of susceptible DNA that is successfully cleaved. In the control lane, all DNA is susceptible, so $E$ is simply the fraction of total DNA found in the digested fragments. This corresponds to the measured intensity $I^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{\\mathrm{dig}}$.\n$$E = I^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{\\mathrm{dig}}$$\nThe fraction of DNA that remains undigested despite being unmethylated corresponds to the intensity of the undigested band, $I^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{\\mathrm{undig}}$. This fraction is equal to $1 - E$.\n$$1 - E = I^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{\\mathrm{undig}}$$\nUsing the provided data for the calibration lane, $I^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{\\mathrm{dig}} = 0.928$ and $I^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{\\mathrm{undig}} = 0.072$.\nFrom the first equation, we find the efficiency:\n$$E = 0.928$$\nThis value is consistent with the second equation, as $1 - 0.928 = 0.072$, which matches the given $I^{\\mathrm{ref}}_{\\mathrm{undig}}$.\n\nStep 2: Calculation of the Fraction of Unmethylated Alleles in the Patient ($f_U$)\nThe patient has full mutation mosaicism, meaning his body contains a mixture of cells with methylated and unmethylated FMR1 promoters. Let $f_U$ be the fraction of alleles that are unmethylated and $f_M$ be the fraction that are methylated. As he is male, he has one X chromosome, so we consider a single population of alleles from his cells, where $f_U + f_M = 1$.\n\nThe HpaII enzyme digests only the unmethylated fraction, $f_U$, with the efficiency $E$ determined above. Therefore, the intensity of the digested fragments in the patient's lane, $I^{\\mathrm{pat}}_{\\mathrm{dig}}$, is the product of the unmethylated fraction and the digestion efficiency.\n$$I^{\\mathrm{pat}}_{\\mathrm{dig}} = f_U \\times E$$\nThe undigested band in the patient's lane, with intensity $I^{\\mathrm{pat}}_{\\mathrm{undig}}$, consists of two components: the fraction of alleles that are methylated and thus inherently resistant to digestion ($f_M$), and the fraction of unmethylated alleles that escaped digestion ($f_U \\times (1-E)$).\n$$I^{\\mathrm{pat}}_{\\mathrm{undig}} = f_M + f_U (1 - E) = (1 - f_U) + f_U(1-E) = 1 - f_U E$$\nBoth formulations are consistent. We can solve for $f_U$ using the simpler relationship involving the digested fragments:\n$$f_U = \\frac{I^{\\mathrm{pat}}_{\\mathrm{dig}}}{E}$$\nSubstituting the given patient data, $I^{\\mathrm{pat}}_{\\mathrm{dig}} = 0.2784$, and the calculated efficiency, $E = 0.928$:\n$$f_U = \\frac{0.2784}{0.928} = 0.3$$\nThis means $30\\%$ of the patient's FMR1 alleles are unmethylated.\n\nStep 3: Prediction of Residual FMR1 Expression\nGene expression from the FMR1 locus is assumed to be completely silenced when the promoter is methylated. Expression occurs only from the unmethylated alleles.\nA normal male's FMR1 expression level is used as the reference (relative expression of $1$). Let the mRNA produced by a single normal, unmethylated allele be denoted by a baseline amount $X_{mRNA}$. The normal male's total expression is $E_{\\mathrm{normal}} = 1 \\times X_{mRNA} = X_{mRNA}$.\n\nThe problem specifies that an unmethylated full-mutation allele produces mRNA at a reduced fractional rate of $\\rho = 0.62$ compared to a normal allele. Thus, the expression from a single unmethylated full-mutation allele is $\\rho \\times X_{mRNA}$.\nThe patient's total expression, $E_{\\mathrm{patient}}$, is the sum of expression from his unmethylated and methylated alleles. Since methylated alleles are silent, this is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{patient}} = (f_U \\times \\rho \\times X_{mRNA}) + (f_M \\times 0) = f_U \\rho X_{mRNA}$$\nThe residual expression as a fraction of normal is the ratio $\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{patient}}}{E_{\\mathrm{normal}}}$.\n$$\\text{Residual Expression} = \\frac{f_U \\rho X_{mRNA}}{X_{mRNA}} = f_U \\rho$$\nSubstituting the calculated value $f_U = 0.3$ and the given value $\\rho = 0.62$:\n$$\\text{Residual Expression} = 0.3 \\times 0.62 = 0.186$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be reported to four significant figures.
