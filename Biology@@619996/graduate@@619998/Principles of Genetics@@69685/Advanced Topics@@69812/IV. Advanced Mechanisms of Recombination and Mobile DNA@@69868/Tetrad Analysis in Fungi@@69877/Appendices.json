This practice utilizes data from ordered tetrads, characteristic of fungi like *Neurospora*, where the physical arrangement of spores in the ascus reflects the segregation events of meiosis. By analyzing the frequency of Second-Division Segregation (SDS) patterns, which arise from crossovers between a gene and its centromere, we can directly calculate their genetic distance. This exercise hones your ability to translate raw segregation data into a quantitative map distance, a cornerstone of cytogenetics [@problem_id:2855219].", "problem": "In an ordered tetrad analysis of a filamentous fungus with linear ascus organization (for example, a Neurospora-type ascus), alleles at a single gene were scored for First-Division Segregation (FDS) versus Second-Division Segregation (SDS). By definition, FDS denotes that homologous alleles segregate at the first meiotic division (yielding a contiguous $4:4$ arrangement in the ascus), whereas Second-Division Segregation (SDS) denotes that the alleles segregate at the second division (yielding patterns such as $2:2:2:2$ or $2:4:2$).\n\nAssume the following foundational facts and conditions:\n- In an ordered ascus, SDS at a locus implies that at least one crossover occurred between that locus and the nearest centromere during the meiosis that produced the ascus.\n- In a meiosis exhibiting SDS for the locus, exactly $2$ of the $4$ chromatids are recombinant with respect to the centromere–locus interval, while the other $2$ are nonrecombinant.\n- Chromatid interference is absent and gene conversion or post-meiotic segregation events are negligible for this locus, so that the segregation class reflects crossover placement between the gene and the centromere.\n- Map distance in centiMorgans (cM) is defined as $100$ times the recombination fraction.\n\nYou are given an ordered dataset with $N=120$ asci scored, of which $\\mathrm{SDS}=36$ asci show Second-Division Segregation at the locus.\n\nUsing only the principles above, compute the gene–centromere distance in centiMorgans.

We must validate its premises before proceeding to a solution.\n\nStep 1: Extract Givens.\n- Total number of asci scored: $N=120$.\n- Number of Second-Division Segregation (SDS) asci: $\\mathrm{SDS}=36$.\n- First-Division Segregation (FDS) asci exhibit a $4:4$ pattern.\n- SDS asci exhibit patterns such as $2:2:2:2$ or $2:4:2$.\n- The occurrence of SDS implies at least one crossover event between the gene locus and its centromere.\n- An SDS ascus contains exactly $2$ recombinant chromatids and $2$ nonrecombinant chromatids with respect to the gene-centromere interval.\n- There is no chromatid interference, gene conversion, or post-meiotic segregation.\n- Map distance in centiMorgans (cM) is defined as $100$ times the recombination fraction.\n\nStep 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens.\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as it is based on the established principles of meiotic segregation and genetic mapping in ascomycete fungi like *Neurospora crassa*. The data and definitions provided are self-contained and consistent. The problem is well-posed, objective, and formalizable. There are no violations of scientific principles, logical inconsistencies, or ambiguities. The assumptions provided (e.g., no interference) are standard for simplifying such introductory problems. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nStep 3: Proceed with Solution.\nThe objective is to compute the map distance between the gene locus and the centromere. Map distance, by definition, is a measure of the frequency of recombination. The problem states that the map distance in centiMorgans (cM) is given by the equation:\n$$ \\text{Map Distance (cM)} = 100 \\times (\\text{Recombination Fraction}) $$\n\nThe Recombination Fraction (RF) is the proportion of recombinant meiotic products (spores) among the total number of meiotic products. Each ascus is the result of a single meiosis and contains the four chromatids, which after a mitotic division become eight spores. For genetic purposes, we consider the four chromatids as the four products of one meiosis.\n\nThe total number of meiotic products in the sample is the total number of asci, $N$, multiplied by the number of products per ascus, which is $4$.\n$$ \\text{Total Products} = N \\times 4 = 120 \\times 4 = 480 $$\n\nNext, we must determine the total number of recombinant products. The problem specifies the genetic outcome for each type of ascus:\n- FDS asci result from meioses with no crossover between the gene and the centromere. All $4$ products in an FDS ascus are parental (nonrecombinant).\n- SDS asci result from meioses with a crossover between the gene and the centromere. It is explicitly stated that in an SDS ascus, exactly $2$ of the $4$ products are recombinant.\n\nThe number of FDS asci is the total number of asci minus the number of SDS asci:\n$$ \\text{Number of FDS asci} = N - \\mathrm{SDS} = 120 - 36 = 84 $$\nThe number of recombinant products from these $84$ FDS asci is $84 \\times 0 = 0$.\n\nThe number of recombinant products from the $\\mathrm{SDS}=36$ asci is:\n$$ \\text{Total Recombinant Products} = (\\text{Number of SDS asci}) \\times (\\text{Recombinant products per SDS ascus}) $$\n$$ \\text{Total Recombinant Products} = 36 \\times 2 = 72 $$\n\nNow, we can calculate the Recombination Fraction (RF):\n$$ \\text{RF} = \\frac{\\text{Total Recombinant Products}}{\\text{Total Products}} = \\frac{72}{480} $$\nSimplifying this fraction:\n$$ \\text{RF} = \\frac{72}{480} = \\frac{36}{240} = \\frac{18}{120} = \\frac{9}{60} = \\frac{3}{20} = 0.15 $$\n\nA more direct and equivalent method is to recognize that the frequency of recombinant gametes is exactly half the frequency of SDS asci, because each SDS ascus contributes half of its products ($2$ out of $4$) to the recombinant pool.\n$$ \\text{RF} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of SDS asci}}{\\text{Total number of asci}} \\right) $$\n$$ \\text{RF} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{36}{120} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.3 = 0.15 $$\nThis formulation is standard and correct for gene-centromere mapping.\n\nFinally, we compute the map distance in centiMorgans:\n$$ \\text{Map Distance (cM)} = 100 \\times \\text{RF} = 100 \\times 0.15 = 15 $$\n\nThis value of $15$ cM indicates that the gene is linked to the centromere. It is not so close as to almost always segregate at the first division, but it is close enough that a crossover event between the two occurs in a minority of meioses. Specifically, the frequency of SDS asci ($30\\%$) reflects the frequency of meioses with a crossover in this interval, and the map distance is half of this value.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{15}$$", "id": "2855219"}, {"introduction": "While ordered tetrads provide spatial information, many model organisms like *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* produce unordered tetrads. This exercise shifts our focus to analyzing two-gene linkage using these unordered sets of meiotic products.

The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing all necessary information for a unique solution. There are no violations of scientific principles, logical inconsistencies, or ambiguities.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to determine the fraction of recombinant chromatids in the total population of chromatids from the pooled data. Let this fraction be denoted by $R_c$. This quantity is equivalent to the recombination frequency (RF) calculated at the chromatid level. The maximum-likelihood estimate for a proportion in a large sample is the sample proportion itself. Therefore, we must first derive an expression for this proportion and then compute its value from the given data.\n\nLet $N_{PD}$, $N_{T}$, and $N_{NPD}$ represent the total counts of PD, T, and NPD tetrads, respectively. Each tetrad is comprised of $4$ chromatids (spores). We must determine the number of recombinant chromatids within each tetrad type based on the provided definitions.\n- A Parental Ditype (PD) tetrad contains only parental genotypes. This arises from a meiosis with no crossovers (or a two-strand double crossover) between the loci. For a parental cross of $AB/ab$, the spores are of genotypes $AB, AB, ab, ab$. All $4$ chromatids are of parental type. Thus, the number of recombinant chromatids in a PD tetrad is $0$.\n- A Tetratype (T) tetrad contains both parental and recombinant genotypes. This arises from a single crossover (or a three-strand double crossover) between the loci. The spores are of genotypes $AB, ab, Ab, aB$. Two chromatids ($Ab$ and $aB$) are recombinant, and two ($AB$ and $ab$) are parental. Thus, the number of recombinant chromatids in a T tetrad is $2$.\n- A Nonparental Ditype (NPD) tetrad contains only nonparental (recombinant) genotypes. This arises from a four-strand double crossover between the loci. The spores are of genotypes $Ab, Ab, aB, aB$. All $4$ chromatids are of recombinant type. Thus, the number of recombinant chromatids in an NPD tetrad is $4$.\n\nThe total number of chromatids in the sample is the total number of tetrads multiplied by $4$:\n$$N_{chromatids} = 4 \\times (N_{PD} + N_{T} + N_{NPD})$$\n\nThe total number of recombinant chromatids is the sum of recombinants from each class of tetrad:\n$$N_{recombinant} = (0 \\times N_{PD}) + (2 \\times N_{T}) + (4 \\times N_{NPD}) = 2 N_{T} + 4 N_{NPD}$$\n\nThe fraction of recombinant chromatids, $R_c$, is the ratio of the total number of recombinant chromatids to the total number of chromatids. This is the explicit expression sought:\n$$R_c = \\frac{N_{recombinant}}{N_{chromatids}} = \\frac{2 N_{T} + 4 N_{NPD}}{4 (N_{PD} + N_{T} + N_{NPD})}$$\nThis expression can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by $2$:\n$$R_c = \\frac{N_{T} + 2 N_{NPD}}{2 (N_{PD} + N_{T} + N_{NPD})}$$\nThis is the required expression. Now we compute its value using the pooled data.\n\nFirst, we sum the counts from the three batches:\nTotal PD count: $N_{PD} = 148 + 122 + 130 = 400$\nTotal T count: $N_{T} = 190 + 160 + 178 = 528$\nTotal NPD count: $N_{NPD} = 12 + 8 + 10 = 30$\n\nThe total number of tetrads is $N_{total} = N_{PD} + N_{T} + N_{NPD} = 400 + 528 + 30 = 958$.\n\nNow, we substitute these numerical values into the derived expression for $R_c$:\n$$R_c = \\frac{2 N_{T} + 4 N_{NPD}}{4 N_{total}} = \\frac{(2 \\times 528) + (4 \\times 30)}{4 \\times 958}$$\n$$R_c = \\frac{1056 + 120}{3832}$$\n$$R_c = \\frac{1176}{3832}$$\n\nPerforming the division:\n$$R_c \\approx 0.306889352...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$R_c \\approx 0.3069$$\nThis value represents the maximum-likelihood estimate of the fraction of recombinant chromatids.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3069}$$", "id": "2855177"}, {"introduction": "This advanced problem challenges you to synthesize multiple concepts from tetrad analysis to solve a genetic puzzle.

Using this determination, along with information about one gene's proximity to its centromere, you will deduce the gene-centromere map distance for the second gene. This practice demonstrates the power of tetrad analysis to extract detailed positional information, even in seemingly complex scenarios [@problem_id:1525411].", "problem": "In a genetic study of the budding yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, a diploid strain is created by mating two haploid strains with genotypes `his4 LEU2` and `HIS4 leu2`. The wild-type alleles (`HIS4`, `LEU2`) confer prototrophy, while the mutant alleles (`his4`, `leu2`) lead to auxotrophic requirements for histidine and leucine, respectively. The resulting diploid cells are sporulated to produce asci, each containing a tetrad of four haploid spores. A total of 1000 such tetrads are collected and the genotype of each spore is determined.

This is the characteristic outcome for genes that assort independently. Independent assortment occurs when genes are located on different chromosomes or are very far apart on the same chromosome. Therefore, we conclude that the `HIS4` and `LEU2` genes are unlinked.\n\n**Step 2: Relate Tetratype (T) frequency to gene-centromere crossovers for unlinked genes.**\nFor unlinked genes, Tetratype (T) tetrads are primarily generated when one of the two genes undergoes Second Division Segregation (SDS) due to a crossover between the gene and its centromere, while the other gene undergoes First Division Segregation (FDS).\n\nLet `x` be the frequency of SDS for the `HIS4` gene (which is the frequency of crossing over between `HIS4` and its centromere).\nLet `y` be the frequency of SDS for the `LEU2` gene (which is the frequency of crossing over between `LEU2` and its centromere).\n\nThe frequency of FDS for `HIS4` is `1-x`, and the frequency of FDS for `LEU2` is `1-y`.\n\nNeglecting the rare events of simultaneous crossovers between both genes and their respective centromeres, the frequency of T tetrads, `f(T)`, is the sum of probabilities of the two events that can produce them: (SDS for `HIS4` and FDS for `LEU2`) or (FDS for `HIS4` and SDS for `LEU2`).\n$$f(T) = x(1-y) + (1-x)y = x + y - 2xy$$\n\n**Step 3: Apply the given information about the `HIS4` gene's location.**\nThe problem states that the `HIS4` gene is very close to its centromere, and crossing over between them is negligible. This implies that the `HIS4` gene almost always segregates at the first meiotic division (FDS).
