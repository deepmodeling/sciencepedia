DDE-family transposases create short target-site duplications (TSDs) as direct repeats in the host sequence upon insertion.\n\nStep 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem describes a genetic locus with a specific architecture and provides standard definitions from molecular genetics.\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The description is a textbook case of a prokaryotic transposable element. The structure `IR-gene-IR` is canonical for an IS element. The DDE motif is the signature of the DDE/D-transposase/integrase superfamily, which includes the transposases of most known IS elements. The HTH motif is a common DNA-binding domain found in such proteins. The generation of short direct repeats, known as Target-Site Duplications (TSDs), is the hallmark of transposition for this class of elements. The specified lengths ($23$ $bp$ IRs, $9$ $bp$ TSDs, ~$1$ $kb$ ORF) are all typical for prokaryotic IS elements. The statement is scientifically sound and factually correct.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. The provided definitions and structural data are sufficient to arrive at a unique classification of the element and its components.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is precise and objective.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-defined and scientifically accurate problem in molecular genetics. I will proceed with deriving the solution and evaluating each option.\n\nSolution Derivation\nThe problem requires classification of the described genetic element based on fundamental principles. Let us apply the provided definitions.\n\n1.  **Classification of the Element Type**: The problem defines an Insertion Sequence (IS) element as \"the simplest units carrying a transposase flanked by terminal inverted repeats\". The described structure consists of a single ORF flanked by two $23$ $bp$ perfect inverted repeats. The ORF encodes a protein with a DDE catalytic triad and an HTH DNA-binding domain, which are characteristic features of a transposase protein. This matches the definition of an IS element precisely. It is the \"simplest\" unit because it carries no passenger genes, such as for antibiotic resistance. An element containing such passenger genes in addition to the transposition machinery would be classified as a transposon.\n\n2.  **Identification of Element Boundaries**: The transposable element is the mobile DNA segment itself. In IS elements and many other transposons, the boundaries are defined by the terminal inverted repeats (IRs). The transposase protein recognizes these IR sequences to mediate excision and insertion. Therefore, the mobile unit begins with the left $23$ $bp$ IR and ends with the right $23$ $bp$ IR. The total length of the IS element is the sum of the lengths of the two IRs and the internal sequence: $23$ $bp$ + $1053$ $bp$ + $23$ $bp$ = $1099$ $bp$.\n\n3.  **Identification of the Flanking Repeats**: The problem states that DDE-family transposases generate \"short target-site duplications (TSDs) as direct repeats in the host\". The mechanism involves the transposase making staggered nicks in the target DNA. The transposable element is then ligated to the resulting single-stranded overhangs. Host DNA repair machinery fills in the gaps opposite the overhangs, resulting in a duplication of the target site sequence. These duplicated sequences, the TSDs, flank the inserted element but are part of the host chromosome, not part of the mobile DNA. The observed identical $9$ $bp$ direct repeats immediately outside the IRs perfectly fit this description. They are the footprint left in the host genome by the act of transposition.\n\nConclusion: The described locus is an IS element, whose boundaries are the $23$ $bp$ IRs. The external $9$ $bp$ direct repeats are TSDs belonging to the host DNA.\n\nOption-by-Option Analysis\n\nA. An insertion sequence (IS). The IS unit is bounded internally by the $23$ base pair inverted repeats and contains the DDE transposase ORF; the identical flanking $9$ base pair direct repeats are host target-site duplications and are not part of the IS.\nThis statement is fully consistent with our derivation. It correctly identifies the element as an IS, correctly defines its boundaries as the IRs, and correctly identifies the flanking DRs as host TSDs that are not part of the element.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. A composite transposon. The outermost $9$ base pair direct repeats are the true ends of the transposon and are part of the mobile element; the $23$ base pair inverted repeats are unrelated host palindromes.\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, a composite transposon is typically composed of two IS elements flanking a central region of other genes. This element has only one transposase gene. Second, the direct repeats (TSDs) are not part of the mobile element. Third, dismissing the IRs that flank a transposase gene as \"unrelated palindromes\" is a fundamental misunderstanding of transposable element structure.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. An insertion sequence (IS). The IS unit includes the $23$ base pair inverted repeats and also includes the flanking $9$ base pair direct repeats as its outermost boundaries, such that excision removes the $9$ base pair repeats with the element.\nThis statement correctly identifies the element as an IS but incorrectly includes the $9$ $bp$ direct repeats as part of the mobile unit. The TSDs are a feature of the target site, not the element itself. Precise excision of the IS element would leave one copy of the $9$ $bp$ repeat behind, restoring the original host sequence (or nearly so).\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Not an insertion sequence. Because the DDE motif implies a replicative mechanism that requires an accessory resolvase and resolution site, the absence of a resolvase gene means the element cannot transpose autonomously; classification as an IS is therefore unsupported.\nThis statement is based on a false premise. The DDE catalytic motif is characteristic of transposases that use a \"cut-and-paste\" mechanism, which is conservative, not replicative. Replicative transposition, found in elements like the Tn$3$ family, uses transposases of the serine recombinase family and requires a resolvase for a secondary reaction. DDE transposases do not require a resolvase. The element is therefore autonomous.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. A miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE). The presence of short inverted repeats and $9$ base pair direct repeats indicates a nonautonomous element; the ORF is vestigial and not part of the mobile unit.\nThis statement is incorrect. A MITE is by definition a nonautonomous element that lacks a transposase gene. This element contains a $1053$ $bp$ ORF predicted to encode a complete transposase with both catalytic and DNA-binding domains. There is no evidence to suggest the ORF is \"vestigial\". The presence of a functional transposase gene makes this an autonomous element, not a MITE.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2862692"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond the basic structure of 'cut-and-paste' elements, this exercise delves into the elegant, multi-step mechanism of replicative transposition, exemplified by the Tn3 family.

The target plasmid $P_T$ is $4.8\\,\\mathrm{kb}$. Transposition events are selected by requiring both the donor-encoded transposon resistance and the target plasmid resistance to be present in the same cell, and plasmid Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) is then analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.\n\nFundamental background (not the target conclusion): In replicative transposition, the transposase catalyzes strand transfer to create a cointegrate joining donor and target replicons. The cointegrate contains duplicated copies of the transposon flanking the donor–target junctions and is resolved to two separate replicons by a site-specific recombination event at the res site, catalyzed by the transposon-encoded resolvase. In the absence of resolvase, homologous recombination mediated by the host recombination protein A (RecA) can, in principle, recombine between the duplicated transposon copies and separate the replicons, but this pathway is typically less efficient than resolvase-mediated resolution. Target site duplications generated during transposition have a characteristic length dictated by the transposase and are not determined by the resolvase.\n\nYou construct a strain carrying a donor plasmid in which the resolvase gene ($tnpR$) is precisely deleted ($\\Delta tnpR$), leaving the transposase gene intact. You perform the standard mating or transformation into either a RecA-deficient host ($recA^{-}$) or a RecA-proficient host ($recA^{+}$), and select for cells carrying both the target plasmid marker and the transposon marker.

There are no subjective or ambiguous statements. The sizes and genetic statuses are clearly defined.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is a valid problem. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the consequences of deleting the resolvase gene ($tnpR$) in the context of replicative transposition, and how this is affected by the host's homologous recombination capacity (RecA status).\n\n**1. Cointegrate Formation and Structure**\nReplicative transposition begins when the transposase from the donor plasmid $P_D$ acts on the ends of the transposon $TnX$ and a target site on the target plasmid $P_T$. This process involves nicking and strand transfer, followed by DNA synthesis that replicates the transposon. The result is a single, large, circular molecule called a cointegrate.\n\nThe cointegrate contains the entire sequence of the donor plasmid backbone, the entire sequence of the target plasmid, and two copies of the transposon.\nThe size of the donor plasmid backbone is $|P_D| - |TnX| = 12.2\\,\\mathrm{kb} - 5.2\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 7.0\\,\\mathrm{kb}$.\nThe size of the target plasmid is $|P_T| = 4.8\\,\\mathrm{kb}$.\nThe total size of the cointegrate is therefore:\n$$(\\text{Donor backbone}) + (\\text{Target plasmid}) + 2 \\times (\\text{Transposon})$$\n$$ \\text{Size}_{\\text{cointegrate}} = (7.0\\,\\mathrm{kb}) + (4.8\\,\\mathrm{kb}) + 2 \\times (5.2\\,\\mathrm{kb}) = 11.8\\,\\mathrm{kb} + 10.4\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 22.2\\,\\mathrm{kb} $$\nThis calculation can be simplified to $|P_D| + |P_T| + |TnX|$. Using the given values:\n$$ \\text{Size}_{\\text{cointegrate}} = 12.2\\,\\mathrm{kb} + 4.8\\,\\mathrm{kb} + 5.2\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 22.2\\,\\mathrm{kb} $$\nThis large plasmid now carries the markers from both original plasmids and will thus be selected.\n\n**2. Cointegrate Resolution**\nThe cointegrate is an intermediate. It must be resolved into two separate plasmids to complete the transposition event. The cointegrate structure is [Donor backbone] -- [TnX] -- [Target plasmid] -- [TnX] --. The two copies of $TnX$ are in the same orientation.\n- **Resolvase Pathway:** The $tnpR$ gene product, resolvase, catalyzes a site-specific recombination between the two `res` sites located within the transposon copies. This is the primary, efficient pathway. It yields the original donor plasmid $P_D$ ($12.2\\,\\mathrm{kb}$) and the target plasmid now containing one copy of the transposon, $P_T'$ (size $|P_T| + |TnX| = 4.8\\,\\mathrm{kb} + 5.2\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{kb}$).\n- **RecA Pathway:** In the absence of resolvase, the host's general homologous recombination system, mediated by RecA, can recombine the two identical copies of $TnX$. This is less efficient than the specialized resolvase system but can still resolve the cointegrate, yielding the same final products.\n\n**3. Analysis of Experimental Conditions**\n- **Case 1: $\\Delta tnpR\\;recA^{-}$ background.** In this strain, both the specialized resolvase pathway ($\\Delta tnpR$) and the general homologous recombination pathway ($recA^{-}$) for resolution are disabled. Transposition will proceed to the cointegrate stage, forming the $22.2\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ plasmid. However, this cointegrate cannot be resolved. The selected clones (requiring both resistance markers) will therefore predominantly contain this large, stable cointegrate. The simple insertion product ($10.0\\,\\mathrm{kb}$) will not be formed.\n\n- **Case 2: $\\Delta tnpR\\;recA^{+}$ background.** In this strain, the resolvase pathway is disabled, but the homologous recombination pathway is active ($recA^{+}$). Cointegrates will form as before. The RecA protein can then act on the duplicated $TnX$ sequences to resolve the cointegrate. As stated in the problem, this pathway is less efficient. Consequently, we expect to observe a mixture of products: some clones will contain the unresolved $22.2\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ cointegrate, while others will contain the resolved products, which include the $10.0\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ target plasmid with the transposon insertion. The frequency of obtaining this resolved $10.0\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ product will be lower than in a wild-type ($tnpR^{+}$) situation where resolution is efficient.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In the $\\Delta tnpR\\;recA^{-}$ background, the predominant product among double-resistant clones will be an unresolved cointegrate of size approximately $|P_D| + |P_T| + |TnX| \\approx 12.2\\,\\mathrm{kb} + 4.8\\,\\mathrm{kb} + 5.2\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 22.2\\,\\mathrm{kb}$, yielding a new large band; a simple $+5.2\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ shift of $P_T$ to approximately $10.0\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ will be rare or absent.**\nThis statement directly follows from our analysis of Case 1. With both resolution pathways blocked, the transposition process stalls at the cointegrate intermediate. The size calculation is correct. The resolved product of size $10.0\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ cannot be formed.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Deletion of $tnpR$ shortens the target-site duplication length (for example, from $5\\,\\mathrm{bp}$ to $0\\,\\mathrm{bp}$), so insertions become too small to detect as plasmid size shifts.**\nThe problem background explicitly states, \"Target site duplications ... are not determined by the resolvase.\" They are a product of the transposase-catalyzed strand transfer reaction. The resolvase acts later. Therefore, deleting $tnpR$ has no effect on the target site duplication. The statement is fundamentally incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Deletion of $tnpR$ converts the mechanism to a conservative “cut-and-paste” pathway, so the donor plasmid will lose $5.2\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ and the target plasmid will gain $5.2\\,\\mathrm{kb}$, producing reciprocal size shifts.**\nThe $TnX$ transposon is specified as a \"Tn3-family replicative transposon.\" The choice between replicative and conservative (cut-and-paste) transposition is intrinsic to the transposase and the transposon itself. Deleting the resolvase gene, which is involved in a separate, subsequent step, does not alter the initial transposition mechanism. Transposition will still be replicative, proceeding via a cointegrate.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. In the $\\Delta tnpR\\;recA^{+}$ background, two classes of products will be detected: large cointegrates at about $22.2\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ and, at reduced frequency relative to wild type, simple target insertions at approximately $|P_T| + |TnX| \\approx 10.0\\,\\mathrm{kb}$, because homologous recombination between the duplicated $TnX$ copies can resolve cointegrates inefficiently without resolvase.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with our analysis of Case 2. Cointegrates ($22.2\\,\\mathrm{kb}$) form and accumulate because the primary resolvase pathway is absent. The secondary, less efficient RecA-mediated pathway allows some resolution to occur, producing the simple insertion product ($10.0\\,\\mathrm{kb}$). The inefficiency explains why both species are observed and why simple insertions are at a reduced frequency.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. Loss of resolvase function abolishes transposition, so only unmodified $P_D$ and $P_T$ are recovered.**\nThis is incorrect. Transposition is initiated by the transposase, which is stated to be intact. Resolvase is required for the *resolution* of the transposition intermediate, not its formation. Transposition will occur, leading to the formation of cointegrates. Therefore, modified plasmids will be recovered.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**F. Because resolvase normally regulates transcription by binding the res site and repressing the transposase promoter, a $\\Delta tnpR$ donor tends to increase the initial rate of cointegrate formation; however, assays that score only simple $P_T$ size shifts will underestimate transposition in $\\Delta tnpR$ strains due to accumulation of unresolved cointegrates that migrate as a much larger species around $22.2\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ rather than as a $+5.2\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ shift of $P_T$.**\nThis statement introduces a known regulatory role of TnpR in the Tn3 system. TnpR represses its own transcription and that of the transposase ($tnpA$). Deleting $tnpR$ relieves this repression, leading to higher levels of transposase and thus a higher frequency of cointegrate formation. The second part of the statement correctly points out an important experimental consequence: if one's assay is designed to detect only the final resolved product (the $10.0\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ plasmid), one would miss all the transposition events trapped at the cointegrate stage ($22.2\\,\\mathrm{kb}$). This would lead to an underestimation of the true transposition frequency, which is mechanistically increased. This is a subtle but correct point.\n**Verdict: Correct**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ADF}$$", "id": "2862678"}, {"introduction": "In the age of genomics, identifying new transposable elements requires powerful computational tools.

The solution must be a complete program that implements the detection algorithm and computes a conservative analytical false discovery rate using a principled statistical model of nucleotide independence.\n\nTask context, definitions, and assumptions:\n\n- A Terminal Inverted Repeat is defined as a pair of DNA segments flanking an element, one on the left side and one on the right side, such that one segment is the reverse complement of the other, up to a bounded number of mismatches. A Target Site Duplication is defined as an identical short sequence on the host genome immediately adjacent to the outer sides of the two TIRs, generated upon element insertion.

For each pair, count the number of reverse-complement matches across the $L$ aligned positions and the number of mismatches $e = L - M$.\n  - Among all pairs with $e \\le e_{\\max}$, select the single best candidate that maximizes $M$ (equivalently minimizes $e$).

If no such $\\ell \\ge \\ell_{\\min}$ exists, set $\\ell = 0$ and treat the TSD contribution as absent.\n- Statistical modeling from foundational principles:\n  - Let $r$ denote the per-position probability that two independent nucleotides are reverse-complement matches under the i.i.d. background. Derive $r$ from $\\left(f_A, f_C, f_G, f_T\\right)$ using only independence and complementarity rules.\n  - Under independence across positions, the number of reverse-complement matches $K$ across $L$ aligned positions follows a distribution you must derive.

The local probability for an exact TSD of length $\\ell$ is $p_{\\text{TSD,local}}$, derived from $s$ and $\\ell$.\n  - Combine TIR and TSD evidence into a single local probability $p_{\\text{local}}$ for the observed or more extreme event, using a principled combination justified by independence assumptions you specify. If $\\ell = 0$, omit TSD evidence by taking $p_{\\text{local}} = p_{\\text{TIR,local}}$.\n  - Let $m_{\\text{pairs}}$ be the total number of TIR pair comparisons performed across all $L \\in \\left[L_{\\min}, L_{\\max}\\right]$. You must compute\n    $$m_{\\text{pairs}} = \\sum_{L=L_{\\min}}^{L_{\\max}} \\left(\\max\\left(0, w_L - L + 1\\right)\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\max\\left(0, w_R - L + 1\\right)\\right).$$\n    Let $m_{\\text{tsd}}$ be the number of TSD lengths tested if $\\ell \\ge \\ell_{\\min}$, that is $m_{\\text{tsd}} = \\ell_{\\max} - \\ell_{\\min} + 1$, else $m_{\\text{tsd}} = 1$. Use a conservative Bonferroni adjustment with $m = m_{\\text{pairs}} \\cdot m_{\\text{tsd}}$ to produce the analytical false discovery estimate $\\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}} = \\min\\left(1, m \\cdot p_{\\text{local}}\\right)$ for the single best candidate.

For example, an output line should look like \"[0.123456,0.000001,1.000000,0.532100]\".", "solution": "The problem statement is a valid, well-posed computational biology task. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of genetics and biostatistics, providing a clear and objective set of requirements for identifying putative transposable elements and assessing their statistical significance. All necessary parameters and data are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or logical flaws. We will now proceed with a solution derived from first principles.\n\nThe core of the task is to distinguish a true biological signal—a transposable element marked by Terminal Inverted Repeats (TIRs) and Target Site Duplications (TSDs)—from random sequence artifacts. This is achieved by constructing a null hypothesis, calculating the probability of observing the evidence under this null, and adjusting this probability to account for the extensive search performed.\n\n**1. Statistical Framework: The Null Model**\n\nWe begin by formalizing the null hypothesis: the DNA sequence is a random sequence generated from an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) process, where each nucleotide at each position is drawn independently from the set $\\{A, C, G, T\\}$ with fixed background frequencies $(f_A, f_C, f_G, f_T)$, such that $\\sum_{i \\in \\{A,C,G,T\\}} f_i = 1$.\n\nUnder this model, we can derive the probabilities of fundamental matching events between two independently drawn nucleotides, $N_1$ and $N_2$.\n\n- **Probability of a Reverse-Complement Match ($r$)**: A reverse-complement match occurs if the pair $(N_1, N_2)$ is one of $(A, T)$, $(T, A)$, $(C, G)$, or $(G, C)$. Due to independence, the total probability, $r$, is the sum of the probabilities of these disjoint events:\n$$r = P(N_1=A, N_2=T) + P(N_1=T, N_2=A) + P(N_1=C, N_2=G) + P(N_1=G, N_2=C)$$\n$$r = f_A f_T + f_T f_A + f_C f_G + f_G f_C = 2(f_A f_T + f_C f_G)$$\n\n- **Probability of an Identical Match ($s$)**: An identical match occurs if $N_1$ and $N_2$ are the same nucleotide. The probability, $s$, is:\n$$s = P(N_1=A, N_2=A) + P(N_1=C, N_2=C) + P(N_1=G, N_2=G) + P(N_1=T, N_2=T)$$\n$$s = f_A^2 + f_C^2 + f_G^2 + f_T^2$$\n\nThese two probabilities, $r$ and $s$, are the foundational parameters for our statistical tests.\n\n**2. Local Probability of TIR Evidence ($p_{\\text{TIR,local}}$)**\n\nA candidate TIR pair consists of two sequences of length $L$. Under the null hypothesis, these are treated as two independent random sequences. The comparison of a left segment with the reverse complement of a right segment is equivalent to comparing two independent random sequences of length $L$ for reverse complementarity at each position.\n\nEach of the $L$ positions represents an independent Bernoulli trial, where \"success\" is a reverse-complement match with probability $r$. The total number of matches, $K$, in $L$ positions therefore follows a Binomial distribution: $K \\sim B(L, r)$.\n\nThe problem requires selecting the \"best\" candidate by maximizing the number of matches, $M$. The statistical significance of this best candidate is assessed by calculating the probability of observing a result at least as \"extreme\" (i.e., at least as good). This corresponds to the tail probability $\\Pr(K \\ge M)$. This is the local p-value for the TIR evidence:\n$$p_{\\text{TIR,local}} = \\Pr(K \\ge M | L, r) = \\sum_{k=M}^{L} \\binom{L}{k} r^k (1-r)^{L-k}$$\n\n**3. Local Probability of TSD Evidence and Combined Probability ($p_{\\text{local}}$)**\n\nA TSD is an exact duplication of a short sequence. We search for the longest exact TSD of length $\\ell$ in the range $[\\ell_{\\min}, \\ell_{\\max}]$. Under the i.i.d. null model, the regions flanking the TIRs are independent of the TIRs themselves and of each other. Therefore, the TIR and TSD events are statistically independent.\n\nThe local probability of observing an exact TSD of length $\\ell$ between two specific, non-overlapping regions is the probability of $\\ell$ consecutive identical matches. Due to independence between nucleotide positions, this probability is $s^\\ell$. This represents the \"evidence\" from the TSD.\n\nTo combine the evidence from the TIR and TSD, we calculate the joint probability of the compound event under the null hypothesis. Since the events are independent, the joint probability is the product of their individual probabilities. If a TSD of length $\\ell \\ge \\ell_{\\min}$ is found for the best TIR candidate (which had $M$ matches over length $L$), the combined local probability is:\n$$p_{\\text{local}} = p_{\\text{TIR,local}} \\cdot s^{\\ell}$$\nIf no TSD of length at least $\\ell_{\\min}$ is found, we set $\\ell=0$, and the TSD provides no additional evidence. In this case, the local probability is simply that of the TIR:\n$$p_{\\text{local}} = p_{\\text{TIR,local}}$$\n\n**4. Multiple Hypothesis Correction and the Final $\\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}}$**\n\nThe search for the best candidate involves a large number of comparisons. We test many potential TIR pairs across different lengths and starting positions. This constitutes a multiple hypothesis testing problem, and the resulting $p_{\\text{local}}$ must be corrected to control for the inflated probability of finding a seemingly significant result by chance.\n\nWe use the Bonferroni correction, a conservative method to control the family-wise error rate (FWER), which provides an upper bound on the false discovery rate. The correction factor, $m$, is the total number of tests performed.\n\n- **Number of TIR pair tests ($m_{\\text{pairs}}$)**: For each length $L \\in [L_{\\min}, L_{\\max}]$, there are $\\max(0, w_L - L + 1)$ possible start positions in the left window of length $w_L$ and $\\max(0, w_R - L + 1)$ in the right window of length $w_R$. The total number of TIR pairs tested is:\n$$m_{\\text{pairs}} = \\sum_{L=L_{\\min}}^{L_{\\max}} \\left(\\max\\left(0, w_L - L + 1\\right)\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\max\\left(0, w_R - L + 1\\right)\\right)$$\n\n- **Number of TSD tests ($m_{\\text{tsd}}$)**: If a qualifying TSD is found, the search has implicitly tested for all lengths in the range $[\\ell_{\\min}, \\ell_{\\max}]$. The number of TSD lengths tested is $m_{\\text{tsd}} = \\ell_{\\max} - \\ell_{\\min} + 1$. If no valid TSD is found, a single composite hypothesis (that no TSD exists) has been tested, so we take $m_{\\text{tsd}} = 1$.\n\nThe total number of hypotheses is $m = m_{\\text{pairs}} \\cdot m_{\\text{tsd}}$. The Bonferroni-corrected p-value, which we use as the analytical false discovery rate estimate $\\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}}$, is:\n$$\\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}} = \\min\\left(1, m \\cdot p_{\\text{local}}\\right)$$\n\nIf the initial search finds no TIR candidate satisfying the maximum error constraint ($e \\le e_{\\max}$), or if the search space is empty ($m_{\\text{pairs}} = 0$), no statistically significant call can be made, and we set $\\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}} = 1$.\n\n**5. Algorithmic Implementation**\n\nThe programmatic solution implements this logic directly. It first computes the necessary search window parameters ($w_L, w_R$) and statistical parameters ($r, s$). It then performs an exhaustive search for the best TIR candidate by iterating through all specified lengths $L$ and all possible start positions in the left and right windows. The best candidate is selected based on the strict hierarchical criteria: minimum mismatches $e$, maximum length $L$, and lexicographically smallest start positions $(i_L, j_R)$.\n\nOnce the best TIR is identified, a search for the longest TSD is conducted in the specified flanking regions and length range. With the best TIR and TSD identified, the local probabilities are calculated using the derived formulas, with the binomial tail probability computed efficiently. Finally, the multiple testing correction factor $m$ is computed, and the final $\\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}}$ is determined. This procedure is applied independently to each test case provided.", "answer": "[0.000002,1.000000,0.000453,0.000001]", "id": "2862714"}]}
