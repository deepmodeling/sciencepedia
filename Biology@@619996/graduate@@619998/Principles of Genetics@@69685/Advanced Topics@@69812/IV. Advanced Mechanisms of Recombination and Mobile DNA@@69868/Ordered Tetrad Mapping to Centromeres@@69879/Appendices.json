The order of spores in each ascus reflects the sequence of meiotic divisions.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in classical genetics that is internally consistent and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We will proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe task is to determine the map distance between a genetic locus $A$ and its centromere using ordered tetrad analysis. The fundamental principle is that the segregation pattern of alleles in a meiotic tetrad reveals whether a crossover event has occurred between the gene locus and the centromere.\n\nIn a heterozygous diploid cell with alleles $A$ and $a$, the chromosomes replicate before meiosis, resulting in a structure with four chromatids (a bivalent), two carrying allele $A$ and two carrying allele $a$.\n\nCase $1$: No Crossover\nIf no crossover occurs between the gene locus and the centromere, the homologous centromeres separate during anaphase I. This pulls all chromatids with allele $A$ to one pole and all chromatids with allele $a$ to the other. Sister chromatids then separate during meiosis II. The resulting four meiotic products (which then divide mitotically to form eight spores in the ascus) are arranged such that the first four spores have one genotype (e.g., $A$) and the last four have the other (e.g., $a$). This is the $4{:}4$ contiguous arrangement defined as first-division segregation (FDS). An FDS pattern signifies the absence of a crossover between the gene and the centromere.\n\nCase $2$: Single Crossover\nIf a single crossover occurs between the gene locus and the centromere, the event involves only two of the four chromatids. At anaphase I, homologous centromeres separate. However, because of the crossover, each separating homologous chromosome now carries one chromatid with allele $A$ and one with allele $a$. Therefore, both alleles $A$ and $a$ are segregated to both poles of the meiosis I spindle. The alleles do not segregate from each other until anaphase II, when sister chromatids separate. This leads to non-contiguous arrangements of spores, such as $2{:}2{:}2{:}2$ or $2{:}4{:}2$. These are classified as second-division segregation (SDS) patterns. An SDS pattern is the definitive marker of a crossover event between the gene and the centromere.\n\nThe problem provides the following data:\nTotal number of asci, $N = 1,500$.\nNumber of FDS asci, $n_{\\text{FDS}} = 913$.\nNumber of SDS asci, $n_{\\text{SDS}} = 587$.\nWe verify that $n_{\\text{FDS}} + n_{\\text{SDS}} = 913 + 587 = 1,500 = N$. The data is consistent.\n\nFirst, we compute the observed frequency of SDS asci, $f_{\\text{SDS}}$.\n$$f_{\\text{SDS}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{SDS}}}{N} = \\frac{587}{1,500}$$\n\nNow, we must derive the relationship between $f_{\\text{SDS}}$ and the recombination frequency, $RF$. The recombination frequency is defined as the proportion of recombinant meiotic products (spores) relative to the total number of meiotic products.\n$$RF = \\frac{\\text{Number of recombinant meiotic products}}{\\text{Total number of meiotic products}}$$\nThe map distance in centimorgans (cM) is then defined as $d = 100 \\times RF$.\n\nAn FDS ascus results from a meiosis with no crossover between the gene and the centromere. Therefore, it contains zero recombinant meiotic products.\nAn SDS ascus results from a meiosis with a single crossover between the gene and the centromere. This crossover event involves two of the four chromatids at the four-strand stage. Consequently, of the four meiotic products, two are recombinant and two are parental (non-recombinant).\n\nThe justification for the factor relating $f_{\\text{SDS}}$ and $RF$ is as follows: The frequency of SDS asci ($f_{\\text{SDS}}$) is the frequency of meiotic *events* that involve a crossover between the gene and the centromere. However, each such *event* produces a tetrad in which only *half* of the products are recombinant. Thus, the frequency of recombinant *products* ($RF$) is exactly half the frequency of the meiotic *events* that generated them.\n\nWe can formalize this. The total number of meiotic products is $4 \\times N$. The number of recombinant products is found only in SDS asci, with each SDS ascus containing $2$ recombinant products.\nNumber of recombinant meiotic products = $2 \\times n_{\\text{SDS}}$.\nTotal number of meiotic products = $4 \\times N$.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency $RF$ is:\n$$RF = \\frac{2 \\times n_{\\text{SDS}}}{4 \\times N} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{n_{\\text{SDS}}}{N}$$\nSubstituting the definition of $f_{\\text{SDS}}$, we obtain the direct relationship:\n$$RF = \\frac{1}{2} f_{\\text{SDS}}$$\nThis derived relationship connecting the observed frequency of SDS asci to the recombination fraction is a fundamental result of ordered tetrad analysis.\n\nWe now use this formula to compute the map distance.\nFirst, we calculate the recombination frequency using the provided data:\n$$RF = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{587}{1,500} = \\frac{587}{3,000}$$\nThe map distance, $d$, in centimorgans (cM) is $100$ times the recombination frequency.\n$$d = 100 \\times RF = 100 \\times \\frac{587}{3,000} = \\frac{587}{30}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value and round to $4$ significant figures as requested.\n$$d = \\frac{587}{30} \\approx 19.5666... \\text{ cM}$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$d \\approx 19.57 \\text{ cM}$$\nThe computed SDS frequency is $f_{\\text{SDS}} = \\frac{587}{1,500} \\approx 0.3913$. The map distance is half of this frequency, expressed as a percentage: $d = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.3913 \\times 100 \\approx 19.57$ cM.

Assume the following fundamental base:\n- Crossovers along a chromosomal interval follow a Poisson process with no crossover interference (the Haldane model).\n- One Morgan corresponds to an average of one crossover per chromatid per meiosis along that interval.\n- Each crossover event involves exactly two chromatids (no chromatid interference).\n\nLet $f_{\\text{SDS}}$ denote the observed fraction of tetrads showing second-division segregation for a locus relative to its centromere.

Let $d$ be the genetic map distance between the locus and its centromere, expressed in Morgans ($M$). The distance in centiMorgans ($cM$) is $d_{\\text{cM}} = 100d$. Let $\\mu$ be the mean number of crossovers occurring in this gene-centromere interval per meiosis.\n\nThe problem provides three fundamental principles:\n1.  A tetrad shows second-division segregation if and only if at least one crossover ($k \\ge 1$) occurs between the centromere and the locus.\n2.  Crossovers follow a Poisson process with mean $\\mu$. The probability of observing $k$ crossovers is given by $P(k) = \\frac{e^{-\\mu}\\mu^k}{k!}$.\n3.  The map distance in Morgans, $d$, is defined as the average number of crossovers per chromatid per meiosis. In a meiotic bivalent with four chromatids, a mean of $\\mu$ crossovers per meiosis involves an average of $2\\mu$ chromatid strands (since each crossover involves two of the four chromatids, and there is no chromatid interference). Therefore, the average number of crossovers per chromatid is $\\frac{2\\mu}{4} = \\frac{\\mu}{2}$. This establishes the crucial relationship between map distance and the mean crossover frequency:\n$$d = \\frac{\\mu}{2}$$\n\nFirst, we derive the naive small-distance approximation. For small distances, the mean number of crossovers $\\mu$ is very small ($\\mu \\ll 1$). The probability of more than one crossover is negligible.\nThe fraction of SDS tetrads is the probability of one or more crossovers:\n$$f_{\\text{SDS}} = P(k \\ge 1) = 1 - P(k=0) = 1 - e^{-\\mu}$$\nFor small $\\mu$, we can use the Taylor series expansion of the exponential function, $e^x \\approx 1 + x$ for $|x| \\ll 1$.\n$$f_{\\text{SDS}} = 1 - (1 - \\mu) = \\mu$$\nThis approximation, $f_{\\text{SDS}} \\approx \\mu$, is valid only when $P(k \\ge 2)$ is negligible.\nSubstituting this into the distance relationship $d = \\frac{\\mu}{2}$, we obtain the small-distance approximation for distance in Morgans:\n$$d_{\\text{naive}} \\approx \\frac{f_{\\text{SDS}}}{2}$$\nIn centiMorgans, this becomes:\n$$d_{\\text{cM, naive}} \\approx 100 \\times \\frac{f_{\\text{SDS}}}{2} = 50 f_{\\text{SDS}}$$\n\nNext, we derive the Poisson-corrected expression, which is valid for any distance.

This is because an SDS ascus results from a crossover between the gene and the centromere, and in such an ascus, half of the spores are recombinant and half are parental.\n\nThe true gene-centromere distance, $d$, is based on the true frequency of SDS asci, which is given as $f_{\\text{SDS}}^{\\ast}$.\n$$d = \\frac{1}{2} f_{\\text{SDS}}^{\\ast}$$\n\nThe scorer, however, does not measure $f_{\\text{SDS}}^{\\ast}$.
