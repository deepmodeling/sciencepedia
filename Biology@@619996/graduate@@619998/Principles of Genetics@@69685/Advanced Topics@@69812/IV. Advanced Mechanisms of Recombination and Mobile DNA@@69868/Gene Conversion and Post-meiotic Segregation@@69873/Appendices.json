This means the probability of observing PMS, conditional on a mismatch having formed, is equal to the probability that this mismatch goes unrepaired.\n$$ P(E_{\\text{PMS}} | E_{\\text{MM}}) = P(\\text{unrepaired} | E_{\\text{MM}}) = q $$\n\nFurthermore, the problem states that in the absence of a mismatch, there is no PMS.

The sample space of all meioses can be partitioned into two mutually exclusive events: either a mismatch is formed ($E_{\\text{MM}}$) or it is not ($E_{\\text{MM}}^c$).

It describes a standard problem in statistical inference applied to genetics. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe number of observed $3:1$ tetrads, denoted by the random variable $K$, is assumed to follow a Binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$. The probability mass function is given by:\n$$P(K=k | n,p) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$\nwhere $n=150$ is the number of independent trials (asci) and $p$ is the unknown probability of a gene conversion event leading to a $3:1$ segregation pattern. The observed outcome is $k=0$.\n\nFirst, we derive the maximum-likelihood estimate (MLE) of $p$, denoted as $\\hat{p}$. The likelihood function $L(p;k)$ is proportional to the probability mass function:\n$$L(p;k) \\propto p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$\nIt is more convenient to work with the log-likelihood function, $\\ell(p;k) = \\ln(L(p;k))$:\n$$\\ell(p;k) = k \\ln(p) + (n-k) \\ln(1-p) + C$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant independent of $p$. The MLE is found by maximizing $\\ell(p;k)$ with respect to $p$. The derivative of the log-likelihood is:\n$$\\frac{d\\ell}{dp} = \\frac{k}{p} - \\frac{n-k}{1-p}$$\nFor the given data, $n=150$ and $k=0$, the log-likelihood function simplifies to:\n$$\\ell(p;0) = 150 \\ln(1-p) + C$$\nThe derivative is:\n$$\\frac{d\\ell}{dp} = -\\frac{150}{1-p}$$\nFor $p \\in [0,1)$, this derivative is always negative. This indicates that the likelihood function is a strictly decreasing function of $p$. Therefore, the function is maximized at the lowest possible value in the domain of $p$, which is $p=0$.\nThus, the maximum-likelihood estimate is:\n$$\\hat{p} = 0$$\n\nSecond, we construct the exact $95\\%$ two-sided confidence interval for $p$ using the Clopper-Pearson method. This method is based on inverting the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Binomial distribution. The confidence level is $1-\\alpha = 0.95$, which implies $\\alpha = 0.05$ and $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$. The confidence interval $[p_L, p_U]$ is defined by the set of all values $p_0$ such that the null hypothesis $H_0: p=p_0$ is not rejected when tested against the observed data $k=0$.\n\nThe lower confidence limit, $p_L$, is the value of $p$ that solves the equation:\n$$P(K \\ge k | p=p_L) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}$$\nFor the observed value $k=0$, this equation becomes $P(K \\ge 0 | p=p_L) = \\alpha/2$. Since $P(K \\ge 0) = 1$ for any $p>0$, the equation $1 = 0.025$ has no solution. By definition of the Clopper-Pearson interval for the boundary case $k=0$, the lower limit is set to the absolute boundary of the parameter space.\n$$p_L = 0$$\n\nThe upper confidence limit, $p_U$, is the value of $p$ that solves the equation:\n$$P(K \\le k | p=p_U) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}$$\nThis is equivalent to finding the value $p_U$ for which the value of the binomial CDF at $k$ is equal to $\\alpha/2$. For the observed value $k=0$, the equation is:\n$$P(K \\le 0 | p=p_U) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}$$\nThe event $K \\le 0$ consists of only one outcome, $K=0$. Therefore:\n$$P(K=0 | p=p_U) = \\binom{n}{0} p_U^0 (1-p_U)^{n-0} = (1-p_U)^n$$\nWe set this equal to $\\alpha/2$ and solve for $p_U$:\n$$(1-p_U)^n = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}$$\nSubstituting $n=150$ and $\\alpha=0.05$:\n$$(1-p_U)^{150} = \\frac{0.05}{2} = 0.025$$\nTaking the $150$-th root of both sides:\n$$1-p_U = (0.025)^{\\frac{1}{150}}$$\nSolving for $p_U$:\n$$p_U = 1 - (0.025)^{\\frac{1}{150}}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the upper bound.\n\nIn summary, for the data $n=150$ and $k=0$:\n1.

During meiotic recombination, heteroduplex DNA can form across such sites, and subsequent mismatch repair can result in non-Mendelian segregation. Define the per-event guanine/cytosine bias parameter $b$ as the probability that, conditional on producing a fully repaired non-Mendelian outcome at one such site, the mismatch is resolved in favor of the guanine/cytosine allele rather than the adenine/thymine allele. In tetrad analysis, a fully repaired non-Mendelian outcome appears as a $3{:}1$ segregation at the site, whereas lack of repair can yield $5{:}3$ or $3{:}5$ post-meiotic segregation (Post-Meiotic Segregation, PMS). Assume that orientation of heteroduplex strands with respect to parental alleles is symmetric, and that we condition on events that yield $3{:}1$ outcomes at informative A/T versus G/C sites, so that $b$ is identifiable from the fraction of $3{:}1$ events that favor guanine/cytosine.\n\nIn practice, classification of a $3{:}1$ event into “guanine/cytosine-favoring” (three spores carry the guanine/cytosine allele and one carries the adenine/thymine allele) or “adenine/thymine-favoring” is subject to a small, symmetric scoring error: with probability $\\epsilon$ a true guanine/cytosine-favoring event is recorded as adenine/thymine-favoring, and with the same probability $\\epsilon$ a true adenine/thymine-favoring event is recorded as guanine/cytosine-favoring.

The statistical framework—a binomial sampling model with a layer of misclassification—is a standard and well-posed problem in mathematical statistics. The language used is objective and precise. All necessary parameters ($n$, $k$, $\\epsilon$) are provided, and there are no internal contradictions. The numerical values are plausible for a biological experiment. The problem asks for the derivation of a maximum likelihood estimator, which is a well-defined mathematical objective that admits a unique solution under these conditions. The problem is not trivial, as it requires correction for a known error source, which is a common task in experimental science.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to find the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the parameter $b$. Let us first define the probability of observing a G/C-favoring record.\nLet $T_G$ be the event that a true $3{:}1$ segregation is G/C-favoring. The problem states that the probability of this event is $b$.\n$$P(T_G) = b$$\nConsequently, the event $T_A$ that a true $3{:}1$ segregation is adenine/thymine (A/T)-favoring has probability:\n$$P(T_A) = 1 - b$$\nLet $R_G$ be the event that a segregation is *recorded* as G/C-favoring. We are given the symmetric misclassification probabilities:\n$P(\\text{recorded as A/T} | T_G) = \\epsilon$\n$P(\\text{recorded as G/C} | T_A) = \\epsilon$\n\nFrom these, we can state the probabilities of correct classification:\n$P(R_G | T_G) = 1 - P(\\text{recorded as A/T} | T_G) = 1 - \\epsilon$\n$P(\\text{recorded as A/T} | T_A) = 1 - P(R_G | T_A) = 1 - \\epsilon$\n\nLet $p$ be the overall probability of an event being recorded as G/C-favoring. We can calculate $p$ using the law of total probability:\n$$p = P(R_G) = P(R_G|T_G)P(T_G) + P(R_G|T_A)P(T_A)$$\nSubstituting the known values and parameters:\n$$p = (1 - \\epsilon)b + \\epsilon(1 - b)$$\n$$p = b - b\\epsilon + \\epsilon - b\\epsilon$$\n$$p = b(1 - 2\\epsilon) + \\epsilon$$\nThis expression relates the true underlying bias $b$ to the observable probability $p$ of a G/C-favoring record.\n\nThe data consist of $n$ independent trials, where $k$ are recorded as G/C-favoring. This follows a binomial distribution. The probability of observing exactly $k$ such records in $n$ trials is given by:\n$$P(k | n, p) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$\nThe likelihood function $L(b; k, n, \\epsilon)$ is this probability viewed as a function of the parameter $b$. We can ignore the constant binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k}$ as it does not affect the location of the maximum.\n$$L(b) \\propto p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $p$ in terms of $b$ and $\\epsilon$:\n$$L(b) \\propto [b(1 - 2\\epsilon) + \\epsilon]^k [1 - (b(1 - 2\\epsilon) + \\epsilon)]^{n-k}$$\n$$L(b) \\propto [b(1 - 2\\epsilon) + \\epsilon]^k [1 - \\epsilon - b(1 - 2\\epsilon)]^{n-k}$$\nTo find the value of $b$ that maximizes this function, it is computationally simpler to maximize the log-likelihood function, $\\ell(b) = \\ln L(b)$.\n$$\\ell(b) = k \\ln[b(1 - 2\\epsilon) + \\epsilon] + (n-k) \\ln[1 - \\epsilon - b(1 - 2\\epsilon)] + C$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant term.
