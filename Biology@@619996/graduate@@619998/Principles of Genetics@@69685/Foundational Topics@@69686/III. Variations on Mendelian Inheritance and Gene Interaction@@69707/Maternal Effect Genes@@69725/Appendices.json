This first exercise [@problem_id:1501971] uses the classic example of shell coiling in the snail *Lymnaea peregra* to test your understanding of this core principle. Your task is to apply the definition of maternal effect directly to predict the phenotypes of offspring from a mother of a known genotype.", "problem": "In the pond snail, *Lymnaea peregra*, the direction of shell coiling is a classic example of a trait determined by a maternal effect gene. The allele for a right-handed (dextral) shell, denoted as $D$, is dominant over the allele for a left-handed (sinistral) shell, denoted as $d$. The key principle of this mode of inheritance is that the phenotype of an individual snail for this trait is not determined by its own genotype, but rather by the genotype of its mother. The gene products supplied by the mother to the egg before fertilization dictate the orientation of the mitotic spindle in the first cleavage division, thereby setting the coiling direction for the developing offspring.\n\nConsider a hermaphroditic snail that is heterozygous ($D/d$) for the coiling gene. This snail undergoes self-fertilization, producing a new generation of offspring.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the shell phenotypes of these immediate offspring?\n\nA. All offspring will have dextral shells.\n\nB. All offspring will have sinistral shells.\n\nC. 3/4 of the offspring will have dextral shells and 1/4 will have sinistral shells.\n\nD. 1/4 of the offspring will have dextral shells and 3/4 will have sinistral shells.\n\nE. 1/2 of the offspring will have dextral shells and 1/2 will have sinistral shells.\n\nF. The phenotypes cannot be determined from the information given.", "solution": "The key genetic principle is a maternal effect: the phenotype of an offspring for shell coiling depends on the genotype of its mother, not on the offspring’s own genotype. Let the maternal genotype be denoted by $g_{m}$. With $D$ dominant over $d$, the rule is:\n$$\ng_{m}\\in\\{DD, D/d\\}\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\text{all offspring phenotypes are dextral},\\qquad g_{m}=d/d\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\text{all offspring phenotypes are sinistral}.\n$$\nThe hermaphroditic parent in this problem serves as the mother and has genotype $D/d$. Therefore, by the maternal effect rule, all immediate offspring will exhibit dextral shells regardless of their own genotypes.\n\nFor completeness, the self-fertilization of a $D/d$ individual yields the standard Mendelian genotype distribution among zygotes:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{4}DD:\\frac{1}{2}D/d:\\frac{1}{4}d/d.\n$$\nHowever, because the maternal genotype is $D/d$, the phenotype of every immediate offspring is dextral. The one-generation delay characteristic of maternal effect would only be revealed in the next generation when these offspring act as mothers.\n\nHence, the correct choice is that all immediate offspring are dextral.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1501971"}, {"introduction": "Having grasped the basic rule, we now explore the intriguing consequences of the one-generation delay inherent in maternal effect inheritance. This practice [@problem_id:1501926] presents a genetic puzzle: an individual displays a dominant-like phenotype but produces offspring with exclusively recessive-like phenotypes. By working backward from the observed outcomes, you can deduce the hidden genotypes and solidify your understanding of the disconnect between an individual's phenotype and its genetic makeup in this system.", "problem": "In the freshwater snail *Lymnaea peregra*, the direction of shell coiling is determined by a maternal effect gene. The allele for dextral (right-handed) coiling, denoted by $D$, is dominant to the allele for sinistral (left-handed) coiling, denoted by $d$. The phenotype of any individual snail is not determined by its own genotype but is instead exclusively dictated by the genotype of its mother (the egg-producing parent).\n\nA geneticist isolates a single, self-fertilizing hermaphroditic snail that has a dextral-coiled shell. This snail is allowed to self-fertilize, and it subsequently produces a large brood of offspring. Upon examining the offspring, the geneticist finds that all of them exhibit sinistral-coiled shells.\n\nBased on these observations, what are the respective genotypes of the original parent snail and its entire brood of offspring?\n\nA.

Parent: $d/d$, Offspring: A 1:1 ratio of $D/d$ and $d/d$", "solution": "Key principle: in a maternal-effect trait, each offspring’s phenotype is determined exclusively by the egg-producing parent’s genotype, not by the offspring’s own genotype. Here, $D$ (dextral) is dominant to $d$ (sinistral), so a mother with genotype $D/D$ or $D/d$ produces dextral offspring, whereas a mother with genotype $d/d$ produces sinistral offspring.\n\nObservation: the self-fertilizing parent has a dextral shell but produces a large brood in which all offspring are sinistral. Because the offspring phenotype is set by the mother’s genotype, the fact that all offspring are sinistral implies that the mother’s genotype must be $d/d$. If the mother carried any $D$ allele (i.e., were $D/D$ or $D/d$), all offspring would be dextral, which contradicts the observation.\n\nConsistency with the parent’s phenotype: the parent being dextral despite having genotype $d/d$ is entirely consistent with a maternal-effect gene, because the parent’s phenotype is determined by its own mother’s genotype. Thus, the parent could be $d/d$ in genotype but dextral in phenotype if its mother had at least one $D$ allele (i.e., was $D/D$ or $D/d$).\n\nPredicted offspring genotypes under selfing: a $d/d$ hermaphrodite produces only $d$ gametes, so all selfed offspring are $d/d$. This matches the complete sinistral phenotype observed (since their mother is $d/d$).\n\nTherefore, the original parent’s genotype is $d/d$, and all offspring are $d/d$, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1501926"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate test of a geneticist's understanding is the ability to design experiments that distinguish between competing hypotheses.

By predicting the full phenotypic outcomes for two generations under both models, you will be thinking like a researcher, creating a clear diagnostic test to reveal the underlying genetic mechanism.", "problem": "A developmental phenotype in a marine snail, dorsal stripe orientation, is hypothesized to be controlled by a single nuclear locus $D$ with two alleles, $M$ (wild type stripe orientation) and $m$ (mutant orientation). Assume complete penetrance, no genomic imprinting, no paternal effect, no mitochondrial or endosymbiont inheritance, and equal viability and fertility of all genotypes. At the level where the trait is expressed, a single copy of $M$ is sufficient to produce the wild type orientation when the gene acts in the embryo (that is, $M$ is dominant for the zygotic function). To test whether $m$ acts through a maternal effect (phenotype of an embryo depends on the genotype of its mother via maternally supplied products) or as a standard zygotic gene (phenotype of an embryo depends on its own genotype), you will perform a reciprocal cross plan and score phenotypes in the first and second filial generations.\n\nPlan: Set up two reciprocal parental crosses using verified true-breeding lines:\n- Cross $\\mathrm{P}$-$\\mathrm{A}$: female $MM$ $\\times$ male $mm$.\n- Cross $\\mathrm{P}$-$\\mathrm{B}$: female $mm$ $\\times$ male $MM$.\n\nFrom each cross, produce the first filial generation $\\mathrm{F}_1$ and score their phenotypes at the same developmental stage.

A solution can be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Expected Outcomes\n\nTwo distinct hypotheses must be analyzed: zygotic effect and maternal effect.\n\n#### Hypothesis 1: Zygotic Effect (Standard Mendelian Inheritance)\nUnder this hypothesis, the phenotype is determined by the individual's own genotype. The allele $M$ is dominant to $m$, so genotypes $MM$ and $Mm$ result in a wild-type phenotype, and $mm$ results in a mutant phenotype.\n\n1.  **$\\mathrm{F}_1$ Generation**:\n    - **Cross $\\mathrm{P}$-$\\mathrm{A}$**: female $MM$ $\\times$ male $mm$. The $MM$ parent produces only $M$ gametes, and the $mm$ parent produces only $m$ gametes. All $\\mathrm{F}_1$ progeny will have the genotype $Mm$. Due to the dominance of $M$, all $\\mathrm{F}_1$ progeny will have the **wild-type** phenotype.\n    - **Cross $\\mathrm{P}$-$\\mathrm{B}$**: female $mm$ $\\times$ male $MM$. The $mm$ parent produces only $m$ gametes, and the $MM$ parent produces only $M$ gametes. All $\\mathrm{F}_1$ progeny will again have the genotype $Mm$. All $\\mathrm{F}_1$ progeny will thus have the **wild-type** phenotype.\n    - **Conclusion for $\\mathrm{F}_1$**: In both reciprocal crosses, all $\\mathrm{F}_1$ individuals are phenotypically wild-type.\n\n2.  **$\\mathrm{F}_2$ Generation**:\n    - The $\\mathrm{F}_2$ generation is produced by intercrossing $\\mathrm{F}_1$ individuals: $Mm \\times Mm$. This is a monohybrid cross.\n    - According to the Law of Segregation, the genotypes of the $\\mathrm{F}_2$ progeny will be in the ratio $1 MM : 2 Mm : 1 mm$.\n    - The phenotypes will be:\n        - Genotypes $MM$ and $Mm$ are wild-type.\n        - Genotype $mm$ is mutant.\n    - The expected phenotypic ratio in the $\\mathrm{F}_2$ generation is therefore $(1+2) : 1$, which is **$3$ wild-type : $1$ mutant**. This result is expected from the pedigrees of both original crosses, $\\mathrm{P}$-$\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{P}$-$\\mathrm{B}$.\n\n#### Hypothesis 2: Maternal Effect\nUnder this hypothesis, the phenotype of an individual is determined by the genotype of its mother. The mother's nuclear genotype dictates the molecular constitution of the egg's cytoplasm, which in turn directs the early developmental program of the embryo. A mother with at least one $M$ allele ($MM$ or $Mm$) will produce eggs provisioned with the wild-type developmental signal, leading to wild-type progeny. A mother with genotype $mm$ will produce eggs that lead to mutant progeny.\n\n1.  **$\\mathrm{F}_1$ Generation**:\n    - **Cross $\\mathrm{P}$-$\\mathrm{A}$**: female $MM$ $\\times$ male $mm$. The mother's genotype is $MM$. Therefore, all her eggs are provisioned for wild-type development. All $\\mathrm{F}_1$ progeny will exhibit the **wild-type** phenotype, even though their genotype is $Mm$.\n    - **Cross $\\mathrm{P}$-$\\mathrm{B}$**: female $mm$ $\\times$ male $MM$. The mother's genotype is $mm$. Therefore, all her eggs lack the wild-type signal. All $\\mathrm{F}_1$ progeny will exhibit the **mutant** phenotype, despite having the genotype $Mm$.\n    - **Conclusion for $\\mathrm{F}_1$**: The reciprocal crosses yield different results. Progeny from the $MM$ mother are wild-type; progeny from the $mm$ mother are mutant.\n\n2.  **$\\mathrm{F}_2$ Generation**:\n    - The $\\mathrm{F}_2$ generation is produced by intercrossing $\\mathrm{F}_1$ individuals: $Mm \\times Mm$. This applies to both pedigrees, as the $\\mathrm{F}_1$ genotype is $Mm$ in both cases.\n    - The phenotype of an $\\mathrm{F}_2$ individual is determined by the genotype of its mother, who is an $\\mathrm{F}_1$ individual.\n    - The genotype of all $\\mathrm{F}_1$ mothers is $Mm$.\n    - Because these mothers possess the $M$ allele, they will provision all their eggs (which will become the $\\mathrm{F}_2$ zygotes) with the products necessary for wild-type development.\n    - Therefore, **all** $\\mathrm{F}_2$ progeny from both pedigrees will have the **wild-type** phenotype, regardless of their own individual genotypes (which are segregating $1 MM : 2 Mm : 1 mm$).\n\n### Summary of Predictions\n- **Zygotic Effect**:\n    - **$\\mathrm{F}_1$**: All progeny from both reciprocal crosses are wild-type.\n    - **$\\mathrm{F}_2$**: Progeny from both pedigrees show a $3:1$ wild-type:mutant phenotypic ratio.\n- **Maternal Effect**:\n    - **$\\mathrm{F}_1$**: Progeny from cross $\\mathrm{P}$-$\\mathrm{A}$ are all wild-type. Progeny from cross $\\mathrm{P}$-$\\mathrm{B}$ are all mutant.\n    - **$\\mathrm{F}_2$**: All progeny from both pedigrees are wild-type.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n- **A. Maternal effect: $\\mathrm{F}_1$ from $\\mathrm{P}$-$\\mathrm{A}$ all wild type; $\\mathrm{F}_1$ from $\\mathrm{P}$-$\\mathrm{B}$ all mutant; $\\mathrm{F}_2$ from either pedigree all wild type despite genotypic segregation. Zygotic effect: both reciprocal $\\mathrm{F}_1$ all wild type; $\\mathrm{F}_2$ from either pedigree show a $3:1$ wild type:mutant ratio.**\n    - This statement perfectly matches the results derived above for both the maternal effect hypothesis and the zygotic effect hypothesis.\n    - **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. Maternal effect: both reciprocal $\\mathrm{F}_1$ all wild type; $\\mathrm{F}_2$ from either pedigree show a $3:1$ wild type:mutant ratio. Zygotic effect: $\\mathrm{F}_1$ differ in the reciprocal crosses (one all wild type, the other all mutant); $\\mathrm{F}_2$ from either pedigree all wild type.**\n    - This option has swapped the expected outcomes for the two hypotheses. The description for maternal effect matches the zygotic case, and vice-versa.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. Maternal effect: $\\mathrm{F}_1$ from $\\mathrm{P}$-$\\mathrm{A}$ all wild type; $\\mathrm{F}_1$ from $\\mathrm{P}$-$\\mathrm{B}$ all mutant; $\\mathrm{F}_2$ from either pedigree show a $3:1$ wild type:mutant ratio. Zygotic effect: both reciprocal $\\mathrm{F}_1$ all wild type; $\\mathrm{F}_2$ from either pedigree show a $3:1$ wild type:mutant ratio.**\n    - The description of the maternal effect is flawed. While the $\\mathrm{F}_1$ outcomes are correct, the $\\mathrm{F}_2}$ outcome is wrong. For maternal effect, the $\\mathrm{F}_2}$ generation should be all wild-type, not segregate $3:1$.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. Maternal effect: $\\mathrm{F}_1$ from $\\mathrm{P}$-$\\mathrm{A}$ all wild type; $\\mathrm{F}_1$ from $\\mathrm{P}$-$\\mathrm{B}$ all mutant; $\\mathrm{F}_2$ from either pedigree show a $1:1$ wild type:mutant ratio because heterozygous mothers supply $M$ products to half their eggs. Zygotic effect: both reciprocal $\\mathrm{F}_1$ all wild type; $\\mathrm{F}_2$ from either pedigree show a $3:1$ wild type:mutant ratio.**\n    - The reasoning provided for the maternal effect in the $\\mathrm{F}_2}$ generation is biologically incorrect. A heterozygous mother's phenotype-determining products are supplied to all oocytes, not just those receiving the $M$ allele. The offspring phenotype depends on the mother's genotype, not the allele it inherits. The predicted ratio of $1:1$ is therefore incorrect; the result should be all wild-type progeny.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **E. Maternal effect: in both $\\mathrm{F}_1$ and $\\mathrm{F}_2$, offspring in each pedigree copy the phenotype of the original $\\mathrm{P}$ female regardless of genotypes. Zygotic effect: reciprocal $\\mathrm{F}_1$ differ because paternal $M$ cannot influence the egg’s cytoplasm; $\\mathrm{F}_2$ all wild type.**\n    - The maternal effect statement is flawed for the $\\mathrm{F}_2}$ generation. The $\\mathrm{F}_2}$ phenotype is determined by the $\\mathrm{F}_1$ mother's genotype ($Mm$), not the P-generation mother's genotype. So, for the pedigree from cross $\\mathrm{P}$-$\\mathrm{B}$ (original mother $mm$, mutant), the $\\mathrm{F}_2}$ progeny are wild-type, not mutant.\n    - The zygotic effect statement is entirely incorrect. The reciprocal $\\mathrm{F}_1}$ do not differ, and the $\\mathrm{F}_2}$ generation segregates $3:1$.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2827889"}]}
