This foundational exercise ([@problem_id:2791098]) challenges you to derive the expected phenotypic outcomes for a classic X-linked recessive cross over two generations. By carefully tracking the transmission of X and Y chromosomes from the parental (P) to the second filial ($F_2$) generation, you will solidify your understanding of how sex-linkage creates distinct, predictable patterns of inheritance that differ from autosomal traits.", "problem": "A single X-linked gene has two alleles: the wild-type dominant allele $A$ and a recessive disease allele $a$. In the X–Y sex-determination system, individuals with genotype $X^{A}X^{A}$ or $X^{A}X^{a}$ are unaffected females, individuals with genotype $X^{a}X^{a}$ are affected females, individuals with genotype $X^{A}Y$ are unaffected males, and individuals with genotype $X^{a}Y$ are affected males. Assume Mendel’s law of segregation holds for alleles during gametogenesis, gametes bearing $X$ or $Y$ chromosomes are produced in equal proportions by males, mating is random with respect to genotype, the sex ratio at birth is $1:1$, there is complete penetrance, and there is no selection, mutation, or meiotic drive.\n\nA true-breeding affected male (genotype $X^{a}Y$) is crossed to an unaffected homozygous female (genotype $X^{A}X^{A}$) to produce the first filial generation $F_{1}$. Then, a randomly chosen $F_{1}$ female is mated to a randomly chosen $F_{1}$ male to produce the second filial generation $F_{2}$.\n\nStarting only from the fundamental principles stated above and the definitions of X-linked recessive inheritance, derive the expected phenotypic composition by sex in $F_{1}$ and in $F_{2}$, carefully justifying each step from allele segregation and sex-specific transmission of the $X$ and $Y$ chromosomes.

The model is a standard and correct representation of this mode of transmission.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The initial conditions (P genotypes), the procedural steps (intercrosses), and the required outputs are all explicitly and unambiguously defined. A unique, stable solution can be derived.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, objective scientific terminology. It is free from ambiguity and subjective claims.\n- **Conclusion**: The problem is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It is deemed **valid**.\n\n**Step 3: Solution Derivation**\n\nWe proceed with the logical derivation of the solution.\n\n**Analysis of the $F_{1}$ Generation**\nThe parental cross is between a male of genotype $X^{a}Y$ and a female of genotype $X^{A}X^{A}$.\nThe female parent is homozygous and produces only one type of gamete, $X^{A}$, with probability $1$.\nThe male parent produces two types of gametes, $X^{a}$ and $Y$, with equal probability $1/2$ each.\n\nThe genotypes of the $F_{1}$ generation are determined by the possible combinations of these gametes. We can represent this with a Punnett square:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c}\n & X^{A} \\\\\n\\hline\nX^{a} & X^{A}X^{a} \\\\\n\\hline\nY & X^{A}Y\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe offspring genotypes are $X^{A}X^{a}$ and $X^{A}Y$, each occurring with a frequency of $1/2$.\n- $F_{1}$ females all have the genotype $X^{A}X^{a}$. Since $A$ is dominant, they are phenotypically unaffected.\n- $F_{1}$ males all have the genotype $X^{A}Y$. They are phenotypically unaffected.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic composition of the $F_{1}$ generation is:\n- Females: All are unaffected.\n- Males: All are unaffected.\n\n**Analysis of the $F_{2}$ Generation**\nThe $F_{2}$ generation is produced by mating a randomly chosen $F_{1}$ female with a randomly chosen $F_{1}$ male. Since all $F_{1}$ females are $X^{A}X^{a}$ and all $F_{1}$ males are $X^{A}Y$, this cross is fixed: $X^{A}X^{a} \\times X^{A}Y$.\n\n- The $F_{1}$ female ($X^{A}X^{a}$) produces two types of gametes, $X^{A}$ and $X^{a}$, with equal probability $1/2$ each.\n- The $F_{1}$ male ($X^{A}Y$) produces two types of gametes, $X^{A}$ and $Y$, with equal probability $1/2$ each.\n\nThe genotypes of the $F_{2}$ generation are determined by the combinations of these gametes, as shown in the following Punnett square. Each cell represents a proportion of $1/4$ of the total $F_{2}$ population.\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n & X^{A} \\text{ (from male)} & Y \\text{ (from male)} \\\\\n\\hline\nX^{A} \\text{ (from female)} & X^{A}X^{A} & X^{A}Y \\\\\nX^{a} \\text{ (from female)} & X^{A}X^{a} & X^{a}Y\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe four equally probable genotypes in the $F_{2}$ generation, each with frequency $1/4$, are:\n- $X^{A}X^{A}$: Unaffected female.\n- $X^{A}X^{a}$: Unaffected female.\n- $X^{A}Y$: Unaffected male.\n- $X^{a}Y$: Affected male.\n\nThe phenotypic composition of the $F_{2}$ generation by sex is as follows:\n- **Females**: The female offspring have genotypes $X^{A}X^{A}$ (frequency $1/4$) and $X^{A}X^{a}$ (frequency $1/4$). Both genotypes result in an unaffected phenotype. Thus, among the total female population (which comprises a fraction $1/2$ of $F_{2}$), all are unaffected.\n- **Males**: The male offspring have genotypes $X^{A}Y$ (frequency $1/4$) and $X^{a}Y$ (frequency $1/4$). The genotype $X^{A}Y$ corresponds to an unaffected phenotype, while $X^{a}Y$ corresponds to an affected phenotype. Thus, among the total male population (which comprises a fraction $1/2$ of $F_{2}$), a fraction of $1/2$ are unaffected and a fraction of $1/2$ are affected.\n\n**Final Calculation: Overall Fraction of Affected Individuals in $F_{2}$**\nThe problem asks for the overall fraction of affected individuals in the pooled $F_{2}$ population. We must sum the frequencies of all genotypes that lead to an affected phenotype.\n- The frequency of affected females (genotype $X^{a}X^{a}$) is $0$.\n- The frequency of affected males (genotype $X^{a}Y$) is $1/4$.\n\nThe total fraction of affected individuals in the $F_{2}$ generation is the sum of these frequencies:\n$$\n\\text{Fraction affected} = P(X^{a}X^{a}) + P(X^{a}Y) = 0 + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nThis is a reduced fraction as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$$", "id": "2791098"}, {"introduction": "While random mating is a common assumption in basic models, real populations exhibit complex structures, including consanguinity.

No numerical approximation or rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, free of contradictions or ambiguities. It presents a standard problem in population genetics that can be solved from first principles as requested.\n\nWe will address the two scenarios sequentially.\n\n**Scenario 1: Autosomal Recessive Inheritance**\n\nThe objective is to find the probability that the child of first-cousin parents has the genotype $aa$. This probability is denoted as $P(aa)$.\n\nThe population is in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium with allele frequencies $p$ for allele $A$ and $q$ for allele $a$.\n\nThe inbreeding coefficient, $F$, is defined as the probability that the two alleles at a given locus in an individual are identical by descent (IBD). For the offspring of a first-cousin mating, we are given $F = \\frac{1}{16}$.\n\nTo find the total probability of genotype $aa$, we consider two mutually exclusive events for the child's pair of alleles at this locus:\n1. The two alleles are identical by descent. The probability of this event is, by definition, $F$. If the alleles are IBD, they must be copies of a single allele from a common ancestor. For the child to have genotype $aa$, this single ancestral allele must have been of type $a$. The probability that a randomly chosen allele in the population's gene pool is $a$ is $q$. Therefore, the probability that the two alleles are IBD *and* are both of type $a$ is $F \\cdot q$.\n\n2. The two alleles are not identical by descent. The probability of this event is $(1 - F)$. If the alleles are not IBD, they are considered to be two independent draws from the population's gene pool. The probability of drawing an allele of type $a$ is $q$. The probability of independently drawing two alleles of type $a$ is $q \\times q = q^2$. Therefore, the probability that the two alleles are not IBD *and* are both of type $a$ is $(1 - F) \\cdot q^2$.\n\nThe total probability of the child having genotype $aa$ is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events:\n$$\nP(aa) = P(\\text{alleles are IBD and type } a) + P(\\text{alleles are not IBD and type } a)\n$$\n$$\nP(aa) = (F \\cdot q) + ((1 - F) \\cdot q^2)\n$$\nThis is the general formula for the frequency of a homozygous recessive genotype in a population with an average inbreeding coefficient of $F$.\n\nFor this specific problem, the parents are first cousins, so their child has an inbreeding coefficient of $F = \\frac{1}{16}$. Substituting this value into the derived expression:\n$$\nP(aa) = \\frac{1}{16} q + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{16}\\right) q^2\n$$\n$$\nP(aa) = \\frac{1}{16} q + \\frac{15}{16} q^2\n$$\nThis is the required expression for the probability of the child being affected in Scenario 1.\n\n**Scenario 2: X-linked Recessive Inheritance**\n\nThe objective is to find the probability that a male child of the same two first-cousin parents is affected. A male is affected if his genotype is $X_aY$.\n\nA male inherits his Y chromosome from his father and his X chromosome from his mother. Therefore, a male child's phenotype for an X-linked trait is determined exclusively by the allele on the X chromosome contributed by his mother. The genetic makeup of the father is irrelevant to the son's X-linked genotype.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that the male child is affected, which is the probability that he inherits an $X_a$ chromosome from his mother. This probability is equal to the frequency of the $X_a$ allele in the mother's gametes (ova).\n\nThe mother is one of the two first cousins. The problem states that the general population is panmictic, with the specified first-cousin mating being the only non-random mating under consideration. This implies that the mother herself is an individual drawn from the general population and is not the product of a consanguineous mating. Her genotype is determined by her parents, who are assumed to have mated randomly.\n\nThe problem states that the population is in \"sex-neutral equilibrium for the X chromosome so that the frequency of $a$ among X chromosomes is $q$.\" This means the frequency of the $X_a$ allele is $q$ in the entire pool of X chromosomes, which includes those in females and males.\nA female has two X chromosomes. As she is a random individual from the population, her two X chromosomes are considered independent samples from the population's X chromosome gene pool. The probability that any given X chromosome is of type $X_a$ is $q$.\n\nAccording to the law of segregation, the mother passes one of her two X chromosomes to her son, chosen at random with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ for each. Let the mother's two X chromosomes be $X_1$ and $X_2$. The probability that the son is affected is:\n$$\nP(\\text{son is } X_aY) = P(\\text{mother passes } X_a)\n$$\n$$\nP(\\text{mother passes } X_a) = \\frac{1}{2} P(X_1 \\text{ is } X_a) + \\frac{1}{2} P(X_2 \\text{ is } X_a)\n$$\nSince each chromosome is an independent sample from the gene pool where the frequency of $X_a$ is $q$:\n$$\nP(X_1 \\text{ is } X_a) = q\n$$\n$$\nP(X_2 \\text{ is } X_a) = q\n$$\nSubstituting these probabilities back gives:\n$$\nP(\\text{son is } X_aY) = \\frac{1}{2} q + \\frac{1}{2} q = q\n$$\nThe information that the mother's mating partner is her first cousin is extraneous to the calculation of her son's risk for an X-linked trait, as this risk depends only on her genetic constitution, which is established prior to this specific mating.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the male child is affected in Scenario 2 is simply $q$.\n\nThe final answer requires the two expressions for Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, in that order.\nScenario 1 probability: $\\frac{15}{16}q^2 + \\frac{1}{16}q$\nScenario 2 probability: $q$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{15}{16}q^2 + \\frac{1}{16}q & q \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2791152"}, {"introduction": "Genetic analysis in a clinical setting often involves reasoning under uncertainty.

This is a given condition of the problem. His genotype must be $X^A Y$.\n- $D_{H}$: The daughter is clinically healthy. This is the primary observation or evidence. A daughter is healthy if her genotype is $X^A X^a$ (heterozygous carrier) or $X^a X^a$ (homozygous non-carrier).\n- $D_{C}$: The daughter is a heterozygous carrier.

Since $F_A$ is a fixed background condition of the entire problem setup, we can denote the probability measure conditional on $F_A$ as $P'(\\cdot) = P(\\cdot | F_A)$. The problem then becomes calculating $P'(D_C | D_H)$.\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P'(D_C | D_H) = \\frac{P'(D_C \\cap D_H)}{P'(D_H)}$$\nThe problem states that heterozygous females are clinically healthy. This means the event $D_C$ (daughter is a carrier) is a subset of the event $D_H$ (daughter is healthy). Therefore, $D_C \\cap D_H = D_C$, and the equation simplifies to:\n$$P'(D_C | D_H) = \\frac{P'(D_C)}{P'(D_H)}$$\nThis means we must compute the total probability of the daughter being a carrier, $P'(D_C)$, and the total probability of the daughter being healthy, $P'(D_H)$, both within the context that the social father is affected.\n\nWe partition the probability space into four mutually exclusive and exhaustive scenarios based on paternity status and the mother's genotype. These two factors are independent.\n1.  Scenario $S_1$: Paternity is true and the mother is a carrier (Pat $\\cap$ $M_C$).\n    $P'(S_1) = P(\\text{Pat}) P(M_C) = (1-r)c_M = 0.99 \\times 0.10 = 0.099$.\n2.

Father ($X^A Y$) gives $X^A$. Mother ($X^A X^a$) can give $X^A$ (prob 1/2) or $X^a$ (prob 1/2). Daughter is a carrier ($X^A X^a$) if she receives $X^a$ from mother. So, $P'(D_C | S_1) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n-   $P'(D_C | S_2)$: Paternity is true. Father ($X^A Y$) gives $X^A$. Mother ($X^a X^a$) gives $X^a$. The daughter's genotype is necessarily $X^A X^a$.

Father ($X^A Y$) gives $X^A$. Mother ($X^A X^a$) gives $X^A$ for an affected daughter ($X^A X^A$) with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. So, $P'(D_A | S_1) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n-   $P'(D_A | S_2)$: Father gives $X^A$, mother gives $X^a$. Daughter is $X^A X^a$ and not affected. So, $P'(D_A | S_2) = 0$.\n-   $P'(D_A | S_3)$: Paternity is false. A random father gives $X^A$ with probability $q$. Mother ($X^A X^a$) gives $X^A$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. The probability of an affected daughter is $q \\times \\frac{1}{2}$.\n-   $P'(D_A | S_4)$: Mother ($X^a X^a$) gives $X^a$. The daughter cannot be $X^A X^A$. So, $P'(D_A | S_4) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these into the sum for $P'(D_A)$:\n$P'(D_A) = (\\frac{1}{2}) (1-r)c_M + (0) (1-r)(1-c_M) + (\\frac{q}{2}) r c_M + (0) r(1-c_M)$\n$P'(D_A) = (\\frac{1}{2})(0.099) + 0 + (\\frac{10^{-4}}{2})(0.001) + 0$\n$P'(D_A) = 0.0495 + (5 \\times 10^{-5})(0.001) = 0.0495 + 5 \\times 10^{-8} = 0.04950005$.\n\nNow we find $P'(D_H)$:\n$P'(D_H) = 1 - P'(D_A) = 1 - 0.04950005 = 0.95049995$.\n\nFinally, we compute the desired posterior probability:\n$$P'(D_C | D_H) = \\frac{P'(D_C)}{P'(D_H)} = \\frac{0.9410009}{0.95049995}$$\n$$P'(D_C | D_H) \\approx 0.98999994739$$\nThe problem requires the answer rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$0.9899999...$ rounded to four significant figures is $0.9900$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9900}$$", "id": "2791119"}]}
