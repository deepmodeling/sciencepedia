It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in population genetics. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nLet us analyze the generational dynamics of allele frequencies and the resulting sex ratio. The state of the system is defined by the frequency of the male-determining allele, $A$, in the male gamete pool (sperm).\n\nIn any generation $t$, let $p_t$ be the frequency of allele $A$ in sperm, and $q_t = 1 - p_t$ be the frequency of allele $a$ in sperm. According to the problem statement, all females have the genotype $aa$. Consequently, all female gametes (eggs) carry the allele $a$, so the frequency of allele $a$ in the egg pool is $1$.\n\nZygotes of the next generation, $t+1$, are formed by the random union of sperm from generation $t$ and eggs from generation $t$. The resulting zygotic genotypes and their frequencies are:\n1.  Union of a sperm carrying $A$ (frequency $p_t$) and an egg carrying $a$ (frequency $1$): This produces a zygote of genotype $Aa$ with frequency $p_t \\times 1 = p_t$.\n2.  Union of a sperm carrying $a$ (frequency $q_t = 1 - p_t$) and an egg carrying $a$ (frequency $1$): This produces a zygote of genotype $aa$ with frequency $(1 - p_t) \\times 1 = 1 - p_t$.\n\nThe genotype $AA$ cannot be formed, as it would require both the sperm and the egg to carry the $A$ allele, which is impossible since all eggs carry the $a$ allele.\n\nNext, we map these zygote genotypes to their corresponding sexes for generation $t+1$:\n-   Zygotes with genotype $Aa$ develop into males. The fraction of males in generation $t+1$ is therefore $p_t$.\n-   Zygotes with genotype $aa$ develop into females. The fraction of females in generation $t+1$ is therefore $1 - p_t$.\n\nNow, we must find the recurrence relation that connects $p_{t+1}$ to $p_t$. The term $p_{t+1}$ is defined as the frequency of the $A$ allele in the sperm produced by the males of generation $t+1$.\n\nFrom our analysis above, all males in generation $t+1$ have the genotype $Aa$. There are no $AA$ males in generation $t+1$ (nor in any subsequent generation, as they can never be produced).\nAccording to the principle of Mendelian segregation, an individual with genotype $Aa$ produces gametes containing allele $A$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ and allele $a$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ (assuming no meiotic drive, as stated).\n\nSince the entire male population of generation $t+1$ consists of individuals with genotype $Aa$, the allele frequencies in the sperm pool they produce will be:\n-   Frequency of allele $A$: $p_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n-   Frequency of allele $a$: $q_{t+1} = 1 - p_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nThis result holds for any generation $t \\ge 0$. The initial frequency $p_0$ determines the sex ratio of generation $1$, but the allele frequency in the sperm pool of generation $1$ will be $p_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$. This is because the males of generation $1$ are formed from sperm of generation $0$ (with $A$ frequency $p_0$) and eggs of generation $0$ (all $a$), resulting in all males of generation $1$ being genotype $Aa$. These $Aa$ males then produce sperm where the frequency of allele $A$ is $p_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFor any subsequent generation $t \\geq 1$, we have $p_t = \\frac{1}{2}$. The system reaches a stable state, or equilibrium, after one generation of random mating.\nThe stable fraction of male zygotes at birth is the fraction of males in the population once this equilibrium is reached. The fraction of male zygotes in generation $t+1$ is equal to the frequency of the $Aa$ genotype, which is $p_t$.\nAt equilibrium, for any generation $t+1$ where $t \\ge 1$, the fraction of male zygotes is given by $p_t = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the stable fraction of male zygotes at birth under this sex determination system is precisely $\\frac{1}{2}$. This corresponds to a stable $1:1$ sex ratio.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$", "id": "2849965"}, {"introduction": "We now shift our focus to the widespread XX/XY chromosomal system, where genes on the sex chromosomes exhibit unique inheritance patterns. This practice requires you to derive the expected genotype frequencies for an X-linked locus after one generation of random mating, starting from different allele frequencies in males and females.

It is a standard, well-posed problem in population genetics that is scientifically grounded and objectively formulated. It requires the application of fundamental principles of Mendelian inheritance to a sex-linked locus. The provided information is complete and consistent, allowing for a unique derivation of the requested genotype frequencies. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe core principle is that offspring genotypes are determined by the random union of gametes from the parental generation. We must first determine the frequencies of alleles in the gametes produced by the male and female populations.\n\nStep 1: Determine Gamete Frequencies\nFemales are of genotype $XX$. The frequency of allele $A$ on their $X$ chromosomes is given as $p_{f}$, and the frequency of allele $a$ is therefore $1 - p_{f}$. Due to the principle of segregation (ii), the eggs (female gametes) produced will carry allele $A$ with frequency $p_{f}$ and allele $a$ with frequency $1 - p_{f}$.\n- Frequency of $A$ in eggs: $p_{f}$\n- Frequency of $a$ in eggs: $1 - p_{f}$\n\nMales are of genotype $XY$. Their single $X$ chromosome carries either allele $A$ or $a$. The frequency of allele $A$ among males is given as $p_{m}$, so the frequency of males with genotype $A$ (more precisely, $X^{A}Y$) is $p_{m}$. The frequency of males with genotype $a$ (i.e., $X^{a}Y$) is $1 - p_{m}$. Males produce two types of gametes in equal numbers (iii): $X$-bearing sperm and $Y$-bearing sperm. The allele carried by an $X$-bearing sperm is the one from the male's own $X$ chromosome.\n- Frequency of $X$-bearing sperm carrying $A$: $p_{m}$\n- Frequency of $X$-bearing sperm carrying $a$: $1 - p_{m}$\n- $Y$-bearing sperm do not carry this locus.\n\nStep 2: Calculate Genotype Frequencies in Offspring\nThe genotype frequencies in the next generation are found by considering the random union of eggs and sperm, as dictated by the assumption of random mating (i). We must consider female and male offspring separately.\n\nFemale Offspring ($XX$):\nA female offspring inherits one $X$ chromosome from her mother (egg) and one $X$ chromosome from her father (sperm). The frequencies of the three possible female genotypes ($AA$, $Aa$, $aa$) are calculated as follows:\n- The probability of a female zygote having genotype $AA$ is the product of the probability that the egg carries $A$ and the probability that the $X$-bearing sperm carries $A$.\n  Frequency($AA$ female) = (Freq. of $A$ in eggs) $\\times$ (Freq. of $A$ in $X$-sperm) = $p_{f} \\times p_{m}$\n- The probability of a female zygote having genotype $aa$ is the product of the probability that the egg carries $a$ and the probability that the $X$-bearing sperm carries $a$.\n  Frequency($aa$ female) = (Freq. of $a$ in eggs) $\\times$ (Freq. of $a$ in $X$-sperm) = $(1 - p_{f})(1 - p_{m})$\n- A female zygote can have genotype $Aa$ in two ways: an $A$ egg fertilized by an $a$ sperm, or an $a$ egg fertilized by an $A$ sperm. The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events.\n  Frequency($Aa$ female) = (Freq. of $A$ in eggs)(Freq. of $a$ in $X$-sperm) + (Freq. of $a$ in eggs)(Freq. of $A$ in $X$-sperm)\n  $= p_{f}(1 - p_{m}) + (1 - p_{f})p_{m}$\n  $= p_{f} - p_{f}p_{m} + p_{m} - p_{f}p_{m}$\n  $= p_{f} + p_{m} - 2p_{f}p_{m}$\n\nAs a check, the sum of female genotype frequencies must be $1$:\n$p_{f}p_{m} + (p_{f} + p_{m} - 2p_{f}p_{m}) + (1 - p_{f})(1 - p_{m}) = p_{f}p_{m} + p_{f} + p_{m} - 2p_{f}p_{m} + 1 - p_{f} - p_{m} + p_{f}p_{m} = 1$. The calculation is consistent.\n\nMale Offspring ($XY$):\nA male offspring inherits his single $X$ chromosome from his mother (egg) and a $Y$ chromosome from his father (sperm). Therefore, the allele on his $X$ chromosome is determined exclusively by the allele present in the egg from which he was conceived.\n- The probability of a male zygote having genotype $A$ (hemizygous) is equal to the frequency of eggs carrying the $A$ allele.\n  Frequency($A$ male) = Freq. of $A$ in eggs = $p_{f}$\n- The probability of a male zygote having genotype $a$ (hemizygous) is equal to the frequency of eggs carrying the $a$ allele.\n  Frequency($a$ male) = Freq. of $a$ in eggs = $1 - p_{f}$\n\nAs a check, the sum of male genotype frequencies must be $1$:\n$p_{f} + (1 - p_{f}) = 1$. The calculation is consistent.\n\nThe problem requires the five frequencies to be presented as a single row vector in the order: female $AA$, female $Aa$, female $aa$, male $A$, male $a$. Based on the derivation, these frequencies are:\n1.  Female $AA$: $p_{f}p_{m}$\n2.  Female $Aa$: $p_{f} + p_{m} - 2p_{f}p_{m}$\n3.  Female $aa$: $(1 - p_{f})(1 - p_{m})$\n4.  Male $A$: $p_{f}$\n5.  Male $a$: $1 - p_{f}$\n\nThis concludes the derivation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\np_{f} p_{m} & p_{f} + p_{m} - 2 p_{f} p_{m} & (1-p_{f})(1-p_{m}) & p_{f} & 1-p_{f}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2849906"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice integrates genetic principles with statistical reasoning to solve a common puzzle in genetic analysis.
