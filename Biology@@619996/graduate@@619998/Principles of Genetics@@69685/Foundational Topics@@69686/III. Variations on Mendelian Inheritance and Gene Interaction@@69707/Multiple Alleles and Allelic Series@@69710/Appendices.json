It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and all data provided are consistent. Therefore, we may proceed with its solution.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts: first, the derivation of the allele-frequency recursion; second, the determination of the internal equilibrium conditions and their general solution; and third, the calculation of a specific equilibrium frequency for a given fitness matrix.\n\nFirst, let us derive the allele-frequency recursion for allele $A_{i}$.\nThe premises are: a diploid, randomly mating population of effectively infinite size. Zygotes are formed in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) proportions. The frequencies of the alleles $A_{1}$, $A_{2}$, and $A_{3}$ at the zygote stage are $p_{1}$, $p_{2}$, and $p_{3}$, respectively, with $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} p_{i}=1$.\nThe frequencies of the six possible genotypes at the zygote stage under HWE are:\n- Homozygotes: $P(A_{i}A_{i}) = p_{i}^{2}$ for $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$\n- Heterozygotes: $P(A_{i}A_{j}) = 2p_{i}p_{j}$ for $i \\neq j$, $i,j \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$\n\nViability selection acts upon these zygotes. The fitness of genotype $(A_{i},A_{j})$ is given by $w_{ij}$, where $W=(w_{ij})$ is a symmetric $3 \\times 3$ matrix. After selection, the relative proportion of each genotype is its initial frequency multiplied by its fitness. To obtain the actual frequencies of genotypes among adults, we must normalize by the mean fitness of the population, $\\bar{w}$. The mean fitness is the sum of the fitness of each genotype weighted by its HWE frequency:\n$$\n\\bar{w} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\sum_{j=1}^{3} P(A_{i}A_{j}) w_{ij} = p_{1}^{2}w_{11} + p_{2}^{2}w_{22} + p_{3}^{2}w_{33} + 2p_{1}p_{2}w_{12} + 2p_{1}p_{3}w_{13} + 2p_{2}p_{3}w_{23}\n$$\nThe frequencies of the genotypes among the surviving adults are:\n$$\nP'_{ii} = \\frac{p_{i}^{2} w_{ii}}{\\bar{w}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad P'_{ij} = \\frac{2p_{i}p_{j} w_{ij}}{\\bar{w}} \\quad \\text{for } i \\neq j\n$$\nThe frequency of an allele in the next generation, $p'_{i}$, is its frequency in the gamete pool produced by these adults. The frequency of allele $A_{i}$ is the frequency of $A_{i}A_{i}$ homozygotes plus half the sum of the frequencies of all heterozygotes containing $A_{i}$. For $i=1$, for example:\n$$\np'_{1} = P'_{11} + \\frac{1}{2}P'_{12} + \\frac{1}{2}P'_{13} = \\frac{p_{1}^{2}w_{11}}{\\bar{w}} + \\frac{p_{1}p_{2}w_{12}}{\\bar{w}} + \\frac{p_{1}p_{3}w_{13}}{\\bar{w}}\n$$\nFactoring out $p_{1}$:\n$$\np'_{1} = \\frac{p_{1}(p_{1}w_{11} + p_{2}w_{12} + p_{3}w_{13})}{\\bar{w}}\n$$\nWe define the marginal fitness of allele $A_{i}$ as $w_{i} = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} p_{j}w_{ij}$. Using this definition, the expression for $p'_{1}$ simplifies to:\n$$\np'_{1} = p_{1} \\frac{w_{1}}{\\bar{w}}\n$$\nGeneralizing for any allele $A_{i}$, the recursion equation is:\n$$\np'_{i} = p_{i} \\frac{w_{i}}{\\bar{w}} = p_{i} \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{3} p_{j}w_{ij}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{3}\\sum_{l=1}^{3} p_{k}p_{l}w_{kl}}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nSecond, we must find the conditions for an internal polymorphism equilibrium.\nAn equilibrium is a state where allele frequencies do not change from one generation to the next, i.e., $p'_{i} = p^{*}_{i}$ for all $i$. Let $p^{*}_{i}$ denote the equilibrium frequency of allele $A_{i}$. The condition becomes:\n$$\np^{*}_{i} = p^{*}_{i} \\frac{w^{*}_{i}}{\\bar{w}^{*}}\n$$\nwhere $w^{*}_{i}$ and $\\bar{w}^{*}$ are the marginal and mean fitnesses calculated at the equilibrium frequencies $\\{p^{*}_{j}\\}$. For an internal polymorphism, we require $p^{*}_{i} \\in (0,1)$ for all $i$. This allows us to divide by $p^{*}_{i} \\neq 0$, which yields:\n$$\n1 = \\frac{w^{*}_{i}}{\\bar{w}^{*}} \\implies w^{*}_{i} = \\bar{w}^{*} \\quad \\text{for all } i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}\n$$\nThis is the fundamental condition for a fully polymorphic equilibrium: the marginal fitnesses of all alleles present in the population must be equal. This gives us a system of equations: $w^{*}_{1}=w^{*}_{2}=w^{*}_{3}$. Let us denote this common value by $\\lambda$.\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\np^{*}_{1}w_{11} + p^{*}_{2}w_{12} + p^{*}_{3}w_{13} = \\lambda \\\\\np^{*}_{1}w_{21} + p^{*}_{2}w_{22} + p^{*}_{3}w_{23} = \\lambda \\\\\np^{*}_{1}w_{31} + p^{*}_{2}w_{32} + p^{*}_{3}w_{33} = \\lambda\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nIn linear algebraic notation, if $\\mathbf{p}^{*} = (p^{*}_{1}, p^{*}_{2}, p^{*}_{3})^{T}$ and $\\mathbf{1} = (1,1,1)^{T}$, this system is written as $W\\mathbf{p}^{*} = \\lambda \\mathbf{1}$.\nProvided that the fitness matrix $W$ is invertible, we can solve for $\\mathbf{p}^{*}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{p}^{*} = W^{-1}(\\lambda \\mathbf{1}) = \\lambda W^{-1}\\mathbf{1}\n$$\nTo solve for the scalar $\\lambda$, we use the constraint that the allele frequencies must sum to unity: $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} p^{*}_{i} = 1$. In vector notation, this is $\\mathbf{1}^{T}\\mathbf{p}^{*} = 1$. Substituting the expression for $\\mathbf{p}^{*}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{1}^{T}(\\lambda W^{-1}\\mathbf{1}) = 1 \\implies \\lambda (\\mathbf{1}^{T}W^{-1}\\mathbf{1}) = 1\n$$\nSolving for $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\mathbf{1}^{T}W^{-1}\\mathbf{1}}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $\\mathbf{p}^{*}$ gives the closed-form solution for the internal equilibrium frequency vector:\n$$\n\\mathbf{p}^{*} = \\frac{W^{-1}\\mathbf{1}}{\\mathbf{1}^{T}W^{-1}\\mathbf{1}}\n$$\nThe term $\\mathbf{1}^{T}W^{-1}\\mathbf{1}$ is the sum of all elements of the inverse fitness matrix $W^{-1}$, and the vector $W^{-1}\\mathbf{1}$ is the vector of row sums of $W^{-1}$. Therefore, the equilibrium frequency of allele $A_{i}$ is the sum of the elements in the $i$-th row of $W^{-1}$ divided by the sum of all elements of $W^{-1}$.\n\nThird, we compute the equilibrium frequency $p^{*}_{1}$ for the specific viability matrix:\n$$\nW = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.8 & 1.0 & 1.1 \\\\ 1.0 & 0.85 & 1.05 \\\\ 1.1 & 1.05 & 0.9 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo use our formula, we must compute $W^{-1}$.

Assuming Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), the frequency of a genotype formed from alleles $A^{i}$ and $A^{j}$ is $p_{i}^{2}$ for homozygotes ($i=j$) and $2p_{i}p_{j}$ for heterozygotes ($i \\neq j$), where $p_{i}$ and $p_{j}$ are the respective allele frequencies.\nLet $p_{+}$ be the frequency of the wild-type allele $A^{+}$, and $p_{k}$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$ be the frequencies of the mutant alleles $A^{0}, A^{1}, A^{2}, A^{3}$. The sum of all allele frequencies is $1$.\nThe mean fitness is $\\bar{w} = \\sum_{i,j} f_{ij} w_{ij}$, where $f_{ij}$ is the HWE frequency and $w_{ij}$ is the relative fitness of genotype $A^{i}/A^{j}$.\nThe genetic load can be expressed as $L = \\sum_{i,j} f_{ij} (1-w_{ij})$.\n\nSince the forward mutation rates, $\\mu_k$, are small, the equilibrium frequencies, $\\hat{p}_k$, of the mutant alleles will also be small. Consequently, the wild-type allele frequency $\\hat{p}_{+}$ will be close to $1$. This allows us to make approximations by retaining only the leading-order terms in the small parameters $\\mu_k$.\n\nFirst, we determine the equilibrium frequencies of the mutant alleles under mutation-selection balance. At equilibrium, the rate of introduction of new mutant alleles by mutation is balanced by their rate of removal by selection.\n\nFor the recessive lethal null allele, $A^{0}$:\nMutation introduces $A^{0}$ alleles at a rate $\\mu_{0} \\hat{p}_{+} \\approx \\mu_{0}$. Selection acts against $A^{0}$ primarily through the lethal homozygote $A^{0}/A^{0}$, which has frequency $\\hat{p}_{0}^{2}$ and fitness $w(A^{0}/A^{0}) = 0$. The heterozygote $A^{+}/A^{0}$ has fitness $w(A^{+}/A^{0}) = 1$ and thus experiences no selection. The rate of removal of $A^{0}$ alleles is the frequency of lethal homozygotes, $\\hat{p}_{0}^{2}$.\nBalancing introduction and removal:\n$$ \\mu_{0} \\approx \\hat{p}_{0}^{2} $$\n$$ \\hat{p}_{0} \\approx \\sqrt{\\mu_{0}} $$\n\nFor the hypomorphic alleles, $A^{i}$ where $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$:\nMutation introduces $A^{i}$ alleles at a rate $\\mu_{i} \\hat{p}_{+} \\approx \\mu_{i}$. Selection acts against these alleles in both heterozygotes $A^{+}/A^{i}$ and homozygotes $A^{i}/A^{i}$. The fitnesses are $w(A^{+}/A^{i}) = 1 - h_{i}s_{i}$ and $w(A^{i}/A^{i}) = 1 - s_{i}$.\nThe loss of $A^{i}$ alleles per generation is approximately the sum of losses from heterozygotes and homozygotes: $h_{i}s_{i} \\hat{p}_{+} \\hat{p}_{i} + s_{i} \\hat{p}_{i}^{2} \\approx h_{i}s_{i} \\hat{p}_{i}$. The homozygous term is neglected as it is of a smaller order of magnitude. The balance equation is:\n$$ \\mu_{i} \\approx h_{i}s_{i} \\hat{p}_{i} $$\n$$ \\hat{p}_{i} \\approx \\frac{\\mu_{i}}{h_{i}s_{i}} \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $$\nThis approximation is valid because $h_i > 0$.\n\nNow we calculate the genetic load to the first order in the mutation rates.\n$L = 1 - \\bar{w} = \\sum f_{ij}(1-w_{ij})$\n$$ L = (1-w_{++})\\hat{p}_{+}^{2} + \\sum_{k=0}^{3} 2(1-w_{+k})\\hat{p}_{+}\\hat{p}_{k} + \\sum_{k=0}^{3} (1-w_{kk})\\hat{p}_{k}^{2} + \\sum_{k \\neq l} 2(1-w_{kl})\\hat{p}_{k}\\hat{p}_{l} $$\nWith $w_{++} = 1$ and $\\hat{p}_{+} \\approx 1$, the expression for $L$ to leading order includes all terms that are of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\mu_k)$. Let's analyze the terms:\n1.  Term for $A^{0}$:\n    - Heterozygote $A^{+}/A^{0}$: The contribution is $2(1-w_{+0})\\hat{p}_{0} = 2(1-1)\\hat{p}_{0} = 0$.\n    - Homozygote $A^{0}/A^{0}$: The contribution is $(1-w_{00})\\hat{p}_{0}^{2} = (1-0)(\\sqrt{\\mu_{0}})^{2} = \\mu_{0}$. This is first order in $\\mu_0$.\n2.  Terms for $A^{i}$ ($i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$):\n    - Heterozygote $A^{+}/A^{i}$: The contribution is $2(1-w_{+i})\\hat{p}_{i} = 2(h_{i}s_{i})\\hat{p}_{i}$. Substituting $\\hat{p}_{i} = \\mu_{i}/(h_{i}s_{i})$, this becomes $2(h_{i}s_{i})\\frac{\\mu_{i}}{h_{i}s_{i}} = 2\\mu_{i}$. This is first order in $\\mu_i$.\n    - Homozygote $A^{i}/A^{i}$: The contribution is $(1-w_{ii})\\hat{p}_{i}^{2} = s_{i}(\\frac{\\mu_{i}}{h_{i}s_{i}})^{2} = \\frac{\\mu_{i}^{2}}{h_{i}^{2}s_{i}}$. This is of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\mu_{i}^{2})$ and is neglected.\n3.  Terms for double-mutant heterozygotes $A^{k}/A^{l}$ ($k,l \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}, k \\neq l$):\n    - Frequencies are $2\\hat{p}_{k}\\hat{p}_{l}$. These are of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\mu_k \\mu_l)$ or $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\mu_0}\\mu_i)$, which are higher than first order. For instance, $\\hat{p}_0 \\hat{p}_1 \\sim \\sqrt{\\mu_0} \\mu_1$. If all $\\mu_k \\sim \\epsilon$, this is $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{1.5})$, which is a higher-order term than $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)$. Thus, all contributions from these genotypes are neglected in a first-order calculation.\n\nSumming up all first-order contributions to the load:\n$$ L \\approx \\mu_{0} + 2\\mu_{1} + 2\\mu_{2} + 2\\mu_{3} $$\nThis expression embodies the Haldane-Muller principle: the genetic load from partially dominant deleterious mutations at equilibrium is twice the mutation rate to those alleles, while for a recessive lethal it is equal to the mutation rate. Note that the specific values of $s_i$ and $h_i$ are not present in the final formula for the load, a key result of this principle.\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided:\n$\\mu_{0} = 1.7 \\times 10^{-6}$\n$\\mu_{1} = 3.2 \\times 10^{-6}$\n$\\mu_{2} = 0.9 \\times 10^{-6}$\n$\\mu_{3} = 1.4 \\times 10^{-6}$\n\n$$ L \\approx (1.7 \\times 10^{-6}) + 2 \\times (3.2 \\times 10^{-6}) + 2 \\times (0.9 \\times 10^{-6}) + 2 \\times (1.4 \\times 10^{-6}) $$\n$$ L \\approx 1.7 \\times 10^{-6} + 6.4 \\times 10^{-6} + 1.8 \\times 10^{-6} + 2.8 \\times 10^{-6} $$\n$$ L \\approx (1.7 + 6.4 + 1.8 + 2.8) \\times 10^{-6} $$\n$$ L \\approx 12.7 \\times 10^{-6} $$\n$$ L \\approx 1.27 \\times 10^{-5} $$\nAs a decimal, this is $0.0000127$. Rounding to four significant figures gives $0.00001270$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0.00001270} $$", "id": "2831948"}]}
