A single gene mutation causes a reduction in the total number of these progenitor cells, creating a fixed-size pool of $N$ cells.\n\nDuring development, each of these $N$ progenitor cells stochastically and independently commits to one of three possible fates:\n1.  It differentiates to become part of Organ A with a probability $p_A$.\n2.  It differentiates to become part of Organ B with a probability $p_B$.\n3.  It undergoes apoptosis (programmed cell death) and is lost, with a probability $p_L = 1 - p_A - p_B$.\n\nThe number of cells normally required for the complete and proper formation of these organs are $C_A$ and $C_B$, which are constant values. Due to the limited progenitor pool, the actual number of cells that form each organ, denoted by the random variables $n_A$ and $n_B$, may be less than what is required. The severity of a developmental defect in an organ is defined as its cellular deficit, which is the required number of cells minus the actual number of cells. Let these deficits be $D_A = C_A - n_A$ and $D_B = C_B - n_B$.\n\nObservations in populations carrying this mutation reveal an inverse correlation in the severity of defects between the two organs: individuals with a severely underdeveloped crest tend to have more developed spars, and vice-versa.
