A functional enzyme is produced by the presence of at least one dominant allele at its locus (that is, $A\\_$ produces a functional $A$-enzyme and $B\\_$ produces a functional $B$-enzyme), while the homozygous recessive genotypes $aa$ or $bb$ produce no functional enzyme for their respective steps. The pigment is synthesized only if both steps proceed; if either step fails, no pigment accumulates.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a complete and consistent set of givens to derive a unique solution based on fundamental principles of Mendelian genetics. No flaws are identified. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected fraction of pigmented individuals in the $\\mathrm{F}_2$ generation, derived from first principles. The synthesis of pigment requires functional enzymes from two unlinked genes, $A$ and $B$. A functional enzyme is produced if at least one dominant allele is present at the corresponding locus. Therefore, the genotype for the pigmented phenotype must be of the form $A\\_B\\_$. Any other genotype—$A\\_bb$, $aaB\\_$, or $aabb$—will result in a white phenotype due to the failure of at least one enzymatic step.\n\nFirst, we determine the genotype of the $\\mathrm{F}_1$ generation. The cross is between two true-breeding parental lines: $AAbb \\times aaBB$.\nThe parent with genotype $AAbb$ is homozygous and can only produce gametes of genotype $Ab$.\nThe parent with genotype $aaBB$ is homozygous and can only produce gametes of genotype $aB$.\nThe fertilization event combines these gametes, resulting in an $\\mathrm{F}_1$ generation with a uniform genotype of $AaBb$.\n\nThe phenotype of the $\\mathrm{F}_1$ generation ($AaBb$) is pigmented, as this genotype includes at least one dominant $A$ allele and at least one dominant $B$ allele, satisfying the condition for the synthesis of both required enzymes. This is a novel phenotype not present in the white-flowered parental generation, a hallmark of complementary gene action.\n\nNext, the $\\mathrm{F}_1$ generation is self-crossed: $AaBb \\times AaBb$. To find the phenotypic fractions in the $\\mathrm{F}_2$ generation, we will apply the Law of Segregation and the Law of Independent Assortment. Since the genes are unlinked, we can analyze the inheritance of each gene pair independently.\n\nConsider the segregation at the $A$ locus from the cross $Aa \\times Aa$. According to Mendel's Law of Segregation, the alleles $A$ and $a$ segregate during gamete formation. Each parent produces gametes containing $A$ and $a$ with equal probability, $P(A) = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $P(a) = \\frac{1}{2}$. The probabilities of the offspring genotypes are:\n- $P(AA) = P(A) \\times P(A) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- $P(Aa) = P(A) \\times P(a) + P(a) \\times P(A) = (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- $P(aa) = P(a) \\times P(a) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThe probability of an offspring having at least one dominant $A$ allele (genotypes $AA$ or $Aa$), which corresponds to producing a functional $A$-enzyme, is:\n$P(A\\_) = P(AA) + P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\nThe probability of an offspring having the homozygous recessive genotype $aa$, which produces no functional $A$-enzyme, is:\n$P(aa) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nSimilarly, for the $B$ locus, the cross is $Bb \\times Bb$. By the same application of the Law of Segregation, the probability of an offspring having at least one dominant $B$ allele (genotypes $BB$ or $Bb$), which corresponds to producing a functional $B$-enzyme, is:\n$P(B\\_) = P(BB) + P(Bb) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\nThe probability of an offspring having the homozygous recessive genotype $bb$, which produces no functional $B$-enzyme, is:\n$P(bb) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe pigmented phenotype requires the presence of both functional enzymes, which corresponds to the genotypic class $A\\_B\\_$. According to the Law of Independent Assortment, the probability of two independent events occurring together is the product of their individual probabilities. Since the genes $A$ and $B$ are unlinked, their inheritance is independent.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of $\\mathrm{F}_2$ individuals expected to be pigmented is the probability of an individual having the genotype $A\\_$ AND the genotype $B\\_$:\n$P(\\text{pigmented}) = P(A\\_B\\_) = P(A\\_) \\times P(B\\_)$\nSubstituting the derived probabilities:\n$P(\\text{pigmented}) = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{9}{16}$.\n\nThis fraction represents the portion of the $\\mathrm{F}_2$ progeny that inherited at least one dominant allele for each of the two genes, allowing the complete metabolic pathway for pigment synthesis to proceed. The remaining fraction, $1 - \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{7}{16}$, corresponds to the individuals with a white phenotype ($A\\_bb$, $aaB\\_$, and $aabb$).

The problem is well-posed, objective, and free from any scientific or logical flaws.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is valid.

Then, the Pearson chi-square statistic is computed.\n\nThe null hypothesis ($H_0$) states that the observed phenotypic frequencies do not significantly differ from the frequencies expected from a $9:3:4$ ratio. The total number of parts in this ratio is $9 + 3 + 4 = 16$.\n\nThe expected probabilities ($P_i$) for each of the three phenotypic classes are:\n- Dark green ($A\\_B\\_$): $P_{DG} = \\frac{9}{16}$\n- Pale green ($aaB\\_$): $P_{PG} = \\frac{3}{16}$\n- Colorless ($\\_\\_bb$): $P_{C} = \\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThe expected counts ($E_i$) are calculated by multiplying the total sample size $N = 400$ by the expected probability for each class.\n- Expected count for dark green:\n$$E_{DG} = N \\times P_{DG} = 400 \\times \\frac{9}{16} = 25 \\times 9 = 225$$\n- Expected count for pale green:\n$$E_{PG} = N \\times P_{PG} = 400 \\times \\frac{3}{16} = 25 \\times 3 = 75$$\n- Expected count for colorless:\n$$E_{C} = N \\times P_{C} = 400 \\times \\frac{4}{16} = 100$$\n\nA check confirms the sum of expected counts equals the total sample size: $225 + 75 + 100 = 400$.\n\nThe Pearson chi-square statistic is defined as:\n$$\\chi^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$$\nwhere $k$ is the number of phenotypic classes, $O_i$ is the observed count for class $i$, and $E_i$ is the expected count for class $i$.\n\nWe calculate the contribution of each class to the $\\chi^2$ value:\n- For dark green:\n$$\\frac{(O_{DG} - E_{DG})^2}{E_{DG}} = \\frac{(210 - 225)^2}{225} = \\frac{(-15)^2}{225} = \\frac{225}{225} = 1.0$$\n- For pale green:\n$$\\frac{(O_{PG} - E_{PG})^2}{E_{PG}} = \\frac{(90 - 75)^2}{75} = \\frac{(15)^2}{75} = \\frac{225}{75} = 3.0$$\n- For colorless:\n$$\\frac{(O_{C} - E_{C})^2}{E_{C}} = \\frac{(100 - 100)^2}{100} = \\frac{0^2}{100} = 0.0$$\n\nThe total chi-square statistic is the sum of these values:\n$$\\chi^2 = 1.0 + 3.0 + 0.0 = 4.0$$\n\nTo determine if the deviation is statistically significant, we compare the calculated $\\chi^2$ value to the critical value from the chi-square distribution.
