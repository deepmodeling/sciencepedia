It describes a standard scenario in transmission genetics (dihybrid cross with epistasis) and applies a correct statistical procedure (Pearson's chi-square test). The provided data are internally consistent ($147+13=160$), and the question is structured to permit a unique, verifiable solution. The problem is free of logical contradictions, factual errors, or ambiguity. The instruction not to estimate parameters from the data is a crucial and correct constraint for testing a *theoretically derived* Mendelian ratio.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Expected Phenotypic Ratio**\nThe analysis begins with the F1 generation, which has the genotype $Aa\\,Bb$. These individuals are heterozygous at both loci. According to Mendel’s law of segregation, each F1 individual produces gametes containing one allele from each locus. According to Mendel's law of independent assortment, the alleles for the two loci assort into gametes independently. Therefore, an F1 individual with genotype $Aa\\,Bb$ produces four types of gametes in equal proportions: $AB$, $Ab$, $aB$, and $ab$. The probability for each gamete type is $P(AB) = P(Ab) = P(aB) = P(ab) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nTo obtain the F2 generation, the F1 generation is self-crossed ($Aa\\,Bb \\times Aa\\,Bb$). The resulting genotypic frequencies in the F2 can be determined using a Punnett square, which combines the gametes from both parents. The probability of any specific F2 genotype is the product of the probabilities of the constituent gametes. The resulting genotypes and their proportions follow the standard dihybrid ratio of $9:3:3:1$:\n-   $P(A\\_B\\_)$ (at least one dominant allele at both loci): $\\frac{9}{16}$\n-   $P(A\\_bb)$ (at least one dominant $A$, homozygous recessive $b$): $\\frac{3}{16}$\n-   $P(aaB\\_)$ (homozygous recessive $a$, at least one dominant $B$): $\\frac{3}{16}$\n-   $P(aabb)$ (homozygous recessive at both loci): $\\frac{1}{16}$\nThe sum of these probabilities is $\\frac{9}{16} + \\frac{3}{16} + \\frac{3}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{16}{16} = 1$, as expected.\n\nThe problem states a model of duplicate dominant epistasis. Under this model, the presence of a single dominant allele at *either* locus is sufficient to produce phenotype $P$. Only the double homozygous recessive genotype, $aa\\,bb$, produces the alternative phenotype $p$.\n-   The probability of an F2 individual expressing phenotype $P$ is the sum of the probabilities of all genotypes containing at least one dominant allele:\n    $$P(P) = P(A\\_B\\_) + P(A\\_bb) + P(aaB\\_) = \\frac{9}{16} + \\frac{3}{16} + \\frac{3}{16} = \\frac{15}{16}$$\n    Alternatively, and more directly, $P(P) = 1 - P(aabb) = 1 - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{15}{16}$.\n-   The probability of an F2 individual expressing phenotype $p$ is the probability of the double recessive genotype:\n    $$P(p) = P(aabb) = \\frac{1}{16}$$\nThus, the expected phenotypic ratio for $P:p$ under duplicate dominant epistasis is $15:1$.\n\n**Calculation of Expected Counts and Chi-Square Test**\nThe null hypothesis ($H_0$) is that the observed data conform to the $15\\!:\\!1$ phenotypic ratio derived from the model of duplicate dominant epistasis.\nGiven a total sample size of $n=160$ individuals, the expected counts ($E$) for each phenotypic class are:\n-   Expected count for phenotype $P$: $E_P = n \\times P(P) = 160 \\times \\frac{15}{16} = 10 \\times 15 = 150$.\n-   Expected count for phenotype $p$: $E_p = n \\times P(p) = 160 \\times \\frac{1}{16} = 10 \\times 1 = 10$.\n\nThe observed counts ($O$) are given as $O_P = 147$ and $O_p = 13$.\n\nThe Pearson chi-square test statistic ($\\chi^2$) is calculated using the formula:\n$$\\chi^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$$\nwhere $k$ is the number of phenotypic classes. In this case, $k=2$.\n\nApplying the formula to our data:\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{(O_P - E_P)^2}{E_P} + \\frac{(O_p - E_p)^2}{E_p}$$\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{(147 - 150)^2}{150} + \\frac{(13 - 10)^2}{10}$$\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{(-3)^2}{150} + \\frac{(3)^2}{10}$$\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{9}{150} + \\frac{9}{10}$$\n$$\\chi^2 = 0.06 + 0.9 = 0.96$$\n\n**Degrees of Freedom**\nThe degrees of freedom ($df$) for a goodness-of-fit test are given by $df = k - 1 - m$, where $k$ is the number of categories and $m$ is the number of parameters estimated from the data to generate the expected values.\nIn this problem, there are $k=2$ phenotypic classes ($P$ and $p$). The expected proportions ($15/16$ and $1/16$) were derived *a priori* from fundamental Mendelian principles, not estimated from the observed data. Therefore, the number of estimated parameters is $m=0$.\nThe correct degrees of freedom for this test are:\n$$df = 2 - 1 - 0 = 1$$\n\n**Final Calculation**\nThe calculated value of the chi-square statistic is $\\chi^2 = 0.96$.
