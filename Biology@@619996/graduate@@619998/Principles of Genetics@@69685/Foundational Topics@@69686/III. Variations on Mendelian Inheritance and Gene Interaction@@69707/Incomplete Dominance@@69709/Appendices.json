The predictable 1:2:1 phenotypic ratio from a monohybrid cross is the hallmark of incomplete dominance, but real-world data rarely fits this expectation perfectly due to random chance. This exercise invites you to step into the role of an experimental geneticist, using the chi-square ($\\chi^2$) test to statistically determine if observed experimental outcomes provide a 'good fit' for the incomplete dominance hypothesis [@problem_id:1498912]. Mastering this statistical tool is essential for validating genetic models and interpreting experimental results.", "problem": "A geneticist is studying a newly discovered species of bioluminescent fungus, *Luminomyces spectabilis*. The color of the light emitted by this fungus is determined by a single gene with two alleles. The allele $B$ is associated with bright blue light, and the allele $G$ is associated with glowing green light. The geneticist observes that when a pure-breeding blue-light fungus is crossed with a pure-breeding green-light fungus, all offspring emit an aqua-colored light. This suggests a pattern of incomplete dominance.\n\nTo investigate this further, the geneticist performs a cross between two fungi that both exhibit the aqua-colored bioluminescence. A total of 1000 spores from this cross are germinated and their phenotypes are recorded. The observed counts are: 228 fungi emitting bright blue light, 535 emitting aqua light, and 237 emitting glowing green light.\n\nTo test the hypothesis that this trait follows a simple Mendelian pattern of incomplete dominance, the researcher performs a chi-square ($\\chi^2$) test.

Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the calculation of the chi-square ($\\chi^2$) statistic to test if the observed offspring counts are consistent with the hypothesis of incomplete dominance.\n\nFirst, we must establish the null hypothesis ($H_0$). The null hypothesis is that the trait for bioluminescence color is controlled by a single gene with two alleles showing incomplete dominance, and that the observed phenotypic distribution in the offspring is statistically consistent with the expected Mendelian ratio for the given cross.\n\nNext, we determine the genotypes of the parents and the expected phenotypic ratio of the offspring. The problem states that the cross is between two fungi that both exhibit the aqua-colored phenotype. In incomplete dominance, the intermediate phenotype (aqua) corresponds to the heterozygous genotype. Therefore, both parents have the genotype $BG$.\n\nThe cross is $BG \\times BG$. We can use a Punnett square to determine the expected genotypic and phenotypic ratios of the offspring:\n- Genotypes: 1 $BB$ : 2 $BG$ : 1 $GG$\n- Phenotypes: 1 Bright Blue : 2 Aqua : 1 Glowing Green\n\nThe total number of offspring is $228 + 535 + 237 = 1000$.\n\nUsing the expected 1:2:1 ratio, we can calculate the expected number of offspring for each phenotype out of the total of 1000:\n- Expected number of Bright Blue offspring = $\\frac{1}{4} \\times 1000 = 250$\n- Expected number of Aqua offspring = $\\frac{2}{4} \\times 1000 = 500$\n- Expected number of Glowing Green offspring = $\\frac{1}{4} \\times 1000 = 250$\n\nNow, we can calculate the chi-square statistic using the formula:\n$$ \\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(\\text{Observed} - \\text{Expected})^2}{\\text{Expected}} $$\n\nWe apply this formula for each phenotypic category:\n1.
