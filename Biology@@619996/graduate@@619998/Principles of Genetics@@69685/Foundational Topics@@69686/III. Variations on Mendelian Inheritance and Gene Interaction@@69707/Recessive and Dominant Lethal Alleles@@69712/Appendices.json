It is a standard problem in transmission genetics involving viability selection. We will proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe problem describes a cross between a heterozygous parent of genotype $Aa$ and a homozygous wild-type parent of genotype $aa$. The allele $A$ is a dominant lethal with complete penetrance in the offspring generation, while $a$ is the wild-type allele.\n\nFirst, we determine the frequency of gametes produced by each parent based on Mendel's law of segregation.\nThe heterozygous parent, with genotype $Aa$, produces two types of gametes, $A$ and $a$, in equal proportions. The frequency of each gamete type is therefore $1/2$.\n$$f(A) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$f(a) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThe homozygous parent, with genotype $aa$, produces only one type of gamete, $a$. The frequency is $1$.\n$$f(a) = 1$$\n\nNext, we establish the expected genotypic frequencies among the zygotes at conception by considering the random fusion of these gametes. This can be visualized with a Punnett square or calculated directly from gamete frequencies.\n\nThe cross is $Aa \\times aa$.\nThe possible zygotic genotypes are $Aa$ and $aa$.\nThe frequency of zygotes with genotype $Aa$, denoted $p_{Aa}^{(\\mathrm{zygote})}$, is the product of the frequency of the $A$ gamete from the heterozygous parent and the $a$ gamete from the homozygous parent:\n$$p_{Aa}^{(\\mathrm{zygote})} = f(A)_{\\text{parent 1}} \\times f(a)_{\\text{parent 2}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThe frequency of zygotes with genotype $aa$, denoted $p_{aa}^{(\\mathrm{zygote})}$, is the product of the frequency of the $a$ gamete from the heterozygous parent and the $a$ gamete from the homozygous parent:\n$$p_{aa}^{(\\mathrm{zygote})} = f(a)_{\\text{parent 1}} \\times f(a)_{\\text{parent 2}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThe initial distribution of genotypes among all conceptions (zygotes) is $1/2$ for $Aa$ and $1/2$ for $aa$. The sum of these frequencies is $p_{Aa}^{(\\mathrm{zygote})} + p_{aa}^{(\\mathrm{zygote})} = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1$.\n\nNow, we apply the process of viability selection. The problem states that the dominant allele $A$ is lethal with complete penetrance, causing death before birth. This means any zygote carrying at least one $A$ allele will not survive. We define the viability, $v$, for each genotype:\n- For genotype $Aa$, viability $v_{Aa} = 0$.\n- For genotype $aa$ (wild-type), viability $v_{aa} = 1$.\n\nThe fraction of total conceptions that survive to birth, $s$, is the sum of the initial zygotic frequencies multiplied by their respective viabilities.\n$$s = (p_{Aa}^{(\\mathrm{zygote})} \\times v_{Aa}) + (p_{aa}^{(\\mathrm{zygote})} \\times v_{aa})$$\n$$s = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 0\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1\\right) = 0 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThus, the expected fraction of all conceptions that survive to birth is $s = 1/2$.\n\nFinally, we compute the expected genotype distribution among the live-born offspring. The frequency of a given genotype among the survivors is its surviving fraction (initial frequency times viability) divided by the total survival fraction, $s$.\n\nThe expected frequency of genotype $aa$ among live-born offspring, $p_{aa}^{(\\mathrm{live})}$, is:\n$$p_{aa}^{(\\mathrm{live})} = \\frac{p_{aa}^{(\\mathrm{zygote})} \\times v_{aa}}{s} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 1$$\n\nThe expected frequency of genotype $Aa$ among live-born offspring, $p_{Aa}^{(\\mathrm{live})}$, is:\n$$p_{Aa}^{(\\mathrm{live})} = \\frac{p_{Aa}^{(\\mathrm{zygote})} \\times v_{Aa}}{s} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\times 0}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 0$$\n\nAll live-born offspring will have the genotype $aa$. The required values are $p_{aa}^{(\\mathrm{live})} = 1$, $p_{Aa}^{(\\mathrm{live})} = 0$, and $s = 1/2$.

A female who is a heterozygous carrier has genotype $X^{A}X^{a}$ and mates with an unrelated male of genotype $X^{A}Y$ who is free of the lethal allele. Assume the following fundamental principles and conditions grounded in Mendelian genetics and viability selection:\n- By Mendel’s law of segregation and random assortment of sex chromosomes in meiosis, the mother produces $X^{A}$ and $X^{a}$ ova with equal probability $1/2$, and the father produces $X^{A}$ and $Y$ sperm with equal probability $1/2$.\n- Fertilization is random with respect to gamete type, so zygote genotype frequencies at conception follow the product rule of independent events.\n- The lethal allele $a$ is fully penetrant and lethal only when expressed (that is, in hemizygous males $X^{a}Y$ and in homozygous females $X^{a}X^{a}$).

It is a standard problem in population genetics that can be solved directly from the principles provided.\n\nThe objective is to derive the expected sex ratio, defined as the male-to-female ratio ($M/F$), among live births resulting from the specified mating. The mating is between a heterozygous carrier female of genotype $X^{A}X^{a}$ and a wild-type male of genotype $X^{A}Y$. The allele $a$ is a recessive, X-linked lethal. All lethality occurs before birth.\n\nFirst, we must establish the frequencies of gametes produced by each parent, as per the law of segregation.\nThe female parent has genotype $X^{A}X^{a}$. She produces two types of ova in equal proportions:\n- Ova with allele $X^{A}$: probability $P(X^{A}_{\\text{ova}}) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- Ova with allele $X^{a}$: probability $P(X^{a}_{\\text{ova}}) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nThe male parent has genotype $X^{A}Y$.

The frequency of each zygote genotype is the product of the probabilities of the constituent gametes. We can construct a Punnett square to systematically determine these frequencies.\n\n1.  Zygote genotype $X^{A}X^{A}$ (female) results from the fusion of an $X^{A}$ ovum and an $X^{A}$ sperm.\n    $P(X^{A}X^{A}) = P(X^{A}_{\\text{ova}}) \\times P(X^{A}_{\\text{sperm}}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n    This individual is homozygous dominant and is viable.\n\n2.

As the allele $a$ is recessive, she is phenotypically normal (a carrier) and is viable.\n\n3.  Zygote genotype $X^{A}Y$ (male) results from the fusion of an $X^{A}$ ovum and a $Y$ sperm.\n    $P(X^{A}Y) = P(X^{A}_{\\text{ova}}) \\times P(Y_{\\text{sperm}}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n    This individual is hemizygous for the wild-type allele and is viable.\n\n4.

The problem states the allele is lethal when expressed. In a hemizygous male, the allele on the single X chromosome is always expressed. Therefore, this genotype is subject to lethality. As all lethality occurs prior to birth, individuals with genotype $X^{a}Y$ do not survive. This directly accounts for why no affected sons are expected among live births.\n\nNow, we calculate the proportions of viable offspring, which constitute the population of live births. The initial proportions of zygotes at conception are:\n- Females: $P(\\text{female}) = P(X^{A}X^{A}) + P(X^{A}X^{a}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$. All female zygotes are viable.\n- Males: $P(\\text{male}) = P(X^{A}Y) + P(X^{a}Y) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nLet $F$ be the proportion of females among live births and $M$ be the proportion of males among live births. These are proportional to the frequencies of the viable genotypes calculated previously.\nThe total frequency of viable female zygotes is $P(\\text{live female}) = P(X^{A}X^{A}) + P(X^{A}X^{a}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe total frequency of viable male zygotes is $P(\\text{live male}) = P(X^{A}Y) = \\frac{1}{4}$, because the $X^{a}Y$ genotype is lethal.\n\nThe sex ratio is defined as the ratio of males to females among live births, $M/F$. This is equivalent to the ratio of their expected frequencies.\n$$\n\\text{Sex Ratio} = \\frac{M}{F} = \\frac{P(\\text{live male})}{P(\\text{live female})}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived frequencies:\n$$\n\\frac{M}{F} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{2}{1} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe expected sex ratio among live births is $1$ male for every $2$ females.\nThe analysis is complete and is based solely on the principles provided in the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "2844825"}, {"introduction": "A central task in genetics is to infer underlying biological parameters, such as the recombination fraction between linked genes, from experimental data.

It describes a standard scenario in transmission genetics involving linkage, recombination, and selection in the form of a lethal allele. The task is to derive a maximum likelihood estimate, a fundamental procedure in statistical genetics. The provided information is self-contained and sufficient for deriving a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid and I will proceed with its resolution.\n\nThe starting point for this analysis is the set of probabilities for the four potential progeny classes arising from a testcross of an $F_{1}$ individual with genotype $A B / a b$. The gametes produced by this $F_{1}$ parent are of four types. The parental, or nonrecombinant, gametes are $A B$ and $a b$. The recombinant gametes are $A b$ and $a B$. The recombination fraction, $\\theta$, is the proportion of gametes that are recombinant. By definition, the total frequency of recombinant gametes is $\\theta$, and the total frequency of nonrecombinant gametes is $1-\\theta$. Assuming no segregation distortion, each specific gamete type within a class (recombinant or nonrecombinant) is equally probable.\n\nThus, the frequencies of the four gamete types from the $A B / a b$ parent are:\n- $P(AB \\text{ gamete}) = \\frac{1-\\theta}{2}$\n- $P(ab \\text{ gamete}) = \\frac{1-\\theta}{2}$\n- $P(Ab \\text{ gamete}) = \\frac{\\theta}{2}$\n- $P(aB \\text{ gamete}) = \\frac{\\theta}{2}$\n\nThe testcross parent is of genotype $a b / a b$ and produces only one type of gamete, $a b$, with probability $1$. The genotypes of the zygotic progeny are therefore determined solely by the gamete from the $F_{1}$ parent. The pre-selection probabilities of the four progeny genotypes are equal to the frequencies of the corresponding gamete from the $F_{1}$ parent:\n- $P(A B / a b) = \\frac{1-\\theta}{2}$\n- $P(a b / a b) = \\frac{1-\\theta}{2}$\n- $P(A b / a b) = \\frac{\\theta}{2}$\n- $P(a B / a b) = \\frac{\\theta}{2}$\nFor simplicity, we denote the phenotypes by the alleles from the $F_1$ parent: $AB$, $ab$, $Ab$, $aB$.\n\nThe problem states that the $Ab$ genotype is lethal. This means all individuals of this class die and are not observed. The sample space of observed progeny is therefore restricted to the three viable classes: $AB$, $ab$, and $aB$. To find the probabilities of observing these classes, we must condition on viability. The total probability of a zygote being viable is the sum of the probabilities of the viable genotypes:\n$$P(\\text{viable}) = P(AB) + P(ab) + P(aB) = \\frac{1-\\theta}{2} + \\frac{1-\\theta}{2} + \\frac{\\theta}{2} = 1 - \\theta + \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\frac{2-\\theta}{2}$$\nThe conditional probabilities, denoted $p_{phenotype}$, for the three viable phenotypes are:\n$$p_{AB} = P(AB | \\text{viable}) = \\frac{P(AB)}{P(\\text{viable})} = \\frac{(1-\\theta)/2}{(2-\\theta)/2} = \\frac{1-\\theta}{2-\\theta}$$\n$$p_{ab} = P(ab | \\text{viable}) = \\frac{P(ab)}{P(\\text{viable})} = \\frac{(1-\\theta)/2}{(2-\\theta)/2} = \\frac{1-\\theta}{2-\\theta}$$\n$$p_{aB} = P(aB | \\text{viable}) = \\frac{P(aB)}{P(\\text{viable})} = \\frac{\\theta/2}{(2-\\theta)/2} = \\frac{\\theta}{2-\\theta}$$\n\nWe are given the observed counts for these classes: $n_{AB}$, $n_{ab}$, and $n_{aB}$. The total number of observed, viable progeny is $N = n_{AB} + n_{ab} + n_{aB}$. The data follow a multinomial distribution with these probabilities.
