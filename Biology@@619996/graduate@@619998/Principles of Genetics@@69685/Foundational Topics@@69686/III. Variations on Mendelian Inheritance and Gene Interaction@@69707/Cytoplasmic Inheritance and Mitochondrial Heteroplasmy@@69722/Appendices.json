We will first perform a formal validation of the problem statement.\n\nStep 1: Extract Givens.\n- The heteroplasmy of the maternal oocyte is $p_m$, defined as the fraction of mitochondria carrying the mutant allele.\n- The donor oocyte is homoplasmic wild type.\n- The carryover fraction is $c$, the expected fraction of the total mitochondrial population in the embryo that is maternally derived.\n- The total mitochondrial population size in the embryo is $N$.\n- The number of maternally derived mitochondria is $cN$.\n- The number of donor-derived mitochondria is $(1-c)N$.\n- A maternally derived mitochondrion carries the mutant allele with probability $p_m$.

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and parameters ($p_m$, $c$, $N$) to derive the requested quantity. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and internally consistent; the assumptions, such as treating $c$ as a fixed fraction for the number of mitochondria ($cN$) after being defined as an expectation, are standard simplifications in such models to make the problem tractable. The problem is not trivial, as it requires the correct application of probability theory, specifically the linearity of expectation, to a biological context.\n\nVerdict: The problem is valid. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $H_{initial}$ be the random variable representing the initial heteroplasmy of the reconstructed embryo. By definition, heteroplasmy is the fraction of mitochondria that carry the mutant allele. Let $M$ be the total number of mutant mitochondria in the embryo. The total number of mitochondria is given as $N$. Thus,\n$$H_{initial} = \\frac{M}{N}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the expected initial heteroplasmy, $E[H_{initial}]$. Using the property of expectation where the expectation of a random variable scaled by a constant is the scaled expectation, we have:\n$$E[H_{initial}] = E\\left[\\frac{M}{N}\\right] = \\frac{1}{N} E[M]$$\nHere, $N$ is treated as a fixed constant representing the total population size.\n\nThe total number of mutant mitochondria, $M$, is the sum of mutant mitochondria from the maternal carryover and the donor oocyte. Let $M_{maternal}$ be the number of mutant mitochondria from the maternal source and $M_{donor}$ be the number from the donor source.\n$$M = M_{maternal} + M_{donor}$$\n\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected total number of mutants is the sum of the expectations from each source:\n$$E[M] = E[M_{maternal}] + E[M_{donor}]$$\n\nFirst, consider the donor contribution. The problem states that the donor oocyte is homoplasmic wild type, meaning it contains no mutant alleles. Therefore, the number of mutant mitochondria from the donor is deterministically zero.\n$$M_{donor} = 0$$\nConsequently, its expectation is also zero.\n$$E[M_{donor}] = 0$$\n\nNext, consider the maternal contribution. The number of maternally derived mitochondria is $cN$. For each of these mitochondria, the probability of carrying the mutant allele is $p_m$. Let us define an indicator random variable $X_i$ for each of the $i = 1, 2, ..., cN$ maternally derived mitochondria.\n$$\nX_i = \n\\begin{cases} \n1  \\text{if the } i\\text{-th maternal mitochondrion is mutant} \\\\\n0  \\text{if the } i\\text{-th maternal mitochondrion is wild type}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe problem states that the probability of being mutant is $p_m$. Thus, $P(X_i = 1) = p_m$. The expected value of an indicator variable is the probability of the event it indicates:\n$$E[X_i] = (1) \\cdot P(X_i = 1) + (0) \\cdot P(X_i = 0) = p_m$$\nThe total number of mutant mitochondria from the maternal source, $M_{maternal}$, is the sum of these indicator variables:\n$$M_{maternal} = \\sum_{i=1}^{cN} X_i$$\nUsing the linearity of expectation, we can find the expected number of maternal mutant mitochondria. The expectation of a sum is the sum of the expectations, regardless of whether the variables are independent.\n$$E[M_{maternal}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{cN} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{cN} E[X_i]$$\nSince $E[X_i] = p_m$ for all $i$, this sum becomes:\n$$E[M_{maternal}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{cN} p_m = (cN) \\cdot p_m$$\n\nNow, we can find the total expected number of mutant mitochondria, $E[M]$:\n$$E[M] = E[M_{maternal}] + E[M_{donor}] = cNp_m + 0 = cNp_m$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this result back into the expression for the expected initial heteroplasmy:\n$$E[H_{initial}] = \\frac{1}{N} E[M] = \\frac{1}{N} (cNp_m)$$\nThe total population size $N$ cancels out, yielding the final expression for the expected initial heteroplasmy as a function of only the carryover fraction $c$ and the maternal heteroplasmy $p_m$.\n$$E[H_{initial}] = cp_m$$\nThis result is intuitively correct: the expected fraction of mutants in the final population is the fraction of the population that comes from the maternal source ($c$) multiplied by the expected fraction of mutants within that source ($p_m$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{cp_m}$$", "id": "2803037"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the static, single-generation view of heteroplasmy, this practice explores its dynamic nature within an individual's tissues.

I will now provide the full solution.\n\n### Task 1: Derivation of the Deterministic Trajectory\nLet $N_m(t)$ and $N_w(t)$ be the number of mutant and wild-type mtDNA molecules in a cell at time $t$, respectively. The total number of molecules is constant, $N = N_m + N_w$. The heteroplasmy is $p(t) = N_m(t)/N$.\n\nIn a time interval $dt$, a fraction $k \\cdot dt$ of molecules are degraded and replaced.\nThe number of mutant molecules degraded is $k N_m dt$.\nThe total number of molecules replaced is $k N dt$.\nNew molecules are synthesized based on the existing templates. The mutant has a relative replication advantage of $1+s$. The probability that a newly synthesized molecule is of the mutant type is the fitness-weighted frequency of the mutant template:\n$$\nP(\\text{new is mutant}) = \\frac{(1+s)N_m}{(1+s)N_m + (1)N_w} = \\frac{(1+s)p}{(1+s)p + (1-p)} = \\frac{(1+s)p}{1+sp}\n$$\nThe number of new mutant molecules synthesized is $(kN) \\cdot P(\\text{new is mutant}) \\cdot dt$.\nThe rate of change of the number of mutant molecules is:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_m}{dt} = (\\text{synthesis rate}) - (\\text{degradation rate})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dN_m}{dt} = kN \\frac{(1+s)p}{1+sp} - kpN\n$$\nSince $N_m = pN$ and $N$ is constant, we can write the equation in terms of $p$:\n$$\nN \\frac{dp}{dt} = kN \\frac{(1+s)p}{1+sp} - kpN\n$$\nDividing by $N$ gives the differential equation for the heteroplasmy $p(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = k \\left( \\frac{(1+s)p}{1+sp} - p \\right) = k \\frac{(1+s)p - p(1+sp)}{1+sp} = k \\frac{p+sp-p-sp^2}{1+sp}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = \\frac{k s p(1-p)}{1+sp}\n$$\nThis is a separable ordinary differential equation.

A full numerical optimization would be complex. A standard and effective approach is to use a linearization of the dynamics, which is highly accurate for small selection coefficients ($s \\ll 1$), a common occurrence in biology.\n\nIf $s$ is small, the denominator $1+sp \\approx 1$. The dynamic equation simplifies to the standard logistic growth equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} \\approx ks p(1-p)\n$$\nThis equation is solved by applying a logit transformation, $y(t) = \\mathrm{logit}(p(t)) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p(t)}{1-p(t)}\\right)$. The solution is linear in time:\n$$\ny(t) = y(0) + kst\n$$\nOur model becomes $y(t_1) - y(t_0) = ks(t_1 - t_0)$. Let $\\beta = ks$ be a composite parameter representing the effective selection rate. Then $y_1 - y_0 = \\beta t_1$ since $t_0=0$.\n\nNow, we obtain estimates for the quantities in this linearized model from the data.\nThe binomial sampling proportions are estimated as $\\hat{p}_0 = m_0/n_0$ and $\\hat{p}_1 = m_1/n_1$. Due to the large sample sizes ($n_0, n_1 \\gg 1$), the distributions of these estimators are well-approximated by Gaussians, with variances $\\sigma_{p_i}^2 = \\frac{\\hat{p_i}(1-\\hat{p_i})}{n_i}$.\n\nWe transform these estimates into the logit scale: $\\hat{y}_0 = \\mathrm{logit}(\\hat{p}_0)$ and $\\hat{y}_1 = \\mathrm{logit}(\\hat{p}_1)$. Using the delta method, the variance of these transformed estimates is $\\sigma_{y_i}^2 = (\\frac{d}{dp_i}\\mathrm{logit}(p_i)|_{\\hat{p}_i})^2 \\sigma_{p_i}^2 = (\\frac{1}{\\hat{p}_i(1-\\hat{p}_i)})^2 \\frac{\\hat{p_i}(1-\\hat{p_i})}{n_i} = \\frac{1}{n_i\\hat{p}_i(1-\\hat{p}_i)}$.\n\nFrom the sequencing data, we can form an estimate for the change in logit, $\\Delta \\hat{y} = \\hat{y}_1 - \\hat{y}_0$. Since the measurements are independent, its variance is $\\sigma_{\\Delta y}^2 = \\sigma_{y_0}^2 + \\sigma_{y_1}^2$. From the model $y_1-y_0 = \\beta t_1$, we obtain an estimate for $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta} = \\frac{\\hat{y}_1 - \\hat{y}_0}{t_1}\n$$\nThe variance of this estimator is $\\sigma_\\beta^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\Delta y}^2}{t_1^2} = \\frac{\\sigma_{y_0}^2 + \\sigma_{y_1}^2}{t_1^2}$.\nSo, the sequencing data provides one summary statistic: $\\hat{\\beta} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\beta, \\sigma_\\beta^2)$.\n\nWe have a second, independent piece of information from the isotope-labeling experiment: $k_{\\mathrm{obs}} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(k, \\sigma_k^2)$.\n\nWe can now write the joint log-likelihood for the parameters $k$ and $s$ based on these two derived, independent Gaussian observations:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(k, s) = \\ln P(\\hat{\\beta}|k,s) + \\ln P(k_{\\mathrm{obs}}|k) = \\text{const} - \\frac{(\\hat{\\beta} - ks)^2}{2\\sigma_\\beta^2} - \\frac{(k_{\\mathrm{obs}} - k)^2}{2\\sigma_k^2}\n$$\nTo find the maximum likelihood estimators $(\\hat{k}, \\hat{s})$, we set the partial derivatives of $\\mathcal{L}(k, s)$ to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial s} = - \\frac{2(\\hat{\\beta}-ks)(-k)}{2\\sigma_\\beta^2} = \\frac{k(\\hat{\\beta}-ks)}{\\sigma_\\beta^2} = 0\n$$\nSince $k$ is a turnover rate, $k > 0$, this implies $\\hat{\\beta} - \\hat{k}\\hat{s} = 0$, or $\\hat{k}\\hat{s} = \\hat{\\beta}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial k} = - \\frac{2(\\hat{\\beta}-ks)(-s)}{2\\sigma_\\beta^2} - \\frac{2(k_{\\mathrm{obs}}-k)(-1)}{2\\sigma_k^2} = \\frac{s(\\hat{\\beta}-ks)}{\\sigma_\\beta^2} + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{obs}}-k}{\\sigma_k^2} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the result from the first derivative, $\\hat{\\beta}-\\hat{k}\\hat{s}=0$, into the second equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\hat{s}(0)}{\\sigma_\\beta^2} + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{obs}}-\\hat{k}}{\\sigma_k^2} = 0 \\implies k_{\\mathrm{obs}} - \\hat{k} = 0\n$$\nThis gives the maximum likelihood estimators:\n$$\n\\hat{k} = k_{\\mathrm{obs}}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{s} = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{\\hat{k}} = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{k_{\\mathrm{obs}}} = \\frac{(\\hat{y}_1 - \\hat{y}_0)/t_1}{k_{\\mathrm{obs}}}\n$$\nThe intermediate parameters introduced are the point estimates of heteroplasmy ($\\hat{p}_0, \\hat{p}_1$), their logit-transformed counterparts ($\\hat{y}_0, \\hat{y}_1$), and the composite rate parameter $\\beta=ks$.

Map reads only to the mitochondrial contig to maximize sensitivity. Call heteroplasmy if, in the enriched library, VAF $\\ge 0.2\\%$ and at least $a_{e} \\ge 20$, regardless of discordant mates or insert size outliers, since enrichment already removes nuclear DNA. Ignore unenriched data to avoid NUMT confounding.\n\nC. Map to the combined reference and remove any read pair where either mate aligns to the nuclear genome. Call heteroplasmy if, in either library, VAF $\\ge 0.5\\%$, and require that all alternate-supporting read pairs have inferred insert sizes within $[\\mu - \\sigma,\\, \\mu + \\sigma] = [300,\\, 400]$ base pairs and no soft-clipping. Use no explicit statistical error model because mis-mapping has been filtered.\n\nD. Map to the combined reference and call heteroplasmy only if there are zero discordant mates among alternate-supporting read pairs in both unenriched and enriched libraries, VAF in the enriched library $\\ge 5\\%$, and insert sizes are within $[200,\\, 500]$ base pairs. This ensures maximal specificity by rejecting any locus with residual discordant signals.\n\nE. Map to the combined reference and focus on the circularity of mtDNA by requiring that a majority of alternate-supporting read pairs span the origin-of-replication boundary on the mtDNA contig with proper outward-facing orientation; if so, call heteroplasmy regardless of VAF and discordant mapping rates, because NUMTs lack circular topology.\n\nSelect the best option.", "solution": "The problem statement will first be subjected to rigorous validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe following data and definitions are provided verbatim:\n- **Sequencing Data**: Paired-end Illumina data.\n- **Read Length**: $150$ base pairs.\n- **Mean Insert Size**: $\\mu = 350$ base pairs.\n- **Insert Size Standard Deviation**: $\\sigma = 50$ base pairs.\n- **Libraries**:\n    1.

All concepts—paired-end sequencing, hybrid capture enrichment, VAF, discordant reads, insert size distribution, soft-clipping, binomial error models—are standard in the field. The provided data values are realistic for their respective experimental contexts.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly structured. It provides a comprehensive dataset from two distinct but related experiments (unenriched and enriched libraries) and asks for the evaluation of decision pipelines. A unique, best-justified answer can be determined by synthesizing the evidence according to established principles of genomic data analysis.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise and technical. All quantities are defined and measured. The principles listed are core tenets of sequence alignment and variant calling. There is no subjective or opinion-based content.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the invalidity flaws. It is self-contained, scientifically sound, and presents a non-trivial but solvable reasoning challenge rooted in real-world data analysis.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe central scientific task is to differentiate a true mitochondrial variant (heteroplasmy) from a nuclear pseudogene (NUMT) that is homologous to a region of the mtDNA. The provided data from two library types (unenriched WGS and mitochondrial-enriched) is the key to this distinction.\n\n**Analysis of Principles and Data**\n\n1.  **Role of the Combined Reference**: Aligning reads to a reference containing both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes is the correct fundamental approach. Reads originating from a NUMT have a correct location in the nuclear genome. If they mis-align to the mtDNA, their paired-end mate will often correctly map to the flanking nuclear DNA, thus flagging the pair as \"discordant\" (inter-chromosomal). This is a primary signal of a NUMT.\n\n2.  **Impact of Mitochondrial Enrichment**:\n    - If a variant is a true heteroplasmy, it is a feature of the mitochondrial population. Enriching for mitochondria should not significantly alter its Variant Allele Fraction (VAF).\n    - If a variant signal is solely due to a NUMT, the reads originate from the nuclear genome. As the mitochondrial genome is enriched, the relative proportion of reads from the nuclear genome decreases dramatically. Thus, the VAF of the NUMT-derived artifact should decrease upon enrichment.\n    - The data shows VAF constancy: $VAF_u = 0.008$ and $VAF_e \\approx 0.008125$. This strongly supports the presence of a true heteroplasmy at this level.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Artifact Signatures**:\n    - **Discordant/Nuclear Mates ($r$)**: In the unenriched data, $r_u = 0.35$ is extremely high. This indicates that a large fraction ($35\\%$) of the reads supporting the alternate allele originate from a different genomic context, classic for a NUMT. In the enriched data, $r_e = 0.003$, a drastic reduction of over $100$-fold. This value is below the provided baseline noise level of $r_0 = 0.005$, suggesting the NUMT signal has been effectively \"cleaned out\" by enrichment.\n    - **Insert Size Outliers ($q$)**: A NUMT insertion event can lead to mis-mapping where the inferred distance between read pairs on the mtDNA reference does not match the library's true fragment size distribution. The data shows $q_u = 0.28$, another very strong signal of mis-mapping. This drops to $q_e = 0.005$ in the enriched library, which is within the expected baseline range ($0.003$ to $0.010$) for a good library.\n    - **Soft-clipping ($s$)**: Soft-clipping at a variant site often indicates reads that span the junction of a structural variation, such as the insertion point of the NUMT in the nuclear genome. The high value of $s_u = 0.20$ is consistent with this, while the clean value of $s_e = 0.01$ indicates the enriched reads are mapping perfectly.\n\n4.  **Statistical Significance vs. Sequencing Error**: The VAF is low ($\\approx 0.8\\%$), so one must rule out sequencing error. The provided binomial model is the correct tool. For the enriched library, the expected number of error-based alternate reads is $E[X] = C_e \\times e = 80000 \\times 10^{-3} = 80$. The observed count is $a_e = 650$. This is significantly higher than expected by chance. Using a normal approximation to the binomial, the mean is $80$ and standard deviation is $\\sqrt{C_e e (1-e)} \\approx \\sqrt{80} \\approx 8.94$. The observed value of $650$ is more than $60$ standard deviations away from the mean, an astronomically improbable event under the null hypothesis of error alone. The signal is statistically significant.\n\n**Synthesis**: The data presents a complex but classic case: a true low-level heteroplasmy exists, and there is *also* a NUMT in the nuclear genome that carries the same variant nucleotide. The unenriched WGS library sequences both sources, leading to a high VAF with strong artifact signals (high $r_u$, $q_u$, $s_u$). The mitochondrial enrichment process purifies the mtDNA, effectively removing the NUMT-derived reads. The remaining signal in the enriched library is from the true heteroplasmy, which is why the VAF remains stable but the artifact metrics ($r_e$, $q_e$, $s_e$) drop to baseline noise levels. A robust decision pipeline must be able to correctly interpret this entire set of observations.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Map to the combined nuclear+mtDNA reference. Call heteroplasmy at a locus only if, in the mitochondrial-enriched library: (i) the alternate-allele count $a_{e}$ exceeds a Binomial tail threshold $k^{\\ast}$ defined by $\\Pr\\{X \\ge k^{\\ast}\\} \\le 10^{-6}$ for $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(C_{e}, e)$; (ii) the fraction of discordant or nuclear-mapped mates among alternate-supporting pairs satisfies $r_{e} \\le 0.01$ and shows at least a $20$-fold reduction relative to $r_{u}$; (iii) the insert-size outlier fraction $q_{e} \\le 0.01$, consistent with a $\\pm 3\\sigma$ envelope for a near-normal library; (iv) the enriched-library VAF agrees with the unenriched-library VAF within a relative difference of $\\le 25\\%$; and (v) strand bias is non-significant at $\\alpha = 0.01$. Do not require zero discordant pairs in unenriched data. Variants failing any of these filters are rejected as likely NUMTs or artifacts.**\n\nThis option outlines a comprehensive and scientifically sound pipeline.\n- It correctly uses the combined reference.\n- (i) It employs a proper statistical model to ensure the signal is not random error. The threshold ($10^{-6}$) is stringent and appropriate.\n- (ii) It sets a reasonable threshold for residual discordant mates in the enriched library ($r_e \\le 0.01$, consistent with the baseline $r_0=0.005$) and crucially uses the *relative reduction* from the unenriched data ($r_u$) to confirm the \"cleaning\" effect of enrichment.\n- (iii) It sets a sensible threshold on insert size outliers ($q_e \\le 0.01$), again consistent with the provided baseline for a good library.\n- (iv) It correctly identifies VAF stability between the two libraries as a key marker of true heteroplasmy. The $25\\%$ relative difference is a reasonable tolerance for experimental noise.\n- (v) It includes a standard check for strand bias.\n- The concluding statement \"Do not require zero discordant pairs in unenriched data\" correctly accommodates the NUMT+heteroplasmy scenario.\nThe given data satisfies every criterion in this pipeline, demonstrating its effectiveness.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Map reads only to the mitochondrial contig to maximize sensitivity. Call heteroplasmy if, in the enriched library, VAF $\\ge 0.2\\%$ and at least $a_{e} \\ge 20$, regardless of discordant mates or insert size outliers, since enrichment already removes nuclear DNA. Ignore unenriched data to avoid NUMT confounding.**\n\nThis option is fundamentally flawed.\n- \"Map reads only to the mitochondrial contig\" is incorrect. This is \"forced mapping\" and is a primary cause of NUMT artifacts, as it prevents NUMT-derived reads from mapping to their true nuclear origin.\n- \"regardless of discordant mates or insert size outliers\" is scientifically negligent. These are the most powerful indicators of mis-mapping and NUMTs.\n- \"Ignore unenriched data\" is also a grave error. The comparison between the two library types is essential for diagnosis.\n- The thresholds \"VAF $\\ge 0.2\\%$\" and \"$a_e \\ge 20$\" are arbitrary and not statistically justified based on depth and error rate.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Map to the combined reference and remove any read pair where either mate aligns to the nuclear genome. Call heteroplasmy if, in either library, VAF $\\ge 0.5\\%$, and require that all alternate-supporting read pairs have inferred insert sizes within $[\\mu - \\sigma,\\, \\mu + \\sigma] = [300,\\, 400]$ base pairs and no soft-clipping. Use no explicit statistical error model because mis-mapping has been filtered.**\n\nThis option contains multiple fallacies.\n- The insert size requirement of being within $\\pm 1\\sigma$ ($[\\mu-\\sigma, \\mu+\\sigma]$) is excessively strict. For a normal distribution, approximately $32\\%$ of data lies outside this range. This would generate an enormous number of false negatives. The problem itself uses $\\pm 3\\sigma$ as a more standard range.\n- The \"no soft-clipping\" rule is similarly too stringent; a zero-tolerance policy is brittle.\n- \"Use no explicit statistical error model\" is a critical omission. Even with perfect mapping, random sequencing errors can still generate false positive variants, especially at low VAFs.\n- The VAF threshold of $0.5\\%$ is arbitrary.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Map to the combined reference and call heteroplasmy only if there are zero discordant mates among alternate-supporting read pairs in both unenriched and enriched libraries, VAF in the enriched library $\\ge 5\\%$, and insert sizes are within $[200,\\, 500]$ base pairs. This ensures maximal specificity by rejecting any locus with residual discordant signals.**\n\nThis option proposes criteria that are too simplistic and overly stringent.\n- \"zero discordant mates... in both unenriched and enriched libraries\" is a fatal flaw. It would incorrectly reject the true heteroplasmy in the problem, as the presence of a NUMT guarantees discordant mates in the unenriched library ($r_u=0.35$). Even in the enriched library, a zero-tolerance policy ignores expected baseline noise ($r_0=0.005$).\n- \"VAF ... $\\ge 5\\%$\" is an arbitrary and very high threshold that would miss most real-world low-level heteroplasmies, including the one in this problem ($\\approx 0.8\\%$).\n- Requiring all insert sizes to be within $[200, 500]$ (i.e., $q=0$) is again a zero-tolerance policy that is too strict.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Map to the combined reference and focus on the circularity of mtDNA by requiring that a majority of alternate-supporting read pairs span the origin-of-replication boundary on the mtDNA contig with proper outward-facing orientation; if so, call heteroplasmy regardless of VAF and discordant mapping rates, because NUMTs lack circular topology.**\n\nThis option relies on a niche case and is not a general solution.\n- The test for read pairs spanning the linearization point of the circular genome is a valid technique, but it is only applicable to variants located in that specific region. It is not a general strategy for any locus.\n- \"regardless of VAF and discordant mapping rates\" is reckless. It ignores sequencing error (VAF) and the strongest, most general evidence of NUMTs (discordant mapping). A NUMT would certainly fail the circularity test, but many NUMT artifacts at loci far from the origin would be missed by this test and incorrectly called as heteroplasmy because other mapping quality metrics are being ignored.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2803119"}]}
