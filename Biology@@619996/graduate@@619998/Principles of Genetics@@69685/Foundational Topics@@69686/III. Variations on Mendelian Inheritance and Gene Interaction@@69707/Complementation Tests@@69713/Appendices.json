This first exercise provides a classic scenario where you must act as a genetic detective. By systematically analyzing which pairs of recessive mutants fail to complement each other, you can deduce the number of distinct genes responsible for a given phenotype, a fundamental step in dissecting any biological pathway [@problem_id:1478595].", "problem": "A geneticist is studying a biosynthetic pathway in the baker's yeast, *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. Seven independent, recessive, haploid mutant strains that are auxotrophic (unable to produce a required nutrient) have been isolated. These strains, labeled `mut1` through `mut7`, are unable to grow on a minimal medium (MM) but can grow if the medium is supplemented with the pathway's final product.\n\nTo determine how many different genes are represented by this collection of mutations, complementation tests are performed. Diploid cells are created by mating pairs of the haploid mutant strains. The resulting diploid's phenotype is then scored by its ability to grow on MM. Growth on MM indicates that complementation has occurred, while no growth indicates a failure to complement.\n\nAs expected, when any mutant strain is crossed with the wild-type strain, the resulting diploid grows on MM. Also, when any mutant strain is crossed with itself, the resulting diploid fails to grow on MM. The crucial results come from crosses between different mutant strains. The following pairs of different mutant strains failed to complement (i.e., the resulting diploid did not grow on MM):\n- `mut1` and `mut4`\n- `mut2` and `mut5`\n- `mut3` and `mut7`\n- `mut1` and `mut6`\n- `mut4` and `mut6`\n\nAll other pairwise crosses between different mutant strains resulted in complementation, meaning the diploid cells were able to grow on MM.\n\nBased on these results, how many distinct genes are represented by this collection of seven mutants?", "solution": "Principle: In a complementation test between recessive mutations, a diploid that grows on minimal medium indicates complementation, meaning the two mutations are in different genes (each gene has at least one functional copy). Failure to grow indicates failure to complement, meaning the two mutations are in the same gene (no functional copy is present for that gene in the diploid).\n\nApply the principle to the given non-complementing pairs:\n- mut1 fails with mut4 and with mut6; additionally, mut4 fails with mut6. By transitivity, mut1, mut4, and mut6 define one complementation group (one gene).\n- mut2 fails with mut5. This defines a second complementation group (a second gene).\n- mut3 fails with mut7. This defines a third complementation group (a third gene).\n\nThe statement that all other pairwise crosses complement confirms there are no further overlaps among these groups. Thus, the seven mutants partition into three distinct complementation groups corresponding to three different genes:\n- Gene A: mut1, mut4, mut6\n- Gene B: mut2, mut5\n- Gene C: mut3, mut7\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct genes represented is 3.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "1478595"}, {"introduction": "Real-world genetic analysis often presents results that can be interpreted in multiple ways. This practice challenges you to move beyond simple interpretation and into the realm of experimental design, a critical skill for any researcher [@problem_id:2801066]. You will learn to devise a set of experiments to unambiguously distinguish between two distinct genetic phenomena that can yield similar initial observations: non-complementation between alleles of the same gene and synthetic lethality between mutations in different genes.", "problem": "You are studying four Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast) haploid temperature-sensitive mutants, each carrying a single recessive mutation that abolishes function at the restrictive temperature but permits growth at the permissive temperature. The strains are $S_A^{(1)}$ with an allele $a^{ts1}$, $S_A^{(2)}$ with an allele $a^{ts2}$, $S_B$ with an allele $b^{ts}$, and $S_C$ with an allele $c^{ts}$. Each strain grows at $25^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ (permissive) and fails to grow at $37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ (restrictive). You suspect that $a^{ts1}$ and $a^{ts2}$ are alleles of the same gene (non-complementation in trans at $37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$), and that $b^{ts}$ and $c^{ts}$ reside in different genes that form a synthetic lethal pair at $25^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ (the haploid double mutant $b^{ts}c^{ts}$ is inviable at $25^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$). All alleles are fully recessive for loss of function at $37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ and behave as typical temperature-sensitive alleles at $25^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$.\n\nUsing foundational principles of complementation testing and tetrad analysis in yeast:\n- Complementation tests are performed by mating haploids to form diploids and assaying function under conditions where the mutant phenotype is revealed; if two recessive mutations are in different genes, the diploid heterozygous at both loci has at least one functional copy of each required gene and exhibits wild-type function (complementation). If they are in the same gene, the diploid trans-heteroallelic combination fails to restore function (non-complementation).\n- Synthetic lethality is defined as inviability of the double mutant when each single mutant is viable under the same condition. In yeast, synthetic lethality among two recessive mutations in different genes is typically detected after sporulation of a diploid heterozygous at both loci and dissection of tetrads, yielding a characteristic $2\\!:\\!2$ live:dead segregation at the permissive condition when only double-mutant spores die.\n\nYou will design a minimal and sufficient matrix of pairwise tests and specify the expected outcomes that unambiguously distinguish non-complementation (same gene) from synthetic lethality (different genes, double mutant inviable at $25^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$).

No temperature-shift phenotyping of diploids is required.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically sound and well-posed. It presents a classic scenario in yeast genetics, requiring the differentiation of two distinct genetic interactions: non-complementation between alleles of the same gene and synthetic lethality between mutations in different genes. The provided definitions and conditions are internally consistent and grounded in established principles of molecular genetics. We shall proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe fundamental task is to design an experimental protocol that unambiguously distinguishes non-complementation from synthetic lethality for the specified pairs of mutations. These two phenomena are detected through different assays.\n\n$1$. **Complementation Test**: This test assesses whether two recessive mutations reside in the same gene. It is performed on the diploid organism. Haploid yeast strains carrying the mutations are mated to form a diploid. This diploid is then phenotyped under the restrictive condition where the mutations are expressed.\n- If the mutations are in *different* genes (e.g., mutant $1$ is $m1/m1; M2/M2$ and mutant $2$ is $M1/M1; m2/m2$), the resulting diploid is heterozygous at both loci ($M1/m1; M2/m2$). It possesses one wild-type allele for each gene ($M1$ and $M2$) and will therefore exhibit the wild-type phenotype (in this case, growth at the restrictive temperature, $37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$). This outcome is called **complementation**.\n- If the mutations are alleles of the *same* gene (e.g., $m1$ and $m2$ are different mutant alleles of gene $M$), the diploid genotype is $m1/m2$. Since both alleles are non-functional at the restrictive temperature, the diploid lacks any functional copy of gene $M$ and will exhibit the mutant phenotype (failure to grow at $37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$). This is **non-complementation**.\n\n$2$. **Synthetic Lethality Test**: This test identifies cases where mutations in two different genes are individually viable but lethal in combination. The test begins with a diploid heterozygous for both mutations ($M1/m1; M2/m2$), which is viable. This diploid is then induced to sporulate, producing haploid spores through meiosis. The viability of these spores is assessed under a condition where the single mutants are viable (in this case, the permissive temperature, $25^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$).\n- In a standard cross between two unlinked genes with no interaction, four types of spores are produced in equal numbers: wild-type ($M1 M2$), two single mutants ($m1 M2$ and $M1 m2$), and the double mutant ($m1 m2$). If there is no synthetic lethality, all four spore types are viable at the permissive temperature, leading to tetrads with four viable spores (a $4:0$ live:dead ratio).\n- If the $m1$ and $m2$ mutations are **synthetically lethal**, the double mutant spore ($m1 m2$) will be inviable. This results in tetrads that predominantly contain only two viable spores (a $2:2$ live:dead ratio for non-parental ditype tetrads), as the two single-mutant spores survive but the double-mutant spores die. The wild-type spores also survive. The key signature is a significant proportion of asci with fewer than four viable spores, specifically a $2:2$ live:dead pattern at the permissive temperature.\n\nNow we apply these principles to the three specified pairings, assuming the initial suspicions are correct.\n\n**Pairing $1$: ($a^{ts1} \\times a^{ts2}$)**\n- **Hypothesis**: $a^{ts1}$ and $a^{ts2}$ are alleles of the same gene, let us call it gene $A$.\n- **Diploid Genotype**: Mating haploid $a^{ts1}$ with haploid $a^{ts2}$ creates a diploid of genotype $a^{ts1}/a^{ts2}$.\n- **Complementation Test**: At the restrictive temperature ($37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$), this diploid has no functional copy of gene $A$. Therefore, it will fail to grow. This is a classic case of **non-complementation**.\n- **Conclusion**: Observing diploid inviability at $37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ is sufficient to conclude allelism. No further testing (e.g., tetrad analysis) is required to answer this specific question.\n\n**Pairing $2$: ($a^{ts1} \\times b^{ts}$)**\n- **Hypothesis**: $a^{ts1}$ and $b^{ts}$ are in different, non-interacting genes (gene $A$ and gene $B$).\n- **Diploid Genotype**: Mating haploid $a^{ts1}$ (genotype $a^{ts1}; B^+$) with haploid $b^{ts}$ (genotype $A^+; b^{ts}$) creates a diploid of genotype $A^+/a^{ts1}; B^+/b^{ts}$.\n- **Complementation Test**: At $37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$, this diploid has a functional $A^+$ allele (from the $b^{ts}$ parent) and a functional $B^+$ allele (from the $a^{ts1}$ parent). It will therefore grow. This is **complementation**.\n- **Synthetic Lethality Test**: We sporulate this diploid and analyze tetrads at $25^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$. The spores are $A^+ B^+$, $a^{ts1} B^+$, $A^+ b^{ts}$, and $a^{ts1} b^{ts}$. Since there is no synthetic lethality, all four spore types are viable at the permissive temperature. The expected outcome is a $4:0$ live:dead ratio.\n\n**Pairing $3$: ($b^{ts} \\times c^{ts}$)**\n- **Hypothesis**: $b^{ts}$ and $c^{ts}$ are in different genes (gene $B$ and gene $C$) and are synthetically lethal at $25^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$.\n- **Diploid Genotype**: Mating haploid $b^{ts}$ (genotype $b^{ts}; C^+$) with haploid $c^{ts}$ (genotype $B^+; c^{ts}$) creates a diploid of genotype $B^+/b^{ts}; C^+/c^{ts}$.\n- **Complementation Test**: At $37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$, this diploid, like the one from the previous cross, has a functional copy of each gene ($B^+$ and $C^+$). It will exhibit **complementation** and grow.\n- **Synthetic Lethality Test**: We sporulate this diploid and analyze tetrads at $25^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$. The spores are $B^+ C^+$, $b^{ts} C^+$, $B^+ c^{ts}$, and $b^{ts} c^{ts}$. The hypothesis is that the double mutant $b^{ts} c^{ts}$ is inviable at $25^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$. Therefore, only the wild-type and single-mutant spores will form colonies. This leads to the characteristic signature of synthetic lethality: a **$2:2$ live:dead spore ratio** in non-parental ditype tetrads.\n\nBased on this analysis, the minimal and sufficient testing strategy is:\n$1$. Perform pairwise matings to create diploids.\n$2$. Test diploid growth at $37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$. Failure to grow indicates non-complementation (allelism). Growth indicates complementation (different genes).\n$3$. For pairs that complement, proceed to sporulate the diploid and dissect tetrads. Score spore viability at $25^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$. A $4:0$ live:dead ratio indicates no synthetic lethality. A $2:2$ live:dead ratio indicates synthetic lethality.\n\nWe now evaluate the given options.\n\n**A.** This option proposes to perform pairwise matings, assay diploid growth at $37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$, and for those that grow, perform tetrad analysis at $25^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$. This procedure is precisely the correct logical flow.\n- For ($a^{ts1} \\times a^{ts2}$), it correctly predicts diploid failure to grow at $37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ (non-complementation).\n- For ($a^{ts1} \\times b^{ts}$), it correctly predicts diploid growth at $37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ (complementation) and a subsequent $4:0$ live:dead tetrad pattern at $25^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$.\n- For ($b^{ts} \\times c^{ts}$), it correctly predicts diploid growth at $37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ followed by a $2:2$ live:dead tetrad pattern at $25^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$.\n- It also correctly includes a plasmid rescue experiment as a confirmatory control for synthetic lethality.\nThis option is entirely correct.\n\n**B.** This option proposes complementation tests at $25^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ and tetrad analysis at $37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$. This is fundamentally flawed.\n- A complementation test at the permissive temperature ($25^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$) is uninformative, as all strains (and therefore all diploids) are expected to grow.\n- A synthetic lethality test must be performed at a temperature where single mutants are viable, which is $25^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$. Testing spore viability at $37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ would confound the result, as all spores carrying any $ts$ allele would die, masking the specific lethality of the double mutant combination. The predicted ratios are also incorrect.\nThis option is scientifically incorrect.\n\n**C.** This option proposes using only diploid growth at $37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ and misinterprets the results. It claims that failure to grow indicates synthetic lethality. This is a severe conceptual error. Diploid inviability at the restrictive temperature indicates non-complementation. It also incorrectly predicts that the ($b^{ts} \\times c^{ts}$) diploid would fail to grow at $37^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$; as established, these mutations would complement, and the diploid would grow. The option conflates two distinct genetic phenomena.\nThis option is scientifically incorrect.\n\n**D.** This option proposes using recombination frequency to infer genetic interactions. While related, this is not the direct or standard method. Allelism is tested by complementation, not by absence of recombination. Synthetic lethality is most unambiguously detected by tetrad analysis of spore viability, not by measuring recombination frequency via random spore analysis, which can be confounded by linkage. Critically, this option completely omits the complementation test on the diploid at the restrictive temperature, which is essential for distinguishing allelic from non-allelic mutations.\nThis option proposes an inappropriate and insufficient methodology.\n\nTherefore, option A is the only one that describes a correct and complete experimental strategy with accurate predictions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2801066"}, {"introduction": "While many genetic problems are framed with binary outcomes, a deeper understanding often requires quantitative reasoning.

Assume the following fundamental base:\n\n- Gene products are subunits that assemble into complexes according to the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology (deoxyribonucleic acid to ribonucleic acid to protein), and the pool of subunits contributed by allele $a$ and allele $b$ is large, well-mixed, and assembles randomly.\n- The fraction of subunits in the pool encoded by allele $a$ is $p \\in [0,1]$, and the fraction encoded by allele $b$ is $1-p$.

Express your final answer as a single simplified analytic expression. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement must first be subjected to rigorous validation to ensure it is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed before a solution is attempted.\n\nThe provided givens are:\n- The protein complex is a homotetramer, meaning it has $4$ positions for subunits.\n- The subunits are encoded by a single locus in a diploid organism.\n- The organism carries two distinct mutant alleles, $a$ and $b$.\n- Subunits produced from only allele $a$ or only allele $b$ result in a nonfunctional complex.\n- Interallelic complementation occurs, restoring function if subunits from both $a$ and $b$ are present in the same tetramer.\n- The pool of subunits from which complexes assemble is large, well-mixed, and assembly is random.\n- The fraction of subunits encoded by allele $a$ is $p$, where $p \\in [0,1]$.\n- The fraction of subunits encoded by allele $b$ is $1-p$.\n- The filling of each of the $4$ positions is an independent event.\n- A complex is functional if and only if it contains at least one subunit from allele $a$ and at least one subunit from allele $b$.\n\nThis problem is a valid application of probability theory to a fundamental concept in genetics—interallelic complementation. The scenario is a standard, albeit simplified, model used in molecular genetics and is built on sound scientific principles (Central Dogma, protein assembly). It is well-posed, providing all necessary information to derive a unique mathematical solution. The language is objective and precise. There are no contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution may be derived.\n\nThe assembly of a $4$-subunit complex, where each position is filled independently from a large pool, constitutes a sequence of Bernoulli trials. Let a single trial be the selection of one subunit for one position in the tetramer. There are $n=4$ such independent trials.\n\nLet $A$ denote the event that a selected subunit is of type $a$, and $B$ denote the event that it is of type $b$. The problem gives the probabilities of these events as:\n$$ P(A) = p $$\n$$ P(B) = 1-p $$\n\nWe define a random variable $X$ to be the number of subunits of type $a$ in a randomly assembled tetramer. Since the $n=4$ trials are independent and the probability of success (selecting an $a$ subunit) is constant at $p$, $X$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n=4$ and $p$. We write this as $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n=4, p)$.\n\nThe probability mass function for $X$, which gives the probability of having exactly $k$ subunits of type $a$, is:\n$$ P(X=k) = \\binom{4}{k} p^{k} (1-p)^{4-k}, \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\} $$\nThe problem defines a functional complex as one containing at least one subunit from allele $a$ and at least one from allele $b$.\n- \"At least one subunit from allele $a$\" translates to $X \\ge 1$.\n- \"At least one subunit from allele $b$\" means the number of $b$ subunits, which is $4-X$, must be at least $1$. This is equivalent to $4-X \\ge 1$, which simplifies to $X \\le 3$.\n\nThus, a complex is functional if and only if $1 \\le X \\le 3$. The required fraction is the probability $P(1 \\le X \\le 3)$.\n\nWhile one could sum $P(X=1) + P(X=2) + P(X=3)$, it is more direct to use the complement rule. A complex is nonfunctional if it does not satisfy the condition for functionality. This occurs if the complex is composed exclusively of subunits of a single type. This corresponds to the cases where $X=0$ (all $4$ subunits are type $b$) or $X=4$ (all $4$ subunits are type $a$).\n\nThe fraction of functional tetramers is $1$ minus the fraction of nonfunctional tetramers:\n$$ P(\\text{functional}) = 1 - P(\\text{nonfunctional}) = 1 - [P(X=0) + P(X=4)] $$\nWe calculate the probabilities for the two nonfunctional cases using the binomial formula:\nThe probability of a complex with only type $b$ subunits ($k=0$) is:\n$$ P(X=0) = \\binom{4}{0} p^{0} (1-p)^{4-0} = (1-p)^{4} $$\nThe probability of a complex with only type $a$ subunits ($k=4$) is:\n$$ P(X=4) = \\binom{4}{4} p^{4} (1-p)^{4-4} = p^{4} $$\nThe total probability of a nonfunctional complex is the sum of these mutually exclusive events:\n$$ P(\\text{nonfunctional}) = p^{4} + (1-p)^{4} $$\nTherefore, the probability of a functional complex is:\n$$ P(\\text{functional}) = 1 - \\left( p^{4} + (1-p)^{4} \\right) $$\nTo arrive at the final simplified polynomial expression, we expand $(1-p)^{4}$ using the binomial theorem:\n$$ (1-p)^{4} = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} (1)^{4-k} (-p)^{k} = \\binom{4}{0}(1) - \\binom{4}{1}p + \\binom{4}{2}p^{2} - \\binom{4}{3}p^{3} + \\binom{4}{4}p^{4} $$\n$$ (1-p)^{4} = 1 - 4p + 6p^{2} - 4p^{3} + p^{4} $$\nNow, substitute this expansion back into the expression for the functional fraction:\n$$ P(\\text{functional}) = 1 - \\left[ p^{4} + (1 - 4p + 6p^{2} - 4p^{3} + p^{4}) \\right] $$\nCombine the terms inside the parentheses:\n$$ P(\\text{functional}) = 1 - (2p^{4} - 4p^{3} + 6p^{2} - 4p + 1) $$\nFinally, distribute the negative sign and simplify to obtain the closed-form expression:\n$$ P(\\text{functional}) = 1 - 2p^{4} + 4p^{3} - 6p^{2} + 4p - 1 $$\n$$ P(\\text{functional}) = -2p^{4} + 4p^{3} - 6p^{2} + 4p $$\nThis polynomial represents the expected fraction of assembled tetramers that are functional.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-2p^{4} + 4p^{3} - 6p^{2} + 4p}\n$$", "id": "2801115"}]}
