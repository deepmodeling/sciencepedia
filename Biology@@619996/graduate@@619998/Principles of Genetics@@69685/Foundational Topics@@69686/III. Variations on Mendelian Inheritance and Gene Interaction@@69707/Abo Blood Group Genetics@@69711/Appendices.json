This exercise explores the crucial concept of epistasis through the fascinating case of the Bombay phenotype [@problem_id:2772058]. By calculating the probability of this rare blood type in a family, you will see how the function of one gene, $FUT1$, is an absolute prerequisite for the expression of the ABO gene, providing a classic example of how gene interactions shape our traits.", "problem": "A couple is undergoing genetic counseling. The Alpha(1,2)-Fucosyltransferase 1 (FUT1) locus, which determines the presence of the H antigen required for red blood cell (RBC) ABO antigen expression, has two alleles: a functional dominant allele $H$ and a null recessive allele $h$. Individuals with genotype $hh$ lack the H antigen on RBCs and exhibit the Bombay phenotype, which masks any ABO blood group antigens that might otherwise be expressed. The ABO blood group system is determined at a separate locus with three common alleles: $I^{A}$, $I^{B}$, and $i$, where $I^{A}$ and $I^{B}$ are codominant and both are dominant to $i$. The parents are known to be heterozygous at FUT1, each with genotype $Hh$. At the ABO locus, the first parent has genotype $I^{A}i$ and the second parent has genotype $I^{B}i$. Assume Mendel’s laws of segregation and independent assortment apply (the FUT1 and ABO loci assort independently), there is complete penetrance of the Bombay phenotype for genotype $hh$, and no selection, mutation, or segregation distortion occurs. Under random segregation, what is the probability that a randomly conceived child of this couple will have the Bombay phenotype (i.e., be $hh$ at FUT1), irrespective of the child’s ABO genotype? Express your final answer as a reduced fraction. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for the probability that a child of the specified couple will exhibit the Bombay phenotype. The Bombay phenotype is defined by the genotype $hh$ at the Alpha(1,2)-Fucosyltransferase 1 (FUT1) locus. The problem explicitly states that the FUT1 locus and the ABO locus assort independently, according to Mendel's law of independent assortment. This principle dictates that the inheritance of one trait does not influence the inheritance of the other. Therefore, to determine the probability of the offspring's genotype at the FUT1 locus, we can analyze this locus in complete isolation from the ABO locus. The genotypes of the parents at the ABO locus ($I^{A}i$ and $I^{B}i$) are extraneous information for the specific question posed.\n\nThe parental genotypes at the FUT1 locus are both given as heterozygous, which is $Hh$. Thus, the genetic cross to consider is $Hh \\times Hh$.\n\nAccording to Mendel’s law of segregation, each parent will produce gametes carrying either the $H$ allele or the $h$ allele with equal probability. For each parent, the probability of producing a gamete with the $H$ allele is $P(H) = \\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of producing a gamete with the $h$ allele is $P(h) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTo find the probability of the offspring having the genotype $hh$, we must consider the event that the child inherits an $h$ allele from the first parent AND an $h$ allele from the second parent. Since the gamete contribution from each parent is an independent event, we can multiply their probabilities.\n\nThe probability of inheriting an $h$ allele from the first parent is $P(\\text{parent}_1 \\to h) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe probability of inheriting an $h$ allele from the second parent is $P(\\text{parent}_2 \\to h) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability of an offspring having the genotype $hh$ is the product of these individual probabilities:\n$$P(hh) = P(\\text{parent}_1 \\to h) \\times P(\\text{parent}_2 \\to h) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nThis result can also be visualized using a Punnett square for the monohybrid cross $Hh \\times Hh$. The possible genotypes of the offspring are $HH$, $Hh$, and $hh$. The Punnett square yields the following genotypic ratio: $1$ part $HH$, $2$ parts $Hh$, and $1$ part $hh$. The total number of possible outcomes is $4$.\nThe probability for each genotype is:\n$P(HH) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n$P(Hh) = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$P(hh) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThe question asks for the probability of the child having the Bombay phenotype, which corresponds to the genotype $hh$.

The ABO blood group system (ABO) is determined by three alleles, $I^{A}$, $I^{B}$, and $i$, where $I^{A}$ and $I^{B}$ are codominant and $i$ is recessive. Under Mendelian inheritance and Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), genotype frequencies within each deme are given by the standard multinomial expansion for three alleles.
