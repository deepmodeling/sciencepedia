The objective is to derive the expected genotype-to-phenotype segregation ratios, and then compute the expected counts of the two phenotypic classes in a sample of $N$ offspring as closed-form expressions in terms of $p$ and $N$.\n\nNext, I will validate the problem.\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. It utilizes fundamental concepts of Mendelian genetics, including segregation, dominance, and the backcross. The introduction of incomplete penetrance, represented by the parameter $p$, is a standard concept in quantitative and medical genetics. The problem is well-posed; it provides all necessary information and probabilistic assumptions to uniquely determine the expected values requested. The language is objective and precise, using standard terminology without ambiguity. The problem does not violate any scientific principles, is not based on false premises, is not metaphorical, and is directly relevant to the principles of genetics. The setup is complete and consistent, and the conditions are scientifically plausible. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows.\n\nLet $G$ denote the genotype of an offspring and $\\Phi$ denote its phenotype. The possible genotypes for an offspring from the cross $Aa \\times aa$ are $Aa$ and $aa$. The possible phenotypes are dominant and recessive.\n\nStep 1: Determine the probabilities of offspring genotypes.\nThe parent with genotype $Aa$ produces two types of gametes, $A$ and $a$. According to the law of segregation, the probabilities of these gametes are $P(\\text{gamete}=A) = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $P(\\text{gamete}=a) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe parent with genotype $aa$ produces only one type of gamete, $a$, with probability $P(\\text{gamete}=a) = 1$.\n\nThe genotype of an offspring is determined by the fusion of one gamete from each parent.\nThe probability of an offspring having the genotype $Aa$ is:\n$$P(G=Aa) = P(\\text{gamete from Aa is A}) \\times P(\\text{gamete from aa is a}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe probability of an offspring having the genotype $aa$ is:\n$$P(G=aa) = P(\\text{gamete from Aa is a}) \\times P(\\text{gamete from aa is a}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe expected genotypic ratio among offspring is $1$ $Aa$ : $1$ $aa$. The sum of probabilities is $P(G=Aa) + P(G=aa) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$, as required.\n\nStep 2: Determine the probabilities of offspring phenotypes.\nThe probability of observing a particular phenotype is determined by the genotype probabilities and the penetrance values. Let $\\Phi_D$ be the dominant phenotype and $\\Phi_R$ be the recessive phenotype.\nThe conditional probabilities (penetrance values) given in the problem are:\n- $P(\\Phi_D | G=Aa) = p$\n- $P(\\Phi_R | G=aa) = 1$\n\nFrom these, we can deduce the complementary probabilities:\n- The genotype $Aa$ can express either the dominant or recessive phenotype. Thus, $P(\\Phi_R | G=Aa) = 1 - P(\\Phi_D | G=Aa) = 1 - p$.\n- For genotype $aa$, $P(\\Phi_D | G=aa) = 1 - P(\\Phi_R | G=aa) = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n\nWe use the law of total probability to find the unconditional probabilities of each phenotype.\nThe probability of an offspring exhibiting the dominant phenotype, $P(\\Phi_D)$, is:\n$$P(\\Phi_D) = P(\\Phi_D | G=Aa)P(G=Aa) + P(\\Phi_D | G=aa)P(G=aa)$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$P(\\Phi_D) = p \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{p}{2}$$\n\nThe probability of an offspring exhibiting the recessive phenotype, $P(\\Phi_R)$, is:\n$$P(\\Phi_R) = P(\\Phi_R | G=Aa)P(G=Aa) + P(\\Phi_R | G=aa)P(G=aa)$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$P(\\Phi_R) = (1-p) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1-p}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1-p+1}{2} = \\frac{2-p}{2}$$\nAs a consistency check, the sum of phenotype probabilities is $P(\\Phi_D) + P(\\Phi_R) = \\frac{p}{2} + \\frac{2-p}{2} = \\frac{p+2-p}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1$. The calculation is correct.\n\nStep 3: Compute the expected counts in a sample of $N$ offspring.\nFor a total of $N$ offspring, where each offspring's phenotype is an independent trial, the number of offspring with a given phenotype follows a binomial distribution. Let $X_D$ be the random variable for the count of offspring with the dominant phenotype, and $X_R$ be the random variable for the count of offspring with the recessive phenotype.\nThe expected value of a binomially distributed variable with $N$ trials and success probability $q$ is $Nq$.\n\nThe expected number of offspring with the dominant phenotype, $E[X_D]$, is:\n$$E[X_D] = N \\cdot P(\\Phi_D) = N \\cdot \\frac{p}{2} = \\frac{Np}{2}$$\n\nThe expected number of offspring with the recessive phenotype, $E[X_R]$, is:\n$$E[X_R] = N \\cdot P(\\Phi_R) = N \\cdot \\frac{2-p}{2} = \\frac{N(2-p)}{2}$$\nThe sum of the expected counts is $E[X_D] + E[X_R] = \\frac{Np}{2} + \\frac{N(2-p)}{2} = \\frac{Np + 2N - Np}{2} = \\frac{2N}{2} = N$, which is the total number of offspring, as expected.\n\nThe final answer is a two-entry row vector containing the expected number of offspring with the dominant phenotype followed by the expected number with the recessive phenotype.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{Np}{2} & \\frac{N(2-p)}{2} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2806402"}, {"introduction": "Beyond individual crosses, understanding the contribution of a locus to trait variation across an entire population is a central goal of quantitative genetics.

It represents a standard exercise in quantitative genetics based on Fisher's model of variance partitioning. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of additive genetic variance, $V_{A}$, and dominance genetic variance, $V_{D}$, for a single diallelic locus in a population at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The total genetic variance, $V_{G}$, is the sum of these two components: $V_{G} = V_{A} + V_{D}$.\n\nThe givens are:\nAllele frequencies: $p = P(A) = 0.3$ and $q = P(a) = 1 - p = 0.7$.\nGenotypic values: $G_{AA} = 10$, $G_{Aa} = 7$, and $G_{aa} = 4$.\n\nUnder HWE, the frequencies of the genotypes are:\n$f(AA) = p^2 = (0.3)^2 = 0.09$\n$f(Aa) = 2pq = 2(0.3)(0.7) = 0.42$\n$f(aa) = q^2 = (0.7)^2 = 0.49$\n\nThe problem defines the additive effect based on the regression of genotypic value on the number of $A$ alleles, which we denote by $x \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. The genotypes $aa$, $Aa$, and $AA$ correspond to $x=0$, $x=1$, and $x=2$, respectively. Let $Y$ be the random variable for the genotypic value.\n\nFirst, we calculate the mean genotypic value of the population, $\\mu = E[Y]$:\n$$ \\mu = G_{aa} f(aa) + G_{Aa} f(Aa) + G_{AA} f(AA) $$\n$$ \\mu = (4)(0.49) + (7)(0.42) + (10)(0.09) = 1.96 + 2.94 + 0.90 = 5.8 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the total genetic variance, $V_{G} = \\text{Var}(Y) = E[Y^2] - (E[Y])^2$:\n$$ E[Y^2] = G_{aa}^2 f(aa) + G_{Aa}^2 f(Aa) + G_{AA}^2 f(AA) $$\n$$ E[Y^2] = (4^2)(0.49) + (7^2)(0.42) + (10^2)(0.09) = (16)(0.49) + (49)(0.42) + (100)(0.09) $$\n$$ E[Y^2] = 7.84 + 20.58 + 9.00 = 37.42 $$\n$$ V_{G} = 37.42 - (5.8)^2 = 37.42 - 33.64 = 3.78 $$\n\nThe additive genetic variance, $V_{A}$, is defined as the variance attributable to the linear regression of genotypic value ($Y$) on the number of $A$ alleles ($X$). $V_{A}$ is the variance of the breeding values. The regression coefficient, $\\beta$, is equivalent to the average effect of allele substitution, $\\alpha$.\n$$ \\beta = \\alpha = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\\text{Var}(X)} $$\n\nWe need the mean and variance of $X$. For a binomial distribution of alleles at a locus, $E[X] = 2p$ and $\\text{Var}(X) = 2pq$.\n$$ E[X] = 2(0.3) = 0.6 $$\n$$ \\text{Var}(X) = 2(0.3)(0.7) = 0.42 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the covariance, $\\text{Cov}(X, Y) = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y]$.\n$$ E[XY] = \\sum_{i} x_i y_i f_i = (0)(G_{aa})(q^2) + (1)(G_{Aa})(2pq) + (2)(G_{AA})(p^2) $$\n$$ E[XY] = (1)(7)(0.42) + (2)(10)(0.09) = 2.94 + 1.80 = 4.74 $$\n$$ \\text{Cov}(X, Y) = 4.74 - (0.6)(5.8) = 4.74 - 3.48 = 1.26 $$\n\nNow we can compute the regression coefficient $\\beta = \\alpha$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{1.26}{0.42} = 3 $$\n\nThe additive genetic variance $V_{A}$ is the part of the total variance explained by the linear regression. It is calculated as:\n$$ V_{A} = \\alpha^2 \\text{Var}(X) $$\n$$ V_{A} = (3)^2 (0.42) = 9 \\times 0.42 = 3.78 $$\n\nThe dominance genetic variance $V_{D}$ is the remaining genetic variance, i.e., the variance of the dominance deviations from the regression line.\n$$ V_{D} = V_{G} - V_{A} $$\n$$ V_{D} = 3.78 - 3.78 = 0 $$\n\nAlternatively, we can use the classic formulation involving additive ($a$) and dominance ($d$) effects, where the origin is the midpoint between the two homozygotes: $M = \\frac{G_{AA} + G_{aa}}{2} = \\frac{10+4}{2} = 7$.\nThe additive effect is $a = G_{AA} - M = 10 - 7 = 3$.\nThe dominance effect is $d = G_{Aa} - M = 7 - 7 = 0$.\nThe average effect of substitution is $\\alpha = a + (q-p)d = 3 + (0.7-0.3)(0) = 3$. This matches the regression result.\nThe variance components are then given by the standard formulae:\n$$ V_{A} = 2pq\\alpha^2 = 2(0.3)(0.7)(3^2) = 0.42 \\times 9 = 3.78 $$\n$$ V_{D} = (2pqd)^2 = (2(0.3)(0.7)(0))^2 = 0 $$\nBoth methods yield the identical result.\n\nInterpretation: The additive genetic variance is $V_{A} = 3.78$ and the dominance genetic variance is $V_{D} = 0$. The additive variance accounts for $100\\%$ of the total genetic variance. This signifies that the additive component completely dominates, or rather, it is the sole component. The reason for this is evident from the genotypic values. The value of the heterozygote, $G_{Aa} = 7$, is exactly at the midpoint of the values of the two homozygotes, $G_{AA} = 10$ and $G_{aa} = 4$. This relationship, where $G_{Aa} = \\frac{G_{AA} + G_{aa}}{2}$, is the definition of additive gene action, or \"no dominance\". When genotypic value is plotted against the number of $A$ alleles ($x=0, 1, 2$), the points $(0, 4)$, $(1, 7)$, and $(2, 10)$ lie perfectly on a straight line ($Y = 3X+4$).\nSince the relationship is perfectly linear, the linear regression model accounts for all the variance in the genotypic values. There are no deviations from this regression line, and therefore the dominance deviations are all zero. The variance of these zero-valued deviations, which is the dominance variance $V_{D}$, is consequently zero.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3.78 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2806408"}, {"introduction": "Observed data can often be explained by multiple competing biological models.

This inflated variance arises from the underlying bimodality of the phenotype in the heterozygote population.\n\n**Task 2: Numerical Analysis**\n\nFrom the empirical data, we estimate the model parameters:\n-   $\\hat{\\mu}_{aa} \\approx 0.00 \\implies \\hat{\\mu}_{0} = 0.00$\n-   $\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}_{aa} \\approx 0.04$ and $\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}_{AA} \\approx 0.04 \\implies \\hat{\\sigma}^{2} = 0.04$\n-   $\\hat{\\mu}_{AA} \\approx 2.00$ and $\\hat{\\mu}_{0} = 0.00 \\implies \\hat{\\Delta} = \\hat{\\mu}_{AA} - \\hat{\\mu}_{0} = 2.00$\n\nUsing the heterozygote mean, we estimate $\\pi$ under Model II:\n$$\n\\hat{\\mu}_{Aa} = \\hat{\\mu}_{0} + \\hat{\\pi}\\hat{\\Delta} \\implies 1.00 = 0.00 + \\hat{\\pi}(2.00) \\implies \\hat{\\pi} = 0.5\n$$\nNow, we predict the variance for heterozygotes using these estimated parameters in the derived formula for Model II:\n$$\n\\text{Predicted } \\mathrm{Var}(Y \\mid Aa) = \\hat{\\sigma}^{2} + \\hat{\\pi}(1-\\hat{\\pi})\\hat{\\Delta}^2\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Predicted } \\mathrm{Var}(Y \\mid Aa) = 0.04 + 0.5(1-0.5)(2.00)^2 = 0.04 + 0.25(4.00) = 0.04 + 1.00 = 1.04\n$$\n**Comparison and Interpretation:**\nThe predicted variance under Model II is $1.04$. The observed variance is $\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}_{Aa} \\approx 0.54$. The model, parameterized using the observed means, over-predicts the observed variance. While the model correctly captures the qualitative feature of variance inflation (predicting a variance greater than $\\sigma^2=0.04$), the quantitative prediction is not accurate. The observed variance inflation is $0.54 - 0.04 = 0.50$, whereas the predicted inflation is $1.00$. This suggests that while variable expressivity is a likely explanation for the inflated variance, this specific simple mixture model may be an oversimplification of the true biological process.\n\n**Task 3: Evaluation of Options**\n\nA. **Treat incomplete dominance as sufficient: fit $Y \\mid g \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{g}, \\sigma^{2})$ with $\\mu_{Aa}=\\mu_{aa}+h(\\mu_{AA}-\\mu_{aa})$ and a common $\\sigma^{2}$; set $h=0.5$ given the intermediate heterozygote mean and attribute the larger $\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}_{Aa}$ to sampling error.**\nThis is Model I. It correctly models the mean but mandates $\\mathrm{Var}(Y \\mid Aa) = \\sigma^2 \\approx 0.04$. The observed variance is $\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}_{Aa} \\approx 0.54$, which is more than an order of magnitude larger. In a \"large study,\" such a large discrepancy cannot be plausibly dismissed as sampling error. This approach ignores a critical feature of the data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nB. **Fit a two-component mixture for $Y \\mid Aa$ with mixing proportion $\\pi$ and component means constrained to $\\mu_{aa}$ and $\\mu_{AA}$ and a common within-component variance equal to the homozygote variance; estimate $\\pi$ by maximum likelihood and compare this mixture against the single-Gaussian incomplete-dominance model using a Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT). Under this mixture, predict $\\mathrm{Var}(Y \\mid Aa)=\\sigma^{2}+\\pi(1-\\pi)(\\mu_{AA}-\\mu_{aa})^{2}$, which can account for $\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}_{Aa} \\approx 0.54$.**\nThis option describes a sophisticated and principled statistical modeling strategy. It proposes using the correct mechanistic model (Model II) for variable expressivity. It correctly identifies the constraints from the homozygote data which strengthen the analysis. It proposes the correct statistical test (LRT) for comparing the complex model (mixture) against the simple one (single Gaussian). It correctly states the variance formula. The final clause, \"...which can account for $\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}_{Aa} \\approx 0.54$\", is correct in a mechanistic sense, even if the simple model's quantitative prediction is off. The term $\\pi(1-\\pi)(\\mu_{AA}-\\mu_{aa})^{2}$ is precisely the mechanism that \"accounts for\" the existence of variance inflation. Among the choices, this is the only one that presents a sound scientific and statistical methodology to explain the core phenomenon of variance inflation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nC. **Model codominance by convolving independent allele-specific normal effects, implying $\\mathrm{Var}(Y \\mid Aa)=2\\sigma^{2}$ and $\\mu_{Aa}=(\\mu_{AA}+\\mu_{aa})/2$, and reject the data as impossible because $\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}_{Aa}$ must equal $0.08$ if $\\sigma^{2}=0.04$.**\nThe premise $\\mathrm{Var}(Y \\mid Aa)=2\\sigma^{2}$ is not derived from standard principles of quantitative genetics and appears arbitrary. Even if this model were accepted, it predicts a variance of $2 \\times 0.04 = 0.08$, which severely disagrees with the observed $0.54$. The conclusion to \"reject the data as impossible\" is fundamentally unscientific. A scientist rejects a model that fails to fit the data, not the other way around.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. **Conclude overdominance and fit an unconstrained normal for $Y \\mid Aa$ with its own mean and variance; select this model because it maximizes likelihood without restricting parameters, thereby proving that heterozygotes are a distinct class.**\nThis option contains multiple errors. First, the data shows an intermediate mean ($\\hat{\\mu}_{Aa}=1.00$ is between $\\hat{\\mu}_{aa}=0.00$ and $\\hat{\\mu}_{AA}=2.00$), which contradicts the definition of overdominance. Second, selecting a model simply because it has the maximum likelihood is a recipe for overfitting; model selection requires penalizing for complexity (e.g., AIC, BIC) or formal hypothesis testing (e.g., LRT). Third, this approach is merely descriptive, not explanatory. It fits parameters to the heterozygote group but provides no mechanistic insight into *why* its mean and variance are what they are, unlike Model II.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2806431"}]}
