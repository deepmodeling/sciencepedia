{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To effectively study and discuss genetic traits, we must first master the precise language used to describe them. This exercise focuses on a crucial distinction: the difference between penetrance, which describes whether a genotype is expressed at all, and expressivity, which describes the degree to which it is expressed. By analyzing two contrasting clinical scenarios, you will sharpen your ability to differentiate these fundamental concepts, a skill essential for interpreting genetic data accurately [@problem_id:1508268].", "problem": "A team of geneticists is studying a dominant genetic disorder in humans called \"Chrono-Sensitivity Syndrome\" (CSS), which is caused by a single autosomal dominant allele, `C`. Individuals with at least one `C` allele are expected to experience a heightened sensitivity to changes in circadian rhythms, leading to severe jet lag. The researchers investigate two large, unrelated family pedigrees, Family A and Family B, where the `C` allele is known to be segregating.\n\n*   **Observation 1:** In Family A, genetic testing reveals 50 individuals who carry the `C` allele. However, after extensive interviews and clinical-physiological tests, not a single one of these 50 individuals reports or shows any signs of heightened sensitivity to circadian rhythm changes. Their response to jet lag is indistinguishable from that of family members with the `cc` genotype.\n\n*   **Observation 2:** In Family B, genetic testing identifies 60 individuals with the `C` allele. Every single one of them, upon clinical examination, shows a statistically significant, albeit sometimes minuscule, disruption in their melatonin secretion cycle when their light-dark cycle is artificially shifted in a lab setting. This disruption is the defined clinical phenotype for CSS. However, when asked to self-report, only 5 of these individuals feel they suffer from unusually severe jet lag in their daily lives. The other 55 report no noticeable difference compared to what they consider normal.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly interprets these observations in the context of genetic principles?\n\nA. Observation 1 describes 100% penetrance with low expressivity, and Observation 2 describes incomplete penetrance.\n\nB. Observation 1 describes 0% penetrance, and Observation 2 describes 100% penetrance with variable expressivity.\n\nC. Both observations are examples of incomplete penetrance, with Observation 1 showing lower penetrance than Observation 2.\n\nD. Observation 1 describes pleiotropy, and Observation 2 describes 0% penetrance.\n\nE. Both observations are examples of 100% penetrance, but Observation 1 shows low expressivity while Observation 2 shows high expressivity.", "solution": "Define penetrance as the proportion of individuals with a given genotype who exhibit any detectable phenotype associated with that genotype. Define expressivity as the extent or severity of the phenotype among those individuals who are penetrant (i.e., who exhibit the phenotype at all).\n\nFor Observation 1, there are 50 individuals with the dominant allele, but none shows any clinical or self-reported phenotype. Because no carrier exhibits the defined clinical phenotype, the penetrance for this family is zero. This cannot be described as low expressivity, because expressivity pertains only to individuals who express the phenotype; here, there are no phenotypically affected individuals. Therefore, Observation 1 is consistent with zero penetrance.\n\nFor Observation 2, all 60 carriers display a measurable clinical phenotype (disruption in melatonin secretion upon light-dark shift) as defined for CSS. Therefore, the penetrance, using the clinical definition, is equal to 1. The fact that only 5 report severe jet lag while 55 report no unusual symptoms reflects variability in the degree to which the phenotype manifests in everyday experience. This is variation in expressivity, not penetrance, because all carriers are clinically affected. Hence, Observation 2 shows complete penetrance with variable expressivity.\n\nCombining these, the correct interpretation is that Observation 1 describes zero penetrance, and Observation 2 describes complete (equal to 1) penetrance with variable expressivity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1508268"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative definitions to quantitative analysis is a key step in genetics. This problem challenges you to calculate the penetrance of a dominant allele using population-level data, integrating the concept with the principles of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. This practice demonstrates how observing phenotypic frequencies in a population can allow us to infer underlying genetic parameters, such as the penetrance of a specific genotype, which is a common task in population genetics research [@problem_id:1508261].", "problem": "In the beetle species *Coleoptera magnificens*, the color of the elytra (wing cases) is determined by a single gene with two alleles. The dominant allele, `A`, results in a metallic blue sheen, while the recessive allele, `a`, results in a plain brown color. A large, randomly mating population of these beetles is assumed to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The frequency of the recessive allele `a` in the gene pool is 0.6.\n\nA field biologist collects a random sample of 25,000 adult beetles from this population and finds that 8,460 of them exhibit the metallic blue sheen. Genetic testing on a subset of the beetles confirms that the dominant allele `A` has complete (100%) penetrance in homozygous dominant (`AA`) individuals. However, its penetrance is incomplete in heterozygous (`Aa`) individuals.\n\nAssuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, calculate the penetrance of the `A` allele in heterozygous individuals. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the allele frequencies in the Hardy-Weinberg population be $p$ for $A$ and $q$ for $a$, with $q=0.6$ given, hence $p=1-q=0.4$. Under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, genotype frequencies are:\n$$\nP(AA)=p^{2},\\quad P(Aa)=2pq,\\quad P(aa)=q^{2}.\n$$\nLet $f$ denote the penetrance of the metallic blue phenotype in heterozygotes $Aa$.

This advanced practice asks you to formalize penetrance, $\\pi_g$, as a conditional probability within a statistical model, and then derive its Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) from first principles [@problem_id:2836207]. Mastering this derivation bridges the gap between biological theory and the computational methods used to analyze genetic data and estimate parameters in modern research.", "problem": "A monogenic trait shows variable presence across individuals carrying the same genotype due to incomplete penetrance, while variation in severity (expressivity) is ignored by dichotomizing the phenotype. Let $Y \\in \\{0,1\\}$ denote the presence ($Y=1$) or absence ($Y=0$) of the focal trait, and let $G$ denote genotype. For a fixed genotype class $g$, define the penetrance function as the conditional probability $\\pi_g = \\Pr(Y=1 \\mid G=g)$. Suppose you sample $n_g$ unrelated individuals known to have genotype $g$, with conditional independence of phenotypes given $G=g$, and you observe $y_g$ individuals with $Y=1$.\n\nUsing only the core definitions of penetrance as a conditional probability, the Bernoulli model for a binary trait, and the independence of individuals within a genotype class, do the following:\n\n- Justify modeling the data for genotype $g$ with a genotype-specific Bernoulli likelihood parameterized by $\\pi_g$.\n- Construct the likelihood for $\\pi_g$ from the observed counts $(y_g, n_g)$ by appropriately combining independent Bernoulli trials.\n- Derive, from first principles, the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) $\\hat{\\pi}_g$ that maximizes the likelihood with respect to $\\pi_g$, taking care to consider the behavior at the boundaries $\\pi_g \\in [0,1]$.\n\nProvide your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression for $\\hat{\\pi}_g$ in terms of $y_g$ and $n_g$. No numerical evaluation is required, and no units apply. Do not include any other quantity in your final answer.", "solution": "The problem requires a three-part derivation from first principles.\n\nFirst, we must justify the use of a genotype-specific Bernoulli likelihood.\nFor any single individual $i$ with a known genotype $g$, the phenotype $Y_i$ is a binary random variable. It can take one of two values: $Y_i=1$ (trait present) or $Y_i=0$ (trait absent). By definition, the probability of observing the trait is the penetrance, $\\Pr(Y_i=1 \\mid G=g) = \\pi_g$. Consequently, the probability of not observing the trait is $\\Pr(Y_i=0 \\mid G=g) = 1 - \\Pr(Y_i=1 \\mid G=g) = 1 - \\pi_g$. A random variable that takes the value $1$ with probability $p$ and the value $0$ with probability $1-p$ is, by definition, a Bernoulli random variable. Therefore, the phenotype $Y_i$ for an individual with genotype $g$ follows a Bernoulli distribution with parameter $\\pi_g$, denoted $Y_i \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(\\pi_g)$. The probability mass function for a single observation $y_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ can be written compactly as $f(y_i \\mid \\pi_g) = \\pi_g^{y_i} (1-\\pi_g)^{1-y_i}$. This provides the likelihood for a single observation.\n\nSecond, we construct the likelihood function for the entire sample.\nWe have a sample of $n_g$ individuals with genotype $g$. Their observed phenotypes are $y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_{n_g}$. The problem states that the phenotypes are conditionally independent given the genotype. The likelihood of the observed data is the joint probability of observing this specific sequence of phenotypes, which, due to independence, is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$\nL(\\pi_g \\mid y_1, \\ldots, y_{n_g}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n_g} \\Pr(Y_i=y_i \\mid \\pi_g)\n$$\nSubstituting the Bernoulli probability mass function for each individual, we get:\n$$\nL(\\pi_g) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n_g} \\pi_g^{y_i} (1-\\pi_g)^{1-y_i}\n$$\nUsing the properties of exponents, we can combine the terms:\n$$\nL(\\pi_g) = \\pi_g^{\\sum_{i=1}^{n_g} y_i} (1-\\pi_g)^{\\sum_{i=1}^{n_g} (1-y_i)}\n$$\nThe sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{n_g} y_i$ is the total count of individuals with the trait, which is given as $y_g$. The second exponent is $\\sum_{i=1}^{n_g} 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^{n_g} y_i = n_g - y_g$, which is the total count of individuals without the trait.\nTherefore, the likelihood function for $\\pi_g$ given the observed counts $(y_g, n_g)$ is:\n$$\nL(\\pi_g) = \\pi_g^{y_g} (1-\\pi_g)^{n_g - y_g}\n$$\nThis function is proportional to the probability mass function of a Binomial$(n_g, \\pi_g)$ distribution for the total count $y_g$.\n\nThird, we derive the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) $\\hat{\\pi}_g$.\nThe MLE is the value of $\\pi_g$ that maximizes the likelihood function $L(\\pi_g)$. It is equivalent and arithmetically simpler to maximize the natural logarithm of the likelihood, known as the log-likelihood function, $\\ell(\\pi_g) = \\ln(L(\\pi_g))$.\n$$\n\\ell(\\pi_g) = \\ln\\left( \\pi_g^{y_g} (1-\\pi_g)^{n_g - y_g} \\right) = y_g \\ln(\\pi_g) + (n_g - y_g) \\ln(1-\\pi_g)\n$$\nTo find the maximum, we compute the first derivative of $\\ell(\\pi_g)$ with respect to $\\pi_g$ and set it to zero. This is valid for $\\pi_g \\in (0,1)$.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\ell}{d\\pi_g} = \\frac{d}{d\\pi_g} \\left[ y_g \\ln(\\pi_g) + (n_g - y_g) \\ln(1-\\pi_g) \\right] = \\frac{y_g}{\\pi_g} - \\frac{n_g - y_g}{1-\\pi_g}\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero to find the critical point $\\hat{\\pi}_g$:\n$$\n\\frac{y_g}{\\hat{\\pi}_g} - \\frac{n_g - y_g}{1-\\hat{\\pi}_g} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{y_g}{\\hat{\\pi}_g} = \\frac{n_g - y_g}{1-\\hat{\\pi}_g}\n$$\n$$\ny_g(1-\\hat{\\pi}_g) = \\hat{\\pi}_g(n_g - y_g)\n$$\n$$\ny_g - y_g\\hat{\\pi}_g = n_g\\hat{\\pi}_g - y_g\\hat{\\pi}_g\n$$\n$$\ny_g = n_g\\hat{\\pi}_g\n$$\nSolving for $\\hat{\\pi}_g$ yields:\n$$\n\\hat{\\pi}_g = \\frac{y_g}{n_g}\n$$\nThis solution is valid for the interior of the domain, where $0 < y_g < n_g$. We must also consider the boundary cases as required.\nCase 1: $y_g = 0$. The log-likelihood becomes $\\ell(\\pi_g) = n_g \\ln(1-\\pi_g)$. This function is monotonically decreasing for $\\pi_g \\in [0, 1)$. Its maximum value on this domain occurs at the smallest possible value of $\\pi_g$, which is $\\pi_g=0$. So, $\\hat{\\pi}_g = 0$. The formula $\\frac{y_g}{n_g}$ gives $\\frac{0}{n_g}=0$.\nCase 2: $y_g = n_g$. The log-likelihood becomes $\\ell(\\pi_g) = n_g \\ln(\\pi_g)$. This function is monotonically increasing for $\\pi_g \\in (0, 1]$. Its maximum value on this domain occurs at the largest possible value of $\\pi_g$, which is $\\pi_g=1$. So, $\\hat{\\pi}_g = 1$. The formula $\\frac{y_g}{n_g}$ gives $\\frac{n_g}{n_g}=1$.\nThus, the expression $\\hat{\\pi}_g = \\frac{y_g}{n_g}$ is valid for all possible values of $y_g$, from $0$ to $n_g$.\n\nTo confirm this critical point is a maximum, we examine the second derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\ell}{d\\pi_g^2} = \\frac{d}{d\\pi_g} \\left[ \\frac{y_g}{\\pi_g} - \\frac{n_g - y_g}{1-\\pi_g} \\right] = -\\frac{y_g}{\\pi_g^2} - \\frac{n_g-y_g}{(1-\\pi_g)^2}\n$$\nFor $0 < \\pi_g < 1$, and given that $y_g \\ge 0$ and $n_g - y_g \\ge 0$, both terms in the second derivative are non-positive. As long as $0 < y_g < n_g$, both terms are strictly negative, so $\\frac{d^2\\ell}{d\\pi_g^2} < 0$. This confirms that the log-likelihood function is concave and the critical point is a global maximum. The derived estimator is the sample proportion of affected individuals, which is the intuitively correct answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{y_g}{n_g}}$$", "id": "2836207"}]}
