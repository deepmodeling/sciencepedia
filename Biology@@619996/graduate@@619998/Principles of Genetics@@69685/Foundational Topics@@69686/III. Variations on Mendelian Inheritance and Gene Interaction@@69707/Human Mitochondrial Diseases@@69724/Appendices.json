This problem [@problem_id:2823736] asks you to model this key genetic event from first principles.

Her blood heteroplasmy is measured at $0.20$. Clinical observation for this variant supports a threshold effect: offspring are expected to manifest clinically significant disease if their tissue heteroplasmy fraction $H$ is at least $t = 0.60$. Assume the following foundational principles and modeling assumptions:\n\n- Maternal inheritance of mtDNA with negligible paternal contribution.\n- A developmental mitochondrial bottleneck can be approximated by binomial sampling of an effective number $N_e$ of segregating mtDNA genomes into each oocyte, with per-genome mutant probability equal to the maternal mean heteroplasmy $p_0 = 0.20$.\n- Post-bottleneck amplification and subsequent embryonic development occur without selection on the variant and without additional systematic shifts in $H$, so that the oocyte fraction $H$ approximates the conceptus fraction at clinical ascertainment.\n- The maternal blood heteroplasmy approximates the maternal mean heteroplasmy across the oocyte precursor pool.\n\nStarting strictly from these principles and assumptions (no additional shortcut formulas), derive a closed-form analytic expression for the recurrence risk $R(N_e)$ that a randomly selected offspring will have $H \\ge t$, expressed solely as a function of $N_e$, $p_0 = 0.20$, and $t = 0.60$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of mitochondrial genetics, is well-posed with a clear objective and a specified probabilistic model, and is free from ambiguity or contradiction. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the recurrence risk, $R(N_e)$, for an offspring of a mother with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heteroplasmy $p_0 = 0.20$. The clinical manifestation of the disease occurs if the offspring's heteroplasmy fraction, $H$, meets or exceeds a threshold $t = 0.60$.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the mitochondrial bottleneck, which is modeled as a binomial sampling process. Let $N_e$ be the effective number of mtDNA genomes segregating into an oocyte. Each of these genomes is a mutant with probability $p_0$, independently of the others. Let $K$ be the random variable representing the number of mutant mtDNA genomes that are segregated into a particular oocyte.\n\nAccording to the binomial sampling model provided, $K$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $N_e$ (the number of trials) and $p_0$ (the probability of success, i.e., sampling a mutant genome). We write this as $K \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N_e, p_0)$. The probability mass function (PMF) for $K$ is given by:\n$$P(K=k) = \\binom{N_e}{k} p_0^k (1-p_0)^{N_e-k}$$\nfor $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, N_e\\}$.\n\nThe heteroplasmy fraction $H$ in the oocyte is defined as the ratio of mutant genomes to the total number of genomes. Based on our definition of $K$ and $N_e$, we have:\n$$H = \\frac{K}{N_e}$$\n\nThe recurrence risk, $R(N_e)$, is the probability that an offspring will be clinically affected, which corresponds to the condition $H \\ge t$. We can express this in terms of the random variable $K$:\n$$R(N_e) = P(H \\ge t) = P\\left(\\frac{K}{N_e} \\ge t\\right) = P(K \\ge t N_e)$$\n\nSince $K$ must be an integer, the condition $K \\ge t N_e$ is equivalent to $K$ being greater than or equal to the smallest integer that satisfies this inequality. This smallest integer is $\\lceil t N_e \\rceil$. Let us define $k_{\\min} = \\lceil t N_e \\rceil$. The risk $R(N_e)$ is the probability that $K$ takes on any integer value from $k_{\\min}$ up to the maximum possible value, $N_e$. This is calculated by summing the probabilities for each of these outcomes:\n$$R(N_e) = \\sum_{k=k_{\\min}}^{N_e} P(K=k) = \\sum_{k=\\lceil t N_e \\rceil}^{N_e} \\binom{N_e}{k} p_0^k (1-p_0)^{N_e-k}$$\n\nThis sum represents the cumulative probability in the right tail of a binomial distribution. While this expression is correct, a more compact closed-form representation is available using a standard special function. The sum of the tail probabilities of a binomial distribution can be expressed using the regularized incomplete beta function, denoted as $I_x(a,b)$. The identity is:\n$$ \\sum_{j=m}^{n} \\binom{n}{j} p^j (1-p)^{n-j} = I_p(m, n-m+1) $$\nApplying this identity to our expression for $R(N_e)$, we set $n=N_e$, $p=p_0$, and the starting index $m = \\lceil t N_e \\rceil$. This yields the closed-form analytic expression for the recurrence risk:\n$$R(N_e) = I_{p_0}(\\lceil t N_e \\rceil, N_e - \\lceil t N_e \\rceil + 1)$$\nwhere $p_0 = 0.20$ and $t = 0.60$. This is the final expression for the recurrence risk as a function of $N_e$, $p_0$, and $t$.\n\nFrom this functional dependence, two key counseling implications can be logically derived:\n\n1.  Dependence on $N_e$: The variance of the offspring heteroplasmy distribution is given by $\\text{Var}(H) = \\text{Var}(K/N_e) = (1/N_e^2)\\text{Var}(K) = (p_0(1-p_0))/N_e$. As the effective bottleneck size $N_e$ increases, the variance of $H$ decreases. This means the distribution of offspring heteroplasmy becomes more tightly centered around the maternal mean, $p_0 = 0.20$. Since the maternal heteroplasmy is substantially lower than the clinical threshold ($0.20 \\ll 0.60$), a tighter distribution (larger $N_e$) makes it less probable that a random sampling event will produce an oocyte with heteroplasmy high enough to cross the threshold. Consequently, a larger bottleneck size $N_e$ lowers the recurrence risk for this mother.\n\n2.  Dependence on $t$: The recurrence risk is the probability of exceeding the threshold, $R(N_e) = P(H \\ge t)$. For any given distribution of $H$ (determined by $N_e$ and $p_0$), increasing the value of the threshold $t$ makes the condition for being affected more stringent. This necessarily reduces the probability of satisfying the condition. Therefore, for a given maternal state, a mitochondrial disease with a higher clinical threshold $t$ inherently carries a lower recurrence risk of manifesting in offspring.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{I_{p_0}(\\lceil t N_e \\rceil, N_e - \\lceil t N_e \\rceil + 1)}$$", "id": "2823736"}]}
