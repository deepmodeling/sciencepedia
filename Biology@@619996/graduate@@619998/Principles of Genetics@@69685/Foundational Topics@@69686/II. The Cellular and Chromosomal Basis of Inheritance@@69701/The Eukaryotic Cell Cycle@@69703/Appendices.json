By implementing a defined algorithm to process these time-lapse fluorescence signals, you will gain hands-on experience in measuring cell cycle phase durations and appreciating their inherent cell-to-cell variability [@problem_id:2857561].", "problem": "You are given time-lapse measurements from the Fluorescent Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle Indicator (FUCCI), a dual-reporter system in which the Cdt1-based red reporter is high in the G1 phase and the Geminin-based green reporter is high in S/G2/M. In a eukaryotic cell, the cell cycle proceeds through G1, S, G2, and M. At single-cell resolution, the first time at which the green reporter sustainably exceeds the red reporter marks the operational G1-to-S transition; thereafter the cell is in S/G2/M until the next mitosis. Your task is to compute, for each provided single-cell trace, the G1 duration and the S/G2/M duration, and then quantify cell-to-cell variability using the coefficient of variation.\n\nFundamental base and operational definitions to be used:\n- The eukaryotic cell cycle comprises phases G1, S, G2, and M. In the FUCCI system, the red Cdt1 reporter intensity is higher during G1 while the green Geminin reporter intensity is higher during S/G2/M.\n- For each cell, you are given two time series: red intensity $R[i]$ and green intensity $G[i]$ at discrete frames $i = 0, 1, \\dots, E-1$ sampled at a constant time interval $\\Delta t$ (in hours).\n- To reduce measurement noise, apply a centered moving median filter of odd window size $w$ (in frames) to $R[i]$ and $G[i]$. Use edge-padding (replicate boundary values) so that the filtered series have the same length as the input series.\n- Define a decision variable $\\delta[i] = G_{\\text{med}}[i] - R_{\\text{med}}[i]$, where $G_{\\text{med}}$ and $R_{\\text{med}}$ are the median-filtered series.\n- Use a strict threshold $\\theta = 0$: assign G1 when $\\delta[i] \\le \\theta$ and S/G2/M when $\\delta[i] > \\theta$.\n- To ensure robustness, declare the G1-to-S transition index $i^\\ast$ as the smallest index such that $\\delta[i] > \\theta$ for $h$ consecutive frames, i.e., $\\delta[i] > 0, \\delta[i+1] > 0, \\dots, \\delta[i+h-1] > 0$, with $i+h-1 \\le E-1$.\n- The G1 duration is $T_{\\mathrm{G1}} = i^\\ast \\cdot \\Delta t$ (in hours).\n- The S/G2/M duration is $T_{\\mathrm{S/G2/M}} = (E - i^\\ast) \\cdot \\Delta t$ (in hours), i.e., from the first S frame through the last frame before mitosis.\n- If no sustained transition exists (no index satisfies the $h$-frame positivity condition), then both durations are undefined for that cell; represent each undefined value as the floating-point NaN (not-a-number).\n- Across all cells with defined durations, quantify variability using the coefficient of variation (CV), defined for a set $\\{x_1,\\dots,x_n\\}$ with mean $\\mu = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^{n} x_k$ and population standard deviation $\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^{n}(x_k - \\mu)^2}$, as $\\mathrm{CV} = \\sigma / \\mu$.

The problem is scientifically grounded, internally consistent, and complete. It is therefore deemed valid and a solution can be derived by rigorously following the specified algorithm.\n\nThe core task is to determine the durations of the G1 and S/G2/M phases of the eukaryotic cell cycle from fluorescent intensity traces and to quantify their cell-to-cell variability. The solution methodology proceeds in a sequence of discrete, formal steps for each single-cell trace.\n\nFirst, we are given time-series data for a red reporter ($R[i]$) and a green reporter ($G[i]$) at discrete time points $i$ from $0$ to $E-1$, sampled at an interval of $\\Delta t$. The $R$ signal is high in the G1 phase, while the $G$ signal is high in the S/G2/M phases.\n\nTo mitigate measurement noise, a common source of error in fluorescence microscopy, the problem mandates the application of a centered moving median filter with a window size $w=3$ to both time series. For a given series $X[i]$, the filtered value $X_{\\text{med}}[i]$ is the median of $\\{X[i-1], X[i], X[i+1]\\}$. To handle the boundaries of the series ($i=0$ and $i=E-1$), edge-padding is specified, where the boundary values are replicated. This ensures the filtered series $R_{\\text{med}}$ and $G_{\\text{med}}$ have the same length $E$ as the original data. This filtering step smoothens spurious spikes while preserving sharp transitions, which is advantageous for detecting the cell cycle phase switch.\n\nNext, a decision variable, $\\delta[i]$, is defined as the difference between the filtered green and red intensities:\n$$\n\\delta[i] = G_{\\text{med}}[i] - R_{\\text{med}}[i]\n$$\nThis variable quantifies the relative dominance of the two reporters. A positive value of $\\delta[i]$ indicates that the green reporter (S/G2/M marker) is stronger than the red one (G1 marker), and vice-versa. The phase transition is determined by a strict threshold $\\theta = 0$. A cell is in G1 when $\\delta[i] \\le \\theta$ and in S/G2/M when $\\delta[i] > \\theta$.\n\nTo ensure the detected transition is not a transient fluctuation, a robustness criterion is imposed. The G1-to-S transition is marked by the first time index, $i^\\ast$, where $\\delta[i]$ remains positive for $h$ consecutive frames. Formally, $i^\\ast$ is the smallest index $i$ in $[0, E-h]$ such that $\\delta[k] > 0$ for all $k \\in [i, i+h-1]$. If no such index exists in the data, the transition is considered undefined for that cell.\n\nOnce $i^\\ast$ is determined, the phase durations are calculated. The G1 phase comprises all time frames up to the transition, so its duration is:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{G1}} = i^\\ast \\cdot \\Delta t\n$$\nThe S/G2/M phase comprises the remaining frames of the observation. Its duration is:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{S/G2/M}} = (E - i^\\ast) \\cdot \\Delta t\n$$\nIf $i^\\ast$ is not found, both $T_{\\mathrm{G1}}$ and $T_{\\mathrm{S/G2/M}}$ are set to Not-a-Number (NaN) to signify the undefined state.\n\nFinally, to quantify cell-to-cell variability, the coefficient of variation (CV) is computed for the set of G1 durations and the set of S/G2/M durations. The CV is a standardized measure of dispersion, defined as the ratio of the population standard deviation $\\sigma$ to the mean $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CV} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^{n}(x_k - \\mu)^2}}{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^{n} x_k}\n$$\nThis calculation is performed only on the cells for which the durations are defined (i.e., not NaN).\n\nApplying this procedure to the provided test cases:\n\n**Case A**: $\\Delta t=0.5, w=3, h=2, E=16$\n$R_{\\text{med}} = [78, 78, 75, 70, 65, 60, 55, 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 27, 25, 24, 23]$\n$G_{\\text{med}} = [10, 12, 14, 18, 22, 28, 35, 43, 52, 60, 68, 74, 78, 80, 82, 83]$\n$\\delta = [-68, -66, -61, -52, -43, -32, -20, -7, 7, 20, 33, 44, 51, 55, 58, 60]$\nThe first index $i$ such that $\\delta[i]>0$ and $\\delta[i+1]>0$ is $i^\\ast = 8$.\n$T_{\\mathrm{G1}} = 8 \\cdot 0.5 = 4.0$ hours.\n$T_{\\mathrm{S/G2/M}} = (16 - 8) \\cdot 0.5 = 4.0$ hours.\n\n**Case B**: $\\Delta t=0.5, w=3, h=2, E=16$\n$R_{\\text{med}} = [88, 88, 86, 84, 80, 76, 70, 65, 60, 55, 50, 45, 40, 38, 36, 34]$\n$G_{\\text{med}} = [8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 20, 50, 52, 52, 54, 60, 70, 80, 85]$\n$\\delta = [-80, -79, -76, -73, -67, -61, -53, -45, -10, -3, 2, 9, 20, 32, 44, 51]$\nThe first index $i$ such that $\\delta[i]>0$ and $\\delta[i+1]>0$ is $i^\\ast = 10$.\n$T_{\\mathrm{G1}} = 10 \\cdot 0.5 = 5.0$ hours.\n$T_{\\mathrm{S/G2/M}} = (16 - 10) \\cdot 0.5 = 3.0$ hours.\n\n**Case C**: $\\Delta t=0.5, w=3, h=2, E=10$\n$R_{\\text{med}} = [48, 48, 46, 44, 40, 38, 35, 34, 33, 32]$\n$G_{\\text{med}} = [55, 58, 60, 62, 65, 68, 70, 72, 74, 75]$\n$\\delta = [7, 10, 14, 18, 25, 30, 35, 38, 41, 43]$\nThe first index $i$ such that $\\delta[i]>0$ and $\\delta[i+1]>0$ is $i^\\ast = 0$.\n$T_{\\mathrm{G1}} = 0 \\cdot 0.5 = 0.0$ hours.\n$T_{\\mathrm{S/G2/M}} = (10 - 0) \\cdot 0.5 = 5.0$ hours.\n\n**Case D**: $\\Delta t=0.5, w=3, h=2, E=14$\n$R_{\\text{med}} = [118, 118, 116, 114, 112, 110, 108, 106, 100, 90, 80, 60, 40, 30]$\n$G_{\\text{med}} = [5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30, 40, 55, 70, 90]$\n$\\delta = [-113, -113, -110, -108, -105, -102, -99, -96, -80, -60, -40, -5, 30, 60]$\nThe first index $i$ such that $\\delta[i]>0$ and $\\delta[i+1]>0$ is $i^\\ast = 12$.\n$T_{\\mathrm{G1}} = 12 \\cdot 0.5 = 6.0$ hours.\n$T_{\\mathrm{S/G2/M}} = (14 - 12) \\cdot 0.5 = 1.0$ hour.\n\n**Coefficient of Variation Calculation**:\nFor $T_{\\mathrm{G1}}$ values $\\{4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 6.0\\}$:\n$\\mu_{\\mathrm{G1}} = (4.0 + 5.0 + 0.0 + 6.0)/4 = 3.75$\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{G1}} = \\sqrt{((4-3.75)^2 + (5-3.75)^2 + (0-3.75)^2 + (6-3.75)^2)/4} = \\sqrt{5.1875} \\approx 2.2776$\n$\\mathrm{CV}_{\\mathrm{G1}} = 2.2776 / 3.75 \\approx 0.607$\n\nFor $T_{\\mathrm{S/G2/M}}$ values $\\{4.0, 3.0, 5.0, 1.0\\}$:\n$\\mu_{\\mathrm{S/G2/M}} = (4.0 + 3.0 + 5.0 + 1.0)/4 = 3.25$\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{S/G2/M}} = \\sqrt{((4-3.25)^2 + (3-3.25)^2 + (5-3.25)^2 + (1-3.25)^2)/4} = \\sqrt{2.1875} \\approx 1.4790$\n$\\mathrm{CV}_{\\mathrm{S/G2/M}} = 1.4790 / 3.25 \\approx 0.455$\n\nAll results will be rounded to three decimal places for the final output.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import ndimage\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Processes single-cell FUCCI data to determine cell cycle phase durations\n    and their coefficient of variation.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A\n        (0.5, 3, 2, 16, \n         [80, 78, 75, 70, 65, 60, 55, 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 27, 25, 24, 23], \n         [10, 12, 14, 18, 22, 28, 35, 43, 52, 60, 68, 74, 78, 80, 82, 83]),\n        # Case B\n        (0.5, 3, 2, 16, \n         [90, 88, 86, 84, 80, 76, 70, 65, 60, 55, 50, 45, 40, 38, 36, 34],\n         [8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 20, 55, 50, 52, 54, 60, 70, 80, 85]),\n        # Case C\n        (0.5, 3, 2, 10,\n         [50, 48, 46, 44, 40, 38, 35, 34, 33, 32],\n         [55, 58, 60, 62, 65, 68, 70, 72, 74, 75]),\n        # Case D\n        (0.5, 3, 2, 14,\n         [120, 118, 116, 114, 112, 110, 108, 106, 100, 90, 80, 60, 40, 30],\n         [5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30, 40, 55, 70, 90])\n    ]\n\n    all_t_g1 = []\n    all_t_sg2m = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        delta_t, w, h, E, R, G = case\n        \n        # Convert lists to NumPy arrays for vectorized operations\n        R_arr = np.array(R, dtype=float)\n        G_arr = np.array(G, dtype=float)\n\n        # 1.

Substituting into (5):\n$K_{d}^{\\mathrm{CP}} = \\frac{C (P_{\\mathrm{T}} - CP)}{CP}$\n$CP (K_{d}^{\\mathrm{CP}} + C) = C \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{T}}$\nThus, $CP = \\frac{C \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{T}}}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{CP}} + C}$.\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions for $CE$ and $CP$ into the conservation law for CDK2, equation (1):\n$C_{\\mathrm{T}} = C + \\frac{C \\cdot E_{\\mathrm{T}}}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{CE}} + C} + \\frac{C \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{T}}}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{CP}} + C}$\n\nThis is the governing equation for the free CDK2 concentration, $C$. We substitute the given numerical values (all in nM):\n$50 = C + \\frac{80 C}{15 + C} + \\frac{40 C}{5 + C}$\n\nTo solve for $C$, we rearrange this equation into a polynomial form:\n$C^3 + 90C^2 + 75C - 3750 = 0$\n\nThis cubic equation must be solved for $C$. Since $C$ represents a physical concentration, we seek the single positive real root. Numerical solution of this polynomial yields:\n$C \\approx 5.87521\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n\nWith this value for $C$, we can now compute the concentration of the active complex, $CE$:\n$CE = \\frac{C \\cdot E_{\\mathrm{T}}}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{CE}} + C} = \\frac{5.87521 \\cdot 80}{15 + 5.87521} = \\frac{470.0168}{20.87521} \\approx 22.5155\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the fraction of active CDK2, $f_{\\mathrm{active}}$:\n$f_{\\mathrm{active}} = \\frac{CE}{C_{\\mathrm{T}}} = \\frac{22.5155}{50} = 0.45031$.\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives $0.4503$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4503}$$", "id": "2857502"}, {"introduction": "Individual molecular switches, like the one for CDK2, are often wired into larger circuits to create robust, all-or-none cellular decisions. This practice explores the classic example of the mitotic entry switch, where positive feedback loops involving CDK1 create a bistable system with hysteresis. By reasoning about the system's dynamics, you will predict how changes in an antagonistic enzyme affect the thresholds for entering and exiting mitosis, providing deep insight into the design principles that make cell cycle transitions decisive and irreversible [@problem_id:2857458].", "problem": "A canonical control module for mitotic entry and exit consists of Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), the inhibitory kinase Wee1, and the activating phosphatase Cell division cycle phosphatase 25 (Cdc25). CDK1 bound to its cyclin partner ($C$, the effective concentration of active cyclin) is inhibited by Wee1 and activated by Cdc25. Active CDK1 phosphorylates Wee1 to inhibit it and phosphorylates Cdc25 to activate it, establishing coupled positive feedback loops. Antagonistic protein phosphatases (for example, Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A)) remove these activating phosphorylations on Cdc25 and inhibitory phosphorylations on Wee1, and also dephosphorylate CDK1 substrates. As $C$ slowly increases during interphase, the system exhibits a bistable, hysteretic switch in CDK1 activity: there is an entry threshold $C_{\\mathrm{on}}$ at which the system flips from the low-activity to the high-activity state upon increasing $C$, and an exit threshold $C_{\\mathrm{off}}$ at which it flips back upon decreasing $C$.\n\nAssume the following foundational facts and definitions, without invoking any detailed or system-specific fitted formulas:\n- Phosphorylation–dephosphorylation cycles obey mass-action balance: at steady state, the net phosphorylation flux on a substrate equals the net dephosphorylation flux. For a representative CDK1-controlled site, the phosphorylation flux scales monotonically with CDK1 activity ($A$) and the dephosphorylation flux scales monotonically with an effective phosphatase activity parameter ($P$).\n- Positive feedback via Cdc25/Wee1 can create an S-shaped steady-state relationship between $A$ and $C$, with bistability arising when the feedback is sufficiently strong relative to its antagonism by phosphatases.\n- The switching thresholds $C_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{off}}$ correspond to saddle-node points where the low- and high-activity steady states, respectively, lose stability as $C$ is quasi-statically ramped up or down.\n\nYou are asked to predict, from first principles, how uniformly increasing the effective phosphatase activity $P$ (for example, by upregulating PP2A or downregulating the Greatwall kinase pathway) shifts the values of $C_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{off}}$ required for mitotic entry and exit, respectively. Choose the best description of the direction of these shifts as $P$ increases, holding all other parameters fixed, assuming the circuit remains bistable.\n\nA. Both $C_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{off}}$ shift to higher $C$ (larger cyclin level is required to enter mitosis; exit occurs at a larger cyclin level), and the hysteresis window tends to shrink.\n\nB. $C_{\\mathrm{on}}$ increases (shifts to higher $C$), whereas $C_{\\mathrm{off}}$ decreases (shifts to lower $C$), expanding the hysteresis window.\n\nC. Both $C_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{off}}$ shift to lower $C$ (smaller cyclin level is sufficient to enter mitosis; exit occurs at a smaller cyclin level).\n\nD. $C_{\\mathrm{on}}$ decreases (shifts to lower $C$), whereas $C_{\\mathrm{off}}$ increases (shifts to higher $C$), reversing the hysteresis orientation.", "solution": "The core of the system is the regulation of CDK1 activity, which is driven by its cyclin partner, $C$. The steady-state activity of CDK1 is determined by a balance between its activation and inactivation. The crucial feature is the double positive feedback: active CDK1 promotes its own activation by activating its phosphatase (Cdc25) and inhibiting its kinase (Wee1). This self-amplifying nature of CDK1 activity is what creates a strong, bistable switch.\n\nThe antagonistic phosphatase, with effective activity $P$, opposes these feedback loops. It acts to inactivate Cdc25 and activate Wee1. In essence, the parameter $P$ represents the strength of the \"opposition\" to CDK1 auto-activation. An increase in phosphatase activity $P$ will have two synergistic effects, both of which suppress CDK1 activity: the activation pathway via Cdc25 is weakened, and the inactivation pathway via Wee1 is strengthened.\n\nConsequently, to achieve any specific level of steady-state CDK1 activity, a stronger initial stimulus is required to overcome the increased opposition from $P$. The initial stimulus is the cyclin concentration, $C$. Therefore, for any given level of CDK1 activity, a higher $P$ necessitates a higher $C$. Geometrically, this means that the S-shaped curve representing the steady-state CDK1 activity as a function of $C$ shifts to the right (towards higher values of $C$) as $P$ increases.\n\nThe thresholds $C_{\\mathrm{on}}$ (for entry into mitosis) and $C_{\\mathrm{off}}$ (for exit from mitosis) are the bifurcation points corresponding to the \"knees\" of this S-shaped curve. Since the entire curve shifts to the right along the $C$-axis, both of these characteristic points, $C_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{off}}$, must also shift to higher values of $C$. This means it takes more cyclin to both enter mitosis and to sustain the mitotic state.\n\nFurthermore, hysteresis and bistability are direct consequences of strong positive feedback. The phosphatase activity $P$ directly antagonizes this feedback. By increasing $P$, we weaken the effective strength of the positive feedback loops. As the feedback weakens, the S-shape of the curve becomes less pronounced, and the bistable region shrinks. Therefore, as $P$ increases, the two bifurcation points $C_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{off}}$ must move closer together, causing the hysteresis window ($C_{\\mathrm{on}} - C_{\\mathrm{off}}$) to shrink.\n\nThis reasoning leads to the conclusion that increasing phosphatase activity $P$ causes both the mitotic entry threshold ($C_{\\mathrm{on}}$) and the mitotic exit threshold ($C_{\\mathrm{off}}$) to increase, while the width of the hysteretic window decreases.
