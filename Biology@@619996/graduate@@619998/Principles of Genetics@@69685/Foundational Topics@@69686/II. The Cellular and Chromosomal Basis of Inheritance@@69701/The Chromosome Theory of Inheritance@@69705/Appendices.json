All concepts invoked—the chromosome theory of inheritance, crossing over, recombination fraction, map distance, coefficient of coincidence, and interference—are well-established and central to the field of genetics. The provided data is internally consistent: the most frequent progeny classes ($ABC$ and $abc$) correspond to the parental (non-recombinant) haplotypes, and the least frequent classes ($AbC$ and $aBc$) correspond to the double-crossover haplotypes. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It is not trivial, as it requires step-by-step derivation from first principles.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe foundation of solving this problem is the classification of progeny based on the meiotic events that produced the gametes from the heterozygous parent. The parental haplotypes are $A B C$ and $a b c$.\n\nFirst, we determine the gene order. The parental classes are the most numerous: $ABC$ ($806$) and $abc$ ($806$). The double-crossover (DCO) classes are the least numerous: $AbC$ ($6$) and $aBc$ ($6$). By comparing a parental haplotype (e.g., $A B C$) with a double-crossover haplotype (e.g., $A b C$), the locus that is different ($B/b$) is identified as the middle gene. Thus, the gene order is $A-B-C$.\n\nWith the gene order established, we can categorize the progeny classes according to the crossover events in the two intervals, region I ($A-B$) and region II ($B-C$).\n- Parental (Non-crossover, NCO): Gametes that experienced no crossovers in the region. Haplotypes are $A B C$ and $a b c$. The total count is $n_{NCO} = n_{ABC} + n_{abc} = 806 + 806 = 1612$.\n- Single Crossover in Region I (SCO-I): Gametes from a crossover between $A$ and $B$. Haplotypes are $A b c$ and $a B C$. The total count is $n_{SCO-I} = n_{Abc} + n_{aBC} = 114 + 114 = 228$.\n- Single Crossover in Region II (SCO-II): Gametes from a crossover between $B$ and $C$. Haplotypes are $A B c$ and $a b C$. The total count is $n_{SCO-II} = n_{ABc} + n_{abC} = 74 + 74 = 148$.\n- Double Crossover (DCO): Gametes from simultaneous crossovers in region I and region II. Haplotypes are $A b C$ and $a B c$. The total count is $n_{DCO} = n_{AbC} + n_{aBc} = 6 + 6 = 12$.\n\nThe total number of progeny is $N$.\n$$N = n_{NCO} + n_{SCO-I} + n_{SCO-II} + n_{DCO} = 1612 + 228 + 148 + 12 = 2000$$\n\nNow, we derive the estimators for the recombination fractions. The recombination fraction, $r_{XY}$, between two loci $X$ and $Y$ is the proportion of progeny that show a recombinant combination of alleles for these loci. This is equivalent to the frequency of gametes resulting from an odd number of crossovers between $X$ and $Y$. For linked genes, this is estimated by counting all progeny that resulted from a crossover event between the loci.\n\nThe estimator for the recombination fraction between $A$ and $B$, $\\hat{r}_{AB}$, includes progeny from single crossovers in region I and double crossovers, as both events generate recombination between $A$ and $B$.\n$$ \\hat{r}_{AB} = \\frac{n_{SCO-I} + n_{DCO}}{N} = \\frac{(n_{Abc} + n_{aBC}) + (n_{AbC} + n_{aBc})}{N} $$\nThe map distance estimator, $\\hat{d}_{AB}$, is given by the problem's definition:\n$$ \\hat{d}_{AB} (\\text{cM}) = 100 \\times \\hat{r}_{AB} = 100 \\times \\frac{(n_{Abc} + n_{aBC}) + (n_{AbC} + n_{aBc})}{N} $$\n\nThe estimator for the recombination fraction between $B$ and $C$, $\\hat{r}_{BC}$, includes progeny from single crossovers in region II and double crossovers.\n$$ \\hat{r}_{BC} = \\frac{n_{SCO-II} + n_{DCO}}{N} = \\frac{(n_{ABc} + n_{abC}) + (n_{AbC} + n_{aBc})}{N} $$\nThe map distance estimator, $\\hat{d}_{BC}$, is:\n$$ \\hat{d}_{BC} (\\text{cM}) = 100 \\times \\hat{r}_{BC} = 100 \\times \\frac{(n_{ABc} + n_{abC}) + (n_{AbC} + n_{aBc})}{N} $$\n\nThe estimator for the recombination fraction between the flanking markers $A$ and $C$, $\\hat{r}_{AC}$, includes only progeny that have a recombinant combination of alleles for $A$ and $C$. Single crossover events (in either region I or II) produce such progeny. Double crossover events, however, restore the parental linkage of alleles for the flanking markers ($A$ and $C$ in $AbC$; $a$ and $c$ in $aBc$). Therefore, DCO progeny are non-recombinant with respect to loci $A$ and $C$.\n$$ \\hat{r}_{AC} = \\frac{n_{SCO-I} + n_{SCO-II}}{N} = \\frac{(n_{Abc} + n_{aBC}) + (n_{ABc} + n_{abC})}{N} $$\nThe map distance estimator, $\\hat{d}_{AC}$, is:\n$$ \\hat{d}_{AC} (\\text{cM}) = 100 \\times \\hat{r}_{AC} = 100 \\times \\frac{(n_{Abc} + n_{aBC}) + (n_{ABc} + n_{abC})}{N} $$\nIt must be noted that this distance estimator $\\hat{d}_{AC}$ based on the recombination fraction $\\hat{r}_{AC}$ underestimates the true map distance, because it fails to account for the two crossover events in the DCO class. A more accurate measure of map distance between flanking markers is the sum of the map distances of the intervening segments, $\\hat{d}_{AB} + \\hat{d}_{BC}$.\n\nNext, we derive the expressions for the coefficient of coincidence, $c$, and interference, $I$.\nThe coefficient of coincidence $c$ is the ratio of the observed frequency of double crossovers to the expected frequency of double crossovers.\nThe observed DCO frequency is:\n$$ f_{DCO, obs} = \\frac{n_{DCO}}{N} = \\frac{n_{AbC} + n_{aBc}}{N} $$\nThe expected DCO frequency, under the null model of no interference (independent crossovers in adjacent intervals), is the product of the recombination frequencies in the two adjacent intervals.\n$$ f_{DCO, exp} = \\hat{r}_{AB} \\times \\hat{r}_{BC} $$\nThus, the coefficient of coincidence $c$ is:\n$$ c = \\frac{f_{DCO, obs}}{f_{DCO, exp}} = \\frac{(n_{AbC} + n_{aBc}) / N}{\\hat{r}_{AB} \\times \\hat{r}_{BC}} = \\frac{N(n_{AbC} + n_{aBc})}{((n_{Abc} + n_{aBC}) + (n_{AbC} + n_{aBc}))((n_{ABc} + n_{abC}) + (n_{AbC} + n_{aBc}))} $$\nInterference, $I$, measures the degree to which a crossover in one region affects the probability of a crossover in an adjacent region. It is defined as:\n$$ I = 1 - c $$\n\nFinally, we evaluate $I$ numerically using the provided data.\nFirst, we compute the recombination fraction estimators:\n$$ \\hat{r}_{AB} = \\frac{228 + 12}{2000} = \\frac{240}{2000} = 0.12 $$\n$$ \\hat{r}_{BC} = \\frac{148 + 12}{2000} = \\frac{160}{2000} = 0.08 $$\nNext, we compute the observed and expected DCO frequencies:\n$$ f_{DCO, obs} = \\frac{12}{2000} = 0.006 $$\n$$ f_{DCO, exp} = \\hat{r}_{AB} \\times \\hat{r}_{BC} = 0.12 \\times 0.08 = 0.0096 $$\nNow, we calculate the coefficient of coincidence $c$:\n$$ c = \\frac{f_{DCO, obs}}{f_{DCO, exp}} = \\frac{0.006}{0.0096} = \\frac{60}{96} = \\frac{5}{8} = 0.625 $$\nThe interference $I$ is then:\n$$ I = 1 - c = 1 - 0.625 = 0.375 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ I = 0.3750 $$\nThis positive value of interference indicates that a crossover in one region reduces the likelihood of a crossover occurring in the adjacent region.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3750}$$", "id": "2856343"}, {"introduction": "This final practice elevates our perspective from the meiotic events within a single individual to their collective impact on the genetic architecture of an entire population.

Therefore, it is deemed valid and I shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. The first part requires the derivation of the dynamics of linkage disequilibrium, $D_t$, in a neutral, infinite population. The second part requires a qualitative analysis of these dynamics under weak epistatic selection in the quasi-linkage equilibrium regime. The final answer requested is the result from the first part.\n\nPart 1: Neutral Dynamics of Linkage Disequilibrium\n\nThe objective is to find an expression for the linkage disequilibrium $D_t$ at generation $t$ as a function of its initial value $D_0$, the recombination fraction $c$, and time $t$.\n\nWe begin with the fundamental definitions. The allele frequencies are $p_A(t) = x_{AB}(t) + x_{Ab}(t)$ and $p_B(t) = x_{AB}(t) + x_{aB}(t)$. The linkage disequilibrium is $D_t = x_{AB}(t) - p_A(t)p_B(t)$.\n\nUnder the assumptions of no selection, mutation, migration, or drift, the allele frequencies remain constant from one generation to the next. Thus, $p_A(t) = p_A(0)$ and $p_B(t) = p_B(0)$ for all $t \\geq 0$. We can therefore drop the time index from the allele frequencies and denote them simply as $p_A$ and $p_B$.\n\nThe dynamics of the system are governed by the change in haplotype frequencies due to meiotic recombination. We must derive the recursion relation for the haplotype frequencies. Let us consider the frequency of the $AB$ haplotype in the gamete pool of generation $t+1$, denoted $x_{AB}(t+1)$.\n\nA gamete produced by the diploid population of generation $t$ can be either non-recombinant, with probability $1-c$, or recombinant, with probability $c$.\n1.  If a gamete is non-recombinant, its allelic combination is identical to that of the parental chromosome from which it was copied. An $AB$ haplotype will be produced via this path if the parental chromosome was also $AB$. The frequency of $AB$ chromosomes in the gamete pool of generation $t$ is $x_{AB}(t)$. Therefore, the contribution to $x_{AB}(t+1)$ from non-recombinant events is $(1-c)x_{AB}(t)$.\n2.  If a gamete is recombinant, the alleles at the two loci are inherited from the two different homologous chromosomes of the parent. Due to random mating, the diploid individuals of generation $t$ are formed by the random union of gametes from generation $t-1$. In an infinite population, this means the two chromosomes of an individual are independent random draws from the gamete pool. Therefore, for a recombinant gamete, the probability of receiving allele $A$ from one chromosome is $p_A$, and the probability of receiving allele $B$ from the other homologous chromosome is $p_B$. The joint probability is $p_A p_B$. Thus, the contribution to $x_{AB}(t+1)$ from recombinant events is $c \\, p_A p_B$.\n\nCombining these two contributions, we obtain the recurrence relation for the frequency of the $AB$ haplotype:\n$$x_{AB}(t+1) = (1-c)x_{AB}(t) + c \\, p_A p_B$$\nNow, we can derive the recurrence for linkage disequilibrium, $D_t$. Using its definition at generation $t+1$:\n$$D_{t+1} = x_{AB}(t+1) - p_A p_B$$\nSubstituting the expression for $x_{AB}(t+1)$:\n$$D_{t+1} = \\left( (1-c)x_{AB}(t) + c \\, p_A p_B \\right) - p_A p_B$$\n$$D_{t+1} = (1-c)x_{AB}(t) + (c - 1)p_A p_B$$\n$$D_{t+1} = (1-c)x_{AB}(t) - (1-c)p_A p_B$$\nFactoring out the term $(1-c)$:\n$$D_{t+1} = (1-c) \\left( x_{AB}(t) - p_A p_B \\right)$$\nBy definition, the term in the parenthesis is $D_t$. Therefore, we have the simple geometric recursion:\n$$D_{t+1} = (1-c)D_t$$\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous recurrence relation. We can solve it by unrolling the recursion back to time $t=0$:\n$$D_1 = (1-c)D_0$$\n$$D_2 = (1-c)D_1 = (1-c)(1-c)D_0 = (1-c)^2 D_0$$\n$$D_3 = (1-c)D_2 = (1-c)(1-c)^2 D_0 = (1-c)^3 D_0$$\nBy induction, the general solution for any generation $t$ is:\n$$D_t = (1-c)^t D_0$$\nThis expression shows that in the absence of other evolutionary forces, linkage disequilibrium decays geometrically over time at a rate determined by the recombination fraction $c$. If $c>0$, $D_t \\to 0$ as $t \\to \\infty$.\n\nPart 2: Dynamics under Weak Selection\n\nNow we consider the addition of weak selection. The fitness landscape is non-additive: haplotypes $AB$ and $ab$ have a higher fitness ($1+\\varepsilon$) than haplotypes $Ab$ and $aB$ (fitness $1$). This non-additivity is a form of epistasis. Specifically, the fitness advantage of allele $A$ depends on the background at the $B$ locus (and vice-versa), which is the definition of epistasis. Epistatic selection is a force that can generate linkage disequilibrium.\n\nThe life cycle proceeds in two steps: selection, then meiosis (recombination). Let $D_t$ be the LD at the start of a generation (in gametes). After selection on diploid individuals, the frequencies in the surviving population that will produce the next generation's gametes are altered. Let the post-selection LD be $D'_t$. During meiosis in these survivors, recombination occurs. The LD in the gametes of the next generation, $D_{t+1}$, is related to the post-selection LD, $D'_t$, by the same logic as in Part 1:\n$$D_{t+1} = (1-c)D'_t$$\nThe change in LD over one generation is $\\Delta D_t = D_{t+1} - D_t = (1-c)D'_t - D_t$.\n\nThe crux of the analysis is to understand how $D'_t$ relates to $D_t$. The change from $D_t$ to $D'_t$ is due to selection alone. Let this change be $\\Delta_{sel} D_t = D'_t - D_t$. This change is caused by epistasis. Selection favors the combinations $AB$ and $ab$, increasing their frequencies relative to the other two. This preferentially increases the product $x_{AB}x_{ab}$ over $x_{Ab}x_{aB}$, thus generating positive LD (assuming $D_t$ starts at or near $0$).\n\nThe magnitude of this generated LD, $\\Delta_{sel} D_t$, must be proportional to the strength of selection, $\\varepsilon$. It also depends on the amount of genetic variation present at both loci, upon which selection can act. This variation is maximized when allele frequencies are intermediate, and is quantified by the product of variances at each locus, $p_A(1-p_A)p_B(1-p_B)$. Therefore, the source term for LD is of the form:\n$$\\Delta_{sel} D_t \\approx K \\varepsilon \\, p_A(1-p_A)p_B(1-p_B)$$\nwhere $K$ is a constant of order unity, and the approximation holds for weak selection and weak LD. This is the \"additive source term\" mentioned in the problem.\n\nWe can now approximate the full dynamics. Since $\\Delta_{sel} D_t$ is of order $\\varepsilon$, let's write $D'_t = D_t + \\Delta_{sel} D_t$. Substituting this into the recursion for $D_{t+1}$:\n$$\\Delta D_t = (1-c)(D_t + \\Delta_{sel} D_t) - D_t$$\n$$\\Delta D_t = D_t + \\Delta_{sel} D_t - cD_t - c\\Delta_{sel} D_t - D_t$$\n$$\\Delta D_t = -cD_t + (1-c)\\Delta_{sel} D_t$$\nGiven that $\\varepsilon \\ll 1$ and we expect $c$ not to be vanishingly small, the term $c \\Delta_{sel} D_t$ is of higher order ($\\mathcal{O}(c\\varepsilon)$). We retain the leading terms for recombination (decay) and selection (source):\n$$\\Delta D_t \\approx -cD_t + \\Delta_{sel} D_t$$\nSubstituting the form of the source term:\n$$\\Delta D_t \\approx -cD_t + K \\varepsilon \\, p_A(1-p_A)p_B(1-p_B)$$\nA steady state, $D^*$, is reached when the change in LD per generation is zero, $\\Delta D = 0$. This represents a balance between recombination, which breaks down LD, and epistatic selection, which creates it.\n$$0 \\approx -cD^* + K \\varepsilon \\, p_A(1-p_A)p_B(1-p_B)$$\nSolving for the steady-state LD, $D^*$:\n$$D^* \\approx \\frac{K \\varepsilon}{c} p_A(1-p_A)p_B(1-p_B)$$\nThis result shows that a non-zero steady state is approached. Its magnitude is of order $\\varepsilon/c$. This argument relies on the quasi-linkage equilibrium (QLE) assumption, which posits that selection is weak compared to recombination ($c \\gg \\varepsilon$). This ensures that LD reaches its equilibrium value much faster than allele frequencies change, justifying our treatment of $p_A$ and $p_B$ as approximately constant. It also ensures that $D^*$ is small, which validates the linear approximations used throughout the derivation. The problem's instruction to neglect terms of order $\\varepsilon D_t$ is consistent with this regime, as $\\varepsilon D^* \\sim \\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^2/c)$ is a higher-order correction.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{(1-c)^t D_0}\n$$", "id": "2856357"}]}
