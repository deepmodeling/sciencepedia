This exercise provides a foundational practice in calculating the linking number for a simple, relaxed circular DNA molecule.

The plasmid is determined to have a length of 5,200 base pairs (bp). In a controlled in vitro environment, the circular DNA is prepared in a fully relaxed state, where it adopts the canonical B-form structure. This B-form DNA has a helical repeat of 10.4 base pairs per turn. Subsequently, a specific enzyme, a Type I topoisomerase, is added to the solution containing the relaxed plasmid. The enzyme's activity is allowed to proceed until it has introduced exactly 14 negative supercoils into each plasmid molecule, at which point the enzyme is denatured and removed. Calculate the final linking number of the supercoiled plasmid.", "solution": "For a closed circular DNA, the topological invariant linking number is given by $Lk = Tw + Wr$. In a fully relaxed B-form plasmid, the writhe is zero, so the relaxed linking number is $Lk_{0} = Tw = \\frac{N}{h}$, where $N$ is the number of base pairs and $h$ is the helical repeat in base pairs per turn.\n\nGiven $N = 5200$ bp and $h = 10.4$ bp/turn, the relaxed linking number is\n$$\nLk_{0} = \\frac{5200}{10.4} = \\frac{52000}{104} = 500.\n$$\n\nA Type I topoisomerase changes the linking number in steps of $1$.

In this practice problem, you will explore the dynamic interplay between these components. By analyzing a scenario where the environment, rather than an enzyme, alters the DNA's preferred helical structure, you will calculate the resulting writhe, gaining a deeper appreciation for how supercoiling is a direct consequence of topological constraints [@problem_id:2041916].", "problem": "A molecular biologist is studying the topological properties of DNA. A linear DNA fragment of 4200 base pairs (bp) is synthesized with complementary single-stranded overhangs. This fragment is then circularized by enzymatic ligation, forming a covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) molecule.\n\nThe resulting cccDNA plasmid is incubated in a physiological buffer solution (Buffer A), where the B-form DNA helix has a pitch of 10.5 bp per helical turn. The plasmid is treated with the enzyme Topoisomerase I, which systematically alters the DNA topology until all superhelical tension is released and the molecule is fully relaxed. Following this relaxation, the Topoisomerase I enzyme is irreversibly inactivated and removed from the solution.\n\nNext, the purified, relaxed plasmid is transferred into a new experimental buffer (Buffer B) containing a high concentration of salt. This change in the ionic environment alters the hydration shell of the DNA, causing the helical pitch to decrease to 10.0 bp per turn. The cccDNA molecule adjusts its tertiary structure to accommodate this change in helical winding.\n\nCalculate the writhe ($Wr$) of the plasmid in Buffer B.

In Buffer A, the helical pitch is $h_{A}=10.5$ base pairs per turn. Topoisomerase I is applied until the DNA is fully relaxed, which sets the linking number to the relaxed value in Buffer A:\n$$\nLk = Lk_{0}^{A} = \\frac{N}{h_{A}} = \\frac{4200}{10.5} = 400.\n$$\nAfter Topoisomerase I is removed, $Lk$ is fixed at $400$.\n\nIn Buffer B, the helical pitch changes to $h_{B}=10.0$ base pairs per turn, so the relaxed (preferred) twist in Buffer B is\n$$\nTw_{0}^{B} = \\frac{N}{h_{B}} = \\frac{4200}{10.0} = 420.\n$$\nWith $Lk$ constrained to remain $400$ and the molecule adjusting its tertiary structure (writhe) to accommodate the new helical winding, the twist minimizes torsional strain by matching the local relaxed value, so we take $Tw = Tw_{0}^{B} = 420$.
