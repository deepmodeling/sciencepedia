Because all four meiotic products are recovered together, tetrad data report the outcome of a single meiosis and can be used to quantify recombination and crossover interference at the level of a bivalent.\n\nYou cross two haploid strains that differ at three markers $A$, $B$, and $C$ on the same chromosome. Marker $B$ is suspected to lie between $A$ and $C$. You genotype all four spores from each ascus, and you classify each tetrad as unordered for each pair of markers into Parental Ditype (PD), Tetratype (T), or Nonparental Ditype (NPD). Across $N = 250$ tetrads, you obtain the following pairwise tetrad counts:\n\n- For the interval $A$–$B$: $PD = 150$, $T = 90$, $NPD = 10$.\n- For the interval $B$–$C$: $PD = 140$, $T = 100$, $NPD = 10$.\n\nIn addition, using the three-locus haplotypes of all spores across all tetrads, you identify $D = 35$ spores that are double recombinant chromatids with respect to the two intervals $A$–$B$ and $B$–$C$ (that is, they carry a crossover in both intervals in that meiosis). Assume no chromatid interference, that all spores are viable and correctly typed, and ignore gene conversion.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions that connect tetrad classes to recombinant chromatid counts, and the definition of interference in terms of the coefficient of coincidence, compute the interference value for the $A$–$B$–$C$ region as a decimal fraction.

Interference is defined in relation to the coefficient of coincidence, $C$, by the equation:\n$$\nI = 1 - C\n$$\nThe coefficient of coincidence, $C$, is the ratio of the observed frequency of double crossover (DCO) events to the expected frequency of DCO events. The expected frequency is calculated under the assumption of no interference, i.e., that crossovers in adjacent intervals occur independently.\n$$\nC = \\frac{\\text{Observed Frequency of DCO}}{\\text{Expected Frequency of DCO}}\n$$\nTo calculate $C$, we must first determine the recombination frequencies for the two intervals, $A$–$B$ and $B$–$C$, and then determine the observed and expected frequencies of double crossovers. All frequencies will be calculated at the level of individual chromatids (spores), as this is the most fundamental level.\n\nFirst, we calculate the recombination frequency ($RF$) for each interval using the provided tetrad data. The recombination frequency is the proportion of recombinant chromatids among the total population of chromatids. In a total of $N$ tetrads, there are $4N$ chromatids. For a given pair of markers, a Tetratype (T) tetrad contains $2$ recombinant and $2$ parental chromatids. A Nonparental Ditype (NPD) tetrad contains $4$ recombinant chromatids. A Parental Ditype (PD) tetrad contains $0$ recombinant chromatids.\n\nThe total number of recombinant chromatids for an interval is therefore $2 \\times T + 4 \\times NPD$. The recombination frequency is this count divided by the total number of chromatids, $4N$.\n$$\nRF = \\frac{2 \\times T + 4 \\times NPD}{4 \\times N} = \\frac{T + 2 \\times NPD}{2 \\times N}\n$$\nThe total number of tetrads is $N = 250$.\n\nFor the interval $A$–$B$, the data are $T_{AB} = 90$ and $NPD_{AB} = 10$.

The recombination frequency, $RF_{BC}$, is:\n$$\nRF_{BC} = \\frac{100 + 2 \\times 10}{2 \\times 250} = \\frac{100 + 20}{500} = \\frac{120}{500} = 0.24\n$$\nThe expected frequency of double crossover chromatids is the product of the individual recombination frequencies, assuming independence:\n$$\n\\text{Expected Freq(DCO)} = RF_{AB} \\times RF_{BC} = 0.22 \\times 0.24 = 0.0528\n$$\nNext, we determine the observed frequency of double crossover chromatids. The problem provides this information directly: across all tetrads, a total of $D = 35$ spores were identified as double recombinant chromatids. The total number of spores (chromatids) analyzed is $4N = 4 \\times 250 = 1000$.\nThe observed frequency of double crossover chromatids is the ratio of the number of such chromatids to the total number of chromatids:\n$$\n\\text{Observed Freq(DCO)} = \\frac{D}{4N} = \\frac{35}{1000} = 0.035\n$$\nThe assumption of no chromatid interference ensures that this frequency of double recombinant chromatids is the correct measure for the observed DCO rate at the gamete level.\n\nNow we can compute the coefficient of coincidence, $C$:\n$$\nC = \\frac{\\text{Observed Freq(DCO)}}{\\text{Expected Freq(DCO)}} = \\frac{0.035}{0.0528}\n$$\nFinally, we calculate the interference value, $I$:\n$$\nI = 1 - C = 1 - \\frac{0.035}{0.0528} \\approx 1 - 0.66287878... \\approx 0.33712121...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nI \\approx 0.3371\n$$\nThis positive value of interference indicates that a crossover in one interval ($A$–$B$) suppresses the probability of a simultaneous crossover in the adjacent interval ($B$–$C$), which is a typical finding for linked genes on a eukaryotic chromosome.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.3371}\n$$", "id": "2825657"}, {"introduction": "While tetrads often segregate in a perfect Mendelian $2{:}2$ ratio, exceptions provide deep insights into the molecular processes of recombination.

Focus on a single locus with alleles $A$ and $a$, where the diploid is heterozygous $A/a$. In the absence of gene conversion, Mendelian segregation at meiosis yields unordered tetrads with allele counts $2{:}2$.\n\nGene conversion at a locus is understood, at the molecular level, as arising from heteroduplex formation during homologous recombination and subsequent mismatch repair in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Assume a model in which, per meiosis and at the focal locus, a gene conversion event occurs with probability $c$, where $0 \\leq c \\leq 1$, and with probability $1-c$ no gene conversion occurs at the locus. When a conversion event occurs, it affects exactly one chromatid at the locus (so that double conversions at the same locus are negligible), and mismatch repair is complete and unbiased between $A$ and $a$ so that the direction of conversion is equally likely to favor either allele.

The set of alleles on the four chromatids that will be segregated into the tetrad is $\\{A, A, a, a\\}$.\n\nThe problem defines two mutually exclusive outcomes for a single meiosis at this locus: either a gene conversion event occurs, or it does not.\n\nCase 1: No gene conversion.\nThis event occurs with probability $1-c$. In the absence of gene conversion, meiosis proceeds according to Mendel's law of segregation. The two homologous chromosomes segregate in meiosis I, and sister chromatids segregate in meiosis II. The four resulting haploid spores will contain one copy of each of the four initial chromatids. Therefore, the tetrad will consist of two spores with allele $A$ and two spores with allele $a$. This corresponds to the $2{:}2$ segregation class. The frequency of this class is the probability of this event.\n$$ f_{2{:}2} = 1-c $$\n\nCase 2: A gene conversion event occurs.\nThis event occurs with total probability $c$. The problem states that the conversion is unbiased, meaning the direction of conversion is equally likely to favor either allele. This implies that there are two possible outcomes for a conversion event, each with a conditional probability of $1/2$.\n\nSubcase 2a: Conversion of $a$ to $A$.\nThe probability of a gene conversion event ($c$) combined with the specific direction $a \\to A$ (conditional probability $1/2$) is $c \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{c}{2}$. In this event, one of the two chromatids carrying the $a$ allele has its allele changed to $A$. The set of alleles on the four chromatids becomes $\\{A, A, A, a\\}$. After segregation of these four chromatids into the four spores of the tetrad, the resulting allelic ratio will be $3A{:}1a$. The frequency of this tetrad class is therefore the probability of this specific event.\n$$ f_{3{:}1} = \\frac{c}{2} $$\n\nSubcase 2b: Conversion of $A$ to $a$.\nThe probability of a gene conversion event ($c$) combined with the specific direction $A \\to a$ (conditional probability $1/2$) is also $c \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{c}{2}$.
