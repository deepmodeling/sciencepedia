This exercise challenges you to think like a molecular systems engineer and determine the minimum toolkit of tRNAs required to translate the entire protein-coding vocabulary. By applying the crucial concept of wobble pairing first proposed by Francis Crick, you will delve into the elegant efficiency underlying the final step of the central dogma. [@problem_id:2856000]", "id": "2856000", "problem": "A messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) is translated by transfer ribonucleic acids (tRNAs), each bearing a specific anticodon that base-pairs antiparallel to a codon. Assume the canonical nuclear genetic code with $61$ sense codons and $3$ stop codons, excluding recoding of selenocysteine and pyrrolysine. Base-pairing during translation follows these widely accepted, well-tested rules derived from the central dogma and Francis Crick’s wobble hypothesis:\n- Strict Watson–Crick pairing in the first two codon positions (codon positions $1$ and $2$; anticodon positions $36$ and $35$).\n- At the wobble position (codon position $3$; anticodon position $34$), allowed pairs are:\n  - Anticodon $C$ pairs with codon $G$ only.\n  - Anticodon $A$ pairs with codon $U$ only.\n  - Anticodon $U$ pairs with codon $A$ or $G$.\n  - Anticodon $G$ pairs with codon $C$ or $U$.\n  - Anticodon inosine ($I$) pairs with codon $U$, $C$, or $A$.\n- No tRNA may recognize a stop codon; release factors terminate at $UAA$, $UAG$, and $UGA$.\n\nUse the standard organization of the genetic code into $16$ “codon boxes,” each defined by the first two codon bases $XY$ and containing the four codons $XYU$, $XYC$, $XYA$, $XYG$.

Express your final answer as a single integer. No rounding is needed.", "solution": "We begin from the central dogma’s translation step: a transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) anticodon binds an mRNA codon by antiparallel base-pairing. Fidelity is high at codon positions $1$ and $2$, while position $3$ admits “wobble” pairing. Therefore, for a fixed first-two-base context $XY$ (a “codon box”), a single tRNA anticodon can potentially recognize multiple codons within that box if its wobble base at anticodon position $34$ can legally pair with the corresponding set of third codon bases.\n\nKey wobble facts we will use:\n- Anticodon $C$ recognizes only codon-third-base $G$.\n- Anticodon $A$ recognizes only codon-third-base $U$.\n- Anticodon $U$ recognizes codon-third-bases $A$ and $G$.\n- Anticodon $G$ recognizes codon-third-bases $C$ and $U$.\n- Anticodon $I$ recognizes codon-third-bases $U$, $C$, and $A$.\n\nWe also require that no tRNA recognize any stop codon; thus, any anticodon choice whose wobble pairing would erroneously read a stop codon is disallowed.\n\nStrategy. We count the minimal anticodons box-by-box, because distinct first-two-base contexts $XY$ require distinct anticodon positions $35$ and $36$, so anticodons are not reusable across boxes. For each box we find the minimal number of anticodons covering exactly the sense codons present.\n\nStep $1$: Fourfold-degenerate boxes. There are $8$ such boxes: $UC$, $CU$, $CC$, $CG$, $AC$, $GU$, $GC$, $GG$. Each contains $4$ sense codons ($XYU$, $XYC$, $XYA$, $XYG$) for the same amino acid. What is the minimum number of anticodons needed?\n\n- Any single wobble base recognizes at most $3$ distinct third bases: anticodon $I$ recognizes $\\{U,C,A\\}$ but misses $G$; anticodon $U$ recognizes $\\{A,G\\}$ (size $2$); anticodon $G$ recognizes $\\{U,C\\}$ (size $2$). Therefore, one anticodon cannot cover all $4$ codons.\n- Two anticodons suffice: choose wobble $G$ to cover $\\{U,C\\}$ and wobble $U$ to cover $\\{A,G\\}$. Together they cover $\\{U,C,A,G\\}$.\n- Minimality: impossible with $1$ anticodon, as shown; hence the minimum is $2$ per fourfold box.\n\nContribution from $8$ boxes: $8 \\times 2 = 16$ anticodons.\n\nStep $2$: Split boxes with two sense families partitioned by pyrimidine/purine at the third position. These are $UU$, $CA$, $AA$, $GA$, and $AG$. Each such box has one amino acid encoded by $XYU/XYC$ and another encoded by $XYA/XYG$.\n\n- For the $U/C$ pair, one anticodon with wobble $G$ recognizes both $U$ and $C$.\n- For the $A/G$ pair, one anticodon with wobble $U$ recognizes both $A$ and $G$.\n- No extra constraints (no stops in these halves), so each such box requires exactly $2$ anticodons.\n\nContribution from $5$ boxes: $5 \\times 2 = 10$ anticodons.\n\nStep $3$: Boxes with stops.\n(a) $UA$ box: Tyr is encoded by $UAU/UAC$; $UAA/UAG$ are stops. A single anticodon with wobble $G$ recognizes $\\{U,C\\}$ and decodes both Tyr codons. An anticodon with wobble $U$ would inappropriately recognize $\\{A,G\\}$, i.e., the stops, so it is disallowed. Therefore the minimal number is $1$.\n\nContribution: $1$.\n\n(b) $UG$ box: Cys is encoded by $UGU/UGC$, $UGA$ is a stop, $UGG$ is Trp. For Cys, one anticodon with wobble $G$ recognizes $\\{U,C\\}$. For Trp ($UGG$ only), we must choose an anticodon wobble that recognizes $G$ but not $A$, to avoid $UGA$ stop. Anticodon $U$ recognizes $\\{A,G\\}$ and would misread the stop $UGA$, so it is disallowed. Anticodon $C$ recognizes only $G$ and thus specifically reads $UGG$ without recognizing $UGA$. Hence we need $2$ anticodons total in this box.\n\nContribution: $2$.\n\n(c) $AU$ box: Ile is encoded by $AUU/AUC/AUA$, Met is encoded by $AUG$. For Ile, a single anticodon with wobble $I$ recognizes $\\{U,C,A\\}$ and crucially does not recognize $G$, so it decodes all three Ile codons but not Met. For Met ($AUG$ only), we can use anticodon wobble $C$ to recognize only $G$ (and thus not AUA). Therefore this box needs $2$ anticodons.\n\nContribution: $2$.\n\nStep $4$: Sum over all boxes. Let $N$ be the minimal number of distinct anticodons:\n- Fourfold boxes: $16$.\n- Split sense/sense boxes: $10$.\n- $UA$ (Tyr-only sense half): $1$.\n- $UG$ (Cys plus Trp, with a stop): $2$.\n- $AU$ (Ile plus Met): $2$.\n\nThus\n$$\nN \\;=\\; 16 \\;+\\; 10 \\;+\\; 1 \\;+\\; 2 \\;+\\; 2 \\;=\\; 31.\n$$\n\nMinimality is guaranteed by:\n- The impossibility of $1$ anticodon covering a fourfold-degenerate box under the stated wobble rules (maximum coverage size is $3$, and that misses $G$ when using $I$).\n- The necessity of one anticodon per half in split boxes to avoid cross-amino-acid decoding and to satisfy the required third-base sets $\\{U,C\\}$ and $\\{A,G\\}$.\n- The necessity in $UG$ and $AU$ boxes to avoid recognizing stops or the wrong amino acid, which fixes the wobble choice and precludes any further consolidation.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of distinct tRNA anticodons required, under the stated assumptions and wobble rules with inosine allowed, is $31$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{31}$$"}, {"introduction": "The one gene-one polypeptide concept extends beyond molecular identity to encompass quantity, as protein levels are tightly regulated.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe rate of change of the number of mRNA molecules, which we denote as $M$, is determined by the balance between its synthesis and degradation. The rate of synthesis is given as a constant transcription rate, $k_{\\mathrm{tx}}$. The degradation process follows first-order kinetics, meaning its rate is proportional to the number of mRNA molecules present, i.e., $k_{\\mathrm{deg}} M$, where $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$ is the first-order degradation rate constant. The governing differential equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{tx}} - k_{\\mathrm{deg}} M\n$$\nThe problem states that the system is at steady state. At steady state, the concentration or number of molecules is constant, which means $\\frac{dM}{dt} = 0$.

For a first-order decay process, the relationship between the half-life and the rate constant is fundamental. It is derived from the integrated rate law $M(t) = M(0) \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg}} t)$. By definition, at $t=H$, $M(H) = \\frac{M(0)}{2}$.\n$$\n\\frac{M(0)}{2} = M(0) \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg}} H)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg}} H)\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k_{\\mathrm{deg}} H\n$$\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -k_{\\mathrm{deg}} H\n$$\nThus, the rate constant is related to the half-life by:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{deg}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{H}\n$$\nWe substitute this expression for $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$ into our equation for $M_{ss}$:\n$$\nM_{ss} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tx}}}{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{H}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tx}} H}{\\ln(2)}\n$$\nThis is the steady-state number of mRNA molecules in the cell.\n\nThe protein synthesis flux, which we will denote as $J_p$, is the total rate of protein production. It is determined by the rate of protein synthesis per mRNA molecule, given as $k_{\\mathrm{init}}$, multiplied by the total number of mRNA molecules, $M_{ss}$.\n$$\nJ_p = k_{\\mathrm{init}} M_{ss}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $M_{ss}$ yields the expression for the steady-state protein synthesis flux:\n$$\nJ_p = k_{\\mathrm{init}} \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tx}} H}{\\ln(2)} \\right) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tx}} k_{\\mathrm{init}} H}{\\ln(2)}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\nThe second part requires calculating the fold-change in this flux under new conditions.

In C$2$, the net frameshift is $(+1-4)\\bmod 3\\equiv 0$, and the $4$-nucleotide deletion occurs before the first stop codon in the shifted frame; therefore, the original reading frame is restored prior to encountering any stop codon, translation proceeds to the canonical stop in exon $3$, and the resulting protein is near full-length with an internal segment of altered amino acid sequence between the indels.

The parameters and rules given (e.g., the \"$50$-nucleotide rule\") are standard representations used in genetics. The problem does not violate fundamental scientific laws.\n2.  **Non-Formalizable or Irrelevant**: The problem is highly formalizable, involving precise locations, lengths, and rules that can be modeled computationally and logically. It is directly relevant to the topic of gene expression and mutation.\n3.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: The setup is detailed and self-contained. It provides all necessary information about the gene structure, mutation types, and the crucial NMD rule. There are no apparent contradictions in the provided data.\n4.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The defined gene structure and mutations are biologically plausible. Frameshift mutations and NMD are common phenomena.\n5.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured**: The problem is well-posed. Given the rules, the outcome for each construct can be uniquely determined. The language is precise, although some phrasing might require careful interpretation (e.g., \"downstream of the insertion site\").\n6.  **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological**: The problem is not trivial. It requires integrating multiple concepts: frameshift mechanics, the location of termination codons, and the positional dependence of the NMD surveillance mechanism.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: The claims and outcomes are verifiable through the application of molecular genetics principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nFirst, establish the coordinate system for the gene based on the givens. The coding sequence (cDNA) spans positions $1$ through $900$.\n- **Exon 1**: Positions $1$ to $150$.\n- **Exon 2**: Positions $151$ to $450$ (length $450 - 151 + 1 = 300$).\n- **Exon 3**: Positions $451$ to $900$ (length $900 - 451 + 1 = 450$).\n\nThe junctions between exons are located after positions $150$ and $450$. The **final exon-exon junction** is therefore the one between exon $2$ and exon $3$, located after cDNA position $450$.\n\nThe NMD rule states that a PTC more than $50$ nucleotides upstream of this final junction triggers mRNA degradation. The boundary position is $450 - 50 = 400$. Therefore, any PTC whose first nucleotide is at or before position $400$ in the cDNA will trigger NMD.\n\nNow, we evaluate each construct and the corresponding statement.\n\n**Analysis of Construct C$1$**\n- A single-nucleotide insertion at position $201$ (within exon $2$) creates a $+1$ frameshift.\n- A stop codon appears $45$ codons downstream in this new frame. The distance in nucleotides is $45 \\times 3 = 135$ nucleotides.\n- The position of this premature termination codon (PTC) is calculated relative to the insertion point. The first nucleotide of the PTC is at position $201 + 135 = 336$.\n- This PTC is at position $336$, which lies within exon $2$ (positions $151$-$450$).\n- To determine if NMD is triggered, we compare the PTC position to the NMD boundary: $336 \\le 400$.\n- Since the PTC is more than $50$ nt upstream of the final junction ($450 - 336 = 114$ nt), the mRNA is a substrate for NMD and is expected to be degraded.\n- If the mRNA is degraded, no stable protein product is made. No downstream events, such as a hypothetical frame restoration, can occur on this molecule.\n\n**Evaluation of Option A**\nThe statement claims that in C$1$, translation terminates within exon $2$, the PTC is positioned correctly to trigger NMD, and consequently, no downstream frame restoration is possible. Our analysis confirms every part of this statement. The termination is at position $336$ (in exon $2$). The PTC triggers NMD ($336 \\le 400$). The degradation of the mRNA template precludes any further translational events.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Analysis of Construct C$2$**\n- This construct has two modifications within exon $2$: a $+1$ insertion at position $201$ and a $-4$ deletion at position $231$.\n- The ribosome first encounters the $+1$ insertion at position $201$, shifting the reading frame by $+1$.\n- It then encounters the $-4$ deletion at position $231$. A deletion of $k$ nucleotides shifts the reading frame by $-k$. Thus, a $4$-nucleotide deletion shifts the frame by $-4 \\pmod 3 \\equiv -1$.\n- The net frameshift after position $231$ is the sum of the individual shifts: $(+1) + (-1) = 0$. The original reading frame is restored.\n- The problem states that a PTC exists in the $+1$ frame at a position corresponding to $336$ of the original sequence. However, the restorative deletion occurs at position $231$. Since $231 < 336$, the reading frame is corrected *before* the ribosome reaches the sequence that would have coded for a stop codon in the $+1$ frame.\n- Therefore, the ribosome does not encounter a PTC. Translation continues in the restored original frame until the canonical stop codon at the end of exon $3$.\n- Because no PTC is encountered during translation, NMD is not triggered.\n- The resulting protein will have a length close to wild-type. The net change in coding sequence length is $+1 - 4 = -3$ nucleotides, which corresponds to a deletion of one amino acid. The protein will be $299$ amino acids long instead of $300$. The amino acid sequence between positions $201$ and $231$ will be altered due to the frameshift in that segment.\n\n**Evaluation of Option B**\nThe statement posits that the net frameshift is restored because $(+1-4) \\pmod 3 = 0$. This correctly identifies the condition for frame restoration based on net length change. It correctly notes that the restoration occurs before the potential PTC, allowing translation to proceed to the end and produce a near-full-length protein with an altered internal sequence. It correctly concludes that NMD is unlikely. Every part of the reasoning is sound.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Analysis of Construct C$3$**\n- This construct has a $+1$ insertion at position $201$ (exon $2$) and a $-2$ deletion at position $501$ (exon $3$).\n- The ribosome encounters the $+1$ insertion at $201$ and shifts into the $+1$ frame.\n- As with C$1$, this leads to the generation of a PTC at position $336$.\n- Translation terminates at this PTC. The ribosome dissociates from the mRNA.\n- The second indel, the $-2$ deletion at position $501$, is never reached by the translating ribosome. It cannot compensate for the initial frameshift.\n- The PTC at position $336$ will trigger NMD, as $336 \\le 400$.\n\n**Evaluation of Option C**\nThis statement claims the ribosome can \"read through\" the PTC in exon $2$ to reach the compensatory deletion in exon $3$. This is fundamentally incorrect. The canonical function of a stop codon is to terminate translation. Ribosomal read-through is a rare, context-dependent phenomenon not implied by the problem statement. Termination at the PTC is the standard outcome. Consequently, a full-length protein is not produced, and NMD is triggered, contrary to the statement's claims.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Evaluation of Option D**\nThis statement makes two general claims. First, that a pair of indels restoring the frame will also restore the exact wild-type amino acid sequence *between* the indels. This is false. In the region between two compensatory indels, the reading frame is shifted, leading to a completely different sequence of amino acids. Second, it claims this restoration is independent of stop codons in the interim. This is also false, as demonstrated by construct C$3$, where an intervening PTC prevents the ribosome from ever reaching the second, compensatory indel.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Evaluation of Option E**\nThis statement provides a general summary of the rules governing the rescue of protein production by compensatory indels.\n1.  \"...depends not only on whether their net length is a multiple of $3$...\" — This is the primary condition for frame restoration. This is correct.\n2.  \"...but also on whether a premature termination codon is encountered before the compensating event...\" — This is the critical distinction between the outcomes of C$2$ (rescue succeeds) and C$3$ (rescue fails). This is correct.\n3.  \"...and on the position of that premature termination codon relative to the final exon–exon junction (the $50$-nucleotide rule for NMD).\" — This determines the fate of the mRNA itself. If a PTC is encountered, its position dictates whether the mRNA is degraded via NMD, which is a prerequisite for producing any protein product, truncated or otherwise. This is correct.\nThe statement is a complete and accurate synthesis of the principles demonstrated in the problem.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nFinal review indicates that statements A, B, and E are correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABE}$$"}]}
