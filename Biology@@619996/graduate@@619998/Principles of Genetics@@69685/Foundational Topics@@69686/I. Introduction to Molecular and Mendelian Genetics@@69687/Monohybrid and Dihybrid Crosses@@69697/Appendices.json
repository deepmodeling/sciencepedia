Express your final answer as a reduced rational number with no units.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid and well-posed. It is a standard problem in elementary genetics that can be solved rigorously from first principles using the axioms of probability. We will derive the solution step by step.\n\nThe cross involves two parents, each with genotype $AaBb$. The loci $A$ and $B$ are unlinked, which means they assort independently, as stated by Mendel’s Law of Independent Assortment. This allows us to analyze the inheritance of each locus as a separate, independent probabilistic event. The overall probability of a combined phenotype is the product of the probabilities of the individual phenotypes.\n\nFirst, consider the monohybrid cross for locus $A$: $Aa \\times Aa$.\nAccording to Mendel’s Law of Segregation, each parent produces two types of gametes, one carrying the allele $A$ and the other carrying the allele $a$. The probability for each type of gamete is $1/2$. We denote these probabilities as $P(A) = 1/2$ and $P(a) = 1/2$.\nThe probabilities of the offspring genotypes at this locus are calculated by considering the random fusion of these gametes:\nThe probability of genotype $AA$ is $P(AA) = P(A) \\times P(A) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThe probability of genotype $Aa$ is $P(Aa) = (P(A) \\times P(a)) + (P(a) \\times P(A)) = (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe probability of genotype $aa$ is $P(aa) = P(a) \\times P(a) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThe sum of probabilities is $P(AA) + P(Aa) + P(aa) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$, which is correct.\n\nWith complete dominance, the allele $A$ is dominant over $a$. The dominant phenotype (denoted $A_-$) is expressed by genotypes $AA$ and $Aa$. The recessive phenotype is expressed only by genotype $aa$.\nThe probability of an offspring having the dominant phenotype at locus $A$ is:\n$P(A_-) = P(AA) + P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\nThe probability of an offspring having the recessive phenotype at locus $A$ is:\n$P(aa) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nSecond, we perform an identical analysis for locus $B$. The cross is $Bb \\times Bb$. The genetic principles are the same.\nThe probability of an offspring having the dominant phenotype at locus $B$ (denoted $B_-$) is:\n$P(B_-) = \\frac{3}{4}$.\nThe probability of an offspring having the recessive phenotype at locus $B$ (genotype $bb$) is:\n$P(bb) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that a randomly chosen offspring is recessive at *exactly one* locus. This outcome can occur in two mutually exclusive ways:\n$1$. The offspring is recessive at locus $A$ (phenotype $aa$) AND dominant at locus $B$ (phenotype $B_-$).\n$2$. The offspring is dominant at locus $A$ (phenotype $A_-$) AND recessive at locus $B$ (phenotype $bb$).\n\nLet $E$ be the event that the offspring is recessive at exactly one locus. Let $E_1$ be the first case and $E_2$ be the second case. Since these cases are mutually exclusive, the total probability is the sum of their individual probabilities:\n$P(E) = P(E_1) + P(E_2)$.\n\nBecause the loci are unlinked and assort independently, the joint probability for a combination of phenotypes is the product of their marginal probabilities.\nFor case $1$, the probability is:\n$P(E_1) = P(aa \\text{ and } B_-) = P(aa) \\times P(B_-) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3}{16}$.\n\nFor case $2$, the probability is:\n$P(E_2) = P(A_- \\text{ and } bb) = P(A_-) \\times P(bb) = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{16}$.\n\nThe total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two disjoint events:\n$P(E) = P(E_1) + P(E_2) = \\frac{3}{16} + \\frac{3}{16} = \\frac{6}{16}$.\n\nFinally, the problem requires the answer to be expressed as a reduced rational number.\n$P(E) = \\frac{6}{16} = \\frac{3}{8}$.\nThis is the probability that an offspring from a $AaBb \\times AaBb$ cross exhibits a recessive phenotype at exactly one of the two loci.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}$$", "id": "2831634"}, {"introduction": "While classic Mendelian genetics provides a powerful foundation, the relationship between genotype and phenotype is often not deterministic.
