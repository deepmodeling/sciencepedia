Upon shifting to high ionic strength, a fraction $f = 0.20$ of its base pairs adopts the left-handed Z-form, while the remainder stays in B-form.

Use the widely accepted helical repeats for the two forms: for B-DNA, $h_{B} = 10.5$ base pairs per helical turn; for Z-DNA, $h_{Z} = -12.0$ base pairs per helical turn (the negative sign encodes left-handedness under the convention that right-handed twist is positive).

Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. All data and definitions required for a unique solution are provided. The values for helical repeats are standard, and the scenario of B-Z transition in a covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is a classic problem in the study of DNA topology. The problem is valid.\n\nThe fundamental relationship governing the topology of cccDNA is White's formula:\n$$Lk = Tw + Wr$$\nwhere $Lk$ is the linking number (an integer constant for a cccDNA), $Tw$ is the twist (the total number of helical turns), and $Wr$ is the writhe (a measure of the coiling of the helix axis in space).\n\nFirst, we must determine the initial state of the plasmid. It is given as a relaxed, B-form DNA of length $N = 3{,}150$ base pairs. In a relaxed state, the molecule is assumed to have no supercoiling, so its writhe is zero ($Wr_{initial} = 0$). The linking number is therefore equal to the twist.\nThe initial twist, $Tw_{initial}$, for a B-form DNA is the total number of base pairs, $N$, divided by the helical repeat of B-DNA, $h_{B} = 10.5$ bp/turn.\n$$Lk = Tw_{initial} = \\frac{N}{h_{B}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$Lk = \\frac{3{,}150}{10.5} = 300$$\nSince no strand breaks occur during the transition to high ionic strength, this linking number $Lk = 300$ is a conserved topological invariant for the plasmid.\n\nNext, we establish the reference state for the superhelical density calculation. The problem defines this \"relaxed reference\" state at high ionic strength as a hypothetical, writhe-free molecule ($Wr_{ref} = 0$) where a fraction $f = 0.20$ of the DNA is in the Z-form and the remaining fraction ($1-f$) is in the B-form. The linking number of this reference state, denoted $Lk_0$, is therefore equal to its total twist, $Tw_0$.\n\nThe total twist $Tw_0$ is the sum of the twist contributions from the B-form and Z-form segments.\nThe number of base pairs in the B-form segment is $N_B = N(1-f)$.\nThe number of base pairs in the Z-form segment is $N_Z = N f$.\n\nThe twist of the B-form segment is $Tw_B = \\frac{N_B}{h_B} = \\frac{N(1-f)}{h_B}$.\nThe twist of the Z-form segment is $Tw_Z = \\frac{N_Z}{h_Z} = \\frac{Nf}{h_Z}$. Note that $h_Z = -12.0$ bp/turn is negative, correctly reflecting the left-handed nature of the Z-helix.\n\nThe reference linking number $Lk_0$ is:\n$$Lk_0 = Tw_0 = Tw_B + Tw_Z = \\frac{N(1-f)}{h_B} + \\frac{Nf}{h_Z}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$Lk_0 = \\frac{3{,}150 \\times (1 - 0.20)}{10.5} + \\frac{3{,}150 \\times 0.20}{-12.0}$$\n$$Lk_0 = \\frac{3{,}150 \\times 0.80}{10.5} + \\frac{3{,}150 \\times 0.20}{-12.0}$$\n$$Lk_0 = \\frac{2{,}520}{10.5} - \\frac{630}{12.0} = 240 - 52.5 = 187.5$$\n\nThe linking difference, $\\Delta Lk$, is the difference between the actual linking number of the plasmid, $Lk$, and the linking number of its relaxed reference state, $Lk_0$.\n$$\\Delta Lk = Lk - Lk_0$$\n$$\\Delta Lk = 300 - 187.5 = 112.5$$\nThis $\\Delta Lk$ represents the number of supercoils (a combination of twist and writhe) introduced into the molecule due to the B-Z transition relative to the new relaxed reference state.\n\nFinally, the superhelical density, $\\sigma$, is defined as the linking difference normalized by the reference linking number.\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{\\Delta Lk}{Lk_0}$$\nIt is also possible to derive a general expression for $\\sigma$ independent of $N$:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{Lk - Lk_0}{Lk_0} = \\frac{\\frac{N}{h_B} - \\left(\\frac{N(1-f)}{h_B} + \\frac{Nf}{h_Z}\\right)}{\\frac{N(1-f)}{h_B} + \\frac{f}{h_Z}}$$\nThe factor $N$ cancels from the numerator and denominator:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{\\frac{1}{h_B} - \\frac{1-f}{h_B} - \\frac{f}{h_Z}}{\\frac{1-f}{h_B} + \\frac{f}{h_Z}} = \\frac{\\frac{f}{h_B} - \\frac{f}{h_Z}}{\\frac{1-f}{h_B} + \\frac{f}{h_Z}} = \\frac{f\\left(\\frac{1}{h_B} - \\frac{1}{h_Z}\\right)}{\\frac{1-f}{h_B} + \\frac{f}{h_Z}}$$\nUsing the numerical values:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{112.5}{187.5} = 0.6$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

The problem states that the standard molar enthalpy change, $\\Delta H^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{fold}}$, and the standard molar entropy change, $\\Delta S^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{fold}}$, for the reaction are constant over the temperature range of interest. Therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\circ}(T) = \\Delta H^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{fold}} - T \\Delta S^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{fold}}\n$$\nAt the melting temperature $T = T_{m}$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\circ}(T_{m}) = \\Delta H^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{fold}} - T_{m} \\Delta S^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{fold}}\n$$\nWe now have two expressions for $\\Delta G^{\\circ}(T_{m})$. Equating them allows us to solve for $T_{m}$:\n$$\n\\Delta H^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{fold}} - T_{m} \\Delta S^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{fold}} = -m R T_{m} \\cdot \\mathrm{pH} \\cdot \\ln(10)\n$$\nTo isolate $T_{m}$, we rearrange the terms:\n$$\n\\Delta H^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{fold}} = T_{m} \\Delta S^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{fold}} - m R T_{m} \\cdot \\mathrm{pH} \\cdot \\ln(10)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta H^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{fold}} = T_{m} (\\Delta S^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{fold}} - m R \\cdot \\mathrm{pH} \\cdot \\ln(10))\n$$\nThis leads to the final analytical expression for the melting temperature as a function of $\\mathrm{pH}$:\n$$\nT_{m}(\\mathrm{pH}) = \\frac{\\Delta H^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{fold}}}{\\Delta S^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{fold}} - m R \\cdot \\mathrm{pH} \\cdot \\ln(10)}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the provided numerical data:\n- $\\Delta H^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{fold}} = -6.00 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $\\Delta S^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{fold}} = -1.514 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n- $m = 4$\n- $R = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n- $\\mathrm{pH} = 5.50$\n\nThe value of the natural logarithm of $10$ is $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$.\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $T_{m}$:\n$$\nT_{m} = \\frac{-6.00 \\times 10^{5}}{-1.514 \\times 10^{3} - (4)(8.314)(5.50)\\ln(10)}\n$$\nFirst, we calculate the term in the denominator:\n$$\nm R \\cdot \\mathrm{pH} \\cdot \\ln(10) \\approx (4)(8.314)(5.50)(2.302585) \\approx 421.144\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}\n$$\nThe denominator becomes:\n$$\n\\Delta S^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{fold}} - m R \\cdot \\mathrm{pH} \\cdot \\ln(10) \\approx -1514 - 421.144 = -1935.144\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}\n$$\nFinally, we compute $T_{m}$:\n$$\nT_{m} = \\frac{-6.00 \\times 10^{5}}{-1935.144} \\approx 310.0513\\,\\mathrm{K}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nT_{m} \\approx 310.1\\,\\mathrm{K}\n$$\nIn standard scientific notation, this is $3.101 \\times 10^2\\,\\mathrm{K}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.101 \\times 10^{2}}$$", "id": "2856674"}]}
