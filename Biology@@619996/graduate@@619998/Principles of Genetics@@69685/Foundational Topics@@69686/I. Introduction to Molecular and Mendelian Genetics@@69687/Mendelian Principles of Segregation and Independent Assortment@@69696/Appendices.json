It is a complete, consistent, and formalizable problem within the field of genetics and probability theory.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe genotype of an offspring from the testcross $AaBb \\times aabb$ is determined by the gamete contributed by the $AaBb$ parent, as the $aabb$ parent can only produce gametes of genotype $ab$. The four possible gametes from the $AaBb$ parent are $AB$, $Ab$, $aB$, and $ab$.\n\nAccording to Mendel's law of segregation, for the $A/a$ locus, the probability of an $A$ allele being in a gamete is $P(A) = \\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of an $a$ allele is $P(a) = \\frac{1}{2}$. Similarly, for the $B/b$ locus, the probability of a $B$ allele is $P(B) = \\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of a $b$ allele is $P(b) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nAccording to Mendel's law of independent assortment, the segregation of alleles at the $A/a$ locus is independent of the segregation of alleles at the $B/b$ locus. Therefore, we can calculate the probability of each gamete type by multiplying the probabilities of the constituent alleles:\n- Probability of gamete $AB$: $p_{AB} = P(A) \\times P(B) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n- Probability of gamete $Ab$: $p_{Ab} = P(A) \\times P(b) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n- Probability of gamete $aB$: $p_{aB} = P(a) \\times P(B) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n- Probability of gamete $ab$: $p_{ab} = P(a) \\times P(b) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThese probabilities correspond to the probabilities of observing an offspring in each of the four phenotypic/genotypic classes in the testcross. Let $p_k$ be the probability of an offspring belonging to class $k$, where $k \\in \\{AB, Ab, aB, ab\\}$. We have $p_{AB} = p_{Ab} = p_{aB} = p_{ab} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe problem states that there are $N$ total progeny, and each outcome is independent and identically distributed. This describes a series of $N$ Bernoulli trials for each class. For any specific class $k$, an offspring either belongs to that class (a \"success\") with probability $p_k$, or it does not (a \"failure\") with probability $1 - p_k$. The total count of successes in $N$ trials, $X_k$, therefore follows a binomial distribution, $X_k \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N, p_k)$.\n\nThe expected value (mean) of a binomial random variable $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p)$ is given by the formula $E[X] = np$.

This practice explores such a scenario, involving a recessive lethal allele that prevents homozygous dominant individuals from surviving.

Assume the following empirically supported premises, which constitute the starting point for the derivation: (i) under Mendel’s law of segregation, a heterozygote $M m$ produces gametes carrying $M$ and $m$ with equal probability $1/2$; (ii) mating combines gametes by random union; (iii) viability selection removes zygotes that are homozygous for a lethal genotype before they are counted among live-born offspring; and (iv) different conceptions are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d., independent and identically distributed) with respect to genotype outcomes.\n\nSuppose that allele $M$ is dominant for a visible phenotype $X$ relative to $m$ for a visible phenotype $Y$, but that homozygotes $M M$ are embryonic lethal. Thus, at the level of live-born offspring, the only viable genotypes are $M m$ (which express phenotype $X$) and $m m$ (which express phenotype $Y$). Construct a cross that yields a viable phenotypic ratio of $2:1$ for $X:Y$ among live-born offspring based solely on the above premises, and derive, from first principles, the distribution of viable phenotypes implied by Mendelian segregation coupled with the lethal class being removed prior to observation.\n\nNow consider $N$ live-born offspring obtained by pooling many replicate matings of the same cross, with $N$ fixed in advance by design as the number of observed viable individuals. Using only the premises listed above and standard probability rules (e.g., conditional probability and independence), compute the following as closed-form analytic expressions in terms of $N$:\n- the expected count of phenotype $X$ among the $N$ live-born offspring,\n- the expected count of phenotype $Y$ among the $N$ live-born offspring,\n- the variance of the count of phenotype $X$ among the $N$ live-born offspring.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single row matrix containing the three requested quantities, in the order listed above. No numerical approximation or rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded in the principles of Mendelian genetics. A systematic derivation from the provided premises is required.\n\nFirst, we must identify a cross that can produce the specified viable phenotypes and the lethal genotype. The viable phenotypes correspond to genotypes $M m$ (phenotype $X$) and $m m$ (phenotype $Y$). The lethal genotype is $M M$. For an offspring to have genotype $M M$, both parents must contribute an $M$ allele. For an offspring to have genotype $m m$, both parents must contribute an $m$ allele. Therefore, both parents must carry both the $M$ and $m$ alleles. The only viable genotype that satisfies this condition is the heterozygote, $M m$. Thus, the required cross must be between two heterozygotes: $M m \\times M m$.\n\nWe now derive the distribution of genotypes at conception from this cross, based on premise (i), the law of segregation, and premise (ii), random union of gametes. Each $M m$ parent produces gametes carrying the $M$ allele with probability $p_M = 1/2$ and gametes carrying the $m$ allele with probability $p_m = 1/2$. The probabilities of the resulting zygotic genotypes are calculated by the product rule for independent events (random union):\n-   Probability of genotype $M M$: $P(MM) = p_M \\times p_M = (1/2) \\times (1/2) = 1/4$.\n-   Probability of genotype $M m$: $P(Mm) = (p_M \\times p_m) + (p_m \\times p_M) = (1/2)(1/2) + (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2$.\n-   Probability of genotype $m m$: $P(mm) = p_m \\times p_m = (1/2) \\times (1/2) = 1/4$.\nThe sum of these probabilities is $1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1$, as expected.\n\nNext, we apply premise (iii), which states that $M M$ zygotes are embryonic lethal and are removed before observation among live-born offspring. The set of viable genotypes is $\\{M m, m m\\}$. The total probability of a conception resulting in a viable offspring is the sum of the probabilities of the viable genotypes:\n$$P(\\text{viable}) = P(Mm) + P(mm) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the phenotypic ratio among live-born offspring. This requires us to compute the conditional probabilities of the viable genotypes, given that an offspring is viable. Let $p_X$ be the probability that a live-born offspring has phenotype $X$ (genotype $M m$), and $p_Y$ be the probability that it has phenotype $Y$ (genotype $m m$). Using the definition of conditional probability, $P(A|B) = P(A \\cap B) / P(B)$:\n$$p_X = P(Mm | \\text{viable}) = \\frac{P(Mm \\cap \\text{viable})}{P(\\text{viable})}$$\nSince the genotype $M m$ is viable, the event \"genotype is $M m$\" is a subset of the event \"offspring is viable\", so $P(Mm \\cap \\text{viable}) = P(Mm) = 1/2$. Therefore:\n$$p_X = \\frac{P(Mm)}{P(\\text{viable})} = \\frac{1/2}{3/4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nSimilarly, for phenotype $Y$:\n$$p_Y = P(mm | \\text{viable}) = \\frac{P(mm)}{P(\\text{viable})} = \\frac{1/4}{3/4} = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThe probabilities sum to unity: $p_X + p_Y = 2/3 + 1/3 = 1$. The ratio of probabilities for phenotypes $X$ and $Y$ among viable offspring is $p_X : p_Y = (2/3) : (1/3)$, which is equivalent to $2:1$. This confirms that the $M m \\times M m$ cross, coupled with the lethal allele, produces the required $2:1$ phenotypic ratio.\n\nNow, we consider a sample of $N$ live-born offspring from such crosses. According to premise (iv), the genotypes of these $N$ offspring are independent and identically distributed draws from the conditional distribution derived above. Let $K_X$ be the random variable representing the count of phenotype $X$ offspring, and $K_Y$ be the count of phenotype $Y$ offspring. The total number of observed offspring is fixed at $N$, so $K_X + K_Y = N$.\n\nEach of the $N$ observations is an independent Bernoulli trial, where \"success\" is observing phenotype $X$ with probability $p = p_X = 2/3$, and \"failure\" is observing phenotype $Y$ with probability $1-p = p_Y = 1/3$. The total count of successes, $K_X$, in $N$ fixed trials follows a binomial distribution:\n$$K_X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N, p)$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of trials and $p = 2/3$ is the probability of success.\n\nWe are asked to compute three quantities:\n1.  The expected count of phenotype $X$, $E[K_X]$. For a binomial distribution, the expected value is given by $N p$.\n$$E[K_X] = N p = N \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2N}{3}$$\n\n2.  The expected count of phenotype $Y$, $E[K_Y]$. Since $K_Y = N - K_X$, we can use the linearity of expectation:\n$$E[K_Y] = E[N - K_X] = E[N] - E[K_X] = N - \\frac{2N}{3} = \\frac{N}{3}$$\nAlternatively, $K_Y$ follows a $\\text{Binomial}(N, 1-p)$ distribution, so its expectation is $N(1-p) = N(1/3) = N/3$.\n\n3.  The variance of the count of phenotype $X$, $\\text{Var}(K_X)$.

The problem is scientifically grounded, as it employs fundamental concepts from Mendelian and quantitative genetics, specifically the law of segregation and the partitioning of phenotypic variance. The model $Y = \\mu_g + \\varepsilon$ is a standard and foundational model in quantitative genetics. The problem is well-posed; it provides all necessary information and assumptions (e.g., a specific cross, a defined genetic model, statistical properties of environmental effects) to derive a unique analytical solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is not trivial, as it requires a correct application of probability theory and the law of total variance to partition the phenotypic variance into its genetic and environmental components. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nI shall now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is structured in two parts. The first part establishes the Mendelian basis of the cross, and the second part builds a quantitative model upon it.\n\nFor Part $1$, we consider the backcross $Aa \\times aa$. The parent with genotype $Aa$ is heterozygous and, according to Mendel's law of segregation under the assumption of no segregation distortion, produces two types of gametes, $A$ and $a$, in equal proportions. The probability of producing an $A$ gamete is $P(A) = 1/2$, and the probability of producing an $a$ gamete is $P(a) = 1/2$. The parent with genotype $aa$ is homozygous recessive and can only produce one type of gamete, $a$, with probability $P(a) = 1$.\n\nThe genotypes of the progeny are determined by the random union of these gametes. We can construct a Punnett square to visualize this:\n\n| Gamete from $Aa$ | Gamete from $aa$ | Progeny Genotype | Probability |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $A$ | $a$ | $Aa$ | $1/2 \\times 1 = 1/2$ |\n| $a$ | $a$ | $aa$ | $1/2 \\times 1 = 1/2$ |\n\nThus, the expected genotype distribution among the progeny is $1/2$ for $Aa$ and $1/2$ for $aa$. With the assumption of a very large progeny, these expected probabilities can be treated as the actual frequencies of the genotypes in the population. The genotypic segregation ratio is $1$ $Aa$ : $1$ $aa$.\n\nUnder complete dominance of $A$ over $a$ with complete penetrance, the genotype $Aa$ expresses the dominant phenotype (let us call this phenotype $[A]$), and the genotype $aa$ expresses the recessive phenotype (phenotype $[a]$). Therefore, the phenotypic classes are $[A]$ and $[a]$. The frequency of phenotype $[A]$ is equal to the frequency of genotype $Aa$, which is $1/2$. The frequency of phenotype $[a]$ is equal to the frequency of genotype $aa$, which is $1/2$. The expected phenotypic segregation ratio is therefore $1 [A] : 1 [a]$.\n\nFor Part 2, we are tasked with deriving the theoretical population variance of the trait $Y$, denoted as $Var(Y)$. The total variance of a variable that depends on another random variable can be decomposed using the law of total variance. In our context, the phenotype $Y$ depends on the genotype $G$. The law states:\n$$\nVar(Y) = E[Var(Y \\mid G)] + Var(E[Y \\mid G])\n$$\nHere, $G$ is a random variable representing the genotype, which can take values $aa$ or $Aa$ with probabilities derived in Part $1$. Specifically, $P(G=aa) = 1/2$ and $P(G=Aa) = 1/2$.\n\nLet us analyze each term separately.\n\nThe first term, $E[Var(Y \\mid G)]$, is the expected value of the conditional variance of $Y$ given the genotype $G$. This is the portion of the variance due to environmental effects, often called the environmental variance, $Var_E$.\nFor a specific genotype $g$, the phenotype is given by $Y \\mid g = \\mu_g + \\varepsilon$. The variance of $Y$ conditional on $g$ is:\n$$\nVar(Y \\mid g) = Var(\\mu_g + \\varepsilon \\mid g)\n$$\nSince $\\mu_g$ is a constant for a given genotype $g$, and $\\varepsilon$ is independent of genotype, this simplifies to:\n$$\nVar(Y \\mid g) = Var(\\varepsilon) = \\sigma^2\n$$\nThis conditional variance is $\\sigma^2$ for both genotypes, $g=aa$ and $g=Aa$. Therefore, the random variable $Var(Y \\mid G)$ is a constant, $\\sigma^2$. The expectation of a constant is the constant itself:\n$$\nE[Var(Y \\mid G)] = E[\\sigma^2] = \\sigma^2\n$$\n\nThe second term, $Var(E[Y \\mid G])$, is the variance of the conditional expectation of $Y$ given the genotype $G$. This is the portion of the variance due to genetic differences among individuals, often called the genetic variance, $Var_G$.\nFirst, we find the conditional expectation $E[Y \\mid g]$:\n$$\nE[Y \\mid g] = E[\\mu_g + \\varepsilon \\mid g] = E[\\mu_g \\mid g] + E[\\varepsilon \\mid g]\n$$\nSince $\\mu_g$ is a constant for a given $g$ and $\\varepsilon$ has a mean of $0$ and is independent of $g$, we get:\n$$\nE[Y \\mid g] = \\mu_g + 0 = \\mu_g\n$$\nSo, we need to find the variance of the random variable $M = E[Y \\mid G]$, which takes the value $\\mu_{aa}$ with probability $1/2$ and $\\mu_{Aa}$ with probability $1/2$.\nTo calculate $Var(M)$, we first find its mean, $E[M]$:\n$$\nE[M] = \\mu_{aa} \\cdot P(G=aa) + \\mu_{Aa} \\cdot P(G=Aa) = \\mu_{aa} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + \\mu_{Aa} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mu_{aa} + \\mu_{Aa})\n$$\nThe variance is given by $Var(M) = E[M^2] - (E[M])^2$. Let's compute $E[M^2]$:\n$$\nE[M^2] = (\\mu_{aa})^2 \\cdot P(G=aa) + (\\mu_{Aa})^2 \\cdot P(G=Aa) = (\\mu_{aa})^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + (\\mu_{Aa})^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}((\\mu_{aa})^2 + (\\mu_{Aa})^2)\n$$\nNow, we can compute the variance:\n$$\nVar(M) = \\frac{1}{2}((\\mu_{aa})^2 + (\\mu_{Aa})^2) - \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(\\mu_{aa} + \\mu_{Aa}) \\right)^2\n$$\n$$\nVar(M) = \\frac{1}{2}((\\mu_{aa})^2 + (\\mu_{Aa})^2) - \\frac{1}{4}((\\mu_{aa})^2 + 2\\mu_{aa}\\mu_{Aa} + (\\mu_{Aa})^2)\n$$\nPutting everything over a common denominator of $4$:\n$$\nVar(M) = \\frac{2((\\mu_{aa})^2 + (\\mu_{Aa})^2) - ((\\mu_{aa})^2 + 2\\mu_{aa}\\mu_{Aa} + (\\mu_{Aa})^2)}{4}\n$$\n$$\nVar(M) = \\frac{2(\\mu_{aa})^2 + 2(\\mu_{Aa})^2 - (\\mu_{aa})^2 - 2\\mu_{aa}\\mu_{Aa} - (\\mu_{Aa})^2}{4}\n$$\n$$\nVar(M) = \\frac{(\\mu_{Aa})^2 - 2\\mu_{aa}\\mu_{Aa} + (\\mu_{aa})^2}{4} = \\frac{(\\mu_{Aa} - \\mu_{aa})^2}{4}\n$$\nThe problem defines $\\Delta := \\mu_{Aa} - \\mu_{aa}$. Substituting this definition, we get:\n$$\nVar(E[Y \\mid G]) = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{4}\n$$\n\nFinally, we combine the two components to find the total phenotypic variance $Var(Y)$:\n$$\nVar(Y) = E[Var(Y \\mid G)] + Var(E[Y \\mid G]) = \\sigma^2 + \\frac{\\Delta^2}{4}\n$$\nThe theoretical population variance of $Y$ among the backcross progeny is the sum of the environmental variance $\\sigma^2$ and the genetic variance $\\frac{\\Delta^2}{4}$. This expression is a function of only $\\Delta$ and $\\sigma^2$ as required.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{\\Delta^{2}}{4} + \\sigma^{2}} $$", "id": "2828768"}]}
