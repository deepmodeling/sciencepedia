After exon ligation, Exon Junction Complexes (EJCs) are deposited a characteristic distance upstream of each exon–exon junction. During the pioneer round of translation, ribosomes remove EJCs that they traverse. Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) is a translation-dependent quality-control pathway that is triggered when translation terminates prematurely while at least one downstream EJC remains sufficiently far from the terminating ribosome to enable productive interaction between the termination Surveillance Complex (often termed the SURF complex, containing Up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1) and Eukaryotic Release Factors (eRF1 and eRF3)) and the EJC (via UPF2 and UPF3), rather than being suppressed by Poly(A)-Binding Protein Cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1) near a normal stop codon.\n\nAssume the following empirically supported features and simplifications:\n- EJCs are deposited exactly $e$ nucleotides upstream of each exon–exon junction and are removed by any translating ribosome that passes through them.\n- NMD is triggered if and only if, at premature termination position $x$ (measured in nucleotides from the start codon along the coding sequence), there exists at least one downstream EJC whose position is at least $s$ nucleotides downstream of $x$.

The problem is self-contained, scientifically sound within its defined model, and mathematically well-posed. It requires the application of basic probability theory to a simplified but realistic biological scenario. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nFirst, we establish a coordinate system for the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) coding sequence (CDS). Let the start codon correspond to position $0$ and the end of the CDS be at position $L$. The position of a premature termination codon (PTC), denoted by $x$, is a point within the interval $\\left[0, L\\right)$. The total length of the CDS is the sum of the lengths of its $E$ exons:\n$$L = \\sum_{i=1}^{E} l_{i}$$\n\nThe transcript has $E-1$ exon–exon junctions. The position of the $k$-th junction, $P_{J_k}$, which separates exon $k$ from exon $k+1$, is located at the cumulative length of the preceding exons:\n$$P_{J_k} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} l_{i}$$\nwhere $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, E-1\\}$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, an Exon Junction Complex (EJC) is deposited a distance $e$ upstream of each junction. The position of the EJC associated with the $k$-th junction, $P_{\\text{EJC}_k}$, is therefore:\n$$P_{\\text{EJC}_k} = P_{J_k} - e = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} l_{i}\\right) - e$$\n\nThe NMD pathway is triggered if a ribosome terminates translation at a PTC at position $x$, and at least one EJC remains downstream, sufficiently far from the termination site. During translation, the ribosome removes all EJCs it traverses. Thus, for a PTC at position $x$, the set of remaining EJCs are those for which $P_{\\text{EJC}_k} > x$. The condition for NMD triggering states that for at least one of these remaining EJCs, its distance from the PTC must be at least $s$. This can be formulated as follows:\nNMD is triggered if and only if there exists a $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, E-1\\}$ such that two conditions are met:\n1. The EJC is downstream of the PTC: $P_{\\text{EJC}_k} > x$.\n2. The separation between the EJC and the PTC is sufficient: $P_{\\text{EJC}_k} - x \\ge s$.\n\nThe second condition, $x \\le P_{\\text{EJC}_k} - s$, is more restrictive and implies the first, provided that $s > 0$. Since $s=50$, this is the case. Therefore, the overall condition for NMD triggering simplifies to the existence of an index $k$ such that:\n$$x \\le P_{\\text{EJC}_k} - s$$\n\nThis means that NMD is triggered if the PTC position $x$ is less than or equal to at least one of the values in the set $\\{P_{\\text{EJC}_1} - s, P_{\\text{EJC}_2} - s, \\dots, P_{\\text{EJC}_{E-1}} - s\\}$. This is a logical OR condition. If a number is less than or equal to at least one value in a set, it must be less than or equal to the maximum value in that set. Thus, the condition is equivalent to:\n$$x \\le \\max_{k \\in \\{1, \\dots, E-1\\}} \\left( P_{\\text{EJC}_k} - s \\right)$$\n\nThe exon lengths $l_i$ are all positive. Consequently, the junction positions $P_{J_k}$ are strictly increasing with $k$. This implies that the EJC positions $P_{\\text{EJC}_k} = P_{J_k} - e$ are also strictly increasing with $k$. Therefore, the maximum value in the set corresponds to the largest index, $k = E-1$. This is the EJC deposited at the last exon–exon junction. The condition for NMD triggering reduces to a single inequality:\n$$x \\le P_{\\text{EJC}_{E-1}} - s$$\nThis completes the first part of the derivation. The PTC must occur at or before a position $s$ nucleotides upstream of the final EJC.\n\nFor the second part, we derive a closed-form expression for the probability of NMD. The position of the PTC, $x$, is a random variable uniformly distributed on the interval $\\left[0, L\\right)$. The probability of an event for a uniform distribution is the ratio of the length of the favorable region to the length of the total sample space.\n\nThe favorable region consists of all positions $x$ that trigger NMD. This is the interval of $x$ values satisfying $x \\le P_{\\text{EJC}_{E-1}} - s$. Since $x$ cannot be negative (as it is a position), the NMD-sensitive region is $\\left[0, x_{\\text{NMD}}\\right]$, where:\n$$x_{\\text{NMD}} = P_{\\text{EJC}_{E-1}} - s = \\left(\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{E-1} l_i\\right) - e\\right) - s$$\nThe length of this favorable region is $x_{\\text{NMD}}$. The total length of the sample space is $L$. The probability, $P(\\text{NMD})$, is therefore:\n$$P(\\text{NMD}) = \\frac{x_{\\text{NMD}}}{L} = \\frac{\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{E-1} l_i\\right) - e - s}{L}$$\nSubstituting $L = \\sum_{i=1}^{E} l_i$, we obtain the closed-form expression:\n$$P(\\text{NMD}) = \\frac{\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{E-1} l_i\\right) - e - s}{\\sum_{i=1}^{E} l_i}$$\nThis expression is a function of the exon lengths $\\{l_i\\}$, the EJC offset $e$, the NMD separation distance $s$, and the total CDS length $L$ (which is dependent on $\\{l_i\\}$). This completes the second part.\n\nFor the third part, we evaluate this probability using the given numerical values:\n$E=4$, $l_1=300$, $l_2=600$, $l_3=450$, $l_4=654$.\n$e=24$.\n$s=50$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the sum of the lengths of the first $E-1=3$ exons:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{3} l_i = l_1 + l_2 + l_3 = 300 + 600 + 450 = 1350$$\nThis corresponds to the position of the last junction, $P_{J_3}$. The position of the final EJC is $P_{\\text{EJC}_3} = 1350 - e = 1350 - 24 = 1326$. The upper bound for an NMD-triggering PTC is $x_{\\text{NMD}} = P_{\\text{EJC}_3} - s = 1326 - 50 = 1276$. So, any PTC in the interval $\\left[0, 1276\\right]$ will trigger NMD.\n\nNext, we calculate the total CDS length, $L$:\n$$L = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} l_i = (l_1+l_2+l_3) + l_4 = 1350 + 654 = 2004$$\n\nThe probability is the ratio of the length of the NMD-sensitive region to the total CDS length:\n$$P(\\text{NMD}) = \\frac{x_{\\text{NMD}}}{L} = \\frac{1276}{2004}$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures:\n$$P(\\text{NMD}) = \\frac{1276}{2004} \\approx 0.6367265469...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.6367$.
