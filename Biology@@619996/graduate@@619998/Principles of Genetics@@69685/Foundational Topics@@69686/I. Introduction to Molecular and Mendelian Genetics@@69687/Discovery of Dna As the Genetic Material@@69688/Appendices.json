They prepared two separate batches of the phage. In the first batch, the phage's protein coats were labeled with the radioisotope sulfur-35 ($^{\\text{35}}\\text{S}$). In the second batch, the phage's Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) was labeled with the radioisotope phosphorus-32 ($^{\\text{32}}\\text{P}$). Each batch of labeled phages was then used to infect a separate culture of *E. coli*. After allowing time for infection to begin, the cultures were agitated in a blender to shear the phage particles from the surface of the bacterial cells. Finally, the mixtures were centrifuged to separate the heavier bacterial cells, which form a pellet at the bottom of the tube, from the lighter viral components and liquid medium, which remain in the supernatant.\n\nNow, consider a hypothetical scenario where the fundamental carrier of genetic information in the T2 bacteriophage is its protein, not its DNA.

Round your final numerical answer to three significant figures and express it in ng/mL.", "solution": "**Derivation of the Model**\nThe core of the problem lies in formalizing the relationship between DNase concentration $C$ and the resulting transforming activity $A(C)$.\nAssumption (i) states that activity is dependent on intact DNA. Let $N(C)$ be the concentration of intact transforming DNA molecules remaining after incubation with DNase at concentration $C$ for a fixed time $t$. Let $N_0$ be the initial concentration of such molecules (i.e., at $C=0$).\n\nAssumption (ii) posits a pseudo-first-order relationship with respect to $C$ for a fixed time $t$. This can be derived from a fundamental rate law. The rate of degradation of intact DNA molecules can be described by a second-order reaction:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt'} = -k' N C $$\nwhere $t'$ is the reaction time and $k'$ is the second-order rate constant. Since $C$ is held constant for any given experiment and we assume it does not change significantly during the reaction, we can integrate this equation over the fixed incubation time $t$:\n$$ \\int_{N_0}^{N(t)} \\frac{dN}{N} = \\int_{0}^{t} -k' C dt' $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\\right) = -k'Ct $$\nThe fraction of remaining intact DNA after incubation is thus:\n$$ \\frac{N(C)}{N_0} = \\exp(-k'Ct) $$\nSince the incubation time $t$ is fixed across all experiments, we can define a new composite constant $k = k't$, which has units of inverse concentration. The model simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{N(C)}{N_0} = \\exp(-kC) $$\n\n**Relating the Model to Experimental Data**\nThe measured activity $A(C)$ consists of the true transforming activity, which is proportional to $N(C)$, and a constant background floor $A_{\\min}$. Thus, $A(C) = \\alpha N(C) + A_{\\min}$, where $\\alpha$ is a proportionality constant.\nAt $C=0$, $N(0)=N_0$, and the activity is maximal, $A_{\\max} = A(0) = \\alpha N_0 + A_{\\min}$.\nThe problem requires the use of a \"baseline-corrected residual transforming activity\". Let us denote this $A'_{corr}(C)$. This is defined by subtracting the baseline and normalizing by the maximum possible signal range:\n$$ A'_{corr}(C) = \\frac{A(C) - A_{\\min}}{A_{\\max} - A_{\\min}} $$\nSubstituting the relationships for $A(C)$ and $A_{\\max}$:\n$$ A'_{corr}(C) = \\frac{(\\alpha N(C) + A_{\\min}) - A_{\\min}}{(\\alpha N_0 + A_{\\min}) - A_{\\min}} = \\frac{\\alpha N(C)}{\\alpha N_0} = \\frac{N(C)}{N_0} $$\nTherefore, the baseline-corrected activity directly reflects the fraction of intact DNA, and our theoretical model is:\n$$ A'_{corr}(C) = \\exp(-kC) $$\n\n**Parameter Estimation**\nWe use the provided data to estimate the parameter $k$. First, we must calculate $A'_{corr}(C)$ for each data point using the given $A_{\\min}=0.05$ and $A_{\\max}=1.00$:\n$$ A'_{corr}(C) = \\frac{A(C) - 0.05}{1.00 - 0.05} = \\frac{A(C) - 0.05}{0.95} $$\n- For $C=1$: $A'_{corr}(1) = \\frac{0.687 - 0.05}{0.95} = \\frac{0.637}{0.95} \\approx 0.67053$\n- For $C=2$: $A'_{corr}(2) = \\frac{0.477 - 0.05}{0.95} = \\frac{0.427}{0.95} \\approx 0.44947$\n- For $C=3$: $A'_{corr}(3) = \\frac{0.336 - 0.05}{0.95} = \\frac{0.286}{0.95} \\approx 0.30105$\n- For $C=4$: $A'_{corr}(4) = \\frac{0.242 - 0.05}{0.95} = \\frac{0.192}{0.95} \\approx 0.20211$\n\nTo find $k$, we linearize the model by taking the natural logarithm:\n$$ \\ln(A'_{corr}(C)) = -kC $$\nThis equation is of the form $y = mx$, where $y = \\ln(A'_{corr}(C))$, $x=C$, and the slope is $m=-k$.
