I will address each part in sequence, adhering to strict logical and mathematical formalism.\n\nFirst, we establish the probabilistic framework. The parents are both heterozygous carriers, so the parental cross is $A a \\times A a$. According to Mendel's law of segregation, each parent produces two types of gametes, $A$ and $a$, with equal probability $p = \\frac{1}{2}$. Assuming random union of gametes, the probabilities of the offspring genotypes are given by the expansion of the binomial $(\\frac{1}{2}A + \\frac{1}{2}a)^2$:\n$$P(AA) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n$$P(Aa) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$P(aa) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nThe disorder is autosomal recessive with complete penetrance, meaning an individual is affected if and only if their genotype is $aa$. Let $C_i$ be the event that the $i$-th child is affected, and $U_i$ be the event that the $i$-th child is unaffected. The probabilities for any given child are:\n$$P(C_i) = P(aa) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n$$P(U_i) = P(AA) + P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\nNote that $P(C_i) + P(U_i) = 1$, as it must be.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the conditional probability that the third child is affected given that the first two children are unaffected. This is denoted as $P(C_3 | U_1 \\cap U_2)$. By the fundamental definition of conditional probability, we have:\n$$P(C_3 | U_1 \\cap U_2) = \\frac{P(C_3 \\cap U_1 \\cap U_2)}{P(U_1 \\cap U_2)}$$\nA critical premise of the problem is that \"meioses and fertilizations for different offspring are independent across conceptions.\" This implies that the health status of each child is a statistically independent event. For a set of independent events, the probability of their joint occurrence is the product of their individual probabilities. Therefore:\n$$P(C_3 \\cap U_1 \\cap U_2) = P(C_3) \\times P(U_1) \\times P(U_2)$$\nAnd for the conditioning event:\n$$P(U_1 \\cap U_2) = P(U_1) \\times P(U_2)$$\nSubstituting these into the conditional probability formula yields:\n$$P(C_3 | U_1 \\cap U_2) = \\frac{P(C_3) \\times P(U_1) \\times P(U_2)}{P(U_1) \\times P(U_2)}$$\nSince $P(U_1) = \\frac{3}{4} > 0$ and $P(U_2) = \\frac{3}{4} > 0$, the terms in the denominator are non-zero, and we can cancel them, which leads to:\n$$P(C_3 | U_1 \\cap U_2) = P(C_3) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nThe reason this conditional probability is identical to the marginal probability is a direct and necessary consequence of the independence of successive births. The mathematical definition of independence between two events $A$ and $B$ is $P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B)$, which implies $P(A|B) = P(A)$. In this genetic context, the biological process for each conception is a stochastic event whose outcome probabilities ($P(C_i) = \\frac{1}{4}$) are determined solely by the fixed genotypes of the parents and are not influenced by the outcomes of previous conceptions. Therefore, knowing that the first two children are unaffected provides no new information to update the probability for the third child. Each birth is an independent trial.\n\nNext, we perform the goodness-of-fit test. The null hypothesis ($H_0$) is that the probability of the third child being affected in the specified families follows the Mendelian model, i.e., $p_{A} = \\frac{1}{4}$. Consequently, the probability of being unaffected is $p_{U} = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\nThe study includes a cohort of $N = 320$ families that meet the condition (first two children are unaffected). The expected counts for the two possible outcomes for the third child are:\nExpected affected: $E_{A} = N \\times p_{A} = 320 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 80$\nExpected unaffected: $E_{U} = N \\times p_{U} = 320 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 240$\nThe observed counts are given as:\nObserved affected: $O_{A} = 68$\nObserved unaffected: $O_{U} = 252$\nThe Pearson's chi-square statistic ($\\chi^2$) is calculated using the formula:\n$$\\chi^2 = \\sum_{i} \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$$\nFor the two categories, this becomes:\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{(O_{A} - E_{A})^2}{E_{A}} + \\frac{(O_{U} - E_{U})^2}{E_{U}}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{(68 - 80)^2}{80} + \\frac{(252 - 240)^2}{240}$$\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{(-12)^2}{80} + \\frac{(12)^2}{240}$$\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{144}{80} + \\frac{144}{240}$$\nPerforming the arithmetic:\n$$\\chi^2 = 1.8 + 0.6 = 2.4$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.

This procedure relies on an asymptotic approximation that is valid only when expected cell counts are sufficiently large. A common guideline (Cochran's rule) requires that at least $80\\%$ of cells have an expected count of $5$ or more, and all cells must have an expected count of $1$ or more.\n\nIn our $2 \\times 3$ table, we have six cells. The expected counts are $\\{929.66, 8.46, 1.88, 59.34, 0.54, 0.12\\}$. Three cells ($50\\%$) have expected counts less than $5$, with two of them ($E(a, B_2)$ and $E(a, b_3)$) being less than $1$.

Apply the standard Pearson chi-square test with a continuity correction directly to the $2 \\times 3$ table; asymptotics are valid because $N$ is large, even if several expected counts are near $0$ or below $1$.\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The validity of the chi-square approximation depends on the expected counts in the cells, not merely the total sample size $N$. A large $N$ does not salvage the approximation if marginal probabilities are extreme, leading to small expected counts. As calculated, multiple expected counts are far below conventional thresholds. A continuity correction (like Yates' correction) is defined for $2 \\times 2$ tables and does not adequately address the failure of the asymptotic theory in larger, sparser tables. Claiming that the test is valid because $N$ is large is a gross oversimplification and is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nB. Pool $B_2$ and $b_3$ into a single “rare-$B$” category to form a $2 \\times 2$ table and then use Pearson’s chi-square only if, after pooling, all expected counts meet conventional thresholds (for example, at least $5$ in at least $80\\%$ of cells and none below $1$); otherwise, switch to an exact test.\nThis is a statistically sound and pragmatic strategy. Pooling categories is a common method to handle sparsity, provided it is biologically meaningful (e.g., pooling rare alleles). Let's form the $2 \\times 2$ table:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc|c}\n & B_1 & B_{rare} (B_2+b_3) & \\text{Row Total} \\\\\n\\hline\nA & 930 & 10 & 940 \\\\\na & 59 & 1 & 60 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Col Total} & 989 & 11 & 1000\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe new expected counts are:\n$E(A, B_1) = 929.66$, $E(A, B_{rare}) = \\frac{940 \\times 11}{1000} = 10.34$, $E(a, B_1) = 59.34$, $E(a, B_{rare}) = \\frac{60 \\times 11}{1000} = 0.66$.\nThe expected count $E(a, B_{rare}) = 0.66$ is still less than $1$. Thus, even after pooling, the condition for a chi-square test is not met. The strategy correctly prescribes to \"switch to an exact test\" in this scenario (e.g., Fisher's exact test on the $2 \\times 2$ table). This conditional approach ensures that a valid test is used, making the overall strategy appropriate for maintaining type I error control.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nC. Fit a multinomial model for the $2 \\times 3$ table with a symmetric Dirichlet prior of concentration parameter $\\alpha > 0$ on cell probabilities to obtain stabilized expected counts (equivalently, add $\\alpha$ pseudo-counts to each cell), form a test statistic (for example, a Pearson or likelihood-ratio statistic), and obtain its $p$-value by a permutation test that conditions on the observed margins.\nThis describes an advanced but valid and powerful method. Adding pseudo-counts derived from a prior is a Bayesian technique to regularize estimates, moving them away from zero. The crucial part of this strategy is the use of a permutation test to obtain the $p$-value. A permutation test generates the null distribution of the test statistic empirically by repeatedly shuffling the data labels (alleles at one locus relative to the other) while keeping the marginal totals fixed. This procedure does not rely on any asymptotic distributional assumptions (like the $\\chi^2$ distribution) and provides a valid test of independence regardless of the sparsity of the data. This composite strategy is statistically rigorous.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nD. Add $0.5$ to each observed cell (Haldane–Anscombe correction) to eliminate zeros and then interpret the resulting Pearson chi-square against the usual chi-square null distribution with the original degrees of freedom; this restores the nominal type I error even with many zero or very small expected cells.\nThis strategy is incorrect. While adding $0.5$ (or other small constants) to cells is a technique used in some contexts to stabilize variance or estimate log-odds, it is not a valid method for \"fixing\" the Pearson chi-square test. Modifying the observed counts $O_{ij}$ to $O'_{ij} = O_{ij} + 0.5$ and applying the standard test $\\sum (O'_{ij} - E'_{ij})^2 / E'_{ij}$ does not result in a statistic that follows the standard $\\chi^2$ distribution under the null hypothesis, especially when the original sparse-data problem exists. The claim that this simple adjustment \"restores the nominal type I error\" is false; it does not correct the fundamental invalidity of the asymptotic approximation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nE. Discard all haplotypes that carry $B_2$ or $b_3$ to avoid sparse cells and test LD using only the $(A,a) \\times B_1$ subset with the standard chi-square test.\nThis strategy is scientifically inappropriate and methodologically invalid. It involves selectively discarding data, which introduces severe bias. By removing all haplotypes with $B_2$ or $b_3$, the analysis is restricted to a sub-population where Locus B is monomorphic (only allele $B_1$ exists). It is impossible to test for an association with a variable that does not vary. The analysis is no longer about LD between Locus A and Locus B. This approach changes the scientific question and leads to meaningless results. It is a violation of sound scientific practice.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nF. Use Fisher’s exact test for independence on the original $2 \\times 3$ table (or a Monte Carlo exact procedure) to obtain a valid $p$-value that does not rely on large-sample approximations.\nThis is the classic and most direct correct approach for this problem. Fisher's exact test is specifically designed for contingency tables, particularly when expected cell frequencies are small. It calculates the exact probability of observing the given table, or one more extreme, under the null hypothesis of independence, conditional on the marginal totals. The underlying distribution for the cell counts, given the margins, is the multivariate hypergeometric distribution. For tables larger than $2 \\times 2$, direct computation can be demanding, so a Monte Carlo simulation (randomly generating tables with the same margins) is often used to estimate the exact $p$-value. This method provides a valid $p$-value without any reliance on asymptotic theory and is the standard solution for sparse tables.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nIn summary, the appropriate strategies are those that do not depend on the violated asymptotic assumptions of the Pearson chi-square test. These include using an exact test, employing a permutation test, or carefully pooling categories with a fallback to an exact test.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BCF}$$", "id": "2841815"}]}
