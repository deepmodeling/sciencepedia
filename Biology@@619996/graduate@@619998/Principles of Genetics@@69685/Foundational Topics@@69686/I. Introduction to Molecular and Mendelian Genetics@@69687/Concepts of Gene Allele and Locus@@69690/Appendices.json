This classical genetic tool allows us to determine if two recessive mutations causing a similar phenotype are located within the same gene (alleles) or in different genes. This exercise challenges you to interpret a set of complementation and deletion mapping data to group mutants into allelic series, thereby revealing the number of loci involved and tackling the insightful complication of intragenic complementation [@problem_id:2801410].", "problem": "You are given a set of $8$ independently isolated haploid mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, denoted $m_1$ through $m_8$, each exhibiting inability to grow without exogenous adenine (adenine auxotrophy). All mutations are recessive and map to nuclear loci. Pairwise complementation tests were performed by making diploids of all mutant pairs and scoring growth on adenine-free medium. A growth result is recorded as $+$ (complementation to adenine prototrophy) or $-$ (no complementation, adenine auxotrophy persists). In addition, each mutant was crossed to diploids heterozygous for one of three defined chromosomal deletions that each precisely removes a single known adenine-pathway gene: $D_A$ (deletes locus $A$), $D_B$ (deletes locus $B$), or $D_C$ (deletes locus $C$). For a mutant crossed to a strain carrying $D_X$ (where $X \\in \\{A,B,C\\}$), a result of $-$ indicates failure to complement the deletion, consistent with allelism to the deleted locus.\n\nThe following observations were made:\n\n- Pairwise mutant-by-mutant tests that showed $-$ (failure to complement) were exactly the following pairs: $(m_1,m_2)$, $(m_1,m_5)$, $(m_2,m_5)$, $(m_3,m_7)$, $(m_4,m_8)$, $(m_6,m_8)$. All other mutant-by-mutant combinations showed $+$.\n- Crosses to deletions yielded:\n  - With $D_A$: $-$ for $m_1$, $m_2$, $m_5$; $+$ for $m_3$, $m_4$, $m_6$, $m_7$, $m_8$.\n  - With $D_B$: $-$ for $m_3$, $m_7$; $+$ for $m_1$, $m_2$, $m_4$, $m_5$, $m_6$, $m_8$.\n  - With $D_C$: $-$ for $m_4$, $m_6$, $m_8$; $+$ for $m_1$, $m_2$, $m_3$, $m_5$, $m_7$.\n\nAssume all diploids are otherwise euploid and that the deletions act as null alleles for their respective genes. Based only on fundamental definitions of gene, allele, and locus, and the logic of complementation in diploids, infer the number of distinct loci represented among $m_1$ through $m_8$ and assign the mutants to complementation groups (allelic series). Your assignment must account for the observation that $(m_4,m_6)$ yields $+$ in the pairwise test even though both $m_4$ and $m_6$ fail to complement $m_8$ and $D_C$.\n\nChoose the option that correctly states both the number of loci and the grouping:\n\nA. There are $3$ loci.

The analysis will be based on the principles of the complementation test and deletion mapping.\n\nFirst, we must validate the problem statement.\nThe problem provides a set of $8$ recessive adenine-auxotrophic haploid mutants of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, $m_1$ through $m_8$. It supplies data from two types of experiments: pairwise complementation tests and deletion mapping against three known loci, $A$, $B$, and $C$.\nThe givens are:\n1.  Pairwise crosses yielding non-complementation (result $-$) are precisely: $(m_1,m_2)$, $(m_1,m_5)$, $(m_2,m_5)$, $(m_3,m_7)$, $(m_4,m_8)$, $(m_6,m_8)$. All other pairs complement (result $+$).\n2.  Tests against deletion $D_A$ (deletes locus $A$) yield $-$ for mutants $m_1, m_2, m_5$.\n3.  Tests against deletion $D_B$ (deletes locus $B$) yield $-$ for mutants $m_3, m_7$.\n4.  Tests against deletion $D_C$ (deletes locus $C$) yield $-$ for mutants $m_4, m_6, m_8$.\nThe problem also highlights the observation that the cross $(m_4, m_6)$ results in complementation ($+$).\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, utilizing standard procedures and concepts in classical genetics such as complementation, allelism, and deletion mapping. The phenomenon of intragenic (interallelic) complementation, which is suggested by the data for $m_4$ and $m_6$, is a well-established concept. The provided data is internally consistent and sufficient to derive a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe principle of the complementation test states that if two recessive mutations are alleles of the same gene, they will fail to complement each other when combined in a diploid organism, resulting in a mutant phenotype (result $-$). If the mutations are in different genes, they will complement each other, resulting in a wild-type phenotype (result $+$).\n\n**Step 1: Establishment of Complementation Groups from Pairwise Tests**\nWe organize the mutants into complementation groups based on non-complementation ($-$) data.\n- **Group 1**: Mutants $m_1$, $m_2$, and $m_5$ are mutually non-complementary ($(m_1,m_2)$, $(m_1,m_5)$, and $(m_2,m_5)$ all give $-$ results). They form a single complementation group: $\\{m_1, m_2, m_5\\}$. These are alleles of a single locus.\n- **Group 2**: Mutants $m_3$ and $m_7$ fail to complement each other ($(m_3, m_7)$ gives a $-$ result). They form a second complementation group: $\\{m_3, m_7\\}$. These are alleles of another locus.\n- **Group 3**: Mutant $m_4$ fails to complement $m_8$. Mutant $m_6$ also fails to complement $m_8$. This links $m_4$, $m_6$, and $m_8$. However, the cross $(m_4, m_6)$ yields a $+$ result. This is a classic case of intragenic complementation. Because both $m_4$ and $m_6$ fail to complement a common third allele ($m_8$), they are assigned to the same complementation group, representing a single locus. The complementation between them is an exception to the general rule, often seen with proteins that form homomultimers. Thus, the third group is $\\{m_4, m_6, m_8\\}$.\n\nFrom the pairwise tests, we infer the existence of $3$ distinct loci.\n\n**Step 2: Confirmation and Locus Assignment using Deletion Mapping**\nDeletion mapping provides an unambiguous test for allelism. A mutation located within a gene will fail to complement a deletion of that gene.\n- The mutants $m_1$, $m_2$, and $m_5$ are the only ones that fail to complement the deletion $D_A$. This definitively assigns the complementation group $\\{m_1, m_2, m_5\\}$ to locus $A$.\n- The mutants $m_3$ and $m_7$ are the only ones that fail to complement the deletion $D_B$. This assigns the group $\\{m_3, m_7\\}$ to locus $B$.\n- The mutants $m_4$, $m_6$, and $m_8$ are the only ones that fail to complement the deletion $D_C$. This assigns the group $\\{m_4, m_6, m_8\\}$ to locus $C$. This result confirms that $m_4$ and $m_6$ are indeed alleles of locus $C$, and their complementation is intragenic.\n\n**Summary of Conclusions**\n- There are $3$ distinct loci involved: $A$, $B$, and $C$.\n- The allelic assignments are:\n  - Locus $A$: $\\{m_1, m_2, m_5\\}$\n  - Locus $B$: $\\{m_3, m_7\\}$\n  - Locus $C$: $\\{m_4, m_6, m_8\\}$\n- The complementation between $m_4$ and $m_6$ is an instance of intragenic complementation within locus $C$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. There are $3$ loci. Mutants $m_1$, $m_2$, $m_5$ are alleles of locus $A$; mutants $m_3$, $m_7$ are alleles of locus $B$; mutants $m_4$, $m_6$, $m_8$ are alleles of locus $C$, with intragenic complementation between $m_4$ and $m_6$.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with the conclusions derived from a rigorous analysis of both the pairwise complementation data and the deletion mapping data. It correctly identifies the number of loci, the allelic groups, and the nature of the relationship between $m_4$ and $m_6$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. There are $4$ loci. Mutants $m_1$, $m_2$ define locus $A$; mutants $m_3$, $m_7$ define locus $B$; mutants $m_4$, $m_8$ define locus $C$; mutant $m_6$ defines a separate locus $D$ because it complements $m_4$.**\nThis option incorrectly interprets intragenic complementation. If $m_6$ were in a separate locus, it would complement the deletion $D_C$. The data shows it fails to complement $D_C$. Furthermore, it mis-assigns $m_5$, failing to group it with $m_1$ and $m_2$ in locus $A$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. There are $2$ loci. Mutants $m_1$, $m_2$, $m_5$, $m_4$, $m_6$, $m_8$ are alleles of one locus; mutants $m_3$, $m_7$ are alleles of the second locus.**\nThis option incorrectly merges loci $A$ and $C$. The data show that mutants from group $\\{m_1, m_2, m_5\\}$ complement mutants from group $\\{m_4, m_6, m_8\\}$. The deletion mapping also clearly distinguishes between locus $A$ and locus $C$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. There are $3$ loci. Mutants $m_1$, $m_2$ are alleles of locus $A$; mutants $m_3$, $m_7$ are alleles of locus $B$; mutants $m_4$, $m_6$, $m_8$ are alleles of locus $C$; mutant $m_5$ defines a separate locus $D$ because it fails to complement $m_1$ and $m_2$ but complements $D_A$.**\nThis option contains a factual error in its reasoning. It claims that $m_5$ \"complements $D_A$\". The problem statement explicitly gives the result of the cross between $m_5$ and the $D_A$ strain as $-$ (failure to complement). Therefore, the premise of the argument is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2801410"}, {"introduction": "Once genes are defined as distinct functional units, the next step is to understand their physical organization on chromosomes. The three-point testcross is a cornerstone of classical genetics, allowing us to simultaneously determine the order of and distance between three linked loci.

The problem is scientifically grounded in established principles of transmission genetics, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is stated objectively. It requires a standard, multi-step logical deduction, and is therefore not trivial or flawed. The problem is valid.\n\nWe proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of progeny, $N$.\n$$N = 677 + 677 + 203 + 203 + 103 + 103 + 17 + 17 = 2(677 + 203 + 103 + 17) = 2(1000) = 2000$$\n\nNext, we identify the parental (non-crossover, NCO) and double-crossover (DCO) genotypes. The parental classes are the most frequent, and the double-crossover classes are the least frequent.\n- NCO (Parental): $ABC$ ($677$) and $abc$ ($677$). These correspond to the gametes produced by the heterozygous parent without any crossing over. This establishes that the parental chromosomes carried the alleles in the arrangement $A\\ B\\ C$ and $a\\ b\\ c$.\n- DCO (Double Crossover): $AbC$ ($17$) and $aBc$ ($17$). These correspond to gametes resulting from simultaneous crossovers in the two regions between the three genes.\n\nThe gene order is determined by comparing the parental and DCO genotypes. A double crossover event results in the exchange of the middle allele between the two homologous chromosomes.\nLet us compare a parental chromosome, $A-B-C$, with a DCO gamete, $a-B-c$. This comparison is incorrect. We must compare one parental chromosome (e.g., $A\\ B\\ C$) with one non-reciprocal DCO gamete (e.g., $A\\ b\\ C$). The allele that is \"switched\" relative to its flanking markers is the one in the middle.\n- Parental: $A B C$\n- DCO: $A b C$\nComparing these, the alleles $A$ and $C$ are retained in their parental configuration, while the allele for the middle locus, $B$, has been exchanged for $b$. Therefore, the gene order is $A-B-C$.\n\nNow, we must identify the single-crossover (SCO) events for the two adjacent intervals, which we now know are $A-B$ and $B-C$.\n- SCO for interval $A-B$: These events produce gametes that are recombinant for loci $A$ and $B$ but parental for $B$ and $C$. These gametes are $Abc$ and $aBC$. The counts are $203$ and $203$, respectively.\n- SCO for interval $B-C$: These events produce gametes that are recombinant for loci $B$ and $C$ but parental for $A$ and $B$. These gametes are $ABc$ and $abC$. The counts are $103$ and $103$, respectively.\n\nWe can now calculate the recombination frequency ($R$) for each interval. The map distance in centimorgans (cM) is defined as $100 \\times R$. Recombinant progeny for a given interval include both the single crossovers in that interval and all double crossovers.\n\nRecombination frequency for interval $A-B$, $R_{A-B}$:\n$$R_{A-B} = \\frac{(\\text{Number of SCO}_{A-B}) + (\\text{Number of DCO})}{N} = \\frac{(203 + 203) + (17 + 17)}{2000} = \\frac{406 + 34}{2000} = \\frac{440}{2000} = 0.22$$\nThe map distance is $d_{A-B} = 100 \\times R_{A-B} = 22 \\text{ cM}$.\n\nRecombination frequency for interval $B-C$, $R_{B-C}$:\n$$R_{B-C} = \\frac{(\\text{Number of SCO}_{B-C}) + (\\text{Number of DCO})}{N} = \\frac{(103 + 103) + (17 + 17)}{2000} = \\frac{206 + 34}{2000} = \\frac{240}{2000} = 0.12$$\nThe map distance is $d_{B-C} = 100 \\times R_{B-C} = 12 \\text{ cM}$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the interference, $I$. Interference quantifies the degree to which a crossover in one interval affects the probability of a crossover in an adjacent interval. It is calculated as $I = 1 - C.C.$, where $C.C.$ is the coefficient of coincidence.\n\nThe coefficient of coincidence is the ratio of the observed frequency of double crossovers to the expected frequency of double crossovers.\n$$C.C. = \\frac{\\text{Observed DCO frequency}}{\\text{Expected DCO frequency}}$$\n\nThe observed frequency of DCOs is:\n$$\\text{Observed DCO frequency} = \\frac{\\text{Number of DCO}}{N} = \\frac{34}{2000} = 0.017$$\n\nThe expected frequency of DCOs, assuming independence of crossovers in the two intervals, is the product of the individual recombination frequencies for each interval:\n$$\\text{Expected DCO frequency} = R_{A-B} \\times R_{B-C} = 0.22 \\times 0.12 = 0.0264$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the coefficient of coincidence:\n$$C.C. = \\frac{0.017}{0.0264} \\approx 0.643939...$$\n\nAnd from this, the interference:\n$$I = 1 - C.C. = 1 - \\frac{0.017}{0.0264} = 1 - 0.643939... = 0.356060...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$I \\approx 0.3561$$\nThis positive value for interference indicates that a crossover in one region ($A-B$) reduces the likelihood of a simultaneous crossover in the adjacent region ($B-C$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3561}$$", "id": "2801387"}, {"introduction": "Moving from classical genetics to modern genomics, we can now investigate the functional consequences of allelic variation with quantitative precision.

A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe objective is to perform a two-sided exact binomial test to determine if the observed allelic ratio in RNA significantly deviates from the ratio observed in DNA.\n\nFirst, we establish the null hypothesis, $H_0$. Under $H_0$, there is no allelic imbalance, meaning the true proportion of the alternate allele in the expressed RNA population is the same as its proportion in the DNA. We estimate this null proportion, $p_0$, from the provided DNA read counts.\nTotal DNA reads = $200 (\\text{reference}) + 200 (\\text{alternate}) = 400$.\nThe number of alternate allele reads in DNA is $200$.\nTherefore, the null proportion of the alternate allele is:\n$$\np_0 = \\frac{200}{200 + 200} = \\frac{200}{400} = 0.5\n$$\n\nNext, we define the parameters for the binomial test based on the RNA data. The total number of RNA reads, $n$, is the sample size.\n$$\nn = 5 (\\text{reference}) + 15 (\\text{alternate}) = 20\n$$\nThe observed number of alternate-allele reads in the RNA sample is $x_{\\text{obs}} = 15$.\n\nUnder the null hypothesis, the number of alternate-allele reads, $X$, follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n=20$ and $p_0=0.5$. We write this as $X \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(20, 0.5)$. The probability mass function (PMF) is given by:\n$$\n\\Pr(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p_0^k (1-p_0)^{n-k} = \\binom{20}{k} (0.5)^k (0.5)^{20-k} = \\binom{20}{k} (0.5)^{20}\n$$\n\nThe two-sided $p$-value is defined as the probability of observing a result at least as extreme as the actual observation. The extremeness is measured by the deviation from the expected value under the null hypothesis. The expected number of alternate reads is:\n$$\nE[X] = n p_0 = 20 \\times 0.5 = 10\n$$\nThe observed deviation from the expected value is:\n$$\n|x_{\\text{obs}} - n p_0| = |15 - 10| = 5\n$$\nThe $p$-value is the sum of probabilities of all outcomes $k$ (where $k \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 20\\}$) for which the deviation $|k - n p_0|$ is greater than or equal to the observed deviation:\n$$\np\\text{-value} = \\Pr(|X - 10| \\ge 5)\n$$\nThis inequality, $|k-10| \\ge 5$, corresponds to two conditions:\n1. $k - 10 \\ge 5 \\implies k \\ge 15$.
