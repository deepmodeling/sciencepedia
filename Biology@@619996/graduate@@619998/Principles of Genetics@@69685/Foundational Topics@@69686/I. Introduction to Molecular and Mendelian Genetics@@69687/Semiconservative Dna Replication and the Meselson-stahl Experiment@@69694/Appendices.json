A synchronous culture of Escherichia coli (E. coli) is grown for many generations in medium containing heavy nitrogen, such that all chromosomal Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) duplexes are uniformly heavy–heavy. At time zero, the culture is shifted to light nitrogen medium and allowed to undergo exactly $2$ complete rounds of DNA replication and cell division. Assume the following fundamental basis:\n- Semiconservative replication: each daughter duplex inherits exactly one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand.\n- Equal DNA mass per cell: each cell contains the same genome mass $M$, independent of isotopic composition.\n- Population doubling per generation: the number of cells doubles with each completed replication–division cycle, and replication across the population is synchronous.\n- In cesium chloride (CsCl) buoyant density ultracentrifugation, band intensity is directly proportional to the total DNA mass at that buoyant density.\n\nLet “HL” denote hybrid duplexes containing one heavy strand and one light strand, and “LL” denote light–light duplexes.

The problem is well-posed, with a clear initial state, a defined process, and a quantifiable objective. It is free from ambiguity, contradiction, and factual error.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A rigorous solution can be formulated.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nLet $N_0$ be the initial number of cells at time $t=0$. Due to prolonged growth in the heavy medium, the DNA in every cell is of the heavy-heavy ($HH$) type. Let us denote the total initial mass of DNA as $M_{total}$. All this mass corresponds to $HH$ duplexes.\n\n**Generation 0 (Initial State):**\nAt $t=0$, before the first replication in the light medium, the entire population of DNA duplexes consists of the $HH$ type.\n- Fraction of $HH$ duplexes: $1$.\n- Fraction of hybrid ($HL$) duplexes: $0$.\n- Fraction of light-light ($LL$) duplexes: $0$.\n\n**Generation 1 (After 1 round of replication):**\nThe cells are now in a light ($^{14}$N) medium. According to the principle of semiconservative replication, each $HH$ duplex unwinds, and its two heavy strands serve as templates for the synthesis of new complementary strands. Since the precursors available are light, each heavy template strand ($H$) is paired with a newly synthesized light strand ($L$).\nThus, each initial $HH$ duplex gives rise to two hybrid ($HL$) duplexes.\n$$HH \\xrightarrow{\\text{1st replication in }^{14}\\text{N}} HL + HL$$\nAfter one generation, the number of cells doubles to $2N_0$, and the total DNA mass doubles. Every single DNA duplex in the population is now of the $HL$ type.\n- Fraction of $HH$ duplexes: $0$.\n- Fraction of $HL$ duplexes: $1$.\n- Fraction of $LL$ duplexes: $0$.\nThe CsCl gradient at this stage would show a single band at the hybrid density position.\n\n**Generation 2 (After 2 rounds of replication):**\nThe cells from Generation $1$, each containing only $HL$ DNA, undergo a second round of replication in the same light medium. Each $HL$ duplex unwinds into one heavy ($H$) strand and one light ($L$) strand. Each of these strands serves as a template.\n- The heavy template strand ($H$) pairs with a new light strand ($L$), forming one $HL$ duplex.\n- The light template strand ($L$) pairs with a new light strand ($L$), forming one $LL$ duplex.\nTherefore, each $HL$ duplex from Generation $1$ gives rise to one $HL$ duplex and one $LL$ duplex.\n$$HL \\xrightarrow{\\text{2nd replication in }^{14}\\text{N}} HL + LL$$\nSince the entire DNA population at the start of the second replication was of the $HL$ type, exactly half of the resulting DNA duplexes will be of the $HL$ type, and the other half will be of the $LL$ type. The total number of cells is now $4N_0$, and the total DNA mass has quadrupled relative to the start.\n- Fraction of $HL$ duplexes: $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Fraction of $LL$ duplexes: $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Fraction of $HH$ duplexes: $0$.\n\n**Calculation of Relative Intensities:**\nThe problem states that band intensity is directly proportional to the total DNA mass at that buoyant density. We have established that after $2$ generations, the total DNA mass is equally distributed between the hybrid ($HL$) and light-light ($LL$) forms.\nLet $I_{HL}$ be the intensity of the hybrid band and $I_{LL}$ be the intensity of the light-light band. The total intensity, $I_{total}$, is normalized to $1$.\n$$I_{total} = I_{HL} + I_{LL} = 1$$\nThe relative intensity of a band is equal to the fraction of the total DNA mass it represents.\nThe fraction of total DNA mass that is $HL$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe fraction of total DNA mass that is $LL$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nTherefore, the relative intensities are:\n$$I_{HL} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$I_{LL} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe expected relative intensities of the $HL$ and $LL$ bands are $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{2}$, respectively.

The means $\\mu_{\\mathrm{HL}}$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{LL}}$, and the shared standard deviation $\\sigma > 0$, are known constants.

This structure motivates the use of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm**\n\nThe EM algorithm simplifies this problem by introducing latent indicator variables. For each observation $x_i$, let $Z_i$ be a binary latent variable such that $Z_i=1$ if $x_i$ was generated from the HL component, and $Z_i=0$ if it was from the LL component. The set of all such variables is $\\mathbf{Z} = \\{Z_1, \\dots, Z_N\\}$.\nThe probability of $Z_i$ is governed by $\\theta$: $P(Z_i=1 \\mid \\theta) = \\theta$ and $P(Z_i=0 \\mid \\theta) = 1-\\theta$.\n\nThe complete-data log-likelihood, which includes the latent variables, is $\\ell_c(\\theta \\mid \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{Z}) = \\log p(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{Z} \\mid \\theta)$.

The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{HL}}^{(t)}}{\\theta} = \\frac{N - N_{\\mathrm{HL}}^{(t)}}{1-\\theta} \\implies N_{\\mathrm{HL}}^{(t)}(1-\\theta) = \\theta(N - N_{\\mathrm{HL}}^{(t)}) \\implies N_{\\mathrm{HL}}^{(t)} = N\\theta\n$$\nSolving for $\\theta$ gives the M-step update rule:\n$$\n\\theta^{(t+1)} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\gamma_i^{(t)} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{HL}}^{(t)}}{N}\n$$\nThis update has an intuitive interpretation: the new estimate for the HL fraction is the average responsibility of the HL component over all data points.\n\n**Part 3: Implementation and Algorithmic Details**\n\nThe implementation proceeds by first simulating the data according to the problem specification for each test case. An initial estimate for the mixing proportion is set to $\\theta^{(0)} = 0.50$. The algorithm then iteratively applies the E-step and M-step. In the E-step, the responsibilities $\\gamma_i^{(t)}$ are calculated for all $N$ data points using the current estimate $\\theta^{(t)}$. For numerical stability, as specified, the value of $\\theta^{(t)}$ used in the ratio is constrained to the interval $(10^{-12}, 1-10^{-12})$. In the M-step, the next estimate $\\theta^{(t+1)}$ is computed by averaging these responsibilities. The iteration continues until the absolute difference $|\\theta^{(t+1)} - \\theta^{(t)}|$ falls below a tolerance of $10^{-8}$ or a maximum of $10000$ iterations is reached. The final converged value is the maximum likelihood estimate $\\hat{\\theta}$.
