In the protein-rich medium, hormone $H$ binds reversibly to albumin ($A$) and SHBG ($S$). The equilibria are described by the law of mass action:\n$$H + A \\rightleftharpoons HA, \\quad K_{d}^{H\\text{-}A} = \\frac{[H]_{\\mathrm{free}}[A]_{\\mathrm{free}}}{[HA]}$$\n$$H + S \\rightleftharpoons HS, \\quad K_{d}^{H\\text{-}S} = \\frac{[H]_{\\mathrm{free}}[S]_{\\mathrm{free}}}{[HS]}$$\nwhere $[HA]$ and $[HS]$ are the concentrations of the hormone-protein complexes, and $[H]_{\\mathrm{free}}$, $[A]_{\\mathrm{free}}$, and $[S]_{\\mathrm{free}}$ are the concentrations of the free species.\n\nThe total concentration of the hormone, $[H]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, is the sum of the free and bound forms:\n$$[H]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [H]_{\\mathrm{free}} + [HA] + [HS]$$\nFrom the equilibrium expressions, we can express the concentrations of the bound forms in terms of the free hormone concentration:\n$$[HA] = \\frac{[H]_{\\mathrm{free}}[A]_{\\mathrm{free}}}{K_{d}^{H\\text{-}A}}$$\n$$[HS] = \\frac{[H]_{\\mathrm{free}}[S]_{\\mathrm{free}}}{K_{d}^{H\\text{-}S}}$$\nSubstituting these into the mass balance equation for the hormone:\n$$[H]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [H]_{\\mathrm{free}} + \\frac{[H]_{\\mathrm{free}}[A]_{\\mathrm{free}}}{K_{d}^{H\\text{-}A}} + \\frac{[H]_{\\mathrm{free}}[S]_{\\mathrm{free}}}{K_{d}^{H\\text{-}S}}$$\nFactoring out $[H]_{\\mathrm{free}}$:\n$$[H]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [H]_{\\mathrm{free}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{[A]_{\\mathrm{free}}}{K_{d}^{H\\text{-}A}} + \\frac{[S]_{\\mathrm{free}}}{K_{d}^{H\\text{-}S}} \\right)$$\nThe problem states that the binding proteins are in large molar excess. We verify this: $[E]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 0.001\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$ and $[C]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$ are both much smaller than $[A]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 600\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$. While $[C]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is larger than $[S]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, the binding affinity is extremely weak ($K_{d}^{C\\text{-}S} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$), meaning a negligible fraction of SHBG will be bound to cortisol. Thus, we can make the simplifying approximation that the free protein concentrations are equal to their total concentrations: $[A]_{\\mathrm{free}} \\approx [A]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ and $[S]_{\\mathrm{free}} \\approx [S]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$$[H]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [H]_{\\mathrm{free}}^{\\mathrm{protein\\text{-}rich}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{[A]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{d}^{H\\text{-}A}} + \\frac{[S]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{d}^{H\\text{-}S}} \\right)$$\nThe ratio of free hormone in the protein-rich medium to the total hormone concentration is therefore:\n$$\\frac{[H]_{\\mathrm{free}}^{\\mathrm{protein\\text{-}rich}}}{[H]_{\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\left( 1 + \\frac{[A]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{d}^{H\\text{-}A}} + \\frac{[S]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{d}^{H\\text{-}S}} \\right)^{-1}$$\nNext, we evaluate the quantity $\\phi_{H}$.

The rate is $v_{0,H}^{\\mathrm{protein\\text{-}free}} = k[H]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\nIn the protein-rich medium, the rate is $v_{0,H}^{\\mathrm{protein\\text{-}rich}} = k[H]_{\\mathrm{free}}^{\\mathrm{protein\\text{-}rich}}$.\nThus, the ratio $\\phi_{H}$ simplifies to:\n$$\\phi_{H} = \\frac{k[H]_{\\mathrm{free}}^{\\mathrm{protein\\text{-}rich}}}{k[H]_{\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{[H]_{\\mathrm{free}}^{\\mathrm{protein\\text{-}rich}}}{[H]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$$\nThis demonstrates that $\\phi_H$ is precisely the fraction of free hormone in the protein-rich medium.\n$$\\phi_{H} = \\left( 1 + \\frac{[A]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{d}^{H\\text{-}A}} + \\frac{[S]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{d}^{H\\text{-}S}} \\right)^{-1}$$\nNow we calculate $\\phi_{E}$ for estradiol and $\\phi_{C}$ for cortisol using the provided data.\nFor estradiol ($E$):\n$$ \\phi_{E} = \\left( 1 + \\frac{600\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}}{10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}} + \\frac{0.03\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}}{0.0005\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}} \\right)^{-1} $$\n$$ \\phi_{E} = \\left( 1 + 60 + \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{-4}} \\right)^{-1} = (1 + 60 + 60)^{-1} = (121)^{-1} $$\nFor cortisol ($C$):\n$$ \\phi_{C} = \\left( 1 + \\frac{600\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}}{150\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}} + \\frac{0.03\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}}{1000\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}} \\right)^{-1} $$\n$$ \\phi_{C} = (1 + 4 + 0.00003)^{-1} = (5.00003)^{-1} $$\nFinally, we compute the double ratio $\\rho$:\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{\\phi_{E}}{\\phi_{C}} = \\frac{(121)^{-1}}{(5.00003)^{-1}} = \\frac{5.00003}{121} $$\nPerforming the division:\n$$ \\rho \\approx 0.04132256... $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we obtain $\\rho = 0.04132$.\nThis result quantifies that the protein-rich environment suppresses the free concentration, and therefore the initial receptor engagement rate, of estradiol much more severely than that of cortisol, primarily due to estradiol's high affinity for SHBG.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.04132}\n$$", "id": "2575892"}, {"introduction": "Once a hormone enters the cell and binds its intracellular receptor, the complex must often travel to the nucleus to exert its effects on gene expression.

According to the law of mass action for competitive binding at equilibrium, the fractions of the receptor population that are unliganded ($P_0$), E2-bound ($P_E$), and SERM-bound ($P_S$) are determined by the free ligand concentrations and their respective dissociation constants.\nLet the common denominator for these probabilities be $Z_L$.\n$$ Z_L = 1 + \\frac{[E]}{K_{d,E}} + \\frac{[S]}{K_{d,S}} $$\nThe probabilities are then:\n$$ P_0 = \\frac{1}{Z_L}, \\quad P_E = \\frac{[E]/K_{d,E}}{Z_L}, \\quad P_S = \\frac{[S]/K_{d,S}}{Z_L} $$\nUsing the provided values:\n- Free E2 concentration: $[E] = 1.0$\n- Free SERM concentration: $[S] = 10.0$\n- Dissociation constants: $K_{d,E} = 0.20$, $K_{d,S} = 5.0$\n(All concentrations and dissociation constants are in $\\mathrm{nM}$, making the ratios dimensionless.)\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless ratios:\n$$ \\frac{[E]}{K_{d,E}} = \\frac{1.0}{0.20} = 5.0 $$\n$$ \\frac{[S]}{K_{d,S}} = \\frac{10.0}{5.0} = 2.0 $$\nThen, we calculate $Z_L$:\n$$ Z_L = 1 + 5.0 + 2.0 = 8.0 $$\nThe probabilities of the three ligand macrostates are:\n$$ P_0 = \\frac{1}{8.0} = 0.125 $$\n$$ P_E = \\frac{5.0}{8.0} = 0.625 $$\n$$ P_S = \\frac{2.0}{8.0} = 0.250 $$\nThe sum of these probabilities is $0.125 + 0.625 + 0.250 = 1.0$, as required.\n\n**Step 2: Calculation of Conditional Cofactor State Probabilities ($P_{M|X}$)**\n\nFor each ligand state $X$, the coactivator $A$ and corepressor $C$ compete for a single cofactor binding site. The site may also remain unoccupied ($N$). The conditional probabilities $P_{N|X}, P_{A|X}, P_{C|X}$ are determined by the free cofactor concentrations and the state-dependent dissociation constants.\nFor a generic ligand state $X$, let the denominator be $Z_{C|X}$:\n$$ Z_{C|X} = 1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_{A}^{X}} + \\frac{[C]}{K_{C}^{X}} $$\nThe conditional probabilities are:\n$$ P_{N|X} = \\frac{1}{Z_{C|X}}, \\quad P_{A|X} = \\frac{[A]/K_{A}^{X}}{Z_{C|X}}, \\quad P_{C|X} = \\frac{[C]/K_{C}^{X}}{Z_{C|X}} $$\nGiven cofactor concentrations: $[A] = 100$, $[C] = 200$.\n\nCase 1: Unliganded receptor ($X=0$)\nDissociation constants: $K_{A}^{0} = 500$, $K_{C}^{0} = 50$.\n$$ Z_{C|0} = 1 + \\frac{100}{500} + \\frac{200}{50} = 1 + 0.2 + 4.0 = 5.2 $$\n$P_{N|0} = \\frac{1}{5.2}$, $P_{A|0} = \\frac{0.2}{5.2}$, $P_{C|0} = \\frac{4.0}{5.2}$.\n\nCase 2: E2-bound receptor ($X=E$)\nDissociation constants: $K_{A}^{E} = 20$, $K_{C}^{E} = 100$.\n$$ Z_{C|E} = 1 + \\frac{100}{20} + \\frac{200}{100} = 1 + 5.0 + 2.0 = 8.0 $$\n$P_{N|E} = \\frac{1}{8.0}$, $P_{A|E} = \\frac{5.0}{8.0}$, $P_{C|E} = \\frac{2.0}{8.0}$.\n\nCase 3: SERM-bound receptor ($X=S$)\nDissociation constants: $K_{A}^{S} = 200$, $K_{C}^{S} = 20$.\n$$ Z_{C|S} = 1 + \\frac{100}{200} + \\frac{200}{20} = 1 + 0.5 + 10.0 = 11.5 $$\n$P_{N|S} = \\frac{1}{11.5}$, $P_{A|S} = \\frac{0.5}{11.5}$, $P_{C|S} = \\frac{10.0}{11.5}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculation of Average Efficacy per Ligand State ($\\langle\\varepsilon\\rangle_X$)**\n\nThe average efficacy for each ligand state is the weighted average of the microstate efficacies for that state.\n$$ \\langle\\varepsilon\\rangle_X = P_{N|X} \\cdot \\varepsilon_{X,N} + P_{A|X} \\cdot \\varepsilon_{X,A} + P_{C|X} \\cdot \\varepsilon_{X,C} $$\n\nFor $X=0$: $\\varepsilon_{0,N}=0.0, \\varepsilon_{0,A}=0.0, \\varepsilon_{0,C}=-0.4$.\n$$ \\langle\\varepsilon\\rangle_0 = \\frac{1}{5.2}(0.0) + \\frac{0.2}{5.2}(0.0) + \\frac{4.0}{5.2}(-0.4) = \\frac{-1.6}{5.2} = -\\frac{4}{13} $$\n\nFor $X=E$: $\\varepsilon_{E,N}=+0.2, \\varepsilon_{E,A}=+1.0, \\varepsilon_{E,C}=-0.2$.\n$$ \\langle\\varepsilon\\rangle_E = \\frac{1}{8.0}(0.2) + \\frac{5.0}{8.0}(1.0) + \\frac{2.0}{8.0}(-0.2) = \\frac{0.2 + 5.0 - 0.4}{8.0} = \\frac{4.8}{8.0} = 0.6 $$\n\nFor $X=S$: $\\varepsilon_{S,N}=0.0, \\varepsilon_{S,A}=+0.2, \\varepsilon_{S,C}=-0.6$.\n$$ \\langle\\varepsilon\\rangle_S = \\frac{1}{11.5}(0.0) + \\frac{0.5}{11.5}(0.2) + \\frac{10.0}{11.5}(-0.6) = \\frac{0.1 - 6.0}{11.5} = \\frac{-5.9}{11.5} = -\\frac{59}{115} $$\n\n**Step 4: Calculation of Total Expected Efficacy ($\\langle\\varepsilon\\rangle$)**\n\nFinally, the total expected efficacy is computed by summing the contributions from each ligand state, weighted by their probabilities.\n$$ \\langle\\varepsilon\\rangle = P_0 \\cdot \\langle\\varepsilon\\rangle_0 + P_E \\cdot \\langle\\varepsilon\\rangle_E + P_S \\cdot \\langle\\varepsilon\\rangle_S $$\nSubstituting the previously calculated values:\n$$ \\langle\\varepsilon\\rangle = (0.125) \\left(-\\frac{4}{13}\\right) + (0.625) (0.6) + (0.250) \\left(-\\frac{59}{115}\\right) $$\n$$ \\langle\\varepsilon\\rangle = \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{4}{13}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{5}{8}\\right) \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{59}{115}\\right) $$\n$$ \\langle\\varepsilon\\rangle = -\\frac{1}{26} + \\frac{3}{8} - \\frac{59}{460} $$\nTo obtain a numerical result, we convert the fractions to decimals:\n$$ \\langle\\varepsilon\\rangle \\approx -0.0384615 + 0.375 - 0.1282609 $$\n$$ \\langle\\varepsilon\\rangle \\approx 0.2082776 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\langle\\varepsilon\\rangle \\approx 0.2083 $$\nThis final value represents the net transcriptional output of the receptor population, integrating the effects of an agonist, a modulator, and basal activity under the specified physiological conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2083}$$", "id": "2575925"}]}
