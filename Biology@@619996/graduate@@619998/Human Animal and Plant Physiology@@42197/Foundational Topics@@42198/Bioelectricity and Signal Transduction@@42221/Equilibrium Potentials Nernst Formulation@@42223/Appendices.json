For a channel permeable to $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ and $\\mathrm{K}^+$, the total current is the sum of the individual ionic currents:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{net}} = I_{\\mathrm{Na}} + I_{\\mathrm{K}}$$\nAt the reversal potential, $I_{\\mathrm{net}} = 0$, which implies:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{Na}} = -I_{\\mathrm{K}}$$\nThis condition signifies that the inward electrical current carried by $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ ions is exactly balanced by the outward electrical current carried by $\\mathrm{K}^+$ ions. It does *not* imply that each individual current is zero. The potential at which a single ionic current vanishes is its Nernst equilibrium potential, $E_{\\mathrm{ion}}$.\n\nThe Nernst potential for an ion of valence $z$ is given by:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{ion}} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{a_{\\mathrm{ion,o}}}{a_{\\mathrm{ion,i}}}\\right)$$\nwhere $R$ is the gas constant ($8.314\\ \\mathrm{J}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$), $T$ is the absolute temperature ($310\\ \\mathrm{K}$), $F$ is the Faraday constant ($96485\\ \\mathrm{C}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$), and $a$ represents ionic activity. For this problem, the pre-factor $\\frac{RT}{F}$ is:\n$$\\frac{RT}{F} = \\frac{(8.314\\ \\mathrm{J}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{K}^{-1})(310\\ \\mathrm{K})}{96485\\ \\mathrm{C}\\cdot\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}} \\approx 0.0267\\ \\mathrm{V} = 26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}$$\nFor monovalent cations ($\\mathrm{Na}^+$, $\\mathrm{K}^+$), $z=1$. The individual Nernst potentials are:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{K}} = (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{a_{\\mathrm{K},o}}{a_{\\mathrm{K},i}}\\right) = (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{5}{140}\\right) \\approx (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV})(-3.332) \\approx -89.0\\ \\mathrm{mV}$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{Na}} = (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{a_{\\mathrm{Na},o}}{a_{\\mathrm{Na},i}}\\right) = (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{145}{12}\\right) \\approx (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV})(2.492) \\approx +66.5\\ \\mathrm{mV}$$\nSince $E_{\\mathrm{K}} \\neq E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, it is impossible for both $I_{\\mathrm{K}}$ and $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ to be zero simultaneously. Therefore, the reversal potential $V_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ must lie at a value intermediate between $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$. Its precise value is determined by the relative permeabilities of the ions, as described by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) voltage equation.\n\nFor a system with $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ and $\\mathrm{K}^+$, the GHK equation is:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{rev}} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{K}} a_{\\mathrm{K},o} + P_{\\mathrm{Na}} a_{\\mathrm{Na},o}}{P_{\\mathrm{K}} a_{\\mathrm{K},i} + P_{\\mathrm{Na}} a_{\\mathrm{Na},i}} \\right)$$\nGiven the permeability ratio $P_{\\mathrm{K}}:P_{\\mathrm{Na}} = 3:1$, we can set $P_{\\mathrm{K}} = 3$ and $P_{\\mathrm{Na}} = 1$ in relative units.\n\n**Initial Condition Calculation:**\nUsing the initial activities:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{rev,initial}} = (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln \\left( \\frac{(3)(5) + (1)(145)}{(3)(140) + (1)(12)} \\right)$$\n$$V_{\\mathrm{rev,initial}} = (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln \\left( \\frac{15 + 145}{420 + 12} \\right) = (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln \\left( \\frac{160}{432} \\right)$$\n$$V_{\\mathrm{rev,initial}} \\approx (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln(0.3704) \\approx (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV})(-0.993) \\approx -26.5\\ \\mathrm{mV}$$\nThis calculated value is very close to the experimentally observed value of approximately $-25\\ \\mathrm{mV}$, confirming the validity of the GHK model for this system.\n\n**Prediction of Change:**\nNow, let $a_{\\mathrm{K},o}$ be increased to $15\\ \\mathrm{mM}$.\nQualitatively, increasing the external potassium activity makes the potassium gradient less steep, which makes the Nernst potential for potassium, $E_K$, less negative (depolarizes it). Since the channel is highly permeable to $\\mathrm{K}^+$, this will shift the overall reversal potential $V_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ in the positive (depolarizing) direction.\n\n**New Condition Calculation:**\n$$V_{\\mathrm{rev,new}} = (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln \\left( \\frac{(3)(15) + (1)(145)}{(3)(140) + (1)(12)} \\right)$$\n$$V_{\\mathrm{rev,new}} = (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln \\left( \\frac{45 + 145}{420 + 12} \\right) = (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln \\left( \\frac{190}{432} \\right)$$\n$$V_{\\mathrm{rev,new}} \\approx (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln(0.4398) \\approx (26.7\\ \\mathrm{mV})(-0.821) \\approx -21.9\\ \\mathrm{mV}$$\nThe reversal potential shifts from about $-26.5\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ to about $-21.9\\ \\mathrm{mV}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The zero-current voltage is set by the condition that the permeability-weighted ionic fluxes of $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ and $\\mathrm{K}^+$ carry equal and opposite charge so that the net current is zero. Because both ions permeate, the reversal potential lies between the individual equilibria and depends on the relative permeabilities and activities, not on either single-ion equilibrium alone.

The zero-current condition requires that the inward $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ current balances the outward $\\mathrm{K}^+$ current. The reversal potential is therefore a weighted average of the Nernst potentials, dependent on permeabilities and activities.\n- The quantitative predictions are accurate. My calculation yields an initial potential of $-26.5\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ (approximated as $-26\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ in the option) and a new potential of $-21.9\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ (approximated as $-22\\ \\mathrm{mV}$). These numbers align perfectly.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The zero-current voltage equals the unweighted arithmetic mean of the two single-ion equilibrium potentials, $E_{\\mathrm{rev}} = \\left(E_{\\mathrm{K}} + E_{\\mathrm{Na}}\\right)/2$, independent of relative permeability or activities; it is therefore near $-10\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ and does not change when $a_{\\mathrm{K},o}$ is increased.**\n- This statement is fundamentally flawed. The reversal potential is a *weighted* average, where the weighting depends on permeability and concentrations (or conductance in the chord conductance model). An unweighted mean is incorrect.\n- Calculation based on their faulty premise: $(E_{\\mathrm{K}} + E_{\\mathrm{Na}})/2 \\approx (-89.0 + 66.5)/2 = -11.25\\ \\mathrm{mV}$. The value \"near $-10\\ \\mathrm{mV}$\" is consistent with this incorrect formula, but the formula itself is wrong.\n- The claim that it \"does not change when $a_{\\mathrm{K},o}$ is increased\" is also false. A change in $a_{\\mathrm{K},o}$ alters $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$, which would change even this incorrect arithmetic mean.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The zero-current voltage coincides with a gating transition that minimizes conductance; because gating kinetics determine the voltage of minimal current, the reversal potential is unrelated to ionic activities or permeabilities and will not change when $a_{\\mathrm{K},o}$ is increased.**\n- This confuses the reversal potential with other channel properties like voltage-dependent gating or block. The reversal potential is the voltage of zero current, not necessarily minimal conductance. The problem states the I-V curve is \"nearly linear\", which weighs against complex gating phenomena defining the zero-current point.\n- The assertion that $V_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ is unrelated to ionic activities or permeabilities is a gross violation of the fundamental principles of electrodiffusion.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The zero-current voltage is constrained by bulk electroneutrality to remain near $0\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ regardless of channel selectivity; thus it is approximately $0\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ and remains near $0\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ even if $a_{\\mathrm{K},o}$ is tripled.**\n- This reflects a misunderstanding of electroneutrality. Bulk solutions are electroneutral, but this does not constrain the membrane potential—a phenomenon of charge separation across the thin membrane capacitance—to be zero. Significant membrane potentials are generated by the movement of an infinitesimal fraction of the total ions, which does not violate bulk electroneutrality.\n- The prediction of $V_{\\mathrm{rev}} \\approx 0\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ is contradicted by both the problem's observation ($-25\\ \\mathrm{mV}$) and the GHK calculation.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. At zero current, each ion must be individually at electrochemical equilibrium so that their individual fluxes vanish; therefore the reversal potential must simultaneously equal both $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, which is impossible with the given activities, implying that non-ideal solution effects dominate and the reversal potential remains undefined under these conditions.**\n- The premise that individual ionic fluxes must vanish is incorrect. Only the *net* flux must be zero. The condition $I_{\\mathrm{Na}} = -I_{\\mathrm{K}}$ explicitly requires non-zero individual currents (and fluxes).\n- While it is true that $V_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ cannot simultaneously equal both $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ (as $E_{\\mathrm{K}} \\neq E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$), the conclusion that the potential is \"undefined\" is false. The situation is well-defined and described by the GHK equation.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2566353"}]}
