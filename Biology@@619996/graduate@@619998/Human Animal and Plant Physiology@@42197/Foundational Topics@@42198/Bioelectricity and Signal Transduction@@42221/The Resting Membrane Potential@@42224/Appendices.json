It presents a standard, fundamental derivation in cellular electrophysiology. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core principle for determining the equilibrium potential for an ion across a selectively permeable membrane is that at equilibrium, there is no net flux of the ion. This condition is met when the electrochemical potential of the ion is equal on both sides of the membrane. The electrochemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}_j$, for an ionic species $j$ is the sum of its chemical potential, $\\mu_j$, and its electrical potential energy per mole:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_j = \\mu_j + z_j F \\psi $$\nHere, $z_j$ is the valence (charge number) of the ion, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $\\psi$ is the local electric potential.\n\nFor an ideal dilute solution, the chemical potential is given by:\n$$ \\mu_j = \\mu_j^{\\circ} + R T \\ln[j] $$\nwhere $\\mu_j^{\\circ}$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $[j]$ is the molar concentration (activity) of the ion.\n\nFor the system in question, which is at steady state and permeable only to potassium ions ($K^+$), the equilibrium condition is the equality of the electrochemical potential for potassium inside and outside the cell:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_{K, \\mathrm{in}} = \\tilde{\\mu}_{K, \\mathrm{out}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for electrochemical potential:\n$$ \\mu_{K, \\mathrm{in}} + z_K F \\psi_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\mu_{K, \\mathrm{out}} + z_K F \\psi_{\\mathrm{out}} $$\nHere, $\\psi_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and $\\psi_{\\mathrm{out}}$ are the electric potentials inside and outside the cell, respectively, and $z_K$ is the valence of the potassium ion, which is a monovalent cation, so $z_K = +1$.\n\nNext, we substitute the ideal-solution form of the chemical potential:\n$$ (\\mu_{K}^{\\circ} + R T \\ln [K^+]_{\\mathrm{in}}) + z_K F \\psi_{\\mathrm{in}} = (\\mu_{K}^{\\circ} + R T \\ln [K^+]_{\\mathrm{out}}) + z_K F \\psi_{\\mathrm{out}} $$\nThe standard chemical potential term, $\\mu_{K}^{\\circ}$, is identical on both sides and thus cancels.\n$$ R T \\ln [K^+]_{\\mathrm{in}} + z_K F \\psi_{\\mathrm{in}} = R T \\ln [K^+]_{\\mathrm{out}} + z_K F \\psi_{\\mathrm{out}} $$\nWe rearrange this equation to solve for the electric potential difference across the membrane, which is defined as the membrane potential, $V_m = \\psi_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\psi_{\\mathrm{out}}$.

Apply tetrodotoxin (TTX) first; then $\\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$; finally ouabain.**\n1.  **Apply TTX**: TTX blocks the voltage-gated sodium channels responsible for the persistent sodium leak current, $I_{Na}$. This removes a depolarizing influence on the neuron. The remaining currents are the hyperpolarizing $I_K$ and $I_p$. This results in a net hyperpolarizing current, which will cause $V_m$ to become more negative (hyperpolarize). The magnitude of this immediate hyperpolarization is a direct measure of the contribution of the TTX-sensitive $I_{Na}$ to the resting potential. The prediction \"TTX causes a small hyperpolarization\" is **Correct**.\n\n2.  **Apply $\\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$ (in the continued presence of TTX)**: After the initial change from TTX, $V_m$ will be more negative than $-70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ but still likely above $E_K$ since the potassium leak conductance is typically large. At any potential above $E_K$, the potassium current $I_K$ is a hyperpolarizing influence. $\\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$ blocks this potassium leak current. Removing this dominant hyperpolarizing current will cause the membrane potential to shift in the depolarizing direction. The extent of this depolarization quantifies the contribution of the $\\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$-sensitive potassium leak.

The remaining significant current is the pump current, $I_p$. As established, $I_p$ is a hyperpolarizing current. Blocking the pump with ouabain removes this hyperpolarizing influence, causing a depolarization. The magnitude of this fast depolarization directly reflects the electrogenic contribution of the pump. The prediction \"ouabain causes a small depolarization\" is **Correct**.\n\nThe sequence is logical: it peels away one component at a time, allowing for sequential quantification.

Apply ouabain first; then $\\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$; then TTX.**\n-   \"ouabain causes a hyperpolarization\": This is incorrect. Blocking the pump, a hyperpolarizing influence, causes depolarization.\n-   \"wait until $V_m$ re-stabilizes over several minutes\": This directly violates the problem's critical constraint to use only immediate changes to avoid confounds from shifting ionic gradients. Blocking the pump for minutes would cause significant changes in $[\\mathrm{Na}^+]_i$ and $[\\mathrm{K}^+]_i$, rendering subsequent measurements uninterpretable with respect to the initial state.\n-   \"$\\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$ causes a hyperpolarization\": Incorrect. Blocking the hyperpolarizing $I_K$ causes depolarization.\n-   \"TTX causes a depolarization\": Incorrect. Blocking the depolarizing $I_{Na}$ causes hyperpolarization.\nThis option is flawed in its experimental logic and contains multiple factually incorrect predictions. It is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Apply $\\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$ first; then TTX; then ouabain.**\n-   **Apply $\\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$ first**: This will block the dominant hyperpolarizing leak current, $I_K$, causing a large depolarization. This part of the prediction is correct.\n-   **Next, apply TTX**: The cell is now in a depolarized state. The sodium leak current $I_{Na}$ is still a depolarizing influence. Blocking it with TTX would remove this influence, causing a hyperpolarization. The option predicts a \"further depolarization,\" which is incorrect.\n-   **Finally, apply ouabain**: The option predicts a \"slow hyperpolarization\". Blocking the pump causes a fast depolarization, not a slow hyperpolarization.\nThis option contains multiple incorrect predictions. It is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Apply TTX and ouabain simultaneously; then apply $\\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$.**\nThe purpose of the experiment is to *separately* estimate the contributions of each component. This protocol applies TTX (blocking the depolarizing $I_{Na}$) and ouabain (blocking the hyperpolarizing $I_p$) at the same time. The resulting change in $V_m$ would be the net effect of removing two opposing currents, making it impossible to disentangle their individual contributions from this single step. This confounds the measurement and defeats the purpose of the experiment. The claim that this sequence is \"optimal\" is false; it is a poor design. It is **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a step-by-step analysis grounded in electrochemical principles, Option A is the only one that proposes a logically sound sequence of interventions and correctly predicts the direction of the resulting changes in membrane potential, while adhering to the methodological constraints required for a clean interpretation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2618522"}]}
