The definitions of the equilibrium and dissociation constants are standard.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary parameters ($L$, $K_R$, $K_{R^{\\ast}}$, $[I]$) to calculate a unique, physically meaningful quantity (the fold-change in signaling). The total receptor concentration is not needed, as it will cancel out in the calculation of a fractional quantity.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is precise and unbiased.\n- **Conclusion**: The problem is self-contained, scientifically sound, and logically consistent. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe solution requires the calculation of the fraction of receptors in the active state under two conditions: without ligand (basal activity) and with the inverse agonist $I$. The fold-change is the ratio of these two fractions.\n\n**1. Fraction of Active Receptors in the Absence of Ligand ($f_{\\text{active, basal}}$)**\nIn the absence of any ligand, the system consists only of the two receptor states, $R$ and $R^{\\ast}$. The total concentration of receptors, $R_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the concentrations of these two states:\n$$R_{\\text{total}} = [R] + [R^{\\ast}]$$\nThe active receptors are the ones in the $R^{\\ast}$ conformation. The fraction of active receptors is thus:\n$$f_{\\text{active, basal}} = \\frac{[R^{\\ast}]}{R_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[R^{\\ast}]}{[R] + [R^{\\ast}]}$$\nUsing the definition of the equilibrium constant $L = [R]/[R^{\\ast}]$, we can write $[R] = L[R^{\\ast}]$. Substituting this into the expression gives:\n$$f_{\\text{active, basal}} = \\frac{[R^{\\ast}]}{L[R^{\\ast}] + [R^{\\ast}]} = \\frac{[R^{\\ast}]}{[R^{\\ast}](L+1)} = \\frac{1}{L+1}$$\nGiven $L=9$, the basal fraction of active receptors is:\n$$f_{\\text{active, basal}} = \\frac{1}{9+1} = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1$$\n\n**2. Fraction of Active Receptors in the Presence of Inverse Agonist ($f_{\\text{active, I}}$)**\nIn the presence of the inverse agonist $I$, four receptor species exist in equilibrium: $R$, $R^{\\ast}$, $IR$, and $IR^{\\ast}$. The total receptor concentration is now:\n$$R_{\\text{total}} = [R] + [R^{\\ast}] + [IR] + [IR^{\\ast}]$$\nAccording to the problem statement, the active species are $R^{\\ast}$ and $IR^{\\ast}$. Therefore, the total concentration of active receptors is $[R^{\\ast}] + [IR^{\\ast}]$. The fraction of active receptors is:\n$$f_{\\text{active, I}} = \\frac{[R^{\\ast}] + [IR^{\\ast}]}{[R] + [R^{\\ast}] + [IR] + [IR^{\\ast}]}$$\nTo solve this, we must express all concentrations in terms of a single reference species, for which we choose $[R^{\\ast}]$. From the provided definitions:\n- From $L = [R]/[R^{\\ast}]$, we have $[R] = L[R^{\\ast}]$.\n- From $K_{R^{\\ast}} = [R^{\\ast}][I]/[IR^{\\ast}]$, we have $[IR^{\\ast}] = \\frac{[R^{\\ast}][I]}{K_{R^{\\ast}}}$.\n- From $K_{R} = [R][I]/[IR]$, and using $[R] = L[R^{\\ast}]$, we have $[IR] = \\frac{[R][I]}{K_{R}} = \\frac{L[R^{\\ast}][I]}{K_{R}}$.\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions into the formula for $f_{\\text{active, I}}$.\nThe numerator (active species) becomes:\n$$[R^{\\ast}] + [IR^{\\ast}] = [R^{\\ast}] + \\frac{[R^{\\ast}][I]}{K_{R^{\\ast}}} = [R^{\\ast}]\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{R^{\\ast}}}\\right)$$\nThe denominator (total species) becomes:\n$$[R] + [R^{\\ast}] + [IR] + [IR^{\\ast}] = L[R^{\\ast}] + [R^{\\ast}] + \\frac{L[R^{\\ast}][I]}{K_{R}} + \\frac{[R^{\\ast}][I]}{K_{R^{\\ast}}}$$\n$$= [R^{\\ast}]\\left(L + 1 + \\frac{L[I]}{K_{R}} + \\frac{[I]}{K_{R^{\\ast}}}\\right)$$\nThe fraction $f_{\\text{active, I}}$ is the ratio of the numerator to the denominator. The term $[R^{\\ast}]$ cancels:\n$$f_{\\text{active, I}} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{R^{\\ast}}}}{L + 1 + \\frac{L[I]}{K_{R}} + \\frac{[I]}{K_{R^{\\ast}}}}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $L=9$, $K_{R}=10$ nM, $K_{R^{\\ast}}=1000$ nM, and $[I]=100$ nM. The ratios of concentrations are dimensionless:\n$$\\frac{[I]}{K_{R}} = \\frac{100 \\text{ nM}}{10 \\text{ nM}} = 10$$\n$$\\frac{[I]}{K_{R^{\\ast}}} = \\frac{100 \\text{ nM}}{1000 \\text{ nM}} = 0.1$$\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $f_{\\text{active, I}}$:\n$$f_{\\text{active, I}} = \\frac{1 + 0.1}{9 + 1 + 9(10) + 0.1} = \\frac{1.1}{10 + 90 + 0.1} = \\frac{1.1}{100.1}$$\n\n**3. Fold-Change in Basal Signaling**\nThe fold-change is defined as the ratio of the active fraction in the presence of $I$ to the basal active fraction:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{f_{\\text{active, I}}}{f_{\\text{active, basal}}}$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{\\frac{1.1}{100.1}}{\\frac{1}{10}} = \\frac{1.1 \\times 10}{100.1} = \\frac{11}{100.1}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} \\approx 0.10989010989...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant figure is $9$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$\\text{Fold-change} \\approx 0.1099$$\nThis result is consistent with the definition of an inverse agonist, which stabilizes the inactive state of a constitutively active receptor, thereby reducing its basal signaling output.

It is based on the established operational model of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonism, provides a complete and consistent set of parameters, and requests a calculation that is formalizable and solvable within this framework. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution can be derived.\n\nThe relationship between the concentration of an agonist, $[A]$, and the biological response, $E$, within the operational model is given by the equation:\n$$ E([A]) = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{sys}} \\cdot \\tau \\cdot [A]}{K_A + (1+\\tau)[A]} $$\nwhere $E_{\\mathrm{sys}}$ is the maximal possible response of the system, $K_A$ is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the agonist, and $\\tau$ is the operational efficacy parameter. The parameter $\\tau$ is a dimensionless quantity that consolidates the intrinsic efficacy of the agonist and the density of functional receptors.\n\nFirst, we derive general expressions for the maximal response achievable by the agonist, $E_{\\max}$, and its half-maximal effective concentration, $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$.\n\nThe maximal response, $E_{\\max}$, is the asymptotic value of the response as the agonist concentration approaches infinity:\n$$ E_{\\max} = \\lim_{[A]\\to\\infty} \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{sys}} \\cdot \\tau \\cdot [A]}{K_A + (1+\\tau)[A]} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{sys}} \\cdot \\tau}{1+\\tau} $$\n\nThe half-maximal effective concentration, $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$, is the concentration of agonist that produces a response equal to $E_{\\max}/2$.

The parameter $\\tau$ is proportional to the total number of functional receptors, $[R_{tot}]$. If the initial number of receptors is $[R_{tot}]$, the new number is $[R_{tot}'] = (1-q)[R_{tot}]$. Consequently, the new operational efficacy parameter, $\\tau'$, is related to the original parameter $\\tau$ by:\n$$ \\tau' = (1-q)\\tau $$\nThe parameters $K_A$ and $E_{\\mathrm{sys}}$ are unaffected by the inactivation.

A receptor reserve (or spare receptors) exists when a maximal or near-maximal response can be elicited by an agonist at a concentration where not all receptors are occupied. In the context of the operational model, this is indicated by a significant separation between the agonist's binding affinity, $K_A$, and its functional potency, $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$. Specifically, a receptor reserve exists if $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}  K_A$. From our derivation, $\\mathrm{EC}_{50} = K_A / (1+\\tau)$. Thus, the condition $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}  K_A$ is satisfied for any system with $\\tau  0$.\n\nIn the control condition, we have $K_A = 10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and $\\tau = 9$. The control $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ is:\n$$ \\mathrm{EC}_{50} = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{1+9} = 1\\,\\mathrm{nM} $$\nSince $\\mathrm{EC}_{50} = 1\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ is substantially less than $K_A = 10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, this indicates that the system possesses a significant receptor reserve. The high value of $\\tau = 9$ acts as an amplification factor. The presence of this reserve is further evidenced by the effect of receptor inactivation. Despite inactivating $50\\%$ of the receptors, the maximal response only decreases from $E_{\\max} = \\frac{100 \\cdot 9}{10} = 90$ to $E_{\\max}' \\approx 81.82$, a reduction of only about $9\\%$. In a system without a reserve, a $50\\%$ loss of receptors would lead to a much more pronounced, if not proportional, decrease in the maximal response.

Note that $EC_{50}$ values are given in $\\mathrm{nM}$, so $\\frac{\\tau}{K_{A}}$ will have units of $\\mathrm{nM}^{-1}$.\n\n1.  **Reference ligand, Pathway G (Ref, G):**\n    $E_{\\max} = 80$, $E_{\\mathrm{m,G}} = 100$, $EC_{50} = 5~\\mathrm{nM}$\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{\\tau}{K_{A}}\\right)_{\\text{Ref,G}} = \\frac{80}{100 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{80}{500} = 0.16~\\mathrm{nM}^{-1} $$\n\n2.  **Test ligand, Pathway G (Test, G):**\n    $E_{\\max} = 60$, $E_{\\mathrm{m,G}} = 100$, $EC_{50} = 2~\\mathrm{nM}$\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{\\tau}{K_{A}}\\right)_{\\text{Test,G}} = \\frac{60}{100 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{60}{200} = 0.3~\\mathrm{nM}^{-1} $$\n\n3.  **Reference ligand, Pathway B (Ref, B):**\n    $E_{\\max} = 120$, $E_{\\mathrm{m,B}} = 200$, $EC_{50} = 10~\\mathrm{nM}$\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{\\tau}{K_{A}}\\right)_{\\text{Ref,B}} = \\frac{120}{200 \\cdot 10} = \\frac{120}{2000} = 0.06~\\mathrm{nM}^{-1} $$\n\n4.  **Test ligand, Pathway B (Test, B):**\n    $E_{\\max} = 90$, $E_{\\mathrm{m,B}} = 200$, $EC_{50} = 1~\\mathrm{nM}$\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{\\tau}{K_{A}}\\right)_{\\text{Test,B}} = \\frac{90}{200 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{90}{200} = 0.45~\\mathrm{nM}^{-1} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the bias metric $\\Delta\\Delta \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{K_{A}}\\right)$:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{K_{A}}\\right) \\equiv \\left[\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{K_{A}}\\right)_{\\text{Test,G}} - \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{K_{A}}\\right)_{\\text{Test,B}}\\right] - \\left[\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{K_{A}}\\right)_{\\text{Ref,G}} - \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{K_{A}}\\right)_{\\text{Ref,B}}\\right] $$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, the expression can be simplified before numerical evaluation:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{K_{A}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{(\\tau/K_{A})_{\\text{Test,G}}}{(\\tau/K_{A})_{\\text{Test,B}}}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{(\\tau/K_{A})_{\\text{Ref,G}}}{(\\tau/K_{A})_{\\text{Ref,B}}}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{K_{A}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.3}{0.45}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.16}{0.06}\\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{K_{A}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{16}{6}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{8}{3}\\right) $$\nUsing the property $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$ again:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{K_{A}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{2/3}{8/3}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{8}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = -\\ln(4) $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ -\\ln(4) \\approx -1.38629436... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
