The expression for the electrochemical potential in a compartment with electric potential $V$ and ion concentration $[j]$ is:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_j = \\mu_j^{\\circ} + RT \\ln[j] + z_j F V $$\nHere, $\\mu_j^{\\circ}$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $z_j$ is the valence of the ion, and $F$ is the Faraday constant.
