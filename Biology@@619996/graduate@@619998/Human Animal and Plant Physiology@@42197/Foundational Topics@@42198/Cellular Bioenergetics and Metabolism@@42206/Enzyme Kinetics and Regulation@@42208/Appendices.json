The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, so we may proceed with a formal solution.\n\nStep 1: Derivation of the Proportionality Constant\n\nThe canonical minimal mechanism for a single-substrate enzyme-catalyzed reaction is given by the following elementary steps, where $E$ is the enzyme, $S$ is the substrate, $ES$ is the enzyme-substrate complex, and $P$ is the product:\n$$\nE + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\stackrel{k_2}{\\longrightarrow} E + P\n$$\nHere, $k_1$, $k_{-1}$, and $k_2$ are the rate constants for substrate binding, substrate dissociation, and catalysis, respectively. The catalytic rate constant $k_2$ is more generally denoted as the turnover number, $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$. The initial velocity of the reaction, $v_0$, is the initial rate of product formation:\n$$\nv_0 = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [ES]\n$$\nTo find an expression for $[ES]$, we apply the steady-state approximation, which assumes that the concentration of the intermediate complex $[ES]$ remains constant over the initial phase of the reaction, i.e., $\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = 0$.\nThe rate of formation of $[ES]$ is $k_1 [E][S]$. The rate of breakdown of $[ES]$ is $(k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})[ES]$. At steady state:\n$$\nk_1 [E][S] = (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}) [ES]\n$$\nThe total enzyme concentration, $[E]_T$, is the sum of free enzyme $[E]$ and bound enzyme $[ES]$: $[E]_T = [E] + [ES]$, which implies $[E] = [E]_T - [ES]$. Substituting this into the steady-state equation gives:\n$$\nk_1 ([E]_T - [ES])[S] = (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}) [ES]\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $[ES]$:\n$$\nk_1 [E]_T [S] - k_1 [ES][S] = (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}) [ES]\n$$\n$$\nk_1 [E]_T [S] = [ES] (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}} + k_1 [S])\n$$\n$$\n[ES] = \\frac{k_1 [E]_T [S]}{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}} + k_1 [S]}\n$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $k_1$:\n$$\n[ES] = \\frac{[E]_T [S]}{\\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_1} + [S]}\n$$\nThe Michaelis constant, $K_m$, is defined as $K_m = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_1}$. Substituting $K_m$ yields the expression for the steady-state concentration of $[ES]$:\n$$\n[ES] = \\frac{[E]_T [S]}{K_m + [S]}\n$$\nNow, substitute this back into the rate equation $v_0 = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [ES]$:\n$$\nv_0 = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_T [S]}{K_m + [S]}\n$$\nThis is the Michaelis-Menten equation. The problem statement refers to the \"initial rate per active site\", which we interpret as $v_0 / [E]_T$. Let us denote this quantity by $v'$.\n$$\nv' = \\frac{v_0}{[E]_T} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [S]}{K_m + [S]}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the condition of low substrate concentration, where $[S] \\ll K_m$. Under this condition, the denominator of the rate equation can be approximated as $K_m + [S] \\approx K_m$. The rate equation simplifies to:\n$$\nv' \\approx \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [S]}{K_m} = \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_m}\\right) [S]\n$$\nThis equation shows that for $[S] \\ll K_m$, the rate per active site $v'$ is directly proportional to the substrate concentration $[S]$. The proportionality constant is therefore the ratio $\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_m}$. This ratio is known as the specificity constant or the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. It represents a second-order rate constant for the reaction between the enzyme and the substrate.\n\nStep 2: Computation for Enzyme A and Enzyme B\n\nWe are given the kinetic parameters for two enzymes, A and B. We will calculate the specificity constant for each, ensuring the units are converted to $\\mathrm{M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}$. The conversion for the Michaelis constant is $1\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} = 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M}$.\n\nFor Enzyme A:\n$k_{\\mathrm{cat, A}} = 100\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n$K_{m, A} = 50\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} = 50 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M}$\nThe specificity constant for Enzyme A is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_m}\\right)_A = \\frac{100\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}}{50 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M}} = 2.0 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}\n$$\n\nFor Enzyme B:\n$k_{\\mathrm{cat, B}} = 20\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n$K_{m, B} = 2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} = 2 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M}$\nThe specificity constant for Enzyme B is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_m}\\right)_B = \\frac{20\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}}{2 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M}} = 10 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}} = 1.0 \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}\n$$\n\nStep 3: Discussion of Diffusion Limit and Final Calculation\n\nThe problem states that the diffusion-controlled upper bound for the specificity constant is on the order of $10^8$ to $10^9\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}$. An enzyme with a $\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_m}$ value in this range is considered \"catalytically perfect,\" meaning its rate is limited only by how fast the substrate can diffuse to the active site.\n\nComparing our calculated values:\nEnzyme A: $\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_m}\\right)_A = 2.0 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}$\nEnzyme B: $\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_m}\\right)_B = 1.0 \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}$\n\nNeither enzyme has a specificity constant that reaches the diffusion-controlled limit of $10^8\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}$. Therefore, neither enzyme is diffusion-limited. Their overall catalytic rates are limited by chemical steps on the enzyme surface (e.g., conformational changes, bond breaking/formation, product release) rather than by substrate encounter frequency.\n\nTo determine which is closer to this limit, we compare their magnitudes. The value for Enzyme B, $1.0 \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}$, is one order of magnitude below the limit. The value for Enzyme A, $2.0 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}$, is closer to two orders of magnitude below the limit. Thus, Enzyme B is significantly more efficient than Enzyme A under substrate-scarce conditions and is closer to being a diffusion-limited enzyme.\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute the ratio $R$ of the larger constant to the smaller one.\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_m}\\right)_B}{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_m}\\right)_A} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}}{2.0 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}} = \\frac{10 \\times 10^6}{2 \\times 10^6} = 5\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as required, the dimensionless ratio $R$ is $5.00$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{5.00}\n$$", "id": "2565934"}, {"introduction": "Enzyme inhibition is a cornerstone of physiological regulation and drug design, and the half-maximal inhibitory concentration, $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$, is a universally measured parameter.

We must then calculate $K_i$ and analyze the breakdown of a common simplifying assumption.\n\nFirst, we formalize the kinetic scheme. The enzyme, $E$, binds substrate, $S$, to form the Michaelis complex, $ES$, which yields product. This is competitively inhibited by an inhibitor, $I$, which binds only to the free enzyme to form an inactive complex, $EI$.\nThe equilibria are:\n$$E + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\stackrel{k_{cat}}{\\longrightarrow} E + P$$\n$$E + I \\underset{k_{-i}}{\\stackrel{k_i}{\\rightleftharpoons}} EI$$\n\nThe relevant constants are the Michaelis constant, $K_m = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{cat}}{k_1}$, and the inhibitor dissociation constant, $K_i = \\frac{[E][I]}{[EI]}$.\n\nThe total enzyme concentration is conserved:\n$$[E]_t = [E] + [ES] + [EI]$$\nwhere $[E]$, $[ES]$, and $[EI]$ are the concentrations of free enzyme, enzyme-substrate complex, and enzyme-inhibitor complex, respectively.\n\nThe initial velocity of the reaction, $v_i$, is given by $v_i = k_{cat}[ES]$. The uninhibited velocity, $v_0$ (when $[I]=0$ and thus $[EI]=0$), is given by the standard Michaelis-Menten equation, $v_0 = \\frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m + [S]}$, where $V_{max} = k_{cat}[E]_t$. This expression for $v_0$ is derived from the steady-state condition on $[ES]$ and accounts for the partitioning of enzyme between $[E]$ and $[ES]$.\n\nA general expression for the inhibited velocity $v_i$ can be derived. The fraction of the total enzyme population that is not sequestered by the inhibitor is $([E]_t - [EI])/[E]_t$. Only this fraction is available to participate in the catalytic cycle with the substrate. Therefore, the velocity in the presence of the inhibitor, $v_i$, relates to the uninhibited velocity, $v_0$, as follows:\n$$v_i = v_0 \\left( \\frac{[E]_t - [EI]}{[E]_t} \\right) = v_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{[EI]}{[E]_t} \\right)$$\nThis relationship holds for any inhibitor that acts by withdrawing free enzyme from the system (i.e., does not bind to the $ES$ complex).\n\nThe problem defines the $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ as the total inhibitor concentration, $[I]_t$, at which the initial velocity is halved, i.e., $v_i = \\frac{1}{2} v_0$. Substituting this condition into the equation above:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} v_0 = v_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{[EI]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}}{[E]_t} \\right)$$\nwhere $[EI]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}$ is the concentration of the $EI$ complex when $[I]_t = \\mathrm{IC}_{50}$. Solving for $[EI]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}$ yields a crucial intermediate result:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = 1 - \\frac{[EI]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}}{[E]_t} \\implies \\frac{[EI]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}}{[E]_t} = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies [EI]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}} = \\frac{1}{2}[E]_t$$\nThis demonstrates that at $50\\%$ inhibition, exactly half of the total enzyme is sequestered in the $EI$ complex.\n\nNow, we must relate the total inhibitor concentration, $[I]_t$, to the free inhibitor concentration, $[I]$. The mass balance for the inhibitor is:\n$$[I]_t = [I] + [EI]$$\nAt the $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ condition, this becomes:\n$$\\mathrm{IC}_{50} = [I]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}} + [EI]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}$$\nwhere $[I]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}$ is the free inhibitor concentration at the $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ point. Substituting our result for $[EI]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}$:\n$$\\mathrm{IC}_{50} = [I]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}} + \\frac{1}{2}[E]_t$$\nThis equation links the experimental observable, $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$, to the thermodynamically significant free inhibitor concentration, $[I]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}$.\n\nThe next step is to find an expression for $[I]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}$. This is the free inhibitor concentration required to halve the reaction rate. The velocity equation for competitive inhibition as a function of free inhibitor concentration $[I]$ is:\n$$v_i = \\frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]}$$\nSetting $v_i = \\frac{1}{2}v_0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m + [S]}$ gives:\n$$\\frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}}{K_i}\\right) + [S]} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m + [S]}$$\n$$2(K_m + [S]) = K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}}{K_i}\\right) + [S]$$\n$$2K_m + 2[S] = K_m + \\frac{K_m[I]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}}{K_i} + [S]$$\n$$K_m + [S] = \\frac{K_m[I]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}}{K_i}$$\nSolving for $[I]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}$ yields the Cheng-Prusoff equation for a competitive inhibitor:\n$$[I]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}} = K_i \\frac{K_m + [S]}{K_m} = K_i \\left(1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_m}\\right)$$\nNow we substitute this expression for $[I]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}$ into our equation for $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$:\n$$\\mathrm{IC}_{50} = K_i \\left(1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_m}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}[E]_t$$\nThis is the required relationship, often known as the Morrison equation for a competitive inhibitor.

This value is of the same magnitude as $[E]_t = 10~\\mathrm{nM}$, confirming that this is indeed a case of tight-binding inhibition.\n\nFinally, we analyze the simplification in the limit of negligible enzyme concentration, $[E]_t \\to 0$.\nStarting from the derived expression:\n$$\\mathrm{IC}_{50} = K_i \\left(1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_m}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}[E]_t$$\nIf we assume $[E]_t$ is negligible, we set $[E]_t \\to 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\\mathrm{IC}_{50} \\approx K_i \\left(1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_m}\\right)$$\nThis is the commonly used Cheng-Prusoff equation, which approximates $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ (total inhibitor concentration) with what is rigorously an expression for the free inhibitor concentration required for $50\\%$ inhibition.\n\nThis simplification fails for tight-binding inhibitors precisely because the premise ($[E]_t$ is negligible) is violated. The underlying physical assumption of the simplification is that the amount of inhibitor bound to the enzyme, $[EI]$, is a negligible fraction of the total inhibitor concentration, $[I]_t$. That is, $[I] \\approx [I]_t$.\nA tight-binding inhibitor is defined as one for which $K_i$ is close to or smaller than $[E]_t$. Let us examine the full equation: $\\mathrm{IC}_{50} = [I]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}} + [EI]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}} = K_i(1 + [S]/K_m) + [E]_t/2$.\nFor a very tight binder ($K_i \\to 0$), the first term becomes very small, and the equation approaches its stoichiometric limit:\n$$\\mathrm{IC}_{50} \\to \\frac{1}{2}[E]_t$$\nThis means the measured $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ is determined not by the inhibitor's affinity ($K_i$) but by the concentration of the enzyme itself. To inhibit half the enzyme, one must add at least a stoichiometric amount of inhibitor equal to half the enzyme concentration.\nThe simplified Cheng-Prusoff equation, however, predicts $\\mathrm{IC}_{50} \\to 0$ as $K_i \\to 0$, which is physically incorrect. The failure occurs because for a tight binder, the condition $[EI]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}} \\ll \\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ is not met. In fact, since $[EI]_{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}} = [E]_t/2$ and $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ approaches $[E]_t/2$, the bound inhibitor can constitute nearly $100\\%$ of the total inhibitor at the $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ point.\nIn the given problem, $[E]_t/2 = 5~\\mathrm{nM}$ while $\\mathrm{IC}_{50} = 19~\\mathrm{nM}$. The term $[E]_t/2$ accounts for $5/19 \\approx 26.3\\%$ of the $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ value, which is not a negligible contribution. Using the simplified Cheng-Prusoff equation would yield $K_i \\approx \\frac{19~\\mathrm{nM}}{1.4} \\approx 13.6~\\mathrm{nM}$, an error of approximately $36\\%$ compared to the correct value of $10.0~\\mathrm{nM}$.

All concentrations are in units of micromolar ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) and time is in seconds ($\\mathrm{s}$).\n\nThe fundamental principles, as stated, are:\n1.  The rate of an elementary bimolecular reaction $A + B \\rightarrow C$ is given by $k[A][B]$, where $k$ is the second-order rate constant.\n2.  Mass is conserved within each stage: for each $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$, the total concentration $S_i$ is constant, such that $Z_i(t) + E_i(t) = S_i$. This allows expressing the zymogen concentration as $Z_i(t) = S_i - E_i(t)$.\n3.  Deactivation of each active enzyme $E_i$ is a first-order process with rate $k_{di}E_i$.\n\nWe now derive the ODE for each active enzyme $E_i(t)$. For notational simplicity, we denote concentrations $E_i(t)$ as $E_i$, $Z_i(t)$ as $Z_i$, and the external trigger concentration as $T$.\n\n**Stage 0: Active Enzyme $E_0$**\nThe rate of change of $E_0$ is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_0}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of formation of } E_0) - (\\text{Rate of deactivation of } E_0)\n$$\nThe formation of $E_0$ occurs through the activation of its zymogen, $Z_0$. This activation is catalyzed by two species: the external trigger $T$ and the terminal enzyme $E_2$ (positive feedback).\n- The reaction $Z_0 \\xrightarrow{T} E_0$ has a rate based on mass-action kinetics: $v_{0,T} = k_{0T} T Z_0$.\n- The reaction $Z_0 \\xrightarrow{E_2} E_0$ has a rate: $v_{\\mathrm{fb}} = k_{\\mathrm{fb}} E_2 Z_0$.\n\nThe total rate of formation of $E_0$ is the sum of these two rates:\n$$\nv_{\\text{form}, 0} = v_{0,T} + v_{\\mathrm{fb}} = (k_{0T} T + k_{\\mathrm{fb}} E_2) Z_0\n$$\nThe deactivation of $E_0$ is a first-order process:\n$$\nv_{\\text{deact}, 0} = k_{d0} E_0\n$$\nCombining these terms, the differential equation for $E_0$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_0}{dt} = (k_{0T} T + k_{\\mathrm{fb}} E_2) Z_0 - k_{d0} E_0\n$$\nUsing the mass conservation relation $Z_0 = S_0 - E_0$, we obtain the final form of the ODE for $E_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_0}{dt} = (k_{0T} T + k_{\\mathrm{fb}} E_2)(S_0 - E_0) - k_{d0} E_0\n$$\n\n**Stage 1: Active Enzyme $E_1$**\nThe rate of change of $E_1$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_1}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of formation of } E_1) - (\\text{Rate of deactivation of } E_1)\n$$\nThe formation of $E_1$ occurs through the activation of $Z_1$, catalyzed by $E_0$.\n- The reaction $Z_1 \\xrightarrow{E_0} E_1$ has a rate: $v_1 = k_1 E_0 Z_1$.\nThe deactivation of $E_1$ is a first-order process:\n$$\nv_{\\text{deact}, 1} = k_{d1} E_1\n$$\nCombining these terms, the differential equation for $E_1$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_1}{dt} = k_1 E_0 Z_1 - k_{d1} E_1\n$$\nUsing the mass conservation relation $Z_1 = S_1 - E_1$, we obtain the final form of the ODE for $E_1$:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_1}{dt} = k_1 E_0 (S_1 - E_1) - k_{d1} E_1\n$$\n\n**Stage 2: Active Enzyme $E_2$**\nThe rate of change of $E_2$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_2}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of formation of } E_2) - (\\text{Rate of deactivation of } E_2)\n$$\nThe formation of $E_2$ occurs through the activation of $Z_2$, catalyzed by $E_1$.\n- The reaction $Z_2 \\xrightarrow{E_1} E_2$ has a rate: $v_2 = k_2 E_1 Z_2$.\nThe deactivation of $E_2$ is a first-order process:\n$$\nv_{\\text{deact}, 2} = k_{d2} E_2\n$$\nCombining these terms, the differential equation for $E_2$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_2}{dt} = k_2 E_1 Z_2 - k_{d2} E_2\n$$\nUsing the mass conservation relation $Z_2 = S_2 - E_2$, we obtain the final form of the ODE for $E_2$:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_2}{dt} = k_2 E_1 (S_2 - E_2) - k_{d2} E_2\n$$\n\n**Summary of the Initial Value Problem**\nThe dynamics of the zymogen activation cascade are described by the following system of coupled, nonlinear ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{dE_0}{dt} = (k_{0T} T + k_{\\mathrm{fb}} E_2)(S_0 - E_0) - k_{d0} E_0 \\\\\n\\frac{dE_1}{dt} = k_1 E_0 (S_1 - E_1) - k_{d1} E_1 \\\\\n\\frac{dE_2}{dt} = k_2 E_1 (S_2 - E_2) - k_{d2} E_2\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe system is to be solved as an initial value problem over the time interval $t \\in [0, t_{\\mathrm{end}}]$, where $t_{\\mathrm{end}} = 2000\\,\\mathrm{s}$. The initial conditions are given as $E_i(0) = 0$ for all $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$, which corresponds to a state where all proteases are in their inactive zymogen form. The state vector is $\\mathbf{y}(t) = [E_0(t), E_1(t), E_2(t)]^T$, with initial state $\\mathbf{y}(0) = [0, 0, 0]^T$.\n\nThe parameters for the system are:\n- Total concentrations: $S_0 = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $S_1 = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $S_2 = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n- Activation rate constants: $k_{0T} = 0.02\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_1 = 1.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_2 = 1.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n- Deactivation rate constants: $k_{d0} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{d1} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{d2} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n- Variable parameters per test case: external trigger concentration $T$ (denoted $T_0$) and positive feedback rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{fb}}$.\n\nThe final output for each case is the dimensionless fraction $E_2(t_{\\mathrm{end}})/S_2$, numerically computed and rounded to three decimal places.
