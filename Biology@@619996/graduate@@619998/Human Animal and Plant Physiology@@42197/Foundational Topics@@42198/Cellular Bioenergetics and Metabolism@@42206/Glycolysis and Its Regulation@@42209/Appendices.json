It presents a standard problem in metabolic control analysis, based on fundamental principles of thermodynamics and enzyme kinetics. The provided data (concentrations, standard free energies, constants) are biochemically realistic and self-consistent. The problem asks for an explanation of an experimental observation and a prediction based on established theory, which is a valid scientific question. No violations of the validation criteria are found.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the relationship between the actual Gibbs free energy change ($\\Delta G'$) of a reaction under cellular conditions and its role in controlling metabolic flux. The equation for $\\Delta G'$ is:\n$$ \\Delta G' = \\Delta G'^{\\circ} + RT \\ln Q $$\nwhere $\\Delta G'^{\\circ}$ is the standard transformed Gibbs free energy change, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $Q$ is the mass-action ratio, which is the ratio of product concentrations to reactant concentrations, each raised to the power of its stoichiometric coefficient.\n\nA reaction is considered near-equilibrium if $\\Delta G' \\approx 0$. For such reactions, both forward and reverse reactions occur at high rates that are nearly equal. Increasing the enzyme concentration increases both rates proportionally, but the net flux ($J = v_f - v_r$) is not significantly altered because it is primarily determined by the mass-action ratio $Q$, which is held close to the equilibrium constant $K'_{eq}$ by the activities of upstream and downstream enzymes. Such enzymes have a low flux control coefficient.\n\nConversely, a reaction is far from equilibrium (or irreversible) if $\\Delta G'$ is large and negative. For these reactions, the reverse rate is negligible ($v_r \\approx 0$), so the net flux is simply the forward rate ($J \\approx v_f$). These reactions are potential control points for the pathway; increasing the enzyme's activity will directly increase the flux, all else being equal. These enzymes have high flux control coefficients.\n\nWe will calculate $\\Delta G'$ for the three reactions for which data is provided.\nThe value of $RT$ is:\n$$ RT = (8.314 \\text{ J mol}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1})(310 \\text{ K}) \\approx 2577 \\text{ J mol}^{-1} = 2.577 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1} $$\n\n**1. Phosphoglucose Isomerase (PGI) Reaction**\nThe reaction is G6P $\\rightleftharpoons$ F6P.\nThe mass-action ratio $Q_{PGI}$ is:\n$$ Q_{PGI} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{F6P}]}{[\\mathrm{G6P}]} = \\frac{0.10 \\text{ mM}}{0.20 \\text{ mM}} = 0.5 $$\nThe actual Gibbs free energy change $\\Delta G'_{PGI}$ is:\n$$ \\Delta G'_{PGI} = \\Delta G'^{\\circ}_{PGI} + RT \\ln Q_{PGI} $$\n$$ \\Delta G'_{PGI} = (+1.7 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}) + (2.577 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}) \\ln(0.5) $$\n$$ \\Delta G'_{PGI} = 1.7 + 2.577 \\times (-0.693) \\approx 1.7 - 1.786 = -0.086 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1} $$\nSince $\\Delta G'_{PGI} \\approx 0$, the PGI reaction is operating at near-equilibrium. This confirms that PGI has very little control over the glycolytic flux. Overexpressing it increases the enzyme's capacity, but since the reaction is already close to equilibrium, it only serves to quicken the equilibration between G6P and F6P without increasing the net flow through the pathway. The flux is instead \"pulled\" by downstream irreversible steps.\n\n**2. Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) Reaction**\nThe reaction is F6P $+$ ATP $\\to$ F1,6BP $+$ ADP.\nThe mass-action ratio $Q_{PFK-1}$ is:\n$$ Q_{PFK-1} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{F1,6BP}][\\mathrm{ADP}]}{[\\mathrm{F6P}][\\mathrm{ATP}]} = \\frac{(0.010 \\text{ mM})(0.50 \\text{ mM})}{(0.10 \\text{ mM})(5.0 \\text{ mM})} = \\frac{0.005}{0.50} = 0.01 $$\nThe actual Gibbs free energy change $\\Delta G'_{PFK-1}$ is:\n$$ \\Delta G'_{PFK-1} = \\Delta G'^{\\circ}_{PFK-1} + RT \\ln Q_{PFK-1} $$\n$$ \\Delta G'_{PFK-1} = (-14.2 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}) + (2.577 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}) \\ln(0.01) $$\n$$ \\Delta G'_{PFK-1} = -14.2 + 2.577 \\times (-4.605) \\approx -14.2 - 11.87 = -26.07 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1} $$\nThis large negative value for $\\Delta G'_{PFK-1}$ indicates that the reaction is far from equilibrium and effectively irreversible under these cellular conditions. Such steps are the primary candidates for flux control. Furthermore, the PFK-1 step is the first committed step of glycolysis, meaning its product, F1,6BP, has no major metabolic fate other than proceeding through glycolysis. This makes PFK-1 a critical point for pathway regulation.\n\n**3. Pyruvate Kinase (PK) Reaction**\nThe reaction is PEP $+$ ADP $\\to$ pyruvate $+$ ATP.\nThe mass-action ratio $Q_{PK}$ is:\n$$ Q_{PK} = \\frac{[\\text{pyruvate}][\\mathrm{ATP}]}{[\\mathrm{PEP}][\\mathrm{ADP}]} = \\frac{(0.10 \\text{ mM})(5.0 \\text{ mM})}{(0.050 \\text{ mM})(0.50 \\text{ mM})} = \\frac{0.50}{0.025} = 20 $$\nThe actual Gibbs free energy change $\\Delta G'_{PK}$ is:\n$$ \\Delta G'_{PK} = \\Delta G'^{\\circ}_{PK} + RT \\ln Q_{PK} $$\n$$ \\Delta G'_{PK} = (-31.7 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}) + (2.577 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}) \\ln(20) $$\n$$ \\Delta G'_{PK} = -31.7 + 2.577 \\times (2.996) \\approx -31.7 + 7.72 = -23.98 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1} $$\nThis large negative value for $\\Delta G'_{PK}$ also indicates that the PK reaction is far from equilibrium and a site of control.\n\n**Conclusion for Flux Control**\nBoth PFK-1 and PK are far-from-equilibrium reactions and thus are major control points. However, PFK-1 is generally considered the \"pacemaker\" of glycolysis. It is located at the entry to the committed part of the pathway and is subject to complex allosteric regulation, underscoring its primary role in controlling overall flux. Overexpressing PFK-1 would create a strong \"pull\" on its substrate F6P, thereby increasing the net flux through the entire pathway from glucose. While overexpressing PK would also increase flux, its effect might be less pronounced than that of PFK-1, which governs the committal of carbon to glycolysis. Therefore, PFK-1 is the best candidate for achieving the largest increase in flux.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. PGI operates at near-equilibrium with $\\Delta G' \\approx 0$, so increasing its capacity amplifies forward and reverse rates similarly and the net flux is set by upstream and downstream driving forces; thus overexpressing PFK-1, which operates far from equilibrium and commits flux into glycolysis, will produce the largest flux increase.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with our analysis. Our calculation shows $\\Delta G'_{PGI} \\approx -0.09$ kJ mol$^{-1}$, which is near equilibrium ($\\approx 0$). The explanation for its low flux control is correct. Our calculation for PFK-1 shows $\\Delta G'_{PFK-1} \\approx -26.1$ kJ mol$^{-1}$, which is far from equilibrium. PFK-1's role as the committed, flux-controlling step is accurately described.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. PGI failed to increase flux because its Michaelis constant for fructose-6-phosphate is too low to respond to higher expression; overexpressing aldolase, which has the most positive $\\Delta G'^{\\circ}$, will produce the largest flux increase.**\nThe failure of PGI overexpression is due to the near-equilibrium nature of the reaction, not a specific Michaelis constant value (which is not provided). Aldolase, despite having a large positive $\\Delta G'^{\\circ}$ (around $+23.8$ kJ mol$^{-1}$), operates near-equilibrium in the cell ($\\Delta G' \\approx 0$) because its products are rapidly consumed, keeping their concentrations very low. Therefore, overexpressing aldolase, a near-equilibrium enzyme, would not significantly increase flux.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. PGI failed to increase flux because glucose transport is rate-limiting at steady state; overexpressing hexokinase will produce the largest flux increase by trapping more glucose.**\nThis statement contradicts a direct premise of the problem, which states that \"extracellular glucose supply and transport are nonlimiting.\" Thus, the reason provided for PGI's ineffectiveness is invalid according to the problem setup.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. PGI failed to increase flux because it consumes ATP near the entry of glycolysis; overexpressing pyruvate kinase, which produces ATP at the end of glycolysis, will produce the largest flux increase by increasing the net ATP yield per glucose.**\nThe PGI reaction (G6P $\\rightleftharpoons$ F6P) is an isomerization and does not involve ATP consumption or production. The statement makes a factually incorrect claim about the biochemistry of PGI. Hexokinase and PFK-1 consume ATP in the preparatory phase of glycolysis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2572255"}, {"introduction": "After identifying regulatory enzymes, we must understand their kinetic behavior.

Adopt the following principled base: (i) the quasi-steady-state assumption for enzyme catalysis linking reaction velocity to the fractional occupancy of an active state, (ii) mass action for ligand binding, and (iii) the empirical Hill cooperative binding isotherm connecting fractional occupancy to substrate concentration via a cooperativity exponent. Using this base, your task is to perform parameter estimation by nonlinear least squares for a cooperative velocity model and then return quantitative estimates of the characteristic concentration and cooperativity.\n\nImplement a program that, given multiple independent measurement sets consisting of glucose concentration values and velocities, fits a cooperative model with three positive parameters: maximal velocity, characteristic concentration, and Hill exponent. Use a numerical optimizer to minimize the sum of squared residuals between observed and model-predicted velocities, enforcing positivity of all parameters and constraining the Hill exponent to a reasonable physiological range. From each fit, report only the characteristic concentration and the Hill exponent.\n\nScientific and physiological framing for interpretation after fitting: in hepatocytes, glucokinase behaves as a glucose sensor because its cooperative response yields a steep change in flux across a physiologically relevant glucose range.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in the field of biochemical kinetics, with all necessary data and constraints for a unique solution provided. No inconsistencies, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness are present. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to estimate parameters for a cooperative enzyme kinetics model from experimental data. The solution is founded on three principles stipulated in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, the quasi-steady-state assumption for enzyme catalysis provides the link between reaction velocity, $v$, and the concentration of the catalytically active enzyme-substrate complex. The velocity is directly proportional to the fractional occupancy, $Y$, of the enzyme's active state by the substrate. This relationship is expressed as:\n$$\nv = V_{\\max} \\cdot Y\n$$\nwhere $V_{\\max}$ is the maximal velocity achieved when the enzyme is fully saturated with substrate ($Y=1$).\n\nSecond and third, the principles of mass action and the empirical Hill cooperative binding isotherm are used to model the fractional occupancy $Y$ as a function of the substrate concentration, $[S]$. The Hill equation is a phenomenological model that describes cooperative binding to a macromolecule. It is given by:\n$$\nY([S]) = \\frac{[S]^n}{S_{0.5}^n + [S]^n}\n$$\nHere, $S_{0.5}$ is the characteristic concentration of the substrate at which half of the maximal velocity is observed (i.e., $Y=0.5$). The parameter $n$ is the Hill exponent, a dimensionless measure of cooperativity. If $n > 1$, the system exhibits positive cooperativity (sigmoidal response). If $n = 1$, the equation simplifies to the non-cooperative Michaelis-Menten form (hyperbolic response). If $n  1$, the system shows negative cooperativity.\n\nCombining these principles yields the complete model for reaction velocity, which is the Hill equation for enzyme kinetics:\n$$\nv([S]) = V_{\\max} \\frac{[S]^n}{S_{0.5}^n + [S]^n}\n$$\nThis is the model to be fitted to the four provided datasets. The parameters to be estimated are $V_{\\max}$, $S_{0.5}$, and $n$.\n\nThe estimation is performed via nonlinear least squares. This involves finding the parameter set $(V_{\\max}, S_{0.5}, n)$ that minimizes the sum of squared residuals (SSR) between the observed velocities, $v_{\\text{obs},i}$, and the model-predicted velocities, $v_{\\text{model},i}$, for each substrate concentration $[S_i]$:\n$$\n\\text{SSR}(V_{\\max}, S_{0.5}, n) = \\sum_{i} (v_{\\text{obs},i} - v_{\\text{model}}([S_i]; V_{\\max}, S_{0.5}, n))^2\n$$\nThis is a numerical optimization problem. We will use the L-BFGS-B algorithm, as implemented in the `scipy.optimize.minimize` library function, which is suitable for this task and can handle parameter bounds. The optimization is subject to the following constraints specified in the problem: $V_{\\max} > 0$, $S_{0.5} > 0$, and $0.5 \\le n \\le 5.0$. For numerical stability, the lower bounds for $V_{\\max}$ and $S_{0.5}$ are set to a small positive value ($10^{-9}$).\n\nThe initial guesses for the optimization routine are derived from the data for each case as specified:\n1.  Initial $V_{\\max}$: The maximum observed velocity, $\\max(v_{\\text{obs}})$.\n2.  Initial $S_{0.5}$: The substrate concentration $[S_i]$ corresponding to the observed velocity $v_{\\text{obs},i}$ that is closest to $0.5 \\cdot \\max(v_{\\text{obs}})$.\n3.  Initial $n$: A constant value of $1.5$.\n\nAfter performing the numerical fitting for each of the four cases, we obtain the optimal values for $S_{0.5}$ and $n$.\n\nCase 1 fit results: $S_{0.5} \\approx 8.123$ mM, $n \\approx 1.634$.\nCase 2 fit results: $S_{0.5} \\approx 3.974$ mM, $n \\approx 1.107$.\nCase 3 fit results: $S_{0.5} \\approx 8.000$ mM, $n \\approx 3.003$.\nCase 4 fit results: $S_{0.5} \\approx 3.472$ mM, $n \\approx 2.502$.\n\nThese results provide a quantitative description of the enzyme's kinetic behavior. The value of $n > 1$ in all cases, particularly in cases $1$, $3$, and $4$, confirms the positive cooperativity characteristic of glucokinase.\n\nThe physiological significance of these parameters for glucokinase as a hepatic glucose sensor is profound. The estimated $S_{0.5}$ values (e.g., ~$8$ mM in cases $1$ and $3$) are near the physiological fasting blood glucose concentration (around $5$ mM). The cooperativity, quantified by $n \\approx 1.6 - 3.0$, creates a sigmoidal, or S-shaped, response curve. This is critically different from a non-cooperative Michaelis-Menten enzyme ($n=1$), which would have a hyperbolic response.\n\nThe steepness of the sigmoidal curve means that a small change in glucose concentration around $S_{0.5}$ results in a large change in reaction velocity. When blood glucose rises after a meal (e.g., to $10-15$ mM), glucokinase activity increases sharply, leading to rapid phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. This traps glucose inside the hepatocyte for conversion to glycogen or for catabolism via glycolysis. Conversely, when blood glucose is low (below $5$ mM), the enzyme's activity is minimal, thus sparing glucose for tissues with an absolute requirement, such as the brain. This \"switch-like\" behavior, finely tuned by the values of $S_{0.5}$ and $n$, allows the liver to effectively buffer blood glucose levels, a function for which low-$S_{0.5}$ non-cooperative hexokinases are unsuited as they are saturated at all physiological glucose concentrations.

This practice examines the Cori cycle, a vital inter-organ partnership between muscle and liver during anaerobic exercise. By performing a detailed stoichiometric analysis, you will calculate the net energetic cost of this cycle, revealing the physiological price of metabolic flexibility and homeostasis [@problem_id:2572210].", "problem": "A human subject performs intense exercise under oxygen-limited conditions such that skeletal muscle operates anaerobically and converts glucose to lactate via glycolysis, while the liver reconverts circulating lactate to glucose via gluconeogenesis (the Cori cycle). Assume the following:\n\n- Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) is energetically equivalent to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) because nucleoside diphosphate kinase maintains near-equilibrium between adenine and guanine nucleotides; count each GTP hydrolyzed as one ATP equivalent.\n- Transport of metabolites between tissues has no additional energetic cost under the conditions considered.\n- Reducing equivalents are accounted for explicitly using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and its oxidized form (NAD^{+}), and standard cytosolic directions of the glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes apply in muscle and liver, respectively.\n- Carbon and electron balances must be respected, and only canonical reactions of glycolysis, lactate dehydrogenase, and gluconeogenesis are used. Ignore minor proton and water stoichiometric terms that do not affect the count of high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds.\n\nStarting from conservation of matter and charge and from the accepted stepwise reactions of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, derive the overall stoichiometry for one full Cori cycle turn defined as: skeletal muscle consumes one molecule of glucose to produce lactate, the liver takes the resulting two molecules of lactate to regenerate one molecule of glucose, and the glucose returns to muscle.\n\nThen, from your stoichiometry, compute the organism-level net number of ATP equivalents produced or consumed per such cycle. Report your final answer as a single signed integer, where a positive sign indicates net production by the organism and a negative sign indicates net consumption. Do not include any units. No rounding is needed.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes the Cori cycle, a fundamental concept in metabolic biochemistry, using standard assumptions and simplifications. All necessary information is provided, and the premises are consistent with established scientific principles. The problem is therefore valid, and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe task is to determine the net energetic cost, in terms of adenosine triphosphate ($\\text{ATP}$) equivalents, for one complete turn of the Cori cycle. This cycle involves two coupled processes: the anaerobic conversion of glucose to lactate in skeletal muscle, and the reconversion of lactate to glucose in the liver. We will analyze the stoichiometry of each process separately and then sum them to find the overall net reaction for the organism.\n\nFirst, we analyze the metabolic pathway in the skeletal muscle under anaerobic conditions. This involves glycolysis followed by lactate fermentation.\n\nThe overall balanced chemical equation for glycolysis, converting one molecule of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate, is:\n$$ \\text{Glucose} + 2\\,\\text{ADP} + 2\\,\\text{P}_i + 2\\,\\text{NAD}^+ \\rightarrow 2\\,\\text{Pyruvate} + 2\\,\\text{ATP} + 2\\,\\text{NADH} + 2\\,\\text{H}^+ $$\nIn this equation, $\\text{P}_i$ represents inorganic phosphate, and $\\text{NAD}^+ / \\text{NADH}$ represent the oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Under anaerobic conditions, the cell must regenerate $\\text{NAD}^+$ from the $\\text{NADH}$ produced during glycolysis to sustain the pathway. This is accomplished by the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase, which reduces pyruvate to lactate:\n$$ 2\\,\\text{Pyruvate} + 2\\,\\text{NADH} + 2\\,\\text{H}^+ \\rightarrow 2\\,\\text{Lactate} + 2\\,\\text{NAD}^+ $$\nTo obtain the net reaction for anaerobic glycolysis in the muscle, we sum these two reactions. The intermediates $2\\,\\text{Pyruvate}$, $2\\,\\text{NADH}$, $2\\,\\text{H}^+$, and $2\\,\\text{NAD}^+$ cancel out.\n$$ (\\text{Glucose} + 2\\,\\text{ADP} + 2\\,\\text{P}_i + 2\\,\\text{NAD}^+) + (2\\,\\text{Pyruvate} + 2\\,\\text{NADH} + 2\\,\\text{H}^+) \\rightarrow (2\\,\\text{Pyruvate} + 2\\,\\text{ATP} + 2\\,\\text{NADH} + 2\\,\\text{H}^+) + (2\\,\\text{Lactate} + 2\\,\\text{NAD}^+) $$\nThe resulting net stoichiometry for the muscle tissue is:\n$$ \\text{Glucose} + 2\\,\\text{ADP} + 2\\,\\text{P}_i \\rightarrow 2\\,\\text{Lactate} + 2\\,\\text{ATP} $$\nThis equation shows that for each molecule of glucose consumed, the muscle tissue achieves a net production of $2$ molecules of $\\text{ATP}$.\n\nNext, we analyze the metabolic pathway in the liver, which is gluconeogenesis from the two molecules of lactate transported from the muscle. This process is essentially the reverse of anaerobic glycolysis but requires bypassing the irreversible steps of glycolysis, which has an energetic cost.\n\nFirst, lactate is converted back to pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase:\n$$ 2\\,\\text{Lactate} + 2\\,\\text{NAD}^+ \\rightarrow 2\\,\\text{Pyruvate} + 2\\,\\text{NADH} + 2\\,\\text{H}^+ $$\nThe two molecules of pyruvate are then converted to one molecule of glucose via gluconeogenesis. The established overall stoichiometry for this pathway is:\n$$ 2\\,\\text{Pyruvate} + 4\\,\\text{ATP} + 2\\,\\text{GTP} + 2\\,\\text{NADH} + 2\\,\\text{H}^+ \\rightarrow \\text{Glucose} + 4\\,\\text{ADP} + 2\\,\\text{GDP} + 6\\,\\text{P}_i + 2\\,\\text{NAD}^+ $$\nHere, $\\text{GTP}$ represents guanosine triphosphate and $\\text{GDP}$ represents guanosine diphosphate. The $2\\,\\text{NADH}$ and $2\\,\\text{H}^+$ required for this process are supplied by the initial conversion of lactate to pyruvate. To find the net reaction in the liver, we sum the two liver-based reactions. The intermediates $2\\,\\text{Pyruvate}$, $2\\,\\text{NADH}$, $2\\,\\text{H}^+$, and $2\\,\\text{NAD}^+$ cancel.\n$$ (2\\,\\text{Lactate} + 2\\,\\text{NAD}^+) + (2\\,\\text{Pyruvate} + 4\\,\\text{ATP} + 2\\,\\text{GTP} + 2\\,\\text{NADH} + 2\\,\\text{H}^+) \\rightarrow (2\\,\\text{Pyruvate} + 2\\,\\text{NADH} + 2\\,\\text{H}^+) + (\\text{Glucose} + 4\\,\\text{ADP} + 2\\,\\text{GDP} + 6\\,\\text{P}_i + 2\\,\\text{NAD}^+) $$\nThe resulting net stoichiometry for the liver tissue is:\n$$ 2\\,\\text{Lactate} + 4\\,\\text{ATP} + 2\\,\\text{GTP} \\rightarrow \\text{Glucose} + 4\\,\\text{ADP} + 2\\,\\text{GDP} + 6\\,\\text{P}_i $$\nAccording to the problem statement, $\\text{GTP}$ is energetically equivalent to $\\text{ATP}$. Thus, the total energetic cost in the liver is the consumption of $4$ molecules of $\\text{ATP}$ and $2$ molecules of $\\text{GTP}$, which is equivalent to the consumption of $6$ molecules of $\\text{ATP}$.\n\nFinally, to derive the overall stoichiometry and net energy balance for one full turn of the Cori cycle, we sum the net reactions from the muscle and the liver.\n$$ \\begin{matrix} \\text{Muscle:}  \\text{Glucose} + 2\\,\\text{ADP} + 2\\,\\text{P}_i  \\rightarrow  2\\,\\text{Lactate} + 2\\,\\text{ATP} \\\\ \\text{Liver:}  2\\,\\text{Lactate} + 4\\,\\text{ATP} + 2\\,\\text{GTP}  \\rightarrow  \\text{Glucose} + 4\\,\\text{ADP} + 2\\,\\text{GDP} + 6\\,\\text{P}_i \\\\ \\hline \\end{matrix} $$\nSumming these equations, the metabolites Glucose and $2\\,\\text{Lactate}$ appear on both sides and thus cancel, as they are cycled between the tissues.\n$$ (\\text{Glucose} + 2\\,\\text{ADP} + 2\\,\\text{P}_i) + (2\\,\\text{Lactate} + 4\\,\\text{ATP} + 2\\,\\text{GTP}) \\rightarrow (2\\,\\text{Lactate} + 2\\,\\text{ATP}) + (\\text{Glucose} + 4\\,\\text{ADP} + 2\\,\\text{GDP} + 6\\,\\text{P}_i) $$\nThis simplifies to the net organism-level reaction involving only the energy-carrying molecules:\n$$ 2\\,\\text{ADP} + 2\\,\\text{P}_i + 4\\,\\text{ATP} + 2\\,\\text{GTP} \\rightarrow 2\\,\\text{ATP} + 4\\,\\text{ADP} + 2\\,\\text{GDP} + 6\\,\\text{P}_i $$\nTo reveal the net change, we subtract the common terms ($2\\,\\text{ATP}$, $2\\,\\text{ADP}$, $2\\,\\text{P}_i$) from both sides of the equation:\n$$ 2\\,\\text{ATP} + 2\\,\\text{GTP} \\rightarrow 2\\,\\text{ADP} + 2\\,\\text{GDP} + 4\\,\\text{P}_i $$\nUsing the energetic equivalence of $\\text{GTP}$ and $\\text{ATP}$ (and thus $\\text{GDP}$ and $\\text{ADP}$), the overall stoichiometry for the cycle is:\n$$ 4\\,\\text{ATP}_{\\text{eq}} \\rightarrow 4\\,\\text{ADP}_{\\text{eq}} + 4\\,\\text{P}_i $$\nThis equation represents the net hydrolysis of $4$ high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds. Therefore, one complete turn of the Cori cycle results in a net consumption of $4$ $\\text{ATP}$ equivalents by the organism.\n\nThe problem requires a single signed integer, with a negative sign indicating net consumption. The net change is a consumption of $4$ $\\text{ATP}$ equivalents.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-4}$$", "id": "2572210"}]}
