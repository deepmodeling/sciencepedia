The problem is scientifically sound and well-posed.\n\n1. Derivation of the linear relation between freezing point depression and osmolality.\n\nThe fundamental condition for phase equilibrium between a pure solid solvent (ice) and a liquid solution at the freezing temperature $T_f$ and constant pressure $P$ is the equality of the chemical potential of the solvent (water, subscript $w$) in both phases:\n$$\n\\mu_{w}^{*}(s, T_f, P) = \\mu_{w}(l, T_f, P, x_w)\n$$\nHere, $\\mu_{w}^{*}(s)$ is the chemical potential of pure solid water, and $\\mu_{w}(l)$ is the chemical potential of water in the liquid solution, which depends on its mole fraction $x_w$.\n\nFor an ideal or ideally dilute solution, the chemical potential of the solvent is related to the chemical potential of the pure liquid solvent, $\\mu_{w}^{*}(l)$, by:\n$$\n\\mu_{w}(l, T_f, P, x_w) = \\mu_{w}^{*}(l, T_f, P) + R T_f \\ln(a_w)\n$$\nwhere $a_w$ is the activity of the solvent. The problem states to assume ideal dilute behavior, where the activity is approximated by the mole fraction, $a_w \\approx x_w$. Substituting this into the equilibrium condition gives:\n$$\n\\mu_{w}^{*}(s, T_f, P) = \\mu_{w}^{*}(l, T_f, P) + R T_f \\ln(x_w)\n$$\nRearranging this equation yields:\n$$\n\\mu_{w}^{*}(s, T_f, P) - \\mu_{w}^{*}(l, T_f, P) = R T_f \\ln(x_w)\n$$\nThe left-hand side is the molar Gibbs free energy of fusion for the pure solvent at temperature $T_f$, denoted as $\\Delta G_{fus,m}(T_f)$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta G_{fus,m}(T_f)}{T_f} = R \\ln(x_w)\n$$\nTo relate this to the freezing point depression, we employ the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, which describes the temperature dependence of the Gibbs free energy:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial (\\Delta G/T)}{\\partial T} \\right)_P = -\\frac{\\Delta H}{T^2}\n$$\nApplying this to our process (fusion), we integrate from the normal freezing point of the pure solvent, $T_f^0$, to the freezing point of the solution, $T_f$:\n$$\n\\int_{T_f^0}^{T_f} d\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_{fus,m}}{T}\\right) = \\int_{T_f^0}^{T_f} -\\frac{\\Delta H_{fus,m}(T)}{T^2} dT\n$$\nAt the normal freezing point $T_f^0$, the pure solid and liquid phases are in equilibrium, so $\\Delta G_{fus,m}(T_f^0) = 0$. The integration of the left side gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta G_{fus,m}(T_f)}{T_f} - \\frac{\\Delta G_{fus,m}(T_f^0)}{T_f^0} = \\frac{\\Delta G_{fus,m}(T_f)}{T_f} - 0 = R \\ln(x_w)\n$$\nAssuming the molar enthalpy of fusion, $\\Delta H_{fus,m}$, is constant over the small temperature range between $T_f^0$ and $T_f$, we can take it out of the integral on the right side:\n$$\nR \\ln(x_w) = -\\Delta H_{fus,m} \\int_{T_f^0}^{T_f} \\frac{1}{T^2} dT = -\\Delta H_{fus,m} \\left[-\\frac{1}{T}\\right]_{T_f^0}^{T_f} = \\Delta H_{fus,m} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_f} - \\frac{1}{T_f^0}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nR \\ln(x_w) = \\Delta H_{fus,m} \\left(\\frac{T_f^0 - T_f}{T_f T_f^0}\\right)\n$$\nThe freezing point depression is defined as $\\Delta T_f = T_f^0 - T_f$. For a small depression, we can make the approximation $T_f T_f^0 \\approx (T_f^0)^2$.\n$$\nR \\ln(x_w) \\approx \\frac{\\Delta H_{fus,m} \\Delta T_f}{(T_f^0)^2}\n$$\nFor a dilute solution, the mole fraction of the solvent is $x_w = 1 - x_s$, where $x_s$ is the total mole fraction of all solute particles. As $x_s \\ll 1$, we can use the Taylor series expansion $\\ln(1-z) \\approx -z$. Thus, $\\ln(x_w) = \\ln(1 - x_s) \\approx -x_s$.\n$$\n-R x_s \\approx \\frac{\\Delta H_{fus,m} \\Delta T_f}{(T_f^0)^2}\n$$\nThe mole fraction of solute, $x_s$, is defined as $x_s = \\frac{n_s}{n_s + n_w}$, where $n_s$ is the total moles of solute particles and $n_w$ is the moles of solvent. For a dilute solution, $n_s \\ll n_w$, so $x_s \\approx \\frac{n_s}{n_w}$.\nOsmolality, $m_{\\mathrm{osm}}$, is defined as the moles of solute particles per kilogram of solvent: $m_{\\mathrm{osm}} = n_s / W_w$, where $W_w$ is the mass of the solvent in kg. The moles of solvent can be written as $n_w = W_w / M_w$, where $M_w$ is the molar mass of the solvent in $\\mathrm{kg \\, mol^{-1}}$.\nSubstituting these relations, we find $x_s \\approx \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{osm}} W_w}{W_w/M_w} = m_{\\mathrm{osm}} M_w$.\nLet's re-examine the derivation.\nEquilibrium gives $R T_f \\ln(x_w) = \\mu_{w}^{*}(s, T_f) - \\mu_{w}^{*}(l, T_f) = -\\Delta G_{fus,m}(T_f)$.\nGibbs-Helmholtz integration gives $\\frac{\\Delta G_{fus,m}(T_f)}{T_f} = \\Delta H_{fus,m} (\\frac{1}{T_f} - \\frac{1}{T_f^0}) = \\frac{\\Delta H_{fus,m} \\Delta T_f}{T_f T_f^0}$.\nCombining these: $-R \\ln x_w = \\frac{\\Delta H_{fus,m} \\Delta T_f}{T_f T_f^0}$. This relation is correct, as $\\ln x_w$ is negative, so the LHS is positive, and the RHS is also positive.\nUsing approximations $\\ln x_w \\approx -x_s$, $T_f T_f^0 \\approx (T_f^0)^2$, and $x_s \\approx m_{\\mathrm{osm}} M_w$:\n$$\n-R (-x_s) \\approx \\frac{\\Delta H_{fus,m} \\Delta T_f}{(T_f^0)^2}\n\\implies R x_s \\approx \\frac{\\Delta H_{fus,m} \\Delta T_f}{(T_f^0)^2}\n$$\n$$\nR (m_{\\mathrm{osm}} M_w) \\approx \\frac{\\Delta H_{fus,m} \\Delta T_f}{(T_f^0)^2}\n$$\nSolving for $\\Delta T_f$:\n$$\n\\Delta T_f \\approx \\left( \\frac{R (T_f^0)^2 M_w}{\\Delta H_{fus,m}} \\right) m_{\\mathrm{osm}}\n$$\nThis is the linear relation $\\Delta T_f = K_f m_{\\mathrm{osm}}$. The constant of proportionality is the cryoscopic constant, $K_f$, expressed in terms of fundamental thermodynamic quantities:\n$$\nK_f = \\frac{R (T_f^0)^2 M_w}{\\Delta H_{fus,m}}\n$$\nHere, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $T_f^0$ is the freezing point of the pure solvent, $M_w$ is the molar mass of the solvent (in $\\mathrm{kg \\, mol^{-1}}$), and $\\Delta H_{fus,m}$ is the standard molar enthalpy of fusion of the solvent.\n\n2. Calculation of the sample's osmolality.\n\nThe derived relationship is $\\Delta T_f = K_f m_{\\mathrm{osm}}$. We rearrange to solve for osmolality, $m_{\\mathrm{osm}}$:\n$$\nm_{\\mathrm{osm}} = \\frac{\\Delta T_f}{K_f}\n$$\nThe given values are:\n- Freezing point depression $\\Delta T_f = 0.93~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. A temperature difference is equivalent in degrees Celsius and Kelvin, so $\\Delta T_f = 0.93~\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Cryoscopic constant of water $K_f = 1.86~\\mathrm{K \\, kg \\, mol^{-1}}$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\nm_{\\mathrm{osm}} = \\frac{0.93~\\mathrm{K}}{1.86~\\mathrm{K \\, kg \\, mol^{-1}}} = 0.5~\\mathrm{mol \\, kg^{-1}}\n$$\nThe unit $\\mathrm{mol \\, kg^{-1}}$ in this context refers to moles of osmotically active particles per kilogram of solvent, which is by definition an osmolality. Therefore, the result is $0.5~\\mathrm{osmol \\, kg^{-1}}$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to two significant figures. The calculated value $0.50$ has two significant figures.\n$$\nm_{\\mathrm{osm}} = 0.50~\\mathrm{osmol \\, kg^{-1}}\n$$\n\n3. Explanation of non-ideal solute behavior.\n\nIn real solutions, particularly physiological fluids containing electrolytes, the relationship between freezing point depression and the stoichiometric molality ($m_b$) is not simple. The stoichiometric molality is calculated from the mass of solute and its formula weight, without considering its behavior in solution. Two concepts, the van 't Hoff factor $i$ and the osmotic coefficient $\\phi$, are used to account for deviations from ideality, such as dissociation and association.\n\nThe **van 't Hoff factor ($i$)** is the ratio of the experimentally measured osmolality ($m_{\\mathrm{osm}}$) to the stoichiometric molality ($m_b$):\n$$\ni = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{osm}}}{m_b}\n$$\nThus, the freezing point depression is given by $\\Delta T_f = K_f (i \\cdot m_b)$.\n- For **strong dissociation**, such as an electrolyte like $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ dissociating into $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$, the number of particles in solution increases. For $\\mathrm{NaCl}$, one formula unit produces two ions, so ideally $i = 2$. Due to electrostatic interactions (ion pairing) in a real solution, the effective number of independent particles is reduced, making $i$ slightly less than $2$ (e.g., $i \\approx 1.87$ for $0.15~\\mathrm{M}$ $\\mathrm{NaCl}$).\n- For **strong association**, such as the formation of micelles by surfactant molecules or dimerization of carboxylic acids in nonpolar solvents, multiple solute molecules combine into a single larger particle. This reduces the total number of independent particles in solution, resulting in $i < 1$.\n\nThe **osmotic coefficient ($\\phi$)** provides a more rigorous description of non-ideality in the solvent activity, which is the ultimate source of colligative properties. It is defined through the solvent activity $a_w$ as $\\ln(a_w) = -\\phi \\nu m_b M_w$, where $\\nu$ is the number of particles produced per formula unit of solute upon dissociation (for a non-electrolyte, $\\nu=1$). In an ideal solution, $\\phi = 1$. In real electrolyte solutions, inter-ionic forces cause $\\phi < 1$.\nThe measured osmolality is related to the stoichiometric molality and the osmotic coefficient by:\n$$\nm_{\\mathrm{osm}} = \\phi \\nu m_b\n$$\nBy comparing this with the definition of the van 't Hoff factor ($m_{\\mathrm{osm}} = i m_b$), we see that $i = \\phi \\nu$.\n\nIn the context of cell volume regulation, the measured osmolality, $m_{\\mathrm{osm}}$, is the physiologically critical parameter. It reflects the total concentration of all osmotically active particles and therefore dictates the osmotic pressure gradient across a cell membrane, which drives water movement. A direct measurement of $\\Delta T_f$ yields this effective osmolality, bypassing the complexities of knowing the individual concentrations and non-ideal behaviors (i.e., the values of $i$ or $\\phi$) of all solutes in a complex fluid like blood plasma. This measurement provides a holistic view of the fluid's osmotic state, which is essential for diagnosing and managing conditions related to hydration and electrolyte imbalance.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.50}\n$$", "id": "2590087"}, {"introduction": "A solution's total osmolarity does not, by itself, determine its effect on cell volume; the permeability of the membrane to the solutes is paramount.

Let $N_{in,np}$ be this quantity. It is constant for all time.\n$2$. Osmotic equilibrium for water. Water moves across the cell membrane to equalize the effective osmotic pressure, $\\Pi_{eff}$.

All intracellular solutes are stated to be nonpermeant, so their reflection coefficient is $\\sigma_{in,np} = 1$. The initial volume is $V_0$.\nThe number of nonpermeant osmoles inside the cell is $N_{in,np} = C_{in,0} \\cdot V_0 = 300 \\cdot V_0$. This quantity is conserved.\n\nNew extracellular state ($t \\ge 0$): The external solution is composed of $100 \\text{ mM}$ sodium chloride (NaCl) and $100 \\text{ mM}$ urea.\nThe osmolarity contributions are:\nFor NaCl (ideal monovalent salt): $C_{NaCl} = 100 \\text{ mM} \\times 2 \\text{ osmoles/mole} = 200 \\text{ mOsm/L}$. NaCl is nonpermeant, so its reflection coefficient is $\\sigma_{NaCl} = 1$.\nFor urea: $C_{urea} = 100 \\text{ mM} \\times 1 \\text{ osmole/mole} = 100 \\text{ mOsm/L}$. Urea is freely permeant, so its reflection coefficient is $\\sigma_{urea} \\approx 0$.\nThe total extracellular osmolarity is $C_{out,total} = C_{NaCl} + C_{urea} = 200 + 100 = 300 \\text{ mOsm/L}$.\n\n**Part 1: Counterexample for \"isotonic equals iso-osmolar\"**\nThe term **iso-osmolar** means that the total osmolarity of the external solution is equal to the initial total osmolarity of the cell's interior. Here, $C_{out,total} = 300 \\text{ mOsm/L}$ and $C_{in,0} = 300 \\text{ mOsm/L}$, so the new solution is indeed iso-osmolar to the cell.\nThe term **isotonic** means that the external solution causes no net change in cell volume. The change in cell volume is driven by water movement, which is governed by the difference in *effective* osmolarity (also called tonicity).\nLet us calculate the effective osmolarities.\nThe initial effective intracellular osmolarity is $C_{in,eff,0} = \\sigma_{in,np} C_{in,0} = 1 \\times 300 \\text{ mOsm/L} = 300 \\text{ mOsm/L}$.\nThe effective extracellular osmolarity of the new solution is $C_{out,eff} = \\sigma_{NaCl} C_{NaCl} + \\sigma_{urea} C_{urea} = (1)(200 \\text{ mOsm/L}) + (0)(100 \\text{ mOsm/L}) = 200 \\text{ mOsm/L}$.\nAt the moment of the switch ($t=0$), we have $C_{in,eff,0} > C_{out,eff}$. This imbalance in effective osmotic pressure ($300 \\text{ mOsm/L}$ inside versus $200 \\text{ mOsm/L}$ outside) creates a water potential gradient that drives water into the cell, causing it to swell. A solution that causes a cell to swell is defined as **hypotonic**.\nThus, we have a solution that is iso-osmolar ($300 \\text{ mOsm/L}$) but hypotonic. This serves as the required counterexample and demonstrates that the two terms are not synonymous, especially in the presence of permeant solutes.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of volume ratios $V_{\\mathrm{init}}/V_0$ and $V_{\\infty}/V_0$**\nThe volume of the cell adjusts to maintain water equilibrium. The condition for water equilibrium at any time $t > 0$ is that the effective intracellular osmolarity equals the effective extracellular osmolarity.\nThe effective extracellular osmolarity, $C_{out,eff}$, is constant for all $t \\ge 0$ at $200 \\text{ mOsm/L}$.\nThe effective intracellular osmolarity at a time $t$ when the cell volume is $V(t)$ depends on the concentrations of solutes inside the cell. The intracellular solutes are the original nonpermeant ones and any urea that has entered.\n$C_{in,eff}(t) = \\sigma_{in,np} C_{in,np}(t) + \\sigma_{urea} C_{in,urea}(t)$.\nThe concentration of nonpermeant solutes is $C_{in,np}(t) = \\frac{N_{in,np}}{V(t)} = \\frac{300 \\cdot V_0}{V(t)}$.\nSince $\\sigma_{in,np}=1$ and $\\sigma_{urea}=0$, the effective intracellular osmolarity simplifies to:\n$C_{in,eff}(t) = (1) \\left(\\frac{300 \\cdot V_0}{V(t)}\\right) + (0) \\cdot C_{in,urea}(t) = \\frac{300 \\cdot V_0}{V(t)}$.\nThe water equilibrium condition is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{300 \\cdot V_0}{V(t)} = C_{out,eff} = 200\n$$\nThis equation determines the volume of the cell at any time $t>0$, under the assumption that water movement is much faster than solute permeation. Solving for the volume $V(t)$:\n$$\nV(t) = \\frac{300}{200} V_0 = \\frac{3}{2} V_0\n$$\nThis result demonstrates that the cell volume rapidly expands to a new, constant value and does not change further as urea permeates.\n\nCalculation of $V_{\\mathrm{init}}/V_0$:\n$V_{\\mathrm{init}}$ is defined as the volume after rapid water equilibration but before significant urea entry. Our derived equation for $V(t)$ is directly applicable to this state.\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{init}} = \\frac{3}{2} V_0 \\implies \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{init}}}{V_0} = \\frac{3}{2}\n$$\n\nCalculation of $V_{\\infty}/V_0$:\n$V_{\\infty}$ is the final, steady-state volume after urea has also come to diffusional equilibrium ($C_{in,urea}(t_{\\infty}) = C_{out,urea} = 100 \\text{ mOsm/L}$). The water equilibrium condition must still hold at this final steady state. Therefore, the volume $V_{\\infty}$ is also determined by the same relationship:\n$$\nV_{\\infty} = \\frac{3}{2} V_0 \\implies \\frac{V_{\\infty}}{V_0} = \\frac{3}{2}\n$$\nThe cell swells rapidly to $1.5$ times its initial volume and remains at this new volume. The subsequent entry of urea does not cause further volume change because, with a reflection coefficient of zero, it exerts no effective osmotic pressure to drive water movement. At final equilibrium, the total internal osmolarity is $C_{in,np}(t_{\\infty}) + C_{in,urea}(t_{\\infty}) = \\frac{300 \\cdot V_0}{V_{\\infty}} + 100 = \\frac{300 \\cdot V_0}{(3/2)V_0} + 100 = 200 + 100 = 300 \\text{ mOsm/L}$, which matches the total external osmolarity, confirming the final state is stable.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{3}{2} & \\frac{3}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2590113"}, {"introduction": "The ability to distinguish between total and effective osmolality is not just theoretical; it is a practical skill essential for experimental design in cell biology.

Note that the term for the $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ contribution is precisely the effective osmolality, $\\Pi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n$$ \\Pi_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\Pi_{\\mathrm{eff}} + (i_{\\mathrm{gly}} \\phi_{\\mathrm{gly}} m_{\\mathrm{gly}}) $$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$ 0.300 = 0.200 + (1)(1.00) m_{\\mathrm{gly}} $$\n$$ 0.300 = 0.200 + m_{\\mathrm{gly}} $$\nSolving for $m_{\\mathrm{gly}}$:\n$$ m_{\\mathrm{gly}} = 0.300 - 0.200 = 0.100 \\frac{\\text{mol}}{\\text{kg}} $$\nThe problem specifies preparing the solution by dissolving the solutes in $1.000$ kg of water. Molality is defined as moles of solute per kilogram of solvent.\n$$ m = \\frac{\\text{moles}}{\\text{kg of solvent}} $$\nTherefore, the number of moles ($n$) required for each solute is numerically equal to its molality, since the mass of the solvent is $1.000$ kg.\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} = m_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} \\times 1.000 \\text{ kg} = \\frac{0.200}{1.86} \\text{ mol} $$\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{gly}} = m_{\\mathrm{gly}} \\times 1.000 \\text{ kg} = 0.100 \\text{ mol} $$\nFinally, we calculate the required mass of each solute by multiplying the number of moles by the respective molar mass ($M$).\n$$ \\text{mass}_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} = n_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} \\times M_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} = \\left(\\frac{0.200}{1.86}\\right) \\text{mol} \\times 58.44 \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{mol}} $$\n$$ \\text{mass}_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} \\approx (0.10752688...) \\times 58.44 \\approx 6.28443... \\text{ g} $$\n$$ \\text{mass}_{\\mathrm{gly}} = n_{\\mathrm{gly}} \\times M_{\\mathrm{gly}} = 0.100 \\text{ mol} \\times 92.094 \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{mol}} $$\n$$ \\text{mass}_{\\mathrm{gly}} = 9.2094 \\text{ g} $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\text{mass}_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} \\approx 6.284 \\text{ g} $$\n$$ \\text{mass}_{\\mathrm{gly}} \\approx 9.209 \\text{ g} $$\nThe final answer is to be presented as a row matrix containing the mass of $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ and the mass of glycerol, in that order.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 6.284 & 9.209 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2590118"}]}
