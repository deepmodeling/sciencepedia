The exact calculated value is $0.06$. To express this with four significant figures, we add trailing zeros.\n$$\\Delta S_{CD} = 0.06000$$\n\nFinally, two mechanistic limitations of the linear mixing approximation are required.\nFirst, the model neglects any specific stoichiometry or cooperativity in lipid-cholesterol interactions. Real membranes can exhibit the formation of so-called \"condensed complexes\" of lipid and cholesterol (e.g., at a $2:1$ or $1:1$ molar ratio). The formation of such specific complexes would lead to a non-linear dependence of membrane properties on cholesterol mole fraction $x$, as the system's behavior would be dominated by the properties of these complexes at particular concentrations, rather than a simple average effect.\nSecond, the model is a two-state approximation, assuming lipids are either \"unperturbed\" (state $0$) or \"perturbed\" (state $1$). This is a significant oversimplification. In reality, a lipid's motional freedom depends on its precise local environment. A lipid may have one, two, or more cholesterol molecules as nearest neighbors, or it may reside near the boundary of a cholesterol-rich domain. This creates a spectrum of perturbation states, not a single one. A more realistic model would average over a distribution of local environments, the probability of which is generally not a linear function of bulk composition $x$.
