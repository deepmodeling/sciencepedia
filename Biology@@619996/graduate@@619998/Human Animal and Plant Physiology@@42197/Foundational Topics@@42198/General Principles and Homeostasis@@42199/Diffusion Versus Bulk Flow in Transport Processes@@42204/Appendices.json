This phenomenon is mediated by solvent drag. The analysis will be conducted within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics, as applied to membrane transport.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the fundamental transport principles provided in the problem statement. The total molar flux of the solute per unit membrane area, $J_s$, is the linear superposition of two components: the diffusive flux, $J_{s,diff}$, and the convective flux (solvent drag), $J_{s,conv}$. The positive direction for all fluxes is from compartment $1$ to compartment $2$.\n\n$1$. The diffusive flux, governed by Fick's first law, is proportional to the concentration difference across the membrane. Given that diffusion occurs from a region of higher concentration to lower concentration, and $C_2 > C_1$, the diffusive flux is oriented from $2$ to $1$. In our sign convention, this flux is negative. It is given by:\n$$J_{s,diff} = P_s (C_1 - C_2)$$\nwhere $P_s$ is the solute permeability coefficient. Since $C_1  C_2$, this term is negative, correctly representing flux from $2$ to $1$.\n\n$2$. The convective flux is the transport of solute carried by the bulk flow of the solvent. This flux is proportional to the volume flux of the solvent, $J_v$, and the average concentration of the solute available for transport, $\\bar{C}$. The reflection coefficient, $\\sigma$, is the fraction of solute rejected by the membrane. Thus, the fraction of solute carried with the solvent is $(1-\\sigma)$. The convective flux is:\n$$J_{s,conv} = (1-\\sigma) J_v \\bar{C}$$\nwhere $\\bar{C} = (C_1 + C_2)/2$.\n\nThe total solute flux, $J_s$, is the sum of these two components:\n$$J_s = J_{s,diff} + J_{s,conv} = P_s (C_1 - C_2) + (1-\\sigma) J_v \\bar{C}$$\n\nNext, we define the volume flux, $J_v$. This flux is driven by the combined effects of the hydrostatic pressure difference, $\\Delta P = P_1 - P_2$, and the effective osmotic pressure difference, $\\sigma \\Delta \\pi$. The governing equation is:\n$$J_v = L_p (\\Delta P - \\sigma \\Delta \\pi)$$\nwhere $L_p$ is the hydraulic conductivity of the membrane. The osmotic pressure difference is $\\Delta \\pi = \\pi_1 - \\pi_2$. Using the ideal solute assumption, $\\pi = R T C$, we have:\n$$\\Delta \\pi = R T C_1 - R T C_2 = R T (C_1 - C_2)$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $J_v$:\n$$J_v = L_p [\\Delta P - \\sigma R T (C_1 - C_2)]$$\nNote that since $C_1  C_2$, the term $(C_1 - C_2)$ is negative. The term $-\\sigma R T (C_1 - C_2)$ is therefore positive, representing the osmotic flow of solvent from the compartment of lower solute concentration ($1$) to higher solute concentration ($2$).\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $J_v$ into the equation for $J_s$ to obtain a single equation for solute flux in terms of the primary driving forces:\n$$J_s = P_s (C_1 - C_2) + (1-\\sigma) \\bar{C} L_p [\\Delta P - \\sigma R T (C_1 - C_2)]$$\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum hydrostatic pressure difference, $\\Delta P_{min}$, required to produce a net \"uphill\" solute flux, meaning a flux from compartment $1$ to $2$. This corresponds to the condition $J_s > 0$. We establish this inequality:\n$$P_s (C_1 - C_2) + (1-\\sigma) \\bar{C} L_p [\\Delta P - \\sigma R T (C_1 - C_2)] > 0$$\nTo find the minimum pressure, we solve for the boundary case where $J_s = 0$. Any pressure infinitesimally greater than this boundary value will satisfy the inequality. Let this boundary pressure be $\\Delta P_{min}$.\n$$P_s (C_1 - C_2) + (1-\\sigma) \\bar{C} L_p [\\Delta P_{min} - \\sigma R T (C_1 - C_2)] = 0$$\nWe now solve for $\\Delta P_{min}$.\n$$(1-\\sigma) \\bar{C} L_p [\\Delta P_{min} - \\sigma R T (C_1 - C_2)] = -P_s (C_1 - C_2)$$\nSince $0 \\le \\sigma  1$, $L_p > 0$, and $\\bar{C} > 0$, the term $(1-\\sigma) \\bar{C} L_p$ is non-zero and positive.
