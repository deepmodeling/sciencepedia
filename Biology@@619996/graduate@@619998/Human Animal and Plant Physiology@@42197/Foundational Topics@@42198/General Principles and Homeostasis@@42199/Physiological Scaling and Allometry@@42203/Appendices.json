The problem is self-contained, consistent, and does not violate any fundamental principles. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be furnished.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing each of the three tasks in order.\n\nTask 1: Conversion of the scaling law to SI units.\nThe given relationship is:\n$$B_{kcd}(M_{b}) = 70 \\, M_{b}^{0.75}$$\nwhere $B_{kcd}$ is the basal metabolic rate in units of kilocalories per day (kcal/day) and $M_{b}$ is the body mass in kilograms (kg).

This exercise challenges you to act as a theoretical biologist by deriving predictions from two competing hypotheses for the scaling of weight-bearing bones: simple geometric similarity and the more sophisticated elastic similarity model, which accounts for the risk of buckling. By comparing these theoretical predictions to an observed scaling exponent, you will practice a fundamental scientific skill: using quantitative models to evaluate which mechanistic explanation best fits empirical evidence [@problem_id:2595061].", "problem": "In a comparative dataset of terrestrial mammals spanning several orders of magnitude in body mass, the cross-sectional diameter of the femur scales with body mass as an empirical power law with exponent $0.36$.

The givens are that body mass $M_{b}$ scales with a characteristic length $L$ as $M_{b} \\propto L^{3}$ (assuming constant body density $\\rho$) and that femoral diameter $d$ scales linearly with $L$, so $d \\propto L$. From the mass scaling relation, we express the characteristic length $L$ in terms of body mass $M_{b}$:\n$$\nL \\propto M_{b}^{1/3}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the proportionality for the diameter gives the relationship between femoral diameter $d$ and body mass $M_{b}$:\n$$\nd \\propto L \\propto M_{b}^{1/3}\n$$\nTherefore, the predicted power-law exponent under the hypothesis of geometric similarity is $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{geo}} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nSecond, we derive the scaling exponent under the hypothesis of elastic similarity. The specified constraints are as follows. The femur must resist Euler buckling, which implies that the critical buckling force $F_{c}$ must be proportional to the body weight, and thus to the body mass $M_{b}$. The critical force for a pinned-pinned column is given by $F_c \\propto E I / L^{2}$. The second moment of area for a circular cross-section is $I \\propto d^{4}$.
