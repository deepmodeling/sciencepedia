It describes a classic reaction-diffusion system based on fundamental principles of mass transport. All necessary parameters and boundary conditions are provided to derive a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is valid. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental principle is the conservation of mass for the dissolved oxygen. In a differential control volume, the rate of change of concentration, $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t}$, is balanced by the divergence of the flux, $-\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}$, and the rate of local production or consumption, $S$. This is expressed by the general continuity equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} + S\n$$\nThe problem specifies several conditions to simplify this general relation:\n1.  **Steady State**: The system is at steady state, so all time derivatives are zero. $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n2.  **Fick's First Law**: The flux, $\\mathbf{J}$, is due to diffusion only and is given by $\\mathbf{J} = -D \\nabla C$, where the diffusivity $D$ is a constant.\n3.  **Zeroth-Order Consumption**: Oxygen is consumed at a uniform, constant rate $q$. This represents a sink term, so $S = -q$.\n\nSubstituting these into the continuity equation yields the governing partial differential equation:\n$$\n0 = -\\nabla \\cdot (-D \\nabla C) - q\n$$\nSince $D$ is constant, it can be pulled out of the divergence operator:\n$$\n0 = D \\nabla^2 C - q\n$$\nThis is rearranged into the Poisson equation for the oxygen concentration $C$:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 C = \\frac{q}{D}\n$$\nThe problem states the tissue spheroid is approximately spherical and exhibits spherical symmetry. Therefore, the concentration $C$ is a function of the radial coordinate $r$ only, $C = C(r)$. In spherical coordinates, for a function that depends only on $r$, the Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2$ simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 C(r) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} \\right)\n$$\nThe governing equation becomes a second-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} \\right) = \\frac{q}{D}\n$$\nWe solve this equation by sequential integration. First, multiply by $r^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} \\right) = \\frac{q}{D} r^2\n$$\nIntegrating with respect to $r$ gives:\n$$\nr^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} = \\int \\frac{q}{D} r^2 dr = \\frac{q}{3D} r^3 + A\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the first constant of integration. To find $A$, we apply a boundary condition. Due to spherical symmetry, the concentration profile must be smooth at the center of the sphere ($r=0$). This implies that the concentration gradient must be zero at the center: $\\frac{dC}{dr}|_{r=0} = 0$. If the gradient were non-zero, it would imply a net flux originating or terminating at a single point, which is physically impossible.\nRearranging the previous equation for the gradient:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dr} = \\frac{q}{3D} r + \\frac{A}{r^2}\n$$\nFor the gradient to be finite (specifically, zero) as $r \\to 0$, the term $\\frac{A}{r^2}$ must not diverge. This is only possible if $A=0$. Thus, our first boundary condition forces $A=0$.\nThe equation for the gradient simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dr} = \\frac{q}{3D} r\n$$\nWe integrate a second time to find the concentration profile $C(r)$:\n$$\nC(r) = \\int \\frac{q}{3D} r dr = \\frac{q}{6D} r^2 + B\n$$\nwhere $B$ is the second constant of integration. To find $B$, we apply the second boundary condition, which is the fixed concentration at the surface of the spheroid: $C(R) = C_0$.\n$$\nC(R) = \\frac{q}{6D} R^2 + B = C_0\n$$\nSolving for $B$:\n$$\nB = C_0 - \\frac{q}{6D} R^2\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $B$ back into the equation for $C(r)$, we obtain the final steady-state oxygen concentration profile within the spheroid:\n$$\nC(r) = \\frac{q}{6D} r^2 + \\left( C_0 - \\frac{q}{6D} R^2 \\right) = C_0 - \\frac{q}{6D} (R^2 - r^2)\n$$\nThis profile is parabolic, with its maximum value $C_0$ at the surface ($r=R$) and its minimum value at the center ($r=0$).\n\nThe problem imposes the physiological requirement that the concentration must remain non-negative everywhere within the tissue, i.e., $C(r) \\ge 0$ for all $r \\in [0, R]$. Since the minimum concentration occurs at the center, this condition is satisfied if and only if $C(0) \\ge 0$.\nThe concentration at the center is:\n$$\nC(0) = C_0 - \\frac{q}{6D} (R^2 - 0^2) = C_0 - \\frac{q}{6D} R^2\n$$\nApplying the non-negativity constraint:\n$$\nC_0 - \\frac{q}{6D} R^2 \\ge 0\n$$\nWe rearrange this inequality to find the constraint on the radius $R$:\n$$\nC_0 \\ge \\frac{q}{6D} R^2 \\implies R^2 \\le \\frac{6DC_0}{q} \\implies R \\le \\sqrt{\\frac{6DC_0}{q}}\n$$\nThe maximum admissible radius, $R_{\\max}$, is the radius at which the central concentration becomes exactly zero. It is the upper bound of this inequality.\n$$\nR_{\\max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{6DC_0}{q}}\n$$\nIf the spheroid's radius $R$ exceeds $R_{\\max}$, its central region will become anoxic ($C(r) < 0$), which is physically impossible and signifies that the zeroth-order consumption model breaks down. A necrotic core would form.\n\nFinally, we relate this result to the surface area-to-volume (SA:V) ratio. For a sphere of radius $R$:\nSurface Area, $SA = 4\\pi R^2$\nVolume, $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$\nThe ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{SA}{V} = \\frac{4\\pi R^2}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3} = \\frac{3}{R}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the SA:V ratio scales as $R^{-1}$. As an object grows, its volume increases faster than its surface area, and this ratio decreases. The surface is the only interface for diffusive supply, while the entire volume represents the metabolic demand. The SA:V ratio is therefore a geometric measure of the capacity for supply relative to the magnitude of demand.\nAt the maximum radius $R_{\\max}$, the critical SA:V ratio is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{SA}{V}\\right)_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{3}{R_{\\max}} = 3 \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{6DC_0}{q}}\\right)^{-1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{9q}{6DC_0}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3q}{2DC_0}}\n$$\nThis critical ratio represents the minimum SA:V ratio required for the diffusive supply of oxygen to meet the metabolic demand of the entire volume without any part becoming anoxic. If the spheroid grows larger, its SA:V ratio falls below this critical value, and the supply becomes insufficient to maintain oxygenation at the center. The expression shows that a higher consumption rate $q$ or lower supply parameters $D$ and $C_0$ necessitate a larger SA:V ratio (i.e., a smaller size) to remain viable. This is the fundamental physical constraint limiting the size of avascular tissues.
