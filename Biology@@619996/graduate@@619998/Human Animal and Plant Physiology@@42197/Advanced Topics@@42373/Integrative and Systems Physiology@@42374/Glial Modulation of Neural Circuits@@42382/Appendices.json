This state of electrochemical equilibrium is achieved when the electrochemical potential of the ion is equal on both sides of the membrane. The electrochemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}_{j}$, for an ionic species $j$ is the sum of its chemical potential and its electrical potential energy per mole.

The resting membrane potential of a neuron is primarily determined by the high permeability of the membrane to potassium ions, mediated by potassium leak channels.

This positive change, $\\Delta E_{K} = +26.2\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, indicates a depolarization. Since the resting membrane potential closely follows $E_{K}$, the neuron's resting potential will also depolarize, bringing it closer to the threshold for firing an action potential and thus increasing its excitability.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{26.2}$$", "id": "2571266"}, {"introduction": "The efficiency of astrocytic potassium buffering is endowed by the specialized biophysical properties of inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels.

It is valid. The solution will proceed.\n\n---\n\n**Derivation and Calculation**\n\nFirst, we address the derivation requested in the problem statement. The net movement of an ion across a membrane is driven by the electrochemical potential difference. For a potassium-selective channel, the membrane potential at which there is no net current is the Nernst equilibrium potential for potassium, $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$. It is given by the Nernst equation:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{K}} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o}{[\\mathrm{K}^+]_i}\\right)$$\nFor a monovalent cation like $\\mathrm{K}^+$, the valence $z$ is $+1$. Thus:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{K}} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o}{[\\mathrm{K}^+]_i}\\right)$$\n\nThe problem states that the current-voltage relation can be linearized. This is an application of Ohm's law to ion channels. The net \"voltage\" driving the current of a specific ion is not the membrane potential $V_m$ itself, but the difference between $V_m$ and the ion's equilibrium potential, $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$. This difference, $(V_m - E_{\\mathrm{K}})$, is termed the electrochemical driving force. The current, $I_{\\mathrm{K}}$, is proportional to this driving force, where the constant of proportionality is the conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{K}}$.\n$$I_{\\mathrm{K}} = g_{\\mathrm{K}}\\,(V_m - E_{\\mathrm{K}})$$\nThis is the required expression. By convention, outward current (positive ion efflux) is positive, and inward current (positive ion influx) is negative.\n\nNext, we calculate $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ under the two specified conditions.\nThe intracellular potassium concentration is constant: $[\\mathrm{K}^+]_i = 140\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\nThe factor $RT/F$ is given as $26.7\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\n**1. Baseline Condition (before the burst):**\n$[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o = 3\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{K, baseline}} = (26.7\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{140}\\right) \\approx (26.7\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\times (-3.844) \\approx -102.6\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\nThe driving force is $V_m - E_{\\mathrm{K, baseline}} = -80\\,\\mathrm{mV} - (-102.6\\,\\mathrm{mV}) = +22.6\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\nSince the driving force is positive, the current is outward.\n\n**2. Burst Condition:**\n$[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o$ rises to $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{K, burst}} = (26.7\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{10}{140}\\right) \\approx (26.7\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\times (-2.639) \\approx -70.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\nThe driving force is $V_m - E_{\\mathrm{K, burst}} = -80\\,\\mathrm{mV} - (-70.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}) = -9.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\nSince the driving force is negative, the current is inward.\n\nThe rise in $[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o$ shifts $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ to a more positive value and reverses the direction of the $\\mathrm{K}^+$ current from outward to inward.\n\nFinally, we consider inward rectification. The conductance is not constant but depends on the direction of current.\n- For outward current ($V_m > E_{\\mathrm{K}}$), we use $g_{\\mathrm{out}} = 0.2\\,g_{\\mathrm{in}} = 0.2 \\times (5\\,\\mathrm{nS}) = 1\\,\\mathrm{nS}$.\n- For inward current ($V_m  E_{\\mathrm{K}}$), we use $g_{\\mathrm{in}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{nS}$.\n\nWe can now compute the current values.\n- **Baseline Current:** The driving force is $+22.6\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, indicating outward current.\n$$I_{\\mathrm{baseline}} = g_{\\mathrm{out}} \\times (V_m - E_{\\mathrm{K, baseline}}) = (1\\,\\mathrm{nS}) \\times (22.6\\,\\mathrm{mV}) = 22.6\\,\\mathrm{pA}$$\n- **Burst Current:** The driving force is $-9.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, indicating inward current.\n$$I_{\\mathrm{burst}} = g_{\\mathrm{in}} \\times (V_m - E_{\\mathrm{K, burst}}) = (5\\,\\mathrm{nS}) \\times (-9.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}) = -47.5\\,\\mathrm{pA}$$\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. In the linearized regime for a potassium-selective pore, the current can be written as $I_{\\mathrm{Kir}} = g_{\\mathrm{Kir}}\\,(V_m - E_{\\mathrm{K}})$, where $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ is given by the Nernst equation and $g_{\\mathrm{Kir}}$ is the chord conductance around the operating point. With $V_m = -80\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o$ rising from $3\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ to $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ shifts $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ positive so that $V_m - E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ switches from positive to negative, implying a switch from outward to inward current and thereby favoring net $\\mathrm{K}^+$ uptake.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with our derivations. The current formula is correct. The rise in $[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o$ shifts $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ from approximately $-102.6\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ to $-70.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, which is a positive shift. The driving force $(V_m - E_{\\mathrm{K}})$ switches from positive ($+22.6\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) to negative ($-9.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$). This causes the current to switch from outward to inward, which constitutes $\\mathrm{K}^+$ uptake by the astrocyte.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Inward rectification occurs because the Kir pore becomes less blocked as the membrane depolarizes, so $g_{\\mathrm{Kir}}$ increases with depolarization and enhances outward $\\mathrm{K}^+$ current when $V_m  E_{\\mathrm{K}}$, opposing extracellular $\\mathrm{K}^+$ clearance during bursts.**\nThis statement incorrectly describes the mechanism of inward rectification. Block by intracellular cations (polyamines, $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$) occurs when there is an outward driving force ($V_m > E_{\\mathrm{K}}$), which corresponds to relative depolarization. The electrical field drives these positive blockers into the pore from the inside, *increasing* the block and *decreasing* the conductance for outward currents. Thus, $g_{\\mathrm{Kir}}$ *decreases* with depolarization above $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$, suppressing outward current. The statement claims the opposite.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The inward rectification of Kir channels arises from voltage-dependent block by intracellular polyamines and $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ that preferentially suppresses outward currents when $V_m  E_{\\mathrm{K}}$, thereby minimizing $\\mathrm{K}^+$ efflux during depolarization and promoting $\\mathrm{K}^+$ uptake when $[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o$ is elevated.**\nThis provides a correct account of the mechanism and its physiological consequence. The block by intracellular cations indeed suppresses outward currents, which occur when $V_m > E_{\\mathrm{K}}$. This suppression minimizes the loss of $\\mathrm{K}^+$ from the astrocyte, helping it maintain a high intracellular concentration and a negative membrane potential. This steep electrochemical gradient is then available to drive rapid $\\mathrm{K}^+$ influx (uptake) when neuronal activity raises $[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o$ and reverses the driving force ($V_m  E_{\\mathrm{K}}$), a condition where the channel is unblocked and has high conductance.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Because increasing $[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o$ makes $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ more negative, the driving force $V_m - E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ becomes more negative during bursts, which increases inward current and thus promotes $\\mathrm{K}^+$ uptake.**\nThe premise is false. As shown by the Nernst equation, $E_{\\mathrm{K}} = (RT/F) \\ln([\\mathrm{K}^+]_o / [\\mathrm{K}^+]_i)$, $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ is a logarithmic function of the ratio $[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o / [\\mathrm{K}^+]_i$. Increasing $[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o$ increases this ratio, and since $\\ln(x)$ is an increasing function, $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ becomes *more positive* (less negative). Our calculation confirms this: $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ changed from $-102.6\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ to $-70.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Using $g_{\\mathrm{in}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{nS}$ and $g_{\\mathrm{out}} = 0.2\\,g_{\\mathrm{in}}$, the approximate Kir current at baseline ($[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o = 3\\,\\mathrm{mM}$) is small and outward, $I \\approx +23\\,\\mathrm{pA}$, while during the burst ($[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o = 10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$) it becomes larger and inward, $I \\approx -48\\,\\mathrm{pA}$, consistent with preferential $\\mathrm{K}^+$ uptake in elevated $[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o$.**\nThis statement requires verification of the numerical calculations.\n- Baseline: Driving force $= +22.6\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ (outward). Conductance $g_{\\mathrm{out}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{nS}$. Current $I = (1\\,\\mathrm{nS}) \\times (22.6\\,\\mathrm{mV}) = +22.6\\,\\mathrm{pA}$. This is correctly approximated as $I \\approx +23\\,\\mathrm{pA}$.\n- Burst: Driving force $= -9.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ (inward). Conductance $g_{\\mathrm{in}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{nS}$. Current $I = (5\\,\\mathrm{nS}) \\times (-9.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}) = -47.5\\,\\mathrm{pA}$. This is correctly approximated as $I \\approx -48\\,\\mathrm{pA}$.\nThe description of a small outward current switching to a larger inward current is accurate, as is the conclusion that this represents $\\mathrm{K}^+$ uptake. The magnitudes $|-47.5\\,\\mathrm{pA}|$ is more than twice $|+22.6\\,\\mathrm{pA}|$, which is significant.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "2571111"}, {"introduction": "Beyond ion homeostasis, astrocytes are essential for sculpting synaptic transmission by rapidly clearing neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft.

We are given $V_{\\max}=2\\,\\mathrm{mM/s}$, $K_m=30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, and concentrations in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. We convert $V_{\\max}$ to $\\mu\\mathrm{M/s}$:\n$$ V_{\\max} = 2\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mM}}{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\frac{1000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{1\\,\\mathrm{mM}} = 2000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/s} $$\n\n**Part 1: Instantaneous Uptake Rate**\nThe first task is to calculate the instantaneous uptake rate, $V_{uptake}$, at a concentration of $[\\mathrm{Glu}]=100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. We substitute the given values into the rate expression:\n$$ V_{uptake} = V_{\\max} \\frac{[\\mathrm{Glu}]}{K_m + [\\mathrm{Glu}]} = (2000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/s}) \\frac{100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} + 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} $$\n$$ V_{uptake} = 2000 \\frac{100}{130} \\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/s} = \\frac{20000}{13} \\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/s} \\approx 1538.46\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/s} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the uptake rate is $1540\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/s}$, which is more clearly written in scientific notation as $1.54 \\times 10^3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/s}$.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation and Calculation of Time for Concentration Change**\nThe second task is to find the time $T$ required for the concentration to fall from an initial value $[\\mathrm{Glu}]_0 = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ to a final value $[\\mathrm{Glu}]_f = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. This requires integrating the differential equation. We separate variables:\n$$ dt = -\\frac{K_m + [\\mathrm{Glu}]}{V_{\\max}[\\mathrm{Glu}]} d[\\mathrm{Glu}] $$\nWe simplify the expression on the right-hand side:\n$$ dt = -\\frac{1}{V_{\\max}} \\left( \\frac{K_m}{[\\mathrm{Glu}]} + 1 \\right) d[\\mathrm{Glu}] $$\nNow, we integrate both sides. Time runs from $t=0$ to $t=T$, and concentration runs from $[\\mathrm{Glu}]_0$ to $[\\mathrm{Glu}]_f$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{T} dt = -\\frac{1}{V_{\\max}} \\int_{[\\mathrm{Glu}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{Glu}]_f} \\left( \\frac{K_m}{[\\mathrm{Glu}]} + 1 \\right) d[\\mathrm{Glu}] $$\n$$ T = -\\frac{1}{V_{\\max}} \\left[ K_m \\ln|[\\mathrm{Glu}]| + [\\mathrm{Glu}] \\right]_{[\\mathrm{Glu}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{Glu}]_f} $$\nApplying the limits of integration:\n$$ T = -\\frac{1}{V_{\\max}} \\left( (K_m \\ln([\\mathrm{Glu}]_f) + [\\mathrm{Glu}]_f) - (K_m \\ln([\\mathrm{Glu}]_0) + [\\mathrm{Glu}]_0) \\right) $$\nRearranging the terms yields the final analytical expression for the time $T$:\n$$ T = \\frac{1}{V_{\\max}} \\left( K_m \\ln([\\mathrm{Glu}]_0) - K_m \\ln([\\mathrm{Glu}]_f) + [\\mathrm{Glu}]_0 - [\\mathrm{Glu}]_f \\right) $$\n$$ T = \\frac{1}{V_{\\max}} \\left( ([\\mathrm{Glu}]_0 - [\\mathrm{Glu}]_f) + K_m \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{Glu}]_0}{[\\mathrm{Glu}]_f}\\right) \\right) $$\nThis is the derived expression for the time required.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the given values:\n- $V_{\\max} = 2000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/s}$\n- $K_m = 30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $[\\mathrm{Glu}]_0 = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $[\\mathrm{Glu}]_f = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\n$$ T = \\frac{1}{2000} \\left( (100 - 10) + 30 \\ln\\left(\\frac{100}{10}\\right) \\right) $$\nThe units of the terms inside the parenthesis are $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. The overall unit for $T$ will be $\\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{\\mu\\mathrm{M/s}} = \\mathrm{s}$.\n$$ T = \\frac{1}{2000} \\left( 90 + 30 \\ln(10) \\right) \\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nUsing the value $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$:\n$$ T \\approx \\frac{1}{2000} (90 + 30 \\times 2.302585) \\,\\mathrm{s} $$\n$$ T \\approx \\frac{1}{2000} (90 + 69.07755) \\,\\mathrm{s} $$\n$$ T \\approx \\frac{159.07755}{2000} \\,\\mathrm{s} \\approx 0.079538775 \\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nThe problem requires the time in milliseconds ($\\mathrm{ms}$). We convert from seconds to milliseconds:\n$$ T \\approx 0.079538775 \\,\\mathrm{s} \\times 1000 \\,\\frac{\\mathrm{ms}}{\\mathrm{s}} = 79.538775 \\,\\mathrm{ms} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the time is $79.5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nFinal answers for the two parts are summarized.\n1.
