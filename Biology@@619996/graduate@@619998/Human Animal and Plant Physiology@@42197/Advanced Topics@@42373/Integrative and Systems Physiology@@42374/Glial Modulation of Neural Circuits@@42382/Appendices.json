This state of electrochemical equilibrium is achieved when the electrochemical potential of the ion is equal on both sides of the membrane. The electrochemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}_{j}$, for an ionic species $j$ is the sum of its chemical potential and its electrical potential energy per mole.

The resting membrane potential of a neuron is primarily determined by the high permeability of the membrane to potassium ions, mediated by potassium leak channels.

The increase in extracellular potassium concentration, $[K^{+}]_{o}$, from $3\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ to $8\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ reduces the magnitude of the concentration gradient pushing $K^{+}$ out of the cell.

This positive change, $\\Delta E_{K} = +26.2\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, indicates a depolarization. Since the resting membrane potential closely follows $E_{K}$, the neuron's resting potential will also depolarize, bringing it closer to the threshold for firing an action potential and thus increasing its excitability.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{26.2}$$", "id": "2571266"}, {"introduction": "The efficiency of astrocytic potassium buffering is endowed by the specialized biophysical properties of inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels.

Then, using the Nernst equation, compute the sign of the current before and during the burst. Finally, consider that Kir channels exhibit inward rectification due to voltage-dependent pore block by intracellular $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ and polyamines, which suppresses outward currents more than inward currents.

Inward rectification occurs because the Kir pore becomes less blocked as the membrane depolarizes, so $g_{\\mathrm{Kir}}$ increases with depolarization and enhances outward $\\mathrm{K}^+$ current when $V_m > E_{\\mathrm{K}}$, opposing extracellular $\\mathrm{K}^+$ clearance during bursts.\n\nC.

It is valid. The solution will proceed.\n\n---\n\n**Derivation and Calculation**\n\nFirst, we address the derivation requested in the problem statement. The net movement of an ion across a membrane is driven by the electrochemical potential difference. For a potassium-selective channel, the membrane potential at which there is no net current is the Nernst equilibrium potential for potassium, $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$. It is given by the Nernst equation:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{K}} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o}{[\\mathrm{K}^+]_i}\\right)$$\nFor a monovalent cation like $\\mathrm{K}^+$, the valence $z$ is $+1$. Thus:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{K}} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o}{[\\mathrm{K}^+]_i}\\right)$$\n\nThe problem states that the current-voltage relation can be linearized. This is an application of Ohm's law to ion channels. The net \"voltage\" driving the current of a specific ion is not the membrane potential $V_m$ itself, but the difference between $V_m$ and the ion's equilibrium potential, $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$. This difference, $(V_m - E_{\\mathrm{K}})$, is termed the electrochemical driving force. The current, $I_{\\mathrm{K}}$, is proportional to this driving force, where the constant of proportionality is the conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{K}}$.\n$$I_{\\mathrm{K}} = g_{\\mathrm{K}}\\,(V_m - E_{\\mathrm{K}})$$\nThis is the required expression. By convention, outward current (positive ion efflux) is positive, and inward current (positive ion influx) is negative.\n\nNext, we calculate $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ under the two specified conditions.\nThe intracellular potassium concentration is constant: $[\\mathrm{K}^+]_i = 140\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\nThe factor $RT/F$ is given as $26.7\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\n**1. Baseline Condition (before the burst):**\n$[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o = 3\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{K, baseline}} = (26.7\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{140}\\right) \\approx (26.7\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\times (-3.844) \\approx -102.6\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\nThe driving force is $V_m - E_{\\mathrm{K, baseline}} = -80\\,\\mathrm{mV} - (-102.6\\,\\mathrm{mV}) = +22.6\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\nSince the driving force is positive, the current is outward.\n\n**2. Burst Condition:**\n$[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o$ rises to $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{K, burst}} = (26.7\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{10}{140}\\right) \\approx (26.7\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\times (-2.639) \\approx -70.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\nThe driving force is $V_m - E_{\\mathrm{K, burst}} = -80\\,\\mathrm{mV} - (-70.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}) = -9.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\nSince the driving force is negative, the current is inward.\n\nThe rise in $[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o$ shifts $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ to a more positive value and reverses the direction of the $\\mathrm{K}^+$ current from outward to inward.\n\nFinally, we consider inward rectification. The conductance is not constant but depends on the direction of current.\n- For outward current ($V_m > E_{\\mathrm{K}}$), we use $g_{\\mathrm{out}} = 0.2\\,g_{\\mathrm{in}} = 0.2 \\times (5\\,\\mathrm{nS}) = 1\\,\\mathrm{nS}$.\n- For inward current ($V_m  E_{\\mathrm{K}}$), we use $g_{\\mathrm{in}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{nS}$.\n\nWe can now compute the current values.\n- **Baseline Current:** The driving force is $+22.6\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, indicating outward current.\n$$I_{\\mathrm{baseline}} = g_{\\mathrm{out}} \\times (V_m - E_{\\mathrm{K, baseline}}) = (1\\,\\mathrm{nS}) \\times (22.6\\,\\mathrm{mV}) = 22.6\\,\\mathrm{pA}$$\n- **Burst Current:** The driving force is $-9.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, indicating inward current.\n$$I_{\\mathrm{burst}} = g_{\\mathrm{in}} \\times (V_m - E_{\\mathrm{K, burst}}) = (5\\,\\mathrm{nS}) \\times (-9.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}) = -47.5\\,\\mathrm{pA}$$\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. In the linearized regime for a potassium-selective pore, the current can be written as $I_{\\mathrm{Kir}} = g_{\\mathrm{Kir}}\\,(V_m - E_{\\mathrm{K}})$, where $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ is given by the Nernst equation and $g_{\\mathrm{Kir}}$ is the chord conductance around the operating point. With $V_m = -80\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o$ rising from $3\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ to $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ shifts $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ positive so that $V_m - E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ switches from positive to negative, implying a switch from outward to inward current and thereby favoring net $\\mathrm{K}^+$ uptake.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with our derivations. The current formula is correct. The rise in $[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o$ shifts $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ from approximately $-102.6\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ to $-70.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, which is a positive shift. The driving force $(V_m - E_{\\mathrm{K}})$ switches from positive ($+22.6\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) to negative ($-9.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$). This causes the current to switch from outward to inward, which constitutes $\\mathrm{K}^+$ uptake by the astrocyte.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Inward rectification occurs because the Kir pore becomes less blocked as the membrane depolarizes, so $g_{\\mathrm{Kir}}$ increases with depolarization and enhances outward $\\mathrm{K}^+$ current when $V_m  E_{\\mathrm{K}}$, opposing extracellular $\\mathrm{K}^+$ clearance during bursts.**\nThis statement incorrectly describes the mechanism of inward rectification. Block by intracellular cations (polyamines, $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$) occurs when there is an outward driving force ($V_m > E_{\\mathrm{K}}$), which corresponds to relative depolarization. The electrical field drives these positive blockers into the pore from the inside, *increasing* the block and *decreasing* the conductance for outward currents. Thus, $g_{\\mathrm{Kir}}$ *decreases* with depolarization above $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$, suppressing outward current. The statement claims the opposite.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The inward rectification of Kir channels arises from voltage-dependent block by intracellular polyamines and $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ that preferentially suppresses outward currents when $V_m  E_{\\mathrm{K}}$, thereby minimizing $\\mathrm{K}^+$ efflux during depolarization and promoting $\\mathrm{K}^+$ uptake when $[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o$ is elevated.**\nThis provides a correct account of the mechanism and its physiological consequence. The block by intracellular cations indeed suppresses outward currents, which occur when $V_m > E_{\\mathrm{K}}$. This suppression minimizes the loss of $\\mathrm{K}^+$ from the astrocyte, helping it maintain a high intracellular concentration and a negative membrane potential. This steep electrochemical gradient is then available to drive rapid $\\mathrm{K}^+$ influx (uptake) when neuronal activity raises $[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o$ and reverses the driving force ($V_m  E_{\\mathrm{K}}$), a condition where the channel is unblocked and has high conductance.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Because increasing $[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o$ makes $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ more negative, the driving force $V_m - E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ becomes more negative during bursts, which increases inward current and thus promotes $\\mathrm{K}^+$ uptake.**\nThe premise is false. As shown by the Nernst equation, $E_{\\mathrm{K}} = (RT/F) \\ln([\\mathrm{K}^+]_o / [\\mathrm{K}^+]_i)$, $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ is a logarithmic function of the ratio $[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o / [\\mathrm{K}^+]_i$. Increasing $[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o$ increases this ratio, and since $\\ln(x)$ is an increasing function, $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ becomes *more positive* (less negative). Our calculation confirms this: $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ changed from $-102.6\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ to $-70.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Using $g_{\\mathrm{in}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{nS}$ and $g_{\\mathrm{out}} = 0.2\\,g_{\\mathrm{in}}$, the approximate Kir current at baseline ($[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o = 3\\,\\mathrm{mM}$) is small and outward, $I \\approx +23\\,\\mathrm{pA}$, while during the burst ($[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o = 10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$) it becomes larger and inward, $I \\approx -48\\,\\mathrm{pA}$, consistent with preferential $\\mathrm{K}^+$ uptake in elevated $[\\mathrm{K}^+]_o$.**\nThis statement requires verification of the numerical calculations.\n- Baseline: Driving force $= +22.6\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ (outward). Conductance $g_{\\mathrm{out}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{nS}$. Current $I = (1\\,\\mathrm{nS}) \\times (22.6\\,\\mathrm{mV}) = +22.6\\,\\mathrm{pA}$. This is correctly approximated as $I \\approx +23\\,\\mathrm{pA}$.\n- Burst: Driving force $= -9.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ (inward). Conductance $g_{\\mathrm{in}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{nS}$. Current $I = (5\\,\\mathrm{nS}) \\times (-9.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}) = -47.5\\,\\mathrm{pA}$. This is correctly approximated as $I \\approx -48\\,\\mathrm{pA}$.\nThe description of a small outward current switching to a larger inward current is accurate, as is the conclusion that this represents $\\mathrm{K}^+$ uptake. The magnitudes $|-47.5\\,\\mathrm{pA}|$ is more than twice $|+22.6\\,\\mathrm{pA}|$, which is significant.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "2571111"}, {"introduction": "Beyond ion homeostasis, astrocytes are essential for sculpting synaptic transmission by rapidly clearing neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft.

We convert $V_{\\max}$ to $\\mu\\mathrm{M/s}$:\n$$ V_{\\max} = 2\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mM}}{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\frac{1000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{1\\,\\mathrm{mM}} = 2000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/s} $$\n\n**Part 1: Instantaneous Uptake Rate**\nThe first task is to calculate the instantaneous uptake rate, $V_{uptake}$, at a concentration of $[\\mathrm{Glu}]=100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. We substitute the given values into the rate expression:\n$$ V_{uptake} = V_{\\max} \\frac{[\\mathrm{Glu}]}{K_m + [\\mathrm{Glu}]} = (2000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/s}) \\frac{100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} + 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} $$\n$$ V_{uptake} = 2000 \\frac{100}{130} \\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/s} = \\frac{20000}{13} \\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/s} \\approx 1538.46\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/s} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the uptake rate is $1540\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/s}$, which is more clearly written in scientific notation as $1.54 \\times 10^3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/s}$.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation and Calculation of Time for Concentration Change**\nThe second task is to find the time $T$ required for the concentration to fall from an initial value $[\\mathrm{Glu}]_0 = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ to a final value $[\\mathrm{Glu}]_f = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. This requires integrating the differential equation. We separate variables:\n$$ dt = -\\frac{K_m + [\\mathrm{Glu}]}{V_{\\max}[\\mathrm{Glu}]} d[\\mathrm{Glu}] $$\nWe simplify the expression on the right-hand side:\n$$ dt = -\\frac{1}{V_{\\max}} \\left( \\frac{K_m}{[\\mathrm{Glu}]} + 1 \\right) d[\\mathrm{Glu}] $$\nNow, we integrate both sides. Time runs from $t=0$ to $t=T$, and concentration runs from $[\\mathrm{Glu}]_0$ to $[\\mathrm{Glu}]_f$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{T} dt = -\\frac{1}{V_{\\max}} \\int_{[\\mathrm{Glu}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{Glu}]_f} \\left( \\frac{K_m}{[\\mathrm{Glu}]} + 1 \\right) d[\\mathrm{Glu}] $$\n$$ T = -\\frac{1}{V_{\\max}} \\left[ K_m \\ln|[\\mathrm{Glu}]| + [\\mathrm{Glu}] \\right]_{[\\mathrm{Glu}]_0}^{[\\mathrm{Glu}]_f} $$\nApplying the limits of integration:\n$$ T = -\\frac{1}{V_{\\max}} \\left( (K_m \\ln([\\mathrm{Glu}]_f) + [\\mathrm{Glu}]_f) - (K_m \\ln([\\mathrm{Glu}]_0) + [\\mathrm{Glu}]_0) \\right) $$\nRearranging the terms yields the final analytical expression for the time $T$:\n$$ T = \\frac{1}{V_{\\max}} \\left( K_m \\ln([\\mathrm{Glu}]_0) - K_m \\ln([\\mathrm{Glu}]_f) + [\\mathrm{Glu}]_0 - [\\mathrm{Glu}]_f \\right) $$\n$$ T = \\frac{1}{V_{\\max}} \\left( ([\\mathrm{Glu}]_0 - [\\mathrm{Glu}]_f) + K_m \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{Glu}]_0}{[\\mathrm{Glu}]_f}\\right) \\right) $$\nThis is the derived expression for the time required.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the given values:\n- $V_{\\max} = 2000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/s}$\n- $K_m = 30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $[\\mathrm{Glu}]_0 = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $[\\mathrm{Glu}]_f = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\n$$ T = \\frac{1}{2000} \\left( (100 - 10) + 30 \\ln\\left(\\frac{100}{10}\\right) \\right) $$\nThe units of the terms inside the parenthesis are $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. The overall unit for $T$ will be $\\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{\\mu\\mathrm{M/s}} = \\mathrm{s}$.\n$$ T = \\frac{1}{2000} \\left( 90 + 30 \\ln(10) \\right) \\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nUsing the value $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$:\n$$ T \\approx \\frac{1}{2000} (90 + 30 \\times 2.302585) \\,\\mathrm{s} $$\n$$ T \\approx \\frac{1}{2000} (90 + 69.07755) \\,\\mathrm{s} $$\n$$ T \\approx \\frac{159.07755}{2000} \\,\\mathrm{s} \\approx 0.079538775 \\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nThe problem requires the time in milliseconds ($\\mathrm{ms}$). We convert from seconds to milliseconds:\n$$ T \\approx 0.079538775 \\,\\mathrm{s} \\times 1000 \\,\\frac{\\mathrm{ms}}{\\mathrm{s}} = 79.538775 \\,\\mathrm{ms} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the time is $79.5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nFinal answers for the two parts are summarized.\n1.
