The language is objective and precise. The problem is formalizable and solvable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived based on the principle of conservation of mass.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first determining the total molar flux of carbon available for short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) synthesis and then partitioning this flux to the individual SCFAs based on the given stoichiometric ratios.\n\nFirst, we calculate the mass of fiber fermented in the colon per day, denoted as $m_{ferm}$. This is the fraction of the total daily intake, $I_{fiber}$, that reaches the colon and is subsequently fermented.\n$$ m_{ferm} = I_{fiber} \\times f_{colon} \\times f_{ferm} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ m_{ferm} = 40~\\mathrm{g\\,day^{-1}} \\times 0.90 \\times 0.80 = 28.8~\\mathrm{g\\,day^{-1}} $$\n\nNext, we convert this mass of fermented fiber into a molar rate of anhydrohexose units, $\\dot{n}_{hex}$, using the molar mass $M_{hex} = 162~\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n$$ \\dot{n}_{hex} = \\frac{m_{ferm}}{M_{hex}} = \\frac{28.8~\\mathrm{g\\,day^{-1}}}{162~\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}} \\approx 0.1777...~\\mathrm{mol\\,day^{-1}} $$\n\nThe molar rate of carbon atoms entering fermentation, $\\dot{C}_{total}$, is found by multiplying the molar rate of anhydrohexose units by the number of carbon atoms per unit, $N_{C,hex} = 6$.\n$$ \\dot{C}_{total} = \\dot{n}_{hex} \\times N_{C,hex} = \\frac{28.8}{162}~\\mathrm{mol\\,day^{-1}} \\times 6 = \\frac{172.8}{162}~\\mathrm{mol\\,C\\,day^{-1}} \\approx 1.0666...~\\mathrm{mol\\,C\\,day^{-1}} $$\n\nThis total carbon flux is partitioned. A fraction $f_{CUE} = 0.15$ is incorporated into microbial biomass. The remaining fraction, $(1 - f_{CUE})$, becomes metabolic products. The molar rate of carbon in these products, $\\dot{C}_{prod}$, is:\n$$ \\dot{C}_{prod} = \\dot{C}_{total} \\times (1 - f_{CUE}) = 1.0666...~\\mathrm{mol\\,C\\,day^{-1}} \\times (1 - 0.15) = 1.0666...~\\mathrm{mol\\,C\\,day^{-1}} \\times 0.85 \\approx 0.90666...~\\mathrm{mol\\,C\\,day^{-1}} $$\n\nFrom this product carbon, a fraction $f_{gas} = 0.10$ is lost as gas.
