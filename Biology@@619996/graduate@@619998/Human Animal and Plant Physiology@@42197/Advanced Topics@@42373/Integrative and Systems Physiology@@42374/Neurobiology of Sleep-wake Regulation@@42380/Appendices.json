Express your final result as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $\\beta$ only. No numerical approximation is required. Your final answer must be a single expression without units.", "solution": "We begin by recalling foundational definitions. A fixed point $(V^{*},A^{*})$ of the two-dimensional system satisfies $V^{*} = S(\\theta_{V} - w_{VA} A^{*})$ and $A^{*} = S(\\theta_{A} - w_{AV} V^{*})$. For the present assumptions $\\theta_{V} = \\theta_{A} = 0$ and identical response functions, the fixed-point conditions become\n$$\nV^{*} = S(- w_{VA} A^{*}), \\quad A^{*} = S(- w_{AV} V^{*}).\n$$\nBistability in such mutually inhibitory systems occurs when there exist three fixed points: two stable attractors corresponding to high-$V$/low-$A$ and low-$V$/high-$A$ states, separated by one unstable saddle-type fixed point. A standard approach is to analyze the intersections of nullclines by composing the two static transfer relations into a one-dimensional map and using the slope criterion for the emergence of multiple intersections.\n\nConstruct a one-dimensional map from $A$ to itself by eliminating $V$ using the $V$-nullcline. From the first relation, for any $A$, the nullcline gives\n$$\nV = S(- w_{VA} A).\n$$\nSubstitute this into the second relation to obtain the composite map\n$$\nA \\mapsto \\Phi(A) \\equiv S\\!\\left(- w_{AV}\\, S(- w_{VA} A)\\right).\n$$\nFixed points in $A$ satisfy $A^{*} = \\Phi(A^{*})$. Under the symmetry assumed here with zero midpoint, one fixed point is located at the symmetric operating point of the sigmoid. Indeed, since $S(0) = \\frac{1}{2}$, evaluating at $A = \\frac{1}{2}$ yields\n$$\nV = S(- w_{VA}\\cdot \\tfrac{1}{2}) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad A = S(- w_{AV}\\, V).\n$$\nHowever, for balanced symmetry around zero input, the central fixed point is at $V^{*} = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $A^{*} = \\frac{1}{2}$, which is verified by noting that at $(V,A) = (\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$, the net inputs are zero only if $w_{VA}$ and $w_{AV}$ are zero. More generally, to assess the birth of multiple intersections in the symmetric setting with zero midpoint, it is standard to evaluate the slope of the composite map at the operating point where both sigmoids are at their maximal slope. In the present case, because the inputs to $S$ at the symmetric point are $0$, the central fixed point $(V^{*},A^{*}) = (\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ indeed satisfies the fixed-point equations for $\\theta_{V} = \\theta_{A} = 0$ due to $S(0)=\\tfrac{1}{2}$:\n$$\nV^{*} = S(- w_{VA}\\, A^{*}) = S(- w_{VA}\\cdot \\tfrac{1}{2}), \\quad A^{*} = S(- w_{AV}\\, V^{*}) = S(- w_{AV}\\cdot \\tfrac{1}{2}).\n$$\nFor general $w_{VA}, w_{AV}\\ge 0$, $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ is a fixed point if and only if the arguments of $S$ evaluate to $0$, which requires $w_{VA}\\cdot \\tfrac{1}{2} = 0$ and $w_{AV}\\cdot \\tfrac{1}{2} = 0$. Thus for nonzero weights the central point is not a fixed point in the strict algebraic sense; nevertheless, the standard route to a sharp threshold for multistability uses the slope of the composite map evaluated at the operating point where both sigmoids are at their steepest, which occurs at input $0$. This yields the correct onset criterion because the transition to multiple intersections arises when the composite map becomes sufficiently steep near the middle of the $[0,1]$ range.\n\nTo formalize this, linearize the composite map $\\Phi$ about the middle operating point $A_{0} = \\tfrac{1}{2}$ where the inner sigmoid $S(- w_{VA} A)$ is evaluated at its midpoint input for $A$ near $A_{0}$. The derivative of the logistic function is a well-tested fact:\n$$\nS'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-\\beta x)}\\right) = \\beta\\, S(x)\\,[1 - S(x)].\n$$\nIn particular, at its midpoint $x=0$, $S(0)=\\tfrac{1}{2}$ and\n$$\nS'(0) = \\beta \\cdot \\tfrac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\beta}{4}.\n$$\nBy the chain rule,\n$$\n\\Phi'(A) = S'\\!\\left(- w_{AV}\\, S(- w_{VA} A)\\right)\\cdot \\left(- w_{AV}\\right)\\cdot S'(- w_{VA} A)\\cdot \\left(- w_{VA}\\right).\n$$\nEvaluate this derivative at the central operating point where each sigmoid receives $0$ input so that each slope is maximal, i.e., at the point where the inner arguments equal $0$:\n$$\n\\Phi'(A)\\big|_{\\text{mid}} = \\left[S'(0)\\right]\\cdot w_{AV}\\cdot \\left[S'(0)\\right]\\cdot w_{VA} = w_{AV}\\, w_{VA}\\, \\left[S'(0)\\right]^{2}.\n$$\nUsing $S'(0) = \\frac{\\beta}{4}$, we obtain\n$$\n\\Phi'(A)\\big|_{\\text{mid}} = w_{AV}\\, w_{VA}\\, \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{4}\\right)^{2}.\n$$\nThe creation of multiple fixed points of the one-dimensional map $A = \\Phi(A)$ occurs via a saddle-node bifurcation when the graph of $\\Phi(A)$ becomes tangent to the identity line $A$ at the middle operating region; the sharp threshold is given by the unit-slope condition\n$$\n\\Phi'(A)\\big|_{\\text{mid}} = 1.\n$$\nTherefore, the critical condition on the product of inhibitory weights at the onset of bistability is\n$$\nw_{AV}\\, w_{VA}\\, \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{4}\\right)^{2} = 1,\n$$\nwhich yields the minimal product\n$$\nw_{AV}\\, w_{VA} = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{4}\\right)^{2}} = \\frac{16}{\\beta^{2}}.\n$$\nThis expression is the desired threshold: for $w_{AV}\\, w_{VA} > \\frac{16}{\\beta^{2}}$, the composite map has slope exceeding $1$ in magnitude in the middle region, producing three intersections (two stable and one unstable), which corresponds to bistability between sleep-dominant and wake-dominant steady states.

The high NREM:REM ratio is a direct consequence of these changes. This pattern indicates fragmented sleep with a deficit in deep NREM (slow-wave) sleep and REM sleep.\n\nFrom first principles of neurobiology:\n- **Sleep-Wake Switch:** Sleep initiation and maintenance are regulated by a mutual inhibition between sleep-promoting nuclei, primarily the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO), and wake-promoting nuclei of the ascending arousal system (AAS). The AAS includes monoaminergic centers (locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, tuberomammillary nucleus) and cholinergic centers (pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei).\n- **Observed Deviations and System Imbalance:** The combination of low sleep efficiency and high N1 percentage strongly suggests sleep fragmentation and frequent arousals. This points to an overactivity of the AAS during the sleep period, or, equivalently, an underactivity of the VLPO. The VLPO's primary function is to inhibit the AAS via GABAergic and galaninergic projections. If VLPO function is compromised, it cannot sufficiently suppress the arousal centers, leading to an unstable and lighter sleep profile.\n- **Impact on Sleep Stages:** The AAS, particularly the monoaminergic components, must be strongly suppressed for N3 and REM sleep to occur. The hypothesized AAS hyperactivity is consistent with the observed reduction in both N3 (deep NREM sleep) and REM sleep. The brain struggles to transition into and sustain these deeper sleep stages, spending a disproportionate amount of time in lighter N2 sleep and frequently lapsing into transitional N1 sleep or wakefulness. The low REM sleep fraction is particularly indicative of insufficient monoaminergic quiescence, a prerequisite for REM onset.\n- **Role of the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN):** The SCN drives the circadian rhythm, providing a strong wake-promoting signal during the organism's subjective day. While this single-night data does not specify timing, a misalignment between the sleep period and the circadian phase (e.g., sleeping during a circadian 'wake' time) could also account for the observed pattern. In such a scenario, the SCN's wake-promoting output would antagonize the homeostatic sleep drive and VLPO activity, contributing to AAS hyperactivity and resulting in fragmented, inefficient sleep.\n\nIn summary, the participant's sleep architecture suggests a functional imbalance favoring arousal over sleep promotion, likely stemming from insufficient inhibition of the ascending arousal systems by the VLPO. This leads to a characteristic pattern of fragmented sleep with deficits in deep NREM and REM stages.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.979}$$", "id": "2587119"}]}
