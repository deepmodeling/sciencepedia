Derivation of the space constant $\\lambda$.\nThe space constant $\\lambda$ is defined from the steady-state ($d/dt = 0$) voltage profile under a sustained current injection at a single cell, $i=0$. Therefore, $I_{inj,i} = I_0 \\delta_{i,0}$. For all other cells ($i \\neq 0$), the equation is homogeneous:\n$$(g_m + 2g_j) V_i - g_j(V_{i-1} + V_{i+1}) = 0$$\nDividing by $g_j$ yields a standard second-order linear difference equation:\n$$V_{i+1} - \\left(2 + \\frac{g_m}{g_j}\\right) V_i + V_{i-1} = 0$$\nThe problem specifies that $\\lambda$ is the characteristic length of exponential spatial decay. We seek a solution of the form $V_i \\propto \\exp(-|x_i|/\\lambda)$, where $x_i = ia$ is the position of cell $i$.

Since $g_m, g_j > 0$, the term $1 + \\frac{g_m}{2g_j}$ is greater than $1$. Thus, one root is greater than $1$ and the other is less than $1$. For a decaying solution as $|i| \\to \\infty$, we must choose the root with magnitude less than $1$:\n$$\\beta = 1 + \\frac{g_m}{2g_j} - \\sqrt{\\left(1 + \\frac{g_m}{2g_j}\\right)^2 - 1}$$\nWe relate this $\\beta$ back to $\\lambda$ using $\\beta = \\exp(-a/\\lambda)$, which implies $\\ln(\\beta) = -a/\\lambda$.\nA useful identity is $\\ln(y - \\sqrt{y^2-1}) = -\\arccosh(y)$ for $y \\ge 1$.

To find $\\gamma_{min}$, we must minimize $\\gamma_k$ with respect to the wavenumber $k$. The term $(1 - \\cos(ka))$ is always non-negative. Its minimum value is $0$, which occurs when $ka = 2n\\pi$ for any integer $n$, including $k=0$.\nThe minimum decay rate is therefore:\n$$\\gamma_{min} = \\gamma_{k=0} = \\frac{g_m}{C_m} + \\frac{2g_j}{C_m}(1 - \\cos(0)) = \\frac{g_m}{C_m}$$\nThe dominant time constant is the reciprocal of this rate:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{min}} = \\frac{C_m}{g_m}$$\nThis result is physically intuitive: the slowest decay mode corresponds to a spatially uniform voltage profile ($k=0$), where there are no potential differences between cells. In this case, the gap junctions carry no current, and the entire network decays as a single isopotential cell with membrane capacitance $C_m$ and leak conductance $g_m$.\n\nThe required pair is $(\\lambda, \\tau)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{a}{\\arccosh\\left(1 + \\frac{g_m}{2g_j}\\right)} & \\frac{C_m}{g_m} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2551319"}, {"introduction": "Ultimately, the significance of bioelectric signaling lies in its ability to guide pattern formation.
