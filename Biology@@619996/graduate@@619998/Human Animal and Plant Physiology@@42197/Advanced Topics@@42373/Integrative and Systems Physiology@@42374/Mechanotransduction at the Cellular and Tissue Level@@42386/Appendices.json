The problem is well-posed, with sufficient information and clear, objective language to permit a unique solution. No scientific flaws, contradictions, or ambiguities are present.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A rigorous derivation and solution will be provided.\n\nThe starting point is the conservation of linear momentum for an incompressible Newtonian fluid. For steady, fully developed, and unidirectional flow in a channel, the Navier-Stokes equations simplify significantly. Let the coordinate system be defined such that the $x$-axis lies along the direction of flow, and the $y$-axis is perpendicular to the channel walls. The bottom wall, where the endothelial cells are located, is at $y=0$, and the top wall is at $y=h$.\n\nGiven the problem statement, we make the following simplifications to the $x$-momentum equation:\n1.  **Steady flow**: All time derivatives are zero ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$).\n2.  **Fully developed flow**: The velocity profile is independent of the downstream coordinate $x$, so $\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} = 0$. From the continuity equation for incompressible flow ($\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y} = 0$), this implies $\\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y}=0$. Since the vertical velocity $u_y$ is zero at the walls, it must be zero everywhere.\n3.  **Plane Poiseuille flow ($w \\gg h$)**: We neglect side-wall effects and treat the flow as two-dimensional, meaning there are no variations in the $z$-direction ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} = 0$).\n4.  **Negligible gravity**: The body force term is ignored.\n\nWith these simplifications, the $x$-component of the Navier-Stokes equation reduces to a balance between the pressure gradient and viscous forces:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{dp}{dx} + \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u_x}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u_x}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u_x}{\\partial z^2} \\right) $$\nSince $u_x$ depends only on $y$, this simplifies further to:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 u_x}{dy^2} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nThe left side is a function of $y$ only, while the right side is a function of $x$ only. This can only be true if both sides are equal to a constant. Thus, the pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dx}$ is constant.\n\nWe integrate this equation twice with respect to $y$:\n$$ \\frac{du_x}{dy} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\left(\\frac{dp}{dx}\\right) y + C_1 $$\n$$ u_x(y) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\left(\\frac{dp}{dx}\\right) y^2 + C_1 y + C_2 $$\nThe constants of integration, $C_1$ and $C_2$, are determined from the no-slip boundary conditions:\n1.  At the bottom wall ($y=0$): $u_x(0) = 0$.\n2.  At the top wall ($y=h$): $u_x(h) = 0$.\n\nApplying the first condition:\n$u_x(0) = 0 \\implies C_2 = 0$.\nApplying the second condition:\n$u_x(h) = 0 \\implies \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\left(\\frac{dp}{dx}\\right) h^2 + C_1 h = 0 \\implies C_1 = -\\frac{h}{2\\mu} \\left(\\frac{dp}{dx}\\right)$.\n\nSubstituting these constants back into the velocity profile equation gives:\n$$ u_x(y) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\left(\\frac{dp}{dx}\\right) y^2 - \\frac{h}{2\\mu} \\left(\\frac{dp}{dx}\\right) y = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (y^2 - hy) $$\nThis is the characteristic parabolic velocity profile for plane Poiseuille flow.\n\nNext, we relate the pressure gradient to the volumetric flow rate $Q$. The flow rate is the integral of the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area $A = w \\times h$:\n$$ Q = \\int_A u_x(y) dA = \\int_0^w \\int_0^h u_x(y) dy dz = w \\int_0^h u_x(y) dy $$\n$$ Q = w \\int_0^h \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (y^2 - hy) dy = \\frac{w}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\left[ \\frac{y^3}{3} - \\frac{hy^2}{2} \\right]_0^h $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{w}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\left( \\frac{h^3}{3} - \\frac{h^3}{2} \\right) = \\frac{w}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\left( -\\frac{h^3}{6} \\right) = -\\frac{wh^3}{12\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nWe can now express the pressure gradient in terms of known parameters:\n$$ \\frac{dp}{dx} = -\\frac{12\\mu Q}{wh^3} $$\n\nThe shear stress for a Newtonian fluid is given by $\\tau_{yx} = \\mu \\frac{du_x}{dy}$. The wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$, experienced by a cell on the bottom wall is this stress evaluated at $y=0$.\nFirst, we find the shear rate, $\\frac{du_x}{dy}$, from the velocity profile:\n$$ \\frac{du_x}{dy} = \\frac{d}{dy} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (y^2 - hy) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (2y - h) $$\nThe wall shear stress at $y=0$ is therefore:\n$$ \\tau_w = \\tau_{yx}|_{y=0} = \\mu \\left( \\frac{du_x}{dy} \\right)_{y=0} = \\mu \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (-h) \\right) = -\\frac{h}{2} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nFinally, substitute the expression for the pressure gradient:\n$$ \\tau_w = -\\frac{h}{2} \\left( -\\frac{12\\mu Q}{wh^3} \\right) = \\frac{6\\mu Q}{wh^2} $$\nThis is the derived analytical expression for the wall shear stress.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value.
