It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We will proceed with the validation and solution.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\nThe given information is as follows:\n- The probability of a specific protein, Yes-associated protein (YAP), localizing to the nucleus, $P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}(E)$, is described as a function of the extracellular matrix (ECM) elastic modulus, $E$.\n- The functional form is a Hill-type equation: $P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}(E) = \\dfrac{E^{n}}{E^{n} + K^{n}}$.\n- The parameter $K$ represents the stiffness at half-maximal activation, given as $K = 5\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$.\n- The parameter $n$ is the Hill coefficient, representing cooperativity, given as $n = 3$.\n- The task is to compute $P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}(E)$ for three specific values of stiffness: $E \\in \\{0.5, 5, 50\\}\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$.\n- A subsequent task is to interpret the results in the context of mechanotransduction regimes.\n\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded, as the Hill function is a standard model for describing sigmoidal, cooperative processes in biology. The context of mechanotransduction and YAP localization is a well-established area of cell biology research. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and variables defined, leading to a unique set of solutions. The language is objective and precise. There are no violations of scientific principles or logical consistency. We proceed to solve the problem.\n\nThe governing equation is $P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}(E) = \\dfrac{E^{n}}{E^{n} + K^{n}}$.\nSubstituting the given parameters $K=5$ and $n=3$, we obtain the specific form of the function:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}(E) = \\frac{E^{3}}{E^{3} + 5^{3}} = \\frac{E^{3}}{E^{3} + 125}$$\nWe are required to evaluate this function for three values of $E$.\n\nCase 1: $E = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$\nWe substitute $E = 0.5$ into the equation:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}(0.5) = \\frac{(0.5)^{3}}{(0.5)^{3} + 125} = \\frac{0.125}{0.125 + 125} = \\frac{0.125}{125.125}$$\nTo express this as an exact fraction, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $1000$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}(0.5) = \\frac{125}{125125} = \\frac{125}{125 \\times 1001} = \\frac{1}{1001}$$\n\nCase 2: $E = 5\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$\nWe substitute $E = 5$ into the equation. This value of $E$ is equal to the parameter $K$.\n$$P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}(5) = \\frac{5^{3}}{5^{3} + 5^{3}} = \\frac{125}{125 + 125} = \\frac{125}{250} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nAs expected from the definition of $K$, the activation probability is exactly one-half when the stimulus $E$ equals the half-maximal activation constant $K$.\n\nCase 3: $E = 50\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$\nWe substitute $E = 50$ into the equation:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}(50) = \\frac{50^{3}}{50^{3} + 125} = \\frac{125000}{125000 + 125} = \\frac{125000}{125125}$$\nTo simplify this fraction, we again factor out $125$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}(50) = \\frac{125 \\times 1000}{125 \\times 1001} = \\frac{1000}{1001}$$\n\nNow, we interpret these results in terms of physiological regimes. The behavior of the Hill function is determined by the ratio of the stimulus $E$ to the characteristic stiffness $K$.\n\nRegime 1: Soft-niche.

The resulting probability $P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}(0.5) = \\frac{1}{1001} \\approx 0.001$. This value is very close to zero, indicating that the YAP mechanotransduction pathway is essentially inactive. In this regime, the system is insensitive to the stimulus.\n\nRegime 2: Transition. This corresponds to $E \\approx K$.\nOur calculation for $E = 5\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$ lies at the center of this regime, where $E = K$. The probability is $P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}(5) = \\frac{1}{2}$. The system is in a state of intermediate activation and exhibits the highest sensitivity to fractional changes in stiffness $E$. Small changes in $E$ around $K$ will produce the largest changes in $P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}$. The Hill coefficient $n=3$ signifies a steep, switch-like transition from the \"off\" state to the \"on\" state centered at $E=K$.\n\nRegime 3: Stiff-niche. This corresponds to $E \\gg K$.\nOur calculation for $E = 50\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$ represents this regime, where $E = 10 \\times K$. The resulting probability is $P_{\\mathrm{YAP}}(50) = \\frac{1000}{1001} \\approx 0.999$. This value is very close to one, indicating that the YAP pathway is saturated or fully activated. In this regime, the system becomes insensitive to further increases in stiffness, as the response is already maximal.\n\nIn summary, the three evaluated points correspond to the three key operational regimes of a sigmoidal response curve: a basal (off) state for $E \\ll K$, a sensitive transition for $E \\approx K$, and a saturated (on) state for $E \\gg K$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{1001} & \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1000}{1001}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2609313"}, {"introduction": "Stem cell populations and their niches are dynamic systems, often governed by intricate feedback loops that ensure tissue homeostasis.

This is achieved by computing the Jacobian matrix $J$ of the vector field $(F, G)$, evaluated at the steady state. The Jacobian matrix is defined as:\n$$ J = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial s} & \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial n} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial s} & \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial n} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe compute the four partial derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial s} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} \\left( r(s - s^2)\\frac{n}{1+n} - ds \\right) = r(1 - 2s)\\frac{n}{1+n} - d $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial n} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n} \\left( r s(1 - s)\\frac{n}{1+n} - ds \\right) = r s(1 - s) \\frac{1(1+n) - n(1)}{(1+n)^2} = \\frac{r s(1 - s)}{(1+n)^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial s} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} (p - kn - csn) = -cn $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial n} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n} (p - kn - csn) = -k - cs $$\nNow, we evaluate these derivatives at the steady state $(s^{\\ast}, n^{\\ast}) = (0.8, 1)$ using the given parameter values:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial s}\\bigg|_{(0.8, 1)} = (1)(1 - 2(0.8))\\frac{1}{1+1} - 0.1 = (1 - 1.6)\\frac{1}{2} - 0.1 = -0.3 - 0.1 = -0.4 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial n}\\bigg|_{(0.8, 1)} = \\frac{(1)(0.8)(1 - 0.8)}{(1+1)^2} = \\frac{0.16}{4} = 0.04 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial s}\\bigg|_{(0.8, 1)} = -(0.3)(1) = -0.3 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial n}\\bigg|_{(0.8, 1)} = -0.5 - (0.3)(0.8) = -0.5 - 0.24 = -0.74 $$\nThus, the Jacobian matrix at the steady state is:\n$$ J = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.4 & 0.04 \\\\ -0.3 & -0.74 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**3) Eigenvalues and Stability Analysis**\n\nThe local stability of the steady state is determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix $J$.

The eigenvalues are therefore real and distinct.\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{-1.14 \\pm 0.26}{2} $$\nThe two eigenvalues are:\n$$ \\lambda_1 = \\frac{-1.14 + 0.26}{2} = \\frac{-0.88}{2} = -0.44 $$\n$$ \\lambda_2 = \\frac{-1.14 - 0.26}{2} = \\frac{-1.40}{2} = -0.70 $$\nBoth eigenvalues, $\\lambda_1 = -0.44\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$ and $\\lambda_2 = -0.70\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$, are negative real numbers. According to the Hartman-Grobman theorem, the local behavior of the nonlinear system near the equilibrium point is qualitatively the same as its linearization. Since both eigenvalues have negative real parts, the steady state $(s^{\\ast}, n^{\\ast}) = (0.8, 1)$ is locally asymptotically stable. Specifically, as the eigenvalues are real and distinct, it is a stable node.\n\nThe problem asks for the eigenvalues to be listed in descending order.

Here $N=n_0+n_2$.\nFirst, evaluate the maximized log-likelihoods.\nFor $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{sym}}$, with $\\hat{\\theta} = \\frac{n_2}{n_0+n_2}$:\n$$\n\\ln \\hat{L}_{\\mathrm{sym}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{(n_0+n_2)!}{n_0! n_2!}\\right) + n_0 \\ln\\left(1-\\frac{n_2}{n_0+n_2}\\right) + n_2 \\ln\\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_0+n_2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln \\hat{L}_{\\mathrm{sym}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{(n_0+n_2)!}{n_0! n_2!}\\right) + n_0 \\ln\\left(\\frac{n_0}{n_0+n_2}\\right) + n_2 \\ln\\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_0+n_2}\\right)\n$$\nFor $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{bal}}$, with $n_1=0$, the MLE is $\\hat{\\alpha} = \\frac{n_0+n_2}{2(n_0+n_2)} = \\frac{1}{2}$. The model probabilities become $P(X=0)=1/2$, $P(X=1)=0$, $P(X=2)=1/2$.\nThe maximized likelihood is:\n$$\n\\hat{L}_{\\mathrm{bal}} = \\frac{(n_0+n_2)!}{n_0! 0! n_2!} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{n_0} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{n_2} = \\frac{(n_0+n_2)!}{n_0! n_2!} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{n_0+n_2}\n$$\nThe log-likelihood is:\n$$\n\\ln \\hat{L}_{\\mathrm{bal}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{(n_0+n_2)!}{n_0! n_2!}\\right) - (n_0+n_2)\\ln 2\n$$\nNow, compute the difference for $\\Delta \\mathrm{AIC}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{AIC} = 2(\\ln \\hat{L}_{\\mathrm{sym}} - \\ln \\hat{L}_{\\mathrm{bal}}) = 2\\left[ \\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{N!}{n_0! n_2!}\\right) + n_0 \\ln\\frac{n_0}{N} + n_2 \\ln\\frac{n_2}{N}\\right) - \\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{N!}{n_0! n_2!}\\right) - N\\ln 2\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{AIC} = 2\\left[ n_0 \\ln\\frac{n_0}{N} + n_2 \\ln\\frac{n_2}{N} + N\\ln 2 \\right]\n$$\nwhere $N=n_0+n_2$. Substituting $N$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{AIC} = 2 [ n_0(\\ln n_0 - \\ln(n_0+n_2)) + n_2(\\ln n_2 - \\ln(n_0+n_2)) + (n_0+n_2)\\ln 2 ]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{AIC} = 2 [ n_0 \\ln n_0 + n_2 \\ln n_2 - (n_0+n_2)\\ln(n_0+n_2) + (n_0+n_2)\\ln 2 ]\n$$\nThis expression is valid for $n_1=0$. If $n_0=0$ or $n_2=0$, the convention $x\\ln x \\to 0$ as $x \\to 0$ must be used.\n\n**4.
