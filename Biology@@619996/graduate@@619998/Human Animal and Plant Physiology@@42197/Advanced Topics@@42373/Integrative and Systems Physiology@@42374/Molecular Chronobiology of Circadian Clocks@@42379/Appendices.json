This exercise explores this crucial connection by examining how the degradation rate of a core clock protein, PER, controls the overall period of the oscillator. By applying a powerful analytical technique known as nondimensionalization, you will derive the quantitative relationship between protein stability and clock speed, providing a clear link from a genetic mutation to a change in organismal behavior. [@problem_id:2584591]", "problem": "A central feature of circadian timekeeping in mammals is a delayed negative-feedback loop in which the Period protein (PER) accumulates, enters the nucleus, represses its own transcription, and is then removed primarily through phosphorylation-dependent degradation catalyzed by Casein Kinase 1 delta (CK1δ). Consider a reduced post-translationally dominated oscillator in which the effective PER turnover, encompassing phosphorylation, processing, and proteasomal clearance, is well-approximated by a single first-order rate constant $k$ acting on the total PER pool $P(t)$, while the net input flux into the PER pool, $J(t)$, arises from the upstream transcription-translation-delayed repression module. Assume the following:\n- PER removal is first-order: the removal flux is $k\\,P(t)$.\n- The kinase mutation CK1δ T44A reduces CK1δ catalytic activity and thereby decreases the effective PER turnover rate constant from $k$ to $k'$, with no change in upstream synthesis parameters.\n- You are working in the singular regime where post-translational PER turnover sets the characteristic timescale of the limit cycle, whereas all remaining processes contribute negligible additional delays; equivalently, the oscillator period $T$ is controlled by the single turnover timescale so that time can be nondimensionalized by $1/k$ without altering the dimensionless dynamics.\n\n1) Starting from mass-action removal for PER and the above singular-timescale assumption, use a nondimensionalization argument to show that the circadian period scales inversely with the effective PER turnover rate constant, i.e., $T \\propto 1/k$.\n\n2) Given that the CK1δ T44A mutation causes a $0.20$ decrease in PER turnover, so that $k' = (1 - 0.20)\\,k = 0.80\\,k$, estimate the fractional change in period, defined as $\\Delta T/T \\equiv (T' - T)/T$, where $T'$ is the new period.

Do not round your answer.", "solution": "The problem presented is a valid, well-posed exercise in the application of dimensional analysis to a simplified model of a biological oscillator. It is scientifically grounded in the known principles of circadian chronobiology and is free of internal contradictions or ambiguities. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in analyzing the dynamics of the Period protein (PER) concentration, which we denote as $P(t)$. The temporal evolution of $P(t)$ is determined by the balance between an input flux, $J(t)$, from transcription and translation, and a first-order removal process. This is expressed by the following ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d P(t)}{dt} = J(t) - k P(t)\n$$\nHere, $k$ is the effective rate constant for PER turnover. The input flux $J(t)$ is a result of a delayed negative feedback loop, meaning it is a functional of the history of $P(t)$.\n\n1) To demonstrate the scaling relationship between the period $T$ and the rate constant $k$, we employ a nondimensionalization argument, as stipulated by the problem. The central premise is that in the specified singular regime, the dynamics are controlled by a single timescale, which is the characteristic time of PER turnover, $1/k$.\n\nLet us define a dimensionless time variable $\\theta$ and a dimensionless concentration $\\tilde{P}(\\theta)$:\n$$\n\\theta = k t\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{P}(\\theta) = \\frac{P(t)}{P_{\\text{ref}}}\n$$\nwhere $P_{\\text{ref}}$ is a characteristic concentration scale that we will determine. From the definition of $\\theta$, we can transform the time derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} = \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} \\frac{d}{d\\theta} = k \\frac{d}{d\\theta}\n$$\nSubstituting these dimensionless variables into the governing equation gives:\n$$\nk \\frac{d (P_{\\text{ref}} \\tilde{P})}{d\\theta} = J(\\theta/k) - k (P_{\\text{ref}} \\tilde{P})\n$$\nThe input flux $J$ represents the synthesis rate. The problem states that upstream synthesis parameters are unchanged by the mutation affecting $k$. Let us assume the functional form of the feedback, which determines $J$, is independent of $k$ and that $J$ scales with a characteristic synthesis rate, $v_s$. Thus, we can write $J(t)$ as $v_s \\cdot \\mathcal{J}[\\tilde{P}]$, where $\\mathcal{J}$ is a dimensionless functional representing the feedback logic. The equation becomes:\n$$\nk P_{\\text{ref}} \\frac{d\\tilde{P}}{d\\theta} = v_s \\mathcal{J}[\\tilde{P}] - k P_{\\text{ref}} \\tilde{P}\n$$\nDividing by $k P_{\\text{ref}}$ yields the dimensionless dynamical equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tilde{P}}{d\\theta} = \\frac{v_s}{k P_{\\text{ref}}} \\mathcal{J}[\\tilde{P}] - \\tilde{P}\n$$\nThe problem states that \"time can be nondimensionalized by $1/k$ without altering the dimensionless dynamics.\" This requires that the resulting dimensionless equation must be independent of the parameter $k$. For this to hold, the coefficient of the synthesis term, $\\frac{v_s}{k P_{\\text{ref}}}$, must be a constant independent of $k$. We can ensure this by choosing our reference concentration $P_{\\text{ref}}$ to be proportional to $v_s/k$. A natural choice is to set the coefficient to unity, which implies $P_{\\text{ref}} = v_s/k$. This is a physically consistent choice, as it sets the characteristic concentration scale by the balance of production and degradation rates.\n\nWith this choice, the dimensionless equation for the oscillator simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tilde{P}(\\theta)}{d\\theta} = \\mathcal{J}[\\tilde{P}] - \\tilde{P}(\\theta)\n$$\nSince this equation and the functional $\\mathcal{J}$ contain no parameters that depend on $k$, its solution, $\\tilde{P}(\\theta)$, will be a periodic function with a dimensionless period, which we denote as $\\mathcal{T}$, that is a universal constant for this system.\n\nThe dimensional period $T$ is the time it takes for one full oscillation. The corresponding interval in dimensionless time is $\\mathcal{T}$. The relationship between dimensional and dimensionless time is $\\theta = k t$. Therefore, the periods are related by:\n$$\n\\mathcal{T} = k T\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$\nT = \\frac{\\mathcal{T}}{k}\n$$\nSince $\\mathcal{T}$ is a constant, this demonstrates that the circadian period $T$ is inversely proportional to the effective PER turnover rate constant $k$, i.e., $T \\propto 1/k$. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\n2) Now we apply this result to calculate the fractional change in period due to the CK1δ T44A mutation.\nLet the original period and turnover rate be $T$ and $k$, respectively. Let the new period and turnover rate after the mutation be $T'$ and $k'$.\nFrom the derived scaling relationship, we have:\n$$\nT = \\frac{\\mathcal{T}}{k} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad T' = \\frac{\\mathcal{T}}{k'}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{T}$ is the same constant in both cases because the mutation only affects $k$ and does not alter the dimensionless dynamics.\n\nThe fractional change in period is defined as $\\frac{\\Delta T}{T} = \\frac{T' - T}{T}$. We can express this as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta T}{T} = \\frac{T'}{T} - 1\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $T$ and $T'$:\n$$\n\\frac{T'}{T} = \\frac{\\mathcal{T}/k'}{\\mathcal{T}/k} = \\frac{k}{k'}\n$$\nSo, the fractional change is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta T}{T} = \\frac{k}{k'} - 1\n$$\nThe problem provides that the mutation causes a $0.20$ decrease in PER turnover, which means:\n$$\nk' = (1 - 0.20) k = 0.80 k\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the fractional change:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta T}{T} = \\frac{k}{0.80 k} - 1 = \\frac{1}{0.80} - 1\n$$\nCalculating the value:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{0.80} = \\frac{1}{8/10} = \\frac{10}{8} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25\n$$\nTherefore, the fractional change in period is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta T}{T} = 1.25 - 1 = 0.25\n$$\nThe result is a positive fractional change of $0.25$, which corresponds to a $25\\%$ lengthening of the circadian period, a direct consequence of the $20\\%$ decrease in the rate of PER protein removal.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.25}\n$$", "id": "2584591"}, {"introduction": "Observed daily rhythms in physiology and behavior are often a mix of outputs from the endogenous circadian clock and direct responses to environmental cues like light and activity, an effect known as masking.

This is the step that introduces the $t_0$ dependency.\n4.  **Total Effect:** The final effects $E_b$ and $E_s$ are the products of the sensitivities and the Hill responses.\n\n**Step 2: Grid Search for Optimal Dosing Time $t_0^\\star$**\n\nTo find the optimal dosing time, we perform a grid search over $t_0 \\in [0, 24)$ with a fine step (e.g., $\\Delta t_0 = 0.01$ hours). For each candidate $t_0$ on this grid, we compute $U(t_0)$ as described above. The optimal time $t_0^\\star$ is the one that yields the maximum utility value. In case of a tie, the problem specifies selecting the smallest $t_0$.\n\nFor Case 3, where circadian amplitudes are zero and other parameters are matched, the net effect integrand is zero, leading to $U(t_0) = 0$ for all $t_0$. The optimal time is thus $0.00$ by the tie-breaking rule.\n\nA Python implementation of this numerical solution is provided below.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the optimal drug dosing time for a set of chronopharmacology models.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1 (happy path with anti-phasic adverse sensitivity):\n        (2.0, 10.0, 40.0, 0.2, 0.3, 1.5, 0.5, 6.0, 0.5, 18.0, 0.7),\n        # Case 2 (very short half-life, stronger emphasis on exact timing):\n        (0.5, 10.0, 40.0, 0.2, 0.3, 1.5, 0.5, 6.0, 0.5, 18.0, 0.7),\n        # Case 3 (no circadian modulation, flat sensitivities; tie-breaking required):\n        (2.0, 10.0, 40.0, 0.2, 0.2, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0),\n        # Case 4 (heavily weighted adverse effects overlapping beneficial phase):\n        (2.0, 10.0, 40.0, 0.2, 0.2, 1.0, 0.25, 10.0, 0.6, 12.0, 2.0),\n    ]\n\n    final_results = []\n    \n    # Numerical integration and search grid parameters\n    delta_tau = 0.01  # hours\n    tau_grid = np.arange(0, 24, delta_tau)\n    \n    delta_t0 = 0.01   # hours\n    t0_grid = np.arange(0, 24, delta_t0)\n\n    for params in test_cases:\n        t_half, D, V, ec50_b, ec50_s, h, A_b, phi_b, A_s, phi_s, lam = params\n\n        # PK model: Calculate concentration profile C(tau).
