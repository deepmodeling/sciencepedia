It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of ion channel biophysics and synaptic physiology. The provided data are realistic, and the assumptions serve to create a well-posed problem with a unique, stable solution based on fundamental definitions. The problem is free from ambiguity, contradiction, and factual error. The required calculations are a direct application of first principles.\n\nWe proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the increase in conductance and current resulting from the insertion of $N$ new AMPA receptors. This requires calculating the total contribution of these newly added channels.\n\nFirst, we compute the expected peak increase in the ensemble-averaged postsynaptic conductance, denoted as $\\Delta G$. The macroscopic conductance ($G$) of a population of ion channels is the product of the number of channels ($N$), the single-channel conductance ($\\gamma$), and the probability that a channel is in the open state ($P_o$). The assumption of independent gating allows for this simple multiplication. The increase in conductance, $\\Delta G$, is therefore the macroscopic conductance of the newly inserted population of receptors.\n\n$$ \\Delta G = N \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot P_o $$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$N = 10$\n$\\gamma = 15 \\text{ pS} = 15 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ S}$\n$P_o = 0.35$\n\n$$ \\Delta G = 10 \\cdot (15 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ S}) \\cdot 0.35 $$\n$$ \\Delta G = 150 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ S} \\cdot 0.35 $$\n$$ \\Delta G = 52.5 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ S} = 52.5 \\text{ pS} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer in nanosiemens (nS).

The current ($I$) flowing through an ensemble of channels is governed by Ohm's law, where the current is the product of the conductance ($G$) and the electrochemical driving force. The driving force is the difference between the membrane potential ($V_m$) and the reversal potential for the ions passing through the channel ($E_{rev}$).\n\nThe increase in current, $\\Delta I$, is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta I = \\Delta G \\cdot (V_m - E_{rev}) $$\n\nSubstituting the calculated value for $\\Delta G$ and the given values for the potentials:\n$\\Delta G = 52.5 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ S}$\n$V_m = -70 \\text{ mV} = -70 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V}$\n$E_{rev} = 0 \\text{ mV} = 0 \\text{ V}$\n\n$$ \\Delta I = (52.5 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ S}) \\cdot (-70 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V} - 0 \\text{ V}) $$\n$$ \\Delta I = (52.5 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ S}) \\cdot (-70 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V}) $$\n$$ \\Delta I = -3675 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ A} $$\n\nThe result is required in picoamperes (pA).

The problem asks for the \"increase in EPSC amplitude\". In electrophysiology, the amplitude of an inward current is conventionally reported as a positive value representing its magnitude. Therefore, the increase in amplitude is the absolute value of the calculated change in current.\n\nIncrease in EPSC amplitude $= |\\Delta I| = |-3.675 \\text{ pA}| = 3.675 \\text{ pA}$.\n\nThe final step is to round the results to three significant figures as specified.\nThe conductance increase is $\\Delta G = 0.0525 \\text{ nS}$.
