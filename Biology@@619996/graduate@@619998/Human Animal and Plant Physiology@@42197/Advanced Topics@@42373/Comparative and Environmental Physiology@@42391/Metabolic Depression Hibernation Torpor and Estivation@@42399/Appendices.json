Specifically, for each parameter set, count how many stress levels in the grid\n$$\n\\mathcal{S} = \\{ 0.00, 0.05, 0.10, \\dots, 0.95, 1.00 \\}\n$$\nadmit at least two distinct stable fixed points of the ODE system.\n\nScientific basis and constraints. Your program must implement a principled method to determine the number of distinct stable fixed points at each $S \\in \\mathcal{S}$ by combining the following:\n- Existence search: from a grid of initial conditions $(A(0), M(0))$ covering a plausible bounding box based on production-to-degradation ratios (e.g., $A \\lesssim \\frac{k_A}{\\gamma_A}$, $M \\lesssim \\frac{k_M}{\\gamma_M}(1-S)$), numerically integrate the ODEs until convergence to steady state to discover candidate equilibria.\n- Stability test: given a candidate equilibrium $(A^\\ast, M^\\ast)$ at fixed $S$, compute the Jacobian matrix\n$$\nJ(A^\\ast,M^\\ast;S) =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-\\gamma_A & k_A(1-S)\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial M}\\left[\\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{M}{\\theta_M}\\right)^{n}}\\right]\\bigg|_{M=M^\\ast} \\\\\nk_M(1-S)\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial A}\\left[\\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{A}{\\theta_A}\\right)^{n}}\\right]\\bigg|_{A=A^\\ast} & -\\gamma_M\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nand classify the equilibrium as stable if all eigenvalues of $J$ have negative real parts. Use the exact derivative\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left[\\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{x}{\\theta}\\right)^{n}}\\right] = -\\frac{n}{\\theta}\\,\\frac{\\left(\\frac{x}{\\theta}\\right)^{n-1}}{\\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{x}{\\theta}\\right)^{n}\\right)^{2}}.\n$$\n- Distinctness criterion: equilibria reached from different initial conditions should be clustered, and two equilibria should be considered distinct if their Euclidean distance in $(A,M)$-space exceeds a small tolerance (e.g., $10^{-4}$).\n\nYour program must apply this method uniformly to each $S \\in \\mathcal{S}$ and, for each parameter set, return the integer count of $S$-values for which at least two distinct stable fixed points exist.\n\nTest suite. Your program must hard-code and evaluate the following parameter sets, each expressed as the tuple $(n, k_A, k_M, \\theta_A, \\theta_M, \\gamma_A, \\gamma_M)$:\n- Case $1$ (symmetric, strongly cooperative): $(4, 3.0, 3.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0)$.\n- Case $2$ (weak cooperativity): $(1, 3.0, 3.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0)$.\n- Case $3$ (asymmetric thresholds and degradation): $(3, 2.0, 2.0, 0.3, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2)$.\n- Case $4$ (strong production and cooperativity): $(5, 5.0, 4.0, 0.4, 0.4, 1.0, 1.0)$.\n\nOutput specification. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, e.g., $[r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4]$, where $r_i$ is the integer number of $S$-values in $\\mathcal{S}$ with at least two distinct stable equilibria for Case $i$. No spaces are permitted in the output line. All variables and parameters are dimensionless, so no physical units are required. Angles are not used. Percentages must be treated as decimals; the specified grid $\\mathcal{S}$ already uses decimal representation.", "solution": "The problem presents a valid and well-defined task in computational systems biology. It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of modeling biochemical networks, specifically the use of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with Hill-type kinetics to represent mutual inhibition in signaling pathways like the one involving AMPK and mTOR. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary equations, parameters, and a clear, objective procedure for finding the solution. It is free from ambiguity, factual errors, and non-scientific claims. Therefore, a reasoned solution can be constructed.\n\nThe objective is to determine the extent of bistability in a model of metabolic regulation for several parameter sets. Bistability, the existence of two distinct stable steady states for a given set of external conditions, is a key mechanism for generating switch-like cellular responses. Here, the external condition is the energy-stress parameter $S$. A high count of $S$-values that support bistability indicates a robust switching mechanism.\n\nThe solution strategy follows the prescribed computational method. For each of the four parameter cases, we iterate through every stress level $S$ in the grid $\\mathcal{S} = \\{ 0.00, 0.05, \\dots, 1.00 \\}$. At each $S$, we must find the number of distinct, stable fixed points of the given ODE system:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = k_A \\left( S + (1 - S)\\,\\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{M}{\\theta_M}\\right)^{n}} \\right) - \\gamma_A A\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = k_M \\left( (1 - S)\\,\\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{A}{\\theta_A}\\right)^{n}} \\right) - \\gamma_M M\n$$\nThe number of $S$-values for which at least two such stable fixed points exist is then tallied.\n\nThe process for identifying stable fixed points for a specific $S$ and parameter set is threefold:\n\n1.  **Existence Search via Numerical Integration**: The attractors (including stable fixed points) of the dynamical system are found by simulating the system's evolution from a wide range of initial conditions. A grid of initial points $(A(0), M(0))$ is created within a bounding box defined by the production-to-degradation ratios, for instance, $A \\in [0, 1.5 k_A / \\gamma_A]$ and $M \\in [0, 1.5 k_M / \\gamma_M]$. From each initial point, the ODE system is numerically integrated for a sufficiently long duration (e.g., $t \\in [0, 100]$, which is much larger than the characteristic degradation timescales $1/\\gamma_A$ and $1/\\gamma_M$) to allow the system to settle into a steady state. The state of the system at the final time point $(A_{final}, M_{final})$ is a candidate fixed point.\n\n2.  **Clustering of Candidate Fixed Points**: The set of final states obtained from all integrations is processed to identify unique candidates. This is done by clustering. An iterative approach is used: a list of unique fixed points is maintained. For each new candidate point, its Euclidean distance to every point already in the unique list is calculated. If the distance is smaller than a specified tolerance of $10^{-4}$ for all points in the list, it is considered a duplicate and discarded. Otherwise, it is added to the list of unique fixed points.\n\n3.  **Stability Analysis via the Jacobian Matrix**: Each unique candidate fixed point $(A^\\ast, M^\\ast)$ is then tested for linear stability. A fixed point is stable if small perturbations away from it decay over time. This condition is equivalent to requiring that all eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix $J$, evaluated at the fixed point, have negative real parts. The Jacobian matrix is the matrix of first-order partial derivatives of the system's rate equations:\n$$\nJ(A^\\ast,M^\\ast;S) =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial A}\\left(\\frac{dA}{dt}\\right) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial M}\\left(\\frac{dA}{dt}\\right) \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial A}\\left(\\frac{dM}{dt}\\right) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial M}\\left(\\frac{dM}{dt}\\right)\n\\end{pmatrix}\\Bigg|_{(A^\\ast,M^\\ast)}\n$$\nFor the given system, the components of the Jacobian are:\n$$\nJ =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-\\gamma_A & k_A(1-S)\\,\\frac{d}{dM}h(M;\\theta_M,n)\\big|_{M^\\ast} \\\\\nk_M(1-S)\\,\\frac{d}{dA}h(A;\\theta_A,n)\\big|_{A^\\ast} & -\\gamma_M\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $h(x;\\theta,n) = (1 + (x/\\theta)^n)^{-1}$ is the Hill repression function. The required derivative is explicitly given as:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}h(x;\\theta,n) = -\\frac{n}{\\theta}\\,\\frac{\\left(\\frac{x}{\\theta}\\right)^{n-1}}{\\left(1 + \\left(\\fracx}{\\theta}\\right)^{n}\\right)^{2}}\n$$\nWe compute the eigenvalues of this $2 \\times 2$ matrix for each $(A^\\ast, M^\\ast)$ and count the number of points for which all eigenvalue real parts are negative.\n\nIf this count of stable fixed points is two or more, the system is considered bistable for that value of $S$. The final answer for each parameter case is the total number of $S$-values in the grid $\\mathcal{S}$ that exhibit this bistability.
