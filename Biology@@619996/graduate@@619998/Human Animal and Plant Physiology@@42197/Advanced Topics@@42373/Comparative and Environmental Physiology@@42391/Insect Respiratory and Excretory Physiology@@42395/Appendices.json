It is well-posed, providing a complete set of consistent data and clear objectives, allowing for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The physical values, while representing a specific scenario, are plausible within the context of insect physiology. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be constructed.\n\nThe starting point is Fick's first law of diffusion in one dimension, which relates the molar flux $J$ (amount of substance flowing per unit area per unit time) to the concentration gradient $\\frac{dC}{dx}$:\n$$J = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}$$\nThe negative sign indicates that diffusion occurs from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration.\n\nThe molar flow rate, which we denote as $\\dot{n}$, is the total amount of substance flowing through the entire cross-section of the tube per unit time. It is obtained by multiplying the flux $J$ by the cross-sectional area $A$ of the tracheal tube:\n$$\\dot{n} = J \\cdot A = -D \\cdot A \\cdot \\frac{dC}{dx}$$\nThe problem states that the cross-section is uniform, so $A$ is constant along the length of the tube. The tracheal tube is a cylinder, so its cross-sectional area is given by $A = \\pi r^2$.\n\nUnder the assumption of steady-state diffusion, the molar flow rate $\\dot{n}$ is constant along the axial direction $x$. We can integrate the expression for $\\dot{n}$ along the length of the tube from $x=0$ to $x=L$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{L} \\dot{n}\\,dx = \\int_{C_1}^{C_2} -D \\cdot A\\,dC$$\nSince $\\dot{n}$, $D$, and $A$ are constant, we have:\n$$\\dot{n} \\cdot L = -D \\cdot A \\cdot (C_2 - C_1) = D \\cdot A \\cdot (C_1 - C_2)$$\nHere, $C_1$ is the concentration at the entrance ($x=0$) and $C_2$ is the concentration at the exit ($x=L$). The concentration difference across the segment is $\\Delta C = C_1 - C_2$. Therefore, we can write:\n$$\\dot{n} \\cdot L = D \\cdot A \\cdot \\Delta C$$\nSolving for the molar flow rate $\\dot{n}$, we obtain the expression:\n$$\\dot{n} = \\frac{D \\cdot A \\cdot \\Delta C}{L}$$\nThis is the same result obtained by approximating the gradient $\\frac{dC}{dx}$ as $-\\frac{\\Delta C}{L}$ for a linear concentration profile, which is the exact profile under these steady-state, one-dimensional conditions.\n\nThe problem provides a relationship between the concentration difference $\\Delta C$ and the partial pressure difference $\\Delta P$: $\\Delta C = \\alpha \\Delta P$.
