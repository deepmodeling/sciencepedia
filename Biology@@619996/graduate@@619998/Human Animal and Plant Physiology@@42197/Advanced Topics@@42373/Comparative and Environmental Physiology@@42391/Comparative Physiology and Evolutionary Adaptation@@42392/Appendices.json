This exercise guides you through a quantitative comparison of the circulatory systems of an endotherm and an ectotherm of equal size.

The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities. It is a standard application of fundamental physiological principles to a comparative context.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be constructed.\n\nThe solution proceeds by applying the two fundamental principles stipulated in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, the relationship between bulk flow (Cardiac Output, $CO$), driving pressure (Mean Arterial Pressure, $MAP$), and hydraulic resistance (Total Peripheral Resistance, $TPR$) is analogous to Ohm's Law and is given by:\n$$MAP = CO \\times TPR$$\nFrom this, cardiac output can be calculated as:\n$$CO = \\frac{MAP}{TPR}$$\nSecond, cardiac output is defined as the product of heart rate ($HR$) and stroke volume ($SV$):\n$$CO = HR \\times SV$$\nFrom this, stroke volume can be calculated as:\n$$SV = \\frac{CO}{HR}$$\n\nWe will now apply these principles to each species.\n\nFor Species A (endotherm):\nThe given values are $MAP_A = 100 \\text{ mmHg}$, $TPR_A = 0.280 \\text{ mmHg} \\cdot \\text{min} \\cdot \\text{mL}^{-1}$, and $HR_A = 120 \\text{ beats} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1}$.\n\nThe cardiac output for Species A, $CO_A$, is calculated as:\n$$CO_A = \\frac{MAP_A}{TPR_A} = \\frac{100 \\text{ mmHg}}{0.280 \\text{ mmHg} \\cdot \\text{min} \\cdot \\text{mL}^{-1}} = \\frac{2500}{7} \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1} \\approx 357.14 \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1}$$\nThe stroke volume for Species A, $SV_A$, is then calculated using the computed $CO_A$ and given $HR_A$:\n$$SV_A = \\frac{CO_A}{HR_A} = \\frac{\\frac{2500}{7} \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1}}{120 \\text{ beats} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1}} = \\frac{2500}{7 \\times 120} \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{beat}^{-1} = \\frac{250}{84} \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{beat}^{-1} = \\frac{125}{42} \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{beat}^{-1} \\approx 2.976 \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{beat}^{-1}$$\n\nFor Species B (ectotherm):\nThe given values are $MAP_B = 40 \\text{ mmHg}$, $TPR_B = 0.800 \\text{ mmHg} \\cdot \\text{min} \\cdot \\text{mL}^{-1}$, and $HR_B = 20 \\text{ beats} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1}$.\n\nThe cardiac output for Species B, $CO_B$, is calculated as:\n$$CO_B = \\frac{MAP_B}{TPR_B} = \\frac{40 \\text{ mmHg}}{0.800 \\text{ mmHg} \\cdot \\text{min} \\cdot \\text{mL}^{-1}} = 50 \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1}$$\nThe stroke volume for Species B, $SV_B$, is then calculated using the computed $CO_B$ and given $HR_B$:\n$$SV_B = \\frac{CO_B}{HR_B} = \\frac{50 \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1}}{20 \\text{ beats} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1}} = 2.5 \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{beat}^{-1}$$\n\nInterpretation of computed values:\nThe endothermic mammal (Species A) has a cardiac output ($CO_A \\approx 357 \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1}$) that is more than seven times greater than that of the ectothermic reptile (Species B) of the same mass ($CO_B = 50 \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1}$). This drastic difference is a direct reflection of the much higher resting metabolic rate of endotherms, which necessitates a significantly higher rate of oxygen and nutrient delivery to tissues and removal of metabolic byproducts.\n\nThis high flow rate in the endotherm is achieved through a combination of cardiovascular parameters. Species A maintains a mean arterial pressure ($100 \\text{ mmHg}$) that is $2.5$ times higher than Species B ($40 \\text{ mmHg}$). This high pressure drives blood through a systemic circuit with a significantly lower total peripheral resistance ($TPR_A = 0.280$ vs $TPR_B = 0.800$), which is characteristic of the extensive vascularization required to support high metabolic activity. The most dramatic difference is in heart rate, where the endotherm's heart beats $6$ times faster ($HR_A = 120$ vs $HR_B = 20 \\text{ beats} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1}$). In contrast, the stroke volumes are quite similar ($SV_A \\approx 2.98 \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{beat}^{-1}$ vs $SV_B = 2.5 \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{beat}^{-1}$). This demonstrates that the evolutionary adaptation for endothermy involves developing a high-pressure, high-frequency pump and a low-resistance circulatory network, rather than a simple increase in the volume of blood ejected per heartbeat.\n\nFinally, the ratio of the stroke volume of Species A to Species B, $\\frac{SV_A}{SV_B}$, is computed.\n$$ \\frac{SV_A}{SV_B} = \\frac{\\frac{125}{42} \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{beat}^{-1}}{2.5 \\text{ mL} \\cdot \\text{beat}^{-1}} = \\frac{\\frac{125}{42}}{\\frac{5}{2}} = \\frac{125}{42} \\times \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{250}{210} = \\frac{25}{21} $$\nAs a decimal, this ratio is approximately $1.190476...$.

A negative sensitivity means that $\\ln M^{\\ast}$ (and thus $M^{\\ast}$) decreases as temperature $T$ increases. This corresponds to a **Bergmann-like pattern**, where individuals are larger in colder environments. Mechanistically, this occurs because the activation energy for catabolism ($E_{\\beta}$) is greater than that for anabolism ($E_{\\alpha}$), meaning catabolic processes accelerate more strongly with increasing temperature than anabolic processes. This shifts the balance between anabolism and catabolism, leading to a smaller equilibrium size at higher temperatures.\n-   If $E_{\\alpha}  E_{\\beta}$, then $E_{\\alpha} - E_{\\beta}  0$, which implies $s(T)  0$. A positive sensitivity means that $M^{\\ast}$ increases as temperature $T$ increases. This corresponds to a **converse Bergmann-like pattern**, where individuals are larger in warmer environments. Mechanistically, anabolism is more sensitive to temperature changes than catabolism. As temperature rises, anabolic rates increase more rapidly than catabolic rates, supporting a larger final body mass.\n\nPart $2$: Calculation of the mass ratio $R$.\n\nWe are asked to compute the ratio $R = \\frac{M^{\\ast}(T_2)}{M^{\\ast}(T_1)}$ for a warmer temperature $T_2 = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$ and a cooler temperature $T_1 = 283\\ \\mathrm{K}$. Using the derived expression for $M^{\\ast}(T)$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{\\alpha_0}{\\beta_0} \\right)^3 \\exp\\left( \\frac{3(E_{\\beta} - E_{\\alpha})}{k_B T_2} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{\\alpha_0}{\\beta_0} \\right)^3 \\exp\\left( \\frac{3(E_{\\beta} - E_{\\alpha})}{k_B T_1} \\right)}\n$$\nThe pre-exponential factor $(\\alpha_0/\\beta_0)^3$ cancels out:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\exp\\left( \\frac{3(E_{\\beta} - E_{\\alpha})}{k_B T_2} \\right)}{\\exp\\left( \\frac{3(E_{\\beta} - E_{\\alpha})}{k_B T_1} \\right)} = \\exp\\left( \\frac{3(E_{\\beta} - E_{\\alpha})}{k_B T_2} - \\frac{3(E_{\\beta} - E_{\\alpha})}{k_B T_1} \\right)\n$$\nFactoring out the common terms gives the expression for the calculation:\n$$\nR = \\exp\\left( \\frac{3(E_{\\beta} - E_{\\alpha})}{k_B} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1} \\right) \\right)\n$$\nThe given parameters are:\n$E_{\\alpha} = 0.65\\ \\mathrm{eV}$\n$E_{\\beta} = 0.85\\ \\mathrm{eV}$\n$T_1 = 283\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n$T_2 = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n$k_B = 8.617333262 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{eV}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the terms in the exponent:\n$E_{\\beta} - E_{\\alpha} = 0.85\\ \\mathrm{eV} - 0.65\\ \\mathrm{eV} = 0.20\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\nThe expression in the parentheses is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{298\\ \\mathrm{K}} - \\frac{1}{283\\ \\mathrm{K}} = \\frac{283 - 298}{298 \\times 283}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1} = \\frac{-15}{84334}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1} \\approx -1.7786 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}\n$$\nThe term outside the parentheses is:\n$$\n\\frac{3(E_{\\beta} - E_{\\alpha})}{k_B} = \\frac{3 \\times 0.20\\ \\mathrm{eV}}{8.617333262 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{eV}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}} \\approx 6962.79\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nNow, we compute the exponent:\n$$\n\\text{Exponent} = (6962.79\\ \\mathrm{K}) \\times \\left(\\frac{-15}{84334}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}\\right) \\approx -1.23849\n$$\nFinally, we calculate the ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\exp(-1.23849) \\approx 0.28982\n$$\nThe problem specifies rounding the answer to three significant figures.\n$$\nR \\approx 0.290\n$$\nSince $E_{\\beta}  E_{\\alpha}$, the model predicts a Bergmann-like pattern, and indeed the calculated ratio $R = M^{\\ast}(T_2)/M^{\\ast}(T_1)$ is less than $1$, indicating a smaller body size at the warmer temperature $T_2$.
