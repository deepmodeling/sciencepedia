It is expressed in objective, precise language and is free of scientific flaws, inconsistencies, or ambiguities.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation and interpretation of the hydraulic safety margin (HSM) for a woody angiosperm. The HSM is defined by the provided equation:\n$$\n\\mathrm{HSM}=\\psi_{50}-\\psi_{\\min}\n$$\nThe given values are the xylem water potential corresponding to a $50\\%$ loss of hydraulic conductivity, $\\psi_{50} = -3.0~\\mathrm{MPa}$, and the typical minimum midday water potential, $\\psi_{\\min} = -2.2~\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values into the definition yields:\n$$\n\\mathrm{HSM} = (-3.0~\\mathrm{MPa}) - (-2.2~\\mathrm{MPa})\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{HSM} = -3.0~\\mathrm{MPa} + 2.2~\\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{HSM} = -0.8~\\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the answer must be rounded to two significant figures. The calculated value of $-0.8$ has one significant figure. To express this value with two significant figures, it must be written as $-0.80$. Therefore, the hydraulic safety margin is $\\mathrm{HSM} = -0.80~\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nNext, we must interpret this result based on its sign and magnitude. Xylem water potential, $\\psi$, is negative under tension, meaning a more negative value corresponds to a greater, more stressful, tension on the water column.\nThe plant's typical minimum (most negative) operating potential is $\\psi_{\\min} = -2.2~\\mathrm{MPa}$.\nThe potential at which catastrophic dysfunction (defined here as $50\\%$ conductivity loss) occurs is $\\psi_{50} = -3.0~\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nSince $\\psi_{\\min} > \\psi_{50}$ (that is, $-2.2 > -3.0$), the water potential experienced by the plant during peak transpiration is less negative than the potential that would cause a $50\\%$ loss in conductivity. The plant is operating under conditions that are less stressful than this critical threshold.\n\nThe sign of the HSM as defined in this problem, $\\mathrm{HSM} = \\psi_{50} - \\psi_{\\min}$, is negative. A negative result indicates that $\\psi_{50} < \\psi_{\\min}$. This is the condition for safe operation, where the operating potential has not crossed the failure threshold. If the HSM were positive, it would imply $\\psi_{50} > \\psi_{\\min}$, meaning the plant's minimum potential is more negative than the $\\psi_{50}$ threshold, and it would be operating beyond the $50\\%$ loss point, a high-risk condition.\n\nThe magnitude of the HSM, $|\\mathrm{HSM}| = |-0.80~\\mathrm{MPa}| = 0.80~\\mathrm{MPa}$, quantifies the size of this safety buffer. It represents the additional drop in water potential (increase in tension) that the plant can withstand from its typical minimum before reaching the $\\psi_{50}$ threshold. In this case, the plant has a buffer of $0.80~\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nIn conclusion, the negative sign of the HSM indicates the plant is operating with a buffer against the $50\\%$ conductivity loss threshold. The magnitude of $0.80~\\mathrm{MPa}$ quantifies this buffer, showing that the plant's hydraulic system is not operating near its point of catastrophic failure under typical peak conditions.
