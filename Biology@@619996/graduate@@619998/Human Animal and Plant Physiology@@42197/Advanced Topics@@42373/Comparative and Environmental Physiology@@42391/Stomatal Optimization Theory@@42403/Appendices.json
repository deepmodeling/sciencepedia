The analysis begins from the provided formulation of Fick's law for diffusive molar flux.\n\nFirst, we will derive and compute the net $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ assimilation rate, $A$. According to Fick's law as stated, the molar flux is the product of the conductance and the gradient in the molar mixing ratio (mole fraction). For $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ uptake, the flux $A$ is driven by the mole fraction difference between the ambient air, $C_a$, and the intercellular airspaces, $C_i$. The relevant conductance is the stomatal conductance to $\\mathrm{CO}_2$, denoted $g_c$.

A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe goal is to find the optimal stomatal conductance, $g_s^*$, that maximizes the objective function $U(g_s) = A - \\lambda_w E$. The optimum is found by setting the first derivative of $U(g_s)$ with respect to $g_s$ equal to zero: $\\frac{dU}{dg_s} = 0$.\n\nFirst, consider the model that **ignores** the leaf temperature feedback on assimilation. In this case, we treat $A$ as being independent of $T_l$, so its dependence on $g_s$ is primarily through $CO_2$ supply (represented by the \"$\\ldots$\" in the problem's notation for $A$). The objective function is $U_1(g_s) = A(g_s) - \\lambda_w E(g_s)$.\n\nThe optimality condition is:\n$$ \\frac{dU_1}{dg_s} = \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial g_s} - \\lambda_w \\frac{dE}{dg_s} = 0 $$\nGiven $E = k D g_s$, we have $\\frac{dE}{dg_s} = k D$. So the condition becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial g_s} = \\lambda_w k D $$\nThis equation states that at the optimum, the marginal carbon gain from increasing $g_s$ must equal the marginal water cost.\n\nSecond, consider the full model that **includes** the leaf temperature feedback, $g_s \\to T_l \\to A$. The objective function is $U_2(g_s) = A(T_l(g_s), g_s) - \\lambda_w E(g_s)$. To find the derivative $\\frac{dU_2}{dg_s}$, we must use the chain rule for the term $\\frac{dA}{dg_s}$:\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dg_s} = \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial g_s} + \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_l} \\frac{\\partial T_l}{\\partial g_s} $$\nThe full optimality condition is now:\n$$ \\frac{dU_2}{dg_s} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial g_s} + \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_l} \\frac{\\partial T_l}{\\partial g_s}\\right) - \\lambda_w \\frac{dE}{dg_s} = 0 $$\nRearranging, the condition is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial g_s} + \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_l} \\frac{\\partial T_l}{\\partial g_s} = \\lambda_w k D $$\n\nTo understand the change in optimal $g_s$, we must determine the sign of the new term, $\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_l} \\frac{\\partial T_l}{\\partial g_s}$.\n\n1.  **Sign of $\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_l}$**: The problem explicitly states that under the hot conditions considered, $T_l \\gtrsim T_{\\mathrm{opt}}$, and due to factors like Rubisco deactivation, photosynthesis declines with increasing temperature. Therefore, $\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_l} < 0$.\n\n2.  **Sign of $\\frac{\\partial T_l}{\\partial g_s}$**: We derive this from the leaf energy balance.\n    $$ R_n = H + \\Lambda E $$\n    Substitute the expressions for $H$ and $E$:\n    $$ R_n = g_H (T_l - T_a) + \\Lambda (k D g_s) $$\n    Solve for $T_l$:\n    $$ g_H T_l = R_n - \\Lambda k D g_s + g_H T_a $$\n    $$ T_l = \\frac{R_n + g_H T_a}{g_H} - \\left(\\frac{\\Lambda k D}{g_H}\\right) g_s $$\n    Now, take the partial derivative of $T_l$ with respect to $g_s$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial T_l}{\\partial g_s} = - \\frac{\\Lambda k D}{g_H} $$\n    Given that $\\Lambda > 0$, $k > 0$, $D > 0$ (dry conditions), and $g_H > 0$, the entire term is negative. Thus, $\\frac{\\partial T_l}{\\partial g_s} < 0$. This has a clear physical meaning: increasing stomatal conductance increases transpiration, which is a cooling process, thereby lowering the leaf temperature.\n\nNow, evaluate the product:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_l} \\frac{\\partial T_l}{\\partial g_s} = (\\text{negative value}) \\times (\\text{negative value}) = \\text{positive value} > 0 $$\nThis positive term represents an additional, indirect benefit of increasing $g_s$: opening stomata leads to cooling, and under hot conditions, this cooling effect increases the rate of photosynthesis by alleviating thermal stress.\n\nLet us compare the marginal benefits and costs. Let $MCG(g_s)$ be the marginal carbon gain from increasing $g_s$, and $MCC(g_s)$ be the marginal carbon cost. The optimum is where $MCG(g_s) = MCC(g_s)$.\n- In the simple model, $MCG_1(g_s) = \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial g_s}$.\n- In the full model, $MCG_2(g_s) = \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial g_s} + \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_l} \\frac{\\partial T_l}{\\partial g_s}$.\nSince the new term is positive, $MCG_2(g_s) > MCG_1(g_s)$ for any given $g_s$.\nThe marginal cost in both models is the same: $MCC(g_s) = \\lambda_w k D$.\nThe marginal gain term $\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial g_s}$ is a decreasing function of $g_s$ due to substrate limitation for photosynthesis. Since the marginal gain curve for the full model, $MCG_2$, is shifted upwards relative to the curve for the simple model, $MCG_1$, its intersection with the horizontal marginal cost line must occur at a larger value of $g_s$.\nTherefore, including the thermal feedback **increases** the predicted optimal stomatal conductance, $g_s^*$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Including the $T_l$ feedback reduces the optimal $g_s$ under hot, dry conditions because a warmer leaf enhances Rubisco carboxylation, so the marginal carbon gain from closing stomata increases relative to the water cost.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The derivation shows the optimal $g_s$ increases, not reduces. The reasoning is also fundamentally flawed. Under the specified conditions ($T_l \\gtrsim T_{\\mathrm{opt}}$), a warmer leaf does not enhance Rubisco carboxylation; it leads to deactivation and increased photorespiration, hence $\\partial A / \\partial T_l < 0$, which is the opposite of what is claimed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**B. Including the $T_l$ feedback increases the optimal $g_s$ under hot, dry conditions because $\\partial T_l/\\partial g_s < 0$ and $\\partial A/\\partial T_l < 0$, adding a positive cooling benefit to the marginal carbon gain of opening stomata.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with the derivation. It correctly states that optimal $g_s$ increases. It correctly identifies the signs of the key partial derivatives: $\\partial T_l/\\partial g_s < 0$ (transpirational cooling) and $\\partial A/\\partial T_l < 0$ (thermal stress on photosynthesis). It correctly interprets their product as a positive \"cooling benefit\" that adds to the marginal gain of carbon assimilation, thus favoring a higher degree of stomatal opening.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. The optimal $g_s$ is unchanged by the $T_l$ feedback because $T_l$ is effectively decoupled from $g_s$ when radiation is high and wind is moderate, so $\\partial T_l/\\partial g_s \\approx 0$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The derivation shows that optimal $g_s$ does change. The reason provided, $\\partial T_l/\\partial g_s \\approx 0$, is false under the given conditions.

For this to be approximately zero, one would require either $D \\approx 0$ (which contradicts \"dry spell\") or $g_H \\to \\infty$ (implying infinite wind speed, which contradicts \"moderate wind\"). Transpirational cooling is a thermodynamically essential process, and leaf temperature is strongly coupled to stomatal conductance, especially under high radiation and dry air.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Including the $T_l$ feedback reverses the sign of the water-use penalty so that $\\lambda_w$ becomes effectively negative at high $D$, favoring stomatal closure to maximize $U(g_s)$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The parameter $\\lambda_w$ is an externally defined marginal cost of water, and its sign is not altered by the internal biophysics of the leaf. The thermal feedback adds a positive term to the *benefit* side of the optimization equation, it does not modify the *cost* side. Furthermore, the conclusion that this favors stomatal closure is the opposite of the derived result.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2610120"}]}
