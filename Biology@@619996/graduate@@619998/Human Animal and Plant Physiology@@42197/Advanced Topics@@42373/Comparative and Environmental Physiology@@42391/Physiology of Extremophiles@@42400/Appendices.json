The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution requires two parts: first, a derivation of the freezing point depression formula from fundamental thermodynamic principles, and second, the calculation of the required glycerol molality.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Freezing Point Depression Formula\n\nThe equilibrium condition for freezing of a solvent (component A) from a solution is that the chemical potential of the solvent in the liquid phase, $\\mu_A^l$, must be equal to the chemical potential of the pure solid solvent, $\\mu_A^{s,*}$.

This gives:\n$$\n\\ln(x_A) = -\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\text{fus},A}^*(T_f)}{RT_f}\n$$\nTo relate this to the freezing point of the pure solvent, $T_f^*$, we use the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, which describes the temperature dependence of the Gibbs free energy.

The mutations are $3$ Lysine $\\to$ Glutamate and $1$ Arginine $\\to$ Aspartate. The change in charge is the total charge of the new residues minus the total charge of the original residues at this $pH$:\n$$\\Delta Q(pI_{\\mathrm{WT}}) = 3 \\cdot \\left( Q_{\\mathrm{Glu}}(pI_{\\mathrm{WT}}) - Q_{\\mathrm{Lys}}(pI_{\\mathrm{WT}}) \\right) + 1 \\cdot \\left( Q_{\\mathrm{Asp}}(pI_{\\mathrm{WT}}) - Q_{\\mathrm{Arg}}(pI_{\\mathrm{WT}}) \\right)$$\n\nThe charge of each residue is determined by its $pK_a$ and the given formulas. At $pH = 4.80$:\n\nCharge of a Lysine residue ($pK_a = 10.5$): Lysine is a basic residue, carrying a charge of $+1$ when protonated.\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{Lys}} = +1 \\cdot f_{+}(pH) = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pH - pK_a}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{4.80 - 10.5}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-5.7}}$$\n\nCharge of an Arginine residue ($pK_a = 12.5$): Arginine is a basic residue.\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{Arg}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pH - pK_a}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{4.80 - 12.5}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-7.7}}$$\nFor both Lys and Arg, the $pH$ is far below the $pK_a$, so they are essentially fully protonated and have a charge of $+1$.\n\nCharge of a Glutamate residue ($pK_a = 4.2$): Glutamate is an acidic residue, carrying a charge of $-1$ when deprotonated.\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{Glu}} = -1 \\cdot f_{-}(pH) = -\\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pK_a - pH}} = -\\frac{1}{1 + 10^{4.2 - 4.80}} = -\\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-0.6}}$$\n\nCharge of an Aspartate residue ($pK_a = 3.9$): Aspartate is an acidic residue.\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{Asp}} = -\\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pK_a - pH}} = -\\frac{1}{1 + 10^{3.9 - 4.80}} = -\\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-0.9}}$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values:\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{Lys}}(4.80) = \\frac{1}{1 + 1.995 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx +0.999998$$\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{Arg}}(4.80) = \\frac{1}{1 + 1.995 \\times 10^{-8}} \\approx +0.99999998$$\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{Glu}}(4.80) = -\\frac{1}{1 + 0.2511886} \\approx -0.799243$$\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{Asp}}(4.80) = -\\frac{1}{1 + 0.1258925} \\approx -0.888184$$\n\nThe total change in charge is:\n$$\\Delta Q(4.80) = 3 \\cdot (-0.799243 - 0.999998) + 1 \\cdot (-0.888184 - 0.99999998)$$\n$$\\Delta Q(4.80) = 3 \\cdot (-1.799241) + (-1.888184)$$\n$$\\Delta Q(4.80) = -5.397723 - 1.888184 = -7.285907$$\n\nFinally, we compute the shift in the isoelectric point:\n$$\\Delta pI \\approx -\\frac{\\Delta Q(pI_{\\mathrm{WT}})}{S} = -\\frac{-7.285907}{-24.0} = -0.303579$$\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures gives:\n$$\\Delta pI \\approx -0.304$$\n\n**Part 2: Mechanistic Rationale for Surface Charge and Solubility**\n\nThe problem of maintaining protein solubility is acute for halophilic organisms, which thrive in hypersaline environments. At extremely high salt concentrations (e.g., several molar NaCl), water activity is significantly reduced. Most proteins would aggregate and precipitate under these conditions, a phenomenon known as \"salting out.\" This occurs because the abundant salt ions sequester water molecules for their own hydration, leaving insufficient water to maintain the protein's hydration shell, which is critical for its solubility.\n\nHalophilic proteins have evolved a specific adaptation to counteract this effect: an unusually high density of acidic residues (Aspartate and Glutamate) on their solvent-exposed surfaces. The specified mutations (Lys $\\to$ Glu, Arg $\\to$ Asp) are an engineered example of this natural strategy. At neutral or even moderately acidic $pH$, these residues are deprotonated, conferring a large net negative charge on the protein surface. This high surface charge density enhances solubility at high ionic strength through several complementary physicochemical mechanisms:\n\n1.  **Enhanced Hydration Shell:** The carboxylate groups of Asp and Glu are excellent at coordinating water molecules through strong ion-dipole interactions. This creates a tightly bound, stable hydration layer around the protein. This robust shell is less easily disrupted by the high concentration of bulk salt ions, effectively enabling the protein to \"outcompete\" the salt for necessary solvating water molecules.\n\n2.  **Binding of Hydrated Cations:** The highly negative surface attracts and binds a layer of hydrated cations (e.g., $K^+$, $Na^+$) from the solution. This forms a complex solvation sphere composed of the protein, bound ions, and their associated water molecules. This entire complex is more readily solubilized in the hypersaline medium. Instead of being a liability, the high salt concentration becomes an integral part of the protein's solvation structure.\n\n3.  **Inter-protein Electrostatic Repulsion:** Although electrostatic interactions are heavily screened at high ionic strength (i.e., the Debye length is very short), the sheer magnitude of the negative charge on each protein creates a powerful repulsive force at the very short distances relevant for contact and aggregation. This strong, short-range repulsion provides a kinetic and thermodynamic barrier against the close approach of protein molecules, thereby preventing the hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions that drive aggregation.\n\nIn summary, by increasing the density of negative charge on the protein surface, the engineered mutations enhance the protein's ability to structure a stable solvation environment around itself and maintain strong repulsive forces, thus preventing aggregation in a high-salinity milieu. This is a fundamental principle of proteostasis in extremophiles.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-0.304}\n$$", "id": "2595415"}]}
