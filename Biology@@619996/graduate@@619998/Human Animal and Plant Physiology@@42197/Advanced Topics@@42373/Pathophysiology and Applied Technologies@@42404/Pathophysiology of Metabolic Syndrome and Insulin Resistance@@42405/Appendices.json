In the fasting, steady-state condition, hepatic glucose output and peripheral glucose uptake are balanced, and pancreatic insulin secretion adjusts to maintain a relatively stable plasma glucose. In such a basal steady state, the simplest first-principles approximation treats the index of insulin resistance as directly proportional to the product of fasting plasma glucose concentration, denoted $G$, and fasting plasma insulin concentration, denoted $I$. The proportionality constant is chosen by normalization: at a healthy reference state with fasting plasma glucose $G_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 4.5\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$ and fasting plasma insulin $I_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 5.0\\ \\mu\\mathrm{U/mL}$, the index is defined to be $1$.

This relationship is expressed as:\n$$H = k \\cdot G \\cdot I$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality whose value depends on the units used for $G$ and $I$. The problem specifies that the HOMA-IR index $H$ is normalized to $1$ for a healthy reference state.\n\nFirst, we will determine the proportionality constant and the formula for $H$ using the SI-based units provided for the reference state.

As all parameters are positive, this term is positive. Thus, $\\frac{\\partial M_{D}^{\\ast}}{\\partial k_{3}} > 0$. Increasing $k_{3}$ will increase $M_{D}^{\\ast}$. This is logical: increasing the rate of TAG breakdown back into DAG increases the influx into the DAG pool, raising its level.\n\n5.  **$k_{4}$ (TAG export rate constant)**: $k_{4}$ also appears in both numerator and denominator. The partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial M_{D}^{\\ast}}{\\partial k_{4}}$ has a sign determined by $-J_{L}k_{1}k_{3}$. This term is negative. Thus, $\\frac{\\partial M_{D}^{\\ast}}{\\partial k_{4}} < 0$. Increasing $k_{4}$ will decrease $M_{D}^{\\ast}$. The mechanism is indirect: increasing TAG export via VLDL ($k_{4}$) lowers the steady-state level of TAG ($M_{T}^{\\ast}$). This reduction in the TAG pool size reduces the substrate available for the reverse flux into DAG ($k_{3}M_{T}^{\\ast}$), thereby lowering $M_{D}^{\\ast}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{J_{L}(k_{3} + k_{4})}{k_{1}k_{4} + k_{2}k_{3} + k_{2}k_{4}}}\n$$", "id": "2591771"}]}
