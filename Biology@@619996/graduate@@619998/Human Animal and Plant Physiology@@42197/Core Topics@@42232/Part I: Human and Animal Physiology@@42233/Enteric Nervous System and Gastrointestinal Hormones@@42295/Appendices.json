This provides a clear, constrained system from which a logical deduction can be made.\n- **Objective:** The language is clinical and precise, devoid of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The provided principles are sufficient and consistent for deriving a solution. The distinction between local neural control (submucosal plexus) and systemic hormonal control is clearly articulated, as is the division of labor between the two nerve plexuses.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective question in physiology. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe problem requires predicting the consequences of an isolated lesion of the submucosal plexus in a $10\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ segment of the distal ileum. The analysis must address two components: epithelial transport and peristaltic propulsion.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Epithelial Water and Electrolyte Transport:**\n    - According to Principle 3, the submucosal plexus is the primary regulator of epithelial secretion and absorption. Specifically, secretomotor neurons within this plexus utilize neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine (ACh) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) to *stimulate* crypt secretion.\n    - As stated in Principle 2, this secretion is mediated primarily by the efflux of $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$ ions through the CFTR channel, which in turn drives the paracellular movement of $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ and, by osmosis (Principle 1), water ($J_w$) into the intestinal lumen.\n    - The injury described damages the submucosal plexus, thereby eliminating the primary local, reflex-driven stimulatory input to the secretory crypt cells. While a basal level of secretion may persist, the powerful, neurally-mediated amplification of secretion in response to luminal stimuli is lost.\n    - Concurrently, the absorptive processes in the villus/surface cells, which reclaim $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ (and thus water) from the lumen, remain functionally intact. These processes are not stated to be primarily dependent on stimulatory input from the submucosal plexus.\n    - The net effect of ablating the dominant stimulatory drive for secretion, while absorption continues, is a shift in the local transport balance toward net absorption. This results in a diminished flux of water ($J_w$) into the lumen and increased removal of water from the luminal contents. The luminal contents within this $10\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ segment will consequently become drier and more consolidated. Bicarbonate ($\\mathrm{HCO}_3^-$) is another major anion secreted by the intestine, often regulated by similar neural pathways; thus, its secretion would also be expected to decrease.\n    - Principle 4 confirms that circulating hormones cannot fully compensate for this local deficit, as rapid, spatially localized adjustments are the specific domain of the submucosal reflex circuits.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Peristaltic Propulsion:**\n    - According to Principle 3, the myenteric (Auerbach’s) plexus is the primary coordinator of the circular and longitudinal smooth muscle layers responsible for generating peristalsis.\n    - The problem explicitly states that the myenteric plexus is preserved and structurally intact.\n    - Therefore, the neural circuitry responsible for initiating and propagating the coordinated muscle contractions that constitute peristalsis is not directly affected by the injury. While some communication exists between the two plexuses, the fundamental motor patterns for propulsion will be maintained by the intact myenteric plexus.\n    - Consequently, peristaltic propulsion through the affected $10\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ segment is expected to remain largely preserved.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Net reduction of epithelial $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$ and $\\mathrm{HCO}_3^-$ secretion and diminished $J_w$ into the lumen in the affected $10\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ segment, predisposing to drier, harder luminal contents, while peristaltic propulsion remains largely preserved because myenteric motor circuits are intact.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with the derivation. It correctly identifies a reduction in secretion (both $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$ and $\\mathrm{HCO}_3^-$) and water flux ($J_w$) due to the loss of stimulatory submucosal neurons. It also correctly concludes that peristalsis is preserved due to the intact myenteric plexus.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Net increase in epithelial $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$ secretion causing secretory diarrhea localized to the $10\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ segment due to removal of inhibitory submucosal tone; propulsion is also preserved because myenteric circuits are intact.**\nThis option posits an increase in secretion. This contradicts Principle 3, which explicitly identifies the roles of ACh and VIP from submucosal neurons as *stimulatory* for secretion. Loss of a primary stimulatory pathway leads to hypo-secretion, not hyper-secretion. Secretory diarrhea results from excessive stimulation of secretion, the opposite of the condition described.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Little to no change in epithelial water-electrolyte transport, but marked impairment of peristaltic propulsion with risk of pseudo-obstruction across the $10\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ segment because the submucosal plexus is the primary controller of peristalsis.**\nThis option contains two fundamental errors. First, it incorrectly claims the submucosal plexus is the primary controller of peristalsis, directly contradicting Principle 3 which assigns this role to the myenteric plexus. Second, it incorrectly claims little change in transport, which ignores the primary role of the submucosal plexus in regulating secretion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. No significant change in either water-electrolyte handling or propulsion within the $10\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ segment because circulating gastrointestinal hormones (for example, secretin and aldosterone) fully compensate for loss of submucosal control of epithelial transport.**\nThis option claims full compensation by hormones. This directly contradicts Principle 4, which states that rapid, local adjustments depend on the submucosal plexus and cannot be perfectly replicated by slower, systemic hormonal signals. Therefore, a significant local change in transport is expected.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Reduced mucosal blood flow autoregulation in the $10\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ segment leading to a balanced decrease in both secretion and absorption such that net $J_w$ is unchanged, but peristalsis becomes hyperactive due to loss of submucosal inhibitory neurons.**\nThis option is flawed. While the submucosal plexus does regulate blood flow, the assumption of a \"balanced\" decrease in secretion and absorption leading to no net change in $J_w$ is unsubstantiated and unlikely. The most direct consequence is the loss of stimulated secretion. Furthermore, the claim of \"hyperactive\" peristalsis is not supported by the given principles; the myenteric plexus's function is to generate *coordinated* propulsion, and loss of input from the submucosal plexus does not have a clear basis for inducing hyperactivity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2565566"}, {"introduction": "Having established the distinct functional roles of the ENS plexuses, we now delve into the biophysical principles that govern signal propagation within the gut wall.

Assuming $V$ is constant, we have:\n$$ V \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = R_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) - R_{\\mathrm{out}}(t) $$\nThe elimination rate, $R_{\\mathrm{out}}(t)$, is modeled as being proportional to the plasma concentration, with the proportionality constant being the systemic clearance, $\\mathrm{CL}$.\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{out}}(t) = \\mathrm{CL} \\cdot C(t) $$\nThe secretion rate for $t \\ge 0$ is given as $R_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) = R_{b} + S_{0}k_{s}\\exp(-k_{s}t)$. The basal secretion rate $R_{b}$ maintains the basal concentration $C_{b}$ at steady state, so $R_{b} = \\mathrm{CL} \\cdot C_{b}$. Substituting these expressions into the mass balance equation:\n$$ V \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = (\\mathrm{CL} \\cdot C_{b} + S_{0}k_{s}\\exp(-k_{s}t)) - \\mathrm{CL} \\cdot C(t) $$\nRearranging the terms to form a standard linear first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$ V \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} + \\mathrm{CL} \\cdot C(t) = \\mathrm{CL} \\cdot C_{b} + S_{0}k_{s}\\exp(-k_{s}t) $$\nDividing by the volume of distribution $V$:\n$$ \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} + \\frac{\\mathrm{CL}}{V} C(t) = \\frac{\\mathrm{CL}}{V} C_{b} + \\frac{S_{0}k_{s}}{V}\\exp(-k_{s}t) $$\nUsing the definition of the elimination rate constant, $k_{e} = \\mathrm{CL}/V$:\n$$ \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} + k_{e}C(t) = k_{e}C_{b} + \\frac{S_{0}k_{s}}{V}\\exp(-k_{s}t) $$\nThis ODE describes the time course of the CCK concentration for $t \\ge 0$. The initial condition is that at $t=0$, the concentration is at its basal level, so $C(0) = C_{b}$.\n\nTo solve this ODE, it is convenient to define a new variable for the concentration change from baseline, $\\Delta C(t) = C(t) - C_{b}$. This implies $C(t) = \\Delta C(t) + C_{b}$ and $\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d\\Delta C(t)}{dt}$. The initial condition for this new variable is $\\Delta C(0) = C(0) - C_{b} = C_{b} - C_{b} = 0$. Substituting into the ODE:\n$$ \\frac{d\\Delta C(t)}{dt} + k_{e}(\\Delta C(t) + C_{b}) = k_{e}C_{b} + \\frac{S_{0}k_{s}}{V}\\exp(-k_{s}t) $$\n$$ \\frac{d\\Delta C(t)}{dt} + k_{e}\\Delta C(t) + k_{e}C_{b} = k_{e}C_{b} + \\frac{S_{0}k_{s}}{V}\\exp(-k_{s}t) $$\nThe term $k_{e}C_{b}$ cancels, simplifying the equation significantly:\n$$ \\frac{d\\Delta C(t)}{dt} + k_{e}\\Delta C(t) = \\frac{S_{0}k_{s}}{V}\\exp(-k_{s}t) $$\nThis is a standard first-order linear ODE with the initial condition $\\Delta C(0) = 0$. The solution is found using an integrating factor, $\\mu(t) = \\exp(\\int k_{e} dt) = \\exp(k_{e}t)$. Multiplying the ODE by $\\mu(t)$:\n$$ \\exp(k_{e}t)\\frac{d\\Delta C(t)}{dt} + k_{e}\\exp(k_{e}t)\\Delta C(t) = \\frac{S_{0}k_{s}}{V}\\exp(-k_{s}t)\\exp(k_{e}t) $$\nThe left side is the derivative of a product:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\left[\\Delta C(t)\\exp(k_{e}t)\\right] = \\frac{S_{0}k_{s}}{V}\\exp((k_{e}-k_{s})t) $$\nIntegrating both sides from $\\tau=0$ to $\\tau=t$, assuming $k_{e} \\neq k_{s}$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{d}{d\\tau}\\left[\\Delta C(\\tau)\\exp(k_{e}\\tau)\\right] d\\tau = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{S_{0}k_{s}}{V}\\exp((k_{e}-k_{s})\\tau) d\\tau $$\n$$ \\left[\\Delta C(\\tau)\\exp(k_{e}\\tau)\\right]_{0}^{t} = \\frac{S_{0}k_{s}}{V} \\left[\\frac{\\exp((k_{e}-k_{s})\\tau)}{k_{e}-k_{s}}\\right]_{0}^{t} $$\n$$ \\Delta C(t)\\exp(k_{e}t) - \\Delta C(0)\\exp(0) = \\frac{S_{0}k_{s}}{V(k_{e}-k_{s})} \\left(\\exp((k_{e}-k_{s})t) - 1\\right) $$\nSince $\\Delta C(0) = 0$:\n$$ \\Delta C(t)\\exp(k_{e}t) = \\frac{S_{0}k_{s}}{V(k_{e}-k_{s})} \\left(\\exp(k_{e}t)\\exp(-k_{s}t) - 1\\right) $$\nMultiplying by $\\exp(-k_{e}t)$ to solve for $\\Delta C(t)$:\n$$ \\Delta C(t) = \\frac{S_{0}k_{s}}{V(k_{e}-k_{s})} \\left(\\exp(-k_{s}t) - \\exp(-k_{e}t)\\right) $$\nThe full concentration profile $C(t)$ is obtained by adding the basal concentration back:\n$$ C(t) = C_{b} + \\Delta C(t) = C_{b} + \\frac{S_{0}k_{s}}{V(k_{e}-k_{s})} \\left(\\exp(-k_{s}t) - \\exp(-k_{e}t)\\right) $$\nNow, we calculate the required numerical values.\nFirst, the elimination rate constant $k_{e}$:\n$$ k_{e} = \\frac{\\mathrm{CL}}{V} = \\frac{2.773 \\, \\mathrm{L/min}}{10.0 \\, \\mathrm{L}} = 0.2773 \\, \\mathrm{min}^{-1} $$\nThe problem confirms that $k_{e} = 0.2773 \\, \\mathrm{min}^{-1} \\neq k_{s} = 0.100 \\, \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\nNext, we calculate the terms in the equation for $C(t)$ at $t=20.0 \\, \\mathrm{min}$.\nThe pre-factor term is:\n$$ \\frac{S_{0}k_{s}}{V(k_{e}-k_{s})} = \\frac{(500 \\, \\mathrm{pmol})(0.100 \\, \\mathrm{min}^{-1})}{(10.0 \\, \\mathrm{L})(0.2773 \\, \\mathrm{min}^{-1} - 0.100 \\, \\mathrm{min}^{-1})} = \\frac{50.0}{10.0 \\times 0.1773} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{pmol}}{\\mathrm{L}} = \\frac{5.00}{0.1773} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{pmol}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\approx 28.20079 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{pmol}}{\\mathrm{L}} $$\nThe exponential terms are:\n$$ \\exp(-k_{s}t) = \\exp(-0.100 \\times 20.0) = \\exp(-2.00) \\approx 0.135335 $$\n$$ \\exp(-k_{e}t) = \\exp(-0.2773 \\times 20.0) = \\exp(-5.546) \\approx 0.003903 $$\nThe difference of the exponentials is:\n$$ \\exp(-2.00) - \\exp(-5.546) \\approx 0.135335 - 0.003903 = 0.131432 $$\nNow we calculate $\\Delta C(t)$ at $t=20.0 \\, \\mathrm{min}$:\n$$ \\Delta C(20.0) \\approx 28.20079 \\times 0.131432 \\approx 3.7065 \\, \\mathrm{pmol/L} $$\nFinally, we calculate the total concentration $C(t)$ at $t=20.0 \\, \\mathrm{min}$:\n$$ C(20.0) = C_{b} + \\Delta C(20.0) = 2.00 \\, \\mathrm{pmol/L} + 3.7065 \\, \\mathrm{pmol/L} = 5.7065 \\, \\mathrm{pmol/L} $$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to three significant figures.\n$$ C(20.0) \\approx 5.71 \\, \\mathrm{pmol/L} $$\nThis is the plasma CCK concentration at $20.0$ minutes after the lipid load.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.71}$$", "id": "2565508"}]}
