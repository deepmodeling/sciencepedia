The values provided for membrane potential, reversal potential, and conductance are all within physiologically realistic ranges for a central nervous system neuron. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to calculate the initial current via a fundamental equation. It is not incomplete or contradictory; the request to evaluate the effect under current-clamp after calculating the current under a voltage-clamp is a standard pedagogical method to separate the properties of the synapse from its effect on the membrane. The problem is objective and lacks any form of ambiguity or non-formalizable components.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be constructed.\n\nThe flow of ions across a cell membrane through an open channel is governed by the principles of ohmic conduction, adapted for electrophysiology. The synaptic current, $I_{\\text{syn}}$, is the product of the synaptic conductance, $g_{\\text{syn}}$, and the electrochemical driving force. The driving force is the difference between the membrane potential, $V_m$, and the reversal potential (or Nernst potential) for the specific ion, $E_{\\text{ion}}$. The relationship is expressed as:\n$$I_{\\text{syn}} = g_{\\text{syn}} (V_m - E_{\\text{ion}})$$\nIn this problem, the synapse is mediated by GABA$_{\\text{A}}$ receptors, which are permeable to chloride ions ($\\text{Cl}^{-}$). Therefore, the specific equation for the current, $I_{\\text{GABA}}$, is:\n$$I_{\\text{GABA}} = g_{\\text{GABA}} (V_m - E_{\\text{Cl}})$$\nWe are asked to compute the initial synaptic current at time $t=0^{+}$, immediately after the conductance opens. The problem provides the necessary values:\n- $g_{\\text{GABA}} = 5\\ \\text{nS} = 5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{S}$\n- $V_{m} = -65\\ \\text{mV} = -65 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{V}$\n- $E_{\\text{Cl}} = -70\\ \\text{mV} = -70 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{V}$\n\nFirst, we compute the driving force, $(V_m - E_{\\text{Cl}})$:\n$$ \\text{Driving Force} = V_m - E_{\\text{Cl}} = (-65\\ \\text{mV}) - (-70\\ \\text{mV}) = -65\\ \\text{mV} + 70\\ \\text{mV} = +5\\ \\text{mV} $$\nThe driving force is $+5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{V}$. The positive sign indicates that the membrane potential is positive relative to the equilibrium potential for chloride.\n\nNow, we calculate the initial synaptic current, $I_{\\text{GABA}}$, by substituting the values into the equation:\n$$ I_{\\text{GABA}} = (5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{S}) \\times (+5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{V}) $$\n$$ I_{\\text{GABA}} = 25 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{A} $$\nThis is equivalent to $25\\ \\text{pA}$. The calculated current is positive. According to the stated sign convention, a positive current represents an outward flux of positive charge. Since the charge carriers are negative chloride ions, an outward flux of positive charge is equivalent to an inward flux of negative charge. This is consistent with the positive driving force, which pushes negative ions into the cell to make the membrane potential more negative, moving it from $-65\\ \\text{mV}$ toward the chloride equilibrium of $-70\\ \\text{mV}$.\n\nNext, we must determine if the resulting postsynaptic potential under current-clamp conditions would be hyperpolarizing or depolarizing. In a current-clamp experiment, the membrane potential is free to change in response to current injection. The calculated synaptic current, $I_{\\text{GABA}}$, is an inward current of negatively charged chloride ions. The influx of negative charge into the neuron's cytosol will cause the membrane potential to become more negative. A change in membrane potential to a more negative value is, by definition, a hyperpolarization.\n\nThe mechanistic justification is as follows: The resting membrane potential ($V_m = -65\\ \\text{mV}$) is depolarized relative to the chloride reversal potential ($E_{\\text{Cl}} = -70\\ \\text{mV}$). This creates an inwardly directed electrochemical gradient for chloride ions. When GABA$_{\\text{A}}$ channels open, chloride ions flow into the cell, down this gradient. The influx of anions adds net negative charge to the interior of the cell, driving the membrane potential away from its initial value and toward $E_{\\text{Cl}}$. Because this change makes the membrane potential more negative, the inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) is classified as hyperpolarizing.\n\nThe problem requires the numerical value of the initial current in picoamperes, rounded to three significant figures. The calculated current is exactly $25\\ \\text{pA}$. To express this with three significant figures, we write $25.0\\ \\text{pA}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{25.0}$$", "id": "2599710"}, {"introduction": "Neurons are dynamic processors, sensitive to the timing of incoming signals.

The voltage $V(t)$ across such a membrane, in the absence of input current after being charged to a certain potential, decays exponentially toward the resting potential (which we define as $0$ for convenience). This decay is governed by the differential equation:\n$$ \\tau \\frac{dV}{dt} + V = 0 $$\nwhere $\\tau = RC$ is the membrane time constant.\n\nA single excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) is modeled as an instantaneous event at time $t_i$ that increases the membrane potential by an amplitude $V_0$.

The second input occurs at $t=\\Delta t$. We must therefore analyze $V_{total}(t)$ for the interval $t \\ge \\Delta t$.
