Derivation and Calculation of Stroke Volume ($SV$)**\n\nThe stroke volume is, by definition, the volume of blood ejected from a ventricle during one contraction or \"stroke\" of the heart. The cardiac cycle consists of a filling phase (diastole) and an ejection phase (systole). The volume of blood in the ventricle at the end of diastole is the end-diastolic volume, $EDV$. The volume remaining in the ventricle at the end of systole is the end-systolic volume, $ESV$. The difference between these two volumes must therefore be the volume that was ejected.\n$$ SV = EDV - ESV $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ SV = 140\\,\\text{mL} - 70\\,\\text{mL} = 70\\,\\text{mL} $$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, the stroke volume is $70.0\\,\\text{mL}$.\n\n**2. Derivation and Calculation of Cardiac Output ($CO$)**\n\nCardiac output is defined as the total volume of blood pumped by a ventricle per unit time. This is a volumetric flow rate. The fundamental relationship connecting volume per beat (a discrete quantity) to volume per time (a continuous flow) is through the frequency of beats, which is the heart rate ($HR$). If the heart ejects a volume $SV$ with each beat, and there are $HR$ beats per minute, then the total volume ejected per minute is the product of the volume per beat and the number of beats per minute.\n$$ CO \\left[ \\frac{\\text{Volume}}{\\text{Time}} \\right] = SV \\left[ \\frac{\\text{Volume}}{\\text{Beat}} \\right] \\times HR \\left[ \\frac{\\text{Beats}}{\\text{Time}} \\right] $$\nUsing the calculated $SV$ and the given $HR$:\n$$ CO = 70\\,\\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{beat}} \\times 90\\,\\frac{\\text{beats}}{\\text{min}} = 6300\\,\\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}} $$\nThe problem requires the result in units of liters per minute ($\\text{L}\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$). Since $1\\,\\text{L} = 1000\\,\\text{mL}$:\n$$ CO = 6300\\,\\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\text{L}}{1000\\,\\text{mL}} = 6.3\\,\\frac{\\text{L}}{\\text{min}} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the cardiac output is $6.30\\,\\text{L}\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$.\n\n**3. Derivation and Calculation of Ejection Fraction ($EF$)**\n\nThe ejection fraction is a dimensionless measure of pumping efficiency. It is defined as the fraction of blood in the ventricle at the start of systole that is ejected during that systole. The volume at the start of systole is the end-diastolic volume ($EDV$), and the volume ejected is the stroke volume ($SV$). The ratio of the ejected volume to the initial volume gives this fraction.\n$$ EF = \\frac{SV}{EDV} $$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$ EF = \\frac{70\\,\\text{mL}}{140\\,\\text{mL}} = 0.5 $$\nAs a decimal rounded to three significant figures, the ejection fraction is $0.500$.\n\n**Physiological Interpretation**\n\nThe subject is in a supine, thermoneutral environment, conditions which are designed to approximate a basal metabolic state. We will evaluate the calculated values in this context.\n- **Stroke Volume ($SV = 70.0\\,\\text{mL}$):** This value falls within the typical resting range for a healthy adult, which is approximately $60-100\\,\\text{mL}$. This indicates that the volume of blood ejected per beat is normal.\n- **Cardiac Output ($CO = 6.30\\,\\text{L}\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$):** This value is also within the normal resting range of $4-8\\,\\text{L}\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$. The body's overall blood flow requirement is being met adequately.\n- **Ejection Fraction ($EF = 0.500$):** An ejection fraction of $0.50$ (or $50\\%$) is slightly below the typical lower limit of the normal range for a healthy, resting adult, which is generally considered to be $0.55-0.70$ ($55\\%-70\\%$). This suggests a mild reduction in ventricular contractile efficiency.\n\nThe apparent contradiction of a normal $CO$ despite a slightly low $EF$ is resolved by examining the heart rate. The given $HR$ of $90\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$ is at the higher end of the normal resting range ($60-100\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$) and would be classified as mild sinus tachycardia for a resting individual. This elevated heart rate compensates for the moderately low ejection efficiency to maintain a normal cardiac output.\n\nThe unifying regulatory mechanism is likely an elevated sympathetic nervous system tone. Sympathetic stimulation increases heart rate (positive chronotropy). It also typically increases contractility (positive inotropy), which would be expected to *increase* the $EF$. The fact that $EF$ is slightly low in the presence of a high $HR$ suggests that either the intrinsic contractility is somewhat impaired (as might be seen in a physically deconditioned individual), or the positive inotropic effect of the sympathetic drive is insufficient to overcome a high afterload (not measured) or the detrimental effects of reduced diastolic filling time at such a heart rate. The high $EDV$ of $140\\,\\text{mL}$ indicates that venous return (preload) is robust, which helps maintain $SV$ via the Frank-Starling mechanism. In summary, the physiological state is one of compensated, mild inefficiency: a high heart rate maintains adequate systemic blood flow despite a reduced pumping effectiveness per beat.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 70.0 & 6.30 & 0.500 \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "2603427"}, {"introduction": "While cardiac output can be defined by ventricular mechanics, it can also be determined from the perspective of the body's metabolic demands.
