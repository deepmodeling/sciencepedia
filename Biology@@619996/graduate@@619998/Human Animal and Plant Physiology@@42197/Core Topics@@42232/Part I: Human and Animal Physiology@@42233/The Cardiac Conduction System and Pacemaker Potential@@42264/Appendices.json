The provided physiological parameters, such as ion concentrations, temperature, and potential ranges, are standard for human cardiac pacemaker cells. The currents listed ($I_K$, $I_f$, $I_{Ca,L}$) are indeed the primary determinants of diastolic depolarization in the SA node. The principles to be used—the Nernst equation for equilibrium potentials and Ohm's law for ionic currents—are fundamental to electrophysiology. The problem is well-posed, asking for a qualitative but rigorous analysis of a defined physiological change. The language is objective and precise. The problem is not trivial, as it requires balancing multiple competing effects. All conditions for a valid problem are met.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\n1.  **Effect on Potassium Equilibrium Potential ($E_K$)**\n    The equilibrium potential for an ion is given by the Nernst equation:\n    $$E_{ion} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln \\frac{[ion]_o}{[ion]_i}$$\n    For potassium ($K^+$), the valence $z$ is $+1$. At human body temperature ($T = 37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} \\approx 310.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$), the term $\\frac{RT}{F}$ is approximately $26.7\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n    The change from normokalemia to hyperkalemia involves an increase in the extracellular potassium concentration, $[K^+]_o$. Since $[K^+]_o$ is in the numerator of the logarithm, increasing it will make the value of the logarithm less negative, and thus $E_K$ becomes less negative (depolarizes).\n    -   Normokalemia: $E_K \\propto \\ln\\left(\\frac{4}{140}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{35}\\right) \\approx -3.56$. Using the pre-factor $61.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ for base-10 logarithm, $E_K \\approx 61.5 \\log_{10}(4/140) \\approx -95.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n    -   Hyperkalemia: $E_K \\propto \\ln\\left(\\frac{7}{140}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{20}\\right) \\approx -3.00$. Using the pre-factor, $E_K \\approx 61.5 \\log_{10}(7/140) \\approx -80.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n    This confirms that increasing $[K^+]_o$ from $4\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ to $7\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ makes $E_K$ significantly less negative.\n\n2.  **Effect on Maximum Diastolic Potential (MDP)**\n    The problem states that the MDP is \"strongly influenced by potassium permeability\". This means that the MDP is primarily set by $E_K$, though it is slightly more depolarized than $E_K$ due to the presence of constant inward leak and the initial activation of the inward funny current, $I_f$. Because $E_K$ becomes less negative in hyperkalemia, the MDP must also become less negative. Thus, **moderate hyperkalemia depolarizes the maximum diastolic potential**.\n\n3.  **Effect on Potassium Current ($I_K$) Driving Force**\n    The potassium current is given by $I_K = g_K (V_m - E_K)$, where $g_K$ is the conductance and $(V_m - E_K)$ is the electrochemical driving force. During diastole, $V_m$ is typically above $E_K$, making the driving force positive and $I_K$ an outward (repolarizing or hyperpolarizing) current. With hyperkalemia, $E_K$ increases (e.g., from $-95.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ to $-80.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$). For any given membrane potential $V_m$ during diastole (e.g., $-60\\,\\mathrm{mV}$), the difference $(V_m - E_K)$ becomes smaller. Therefore, **moderate hyperkalemia reduces the outward driving force for $I_K$**.\n\n4.  **Effect on L-type Calcium Current ($I_{Ca,L}$) Availability**\n    The problem states that $I_{Ca,L}$ \"inactivates with depolarization\". This refers to voltage-dependent inactivation. The availability of the channel for opening is determined by the recovery from inactivation, which occurs at hyperpolarized potentials. Since hyperkalemia causes a depolarization of the MDP, the cell spends the entire diastolic interval at a more depolarized potential. This sustained depolarization reduces the removal of inactivation, meaning more $I_{Ca,L}$ channels remain in an inactivated state and are unavailable to contribute to the subsequent action potential or the late phase of diastolic depolarization. Thus, **moderate hyperkalemia increases inactivation of $I_{Ca,L}$**, reducing its availability.\n\n5.  **Effect on Funny Current ($I_f$) Recruitment**\n    The funny current, $I_f$, is defined as being activated by hyperpolarization. The extent of its activation, and therefore its magnitude, increases as the membrane potential becomes more negative. Since hyperkalemia depolarizes the MDP, the maximum hyperpolarization achieved during the cycle is reduced. This provides a weaker stimulus for the activation of $I_f$ channels. Consequently, the inward current $I_f$, which is the primary driver of diastolic depolarization, is **reduced**.\n\n6.  **Net Effect on Cycle Length**\n    The rate of diastolic depolarization ($dV/dt$) determines the time taken to reach the threshold from the MDP. This rate is proportional to the net membrane current, $\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{I_{inward} - I_{outward}}{C_m}$.\n    -   Inward currents ($I_f$, $I_{Ca,L}$) are **reduced**.\n    -   Outward current ($I_K$) is **reduced** (due to smaller driving force).\n    The slope of diastolic depolarization is determined by the competition between the reduction in inward currents and the reduction in outward current. The reduction of $I_f$ is a powerful effect, as it is the main \"pacemaker\" current. The reduction in available $I_{Ca,L}$ further diminishes the depolarizing drive. Although the opposing outward $I_K$ is also reduced, the dominant effect in moderate hyperkalemia is the slowing of depolarization due to the substantial decrease in the inward pacemaker currents.\n    A slower rate of depolarization will lengthen the time required to reach the threshold. This effect generally outweighs the fact that the voltage gap between the (now more depolarized) MDP and the threshold is smaller.\n    Therefore, the net result is a **slower diastolic depolarization** and a **longer cycle length** (bradycardia).\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. Moderate hyperkalemia depolarizes the maximum diastolic potential, reduces the outward driving force for $I_K$, and increases inactivation of $I_{Ca,L}$; the net effect is a longer cycle length because reduced $I_f$ recruitment and diminished $I_{Ca,L}$ availability outweigh the reduction in outward $I_K$.**\n    -   \"depolarizes the maximum diastolic potential\": **Correct**. As shown, this follows from the depolarization of $E_K$.\n    -   \"reduces the outward driving force for $I_K$\": **Correct**. Follows from the increase in $E_K$.\n    -   \"increases inactivation of $I_{Ca,L}$\": **Correct**. Follows from the depolarization of the MDP.\n    -   \"net effect is a longer cycle length\": **Correct**. Bradycardia is the expected outcome.\n    -   The reasoning provided is also **Correct**. The decrease in depolarizing currents, $I_f$ and $I_{Ca,L}$, is the dominant factor that slows the rate of diastolic depolarization. This statement is entirely consistent with our derivation.\n    Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n*   **B. Moderate hyperkalemia hyperpolarizes the maximum diastolic potential, increases the outward driving force for $I_K$, and decreases inactivation of $I_{Ca,L}$; the net effect is a shorter cycle length due to faster diastolic depolarization.**\n    -   \"hyperpolarizes the maximum diastolic potential\": **Incorrect**. Increased $[K^+]_o$ depolarizes $E_K$ and the MDP. The entire premise is flawed.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. Moderate hyperkalemia depolarizes the maximum diastolic potential, reduces the outward driving force for $I_K$, and decreases inactivation of $I_{Ca,L}$; the net effect is a shorter cycle length because the smaller voltage gap to threshold dominates.**\n    -   \"decreases inactivation of $I_{Ca,L}$\": **Incorrect**. The more depolarized MDP *increases* steady-state inactivation.\n    -   \"net effect is a shorter cycle length because the smaller voltage gap to threshold dominates\": **Incorrect**. The net effect is a longer cycle length, and the reasoning is flawed because the change in slope is the dominant factor.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D.
