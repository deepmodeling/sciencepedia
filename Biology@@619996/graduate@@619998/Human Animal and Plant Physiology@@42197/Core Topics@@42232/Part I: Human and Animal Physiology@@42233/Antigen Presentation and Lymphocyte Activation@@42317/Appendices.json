Consider the following experimentally grounded assumptions, which should be taken as the starting point for modeling and derivation.\n\n1. Under low-occupancy, non-saturating conditions, the mean number of pMHC per APC is proportional to the peptide dose, so that the expected number of independent T cell receptor (TCR)–pMHC binding attempts experienced by the T cell over the fixed assay duration scales linearly with the dose. Denote the peptide dose by $D$ (in nanomolar), and let the expected number of binding attempts be $s D$, where $s$ is a known scanning/encounter coefficient that incorporates pMHC loading and contact frequency.\n2. TCR–pMHC dissociation is a first-order process with off-rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, so that the dwell time is exponentially distributed. A kinetic proofreading step requires that a TCR–pMHC complex persist for at least a dwell time $t^{\\ast}$ to generate a productive signal.\n3. Each binding attempt independently yields a productive signal with probability equal to the probability that an exponential dwell time exceeds $t^{\\ast}$.
