A solution will be derived.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem from First Principles\n\n**1. Systemic Acid-Base Status of Both Patients:**\nBoth patients have a pH of $7.28$ (acidemia), a low plasma $\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}$ of $14$ $\\mathrm{mEq/L}$ (metabolic acidosis), and a low $pCO_2$ of $30$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$ (respiratory compensation).\n\n**2. Serum Anion Gap (SAG):**\nThe SAG is calculated as $[\\mathrm{Na^+}] - ([\\mathrm{Cl^-}] + [\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}])$.\n- **Patient X:** SAG = $138 - (112 + 14) = 138 - 126 = 12$ $\\mathrm{mEq/L}$.\n- **Patient Y:** SAG = $140 - (114 + 14) = 140 - 128 = 12$ $\\mathrm{mEq/L}$.\nBoth patients have a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (NAGMA), also known as hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. This is consistent with either bicarbonate loss (e.g., from the gastrointestinal tract) or impaired renal acid excretion.\n\n**3. The Urine Anion Gap (UAG) and its relation to Ammonium Excretion:**\nThe UAG is a surrogate measure for urinary ammonium ($\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$) excretion. From the principle of electroneutrality in urine:\n$$([\\mathrm{Na^+}]_{urine} + [\\mathrm{K^+}]_{urine} + [\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]_{urine} + \\text{Unmeasured Cations}) = ([\\mathrm{Cl^-}]_{urine} + [\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}]_{urine} + \\text{Unmeasured Anions})$$\nThe UAG is defined by the *measured* ions:\n$$UAG = ([\\mathrm{Na^+}]_{urine} + [\\mathrm{K^+}]_{urine}) - [\\mathrm{Cl^-}]_{urine}$$\nBy substituting from the electroneutrality equation, we get:\n$$UAG \\approx ([\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}]_{urine} + \\text{Unmeasured Anions}) - [\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]_{urine}$$\nIn metabolic acidosis, urinary $[\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}]_{urine}$ is negligible, and the concentration of unmeasured anions (sulfates, phosphates) is relatively stable. Therefore, the UAG becomes an inverse proxy for urinary ammonium:\n$$UAG \\approx (\\text{constant}) - [\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]_{urine}$$\nA high level of renal ammonium excretion (a robust renal response to acidosis) will result in a negative UAG. A low level of ammonium excretion (a poor renal response) will result in a zero or positive UAG.\n\n**4. Analysis of Patient X:**\n- Clinical context: Diarrhea, an extrarenal cause of NAGMA. The kidneys are expected to be functioning correctly and responding by increasing acid excretion.\n- Urine pH: $5.0$. This is maximally acidic and indicates intact distal tubular function, specifically the ability to secrete protons ($\\mathrm{H^+}$).\n- UAG calculation: UAG = $(20 + 15) - 90 = 35 - 90 = -55$ $\\mathrm{mEq/L}$.\n- Interpretation: The strongly negative UAG indicates a high concentration of urinary ammonium ($\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$), approximately $55$ $\\mathrm{mEq/L}$ plus the concentration of other unmeasured anions. This signifies a vigorous and appropriate renal response to the systemic metabolic acidosis, as expected when the kidney itself is not the cause of the acidosis. The excreted $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$ is accompanied by $\\mathrm{Cl^-}$, leading to high urinary chloride.\n\n**5. Analysis of Patient Y:**\n- Clinical context: Suspected impaired distal acidification (renal cause of NAGMA), consistent with distal Renal Tubular Acidosis (dRTA).\n- Urine pH: $6.5$. This is inappropriately alkaline for a patient with systemic acidosis. It demonstrates a failure of the distal nephron to secrete sufficient $\\mathrm{H^+}$ to acidify the urine.\n- UAG calculation: UAG = $(50 + 25) - 50 = 75 - 50 = +25$ $\\mathrm{mEq/L}$.\n- Interpretation: The positive UAG indicates a low concentration of urinary ammonium ($\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$). The inability to secrete $\\mathrm{H^+}$ into the tubular lumen impairs the \"trapping\" of diffusible ammonia ($\\mathrm{NH_3}$) as the non-diffusible ammonium ion ($\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$), thus severely limiting ammonium excretion. This is the characteristic defect in dRTA.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Patient X exhibits a negative urine anion gap, reflecting high urinary ammonium excretion accompanied predominantly by chloride, consistent with extrarenal bicarbonate loss due to diarrhea.**\nOur analysis for Patient X showed a UAG of $-55$ $\\mathrm{mEq/L}$. A negative UAG is indicative of high urinary ammonium excretion. In the renal response to systemic acidosis, the secreted $\\mathrm{H^+}$ combines with $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ to form $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$, which is then excreted with an anion, primarily $\\mathrm{Cl^-}$, as $\\mathrm{NH_4Cl}$. This entire picture is the classic physiological response to an extrarenal source of acidosis such as bicarbonate loss from diarrhea. The statement is fully supported by the data and principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Patient Y exhibits a positive urine anion gap and inappropriately high urine pH for the degree of systemic acidosis, indicating impaired ammonium excretion consistent with distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA).**\nOur analysis for Patient Y showed a UAG of $+25$ $\\mathrm{mEq/L}$ and a urine pH of $6.5$. The urine pH is indeed inappropriately high for the systemic acidosis (pH $7.28$). A positive UAG indicates low urinary ammonium excretion. This constellation of findings—NAGMA, inability to acidify the urine, and impaired ammonium excretion (evidenced by the positive UAG)—is the definition of distal RTA. The statement is factually correct and consistent with our analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The urine anion gap directly equals the urinary ammonium concentration regardless of which anion accompanies ammonium in the urine.**\nThis statement is incorrect. As derived previously, $UAG \\approx (\\text{Unmeasured Anions}) - [\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]_{urine}$. The UAG does not equal the ammonium concentration; rather, it is inversely related to it. A high ammonium concentration leads to a negative UAG. The statement proposes a direct equality, $UAG = [\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]$, which is fundamentally false in both its sign and its disregard for other unmeasured ions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. If Patient X instead had substantial urinary excretion of organic anions (for example, ketoanions), the urine anion gap would underestimate urinary ammonium excretion and could become positive despite high ammonium excretion.**\nLet us re-examine the UAG relationship: $UAG \\approx ([\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}]_{urine} + \\text{Unmeasured Anions}) - [\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]_{urine}$. \"Unmeasured Anions\" here refers to anions other than chloride. Ketoanions (e.g., beta-hydroxybutyrate) are a type of organic anion that would fall into this category. If there is substantial excretion of ketoanions, the term \"Unmeasured Anions\" becomes large. The excreted $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$ could be balanced by these ketoanions instead of by $\\mathrm{Cl^-}$. In such a case, the UAG could become positive (if $[\\text{Unmeasured Anions}]  [\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]$) even if ammonium excretion is high. A positive UAG would misleadingly suggest low ammonium excretion. Therefore, the UAG \"underestimates\" ammonium excretion in this scenario (more precisely, it becomes an invalid tool for estimation). This is why the UAG is only useful in non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, not in high anion gap states like ketoacidosis. The statement is physiologically correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Because net renal acid excretion equals urinary ammonium plus titratable acidity minus urinary bicarbonate, a negative urine anion gap in Patient X implies increased net renal acid excretion in the appropriate renal response to metabolic acidosis.**\nThe problem states the definition: NAE = $[\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]_{urine} + \\text{Titratable Acidity} - [\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}]_{urine}$. For Patient X, we found a negative UAG, which implies a high urinary $[\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]$. Since ammonium excretion is the major component of NAE during acidosis, a high $[\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]$ directly leads to a high NAE (urinary bicarbonate is negligible and titratable acidity also increases). Increased NAE is the definition of an appropriate renal response to metabolic acidosis. The logical chain presented in the statement is sound.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABDE}$$", "id": "2604698"}, {"introduction": "To achieve a truly deep understanding of renal physiology, we must move beyond applying established formulas to building predictive models from first principles.

The final excretion rate is defined as\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+}} = Q\\,[\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]_{\\mathrm{l}},\n$$\nwhich depends on the coupled acid-base speciation, diffusion, and advection.\n\nUnits and constants to use:\n- Use concentrations in $\\mathrm{mmol/L}$, volumetric flow in $\\mathrm{L/min}$, and all fluxes and rates (including $J_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}$, $F_{\\mathrm{in,tot}}$, $J_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+,\\;sec}}$, and $J_{\\mathrm{H^+}}$) in $\\mathrm{mmol/min}$. pH is dimensionless.\n- Use $pK_a = 9.15$ for the ammonium/ammonia pair.\n- Use interstitial pH $pH_{\\mathrm{i}} = 7.20$.\n- Use luminal baseline pH $pH_0 = 6.80$.\n- Use luminal pH bounds $pH_{\\min} = 4.40$ and $pH_{\\max} = 7.40$.\n- Use luminal buffer capacity $\\beta_{\\mathrm{l}} = 10.0\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L\\ per\\ pH\\ unit}$.\n\nRequired program behavior:\n- Implement the derived model to compute $E_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+}}$ for each test case below.\n- Express the final answer for each case in $\\mathrm{mmol/min}$, as a decimal number rounded to exactly $6$ decimal places.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., \"[0.001234,0.005678,0.000000]\") in the same order as the test cases.\n\nTest suite:\nEach test case provides the tuple of parameters $(Q,\\; J_{\\mathrm{H^+}},\\; T_{\\mathrm{i}},\\; F_{\\mathrm{in,tot}},\\; J_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+,\\;sec}},\\; K_{\\mathrm{perm}})$, where $T_{\\mathrm{i}}$ is the interstitial total ammonia species concentration.\n\n- Case A (general baseline): $(Q = 0.0012,\\; J_{\\mathrm{H^+}} = 0.020,\\; T_{\\mathrm{i}} = 10.0,\\; F_{\\mathrm{in,tot}} = 0.0030,\\; J_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+,\\;sec}} = 0.0000,\\; K_{\\mathrm{perm}} = 0.0100)$.\n- Case B (high acid load, modest flow): $(Q = 0.0008,\\; J_{\\mathrm{H^+}} = 0.060,\\; T_{\\mathrm{i}} = 20.0,\\; F_{\\mathrm{in,tot}} = 0.0020,\\; J_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+,\\;sec}} = 0.0000,\\; K_{\\mathrm{perm}} = 0.0100)$.\n- Case C (low acid load, higher flow): $(Q = 0.0015,\\; J_{\\mathrm{H^+}} = 0.005,\\; T_{\\mathrm{i}} = 5.0,\\; F_{\\mathrm{in,tot}} = 0.0015,\\; J_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+,\\;sec}} = 0.0000,\\; K_{\\mathrm{perm}} = 0.0100)$.\n- Case D (diuresis, intermediate acid load): $(Q = 0.0030,\\; J_{\\mathrm{H^+}} = 0.020,\\; T_{\\mathrm{i}} = 10.0,\\; F_{\\mathrm{in,tot}} = 0.0030,\\; J_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+,\\;sec}} = 0.0000,\\; K_{\\mathrm{perm}} = 0.0100)$.\n- Case E (very low flow, high acid load, added direct ammonium secretion): $(Q = 0.0003,\\; J_{\\mathrm{H^+}} = 0.060,\\; T_{\\mathrm{i}} = 15.0,\\; F_{\\mathrm{in,tot}} = 0.0010,\\; J_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+,\\;sec}} = 0.0005,\\; K_{\\mathrm{perm}} = 0.0100)$.\n\nDesign for coverage:\n- Case A is a typical steady state.\n- Case B probes stronger proton trapping and larger interstitial ammonia pool.\n- Case C probes reduced proton trapping with alkalinization tendency.\n- Case D probes high flow (diuresis) with intermediate acid load.\n- Case E probes very low flow with strong acid load and explicit ammonium secretion.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program must print exactly one line, containing a Python-style list string of the five predicted values of $E_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+}}$ in $\\mathrm{mmol/min}$, each rounded to exactly $6$ decimal places, in the order [Case A, Case B, Case C, Case D, Case E].", "solution": "The posed problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and provides all necessary information for a unique solution. It is based on established principles of renal physiology and physical chemistry, including mass balance, chemical equilibrium, and membrane transport. The parameters are within physiological ranges and all units are consistent. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a formal derivation of the solution will be presented.\n\nThe objective is to derive a closed-form analytical expression for the steady-state urinary ammonium excretion rate, denoted as $E_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+}}$. This quantity is defined as the product of the luminal volumetric flow rate, $Q$, and the luminal ammonium concentration, $[\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]_{\\mathrm{l}}$.\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+}} = Q\\,[\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]_{\\mathrm{l}}\n$$\nTo find $[\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]_{\\mathrm{l}}$, we must solve a system of coupled algebraic equations describing ammonia and ammonium transport and speciation in the medullary collecting duct.\n\nFirst, we determine the two key environmental parameters that are independent of the luminal ammonia concentrations: the final luminal $pH$, denoted $pH_{\\mathrm{l}}$, and the interstitial concentration of uncharged ammonia, $[\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$.\n\nThe luminal $pH$ ($pH_{\\mathrm{l}}$) is determined by the balance between a baseline state and the effect of proton secretion $J_{\\mathrm{H^+}}$. This is buffered by the luminal fluid with capacity $\\beta_{\\mathrm{l}}$ and diluted by the flow rate $Q$. The resulting $pH$ is physiologically constrained between $pH_{\\min}$ and $pH_{\\max}$.\n$$\npH_{\\mathrm{l}} = \\mathrm{clip}\\left(pH_0 - \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{H^+}}}{\\beta_{\\mathrm{l}}\\,Q},\\; pH_{\\min},\\; pH_{\\max}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $pH_0=6.80$, $\\beta_{\\mathrm{l}}=10.0\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$, $pH_{\\min}=4.40$, and $pH_{\\max}=7.40$.\n\nThe interstitial ammonia concentration, $[\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$, is determined from the total interstitial ammonia species concentration, $T_{\\mathrm{i}} = [\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{i}} + [\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$, and the interstitial $pH$, $pH_{\\mathrm{i}}$. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch relationship for the interstitium,\n$$\n[\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]_{\\mathrm{i}} = [\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{i}} \\cdot 10^{pK_a - pH_{\\mathrm{i}}}\n$$\nwe can substitute this into the expression for $T_{\\mathrm{i}}$:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{i}} = [\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{i}} \\left(1 + 10^{pK_a - pH_{\\mathrm{i}}}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for $[\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$ yields:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{i}} = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{i}}}{1 + 10^{pK_a - pH_{\\mathrm{i}}}}\n$$\nwhere $pK_a=9.15$ and $pH_{\\mathrm{i}}=7.20$.\n\nWith $pH_{\\mathrm{l}}$ and $[\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$ determined, we proceed to the core mass balance equation for total ammonia species in the lumen at steady state:\n$$\nQ\\,C_{\\mathrm{l,tot}} = F_{\\mathrm{in,tot}} + J_{\\mathrm{NH_3}} + J_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+,\\;sec}}\n$$\nHere, $C_{\\mathrm{l,tot}} = [\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{l}} + [\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]_{\\mathrm{l}}$ is the total luminal ammonia concentration, $F_{\\mathrm{in,tot}}$ is the total ammonia inflow rate, $J_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+,\\;sec}}$ is the direct ammonium secretion rate, and $J_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}$ is the diffusive flux of ammonia, given by:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{NH_3}} = K_{\\mathrm{perm}}\\left([\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{i}} - [\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{l}}\\right)\n$$\nIn the lumen, the speciation is governed by $pH_{\\mathrm{l}}$:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]_{\\mathrm{l}} = [\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{l}} \\cdot 10^{pK_a - pH_{\\mathrm{l}}}\n$$\nFor convenience, let $R_{\\mathrm{l}} = 10^{pK_a - pH_{\\mathrm{l}}}$. Then, $[\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]_{\\mathrm{l}} = R_{\\mathrm{l}} \\cdot [\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{l}}$, and the total luminal concentration is $C_{\\mathrm{l,tot}} = [\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{l}} (1 + R_{\\mathrm{l}})$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the mass balance equation:\n$$\nQ \\cdot [\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{l}} (1 + R_{\\mathrm{l}}) = F_{\\mathrm{in,tot}} + K_{\\mathrm{perm}}\\left([\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{i}} - [\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{l}}\\right) + J_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+,\\;sec}}\n$$\nThis is a linear equation for the unknown variable $[\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{l}}$. We can solve for it by rearranging terms:\n$$\nQ \\cdot [\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{l}} (1 + R_{\\mathrm{l}}) + K_{\\mathrm{perm}}[\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{l}} = F_{\\mathrm{in,tot}} + K_{\\mathrm{perm}}[\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{i}} + J_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+,\\;sec}}\n$$\n$$\n[\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{l}} \\left( Q(1 + R_{\\mathrm{l}}) + K_{\\mathrm{perm}} \\right) = F_{\\mathrm{in,tot}} + K_{\\mathrm{perm}}[\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{i}} + J_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+,\\;sec}}\n$$\nThus, the luminal ammonia concentration is:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{l}} = \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{in,tot}} + K_{\\mathrm{perm}}[\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{i}} + J_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+,\\;sec}}}{Q(1 + R_{\\mathrm{l}}) + K_{\\mathrm{perm}}}\n$$\nFrom this, we find the luminal ammonium concentration:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]_{\\mathrm{l}} = R_{\\mathrm{l}} \\cdot [\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{l}} = R_{\\mathrm{l}} \\cdot \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{in,tot}} + K_{\\mathrm{perm}}[\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{i}} + J_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+,\\;sec}}}{Q(1 + R_{\\mathrm{l}}) + K_{\\mathrm{perm}}}\n$$\nFinally, we can write the explicit formula for the ammonium excretion rate, $E_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+}}$:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+}} = Q \\cdot [\\mathrm{NH_4^+}]_{\\mathrm{l}} = Q \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{l}} \\cdot \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{in,tot}} + K_{\\mathrm{perm}}[\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{i}} + J_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+,\\;sec}}}{Q(1 + R_{\\mathrm{l}}) + K_{\\mathrm{perm}}}\n$$\n\nThe complete algorithm for calculation is as follows:\n1. For each test case defined by the tuple $(Q,\\; J_{\\mathrm{H^+}},\\; T_{\\mathrm{i}},\\; F_{\\mathrm{in,tot}},\\; J_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+,\\;sec}},\\; K_{\\mathrm{perm}})$, perform the following steps.\n2. Calculate the luminal $pH$, $pH_{\\mathrm{l}}$, using the clipping function.\n3. Calculate the luminal speciation ratio $R_{\\mathrm{l}} = 10^{pK_a - pH_{\\mathrm{l}}}$.\n4. Calculate the interstitial ammonia concentration $[\\mathrm{NH_3}]_{\\mathrm{i}} = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{i}}}{1 + 10^{pK_a - pH_{\\mathrm{i}}}}$.\n5. Substitute these intermediate values into the final expression for $E_{\\mathrm{NH_4^+}}$ to compute the result.\nThis provides the required closed-form algorithm to be implemented in the program.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the steady-state urinary ammonium excretion rate based on a\n    quantitative model of ammonium handling in the medullary collecting duct.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define constants based on the problem statement.\n    PK_A = 9.15\n    PH_I = 7.20\n    PH_0 = 6.80\n    PH_MIN = 4.40\n    PH_MAX = 7.40\n    BETA_L = 10.0  # mmol/L per pH unit\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case is a tuple: (Q, J_H, T_i, F_in_tot, J_NH4_sec, K_perm)\n    # Units:\n    # Q: L/min\n    # J_H, F_in_tot, J_NH4_sec: mmol/min\n    # T_i: mmol/L\n    # K_perm: L/min (since J=K*C implies mmol/L * L/min = mmol/min)\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A (general baseline)\n        (0.0012, 0.020, 10.0, 0.0030, 0.0000, 0.0100),\n        # Case B (high acid load, modest flow)\n        (0.0008, 0.060, 20.0, 0.0020, 0.0000, 0.0100),\n        # Case C (low acid load, higher flow)\n        (0.0015, 0.005, 5.0, 0.0015, 0.0000, 0.0100),\n        # Case D (diuresis, intermediate acid load)\n        (0.0030, 0.020, 10.0, 0.0030, 0.0000, 0.0100),\n        # Case E (very low flow, high acid load, added direct ammonium secretion)\n        (0.0003, 0.060, 15.0, 0.0010, 0.0005, 0.0100),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    # Pre-calculate the interstitial ratio factor, as it's constant\n    R_i = 10**(PK_A - PH_I)\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        Q, J_H, T_i, F_in_tot, J_NH4_sec, K_perm = case\n\n        # Step 1: Calculate luminal pH, pH_l\n        # The term J_H / (BETA_L * Q) represents the pH shift\n        ph_l_uncapped = PH_0 - J_H / (BETA_L * Q)\n        ph_l = np.clip(ph_l_uncapped, PH_MIN, PH_MAX)\n\n        # Step 2: Calculate the luminal pH-dependent ratio factor, R_l\n        R_l = 10**(PK_A - ph_l)\n\n        # Step 3: Calculate interstitial ammonia concentration, [NH3]_i\n        # T_i = [NH3]_i + [NH4+]_i = [NH3]_i * (1 + R_i)\n        conc_nh3_i = T_i / (1 + R_i)\n\n        # Step 4: Calculate components of the final derived formula for E_NH4+\n        \n        # Numerator of the [NH3]_l fraction:\n        # F_in_tot + K_perm*[NH3]_i + J_NH4_sec\n        numerator_term = F_in_tot + K_perm * conc_nh3_i + J_NH4_sec\n        \n        # Denominator of the [NH3]_l fraction:\n        # Q*(1 + R_l) + K_perm\n        denominator_term = Q * (1 + R_l) + K_perm\n        \n        # Step 5: Calculate the final excretion rate, E_NH4+\n        # E_NH4+ = Q * [NH4+]_l = Q * R_l * [NH3]_l\n        # E_NH4+ = Q * R_l * (numerator / denominator)\n        E_NH4_plus = Q * R_l * (numerator_term / denominator_term)\n        \n        results.append(E_NH4_plus)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # The results must be rounded to exactly 6 decimal places.\n    formatted_results = [f'{r:.6f}' for r in results]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2604748"}]}
