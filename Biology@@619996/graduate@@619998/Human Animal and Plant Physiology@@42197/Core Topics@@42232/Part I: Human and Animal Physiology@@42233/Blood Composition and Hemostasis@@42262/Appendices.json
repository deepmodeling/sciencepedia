It is a well-posed problem grounded in established physiological principles, namely the definitions of blood components and the law of conservation of volume. The assumptions, such as instantaneous mixing and no transcapillary fluid shifts, are standard idealizations for constructing a first-principles model of hemodilution. We shall therefore proceed to the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of expressions for the initial plasma volume, which we denote as $V_p$, and the change in hematocrit, $\\Delta Hct$.\n\nFirst, we address the initial plasma volume, $V_p$. The total blood volume, $V_b$, is the sum of the volume of its cellular components, primarily the red blood cell volume, $V_{\\mathrm{RBC}}$, and the plasma volume, $V_p$.\n$$V_b = V_{\\mathrm{RBC}} + V_p$$\nHematocrit, $Hct$, is defined as the volume fraction of red blood cells in whole blood:\n$$Hct = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{RBC}}}{V_b}$$\nFrom this definition, we can express the red blood cell volume as a function of total blood volume and hematocrit:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{RBC}} = Hct \\cdot V_b$$\nBy substituting this expression for $V_{\\mathrm{RBC}}$ into the equation for total blood volume, we can solve for the initial plasma volume $V_p$:\n$$V_p = V_b - V_{\\mathrm{RBC}} = V_b - (Hct \\cdot V_b)$$\nFactoring out $V_b$, we arrive at the first required expression:\n$$V_p = V_b (1 - Hct)$$\nThis is the expression for the initial plasma volume.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the change in hematocrit, $\\Delta Hct$. We define the initial state with the subscript \"before\" and the state after infusion with the subscript \"after\". The change is defined as:\n$$\\Delta Hct = Hct_{\\mathrm{after}} - Hct_{\\mathrm{before}}$$\nThe problem's given $Hct$ is $Hct_{\\mathrm{before}}$. We need to find $Hct_{\\mathrm{after}}$. By definition:\n$$Hct_{\\mathrm{after}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{RBC, after}}}{V_{b, \\mathrm{after}}}$$\nAccording to the problem's explicit assumptions, the red blood cell volume remains constant, so $V_{\\mathrm{RBC, after}} = V_{\\mathrm{RBC, before}}$. We can express this using the initial parameters as $V_{\\mathrm{RBC, before}} = Hct_{\\mathrm{before}} \\cdot V_{b, \\mathrm{before}}$.\nThe infused crystalloid volume, $\\Delta V$, is assumed to distribute only into the plasma. Therefore, the total blood volume after infusion is the sum of the initial blood volume and the infused volume:\n$$V_{b, \\mathrm{after}} = V_{b, \\mathrm{before}} + \\Delta V$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $Hct_{\\mathrm{after}}$ and using the simpler notation $Hct$ for $Hct_{\\mathrm{before}}$ and $V_b$ for $V_{b, \\mathrm{before}}$ as given in the problem statement:\n$$Hct_{\\mathrm{after}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{RBC, before}}}{V_{b, \\mathrm{after}}} = \\frac{Hct \\cdot V_b}{V_b + \\Delta V}$$\nNow, we can compute the change, $\\Delta Hct$:\n$$\\Delta Hct = Hct_{\\mathrm{after}} - Hct = \\frac{Hct \\cdot V_b}{V_b + \\Delta V} - Hct$$\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator:\n$$\\Delta Hct = \\frac{Hct \\cdot V_b - Hct (V_b + \\Delta V)}{V_b + \\Delta V} = \\frac{Hct \\cdot V_b - Hct \\cdot V_b - Hct \\cdot \\Delta V}{V_b + \\Delta V}$$\nThis simplifies to the second required expression:\n$$\\Delta Hct = - \\frac{Hct \\cdot \\Delta V}{V_b + \\Delta V}$$\n\nWith the derived expressions, we now evaluate them for the specific values provided: $V_b = 5.2\\ \\text{L}$, $Hct = 0.44$, and $\\Delta V = 0.80\\ \\text{L}$.\n\nThe initial plasma volume $V_p$ is calculated as:\n$$V_p = (5.2\\ \\text{L})(1 - 0.44) = (5.2\\ \\text{L})(0.56) = 2.912\\ \\text{L}$$\nThe problem requires this result to four significant figures.

The crucial simplifying assumption that prothrombin synthesis does not deplete its cofactor pool ensures the problem is self-contained and analytically tractable. The problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in a sequence of logical steps to determine the fraction of undercarboxylated prothrombin.\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless inhibition factor, $\\alpha$, which quantifies the effect of the competitive inhibitor warfarin, $[W]$, on the VKOR enzyme.\n$$\n\\alpha = 1 + \\frac{[W]}{K_{i}} = 1 + \\frac{0.10}{0.010} = 1 + 10 = 11\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the steady-state production rate of reduced vitamin K, $v_{\\mathrm{prod}}$, using the Michaelis-Menten equation modified for competitive inhibition.\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{prod}} = \\frac{V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{VKOR}} [K]}{\\alpha K_{m}^{\\mathrm{VKOR}} + [K]} = \\frac{(0.30)(0.50)}{(11)(0.50) + 0.50} = \\frac{0.15}{5.5 + 0.5} = \\frac{0.15}{6.0} = 0.025 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{M} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n\nThe steady-state concentration of reduced vitamin K, $[\\mathrm{KH}_{2}]$, is determined by the balance between its production, $v_{\\mathrm{prod}}$, and its first-order consumption, with rate constant $k_{\\deg}$.\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{prod}} = k_{\\deg} [\\mathrm{KH}_{2}]\n$$\nSolving for $[\\mathrm{KH}_{2}]$:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{KH}_{2}] = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{prod}}}{k_{\\deg}} = \\frac{0.025}{0.10} = 0.25 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{M}\n$$\n\nWith the steady-state cofactor concentration $[\\mathrm{KH}_{2}]$ determined, we can find the effective catalytic rate per residue, $k_{\\mathrm{cat,eff}}$, for the $\\gamma$-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX).

To ensure accuracy in the metric calculations, the solution is evaluated and stored at a fine-grained set of time points.\n\n3.  **Metric Calculation**: From the resulting thrombin concentration time series, $T(t_i)$, the three required metrics are computed for each $f_{\\text{VIII}}$ case using standard numerical methods.\n\n4.  **Output Formatting**: The three computed metrics ($\\tau_{\\text{lag}}$, $T_{\\text{peak}}$, ETP) for each case are rounded to three significant figures as specified and assembled into the final list structure.\n\nThe complete, runnable Python code to generate the answer is provided below.\n```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the thrombin generation ODE system and computes key metrics.\n    \"\"\"\n    def format_3sf(num):\n        \"\"\"Formats a number to 3 significant figures in decimal notation.\"\"\"\n        if num == 0: return \"0.00\"\n        if np.isinf(num) or np.isnan(num): return str(num)\n        magnitude = int(np.floor(np.log10(abs(num))))\n        precision = 2 - magnitude\n        if precision >= 0:\n            return f\"{num:.{precision}f}\"\n        else: # Large numbers\n            return str(int(round(num, precision)))\n\n    # Define model parameters\n    k_ext = 0.001       # nM/s\n    k_fb = 0.01         # 1/s\n    k_degX = 0.05       # 1/s\n    k_eff = 0.3         # 1/s\n    K_m = 500.0         # nM\n    k_inh = 0.02        # 1/s\n\n    # Define initial conditions and simulation settings\n    y0 = [1400.0, 0.0, 0.0]  # [P(0), T(0), X(0)] in nM\n    t_max = 2000.0          # s\n    T_th = 10.0             # nM\n\n    def thrombin_model(t, y, f_VIII):\n        \"\"\"\n        Defines the system of ordinary differential equations for thrombin generation.\n        State vector y is [P, T, X].\n        \"\"\"\n        P, T, X = y\n        \n        # Velocity of prothrombin activation\n        v_pro = k_eff * X * P / (K_m + P)\n        \n        # Derivatives\n        dP_dt = -v_pro\n        dT_dt = v_pro - k_inh * T\n        dX_dt = k_ext + k_fb * f_VIII * T - k_degX * X\n        \n        return [dP_dt, dT_dt, dX_dt]\n\n    # Define the factor VIII activity levels to test\n    test_cases = [1.0, 0.5, 0.1, 0.01, 0.0]\n    \n    # Time points for evaluation to ensure metric accuracy\n    t_eval = np.linspace(0, t_max, 20001)\n\n    results = []\n    for f_VIII in test_cases:\n        # Numerically solve the ODE system\n        sol = solve_ivp(\n            fun=thrombin_model,\n            t_span=[0, t_max],\n            y0=y0,\n            method='RK45',\n            t_eval=t_eval,\n            args=(f_VIII,)\n        )\n        \n        times = sol.t\n        T_sol = sol.y[1] # Thrombin concentration time course\n\n        # 1.
