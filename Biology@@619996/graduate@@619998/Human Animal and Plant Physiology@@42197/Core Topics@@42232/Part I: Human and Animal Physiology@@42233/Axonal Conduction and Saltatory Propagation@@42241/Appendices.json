It is scientifically grounded in the principles of biophysical modeling of neurons, specifically cable theory. The definitions, parameters, and objectives are well-posed, objective, and internally consistent, allowing for a rigorous derivation and calculation.\n\nWe begin by establishing the geometry of the system. The axon is modeled as a right circular cylinder of radius $a$. The problem asks for per-unit-length parameters. Consider a differential segment of the axon of length $\\Delta z$. The lateral surface area of this cylindrical segment is given by $A = 2\\pi a \\Delta z$.

For the segment of length $\\Delta z$, the membrane conductance is:\n$$G_{\\Delta z} = g_m \\times A = g_m (2\\pi a \\Delta z)$$\nThe membrane elements are connected in parallel along the length of the axon.

The radius is increased from an initial value $a$ to a new value $a' = 1.2a$. We are asked to compute the ratio of the new quantity to the old quantity for each of the six items. Let a quantity of interest be denoted by $Q$. We seek to find the ratio $Q'/Q$, where $Q'$ is the value of the quantity when the radius is $a'$, and $Q$ is the value when the radius is $a$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the unmyelinated axon. The problem states that the specific material properties—specific axial resistivity $\\rho_{i}$, specific membrane resistivity $R_{m}$, and specific membrane capacitance $C_{m}$—are constant.\n\n1.  **Unmyelinated Length Constant ($\\lambda_{\\mathrm{un}}$):**\n    The length constant is defined as $\\lambda = \\sqrt{r_{m}/r_{i}}$. The resistance per unit length for the membrane, $r_{m}$, and the axoplasm, $r_{i}$, are given by:\n    $$r_{m} = \\frac{R_{m}}{2\\pi a}$$\n    $$r_{i} = \\frac{\\rho_{i}}{\\pi a^{2}}$$\n    Substituting these into the expression for $\\lambda$:\n    $$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{un}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m}/(2\\pi a)}{\\rho_{i}/(\\pi a^{2})}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m}\\pi a^{2}}{2\\pi a \\rho_{i}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m}}{2\\rho_{i}} a}$$\n    Since $R_{m}$ and $\\rho_{i}$ are constants, we find the scaling relationship $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{un}} \\propto \\sqrt{a}$.

Substituting this into the expression for $r_{m,\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n    $$r_{m,\\mathrm{eff}} \\propto \\frac{a}{a} = a^{0}$$\n    This shows that $r_{m,\\mathrm{eff}}$ is independent of the radius $a$.

Combining these gives the scaling for the time constant:\n    $$\\tau_{m,\\mathrm{eff}} \\propto a \\cdot a^{-1} = a^{0}$$\n    The effective internodal time constant is independent of the axon radius. The ratio is therefore:\n    $$\\frac{\\tau'_{m, \\mathrm{eff}}}{\\tau_{m, \\mathrm{eff}}} = 1$$\n\n6.  **Myelinated Conduction Velocity ($v_{\\mathrm{my}}$):**\n    The problem states that for saltatory propagation, conduction velocity scales with the internode length, $v_{\\mathrm{my}} \\propto L$.
