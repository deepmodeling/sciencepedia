A rigorous solution will now be provided.\n\n---\n\n**1) Derivation of the Strength-Duration Relationship**\n\nWe begin with the given differential equation for the membrane potential $V(t)$:\n$$C_{m}\\,\\frac{dV}{dt}+\\frac{V}{R_{m}}=I$$\nThis equation is valid for the duration of the current pulse, $0 \\le t \\le t_{p}$. We divide by $C_{m}$ and introduce the membrane time constant $\\tau_{m} = R_{m}C_{m}$:\n$$\\frac{dV}{dt}+\\frac{V}{\\tau_{m}}=\\frac{I}{C_{m}}$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. The homogeneous solution is $V_h(t) = A\\exp(-t/\\tau_m)$. A particular solution for a constant forcing term is the steady-state voltage, $V_{ss}$, which is found by setting $\\frac{dV}{dt}=0$:\n$$\\frac{V_{ss}}{R_{m}} = I \\implies V_{ss} = I R_m$$\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions:\n$$V(t) = I R_{m} + A\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{m}}\\right)$$\nWe determine the integration constant $A$ using the initial condition $V(0)=0$:\n$$V(0) = 0 = I R_{m} + A\\exp(0) \\implies A = -I R_{m}$$\nSubstituting $A$ back into the general solution yields the voltage evolution during the pulse:\n$$V(t) = I R_{m} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{m}}\\right)\\right)$$\nAn action potential is triggered if the voltage at the end of the pulse, $V(t_{p})$, reaches the threshold $\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}$. For a current just at the threshold amplitude, $I = I_{\\text{th}}(t_{p})$, this condition is met exactly:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{th}} = V(t_{p}) = I_{\\text{th}}(t_{p}) R_{m} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{p}}{\\tau_{m}}\\right)\\right)$$\nSolving for the threshold current $I_{\\text{th}}(t_{p})$ gives the strength-duration relationship:\n$$I_{\\text{th}}(t_{p}) = \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}}{R_{m}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{p}}{\\tau_{m}}\\right)\\right)}$$\n\n**2) Expression for Rheobase ($I_r$) and Chronaxie ($t_c$)**\n\nThe rheobase, $I_{r}$, is the threshold current for an infinitely long pulse ($t_{p} \\to \\infty$). In this limit, the exponential term vanishes:\n$$I_{r} = \\lim_{t_{p}\\to\\infty} I_{\\text{th}}(t_{p}) = \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}}{R_{m}\\left(1 - 0\\right)} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}}{R_{m}}$$\nThe chronaxie, $t_{c}$, is the pulse duration $t_{p}$ for which the threshold current is twice the rheobase, $I_{\\text{th}}(t_{c}) = 2I_{r}$. Substituting the expressions for $I_{\\text{th}}$ and $I_{r}$:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}}{R_{m}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{c}}{\\tau_{m}}\\right)\\right)} = 2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}}{R_{m}}\\right)$$\nWe cancel the common term $\\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}}{R_{m}}$ from both sides (assuming $\\Delta V_{\\text{th}} \\neq 0$ and $R_{m}$ is finite and non-zero):\n$$\\frac{1}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{c}}{\\tau_{m}}\\right)} = 2$$\n$$1 = 2 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{c}}{\\tau_{m}}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{c}}{\\tau_{m}}\\right)$$\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{c}}{\\tau_{m}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-\\frac{t_{c}}{\\tau_{m}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\ln(2)$$\n$$t_{c} = \\tau_{m}\\ln(2)$$\n\n**3) Estimation of $I_{r}$, $\\tau_{m}$, and $t_{c}$ from Data**\n\nThe strength-duration relationship can be written in terms of the rheobase $I_{r}$:\n$$I_{\\text{th}}(t_{p}) = \\frac{I_{r}}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{p}}{\\tau_{m}}\\right)}$$\nWe are given two data points:\n1. $I_{1} = 20.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A}$ at $t_{1} = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{ms}$\n2. $I_{2} = 11.43\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A}$ at $t_{2} = 3.00\\,\\mathrm{ms}$\n\nThis forms a system of two nonlinear equations for the two unknowns, $I_{r}$ and $\\tau_{m}$:\n$$20.0 = \\frac{I_{r}}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1.00}{\\tau_{m}}\\right)}$$\n$$11.43 = \\frac{I_{r}}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3.00}{\\tau_{m}}\\right)}$$\nWe can express $I_{r}$ from both equations:\n$$I_{r} = 20.0 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1.00}{\\tau_{m}}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$I_{r} = 11.43 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3.00}{\\tau_{m}}\\right)\\right)$$\nEquating these two expressions for $I_{r}$:\n$$20.0 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1.00}{\\tau_{m}}\\right)\\right) = 11.43 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3.00}{\\tau_{m}}\\right)\\right)$$\nLet $x = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1.00}{\\tau_{m}}\\right)$. Then $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{3.00}{\\tau_{m}}\\right) = \\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1.00}{\\tau_{m}}\\right)\\right)^3 = x^3$. The equation becomes:\n$$20.0(1 - x) = 11.43(1 - x^3)$$\nUsing the identity $1 - x^3 = (1 - x)(1 + x + x^2)$:\n$$20.0(1 - x) = 11.43(1 - x)(1 + x + x^2)$$\nSince $\\tau_{m} > 0$, $x = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1.00}{\\tau_{m}}\\right)$ is strictly between $0$ and $1$, so $1-x \\neq 0$. We can divide both sides by $(1 - x)$:\n$$20.0 = 11.43(1 + x + x^2)$$\n$$x^2 + x + 1 - \\frac{20.0}{11.43} = 0$$\nThis is a quadratic equation: $11.43x^2 + 11.43x - 8.57 = 0$.

Therefore, the parameters are indeed $I_{r}=10.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A}$ and $t_c=1.00\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\nThe time constant is $\\tau_{m} = \\frac{t_{c}}{\\ln(2)} = \\frac{1.00}{\\ln(2)} \\approx 1.443\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\nThe chronaxie is $t_c = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\n**4) Biophysical Meaning of $I_r$ and $t_c$**\n\n- The **rheobase**, $I_r = \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}}{R_m}$, represents the minimum current amplitude required to reach the voltage threshold, achievable only with a current pulse of infinite duration. It is a measure of the steady-state excitability. A lower $I_r$ indicates a more excitable neuron. $I_r$ is inversely proportional to the membrane resistance $R_m$. An increase in $R_m$ (e.g., by closing resting leak channels) reduces the current leakage across the membrane, so a smaller injected current is sufficient to depolarize the membrane to threshold. This decreases $I_r$, increasing excitability. Conversely, decreasing $R_m$ increases $I_r$. $I_r$ is independent of membrane capacitance $C_m$, as $C_m$ only affects the rate of voltage change, not the final steady-state voltage.\n\n- The **chronaxie**, $t_c = \\tau_m \\ln(2) = R_m C_m \\ln(2)$, represents the pulse duration required for a stimulus of twice the rheobasic strength to be effective. It is a measure of the temporal characteristics of excitability, reflecting how quickly the membrane can respond to a stimulus. A shorter $t_c$ indicates a faster-responding, more readily excitable membrane for brief stimuli. $t_c$ is directly proportional to the membrane time constant $\\tau_m$. An increase in either $R_m$ or $C_m$ will increase $\\tau_m$ and thus increase $t_c$. A larger $R_m$ slows the dissipation of charge, while a larger $C_m$ requires more charge to achieve the same potential change; both factors slow the membrane's voltage response and lengthen the chronaxie.\n\nThe problem asks only for the numerical value of the chronaxie $t_c$ from part (3), rounded to three significant figures.

The goal is to design a set of voltage-clamp protocols to determine key parameters of the model: the leak conductance ($g_L$), the reversal potentials for sodium ($E_{Na}$) and potassium ($E_K$), and the voltage-dependence of the steady-state gating variables for sodium activation ($m_{\\infty}(V)$), sodium inactivation ($h_{\\infty}(V)$), and potassium activation ($n_{\\infty}(V)$). The provided tools and assumptions—voltage clamp, specific pharmacological blockers (TTX and TEA), known ionic activities, leak subtraction, and negligible calcium currents—are standard and sufficient for this task. The problem statement is therefore scientifically sound, well-posed, and free of contradictions.\n\nThe total ionic current ($I_{ion}$) under the Hodgkin-Huxley framework is given by the sum of the sodium, potassium, and leak currents:\n$$I_{ion} = I_{Na} + I_{K} + I_{L}$$\nThese components are defined as:\n$$I_{Na} = \\bar{g}_{Na} m^3 h (V - E_{Na})$$\n$$I_{K} = \\bar{g}_{K} n^4 (V - E_{K})$$\n$$I_{L} = g_{L} (V - E_{L})$$\nwhere $\\bar{g}_{Na}$ and $\\bar{g}_{K}$ are the maximal conductances, $g_{L}$ is the leak conductance, $V$ is the membrane potential, and $E_{ion}$ are the Nernst reversal potentials. The gating variables $m$, $h$, and $n$ represent probabilities and their steady-state values ($m_{\\infty}$, $h_{\\infty}$, $n_{\\infty}$) as a function of voltage are the target of measurement. A valid protocol must correctly isolate each current component and use appropriate voltage steps to measure the parameters.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option.\n\n**Option A Evaluation**\n- **$g_{L}$ determination**: This protocol proposes measuring the current-voltage ($I$-$V$) relationship in a voltage range where voltage-gated channels are expected to be closed (e.g., steps from $-80\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ to more negative potentials). In this range, the membrane current is dominated by the leak current $I_{L} = g_{L}(V - E_{L})$. The slope of the $I$-$V$ curve, $dI/dV$, is therefore an excellent measure of $g_{L}$. This is a standard and correct method.\n- **$E_{Na}$ determination**: The protocol describes using TEA to block potassium channels, thereby isolating the sodium current. It then employs a classic tail-current protocol. A prepulse to $-120\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ removes inactivation (sets $h \\approx 1$), a brief depolarization to $0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ activates the channels (opens $m$ gates), and subsequent steps to various test potentials are used to measure the instantaneous current. This instantaneous current, $I_{tail}$, is given by $I_{tail} = g_{Na}(V_{test} - E_{Na})$, where $g_{Na}$ is the large, fixed conductance at the moment of the voltage step. The voltage $V_{test}$ at which $I_{tail} = 0$ is, by definition, $E_{Na}$. This is the most accurate method for determining a reversal potential. The mention of leak subtraction and junction potential correction confirms a rigorous approach. This is correct.\n- **$E_{K}$ determination**: This applies the same tail-current logic to the potassium current. TTX is used to block sodium channels. A long depolarizing pulse activates potassium channels (opens $n$ gates). The reversal potential is then found by stepping to various tail potentials and identifying the voltage where the instantaneous tail current is zero. This is correct. The alternative suggestion of using the zero-crossing of the steady-state $I$-$V$ curve is theoretically possible for a non-inactivating current like $I_K$, but it is often less precise because the K$^{+}$ conductance is very low near the typical $E_K$ (around $-90\\,\\mathrm{mV}$). However, the primary proposed method is sound. This is correct.\n- **$m_{\\infty}(V)$ determination**: The protocol correctly proposes to isolate $I_{Na}$ with TEA, remove inactivation with a hyperpolarizing prepulse, and then measure the peak inward current $I_{Na,peak}$ over a range of test potentials $V$. The peak current is a good approximation for the current when activation ($m$) is maximal for that voltage and inactivation ($h$) has not yet become significant. The peak conductance is calculated as $g_{Na,peak}(V) = I_{Na,peak}(V) / (V - E_{Na})$. Normalizing this to its maximum value gives $g_{Na,peak}(V)/g_{Na,max} \\approx m_{\\infty}^3(V)$. From this, $m_{\\infty}(V)$ can be determined by taking the cube root. This is the standard, correct procedure.\n- **$h_{\\infty}(V)$ determination**: This describes the standard two-pulse protocol for measuring steady-state inactivation. A long conditioning prepulse to a voltage $V_{cond}$ sets the level of inactivation to $h_{\\infty}(V_{cond})$. A subsequent test pulse measures the fraction of channels available to open. By normalizing the peak current from the test pulse to the maximum peak current (obtained after a prepulse to a very negative potential where $h_{\\infty} \\approx 1$), one directly obtains the curve $h_{\\infty}(V)$. This must be done in TEA to isolate $I_{Na}$. This is correct.\n- **$n_{\\infty}(V)$ determination**: The protocol correctly proposes to isolate $I_{K}$ with TTX and measure the steady-state current $I_{K,ss}$ from long voltage steps. The steady-state conductance is $g_{K,ss}(V) = I_{K,ss}(V) / (V - E_{K})$. Normalizing this by the maximal potassium conductance gives $g_{K,ss}(V)/\\bar{g}_{K} = n_{\\infty}^4(V)$. One then takes the fourth root to find $n_{\\infty}(V)$. This is correct.\n\nAll parts of this protocol are scientifically sound and represent the canonical methods for characterizing Hodgkin-Huxley parameters.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B Evaluation**\n- **$g_{L}$ determination**: Measuring slope at depolarized potentials without blockers is incorrect. In this range, $g_K$ is large and time-variant, so the slope would primarily reflect potassium conductance, not leak.\n- **$E_{Na}$ determination**: The zero-crossing of the peak *total* current is not $E_{Na}$. At the voltage $V = E_{Na}$, the sodium current is zero, but the outward potassium and leak currents are not. Thus, the total current would be outward, not zero.\n- **$E_{K}$ determination**: This method is vaguely described and fundamentally incorrect. The peak current is dominated by the inward sodium current for most relevant voltages.\n- **Gating variables determination**: Normalizing mixed currents is invalid. The relationship $h_{\\infty}(V) = 1 - m_{\\infty}(V)$ is false; activation and inactivation are separate biophysical processes with different voltage dependencies.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C Evaluation**\n- **$g_{L}$ determination**: A $P/n$ procedure *subtracts* the leak current; it does not measure it. The procedure described is nonsensical.\n- **$E_{Na}$ determination**: This repeats the error from option B, equating the reversal of the total peak current with $E_{Na}$.\n- **$E_{K}$ determination**: Replacing external Na$^{+}$ removes $I_{Na}$, but the zero-crossing of the remaining steady-state current ($I_K + I_L$) occurs where $I_K = -I_L$, which is not $E_K$ unless $E_L = E_K$, an unlikely coincidence.\n- **Gating variables determination**: Fitting raw currents to sigmoids without converting to conductance is wrong, as the current is a product of conductance and driving force ($V - E_{ion}$). The suggested estimation for $h_{\\infty}(V)$ is also non-standard and inaccurate.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D Evaluation**\n- The entire protocol relies on **current-clamp** experiments. The problem explicitly states the experiment is to be performed in **voltage-clamp** and that parameters must be extracted from voltage steps. This option violates the fundamental constraints of the problem. Furthermore, the proposed methods (e.g., estimating $E_{Na}$ from spike peak) are approximations, not the precise measurements achievable with voltage clamp.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option E Evaluation**\n- **$E_{Na}$ determination**: This suggests measuring $E_{Na}$ after blocking the sodium current with TTX. This is illogical. If $I_{Na}$ is blocked, its reversal potential cannot be measured.\n- **$E_{K}$ determination**: Similarly, this suggests measuring $E_K$ after blocking the potassium current with TEA. This is also illogical.\n- **$m_{\\infty}(V)$ determination**: Using steady-state current to determine $m_{\\infty}(V)$ is incorrect because this current is contaminated by inactivation ($h_{\\infty}(V)$). One must use the peak current.\n- **$n_{\\infty}(V)$ determination**: \"Peak outward current\" is ambiguous and does not represent an isolated potassium conductance.\n- **$h_{\\infty}(V)$ determination**: The relation $h_{\\infty}(V) = 1 - m_{\\infty}(V)$ is fundamentally incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on this analysis, only Option A details a complete, scientifically valid, and internally consistent set of protocols that correctly adheres to the principles of voltage-clamp analysis within the Hodgkin-Huxley framework.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2570324"}, {"introduction": "Action potential propagation is remarkably reliable, yet this robustness has its limits.

The setup is self-consistent and realistic.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full derivation and analysis will now be performed.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe propagation of an action potential from one node of Ranvier to the next depends on the safety factor: the ratio of the charge delivered by the sodium current at the active node to the charge required to bring the subsequent node to its firing threshold. Conduction fails if this factor drops below $1$. We analyze the effect of cooling from $T_{1} = 37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to $T_{2} = 17\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ on the different components of this process. The temperature drop is $\\Delta T = T_{1} - T_{2} = 20\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\n1.  **Passive Properties:** The problem states that upon cooling, $R_{m}$ increases by a factor of $4$, $R_{i}$ increases by a factor of $1.5$, and $C_{m}$ is constant. Let variables at $17\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ be primed.\n    - $R'_{m} = 4R_{m}(37)$\n    - $R'_{i} = 1.5R_{i}(37)$\n    - $C'_{m} = C_{m}(37)$\n\n    The length constant $\\lambda = \\sqrt{R_{m}/R_{i}}$ (ignoring constant geometric factors) scales as:\n    $$ \\lambda' = \\sqrt{\\frac{R'_{m}}{R'_{i}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4 R_{m}(37)}{1.5 R_{i}(37)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{1.5}}\\,\\lambda(37) \\approx 1.63\\,\\lambda(37) $$\n    The length constant increases. This means passive voltage spread is more effective over distance, explaining the experimental observation that \"passive depolarization...increases in amplitude and spreads farther.\"\n\n    The membrane time constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{mem}} = R_{m}C_{m}$ scales as:\n    $$ \\tau'_{\\mathrm{mem}} = R'_{m}C'_{m} = (4R_{m}(37))C_{m}(37) = 4\\,\\tau_{\\mathrm{mem}}(37) $$\n    The time constant of the downstream nodal membrane increases by a factor of $4$. This means the subsequent node is \"slower\" to charge and requires a current to be applied for a longer duration to reach a given voltage.\n\n2.  **Active Properties (Channel Kinetics):** Gating time constants are inversely proportional to rates and scale with temperature according to the $Q_{10}$ formula. For a temperature drop $\\Delta T = 20\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, the time constants will increase by a factor of $Q_{10}^{(\\Delta T/10)} = Q_{10}^{(20/10)} = Q_{10}^2$.\n    - Sodium activation time constant: $\\tau'_{m} = \\tau_{m}(37) \\cdot (Q_{10,m})^2 = (0.20\\,\\mathrm{ms}) \\cdot (3.0)^2 = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. This is a $9$-fold increase.\n    - Sodium inactivation time constant: $\\tau'_{h} = \\tau_{h}(37) \\cdot (Q_{10,h})^2 = (1.0\\,\\mathrm{ms}) \\cdot (2.0)^2 = 4.0\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. This is a $4$-fold increase.\n    - Potassium activation time constant: $\\tau'_{n} = \\tau_{n}(37) \\cdot (Q_{10,n})^2 = (2.0\\,\\mathrm{ms}) \\cdot (3.0)^2 = 18.0\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. This is a $9$-fold increase.\n\n    The critical observation is the *differential slowing* of the sodium channel gates. The rate of activation ($k \\propto 1/\\tau_{m}$) slows by a factor of $9$, while the rate of inactivation ($k \\propto 1/\\tau_{h}$) slows by a factor of only $4$. At physiological temperature, fast activation ($\\tau_{m} \\ll \\tau_{h}$) allows the $m^3$ term to rise to its peak before the $h$ term can decrease significantly, producing a large, transient inward sodium current. Upon cooling, the activation process slows down more than the inactivation process. This allows inactivation to \"catch up\" with activation, meaning the $h(t)$ term begins to decrease substantially while the $m(t)$ term is still slowly rising. The consequence is that the product $m(t)^3 h(t)$ rises much more slowly and its peak amplitude is significantly reduced.\n\n3.  **Driving Force ($E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$):** The Nernst potential is directly proportional to absolute temperature, $T$.\n    - $T_1 = 37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} = 310.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n    - $T_2 = 17\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} = 290.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n    $$ E'_{\\mathrm{Na}} = E_{\\mathrm{Na}}(37) \\cdot \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = (+60\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\cdot \\frac{290.15}{310.15} \\approx +56.1\\,\\mathrm{mV} $$\n    The sodium reversal potential *decreases*, which reduces the electrochemical driving force, $(V-E_{\\mathrm{Na}})$, for sodium influx at any given depolarized potential $V$. This further reduces the peak sodium current.\n\n**Synthesis and Conclusion:**\nConduction failure occurs because the source of current (the active node) becomes insufficient to charge the target (the next node) to its threshold potential in time.\n- The sodium current $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}(t)$ is weakened and slowed for two reasons: (1) The peak value of the gating term $m(t)^3h(t)$ is reduced due to the disproportionate slowing of activation relative to inactivation. (2) The driving force $(V-E_{\\mathrm{Na}})$ is slightly reduced. The overall rate of rise and the peak of the sodium current are thus substantially diminished.\n- The target node becomes \"harder\" to excite because its membrane time constant $\\tau'_{\\mathrm{mem}}$ has increased fourfold. It requires more charge (current integrated over time) to reach threshold, and crucially, threshold must be reached before repolarizing currents dominate. A slower-rising, smaller-amplitude source current struggles to charge this \"slower\" membrane.\nThe increased passive spread ($\\lambda' > \\lambda$) is a red herring in explaining failure; while it delivers a larger fraction of the potential to the next node, this is irrelevant if the active current generation process at the source node is critically impaired. The rate of depolarization is the key factor, and this rate is a product of the source current's strength and the target membrane's properties. The kinetics of the sodium current are overwhelmingly the limiting factor, leading to a drop in the safety factor below unity.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. **At $17\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, sodium activation slows disproportionately more than inactivation and potassium activation, so the product $m(t)^{3}h(t)$ rises too slowly and peaks too low to produce sufficient fast inward current.

Sodium activation time constant $\\tau_m$ increases $9$-fold while inactivation time constant $\\tau_h$ increases $4$-fold, so activation slows disproportionately. This reduces the peak of $m^3h$. The downstream node's $\\tau_{\\mathrm{mem}}$ increases $4$-fold.

According to the Nernst equation, $E_{\\mathrm{ion}} \\propto T$ (absolute temperature). Cooling from $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to $17\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ *decreases* the absolute temperature, so the magnitude of $E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ *decreases*, reducing the driving force. The entire premise of this option is factually wrong.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. **At $17\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, the increased membrane resistance $R_{m}$ and larger length constant $\\lambda$ cause the action potential to spread too far passively and “dissipate,” preventing the next node from reaching threshold.**\nThis demonstrates a misunderstanding of cable properties. A larger length constant $\\lambda$ means the potential decays *less* with distance, improving passive propagation. The observation of \"increased passive depolarization\" at the downstream node contradicts the notion of dissipation. Enhanced passive spread, by itself, would aid propagation, not hinder it.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. **At $17\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, the sole cause is increased axial resistance $R_{i}$, which blocks axial current to downstream nodes; channel kinetics are irrelevant provided electrotonic depolarization is larger.**\nThis is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, it dismisses channel kinetics, which are central to active potential generation and enormously sensitive to temperature. Second, while increased $R_{i}$ does hinder current flow, its effect on passive spread is overcome by the even larger increase in $R_m$, resulting in a *net increase* in the length constant $\\lambda$ and a larger passive depolarization, as stated in the problem. The cause cannot be solely increased $R_i$, and kinetics are not irrelevant.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nE. **At $17\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, sodium activation and inactivation slow equally, increasing the overlap (“window current”) and thereby increasing the safety factor for propagation, so conduction failure is unexpected and must arise from measurement artifact rather than channel kinetics.**\nThis is factually incorrect based on the provided parameters. With $Q_{10,m}=3.0$ and $Q_{10,h}=2.0$, the rates slow unequally. Activation slows by a factor of $9$, while inactivation slows by a factor of $4$. The premise is false. Consequently, the conclusion that the safety factor would increase is also baseless. The failure is a direct and expected result of the channel kinetics, not an artifact.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2570355"}]}
