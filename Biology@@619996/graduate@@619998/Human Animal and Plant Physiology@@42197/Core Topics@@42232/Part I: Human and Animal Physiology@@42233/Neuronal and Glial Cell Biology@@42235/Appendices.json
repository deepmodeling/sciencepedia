We will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part solution: first, the derivation of the steady-state activation function $m_{\\infty}(V)$; second, the calculation of the half-activation voltage $V_{1/2}$ and the slope factor $k$; and third, the determination of the effective gating charge $z$.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Activation Function\n\nWe begin with the premise of a two-state equilibrium between a closed ($C$) and an open ($O$) conformation of the channel's voltage sensor:\n$$ C \\rightleftharpoons O $$\nThe equilibrium constant for this transition, $K_{eq}$, is the ratio of the concentration of open states to closed states:\n$$ K_{eq} = \\frac{[O]}{[C]} $$\nFrom statistical mechanics, the equilibrium constant is related to the change in Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta G$, by the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$ K_{eq} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G}{RT}\\right) $$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The problem states that the free energy difference is voltage-dependent:\n$$ \\Delta G(V) = \\Delta G_{0} - z F V $$\nHere, $\\Delta G_{0}$ is the intrinsic free energy difference at zero membrane potential ($V=0$), $z$ is the effective gating charge, and $F$ is the Faraday constant.\n\nThe steady-state activation fraction, $m_{\\infty}(V)$, is equivalent to the probability of finding the channel in the open state, $P_{\\mathrm{O}}(V)$. This probability is the fraction of channels in the open state relative to the total number of channels:\n$$ m_{\\infty}(V) = P_{\\mathrm{O}}(V) = \\frac{[O]}{[C] + [O]} $$\nTo express this in terms of $K_{eq}$, we divide the numerator and denominator by $[C]$:\n$$ m_{\\infty}(V) = \\frac{[O]/[C]}{[C]/[C] + [O]/[C]} = \\frac{K_{eq}}{1 + K_{eq}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $K_{eq}$:\n$$ m_{\\infty}(V) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\Delta G(V) / (RT))}{1 + \\exp(-\\Delta G(V) / (RT))} $$\nThis can be rearranged by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\exp(+\\Delta G(V) / (RT))$:\n$$ m_{\\infty}(V) = \\frac{1}{\\exp(+\\Delta G(V) / (RT)) + 1} $$\nNow, we substitute the given expression for $\\Delta G(V)$:\n$$ m_{\\infty}(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_{0} - zFV}{RT}\\right)} $$\nTo match this to the canonical logistic (Boltzmann) form $m_{\\infty}(V) = \\dfrac{1}{1 + \\exp((V_{1/2} - V)/k)}$, we equate the exponents:\n$$ \\frac{V_{1/2} - V}{k} = \\frac{\\Delta G_{0} - zFV}{RT} = \\frac{\\Delta G_{0}}{RT} - \\frac{zF}{RT}V $$\nBy comparing the coefficients of $V$ and the constant terms, we can identify $V_{1/2}$ and $k$.\nComparing the terms dependent on $V$:\n$$ -\\frac{V}{k} = -\\frac{zF}{RT}V \\implies k = \\frac{RT}{zF} $$\nComparing the constant terms:\n$$ \\frac{V_{1/2}}{k} = \\frac{\\Delta G_{0}}{RT} \\implies V_{1/2} = k \\frac{\\Delta G_{0}}{RT} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $k$ into the expression for $V_{1/2}$:\n$$ V_{1/2} = \\left(\\frac{RT}{zF}\\right) \\frac{\\Delta G_{0}}{RT} = \\frac{\\Delta G_{0}}{zF} $$\nThe half-activation voltage, $V_{1/2}$, is the voltage at which $m_{\\infty}(V_{1/2}) = 0.5$. At this voltage, the exponent in the Boltzmann function must be zero, which means $\\Delta G(V_{1/2}) = 0$. Thus, $\\Delta G_0 - zFV_{1/2} = 0$, which confirms that $V_{1/2} = \\Delta G_0 / (zF)$.

Derivation of the Reversal Potential ($E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$)**\nThe reversal potential for a channel permeable to multiple ion species is described by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) voltage equation:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{rev}} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{\\sum_{i}^{\\text{cations}} P_i [C_i]_o + \\sum_{j}^{\\text{anions}} P_j [A_j]_i}{\\sum_{i}^{\\text{cations}} P_i [C_i]_i + \\sum_{j}^{\\text{anions}} P_j [A_j]_o} \\right) $$\nwhere $P_i$ is the permeability of ion $i$, and $[...]_o$ and $[...]_i$ are the extracellular and intracellular concentrations, respectively. The problem states that the channel is permeable only to $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ and impermeable to $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ and other ions.

The expression is:\n$$ g = N \\gamma p_{\\mathrm{open}} $$\n\n**3.

Therefore, the functional dependence is:\n$$\nP(C) = P_{\\max} \\frac{C^{n}}{K_{d}^{n} + C^{n}}\n$$\n\nPart 2: Fold-change in the $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration for half-maximal release.\nHalf-maximal release occurs at a concentration $C_{1/2}$ such that $P(C_{1/2}) = P_{\\max}/2$. Using the derived expression:\n$$\n\\frac{P_{\\max}}{2} = P_{\\max} \\frac{C_{1/2}^{n}}{K_{d}^{n} + C_{1/2}^{n}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{C_{1/2}^{n}}{K_{d}^{n} + C_{1/2}^{n}} \\implies K_{d}^{n} + C_{1/2}^{n} = 2 C_{1/2}^{n} \\implies K_{d}^{n} = C_{1/2}^{n}\n$$\nThis shows that $C_{1/2} = K_{d}$. The half-maximal concentration is equal to the effective dissociation constant.\nFor the wild-type (WT) and mutant (Mut) sensors, the half-maximal concentrations are:\n$C_{1/2, \\mathrm{WT}} = K_{d,\\mathrm{WT}} = 15~\\mu \\mathrm{M}$.\n$C_{1/2, \\mathrm{Mut}} = K_{d,\\mathrm{Mut}} = 30~\\mu \\mathrm{M}$.\nThe fold-change caused by the mutation is the ratio:\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{C_{1/2, \\mathrm{Mut}}}{C_{1/2, \\mathrm{WT}}} = \\frac{30~\\mu \\mathrm{M}}{15~\\mu \\mathrm{M}} = 2\n$$\n\nPart 3: Paired-pulse ratio (PPR) for the mutant.\nThe PPR is defined as $\\mathrm{PPR} = \\frac{P_{2}(1 - P_{1})}{P_{1}}$. We must compute the release probabilities $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ for the mutant under the specified two-pulse protocol.\nThe parameters for the mutant are $n=4$, $P_{\\max}=0.8$, and $K_{d,\\mathrm{Mut}} = 30~\\mu \\mathrm{M}$.\nThe relevant calcium concentrations are determined by $[\\mathrm{Ca}]_{0} = 0.05~\\mu \\mathrm{M}$, $\\Delta C = 30~\\mu \\mathrm{M}$, $r=0.05$, $\\tau=50~\\mathrm{ms}$, and $\\Delta t=20~\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the peak calcium concentration for the first pulse at $t=0$:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Ca}]_{1} = [\\mathrm{Ca}]_{0} + \\Delta C = 0.05~\\mu \\mathrm{M} + 30~\\mu \\mathrm{M} = 30.05~\\mu \\mathrm{M}\n$$\nThe release probability for the first pulse, $P_{1}$, is:\n$$\nP_{1} = P([\\mathrm{Ca}]_{1}) = P_{\\max} \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}]_{1}^{n}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{Mut}}^{n} + [\\mathrm{Ca}]_{1}^{n}} = 0.8 \\times \\frac{(30.05)^{4}}{(30)^{4} + (30.05)^{4}} \\approx 0.40133\n$$\n\nNext, calculate the calcium concentration just before the second pulse at $t=\\Delta t$. This includes the residual calcium from the first pulse:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Ca}]_{\\mathrm{res}}(\\Delta t) = r\\,\\Delta C\\,\\exp(-\\Delta t/\\tau) = 0.05 \\times 30~\\mu \\mathrm{M} \\times \\exp\\left(-\\frac{20}{50}\\right) = 1.5 \\exp(-0.4)~\\mu \\mathrm{M} \\approx 1.00548~\\mu \\mathrm{M}\n$$\nThe peak calcium concentration for the second pulse is:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Ca}]_{2} = [\\mathrm{Ca}]_{0} + [\\mathrm{Ca}]_{\\mathrm{res}}(\\Delta t) + \\Delta C \\approx 0.05~\\mu \\mathrm{M} + 1.00548~\\mu \\mathrm{M} + 30~\\mu \\mathrm{M} = 31.05548~\\mu \\mathrm{M}\n$$\nThe release probability for the second pulse, $P_{2}$, is:\n$$\nP_{2} = P([\\mathrm{Ca}]_{2}) = P_{\\max} \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}]_{2}^{n}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{Mut}}^{n} + [\\mathrm{Ca}]_{2}^{n}} = 0.8 \\times \\frac{(31.05548)^{4}}{(30)^{4} + (31.05548)^{4}} \\approx 0.42876\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the PPR using the given formula, accounting for vesicle depletion:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PPR} = \\frac{P_{2}(1 - P_{1})}{P_{1}} \\approx \\frac{0.42876 \\times (1 - 0.40133)}{0.40133} \\approx \\frac{0.42876 \\times 0.59867}{0.40133} \\approx 0.63952\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the value $S$:\n$$\nS = (\\text{fold-change}) \\times (\\mathrm{PPR}) = 2 \\times 0.63952 \\approx 1.27904\n$$\nRounding this result to three significant figures gives $1.28$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.28}\n$$", "id": "2587314"}]}
