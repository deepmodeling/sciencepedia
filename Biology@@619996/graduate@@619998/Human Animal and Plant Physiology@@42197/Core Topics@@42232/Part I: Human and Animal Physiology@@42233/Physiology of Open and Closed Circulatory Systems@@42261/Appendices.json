This exercise explores the profound impact of vessel radius on hydraulic resistance and volumetric flow, a relationship quantitatively described by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. By modeling a pathological arterial narrowing (stenosis), you will derive from first principles how even a small change in radius can dramatically alter blood supply, providing a critical insight into the system's efficiency and its vulnerability to disease [@problem_id:2596459].", "problem": "A single, straight arterial segment of length $L$ and initial inner radius $r_0$ carries an incompressible, Newtonian fluid of dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ under steady, fully developed laminar flow at low Reynolds number (Reynolds number (Re) $\\ll 1$). The mean pressure drop across the segment, $\\Delta P$, is maintained approximately constant by the cardiac pump, as is characteristic of a closed circulatory system. Let the baseline volumetric flow be $Q_0$ in this state. Now suppose a focal stenosis develops that narrows a contiguous fraction $s$ of the segment’s length to a reduced radius $\\gamma r_0$ with $0<\\gamma<1$, while the remaining fraction $(1-s)$ of the segment retains radius $r_0$.

Do not include units with your final answer.", "solution": "The problem statement is scrutinized and found to be valid. It is a well-posed problem grounded in the fundamental principles of fluid dynamics, specifically the Hagen-Poiseuille law for laminar flow, and poses a standard, solvable question in biofluid mechanics. The assumptions, such as Newtonian fluid and rigid walls, are acceptable idealizations for constructing a first-order model. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe foundational relationship between the mean pressure drop $\\Delta P$ across a vessel segment, the volumetric flow rate $Q$, and the hydraulic resistance $R$ is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta P = Q \\times R\n$$\nThis is analogous to Ohm's law in electrical circuits. For steady, fully developed laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid with dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ in a straight cylindrical tube of length $l$ and inner radius $r$, the hydraulic resistance $R$ is described by the Poiseuille-Hagen equation as:\n$$\nR = \\frac{8 \\mu l}{\\pi r^{4}}\n$$\nFirst, we analyze the baseline state of the artery before the stenosis develops. The segment has a uniform length $L$ and radius $r_0$. The baseline hydraulic resistance, $R_0$, is therefore:\n$$\nR_0 = \\frac{8 \\mu L}{\\pi r_0^{4}}\n$$\nThe baseline volumetric flow, $Q_0$, under the constant pressure drop $\\Delta P$ is:\n$$\nQ_0 = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R_0} = \\frac{\\Delta P \\pi r_0^{4}}{8 \\mu L}\n$$\nNext, we consider the artery after the development of a focal stenosis. The problem states that a fraction $s$ of the segment's length is narrowed, while the remaining fraction $(1-s)$ is not. This configuration can be modeled as two hydraulic resistors connected in series. The total resistance of resistors in series is the sum of their individual resistances.\n\nThe first resistor corresponds to the stenosed (narrowed) portion of the artery. Its length is $l_1 = sL$, and its radius is $r_1 = \\gamma r_0$. The resistance of this portion, $R_1$, is:\n$$\nR_1 = \\frac{8 \\mu l_1}{\\pi r_1^{4}} = \\frac{8 \\mu (sL)}{\\pi (\\gamma r_0)^{4}} = \\frac{8 \\mu s L}{\\pi \\gamma^{4} r_0^{4}}\n$$\nThe second resistor corresponds to the remaining, unstenosed portion. Its length is $l_2 = (1-s)L$, and its radius is $r_2 = r_0$. The resistance of this portion, $R_2$, is:\n$$\nR_2 = \\frac{8 \\mu l_2}{\\pi r_2^{4}} = \\frac{8 \\mu (1-s)L}{\\pi r_0^{4}}\n$$\nThe total new resistance of the stenosed artery, $R_{\\text{new}}$, is the sum of $R_1$ and $R_2$:\n$$\nR_{\\text{new}} = R_1 + R_2 = \\frac{8 \\mu s L}{\\pi \\gamma^{4} r_0^{4}} + \\frac{8 \\mu (1-s)L}{\\pi r_0^{4}}\n$$\nWe can factor out the common term $\\frac{8 \\mu L}{\\pi r_0^{4}}$, which is exactly the baseline resistance $R_0$:\n$$\nR_{\\text{new}} = \\left( \\frac{s}{\\gamma^{4}} + (1-s) \\right) \\frac{8 \\mu L}{\\pi r_0^{4}} = R_0 \\left( 1 - s + \\frac{s}{\\gamma^{4}} \\right)\n$$\nThe new volumetric flow, $Q_{\\text{new}}$, occurs under the same constant pressure drop $\\Delta P$ but against the new resistance $R_{\\text{new}}$:\n$$\nQ_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R_{\\text{new}}} = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R_0 \\left( 1 - s + \\frac{s}{\\gamma^{4}} \\right)}\n$$\nWe are asked to find the ratio $\\frac{Q_{\\text{new}}}{Q_0}$. Using the expressions for $Q_0$ and $Q_{\\text{new}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{Q_{\\text{new}}}{Q_0} = \\frac{\\frac{\\Delta P}{R_0 \\left( 1 - s + \\frac{s}{\\gamma^{4}} \\right)}}{\\frac{\\Delta P}{R_0}}\n$$\nCanceling the term $\\frac{\\Delta P}{R_0}$ from the numerator and denominator yields the final expression:\n$$\n\\frac{Q_{\\text{new}}}{Q_0} = \\frac{1}{1 - s + \\frac{s}{\\gamma^{4}}}\n$$\nThis closed-form expression gives the reduction in flow as a function of only the fractional length of the stenosis, $s$, and the fractional reduction in radius, $\\gamma$.\n\nPhysiologically, this result has profound implications for closed circulatory systems like that in humans. The term $\\gamma^{4}$ in the denominator demonstrates an extremely high sensitivity of flow to changes in vessel radius. Since $\\gamma < 1$, the term $1/\\gamma^{4}$ is significantly greater than $1$. For example, a halving of the radius ($\\gamma = 0.5$) increases the resistance of the affected segment by a factor of $(0.5)^{-4} = 16$. This means even a short stenosis (small $s$) can cause a catastrophic drop in blood flow. This mathematical relationship explains why atherosclerotic plaques, which cause focal narrowing of arteries, are so dangerous and can lead to ischemia (inadequate blood supply) in downstream tissues, potentially causing heart attacks or strokes. The high-pressure, high-efficiency design of a closed circulatory system is thus vulnerable to such localized failures.\n\nThis quantitative law does not extend to open circulatory systems, such as those found in arthropods. In these systems, the circulatory fluid (hemolymph) is not always confined to vessels but flows at low pressure through open sinuses and cavities (the hemocoel) that directly bathe the tissues. The geometry is complex and cannot be modeled as a network of simple cylindrical tubes. The Hagen-Poiseuille law, which is derived for flow in long, rigid cylinders, is fundamentally inapplicable. Flow dynamics in such systems are governed by more complex principles related to flow through porous media and ill-defined channels, and the concept of a discrete, additive hydraulic resistance for a \"stenosis\" is not meaningful in the same way.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{1 - s + \\frac{s}{\\gamma^{4}}}}\n$$", "id": "2596459"}, {"introduction": "Efficient gas transport is the ultimate purpose of circulation, and closed systems excel at this by employing specialized respiratory pigments within the blood.

Therefore, we equate Equation ($1$) and Equation ($2$):\n$$E_{\\mathrm{es}} (V_{\\mathrm{es}} - V_{0}) = E_{\\mathrm{a}} (V_{\\mathrm{ed}} - V_{\\mathrm{es}})$$\nThis equation must be solved for the end-systolic volume, $V_{\\mathrm{es}}$, as it is the primary determinant of ventricular performance under these constraints.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{es}}V_{\\mathrm{es}} - E_{\\mathrm{es}}V_{0} = E_{\\mathrm{a}}V_{\\mathrm{ed}} - E_{\\mathrm{a}}V_{\\mathrm{es}}$$\n$$V_{\\mathrm{es}}(E_{\\mathrm{es}} + E_{\\mathrm{a}}) = E_{\\mathrm{a}}V_{\\mathrm{ed}} + E_{\\mathrm{es}}V_{0}$$\n$$V_{\\mathrm{es}} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}}V_{\\mathrm{ed}} + E_{\\mathrm{es}}V_{0}}{E_{\\mathrm{es}} + E_{\\mathrm{a}}}$$\nThis is the general expression for end-systolic volume.\n\nFrom this, we derive the expressions for stroke volume ($SV$) and end-systolic pressure ($P_{\\mathrm{es}}$).\n$$SV = V_{\\mathrm{ed}} - V_{\\mathrm{es}} = V_{\\mathrm{ed}} - \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}}V_{\\mathrm{ed}} + E_{\\mathrm{es}}V_{0}}{E_{\\mathrm{es}} + E_{\\mathrm{a}}}$$\n$$SV = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{ed}}(E_{\\mathrm{es}} + E_{\\mathrm{a}}) - (E_{\\mathrm{a}}V_{\\mathrm{ed}} + E_{\\mathrm{es}}V_{0})}{E_{\\mathrm{es}} + E_{\\mathrm{a}}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{ed}}E_{\\mathrm{es}} + V_{\\mathrm{ed}}E_{\\mathrm{a}} - E_{\\mathrm{a}}V_{\\mathrm{ed}} - E_{\\mathrm{es}}V_{0}}{E_{\\mathrm{es}} + E_{\\mathrm{a}}}$$\n$$SV = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{es}}(V_{\\mathrm{ed}} - V_{0})}{E_{\\mathrm{es}} + E_{\\mathrm{a}}}$$\nAnd for end-systolic pressure, using $P_{\\mathrm{es}} = E_{\\mathrm{a}} \\cdot SV$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{es}} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}} E_{\\mathrm{es}} (V_{\\mathrm{ed}} - V_{0})}{E_{\\mathrm{es}} + E_{\\mathrm{a}}}$$\n\n**Quantitative Calculation**\n\nThe given parameters are:\n$E_{\\mathrm{es}} = 2.0~\\mathrm{mmHg\\,mL^{-1}}$\n$V_{0} = 10~\\mathrm{mL}$\n$V_{\\mathrm{ed}} = 140~\\mathrm{mL}$\nThe quantity $(V_{\\mathrm{ed}} - V_{0}) = (140 - 10)~\\mathrm{mL} = 130~\\mathrm{mL}$.\n\n**Case 0: Baseline Condition**\nHere, $E_{\\mathrm{a,0}} = 1.0~\\mathrm{mmHg\\,mL^{-1}}$.\n$$SV_{0} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{es}}(V_{\\mathrm{ed}} - V_{0})}{E_{\\mathrm{es}} + E_{\\mathrm{a,0}}} = \\frac{2.0 \\cdot 130}{2.0 + 1.0} = \\frac{260}{3}~\\mathrm{mL}$$\n$$EF_{0} = \\frac{SV_{0}}{V_{\\mathrm{ed}}} = \\frac{260/3}{140} = \\frac{260}{420} = \\frac{26}{42} = \\frac{13}{21}$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{es,0}} = E_{\\mathrm{a,0}} \\cdot SV_{0} = 1.0 \\cdot \\frac{260}{3} = \\frac{260}{3}~\\mathrm{mmHg}$$\n\n**Case 1: Afterload Intervention**\nHere, $E_{\\mathrm{a,1}} = 2.0~\\mathrm{mmHg\\,mL^{-1}}$.\n$$SV_{1} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{es}}(V_{\\mathrm{ed}} - V_{0})}{E_{\\mathrm{es}} + E_{\\mathrm{a,1}}} = \\frac{2.0 \\cdot 130}{2.0 + 2.0} = \\frac{260}{4} = 65~\\mathrm{mL}$$\n$$EF_{1} = \\frac{SV_{1}}{V_{\\mathrm{ed}}} = \\frac{65}{140} = \\frac{13}{28}$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{es,1}} = E_{\\mathrm{a,1}} \\cdot SV_{1} = 2.0 \\cdot 65 = 130~\\mathrm{mmHg}$$\n\n**Calculation of Changes**\n\nWe now compute the required differences.
