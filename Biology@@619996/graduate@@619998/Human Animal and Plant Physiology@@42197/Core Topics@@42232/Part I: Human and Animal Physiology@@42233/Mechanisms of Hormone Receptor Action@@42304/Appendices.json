It is based on the established operational model of agonism introduced by Black and Leff, a fundamental concept in quantitative pharmacology.

Potency is inversely related to $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ (a smaller $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ indicates higher potency), while affinity is inversely related to $K_A$ (a smaller $K_A$ indicates higher affinity). The transducer parameter $\\tau$ is a measure of receptor reserve and signaling efficiency; by definition, $\\tau \\ge 0$.\nThe derived expression $\\mathrm{EC}_{50} = K_A / (1+\\tau)$ shows that for any system with a non-zero receptor reserve ($\\tau > 0$), we have $1+\\tau > 1$, which implies that $\\mathrm{EC}_{50} < K_A$. This means the concentration required to elicit a half-maximal *response* is lower than the concentration required to achieve half-maximal receptor *occupancy*. The receptor reserve, embodied by $\\tau$, effectively amplifies the signal generated by receptor binding. A highly efficient system (large $\\tau$) requires only a small fraction of receptors to be occupied to produce a substantial response, thus shifting the dose-response curve to the left of the binding curve and increasing the apparent potency of the agonist. The phrase \"compresses potency relative to affinity\" refers to this phenomenon where the numerical value of $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ is \"compressed\" to be smaller than $K_A$. The magnitude of this effect is dictated by the factor $(1+\\tau)$.\n\nLastly, we address the conditions under which potency does not track affinity. The derived formula shows that $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ is a function of two parameters: $K_A$, which is a property of the drug-receptor interaction, and $\\tau$, which is a property of the biological system (e.g., cell, tissue). The problem gives an example of two preparations sharing the same $K_A$ but differing in $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$. This situation arises when a single agonist (constant $K_A$) is tested in two different systems, say System $1$ and System $2$, with different transducer parameters $\\tau_1$ and $\\tau_2$. The potencies will be:\n$$\\mathrm{EC}_{50,1} = \\frac{K_A}{1+\\tau_1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathrm{EC}_{50,2} = \\frac{K_A}{1+\\tau_2}$$\nIf $\\tau_1 \\neq \\tau_2$, then it is necessary that $\\mathrm{EC}_{50,1} \\neq \\mathrm{EC}_{50,2}$, even though the agonist's affinity for the receptor, $K_A$, is identical in both systems.\nMechanistically, $\\tau$ reflects factors such as receptor density and the efficiency of the downstream signal transduction cascade. These properties are highly variable across different biological contexts. Therefore, potency ($\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$) will fail to track affinity ($K_A$) when comparing:\n1.  Different tissues or cell types, which naturally express different levels of receptors and signaling components.\n2.  The same tissue in different physiological or pathological states (e.g., disease-induced changes in receptor expression).\n3.  Experimental preparations where the receptor population has been artificially altered, for example by partial irreversible antagonism, which reduces the effective value of $\\tau$.\nIn conclusion, affinity is a characteristic of the molecular interaction between a drug and its target receptor, whereas potency is an emergent, system-dependent property that reflects both this affinity and the downstream signal amplification capacity of the cellular environment.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{K_A}{1+\\tau}}$$", "id": "2580019"}, {"introduction": "This final practice integrates the preceding concepts into a comprehensive, multi-state computational model that mirrors modern quantitative systems pharmacology research.

The objective function is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SSR}(k_{\\mathrm{on}}) = \\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}} \\left(c_{\\mathrm{sim}}(t; k_{\\mathrm{on}}, [A]_b) - c_{\\mathrm{obs}}(t; k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{\\star}, [A]_b)\\right)^2 + \\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}} \\left(c_{\\mathrm{sim}}(t; k_{\\mathrm{on}}, [A]_o) - c_{\\mathrm{obs}}(t; k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{\\star}, [A]_o)\\right)^2\n$$\nHere, $c_{\\mathrm{sim}}$ denotes the cAMP concentration produced by the model for a candidate $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$, and $c_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ is the synthetic data. The minimization is performed over both the baseline and overexpression datasets simultaneously to robustly constrain the parameter. We use the `minimize` function from `scipy.optimize`, with the L-BFGS-B algorithm, which accommodates the physical constraint that the rate constant must be non-negative, i.e., $k_{\\mathrm{on}} \\ge 0$. As the data are generated from the same model structure being fitted, we expect the estimated $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ to be nearly identical to the ground-truth $k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{\\star}$.\n\n**3. Prediction of Endosomal Signaling Fraction**\nWith the estimated value of $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ (henceforth denoted $k_{\\mathrm{on,est}}$), we compute the fraction of total signaling that originates from the endosomal compartment, $\\Phi(T)$. This metric is defined as:\n$$\n\\Phi(T) = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{T} v_e(t)\\,dt}{\\int_{0}^{T} \\left(v_p(t)+v_e(t)\\right)\\,dt} = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{T} \\beta_e R_e(t)\\,dt}{\\int_{0}^{T} \\left(\\beta_p R_p(t) + \\beta_e R_e(t)\\right)\\,dt}\n$$\nTo compute these integrals accurately, we augment the original ODE system with two additional states: $s_e(t) = \\int_0^t v_e(\\tau) d\\tau$ and $s_{\\mathrm{tot}}(t) = \\int_0^t (v_p(\\tau)+v_e(\\tau)) d\\tau$. Their dynamics are given by:\n$$\n\\frac{ds_e}{dt} = v_e(t) = \\beta_e R_e(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{ds_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{dt} = v_p(t)+v_e(t) = \\beta_p R_p(t) + \\beta_e R_e(t)\n$$\nwith initial conditions $s_e(0)=0$ and $s_{\\mathrm{tot}}(0)=0$. We integrate this augmented $6$-state system from $t=0$ to the specified time $T_i$ for each case, using the estimated parameter $k_{\\mathrm{on,est}}$ and the overexpression condition $[A]_o = \\alpha$. The desired fraction is then simply the ratio of the final values of the integral states: $\\Phi(T_i) = s_e(T_i) / s_{\\mathrm{tot}}(T_i)$. The denominator $s_{\\mathrm{tot}}(T_i)$ is guaranteed to be non-zero for $T_i > 0$ because signaling from the plasma membrane begins immediately at $t=0$.\n\nThis entire computational workflow is implemented for each of the three test cases, and the final results are formatted as requested.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the GPCR signaling model problem by generating synthetic data,\n    fitting the arrestin association rate k_on, and predicting the endosomal\n    signaling fraction for three test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Known constants, as specified in the problem\n    params_const = {\n        'R0': 1.0,          # Initial active receptor concentration\n        'beta_p': 5.0,      # Plasma membrane cAMP production rate coeff\n        'beta_e': 3.0,      # Endosomal cAMP production rate coeff\n        'k_off': 0.02,      # Receptor deactivation rate\n        'k_int': 0.05,      # Internalization rate\n        'k_off_e': 0.01,    # Endosomal receptor deactivation rate\n        'k_deg': 0.3,       # cAMP degradation rate\n    }\n\n    # Time points for data sampling\n    T_grid = np.array([0., 10., 20., 40., 60., 90., 120., 180.])\n    \n    # Baseline arrestin concentration\n    A_b = 1.0\n\n    # Test cases\n    test_cases = [\n        {'alpha': 5.0, 'k_on_star': 0.08, 'T': 180.0, 'case_id': 1},\n        {'alpha': 2.0, 'k_on_star': 0.05, 'T': 120.0, 'case_id': 2},\n        {'alpha': 8.0, 'k_on_star': 0.12, 'T': 60.0, 'case_id': 3},\n    ]\n\n    final_results = []\n\n    # ODE system function for the 4-state model (fitting)\n    def ode_system_4_states(t, y, k_on, A_val, p):\n        Rp, RpA, Re, c = y\n        dRp_dt = -(k_on * A_val + p['k_off']) * Rp\n        dRpA_dt = k_on * A_val * Rp - p['k_int'] * RpA\n        dRe_dt = p['k_int'] * RpA - p['k_off_e'] * Re\n        dc_dt = p['beta_p'] * Rp + p['beta_e'] * Re - p['k_deg'] * c\n        return [dRp_dt, dRpA_dt, dRe_dt, dc_dt]\n\n    # ODE system function for the 6-state model (prediction)\n    def ode_system_6_states(t, y, k_on, A_val, p):\n        Rp, RpA, Re, c, se, stot = y\n        dRp_dt = -(k_on * A_val + p['k_off']) * Rp\n        dRpA_dt = k_on * A_val * Rp - p['k_int'] * RpA\n        dRe_dt = p['k_int'] * RpA - p['k_off_e'] * Re\n        dc_dt = p['beta_p'] * Rp + p['beta_e'] * Re - p['k_deg'] * c\n        dse_dt = p['beta_e'] * Re\n        dstot_dt = p['beta_p'] * Rp + p['beta_e'] * Re\n        return [dRp_dt, dRpA_dt, dRe_dt, dc_dt, dse_dt, dstot_dt]\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        alpha = case['alpha']\n        k_on_star = case['k_on_star']\n        T_final = case['T']\n        A_o = alpha\n\n        # 1.
