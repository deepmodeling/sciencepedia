The concepts of TEER, $P_{\\text{app}}$, solvent drag, tight junctions, and claudins are central to this field. The experimental setup described is a standard *in vitro* model (e.g., Caco-2 cells on Transwell inserts). The assumed physical laws (Ohm's, Fick's) are appropriate for modeling the described phenomena at this scale. The problem is scientifically valid.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly stated.

It provides the necessary physical principles to reason from and a specific biological context. There are no internal contradictions.\n5.  **Realism**: The experimental scenario is realistic and mirrors common laboratory practice in cell biology and drug delivery research.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a sound, well-posed problem in biophysics and cell physiology. I will proceed with a full derivation and analysis.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nFirst, let us define the measured quantities from the given first principles.\n\n**Transepithelial Electrical Resistance (TEER)**\nAccording to Ohm's law, resistance $R$ is given by $R = V/I$, where $V$ is the voltage difference and $I$ is the current. For an epithelial monolayer of area $A$, the total resistance $R_T$ is composed of parallel resistances from the transcellular pathway ($R_{trans}$) and the paracellular pathway ($R_{para}$). The total conductance $G_T$ is the sum of the individual conductances: $G_T = G_{trans} + G_{para}$, where $G = 1/R$. Thus, $1/R_T = 1/R_{trans} + 1/R_{para}$.\nTEER is the area-normalized resistance, defined as $TEER = R_T \\times A$. Its units are typically $\\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2$. TEER is a measure of the barrier's resistance to ion flow. The paracellular pathway, through the tight junctions, is often the primary route for ion conductance in \"leaky\" epithelia like the intestine.\nThe perturbation is an increase in a *cation-selective pore-forming tight junction protein*. This increases the number of pathways for cations to flow down an electrochemical gradient. This directly increases the paracellular conductance, $G_{para}$, and therefore the total conductance $G_T$. Since resistance is the inverse of conductance, the total resistance $R_T$ must decrease. Consequently, **TEER decreases**.\n\n**Apparent Permeability Coefficient ($P_{\\text{app}}$)**\nAccording to Fick's first law, the diffusive flux $J$ (amount per unit area per unit time) of a solute is proportional to the concentration gradient: $J = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}$. Across a membrane barrier, this is simplified under steady-state conditions to $J = P \\cdot \\Delta C$, where $P$ is the permeability coefficient and $\\Delta C$ is the concentration difference.\nExperimentally, $P_{\\text{app}}$ is calculated from the rate of appearance of a solute in the receiver compartment, $\\frac{dQ}{dt}$, under sink conditions ($C_{receiver} \\approx 0$). The formula is $P_{\\text{app}} = \\frac{dQ/dt}{A \\cdot C_{donor}}$, where $A$ is the area and $C_{donor}$ is the concentration in the donor compartment. The units of $P_{\\text{app}}$ are length per time, e.g., $\\mathrm{cm} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nFor hydrophilic probes, transport is primarily paracellular and is governed by the size and charge selectivity of the tight junction pores.\n- **Probe 1: Fluorescein ($332\\,\\mathrm{Da}$, anionic)**. The perturbation introduces new *cation-selective* pores. Such pores are lined with fixed negative charges to select for positive ions. These fixed negative charges will electrostatically repel the anionic fluorescein molecule. Therefore, an increase in these pores is not expected to increase the permeability of fluorescein and might even decrease it, depending on the properties of the baseline pores being replaced or supplemented. The effect is certainly not a guaranteed increase.\n- **Probe 2: $4\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ dextran (neutral, macromolecule)**. Paracellular pores formed by claudins are generally small, with radii on the order of angstroms ($4-10\\,\\mathrm{Å}$). They allow for the passage of water, ions, and very small uncharged molecules. A $4\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ dextran is a macromolecule with a hydrodynamic radius typically much larger than this (e.g., $\\sim 14\\,\\mathrm{Å}$). It is therefore too large to pass through these small ion-selective pores. The perturbation, which adds more of these small pores, should **not increase the $P_{\\text{app}}$ for $4\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ dextran**.\n\n**Solvent Drag**\nThis is the convective transport of solutes carried along by a bulk flow of solvent (water). The solute flux due to convection, $J_s^{conv}$, is related to the solvent volume flux, $J_v$, by the equation $J_s^{conv} = J_v (1 - \\sigma_s) \\bar{C}_s$, where $\\sigma_s$ is the solute's reflection coefficient (a measure of how effectively the membrane hinders the solute's passage relative to water) and $\\bar{C}_s$ is the mean solute concentration in the pore. A value of $\\sigma_s = 1$ indicates the solute is completely reflected, while $\\sigma_s = 0$ means it moves with the solvent without hindrance.\nThe experiment imposes an osmotic gradient, which drives a water volume flux $J_v$ across the epithelium. This water flow will \"drag\" any permeant solute (for which $\\sigma_s < 1$) along with it. This process is a direct consequence of bulk flow and does not require an electrical driving force. It is a purely physical phenomenon.\n\nNow we evaluate each option:\n\n**A. TEER is the area-normalized electrical resistance of the monolayer, reporting primarily paracellular ionic conductance; it decreases when cation-selective tight junction pores increase. $P_{\\text{app}}$ is the proportionality linking steady-state diffusive solute flux to the donor concentration under sink conditions; for hydrophilic probes it reports size- and charge-dependent paracellular permeability. Therefore, increasing a cation-selective pore lowers TEER but does not necessarily increase $P_{\\text{app}}$ for an anionic small solute and will not increase $P_{\\text{app}}$ for $4\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ dextran if the pore is too small. Solvent drag is convective solute transport proportional to the solvent volume flux; under an imposed osmotic water flow, the flux of a permeant neutral solute increases even if TEER is unchanged by the osmotic maneuver.**\n\n-   The definition of TEER and the predicted change are **Correct**.\n-   The definition of $P_{\\text{app}}$ and its role in reporting paracellular properties are **Correct**.\n-   The prediction for $P_{\\text{app}}$ of fluorescein (anionic solute) is **Correct**; an increase is not guaranteed due to electrostatic repulsion.\n-   The prediction for $P_{\\text{app}}$ of $4\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ dextran is **Correct**; it will not increase if the pores are too small, which is the case for ion-selective claudin pores.\n-   The definition of solvent drag and its independence from electrical forces is **Correct**.\nThis option is entirely consistent with the first principles and our derivation. Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. TEER is the inverse of $P_{\\text{app}}$ for any solute, so both change identically in magnitude and direction; solvent drag is negligible in epithelia and requires an electrical driving force to manifest. Thus, opening cation-selective tight junction pores increases $P_{\\text{app}}$ for all solutes and equally decreases TEER, and osmotic flow does not alter solute fluxes.**\n\n-   \"TEER is the inverse of $P_{\\text{app}}$ for any solute\" is fundamentally **Incorrect**. TEER measures resistance to ion flow ($\\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2$), while $P_{\\text{app}}$ measures permeability to a specific tracer ($\\mathrm{cm} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). They are different physical quantities.\n-   \"solvent drag is negligible... and requires an electrical driving force\" is **Incorrect**. Solvent drag is a significant mechanism and is driven by hydrostatic or osmotic pressure gradients, not electrical forces.\n-   \"increases $P_{\\text{app}}$ for all solutes\" is **Incorrect**, as it ignores charge and size selectivity.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. TEER measures the density of transcellular ion channels and pumps and is independent of tight junctions; $P_{\\text{app}}$ quantifies only transcellular permeability based on lipid solubility; solvent drag is electrostatic attraction of counterions moving with charged solutes. Thus, increasing a cation-selective tight junction pore does not change TEER or $P_{\\text{app}}$, and osmotic water movement does not change neutral dextran flux.**\n\n-   \"TEER ... is independent of tight junctions\" is profoundly **Incorrect**. The paracellular pathway through tight junctions is a major contributor to total conductance and thus TEER.\n-   \"$P_{\\text{app}}$ quantifies only transcellular permeability\" is **Incorrect**. For the hydrophilic probes used in the problem, $P_{\\text{app}}$ mainly reports on the parellular pathway.\n-   \"solvent drag is electrostatic attraction...\" is an **Incorrect** definition. It is a convective phenomenon.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. TEER measures the number of tight junction strands and is insensitive to ion selectivity; $P_{\\text{app}}$ for a neutral macromolecule increases whenever any paracellular ion conductance increases; solvent drag is vesicular transcytosis enhanced by active transport. Therefore, upregulating a cation-selective pore increases $P_{\\text{app}}$ for $4\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ dextran, leaves TEER unchanged, and increases solvent drag only when adenosine triphosphate is added.**\n\n-   \"TEER ... is insensitive to ion selectivity\" is **Incorrect**. Ion selectivity is a key property of the pores that determines which ions can pass, fundamentally affecting conductance and thus TEER.\n-   \"$P_{\\text{app}}$ for a neutral macromolecule increases whenever any paracellular ion conductance increases\" is **Incorrect**. Ion conductance and macromolecule permeability are distinct properties governed by different pore characteristics (charge/selectivity filter vs. size).\n-   \"solvent drag is vesicular transcytosis\" is a completely **Incorrect** definition of the physical process.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, only option A provides a correct account of all concepts and predictions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2572944"}, {"introduction": "Macroscopic barrier properties like TEER emerge from the intricate molecular architecture of the tight junction. This problem delves into this connection by exploring the role of Zonula Occludens-1 (ZO-1), a critical scaffolding protein that organizes the barrier.

MDCK cells are a canonical model system for studying epithelial barrier function. TEER is the standard metric for quantifying this function.

The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem asks for a prediction based on established qualitative roles and a specific quantitative perturbation. While a precise numerical value for TEER cannot be derived from first principles of physics alone without a specific biophysical model and its parameters, the problem is well-posed within the context of biology. It tests the ability to integrate several key biological concepts—scaffolding, barrier function, and, most importantly, functional redundancy—to predict the most plausible outcome. The quantitative ranges in the options serve to distinguish between different biological regimes (e.g., catastrophic failure vs. moderate impairment vs. full compensation). Such problems are standard in physiology and systems biology.\n-   **Objectivity**: The language is technical and objective. No subjective or ambiguous terminology is used.\n-   **Completeness**: The problem provides sufficient information to reason toward a logical conclusion. The specification that ZO-2, ZO-3, and claudins are unchanged is critical information that constrains the possible outcomes.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It presents a standard scenario in cell physiology that requires qualitative and semi-quantitative reasoning based on established biological principles. I will proceed with the solution derivation.\n\nDerivation of Solution\nTransepithelial Electrical Resistance (TEER), denoted as $R_T$, measures the electrical resistance across a cellular monolayer. For a high-resistance epithelium like MDCK, this resistance is dominated by the paracellular pathway, which is sealed by the tight junctions (TJs). Therefore, we can approximate $R_T \\approx R_{TJ}$, where $R_{TJ}$ is the resistance of the tight junction network.\n\nThe electrical resistance $R_{TJ}$ is the inverse of the electrical conductance, $G_{TJ}$:\n$$R_{TJ} = \\frac{1}{G_{TJ}}$$\nThe conductance $G_{TJ}$ is a measure of the ease with which ions can flow through the paracellular pathway. This flow is primarily governed by the properties of the protein-based strands that form the TJ seal. These strands are polymers of claudin and occludin proteins, and they form a complex network. The overall conductance depends on the number and ion selectivity of pores within the strands, as well as the continuity of the strand network. Discontinuities, breaks, or \"leaks\" in the network provide low-resistance pathways for ion flow, thereby increasing $G_{TJ}$ and decreasing $R_{TJ}$.\n\nThe problem states that ZO proteins (ZO-1, ZO-2, ZO-3) act as scaffolds. Their role is to organize the transmembrane proteins (claudins, occludin) into functional strands and to anchor this entire complex to the perijunctional actomyosin ring. This scaffolding is essential for the structural integrity, continuity, and stability of the TJ barrier.\n\nThe key pieces of information for this problem are:\n1.  ZO-1 expression is reduced by $50\\%$.\n2.  ZO-2 and ZO-3 levels are normal.\n3.  The primary barrier-forming proteins, claudins, are unchanged in abundance or localization.\n\nThis scenario immediately brings to the forefront the principle of **functional redundancy**. ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3 are paralogous proteins with significant overlap in their functions. They can, to a certain extent, compensate for one another. The presence of normal levels of ZO-2 and ZO-3 will buffer the system against the partial loss of ZO-1.\n\nBased on this principle, we can evaluate the possible outcomes:\n-   A catastrophic failure of the barrier is highly unlikely. This would only occur if ZO-1 had an absolutely essential, non-redundant function, or if all ZO proteins were depleted simultaneously. The presence of ZO-2 and ZO-3 will maintain a significant degree of TJ organization and barrier function.\n-   Near-complete compensation is also unlikely. ZO-1 is the first-discovered and a major component of the TJ plaque. A $50\\%$ reduction is a significant perturbation, and it is unreasonable to expect that ZO-2 and ZO-3 can perfectly compensate for this loss. A measurable defect in barrier function should be expected.\n-   A paradoxical increase in TEER has no known biological basis in this context. Losing a key structural protein that stabilizes the barrier should intuitively weaken, not strengthen, it.\n\nTherefore, the most logical prediction is a **moderate impairment** of the barrier function. The TJ scaffolding will be partially compromised, leading to a less continuous and less organized strand network. This would manifest as an increase in the number of strand breaks or discontinuities. These structural defects create additional pathways for ion leakage, increasing the total paracellular conductance $G_{TJ}$ and, consequently, decreasing the TEER, $R_{TJ}$.\n\nTo make a semi-quantitative estimate, let us consider a simplified model where the total scaffolding integrity, $S_{total}$, is the sum of contributions from the three ZO proteins. Assuming for simplicity they contribute roughly equally, $S_{total} \\approx S_{ZO1} + S_{ZO2} + S_{ZO3}$. A $50\\%$ loss of ZO-1 results in a new integrity $S'_{total} \\approx 0.5 S_{ZO1} + S_{ZO2} + S_{ZO3}$. If $S_{ZO1} \\approx S_{ZO2} \\approx S_{ZO3}$, then the fractional change in total integrity is from $3$ units to $2.5$ units, a decrease of $(3-2.5)/3 \\approx 16.7\\%$.\nThe resistance $R_{TJ}$ is plausibly related to the integrity of the scaffold. A simple assumption is that the density of defects is inversely proportional to scaffold integrity, and resistance is inversely proportional to defect density. Thus, $R_{TJ} \\propto S_{total}$. The new TEER, $R'_T$, would be approximately $0.833 \\times R_0 = 833\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^2$.\nIf we assume ZO-1 is slightly more dominant, contributing more to the total scaffold, the effect would be larger. For instance, if ZO-1 contributes $40\\%$ of the scaffolding ($S_{ZO1} = 0.4 S_{total}$) and ZO-2/ZO-3 contribute $30\\%$ each, a $50\\%$ loss of ZO-1 means a total loss of $0.5 \\times 0.4 = 0.2$, or $20\\%$ of the total scaffolding. The TEER would then drop by approximately $20\\%$ to $800\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^2$. If ZO-1 contributed $60\\%$, the loss would be $30\\%$, for a new TEER of $700\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^2$. A drop of $20\\%$ to $35\\%$ is therefore a very reasonable estimate.\nThe increase in the density of discontinuities, $D_{disc}$, can likewise be modeled as inversely proportional to scaffolding integrity: $D'_{disc}/D_{disc} \\approx S_{total}/S'_{total}$. Using the weighted model where ZO-1 represents $60\\%$ of the scaffold, $S'_{total} = 0.7 S_{total}$, so $D'_{disc}/D_{disc} = 1/0.7 \\approx 1.43$. This falls within the range given in Option B.\n\nEvaluation of Options\nA. Catastrophic barrier failure: tight junction strands become highly fragmented with more than $60\\%$ loss of continuity; TEER falls by at least $70\\%$ to below $300\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^2$.\n**Incorrect**. This option ignores the significant compensatory capacity provided by the normal expression of ZO-2 and ZO-3. Experimental evidence from single-knockdown studies in MDCK cells does not show such a drastic collapse. A drop of $\\ge 70\\%$ is characteristic of a much more severe disruption, such as a double knockdown of ZO-1 and ZO-2.\n\nB. Moderate, redundancy-limited impairment: strand continuity is measurably reduced with more free ends and shorter segments; the density of discontinuities increases by approximately $1.3$ to $1.6$ fold; TEER falls by approximately $20\\%$ to $35\\%$ to about $650$ to $800\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^2$.\n**Correct**. This option accurately describes the expected outcome. The term \"redundancy-limited impairment\" correctly identifies the core biological principle. The qualitative description of reduced strand continuity is the correct structural consequence of compromised scaffolding. The quantitative estimates for the increase in discontinuities ($1.3$ to $1.6$ fold) and the decrease in TEER ($20\\%$ to $35\\%$, resulting in a final TEER of $650$ to $800\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^2$ from a baseline of $1000\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^2$) are consistent with both simple biophysical models and published experimental data for ZO-1 knockdown in high-resistance epithelial cells.\n\nC. Near-complete compensation: strand continuity and network topology remain essentially unchanged; TEER changes by less than $5\\%$, remaining near $950$ to $1000\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^2$.\n**Incorrect**. This option overstates the effect of redundancy. While compensation occurs, it is known to be partial. ZO-1 is a sufficiently important component that a $50\\%$ loss will produce a measurable biophysical defect. A change of less than $5\\%$ is too small and would imply that ZO-1's scaffolding role is almost entirely dispensable, which is not the case.\n\nD. Paradoxical tightening: strands elongate and junctional meshes become more continuous; TEER increases by approximately $10\\%$ to $20\\%$ to about $1100$ to $1200\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^2$.\n**Incorrect**. This outcome is biologically counter-intuitive and contradicts the known function of ZO-1. As a key organizer and stabilizer of the TJ complex, its partial loss should lead to disorganization and increased leakiness (lower TEER), not enhanced organization and decreased leakiness (higher TEER).

The following experimentally measured quantities are obtained under steady-state, iso-osmotic conditions with negligible solvent drag and negligible transcellular transport of the probes:\n\n- TEER: $R_{t} = 800 \\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^{2}$.\n- Apparent permeability coefficients (apical-to-basolateral) for neutral dextrans:\n  - $P_{4} = 1.60 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{cm} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for $4 \\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ dextran.\n  - $P_{70} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{cm} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for $70 \\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ dextran.\n\nAssume the following, grounded in well-established epithelial transport principles:\n- Fick’s law for each pathway: for a solute with concentration difference $\\Delta C$, flux $J = P \\, \\Delta C$.\n- For parallel pathways subject to the same $\\Delta C$, total flux equals the sum of pathway fluxes.\n- $70 \\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ dextran is excluded from the pore pathway and therefore traverses only the leak pathway.\n- TEER reflects the parallel-sum of ionic conductances of the two pathways, $G_{t} = 1/R_{t} = G_{\\mathrm{pore}} + G_{\\mathrm{leak}}$, but you may treat ionic conductance and non-electrolyte permeability as pathway-specific properties that add in parallel for their respective driving forces.\n\nUsing these data and assumptions within a two-pathway parallel conductance model, compute the relative contributions (as decimal fractions) of the pore pathway and the leak pathway to the overall apical-to-basolateral $4 \\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ dextran flux under the given conditions.

Round your answer to three significant figures. The final fractions are dimensionless; do not include units in your final numeric answer.", "solution": "The problem will first be subjected to a rigorous validation process.\n\nStep 1: Extract Givens.\nThe problem provides the following data and assumptions:\n- A model of intestinal epithelial transport with two parallel pathways: a \"pore\" pathway and a \"leak\" pathway.\n- Total transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER): $R_{t} = 800 \\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^{2}$.\n- Apparent permeability coefficient for $4 \\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ dextran: $P_{4} = 1.60 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{cm} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n- Apparent permeability coefficient for $70 \\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ dextran: $P_{70} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{cm} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n- Fick's law applies: $J = P \\, \\Delta C$.\n- For parallel pathways, total flux is the sum of pathway fluxes.\n- The $70 \\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ dextran traverses only the leak pathway.\n- Total ionic conductance is the sum of pathway conductances: $G_{t} = 1/R_{t} = G_{\\mathrm{pore}} + G_{\\mathrm{leak}}$. This model of parallel addition applies to non-electrolyte permeability as well.\n- Conditions are steady-state, iso-osmotic, with negligible solvent drag and negligible transcellular transport.\n\nStep 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens.\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on the well-established two-pathway model of epithelial paracellular transport, a cornerstone of epithelial physiology. The use of TEER and neutral tracers (dextrans) of different sizes to probe pathway properties is a standard experimental technique. The values provided for TEER and permeabilities are realistic for cultured epithelial monolayers. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides sufficient data and a clear set of assumptions to determine a unique solution for the requested quantities.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and objective language, free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the fractional contributions of the \"pore\" and \"leak\" pathways to the total flux of a $4 \\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ dextran molecule.\n\nThe total flux, $J_{\\mathrm{total}}$, across the epithelium is the sum of the fluxes through the parallel pathways. According to Fick's law, the flux $J$ of a solute is proportional to its permeability coefficient $P$ and the concentration difference $\\Delta C$. For a solute passing through both pathways, the total flux $J_{4}$ is:\n$$ J_{4} = J_{4, \\mathrm{pore}} + J_{4, \\mathrm{leak}} $$\nSubstituting Fick's law, and given that the concentration difference $\\Delta C$ is the same for both pathways:\n$$ P_{4} \\Delta C = P_{4, \\mathrm{pore}} \\Delta C + P_{4, \\mathrm{leak}} \\Delta C $$\nDividing by $\\Delta C$, we find that the total apparent permeability is the sum of the permeabilities of the individual pathways:\n$$ P_{4} = P_{4, \\mathrm{pore}} + P_{4, \\mathrm{leak}} $$\nHere, $P_{4}$ is the measured total permeability of the $4 \\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ dextran, $P_{4, \\mathrm{pore}}$ is its permeability through the pore pathway, and $P_{4, \\mathrm{leak}}$ is its permeability through the leak pathway.\n\nThe problem states that the larger $70 \\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ dextran is excluded from the pore pathway. This means its entire flux occurs through the leak pathway. Therefore, the measured apparent permeability of the $70 \\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ dextran, $P_{70}$, is equal to the permeability of the leak pathway for this molecule:\n$$ P_{70} = P_{70, \\mathrm{leak}} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{cm} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThe problem is constructed such that the permeability of the leak pathway is characterized by this larger, pore-excluded tracer. A standard simplification in this type of analysis is to assume that the permeability of the leak pathway is the same for both the $4 \\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ and $70 \\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ dextrans. This is an operational definition inherent to the experimental design, where a large tracer quantifies the 'leak' component. Therefore, we set the permeability of the leak pathway for the $4 \\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ dextran equal to the measured permeability of the $70 \\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ dextran:\n$$ P_{4, \\mathrm{leak}} = P_{70} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{cm} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nNow we can calculate the permeability of the pore pathway for the $4 \\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ dextran by rearranging the summation equation:\n$$ P_{4, \\mathrm{pore}} = P_{4} - P_{4, \\mathrm{leak}} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ P_{4, \\mathrm{pore}} = (1.60 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{cm} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) - (2.00 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{cm} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) $$\nTo perform the subtraction, we express the numbers with the same power of $10$:\n$$ P_{4, \\mathrm{pore}} = (1.60 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{cm} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) - (0.20 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{cm} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = 1.40 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{cm} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThe problem asks for the relative contributions (fractions) of each pathway to the total $4 \\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ dextran flux. The fraction of flux through a given pathway is the ratio of the flux through that pathway to the total flux.\nThe fraction through the pore pathway, $f_{\\mathrm{pore}}$, is:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{pore}} = \\frac{J_{4, \\mathrm{pore}}}{J_{4}} = \\frac{P_{4, \\mathrm{pore}} \\Delta C}{P_{4} \\Delta C} = \\frac{P_{4, \\mathrm{pore}}}{P_{4}} $$\nAnd the fraction through the leak pathway, $f_{\\mathrm{leak}}$, is:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{leak}} = \\frac{J_{4, \\mathrm{leak}}}{J_{4}} = \\frac{P_{4, \\mathrm{leak}} \\Delta C}{P_{4} \\Delta C} = \\frac{P_{4, \\mathrm{leak}}}{P_{4}} $$\nWe now compute these fractions:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{pore}} = \\frac{1.40 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{cm} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1.60 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{cm} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{1.40}{1.60} = \\frac{14}{16} = \\frac{7}{8} = 0.875 $$\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{leak}} = \\frac{2.00 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{cm} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1.60 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{cm} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.20 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{cm} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1.60 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{cm} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.20}{1.60} = \\frac{2}{16} = \\frac{1}{8} = 0.125 $$\nAs a check, the fractions sum to unity: $f_{\\mathrm{pore}} + f_{\\mathrm{leak}} = 0.875 + 0.125 = 1.000$. The results are exact to three decimal places, which satisfies the requirement for three significant figures.\n\nThe provided value for TEER, $R_{t} = 800 \\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^{2}$, serves to establish the context of a parallel transport model but its numerical value is not required for calculating the fractional fluxes of the neutral dextran molecules. The calculation is self-contained with the permeability data alone.\n\nThe final answer is to be expressed as a row vector $(f_{\\mathrm{pore}} \\ \\ f_{\\mathrm{leak}})$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.875 & 0.125 \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "2572954"}]}
