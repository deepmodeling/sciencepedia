The number $625$ already consists of three significant figures.\n\nIt is instructive to compare this result with the diameter a myelinated axon would require to achieve the same velocity.

Each presynaptic action potential engages a set of anatomically defined release sites, with the number of functionally available sites denoted by $n$, and the per-site release probability for acetylcholine (ACh) denoted by $p$. The mean quantal content is $m = np$. Each quantum produces a postsynaptic endplate depolarization of amplitude $q$ (the quantal size), assumed constant across quanta and fibers. Across identical stimuli, release is modeled as a Poisson process, so that the number of released quanta has mean $m$ and variance $m$. For a given stimulus, the endplate potential amplitude is the sum over released quanta and, for large $m$, its distribution can be approximated by a Gaussian with mean $\\mu = mq$ and variance $\\sigma^{2} = mq^{2}$. A postsynaptic muscle fiber generates an action potential if and only if its endplate potential exceeds a fixed threshold $V_{\\mathrm{thr}}$.
