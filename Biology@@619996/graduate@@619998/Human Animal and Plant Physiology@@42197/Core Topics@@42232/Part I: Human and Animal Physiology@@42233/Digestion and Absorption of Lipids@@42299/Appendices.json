It contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The task is to calculate the total amount of free fatty acids (FFA) released upon complete enzymatic hydrolysis of a given lipid mixture.\n\nThe fundamental principle is the stoichiometry of ester bond hydrolysis. The problem states that complete hydrolysis of each ester linkage liberates one molecule of a free fatty acid. Therefore, the total moles of FFA produced, denoted as $n_{\\text{FFA, total}}$, is the sum of the moles of FFA released from each of the three lipid classes present in the emulsion: triacylglycerol (TAG), cholesteryl ester (CE), and phosphatidylcholine (PC).\n$$ n_{\\text{FFA, total}} = n_{\\text{FFA, TAG}} + n_{\\text{FFA, CE}} + n_{\\text{FFA, PC}} $$\nThe moles of FFA released from each lipid component ($n_{\\text{FFA}, i}$) is the product of the number of moles of that lipid ($n_i$) and the number of fatty acyl ester bonds per molecule ($k_i$) that are hydrolyzed to yield an FFA.\n$$ n_{\\text{FFA}, i} = k_i \\times n_i $$\nThe number of moles of each lipid, $n_i$, is calculated from its given mass, $m_i$, and molar mass, $M_i$:\n$$ n_i = \\frac{m_i}{M_i} $$\n\nFirst, we must determine the value of $k_i$ for each lipid class based on its molecular structure.\n1.  **Triacylglycerol (TAG)**: A triacylglycerol molecule consists of a glycerol backbone esterified with three fatty acid molecules. The specific molecule is triolein. Thus, upon complete hydrolysis, each molecule of TAG yields three molecules of FFA. Therefore, $k_{\\text{TAG}} = 3$.\n2.  **Cholesteryl Ester (CE)**: A cholesteryl ester molecule consists of a cholesterol molecule esterified with a single fatty acid. The specific molecule is cholesteryl oleate. Complete hydrolysis of one molecule of CE yields one molecule of FFA. Therefore, $k_{\\text{CE}} = 1$.\n3.  **Phosphatidylcholine (PC)**: The specific molecule is 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. This is a glycerophospholipid. The name indicates that fatty acids (palmitic acid) are esterified at the $sn-1$ and $sn-2$ positions of the glycerol backbone. The $sn-3$ position is attached to a phosphocholine head group. The problem specifies that \"all fatty acyl groups originally esterified are liberated as FFA,\" which directs us to count only the ester bonds linking fatty acids to the glycerol. There are two such bonds. Therefore, $k_{\\text{PC}} = 2$.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles for each lipid substrate using the provided data.

Bile salt concentration in the intestinal lumen is above the critical micelle concentration. Consider two scenarios in the proximal small intestine: control and administration of a potent inhibitor of pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase (PTL) that prevents productive binding of PTL to the lipid–water interface. Assume the following foundational facts that are well established:\n\n- Pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase (PTL) with colipase hydrolyzes ester bonds at the $sn\\text{-}1$ and $sn\\text{-}3$ positions of TAG, yielding predominantly 2-monoacylglycerol (2-MAG) and two long-chain free fatty acids (LC-FFA); minor complete hydrolysis can yield glycerol. Lingual and gastric lipases can hydrolyze predominantly the $sn\\text{-}3$ position, generating LC-FFA and $1,2$-diacylglycerol (DAG), with little $2$-MAG or glycerol.\n- Conservation of mass applies: at any time, the luminal rate of appearance of digestion products equals the net enzymatic generation rate minus the net absorptive removal rate.\n- Mixed micelles of bile salts with amphipathic lipids (LC-FFA and $2$-MAG) are required for efficient uptake of long-chain species by enterocytes; intact TAG and DAG do not meaningfully partition into mixed micelles under physiological conditions. Glycerol is water soluble and does not require micelles.\n- To first approximation near steady state, the absorptive flux $J$ of an absorbable lipid species is proportional to its mixed micellar concentration at the brush border, $J = k \\, C_{\\mathrm{micelle}}$, where $k$ is an effective mass transfer coefficient. For glycerol in the aqueous phase, $J_{\\mathrm{gly}} = k_{\\mathrm{gly}} \\, C_{\\mathrm{gly,aq}}$.\n- The inhibitor reduces the catalytic efficiency of PTL to a small fraction of control without directly altering bile salt levels, gastric lipase activity, or enterocyte transport capacity.\n\nBased on these principles and stoichiometry, predict the qualitative consequences of PTL inhibition for the luminal distribution among $2$-MAG, LC-FFA, and glycerol, and for the absorptive fluxes of $2$-MAG and LC-FFA. Which option best captures the expected pattern in the proximal small intestine?\n\nA. With inhibitor: luminal $2$-MAG falls toward negligible values; luminal LC-FFA also declines but, relative to $2$-MAG, the mixture is enriched in LC-FFA derived from gastric lipase; luminal glycerol declines. Mixed micelle concentration decreases, so absorptive fluxes of both $2$-MAG and LC-FFA decrease despite unchanged bile salt levels.\n\nB. With inhibitor: luminal $2$-MAG accumulates because it is not absorbed efficiently without PTL; luminal LC-FFA increases; luminal glycerol rises and is rapidly absorbed; absorptive fluxes are maintained by micellar equilibrium since bile salts are unchanged.\n\nC. With inhibitor: luminal $2$-MAG decreases, but LC-FFA increases because reduced enterocyte re-esterification leaves more LC-FFA in the lumen; luminal glycerol is unchanged; LC-FFA absorption is largely unchanged because it proceeds by simple diffusion independent of micelles.\n\nD. With inhibitor: luminal $2$-MAG and LC-FFA both decrease, and luminal glycerol decreases, but the absorptive flux of LC-FFA is increased because bile salts upregulate mixed micellar solubility in response to the higher TAG load even without increased LC-FFA production.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. It provides a clear and accurate description of the physiological and biochemical processes involved in lipid digestion and absorption. The premises are based on established facts of gastrointestinal physiology, and the question asks for a logical deduction of the consequences of a specific perturbation—the inhibition of pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase (PTL). Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe core of the problem is to compare the process of lipid digestion and absorption under two conditions: a control scenario and a scenario with a potent inhibitor of PTL. Let us analyze the system based on the provided principles.\n\n**1. The Control Scenario (Normal Digestion)**\n\nIn the proximal small intestine, dietary long-chain triacylglycerols ($\\text{TAG}$), which have been emulsified into small lipid droplets, are acted upon by two main types of lipases.\n- Gastric lipase, active in the stomach and continuing its action in the duodenum, hydrolyzes the $sn-3$ ester bond of a $\\text{TAG}$ molecule. This reaction produces one molecule of a long-chain free fatty acid ($\\text{LC-FFA}$) and one molecule of $1,2$-diacylglycerol ($1,2$-$\\text{DAG}$).\n- The primary digestive enzyme in the small intestine is pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase ($\\text{PTL}$), which, in complex with its cofactor colipase, binds to the lipid-water interface of the emulsion droplets. $\\text{PTL}$ hydrolyzes the ester bonds at the $sn-1$ and $sn-3$ positions of $\\text{TAG}$. This process predominantly yields one molecule of $2$-monoacylglycerol ($2$-$\\text{MAG}$) and two molecules of $\\text{LC-FFA}$. Minor complete hydrolysis to glycerol and three $\\text{LC-FFA}$ molecules can also occur.\n\nThe amphipathic products of digestion, primarily $2$-$\\text{MAG}$ and $\\text{LC-FFA}$, are then incorporated into mixed micelles along with bile salts. The concentration of these species in the mixed micellar phase at the brush border membrane of the enterocytes drives their absorption. The problem defines this relationship as an absorptive flux $J$ proportional to the micellar concentration $C_{\\mathrm{micelle}}$, via $J = k \\, C_{\\mathrm{micelle}}$. Intact $\\text{TAG}$ and $\\text{DAG}$ are not significantly absorbed as they do not partition into micelles. Glycerol, being water-soluble, is absorbed from the aqueous phase.\n\n**2. The Inhibitor Scenario (PTL Inhibition)**\n\nA potent inhibitor is introduced that prevents $\\text{PTL}$ from binding to the lipid-water interface, thus drastically reducing its catalytic efficiency. The inhibitor does not affect gastric lipase activity, bile salt levels, or the enterocyte's intrinsic transport capacity (represented by the coefficient $k$).\n\nLet us analyze the consequences step-by-step:\n\n- **Enzymatic Generation of Products**:\n  - The activity of $\\text{PTL}$, the main enzyme for $\\text{TAG}$ digestion, is severely reduced. Consequently, the rate of generation of its primary products, $2$-$\\text{MAG}$ and $\\text{LC-FFA}$s (in a $1:2$ molar ratio from this source), will plummet.\n  - The generation of glycerol, a minor product of $\\text{PTL}$ action, will also decrease.\n  - The activity of gastric lipase is unchanged. It will continue to hydrolyze $\\text{TAG}$ at the $sn-3$ position, producing $1,2$-$\\text{DAG}$ and $\\text{LC-FFA}$. However, gastric lipase accounts for a smaller fraction of total $\\text{TAG}$ hydrolysis compared to $\\text{PTL}$ in the control state.\n\n- **Luminal Concentrations of Digestion Products**:\n  - **$2$-$\\text{MAG}$**: Since $\\text{PTL}$ is the predominant source of $2$-$\\text{MAG}$, and its action is now inhibited, the rate of $2$-$\\text{MAG}$ generation will fall to nearly zero. According to the conservation of mass principle, the luminal concentration is determined by the balance between generation and removal (absorption). With generation ceasing, the existing $2$-$\\text{MAG}$ will be absorbed, and its luminal concentration will drop to negligible values.\n  - **$\\text{LC-FFA}$**: $\\text{PTL}$ is the source of approximately two-thirds of the $\\text{LC-FFA}$ generated from each $\\text{TAG}$ molecule that is fully processed in the small intestine. Gastric lipase contributes the other one-third (approximately). By inhibiting the major pathway (PTL), the overall rate of $\\text{LC-FFA}$ generation is significantly decreased. As with $2$-$\\text{MAG}$, this sharp reduction in production will lead to a correspondingly sharp decrease in the luminal concentration of $\\text{LC-FFA}$.\n  - **Enrichment in $\\text{LC-FFA}$ relative to $2$-$\\text{MAG}$**: In the control state, $\\text{PTL}$ produces both $2$-$\\text{MAG}$ and $\\text{LC-FFA}$. With the inhibitor, the only significant remaining digestive activity is from gastric lipase, which produces $\\text{LC-FFA}$ but essentially no $2$-$\\text{MAG}$. Therefore, the small pool of newly generated digestion products will be composed almost entirely of $\\text{LC-FFA}$ and $1,2$-$\\text{DAG}$, meaning the mixture is highly enriched in $\\text{LC-FFA}$ relative to the vanishingly small amount of $2$-$\\text{MAG}$.\n  - **Glycerol**: Being a minor byproduct of $\\text{PTL}$ action, its already low rate of generation will decrease even further. Consequently, its luminal concentration will decline.\n\n- **Micelle Formation and Absorptive Flux**:\n  - Mixed micelles are required for the efficient absorption of long-chain lipids. Their formation depends on the availability of amphipathic lipids, namely $2$-$\\text{MAG}$ and $\\text{LC-FFA}$, to be solubilized by bile salts.\n  - Since the luminal concentrations of both $2$-$\\text{MAG}$ and $\\text{LC-FFA}$ have dramatically decreased, the concentration of these lipids partitioning into the mixed micelles ($C_{\\mathrm{micelle}}$) will also decrease significantly. The bile salt concentration is unchanged, but there are far fewer lipid products to form micelles with.\n  - The absorptive flux $J$ is given by $J = k \\, C_{\\mathrm{micelle}}$. The mass transfer coefficient $k$ is unchanged. Because $C_{\\mathrm{micelle}}$ for both $2$-$\\text{MAG}$ and $\\text{LC-FFA}$ is reduced, the absorptive fluxes for both species must decrease.\n\n**Summary of Predictions for the Inhibitor Scenario:**\n- Luminal $2$-$\\text{MAG}$ concentration: Decreases to negligible levels.\n- Luminal $\\text{LC-FFA}$ concentration: Decreases significantly.\n- Luminal Glycerol concentration: Decreases.\n- Relative composition: The mixture of absorbable products becomes enriched in $\\text{LC-FFA}$ relative to $2$-$\\text{MAG}$.\n- Mixed micelle lipid concentration: Decreases.\n- Absorptive flux of both $2$-$\\text{MAG}$ and $\\text{LC-FFA}$: Decreases.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options based on this analysis.\n\n**A. With inhibitor: luminal $2$-$\\text{MAG}$ falls toward negligible values; luminal LC-FFA also declines but, relative to $2$-$\\text{MAG}$, the mixture is enriched in LC-FFA derived from gastric lipase; luminal glycerol declines. Mixed micelle concentration decreases, so absorptive fluxes of both $2$-$\\text{MAG}$ and LC-FFA decrease despite unchanged bile salt levels.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with all points of our derivation. The decrease in $2$-$\\text{MAG}$, $\\text{LC-FFA}$, and glycerol is correctly predicted. The relative enrichment of $\\text{LC-FFA}$ from the action of gastric lipase is also correctly identified. The consequence for micellar concentration and absorptive fluxes is also correct. This option accurately describes the situation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. With inhibitor: luminal $2$-$\\text{MAG}$ accumulates because it is not absorbed efficiently without PTL; luminal LC-FFA increases; luminal glycerol rises and is rapidly absorbed; absorptive fluxes are maintained by micellar equilibrium since bile salts are unchanged.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. Accumulation of a substance requires its rate of production to exceed its rate of removal. Here, the production of $2$-$\\text{MAG}$ and $\\text{LC-FFA}$ is inhibited, so they cannot accumulate; their concentrations must fall. The claim that absorptive fluxes are maintained is also incorrect, as flux depends on the concentration of absorbable species, which has decreased.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. With inhibitor: luminal $2$-$\\text{MAG}$ decreases, but LC-FFA increases because reduced enterocyte re-esterification leaves more LC-FFA in the lumen; luminal glycerol is unchanged; LC-FFA absorption is largely unchanged because it proceeds by simple diffusion independent of micelles.**\nThis option contains multiple errors. The claim that $\\text{LC-FFA}$ increases is incorrect; its primary production pathway is blocked. The reasoning about re-esterification is backwards; reduced absorption provides less, not more, substrate for re-esterification. The assertion that $\\text{LC-FFA}$ absorption is independent of micelles directly contradicts a foundational fact given in the problem statement (\"Mixed micelles...are required for efficient uptake of long-chain species\").\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. With inhibitor: luminal $2$-$\\text{MAG}$ and LC-FFA both decrease, and luminal glycerol decreases, but the absorptive flux of LC-FFA is increased because bile salts upregulate mixed micellar solubility in response to the higher TAG load even without increased LC-FFA production.**\nThis option correctly states that luminal concentrations of products decrease. However, it incorrectly claims that the absorptive flux of $\\text{LC-FFA}$ is increased. This is a direct contradiction: if the generation of a substance is reduced, its subsequent flux cannot increase. The reasoning provided is nonsensical; bile salts do not \"upregulate\" solubility in this manner, and even if they did, there are fewer $\\text{LC-FFA}$ molecules to be absorbed, so flux must decrease. The higher $\\text{TAG}$ load remains in the lumen precisely because it is not being digested.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis of the provided physiological principles, option A is the only one that correctly predicts the consequences of PTL inhibition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2562340"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal of physiological science is not just to describe but to predict.

Thus, the solution for the remaining mass is:\n$$\nM(T) = K_m \\cdot W\\left( \\frac{F}{K_m} \\exp\\left( \\frac{F}{K_m} - \\frac{V_{\\max}(E) T}{K_m} \\right) \\right)\n$$\nwhere $W$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function, as mass must be real and positive. The total mass of hydrolyzed product over time $T$ is then $H = F - M(T)$.\n\n**Step 2: Modeling Absorption of Hydrolyzed Products**\n\nThe absorption of hydrolyzed products is limited by their solubilization in bile acid micelles. The maximal absorbable quantity, $B$, is determined by the effective bile acid concentration above the critical micelle concentration ($C_{\\mathrm{CMC}}$).\nThe effective bile acid concentration is $C_{\\mathrm{bile,eff}} = (1-S) \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{bile}}^{(0)}$, where $S$ is the fraction of sequestered bile acids.\nThe maximal absorption rate is:\n$$\nA_{\\max} = \\gamma \\cdot \\max(C_{\\mathrm{bile,eff}} - C_{\\mathrm{CMC}}, 0) \\cdot L_{\\mathrm{eff}}\n$$\nOver the residence time $T$, the total solubilization-limited absorption capacity is $B = A_{\\max} \\cdot T$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating Absorbed and Fecal Fat**\n\nThe amount of fat actually absorbed, $A$, is limited by both the amount hydrolyzed and the capacity for solubilization. Therefore, the absorbed mass is the minimum of these two quantities:\n$$\nA = \\min(H, B) = \\min(F - M(T), B)\n$$\nThe unabsorbed fat is excreted. The daily fecal fat is thus:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Feces} = F - A\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Quantifying Multiplicative Interaction**\n\nTo assess the interaction between pancreatic insufficiency ($E < 1$) and bile acid sequestration ($S > 0$), we compute the multiplicative impact index, $\\mu$. This requires calculating the fecal fat fraction, $f = \\mathrm{Feces}/F$, under three conditions for each parameter set $(F, E, S, T)$:\n1.  Both defects present ($f_{\\mathrm{ES}}$): Calculated with the given $E$ and $S$.\n2.  Enzyme defect alone ($f_{\\mathrm{E}}$): Calculated with the given $E$ but setting $S=0$.\n3.  Sequestration defect alone ($f_{\\mathrm{S}}$): Calculated with the given $S$ but setting $E=1$.\n\nThe Bliss-independence model predicts a combined effect assuming no interaction:\n$$\ne_{\\mathrm{indep}} = f_{\\mathrm{E}} + f_{\\mathrm{S}} - f_{\\mathrm{E}} f_{\\mathrm{S}}\n$$\nThe multiplicative impact index $\\mu$ compares the observed combined effect to this prediction:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{ES}}}{e_{\\mathrm{indep}}}\n$$\nA value of $\\mu > 1$ suggests synergy (effect is greater than expected), $\\mu < 1$ suggests antagonism (effect is less than expected), and $\\mu = 1$ suggests the effects are independent. If $e_{\\mathrm{indep}} = 0$, $\\mu$ is defined as $1$.\n\n**Computational Algorithm**\n\nFor each test case with parameters $(F, E, S, T)$ and constants $V_{\\max}^{(0)}, K_m, C_{\\mathrm{bile}}^{(0)}, C_{\\mathrm{CMC}}, L_{\\mathrm{eff}}, \\gamma$:\n1.  Define a function that takes $(F, E, S, T)$ as input and performs the following calculations:\n    a. Calculate $V_{\\max}(E) = E \\cdot V_{\\max}^{(0)}$.\n    b. Calculate $M(T)$ using the Lambert W function solution.\n    c. Calculate hydrolyzed mass $H = F - M(T)$.\n    d. Calculate $C_{\\mathrm{bile,eff}} = (1-S) \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{bile}}^{(0)}$.\n    e. Calculate absorption capacity $B = \\gamma \\cdot \\max(C_{\\mathrm{bile,eff}} - C_{\\mathrm{CMC}}, 0) \\cdot L_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\cdot T$.\n    f. Calculate absorbed mass $A = \\min(H, B)$.\n    g. Return fecal fat $\\mathrm{Feces} = F - A$ and fecal fat fraction $f = (F-A)/F$.\n2.  Call this function three times:\n    a. For $(F, E, S, T)$ to get $\\mathrm{Feces}_{\\mathrm{ES}}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{ES}}$.\n    b. For $(F, E, 0, T)$ to get $f_{\\mathrm{E}}$.\n    c. For $(F, 1, S, T)$ to get $f_{\\mathrm{S}}$.\n3.  Calculate $e_{\\mathrm{indep}} = f_{\\mathrm{E}} + f_{\\mathrm{S}} - f_{\\mathrm{E}} f_{\\mathrm{S}}$.\n4.  Calculate $\\mu = f_{\\mathrm{ES}} / e_{\\mathrm{indep}}$ if $e_{\\mathrm{indep}} > 0$, else $\\mu = 1$.\n5.  Round $\\mathrm{Feces}_{\\mathrm{ES}}$ and $\\mu$ to $3$ decimal places. Store the pair $[\\mathrm{Feces}_{\\mathrm{ES}}, \\mu]$.\n6.
