Fluid movement across the capillary wall is governed by the balance of hydrostatic and oncotic forces acting across a semipermeable barrier, with the volumetric flux of solvent proportional to the net driving pressure. The proportionality constant is the ultrafiltration coefficient, which equals hydraulic conductivity times area. The barrier is only partially reflective to plasma proteins, so the effective contribution of the colloid osmotic gradient is attenuated by the osmotic reflection coefficient.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The provided parameters are physiologically plausible. Therefore, the problem is valid and I will proceed with its solution.\n\nThe task is to derive the expression for the net volumetric flux, $J_{v}$, and then compute its value. The derivation must be based on the two mechanistic principles provided.\n\nPrinciple (i) states that the solvent flux, $J_{v}$, is linearly proportional to a net driving pressure, which we can denote as $P_{net}$. The proportionality constant is given as the ultrafiltration coefficient, $K_{f}$. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$J_{v} = K_{f} \\cdot P_{net}$$\n\nThe net driving pressure, $P_{net}$, is the algebraic sum of the hydrostatic and colloid osmotic (oncotic) pressures exerted across the capillary wall. We adopt the convention that pressures promoting filtration (fluid movement from capillary to interstitium) are positive contributions to $P_{net}$.\n\nThe hydrostatic pressure gradient across the capillary wall is the difference between the capillary hydrostatic pressure, $P_{c}$, and the interstitial hydrostatic pressure, $P_{i}$. This gradient, $\\Delta P = P_{c} - P_{i}$, drives fluid out of the capillary and thus contributes positively to $P_{net}$.\n\nThe colloid osmotic pressure gradient is the difference between the capillary oncotic pressure, $\\pi_{c}$, and the interstitial oncotic pressure, $\\pi_{i}$. This gradient, $\\Delta \\pi = \\pi_{c} - \\pi_{i}$, is generated by plasma proteins that are more concentrated inside the capillary. This gradient tends to draw fluid *into* the capillary, opposing filtration. Therefore, its contribution to the net filtration pressure is negative.\n\nPrinciple (ii) states that the effective oncotic contribution is attenuated by the osmotic reflection coefficient, $\\sigma$. The reflection coefficient accounts for the partial permeability of the capillary wall to the solutes. A value of $\\sigma = 1$ would imply a perfectly semipermeable membrane, exerting the full theoretical osmotic pressure difference. A value of $\\sigma = 0$ would imply free permeability, resulting in no osmotic effect. Therefore, the effective oncotic pressure gradient that opposes filtration is not simply $\\Delta \\pi$, but rather $\\sigma \\Delta \\pi = \\sigma (\\pi_{c} - \\pi_{i})$.\n\nCombining these components, the net driving pressure, $P_{net}$, is the hydrostatic pressure gradient favoring filtration minus the effective oncotic pressure gradient opposing filtration:\n$$P_{net} = (P_{c} - P_{i}) - \\sigma (\\pi_{c} - \\pi_{i})$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $P_{net}$ into our initial proportionality relation gives the complete derived expression for the net volumetric flux, which is the Starling equation:\n$$J_{v} = K_{f} \\left[ (P_{c} - P_{i}) - \\sigma (\\pi_{c} - \\pi_{i}) \\right]$$\n\nNow, we must compute the numerical value of $J_{v}$ using the provided parameters:\n$P_{c} = 30\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n$P_{i} = -2\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n$\\pi_{c} = 25\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n$\\pi_{i} = 5\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n$\\sigma = 0.9$\n$K_{f} = 0.02\\ \\mathrm{ml}\\cdot\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{mmHg}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the net driving pressure, $P_{net}$:\n$$P_{net} = (30 - (-2)) - 0.9 \\cdot (25 - 5)$$\n$$P_{net} = (30 + 2) - 0.9 \\cdot (20)$$\n$$P_{net} = 32 - 18$$\n$$P_{net} = 14\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$$\n\nThe positive sign of $P_{net}$ indicates that the net force favors filtration.\n\nNext, we calculate the volumetric flux, $J_{v}$, by multiplying the net pressure by the ultrafiltration coefficient:\n$$J_{v} = K_{f} \\cdot P_{net}$$\n$$J_{v} = (0.02\\ \\mathrm{ml}\\cdot\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{mmHg}^{-1}) \\cdot (14\\ \\mathrm{mmHg})$$\n$$J_{v} = 0.28\\ \\mathrm{ml}\\cdot\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to two significant figures.
