Interpret the result in the context of thermal inertia and thermoregulation.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on the fundamental principles of thermodynamics (the First Law) and the definition of heat capacity, applied to a standard, simplified model in biophysics. The provided numerical values for mass ($m = 70\\ \\mathrm{kg}$), specific heat capacity ($c = 3.5\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ kg^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$), and temperature change ($\\Delta T = 1\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$) are physically realistic for a human. The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary information and clearly stated assumptions to allow for a unique solution. It does not violate any points on the invalidity checklist.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the energy balance of a closed system is the First Law of Thermodynamics:\n$$\n\\Delta U = Q - W\n$$\nHere, $\\Delta U$ represents the change in the internal energy of the system, $Q$ is the net heat added to the system, and $W$ is the net work done by the system on its surroundings.\n\nThe problem statement provides two critical constraints for the system over the short interval in question. First, mechanical work is negligible, which implies $W = 0$. Second, heat exchange with the environment is neglected. Thus, the heat term $Q$ represents only the heat that must be added internally to the system to cause the temperature change. Under these conditions, the First Law simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Delta U = Q\n$$\nThis equation indicates that the change in the system's internal energy is equal to the heat added.\n\nThe definition of mass-specific isobaric heat capacity, $c$, relates the heat added to a substance of mass $m$ to the resulting change in its temperature $\\Delta T$ under constant pressure:\n$$\nQ = m c \\Delta T\n$$\nCombining these two fundamental relations, we derive the required relationship linking the heat input to the change in internal energy and temperature:\n$$\n\\Delta U = Q = m c \\Delta T\n$$\nThis derived relationship shows that for a system with negligible work and external heat exchange, the change in internal energy is directly proportional to the change in temperature, with the constant of proportionality being the product of mass and specific heat capacity, $mc$. This product is the total heat capacity of the body.\n\nWe are now prepared to compute the numerical value for the heat $Q$ required to produce the specified temperature rise. The givens are:\n-   $m = 70\\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n-   $c = 3.5\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ kg^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$\n-   $\\Delta T = 1\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n\nIt is critical to note that a change in temperature of $1$ degree Celsius is equivalent to a change in temperature of $1$ Kelvin. Therefore, $\\Delta T = 1\\ \\mathrm{K}$. The units are consistent for calculation.\n\nSubstituting the values into the equation for heat input:\n$$\nQ = (70\\ \\mathrm{kg}) \\times (3.5\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ kg^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}) \\times (1\\ \\mathrm{K})\n$$\n$$\nQ = (70 \\times 3.5)\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\n$$\n$$\nQ = 245\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\n$$\nThe calculated result, $245\\ \\mathrm{kJ}$, has exactly three significant figures as required.\n\nFinally, we interpret the magnitude of this result. The value of $245\\ \\mathrm{kJ}$ is a substantial quantity of energy. This magnitude is a direct consequence of the large total heat capacity ($mc$) of the organism, a property referred to as **thermal inertia**. The high specific heat of water, the primary constituent of biological tissues, is the reason for this large thermal inertia. This property is not a weakness; it is a critical feature for homeostasis in endotherms. A large thermal inertia acts as a thermal buffer, ensuring that the core body temperature does not undergo rapid, dangerous fluctuations in response to transient changes in metabolic heat production or environmental heat load. This slowness provides the necessary time for physiological thermoregulatory mechanisms—such as sweating (evaporative cooling) and vasodilation (convective/radiative cooling)—to be activated and effectively counteract the thermal disturbance. In essence, the high heat capacity of the body constrains the rate of temperature change, slowing it down and thereby making the problem of temperature regulation tractable for the organism's control systems. Without it, even minor heat loads would cause immediate and potentially lethal temperature spikes.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{245}\n$$", "id": "2579620"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond internal heat storage, we now examine how organisms exchange heat with their surroundings, a process dominated by convection in many scenarios.
