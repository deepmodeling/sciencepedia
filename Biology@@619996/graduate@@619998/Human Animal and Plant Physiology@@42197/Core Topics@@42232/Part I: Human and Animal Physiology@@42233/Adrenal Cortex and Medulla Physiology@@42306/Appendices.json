It is based on fundamental principles of chemical equilibrium and mass conservation and contains all necessary information to derive a unique, meaningful solution. We proceed.\n\nThe system describes the equilibrium binding of a ligand, cortisol ($C$), to two independent classes of binding sites, Corticosteroid-Binding Globulin (CBG) and Albumin (Alb). We are tasked with determining the concentration of free cortisol, which we denote as $F$. The analysis will begin from the stipulated first principles.\n\nLet $F$ be the molar concentration of free cortisol.\nLet $C_{\\mathrm{CBG}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{Alb}}$ be the concentrations of cortisol bound to CBG and Albumin, respectively.\nLet $P_{\\mathrm{CBG}}$ and $P_{\\mathrm{Alb}}$ be the concentrations of free (unbound) binding sites on CBG and Albumin, respectively.\nThe given total concentrations are $C_T$ for cortisol, $P_{\\mathrm{CBG},T}$ for CBG binding sites, and $P_{\\mathrm{Alb},T}$ for Albumin binding sites.\nThe equilibrium dissociation constants are $K_{d,\\mathrm{CBG}}$ and $K_{d,\\mathrm{Alb}}$.\n\nThe governing equations are derived from the law of mass action and the principle of mass conservation.\n\n$1$. Law of Mass Action:\nFor the reversible binding reaction $C + P_{\\mathrm{CBG}} \\rightleftharpoons C_{\\mathrm{CBG}}$, the dissociation equilibrium is:\n$$K_{d,\\mathrm{CBG}} = \\frac{F \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{CBG}}}{C_{\\mathrm{CBG}}}$$\nFor the reaction $C + P_{\\mathrm{Alb}} \\rightleftharpoons C_{\\mathrm{Alb}}$, the dissociation equilibrium is:\n$$K_{d,\\mathrm{Alb}} = \\frac{F \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{Alb}}}{C_{\\mathrm{Alb}}}$$\n\n$2$. Conservation of Mass:\nThe total concentration of cortisol is the sum of its free and bound forms:\n$$C_T = F + C_{\\mathrm{CBG}} + C_{\\mathrm{Alb}}$$\nThe total concentration of binding sites for each protein is the sum of free and occupied sites:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{CBG},T} = P_{\\mathrm{CBG}} + C_{\\mathrm{CBG}}$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{Alb},T} = P_{\\mathrm{Alb}} + C_{\\mathrm{Alb}}$$\n\nFrom these five equations, we must derive a single equation for the unknown $F$. First, we express the bound cortisol concentrations, $C_{\\mathrm{CBG}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{Alb}}$, as functions of $F$ and the total protein concentrations.\n\nFrom the conservation of CBG sites, $P_{\\mathrm{CBG}} = P_{\\mathrm{CBG},T} - C_{\\mathrm{CBG}}$. Substituting this into the mass action equation for CBG:\n$K_{d,\\mathrm{CBG}} = \\frac{F \\cdot (P_{\\mathrm{CBG},T} - C_{\\mathrm{CBG}})}{C_{\\mathrm{CBG}}}$.\nRearranging for $C_{\\mathrm{CBG}}$ yields:\n$C_{\\mathrm{CBG}} \\cdot K_{d,\\mathrm{CBG}} = F \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{CBG},T} - F \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{CBG}}$\n$C_{\\mathrm{CBG}} (K_{d,\\mathrm{CBG}} + F) = F \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{CBG},T}$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{CBG}} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{CBG},T} \\cdot F}{K_{d,\\mathrm{CBG}} + F}$$\nBy an identical derivation for Albumin:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{Alb}} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{Alb},T} \\cdot F}{K_{d,\\mathrm{Alb}} + F}$$\nThese are the standard Langmuir binding isotherms for each protein.

The free cortisol concentration $F$ is typically governed by the high-affinity binder (CBG) and is expected to be in the same order of magnitude as $K_{d,\\mathrm{CBG}}$. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that $F \\ll K_{d,\\mathrm{Alb}}$.\nSpecifically, we expect $F \\approx K_{d,\\mathrm{CBG}} = 30\\,\\mathrm{nmol\\,L^{-1}}$, while $K_{d,\\mathrm{Alb}} = 300{,}000\\,\\mathrm{nmol\\,L^{-1}}$.

Let $C(t)$ represent the plasma concentration of epinephrine at time $t$. The total amount of epinephrine in the plasma volume $V$ is the product $V C(t)$. The rate of change of this amount is given by the difference between the rate of input and the rate of removal.\n\nThe mass balance equation is thus:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}(V C) = \\text{Rate}_{\\text{in}} - \\text{Rate}_{\\text{out}} $$\nSince the volume $V$ is constant, this simplifies to:\n$$ V \\frac{dC}{dt} = \\text{Rate}_{\\text{in}} - \\text{Rate}_{\\text{out}} $$\n\nThe rate of input is the constant adrenal secretion rate, $S$.\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{\\text{in}} = S $$\n\nThe rate of removal is the sum of the two specified processes:\n1.

This deficient constant is $25\\%$ of the wild-type value, $k_{c}^{\\text{WT}}$.\n$$k_{c}^{\\text{def}} = 0.25 \\times k_{c}^{\\text{WT}}$$\nSubstituting the given value for $k_{c}^{\\text{WT}}$:\n$$k_{c}^{\\text{def}} = 0.25 \\times 0.90 \\text{ min}^{-1} = 0.225 \\text{ min}^{-1}$$\n\nA critical condition of the model is the negative feedback loop, which adjusts upstream production to maintain the cortisol flux, $v_{c}$, at a constant target value, $T$. This holds true even in the deficient state. Therefore:\n$$v_{c}^{\\text{def}} = T$$\nThe flux $v_{c}^{\\text{def}}$ is also defined by the first-order kinetic equation using the deficient rate constant and the new steady-state substrate concentration:\n$$v_{c}^{\\text{def}} = k_{c}^{\\text{def}}S^{\\text{def}}$$\nBy equating the two expressions for $v_{c}^{\\text{def}}$, we have:\n$$k_{c}^{\\text{def}}S^{\\text{def}} = T$$\nThis equation allows us to solve for the unknown steady-state concentration, $S^{\\text{def}}$:\n$$S^{\\text{def}} = \\frac{T}{k_{c}^{\\text{def}}}$$\nThis result shows that to compensate for a lower enzyme efficiency ($k_{c}^{\\text{def}}$), the system must increase the concentration of the precursor substrate ($S^{\\text{def}}$) to maintain the required product output ($T$).\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for $S^{\\text{def}}$ back into the equation for the androgen flux, $v_{a}$:\n$$v_{a} = k_{a}S^{\\text{def}} = k_{a}\\left(\\frac{T}{k_{c}^{\\text{def}}}\\right)$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the androgen flux in the deficient state.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values:\n- $k_{a} = 0.10 \\text{ min}^{-1}$\n- $T = 8.00 \\text{ nmol/min}$\n- $k_{c}^{\\text{def}} = 0.225 \\text{ min}^{-1}$\n\n$$v_{a} = (0.10 \\text{ min}^{-1}) \\times \\frac{8.00 \\text{ nmol/min}}{0.225 \\text{ min}^{-1}}$$\n$$v_{a} = \\frac{0.10 \\times 8.00}{0.225} \\text{ nmol/min}$$\n$$v_{a} = \\frac{0.800}{0.225} \\text{ nmol/min}$$\n$$v_{a} \\approx 3.555... \\text{ nmol/min}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The fourth significant figure is $5$, so we round up the third digit.\n$$v_{a} \\approx 3.56 \\text{ nmol/min}$$\nThis increased flux to the androgen pathway is the characteristic biochemical finding in CAH.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.56}$$", "id": "2547225"}]}
