It is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It presents a standard, solvable problem in the field of respiratory mechanics. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the mechanics of a passively ventilated respiratory system is the equation of motion, which relates the pressure applied at the airway opening, $P_{\\text{aw}}$, to the pressures required to overcome elastic and resistive forces. For a linear system, this is expressed as:\n$$\nP_{\\text{aw}}(t) = P_{\\text{el}}(t) + P_{\\text{res}}(t)\n$$\nwhere $P_{\\text{el}}(t)$ is the elastic pressure and $P_{\\text{res}}(t)$ is the resistive pressure.\n\nThe elastic pressure depends on the volume of gas delivered into the lungs, $V(t)$, relative to the baseline volume at Functional Residual Capacity (FRC). The change in elastic pressure is inversely proportional to the static compliance of the respiratory system, $C_{\\text{rs}}$.
