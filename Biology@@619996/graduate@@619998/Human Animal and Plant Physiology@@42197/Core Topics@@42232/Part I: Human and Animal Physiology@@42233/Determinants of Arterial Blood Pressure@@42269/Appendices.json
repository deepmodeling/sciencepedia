In such a steady, incompressible, closed-loop setting, the time-averaged volumetric flow must be set by the time-averaged pressure gradient across the loop and the lumped resistance. Consider a patient whose cardiac output (CO), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and central venous pressure (CVP) are measured as follows: $CO = 5.0$ liters per minute, $SVR = 18$ millimeters of mercury times minutes per liter, and $CVP = 2$ millimeters of mercury. Using only first principles relating flow, pressure differences, and resistance in a closed hydraulic loop, determine the mean arterial pressure (MAP) consistent with these measurements. Then, quantify the relative error incurred if one neglects $CVP$ in this calculation. Report the mean arterial pressure in millimeters of mercury and the relative error as a pure decimal (no percent sign). Round both quantities to $3$ significant figures.

The model is an elementary application of fluid dynamics principles, analogous to a simple direct-current electrical circuit.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing steady, incompressible flow through a resistive element is that the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, is directly proportional to the pressure drop, $\\Delta P$, across the element and inversely proportional to the resistance, $R$. This is expressed as:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R}$$\nor, rearranged, as:\n$$\\Delta P = Q \\times R$$\nIn the context of the systemic circulation, the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, is the Cardiac Output, denoted as $CO$. The total resistance of the systemic circuit is the Systemic Vascular Resistance, $SVR$. The pressure drop, $\\Delta P$, is the difference between the mean pressure at the inlet of the systemic circuit, which is the Mean Arterial Pressure ($MAP$), and the mean pressure at the outlet, which is the Central Venous Pressure ($CVP$).\n\nThus, the governing equation for this system is:\n$$MAP - CVP = CO \\times SVR$$\nThis is the first principle from which we must work.

If $CVP$ is neglected, it is effectively set to zero ($CVP = 0$). Let us denote the mean arterial pressure calculated under this approximation as $MAP_{approx}$. The governing equation becomes:\n$$MAP_{approx} - 0 = CO \\times SVR$$\n$$MAP_{approx} = CO \\times SVR$$\nUsing the given values, we find:\n$$MAP_{approx} = 5.0 \\, \\frac{\\text{L}}{\\text{min}} \\times 18 \\, \\frac{\\text{mmHg} \\cdot \\text{min}}{\\text{L}} = 90 \\, \\text{mmHg}$$\nThe relative error, $\\epsilon_{r}$, is defined as the magnitude of the difference between the approximate value and the true value, divided by the true value:\n$$\\epsilon_{r} = \\frac{|MAP_{approx} - MAP|}{|MAP|}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for $MAP$ and $MAP_{approx}$:\n$$\\epsilon_{r} = \\frac{|90 \\, \\text{mmHg} - 92 \\, \\text{mmHg}|}{|92 \\, \\text{mmHg}|} = \\frac{|-2 \\, \\text{mmHg}|}{92 \\, \\text{mmHg}} = \\frac{2}{92}$$\nSimplifying the fraction gives:\n$$\\epsilon_{r} = \\frac{1}{46}$$\nTo express this as a decimal, we perform the division:\n$$\\epsilon_{r} \\approx 0.02173913...$$\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.

This equilibrium point is defined by the values of Cardiac Output ($CO$) and Right Atrial Pressure ($RAP$) that simultaneously satisfy the mechanics of venous return and the performance of the heart as a pump. The analysis must be grounded in the principles specified: conservation of mass and the hydrodynamic analog of Ohm's law.\n\nFirst, we formalize the relationship for venous return ($VR$). Venous return is the flow of blood from the systemic circulation back to the right atrium. According to the hydrodynamic analog of Ohm's law, flow is equal to the pressure gradient divided by the resistance. The driving pressure for venous return is the difference between the Mean Systemic Filling Pressure ($P_{msf}$), which represents the mean pressure in the systemic circulation if the heart were stopped, and the Right Atrial Pressure ($RAP$), which is the pressure at the inlet of the heart. The resistance to this flow is the lumped venous resistance, $R_v$. Therefore, the equation for venous return is:\n$$VR = \\frac{P_{msf} - RAP}{R_v}$$\n\nSecond, we apply the principle of conservation of mass for a closed-loop system at steady state. This principle dictates that the rate at which the heart pumps blood into the systemic circulation ($CO$) must be equal to the rate at which blood returns to the heart ($VR$). Thus, we have the condition:\n$$CO = VR$$\n\nBy combining these two principles, we derive the equation for the venous return curve, which expresses cardiac output as a function of right atrial pressure based on the properties of the vasculature:\n$$CO = \\frac{P_{msf} - RAP}{R_v}$$\n\nThe problem also provides an explicit equation for the cardiac function curve, which describes the heart's pumping performance as a function of its filling pressure, $RAP$. This is a linear representation of the Frank-Starling mechanism:\n$$CO = 7 - 0.5 \\cdot RAP$$\n\nThe equilibrium state of the system is the point ($CO$, $RAP$) where both the circulatory system's requirements and the heart's pumping ability are met. This corresponds to the intersection of the venous return curve and the cardiac function curve. To find this intersection, we set the two expressions for $CO$ equal to each other:\n$$\\frac{P_{msf} - RAP}{R_v} = 7 - 0.5 \\cdot RAP$$\n\nWe are given the following values: $P_{msf} = 12$ mmHg and $R_v = 1.5$ mmHg·min/L. Substituting these into the equation:\n$$\\frac{12 - RAP}{1.5} = 7 - 0.5 \\cdot RAP$$\n\nWe now solve this linear equation for the unknown variable, $RAP$. First, we multiply both sides by $1.5$ to clear the denominator:\n$$12 - RAP = 1.5 \\cdot (7 - 0.5 \\cdot RAP)$$\n$$12 - RAP = (1.5 \\cdot 7) - (1.5 \\cdot 0.5) \\cdot RAP$$\n$$12 - RAP = 10.5 - 0.75 \\cdot RAP$$\n\nNext, we rearrange the equation to isolate the terms containing $RAP$:\n$$12 - 10.5 = RAP - 0.75 \\cdot RAP$$\n$$1.5 = (1 - 0.75) \\cdot RAP$$\n$$1.5 = 0.25 \\cdot RAP$$\n\nSolving for $RAP$:\n$$RAP = \\frac{1.5}{0.25} = 6$$\nThe equilibrium Right Atrial Pressure is $6$ mmHg.\n\nNow, we can determine the corresponding equilibrium Cardiac Output by substituting this value of $RAP$ back into either of the initial equations for $CO$.
