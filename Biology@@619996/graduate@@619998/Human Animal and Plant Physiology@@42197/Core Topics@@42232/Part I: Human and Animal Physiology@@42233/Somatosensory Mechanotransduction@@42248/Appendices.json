Following the potential update in the non-refractory case, a spike condition is checked. If $V'_{n+1} \\ge V_{\\mathrm{th}}$:\n- A spike is registered, and the total spike count is incremented.\n- The membrane potential for the next step is set to the reset value: $V_{n+1} = V_{\\mathrm{reset}}$.\n- The refractory state is initiated by setting `ref_counter` to the total number of refractory steps, calculated as $\\lceil \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}} / \\Delta t \\rceil$.\n- If no spike occurs ($V'_{n+1} < V_{\\mathrm{th}}$), the potential for the next step is simply the integrated value: $V_{n+1} = V'_{n+1}$.\n\nThis numerical procedure is executed over the total simulation time $T_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ for each specified force amplitude $F_{\\mathrm{amp}}$. The resulting spike counts are collected and reported in the specified list format.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef run_simulation(F_amp, params):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates a single LIF neuron with a mechanotransduction current.\n\n    Args:\n        F_amp (float): The amplitude of the force stimulus in Newtons.\n        params (dict): A dictionary of model and simulation parameters in SI units.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The total number of spikes generated during the simulation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Unpack parameters from the dictionary\n    Cm = params[\"Cm\"]\n    gL = params[\"gL\"]\n    EL = params[\"EL\"]\n    Vth = params[\"Vth\"]\n    Vreset = params[\"Vreset\"]\n    tau_ref = params[\"tau_ref\"]\n    Erev = params[\"Erev\"]\n    gmax = params[\"gmax\"]\n    tau_x = params[\"tau_x\"]\n    F50 = params[\"F50\"]\n    kF = params[\"kF\"]\n    Tramp = params[\"Tramp\"]\n    Thold = params[\"Thold\"]\n    Ttot = params[\"Ttot\"]\n    dt = params[\"dt\"]\n\n    # Simulation setup\n    num_steps = int(Ttot / dt)\n    ref_steps = int(np.ceil(tau_ref / dt))\n    \n    # Initial conditions\n    v = EL\n    f_0 = 0.0\n    x_inf_0 = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-(f_0 - F50) / kF))\n    x = x_inf_0\n    \n    spike_count = 0\n    ref_counter = 0\n\n    # Main simulation loop\n    for i in range(num_steps):\n        t = i * dt\n        \n        # Calculate force F(t) based on the ramp-and-hold profile\n        if t < Tramp:\n            force = F_amp * t / Tramp\n        elif t < Tramp + Thold:\n            force = F_amp\n        else:\n            force = 0.0\n            \n        # Store x from the beginning of the step for the voltage update\n        x_now = x\n        \n        # Update gating variable x (this dynamic is always active)\n        x_inf = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-(force - F50) / kF))\n        x = x + (dt / tau_x) * (x_inf - x)\n        \n        # Update membrane potential v, conditional on refractory period\n        if ref_counter > 0:\n            # Neuron is in refractory period: clamp voltage and decrement counter\n            v = Vreset\n            ref_counter -= 1\n        else:\n            # Neuron is not refractory: integrate the membrane potential\n            i_leak = -gL * (v - EL)\n            i_mech = gmax * x_now * (Erev - v)\n            v = v + (dt / Cm) * (i_leak + i_mech)\n            \n            # Check for a spike\n            if v >= Vth:\n                spike_count += 1\n                v = Vreset          # Reset potential\n                ref_counter = ref_steps # Start refractory period\n                \n    return spike_count\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to define parameters, run simulations for all test cases,\n    and print the results in the specified format.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters are defined in base SI units (F, S, V, N, s)\n    params = {\n        \"Cm\": 100e-12,       # Capacitance (F)\n        \"gL\": 10e-9,         # Leak conductance (S)\n        \"EL\": -70e-3,        # Leak reversal potential (V)\n        \"Vth\": -50e-3,       # Spike threshold (V)\n        \"Vreset\": -65e-3,    # Reset potential (V)\n        \"tau_ref\": 3e-3,     # Absolute refractory period (s)\n        \"Erev\": 0.0,         # Mechanotransduction reversal potential (V)\n        \"gmax\": 30e-9,       # Maximal mechanotransduction conductance (S)\n        \"tau_x\": 5e-3,       # Activation time constant (s)\n        \"F50\": 5e-3,         # Half-activation force (N)\n        \"kF\": 1e-3,          # Force steepness (N)\n        \"Tramp\": 50e-3,      # Ramp duration (s)\n        \"Thold\": 150e-3,     # Hold duration (s)\n        \"Ttot\": 300e-3,      # Total simulation time (s)\n        \"dt\": 0.1e-3,        # Time step (s)\n    }\n    \n    # Test cases for force amplitudes (F_amp) in Newtons\n    test_cases = [0.0, 0.0030, 0.0032, 0.0050, 0.0100]\n    \n    results = []\n    for f_amp in test_cases:\n        count = run_simulation(f_amp, params)\n        results.append(count)\n\n    # Print the final result in the exact required format\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2608981"}]}
