Consider a periodic stimulus train of frequency $f$ so that the interspike interval is $\\Delta t = 1/f$. Assume the following fundamental and widely accepted biophysical principles:\n- Quantal release: at each stimulus, the expected number of vesicles released equals $p$ times the number of readily releasable vesicles available immediately before the stimulus.\n- First-order recovery: between stimuli, the number of readily releasable vesicles $R(t)$ relaxes toward $N$ with a first-order time constant $\\tau_{rec}$, governed by $\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\frac{N - R}{\\tau_{rec}}$.\n- Instantaneous depletion at the moment of stimulation: immediately after a stimulus, $R$ is reduced by the expected released amount and then recovers according to first-order kinetics until the next stimulus.\n\nStarting only from these assumptions, derive a closed-form expression for the steady-state expected number of vesicles released per stimulus during an infinitely long train in terms of $N$, $p$, $\\tau_{rec}$, and $f$.

We shall proceed with its formal derivation.\n\nLet $R_k$ be the expected number of vesicles in the readily releasable pool immediately before the $k$-th stimulus in a periodic train. The inter-stimulus interval is $\\Delta t = \\frac{1}{f}$. The dynamic process for each interval consists of two phases: instantaneous release and subsequent recovery.\n\nFirst, at the moment of the $k$-th stimulus, a fraction $p$ of the available vesicles are released. The expected number of released vesicles, which we denote as $V_k$, is given by the principle of quantal release:\n$$V_k = p R_k$$\nImmediately after this release, the number of vesicles in the pool is depleted. Let $R'_k$ be the number of vesicles remaining right after the $k$-th stimulus.\n$$R'_k = R_k - V_k = R_k - p R_k = (1-p)R_k$$\n\nSecond, during the time interval $\\Delta t$ between the $k$-th and the $(k+1)$-th stimulus, the vesicle pool recovers. The number of vesicles in the pool, $R(t)$, follows the first-order recovery dynamics:\n$$\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\frac{N - R(t)}{\\tau_{rec}}$$\nThis is a linear first-order ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separation of variables or by using an integrating factor. Let's rearrange the equation:\n$$\\frac{dR}{N - R} = \\frac{dt}{\\tau_{rec}}$$\nIntegrating both sides gives:\n$$-\\ln|N - R| = \\frac{t}{\\tau_{rec}} + C$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. We can write this as:\n$$N - R(t) = C' \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{rec}}\\right)$$\nwhere $C' = \\exp(-C)$. The initial condition for this recovery phase is the number of vesicles immediately after the preceding stimulus, i.e., $R(0) = R'_k$. Applying this condition at $t=0$:\n$$N - R(0) = N - R'_k = C'$$\nSo, the solution for the recovery phase is:\n$$R(t) = N - (N - R'_k) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{rec}}\\right)$$\nThe number of vesicles just before the next stimulus, $R_{k+1}$, is found by evaluating $R(t)$ at $t=\\Delta t$:\n$$R_{k+1} = R(\\Delta t) = N - (N - R'_k) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{rec}}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we combine the depletion and recovery steps into a single recurrence relation for $R_k$. Substitute $R'_k = (1-p)R_k$ into the equation for $R_{k+1}$:\n$$R_{k+1} = N - (N - (1-p)R_k) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{rec}}\\right)$$\n$$R_{k+1} = N - N\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{rec}}\\right) + (1-p)R_k \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{rec}}\\right)$$\n$$R_{k+1} = N\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{rec}}\\right)\\right) + R_k (1-p)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{rec}}\\right)$$\n\nThe problem asks for the steady-state condition during an infinitely long train.

This system must be solved numerically. As stipulated, we employ the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method with a fixed time step $\\Delta t$.\n\nLet the state of the system be represented by the vector $\\vec{z}(t) = [X(t), Y(t)]^T$. The system of ODEs can be written as $\\frac{d\\vec{z}}{dt} = \\vec{F}(t, \\vec{z})$, where $\\vec{F}$ is the vector of rate functions:\n$$ \\vec{F}(t, \\vec{z}) = \\begin{pmatrix} R(t) - \\frac{V_{\\max} X}{K_m+X} - k_{\\text{esc,ATP}}X \\\\ \\frac{V_{\\max} X}{K_m+X} - k_{\\text{esc,Ado}}Y \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe RK4 algorithm advances the solution from time $t_n$ to $t_{n+1} = t_n + \\Delta t$ using the following update rule:\n$$ \\vec{z}_{n+1} = \\vec{z}_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{6}(\\vec{k}_1 + 2\\vec{k}_2 + 2\\vec{k}_3 + \\vec{k}_4) $$\nwhere the intermediate slopes are:\n- $\\vec{k}_1 = \\vec{F}(t_n, \\vec{z}_n)$\n- $\\vec{k}_2 = \\vec{F}(t_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}, \\vec{z}_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\vec{k}_1)$\n- $\\vec{k}_3 = \\vec{F}(t_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}, \\vec{z}_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\vec{k}_2)$\n- $\\vec{k}_4 = \\vec{F}(t_n + \\Delta t, \\vec{z}_n + \\Delta t\\vec{k}_3)$\n\nThe simulation is executed for each test case from $t=0$ to $t=T_{\\text{total}}$. Throughout the simulation, the value of $Y(t)$ is recorded at each time step. After the simulation is complete, the maximum value of the recorded $Y(t)$ trajectory is identified. This peak concentration, which is calculated in units of M (moles/liter), is then converted to micromolar ($\\mu$M) by multiplying by $10^6$ and is rounded to three decimal places as required.
