Do not include units in the final boxed answer.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of free water clearance, a fundamental concept in renal physiology. We begin from first principles.\n\nThe foundation of renal clearance is the principle of conservation of mass. For any substance $x$ that is not synthesized, metabolized, or accumulated by the kidney, the rate of its excretion in urine must equal the rate at which it is cleared from the plasma perfusing the kidneys. At steady state, this is expressed as:\n$$P_x \\cdot C_x = U_x \\cdot V$$\nwhere $P_x$ is the plasma concentration of substance $x$, $C_x$ is the renal clearance of $x$, $U_x$ is the urine concentration of $x$, and $V$ is the urine flow rate. From this, the clearance of substance $x$ is defined as the volume of plasma completely cleared of the substance per unit time:\n$$C_x = \\frac{U_x \\cdot V}{P_x}$$\n\nThis principle is extended to the total concentration of all solutes, or osmoles. The clearance of total osmoles is termed osmolar clearance, $C_{osm}$. It represents the hypothetical volume of plasma cleared of all solutes per unit time. We substitute the total osmolality of urine, $U_{osm}$, and plasma, $P_{osm}$, into the general clearance formula:\n$$C_{osm} = \\frac{U_{osm} \\cdot V}{P_{osm}}$$\nThis quantity, $C_{osm}$, represents the volume of urine that would be required to excrete the solute load if the urine were isotonic with plasma (i.e., if $U_{osm} = P_{osm}$).\n\nTotal urine flow, $V$, can be conceptualized as the sum of two components: the volume required to excrete the measured solutes isotonically ($C_{osm}$) and the volume of solute-free water that is excreted along with these solutes. This latter volume is the free water clearance, $C_{H_2O}$. The relationship is definitional:\n$$V = C_{osm} + C_{H_2O}$$\nTo find an expression for free water clearance, we rearrange this definition:\n$$C_{H_2O} = V - C_{osm}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{osm}$ yields the final formula for free water clearance in terms of measurable quantities:\n$$C_{H_2O} = V - \\frac{U_{osm} \\cdot V}{P_{osm}}$$\nThis expression can be conveniently factored as:\n$$C_{H_2O} = V \\left( 1 - \\frac{U_{osm}}{P_{osm}} \\right)$$\nThis is the required derivation.\n\nWe now proceed with the calculation using the provided data:\nPlasma osmolality, $P_{osm} = 289$ mOsm/kg $\\mathrm{H_2O}$\nUrine osmolality, $U_{osm} = 920$ mOsm/kg $\\mathrm{H_2O}$\nUrine flow rate, $V = 0.45$ mL/min\n\nFirst, we calculate the osmolar clearance, $C_{osm}$:\n$$C_{osm} = \\frac{(920 \\text{ mOsm/kg}) \\cdot (0.45 \\text{ mL/min})}{289 \\text{ mOsm/kg}} = \\frac{414}{289} \\text{ mL/min} \\approx 1.4325 \\text{ mL/min}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the free water clearance, $C_{H_2O}$, using its definition:\n$$C_{H_2O} = V - C_{osm} = 0.45 \\text{ mL/min} - 1.43252595... \\text{ mL/min}$$\n$$C_{H_2O} = -0.98252595... \\text{ mL/min}$$\n\nThe sign of the free water clearance indicates the net handling of solute-free water by the kidneys.\nA positive $C_{H_2O}$ means that $V > C_{osm}$, indicating that the urine is dilute relative to plasma ($U_{osm} < P_{osm}$) and excess free water is being excreted. This state is called diuresis.\nA negative $C_{H_2O}$ means that $V < C_{osm}$, indicating that the urine is concentrated relative to plasma ($U_{osm} > P_{osm}$) and free water has been reabsorbed from the filtrate back into the body. This state is called antidiuresis.\n\nIn this case, $C_{H_2O}$ is approximately $-0.9825$ mL/min. The negative sign confirms that the kidney is reabsorbing free water, thereby conserving it. This is the physiologically correct response to the state of water restriction described in the problem. The hormonal mediator for this water reabsorption is antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which is released in response to an increase in plasma osmolality. ADH increases water permeability in the collecting ducts, allowing water to move from the tubular lumen into the hypertonic renal medullary interstitium, resulting in the excretion of a small volume of concentrated urine. The calculated negative free water clearance is the quantitative measure of this process.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of free water clearance rounded to four significant figures.\n$C_{H_2O} \\approx -0.9825$ mL/min.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.9825}$$", "id": "2623180"}, {"introduction": "Clinical intuition can sometimes be misleading, especially in complex electrolyte disorders.
