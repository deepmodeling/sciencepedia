Empirically, the steady-state PTH secretion rate as a function of extracellular calcium can be modeled by an inhibitory Hill equation that captures receptor occupancy and cooperativity. Consider an inhibitory cooperative response function mapping extracellular calcium concentration $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ (in $\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}$) to PTH secretion rate $P$ (in $\\mathrm{pg}/\\mathrm{mL}$), with basal secretion $P_0$, maximal dynamic increment $\\Delta P$ above basal, a calcium set-scale $K$ (with units $\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}$), and Hill coefficient $n$ (dimensionless cooperativity). Assume that PTH decreases monotonically with increasing $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$.\n\nStarting from the fundamental basis that receptor-mediated responses at steady state can be approximated by Hill-type relations derived from mass-action occupancy with cooperativity, and that the set-point for PTH control is the calcium concentration at which PTH secretion lies at the midpoint of its dynamic range, formulate and fit a cooperative inhibitory Hill model to synthetic datasets, then extract two summary quantities for each dataset:\n- the calcium set-point (in $\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}$), defined as the value of $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ that yields the midpoint PTH level between basal and maximal secretion, and\n- the local slope of the PTH-versus-calcium curve (in $\\mathrm{pg}/\\mathrm{mL}$ per $\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}$) evaluated at the set-point.\n\nYour program must implement a nonlinear least-squares fit of a cooperative inhibitory Hill model with parameters $\\{P_0,\\Delta P,K,n\\}$ to the supplied datasets, subject to the biologically realistic constraints $P_0 \\ge 0$, $\\Delta P \\ge 0$, $K > 0$, and $n > 0$.

The task is to model the inhibitory effect of extracellular calcium, $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$, on the secretion of parathyroid hormone, $P$, using a specific form of the Hill equation. We must first validate the provided datasets by fitting this model, and then extract two critical parameters from the fitted model: the calcium set-point and the system's sensitivity (slope) at that set-point.\n\nThe governing equation for the PTH secretion rate is given as an inhibitory Hill function:\n$$P([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]) = P_0 + \\frac{\\Delta P}{1 + \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]}{K} \\right)^n}$$\nIn this equation, $P_0$ represents the basal or minimal PTH secretion rate observed at high calcium concentrations. $\\Delta P$ is the maximal dynamic range of secretion above this basal level, such that the maximal secretion rate, approached at zero calcium, is $P_{max} = P_0 + \\Delta P$. The parameter $K$ is the Hill constant, representing the calcium concentration at which the inhibitory effect is half-maximal. Finally, $n$ is the dimensionless Hill coefficient, which quantifies the cooperativity or steepness of the response.\n\nBefore proceeding to numerical implementation, we must derive from first principles the analytical expressions for the two quantities of interest.\n\n1.  **Derivation of the Calcium Set-Point**\n\nThe problem defines the calcium set-point, which we denote as $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{sp}$, as the concentration of calcium that results in a PTH secretion rate precisely at the midpoint of its dynamic range. The dynamic range extends from the minimum level $P_0$ to the maximum level $P_0 + \\Delta P$. The midpoint PTH level, $P_{mid}$, is therefore calculated as:\n$$P_{mid} = P_0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\left( (P_0 + \\Delta P) - P_0 \\right) = P_0 + \\frac{\\Delta P}{2}$$\nTo find the corresponding calcium concentration, we set the model equation equal to $P_{mid}$ and solve for $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{sp}$:\n$$P_0 + \\frac{\\Delta P}{1 + \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{sp}}{K} \\right)^n} = P_0 + \\frac{\\Delta P}{2}$$\nAssuming a non-zero dynamic range ($\\Delta P > 0$), we can simplify this expression. First, subtract $P_0$ from both sides:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta P}{1 + \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{sp}}{K} \\right)^n} = \\frac{\\Delta P}{2}$$\nNext, by taking the reciprocal of both sides (after dividing by $\\Delta P$):\n$$1 + \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{sp}}{K} \\right)^n = 2$$\n$$\\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{sp}}{K} \\right)^n = 1$$\nSince both $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{sp}$ and $K$ must be positive real numbers, the only valid solution is:\n$$\\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{sp}}{K} = 1 \\implies [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{sp} = K$$\nThis rigorous derivation demonstrates that the physiological set-point, as defined in the problem, is mathematically identical to the parameter $K$ of the Hill model. Therefore, to find the set-point, we must determine the value of $K$ through model fitting.\n\n2.  **Derivation of the Slope at the Set-Point**\n\nThe second quantity required is the local slope of the PTH response curve, evaluated at the calcium set-point. This is the first derivative of the function $P([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}])$ with respect to $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$, evaluated at $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}] = K$. Let us use the variable $x$ for $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$. The model is $P(x) = P_0 + \\Delta P \\left(1 + (x/K)^n\\right)^{-1}$.\nWe apply the chain rule to find the derivative $\\frac{dP}{dx}$:\n$$\\frac{dP}{dx} = 0 + \\Delta P \\cdot \\left( -1 \\cdot \\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{x}{K}\\right)^n\\right)^{-2} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\left(\\frac{x}{K}\\right)^n\\right)$$\nThe derivative of the inner term is $\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{x^n}{K^n}\\right) = \\frac{nx^{n-1}}{K^n}$. Substituting this back, we get:\n$$\\frac{dP}{dx} = -\\Delta P \\cdot \\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{x}{K}\\right)^n\\right)^{-2} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{nx^{n-1}}{K^n}\\right) = -\\frac{n \\Delta P x^{n-1}}{K^n \\left(1 + (x/K)^n\\right)^2}$$\nNow, we evaluate this expression at the set-point, $x = [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{sp} = K$:\n$$\\left.\\frac{dP}{dx}\\right|_{x=K} = -\\frac{n \\Delta P K^{n-1}}{K^n \\left(1 + (K/K)^n\\right)^2} = -\\frac{n \\Delta P K^{n-1}}{K^n \\left(1 + 1\\right)^2} = -\\frac{n \\Delta P K^{n-1}}{4K^n}$$\nUsing the property of exponents $K^{n-1}/K^n = K^{-1} = 1/K$, we obtain the final, concise formula for the slope at the set-point:\n$$\\text{Slope}_{sp} = -\\frac{n \\Delta P}{4K}$$\nThis result shows that the steepness of the curve at its central point is directly proportional to the dynamic range $\\Delta P$ and the cooperativity $n$, and inversely proportional to the set-point $K$.\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows. For each of the four specified cases, synthetic data for $P$ versus $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ are generated using the provided \"true\" parameters. Then, a nonlinear least-squares regression (`scipy.optimize.curve_fit`) is employed to fit our model function to this noiseless data, yielding estimates for the parameters $\\{P_0, \\Delta P, K, n\\}$. The constraints $P_0 \\ge 0$, $\\Delta P \\ge 0$, $K > 0$, and $n > 0$ are enforced using bounds in the fitting algorithm. Because the data are perfect, the fitted parameters are expected to match the true parameters with high precision. Finally, the derived analytical formulas are used with the fitted parameters to calculate the set-point ($K_{fit}$) and the slope at the set-point ($-\\frac{n_{fit} \\Delta P_{fit}}{4K_{fit}}$).

To solve this, we use a reference substance, creatinine ($Cr$), to estimate GFR. Creatinine is freely filtered and not significantly reabsorbed or secreted (this is a standard clinical approximation). Therefore, its renal clearance, $C_{Cr}$, provides a good estimate of $GFR$.\n\nThe renal clearance of any substance $x$, $C_x$, is given by:\n$$ C_x = \\frac{U_x \\times \\dot{V}}{P_x} $$\nFor creatinine, its clearance is:\n$$ C_{Cr} = \\frac{U_{Cr} \\times \\dot{V}}{P_{Cr}} $$\nWe make the approximation $GFR \\approx C_{Cr}$:\n$$ GFR \\approx \\frac{U_{Cr} \\times \\dot{V}}{P_{Cr}} $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $GFR$ into our equation for $FE_{Ca}$:\n$$ FE_{Ca} \\approx \\frac{U_{Ca} \\times \\dot{V}}{\\left( \\frac{U_{Cr} \\times \\dot{V}}{P_{Cr}} \\right) \\times P_{Ca^{2+}}} $$\nThe term for urine flow rate, $\\dot{V}$, appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it can be algebraically canceled.

Express your final numerical answer in $\\mathrm{mmol\\ L^{-1}}$ and round to three significant figures.", "solution": "Magnesium ions ($\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$) are essential cofactors in several steps that control parathyroid hormone (PTH) biology. First, secretory granule priming and vesicle fusion depend on adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is biologically active predominantly as the $\\mathrm{MgATP}^{2-}$ complex. Diminished $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ lowers the availability of $\\mathrm{MgATP}^{2-}$ and depresses ATP-dependent stages of exocytosis, thereby reducing PTH release even when hypocalcemia would otherwise stimulate secretion via decreased signaling through the calcium-sensing receptor. In addition, the generation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) by adenylyl cyclase requires $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ as an obligatory cofactor, and heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) signaling (including $G_{s}$ activation and guanosine triphosphate cycling) also requires $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$. At low $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, adenylyl cyclase activity falls in parathyroid cells and in target tissues such as kidney and bone. The net result is a dual defect: reduced PTH secretion and diminished PTH receptor (PTHR) signaling (functional PTH resistance), both of which frustrate the corrective endocrine response to hypocalcemia.\n\nTo estimate the minimal extracellular free magnesium concentration $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]$ that restores sufficient responsiveness, we use the given minimal model:\n- PTH secretion as a Hill function $S([\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}])=\\dfrac{[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]^{n_{s}}}{[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]^{n_{s}}+M_{s}^{\\,n_{s}}}$ with $M_{s}=0.50\\ \\mathrm{mmol\\ L^{-1}}$ and $n_{s}=3$.\n- PTHR signaling as Michaelisâ€“Menten $R([\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}])=\\dfrac{[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]}{[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]+K_{r}}$ with $K_{r}=0.35\\ \\mathrm{mmol\\ L^{-1}}$.\n\nBy requirement, hypocalcemia reversal needs $S([\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}])\\geq 0.5$ and $R([\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}])\\geq 0.6$ simultaneously.
