Assume that convective and radiative heat transfer at the outer fur surface and within the fur are negligible compared to conduction through the fur, and that the skin and ambient act as isothermal reservoirs.\n\nThe fur is a two-phase composite: keratin fibers (solid phase) with thermal conductivity $k_{k}$ that occupy a uniform cross-sectional area fraction equal to their bulk volume fraction $\\phi_{k}$, and pores that occupy fraction $1-\\phi_{k}$. In the dry state, pores are filled with air of conductivity $k_{\\text{air}}$; when thoroughly wetted, these pores are filled with liquid water of conductivity $k_{\\text{water}}$. The keratin fibers are assumed to form continuous columns across the thickness in parallel with the pore phase, so that heat can flow through both phases simultaneously across the same temperature drop.\n\nStarting only from Fourier’s law of heat conduction and conservation of energy under steady state, derive the effective thermal conductivity for this parallel-path composite in the dry and wetted states, and then use it to estimate the increase in steady-state conductive heat loss through the fur upon wetting (defined as the wetted minus dry heat loss).\n\nUse the following parameter values, which are representative and scientifically plausible:\n- $L = 0.020$ m,\n- $A = 0.050$ m$^{2}$,\n- $T_{s} = 35\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, $T_{a} = 5\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$,\n- $k_{k} = 0.20$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$,\n- $k_{\\text{air}} = 0.025$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$,\n- $k_{\\text{water}} = 0.60$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$,\n- $\\phi_{k} = 0.10$.\n\nExpress your final numerical answer as the increase in heat loss in watts (W), rounded to three significant figures.

For $T_{a} < T_{\\ell c}$ (Cold Stress):\n    The animal minimizes its thermal conductance to $C_{\\min}$ and increases its metabolic rate to maintain $T_{b}$. Using the simplified heat balance equation:\n    $$M_{\\text{pred}}(T_{a}) = C_{\\min}(T_{b} - T_{a})$$\n\nTo find the unknown parameter $C_{\\min}$, we enforce the continuity of the function $M_{\\text{pred}}(T_{a})$ at the lower critical temperature, $T_{\\ell c}$. The metabolic rate calculated from the cold-stress regime must match the metabolic rate in the TNZ at this point.\n$$\\lim_{T_{a} \\to T_{\\ell c}^{-}} M_{\\text{pred}}(T_{a}) = M_{\\text{pred}}(T_{\\ell c})$$\n$$C_{\\min}(T_{b} - T_{\\ell c}) = \\text{BMR}$$\nFrom this condition, we solve for $C_{\\min}$:\n$$C_{\\min} = \\frac{\\text{BMR}}{T_{b} - T_{\\ell c}}$$\nSubstituting this expression back into the equation for the cold-stress regime gives:\n$$M_{\\text{pred}}(T_{a}) = \\left(\\frac{\\text{BMR}}{T_{b} - T_{\\ell c}}\\right)(T_{b} - T_{a}) = \\text{BMR} \\frac{T_{b} - T_{a}}{T_{b} - T_{\\ell c}}$$\n\nCombining these three pieces yields the complete explicit piecewise expression for $M_{\\text{pred}}(T_{a})$:\n$$\nM_{\\text{pred}}(T_{a}) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\text{BMR} \\frac{T_{b} - T_{a}}{T_{b} - T_{\\ell c}} & \\text{if } T_{a} < T_{\\ell c} \\\\\n\\text{BMR} & \\text{if } T_{\\ell c} \\le T_{a} \\le T_{u c} \\\\\n\\text{BMR} + \\alpha(T_{a} - T_{u c}) & \\text{if } T_{a} > T_{u c}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nNow, we apply this model to the specific bird, using the given parameters:\n$T_{b} = 40\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, $\\text{BMR} = 0.35\\,\\mathrm{W}$, $T_{\\ell c} = 28\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, $T_{u c} = 35\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, and $\\alpha = 0.015\\,\\mathrm{W}/^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerical value of $C_{\\min}$:\n$$C_{\\min} = \\frac{0.35\\,\\mathrm{W}}{40\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} - 28\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}} = \\frac{0.35}{12}\\,\\mathrm{W}/^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} \\approx 0.02917\\,\\mathrm{W}/^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$$\nThe numerical model for this bird is:\n$$\nM_{\\text{pred}}(T_{a}) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{0.35}{12}(40 - T_{a}) & \\text{if } T_{a} < 28 \\\\\n0.35 & \\text{if } 28 \\le T_{a} \\le 35 \\\\\n0.35 + 0.015(T_{a} - 35) & \\text{if } T_{a} > 35\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nWe now compute the predicted metabolic rates, $M_{\\text{pred}}(T_{a,i})$, for the seven given ambient temperatures, $T_{a,i}$, and calculate the squared errors, $(M_{\\text{obs},i} - M_{\\text{pred}}(T_{a,i}))^{2}$.\n\n- For $T_{a,1} = 5\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ ($< 28$):\n$M_{\\text{pred}}(5) = \\frac{0.35}{12}(40 - 5) = \\frac{0.35 \\times 35}{12} = \\frac{12.25}{12} \\approx 1.02083\\,\\mathrm{W}$.\nError squared: $(1.05 - \\frac{12.25}{12})^{2} = (\\frac{12.6 - 12.25}{12})^{2} = (\\frac{0.35}{12})^{2} \\approx 0.00085069\\,\\mathrm{W}^{2}$.\n\n- For $T_{a,2} = 15\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ ($< 28$):\n$M_{\\text{pred}}(15) = \\frac{0.35}{12}(40 - 15) = \\frac{0.35 \\times 25}{12} = \\frac{8.75}{12} \\approx 0.72917\\,\\mathrm{W}$.\nError squared: $(0.70 - \\frac{8.75}{12})^{2} = (\\frac{8.4 - 8.75}{12})^{2} = (\\frac{-0.35}{12})^{2} \\approx 0.00085069\\,\\mathrm{W}^{2}$.\n\n- For $T_{a,3} = 28\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ ($\\in [28, 35]$):\n$M_{\\text{pred}}(28) = 0.35\\,\\mathrm{W}$.\nError squared: $(0.36 - 0.35)^{2} = (0.01)^{2} = 0.0001\\,\\mathrm{W}^{2}$.\n\n- For $T_{a,4} = 30\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ ($\\in [28, 35]$):\n$M_{\\text{pred}}(30) = 0.35\\,\\mathrm{W}$.\nError squared: $(0.34 - 0.35)^{2} = (-0.01)^{2} = 0.0001\\,\\mathrm{W}^{2}$.\n\n- For $T_{a,5} = 35\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ ($\\in [28, 35]$):\n$M_{\\text{pred}}(35) = 0.35\\,\\mathrm{W}$.\nError squared: $(0.37 - 0.35)^{2} = (0.02)^{2} = 0.0004\\,\\mathrm{W}^{2}$.\n\n- For $T_{a,6} = 37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ ($> 35$):\n$M_{\\text{pred}}(37) = 0.35 + 0.015(37 - 35) = 0.35 + 0.015(2) = 0.38\\,\\mathrm{W}$.\nError squared: $(0.40 - 0.38)^{2} = (0.02)^{2} = 0.0004\\,\\mathrm{W}^{2}$.\n\n- For $T_{a,7} = 40\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ ($> 35$):\n$M_{\\text{pred}}(40) = 0.35 + 0.015(40 - 35) = 0.35 + 0.015(5) = 0.425\\,\\mathrm{W}$.\nError squared: $(0.46 - 0.425)^{2} = (0.035)^{2} = 0.001225\\,\\mathrm{W}^{2}$.\n\nNow, we compute the Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) using its definition: $\\mathrm{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(M_{\\text{obs},i}-M_{\\text{pred}}(T_{a,i}))^{2}}$, with $n=7$.\nFirst, we sum the squared errors (SSE):\n$$ \\sum (M_{\\text{obs}} - M_{\\text{pred}})^{2} \\approx 0.00085069 + 0.00085069 + 0.0001 + 0.0001 + 0.0004 + 0.0004 + 0.001225 $$\n$$ \\text{SSE} \\approx 0.00392638\\,\\mathrm{W}^{2} $$\nNext, we calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE):\n$$ \\text{MSE} = \\frac{\\text{SSE}}{n} = \\frac{0.00392638}{7} \\approx 0.00056091\\,\\mathrm{W}^{2} $$\nFinally, we take the square root to find the RMSE:\n$$ \\text{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\text{MSE}} = \\sqrt{0.00056091} \\approx 0.02368359\\,\\mathrm{W} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ \\text{RMSE} \\approx 0.02368\\,\\mathrm{W} $$\nThis value quantifies the average deviation of the model's predictions from the observed metabolic rates.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.02368}\n$$", "id": "2619101"}]}
