To find the total time, $t$, required to travel a fixed path length, $L$, we must solve this differential equation. We rearrange the equation to separate variables:\n$$dt = \\frac{1}{v} dx$$\nNext, we integrate both sides. The time $t$ goes from $0$ to a final conduction time, which we will call $t_{cond}$, as the position $x$ goes from $0$ to the total path length $L$.\n$$\\int_{0}^{t_{cond}} dt' = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{1}{v} dx'$$\nSince the velocity $v$ is constant, it can be taken outside the integral on the right-hand side:\n$$[t']_{0}^{t_{cond}} = \\frac{1}{v} \\int_{0}^{L} dx'$$\n$$t_{cond} - 0 = \\frac{1}{v} [x']_{0}^{L}$$\n$$t_{cond} = \\frac{1}{v} (L - 0)$$\nThis yields the required expression for the conduction time over a fixed path length $L$ with a constant velocity $v$:\n$$t_{cond} = \\frac{L}{v}$$\nThis expression is the complete solution to the first part of the problem.

It presents a simplified but standard biophysical model of a neuron's membrane potential (the single-compartment model). The principles cited—Kirchhoff's current law for a capacitor-resistor circuit at steady state and Ohm's law for ionic currents—are fundamental to electrophysiology. The numerical values for conductances and potentials are physiologically realistic. The problem is well-posed, self-contained, and objective, providing all necessary information for a unique solution without ambiguity or contradiction. Initial conditions are consistent; with only the leak current, the steady-state equation $I_L = g_L(V - E_L) = 0$ yields $V = E_L$. The provided values $V_{\\mathrm{rest}} = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and $E_L = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ are consistent with this principle. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived from first principles as requested.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by applying the stated principles. At any steady-state condition, the net current across the membrane must be zero.\n$$ \\sum_{i} I_i = 0 $$\nInitially, the neuron is at rest, and only the leak conductance $g_L$ is present. The sole current is the leak current, $I_L$. The steady-state condition is:\n$$ I_L = g_L (V_{\\mathrm{rest}} - E_L) = 0 $$\nGiven that $g_L = 100\\,\\mathrm{nS} \\neq 0$, it must be that $V_{\\mathrm{rest}} = E_L$. The problem states $V_{\\mathrm{rest}} = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and $E_L = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, which is consistent.\n\nWhen the G protein–activated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels are opened, a new conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{GIRK}}$, is added to the system. Now, two currents flow across the membrane: the leak current $I_L$ and the GIRK current $I_{\\mathrm{GIRK}}$. The new steady-state membrane potential, which we denote as $V_{\\infty}$, is determined by the condition that the sum of these two currents is zero:\n$$ I_L + I_{\\mathrm{GIRK}} = 0 $$\nUsing the provided Ohm's law formulation for each current, we have:\n$$ g_L (V_{\\infty} - E_L) + g_{\\mathrm{GIRK}} (V_{\\infty} - E_K) = 0 $$\nThis equation provides the basis for understanding the resulting change in membrane potential. The potential $V_{\\infty}$ will be a value that balances the two opposing currents.\n\nTo address the first task—deriving from first principles why opening GIRK channels hyperpolarizes the membrane—we analyze the direction of the GIRK current at the initial resting potential. Just as the channels open, the membrane potential is still $V_{\\mathrm{rest}} = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. The driving force for potassium ions through the GIRK channels is $(V_{\\mathrm{rest}} - E_K)$. Since $V_{\\mathrm{rest}} = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and $E_K = -90\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, the driving force is $(-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}) - (-90\\,\\mathrm{mV}) = +25\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. The resulting current is $I_{\\mathrm{GIRK}} = g_{\\mathrm{GIRK}} (V_{\\mathrm{rest}} - E_K)$, which is positive. By convention, a positive current represents an outward flow of positive charge (efflux of $K^+$ ions). This loss of positive charge from the intracellular compartment makes the membrane potential more negative, a process defined as hyperpolarization. The membrane will continue to hyperpolarize until it reaches a new steady-state potential $V_{\\infty}$ where the outward GIRK current is exactly balanced by an inward leak current.\n\nThe second task is to obtain a general steady-state expression for the membrane potential. We rearrange the steady-state equation to solve for $V_{\\infty}$:\n$$ g_L V_{\\infty} - g_L E_L + g_{\\mathrm{GIRK}} V_{\\infty} - g_{\\mathrm{GIRK}} E_K = 0 $$\n$$ (g_L + g_{\\mathrm{GIRK}}) V_{\\infty} = g_L E_L + g_{\\mathrm{GIRK}} E_K $$\n$$ V_{\\infty} = \\frac{g_L E_L + g_{\\mathrm{GIRK}} E_K}{g_L + g_{\\mathrm{GIRK}}} $$\nThis is the general expression for the steady-state potential. It is a weighted average of the reversal potentials, where the conductances serve as the weights. The total conductance of the membrane is $g_{\\mathrm{total}} = g_L + g_{\\mathrm{GIRK}}$.\n\nThe third task is to compute the new steady-state membrane potential, $V_{\\infty}$. We substitute the given numerical values into the derived expression:\n- $g_L = 100\\,\\mathrm{nS}$\n- $E_L = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n- $g_{\\mathrm{GIRK}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nS}$\n- $E_K = -90\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n\n$$ V_{\\infty} = \\frac{(100\\,\\mathrm{nS})(-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}) + (10\\,\\mathrm{nS})(-90\\,\\mathrm{mV})}{100\\,\\mathrm{nS} + 10\\,\\mathrm{nS}} $$\nThe units of conductance ($\\mathrm{nS}$) cancel out, leaving the result in $\\mathrm{mV}$.\n$$ V_{\\infty} = \\frac{-6500 - 900}{110}\\,\\mathrm{mV} = \\frac{-7400}{110}\\,\\mathrm{mV} = -\\frac{740}{11}\\,\\mathrm{mV} $$\nAs a decimal, $V_{\\infty} \\approx -67.2727... \\,\\mathrm{mV}$. As predicted, this new potential is more negative than $V_{\\mathrm{rest}}$ but less negative than $E_K$.\n\nFinally, the fourth task is to calculate the steady-state voltage change, $\\Delta V = V_{\\infty} - V_{\\mathrm{rest}}$.\n$$ \\Delta V = \\left(-\\frac{740}{11}\\,\\mathrm{mV}\\right) - (-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}) $$\n$$ \\Delta V = -\\frac{740}{11} + 65 = -\\frac{740}{11} + \\frac{65 \\times 11}{11} = \\frac{-740 + 715}{11}\\,\\mathrm{mV} $$\n$$ \\Delta V = -\\frac{25}{11}\\,\\mathrm{mV} $$\nConverting this to a decimal value gives $\\Delta V \\approx -2.2727... \\,\\mathrm{mV}$.
