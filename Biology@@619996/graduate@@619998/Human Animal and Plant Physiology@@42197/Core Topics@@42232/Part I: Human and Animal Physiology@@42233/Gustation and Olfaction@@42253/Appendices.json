The provided parameters are physiologically plausible for a mammalian cell. The problem is self-contained and presents no logical contradictions or ambiguities. It requires a derivation from fundamental principles, which is a rigorous test of understanding. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation of the net sodium current, $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, begins from the definition of the electrochemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}_j$, for an ionic species $j$. This potential is the sum of its chemical potential and its electrical potential energy per mole.\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_j = \\mu_j^0 + RT \\ln(a_j) + z_j F V $$\nHere, $\\mu_j^0$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $a_j$ is the chemical activity of the ion, $z_j$ is its valence, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $V$ is the electric potential.\n\nAt thermodynamic equilibrium, there is no net flux of the ion across the membrane. This condition implies that the electrochemical potential of the ion is equal across the two compartments, the cytosol (in) and the mucosal solution (out). For sodium ions ($\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$), this is expressed as:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{Na, in}} = \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{Na, out}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for electrochemical potential:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{Na}}^0 + RT \\ln(a_{\\mathrm{Na, in}}) + z_{\\mathrm{Na}} F V_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{Na}}^0 + RT \\ln(a_{\\mathrm{Na, out}}) + z_{\\mathrm{Na}} F V_{\\mathrm{out}} $$\nThe standard potential $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Na}}^0$ cancels out.

This driving force produces a net current, $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, through the available conductive pathways.\n\nAccording to Ohm's law applied to ion channels, the macroscopic ionic current is the product of the macroscopic conductance, $G_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, and the electrochemical driving force.\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{Na}} = G_{\\mathrm{Na}} (V_m - E_{\\mathrm{Na}}) $$\nThe problem defines the macroscopic conductance as the product of the total number of channels, $N$, the probability that a single channel is open, $P_o$, and the conductance of a single open channel, $\\gamma$.\n$$ G_{\\mathrm{Na}} = N \\cdot P_o \\cdot \\gamma $$\nSubstituting this definition into the current equation gives the complete expression for the net sodium current:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{Na}} = N P_o \\gamma \\left( V_m - \\frac{RT}{z_{\\mathrm{Na}}F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{out}}}{[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{in}}}\\right) \\right) $$\nThis completes the required derivation.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested: derivation of the functional forms and then numerical evaluation.\n\nFirst, we justify the Hill equation form for the open probability, $P_o$, as a function of the ligand concentration, which we denote as $[L]$ for generality (here, $[L] = [\\mathrm{cAMP}]$). For cooperative binding where $n$ ligand molecules bind to a channel ($C$) to induce its open state ($C_{open}$), we can represent the overall reaction in a simplified, concerted manner at steady state:\n$$ nL + C_{closed} \\rightleftharpoons C_{open} $$\nApplying the law of mass action, the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$, for this reaction is:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[L]^n [C_{closed}]}{[C_{open}]} $$\nThe fraction of channels in the open state, $P_o$, is the ratio of the concentration of open channels to the total concentration of channels, $[C_{total}] = [C_{closed}] + [C_{open}]$.\n$$ P_o = \\frac{[C_{open}]}{[C_{total}]} = \\frac{[C_{open}]}{[C_{closed}] + [C_{open}]} $$\nFrom the expression for $K_d$, we can write $[C_{closed}]$ in terms of $[C_{open}]$:\n$$ [C_{closed}] = \\frac{K_d [C_{open}]}{[L]^n} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $P_o$:\n$$ P_o = \\frac{[C_{open}]}{\\frac{K_d [C_{open}]}{[L]^n} + [C_{open}]} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[L]^n} + 1} = \\frac{[L]^n}{K_d + [L]^n} $$\nThis is the Hill equation. The half-activation concentration, $K$, is defined as the ligand concentration at which the response is half-maximal, i.e., $P_o = 1/2$. Substituting $[L] = K$ into the derived expression, we have:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{K^n}{K_d + K^n} \\implies K_d + K^n = 2K^n \\implies K_d = K^n $$\nTherefore, the probability of a channel being in the open state can be written in terms of the Hill coefficient $n$, the half-activation concentration $K$, and the ligand concentration (in this case, $[\\mathrm{cAMP}]$):\n$$ P_o([\\mathrm{cAMP}]) = \\frac{[\\mathrm{cAMP}]^n}{K^n + [\\mathrm{cAMP}]^n} $$\nThis justifies the use of the specified functional form.\n\nSecond, we derive the expression for the macroscopic current, $I$. The problem states that the current follows the chord conductance relation, which is a form of Ohm's law. The total macroscopic conductance of the membrane patch, $G$, is the product of the maximum possible conductance, $g_{\\max}$ (when all channels are open, i.e., $P_o=1$), and the fraction of channels that are actually open, $P_o$.\n$$ G = g_{\\max} \\cdot P_o $$\nThe ionic current $I$ flowing through these channels is given by the product of the conductance $G$ and the electrochemical driving force. The driving force is the difference between the membrane potential, $V_m$, and the reversal potential for the ions carrying the current, $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$.\n$$ I = G(V_m - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}) $$\nBy convention in electrophysiology, an outward flow of positive charge is a positive current, and an inward flow of positive charge is a negative current. Substituting the expressions for $G$ and $P_o$ into the current equation, we obtain the complete expression for the steady-state macroscopic current:\n$$ I = g_{\\max} \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{cAMP}]^n}{K^n + [\\mathrm{cAMP}]^n} \\right) (V_m - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}) $$\n\nNow, we perform the numerical evaluation using the provided parameters.\nThe given values are:\n- $n = 2$\n- $K = 5 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $[\\mathrm{cAMP}] = 10 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $V_m = -65 \\ \\mathrm{mV} = -65 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{V}$\n- $E_{\\mathrm{rev}} = 0 \\ \\mathrm{mV} = 0 \\ \\mathrm{V}$\n- $g_{\\max} = 2.0 \\ \\mathrm{nS} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{S}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the open probability $P_o$:\n$$ P_o = \\frac{(10 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M})^2}{(5 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M})^2 + (10 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M})^2} = \\frac{100}{25 + 100} = \\frac{100}{125} = \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8 $$\nThe open probability is a dimensionless quantity, as expected.\n\nNext, we calculate the current $I$.

It is a standard, well-posed problem in quantitative pharmacology that is scientifically grounded and internally consistent. A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two stages.

Second, this $K_i$ value is used to predict the rightward shift (dose ratio, $r$) of the agonist concentration-response curve in the functional assay.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of the Inhibition Constant ($K_i$)**\n\nFor a competitive antagonist, the relationship between its half-maximal inhibitory concentration ($IC_{50}$) and its equilibrium inhibition constant ($K_i$) is described by the Cheng-Prusoff equation. This equation accounts for the presence of the labeled agonist (tracer) in the binding assay.\n\nThe Cheng-Prusoff equation is:\n$$K_i = \\frac{IC_{50}}{1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_d}}$$\nwhere $[A]$ is the concentration of the agonist tracer and $K_d$ is its equilibrium dissociation constant.\n\nThe given values are:\n- $IC_{50} = 500\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $[A] = 4.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $K_d = 8.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$K_i = \\frac{500\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{1 + \\frac{4.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{8.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}} = \\frac{500\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{1 + 0.5} = \\frac{500\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{1.5}$$\n$$K_i = \\frac{1000}{3}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nThis is the equilibrium dissociation constant for the competitive antagonist, probenecid.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the Dose Ratio ($r$)**\n\nThe problem describes a functional assay where the concentration-response curve for the agonist denatonium is measured in the absence and presence of the antagonist probenecid. For a purely competitive antagonist at equilibrium, the effect on the agonist's potency is quantified by the dose ratio, $r$. The value of $r$ depends on the concentration of the antagonist, $[I]$, and its affinity for the receptor, as described by its inhibition constant, $K_i$.\n\nThe relationship is given by the Gaddum-Schild equation:\n$$r = 1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}$$\nThis equation is directly applicable here due to the assumptions of pure competitive antagonism, equilibrium conditions, and negligible receptor reserve with $n_H = 1$, which together imply that the agonist's functional $EC_{50}$ is directly shifted by receptor competition. The inhibition constant $K_i$ determined from the binding assay is equivalent to the antagonist dissociation constant $K_B$ often used in the Schild analysis.\n\nThe given concentration of the antagonist is $[I] = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{mM}$. For consistency of units with $K_i$, this must be converted to $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$:\n$$[I] = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 1.00 \\times 1000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} = 1000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\n\nNow, substitute the values of $[I]$ and the previously calculated $K_i$ into the Gaddum-Schild equation:\n$$r = 1 + \\frac{1000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{\\frac{1000}{3}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}$$\nThe units of $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ cancel out, as expected for the dimensionless dose ratio:\n$$r = 1 + \\frac{1000 \\times 3}{1000} = 1 + 3 = 4$$\nThe calculated dose ratio is exactly $4$.
