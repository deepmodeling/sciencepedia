It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe task is to calculate the probability of an event derived from a sequence of $m$ independent trials. In each trial, a peptide-MHC complex is drawn uniformly at random with replacement from a pool of $N$ peptides. The pool is categorized into three disjoint sets: strong binders, moderate binders, and weak binders.\n\nLet us define the probabilities for a single random encounter:\n- The probability of encountering a strong binder, $p_s$, is the ratio of the number of strong binders to the total number of peptides:\n$$p_s = \\frac{n_s}{N}$$\n- The probability of encountering a moderate binder, $p_m$, is:\n$$p_m = \\frac{n_m}{N}$$\n- The probability of encountering a weak binder, $p_w$, is:\n$$p_w = \\frac{N - n_s - n_m}{N}$$\nThese three events are mutually exclusive and exhaustive for a single encounter, so $p_s + p_m + p_w = 1$.\n\nThe condition for the thymocyte to survive is that over the $m$ encounters, two conditions must be met simultaneously:\n1. Event $A$: No strong binders are encountered.\n2. Event $B$: At least one moderate binder is encountered.\n\nWe must compute the probability of the intersection of these two events, $P(A \\cap B)$.\nIt is often simpler to work with complementary events. Let us use the law of total probability, which states $P(A) = P(A \\cap B) + P(A \\cap B^c)$, where $B^c$ is the complement of event $B$. Rearranging gives:\n$$P(A \\cap B) = P(A) - P(A \\cap B^c)$$\n\nLet us analyze each term:\nEvent $A$ is \"no strong binders are encountered in $m$ trials\". This means that for each of the $m$ independent trials, the outcome must not be a strong binder. The probability of a single trial not being a strong binder is $1 - p_s = p_m + p_w = \\frac{N - n_s}{N}$. Since the trials are independent, the probability of this happening for all $m$ trials is:\n$$P(A) = \\left(1 - p_s\\right)^m = \\left(\\frac{N - n_s}{N}\\right)^m$$\n\nEvent $B^c$ is the complement of event $B$, meaning \"no moderate binders are encountered in $m$ trials\".\nThe event $A \\cap B^c$ is \"no strong binders are encountered in $m$ trials AND no moderate binders are encountered in $m$ trials\". This is equivalent to the event that all $m$ encounters must be with weak binders. The probability of encountering a weak binder in a single trial is $p_w$. As trials are independent, the probability of this occurring for all $m$ trials is:\n$$P(A \\cap B^c) = (p_w)^m = \\left(\\frac{N - n_s - n_m}{N}\\right)^m$$\n\nNow, we can substitute these results back into our expression for the desired probability, $P(\\text{survival}) = P(A \\cap B)$:\n$$P(\\text{survival}) = P(A) - P(A \\cap B^c) = \\left(\\frac{N - n_s}{N}\\right)^m - \\left(\\frac{N - n_s - n_m}{N}\\right)^m$$\n\nWe are given the numerical values: $N = 10000$, $n_s = 12$, $n_m = 180$, and $m = 300$.\nLet's substitute these values into the formula.\nFirst, calculate the bases of the exponents:\n- The base for the first term is $\\frac{N - n_s}{N} = \\frac{10000 - 12}{10000} = \\frac{9988}{10000} = 0.9988$.\n- The base for the second term is $\\frac{N - n_s - n_m}{N} = \\frac{10000 - 12 - 180}{10000} = \\frac{9808}{10000} = 0.9808$.\n\nThe probability is then:\n$$P(\\text{survival}) = (0.9988)^{300} - (0.9808)^{300}$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values of these terms.\n$(0.9988)^{300} \\approx 0.697529366$\n$(0.9808)^{300} \\approx 0.002981358$\n\nThe final probability is the difference between these two values:\n$$P(\\text{survival}) \\approx 0.697529366 - 0.002981358 = 0.694548008$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThe calculated probability is $0.694548008...$.

Let $N_n$ be the random variable for the number of cells in the clone at the end of cycle $n$. The initial population size, $N_0$, is a given constant.\n\nThe number of cells at cycle $n$, $N_n$, is the sum of the offspring from the $N_{n-1}$ cells present at the start of that cycle. Let $X_i$ be the random variable representing the number of daughter cells produced by the $i$-th cell during a single cycle. The probability distribution of $X_i$ is given as:\n$$\nP(X_i = 2) = p \\\\\nP(X_i = 0) = d \\\\\nP(X_i = 1) = 1 - p - d\n$$\nBecause the fates of all cells are independent, all $X_i$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).\n\nThe total population at cycle $n$ can be expressed as the sum of offspring from the population at cycle $n-1$:\n$$\nN_n = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{n-1}} X_i^{(n-1)}\n$$\nwhere $X_i^{(n-1)}$ denotes the number of offspring from cell $i$ existing at the beginning of cycle $n$.\n\nTo find the expected value $\\mathbb{E}[N_n]$, we use the law of total expectation (also known as the tower property):\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N_n] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[N_n | N_{n-1}]]\n$$\nFirst, we compute the inner conditional expectation, $\\mathbb{E}[N_n | N_{n-1}]$. Given that the clone size at cycle $n-1$ is $N_{n-1}$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N_n | N_{n-1}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{n-1}} X_i^{(n-1)} \\Big| N_{n-1}\\right]\n$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, and because $N_{n-1}$ is treated as a constant within the conditional expectation, this becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N_n | N_{n-1}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{n-1}} \\mathbb{E}[X_i^{(n-1)} | N_{n-1}]\n$$\nSince the outcome for each cell is independent of the total number of cells, $\\mathbb{E}[X_i^{(n-1)} | N_{n-1}] = \\mathbb{E}[X_i^{(n-1)}]$. Since all $X_i$ are identically distributed, let us define their common mean as $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mu = \\mathbb{E}[X_i]\n$$\nTherefore, the conditional expectation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N_n | N_{n-1}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{n-1}} \\mu = N_{n-1} \\mu\n$$\nNow, we calculate $\\mu$, the mean number of offspring per cell per cycle, from its definition:\n$$\n\\mu = (2 \\cdot P(X_i=2)) + (0 \\cdot P(X_i=0)) + (1 \\cdot P(X_i=1))\n$$\n$$\n\\mu = 2p + 0 \\cdot d + 1(1 - p - d) = 2p + 1 - p - d = 1 + p - d\n$$\nThis expression, $\\mu = 1 + p - d$, is the average multiplication factor for the cell population per cycle. The term $p-d$ represents the net effect of division versus apoptosis on the population count. If $p>d$, the clone tends to expand; if $p<d$, it tends to contract. This explicitly shows how the dependence on the difference $p-d$ emerges from the per-cell outcomes as requested.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[N_n | N_{n-1}]$ back into the law of total expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N_n] = \\mathbb{E}[N_{n-1} \\mu]\n$$\nSince $\\mu$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N_n] = \\mu \\mathbb{E}[N_{n-1}] = (1 + p - d) \\mathbb{E}[N_{n-1}]\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear recurrence relation for the expected clone size. We can solve it by iteration starting from $n=0$:\nThe base case is $\\mathbb{E}[N_0] = N_0$, since $N_0$ is a specified constant.\nFor $n=1$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N_1] = (1 + p - d) \\mathbb{E}[N_0] = N_0(1 + p - d)\n$$\nFor $n=2$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N_2] = (1 + p - d) \\mathbb{E}[N_1] = (1 + p - d) [N_0(1 + p - d)] = N_0(1 + p - d)^2\n$$\nBy induction, we can establish the general formula for any integer $n \\ge 0$.

All premises are factually correct and represent established scientific principles. The problem is well-posed, asking for a reasoned explanation and a prediction based on a hypothetical but mechanistically plausible experiment. The language is objective and technical. The provided principles are sufficient to construct a rigorous argument. The problem does not violate any criteria for validity; it is scientifically sound, objective, and internally consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed.\n\n**Derivation and Option Analysis**\n\nThe problem comprises two parts: $1$) explaining the physiological absence of somatic hypermutation (SHM) at T cell receptor (TCR) loci, and $2$) predicting the consequences of artificially inducing it.\n\nFirst, we address why SHM is restricted to B cells. The immune system is built upon a division of labor and a hierarchy of safety checks. T cells undergo a single, irreversible, and stringent selection process in the thymus. This central tolerance mechanism ensures that the mature T cell repertoire is self-tolerant and MHC-restricted. This selected repertoire is then considered \"fixed\" and provides a stable frame of reference for orchestrating the entire adaptive immune response. The physiological mechanism for this stability is the transcriptional silencing of the gene for Activation-Induced cytidine Deaminase (AID), *AICDA*, in T cells. While TCR genes are transcribed in a mature T cell (a prerequisite for AID activity, as per the givens), the enzyme itself is not produced.\n\nB cells, in contrast, are permitted to \"experiment\" with their receptor affinity in germinal centers (GCs) through SHM. This process is safe precisely because it is policed by the pre-vetted T follicular helper ($T_{\\text{FH}}$) cells. A B cell that, through SHM, acquires high affinity for a self-antigen will fail to receive activating signals from a cognate $T_{\\text{FH}}$ cell, because the T cell clone specific for that self-antigen would have been deleted during thymic negative selection. Without T cell help, the self-reactive B cell undergoes apoptosis. This constitutes a critical peripheral tolerance checkpoint that relies fundamentally on the fixed, non-mutating nature of the TCR.\n\nSecond, we predict the consequences if TCR loci were subjected to AID-mediated mutation in a GC, post-thymic selection.\n$1$. **Generation of Unchecked Specificities and Autoimmunity**: A mature T cell, having already passed central tolerance, would begin to accumulate mutations in its TCR genes. These mutations would alter the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), generating novel antigen specificities. Crucially, these new specificities have not been vetted by thymic negative selection. A random mutation could easily create a TCR with high affinity for a self-peptide-MHC complex abundant in the periphery. Upon encountering this self-antigen, the T cell would become activated, leading to an autoimmune attack on host tissues. The probability of autoimmunity, $p_{\\mathrm{auto}}$, would be a direct function of the mutation load, $\\mu$.\n$2$. **Breach of Foundational T Cell Properties**: Thymic selection establishes two core properties: MHC restriction and co-receptor lineage fidelity. SHM would jeopardize both.\n    - **MHC Restriction**: A mutation might abolish the TCR's ability to recognize self-MHC, rendering the T cell useless. More dangerously, it could alter it, allowing recognition of peptides in the context of foreign MHC (alloreactivity) or even independent of MHC, dismantling the central logic of antigen presentation.\n    - **Co-receptor Fidelity**: Thymic education aligns TCR specificity with co-receptor expression. A $\\mathrm{CD4}^{+}$ T cell recognizes MHC class II, and a $\\mathrm{CD8}^{+}$ T cell recognizes MHC class I. If SHM in a $\\mathrm{CD4}^{+}$ T cell generated a new specificity for an MHC class I-peptide complex, the interaction would be dysfunctional due to the mismatch of cell lineage ($CD4^{+}$) and the required co-receptor ($CD8$).\n$3$. **Genomic Instability and Lymphomagenesis**: AID is a potent DNA mutator with known off-target activity. Forcing its expression in T cells would not only mutate TCR loci but also risk introducing oncogenic mutations into other genes (e.g., proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressors), significantly increasing the probability of malignant transformation and T cell lymphoma.\n\nWith this framework, we evaluate the options.\n\n**A. SHM is absent at TCR loci because T cells lack variable regions and cannot tolerate any sequence diversity after recombination; if AID acted on TCRs in GCs, the main consequence would be loss of TCR association with the $\\mathrm{CD3}$ signaling complex, leading primarily to immunodeficiency without autoimmunity.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. The statement \"T cells lack variable regions\" is factually false. Both TCR $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ chains have variable regions generated by V(D)J recombination. While loss of function (e.g., failed association with the $CD3$ complex) is a possible outcome of mutation, the far more dangerous and likely consequence is a gain of harmful function, namely autoimmunity. This option misidentifies both the reason and the most critical consequence.\n\n**B. SHM is excluded from TCR loci because the TCR genes reside in constitutive heterochromatin that AID cannot access; forcing AID onto TCRs in GCs would mostly reduce autoimmunity by weakening TCR affinity for self-peptide–MHC complexes that escaped thymic deletion.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. For a T cell to express its TCR, the corresponding gene loci must be in an open, euchromatic state and actively transcribed. This condition makes them a potential substrate for AID, rather than preventing it. The physiological block is the absence of AID expression in T cells. The prediction that this would \"reduce autoimmunity\" is contrary to all logical reasoning. Random mutagenesis is overwhelmingly more likely to create new self-reactivities than to selectively eliminate pre-existing weak ones.\n\n**C. SHM does not occur in TCR genes because the immune system relies on thymic selection to fix TCR specificity and MHC restriction before export to the periphery; B cells can safely mutate receptors post-activation because they are gated by the need for cognate T cell help. If AID were to mutate TCR loci in GCs after thymic selection, new TCR specificities would arise without central tolerance checkpoints, increasing the probability $p_{\\mathrm{auto}}$ of self-reactivity with mutation load $\\mu$, risking breach of MHC restriction and co-receptor lineage fidelity (for example, altered MHC class recognition in $\\mathrm{CD4}^{+}$ versus $\\mathrm{CD8}^{+}$ T cells), heightening alloreactivity, and elevating lymphomagenesis due to off-target AID activity.**\nThis is **Correct**. This option provides a perfect and comprehensive answer. It correctly identifies the systems-level logic for the absence of TCR SHM: the requirement for a stable, centrally-tolerized T cell repertoire that acts as a gatekeeper for mutating B cells. Its prediction of consequences is exceptionally accurate and detailed, covering the generation of autoimmunity ($p_{\\mathrm{auto}}$ as a function of $\\mu$), the breach of MHC restriction and co-receptor lineage fidelity, heightened alloreactivity, and the risk of lymphomagenesis. This aligns perfectly with the derivation from first principles.\n\n**D. SHM is suppressed in TCR genes because T cells are short-lived, so post-selection diversification would be inefficient; if TCRs were mutated by AID in GCs, co-stimulation requirements would prevent activation of any self-reactive variants, yielding improved pathogen control without increased immunopathology.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. The premise \"T cells are short-lived\" is a false generalization; memory T cells are extremely long-lived. More importantly, the assertion that co-stimulation requirements would prevent autoimmunity is dangerously naive. Peripheral tolerance mechanisms are not absolute. During infection or inflammation, antigen-presenting cells are activated and express co-stimulatory molecules, providing the necessary \"signal $2$\". A newly-formed self-reactive T cell could easily be activated in such an environment. The prediction of \"improved pathogen control without increased immunopathology\" is speculative and completely ignores the catastrophic risk of autoimmunity.\n\n**E. SHM does not occur in TCR genes because AID requires immunoglobulin switch regions that are absent from TCR loci; if AID were redirected to TCRs in GCs, stringent GC selection would purge self-reactive T cells analogously to how it purges self-reactive B cells, thereby preserving tolerance while enhancing T cell affinity for antigen.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. The premise is wrong. AID's role in SHM targets the variable region exons, not the switch regions (which are for class-switch recombination). The prediction is based on a critically flawed analogy. The selection of B cells in the GC depends on receiving help from T cells. There is no equivalent \"helper cell\" to select the T cells themselves. The entire selection logic collapses if the selectors are themselves the subject of mutation. Therefore, there would be no mechanism to purge the newly arising self-reactive T cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2600039"}]}
