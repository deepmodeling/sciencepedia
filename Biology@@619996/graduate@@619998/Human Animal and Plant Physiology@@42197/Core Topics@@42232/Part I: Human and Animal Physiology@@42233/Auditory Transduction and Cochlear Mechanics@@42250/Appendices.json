The data are internally consistent (e.g., the temperature conversion from Celsius to Kelvin is correct) and physically realistic. It is objective and free of ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A rigorous solution will now be derived.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\nThe problem begins with the thermodynamic definition of the electrochemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}$, for an ionic species:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu} = \\mu^{0} + RT \\ln a + z F \\psi $$\nHere, $\\mu^{0}$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $a$ is the chemical activity of the ion, $z$ is the valence of the ion, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $\\psi$ is the local electric potential.\n\nWe must write this expression for the potassium ions ($K^{+}$) both inside the cell (intracellular space, subscript 'in') and outside the cell (extracellular space, subscript 'out'):\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\mu^{0} + RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{in}} + z F \\psi_{\\mathrm{in}} $$\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\mu^{0} + RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{out}} + z F \\psi_{\\mathrm{out}} $$\nNote that the standard chemical potential, $\\mu^{0}$, is identical in both compartments as it depends on the identity of the chemical species ($K^{+}$) and standard state conditions, not on the local environment.\n\nThe condition for equilibrium is that there is no net flux of the ion across the membrane. This occurs when the electrochemical potential is the same on both sides of the membrane:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{out}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and $\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{out}}$ gives:\n$$ \\mu^{0} + RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{in}} + z F \\psi_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\mu^{0} + RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{out}} + z F \\psi_{\\mathrm{out}} $$\nThe $\\mu^{0}$ term cancels from both sides:\n$$ RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{in}} + z F \\psi_{\\mathrm{in}} = RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{out}} + z F \\psi_{\\mathrm{out}} $$\nWe rearrange this equation to solve for the electric potential difference across the membrane, which is defined as $V \\equiv \\psi_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\psi_{\\mathrm{out}}$.

The role of OHCs in providing active feedback to reduce damping (cochlear amplification) is a well-established principle in auditory physiology.

The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe steady-state solution to the driven harmonic oscillator equation, $m \\ddot{x} + c \\dot{x} + k x = F_0 \\cos(\\omega t)$, is of the form $x(t) = A(\\omega) \\cos(\\omega t - \\phi)$, where the amplitude $A(\\omega)$ is given by:\n$$A(\\omega) = \\frac{F_0/m}{\\sqrt{(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + (c\\omega/m)^2}}$$\nUsing the definitions $\\omega_0^2 = k/m$ and $\\zeta = c/(2m\\omega_0)$, which implies $c/m = 2\\zeta\\omega_0$, the amplitude can be expressed in terms of the damping ratio $\\zeta$:\n$$A(\\omega) = \\frac{F_0/m}{\\sqrt{(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + (2\\zeta\\omega_0\\omega)^2}}$$\nThe problem specifies that the peak gain occurs at the natural frequency $\\omega = \\omega_0$. This is the condition of resonance. We evaluate the amplitude at this frequency, denoted $A_{\\mathrm{peak}} = A(\\omega_0)$:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{peak}} = A(\\omega_0) = \\frac{F_0/m}{\\sqrt{(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega_0^2)^2 + (2\\zeta\\omega_0\\omega_0)^2}} = \\frac{F_0/m}{\\sqrt{0 + (2\\zeta\\omega_0^2)^2}} = \\frac{F_0/m}{2\\zeta\\omega_0^2}$$\nThe problem states that $F_0$, $m$, and $k$ (and therefore $\\omega_0$) are constant between the active and passive states. Thus, the peak amplitude $A_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ is inversely proportional to the damping ratio $\\zeta$. This is the first required relationship:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{peak}} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\zeta}$$\nNext, we interpret the change in gain. A change in decibels ($\\mathrm{dB}$) is defined for an amplitude ratio $R$ as $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{dB}} = 20 \\log_{10}(R)$. The problem states a decrease of $20\\,\\mathrm{dB}$, so $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{dB}} = -20$. Let $A_{\\mathrm{act}}$ and $A_{\\mathrm{pass}}$ be the peak amplitudes in the active and passive conditions, respectively. The ratio is $R = A_{\\mathrm{pass}}/A_{\\mathrm{act}}$.\n$$-20 = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{pass}}}{A_{\\mathrm{act}}}\\right)$$\n$$-1 = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{pass}}}{A_{\\mathrm{act}}}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{pass}}}{A_{\\mathrm{act}}} = 10^{-1} = 0.1$$\nThis is the inferred amplitude ratio. The passive amplitude is $10\\%$ of the active amplitude.\n\nWe now compute the passive damping ratio, $\\zeta_{\\mathrm{pass}}$.

The $-3\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ points correspond to the frequencies at which the power has dropped to half its peak value, which for amplitude means the amplitude has dropped to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of its peak value. For a high-Q oscillator (low $\\zeta$), the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the amplitude resonance curve, which corresponds to the $-3\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ bandwidth $\\Delta\\omega$, is well approximated by:\n$$\\Delta\\omega \\approx 2\\zeta\\omega_0$$\nThis shows that the tuning bandwidth is directly proportional to the damping ratio $\\zeta$.\nQualitatively, since damping increases from the active to the passive state ($\\zeta_{\\mathrm{pass}} > \\zeta_{\\mathrm{act}}$), the bandwidth must also increase. The tuning of the basilar membrane becomes significantly broader or less sharp.\nQuantitatively, the factor by which the bandwidth changes is the ratio of the passive bandwidth to the active bandwidth:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta\\omega_{\\mathrm{pass}}}{\\Delta\\omega_{\\mathrm{act}}} = \\frac{2\\zeta_{\\mathrm{pass}}\\omega_0}{2\\zeta_{\\mathrm{act}}\\omega_0} = \\frac{\\zeta_{\\mathrm{pass}}}{\\zeta_{\\mathrm{act}}} = \\frac{0.5}{0.05} = 10$$\nTherefore, the tuning bandwidth increases by a factor of $10$ upon inactivation of the OHCs.
