The specificities of trypsin and chymotrypsin, the role of P1 and P1' residues, and the unique inhibitory effect of proline at P1' are all well-established scientific facts. The provided numerical values for amino acid frequencies and relative specificities are plausible for a biological context. The problem is sound.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides all necessary data (molar fractions, kinetic constants, specificity rules) to calculate a unique quantitative answer for the distribution of cleavage events. The qualitative part of the question asks for a standard explanation from first principles. The problem is well-posed.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem is phrased in objective, technical language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. It is therefore deemed **valid**. We may proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe problem requires a two-part answer: a quantitative calculation of the distribution of proteolytic events and a qualitative explanation of a specific inhibitory mechanism.\n\n**Part 1: Quantitative Distribution of Cleavage Events**\nThe initial velocity ($V_0$) of an enzymatic reaction at low substrate concentration ($[S] \\ll K_{\\mathrm{M}}$) is approximated by $V_0 \\approx (k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_{\\mathrm{M}})[E][S]$. The problem states that the initial velocity is proportional to the number of eligible peptide bonds weighted by the catalytic efficiency $(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_{\\mathrm{M}})$. The number of potential cleavage sites for a given P1 residue (X) is proportional to its molar fraction, $f_{\\mathrm{X}}$.\n\nAn eligible site must not have proline at the P1' position. Given that residue identities are independent, the probability of the P1' residue *not* being proline is $(1 - f_{\\mathrm{P}})$, where $f_{\\mathrm{P}} = 0.06$.\n\nThe total activity of an enzyme is the sum of its activities on all its substrates. Let $A_{\\text{trypsin}}$ and $A_{\\text{chymotrypsin}}$ represent the total weighted activities. Since enzyme concentrations are equal and we are seeking a relative distribution, we can formulate the activities as follows:\n\nFor **trypsin**, the activity is the sum of contributions from Lysine (K) and Arginine (R) sites:\n$$A_{\\text{trypsin}} \\propto \\left[ f_{\\mathrm{K}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_{\\mathrm{M}}}\\right)_{\\mathrm{K}} + f_{\\mathrm{R}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_{\\mathrm{M}}}\\right)_{\\mathrm{R}} \\right] \\cdot (1 - f_{\\mathrm{P}})$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$f_{\\mathrm{K}} = 0.08$, $(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_{\\mathrm{M}})_{\\mathrm{K}} = 1.0$\n$f_{\\mathrm{R}} = 0.04$, $(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_{\\mathrm{M}})_{\\mathrm{R}} = 0.8$\n$f_{\\mathrm{P}} = 0.06$\n$$A_{\\text{trypsin}} \\propto [ (0.08)(1.0) + (0.04)(0.8) ] \\cdot (1 - 0.06)$$\n$$A_{\\text{trypsin}} \\propto [ 0.08 + 0.032 ] \\cdot (0.94)$$\n$$A_{\\text{trypsin}} \\propto (0.112) \\cdot (0.94) = 0.10528$$\n\nFor **chymotrypsin**, the activity is the sum of contributions from Phenylalanine (F) and Leucine (L) sites:\n$$A_{\\text{chymotrypsin}} \\propto \\left[ f_{\\mathrm{F}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_{\\mathrm{M}}}\\right)_{\\mathrm{F}} + f_{\\mathrm{L}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_{\\mathrm{M}}}\\right)_{\\mathrm{L}} \\right] \\cdot (1 - f_{\\mathrm{P}})$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$f_{\\mathrm{F}} = 0.05$, $(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_{\\mathrm{M}})_{\\mathrm{F}} = 1.2$\n$f_{\\mathrm{L}} = 0.10$, $(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_{\\mathrm{M}})_{\\mathrm{L}} = 0.3$\n$$A_{\\text{chymotrypsin}} \\propto [ (0.05)(1.2) + (0.10)(0.3) ] \\cdot (0.94)$$\n$$A_{\\text{chymotrypsin}} \\propto [ 0.06 + 0.03 ] \\cdot (0.94)$$\n$$A_{\\text{chymotrypsin}} \\propto (0.090) \\cdot (0.94) = 0.08460$$\n\nThe total activity is $A_{\\text{total}} = A_{\\text{trypsin}} + A_{\\text{chymotrypsin}} \\propto 0.10528 + 0.08460 = 0.18988$.\n\nThe fractional contribution of each enzyme is:\nFraction(trypsin) = $\\frac{A_{\\text{trypsin}}}{A_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{0.10528}{0.18988} \\approx 0.55445 \\implies 55.4\\%$\nFraction(chymotrypsin) = $\\frac{A_{\\text{chymotrypsin}}}{A_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{0.08460}{0.18988} \\approx 0.44555 \\implies 44.6\\%$\n\nThe distribution is approximately $55\\%$ trypsin and $45\\%$ chymotrypsin.\n\n**Part 2: Explanation of P1'-Proline Inhibition**\nThe catalytic mechanism of serine proteases like trypsin and chymotrypsin requires the substrate peptide segment to bind in an extended, $\\beta$-strand-like conformation. This binding is stabilized by the formation of an antiparallel $\\beta$-sheet between the substrate backbone and the enzyme. A crucial interaction for positioning the scissile bond (the P1-P1' bond) is a hydrogen bond between the backbone amide proton of the P1' residue and a backbone carbonyl group on the enzyme (for instance, the carbonyl of Ser214 in chymotrypsin).\n\nProline is structurally unique among the proteinogenic amino acids. Its side chain cyclizes back onto its own backbone nitrogen atom, forming a secondary amine (or \"imino acid\" when in a peptide). This has two major consequences for its role at the P1' position:\n1.  **Conformational Constraint:** The cyclic structure fixes the backbone dihedral angle $\\phi$ to a narrow range (approximately $-60^\\circ$), which is incompatible with the extended conformation required for productive binding in the active site. This introduces a \"kink\" that sterically prevents the substrate from adopting the necessary \"near-attack\" conformation for catalysis.\n2.  **Loss of a Hydrogen Bond Donor:** As a secondary amine, the backbone nitrogen of a proline residue lacks a hydrogen atom. It cannot act as a hydrogen bond donor. This abolishes the critical hydrogen bond that secures the P1' residue within the S1' subsite of the enzyme, severely destabilizing the enzyme-substrate complex.\n\nTherefore, the combination of profound steric hindrance and the loss of a key stabilizing hydrogen bond explains why serine proteases are unable to cleave peptide bonds where proline occupies the P1' position.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Approximately $55\\%$ trypsin and $45\\%$ chymotrypsin; proline at $\\mathrm{P1'}$ abolishes a key backbone amide hydrogen bond to the enzyme and constrains the $\\phi/\\psi$ angles of the scissile bond, preventing formation of the near-attack conformation and proper occupancy of $\\mathrm{S1'}$, thereby inhibiting catalysis in both enzymes.**\n- **Calculation:** The calculated distribution of $55\\%$ trypsin and $45\\%$ chymotrypsin is correct.\n- **Explanation:** The explanation is precise and correct from first principles. It correctly identifies the loss of the P1' backbone amide hydrogen bond and the rigid conformational constraints imposed by the proline ring (fixed $\\phi$ angle) as the dual reasons for inhibition. These factors prevent proper binding in the S1' subsite and establishment of the catalytic geometry. The mechanism applies to both enzymes.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Approximately $60\\%$ chymotrypsin and $40\\%$ trypsin; proline blocks cleavage by electrostatic repulsion between its side chain and the conserved aspartate at the base of trypsinâ€™s $\\mathrm{S1}$ pocket.**\n- **Calculation:** The distribution is incorrect. The calculation yields $55\\%/45\\%$, not $40\\%/60\\%$.\n- **Explanation:** The explanation is factually incorrect. The aspartate in trypsin's S1 pocket is for recognizing the positively charged P1 residue (Lys/Arg), not the P1' residue. Proline is at P1', not P1. Furthermore, proline's side chain is nonpolar and uncharged, so it cannot cause electrostatic repulsion with an aspartate. This is a complete misrepresentation of the enzyme mechanism.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Approximately $55\\%$ trypsin and $45\\%$ chymotrypsin; proline near the scissile bond increases cleavage by pre-organizing the bond through ring strain that is relieved upon hydrolysis.**\n- **Calculation:** The distribution is correct.\n- **Explanation:** The explanation is incorrect. It claims proline *increases* cleavage, which contradicts both the problem statement and established biochemical knowledge. Serine proteases do not cleave X-Pro bonds; specialized prolyl peptidases are required for this task. The premise of the explanation is false.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Approximately $50\\%$ trypsin and $50\\%$ chymotrypsin; proline at $\\mathrm{P1'}$ blocks trypsin but has no effect on chymotrypsin because chymotrypsin does not rely on backbone hydrogen bonding.**\n- **Calculation:** The distribution of $50\\%/50\\%$ is an inaccurate approximation. The calculated values are $0.112$ and $0.090$, which are distinct enough that a $55\\%/45\\%$ split is a more accurate representation.\n- **Explanation:** The explanation is incorrect. The inhibition by P1'-proline is a general feature for this family of proteases because they share a common catalytic mechanism and substrate-binding motif. The claim that chymotrypsin does not rely on backbone hydrogen bonding is false; this bonding is fundamental to the mechanism of all canonical serine proteases.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2562889"}, {"introduction": "Once proteins are broken down into amino acids, the next challenge is to transport them into the intestinal epithelial cells, often against a significant concentration gradient.

System L is an obligate exchanger: the transporter alternates access and mediates exchange of an extracellular substrate for an intracellular counter-substrate on the same transport cycle. In this preparation, other transport systems are inhibited so that only System L contributes to branched-chain neutral amino acid movement. The apical exchanger binds leucine (Leu) and isoleucine (Ile) at a single external site with competitive kinetics and identical affinity. The intracellular counter-substrate pool for the apical exchanger is large and approximately constant on the time scale of the apical uptake measurements. The basolateral exchanger mediates efflux of intracellular branched-chain amino acids into the interstitium in exchange for extracellular neutral amino acids; however, the interstitial concentrations of potential exchange partners are experimentally clamped to very low values, making basolateral exchange partner availability limiting for the basolateral step.\n\nAssume the following parameters are empirically determined for the apical exchanger at a fixed internal counter-substrate activity: the maximal turnover rate is $V_{\\max,\\mathrm{apical}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and the Michaelis constant ($K_m$) for both leucine and isoleucine is $K_{m,\\mathrm{Leu}} = K_{m,\\mathrm{Ile}} = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.

A rigorous solution can be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe analysis proceeds in two parts: first, the calculation of apical influx for each scenario using the equation for competitive inhibition, and second, determination of the net transepithelial flux by comparing the total apical influx to the basolateral efflux capacity.\n\nThe rate of transport ($J_S$) of a substrate $S$ in the presence of a competitive inhibitor $I$, where both have the same affinity ($K_m$), is given by the Michaelis-Menten equation for competitive inhibition:\n$$J_S = \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_m + [S] + [I]}$$\nThe total rate of transport for both substrates is:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\frac{V_{\\max} ([S] + [I])}{K_m + [S] + [I]}$$\n\nWe are given $V_{\\max,\\mathrm{apical}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $K_m = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ for both $Leu$ and $Ile$.\n\n**Analysis of Scenario One**\nIn this scenario, $[Leu]_1 = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ and $[Ile]_1 = 0\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\nThe apical influx of leucine ($J_{\\mathrm{Leu},1}$) is calculated using the standard Michaelis-Menten equation, as no competitor is present:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{Leu},1} = \\frac{V_{\\max,\\mathrm{apical}} [Leu]_1}{K_m + [Leu]_1} = \\frac{(100\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) (0.10\\,\\mathrm{mM})}{0.05\\,\\mathrm{mM} + 0.10\\,\\mathrm{mM}} = \\frac{10}{0.15}\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx 66.67\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe total apical influx of BCAAs is solely due to leucine: $J_{\\mathrm{total},1} = J_{\\mathrm{Leu},1} \\approx 66.67\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\n**Analysis of Scenario Two**\nIn this scenario, $[Leu]_2 = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ and $[Ile]_2 = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\nThe apical influx of leucine ($J_{\\mathrm{Leu},2}$) is now reduced by the competitive presence of isoleucine:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{Leu},2} = \\frac{V_{\\max,\\mathrm{apical}} [Leu]_2}{K_m + [Leu]_2 + [Ile]_2} = \\frac{(100\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) (0.10\\,\\mathrm{mM})}{0.05\\,\\mathrm{mM} + 0.10\\,\\mathrm{mM} + 0.10\\,\\mathrm{mM}} = \\frac{10}{0.25}\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 40\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nDue to identical concentrations and affinities, the apical influx of isoleucine ($J_{\\mathrm{Ile},2}$) is equal to that of leucine: $J_{\\mathrm{Ile},2} = 40\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nThe total apical influx of BCAAs ($J_{\\mathrm{total},2}$) is the sum of the individual fluxes:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{total},2} = J_{\\mathrm{Leu},2} + J_{\\mathrm{Ile},2} = 40 + 40 = 80\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nAlternatively, using the formula for total flux:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{total},2} = \\frac{V_{\\max,\\mathrm{apical}} ([Leu]_2 + [Ile]_2)}{K_m + [Leu]_2 + [Ile]_2} = \\frac{(100)(0.10 + 0.10)}{0.05 + 0.10 + 0.10} = \\frac{100 \\times 0.20}{0.25} = \\frac{20}{0.25} = 80\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n\n**Comparison of Apical Influxes**\n- Leucine influx decreases from $\\approx 66.67\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ in scenario one to $40\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ in scenario two.\n- Total BCAA influx increases from $\\approx 66.67\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ in scenario one to $80\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ in scenario two. The higher total substrate concentration ($0.20\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ vs $0.10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$) leads to a greater overall occupancy and turnover of the transporter, despite the competition.\n\n**Determination of Net Transepithelial Flux**\nThe net flux across the epithelium is the minimum of the rate of apical entry and the maximal rate of basolateral exit. The basolateral exit is capped at $V_{\\mathrm{cap,baso}} = 30\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n- **Net flux in scenario one:** $J_{\\mathrm{net},1} = \\min(J_{\\mathrm{total},1}, V_{\\mathrm{cap,baso}}) = \\min(66.67, 30) = 30\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The basolateral step is rate-limiting.\n- **Net flux in scenario two:** $J_{\\mathrm{net},2} = \\min(J_{\\mathrm{total},2}, V_{\\mathrm{cap,baso}}) = \\min(80, 30) = 30\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The basolateral step remains rate-limiting.\n\nThus, the net transepithelial flux of total BCAAs remains unchanged at $30\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\n**Composition of Net Efflux**\n- In scenario one, the net efflux consists entirely of leucine. Its fraction of the total flux is $1$.\n- In scenario two, the apical membrane transports leucine and isoleucine in a $1:1$ ratio ($40:40$). This influx ratio determines the composition of the transportable intracellular pool. Assuming the basolateral transporter does not discriminate between intracellular $Leu$ and $Ile$, the efflux will also be in a $1:1$ ratio. Therefore, the net efflux of $30\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ will be composed of approximately $15\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ of leucine and $15\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ of isoleucine. Leucine's fraction of the net efflux decreases from $1$ to approximately $0.5$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. The apical leucine influx is reduced by the presence of isoleucine due to competitive inhibition, but the total apical branched-chain amino acid influx increases; nevertheless, the net transepithelial flux of total branched-chain amino acids remains unchanged at the basolateral cap, and leucineâ€™s fraction of the net efflux decreases.\nThis statement accurately reflects all four conclusions from our derivation:\n1.  Apical leucine influx is reduced (from $\\approx 66.7$ to $40\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$).\n2.  Total apical influx increases (from $\\approx 66.7$ to $80\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$).\n3.  Net transepithelial flux remains unchanged (at $30\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$).\n4.  Leucine's fraction of the net efflux decreases (from $1$ to $\\approx 0.5$).\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. The apical leucine influx increases because isoleucine on the luminal side trans-stimulates leucine entry; the total apical influx falls, yet the net transepithelial flux of total branched-chain amino acids increases despite the basolateral limitation.\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. Apical leucine influx decreases, it does not increase. The mechanism is competitive inhibition, not trans-stimulation. The total apical influx increases, it does not fall. The net transepithelial flux remains unchanged, it does not increase.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. The apical leucine influx is unchanged, the total apical influx doubles with the addition of isoleucine, and the net transepithelial flux of total branched-chain amino acids doubles accordingly.\nThis statement is entirely false. Apical leucine influx decreases. Total apical influx increases, but does not double (from $\\approx 66.7$ to $80\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). Net transepithelial flux remains unchanged due to the basolateral cap, it does not double.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Both leucine and isoleucine apical influxes fall, the total apical influx diminishes below that in scenario one, and the net transepithelial flux decreases because the apical step becomes rate-limiting even though basolateral exchange partners are scarce.\nThis statement is incorrect. The isoleucine influx increases from $0$ to $40\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$; it does not fall. The total apical influx increases, it does not diminish. The net flux does not decrease, and the apical step does not become rate-limiting, as its rate ($80\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) is still greater than the basolateral cap ($30\\,\\mathrm{pmol}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$).\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2562848"}]}
