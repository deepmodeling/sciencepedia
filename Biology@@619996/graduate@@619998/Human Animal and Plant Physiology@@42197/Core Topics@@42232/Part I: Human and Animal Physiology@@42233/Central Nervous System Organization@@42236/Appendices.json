Let $\\mathbf{r}(t) = \\mathbf{r}^* + \\delta\\mathbf{r}(t)$, where $\\delta\\mathbf{r}(t)$ is a small perturbation.\nSubstituting this into the dynamical equation yields:\n$$ \\tau \\frac{d}{dt} (\\mathbf{r}^* + \\delta\\mathbf{r}) = -(\\mathbf{r}^* + \\delta\\mathbf{r}) + \\Phi(W(\\mathbf{r}^* + \\delta\\mathbf{r}) + \\mathbf{I}^{\\mathrm{ext}}) $$\nThe left-hand side is $\\tau \\frac{d}{dt}\\delta\\mathbf{r}$. For the right-hand side, we perform a first-order Taylor expansion of the nonlinear function $\\Phi$ around the fixed-point input $\\mathbf{u}^* = W\\mathbf{r}^* + \\mathbf{I}^{\\mathrm{ext}}$:\n$$ \\Phi(W\\mathbf{r}^* + \\mathbf{I}^{\\mathrm{ext}} + W\\delta\\mathbf{r}) \\approx \\Phi(W\\mathbf{r}^* + \\mathbf{I}^{\\mathrm{ext}}) + J_{\\Phi}|_{\\mathbf{u}^*} (W\\delta\\mathbf{r}) $$\nThe Jacobian matrix of $\\Phi$ evaluated at $\\mathbf{u}^*$, denoted $J_{\\Phi}|_{\\mathbf{u}^*}$, is the diagonal matrix of gains $G = \\mathrm{diag}(g_E, g_I)$.\nThe expansion becomes $\\Phi(\\mathbf{u}^*) + G W \\delta\\mathbf{r}$. Substituting this into the dynamical equation for the perturbation:\n$$ \\tau \\frac{d}{dt}\\delta\\mathbf{r} = -(\\mathbf{r}^* + \\delta\\mathbf{r}) + [\\mathbf{r}^* + G W \\delta\\mathbf{r}] $$\nThe fixed-point terms $\\mathbf{r}^*$ cancel out, leaving a linear differential equation for the perturbation $\\delta\\mathbf{r}$:\n$$ \\tau \\frac{d}{dt}\\delta\\mathbf{r} = -\\delta\\mathbf{r} + G W \\delta\\mathbf{r} = (GW - I) \\delta\\mathbf{r} $$\nwhere $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix. The stability of the fixed point is determined by the eigenvalues of the system's Jacobian matrix, which is $J = \\frac{1}{\\tau}(GW - I)$. For the fixed point to be locally stable, the real part of all eigenvalues of $J$ must be negative. Let $\\lambda_J$ be an eigenvalue of $J$. The condition is $\\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda_J)  0$.\nThe eigenvalues of $J$ are related to the eigenvalues of the dimensionless matrix $GW$. Let $\\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $GW$. Then the corresponding eigenvalue of $GW - I$ is $\\lambda - 1$, and the corresponding eigenvalue of $J$ is $\\lambda_J = \\frac{\\lambda - 1}{\\tau}$.\nThe stability condition becomes:\n$$ \\mathrm{Re}\\left(\\frac{\\lambda - 1}{\\tau}\\right)  0 $$\nSince $\\tau$ is a positive real constant, this is equivalent to:\n$$ \\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda - 1)  0 \\implies \\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda) - 1  0 \\implies \\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda)  1 $$\nThis condition must hold for all eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of the matrix $GW$. This is the necessary and sufficient condition for the local stability of the fixed point.\n\nTask 2: Calculation of Steady-State Firing Rates.\n\nThe steady-state firing rates $(r_E, r_I)$ are determined by the balance constraint equation:\n$$ W\\mathbf{r} + \\mathbf{I}^{\\mathrm{ext}} = \\mathbf{u}^* $$\nThis is a system of linear equations for $\\mathbf{r} = \\begin{pmatrix} r_E \\\\ r_I \\end{pmatrix}$:\n$$ W\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{u}^* - \\mathbf{I}^{\\mathrm{ext}} $$\nThe solution is $\\mathbf{r} = W^{-1} (\\mathbf{u}^* - \\mathbf{I}^{\\mathrm{ext}})$, provided $W$ is invertible.\nFirst, we compute the vector $\\mathbf{u}^* - \\mathbf{I}^{\\mathrm{ext}}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{u}^* - \\mathbf{I}^{\\mathrm{ext}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.0 \\\\ 0.8 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 6.0 \\\\ 2.0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -5.0 \\\\ -1.2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNext, we find the inverse of $W = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.1  -0.4 \\\\ 0.6  -0.5 \\end{pmatrix}$. The determinant is:\n$$ \\det(W) = (0.1)(-0.5) - (-0.4)(0.6) = -0.05 + 0.24 = 0.19 $$\nSince $\\det(W) \\neq 0$, the inverse exists:\n$$ W^{-1} = \\frac{1}{0.19} \\begin{pmatrix} -0.5  0.4 \\\\ -0.6  0.1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow we can solve for $\\mathbf{r}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{r} = \\frac{1}{0.19} \\begin{pmatrix} -0.5  0.4 \\\\ -0.6  0.1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -5.0 \\\\ -1.2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{0.19} \\begin{pmatrix} (-0.5)(-5.0) + (0.4)(-1.2) \\\\ (-0.6)(-5.0) + (0.1)(-1.2) \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{r} = \\frac{1}{0.19} \\begin{pmatrix} 2.5 - 0.48 \\\\ 3.0 - 0.12 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{0.19} \\begin{pmatrix} 2.02 \\\\ 2.88 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ r_E = \\frac{2.02}{0.19} \\approx 10.63157... \\quad \\mathrm{Hz} $$\n$$ r_I = \\frac{2.88}{0.19} \\approx 15.15789... \\quad \\mathrm{Hz} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$ r_E \\approx 10.6 \\quad \\mathrm{Hz}, \\quad r_I \\approx 15.2 \\quad \\mathrm{Hz} $$\n\nTask 3: Stability Verification.\n\nTo verify the stability of this fixed point, we must compute the eigenvalues of the matrix $GW$ and check if their real parts are less than $1$.\nThe gain matrix is $G = \\mathrm{diag}(0.15, 0.20) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.15  0 \\\\ 0  0.20 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe product $GW$ is:\n$$ GW = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.15  0 \\\\ 0  0.20 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.1  -0.4 \\\\ 0.6  -0.5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.15 \\times 0.1  0.15 \\times (-0.4) \\\\ 0.20 \\times 0.6  0.20 \\times (-0.5) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.015  -0.06 \\\\ 0.12  -0.10 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $GW$ are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(GW - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$ (0.015 - \\lambda)(-0.10 - \\lambda) - (-0.06)(0.12) = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 + 0.10\\lambda - 0.015\\lambda - 0.0015 + 0.0072 = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 + 0.085\\lambda + 0.0057 = 0 $$\nWe can find the eigenvalues using the quadratic formula $\\lambda = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ with $a=1$, $b=0.085$, and $c=0.0057$.\nThe discriminant is $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (0.085)^2 - 4(1)(0.0057) = 0.007225 - 0.0228 = -0.015575$.\nSince the discriminant is negative, the eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair. The real part of both eigenvalues is given by $-\\frac{b}{2a}$.\n$$ \\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda) = -\\frac{0.085}{2} = -0.0425 $$\nThe stability condition is $\\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda)  1$.\nSince $-0.0425  1$, the condition holds for both eigenvalues. Therefore, the fixed point is locally stable. The non-zero imaginary part of the eigenvalues indicates that perturbations will decay in an oscillatory manner.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} 10.6  15.2 \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2556675"}]}
