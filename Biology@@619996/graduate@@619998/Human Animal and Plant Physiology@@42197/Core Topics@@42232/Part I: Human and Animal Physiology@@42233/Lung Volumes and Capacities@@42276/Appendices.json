It is well-posed, providing all necessary data and a clear objective. The language is precise and objective. There are no contradictions, no scientific impossibilities, and no ambiguities. The problem requires a standard derivation and calculation, not a trivial exercise.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is deemed valid. A solution will be produced.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this problem is that the amount of dry gas exhaled from the lungs is conserved when measured by the spirometer. Let $n_{dry}$ be the number of moles of dry gas. We can apply the ideal gas law, $PV=nRT$, to this constant amount of dry gas under two different sets of conditions: Body Temperature and Pressure Saturated (BTPS) and Ambient Temperature and Pressure Saturated (ATPS).\n\nAccording to Dalton's law of partial pressures, the total pressure of the gas mixture, which is the barometric pressure $P_B$, is the sum of the partial pressure of the dry gas, $P_{dry}$, and the partial pressure of the water vapor, $P_{H_2O}$. Therefore, the partial pressure of the dry gas is given by:\n$$P_{dry} = P_B - P_{H_2O}$$\n\nWe apply this to the two states.\n\n**State 1: Inside the lungs (BTPS conditions)**\nThe gas is at body temperature, $T_{BTPS}$, and is saturated with water vapor at this temperature. The volume is the true vital capacity, $V_{BTPS}$. The partial pressure of the dry gas is $P_{dry, BTPS} = P_B - P_{H_2O, BTPS}$. The ideal gas law for the dry gas component is:\n$$ (P_B - P_{H_2O, BTPS}) V_{BTPS} = n_{dry} R T_{BTPS} $$\nwhere $R$ is the ideal gas constant.\n\n**State 2: Inside the spirometer (ATPS conditions)**\nThe gas has cooled to the ambient temperature, $T_{ATPS}$, and remains saturated with water vapor, but now at this lower temperature. The measured volume is $V_{ATPS}$. The partial pressure of the dry gas is $P_{dry, ATPS} = P_B - P_{H_2O, ATPS}$. The ideal gas law for the dry gas component is:\n$$ (P_B - P_{H_2O, ATPS}) V_{ATPS} = n_{dry} R T_{ATPS} $$\n\nSince $n_{dry}$ and $R$ are constants, we can equate the expressions for $n_{dry}R$ from both states:\n$$ \\frac{(P_B - P_{H_2O, BTPS}) V_{BTPS}}{T_{BTPS}} = \\frac{(P_B - P_{H_2O, ATPS}) V_{ATPS}}{T_{ATPS}} $$\n\nThis equation establishes the relationship between the volumes, pressures, and temperatures in the two states. The task requires deriving the relation for the BTPS-corrected volume, $V_{BTPS}$. We rearrange the equation to solve for $V_{BTPS}$:\n$$ V_{BTPS} = V_{ATPS} \\cdot \\frac{P_B - P_{H_2O, ATPS}}{P_B - P_{H_2O, BTPS}} \\cdot \\frac{T_{BTPS}}{T_{ATPS}} $$\nThis is the required general relation for BTPS correction.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value. First, all temperatures must be converted to the absolute Kelvin scale using the provided formula $T[\\mathrm{K}]=T[^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}]+273.15$:\n$$ T_{ATPS} = 20 + 273.15 = 293.15\\ \\mathrm{K} $$\n$$ T_{BTPS} = 37 + 273.15 = 310.15\\ \\mathrm{K} $$\n\nNext, we substitute the given numerical values into the derived formula:\n- $V_{ATPS} = 3.60\\ \\mathrm{L}$\n- $P_B = 748\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- $P_{H_2O, ATPS} = 17.5\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- $P_{H_2O, BTPS} = 47.0\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- $T_{ATPS} = 293.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- $T_{BTPS} = 310.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n\n$$ V_{BTPS} = 3.60\\ \\mathrm{L} \\cdot \\frac{748 - 17.5}{748 - 47.0} \\cdot \\frac{310.15}{293.15} $$\n$$ V_{BTPS} = 3.60 \\cdot \\frac{730.5}{701.0} \\cdot \\frac{310.15}{293.15} $$\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$ V_{BTPS} \\approx 3.60 \\cdot (1.0420827...) \\cdot (1.0580009...) $$\n$$ V_{BTPS} \\approx 3.60 \\cdot (1.102524...) $$\n$$ V_{BTPS} \\approx 3.969086...\\ \\mathrm{L} $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$ V_{BTPS} \\approx 3.97\\ \\mathrm{L} $$\n\nThe correction factor is significant, as the volume occupied by a given amount of gas increases with temperature and decreases with the partial pressure of dry gas.

The problem is objective and free of ambiguity.\n\nStep 3: Verdict.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested. First, the derivation of the expression for alveolar ventilation, $\\dot{V}_{A}$. Second, the numerical evaluation of the ratio for the specified breathing patterns.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of Alveolar Ventilation ($\\dot{V}_{A}$)\nBy definition, the tidal volume ($V_{T}$) is the volume of air inhaled or exhaled in a single breath. This volume is partitioned into two components. One part fills the conducting airways, the volume of which is the anatomical dead space ($V_{D}$). This air does not participate in gas exchange. The remaining part of the tidal volume reaches the alveoli and constitutes the alveolar volume ($V_{A,\\text{breath}}$) for that breath.\nBased on the principle of conservation of volume for a single inspiration, we have:\n$$V_{T} = V_{A,\\text{breath}} + V_{D}$$\nFrom this, the volume of fresh gas reaching the alveoli in a single breath is:\n$$V_{A,\\text{breath}} = V_{T} - V_{D}$$\nAlveolar ventilation, $\\dot{V}_{A}$, is defined as the total volume of fresh gas entering the alveoli per unit time. It is the product of the respiratory frequency ($f$) and the alveolar volume per breath ($V_{A,\\text{breath}}$):\n$$\\dot{V}_{A} = f \\times V_{A,\\text{breath}} = f \\times (V_{T} - V_{D})$$\nThe problem requires an expression in terms of minute ventilation ($\\dot{V}_{E}$), tidal volume ($V_{T}$), and dead space volume ($V_{D}$). The minute ventilation is defined as $\\dot{V}_{E} = f \\times V_{T}$. From this definition, we can express the frequency as $f = \\frac{\\dot{V}_{E}}{V_{T}}$.\nSubstituting this expression for $f$ into the equation for $\\dot{V}_{A}$ yields:\n$$\\dot{V}_{A} = \\left(\\frac{\\dot{V}_{E}}{V_{T}}\\right) \\times (V_{T} - V_{D})$$\nThis expression can be rearranged to a more instructive form:\n$$\\dot{V}_{A} = \\dot{V}_{E} \\left(1 - \\frac{V_{D}}{V_{T}}\\right)$$\nThis is the required expression. It demonstrates that for a fixed minute ventilation $\\dot{V}_{E}$, the alveolar ventilation $\\dot{V}_{A}$ is determined by the ratio of dead space to tidal volume. A larger tidal volume diminishes the wasteful effect of the constant dead space.\n\nPart 2: Numerical Evaluation of the Ratio $R$\nWe now apply the fundamental formula $\\dot{V}_{A} = f \\times (V_{T} - V_{D})$ to calculate the alveolar ventilation for each of the two breathing patterns. All volumes are in mL and frequency is in breaths/min, so the resulting ventilation will be in mL/min.\n\nFor the shallow–rapid pattern (subscript S):\n$f_{S} = 30$ min$^{-1}$\n$V_{T,S} = 200$ mL\n$V_{D} = 150$ mL\nThe alveolar ventilation is:\n$$\\dot{V}_{A,S} = f_{S} \\times (V_{T,S} - V_{D}) = 30 \\times (200 - 150) = 30 \\times 50 = 1500 \\text{ mL/min}$$\n\nFor the deep–slow pattern (subscript D):\n$f_{D} = 10$ min$^{-1}$\n$V_{T,D} = 600$ mL\n$V_{D} = 150$ mL\nThe alveolar ventilation is:\n$$\\dot{V}_{A,D} = f_{D} \\times (V_{T,D} - V_{D}) = 10 \\times (600 - 150) = 10 \\times 450 = 4500 \\text{ mL/min}$$\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the ratio $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{\\dot{V}_{A,D}}{\\dot{V}_{A,S}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$R = \\frac{4500}{1500} = 3$$\nThe result is a dimensionless number, confirming the dimensional consistency of the calculation. This result demonstrates that for the same total minute ventilation, the deep, slow breathing pattern is three times more effective at ventilating the alveoli than the shallow, rapid pattern.

The first measurement is whole-body plethysmography to obtain thoracic gas volume at functional residual capacity (FRC), and the second is closed-circuit helium dilution to obtain the communicating portion of FRC. Assume all gases behave ideally, all processes described are quasi-static and isothermal at body temperature, and there are no leaks.

Helium is assumed insoluble in blood and tissue over the time course of the test, and mixing is complete at equilibrium.

Do not include any units in your final boxed answer.", "solution": "The problem posed is a valid and well-posed problem in respiratory biophysics. It requires the application of fundamental physical laws to physiological measurements. We will address the three tasks sequentially.\n\nFirst, we address the derivation and calculation of the functional residual capacity as measured by whole-body plethysmography ($V_{\\text{FRC,pleth}}$). This measurement is based on Boyle's Law, which states that for a fixed amount of gas at a constant temperature, the product of pressure $P$ and volume $V$ is constant ($P \\cdot V = k$). This is a direct consequence of the ideal gas law, $PV = nRT$, for constant molar quantity $n$ and temperature $T$. The problem states that the process is isothermal.\n\nDuring the plethysmography maneuver, the subject performs small-amplitude panting efforts against an occluded airway at their functional residual capacity. This creates two coupled thermodynamic systems under isothermal conditions: the gas within the subject's thorax and the air within the sealed plethysmograph box.\n\nFor the gas within the thorax, we apply Boyle's Law. Let the initial volume be $V_{\\text{FRC,pleth}}$ and the initial alveolar pressure be $P_{A}$. During a panting effort, the pressure changes by $\\Delta P_{A}$ and the volume of the gas changes by $\\Delta V$.\n$$P_{A} V_{\\text{FRC,pleth}} = (P_{A} + \\Delta P_{A})(V_{\\text{FRC,pleth}} + \\Delta V_{\\text{gas}})$$\nExpanding this expression gives:\n$$P_{A} V_{\\text{FRC,pleth}} = P_{A} V_{\\text{FRC,pleth}} + P_{A} \\Delta V_{\\text{gas}} + \\Delta P_{A} V_{\\text{FRC,pleth}} + \\Delta P_{A} \\Delta V_{\\text{gas}}$$\nSince the changes are small, the second-order term $\\Delta P_{A} \\Delta V_{\\text{gas}}$ is negligible compared to the first-order terms. This simplifies to:\n$$0 \\approx P_{A} \\Delta V_{\\text{gas}} + \\Delta P_{A} V_{\\text{FRC,pleth}}$$\nThe change in gas volume $\\Delta V_{\\text{gas}}$ is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the change in thoracic volume, let us call it $\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}$, that compresses the gas. Thus $\\Delta V_{\\text{gas}} = -\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}$.\n$$-P_{A} \\Delta V_{\\text{th}} + \\Delta P_{A} V_{\\text{FRC,pleth}} \\approx 0 \\implies \\Delta V_{\\text{th}} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta P_{A} V_{\\text{FRC,pleth}}}{P_{A}}$$\n\nFor the air within the plethysmograph box, the change in the subject's thoracic volume, $\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}$, causes an equal change in the volume of air in the box, but of opposite sign. Let the volume of air in the box be $V_{b}$, and its pressure be $P_{b}$. Applying Boyle's Law to the box air:\n$$P_{b} V_{b} = (P_{b} + \\Delta P_{b})(V_{b} - \\Delta V_{\\text{th}})$$\nExpanding and neglecting the second-order term $\\Delta P_{b} \\Delta V_{\\text{th}}$:\n$$P_{b} V_{b} \\approx P_{b} V_{b} - P_{b} \\Delta V_{\\text{th}} + \\Delta P_{b} V_{b}$$\n$$P_{b} \\Delta V_{\\text{th}} \\approx \\Delta P_{b} V_{b} \\implies \\Delta V_{\\text{th}} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta P_{b} V_{b}}{P_{b}}$$\n\nWe now equate the two expressions for $\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}$:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta P_{A} V_{\\text{FRC,pleth}}}{P_{A}} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta P_{b} V_{b}}{P_{b}}$$\nInitially, the pressures in the lung and the box are both equal to the ambient barometric pressure, $P_{A} \\approx P_{b} \\approx P_{\\text{amb}}$. The explicit value of this pressure is not necessary because it cancels out. The problem states that alveolar pressure equals mouth pressure, so $\\Delta P_A = \\Delta P_m$. The provided volume $V_b$ is specified as the volume of air in the box. Therefore, we obtain the expression for plethysmographic FRC:\n$$V_{\\text{FRC,pleth}} = V_{b} \\frac{\\Delta P_{b}}{\\Delta P_{m}}$$\nUsing the provided values: $V_{b} = 700.0\\ \\text{L}$, $\\Delta P_{b} = 0.005425\\ \\text{cmH}_{2}\\text{O}$, and $\\Delta P_{m} = 1.00\\ \\text{cmH}_{2}\\text{O}$. The pressure units are consistent and cancel in the ratio.\n$$V_{\\text{FRC,pleth}} = 700.0\\ \\text{L} \\times \\frac{0.005425}{1.00} = 3.7975\\ \\text{L}$$\n\nSecond, we address the derivation and calculation of the communicating portion of FRC using helium dilution ($V_{\\text{FRC,dil}}$). This technique is based on the principle of conservation of matter. The amount (moles) of the inert tracer gas, helium, is constant before and after it equilibrates between the circuit and the subject's lungs.\nThe amount of a gas, $n$, in a volume $V$ at pressure $P$ and temperature $T$ is given by the ideal gas law as $n = \\frac{PV}{RT}$. The amount of helium, $n_{\\text{He}}$, is its mole fraction $X_{\\text{He}}$ times the total moles, $n_{\\text{total}}$. Thus, $n_{\\text{He}} = X_{\\text{He}} \\frac{PV}{RT}$.\n\nInitial state: The helium is contained entirely within the circuit of volume $V_{s}$ at an initial mole fraction $X_{\\text{He},i}$. The lungs, with communicating volume $V_{\\text{FRC,dil}}$, contain no helium ($X_{\\text{He}} = 0$). The total initial amount of helium is:\n$$n_{\\text{He},i} = X_{\\text{He},i} \\frac{P V_{s}}{RT}$$\nFinal state: After equilibration, the helium is distributed throughout the total volume $V_{s} + V_{\\text{FRC,dil}}$ at a final uniform mole fraction $X_{\\text{He},f}$. The total final amount of helium is:\n$$n_{\\text{He},f} = X_{\\text{He},f} \\frac{P (V_{s} + V_{\\text{FRC,dil}})}{RT}$$\nBy conservation of matter, $n_{\\text{He},i} = n_{\\text{He},f}$. Since the test is performed under constant temperature and pressure (BTPS conditions specified throughout), the term $\\frac{P}{RT}$ is constant and cancels:\n$$X_{\\text{He},i} V_{s} = X_{\\text{He},f} (V_{s} + V_{\\text{FRC,dil}})$$\nWe rearrange this expression to solve for $V_{\\text{FRC,dil}}$:\n$$X_{\\text{He},i} V_{s} = X_{\\text{He},f} V_{s} + X_{\\text{He},f} V_{\\text{FRC,dil}}$$\n$$V_{\\text{FRC,dil}} X_{\\text{He},f} = V_{s} (X_{\\text{He},i} - X_{\\text{He},f})$$\n$$V_{\\text{FRC,dil}} = V_{s} \\left(\\frac{X_{\\text{He},i} - X_{\\text{He},f}}{X_{\\text{He},f}}\\right) = V_{s} \\left(\\frac{X_{\\text{He},i}}{X_{\\text{He},f}} - 1\\right)$$\nUsing the provided values: $V_{s} = 6.000\\ \\text{L}$, $X_{\\text{He},i} = 0.1000$, and $X_{\\text{He},f} = 0.07500$.\n$$V_{\\text{FRC,dil}} = 6.000\\ \\text{L} \\times \\left(\\frac{0.1000}{0.07500} - 1\\right) = 6.000\\ \\text{L} \\times \\left(\\frac{4}{3} - 1\\right) = 6.000\\ \\text{L} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 2.000\\ \\text{L}$$\n\nThird, we compute the trapped gas volume ($V_{\\text{trapped}}$) and provide a clinical interpretation. The problem defines trapped gas as the difference between the total thoracic gas volume measured by plethysmography and the communicating gas volume measured by dilution.\n$$V_{\\text{trapped}} = V_{\\text{FRC,pleth}} - V_{\\text{FRC,dil}}$$\nSubstituting the computed values:\n$$V_{\\text{trapped}} = 3.7975\\ \\text{L} - 2.000\\ \\text{L} = 1.7975\\ \\text{L}$$\nAs per the instruction, this final value must be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$V_{\\text{trapped}} \\approx 1.798\\ \\text{L}$$\n\nClinically, the existence of a significant trapped gas volume is a key indicator of obstructive lung disease, as stated for the subject. $V_{\\text{FRC,pleth}}$ measures all gas within the thorax, including gas in poorly ventilated or non-ventilated lung regions distal to collapsed or obstructed airways. In contrast, $V_{\\text{FRC,dil}}$ measures only the lung volume that communicates with the central airways, as the helium tracer gas can only mix into these regions. The difference, $V_{\\text{trapped}}$, quantifies the volume of gas that is \"trapped\" and does not participate in ventilation during the time frame of the test. In this subject with chronic airflow limitation, the plethysmographic FRC of $3.7975\\ \\text{L}$ is elevated above typical normal values ($2.5-3.0\\ \\text{L}$), a condition known as hyperinflation. The trapped gas volume of $1.798\\ \\text{L}$ is substantial, comprising approximately $47\\%$ of the total thoracic gas volume at FRC ($1.798 / 3.7975 \\approx 0.473$). This large volume of non-communicating gas constitutes a severe ventilation defect, which leads to ventilation-perfusion mismatching and is a primary cause of impaired gas exchange (hypoxemia and hypercapnia) in patients with severe obstructive lung disease.
