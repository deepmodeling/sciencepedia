It is a standard, fundamental exercise in quantitative biology.\n- **Action**: Proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested: derivation, calculation, and interpretation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Fractional Occupancy ($Y$)**\n\nWe begin by defining the reversible binding reaction between a free receptor, $R$, and a free ligand, $L$, to form a receptor-ligand complex, $C$.\n$$\nR + L \\rightleftharpoons C\n$$\nAccording to the law of mass action, at equilibrium, the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal. The dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined as the ratio of the product of the equilibrium concentrations of the dissociated species to the concentration of the complex. Let $[R]$, $[L]$, and $[C]$ be the equilibrium concentrations (or, in this single-cell context, numbers of molecules) of free receptors, free ligand, and complex, respectively.\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[C]}\n$$\nThe total number of receptors, $R_T$, is the sum of free receptors and ligand-bound receptors.\n$$\n[R_T] = [R] + [C]\n$$\nFractional occupancy, $Y$, is defined as the fraction of the total receptors that are in the bound state.\n$$\nY = \\frac{[C]}{[R_T]}\n$$\nOur objective is to express $Y$ as a function of $[L]$ and $K_d$. We rearrange the preceding equations. From the definition of $Y$, we express $[C]$ in terms of $Y$ and $[R_T]$.\n$$\n[C] = Y [R_T]\n$$\nFrom the conservation of receptors, we express $[R]$ in terms of $[C]$ and $[R_T]$, and then in terms of $Y$ and $[R_T]$.\n$$\n[R] = [R_T] - [C] = [R_T] - Y [R_T] = [R_T](1-Y)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $[R]$ and $[C]$ into the definition of $K_d$.\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{([R_T](1-Y)) [L]}{Y [R_T]}\n$$\nThe $[R_T]$ term cancels from the numerator and denominator, which is expected as the fractional occupancy should not depend on the total number of receptors, but only on the ligand concentration and binding affinity.\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{(1-Y)[L]}{Y}\n$$\nWe now solve this equation algebraically for $Y$.\n$$\nY K_d = (1-Y)[L]\n$$\n$$\nY K_d = [L] - Y[L]\n$$\n$$\nY K_d + Y[L] = [L]\n$$\n$$\nY(K_d + [L]) = [L]\n$$\nThis gives the final expression for fractional occupancy, known as the Hill-Langmuir equation for a single binding site.\n$$\nY = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Fractional Occupancies**\n\nWe are given $K_d = 100\\ \\text{pM}$. We will calculate $Y$ for two different ligand concentrations.\n\nCase 1: $[L] = 10\\ \\text{pM}$.\nThe units of $[L]$ and $K_d$ are consistent (pM).\n$$\nY_1 = \\frac{10\\ \\text{pM}}{100\\ \\text{pM} + 10\\ \\text{pM}} = \\frac{10}{110} = \\frac{1}{11}\n$$\n\nCase 2: $[L] = 1\\ \\text{nM}$.\nThe units must be made consistent. We convert nM to pM: $1\\ \\text{nM} = 1000\\ \\text{pM}$.\n$$\nY_2 = \\frac{1000\\ \\text{pM}}{100\\ \\text{pM} + 1000\\ \\text{pM}} = \\frac{1000}{1100} = \\frac{10}{11}\n$$\nThe two fractional occupancies, expressed as exact fractions, are $\\frac{1}{11}$ and $\\frac{10}{11}$.\n\n**Part 3: Interpretation**\n\nThe fractional occupancy $Y$ quantifies the extent of receptor activation at a given ligand concentration. The number of active signaling complexes is given by $N_{bound} = Y \\times R_T$. The relationship $Y = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}$ shows that receptor occupancy is a saturable, hyperbolic function of ligand concentration.\n\nThe dissociation constant $K_d$ represents the ligand concentration at which half of the receptors are occupied ($Y = 0.5$). The calculated values demonstrate the system's sensitivity to ligand concentration relative to its $K_d$.\nAt $[L] = 10\\ \\text{pM} = 0.1 K_d$, a concentration well below the $K_d$, the occupancy is low ($Y = \\frac{1}{11} \\approx 9.1\\%$). This corresponds to approximately $\\frac{1}{11} \\times 10^4 \\approx 909$ bound receptors.\nAt $[L] = 1\\ \\text{nM} = 10 K_d$, a concentration well above the $K_d$, the system is near saturation ($Y = \\frac{10}{11} \\approx 90.9\\%$). This corresponds to approximately $\\frac{10}{11} \\times 10^4 \\approx 9091$ bound receptors.\n\nThis sharp transition in receptor occupancy forms the basis for biological thresholding. Many downstream signaling pathways are not activated linearly with the number of bound receptors. Instead, they require a critical number of signaling complexes to be formed before a robust cellular response is initiated.\nFor instance, if a pathway requires a threshold of $2000$ bound receptors ($Y=0.2$), the lower ligand concentration of $10\\ \\text{pM}$ (yielding ~$909$ receptors) would be sub-threshold, eliciting little to no response. The cell effectively ignores this low-level signal. In contrast, the higher ligand concentration of $1\\ \\text{nM}$ (yielding ~$9091$ receptors) is far above this threshold, triggering a strong, decisive cellular response.\n\nThe hyperbolic (or, in cooperative systems, sigmoidal) nature of the binding curve allows a cell to function as a switch. It remains 'off' in the presence of low, background levels of cytokine but turns decisively 'on' when the concentration rises above a critical range near the $K_d$. This mechanism ensures that cellular responses are specific and robust to physiologically relevant signals, filtering out insignificant noise.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{11} & \\frac{10}{11} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2560604"}, {"introduction": "Once a cytokine is secreted, its influence is not infinite; it is governed by the physics of diffusion and the biology of clearance.

A rigorous solution will be provided.\n\nThe fundamental reaction-diffusion equation for the concentration $C(\\mathbf{r}, t)$ is given by Fick's second law, augmented with a source term and a sink term. In this case, the removal process is a first-order reaction, so the sink term is $-\\beta C$. The source is a point source at the origin.

The equation simplifies to:\n$$\nD \\nabla^{2} C - \\beta C = 0\n$$\nThis is the steady-state reaction-diffusion equation, also known as the Helmholtz equation. We are given the assumption of spherical symmetry, so the concentration $C$ is a function only of the radial distance $r$, i.e., $C = C(r)$. In spherical coordinates, the Laplacian operator $\\nabla^{2}$ acting on a scalar function $C(r)$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla^{2} C(r) = \\frac{1}{r^{2}} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^{2} \\frac{dC}{dr} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the steady-state equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{r^{2}} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^{2} \\frac{dC}{dr} \\right) - \\beta C(r) = 0\n$$\nTo solve this second-order ordinary differential equation, we introduce a substitution. Let $C(r) = \\frac{u(r)}{r}$.

The general solution is of the form $u(r) = A_{1} \\exp(kr) + A_{2} \\exp(-kr)$, where $k^{2} = \\frac{\\beta}{D}$. Thus, $k = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta}{D}}$.

The first term, $\\frac{A_{1}}{r} \\exp\\left(r\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta}{D}}\\right)$, diverges as $r \\to \\infty$ because the exponential growth dominates the algebraic decay of $\\frac{1}{r}$.

This leaves:\n$$\nC(r) = \\frac{A_{2}}{r} \\exp\\left(-r\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta}{D}}\\right)\n$$\nThe constant $A_{2}$ is determined by the source strength $S$. Specifically, the total flux of molecules out of any sphere enclosing the source, plus the total amount degraded within the volume, must equal $S$ at steady state. The flux integral condition gives $A_{2} = \\frac{S}{4\\pi D}$. The final solution for the concentration profile is $C(r) = \\frac{S}{4\\pi D r} \\exp\\left(-r\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta}{D}}\\right)$.\n\nThe form of this solution is a decay term multiplied by $\\frac{1}{r}$. The spatial attenuation is controlled by the exponential factor. This factor is conventionally written as $\\exp(-r/\\lambda)$, where $\\lambda$ is the characteristic decay length scale. By comparing the derived solution with this standard form:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-r\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta}{D}}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\nwe can directly identify:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta}{D}} \\implies \\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{\\beta}}\n$$\nThis is the characteristic decay length.

Paracrine signaling refers to cellular communication over short distances, typically acting on nearby cells in a tissue. Endocrine signaling involves the transport of signaling molecules (hormones) over long distances, usually via the bloodstream, to act on distant target cells. A characteristic length of $\\lambda = 100\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$ ($0.1$ millimeters) is a microscopic distance. It is larger than the diameter of a single cell (typically $10-30\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$) but far too short for systemic communication. This length scale confines the cytokine's effective signaling range to the local tissue microenvironment. Therefore, the magnitude of $\\lambda$ indicates that the signaling is primarily paracrine in nature.
