It is a standard problem in the study of passive membrane properties. We will proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the governing differential equation for the membrane potential $V(t)$ of an isopotential patch of membrane with area $A$. The membrane is modeled as a capacitor in parallel with a resistor. The derivation must start from three fundamental principles.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Charge:** The total applied current, $I_{\\text{app}}(t)$, flowing into the membrane patch must equal the sum of the currents flowing through the parallel pathways: the capacitive current, $I_C(t)$, and the leak ionic current, $I_L(t)$.\n    $$I_{\\text{app}}(t) = I_C(t) + I_L(t)$$\n    The applied current is given as a spatially uniform density, $j_{\\text{app}}(t)$, so the total current is $I_{\\text{app}}(t) = j_{\\text{app}}(t) A$.\n\n2.  **Definition of Capacitance:** The charge $Q(t)$ stored on the membrane capacitance is proportional to the voltage $V(t)$ across it: $Q(t) = C V(t)$, where $C$ is the total capacitance of the patch. The capacitive current is the rate of change of this stored charge.\n    $$I_C(t) = \\frac{dQ}{dt} = C \\frac{dV}{dt}$$\n\n3.  **Ohm's Law for the Leak Pathway:** The leak current $I_L(t)$ is proportional to the electrical driving force across the leak resistance $R$. The problem specifies that the reversal potential for the leak pathway is set to $0$ by choice of reference. Therefore, the driving force is simply the membrane potential $V(t)$.\n    $$I_L(t) = \\frac{V(t)}{R}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $I_C(t)$ and $I_L(t)$ into the charge conservation equation yields:\n$$j_{\\text{app}}(t) A = C \\frac{dV}{dt} + \\frac{V(t)}{R}$$\nThis equation relates total quantities ($C$, $R$) to the membrane potential. The problem requires the result in terms of specific membrane properties: the specific membrane capacitance $C_m$ (capacitance per unit area) and the specific membrane resistance $R_m$ (resistance scaled by area). These are defined as:\n$$C_m = \\frac{C}{A} \\implies C = C_m A$$\n$$R_m = R A \\implies R = \\frac{R_m}{A}$$\nSubstituting these definitions into the governing equation gives:\n$$j_{\\text{app}}(t) A = (C_m A) \\frac{dV}{dt} + \\frac{V(t)}{R_m/A}$$\n$$j_{\\text{app}}(t) A = C_m A \\frac{dV}{dt} + \\frac{V(t) A}{R_m}$$\nDividing all terms by the area $A$, which is non-zero, we obtain the ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $V(t)$ in the desired form:\n$$j_{\\text{app}}(t) = C_m \\frac{dV}{dt} + \\frac{V(t)}{R_m}$$\nThis is the required ODE. It can be rearranged into the standard form for a first-order linear ODE:\n$$C_m R_m \\frac{dV}{dt} + V(t) = j_{\\text{app}}(t) R_m$$\nFor $t \\ge 0$, the applied current density is a constant value, which we denote as $j_0$. The equation becomes:\n$$C_m R_m \\frac{dV}{dt} + V(t) = j_0 R_m$$\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear first-order ODE with constant coefficients. The solution $V(t)$ is the sum of a homogeneous solution $V_h(t)$ and a particular (steady-state) solution $V_p(t)$.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is $C_m R_m \\frac{dV_h}{dt} + V_h(t) = 0$, which has the solution $V_h(t) = K \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_m C_m}\\right)$, where $K$ is an integration constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, we look for the steady-state voltage $V_{ss}$ where the voltage is no longer changing, so $\\frac{dV}{dt} = 0$. The ODE reduces to $V_{ss} = j_0 R_m$.\n\nThe general solution is $V(t) = V_h(t) + V_p(t) = K \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_m C_m}\\right) + j_0 R_m$.\nWe use the initial condition that the membrane is at rest before the current step, so $V(0) = 0$.\n$$V(0) = K \\exp(0) + j_0 R_m = K + j_0 R_m = 0 \\implies K = -j_0 R_m$$\nSubstituting $K$ back into the general solution gives the final solution for the membrane potential:\n$$V(t) = -j_0 R_m \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_m C_m}\\right) + j_0 R_m$$\n$$V(t) = j_0 R_m \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_m C_m}\\right)\\right)$$\nThis equation demonstrates that the membrane potential $V(t)$ approaches its steady-state value $V_{ss} = j_0 R_m$ with a **single-exponential** time course. The time constant of this exponential process, denoted by $\\tau$, is the coefficient in the denominator of the time variable in the exponent.\nBy inspection, the membrane time constant is:\n$$\\tau = R_m C_m$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $\\tau$ using the provided parameters.

The derivation will proceed from the three specified first principles applied to a differential element of the axonal cable.\n\nLet us consider a cylindrical segment of the axon of infinitesimal length $dx$ located at an axial position $x$. The axon has a uniform radius $a$.\n\nFirst, we apply the principle of charge conservation. In a Direct Current (DC) steady state, there can be no net accumulation or depletion of charge within any segment of the axon. This means that the axial current $I_i(x)$ entering the segment at position $x$ must equal the sum of the axial current $I_i(x+dx)$ leaving the segment at position $x+dx$ and the total transmembrane current $dI_m$ leaking out through the membrane surface of the segment.\n$$I_i(x) = I_i(x+dx) + dI_m$$\nRearranging this gives $dI_m = I_i(x) - I_i(x+dx)$. In differential form, this is $dI_m = -dI_i$. If we define $i_m$ as the membrane current per unit length of the axon, then $dI_m = i_m dx$. This yields the first key relation:\n$$i_m = -\\frac{dI_i}{dx}$$\n\nSecond, we apply Ohm's law in differential form for the axial conductor. The intracellular medium is characterized by a uniform resistivity $R_i$. The cross-sectional area for axial current flow is $A = \\pi a^2$. The axial resistance per unit length, denoted $r_i$, is therefore given by:\n$$r_i = \\frac{R_i}{A} = \\frac{R_i}{\\pi a^2}$$\nThe potential drop $dV$ along the infinitesimal length $dx$ is related to the axial current $I_i$ and the resistance of the segment, $r_i dx$. According to Ohm's law, where the negative sign indicates that positive current flows from higher to lower potential:\n$$dV = V(x+dx) - V(x) = -I_i (r_i dx)$$\nTaking the limit as $dx \\to 0$ gives the differential relation between the voltage gradient and the axial current:\n$$\\frac{dV}{dx} = -I_i r_i = -I_i \\frac{R_i}{\\pi a^2}$$\n\nThird, we use the definition of specific membrane resistance, $R_m$. This parameter relates the transmembrane potential, $V(x)$, to the transmembrane current density, $J_m(x)$. Since the extracellular resistance is assumed to be negligible, the extracellular space is isopotential, and we may set its potential to $0$. Thus, $V(x)$ is equivalent to the transmembrane potential difference. For a passive, ohmic membrane:\n$$V(x) = J_m(x) R_m$$\nThe membrane current density is therefore $J_m(x) = \\frac{V(x)}{R_m}$. The total membrane current $dI_m$ leaking from the segment of length $dx$ is this density multiplied by the surface area of the segment, $dA_m = 2 \\pi a dx$.\n$$dI_m = J_m dA_m = \\frac{V(x)}{R_m} (2 \\pi a dx)$$\nFrom this, the membrane current per unit length $i_m = \\frac{dI_m}{dx}$ is:\n$$i_m = \\frac{2 \\pi a}{R_m} V(x)$$\n\nNow, we synthesize these three results to derive the cable equation. From the second principle, we express the axial current $I_i$ in terms of the voltage gradient:\n$$I_i(x) = -\\frac{1}{r_i}\\frac{dV}{dx} = -\\frac{\\pi a^2}{R_i}\\frac{dV}{dx}$$\nWe substitute this expression for $I_i$ into the equation from the first principle:\n$$i_m = -\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( -\\frac{\\pi a^2}{R_i}\\frac{dV}{dx} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi a^2}{R_i}\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2}$$\nFinally, we equate this expression for $i_m$ with the expression from the third principle:\n$$\\frac{\\pi a^2}{R_i}\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = \\frac{2 \\pi a}{R_m} V(x)$$\nRearranging this equation gives the final form of the steady-state cable equation. We divide by $\\pi a$ and move all terms involving $V(x)$ to one side:\n$$\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi a}{R_m} \\right) \\left( \\frac{R_i}{\\pi a^2} \\right) V(x) = \\frac{2 R_i}{a R_m} V(x)$$\nIt is standard to define the length constant, $\\lambda$, as the characteristic length scale of the system, where $\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} = \\frac{2 R_i}{a R_m}$. The equation then becomes:\n$$\\lambda^2 \\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} - V(x) = 0$$\nThis is the required steady-state $1$-dimensional cable equation. The general solution to this $2^{nd}$-order linear homogeneous differential equation is:\n$$V(x) = C_1 \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) + C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nFor a physically meaningful solution in a semi-infinite axon ($x \\ge 0$) where the potential must remain bounded as $x \\to \\infty$, the coefficient of the exponentially growing term, $C_1$, must be set to $0$. The solution thus takes the form of an exponential decay:\n$$V(x) = V_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nwhere $V_0 = V(0)$ is the potential at $x=0$. This confirms that solutions decay exponentially with a characteristic length scale $\\lambda$.
