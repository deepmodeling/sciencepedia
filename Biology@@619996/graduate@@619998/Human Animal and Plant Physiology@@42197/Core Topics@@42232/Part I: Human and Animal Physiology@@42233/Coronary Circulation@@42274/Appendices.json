(The derivative $\\frac{d R_{parallel}}{d R_B} = \\frac{R_A^2}{(R_A + R_B)^2} > 0$, so $R_{parallel}$ is a monotonically increasing function of $R_B$).\n\nThe decrease in $R_{parallel}$ causes the total network resistance $R_{total} = R_0 + R_{parallel}$ to decrease. Consequently, the total flow from the aorta, $Q_{total} = \\frac{P_a - P_v}{R_{total}}$, increases.\n\nNow we examine the effect on the flow in territory $A$, $Q_A$. The flow is given by:\n$$ Q_A = \\frac{P_{bif} - P_v}{R_A} = \\frac{(P_a - Q_{total} R_0) - P_v}{R_A} $$\nSince $Q_{total}$ increases and $R_0 > 0$, the pressure drop across the proximal segment, $Q_{total}R_0$, increases. This leads to a decrease in the pressure at the bifurcation point, $P_{bif}$. Because the resistance of territory $A$, $R_A$, is fixed, and the perfusion pressure across it, $P_{bif} - P_v$, has decreased, the flow through it, $Q_A$, must decrease.\n\nThis phenomenon, where vasodilation in one vascular bed causes a paradoxical reduction of flow in a parallel bed supplied by a common stenosed artery, is termed \"coronary steal.\" It is critically dependent on the presence of a non-zero serial resistance ($R_0 > 0$) proximal to the bifurcation.
