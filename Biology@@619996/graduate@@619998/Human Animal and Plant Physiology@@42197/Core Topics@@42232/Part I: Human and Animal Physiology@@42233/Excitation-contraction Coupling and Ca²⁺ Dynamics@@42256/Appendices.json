The problem states that the midpoint of the force curve, where force is half-maximal, corresponds to the calcium concentration at which the fractional occupancy of the regulatory site on Troponin C, $\\theta$, is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}$.

We set $\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$ in the equation above and solve for the corresponding concentration, which we denote $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}}{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50} + K_{d}}\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by $2 \\cdot ([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50} + K_{d})$ yields:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50} + K_{d} = 2 \\cdot [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}\n$$\nSolving for $K_{d}$ gives the fundamental relationship:\n$$\nK_{d} = [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that, under the given assumptions, the $\\mathrm{EC50}$ is numerically equal to the dissociation constant.\n\nThis relationship holds for both the wild-type (WT) and mutant (mut) forms:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = K_{d}^{\\mathrm{WT}}\n$$\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = K_{d}^{\\mathrm{mut}}\n$$\nThe problem states that the mutation halves the affinity, which corresponds to a doubling of the dissociation constant:\n$$\nK_{d}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = 2 K_{d}^{\\mathrm{WT}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the equations for $\\mathrm{EC50}$ gives:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = 2 \\cdot [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the shift on the $p\\mathrm{Ca}$ axis, where $p\\mathrm{Ca} = -\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}])$. We can write the midpoints $p\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$ and $p\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{mut}}$:\n$$\np\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = -\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}})\n$$\n$$\np\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = -\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}^{\\mathrm{mut}})\n$$\nNow, we substitute the relationship between the mutant and wild-type $\\mathrm{EC50}$ values into the equation for $p\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{mut}}$:\n$$\np\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = -\\log_{10}(2 \\cdot [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}})\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $\\log(ab) = \\log(a) + \\log(b)$, we get:\n$$\np\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = -(\\log_{10}(2) + \\log_{10}([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}}))\n$$\n$$\np\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = -\\log_{10}(2) - \\log_{10}([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}})\n$$\nRecognizing that $-\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}})$ is equal to $p\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$, we have:\n$$\np\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = p\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}} - \\log_{10}(2)\n$$\nThe required shift, $\\Delta p\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}$, is defined as $p\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{mut}} - p\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$.\n$$\n\\Delta p\\mathrm{Ca}_{50} = (p\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}} - \\log_{10}(2)) - p\\mathrm{Ca}_{50}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = -\\log_{10}(2)\n$$\nThis is the first part of the answer. A decrease in calcium affinity (increase in $K_d$) leads to a rightward shift of the force-calcium curve, which corresponds to a decrease on the $p\\mathrm{Ca}$ scale (since $p\\mathrm{Ca}$ is a negative logarithm).\n\nSecond, we determine the mutated Hill coefficient, $n_{H}^{\\mathrm{mut}}$. The problem statement provides a clear separation between the factors determining the curve's position (sensitivity) and its steepness (cooperativity). The macroscopic steepness of the sigmoidal force–$p\\mathrm{Ca}$ curve is quantified by the Hill coefficient, $n_{H}$. The problem states that this steepness is governed by the \"cooperative coupling along the thin filament that is characterized by an effective Hill coefficient $n_{0}$ in the wild type.\" Crucially, it is also stated that \"The mutation considered below does not alter this cooperative coupling architecture (that is, it does not change $n_{0}$).\"\n\nThis implies that the intrinsic cooperativity of the system, which gives rise to the steep sigmoidal response, is an independent parameter that is unaffected by the mutation to the calcium binding site. The Hill coefficient of the force-response curve, $n_H$, is the macroscopic manifestation of this underlying cooperativity, which is parameterized by $n_0$. Therefore, the Hill coefficient for the wild-type is $n_{H}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = n_{0}$. Since the mutation does not affect the cooperative mechanism, the Hill coefficient for the mutant must be the same as for the wild-type.\n$$\nn_{H}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = n_{H}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = n_{0}\n$$\nThe mutation shifts the position of the curve without altering its shape or steepness. Therefore, the mutated Hill coefficient, expressed in terms of the wild-type value $n_0$, is simply $n_0$.\n\nCombining the results, the additive shift in the midpoint is $-\\log_{10}(2)$ and the mutated Hill coefficient is $n_0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -\\log_{10}(2) & n_{0} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2567167"}, {"introduction": "The process of calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) relies on the precise choreography of Ca²⁺ ions within the nanoscopic dyadic cleft.

Assume that across the cleft thickness, calcium rapidly attains a quasi-uniform concentration due to diffusion, so that on the timescale of the local peak, the free calcium concentration is governed primarily by conservation of mass in the effective volume $V = A w$ and is linearly reduced by a constant buffer capacity factor $\\beta$ that is unchanged between conditions.\n\nAt baseline width $w_{0}$, the measured local peak free calcium concentration at the ryanodine receptor (RyR) mouth is $c_{0} = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.

This quantity is constant. The geometry of the cleft is a slab with constant apposed area $A$ and variable width $w$. The volume of this cleft is $V = A w$.\n\nUpon injection, these calcium ions are distributed throughout the volume $V$. The total concentration of added calcium, $C_{\\text{total}}$, is given by the ratio of the moles of calcium to the volume:\n$$C_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{Ca}}}{V} = \\frac{n_{\\text{Ca}}}{A w}$$\nThe problem states that the free calcium concentration, $c$, is linearly reduced by a constant buffer capacity factor $\\beta$. This implies that the free concentration is directly proportional to the total concentration of added calcium. The constant of proportionality, which we will call $k$, depends on the unchanged buffering properties of the system.\n$$c = k \\cdot C_{\\text{total}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{\\text{total}}$, we obtain the relationship between the free calcium concentration $c$ and the cleft width $w$:\n$$c = k \\frac{n_{\\text{Ca}}}{A w}$$\nThe quantities $k$, $n_{\\text{Ca}}$, and $A$ are all constant between the baseline and pathological conditions. We can therefore group them into a single constant, $K = k n_{\\text{Ca}} / A$, which gives the simplified relationship:\n$$c = \\frac{K}{w}$$\nThis shows that the peak free calcium concentration is inversely proportional to the cleft width.\n\nWe can now write this relationship for the baseline state (subscript $0$) and the pathologically remodeled state (subscript $1$):\n$$c_{0} = \\frac{K}{w_{0}}$$\n$$c_{1} = \\frac{K}{w_{1}}$$\nThe fold-change in concentration is the ratio $c_{1}/c_{0}$:\n$$\\frac{c_{1}}{c_{0}} = \\frac{K/w_{1}}{K/w_{0}} = \\frac{w_{0}}{w_{1}}$$\nThe problem states that the cleft width increases by $20\\%$, meaning $w_{1} = w_{0} + 0.2 w_{0} = 1.2 w_{0}$.

The open probability, $P_{\\text{open}}$, is the probability that both sites are occupied. If $P_{\\text{site}}$ is the probability that a single site is occupied, the independence of the sites implies:\n$$P_{\\text{open}} = (P_{\\text{site}})^{2}$$\nThe probability $P_{\\text{site}}$ is determined by the law of mass action for the binding equilibrium: $\\text{Site} + \\text{Ca}^{2+} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Site-Ca}^{2+}$. The equilibrium dissociation constant is given as $K_{d}$. The probability of a site being occupied by calcium (concentration $c$) is given by the standard fractional occupancy formula (a Hill equation with coefficient $1$):\n$$P_{\\text{site}} = \\frac{c}{c + K_{d}}$$\nTherefore, the RyR open probability as a function of free calcium concentration is:\n$$P_{\\text{open}}(c) = \\left(\\frac{c}{c + K_{d}}\\right)^{2}$$\nWe are given the baseline concentration $c_{0} = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and the dissociation constant $K_{d} = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.
