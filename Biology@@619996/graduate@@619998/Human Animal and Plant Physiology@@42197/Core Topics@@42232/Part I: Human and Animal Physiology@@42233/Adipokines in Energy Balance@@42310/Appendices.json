The adipokine can act locally (paracrine) within each depot via receptor-mediated internalization and systemically (endocrine) after entering the plasma.

It is well-posed, with sufficient information provided to determine a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. While the problem statement does not provide the interstitial volumes of the adipose depots, these volumes are not necessary for the calculation, as will be demonstrated. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds from the fundamental principle of mass conservation at steady state.\n\nFirst, we analyze a single adipose depot $i$. Let $A_i(t)$ be the amount of adipokine in the interstitial fluid of depot $i$ at time $t$. The rate of change of this amount is given by the balance of secretion and removal:\n$$ \\frac{dA_i}{dt} = Q_i - (\\text{Rate of endocrine export}) - (\\text{Rate of paracrine internalization}) $$\nThe removal processes are described as first-order. A first-order rate process is proportional to the total amount of the substance. Thus, the rate of endocrine export is $k_{e,i} A_i$ and the rate of paracrine internalization is $k_{p,i} A_i$. The mass balance equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dA_i}{dt} = Q_i - k_{e,i}A_i - k_{p,i}A_i = Q_i - (k_{e,i} + k_{p,i})A_i $$\nAt steady state, $\\frac{dA_i}{dt} = 0$. This implies:\n$$ Q_i = (k_{e,i} + k_{p,i})A_{i,ss} $$\nwhere $A_{i,ss}$ is the steady-state amount of adipokine in the interstitium of depot $i$.\nSolving for $A_{i,ss}$ yields:\n$$ A_{i,ss} = \\frac{Q_i}{k_{e,i} + k_{p,i}} $$\nThe rate of adipokine entry into the plasma from depot $i$, which we denote as the flux $J_{i \\to p}$, is the endocrine export rate at steady state:\n$$ J_{i \\to p} = k_{e,i} A_{i,ss} = k_{e,i} \\left( \\frac{Q_i}{k_{e,i} + k_{p,i}} \\right) = Q_i \\frac{k_{e,i}}{k_{e,i} + k_{p,i}} $$\nNotice that this expression for the flux into plasma does not depend on the unknown interstitial volume of the depot.\n\nNext, we analyze the plasma compartment. Let $A_p(t)$ be the amount of adipokine in the plasma at time $t$. The mass balance equation for the plasma is:\n$$ \\frac{dA_p}{dt} = (\\text{Total rate of entry}) - (\\text{Rate of systemic clearance}) $$\nThe total rate of entry is the sum of fluxes from both the visceral and subcutaneous depots, $J_{\\text{vis} \\to p} + J_{\\text{sub} \\to p}$. The rate of systemic clearance is a first-order process with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{cl}}$, so the rate is $k_{\\mathrm{cl}} A_p$.\n$$ \\frac{dA_p}{dt} = (J_{\\text{vis} \\to p} + J_{\\text{sub} \\to p}) - k_{\\mathrm{cl}}A_p $$\nAt steady state, $\\frac{dA_p}{dt} = 0$, which gives:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{cl}}A_{p,ss} = J_{\\text{vis} \\to p} + J_{\\text{sub} \\to p} $$\nwhere $A_{p,ss}$ is the steady-state amount of adipokine in the plasma. The steady-state plasma concentration is $C_{p,ss} = A_{p,ss} / V_p$. Substituting $A_{p,ss} = C_{p,ss} V_p$ into the equation:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{cl}} C_{p,ss} V_p = J_{\\text{vis} \\to p} + J_{\\text{sub} \\to p} $$\nSolving for $C_{p,ss}$:\n$$ C_{p,ss} = \\frac{J_{\\text{vis} \\to p} + J_{\\text{sub} \\to p}}{k_{\\mathrm{cl}} V_p} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the individual fluxes:\n$$ C_{p,ss} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{cl}} V_p} \\left( Q_{\\text{vis}} \\frac{k_{e,\\text{vis}}}{k_{e,\\text{vis}} + k_{p,\\text{vis}}} + Q_{\\text{sub}} \\frac{k_{e,\\text{sub}}}{k_{e,\\text{sub}} + k_{p,\\text{sub}}} \\right) $$\nThis is the general symbolic solution. Now, we substitute the provided numerical values.\n\nThe flux from the visceral depot is:\n$$ J_{\\text{vis} \\to p} = (80 \\text{ pmol min}^{-1}) \\frac{0.20 \\text{ min}^{-1}}{0.20 \\text{ min}^{-1} + 0.60 \\text{ min}^{-1}} = (80) \\frac{0.20}{0.80} \\text{ pmol min}^{-1} = 20 \\text{ pmol min}^{-1} $$\nThe flux from the subcutaneous depot is:\n$$ J_{\\text{sub} \\to p} = (40 \\text{ pmol min}^{-1}) \\frac{0.10 \\text{ min}^{-1}}{0.10 \\text{ min}^{-1} + 0.10 \\text{ min}^{-1}} = (40) \\frac{0.10}{0.20} \\text{ pmol min}^{-1} = 20 \\text{ pmol min}^{-1} $$\nThe total flux into the plasma is:\n$$ J_{\\text{total}} = J_{\\text{vis} \\to p} + J_{\\text{sub} \\to p} = 20 \\text{ pmol min}^{-1} + 20 \\text{ pmol min}^{-1} = 40 \\text{ pmol min}^{-1} $$\nThe systemic clearance term in volume per time is $k_{\\mathrm{cl}} V_p$:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{cl}} V_p = (0.010 \\text{ min}^{-1}) \\times (3 \\text{ L}) = 0.030 \\text{ L min}^{-1} $$\nNow we compute the steady-state plasma concentration:\n$$ C_{p,ss} = \\frac{J_{\\text{total}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cl}} V_p} = \\frac{40 \\text{ pmol min}^{-1}}{0.030 \\text{ L min}^{-1}} = \\frac{4000}{3} \\text{ pmol L}^{-1} \\approx 1333.33 \\text{ pmol L}^{-1} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in nanomolar (nM).
