Baseline presynaptic calcium current is $I_{\\mathrm{Ca}}(t)$.\n2.  The probability of vesicle release per action potential, $P_{rel}$, is determined by the time integral of an instantaneous fusion rate, $R(t)$.\n3.  The number of calcium ions is proportional to the time integral of $I_{\\mathrm{Ca}}(t)$.\n4.  Local free calcium concentration, $[\\mathrm{Ca}](t)$, scales approximately linearly with the amplitude of $I_{\\mathrm{Ca}}(t)$, while the shape of the waveform is preserved.\n5.  The instantaneous fusion rate, $R(t)$, is proportional to $[\\mathrm{Ca}](t)^{n}$ with $n=4$.\n6.  A calcium channel blocker reduces the amplitude of $I_{\\mathrm{Ca}}(t)$ by $30$ percent without altering its time course.\n7.  The goal is to find the fractional reduction in $P_{rel}$, defined as $1 - \\frac{P_{rel, new}}{P_{rel, base}}$.\n8.  The final answer must be a unitless decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n\nNext, these givens are validated. The problem describes a simplified but standard biophysical model of neurotransmitter release, a cornerstone of quantitative neuroscience. The Dodge-Rahamimoff model of release, where release probability is a power function of calcium concentration with a cooperativity of $n \\approx 4-5$, is a well-established empirical finding. The assumptions of linear scaling between calcium current amplitude and local calcium concentration are common and valid approximations in modeling synaptic microdomains over short time scales. The problem is self-contained, scientifically grounded in established principles of cellular neurophysiology, and posed with sufficient clarity and data to permit a unique solution. It does not violate any criteria for scientific or logical validity. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a formal solution can be constructed.\n\nLet $P_{rel}$ denote the probability of vesicle release. According to the problem, $P_{rel}$ is determined by the time integral of the instantaneous fusion rate, $R(t)$. For low probabilities of release, this relationship can be taken as a direct proportionality.\n$$P_{rel} \\propto \\int R(t) \\, dt$$\nThe integration is performed over the time course of the calcium transient.\n\nThe instantaneous fusion rate $R(t)$ is given to be proportional to the $n$-th power of the local free calcium concentration, $[\\mathrm{Ca}](t)$, with a cooperativity of $n=4$.\n$$R(t) \\propto [\\mathrm{Ca}](t)^{n} = [\\mathrm{Ca}](t)^{4}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $P_{rel}$:\n$$P_{rel} \\propto \\int [\\mathrm{Ca}](t)^{4} \\, dt$$\n\nThe problem states that the calcium concentration waveform $[\\mathrm{Ca}](t)$ scales linearly with the amplitude of the calcium current $I_{\\mathrm{Ca}}(t)$, and its time course is preserved. Let the amplitude of the calcium current be $A_{I}$ and its normalized time course be $f(t)$, such that $I_{\\mathrm{Ca}}(t) = A_I f(t)$. The preservation of the calcium waveform shape under amplitude scaling of the current implies that we can write the calcium concentration as $[\\mathrm{Ca}](t) = A_{Ca} g(t)$, where $g(t)$ is the normalized time course of the calcium concentration, and its amplitude $A_{Ca}$ is proportional to the current amplitude $A_I$.\n$$A_{Ca} \\propto A_I$$\nThus, we can write $A_{Ca} = k A_I$ for some proportionality constant $k$. The calcium concentration is then $[\\mathrm{Ca}](t) = k A_I g(t)$.\n\nWe can now express the release probability in terms of the current amplitude $A_I$.\n$$P_{rel} \\propto \\int (k A_I g(t))^{4} \\, dt$$\n$$P_{rel} \\propto (k A_I)^{4} \\int g(t)^{4} \\, dt$$\nSince $k$ is a constant and the integral $\\int g(t)^{4} \\, dt$ depends only on the shape of the calcium transient, which is preserved, the entire term $k^{4} \\int g(t)^{4} \\, dt$ is a constant of proportionality. Let this constant be $\\beta$.\n$$P_{rel} = \\beta (A_I)^{4}$$\nThis equation formally establishes the relationship between release probability and calcium current amplitude.\n\nWe now analyze the two conditions: baseline and post-blocker.\nLet $A_{I, base}$ be the baseline amplitude of the calcium current and $P_{rel, base}$ be the corresponding baseline release probability.\n$$P_{rel, base} = \\beta (A_{I, base})^{4}$$\n\nA calcium channel blocker is applied, reducing the amplitude of $I_{\\mathrm{Ca}}(t)$ by $30\\%$. The new current amplitude, $A_{I, new}$, is:\n$$A_{I, new} = A_{I, base} \\cdot (1 - 0.30) = 0.70 \\cdot A_{I, base}$$\nThe new release probability, $P_{rel, new}$, is:\n$$P_{rel, new} = \\beta (A_{I, new})^{4} = \\beta (0.70 \\cdot A_{I, base})^{4}$$\n$$P_{rel, new} = \\beta \\cdot (0.70)^{4} \\cdot (A_{I, base})^{4}$$\nBy substituting $P_{rel, base} = \\beta (A_{I, base})^{4}$, we find the relationship between the new and baseline probabilities:\n$$P_{rel, new} = (0.70)^{4} \\cdot P_{rel, base}$$\n\nThe ratio of the new release probability to the baseline is:\n$$\\frac{P_{rel, new}}{P_{rel, base}} = (0.70)^{4}$$\nCalculating this value:\n$$(0.70)^{4} = (0.70 \\times 0.70) \\times (0.70 \\times 0.70) = 0.49 \\times 0.49 = 0.2401$$\n\nThe problem asks for the fractional reduction in the vesicle release probability, which is defined as $1 - \\frac{P_{rel, new}}{P_{rel, base}}$.\n$$\\text{Fractional Reduction} = 1 - \\frac{P_{rel, new}}{P_{rel, base}} = 1 - (0.70)^{4}$$\n$$\\text{Fractional Reduction} = 1 - 0.2401 = 0.7599$$\nThe result $0.7599$ is a unitless decimal with four significant figures, as required.
