Consider a minimal single-compartment Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) pulse generator for Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH), with membrane potential governed between events by the ordinary differential equation (ODE) $dV/dt = I - \\alpha V$. The threshold-reset dynamics are: when $V$ reaches a threshold $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$, a GnRH pulse is emitted instantaneously, and $V$ is reset to $V_{\\mathrm{reset}}$ followed by an absolute refractory interval of duration $t_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ during which $V$ is held at $V_{\\mathrm{reset}}$. Assume constant input drive $I$ and constant leak $\\alpha$ over the simulated interval. Assume that progesterone increases $\\alpha$ by increasing effective membrane conductance, which, in this model, modulates the inter-pulse interval.\n\nDownstream, model LH secretion as an impulsive input with first-order clearance. Each GnRH pulse causes an instantaneous increment $B$ in LH concentration $L$ (in arbitrary concentration units), while between pulses $L$ follows first-order clearance $dL/dt = -k L$, where $k$ is a positive constant. Assume that $B$ and $k$ are constant and independent of frequency, and that the system reaches a periodic steady state under constant $I$ and $\\alpha$.\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions and laws that are standard in biophysics and physiology, you must derive the algorithm needed to compute the GnRH pulse frequency and the corresponding steady-state mean LH concentration for each parameter set below.

The derivation must proceed from the provided differential equations and event rules.\n\nFirst, we analyze the GnRH pulse generator, modeled as a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron. The membrane potential, $V$, is governed by the ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = I - \\alpha V\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the constant input drive and $\\alpha$ is the leak parameter. A pulse is generated when $V$ reaches the threshold $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$, at which point $V$ is reset to $V_{\\mathrm{reset}}$ and held there for a refractory period $t_{\\mathrm{ref}}$.\n\nA necessary condition for sustained spiking is that the steady-state potential, $V_{\\infty}$, must be greater than the threshold $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$. The steady state is found by setting $dV/dt = 0$:\n$$\nI - \\alpha V_{\\infty} = 0 \\implies V_{\\infty} = \\frac{I}{\\alpha}\n$$\nThus, the system will only produce pulses if $I/\\alpha > V_{\\mathrm{th}}$. If $I/\\alpha \\le V_{\\mathrm{th}}$, the potential $V$ can never reach $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$ from $V_{\\mathrm{reset}}$ (assuming $V_{\\mathrm{reset}}  V_{\\mathrm{th}}$). In this non-spiking regime, the frequency $f$ is zero, and consequently, there is no LH secretion, so the mean concentration $\\overline{L}$ is also zero.\n\nFor the spiking case ($I/\\alpha > V_{\\mathrm{th}}$), we must determine the time, $t_{\\mathrm{rise}}$, for the potential to increase from $V_{\\mathrm{reset}}$ to $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$. We solve the ODE for $V(t)$ with the initial condition $V(0) = V_{\\mathrm{reset}}$. The equation is a first-order linear ODE, which can be solved by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{I - \\alpha V} = dt\n$$\nIntegrating from $t=0$ to $t=t_{\\mathrm{rise}}$, where the potential goes from $V(0)=V_{\\mathrm{reset}}$ to $V(t_{\\mathrm{rise}})=V_{\\mathrm{th}}$:\n$$\n\\int_{V_{\\mathrm{reset}}}^{V_{\\mathrm{th}}} \\frac{dV}{I - \\alpha V} = \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{rise}}} dt\n$$\nThe left integral evaluates to:\n$$\n\\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\ln(I - \\alpha V) \\right]_{V_{\\mathrm{reset}}}^{V_{\\mathrm{th}}} = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( \\ln(I - \\alpha V_{\\mathrm{th}}) - \\ln(I - \\alpha V_{\\mathrm{reset}}) \\right) = t_{\\mathrm{rise}}\n$$\nNote that since $I/\\alpha > V_{\\mathrm{th}}$ and it is given that $V_{\\mathrm{th}} > V_{\\mathrm{reset}}$, the arguments of the logarithms are positive. Rearranging gives the expression for $t_{\\mathrm{rise}}$:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{rise}} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\ln\\left(\\frac{I - \\alpha V_{\\mathrm{reset}}}{I - \\alpha V_{\\mathrm{th}}}\\right)\n$$\nThe total period of one cycle, $T$, is the sum of the rise time and the absolute refractory period:\n$$\nT = t_{\\mathrm{rise}} + t_{\\mathrm{ref}}\n$$\nThe GnRH pulse frequency, $f$, is the reciprocal of the period:\n$$\nf = \\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{1}{t_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\ln\\left(\\frac{I - \\alpha V_{\\mathrm{reset}}}{I - \\alpha V_{\\mathrm{th}}}\\right)}\n$$\n\nNext, we analyze the downstream effect on LH concentration, $L$. Each GnRH pulse causes an instantaneous increase of $B$ in $L$. Between pulses, $L$ decays according to first-order kinetics:\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{dt} = -k L\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the clearance rate constant. In a periodic steady state with period $T$, the system dynamics repeat every cycle. Let us apply a mass balance argument over one cycle. The total amount of LH added to the system in one cycle is $B$. The total amount cleared from the system in one cycle is $\\int_{0}^{T} k L(t) dt$. In steady state, the amount added must equal the amount cleared:\n$$\nB = \\int_{0}^{T} k L(t) dt = k \\int_{0}^{T} L(t) dt\n$$\nThe definition of the mean concentration $\\overline{L}$ over one period is:\n$$\n\\overline{L} = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} L(t) dt\n$$\nSubstituting this into the mass balance equation:\n$$\nB = k (\\overline{L} T)\n$$\nSolving for $\\overline{L}$ gives a simple, direct relationship:\n$$\n\\overline{L} = \\frac{B}{kT}\n$$\nSince frequency $f = 1/T$, we can express the mean LH concentration as a function of GnRH pulse frequency:\n$$\n\\overline{L} = \\frac{Bf}{k}\n$$\nIf there are no GnRH pulses ($f=0$), then no LH is secreted, and the steady-state mean concentration $\\overline{L}$ is correctly predicted to be $0$.\n\nIn summary, the algorithm is as follows for a given set of parameters. First, check the spiking condition:\n1. If $\\alpha \\ge I/V_{\\mathrm{th}}$, the system does not spike. Set $f = 0$ and $\\overline{L} = 0$.\n2. If $\\alpha  I/V_{\\mathrm{th}}$, the system spikes.

This simplifies the denominators of the Michaelis-Menten terms:\n- $K_T + [C] \\approx K_T$\n- $K_G + [A] \\approx K_G$\nThe rate laws under these approximations become linear with respect to substrate:\n- $v_T \\approx \\dfrac{\\nu_T\\,[LH]\\,[C]}{K_T}$\n- $v_G \\approx \\dfrac{\\nu_G\\,[FSH]\\,[A]}{K_G}$\nSubstituting these simplified first-order rate laws into the QSS equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\nu_T\\,[LH]\\,[C]}{K_T} \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\nu_G\\,[FSH]}{K_G}\\right)[A] + k_d[A] $$\nWe now solve for the steady-state concentration of the androgen intermediate, $[A]_{ss}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\nu_T\\,[LH]\\,[C]}{K_T} \\approx [A]_{ss} \\left( \\frac{\\nu_G\\,[FSH]}{K_G} + k_d \\right) $$\n$$ [A]_{ss} \\approx \\frac{\\frac{\\nu_T\\,[LH]\\,[C]}{K_T}}{\\frac{\\nu_G\\,[FSH]}{K_G} + k_d} $$\nThe rate of estradiol production, $v_{E_2}$, is the rate of the granulosa cell reaction, $v_G$. Using the low-substrate approximation for $v_G$:\n$$ v_{E_2} = v_G \\approx \\frac{\\nu_G\\,[FSH]}{K_G} [A]_{ss} $$\nWe substitute the expression for $[A]_{ss}$ into the equation for $v_{E_2}$:\n$$ v_{E_2} \\approx \\frac{\\nu_G\\,[FSH]}{K_G} \\left( \\frac{\\frac{\\nu_T\\,[LH]\\,[C]}{K_T}}{\\frac{\\nu_G\\,[FSH]}{K_G} + k_d} \\right) $$\n$$ v_{E_2} \\approx \\frac{\\nu_T \\nu_G}{K_T K_G} \\frac{[LH]\\,[FSH]\\,[C]}{\\frac{\\nu_G\\,[FSH]}{K_G} + k_d} $$\nThe final step is to apply the asymptotic limit specified in the problem: the aromatase throughput is small compared to the intermediate loss, i.e., $\\left(\\frac{\\nu_G}{K_G}\\right)[FSH] \\ll k_d$. This allows for the simplification of the denominator:\n$$ \\frac{\\nu_G\\,[FSH]}{K_G} + k_d \\approx k_d $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $v_{E_2}$ yields the leading-order dependence:\n$$ v_{E_2} \\approx \\frac{\\nu_T \\nu_G}{K_T K_G} \\frac{[LH]\\,[FSH]\\,[C]}{k_d} $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ v_{E_2} \\approx \\left( \\frac{\\nu_T \\nu_G}{K_T K_G k_d} \\right) [LH]\\,[FSH]\\,[C] $$\nBy comparing this to the target relation $v_{E_2} \\approx k \\,[LH]\\,[FSH]\\,[C]$, we identify the proportionality constant $k$:\n$$ k = \\frac{\\nu_T \\nu_G}{K_T K_G k_d} $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $k$ using the provided parameters:\n- $\\nu_T = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$\n- $\\nu_G = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$\n- $K_T = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $K_G = 1.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $k_d = 0.050\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$\n\n$$ k = \\frac{(0.5\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1})(0.2\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1})}{(20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})(1.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})(0.050\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1})} $$\nThe numerator is $0.5 \\times 0.2 = 0.1$. The units are $(\\mathrm{min}^{-1})^2$.\nThe denominator is $20 \\times 1.0 \\times 0.050 = 1.0$.
