It poses a standard, non-trivial question in biophysical chemistry. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided facts and definitions.\n\n1.  **The Bohr and Haldane Effects**: These two effects are macroscopic manifestations of the thermodynamic linkage between oxygen binding and proton binding. The relationship can be expressed via the Wyman linkage equation. For the purpose of this problem, it is sufficient to understand their mechanistic origin. The alkaline Bohr effect, which dominates in physiological conditions, describes the release of protons upon oxygenation. These protons originate from specific \"Bohr groups\"—amino acid residues whose acid dissociation constants ($\\text{p}K_a$) are lower in the oxygenated (R, high-affinity) state than in the deoxygenated (T, low-affinity) state. The overall Bohr effect is the sum of contributions from all such groups.\n    A negative Bohr factor, $\\phi  0$, means that as $\\mathrm{pH}$ decreases (acidity increases), $\\log_{10}(P_{50})$ increases, which means $P_{50}$ increases and oxygen affinity decreases. This is the hallmark of the physiological Bohr effect.\n    The Haldane effect is the stoichiometric consequence of this $\\text{p}K_a$ shift: oxygen binding drives proton release. The Haldane coefficient, $H$, quantifies this release per heme.\n\n2.  **Role of His146β**: As stated, His146β is a crucial Bohr group. In the T state, its imidazole side chain is protonated and forms a salt bridge with the carboxylate of Asp94β. This electrostatic interaction is a key stabilizer of the T state. The formation of this salt bridge substantially increases the $\\text{p}K_a$ of the His146β imidazole group, to a value near $8.0$. Upon transition to the R state, this salt bridge is broken, and the $\\text{p}K_a$ of His146β drops to a value near the physiological $\\mathrm{pH}$, around $6.5-7.0$.\n\n3.  **Consequences of the His146β $\\to$ Ala Mutation**:\n    *   **Impact on the Bohr Factor ($\\phi$)**: The Bohr effect's magnitude depends on the number of Bohr groups and the magnitude of their $\\Delta \\text{p}K_a$ (i.e., $\\text{p}K_{a,T} - \\text{p}K_{a,R}$). His146β is responsible for a significant fraction (empirically, about $40\\%$) of the alkaline Bohr effect because its $\\Delta \\text{p}K_a$ is large. The mutation to Alanine, whose side chain is a non-titratable methyl group, completely eliminates this residue's contribution. By removing a major contributor to the pH-dependent stabilization of the T state, the overall sensitivity of oxygen affinity to $\\mathrm{pH}$ is reduced. A reduction in the strength of the Bohr effect means the magnitude of the negative Bohr factor, $|\\phi|$, will decrease. Therefore, $\\phi$ becomes *less negative* (i.e., closer to $0$).\n\n    *   **Impact on the Haldane Coefficient ($H$)**: The number of protons released upon oxygenation, $\\Delta n_{\\mathrm{H}^+}$, is the sum of protons released from all Bohr groups.\n    $$ \\Delta n_{\\mathrm{H}^+} = \\sum_{i} \\left( Z_{i,T} - Z_{i,R} \\right) $$\n    where $Z_{i,T}$ and $Z_{i,R}$ are the average charges of group $i$ in the T and R states, respectively. At a physiological $\\mathrm{pH}$ of $7.4$, His146β is substantially protonated in the T state ($\\text{p}K_a \\approx 8.0$) but mostly deprotonated in the R state ($\\text{p}K_a \\approx 6.5-7.0$). Thus, it releases close to one proton per chain upon oxygenation. Since there are two β-chains in the hemoglobin tetramer, replacing both His146β residues removes the source of approximately two of the protons released upon full oxygenation. This directly and substantially reduces the total proton release, $\\Delta n_{\\mathrm{H}^+}$. Consequently, the Haldane coefficient, $H = \\Delta n_{\\mathrm{H}^+}/4$, must decrease.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation**: The His146β $\\to$ Ala mutation eliminates a key Bohr group. This simultaneously reduces the pH sensitivity of oxygen binding (making $\\phi$ less negative) and reduces the total number of protons released upon oxygenation (decreasing $H$).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. $\\phi$ becomes less negative (its magnitude decreases) and $H$ decreases; removing His146β eliminates a T-state-stabilized Bohr proton that would otherwise deprotonate upon oxygenation, reducing both the pH sensitivity of $P_{50}$ and the proton release coupled to oxygenation.**\n    The prediction that $\\phi$ becomes less negative and $H$ decreases is consistent with our derivation. The mechanistic explanation is also correct: the mutation removes a key proton-binding site that is stabilized in the T-state and releases its proton upon oxygenation. This loss directly leads to a reduction in both the pH sensitivity of oxygen affinity and the overall proton release.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. $\\phi$ becomes more negative (its magnitude increases) while $H$ decreases; destabilizing the T state amplifies the pH dependence of $P_{50}$, but fewer titratable sites still reduce proton release.**\n    The prediction for $H$ is correct, but the prediction for $\\phi$ is incorrect. The argument that destabilizing the T state \"amplifies\" the pH dependence is mechanistically flawed. The pH dependence arises from the differential protonation of the T and R states. Removing a major group that contributes to this differential effect must reduce, not amplify, the pH dependence.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. $\\phi$ becomes less negative (its magnitude decreases) while $H$ increases; loss of a protonatable residue decreases pH sensitivity but, because fewer protons are bound, oxygenation drives greater proton release per heme.**\n    The prediction for $\\phi$ is correct, but the prediction for $H$ is incorrect. The reasoning \"because fewer protons are bound, oxygenation drives greater proton release\" is illogical. If a major source of releasable protons is removed, the total number of protons released must decrease, not increase.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. $\\phi$ and $H$ are unchanged; other Bohr groups fully compensate for the missing histidine, leaving both pH sensitivity of oxygen affinity and proton release unaffected.**\n    This option is implausible. His146β is a major contributor to the Bohr and Haldane effects. There is no known mechanism for a perfect, instantaneous \"compensation\" by other residues. Experimental evidence on this and similar mutants shows a significant reduction in these effects.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. $\\phi$ changes sign (becomes positive) while $H$ decreases; removal of His146β reverses the Bohr effect because the remaining groups now favor proton uptake upon oxygenation, but fewer protons are released overall.**\n    While some Bohr groups may contribute a \"reverse\" effect (proton uptake upon oxygenation), the dominant contributions, even after removal of His146β (e.g., from the α-chain N-termini), still favor proton release. Removing the largest single contribution to the negative $\\phi$ makes $\\phi$ less negative, but it is extremely unlikely to make the overall sum positive. A complete reversal of the Bohr effect is not expected.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2613301"}]}
