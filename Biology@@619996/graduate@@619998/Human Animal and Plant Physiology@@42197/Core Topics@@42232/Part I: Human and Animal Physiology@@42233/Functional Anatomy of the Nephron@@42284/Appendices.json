All provided physiological parameters ($P_{GC}$, $P_{BS}$, $\\pi_{GC}$) are within accepted textbook ranges for a human nephron. The value for $K_f$ is a typical value for the entire renal system of an adult, not a single nephron. This suggests the problem intends for the calculation of total GFR for both kidneys, which is a common pedagogical approach.

The units are dimensionally correct: $(\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}^{-1}) \\times (\\mathrm{mmHg}) = \\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, which is the correct unit for a volumetric flow rate.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe foundational principle for fluid flux across the glomerular capillaries is the Starling equation. This principle states that the net fluid flux, in this context the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), is proportional to the net filtration pressure ($P_{uf}$) across the capillary wall. The proportionality constant is the hydraulic filtration coefficient ($K_f$), which consolidates the intrinsic permeability of the filtration barrier and the total surface area available for filtration.\n\nThe GFR is therefore expressed as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{GFR} = K_f \\times P_{uf}\n$$\n\nThe net filtration pressure, $P_{uf}$, is the algebraic sum of the hydrostatic pressures ($\\Delta P$) and colloid osmotic (oncotic) pressures ($\\Delta \\pi$) acting across the membrane. The hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillary ($P_{GC}$) promotes filtration, while the hydrostatic pressure in Bowman's space ($P_{BS}$) opposes it. The colloid osmotic pressure in the glomerular capillary ($\\pi_{GC}$), due to plasma proteins, opposes filtration, while the colloid osmotic pressure in Bowman's space ($\\pi_{BS}$) would promote it. The effectiveness of the osmotic pressure gradient is modulated by the protein reflection coefficient, $\\sigma$.\n\nThe general expression for net filtration pressure is:\n$$\nP_{uf} = \\Delta P - \\sigma \\Delta \\pi = (P_{GC} - P_{BS}) - \\sigma (\\pi_{GC} - \\pi_{BS})\n$$\nThe problem states that proteins are \"effectively reflected,\" which implies that the filtration barrier is impermeable to proteins. This corresponds to a reflection coefficient $\\sigma = 1$. The expression for $P_{uf}$ simplifies to:\n$$\nP_{uf} = (P_{GC} - P_{BS}) - (\\pi_{GC} - \\pi_{BS})\n$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for GFR yields the required general expression:\n$$\n\\mathrm{GFR} = K_f [(P_{GC} - P_{BS}) - (\\pi_{GC} - \\pi_{BS})]\n$$\nThis is the formal derivation from the stated first principles.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of the GFR using the provided data. It is given that the colloid osmotic pressure in Bowman's space, $\\pi_{BS}$, is negligible and can be taken as $0$. This is physiologically correct as the glomerular filtration barrier almost completely prevents plasma proteins like albumin from entering the filtrate.\n\nThe expression for net filtration pressure becomes:\n$$\nP_{uf} = P_{GC} - P_{BS} - \\pi_{GC}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nP_{uf} = 50\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} - 12\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} - 25\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} = 13\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the GFR:\n$$\n\\mathrm{GFR} = K_f \\times P_{uf} = (10\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}^{-1}) \\times (13\\,\\mathrm{mmHg})\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{GFR} = 130\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding to three significant figures. The result, $130$, is presented as such.\n\nFinally, we must comment on the physiological plausibility of this result. The computed GFR of $130\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$ (which corresponds to $187.2$ liters per day) is physiologically plausible. The normal range for total GFR for both kidneys in a healthy young adult is approximately $90$ to $125\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, with values up to $130\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$ being quite common. The calculated value sits at the upper end of this normal range, and is entirely reasonable.\n\nThis high rate of filtration is a direct consequence of the unique functional anatomy of the glomerular filtration barrier, which results in a very high filtration coefficient ($K_f$) for the kidneys as a whole. The key features are:\n1.  **Large Filtration Surface Area**: The total capillary surface area across all glomeruli in both human kidneys is substantial, on the order of $0.5$ to $1.0$ square meters.\n2.  **High Hydraulic Permeability**: The filtration barrier is exceptionally permeable to water and small solutes, being about $50$ times more permeable than a typical systemic capillary. This high permeability arises from its three-layered structure:\n    - The **fenestrated endothelium** of the glomerular capillaries contains large pores.\n    - The **glomerular basement membrane (GBM)** is a porous gel-like matrix that allows high fluid flux.\n    - The filtration slits between the **podocyte foot processes (pedicels)** provide a final, highly permeable pathway.\n\nThe provided $K_f$ value of $10\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}^{-1}$ is a typical value for the entire renal system, not a single nephron whose individual filtration rate (SNGFR) is on the order of nanoliters per minute. Therefore, the calculated GFR of $130\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$ correctly represents the plausible total GFR for a healthy adult under resting conditions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{130}\n$$", "id": "2569395"}, {"introduction": "Once the filtrate is formed, the nephron's tubules begin the crucial work of modifying its composition, primarily through reabsorption.

The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. The setup is not trivial; it requires a multi-step calculation involving unit conversion and application of a piecewise function for reabsorption.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe task is to compute the urinary glucose excretion rate, denoted as $E_{\\text{glucose}}$. The fundamental relationship governing this process is:\n$$E_{\\text{glucose}} = L_{\\text{glucose}} - R_{\\text{glucose}}$$\nwhere $L_{\\text{glucose}}$ is the filtered load of glucose and $R_{\\text{glucose}}$ is the rate of tubular reabsorption of glucose.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the filtered load of glucose.

Therefore, the problem does not suffer from any invalidating flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, or being ill-posed.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete and reasoned solution follows.\n\nThe fractional excretion of sodium, denoted as $\\text{FENa}$, is defined as the ratio of the rate of sodium excretion ($E_{Na}$) to the rate of sodium filtration, which is the filtered load ($F_{Na}$).\n$$ \\text{FENa} = \\frac{E_{Na}}{F_{Na}} $$\nFrom the problem statement, the excretion rate of sodium ($E_{Na}$) is the product of the urine sodium concentration ($U_{Na}$) and the urine flow rate ($V$).\n$$ E_{Na} = U_{Na} \\times V $$\nThe filtered load of sodium ($F_{Na}$) is the product of the plasma sodium concentration ($P_{Na}$) and the glomerular filtration rate ($GFR$).\n$$ F_{Na} = P_{Na} \\times GFR $$\nSubstituting these expressions into the definition of $\\text{FENa}$ yields:\n$$ \\text{FENa} = \\frac{U_{Na} \\times V}{P_{Na} \\times GFR} $$\nThe problem states that the $GFR$ can be approximated by the clearance of creatinine ($C_{Cr}$), assuming steady state and negligible tubular handling. The clearance of a substance is defined as the volume of plasma from which the substance is completely removed per unit time. It is calculated as the excretion rate of the substance divided by its plasma concentration.\nFor creatinine, its excretion rate is the product of its urine concentration ($U_{Cr}$) and the urine flow rate ($V$). Its plasma concentration is $P_{Cr}$. Thus, the clearance of creatinine is:\n$$ C_{Cr} = \\frac{U_{Cr} \\times V}{P_{Cr}} $$\nUsing the approximation $GFR \\approx C_{Cr}$, we substitute this expression for $GFR$ into our equation for $\\text{FENa}$:\n$$ \\text{FENa} \\approx \\frac{U_{Na} \\times V}{P_{Na} \\times \\left( \\frac{U_{Cr} \\times V}{P_{Cr}} \\right)} $$\nThis is the expression for $\\text{FENa}$ in terms of $U_{Na}$, $P_{Na}$, $U_{Cr}$, $P_{Cr}$, and $V$.

This indicates tubular injury and is characteristic of **intrinsic acute kidney injury (AKI)**, most commonly acute tubular necrosis (ATN).\n\nThe computed value of $0.8571\\%$ is less than $1\\%$. Therefore, based on this result and under the typical assumption that the measurement is not confounded by diuretic use, the pathophysiological state more consistent with this finding is **prerenal azotemia**.
