This practice guides you through a foundational exercise in muscle biophysics: deriving the theoretical active length-tension relationship directly from the geometry of the sarcomere.

Consider the following empirically grounded geometry and assumptions for a vertebrate skeletal muscle fiber:\n\n- Thick filament length is $L_{M} = 1.60\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n- The central myosin bare zone (no cross-bridges) has total length $L_{B} = 0.20\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, so the bare-zone half-length is $b = L_{B}/2$.\n- Thin (actin) filament length is $L_{A} = 1.00\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n- Cross-bridge density per unit axial length is uniform over the myosin head-bearing region; active force is proportional to the total axial overlap length between actin and the myosin head-bearing region.\n- Within each half-sarcomere, the myosin head-bearing region extends from a distance $L_{M}/2$ from the M-line toward the Z-disk up to the bare-zone edge at distance $b$ from the M-line, giving a head-bearing half-length $L_{t} = L_{M}/2 - b$.\n- Neglect filament compliance, lattice spacing effects, and any non-uniformities. Treat the two half-sarcomeres as identical and additive in force.\n- Restrict attention to sarcomere lengths where thin filaments do not overlap across the M-line, i.e., $L_{s} \\ge 2 L_{A}$, so that only the plateau and descending limb of the active length-tension relation are considered.\n\nDefine the half-sarcomere length as $L_{h} = L_{s}/2$, where $L_{s}$ is the Z-disk to Z-disk sarcomere length. Using only the above geometric definitions and the proportionality of active force to overlap length, derive a closed-form, piecewise analytical expression $T(L_{s})$ for the normalized active tension as a function of $L_{s}$, normalized by its maximum value in this geometry. From your derivation, identify three boundary sarcomere lengths, expressed in micrometers:\n\n1) the sarcomere length at which the plateau of active tension begins (transition from the ascending region to the plateau under the no-actin-overlap restriction stated above),\n2) the sarcomere length at which the plateau ends and the descending limb begins,\n3) the sarcomere length on the descending limb at which active tension falls to zero.\n\nExpress the final numerical answers for these three sarcomere lengths in micrometers as a single row matrix in the order listed above. If any quantity requires approximation, round to four significant figures. Use micrometers as the unit for the three reported lengths, and radians or degrees are not applicable here.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It represents a standard, simplified model of the length-tension relationship in skeletal muscle, based on the sliding filament theory. All necessary parameters are provided, and the objectives are clearly defined. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nLet us establish a coordinate system for a single half-sarcomere. We place the origin, $x=0$, at the M-line. The Z-disk is located at $x = L_{h} = L_{s}/2$, where $L_{s}$ is the total sarcomere length.\n\nThe givens are:\n- Thick (myosin) filament length: $L_{M} = 1.60\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n- Myosin bare zone total length: $L_{B} = 0.20\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n- Thin (actin) filament length: $L_{A} = 1.00\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n\nFrom these, we derive key geometric parameters for the half-sarcomere:\n- The thick filament extends from the M-line to a position $x = L_{M}/2$.\n- The myosin bare-zone half-length is $b = L_{B}/2 = 0.10\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n- The myosin head-bearing region in the half-sarcomere is the interval $[b, L_{M}/2]$. The length of this region is $L_{t} = L_{M}/2 - b = 1.60/2 - 0.10 = 0.70\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n- The thin filament is anchored at the Z-disk at $x = L_{s}/2$ and extends towards the M-line. Its coordinates in the half-sarcomere are therefore in the interval $[L_{s}/2 - L_{A}, L_{s}/2]$.\n\nActive tension, $T$, is proportional to the total overlap length, $L_{ov,tot}$, between the actin filaments and the myosin head-bearing regions of both half-sarcomeres. Since the two half-sarcomeres are identical, $L_{ov,tot} = 2 \\times L_{overlap}$, where $L_{overlap}$ is the overlap length in a single half-sarcomere. $L_{overlap}$ is the length of the intersection of the actin filament interval, $[L_{s}/2 - L_{A}, L_{s}/2]$, and the myosin head-bearing interval, $[b, L_{M}/2]$.\n\nThe problem restricts the analysis to sarcomere lengths $L_{s} \\ge 2L_{A}$, which corresponds to the plateau and descending limb of the length-tension curve.\n\nWe define the normalized tension $T(L_{s})$ as the ratio of the total overlap length to its maximum possible value, $L_{ov,max}$. The maximum overlap in one half-sarcomere is the full length of the head-bearing region, $L_{t}$. Thus, $L_{ov,max} = 2 L_{t} = 2(L_{M}/2 - b) = L_{M} - L_{B}$.\n$T(L_{s}) = \\frac{L_{ov,tot}(L_s)}{L_{M} - L_{B}}$.\n\nWe now analyze the overlap in different ranges of $L_{s}$.\n\n1.  **The Plateau Region:**\n    Maximum tension (the plateau) occurs when the actin filament completely covers the myosin head-bearing region. This means the interval $[L_{s}/2 - L_{A}, L_{s}/2]$ must contain the interval $[b, L_{M}/2]$. This requires two conditions:\n    a) The inner tip of the actin filament must be at or inside the bare zone: $L_{s}/2 - L_{A} \\le b$.\n    b) The outer end of the actin filament (at the Z-disk) must be at or beyond the end of the myosin filament: $L_{s}/2 \\ge L_{M}/2$.\n\n    The problem specifies the domain of interest begins at $L_{s} = 2L_{A}$. Let us evaluate this boundary.\n    At $L_{s} = 2L_{A} = 2(1.00) = 2.00\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, the actin tip is at $x = (2L_{A})/2 - L_{A} = 0$. The actin filament occupies the interval $[0, L_{A}]$. The myosin head-bearing region is $[b, L_{M}/2] = [0.10, 0.80]$. The overlap is the intersection of $[0, 1.00]$ and $[0.10, 0.80]$, which is $[0.10, 0.80]$. The overlap length is $0.80 - 0.10 = 0.70\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, which is the maximum possible value, $L_{t}$.\n    Therefore, the plateau of tension begins at the minimum sarcomere length considered under the problem's constraint. This is the first requested boundary length, $L_{s,1}$.\n    $$L_{s,1} = 2 L_{A}$$\n    The plateau ends when the actin tip, at $x=L_{s}/2 - L_{A}$, moves outward and passes the edge of the bare zone at $x=b$. The sarcomere length at which this occurs, $L_{s,2}$, is the second requested boundary length.\n    $$L_{s,2}/2 - L_{A} = b \\implies L_{s,2} = 2(L_{A} + b)$$\n    For any $L_{s}$ such that $L_{s,1} \\le L_{s} \\le L_{s,2}$, the overlap $L_{overlap} = L_{t}$ is constant, and the normalized tension is $T(L_{s}) = 1$.\n\n2.  **The Descending Limb Region:**\n    For $L_{s} > L_{s,2}$, the actin filament is pulled further out, so its tip at $x = L_{s}/2 - L_{A}$ is now greater than $b$. The overlap is now between the actin tip and the end of the myosin filament.\n    The overlap interval is $[L_{s}/2 - L_{A}, L_{M}/2]$. The length is:\n    $$L_{overlap}(L_{s}) = \\frac{L_{M}}{2} - \\left(\\frac{L_{s}}{2} - L_{A}\\right) = L_{A} + \\frac{L_{M}}{2} - \\frac{L_{s}}{2}$$\n    This shows that tension decreases linearly with increasing $L_{s}$. This region is the descending limb.\n\n3.  **Zero Tension:**\n    The active tension falls to zero when the overlap length becomes zero. This occurs when the tip of the actin filament is pulled just to the end of the myosin filament. This defines the third requested boundary length, $L_{s,3}$.\n    $$L_{overlap}(L_{s,3}) = L_{A} + \\frac{L_{M}}{2} - \\frac{L_{s,3}}{2} = 0$$\n    $$L_{s,3} = 2L_{A} + L_{M}$$\n    For $L_s > L_{s,3}$, there is no overlap and thus no active tension.\n\nThe piecewise analytical expression for normalized tension $T(L_{s})$ for $L_{s} \\ge 2L_{A}$ is:\n$$\nT(L_{s}) =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{for } 2L_{A} \\le L_{s} \\le 2(L_{A}+b) \\\\\n\\frac{2L_{A} + L_{M} - L_{s}}{L_{M} - L_{B}} & \\text{for } 2(L_{A}+b) < L_{s} \\le 2L_{A} + L_{M} \\\\\n0 & \\text{for } L_{s} > 2L_{A} + L_{M}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical values of the three boundary sarcomere lengths using the provided data:\n$L_{A} = 1.00\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, $L_{M} = 1.60\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, $L_{B} = 0.20\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, $b = L_{B}/2 = 0.10\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n\n1.  Start of the plateau:\n    $L_{s,1} = 2 L_{A} = 2 \\times 1.00\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 2.00\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n\n2.  End of the plateau / Start of the descending limb:\n    $L_{s,2} = 2(L_{A} + b) = 2 \\times (1.00\\,\\mu\\text{m} + 0.10\\,\\mu\\text{m}) = 2 \\times 1.10\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 2.20\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n\n3.  End of the descending limb (zero tension):\n    $L_{s,3} = 2L_{A} + L_{M} = 2 \\times 1.00\\,\\mu\\text{m} + 1.60\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 2.00\\,\\mu\\text{m} + 1.60\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 3.60\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n\nRounding these exact results to four significant figures as requested: $2.000\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, $2.200\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, and $3.600\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.

The provided rate constants are within physiologically plausible ranges. The problem is a standard exercise in steady-state analysis of a Markov process and is not trivial or ill-posed.\n\nProceeding to solution.\nThe system is modeled as a continuous-time Markov chain. Let $p_i(t)$ be the fractional occupancy (probability) of state $S_i$ at time $t$. The dynamics are described by the chemical master equation, which for the mean populations reduces to the following system of first-order linear ordinary differential equations:\n$$ \\frac{dp_1}{dt} = k_{\\text{ADP}} p_4 - k_{\\text{ATP}} p_1 $$\n$$ \\frac{dp_2}{dt} = k_{\\text{ATP}} p_1 - k_{\\text{hyd}} p_2 $$\n$$ \\frac{dp_3}{dt} = k_{\\text{hyd}} p_2 - k_{P_i} p_3 $$\n$$ \\frac{dp_4}{dt} = k_{P_i} p_3 - k_{\\text{ADP}} p_4 $$\n\nAt steady state, the fractional occupancies are constant, meaning $\\frac{dp_i}{dt} = 0$ for all $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$. This condition transforms the system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations:\n$$ k_{\\text{ADP}} p_4 = k_{\\text{ATP}} p_1 $$\n$$ k_{\\text{ATP}} p_1 = k_{\\text{hyd}} p_2 $$\n$$ k_{\\text{hyd}} p_2 = k_{P_i} p_3 $$\n$$ k_{P_i} p_3 = k_{\\text{ADP}} p_4 $$\n\nThese equations signify that the flux of probability through each step of the cycle is equal. Let this steady-state flux be denoted by $J$.\n$$ J = k_{\\text{ATP}} p_1 = k_{\\text{hyd}} p_2 = k_{P_i} p_3 = k_{\\text{ADP}} p_4 $$\n\nFrom this set of equalities, we can express each fractional occupancy $p_i$ in terms of the flux $J$ and the rate constant $k_{i-1}$ for the transition entering state $i$ (with cyclic indexing), or more simply, in terms of the rate constant $k_i$ for the transition leaving state $i$. Let the rate constant for the transition out of state $S_i$ be denoted $k_i'$, so $k_1' = k_{\\text{ATP}}$, $k_2' = k_{\\text{hyd}}$, $k_3' = k_{P_i}$, and $k_4' = k_{\\text{ADP}}$. Then $p_i = J/k_i'$.\n\nThe mean lifetime of a state $S_i$, denoted $\\tau_i$, is the reciprocal of the total rate of exit from that state. For this irreversible unicyclic scheme, the mean lifetime of each state is simply the reciprocal of the single outgoing rate constant:\n$$ \\tau_1 = \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{ATP}}} $$\n$$ \\tau_2 = \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{hyd}}} $$\n$$ \\tau_3 = \\frac{1}{k_{P_i}} $$\n$$ \\tau_4 = \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{ADP}}} $$\n\nThe steady-state probability of occupying a state is proportional to its mean lifetime: $p_i \\propto \\tau_i$.

Substitute the expression for $b$ from the first equation into the second:\n$$\n\\left(8.0 + a\\right)\\left(1.0 + \\frac{a}{10}\\right) = \\left(20 + a\\right)\\left(\\frac{a}{10}\\right)\n$$\nExpand both sides of the equation to solve for $a$:\n$$\n8.0(1.0) + 8.0\\left(\\frac{a}{10}\\right) + a(1.0) + a\\left(\\frac{a}{10}\\right) = 20\\left(\\frac{a}{10}\\right) + a\\left(\\frac{a}{10}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n8.0 + \\frac{8a}{10} + a + \\frac{a^2}{10} = \\frac{20a}{10} + \\frac{a^2}{10}\n$$\nThe $\\frac{a^2}{10}$ term cancels from both sides:\n$$\n8.0 + 0.8a + a = 2.0a\n$$\n$$\n8.0 + 1.8a = 2.0a\n$$\n$$\n8.0 = 2.0a - 1.8a\n$$\n$$\n8.0 = 0.2a\n$$\n$$\na = \\frac{8.0}{0.2} = 40.0\n$$\nThe units of $a$ are the same as force, so $a = 40.0$ mN. Now, we find $b$:\n$$\nb = \\frac{1}{10}a = \\frac{1}{10}(40.0) = 4.0\n$$\nThe units of $b$ are the same as velocity, so $b = 4.0$ mm/s.\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the optimal velocity $v^{\\ast}$ and maximum power $P_{\\max}$.\n\nMechanical power $P$ is defined as $P = Fv$. To find the power as a function of velocity, $P(v)$, we must first express force $F$ as a function of $v$ by rearranging the Hill equation:\n$$\nF + a = \\frac{\\left(F_{0} + a\\right)b}{v + b}\n$$\n$$\nF(v) = \\frac{\\left(F_{0} + a\\right)b}{v + b} - a\n$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $F(v)$ into the power equation:\n$$\nP(v) = F(v)v = \\left(\\frac{\\left(F_{0} + a\\right)b}{v + b} - a\\right) v = \\frac{\\left(F_{0} + a\\right)bv}{v + b} - av\n$$\nTo find the velocity $v^{\\ast}$ at which power is maximum, we must find the derivative of $P(v)$ with respect to $v$ and set it to zero. Using the quotient rule for the first term and the power rule for the second:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dv} = \\frac{d}{dv}\\left(\\frac{\\left(F_{0} + a\\right)bv}{v + b}\\right) - \\frac{d}{dv}(av)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dv} = \\frac{\\left(F_{0} + a\\right)b(v+b) - \\left(F_{0} + a\\right)bv(1)}{\\left(v + b\\right)^2} - a\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dv} = \\frac{\\left(F_{0} + a\\right)b^2}{\\left(v + b\\right)^2} - a\n$$\nSet the derivative to zero to find the critical point, which corresponds to the optimal velocity $v^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\left(F_{0} + a\\right)b^2}{\\left(v^{\\ast} + b\\right)^2} - a = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\left(v^{\\ast} + b\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\left(F_{0} + a\\right)b^2}{a}\n$$\nTaking the square root of both sides (and considering only positive velocity for muscle shortening):\n$$\nv^{\\ast} + b = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\left(F_{0} + a\\right)b^2}{a}} = b\\sqrt{\\frac{F_{0} + a}{a}}\n$$\nSolving for $v^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nv^{\\ast} = b\\sqrt{\\frac{F_{0} + a}{a}} - b = b\\left(\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{F_{0}}{a}} - 1\\right)\n$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the velocity that maximizes power.\n\nTo find the maximum power $P_{\\max}$, we evaluate the power function $P(v)$ at $v = v^{\\ast}$. First, let's find the force $F^{\\ast}$ at this velocity:\n$$\nF(v^{\\ast}) = \\frac{\\left(F_{0} + a\\right)b}{v^{\\ast} + b} - a = \\frac{\\left(F_{0} + a\\right)b}{b\\sqrt{1 + F_{0}/a}} - a = \\frac{F_{0} + a}{\\sqrt{(F_{0} + a)/a}} - a = \\sqrt{a(F_{0} + a)} - a\n$$\n$P_{\\max} = F(v^{\\ast})v^{\\ast}$. Using the expressions we derived:\n$$\nP_{\\max} = \\left(a\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{F_{0}}{a}} - a\\right) \\left(b\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{F_{0}}{a}} - b\\right)\n$$\n$$\nP_{\\max} = ab\\left(\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{F_{0}}{a}} - 1\\right)^2\n$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for maximum power.\n\nPart 3: Numerical computation of $v^{\\ast}$ and $P_{\\max}$.\n\nWe substitute the given values and the parameters we calculated ($F_{0} = 20.0$ mN, $a = 40.0$ mN, $b = 4.0$ mm/s) into the derived expressions.\n\nFor the optimal velocity $v^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nv^{\\ast} = 4.0 \\left(\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{20.0}{40.0}} - 1\\right) = 4.0 \\left(\\sqrt{1 + 0.5} - 1\\right) = 4.0 \\left(\\sqrt{1.5} - 1\\right)\n$$\n$$\nv^{\\ast} \\approx 4.0 \\left(1.22474487 - 1\\right) = 4.0 \\left(0.22474487\\right) \\approx 0.89897948 \\text{ mm/s}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $v^{\\ast} = 0.8990$ mm/s.\n\nFor the maximum power $P_{\\max}$:\n$$\nP_{\\max} = (40.0)(4.0)\\left(\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{20.0}{40.0}} - 1\\right)^2 = 160.0 \\left(\\sqrt{1.5} - 1\\right)^2\n$$\n$$\nP_{\\max} \\approx 160.0 \\left(0.22474487\\right)^2 \\approx 160.0 \\left(0.0505102\\right) \\approx 8.08163265 \\text{ mN} \\cdot \\text{mm/s}\n$$\nGiven the conversion $1\\,\\text{mN} \\times 1\\,\\text{mm/s} = 1\\,\\mu\\text{W}$, the power is $P_{\\max} \\approx 8.08163$ $\\mu$W.\nRounding to four significant figures, $P_{\\max} = 8.082$ $\\mu$W.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 8.082 & 0.8990 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2608202"}]}
