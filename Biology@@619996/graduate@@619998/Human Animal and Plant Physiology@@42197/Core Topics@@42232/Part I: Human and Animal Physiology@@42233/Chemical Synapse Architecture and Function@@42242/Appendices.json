The mean of this random variable is, by definition, the quantal content, $m$. Thus, we have:\n$$E[N] = m = 200$$\n\nLet $V_i$ be the postsynaptic depolarization produced by the $i$-th vesicle. $V_i$ is also a random variable. The mean of this random variable is, by definition, the quantal size, $q$.

The problem statement explicitly instructs us to use the linearity of expectation. More formally, for a sum of a random number of random variables, where the number of terms $N$ is independent of the individual term values $V_i$, the expectation of the sum is the product of the expectations.

Let us denote the number of vesicles in the RRP immediately before the $k$-th stimulus as $N_k$, for $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$. The stimuli are separated by a constant inter-stimulus interval $\\Delta t = 1/f$.\n\nThe evolution of the system can be decomposed into two distinct phases for each interval between stimuli:\n\n1.  **Instantaneous Depletion:** At the time of a stimulus, a fraction $p$ of the available vesicles is released. The number of vesicles released at the $k$-th stimulus, $R_k$, is given by:\n    $$R_k = p N_k$$\n    Immediately after this release, the number of vesicles in the RRP is reduced to:\n    $$N_k^+ = N_k - R_k = N_k - p N_k = (1 - p) N_k$$\n    Here, $N_k^+$ denotes the pool size immediately after the $k$-th stimulus.\n\n2.  **Continuous Replenishment:** Between stimuli, from time $t_k^+$ (just after stimulus $k$) to time $t_{k+1}^-$ (just before stimulus $k+1$), the RRP replenishes. This process is governed by the first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n    $$\\frac{dN}{dt} = \\frac{N_{\\max} - N}{\\tau}$$\n    This is a linear first-order ODE. We can solve it by separation of variables or by using an integrating factor. The general solution is:\n    $$N(t) = N_{\\max} + C e^{-t/\\tau}$$\n    where $C$ is a constant of integration. We solve for the evolution during the inter-stimulus interval of duration $\\Delta t$.
