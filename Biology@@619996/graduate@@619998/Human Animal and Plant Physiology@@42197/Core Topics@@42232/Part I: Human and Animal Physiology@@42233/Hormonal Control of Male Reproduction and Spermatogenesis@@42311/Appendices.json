According to the free hormone hypothesis, only the unbound, free fraction of testosterone is biologically active. This free testosterone exerts negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Specifically, it inhibits the secretion of Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus and Luteinizing Hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary. A decrease in free testosterone, as calculated, weakens this negative feedback signal. Consequently, the neuroendocrine system will respond by increasing the pulsatile secretion of LH from the pituitary to restore homeostasis. This compensatory rise in LH would normally stimulate the testicular Leydig cells to produce more testosterone, thereby raising both total and free testosterone levels. The problem's constraint of fixed total testosterone isolates the direct impact of SHBG on free hormone concentration and the resulting initial feedback response.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8513}$$", "id": "2574601"}, {"introduction": "While systemic hormone levels regulate the HPG axis, spermatogenesis itself depends on a vastly different local environment within the testes.

Let $Z$ be the random variable representing the number of SSC offspring produced by a single SSC parent in one cycle. The possible values for $Z$ are $0$, $1$, and $2$.\n-   The probability of producing $0$ SSC offspring (both daughters differentiate) is $P(Z=0) = (1-p)(1-p) = (1-p)^2$.\n-   The probability of producing $1$ SSC offspring (one self-renews, one differentiates) is $P(Z=1) = \\binom{2}{1}p^1(1-p)^1 = 2p(1-p)$.\n-   The probability of producing $2$ SSC offspring (both self-renew) is $P(Z=2) = p \\cdot p = p^2$.\n\nThe expected number of SSC offspring from a single SSC parent, denoted by $\\mu$, is the mean of this distribution:\n$$ \\mu = \\mathbb{E}[Z] = \\sum_{k=0}^{2} k \\cdot P(Z=k) $$\n$$ \\mu = (0) \\cdot (1-p)^2 + (1) \\cdot 2p(1-p) + (2) \\cdot p^2 $$\n$$ \\mu = 2p - 2p^2 + 2p^2 = 2p $$\nThis result also follows directly from the linearity of expectation, as the total number of SSC offspring is the sum of two independent Bernoulli trials, each with success probability $p$.\n\nThe total number of SSCs at cycle $t+1$, $N_{t+1}$, is the sum of the SSC offspring from each of the $N_t$ SSCs present at cycle $t$.\n$$ N_{t+1} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_t} Z_i $$\nwhere each $Z_i$ is an independent random variable with the same distribution as $Z$ described above.\n\nTo find the expectation of $N_{t+1}$, we use the law of total expectation (or iterated expectation):\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[N_{t+1}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[N_{t+1} \\mid N_t]] $$\nGiven the value of $N_t$, the conditional expectation of $N_{t+1}$ is:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[N_{t+1} \\mid N_t] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N_t} Z_i \\mid N_t\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_t} \\mathbb{E}[Z_i] = N_t \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[Z] = N_t \\mu $$\nSubstituting this back into the law of total expectation:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[N_{t+1}] = \\mathbb{E}[N_t \\mu] = \\mu \\mathbb{E}[N_t] $$\nThis is a simple linear recurrence relation for the expected population size. Given that $\\mathbb{E}[N_0] = N_0$ (as the initial state is a fixed quantity), the solution to this recurrence is elementary:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[N_t] = \\mu^t \\mathbb{E}[N_0] = \\mu^t N_0 $$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $\\mu = 2p$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[N_t \\mid p] = (2p)^t N_0 $$\n\nWe are asked to find the fold-change $R$ between two conditions: a baseline with probability $p_0 = 0.3$ and an elevated GDNF condition with probability $p_1 = 0.5$.\nThe expected number of cells in each case is:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[N_t \\mid p_0] = (2p_0)^t N_0 $$\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[N_t \\mid p_1] = (2p_1)^t N_0 $$\nThe fold-change ratio $R$ is defined as:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[N_{t} \\mid p_1]}{\\mathbb{E}[N_{t} \\mid p_0]} = \\frac{(2p_1)^t N_0}{(2p_0)^t N_0} $$\nThe initial population size $N_0$ cancels, as does the factor of $2$, yielding the final analytic expression for $R$:\n$$ R = \\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_0}\\right)^t $$\nThis is the required analytic expression.\n\nNow, we must compute the numerical value for $t=10$, $p_0 = 0.3$, and $p_1 = 0.5$.\n$$ R = \\left(\\frac{0.5}{0.3}\\right)^{10} = \\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)^{10} $$\nCalculation of this value gives:\n$$ R = \\frac{5^{10}}{3^{10}} = \\frac{9765625}{59049} \\approx 165.3817... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ R \\approx 165 $$\nThis completes the derivation and calculation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{165}\n$$", "id": "2574640"}]}
