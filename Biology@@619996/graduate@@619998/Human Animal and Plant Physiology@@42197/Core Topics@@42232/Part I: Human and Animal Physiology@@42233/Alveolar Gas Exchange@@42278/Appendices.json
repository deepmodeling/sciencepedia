It presents a standard problem in biophysical transport phenomena, using established principles and realistic physiological parameters. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the steady-state oxygen flux density, $J_{\\text{O}_{2}}$, across the alveolar-capillary barrier and compute its numerical value.\n\nThe analysis begins with Fick's first law of diffusion, which describes the flux density of a substance. For one-dimensional diffusion in the $x$-direction, the law is stated as:\n$$J = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}$$\nwhere $J$ is the flux density (amount of substance per unit area per unit time), $D$ is the diffusion coefficient (diffusivity), and $\\frac{dC}{dx}$ is the concentration gradient. The negative sign indicates that diffusion occurs from a region of higher concentration to one of lower concentration.\n\nThe problem states that the diffusion is at steady state and the concentration profile is linear across the barrier of thickness $T$. Under these conditions, the concentration gradient is constant and can be expressed as:\n$$\\frac{dC}{dx} = \\frac{C_{2} - C_{1}}{T} = -\\frac{C_{1} - C_{2}}{T} = -\\frac{\\Delta C}{T}$$\nwhere $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ are the concentrations at the two boundaries of the barrier, and $\\Delta C = C_{1} - C_{2}$ is the concentration difference. The magnitude of the flux density is therefore:\n$$J_{\\text{O}_{2}} = \\left| -D \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta C}{T}\\right) \\right| = D \\frac{\\Delta C}{T}$$\nHere, $\\Delta C$ represents the difference in the concentration of dissolved oxygen between the alveolar side and the capillary side of the barrier.\n\nNext, we must relate the concentration of dissolved oxygen, $C$, to its partial pressure, $P_{\\text{O}_{2}}$. This relationship is given by Henry's law:\n$$C = \\alpha' P_{\\text{O}_{2}}$$\nwhere $\\alpha'$ is the Henry's law solubility coefficient expressed in molar concentration units (e.g., $\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}\\,\\text{pressure}^{-1}$). The difference in concentration, $\\Delta C$, across the barrier is thus proportional to the difference in partial pressure, $\\Delta P_{\\text{O}_{2}}$:\n$$\\Delta C = \\alpha' \\Delta P_{\\text{O}_{2}}$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $\\Delta C$ into the equation for flux density, we obtain the formula for the steady-state oxygen flux density in terms of the given parameters:\n$$J_{\\text{O}_{2}} = D \\frac{\\alpha' \\Delta P_{\\text{O}_{2}}}{T}$$\n\nThe provided solubility coefficient, $\\alpha = 0.003\\,\\text{mL O}_{2}\\,(\\text{STPD})/(\\text{dL}\\cdot\\text{mmHg})$, must be converted into the appropriate molar units for $\\alpha'$. The conversion requires transforming the volume of oxygen gas at Standard Temperature and Pressure, Dry (STPD) into moles, and the volume of the solvent (plasma) into SI units ($\\text{m}^{3}$).\n\nWe use the ideal gas molar volume at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), $V_{m} = 22.414\\,\\text{L/mol}$.

It is based on fundamental principles of respiratory physiology and provides consistent, realistic data. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the physiologic dead space volume, denoted $V_D$. This derivation rests upon the principle of conservation of mass applied to carbon dioxide ($\\text{CO}_2$) during a single tidal breath. The total amount of $\\text{CO}_2$ exhaled in the tidal volume, $V_T$, must be equal to the amount of $\\text{CO}_2$ originating from the alveolar gas volume, $V_A$, since the dead space volume, $V_D$, is assumed to contain gas of the same composition as inspired air, which is stated to have negligible $\\text{CO}_2$.\n\nThe tidal volume $V_T$ is the sum of the alveolar volume $V_A$ and the physiologic dead space volume $V_D$:\n$$V_T = V_A + V_D$$\nfrom which it follows that\n$$V_A = V_T - V_D$$\n\nLet us establish the mass balance for $\\text{CO}_2$. The total amount of $\\text{CO}_2$ in the mixed expired gas volume $V_T$ is the product of its mean fractional concentration, $F_{E\\text{CO}_2}$, and the volume $V_T$. This total amount is the sum of the $\\text{CO}_2$ contributed by the dead space volume $V_D$ and the alveolar volume $V_A$.\nThe mass balance equation for the volume of $\\text{CO}_2$ is:\n$$F_{E\\text{CO}_2} \\cdot V_T = F_{D\\text{CO}_2} \\cdot V_D + F_{A\\text{CO}_2} \\cdot V_A$$\nwhere $F_{D\\text{CO}_2}$ is the fractional concentration of $\\text{CO}_2$ in the dead space gas and $F_{A\\text{CO}_2}$ is the fractional concentration of $\\text{CO}_2$ in the alveolar gas.\n\nThe dead space gas is the portion of inspired air that does not reach the alveoli, thus its composition is that of inspired air. Therefore, $F_{D\\text{CO}_2} = F_{I\\text{CO}_2}$, where $F_{I\\text{CO}_2}$ is the fractional concentration of $\\text{CO}_2$ in inspired air. The problem states we must assume that inspired $\\text{CO}_2$ is negligible, which means $F_{I\\text{CO}_2} \\approx 0$. The mass balance equation simplifies to:\n$$F_{E\\text{CO}_2} \\cdot V_T = F_{A\\text{CO}_2} \\cdot V_A$$\n\nAccording to Dalton's law of partial pressures, the partial pressure of a gas, $P_x$, is its fractional concentration, $F_x$, multiplied by the total pressure, $P_{total}$. Assuming the total pressure is constant for all gas compartments (a standard simplification), we can substitute partial pressures for fractional concentrations, as the $P_{total}$ term would cancel from both sides of the equation. We use the mean mixed expired partial pressure $\\bar P_{E\\text{CO}_2}$ and the alveolar partial pressure $P_{A\\text{CO}_2}$:\n$$\\bar P_{E\\text{CO}_2} \\cdot V_T = P_{A\\text{CO}_2} \\cdot V_A$$\n\nNow, substitute the expression for $V_A$:\n$$\\bar P_{E\\text{CO}_2} \\cdot V_T = P_{A\\text{CO}_2} \\cdot (V_T - V_D)$$\n\nWe are tasked to find an expression for $V_D$.

Substituting this into our expression yields the final derived formula, known as the Bohr equation modified for physiologic dead space:\n$$V_D = V_T \\cdot \\frac{P_{a\\text{CO}_2} - \\bar P_{E\\text{CO}_2}}{P_{a\\text{CO}_2}}$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided data:\n- $P_{a\\text{CO}_2} = 44\\,\\text{mmHg}$\n- $\\bar P_{E\\text{CO}_2} = 32\\,\\text{mmHg}$\n- $V_T = 450\\,\\text{ml}$\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$V_D = 450\\,\\text{ml} \\cdot \\frac{44\\,\\text{mmHg} - 32\\,\\text{mmHg}}{44\\,\\text{mmHg}}$$\n$$V_D = 450\\,\\text{ml} \\cdot \\frac{12}{44}$$\n$$V_D = 450\\,\\text{ml} \\cdot \\frac{3}{11}$$\n$$V_D = \\frac{1350}{11}\\,\\text{ml} \\approx 122.7272... \\,\\text{ml}$$\n\nThe result must be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$V_D \\approx 123\\,\\text{ml}$$\n\nFinally, the physiologic significance of the computed value must be stated.
