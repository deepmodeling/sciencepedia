It requires the application of fundamental principles of biophysical transport phenomena, specifically the thermodynamics of water movement across a semipermeable membrane. We shall proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe initial volumetric water flux across a membrane is described by the principles of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, as formulated in the Kedem-Katchalsky equations. The volumetric flux per unit area, $J_V$, is driven by differences in hydrostatic pressure, $\\Delta P$, and osmotic pressure, $\\Delta \\Pi$. The equation is:\n$$J_V = L_p (\\Delta P - \\sigma \\Delta \\Pi)$$\nwhere $L_p$ is the hydraulic conductivity of the membrane and $\\sigma$ is the reflection coefficient, which quantifies the membrane's impermeability to a given solute.\n\nThe problem provides the following conditions:\n1. The hydrostatic pressure difference is zero: $\\Delta P = 0$.\n2. The solute is effectively impermeant, which implies a reflection coefficient of unity: $\\sigma \\approx 1$.\n\nUnder these conditions, the equation for the magnitude of the flux per unit area simplifies to:\n$$J_V = L_p \\Delta \\Pi$$\nThe total volumetric flux, $J_v$, across the entire membrane area, $A$, is therefore:\n$$J_v = A \\cdot J_V = A L_p \\Delta \\Pi$$\nThe osmotic pressure difference, $\\Delta \\Pi$, for a dilute solution is given by the van 't Hoff equation:\n$$\\Delta \\Pi = R T \\Delta C$$\nwhere $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $\\Delta C$ is the difference in molar concentration of the impermeant solute across themembrane.

We will proceed to a formal solution.\n\nThe problem describes water flow through a leaf as a system comprising two hydraulic components arranged in series: the xylem pathway (denoted by subscript $xyl,leaf$) and the outside-xylem pathway (denoted by subscript $ox$).\n\nAccording to the provided information, the volumetric flux density, $J$, through any segment is related to the water potential drop, $\\Delta \\Psi$, across that segment by its hydraulic conductance, $K$:\n$$J = K \\Delta \\Psi$$\nFor a system of components in series, under steady-state conditions, two principles apply:\n$1$.

The total drop in water potential across the entire system is the sum of the drops across the individual components:\n$$\\Delta \\Psi_{leaf} = \\Delta \\Psi_{xyl} + \\Delta \\Psi_{ox}$$\nFrom the flow equation, we can express the water potential drop across each component as $\\Delta \\Psi = J/K$.

The problem defines hydraulic resistance $R$ as the reciprocal of conductance, $R = 1/K$. In terms of resistance, the equation becomes:\n$$R_{leaf} = R_{xyl} + R_{ox}$$\nThis confirms that hydraulic resistances add in series, which is the correct physical analogy.\n\nFirst, we calculate the composite leaf conductance $K_{leaf}$ using the given values:\n$K_{xyl,leaf} = 6$ mmol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ MPa$^{-1}$\n$K_{ox} = 3$ mmol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ MPa$^{-1}$\nSubstituting these into the conductance formula:\n$$\\frac{1}{K_{leaf}} = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nTherefore, the composite leaf conductance is:\n$$K_{leaf} = 2 \\text{ mmol m}^{-2} \\text{s}^{-1} \\text{MPa}^{-1}$$\nAs required, this value must be reported to four significant figures, which is $2.000$.\n\nSecond, we calculate the ratio of the segment resistances, $R_{ox}/R_{xyl}$.
