Task 4: Compute $I$ for the evaluated $\\theta$.\n\nValidation Verdict:\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, rooted in fundamental principles of chemical kinetics and receptor theory. The FLS2-flg22 interaction is a canonical model system in molecular plant pathology. The assumptions, such as single-site binding and excess ligand, are standard simplifications used to derive the Hill-Langmuir isotherm, a cornerstone of biophysical chemistry. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions, variables, and parameters for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. No flaws are detected. The problem is valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe derivation begins with the reversible binding reaction:\n$$R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$$\nHere, $R$ represents the free receptor (FLS2), $L$ represents the free ligand (flg22), and $RL$ is the receptor-ligand complex.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the rate of association (forward reaction) is proportional to the concentrations of the reactants:\n$$v_{f} = k_{\\text{on}} [R] [L]$$\nwhere $k_{\\text{on}}$ is the association rate constant. The rate of dissociation (reverse reaction) is proportional to the concentration of the complex:\n$$v_{r} = k_{\\text{off}} [RL]$$\nwhere $k_{\\text{off}}$ is the dissociation rate constant.\n\nAt equilibrium, the rate of association equals the rate of dissociation:\n$$v_{f} = v_{r}$$\n$$k_{\\text{on}} [R] [L] = k_{\\text{off}} [RL]$$\n\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined as the ratio of the dissociation rate constant to the association rate constant:\n$$K_d = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}}$$\nSubstituting this definition into the equilibrium condition gives:\n$$k_{\\text{on}} [R] [L] = (k_{\\text{on}} K_d) [RL]$$\nDividing by $k_{\\text{on}}$ (which is non-zero) yields the expression for $K_d$ in terms of equilibrium concentrations, as required by the problem statement:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\n\nThe fractional receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the fraction of total receptors that are bound by the ligand. The total concentration of receptors, $[R]_T$, is the sum of free receptors, $[R]$, and bound receptors, $[RL]$:\n$$[R]_T = [R] + [RL]$$\nThe fractional occupancy $\\theta$ is therefore:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_T} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]}$$\nTo express $\\theta$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_d$, we first rearrange the equilibrium expression to solve for $[R]$:\n$$[R] = K_d \\frac{[RL]}{[L]}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the denominator of the equation for $\\theta$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{\\left( K_d \\frac{[RL]}{[L]} \\right) + [RL]}$$\nAssuming a non-zero ligand concentration, $[RL]$ is also non-zero, allowing us to factor $[RL]$ from the denominator and cancel it:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[RL] \\left( \\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1 \\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1}$$\nTo simplify, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $[L]$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}$$\nThis completes the required derivation. This is the Hill-Langmuir equation for a system with a Hill coefficient of $1$.\n\nNext, we evaluate $\\theta$ for the given parameters: $[L] = 10 \\text{ nM}$ and $K_d = 1 \\text{ nM}$. The units are consistent and will cancel.\n$$\\theta = \\frac{10}{1 + 10} = \\frac{10}{11}$$\nThis is the exact value for the fractional occupancy.\n\nFinally, we compute the binary signaling outcome $I$, which is governed by the Heaviside step rule $I=1$ if $\\theta \\ge \\theta_T$ and $I=0$ if $\\theta  \\theta_T$, with a given threshold $\\theta_T = 0.5$. We must compare our calculated $\\theta$ to $\\theta_T$:\nIs $\\frac{10}{11} \\ge 0.5$?\nWe can write $0.5$ as $\\frac{1}{2}$. The inequality is $\\frac{10}{11} \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$.\nBy cross-multiplication (as both denominators are positive), we compare $10 \\times 2$ and $11 \\times 1$.\nWe find that $20 \\ge 11$, which is a true statement.\nTherefore, the condition $\\theta \\ge \\theta_T$ is met. According to the rule, the signaling outcome is:\n$$I = 1$$\n\nThe requested values are $\\theta = \\frac{10}{11}$ and $I = 1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{10}{11}  1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2598274"}, {"introduction": "Effective signal transduction often requires the assembly of multi-protein complexes.
