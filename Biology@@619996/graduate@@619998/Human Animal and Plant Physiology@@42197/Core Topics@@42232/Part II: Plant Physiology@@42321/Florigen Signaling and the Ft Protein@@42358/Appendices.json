It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for the fractional occupancy of the FD–14-3-3 module, which we denote as $M$, by the competing ligands FT and TFL1. The system is at equilibrium and involves the following reactions:\n$$\nM + \\mathrm{FT} \\rightleftharpoons M \\text{-} \\mathrm{FT}\n$$\n$$\nM + \\mathrm{TFL1} \\rightleftharpoons M \\text{-} \\mathrm{TFL1}\n$$\nAccording to the law of mass action, the dissociation constants for these reactions are defined as:\n$$\nK_{d}^{\\mathrm{FT}} = \\frac{[M][\\mathrm{FT}]}{[M\\text{-}\\mathrm{FT}]}\n$$\n$$\nK_{d}^{\\mathrm{TFL1}} = \\frac{[M][\\mathrm{TFL1}]}{[M\\text{-}\\mathrm{TFL1}]}\n$$\nwhere $[M]$ is the concentration of the free, unbound module, $[\\mathrm{FT}]$ and $[\\mathrm{TFL1}]$ are the free concentrations of the ligands, and $[M\\text{-}\\mathrm{FT}]$ and $[M\\text{-}\\mathrm{TFL1}]$ are the concentrations of the bound complexes. The problem states we can assume ligand concentrations are constant.\n\nThe total concentration of the module, $[M]_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the concentrations of all its possible states: unbound, bound to FT, and bound to TFL1.\n$$\n[M]_{\\text{total}} = [M] + [M\\text{-}\\mathrm{FT}] + [M\\text{-}\\mathrm{TFL1}]\n$$\nThis equation correctly accounts for the unbound state of the module. The fractional occupancy of the module by FT, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{FT}}$, is defined as the ratio of the concentration of FT-bound modules to the total concentration of modules:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{FT}} = \\frac{[M\\text{-}\\mathrm{FT}]}{[M]_{\\text{total}}}\n$$\nSimilarly, the fractional occupancy by TFL1, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{TFL1}}$, is:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{TFL1}} = \\frac{[M\\text{-}\\mathrm{TFL1}]}{[M]_{\\text{total}}}\n$$\nTo derive the expressions for these occupancies, we first express the concentrations of the bound complexes in terms of the free module concentration, $[M]$, using the definitions of the dissociation constants:\n$$\n[M\\text{-}\\mathrm{FT}] = \\frac{[M][\\mathrm{FT}]}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{FT}}}\n$$\n$$\n[M\\text{-}\\mathrm{TFL1}] = \\frac{[M][\\mathrm{TFL1}]}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{TFL1}}}\n$$\nNow, substitute these expressions into the equation for the total module concentration:\n$$\n[M]_{\\text{total}} = [M] + \\frac{[M][\\mathrm{FT}]}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{FT}}} + \\frac{[M][\\mathrm{TFL1}]}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{TFL1}}}\n$$\nFactoring out the free module concentration $[M]$ yields:\n$$\n[M]_{\\text{total}} = [M] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{FT}]}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{FT}}} + \\frac{[\\mathrm{TFL1}]}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{TFL1}}} \\right)\n$$\nWe can now substitute the expressions for $[M\\text{-}\\mathrm{FT}]$ and $[M]_{\\text{total}}$ into the definition of $\\theta_{\\mathrm{FT}}$:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{FT}} = \\frac{\\frac{[M][\\mathrm{FT}]}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{FT}}}}{[M] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{FT}]}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{FT}}} + \\frac{[\\mathrm{TFL1}]}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{TFL1}}} \\right)}\n$$\nThe concentration of the free module, $[M]$, cancels, yielding the final expression for the fractional occupancy by FT:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{FT}} = \\frac{\\frac{[\\mathrm{FT}]}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{FT}}}}{1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{FT}]}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{FT}}} + \\frac{[\\mathrm{TFL1}]}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{TFL1}}}}\n$$\nBy an identical derivation, the fractional occupancy by TFL1 is:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{TFL1}} = \\frac{\\frac{[\\mathrm{TFL1}]}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{TFL1}}}}{1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{FT}]}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{FT}}} + \\frac{[\\mathrm{TFL1}]}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{TFL1}}}}\n$$\nThese expressions are derived from first principles as required. Now, we evaluate them numerically using the provided data:\n$K_{d}^{\\mathrm{FT}} = 30\\,\\text{nM}$, $K_{d}^{\\mathrm{TFL1}} = 60\\,\\text{nM}$, $[\\mathrm{FT}] = 120\\,\\text{nM}$, and $[\\mathrm{TFL1}] = 180\\,\\text{nM}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the dimensionless concentration terms:\n$$\n\\frac{[\\mathrm{FT}]}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{FT}}} = \\frac{120\\,\\text{nM}}{30\\,\\text{nM}} = 4\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{[\\mathrm{TFL1}]}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{TFL1}}} = \\frac{180\\,\\text{nM}}{60\\,\\text{nM}} = 3\n$$\nThe denominator for both fractional occupancy expressions is the sum:\n$$\n1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{FT}]}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{FT}}} + \\frac{[\\mathrm{TFL1}]}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{TFL1}}} = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8\n$$\nNow, we can compute the fractional occupancies:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{FT}} = \\frac{4}{8} = 0.5\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{TFL1}} = \\frac{3}{8} = 0.375\n$$\nThe fraction of unbound modules is $\\theta_{\\text{unbound}} = \\frac{1}{8} = 0.125$. The sum of all fractions is $\\theta_{\\mathrm{FT}} + \\theta_{\\mathrm{TFL1}} + \\theta_{\\text{unbound}} = 0.5 + 0.375 + 0.125 = 1$, as expected.\n\nFinally, we predict the predominant transcriptional program. The FT–FD–14-3-3 complex is an activator, while the TFL1–FD–14-3-3 complex is a repressor. The relative abundance of these two complexes determines the net output. Comparing the fractional occupancies, we find that $\\theta_{\\mathrm{FT}} = 0.5$ is greater than $\\theta_{\\mathrm{TFL1}} = 0.375$. This means that at any given moment, $50\\%$ of the FD–14-3-3 modules are bound to the activator FT, while only $37.5\\%$ are bound to the repressor TFL1. Because the concentration of the activator complex is higher than that of the repressor complex, the transcriptional program of activation will predominate. This leads to the expression of floral meristem identity genes, promoting the transition to flowering.\n\nThe problem requires reporting the fractional occupancy by FT, rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $0.5$. To express this with four significant figures, we write $0.5000$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5000}$$", "id": "2569062"}, {"introduction": "Biological pathways are dynamic systems that integrate multiple signals over time to produce a coherent output.

The model itself is a well-established, albeit simplified, representation of photoperiodic flowering control in plants, founded on the principles of gene expression dynamics.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two primary stages: ($1$) generation of synthetic time-course data by numerical integration of the provided ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and ($2$) estimation of the model parameters from this synthetic data using a linear least-squares method based on finite-difference approximations of the time derivatives.\n\nThe system of ODEs is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{d[CO]}{dt} = k_{syn,CO}\\,g(t) - k_{deg,CO}\\,[CO]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d[FT]}{dt} = k_{prod,FT}\\,[CO]\\cdot L(t) - k_{deg,FT}\\,[FT]\n$$\nwhere $[CO](t)$ and $[FT](t)$ are the state variables.

This is achieved by numerically solving the system of ODEs from $t=0\\,\\mathrm{h}$ to $t=48\\,\\mathrm{h}$. The true parameter values are fixed at $k_{syn,CO}=2.0\\,\\mathrm{a.u.}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, $k_{deg,CO}=0.4\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, $k_{prod,FT}=1.5\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, and $k_{deg,FT}=0.2\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. Each case has a distinct light function $L(t)$ and specific initial conditions for $[CO](0)$ and $[FT](0)$.\n\nA high-accuracy numerical integrator, such as the Dormand-Prince method (RKDP), as implemented in `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`, is employed to solve the initial value problem. The solution is evaluated at discrete time points $t_i = \\{0, 1, 2, ..., 48\\}$, producing time series for the concentrations, $\\{[CO](t_i)\\}$ and $\\{[FT](t_i)\\}$. This sampling interval corresponds to $\\Delta t = 1\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n\n**Stage 2: Parameter Estimation**\n\nThe core of the task is to recover the original parameters from the generated time-series data. The problem specifies a method that linearizes the differential equations. This avoids a computationally expensive non-linear optimization routine.\n\nFirst, the time derivatives $\\frac{d[CO]}{dt}$ and $\\frac{d[FT]}{dt}$ are approximated from the discrete data points $\\{[CO](t_i)\\}$ and $\\{[FT](t_i)\\}$ using a finite difference scheme. As required, we use a centered difference for all interior points ($i=1, ..., N-2$) and one-sided (forward/backward) differences for the boundary points ($i=0$ and $i=N-1$). This is implemented efficiently using a standard numerical gradient function.\n\nThe two ODEs can be rearranged into the form of a linear matrix equation, $Y = X\\beta$.\n\nFor the $[CO]$ dynamics, the equation at each time point $t_i$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d[CO]}{dt}(t_i) \\approx k_{syn,CO}\\,g(t_i) - k_{deg,CO}\\,[CO](t_i)\n$$\nThis can be formulated as a linear regression problem. Let $\\mathbf{y}_{CO}$ be a column vector of the approximated derivative values $\\frac{d[CO]}{dt}(t_i)$. Let $\\mathbf{X}_{CO}$ be a matrix of size $N \\times 2$, where $N$ is the number of time points. The first column of $\\mathbf{X}_{CO}$ contains the values of $g(t_i)$, and the second column contains the values of $-[CO](t_i)$. The parameter vector is $\\mathbf{\\beta}_{CO} = [k_{syn,CO}, k_{deg,CO}]^T$. We solve the system $\\mathbf{y}_{CO} = \\mathbf{X}_{CO}\\mathbf{\\beta}_{CO}$ for $\\mathbf{\\beta}_{CO}$ using ordinary least squares (OLS), which finds the vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\beta}}_{CO}$ that minimizes the sum of squared residuals $||\\mathbf{y}_{CO} - \\mathbf{X}_{CO}\\mathbf{\\beta}_{CO}||_2^2$.\n\nSimilarly, for the $[FT]$ dynamics, the equation at each time point $t_i$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d[FT]}{dt}(t_i) \\approx k_{prod,FT}\\,[CO](t_i)L(t_i) - k_{deg,FT}\\,[FT](t_i)\n$$\nThis is also a linear regression problem. Let $\\mathbf{y}_{FT}$ be the vector of derivative values $\\frac{d[FT]}{dt}(t_i)$. The design matrix $\\mathbf{X}_{FT}$ has a first column containing the interaction term $[CO](t_i)L(t_i)$ and a second column containing $-[FT](t_i)$. The parameter vector is $\\mathbf{\\beta}_{FT} = [k_{prod,FT}, k_{deg,FT}]^T$. The OLS solution provides the estimates $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\beta}}_{FT}$.\n\nA special condition arises in Case $3$ (constant dark), where $L(t)=0$ for all $t$. In this situation, the regressor for $k_{prod,FT}$, which is $[CO](t_i)L(t_i)$, is identically zero. This makes the parameter $k_{prod,FT}$ non-identifiable from the data. As per the problem's directive, we handle this by setting the estimate $\\hat{k}_{prod,FT} = 0.0$ by convention. The remaining parameter, $k_{deg,FT}$, is then estimated from the simplified decay equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d[FT]}{dt}(t_i) \\approx -k_{deg,FT}\\,[FT](t_i)\n$$\nThis is a simple linear regression with a single independent variable, $-[FT](t_i)$.\n\nThis entire procedure is applied to each of the four test cases.

This will be achieved using two complementary techniques: *in vivo* Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (ChIP-qPCR) and *in vitro* Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA). The evaluation of the proposed experimental options must be based on established principles of molecular biology, paying strict attention to the inclusion of appropriate controls to ensure the specificity and validity of the conclusions. The biological context is that $CO$ protein levels are high at dusk under Long Day (LD) conditions, promoting $FT$ transcription, and very low under Short Day (SD) conditions, leading to $FT$ repression.\n\nA. This option presents a comprehensive and methodologically sound experimental design.\nFor ChIP-qPCR, the use of a transgenic line expressing $CO$ fused to a Hemagglutinin ($HA$) tag under its native promoter is the gold standard. This allows for specific immunoprecipitation with a high-affinity anti-$HA$ antibody, avoiding the common problem of non-specific antibodies against native proteins. The inclusion of a `$co$ loss-of-function mutant` as a genetic negative control is excellent, as it proves that any signal is dependent on the $CO$ protein. Growing plants under LD and SD and harvesting at Zeitgeber Time (ZT) $16$ is the correct experimental setup to test the hypothesis, as this timing is expected to show the maximal difference in $CO$ protein levels. The procedural details are correct: formaldehyde crosslinking, chromatin shearing to an optimal size of $\\sim$$200$–$500$ bp, and, critically, the inclusion of both an Immunoglobulin G (IgG) isotype control (to control for non-specific binding to the antibody/beads) and an input DNA fraction (for normalization). The qPCR analysis strategy is also robust, proposing primers for the target $FT$ promoter versus a `distal intergenic region` as a negative locus control. Normalization using the input fraction (e.g., via percent input or a $\\Delta \\Delta C_t$ method) is the correct quantitative approach. The expected directionality—significantly higher enrichment at $CORE$ sites in LD versus SD, with no enrichment in any of the negative controls (IgG, `$co$` mutant, negative locus)—is scientifically correct.\nFor EMSA, the design is equally rigorous. Using nuclear extracts from LD-grown ZT $16$ $CO$-$HA$ plants or recombinant $CO$ is appropriate. The use of a labeled oligonucleotide containing a wild-type ($WT$) $CORE$ motif is standard. Crucially, all necessary specificity controls are included: $1$) competition with an excess of unlabeled $WT$ competitor DNA to reduce the shifted band, $2$) lack of competition with a $CORE$-mutated competitor to show sequence specificity, and $3$) a supershift assay with an anti-$HA$ antibody to definitively identify $CO$-$HA$ in the protein-DNA complex. The inclusion of extracts from a `$co$` mutant as a negative control further solidifies the experiment.\nThis option describes a complete workflow that would provide strong, specific evidence for the hypothesis. **Correct**.\n\nB. This option contains multiple fundamental flaws. Using `wild-type untagged plants` with an `anti-Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)` antibody is nonsensical, as there is no $GFP$ to immunoprecipitate. Harvesting at ZT $4$ is a suboptimal time to test the hypothesis about dusk-dependent activity. The omission of input normalization and an IgG control are critical errors that invalidate any potential results. The expectation of `higher CO occupancy in SD` is scientifically false; $CO$ is an activator, and its occupancy is expected to be lower in SD when $FT$ is repressed. For the EMSA, `ethidium bromide-stained probes` lack the necessary sensitivity. The use of `RNase` as a specificity control is irrelevant for a DNA-protein interaction. The omission of standard competitor and supershift assays makes it impossible to determine specificity. **Incorrect**.\n\nC. This option is fundamentally flawed in its approach and execution. Using a constitutive `$35$S:$CO$ overexpression line` is inappropriate for studying the *native photoperiod-dependent* regulation of $CO$ binding. The absence of genetic and IgG controls in avalidates the ChIP experiment. Normalization `by equal volumes` is not a scientifically valid method. The EMSA design is scientifically backward, stating that a `mutated unlabeled competitor` would compete *more* effectively than a $WT$ one, which contradicts the principle of specific binding. The lack of a supershift control is another major omission. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. This option is also deeply flawed. The experimental design for ChIP-qPCR omits the crucial `IgG control`, making it impossible to distinguish specific signal from background. The choice of a `coding exon within FT` as a negative control region is poor, as regions undergoing active transcription can have high non-specific background. The provided time points and comparison groups (lacking SD ZT $16$) are not optimal for testing the central hypothesis. The stated expectations are scientifically incorrect: $CO$ protein is stabilized by light at dusk, so enrichment should be maximal at ZT $16$ in LD, not lower. Furthermore, a large difference in binding is expected between LD ZT $16$ and SD ZT $16$, contrary to what is stated. The EMSA design is incomplete as it lacks both competition and supershift controls, which are essential for demonstrating the specificity of the interaction. **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, Option A is the only choice that describes a scientifically rigorous, internally consistent, and complete experimental plan with all the necessary controls to properly test the hypothesis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2569042"}]}
