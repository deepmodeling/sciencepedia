It describes a standard genetic experiment using double mutant analysis to infer a signaling pathway structure, a common practice in molecular genetics and plant biology. The provided data, genetic principles, and biological components ($MAX4$, $D14$, $MAX2$, $BRC1$) are consistent with established knowledge of strigolactone (SL) signaling in *Arabidopsis thaliana*. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe central task is to evaluate five inferences based on the provided experimental data and two guiding principles. The strigolactone pathway is stated to suppress axillary bud outgrowth, meaning a higher bud outgrowth index ($B$) corresponds to a weaker pathway activity (a loss-of-function phenotype). The canonical pathway order is biosynthesis ($MAX4$), perception ($D14$), transduction ($MAX2$), and transcriptional response ($BRC1$).\n\nLet's analyze the phenotypes for bud outgrowth ($B$). The wild-type ($WT$) has a mock $B$ of $1.0$. The loss-of-function mutants show increased branching: $max4$ ($B=3.0$), $d14$ ($B=3.2$), $max2$ ($B=4.0$), and $brc1$ ($B=2.5$). The synthetic strigolactone GR24 rescues the biosynthesis mutant $max4$ (from $B=3.0$ to $B=1.2$) but not the perception/transduction mutants $d14$ (from $B=3.2$ to $B=3.1$) or $max2$ (from $B=4.0$ to $B=3.9$), consistent with principle (ii) and the canonical pathway functions.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. MAX$4$ functions upstream of D$14$ in the same linear pathway for shoot branching control, with D$14$ epistatic to MAX$4$ for axillary bud suppression.**\nTo test this, we examine the $max4 \\ d14$ double mutant. According to principle (i), in a linear pathway, the phenotype of a double mutant resembles the phenotype of the single mutant corresponding to the downstream gene.\n- Single mutant $max4$ phenotype ($B$, mock): $3.0$.\n- Single mutant $d14$ phenotype ($B$, mock): $3.2$.\n- Double mutant $max4 \\ d14$ phenotype ($B$, mock): $3.1$.\nThe double mutant phenotype ($B=3.1$) is nearly identical to the $d14$ single mutant phenotype ($B=3.2$) and distinct from the $max4$ single mutant phenotype ($B=3.0$). This indicates that the $d14$ mutation is epistatic to the $max4$ mutation. Based on principle (i), this places $D14$ downstream of $MAX4$ in a linear pathway. This conclusion is further supported by the GR24 response data where the external ligand bypasses the $max4$ defect but not the $d14$ defect. Therefore, the statement is fully supported by the data.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. D$14$ and MAX$4$ act in parallel, independent pathways that converge on axillary bud growth, rather than a single linear pathway.**\nIf $MAX4$ and $D14$ acted in two parallel pathways that both suppress bud outgrowth, a double mutant ($max4 \\ d14$) would be expected to show an additive or synergistic phenotype, meaning a more severe loss of suppression (higher $B$ value) than either single mutant. The data are: $max4$ ($B=3.0$), $d14$ ($B=3.2$), and $max4 \\ d14$ ($B=3.1$). The double mutant phenotype is not more severe than the $d14$ single mutant. Instead, it demonstrates epistasis, which is the hallmark of a linear pathway. This statement is directly contradicted by the epistasis analysis in A.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. MAX$2$ acts entirely downstream of BRC$1$ in a single linear pathway controlling branching; therefore, brc$1$ should be epistatic to max$2$.**\nThis statement contains an internal contradiction. According to principle (i), if $MAX2$ acts downstream of $BRC1$, then the $max2$ mutation should be epistatic to the $brc1$ mutation, meaning the $max2 \\ brc1$ double mutant should have the $max2$ phenotype. The statement claims that \"therefore, $brc1$ should be epistatic to $max2$,\" which is the opposite of the conclusion that follows from its own premise. Checking the data confirms the premise part:\n- Single mutant $max2$ phenotype ($B$, mock): $4.0$.\n- Single mutant $brc1$ phenotype ($B$, mock): $2.5$.\n- Double mutant $max2 \\ brc1$ phenotype ($B$, mock): $4.0$.\nThe double mutant phenotype is identical to the $max2$ single mutant phenotype. Thus, $max2$ is indeed epistatic to $brc1$, which (by principle(i)) implies $MAX2$ is downstream of $BRC1$. However, the option's conclusion (\"therefore, $brc1$ should be epistatic\") is logically false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The strigolactone signal bifurcates downstream of MAX$2$: one branch requires BRANCHED $1$ (BRC$1$) to suppress bud outgrowth, while another branch suppresses bud outgrowth independently of BRC$1$, explaining the stronger max$2$ phenotype and the max$2$ brc$1$ epistasis.**\nThis option proposes a branched pathway model: $MAX2$ activates two downstream branches, one dependent on $BRC1$ and another independent of $BRC1$. Let's test this model against the data.\n- **Phenotype severity**: If $MAX2$ controls two parallel suppressive branches, a $max2$ mutation would disable both, leading to a very strong phenotype. A $brc1$ mutation would only disable one branch, leading to a weaker, intermediate phenotype. The data shows $B_{max2} = 4.0$ and $B_{brc1} = 2.5$, which is consistent with this prediction ($max2$ is more severe than $brc1$).\n- **Epistasis**: In such a branched pathway, a mutation in the upstream component ($max2$) would be epistatic to a mutation in one of the downstream branches ($brc1$). This is because knocking out $MAX2$ eliminates the entire signal, making the status of the downstream component $BRC1$ irrelevant. The phenotype of the $max2 \\ brc1$ double mutant should thus be identical to that of the $max2$ single mutant. The data shows exactly this: $B_{max2 \\ brc1} = 4.0$ and $B_{max2} = 4.0$.\nThis branched model elegantly explains both the relative severity of the single mutant phenotypes and the observed epistasis, resolving the apparent contradiction with a simple linear model where $BRC1$ is typically placed downstream of $MAX2$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Strigolactone biosynthesis via MAX$4$ is unnecessary for mycorrhizal hyphal branching; instead, D$14$ in roots is essential for producing exudate activity that stimulates AMF hyphae.**\nThis statement concerns the AMF hyphal branching index ($H$), which measures the activity of root exudates. Strigolactones are known to be exuded from roots to stimulate AMF.\n- **Role of MAX4**: $MAX4$ is a biosynthetic enzyme. A $max4$ mutant should fail to produce strigolactones. The data shows that exudate from WT plants has an activity $H=1.0$, whereas exudate from $max4$ mutants has a much lower activity of $H=0.2$. This demonstrates that biosynthesis via $MAX4$ is, in fact, necessary for producing the stimulatory compound in the exudate. The first part of the statement is false.\n- **Role of D14**: $D14$ is an intracellular receptor. It should be required for the plant to respond to strigolactones, but not for their synthesis and exudation. The data shows that exudate from the $d14$ mutant has an activity $H=1.0$, identical to WT. This shows that $D14$ is *not* essential for producing the active exudate. The second part of the statement is also false.\nBoth claims in this option are directly contradicted by the data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2610918"}, {"introduction": "While genetic analyses reveal the static wiring diagram of a pathway, a biophysical approach is required to understand its dynamics.
