A solution will now be derived from first principles.\n\nThe task is to determine the minimal amount of ATP required to sequester a specified amount of $Na^+$ ions. This is a problem of stoichiometric coupling between two transport processes. Let $N_{Na^+}$ be the amount of sodium ions sequestered, $N_{H^+, NHX}$ be the amount of protons transported by the NHX antiporter, $N_{H^+, V-ATPase}$ be the amount of protons transported by the V-ATPase, and $N_{ATP}$ be the amount of ATP consumed.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n$N_{Na^+} = 1 \\text{ mmol}$.\n\nThe sequestration of $Na^+$ is mediated by the NHX antiporter. The stoichiometry of this exchange is given as $1:1$. This means that for every 1 mole of $Na^+$ transported into the vacuole, 1 mole of $H^+$ must be transported out of the vacuole.\nTherefore, the amount of $H^+$ transported by NHX, $N_{H^+, NHX}$, is directly proportional to the amount of $Na^+$ sequestered:\n$$ \\frac{N_{H^+, NHX}}{N_{Na^+}} = \\frac{1}{1} $$\n$$ N_{H^+, NHX} = N_{Na^+} = 1 \\text{ mmol} $$\nThis transport of $H^+$ is from the vacuole to the cytosol.\n\nThe problem states that a steady state is maintained and proton leak is negligible. This implies that the net change in the amount of $H^+$ in the vacuole due to these transport processes is zero. The $H^+$ exported from the vacuole by NHX must be replenished by being pumped back into the vacuole by the V-ATPase. This is a direct application of the principle of conservation of mass for the proton fluxes at steady state.\n$$ N_{H^+, V-ATPase} = N_{H^+, NHX} $$\nThus, the V-ATPase must pump $1 \\text{ mmol}$ of $H^+$ into the vacuole.\n$$ N_{H^+, V-ATPase} = 1 \\text{ mmol} $$\n\nThe V-ATPase is a primary active transporter that consumes ATP to drive this proton flux. The stoichiometry of the V-ATPase is given as 3 $H^+$ ions translocated into the vacuole for every 1 molecule of ATP hydrolyzed. This gives us the ratio of protons transported to ATP consumed:\n$$ \\frac{N_{H^+, V-ATPase}}{N_{ATP}} = \\frac{3}{1} $$\n\nWe need to find $N_{ATP}$, the amount of ATP consumed. We can rearrange the stoichiometric equation for the V-ATPase to solve for $N_{ATP}$:\n$$ N_{ATP} = \\frac{N_{H^+, V-ATPase}}{3} $$\n\nSubstituting the value we found for $N_{H^+, V-ATPase}$:\n$$ N_{ATP} = \\frac{1 \\text{ mmol}}{3} $$\n\nTherefore, the minimal ATP consumption required to sequester 1 mmol of $Na^+$ into the vacuole under the specified conditions is $\\frac{1}{3}$ mmol.
