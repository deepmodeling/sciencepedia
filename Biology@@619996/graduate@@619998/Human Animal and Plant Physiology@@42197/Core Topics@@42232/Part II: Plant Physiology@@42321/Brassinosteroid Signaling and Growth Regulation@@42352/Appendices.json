The provided data, including dissociation constants and ligand concentrations, are physically realistic for a biological hormone signaling system. The problem is well-posed; it provides all necessary constants and simplifying assumptions (e.g., negligible receptor concentration, mutually exclusive binding) required to determine a unique, stable, and meaningful solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution will be provided.\n\nThe system under consideration involves a receptor, which we denote as $R$, and two competing ligands, brassinolide ($BL$) and castasterone ($CS$). The binding of these ligands to the receptor is reversible and mutually exclusive. The chemical equilibria are described by the law of mass action.\n\nThe equilibrium for the binding of brassinolide to the receptor is:\n$$R + BL \\rightleftharpoons R\\text{-}BL$$\nwhere $R\\text{-}BL$ is the receptor-ligand complex. The equilibrium dissociation constant for this reaction, denoted $K_{d,BL}$, is defined as:\n$$K_{d,BL} = \\frac{[R][BL]}{[R\\text{-}BL]}$$\nHere, $[R]$, $[BL]$, and $[R\\text{-}BL]$ represent the molar concentrations of the free receptor, free brassinolide, and the receptor-brassinolide complex at equilibrium, respectively.\n\nSimilarly, the equilibrium for the binding of castasterone is:\n$$R + CS \\rightleftharpoons R\\text{-}CS$$\nThe corresponding equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_{d,CS}$, is:\n$$K_{d,CS} = \\frac{[R][CS]}{[R\\text{-}CS]}$$\nwhere $[CS]$ is the concentration of free castasterone and $[R\\text{-}CS]$ is the concentration of the receptor-castasterone complex.\n\nThe objective is to find the ratio of BRI1 receptors occupied by BL to those occupied by CS, which is the ratio of the concentrations of the two complexes, $\\frac{[R\\text{-}BL]}{[R\\text{-}CS]}$.\n\nTo derive this ratio, we first rearrange the expressions for the dissociation constants to solve for the concentrations of the occupied receptor complexes.\nFor the BL-occupied receptor:\n$$[R\\text{-}BL] = \\frac{[R][BL]}{K_{d,BL}}$$\nFor the CS-occupied receptor:\n$$[R\\text{-}CS] = \\frac{[R][CS]}{K_{d,CS}}$$\n\nNow, we construct the desired ratio by dividing the expression for $[R\\text{-}BL]$ by the expression for $[R\\text{-}CS]$:\n$$\\frac{[R\\text{-}BL]}{[R\\text{-}CS]} = \\frac{\\frac{[R][BL]}{K_{d,BL}}}{\\frac{[R][CS]}{K_{d,CS}}}$$\n\nThe concentration of the free receptor, $[R]$, is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator, and thus it cancels out. This simplification is crucial and is valid as long as $[R]$ is not zero, which must be true in any non-trivial equilibrium state.\n$$\\frac{[R\\text{-}BL]}{[R\\text{-}CS]} = \\frac{[BL]}{K_{d,BL}} \\cdot \\frac{K_{d,CS}}{[CS]}$$\nRearranging the terms gives the final symbolic expression for the ratio:\n$$\\frac{[R\\text{-}BL]}{[R\\text{-}CS]} = \\frac{[BL]}{[CS]} \\cdot \\frac{K_{d,CS}}{K_{d,BL}}$$\nThis expression demonstrates that the relative occupancy of the receptor by two competing ligands depends on the ratio of their concentrations and the inverse ratio of their affinities (where higher affinity corresponds to a lower $K_d$).\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into this derived expression. The problem states:\n$[\\mathrm{BL}] = 5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$[\\mathrm{CS}] = 5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$K_{d}^{\\mathrm{BRI1}}(\\mathrm{BL}) = K_{d,BL} = 1\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$K_{d}^{\\mathrm{BRI1}}(\\mathrm{CS}) = K_{d,CS} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n\nThe assumption that ligand depletion is negligible means we can use these total concentrations as the free ligand concentrations at equilibrium.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\\frac{[R\\text{-}BL]}{[R\\text{-}CS]} = \\frac{5\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{5\\,\\mathrm{nM}} \\cdot \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{1\\,\\mathrm{nM}}$$\nThe concentration units ($\\mathrm{nM}$) cancel out, yielding a dimensionless number, as required.\n$$\\frac{[R\\text{-}BL]}{[R\\text{-}CS]} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{10}{1} = 10$$\nThus, at equilibrium under the specified conditions, there are $10$ times more receptors occupied by brassinolide than by castasterone. This is expected, as brassinolide has a $10$-fold higher affinity for the receptor ($K_{d,BL}$ is $10$ times smaller than $K_{d,CS}$), while both ligands are present at the same concentration.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{10}\n$$", "id": "2553019"}, {"introduction": "A cell's sensitivity to a hormone is not fixed; it is dynamically regulated to fine-tune signaling output and prevent runaway responses.

In wild type, these E3 ligases physically associate with the BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (*BRI1*) receptor kinase at the plasma membrane and catalyze ubiquitin attachment on *BRI1*, which marks the receptor for endocytic removal and subsequent vacuolar degradation. The biologist applies a brief pulse of brassinolide to synchronize receptor activation and then monitors the time-course of downstream brassinosteroid output signaling, as well as steady-state surface levels of *BRI1*. Independently, because *PUB12*/*13* have documented roles in pattern-recognition receptor quality control in innate immunity, the biologist also measures Flagellin Sensing 2 (*FLS2*) turnover after flg22 treatment in the same *pub12 pub13* background.\n\nUsing only fundamental principles about membrane receptor turnover and the ubiquitin system, and reasoning from first principles about how removal of a ubiquitin ligase affects the balance between receptor synthesis and degradation, choose the single most plausible integrated prediction about:\n- *BRI1* abundance at steady state at the plasma membrane,\n- the duration of brassinosteroid signaling after a ligand pulse,\n- and the direction of change in immune receptor (e.g., *FLS2*) turnover.\n\nWhich option best fits these predictions?\n\nA.

Loss of *PUB12*/*13* increases surface *BRI1* by reducing ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis, prolongs brassinosteroid signaling after the pulse due to slower receptor downregulation, and decreases *FLS2* turnover (i.e., stabilizes *FLS2*) by removing a major ubiquitination route.\n\nC. Loss of *PUB12*/*13* leaves surface *BRI1* unchanged due to compensatory autophagy, shortens brassinosteroid signaling because internalization is needed for productive signaling, and leaves *FLS2* turnover unchanged.\n\nD. Loss of *PUB12*/*13* increases surface *BRI1* but shortens brassinosteroid signaling because endosomes are the main signaling platforms, and increases *FLS2* turnover via induction of alternative E3 ligases.", "solution": "We proceed from fundamental principles relevant to membrane receptor biology in plants:\n\n- Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification in which ubiquitin is covalently attached to target proteins by an E1–E2–E3 enzymatic cascade. For many plasma membrane receptors in plants, polyubiquitination, often via lysine-63-linked chains, signals clathrin-mediated endocytosis and sorting to the vacuole for degradation. Thus, ubiquitination increases the effective first-order rate of receptor removal from the plasma membrane and degradation.\n\n- Receptor abundance dynamics can be captured by a mass-balance between synthesis and loss. Let $R(t)$ denote the number of functional receptors at the plasma membrane at time $t$. Let $p$ denote the synthesis/insertion rate and $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$ the effective first-order rate constant for removal (via endocytosis and degradation), so that\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} \\;=\\; p \\;-\\; k_{\\mathrm{deg}}\\,R.\n$$\nAt steady state, where $\\frac{dR}{dt} = 0$, the solution is $R_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{p}{k_{\\mathrm{deg}}}$.\n\n- Removal of an E3 ligase that ubiquitinates the receptor reduces the ubiquitination-dependent contribution to $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$. Let $k_{\\mathrm{deg}} = k_{0} + k_{\\mathrm{ub}}$, where $k_{0}$ accounts for ubiquitin-independent loss and $k_{\\mathrm{ub}}$ depends on E3 activity. In the *pub12 pub13* mutant, $k_{\\mathrm{ub}}$ decreases toward $0$, so $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$ decreases. Therefore, $R_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{p}{k_{0} + k_{\\mathrm{ub}}}$ increases when $k_{\\mathrm{ub}}$ decreases. Hence, surface *BRI1* should accumulate.\n\n- For signaling duration after a ligand pulse, consider ligand $L$ and receptor $R$ forming occupied complexes $RL$ that drive signaling. If the receptor is downregulated primarily by ubiquitination-triggered endocytosis/degradation, then the time constant for signal decay includes a term proportional to $1/k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$; slowing down receptor removal (decreasing $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$) prolongs the availability of $R$ and $RL$, thereby prolonging the integrated signaling output after a pulse. Formally, if $S(t) \\propto RL(t)$ and $RL(t)$ decays approximately as $\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{eff}} t)$ with $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ incorporating receptor downregulation and ligand dissociation, then decreasing the receptor downregulation component reduces $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and extends the duration over which $S(t)$ remains above a threshold.\n\n- For immune receptor turnover, *PUB12* and *PUB13* have established roles in ubiquitinating pattern-recognition receptors such as *FLS2* following activation, which promotes their endocytosis and degradation. Removing these E3 ligases would be expected to slow *FLS2* ubiquitination and thereby reduce its turnover rate, increasing its half-life and stabilizing the receptor at or near the plasma membrane and early endosomes after elicitor treatment.\n\nPutting these principles together yields the integrated prediction: higher steady-state *BRI1* abundance at the plasma membrane, longer brassinosteroid signaling duration after a ligand pulse, and decreased turnover (stabilization) of immune receptors like *FLS2*.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\n- Option A: It asserts that loss of *PUB12*/*13* decreases surface *BRI1* due to impaired recycling. This contradicts the mass-balance prediction: reducing ubiquitination lowers $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$ and should increase $R_{\\mathrm{ss}}$. Recycling is typically promoted by deubiquitination; loss of an E3 would not impair recycling but would impair ubiquitin-dependent internalization. It also predicts shortened signaling, which conflicts with the expected prolonged signaling due to slower downregulation. It further claims accelerated *FLS2* turnover, whereas loss of the E3 that ubiquitinates *FLS2* should reduce, not increase, turnover. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- Option B: It states that loss of *PUB12*/*13* increases surface *BRI1* by reducing ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis, prolongs brassinosteroid signaling after the pulse due to slower receptor downregulation, and decreases *FLS2* turnover by removing a major ubiquitination route. This aligns with the kinetics argument and known roles of *PUB12*/*13* in receptor ubiquitination. Verdict: Correct.\n\n- Option C: It proposes unchanged *BRI1* abundance due to compensatory autophagy, shortened signaling because internalization is needed for productive signaling, and unchanged *FLS2* turnover. While endosomal signaling can contribute to signaling in some systems, in this context the dominant effect of reducing ubiquitination is to decrease $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$ and increase $R_{\\mathrm{ss}}$, not to leave it unchanged. Moreover, compensatory autophagy would not specifically target the plasma membrane receptor without ubiquitin tags; thus, unchanged turnover is unlikely. The claim of shortened signaling is inconsistent with reduced downregulation. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- Option D: It notes increased surface *BRI1* (consistent), but then asserts shortened signaling because endosomes are the main signaling platforms. Although endosomal signaling can exist, reducing receptor downregulation typically prolongs signaling by maintaining receptor availability; there is no general rule that endosomal localization is the exclusive signaling site for *BRI1* sufficient to overcome the effect of stabilizing receptors at the plasma membrane. Finally, it predicts increased *FLS2* turnover via induction of alternative E3 ligases; while compensatory mechanisms may exist, the immediate and direct effect of removing *PUB12*/*13* is to reduce *FLS2* ubiquitination and turnover, not to increase it. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the single most plausible integrated prediction consistent with first principles of receptor ubiquitination and turnover.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2553030"}, {"introduction": "Hormone signaling pathways are embedded within a larger network of cellular machinery, and their outputs are integrated with other signals to orchestrate complex physiological processes like growth.

This initiates a signaling cascade resulting in:\n    a. **Rapid (non-genomic) responses:** Post-translational modification of existing proteins, such as the plasma membrane $\\mathrm{H^+}$-ATPase, leading to its activation. This occurs within minutes.\n    b. **Long-term (genomic) responses:** Changes in gene expression via transcription factors, regulating development over hours to days.\n2.  **Fusicoccin (FC) Action:** FC acts as a direct molecular glue, stabilizing the active complex between the plasma membrane $\\mathrm{H^+}$-ATPase and 14-3-3 proteins. This bypasses receptor-level signaling.\n3.  **Acid Growth Hypothesis:** Activation of the $\\mathrm{H^+}$-ATPase leads to proton ($\\mathrm{H^+}$) efflux, acidifying the apoplast (cell wall space). This lower pH activates wall-loosening enzymes, increasing wall extensibility and promoting cell elongation under turgor pressure.\n4.  **Inhibitor Actions:**\n    a. **Cycloheximide (CHX):** Inhibits cytosolic protein synthesis. It will block genomic responses but not rapid, non-genomic responses that rely on pre-existing proteins.\n    b. **Sodium Orthovanadate:** A specific inhibitor of P-type ATPases, including the plasma membrane $\\mathrm{H^+}$-ATPase.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n**A. In wild type, both BL and FC will cause a rapid apoplastic acidification and a measurable increase in elongation within $\\leq 15$ min that persist in the presence of CHX; however, only BL requires *BRI1*-dependent signaling for these rapid responses, whereas FC does not.**\n\n- **Analysis:**\n    - Both BL (via its rapid, non-genomic pathway) and FC (via direct stabilization) activate the $\\mathrm{H^+}$-ATPase. According to the acid growth hypothesis, this leads to rapid acidification and elongation, reasonably within $15$ minutes.\n    - Since these rapid responses rely on the modification or stabilization of pre-existing protein complexes (the $\\mathrm{H^+}$-ATPase and its regulators), they do not require new protein synthesis. Therefore, they should be insensitive to the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX.\n    - BL's action is explicitly stated to originate from the *BRI1* receptor. FC's action is defined as bypassing the receptor. Thus, *BRI1* is required for the BL response but not the FC response.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. The prediction aligns perfectly with all given principles.\n\n**B. Vanadate will abolish FC-induced acidification and growth and strongly reduce the rapid BL-induced acidification, indicating that both responses depend on the activity of the plasma membrane $\\mathrm{H^+}$-ATPase.**\n\n- **Analysis:**\n    - Both BL and FC are proposed to cause acidification by activating the plasma membrane $\\mathrm{H^+}$-ATPase.\n    - Vanadate is an inhibitor of this specific type of pump.\n    - Therefore, vanadate should block the activity of the pump regardless of how it was activated. This means it will inhibit the effects of both FC and BL. FC's effect will be abolished as it has no other target. BL's rapid effect, being mediated by the pump, will be strongly reduced or abolished.\n    - The conclusion that both responses depend on the $\\mathrm{H^+}$-ATPase is the correct inference from this predicted result.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. This prediction correctly tests the convergence point of the two pathways using a specific inhibitor.\n\n**C. In the *bri1* mutant, FC will fail to stimulate elongation but BL will still promote rapid acidification via a non-genomic route, demonstrating that *BRI1* is dispensable for BL’s early effects.**\n\n- **Analysis:**\n    - A *bri1* loss-of-function mutant lacks the receptor for BL. Therefore, BL will be unable to trigger its signaling cascade, and no acidification or growth should occur. The statement that BL will still promote acidification is false.\n    - FC bypasses the receptor and acts directly on the $\\mathrm{H^+}$-ATPase. Therefore, FC *should* stimulate elongation in the *bri1* mutant, as the downstream machinery is intact.

The predictions for both FC and BL in the *bri1* mutant are the opposite of what the provided principles dictate.\n\n**D. FC and BL both converge on the activation state of the $\\mathrm{H^+}$-ATPase, but BL requires prior transcriptional upregulation of $\\mathrm{H^+}$-ATPase genes before any pump activation can occur, whereas FC stabilizes the phosphorylated $\\mathrm{H^+}$-ATPase–14-3-3 complex regardless of upstream kinase activity.**\n\n- **Analysis:**\n    - The statement incorrectly asserts that BL's action on the pump *requires* prior transcriptional upregulation. The problem explicitly states that hormone signaling involves *rapid* responses via modification of *pre-existing proteins* (non-genomic) as well as slower transcriptional responses. The rapid acidification observed within minutes cannot be due to transcription and translation, which is a much slower process. BL activates pre-existing pumps.\n    - The first part of the statement (\"FC and BL both converge on...\") is correct, but the reason given for BL's action is fundamentally wrong in the context of a rapid response.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect. This option misrepresents the mechanism of rapid hormone action, conflating it with the long-term genomic response.\n\n**E. Even if FC and BL are matched for the magnitude of rapid apoplastic acidification, only BL is expected to reorient cortical microtubules and alter cellulose synthase trajectories over hours via signaling to transcription factors (for example, *BZR1*/*BES1*), resulting in divergent longer-term growth patterns that FC does not reproduce.**\n\n- **Analysis:**\n    - This option correctly distinguishes between the immediate effect (acid growth) and the complex, long-term developmental effects of a hormone.\n    - BL, as a steroid hormone, regulates a wide array of developmental processes, including the organization of the cytoskeleton and cell wall synthesis machinery. These effects are part of its long-term, genomic program, mediated by transcription factors like *BZR1*/*BES1*, as stated in the \"Hormone signaling logic\".\n    - FC is a toxin with a highly specific mode of action: direct activation of the $\\mathrm{H^+}$-ATPase. It does not engage the complex upstream signaling network of BL and is therefore not expected to reproduce the full suite of long-term developmental changes.\n    - This prediction accurately captures the difference between a specific effector (FC) and a pleiotropic signaling molecule (BL).\n- **Verdict:** Correct. The statement accurately describes the expected divergence in long-term effects based on the distinct mechanisms of action.\n\n**F. Auxin co-treatment will synergize with BL but antagonize FC on acidification because both converge on protein phosphatase 2C of clade D (PP2C-D) and therefore compete for the same phosphatase pool, reducing FC efficacy in the presence of auxin.**\n\n- **Analysis:**\n    - The problem statement and its fundamental bases provide no information whatsoever about \"auxin\" or \"protein phosphatase 2C of clade D (PP2C-D)\".\n    - The solution must be derived strictly from the information given.
