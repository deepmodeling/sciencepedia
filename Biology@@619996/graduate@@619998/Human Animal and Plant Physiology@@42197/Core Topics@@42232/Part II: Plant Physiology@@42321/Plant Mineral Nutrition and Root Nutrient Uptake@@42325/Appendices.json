It is a valid problem. Proceeding to solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem must be solved starting from Fick's first law and the principle of mass conservation at steady state in cylindrical coordinates.\n\nLet $C(r)$ be the phosphate concentration in the soil solution at a radial distance $r$ from the center of the root. Fick's first law gives the radial diffusive flux density, $\\mathcal{F}_{r}$ (amount per unit area per unit time), as:\n$$ \\mathcal{F}_{r} = -D_{\\mathrm{e}} \\frac{dC}{dr} $$\nwhere $D_{\\mathrm{e}}$ is the effective diffusion coefficient in the soil.\n\nFor steady-state mass conservation with only radial diffusion and no sources or sinks in the soil medium itself, the divergence of the flux density must be zero. In cylindrical coordinates, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{dr}(r \\mathcal{F}_{r}) = 0 $$\nThis implies that the quantity $r \\mathcal{F}_{r}$ is a constant. Let's call this constant $K$:\n$$ r \\mathcal{F}_{r} = r \\left(-D_{\\mathrm{e}} \\frac{dC}{dr}\\right) = K $$\nThe total influx per unit length of the root, $J$, is the total amount of phosphate crossing a cylindrical surface of radius $r$ and unit length, per unit time. The direction of influx is opposite to the radial unit vector.\n$$ J = - (2\\pi r \\times 1) \\mathcal{F}_{r} = -2\\pi (r \\mathcal{F}_{r}) = -2\\pi K $$\nSince $J$ is the influx, it is a positive quantity, meaning phosphate flows towards the root at $r=0$. The concentration $C(r)$ must therefore increase with $r$, so $\\frac{dC}{dr} > 0$. This implies $\\mathcal{F}_{r}$ is negative, and $K$ is negative. Let's define $J = 2\\pi r D_{\\mathrm{e}} \\frac{dC}{dr}$. Since the influx $J$ is constant at steady state, we can write the governing ordinary differential equation for $C(r)$:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dr} = \\frac{J}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\frac{1}{r} $$\nThis equation is separable. We integrate it with respect to $r$:\n$$ \\int dC = \\frac{J}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\int \\frac{1}{r} dr $$\nThis yields the general solution for the concentration profile:\n$$ C(r) = \\frac{J}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\ln(r) + A $$\nwhere $A$ is the constant of integration.\n\nTo find the specific solution, we apply the two boundary conditions. Let $r_{\\text{abs}}$ be the radius of the absorbing surface.\n1. At the outer boundary, $r=R$, the concentration is $C_{0}$:\n   $$ C(R) = C_{0} = \\frac{J}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\ln(R) + A $$\n2. At the absorbing surface, $r=r_{\\text{abs}}$, the concentration is zero (perfect sink):\n   $$ C(r_{\\text{abs}}) = 0 = \\frac{J}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\ln(r_{\\text{abs}}) + A $$\n\nWe solve this system for the two unknowns, $J$ and $A$. Subtracting the second equation from the first gives:\n$$ C_{0} - 0 = \\left(\\frac{J}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\ln(R) + A\\right) - \\left(\\frac{J}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\ln(r_{\\text{abs}}) + A\\right) $$\n$$ C_{0} = \\frac{J}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} (\\ln(R) - \\ln(r_{\\text{abs}})) = \\frac{J}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_{\\text{abs}}}\\right) $$\nSolving for the influx per unit length, $J$:\n$$ J = \\frac{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}} C_{0}}{\\ln(R/r_{\\text{abs}})} $$\nThis is the derived expression for the steady diffusive influx per unit root length.\n\nTo find the concentration profile $C(r)$, we first find $A$ from the second boundary condition: $A = -\\frac{J}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\ln(r_{\\text{abs}})$. Substituting this into the general solution:\n$$ C(r) = \\frac{J}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\ln(r) - \\frac{J}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\ln(r_{\\text{abs}}) = \\frac{J}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r}{r_{\\text{abs}}}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $J$ gives the final form for the concentration profile:\n$$ C(r) = \\frac{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}} C_{0}}{\\ln(R/r_{\\text{abs}})} \\frac{1}{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r}{r_{\\text{abs}}}\\right) = C_{0} \\frac{\\ln(r/r_{\\text{abs}})}{\\ln(R/r_{\\text{abs}})} $$\nThese are the general derivations for influx and concentration profile, as requested.\n\nNow, we apply these results to the two genotypes.\nFor the wild type (wt), the absorbing radius is $r_{\\text{abs}} = r_{\\mathrm{wt}} = r_{\\mathrm{r}} + L_{\\mathrm{h}}$. The influx is:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{wt}} = \\frac{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}} C_{0}}{\\ln(R/r_{\\mathrm{wt}})} = \\frac{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}} C_{0}}{\\ln(R/(r_{\\mathrm{r}} + L_{\\mathrm{h}}))} $$\nFor the mutant (mut), the absorbing radius is $r_{\\text{abs}} = r_{\\mathrm{mut}} = r_{\\mathrm{r}}$. The influx is:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{mut}} = \\frac{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}} C_{0}}{\\ln(R/r_{\\mathrm{mut}})} = \\frac{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}} C_{0}}{\\ln(R/r_{\\mathrm{r}})} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the fractional reduction in uptake, $\\Delta$:\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{wt}} - J_{\\mathrm{mut}}}{J_{\\mathrm{wt}}} = 1 - \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{mut}}}{J_{\\mathrm{wt}}} $$\nWe compute the ratio $\\frac{J_{\\mathrm{mut}}}{J_{\\mathrm{wt}}}$:\n$$ \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{mut}}}{J_{\\mathrm{wt}}} = \\frac{\\frac{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}} C_{0}}{\\ln(R/r_{\\mathrm{r}})}}{\\frac{2\\pi D_{\\mathrm{e}} C_{0}}{\\ln(R/(r_{\\mathrm{r}} + L_{\\mathrm{h}}))}} = \\frac{\\ln(R/(r_{\\mathrm{r}} + L_{\\mathrm{h}}))}{\\ln(R/r_{\\mathrm{r}})} $$\nNote that the physical parameters $D_{\\mathrm{e}}$ and $C_{0}$ cancel, so the fractional reduction depends only on the geometry of the system.\nSubstituting this ratio back into the expression for $\\Delta$:\n$$ \\Delta = 1 - \\frac{\\ln(R/(r_{\\mathrm{r}} + L_{\\mathrm{h}}))}{\\ln(R/r_{\\mathrm{r}})} $$\n\nNow, a numerical calculation is performed using the provided values.

I will proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Proliferation Rate Ratio $R$\n\nThe derivation will proceed by constructing each component of the model as defined in the problem statement. For any given root zone $i \\in \\{A, B\\}$, the following expressions are derived.\n\n1.  **Local Nitrate Stimulation Factor ($f_{stim, i}$)**: This is an increasing rectangular-hyperbola function of local nitrate $N_i$ with half-saturation $K_g$.\n    $$ f_{\\mathrm{stim}, i} = \\frac{N_i}{K_g + N_i} $$\n\n2.  **Local Cytokinin Production Rate ($P_i$)**: This is a saturating function of local nitrate $N_i$ with amplitude $k_p$ and half-saturation $K_p$.\n    $$ P_i = k_p \\frac{N_i}{K_p + N_i} $$\n\n3.  **Systemic Cytokinin Concentration ($C_{\\mathrm{sys}}$)**: At steady state, this is proportional to the sum of local production rates from all zones, with proportionality constant $\\theta$.\n    $$ C_{\\mathrm{sys}} = \\theta (P_A + P_B) $$\n    Substituting the expressions for $P_A$ and $P_B$:\n    $$ C_{\\mathrm{sys}} = \\theta k_p \\left( \\frac{N_A}{K_p + N_A} + \\frac{N_B}{K_p + N_B} \\right) $$\n\n4.  **Local Sensitivity to Cytokinin Inhibition ($S_i$)**: This sensitivity decreases with local nitrate $N_i$ according to a rectangular-hyperbola form with half-saturation $K_s$. A standard representation for such a decreasing function is:\n    $$ S_i = \\frac{K_s}{K_s + N_i} $$\n    This function has a maximum value of $1$ when $N_i = 0$ and approaches $0$ for large $N_i$.\n\n5.  **Local Proliferation Inhibition Factor ($f_{\\mathrm{inhib}, i}$)**: This factor decreases with the product of systemic cytokinin $C_{\\mathrm{sys}}$, local sensitivity $S_i$, and the inhibition strength parameter $\\alpha$. A simple decreasing function consistent with the hyperbolic forms used throughout the model is:\n    $$ f_{\\mathrm{inhib}, i} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha C_{\\mathrm{sys}} S_i} $$\n    Substituting the expression for $S_i$:\n    $$ f_{\\mathrm{inhib}, i} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha C_{\\mathrm{sys}} \\frac{K_s}{K_s + N_i}} $$\n\n6.  **Local Instantaneous Proliferation Rate ($g_i$)**: This is the product of the maximal proliferation rate $g_{\\max}$, the local nitrate stimulation factor, and the local inhibition factor.\n    $$ g_i = g_{\\max} \\cdot f_{\\mathrm{stim}, i} \\cdot f_{\\mathrm{inhib}, i} $$\n    Substituting the derived expressions for each factor:\n    $$ g_i = g_{\\max} \\left( \\frac{N_i}{K_g + N_i} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha C_{\\mathrm{sys}} \\frac{K_s}{K_s + N_i}} \\right) $$\n\n7.  **Ratio of Proliferation Rates ($R$)**: The primary task is to find the ratio $R = g_B / g_A$.\n    $$ R = \\frac{g_B}{g_A} = \\frac{g_{\\max} \\left( \\frac{N_B}{K_g + N_B} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha C_{\\mathrm{sys}} \\frac{K_s}{K_s + N_B}} \\right)}{g_{\\max} \\left( \\frac{N_A}{K_g + N_A} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha C_{\\mathrm{sys}} \\frac{K_s}{K_s + N_A}} \\right)} $$\n    The maximal proliferation rate $g_{\\max}$ cancels out. The expression can be separated into a ratio of stimulation terms and a ratio of inhibition terms.\n    $$ R = \\left( \\frac{N_B/(K_g + N_B)}{N_A/(K_g + N_A)} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1 / (1 + \\alpha C_{\\mathrm{sys}} \\frac{K_s}{K_s + N_B})}{1 / (1 + \\alpha C_{\\mathrm{sys}} \\frac{K_s}{K_s + N_A})} \\right) $$\n    Simplifying the fractions gives the final explicit expression for $R$:\n    $$ R = \\left( \\frac{N_B}{N_A} \\frac{K_g + N_A}{K_g + N_B} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1 + \\alpha C_{\\mathrm{sys}} \\frac{K_s}{K_s + N_A}}{1 + \\alpha C_{\\mathrm{sys}} \\frac{K_s}{K_s + N_B}} \\right) $$\n    where $C_{\\mathrm{sys}}$ is given by the expression derived in step $3$. This expression for $R$ is solely in terms of the specified parameters $(N_{\\mathrm{A}}, N_{\\mathrm{B}}, K_{g}, K_{p}, k_{p}, \\theta, K_{s}, \\alpha)$, as required. This completes the first task. The second and third tasks involve implementing this formula numerically.", "answer": "[0.0785,1.0000,1.0000,0.1833,0.0152]", "id": "2598611"}]}
