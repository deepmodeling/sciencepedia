The problem is well-posed, providing a clear mathematical model, complete datasets, explicit constraints, and unambiguous requirements for the output. It is a formalizable and objective task in computational biophysics, free of any scientific or logical flaws.\n\nThe core of this problem is a nonlinear regression analysis to characterize the allelopathic interaction between two plant species. The relationship between the concentration $c$ of an allelochemical and the resulting fractional inhibition $y(c)$ is described by the four-parameter Hill function:\n$$\ny(c) = y_0 + E_{\\max}\\,\\frac{c^{h}}{EC_{50}^{\\,h} + c^{h}}\n$$\nThe four parameters to be estimated from the provided experimental data are:\n- $y_0$: The baseline inhibition at zero concentration, nominally $y(0)$.\n- $E_{\\max}$: The maximal asymptotic inhibition level at saturating concentrations.\n- $EC_{50}$: The half-maximal effective concentration, i.e., the concentration required to achieve $50\\%$ of the maximal effect, $(y_0 + E_{\\max}/2)$.\n- $h$: The Hill coefficient, a measure of the steepness or cooperativity of the response.\n\nThe problem specifies that the experimental data are subject to independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) additive Gaussian errors.

Two standard metrics are required.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of determination, $R^2$, measures the proportion of variance in the observed data that is explained by the model. It is computed as:\n$$\nR^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\text{RSS}}{\\text{TSS}} = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i^{\\text{obs}} - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i^{\\text{obs}} - \\bar{y})^2}\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{y}_i = y(c_i; \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}})$ are the model-predicted values and $\\bar{y}$ is the mean of the observed $y_i^{\\text{obs}}$ values. An $R^2$ value near $1.0$ signifies a high-quality fit.\n\nSecond, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is calculated to assess the relative quality of the model while penalizing for the number of parameters. For a least-squares regression with $k$ parameters and $n$ data points, the AIC is defined as:\n$$\n\\text{AIC} = 2k - 2\\ln(\\hat{L})\n$$\nGiven the assumption of Gaussian errors, the maximized log-likelihood $\\ln(\\hat{L})$ is a function of the minimized RSS:\n$$\n\\ln(\\hat{L}) = -\\frac{n}{2} \\left[ \\ln(2\\pi \\hat{\\sigma}^2) + 1 \\right] \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{\\text{RSS}}{n}\n$$\nThis leads to the computational formula for AIC:\n$$\n\\text{AIC} = 2k + n \\left[ \\ln\\left(2\\pi \\frac{\\text{RSS}}{n}\\right) + 1 \\right]\n$$\nwith the number of parameters being $k=4$.\n\nThe computational solution will proceed by iterating through each of the three provided datasets. For each dataset, it will perform the bounded numerical optimization of the RSS to find the best-fit parameters for the Hill model. Subsequently, it will compute the $R^2$ and AIC values. Finally, the required outputsâ€”$\\widehat{EC}_{50}$, $\\hat{h}$, $R^2$, and AICâ€”will be rounded according to the specified rules ($3$ significant figures for $\\widehat{EC}_{50}$ and $\\hat{h}$, $4$ decimal places for $R^2$, and $2$ decimal places for AIC) and presented in the mandated format.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Fits a four-parameter Hill model to dose-response data, calculates goodness-of-fit statistics,\n    and formats the output as specified.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Helper function to round a number to a specific number of significant figures.\n    def round_sig(x, n):\n        if x == 0:\n            return 0.0\n        # Use format specifier 'g' for significant figures rounding.\n        return float(f\"{x:.{n}g}\")\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            'c': np.array([0., 1., 3., 10., 30., 100., 300.]),\n            'y': np.array([0.00, 0.02, 0.05, 0.22, 0.56, 0.86, 0.97])\n        },\n        {\n            'c': np.array([0., 5., 15., 50., 150., 500.]),\n            'y': np.array([0.00, 0.08, 0.20, 0.38, 0.52, 0.58])\n        },\n        {\n            'c': np.array([0., 0.5, 2., 8., 32., 128.]),\n            'y': np.array([0.00, 0.06, 0.18, 0.35, 0.55, 0.70])\n        }\n    ]\n\n    final_results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        c_data, y_data = case['c'], case['y']\n        n = len(c_data)\n        k = 4  # Number of parameters in the model (y0, Emax, EC50, h)\n\n        # Define the four-parameter Hill model.\n        def hill_model(params, c):\n            y0, Emax, EC50, h = params\n            # Numerically stable calculation to avoid potential overflow with large c or h,\n            # though the original form is also handled correctly by float64 for given ranges.\n            # We handle c=0 case separately to avoid division by zero or log(0) in other forms.\n            # The form c^h / (EC50^h + c^h) is robust for c=0.\n            # To prevent divide-by-zero if EC50 becomes zero during optimization (though bounded)\n            # or if c and EC50 are zero.\n            denom = EC50**h + c**h\n            # Avoid division by zero if all concentrations and EC50 are zero.\n            # Using np.where to handle c=0 correctly, as 0^h can be problematic for h<0.\n            inhibition_term = np.where(c > 0, (c**h) / denom, 0.0)\n            return y0 + Emax * inhibition_term\n\n        # Define the objective function: Residual Sum of Squares (RSS).\n        def rss_objective(params, c, y):\n            model_y = hill_model(params, c)\n            return np.sum((y - model_y)**2)\n\n        # Generate a robust initial guess for the parameters.\n        y0_guess = y_data[0]\n        Emax_guess = np.max(y_data) - y0_guess if np.max(y_data) > y0_guess else 0.1\n        \n        # Robust heuristic for EC50 guess: median of non-zero concentrations.\n        non_zero_c = c_data[c_data > 0]\n        EC50_guess = np.median(non_zero_c) if len(non_zero_c) > 0 else 1.0\n\n        h_guess = 1.0\n        p0 = [y0_guess, Emax_guess, EC50_guess, h_guess]\n\n        # Define bounds for the parameters as per problem requirements.\n        c_max = np.max(c_data) if len(c_data) > 0 else 1.0\n        epsilon = 1e-9\n        bounds = [\n            (-0.1, 0.5),      # y0\n            (0.0, 1.5),       # Emax\n            (epsilon, c_max * 10 if c_max > 0 else 10.0), # EC50\n            (0.2, 5.0)        # h\n        ]\n\n        # Perform the minimization of RSS.\n        res = minimize(\n            rss_objective,\n            p0,\n            args=(c_data, y_data),\n            method='L-BFGS-B',\n            bounds=bounds\n        )\n\n        # Extract optimal parameters.\n        EC50_opt, h_opt = res.x[2], res.x[3]\n        \n        # Calculate goodness-of-fit metrics.\n        rss = res.fun\n        y_mean = np.mean(y_data)\n        tss = np.sum((y_data - y_mean)**2)\n        \n        if tss == 0:\n            r_squared = 1.0 if np.isclose(rss, 0) else 0.0\n        else:\n            r_squared = 1.0 - (rss / tss)\n\n        # Calculate AIC.\n        if rss = 0:\n            # A perfect fit (RSS=0) implies infinite log-likelihood.\n            aic = -np.inf\n        else:\n            aic = 2 * k + n * (np.log(2 * np.pi * rss / n) + 1)\n        \n        # Apply rounding rules.\n        ec50_rounded = round_sig(EC50_opt, 3)\n        h_rounded = round_sig(h_opt, 3)\n        r2_rounded = round(r_squared, 4)\n        aic_rounded = round(aic, 2)\n\n        final_results.append([ec50_rounded, h_rounded, r2_rounded, aic_rounded])\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(str(final_results).replace(\" \", \"\"))\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2547619"}]}
