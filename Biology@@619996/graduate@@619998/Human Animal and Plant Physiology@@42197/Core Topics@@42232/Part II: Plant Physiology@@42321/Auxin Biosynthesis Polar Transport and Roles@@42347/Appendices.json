Consider indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a monoprotic weak acid with acid dissociation constant defined by $pK_{a} = 4.75$. Assume the following:\n- The apoplast pH is $pH_{\\mathrm{apo}} = 5.5$, while the cytosolic pH is higher by $\\Delta pH = 1.5$, so $pH_{\\mathrm{cyt}} = pH_{\\mathrm{apo}} + \\Delta pH$.\n- The membrane potential is $\\Delta \\psi = \\psi_{\\mathrm{cyt}} - \\psi_{\\mathrm{apo}} = -120\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ (inside negative).\n- The neutral protonated form $\\mathrm{IAAH}$ diffuses rapidly across the membrane and thus equilibrates its chemical potential between compartments.\n- The anionic form $\\mathrm{IAA}^{-}$ is transported into the cytosol by a one-proton:one-anion symporter operating near equilibrium of the coupled electrochemical potentials.\n- Solutions are ideal and well-mixed; temperature is $T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$; acid-base equilibria are established in each compartment.\n\nStarting from definitions of electrochemical potential and the weak acid dissociation relation in each compartment, derive an expression for the steady-state cytosol-to-apoplast ratio of total IAA concentration, $\\frac{[\\mathrm{IAA}]_{\\mathrm{tot,cyt}}}{[\\mathrm{IAA}]_{\\mathrm{tot,apo}}}$, and then compute its numerical value using the parameters above.

Do not include any units in your final reported value.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the steady-state ratio of total indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) concentration between the cytosol and the apoplast of a plant cell.\n\nFirst, we must define the total concentration of IAA, $[\\mathrm{IAA}]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, in any given compartment. As IAA is a monoprotic weak acid, it exists in two forms: the neutral, protonated form ($\\mathrm{IAAH}$) and the anionic, deprotonated form ($\\mathrm{IAA}^{-}$). The total concentration is the sum of the concentrations of these two species:\n$$[\\mathrm{IAA}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [\\mathrm{IAAH}] + [\\mathrm{IAA}^{-}]$$\nThis relation holds for both the apoplast (subscript 'apo') and the cytosol (subscript 'cyt').\n\nThe equilibrium between the two forms is governed by the acid dissociation reaction $\\mathrm{IAAH} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{IAA}^{-} + \\mathrm{H}^{+}$ with the acid dissociation constant $K_a$. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation describes this equilibrium:\n$$pH = pK_a + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{IAA}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{IAAH}]}\\right)$$\nwhere $pK_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)$. Rearranging this equation allows us to express the concentration of the anionic form in terms of the neutral form:\n$$[\\mathrm{IAA}^{-}] = [\\mathrm{IAAH}] \\cdot 10^{(pH - pK_a)}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for total concentration for a given compartment $i \\in \\{\\mathrm{cyt}, \\mathrm{apo}\\}$, we obtain:\n$$[\\mathrm{IAA}]_{\\mathrm{tot},i} = [\\mathrm{IAAH}]_i + [\\mathrm{IAAH}]_i \\cdot 10^{(pH_i - pK_a)} = [\\mathrm{IAAH}]_i \\left(1 + 10^{(pH_i - pK_a)}\\right)$$\n\nNext, we apply the conditions for transport across the plasma membrane to relate the concentrations in the two compartments.\nThe problem states that the neutral form, $\\mathrm{IAAH}$, diffuses rapidly across the membrane and equilibrates its chemical potential. The chemical potential of an uncharged species $j$ is $\\mu_j = \\mu_j^0 + RT \\ln[j]$. At equilibrium, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{IAAH,cyt}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{IAAH,apo}}$.\n$$\\mu_{\\mathrm{IAAH}}^0 + RT \\ln[\\mathrm{IAAH}]_{\\mathrm{cyt}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{IAAH}}^0 + RT \\ln[\\mathrm{IAAH}]_{\\mathrm{apo}}$$\nThis simplifies directly to:\n$$[\\mathrm{IAAH}]_{\\mathrm{cyt}} = [\\mathrm{IAAH}]_{\\mathrm{apo}}$$\nThis phenomenon is central to the \"acid trap\" mechanism for weak acid accumulation.\n\nThe problem also specifies that the anionic form, $\\mathrm{IAA}^{-}$, is transported by a one-proton:one-anion symporter operating near equilibrium. The net process is $\\mathrm{H}^{+}_{\\mathrm{apo}} + \\mathrm{IAA}^{-}_{\\mathrm{apo}} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{H}^{+}_{\\mathrm{cyt}} + \\mathrm{IAA}^{-}_{\\mathrm{cyt}}$. The change in electrochemical potential, $\\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}$, for this coupled transport must be zero at equilibrium.\nThe electrochemical potential for an ion $j$ with charge $z_j$ is $\\tilde{\\mu}_j = \\mu_j^0 + RT \\ln[j] + z_j F \\psi$.\nThe equilibrium condition is $\\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} + \\Delta\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{IAA}^{-}} = 0$.\n$$ \\left(RT \\ln\\frac{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{cyt}}}{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{apo}}} + z_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}F\\Delta\\psi\\right) + \\left(RT \\ln\\frac{[\\mathrm{IAA}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{cyt}}}{[\\mathrm{IAA}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{apo}}} + z_{\\mathrm{IAA}^{-}}F\\Delta\\psi\\right) = 0 $$\nWith $z_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = +1$ and $z_{\\mathrm{IAA}^{-}} = -1$, the terms involving the membrane potential $\\Delta\\psi = \\psi_{\\mathrm{cyt}} - \\psi_{\\mathrm{apo}}$ cancel out: $(+1-1)F\\Delta\\psi = 0$. The equilibrium for this symporter is thus independent of the membrane potential. The equation becomes:\n$$ RT \\ln\\frac{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{cyt}}}{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{apo}}} + RT \\ln\\frac{[\\mathrm{IAA}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{cyt}}}{[\\mathrm{IAA}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{apo}}} = 0 \\implies \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{cyt}}[\\mathrm{IAA}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{cyt}}}{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{apo}}[\\mathrm{IAA}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{apo}}}\\right) = 0 $$\nThis yields $\\frac{[\\mathrm{IAA}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{cyt}}}{[\\mathrm{IAA}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{apo}}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{apo}}}{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{cyt}}} = \\frac{10^{-pH_{\\mathrm{apo}}}}{10^{-pH_{\\mathrm{cyt}}}} = 10^{(pH_{\\mathrm{cyt}} - pH_{\\mathrm{apo}})}$. This result is identical to what one obtains by combining $[\\mathrm{IAAH}]_{\\mathrm{cyt}} = [\\mathrm{IAAH}]_{\\mathrm{apo}}$ with the Henderson-Hasselbalch relations for both compartments, confirming the self-consistency of the problem's premises.\n\nWe can now derive the expression for the ratio of total IAA concentrations.\n$$ \\frac{[\\mathrm{IAA}]_{\\mathrm{tot,cyt}}}{[\\mathrm{IAA}]_{\\mathrm{tot,apo}}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{IAAH}]_{\\mathrm{cyt}}\\left(1 + 10^{(pH_{\\mathrm{cyt}} - pK_a)}\\right)}{[\\mathrm{IAAH}]_{\\mathrm{apo}}\\left(1 + 10^{(pH_{\\mathrm{apo}} - pK_a)}\\right)} $$\nUsing the fact that $[\\mathrm{IAAH}]_{\\mathrm{cyt}} = [\\mathrm{IAAH}]_{\\mathrm{apo}}$, we arrive at the desired general expression:\n$$ \\frac{[\\mathrm{IAA}]_{\\mathrm{tot,cyt}}}{[\\mathrm{IAA}]_{\\mathrm{tot,apo}}} = \\frac{1 + 10^{(pH_{\\mathrm{cyt}} - pK_a)}}{1 + 10^{(pH_{\\mathrm{apo}} - pK_a)}} $$\nIt is notable that the final ratio does not depend on the membrane potential $\\Delta\\psi$, which is provided as extraneous information in this specific context.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided parameters:\n$pK_a = 4.75$\n$pH_{\\mathrm{apo}} = 5.5$\n$\\Delta pH = 1.5$, so $pH_{\\mathrm{cyt}} = pH_{\\mathrm{apo}} + \\Delta pH = 5.5 + 1.5 = 7.0$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$ \\frac{[\\mathrm{IAA}]_{\\mathrm{tot,cyt}}}{[\\mathrm{IAA}]_{\\mathrm{tot,apo}}} = \\frac{1 + 10^{(7.0 - 4.75)}}{1 + 10^{(5.5 - 4.75)}} = \\frac{1 + 10^{2.25}}{1 + 10^{0.75}} $$\nThe exponents are related by a factor of $3$, as $2.25 = 3 \\times 0.75$. Let $A = 10^{0.75}$. The expression becomes $\\frac{1+A^3}{1+A}$. Using the sum of cubes factorization, $A^3+1 = (A+1)(A^2-A+1)$, this simplifies to:\n$$ A^2 - A + 1 = (10^{0.75})^2 - 10^{0.75} + 1 = 10^{1.5} - 10^{0.75} + 1 $$\nWe calculate the values of the terms:\n$10^{1.5} = 10\\sqrt{10} \\approx 31.6227766$\n$10^{0.75} = 10^{3/4} \\approx 5.62341325$\nThe ratio is therefore:\n$31.6227766 - 5.62341325 + 1 = 25.99936335 + 1 = 26.99936335$\n\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives $27.00$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{27.00}$$", "id": "2550305"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the principles of cellular transport, we can explore how coordinated cell-to-cell movement gives rise to tissue-scale auxin gradients, which are fundamental to morphogenesis.

Auxin is produced in a localized source region at $x=0$ that injects a constant net influx $J_s$ into the tissue, and is removed by a perfect sink at $x=L$ that clamps the intercellular auxin concentration to zero. The membrane efflux carriers PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins are uniformly basally polarized such that, in the coarse-grained continuum limit, their vectorial transport can be modeled as a uniform advective drift of auxin with velocity $v>0$ along the $+x$ direction. Assume that:\n- Auxin concentration is $c(x,t)$.\n- Bulk production and degradation within $0<x<L$ are negligible; production and removal occur only at the boundaries.\n- The total flux is given by the sum of Fickian diffusion and drift due to polar transport: $J(x,t) = - D \\,\\partial c/\\partial x + v\\,c$, where $D>0$ is the diffusion coefficient.\n- Conservation of mass applies: $\\partial c/\\partial t = - \\partial J/\\partial x$ in the interior.\n- Boundary conditions: At $x=0$, the boundary injects a fixed influx $J_s$ into the tissue, i.e., $J(0,t)=J_s$.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains no ambiguities or contradictions. I shall therefore proceed with its solution.\n\nThe system is governed by the conservation of mass, which states that the rate of change of concentration $c(x,t)$ is equal to the negative divergence of the flux $J(x,t)$. In one dimension, this is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x}\n$$\nThe flux $J$ is given as the sum of a Fickian diffusive component and an advective component due to polar transport:\n$$\nJ(x,t) = - D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} + v c\n$$\nwhere $D > 0$ is the diffusion coefficient and $v > 0$ is the drift velocity.\n\nSubstituting the expression for the flux into the continuity equation, we obtain the governing partial differential equation (PDE), commonly known as the advection-diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( - D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} + v c \\right) = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} - v \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the steady-state profile, $c(x)$. In steady state, all time derivatives vanish, so $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = 0$. The PDE thus reduces to a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\nD \\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} - v \\frac{dc}{dx} = 0\n$$\nGiven that $D > 0$, we can divide by it to obtain the standard form:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} - \\frac{v}{D} \\frac{dc}{dx} = 0\n$$\nThis is a linear, homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients. We solve it by finding the roots of its characteristic polynomial, $m^2 - \\frac{v}{D} m = 0$.\n$$\nm \\left( m - \\frac{v}{D} \\right) = 0\n$$\nThe roots are $m_1 = 0$ and $m_2 = \\frac{v}{D}$. The general solution for $c(x)$ is a linear combination of the exponential functions corresponding to these roots:\n$$\nc(x) = C_1 e^{m_1 x} + C_2 e^{m_2 x} = C_1 e^{0 \\cdot x} + C_2 e^{\\frac{v}{D} x} = C_1 + C_2 e^{\\frac{v}{D} x}\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are integration constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1.  At the sink $x=L$, the concentration is clamped to zero: $c(L) = 0$.\n2.  At the source $x=0$, there is a constant influx $J_s$: $J(0) = J_s$.\n\nFirst, we apply the condition at $x=L$:\n$$\nc(L) = C_1 + C_2 e^{\\frac{vL}{D}} = 0 \\implies C_1 = -C_2 e^{\\frac{vL}{D}}\n$$\nNext, we apply the condition at $x=0$. The steady-state flux is $J(x) = -D \\frac{dc}{dx} + v c(x)$. Let us evaluate this expression using our general solution. The derivative of $c(x)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dx} = C_2 \\frac{v}{D} e^{\\frac{v}{D} x}\n$$\nSubstituting this and $c(x)$ into the flux equation:\n$$\nJ(x) = -D \\left( C_2 \\frac{v}{D} e^{\\frac{v}{D} x} \\right) + v \\left( C_1 + C_2 e^{\\frac{v}{D} x} \\right) = -C_2 v e^{\\frac{v}{D} x} + v C_1 + v C_2 e^{\\frac{v}{D} x} = v C_1\n$$\nThis result, $J(x) = v C_1$, shows that the flux is constant throughout the tissue, which is a required consequence of the steady-state assumption with no internal sources or sinks ($\\frac{dJ}{dx} = 0$).\nApplying the boundary condition $J(0) = J_s$:\n$$\nv C_1 = J_s \\implies C_1 = \\frac{J_s}{v}\n$$\nNow we have determined $C_1$. Using the relation from the first boundary condition, we find $C_2$:\n$$\n\\frac{J_s}{v} = -C_2 e^{\\frac{vL}{D}} \\implies C_2 = - \\frac{J_s}{v} e^{-\\frac{vL}{D}}\n$$\nSubstituting the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the general solution for $c(x)$:\n$$\nc(x) = \\frac{J_s}{v} - \\left( \\frac{J_s}{v} e^{-\\frac{vL}{D}} \\right) e^{\\frac{v}{D} x} = \\frac{J_s}{v} \\left( 1 - e^{\\frac{v}{D}(x-L)} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the complete steady-state auxin profile. To identify the gradient length scale, we must examine the exponential term. The expression can be rewritten in terms of the distance from the sink, $z = L-x$:\n$$\nc(x) = \\frac{J_s}{v} \\left( 1 - e^{-\\frac{v}{D}(L-x)} \\right) = \\frac{J_s}{v} \\left( 1 - e^{-\\frac{L-x}{D/v}} \\right)\n$$\nThis form clearly shows that the concentration profile is described by an exponential function whose argument is the ratio of a distance ($L-x$) to a characteristic length. This characteristic length, denoted by $\\lambda$, is the gradient length scale. From the form of the exponent, we identify:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{D}{v}\n$$\nThis length scale represents the distance over which diffusion effectively counteracts advection. An increase in the diffusion coefficient $D$ signifies a greater tendency for auxin to undergo random motion, opposing the directed transport quantified by $v$. As $\\lambda$ is directly proportional to $D$, an increase in $D$ will necessarily lengthen the scale over which the gradient is established. This means the concentration profile becomes shallower and extends further from the sink; diffusion becomes more effective at smearing the gradient against the sharpening effect of advection. Conversely, a decrease in $D$ reduces $\\lambda$, leading to a steeper gradient confined more closely to the sink boundary, as advective transport becomes dominant.\n\nThe problem requires the analytic expression for this gradient length scale.

DR5 primarily reports the transcriptional output of auxin signaling rather than absolute IAA concentration; its signal depends on the local complement of Auxin Response Factors (ARFs) and Aux/IAA dynamics and is limited in temporal resolution by promoter activity, transcription,translation, and fluorescent protein maturation.\n\nThis statement is analyzed using the provided principles. DR5 is a \"synthetic transcriptional reporter\". The \"Central dogma\" principle states that \"transcriptional reporters integrate upstream signals over time\" and their production involves \"promoter-driven transcription and subsequent translation, and... chromophore maturation\". This directly supports the claim that its temporal resolution is limited by these multi-step biological processes, and that it integrates signals over time rather than reporting an instantaneous concentration. The \"Auxin signaling mechanism\" principle describes how IAA triggers the degradation of Aux/IAA repressors. These repressors control the activity of Auxin Response Factors (ARFs), which are the transcription factors that bind to promoters like DR5. Therefore, the output of DR5 is not a direct readout of IAA but the result of the entire signaling cascade, which depends on the specific types and amounts of ARFs and Aux/IAAs present in a given cell. The statement is a correct application of the given principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. DII–Venus directly binds IAA and increases fluorescence upon auxin binding, yielding an instantaneous, direct measure of IAA concentration that is independent of proteasome activity.\n\nThis statement is factually incorrect based on the provided \"Auxin signaling mechanism\". First, IAA does not bind directly to the DII domain (part of an Aux/IAA protein). Instead, IAA acts as \"molecular glue\" promoting the interaction between the Aux/IAA repressor and the TIR$1$/AFB co-receptor. Second, the reporter's response is a *decrease* in fluorescence due to \"proteasome-mediated degradation\", not an increase. Third, the process is not instantaneous as it involves multiple steps: ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Fourth, the entire mechanism is explicitly dependent on \"proteasome-mediated degradation\". Every clause in this statement is a direct contradiction of the provided principles.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. R2D2 co-expresses a degradable DII–fluorophore and a non-degradable mDII reference under the same promoter; the resulting ratiometric signal improves comparability across cells and tissues but still reports auxin input into the TIR$1$/AFB pathway and can be biased by differences in fluorophore maturation and proteasome capacity.\n\nThe description of R2D2 as a co-expression system of a responsive (DII) and non-responsive (mDII) element fits the \"Ratiometric imaging principle,\" which states this approach \"allow[s] pixelwise ratioing to normalize for expression level, imaging conditions, and tissue optical properties,\" thus improving comparability. The responsive element is based on the DII degron, so according to the \"Auxin signaling mechanism\" principle, it reports the \"input into the TIR$1$/AFB pathway.\" The \"Ratiometric imaging principle\" itself cautions that the method is \"subject to any non-shared kinetics (for example, differential maturation or stability)\". This supports the claim that differences in fluorophore maturation can introduce bias. Finally, since the signal relies on degradation, its fidelity is dependent on the capacity of the cellular machinery responsible for that degradation, namely the ubiquitin-proteasome system. A saturated proteasome would fail to report further increases in auxin input, representing a valid limitation. The statement is logically sound and consistent with all relevant principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nD. LC–MS with stable isotope dilution, when $^{13}\\mathrm{C}_6$-IAA is spiked before extraction, supports absolute quantification of endogenous IAA by comparing analyte-to-internal-standard ion ratios; it cannot provide subcellular localization in vivo and requires chromatographic resolution to avoid isobaric interferences.\n\nThis statement is a direct and accurate summary of the \"Mass spectrometry principle for isotope dilution.\" The principle states that spiking with a \"stable isotope-labeled internal standard\" (such as $^{13}\\mathrm{C}_6$-IAA) \"allows calculation of the analyte amount from the analyte-to-standard ion ratio, correcting for extraction losses\". This is the definition of absolute quantification. The sample processing, which involves tissue extraction, inherently destroys spatial information, meaning it \"cannot provide subcellular localization\". The principle explicitly includes the condition \"provided chromatographic separation prevents isobaric interferences,\" which supports the final part of the statement. The statement is entirely justified.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nE. Because DR5 and DII–Venus respond to intracellular auxin, they directly measure rates of polar auxin transport and are essentially independent of TIR$1$/AFB co-receptor abundance or activity.\n\nThis statement contains two fundamental errors. First, these reporters respond to the local concentration or, more accurately, the local signaling activity of auxin. They do not measure a *rate* of transport, which is a flux (quantity per area per time). Second, the \"Auxin signaling mechanism\" principle explicitly states that the entire signal transduction pathway for both reporters culminates from, or is directly mediated by, the TIR$1$/AFB co-receptors. Both degradation of DII-Venus and de-repression of DR5 are downstream of and dependent on TIR$1$/AFB activity. To claim they are \"essentially independent\" of this step is a direct contradiction.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nF. Stable isotope dilution LC–MS cannot distinguish IAA from indole-$3$-butyric acid (IBA) because they produce identical mass-to-charge values, even with chromatographic separation.\n\nThis statement is chemically and methodologically flawed. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) has the chemical formula $\\mathrm{C}_{10}\\mathrm{H}_{9}\\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ (molar mass $\\approx 175.19~\\mathrm{g/mol}$). Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) has the chemical formula $\\mathrm{C}_{12}\\mathrm{H}_{13}\\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ (molar mass $\\approx 203.24~\\mathrm{g/mol}$). They are not isobars; they do not have the same nominal or exact mass and thus do not produce identical mass-to-charge values. Furthermore, even if two compounds *were* isobaric, the \"LC-MS\" method uses Liquid Chromatography (LC) precisely for the purpose of temporally separating different molecules before they enter the mass spectrometer. The \"Mass spectrometry principle\" itself notes the importance of \"chromatographic separation\" to prevent \"isobaric interferences\". The claim that separation is impossible even with chromatography is a contradiction of the method's purpose, and the premise of the compounds being isobaric is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2550278"}]}
