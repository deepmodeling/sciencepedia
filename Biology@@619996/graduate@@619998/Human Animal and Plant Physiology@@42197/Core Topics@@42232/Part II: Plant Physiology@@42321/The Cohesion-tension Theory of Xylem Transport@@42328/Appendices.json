It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid dynamics and plant biophysics, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is formulated objectively. The problem requires a standard derivation and calculation pertinent to the cohesion-tension theory of xylem transport. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe total water potential, $\\Psi$, is the chemical potential of water per unit volume. It is the sum of several components, primarily the pressure potential ($\\Psi_p$), the solute or osmotic potential ($\\Psi_s$), and the gravitational potential ($\\Psi_g$).\n$$ \\Psi = \\Psi_p + \\Psi_s + \\Psi_g $$\nThe problem states to neglect osmotic contributions within the xylem conduit, so we consider only $\\Psi_p$ and $\\Psi_g$. The gravitational component of water potential at a height $z$ relative to a reference plane is given by:\n$$ \\Psi_g = \\rho g z $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density of the fluid (xylem sap, treated as pure water) and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nWe are asked to start from the principle of hydrostatic balance. In a state of hydrostatic equilibrium (i.e., no net flow of water), the total water potential $\\Psi$ must be constant at all points within the continuous fluid column. Let us set the reference plane at the base of the tree, so $z_{\\text{base}} = 0$. The height of the canopy is $z_{\\text{canopy}} = h$. For hydrostatic equilibrium between the base and the canopy, we must have:\n$$ \\Psi_{\\text{base}} = \\Psi_{\\text{canopy}} $$\nExpanding this using the relevant components gives:\n$$ \\Psi_{p, \\text{base}} + \\Psi_{g, \\text{base}} = \\Psi_{p, \\text{canopy}} + \\Psi_{g, \\text{canopy}} $$\nRearranging this equation to find the difference in the gravitational component yields:\n$$ \\Psi_{g, \\text{canopy}} - \\Psi_{g, \\text{base}} = \\Psi_{p, \\text{base}} - \\Psi_{p, \\text{canopy}} $$\nThe term on the right is the negative of the pressure potential difference, $-(\\Psi_{p, \\text{canopy}} - \\Psi_{p, \\text{base}})$. The pressure potential $\\Psi_p$ is equivalent to the gauge pressure $P$. The difference in hydrostatic pressure between two points separated by a vertical distance $h$ in a fluid of density $\\rho$ is given by $\\Delta P = - \\rho g h$. Therefore:\n$$ \\Psi_{p, \\text{canopy}} - \\Psi_{p, \\text{base}} = -\\rho g h $$\nSubstituting this back into the rearranged equilibrium equation:\n$$ \\Psi_{g, \\text{canopy}} - \\Psi_{g, \\text{base}} = -(-\\rho g h) = \\rho g h $$\nThis is the gravitational component of the water potential difference between the base and the canopy, which we denote as $\\Delta \\Psi_g$.\n$$ \\Delta \\Psi_g = \\rho g h $$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNext, we compute the magnitude of this potential difference using the provided values:\n$\\rho = 1.00 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ kg m}^{-3}$\n$g = 9.81 \\text{ m s}^{-2}$\n$h = 120 \\text{ m}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$ \\Delta \\Psi_g = (1.00 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ kg m}^{-3}) \\times (9.81 \\text{ m s}^{-2}) \\times (120 \\text{ m}) $$\n$$ \\Delta \\Psi_g = 1177200 \\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{m} \\cdot \\text{s}^2} $$\nThe resulting unit is Pascal (Pa), since $1 \\text{ Pa} = 1 \\text{ N m}^{-2} = 1 (\\text{kg m s}^{-2}) \\text{m}^{-2} = 1 \\text{ kg m}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-2}$.\n$$ \\Delta \\Psi_g = 1.1772 \\times 10^6 \\text{ Pa} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in megapascal (MPa), where $1 \\text{ MPa} = 10^6 \\text{ Pa}$.\n$$ \\Delta \\Psi_g = 1.1772 \\text{ MPa} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as instructed, we get $1.177 \\text{ MPa}$.\n\nFinally, we discuss the implication of this gravitational component. The cohesion-tension theory posits that water is pulled up the xylem by a very negative water potential in the leaves, which is generated by transpiration. Water moves passively down a water potential gradient. For water to move from the soil (at the base) to the leaves (at the canopy), the total water potential in the leaves, $\\Psi_{\\text{leaf}}$, must be lower than that in the soil, $\\Psi_{\\text{soil}}$. The total potential difference, $\\Delta\\Psi = \\Psi_{\\text{leaf}} - \\Psi_{\\text{soil}}$, must be sufficiently negative to overcome both the gravitational potential increase ($\\Delta\\Psi_g = \\rho g h$) and the frictional resistance to flow through the xylem conduits.\n\nThe gravitational potential, $\\Delta\\Psi_g = \\rho g h \\approx +1.18$ MPa, represents an energetic \"cost\" or barrier to lifting the water column. This means that, even before considering flow, the water potential in the leaves must be at least $1.18$ MPa lower than the soil water potential simply to support the weight of the water column. For instance, if $\\Psi_{\\text{soil}} \\approx 0$ MPa, then the leaf water potential $\\Psi_{\\text{leaf}}$ must be at a minimum $-1.18$ MPa to achieve hydrostatic balance. To actually drive upward flow (transpiration), a further potential drop is required to overcome viscous dissipation (friction). Therefore, the leaf water potential during midday transpiration must be significantly more negative than $-\\rho g h$. This gravitational component thereby sets a strict physical constraint on the minimum (least negative) water potential that plant leaves must be able to generate and withstand to transport water to a given height.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.177}$$", "id": "2614968"}, {"introduction": "The water column in the xylem can sustain extreme tension without breaking due to cohesion between water molecules and a crucial defense against cavitation known as air-seeding.

We will proceed to derive the expression for the pressure difference across the interface and then evaluate its magnitude.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation from the principle of virtual work, relating the pressure-volume work to the change in interfacial free energy. We consider a system composed of a gas phase and a liquid (water) phase, separated by an interface forming a meniscus within a cylindrical pore of radius $r$. The meniscus is a spherical cap. The contact line of the three phases (gas, liquid, solid) is pinned at the pore rim, a circle of radius $r$. The contact angle, $\\theta$, is defined at this contact line. $\\Delta P$ is the pressure difference $P_{\\text{gas}} - P_{\\text{liquid}}$.\n\nLet us consider a virtual displacement of the liquid-gas interface. The most convenient virtual displacement for this problem is an infinitesimal translation $dz$ of the fluid along the axis of the cylindrical pore. This displacement causes the three-phase contact line to move along the solid wall of the pore.\n\nThe first law of thermodynamics for a system at constant temperature, undergoing a reversible process, can be expressed in terms of the Helmholtz free energy, $F = U - TS$. The differential change is $dF = -P dV + \\sum_i \\gamma_i dA_i$, where the second term represents the change in surface free energy. For a multi-phase system in mechanical equilibrium, the total change in Helmholtz free energy for a virtual displacement must be zero, $dF_{\\text{total}} = 0$.\n\nThe total free energy of our system is the sum of the bulk and interfacial energies:\n$F_{\\text{total}} = F_{\\text{liquid}} + F_{\\text{gas}} + F_{\\text{interface}}$\nFor a virtual displacement, the change is:\n$dF_{\\text{total}} = dF_{\\text{liquid}} + dF_{\\text{gas}} + dF_{\\text{interface}} = 0$\n\nThe work terms for the bulk phases are $dF_{\\text{liquid}} = -P_{\\text{liquid}} dV_{\\text{liquid}}$ and $dF_{\\text{gas}} = -P_{\\text{gas}} dV_{\\text{gas}}$. In our virtual displacement $dz$, the volume of the liquid increases by $dV_{\\text{liquid}} = \\pi r^2 dz$, and the volume of the gas decreases by the same amount, so $dV_{\\text{gas}} = -\\pi r^2 dz$.\nThe total change in the bulk free energy is:\n$dF_{\\text{bulk}} = -P_{\\text{liquid}}(\\pi r^2 dz) - P_{\\text{gas}}(-\\pi r^2 dz) = (P_{\\text{gas}} - P_{\\text{liquid}})\\pi r^2 dz = \\Delta P \\pi r^2 dz$.\n\nThe interfacial free energy has three components, corresponding to the solid-gas, solid-liquid, and liquid-gas interfaces. Let their respective surface tensions be $\\gamma_{sg}$, $\\gamma_{sl}$, and $\\gamma_{lg}$ (denoted as $\\gamma$ in the problem).\n$F_{\\text{interface}} = \\gamma_{sg} A_{sg} + \\gamma_{sl} A_{sl} + \\gamma A_{lg}$.\nDuring the displacement $dz$, the liquid-gas interface of area $A_{lg}$ is translated, so its area does not change to first order, $dA_{lg}=0$. However, the area of the solid-liquid interface increases as it advances along the pore wall: $dA_{sl} = 2\\pi r dz$. Correspondingly, the area of the solid-gas interface decreases: $dA_{sg} = -2\\pi r dz$.\nThe change in interfacial free energy is:\n$dF_{\\text{interface}} = \\gamma_{sg} (-2\\pi r dz) + \\gamma_{sl} (2\\pi r dz) = (\\gamma_{sl} - \\gamma_{sg}) 2\\pi r dz$.\n\nAt equilibrium, the total free energy change is zero:\n$dF_{\\text{total}} = \\Delta P \\pi r^2 dz + (\\gamma_{sl} - \\gamma_{sg}) 2\\pi r dz = 0$.\n$\\Delta P \\pi r^2 = -(\\gamma_{sl} - \\gamma_{sg}) 2\\pi r = (\\gamma_{sg} - \\gamma_{sl}) 2\\pi r$.\n\nThe term $(\\gamma_{sg} - \\gamma_{sl})$ is related to the liquid-gas surface tension $\\gamma$ and the contact angle $\\theta$ by the Young-Dupré equation for the equilibrium contact line:\n$\\gamma_{sg} = \\gamma_{sl} + \\gamma \\cos\\theta$.\nTherefore, $\\gamma_{sg} - \\gamma_{sl} = \\gamma \\cos\\theta$.\n\nSubstituting this into our equilibrium condition gives:\n$\\Delta P \\pi r^2 = (\\gamma \\cos\\theta) 2\\pi r$.\n\nSolving for $\\Delta P = P_{\\text{gas}} - P_{\\text{liquid}}$, we obtain the desired expression:\n$$\n\\Delta P = \\frac{2\\gamma \\cos\\theta}{r}\n$$\nThis is the required expression, which is a specific form of the Young-Laplace equation for a spherical meniscus in a cylindrical capillary.\n\nNow, we evaluate the magnitude of $\\Delta P$ using the given values:\nPore radius, $r = 50 \\ \\text{nm} = 50 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\text{m}$.\nAir-water surface tension, $\\gamma = 0.072 \\ \\text{N m}^{-1}$.\nContact angle, $\\theta = 0^\\circ$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$\\Delta P = \\frac{2 \\times (0.072 \\ \\text{N m}^{-1}) \\times \\cos(0^\\circ)}{50 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\text{m}}$.\nSince $\\cos(0^\\circ) = 1$:\n$\\Delta P = \\frac{2 \\times 0.072}{50 \\times 10^{-9}} \\ \\frac{\\text{N}}{\\text{m}^2}$.\nThe unit $\\text{N m}^{-2}$ is equivalent to the Pascal ($\\text{Pa}$).\n$\\Delta P = \\frac{0.144}{50 \\times 10^{-9}} \\ \\text{Pa} = \\frac{0.144}{5 \\times 10^{-8}} \\ \\text{Pa} = 0.0288 \\times 10^8 \\ \\text{Pa} = 2.88 \\times 10^6 \\ \\text{Pa}$.\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in megapascals ($\\text{MPa}$), where $1 \\ \\text{MPa} = 10^6 \\ \\text{Pa}$.\n$\\Delta P = 2.88 \\ \\text{MPa}$.\n\nFinally, we must round the result to two significant figures.\n$\\Delta P \\approx 2.9 \\ \\text{MPa}$.\n\nThis positive pressure difference represents the pressure that must be applied to the gas phase relative to the liquid phase to force air through the pore, a phenomenon known as air seeding.
