The concentration of the complex $[C]$ cannot be greater than the total concentration of either reactant. The positive root would yield a value for $[C]$ that is unphysically large (greater than $[B]_{\\text{total}} + [P]_{\\text{total}}$). Therefore, we must select the negative root.\n$$[C] = \\frac{([B]_{\\text{total}} + [P]_{\\text{total}} + K_{d}) - \\sqrt{([B]_{\\text{total}} + [P]_{\\text{total}} + K_{d})^{2} - 4[B]_{\\text{total}}[P]_{\\text{total}}}}{2}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$$[B]_{\\text{total}} = 830.28 \\text{ nM}$$\n$$[P]_{\\text{total}} = 622.71 \\text{ nM}$$\n$$K_{d} = 100 \\text{ nM}$$\n\nSum term: $[B]_{\\text{total}} + [P]_{\\text{total}} + K_{d} = 830.28 + 622.71 + 100 = 1552.99 \\text{ nM}$.\nProduct term: $[B]_{\\text{total}}[P]_{\\text{total}} = (830.28)(622.71) = 517111.4 \\text{ nM}^{2}$.\n\nSubstitute into the solution for $[C]$:\n$$[C] = \\frac{1552.99 - \\sqrt{(1552.99)^{2} - 4(517111.4)}}{2}$$\n$$[C] = \\frac{1552.99 - \\sqrt{2411778 - 2068445.6}}{2}$$\n$$[C] = \\frac{1552.99 - \\sqrt{343332.4}}{2}$$\n$$[C] = \\frac{1552.99 - 585.9457}{2} = \\frac{967.0443}{2} = 483.522 \\text{ nM}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the Manders coefficient $M_{2}$:\n$$M_{2} = \\frac{[C]}{[P]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{483.522 \\text{ nM}}{622.71 \\text{ nM}} \\approx 0.7765$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$M_{2} \\approx 0.777$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.777}\n$$", "id": "2596693"}]}
