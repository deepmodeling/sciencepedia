The product $F \\Delta \\psi$ has units of $(\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{V})$. Since one volt is one joule per coulomb ($1\\ \\mathrm{V} = 1\\ \\mathrm{J\\,C^{-1}}$), the unit is $\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$, which is consistent with $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the terms inside the parentheses:\nThe energy from ATP per proton:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ATP}}}{s} = \\frac{52\\,000\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}}{3} \\approx 17333.33\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\nThe work against the electrical field per proton:\n$$ F \\Delta \\psi = (96\\,485\\ \\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}) \\cdot (0.03\\ \\mathrm{V}) = 2894.55\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\nThe net energy available to build the chemical gradient:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ATP}}}{s} - F \\Delta \\psi = 17333.33\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} - 2894.55\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} = 14438.78\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\nNext, calculate the denominator term:\n$$ RT \\ln(10) = (8.314\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\cdot (298\\ \\mathrm{K}) \\cdot \\ln(10) \\approx 5705.85\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\nFinally, compute the ratio:\n$$ \\Delta \\mathrm{pH}_{\\max} = \\frac{14438.78\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}}{5705.85\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}} \\approx 2.53051 $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, the result is $2.531$. This positive value correctly indicates that the vacuole is more acidic (has a lower pH) than the cytosol at the limit of the pump's capacity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.531}$$", "id": "2597063"}]}
