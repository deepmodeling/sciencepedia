The following well-established facts may be taken as the fundamental base for reasoning:\n\n- In LD plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana, the transcription of CONSTANS (CO) is under circadian control, producing a daily waveform in which CO messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) accumulates predominantly in the late subjective day under long photoperiods.\n- CO protein is unstable in darkness due to ubiquitination by the Constitutively Photomorphogenic 1 (COP1) E3 ligase complex and is stabilized in light via photoreceptors (notably Cryptochrome 2 and Phytochrome A), whereas early-day red light perceived by Phytochrome B can promote CO protein turnover.\n- When CO protein accumulates in light at the time of high CO mRNA, it activates FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) transcription in leaves, FT protein moves to the shoot apical meristem, and flowering is induced.\n- A skeleton photoperiod comprises brief light pulses that can both set circadian phase and provide temporally localized light input without continuous illumination.\n- The circadian period is close to $24$ h, and we define $t$ (in h) as time elapsed from a brief “dawn-setting” white-light pulse delivered at $t=0$.\n\nIn a controlled experiment, a plant is maintained otherwise in darkness but receives two identical white-light pulses per $24$ h cycle: a $0.5$ h pulse at $t=0$ to define circadian dawn and a second $0.5$ h pulse at a chosen time $t=t_{2}$.

Deliver the second pulse at $t=20$ h", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically sound and well-posed. It accurately describes the external coincidence model for photoperiodic flowering induction in long-day plants and presents a standard experimental design (the skeleton photoperiod) to test it. The problem is solvable through logical deduction from the provided biological principles. I will therefore proceed to derive the solution.\n\nThe central task is to determine the timing of a second light pulse, $t_2$, that maximizes flowering induction in a long-day plant. The mechanism for induction is governed by the external coincidence model, which, in molecular terms, requires the coincidence of light with a circadian-gated peak in the transcript abundance of the *CONSTANS* (*CO*) gene.\n\nThe fundamental principles are as follows:\n1.  The transcription of *CO* mRNA is controlled by the circadian clock. A light pulse at time $t=0$ entrains this clock, setting the \"subjective dawn.\"\n2.  The problem states that *CO* mRNA levels peak in the \"late subjective day\" under conditions that promote flowering. In canonical long-day plants like *Arabidopsis*, this corresponds to the timing of dusk in a long-day photoperiod (e.g., a 16-hour day). Thus, the peak of *CO* mRNA abundance is expected to occur approximately 16 hours after subjective dawn, which is at $t = 16$ h.\n3.  The CO protein is the direct activator of flowering. However, it is highly unstable in darkness, being targeted for proteasomal degradation. Light, perceived by photoreceptors, stabilizes the CO protein, allowing it to accumulate.\n4.  Flowering is induced via the activation of *FLOWERING LOCUS T* (*FT*) transcription by the accumulated CO protein.\n\nTo achieve robust flowering, a significant accumulation of functional CO protein is necessary. This requires two conditions to be met simultaneously: high levels of *CO* mRNA (the template for protein synthesis) and the presence of light (the agent for protein stabilization). The experiment provides light only at two times: $t=0$ and $t=t_2$.\n\nThe pulse at $t=0$ serves primarily to set the phase of the circadian clock. At this time (subjective dawn), *CO* mRNA levels are low, so this pulse does not lead to significant CO protein accumulation.\n\nThe effectiveness of the second pulse at $t=t_2$ in inducing flowering is therefore entirely dependent on its timing relative to the circadian peak of *CO* mRNA. To maximize the external coincidence, the pulse at $t=t_2$ must be delivered when *CO* mRNA levels are at their maximum. As established from principle 2, this peak occurs around $t=16$ h. A light pulse at this specific time will stabilize the CO protein precisely when its transcript is most abundant, leading to a surge in CO protein levels, strong activation of *FT*, and consequently, robust flowering induction. This two-pulse experiment effectively mimics the essential feature of a continuous long day of 16 hours.\n\nNow, I shall evaluate each option based on this deduction.\n\nA. Deliver the second pulse at $t=8$ h\nAt $t=8$ h, it is the middle of the subjective day. *CO* mRNA levels are rising but are far from their peak, which occurs in the late subjective day. A light pulse at this time would result in only a modest stabilization of CO protein, as the concentration of its template mRNA is suboptimal. This corresponds to an 8-hour day, which is a short day and non-inductive for a long-day plant.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nB. Deliver the second pulse at $t=12$ h\nAt $t=12$ h, it is the beginning of the late subjective day. *CO* mRNA levels are significantly higher than at $t=8$ h, but have not yet reached their circadian maximum. This timing simulates a 12-hour day, which is typically considered a neutral day length and is not strongly inductive for obligate long-day plants. The induction of flowering would be weaker than optimal.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Deliver the second pulse at $t=16$ h\nAt $t=16$ h, the time corresponds to the end of a long, 16-hour day. According to the provided principles, this is the time of the circadian peak for *CO* mRNA expression. Delivering a light pulse at $t=16$ h creates the perfect coincidence: light is provided exactly when the *CO* transcript is at its highest level. This maximizes CO protein stabilization and accumulation, leading to the strongest possible activation of *FT* and robust flowering.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. Deliver the second pulse at $t=20$ h\nAt $t=20$ h, the clock has progressed into the subjective night. *CO* mRNA levels, having peaked around $t=16$ h, are now in sharp decline. A light pulse at this time, although capable of stabilizing any CO protein present, would be largely ineffective because there is very little *CO* mRNA to be translated. The resulting CO protein accumulation would be minimal, and flowering induction would be weak.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2593182"}, {"introduction": "Having explored light perception and the logic of day-length measurement, we can now synthesize these concepts into a predictive, quantitative framework.
