In the absence of significant substrate load (so that catalytic turnover is negligible during the binding equilibration), the instantaneous catalytic capacity of the protease is proportional to the fraction of free enzyme. Assume the following biologically grounded fundamentals: (i) the Law of Mass Action holds for the binding equilibrium $E + I \\rightleftharpoons EI$, (ii) the inhibition constant $K_i$ equals the equilibrium dissociation constant defined by $K_i = [E][I]/[EI]$, and (iii) total concentrations are conserved, so $E_{\\mathrm{T}} = [E] + [EI]$ and $I_{\\mathrm{T}} = [I] + [EI]$.\n\nA larval midgut lumen contains the protease at total concentration $E_{\\mathrm{T}} = 50$ nM and the plant Kunitz inhibitor at total concentration $I_{\\mathrm{T}} = 100$ nM.

The definition of the inhibition constant, $K_i$, which is the dissociation constant for the $EI$ complex:\n$$K_i = \\frac{[E][I]}{[EI]} \\quad (1)$$\n\n$2$. The conservation of mass for the total enzyme concentration, $E_{\\mathrm{T}}$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{T}} = [E] + [EI] \\quad (2)$$\n\n$3$. The conservation of mass for the total inhibitor concentration, $I_{\\mathrm{T}}$:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{T}} = [I] + [EI] \\quad (3)$$\n\nHere, $[E]$, $[I]$, and $[EI]$ represent the equilibrium concentrations of the free enzyme, free inhibitor, and the enzyme-inhibitor complex, respectively. Our objective is to determine the fraction of free enzyme, $f = [E]/E_{\\mathrm{T}}$. This requires solving for the value of $[E]$.\n\nWe have a system of three equations with three unknowns: $[E]$, $[I]$, and $[EI]$. We can solve this system by expressing $[I]$ and $[EI]$ in terms of $[E]$ and the known total concentrations, $E_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and $I_{\\mathrm{T}}$.\n\nFrom the enzyme conservation equation $(2)$, we express $[EI]$ as a function of $[E]$:\n$$[EI] = E_{\\mathrm{T}} - [E] \\quad (4)$$\n\nNext, we substitute this expression for $[EI]$ into the inhibitor conservation equation $(3)$ to find an expression for $[I]$:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{T}} = [I] + (E_{\\mathrm{T}} - [E])$$\n$$[I] = I_{\\mathrm{T}} - E_{\\mathrm{T}} + [E] \\quad (5)$$\n\nNow we have expressions for both $[EI]$ and $[I]$ in terms of $[E]$.

This is a clear and strong activation of SA biosynthesis.\n    -   PR1 is a canonical marker gene for the SA signaling pathway. Its transcript abundance shows a robust and sustained induction in the local leaf, increasing monotonically to a $15.2$-fold change at $t=24$ h. This gene expression pattern is a direct consequence of the measured SA accumulation.\n    -   Crucially, at $t=48$ h, the distal (systemic) leaf exhibits a $5.3$-fold induction of PR1. This systemic induction of PR genes is the defining characteristic of Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR), a long-lasting, broad-spectrum immunity that is dependent on SA signaling.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Jasmonic Acid/Ethylene (JA/ET) Pathway**:\n    -   The JA/ET pathways are central to defense against necrotrophic pathogens and chewing herbivores.\n    -   JA-Ile is the bioactive conjugate of jasmonic acid. Its levels remain virtually constant throughout the experiment ($21$, $23$, and $19$ pmol g$^{-1}$). This indicates a lack of JA pathway activation.\n    -   Ethylene emission also shows no significant change ($1.0$ to $1.1$ nL g$^{-1}$ h$^{-1}$).\n    -   PDF1.2 is a canonical marker gene for the JA/ET signaling pathway. Its transcript abundance does not increase; it is slightly repressed, with levels fluctuating below the baseline ($0.8$, $0.6$, $0.7$, $0.9$). This suppression is consistent with the principle of SA-JA antagonism, where high levels of SA actively repress the JA pathway.\n    -   The systemic level of PDF1.2 at $t=48$ h is $1.1$, which represents a return to baseline, indicating no systemic activation of the JA/ET pathway.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Early Signaling**:\n    -   WRKY33 is a transcription factor involved in diverse stress responses. It is known to be rapidly and transiently induced during Pattern-Triggered Immunity (PTI), the first layer of defense triggered by recognition of conserved microbial patterns.\n    -   The data show WRKY33 transcripts peak early at $t=3$ h ($3.1$-fold induction) and then decline back toward baseline. This kinetic profile is characteristic of a general, early defense response like PTI, which precedes the full-blown, hormone-specific responses. This early signaling likely initiates the downstream SA accumulation.\n\n4.  **Synthesis**:\n    -   The collective data—strong SA accumulation, robust local and systemic PR1 induction, lack of JA-Ile/ET induction, and local suppression of PDF1.2—unequivocally point to an **SA-dominant immune response**.\n    -   The systemic induction of PR1 demonstrates the establishment of **Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR)**.\n    -   The transient WRKY33 induction signifies an initial **PTI** response.\n    -   The suppression of the JA/ET pathway markers is a classic example of **antagonistic cross-talk**.\n    -   This entire molecular phenotype is the textbook response of *Arabidopsis* to infection by a biotrophic or hemibiotrophic pathogen.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. SA-dominant immunity culminating in Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR): a hemibiotrophic or biotrophic challenge triggers Pattern-Triggered Immunity (PTI) and possibly Effector-Triggered Immunity (ETI), causing SA accumulation, Nonexpresser of Pathogenesis-Related genes 1 (NPR1)-dependent activation of PR genes, robust and systemic PR1 induction, transient early WRKY33 from general PTI signaling, and suppression of the JA/ET branch (low PDF1.2), with minimal changes in JA-Ile and ethylene.**\nThis option provides a complete and mechanistically accurate description that is perfectly consistent with all provided data. It correctly identifies the SA-dominant regime, the occurrence of SAR, the cause as a biotrophic/hemibiotrophic pathogen, the role of SA and PR1, the interpretation of the transient WRKY33 signal as part of PTI, and the suppression of the JA/ET pathway as evidenced by low PDF1.2 and stable JA-Ile/ET levels. The mention of NPR1 is correct, as it is the master regulator of SA-dependent PR gene expression.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. JA/ET-dominant immunity consistent with Induced Systemic Resistance (ISR): a chewing herbivore or necrotroph elevates JA/ET signaling, resulting in strong and sustained local PDF1.2 induction, little PR1 locally or systemically, increased JA-Ile and ethylene emission, and weak or absent systemic PR1.**\nThis option is in direct contradiction with the data. PDF1.2 is suppressed, not induced. PR1 is strongly induced locally and systemically. JA-Ile and ethylene do not increase. This describes a scenario that is the opposite of what was observed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Mixed regime with early JA/ET followed by SA: early WRKY33 indicates a JA/ET phase that induces PDF1.2, then SA rises later to induce PR1; systemic leaves show both PR1 and PDF1.2 at elevated levels due to coexistence of both pathways.**\nThis option incorrectly interprets the early WRKY33 induction as evidence for a JA/ET phase. There is no accompanying PDF1.2 induction; in fact, there is suppression. Furthermore, the systemic leaf does not show elevated PDF1.2, invalidating the claim of pathway coexistence at the systemic level.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. ET-dominant necrotroph defense driven by WRKY33: WRKY33 governs defenses and camalexin biosynthesis, so its early induction indicates ethylene-centric signaling that accounts for later PR1 increases as a nonspecific stress response; systemic leaves are expected to accumulate PDF1.2 rather than PR1 if the response is propagated.**\nThis option is flawed. There is no evidence for ET-dominance, as ethylene levels are stable. The strong, sustained SA accumulation and PR1 induction are specific, not a \"nonspecific stress response.\" The prediction that systemic leaves should accumulate PDF1.2 is contrary to the observation of strong PR1 induction.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2557394"}]}
