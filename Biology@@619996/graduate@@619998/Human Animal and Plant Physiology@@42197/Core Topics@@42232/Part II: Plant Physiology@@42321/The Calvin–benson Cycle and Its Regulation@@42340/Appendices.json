This transition point, or crossover, is found by equating the two limiting rates: $A_c = A_j$.\n\nFirst, we define the expression for the Rubisco-limited rate of net $CO_2$ assimilation, $A_c$. According to the principles of Michaelis–Menten kinetics with competitive inhibition of carboxylation by $O_2$, the gross rate of carboxylation, $v_c$, is given by:\n$$\nv_c = \\frac{V_{\\max} C_i}{C_i + K_c \\left(1 + \\frac{O}{K_o}\\right)}\n$$\nwhere $V_{\\max}$ is the maximum carboxylation capacity, $K_c$ and $K_o$ are the Michaelis constants for $CO_2$ and $O_2$ respectively, and $O$ is the partial pressure of oxygen. The net assimilation rate, $A$, must account for carbon losses due to photorespiration, which is represented by the $CO_2$ compensation point in the absence of mitochondrial respiration, $\\Gamma^{\\ast}$. The relation between net assimilation and gross carboxylation is $A = v_c(1 - \\Gamma^{\\ast}/C_i)$. Therefore, the Rubisco-limited net assimilation rate, $A_c$, is:\n$$\nA_c = \\frac{V_{\\max} C_i}{C_i + K_c \\left(1 + \\frac{O}{K_o}\\right)} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Gamma^{\\ast}}{C_i}\\right) = \\frac{V_{\\max} (C_i - \\Gamma^{\\ast})}{C_i + K_c \\left(1 + \\frac{O}{K_o}\\right)}\n$$\n\nSecond, we define the expression for the RuBP regeneration-limited rate of net $CO_2$ assimilation, $A_j$. This rate is determined by the potential rate of electron transport, $J$. The electron transport chain provides ATP and NADPH required to regenerate RuBP consumed in both carboxylation and oxygenation reactions.

The same set of $C_i$ values, $\\{10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 600\\}$ Pa, is used for all cases.\n\nThird, for each dataset, the `scipy.optimize.minimize` function is used to find the optimal parameters $\\hat{V}_{c,\\max}$ and $\\hat{J}_{\\max}$ that minimize the SSR. The L-BFGS-B algorithm is chosen for this task as it is well-suited for bound-constrained optimization. The lower bound for both parameters is set to a small positive number to enforce the positivity constraint.\n\nFinally, after obtaining the fitted parameters ($\\hat{V}_{c,\\max}^{(k)}, \\hat{J}_{\\max}^{(k)}$) for each case $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, we perform the specified interpretation. The baseline case, $k=1$, is assigned a limitation shift code $L^{(1)}=0$. For cases $k \\in \\{2, 3\\}$, the relative changes in the fitted parameters with respect to the baseline are calculated:\n$$\n\\Delta_V^{(k)} = \\left|\\frac{\\hat V_{c,\\max}^{(k)} - \\hat V_{c,\\max}^{(1)}}{\\hat V_{c,\\max}^{(1)}}\\right| \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Delta_J^{(k)} = \\left|\\frac{\\hat J_{\\max}^{(k)} - \\hat J_{\\max}^{(1)}}{\\hat J_{\\max}^{(1)}}\\right|\n$$\nThe limitation shift code $L^{(k)}$ is then determined based on a comparison of these relative changes against a tolerance $\\epsilon = 0.02$: $L^{(k)}=1$ if the change in $V_{c,\\max}$ is dominant, $L^{(k)}=2$ if the change in $J_{\\max}$ is dominant, and $L^{(k)}=0$ otherwise.\n\nThe results, consisting of the fitted parameters rounded to three decimal places and the integer limitation code for each of the three cases, are compiled and printed in the specified format. Since the input data are generated from the model without noise, the fitting procedure is expected to recover the original true parameters with high precision.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the FvCB model parameterization problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n    # 1.
