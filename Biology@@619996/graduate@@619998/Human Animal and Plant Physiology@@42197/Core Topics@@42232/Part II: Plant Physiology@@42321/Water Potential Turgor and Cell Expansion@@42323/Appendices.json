The problem is free from contradictions, ambiguities, and factual unsoundness.\n\nWe now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem describes the viscoplastic extension of a plant cell wall. The instantaneous relative extension rate, or strain rate, of the cell's length $L$ is given by $\\frac{1}{L}\\frac{dL}{dt}$. According to the problem statement, this rate is proportional to the amount by which the turgor pressure $P$ exceeds the yield threshold $Y$. The constant of proportionality is the wall extensibility $\\phi$. This relationship holds only for $P > Y$. If $P \\le Y$, the irreversible extension rate is zero. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{L}\\frac{dL}{dt} = \\phi \\cdot \\max(0, P(t) - Y)\n$$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation for the length $L(t)$. We can solve it by separating variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{L} = \\phi \\cdot \\max(0, P(t) - Y) dt\n$$\nTo find the length $L(t_f)$ at a final time $t_f$ starting from an initial length $L_0$ at time $t_0$, we integrate both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\int_{L_0}^{L(t_f)} \\frac{dL}{L} = \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\phi \\cdot \\max(0, P(t) - Y) dt\n$$\nThe left-hand side integrates to $\\ln(L(t_f)) - \\ln(L_0) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{L(t_f)}{L_0}\\right)$.

A complete, reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\nThe water potential in the apoplastic sap column, $\\psi_{\\mathrm{out}}$, varies with height due to gravity. The problem statement requires a derivation of this relationship from first principles.\n\nThe core physical principle is that a column of fluid in a gravitational field is in hydrostatic equilibrium. This dictates that the pressure decreases with height according to the relation:\n$$ \\frac{dP_{\\mathrm{out}}}{dz} = -\\rho g $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density of the fluid (apoplastic sap) and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

Assuming the solute potential of the apoplastic sap does not change with height, the change in water potential is driven entirely by the change in pressure. Thus:\n$$ \\psi_{out}(h) - \\psi_{out}(0) = P_{out}(h) - P_{out}(0) = -\\rho g h $$\nWith $\\psi_{out}(0) = \\psi_0$, this gives:\n$$ \\psi_{\\mathrm{out}}(h) = \\psi_0 - \\rho g h $$\nThe term $-\\rho g h$ is the gravitational contribution to the water potential difference between height $h$ and the base.\n\nAt steady state, the cell at height $h$ is in hydraulic equilibrium with the surrounding apoplast, meaning their water potentials are equal:\n$$ \\psi_{\\mathrm{in}}(h) = \\psi_{\\mathrm{out}}(h) $$\nThe internal water potential of the cell, $\\psi_{\\mathrm{in}}(h)$, is given by the sum of its turgor pressure, $P(h)$, and its internal osmotic potential, $\\pi_i$:\n$$ \\psi_{\\mathrm{in}}(h) = P(h) + \\pi_i $$\nBy combining these equations, we can express the cell's turgor pressure as a function of height:\n$$ P(h) + \\pi_i = \\psi_0 - \\rho g h $$\n$$ P(h) = \\psi_0 - \\pi_i - \\rho g h $$\nThis equation shows that turgor pressure decreases linearly with height.\n\nThe condition for irreversible cell expansion (growth) is that the turgor pressure must be greater than or equal to the wall yield threshold, $Y$:\n$$ P(h) \\geq Y $$\nThe maximum height, $h_{\\max}$, at which growth can occur corresponds to the point where the turgor pressure is just equal to the yield threshold:\n$$ P(h_{\\max}) = Y $$\nSubstituting this condition into our expression for turgor pressure:\n$$ Y = \\psi_0 - \\pi_i - \\rho g h_{\\max} $$\nWe now solve this equation for $h_{\\max}$:\n$$ \\rho g h_{\\max} = \\psi_0 - \\pi_i - Y $$\n$$ h_{\\max} = \\frac{\\psi_0 - \\pi_i - Y}{\\rho g} $$\nThis is the final symbolic expression for the maximum height for cell expansion.\n\nWe are given the following numerical values:\n- $\\psi_{0} = -0.10\\ \\mathrm{MPa} = -0.10 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n- $\\pi_{i} = -0.80\\ \\mathrm{MPa} = -0.80 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n- $Y = 0.20\\ \\mathrm{MPa} = 0.20 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n- $\\rho = 1000\\ \\mathrm{kg\\ m^{-3}}$\n- $g = 9.81\\ \\mathrm{m\\ s^{-2}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $h_{\\max}$:\n$$ h_{\\max} = \\frac{(-0.10 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{Pa}) - (-0.80 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{Pa}) - (0.20 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{Pa})}{(1000\\ \\mathrm{kg\\ m^{-3}}) \\times (9.81\\ \\mathrm{m\\ s^{-2}})} $$\n$$ h_{\\max} = \\frac{(-0.10 + 0.80 - 0.20) \\times 10^6}{9810}\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ h_{\\max} = \\frac{0.50 \\times 10^6}{9810}\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ h_{\\max} = \\frac{500000}{9810}\\ \\mathrm{m} \\approx 50.96839959\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required by the problem statement gives:\n$$ h_{\\max} \\approx 50.97\\ \\mathrm{m} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{50.97}$$", "id": "2623625"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical models are only as powerful as our ability to measure their parameters.
