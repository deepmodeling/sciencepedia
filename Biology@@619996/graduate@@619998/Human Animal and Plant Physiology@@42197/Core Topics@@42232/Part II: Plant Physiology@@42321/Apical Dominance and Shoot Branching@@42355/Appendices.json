This exercise guides you through the process of operationalizing the concept of apical dominance by creating a simple, dimensionless index.

Consider a standard assay in which each node bears one axillary position capable of forming a branch if not suppressed. Suppose the apical dominance index (ADI) is operationally defined as the complement of the fraction of axillary positions that bear an active branch. In other words, the index is constructed so that it equals $1$ when no axillary positions are active and equals $0$ when all axillary positions are active, with intermediate values reflecting partial suppression.\n\nYou have a plant with $N = 30$ nodes. After three different physiological treatments (A, B, and C), the observed numbers of active branches are $B_{\\mathrm{A}} = 3$, $B_{\\mathrm{B}} = 6$, and $B_{\\mathrm{C}} = 12$, respectively.

No units are required.

An operational index to quantify dominance should map the observed fraction of axillary positions that are active branches to a measure of suppression, with the following foundational constraints: if the fraction of active branching across all axillary positions equals $0$ (no branches), the index should equal $1$ (complete suppression), and if the fraction equals $1$ (all positions branched), the index should equal $0$ (no suppression). The simplest such mapping that is linear in the fraction is to take the complement of the branching fraction.\n\nLet $N$ denote the total number of axillary positions and $B$ denote the number of active branches.

A common horticultural intervention is to apply an auxin-containing lanolin paste to a target node to reestablish apical dominance and suppress bud outgrowth. Consider a stem segment where node 3 has been decapitated proximal to the node, such that endogenous auxin flux from the apex is negligible at node 3. The local inhibitory signal controlling bud activation at node 3 is assumed to be proportional to the fractional activation of an auxin signaling module, which is well described by a Hill-type dose–response relation grounded in receptor occupancy and cooperative transcriptional responses.

By carefully considering the distinct kinetics of each reporter, you will deconvolve the temporal sequence of signaling events that orchestrate bud release, learning to distinguish causal relationships from mere correlation in a dynamic system [@problem_id:2549309].", "problem": "A laboratory investigates the causal sequence of events that release axillary buds from apical dominance in Arabidopsis thaliana after shoot decapitation. The team uses four genetically encoded readouts, each tied to a distinct signaling axis, imaged in the same buds over time. The readouts are defined as follows.\n\n- DR5rev::3xVENUS (DR5): a synthetic auxin response reporter whose promoter consists of Auxin Response Factor (ARF) binding sites. Its fluorescence reflects transcriptional output of auxin-responsive gene expression, not auxin concentration per se. Fluorophore maturation time for VENUS is approximately $t_m^{\\mathrm{VENUS}} \\approx 7$ min, and the reporter protein degradation half-life is approximately $t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{rep}} \\approx 180$ min.\n\n- TCSn::VENUS (TCSn): a cytokinin response reporter whose promoter encodes an optimized type-B Arabidopsis Response Regulator (ARR) binding array. As with DR5, it reports transcriptional output of cytokinin signaling. The same VENUS maturation time $t_m^{\\mathrm{VENUS}} \\approx 7$ min and reporter protein degradation half-life $t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{rep}} \\approx 180$ min apply.\n\n- pSWEET::sfGFP (pSWEET): a sugar-responsive promoter (from a Sucrose Transporter family gene) fused to superfolder Green Fluorescent Protein (sfGFP). Its fluorescence reports sugar-responsive transcription, not sugar concentration directly. sfGFP maturation time is approximately $t_m^{\\mathrm{sfGFP}} \\approx 6$ min, and reporter protein degradation half-life is approximately $t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{rep}} \\approx 180$ min.\n\n- D53/SMXL degradation sensor (D53–mScarlet-I): a strigolactone (SL) signaling readout in which a SL pathway repressor (for example, D53 or SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1-LIKE (SMXL) protein) is fused to a fluorescent protein. When the SL receptor pathway (DWARF14–MORE AXILLARY GROWTH2) is active, the fusion protein is polyubiquitylated and degraded by the proteasome. The fluorophore maturation time for mScarlet-I is approximately $t_m^{\\mathrm{mSc}} \\approx 36$ min. In the SL “on” state, the degradation half-life of the fusion is approximately $t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{D53,on}} \\approx 5$ min; in the SL “off” state, the effective degradation half-life is approximately $t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{D53,off}} \\approx 120$ min.\n\nFundamental bases for interpretation:\n\n- For promoter-driven reporters such as DR5, TCSn, and pSWEET, fluorescence $F(t)$ reflects transcriptional output convolved with fluorophore maturation and protein turnover. If promoter activity increases at time $t_0$, an increase in $F(t)$ cannot appear earlier than approximately $t_0 + t_m$, and the rise is further shaped by the protein half-life.\n\n- For degradation sensors such as D53–mScarlet-I, fluorescence $D(t)$ obeys a production–degradation balance $dD/dt = s - k_{\\mathrm{deg}}(t) D$, where $s$ is synthesis and $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}(t)$ is high when SL signaling is active and low when inactive. Activation of SL signaling produces a rapid decrease in $D(t)$ limited by the short half-life $t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{D53,on}}$, whereas inactivation produces a delayed increase limited by fluorophore maturation and the longer half-life $t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{D53,off}}$.\n\nExperimental design and observations:\n\n- At time $t=0$ min the primary shoot apex is removed (decapitation). In the axillary bud closest to the cut, time-lapse imaging reveals the following onset times for detectable fluorescence changes: pSWEET increases at $t \\approx 20$ min; TCSn increases at $t \\approx 35$ min; D53–mScarlet-I begins a monotonic increase at $t \\approx 70$ min; DR5 increases in the bud at $t \\approx 90$ min.\n\n- At time $t=40$ min, a microdroplet of the synthetic strigolactone analog GR24 is applied directly to the bud. D53–mScarlet-I fluorescence drops by approximately $50\\%$ within $10$ min of application.\n\n- In a separate treatment, the auxin transport inhibitor N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) is applied to the stem at $t=-30$ min, and a sucrose pulse is supplied to the subtending leaf at $t=0$ min. Under these conditions, TCSn increases at $t \\approx 25$ min in the bud, but DR5 in the bud does not increase until $t \\approx 120$ min.\n\nAssume that the only substantive changes in maturation times and half-lives are those stated above, that imaging sensitivity is sufficient to detect changes as soon as they occur subject to these kinetic constraints, and that there are no off-target pharmacological effects beyond the canonical mechanisms.\n\nWhich of the following interpretations are justified by these data and the biophysical logic of the reporters?\n\nA. After accounting for reporter kinetics, the earliest upstream change that can be inferred from these readouts is an increase in sugar availability in the bud, as indicated by the pSWEET rise.\n\nB. The DR5 rise at $t \\approx 90$ min demonstrates that a local auxin maximum is the initiating trigger for bud release; moreover, DR5 directly measures intracellular auxin concentration.\n\nC. The rapid D53–mScarlet-I decrease within $10$ min of GR24 application is direct evidence that the strigolactone perception–degradation module is activated; this readout reflects pathway activity rather than endogenous ligand concentration.\n\nD. Unchanged DR5 fluorescence in the internode implies that polar auxin transport is unaffected by NPA, because DR5 directly quantifies transport rates in the vasculature.\n\nE. The sequence in which TCSn rises before the D53–mScarlet-I increase proves that cytokinin directly inhibits the strigolactone receptor DWARF14 (D14).\n\nF. The observation that NPA plus sucrose elicits an early TCSn rise without any early change in DR5 in the bud supports a model in which sugar and cytokinin can initiate bud activation upstream of auxin export from the bud, with the later DR5 increase being a consequence of growth rather than its cause.\n\nSelect all that apply.

The language is objective and precise.\n\nThe problem is self-contained and free from internal contradictions. The assumptions are clearly stated to constrain the interpretation. It does not violate any fundamental principles of biology, chemistry, or physics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nBefore evaluating the options, we must first infer the timing of the underlying biological events from the observed fluorescence changes, accounting for the specified reporter kinetics.\n\n**Inferred Timing of Biological Events (Decapitation Experiment):**\n\n-   **Sugar Response (pSWEET):** The reporter shows an increase at $t_{obs} \\approx 20$ min. ThesfGFP fluorophore requires $t_m^{\\mathrm{sfGFP}} \\approx 6$ min to mature. Therefore, the onset of sugar-responsive transcription must occur at or before $t_{signal} = t_{obs} - t_m^{\\mathrm{sfGFP}} \\approx 20 - 6 = 14$ min.\n\n-   **Cytokinin Response (TCSn):** The reporter shows an increase at $t_{obs} \\approx 35$ min. The VENUS fluorophore requires $t_m^{\\mathrm{VENUS}} \\approx 7$ min to mature. The onset of cytokinin-responsive transcription is inferred to be at or before $t_{signal} = t_{obs} - t_m^{\\mathrm{VENUS}} \\approx 35 - 7 = 28$ min.\n\n-   **Strigolactone Response (D53–mScarlet-I):** The reporter shows an *increase* in fluorescence at $t_{obs} \\approx 70$ min. An increase signifies the *inactivation* of SL signaling, allowing the D53–mScarlet-I fusion protein to accumulate. The appearance of new, mature fluorescent protein is limited by the maturation time of mScarlet-I, $t_m^{\\mathrm{mSc}} \\approx 36$ min. Thus, the inactivation of the SL signaling pathway must have occurred at or before $t_{signal} = t_{obs} - t_m^{\\mathrm{mSc}} \\approx 70 - 36 = 34$ min.\n\n-   **Auxin Response (DR5):** The reporter shows an increase at $t_{obs} \\approx 90$ min. Using the VENUS maturation time $t_m^{\\mathrm{VENUS}} \\approx 7$ min, the onset of auxin-responsive transcription must be at or before $t_{signal} = t_{obs} - t_m^{\\mathrm{VENUS}} \\approx 90 - 7 = 83$ min.\n\n**Summary of Inferred Event Sequence:**\n1.  Increase in sugar signaling: $t \\approx 14$ min\n2.  Increase in cytokinin signaling: $t \\approx 28$ min\n3.  Decrease in strigolactone signaling: $t \\approx 34$ min\n4.  Increase in auxin signaling: $t \\approx 83$ min\n\nThis temporal sequence of signaling events, derived by deconvolving the reporter kinetics, forms the basis for evaluating the options.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. After accounting for reporter kinetics, the earliest upstream change that can be inferred from these readouts is an increase in sugar availability in the bud, as indicated by the pSWEET rise.**\nOur analysis shows the inferred onset of sugar-responsive transcription is at $t \\approx 14$ min. This precedes the inferred onsets of cytokinin response ($t \\approx 28$ min), strigolactone-response change ($t \\approx 34$ min), and auxin response ($t \\approx 83$ min). The statement correctly notes that this is the earliest change *inferred from these readouts*. Physiologically, decapitation removes the primary sink for sucrose, leading to its accumulation in axillary buds, so this rapid response is expected. The statement is a correct and cautious interpretation of the data.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The DR5 rise at $t \\approx 90$ min demonstrates that a local auxin maximum is the initiating trigger for bud release; moreover, DR5 directly measures intracellular auxin concentration.**\nThis statement makes two claims. First, it posits the DR5 rise as the \"initiating trigger.\" Our kinetic analysis shows that the auxin response (inferred at $t \\approx 83$ min) is the *last* of the four measured events. It cannot be the initiator if it is preceded by sugar, cytokinin, and strigolactone signaling changes. Second, the statement claims \"DR5 directly measures intracellular auxin concentration.\" The problem statement explicitly contradicts this: \"Its fluorescence reflects transcriptional output of auxin-responsive gene expression, not auxin concentration per se.\" Both claims are demonstrably false based on the provided information.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The rapid D53–mScarlet-I decrease within $10$ min of GR24 application is direct evidence that the strigolactone perception–degradation module is activated; this readout reflects pathway activity rather than endogenous ligand concentration.**\nThe application of the SL analog GR24 activates the SL signaling pathway. This activation leads to the targeted degradation of the D53 repressor, which is fused to mScarlet-I. The degradation half-life in the active (\"on\") state is given as $t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{D53,on}} \\approx 5$ min. A drop of $\\approx 50\\%$ in $10$ min is fully consistent with this rapid degradation. The time for a $50\\%$ drop is on the order of one to two half-lives. This experiment confirms the sensor's functionality. The statement that the readout reflects \"pathway activity\" (i.e., the state of the degradation machinery) rather than ligand concentration itself is a precise description of how such a sensor works. The sensor measures the consequence of ligand-receptor interaction, not the ligand itself.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Unchanged DR5 fluorescence in the internode implies that polar auxin transport is unaffected by NPA, because DR5 directly quantifies transport rates in the vasculature.**\nThis statement is flawed on multiple levels. First, N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) is a potent and specific inhibitor of polar auxin transport; it is a fundamental tool used for this purpose. To claim transport is \"unaffected by NPA\" is a contradiction of established pharmacology, which the problem assumes to be canonical. Second, DR5 is a reporter of auxin-responsive *transcription*, not a direct quantifier of auxin *transport rates*. While changes in transport affect local auxin levels and thus downstream DR5 activity, the reporter does not measure flux. The premise and the reasoning are both incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The sequence in which TCSn rises before the D53–mScarlet-I increase proves that cytokinin directly inhibits the strigolactone receptor DWARF14 (D14).**\nOur analysis confirms the temporal sequence: cytokinin signaling increases ($t \\approx 28$ min) before strigolactone signaling decreases ($t \\approx 34$ min). However, to claim this timing \"proves\" a \"direct\" molecular inhibition of the D14 receptor is an over-interpretation. Correlation in time does not prove direct causation. The observed temporal relationship is consistent with a model where cytokinin signaling negatively regulates strigolactone signaling, but the mechanism could be indirect, for example, by cytokinin-dependent regulation of SL biosynthesis or catabolism genes, which would then lead to lower SL levels and reduced signaling. The problem explicitly cautions against such inferential leaps.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. The observation that NPA plus sucrose elicits an early TCSn rise without any early change in DR5 in the bud supports a model in which sugar and cytokinin can initiate bud activation upstream of auxin export from the bud, with the later DR5 increase being a consequence of growth rather than its cause.**\nThis statement correctly synthesizes the results of Experiment 3. By applying NPA, the canonical suppressive signal from apical auxin is blocked. The subsequent sucrose pulse then triggers a rapid cytokinin response (TCSn increase at $t \\approx 25$ min), while the auxin response (DR5) is delayed until $t \\approx 120$ min. This strongly supports a model where sugar availability, in the absence of the main polar auxin stream, is an upstream activating signal that acts together with or stimulates cytokinin signaling. This initiation occurs long before the bud itself begins to generate a strong local auxin signal (reported by DR5). The late DR5 signal is logically interpreted as a consequence of the new bud activating, growing, and becoming an auxin-producing source itself, rather than being the initial trigger for its own release. This interpretation is consistent with all presented data.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nFinal summary of correct options: A, C, F.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACF}$$", "id": "2549309"}]}
