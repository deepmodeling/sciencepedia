By analyzing a hypothetical gain-of-function mutant, you will dissect which aspects of symbiosis are programmed entirely within the plant's genome and which absolutely require the physical presence of the microbial partner, a crucial distinction for understanding symbiotic evolution and engineering. [@problem_id:2551990]", "problem": "A legume root requires a Common Symbiosis Signaling Pathway (CSSP) to coordinate both rhizobial nodulation and arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM). In this pathway, microbe-derived lipochitooligosaccharides trigger receptor-mediated events that produce nucleus-localized calcium oscillations, which are then decoded by Calcium and Calmodulin-dependent Protein Kinase (CCaMK). Activated CCaMK phosphorylates downstream targets, ultimately engaging transcriptional programs that include the Nodule Inception (NIN) regulator for nodulation and Required for Arbuscule Development One (RAM1) for AM. Early Nodulin (ENOD) genes, such as ENOD11 and ENOD40, are commonly used as nodulation markers; AM accommodation is often monitored by the Phosphate Transporter 4 (PT4), which is typically expressed in arbuscule-containing cortical cells. Consider a legume line that carries a gain-of-function allele of CCaMK under its native promoter, rendering the kinase constitutively active and largely independent of calcium oscillations. Plants are grown axenically, without any rhizobia or fungi, under nutrient conditions that do not strongly repress symbiotic gene expression. Based on the role of CCaMK as a decoder of calcium signatures for the CSSP, and the division of labor between plant-organized organogenesis versus microbe-dependent intracellular structures, choose the single option that best predicts the anatomical outcomes and expression patterns of symbiosis marker genes in these sterile roots.\n\nA. Constitutive CCaMK activity bypasses upstream perception, triggering spontaneous cortical cell divisions and nodule-like organogenesis without infection threads; nodulation markers NIN and ENOD11/ENOD40 are upregulated.

Microbe-derived lipochitooligosaccharides trigger receptor-mediated events.\n    $2$. This produces nucleus-localized calcium ($\\text{Ca}^{2+}$) oscillations.\n    $3$. The oscillations are decoded by Calcium and Calmodulin-dependent Protein Kinase ($\\text{CCaMK}$).\n    $4$. Activated $\\text{CCaMK}$ phosphorylates targets, leading to transcriptional changes.\n- **Downstream Regulators**:\n    - Nodulation: Nodule Inception ($\\text{NIN}$) regulator.\n    - $\\text{AM}$: Required for Arbuscule Development One ($\\text{RAM}1$).\n- **Marker Genes**:\n    - Nodulation: Early Nodulin genes $\\text{ENOD}11$ and $\\text{ENOD}40$.\n    - $\\text{AM}$ Accommodation: Phosphate Transporter $4$ ($\\text{PT}4$), expressed in arbuscule-containing cells.\n- **Genetic Modification**: The legume line has a gain-of-function allele of $\\text{CCaMK}$, making it constitutively active and largely independent of $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ oscillations.\n- **Experimental Conditions**: Plants are grown axenically (sterile, without rhizobia or fungi). Nutrient levels do not strongly repress symbiotic gene expression.\n- **Question**: Predict the anatomical outcomes and gene expression patterns in these sterile roots.\n- **Implicit Premise**: The problem distinguishes between plant-organized organogenesis and microbe-dependent intracellular structures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is scrutinized for validity.\n1.  **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is scientifically sound. The $\\text{CSSP}$, the roles of $\\text{CCaMK}$, $\\text{NIN}$, $\\text{RAM}1$, and the described marker genes are all well-established concepts and components in the field of plant-microbe interactions, particularly in model legumes like *Medicago truncatula*. The experimental creation of a constitutively active $\\text{CCaMK}$ and its resulting \"spontaneous nodulation\" phenotype is a known discovery in this field.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It presents a clear initial condition (a specific genetic mutation) in a defined biological context (sterile legume root) and asks for a predictable outcome based on the provided, accurate signaling pathway. A unique solution can be derived from these premises.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is precise, technical, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. It provides the necessary components of the signaling pathway and the nature of the genetic perturbation to reason toward a solution. There are no internal contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formulated question based on established principles of molecular genetics and plant biology. I will now proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe central premise is that a gain-of-function mutation in the $\\text{CCaMK}$ gene renders the kinase constitutively active. $\\text{CCaMK}$ acts as a central decoder of symbiotic signals, positioned downstream of microbe perception and the resulting $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ signature, but upstream of the transcriptional regulators that execute the symbiotic programs.\n\n$1$. **Bypass of Upstream Requirements**: A constitutively active $\\text{CCaMK}$ bypasses the need for all upstream events: microbial signal perception, secondary messenger production, and $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ oscillation decoding. The cell's signaling network will behave as if a valid symbiotic signal has been continuously perceived and processed, even under sterile conditions.\n\n$2$. **Activation of Downstream Pathways**: According to the problem, activated $\\text{CCaMK}$ initiates transcriptional programs for both nodulation (via $\\text{NIN}$) and $\\text{AM}$ symbiosis (via $\\text{RAM}1$). Therefore, in the mutant, even without microbes, we must expect the activation of both branches of the $\\text{CSSP}$. This will lead to the upregulation of the master regulators $\\text{NIN}$ and $\\text{RAM}1$, and consequently their downstream target genes. Specifically, nodulation markers like $\\text{ENOD}11$ and $\\text{ENOD}40$ should be expressed.\n\n$3$. **Anatomical and Developmental Consequences**: It is crucial to distinguish between developmental programs that are fully encoded by the plant genome (organogenesis) and structures that depend on the physical presence and activity of the microbial symbiont.\n    - **Nodulation**: The formation of a nodule is an act of organogenesis. The plant genome contains the complete \"blueprint\" to reprogram cortical cells to divide and differentiate into a new organ. As this program is downstream of $\\text{CCaMK}$, its constitutive activation is sufficient to trigger spontaneous cortical cell divisions and the formation of nodule-like structures, or \"pseudonodules\". However, structures directly associated with bacterial accommodation, such as the infection thread which guides bacteria into the plant tissue, require the physical presence of the bacteria. In a sterile environment, no infection threads will form. Furthermore, nitrogen fixation is a biochemical process carried out by the bacterial enzyme nitrogenase. In axenic culture, there are no bacteria, and thus no bacterial genes will be expressed and no nitrogen fixation will occur.\n    - **Arbuscular Mycorrhiza**: The arbuscule is a finely branched hyphal structure of the fungus that grows *inside* a plant root cortical cell. The plant cell dramatically reorganizes its endomembrane system and plasma membrane to accommodate this foreign structure, forming the periarbuscular membrane. While the plant's transcriptional program (initiated by $\\text{CCaMK}$ and $\\text{RAM}1$) prepares the cell for this accommodation, the arbuscule itself is a fungal structure. Without the fungus, no arbuscule can possibly form. The marker gene $\\text{PT}4$ is described as being expressed in **arbuscule-containing** cortical cells, indicating its expression is tightly linked to the successful, mature state of intracellular accommodation. Therefore, while early transcriptional responses like $\\text{RAM}1$ expression may be activated, the specific markers for a functional, developed arbuscule like $\\text{PT}4$ are not expected to be strongly induced.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation**: In the sterile roots of a legume with a constitutively active $\\text{CCaMK}$, one should observe spontaneous formation of nodule-like organs and expression of early nodulation genes. The early stages of the $\\text{AM}$ pathway will also be activated at the transcriptional level, but no arbuscules will form, and markers for mature arbuscules will not be expressed. No bacterial processes will occur.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Constitutive CCaMK activity bypasses upstream perception, triggering spontaneous cortical cell divisions and nodule-like organogenesis without infection threads; nodulation markers NIN and ENOD11/ENOD40 are upregulated. The AM transcriptional program is ectopically engaged at the level of regulators such as RAM1, but fully differentiated arbuscule-like intracellular trees do not develop in the absence of fungi, and arbuscule-specific transporter PT4 shows little to no robust induction. No microbial genes, such as bacterial nitrogenase, are expressed.**\nThis option aligns perfectly with the derived conclusions. It correctly identifies the bypass of upstream signaling, the spontaneous initiation of plant-driven organogenesis (nodulation), the absence of microbe-dependent structures (infection threads, arbuscules), the expected pattern of gene expression (upregulation of early markers like $\\text{NIN}$ and $\\text{ENOD}$s but not late/structure-dependent markers like $\\text{PT}4$), and the absence of microbial gene expression.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. No symbiotic structures or gene-expression changes occur because nuclear calcium oscillations strictly require microbial signals and cannot be bypassed; therefore constitutive CCaMK has no effect in the absence of microbes.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The very definition of a \"constitutively active\" gain-of-function protein is that it is active *without* its normal activation signal. It therefore *does* bypass the need for calcium oscillations. The premise is incorrect, and so is the conclusion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Fully functional nodules with effective nitrogen fixation develop, including leghemoglobin accumulation and expression of bacterial nitrogenase, even without microbes, because constitutive CCaMK activation is sufficient for the entire nodulation program.**\nThis is incorrect. The plant cannot perform nitrogen fixation or express bacterial genes like nitrogenase on its own. These functions are exclusive to the rhizobial symbiont. The experiment is conducted under sterile conditions, so no bacteria are present.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Only AM-related outcomes occur: arbuscule-like intracellular structures form spontaneously with high PT4 expression, whereas nodulation markers such as NIN and ENOD11 remain uninduced because nodulation requires bacterial Nod factor perception regardless of downstream pathway activation.**\nThis statement contains multiple errors. First, $\\text{CCaMK}$ is part of a *common* pathway, so it is incorrect to state that only $\\text{AM}$-related outcomes would occur. Nodulation pathways downstream of $\\text{CCaMK}$ (involving $\\text{NIN}$) would also be activated. Second, arbuscules are fungal structures and cannot form \"spontaneously\" without the fungus. Third, high $\\text{PT}4$ expression is linked to the presence of mature arbuscules, which will be absent. The entire reasoning is flawed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2551990"}, {"introduction": "Biological nitrogen fixation is one of the most energy-intensive processes in biology, with its cost dictated by the specific biochemistry of the nitrogenase enzyme.

This leads to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{legume}}}{1000} = f\\frac{\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{B}}{1000} + \\frac{\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{1000} - f\\frac{\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{1000}\n$$\nMultiplying the entire equation by $1000$ eliminates the denominators.\n$$\n\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{legume}} = f\\,\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{B} + \\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{ref}} - f\\,\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{ref}}\n$$\nWe now solve for $f$ by isolating terms containing $f$.\n$$\n\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{legume}} - \\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{ref}} = f\\,\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{B} - f\\,\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{ref}}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{legume}} - \\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{ref}} = f(\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{B} - \\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{ref}})\n$$\nThis yields the final expression for $f$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{legume}} - \\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{B} - \\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\n$$\nThis is the required expression for Ndfa in terms of the isotopic signatures. Note that due to the structure of the fraction, the permil unit ($\\permil$) is irrelevant as it cancels out, leaving $f$ as a dimensionless quantity.\n\nNext, we calculate the numerical value of $f$ using the provided data:\n$\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{legume}} = -1.5$\n$\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 4.0$\n$\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{B} = -2.0$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\nf = \\frac{-1.5 - 4.0}{-2.0 - 4.0}\n$$\n$$\nf = \\frac{-5.5}{-6.0}\n$$\n$$\nf = \\frac{5.5}{6.0} \\approx 0.91666...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first significant figure is $9$. The fourth significant figure is $6$. The subsequent digit is $6$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$\nf \\approx 0.9167\n$$\nThis value indicates that approximately $91.67\\%$ of the nitrogen in the legume is derived from atmospheric fixation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9167}$$", "id": "2552012"}]}
