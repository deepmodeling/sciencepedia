The problem is well-posed, providing a clear set of tasks, all necessary data, and a logical path from derivation to calculation. It is objective and free of ambiguity. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nDerivation of Osmotic Pressure:\nConsider a system at temperature $T$ where a compartment of pure water (solvent, denoted by subscript $w$) at pressure $P$ is separated by a semipermeable membrane from a solution containing a non-volatile solute (subscript $s$) at pressure $P+\\Pi$. The membrane is permeable only to the solvent. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the chemical potential of the solvent, $\\mu_w$, must be equal on both sides of the membrane.\n\nLet $\\mu_w^0(P)$ denote the chemical potential of pure water at pressure $P$. Let $\\mu_w(P+\\Pi, x_w)$ denote the chemical potential of water in the solution, where $x_w$ is the mole fraction of water and the total pressure is $P+\\Pi$. The equilibrium condition is:\n$$\n\\mu_w^0(P) = \\mu_w(P+\\Pi, x_w)\n$$\nThe chemical potential of the solvent in a solution is related to the chemical potential of the pure solvent at the same pressure by the definition of solvent activity, $a_w$:\n$$\n\\mu_w(P+\\Pi, x_w) = \\mu_w^0(P+\\Pi) + RT \\ln(a_w)\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant. For an ideal solution, the activity of the solvent is equal to its mole fraction, $a_w = x_w$. The equilibrium equation thus becomes:\n$$\n\\mu_w^0(P) = \\mu_w^0(P+\\Pi) + RT \\ln(x_w)\n$$\nRearranging this gives:\n$$\n\\mu_w^0(P+\\Pi) - \\mu_w^0(P) = -RT \\ln(x_w)\n$$\nThe change in chemical potential of a pure substance with pressure at constant temperature is given by the fundamental relation $d\\mu_w^0 = V_{m,w} dP$, where $V_{m,w}$ is the partial molar volume of water. Integrating this expression from pressure $P$ to $P+\\Pi$ yields the left-hand side of our equation:\n$$\n\\int_{P}^{P+\\Pi} d\\mu_w^0 = \\int_{P}^{P+\\Pi} V_{m,w} dP'\n$$\nAssuming the solvent (water) is incompressible over the pressure range of $\\Pi$, its partial molar volume $V_{m,w}$ can be treated as a constant. The integral simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mu_w^0(P+\\Pi) - \\mu_w^0(P) = V_{m,w} \\int_{P}^{P+\\Pi} dP' = V_{m,w} \\Pi\n$$\nBy equating the two results, we obtain a general expression for osmotic pressure in an ideal solution:\n$$\n\\Pi V_{m,w} = -RT \\ln(x_w)\n$$\nThe mole fraction of the solvent, $x_w$, is related to the mole fraction of the solute, $x_s$, by $x_w = 1 - x_s$. For a dilute solution where $x_s \\ll 1$, we can use the Taylor series expansion for the natural logarithm: $\\ln(1 - x_s) \\approx -x_s$. Substituting this into the equation yields:\n$$\n\\Pi V_{m,w} \\approx -RT(-x_s) = RTx_s\n$$\nThe mole fraction of the solute is $x_s = \\frac{n_s}{n_s + n_w}$, where $n_s$ and $n_w$ are the number of moles of solute and solvent, respectively. For a dilute solution, $n_s \\ll n_w$, so $x_s \\approx \\frac{n_s}{n_w}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\Pi V_{m,w} \\approx RT \\frac{n_s}{n_w}\n$$\nThe total volume of the solution, $V$, is approximately the volume of the solvent, $V \\approx n_w V_{m,w}$. Substituting $n_w \\approx \\frac{V}{V_{m,w}}$ gives:\n$$\n\\Pi V_{m,w} \\approx RT \\frac{n_s}{V/V_{m,w}} = RT \\frac{n_s V_{m,w}}{V}\n$$\nDividing by $V_{m,w}$ yields the van 't Hoff equation, which is the requested ideal-solution expression in terms of solute concentration $C_s = \\frac{n_s}{V}$:\n$$\n\\Pi_{ideal} = RTC_s\n$$\nFor a non-electrolyte, the van 't Hoff factor $i=1$ is implicit in this derivation.\n\nNumerical Calculation:\nThe problem states that for a non-ideal solution, the corrected osmotic pressure, $\\Pi_{corr}$, is given by introducing the osmotic coefficient, $\\phi$:\n$$\n\\Pi_{corr} = \\phi \\Pi_{ideal} = \\phi RTC_s\n$$\nWe are given the following values:\n$\\phi = 0.92$\n$R = 8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n$T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$C_s = 1.20\\,\\mathrm{M} = 1.20\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$\n\nTo ensure SI unit consistency, we must convert the concentration from $\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$ to $\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}}$.
