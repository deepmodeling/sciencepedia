It is a formalizable and relevant problem.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis begins with the provided partial differential equation for the morphogen concentration $C(x,t)$:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} C(x,t) = D\\,\\partial_{xx} C(x,t) - k\\,C(x,t) + J\\,\\delta(x)\n$$\nIn the steady state, the concentration profile no longer changes with time, which means $\\partial_{t} C(x,t) = 0$. The concentration becomes a function of position only, $C(x)$. The governing equation simplifies to a second-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\nD\\,\\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} - k\\,C(x) + J\\,\\delta(x) = 0\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged as:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} - \\frac{k}{D}\\,C(x) = -\\frac{J}{D}\\,\\delta(x)\n$$\nWe examine the dimensions of the coefficients. The diffusion coefficient $D$ has units of $[L]^2[T]^{-1}$, and the degradation rate constant $k$ has units of $[T]^{-1}$. Therefore, the term $k/D$ has units of $([T]^{-1})/([L]^2[T]^{-1}) = [L]^{-2}$. It is thus natural to define a quantity with the dimension of length, the characteristic length $\\lambda$, such that $\\lambda^{-2} = k/D$. This gives the definition from first principles, as requested:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}}\n$$\nSubstituting this definition, the steady-state equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}\\,C(x) = -\\frac{J}{D}\\,\\delta(x)\n$$\nWe must solve this equation. For any region where $x \\neq 0$, the Dirac delta term $\\delta(x)$ is zero. The equation simplifies to a homogeneous linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}\\,C(x) = 0 \\quad (\\text{for } x \\neq 0)\n$$\nThe characteristic equation for this ODE is $r^2 - \\lambda^{-2} = 0$, which has roots $r = \\pm 1/\\lambda$. The general solution is therefore a linear combination of exponential functions:\n$$\nC(x) = A\\,\\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) + B\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\nThis general form must satisfy the boundary condition that $C(x) \\to 0$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$. We must consider the regions $x>0$ and $x<0$ separately.\n\nFor $x > 0$: As $x \\to \\infty$, the term $\\exp(x/\\lambda)$ diverges. For the concentration to vanish, its coefficient must be zero. Thus, for $x > 0$, the solution must have the form $C(x) = B_1\\,\\exp(-x/\\lambda)$.\n\nFor $x < 0$: As $x \\to -\\infty$, the term $\\exp(-x/\\lambda)$ diverges. For the concentration to vanish, its coefficient must be zero. Thus, for $x < 0$, the solution must have the form $C(x) = A_2\\,\\exp(x/\\lambda)$.\n\nWe can combine these two forms using the absolute value function, which is valid due to the symmetry of the problem around $x=0$.\n$$\nC(x) = A\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\nThis form satisfies the boundary conditions at $\\pm\\infty$ and also imposes the physical requirement of continuity at the origin, $C(0^+) = C(0^-) = A$.\n\nTo determine the constant $A$, we must account for the source term $J\\,\\delta(x)$. We integrate the full steady-state equation across an infinitesimal interval $[-\\epsilon, \\epsilon]$ around the origin:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\left( D\\,\\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} - k\\,C(x) + J\\,\\delta(x) \\right) dx = 0\n$$\n$$\nD \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\frac{d^2C}{dx^2}\\,dx - k \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} C(x)\\,dx + J \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\delta(x)\\,dx = 0\n$$\nEvaluating each integral in the limit $\\epsilon \\to 0$:\n1. $D \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\frac{d^2C}{dx^2}\\,dx = D \\left[ \\frac{dC}{dx} \\right]_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} = D \\left( \\left.\\frac{dC}{dx}\\right|_{x=\\epsilon} - \\left.\\frac{dC}{dx}\\right|_{x=-\\epsilon} \\right)$. This term represents the discontinuity in the diffusive flux across the source.\n2. $k \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} C(x)\\,dx \\to 0$ because $C(x)$ is continuous and bounded at $x=0$, so the integral over an interval of vanishing width is zero.\n3. $J \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\delta(x)\\,dx = J$, by definition of the Dirac delta distribution.\n\nThus, the integrated equation yields the jump condition for the derivative at the origin:\n$$\nD \\left( \\left.\\frac{dC}{dx}\\right|_{x=0^+} - \\left.\\frac{dC}{dx}\\right|_{x=0^-} \\right) + J = 0\n$$\nNow we compute the derivatives from our solution $C(x) = A\\,\\exp(-|x|/\\lambda)$:\n- For $x > 0$, $C(x) = A\\,\\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, so $\\frac{dC}{dx} = -\\frac{A}{\\lambda}\\,\\exp(-x/\\lambda)$. At $x=0^+$, $\\left.\\frac{dC}{dx}\\right|_{x=0^+} = -A/\\lambda$.\n- For $x < 0$, $C(x) = A\\,\\exp(x/\\lambda)$, so $\\frac{dC}{dx} = \\frac{A}{\\lambda}\\,\\exp(x/\\lambda)$. At $x=0^-$, $\\left.\\frac{dC}{dx}\\right|_{x=0^-} = A/\\lambda$.\n\nSubstituting these into the jump condition:\n$$\nD \\left( \\left(-\\frac{A}{\\lambda}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{A}{\\lambda}\\right) \\right) + J = 0\n$$\n$$\nD \\left( -\\frac{2A}{\\lambda} \\right) = -J\n$$\n$$\nA = \\frac{J\\lambda}{2D}\n$$\nNow we substitute this expression for $A$ back into the solution for $C(x)$:\n$$\nC(x) = \\frac{J\\lambda}{2D}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, we must express the answer only in terms of the given parameters $J$, $D$, $k$, and $x$. We substitute $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$:\n$$\nC(x) = \\frac{J}{2D} \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|}{\\sqrt{D/k}}\\right)\n$$\nThe pre-factor simplifies: $\\frac{J}{2D} \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}} = \\frac{J}{2\\sqrt{D^2}} \\frac{\\sqrt{D}}{\\sqrt{k}} = \\frac{J\\sqrt{D}}{2\\sqrt{D^2}\\sqrt{k}} = \\frac{J}{2\\sqrt{Dk}}$. The term in the exponent is $-|x|\\sqrt{k/D}$.\nThis gives the final steady-state concentration profile:\n$$\nC(x) = \\frac{J}{2\\sqrt{Dk}} \\exp\\left(-|x|\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)\n$$\n**Biological Interpretation of the Characteristic Length $\\lambda$:**\nThe characteristic length $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$ is the fundamental length scale of the morphogen gradient. It emerges naturally from the competition between two processes: diffusion ($D$), which spreads the morphogen, and degradation ($k$), which removes it.\nThe derived concentration profile $C(x) \\propto \\exp(-|x|/\\lambda)$ shows that $\\lambda$ is the e-folding distance of the exponential decay. At a distance $x=\\lambda$ from the source, the morphogen concentration has decayed to $1/e$ (approximately $37\\%$) of its maximum value at the source.\nIn the context of axis specification, different cell fates are often determined by threshold concentrations of a morphogen. The value of $\\lambda$ determines the spatial extent over which the morphogen can provide positional information.\n- A large $\\lambda$ (high diffusion or low degradation) results in a shallow, long-range gradient, enabling the source to specify cell fates over a large portion of the embryonic axis.\n- A small $\\lambda$ (low diffusion or high degradation) results in a steep, short-range gradient, restricting positional information to a region very near the source.\nThus, $\\lambda$ directly controls the scale of the pattern established along the body axis.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{J}{2\\sqrt{Dk}}\\exp\\left(-|x|\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2636031"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical models are most powerful when they connect with experimental reality, which involves finite tissues and strict developmental timelines.

The problem is a standard exercise in mathematical biology, is scientifically grounded in the context of developmental biology, and is well-posed. No inconsistencies, ambiguities, or factual errors are present. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be derived.\n\nFirst, we determine the steady-state concentration profile, denoted $c_s(x)$. The steady state is defined by the condition $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = 0$.

The calibration step ensures a unique basis for comparison. The objective is clearly defined and quantifiable.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is precise and technical, devoid of subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It presents a standard theoretical exercise in quantitative developmental biology. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first determining the state of the system at the baseline length $L_0$, then applying the specified perturbation and calculating the resulting change for each model.\n\nFirst, we analyze the system at its baseline length $L_0 = 600\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ for the diffusion-decay model. A boundary is formed at the position $x_0^*$ where the morphogen concentration $M(x)$ equals the threshold $T$.\n$$M(x_0^*) = T$$\nUsing the given profile for the diffusion-decay model, we have:\n$$M_0 \\exp(-x_0^*/\\lambda) = T$$\nThis can be rearranged to solve for $x_0^*$:\n$$\\exp(x_0^*/\\lambda) = \\frac{M_0}{T}$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides yields:\n$$\\frac{x_0^*}{\\lambda} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{M_0}{T}\\right)$$\n$$x_0^* = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{M_0}{T}\\right)$$\nWe are given $\\lambda = 60\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ and $M_0/T = \\exp(2)$. Substituting these values:\n$$x_0^* = (60\\,\\mu\\text{m}) \\ln(\\exp(2)) = (60\\,\\mu\\text{m}) \\times 2 = 120\\,\\mu\\text{m}$$\nThis is the absolute position of the boundary at baseline. The fractional boundary position, $p_0$, is this position divided by the total length $L_0$:\n$$p_0 = \\frac{x_0^*}{L_0} = \\frac{120\\,\\mu\\text{m}}{600\\,\\mu\\text{m}} = \\frac{120}{600} = \\frac{1}{5}$$\nThe problem states that the shuttling model is calibrated to reproduce this same threshold position at baseline. The defining characteristic of the shuttling model is its scale invariance, meaning its fractional boundary position, which we denote $p_{\\text{shuttle}}$, remains constant regardless of the total length $L$. Therefore, we have:\n$$p_{\\text{shuttle}} = p_0 = \\frac{1}{5}$$\nNext, we consider the perturbation. The embryo's length increases by $50\\%$. The new length, $L_1$, is:\n$$L_1 = L_0 \\times (1 + 0.5) = L_0 \\times 1.5 = 600\\,\\mu\\text{m} \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 900\\,\\mu\\text{m}$$\nThe parameters $D$, $k$, $M_0$, and $T$ are specified to be constant. This implies that the characteristic length $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$ also remains unchanged.\n\nNow we calculate the new fractional boundary positions for both models under the new length $L_1$.\n\nFor the diffusion-decay model, the absolute position of the boundary, $x_{1, \\text{diff}}^*$, is still determined by the equation $x^* = \\lambda \\ln(M_0/T)$. Since $\\lambda$, $M_0$, and $T$ have not changed, the absolute position of the boundary is robust to the change in system size:\n$$x_{1, \\text{diff}}^* = x_0^* = 120\\,\\mu\\text{m}$$\nHowever, the fractional position, $p_{1, \\text{diff}}$, does change because the total length $L_1$ is different:\n$$p_{1, \\text{diff}} = \\frac{x_{1, \\text{diff}}^*}{L_1} = \\frac{120\\,\\mu\\text{m}}{900\\,\\mu\\text{m}} = \\frac{120}{900} = \\frac{12}{90} = \\frac{2}{15}$$\nFor the shuttling model, its scale-invariant nature means the fractional boundary position is constant by definition. It remains at its calibrated value:\n$$p_{1, \\text{shuttle}} = p_{\\text{shuttle}} = \\frac{1}{5}$$\nFinally, we compute the difference $\\Delta$ between the fractional boundary positions predicted by the two models after the perturbation:\n$$\\Delta = p_{1, \\text{shuttle}} - p_{1, \\text{diff}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\\Delta = \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{2}{15}$$\nTo perform the subtraction, we use a common denominator of $15$:\n$$\\Delta = \\frac{3}{15} - \\frac{2}{15} = \\frac{1}{15}$$\nThis result quantifies the discrepancy in scaling behavior between a simple diffusion-decay mechanism, which provides absolute positional information, and a scale-invariant mechanism, which provides relative positional information.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{15}}$$", "id": "2636036"}]}
