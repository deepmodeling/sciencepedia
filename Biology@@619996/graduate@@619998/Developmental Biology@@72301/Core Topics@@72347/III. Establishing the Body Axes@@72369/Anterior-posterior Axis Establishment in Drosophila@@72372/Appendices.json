It is scientifically grounded, describing a standard reaction-diffusion model for morphogen gradient formation, which is a cornerstone of quantitative developmental biology. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information and consistent data to derive the characteristic length and compute the required ratio. No logical contradictions or factual errors are present. We will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe concentration of the Bicoid protein, $c(x,t)$, is described by the one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^{2} c}{\\partial x^{2}} - k c + s(x) $$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $k$ is the first-order degradation rate constant, and $s(x)$ is the source term.\n\nThe problem asks for the characteristic decay length of the steady-state solution. At steady state, the concentration profile no longer changes with time, which implies $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = 0$. The governing partial differential equation thus simplifies to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the steady-state concentration profile, $c_{ss}(x)$:\n$$ 0 = D \\frac{d^{2} c_{ss}}{d x^{2}} - k c_{ss} + s(x) $$\nThe problem further specifies that we should consider the solution in the bulk of the embryo, away from the localized source at $x=0$. In this region ($x > 0$), the source term $s(x)$ is zero. The equation governing the steady-state profile in the bulk is therefore:\n$$ D \\frac{d^{2} c_{ss}}{d x^{2}} - k c_{ss} = 0 $$\nThis can be rearranged into a standard form for a second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients:\n$$ \\frac{d^{2} c_{ss}}{d x^{2}} - \\frac{k}{D} c_{ss} = 0 $$\nThe characteristic equation for this ODE is $m^2 - \\frac{k}{D} = 0$, which has the roots $m = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}$.\nThe general solution is then of the form:\n$$ c_{ss}(x) = A \\exp\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} x\\right) + B \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} x\\right) $$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants determined by boundary conditions.

The term $A \\exp\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} x\\right)$ diverges as $x \\to \\infty$.

The problem states that the gradient decays with a characteristic e-fold decay length $\\lambda$, meaning the functional form is $c_{ss}(x) \\propto \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$. By comparing this form with our derived solution, we can identify the characteristic decay length $\\lambda$ as:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\lambda} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} $$\nSolving for $\\lambda$ yields the theoretical decay length in terms of the diffusion coefficient and the degradation rate:\n$$ \\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}} $$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we must calculate the ratio $r = \\lambda / L_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ using the provided numerical values.\nFirst, we determine the degradation rate $k$ from the half-life $T_{1/2}$. The half-life for a first-order decay process is related to the rate constant by $k = (\\ln 2)/T_{1/2}$.\nThe given half-life is $T_{1/2} = 50~\\mathrm{min}$.
