Monotonicity and continuity: For a fixed total $T=L+R>0$, $S$ is a continuous and strictly increasing function of the difference $D=R-L$.\n\nFrom constraint $3$, the index $S(L,R)$ must be a homogeneous function of degree $0$. This implies that $S$ depends only on the relative proportion of $L$ and $R$. We can therefore express $S$ as a function of a single scale-invariant variable. A robust choice for such a variable, which is well-defined for all $L, R$ not both zero, is $x = \\frac{R-L}{R+L}$. We can thus posit the functional form $S(L,R) = H(x) = H\\left(\\frac{R-L}{R+L}\\right)$ for some function $H$. The domain of the variable $x$ is $[-1, 1]$.\n\nWe now map the remaining constraints onto properties of the function $H(x)$:\n-   From constraint $1$, $H\\left(\\frac{R-L}{R+L}\\right) = -S(R,L) = -H\\left(\\frac{L-R}{L+R}\\right) = -H\\left(-\\frac{R-L}{R+L}\\right)$. This shows that $H(x) = -H(-x)$, meaning $H(x)$ must be an odd function. This correctly yields $S(L,L) = H(0) = 0$.\n-   From constraint $2$, $S(0,R)=1$ for $R>0$, which corresponds to $x = \\frac{R-0}{R+0} = 1$. Thus, we must have $H(1)=1$. The condition $S(L,0)=-1$ for $L>0$ corresponds to $x = \\frac{0-L}{0+L} = -1$, requiring $H(-1)=-1$. This second condition is redundant, as it follows from $H(x)$ being an odd function and $H(1)=1$.\n-   From constraint $4$, for a fixed total $T = L+R$, $S$ is a continuous and strictly increasing function of the difference $D = R-L$. Since $S = H(D/T)$ and $T>0$ is a fixed positive constant, the function $H(x)$ must be continuous and strictly increasing over its domain $x \\in [-1, 1]$.\n\nWe seek a function $H(x)$ that is continuous, strictly increasing, and odd on $[-1, 1]$, with the normalization $H(1)=1$. While more complex functions could satisfy these constraints, the principle of parsimony demands the simplest possible form, which is a linear relationship. The simplest odd function is $H(x) = c x$. Applying the normalization condition $H(1)=1$, we find $c=1$. Therefore, the function must be $H(x)=x$. All constraints are satisfied by this choice without introducing any arbitrary complexity.
