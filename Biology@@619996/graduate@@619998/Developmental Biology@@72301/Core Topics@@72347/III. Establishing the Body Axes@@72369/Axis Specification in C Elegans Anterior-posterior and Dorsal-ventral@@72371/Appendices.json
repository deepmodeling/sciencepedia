This exercise explores the fundamental competition between directed transport via cortical flow (advection) and random molecular motion (diffusion). By deriving and calculating a key dimensionless parameter, the Péclet number, you will gain a quantitative appreciation for why the advection-driven mechanism is so robust for segregating PAR proteins in the relatively large *C. elegans* zygote [@problem_id:2621443]. This provides the physical foundation upon which the entire system of polarity is built.", "problem": "In the one-cell embryo of the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans*, the establishment of the anterior–posterior axis depends on segregation of Partitioning defective (PAR) proteins on the cortex driven by cortical flow and counteracted by diffusion. Consider a one-dimensional cortical coordinate along the long axis with surface concentration field $c(x,t)$ transported by a uniform cortical flow of speed $v$ over a characteristic half-length $L$, and undergoing lateral diffusion with coefficient $D$. Starting from the standard advection–diffusion equation for a conserved scalar on a line, and using dimensional analysis or nondimensionalization with characteristic scales $x \\sim L$ and $t$ chosen to reflect advective transport across the half-length, derive the single dimensionless control parameter that compares advective to diffusive transport for this system.

Do not round unless necessary.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the dimensionless parameter governing the competition between advection and diffusion in the establishment of PAR protein polarity in the *C. elegans* embryo, and for the calculation of its numerical value.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing physical equation. The evolution of the surface concentration field of PAR proteins, $c(x,t)$, along a one-dimensional cortical coordinate $x$ is described by the advection-diffusion equation. For a conserved scalar quantity, the continuity equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nwhere $J$ is the total flux of the protein. The flux consists of two components: an advective flux due to the cortical flow, $J_{\\text{adv}} = vc$, and a diffusive flux due to random thermal motion, $J_{\\text{diff}} = -D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$, as given by Fick's first law. The speed of the uniform cortical flow is $v$ and the diffusion coefficient is $D$.\n\nThe total flux is $J = vc - D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$. Substituting this into the continuity equation, we obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( vc - D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} \\right) = 0\n$$\nAssuming the flow speed $v$ and diffusion coefficient $D$ are constant in space, the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + v \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThis is the fundamental advection-diffusion equation for the system.\n\nTo identify the dimensionless control parameter, we nondimensionalize this equation. We introduce dimensionless variables for space, time, and concentration. Let $c_0$ be a characteristic concentration. Following the problem statement, we define the dimensionless spatial coordinate $\\tilde{x}$ using the characteristic half-length $L$:\n$$\n\\tilde{x} = \\frac{x}{L}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the characteristic time scale, $\\tau$, should reflect advective transport across the half-length $L$. This time scale is naturally $\\tau = \\frac{L}{v}$. We define the dimensionless time $\\tilde{t}$ as:\n$$\n\\tilde{t} = \\frac{t}{\\tau} = \\frac{t}{L/v} = \\frac{vt}{L}\n$$\nLet us also define a dimensionless concentration $\\tilde{c}$:\n$$\n\\tilde{c} = \\frac{c}{c_0}\n$$\nNow, we transform the derivatives using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{t}}{\\partial t} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} = \\frac{v}{L} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tilde{t}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{x}}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tilde{x}} = \\frac{1}{L} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tilde{x}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{1}{L} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tilde{x}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{L^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\tilde{x}^2}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the advection-diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{v}{L} \\frac{\\partial (c_0 \\tilde{c})}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} + v \\frac{1}{L} \\frac{\\partial (c_0 \\tilde{c})}{\\partial \\tilde{x}} = D \\frac{1}{L^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 (c_0 \\tilde{c})}{\\partial \\tilde{x}^2}\n$$\nSince $c_0$ is a constant, it can be factored out:\n$$\nc_0 \\frac{v}{L} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} + c_0 \\frac{v}{L} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\tilde{x}} = c_0 \\frac{D}{L^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\tilde{x}^2}\n$$\nWe can divide the entire equation by the factor $c_0 \\frac{v}{L}$ to make it dimensionless:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} + \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\tilde{x}} = \\left(\\frac{D}{L^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{L}{v}\\right) \\frac{\\partial^2 \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\tilde{x}^2}\n$$\nSimplifying the coefficient of the second derivative term gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} + \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\tilde{x}} = \\left(\\frac{D}{vL}\\right) \\frac{\\partial^2 \\tilde{c}}{\\partial \\tilde{x}^2}\n$$\nIn this dimensionless form, the coefficients of the terms are pure numbers. The parameter comparing advective to diffusive transport is the ratio of their respective term strengths. In our chosen scaling, the strength of the advective transport term is normalized to $1$. The strength of the diffusive transport is given by the coefficient $\\frac{D}{vL}$. The single dimensionless parameter that compares advection to diffusion is the inverse of this coefficient, known as the Péclet number, $Pe$:\n$$\nPe = \\frac{vL}{D}\n$$\nThis parameter represents the ratio of the rate of advective transport to the rate of diffusive transport. A large $Pe$ indicates that advection dominates, while a small $Pe$ indicates that diffusion dominates. This can also be seen by comparing the characteristic time scales for diffusion over length $L$, $t_{\\text{diff}} = \\frac{L^2}{D}$, and for advection over the same length, $t_{\\text{adv}} = \\frac{L}{v}$. Their ratio is $Pe = \\frac{t_{\\text{diff}}}{t_{\\text{adv}}}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of the Péclet number using the provided data:\n- Cortical flow speed: $v = 0.3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m/s}$\n- Characteristic half-length: $L = 25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n- PAR protein cortical diffusion coefficient: $D = 0.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the Péclet number:\n$$\nPe = \\frac{(0.3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m/s}) \\times (25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m})}{0.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}}\n$$\nThe units cancel out as expected: $\\frac{(\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}) \\cdot \\mu\\mathrm{m}}{\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}}{\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}} = 1$.\nThe numerical value is:\n$$\nPe = \\frac{0.3 \\times 25}{0.1} = \\frac{7.5}{0.1} = 75\n$$\nThe Péclet number for this system is $75$.

The cleavage plane forms near the spindle midzone, so asymmetric cortical pulling forces that displace the spindle posteriorly produce an unequal $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$ cleavage that yields a larger anterior AB blastomere and a smaller posterior P1 blastomere.

It accurately describes the core, established model of anterior-posterior axis specification in *C. elegans*. The roles of the sperm cue, $\\text{PAR}$ proteins, and their connection to asymmetric division are fundamental concepts in developmental biology. The question poses a standard thought experiment by postulating a loss-of-function mutation in a key component, *par-3*, and asks for a prediction based on a specified set of principles. The problem is self-contained, and its premises are not contradictory.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe problem requires predicting the outcome of a *par-3* loss-of-function mutation based on the provided principles.\n\n1.  **Role of the Anterior $\\text{PAR}$ Complex:** The anterior domain consists of a complex of $\\text{PAR-3}$, $\\text{PAR-6}$, and $\\text{PKC-3}$. In this complex, $\\text{PAR-3}$ acts as a crucial scaffold protein. It is required to recruit and stably anchor $\\text{PAR-6}$ and $\\text{PKC-3}$ to the cell cortex. A loss-of-function mutation in *par-3* means this scaffold is absent. Consequently, a stable anterior $\\text{PAR}$ complex cannot form or be maintained at the cortex.\n\n2.  **Effect on Mutual Antagonism:** The system is defined by mutual antagonism between the anterior and posterior $\\text{PAR}$ domains. The anterior complex is responsible for excluding the posterior complex from the anterior cortex. With the functional elimination of the anterior complex due to the *par-3* mutation, this antagonism is lost. The posterior complex no longer faces opposition.\n\n3.  **Fate of the Posterior $\\text{PAR}$ Complex:** The problem states that sperm entry and the centrosome trigger the \"posterior seeding\" of posterior $\\text{PAR}$s ($\\text{PAR-2}$ and $\\text{PAR-1}$). This initial localization cue is intact. Therefore, $\\text{PAR-2}$ and $\\text{PAR-1}$ will still accumulate at the posterior pole initially. However, in the absence of an antagonistic anterior domain to contain them, these posterior proteins will spread from their initial location. The actomyosin flows, also intact, will no longer segregate two opposing complexes but will instead contribute to the distribution of the only stable complex remaining—the posterior one. The expected steady state is one where the posterior $\\text{PAR}$ module ($\\text{PAR-2}$/$\\text{PAR-1}$) expands to cover the entire cortex.\n\n4.  **Consequences for Spindle Positioning and Cleavage:** In the wild type, asymmetric spindle pulling forces are a direct result of the different properties of the anterior and posterior cortical domains. The posterior domain generates higher pulling forces. If the posterior domain expands to cover the entire cortex, the cortex becomes uniform in its force-generating properties. The pulling forces exerted on the astral microtubules of the mitotic spindle will become symmetric, or balanced. There will be no net posterior-directed force. As a result, the spindle will fail to displace towards the posterior and will remain positioned in the center of the cell.\n\n5.  **Final Outcome:** The problem states that the cleavage plane forms near the spindle midzone. A centered spindle will, therefore, be bisected by a cleavage plane at the cell's geometric center. This will result in a symmetric first cleavage, producing two daughter blastomeres of equal size.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The posterior PAR-2/PAR-1 module expands broadly over the cortex because the anterior antagonism cannot be established; PAR-6/PKC-3 fail to form a stable anterior cortical cap. Cortical pulling forces are effectively balanced, the spindle remains centered, and the $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$ cleavage is symmetric, producing $2$ equal-sized blastomeres.**\nThis option presents a sequence of events that is entirely consistent with the derivation above. The loss of the anterior scaffold ($\\text{PAR-3}$) leads to the failure of the anterior complex, which allows the unopposed posterior complex to expand, which in turn symmetrizes cortical pulling forces, centers the spindle, and causes a symmetric cleavage.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The anterior PAR-6/PKC-3 complex coats the entire cortex due to loss of posterior competition; PAR-2/PAR-1 are excluded to a small posterior patch. The spindle remains centered and the $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$ cleavage is symmetric, yielding $2$ equal-sized blastomeres.**\nThis option's premise is flawed. The mutation affects *par-3*, the scaffold for the anterior complex. Without $\\text{PAR-3}$, the anterior complex ($\\text{PAR-6}$/$\\text{PKC-3}$) cannot be cortically localized, let alone expand. Therefore, this description of the $\\text{PAR}$ distribution is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Redundant mechanisms recruit PAR-6/PKC-3 to an anterior cortical domain and restrict PAR-2/PAR-1 to the posterior, restoring a wild-type-like PAR pattern. Posterior spindle displacement is preserved and the $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$ cleavage is asymmetric, yielding a larger AB and smaller P1.**\nThis option invokes redundancy, which is not among the \"core principles\" provided for solving the problem. The question requires a prediction based on the given rules, under which the loss of a key scaffold protein should have a definitive consequence. This option incorrectly predicts a wild-type phenotype.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Polarity is reversed: PAR-2/PAR-1 localize to the anterior, PAR-6/PKC-3 to the posterior, and spindle displacement is inverted, yielding a smaller AB and larger P1 at the $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$ cleavage.**\nThis option is incorrect. The initial cue for polarity, sperm entry at the posterior, remains intact and seeds the posterior $\\text{PAR}$s at the posterior. There is no mechanism described that would cause a reversal of this fundamental process. Furthermore, the anterior complex cannot form a stable domain anywhere without $\\text{PAR-3}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Polarity becomes spatially fragmented: PAR-2/PAR-1 and PAR-6/PKC-3 form multiple alternating cortical patches, producing erratic, hyper-asymmetric spindle positioning and highly unequal daughter sizes at the $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$ cleavage.**\nThis option is less likely than a uniform state. Given a system with one remaining stable component (the posterior complex) and global cortical flows, the most logical outcome is the homogenization of the cortex as this component spreads, not the spontaneous de-novo formation of multiple, alternating domains. This would lead to a symmetric state, not a chaotic or hyper-asymmetric one.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2621491"}, {"introduction": "Establishing cortical polarity is not an end in itself; it is the critical first step in a cascade that determines the developmental fate of daughter cells.

The described molecular interactions are a cornerstone of the field.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is valid. Proceeding to solution derivation.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct State\nThe solution is derived by following the causal chain of events, starting from the genetic perturbation.\n\n1.  **Initial Perturbation**: The defined experiment is a maternal loss-of-function of *par-1*. This means the PAR-$\\!1$ protein, a kinase normally localized to the posterior cortex, is absent from the zygote.\n\n2.  **Effect on PAR Protein Asymmetry**: The problem states that the anterior PAR complex (PAR-$\\!3$/PAR-$\\!6$/PKC-$\\!3$) and the posterior PAR complex (PAR-$\\!1$/PAR-$\\!2$) are in reciprocal cortical domains. This implies mutual antagonism. Without PAR-$\\!1$ to define the posterior domain and restrict the anterior proteins, the anterior PAR complex (PAR-$\\!3$/PAR-$\\!6$/PKC-$\\!3$) expands its domain to occupy the entire zygote cortex. The posterior cortical identity is lost.\n\n3.  **Effect on MEX-$\\!5$ Gradient**: The problem states that \"Posterior PAR-$\\!1$ kinase spatially regulates... MEX-$\\!5$\" and \"generates an anterior-high, posterior-low gradient of MEX-$\\!5$ by spatially biased phosphorylation\". This means the activity of PAR-$\\!1$ in the posterior is responsible for creating the \"low\" pole of the MEX-$\\!5$ gradient. In the absence of PAR-$\\!1$, this posterior-specific regulation is eliminated. The mechanism that generates the gradient is therefore non-functional. Consequently, MEX-$\\!5$ will not be segregated into a gradient. It will adopt its default state uniformly throughout the cytoplasm. Since the normal state is an *anterior-high* gradient, the default, unregulated state in the cytoplasm corresponds to the \"high\" activity state seen in the wild-type anterior. Therefore, in a *par-1* mutant, MEX-$\\!5$ will be uniformly distributed and its activity will be uniformly high.\n\n4.  **Effect on PIE-$\\!1$ Segregation**: The problem states that \"high MEX-$\\!5$ activity promotes selective elimination of germline factors in the anterior\". A primary target of this elimination is PIE-$\\!1$. In a wild-type embryo, high MEX-$\\!5$ in the anterior degrades PIE-$\\!1$ there, while low MEX-$\\!5$ in the posterior allows PIE-$\\!1$ to accumulate. In the *par-1* mutant embryo, MEX-$\\!5$ activity is uniformly high across the entire cell. This will lead to the elimination of PIE-$\\!1$ protein from the entire embryo, including both the anterior and posterior regions. As a result, PIE-$\\!1$ fails to become enriched in the posterior.\n\n5.  **Consequence for Germline Specification**: The final premise is that \"PIE-$\\!1$ must be enriched in the posterior blastomere at the first cleavage to protect germline fate\". Since PIE-$\\!1$ is eliminated from the entire embryo in a *par-1* mutant, it cannot be present in the posterior blastomere to perform its function. The protection of germline fate fails, and consequently, the germline is not specified. The resulting posterior blastomere adopts a somatic fate, typically that of its anterior sister cell.\n\nThis logical cascade leads to a single, predictable outcome. We now evaluate the options against this derived result.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The MEX-$\\!5$ anterior-high gradient fails to form and MEX-$\\!5$ remains uniformly high; PIE-$\\!1$ is not posteriorly enriched and is eliminated from both blastomeres; the germline is not specified.**\nThis statement precisely matches the derived consequences. The loss of *par-1* abolishes the MEX-$\\!5$ gradient, leading to uniformly high MEX-$\\!5$. This, in turn, causes the degradation of PIE-$\\!1$ throughout the embryo, preventing its posterior enrichment. The absence of PIE-$\\!1$ in the posterior founder cell results in a failure to specify the germline.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The MEX-$\\!5$ anterior-high gradient steepens because anterior PARs expand; PIE-$\\!1$ becomes even more restricted to the posterior; germline specification proceeds normally.**\nThis is incorrect. While the anterior PAR domain does expand, this event is causally linked to the loss of the posterior domain and its functions. The function of the posterior domain is to create the low pole of the MEX-$\\!5$ gradient. Loss of this function abolishes the gradient; it does not steepen it. The downstream consequences are therefore also incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The MEX-$\\!5$ gradient reverses to posterior-high; PIE-$\\!1$ segregates to the anterior blastomere; an ectopic germline arises in the anterior lineage.**\nThis is incorrect. A loss-of-function of a posterior component (*par-1*) leads to a uniform anterior character, not a reversal of polarity. A polarity reversal would require a gain-of-function or mislocalization of polarity determinants, which is not the experiment described.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Dorsal-ventral patterning is primarily affected, leaving anterior-posterior MEX-$\\!5$ and PIE-$\\!1$ distributions intact; the germline is specified normally but with dorsal-ventral inversion.**\nThis is incorrect. The problem explicitly defines PAR-$\\!1$ as a key regulator of *anterior-posterior* polarity. While cross-talk between axes exists, the primary and direct consequence of *par-1* loss is on a-p patterning. Stating that A-P distributions remain intact is a direct contradiction of the given principles.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. MEX-$\\!5$ activity becomes uniformly low because its phosphorylation is lost; PIE-$\\!1$ persists uniformly; both blastomeres adopt germline fate leading to duplicated germline.**\nThis is incorrect. This option misinterprets the regulatory logic. The premise is that PAR-$\\!1$ acts in the posterior to generate an *anterior-high, posterior-low* MEX-$\\!5$ gradient. This implies that the action of PAR-$\\!1$ (phosphorylation) in the posterior *reduces* MEX-$\\!5$ activity or promotes its clearance from that region. Therefore, the loss of PAR-$\\!1$ and its phosphorylation activity leads to uniformly *high* MEX-$\\!5$ activity, not low. The phenotype described (uniform PIE-$\\!1$, duplicated germline) is characteristic of a *mex-5* loss-of-function, not a *par-1* loss-of-function.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2621524"}]}
