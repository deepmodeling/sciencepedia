The parameters provided are physically realistic for protein diffusion in an extracellular context. The problem is objective and free of ambiguity or contradiction. It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe first step is to derive the expression for the characteristic length $\\ell$. We begin with the provided PDE:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial t} \\;=\\; D_{s}\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} s}{\\partial x^{2}} \\;-\\; \\lambda_{s}\\,s\n$$\nAt steady state, the concentration profile no longer changes with time, which implies that the time derivative is zero: $\\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial t} = 0$. The PDE thus simplifies to a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n0 \\;=\\; D_{s}\\,\\frac{d^{2} s}{d x^{2}} \\;-\\; \\lambda_{s}\\,s\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged into a more standard form:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2} s}{d x^{2}} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\lambda_{s}}{D_{s}}\\,s\n$$\nThis is a linear, homogeneous, second-order ODE with constant coefficients.

The problem considers the solution for $x \\ge 0$, representing the distance from the ventral midline. For the concentration to be physically realistic, it must not increase without bound as $x \\to \\infty$.

A broad gradient would imply a decay length that is a significant fraction of the system size. Since $\\ell$ is much smaller than the circumference, the gradient is sharp and highly localized around the ventral midline. The ligand is effectively removed by degradation or clearance long before it can diffuse far from its source.

Let the dissociation constant be $K_{d}$, defined by mass-action equilibrium as $K_{d} = [D][C]/[X]$. Let the cytoplasmic totals be $D_{T} = [D] + [X]$ and $C_{T} = [C] + [X]$.

First, we establish the general relationship for protein binding at equilibrium. Second, we incorporate the steady-state kinetics of synthesis and degradation to find the specific concentration of free Dorsal as a function of the Toll signal.\n\nThe system is described by the following relationships:\n1.  Conservation of total Dorsal: $D_{T} = [D] + [X]$, where $[D]$ is the concentration of free Dorsal and $[X]$ is the concentration of the Dorsal-Cactus complex.\n2.  Conservation of total Cactus: $C_{T} = [C] + [X]$, where $[C]$ is the concentration of free Cactus.\n3.  Mass-action binding equilibrium: $K_{d} = \\frac{[D][C]}{[X]}$, where $K_{d}$ is the dissociation constant.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the bound fraction of Dorsal, $f_{b}$**\n\nThe first task is to derive an expression for the fraction of bound Dorsal, $f_{b} = [X]/D_{T}$, as a function of the total concentrations $D_{T}$, $C_{T}$, and the dissociation constant $K_{d}$. We must solve the system of three equations for the unknown $[X]$.\n\nFrom the conservation equations, we express the free concentrations in terms of the totals and the complex concentration:\n$[D] = D_{T} - [X]$\n$[C] = C_{T} - [X]$\n\nSubstituting these into the equilibrium expression:\n$K_{d} = \\frac{(D_{T} - [X])(C_{T} - [X])}{[X]}$\n\nThis expression can be rearranged into a quadratic equation for $[X]$:\n$K_{d}[X] = (D_{T} - [X])(C_{T} - [X])$\n$K_{d}[X] = D_{T}C_{T} - D_{T}[X] - C_{T}[X] + [X]^2$\n$$[X]^2 - (D_{T} + C_{T} + K_{d})[X] + D_{T}C_{T} = 0$$\n\nThis is a standard quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, with $x = [X]$, $a=1$, $b = -(D_{T} + C_{T} + K_{d})$, and $c = D_{T}C_{T}$. Applying the quadratic formula, we find the solutions for $[X]$:\n$$[X] = \\frac{(D_{T} + C_{T} + K_{d}) \\pm \\sqrt{(D_{T} + C_{T} + K_{d})^2 - 4D_{T}C_{T}}}{2}$$\n\nTo select the physically meaningful root, we consider that the concentration of the complex, $[X]$, cannot exceed either of the total reactant concentrations, i.e., $[X] \\le D_{T}$ and $[X] \\le C_{T}$. The solution with the plus sign leads to $[X]$ values that can violate this condition. Therefore, we must choose the minus sign, which yields the physically correct solution.\n$$[X] = \\frac{(D_{T} + C_{T} + K_{d}) - \\sqrt{(D_{T} + C_{T} + K_{d})^2 - 4D_{T}C_{T}}}{2}$$\n\nThe fraction of bound Dorsal, $f_{b}$, is then obtained by dividing $[X]$ by $D_{T}$:\n$$f_{b} = \\frac{[X]}{D_{T}} = \\frac{(D_{T} + C_{T} + K_{d}) - \\sqrt{(D_{T} + C_{T} + K_{d})^2 - 4D_{T}C_{T}}}{2D_{T}}$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of free cytoplasmic Dorsal, $D_{\\text{free}}$**\n\nThe second task is to find the concentration of free Dorsal, $D_{\\text{free}} = [D]$, as a function of the Toll signaling strength, parameterized by $k_{T}$. This requires determining the steady-state total Cactus concentration, $C_{T}$.\n\nThe dynamics of the total Cactus concentration, $C_{T}$, are governed by its synthesis and degradation. Synthesis occurs at a constant zero-order rate $s_{C}$. Degradation is a first-order process that applies to both free Cactus ($[C]$) and bound Cactus ($[X]$) with the same rate constant, $k_{deg} = k_{b} + k_{T}$. The rate of change of total Cactus is thus:\n$$\\frac{dC_{T}}{dt} = \\text{synthesis rate} - \\text{degradation rate}$$\n$$\\frac{dC_{T}}{dt} = s_{C} - k_{deg}[C] - k_{deg}[X] = s_{C} - k_{deg}([C] + [X]) = s_{C} - (k_{b} + k_{T})C_{T}$$\n\nAt steady state, $\\frac{dC_{T}}{dt} = 0$. Solving for the steady-state total Cactus concentration, which we denote $C_{T,ss}$:\n$$s_{C} - (k_{b} + k_{T})C_{T,ss} = 0$$\n$$C_{T,ss} = \\frac{s_{C}}{k_{b} + k_{T}}$$\n\nNow we have an expression for $C_{T}$ at steady state that depends on the Toll signal $k_{T}$. We can find the free Dorsal concentration, $D_{\\text{free}} = [D]$, using the relationship $[D] = D_{T} - [X] = D_{T}(1-f_{b})$. We substitute $C_{T} = C_{T,ss}$ into the expression for $f_{b}$:\n$$f_{b}(k_{T}) = \\frac{(D_{T} + \\frac{s_{C}}{k_{b} + k_{T}} + K_{d}) - \\sqrt{(D_{T} + \\frac{s_{C}}{k_{b} + k_{T}} + K_{d})^2 - 4D_{T}\\frac{s_{C}}{k_{b} + k_{T}}}}{2D_{T}}$$\n\nThen, we calculate $D_{\\text{free}} = D_{T}(1 - f_{b}(k_{T}))$:\n$$D_{\\text{free}} = D_{T} \\left( 1 - \\frac{(D_{T} + \\frac{s_{C}}{k_{b} + k_{T}} + K_{d}) - \\sqrt{(D_{T} + \\frac{s_{C}}{k_{b} + k_{T}} + K_{d})^2 - 4D_{T}\\frac{s_{C}}{k_{b} + k_{T}}}}{2D_{T}} \\right)$$\nMultiplying $D_{T}$ through the bracket:\n$$D_{\\text{free}} = \\frac{2D_{T} - \\left( (D_{T} + \\frac{s_{C}}{k_{b} + k_{T}} + K_{d}) - \\sqrt{(D_{T} + \\frac{s_{C}}{k_{b} + k_{T}} + K_{d})^2 - 4D_{T}\\frac{s_{C}}{k_{b} + k_{T}}} \\right)}{2}$$\nSimplifying the numerator gives the final expression for free Dorsal concentration as a function of $k_{T}$ and the other system parameters:\n$$D_{\\text{free}} = \\frac{D_{T} - \\frac{s_{C}}{k_{b} + k_{T}} - K_{d} + \\sqrt{(D_{T} + \\frac{s_{C}}{k_{b} + k_{T}} + K_{d})^2 - 4D_{T}\\frac{s_{C}}{k_{b} + k_{T}}}}{2}$$\nThis expression shows how the concentration of free Dorsal available for nuclear import, $[D]$, increases as the Toll-dependent degradation rate of its inhibitor, $k_{T}$, increases.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{D_{T} - K_{d} - \\frac{s_{C}}{k_{b} + k_{T}} + \\sqrt{\\left(D_{T} + K_{d} + \\frac{s_{C}}{k_{b} + k_{T}}\\right)^{2} - 4D_{T}\\frac{s_{C}}{k_{b} + k_{T}}}}{2}}$$", "id": "2684109"}, {"introduction": "Finally, how is the resulting nuclear gradient of Dorsal interpreted to create sharp, all-or-none patterns of gene expression?

This cooperative binding process can be described by an effective reaction:\n$$n D + \\text{Enhancer}_{\\text{off}} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Enhancer}_{\\text{on}}$$\nAt equilibrium, the fraction of enhancers in the active state, which we define as the occupancy $Y$, is given by the Hill equation. This equation describes the sigmoidal response characteristic of cooperative systems. The problem states that the transcriptional output, or rate $r$, is a monotonic function of this occupancy. The simplest and standard assumption is that the rate is directly proportional to the occupancy, $r(D) \\propto Y$. The maximal transcription rate, $r_{\\max}$, is achieved when all enhancers are occupied ($Y=1$). Therefore, we can write the transcription rate as a function of Dorsal concentration $D$ as:\n$$r(D) = r_{\\max} Y(D)$$\nThe Hill equation for occupancy $Y$ as a function of the ligand concentration $D$, cooperativity coefficient $n$, and an activation constant $K$ (representing the concentration of $D$ required for half-maximal activation) is:\n$$Y(D) = \\frac{D^n}{K^n + D^n}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the rate $r(D)$ yields the required Hill-function form for the transcription rate:\n$$r(D) = r_{\\max} \\frac{D^n}{K^n + D^n}$$\nThis equation correctly models a switch-like transcriptional response to the concentration of the transcription factor $D$.\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the expression boundary $x^{\\ast}$.\n\nThe expression boundary, $x^{\\ast}$, is defined as the spatial position where the transcription rate $r$ is a specific fraction $\\theta$ of its maximum value, $r_{\\max}$.
