The total receptor concentration is $[R]_{total} = [R] + [RT]$.\n- The minimum required receptor occupancy for stabilization is $\\theta_{\\min} = 0.8$.\n- The dissociation constant for the androgen receptor–testosterone interaction is given as $K_d = 2$ nM.\n- The objective is to determine the minimal free testosterone concentration, denoted as $[T]_{\\min}$, required to achieve an occupancy $\\theta$ of at least $\\theta_{\\min}$.\n- All values must be treated as exact.\n\nNext, we validate the problem's integrity.\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the well-established principles of receptor-ligand kinetics and developmental endocrinology. The mathematical model presented is the standard representation for single-site, non-cooperative binding, analogous to the Michaelis-Menten equation in enzyme kinetics or the Langmuir isotherm in surface chemistry. The parameters provided, such as a dissociation constant in the nanomolar range ($K_d = 2$ nM) and a required occupancy of $80\\%$ ($\\theta_{\\min} = 0.8$), are biologically plausible for a high-affinity hormone-receptor interaction driving a developmental switch.

It does not violate any fundamental principles of chemistry, physics, or biology. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution may be pursued.\n\nThe objective is to find the testosterone concentration $[T]$ at which the receptor occupancy $\\theta$ equals the specified minimum threshold $\\theta_{\\min}$. We begin by deriving an expression for $\\theta$ as a function of $[T]$ and $K_d$.\n\nThe definitions provided are:\n1) Receptor occupancy:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RT]}{[R] + [RT]} $$\n2) Dissociation constant:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[R][T]}{[RT]} $$\n\nFrom the second equation, we can express the concentration of free receptor, $[R]$, in terms of the other variables:\n$$ [R] = \\frac{K_d [RT]}{[T]} $$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for receptor occupancy $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RT]}{\\left(\\frac{K_d [RT]}{[T]}\\right) + [RT]} $$\n\nThe term $[RT]$ is common to the numerator and both terms in the denominator. We can factor it out from the denominator and cancel it:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RT]}{[RT] \\left(\\frac{K_d}{[T]} + 1\\right)} $$\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[T]} + 1} $$\n\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $[T]$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{1 \\cdot [T]}{\\left(\\frac{K_d}{[T]} + 1\\right) \\cdot [T]} $$\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[T]}{K_d + [T]} $$\n\nThis equation relates the receptor occupancy $\\theta$ directly to the free ligand concentration $[T]$ and the dissociation constant $K_d$. We are tasked with finding the minimum concentration $[T]_{\\min}$ that corresponds to the minimum required occupancy $\\theta_{\\min}$. Therefore, we set $\\theta = \\theta_{\\min}$ and solve for the corresponding testosterone concentration, which we will call $[T]_{\\min}$:\n$$ \\theta_{\\min} = \\frac{[T]_{\\min}}{K_d + [T]_{\\min}} $$\n\nNow, we must rearrange this equation to solve for $[T]_{\\min}$.\n$$ \\theta_{\\min} (K_d + [T]_{\\min}) = [T]_{\\min} $$\n$$ \\theta_{\\min} K_d + \\theta_{\\min} [T]_{\\min} = [T]_{\\min} $$\n\nWe gather all terms containing $[T]_{\\min}$ on one side of the equation:\n$$ \\theta_{\\min} K_d = [T]_{\\min} - \\theta_{\\min} [T]_{\\min} $$\n$$ \\theta_{\\min} K_d = [T]_{\\min} (1 - \\theta_{\\min}) $$\n\nFinally, we isolate $[T]_{\\min}$:\n$$ [T]_{\\min} = \\frac{\\theta_{\\min} K_d}{1 - \\theta_{\\min}} $$\n\nNow we substitute the provided numerical values, $\\theta_{\\min} = 0.8$ and $K_d = 2$ nM, into this expression:\n$$ [T]_{\\min} = \\frac{0.8 \\cdot (2 \\text{ nM})}{1 - 0.8} $$\n$$ [T]_{\\min} = \\frac{1.6 \\text{ nM}}{0.2} $$\n\nPerforming the division yields the final result:\n$$ [T]_{\\min} = 8 \\text{ nM} $$\n\nThis is the minimal free testosterone concentration required in the Wolffian duct mesenchyme to achieve the necessary receptor occupancy for stabilization.
