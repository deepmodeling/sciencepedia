The contribution from the lower tail, $P(\\hat{d} < -C | H_A)$, is negligible for typical effect sizes and sample sizes, so we approximate the power by considering only the upper tail:\n$$ 1-\\beta \\approx P(\\hat{d} > C | H_A) $$\nTo evaluate this probability, we standardize the variable $\\hat{d}$:\n$$ 1-\\beta = P\\left( \\frac{\\hat{d} - (p_{2}-p_{1})}{\\text{SE}_{A}(\\hat{d})} > \\frac{C - (p_{2}-p_{1})}{\\text{SE}_{A}(\\hat{d})} \\right) $$\nThe term on the left is a standard normal variable, $Z$. Thus, the expression on the right must be equal to the quantile $z_{\\beta} = -z_{1-\\beta}$:\n$$ \\frac{C - (p_{2}-p_{1})}{\\text{SE}_{A}(\\hat{d})} = -z_{1-\\beta} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $C$, $\\text{SE}_{0}$, and $\\text{SE}_{A}$:\n$$ z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{n}} - (p_{2}-p_{1}) = -z_{1-\\beta} \\sqrt{\\frac{p_{1}(1-p_{1}) + p_{2}(1-p_{2})}{n}} $$\nThis equation is now solved for the sample size $n$. Rearranging the terms:\n$$ |p_{2}-p_{1}| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\left( z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})} + z_{1-\\beta}\\sqrt{p_{1}(1-p_{1}) + p_{2}(1-p_{2})} \\right) $$\nSolving for $\\sqrt{n}$ and squaring both sides gives the general formula for the per-group sample size:\n$$ n = \\frac{\\left( z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})} + z_{1-\\beta}\\sqrt{p_{1}(1-p_{1}) + p_{2}(1-p_{2})} \\right)^2}{(p_{2}-p_{1})^2} $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$p_{1} = 0.5$\n$p_{2} = 0.7$\n$\\alpha = 0.05$\n$1-\\beta = 0.8 \\implies \\beta = 0.2$\n\nThe required quantiles are:\n$z_{1-\\alpha/2} = z_{1-0.025} = z_{0.975} \\approx 1.95996$\n$z_{1-\\beta} = z_{1-0.2} = z_{0.8} \\approx 0.84162$\n\nThe proportions for the variance calculations are:\n$|p_{2}-p_{1}| = 0.2$\n$\\bar{p} = \\frac{0.5+0.7}{2} = 0.6$\n$p_{1}(1-p_{1}) = 0.5(1-0.5) = 0.25$\n$p_{2}(1-p_{2}) = 0.7(1-0.7) = 0.21$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for $n$:\n$$ n = \\frac{\\left( 1.95996\\sqrt{2 \\cdot 0.6 \\cdot 0.4} + 0.84162\\sqrt{0.25 + 0.21} \\right)^2}{(0.2)^2} $$\n$$ n = \\frac{\\left( 1.95996\\sqrt{0.48} + 0.84162\\sqrt{0.46} \\right)^2}{0.04} $$\n$$ n = \\frac{\\left( 1.95996 \\cdot 0.692820 + 0.84162 \\cdot 0.678233 \\right)^2}{0.04} $$\n$$ n = \\frac{\\left( 1.35790 + 0.57088 \\right)^2}{0.04} $$\n$$ n = \\frac{\\left( 1.92878 \\right)^2}{0.04} = \\frac{3.72018}{0.04} \\approx 93.0045 $$\nSince the sample size $n$ must be an integer, we must take the ceiling of this value to ensure the power requirement is met or exceeded.\n$$ n = \\lceil 93.0045 \\rceil = 94 $$\nTherefore, a minimum of $94$ eggs per temperature group is required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{94}\n$$", "id": "2671234"}]}
