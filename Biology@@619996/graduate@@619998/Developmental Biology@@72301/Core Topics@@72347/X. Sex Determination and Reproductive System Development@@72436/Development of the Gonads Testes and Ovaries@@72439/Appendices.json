It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is declared valid, and we shall proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\nThe solution is derived in two parts, as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the half-maximal activation concentration, $c_{1/2}$.\nWe are required to find the concentration $c_{1/2}$ at which the output $S(c_{1/2})$ is precisely one-half of the maximal output $S_{\\max}$. The condition is:\n$$ S(c_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2}S_{\\max} $$\nSubstituting the given expression for $S(c)$:\n$$ S_{\\max}\\,\\frac{c_{1/2}^{n}}{K^{n} + c_{1/2}^{n}} = \\frac{1}{2}S_{\\max} $$\nAssuming $S_{\\max}$ represents a non-zero maximal output, we can divide both sides by $S_{\\max}$:\n$$ \\frac{c_{1/2}^{n}}{K^{n} + c_{1/2}^{n}} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nWe now solve this equation for $c_{1/2}$. Cross-multiplication gives:\n$$ 2 c_{1/2}^{n} = K^{n} + c_{1/2}^{n} $$\nSubtracting $c_{1/2}^{n}$ from both sides yields:\n$$ c_{1/2}^{n} = K^{n} $$\nGiven that $c>0$ and $K>0$, we can take the $n$-th root of both sides, where $n>0$. This gives a unique positive real solution:\n$$ c_{1/2} = K $$\nThis result confirms the definition of the parameter $K$ as the concentration required to achieve half of the maximal response.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the local log-sensitivity, $\\sigma$.\nThe log-sensitivity $\\sigma$ is defined as the derivative of the normalized response with respect to the natural logarithm of the concentration, evaluated at the half-maximal concentration point $c_{1/2}$.\nFirst, we define the normalized response, $s(c)$:\n$$ s(c) = \\frac{S(c)}{S_{\\max}} = \\frac{c^{n}}{K^{n} + c^{n}} $$\nThe definition of $\\sigma$ is:\n$$ \\sigma = \\left.\\frac{d s(c)}{d\\ln c}\\right|_{c=c_{1/2}} $$\nTo compute the derivative with respect to $\\ln c$, we use the chain rule:\n$$ \\frac{d}{d\\ln c} = \\frac{dc}{d\\ln c} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dc} $$\nLet $x = \\ln c$. Then $c = \\exp(x)$, and $\\frac{dc}{dx} = \\exp(x) = c$. Therefore, the operator is equivalent to:\n$$ \\frac{d}{d\\ln c} = c \\frac{d}{dc} $$\nSo, we must compute $\\sigma = \\left.c \\frac{ds(c)}{dc}\\right|_{c=c_{1/2}}$.\nWe first find the derivative $\\frac{ds}{dc}$ using the quotient rule for differentiation, where $u(c) = c^n$ and $v(c) = K^n + c^n$:\n\\begin{align*} \\frac{ds}{dc} &= \\frac{\\frac{d}{dc}(c^n) \\cdot (K^n + c^n) - c^n \\cdot \\frac{d}{dc}(K^n + c^n)}{(K^n + c^n)^2} \\\\ &= \\frac{(n c^{n-1})(K^n + c^n) - c^n (n c^{n-1})}{(K^n + c^n)^2} \\\\ &= \\frac{n c^{n-1}K^n + n c^{2n-1} - n c^{2n-1}}{(K^n + c^n)^2} \\\\ &= \\frac{n K^n c^{n-1}}{(K^n + c^n)^2} \\end{align*}\nNow, we multiply by $c$ to obtain the logarithmic derivative:\n$$ c \\frac{ds}{dc} = c \\left( \\frac{n K^n c^{n-1}}{(K^n + c^n)^2} \\right) = \\frac{n K^n c^n}{(K^n + c^n)^2} $$\nFinally, we evaluate this expression at $c = c_{1/2} = K$:\n$$ \\sigma = \\left. \\frac{n K^n c^n}{(K^n + c^n)^2} \\right|_{c=K} = \\frac{n K^n K^n}{(K^n + K^n)^2} $$\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{n K^{2n}}{(2K^n)^2} = \\frac{n K^{2n}}{4(K^n)^2} = \\frac{n K^{2n}}{4K^{2n}} $$\nSince $K>0$, $K^{2n} \\neq 0$, so we can cancel this term from the numerator and denominator:\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{n}{4} $$\nThis result shows that the local sensitivity of the normalized response at its half-maximal point is directly proportional to the Hill coefficient $n$, providing a quantitative meaning for $n$ as a measure of the steepness, or ultrasensitivity, of the response.\n\nThe final answer is the pair $(c_{1/2}, \\sigma)$.\n$$ c_{1/2} = K $$\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{n}{4} $$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} K & \\frac{n}{4} \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "2628625"}, {"introduction": "Cell fate decisions, like the choice between testis and ovary, must be robust and essentially binary. This practice examines how such definitive outcomes can emerge from network-level interactions, specifically modeling the mutual antagonism between SRY-box transcription factor 9 (SOX9) and β-catenin as a \"toggle switch.\" Through mathematical analysis, we will uncover the principles of bistability and hysteresis, revealing how this classic network motif can convert a transient developmental signal into a permanent cellular memory that locks in a specific fate [@problem_id:2628685].", "problem": "In the bipotential gonad, fate choice between testis and ovary is governed by a mutually antagonistic gene regulatory toggle between SRY-box transcription factor $9$ (SOX$9$) and beta-catenin (the downstream effector of the Wingless/Integrated (WNT) pathway).

The $y$-nullcline is a sigmoidal curve that decreases from $y=\\alpha$ at $x=0$ to $y \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$. The $x$-nullcline has the same shape but is reflected across the line $y=x$.\n\nDue to the symmetry of the equations, there is always at least one fixed point on the line $x=y$. Let this symmetric equilibrium be $(s, s)$. Substituting $x=y=s$ into the nullcline equation yields:\n$$\ns = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + s^{h}}\n$$\nBistability requires the existence of three fixed points. Geometrically, this occurs when the nullclines intersect three times. This happens if, at the symmetric fixed point $(s,s)$, the slope of the $y$-nullcline, $\\frac{dy}{dx}$, is sufficiently steep. Specifically, the condition for multiple intersections is that the magnitude of the slope of the $y$-nullcline at $x=s$ must be greater than $1$. If $|\\frac{dy}{dx}|_{x=s} > 1$, the nullclines must cross again on either side of the symmetric point. The two outer fixed points will be stable, while the central one will be an unstable saddle, creating two basins of attraction. This is the geometric origin of bistability and hysteresis.\n\nThe onset of bistability occurs when the central symmetric equilibrium loses its stability. This corresponds to a pitchfork bifurcation. We analyze the linear stability of the symmetric equilibrium $(s,s)$. The Jacobian matrix $J$ of the system is:\n$$\nJ(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -\\frac{\\alpha h y^{h-1}}{(1+y^{h})^2} \\\\ -\\frac{\\alpha h x^{h-1}}{(1+x^{h})^2} & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nEvaluating the Jacobian at the symmetric fixed point $(s, s)$:\n$$\nJ(s,s) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -\\frac{\\alpha h s^{h-1}}{(1+s^{h})^2} \\\\ -\\frac{\\alpha h s^{h-1}}{(1+s^{h})^2} & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nLet's define the off-diagonal term as $k = -\\frac{\\alpha h s^{h-1}}{(1+s^{h})^2}$. The Jacobian becomes $J(s,s) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & k \\\\ k & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are found from the characteristic equation $\\det(J - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$\n(-1 - \\lambda)^2 - k^2 = 0 \\implies -1 - \\lambda = \\pm k \\implies \\lambda = -1 \\pm k\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_{1} = -1 - |k|$ and $\\lambda_{2} = -1 + |k|$.\nNote that $|k| = \\frac{\\alpha h s^{h-1}}{(1+s^{h})^2} \\ge 0$.\nThe eigenvalue $\\lambda_{1}$ is always negative. The stability of the equilibrium is therefore determined by $\\lambda_{2}$. The fixed point is stable if $\\lambda_{2} < 0$, which means $|k| < 1$. The fixed point loses stability when $\\lambda_{2}$ crosses zero, i.e., at $\\lambda_2 = 0$. This bifurcation occurs precisely when $|k|=1$.\n\nThe pitchfork bifurcation creating bistability occurs at the critical production strength $\\alpha_{c}$ where the following two conditions are met simultaneously:\n$1$. The point $(s,s)$ is an equilibrium: $s = \\frac{\\alpha_{c}}{1 + s^{h}}$\n$2$. The bifurcation condition is met: $|k| = 1 \\implies \\frac{\\alpha_{c} h s^{h-1}}{(1+s^{h})^2} = 1$\n\nWe must now solve this system of two equations for $\\alpha_c$ in terms of $h$.\nFrom condition $1$, we can write $\\alpha_{c} = s(1+s^{h})$. Substitute this into condition $2$:\n$$\n\\frac{s(1+s^{h}) h s^{h-1}}{(1+s^{h})^2} = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{h s^{h}}{1+s^{h}} = 1\n$$\n$$\nh s^{h} = 1 + s^{h}\n$$\n$$\n(h-1)s^{h} = 1\n$$\nThis gives $s^{h} = \\frac{1}{h-1}$. For a real, positive solution for $s$, we must have $h>1$, which is consistent with the requirement of cooperativity for a switch-like response.\nFrom this, we find $s = \\left(\\frac{1}{h-1}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{h}} = (h-1)^{-\\frac{1}{h}}$.\n\nNow, we substitute this back into the expression for $\\alpha_{c}$:\n$$\n\\alpha_{c} = s(1+s^{h}) = (h-1)^{-\\frac{1}{h}} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{h-1}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_{c} = (h-1)^{-\\frac{1}{h}} \\left(\\frac{h-1+1}{h-1}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_{c} = (h-1)^{-\\frac{1}{h}} \\left(\\frac{h}{h-1}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_{c} = h \\cdot (h-1)^{-1} \\cdot (h-1)^{-\\frac{1}{h}} = h (h-1)^{-(1+\\frac{1}{h})}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_{c}(h) = h (h-1)^{-\\frac{h+1}{h}}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the critical production strength.\n\nTask $2$: Hysteresis and Filtering of Fluctuations\n\nWhen $\\alpha > \\alpha_{c}(h)$, the system is bistable. The phase plane contains three fixed points: two stable fixed points (nodes or foci) and one unstable saddle point at the center. The stable fixed points represent the determined cell fates: one with high $x$ (SOX$9$) and low $y$ (beta-catenin), corresponding to the testis fate, and the other with low $x$ and high $y$, corresponding to the ovary fate.\n\nThe phase space is partitioned into two basins of attraction. The boundary between these basins is a curve known as the separatrix, which is the stable manifold of the saddle point. Trajectories starting on one side of the separatrix will converge to one stable fixed point, while trajectories starting on the other side will converge to the other.\n\nThis structure explains how the system filters transient fluctuations. Suppose the system resides at the \"ovary\" stable state (low $x$, high $y$). A transient input $u(t)$ of duration $T$ acts as a perturbation that drives an increase in $x$. This pushes the state of the system $(x(t), y(t))$ away from its initial equilibrium.\n\nIf the perturbation is small (in amplitude or duration $T$), the state trajectory will be displaced but will remain within the initial basin of attraction. When the input $u(t)$ ceases at time $t=T$, the state $(x(T), y(T))$ has not crossed the separatrix. The system's dynamics will then cause the state to relax back to the original \"ovary\" stable fixed point. In this case, the transient signal is filtered out, and no permanent change in cell fate occurs.\n\nHowever, if the input $u(t)$ is sufficiently strong or prolonged, it can push the state of the system across the separatrix into the basin of attraction of the \"testis\" state. At the moment the pulse ends at time $t=T$, the state $(x(T), y(T))$ is now in the other basin. The system's intrinsic dynamics will then guide the trajectory not back to the original state, but forward to the other stable fixed point (high $x$, low $y$). This results in a permanent, irreversible switch in cell fate.\n\nTherefore, the separatrix acts as a critical threshold. The geometry of bistability provides robustness by ignoring sub-threshold noise and fluctuations, while responding decisively to supra-threshold signals. This property, where the system's final state depends on its history of large perturbations, is the definition of hysteresis.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{h (h-1)^{-\\frac{h+1}{h}}}\n$$", "id": "2628685"}, {"introduction": "A robust genetic switch is necessary but not sufficient for correct development, as the timing of its activation is equally critical.

It is a standard exercise in probability theory applied to a biological context.

This event is the union of two other events: $\\{T < t_{1}\\}$ and $\\{T > t_{2}\\}$. We are asked to find $\\mathbb{P}(T < t_{1} \\text{ or } T > t_{2})$, which can be written as $\\mathbb{P}(\\{T < t_{1}\\} \\cup \\{T > t_{2}\\})$.\n\nGiven the condition $t_{1} < t_{2}$, the events $\\{T < t_{1}\\}$ and $\\{T > t_{2}\\}$ are mutually exclusive (disjoint). A single realization of the random variable $T$ cannot be simultaneously less than $t_{1}$ and greater than $t_{2}$. For disjoint events, the probability of their union is the sum of their individual probabilities.\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(\\{T < t_{1}\\} \\cup \\{T > t_{2}\\}) = \\mathbb{P}(T < t_{1}) + \\mathbb{P}(T > t_{2}) $$\nThe random variable $T$ follows a normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^{2}$, written as $T \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$. To compute these probabilities, we must use the provided standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF), $\\Phi(z)$, which is the CDF for a standard normal variable $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$. This requires standardizing the variable $T$.\n\nThe standardized form of $T$ is the random variable $Z = \\frac{T - \\mu}{\\sigma}$. This variable $Z$ has a mean of $0$ and a variance of $1$.\n\nLet us evaluate the first term, $\\mathbb{P}(T < t_{1})$. We transform the inequality for $T$ into an inequality for $Z$:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(T < t_{1}) = \\mathbb{P}(T - \\mu < t_{1} - \\mu) $$\nSince $\\sigma > 0$, dividing by $\\sigma$ preserves the inequality direction:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(T < t_{1}) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\frac{T - \\mu}{\\sigma} < \\frac{t_{1} - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(Z < \\frac{t_{1} - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) $$\nBy definition of the CDF for a standard normal variable, $\\mathbb{P}(Z \\le z) = \\Phi(z)$. For any continuous random variable, the probability of being strictly less than a value is equal to the probability of being less than or equal to that value. Thus, $\\mathbb{P}(Z < z) = \\mathbb{P}(Z \\le z) = \\Phi(z)$.\nTherefore, the first term is:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(T < t_{1}) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{t_{1} - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) $$\nNext, we evaluate the second term, $\\mathbb{P}(T > t_{2})$. We use the property that for any continuous random variable $X$, $\\mathbb{P}(X > x) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(X \\le x)$.\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(T > t_{2}) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(T \\le t_{2}) $$\nWe again standardize the variable $T$:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(T \\le t_{2}) = \\mathbb{P}(T - \\mu \\le t_{2} - \\mu) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\frac{T - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\le \\frac{t_{2} - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(Z \\le \\frac{t_{2} - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) $$\nThis expression is, by definition, the standard normal CDF evaluated at $\\frac{t_{2} - \\mu}{\\sigma}$:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(T \\le t_{2}) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{t_{2} - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\mathbb{P}(T > t_{2})$ gives:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(T > t_{2}) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{t_{2} - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) $$\nFinally, we sum the probabilities of the two disjoint events to find the total probability of failure:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(\\text{failure}) = \\mathbb{P}(T < t_{1}) + \\mathbb{P}(T > t_{2}) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{t_{1} - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) + \\left[1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{t_{2} - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)\\right] $$\nThis simplifies to the final analytical expression:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(\\text{failure}) = 1 + \\Phi\\left(\\frac{t_{1} - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{t_{2} - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) $$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the probability that the *SRY* transcriptional burst misses the competency window, given in terms of the specified parameters and the standard normal CDF.
