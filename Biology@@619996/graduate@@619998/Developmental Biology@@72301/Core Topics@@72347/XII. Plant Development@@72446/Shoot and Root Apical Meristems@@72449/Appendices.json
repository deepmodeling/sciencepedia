A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe task is to derive the characteristic length scale, $\\ell$, that governs the spatial decay of the morphogen concentration, $c(x)$, at steady state and away from the source region. The governing equation is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients:\n$$\nD\\,\\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} - \\lambda\\,c = 0\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged as:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} = \\frac{\\lambda}{D}\\,c\n$$\nFor this equation to be dimensionally consistent, the coefficient $\\frac{\\lambda}{D}$ must have dimensions of inverse length squared, $[L]^{-2}$. We can verify this from the given units. The units of $D$ are $[L]^2[T]^{-1}$ (e.g., $\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$) and the units of $\\lambda$ are $[T]^{-1}$ (e.g., $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). Therefore, the units of the ratio $\\frac{\\lambda}{D}$ are:\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\lambda}{D}\\right] = \\frac{[T]^{-1}}{[L]^2 [T]^{-1}} = \\frac{1}{[L]^2}\n$$\nThis confirms the dimensional consistency.

The term $\\sqrt{k}$ in the exponent determines the characteristic length scale over which the function $y(x)$ changes. Specifically, the characteristic length $\\ell$ is the distance over which the solution decays by a factor of $e$, and it is equal to $1/\\sqrt{k}$.\n\nIn our problem, the role of $k$ is played by the term $\\frac{\\lambda}{D}$. Thus, we can define the characteristic length squared, $\\ell^2$, as the inverse of this term:\n$$\n\\ell^2 = \\frac{D}{\\lambda}\n$$\nTaking the square root gives the expression for the characteristic diffusion length scale:\n$$\n\\ell = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{\\lambda}}\n$$\nThis is the fundamental length scale that emerges from the balance between diffusion, which spreads the morphogen, and removal, which eliminates it.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $\\ell$ using the supplied parameters:\n- $D = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$\n- $\\lambda = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\n\\ell = \\sqrt{\\frac{20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}}{0.01\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}}\n$$\nThe units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ cancel, leaving $\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2$ under the square root, which correctly yields a final unit of $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ for length.\n$$\n\\ell = \\sqrt{\\frac{20}{0.01}}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = \\sqrt{2000}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nTo compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\ell = \\sqrt{2000} = \\sqrt{400 \\times 5} = 20\\sqrt{5} \\approx 20 \\times 2.2360679... \\approx 44.721359... \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\ell \\approx 44.72\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nFor biological interpretation, we compare this length scale to the diameter of the source, the Quiescent Center, given as $d_{\\mathrm{QC}} = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.

Two mechanistic classes are often invoked for primordium spacing: Turing-type reaction–diffusion mechanisms and auxin transport-based mechanisms.

Turing-type reaction–diffusion models generically produce a characteristic primordium spacing wavelength set by $D_a$, $D_h$, and reaction kinetics, without requiring directed carrier-mediated fluxes or membrane polarization, so they do not predict coordinated, stimulus-locked reorientation of PIN1 polarity vectors. Auxin transport-based models predict that PIN1 polarizes up auxin gradients to create convergence points, so a localized exogenous auxin source applied at the SAM periphery should recruit surrounding PIN1::GFP polarity vectors to reorient toward the source and induce an ectopic primordium. Observing directed PIN1 reorientation toward the source supports the auxin transport mechanism; failure of such reorientation, with spacing unchanged, supports a Turing mechanism.\n\nB. Turing-type reaction–diffusion models require PIN1-mediated flux to maintain the inhibitor field; thus inhibiting PIN1 with naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) should abolish primordium spacing immediately, whereas auxin transport-based models are robust to NPA because reaction kinetics dominate. Therefore, under NPA treatment, primordium spacing should persist and PIN1::GFP should remain polarly localized, discriminating in favor of auxin transport-based models.\n\nC. Turing-type reaction–diffusion models predict spiral rotation of PIN1 polarity chevrons as a prepattern; therefore, laser ablation of a cell row in the SAM to perturb mechanical stress will cause PIN1 polarity to reorient away from the ablation site, uniquely supporting a Turing mechanism.

The task is to identify a decisive experiment using a PIN1::GFP reporter that can distinguish between these two mechanisms. The problem is scientifically valid, well-posed, and based on established concepts in developmental biology and theoretical biology.\n\nFirst, let us analyze the fundamental principles of the two proposed model classes.\n\n1.  **Turing-type reaction–diffusion mechanism**: This class of models posits that spatial patterns arise spontaneously from the interaction of at least two chemical species, an activator $a(\\mathbf{x},t)$ and an inhibitor $h(\\mathbf{x},t)$, which diffuse and react in a tissue. The governing equations are:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial t} = f(a,h) + D_a \\nabla^2 a\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} = g(a,h) + D_h \\nabla^2 h\n    $$\n    A key condition for diffusion-driven instability and pattern formation is that the inhibitor must diffuse significantly faster than the activator, i.e., $D_h \\gg D_a$. This leads to a \"short-range activation, long-range inhibition\" scenario. The crucial point is that the resulting pattern—a periodic array of high activator concentration peaks—has a characteristic wavelength, $\\lambda$, which is an intrinsic property of the system, determined by the diffusion coefficients ($D_a, D_h$) and the reaction kinetics ($f, g$). The transport of both $a$ and $h$ is isotropic diffusion, modeled by the Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2$. In this framework, polar transport via carriers like PIN1 is not a necessary component for pattern formation itself. If PIN1 dynamics are observed, they are considered a downstream consequence of the chemical pre-pattern laid down by the Turing mechanism, not the cause of it.\n\n2.  **Auxin transport-based mechanism**: This model places the primary causal role on the active, polar transport of the plant hormone auxin. The concentration of auxin, $A_i$, in a cell $i$ is governed by synthesis $S_i$, degradation $\\mu A_i$, and transport between neighboring cells $j \\in \\mathcal{N}(i)$. The flux is mediated by efflux carriers like PIN1, whose effective permeability is $P_{ij}$. The central feature is a positive feedback loop where the permeability $P_{ij}$ itself depends on the auxin gradient:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P_{ij}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\alpha\\, \\Phi\\big(A_j - A_i\\big) - \\gamma P_{ij}\n    $$\n    This equation signifies that transport is enhanced towards neighbors with higher auxin concentration (an \"up-the-gradient\" rule, where $\\Phi$ is a monotonically increasing function). This feedback mechanism causes a spontaneous symmetry breaking, where stochastic fluctuations in auxin concentration are amplified, leading to the formation of stable auxin maxima (convergence points) which then trigger primordium initiation. The spacing between these maxima arises from the depletion of auxin in the surrounding tissue, which acts as an inhibitory field. In stark contrast to the Turing model, the dynamic, feedback-regulated reorientation of PIN1 polarity is the direct and causal engine of pattern formation.\n\nA decisive experiment must exploit a fundamental difference in the predictions of these two models. The most salient difference lies in the causal role of PIN1 polarity. In the auxin transport model, PIN1 polarity is the primary driver and is dynamically responsive to auxin gradients. In the Turing model, PIN1 polarity is secondary, a downstream effect of a pre-pattern with an intrinsic, robust wavelength.\n\nThe ideal experiment, therefore, is to introduce a controlled perturbation to the auxin landscape and observe the response of PIN1 polarity using the PIN1::GFP reporter. A localized application of exogenous auxin to the periphery of the Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM) serves as such a perturbation.\n\n-   **Prediction of the Auxin Transport Model**: The local, high concentration of the applied auxin will act as a strong signal. According to the equation for $P_{ij}$, cells surrounding the source will experience a large, positive $A_j - A_i$ (where cell $j$ is the source). This will drive a rapid increase in $P_{ij}$, causing PIN1::GFP to accumulate on the cell membranes facing the source. This coordinated reorientation of PIN1 polarity will canalize endogenous auxin towards the artificial sink, creating a new, stable auxin maximum and inducing an ectopic primordium.\n-   **Prediction of the Turing Model**: The pattern is robustly determined by the system's intrinsic wavelength. A local auxin cue, unless it is one of the morphogens $a$ or $h$, is a downstream signal. Even if auxin is the activator $a$, the long-range inhibitor $h$ produced by existing or incipient peaks should suppress the formation of a new peak at a non-characteristic distance. The system should resist such a perturbation. Critically, since PIN1 is not the primary patterning agent, there is no mechanism for a large-scale, coordinated reorientation of PIN1 polarity to *create* a new peak against the dictates of the reaction-diffusion system. Therefore, one would not expect to see a directed recruitment of PIN1 polarity vectors from the surrounding tissue toward the source, and the original spacing should remain largely intact.\n\nWith this analysis, we can evaluate the options.\n\n**A. Turing-type reaction–diffusion models generically produce a characteristic primordium spacing wavelength set by $D_a$, $D_h$, and reaction kinetics, without requiring directed carrier-mediated fluxes or membrane polarization, so they do not predict coordinated, stimulus-locked reorientation of PIN1 polarity vectors. Auxin transport-based models predict that PIN1 polarizes up auxin gradients to create convergence points, so a localized exogenous auxin source applied at the SAM periphery should recruit surrounding PIN1::GFP polarity vectors to reorient toward the source and induce an ectopic primordium. Observing directed PIN1 reorientation toward the source supports the auxin transport mechanism; failure of such reorientation, with spacing unchanged, supports a Turing mechanism.**\nThis option correctly summarizes the core tenets of both models and their differential predictions. It accurately describes that the Turing pattern wavelength is intrinsic and that the mechanism does not rely on polar transport. It correctly identifies the PIN1 up-the-gradient polarization as the central feedback in the auxin transport model. The proposed experiment—local auxin application—and the interpretation of the PIN1::GFP response are exactly the decisive test derived from first principles. This experiment directly probes the causal role (or lack thereof) of dynamic PIN1 polarity.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Turing-type reaction–diffusion models require PIN1-mediated flux to maintain the inhibitor field; thus inhibiting PIN1 with naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) should abolish primordium spacing immediately, whereas auxin transport-based models are robust to NPA because reaction kinetics dominate. Therefore, under NPA treatment, primordium spacing should persist and PIN1::GFP should remain polarly localized, discriminating in favor of auxin transport-based models.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. A canonical Turing model does not involve or require PIN1-mediated flux; it relies on isotropic diffusion. Therefore, a pure Turing model would be unaffected by NPA, a polar transport inhibitor. Conversely, the auxin transport-based model is entirely dependent on PIN1-mediated flux. NPA, by blocking PIN1, would cripple this mechanism, abolishing de novo primordium formation. The option states the exact opposite for both models.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Turing-type reaction–diffusion models predict spiral rotation of PIN1 polarity chevrons as a prepattern; therefore, laser ablation of a cell row in the SAM to perturb mechanical stress will cause PIN1 polarity to reorient away from the ablation site, uniquely supporting a Turing mechanism. Auxin transport-based models would not change PIN1 polarity after such ablation because polarity is hard-wired.**\nThis option contains multiple inaccuracies. First, Turing models generate stationary patterns of concentration; they do not generically predict rotating polarity fields. Second, the assertion that auxin transport models have \"hard-wired\" polarity is false; the provided equation for $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}P_{ij}}{\\mathrm{d}t}$ explicitly defines polarity as dynamic and responsive to local cues. Laser ablation would disrupt auxin distribution, and thus PIN1 polarity would be expected to reorient in an auxin transport model. Finally, linking mechanical stress responses uniquely to a Turing mechanism is an unsubstantiated claim.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Both Turing-type reaction–diffusion and auxin transport-based models predict indistinguishable PIN1::GFP dynamics in response to localized auxin perturbations, so only direct auxin concentration measurements, not PIN1 polarity imaging, can distinguish them; thus a PIN1::GFP-based experiment cannot be decisive in principle.**\nThis option claims that the proposed experimental approach is futile. As demonstrated in the analysis for option A, this is false. The two model classes make qualitatively different predictions about the response of PIN1 polarity to a local auxin source. The auxin transport model predicts a robust, directed reorientation of PIN1 towards the source, as this is the core of its patterning mechanism. A pure Turing model does not predict this causal, organizing response. Therefore, a PIN1::GFP-based experiment is indeed decisive in principle.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2671799"}, {"introduction": "After conceptually comparing models of pattern formation, the next step is to build one to see it in action.

Before proceeding to the solution, a rigorous validation of the problem statement is required.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\nThe system is defined by the following components:\n- **Domain**: A ring of $N$ cells, indexed $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$ with periodic boundaries.\n- **State Variable**: Auxin concentration $a_i(t)$ in cell $i$ at time step $t$.\n- **Update Rule**: The change in auxin concentration is given by the explicit forward Euler discretization:\n$$a_i(t+1) = a_i(t) + \\Delta a_i(t),$$\nwhere the total change $\\Delta a_i(t)$ is the sum of several terms:\n$$ \\Delta a_i(t) = \\underbrace{D (a_{i-1}(t) - 2 a_i(t) + a_{i+1}(t))}_{\\text{Diffusion}} + \\underbrace{\\max\\{ I_0 (1 - \\alpha S_i(t)), 0 \\}}_{\\text{Inhibited Import}} \\underbrace{- \\lambda a_i(t)}_{\\text{Clearance}} \\underbrace{- \\beta S_i(t) a_i(t)}_{\\text{Inhibitory Sink}}. $$\n- **Non-negativity**: $a_i(t+1)$ is clipped to $0$ if its calculated value is negative.\n- **Inhibitory Field**: The field $S_i(t)$ at cell $i$ is a sum of contributions from all existing primordia $p$ in the set $\\mathcal{P}(t)$:\n$$ S_i(t) = \\sum_{p \\in \\mathcal{P}(t)} A_0 \\exp\\Big(-\\frac{\\tau_p(t)}{\\tau}\\Big) \\exp\\Big(-\\frac{d(i,j_p)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}\\Big), $$\nwhere $j_p$ is the position and $\\tau_p(t)$ is the age of primordium $p$. The distance $d(i, j_p)$ is the shortest wrap-around distance on the ring: $d(i,j_p) = \\min\\{|i - j_p|, N - |i - j_p|\\}$.\n- **Parameters**: $N, T, D, I_0, \\lambda, \\alpha, \\beta, A_0, \\tau, \\sigma, \\theta, r, \\rho, a_{\\text{init}}$.\n- **Initial Conditions**: $a_i(0) = a_{\\text{init}}$ for all $i$. The set of initial primordia $\\mathcal{P}(0)$ is given with their positions and ages.\n- **Primordium Initiation Conditions**: A new primordium forms at cell $i$ at time $t$ if and only if:\n    1. $a_i(t) > \\theta$ (Threshold).\n    2. $a_i(t) > a_{i-1}(t)$ and $a_i(t) > a_{i+1}(t)$ (Local Maximum).\n    3. $d(i, j_p) \\ge r$ for all $p \\in \\mathcal{P}(t)$ (Exclusion Radius).\n- **Conflict Resolution for Multiple Initiations**: If multiple cells meet the criteria, they are sorted by descending $a_i(t)$ (primary key) and ascending index $i$ (tie-breaker). A greedy selection process accepts candidates from this list, ensuring each new initiation site is at least a distance $r$ from all previously accepted sites *within the same time step*.\n- **Post-Initiation Events**: For each new primordium at index $i$:\n    1. It is added to the set of primordia with age $0$.\n    2. The local auxin is reset: $a_i(t) \\leftarrow \\rho \\, a_i(t)$. This reset value is used in the calculation for the next time step, $a_j(t+1)$.\n- **Time Evolution**: Ages of all primordia are incremented by $1$ at the end of each time step.\n- **Output**: A list of lists, where each inner list contains the indices of newly initiated primordia for a given test case, ordered chronologically and then by index.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem is evaluated against the established validation criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The model is a form of a reaction-diffusion system, a classic and powerful framework in theoretical biology for explaining pattern formation. The specific mechanisms—auxin transport, accumulation, and inhibition from existing structures—are central to the established theory of phyllotaxis. The mathematical formulation (discrete Laplacian, exponential decay, Gaussian kernels) is standard and appropriate. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is deterministic. All parameters, initial conditions, and rules of evolution are specified unambiguously. The procedure for handling multiple simultaneous initiations, including sorting and greedy selection, ensures a unique outcome. The system is well-posed.\n- **Objective**: The problem statement is written in precise, objective, and mathematical language. There are no subjective or opinion-based elements.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: All necessary parameters and initial conditions are provided for each test case. The rules are internally consistent. The order of operations within a time step is logical: check for initiations based on the current state, resolve conflicts, update the state (auxin reset and primordia list), and then compute the next state.\n- **Feasibility**: The model is a straightforward numerical simulation. The choice of diffusion coefficient $D=0.2$ with effective time step $\\Delta t=1$ and space step $\\Delta x=1$ satisfies the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition for an explicit diffusion scheme ($D \\Delta t / (\\Delta x)^2 \\le 0.5$), suggesting numerical stability. The test cases are well-designed to probe different regimes of the model's behavior.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a well-defined, scientifically relevant, and numerically tractable problem in computational developmental biology. I will therefore proceed to construct the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Implementation Strategy\n\nThe solution requires implementing a discrete-time simulation according to the specified rules. The core of the implementation will be a loop that iterates through time from $t=0$ to $T-1$. Within each time step, the following sequence of operations must be performed precisely as specified.\n\n**Algorithm Outline:**\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    - Initialize the auxin concentration array `a` of size $N$ with the value $a_{\\text{init}}$.\n    - Initialize the list of primordia, `primordia`, from the given initial positions and ages. Each primordium will be stored as a tuple `(position, age)`.\n    - Initialize an empty list, `all_new_primordia_indices`, to collect the results.\n\n2.  **Time-Stepping Loop** (for $t$ from $0$ to $T-1$):\n    a.  **Calculate Inhibition Field $S(t)$**:\n        - Create a zero array `S` of size $N$.\n        - For each primordium $(j_p, \\tau_p)$ in the current `primordia` list:\n            - Calculate the age-dependent amplitude: $A_p = A_0 \\exp(-\\tau_p / \\tau)$.\n            - For each cell $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, N-1\\}$:\n                - Compute the periodic distance $d(i, j_p)$.\n                - Add the contribution to the inhibition field: $S[i] \\leftarrow S[i] + A_p \\exp(-d(i, j_p)^2 / (2\\sigma^2))$.\n\n    b.  **Identify Initiation Candidates**:\n        - Create an empty list `candidates`.\n        - For each cell $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, N-1\\}$:\n            - Check the three initiation conditions:\n                i.  $a_i(t) > \\theta$.\n                ii. $a_i(t) > a_{i-1}(t)$ and $a_i(t) > a_{i+1}(t)$ (using periodic indices).\n                iii. For all primordia $(j_p, \\tau_p)$, $d(i, j_p) \\ge r$.\n            - If all conditions are satisfied, add the tuple `(a[i], i)` to `candidates`.\n\n    c.  **Select New Primordia (Greedy Selection)**:\n        - Sort `candidates` in descending order of auxin concentration, with ascending index as a tie-breaker.\n        - Create an empty list `new_primordia_this_step` to store the indices of primordia initiated in the current time step.\n        - Iterate through the sorted `candidates`: for each candidate $(a_{\\text{cand}}, i_{\\text{cand}})$:\n            - Check if $i_{\\text{cand}}$ is at least a distance $r$ from all indices already in `new_primordia_this_step`.\n            - If it is compatible, add $i_{\\text{cand}}$ to `new_primordia_this_step`.\n        - Sort `new_primordia_this_step` by index in ascending order and append its elements to `all_new_primordia_indices`.\n\n    d.  **Update State for Next Time Step**:\n        - Create a copy of the current auxin array `a`, let's call it `a_update`, to be used for the calculation. This preserves the original `a(t)` for the update rule calculation while allowing for local resets.\n        - For each newly initiated primordium index $i$ in `new_primordia_this_step`:\n            - Apply the auxin reset: $a_{\\text{update}}[i] \\leftarrow \\rho \\cdot a_{\\text{update}}[i]$.\n        - Create a new list for primordia at time $t+1$, `next_primordia`.\n        - Add newly formed primordia to `next_primordia`, each with age $0$.\n        - Add all existing primordia from the `primordia` list to `next_primordia`, with their ages incremented by $1$.\n        - Replace the old `primordia` list with `next_primordia`.\n\n    e.  **Compute Auxin Concentrations for $t+1$**:\n        - Create a new array `a_next` of size $N$.\n        - For each cell $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, N-1\\}$:\n            - Calculate the discrete Laplacian (diffusion term) using values from `a_update`.\n            - Calculate the import, clearance, and inhibitory sink terms using values from `a_update` and the field `S`.\n            - Sum all terms to find $a_{\\text{next}}[i]$ according to the update rule.\n        - Apply the non-negativity constraint: $a \\leftarrow \\max(a_{\\text{next}}, 0)$.\n\n3.  **Finalization**:\n    - After the loop completes, return `all_new_primordia_indices`.\n\nThis algorithm will be implemented in Python using the `numpy` library for efficient array operations, which is critical for the performance of the simulation. The final program will encapsulate this logic and apply it to each of the four provided test cases, formatting the output string as required.", "answer": "[[11,33,55],[],[],[]]", "id": "2671825"}]}
