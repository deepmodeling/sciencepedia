The language is objective and unambiguous. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem describes irreversible cell wall expansion, a process correctly formalized by the Lockhart-Ortega equation. The irreversible areal strain rate, $r$, is given by the relation:\n$$r = \\phi (P - Y)$$\nThis equation is valid only when the turgor pressure $P$ exceeds the wall yield threshold $Y$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the steady-state strain rate, $r$, which corresponds to the initial conditions given, where the system is in a \"steady-state regime.\" We denote the initial yield threshold as $Y_0 = Y(m_0)$.\nThe given parameters are $P = 2.5 \\times 10^{5}$ Pa, the initial yield threshold $Y_0 = 2.0 \\times 10^{5}$ Pa, and the wall extensibility $\\phi = 2.0 \\times 10^{-7}$ Pa$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$.\nThe condition for growth, $P > Y_0$, is satisfied, as $2.5 \\times 10^{5} > 2.0 \\times 10^{5}$.\nWe substitute the values into the Lockhart-Ortega equation:\n$$r = \\phi (P - Y_0)$$\n$$r = (2.0 \\times 10^{-7}) \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{5} - 2.0 \\times 10^{5})$$\n$$r = (2.0 \\times 10^{-7}) \\times (0.5 \\times 10^{5})$$\n$$r = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, as required, gives $r = 1.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n\nSecond, we compute the new yield threshold, $Y(m_{1})$. The problem states that the yield threshold $Y$ is proportional to the fraction of de-methylesterified pectin, which is $(1 - m)$.

Guidance is driven by diffusible attractants secreted by synergids (for example, small cysteine-rich peptides) that bind receptors on the pollen tube apex, and tube reception requires signaling through the synergid membrane receptor-like kinase FERONIA and associated partners that respond to male-derived ligands (for example, Rapid Alkalinization Factor (RALF) peptides). Consider a minimal, biophysically grounded model in which each synergid is treated as a point source of attractant in a homogeneous extracellular medium. Assume the following first-principle relationships and parameters.\n\n- For a point source with constant emission rate $Q$ into a medium of diffusion coefficient $D$, the steady-state concentration at distance $r$ is $C(r) = \\dfrac{Q}{4\\pi D r}$.

The assumptions, such as linear addition of concentrations from two sources, are appropriate for a diffusion-based model. The question is unambiguous and asks for a direct comparison between a control (two synergids) and an experimental (one synergid) condition. The setup is self-contained and free of contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a rigorous and scientifically relevant exercise combining biophysical modeling with biological principles. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires calculating the guidance signal $A$ for both the normal two-synergid case and the one-synergid ablation case, and then interpreting the results in the context of the stated biological functions. For simplicity, the proportionality constant relating $A$ and $f^n$ is set to $1$.\n\n**Case 1: Two Synergids (Control)**\n\n1.  **Calculate the total attractant concentration $C_2$ at the pollen tube apex.**\n    The pollen tube is at a distance $R$ from the synergids. With two synergids, each acting as a point source, the total concentration is the sum of the concentrations from each.\n    $$C_2 = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi D R} + \\frac{Q}{4\\pi D R} = 2 \\times \\frac{Q}{4\\pi D R}$$\n    Substituting the given parameters $Q=1$, $D=1$, and $R=1$:\n    $$C_2 = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{4\\pi(1)(1)} = \\frac{2}{4\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}$$\n    Numerically, $C_2 \\approx \\frac{1}{2 \\times 3.14159} \\approx 0.15915$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the receptor occupancy $f_2$.**\n    Using the formula $f = \\frac{C}{C + K_d}$ with $K_d = 0.05$:\n    $$f_2 = \\frac{C_2}{C_2 + K_d} = \\frac{0.15915}{0.15915 + 0.05} = \\frac{0.15915}{0.20915} \\approx 0.76092$$\n\n3.  **Calculate the guidance signal $A_2$.**\n    Using $A = f^n$ and $n=2$:\n    $$A_2 = f_2^2 \\approx (0.76092)^2 \\approx 0.57899$$\n    This value is approximately $0.58$.\n\n**Case 2: One Synergid (Ablation)**\n\n1.  **Calculate the attractant concentration $C_1$ at the pollen tube apex.**\n    With one synergid ablated, there is only a single source.\n    $$C_1 = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi D R} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi(1)(1)} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi}$$\n    Numerically, $C_1 \\approx \\frac{1}{4 \\times 3.14159} \\approx 0.07958$. This is exactly half of $C_2$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the receptor occupancy $f_1$.**\n    $$f_1 = \\frac{C_1}{C_1 + K_d} = \\frac{0.07958}{0.07958 + 0.05} = \\frac{0.07958}{0.12958} \\approx 0.61414$$\n\n3.  **Calculate the guidance signal $A_1$.**\n    $$A_1 = f_1^2 \\approx (0.61414)^2 \\approx 0.37717$$\n    This value is approximately $0.38$.\n\n**Analysis of Change**\n\n- The guidance signal $A$ drops from $A_2 \\approx 0.58$ to $A_1 \\approx 0.38$.\n- The percentage reduction in the guidance signal is:\n$$\\frac{A_2 - A_1}{A_2} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{0.579 - 0.377}{0.579} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{0.202}{0.579} \\times 100\\% \\approx 34.9\\%$$\nThis implies an approximately $35\\%$ reduction in guidance accuracy.\n\n- Regarding tube reception, the problem explicitly states: \"If at least one synergid is present and competent, assume the probability of successful reception upon contact is high\". Therefore, the ablation of one synergid does not compromise the intrinsic ability of the remaining synergid to mediate tube reception for a pollen tube that successfully arrives.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The guidance signal $A$ drops from approximately $0.58$ (two synergids) to approximately $0.38$ (one synergid), implying an approximately $35\\%$ reduction in guidance accuracy; tube reception at the remaining synergid is largely unaffected for tubes that arrive, so fewer tubes reach the micropyle correctly, but those that do rupture normally.**\n- The quantitative part of this statement matches our calculations precisely ($A_2 \\approx 0.58$, $A_1 \\approx 0.38$, percent reduction $\\approx 35\\%$).\n- The qualitative part correctly concludes that a reduced guidance signal impairs arrival accuracy, and that reception at the single remaining synergid is unaffected, consistent with the problem's premises.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The guidance signal $A$ remains essentially unchanged due to saturating amplification, so guidance accuracy is unaffected; tube reception fails frequently because two synergids are jointly required to trigger FERONIA-dependent tube rupture.**\n- The signal $A$ decreases by $\\approx 35\\%$, which is a significant change, not \"essentially unchanged.\" The system is not fully saturated.\n- The premise that \"two synergids are jointly required\" for reception contradicts the problem statement that \"at least one synergid\" is sufficient.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The guidance signal $A$ decreases by exactly $50\\%$, and tube reception is also intrinsically impaired because total synergid-derived Rapid Alkalinization Factor (RALF) peptides are halved; thus both guidance and reception decrease to a similar extent.**\n- The signal $A$ decreases by $\\approx 35\\%$, not $50\\%$. The signal response is non-linear with respect to concentration.\n- The problem states that RALF peptides are \"male-derived,\" not \"synergid-derived.\" This statement contains a factual error regarding the origin of the ligand.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The guidance signal $A$ increases because reduced source competition prevents receptor desensitization, leading to improved guidance; reception is mildly enhanced because the remaining synergid receives less cross-talk from its partner.**\n- The signal $A$ demonstrably decreases, it does not increase. Removing an attractant source weakens the overall signal. The concepts of \"source competition\" and \"receptor desensitization\" are not part of the given model and are used here counter-intuitively.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2662920"}, {"introduction": "The final step in successful double fertilization involves the specific fusion of two distinct sperm cells with the egg and central cell, respectively. This capstone problem shifts your focus from quantitative modeling to the logic of experimental design, the bedrock of scientific discovery. You will critically evaluate a series of proposed experiments designed to distinguish between two competing hypotheses for this gamete pairing, sharpening your ability to formulate and test falsifiable predictions in developmental biology [@problem_id:2662978].", "problem": "A flowering plant undergoes double fertilization: a pollen tube delivers $2$ sperm cells into the embryo sac, where one sperm fuses with the egg cell to form the zygote and the other fuses with the central cell to form the endosperm. You are asked to reason from first principles of cell-cell recognition and developmental patterning to discriminate between two mechanistic hypotheses about how a particular sperm ends up fusing with the egg versus the central cell.\n\nFundamental basis you may use: in angiosperms, double fertilization involves $2$ sperm cells released near the egg apparatus; cell fusion generally requires specific ligand-receptor interactions between gamete membranes; spatial and temporal proximities can bias encounter rates and fusion opportunities in cell-cell interactions; altering receptor expression can alter binding specificity, whereas altering geometry affects encounter probabilities.\n\nConsider these two competing hypotheses for preferential pairing:\n- Hypothesis $H_R$ (receptor-based): the egg expresses a receptor $R_E$ that preferentially binds a sperm-surface ligand $L_A$ on sperm type $S_A$, while the central cell expresses a distinct receptor $R_C$ that preferentially binds ligand $L_B$ on sperm type $S_B$. Thus, molecular identity via differential receptor expression biases which sperm fuses with which female gamete.\n- Hypothesis $H_P$ (positional): after pollen tube discharge, the sperm positioned closer to the egg (or contacting it first) fuses with the egg, and the other fuses with the central cell; molecular identity of the sperm does not influence pairing beyond effects on position.\n\nYou have access to egg-specific and central cell-specific promoters, live imaging, and tools to manipulate protein expression and position. Which of the following observations are falsifiable predictions that would uniquely support $H_R$ over $H_P$ in properly controlled experiments? Select all that apply.\n\nA. Targeted knockout of $R_E$ specifically in the egg abolishes the prior bias of $S_A$ fusing with the egg, yielding random assignment of $S_A$ versus $S_B$ to egg versus central cell, with restoration of the bias upon egg-specific rescue of $R_E$.\n\nB.

It presents a standard biological scenario of double fertilization in angiosperms and posits two clear, competing, and falsifiable hypotheses to explain the specificity of gamete fusion. The first hypothesis, $H_R$, is based on molecular recognition via specific ligand-receptor interactions. The second, $H_P$, is based on positional information. The problem is scientifically grounded in developmental biology, well-posed, objective, and provides sufficient information to evaluate the proposed experimental outcomes. The described experimental tools and manipulations are standard concepts in modern biology for testing such hypotheses.\n\nThe objective is to identify which experimental observations would uniquely support the receptor-based hypothesis ($H_R$) over the positional hypothesis ($H_P$). An observation provides unique support for $H_R$ if it is a direct prediction of $H_R$ and, simultaneously, is inconsistent with or directly contradicts the predictions of $H_P$.\n\nHypothesis $H_R$ (Receptor-based): The fusion of a specific sperm ($S_A$) with the egg is mediated by a specific molecular interaction between a ligand $L_A$ on the sperm and a receptor $R_E$ on the egg. Fusion is thus determined by the molecular identity of the interacting cells.\n\nHypothesis $H_P$ (Positional): The fusion outcome is determined by the spatial position of the sperm cells upon release from the pollen tube. The sperm cell that is closer to the egg fuses with it, irrespective of the sperm's molecular identity.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option.\n\nA. Targeted knockout of $R_E$ specifically in the egg abolishes the prior bias of $S_A$ fusing with the egg, yielding random assignment of $S_A$ versus $S_B$ to egg versus central cell, with restoration of the bias upon egg-specific rescue of $R_E$.\n- Rationale: According to $H_R$, the receptor $R_E$ is the molecular basis for the egg's preference for sperm $S_A$. A loss-of-function experiment, such as a knockout of the gene for $R_E$, should eliminate this preference. The observed loss of bias is a direct prediction of $H_R$. The restoration of the bias upon reintroduction of $R_E$ (a rescue experiment) confirms that the observed effect is specifically due to the absence of $R_E$ and not an off-target effect. In contrast, $H_P$ posits that the mechanism is purely positional and does not depend on any specific receptor. Therefore, under $H_P$, knocking out $R_E$ should have no effect on the fusion bias. The observation directly contradicts $H_P$.\n- Verdict: **Correct**. This observation provides unique support for $H_R$.\n\nB. Ectopic expression of $R_E$ in the central cell (while retaining its normal expression in the egg) increases the frequency that $S_A$ fuses with the central cell instead of the egg.\n- Rationale: This is a gain-of-function experiment. According to $H_R$, expressing the receptor $R_E$ in a cell confers the ability to recognize and fuse with sperm $S_A$. If the central cell, which normally does not attract $S_A$, is engineered to express $R_E$, it should now be able to compete with the egg for sperm $S_A$. An increase in $S_A$ fusion with the central cell is a direct prediction of $H_R$. According to $H_P$, fusion is determined by position, not by receptors. The presence or absence of $R_E$ on the central cell is irrelevant. $H_P$ predicts no change in fusion outcomes. The observation thus contradicts $H_P$.\n- Verdict: **Correct**. This observation provides unique support for $H_R$.\n\nC. Immediately after sperm release, experimentally swapping the positions of $S_A$ and $S_B$ adjacent to the egg versus central cell (e.g., by gentle micromanipulation) does not change the identity bias: $S_A$ still preferentially fuses with the egg.\n- Rationale: This experiment directly pits the two hypotheses against each other. $H_P$ predicts that the identity of the sperm fusing with the egg depends only on its position. If the positions of $S_A$ and $S_B$ are swapped, then $H_P$ predicts that $S_B$ (now closer to the egg) should fuse with the egg. The observation that the outcome is unchanged (i.e., $S_A$ still fuses with the egg regardless of its new, more distant starting position) is a direct falsification of $H_P$. Conversely, $H_R$ predicts that molecular identity is the determinant, so even if $S_A$ has to travel slightly farther, its specific molecular affinity for the egg will dictate the fusion outcome.\n- Verdict: **Correct**. This observation provides unique support for $H_R$ by directly falsifying $H_P$.\n\nD. Disrupting synergid-secreted pollen tube attractants reduces or abolishes the identity bias of $S_A$ for the egg, without altering gamete receptor expression.\n- Rationale: Synergid-secreted attractants guide the pollen tube to the embryo sac. Disrupting this guidance system affects an upstream event: the delivery of the sperm cells. A precise delivery is critical for the positional mechanism of $H_P$; randomizing the pollen tube arrival point would randomize the initial positions of the sperm, thus abolishing the bias under $H_P$. A precise delivery is also a prerequisite for $H_R$ to function, as the sperm must be delivered in close enough proximity for ligand-receptor interactions to occur. If the sperm are released too far from the female gametes, fusion may become stochastic or fail entirely. Because a loss of bias is a plausible consequence under both hypotheses, this observation does not uniquely discriminate between them.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**. This observation fails to uniquely support $H_R$ over $H_P$.\n\nE. Observing that the egg and the central cell differentially express distinct receptor-like genes at the transcript level.\n- Rationale: This observation is a correlation, not a functional test. While $H_R$ requires the differential expression of receptors, observing such expression does not prove that these genes are functionally responsible for gamete fusion specificity. It is a necessary prerequisite for $H_R$, but it is not sufficient evidence to support it over $H_P$. The positional mechanism of $H_P$ could operate regardless of what genes are expressed. To establish causality, one must perform a functional experiment that manipulates the system (like in options A, B, C, F).\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**. This is correlational data and does not provide unique, functional support for $H_R$.\n\nF. Addition of a soluble, excess ectodomain of $R_E$ into the embryo sac fluid prior to sperm arrival competitively inhibits $S_A$–egg fusion, reducing the $S_A$ bias for the egg without affecting $S_B$–central cell fusion.\n- Rationale: This is a competitive inhibition experiment. According to $H_R$, fusion depends on the binding of ligand $L_A$ on sperm $S_A$ to the receptor $R_E$ on the egg's surface. A soluble form of the $R_E$ ectodomain (the part that binds the ligand) would act as a decoy, binding to $L_A$ on sperm $S_A$ and preventing it from binding to the egg. This would specifically inhibit $S_A$-egg fusion. The fact that $S_B$-central cell fusion is unaffected demonstrates the specificity of the inhibition, as this interaction relies on a different ligand-receptor pair ($L_B$-$R_C$). In contrast, $H_P$ posits a mechanism independent of such receptors, so the addition of a soluble protein should have no effect on the position-dependent outcome. The observation thus directly supports $H_R$ and contradicts $H_P$.\n- Verdict: **Correct**. This observation provides unique and specific support for $H_R$.\n\nIn summary, options A, B, C, and F describe outcomes of functional experiments that each provide unique support for the receptor-based hypothesis ($H_R$) by yielding results that are inexplicable or directly contradicted by the positional hypothesis ($H_P$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCF}$$", "id": "2662978"}]}
