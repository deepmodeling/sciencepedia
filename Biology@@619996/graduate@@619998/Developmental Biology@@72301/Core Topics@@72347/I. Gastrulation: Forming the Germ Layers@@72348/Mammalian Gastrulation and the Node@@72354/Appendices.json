A solution will be provided.\n\nThe starting point is the incompressible momentum balance for a Newtonian fluid, also known as the Navier-Stokes equation for an incompressible fluid:\n$$\n\\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v} \\right) = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{f}\n$$\nHere, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $\\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity vector field, $t$ is time, $p$ is the pressure, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, and $\\mathbf{f}$ represents body forces.\n\nThe problem states the flow is steady, which means all time derivatives are zero: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$. It also states to neglect body forces, so $\\mathbf{f} = \\mathbf{0}$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v} = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}\n$$\nThe term on the left, $\\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v}$, represents inertial effects (momentum advection), while the term $\\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}$ represents viscous effects (momentum diffusion).\n\nTo perform a scaling analysis, we introduce dimensionless variables, denoted with an asterisk ($*$). We define characteristic scales for the physical quantities: $U$ for speed and $L$ for length. The variables can be written as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v} = U \\mathbf{v}^*\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla = \\frac{1}{L} \\nabla^*\n$$\nSubstituting these into the simplified momentum equation:\n$$\n\\rho \\left( (U \\mathbf{v}^*) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{L} \\nabla^*\\right) \\right) (U \\mathbf{v}^*) = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\left(\\frac{1}{L^2} \\nabla^{*2}\\right) (U \\mathbf{v}^*)\n$$\nWe consolidate the constant coefficients for each term:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\rho U^2}{L} \\right) (\\mathbf{v}^* \\cdot \\nabla^*) \\mathbf{v}^* = -\\nabla p + \\left( \\frac{\\mu U}{L^2} \\right) \\nabla^{*2} \\mathbf{v}^*\n$$\nThe magnitudes of the dimensionless quantities ($\\mathbf{v}^*$, $\\nabla^*$, etc.) are of order one, $O(1)$. Therefore, the scale of the inertial term is $\\frac{\\rho U^2}{L}$, and the scale of the viscous term is $\\frac{\\mu U}{L^2}$.\n\nThe dimensionless ratio that compares inertial to viscous effects is the ratio of these characteristic scales:\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Scale of inertial effects}}{\\text{Scale of viscous effects}} = \\frac{\\rho U^2 / L}{\\mu U / L^2} = \\frac{\\rho U^2 L^2}{\\mu U L} = \\frac{\\rho U L}{\\mu}\n$$\nThis dimensionless group is the Reynolds number, denoted $Re$.\n$$\nRe = \\frac{\\rho U L}{\\mu}\n$$\n\nThe mathematical criterion that defines the low-inertia (creeping) regime is when inertial effects are negligible compared to viscous effects. This occurs when the Reynolds number is much less than one:\n$$\nRe \\ll 1\n$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate this ratio for the given representative parameters.

Since the parabola opens upward, this range is $r > r_{larger}$ or $r < r_{smaller}$. Given that we are interested in ratios $r > 0$ and the condition $ar+d > 0$ must also hold, the instability is achieved for $r$ greater than the larger root. The critical ratio $r_c$ is therefore the larger root, which corresponds to the '$+$' sign in the solution for $\\sqrt{r}$.\n$$\nr_c = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{ad-bc} + \\sqrt{-bc}}{a} \\right)^2\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the minimal diffusion ratio, completing Task $2$.\n\nFor Task $3$, we compute $Q = r_c - r_{\\text{obs}}$ using the given parameter values: $a = 0.06$, $b = -0.25$, $c = 0.40$, $d = -0.30$, and $r_{\\text{obs}} = 12$.\nFirst, calculate the intermediate quantities $\\Delta = ad-bc$ and $-bc$:\n$$\n\\Delta = (0.06)(-0.30) - (-0.25)(0.40) = -0.018 - (-0.10) = 0.082\n$$\n$$\n-bc = -(-0.25)(0.40) = 0.1\n$$\nNow, substitute these into the expression for $r_c$:\n$$\nr_c = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{0.082} + \\sqrt{0.1}}{0.06} \\right)^2\n$$\nNumerically evaluating the terms:\n$$\n\\sqrt{0.082} \\approx 0.286356\n$$\n$$\n\\sqrt{0.1} \\approx 0.316228\n$$\n$$\nr_c \\approx \\left( \\frac{0.286356 + 0.316228}{0.06} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{0.602584}{0.06} \\right)^2 \\approx (10.04307)^2 \\approx 100.8632\n$$\nFinally, we compute $Q$:\n$$\nQ = r_c - r_{\\text{obs}} \\approx 100.8632 - 12 = 88.8632\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested:\n$$\nQ \\approx 88.9\n$$\nThis completes Task $3$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{88.9}\n$$", "id": "2649470"}]}
