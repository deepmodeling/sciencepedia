By comparing the effects of the natural ligand Shh with a synthetic agonist, you will solidify your understanding of how PTCH1-mediated sterol transport controls SMO activation.", "problem": "A laboratory uses a Gli-dependent luciferase reporter cell line to dissect the logic of Hedgehog signal transduction starting from the following foundational facts. In vertebrates, the Hedgehog pathway is off when Patched 1 (PTCH1) suppresses Smoothened (SMO) by lowering the concentration of accessible membrane sterols in the vicinity of SMO. Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) binding to PTCH1 inhibits PTCH1 transporter activity, thereby allowing an increase in accessible sterols that license SMO activation. SMO has at least two sterol-interacting modules: a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) near the extracellular side that binds sterols and oxysterols, and a seven-transmembrane (7TM) pocket that can be engaged by both endogenous sterols and small-molecule agonists such as Smoothened Agonist (SAG). Activation of SMO leads to Gli transcription factor activation and a rise in Gli-luciferase readout.\n\nYou engineer a SMO variant whose CRD is specifically mutated to impair sterol binding, while leaving the 7TM ligand-binding pocket intact and trafficking-competent. In NIH 3T3 reporter cells expressing PTCH1, you compare responses to two ligands: Shh (which acts by binding and inhibiting PTCH1) and SAG (which directly binds the SMO 7TM pocket). You confirm equal surface and ciliary abundance of wild-type and mutant SMO at baseline.\n\nWhich prediction best captures the effect on pathway output in response to Shh versus SAG, and why, strictly reasoning from the mechanism in which PTCH1 limits SMO by depleting accessible sterols?\n\nA. Shh-induced Gli activation is markedly attenuated to near-baseline, whereas SAG elicits near–wild-type activation, because Shh relief of PTCH1 increases accessible sterols that normally engage the CRD; with CRD sterol binding impaired, this physiological route is blocked, but SAG bypasses PTCH1 by directly activating the intact 7TM pocket.\n\nB.

Shh causes hyperactivation relative to wild type, whereas SAG responses are reduced, because loss of CRD sterol binding prevents PTCH1 from depleting sterols and thereby constitutively primes SMO for Shh but not for SAG.", "solution": "The problem statement must first be subject to rigorous validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extraction of Givens**\n-   **System**: A Gli-dependent luciferase reporter cell line.\n-   **Baseline Mechanism (Pathway Off)**: Patched 1 (PTCH1) suppresses Smoothened (SMO) by reducing the concentration of accessible membrane sterols in the vicinity of SMO.\n-   **Activation Mechanism (Pathway On)**: Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) binds to PTCH1, inhibiting its transporter activity. This leads to an increase in accessible sterols, which licenses the activation of SMO.\n-   **SMO Domains**: SMO possesses two key sterol-interacting modules: (1) a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) that binds sterols and oxysterols, and (2) a seven-transmembrane (7TM) pocket that binds endogenous sterols and synthetic agonists like Smoothened Agonist (SAG).\n-   **Signal Transduction Output**: SMO activation promotes Gli transcription factor activation, measured by a Gli-luciferase reporter.\n-   **Experimental Perturbation**: A mutant SMO is created with a specific mutation in its CRD that impairs sterol binding. The 7TM pocket is explicitly stated to be intact and the protein is trafficking-competent.\n-   **Experimental Conditions**: Reporter cells expressing PTCH1 are treated with either Shh or SAG. The responses of cells with wild-type SMO are compared to those with the CRD-mutant SMO.\n-   **Experimental Control**: The surface and ciliary abundance of wild-type and mutant SMO are confirmed to be equal at baseline.\n-   **Objective**: Predict the signaling output (Gli-luciferase activity) in response to Shh versus SAG in cells expressing the CRD-mutant SMO. The reasoning must be based strictly on the provided mechanism.\n\n**Step 2: Validation of Problem Statement**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes the canonical vertebrate Hedgehog signaling pathway with a level of detail consistent with modern cell biology literature. The components (PTCH1, SMO, Shh, Gli), their interactions (inhibition, activation), the role of sterols as second messengers, and the domains of SMO (CRD, 7TM) are all established concepts. The experimental design—using a specific mutant and specific ligands (Shh, SAG) in a reporter cell line—is a standard and logical approach to dissecting pathway mechanisms. The problem is self-contained, providing a clear mechanism and asking for a prediction based on that mechanism alone. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. The problem is a valid test of logical deduction based on a given biological model.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe foundational principle for this problem is the mechanism of SMO activation. In the physiological context initiated by Shh, activation proceeds as follows: Shh → PTCH1 inhibition → increased local sterol concentration → SMO activation. The problem states that SMO has two sterol-interacting modules, the CRD and the 7TM pocket. The increase in accessible sterols, relieved from PTCH1-mediated suppression, is the activating signal that SMO must sense. The CRD is explicitly defined as a domain that \"binds sterols.\" The experimental perturbation is a mutation that specifically ablates the sterol-binding function of the CRD.\n\nLet us analyze the two signaling scenarios for the CRD-mutant SMO.\n\n1.  **Response to Shh**:\n    -   Shh is added, binding to and inhibiting PTCH1.\n    -   In accordance with the mechanism, the local concentration of accessible sterols around SMO increases.\n    -   In a wild-type cell, these sterols would engage SMO, with the CRD being a primary binding site as per its description. This binding event is a critical part of the activation sequence.\n    -   In the cell with the CRD-mutant SMO, the CRD is specifically unable to bind sterols. Therefore, the protein is unable to sense the increase in sterol concentration via this module. This effectively disconnects the upstream signal (increased sterols) from one of its key sensors on the SMO protein.\n    -   Consequently, the physiological activation of SMO in response to Shh must be severely impaired or \"attenuated.\" The signal cannot be transduced effectively if the receptor for that signal is broken.\n\n2.  **Response to SAG**:\n    -   SAG is a pharmacological agonist that acts directly on SMO. The problem states it engages the 7TM pocket.\n    -   This mode of activation bypasses the entire upstream cascade: it does not require Shh and is independent of PTCH1 activity and the concentration of endogenous sterols.\n    -   The problem specifies that the CRD mutation leaves the \"7TM ligand-binding pocket intact.\"\n    -   Therefore, SAG can still bind to its target site on the CRD-mutant SMO and induce a conformational change leading to activation.\n    -   The response to SAG, being a direct pharmacological activation of an intact domain, should be largely preserved and thus comparable to that of wild-type SMO.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation**: The prediction is a marked attenuation of the Shh response and a near-normal response to SAG.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Shh-induced Gli activation is markedly attenuated to near-baseline, whereas SAG elicits near–wild-type activation, because Shh relief of PTCH1 increases accessible sterols that normally engage the CRD; with CRD sterol binding impaired, this physiological route is blocked, but SAG bypasses PTCH1 by directly activating the intact 7TM pocket.**\n    This statement perfectly aligns with the logical derivation. It correctly identifies that the Shh pathway relies on sterols engaging the CRD, which is now non-functional in the mutant. It also correctly states that SAG bypasses this physiological route by directly engaging the intact 7TM pocket. The reasoning is sound and strictly follows from the provided premises.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Both Shh and SAG elicit near–wild-type activation, because the CRD is dispensable when the 7TM pocket is intact; PTCH1-mediated sterol depletion does not influence SMO conformation.**\n    This option is incorrect. It makes a claim, \"PTCH1-mediated sterol depletion does not influence SMO conformation,\" that directly contradicts the premise that \"PTCH1 suppresses SMO by lowering the concentration of accessible membrane sterols.\" Furthermore, to claim the CRD (a \"sterol-interacting module\") is \"dispensable\" for a process that is mediated by sterols is an unsubstantiated assertion that violates Occam's razor.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Shh elicits near–wild-type activation but SAG fails to activate, because PTCH1 relief primarily signals via the 7TM pocket, which becomes unresponsive without CRD sterol binding.**\n    This option posits the opposite outcome for both ligands. The reasoning introduces a new, unstated mechanism of allosteric coupling where the 7TM pocket becomes \"unresponsive without CRD sterol binding.\" There is no basis for this assumption in the problem description. The problem states the 7TM pocket is \"intact,\" which implies it is functional. This option relies on speculation beyond the provided facts.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Shh causes hyperactivation relative to wild type, whereas SAG responses are reduced, because loss of CRD sterol binding prevents PTCH1 from depleting sterols and thereby constitutively primes SMO for Shh but not for SAG.**\n    This option is fundamentally flawed. The mutation is in SMO, not PTCH1; there is no reason to believe a mutated SMO would prevent PTCH1 from performing its function. The idea that blocking a sensor for a signal would lead to hyperactivation upon stimulation is illogical. The prediction of reduced SAG response is also incorrect, as the SAG binding site is intact.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2681020"}, {"introduction": "Downstream of Smoothened, the Hedgehog signal is transduced through changes in cyclic AMP ($cAMP$) concentration within the primary cilium, which in turn modulates Protein Kinase A (PKA) activity.
