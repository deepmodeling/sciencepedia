Cell A expresses the receptor Notch with total surface density $N_0$ and also expresses the ligand Delta on its own membrane (cis) with surface density $D_C$.

It describes a standard, albeit simplified, model of cis-inhibition in the Notch-Delta signaling pathway, a fundamental concept in developmental biology. The assumptions provided—such as equilibrium conditions, the law of mass action, and constant ligand concentrations—are conventional for constructing a mean-field biophysical model of this type. The problem contains all necessary information ($N_0$, $D_C$, $D_T$, $K_D$) and a clear objective: to derive the fractional occupancy $\\theta_T$. The premises are not contradictory, and the terminology is precise. The question about the behavior at saturating trans-ligand is a critical test of the derived model's properties and is a standard method of analysis in receptor pharmacology. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A complete derivation will now be provided.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in the correct interpretation of the sequence of equilibria. The statement specifies that cis-binding is a \"rapid pre-equilibrium that partitions the Notch pool\". This phrasing dictates a hierarchical or sequential model. First, the rapid cis-interaction establishes an equilibrium that determines the fraction of Notch receptors available for any subsequent interactions. Second, this available subpool of receptors then equilibrates with the trans-ligands.\n\nLet us define the concentrations (surface densities) of the relevant species:\n- $N_0$ is the total surface density of Notch, a constant.\n- $[N_C]$ is the density of Notch bound in a cis-complex with $D_C$.\n- $[N_{avail}]$ is the density of Notch that is *not* bound in a cis-complex. This is the \"free subpool\" mentioned in the problem, which is available to bind trans-ligand.\n- $[N_T]$ is the density of Notch from the available pool that is bound in a trans-complex with $D_T$.\n- $[N_U]$ is the density of Notch that is \"unbound\", i.e., part of the available pool but not bound to trans-ligand.\n\nFirst, we analyze the rapid pre-equilibrium of cis-binding. The total Notch pool $N_0$ is partitioned between cis-bound Notch $[N_C]$ and available Notch $[N_{avail}]$.\nThe conservation equation for this step is:\n$$N_0 = [N_C] + [N_{avail}]$$\nThe equilibrium for cis-binding is governed by the dissociation constant $K_D$:\n$$K_D = \\frac{[N_{avail}] D_C}{[N_C]}$$\nFrom this equilibrium expression, we can express $[N_C]$ in terms of $[N_{avail}]$:\n$$[N_C] = \\frac{[N_{avail}] D_C}{K_D}$$\nSubstituting this into the conservation equation:\n$$N_0 = \\frac{[N_{avail}] D_C}{K_D} + [N_{avail}] = [N_{avail}] \\left( 1 + \\frac{D_C}{K_D} \\right) = [N_{avail}] \\left( \\frac{K_D + D_C}{K_D} \\right)$$\nSolving for the density of available Notch, $[N_{avail}]$, we find:\n$$[N_{avail}] = N_0 \\left( \\frac{K_D}{K_D + D_C} \\right)$$\nThis equation shows how cis-ligand $D_C$ sequesters Notch, reducing the pool available for trans-interaction. The fraction of total Notch that remains available is $\\frac{[N_{avail}]}{N_0} = \\frac{K_D}{K_D + D_C}$.\n\nNext, we analyze the equilibrium of trans-binding for the available Notch pool, $[N_{avail}]$. This pool partitions into unbound Notch, $[N_U]$, and trans-bound Notch, $[N_T]$.\nThe conservation equation for this second step is:\n$$[N_{avail}] = [N_U] + [N_T]$$\nThe equilibrium for trans-binding is governed by the same dissociation constant $K_D$:\n$$K_D = \\frac{[N_U] D_T}{[N_T]}$$\nFrom this, we express $[N_U]$ in terms of $[N_T]$:\n$$[N_U] = \\frac{[N_T] K_D}{D_T}$$\nSubstituting this into the conservation equation for the available pool:\n$$[N_{avail}] = \\frac{[N_T] K_D}{D_T} + [N_T] = [N_T] \\left( 1 + \\frac{K_D}{D_T} \\right) = [N_T] \\left( \\frac{D_T + K_D}{D_T} \\right)$$\nThe fraction of the *available* pool that becomes trans-bound is therefore:\n$$\\frac{[N_T]}{[N_{avail}]} = \\frac{D_T}{K_D + D_T}$$\nThis is a standard Langmuir binding isotherm, as expected.\n\nThe problem requires the total fractional occupancy of Notch in the trans-bound state, $\\theta_T$, which is defined as the ratio of trans-bound Notch to the *total* Notch pool, $N_0$:\n$$\\theta_T = \\frac{[N_T]}{N_0}$$\nWe can express this as the product of two fractions: the fraction of Notch that is available, and the fraction of the available pool that binds to trans-ligand.\n$$\\theta_T = \\frac{[N_{avail}]}{N_0} \\times \\frac{[N_T]}{[N_{avail}]}$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived in the previous steps:\n$$\\theta_T = \\left( \\frac{K_D}{K_D + D_C} \\right) \\left( \\frac{D_T}{K_D + D_T} \\right)$$\nThis simplifies to the final closed-form expression:\n$$\\theta_T = \\frac{K_D D_T}{(K_D + D_C)(K_D + D_T)}$$\n\nThe second part of the problem asks to explain the effect of high cis-ligand at saturating trans-ligand concentrations ($D_T \\to \\infty$). We must take the limit of our expression for $\\theta_T$ as $D_T$ becomes very large.\n$$\\lim_{D_T \\to \\infty} \\theta_T = \\lim_{D_T \\to \\infty} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{K_D}{K_D + D_C} \\right) \\left( \\frac{D_T}{K_D + D_T} \\right) \\right]$$\nThe first term is independent of $D_T$. The limit of the second term is:\n$$\\lim_{D_T \\to \\infty} \\frac{D_T}{K_D + D_T} = \\lim_{D_T \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_D}{D_T} + 1} = \\frac{1}{0 + 1} = 1$$\nTherefore, the maximum fractional occupancy at saturating trans-ligand is:\n$$\\theta_{T, \\text{max}} = \\lim_{D_T \\to \\infty} \\theta_T = \\frac{K_D}{K_D + D_C}$$\nThis result demonstrates why high cis-ligand concentration $D_C$ can still reduce trans-activation even when $D_T$ is saturating. The maximum achievable level of trans-activation, $\\theta_{T, \\text{max}}$, is not $1$, but is instead limited by the factor $\\frac{K_D}{K_D + D_C}$. As $D_C$ increases, this factor decreases. In the limit of very high cis-ligand ($D_C \\gg K_D$), $\\theta_{T, \\text{max}}$ approaches $0$. The physical reason for this is that cis-binding sequesters Notch receptors into a pool that is unavailable for trans-binding. Even an infinite concentration of trans-ligand cannot engage with receptors that have already been rendered incompetent by the rapid cis-interaction. The cis-ligand effectively reduces the total number of functional receptors available on the cell surface.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{K_D D_T}{(K_D + D_C)(K_D + D_T)}}$$", "id": "2682269"}, {"introduction": "The essence of lateral inhibition lies in a dynamic feedback loop between interacting cells, where an initial symmetry must be broken to generate distinct fates.

The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the conditions under which a spatially extended system, described by linearized dynamics, loses stability for a non-uniform spatial pattern while remaining stable for a uniform configuration. This phenomenon, known as a Turing-type or pattern-forming instability, is the mathematical basis for lateral inhibition.\n\nThe dynamics of the system for a given spatial mode, characterized by the eigenvalue $m$ of the neighbor-averaging operator, are governed by the $2 \\times 2$ linear system:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na \\\\\nd\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\nJ_m\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na \\\\\nd\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\quad \\text{where} \\quad\nJ_m =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-\\mu_a & t\\,m - s \\\\\n-\\,h & -\\mu_d\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe stability of the system for mode $m$ is determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix $J_m$. For a $2 \\times 2$ system, linear stability requires that both the trace of the matrix is negative and its determinant is positive. The system becomes unstable if the trace becomes positive (Hopf bifurcation) or if the determinant becomes negative (stationary or Turing-type bifurcation).\n\nLet us compute the trace and determinant of $J_m$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}(J_m) = -\\mu_a - \\mu_d\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Det}(J_m) = (-\\mu_a)(-\\mu_d) - (tm - s)(-h) = \\mu_a \\mu_d + h(tm - s)\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the relaxation rates $\\mu_a > 0$ and $\\mu_d > 0$. Consequently, the trace $\\mathrm{Tr}(J_m) = -(\\mu_a + \\mu_d)$ is always negative, regardless of the mode $m$ or other parameters. This precludes a Hopf bifurcation. Therefore, any instability must arise from the determinant becoming negative.\n\nThe conditions for stability and instability for a mode $m$ are thus simplified:\n- Mode $m$ is stable if $\\mathrm{Det}(J_m) > 0$.\n- Mode $m$ is unstable if $\\mathrm{Det}(J_m) < 0$.\n\nThe problem defines the criterion for a lateral inhibition pattern-forming instability as follows:\n1. The spatially uniform mode ($m=1$) must be stable.\n2. At least one non-uniform mode must be unstable. It is sufficient to check the most unstable mode on the hexagonal lattice, which is the anti-correlated or \"checkerboard\" pattern corresponding to $m_{\\min} = -\\tfrac{1}{2}$.\n\nApplying these two conditions, we derive the necessary and sufficient inequalities on the parameters.\n\nCondition $1$: Stability of the uniform mode, $m=1$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Det}(J_1) > 0 \\implies \\mu_a \\mu_d + h(t(1) - s) > 0 \\implies \\mu_a \\mu_d + h(t - s) > 0\n$$\n\nCondition $2$: Instability of the anti-correlated mode, $m = -\\tfrac{1}{2}$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Det}(J_{-1/2}) < 0 \\implies \\mu_a \\mu_d + h(t(-\\tfrac{1}{2}) - s) < 0 \\implies \\mu_a \\mu_d - \\frac{ht}{2} - hs < 0\n$$\n\nThese two inequalities together define the parameter space for lateral inhibition. To find the critical trans-binding strength $t_{\\mathrm{crit}}(s)$, we rearrange them to find the required range for $t$:\nFrom Condition $1$: $ht > hs - \\mu_a \\mu_d \\implies t > s - \\frac{\\mu_a \\mu_d}{h}$.\nFrom Condition $2$: $\\frac{ht}{2} > \\mu_a \\mu_d + hs \\implies t > \\frac{2\\mu_a \\mu_d}{h} + 2s$.\n\nFor a pattern to form, $t$ must satisfy both strict inequalities. Thus, $t$ must be greater than the maximum of the two lower bounds:\n$$\nt > \\max \\left( s - \\frac{\\mu_a \\mu_d}{h}, \\frac{2\\mu_a \\mu_d}{h} + 2s \\right)\n$$\nThe problem defines $t_{\\mathrm{crit}}(s)$ as the minimal value such that for all $t > t_{\\mathrm{crit}}(s)$, patterning occurs. This threshold is exactly the lower bound of the valid interval for $t$. Since the trans-binding strength $t$ must be non-negative ($t \\ge 0$), the critical threshold must also be non-negative. We therefore define $t_{\\mathrm{crit}}(s)$ as:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{crit}}(s) = \\max \\left( 0, s - \\frac{\\mu_a \\mu_d}{h}, \\frac{2\\mu_a \\mu_d}{h} + 2s \\right)\n$$\n\nFor the cis-null mutant, we set the cis-inhibition strength $s=0$. The critical threshold $t_{\\mathrm{crit}}(0)$ is then:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{crit}}(0) = \\max \\left( 0, -\\frac{\\mu_a \\mu_d}{h}, \\frac{2\\mu_a \\mu_d}{h} \\right)\n$$\nSince $\\mu_a, \\mu_d, h$ are all positive parameters, the term $-\\frac{\\mu_a \\mu_d}{h}$ is negative and $\\frac{2\\mu_a \\mu_d}{h}$ is positive. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{crit}}(0) = \\frac{2\\mu_a \\mu_d}{h}\n$$\n\nThe computational part of the task requires implementing these derived formulae. For each test case $(\\mu_a, \\mu_d, h, t, s)$:\n1.  `wild_type_pattern` is $1$ if the given $t$ satisfies $t > t_{\\mathrm{crit}}(s)$ for the given $s$, and $0$ otherwise.\n2.  `cis_null_pattern` is $1$ if the given $t$ satisfies $t > t_{\\mathrm{crit}}(0)$, and $0$ otherwise.\n3.  $t_{\\mathrm{crit}}(s)$ is calculated using its derived formula.\n4.  $t_{\\mathrm{crit}}(0)$ is calculated using its derived formula.\n\nThe following program implements these calculations for the provided test suite.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Notch-Delta lateral inhibition problem for a suite of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Test suite of parameter sets (mu_a, mu_d, h, t, s)\n    test_cases = [\n        (1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.8, 0.3),\n        (1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 0.9, 1.0),\n        (1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.1, 2.0),\n        (2.0, 2.0, 1.0, 6.0, 0.5),\n        (1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.2),\n        (0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 1.0, 0.4),\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n\n    for params in test_cases:\n        mu_a, mu_d, h, t, s = params\n\n        # Calculate common term\n        mu_prod_over_h = (mu_a * mu_d) / h\n\n        # 1.
