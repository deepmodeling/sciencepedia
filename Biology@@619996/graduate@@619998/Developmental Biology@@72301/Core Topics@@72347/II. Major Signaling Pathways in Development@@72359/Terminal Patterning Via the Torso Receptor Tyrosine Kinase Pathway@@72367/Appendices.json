This is a classic reaction-diffusion problem.\n\nLet $C(x, t)$ be the concentration of dpERK at position $x$ and time $t$. The dynamics of this system are described by the reaction-diffusion equation. The change in concentration over time, $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t}$, is the sum of contributions from diffusion and reaction.\n\nThe principle of mass conservation in one dimension is stated by the continuity equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nwhere $J(x, t)$ is the flux of the substance. According to Fick's first law of diffusion, the flux is proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient:\n$$\nJ = -D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. Substituting Fick's law into the continuity equation gives the diffusion term:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t}\\bigg|_{\\text{diffusion}} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThe problem states that dpERK is dephosphorylated (removed) by first-order kinetics with a rate constant $k$.

In steady state, the concentration at any given point does not change over time, which mathematically means $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = 0$. The partial differential equation thus simplifies to an ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n0 = D \\frac{d^2 C}{d x^2} - k C(x)\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 C}{d x^2} - \\frac{k}{D} C(x) = 0\n$$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients. The general solution is of the form $C(x) = c_1 \\exp(rx) + c_2 \\exp(-rx)$, where $r^2 = k/D$. The roots are $r = \\pm\\sqrt{k/D}$. Therefore, the general solution is:\n$$\nC(x) = c_1 \\exp\\left(x\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right) + c_2 \\exp\\left(-x\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)\n$$\nTo determine the constants $c_1$ and $c_2$, we must apply the boundary conditions of the system. The domain is specified as $x \\ge 0$.\nFirst, for physical realism, the concentration cannot become infinite at large distances from the source. As $x \\to \\infty$, the term $\\exp\\left(x\\sqrt{k/D}\\right)$ grows without bound. To ensure a finite concentration, its coefficient must be zero. Thus, we set $c_1 = 0$. The solution is now reduced to:\n$$\nC(x) = c_2 \\exp\\left(-x\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)\n$$\nSecond, at the pole ($x=0$), there is a localized source that maintains a peak concentration of dpERK. We denote this maximum concentration at the source as $C_0$. So, the boundary condition is $C(0) = C_0$. Applying this:\n$$\nC(0) = c_2 \\exp(0) = c_2 = C_0\n$$\nSubstituting $c_2 = C_0$, we obtain the final steady-state spatial profile:\n$$\nC(x) = C_0 \\exp\\left(-x\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is an exponential decay function. Such functions are often written in the form $C(x) = C_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, where $\\lambda$ is the characteristic decay length. By comparing our derived profile to this standard form, we identify the characteristic decay length as:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}}\n$$\nThe problem requires us to find the number of nuclear diameters over which the dpERK concentration remains above $e^{-1}$ of its peak value.

The gain is maximal when the output $f(E)$ is one-half. This occurs, by definition, when the input $E$ is equal to the midpoint constant $K$.\nThe region of maximal sensitivity is therefore centered at $E = K = 0.3$.\n\nFinally, we compute the value of the maximal gain, $G_{\\max}$, by substituting $f = \\frac{1}{2}$ into the expression for $G(f)$:\n$$ G_{\\max} = n \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = n \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{n}{4} $$\nThis is a general result for any system described by a Hill function where gain is defined as specified.
