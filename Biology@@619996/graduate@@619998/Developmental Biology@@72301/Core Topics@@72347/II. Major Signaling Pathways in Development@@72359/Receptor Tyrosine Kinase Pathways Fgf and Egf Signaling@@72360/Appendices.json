Receptors are synthesized and delivered to the plasma membrane at a constant rate $s$ (units: molecules per unit time). Receptors are internalized from the plasma membrane to the early endosome with rate constant $k_{i}$, recycled directly from the early endosome to the plasma membrane with rate constant $k_{f}$ (fast recycling), sorted from the early endosome to the recycling endosome with rate constant $k_{s}$, recycled from the recycling endosome to the plasma membrane with rate constant $k_{r}$ (slow recycling), and sent from the early endosome to the lysosome with rate constant $k_{\\ell}$.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. There are no identifiable flaws. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing receptor trafficking and the subsequent calculation of the steady-state receptor abundance in the plasma membrane, $M^{*}$. The derivation is based on the principle of mass-balance for each compartment. For any given compartment, the rate of change of the number of receptors is the sum of all influx rates minus the sum of all outflux rates. All fluxes are assumed to follow first-order mass-action kinetics.\n\nLet us define the change in receptor number for each compartment.\n\n1.  **Plasma Membrane, $M(t)$**:\n    - Influxes:\n        - Synthesis and delivery: a constant rate $s$.\n        - Fast recycling from the early endosome: rate $k_{f} E(t)$.\n        - Slow recycling from the recycling endosome: rate $k_{r} R(t)$.\n    - Outflux:\n        - Internalization into the early endosome: rate $k_{i} M(t)$.\n    The mass-balance equation for the plasma membrane is:\n    $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}M}{\\mathrm{d}t} = s + k_{f} E(t) + k_{r} R(t) - k_{i} M(t) $$\n\n2.  **Early Endosome, $E(t)$**:\n    - Influx:\n        - Internalization from the plasma membrane: rate $k_{i} M(t)$.\n    - Outfluxes:\n        - Fast recycling to the plasma membrane: rate $k_{f} E(t)$.\n        - Sorting to the recycling endosome: rate $k_{s} E(t)$.\n        - Sorting to the lysosome for degradation: rate $k_{\\ell} E(t)$.\n    The mass-balance equation for the early endosome is:\n    $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}E}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_{i} M(t) - (k_{f} + k_{s} + k_{\\ell}) E(t) $$\n\n3.  **Recycling Endosome, $R(t)$**:\n    - Influx:\n        - Sorting from the early endosome: rate $k_{s} E(t)$.\n    - Outflux:\n        - Slow recycling to the plasma membrane: rate $k_{r} R(t)$.\n    The mass-balance equation for the recycling endosome is:\n    $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}R}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_{s} E(t) - k_{r} R(t) $$\n\n4.  **Lysosome, $L(t)$**:\n    - Influx:\n        - Sorting from the early endosome: rate $k_{\\ell} E(t)$.\n    - Outflux:\n        - Degradation: rate $k_{b} L(t)$.\n    The mass-balance equation for the lysosome is:\n    $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}L}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_{\\ell} E(t) - k_{b} L(t) $$\n\nThis completes the first part of the problem. We have derived the system of four coupled linear first-order ordinary differential equations.\n\nNow, we must find the steady-state solution. At steady state, the number of receptors in each compartment is constant. Therefore, all time derivatives are equal to zero. Let $M^{*}$, $E^{*}$, $R^{*}$, and $L^{*}$ denote the steady-state abundances.\n\nThe system of equations becomes:\n1.  $0 = s + k_{f} E^{*} + k_{r} R^{*} - k_{i} M^{*}$\n2.  $0 = k_{i} M^{*} - (k_{f} + k_{s} + k_{\\ell}) E^{*}$\n3.  $0 = k_{s} E^{*} - k_{r} R^{*}$\n4.  $0 = k_{\\ell} E^{*} - k_{b} L^{*}$\n\nA fundamental principle of such a system at steady state is the conservation of total flux. The only source of new receptors for the entire system is synthesis, at rate $s$. The only sink, or point of irreversible removal, is degradation in the lysosome, at rate $k_{b} L(t)$. For the total number of receptors in the system to remain constant, the rate of synthesis must exactly balance the rate of degradation.\nThus, at steady state:\n$$ s = k_{b} L^{*} $$\nThis provides a crucial constraint.\n\nFrom the steady-state equation for the lysosome (equation 4), we have:\n$$ k_{\\ell} E^{*} = k_{b} L^{*} $$\nBy substituting $s$ for $k_{b} L^{*}$, we obtain a direct relationship between the synthesis rate and the steady-state abundance in the early endosome:\n$$ s = k_{\\ell} E^{*} $$\nFrom this, we can express $E^{*}$ in terms of known parameters:\n$$ E^{*} = \\frac{s}{k_{\\ell}} $$\n\nThe problem asks for an expression for $M^{*}$. We can use the steady-state equation for the early endosome (equation 2) to find this.\n$$ k_{i} M^{*} = (k_{f} + k_{s} + k_{\\ell}) E^{*} $$\nSolving for $M^{*}$ yields:\n$$ M^{*} = \\frac{k_{f} + k_{s} + k_{\\ell}}{k_{i}} E^{*} $$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $E^{*}$ we just derived:\n$$ M^{*} = \\frac{k_{f} + k_{s} + k_{\\ell}}{k_{i}} \\left( \\frac{s}{k_{\\ell}} \\right) $$\nThis expression can be rearranged into a final closed form.\n$$ M^{*} = s \\frac{k_{f} + k_{s} + k_{\\ell}}{k_{i} k_{\\ell}} $$\nThis result for $M^{*}$ is expressed solely in terms of the parameters specified in the problem statement: $s$, $k_{i}$, $k_{f}$, $k_{s}$, and $k_{\\ell}$. The parameters $k_{r}$ and $k_{b}$, while necessary for a full description of the system, are not required for the final expression for $M^{*}$, as they are eliminated through the application of the steady-state conservation principle.
