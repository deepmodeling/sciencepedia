From first principles of transcriptional regulation consistent with the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology (Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) to messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) to protein), we assume the following minimal, well-tested principles: transcription factors bind DNA at enhancers, activators increase transcription rate, repressors decrease it, and in a coarse-grained description the net transcriptional input can be approximated by an additive score that is compared to a threshold to determine whether transcription proceeds.\n\nConsider a schematic embryo of length normalized to the interval $[0,100]$ (arbitrary units of percent egg length), partitioned into $14$ equal, contiguous windows $W_1, W_2, \\ldots, W_{14}$ from anterior ($W_1$) to posterior ($W_{14}$). Four gap regulators are provided: two activators $A_1$ and $A_2$, and two repressors $R_1$ and $R_2$. Each regulator is either HIGH ($1$) or LOW ($0$) within a window. The HIGH windows for each regulator are:\n- $A_1$: $W_2, W_6, W_{10}, W_{14}$.\n- $A_2$: $W_4, W_8, W_{12}$.\n- $R_1$: $W_1, W_5, W_9, W_{13}$.\n- $R_2$: $W_3, W_7, W_{11}$.\n\nAll other windows for a given regulator are LOW.

None of these indices are consecutive. For example, window $W_3$ lies between $W_2$ and $W_4$, and the gene is OFF in $W_3$. Therefore, each ON window is an isolated window.

We can achieve this by first isolating the exponential terms and then dividing one equation by the other.\nFrom (1):\n$$\n\\exp(-s \\Delta x) = \\frac{2 \\kappa_{EF}}{\\beta_{E} I_{0}}\n$$\nFrom (2):\n$$\n\\exp(s \\Delta x) = \\frac{2 \\kappa_{FE}}{\\beta_{F} I_{0}}\n$$\nDividing the second expression by the first yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\exp(s \\Delta x)}{\\exp(-s \\Delta x)} = \\frac{2 \\kappa_{FE} / (\\beta_{F} I_{0})}{2 \\kappa_{EF} / (\\beta_{E} I_{0})}\n$$\nThe terms $2$ and $I_{0}$ cancel, leading to:\n$$\n\\exp(s \\Delta x - (-s \\Delta x)) = \\frac{\\kappa_{FE} \\beta_{E}}{\\kappa_{EF} \\beta_{F}}\n$$\n$$\n\\exp(2s \\Delta x) = \\frac{\\kappa_{FE} \\beta_{E}}{\\kappa_{EF} \\beta_{F}}\n$$\nTo solve for $\\Delta x$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\exp(2s \\Delta x)\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\kappa_{FE} \\beta_{E}}{\\kappa_{EF} \\beta_{F}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n2s \\Delta x = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\kappa_{FE} \\beta_{E}}{\\kappa_{EF} \\beta_{F}}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, isolating $\\Delta x$ provides the closed-form expression for the positional shift:\n$$\n\\Delta x = \\frac{1}{2s} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\kappa_{FE} \\beta_{E}}{\\kappa_{EF} \\beta_{F}}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression gives the displacement of the Eve-Ftz boundary relative to the crossing point of their activators. The sign of $\\Delta x$ is determined by the argument of the logarithm, which represents the balance of repressive strengths between the two genes. A positive $\\Delta x$ (posterior shift) occurs if the term $\\frac{\\kappa_{FE} \\beta_{E}}{\\kappa_{EF} \\beta_{F}}$ is greater than $1$, indicating that the Eve-to-Ftz repression is effectively stronger than the Ftz-to-Eve repression, thus pushing the boundary into the region initially favored by Ftz.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2s} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\kappa_{FE} \\beta_{E}}{\\kappa_{EF} \\beta_{F}}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2660420"}]}
