It provides a complete set of parameters and constraints to formally model the cooperative binding of two transcription factors, Ubx and Exd, to an enhancer. The problem is a standard application of statistical mechanics to molecular biology, specifically using the thermodynamic model of gene regulation. It is a valid problem.\n\nWe begin by defining the system. The enhancer has two binding sites, one for Ubx ($U$) and one for Exd ($E$). This leads to four possible microscopic states of the enhancer:\n$1$. Both sites are empty (state $00$).\n$2$. The Ubx site is occupied, and the Exd site is empty (state $10$).\n$3$. The Ubx site is empty, and the Exd site is occupied (state $01$).\n$4$. Both sites are occupied (state $11$).\n\nAccording to the principles of statistical mechanics, the probability of finding the system in a particular state is proportional to its statistical weight. We define the statistical weight of the empty state (state $00$) as $1$. The weights of the other states are determined relative to this reference state, based on the concentrations of the proteins and their binding affinities.\n\nThe dissociation constant for Ubx binding to its site when the Exd site is empty is $K_U$. The corresponding binding reaction is $U + \\text{Enhancer}_{0E} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Enhancer}_{UE}$. From the law of mass action at equilibrium, $K_U = \\frac{[U][\\text{Enhancer}_{0E}]}{[\\text{Enhancer}_{UE}]}$. The ratio of occupied to unoccupied states is $\\frac{[\\text{Enhancer}_{UE}]}{[\\text{Enhancer}_{0E}]} = \\frac{[U]}{K_U}$. Thus, the statistical weight of state $10$ is:\n$$W_{10} = \\frac{[U]}{K_U}$$\n\nSimilarly, for Exd binding to its site when the Ubx site is empty, the dissociation constant is $K_E$. The statistical weight of state $01$ is:\n$$W_{01} = \\frac{[E]}{K_E}$$\n\nFor the doubly-bound state (state $11$), we must account for the cooperativity, $\\omega$. The statistical weight is the product of the individual binding weights, scaled by this factor. The binding of one protein modifies the free energy, and thus the affinity, of the second protein's binding. The statistical weight of state $11$ is:\n$$W_{11} = \\omega \\left(\\frac{[U]}{K_U}\\right) \\left(\\frac{[E]}{K_E}\\right)$$\nHere, $\\omega > 1$ represents positive cooperativity (the binding of one factor facilitates the binding of the other), and $0 < \\omega < 1$ represents negative cooperativity.\n\nThe partition function, $Z$, is the sum of the statistical weights of all possible states. It serves as the normalization factor for calculating probabilities.\n$$Z = W_{00} + W_{10} + W_{01} + W_{11}$$\n$$Z = 1 + \\frac{[U]}{K_U} + \\frac{[E]}{K_E} + \\omega \\frac{[U]}{K_U} \\frac{[E]}{K_E}$$\n\nThe problem states that enhancer activation requires the simultaneous occupancy of both sites. Therefore, the probability of activation, which we denote as the dose-response $P_{\\text{act}}$, is the probability of the system being in state $11$. This is given by the statistical weight of state $11$ divided by the partition function $Z$:\n$$P_{\\text{act}}([U]) = \\frac{W_{11}}{Z} = \\frac{\\omega \\frac{[U]}{K_U} \\frac{[E]}{K_E}}{1 + \\frac{[U]}{K_U} + \\frac{[E]}{K_E} + \\omega \\frac{[U]}{K_U} \\frac{[E]}{K_E}}$$\n\nNext, we must determine the maximal activation, $P_{\\text{max}}$, which is the limit of $P_{\\text{act}}$ as the Ubx concentration $[U]$ approaches infinity, while the Exd concentration $[E]$ remains fixed.\n$$P_{\\text{max}} = \\lim_{[U] \\to \\infty} P_{\\text{act}}([U]) = \\lim_{[U] \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\omega \\frac{[U]}{K_U} \\frac{[E]}{K_E}}{1 + \\frac{[U]}{K_U} + \\frac{[E]}{K_E} + \\omega \\frac{[U]}{K_U} \\frac{[E]}{K_E}}$$\nTo evaluate this limit, we divide the numerator and the denominator by $[U]$:\n$$P_{\\text{max}} = \\lim_{[U] \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\omega \\frac{1}{K_U} \\frac{[E]}{K_E}}{\\frac{1}{[U]} + \\frac{1}{K_U} + \\frac{[E]}{[U]K_E} + \\omega \\frac{1}{K_U} \\frac{[E]}{K_E}}$$\nAs $[U] \\to \\infty$, terms with $\\frac{1}{[U]}$ vanish.\n$$P_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{\\omega \\frac{1}{K_U} \\frac{[E]}{K_E}}{\\frac{1}{K_U} + \\omega \\frac{1}{K_U} \\frac{[E]}{K_E}} = \\frac{\\omega \\frac{[E]}{K_E}}{1 + \\omega \\frac{[E]}{K_E}}$$\n\nThe quantity to be determined, $[U]_{1/2}$, is the concentration of Ubx that yields half-maximal activation.

Consider a simplified model of Ubx-dependent activation of haltere-specific target genes in which each cell’s Ubx concentration is a random variable reflecting stochastic gene expression around a tissue-wide mean. Assume the following foundations rooted in standard gene regulation and gene expression noise: (i) activation of a target occurs if and only if the Ubx concentration in a cell is at or above a fixed threshold, (ii) cell-to-cell fluctuations in Ubx concentration around a given mean are approximately Gaussian with a fixed coefficient of variation across genotypes, reflecting multiplicative noise from transcription and translation.\n\nLet the wild-type posterior haltere imaginal disc have a mean Ubx concentration of $\\mu_{\\mathrm{wt}} = 100$ arbitrary units, with a coefficient of variation $c_{v} = 0.20$.

The relationship between these parameters is given as $\\sigma = c_v \\mu$, where the coefficient of variation is $c_v = 0.20$.\n\nFirst, we establish the parameters for the wild-type condition. The mean concentration is given as $\\mu_{\\mathrm{wt}} = 100$. The standard deviation for the wild type is therefore:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{wt}} = c_v \\mu_{\\mathrm{wt}} = 0.20 \\times 100 = 20 $$\nSo, for the wild-type population of cells, the Ubx concentration follows the distribution $X_{\\mathrm{wt}} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(100, 20^2)$.\n\nNext, we determine the parameters for the hypomorphic condition.

The fact that a significant fraction of cells in the developing haltere disc has sub-threshold levels of Ubx is consistent with a partial transformation of the haltere into a wing. The tissue becomes a mosaic of cells with either haltere or wing identity, leading to the characteristic \"haltere-to-wing\" transformation phenotype observed in such mutants.
