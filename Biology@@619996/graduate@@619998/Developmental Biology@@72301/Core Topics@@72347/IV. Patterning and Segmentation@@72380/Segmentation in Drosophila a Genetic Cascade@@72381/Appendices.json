The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains no logical or factual flaws.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with a full derivation and analysis.\n\n### Derivation of Boundary Position and Sharpness\n\nFirst, we will derive an expression for the mid-boundary position, $x_{1/2}$. By definition, at $x=x_{1/2}$, the promoter occupancy is $P_{\\text{bound}} = 0.5$.\n$$ P_{\\text{bound}}(x_{1/2}) = \\frac{(B(x_{1/2})/K)^{n}}{1+(B(x_{1/2})/K)^{n}} = 0.5 $$\nMultiplying both sides by $2 \\cdot (1+(B(x_{1/2})/K)^{n})$ gives:\n$$ 2(B(x_{1/2})/K)^{n} = 1+(B(x_{1/2})/K)^{n} $$\n$$ (B(x_{1/2})/K)^{n} = 1 $$\nSince concentrations $B$ and $K$ are positive, the only real solution is:\n$$ B(x_{1/2})/K = 1 \\implies B(x_{1/2}) = K $$\nThis result shows that the concentration of Bicoid required to achieve half-maximal promoter occupancy is equal to the effective dissociation constant $K$, and this is independent of the Hill coefficient $n$.\n\nNow, we use the given concentration profile $B(x) = B_{0} e^{-x/\\lambda}$ to find the position $x_{1/2}$:\n$$ B_0 e^{-x_{1/2}/\\lambda} = K $$\n$$ e^{-x_{1/2}/\\lambda} = \\frac{K}{B_0} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -\\frac{x_{1/2}}{\\lambda} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{K}{B_0}\\right) = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{B_0}{K}\\right) $$\n$$ x_{1/2} = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{B_0}{K}\\right) $$\nThis expression for $x_{1/2}$ depends on $B_0$, $K$, and $\\lambda$, but it is explicitly **independent of the Hill coefficient $n$**.\n\nNext, we derive the boundary sharpness, $w_{10\\text{–}90}$. This is defined as $x_{0.1} - x_{0.9}$, where $x_p$ is the position at which $P_{\\text{bound}} = p$. We begin by finding a general expression for $x$ as a function of $P_{\\text{bound}} = p$.\n$$ p = \\frac{(B(x)/K)^{n}}{1+(B(x)/K)^{n}} \\implies p(1+(B(x)/K)^{n}) = (B(x)/K)^{n} $$\n$$ p = (1-p)(B(x)/K)^{n} \\implies \\frac{p}{1-p} = (B(x)/K)^{n} $$\nSolving for $B(x)$:\n$$ B(x) = K \\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right)^{1/n} $$\nNow we substitute the expression for the Bicoid gradient:\n$$ B_0 e^{-x/\\lambda} = K \\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right)^{1/n} $$\n$$ e^{-x/\\lambda} = \\frac{K}{B_0} \\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right)^{1/n} $$\n$$ -\\frac{x}{\\lambda} = \\ln\\left[\\frac{K}{B_0} \\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right)^{1/n}\\right] = \\ln\\left(\\frac{K}{B_0}\\right) + \\frac{1}{n}\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right) $$\n$$ x(p) = -\\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{K}{B_0}\\right) - \\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right) = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{B_0}{K}\\right) - \\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right) $$\nWe calculate $x_{0.9}$ (for $p=0.9$) and $x_{0.1}$ (for $p=0.1$):\n$$ x_{0.9} = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{B_0}{K}\\right) - \\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\ln\\left(\\frac{0.9}{0.1}\\right) = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{B_0}{K}\\right) - \\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\ln(9) $$\n$$ x_{0.1} = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{B_0}{K}\\right) - \\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\ln\\left(\\frac{0.1}{0.9}\\right) = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{B_0}{K}\\right) - \\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right) = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{B_0}{K}\\right) + \\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\ln(9) $$\nThe width $w_{10\\text{–}90}$ is the difference $x_{0.1} - x_{0.9}$ (since $x_{0.1} > x_{0.9}$):\n$$ w_{10\\text{–}90} = x_{0.1} - x_{0.9} = \\left(\\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{B_0}{K}\\right) + \\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\ln(9)\\right) - \\left(\\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{B_0}{K}\\right) - \\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\ln(9)\\right) $$\n$$ w_{10\\text{–}90} = \\frac{2\\lambda\\ln(9)}{n} $$\nThis expression shows that the boundary width is inversely proportional to $n$ and directly proportional to $\\lambda$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For fixed $B_{0}$, $K$, and $\\lambda$, the mid-boundary position satisfies $x_{1/2}=\\lambda \\ln(B_{0}/K)$ and is independent of $n$, while the 10%–90% width is $w_{10\\text{–}90}=\\dfrac{2\\,\\lambda\\,\\ln 9}{n}$, so increasing $n$ sharpens the boundary without shifting its midpoint.**\n- Our derivation yielded $x_{1/2} = \\lambda \\ln(B_0/K)$, which is independent of $n$. This part is correct.\n- Our derivation yielded $w_{10\\text{–}90} = \\frac{2\\lambda\\ln(9)}{n}$. This part is correct.\n- The conclusion that increasing $n$ sharpens the boundary (i.e., decreases $w_{10\\text{–}90}$) without shifting its midpoint ($x_{1/2}$) is a direct consequence of these two formulas.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Increasing $n$ shifts $x_{1/2}$ anteriorly because stronger cooperativity requires higher Bicoid concentration to reach $P_{\\text{bound}}=0.5$.**\n- Our derivation shows $x_{1/2}$ is independent of $n$. The statement that it shifts is false.\n- The reasoning is also false. The concentration required to reach $P_{\\text{bound}}=0.5$ is always $B=K$, irrespective of the value of $n$. Stronger cooperativity does not change the half-saturation point, it only steepens the response around it.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The spatial slope at mid-boundary obeys $\\left.\\dfrac{dP_{\\text{bound}}}{dx}\\right|_{x_{1/2}}=-\\dfrac{n}{4\\lambda}$, indicating that the boundary steepens linearly with $n$ and inversely with $\\lambda$.**\n- We compute the slope $\\frac{dP_{\\text{bound}}}{dx}$ using the chain rule: $\\frac{dP_{\\text{bound}}}{dx} = \\frac{dP_{\\text{bound}}}{dB} \\cdot \\frac{dB}{dx}$.\n- First, $\\frac{dB}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}(B_0 e^{-x/\\lambda}) = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} B_0 e^{-x/\\lambda} = -\\frac{B(x)}{\\lambda}$.\n- Second, $\\frac{dP_{\\text{bound}}}{dB} = \\frac{d}{dB}\\left(\\frac{(B/K)^n}{1+(B/K)^n}\\right)$. Let $y = B/K$. Then $\\frac{dy}{dB} = 1/K$.\n$$ \\frac{dP_{\\text{bound}}}{dy} = \\frac{n y^{n-1}(1+y^n) - y^n(n y^{n-1})}{(1+y^n)^2} = \\frac{n y^{n-1}}{(1+y^n)^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{dP_{\\text{bound}}}{dB} = \\frac{dP_{\\text{bound}}}{dy} \\frac{dy}{dB} = \\frac{n (B/K)^{n-1}}{(1+(B/K)^n)^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{K} $$\n- Combining them: $\\frac{dP_{\\text{bound}}}{dx} = \\left(\\frac{n (B/K)^{n-1}}{K(1+(B/K)^n)^2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{B}{\\lambda}\\right) = -\\frac{n}{\\lambda} \\frac{(B/K)^n}{(1+(B/K)^n)^2}$.\n- We evaluate this at $x=x_{1/2}$, where $B=K$.\n$$ \\left.\\frac{dP_{\\text{bound}}}{dx}\\right|_{x_{1/2}} = -\\frac{n}{\\lambda} \\frac{(K/K)^n}{(1+(K/K)^n)^2} = -\\frac{n}{\\lambda} \\frac{1^n}{(1+1^n)^2} = -\\frac{n}{\\lambda} \\frac{1}{(2)^2} = -\\frac{n}{4\\lambda} $$\n- The derived slope is correct. The magnitude of the slope is $|-n/(4\\lambda)| = n/(4\\lambda)$, which increases linearly with $n$ and is inversely proportional to $\\lambda$. The statement's interpretation is therefore correct. \"Steepens\" refers to the magnitude of the slope.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. For any $\\lambda$ and $K$, the 10%–90% width is independent of $\\lambda$ and depends only on $n$, so increasing the decay length cannot blur the boundary.**\n- Our derivation for the width is $w_{10\\text{–}90} = \\frac{2\\lambda\\ln(9)}{n}$.\n- This expression is directly proportional to $\\lambda$. The statement that it is independent of $\\lambda$ is false.\n- Consequently, the conclusion that increasing $\\lambda$ cannot blur the boundary is also false. Increasing $\\lambda$ increases the width $w_{10\\text{–}90}$, which corresponds to a \"blurrier\" or less sharp boundary.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2670441"}, {"introduction": "Gene expression patterns are rarely controlled by a single input; instead, enhancers act as sophisticated computational modules, integrating information from multiple transcription factors.

Assume the following fundamental bases and conditions:\n\n- Transcription factor binding to DNA is governed by equilibrium binding, and single- or multi-site occupancy can be summarized by a Hill-type input-output for each factor individually: the marginal probability of Bcd-site occupancy is $p_B([B])$, and the marginal probability of Hb-site occupancy is $p_H([H])$, with Hill coefficients $n_B$ and $n_H$, respectively. \n- Binding of Bcd and Hb occurs on distinct sites and is independent in the absence of direct physical cooperativity between the factors.\n- On the time scale of small, fast fluctuations in Bcd concentration, Hb concentration is quasi-static, so $p_H$ can be treated as a constant with respect to $[B]$.\n- At an anterior position $x^\\*$ near the expression boundary of interest, measurements indicate $p_B = 0.5$ and $p_H = 0.8$ for the relevant sites on both enhancers.\n- Define the enhancer output as the probability of the enhancer being in the transcriptionally active state.

The problem poses a clear question that can be answered by applying principles of probability and differential calculus to the provided definitions. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or missing information that would prevent a rigorous derivation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\n**1. Baseline Enhancer Outputs**\nThe problem defines enhancer output as the probability of its active state. Given that Bcd and Hb binding events are independent, with probabilities $p_B$ and $p_H$ respectively, we can formulate the output functions.\n\nFor the AND-like enhancer X, activity requires both factors to be bound. The probability of this joint event is:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{AND}} = p_B \\cdot p_H$$\n\nFor the OR-like enhancer Y, activity requires at least one factor to be bound. The probability of this event is given by the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{OR}} = p_B + p_H - p_B \\cdot p_H$$\n\nAt the specified position $x^\\*$, we are given $p_B = 0.5$ and $p_H = 0.8$. We can calculate the baseline outputs:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{AND}} = (0.5)(0.8) = 0.4$$\n$$f_{\\mathrm{OR}} = 0.5 + 0.8 - (0.5)(0.8) = 1.3 - 0.4 = 0.9$$\n\n**2. Fractional Sensitivity to Bcd Fluctuations**\nThe fractional sensitivity, $S$, is defined as $S = \\left|\\frac{\\partial \\ln f}{\\partial \\ln [B]}\\right|$. We use the chain rule to express this in terms of $p_B$, as $f$ is a direct function of $p_B$ and $p_H$, and $p_B$ is a function of $[B]$. Since $p_H$ is treated as a constant with respect to $[B]$:\n$$S = \\left|\\frac{d \\ln f}{d p_B} \\frac{d p_B}{d \\ln [B]}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{1}{f} \\frac{d f}{d p_B} \\frac{d p_B}{d \\ln [B]}\\right|$$\n\nThe term $\\frac{d p_B}{d \\ln [B]}$ depends on the Hill function nature of Bcd binding. For a general Hill function $p([X]) = \\frac{[X]^n}{K^n + [X]^n}$, it can be shown that:\n$$\\frac{d p}{d \\ln [X]} = [X]\\frac{dp}{d[X]} = n \\cdot p \\cdot (1-p)$$\nThus, for Bcd binding, we have:\n$$\\frac{d p_B}{d \\ln [B]} = n_B \\cdot p_B \\cdot (1-p_B)$$\nwhere $n_B$ is the Hill coefficient for Bcd.\n\nNow, we can write the sensitivity for any enhancer logic as:\n$$S = \\left|\\frac{1}{f} \\frac{d f}{d p_B} n_B p_B (1-p_B)\\right|$$\n\n**3. Sensitivity Calculation for Each Enhancer**\n\n*   **AND-like Enhancer (X):**\n    $f_{\\mathrm{AND}} = p_B p_H$. The derivative with respect to $p_B$ is $\\frac{d f_{\\mathrm{AND}}}{d p_B} = p_H$.\n    Substituting into the sensitivity formula:\n    $$S_{\\mathrm{AND}} = \\left|\\frac{1}{p_B p_H} (p_H) n_B p_B (1-p_B)\\right| = |n_B(1-p_B)|$$\n    Since $n_B > 0$ and $0 \\le p_B \\le 1$, this simplifies to:\n    $$S_{\\mathrm{AND}} = n_B (1-p_B)$$\n    At $x^\\*$, where $p_B=0.5$:\n    $$S_{\\mathrm{AND}} = n_B (1-0.5) = 0.5 n_B$$\n\n*   **OR-like Enhancer (Y):**\n    $f_{\\mathrm{OR}} = p_B + p_H - p_B p_H$. The derivative is $\\frac{d f_{\\mathrm{OR}}}{d p_B} = 1 - p_H$.\n    Substituting into the sensitivity formula:\n    $$S_{\\mathrm{OR}} = \\left|\\frac{1}{p_B + p_H - p_B p_H} (1-p_H) n_B p_B (1-p_B)\\right|$$\n    At $x^\\*$, where $p_B=0.5$ and $p_H=0.8$, and we already found $f_{\\mathrm{OR}} = 0.9$:\n    $$S_{\\mathrm{OR}} = \\left|\\frac{1}{0.9} (1-0.8) n_B (0.5)(1-0.5)\\right| = \\frac{1}{0.9} (0.2) n_B (0.25) = \\frac{0.05}{0.9} n_B = \\frac{5}{90} n_B = \\frac{1}{18} n_B$$\n\n**4. Relative Robustness**\nRobustness is inversely related to sensitivity $S$. To compare the robustness of the two enhancers, we compare their sensitivities $S_{\\mathrm{AND}}$ and $S_{\\mathrm{OR}}$. The ratio of sensitivities at $x^\\*$ is:\n$$\\frac{S_{\\mathrm{AND}}}{S_{\\mathrm{OR}}} = \\frac{0.5 n_B}{(1/18) n_B} = 0.5 \\times 18 = 9$$\nThis shows that $S_{\\mathrm{AND}} = 9 \\cdot S_{\\mathrm{OR}}$. The sensitivity of the AND-like enhancer is 9 times greater than that of the OR-like enhancer. Consequently, the OR-like enhancer is significantly more robust to small fluctuations in Bcd concentration at this position.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. At $x^\\*$, the AND-like enhancer has baseline output $f_{\\mathrm{AND}} \\approx 0.4$ while the OR-like enhancer has $f_{\\mathrm{OR}} \\approx 0.9$. The OR-like enhancer is substantially more robust to small fractional fluctuations in $[B]$ than the AND-like enhancer; at these occupancies the log-sensitivity of OR to $[B]$ is lower by a factor of approximately $9$.**\n- Our calculation yields $f_{\\mathrm{AND}} = 0.4$ and $f_{\\mathrm{OR}} = 0.9$. This is correct.\n- Our calculation shows $S_{\\mathrm{AND}} = 9 S_{\\mathrm{OR}}$. This means the sensitivity of the OR enhancer is lower by a factor of 9, making it more robust. This is also correct.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. At $x^\\*$, both enhancers have identical fractional sensitivity to $[B]$ when $p_B = 0.5$, but the OR-like enhancer has the lower baseline output.**\n- The sensitivities are $S_{\\mathrm{AND}} = 0.5 n_B$ and $S_{\\mathrm{OR}} = (1/18) n_B$. These are not identical (for any biologically meaningful $n_B > 0$).\n- The OR-like enhancer has a *higher* baseline output ($0.9$) than the AND-like enhancer ($0.4$).\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Whenever $p_H > p_B$, the AND-like enhancer is more robust than the OR-like enhancer to fluctuations in $[B]$; thus at $x^\\*$ the AND-like enhancer buffers Bcd fluctuations better.**\n- More robust means lower sensitivity, i.e., $S_{\\mathrm{AND}} < S_{\\mathrm{OR}}$. Let's evaluate this general condition:\n$$n_B (1-p_B) < n_B \\frac{p_B(1-p_B)(1-p_H)}{p_B + p_H - p_B p_H}$$\nFor $0 < p_B < 1$ and $n_B > 0$, we can simplify this to:\n$$1 < \\frac{p_B(1-p_H)}{p_B+p_H-p_B p_H} \\implies p_B+p_H-p_B p_H < p_B-p_B p_H \\implies p_H < 0$$\nThis is impossible since $p_H$ is a probability. Therefore, the premise that the AND enhancer can be more robust is false (for $0<p_H<1$). It is always less robust or equally robust (in limiting cases).

From these principles, derive ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for $E_1(t)$ and $W_2(t)$ of the form production minus first-order loss, in which $E_1$ production depends on $W_2$ via $H(W_2;K_{WE},n_E)$ and $W_2$ production depends on $E_1$ via $H(E_1;K_{EW},n_W)$.\n\n2.

It presents a standard exercise in modeling and analyzing a biological dynamical system. Therefore, I will proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe problem requires a four-part analysis of a minimal two-cell-row model for the Engrailed-Wingless segment polarity network in *Drosophila*. Let $E_1(t)$ be the concentration of Engrailed protein in cell row $1$ and $W_2(t)$ be the concentration of Wingless protein in cell row $2$.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the ordinary differential equations (ODEs).\nThe evolution of a gene product's concentration is described by the balance of production and removal. The problem specifies that removal is a first-order process, and production is activated via a Hill function.\n\nFor the concentration of Engrailed, $E_1(t)$, the rate of change is:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_1}{dt} = (\\text{Production of } E_1) - (\\text{Removal of } E_1)\n$$\nThe production of $E_1$ is activated by the signaling ligand $W_2$. This is modeled as a maximal production rate $\\alpha_E$ modulated by the Hill function $H(W_2; K_{WE}, n_E)$. The removal of $E_1$ is a first-order process with rate constant $\\delta_E$, meaning the removal rate is $\\delta_E E_1$. This leads to the first ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_1}{dt} = \\alpha_E H(W_2; K_{WE}, n_E) - \\delta_E E_1 = \\alpha_E \\frac{W_2^{n_E}}{K_{WE}^{n_E} + W_2^{n_E}} - \\delta_E E_1\n$$\nSimilarly, for the concentration of Wingless, $W_2(t)$, the production is activated by $E_1$ and modulated by the Hill function $H(E_1; K_{EW}, n_W)$. The removal is a first-order process with rate constant $\\delta_W$. This leads to the second ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dW_2}{dt} = \\alpha_W H(E_1; K_{EW}, n_W) - \\delta_W W_2 = \\alpha_W \\frac{E_1^{n_W}}{K_{EW}^{n_W} + E_1^{n_W}} - \\delta_W W_2\n$$\nThese two coupled ODEs constitute the dynamical model for the system.\n\nPart 2: Computation of the high-high steady state $(E_1^\\ast,W_2^\\ast)$.\nA steady state $(E_1^\\ast,W_2^\\ast)$ is a point where the concentrations do not change over time, i.e., $\\frac{dE_1}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dW_2}{dt} = 0$. The problem specifies the \"strongly saturated regime,\" where the Hill functions approximate to $1$. This happens when the activator concentration is much greater than its respective Hill constant ($E_1 \\gg K_{EW}$ and $W_2 \\gg K_{WE}$). Under this assumption, $H(W_2; K_{WE}, n_E) \\approx 1$ and $H(E_1; K_{EW}, n_W) \\approx 1$.\n\nThe steady-state equations simplify to:\n$$\n0 = \\alpha_E (1) - \\delta_E E_1^\\ast\n$$\n$$\n0 = \\alpha_W (1) - \\delta_W W_2^\\ast\n$$\nSolving these algebraic equations for $E_1^\\ast$ and $W_2^\\ast$ gives:\n$$\nE_1^\\ast = \\frac{\\alpha_E}{\\delta_E}\n$$\n$$\nW_2^\\ast = \\frac{\\alpha_W}{\\delta_W}\n$$\nSubstituting the given parameter values: $\\alpha_E = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{nM\\,min}^{-1}$, $\\delta_E = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, $\\alpha_W = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{nM\\,min}^{-1}$, $\\delta_W = 0.075\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$:\n$$\nE_1^\\ast = \\frac{2.0}{0.20} = 10\n$$\n$$\nW_2^\\ast = \\frac{1.5}{0.075} = 20\n$$\nThe coordinates of the high-high steady state are $(E_1^\\ast, W_2^\\ast) = (10, 20)$. The units are $\\mathrm{nM}$. The saturation assumption is self-consistent as $E_1^\\ast = 10 \\gg K_{EW} = 2.0$ and $W_2^\\ast = 20 \\gg K_{WE} = 2.0$.\n\nPart 3: Linearization and the Jacobian matrix.\nTo analyze the stability of the steady state, we linearize the system by computing the Jacobian matrix $J$ evaluated at $(E_1^\\ast, W_2^\\ast)$. The system is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_1}{dt} = f(E_1, W_2) = \\alpha_E \\frac{W_2^{n_E}}{K_{WE}^{n_E} + W_2^{n_E}} - \\delta_E E_1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dW_2}{dt} = g(E_1, W_2) = \\alpha_W \\frac{E_1^{n_W}}{K_{EW}^{n_W} + E_1^{n_W}} - \\delta_W W_2\n$$\nThe Jacobian matrix is defined as $J = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E_1} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial W_2} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial E_1} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial W_2} \\end{pmatrix}$.
