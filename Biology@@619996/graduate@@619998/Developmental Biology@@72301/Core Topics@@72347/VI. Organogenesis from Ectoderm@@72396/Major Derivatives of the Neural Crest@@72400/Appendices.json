Consider a homogeneous population of $1{,}000$ cranial neural crest mesenchymal progenitors that undergo exactly $3$ synchronous rounds of symmetric division under odontogenic inductive signals. Use the following biologically grounded assumptions:\n\n1. Symmetric division produces two daughters that share the same fate.\n2. For uncommitted progenitors at the time of their first division, odontogenic commitment occurs with probability $p = 0.8$, yielding two odontogenic daughters; with probability $1 - p = 0.2$, the division yields two non-odontogenic daughters.\n3. Fate commitment is heritable across subsequent divisions; once a clone is odontogenic, all of its descendants remain odontogenic, and similarly for non-odontogenic.\n4. There is no cell death, and all cells complete all $3$ rounds of division.\n5. Because the cohort is large and the environment homogeneous, assume that the realized fraction of commitment events equals the bias exactly; that is, exactly a fraction $p$ of first-round divisions yield odontogenic daughters.\n\nUnder these assumptions, calculate the total number of odontoblast-lineage cells present after the $3$ rounds of division. Provide your answer as an exact integer with no units.", "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded within the context of a simplified developmental biology model, well-posed, and objective. All necessary information is provided for a unique, deterministic solution.\n\nWe begin by formalizing the provided information. The initial population of cranial neural crest mesenchymal progenitors is $N_0 = 1,000$. These cells undergo $k=3$ synchronous rounds of symmetric division.\n\nThe critical event is the fate commitment during the first round of division. The problem states that for an uncommitted progenitor, the division results in two odontogenic daughters with probability $p = 0.8$, and two non-odontogenic daughters with probability $1-p = 0.2$. Crucially, assumption $5$ mandates that we treat this probability as an exact fraction for the entire cohort. Therefore, the initial population of $N_0$ cells is partitioned at the moment of the first division.\n\nThe number of progenitors that will commit to the odontogenic lineage is given by:\n$$N_{\\text{odonto, progenitors}} = N_0 \\times p$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$N_{\\text{odonto, progenitors}} = 1,000 \\times 0.8 = 800$$\nThese $800$ progenitors will give rise to clones of odontoblast-lineage cells.\n\nSimilarly, the number of progenitors that will commit to the non-odontogenic lineage is:\n$$N_{\\text{non-odonto, progenitors}} = N_0 \\times (1 - p)$$\n$$N_{\\text{non-odonto, progenitors}} = 1,000 \\times 0.2 = 200$$\nNote that $800 + 200 = 1,000$, which correctly accounts for the entire initial population.\n\nAccording to assumption $3$, this fate commitment is permanent and heritable. Thus, the two populations of cells—the odontogenic lineage and the non-odontogenic lineage—will expand clonally for all $k=3$ rounds of division without any further change in fate.\n\nThe process of symmetric division means the cell population doubles at each round. For a single progenitor cell undergoing $k$ rounds of division, the total number of descendants is $2^k$.\n\nWe need to calculate the total number of odontoblast-lineage cells after $k=3$ rounds. This population originates from the $N_{\\text{odonto, progenitors}} = 800$ cells that committed to this fate. These $800$ cells, and all their subsequent progeny, will divide a total of $3$ times.\n\nThe final number of odontoblast-lineage cells, which we denote as $N_{\\text{odonto, final}}$, is calculated by taking the initial number of committed progenitors and multiplying by the expansion factor over $k=3$ rounds.\n$$N_{\\text{odonto, final}} = N_{\\text{odonto, progenitors}} \\times 2^k$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$N_{\\text{odonto, final}} = 800 \\times 2^3$$\nCalculating the power of $2$:\n$$2^3 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$$\nNow, we perform the final multiplication:\n$$N_{\\text{odonto, final}} = 800 \\times 8 = 6,400$$\n\nThus, after $3$ complete rounds of division, there will be a total of $6,400$ cells belonging to the odontoblast lineage. As a check for consistency, the total number of non-odontogenic cells would be $N_{\\text{non-odonto, progenitors}} \\times 2^k = 200 \\times 8 = 1,600$. The total cell count is $6,400 + 1,600 = 8,000$. This is consistent with the initial population of $N_0 = 1,000$ cells undergoing $3$ doublings: $1,000 \\times 2^3 = 1,000 \\times 8 = 8,000$.

Two independent Cre-driver lines are used with the same reporter: Wnt1-Cre to label neural crest derivatives and Sox17-Cre to label endodermal derivatives. Assume perfect driver specificity (no off-target recombination) and that Cre recombinase (Cre) has the same recombination efficiency within its correctly targeted lineage across both drivers.\n\nFrom a random sample of $1000$ calcitonin-positive cells in the Wnt1-Cre cross, $100$ are reporter-labeled. From an independent random sample of $1000$ calcitonin-positive cells in the Sox17-Cre cross, $800$ are reporter-labeled.\n\nUse a binomial sampling model grounded in standard lineage tracing logic: let $\\theta_{N}$ be the true fraction of calcitonin-positive cells that are neural crest–derived, and $1-\\theta_{N}$ the true fraction that are endoderm-derived.

Lineage tracing using Cre-Lox systems is a standard technique in developmental biology. The use of `Wnt1` and `Sox17` as markers for neural crest and endoderm, respectively, is appropriate. The central biological question—the embryonic origin of thyroid C cells—is a classic topic in the field. The probabilistic model is a direct and logical formalization of the experimental setup, where labeling requires both belonging to the correct lineage and a successful recombination event. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and a clear objective. It is stated with objectivity and precision. The assumptions of perfect specificity and equal efficiency are idealizations, but are explicitly stated as premises for this specific problem, which is a common practice in modeling exercises. The problem is not trivial, as it requires application of statistical principles (maximum likelihood estimation) to a biological model. It is self-contained and internally consistent.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for $\\theta_{N}$, the fraction of calcitonin-positive cells originating from the neural crest. We are given two independent experiments.\n\nLet $K_1$ be the random variable representing the number of reporter-labeled cells observed in the `Wnt1-Cre` experiment. The sampling process is modeled as binomial, so $K_1 \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n_1, p_1)$, where the sample size is $n_1 = 1000$ and the probability of a single cell being labeled is $p_1$.\nSimilarly, let $K_2$ be the random variable for the labeled cells in the `Sox17-Cre` experiment, with $K_2 \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n_2, p_2)$, where $n_2 = 1000$ and the labeling probability is $p_2$.\n\nThe problem provides the biological basis for the probabilities $p_1$ and $p_2$.\nIn the `Wnt1-Cre` cross, a C cell is labeled if and only if it is derived from the neural crest (with probability $\\theta_N$) AND the Cre-recombinase successfully excises the reporter cassette (with probability $r$). Due to the assumption of perfect driver specificity, a cell of endodermal origin has zero chance of being labeled. Thus, the total probability of labeling is the product of these independent probabilities:\n$$p_1 = r\\,\\theta_{N}$$\nIn the `Sox17-Cre` cross, a C cell is labeled if and only if it is derived from the endoderm (with probability $1-\\theta_N$) AND the recombination is successful (with probability $r$). Thus:\n$$p_2 = r\\,(1-\\theta_{N})$$\n\nThe problem states that for large sample sizes, the MLE of a binomial probability $p$ can be taken as the observed proportion $\\hat{p} = k/n$. We are given the observed counts $k_1 = 100$ and $k_2 = 800$.\nThe MLE for $p_1$ is therefore:\n$$\\hat{p}_1 = \\frac{k_1}{n_1} = \\frac{100}{1000} = \\frac{1}{10}$$\nThe MLE for $p_2$ is:\n$$\\hat{p}_2 = \\frac{k_2}{n_2} = \\frac{800}{1000} = \\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{4}{5}$$\n\nThe invariance property of maximum likelihood estimators states that if $\\hat{\\phi}$ is the MLE of a parameter $\\phi$, then for any function $g$, the MLE of $g(\\phi)$ is $g(\\hat{\\phi})$. Applying this principle, we can establish a system of equations for the MLEs of our parameters of interest, $\\hat{\\theta}_N$ and $\\hat{r}$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\hat{p}_1 = \\hat{r}\\,\\hat{\\theta}_{N} \\\\\n\\hat{p}_2 = \\hat{r}\\,(1-\\hat{\\theta}_{N})\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nSubstituting the estimated probabilities, we have:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{10} = \\hat{r}\\,\\hat{\\theta}_{N} & (1) \\\\\n\\frac{8}{10} = \\hat{r}\\,(1-\\hat{\\theta}_{N}) & (2)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis is a system of two algebraic equations with two unknowns, $\\hat{\\theta}_{N}$ and $\\hat{r}$. To solve this system, we can add the two equations to eliminate $\\hat{\\theta}_{N}$ and find $\\hat{r}$:\n$$ \\hat{p}_1 + \\hat{p}_2 = \\hat{r}\\,\\hat{\\theta}_{N} + \\hat{r}\\,(1-\\hat{\\theta}_{N}) $$\n$$ \\hat{p}_1 + \\hat{p}_2 = \\hat{r}(\\hat{\\theta}_{N} + 1 - \\hat{\\theta}_{N}) $$\n$$ \\hat{p}_1 + \\hat{p}_2 = \\hat{r} $$\nSubstituting the numerical values for $\\hat{p}_1$ and $\\hat{p}_2$:\n$$ \\hat{r} = \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{9}{10} $$\nSo, the estimated common recombination efficiency is $\\hat{r} = 0.9$. This is a biologically plausible value, as Cre-Lox systems are highly but not perfectly efficient.\n\nNow we solve for $\\hat{\\theta}_N$. One method is to divide equation $(1)$ by the sum $(\\hat{p}_1 + \\hat{p}_2)$:\n$$ \\hat{\\theta}_{N} = \\frac{\\hat{p}_1}{\\hat{p}_1 + \\hat{p}_2} = \\frac{\\hat{r}\\,\\hat{\\theta}_{N}}{\\hat{r}} $$\nThis gives the MLE for $\\theta_N$ directly in terms of the estimated probabilities. Substituting the values:\n$$ \\hat{\\theta}_{N} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{10}}{\\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{8}{10}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{10}}{\\frac{9}{10}} $$\n$$ \\hat{\\theta}_{N} = \\frac{1}{9} $$\nThe maximum likelihood estimate for the fraction of calcitonin-positive cells derived from the neural crest is $\\frac{1}{9}$.\n\nConsequently, the estimated fraction derived from the endoderm is $1 - \\hat{\\theta}_N = 1 - \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{8}{9}$. As $\\frac{8}{9} > \\frac{1}{9}$, the endodermal origin is substantially more likely for this cell population under the given model and data. This finding aligns with the modern consensus in developmental biology, which has established the ultimobranchial body, an endodermal structure, as the primary source of C cells in mammals.\nThe derivation is complete and consistent.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{9}}$$", "id": "2649182"}, {"introduction": "At the heart of fate specification are gene regulatory networks that function as molecular switches.

The task is to construct a model for a genetic toggle switch, non-dimensionalize it, and determine the critical parameter value at which it becomes bistable.\n\nFirst, we formulate the mathematical model. Let $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ represent the concentrations of the proteins Runx2 and Sox9, respectively. The system is described by a pair of coupled ordinary differential equations. The production of each protein is repressed by the other, modeled by a standard repressive Hill function. Degradation is assumed to be a linear process.

The time derivative transforms according to the chain rule: $\\frac{d}{dt} = \\frac{d\\tau}{dt}\\frac{d}{d\\tau} = \\delta \\frac{d}{d\\tau}$.\nSubstituting these into the first ODE for $x$:\n$$ \\delta \\frac{d(uK)}{d\\tau} = \\frac{\\alpha K^n}{K^n + (vK)^n} - \\delta (uK) $$\n$$ K\\delta \\frac{du}{d\\tau} = \\frac{\\alpha K^n}{K^n(1 + v^n)} - \\delta uK $$\nDividing the entire equation by $K\\delta$:\n$$ \\frac{du}{d\\tau} = \\frac{\\alpha}{K\\delta} \\frac{1}{1 + v^n} - u $$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\beta$:\n$$ \\frac{du}{d\\tau} = \\frac{\\beta}{1 + v^n} - u $$\nDue to the perfect symmetry of the system, the equation for $v$ is analogous:\n$$ \\frac{dv}{d\\tau} = \\frac{\\beta}{1 + u^n} - v $$\nThis provides the required non-dimensionalized two-variable ODE model.\n\nThe second part of the task is to analyze the stability of this system and find the onset of bistability. Bistability emerges when the symmetric steady state, where the concentrations are equal, loses its stability.\nWe begin by finding the fixed points (steady states) of the non-dimensionalized system by setting the time derivatives to zero:\n$$ u = \\frac{\\beta}{1 + v^n} $$\n$$ v = \\frac{\\beta}{1 + u^n} $$\nThe problem directs us to analyze the symmetric case, where $u=v$.

The system functions are $f(u,v) = \\frac{\\beta}{1+v^n} - u$ and $g(u,v) = \\frac{\\beta}{1+u^n} - v$.\nThe Jacobian is:\n$$ J(u,v) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial v} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -\\frac{\\beta n v^{n-1}}{(1+v^n)^2} \\\\ -\\frac{\\beta n u^{n-1}}{(1+u^n)^2} & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe evaluate this matrix at the symmetric fixed point $(u_s, u_s)$:\n$$ J(u_s, u_s) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -\\frac{\\beta n u_s^{n-1}}{(1+u_s^n)^2} \\\\ -\\frac{\\beta n u_s^{n-1}}{(1+u_s^n)^2} & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nLet us simplify the off-diagonal term using the fixed-point relation $\\beta = u_s(1+u_s^n)$:\n$$ -\\frac{\\beta n u_s^{n-1}}{(1+u_s^n)^2} = -\\frac{u_s(1+u_s^n) n u_s^{n-1}}{(1+u_s^n)^2} = -\\frac{n u_s^n}{1+u_s^n} $$\nLet us denote this simplified term as $A = -\\frac{n u_s^n}{1+u_s^n}$.

Therefore, $\\lambda_1$ is always negative.\nStability is lost when $\\lambda_2$ ceases to be negative. The onset of instability, a pitchfork bifurcation in this symmetric system, occurs precisely when $\\lambda_2 = 0$.\nThe condition for the bifurcation is:\n$$ -1 + \\frac{n u_s^n}{1+u_s^n} = 0 $$\n$$ n u_s^n = 1 + u_s^n $$\n$$ (n-1)u_s^n = 1 $$\nThis gives the value of $u_s^n$ at the critical point:\n$$ u_s^n = \\frac{1}{n-1} $$\nFrom this, the steady-state concentration at the bifurcation point is $u_s = \\left(\\frac{1}{n-1}\\right)^{1/n}$.\n\nFinally, we find the critical value of the parameter $\\beta$, denoted $\\beta_c(n)$, by substituting these critical values back into the fixed point equation $\\beta = u_s(1+u_s^n)$:\n$$ \\beta_c(n) = \\left(\\frac{1}{n-1}\\right)^{1/n} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n-1}\\right) $$\nSimplifying the second term:\n$$ 1 + \\frac{1}{n-1} = \\frac{n-1+1}{n-1} = \\frac{n}{n-1} $$\nSubstituting this back gives the expression for $\\beta_c(n)$:\n$$ \\beta_c(n) = \\frac{n}{n-1} \\left(\\frac{1}{n-1}\\right)^{1/n} $$\nThis can be combined into a single expression:\n$$ \\beta_c(n) = \\frac{n}{(n-1)^{1} (n-1)^{1/n}} = \\frac{n}{(n-1)^{1+1/n}} $$\nThe exponent can be simplified as $1+\\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{n+1}{n}$.
