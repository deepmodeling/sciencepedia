Consider a single epithelial cell approximated in two-dimensional cross-section as a trapezoid with apical width $w_a$, basal width $w_b$, and height $h$. Assume the following fundamental bases: (i) mechanical equilibrium is obtained by minimizing a mechanical energy or, equivalently, by force-balance on each edge; (ii) the cytoplasm is effectively incompressible over the time scale of interest, so the apicobasal cross-sectional area $S$ is conserved; and (iii) the small-strain constitutive response of each edge is linear.\n\nLet the apical cortex behave as a linear contractile element with effective tension $T_a$ related to apical width by $T_a = k_a\\,(w_{a0} - w_a)$, where $k_a$ is an effective apical stiffness and $w_{a0}$ is the reference apical width prior to constriction. Let the basal edge have a passive line tension $T_b = k_b\\,(w_b - w_{b0})$ opposed by a basal adhesion $A_b$ that acts as a constant adhesive force tending to increase $w_b$. Let the lateral sides have an effective tension $T_l = k_l\\,(h - h_0)$, where $k_l$ and $h_0$ are the lateral stiffness and reference height, respectively.

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a rigorous solution can be constructed.\n\nWe will address the two tasks in sequence.\n\nTask 1: Derivation of the force-balance relation.\n\nThe problem asks for a derivation based on mechanical equilibrium, which can be found by minimizing the total mechanical energy $U$ of the cell, subject to the constraint of constant cross-sectional area $S$.\n\nThe total mechanical energy $U$ is the sum of the potential energies stored in the apical, basal, and lateral elements.\nThe energy stored in the apical contractile cortex is $U_a = \\frac{1}{2} k_a (w_{a0} - w_a)^2$.\nThe energy stored in the passive basal edge is $U_b = \\frac{1}{2} k_b (w_b - w_{b0})^2$.\nThe potential energy associated with the constant basal adhesion force $A_b$ is $U_{ad} = -A_b w_b$, as this force performs positive work when $w_b$ increases.\nThe energy in the two lateral sides is given as a function of height $h$, $U_l = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} k_l (h-h_0)^2 = k_l(h-h_0)^2$.\n\nThe total potential energy is:\n$$U(w_a, w_b, h) = \\frac{1}{2} k_a (w_{a0} - w_a)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k_b (w_b - w_{b0})^2 - A_b w_b + k_l (h-h_0)^2$$\n\nThis energy must be minimized subject to the area conservation constraint:\n$$S(w_a, w_b, h) = \\frac{(w_a + w_b)h}{2} - S_0 = 0$$\n\nWe employ the method of Lagrange multipliers.

For the system to be in mechanical equilibrium, the partial derivatives of $\\mathcal{L}$ with respect to each variable ($w_a$, $w_b$, $h$) must be zero.\n\n1.  $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w_a} = -k_a(w_{a0} - w_a) - \\lambda \\frac{h}{2} = 0$\n    Using the definition $T_a = k_a(w_{a0} - w_a)$, this becomes:\n    $$-T_a - \\lambda \\frac{h}{2} = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\lambda \\frac{h}{2} = -T_a$$\n\n2.  $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w_b} = k_b(w_b - w_{b0}) - A_b - \\lambda \\frac{h}{2} = 0$\n    Using the definition $T_b = k_b(w_b - w_{b0})$, this becomes:\n    $$T_b - A_b - \\lambda \\frac{h}{2} = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\lambda \\frac{h}{2} = T_b - A_b$$\n\nBy equating the expressions for $\\lambda \\frac{h}{2}$ from these two equilibrium conditions, we eliminate the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$ and the geometric variable $h$:\n$$-T_a = T_b - A_b$$\nRearranging this equation gives the required scalar force-balance relation:\n$$T_a + T_b = A_b$$\nThis equation represents the balance of effective horizontal forces on the cell. The sum of the inward-pulling tensions on the apical and basal sides is balanced by the outward-pulling adhesion force on the basal side.\n\nTask 2: Calculation of the new cell height.\n\nFor this task, the problem specifies a new set of conditions determining the cell geometry. We use the provided parameter values to calculate the final height $h$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the conserved area $S_0$ from the initial geometry: $w_{a0} = 6$, $w_{b0} = 8$, $h_0 = 20$.\n$$S_0 = \\frac{(w_{a0} + w_{b0})h_0}{2} = \\frac{(6 + 8) \\times 20}{2} = \\frac{14 \\times 20}{2} = 140$$\n\nNext, we determine the new basal width $w_b$. The problem states that it is fixed by the basal force-balance $T_b - A_b = 0$.\n$$T_b = A_b \\implies k_b(w_b - w_{b0}) = A_b$$\nSubstituting the given values $k_b = 20$, $w_{b0} = 8$, and $A_b = 5$:\n$$20(w_b - 8) = 5 \\implies w_b - 8 = \\frac{5}{20} = 0.25 \\implies w_b = 8.25$$\n\nThen, we determine the new apical width $w_a$. After activation, the apical tension is fixed at $T_a = 40$. We use its constitutive relation to find $w_a$:\n$$T_a = k_a(w_{a0} - w_a)$$\nSubstituting the values $T_a = 40$, $k_a = 25$, and $w_{a0} = 6$:\n$$40 = 25(6 - w_a) \\implies 6 - w_a = \\frac{40}{25} = 1.6 \\implies w_a = 6 - 1.6 = 4.4$$\n\nFinally, we use the area conservation law to compute the new height $h$ with the new widths $w_a$ and $w_b$:\n$$S_0 = \\frac{(w_a + w_b)h}{2}$$\n$$140 = \\frac{(4.4 + 8.25)h}{2} = \\frac{12.65 h}{2}$$\nSolving for $h$:\n$$h = \\frac{2 \\times 140}{12.65} = \\frac{280}{12.65} \\approx 22.134387...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$h \\approx 22.13$$\n\nThe final height of the cell is $22.13$ micrometers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{22.13}$$", "id": "2637612"}, {"introduction": "Large-scale tissue morphogenesis, like the outward budding of the optic vesicle, emerges from the collective behavior of individual cells.

Work per unit out-of-plane depth. Assume all quantities are homogeneous along the sheet.\n\nConsider a strip-like tissue of thickness $h$ and midline width $w$ that can adopt curvature $\\kappa$ (signed scalar curvature, positive for outward evagination). The strip has an apical surface of length $l_a$ and a basal surface of length $l_b$ measured over the same midline width $w$. Assume small-curvature geometry so that the apical and basal surfaces are concentric offsets of the midline, and only leading order in $\\kappa$ is required. The apical surface experiences line tension $T_a$ due to apical actomyosin contractility. The basal surface has an intrinsic line tension $T_b$ and an effective adhesion energy per unit length $J_b$ to a flat, compliant basement membrane (extracellular matrix, ECM), which lowers energy when basal length increases while remaining in contact. Treat bending of the sheet as a quadratic energetic penalty per midline length with stiffness $B$. Assume that, to leading order in curvature, basal contact is maintained and the basal adhesion energy scales with the basal length.\n\nStarting from these definitions and geometric considerations only, and without invoking any pre-derived target formulas, do the following:\n\n1.

We may therefore proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe problem asks for an analysis of a continuum mechanical model for a neuroepithelial sheet, with the goal of determining the conditions under which it will spontaneously bend, representing outward evagination. We will follow the four specified tasks.\n\n1.  **Expression for Total Energy per Unit Midline Width**\n\nWe consider a strip of epithelial tissue of thickness $h$ and midline length (width) $w$. The total mechanical energy $E$ of the system, per unit out-of-plane depth, is given as the sum of four contributions: apical line tension, basal line tension, basal adhesion to a substrate, and bending energy.\n\nThe apical energy, $E_a$, arises from the contractility of the apical surface, modeled as a line tension $T_a$ acting along its length $l_a$.\n$$E_a = T_a l_a$$\n\nThe basal surface has an intrinsic line tension $T_b$ and an adhesive interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM) characterized by an adhesion energy per unit length $J_b$. Adhesion lowers the total energy, so its contribution is negative. The total energy from the basal surface of length $l_b$ is thus:\n$$E_b + E_{adh} = T_b l_b - J_b l_b = (T_b - J_b) l_b$$\nHere, $(T_b - J_b)$ can be interpreted as the effective tension of the basal surface.\n\nThe bending energy, $E_{bend}$, penalizes curvature $\\kappa$ and is proportional to the square of the curvature and the length of the midline, with a bending stiffness $B$.\n$$E_{bend} = \\frac{1}{2} B \\kappa^2 w$$\n\nThe total energy $E(\\kappa)$ is the sum of these components:\n$$E(\\kappa) = E_a + E_b + E_{adh} + E_{bend} = T_a l_a + (T_b - J_b) l_b + \\frac{1}{2} B \\kappa^2 w$$\n\nThe a-dimensional quantity of interest is the energy per unit midline width, $\\mathcal{E}(\\kappa) = E(\\kappa)/w$:\n$$\\mathcal{E}(\\kappa) = T_a \\frac{l_a}{w} + (T_b - J_b) \\frac{l_b}{w} + \\frac{1}{2} B \\kappa^2$$\n\n2.  **Geometric Relations and Energy in Terms of Curvature**\n\nWe now derive the geometric relations for the lengths $l_a$ and $l_b$ under the assumption of small curvature. The geometry is a set of concentric circular arcs. The midline, with curvature $\\kappa = 1/R$ where $R$ is its radius of curvature, has length $w$. The apical and basal surfaces are at distances $h/2$ from the midline. The apical surface is positioned towards the center of curvature, and the basal surface is positioned away from it.\n\nThe radius of the apical arc is $R_a = R - h/2 = 1/\\kappa - h/2$.\nThe radius of the basal arc is $R_b = R + h/2 = 1/\\kappa + h/2$.\n\nFor a segment subtending an angle $\\theta$, the arc lengths are $w = R\\theta$, $l_a = R_a\\theta$, and $l_b = R_b\\theta$. The ratios of the lengths are therefore:\n$$\\frac{l_a}{w} = \\frac{R_a\\theta}{R\\theta} = \\frac{R - h/2}{R} = 1 - \\frac{h}{2R} = 1 - \\frac{h\\kappa}{2}$$\n$$\\frac{l_b}{w} = \\frac{R_b\\theta}{R\\theta} = \\frac{R + h/2}{R} = 1 + \\frac{h}{2R} = 1 + \\frac{h\\kappa}{2}$$\nThese expressions are linear in $\\kappa$ and are considered the leading-order terms for the geometry.\n\nSubstituting these into the energy expression $\\mathcal{E}(\\kappa)$:\n$$\\mathcal{E}(\\kappa) = T_a \\left(1 - \\frac{h\\kappa}{2}\\right) + (T_b - J_b) \\left(1 + \\frac{h\\kappa}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2} B \\kappa^2$$\n\nExpanding and collecting terms in powers of $\\kappa$ yields a quadratic function:\n$$\\mathcal{E}(\\kappa) = \\left(T_a + T_b - J_b\\right) + \\left((T_b - J_b)\\frac{h}{2} - T_a\\frac{h}{2}\\right)\\kappa + \\frac{1}{2} B \\kappa^2$$\n$$\\mathcal{E}(\\kappa) = \\frac{1}{2} B \\kappa^2 + \\frac{h}{2}(T_b - J_b - T_a)\\kappa + (T_a + T_b - J_b)$$\n\n3.  **Equilibrium Curvature and Energy Change**\n\nTo find the curvature $\\kappa^\\star$ that minimizes the energy, we take the derivative of $\\mathcal{E}(\\kappa)$ with respect to $\\kappa$ and set it to zero:\n$$\\frac{d\\mathcal{E}}{d\\kappa} = B\\kappa + \\frac{h}{2}(T_b - J_b - T_a) = 0$$\nSolving for the equilibrium curvature $\\kappa^\\star$:\n$$\\kappa^\\star = -\\frac{h}{2B}(T_b - J_b - T_a) = \\frac{h}{2B}(T_a - T_b + J_b)$$\nThe second derivative $\\frac{d^2\\mathcal{E}}{d\\kappa^2} = B$ is positive (as bending stiffness $B$ is a positive physical quantity), confirming that $\\kappa^\\star$ corresponds to an energy minimum.\n\nThe energy change $\\Delta \\mathcal{E}$ is the difference between the energy at the minimum, $\\mathcal{E}(\\kappa^\\star)$, and the energy of the flat state, $\\mathcal{E}(0)$.\nFirst, the energy of the flat state is the constant term in the quadratic:\n$$\\mathcal{E}(0) = T_a + T_b - J_b$$\nThe energy at the minimal curvature is:\n$$\\mathcal{E}(\\kappa^\\star) = \\frac{1}{2} B (\\kappa^\\star)^2 + \\frac{h}{2}(T_b - J_b - T_a)\\kappa^\\star + \\mathcal{E}(0)$$\nFrom the minimization condition, we have $\\frac{h}{2}(T_b - J_b - T_a) = -B\\kappa^\\star$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\mathcal{E}(\\kappa^\\star)$:\n$$\\mathcal{E}(\\kappa^\\star) = \\frac{1}{2} B (\\kappa^\\star)^2 - (B\\kappa^\\star)\\kappa^\\star + \\mathcal{E}(0) = -\\frac{1}{2} B (\\kappa^\\star)^2 + \\mathcal{E}(0)$$\nThus, the energy decrease relative to the flat state is:\n$$\\Delta \\mathcal{E} = \\mathcal{E}(\\kappa^\\star) - \\mathcal{E}(0) = -\\frac{1}{2} B (\\kappa^\\star)^2$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\kappa^\\star$:\n$$\\Delta \\mathcal{E} = -\\frac{1}{2} B \\left(\\frac{h(T_a - T_b + J_b)}{2B}\\right)^2 = -\\frac{h^2 (T_a - T_b + J_b)^2}{8B}$$\n\n4.  **Condition for Favored Outward Evagination**\n\nOutward evagination is favored if and only if $\\kappa^\\star$ is strictly positive and $\\Delta \\mathcal{E}$ is strictly negative. Numerically, this is implemented using a tolerance $\\varepsilon = 10^{-9}$. The conditions are:\n1.  $\\kappa^\\star > \\varepsilon$\n2.  $\\Delta \\mathcal{E}  -\\varepsilon$\n\nLet's analyze these conditions.\nFrom $\\kappa^\\star = \\frac{h}{2B}(T_a - T_b + J_b)$ and the fact that $h > 0$ and $B > 0$, the first condition becomes:\n$$T_a - T_b + J_b > \\frac{2B\\varepsilon}{h}$$\n\nFrom $\\Delta \\mathcal{E} = -\\frac{h^2(T_a - T_b + J_b)^2}{8B}$, the second condition becomes:\n$$-\\frac{h^2(T_a - T_b + J_b)^2}{8B}  -\\varepsilon$$\n$$\\implies (T_a - T_b + J_b)^2 > \\frac{8B\\varepsilon}{h^2}$$\n$$\\implies |T_a - T_b + J_b| > \\frac{\\sqrt{8B\\varepsilon}}{h}$$\n\nSince the first condition requires $T_a - T_b + J_b$ to be positive, its absolute value is itself. So we must satisfy both:\n$$T_a - T_b + J_b > \\frac{2B\\varepsilon}{h} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad T_a - T_b + J_b > \\frac{\\sqrt{8B\\varepsilon}}{h}$$\nThe stricter of the two inequalities determines the final condition. Since $B\\varepsilon$ is very small for the given parameter ranges, $B\\varepsilon  2$, which implies $4B^2\\varepsilon^2  8B\\varepsilon$ and therefore $2B\\varepsilon  \\sqrt{8B\\varepsilon}$. Thus, the second inequality is stricter.\nThe governing condition is $T_a - T_b + J_b > \\frac{\\sqrt{8B\\varepsilon}}{h}$.\nPhysically, spontaneous outward curvature is driven by a net mechanical moment, represented by the term $T_a - T_b + J_b$, which must be sufficiently large and positive to overcome stabilizing effects and satisfy the strict inequality required by the tolerance.\n\nFor the numerical implementation, we will directly compute $\\kappa^\\star$ and $\\Delta \\mathcal{E}$ and then apply the two checks with the given tolerance $\\varepsilon$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the equilibrium curvature and energy change of a neuroepithelial sheet\n    based on a continuum mechanical model.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Test cases: tuples of (T_a, T_b, J_b, h, B)\n    # Units: T_a, T_b, J_b in nN; h in um; B in nN*um^2\n    test_cases = [\n        (0.8, 1.0, 0.2, 5.0, 50.0),   # Case 1 (balanced, boundary)\n        (1.2, 0.8, 0.1, 6.0, 30.0),   # Case 2 (evagination, moderate bending)\n        (0.5, 1.0, 0.1, 8.0, 40.0),   # Case 3 (invagination, control)\n        (2.0, 1.0, 0.3, 10.0, 1000.0), # Case 4 (evagination, stiff tissue)\n        (0.9, 0.6, 0.1, 12.0, 8.0),    # Case 5 (evagination, soft tissue)\n        (0.0, 0.2, 0.5, 5.0, 20.0)     # Case 6 (evagination from strong basal adhesion)\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    # Tolerance for strict inequality checks\n    epsilon = 1e-9\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        Ta, Tb, Jb, h, B = case\n\n        # Check for non-physical parameters.
