This practice sharpens your ability to abstract complex biological interactions into their core logical structure, a crucial skill for forming and testing hypotheses about developmental mechanisms [@problem_id:2632992].", "problem": "A cranial surface ectoderm field adjacent to the forebrain is competent to form a lens placode under appropriate inductive cues. Consider the following core definitions and principles as the fundamental base: the Central Dogma of molecular biology (deoxyribonucleic acid to ribonucleic acid to protein), the concept of tissue competence (a tissue-intrinsic state that permits a specific response to an inductive signal), and epithelial-mesenchymal as well as epithelial-epithelial induction via paracrine morphogens such as Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) and Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), whose receptors activate transcriptional programs through SMAD and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathways, respectively. In the lens system, the preplacodal ectoderm must express the lineage-priming transcription factor Paired Box 6 (PAX6) to be competent, and the adjacent optic vesicle provides inductive signals. Induction is reciprocal in that the lens placode subsequently feeds back to the optic neuroepithelium to refine morphogenesis.\n\nBuild a minimal logical model that formalizes these ideas. Let $P \\in \\{0,1\\}$ denote competence of the preplacodal ectoderm for lens fate (with $P=1$ if PAX6 is present and chromatin at lens enhancers is accessible), let $S \\in \\{0,1\\}$ denote the presence of sufficient paracrine inductive signal at the ectodermal surface (e.g., BMP and FGF at levels that activate their receptors above threshold), and let $L \\in \\{0,1\\}$ denote lens placode induction. Assume that $L$ occurs if and only if both $P$ and $S$ are true, i.e., $L = P \\land S$. Further assume that the optic vesicle is the principal endogenous source of $S$ at the ectodermal interface during the relevant window, and that PAX6 does not autonomously generate $S$.\n\nUsing this model and first principles about competence and paracrine induction, reason through the following perturbations: intact wild type, surgical removal of the optic vesicle, and rescue by an ectopic source providing BMP and FGF at the ectodermal surface in a PAX6-competent ectoderm, versus the same rescue provided to ectoderm that lacks PAX6. Which option best explains, from these principles, why removal of the optic vesicle prevents lens formation in wild type but lens formation can be rescued by ectopic BMP and FGF only when the ectoderm is PAX6-competent?\n\nA. Once PAX6 is expressed, lens fate is intrinsically cell-autonomous; the optic vesicle is dispensable for induction and only modulates timing. Ectopic BMP and FGF accelerate an internal program that would occur regardless of external cues.\n\nB. The optic vesicle primarily supplies a permissive mechanical scaffold; without it, the ectoderm cannot invaginate into a lens, but BMP and FGF stiffen the ectoderm sufficiently to mimic the scaffold. Competence is not a limiting factor in this context.\n\nC. The optic vesicle supplies necessary and sufficient paracrine inductive cues, including BMP and FGF, that convert a PAX6-positive competent ectoderm into a lens placode; removal eliminates these cues so that $S=0$ and $L=0$. Ectopic BMP and FGF restore $S=1$ and thus $L=1$ only if $P=1$, whereas PAX6-negative ectoderm ($P=0$) cannot respond to $S$ and fails to form a lens.\n\nD. The optic vesicle secretes Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) that represses lens formation; removal of the optic vesicle derepresses the ectoderm, but excess PAX6 prevents lens induction. BMP and FGF rescue by downregulating PAX6 to optimal levels, independent of competence or inductive signaling.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation before any attempt at a solution is made.\n\n**Step 1: Extraction of Givens**\n- Core biological principles: The Central Dogma, the definition of tissue competence, and the mechanism of paracrine induction (epithelial-mesenchymal and epithelial-epithelial) via morphogens like Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) and Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), which signal through SMAD and MAPK pathways, respectively.\n- System-specific facts: The preplacodal ectoderm requires Paired Box 6 (PAX6) for competence. The optic vesicle is the source of inductive signals. Induction is reciprocal.\n- Formal logical model:\n    - Competence of preplacodal ectoderm: $P \\in \\{0,1\\}$, where $P=1$ signifies a competent state (PAX6 present, etc.).\n    - Inductive signal presence: $S \\in \\{0,1\\}$, where $S=1$ signifies sufficient BMP and FGF.\n    - Lens placode induction: $L \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\n    - Governing rule: Lens induction occurs if and only if competence and signal are both present, formalized as the logical conjunction $L = P \\land S$.\n- Model assumptions:\n    - The optic vesicle is the principal source of the signal $S$.\n    - PAX6 expression ($P=1$) does not autonomously cause signal generation ($S=1$).\n- Question: Explain, using this model, why removing the optic vesicle prevents lens formation, and why rescue with ectopic BMP/FGF is successful only in PAX6-competent ectoderm ($P=1$) but not in PAX6-negative ectoderm ($P=0$).\n\n**Step 2: Validation of Problem Statement**\nThe problem is well-defined and scientifically grounded. It presents established principles of developmental biology—competence and induction—and correctly identifies key molecular players (PAX6, BMP, FGF) in lens development. It then abstracts these principles into a simple, but rigorously defined, logical model ($L = P \\land S$). The scenarios (wild type, ablation, and rescue experiments) are classic in experimental embryology and directly test the interplay between the model's variables. The problem is self-contained, internally consistent, and free of scientific or logical flaws. It is not trivial, as it requires the correct application of the logical model to reason through biological cause and effect.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe problem asks for an explanation of several experimental outcomes based on the provided logical model, $L = P \\land S$. This equation dictates that for lens induction ($L=1$) to occur, two conditions must be met simultaneously: the ectoderm must be competent ($P=1$) and it must receive an inductive signal ($S=1$). If either condition is not met, the outcome is failure of induction ($L=0$). We will analyze each scenario.\n\n1.  **Intact Wild Type:** In the normal embryo, the preplacodal ectoderm correctly expresses PAX6, rendering it competent. Therefore, the competence variable is $P=1$. The adjacent optic vesicle is present and, as per the givens, is the source of the inductive signals BMP and FGF. Thus, the signal variable is $S=1$. Applying the logical rule:\n    $$L = P \\land S = 1 \\land 1 = 1$$\n    The result is $L=1$, meaning the lens placode is induced. This is the expected wild-type outcome.\n\n2.  **Surgical Removal of the Optic Vesicle:** In this experiment, the ectoderm itself is unperturbed and remains wild-type, so it is PAX6-positive and competent. Thus, $P=1$. However, the optic vesicle, the source of the signal $S$, has been removed. Consequently, the ectoderm receives no inductive signal, and $S=0$. The logical rule yields:\n    $$L = P \\land S = 1 \\land 0 = 0$$\n    The result is $L=0$. No lens placode forms. This correctly explains why removal of the optic vesicle prevents lens formation. The inductive signal is necessary.\n\n3.  **Rescue with Ectopic Signal in PAX6-Competent Ectoderm:** This scenario starts with the optic vesicle removed, but an artificial source of BMP and FGF is supplied. The ectoderm is PAX6-competent, so $P=1$. The ectopic source successfully replaces the optic vesicle's function, providing the necessary signal. Therefore, $S=1$. The logical rule gives:\n    $$L = P \\land S = 1 \\land 1 = 1$$\n    The result is $L=1$. A lens placode is induced. This explains the \"rescue\" phenomenon. The source of the signal is not important, only its presence at the competent tissue.\n\n4.  **Rescue with Ectopic Signal in PAX6-Negative Ectoderm:** Here, the ectoderm has been rendered non-competent by the absence of PAX6, so $P=0$. An ectopic source of BMP and FGF is provided, so the signal is present: $S=1$. Applying the logical rule:\n    $$L = P \\land S = 0 \\land 1 = 0$$\n    The result is $L=0$. No lens placode is induced. This explains why the rescue attempt fails in non-competent tissue. The signal, no matter how strong, cannot induce a response in tissue that is not prepared to receive and interpret it.\n\nIn summary, the logical model $L = P \\land S$ fully and accurately accounts for all experimental observations presented. Lens induction is not a cell-autonomous program nor is it solely dependent on an external signal; it is the product of the interaction between an intrinsic state of competence ($P$) and an extrinsic inductive signal ($S$).\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Once PAX6 is expressed, lens fate is intrinsically cell-autonomous; the optic vesicle is dispensable for induction and only modulates timing. Ectopic BMP and FGF accelerate an internal program that would occur regardless of external cues.**\n    This statement is fundamentally incorrect. It claims lens fate is cell-autonomous after PAX6 expression, which would be modeled as $L=P$. This contradicts the experimental fact that removing the optic vesicle (removing $S$) abolishes lens formation, as well as the problem's core rule $L = P \\land S$. The optic vesicle is not merely modulating timing; it provides a necessary inductive signal.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B. The optic vesicle primarily supplies a permissive mechanical scaffold; without it, the ectoderm cannot invaginate into a lens, but BMP and FGF stiffen the ectoderm sufficiently to mimic the scaffold. Competence is not a limiting factor in this context.**\n    This is a distortion of the established biological principles. The problem defines the optic vesicle's role as a source of paracrine morphogens (BMP, FGF), which activate specific signaling pathways (SMAD, MAPK) to alter gene expression. It is an informational, not a mechanical, process. Furthermore, this option dismisses competence as a limiting factor, which directly contradicts the model ($L = P \\land S$) and the observation that PAX6-negative ectoderm does not form a lens even with signals.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. The optic vesicle supplies necessary and sufficient paracrine inductive cues, including BMP and FGF, that convert a PAX6-positive competent ectoderm into a lens placode; removal eliminates these cues so that $S=0$ and $L=0$. Ectopic BMP and FGF restore $S=1$ and thus $L=1$ only if $P=1$, whereas PAX6-negative ectoderm ($P=0$) cannot respond to $S$ and fails to form a lens.**\n    This statement is a perfect verbal description of the logical consequences of the model $L = P \\land S$ as applied to the given experiments. It correctly identifies the optic vesicle as the source of a necessary signal ($S$). It correctly states that removing the vesicle sets $S=0$, leading to $L=0$. It correctly explains that ectopic signals restore $S=1$, and that this only leads to $L=1$ if and only if $P=1$ (PAX6-competence). This option is fully consistent with the provided principles and logical derivation.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **D. The optic vesicle secretes Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) that represses lens formation; removal of the optic vesicle derepresses the ectoderm, but excess PAX6 prevents lens induction. BMP and FGF rescue by downregulating PAX6 to optimal levels, independent of competence or inductive signaling.**\n    This option introduces extraneous molecules (SHH) and incorrect mechanisms. It proposes a repressive role for the optic vesicle and a convoluted mechanism for BMP/FGF action (regulating PAX6 levels) that is not supported by or mentioned in the problem's foundational principles. The problem framework is based on induction by BMP/FGF, not repression by SHH. This is a fabrication.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2632992"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the basic logic of induction, this problem explores the critical, real-world concept of transcription factor dosage sensitivity.

Which option best captures the expected outcome?\n\nA.

Lens placode induction is variably defective, yielding microphakia or aphakia due to reduced competence of surface ectoderm to respond to BMP and FGF from the optic vesicle and periocular mesenchyme; the olfactory placode is hypoplastic with diminished neurogenesis and hyposmia to anosmia due to reduced responsiveness of anterior pre-placodal ectoderm to FGF $8$ and SHH from the anterior neural ridge and forebrain; justification: lowered PAX6 dosage elevates the effective induction threshold for both placodes, partially preserved by the remaining allele.\n\nC.

Lens placode development is delayed but normal by birth due to compensatory upregulation of SRY-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2), and the olfactory placode is normal because FGF $8$ alone suffices for induction independent of PAX6; justification: placodal induction is determined solely by external signals when present at normal levels.", "solution": "The problem statement will first be subjected to rigorous validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- A vertebrate embryo has haploinsufficiency for Paired box gene 6 (PAX6).\n- Only $1$ functional allele of PAX6 is present.\n- The extracellular inductive milieu is unperturbed.\n- Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) cues from the optic vesicle and periocular tissues are normal.\n- Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) cues from neural and mesenchymal sources are normal.\n- Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) cues from forebrain organizers are normal.\n- The task is to predict the phenotypes for the lens and olfactory placodal systems.\n- The prediction must use first principles of transcription factor dosage, tissue competence, and inductive signaling, with a mechanistic justification based on competence loss and altered induction thresholds.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is evaluated for validity.\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The premise is scientifically sound. PAX6 is a highly conserved, dosage-sensitive master regulatory transcription factor critical for the development of the eye, central nervous system, and other ectodermal placodes, including the olfactory placode. Haploinsufficiency of PAX6 in humans is the cause of aniridia, a condition characterized by iris hypoplasia but also frequently associated with cataracts, microphakia (small lens), and other ocular defects. The roles of BMP, FGF, and SHH as key inductive signals in these regions are well-established facts in developmental biology. The concepts of tissue competence and induction thresholds are fundamental principles of the discipline.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear genetic perturbation (PAX6 haploinsufficiency) and constrains the system by assuming a normal external signaling environment. This allows for a focused analysis of the cell-intrinsic consequences of reduced transcription factor dosage, which is a standard method for dissecting developmental gene function. The question asks for a specific, predictable outcome based on these principles.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, technical language standard to the field of developmental biology. It is free from ambiguity and subjectivity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It presents a classic problem in developmental genetics that is well-grounded in established scientific principles and is structured to be solvable through logical deduction from those principles. I will now proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\nThe core of this problem rests upon the concept of **dosage sensitivity** of a key transcription factor and its effect on **tissue competence**.\n$1$. **Transcription Factor Dosage:** PAX6 is a transcription factor. The rate of transcription of its target genes, and thus the execution of its downstream developmental programs, is dependent on its concentration. Haploinsufficiency implies that the concentration of PAX6 protein is approximately $50\\%$ of the wild-type level.\n$2$. **Tissue Competence:** Competence is the intrinsic ability of a tissue to respond to an external inductive signal. This state is established by the expression of a specific set of transcription factors within the responding cells. For the surface ectoderm to form sensory placodes like the lens and olfactory placodes, it must first be rendered competent. PAX6 is a primary competence factor for the entire pre-placodal ectoderm.\n$3$. **Inductive Thresholds:** For a developmental induction to occur, the strength of the inductive signal received by a competent cell must exceed a specific threshold. The cell's internal state, particularly the concentration of competence factors, modulates this threshold. A lower concentration of a crucial competence factor like PAX6 will elevate the required threshold of the external signal.\n\n**Application to Lens Development:**\nThe surface ectoderm overlying the optic vesicle is induced by a combination of signals, primarily BMPs and FGFs, to form the lens placode. The competence of this ectoderm to respond to these signals is conferred by the expression of PAX6, in combination with other factors like SOX2 and SIX3. With PAX6 levels reduced by half, the competence of the surface ectoderm is compromised. Consequently, the threshold for induction by the normal levels of BMP and FGF is raised. The inductive signal, though present at a normal concentration, may now be insufficient to trigger a full response. This leads to a range of defects, from a smaller-than-normal lens (microphakia) to a complete failure of lens induction (aphakia). The outcome is often variable due to stochastic effects and slight variations in genetic background.\n\n**Application to Olfactory Placode Development:**\nThe anterior pre-placodal ectoderm is specified to become the olfactory placodes under the influence of inductive signals from the adjacent anterior neural ridge (secreting FGF8) and the ventral forebrain (secreting SHH). PAX6 is expressed in this domain and is essential for specifying the olfactory placode territory and for the subsequent development of olfactory sensory neurons. As with the lens, PAX6 haploinsufficiency reduces the competence of this tissue. The reduced responsiveness to normal FGF8 and SHH signals results in a smaller (hypoplastic) olfactory placode. A hypoplastic placode will generate fewer olfactory sensory neurons, leading to a functionally deficient olfactory epithelium, manifesting as a reduced sense of smell (hyposmia) or its complete absence (anosmia).\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation:**\nPAX6 haploinsufficiency decreases tissue competence in both presumptive lens and olfactory ectoderm domains. This raises the effective threshold for induction. Given normal external signaling, the developmental outcome is expected to be hypomorphic defects in both structures: variably defective lens formation and hypoplastic olfactory placodes with subsequent sensory deficits.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Lens placode forms and invaginates normally because Six homeobox 3 (SIX3) compensates for reduced PAX6, while the olfactory placode is expanded because PAX6 normally represses olfactory fate; justification: increased sensitivity to BMP and FGF counters reduced PAX6.**\n- *Analysis:* This option is flawed on multiple grounds. First, complete compensation by SIX3 for a $50\\%$ loss of a master regulator like PAX6 is biologically implausible; the existence of a haploinsufficiency phenotype is, by definition, a failure of compensation. Second, the assertion that PAX6 represses olfactory fate is incorrect; PAX6 is required for olfactory placode specification. Reduced PAX6 would lead to a smaller, not an expanded, placode. Third, the justification of \"increased sensitivity\" is the opposite of the correct principle; reduced competence factor concentration leads to *decreased* sensitivity (a higher induction threshold).\n- *Verdict:* **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Lens placode induction is variably defective, yielding microphakia or aphakia due to reduced competence of surface ectoderm to respond to BMP and FGF from the optic vesicle and periocular mesenchyme; the olfactory placode is hypoplastic with diminished neurogenesis and hyposmia to anosmia due to reduced responsiveness of anterior pre-placodal ectoderm to FGF $8$ and SHH from the anterior neural ridge and forebrain; justification: lowered PAX6 dosage elevates the effective induction threshold for both placodes, partially preserved by the remaining allele.**\n- *Analysis:* This option aligns perfectly with the derivation from first principles. It correctly predicts the hypomorphic phenotypes in both lens (microphakia/aphakia) and olfactory (hypoplasia, hyposmia/anosmia) systems. Most importantly, it provides the correct mechanistic explanation: reduced competence, reduced responsiveness, and an elevated induction threshold due to lowered PAX6 dosage. The mention of partial preservation by the remaining allele correctly explains why the phenotype is not equivalent to a null mutation.\n- *Verdict:* **Correct**.\n\n**C. Both lens and olfactory placodes are unaffected because inductive signals are unchanged; PAX6 haploinsufficiency patterns only neural retina and spares placodal competence.**\n- *Analysis:* This statement fundamentally misunderstands the concept of tissue competence. Development requires both a signal and a competent responding tissue. Normal signals cannot rescue a defect in the responder. The claim that PAX6 spares placodal competence is factually incorrect; PAX6 is a cornerstone of the pre-placodal ectoderm gene regulatory network.\n- *Verdict:* **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Lens placode fate switches to epidermis due to elevated BMP levels, and the olfactory placode converts to a trigeminal placode due to cross-repressive Pax family interactions; justification: PAX6 haploinsufficiency increases BMP ligand production and destabilizes placodal identity.**\n- *Analysis:* The justification is in direct contradiction with the problem statement, which explicitly states that BMP cues are normal. PAX6 is a cell-intrinsic transcription factor and is not expected to regulate BMP production in the optic vesicle. While a failure of induction can result in a default epidermal fate, the reason provided is invalid. The claim of a cell fate switch to a trigeminal placode is overly specific and not the primary, most direct consequence of reduced PAX6. The main effect is a failure to properly induce the olfactory fate.\n- *Verdict:* **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Lens placode development is delayed but normal by birth due to compensatory upregulation of SRY-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2), and the olfactory placode is normal because FGF $8$ alone suffices for induction independent of PAX6; justification: placodal induction is determined solely by external signals when present at normal levels.**\n- *Analysis:* Like option A, this relies on a flawed idea of complete compensation. The clinical reality of PAX6 haploinsufficiency (e.g., congenital cataracts) proves that development is *not* normal by birth. The claim that FGF8 suffices for olfactory induction independent of PAX6 is incorrect; PAX6 is an essential competence factor. The justification that induction is determined solely by external signals is a gross oversimplification and fundamentally wrong, as it ignores the role of the responding tissue's internal state.\n- *Verdict:* **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2633002"}, {"introduction": "This practice challenges you to translate qualitative biological principles into a rigorous quantitative model, a hallmark of modern systems biology.

The assumption of independence between the activator and repressor actions implies that for transcription to occur, the activator must be bound AND the repressor must not be bound.

Taking the `$n`\n-th root, we obtain the closed-form expression for `$F^{*}$`:\n$$\nF^{*} = K_F \\left( \\frac{C}{1-C} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for `$C$` back gives the final analytical solution:\n$$\nF^{*} = K_F \\left( \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{th}} \\left( 1 + \\left(\\frac{B^0}{K_B}\\right)^m \\right)}{1 - p_{\\mathrm{th}} \\left( 1 + \\left(\\frac{B^0}{K_B}\\right)^m \\right)} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}}\n$$\nThis is the first part of the required answer.\n\nNext, we evaluate `$F^{*}$` using the provided numerical parameters: `$n=2$`, `$m=2$`, `$K_F=20$` nM, `$K_B=10$` nM, `$B^0=15$` nM, and `$p_{\\mathrm{th}}=0.25$`.\nFirst, calculate the value of the term `$C$`.\n$$\nC = 0.25 \\left( 1 + \\left(\\frac{15}{10}\\right)^2 \\right) = 0.25 \\left( 1 + (1.5)^2 \\right) = 0.25 (1 + 2.25) = 0.25 \\times 3.25 = 0.8125\n$$\nThe condition `$0 < C < 1$` is satisfied, as `$0.8125 < 1$`. Now we compute `$F^{*}$`:\n$$\nF^{*} = 20 \\left( \\frac{0.8125}{1 - 0.8125} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 20 \\left( \\frac{0.8125}{0.1875} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$\nThe ratio inside the parenthesis is `$\\frac{0.8125}{0.1875} = \\frac{13}{3}$`.\n$$\nF^{*} = 20 \\sqrt{\\frac{13}{3}} \\approx 20 \\sqrt{4.3333...} \\approx 20 \\times 2.08166... \\approx 41.6332...\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the required FGF concentration is `$41.6$` nM.\n\nFinally, we interpret the function `$F^{*}(B)$`. The derived equation for `$F^{*}$` shows it is a monotonically increasing function of the BMP concentration `$B$`. This is because as `$B$` increases, the term `$1 + (B/K_B)^m$` increases, which causes the numerator `$C(B)$` to increase and the denominator `$1-C(B)$` to decrease, leading to a rapid increase of the overall fraction and thus of `$F^{*}$`.\nThis function `$F^{*}(B)$` defines the boundary of PPE specification in the concentration space of the two morphogens. In the embryo, FGF and BMP often form opposing gradients. For a cell to adopt a PPE fate, its local FGF concentration must exceed the threshold `$F^{*}$`, which is set by its local BMP concentration.\nThe anterior-lateral limits of the PPE domain correspond to the spatial contour where the local FGF level, `$F(\\vec{x})$`, is just equal to the required threshold, `$F^{*}(B(\\vec{x}))$`. Anterior to this boundary, BMP levels are typically higher and FGF levels are lower. Because `$F^{*}(B)$` rises with `$B$`, the falling FGF concentration is insufficient to overcome the stronger BMP-mediated repression, and `$F(\\vec{x}) < F^{*}(B(\\vec{x}))$`. Consequently, the PPE effector gene is not expressed, and the tissue adopts an alternative fate (e.g., surface ectoderm or neural crest). This mechanism of cross-repression, quantified by `$F^{*}(B)$`, is thus critical for carving out a precisely demarcated PPE domain from the cranial ectoderm.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{41.6}\n$$", "id": "2632994"}]}
