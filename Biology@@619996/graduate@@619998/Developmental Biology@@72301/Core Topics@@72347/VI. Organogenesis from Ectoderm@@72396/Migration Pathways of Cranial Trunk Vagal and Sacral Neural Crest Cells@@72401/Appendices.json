A well-tested observation is that this segmental restriction yields one DRG condensation per somite in the trunk, provided that the anteroposterior polarity of the somite is intact and that condensations are counted where the trunk neural crest cells contribute, excluding cranial, vagal, and sacral domains.\n\nConsider a model trunk domain defined along the anteroposterior axis with total length $L = 10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.

First, a critical validation of the problem statement is necessary.\n\n**Problem Validation:**\n1.  **Givens Extraction**:\n    - Total length of the trunk domain: $L = 10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    - Somite center-to-center distance, representing the length of a single segmental period: $s = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    - Biological premise: One DRG condensation forms per somite in the trunk. Let $N_{DRG}$ be the number of DRGs and $N_{somites}$ be the number of somites. The premise is $N_{DRG} = N_{somites}$.\n    - Boundary Condition: The domain starts and ends at somite boundaries, meaning the total length $L$ is an integer multiple of the somite period length $s$. There are no partial somites.\n    - Exclusions: Contributions from cranial, vagal, and sacral neural crest cells are outside the domain. Secondary modifications like fusion or apoptosis are to be ignored.\n\n2.  **Validation Verdict**: The problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of developmental biology, specifically the segmental organization of the peripheral nervous system. The one-to-one correspondence between trunk somites and DRGs is a well-established observation. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data ($L$ and $s$) and a critical boundary condition that eliminates ambiguity. The values are biologically plausible. The problem is not trivial in a pedagogical sense, as it demands the translation of a biological description into a mathematical model, a fundamental skill in quantitative science. The problem is deemed **valid**.\n\n**Solution Derivation:**\nThe core of the problem lies in the quantitative application of the biological principle of segmentation. The number of DRG condensations, denoted as $N_{DRG}$, is stated to be equal to the number of somites, $N_{somites}$, within the defined trunk domain.\n$$ N_{DRG} = N_{somites} $$\nThus, the task reduces to calculating the number of somites within the trunk domain.\n\nThe trunk domain is defined by its total length, $L = 10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The somites are described as periodic structures, with a repeating interval (center-to-center distance) of $s = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. This parameter $s$ represents the length of one complete segmental unit.\n\nThe instruction to find the \"number of full periods accommodated within $L$\" translates to calculating how many times the segmental length $s$ fits into the total length $L$. This is a simple division:\n$$ N_{somites} = \\frac{L}{s} $$\nThe problem provides a crucial simplifying assumption: \"The rostral and caudal boundaries of the trunk domain coincide with somite boundaries, so there are no partial somites at the edges.\" This condition ensures that the total length $L$ is an exact integer multiple of the segmental length $s$. Consequently, the ratio $\\frac{L}{s}$ will yield an integer result, and there is no need to consider floor or ceiling functions to handle incomplete segments at the boundaries.\n\nSubstituting the provided values into the equation:\n$$ L = 10\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\n$$ s = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\nThe number of somites is calculated as:\n$$ N_{somites} = \\frac{10}{0.4} $$\nTo perform the division without a calculator, we can express the denominator as a fraction:\n$$ N_{somites} = \\frac{10}{\\frac{4}{10}} = \\frac{10 \\times 10}{4} = \\frac{100}{4} $$\n$$ N_{somites} = 25 $$\nThe result is a dimensionless integer, as expected for a count. The units of millimeters in the numerator and denominator cancel.\n\nAccording to the foundational biological premise of the problem, the number of DRG condensations is equal to the number of somites.\n$$ N_{DRG} = N_{somites} = 25 $$\nTherefore, the expected number of DRG condensations within the specified trunk domain is $25$.

It presents a standard biophysical model, the Persistent Random Walk (PRW), and its corresponding Mean Squared Displacement ($\\mathrm{MSD}$) function, which is widely used to analyze cell migration data. The questions posed are a direct application and a conceptual analysis of this model, both of which are standard exercises in quantitative biology. All necessary information is provided. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe Mean Squared Displacement is given by the expression:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(t) = 2v^{2}\\tau^{2}\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau} - 1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nwhere $v$ is the constant speed of the cell, $\\tau$ is the persistence time, and $t$ is time.\n\n(i) We are required to compute the value of $\\mathrm{MSD}(t)$ at the specific time $t = 3\\tau$.

The term linear in time becomes $\\frac{3\\tau}{\\tau} = 3$.\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\mathrm{MSD}(t)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(3\\tau) = 2v^{2}\\tau^{2}\\left(\\frac{3\\tau}{\\tau} - 1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3\\tau}{\\tau}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(3\\tau) = 2v^{2}\\tau^{2}\\left(3 - 1 + \\exp(-3)\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the terms inside the parentheses gives:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(3\\tau) = 2v^{2}\\tau^{2}\\left(2 + \\exp(-3)\\right)\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the $\\mathrm{MSD}$ at $t=3\\tau$.\nFor the interpretation of units, the speed $v$ has units of length over time (e.g., $\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}$), and the persistence time $\\tau$ has units of time (e.g., $\\mathrm{s}$). Therefore, the product $v^{2}\\tau^{2}$ has units of $(\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s})^{2}(\\mathrm{s})^{2} = \\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}$. The term in the parentheses, $2 + \\exp(-3)$, is a dimensionless number. Consequently, the $\\mathrm{MSD}$ has units of length squared, which is $\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}$ in the context of cell microscopy, as expected for a squared displacement.\n\n(ii) The inference of the parameters $v$ and $\\tau$ from experimental trajectory data relies on the analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the $\\mathrm{MSD}(t)$ function in two distinct time regimes. We start from the provided formula without introducing new principles.\n\nFirst, consider the short-time regime, where $t \\ll \\tau$. In this limit, the ratio $x = t/\\tau$ is very small. We can use the Taylor series expansion for the exponential function around $x=0$: $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1 - x + \\frac{x^{2}}{2!} - O(x^{3})$.\nSubstituting this into the $\\mathrm{MSD}$ formula:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(t) \\approx 2v^{2}\\tau^{2}\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau} - 1 + \\left(1 - \\frac{t}{\\tau} + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)^{2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThe linear and constant terms cancel out:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(t) \\approx 2v^{2}\\tau^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{t^{2}}{\\tau^{2}}\\right) = v^{2}t^{2}\n$$\nThis is the ballistic regime, where $\\mathrm{MSD}(t) \\propto t^{2}$. Over short timescales, the cell's motion is nearly a straight line, and the displacement is simply speed multiplied by time, so the squared displacement is $(vt)^{2}$. By fitting the initial part of an experimentally determined $\\mathrm{MSD}$ curve to the function $A t^{2}$, one can determine $v = \\sqrt{A}$.\n\nSecond, consider the long-time regime, where $t \\gg \\tau$. In this limit, the term $\\exp(-t/\\tau)$ approaches zero.\nThe $\\mathrm{MSD}$ formula simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(t) \\approx 2v^{2}\\tau^{2}\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau} - 1\\right) = 2v^{2}\\tau t - 2v^{2}\\tau^{2}\n$$\nFor sufficiently large $t$, the term linear in $t$ dominates, and we have:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(t) \\approx 2v^{2}\\tau t\n$$\nThis is the diffusive regime, where $\\mathrm{MSD}(t) \\propto t$. This is analogous to a random walk where the effective diffusion coefficient is $D_{\\mathrm{eff}} = v^{2}\\tau$. By fitting the later, linear part of the experimental $\\mathrm{MSD}$ curve to a function $B t$, one can determine the product $B = 2v^{2}\\tau$.\n\nThe procedure to infer $v$ and $\\tau$ is therefore:\n1.  From experimental trajectories, calculate the ensemble-averaged $\\mathrm{MSD}(t)$.\n2.  Fit the short-time data ($t \\ll \\tau$) to $\\mathrm{MSD}(t)=v^{2}t^{2}$ to extract the cell speed $v$.\n3.  Fit the long-time data ($t \\gg \\tau$) to $\\mathrm{MSD}(t)=2v^{2}\\tau t$ to extract the product $2v^{2}\\tau$.\n4.  Using the value of $v$ from step $2$, solve for the persistence time $\\tau$ from the result of step $3$. The crossover time between the ballistic ($t^2$) and diffusive ($t^1$) regimes on a log-log plot also provides a direct estimate for $\\tau$.\n\nDifferences in the migratory pathways (cranial, trunk, vagal, sacral) are due to variations in the microenvironment, including the composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the presence of molecular guidance cues. These variations would manifest as measurable differences in the inferred parameters $v$ and $\\tau$.\n-   **Differences in Speed ($v$)**: The parameter $v$ represents the instantaneous speed of the cell. This is influenced by the cell's intrinsic motile machinery and its interaction with the physical substrate. A pathway with a high density of adhesive ECM proteins (e.g., fibronectin) might permit higher speeds, while a physically cluttered or less adhesive environment could reduce $v$. Thus, comparing $v$ across pathways would reveal differences in the physical nature of the substrate and its permissiveness to movement.\n-   **Differences in Persistence ($\\tau$)**: The parameter $\\tau$ reflects the timescale over which the cell \"remembers\" its direction of motion. This is strongly influenced by guidance cues. A pathway with a strong, stable gradient of a chemoattractant would cause cells to maintain their direction for longer, resulting in a large $\\tau$. Conversely, a pathway with inhibitory signals or a chaotic arrangement of cues would force cells to reorient frequently, leading to a small $\\tau$. Therefore, comparing $\\tau$ across the cranial, trunk, vagal, and sacral pathways would provide quantitative insight into the strength and nature of the directional guidance mechanisms that define each specific route.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2v^{2}\\tau^{2}\\left(2 + \\exp(-3)\\right)}$$", "id": "2653138"}, {"introduction": "The final challenge is to understand how the behaviors of many individual cells give rise to a collective, organ-level phenomenon.
