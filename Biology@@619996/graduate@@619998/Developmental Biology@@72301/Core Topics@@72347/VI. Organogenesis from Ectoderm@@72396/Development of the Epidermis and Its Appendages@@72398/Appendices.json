A well-supported view is that the number of dermal papilla cells, $N$, sets the intensity of pro-anagen paracrine cues (for example, Wingless/Integrated (Wnt), Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), and inhibition of Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP)), and that anagen entry occurs when signaling surpasses a quantitative threshold integrated over time by the epithelial niche. In many receptor–ligand systems with cooperative integration, the dose–response is graded and sigmoidal. For the purposes of this problem, adopt the following assumptions grounded in standard receptor occupancy theory and stochastic event timing:\n\n- The instantaneous hazard (per-unit-time rate) of anagen entry during telogen, $k(N)$, increases with $N$ according to a Hill-type dose–response: \n$$\nk(N) \\;=\\; k_{\\max}\\,\\frac{N^h}{K^h + N^h},\n$$\nwhere $k_{\\max}$ is the maximal anagen-entry rate, $K$ is the cell-number at half-maximal rate, and $h$ is the Hill coefficient capturing cooperativity of niche signal integration.\n\n- Telogen exit is a memoryless event with hazard $k(N)$; thus, the expected telogen duration is $E[T_{\\mathrm{tel}}] = 1/k(N)$.\n\n- The anagen duration is taken to be approximately independent of $N$ in this regime, with a baseline value $T_{\\mathrm{ana}}$; therefore the expected cycle length is $E[T_{\\mathrm{cycle}}] = E[T_{\\mathrm{tel}}] + T_{\\mathrm{ana}}$.\n\nConsider a follicle with baseline dermal papilla cell number $N_0 = 80$, and parameters $k_{\\max} = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$, $K = 60$, $h = 3$, and $T_{\\mathrm{ana}} = 20$ days.

Baseline Condition ($N_0 = 80$)**\n\nFirst, calculate the hazard rate for anagen entry, $k(N_0)$.\n$$k(N_0) = k(80) = (0.2\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1})\\,\\frac{80^3}{60^3 + 80^3}$$\n$$k(80) = 0.2 \\times \\frac{512000}{216000 + 512000} = 0.2 \\times \\frac{512000}{728000} = 0.2 \\times \\frac{512}{728}$$\nSimplifying the fraction gives $\\frac{512}{728} = \\frac{64}{91}$.\n$$k(80) = 0.2 \\times \\frac{64}{91} = \\frac{12.8}{91} \\approx 0.140659\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$$\nThe value is approximately $0.141\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$.\n\nSecond, calculate the expected telogen duration, $E[T_{\\mathrm{tel}}(N_0)]$.\n$$E[T_{\\mathrm{tel}}(N_0)] = \\frac{1}{k(80)} = \\frac{91}{12.8} = 7.109375\\,\\mathrm{days}$$\nThe value is approximately $7.1\\,\\mathrm{days}$.\n\nThird, calculate the expected total cycle length, $E[T_{\\mathrm{cycle}}(N_0)]$.\n$$E[T_{\\mathrm{cycle}}(N_0)] = E[T_{\\mathrm{tel}}(N_0)] + T_{\\mathrm{ana}} = 7.109375\\,\\mathrm{days} + 20\\,\\mathrm{days} = 27.109375\\,\\mathrm{days}$$\nThe value is approximately $27.1\\,\\mathrm{days}$.\n\n**2. Perturbed Condition ($N_1 = 40$)**\n\nFirst, calculate the new hazard rate for anagen entry, $k(N_1)$.\n$$k(N_1) = k(40) = (0.2\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1})\\,\\frac{40^3}{60^3 + 40^3}$$\n$$k(40) = 0.2 \\times \\frac{64000}{216000 + 64000} = 0.2 \\times \\frac{64000}{280000} = 0.2 \\times \\frac{64}{280}$$\nSimplifying the fraction gives $\\frac{64}{280} = \\frac{8}{35}$.\n$$k(40) = 0.2 \\times \\frac{8}{35} = \\frac{1.6}{35} \\approx 0.045714\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$$\nThe value is approximately $0.0457\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$.\n\nSecond, calculate the new expected telogen duration, $E[T_{\\mathrm{tel}}(N_1)]$.\n$$E[T_{\\mathrm{tel}}(N_1)] = \\frac{1}{k(40)} = \\frac{35}{1.6} = 21.875\\,\\mathrm{days}$$\nThe value is approximately $21.9\\,\\mathrm{days}$.\n\nThird, calculate the new expected total cycle length, $E[T_{\\mathrm{cycle}}(N_1)]$.\n$$E[T_{\\mathrm{cycle}}(N_1)] = E[T_{\\mathrm{tel}}(N_1)] + T_{\\mathrm{ana}} = 21.875\\,\\mathrm{days} + 20\\,\\mathrm{days} = 41.875\\,\\mathrm{days}$$\nThe value is approximately $41.9\\,\\mathrm{days}$.\n\n**3. Percentage Increase in Cycle Length**\n\nThe percentage increase is calculated as:\n$$\\%\\,\\text{increase} = \\frac{E[T_{\\mathrm{cycle}}(N_1)] - E[T_{\\mathrm{cycle}}(N_0)]}{E[T_{\\mathrm{cycle}}(N_0)]} \\times 100\\%$$\n$$\\%\\,\\text{increase} = \\frac{41.875 - 27.109375}{27.109375} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{14.765625}{27.109375} \\times 100\\% \\approx 54.466\\%$$\nThis is roughly a $54\\%$ increase.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The cooperative, sigmoidal dose–response imposes a quantitative threshold near $K$; reducing $N$ from $80$ to $40$ drops $k(N)$ from approximately $0.141\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$ to $0.0457\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$, lengthening expected telogen from about $7.1$ to $21.9$ days and the total cycle from about $27.1$ to $41.9$ days (an increase of roughly $54\\%$).**\nThe statement that a Hill function with $h=3$ represents a cooperative, sigmoidal dose-response imposing a quantitative (or \"soft\") threshold is correct. The function rises steeply around $N=K$, meaning small changes in $N$ in this region cause large changes in the rate $k(N)$. Our calculations confirm all numerical values presented: $k(80) \\approx 0.141\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$, $k(40) \\approx 0.0457\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$, $E[T_{\\mathrm{tel}}(80)] \\approx 7.1\\,\\mathrm{days}$, $E[T_{\\mathrm{tel}}(40)] \\approx 21.9\\,\\mathrm{days}$, $E[T_{\\mathrm{cycle}}(80)] \\approx 27.1\\,\\mathrm{days}$, $E[T_{\\mathrm{cycle}}(40)] \\approx 41.9\\,\\mathrm{days}$, and the percentage increase is approximately $54\\%$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Because anagen entry rate scales linearly with dermal papilla size, halving $N$ doubles telogen from about $7.1$ to $14.2$ days; the total cycle thus increases from about $27.1$ to $34.2$ days.**\nThe premise \"anagen entry rate scales linearly with dermal papilla size\" is fundamentally incorrect. The governing equation is a non-linear, sigmoidal Hill function. A linear model would be $k(N) = cN$ for some constant $c$. The subsequent numerical claims are based on this false premise and are inconsistent with the provided model. For instance, halving $N$ from $80$ to $40$ reduces $k(N)$ by a factor of $\\frac{k(40)}{k(80)} = \\frac{0.0457}{0.141} \\approx 0.32$, not $0.5$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The cycle length is largely determined by anagen duration; halving $N$ has negligible effect on timing because $T_{\\mathrm{ana}}$ dominates, so the cycle remains near $27$ days.**\nWhile $T_{\\mathrm{ana}}$ is a significant component of the cycle, the change in telogen duration is substantial. $E[T_{\\mathrm{tel}}]$ triples from $7.1$ to $21.9$ days. This causes the total cycle length to increase by over $50\\%$, from $27.1$ to $41.9$ days. An increase of nearly $15$ days is by no means a \"negligible effect\". The conclusion that the cycle remains near $27$ days is demonstrably false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. There is a hard threshold at $K$ dermal papilla cells; reducing $N$ below $K$ prevents anagen entirely, so telogen becomes indefinitely long and the follicle arrests.**\nThis option misinterprets the nature of the Hill function. It describes a smooth, sigmoidal transition, not a \"hard\" or step-function threshold. For any $N > 0$, the hazard rate $k(N)$ is a finite, non-zero value. At $N_1 = 40$ (which is below $K=60$), we calculated $k(40) \\approx 0.0457\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1} > 0$. Anagen is not prevented; it is merely delayed. The expected telogen duration is finite ($21.9$ days), not \"indefinitely long\". Follicle arrest would imply $k(N) = 0$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2628336"}]}
