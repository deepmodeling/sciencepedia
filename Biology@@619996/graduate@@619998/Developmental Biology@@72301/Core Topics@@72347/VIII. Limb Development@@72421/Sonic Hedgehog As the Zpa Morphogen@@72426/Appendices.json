[@problem_id:2673162]", "problem": "A vertebrate limb bud exhibits patterning along the anterior–posterior axis under the influence of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), secreted from the posterior Zone of Polarizing Activity (ZPA). Consider the concentration field of Shh, denoted by $c(x,t)$, where $x$ is position along the anterior–posterior axis and $t$ is time. Use as foundational starting points: (i) Fick’s first law of diffusion, which states that the diffusive flux is $J_{\\mathrm{diff}} = -D \\nabla c$ for an effective diffusivity $D$, (ii) local conservation of mass for Shh, which states that $\\partial_t c + \\nabla \\cdot J = R$, where $R$ is the net local production minus removal rate, and (iii) linear first-order removal kinetics in the unsaturated regime so that the removal rate is proportional to $c$ with rate constant $k$, together with a prescribed, spatially localized source density $S(x)$ corresponding to the ZPA. Based only on these foundational ingredients, and without introducing additional transport mechanisms or nonlinearities that have not been justified from this base, select the option that correctly gives the governing partial differential equation for $c(x,t)$ and a scientifically consistent, minimal set of assumptions under which it applies to the limb bud context.\n\nA. Equation: $\\partial_t c(x,t) = D \\nabla^2 c(x,t) - k\\,c(x,t) + S(x)$. Assumptions: Effective diffusion in extracellular space is isotropic with spatially uniform $D$ at the scale of interest; removal is first-order with constant $k$ reflecting receptor-mediated uptake and degradation in an unsaturated regime; the ZPA acts as a localized, stationary source so that $S(x)$ is nonzero only near the posterior margin and time-independent over the window of gradient establishment; limb bud geometry can be approximated as one-dimensional along the anterior–posterior axis with $0$-flux boundaries at tissue edges; advection and growth-dilution are negligible during the time scale of gradient formation.\n\nB.

The solution requires a critical validation of the problem statement, followed by a derivation of the equation and a systematic evaluation of the provided options.\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of transport phenomena and developmental biology, specifically the reaction-diffusion model for morphogen gradient formation. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains the necessary information to derive the governing equation.\n\nThe derivation proceeds as follows, based only on the provided foundational ingredients:\n\n1.  **Mass Conservation**: The starting point is the local conservation of mass for Shh, given as ingredient (ii):\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot J = R $$\n    where $c$ is the concentration, $J$ is the total flux, and $R$ is the net rate of production minus removal per unit volume.\n\n2.  **Flux Term**: The problem specifies Fick's first law for the diffusive flux, ingredient (i), as $J_{\\mathrm{diff}} = -D \\nabla c$. The problem asks to derive the equation *only* from the given ingredients, which do not include other transport mechanisms like advection. Therefore, the total flux $J$ is assumed to be purely diffusive:\n    $$ J = J_{\\mathrm{diff}} = -D \\nabla c $$\n\n3.  **Net Rate Term**: The net rate $R$ is given as production minus removal. Ingredient (iv) specifies a spatially localized source density $S(x)$. Ingredient (iii) specifies linear first-order removal kinetics, meaning the removal rate is $k c$ for some rate constant $k$. Thus, the net rate is:\n    $$ R = S(x) - k c $$\n\n4.  **Assembly of the PDE**: Substituting the expressions for $J$ and $R$ into the conservation equation yields:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (-D \\nabla c) = S(x) - k c $$\n    Rearranging the terms gives the general form of the reaction-diffusion equation:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot (D \\nabla c) - k c + S(x) $$\n    This is the most general equation derivable from the given principles.\n\n5.  **Simplification under Assumption**: To arrive at the specific form presented in several options, we must make an assumption about the effective diffusivity $D$. If the medium (the extracellular matrix of the limb bud) is assumed to be isotropic (diffusion is the same in all directions) and homogeneous (diffusion properties are the same everywhere), then $D$ is a scalar constant. In this case, the divergence term simplifies:\n    $$ \\nabla \\cdot (D \\nabla c) = D \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla c) = D \\nabla^2 c $$\n    where $\\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator. The governing equation then becomes:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial c(x,t)}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla^2 c(x,t) - k c(x,t) + S(x) $$\n    This equation describes how the concentration of Shh changes in time and space due to diffusion, degradation, and production. To apply it to the limb bud, one must also assume that any other potential biological processes, such as advection due to cell movement or dilution due to tissue growth, are negligible on the time scale of gradient formation.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Equation: $\\partial_t c(x,t) = D \\nabla^2 c(x,t) - k\\,c(x,t) + S(x)$. Assumptions: Effective diffusion in extracellular space is isotropic with spatially uniform $D$ at the scale of interest; removal is first-order with constant $k$ reflecting receptor-mediated uptake and degradation in an unsaturated regime; the ZPA acts as a localized, stationary source so that $S(x)$ is nonzero only near the posterior margin and time-independent over the window of gradient establishment; limb bud geometry can be approximated as one-dimensional along the anterior–posterior axis with $0$-flux boundaries at tissue edges; advection and growth-dilution are negligible during the time scale of gradient formation.**\n\nThis option presents the correct equation, consistent with our derivation under the assumption of a constant, scalar diffusivity $D$. The listed assumptions are precisely the ones required to justify this specific form of the equation and its application to the limb bud context.\n- The assumption of isotropic and uniform $D$ justifies the use of the Laplacian operator $D \\nabla^2 c$.\n- The assumption of first-order removal justifies the $-k c$ term, as per ingredient (iii).\n- The assumption of a localized, stationary source $S(x)$ is consistent with ingredient (iv) and the biology of the ZPA.\n- The geometric approximation and boundary conditions are standard and reasonable for this type of model.\n- The assumption that advection and growth are negligible is necessary to exclude additional terms from the equation, in accordance with the problem's strict constraint to use only the provided ingredients.\nAll components are logically sound and consistent.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Equation: $\\partial_t c(x,t) = -D \\nabla^2 c(x,t) - k\\,c(x,t) + S(x)$. Assumptions: The negative sign in front of $D \\nabla^2 c$ arises from diffusion driving molecules down their concentration gradient; the ZPA produces Shh uniformly across the limb bud so that $S(x)$ can be taken spatially constant; sink terms include both degradation and irreversible binding lumped into $k$.**\n\nThe equation is fundamentally incorrect. The diffusion term, which describes the spreading of a substance, must have a positive sign. A concentration maximum corresponds to a negative Laplacian ($\\nabla^2 c < 0$). Diffusion must cause this maximum to decrease over time ($\\partial_t c < 0$). For this to hold, the diffusion term must be of the form $+D \\nabla^2 c$. A term of $-D \\nabla^2 c$ would lead to anti-diffusion and unstable, unphysical behavior. The justification provided for the negative sign is erroneous. Furthermore, the assumption that the source $S(x)$ is spatially constant contradicts the problem statement that the ZPA is a *localized* source.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Equation (steady state only): $0 = D \\nabla^2 c(x) + k\\,c(x) + S(x)$. Assumptions: The decay is effectively zero-order due to receptor saturation, but is approximated as first-order via $k$; the gradient is established instantaneously relative to tissue dynamics, justifying a time-independent equation.**\n\nThe equation is incorrect. While setting $\\partial_t c = 0$ correctly moves to the steady state, the removal term is written as $+k c(x)$. A removal or degradation process must act as a sink, decreasing the concentration. Therefore, its sign in the equation must be negative, as in $-k c(x)$. The correct steady-state equation is $0 = D \\nabla^2 c(x) - k c(x) + S(x)$. Additionally, the assumption mentions zero-order kinetics due to saturation, which contradicts the problem's explicit instruction to use \"linear first-order removal kinetics\".\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Equation: $\\partial_t c(x,t) = \\nabla \\cdot \\big(D \\nabla c(x,t)\\big) - k\\,c(x,t) + S(x)$ with $D$ treated as a scalar constant in the equation. Assumptions: Transport is strongly anisotropic due to cytoneme-mediated delivery, so $D$ is effectively a tensor with different values along and across the anterior–posterior axis; degradation is saturating but can be approximated by a single constant $k$; posterior boundary is held at fixed concentration $c = 0$ while the anterior is $0$-flux.**\n\nThis option is rife with contradictions. It presents the general form for the diffusion term, $\\nabla \\cdot (D \\nabla c)$, but then states $D$ is treated as a scalar constant, which is a confusing way to state the simplified equation. More critically, it assumes transport is \"strongly anisotropic,\" which would require $D$ to be a tensor, contradicting the claim that $D$ is a scalar constant. The boundary condition $c=0$ at the posterior margin, where the source (ZPA) is located, is biologically nonsensical. The source should create a high concentration in its vicinity, not a zero-concentration boundary.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Equation: $\\partial_t c(x,t) = D \\nabla^2 c(x,t) - k\\,c(x,t) + S(x) - \\nabla \\cdot \\big(\\mathbf{v}\\, c(x,t)\\big)$. Assumptions: Tissue growth and cell movements contribute advection with velocity field $\\mathbf{v}$ that is comparable to diffusion, so advection cannot be neglected; diffusion is isotropic and $D$ is uniform; degradation is first-order; the ZPA source is stationary and localized in space.**\n\nThis option introduces an advection term, $-\\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{v} c)$. The problem explicitly states that the derivation should be based *only* on the provided foundational ingredients and \"without introducing additional transport mechanisms\". Advection is such an additional mechanism. While advection due to growth can be important in some developmental systems, including it here violates the constraints of the problem. The task is to build the model from the given pieces, not to propose a more complex, albeit potentially more realistic, model.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on this analysis, only option A presents a correctly derived equation accompanied by a consistent and sufficient set of assumptions that align with the problem's premises.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2673162"}, {"introduction": "A powerful model not only describes a system but also makes testable predictions.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in quantitative biology. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe steady-state balance between Fickian diffusion and first-order decay in a one-dimensional domain is described by the following ordinary differential equation:\n$$D \\frac{d^2 C(x)}{dx^2} - k C(x) = 0$$\nwhere $C(x)$ is the concentration of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) at position $x$, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $k$ is the clearance rate constant. This equation can be rewritten as:\n$$\\frac{d^2 C(x)}{dx^2} - \\frac{k}{D} C(x) = 0$$\nWe define the length constant, $\\lambda$, as $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$. This is the answer to the first part of the problem's query, \"derive how the length constant $\\lambda$ depends on $D$ and $k$\". Substituting $\\lambda$ into the equation gives:\n$$\\frac{d^2 C(x)}{dx^2} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} C(x) = 0$$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients. The general solution is:\n$$C(x) = A \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) + B \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nWe apply the boundary conditions to find the constants $A$ and $B$. The problem provides a constant concentration $C_0$ at the posterior boundary, $x=0$:\n$$C(0) = C_0 = A \\exp(0) + B \\exp(0) = A + B$$\nA second condition is required. As the morphogen diffuses away from the source at $x=0$ into the tissue, its concentration must decrease. The term $A \\exp(x/\\lambda)$ represents a concentration that grows exponentially with distance, which is physically unrealistic in this context. Therefore, we must set $A=0$. This is equivalent to assuming a semi-infinite domain, a standard simplification for such models where the tissue length is much larger than the decay length.\nWith $A=0$, we have $B=C_0$. The concentration profile is thus an exponential decay:\n$$C(x) = C_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nNow we analyze the effect of the perturbation. The baseline state has a clearance rate $k_0$, and its corresponding length constant is $\\lambda_0 = \\sqrt{D/k_0}$.\nThe perturbation doubles the clearance rate to $k' = 2k_0$. The new length constant, $\\lambda'$, is:\n$$\\lambda' = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k'}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{2k_0}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k_0}} = \\frac{\\lambda_0}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nThe fold-change $R$ is the ratio of the new length constant to the baseline length constant:\n$$R = \\frac{\\lambda'}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{\\lambda_0 / \\sqrt{2}}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nNumerically, rounding to four significant figures:\n$$R \\approx 0.7071$$\nNext, we compute the number of digits, $N'$, after the perturbation. According to the problem, digits form in the contiguous region where the Shh concentration is above a threshold $T_{\\min}$. The length of this region, $S'$, is determined by the position $x_{thresh}$ where the concentration drops to $T_{\\min}$.

It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of morphogen gradients and gene regulation, well-posed with sufficient data and a clear objective, and formulated with objective, precise language. It contains two parts: first, the design of a biophysical experiment, and second, the mathematical analysis of data that would be obtained from such an experiment. I will address each in turn.\n\nFirst, the experimental design for quantifying messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) distributions using single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH).\n\n(i) The design of probes for detecting $Shh$, $Ptch1$, and $Hhip$ mRNA is critical for specificity and signal-to-noise ratio. A set of approximately $20$ to $50$ short oligonucleotide probes, each about $20$ nucleotides in length, should be designed to tile the coding sequence of each target mRNA. Each oligonucleotide is conjugated to a fluorescent dye. The use of multiple probes for a single mRNA molecule ensures that the cumulative signal is bright and robust against non-hybridization of a few individual probes. Spectrally distinct fluorophores must be used for each gene ($Shh$, $Ptch1$, $Hhip$) to allow simultaneous visualization. Probe validation is non-negotiable. First, *in silico* validation using BLAST against the organism's transcriptome must confirm that probe sequences are unique to their target and lack significant off-target binding sites. Thermodynamic properties such as melting temperature and potential for self-dimerization must also be optimized. Second, *in situ* validation is required. Probes must be tested on tissue from wild-type animals, where they should produce a signal in the expected anatomical location (e.g., $Shh$ in the posterior limb bud), and on tissue from null-mutant animals for a given gene, where the signal must be reduced to background levels. This constitutes a proper positive and negative control.\n\n(ii) For tissue preparation and imaging geometry, embryonic limb buds (e.g., from mouse at embryonic day $10.5$) must be dissected and fixed, typically with $4\\%$ paraformaldehyde, to preserve morphology and RNA integrity. The tissue is then cryoprotected, embedded, and sectioned. The orientation of sectioning is paramount. To analyze the one-dimensional gradient along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis, the limb bud must be sectioned perpendicularly to this axis. This produces a series of thin ($10-20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) transverse sections, each corresponding to a specific A-P coordinate, $x$. The posterior margin of the limb bud, which contains the Zone of Polarizing Activity (ZPA), an anatomically identifiable structure, serves as the origin, $x=0$. Imaging of these sections via multichannel confocal microscopy allows for the acquisition of high-resolution three-dimensional stacks.\n\n(iii) Single-cell segmentation and molecule counting are required to extract quantitative data. A nuclear stain (such as DAPI) or a membrane stain must be included in the protocol. This allows for computational segmentation of the images to identify the boundaries of individual cells. Within each segmented cell, individual fluorescent spots, representing single mRNA molecules, are detected using specialized algorithms that identify local intensity maxima above a background threshold. The brightness and size of these spots should conform to the characteristic point spread function of the microscope. The efficiency of mRNA detection is never $100\\%$. This detection efficiency must be estimated, for example by comparing mean smFISH counts to bulk measurements from quantitative PCR on sorted cells, or by analyzing the intensity distribution of detected spots. While we will assume constant efficiency, acknowledging and calibrating for it is part of a rigorous experimental design.\n\n(iv) An empirical estimate for the basal level of target-gene transcription ($Ptch1$, $Hhip$) is essential for isolating the signal-dependent component of the response. This is achieved by inhibiting the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Embryonic limb buds can be cultured *ex vivo* in the presence of a specific small-molecule inhibitor of Smoothened, such as cyclopamine or SANT-1. After a sufficient period of incubation to reach a new steady state, the tissues are fixed and processed for smFISH as described. The mean mRNA count per cell, averaged over the entire tissue where the gradient has been abolished, provides the background-subtracted basal levels, $b_{\\mathrm{Ptch1}}$ and $b_{\\mathrm{Hhip}}$.\n\n(v) To map the gradient, sampling must be performed at defined distances from the posterior border. For each tissue section, its distance $x$ from the posterior edge ($x=0$) is measured. Within each section, the mean number of mRNA molecules per cell, $m(x)$, is computed by averaging the counts from all segmented cells. By analyzing a series of sections, one obtains a profile of mean mRNA count as a function of distance along the A-P axis, $m(x)$. This provides the raw data for fitting the theoretical model.\n\nNext, we perform the quantitative analysis.\nThe problem states that the steady-state concentration of Shh protein, $c(x)$, along the A-P axis ($x>0$) follows the reaction-diffusion equation:\n$$D\\,\\frac{d^{2}c}{dx^{2}}-k\\,c(x)=0$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $k$ is the first-order removal rate. The general solution to this second-order ordinary differential equation is:\n$$c(x) = A\\exp\\left(x\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right) + B\\exp\\left(-x\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)$$\nA physically meaningful solution for a morphogen gradient sourced at or near $x=0$ must not diverge as $x \\to \\infty$. Therefore, the coefficient $A$ of the exponentially growing term must be zero. This yields:\n$$c(x) = B\\exp\\left(-x\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)$$\nThe spatial decay length of the gradient, $\\lambda$, is defined as the distance over which the concentration falls to $1/e$ of its value. From the form of the solution, we identify $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$. The concentration profile is thus:\n$$c(x) = c_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nwhere $c_0 = c(0)$ is the concentration at the source boundary.\n\nThe mean mRNA count per cell, $m(x)$, is given as a linear function of the local Shh concentration:\n$$m(x) = \\alpha\\,c(x) + b$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a proportionality constant and $b$ is the basal mRNA count in the absence of signaling. We can isolate the signal-dependent component of the mRNA count, which we denote $m'(x)$:\n$$m'(x) = m(x) - b = \\alpha\\,c(x) = \\alpha\\, c_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nLet $m'_0 = \\alpha c_0$. Then $m'(x) = m'_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$. The decay length $\\lambda$ of the Shh protein gradient is the same as the decay length of the signal-dependent mRNA response.\n\nWe are given measurements at two positions, $x_1$ and $x_2$. We can write:\n$$m'(x_1) = m'_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x_1}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\n$$m'(x_2) = m'_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x_2}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nTo find $\\lambda$, we take the ratio of these two equations to eliminate the unknown $m'_0$:\n$$\\frac{m'(x_2)}{m'(x_1)} = \\frac{m'_0 \\exp(-x_2/\\lambda)}{m'_0 \\exp(-x_1/\\lambda)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{x_1 - x_2}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{m'(x_2)}{m'(x_1)}\\right) = \\frac{x_1 - x_2}{\\lambda}$$\nSolving for $\\lambda$ yields the closed-form expression:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{x_1 - x_2}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{m'(x_2)}{m'(x_1)}\\right)} = \\frac{x_2 - x_1}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{m'(x_1)}{m'(x_2)}\\right)}$$\nThis is the expression for the decay length.\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values from the $Ptch1$ dataset.\nGiven: $x_1 = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $x_2 = 200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $m_{\\mathrm{Ptch1}}(x_1) = 100$, $m_{\\mathrm{Ptch1}}(x_2) = 50$, and $b_{\\mathrm{Ptch1}} = 20$.\nFirst, calculate the signal-dependent mRNA counts:\n$$m'_{\\mathrm{Ptch1}}(x_1) = m_{\\mathrm{Ptch1}}(x_1) - b_{\\mathrm{Ptch1}} = 100 - 20 = 80$$\n$$m'_{\\mathrm{Ptch1}}(x_2) = m_{\\mathrm{Ptch1}}(x_2) - b_{\\mathrm{Ptch1}} = 50 - 20 = 30$$\nNow, substitute these into the expression for $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{200 - 100}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{80}{30}\\right)} = \\frac{100}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{8}{3}\\right)}$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{100}{\\ln(2.666...)} \\approx \\frac{100}{0.980829} \\approx 101.9545\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $\\lambda = 102\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nAs a consistency check, we repeat the calculation using the $Hhip$ dataset.\nGiven: $m_{\\mathrm{Hhip}}(x_1) = 70$, $m_{\\mathrm{Hhip}}(x_2) = 32.5$, and $b_{\\mathrm{Hhip}} = 10$.\nThe signal-dependent counts are:\n$$m'_{\\mathrm{Hhip}}(x_1) = m_{\\mathrm{Hhip}}(x_1) - b_{\\mathrm{Hhip}} = 70 - 10 = 60$$\n$$m'_{\\mathrm{Hhip}}(x_2) = m_{\\mathrm{Hhip}}(x_2) - b_{\\mathrm{Hhip}} = 32.5 - 10 = 22.5$$\nThe ratio is $\\frac{m'_{\\mathrm{Hhip}}(x_2)}{m'_{\\mathrm{Hhip}}(x_1)} = \\frac{22.5}{60} = \\frac{45}{120} = \\frac{3}{8}$.\nThe decay length is:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{100 - 200}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{8}\\right)} = \\frac{-100}{-\\ln\\left(\\frac{8}{3}\\right)} = \\frac{100}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{8}{3}\\right)} \\approx 102\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nThe result is identical, which confirms that the provided data for both genes are consistent with the underlying model of a single Shh gradient with a characteristic decay length $\\lambda$.\nThe final computed value for the decay length is $102\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{102}$$", "id": "2673158"}]}
