Use the following well-established facts as the starting point for your reasoning. First, the dorsal ectoderm expresses Wnt family member 7A (Wnt7a), which signals to the dorsal mesenchyme to induce LIM homeobox transcription factor $1$ beta (Lmx1b), a transcription factor necessary and sufficient for dorsal mesenchymal identity. Second, the ventral ectoderm expresses Engrailed-$1$ (En1), a transcriptional repressor that prevents Wnt7a expression in the ventral ectoderm, thereby restricting dorsalizing signal to the dorsal side. Third, when Engrailed-$1$ function is lost, Wnt7a is derepressed in ventral ectoderm, producing ectopic dorsalizing signal and dorsalization of ventral mesenchyme. Fourth, when Wnt7a function is lost, dorsal fate is not induced in the mesenchyme, and dorsal structures fail to form.\n\nConsider a double mutant embryo that is null for both Engrailed-$1$ and Wnt7a. In this genetic context, Engrailed-$1$ loss would normally derepress Wnt7a ventrally, but Wnt7a is genetically absent. Based on the above principles—signal restriction by repression, requirement of a dorsalizing ligand for induction of a downstream transcription factor, and genetic epistasis in linear pathways—predict the most likely dorsal–ventral patterning outcome in the limb and interpret what this reveals about the necessity and epistasis relationship of Wnt7a in specifying dorsal fate.\n\nWhich option best matches the expected phenotype and the correct interpretation?\n\nA.

Dorsal ectoderm expresses Wnt family member 7A ($Wnt7a$).\n2.  $Wnt7a$ signals to dorsal mesenchyme to induce LIM homeobox transcription factor $1$ beta ($Lmx1b$).\n3.  $Lmx1b$ is a transcription factor necessary and sufficient for dorsal mesenchymal identity.\n4.  Ventral ectoderm expresses Engrailed-$1$ ($En1$).\n5.  $En1$ is a transcriptional repressor that prevents $Wnt7a$ expression in the ventral ectoderm.\n6.  Loss of $En1$ function leads to derepression of $Wnt7a$ in ventral ectoderm, causing ectopic dorsalization.\n7.  Loss of $Wnt7a$ function leads to failure of dorsal fate induction, and dorsal structures do not form.\n8.  The problem considers a double mutant embryo that is null for both $En1$ and $Wnt7a$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement describes a well-characterized genetic regulatory network in vertebrate limb development.\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The roles of $Wnt7a$, $En1$, and $Lmx1b$ in dorsal-ventral axis patterning of the limb are foundational concepts in developmental biology, supported by extensive experimental evidence. The described single-mutant phenotypes are factually correct. The problem is firmly based on established scientific principles.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem asks to predict the phenotype of a double mutant based on the logic of a given genetic pathway. This is a standard problem in genetics, specifically in epistasis analysis. A unique, logical solution can be derived from the premises.\n-   **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terms.\n-   **Self-Contained and Consistent:** The provided facts are sufficient to construct the genetic pathway and deduce the outcome. There are no internal contradictions. Fact $5$ establishes $En1$ as a repressor of $Wnt7a$. Fact $2$ establishes $Wnt7a$ as an inducer of $Lmx1b$. This forms a simple, linear regulatory cascade: $En1 \\dashv Wnt7a \\rightarrow Lmx1b$. The logic is sound.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard exercise in genetic logic and epistasis. The solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe problem describes a genetic pathway governing dorsal fate specification in the developing limb. This pathway can be represented as a linear sequence of events:\n1.  In the ventral ectoderm, the transcription factor $En1$ is normally expressed.\n2.  $En1$ functions to repress the expression of the $Wnt7a$ gene. This is denoted as $En1 \\dashv Wnt7a$.\n3.  In the dorsal ectoderm, $En1$ is absent, so $Wnt7a$ is expressed.\n4.  The secreted $Wnt7a$ protein acts as a signal (a ligand) that binds to receptors on the underlying dorsal mesenchyme.\n5.  This signaling event induces the expression of the transcription factor $Lmx1b$ in the dorsal mesenchyme.\n6.  $Lmx1b$ then directs the cells to adopt a dorsal fate.\nThe complete pathway for dorsal specification is thus: $En1 \\dashv Wnt7a \\rightarrow Lmx1b \\rightarrow \\text{Dorsal Fate}$.\n\nWe are asked to predict the phenotype of a double mutant, where both $En1$ and $Wnt7a$ are non-functional (null mutants). Let us analyze this situation using the principles of epistasis. Epistasis refers to a phenomenon where the phenotypic effect of one gene's mutation is masked by the mutation of another gene. In a linear pathway, a mutation in a downstream gene is typically epistatic to a mutation in an upstream gene.\n\nLet's consider the state of the pathway in the double mutant:\n-   **Effect of $En1$ loss:** The gene for $En1$ is non-functional. Therefore, the repressor $En1$ is not produced. In a normal context, this would lead to the derepression of the $Wnt7a$ gene in the ventral ectoderm. The genetic \"stop\" signal is removed.\n-   **Effect of $Wnt7a$ loss:** The gene for $Wnt7a$ is also non-functional. This means that even if the repressor ($En1$) is absent and the $Wnt7a$ gene is \"turned on\" transcriptionally, no functional $Wnt7a$ protein can be produced.\n-   **Combined effect:** The absence of the $En1$ repressor is rendered irrelevant by the absence of a functional $Wnt7a$ gene to be expressed. There will be no $Wnt7a$ protein secreted from either the dorsal or the ventral ectoderm.\n-   **Downstream consequence:** Since $Wnt7a$ is the required signaling ligand to induce $Lmx1b$ (as stated in given fact $7$), and no $Wnt7a$ is present, $Lmx1b$ will not be induced in the mesenchyme.\n-   **Final phenotype:** Without $Lmx1b$ expression, dorsal fate cannot be specified. The entire limb mesenchyme, both dorsal and ventral, will fail to acquire dorsal identity. This results in a limb that is \"ventralized,\" meaning it has ventral characteristics on all sides. This phenotype is identical to that of the $Wnt7a$ single mutant, as described in given fact $4$.\n\n**Epistasis analysis:** Since the phenotype of the double mutant ($En1$-null; $Wnt7a$-null) is identical to the phenotype of the $Wnt7a$-null single mutant, we conclude that the $Wnt7a$ gene is epistatic to the $En1$ gene. This is expected, as $Wnt7a$ acts downstream of $En1$ in the control of dorsal fate. The necessity of $Wnt7a$ is demonstrated by the fact that in its absence, the state of its upstream regulator ($En1$) does not matter; dorsal fate is not specified regardless.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Circumferential dorsalization of the limb ectoderm and mesenchyme (“double dorsal”), with dorsal structures surrounding the limb, indicating that Engrailed-$1$ is necessary and epistatic to Wnt7a for dorsal fate.**\nThe predicted phenotype, \"double dorsal,\" is the phenotype of an $En1$ single mutant, not the double mutant. The reasoning fails to account for the absence of $Wnt7a$. The interpretation of epistasis is incorrect; $Wnt7a$ is epistatic to $En1$, not the other way around.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Loss of dorsal fate with ventral structures encircling the limb (“ventralized” limb resembling a Wnt7a single mutant), indicating that Wnt7a is necessary and epistatic to Engrailed-$1$ for dorsal fate.**\nThe predicted phenotype, a \"ventralized\" limb, matches our derivation. This phenotype is indeed that of a $Wnt7a$ single mutant. The interpretation that $Wnt7a$ is necessary for dorsal fate and epistatic to $En1$ is correct, as the loss of the downstream component ($Wnt7a$) determines the final outcome, masking the effect of the loss of the upstream regulator ($En1$).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Near-normal dorsal–ventral patterning due to compensation by Wnt family member $7$B (Wnt7b) and autoactivation of LIM homeobox transcription factor $1$ beta (Lmx1b), indicating that Wnt7a is sufficient but not necessary for dorsal fate.**\nThis option introduces mechanisms ($Wnt7b$ compensation, $Lmx1b$ autoactivation) that are not included in the problem statement's given facts. Reasoning must be confined to the provided information. Furthermore, the conclusion that $Wnt7a$ is not necessary directly contradicts given fact $7$, which states that its loss prevents the formation of dorsal structures.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. A mixed pattern with dorsal identity restricted to the anterior side and ventral identity to the posterior side due to crosstalk with Sonic hedgehog (Shh), indicating that neither gene is epistatic and that dorsal–ventral patterning is primarily determined by anterior–posterior cues.**\nThis option incorrectly mixes the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis with the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis. It introduces the A-P signaling molecule $Shh$, which is outside the scope of the problem as defined. The conclusion that neither gene is epistatic is a direct contradiction of the result from a standard epistasis test on this linear pathway.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$"}, {"introduction": "Genetic pathways are often more complex than simple linear chains, with signaling molecules exhibiting pleiotropy by acting in multiple distinct processes.

In addition to its role in dorso-ventral patterning, Wnt7a contributes to proper anteroposterior patterning by supporting Sonic hedgehog (Shh) in the posterior mesenchyme (the Zone of Polarizing Activity, ZPA), a function not thought to be mediated by Lmx1b.

The question asks for a logical deduction of the resulting phenotype based on the provided set of rules (gene interactions). The problem is self-contained and has a unique, deducible solution.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal and uses standard scientific nomenclature. It is free from ambiguity and subjectivity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formulated question in developmental genetics that is scientifically sound and logically consistent. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe problem asks to determine the phenotype of a $Wnt7a$ null limb where $Lmx1b$ is forcibly expressed in the mesenchyme. We will analyze the consequences for the dorso-ventral ($D-V$) and anteroposterior ($A-P$) axes separately, based on the provided genetic pathway.\n\nThe standard pathway for $D-V$ patterning is as follows:\n$Wnt7a$ (dorsal ectoderm) $\\rightarrow$ $Lmx1b$ (dorsal mesenchyme) $\\rightarrow$ Dorsal Mesenchymal Identity $\\rightarrow$ Inductive Signal to Ectoderm $\\rightarrow$ Dorsal Ectodermal Identity.\n\nThe pathway for $A-P$ patterning involving $Wnt7a$ is:\n$Wnt7a$ (dorsal ectoderm) $\\rightarrow$ Maintenance of $Shh$ (posterior mesenchyme).\n\nCritically, the problem states that the $Wnt7a \\rightarrow Shh$ pathway is independent of $Lmx1b$.\n\nLet us analyze the experimental conditions:\n- **Background:** $Wnt7a$ is null. In the absence of the experimental intervention, this would lead to a loss of $Lmx1b$ expression, a failure to specify dorsal mesenchyme (resulting in a ventralized mesenchymal phenotype), a subsequent failure of the mesenchyme to induce dorsal ectodermal structures like nails, and reduced $Shh$ expression leading to loss of posterior digits. The limb would be double-ventral and have $A-P$ defects.\n- **Intervention:** $Lmx1b$ is expressed throughout the limb mesenchyme, driven by a $Prx1$ enhancer.\n\nWe now apply the principles of genetic epistasis. The experiment places $Lmx1b$ expression downstream of the point of failure (the absence of its inducer, $Wnt7a$).\n\n1.  **Dorsal Mesenchymal Fate:** According to the given pathway, $Lmx1b$ induction is the step immediately following $Wnt7a$ signaling required for dorsal mesenchymal identity. By artificially providing $Lmx1b$, we bypass the requirement for $Wnt7a$ for this specific process. Therefore, the limb mesenchyme that expresses $Lmx1b$ will acquire a dorsal identity. This means dorsal mesenchymal structures, such as dorsal dermis and extensor tendons, should be specified correctly. This portion of the phenotype is rescued.\n\n2.  **Dorsal Ectodermal Fate:** The problem states that dorsal mesenchyme instructs the overlying ectoderm to form dorsal structures (e.g., nail organ). Since the mesenchymal identity has been rescued and dorsalized by the forced expression of $Lmx1b$, this newly dorsalized mesenchyme is now competent to send the required inductive signals to the overlying ectoderm. Therefore, the ectoderm, despite being $Wnt7a$-deficient itself, will be induced to form dorsal structures. The nail organ should be restored. This is a classic example of reciprocal induction, where rescue in one tissue (mesenchyme) leads to rescue in an interacting tissue (ectoderm).\n\n3.  **Anteroposterior Patterning:** The problem explicitly states that the role of $Wnt7a$ in supporting $Shh$ expression is not mediated by $Lmx1b$. The animal is $Wnt7a$ null, so the $Wnt7a$ signal is absent. Since providing $Lmx1b$ does not substitute for $Wnt7a$ in this separate pathway, the maintenance of $Shh$ in the $ZPA$ will remain defective. Consequently, the defects in anteroposterior patterning, such as the loss of posterior digits, will persist. This part of the phenotype is not rescued.\n\n4.  **Ventral Ectoderm and $En1$ Expression:** The problem states that $En1$ regulation is normal. There is no information to suggest that dorsalization of the underlying mesenchyme would feed back to repress $En1$ in the ventral ectoderm. The cues that establish the ventral ectoderm and its expression of $En1$ are presumed to be upstream or independent of this specific rescue experiment. Thus, $En1$ expression in the ventral ectoderm should remain unchanged.\n\n**Conclusion of Analysis:**\nThe experiment is predicted to result in:\n- Rescue of dorsal mesenchymal identity.\n- Rescue of dorsal ectodermal identity (via induction from the rescued mesenchyme).\n- Persistent defects in anteroposterior patterning (loss of posterior digits) due to failed $Shh$ support.\n- Unchanged $En1$ expression in the ventral ectoderm.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Dorsal mesenchymal identities (for example, dorsal dermis characteristics, extensor tendons and muscle patterning) and the nail organ are restored via mesenchyme-to-ectoderm induction; posterior digit loss persists due to failure to sustain Sonic hedgehog in the Zone of Polarizing Activity; ventral ectodermal Engrailed-1 remains unchanged.**\nThis option perfectly matches all four points of our derived conclusion. It correctly identifies the rescue of both mesenchymal and, consequently, ectodermal dorsal fates. It correctly identifies the persistence of the $A-P$ defect based on the stated $Lmx1b$-independence of the $Wnt7a \\rightarrow Shh$ pathway. It also correctly states that $En1$ expression is unaffected.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Only dorsal ectodermal traits such as the nail organ are restored, whereas dorsal mesenchymal features remain ventralized; posterior digit patterning is rescued because forced Lmx1b compensates for loss of Wnt7a in maintaining Sonic hedgehog.**\nThis option contains multiple errors. Mesenchymal features would not remain ventralized, as $Lmx1b$ is the dorsalizing factor. Ectodermal traits cannot be restored if the underlying mesenchyme is not dorsalized first. Posterior digit patterning is not rescued, as this pathway is $Lmx1b$-independent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. No rescue occurs: dorsal traits in both mesenchyme and ectoderm remain absent because Wnt7a is required cell-autonomously in ectoderm and cannot be bypassed by mesenchymal Lmx1b; posterior digit pattern remains unaltered.**\nThis option incorrectly claims no rescue occurs, which contradicts the principle of genetic epistasis where a downstream gene can rescue an upstream mutation. While $Wnt7a$ is produced in the ectoderm, its effect on mesenchymal dorsalization is non-autonomous (acting on a different cell type), and this is precisely what is being bypassed. The claim of no rescue is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Complete rescue to near wild type: dorsal mesenchymal and ectodermal traits are restored, posterior digits are normalized, and dorsal ectoderm re-expresses Wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 7A with concomitant dorsal repression of Engrailed-1.**\nThis option incorrectly claims complete rescue. Posterior digits would not be normalized because the $Shh$ pathway is not rescued. Furthermore, there is no basis to suggest that a null $Wnt7a$ gene would be re-expressed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Posterior digit pattern is rescued by forced Lmx1b restoring Sonic hedgehog, but dorsal ectodermal and mesenchymal traits remain ventralized because Wnt7a is absent from ectoderm.**\nThis option is incorrect on both counts. The posterior digit pattern is not rescued, and the dorsal traits in the mesenchyme (and subsequently ectoderm) are, in fact, rescued by the forced expression of the downstream effector $Lmx1b$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$"}, {"introduction": "To fully understand pattern formation, we can translate qualitative genetic diagrams into quantitative, predictive models.

A diffusion term, $D \\cdot \\partial_{xx} C$, which is derived from Fick's laws and describes the spatial spreading of molecules from regions of high concentration to low concentration.\n$2$. A production term, which includes a spatially-dependent basal production rate ($\\rho_W(x)$ or $\\rho_E(x)$) that is repressed by the other species. The repression is modeled by a Hill function, a standard sigmoidal form for describing cooperative biochemical inhibition. The mutual repression between $W$ and $E$ establishes a bistable \"toggle switch\" system, where locally, either high $W$/low $E$ or low $W$/high $E$ states are stable.\n$3$. A linear degradation term, $-\\mu C$, representing the removal or decay of the molecules at a constant rate.\n\nThe spatial pre-pattern is introduced via the production rate functions:\n$$\n\\rho_W(x)=\\rho_{W0}\\,\\big(1-\\alpha_W s(x)\\big), \\qquad \\rho_E(x)=\\rho_{E0}\\,\\big(1+\\alpha_E s(x)\\big)\n$$\nwhere $s(x)=\\tanh((x-x_0)/\\lambda)$ provides a smooth transition from $s(x) \\approx -1$ in the dorsal region ($x < x_0$) to $s(x) \\approx +1$ in the ventral region ($x > x_0$). This pre-pattern biases the system, favoring $W$ production dorsally and $E$ production ventrally. The parameters $\\alpha_W$ and $\\alpha_E$ control the strength of this bias. A balanced bias ($\\alpha_W \\approx \\alpha_E$) is expected to pin the boundary between the two domains, while an imbalanced bias will cause the boundary to drift, creating a traveling front.\n\nTo solve this system computationally, we employ the method of lines, which involves discretizing the spatial domain first.\n\n**Spatial Discretization:**\nThe domain $x \\in [0, L]$ is discretized into $N_x$ equidistant points $x_i = i \\cdot \\Delta x$ for $i=0, 1, \\dots, N_x-1$, where the grid spacing is $\\Delta x = L / (N_x-1)$. The second spatial derivative (the Laplacian) is approximated using a second-order central difference formula:\n$$\n\\partial_{xx} C(x_i) \\approx \\frac{C(x_{i+1}) - 2C(x_i) + C(x_{i-1})}{(\\Delta x)^2} = \\frac{C_{i+1} - 2C_i + C_{i-1}}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\nThe no-flux boundary conditions, $\\partial_x C = 0$ at $x=0$ and $x=L$, are enforced by introducing \"ghost points\" such that $C_{-1} = C_1$ and $C_{N_x} = C_{N_x-2}$. This leads to modified formulas for the Laplacian at the boundaries:\n$$\n\\text{at } i=0: \\quad \\partial_{xx} C_0 \\approx \\frac{2(C_1 - C_0)}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{at } i=N_x-1: \\quad \\partial_{xx} C_{N_x-1} \\approx \\frac{2(C_{N_x-2} - C_{N_x-1})}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\n\n**Temporal Discretization:**\nWith space discretized, the system of PDEs is converted into a large system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), one for each species at each grid point. We integrate this system in time using an explicit Forward-Time Central-Space (FTCS) method. For a generic concentration $C_i$ at time $t$, its value at the next time step $t+\\Delta t$ is given by:\n$$\nC_i(t+\\Delta t) = C_i(t) + \\Delta t \\left( D \\cdot (\\text{Laplacian}_i) + \\text{Reaction}_i \\right)\n$$\nThe explicit nature of this method imposes a stability constraint on the time step $\\Delta t$, known as the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition. For the diffusion part, this condition is $\\Delta t \\le \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2D}$. To ensure stability for the entire system, we choose a time step based on the largest diffusion coefficient, $D_{\\text{max}} = \\max(D_W, D_E)$, with a safety factor:\n$$\n\\Delta t = 0.45 \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{D_{\\text{max}}}\n$$\nThis ensures the numerical scheme remains stable throughout the simulation. For the case where the maximum diffusion coefficient is zero, a small, fixed time step is chosen that is known to be stable for the reaction kinetics alone.\n\n**Interface Position and Classification:**\nThe interface between the dorsal ($W$-dominant) and ventral ($E$-dominant) domains is defined as the unique spatial location $x_{\\text{if}}$ where the concentrations are equal, i.e., $W(x_{\\text{if}}, t) = E(x_{\\text{if}}, t)$, or equivalently, where the difference $f(x,t) = W(x,t) - E(x,t)$ crosses zero. On our discrete grid, we locate the index $i$ where the sign of $f_i$ changes (i.e., $f_i \\cdot f_{i+1} < 0$). We then use linear interpolation between points $(x_i, f_i)$ and $(x_{i+1}, f_{i+1})$ to find a more precise, sub-grid estimate of the zero-crossing. If no such sign change exists, the interface has been lost, typically because one species has outcompeted the other across the entire domain.\n\nTo classify the boundary's stability, we measure its velocity at late times. We calculate the interface position at $t_1 = 0.9T$ and at the final time $t_2=T$. The average speed over this interval is $v = (x_{\\text{if}}(t_2) - x_{\\text{if}}(t_1))/(t_2 - t_1)$.\n- If the interface is found at both times and its speed magnitude $|v|$ is less than a tolerance $\\varepsilon_x$, the boundary is classified as \"stable boundary\" (True).\n- If $|v| \\ge \\varepsilon_x$ or if the interface is lost at either $t_1$ or $t_2$, it is classified as a \"traveling front\" (False).\n\nThe provided test cases explore the effect of production biases and diffusion.\n- **Case A** $(\\alpha_W=0.8, \\alpha_E=0.8, D_E=10^{-5})$: Symmetrical biases should pin the front, leading to a stable boundary.\n- **Case B** $(\\alpha_W=0.9, \\alpha_E=0.7, D_E=10^{-5})$: A stronger bias for $W$ should cause the front to travel towards the ventral side ($x > 0.5$).\n- **Case C** $(\\alpha_W=0.6, \\alpha_E=0.9, D_E=10^{-5})$: A stronger bias for $E$ should cause the front to travel towards the dorsal side ($x < 0.5$).\n- **Case D** $(\\alpha_W=0.8, \\alpha_E=0.8, D_E=0)$: Symmetrical biases but with an immobile repressor $E$. The lack of diffusion for $E$ will sharpen its profile, but the balanced production bias is expected to maintain a stable boundary.\nThe program will implement this full numerical procedure for each test case and report the classification.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the reaction-diffusion system for dorso-ventral limb patterning\n    and classifies boundary stability for several parameter sets.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Fixed Parameters ---\n    L = 1.0          # Domain length\n    x0 = 0.5         # Center of pre-pattern\n    lam = 0.02       # Width of pre-pattern transition\n    Nx = 256         # Number of spatial grid points\n    DW = 1e-3        # Diffusion coefficient for Wnt7a\n    n = 2.0          # Hill exponent for E repression\n    m = 2.0          # Hill exponent for W repression\n    KE = 0.5         # Half-repression threshold for E\n    KW = 0.5         # Half-repression threshold for W\n    muW = 1.0        # Degradation rate for W\n    muE = 1.0        # Degradation rate for E\n    rhoW0 = 2.0      # Basal production amplitude for W\n    rhoE0 = 2.0      # Basal production amplitude for E\n    Whi = 1.8        # Initial high concentration for W\n    Wlo = 0.1        # Initial low concentration for W\n    Ehi = 1.8        # Initial high concentration for E\n    Elo = 0.1        # Initial low concentration for E\n    T = 10.0         # Total simulation time\n    epsilon_x = 0.002 # Speed tolerance for stability classification\n\n    # --- Spatial Discretization ---\n    x = np.linspace(0, L, Nx)\n    dx = L / (Nx -
