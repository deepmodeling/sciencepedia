It presents a simplified but standard quantitative model of a biological signaling pathway. All necessary components for a solution are provided, and there are no internal contradictions. Therefore, we may proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem provides two fundamental relationships. First, the fractional occupancy of the BMP receptor, $R$, as a function of the BMP ligand concentration, $B$:\n$$R(B) = \\frac{B}{K_d + B}$$\nHere, $K_d$ is the dissociation constant. This expression is a direct consequence of the law of mass action for a single-site reversible binding process at quasi-equilibrium.\n\nSecond, the probability of apoptosis, $P$, as a function of the receptor occupancy, $R$:\n$$P(R) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-(aR - b))}$$\nThis is a logistic function, a standard model for a probabilistic switch-like response. The parameters $a > 0$ and $b$ govern the sensitivity and threshold concentration of the response, respectively.\n\nThe first task is to derive a closed-form expression for the probability of apoptosis as a direct function of the BMP concentration, $P(B)$. This is achieved by algebraic substitution. We eliminate the intermediate variable $R$ by substituting the first equation into the second:\n$$P(B) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\left(a\\left(\\frac{B}{K_d + B}\\right) - b\\right)\\right)}$$\nThis can be rewritten by distributing the negative sign in the exponent for slightly improved clarity:\n$$P(B) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(b - \\frac{aB}{K_d + B}\\right)}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for $P(B)$. It describes the entire input-output relationship from the extracellular signal, $B$, to the cellular fate decision, $P$.\n\nThe second task is to find the specific concentration of BMP, which we will denote $B_{1/2}$, at which the probability of apoptosis is exactly one-half, i.e., $P(B_{1/2}) = 0.5$. We begin by setting the general expression for $P$ to this value:\n$$0.5 = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-(aR - b))}$$\nSolving for the exponential term:\n$$1 + \\exp(-(aR - b)) = \\frac{1}{0.5} = 2$$\n$$\\exp(-(aR - b)) = 1$$\nThe only real value whose exponential is $1$ is $0$. Therefore, the argument of the exponential function must be zero:\n$$-(aR - b) = 0$$\n$$aR - b = 0$$\nThis gives the critical receptor occupancy, $R_{1/2}$, that corresponds to a $50\\%$ chance of apoptosis:\n$$R_{1/2} = \\frac{b}{a}$$\nNow, we must find the BMP concentration $B_{1/2}$ that yields this specific level of receptor occupancy. We use the receptor occupancy equation:\n$$R(B_{1/2}) = \\frac{B_{1/2}}{K_d + B_{1/2}}$$\nSetting $R(B_{1/2}) = R_{1/2}$:\n$$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{B_{1/2}}{K_d + B_{1/2}}$$\nWe now solve for $B_{1/2}$. Cross-multiplication gives:\n$$b(K_d + B_{1/2}) = a B_{1/2}$$\n$$bK_d + bB_{1/2} = aB_{1/2}$$\n$$bK_d = aB_{1/2} - bB_{1/2}$$\n$$bK_d = (a - b)B_{1/2}$$\nIsolating $B_{1/2}$, we find the final expression:\n$$B_{1/2} = \\frac{bK_d}{a - b}$$\nFor this result to be biologically feasible, several conditions must hold. First, concentration $B$ must be non-negative. As $K_d$ (a dissociation constant) is strictly positive, this requires that $\\frac{b}{a-b} \\ge 0$. Second, the receptor occupancy $R = b/a$ must be physically possible. Since $R(B)$ is defined as $\\frac{B}{K_d+B}$, its value is bounded in the interval $[0, 1)$. Thus, we must have $0 \\le R_{1/2} < 1$, which translates to $0 \\le \\frac{b}{a} < 1$. Given that $a > 0$, this requires $0 \\le b < a$. If this condition holds, then $b \\ge 0$ and $a - b > 0$, which ensures that our expression for $B_{1/2}$ is non-negative, consistent with physical reality. If $b=a$, $B_{1/2}$ is undefined, corresponding to the unphysical requirement that $R=1$, which is only achieved at an infinite ligand concentration. If $b>a$ or $b<0$, the required occupancy is outside the possible range, so no finite, non-negative concentration $B$ can produce $P=0.5$.
