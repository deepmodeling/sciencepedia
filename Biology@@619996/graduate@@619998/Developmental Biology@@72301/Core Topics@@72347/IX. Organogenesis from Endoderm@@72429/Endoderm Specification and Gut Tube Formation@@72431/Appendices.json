Cells adopt an endoderm fate when the transcription factor SRY-Box Transcription Factor 17 (*Sox17*) is induced. Empirically, Sox17 induction is ultrasensitive and can be approximated by a sharp threshold at a Nodal concentration $T$ due to high-cooperativity Smad2/3-mediated transcription. Let the tissue occupy the half-line $x \\geq 0$ with the organizer at $x=0$, and suppose the steady-state Nodal gradient is given by the well-tested exponential form $C(x)=C_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, where $C_0>0$ is the concentration at the source and $\\lambda>0$ is the decay length set by diffusion and clearance.\n\nUsing the threshold model of morphogen interpretation, the endoderm–mesoderm fate boundary $x^{\\ast}$ is defined implicitly by $C(x^{\\ast})=T$, with $C_0>T>0$ to ensure that some region attains the threshold. Starting from the core definitions of a threshold-based fate decision and the provided steady-state gradient, derive a closed-form analytic expression for $x^{\\ast}$ in terms of $C_0$, $T$, and $\\lambda$. Then, analyze how changing $\\lambda$ shifts $x^{\\ast}$ by computing the sign of the sensitivity $\\mathrm{d}x^{\\ast}/\\mathrm{d}\\lambda$ and interpreting it in words. No numerical evaluation is required and no rounding is needed. Your final reported answer should be only the explicit expression for $x^{\\ast}$.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically sound and mathematically well-posed. It presents a standard, simplified model of morphogen gradient interpretation, which is a fundamental concept in developmental biology. All necessary parameters and definitions are provided, and the constraints are consistent. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem defines the steady-state concentration profile of the morphogen Nodal as a function of position $x$ along a one-dimensional tissue:\n$$C(x) = C_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nHere, $C_0$ is the concentration at the source position $x=0$, and $\\lambda$ is the characteristic decay length of the gradient.\n\nThe model for cell fate determination is based on a sharp threshold. Cells are specified as endoderm if the local Nodal concentration $C(x)$ exceeds a critical threshold value $T$. The boundary between the endoderm and mesoderm domains, which we denote as $x^{\\ast}$, is therefore the precise location where the concentration equals this threshold. This is expressed by the implicit definition:\n$$C(x^{\\ast}) = T$$\n\nTo derive the explicit, closed-form expression for $x^{\\ast}$, we substitute the functional form of $C(x)$ into this defining equation:\n$$C_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{\\lambda}\\right) = T$$\n\nThe problem provides the constraint $C_0 > T > 0$. This is a crucial condition. It ensures that a physically meaningful solution for $x^{\\ast} > 0$ exists, because the concentration at the source, $C(0) = C_0$, is greater than the threshold, while the concentration far from the source, $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} C(x) = 0$, is less than the threshold. By the intermediate value theorem for a continuous function, a point $x^{\\ast}$ must exist where $C(x^{\\ast}) = T$.\n\nWe now solve the equation for $x^{\\ast}$ through algebraic manipulation. First, we isolate the exponential term by dividing by $C_0$:\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{\\lambda}\\right) = \\frac{T}{C_0}$$\n\nNext, to solve for the argument of the exponential, we apply the natural logarithm, $\\ln$, to both sides of the equation:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{\\lambda}\\right)\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{T}{C_0}\\right)$$\nThe natural logarithm is the inverse function of the exponential, so the left side simplifies to:\n$$-\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{\\lambda} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{T}{C_0}\\right)$$\n\nTo simplify the expression further, we use the fundamental logarithmic identity $\\ln(a/b) = -\\ln(b/a)$. Applying this to the right-hand side, we obtain:\n$$-\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{\\lambda} = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{C_0}{T}\\right)$$\n\nFinally, we multiply both sides by $-\\lambda$ to isolate $x^{\\ast}$, yielding the final analytical expression for the position of the fate boundary:\n$$x^{\\ast} = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_0}{T}\\right)$$\n\nThis is the required closed-form expression for $x^{\\ast}$ in terms of the system parameters $C_0$, $T$, and $\\lambda$.\n\nThe second part of the analysis requires us to compute the sign of the sensitivity of $x^{\\ast}$ with respect to the decay length $\\lambda$, which is given by the derivative $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x^{\\ast}}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda}$. Treating $C_0$ and $T$ as constants, we differentiate the expression for $x^{\\ast}$:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x^{\\ast}}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda}\\left[ \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_0}{T}\\right) \\right]$$\nThe term $\\ln\\left(\\frac{C_0}{T}\\right)$ is a constant factor with respect to $\\lambda$. Thus, the derivative is:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x^{\\ast}}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_0}{T}\\right)$$\n\nTo determine the sign of this derivative, we revisit the given constraint $C_0 > T > 0$. This implies that the ratio $\\frac{C_0}{T} > 1$. The natural logarithm function, $\\ln(z)$, is strictly positive for any argument $z > 1$. Therefore, we can conclude that the derivative is positive:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x^{\\ast}}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda} > 0$$\n\nA positive sign for the sensitivity $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x^{\\ast}}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda}$ indicates that $x^{\\ast}$ is a monotonically increasing function of $\\lambda$. The clear interpretation in the context of the biological system is that an increase in the decay length $\\lambda$ causes the morphogen gradient to become shallower, meaning it extends further into the tissue before decaying. Consequently, the position $x^{\\ast}$ where the concentration drops to the threshold $T$ shifts further away from the source at $x=0$. In biological terms, increasing the range of the Nodal signal expands the size of the tissue domain that is specified as endoderm.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_0}{T}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2634309"}, {"introduction": "Beyond initial patterning, development involves complex morphogenetic events where cells and tissues physically shape organs.

In a conditional, endoderm-specific mutant, histology at the foregut level shows two apposed endodermal epithelia that fail to meet and there is a gap in luminal continuity consistent with foregut atresia. You cannot perform live imaging and must infer mechanism from fixed sections. You hypothesize that the primary defect is either (i) persistence of a basement membrane barrier between the apposing epithelia or (ii) a failure of epithelial migration and fusion at the portal front.\n\nUsing as fundamental base that germ layers are specified by signaling pathways and transcription factors (for example, Nodal signaling induces SRY-Box transcription factor 17 (*SOX17*) and Forkhead box A2 (*FOXA2*) in definitive endoderm), that epithelial sheets are separated from mesenchyme by a specialized extracellular matrix (ECM) called basement membrane composed of Laminins, Collagen type IV, Nidogens, and Perlecan, and that epithelial fusion requires local basement membrane removal and active cell migration mediated by integrins and focal adhesion signaling, select the single option that both (a) gives the most accurate mechanistic explanation for why failure of portal fusion leads to foregut atresia and (b) proposes a minimal, mechanistically informative immunostaining panel with clear predicted outcomes that would distinguish persistence of basement membrane from lack of epithelial migration in fixed sections.\n\nA. Failure of portal fusion leaves the foregut in two blind-ended epithelial sacs because the endodermal sheets must converge and fuse across the midline to establish luminal continuity; without fusion, the continuity is never formed and the lumen is interrupted. To discriminate mechanisms, co-immunostain for Laminin and Collagen IV (to detect basement membrane), E-cadherin (to mark epithelium) together with either FOXA2 or SOX17 (to confirm endoderm identity), and phospho–Focal Adhesion Kinase (phospho-FAK) at tyrosine 397 or Paxillin (to report leading-edge migration signaling). Predictions: If the basement membrane persists, there will be a continuous Laminin/Collagen IV layer between the two E-cadherin-positive, FOXA2/SOX17-positive epithelia, and leading edges may show focal phospho-FAK puncta abutting the intact matrix; if epithelial migration fails, the midline will lack Laminin/Collagen IV (matrix already cleared), but the E-cadherin-positive, FOXA2/SOX17-positive fronts will remain lateral and show reduced or unpolarized phospho-FAK/Paxillin at prospective leading edges.\n\nB.

Portal fusion failure reflects a failure of epithelial recanalization by apoptosis; therefore, immunostain for Cleaved Caspase-3 and Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) in endoderm, and Zonula Occludens-1 (ZO-1) to assess tight junction integrity.

Germ layer specification: *Nodal* signaling induces SRY-Box transcription factor 17 (*SOX17*) and Forkhead box A2 (*FOXA2*) in definitive endoderm.\n    2.  Basement Membrane (BM): Epithelial sheets are separated from mesenchyme by a specialized extracellular matrix (ECM) called basement membrane, composed of Laminins, Collagen type IV, Nidogens, and Perlecan.\n    3.  Epithelial Fusion: Requires local basement membrane removal and active cell migration mediated by integrins and focal adhesion signaling.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is scrutinized for validity.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is well-grounded in the principles of developmental biology. The description of gut tube morphogenesis through the fusion of endodermal sheets, the molecular composition of the basement membrane, the roles of key transcription factors like *SOX17* and *FOXA2*, and the general mechanism of epithelial fusion (requiring both matrix degradation and cell migration) are all established facts.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It presents a specific biological observation (foregut atresia) and two distinct, plausible, and mutually exclusive mechanistic hypotheses. The task is to devise an experiment using a standard technique (immunostaining) to distinguish between these hypotheses, which has a clear and logical path to a solution.\n- **Objective**: The language is technical and precise. The hypotheses are stated as falsifiable scientific propositions. The evaluation criteria for the options are objective: mechanistic accuracy and the informative power of a proposed experiment.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to formulate a logical solution. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. Proceeding to solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe task is to select an option that correctly explains the phenotype and proposes an experiment to distinguish between two hypotheses for its cause: *Hypothesis (i)*, persistent basement membrane (BM), and *Hypothesis (ii)*, failed epithelial migration.\n\n#### Part (a): Mechanistic Explanation of Atresia\nThe formation of the gut tube is a morphogenetic process involving the transformation of 2D epithelial sheets into a 3D tube. The problem states that this occurs via convergence and fusion of bilateral endodermal sheets. Luminal continuity is a direct consequence of the successful fusion of these sheets along the dorsal and ventral midline. If this fusion event fails at the foregut portal, the two sheets remain separate. This results in two blind-ended tubes that do not connect, creating a physical gap in the presumptive digestive tract. This condition is, by definition, an atresia (the absence of a normal opening). Any correct explanation must articulate this fundamental consequence of failed epithelial fusion.\n\n#### Part (b): Minimal, Mechanistically Informative Immunostaining Panel\nTo distinguish between *Hypothesis (i)* and *Hypothesis (ii)* using fixed sections, we must visualize the key molecular players of each proposed mechanism.\n\n1.  **Tissue Identification**: It is imperative to first identify the tissues of interest.\n    *   **Endoderm**: The problem states *SOX17* and *FOXA2* are markers for definitive endoderm.\n    *   **Epithelium**: A general epithelial marker, such as E-cadherin (a cell-cell adhesion molecule crucial for epithelial integrity), is necessary to outline the cells and confirm their epithelial nature.\n\n2.  **Distinguishing the Hypotheses**:\n    *   To test *Hypothesis (i)* (persistent BM), one must directly visualize the BM. The problem states the BM is composed of Laminins and Collagen type IV. Immunostaining for these proteins will reveal the location and continuity of the BM.\n        *   **Prediction if (i) is true**: A continuous, uninterrupted line of staining for Laminin and/or Collagen type IV will be present in the space between the two apposed, but unfused, endodermal epithelia.\n    *   To test *Hypothesis (ii)* (failed migration), one must assess the migratory activity of the cells at the leading edge (the portal front). Active cell migration is driven by the cytoskeleton and mediated by signaling at focal adhesions, where cells connect to the ECM.\n        *   **Key Markers**: A common and reliable indicator of active focal adhesion signaling is the phosphorylation of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) at specific sites like tyrosine 397 ($pFAK^{Y397}$). Another key focal adhesion protein is Paxillin. Staining for phospho-FAK or Paxillin reveals sites of active cell-matrix interaction and migration signaling.\n        *   **Prediction if (ii) is true**: In this scenario, the BM at the midline would be expected to have been cleared correctly, so there should be a *gap* in Laminin/Collagen IV staining. However, the endodermal cells themselves would fail to migrate into this cleared space. This would be reflected as a weak, absent, or non-polarized signal for phospho-FAK or Paxillin at the leading edges of the epithelia. The cells are not \"trying\" to move.\n    *   **Contrasting Prediction for (i)**: If hypothesis (i) (persistent BM) is true, the cells might still be attempting to migrate but are physically blocked. In this case, one might observe polarized phospho-FAK/Paxillin puncta concentrated at the basal surface of the leading-edge cells, directly abutting the persistent BM.\n\nTherefore, a minimal and complete experimental panel must include markers for: endoderm identity (*FOXA2*/*SOX17*), epithelial structure (E-cadherin), the BM (Laminin/Collagen IV), and migratory signaling (phospho-FAK/Paxillin). The predicted outcomes for these markers under each hypothesis are distinct and allow for unambiguous discrimination.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Failure of portal fusion leaves the foregut in two blind-ended epithelial sacs because the endodermal sheets must converge and fuse across the midline to establish luminal continuity; without fusion, the continuity is never formed and the lumen is interrupted. To discriminate mechanisms, co-immunostain for Laminin and Collagen IV (to detect basement membrane), E-cadherin (to mark epithelium) together with either FOXA2 or SOX17 (to confirm endoderm identity), and phospho–Focal Adhesion Kinase (phospho-FAK) at tyrosine 397 or Paxillin (to report leading-edge migration signaling). Predictions: If the basement membrane persists, there will be a continuous Laminin/Collagen IV layer between the two E-cadherin-positive, FOXA2/SOX17-positive epithelia, and leading edges may show focal phospho-FAK puncta abutting the intact matrix; if epithelial migration fails, the midline will lack Laminin/Collagen IV (matrix already cleared), but the E-cadherin-positive, FOXA2/SOX17-positive fronts will remain lateral and show reduced or unpolarized phospho-FAK/Paxillin at prospective leading edges.**\n\n*   **Mechanistic Explanation**: This explanation is accurate and directly addresses the morphogenetic basis of the atresia, consistent with the fundamental principles.\n*   **Immunostaining Panel**: The proposed panel (Laminin, Collagen IV, E-cadherin, *FOXA2*/*SOX17*, phospho-FAK/Paxillin) is exactly the set of markers derived above as necessary and sufficient to distinguish the hypotheses. It targets tissue identity, the potential barrier (BM), and the migratory machinery.\n*   **Predictions**: The predicted outcomes for each hypothesis are logical, precise, and directly testable. They correctly contrast the state of the BM and the state of migration signaling in each scenario.\n*   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Failure of portal fusion causes atresia because mesenchymal condensation mechanically pinches off the foregut; therefore, immunostain for Vimentin and Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor alpha (PDGFRα) in mesenchyme, and for Fibronectin and Collagen I to assess matrix density at the interface. Predictions: Increased Vimentin/PDGFRα and Fibronectin/Collagen I at the midline indicates a mesenchymal pinch mechanism, whereas their absence indicates an epithelial migration defect.**\n\n*   **Mechanistic Explanation**: This introduces a novel hypothesis (\"mesenchymal condensation\") that is not one of the two options to be tested. The problem is explicitly about a defect in *endodermal epithelia*.\n*   **Immunostaining Panel**: The markers (Vimentin, $PDGFR\\alpha$, Fibronectin, Collagen I) are for mesenchyme and interstitial ECM, not the epithelial basement membrane or epithelial migration signaling. This panel is irrelevant to distinguishing between *Hypothesis (i)* and *Hypothesis (ii)*.\n*   **Predictions**: The predictions aim to test the \"mesenchymal pinch\" idea, not the two possibilities given in the problem statement.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Portal fusion failure reflects a failure of epithelial recanalization by apoptosis; therefore, immunostain for Cleaved Caspase-3 and Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) in endoderm, and Zonula Occludens-1 (ZO-1) to assess tight junction integrity. Predictions: High Cleaved Caspase-3/TUNEL signal and fragmented ZO-1 at the midline indicates apoptotic recanalization failure, whereas low apoptosis indicates persistent basement membrane.**\n\n*   **Mechanistic Explanation**: This invokes \"recanalization by apoptosis\", which is a fundamentally different process from the fusion of epithelial sheets described in the problem. Gut tube formation from folding sheets does not typically involve the creation of a solid cord followed by apoptosis to form a lumen.\n*   **Immunostaining Panel**: The panel (Cleaved Caspase-3, TUNEL, ZO-1) is designed to measure apoptosis and tight junction integrity. It provides no information about the state of the basement membrane (*Hypothesis (i)*) or migratory signaling (*Hypothesis (ii)*).\n*   **Predictions**: The prediction that low apoptosis implies a persistent BM is a *non sequitur*. There is no logical connection.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Failure of portal fusion reflects a dorsal-ventral patterning error in the foregut; therefore, immunostain for Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) and Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP4) gradients in endoderm, SRY-Box transcription factor 2 (SOX2) for foregut identity, and Brachyury (T) for mesoderm. Predictions: Altered SHH/BMP4 gradients with normal SOX2 and Brachyury indicate patterning failure rather than mechanical fusion defects; normal gradients implicate basement membrane persistence.**\n\n*   **Mechanistic Explanation**: This shifts the focus to an upstream cause (patterning) rather than the proximate mechanical failures (fusion). While a patterning defect could be the ultimate cause, the task is to distinguish between the two given *downstream* mechanisms of fusion failure.\n*   **Immunostaining Panel**: The panel (*SHH*, BMP4, *SOX2*, *Brachyury*) assesses tissue patterning and identity. It does not contain markers for the BM or for migratory machinery.\n*   **Predictions**: The prediction that normal patterning gradients \"implicate basement membrane persistence\" is a logical fallacy. Normal patterning does not rule out a failure in migration signaling, nor does it prove a defect in BM degradation machinery. This experiment cannot distinguish between *Hypothesis (i)* and *Hypothesis (ii)*.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2634247"}, {"introduction": "Modern developmental biology increasingly relies on high-throughput data to characterize cellular processes with unprecedented detail.

Consider three genes measured per cell: *Sox17* (*Sry-box 17*), *FoxA2* (*Forkhead box A2*), and *Nanog* (*Nanog Homeobox*). At a mechanistic level, endodermal transcription factors *Sox17* and *FoxA2* cooperatively activate an endodermal gene program, whereas *Nanog* is a core component of the pluripotency network that antagonizes differentiation. From the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and standard gene regulatory logic, a stable endoderm state corresponds to a fixed point where endodermal drivers are high and pluripotency drivers are low, and, due to cooperative regulation, the endodermal drivers rise coherently.\n\nYour task is to formalize a quantitative, unitless classification criterion for endoderm commitment using only the per-cell expression vectors for *Sox17*, *FoxA2*, and *Nanog* at a given Activin dose (Activin dose is provided in nanograms per milliliter, ng/mL, but the classification itself is unitless and must not depend explicitly on units).

The log-ratio endoderm commitment index, $R_i$, which quantifies the balance between endodermal drivers ($S_i$, $F_i$) and the pluripotency factor ($N_i$):\n$$\nR_i = \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{S_i + F_i + \\kappa}{N_i + \\kappa}\\right)\n$$\n$2$. The marker-coherence score, $c_i$, which measures the cooperative expression of the two endodermal drivers:\n$$\nc_i = \\frac{|S_i - F_i|}{S_i + F_i + \\delta}\n$$\n\nA cell $i$ is classified as committed if and only if all four of the following criteria are met:\n$1$. $R_i \\ge \\tau$ (endoderm program is dominant)\n$2$. $S_i \\ge S_{\\min}$ (Sox17 is sufficiently expressed)\n$3$. $F_i \\ge F_{\\min}$ (FoxA2 is sufficiently expressed)\n$4$. $c_i \\le \\eta$ (Sox17 and FoxA2 are coherently expressed)\n\nThe fraction of committed cells, $\\phi$, for a given dataset is the number of cells satisfying all $4$ conditions divided by the total number of cells, $n$:\n$$\n\\phi = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbf{1}\\{R_i \\ge 0.3, S_i \\ge 0.5, F_i \\ge 0.5, c_i \\le 0.25\\}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{1}\\{\\cdot\\}$ is the indicator function.\n\nWe will now apply this procedure to each of the $5$ test cases provided.\n\n**Test Case 1**:\nThe expression vectors are $S = [\\,0.10, 0.20, 0.15, 0.12, 0.18, 0.20\\,]$ and $F = [\\,0.08, 0.22, 0.14, 0.10, 0.16, 0.18\\,]$. All values for $S_i$ and $F_i$ are below the minimum thresholds $S_{\\min} = 0.5$ and $F_{\\min} = 0.5$. Therefore, no cells satisfy the conditions $S_i \\ge 0.5$ and $F_i \\ge 0.5$. The number of committed cells is $0$.\nThe committed fraction is $\\phi_1 = 0/6 = 0.0$.\n\n**Test Case 2**:\nThe dataset contains $n=6$ cells. We analyze each cell:\n- Cells $1$, $2$, and $5$ have $S_i < 0.5$ and $F_i < 0.5$, failing the minimum expression criteria. They are not committed.\n- Cell $3$: $S_3=2.0, F_3=2.1, N_3=0.2$. All four conditions are met: $S_3 \\ge 0.5$, $F_3 \\ge 0.5$, $R_3 \\approx 1.31 \\ge 0.3$, and $c_3 \\approx 0.024 \\le 0.25$. This cell is committed.\n- Cell $4$: $S_4=1.8, F_4=1.9, N_4=0.3$. All four conditions are met: $S_4 \\ge 0.5$, $F_4 \\ge 0.5$, $R_4 \\approx 1.09 \\ge 0.3$, and $c_4 \\approx 0.027 \\le 0.25$. This cell is committed.\n- Cell $6$: $S_6=2.2, F_6=2.0, N_6=0.1$. All four conditions are met: $S_6 \\ge 0.5$, $F_6 \\ge 0.5$, $R_6 \\approx 1.62 \\ge 0.3$, and $c_6 \\approx 0.048 \\le 0.25$. This cell is committed.\nThere are $3$ committed cells out of $6$.\nThe committed fraction is $\\phi_2 = 3/6 = 0.5$.\n\n**Test Case 3**:\nThe dataset contains $n=6$ cells. We analyze each cell:\n- Cells $4$ and $5$ have $S_i < 0.5$ and $F_i < 0.5$, failing the minimum expression criteria. They are not committed.\n- Cell $1$: $S_1=2.0, F_1=2.1, N_1=0.2$. This cell is committed, as shown in Test Case $2$.\n- Cell $2$: $S_2=1.9, F_2=2.0, N_2=0.25$. All four conditions are met: $S_2 \\ge 0.5$, $F_2 \\ge 0.5$, $R_2 \\approx 1.19 \\ge 0.3$, and $c_2 \\approx 0.026 \\le 0.25$. This cell is committed.\n- Cell $3$: $S_3=3.0, F_3=0.7, N_3=0.2$. This cell passes the minimum expression and log-ratio conditions ($R_3 \\approx 1.27 \\ge 0.3$), but fails the coherence criterion: $c_3 = |3.0-0.7|/(3.0+0.7+\\delta) \\approx 0.622 > 0.25$. This cell is not committed.\n- Cell $6$: $S_6=2.1, F_6=2.05, N_6=0.15$. All four conditions are met: $S_6 \\ge 0.5$, $F_6 \\ge 0.5$, $R_6 \\approx 1.44 \\ge 0.3$, and $c_6 \\approx 0.012 \\le 0.25$. This cell is committed.\nThere are $3$ committed cells out of $6$.\nThe committed fraction is $\\phi_3 = 3/6 = 0.5$.\n\n**Test Case 4**:\nThe dataset contains $n=6$ cells. For all cells, $S_i$ and $F_i$ are high (near $2.0$), while $N_i$ is low (near $0.2$). The difference $|S_i - F_i|$ is small.\n- All cells satisfy $S_i \\ge 0.5$ and $F_i \\ge 0.5$.\n- For all cells, the ratio $(S_i+F_i+\\kappa)/(N_i+\\kappa)$ is large, making all $R_i > 0.3$. The minimum $R_i \\approx \\log_{10}((1.90+2.00+0.001)/(0.25+0.001)) \\approx 1.19 > 0.3$.\n- For all cells, the coherence score $c_i$ is small. The maximum value is $c_1 \\approx |2.1-2.0|/(2.1+2.0) \\approx 0.0244 \\le 0.25$.\nAll $6$ cells meet all $4$ criteria and are classified as committed.\nThe committed fraction is $\\phi_4 = 6/6 = 1.0$.\n\n**Test Case 5**:\nThe dataset contains $n=6$ cells. Here, $S_i=1.0$ for all cells, while $F_i \\approx 2.0$.\n- All cells satisfy $S_i \\ge 0.5$ and $F_i \\ge 0.5$.\n- The log-ratio condition is also satisfied by all cells. The minimum $R_i \\approx \\log_{10}((1.0+2.05+0.001)/(0.32+0.001)) \\approx 0.98 > 0.3$.\n- However, the coherence criterion fails for all cells. The difference $|S_i - F_i|$ is approximately $1.0$, while the sum $S_i+F_i$ is approximately $3.0$. The coherence score is $c_i \\approx 1.0/3.0 \\approx 0.333$, which is greater than $\\eta=0.25$. For instance, for cell $1$, $c_1 = |1.0-2.0|/(1.0+2.0+\\delta) \\approx 0.333 > 0.25$.\nNo cells satisfy the coherence criterion. The number of committed cells is $0$.\nThe committed fraction is $\\phi_5 = 0/6 = 0.0$.\n\nThe final computed fractions are $\\phi_1=0.0$, $\\phi_2=0.5$, $\\phi_3=0.5$, $\\phi_4=1.0$, and $\\phi_5=0.0$.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the fraction of endoderm-committed cells for a suite of test cases\n    based on a defined quantitative classification criterion.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # (Sox17 expr, FoxA2 expr, Nanog expr)\n        # Test case 1 (low-dose, expected uncommitted)\n        (\n            [0.10, 0.20, 0.15, 0.12, 0.18, 0.20],\n            [0.08, 0.22, 0.14, 0.10, 0.16, 0.18],\n            [1.00, 0.90, 1.10, 1.20, 0.95, 1.05]\n        ),\n        # Test case 2 (intermediate dose, mixed state)\n        (\n            [0.10, 0.20, 2.00, 1.80, 0.15, 2.20],\n            [0.12, 0.25, 2.10, 1.90, 0.11, 2.00],\n            [1.20, 1.10, 0.20, 0.30, 1.30, 0.10]\n        ),\n        # Test case 3 (intermediate-high dose with imbalance edge case)\n        (\n            [2.00, 1.90, 3.00, 0.20, 0.15, 2.10],\n            [2.10, 2.00, 0.70, 0.22, 0.10, 2.05],\n            [0.20, 0.25, 0.20, 1.10, 1.20, 0.15]\n        ),\n        # Test case 4 (high dose, fully committed)\n        (\n            [2.10, 1.95, 2.05, 2.00, 1.90, 2.20],\n            [2.00, 2.05, 2.10, 1.95, 2.00, 2.15],\n            [0.10, 0.20, 0.15, 0.25, 0.18, 0.12]\n        ),\n        # Test case 5 (robustness to degenerate dispersion in one marker)\n        (\n            [1.00, 1.00, 1.00, 1.00, 1.00, 1.00],\n            [2.00, 1.90, 2.10, 2.05, 1.95, 2.00],\n            [0.30, 0.25, 0.28, 0.32, 0.26, 0.27]\n        )\n    ]\n\n    # Model constants and thresholds\n    kappa = 1e-3\n    delta = 1e-9\n    tau = 0.3\n    S_min = 0.5\n    F_min = 0.5\n    eta = 0.25\n\n    results = []\n    for s_expr, f_expr, n_expr in test_cases:\n        S = np.array(s_expr)\n        F = np.array(f_expr)\n        N = np.array(n_expr)\n        \n        num_cells = len(S)\n\n        if num_cells == 0:\n            results.append(0.0)\n            continue\n\n        # Condition 1: Log-ratio endoderm commitment index\n        R = np.log10((S + F + kappa) / (N + kappa))\n        cond1 = (R >= tau)\n        \n        # Condition 2: Sox17 expression threshold\n        cond2 = (S >= S_min)\n        \n        # Condition 3: FoxA2 expression threshold\n        cond3 = (F >= F_min)\n\n        # Condition 4: Marker-coherence score\n        c = np.abs(S - F) / (S + F + delta)\n        cond4 = (c = eta)\n        \n        # A cell is committed if all four conditions hold\n        committed_mask = cond1  cond2  cond3  cond4\n        \n        num_committed = np.sum(committed_mask)\n        \n        fraction_committed = num_committed / num_cells\n        results.append(fraction_committed)\n\n    # Format output as a comma-separated list of floats inside brackets\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2634294"}]}
