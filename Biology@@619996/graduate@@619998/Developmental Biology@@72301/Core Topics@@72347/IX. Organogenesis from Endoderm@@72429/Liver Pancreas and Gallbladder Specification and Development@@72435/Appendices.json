It presents a clear, self-contained, and scientifically grounded question based on a standard model in systems biology—the Hill function—to describe a dose-response relationship in gene expression. The objective is to derive a minimal ligand concentration based on a well-defined threshold condition. The problem is well-posed and free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe task is to find the minimal ligand concentration, denoted as $S^{*}$, that is required to induce definitive endoderm. The condition for induction is that the transcriptional response of both genes, Sox17 and Foxa2, must be at least a fraction $\\theta$ of their maximal output. Since both genes are assumed to follow the same response function $f(S)$ with identical parameters, this condition simplifies to a single requirement on $f(S)$.\n\nThe transcriptional response is given by the Hill function:\n$$f(S) = \\frac{S^{n}}{K^{n} + S^{n}}$$\nThe maximal transcriptional output corresponds to the limit of $f(S)$ as $S \\to \\infty$:\n$$\\lim_{S\\to\\infty} f(S) = \\lim_{S\\to\\infty} \\frac{S^{n}}{K^{n} + S^{n}} = \\lim_{S\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\frac{K^{n}}{S^{n}} + 1} = \\frac{1}{0 + 1} = 1$$\nThus, the maximal output is $1$. The condition for induction is that the response must be at least a fraction $\\theta$ of this maximum. This gives the inequality:\n$$f(S) \\ge \\theta$$\nSubstituting the expression for $f(S)$, we have:\n$$\\frac{S^{n}}{K^{n} + S^{n}} \\ge \\theta$$\nWe seek the *minimal* concentration $S^{*}$ that satisfies this condition. The Hill function $f(S)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $S$ for $S>0$, $K>0$, and $n>0$. Therefore, the minimal concentration $S^{*}$ is the value of $S$ for which the equality holds. Any concentration $S > S^{*}$ will yield a response $f(S) > \\theta$. We solve the equation:\n$$\\frac{(S^{*})^{n}}{K^{n} + (S^{*})^{n}} = \\theta$$\nTo solve for $S^{*}$, we perform algebraic rearrangement.\nFirst, multiply both sides by the denominator:\n$$(S^{*})^{n} = \\theta (K^{n} + (S^{*})^{n})$$\nDistribute $\\theta$ on the right side:\n$$(S^{*})^{n} = \\theta K^{n} + \\theta (S^{*})^{n}$$\nGroup the terms containing $S^{*}$:\n$$(S^{*})^{n} - \\theta (S^{*})^{n} = \\theta K^{n}$$\nFactor out $(S^{*})^{n}$:\n$$(S^{*})^{n} (1 - \\theta) = \\theta K^{n}$$\nIsolate $(S^{*})^{n}$. Given that $0  \\theta  1$, the term $(1 - \\theta)$ is non-zero.\n$$(S^{*})^{n} = \\frac{\\theta}{1 - \\theta} K^{n}$$\nFinally, take the $n$-th root of both sides. Since concentrations must be positive, we take the principal (positive real) root:\n$$S^{*} = \\left( \\frac{\\theta}{1 - \\theta} K^{n} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}}$$\n$$S^{*} = K \\left( \\frac{\\theta}{1 - \\theta} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}}$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the minimal ligand concentration $S^{*}$ in terms of $K$, $n$, and $\\theta$. Since the term involving $\\theta$ is dimensionless, the units of $S^{*}$ are the same as the units of $K$. If $K$ is in nanomolar (nM), then $S^{*}$ is also in nanomolar (nM).\n\nA brief biological interpretation of this result is as follows:\nThe minimal concentration $S^{*}$ is directly proportional to $K$. The parameter $K$ represents the intrinsic sensitivity of the response system; a higher $K$ signifies a lower sensitivity, thus requiring a higher concentration of ligand to reach the threshold $\\theta$.\nThe Hill coefficient $n$ governs the steepness, or cooperativity, of the response. A higher value of $n$ leads to a more switch-like response. The effect of $n$ on $S^{*}$ depends on $\\theta$. For $\\theta > 0.5$, the base $\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}$ is greater than $1$, so increasing $n$ decreases the term $(\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta})^{\\frac{1}{n}}$, bringing it closer to $1$ and thus making $S^{*}$ closer to $K$. This sharpens the concentration window in which activation occurs. A high $n$ ensures that the cell makes a decisive fate choice over a very narrow range of ligand concentrations, preventing ambiguous intermediate states.\nThe condition under which $S^{*} = K$ occurs when the term in parentheses equals $1$:\n$$\\left( \\frac{\\theta}{1 - \\theta} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}} = 1$$\nThis implies:\n$$\\frac{\\theta}{1 - \\theta} = 1$$\n$$ \\theta = 1 - \\theta $$\n$$ 2\\theta = 1 $$\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThis result is consistent with the definition of $K$ as the ligand concentration that produces a half-maximal response.
