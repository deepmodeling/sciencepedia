In tissues where multiple chromatin- and receptor-associated steps must be engaged, the steady-state dose–response to ligand is expected to be a monotonic sigmoid that reflects receptor occupancy and any effective cooperativity of the underlying molecular assembly. You are provided with normalized dose–response measurements for two metamorphic endpoints measured after sufficient time to reach a quasi-steady state: gill resorption in a salamander and tail resorption in Xenopus. For each tissue, the measured response $f$ is the fraction of the tissue resorbed (dimensionless, normalized so that baseline is $0$ and saturation is $1$) as a function of free $T_{3}$ concentration $[T_{3}]$ (in nanomolar, nM). The datasets are:\n\n- Salamander gill resorption:\n  - $[T_{3}] = 0.316$ nM, $f = \\frac{1}{101}$\n  - $[T_{3}] = 1.00$ nM, $f = \\frac{1}{11}$\n  - $[T_{3}] = 3.16$ nM, $f = \\frac{1}{2}$\n  - $[T_{3}] = 10.0$ nM, $f = \\frac{10}{11}$\n\n- Xenopus tail resorption:\n  - $[T_{3}] = 0.100$ nM, $f = \\frac{1}{101}$\n  - $[T_{3}] = 1.00$ nM, $f = \\frac{1}{11}$\n  - $[T_{3}] = 10.0$ nM, $f = \\frac{1}{2}$\n  - $[T_{3}] = 100.0$ nM, $f = \\frac{10}{11}$\n\nAssume that the response arises from receptor-mediated control with possible effective cooperativity and that the normalization accurately sets the baseline and maximal response to $0$ and $1$, respectively.\n\nTasks:\n1. Starting from the law of mass action applied to receptor–ligand occupancy and the definition of half-maximal effective concentration, derive a linearizable relationship that connects the normalized response $f$ to $\\log_{10}([T_{3}])$ in which the slope equals an effective cooperativity index and the intercept encodes the half-maximal concentration $EC_{50}$.\n2.

There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of fundamental principles. The data are provided in a form that suggests an underlying exact mathematical relationship, which is a common pedagogical method for testing core concepts without the distraction of experimental noise. The problem is therefore valid, and I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for three tasks: first, to derive a linearizable form of a dose-response model; second, to use this form to estimate parameters for two given datasets; and third, to compute a scalar index from these parameters. The underlying model for a sigmoidal dose-response curve with effective cooperativity is the Hill equation.\n\nTask 1: Derivation of the linearizable relationship.\n\nThe steady-state normalized response $f$ as a function of ligand concentration, in this case $[T_3]$, can be described by the Hill equation:\n$$f = \\frac{[T_3]^n}{(EC_{50})^n + [T_3]^n}$$\nHere, $EC_{50}$ is the half-maximal effective concentration, which is the concentration of $[T_3]$ that produces $50\\%$ of the maximal response (i.e., $f=0.5$). The parameter $n$ is the Hill coefficient, which quantifies the effective cooperativity of the response. A value of $n>1$ indicates positive cooperativity, $n<1$ indicates negative cooperativity, and $n=1$ corresponds to a non-cooperative Michaelis-Menten type of binding.\n\nTo derive the linear relationship requested, we rearrange the Hill equation to isolate a term linear in $\\log_{10}([T_3])$.\nFirst, we solve for the ratio of the response to the non-response, $\\frac{f}{1-f}$:\n$$1 - f = 1 - \\frac{[T_3]^n}{(EC_{50})^n + [T_3]^n} = \\frac{(EC_{50})^n + [T_3]^n - [T_3]^n}{(EC_{50})^n + [T_3]^n} = \\frac{(EC_{50})^n}{(EC_{50})^n + [T_3]^n}$$\nNow, we take the ratio:\n$$\\frac{f}{1-f} = \\frac{[T_3]^n / ((EC_{50})^n + [T_3]^n)}{(EC_{50})^n / ((EC_{50})^n + [T_3]^n)} = \\frac{[T_3]^n}{(EC_{50})^n} = \\left(\\frac{[T_3]}{EC_{50}}\\right)^n$$\nThis expression is the basis for the \"Hill plot\".

Equivalently, the x-intercept of this line (where $y=0$) gives $x = \\log_{10}(EC_{50})$ directly. This completes the first task.\n\nTask 2: Estimation of $n$ and $EC_{50}$ for each dataset.\n\nWe will now transform the provided data for both salamander and Xenopus systems according to the derived linear relationship and determine the parameters by a linear fit.

In the absence of $T_3$, TR recruits nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) and silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) complexes to repress transcription; in the presence of $T_3$, TR releases corepressors and recruits steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) and histone acetyltransferase p300 complexes to activate transcription. This dual-function model posits that unliganded TR prevents precocious metamorphic gene expression by repression, whereas liganded TR induces metamorphic remodeling by activation. Tissue competence is further shaped by local thyroid hormone metabolism via type 2 deiodinase ($D_2$), which activates thyroxine ($T_4$) to $T_3$, and type 3 deiodinase ($D_3$), which inactivates $T_3$.\n\nConsider transgenic frog tadpoles ubiquitously expressing a dominant-negative TR variant engineered with an activation function helix AF-2 mutation that preserves DNA binding to TREs and corepressor interaction but abolishes coactivator recruitment even when $T_3$ is bound.

The $\\text{TR}$ forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor ($\\text{RXR}$). The $\\text{TR-RXR}$ complex binds to thyroid hormone response elements ($\\text{TREs}$).\n- **Dual-Function Model:**\n    - Without $\\text{T}_3$: $\\text{TR}$ binds corepressors ($\\text{NCoR}$, $\\text{SMRT}$) and represses transcription.\n    - With $\\text{T}_3$: $\\text{TR}$ releases corepressors and recruits coactivators ($\\text{SRC}$, $\\text{p}300$) to activate transcription.\n- **Local Metabolism:** Type $2$ deiodinase ($\\text{D}_2$) converts thyroxine ($\\text{T}_4$) to $\\text{T}_3$. Type $3$ deiodinase ($\\text{D}_3$) inactivates $\\text{T}_3$.\n- **Experimental System:** Transgenic tadpoles express a dominant-negative $\\text{TR}$ ($\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$) ubiquitously at metamorphic climax.\n- **Properties of $\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$:**\n    1. It has a mutation in the activation function helix $\\text{AF-2}$.\n    2. It preserves DNA binding to $\\text{TREs}$.\n    3. It preserves interaction with corepressors.\n    4. It abolishes recruitment of coactivators, even when bound to $\\text{T}_3$.\n- **Mechanism of Action:** The $\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$ competes with endogenous, wild-type $\\text{TR}$ for binding to $\\text{TREs}$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded in the accepted molecular mechanisms of nuclear hormone receptor function and developmental endocrinology. The dual-function model of $\\text{TR}$ is a central paradigm in the field. The design of the dominant-negative receptor with a defective $\\text{AF-2}$ domain is a classic and valid experimental strategy to dissect receptor function. The setup is self-contained, logically consistent, and unambiguous. It provides all necessary information to deduce the consequences of expressing such a protein. The problem is well-posed and does not violate any principles of scientific validity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution can be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Correct Answer**\n\nThe core of the problem is to understand the function of the engineered dominant-negative receptor ($\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$) and its impact on gene expression during metamorphosis.\n\n1.  **Analysis of $\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$ Function:** The $\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$ is designed to act as a competitive inhibitor of the wild-type $\\text{TR}$ ($\\text{TR}_{\\text{WT}}$). It binds to the same DNA targets, the $\\text{TREs}$.\n    - In the absence of the hormone $\\text{T}_3$ (pre-metamorphosis), both $\\text{TR}_{\\text{WT}}$ and $\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$ can bind corepressors and mediate transcriptional repression. The repressed state of metamorphic genes is maintained.\n    - In the presence of $\\text{T}_3$ (metamorphic climax), the scenario changes. When $\\text{TR}_{\\text{WT}}$ binds $\\text{T}_3$, it dismisses corepressors and recruits coactivators, leading to strong transcriptional activation. When the competing $\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$ binds to a $\\text{TRE}$, it also binds $\\text{T}_3$ and releases corepressors (the standard action of a liganded nuclear receptor, necessary for the \"dominant negative\" effect at this stage). However, due to its $\\text{AF-2}$ mutation, it is critically unable to recruit coactivators.\n    - Consequently, at a target gene promoter occupied by $\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$, the gene is derepressed but not actively transcribed. The strong \"activate\" signal from $\\text{T}_3$ is converted into a \"neutral\" or \"off\" signal. This effectively blocks the ability of $\\text{T}_3$ to induce high levels of gene expression required for metamorphosis.\n\n2.  **Application to Metamorphic Events:** Amphibian metamorphosis involves processes that are known to be dependent on robust, $\\text{T}_3$-induced gene activation, not merely the lifting of repression.\n    - **Degeneration of Larval Tissues (Tail, Gills):** These events are driven by programmed cell death (apoptosis), which is an active process requiring the synthesis of numerous proteins, such as caspases and matrix metalloproteinases. The genes encoding these proteins must be strongly activated by liganded $\\text{TR}$. The $\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$ will prevent this activation, thus **inhibiting** tail resorption and gill regression.\n    - **Remodeling of Larval Tissues (Intestine):** This process is complex, involving the apoptosis of the larval epithelium and the simultaneous proliferation and differentiation of adult stem cells. Both the destructive (apoptosis) and constructive (proliferation/differentiation) phases require specific sets of genes to be activated by $\\text{T}_3$. The $\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$ will inhibit both processes.\n    - **De Novo Growth of Adult Tissues (Limbs):** The rapid growth and patterning of limbs during metamorphic climax are critically dependent on the activation of a cascade of developmental genes by $\\text{T}_3$. Blocking this activation will severely impede or arrest limb development.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The expression of this $\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$ will act as a potent antagonist to $\\text{T}_3$ action, leading to a general inhibition of all major metamorphic events.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Tail resorption and gill regression proceed largely normally; apoptosis of the larval intestinal epithelium is markedly inhibited; limb growth is severely stunted. Interpretation: tail and gill remodeling rely primarily on derepression by removing corepressors, whereas intestinal and limb remodeling require transcriptional activation.**\nThis option is **Incorrect**. The prediction that tail and gill regression proceed normally is flawed. These large-scale apoptotic events require active gene expression programs, meaning they depend on transcriptional activation, not just derepression. The interpretation is based on this false premise.\n\n**B. Tail resorption and gill regression are strongly inhibited; both apoptosis of the larval intestinal epithelium and expansion of adult intestinal stem cells are inhibited; limb growth and patterning continue but are delayed. Interpretation: tail and gill remodeling require TR-dependent transcriptional activation by liganded TR, whereas limb development can proceed to a degree when derepression permits integration of non-thyroidal cues.**\nThis option is **Correct**. The predicted phenotypes (inhibition of tail, gill, and intestinal remodeling; delay/stunting of limbs) are fully consistent with the mechanism of the $\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$ blocking transcriptional activation. The interpretation is sound: it correctly identifies that these processes require activation by liganded $\\text{TR}$. It also provides a sophisticated and plausible explanation for a partial limb phenotype, acknowledging that other signaling pathways might have a minor effect once repression is lifted, even without full $\\text{TR}$-mediated activation. This represents the most accurate and nuanced understanding of the system.\n\n**C. All tissues exhibit precocious metamorphic changes, including accelerated tail resorption, gill regression, intestinal remodeling, and limb development. Interpretation: TR acts solely as a repressor premetamorphically, so preventing coactivator recruitment mimics derepression and advances metamorphosis.**\nThis option is **Incorrect**. The prediction of precocious metamorphosis is the opposite of the expected outcome. The $\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$ is an inhibitor, not an activator. The interpretation wrongly discards the essential role of coactivator-mediated transcriptional activation, which is explicitly described in the problem's dual-function model.\n\n**D. Tail resorption is strongly inhibited but gill regression is largely normal; intestinal larval epithelial apoptosis proceeds but adult stem cell expansion fails; limb development is unaffected. Interpretation: coactivator recruitment is dispensable for regression of larval tissues but required for neogenesis of adult tissues.**\nThis option is **Incorrect**. The predicted phenotypes are inconsistent. There is no sound biological reason for tail and gill regression to be differentially affected, nor for intestinal apoptosis to proceed while tail apoptosis is inhibited. The interpretation relies on the faulty premise that regression (apoptosis) does not require coactivator recruitment (activation), which contradicts the understanding of apoptosis as an active, gene-directed process.\n\n**E. No overt phenotype is expected in any tissue because endogenous T$3$ levels are unchanged; interpretation: dominant-negative TRs require loss of hormone binding or altered deiodinase activity to affect metamorphosis, and a coactivator-deficient TR cannot interfere with endogenous TR function in vivo.**\nThis option is **Incorrect**. A ubiquitously expressed dominant-negative receptor that competes for DNA binding is expected to cause a strong phenotype. The interpretation contains multiple errors. A dominant-negative receptor does not need to lose hormone binding to function; in fact, binding the hormone but failing to activate is a common mechanism. Most critically, it incorrectly claims the $\\text{TR}_{\\text{DN}}$ cannot interfere with endogenous $\\text{TR}$; its interference via competition for $\\text{TREs}$ is the very definition of its dominant-negative action.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2685189"}, {"introduction": "Metamorphosis orchestrates the behavior of millions of cells, raising a crucial question: does each cell respond to thyroid hormone independently, or do cells communicate the signal to their neighbors?

The validity of the problem statement must be assessed first.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n*   **Biological System:** *Xenopus* tail resorption during metamorphosis.\n*   **Inducer:** Triiodothyronine ($T_3$) at a saturating dose of $10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n*   **Core Mechanism:** $T_3$ binds to the Thyroid Hormone Receptor (TR), a nuclear transcription factor.\n*   **Principle (i):** Cell-intrinsic response requires $T_3$-bound TR within the same cell to activate the metamorphic gene program. Unliganded TR is a repressor. This defines the basis for cell-autonomous action.\n*   **Principle (ii):** $T_3$-responsive cells produce proteases and chemokines, and macrophages infiltrate. This provides a source for non-cell-autonomous signals.\n*   **Definition (iii):** Cell-autonomous effects require a cell's own TR. Non-cell-autonomous effects are mediated by signals from other cells, with a finite effective range, $\\ell$.\n*   **Experimental Model:** Chimeric tails with TR-sufficient ($\\mathrm{TR}^{+/+}$, $\\text{GFP}^+$) and TR-deficient ($\\mathrm{TR}^{-/-}$, $\\text{RFP}^+$) cells.\n*   **Spatial Architectures:**\n    1.  Small, intermingled patches with characteristic diameter $d \\approx 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n    2.  Large, segregated domains with characteristic diameter $d \\approx 200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n*   **Signaling Length Scale:** The effective range of non-cell-autonomous factors is $\\ell \\approx 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. Note that for small patches, $d \\ll \\ell$, and for large patches, $d \\gg \\ell$.\n*   **Primary Readout:** Apoptosis quantified by activated caspase staining at $t = 24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ post-$T_3$ treatment.\n*   **Quantitative Readouts:** (a) Apoptosis fractions in $\\text{GFP}^+$ and $\\text{RFP}^+$ cells under both mosaic architectures. (b) For large patches, apoptosis of $\\text{RFP}^+$ cells as a function of distance to the $\\text{GFP}^+$ boundary. (c) Apoptosis of $\\text{RFP}^+$ cells as a function of local $\\text{GFP}^+$ neighbor fraction ($f$) within a radius $r \\approx \\ell$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent.\n1.  **Scientific Grounding:** The described mechanism of thyroid hormone action, its role in metamorphosis, the concepts of cell autonomy and non-cell-autonomy, and the experimental techniques (CRISPR mosaics, lineage tracing) are all standard and well-established in modern developmental biology.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem is structured to yield a definitive answer. The key is the comparison between two length scales: the size of the genetic patches ($d$) and the signaling range of paracrine factors ($\\ell$). By creating conditions where $d \\ll \\ell$ and $d \\gg \\ell$, one can create distinct environments to isolate and observe cell-autonomous versus non-cell-autonomous effects.\n3.  **Objectivity and Completeness:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms ($d$, $\\ell$, concentrations, time points). All necessary information is provided to reason about the experimental outcomes from first principles. There are no contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. The solution phase will proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe core task is to distinguish two types of effects based on the provided principles.\n\n1.  **Cell-Autonomous Effect:** According to principle (i), a cell's ability to initiate the $T_3$ response program is determined by its own genotype. A $\\mathrm{TR}^{+/+}$ ($\\text{GFP}^+$) cell can respond to $T_3$. A $\\mathrm{TR}^{-/-}$ ($\\text{RFP}^+$) cell cannot. In isolation, a $\\mathrm{TR}^{-/-}$ cell will not undergo apoptosis in response to $T_3$.\n\n2.  **Non-Cell-Autonomous Effect:** According to principle (ii), responding $\\mathrm{TR}^{+/+}$ cells secrete factors (proteases, chemokines) that can influence their neighbors. This effect has a limited spatial range, $\\ell$. Therefore, a non-responding $\\mathrm{TR}^{-/-}$ cell might be induced to undergo apoptosis if it is located sufficiently close (within distance $\\ell$) to a responding $\\mathrm{TR}^{+/+}$ cell.\n\nThis leads to a clear set of predictions based on the experimental design:\n\n*   **In controls:** An all-$\\mathrm{TR}^{+/+}$ tail will show a high, uniform level of apoptosis (the maximal response). An all-$\\mathrm{TR}^{-/-}$ tail will show only a low, baseline level of apoptosis.\n*   **In large-patch mosaics ($d \\gg \\ell$):**\n    *   $\\mathrm{TR}^{-/-}$ ($\\text{RFP}^+$) cells in the interior of a large patch, at a distance greater than $\\ell$ from any $\\mathrm{TR}^{+/+}$ ($\\text{GFP}^+$) cell, will be shielded from non-cell-autonomous signals. Their fate is purely cell-autonomous. They should exhibit only baseline apoptosis.\n    *   $\\mathrm{TR}^{-/-}$ ($\\text{RFP}^+$) cells located near the boundary (within distance $\\ell$) will be exposed to signals from the adjacent $\\mathrm{TR}^{+/+}$ cells. They should exhibit a level of apoptosis that is elevated above baseline, likely in a graded fashion depending on their proximity to the signal source.\n    *   $\\mathrm{TR}^{+/+}$ ($\\text{GFP}^+$) cells will exhibit a high level of apoptosis regardless of their location, as their response is cell-autonomous.\n*   **In small-patch mosaics ($d \\ll \\ell$):**\n    *   Since the patch size $d$ is much smaller than the signaling range $\\ell$, every cell is effectively in a mixed environment.\n    *   $\\mathrm{TR}^{-/-}$ ($\\text{RFP}^+$) cells will be constantly exposed to non-cell-autonomous signals from their nearby $\\mathrm{TR}^{+/+}$ neighbors. They should exhibit an intermediate level of apoptosis: higher than baseline, but lower than the maximal response of $\\mathrm{TR}^{+/+}$ cells because they lack the direct, cell-autonomous pathway.\n    *   $\\mathrm{TR}^{+/+}$ ($\\text{GFP}^+$) cells will still undergo a maximal, cell-autonomous response.\n\nThe ideal experimental design must include both large- and small-patch mosaics to create these distinct signaling contexts and must use single-cell resolution readouts to distinguish the behavior of the two genotypes.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Implement both small-patch ($d \\ll \\ell$) and large-patch ($d \\gg \\ell$) mosaics with $\\text{RFP}^+$ $\\mathrm{TR}^{-/-}$ and $\\text{GFP}^+$ $\\mathrm{TR}^{+/+}$ cells, and measure apoptosis at $t = 24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ as a function of local neighbor composition. Predict that under saturating T3: in all-GFP tails, $\\text{GFP}^+$ apoptosis is $\\approx 80\\%$; in all-RFP tails, $\\text{RFP}^+$ apoptosis is near baseline $\\approx 5\\%$; in small-patch mosaics (typical $f \\approx 0.5$ everywhere), $\\text{RFP}^+$ apoptosis increases to $\\approx 40\\%$ while $\\text{GFP}^+$ remains $\\approx 80\\%$; in large-patch mosaics, $\\text{RFP}^+$ cells deeper than $\\ell$ from $\\text{GFP}^+$ boundaries remain near $\\approx 5\\%$, whereas $\\text{RFP}^+$ cells within $\\ell$ of $\\text{GFP}^+$ boundaries show an approximately linear increase with local $f$, reaching $\\approx 40\\%$ at $f \\approx 0.5$. Define a cell-autonomy index $A = 1 - \\dfrac{P_{\\mathrm{RFP}}}{P_{\\mathrm{GFP}}}$ in small-patch mosaics (at $f \\approx 0.5$), yielding $A \\approx 0.5$, consistent with mixed cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous components.**\nThis option presents an exemplary experimental design. It correctly proposes using both large- and small-patch mosaics to probe different signaling regimes. The predicted quantitative outcomes are entirely consistent with the logical deduction from first principles: maximal response in GFP$^{+}$ cells ($\\approx 80\\%$), baseline in isolated RFP$^{+}$ cells ($\\approx 5\\%$), and an intermediate, rescued response in RFP$^{+}$ cells exposed to neighbors ($\\approx 40\\%$). The predicted gradient of apoptosis near the large-patch boundary is also correct. The proposed cell-autonomy index $A$ is a standard way to quantify such phenomena, where $A=1$ means purely cell-autonomous and $A=0$ means purely non-cell-autonomous. The calculated value of $A = 1 - (40/80) = 0.5$ correctly reflects a mixed contribution.\n**Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Use only small-patch ($d \\ll \\ell$) mosaics and score global tail-length regression over $t = 48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ without single-cell readouts. Predict that because T3 is present systemically, both $\\text{GFP}^+$ and $\\text{RFP}^+$ cells undergo similar apoptosis rates $\\approx 80\\%$, and that the fraction of $\\text{RFP}^+$ cells has no measurable effect on regression slope.**\nThis option is flawed. Firstly, the experimental design is inadequate. A global readout like tail length cannot distinguish the contributions of different cell types, rendering the $\\text{GFP}^+$/$\\text{RFP}^+$ labeling useless. Relying only on small-patch mosaics prevents the isolation of purely cell-autonomous effects, which is possible in the center of large patches. Secondly, the prediction that $\\text{RFP}^+$ cells will have an apoptosis rate of $\\approx 80\\%$ is incorrect; it assumes a perfect non-cell-autonomous rescue, which ignores the necessity of the cell's own TR for the full response (Principle i).\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Generate large-patch ($d \\gg \\ell$) mosaics but analyze apoptosis only in the $\\text{RFP}^+$ islands’ interiors ($>$ $\\ell$ from any boundary). Predict that non-cell-autonomous effects dominate, so that $\\text{RFP}^+$ apoptosis is $\\approx 80\\%$ even when isolated from $\\text{GFP}^+$ cells by distances $\\gg \\ell$, and conclude that TR in a cell is dispensable for tail resorption.**\nThis option contains a fundamental contradiction. It speaks of non-cell-autonomous effects that \"dominate\" but then predicts their action at a distance $\\gg \\ell$, which violates the given definition of a finite signaling range $\\ell$. This is logically inconsistent. An experiment analyzing only the interior of large $\\text{RFP}^+$ patches is precisely the condition where non-cell-autonomous effects should be *absent*, and thus $\\text{RFP}^+$ apoptosis should be at baseline. The prediction and subsequent conclusion are therefore based on flawed reasoning.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Implement small-patch ($d \\ll \\ell$) mosaics and deplete macrophages to eliminate non-cell-autonomous effects, then infer cell autonomy from unchanged $\\text{RFP}^+$ apoptosis. Predict that under saturating T3 without macrophages, $\\text{RFP}^+$ apoptosis will still be $\\approx 40\\%$ and $\\text{GFP}^+$ $\\approx 80\\%$, independent of local $f$, demonstrating partial non-cell-autonomy even when paracrine sources are removed.**\nThis option is poorly conceived. While macrophage depletion is a valid experiment to test the *source* of the non-cell-autonomous signal, this option frames it as the primary method to distinguish autonomy from non-autonomy, which it is not. The prediction that removing a key potential paracrine source (macrophages) has *no effect* on the non-cell-autonomous rescue ($\\text{RFP}^+$ apoptosis remains at $\\approx 40\\%$) is counterintuitive. Furthermore, the conclusion is nonsensical: it claims to demonstrate non-cell-autonomy by showing the effect persists after removing its proposed source. This does not make logical sense.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2685326"}]}
