A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe fundamental principle is the conservation of cell number. In a one-dimensional continuum at steady state, the spatial change in cell flux must be balanced by the net local production of cells. The conservation equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} = S_{\\text{net}} $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the linear cell density, $J = \\rho u(x)$ is the cell flux, and $S_{\\text{net}}$ is the net source rate of cells per unit length.\n\nAt steady state, $\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = 0$. The problem states that cell density $\\rho$ is constant in both space and time. Let $\\rho = \\rho_0$. The conservation equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx}(\\rho_0 u(x)) = S_{\\text{net}} $$\nSince $\\rho_0$ is a constant, we have:\n$$ \\rho_0 \\frac{du}{dx} = S_{\\text{net}} $$\nThe net source rate, $S_{\\text{net}}$, is the rate of cell production (proliferation) minus the rate of cell loss (transition to hypertrophy). Both are given as first-order processes with per-cell rates $r$ and $h$. Thus, the source rate per unit length is $r \\rho_0$ and the sink rate per unit length is $h \\rho_0$.\n$$ S_{\\text{net}} = r \\rho_0 - h \\rho_0 = (r - h) \\rho_0 $$\nSubstituting this into the conservation equation:\n$$ \\rho_0 \\frac{du}{dx} = (r - h) \\rho_0 $$\nAssuming a non-trivial cell population ($\\rho_0 \\ne 0$), we can divide by $\\rho_0$:\n$$ \\frac{du}{dx} = r - h $$\nThis is an ordinary differential equation for the tissue velocity $u(x)$. We integrate with respect to $x$ to find the velocity field:\n$$ u(x) = \\int (r - h) dx = (r - h)x + C $$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. We use the proximal boundary condition, $u(0)=0$, to determine $C$:\n$$ u(0) = (r - h)(0) + C = 0 \\implies C=0 $$\nThus, the velocity field within the proliferative zone is:\n$$ u(x) = (r - h)x $$\nThis expression is valid for $x \\in [0, L^{\\ast}]$. Now, we apply the distal boundary condition at $x=L^{\\ast}$, which states that the tissue velocity at the transition boundary equals the overall column lengthening rate, $u(L^{\\ast})=v$.\n$$ v = (r - h)L^{\\ast} $$\nThis gives the desired expression for the steady-state proliferative-zone length $L^{\\ast}$:\n$$ L^{\\ast} = \\frac{v}{r-h} $$\nFor this model to be physically sensible, we must have $r>h$, ensuring that net cell production occurs in the proliferative zone, driving expansion and positive tissue velocity. The given baseline parameters ($r=0.8\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$, $h=0.4\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$) satisfy this condition.\n\nNow, we compute the fold-change $F \\equiv \\frac{L^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{FGFR3}}}{L^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{baseline}}}$.\nThe baseline length is:\n$$ L^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{baseline}} = \\frac{v}{r-h} $$\nThe length under FGFR3 activation is given by the same formula with the primed parameters:\n$$ L^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{FGFR3}} = \\frac{v'}{r'-h'} $$\nThe fold-change is the ratio of these two quantities:\n$$ F = \\frac{L^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{FGFR3}}}{L^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{baseline}}} = \\frac{v'/(r'-h')}{v/(r-h)} = \\frac{v'}{v} \\cdot \\frac{r-h}{r'-h'} $$\nWe are given the relationships between the primed and baseline parameters:\n- $v' = \\gamma v$\n- $r' = (1-\\eta)r$\n- $h' = (1+\\xi)h$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $F$:\n$$ F = \\frac{\\gamma v}{v} \\cdot \\frac{r-h}{(1-\\eta)r - (1+\\xi)h} = \\gamma \\left( \\frac{r-h}{(1-\\eta)r - (1+\\xi)h} \\right) $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $r=0.8$, $h=0.4$, $\\gamma=0.2$, $\\eta=0.25$, and $\\xi=0.25$.\nFirst, calculate the denominator of the fraction within the parentheses:\n$$ (1-\\eta)r - (1+\\xi)h = (1-0.25)(0.8) - (1+0.25)(0.4) $$\n$$ = (0.75)(0.8) - (1.25)(0.4) $$\n$$ = 0.6 - 0.5 = 0.1 $$\nThe numerator is:\n$$ r-h = 0.8 - 0.4 = 0.4 $$\nNow, substitute these back into the expression for $F$:\n$$ F = \\gamma \\left( \\frac{0.4}{0.1} \\right) = 0.2 \\cdot (4) = 0.8 $$\nThe problem asks for the result as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.

Therefore, the inequality $P(x) \\le 0$ is satisfied for $x$ values between the two roots, i.e., $x \\in [x_1, x_2]$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the smaller and larger roots, respectively.\n\nLet us compute the roots:\n$$\nx_1 = \\frac{\\beta - \\sqrt{\\Delta}}{2\\gamma} = \\frac{0.015 - \\sqrt{0.000161}}{2(0.002)} = \\frac{0.015 - 0.012688577...}{0.004} \\approx 0.577856 \\text{ mm}\n$$\n$$\nx_2 = \\frac{\\beta + \\sqrt{\\Delta}}{2\\gamma} = \\frac{0.015 + \\sqrt{0.000161}}{2(0.002)} = \\frac{0.015 + 0.012688577...}{0.004} \\approx 6.922144 \\text{ mm}\n$$\nThe osteogenic activation occurs for $x \\in [x_1, x_2] \\approx [0.577856, 6.922144]$.\n\nThe spatial activation set, $\\mathcal{A}$, is the subset of the tissue domain $[0,L] = [0,6]$ where activation occurs. This is the intersection of the solution interval with the tissue domain:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A} = [x_1, x_2] \\cap [0, L]\n$$\nUsing the computed values:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A} \\approx [0.577856, 6.922144] \\cap [0, 6]\n$$\nSince $x_1 \\approx 0.577856$ is within $[0,6]$ and $x_2 \\approx 6.922144$ is greater than $6$, the intersection is the interval $[x_1, 6]$.\n$$\n\\mathcal{A} = [x_1, L] \\approx [0.577856, 6] \\text{ mm}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\nFor the second part, we compute the fraction $f$ of the tissue length that is osteogenically activated. This fraction is the length (Lebesgue measure) of $\\mathcal{A}$ divided by the total tissue length $L$.\n$$\n\\text{length}(\\mathcal{A}) = L - x_1\n$$\n$$\nf = \\frac{\\text{length}(\\mathcal{A})}{L} = \\frac{L - x_1}{L} = 1 - \\frac{x_1}{L}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\nf = 1 - \\frac{0.577856...}{6} \\approx 1 - 0.096309... \\approx 0.9036907...\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $f \\approx 0.9037$.\n\nFor the third part, we must justify qualitatively how the location of the entry boundary, $x_1$, depends on the threshold $\\epsilon^{\\ast}$. The boundary points are defined implicitly by the equation $\\epsilon(x) = \\epsilon^{\\ast}$. The strain function $\\epsilon(x) = \\epsilon_c + \\beta x - \\gamma x^2$ describes an inverted parabola with its peak at $x_v = \\frac{\\beta}{2\\gamma} = \\frac{0.015}{2(0.002)} = 3.75$ mm. The entry boundary $x_1 \\approx 0.578$ mm is located on the rising portion of this curve ($x < x_v$), where the function $\\epsilon(x)$ is monotonically increasing. For the equality $\\epsilon(x_1) = \\epsilon^{\\ast}$ to hold, if the threshold value $\\epsilon^{\\ast}$ is increased, the corresponding position $x_1$ must also increase to reach this higher strain value. Thus, the entry boundary $x_1$ is a monotonically increasing function of $\\epsilon^{\\ast}$. An increase in the required activation threshold pushes the boundary of the activated region further into the tissue, thereby reducing the size of the region $\\mathcal{A}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9037}$$", "id": "2659625"}]}
