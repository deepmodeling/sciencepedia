Consider a single somite approximated as a right circular cylinder of radius $R$, with SHH entering uniformly from the external boundary and diffusing radially inward into the tissue, where it is removed by first-order degradation. In a homogeneous medium at steady state with diffusion coefficient $D$ and first-order degradation rate constant $k$, the radially inward concentration profile along a radius can be modeled as $S(x)=S_{0}\\exp(-x/\\lambda)$ for $x \\in [0,R]$, where $x$ is the inward distance from the boundary, $S_{0}$ is the boundary concentration at $x=0$, and $\\lambda=\\sqrt{D/k}$ is the diffusion length.

The condition for activation is the inequality $S(x) \\geq S_t$, where $S_t$ is a constant positive threshold concentration.\n$2$. The concentration profile of the morphogen as a function of inward distance $x$ from the boundary is given by the function $S(x) = S_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$ for $x \\in [0, R]$, where $S_0$ is the boundary concentration and $\\lambda$ is the diffusion length.\n$3$. The parameters satisfy the conditions $S_0 > S_t$ and $\\lambda \\ln(S_0/S_t) < R$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from first principles by solving the governing inequality for the variable $x$. We begin by substituting the given expression for $S(x)$ into the activation condition:\n$$S_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) \\geq S_t$$\nGiven that $S_0$ is a positive concentration, we can divide both sides of the inequality by $S_0$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) \\geq \\frac{S_t}{S_0}$$\nTo isolate the variable $x$ from the exponent, we apply the natural logarithm function, $\\ln$, to both sides. The natural logarithm is a monotonically increasing function, so the application preserves the direction of the inequality:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\\right) \\geq \\ln\\left(\\frac{S_t}{S_0}\\right)$$\nBy the identity $\\ln(\\exp(z)) = z$, the left side simplifies to:\n$$-\\frac{x}{\\lambda} \\geq \\ln\\left(\\frac{S_t}{S_0}\\right)$$\nUsing the logarithmic property $\\ln(a/b) = -\\ln(b/a)$, we can rewrite the right-hand side of the inequality:\n$$-\\frac{x}{\\lambda} \\geq -\\ln\\left(\\frac{S_0}{S_t}\\right)$$\nThe parameter $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$ is the characteristic diffusion length. The diffusion coefficient $D$ and the first-order degradation rate constant $k$ are physical quantities and must be positive, which implies that $\\lambda$ is a positive real number. To solve for $x$, we multiply both sides of the inequality by $-\\lambda$. This operation reverses the direction of the inequality:\n$$x \\leq \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{S_0}{S_t}\\right)$$\nThe variable $x$ represents an inward distance from the boundary of the somite, so it must be non-negative, i.e., $x \\geq 0$. Combining this physical constraint with the derived inequality, we find that the domain of Sox9 activation corresponds to the interval of $x$ values:\n$$0 \\leq x \\leq \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{S_0}{S_t}\\right)$$\nThis interval defines a region of tissue, starting at the boundary ($x=0$) and extending inward. The radial thickness of this activated domain, $w$, is the length of this interval. The length is the value of the upper bound minus the lower bound:\n$$w = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{S_0}{S_t}\\right) - 0$$\nTherefore, the expression for the radial thickness $w$ is:\n$$w = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{S_0}{S_t}\\right)$$\nThe given condition $S_0 > S_t$ ensures that the ratio $S_0/S_t > 1$, which makes its natural logarithm positive, correctly yielding a positive thickness $w > 0$.

This requires $\\min(1.25, -1 + 1.25y) > 0$. This condition implies that both arguments of the $\\min$ function must be positive.

The problem specifies that an anterior shift should be reported as a positive value.\n\nLet the paraxial mesoderm be segmented into somites of uniform length $L$. We can define the interval occupied by somite $s_j$ as $[(j-1)L, jL]$, where $j$ is an integer index. The rostral boundary of somite $s_j$ is at $x = (j-1)L$ and the caudal boundary is at $x = jL$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the baseline condition.

For somite $s_j$, this boundary is at coordinate $x_{bound} = (j-1)L + L/2 = (j-1/2)L$.\n- The rostral compartment of $s_j$ spans the interval $[(j-1)L, (j-1/2)L]$.\n- The caudal compartment of $s_j$ spans the interval $[(j-1/2)L, jL]$.\n\nAccording to the rule of resegmentation, vertebra $v_j$ is formed from the caudal compartment of somite $s_j$ and the rostral compartment of somite $s_{j+1}$.\n- The caudal compartment of $s_j$ is the interval $[(j-1/2)L, jL]$.\n- The rostral compartment of $s_{j+1}$ occupies the interval $[(j+1-1)L, (j+1-1/2)L]$, which simplifies to $[jL, (j+1/2)L]$.\n\nThus, the tissue forming the baseline vertebra $v_j^{base}$ spans the continuous axial interval $[(j-1/2)L, (j+1/2)L]$.
