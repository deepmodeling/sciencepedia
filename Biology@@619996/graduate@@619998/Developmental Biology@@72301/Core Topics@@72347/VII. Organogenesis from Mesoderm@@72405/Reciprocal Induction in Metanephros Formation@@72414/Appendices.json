The MM secretes GDNF at a constant flux $S$ (molecules per unit area per unit time) into the extracellular space.

We proceed to the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Governing Equation**\nWe begin with the principle of mass conservation for the concentration $C(x,t)$ in a one-dimensional control volume element of length $\\Delta x$ and cross-sectional area $A$, located between $x$ and $x + \\Delta x$. The rate of change of the number of molecules in this volume is equal to the net flux into the volume minus the rate of removal.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (C A \\Delta x) = J(x) A - J(x+\\Delta x) A - (kC) A \\Delta x\n$$\nHere, $J(x)$ is the diffusive flux at position $x$, given by Fick's first law as $J(x) = -D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}$.

The premises are internally consistent. For example, it correctly states that removing negative feedback increases signal amplitude and duration.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. It poses a non-trivial question about synergistic gene interactions within a signaling network. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires an analysis of a signal transduction pathway, RET signaling, under compound genetic perturbation. The output of this pathway, branching morphogenesis, is governed by a threshold mechanism where the ERK signal ($E$) must exceed a threshold ($\\theta$).\n\nLet us denote the wild-type state with subscript $WT$. In the wild-type, a baseline level of $Gdnf$ ligand stimulates the RET receptor, leading to a specific amplitude and duration of ERK signal, $E_{WT}$. The intrinsic negative feedback mediated by Spry1 ensures that this signal is appropriately attenuated, such that $E_{WT} > \\theta$ only at precise locations (the tips of the branching UB) and for a limited time, leading to stereotyped branching.\n\nNow, we analyze the two perturbations individually before considering their combined effect.\n\n1.  **Perturbation 1: $2\\times$ Gdnf Expression.**\n    An increase in the ligand concentration to $2\\times$ the normal level will lead to a higher occupancy of RET receptors, resulting in stronger and potentially more widespread receptor activation. This will increase the downstream ERK signal, yielding an output $E_{Gdnf} > E_{WT}$. Consequently, the condition $E > \\theta$ will be met more easily, over a larger spatial domain, and/or for a longer duration. This is known to cause hyper-branching and can induce ectopic buds from the Wolffian duct where RET is also expressed.\n\n2.  **Perturbation 2: Spry1 Null.**\n    Spry1 is an RTK signaling inhibitor that provides negative feedback to attenuate ERK output. Its removal eliminates this braking mechanism. The problem statement correctly formalizes this by stating that loss of negative feedback increases both the amplitude and duration of $E$. Therefore, even with wild-type $Gdnf$ levels, the ERK signal in the Spry1 null mouse, $E_{Spry1}$, will be of higher amplitude and longer duration compared to wild-type: $E_{Spry1} > E_{WT}$. This causes the threshold $\\theta$ to be exceeded for longer times and in ectopic locations, leading to a known phenotype of supernumerary ureters and renal hyper-branching.\n\n3.  **Compound Model: $2\\times$ Gdnf AND Spry1 Null.**\n    We now combine these two perturbations. The system is simultaneously subjected to a stronger initiating signal ($2\\times$ ligand) and a crippled capacity for self-attenuation (no Spry1 feedback). The a priori expectation is a synergistic, or supralinear, effect. The increased GDNF input will generate a powerful initial RET activation. In a normal system, this would be quickly counteracted by feedback inhibition. However, in the absence of Spry1, this strong signal is not effectively attenuated. The result is an ERK signal, $E_{compound}$, that is dramatically amplified in both amplitude and duration, far exceeding the effects of either single perturbation.\n    - Amplitude: $E_{compound}$ will have a much higher peak than either $E_{Gdnf}$ or $E_{Spry1}$.\n    - Duration: The decay of the $E_{compound}$ signal will be much slower than in either single mutant.\n    - Spatial Domain: The combination of high ligand concentration and lack of signal attenuation will cause the domain where $E > \\theta$ to expand significantly, far beyond the normal UB tip region. This will promote bud initiation from normally non-permissive sites, such as the trunk of the ureteric bud and the Wolffian duct.\n\nThe predicted phenotype is therefore a severe hyper-branching of the ureteric tree within the kidney and a high frequency of ectopic ureteric buds.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Strong hyperbranching with markedly increased numbers of branch tips and frequent supernumerary ureteric buds arising ectopically along the Wolffian duct and UB trunks; the combined increase in ligand input and loss of Spry1-mediated negative regulation produces supralinear RETâ€“ERK hyperactivation (higher amplitude and prolonged duration), lowering the effective threshold and broadening the spatial domain over which $E \\gt \\theta$, thereby increasing both branching and ectopic budding beyond either perturbation alone.**\n- This option correctly predicts a severe phenotype (\"strong hyperbranching\", \"frequent supernumerary ureteric buds\"). It correctly identifies the mechanism as a \"supralinear... hyperactivation\" resulting from the combination of increased ligand and loss of negative feedback. It correctly describes the effect on signaling dynamics as \"higher amplitude and prolonged duration\". Finally, it correctly links these dynamics to the threshold model by describing a \"broadening the spatial domain over which $E > \\theta$\". The phrase \"lowering the effective threshold\" is a conceptually correct way to describe the effect of increasing $E$ relative to a fixed $\\theta$. This option perfectly aligns with our derivation.\n- **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Near-normal branching with rare ectopic buds; the loss of Spry1 triggers compensatory desensitization such that RETâ€“ERK signaling is homeostatically downregulated despite $2\\times$ Gdnf, normalizing $E$ back toward $\\theta$ and preventing additional bud initiation.**\n- This option proposes a homeostatic compensation. However, Spry1 is itself a key component of the homeostatic machinery. Removing it while simultaneously increasing the stimulus is designed to overwhelm the system, not trigger more effective compensation. The assumption \"Assume no other pathway components are altered\" explicitly forbids invoking an unknown compensatory mechanism. This statement posits a logical contradiction to the premise of the problem.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Reduced branching and fewer ectopic buds; excess GDNF acts as a ligand sink that depleles effective RET availability, and the absence of Spry1 destabilizes receptor trafficking, leading to subthreshold ERK output $E \\lt \\theta$ at most sites and suppression of bud initiation.**\n- This option contains multiple biologically flawed assertions. More ligand ($Gdnf$) leads to more, not less, signaling. The idea of a \"ligand sink\" in this context is nonsensical. The absence of Spry1 does not \"destabilize\" receptor trafficking in a way that reduces signaling; on the contrary, by preventing RTK internalization and degradation, its absence would likely increase receptor residence time at the membrane, enhancing the signal. The predicted outcome, $E < \\theta$, is the opposite of what is expected from these perturbations.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Increased intratree branching complexity but no increase in ectopic buds; Spry1 is required for ectopic budding competence, so its loss restricts aberrant bud emergence even when Gdnf is $2\\times$, and RETâ€“ERK signaling remains spatially confined to normal cap mesenchyme contact points.**\n- This option makes a factually incorrect claim about the function of Spry1. The loss of Spry1 is a known cause of ectopic budding, not a requirement for its prevention. Therefore, the premise \"Spry1 is required for ectopic budding competence\" is false; in reality, its presence is required for proper spatial restriction of budding. The conclusion that signaling remains \"spatially confined\" is also incorrect, as both perturbations act to broaden the signaling domain.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Mildly increased branching with a modest rise in ectopic buds; the synergy arises primarily through phosphoinositide $3$-kinaseâ€“AKT amplification rather than ERK, because Spry1 does not significantly impact the RETâ€“ERK axis, so ERK amplitude and duration are unchanged and threshold crossing remains largely unaltered.**\n- This option contradicts the problem statement on a fundamental point. The problem explicitly states that Spry1 \"attenuates ERK output\". The claim that \"Spry1 does not significantly impact the RETâ€“ERK axis\" is therefore a direct violation of the given premises. While RET does signal via PI3K-AKT, the problem defines the branching mechanism exclusively in terms of the ERK output $E$ and its threshold $\\theta$. To deviate from this provided framework is not permitted. The prediction of a \"mild\" phenotype also dramatically underestimates the expected synergy.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nFinal conclusion is that Option A provides the only accurate prediction and mechanistic rationale.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2667042"}]}
