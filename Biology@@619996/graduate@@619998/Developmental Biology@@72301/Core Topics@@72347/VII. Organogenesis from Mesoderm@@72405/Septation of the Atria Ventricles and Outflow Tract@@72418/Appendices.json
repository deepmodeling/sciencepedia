It applies the principles of fluid dynamics, specifically the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, to model blood flow. This is a standard and valid approximation for laminar flow in small vessels. The biological context, referring to hemodynamic forces influencing endocardial cushion remodeling and the mechanosensitive transcription factor Klf2, is consistent with established principles in developmental biology and mechanotransduction. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information ($Q$, $r$, $\\mu$) to establish the relationship for wall shear stress and calculate the fold-change. The problem is objective and uses precise terminology. It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental relationship for wall shear stress in a fully developed laminar flow through a cylindrical conduit. For a Newtonian fluid, the shear stress $\\tau$ at a radial position $r'$ from the centerline is given by $\\tau = -\\mu \\frac{dv}{dr'}$, where $v$ is the axial fluid velocity. For Poiseuille flow, the velocity profile is parabolic:\n$$v(r') = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4 \\mu L} (R^2 - r'^2)$$\nwhere $R$ is the radius of the conduit and $\\Delta P$ is the pressure drop over length $L$. The velocity gradient is:\n$$\\frac{dv}{dr'} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2 \\mu L} r'$$\nThe wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$, is the magnitude of the shear stress at the wall, where $r' = R$:\n$$\\tau_w = \\left| -\\mu \\frac{dv}{dr'} \\right|_{r'=R} = \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\Delta P}{2 \\mu L} R \\right) = \\frac{\\Delta P R}{2L}$$\nThis expression depends on the pressure drop $\\Delta P$, which is not given directly. We must relate $\\Delta P$ to the volumetric flow rate $Q$. The Hagen-Poiseuille equation provides this relationship:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi R^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}$$\nSolving for $\\Delta P$ yields:\n$$\\Delta P = \\frac{8 \\mu L Q}{\\pi R^4}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\Delta P$ back into the equation for $\\tau_w$:\n$$\\tau_w = \\frac{R}{2L} \\left( \\frac{8 \\mu L Q}{\\pi R^4} \\right) = \\frac{4 \\mu Q}{\\pi R^3}$$\nThis is the fundamental relationship that governs the wall shear stress in terms of the given parameters. The problem asks for the fold-change in $\\tau_w$ when $Q$ and $R$ change. Let the initial state be denoted by subscript $1$ and the final state by subscript $2$.\n\nIn the initial state:\n- Flow rate: $Q_1 = Q$\n- Radius: $r_1 = r$\nThe initial wall shear stress is:\n$$\\tau_{w,1} = \\frac{4 \\mu Q_1}{\\pi r_1^3} = \\frac{4 \\mu Q}{\\pi r^3}$$\n\nIn the final state:\n- Flow rate: $Q_2 = 2Q$\n- Radius: $r_2 = 0.8r = \\frac{4}{5}r$\nThe final wall shear stress is:\n$$\\tau_{w,2} = \\frac{4 \\mu Q_2}{\\pi r_2^3} = \\frac{4 \\mu (2Q)}{\\pi (0.8r)^3}$$\n\nThe fold-change is the ratio $\\frac{\\tau_{w,2}}{\\tau_{w,1}}$:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{\\tau_{w,2}}{\\tau_{w,1}} = \\frac{\\frac{4 \\mu (2Q)}{\\pi (0.8r)^3}}{\\frac{4 \\mu Q}{\\pi r^3}}$$\nThe constant terms $\\frac{4 \\mu}{\\pi}$ cancel out, as do the variables $Q$ and $r^3$:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{ (0.8)^3 }}{\\frac{1}{1}} = \\frac{2}{(0.8)^3}$$\nWe now evaluate the denominator. The value $0.8$ is equivalent to the fraction $\\frac{4}{5}$.\n$$(0.8)^3 = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^3 = \\frac{4^3}{5^3} = \\frac{64}{125}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the fold-change:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{64}{125}} = 2 \\times \\frac{125}{64} = \\frac{250}{64}$$\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $2$:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{125}{32}$$\nThis is the fold-change in wall shear stress, expressed as an exact fraction.\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we must infer the biological response. Kruppel-like factor 2 (Klf2) is a transcription factor expressed in endothelial cells, which form the endocardium. It is a key mediator of the anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, and quiescent endothelial phenotype. The expression of the Klf2 gene is known to be strongly and positively regulated by high levels of steady, laminar shear stress. As our calculation shows, the shear stress increases by a factor of $\\frac{125}{32}$, which is approximately $3.9$. This represents a substantial increase. Given the established biological principle that Klf2 expression is upregulated by laminar shear stress, and assuming the endothelial cells' response is not saturated, it is expected that Klf2 transcription will increase under these new hemodynamic conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{125}{32}}$$", "id": "2670917"}, {"introduction": "The formation of complex three-dimensional structures, such as the conotruncal cushions that septate the cardiac outflow tract, depends on the massive and coordinated influx of cells.
