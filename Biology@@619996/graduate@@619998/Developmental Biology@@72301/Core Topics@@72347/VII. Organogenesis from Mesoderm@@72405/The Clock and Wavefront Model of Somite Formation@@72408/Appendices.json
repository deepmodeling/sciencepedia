The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities. Therefore, it is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe fundamental principle of the clock and wavefront model is that a temporal periodicity (the segmentation clock) is translated into a spatial periodicity (the somites) by a moving determination front. We will derive the relationship from first principles as instructed.\n\nLet us establish a one-dimensional coordinate system, $x$, along the anterior-posterior axis of the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). A somite boundary is formed at a specific location when a cell's internal clock, which oscillates with period $T$, reaches a certain phase threshold at the moment the determination front passes over it.\n\nLet $t_n$ be the time at which the $n$-th somite boundary is formed at position $x_n$. According to the model, the time interval between the formation of two consecutive boundaries, say boundary $n$ and boundary $n+1$, must be equal to one period of the segmentation clock.\n$$t_{n+1} - t_n = T$$\nDuring this time interval, from $t_n$ to $t_{n+1}$, the determination front moves through the PSM. The problem states that this front moves at a constant effective speed $v$ relative to the tissue. The position of the boundary $n+1$ is $x_{n+1}$. The position of the boundary $n$ is $x_n$. The size of the newly formed somite, which we denote as $S$, is the distance between these two consecutive boundaries.\n$$S = |x_{n+1} - x_n|$$\nThis distance is precisely the distance covered by the determination front during the time interval $T$. Using the basic kinematic relation for an object moving at constant speed, distance is the product of speed and time.\n$$S = v \\cdot (t_{n+1} - t_n)$$\nSubstituting the time interval with the clock period $T$, we arrive at the expression for the somite size $S$.\n$$S = vT$$\nThis derivation from first principles establishes the direct relationship between the clock period $T$, the front's speed $v$, and the resulting somite length $S$.\n\nFor the first part of the problem, we are given the values $T = 30$ min and $v = 3$ $\\mu\\text{m}\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$.

It presents a standard reaction-diffusion scenario, a cornerstone of mathematical biology for modeling morphogen gradients. All data and conditions provided are consistent and sufficient for deriving a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nWe proceed with the derivation. The problem asks us to derive the steady-state concentration profile $c(x)$ of Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) along a one-dimensional tissue axis, $x \\ge 0$. The derivation must start from three fundamental principles: (i) mass conservation, (ii) Fick’s law of diffusion, and (iii) first-order degradation kinetics.\n\nLet us consider a small, one-dimensional control volume of length $\\Delta x$ and uniform cross-sectional area $A$, located between position $x$ and $x+\\Delta x$. The total amount of FGF in this volume is $c(x,t) A \\Delta x$.\n\nThe principle of mass conservation states that the rate of change of the amount of substance in the control volume is equal to the net flux into the volume minus the rate of removal by degradation.\nThe rate of change of mass is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (c A \\Delta x)$.\nThe flux of FGF into the volume at position $x$ is $J(x,t) A$, and the flux out of the volume at position $x+\\Delta x$ is $J(x+\\Delta x, t) A$. The net flux into the volume is thus $(J(x,t) - J(x+\\Delta x,t))A$.\nThe FGF is degraded by first-order kinetics with rate constant $k$. The rate of removal from the volume is therefore $(k c) A \\Delta x$.\n\nCombining these terms, the mass balance equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (c A \\Delta x) = (J(x,t) - J(x+\\Delta x,t))A - k c A \\Delta x $$\nDividing by the volume $A \\Delta x$ and rearranging gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{J(x+\\Delta x,t) - J(x,t)}{\\Delta x} - k c $$\nTaking the limit as $\\Delta x \\to 0$, we obtain the one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation in its general form:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} - k c $$\nNext, we invoke Fick's first law of diffusion, which relates the flux $J$ to the concentration gradient:\n$$ J = -D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} $$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. Substituting Fick's law into the mass balance equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(-D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right) - k c = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} - k c $$\nThe problem specifies that the system has reached a steady state, which means the concentration no longer changes with time. Therefore, $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = 0$. This simplifies the governing equation to a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$ D \\frac{d^2 c}{d x^2} - k c = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{d^2 c}{d x^2} - \\frac{k}{D} c = 0 $$\nThis equation describes the steady-state concentration profile. To solve it, we define a parameter with the dimension of length, $\\lambda$, as $\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}}$. The ODE can now be written in a more compact form:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 c}{d x^2} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} c = 0 $$\nThis is a homogeneous linear second-order ODE with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is $r^2 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} = 0$, which has roots $r = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$. The general solution is therefore:\n$$ c(x) = C_1 \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) + C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) $$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are integration constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nThe first boundary condition is that the concentration vanishes far from the source: $c(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$. For this to hold, the term with the positive exponent, $\\exp(x/\\lambda)$, must be zero, as it grows without bound as $x \\to \\infty$. This requires that the constant $C_1$ must be $0$. The solution reduces to:\n$$ c(x) = C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) $$\nThe second boundary condition is a constant production flux, $J_0$, at the source $x=0$. The flux $J(x)$ is given by Fick's law:\n$$ J(x) = -D \\frac{dc}{dx} = -D \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) \\right) = -D \\left( -\\frac{C_2}{\\lambda} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{D C_2}{\\lambda} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) $$\nAt $x=0$, the flux is $J(0) = J_0$:\n$$ J_0 = \\frac{D C_2}{\\lambda} $$\nSolving for the constant $C_2$ gives:\n$$ C_2 = \\frac{J_0 \\lambda}{D} $$\nSubstituting this back into the solution for $c(x)$, we obtain the final steady-state concentration profile:\n$$ c(x) = \\frac{J_0 \\lambda}{D} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) $$\nFrom this derivation, the characteristic length scale governing the spatial decay of the profile is immediately identified as:\n$$ \\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}} $$\nThis length scale emerges naturally from the non-dimensionalization of the governing ODE and dictates the distance over which the concentration decays by a factor of $e^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we define the position of the wavefront, $x^{\\ast}$, as the location where the FGF concentration equals a fixed threshold $c_{\\mathrm{th}}$. We set $c(x^{\\ast}) = c_{\\mathrm{th}}$:\n$$ \\frac{J_0 \\lambda}{D} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{\\lambda}\\right) = c_{\\mathrm{th}} $$\nTo solve for $x^{\\ast}$, we first isolate the exponential term:\n$$ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{\\lambda}\\right) = \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{th}} D}{J_0 \\lambda} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{\\lambda} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_{\\mathrm{th}} D}{J_0 \\lambda}\\right) $$\n$$ x^{\\ast} = -\\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_{\\mathrm{th}} D}{J_0 \\lambda}\\right) = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{c_{\\mathrm{th}} D}{J_0 \\lambda}\\right)^{-1}\\right) $$\nThus, the position of the wavefront is:\n$$ x^{\\ast} = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{J_0 \\lambda}{c_{\\mathrm{th}} D}\\right) $$\nThe term $\\frac{J_0 \\lambda}{D}$ is the concentration at the source, $c(0)$, which we can denote as $c_0$. The expression for $x^{\\ast}$ can be written more transparently as $x^{\\ast} = \\lambda \\ln(c_0 / c_{\\mathrm{th}})$, which explicitly shows its dependence on the characteristic length scale $\\lambda$ and the ratio of the source concentration to the threshold concentration.\n\nFinally, we provide the biological interpretation. The characteristic length scale, $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$, is a fundamental parameter of the morphogen gradient. It represents the distance over which an FGF molecule, produced at the tailbud, typically diffuses before it is degraded. A larger $\\lambda$ (due to high diffusion $D$ or low degradation $k$) results in a shallow gradient that extends far into the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). A smaller $\\lambda$ (due to low diffusion $D$ or high degradation $k$) results in a steep, localized gradient. In the context of the clock and wavefront model, the wavefront of somitogenesis is posited to be the location where the FGF concentration falls below a critical threshold, $c_{\\mathrm{th}}$. Our derived expression, $x^{\\ast} = \\lambda \\ln(c_0/c_{\\mathrm{th}})$, demonstrates that the position of this wavefront is directly proportional to the characteristic length scale $\\lambda$. Therefore, $\\lambda$ is not merely an abstract mathematical parameter; it is a physical property of the tissue system that directly constrains positional information. Any genetic or environmental factor that alters the diffusion or degradation rates of FGF will change $\\lambda$ and consequently shift the position of the wavefront, thereby affecting the size and location of the formed somites.\n\nThe problem specifically asks for the closed-form analytical expression for the characteristic length scale.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}}} $$", "id": "2679229"}, {"introduction": "The other key component of the model is the segmentation 'clock,' a self-sustaining molecular oscillator within each cell.
