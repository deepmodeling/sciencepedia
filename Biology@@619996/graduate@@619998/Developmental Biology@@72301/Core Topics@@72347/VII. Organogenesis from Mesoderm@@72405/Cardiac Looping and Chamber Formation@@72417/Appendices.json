Consider the heart tube as a homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic rod of length $L$, Young’s modulus $E$, second moment of area $I$, and cross-sectional area $A$. The rod has bending stiffness $B$ defined by $B = E I$. End attachments and surrounding constraints are represented by an effective end-constraint factor $K$ that rescales the buckling half-wavelength via an effective length $K L$, with smaller $K$ indicating stiffer constraint.

It poses a standard question in mechanical stability theory applied to a biomechanical context, using established principles of continuum mechanics. All necessary information is provided, and the task is to perform a direct derivation. I shall therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the critical compressive strain, $\\epsilon_{cr}$, that induces buckling in an elastic rod model of the embryonic heart tube. We are given the starting point as two fundamental equations from mechanics.\n\nFirst is the classical Euler critical load formula for a slender elastic rod with effective length $K L$:\n$$P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^{2} B}{(K L)^{2}}$$\nHere, $P_{cr}$ is the critical axial compressive load, $B$ is the bending stiffness of the rod, $L$ is its length, and $K$ is a dimensionless factor accounting for the end-support conditions.\n\nSecond is the constitutive relation for a linearly elastic material under uniaxial load, which is Hooke's Law:\n$$\\sigma = E \\epsilon$$\nThis equation relates the uniaxial stress $\\sigma$ to the uniaxial strain $\\epsilon$ via the Young's modulus $E$.\n\nTo connect these two concepts, we must introduce a third standard mechanical relation: the definition of uniaxial stress. Stress $\\sigma$ is defined as the force $P$ acting perpendicularly to a surface, divided by the area $A$ over which the force is distributed:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{P}{A}$$\n\nThe problem states that buckling occurs when a growth-induced compressive strain reaches a critical value, $\\epsilon_{cr}$. At this point of incipient buckling, the internal stress in the rod will be the critical stress, $\\sigma_{cr}$, and the corresponding axial load will be the critical load, $P_{cr}$.\n\nWe can therefore write the relationships at the critical point:\n1. The critical load is related to the critical stress by $P_{cr} = \\sigma_{cr} A$.\n2. The critical stress is related to the critical strain by $\\sigma_{cr} = E \\epsilon_{cr}$, assuming the material remains within its linear elastic regime.\n\nOur goal is to find an expression for $\\epsilon_{cr}$. We can begin by substituting the expression for $P_{cr}$ from the stress definition into the Euler buckling formula.\n$$\\sigma_{cr} A = \\frac{\\pi^{2} B}{(K L)^{2}}$$\n\nNext, we substitute the expression for the critical stress, $\\sigma_{cr} = E \\epsilon_{cr}$, into this equation:\n$$(E \\epsilon_{cr}) A = \\frac{\\pi^{2} B}{(K L)^{2}}$$\n\nWe can now solve for the critical strain, $\\epsilon_{cr}$:\n$$\\epsilon_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^{2} B}{E A (K L)^{2}}$$\n\nThe problem requires that the final expression be given in terms of $K$, $L$, $I$, and $A$, eliminating $B$ and $E$. We are provided with the definition of bending stiffness:\n$$B = E I$$\nwhere $I$ is the second moment of area of the rod's cross-section.\n\nSubstituting this definition of $B$ into our expression for $\\epsilon_{cr}$ yields:\n$$\\epsilon_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^{2} (E I)}{E A (K L)^{2}}$$\n\nObserve that the Young's modulus, $E$, appears in both the numerator and the denominator. Thus, it cancels out, leaving:\n$$\\epsilon_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^{2} I}{A (K L)^{2}}$$\n\nThis expression provides the critical strain solely in terms of the required geometric parameters ($I$, $A$, $L$) and the constraint factor ($K$). It is a fundamental result that the critical strain for Euler buckling of a slender rod is independent of the material's stiffness ($E$) and depends only on the geometry of the rod and its boundary conditions.

It represents a standard, formalizable problem in applied probability theory. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid, and we proceed to a first-principles solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to compute the probabilities of a continuous random variable $X$ falling into one of three disjoint intervals on the real number line.
