Well-tested observations include: Wingless/Integrated (Wnt) signals from the dorsal neural tube and ectoderm promote myogenic determination gene expression in the dermomyotome; Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) from the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) antagonizes myogenic determination and biases cells toward lateral plate–type mesenchyme and smooth muscle fates; Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) from the notochord and floor plate promotes sclerotome.

Somite patterning depends on positional information from opposing signal gradients.\n2.  Wingless/Integrated (Wnt) from the dorsal neural tube and ectoderm promotes myogenic determination gene expression in the dermomyotome.\n3.  Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) from the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) antagonizes myogenic determination and biases cells toward lateral plate–type mesenchyme and smooth muscle fates.\n4.  Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) from the notochord and floor plate promotes sclerotome.\n5.  There is a monotonic lateral-to-medial BMP gradient. This implies BMP concentration is highest laterally (near the LPM source) and decreases medially.\n6.  There is a monotonic dorsal-to-ventral Wnt gradient. This implies Wnt concentration is highest dorsally (near the dorsal neural tube/ectoderm source) and decreases ventrally.\n7.  A cell enters the myogenic fate if and only if two conditions are met simultaneously: Wnt concentration is above a certain threshold, and BMP concentration is below a certain threshold.\n8.  Experimental condition 1: Wnt levels are held constant.\n9.  Experimental condition 2: BMP ligand production from the LPM is ectopically increased uniformly by a factor of $2$. Source geometry is unaltered.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the required criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The premises are fundamental principles of developmental biology regarding somite patterning. The roles of Wnt (pro-myogenic), BMP (anti-myogenic, pro-lateral mesoderm), and Shh (pro-sclerotome) are well-established. The use of morphogen gradients and threshold models to explain cell fate decisions is a central paradigm in the field. All statements are factually sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem presents a clearly defined system (somite patterning model), a specific perturbation (2-fold increase in BMP), and a precise question (predict the change in cell fates). The provided information, including the simplification that Wnt levels are constant, is sufficient to deduce a unique qualitative outcome.\n- **Objective**: The language is technical and free of subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem statement has no scientific or logical flaws. It is self-contained, consistent, and represents a standard conceptual problem in developmental biology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nLet us formalize the model described. We can define a simplified two-dimensional coordinate system for a somite cross-section. Let the medial-to-lateral axis be represented by a coordinate $x$, where $x$ increases laterally. Let the dorsal-to-ventral axis be represented by a coordinate $y$, where $y$ increases ventrally.\n\nThe concentrations of the morphogens are functions of position.\n-   The BMP gradient is lateral-to-medial, meaning BMP concentration, $B(x)$, is a monotonically increasing function of the lateral coordinate $x$. The source is the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM).\n-   The Wnt gradient is dorsal-to-ventral, meaning Wnt concentration, $W(y)$, is a monotonically decreasing function of the ventral coordinate $y$. The source is dorsal.\n\nAccording to the given rules, a cell at position $(x, y)$ will commit to a myogenic fate if and only if:\n$$W(y) > W_{threshold} \\quad \\text{AND} \\quad B(x) < B_{threshold}$$\nwhere $W_{threshold}$ and $B_{threshold}$ are fixed critical values.\n\nThe experiment introduces two changes:\n1.  Wnt levels are held constant. This means the condition $W(y) > W_{threshold}$ is unaltered. The spatial domain of cells competent to respond to myogenic signals does not change.\n2.  BMP production is increased by a factor of $2$. The new BMP concentration at any point $x$ is $B_{new}(x) = 2 \\cdot B_{old}(x)$.\n\nThe condition for myogenesis under the new experimental circumstances becomes:\n$$W(y) > W_{threshold} \\quad \\text{AND} \\quad B_{new}(x) < B_{threshold}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $B_{new}(x)$, the second condition is:\n$$2 \\cdot B_{old}(x) < B_{threshold}$$\n$$B_{old}(x) < \\frac{B_{threshold}}{2}$$\n\nLet us analyze the spatial consequence of this change.\nIn the original state, the lateral boundary of the myogenic domain was defined by the position $x_{old}$ where $B_{old}(x_{old}) = B_{threshold}$. All cells more medial than this (i.e., with $x < x_{old}$) were in a BMP-permissive environment.\nIn the new state, the lateral boundary is at a new position $x_{new}$ where the concentration equals the same threshold, but with the new gradient: $B_{new}(x_{new}) = B_{threshold}$. This means $2 \\cdot B_{old}(x_{new}) = B_{threshold}$, or $B_{old}(x_{new}) = B_{threshold}/2$.\n\nSince $B_{old}(x)$ is a monotonically increasing function of lateral position $x$, and $B_{threshold}/2 < B_{threshold}$, it logically follows that the position $x_{new}$ must be more medial than the original position $x_{old}$. That is, $x_{new} < x_{old}$.\n\nThis proves that the region permissive for myogenesis has shrunk. The lateral boundary of this region has shifted medially.\n\nNow, we relate this to the anatomical subdivisions of the myotome.\n-   The **epaxial myotome** develops from the dorsomedial part of the somite (low $x$, low $y$). This region is subject to the lowest levels of BMP.\n-   The **hypaxial myotome** (forming limb and body wall muscles) develops from the dorsolateral part of the somite (higher $x$, low $y$).\n\nThe loss of myogenic territory occurs at the lateral edge of the myotome-forming region. This corresponds precisely to the domain of the prospective hypaxial myotome. Cells in the most medial domain (prospective epaxial myotome) are exposed to the lowest BMP levels, and thus are most likely to remain below the effective threshold ($B_{threshold}/2$), meaning this region is \"relatively spared\".\n\nThe cells in the lateral somite that now experience a BMP level too high for myogenesis ($B_{new}(x) > B_{threshold}$) will, according to the problem statement, adopt the alternative fate promoted by high BMP: \"lateral plate–type mesenchyme and smooth muscle fates\". Therefore, this territory will expand medially, occupying the space that would have become hypaxial myotome. The genes marking myogenesis, such as Myogenic Factor 5 ($Myf5$) and Myogenic Differentiation ($MyoD$), will be expressed in a smaller, more medial domain. Genes associated with lateral mesoderm, such as $Msh$ homeobox $1$/$2$ ($Msx1/2$), Heart and Neural Crest Derivatives Expressed $2$ ($Hand2$), and Forkhead Box F$1$ ($Foxf1$), will be expressed in an expanded lateral domain.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Global expansion of myotome, with increased Myf5 and MyoD expression throughout both epaxial and hypaxial domains due to synergistic BMP–Wnt interactions, and a concomitant reduction of lateral plate–derived smooth muscle and mesenchyme.**\n**Incorrect.** This option states the opposite of the derived outcome. Increasing BMP, which is an antagonist of myogenesis, must lead to a reduction, not an expansion, of the myotome. The problem defines the BMP-Wnt relationship for myogenesis as antagonistic, not synergistic.\n\n**B. Medial restriction and net reduction of myotome, with preferential loss or delay of hypaxial (dorsolateral) myogenesis, reduced Myf5/MyoD and expansion of lateral plate–like mesenchyme (for example, increased Msx1/2, Hand2, Foxf1) in lateral somite, while the epaxial (dorsomedial) myotome near the dorsal neural tube is relatively spared.**\n**Correct.** This option precisely matches every aspect of our derivation. It correctly predicts a net reduction of the myotome, a medial shift of its boundary, a preferential effect on the lateral (hypaxial) domain, the consequent expansion of lateral mesoderm fates, and the relative sparing of the medial (epaxial) domain. The listed molecular markers are appropriate for the described fates.\n\n**C. No significant change in myotome size or composition because Wnt sufficiency alone determines myogenesis; only altering Sonic Hedgehog would affect somite fate.**\n**Incorrect.** This contradicts a central premise of the problem: \"myogenic entry requires Wnt above a threshold and BMP below a threshold\". Myogenesis is dependent on both signals. The fact that Wnt is held constant does not negate the crucial role of BMP.\n\n**D. Ventralization of somites into sclerotome, with expansion of cartilage precursors and Pax1 expression across the lateral somite, because BMP functionally substitutes for Sonic Hedgehog in promoting sclerotome.**\n**Incorrect.** The problem explicitly states that BMP biases cells toward \"lateral plate–type mesenchyme and smooth muscle fates\", not sclerotome. It also states that Shh promotes sclerotome. There is no information given to support the claim that BMP can substitute for Shh in this context. This introduces a functional role for BMP that is not provided in the problem statement and is biologically inaccurate for this specific patterning event.\n\n**E. Selective increase of hypaxial myogenesis, with more robust limb and body wall muscle formation due to BMP promotion of dermomyotome delamination and migration, and little to no change in epaxial myogenesis.**\n**Incorrect.** This is factually inverted. It claims an increase in hypaxial myogenesis, which is the domain most sensitive to the increased BMP antagonism. Furthermore, it posits a promotional role for BMP in myogenesis (\"promotion of dermomyotome delamination\"), directly contradicting the explicit statement that BMP \"antagonizes myogenic determination\".", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2656907"}, {"introduction": "Once a cell is fated to become muscle, specific gene networks are activated.

It presents a standard problem in biochemical kinetics using the Hill model for cooperative binding, a widely accepted framework for describing such phenomena in developmental biology and other fields. All data and conditions are provided, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. We will therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires us to model the concerted binding of $n$ molecules of the transcription factor MyoD, denoted as $M$, to a single promoter site, the E-box, denoted as $P$. This process can be represented by the chemical equilibrium:\n$$ n M + P \\rightleftharpoons M_n P $$\nwhere $M_n P$ is the complex of the promoter bound by $n$ MyoD molecules.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the effective dissociation constant for this concerted reaction, which we shall denote $K_{D,eff}$, is given by:\n$$ K_{D,eff} = \\frac{[M]^n [P]}{[M_n P]} $$\nHere, $[M]$ is the concentration of free MyoD, $[P]$ is the concentration of the free promoter, and $[M_n P]$ is the concentration of the occupied promoter.\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the fraction of total promoter sites that are bound by MyoD.

That is, when $[M] = K_d$, $\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$. We use this definition to relate $K_{D,eff}$ to the provided parameter $K_d$. Substituting these values into the derived Hill equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{K_d^n}{K_{D,eff} + K_d^n} $$\nSolving for $K_{D,eff}$:\n$$ K_{D,eff} + K_d^n = 2 K_d^n $$\n$$ K_{D,eff} = K_d^n $$\nNow we substitute this result back into our general Hill equation to obtain the expression in terms of the given parameters $[M]$, $n$, and $K_d$:\n$$ \\theta([M]) = \\frac{[M]^n}{K_d^n + [M]^n} $$\nThe problem states that the reporter output, which we can call $R$, is proportional to the promoter occupancy $\\theta$, and basal activity is negligible.
