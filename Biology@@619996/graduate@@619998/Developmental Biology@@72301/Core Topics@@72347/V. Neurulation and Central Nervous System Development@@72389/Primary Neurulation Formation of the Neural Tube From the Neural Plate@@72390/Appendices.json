It presents a simplified biophysical model of epithelial bending, a core process in primary neurulation, based on established principles of volume conservation and differential geometry. The given parameters are sufficient and consistent for a unique solution. Therefore, we proceed to the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires a determination of the tissue midline curvature $\\kappa$ based on the geometry of its constituent cells after a shape change. The solution is founded on two physical principles: the conservation of cell volume during deformation and the geometric compatibility condition for a bent epithelial sheet.\n\nFirst, we model an individual neuroepithelial cell as a prism of constant anteroposterior depth $\\ell$. Its cross-section in the mediolateral plane is a trapezoid with apicobasal height $h$, apical width $w_a$, and basal width $w_b$. The volume of this prism, $V$, is given by the product of its cross-sectional area and its depth:\n$$ V = \\left( \\frac{w_a + w_b}{2} \\right) h \\ell $$\nThe problem states that cell volume is conserved. We are given the values for $V$, $h$, $\\ell$, and the constricted apical width $w_a$. We must first determine the resulting basal width $w_b$. By rearranging the volume conservation equation, we solve for $w_b$:\n$$ \\frac{2V}{h\\ell} = w_a + w_b $$\n$$ w_b = \\frac{2V}{h\\ell} - w_a $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values: $V = 2000\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^{3}$, $h = 40\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $\\ell = 10\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$, and $w_a = 4\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$ w_b = \\frac{2(2000)}{40 \\cdot 10} - 4 = \\frac{4000}{400} - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} $$\nThus, the basal width of the cell is $w_b = 6\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nSecond, we must relate the cell shape to the curvature of the epithelial sheet. The problem states that the strip bends into a circular arc of constant thickness $h$. The curvature, $\\kappa$, is defined as the reciprocal of the radius of curvature. We define the radius of curvature $R$ at the midline of the sheet, so $\\kappa = \\frac{1}{R}$.\nThe apical surface of the sheet follows a circular arc of radius $R_a = R - \\frac{h}{2}$.\nThe basal surface of the sheet follows a concentric circular arc of radius $R_b = R + \\frac{h}{2}$.\n\nNow, consider a small segment of the bent tissue that subtends an infinitesimal angle $d\\theta$ at the center of curvature. The arc length of the apical edge of this segment is $ds_a = R_a d\\theta$, and the arc length of the basal edge is $ds_b = R_b d\\theta$. The problem's idealization implies that the local mediolateral cell widths, $w_a$ and $w_b$, are geometrically proportional to these arc lengths. We can therefore write:\n$$ w_a = \\left(R - \\frac{h}{2}\\right) d\\theta' $$\n$$ w_b = \\left(R + \\frac{h}{2}\\right) d\\theta' $$\nHere, $d\\theta'$ represents the small angle subtended by a single cell.
