We can solve it to find the length $L$ as a function of time $t$. We integrate from the initial condition at $t=0$, where the length is $L(0) = L_{0}$, to a general time $t$.\n$$\\int_{L_{0}}^{L(t)} dL' = \\int_{0}^{t} (-2v) dt'$$\nSince $v$ is stated to be constant, the integration is straightforward.\n$$[L']_{L_{0}}^{L(t)} = [-2vt']_{0}^{t}$$\n$$L(t) - L_{0} = -2vt - 0$$\nThis gives the expression for the open length at any time $t$ before closure is complete:\n$$L(t) = L_{0} - 2vt$$\nClosure is complete at time $t = t_{\\mathrm{close}}$ when the open length becomes zero, i.e., $L(t_{\\mathrm{close}}) = 0$. Substituting this condition into our equation:\n$$0 = L_{0} - 2vt_{\\mathrm{close}}$$\nSolving for $t_{\\mathrm{close}}$, we obtain the general expression for the time to closure:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{close}} = \\frac{L_{0}}{2v}$$\nThis expression is physically intuitive: the time to close a gap is the initial size of the gap, $L_{0}$, divided by the speed at which the gap is being closed, $2v$.\n\nNext, we must compute the numerical value for $t_{\\mathrm{close}}$. The given parameters are $L_{0} = 1.5 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ and $v = 20 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} \\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$. To perform the calculation, the units must be consistent. We will convert millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}$) to micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}$).\nWe know that $1 \\ \\mathrm{mm} = 10^{3} \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$L_{0} = 1.5 \\ \\mathrm{mm} \\times \\frac{10^{3} \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}}{1 \\ \\mathrm{mm}} = 1500 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nThe speed of each front is $v = 20 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} \\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$. The total speed of closure is $2v$.\n$$2v = 2 \\times 20 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} \\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1} = 40 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} \\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$$\nNow, we substitute these values into our derived expression for $t_{\\mathrm{close}}$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{close}} = \\frac{1500 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}}{40 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} \\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}}$$\nThe units of $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ cancel, leaving the result in minutes, as required.\n$$t_{\\mathrm{close}} = \\frac{1500}{40} \\ \\mathrm{min} = \\frac{150}{4} \\ \\mathrm{min} = \\frac{75}{2} \\ \\mathrm{min}$$\nEvaluating the fraction gives the final numerical answer.\n$$t_{\\mathrm{close}} = 37.5 \\ \\mathrm{min}$$\nThis result is an exact value based on the provided data, so no rounding is necessary.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{37.5}$$", "id": "2657782"}]}
