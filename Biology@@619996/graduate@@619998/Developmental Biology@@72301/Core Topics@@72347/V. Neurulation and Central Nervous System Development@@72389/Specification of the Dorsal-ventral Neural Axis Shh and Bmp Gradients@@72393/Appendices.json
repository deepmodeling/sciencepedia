This calculation is a cornerstone for quantitatively understanding how morphogens sculpt developing tissues.[@problem_id:2674824]", "problem": "In the vertebrate neural tube, Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) secreted from the ventral midline (notochord and floor plate) forms a morphogen gradient along the dorsal-ventral axis that patterns progenitor domains. Consider a simplified, one-dimensional tissue extending from the ventral source at position $x=0$ toward dorsal increasing $x$. Assume that at steady state the morphogen concentration profile is given by the empirically well-supported exponential form $c(x)=c_{0}\\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, where $c_{0}$ is the morphogen concentration at $x=0$ and $\\lambda$ is the characteristic length scale set by diffusion and degradation. A progenitor domain boundary is defined by the position $x^{\\ast}$ at which the local morphogen concentration equals a gene regulatory threshold $T$ for fate activation. Assume $c_{0}>T$ so that a finite boundary exists at $x^{\\ast}>0$.\n\nUsing only the following foundational bases:\n- Reaction-diffusion steady states with uniform linear degradation in one dimension produce exponential decays away from a boundary source under steady conditions.\n- Threshold models of gene regulatory network activation define domain boundaries where the morphogen concentration equals a fixed threshold.\n\nDerive from first principles the explicit closed-form expression for $x^{\\ast}$ in terms of $\\lambda$ and the ratio $c_{0}/T$.

If you choose to state any intermediate numerical relationships, express any integers such as $2$ in standard mathematical notation. The final answer must be a single closed-form expression.", "solution": "The problem as stated is coherent, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. It presents a canonical model of morphogen gradient formation and interpretation from developmental biology, which is amenable to straightforward mathematical analysis. We will proceed with the derivation from the provided first principles.\n\nThe foundational bases are:\n$1$. The steady-state concentration profile of the morphogen in a one-dimensional tissue with a source at $x=0$ and uniform linear degradation is given by an exponential decay.\n$2$. The boundary of a progenitor domain is established at a specific spatial position where the morphogen concentration equals a fixed activation threshold.\n\nThe problem provides the explicit mathematical form for the concentration profile, $c(x)$, as a function of position, $x$:\n$$c(x) = c_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nHere, $c_{0}$ is the concentration at the source ($x=0$) and $\\lambda$ is the characteristic length scale of the gradient. This equation is the direct mathematical consequence of the first foundational basis.\n\nThe problem defines the position of the progenitor domain boundary, denoted as $x^{\\ast}$, by the condition that the local concentration at this position is precisely equal to the gene regulatory threshold, $T$. This corresponds to the second foundational basis. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$c(x^{\\ast}) = T$$\n\nTo find the explicit expression for $x^{\\ast}$, we substitute the expression for $c(x)$ into the boundary condition equation:\n$$c_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{\\lambda}\\right) = T$$\n\nOur objective is to solve this equation for $x^{\\ast}$. The problem states the prerequisite that $c_{0} > T$, which is a necessary condition for a boundary to form at a finite, positive position $x^{\\ast} > 0$. We begin the algebraic manipulation by isolating the exponential term. We divide both sides of the equation by $c_{0}$:\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{\\lambda}\\right) = \\frac{T}{c_{0}}$$\n\nTo solve for the argument of the exponential function, we apply the natural logarithm, $\\ln$, to both sides of the equation:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{\\lambda}\\right)\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{T}{c_{0}}\\right)$$\n\nThe natural logarithm is the inverse function of the exponential function, so they cancel on the left-hand side, yielding:\n$$-\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{\\lambda} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{T}{c_{0}}\\right)$$\n\nWe can use the property of logarithms, $\\ln(a/b) = -\\ln(b/a)$, to rewrite the right-hand side, which is often more intuitive as it involves a ratio greater than $1$:\n$$-\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{\\lambda} = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{c_{0}}{T}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we multiply both sides by $-\\lambda$ to isolate $x^{\\ast}$:\n$$x^{\\ast} = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_{0}}{T}\\right)$$\n\nThis is the explicit closed-form expression for the boundary position $x^{\\ast}$. The condition $c_{0} > T$ ensures that the ratio $c_{0}/T > 1$, and therefore its natural logarithm is a positive number, $\\ln(c_{0}/T) > 0$. Since $\\lambda$ is a physical length scale, it is also positive, $\\lambda > 0$. Consequently, the position $x^{\\ast}$ is guaranteed to be positive, which is physically consistent with the problem setup.\n\nThe next task is to analyze the functional dependence, or scaling, of $x^{\\ast}$ with respect to $\\lambda$ and the ratio $c_{0}/T$.\n\n$1$. Scaling with $\\lambda$: The expression shows that $x^{\\ast}$ is directly proportional to $\\lambda$. This is a linear relationship. If the characteristic length $\\lambda$ is doubled, while the concentrations $c_{0}$ and $T$ remain constant, the boundary position $x^{\\ast}$ also doubles. This means the overall pattern scales linearly with the length scale of the morphogen gradient.\n\n$2$. Scaling with $c_{0}/T$: The expression shows that $x^{\\ast}$ depends on the logarithm of the ratio $c_{0}/T$. This is a non-linear, logarithmic relationship. A logarithmic dependence implies that the position of the boundary is relatively insensitive, or robust, to fluctuations in the magnitude of the gradient. For example, doubling the source concentration from $c_{0}$ to $2c_{0}$ (and thus doubling the ratio $c_{0}/T$) does not double the boundary position $x^{\\ast}$. Instead, the position shifts by an additive amount:\n$$x_{\\text{new}}^{\\ast} = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{2 c_{0}}{T}\\right) = \\lambda \\left(\\ln(2) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_{0}}{T}\\right)\\right) = x^{\\ast} + \\lambda \\ln(2)$$\nThis demonstrates that large relative changes in concentration lead to smaller absolute changes in position, a critical feature for ensuring robust developmental patterning.\n\nThe final derived expression, satisfying all conditions and derived from first principles, combines these dependencies.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_{0}}{T}\\right)}$$", "id": "2674824"}, {"introduction": "While a single gradient can establish a single boundary, most biological patterns are more intricate and arise from the interplay of multiple signals.

Since $\\delta_P = 1.2 \\neq 0$, we must have $P^*=0$.\nSubstituting $P^*=0$ into the second equation, and noting that $A_P(0)=0$:\n$0 = \\frac{\\alpha_O}{2} (0) R_N(N^*) - \\delta_O O^* = -\\delta_O O^*$. Since $\\delta_O = 1.0 \\neq 0$, it follows that $O^*=0$.\nFinally, substituting $P^*=0$ and $O^*=0$ into the third equation, and noting that $R_P(0)=1$ and $R_O(0)=1$:\n$0 = \\frac{\\alpha_N}{2} (1) (1) - \\delta_N N^*$, which gives $N^* = \\frac{\\alpha_N}{2\\delta_N}$.\nUsing the provided parameter values $\\alpha_N=3.2$ and $\\delta_N=0.8$:\n$$\nN^* = \\frac{3.2}{2 \\times 0.8} = \\frac{3.2}{1.6} = 2\n$$\nThus, the fixed point corresponding to the p3-like progenitor fate under these conditions is $(P^*, O^*, N^*) = (0, 0, 2)$. This verifies the existence and location of the specified fixed point.\n\n**Task 3: Evaluation of the Jacobian and Eigenvalues**\nWe now evaluate the Jacobian matrix at the fixed point $(0, 0, 2)$ with $B=0$ and $S=1$.\n$$\nJ_{11} = -\\delta_P = -1.2\n$$\n$$\nJ_{12} = 0\n$$\n$$\nJ_{13} = \\alpha_P A_B(0) R_S(1) \\frac{-2(2)}{(1+2^2)^2} = \\alpha_P (0) (\\dots) = 0\n$$\n$$\nJ_{21} = \\alpha_O A_S(1) R_N(2) \\frac{2(0)}{(1+0^2)^2} = 0\n$$\n$$\nJ_{22} = -\\delta_O = -1.0\n$$\n$$\nJ_{23} = \\alpha_O A_S(1) A_P(0) \\frac{-2(2)}{(1+2^2)^2} = \\alpha_O \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) (0) (\\dots) = 0\n$$\n$$\nJ_{31} = \\alpha_N A_S(1) R_O(0) R_B(0) \\frac{-2(0)}{(1+0^2)^2} = 0\n$$\n$$\nJ_{32} = \\alpha_N A_S(1) R_P(0) R_B(0) \\frac{-2(0)}{(1+0^2)^2} = 0\n$$\n$$\nJ_{33} = -\\delta_N = -0.8\n$$\nThe evaluated Jacobian matrix $J^*$ is diagonal:\n$$\nJ^* = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-1.2  0  0 \\\\\n0  -1.0  0 \\\\\n0  0  -0.8\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are its diagonal entries. Therefore, the eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -1.2$, $\\lambda_2 = -1.0$, and $\\lambda_3 = -0.8$.\nThe problem asks for the spectral abscissa, which is the largest real part among the eigenvalues. All eigenvalues are real.\n$$\n\\max(\\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda_i)) = \\max(-1.2, -1.0, -0.8) = -0.8\n$$\nThis value indicates that the fixed point is stable, as all eigenvalues have negative real parts.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.8}$$", "id": "2674783"}]}
