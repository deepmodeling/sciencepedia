You will deconstruct $E_{r4}$ into four motif classes and, from first principles of cis-regulatory logic, predict the spatial effects of mutating each motif class individually.\n\nFoundational facts and definitions:\n- Transcriptional enhancers integrate activating and repressive transcription factor inputs; activation requires productive occupancy that recruits coactivators and RNA polymerase II, whereas repression can act by competitive occupancy, quenching, or corepressor recruitment that blocks activation.\n- Retinoic acid (RA) is a posteriorizing morphogen in the vertebrate hindbrain.

The provided facts about gene expression patterns, regulatory logic, and molecular interactions are consistent with the established literature on hindbrain development. The problem is a well-posed exercise in deductive reasoning based on a defined set of rules.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe spatial expression pattern of the $E_{r4}$-*lacZ* reporter is determined by the combinatorial logic of transcription factor inputs in each rhombomere. Activation of the enhancer requires the simultaneous binding of activators to both Class A (RARE) and Class B (*Hox*-Pbx/MEIS) motifs. This can be thought of as a logical AND gate. Repression via Class C (*Egr2*) or Class D (*MafB*) motifs is dominant, meaning if a repressor is present and its binding site is intact, the enhancer will be off, regardless of activator presence.\n\nLet's establish the state of activators and repressors in the relevant rhombomeres ($r3$ to $r6$) for the wild-type enhancer:\n\n-   **In $r3$**: RA signal is present (activates via Class A). *Hoxa1* is present (activates via Class B). *Egr2* is present (represses via Class C). **Result**: Repression by *Egr2* dominates. Output is OFF.\n-   **In $r4$**: RA signal is present (activates via Class A). *Hoxb1* is present (activates via Class B). No repressors are present. **Result**: Both activator classes are engaged, and there is no repression. Output is ON.\n-   **In $r5$**: RA signal is present (activates via Class A). *Hoxa1* is present (activates via Class B). Both *Egr2* (Class C) and *MafB* (Class D) are present. **Result**: Redundant repression by *Egr2* and *MafB*. Output is OFF.\n-   **In $r6$**: RA signal is present (activates via Class A). *Hoxa1* is present (activates via Class B). *MafB* is present (represses via Class D). **Result**: Repression by *MafB* dominates. Output is OFF.\n\nThis logic correctly recapitulates the wild-type expression pattern confined to $r4$. Now we analyze the effects of each mutation.\n\n**Mutate Class A (RARE):**\nThe Class A motif is stated to be \"required for RA-dependent activation.\" Its ablation prevents the binding of the RAR/RXR activator complex. As activation requires inputs from both Class A and Class B motifs, losing the Class A input will prevent activation in all rhombomeres, including $r4$.\n**Prediction**: No detectable reporter expression in the hindbrain.\n\n**Mutate Class B (*Hox*-Pbx/MEIS):**\nThe Class B motif is \"required for high-potency cooperative activation\" by *Hox*-PBX-MEIS complexes. Ablating this site prevents the binding of the activating complexes containing *Hoxa1* or *Hoxb1*. Similar to the Class A mutation, the loss of this required activating input breaks the AND gate logic. Activation cannot occur.\n**Prediction**: No detectable reporter expression in the hindbrain.\n\n**Mutate Class C (*Egr2* sites):**\nAblating the Class C sites removes the binding sites for the *Egr2* repressor. We must assess the consequences in rhombomeres where *Egr2* is expressed: $r3$ and $r5$.\n-   **In $r3$**: Activators (RA and *Hoxa1*) are present. The sole source of repression is *Egr2*. Removing its binding sites lifts this repression, allowing the activators to function. **Prediction**: Ectopic reporter expression will appear in $r3$.\n-   **In $r5$**: Activators (RA and *Hoxa1*) are present. Repression is mediated redundantly by *Egr2* (via Class C) and *MafB* (via Class D). Mutating Class C sites removes *Egr2*-mediated repression, but *MafB* and its intact Class D site remain. The problem states that \"either one alone is sufficient to silence $E_{r4}$ output.\" Therefore, *MafB* will continue to repress the enhancer. **Prediction**: Expression remains OFF in $r5$.\n-   **Overall prediction for Mutate C**: Ectopic expression appears in $r3$ only, not in $r5$.\n\n**Mutate Class D (*MafB* site):**\nAblating the Class D site removes the binding site for the *MafB* repressor. We assess the consequences in rhombomeres where *MafB* is expressed: $r5$ and $r6$.\n-   **In $r5$**: As analyzed above, repression is redundant. Removing the *MafB* input (Class D) leaves the *Egr2* repressor and its Class C sites intact. *Egr2* is sufficient to maintain repression. **Prediction**: Expression remains OFF in $r5$.\n-   **In $r6$**: Activators (RA and *Hoxa1*) are present. The sole source of repression is *MafB*. Removing its binding site lifts this repression, allowing the activators to function. **Prediction**: Ectopic reporter expression will appear in $r6$.\n-   **Overall prediction for Mutate D**: Ectopic expression appears in $r6$ only, not in $r5$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n-   **A.**\n    -   Mutate Class A: \"no detectable reporter expression in the hindbrain.\" - **Correct**.\n    -   Mutate Class B: \"no detectable reporter expression in the hindbrain.\" - **Correct**.\n    -   Mutate Class C: \"ectopic expression appears in r$3$ only, not in r$5$.\" - **Correct**.\n    -   Mutate Class D: \"ectopic expression appears in r$6$ only, not in r$5$.\" - **Correct**.\n    All four predictions in this option are consistent with our derivation.\n\n-   **B.**\n    -   Mutate Class A: \"reduced but still r$4$-restricted expression.\" - **Incorrect**.

The focus of the study is on the pathfinding of axons from Facial Branchiomotor (FBM) neurons, which originate in rhombomere 4 ($r4$).\n\nThe initial trajectory of an FBM axon as it exits $r4$ is modeled as the vector sum of three distinct guidance cues. The analysis is performed in a 2D coordinate system where the anterior direction corresponds to the positive x-axis and the lateral direction (out of the neural tube) corresponds to the positive y-axis.\n\nThe three cues are defined as follows:\n1.  **Anterior Cue ($V_A$):** An attractive cue originating from a specialized population of boundary cells at the interface between rhombomere 3 and rhombomere 4 (the r3/r4 boundary).
