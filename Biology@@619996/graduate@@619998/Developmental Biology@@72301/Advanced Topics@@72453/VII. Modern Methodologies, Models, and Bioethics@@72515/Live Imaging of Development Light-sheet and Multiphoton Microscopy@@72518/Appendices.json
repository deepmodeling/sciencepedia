All parameters are physically realistic for imaging a developing *C. elegans* embryo. The fundamental principles provided are correct representations of these concepts.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a complete set of constraints and data required to determine the three requested quantities: required frame rate ($f_{\\mathrm{req}}$), axial step size ($\\Delta z$), and total energy ($E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$). It correctly frames the task as an optimization problem where the most stringent of multiple constraints must be met, which leads to a unique solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative language, free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is determined to be **valid**. It is a self-contained, scientifically sound, and well-posed problem in quantitative biological imaging. Proceeding to solution.\n\nThe solution is derived from the fundamental principles provided. Each requested quantity is calculated in sequence.\n\n**1. Determination of the Minimum Volumetric Frame Rate ($f_{\\mathrm{req}}$)**\n\nThe required volumetric frame rate, $f$, must satisfy two independent constraints: temporal sampling of mitosis and limitation of motion blur. The more stringent of these two constraints will dictate the final required frame rate.\n\nFirst, consider the temporal sampling constraint. To capture an event of duration $T_{\\mathrm{mito}}$ with at least $N$ temporal samples, the volumetric frame rate, which we denote as $f_{1}$, must satisfy:\n$$f_{1} \\geq \\frac{N}{T_{\\mathrm{mito}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values, $N = 8$ and $T_{\\mathrm{mito}} = 120\\,\\mathrm{s}$:\n$$f_{1} \\geq \\frac{8}{120\\,\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{1}{15}\\,\\mathrm{Hz} \\approx 0.0667\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\n\nSecond, consider the motion blur constraint. The displacement of a feature moving at speed $v_{\\max}$ during the acquisition of a single frame (duration $T_{\\mathrm{frame}} = 1/f$) is $v_{\\max} T_{\\mathrm{frame}} = v_{\\max}/f$. This displacement must not exceed a fraction $p$ of the nuclear diameter $d_{n}$. The frame rate, denoted as $f_{2}$, must therefore satisfy:\n$$\\frac{v_{\\max}}{f_{2}} \\leq p\\,d_{n}$$\nRearranging for $f_{2}$ yields the minimum required rate:\n$$f_{2} \\geq \\frac{v_{\\max}}{p\\,d_{n}}$$\nSubstituting the given values, $v_{\\max} = 0.20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $p = 0.10$, and $d_{n} = 5.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$f_{2} \\geq \\frac{0.20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{(0.10)(5.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m})} = \\frac{0.20}{0.50}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 0.40\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\n\nTo satisfy both constraints simultaneously, the frame rate $f_{\\mathrm{req}}$ must be greater than or equal to both minimums. Thus, we must choose the larger of the two:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{req}} = \\max\\left(\\frac{1}{15}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}, 0.40\\,\\mathrm{Hz}\\right) = 0.40\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\nThe motion blur constraint is the limiting factor.\n\n**2. Determination of the Axial Z-Step ($\\Delta z$)**\n\nThe axial sampling step, $\\Delta z$, is also governed by two constraints: the Nyquist sampling criterion based on the optical system's point-spread function and the morphological requirement of imaging the nucleus. The stricter criterion, which corresponds to the smaller step size, must be used.\n\nFirst, consider the Nyquist sampling criterion. To avoid aliasing, the sampling step $\\Delta z_{1}$ should be at most half the full width at half maximum of the axial point-spread function:\n$$\\Delta z_{1} \\leq \\frac{\\mathrm{FWHM}_{z}}{2}$$\nSubstituting the given value $\\mathrm{FWHM}_{z} = 1.20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$\\Delta z_{1} \\leq \\frac{1.20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{2} = 0.60\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n\nSecond, consider the morphological sampling requirement. The problem requires at least $M=7$ z-planes spanning one nuclear diameter, $d_{n}$. For $M$ planes to span a distance $d_{n}$, the distance between the center of the first and the $M$-th plane, which is $(M-1)\\Delta z$, must be at most $d_{n}$. This ensures at least $M$ planes fall within the z-extent of the nucleus. Thus, the step size $\\Delta z_{2}$ must satisfy:\n$$\\Delta z_{2} \\leq \\frac{d_{n}}{M-1}$$\nSubstituting the given values, $d_{n} = 5.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $M = 7$:\n$$\\Delta z_{2} \\leq \\frac{5.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{7-1} = \\frac{5.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{6} \\approx 0.833\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n\nThe stricter sampling requirement is the one that demands the smaller step size. Comparing the two maximum allowed step sizes:\n$$\\Delta z = \\min(\\Delta z_{1}, \\Delta z_{2}) = \\min(0.60\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}, 0.833\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}) = 0.60\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nThe Nyquist criterion is the limiting factor for axial sampling.\n\n**3. Determination of the Total Delivered Energy ($E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$)**\n\nThe total energy delivered to the specimen is the product of the average power and the total time the laser is on. The problem states that the laser is on continuously for the entire imaging session.\nThe total duration of the imaging session, $T_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, spans two consecutive cell cycles.\n$$T_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 2 \\times T_{\\mathrm{cc}}$$\nGiven $T_{\\mathrm{cc}} = 12.0\\,\\mathrm{min}$. First, convert this to SI units (seconds):\n$$T_{\\mathrm{cc}} = 12.0\\,\\mathrm{min} \\times \\frac{60\\,\\mathrm{s}}{1\\,\\mathrm{min}} = 720\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nTherefore, the total imaging time is:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 2 \\times 720\\,\\mathrm{s} = 1440\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe average power is given as $P = 15\\,\\mathrm{mW}$.
