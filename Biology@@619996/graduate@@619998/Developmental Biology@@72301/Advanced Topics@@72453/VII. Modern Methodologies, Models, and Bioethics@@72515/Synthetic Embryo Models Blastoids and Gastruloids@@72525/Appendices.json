The characteristic length scale, which we will denote by $\\lambda$, is the intrinsic spatial scale over which solutions to this equation vary. We can identify this scale through dimensional analysis or by non-dimensionalizing the equation.

The chain rule for differentiation gives $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} = (1/\\lambda)\\nabla_{\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}}$, and consequently, the Laplacian operator transforms as $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}^2 = (1/\\lambda^2)\\nabla_{\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}}^2$.

This implies a steep concentration gradient. In a simplified one-dimensional geometry, the concentration profile away from a source at $x=0$ would decay as $c(x) = c_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda_W)$. A cell at the opposite end of the aggregate diameter (a distance of $L_{agg} = 300\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ from the source) would experience a concentration of $c(300) = c_0 \\exp(-300/63.2) \\approx c_0 \\exp(-4.75) \\approx 0.0087 c_0$.\n\nThis concentration is less than $1\\%$ of the concentration near the source. In biological systems, such a low concentration is often below the threshold required to elicit a cellular response. The effective signaling range of the morphogen is thus limited to a few characteristic lengths (e.g., within $2\\lambda_W \\approx 126\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ to $3\\lambda_W \\approx 190\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$), beyond which the concentration is negligible. Therefore, a single localized source primarily imposes a physiologically relevant gradient within a local neighborhood of the source, rather than across the entire aggregate. The region far from the source will experience a uniformly low, likely non-functional, concentration of Wnt.\n\nFinally, we report the numerical value requested.
