At long times after each pressure step, the aspirated length is stationary. Assume that at these long times the aggregate behaves as an incompressible liquid endowed with an effective interfacial (surface) tension $\\gamma$, and that gravity is negligible. The aggregate is initially a sphere of radius $R_{0}$ and is aspirated into a cylindrical pipette of inner radius $R_{p}$. At steady state for each applied suction, the aspirated “tongue” inside the pipette has length $L$ and ends in a smoothly rounded cap that is locally spherical and matches the pipette radius. The interior pressure is spatially uniform at steady state.\n\nUsing only (i) the Laplace law across a curved interface, namely that a pressure jump across a spherical interface of radius $R$ equals $2\\gamma/R$, (ii) uniform interior pressure at equilibrium, and (iii) conservation of volume with the aspirated portion inside the pipette equal to a right circular cylinder of length $L$ plus a spherical cap that matches the pipette, derive an expression that relates the applied suction $\\Delta P$ to $\\gamma$, $R_{p}$, and the outside radius $R_{\\mathrm{out}}(L)$ of the remaining external spherical portion.

The problem is scientifically sound and well-posed, and all necessary information is provided.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing physical principles. At steady state, the aggregate behaves as an incompressible liquid drop. This implies two conditions: conservation of total volume, and mechanical equilibrium governed by Laplace's law at the curved interfaces.\n\nLet us begin with the pressure balance. We denote the pressure in the external medium as $P_{\\mathrm{out}}$, the pressure inside the pipette as $P_{\\mathrm{pip}}$, and the uniform pressure inside the aggregate as $P_{\\mathrm{agg}}$. The applied suction pressure is defined as $\\Delta P = P_{\\mathrm{out}} - P_{\\mathrm{pip}}$.\nThere are two curved interfaces. The first is the external portion of the aggregate, which is assumed to be a sphere of radius $R_{\\mathrm{out}}$. The pressure jump across this interface is given by Laplace's law:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{agg}} - P_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R_{\\mathrm{out}}}$$\nThe second interface is the cap of the aspirated tongue inside the pipette. It is described as a \"smoothly rounded cap that is locally spherical and matches the pipette radius\". This implies it is a spherical cap with a radius of curvature equal to the pipette inner radius, $R_{p}$. The pressure jump across this cap is:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{agg}} - P_{\\mathrm{pip}} = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R_{p}}$$\nThis second equation assumes a zero contact angle between the aggregate and the pipette wall, resulting in a hemispherical cap.\nTo find an expression for the applied suction $\\Delta P$, we subtract the first equation from the second:\n$$(P_{\\mathrm{agg}} - P_{\\mathrm{pip}}) - (P_{\\mathrm{agg}} - P_{\\mathrm{out}}) = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R_{p}} - \\frac{2\\gamma}{R_{\\mathrm{out}}}$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{out}} - P_{\\mathrm{pip}} = \\Delta P = 2\\gamma \\left(\\frac{1}{R_{p}} - \\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{out}}}\\right)$$\nThis is the required relationship between $\\Delta P$, $\\gamma$, $R_{p}$, and $R_{\\mathrm{out}}$.\n\nNext, we must relate $R_{\\mathrm{out}}$ to the aspirated length $L$ using the principle of volume conservation. The initial volume of the spherical aggregate is $V_{0} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_{0}^{3}$.\nAfter aspiration, this volume is partitioned into the volume inside the pipette, $V_{\\mathrm{in}}$, and the volume of the external spherical part, $V_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_{\\mathrm{out}}^{3}$.\nThe volume inside the pipette, $V_{\\mathrm{in}}$, is composed of a right circular cylinder and a spherical cap. The problem states that the aspirated tongue has length $L$. For $L \\ge R_{p}$, the tongue consists of a cylindrical section of radius $R_{p}$ and length $L-R_{p}$, and a hemispherical cap of radius $R_{p}$. The volume is:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{in}} = V_{\\mathrm{cylinder}} + V_{\\mathrm{cap}} = \\pi R_{p}^{2}(L - R_{p}) + \\frac{2}{3}\\pi R_{p}^{3}$$\nThis is valid for all data points provided, as $L_{1}=R_{p}$, $L_{2}>R_{p}$, and $L_{3}>R_{p}$.\nBy conservation of volume, $V_{0} = V_{\\mathrm{in}} + V_{\\mathrm{out}}$:\n$$\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_{0}^{3} = \\left( \\pi R_{p}^{2}(L - R_{p}) + \\frac{2}{3}\\pi R_{p}^{3} \\right) + \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_{\\mathrm{out}}^{3}$$\nDividing by $\\pi$ and rearranging to solve for $R_{\\mathrm{out}}^{3}$:\n$$\\frac{4}{3}R_{\\mathrm{out}}^{3} = \\frac{4}{3}R_{0}^{3} - R_{p}^{2}(L-R_{p}) - \\frac{2}{3}R_{p}^{3}$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{out}}^{3} = R_{0}^{3} - \\frac{3}{4}R_{p}^{2}(L-R_{p}) - \\frac{1}{2}R_{p}^{3}$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{out}}^{3} = R_{0}^{3} - \\frac{3}{4}R_{p}^{2}L + \\frac{3}{4}R_{p}^{3} - \\frac{1}{2}R_{p}^{3} = R_{0}^{3} - \\frac{3}{4}R_{p}^{2}L + \\frac{1}{4}R_{p}^{3}$$\nThus, $R_{\\mathrm{out}}(L)$ is given by:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{out}}(L) = \\left( R_{0}^{3} - \\frac{3}{4}R_{p}^{2}L + \\frac{1}{4}R_{p}^{3} \\right)^{1/3}$$\nNow we proceed to calculate $\\gamma$ from the experimental data. All calculations will use SI units.\nGiven: $R_{0} = 100~\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 1 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{m}$ and $R_{p} = 20~\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 2 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{m}$.\nWe have $R_{0}^{3} = 1 \\times 10^{-12}~\\mathrm{m}^{3}$, $R_{p}^{2} = 4 \\times 10^{-10}~\\mathrm{m}^{2}$, and $R_{p}^{3} = 8 \\times 10^{-15}~\\mathrm{m}^{3}$.\nThe term $\\frac{1}{4}R_{p}^{3} = \\frac{1}{4}(8 \\times 10^{-15}) = 2 \\times 10^{-15}~\\mathrm{m}^{3}$.\n\nFor each data point $(\\Delta P_{i}, L_{i})$, we first compute $R_{\\mathrm{out},i}$ and then solve for $\\gamma_{i}$.\n$$ \\gamma_{i} = \\frac{\\Delta P_{i}}{2 \\left(\\frac{1}{R_{p}} - \\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{out},i}}\\right)} $$\nData point 1: $\\Delta P_{1} = 399.664~\\mathrm{Pa}$, $L_{1} = 20~\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 2 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{out},1}^{3} = 10^{-12} - \\frac{3}{4}(4 \\times 10^{-10})(2 \\times 10^{-5}) + 2 \\times 10^{-15} = 10^{-12} - 6 \\times 10^{-15} + 2 \\times 10^{-15} = 996 \\times 10^{-15}~\\mathrm{m}^{3} $$\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{out},1} = (996 \\times 10^{-15})^{1/3}~\\mathrm{m} \\approx 9.98665 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ \\gamma_{1} = \\frac{399.664}{2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2 \\times 10^{-5}} - \\frac{1}{9.98665 \\times 10^{-5}}\\right)} \\approx \\frac{399.664}{2(50000 - 10013.36)} = \\frac{399.664}{79973.28} \\approx 0.0049975~\\mathrm{N/m} $$\n\nData point 2: $\\Delta P_{2} = 399.486~\\mathrm{Pa}$, $L_{2} = 40~\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 4 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{out},2}^{3} = 10^{-12} - \\frac{3}{4}(4 \\times 10^{-10})(4 \\times 10^{-5}) + 2 \\times 10^{-15} = 10^{-12} - 12 \\times 10^{-15} + 2 \\times 10^{-15} = 990 \\times 10^{-15}~\\mathrm{m}^{3} $$\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{out},2} = (990 \\times 10^{-15})^{1/3}~\\mathrm{m} \\approx 9.96656 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ \\gamma_{2} = \\frac{399.486}{2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2 \\times 10^{-5}} - \\frac{1}{9.96656 \\times 10^{-5}}\\right)} \\approx \\frac{399.486}{2(50000 - 10033.56)} = \\frac{399.486}{79932.88} \\approx 0.0049978~\\mathrm{N/m} $$\n\nData point 3: $\\Delta P_{3} = 399.263~\\mathrm{Pa}$, $L_{3} = 60~\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 6 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{out},3}^{3} = 10^{-12} - \\frac{3}{4}(4 \\times 10^{-10})(6 \\times 10^{-5}) + 2 \\times 10^{-15} = 10^{-12} - 18 \\times 10^{-15} + 2 \\times 10^{-15} = 984 \\times 10^{-15}~\\mathrm{m}^{3} $$\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{out},3} = (984 \\times 10^{-15})^{1/3}~\\mathrm{m} \\approx 9.94622 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ \\gamma_{3} = \\frac{399.263}{2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2 \\times 10^{-5}} - \\frac{1}{9.94622 \\times 10^{-5}}\\right)} \\approx \\frac{399.263}{2(50000 - 10054.07)} = \\frac{399.263}{79891.86} \\approx 0.0050000~\\mathrm{N/m} $$\n\nThe three values for $\\gamma$ are exceptionally consistent. The \"single best estimate\" is their average:\n$$ \\bar{\\gamma} = \\frac{\\gamma_{1} + \\gamma_{2} + \\gamma_{3}}{3} = \\frac{0.0049975 + 0.0049978 + 0.0050000}{3} = \\frac{0.0149953}{3} \\approx 0.0049984~\\mathrm{N/m} $$\nConverting to the requested units of $\\mathrm{mN/m}$:\n$$ \\bar{\\gamma} \\approx 4.9984~\\mathrm{mN/m} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the result is $5.00~\\mathrm{mN/m}$.\n\nFinally, we address the correction factors.\nIf the aggregate exhibits viscoelasticity, it possesses both fluid-like (viscous) and solid-like (elastic) properties. The pure liquid-drop model is then an oversimplification. A viscoelastic material resists deformation not only through surface tension but also through internal viscous dissipation and elastic stresses. The equilibrium pressure required for a given deformation would depend on the material's elastic modulus $E$. The Laplace equation would need to be augmented with an elastic term, fundamentally changing the relationship. The apparent surface tension calculated using the simple liquid model would likely be an overestimate of the true thermodynamic surface tension, as it would lump elastic contributions into the 'tension' term. Furthermore, the approach to steady state would be governed by a relaxation time $\\tau$, and the measurement would be valid only for observation times much longer than $\\tau$.\n\nIf the liquid-glass contact angle $\\theta_{c}$ at the inner pipette wall is not zero, the assumption of a hemispherical cap is incorrect. The radius of curvature of the cap, $R_{\\text{cap}}$, would be related to the pipette radius by $R_{p} = R_{\\text{cap}} \\cos(\\theta_{c})$. The pressure jump across the cap would become $2\\gamma / R_{\\text{cap}} = 2\\gamma \\cos(\\theta_{c}) / R_{p}$. The suction pressure equation would be modified to $\\Delta P = 2\\gamma (\\frac{\\cos(\\theta_{c})}{R_{p}} - \\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{out}}})$. Since $\\cos(\\theta_{c}) < 1$ for $\\theta_{c} > 0$, the term in parentheses is smaller for a given geometry. To generate the same measured $\\Delta P$, the true value of $\\gamma$ must be larger than the one calculated assuming $\\theta_{c}=0$. Therefore, ignoring a non-zero contact angle leads to an underestimation of the surface tension. The volume of the cap would also be a spherical segment, not a hemisphere, which would slightly alter the volume conservation calculation for $R_{\\mathrm{out}}(L)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.00}$$", "id": "2685772"}, {"introduction": "With a method to measure tissue tension, a key question arises: what are its molecular origins?

It poses a rigorous question about experimental design and interpretation in modern quantitative cell biology. I will therefore proceed to a full solution.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe core task is to distinguish between the Differential Adhesion Hypothesis (DAH) and the Differential Interfacial Tension Hypothesis (DITH). We must first establish the specific, testable predictions of each hypothesis based on the provided experimental framework.\n\nThe provided assumption is that the initial recoil velocity $v_{0,j}$ is directly proportional to the junctional tension $T_j$. Thus, measuring $v_{0,j}$ is equivalent to measuring $T_j$ up to a constant factor.\n\n**1. Differential Adhesion Hypothesis (DAH)**\nThe DAH, proposed by Steinberg, posits that tissue surface tension and cell sorting are driven by differences in the adhesive free energy between cells. The total free energy is minimized when the sum of bond energies is maximized. Junctional tension $T_j$ in this framework is inversely related to the work of adhesion $W_j$. A stronger adhesive interface (higher $W_j$) is more energetically favorable, corresponding to a *lower* interfacial tension.\n-   $T_j \\propto -W_j$.\n-   Since $I^{\\mathrm{cad}}_{j}$ is a proxy for adhesion strength, we predict $T_j$ will be anti-correlated with $I^{\\mathrm{cad}}_{j}$.\n-   Therefore, the key prediction for DAH is: $\\mathrm{corr}(v_{0}, I^{\\mathrm{cad}}) < 0$.\n-   Sorting occurs if heterotypic adhesion is weaker than the average of homotypic adhesions. This implies $T_{XY}$ would be higher than $T_{XX}$ and $T_{YY}$ because of lower $X\\mbox{-}Y$ adhesion.\n-   A causal test for DAH would involve equalizing E-cadherin levels. If differential adhesion is the sole driver, this perturbation should abolish differential tension and, consequently, cell sorting.\n\n**2. Differential Interfacial Tension Hypothesis (DITH)**\nThe DITH is a more general model where junctional tension arises from two opposing contributions: active actomyosin contractility ($\\gamma_j$), which increases tension, and cell-cell adhesion ($w_j$), which decreases it. A simplified form is $T_j \\approx \\gamma_j - w_j$. DITH proposes that differential sorting is primarily driven by differences in cortical contractility ($\\gamma_j$) between junction types, rather than adhesion.\n-   In this case, tension $T_j$ is primarily determined by the contractility term $\\gamma_j$.\n-   Since $I^{\\mathrm{pMLC}}_{j}$ is a proxy for actomyosin contractility, we predict $T_j$ will be positively correlated with $I^{\\mathrm{pMLC}}_{j}$.\n-   Therefore, the key prediction for DITH is: $\\mathrm{corr}(v_{0}, I^{\\mathrm{pMLC}}) > 0$.\n-   The role of adhesion is secondary. While adhesion levels might vary, they are not the primary determinant of *differential* tension.\n-   A causal test for DITH would involve inhibiting contractility. Using a ROCK inhibitor should decrease or abolish differential contractility, which in turn should eliminate differential tension and stop cell sorting. Conversely, manipulating adhesion levels (e.g., equalizing cadherin) should have little to no effect on differential tension or sorting.\n\nThe question asks for the strategy and outcome that would support DITH and falsify DAH. We are looking for an option that describes:\n1.  A strong positive correlation between tension ($v_0$) and contractility ($I^{\\mathrm{pMLC}}$).\n2.  A weak or non-existent correlation between tension and adhesion ($I^{\\mathrm{cad}}$) once the effect of contractility is accounted for.\n3.  Abolition of differential tension and sorting upon inhibiting contractility (ROCKi).\n4.  Persistence of differential tension and sorting upon equalizing adhesion.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Measure $v_{0,j}$ and $I^{\\mathrm{cad}}_{j}$ across all junction classes, compute the correlation $\\mathrm{corr}(v_{0},I^{\\mathrm{cad}})$, then equalize $I^{\\mathrm{cad}}$ between $X$ and $Y$ and reassess. Prediction: a strong negative $\\mathrm{corr}(v_{0},I^{\\mathrm{cad}})$ at baseline that disappears when $I^{\\mathrm{cad}}$ is equalized; ROCK inhibition reduces $v_{0}$ uniformly without abolishing $X\\mbox{-}Y$ sorting. Conclusion: adhesion differences set $T$; DITH is not required.**\n\nThis option describes a scenario that is perfectly consistent with the DAH. A strong negative correlation between tension ($v_0$) and adhesion ($I^{\\mathrm{cad}}$) is the central prediction of DAH. The disappearance of this effect upon equalizing cadherin levels would be strong causal evidence for DAH. The described outcome falsifies DITH, rather than supporting it. Therefore, this option is incorrect as an answer to the posed question.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Measure $v_{0,j}$, $I^{\\mathrm{cad}}_{j}$, and $I^{\\mathrm{pMLC}}_{j}$, compute partial correlations $\\mathrm{corr}(v_{0},I^{\\mathrm{cad}}\\mid I^{\\mathrm{pMLC}})$ and $\\mathrm{corr}(v_{0},I^{\\mathrm{pMLC}}\\mid I^{\\mathrm{cad}})$, then perform both perturbations. Prediction: $v_{0}$ correlates with $I^{\\mathrm{pMLC}}$ but not with $I^{\\mathrm{cad}}$ at baseline; equalizing $I^{\\mathrm{cad}}$ does not change $v_{0}$ differences between junction classes nor $X\\mbox{-}Y$ segregation, whereas ROCK inhibition abolishes both $v_{0}$ differences and $X\\mbox{-}Y$ segregation. Conclusion: cortical contractility sets $T$ independent of adhesion abundance; supports DITH over DAH.**\n\nThis option outlines a rigorous experimental and analytical plan. The use of partial correlation is critical; it allows one to disentangle the respective contributions of adhesion and contractility to tension. The predicted outcome aligns precisely with the DITH:\n-   `v_0` (tension) correlates with `I_pMLC` (contractility), but not with `I_cad` (adhesion) after controlling for the other variable. This points to contractility as the primary driver.\n-   The perturbation experiments provide causal evidence. Equalizing adhesion has no effect, falsifying its role as the primary driver. Inhibiting contractility abolishes differential tension and sorting, confirming its causal role.\nThis entire suite of results provides decisive evidence for DITH while falsifying DAH.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Measure $v_{0,j}$ and $I^{\\mathrm{cad}}_{j}$ and normalize $v_{0}$ by junction length to obtain $v_{0}/\\ell$. Prediction: a strong positive $\\mathrm{corr}(v_{0}/\\ell,I^{\\mathrm{cad}})$ that persists after ROCK inhibition but is eliminated by equalizing $I^{\\mathrm{cad}}$. Conclusion: higher adhesion increases interfacial tension; supports DITH because adhesion strengthens contractile cables.**\n\nThis option is flawed in multiple respects.\n-   The normalization $v_0/\\ell$ is not justified by the provided biophysical model ($v_0 \\propto T$), where $T$ is the force.\n-   The core prediction is a positive correlation between tension and adhesion. While biologically possible under certain complex models where adhesion scaffolds the cytoskeleton, it contradicts the classical DAH and is not the primary tenet of DITH.\n-   The predicted outcome of the perturbation is contradictory. If the correlation \"persists after ROCK inhibition,\" it implies that differential contractility is *not* responsible for the differential tension, which directly falsifies the DITH. Yet, the conclusion claims to support DITH. This is logically inconsistent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Measure $v_{0,j}$, $I^{\\mathrm{cad}}_{j}$, and $I^{\\mathrm{pMLC}}_{j}$ and fit a multiple regression $v_{0}=\\alpha+\\beta_{\\mathrm{cad}}I^{\\mathrm{cad}}+\\beta_{\\mathrm{pMLC}}I^{\\mathrm{pMLC}}+\\epsilon$. Prediction: neither coefficient is significant at baseline, and neither ROCK inhibition nor cadherin equalization changes junction-class differences in $v_{0}$ or sorting. Conclusion: both DAH and DITH are consistent, so neither can be falsified.**\n\nThis option describes a null result. A failure to find any correlation or causal link means the experiment is inconclusive. It does not mean \"both DAH and DITH are consistent\". On the contrary, such a result would fail to support *either* hypothesis. The task is to find a strategy that *decisively discriminates* between the hypotheses, not one that fails to do so. Therefore, this option describes an unsuccessful experiment and is not the correct answer.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2685777"}, {"introduction": "This final practice focuses on the predictive power of the Differential Interfacial Tension Hypothesis (DITH), which posits that both cortical contractility and cell adhesion determine sorting outcomes. You will apply the DITH framework to a quantitative problem involving a specific molecular perturbation—the inhibition of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK). This exercise will solidify your understanding of how manipulating molecular-level components can alter macroscopic tissue organization, a central principle in developmental mechanics [@problem_id:2685750].", "problem": "A mixed aggregate consists of two cell populations, type A and type B, which express the same level and affinity of E-cadherin. According to the Differential Interfacial Tension Hypothesis (DITH), interfacial tensions in such systems emerge from a balance between cortical contractility and adhesion, and multicellular arrangements minimize total interfacial energy. Assume that Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) modulates non-muscle myosin II activity so that increasing ROCK activity increases cortical tension, while cadherin-mediated adhesion is unaffected by ROCK. In the initial state, type A cells have higher basal ROCK activity than type B cells, yielding cortical tensions $\\tau_A = 1.0$ and $\\tau_B = 0.6$ (arbitrary units). Cadherin affinity and density are identical across all contacts, so that the adhesion energy per unit length for any cell-cell contact is $W_{AA} = W_{BB} = W_{AB} = 0.4$. At a free surface with the culture medium, adhesion is negligible, so $W_{iM} \\approx 0$ for $i \\in \\{A,B\\}$. You apply a ROCK inhibitor that lowers cortical tension in type A by $50\\%$ and in type B by $10\\%$, without altering cadherin affinity or expression.

The use of \"arbitrary units\" is acceptable for a problem designed to test understanding of the principles rather than to yield a specific real-world numerical value.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution can be derived from first principles.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe sorting of cells in a mixed aggregate, according to the Differential Interfacial Tension Hypothesis (DITH), is governed by the minimization of the total interfacial free energy of the system, analogous to the behavior of immiscible fluids. The final configuration will be the one that minimizes this energy.\n\nThe interfacial tension between a tissue of cell type $i$ and the surrounding medium ($M$) is denoted as $\\gamma_{iM}$. This tension is primarily a function of the cell's cortical tension, $\\tau_i$, and the adhesion energy to the medium, $W_{iM}$. A standard model is $\\gamma_{iM} \\approx \\tau_i - W_{iM}$. Given that adhesion to the medium is negligible ($W_{iM} \\approx 0$), the surface tension is approximately equal to the cortical tension:\n$$ \\gamma_{iM} \\approx \\tau_i $$\nWhen two cell populations, A and B, are mixed, they will sort out to minimize the total energy. The population with the higher surface tension with the medium will be enclosed by the population with the lower surface tension. This minimizes the high-energy interface. Thus, cell type A will become internal to type B if $\\gamma_{AM} > \\gamma_{BM}$.\n\nThe heterotypic interfacial tension between cell types A and B, $\\gamma_{AB}$, is determined by the cortical tensions of both cell types and their mutual adhesion energy, $W_{AB}$. A simple and plausible model, consistent with the problem's description of a \"balance,\" is:\n$$ \\gamma_{AB} = \\tau_A + \\tau_B - W_{AB} $$\n\nWe will now apply these principles to the initial and final states described in the problem.\n\n**Initial State Analysis:**\n\nThe given initial parameters are:\n-   $\\tau_A^{\\text{initial}} = 1.0$\n-   $\\tau_B^{\\text{initial}} = 0.6$\n-   $W_{AB} = 0.4$\n\nFirst, determine the initial sorting configuration by comparing the surface tensions against the medium:\n-   $\\gamma_{AM}^{\\text{initial}} \\approx \\tau_A^{\\text{initial}} = 1.0$\n-   $\\gamma_{BM}^{\\text{initial}} \\approx \\tau_B^{\\text{initial}} = 0.6$\n\nSince $\\gamma_{AM}^{\\text{initial}} > \\gamma_{BM}^{\\text{initial}}$ ($1.0 > 0.6$), the system minimizes its energy by internalizing the cell type with the higher surface tension. Therefore, in the initial state, type A cells form the internal core, and type B cells form the external layer.\n\nNext, calculate the initial heterotypic interfacial tension:\n$$ \\gamma_{AB}^{\\text{initial}} = \\tau_A^{\\text{initial}} + \\tau_B^{\\text{initial}} - W_{AB} = 1.0 + 0.6 - 0.4 = 1.2 $$\n\n**Final State Analysis (after ROCK Inhibition):**\n\nThe ROCK inhibitor alters the cortical tensions:\n-   Type A tension decreases by $50\\%$: $\\tau_A^{\\text{final}} = \\tau_A^{\\text{initial}} \\times (1 - 0.50) = 1.0 \\times 0.5 = 0.5$\n-   Type B tension decreases by $10\\%$: $\\tau_B^{\\text{final}} = \\tau_B^{\\text{initial}} \\times (1 - 0.10) = 0.6 \\times 0.9 = 0.54$\nThe adhesion energies remain unchanged.\n\nNow, determine the final sorting configuration:\n-   $\\gamma_{AM}^{\\text{final}} \\approx \\tau_A^{\\text{final}} = 0.5$\n-   $\\gamma_{BM}^{\\text{final}} \\approx \\tau_B^{\\text{final}} = 0.54$\n\nIn the final state, $\\gamma_{BM}^{\\text{final}} > \\gamma_{AM}^{\\text{final}}$ ($0.54 > 0.5$). This represents a reversal of the surface tension hierarchy. To minimize energy, type B cells, which now have the higher surface tension, will be internalized by type A cells. The sorting configuration reverses: B becomes internal, and A becomes external.\n\nFinally, calculate the final heterotypic interfacial tension:\n$$ \\gamma_{AB}^{\\text{final}} = \\tau_A^{\\text{final}} + \\tau_B^{\\text{final}} - W_{AB} = 0.5 + 0.54 - 0.4 = 0.64 $$\n\n**Comparison of States:**\n\n1.  **Change in Heterotypic Interfacial Tension**: Compare $\\gamma_{AB}^{\\text{final}}$ with $\\gamma_{AB}^{\\text{initial}}$. Since $0.64 < 1.2$, the heterotypic interfacial tension decreases.\n2.  **Change in Sorting Outcome**: The initial configuration is A internal to B. The final configuration is B internal to A. The sorting order reverses.\n\nBased on this derivation, the correct description of the outcome is that the heterotypic interfacial tension decreases, and the sorting reverses, with B becoming internal and A becoming external.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n-   **A. The heterotypic interfacial tension decreases; the sorting reverses so that B becomes internal and A external.**\n    -   Our calculation shows $\\gamma_{AB}$ decreases from $1.2$ to $0.64$. This is correct.\n    -   Our analysis shows the sorting hierarchy reverses from A-internal to B-internal. This is correct.\n    -   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n-   **B.

The sorting reverses. The statement about \"sorting weakens\" is also interpretable; the driving force for sorting, proportional to $|\\gamma_{AM} - \\gamma_{BM}|$, decreases from $|1.0 - 0.6| = 0.4$ to $|0.5 - 0.54| = 0.04$. While the sorting preference weakens, the claim about the final configuration is wrong.\n    -   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **D. The heterotypic interfacial tension increases; the sorting reverses so that B becomes internal and A external.**\n    -   \"increases\": This is incorrect. $\\gamma_{AB}$ decreases.\n    -   \"the sorting reverses\": This is correct.\n    -   Since the first part of the statement is false, the option as a whole is incorrect.\n    -   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nOnly option A is fully consistent with the application of the Differential Interfacial Tension Hypothesis to the given problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2685750"}]}
