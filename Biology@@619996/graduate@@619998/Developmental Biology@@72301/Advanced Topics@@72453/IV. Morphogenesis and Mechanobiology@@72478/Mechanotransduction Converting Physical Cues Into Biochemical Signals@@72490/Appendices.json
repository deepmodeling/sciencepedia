It is well-posed, providing a clear objective and all necessary information and assumptions (e.g., force-independent pre-factor and transition state location) to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the specified criteria for invalidity. It is a standard, solvable problem in theoretical biophysics.\n\nStep 3: Verdict\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the provided foundational bases. According to Transition State Theory in the high-friction limit, the rate of dissociation, $k_{\\text{off}}$, is given by an Arrhenius-like expression:\n$$\nk_{\\text{off}} = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the pre-exponential factor, or attempt frequency, which depends on the vibrational frequencies in the bound state and the shape of the barrier. $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ is the activation free energy, which is the difference in free energy between the transition state and the bound state minimum.\n\nAt zero applied force, $F=0$, the off-rate is denoted $k_0$. The activation free energy is $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(0)$. The expression for the rate is:\n$$\nk_0 = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(0)}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that in the regime of interest, the pre-factor $A$ can be considered independent of the force $F$.\n\nWhen an external tensile force $F$ is applied, the free energy landscape is altered. The new, force-dependent free energy profile is given as $U_F(q) = U_0(q) - F q$. We must calculate the new activation free energy, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(F)$. This is the energy difference between the transition state and the bound state in the presence of the force.\n\nThe energy of the bound state, located at $q=0$, is:\n$$\nU_F(0) = U_0(0) - F(0) = U_0(0)\n$$\nThe problem states that for small forces, the location of the transition state is not appreciably altered and remains at $q=x_b$. The energy of the transition state is therefore:\n$$\nU_F(x_b) = U_0(x_b) - F x_b\n$$\nThe force-dependent activation free energy, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(F)$, is the difference between these two energy levels:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(F) = U_F(x_b) - U_F(0) = (U_0(x_b) - F x_b) - U_0(0)\n$$\nBy rearranging the terms, we can separate the zero-force component from the force-dependent component:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(F) = [U_0(x_b) - U_0(0)] - F x_b\n$$\nWe identify the term in the brackets as the activation free energy in the absence of force, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(0) = U_0(x_b) - U_0(0)$. Thus, the new activation energy is lowered by an amount equal to the work done by the force to move the system to the transition state:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(F) = \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(0) - F x_b\n$$\nNow, we can write the expression for the force-dependent off-rate, $k_{\\text{off}}(F)$, using this new activation energy:\n$$\nk_{\\text{off}}(F) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(F)}{k_B T}\\right) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(0) - F x_b}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the properties of the exponential function, we can split the expression into two factors:\n$$\nk_{\\text{off}}(F) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(0)}{k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{F x_b}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThe first part of this expression, $A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(0)}{k_B T}\\right)$, is identical to the expression for the zero-force off-rate, $k_0$. Substituting $k_0$ into the equation yields the final closed-form expression:\n$$\nk_{\\text{off}}(F) = k_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{F x_b}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the Bell model expression for the force-dependent dissociation rate.\n\nJustification of the physical range of validity:\nThis expression rests on several key assumptions, which define its range of applicability in mechanotransduction contexts.\n1.  **Small Force and Rigid Landscape**: The derivation assumes that the force $F$ does not significantly alter the geometry of the reaction pathway, specifically the location of the transition state $x_b$ and the curvatures of the potential well and barrier (which define the pre-factor $A$). This approximation is valid when the mechanical work done on the bond, $F x_b$, is much smaller than the intrinsic activation energy barrierheight, i.e., $F x_b \\ll \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(0)$. For typical biological bonds, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(0)$ is on the order of $10-25$ $k_B T$, and $x_b$ is on the order of angstroms to a few nanometers ($10^{-10}-10^{-9}$ m). This implies the model is valid for forces typically up to tens of piconewtons ($10^{-12}$ N), which is a relevant range for many cellular processes. At higher forces, the landscape itself deforms, and $x_b$ becomes a function of $F$.\n2.  **Overdamped Dynamics and Timescale Separation**: The use of TST in the high-friction (overdamped) regime assumes that inertial effects are negligible and that the system's motion is dominated by viscous drag from the cellular environment. This is an excellent assumption for macromolecules in aqueous solution at physiological temperatures, where the Reynolds number is very small. It also implicitly assumes a separation of timescales: the thermal equilibration of the molecule within the potential well must be much faster than the rate of escape over the barrier. This condition is generally met for barriers that are several $k_B T$ high, ensuring that the bond state is well-defined.\n3.  **One-Dimensional Reaction Coordinate**: The model simplifies a complex, multi-dimensional unbinding process into motion along a single coordinate $q$. This is a reasonable approximation if there exists a dominant, low-energy dissociation pathway and the applied force vector is aligned with this pathway. Its validity diminishes if unbinding can occur via multiple distinct pathways or if the force pulls the system in a direction orthogonal to the natural unbinding coordinate.\n4.  **Slip Bonds Only**: The model inherently describes what are known as \"slip bonds\", where the lifetime of the bond ($1/k_{\\text{off}}$) decreases monotonically with applied tensile force. This is because $x_b$ is defined as a positive constant. The model does not apply to \"catch bonds\", which are specialized bonds that strengthen (i.e., their off-rate decreases) over an intermediate range of forces. Catch bonds require more complex energy landscapes with multiple states and pathways that are differentially affected by force. The derived expression is therefore valid only for systems that do not exhibit catch-bond behavior.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{k_{0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{F x_{b}}{k_{B} T}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2651871"}, {"introduction": "From the behavior of single molecules, we now scale up to probe the mechanical properties of the entire cell.

We will address them in sequence.\n\nTask 1: Derivation of the force-indentation relationship.\n\nThe problem considers the indentation of a linear elastic half-space by a rigid spherical indenter. This is the classical Hertzian contact problem, whose solution gives the relationship between the applied force $F$ and the resulting indentation depth $\\delta$.

This is a dimensionless quantity representing the extent of actin polymerization, which also depends on substrate stiffness, modeled by a Hill function:\n$$\nA(E) = \\frac{E^h}{E^h + E_a^h}\n$$\nWith the Hill coefficient $h = 2$ and half-activation stiffness $E_a = 5$ kPa.\n\nStep 4: Compute the YAP nuclear import rate, $k_{\\text{in}}(E)$, which depends on the nuclear strain $\\varepsilon_{\\text{n}}(E)$.\n$$\nk_{\\text{in}}(E) = k_{\\text{in},0}\\left(1 + \\gamma\\,\\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\text{n}}(E)}{\\varepsilon_{\\text{n}}(E) + \\varepsilon_{1/2}}\\right)\n$$\nWith parameters $k_{\\text{in},0} = 0.1$ min$^{-1}$, $\\gamma = 4$, and $\\varepsilon_{1/2} = 0.05$.\n\nStep 5: Compute the YAP nuclear export rate, $k_{\\text{out}}(E)$, which is inhibited by the F-actin level $A(E)$.\n$$\nk_{\\text{out}}(E) = \\frac{k_{\\text{out},0}}{1 + \\eta\\,A(E)}\n$$\nWith parameters $k_{\\text{out},0} = 0.3$ min$^{-1}$ and $\\eta = 3$.\n\nStep 6: Finally, substitute the calculated rates $k_{\\text{in}}(E)$ and $k_{\\text{out}}(E)$ into the expression for $N^\\ast(E)$ to obtain the final result.\n\nThis pipeline provides a complete, mechanistic path from the external physical parameter $E$ to the internal biochemical state $N^\\ast(E)$. We will implement this procedure for each given value of $E$ in the test suite.", "answer": "[0.250000,0.301419,0.511394,0.781844,0.852399,0.912389,0.923428,0.933333]", "id": "2651923"}]}
