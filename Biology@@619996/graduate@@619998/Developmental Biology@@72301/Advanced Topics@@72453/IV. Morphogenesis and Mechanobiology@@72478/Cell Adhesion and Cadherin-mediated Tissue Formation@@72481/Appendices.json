Assume that on the aspiration timescale each aggregate behaves as a liquid drop. For each aggregate, the critical aspiration pressure at which a smooth hemispherical tongue forms at the pipette entrance is measured. You may model the interface mechanics using the Young–Laplace relation for capillary pressure and assume that at the onset of tongue formation the curvature inside the pipette is that of a hemisphere of radius equal to the pipette radius.\n\nData:\n- Pipette inner radius: $R_{p} = 20 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Tissue A aggregate radius: $R_{c,A} = 150 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$; critical aspiration pressure: $\\Delta P_{A} = 300 \\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n- Tissue B aggregate radius: $R_{c,B} = 120 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$; critical aspiration pressure: $\\Delta P_{B} = 260 \\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n\nTasks:\n1.

The physical model is based on the Young-Laplace equation, which is the correct and fundamental principle for pressure differences across curved fluid interfaces.

It contains no logical contradictions, factual errors, or ambiguities. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. We proceed to derive the solution.\n\nThe solution is organized according to the tasks specified.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the expression for effective surface tension $\\gamma$**\n\nLet us define the relevant pressures:\n- $P_{0}$: The ambient pressure in the external medium surrounding the aggregate.\n- $P_{in}$: The internal pressure within the aggregate.\n- $P_{p}$: The suction pressure applied within the micropipette.\n\nThe critical aspiration pressure $\\Delta P$ is the difference between the ambient pressure and the pipette pressure:\n$$ \\Delta P = P_{0} - P_{p} $$\n\nThe aggregate has two curved interfaces with the same effective surface tension $\\gamma$. We apply the Young-Laplace equation, $\\Delta P_{interface} = \\gamma (\\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2})$, to each.\n\n1.  For the main spherical portion of the aggregate, with radius $R_c$, the pressure jump from the outside to the inside is:\n    $$ P_{in} - P_{0} = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R_c} $$\n    Here, the principal radii of curvature are both equal to $R_c$.\n\n2.  At the critical pressure, a hemispherical tongue of radius $R_p$ forms inside the pipette. For this interface, the pressure jump from the pipette lumen to the aggregate interior is:\n    $$ P_{in} - P_{p} = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R_p} $$\n    Here, the principal radii of curvature are both equal to $R_p$.\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for the pressures. To find an expression for $\\gamma$, we subtract the first equation from the second:\n$$ (P_{in} - P_{p}) - (P_{in} - P_{0}) = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R_p} - \\frac{2\\gamma}{R_c} $$\nSimplifying the left side, we get:\n$$ P_{0} - P_{p} = 2\\gamma \\left( \\frac{1}{R_p} - \\frac{1}{R_c} \\right) $$\nSubstituting the definition of the critical aspiration pressure, $\\Delta P = P_{0} - P_{p}$:\n$$ \\Delta P = 2\\gamma \\left( \\frac{1}{R_p} - \\frac{1}{R_c} \\right) $$\nFinally, we solve for the effective surface tension $\\gamma$:\n$$ \\gamma = \\frac{\\Delta P}{2 \\left( \\frac{1}{R_p} - \\frac{1}{R_c} \\right)} $$\nThis is the required expression.\n\n**Task 2: Computation of $\\gamma_A$ and $\\gamma_B$**\n\nFirst, convert all given radii to SI units (meters):\n- $R_p = 20 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 20 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- $R_{c,A} = 150 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 150 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- $R_{c,B} = 120 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 120 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe pressures are already given in SI units (Pascals).\n\nFor Tissue A:\n$$ \\gamma_A = \\frac{\\Delta P_A}{2 \\left( \\frac{1}{R_p} - \\frac{1}{R_{c,A}} \\right)} = \\frac{300 \\,\\mathrm{Pa}}{2 \\left( \\frac{1}{20 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{m}} - \\frac{1}{150 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{m}} \\right)} $$\nThe term in the denominator is:\n$$ 2 \\left( \\frac{10^6}{20} - \\frac{10^6}{150} \\right) \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} = 2 \\times 10^6 \\left( \\frac{15 - 2}{300} \\right) \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} = 2 \\times 10^6 \\left( \\frac{13}{300} \\right) \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} = \\frac{26 \\times 10^6}{300} \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} $$\nThus,\n$$ \\gamma_A = \\frac{300}{\\frac{26 \\times 10^6}{300}} \\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} = \\frac{90000}{26 \\times 10^6} \\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} = \\frac{9}{2600} \\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} \\approx 3.46 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} $$\n\nFor Tissue B:\n$$ \\gamma_B = \\frac{\\Delta P_B}{2 \\left( \\frac{1}{R_p} - \\frac{1}{R_{c,B}} \\right)} = \\frac{260 \\,\\mathrm{Pa}}{2 \\left( \\frac{1}{20 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{m}} - \\frac{1}{120 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{m}} \\right)} $$\nThe term in the denominator is:\n$$ 2 \\left( \\frac{10^6}{20} - \\frac{10^6}{120} \\right) \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} = 2 \\times 10^6 \\left( \\frac{6 - 1}{120} \\right) \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} = 2 \\times 10^6 \\left( \\frac{5}{120} \\right) \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} = \\frac{10^7}{120} \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} = \\frac{10^6}{12} \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} $$\nThus,\n$$ \\gamma_B = \\frac{260}{\\frac{10^6}{12}} \\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} = \\frac{260 \\times 12}{10^6} \\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} = \\frac{3120}{10^6} \\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} = 3.12 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} $$\n\n**Task 3: Computation of the ratio $r$**\n\nThe ratio is defined as $r = \\gamma_B / \\gamma_A$.

By the $8$-cell stage, blastomeres increase cell–cell adhesion and establish apical–basal polarity, enabling trophectoderm formation and subsequent blastocoel cavitation. Classical cadherins mediate calcium-dependent homophilic adhesion at adherens junctions; their extracellular domains determine binding specificity, and their cytoplasmic domains couple to catenins and the actin cytoskeleton. Consider a gene-targeted knock-in that replaces the extracellular (ectodomain) portion of E-cadherin (cadherin-$1$) with the ectodomain of N-cadherin (cadherin-$2$), while retaining the E-cadherin transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains and expressing from the endogenous E-cadherin locus at near-wild-type levels. You examine two experimental configurations: (i) a mosaic embryo in which a subset of blastomeres at the $8$-cell stage express the chimera, surrounded by wild-type E-cadherin–expressing neighbors; and (ii) a uniform embryo in which all blastomeres express the chimera.\n\nUse the following fundamental bases to reason your predictions: classical cadherins exhibit predominant homophilic binding specificity, such that the effective affinity hierarchy is $K_{\\mathrm{EE}} > K_{\\mathrm{NN}} \\gg K_{\\mathrm{EN}}$ (E–E stronger than N–N, and E–N heterophilic binding weak); adherens junction assembly and mechanocoupling depend primarily on the cytoplasmic domain–catenin–actin linkage; and the Differential Adhesion Hypothesis (DAH) predicts that mixed cell populations minimize interfacial free energy by maximizing strong homophilic contacts, which can drive cell sorting and layer positioning.\n\nWhich outcome is the most plausible consequence of the ectodomain swap for early morphogenesis, considering both mosaic and uniform expression contexts?\n\nA.

(ii) Uniform embryo where all blastomeres express the chimera.\n- **Governing Principles:**\n    1.  **Homophilic Specificity:** Cadherins exhibit predominant homophilic binding.\n    2.  **Adhesion Hierarchy:** The effective affinity hierarchy is $K_{\\mathrm{EE}} > K_{\\mathrm{NN}} \\gg K_{\\mathrm{EN}}$. This signifies that E-cadherin homophilic adhesion is stronger than N-cadherin homophilic adhesion, and both are significantly stronger than E-cadherin to N-cadherin heterophilic adhesion.\n    3.  **Cytoplasmic Domain Function:** Adherens junction assembly and mechanocoupling are primarily dependent on the cytoplasmic domain–catenin–actin linkage.\n    4.  **Sorting Principle:** The Differential Adhesion Hypothesis (DAH) posits that mixed cell populations rearrange to minimize interfacial free energy by maximizing stronger homophilic contacts, leading to cell sorting.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a logical and experimentally feasible scenario in developmental biology. The premises—the structure of cadherins, their function, the DAH, and the specific adhesion hierarchy—are all well-established concepts in the field. The problem provides a self-contained set of rules and asks for a logical deduction based on them. There are no internal contradictions, factual errors, or ambiguities. The problem is not trivial, as it requires the integration of multiple principles across two distinct experimental conditions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nLet us analyze the cellular interactions based on the provided principles.\nA wild-type (WT) cell expresses E-cadherin on its surface.\nA chimera (CH) cell expresses the N-cadherin ectodomain and E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain.\n\nThe adhesive interactions possible are:\n-   WT–WT adhesion: Mediated by E-cadherin ectodomains. Strength is proportional to $K_{\\mathrm{EE}}$.\n-   CH–CH adhesion: Mediated by N-cadherin ectodomains. Strength is proportional to $K_{\\mathrm{NN}}$.\n-   WT–CH adhesion: Mediated by E-cadherin and N-cadherin ectodomains. Strength is proportional to $K_{\\mathrm{EN}}$.\n\nThe given hierarchy is $K_{\\mathrm{EE}} > K_{\\mathrm{NN}} \\gg K_{\\mathrm{EN}}$.\n\n**Analysis of the Mosaic Embryo (Configuration i):**\nIn a mosaic embryo, we have a mixture of WT and CH cells. According to the Differential Adhesion Hypothesis (DAH), cells will rearrange to achieve the most thermodynamically stable configuration, which involves minimizing the total interfacial free energy. This is accomplished by maximizing the total number of strong adhesive bonds and minimizing the number of weak ones.\n-   The strongest bonds are WT–WT ($K_{\\mathrm{EE}}$).\n-   The intermediate strength bonds are CH–CH ($K_{\\mathrm{NN}}$).\n-   The weakest bonds are WT–CH ($K_{\\mathrm{EN}}$).\n\nThe system will minimize the energetically unfavorable WT–CH interface. This drives the sorting of the two cell populations. The population with the greater cohesive energy (stronger self-adhesion) will tend to form a continuous external layer, enveloping the population with lower cohesive energy.\nHere, the WT cells have the highest cohesion ($K_{\\mathrm{EE}}$). The CH cells have lower cohesion ($K_{\\mathrm{NN}}$) and adhere very poorly to the WT population ($K_{\\mathrm{EN}}$). Therefore, the CH cells will be segregated from the WT cells. In the blastocyst context, the outer layer is the trophectoderm. The more cohesive WT cells will preferentially form this outer layer, while the less cohesive CH cells which also adhere poorly to the WT cells, are excluded from this layer and driven to an internal position.\n\n**Analysis of the Uniform Embryo (Configuration ii):**\nIn a uniform embryo, all blastomeres express the CH protein. All cell-cell adhesion is of the CH–CH type, mediated by N-cadherin ectodomains.\n-   The strength of adhesion throughout the embryo is determined by $K_{\\mathrm{NN}}$.\n-   In a WT embryo, the adhesion strength is determined by $K_{\\mathrm{EE}}$.\n-   Since $K_{\\mathrm{EE}} > K_{\\mathrm{NN}}$, the overall cell-cell adhesion in the uniform chimera embryo is weaker than in a wild-type embryo.\n-   Compaction is the morphological manifestation of increased cell-cell adhesion. Because the adhesion is globally weaker, compaction will still occur (since $K_{\\mathrm{NN}}$ is significant), but it will be less robust or slower compared to wild-type.\n-   Blastocoel formation requires a tight epithelial seal (formed by tight junctions, which are stabilized by underlying adherens junctions) to retain fluid. Weaker compaction and adhesion can compromise this seal, leading to a delay in the formation or expansion of the blastocoel.\n-   The assembly of the adherens junction and its coupling to the actin cytoskeleton is stated to depend on the cytoplasmic domain. The CH protein retains the native E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain. Therefore, the intracellular signaling and mechanical linkage aspects of the adherens junction should function approximately normally. The defect is primarily in the strength of the extracellular bond, not the integrity of the junctional complex itself.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. In mosaics, chimera-expressing blastomeres are excluded from the outer trophectodermal layer and internalize, because E–N heterophilic adhesion is weak; in uniform embryos, compaction occurs but is weaker than wild type, leading to delayed blastocoel formation due to lower N–N homophilic adhesion, while adherens junction assembly remains largely intact via the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain.**\n-   **Mosaic analysis:** This correctly predicts internalization of chimera cells, attributing it to weak E–N adhesion ($K_{\\mathrm{EN}}$). This is consistent with the DAH.\n-   **Uniform analysis:** This correctly predicts weaker compaction due to $K_{\\mathrm{NN}} < K_{\\mathrm{EE}}$, leading to delayed blastocoel formation. It also correctly states that junctional assembly should be intact due to the presence of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. In mosaics, chimera-expressing blastomeres integrate seamlessly into the outer layer because E–N heterophilic binding exceeds E–E homophilic binding; in uniform embryos, compaction fails because the E-cadherin cytoplasmic tail cannot couple to the actin cytoskeleton when paired with an N-cadherin ectodomain.**\n-   **Mosaic analysis:** This claims $K_{\\mathrm{EN}} > K_{\\mathrm{EE}}$, which directly contradicts the given principle $K_{\\mathrm{EE}} \\gg K_{\\mathrm{EN}}$.\n-   **Uniform analysis:** This claims the cytoplasmic domain becomes non-functional, which contradicts the stated principle of modular domain function where the cytoplasmic domain's activity is primary for that role.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. In mosaics, chimera-expressing blastomeres undergo apoptosis triggered by loss of calcium binding in the N-cadherin ectodomain; in uniform embryos, compaction is enhanced and embryos develop faster than wild type due to increased adhesion strength.**\n-   **Mosaic analysis:** This invokes apoptosis due to \"loss of calcium binding,\" a mechanism not supported by the problem statement. N-cadherin is a calcium-dependent cadherin; there is no basis to assume its function is lost.\n-   **Uniform analysis:** This claims \"increased adhesion strength\" ($K_{\\mathrm{NN}} > K_{\\mathrm{EE}}$), which directly contradicts the given hierarchy $K_{\\mathrm{EE}} > K_{\\mathrm{NN}}$.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.

It also falsely states there is an \"absence of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain\" when the problem specifies it is retained.\n-   **Uniform analysis:** This claims \"compaction is normal,\" which is incorrect because adhesion strength is reduced ($K_{\\mathrm{NN}} < K_{\\mathrm{EE}}$).

Cortical tension, $\\tau$, from actomyosin contractility contributes positively to interfacial tension and is increased by RhoA activity.\n    3. Mechanical equilibrium geometry at cell junctions reflects the balance of interfacial tensions.\n- Hypotheses:\n    1. Differential Adhesion Hypothesis (DAH): Sorting is driven by differences in effective adhesion energy, $w$.\n    2. Differential Interfacial Tension Hypothesis (DITH): Sorting is driven by differences in cortical tension, $\\tau$.\n- Objective: To select an experiment and corresponding set of outcomes that would uniquely support the DITH as the dominant mechanism for sorting.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The DAH and DITH are established, competing models in developmental biology. The cellular components (E-cadherin, RhoA, actomyosin) and their roles are described correctly. The experimental tools (optogenetics, FRET) are standard and appropriate for the question. The link between cortical tension $\\tau$, adhesion energy $w$, and interfacial tension $\\gamma$ is a central concept in the biophysics of tissues.\n\nThe problem is well-posed. It presents a clear objective: to distinguish between two hypotheses using a specific experimental system. The question is structured to have a single best answer among the options, based on deductive reasoning from the provided first principles.\n\nThe problem is objective and self-contained. It uses precise scientific language and provides the necessary conceptual framework. No essential information required for logical deduction is missing. The premise is not based on any factual inaccuracies or scientific misconceptions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formulated problem in biophysics and cell biology that can be addressed through logical deduction based on established principles. The solution will proceed.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe central physical quantity is the interfacial tension, $\\gamma_{ij}$, at the interface between a cell of type $i$ and a cell of type $j$. Based on the foundational facts provided, this tension can be modeled as:\n$$ \\gamma_{ij} \\approx \\tau_i + \\tau_j - w_{ij} $$\nwhere $\\tau_i$ and $\\tau_j$ are the cortical tensions of the respective cells and $w_{ij}$ is the work of adhesion per unit area (or length in a $2$D view) at the interface.\n\nThe DAH posits that sorting is driven by differences in $w_{ij}$, while the DITH posits it is driven by differences in $\\tau_i$. The experimental setup is designed to perturb $\\tau_X$ specifically, while keeping $\\tau_Y$ and all $w_{ij}$ values constant on the short time scales of interest. Since both cell types express E-cadherin at equal levels, we can assume $w_{XX} \\approx w_{YY} \\approx w_{XY}$ before any long-term adaptive changes.\n\nThe experiment involves activating RhoA in type $X$ cells, which causes an acute increase in their cortical tension. Let the initial tension be $\\tau_X$ and the elevated tension be $\\tau_X'$, where $\\tau_X'  \\tau_X$. This perturbation leads to changes in the interfacial tensions involving type $X$ cells:\n- Homotypic $X:X$ tension: $\\gamma_{XX} = 2\\tau_X - w_{XX}$ increases to $\\gamma_{XX}' = 2\\tau_X' - w_{XX}$.\n- Heterotypic $X:Y$ tension: $\\gamma_{XY} = \\tau_X + \\tau_Y - w_{XY}$ increases to $\\gamma_{XY}' = \\tau_X' + \\tau_Y - w_{XY}$.\n- Homotypic $Y:Y$ tension: $\\gamma_{YY} = 2\\tau_Y - w_{YY}$ remains unchanged.\n\nAccording to the DITH, these acute changes in tension must have immediate, observable mechanical consequences that drive sorting. We analyze these consequences:\n\n1.  **Contact Angles and Boundary Curvature**: At a stable three-cell vertex, the interfacial tension vectors must sum to zero. The increase in $\\tau_X$ means that the cortex of cell $X$ pulls more strongly on its boundaries and on any vertices it is part of. This increased contractile force will cause cell $X$ to attempt to minimize its perimeter, leading to a sharpening (decrease) of the contact angle measured inside cell $X$, denoted $\\theta_X$. Furthermore, the entire tissue of $X$ cells now has a higher effective surface tension ($\\gamma_{XX}'$) than the $Y$ cell tissue ($\\gamma_{YY}$). A fluid with higher surface tension tends to minimize its surface area to reduce free energy. Thus, an aggregate of $X$ cells will tend to round up. At an $X:Y$ interface, this causes the boundary to deform such that it is concave when viewed from the $X$ domain, i.e., it bulges into the $X$ domain. The curvature, $\\kappa$, towards the $X$ domain increases.\n\n2.  **Molecular-Scale Forces**: The increase in cortical tension is transmitted through the cytoskeleton to the cadherin adhesion complexes at cell-cell junctions. This increases the mechanical load on the trans-dimers of E-cadherin. A Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) biosensor built into the cadherin molecule is designed to report on this tension. Increased tension pulls the FRET donor and acceptor fluorophores apart, which leads to a decrease in FRET efficiency.\n\n3.  **Adhesion Complex Composition**: The primary DITH mechanism is purely mechanical. On the rapid time scale of seconds to a minute, one does not expect significant changes in the amount of protein, such as E-cadherin, recruited to the junction. Therefore, the fluorescence intensity of tagged E-cadherin at the junction, a proxy for bond number, should remain relatively constant during the initial mechanical response.\n\n4.  **Sorting Dynamics**: If differential tension is the driving force for sorting, then artificially increasing this differential (by increasing $\\tau_X$) should increase the rate of sorting. A transient optogenetic perturbation should lead to acceleration of sorting only during the light-on phase, with the process slowing or halting during the light-off phase.\n\nA decisive experiment would therefore apply a transient perturbation of $\\tau_X$ and observe the immediate mechanical and molecular sequelae predicted above.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Apply localized blue-light pulses ($\\sim$ spot diameter  $10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) restricted to $X$:$Y$ boundaries to transiently activate RhoA in type $X$ cells ($30$ s on/$90$ s off for $10$ cycles). Quantify, in real time, heterotypic doublet contact angles on each side ($\\theta_X$ and $\\theta_Y$), boundary curvature $\\,\\kappa\\,$ at $X$:$Y$ interfaces, E-cadherin Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) efficiency as a proxy for molecular load across cadherin bonds, and E-cadherin cluster intensity as a proxy for bond number. Observe within $5$–$10$ s of each light pulse a reversible decrease in $\\theta_X$ (the higher-tension $X$ side sharpens) and a concomitant deflection of the $X$:$Y$ boundary into the $X$ domain (increased $\\kappa$ toward $X$), with a rapid drop in E-cadherin FRET efficiency at $X$:$Y$ contacts (consistent with increased force per bond) but no change in E-cadherin cluster intensity on these time scales; all changes relax within $60$ s after light off. Sorting accelerates only during illumination and halts between pulses.**\n\n- **Analysis**: The experimental paradigm (transient, localized pulses) is ideal for isolating rapid mechanical effects from slower adaptive responses. The measured quantities (angles, curvature, FRET, intensity) are precisely the correct ones. The observed outcomes are all in exact accordance with the predictions derived from the DITH:\n    - Decrease in $\\theta_X$ (sharpening): Correct.\n    - Increased $\\kappa$ toward $X$ (boundary moves into $X$ domain): Correct.\n    - Drop in FRET efficiency (increased force): Correct.\n    - No change in E-cadherin intensity (no immediate change in adhesion): Correct, this isolates tension as the primary variable.\n    - Reversibility and correlation with sorting rate: Correct, establishing causality.\n- **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**B. Illuminate the entire aggregate uniformly for $30$ min to activate RhoA in type $X$ cells, then quantify changes over $2$ h in total E-cadherin intensity at $X$:$Y$ contacts and global sorting index. Observe increased E-cadherin accumulation and a slow, monotonic drift of the boundary position over hours, with no immediate changes in contact angles or boundary curvature during the first $5$ min.**\n\n- **Analysis**: The long timescale of this experiment ($30\\,\\mathrm{min}$ stimulus, $2\\,\\mathrm{h}$ observation) is inappropriate for testing a hypothesis about rapid mechanical force generation. It conflates immediate effects with long-term cellular adaptation. The observation of \"no immediate changes in contact angles or boundary curvature\" directly contradicts the DITH. The observation of \"increased E-cadherin accumulation\" points towards an adhesion-based mechanism (DAH) or a secondary feedback, not the primary DITH effect.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**C. Apply localized blue-light pulses to type $X$ cells at $X$:$Y$ boundaries ($30$ s on/$90$ s off). Quantify doublet contact angles and contact area. Observe an immediate increase in $X$:$Y$ contact area and an increase in $\\theta_X$ (the $X$ side flattens), together with an increase in E-cadherin FRET efficiency (consistent with decreased force per bond), all of which persist for $ 10$ min after light off.**\n\n- **Analysis**: Every major observation described is the opposite of the DITH prediction. Increased $\\tau_X$ should cause contraction, *decreasing* contact area, *decreasing* $\\theta_X$, and *decreasing* FRET efficiency. The stated outcomes (increased contact area, increased $\\theta_X$, increased FRET) would suggest a *decrease* in tension or an *increase* in adhesion. Therefore, this result would falsify DITH as the explanation.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. Apply rapid global blue-light pulses ($10$ s on/$10$ s off for $30$ min) and quantify a sorting rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{sort}}$. Repeat after chelating extracellular calcium with Ethylene Glycol Tetraacetic Acid (EGTA) to $0.2$ mM to reduce cadherin binding. Observe that $k_{\\mathrm{sort}}$ increases only when EGTA is present, and infer that adhesion differences dominate because sorting is faster when adhesion is reduced.**\n\n- **Analysis**: This option introduces a pharmacological confounder, EGTA, which reduces all cadherin-based adhesion. Reducing adhesion ($w_{ij}$) increases all interfacial tensions ($\\gamma_{ij}$), which could non-specifically increase the rate of rearrangement regardless of the underlying sorting mechanism. The inference that \"adhesion differences dominate because sorting is faster when adhesion is reduced\" is a non-sequitur and logically flawed. The experiment is not designed to cleanly distinguish DITH from DAH; rather, it conflates multiple effects. The key advantage of the optogenetic tool—the ability to perturb tension *alone*—is not properly exploited to make a decisive conclusion.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option A is the only one that proposes a scientifically sound experiment with a set of outcomes that serves as a unique and definitive signature for sorting driven by differential cortical tension.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2623653"}]}
