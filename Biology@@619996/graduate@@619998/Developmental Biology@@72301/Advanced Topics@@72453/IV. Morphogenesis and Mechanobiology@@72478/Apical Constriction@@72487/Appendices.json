Non-Muscle Myosin class II (NMII) generates force when its regulatory light chain is phosphorylated. Phosphorylation is catalyzed by kinases such as Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase and Myosin Light Chain Kinase, whereas Myosin Light Chain Phosphatase (MLCP) removes the phosphate. Pulses of apical contraction arise from a mechanochemical network in which myosin activation is transient and is followed by relaxation that depends on turnover of phosphorylated myosin and cortical actin. Consider a pharmacological perturbation that selectively inhibits MLCP activity in otherwise unaltered epithelia, without directly affecting the kinases or actin polymerization nucleators, and assume cell-cell adhesion and tissue-scale load remain unchanged. Define the amplitude of a pulse as the transient increase in contractile tension at the apical cortex during a pulse relative to its immediately preceding baseline, and define frequency as the number of such pulses per unit time once the system reaches a quasi-steady cyclic regime.

The regulation of non-muscle myosin II activity by the opposition of kinases and phosphatases is a fundamental, textbook-level mechanism. Pulsatile contractility is a known phenomenon in developmental processes like dorsal closure in *Drosophila* and neural tube formation in vertebrates. The components and their interactions are factually correct.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly formulated. It defines a system, a specific perturbation (inhibition of MLCP), and the variables to be predicted (amplitude and frequency). The inclusion of simplifying assumptions (e.g., no direct effect on kinases) creates a self-contained and solvable problem, focusing the analysis on the direct consequences of the perturbation. A unique, causal conclusion can be derived.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical and unambiguous. The definitions for 'amplitude' and 'frequency' are precise and allow for a non-subjective analysis.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\nThe problem requires an analysis of a mechanochemical oscillator governed by the phosphorylation state of myosin. We must examine the core regulatory circuit.\n\nLet $[pMRLC]$ be the concentration of the phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain, which dictates the active, force-generating state of NMII. The contractile tension, $\\tau$, is directly proportional to this concentration: $\\tau \\propto [pMRLC]$.\n\nThe dynamics of $[pMRLC]$ are controlled by the competing activities of kinases and phosphatases. We can represent this relationship with a simplified kinetic model:\n$$ \\frac{d[pMRLC]}{dt} = R_{phos} - R_{dephos} $$\nwhere $R_{phos}$ is the rate of phosphorylation catalyzed by kinases and $R_{dephos}$ is the rate of dephosphorylation catalyzed by MLCP. The rates are functions of kinase activity, phosphatase activity, and substrate concentrations. Specifically, $R_{dephos}$ is proportional to the activity of MLCP and the concentration of its substrate, $[pMRLC]$.\n\nThe perturbation is a selective inhibition of MLCP activity. This directly reduces the rate of dephosphorylation, $R_{dephos}$, for any given level of $[pMRLC]$.\n\n**1. Effect on Amplitude**\n\nAmplitude is defined as the peak contractile tension achieved during a pulse. This corresponds to the peak concentration of $[pMRLC]_{peak}$. A pulse is initiated by a transient increase in kinase activity, which drives up $[pMRLC]$. This accumulation is opposed by the dephosphorylation activity of MLCP.\n\nWhen MLCP is inhibited, the opposing force of dephosphorylation is weaker. For the same transient burst of kinase activity, the net rate of accumulation of $[pMRLC]$ will be higher. Consequently, the concentration of active myosin will reach a greater maximum value before the kinase signal subsides and dephosphorylation begins to dominate.\n\nMathematically, with a lower rate constant for the dephosphorylation reaction, the dynamic system will reach a higher peak $[pMRLC]$ for a given activating input. Since tension $\\tau \\propto [pMRLC]$, a higher peak concentration of active myosin results directly in a higher peak tension.\n\nTherefore, the inhibition of MLCP leads to an **increase in the amplitude** of contraction pulses.\n\n**2. Effect on Frequency**\n\nFrequency, $f$, is the reciprocal of the period of a single oscillation cycle, $T_{cycle}$. The problem states that a cycle involves activation followed by relaxation, and that relaxation is necessary to reset the oscillator for the next pulse. Relaxation is the process of reducing cortical tension back to a baseline level. This requires the deactivation of myosin, which is accomplished by the dephosphorylation of $pMRLC$ by MLCP.\n\nThe duration of the relaxation phase, $T_{relax}$, is determined by the rate at which $[pMRLC]$ is cleared from the cortex. This rate is fundamentally limited by the activity of MLCP.\n\nBy inhibiting MLCP, we reduce the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme responsible for myosin deactivation. The process of dephosphorylating $pMRLC$ from its peak level back down to the baseline threshold for initiating a new pulse will take a significantly longer time.\n\nThis directly translates to an increase in the duration of the relaxation phase, $T_{relax}$. The total period of the cycle is the sum of the contraction and relaxation phases, $T_{cycle} = T_{contract} + T_{relax}$. An increase in $T_{relax}$ necessarily leads to an increase in the total period, $T_{cycle}$.\n\nSince frequency is inversely proportional to the period ($f = 1/T_{cycle}$), a longer period implies a **decrease in the frequency** of the pulses.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation:**\n- Amplitude of contractile tension **increases**.\n- Frequency of contractile pulses **decreases**.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n- **A. Amplitude increases and frequency decreases.** This option is fully consistent with our mechanistic derivation. The reduced phosphatase activity allows for a higher peak of myosin phosphorylation (higher amplitude) but slows down the necessary relaxation phase, thus lengthening the cycle period (lower frequency). **Correct**.\n\n- **B. Amplitude decreases and frequency increases.** This is incorrect. It presents the exact opposite of the derived effects for both amplitude and frequency.\n\n- **C. Amplitude increases and frequency increases.** This is incorrect. While it correctly predicts the effect on amplitude, it incorrectly predicts the effect on frequency. A slower relaxation process cannot lead to more frequent events.\n\n- **D. Amplitude decreases and frequency decreases.** This is incorrect. It incorrectly predicts the effect on amplitude. Tension cannot decrease when the enzyme responsible for inactivating the force-generating motor is inhibited.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2620240"}, {"introduction": "Apical constriction generates the contractile forces that drive tissue remodeling, but how these forces sculpt an epithelium depends critically on the tissue's material properties and mechanical environment.

Consider a rectangular strip of the epithelium of length $L$ (in the $x$-direction, the future fold axis) and width $W$ (in the $y$-direction, the lateral extent). Apical constriction generates a uniform, active, compressive in-plane resultant $N$ (units: force per unit length) along $x$, effectively loading the strip axially.

The parameters and boundary conditions are clearly defined, and the task is to derive a specific ratio based on a simplified, yet physically meaningful, model of plate buckling. All essential information is provided. The problem is therefore valid, and I shall proceed to its solution.\n\nThe central task is to determine the critical compressive in-plane resultant $N_{\\mathrm{cr}}$ for a rectangular plate strip under two different lateral boundary conditions. The problem guides us to treat the plate as an effective one-dimensional member whose buckling is governed by the Euler instability criterion. The critical load for a pinned-pinned column of length $L$ with flexural rigidity $EI$ is $P_{\\mathrm{cr}} = \\frac{\\pi^{2} EI}{L^{2}}$ for the first buckling mode. For the plate strip of width $W$, the total compressive force is $P = NW$, and its effective flexural rigidity can be written as $(EI)_{\\mathrm{eff}} = D_{\\mathrm{eff}} W$, where $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is the effective bending rigidity per unit width. The Euler criterion for the plate is then:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{cr}} W = \\frac{\\pi^{2} (D_{\\mathrm{eff}} W)}{L^{2}} \\implies N_{\\mathrm{cr}} = \\frac{\\pi^{2} D_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{L^{2}}\n$$\nOur task reduces to finding the effective bending rigidity $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for each of the two lateral boundary conditions. This property describes the plate's resistance to bending along the $x$-axis and is defined by the ratio of the bending moment per unit width, $M_x$, to the corresponding curvature, $\\kappa_x$. The lateral boundary conditions modify this relationship by controlling the Poisson's effect, specifically the induced transverse curvature $\\kappa_y$.\n\nWe begin with the foundational moment-curvature relations for an isotropic Kirchhoff-Love plate, assuming zero twist curvature ($\\kappa_{xy} = 0$, leading to $M_{xy}=0$):\n$$\nM_x = -D (\\kappa_x + \\nu \\kappa_y)\n$$\n$$\nM_y = -D (\\kappa_y + \\nu \\kappa_x)\n$$\nHere, $D = \\frac{E h^{3}}{12(1-\\nu^{2})}$ is the plate's bending rigidity, $\\kappa_x = -\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2}$ and $\\kappa_y = -\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial y^2}$ are the principal curvatures for a transverse displacement field $w(x, y)$, and $\\nu$ is the Poisson's ratio. The problem asks for the response to a \"uniaxial bending mode along $x$\", which we interpret as a state where the primary deformation is a curvature $\\kappa_x$.\n\nCase 1: Free Lateral Edges\nThe lateral edges at $y=0$ and $y=W$ are free, meaning there is zero bending moment ($M_y=0$) and zero transverse shear force ($V_y=0$) along these edges. The problem states that the plate can develop an anticlastic transverse curvature to enforce this condition. For a strip that is not excessively wide, it is a reasonable idealization to assume that the transverse moment $M_y$ is approximately zero across the entire width $W$.\nSetting $M_y=0$ in the second moment-curvature relation gives:\n$$\n-D (\\kappa_y + \\nu \\kappa_x) = 0 \\implies \\kappa_y = -\\nu \\kappa_x\n$$\nThis relation describes the anticlastic curvature that develops freely in response to the primary curvature $\\kappa_x$. Substituting this expression for $\\kappa_y$ back into the equation for $M_x$:\n$$\nM_x = -D (\\kappa_x + \\nu (-\\nu \\kappa_x)) = -D (\\kappa_x - \\nu^2 \\kappa_x) = -D (1-\\nu^2) \\kappa_x\n$$\nThe effective bending rigidity per unit width for the free-edge case is the ratio of the required moment to the imposed curvature:\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{(free)}} = -\\frac{M_x}{\\kappa_x} = D(1-\\nu^2)\n$$\nUsing the definition of $D$, this simplifies to $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{(free)}} = \\frac{E h^{3}}{12}$, which is the bending rigidity of a simple beam of unit width, where lateral contraction is unrestricted. The critical compressive resultant is:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{cr}}^{\\mathrm{(free)}} = \\frac{\\pi^{2} D_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{(free)}}}{L^{2}} = \\frac{\\pi^{2} D(1-\\nu^2)}{L^{2}}\n$$\n\nCase 2: Clamped Lateral Edges\nThe lateral edges at $y=0$ and $y=W$ are clamped, meaning zero transverse displacement ($w=0$) and zero rotation ($\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}=0$) at the boundaries. These constraints prevent the plate from deforming in the transverse ($y$) direction. In the idealized limit of a wide plate or for a mode where transverse deformation is suppressed, this corresponds to a state of plane strain bending, where the transverse curvature is zero everywhere: $\\kappa_y = 0$. This condition implies that a transverse bending moment, $M_y$, must be generated and supported by the clamps to prevent the natural anticlastic curvature from forming.\nWith $\\kappa_y=0$, the moment-curvature relation for $M_x$ becomes:\n$$\nM_x = -D (\\kappa_x + \\nu \\cdot 0) = -D \\kappa_x\n$$\nThe effective bending rigidity per unit width for the clamped-edge case is therefore:\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{(clamped)}} = -\\frac{M_x}{\\kappa_x} = D\n$$\nThe critical compressive resultant for this case is:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{cr}}^{\\mathrm{(clamped)}} = \\frac{\\pi^{2} D_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{(clamped)}}}{L^{2}} = \\frac{\\pi^{2} D}{L^{2}}\n$$\nPhysically, preventing the anticlastic curvature makes the plate stiffer to bending along the $x$-axis, as evidenced by $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{(clamped)}} > D_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{(free)}}$ (since $0 \\leq \\nu < 0.5$ for most materials, so $1-\\nu^2 < 1$).\n\nFinally, we compute the required ratio $R$:\n$$\nR \\equiv \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{cr}}^{\\mathrm{(clamped)}}}{N_{\\mathrm{cr}}^{\\mathrm{(free)}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi^{2} D}{L^{2}}}{\\frac{\\pi^{2} D(1-\\nu^2)}{L^{2}}}\n$$\nThe terms $\\pi^2$, $D$, and $L^2$ cancel, yielding the final expression for the ratio, which depends only on the Poisson's ratio $\\nu$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{1}{1-\\nu^2}\n$$\nThis result quantifies the stiffening effect of the lateral clamping, which suppresses the Poisson's effect in bending.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{1-\\nu^{2}}}$$", "id": "2620204"}, {"introduction": "To build a predictive understanding of complex biological systems, we must learn to translate qualitative pathway diagrams into quantitative mathematical models.

We shall proceed directly to the derivation and solution.\n\n### Task A: Derivation of the Coupled ODE System\n\nThe dynamics of the system are governed by fundamental principles of biochemical kinetics.\n\nThe rate of change of the active RhoA fraction, $R(t)$, is determined by the balance between activation and inactivation.\nThe activation process, driven by GEFs, converts inactive RhoA, with fraction $1 - R(t)$, to active RhoA at a rate proportional to this inactive pool. The rate of increase of $R(t)$ due to activation is thus $k_{\\text{on}}(1 - R(t))$.\nThe inactivation process, driven by GAPs, converts active RhoA back to its inactive state. This contributes to a decrease in $R(t)$ at a rate proportional to the active fraction, giving a term $-k_{\\text{off}}R(t)$.\nCombining these terms gives the ordinary differential equation for $R(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}}(1 - R(t)) - k_{\\text{off}}R(t) $$\nThis can be rearranged into the standard form of a linear first-order ODE:\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dt} + (k_{\\text{on}} + k_{\\text{off}})R(t) = k_{\\text{on}} $$\n\nThe dimensionless myosin activation level, $M(t)$, is linearly driven by the active RhoA fraction, $R(t)$, with a gain of $k_m$. This corresponds to a production term $k_m R(t)$. Myosin activation also relaxes, or decays, with a rate constant $\\delta_m$, contributing a term $-\\delta_m M(t)$.

The integration becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(M(t) e^{\\delta_m t}\\right) = k_m R^* e^{\\delta_m t} + k_m (R_0 - R^*) $$\n$$ M(t) e^{\\delta_m t} = \\frac{k_m R^*}{\\delta_m} e^{\\delta_m t} + k_m (R_0 - R^*) t + C_3 $$\nGeneral solution:\n$$ M(t) = \\frac{k_m R^*}{\\delta_m} + k_m (R_0 - R^*) t e^{-\\delta_m t} + C_3 e^{-\\delta_m t} $$\nAs before, $M^* = \\frac{k_m R^*}{\\delta_m}$. Applying $M(0) = M_0$:\n$$ M_0 = M^* + 0 + C_3 \\implies C_3 = M_0 - M^* $$\nThe particular solution is:\n$$ M(t) = M^* + (M_0 - M^*) e^{-\\delta_m t} + k_m (R_0 - R^*) t e^{-\\delta_m t} $$\n\n**Steady States:**\nThe steady-state values $(R^*, M^*)$ are obtained by setting the time derivatives to zero, assuming the required rate constants ($k_{\\text{tot}}$ and $\\delta_m$) are positive.\n$$ 0 = k_{\\text{on}} - (k_{\\text{on}} + k_{\\text{off}})R^* \\implies R^* = \\frac{k_{\\text{on}}}{k_{\\text{on}} + k_{\\text{off}}} $$\n$$ 0 = k_m R^* - \\delta_m M^* \\implies M^* = \\frac{k_m}{\\delta_m} R^* = \\frac{k_m}{\\delta_m} \\frac{k_{\\text{on}}}{k_{\\text{on}} + k_{\\text{off}}} $$\nThese expressions are valid for all test cases provided.\n\n### Task C: Implementation\n\nThe analytical solutions derived are implemented in a program. For each parameter set, the program first calculates the steady states $R^*$ and $M^*$. Then, it determines whether the system is resonant ($\\delta_m = k_{\\text{on}} + k_{\\text{off}}$) or not, and applies the corresponding analytical formula to compute $R(t_{\\text{end}})$ and $M(t_{\\text{end}})$.
