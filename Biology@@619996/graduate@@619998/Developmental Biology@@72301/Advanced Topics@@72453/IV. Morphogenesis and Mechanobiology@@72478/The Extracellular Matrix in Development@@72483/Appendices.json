The problem is scientifically grounded and well-posed. We shall proceed with the solution using fundamental principles of stereology for two-phase porous media.\n\nFirst, we define the parameters provided. The tissue is modeled as a two-phase system consisting of collagen type I fibrils (the solid phase) and an interstitial void space (the pore phase).\nThe volume fraction of the collagen fibrils is given as $V_f = 0.02$.\nThe volume fraction of the void phase, $V_v$, is therefore $V_v = 1 - V_f$.\nThe collagen fibrils are idealized as straight, randomly oriented, non-overlapping circular cylinders of uniform diameter, $d = 100 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nThe objective is to find the mean void chord length, denoted as $\\bar{\\ell}_v$. The mean chord length of a phase in a multiphase material is a fundamental stereological parameter. For any isotropic two-phase structure, the mean chord length of a phase $i$ is related to its volume fraction $V_i$ and the interfacial surface area per unit volume, $S_V$, by the relation:\n$$\n\\bar{\\ell}_i = \\frac{4 V_i}{S_V}\n$$\nFor the void phase, this becomes:\n$$\n\\bar{\\ell}_v = \\frac{4 V_v}{S_V} = \\frac{4 (1 - V_f)}{S_V}\n$$\nTo solve for $\\bar{\\ell}_v$, we must first determine an expression for $S_V$ in terms of the given parameters, $V_f$ and $d$. $S_V$ represents the total surface area of the collagen fibrils contained within a unit volume of tissue.\n\nLet $L_V$ be the total length of fibrils per unit volume of tissue. The volume of a single fibril is its cross-sectional area, $A = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}$, multiplied by its length. Thus, the total volume of fibrils per unit volume of tissue, which is by definition the volume fraction $V_f$, is given by:\n$$\nV_f = L_V \\cdot A = L_V \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}\n$$\nSimilarly, the surface area of a single fibril (neglecting the end caps, as is standard for long aspect-ratio fibers) is its perimeter, $P = \\pi d$, multiplied by its length. The total surface area of fibrils per unit volume of tissue, $S_V$, is:\n$$\nS_V = L_V \\cdot P = L_V (\\pi d)\n$$\nWe now have a system of two equations with the unknown $L_V$. We can eliminate $L_V$ to relate $S_V$ directly to $V_f$ and $d$. From the second equation, we have $L_V = \\frac{S_V}{\\pi d}$. Substituting this into the first equation yields:\n$$\nV_f = \\left(\\frac{S_V}{\\pi d}\\right) \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4} = \\frac{S_V d}{4}\n$$\nSolving for $S_V$, we find the interfacial area per unit volume for a random network of long fibers:\n$$\nS_V = \\frac{4 V_f}{d}\n$$\nThis is a standard result in the stereology of fiber systems. Now we can substitute this expression for $S_V$ back into our equation for the mean void chord length $\\bar{\\ell}_v$:\n$$\n\\bar{\\ell}_v = \\frac{4 (1 - V_f)}{S_V} = \\frac{4 (1 - V_f)}{\\left(\\frac{4 V_f}{d}\\right)}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the final derived relationship:\n$$\n\\bar{\\ell}_v = \\frac{d (1 - V_f)}{V_f}\n$$\nThis expression provides the mean void chord length in terms of the fibril diameter and fibril volume fraction.\n\nNext, we must evaluate this expression for the given parameters. The fibril diameter is $d = 100 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$. The problem asks for the result in micrometers, so we convert the units: $d = 100 \\ \\mathrm{nm} = 0.1 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$. The collagen volume fraction is $V_f = 0.02$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\n\\bar{\\ell}_v = \\frac{(0.1 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}) (1 - 0.02)}{0.02}\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{\\ell}_v = \\frac{(0.1 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}) (0.98)}{0.02} = \\frac{0.098}{0.02} \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 4.9 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $4.9$, which has two significant figures. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $4.90$. Thus, the mean pore size is $\\bar{\\ell}_v = 4.90 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nFinally, we briefly interpret this result in the context of cell protrusions during development. The calculated mean pore size is $\\bar{\\ell}_v = 4.90 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$. Cellular protrusions such as filopodia, which are essential for environmental sensing, typically have diameters on the order of $0.1$ to $0.3 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$. Since this dimension is an order of magnitude smaller than the mean pore size, the ECM's steric structure does not pose a significant barrier to the extension of these fine protrusions. The cell can easily explore its microenvironment. However, the migration of the entire cell body, which has a diameter of approximately $5$ to $20 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$ for a mesenchymal cell, would be sterically constrained. A mean pore size of $4.90 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$ would require the cell to undergo significant deformation, particularly of its nucleus, to squeeze through the matrix. Therefore, this ECM geometry is permissive for local sensing but restrictive for bulk cell translocation, which may necessitate other mechanisms such as matrix remodeling by proteases.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4.90}\n$$", "id": "2680669"}, {"introduction": "Beyond its structure, the ECM's mechanical stiffness is a key instructive cue for developing cells, influencing processes from differentiation to morphogenesis.

We will proceed to the solution.\n\nThe theoretical foundation for this problem is the statistical mechanics of ideal polymer networks, specifically the theory of rubber elasticity. For a network of Gaussian chains undergoing small deformations, the elastic response is primarily entropic. The free energy change is related to the reduction in configurational entropy of the polymer strands upon stretching. This leads to a direct relationship between the small-strain shear modulus $G$, the number density of elastically active network strands $n$ (in units of number per volume), and the absolute temperature $T$. The fundamental equation is:\n$$G = n k_{B} T$$\nwhere $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe problem provides the concentration of elastically active strands, $\\nu$, in molar units, specifically $\\nu = 50\\ \\mathrm{mM}$.
