The solution is derived from first principles of static equilibrium and viscous dynamics.\n\nFirst, we analyze the condition of quasi-static mechanical equilibrium at the vertex prior to ablation, which occurs at time $t<0$. The forces exerted by the three cables must sum to zero. The force balance equation is given as:\n$$T_1 \\mathbf{u}_1 + T_2 \\mathbf{u}_2 + T_3 \\mathbf{u}_3 = \\mathbf{0}$$\nwhere $T_i$ is the magnitude of the tension in cable $i$ and $\\mathbf{u}_i$ is the corresponding unit vector pointing away from the vertex.\n\nTo solve this vector equation for the unknown tensions $T_1$ and $T_2$, we establish a $2$-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system with the vertex at the origin $(0, 0)$. We can orient the system for simplicity without loss of generality. Let us align the unit vector $\\mathbf{u}_1$ with the positive x-axis. Thus, its components are:\n$$\\mathbf{u}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe angle between cables $1$ and $2$ is given as $\\alpha_3 = 90^{\\circ}$.

The angle of $\\mathbf{u}_3$ relative to the positive x-axis is therefore $90^{\\circ} + 150^{\\circ} = 240^{\\circ}$.

Assume small strains and small slopes so that Kirchhoff–Love plate theory applies, and that the neutral plane is at mid-thickness.\n\nApical constriction is modeled as an active, tangential contractile force generated by each cell at the apical surface. Along a line parallel to the furrow axis, cells are arranged with center-to-center spacing $a$, so that there are $1/a$ cells per unit length along the axis.

The system is in a state of static equilibrium where the active bending moment generated by cellular forces is exactly balanced by the passive elastic restoring moment of the deformed epithelial sheet. We will calculate these two moments per unit length along the axis of the furrow and then equate them.\n\nFirst, we determine the elastic restoring moment per unit length, which we denote as $M_{\\text{elastic}}$. The problem specifies that the epithelial sheet behaves as a thin plate. According to the Kirchhoff–Love theory of plates, the relationship between the bending moments per unit length ($M_x$, $M_y$) and the principal curvatures ($\\kappa_x$, $\\kappa_y$) is given by:\n$$ M_x = D (\\kappa_x + \\nu \\kappa_y) $$\n$$ M_y = D (\\kappa_y + \\nu \\kappa_x) $$\nwhere $D$ is the flexural rigidity of the plate.

We align our coordinate system such that the bending occurs about the $y$-axis (the axis of the furrow). Therefore, the curvature in the $x-z$ plane is $\\kappa_x = \\kappa = 1/R$, and the curvature in the $y-z$ plane is $\\kappa_y = 0$.\n\nThe relevant bending moment is the one that resists this curvature, which is $M_x$.Substituting the curvatures into the equation for $M_x$:\n$$ M_{\\text{elastic}} = M_x = D (\\kappa + \\nu \\cdot 0) = D\\kappa $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $D$ and $\\kappa$, the elastic moment per unit length is:\n$$ M_{\\text{elastic}} = \\frac{Eh^3}{12(1-\\nu^2)} \\frac{1}{R} $$\n\nNext, we determine the active bending moment per unit length, $M_{\\text{active}}$, generated by the apical contractile forces.\nThe cells are arranged with a spacing of $a$. Therefore, the number of cells per unit length along the furrow is $1/a$.\nEach cell exerts a contractile force $F_{\\text{cell}}$. The total contractile force per unit length of the furrow, $F_{\\text{length}}$, is the force per cell multiplied by the number of cells per unit length:\n$$ F_{\\text{length}} = F_{\\text{cell}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{a} = \\frac{F_{\\text{cell}}}{a} $$\nThis force is tangential and acts at the apical surface. The problem states that the neutral plane is at the mid-thickness of the sheet. The thickness of the sheet is $h$. The distance from the apical surface to the neutral plane is therefore $h/2$. This distance acts as the lever arm for the tangential force. The problem confirms this by specifying an \"effective lever arm equal to $h/2$\".\nThe active bending moment per unit length is the product of the force per unit length and the lever arm:\n$$ M_{\\text{active}} = F_{\\text{length}} \\cdot (\\text{lever arm}) = \\left(\\frac{F_{\\text{cell}}}{a}\\right) \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ M_{\\text{active}} = \\frac{F_{\\text{cell}}h}{2a} $$\n\nThe condition for equilibrium, as stated in the problem, is that the active moment balances the elastic moment:\n$$ M_{\\text{active}} = M_{\\text{elastic}} $$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for these moments:\n$$ \\frac{F_{\\text{cell}}h}{2a} = \\frac{Eh^3}{12(1-\\nu^2)R} $$\nWe must now solve this equation for the per-cell force, $F_{\\text{cell}}$.\n$$ F_{\\text{cell}} = \\frac{2a}{h} \\left( \\frac{Eh^3}{12(1-\\nu^2)R} \\right) $$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$ F_{\\text{cell}} = \\frac{2aEh^3}{12h(1-\\nu^2)R} $$\n$$ F_{\\text{cell}} = \\frac{aEh^2}{6(1-\\nu^2)R} $$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the minimal force per cell required to sustain the specified curvature.
