Use the following experimentally grounded principles as your starting point:\n\n- Near stall conditions, the force–velocity relation of a Myosin II minifilament is approximately linear: a bound minifilament under load exerts an average force $F(v)$ that depends on the relative sliding speed $v$ between actin and myosin according to $F(v) = F_{0}\\left(1 - \\frac{v}{v_{0}}\\right)$, where $F_{0}$ is the stall force and $v_{0}$ is the unloaded sliding speed.\n\n- In an active gel description, the contractile surface tension is the sum over force dipoles per unit area. If each bound minifilament produces an average contractile dipole moment $m_{d} = F(v)\\,d$ with effective arm length $d$, and the fraction of time a minifilament is bound is the duty ratio $p$, then the cortical surface tension $T$ is proportional to the areal density of minifilaments $\\rho_{A}$ as $T = \\rho_{A}\\,p\\,m_{d}$.\n\nA cell is characterized by the following parameters under control conditions: minifilament stall force $F_{0} = 35\\,\\mathrm{pN}$, unloaded speed $v_{0} = 0.4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, actin retrograde speed relative to myosin $v = 0.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ (assumed unaffected by the perturbation considered here), effective dipole arm $d = 0.12\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, areal density of minifilaments $\\rho_{A} = 1200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, and duty ratio $p_{0} = 0.12$.\n\nBlebbistatin treatment reduces the Myosin II duty ratio by $60\\%$ without altering $F_{0}$, $v_{0}$, $v$, $d$, or $\\rho_{A}$ on the timescale of measurement.\n\nUsing only the principles stated above, derive and compute the cortical surface tension after Blebbistatin treatment.

The use of linear error propagation for small fluctuations is a standard and valid technique in statistical physics. The model is a simplification, but it is a scientifically sound one for this level of analysis.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a complete set of equations and asks for the derivation of a specific quantity ($\\mathrm{CV}_\\theta$) based on these equations. The parameters for calculation are fully specified. A unique solution exists and is meaningful within the context of the model.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, mathematical language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\nThe verdict is that the problem is **valid**. It is a standard, albeit non-trivial, exercise in biophysical modeling and error analysis. The solution process may proceed.\n\nThe goal is to derive an expression for the coefficient of variation of the bend angle, $\\mathrm{CV}_\\theta$, based on the fluctuations of the system parameters.\n\nFirst, an explicit expression for the bend angle $\\theta$ in terms of all fluctuating parameters must be constructed.\nWe are given:\n1. $\\theta = \\kappa L$\n2. $\\kappa = M/B$\n3. $M = Th$\nCombining these gives $\\theta = \\frac{ThL}{B}$.\n\nThe active tension $T$ is proportional to several factors. Let $C$ be the constant of proportionality.\n$T = C \\rho_a \\rho_m f_s d \\phi$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{(C \\rho_a \\rho_m f_s d \\phi) h L}{B} $$\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $\\phi$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{C h L}{B} (\\rho_a \\rho_m f_s d) \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}} + k_{\\mathrm{off}}} \\right) $$\nThe parameters $C$ and $h$ are given as nonfluctuating constants.\n\nThe task requires the use of error propagation in logarithmic space. We therefore take the natural logarithm of the expression for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\ln \\theta = \\ln(C h) + \\ln \\rho_a + \\ln \\rho_m + \\ln f_s + \\ln d + \\ln L - \\ln B + \\ln k_{\\mathrm{on}} - \\ln(k_{\\mathrm{on}} + k_{\\mathrm{off}}) $$\nThe sensitivity of $\\ln \\theta$ with respect to the logarithm of a parameter $p_i$, denoted $S_i$, is defined as the partial derivative $S_i = \\frac{\\partial(\\ln \\theta)}{\\partial(\\ln p_i)}$. This is equivalent to $S_i = \\frac{p_i}{\\theta}\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial p_i}$. We compute this for each fluctuating parameter.\n\nFor parameters appearing as simple multiplicative factors ($\\rho_a, \\rho_m, f_s, d, L, B$):\n$S_{\\rho_a} = \\frac{\\partial(\\ln \\theta)}{\\partial(\\ln \\rho_a)} = 1$\n$S_{\\rho_m} = \\frac{\\partial(\\ln \\theta)}{\\partial(\\ln \\rho_m)} = 1$\n$S_{f_s} = \\frac{\\partial(\\ln \\theta)}{\\partial(\\ln f_s)} = 1$\n$S_d = \\frac{\\partial(\\ln \\theta)}{\\partial(\\ln d)} = 1$\n$S_L = \\frac{\\partial(\\ln \\theta)}{\\partial(\\ln L)} = 1$\n$S_B = \\frac{\\partial(\\ln \\theta)}{\\partial(\\ln B)} = -1$\n\nFor the kinetic rates, we use the chain rule: $S_{p_i} = p_i \\frac{\\partial(\\ln \\theta)}{\\partial p_i}$.\nFor $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$:\n$$ S_{k_{\\mathrm{on}}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_{\\mathrm{on}}} \\left( \\ln k_{\\mathrm{on}} - \\ln(k_{\\mathrm{on}} + k_{\\mathrm{off}}) \\right) = k_{\\mathrm{on}} \\left( \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}} - \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{on}} + k_{\\mathrm{off}}} \\right) = 1 - \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}} + k_{\\mathrm{off}}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}} + k_{\\mathrm{off}}} $$\nFor $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$:\n$$ S_{k_{\\mathrm{off}}} = k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_{\\mathrm{off}}} \\left( - \\ln(k_{\\mathrm{on}} + k_{\\mathrm{off}}) \\right) = k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\left( - \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{on}} + k_{\\mathrm{off}}} \\right) = - \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}} + k_{\\mathrm{off}}} $$\nIt is useful to express these sensitivities in terms of $\\phi = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}} + k_{\\mathrm{off}}}$. We have $1 - \\phi = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}} + k_{\\mathrm{off}}}$.\nThus, $S_{k_{\\mathrm{on}}} = 1 - \\phi$ and $S_{k_{\\mathrm{off}}} = -(1-\\phi) = \\phi - 1$.\n\nNow, we derive the expression for the squared coefficient of variation, $\\mathrm{CV}_\\theta^2$. For small, independent fluctuations, the variance of the logarithm of a function is given by the sum of the squared sensitivities weighted by the variance of the relative fluctuations of the parameters. The relative fluctuation $\\delta_i = (p_i - \\bar{p}_i)/\\bar{p}_i$ has variance $\\langle \\delta_i^2 \\rangle = \\mathrm{CV}_i^2$.\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\ln \\theta) = \\sum_i S_i^2 \\mathrm{Var}(\\ln p_i) \\approx \\sum_i S_i^2 \\mathrm{CV}_i^2 $$\nFor small fluctuations, we also have $\\mathrm{CV}_\\theta^2 \\approx \\mathrm{Var}(\\ln \\theta)$.\nTherefore:\n$$ \\mathrm{CV}_\\theta^2 = \\sum_i S_i^2 \\mathrm{CV}_i^2 $$\nSubstituting the sensitivities derived above:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CV}_\\theta^2 = S_{\\rho_a}^2 \\mathrm{CV}_{\\rho_a}^2 + S_{\\rho_m}^2 \\mathrm{CV}_{\\rho_m}^2 + S_{f_s}^2 \\mathrm{CV}_{f_s}^2 + S_d^2 \\mathrm{CV}_d^2 + S_L^2 \\mathrm{CV}_L^2 + S_B^2 \\mathrm{CV}_B^2 + S_{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}^2 \\mathrm{CV}_{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}^2 + S_{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}^2 \\mathrm{CV}_{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}^2\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{CV}_\\theta^2 = (1)^2 \\mathrm{CV}_{\\rho_a}^2 + (1)^2 \\mathrm{CV}_{\\rho_m}^2 + (1)^2 \\mathrm{CV}_{f_s}^2 + (1)^2 \\mathrm{CV}_d^2 + (1)^2 \\mathrm{CV}_L^2 + (-1)^2 \\mathrm{CV}_B^2 + (1-\\phi)^2 \\mathrm{CV}_{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}^2 + (\\phi-1)^2 \\mathrm{CV}_{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}^2\n$$\nSince $(\\phi-1)^2 = (1-\\phi)^2$, the expression simplifies:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CV}_\\theta^2 = \\mathrm{CV}_{\\rho_a}^2 + \\mathrm{CV}_{\\rho_m}^2 + \\mathrm{CV}_{f_s}^2 + \\mathrm{CV}_d^2 + \\mathrm{CV}_L^2 + \\mathrm{CV}_B^2 + (1-\\phi)^2 (\\mathrm{CV}_{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}^2 + \\mathrm{CV}_{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}^2)\n$$\nSubstituting $1-\\phi = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}} + k_{\\mathrm{off}}}$, we obtain the final expression to be implemented:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CV}_\\theta = \\sqrt{ \\mathrm{CV}_{\\rho_a}^2 + \\mathrm{CV}_{\\rho_m}^2 + \\mathrm{CV}_{f_s}^2 + \\mathrm{CV}_d^2 + \\mathrm{CV}_L^2 + \\mathrm{CV}_B^2 + \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}} + k_{\\mathrm{off}}} \\right)^2 (\\mathrm{CV}_{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}^2 + \\mathrm{CV}_{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}^2) }\n$$\nThis expression is dimensionless and depends on the mean values of $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ only through their ratio which determines the kinetic sensitivity factor, as dictated by the problem statement.
