The assumptions, such as constant thickness and no cell proliferation, are standard simplifications used to model this phenomenon over specific timescales. The problem is well-posed, objective, and provides a complete and consistent set of information to derive a unique solution. The connection between mass conservation and area conservation is explicitly justified by the premises of constant density and constant thickness. Thus, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be formulated.\n\nThe core principle for solving this problem is the conservation of mass. The problem states that the tissue can be modeled as a continuum with constant mass density $\\rho$ and constant thickness $h$. The total mass $M$ of the patch is the product of its density, volume $V$, which in turn is the product of its area $A$ and thickness $h$.\n\nThe initial mass of the patch is $M_0 = \\rho A_0 h$, where $A_0$ is the initial area.\nThe final mass of the patch is $M = \\rho A h$, where $A$ is the final area.\n\nThe problem states that mass is conserved, which means $M_0 = M$.\n$$\n\\rho A_0 h = \\rho A h\n$$\nSince $\\rho$ and $h$ are non-zero constants, we can divide both sides by $\\rho h$, which yields the principle of area conservation:\n$$\nA_0 = A\n$$\nThis conclusion is also stated directly in the problem: \"the in-plane velocity field is divergence-free and preserves area elements\".\n\nThe tissue patch is specified as rectangular.

It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, ill-posed, or trivial.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe process of a T1 transition is a thermally or, in this biological context, actively-driven process that must overcome an energy barrier. The rate of such a process, $k_{\\mathrm{T1}}$, can be described by an Arrhenius-like relation:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{T1}} \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{k_B T_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\\right)$$\nwhere $E_a$ is the activation energy barrier for the T1 transition, and $k_B T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ represents the energy scale of the \"active fluctuations\" that drive the system over this barrier. The problem states that the magnitude of these active fluctuations is unchanged, which means $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is a constant. Therefore, the change in $k_{\\mathrm{T1}}$ is determined entirely by the change in the activation energy barrier, $E_a$.\n\nThe energy barrier $E_a$ is determined by the balance of forces that promote and resist junctional remodeling.\n$1$. **Driving Forces**: The problem states that anisotropic actomyosin contractility drives the shrinkage of mediolateral (ML) junctions. This contractility generates tension on the junctions. A higher tension on a junction lowers the energy barrier for its collapse. The problem explicitly states that the level and planar polarity of actomyosin are unchanged. Thus, the active, anisotropic tensions that drive T1 transitions remain constant.\n\n$2$. **Resistive Forces (Stabilizing Factors)**: The problem defines the role of E-cadherin adhesion as to \"stabilize existing junctions against detachment\" by \"increas[ing] the work required to separate apposed membranes\". A T1 transition fundamentally requires the shrinkage of a junction to zero length, which is a form of membrane separation and topological rearrangement. The perturbation is a global increase in E-cadherin-mediated adhesion strength. According to the problem's own definition, this increased adhesion will make it more difficult to shrink any given junction. In terms of energy, the stabilization of junctions translates directly to an increase in the energy barrier, $E_a$, that must be surmounted to execute a T1 transition. Stronger adhesion makes the junctions \"stickier\" and more resistant to topological change.\n\n**Effect on $k_{\\mathrm{T1}}$**:\nSince the perturbation increases E-cadherin adhesion strength, the energy barrier $E_a$ for a T1 transition increases. With $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ held constant, the rate $k_{\\mathrm{T1}}$ will change as follows:\n$$E_a \\uparrow \\implies -\\frac{E_a}{k_B T_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\downarrow \\implies \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{k_B T_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\\right) \\downarrow \\implies k_{\\mathrm{T1}} \\text{ decreases.}$$\nThe rate of the elementary cell rearrangement events is reduced because the junctions are more stable and harder to break and reform.\n\n**Effect on $v_{\\mathrm{CE}}$**:\nConvergent extension is the macroscopic, tissue-scale deformation that emerges from the accumulation of microscopic cell intercalation events (the T1 transitions). The rate of anteroposterior tissue extension, $v_{\\mathrm{CE}}$, is directly proportional to the rate of productive T1 transitions (i.e., those that correctly shrink ML junctions and create new AP junctions). The anisotropy of actomyosin provides the bias that makes these T1s productive for extension, and this bias is stated to be unchanged. Since the overall rate of all T1 transitions, $k_{\\mathrm{T1}}$, decreases, the rate of productive T1 transitions must also decrease. Consequently, the macroscopic rate of tissue extension, $v_{\\mathrm{CE}}$, which is driven by these microscopic events, must also decrease.\n$$k_{\\mathrm{T1}} \\downarrow \\implies \\text{Rate of cell intercalation} \\downarrow \\implies v_{\\mathrm{CE}} \\text{ decreases.}$$\n\nIn summary, increasing adhesion stabilizes cell-cell junctions, making them more resistant to remodeling. This slows down the rate of T1 transitions ($k_{\\mathrm{T1}}$ decreases), which in turn slows down the macroscopic rate of tissue convergent extension ($v_{\\mathrm{CE}}$ decreases).\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n- **A. $k_{\\mathrm{T1}}$ decreases; $v_{\\mathrm{CE}}$ decreases.**\nThis aligns perfectly with our derivation. Increased adhesion raises the energy barrier for junctional remodeling, reducing the rate of T1 transitions ($k_{\\mathrm{T1}}$). The reduced rate of the underlying microscopic events leads to a reduced rate of the macroscopic tissue deformation ($v_{\\mathrm{CE}}$). This option is **Correct**.\n\n- **B. $k_{\\mathrm{T1}}$ decreases; $v_{\\mathrm{CE}}$ increases.**\nThis is logically inconsistent. Convergent extension is the direct physical result of cell intercalation events. If the rate of these events decreases, the overall rate of tissue extension cannot increase, assuming the geometric efficiency of the events is not somehow enhanced (which is not suggested). This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n- **C. $k_{\\mathrm{T1}}$ increases; $v_{\\mathrm{CE}}$ increases.**\nThis contradicts the fundamental role of adhesion as a stabilizing agent. Increased adhesion should inhibit, not promote, junctional remodeling. Therefore, $k_{\\mathrm{T1}}$ should decrease, not increase. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D. $k_{\\mathrm{T1}}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{CE}}$ are unchanged.**\nThis would imply that adhesion plays no role in the energy barrier for a T1 transition. This is explicitly contradicted by the problem statement, which asserts that adhesion \"stabilizes existing junctions\". Therefore, a change in adhesion strength must have an effect. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n- **E. $k_{\\mathrm{T1}}$ increases; $v_{\\mathrm{CE}}$ decreases.**\nThis option contains two contradictions. First, as explained for C, $k_{\\mathrm{T1}}$ should decrease. Second, as explained for B, an increase in the rate of the fundamental process ($k_{\\mathrm{T1}}$) cannot lead to a decrease in the macroscopic rate it drives ($v_{\\mathrm{CE}}$).

Data Representation and Preprocessing**\n\nThe state of the cell sheet at discrete time points $t_k$ is represented by a symmetric binary adjacency matrix $A_k$ of size $N \\times N$, where $N$ is the number of cells. An entry $A_k(i, j) = 1$ signifies that cells $i$ and $j$ are neighbors at time $t_k$, and $A_k(i, j) = 0$ otherwise. By convention, the diagonal entries $A_k(i, i)$ are zero. These matrices are constructed from the provided sets of unordered pairs of neighboring cells (edges). For each time point $t_k$, an $N \\times N$ matrix is initialized with zeros. For each edge $(u, v)$ in the given set, the entries corresponding to that pair, $A_k(u, v)$ and $A_k(v, u)$, are set to $1$.\n\n**2. Quantification of Cell Rearrangement Rate**\n\nA neighbor exchange event, or T1 transition, manifests as a change in the adjacency relationships between cells. Over a time interval $[t_k, t_{k+1}]$, the number of such changes is quantified by comparing the adjacency matrices $A_k$ and $A_{k+1}$.\n\nThe number of toggled unordered cell pairs, $\\text{toggles}_k$, is the count of pairs $(i, j)$ with $i < j$ for which the adjacency status has changed. This is computed by taking the element-wise difference between the two matrices, $D_k = A_{k+1} - A_k$, and summing the absolute values of the entries in the upper triangle:\n$$\n\\text{toggles}_k = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-2} \\sum_{j=i+1}^{N-1} |A_{k+1}(i, j) - A_k(i, j)|\n$$\nEach completed neighbor exchange event is assumed to rewire two edges (i.e., cause two toggles in the upper triangle, one connection lost and one gained). Thus, the estimated number of events $E_k$ in the interval is:\n$$\nE_k = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{toggles}_k\n$$\nThe rate of neighbor exchanges per cell per minute, $r_k$, is then calculated by normalizing $E_k$ by the number of cells $N$ and the duration of the interval $\\Delta t_k$ (in seconds), and converting to a per-minute basis by multiplying by $60$:\n$$\nr_k = \\frac{E_k}{N} \\cdot \\frac{60}{\\Delta t_k}\n$$\n\n**3. Quantification of Tissue Strain Rate**\n\nThe tissue strain rate, $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t)$, is defined in continuum mechanics as $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\frac{1}{L(t)} \\frac{dL}{dt}$, where $L(t)$ is the tissue length. Over a discrete interval $[t_k, t_{k+1}]$, this can be approximated by integrating the definition, which yields the logarithmic strain rate (or true strain rate):\n$$\n\\int_{t_k}^{t_{k+1}} \\dot{\\epsilon}(t) dt = \\int_{L(t_k)}^{L(t_{k+1})} \\frac{dL}{L} = \\ln(L(t_{k+1})) - \\ln(L(t_k))\n$$\nAssuming a constant strain rate $s_k$ over the interval of duration $\\Delta t_k$, we get $s_k \\cdot \\Delta t_k = \\ln(L_{k+1}) - \\ln(L_k)$. We solve for $s_k$ and convert to units of per minute:\n$$\ns_k = \\left(\\frac{\\ln L_{k+1} - \\ln L_k}{\\Delta t_k}\\right) \\cdot 60\n$$\n\n**4. Statistical Analysis and Summary**\n\nAfter computing the time series $\\{r_k\\}_{k=0}^{T-1}$ and $\\{s_k\\}_{k=0}^{T-1}$ for $T$ intervals, two summary statistics are calculated for each test case.\n\nFirst, the mean neighbor exchange rate, $\\bar{r}$, is calculated as the arithmetic average of the rates over all intervals:\n$$\n\\bar{r} = \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{k=0}^{T-1} r_k\n$$\nSecond, the relationship between the two series is quantified using the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). For two series $X = \\{x_i\\}$ and $Y = \\{y_i\\}$ of length $T$, the PCC is defined as:\n$$\n\\rho_{X,Y} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{T-1} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=0}^{T-1} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=0}^{T-1} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}}\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$ are the means of the respective series. If the variance of either series is zero (i.e., all elements are identical), the denominator becomes zero. As per the problem specification, the correlation coefficient is defined to be $0$ in such cases. Computationally, this will be handled using `numpy.corrcoef`, which correctly handles this scenario by producing `NaN` that can be mapped to $0$, or by explicitly checking for zero variance before the calculation.\n\nThe final implementation will process each test case from the provided suite, executing these steps to produce the required pair of values: $\\bar{r}$ and the PCC, rounded to six decimal places.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the convergent extension problem for the given test suite.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        # Test 1 (happy path, variable neighbor exchanges and positive strain)\n        {\n            \"N\": 4,\n            \"dt\": 60,\n            \"edges\": [\n                {(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)},\n                {(0, 1), (0, 2), (2, 3)},\n                {(0, 1), (0, 2), (2, 3)},\n                {(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)},\n            ],\n            \"lengths\": [100.0, 101.0, 101.5, 104.0],\n        },\n        # Test 2 (edge case with no rewiring and no strain)\n        {\n            \"N\": 4,\n            \"dt\": 60,\n            \"edges\": [\n                {(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0)},\n                {(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0)},\n                {(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0)},\n                {(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0)},\n            ],\n            \"lengths\": [120.0, 120.0, 120.0, 120.0],\n        },\n        # Test 3 (negative correlation scenario: high neighbor exchange when strain is negative)\n        {\n            \"N\": 4,\n            \"dt\": 60,\n            \"edges\": [\n                {(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)},\n                {(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3)},\n                {(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3)},\n                {(0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3)},\n            ],\n            \"lengths\": [150.0, 147.0, 147.0, 146.0],\n        },\n    ]\n\n    final_results = []\n\n    def build_adjacency_matrix(N, edges):\n        \"\"\"Constructs a symmetric binary adjacency matrix from an edge set.\"\"\"\n        adj_matrix = np.zeros((N, N), dtype=int)\n        for u, v in edges:\n            adj_matrix[u, v] = 1\n            adj_matrix[v, u] = 1\n        return adj_matrix\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N = case[\"N\"]\n        dt = case[\"dt\"]\n        edge_sets = case[\"edges\"]\n        lengths = case[\"lengths\"]\n\n        num_time_points = len(edge_sets)\n        adj_matrices = [build_adjacency_matrix(N, edges) for edges in edge_sets]\n\n        rates_r = []\n        strains_s = []\n\n        for k in range(num_time_points - 1):\n            A_k = adj_matrices[k]\n            A_k_plus_1 = adj_matrices[k+1]\n\n            # 1.
