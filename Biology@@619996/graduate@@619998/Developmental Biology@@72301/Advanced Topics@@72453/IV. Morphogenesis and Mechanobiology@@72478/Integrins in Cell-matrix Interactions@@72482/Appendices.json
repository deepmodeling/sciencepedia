Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) is used to report the conformational state: the bent, low-affinity state brings the labels closer (higher FRET efficiency), while the extended, high-affinity state separates the labels (lower FRET efficiency). \n\nYou perform donor-lifetime-based FRET measurements under two divalent cation conditions: magnesium ion ($\\text{Mg}^{2+}$) and manganese ion ($\\text{Mn}^{2+}$).

The information regarding the $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ condition is not strictly necessary for the primary calculation but is required for the requested interpretation, and does not render the problem overconstrained.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds from the assumption that the observed ensemble FRET efficiency, $E_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, is the linear combination of the efficiencies of the pure states, weighted by their fractional populations. Let $f_{\\mathrm{bent}}$ represent the fraction of the integrin population in the bent state and $f_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ represent the fraction in the extended state.\n\nFor a two-state system, the sum of the fractions must be unity:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{bent}} + f_{\\mathrm{ext}} = 1$$\nThis implies $f_{\\mathrm{bent}} = 1 - f_{\\mathrm{ext}}$.\n\nThe expression for the observed FRET efficiency is given by the population-weighted mean:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{obs}} = f_{\\mathrm{bent}} E_{\\mathrm{bent}} + f_{\\mathrm{ext}} E_{\\mathrm{ext}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $f_{\\mathrm{bent}}$ into this equation yields:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{obs}} = (1 - f_{\\mathrm{ext}}) E_{\\mathrm{bent}} + f_{\\mathrm{ext}} E_{\\mathrm{ext}}$$\nWe must now solve this equation for $f_{\\mathrm{ext}}$.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{obs}} = E_{\\mathrm{bent}} - f_{\\mathrm{ext}} E_{\\mathrm{bent}} + f_{\\mathrm{ext}} E_{\\mathrm{ext}}$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{obs}} - E_{\\mathrm{bent}} = f_{\\mathrm{ext}} (E_{\\mathrm{ext}} - E_{\\mathrm{bent}})$$\nIsolating $f_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ gives the general formula:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{ext}} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{obs}} - E_{\\mathrm{bent}}}{E_{\\mathrm{ext}} - E_{\\mathrm{bent}}}$$\nThe problem requires the calculation of $f_{\\mathrm{ext}}^{\\mathrm{Mn}}$, the fraction of extended integrins in the presence of $\\text{Mn}^{2+}$. We will substitute the values corresponding to the $\\text{Mn}^{2+}$ condition: $E_{\\mathrm{obs}}^{\\mathrm{Mn}} = 0.30$, $E_{\\mathrm{bent}} = 0.62$, and $E_{\\mathrm{ext}} = 0.18$.\n$$f_{\\mathrm{ext}}^{\\mathrm{Mn}} = \\frac{0.30 - 0.62}{0.18 - 0.62}$$\n$$f_{\\mathrm{ext}}^{\\mathrm{Mn}} = \\frac{-0.32}{-0.44} = \\frac{32}{44} = \\frac{8}{11}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives approximately $0.72727...$. Rounding to three significant figures, we obtain:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{ext}}^{\\mathrm{Mn}} \\approx 0.727$$\n\nFor the requested interpretation, we must first compute the fraction of extended integrins under the basal $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ condition, $f_{\\mathrm{ext}}^{\\mathrm{Mg}}$.

Upon addition of $\\text{Mn}^{2+}$, this fraction increases substantially to $72.7\\%$. This demonstrates that $\\text{Mn}^{2+}$ is a potent activator of this integrin, shifting the conformational equilibrium strongly from the predominantly bent, low-affinity state to the predominantly extended, high-affinity state.
