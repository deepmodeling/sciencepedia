It presents a clear, self-contained mathematical modeling exercise grounded in established concepts from developmental biology, namely positional information and morphallactic regeneration in Hydra. The problem is well-posed, relying on the standard methods of calculus of variations and algebraic manipulation, and is free of scientific inaccuracies, contradictions, or ambiguities. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. The first part requires the derivation of the positional value field, $p(x)$, in an intact organism. The second part requires the derivation of the renormalized field, $p_{\\mathrm{cut}}(x)$, in an excised fragment.\n\nFor the first part, we are tasked with finding the function $p(x)$ that minimizes the functional\n$$\n\\mathcal{J}[p] = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left(p''(x)\\right)^{2} \\, dx\n$$\nsubject to the boundary conditions $p(0)=0$ and $p(L)=1$. This is a problem in the calculus of variations. The Lagrangian is $F(x, p, p', p'') = (p''(x))^2$. Since the Lagrangian depends on the second derivative of $p(x)$, the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p} - \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p'}\\right) + \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p''}\\right) = 0\n$$\nFor our specific Lagrangian, we have $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p} = 0$, $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p'} = 0$, and $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p''} = 2p''(x)$. Substituting these into the Euler-Lagrange equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\\left(2p''(x)\\right) = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad p''''(x) = 0\n$$\nThis is a fourth-order ordinary differential equation. The general solution is a cubic polynomial of the form:\n$$\np(x) = C_1 x^3 + C_2 x^2 + C_3 x + C_4\n$$\nwhere $C_1$, $C_2$, $C_3$, and $C_4$ are constants of integration. To determine these constants, we need four boundary conditions. The problem explicitly provides two:\n1.  $p(0) = 0$\n2.  $p(L) = 1$\n\nThe remaining two conditions are the natural boundary conditions that arise from the variational principle when the derivatives of the function are not specified at the boundaries. The first variation of the functional $\\mathcal{J}[p]$ must be zero for any admissible variation $\\delta p(x)$. This requires that the boundary terms resulting from integration by parts vanish. For this functional, the boundary term is $[2p''(x)\\delta p'(x) - 2p'''(x)\\delta p(x)]_0^L$. Since $p(0)$ and $p(L)$ are fixed, any admissible variation must satisfy $\\delta p(0) = 0$ and $\\delta p(L) = 0$. The boundary term thus simplifies to $2p''(L)\\delta p'(L) - 2p''(0)\\delta p'(0)$. Since the variations $\\delta p'(0)$ and $\\delta p'(L)$ are arbitrary, their coefficients must be zero for this expression to vanish. This gives the two natural boundary conditions:\n3.  $p''(0) = 0$\n4.  $p''(L) = 0$\n\nWe now apply these four conditions to the general solution.\nFrom $p(0)=0$, we substitute $x=0$ into the general solution: $p(0) = C_4 = 0$.\nThe second derivative is $p''(x) = 6C_1 x + 2C_2$.\nFrom $p''(0)=0$, we have $p''(0) = 2C_2 = 0$, which implies $C_2=0$.\nFrom $p''(L)=0$, we have $p''(L) = 6C_1 L + 2C_2 = 0$. Since $C_2=0$ and $L>0$, this implies $6C_1 L = 0$, so $C_1=0$.\nWith $C_1=0$, $C_2=0$, and $C_4=0$, the solution simplifies to $p(x) = C_3 x$.\nFinally, we apply the condition $p(L)=1$: $p(L) = C_3 L = 1$, which gives $C_3 = \\frac{1}{L}$.\nThus, the function that minimizes the functional is:\n$$\np(x) = \\frac{x}{L}\n$$\nThis function is strictly increasing, as its derivative $p'(x) = 1/L$ is positive for $L>0$. Furthermore, for this solution, $p''(x)=0$ for all $x \\in [0,L]$, which makes the functional $\\mathcal{J}[p] = \\int_{0}^{L} 0^2 \\, dx = 0$. Since the integrand $(p''(x))^2$ is non-negative, the value $0$ is the absolute minimum possible for $\\mathcal{J}[p]$. This confirms the correctness of the solution for the first part.\n\nFor the second part, we consider a fragment cut from the animal, spanning the interval $[x_1, x_2]$. The new positional field, $p_{\\mathrm{cut}}(x)$, is assumed to be an affine reparameterization of the original field $p(x)$ on this interval. This means:\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{cut}}(x) = A \\cdot p(x) + B\n$$\nfor some constants $A$ and $B$, where $x \\in [x_1, x_2]$. The new field must satisfy the renormalized boundary conditions $p_{\\mathrm{cut}}(x_1)=0$ and $p_{\\mathrm{cut}}(x_2)=1$. We use these conditions to determine $A$ and $B$:\n1.  $p_{\\mathrm{cut}}(x_1) = A \\cdot p(x_1) + B = 0$\n2.  $p_{\\mathrm{cut}}(x_2) = A \\cdot p(x_2) + B = 1$\n\nThis is a system of two linear equations in $A$ and $B$. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives:\n$$\nA(p(x_2) - p(x_1)) = 1 \\implies A = \\frac{1}{p(x_2) - p(x_1)}\n$$\nFrom the first equation, $B = -A \\cdot p(x_1)$. Substituting the expression for $A$:\n$$\nB = -\\frac{p(x_1)}{p(x_2) - p(x_1)}\n$$\nSubstituting $A$ and $B$ back into the expression for $p_{\\mathrm{cut}}(x)$:\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{cut}}(x) = \\frac{p(x)}{p(x_2) - p(x_1)} - \\frac{p(x_1)}{p(x_2) - p(x_1)} = \\frac{p(x) - p(x_1)}{p(x_2) - p(x_1)}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the explicit form of $p(x) = x/L$ into this general renormalization formula. We have $p(x_1) = x_1/L$ and $p(x_2) = x_2/L$.\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{cut}}(x) = \\frac{\\frac{x}{L} - \\frac{x_1}{L}}{\\frac{x_2}{L} - \\frac{x_1}{L}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{L}(x-x_1)}{\\frac{1}{L}(x_2-x_1)}\n$$\nThe factor of $1/L$ cancels, yielding the final expression for the renormalized field:\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{cut}}(x) = \\frac{x - x_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n$$\nThis gives the closed-form solutions for both parts of the problem.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{x}{L} & \\frac{x-x_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2667734"}, {"introduction": "A positional gradient is only useful if cells can interpret it to make distinct developmental decisions, such as becoming a \"head\" cell or a \"body column\" cell.
