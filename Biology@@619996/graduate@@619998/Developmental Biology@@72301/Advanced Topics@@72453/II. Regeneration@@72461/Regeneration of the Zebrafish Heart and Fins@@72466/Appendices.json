No flaws are identified.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\nThe fundamental principle of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the exponential amplification of a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) template. The quantity of product, $N_C$, after $C$ cycles is given by $N_C = N_0 \\times E^C$, where $N_0$ is the initial quantity of template and $E$ is the amplification efficiency. The problem states that the efficiency is perfect, so $E=2$.\n\nThe cycle threshold, $C_t$, is the cycle number at which the fluorescence signal, which is proportional to the amount of PCR product, crosses a fixed threshold. This corresponds to a constant amount of product, $N_{thresh}$. Therefore, at the threshold cycle:\n$$N_{thresh} = N_0 \\times E^{C_t}$$\nGiven $E=2$, we have $N_{thresh} = N_0 \\times 2^{C_t}$.\nRearranging this equation to solve for the initial quantity of template, $N_0$, gives:\n$$N_0 = N_{thresh} \\times 2^{-C_t}$$\nSince $N_{thresh}$ is a constant for the entire experiment, the initial quantity of a specific messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) transcript is inversely proportional to $2$ raised to the power of its $C_t$ value:\n$$N_0 \\propto 2^{-C_t}$$\n\nTo determine the relative change in gene expression, the expression of the target gene (TG) must be normalized to the expression of stable reference genes (RG). This normalization step corrects for variations in the initial amount of total RNA and the efficiency of the reverse transcription step. The problem specifies a normalization to the geometric mean of the two reference genes, $rpl13a$ (RG1) and $actb1$ (RG2).\n\nThe initial quantity for the geometric mean of the reference genes, $N_{0, RG, \\text{geom}}$, is:\n$$N_{0, \\text{RG, geom}} = \\sqrt{N_{0, \\text{RG1}} \\times N_{0, \\text{RG2}}}$$\nSubstituting the relationship $N_0 \\propto 2^{-C_t}$:\n$$N_{0, \\text{RG, geom}} \\propto \\sqrt{2^{-C_{t, \\text{RG1}}} \\times 2^{-C_{t, \\text{RG2}}}} = \\sqrt{2^{-(C_{t, \\text{RG1}} + C_{t, \\text{RG2}})}} = 2^{-\\frac{C_{t, \\text{RG1}} + C_{t, \\text{RG2}}}{2}}$$\nThis demonstrates that the effective $C_t$ value for the geometric mean normalization is the arithmetic mean of the individual reference gene $C_t$ values. Let us denote this as $C_{t, \\text{ref\\_norm}}$.\n$$C_{t, \\text{ref\\_norm}} = \\frac{C_{t, \\text{RG1}} + C_{t, \\text{RG2}}}{2}$$\n\nThe normalized expression of the target gene is determined by the $\\Delta C_t$ value, which is the difference between the target gene's $C_t$ and the normalization factor's $C_t$. For any sample (spl):\n$$\\Delta C_{t, \\text{spl}} = C_{t, \\text{TG}, \\text{spl}} - C_{t, \\text{ref\\_norm}, \\text{spl}}$$\nThe relative normalized expression level is proportional to $2^{-\\Delta C_t}$.\n\nWe first calculate the normalization factor $C_t$ for each condition.\nFor the uninjured (U) calibrator sample:\n$$C_{t, \\text{ref\\_norm}, U} = \\frac{C_{t, rpl13a, U} + C_{t, actb1, U}}{2} = \\frac{23.20 + 22.80}{2} = \\frac{46.00}{2} = 23.00$$\nFor the injured (I) test sample:\n$$C_{t, \\text{ref\\_norm}, I} = \\frac{C_{t, rpl13a, I} + C_{t, actb1, I}}{2} = \\frac{23.40 + 22.90}{2} = \\frac{46.30}{2} = 23.15$$\n\nNext, we calculate the $\\Delta C_t$ for each condition.\nFor the uninjured sample:\n$$\\Delta C_{t, U} = C_{t, \\text{TG}, U} - C_{t, \\text{ref\\_norm}, U} = 31.00 - 23.00 = 8.00$$\nFor the injured sample:\n$$\\Delta C_{t, I} = C_{t, \\text{TG}, I} - C_{t, \\text{ref\\_norm}, I} = 27.40 - 23.15 = 4.25$$\n\nThe fold change (FC) in target gene expression in the injured sample relative to the uninjured sample is calculated using the delta-delta $C_t$ ($\\Delta\\Delta C_t$) method. The $\\Delta\\Delta C_t$ is the difference in $\\Delta C_t$ values between the test and calibrator samples.\n$$\\Delta\\Delta C_t = \\Delta C_{t, I} - \\Delta C_{t, U} = 4.25 - 8.00 = -3.75$$\n\nThe fold change is given by the formula $FC = E^{-\\Delta\\Delta C_t}$.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to determine the fraction $f$ of progenitor-like cardiomyocytes in the injured heart. This will be accomplished by relating the macroscopic, bulk measurement of gene expression (from qPCR) to the microscopic composition of the tissue (the fractions of two cell types with different expression levels).\n\nFirst, we determine the relative fold-change ($FC$) of gene $G$ expression in the injured heart compared to the sham heart. The normalized expression level, $E$, of a gene is inversely proportional to $2^{C_t}$ for the target gene, and is normalized by the expression of a housekeeping gene. Let $C_{t,G}$ be the cycle threshold for gene $G$ and $C_{t,H}$ be for the housekeeping gene $ef1a$. The normalized expression is thus proportional to the ratio of their initial template amounts:\n$$ E \\propto \\frac{2^{-C_{t,G}}}{2^{-C_{t,H}}} = 2^{-(C_{t,G} - C_{t,H})} = 2^{-\\Delta C_t} $$\nThe fold-change, $FC$, between the injured condition and the sham condition is the ratio of their respective normalized expression levels:\n$$ FC = \\frac{E_{\\text{inj}}}{E_{\\text{sham}}} = \\frac{2^{-\\Delta C_{t,\\text{inj}}}}{2^{-\\Delta C_{t,\\text{sham}}}} = 2^{\\Delta C_{t,\\text{sham}} - \\Delta C_{t,\\text{inj}}} $$\nThis is the standard $\\Delta\\Delta C_t$ method.\n\nLet us calculate the $\\Delta C_t$ values from the provided data:\nFor the injured heart:\n$$ \\Delta C_{t,\\text{inj}} = C_{t,G,\\text{inj}} - C_{t,ef1a,\\text{inj}} = 26.9 - 19.9 = 7.0 $$\nFor the sham heart:\n$$ \\Delta C_{t,\\text{sham}} = C_{t,G,\\text{sham}} - C_{t,ef1a,\\text{sham}} = 29.8 - 20.2 = 9.6 $$\nNow, we can compute the fold-change:\n$$ FC = 2^{(9.6 - 7.0)} = 2^{2.6} $$\n\nNext, we formulate a theoretical expression for this fold-change based on the cellular composition. Let $M_{0}$ be the average number of transcripts of gene $G$ per cardiomyocyte in the sham-operated heart, where all cells are considered differentiated. Assuming the total number of cardiomyocytes, $C$, is constant, the total abundance of $G$ transcripts in the sham heart, $T_{\\text{sham}}$, is:\n$$ T_{\\text{sham}} = C \\cdot M_{0} $$\nIn the injured heart, we have a mixed population. A fraction $f$ of cells are progenitor-like, and a fraction $1-f$ are differentiated. The problem states that the expression of $G$ in progenitor-like cells, $M_{\\text{prog}}$, is $s$-fold higher than in differentiated cells. We assume the expression level in the differentiated cells within the injured heart, $M_{\\text{diff}}$, is the same as in the sham heart, i.e., $M_{\\text{diff}} = M_{0}$. Therefore:\n$$ M_{\\text{prog}} = s \\cdot M_{\\text{diff}} = s \\cdot M_{0} $$\nThe total abundance of $G$ transcripts in the injured heart, $T_{\\text{inj}}$, is the sum of transcripts from both populations:\n$$ T_{\\text{inj}} = (\\text{number of progenitor-like cells}) \\cdot M_{\\text{prog}} + (\\text{number of differentiated cells}) \\cdot M_{\\text{diff}} $$\n$$ T_{\\text{inj}} = (f \\cdot C) \\cdot (s \\cdot M_{0}) + ((1-f) \\cdot C) \\cdot M_{0} $$\nFactoring out $C \\cdot M_{0}$:\n$$ T_{\\text{inj}} = C \\cdot M_{0} \\cdot (f \\cdot s + (1-f)) $$\nThe theoretical fold-change is the ratio of total transcripts, $T_{\\text{inj}}/T_{\\text{sham}}$, since the total cell number $C$ and the housekeeping gene expression are assumed constant, serving as the basis for normalization.\n$$ FC_{\\text{model}} = \\frac{T_{\\text{inj}}}{T_{\\text{sham}}} = \\frac{C \\cdot M_{0} \\cdot (f s + 1 - f)}{C \\cdot M_{0}} = f s + 1 - f $$\n\nBy equating the experimentally measured fold-change with the theoretical model, we can solve for $f$:\n$$ FC = f s + 1 - f $$\n$$ FC = f(s-1) + 1 $$\n$$ FC - 1 = f(s-1) $$\n$$ f = \\frac{FC - 1}{s - 1} $$\nNow, we substitute the known values: $FC = 2^{2.6}$ and $s = 30$.\n$$ f = \\frac{2^{2.6} - 1}{30 - 1} = \\frac{2^{2.6} - 1}{29} $$\nWe perform the numerical calculation:\n$$ 2^{2.6} \\approx 6.06286643 $$\n$$ f \\approx \\frac{6.06286643 - 1}{29} = \\frac{5.06286643}{29} \\approx 0.17458160 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$ f \\approx 0.1746 $$\nThis value represents the fraction of cardiomyocytes that are in a progenitor-like state in the injured heart at the specified time point.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1746}$$", "id": "2668435"}, {"introduction": "To truly understand and manipulate a biological system, we must move beyond correlation to establish causal relationships.

Thus, $N_3 = (\\gamma I_3 + \\varepsilon_N) + \\Delta_N^{\\star}$.\nThe final value of $P$ is $P_3 = \\alpha N_3 + \\beta I_3 + \\varepsilon_P$.\nThe new expected value of $P$ is:\n$$E_3[P] = E[\\alpha((\\gamma(I + \\Delta_I^{\\star}) + \\varepsilon_N) + \\Delta_N^{\\star}) + \\beta(I + \\Delta_I^{\\star}) + \\varepsilon_P]$$\n$$E_3[P] = \\alpha(\\gamma(E_0[I] + \\Delta_I^{\\star}) + \\Delta_N^{\\star}) + \\beta(E_0[I] + \\Delta_I^{\\star})$$\n$$E_3[P] = (\\alpha\\gamma+\\beta)E_0[I] + (\\alpha\\gamma+\\beta)\\Delta_I^{\\star} + \\alpha\\Delta_N^{\\star}$$\nThe expected change in $P$ is $\\Delta_P^{\\star} = E_3[P] - E_0[P]$:\n$$\\Delta_P^{\\star} = (\\alpha\\gamma+\\beta)\\Delta_I^{\\star} + \\alpha\\Delta_N^{\\star}$$\nThis result shows that in a linear system, the total change is the sum of the changes induced by each intervention path. We substitute the inferred coefficients and given intervention values:\n$$\\Delta_P^{\\star} = ((0.52)(0.8) + 0.684)(-0.5) + (0.52)(2.0)$$\n$$\\Delta_P^{\\star} = (0.416 + 0.684)(-0.5) + 1.04$$\n$$\\Delta_P^{\\star} = (1.1)(-0.5) + 1.04$$\n$$\\Delta_P^{\\star} = -0.55 + 1.04 = 0.49$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n\n$\\Delta_P^{\\star} = 0.490$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.490}\n$$", "id": "2668468"}]}
