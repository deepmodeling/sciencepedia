This exercise brings that metaphor to life by translating it into a concrete mathematical model, where cell states are represented as attractors in a potential energy landscape.

Consider a minimal Waddington-type landscape model for the reprogramming decision along a one-dimensional order parameter $x$ that interpolates between the primed ($x<0$) and naive ($x>0$) attractors. Assume gradient dynamics $dx/dt=-dU/dx$ with the potential\n$$\nU(x)=\\alpha x^{4}-\\beta x^{2}-\\gamma x,\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha>0$ ensures boundedness of the landscape from below and $\\beta>0$ encodes the intrinsic capacity for bistability of the core pluripotency network.

This is a canonical model for bistability and first-order phase transitions, widely and appropriately used in theoretical physics, chemistry, and biology to model systems with two stable states. The biological interpretation of the parameters is consistent with the known roles of Oct4, LIF/2i signaling ($S_N$), and FGF/Activin signaling ($S_P$) in pluripotency regulation. The model is a valid, albeit simplified, representation of a Waddington landscape.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem asks for two well-defined mathematical objects: a condition on the parameters $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)$ for the existence of three distinct real stationary points (two minima, one maximum), and a specific value of a parameter ($O$) that satisfies an algebraic constraint on the potential values at the minima. These are standard and solvable problems in bifurcation analysis.\n- **Objective:** The problem is formulated in precise mathematical language, free from subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a valid problem of mathematical biology. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe stationary points of the potential $U(x)$ are the locations where the force, $F = -dU/dx$, is zero. These are the critical points of the potential, found by solving $dU/dx = 0$.\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dx} = 4\\alpha x^{3} - 2\\beta x - \\gamma = 0\n$$\nThis is a depressed cubic equation in $x$. For the potential to have two minima (attracting fixed points) and one maximum (repelling fixed point), this cubic equation must have three distinct real roots. Let us denote the function $f(x) = 4\\alpha x^{3} - 2\\beta x$. The roots of our equation are the intersections of the curve $y=f(x)$ with the horizontal line $y=\\gamma$. The function $f(x)$ has local extrema where $f'(x) = 12\\alpha x^{2} - 2\\beta = 0$, which occurs at $x = \\pm\\sqrt{2\\beta / (12\\alpha)} = \\pm\\sqrt{\\beta / (6\\alpha)}$.\nThe values of $f(x)$ at these extrema are:\n$$\nf\\left(\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta}{6\\alpha}}\\right) = 4\\alpha \\left(\\pm\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{6\\alpha}\\right)^{3/2}\\right) - 2\\beta \\left(\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta}{6\\alpha}}\\right) = \\pm\\left( \\frac{4\\alpha\\beta^{3/2}}{6\\sqrt{6}\\alpha^{3/2}} - \\frac{2\\beta^{3/2}}{\\sqrt{6\\alpha}} \\right) = \\pm\\left( \\frac{2\\beta^{3/2}}{3\\sqrt{6\\alpha}} - \\frac{2\\beta^{3/2}}{\\sqrt{6\\alpha}} \\right) = \\mp \\frac{4\\beta^{3/2}}{3\\sqrt{6\\alpha}}\n$$\nFor three distinct real roots to exist, $\\gamma$ must lie strictly between these two extremal values:\n$$\n-\\frac{4\\beta^{3/2}}{3\\sqrt{6\\alpha}} < \\gamma < \\frac{4\\beta^{3/2}}{3\\sqrt{6\\alpha}}\n$$\nThis is equivalent to $\\gamma^2 < \\left(\\frac{4\\beta^{3/2}}{3\\sqrt{6\\alpha}}\\right)^2$, which simplifies to:\n$$\n\\gamma^2 < \\frac{16\\beta^3}{9 \\cdot 6\\alpha} = \\frac{16\\beta^3}{54\\alpha} = \\frac{8\\beta^3}{27\\alpha}\n$$\nThus, the condition for the existence of a two-basin regime is $27\\alpha\\gamma^2 < 8\\beta^3$.\n\nNext, we must find the condition under which the two minima are of equal depth. Let the three roots of $dU/dx = 0$ be $x_p$, $x_b$, and $x_n$, corresponding to the primed minimum, the barrier maximum, and the naive minimum, respectively. The condition for equal potential energy at the minima is $U(x_p) = U(x_n)$.\n$$\n\\alpha x_p^4 - \\beta x_p^2 - \\gamma x_p = \\alpha x_n^4 - \\beta x_n^2 - \\gamma x_n\n$$\nRearranging the terms yields:\n$$\n\\alpha(x_n^4 - x_p^4) - \\beta(x_n^2 - x_p^2) = \\gamma(x_n - x_p)\n$$\nSince $x_n$ and $x_p$ are distinct minima, $x_n \\neq x_p$, and we can divide by $(x_n - x_p)$:\n$$\n\\alpha(x_n+x_p)(x_n^2+x_p^2) - \\beta(x_n+x_p) = \\gamma\n$$\nThis expression relates $\\gamma$ to the roots. We can establish a more direct condition. The potential $U(x)$ can be decomposed into an even part, $U_{even}(x) = \\alpha x^4 - \\beta x^2$, and an odd part, $U_{odd}(x) = -\\gamma x$. The even part is symmetric about $x=0$ and, for $\\beta > 0$, possesses two minima of equal depth. The odd part, a linear tilt, raises the potential for $x<0$ and lowers it for $x>0$ (if $\\gamma>0$), or vice versa (if $\\gamma<0$). For the total potential $U(x)$ to have minima of equal depth, this symmetry-breaking tilt must be absent. This occurs precisely when $\\gamma=0$.\n\nWe can prove this formally. From Vieta's formulas for the cubic equation $x^3 - \\frac{\\beta}{2\\alpha}x - \\frac{\\gamma}{4\\alpha} = 0$, the sum of the roots is zero:\n$$\nx_p + x_b + x_n = 0\n$$\nAn additional relation can be derived from the condition $U(x_p) = U(x_n)$, which is equivalent to $\\int_{x_p}^{x_n} (dU/dx) dx = 0$. A more advanced result, known as the Maxwell condition for this potential, confirms that the equal-depth condition is simply $\\gamma = 0$. Let us demonstrate this.\nIf $\\gamma = 0$, the potential becomes $U(x) = \\alpha x^4 - \\beta x^2$. The minima are found from $4\\alpha x^3 - 2\\beta x = 2x(2\\alpha x^2 - \\beta) = 0$. The roots are $x=0$ (the maximum) and $x = \\pm\\sqrt{\\beta/(2\\alpha)}$. Let $x_n = \\sqrt{\\beta/(2\\alpha)}$ and $x_p = -\\sqrt{\\beta/(2\\alpha)}$. The potential at these minima is:\n$$\nU(x_{p,n}) = \\alpha \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{2\\alpha}\\right)^2 - \\beta \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{2\\alpha}\\right) = \\frac{\\beta^2}{4\\alpha} - \\frac{\\beta^2}{2\\alpha} = -\\frac{\\beta^2}{4\\alpha}\n$$\nThe depths are equal. Conversely, if the depths are equal, any non-zero $\\gamma$ would break the symmetry of the potential landscape, making one well deeper than the other. The only way for the two wells to have identical energy is for the potential to be perfectly symmetric, which requires $\\gamma=0$. This holds strictly inside the two-basin regime. The only other solution corresponds to the cusp boundary where a minimum and maximum merge, which is not \"in\" the two-basin regime.\n\nTherefore, the condition for the naive and primed attractors to be of equal depth is $\\gamma = 0$. We use this to find the critical Oct4 dosage, $O^{\\ast}$.\n$$\n\\gamma = \\kappa_{O}\\,O^{\\ast} + \\kappa_{N}\\,S_{N} - \\kappa_{P}\\,S_{P} = 0\n$$\nSolving for $O^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\kappa_{O}\\,O^{\\ast} = \\kappa_{P}\\,S_{P} - \\kappa_{N}\\,S_{N}\n$$\n$$\nO^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\kappa_{P}\\,S_{P} - \\kappa_{N}\\,S_{N}}{\\kappa_{O}}\n$$\nThis expression gives the critical Oct4 dosage where the opposing influences of naive- and primed-promoting signals are balanced, resulting in a symmetric bistable landscape.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\kappa_{P}S_{P} - \\kappa_{N}S_{N}}{\\kappa_{O}}}\n$$", "id": "2644820"}, {"introduction": "The abstract energy landscapes that govern cell fate are ultimately shaped by concrete molecular machinery.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe metrics are defined from first principles using the confusion matrix components: true positives ($TP$), false positives ($FP$), and false negatives ($FN$).\nPrecision, or Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$), is the fraction of positive predictions that are actually correct:\n$$ \\text{Precision} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP} $$\nRecall, or Sensitivity, is the fraction of actual positives that are correctly identified:\n$$ \\text{Recall} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} $$\nThe $F_1$ score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure:\n$$ F_{1} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\text{Precision} \\cdot \\text{Recall}}{\\text{Precision} + \\text{Recall}} = \\frac{2 \\cdot TP}{2 \\cdot TP + FP + FN} $$\n\nPart 1: Calculation of metrics for each assay.\n\nFor Assay M:\nWe are given $TP_{M}=60$, $FP_{M}=60$, and $FN_{M}=12$.\nThe precision for Assay M is:\n$$ \\text{Precision}_{M} = \\frac{TP_{M}}{TP_{M} + FP_{M}} = \\frac{60}{60 + 60} = \\frac{60}{120} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe recall for Assay M is:\n$$ \\text{Recall}_{M} = \\frac{TP_{M}}{TP_{M} + FN_{M}} = \\frac{60}{60 + 12} = \\frac{60}{72} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 12}{6 \\cdot 12} = \\frac{5}{6} $$\nThe $F_{1}$ score for Assay M is:\n$$ F_{1, M} = \\frac{2 \\cdot TP_{M}}{2 \\cdot TP_{M} + FP_{M} + FN_{M}} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 60}{2 \\cdot 60 + 60 + 12} = \\frac{120}{120 + 72} = \\frac{120}{192} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 24}{8 \\cdot 24} = \\frac{5}{8} $$\n\nFor Assay F:\nWe are given $TP_{F}=54$, $FP_{F}=12$, and $FN_{F}=18$.\nThe precision for Assay F is:\n$$ \\text{Precision}_{F} = \\frac{TP_{F}}{TP_{F} + FP_{F}} = \\frac{54}{54 + 12} = \\frac{54}{66} = \\frac{9 \\cdot 6}{11 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{9}{11} $$\nThe recall for Assay F is:\n$$ \\text{Recall}_{F} = \\frac{TP_{F}}{TP_{F} + FN_{F}} = \\frac{54}{54 + 18} = \\frac{54}{72} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 18}{4 \\cdot 18} = \\frac{3}{4} $$\nThe $F_{1}$ score for Assay F is:\n$$ F_{1, F} = \\frac{2 \\cdot TP_{F}}{2 \\cdot TP_{F} + FP_{F} + FN_{F}} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 54}{2 \\cdot 54 + 12 + 18} = \\frac{108}{108 + 30} = \\frac{108}{138} = \\frac{18 \\cdot 6}{23 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{18}{23} $$\n\nPart 2: Selection of summary metric based on cost.\nThe problem states a cost ratio of $c_{FP}/c_{FN}=3$, meaning the marginal cost of a false positive ($c_{FP}$) is three times greater than the cost of a false negative ($c_{FN}$). A rational decision-making process must prioritize the minimization of the more costly error type. In this case, we must be especially stringent about avoiding false positives.\n\nLet us examine the metrics in relation to the error types:\n- Precision is defined as $TP / (TP + FP)$. It is directly and inversely sensitive to the number of false positives. A high count of $FP$ will severely penalize the precision score.\n- Recall is defined as $TP / (TP + FN)$. It is sensitive to false negatives, not false positives.\n- The $F_1$ score balances precision and recall equally, which implicitly assumes equal cost for $FP$ and $FN$.\n\nSince the cost of false positives is substantially higher, the performance metric that most directly reflects the goal of minimizing $FP$ must be emphasized. This metric is precision. Thus, when comparing assays or tuning a classification threshold under this cost structure, one should prioritize achieving higher precision. The general framework for this is the $F_{\\beta}$ score, where $\\beta^2$ is the ratio of the cost of a false negative to a false positive, $\\beta^2 = c_{FN}/c_{FP}$. Here, $\\beta^2 = 1/3$, so $\\beta = 1/\\sqrt{3} < 1$. An $F_{\\beta}$ score with $\\beta < 1$ weighs precision more heavily than recall. The problem asks which of the three standard metrics (precision, recall, $F_1$) to emphasize. Given the high cost of false positives, precision is the correct choice.\nThe encoding for precision is $s=1$.\n\nThe final result vector is composed of the six calculated metrics and the choice parameter $s$:\n$[\\text{Precision}_{M}, \\text{Recall}_{M}, F_{1, M}, \\text{Precision}_{F}, \\text{Recall}_{F}, F_{1, F}, s]$.\nSubstituting the computed values:\n$[\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{5}{6}, \\frac{5}{8}, \\frac{9}{11}, \\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{18}{23}, 1]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{5}{6} & \\frac{5}{8} & \\frac{9}{11} & \\frac{3}{4} & \\frac{18}{23} & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2644808"}]}
