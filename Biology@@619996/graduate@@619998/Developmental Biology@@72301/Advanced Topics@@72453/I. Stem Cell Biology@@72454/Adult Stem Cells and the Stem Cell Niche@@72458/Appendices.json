Consider the following mechanistic assumptions grounded in standard stem-cell fate modeling. Each stem cell divides at a per-capita rate $r$ (units: $\\text{time}^{-1}$). Upon division, each of the two daughter cells independently self-renews into a stem cell with probability $s \\in [0,1]$ and differentiates into a non-stem cell with probability $1-s$. Thus, the expected number of stem-cell daughters per division is $2s$. Additionally, stem cells are lost through niche exit or death at a per-capita rate $\\delta \\ge 0$ (units: $\\text{time}^{-1}$), independent of division. Let $S(t)$ denote the expected number of stem cells at time $t$.\n\nUsing only these definitions and standard expectation arguments, first derive the ordinary differential equation for $S(t)$ implied by this fate process.

The assumptions provided are mechanistic and form a simplified but scientifically sound basis for modeling stem cell population dynamics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and an initial condition to derive and solve a differential equation. The terminology is precise and objective. There are no violations of scientific principles, logical contradictions, or ambiguities. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe primary task is to construct an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the expected number of stem cells, $S(t)$. We model the rate of change of $S(t)$, denoted $\\frac{dS}{dt}$, by accounting for all processes that increase or decrease the stem cell population.\n\nThe change in the expected number of stem cells is the sum of the expected rates of production and loss.\n1.  **Change due to cell division:** The total rate at which divisions occur in a population of size $S(t)$ is $rS(t)$. Each division event involves one parent stem cell, which is consumed, and the production of two daughter cells. Each daughter cell becomes a stem cell with probability $s$. Therefore, the expected number of new stem cells created per division is $2s$. The net change in the number of stem cells from one division event is the number of new stem cells created minus the one parent stem cell that was lost: $2s - 1$. The total rate of change in the stem cell population due to division is the product of the rate of divisions and the net change per division:\n    $$\n    \\text{Rate of change from division} = (2s - 1) \\cdot rS(t)\n    $$\n2.  **Change due to cell loss:** Stem cells are lost through processes independent of division at a per-capita rate $\\delta$. For a population of size $S(t)$, the total rate of loss is:\n    $$\n    \\text{Rate of change from loss} = -\\delta S(t)\n    $$\n\nCombining these two rates gives the total rate of change for the expected stem cell population, $S(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{dt} = r(2s - 1)S(t) - \\delta S(t)\n$$\nThis equation can be simplified by factoring out $S(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\left[ r(2s - 1) - \\delta \\right] S(t)\n$$\nThis is the required first-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. For convenience, let the constant term $\\lambda = r(2s - 1) - \\delta$. The ODE becomes $\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\lambda S(t)$.\n\nNext, we solve this ODE with the initial condition $S(0) = S_0$. This is a separable equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{S} = \\lambda dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial state $(0, S_0)$ to a state $(t, S(t))$:\n$$\n\\int_{S_0}^{S(t)} \\frac{1}{S'} dS' = \\int_{0}^{t} \\lambda dt'\n$$\n$$\n[\\ln|S'|]_{S_0}^{S(t)} = [\\lambda t']_{0}^{t}\n$$\nSince $S(t)$ represents a population, $S(t) > 0$. Therefore, $\\ln(S(t)) - \\ln(S_0) = \\lambda t$.\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{S(t)}{S_0}\\right) = \\lambda t\n$$\nSolving for $S(t)$ by exponentiating both sides yields the general solution:\n$$\nS(t) = S_0 \\exp(\\lambda t) = S_0 \\exp\\left( \\left[ r(2s - 1) - \\delta \\right] t \\right)\n$$\n\nNow, we identify the steady states and their stability. A steady state, $S^*$, is a value of $S$ for which $\\frac{dS}{dt} = 0$.\n$$\n\\left[ r(2s - 1) - \\delta \\right] S^* = 0\n$$\nThe only solution is $S^* = 0$, which represents population extinction. The stability of this steady state is determined by the sign of the exponent $\\lambda = r(2s - 1) - \\delta$.\n- If $\\lambda  0$, then $S(t) \\to 0$ as $t \\to \\infty$. The population declines to extinction. The steady state $S^*=0$ is **stable**. This occurs when $s  \\frac{r+\\delta}{2r}$.\n- If $\\lambda > 0$, then $S(t) \\to \\infty$ as $t \\to \\infty$ (assuming $S_0 > 0$). The population grows exponentially. The steady state $S^*=0$ is **unstable**. This occurs when $s > \\frac{r+\\delta}{2r}$.\n- If $\\lambda = 0$, then $S(t) = S_0$ for all $t$. The population size remains constant. This is a case of **marginal stability**, where a line of non-isolated fixed points exists.\n\nThe critical self-renewal probability, $s_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, is defined as the value of $s$ that separates long-term decline from long-term growth. This corresponds to the case of marginal stability, where the net growth rate is zero.\n$$\n\\lambda = r(2s_{\\mathrm{crit}} - 1) - \\delta = 0\n$$\nWe solve this equation for $s_{\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$\nr(2s_{\\mathrm{crit}} - 1) = \\delta\n$$\n$$\n2s_{\\mathrm{crit}} - 1 = \\frac{\\delta}{r}\n$$\n$$\n2s_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 1 + \\frac{\\delta}{r}\n$$\n$$\n2s_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{r + \\delta}{r}\n$$\n$$\ns_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{r + \\delta}{2r}\n$$\nThis expression provides the critical threshold for the self-renewal probability. If $s > s_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, the stem cell population expands. If $s  s_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, it contracts toward extinction. If $s = s_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, it is maintained at its initial size.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{r+\\delta}{2r}}$$", "id": "2617075"}, {"introduction": "Building on the abstract concept of fate choice, we now explore how the physical microenvironment—the niche—regulates this critical decision.

I will proceed with the solution, which involves a step-by-step implementation of the defined pipeline.\n\nThe pipeline comprises five main stages: (1) data representation, (2) gene-wise normalization and activation, (3) stemness scoring and cell selection, (4) ligand–receptor signaling quantification, and (5) computation of summary outputs. Let us formalize each step.\n\n**1. Data Representation and Pre-processing**\n\nThe input data for each test case consists of an expression matrix $E \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times m}$, where $n$ is the number of cells and $m$ is the number of genes. $E_{i,g}$ represents the expression level of gene $g$ in cell $i$. The gene symbols are given by an ordered list $G$. We are also given a set of stemness marker genes $M_{\\mathrm{stem}}$, differentiation marker genes $M_{\\mathrm{diff}}$, a set of ligand-receptor pairs $\\mathcal{P}$, and a cell-cell influence matrix $W$.\n\nTo facilitate computation, we first create a mapping from gene symbols in $G$ to their corresponding column indices ($0$ to $m-1$) in the matrix $E$. This allows for efficient retrieval of gene expression data.\n\n**2. Gene-wise Normalization and Activation**\n\nThe raw gene expression values in $E$ are not directly comparable across different genes due to variations in measurement scale and transcription rates. A standard method to normalize the data is to compute z-scores. For each gene $g$, we first calculate its mean expression $\\mu_g$ and population standard deviation $\\sigma_g$ across all $n$ cells:\n$$ \\mu_{g} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E_{i,g} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{g} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(E_{i,g} - \\mu_{g}\\right)^{2}} $$\nA small numerical stabilizer $\\epsilon = 10^{-8}$ is added to the standard deviation to prevent division by zero for genes with no expression variance. The standardized expression, or z-score, $Z_{i,g}$ for gene $g$ in cell $i$ is then:\n$$ Z_{i,g} = \\frac{E_{i,g} - \\mu_{g}}{\\sigma_{g} + \\epsilon} $$\nThis transformation centers the expression of each gene to have a mean of approximately $0$ and scales it to have a standard deviation of approximately $1$.\n\nTo model gene activity, we apply a rectification function. The activation $A_{i,g}$ is defined as the non-negative part of the z-score, representing up-regulation relative to the average:\n$$ A_{i,g} = \\max\\{Z_{i,g}, 0\\} $$\nThis results in two matrices, $Z$ and $A$, both of size $n \\times m$.\n\n**3. Stemness Scoring and Selection**\n\nStem-like cells are identified based on their expression of marker genes. A stemness score $s_i$ is computed for each cell $i$ by contrasting the average standardized expression of stemness markers ($M_{\\mathrm{stem}}$) with that of differentiation markers ($M_{\\mathrm{diff}}$):\n$$ s_{i} = \\frac{1}{|M_{\\mathrm{stem}}|} \\sum_{g \\in M_{\\mathrm{stem}}} Z_{i,g} \\;-\\; \\frac{1}{|M_{\\mathrm{diff}}|} \\sum_{g \\in M_{\\mathrm{diff}}} Z_{i,g} $$\nA higher score indicates a cellular state more consistent with stemness.\n\nNext, we select a subset of cells that are most stem-like. Given a selection fraction $f \\in (0,1]$, the number of cells to select is $k = \\left\\lfloor f \\cdot n \\right\\rfloor$. A special condition ensures at least one cell is selected by setting $k=1$ if the floor operation results in $k=0$. We identify the $k$ cells with the highest stemness scores. Ties in $s_i$ are broken by selecting the cell with the smaller original index. This produces a unique set of selected stem-like cell indices, denoted by $S$. The number of selected cells is $n_{\\mathrm{stem}} = |S| = k$.\n\n**4. Ligand–Receptor Signaling and Niche Score Calculation**\n\nIntercellular communication is modeled via ligand-receptor interactions. First, the provided list of pairs $\\mathcal{P}$ is filtered to retain only those pairs $(\\ell, r)$ where both the ligand gene $\\ell$ and the receptor gene $r$ are present in the gene list $G$. Let this valid set be $\\mathcal{P}^{\\star}$.\n\nThe potential signaling strength from a sender cell $a$ to a receiver cell $b$, denoted $\\mathrm{LR}(a,b)$, is computed by summing the products of ligand activation in the sender and receptor activation in the receiver, over all valid pairs:\n$$ \\mathrm{LR}(a,b) = \\sum_{(\\ell, r) \\in \\mathcal{P}^{\\star}} A_{a,\\ell} \\cdot A_{b,r} $$\nwhere $A_{a,\\ell}$ and $A_{b,r}$ are the rectified activations. If $\\mathcal{P}^{\\star}$ is empty, then $\\mathrm{LR}(a,b)=0$ for all $a,b$. This can be efficiently computed for all cell pairs using matrix multiplication. Let $A_L$ be the $n \\times |\\mathcal{P}^{\\star}|$ matrix of activations for all ligands in $\\mathcal{P}^{\\star}$ across all cells, and $A_R$ be the corresponding $n \\times |\\mathcal{P}^{\\star}|$ matrix for receptors. Then the $n \\times n$ matrix $\\mathrm{LR}$ is given by $\\mathrm{LR} = A_L A_R^T$.\n\nThe total signaling input, or niche score $N_b$, received by a cell $b$ is the weighted sum of signaling strengths from all potential sender cells $a$. The weights are given by the proximity matrix $W$, where $W_{a,b}$ represents the influence from sender $a$ to receiver $b$:\n$$ N_{b} = \\sum_{a=0}^{n-1} W_{a,b} \\cdot \\mathrm{LR}(a,b) $$\nThis calculation is performed for all receiver cells $b \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$. This corresponds to summing the columns of the element-wise product of matrices $W$ and $\\mathrm{LR}$.\n\n**5. Final Output Derivation**\n\nFor each test case, we must report three values:\n1. $n_{\\mathrm{stem}}$: The number of selected stem-like cells, which is equal to $k$.\n2. $b^{\\star}$: The index of the cell within the selected set $S$ that has the highest niche score $N_b$. Ties are broken by choosing the smaller cell index.\n3. $\\overline{N}_{S}$: The mean niche score across all cells in the selected set $S$, calculated as $\\overline{N}_{S} = \\frac{1}{|S|} \\sum_{b \\in S} N_{b}$ and rounded to three decimal places.\n\nThe final output is a single string containing a list of these triples, one for each test case, in the specified format `[[...],[...],[...]]`. The implementation will follow these steps exactly to ensure correctness.", "answer": "[[2,0,10.165],[2,0,0.0],[2,0,0.0]]", "id": "2617121"}]}
