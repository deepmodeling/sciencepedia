Single-cell pulse-chase measurements in progenitor cells show that $R$ has a half-life of $t_{1/2} = 25$ minutes when its abundance is within the physiological range relevant for development. At time $t=0$, a developmental signal induces a sustained transcriptional activation that increases the synthesis rate of $R$ from a negligible pre-signal value to a constant post-signal value of $S_1 = 2000$ molecules per minute per cell.

It presents a standard model of protein dynamics which can be formalized and solved using fundamental principles of chemical kinetics and differential equations. We proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $R(t)$ represent the abundance of the transcriptional regulator $R$ in a single cell at time $t$. The dynamics of $R(t)$ are governed by a mass balance equation, where the rate of change is the difference between the rate of synthesis and the rate of degradation.\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = (\\text{synthesis rate}) - (\\text{degradation rate}) $$\nFor time $t > 0$, the synthesis rate is given as a constant, $S_1 = 2000$ molecules/minute. The degradation is described as a first-order process, meaning its rate is directly proportional to the abundance of $R$. Therefore, the degradation rate can be written as $kR(t)$, where $k$ is the first-order degradation rate constant. The governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $t > 0$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = S_1 - kR(t) $$\nThe initial condition is that the abundance of $R$ is negligible before the signal, so we take $R(0) = 0$.\n\nThe degradation rate constant $k$ must be determined from the provided half-life, $t_{1/2} = 25$ minutes. For a first-order decay process in the absence of synthesis, the governing equation is $\\frac{dR}{dt} = -kR$. The solution to this equation is $R(t) = R_0 \\exp(-kt)$, where $R_0$ is the initial abundance. The half-life is defined as the time at which $R(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} R_0$. Substituting this into the solution gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} R_0 = R_0 \\exp(-kt_{1/2}) $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-kt_{1/2}) $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides yields $\\ln(\\frac{1}{2}) = -kt_{1/2}$, which simplifies to $-\\ln(2) = -kt_{1/2}$. Thus, the rate constant $k$ is related to the half-life $t_{1/2}$ by:\n$$ k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} $$\n\nNext, we identify the new steady-state abundance of $R$, denoted as $R_{ss}$, which is achieved when the system reaches equilibrium, i.e., when $\\frac{dR}{dt} = 0$. From the governing ODE:\n$$ 0 = S_1 - kR_{ss} $$\n$$ R_{ss} = \\frac{S_1}{k} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $k$, the steady-state abundance is $R_{ss} = \\frac{S_1 t_{1/2}}{\\ln(2)}$.\n\nTo find the time course $R(t)$, we must solve the initial value problem: $\\frac{dR}{dt} = S_1 - kR$ with $R(0) = 0$. This is a linear first-order ODE. We can rearrange it as $\\frac{dR}{dt} + kR = S_1$. The general solution can be found using an integrating factor or by recognizing its standard form. The solution is:\n$$ R(t) = \\frac{S_1}{k} + C\\exp(-kt) $$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. We use the initial condition $R(0)=0$ to find $C$:\n$$ R(0) = 0 = \\frac{S_1}{k} + C\\exp(0) \\implies C = -\\frac{S_1}{k} $$\nRecognizing that $\\frac{S_1}{k} = R_{ss}$, the specific solution for $R(t)$ is:\n$$ R(t) = R_{ss} - R_{ss}\\exp(-kt) = R_{ss}(1 - \\exp(-kt)) $$\n\nThe problem asks for the time $t_{0.9}$ required for the abundance of $R$ to reach exactly $90\\%$ of the way from its initial value, $R(0)=0$, to the new steady-state value, $R_{ss}$. The target abundance, $R_{target}$, is therefore:\n$$ R_{target} = R(0) + 0.90(R_{ss} - R(0)) = 0 + 0.90(R_{ss} - 0) = 0.9 R_{ss} $$\nWe must find the time $t_{0.9}$ such that $R(t_{0.9}) = R_{target}$.\n$$ R_{ss}(1 - \\exp(-kt_{0.9})) = 0.9 R_{ss} $$\nSince $S_1 > 0$, $R_{ss}$ is non-zero, and we can divide both sides by $R_{ss}$:\n$$ 1 - \\exp(-kt_{0.9}) = 0.9 $$\n$$ \\exp(-kt_{0.9}) = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1 $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -kt_{0.9} = \\ln(0.1) = \\ln(10^{-1}) = -\\ln(10) $$\n$$ t_{0.9} = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{k} $$\nNow we substitute the expression for $k$ in terms of the half-life $t_{1/2}$:\n$$ t_{0.9} = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}} = t_{1/2} \\frac{\\ln(10)}{\\ln(2)} $$\nThis analytical expression demonstrates that the time to reach a certain fraction of the steady state for a first-order system depends only on the half-life, not on the synthesis rate or the absolute steady-state abundance.\n\nFinally, we evaluate $t_{0.9}$ numerically using the given value $t_{1/2} = 25$ minutes.\n$$ t_{0.9} = 25 \\times \\frac{\\ln(10)}{\\ln(2)} $$\nUsing standard values for the natural logarithms, $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$ and $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$.\n$$ t_{0.9} \\approx 25 \\times \\frac{2.302585}{0.693147} \\approx 25 \\times 3.321928 \\approx 83.0482 \\text{ minutes} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested, we obtain:\n$$ t_{0.9} \\approx 83.05 \\text{ minutes} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{83.05}$$", "id": "2686598"}, {"introduction": "While theoretical models provide a conceptual framework, their true power is realized when connected to empirical evidence.

The problem is well-posed, objective, and free of flaws.\n\nSolution Derivation:\nThe disappearance of a substrate via a first-order decay process is described by the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = -kC\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the concentration or abundance of the substrate at time $t$, and $k$ is the first-order rate constant. To find the abundance as a function of time, we must solve this differential equation. We separate the variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{C} = -k \\, dt\n$$\nNext, we integrate both sides of the equation from the initial time $t=0$ to a later time $t$. The concentration changes from its initial value $C(0)$ to $C(t)$:\n$$\n\\int_{C(0)}^{C(t)} \\frac{dC'}{C'} = \\int_{0}^{t} -k \\, dt'\n$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$\n[\\ln(C')]_{C(0)}^{C(t)} = [-kt']_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(C(t)) - \\ln(C(0)) = -kt\n$$\nThis can be rearranged using the properties of logarithms:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C(0)}\\right) = -kt\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the integrated rate law for first-order kinetics:\n$$\n\\frac{C(t)}{C(0)} = \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThe problem provides normalized abundances, which correspond to the ratio $\\frac{C(t)}{C(0)}$. Let $C_A(t)$ and $C_B(t)$ be the abundances of cyclin A and cyclin B, respectively. The corresponding rate constants are $k_A$ and $k_B$.\n\nCalculation of $k_A$ for Cyclin A:\nThe model for cyclin A is:\n$$\n\\frac{C_A(t)}{C_A(0)} = \\exp(-k_A t)\n$$\nUsing the data point at $t=4$ min, where the normalized abundance is $0.45$:\n$$\n0.45 = \\exp(-k_A \\cdot 4)\n$$\nTo solve for $k_A$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln(0.45) = -4k_A\n$$\n$$\nk_A = -\\frac{\\ln(0.45)}{4} \\text{ min}^{-1}\n$$\n\nCalculation of $k_B$ for Cyclin B:\nSimilarly, the model for cyclin B is:\n$$\n\\frac{C_B(t)}{C_B(0)} = \\exp(-k_B t)\n$$\nUsing the data point at $t=4$ min, where the normalized abundance is $0.80$:\n$$\n0.80 = \\exp(-k_B \\cdot 4)\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm:\n$$\n\\ln(0.80) = -4k_B\n$$\n$$\nk_B = -\\frac{\\ln(0.80)}{4} \\text{ min}^{-1}\n$$\nThe consistency of the data at $t=8$ min for both cyclins confirms the validity of the first-order model.

Both match the given data.\n\nCalculation of the Ratio $R$:\nThe problem demands the calculation of the ratio $R = k_A / k_B$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{k_A}{k_B} = \\frac{-\\frac{\\ln(0.45)}{4}}{-\\frac{\\ln(0.80)}{4}}\n$$\nThe term $-1/4$ cancels from the numerator and the denominator, simplifying the expression to:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\ln(0.45)}{\\ln(0.80)}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\nR \\approx \\frac{-0.79851229}{-0.22314355} \\approx 3.57863\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as required, we get $R \\approx 3.58$.\n\nMechanistic Rationale for the Difference in $k$:\nThe calculated rate constants show that $k_A > k_B$, indicating that cyclin A is degraded significantly faster than cyclin B under the control of the APC/C. This difference in degradation kinetics is crucial for the ordered progression through mitosis. The rate-limiting step in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is often the recognition and binding of the substrate by the E3 ubiquitin ligase, in this case, the APC/C. This recognition is mediated by short peptide motifs on the substrate proteins called degrons. The primary degrons for APC/C substrates are the destruction box (D-box) and the Lys-Glu-Asn (KEN) box.\nThe efficiency of ubiquitination, and thus the magnitude of the degradation rate constant $k$, is a function of the affinity between the APC/C and its substrate. A higher affinity or more efficient catalytic processing results in a larger $k$. The problem allows us to hypothesize that a difference in degron architecture contributes to the observed difference in rates. If, for instance, cyclin A possesses a combination of a D-box and a KEN-box, while cyclin B possesses only a D-box, the dual recognition motifs on cyclin A would lead to a higher avidity interaction with the APC/C. This enhanced binding increases the probability and/or frequency of ubiquitin transfer, accelerating the formation of a polyubiquitin chain and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Therefore, a more complex or potent degron architecture, such as a D-box plus a KEN-box, provides a direct molecular mechanism for the observed higher degradation rate constant ($k_A > k_B$). Different APC/C coactivators (Cdc20 or Cdh1) also show preferences for different degrons, further contributing to the differential timing of substrate degradation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.58}\n$$", "id": "2686608"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concepts of degradation rates, this final practice delves into the biophysical mechanisms that determine their values.
