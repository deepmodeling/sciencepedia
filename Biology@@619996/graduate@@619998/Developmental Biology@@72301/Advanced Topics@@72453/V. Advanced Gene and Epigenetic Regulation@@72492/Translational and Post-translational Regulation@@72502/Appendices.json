Central Dogma and kinetic basis of elongation: translation elongation of a codon class $c \\in \\{\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{C}\\}$ proceeds with a per-codon elongation rate $r_c$ proportional to the abundance of its cognate tRNA, $a_c$, such that $r_c = k_0 a_c$, where $k_0$ is a proportionality constant set by ribosomal chemistry and units. The waiting time to elongate one codon of class $c$ is $t_c = 1/r_c = 1/(k_0 a_c)$. The time to translate a segment is the sum of its per-codon waiting times. Assume initiation is not rate-limiting and ribosomes are abundant, so the translation efficiency (TE) per mRNA scales inversely with the total elongation time across the coding sequence.\n\n2.

It utilizes standard concepts from molecular biology and kinetic modeling. The assumptions are abstractions of real phenomena like steric hindrance and stochastic reaction timing.\n3.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is mathematically well-defined. It describes a competition between two processes, one with a deterministic delay, which is a standard problem in probability theory. The setup provides all necessary information for a unique solution.\n4.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms, free from ambiguity or subjective content.\n\nThe problem is valid and I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the NMD Probability $P_{\\mathrm{NMD}}(L)$**\n\nLet us define the random variables representing the time until the key events occur, measured from the moment of translation termination (time $t=0$).\nLet $T_p$ be the waiting time for protective remodeling. According to assumption (iv), this is an exponential process with rate $k_p$. Thus, $T_p \\sim \\mathrm{Exp}(k_p)$. The probability that protective remodeling has not occurred by a time $t$ is given by the survival function:\n$$P(T_p > t) = \\exp(-k_p t)$$\n\nLet $T_c$ be the total time required for the EJC contact to form. According to the assumptions, this process has two stages:\n1.  A deterministic transport delay, $t_d$, required for the EJC to be clear of the steric occlusion zone. This is only relevant for $L \\ge L_0$. Per assumption (ii), this delay is $t_d = (L - L_0)/v$.\n2.  After this delay, the assembly of the decay-activating contact is a stochastic process with an exponential waiting time, say $T_{c,\\text{exp}} \\sim \\mathrm{Exp}(k_c)$, as per assumption (iii).\n\nThe total time for EJC contact is therefore $T_c = t_d + T_{c,\\text{exp}}$.\n\nThe problem is divided into two cases based on the distance $L$.\n\nCase 1: $L < L_0$.\nAccording to assumption (i), the EJC is within the steric occlusion zone and can never make productive contact. Therefore, NMD cannot be triggered. The probability of NMD in this case is zero.\n$$P_{\\mathrm{NMD}}(L) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } L < L_0$$\n\nCase 2: $L \\ge L_0$.\nAccording to assumption (v), NMD is triggered if and only if the EJC contact occurs before protective remodeling, i.e., if $T_c < T_p$.\nFor NMD to occur, two independent conditions must be met:\n1.  Protective remodeling must not occur during the deterministic transport delay $t_d$. The probability of this is $P(T_p > t_d) = \\exp(-k_p t_d)$.\n2.  Given that remodeling has not occurred by time $t_d$, a race begins at $t=t_d$ between the EJC contact process (rate $k_c$) and the protective remodeling process (rate $k_p$). The EJC contact process must \"win\" this race. For two independent exponential processes with rates $k_c$ and $k_p$, the probability that the first process occurs before the second is given by the ratio of its rate to the sum of the rates. Thus, the probability that EJC contact wins this race is $\\frac{k_c}{k_c + k_p}$.\n\nSince these two conditions are independent, the total probability of NMD is their product:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{NMD}}(L) = P(T_p > t_d) \\times P(\\text{contact wins race}) = \\exp(-k_p t_d) \\times \\frac{k_c}{k_c + k_p}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $t_d = (L - L_0)/v$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{NMD}}(L) = \\frac{k_c}{k_c + k_p} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_p(L - L_0)}{v}\\right) \\quad \\text{for } L \\ge L_0$$\n\nCombining both cases, the complete closed-form expression for $P_{\\mathrm{NMD}}(L)$ is:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{NMD}}(L) = \n\\begin{cases} \n0 & \\text{if } L < L_0 \\\\\n\\frac{k_c}{k_c + k_p} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_p(L - L_0)}{v}\\right) & \\text{if } L \\ge L_0 \n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Expected Fraction of NMD, $E$**\n\nWe are asked to compute $E = f_A P_{\\mathrm{NMD}}(L_A) + f_B P_{\\mathrm{NMD}}(L_B) + f_C P_{\\mathrm{NMD}}(\\text{no EJC})$ using the given parameters: $L_0 = 50$, $v = 100$, $k_c = 0.60$, $k_p = 0.30$, $f_A = 0.50$, $f_B = 0.30$, $f_C = 0.20$, $L_A = 80$, $L_B = 200$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the common pre-factor:\n$$\\frac{k_c}{k_c + k_p} = \\frac{0.60}{0.60 + 0.30} = \\frac{0.60}{0.90} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the NMD probability for each isoform.\n\nFor Isoform A:\n$L_A = 80$.

For this condition to be met, the term with the positive exponent must be zero, as $\\exp(x/\\lambda)$ grows without bound as $x \\to \\infty$. Therefore, we must have $A_1 = 0$. The solution simplifies to:\n$$\nC(x) = A_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\nThe second boundary condition is a localized flux at the source, $x=0$. The morphogen flux $J(x)$ is given by Fick's first law:\n$$\nJ(x) = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}\n$$\nSubstituting our solution for $C(x)$, we find the derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dx} = -\\frac{A_2}{\\lambda} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\nAnd the flux is:\n$$\nJ(x) = -D \\left(-\\frac{A_2}{\\lambda} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{D A_2}{\\lambda} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\nAt the boundary $x=0$, this flux must equal the effective secreted flux, $J_{\\text{eff}}$, which is given as $J_{\\text{eff}} = f \\cdot r_{\\text{trans}}$.\n$$\nJ(0) = \\frac{D A_2}{\\lambda} = J_{\\text{eff}}\n$$\nWe can solve for the constant $A_2$:\n$$\nA_2 = \\frac{J_{\\text{eff}} \\lambda}{D}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $C(x)$, we obtain the specific solution for the steady-state concentration profile:\n$$\nC(x) = \\frac{J_{\\text{eff}} \\lambda}{D} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\nBy substituting $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$ and $J_{\\text{eff}} = f \\cdot r_{\\text{trans}}$, the equation becomes:\n$$\nC(x) = \\frac{f \\cdot r_{\\text{trans}} \\sqrt{D/k}}{D} \\exp\\left(-x \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right) = \\frac{f \\cdot r_{\\text{trans}}}{\\sqrt{Dk}} \\exp\\left(-x \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)\n$$\nWe are required to find the translation rate $r_{\\text{trans}}$ such that the concentration at position $x=L$ is $C(L) = C^{*}$.\n$$\nC^{*} = \\frac{f \\cdot r_{\\text{trans}}}{\\sqrt{Dk}} \\exp\\left(-L \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for $r_{\\text{trans}}$, we get the symbolic expression:\n$$\nr_{\\text{trans}} = \\frac{C^{*} \\sqrt{Dk}}{f} \\exp\\left(L \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)\n$$\nBefore substituting the numerical values, we must ensure consistent units. The desired unit for $r_{\\text{trans}}$ is molecules per square micrometer per second (molecules $\\cdot \\text{μm}^{-2} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$). The given concentration $C^{*}$ is in nanomolar ($4 \\text{ nM}$).
