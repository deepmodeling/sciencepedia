Because parental haplotypes were phased, each informative RNA sequencing read overlapping a heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphism could be assigned unambiguously to maternal or paternal origin. For eight loci, the allele-specific read counts (after duplicate removal and bias correction) are as follows, written as paternal reads versus maternal reads:\n- Locus L1 (candidate): $10$ vs $2$.\n- Locus L2: $9$ vs $3$.\n- Locus L3: $8$ vs $4$.\n- Locus L4: $12$ vs $0$.\n- Locus L5: $7$ vs $5$.\n- Locus L6: $10$ vs $0$.\n- Locus L7: $11$ vs $3$.\n- Locus L8: $7$ vs $1$.\n\nAssume the following foundational framework:\n- For a non-imprinted locus with no parent-of-origin effect, the expected expression from maternal and paternal alleles is equal.

It provides a complete and consistent set of data and definitions, allowing for the calculation of a unique, meaningful solution. The methodology described—using a binomial test for allele-specific expression and the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for multiple testing correction—is standard practice in the field of genomics. Therefore, I will proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe objective is to compute the Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted $q$-value for locus L1. This requires a three-step procedure:\n1. For each of the $m=8$ loci, calculate the two-sided exact binomial p-value.\n2. Rank the calculated p-values in ascending order.\n3. Apply the Benjamini-Hochberg formula to determine the adjusted $q$-value for locus L1 based on its rank.\n\nStep 1: P-value Calculation\n\nFor each locus, we are given the paternal and maternal read counts. Let the paternal reads be $k$ and the total reads be $n$. The null hypothesis ($H_0$) is that there is no parent-of-origin expression bias, which corresponds to the probability of a read being paternal, $p$, being equal to $0.5$. The number of paternal reads $X$ is thus modeled by a binomial distribution, $X \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n, p=0.5)$.\n\nThe two-sided exact binomial p-value is the probability of observing a result at least as extreme as the one observed. For a count $k_{obs}$ out of $n$ trials, the p-value is the sum of probabilities of all outcomes $j$ that are no more likely than the observed outcome: $p = \\sum_{j: P(X=j) \\le P(X=k_{obs})} P(X=j)$. Given the symmetry of the binomial distribution when $p=0.5$, this simplifies. Let $k_{max} = \\max(k_{obs}, n-k_{obs})$.

By evaluating different strategies, you will appreciate why the reciprocal cross is the gold standard and learn to consider other key factors like biological replication, mapping bias, and appropriate statistical modeling.", "problem": "A developmental biologist aims to detect autosomal imprinted genes in mouse embryonic liver using allele-specific ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-seq). Two fully inbred strains, denoted A and B, have phased parental genomes with dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) catalogs. The experiment will generate first filial generation (F1) hybrids from reciprocal crosses, where in one cross the mother is A and the father is B, and in the other cross the mother is B and the father is A. The biologist must design the sampling, allele-specific mapping strategy, and statistical analysis, including thresholds for calling imprinting and the level of replication required to ensure robust discovery.\n\nUse the following fundamental bases to reason about the design:\n\n- The Central Dogma relates deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to ribonucleic acid (RNA) to protein; in the absence of imprinting and other allele-specific regulation, each autosomal allele in an F1 heterozygote contributes equally to messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), so under the null hypothesis the maternal and paternal allelic RNA-seq reads follow a binomial distribution with probability parameter $p=0.5$ for a read to map to either parental allele.\n- Mendelian inheritance implies that swapping the direction of the cross swaps the parental origin of each strain’s allele but not strain genotype itself, so consistent parent-of-origin biases across reciprocal F1 crosses distinguish imprinting from strain-specific expression differences.\n- RNA-seq read counts are subject to biological variability across individuals and technical variability (including reference mapping bias), which can be modeled at the gene level using a beta-binomial or generalized linear mixed model to account for overdispersion and replicate structure.\n- Multiple testing across many genes requires controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) to limit expected false positives.\n\nSuppose typical per-gene, per-sample coverage at informative SNPs is approximately $50$ reads, and allelic mapping can be made allele-aware by leveraging known phased SNPs. The biologist wants sufficient power to detect a parent-of-origin allelic skew on the order of 70:30 while maintaining a gene-level FDR of $0.05$.\n\nWhich option below specifies a valid experimental design and analysis plan that will reliably identify imprinted genes, controlling for strain effects and technical artifacts, while meeting reasonable statistical thresholds and replication needs?\n\nA. Perform a single-direction cross (A mother $\\times$ B father) with $n=3$ biological replicates from one litter, map reads to the standard reference genome, and for each gene pool all replicates to test for allelic imbalance using a binomial test with null $p=0.5$. Call imprinting if pooled maternal allelic ratio exceeds $0.60$ and the Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) is less than $0.05$.\n\nB. Perform reciprocal F1 crosses (A mother $\\times$ B father and B mother $\\times$ A father) with $n=6$ independent biological replicates per cross drawn from at least $4$ different litters, matched for embryonic day (E) $14.5$ and tissue. Balance fetal sex or include sex as a covariate. Construct a personalized diploid transcriptome using the phased parental genomes and perform allele-aware mapping with SNP masking and read-remapping to eliminate reference bias. For each gene in each sample require at least $20$ informative SNP-overlapping reads, and fit a gene-level beta-binomial generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with parent-of-origin as a fixed effect and sample as a random effect to account for overdispersion. Call a gene imprinted if: (i) the estimated parent-of-origin effect has the same direction in both reciprocal crosses (maternal or paternal) and the combined test yields FDR $\\leq 0.05$, (ii) the aggregated allelic ratio across replicates is at least $0.70$ in favor of the expected parental allele, and (iii) no evidence of mapping bias is detected in simulated balanced reads.

Perform reciprocal F1 crosses with $n=2$ biological replicates per cross. Map reads to the reference genome without SNP masking. Infer imprinting by comparing total (non-allele-specific) gene counts between the two cross directions using a negative binomial model (for example, DESeq2), and call genes with Benjamini–Hochberg FDR $<0.10$ as imprinted. As a secondary filter, require that the maternal allelic ratio pooled across all samples exceeds $0.60$.\n\nAnswer choices are mutually exclusive. Select the single best option.", "solution": "The goal is to design an experiment that isolates parent-of-origin effects while controlling for strain-specific expression differences and technical artifacts, and to set thresholds and replication that ensure robust statistical inference with adequate power and controlled false discovery rate (FDR).\n\nPrinciple-based derivation:\n\n- Definition of genomic imprinting: An imprinted gene is expressed preferentially from one parental allele due to epigenetic marks set in gametogenesis and maintained after fertilization. For autosomes, in an F1 hybrid without imprinting, each allele contributes equally to transcript abundance. Thus, under the null hypothesis $H_0$, the number of reads $K$ supporting the maternal allele out of $N$ allele-informative reads follows $K \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(N, p=0.5)$.\n- Reciprocal cross logic: Let strain A and strain B differ by SNPs that enable allele assignment. In cross A mother $\\times$ B father, the A-derived allele is maternal and the B-derived allele is paternal. In the reciprocal cross B mother $\\times$ A father, the A-derived allele is paternal and the B-derived allele is maternal. A true imprinted gene will show consistent parent-of-origin bias across both cross directions (e.g., maternal allele overexpressed in both), whereas a strain-specific effect will flip with strain but not with parent-of-origin, leading to opposite directional allelic biases across crosses and thus cancellation under a parent-of-origin contrast.\n- Statistical model: RNA-seq counts show extra-binomial variation due to biological heterogeneity and technical noise. A beta-binomial model, or a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with a logit link and a beta-binomial likelihood, accommodates overdispersion by allowing the success probability to vary across samples. Let $K_{gs}$ be maternal counts for gene $g$ in sample $s$, $N_{gs}$ the total allele-informative counts, and let $PO_{s}$ be a binary indicator for whether the maternal allele corresponds to a specified parent-of-origin (e.g., $PO_s=1$ if the maternal allele is expected to be overexpressed under imprinting). The model can estimate a fixed effect $\\beta_{PO,g}$ for parent-of-origin, with random intercepts per sample to capture overdispersion. A hypothesis test on $\\beta_{PO,g}=0$ across reciprocal crosses tests imprinting.\n- Mapping bias control: Mapping allele-specific reads to a single reference can introduce bias because reference-matching alleles map more efficiently. Using phased genomes to construct a personalized diploid transcriptome, SNP masking, and read-remapping removes preferential alignment, thereby enforcing the null expectation $p=0.5$ under no imprinting.\n- Replication and power: Consider a gene with true parent-of-origin imbalance $p=0.7$ vs $0.3$. With $n_r=6$ biological replicates per cross and approximate per-sample allele-informative coverage $c=50$ reads, the aggregated counts per cross are $N \\approx 6 \\times 50 = 300$. Under the null $p_0=0.5$, the standard deviation of $K$ is $\\sqrt{N p_0 (1-p_0)}=\\sqrt{300 \\times 0.5 \\times 0.5}=\\sqrt{75} \\approx 8.66$. Under the alternative $p_1=0.7$, the expected maternal counts are $E[K]=N p_1=210$, which is $60$ greater than the null mean $N p_0=150$, corresponding to a standardized difference of approximately $60/8.66 \\approx 6.93$ standard deviations for binomial counts. Accounting for overdispersion with a beta-binomial having overdispersion parameter $\\rho$, the variance inflates to $N p(1-p)\\left[1+\\rho (N-1)\\right]$. For a modest $\\rho=0.02$, the variance becomes $75 \\times \\left[1+0.02 \\times 299\\right] \\approx 75 \\times 6.98 \\approx 523.5$, with standard deviation $\\approx 22.9$, and the standardized difference is approximately $60/22.9 \\approx 2.62$, still yielding strong power at gene-level significance thresholds. Thus, $n_r=6$ per cross with $c \\approx 50$ reads is reasonable for detecting a $70{:}30$ skew while allowing FDR control at $0.05$.\n- Multiple testing: Testing thousands of genes requires controlling FDR (e.g., Benjamini–Hochberg) at $0.05$. Adding an effect-size threshold (e.g., aggregated allelic ratio $\\ge 0.70$) guards against calling minor allelic skews of limited biological relevance.\n\nWith these principles, evaluate each option:\n\nOption A:\n- Design flaws: Uses a single-direction cross only. This cannot distinguish imprinting from strain-specific expression because any allele-specific expression due to cis-regulatory variants will appear as a bias but will not be testable for parent-of-origin. No reciprocal cross means strain A bias would be misinterpreted as maternal bias.\n- Replication: Only $n=3$ biological replicates from one litter; litter effects and maternal environment confounders are not controlled. Pooling across replicates erases biological variability, leading to pseudoreplication.\n- Mapping: Maps to a single reference without allele-aware correction, introducing mapping bias toward the reference allele, violating the $p=0.5$ null.\n- Thresholds: FDR $<0.05$ and allelic ratio $>0.60$ are not sufficient to rescue the fundamental confounding. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption B:\n- Reciprocal crosses: Includes both A mother $\\times$ B father and B mother $\\times$ A father, enabling the parent-of-origin contrast that cancels strain effects.\n- Replication: $n=6$ independent biological replicates per cross across at least $4$ litters provides robustness to litter and maternal environment effects, and sufficient power given the coverage assumptions and the $70{:}30$ target effect.\n- Mapping: Uses phased parental genomes to construct a personalized diploid transcriptome and allele-aware mapping with SNP masking and remapping to remove reference bias; this preserves the $p=0.5$ null under no imprinting.\n- Modeling: Uses a gene-level beta-binomial GLMM with parent-of-origin as a fixed effect and sample as a random effect, appropriately capturing overdispersion and replicate structure across reciprocal crosses.\n- Thresholds: Requires consistent direction across reciprocal crosses, FDR $\\le 0.05$, an effect-size threshold (aggregated allelic ratio $\\ge 0.70$), and bias diagnostics; excludes sex chromosome genes unless sex is modeled, which avoids sex-related confounding.\n- Scientific realism: Matches first-principles reasoning and the power analysis indicating adequacy of $n=6$ with $c \\approx 50$. Verdict: Correct.\n\nOption C:\n- Replication: Pools all embryos per cross and yields $n=1$ library per cross, eliminating biological replication. Without replicates, between-individual variability and overdispersion cannot be estimated, and results are vulnerable to batch and litter effects.\n- Mapping: Does not use phased mapping; mapping to a single reference risks alignment bias.\n- Statistical test: Fisher’s exact test on pooled counts ignores overdispersion and sample structure. A lenient effect threshold ($>0.55$) combined with no replication increases false positives; a stringent $p<0.01$ without FDR control across genes is insufficient for genome-wide testing.\n- Although reciprocal structure is present, the lack of replication and mapping bias control renders the design inadequate. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption D:\n- Replication: $n=2$ per cross is underpowered and insufficient to characterize overdispersion reliably.\n- Mapping: No allele-aware mapping or SNP masking, so reference bias persists.\n- Modeling: Uses total (non-allele-specific) counts between cross directions. Differences in total expression between A mother $\\times$ B father and B mother $\\times$ A father do not directly test parent-of-origin allelic imbalance and can be driven by maternal environment, mitochondrial contributions, or strain-by-parent interactions unrelated to imprinting. The secondary filter uses pooled allelic ratios but after the primary screen has already selected genes by an irrelevant criterion.\n- Thresholds: FDR $<0.10$ is comparatively lenient, and the methodological mismatch leads to misclassification. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, only Option B satisfies the reciprocal design, allele-aware mapping, appropriate modeling, adequate replication, and stringent yet realistic thresholds necessary for robust detection of imprinted genes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2640796"}, {"introduction": "Beyond identifying imprinted genes, a primary goal is to understand their underlying molecular mechanisms.

The ICR lies between the protein-coding gene *Igf2* and the long noncoding RNA *H19* and includes a cluster of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) sites. On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated and bound by CTCF; on the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and does not recruit CTCF. Two flanking architectural CTCF sites act as domain boundaries: an upstream boundary whose consensus motif is oriented $\\rightarrow$ (pointing toward the ICR) and a downstream boundary whose consensus motif is oriented $\\leftarrow$ (pointing toward the ICR). The ICR harbors $4$ CTCF motifs that, in the wild type, are oriented $\\rightarrow$ (toward the downstream boundary). Enhancers that drive *Igf2* and *H19* reside $\\approx 120\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ downstream of the ICR. In the wild type, the downstream enhancers contact *H19* on the maternal allele and *Igf2* on the paternal allele. This maternal-versus-paternal asymmetry is classically explained by the loop extrusion model: cohesin extrudes chromatin until halted by convergently oriented CTCF sites; the maternal ICR acts as an insulator, while the paternal ICR does not.\n\nA CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)-mediated editing strategy is designed to invert by $180^\\circ$ the $\\approx 2\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ ICR segment containing the $4$ CTCF motifs, without altering its sequence content, methylation state, or position. The edit is introduced specifically into the maternal germline, so that embryos carry the inversion only on the maternal allele; the paternal allele remains wild type. All other features of the locus are unchanged. Assume the following well-tested principles as the foundational base for your reasoning:\n- The Central Dogma (DNA to RNA to protein) connects chromatin structure to gene expression via transcriptional output.\n- Genomic imprinting is established by parent-of-origin-specific DNA methylation at ICRs; methylation at CTCF motifs prevents CTCF binding, whereas unmethylated motifs recruit CTCF.\n- In the loop extrusion model, stable boundaries are most effectively formed by CTCF sites in convergent orientation; non-convergent CTCF pairs are poor stoppers for cohesin and therefore weak insulators.\n- Enhancer-promoter communication is constrained by loop boundaries and subject to promoter competition within a loop.\n\nBased solely on these principles, predict the most likely combined consequences of the maternal ICR inversion for allele-specific chromatin looping and gene expression at *Igf2* and *H19*. Which option best captures the expected outcome measured by allele-specific chromosome conformation capture (3C, including Hi-C) and RNA levels?\n\nA. On the maternal allele, inverting the ICR reverses the $4$ CTCF motifs to $\\leftarrow$, breaking convergence with the downstream boundary ($\\leftarrow$) and creating convergence with the upstream boundary ($\\rightarrow$). This redirects the stable loop to form between the inverted ICR and the upstream boundary, sequestering *H19* away from the downstream enhancers. Maternal enhancer–*Igf2* contacts increase and enhancer–*H19* contacts decrease; *Igf2* becomes biallelically expressed and *H19* is reduced on the maternal allele. The paternal allele is unchanged.\n\nB. CTCF-mediated insulation is orientation-independent; therefore, maternal insulation is preserved after inversion. Enhancer targeting and expression remain monoallelic as in wild type, with *Igf2* expressed only paternally and *H19* expressed only maternally.\n\nC. The inverted maternal ICR acts in trans to insulate the paternal allele, reducing paternal enhancer–*Igf2* contacts and silencing paternal *Igf2*. Maternal contacts and expression remain as in wild type, with increased *H19* expression due to strengthened insulation.\n\nD. Inversion of the maternal ICR abrogates methylation sensitivity of CTCF, enabling CTCF binding paternally despite methylation.

Therefore, the problem is valid and can be solved through logical application of these principles.\n\nThe solution requires a step-by-step analysis of the chromatin architecture and its consequences for gene expression, first in the wild-type condition and then in the experimental condition with the inverted Imprinting Control Region (ICR).\n\n**1. Wild-Type (WT) Locus Analysis**\n\nThe genomic locus is organized as follows, from upstream to downstream: Upstream Boundary (UB, with a CTCF site oriented $\\rightarrow$) ... *Igf2* gene ... ICR (with 4 CTCF sites) ... *H19* gene ... Downstream Boundary (DB, with a CTCF site oriented $\\leftarrow$) ... Enhancers (E).\n\n*   **Maternal Allele (WT)**:\n    *   The ICR is unmethylated, allowing the CTCF protein to bind to its 4 sites, which are oriented $\\rightarrow$ (Principle 2).\n    *   According to the loop extrusion model (Principle 3), the convergently oriented CTCF sites at the ICR ($\\rightarrow$) and the downstream boundary DB ($\\leftarrow$) form a stable chromatin loop. This loop is detected by chromosome conformation capture (3C) methods as an increased interaction frequency between the ICR and the DB.\n    *   This loop contains the *H19* gene. The ICR at the base of this loop functions as an insulator, blocking the downstream enhancers (E) from physically interacting with the *Igf2* promoter, which lies upstream of the ICR.\n    *   Therefore, on the maternal allele, the enhancers activate *H19*, while *Igf2* is silenced. The expression pattern is *Igf2* OFF, *H19* ON.\n\n*   **Paternal Allele (WT)**:\n    *   The ICR is methylated. This epigenetic mark prevents CTCF from binding (Principle 2).\n    *   Without CTCF binding, the ICR does not function as an insulator or a boundary for loop extrusion.\n    *   The absence of the insulator at the ICR allows the enhancers (E) to scan the chromatin domain and interact with both the *Igf2* and *H19* promoters.\n    *   The problem implies, and it is a known feature of this locus, that in this situation of promoter competition, the *Igf2* promoter is preferentially activated by the enhancers (Principle 4).\n    *   Therefore, on the paternal allele, *Igf2* is expressed, and *H19* is silenced. The expression pattern is *Igf2* ON, *H19* OFF.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Maternal Allele with Inverted ICR**\n\nThe experiment introduces an inversion of the ICR specifically on the maternal allele. The paternal allele remains wild-type. The inversion flips the orientation of the 4 CTCF motifs within the ICR by $180^\\circ$, from $\\rightarrow$ to $\\leftarrow$. The ICR remains unmethylated, so CTCF will still bind.\n\n*   **New CTCF Site Pairings on the Inverted Maternal Allele**:\n    *   **ICR_inv-DB Interaction**: The inverted ICR sites (ICR_inv) are oriented $\\leftarrow$, and the DB site is also oriented $\\leftarrow$. This $\\leftarrow \\dots \\leftarrow$ arrangement is a tandem (non-convergent) orientation. According to Principle 3, this pair does not form a stable boundary and is a weak insulator. The original loop between ICR and DB is therefore abrogated.\n    *   **UB-ICR_inv Interaction**: The upstream boundary UB site is oriented $\\rightarrow$, and the ICR_inv sites are now oriented $\\leftarrow$. This $\\rightarrow \\dots \\leftarrow$ arrangement is a convergent orientation. According to Principle 3, this will form a new, stable chromatin loop between the UB and the inverted ICR.\n\n*   **Predicted Consequences for Chromatin Looping and Gene Expression**:\n    *   **Chromatin Conformation (3C)**: 3C-based assays would show a loss of the WT maternal-specific interaction between the ICR and DB. A new, strong interaction would appear between the UB and the ICR_inv. This new loop sequesters the *Igf2* gene.\n    *   **Enhancer-Promoter Communication and Expression (RNA levels)**: The disruption of the ICR-DB loop eliminates the specific chromatin architecture that facilitates enhancer-*H19* communication on the maternal allele. Simultaneously, the insulating function of the ICR between *Igf2* and the enhancers is lost because the crucial ICR-DB boundary is gone. The entire region from the UB to beyond the enhancers can now be considered a single regulatory domain, similar to the paternal allele. Cohesin extrusion can now position the enhancers to interact with both promoters. Given the principle of promoter competition, the *Igf2* promoter will now be activated by the enhancers, and *H19* will be repressed.\n    *   **Summary of Outcome on the Inverted Maternal Allele**: Chromatin looping is rewired. *Igf2* becomes expressed and *H19* is silenced.\n    *   **Overall Allelic Expression**: Since the paternal allele expresses *Igf2* and silences *H19*, and the modified maternal allele now does the same, *Igf2* expression becomes biallelic. *H19*, which was only expressed from the maternal allele, will see its expression greatly reduced or eliminated.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. On the maternal allele, inverting the ICR reverses the $4$ CTCF motifs to $\\leftarrow$, breaking convergence with the downstream boundary ($\\leftarrow$) and creating convergence with the upstream boundary ($\\rightarrow$). This redirects the stable loop to form between the inverted ICR and the upstream boundary, sequestering *H19* away from the downstream enhancers. Maternal enhancer–*Igf2* contacts increase and enhancer–*H19* contacts decrease; *Igf2* becomes biallelically expressed and *H19* is reduced on the maternal allele. The paternal allele is unchanged.**\n    This option correctly identifies the change in CTCF motif orientation and the resulting change in convergent pairs. It correctly predicts the formation of a new loop between the UB and ICR_inv. The phrase \"sequestering *H19* away from the downstream enhancers\" correctly captures the consequence of breaking the original ICR-DB loop, which was necessary for enhancer-*H19* communication. The predicted consequences—increased enhancer-*Igf2* contacts, decreased enhancer-*H19* contacts, biallelic *Igf2* expression, and reduced *H19* expression—are all consistent with our derivation. The statement that the paternal allele is unchanged is also correct. This option provides a complete and accurate description of the expected outcome.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. CTCF-mediated insulation is orientation-independent; therefore, maternal insulation is preserved after inversion. Enhancer targeting and expression remain monoallelic as in wild type, with *Igf2* expressed only paternally and *H19* expressed only maternally.**\n    This option is fundamentally flawed. It begins with the premise that CTCF action is orientation-independent, which directly contradicts the provided Principle 3 stating that stable boundaries require **convergent** orientation. The entire modern understanding of the loop extrusion model is predicated on this orientation dependence.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. The inverted maternal ICR acts in trans to insulate the paternal allele, reducing paternal enhancer–*Igf2* contacts and silencing paternal *Igf2*. Maternal contacts and expression remain as in wild type, with increased *H19* expression due to strengthened insulation.**\n    This option incorrectly proposes a `trans`-acting effect, where the modified maternal chromosome affects the wild-type paternal chromosome. Chromatin looping and enhancer-promoter regulation are overwhelmingly `cis`-acting phenomena. No principle provided supports such a mechanism. Furthermore, it incorrectly claims that maternal expression remains as in wild type, which ignores the critical change in CTCF orientation and its consequences for looping as dictated by Principle 3.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Inversion of the maternal ICR abrogates methylation sensitivity of CTCF, enabling CTCF binding paternally despite methylation. Stable insulation forms on both alleles, leading to loss of *Igf2* expression and increased *H19* expression on both alleles.**\n    This option invents a biological effect not supported by the problem statement. The problem explicitly states the inversion does not alter \"sequence content, methylation state, or position\". There is no reason to assume the inversion would change a fundamental property of the CTCF protein or its binding site, such as its sensitivity to DNA methylation. The option also misinterprets the experiment, as the inversion is only on the maternal allele; the paternal allele is wild-type and does not contain the inverted ICR.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on a rigorous application of the provided principles, Option A is the only one that correctly predicts the consequences of the maternal ICR inversion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2640833"}]}
