Consider an early embryonic stage when each cell independently selects which parental X chromosome to inactivate by a molecularly stochastic process (for example, coating by X-inactive specific transcript and associated chromatin remodeling), after which the chosen inactive state is mitotically heritable. This heritable, cell-autonomous choice is the developmental basis for cellular mosaicism in XX individuals for X-linked alleles.\n\nLet $p \\in (0,1)$ denote the probability that a given cell inactivates the maternal X chromosome (that is, has maternal $X$ inactive, denoted maternal $X_{i}$).

It is a direct application of fundamental principles of probability theory to a simplified but valid model of a biological process, specifically X-chromosome inactivation. All necessary information is provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities. Thus, the problem is valid, and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe task is to derive the variance of the fraction of cells with an inactivated maternal X chromosome, denoted $F_N$. We are given a sample of $N$ clonally unrelated cells, where the choice of X-chromosome inactivation for each cell is an independent and identically distributed stochastic event.\n\nLet us define an indicator random variable $X_i$ for each cell $i$, where $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$.\nLet $X_i = 1$ if cell $i$ inactivates the maternal X chromosome, and $X_i = 0$ otherwise (i.e., it inactivates the paternal X chromosome).\nThe problem states that the probability of maternal X-inactivation is $p$. Thus, for any cell $i$:\n$$P(X_i = 1) = p$$\n$$P(X_i = 0) = 1-p$$\nEach $X_i$ is therefore a Bernoulli random variable with parameter $p$. The given conditions state that the variables $X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_N$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).\n\nFirst, we must determine the expectation and variance of a single such random variable, $X_i$.\nThe expectation, $E[X_i]$, is calculated as:\n$$E[X_i] = 1 \\cdot P(X_i = 1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_i = 0) = 1 \\cdot p + 0 \\cdot (1-p) = p$$\nThe variance, $\\mathrm{Var}(X_i)$, is given by the formula $\\mathrm{Var}(X_i) = E[X_i^2] - (E[X_i])^2$.\nTo find $E[X_i^2]$, we note that since $X_i$ can only be $0$ or $1$, $X_i^2$ is identical to $X_i$.\nTherefore, $E[X_i^2] = E[X_i] = p$.\nSubstituting this into the variance formula:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(X_i) = p - p^2 = p(1-p)$$\n\nThe random variable $F_N$ is defined as the *fraction* of cells in the sample with maternal X inactivation. Let $S_N$ be the total *number* of such cells. $S_N$ is the sum of the indicator variables:\n$$S_N = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$$\nThe fraction $F_N$ is then related to $S_N$ and the total number of cells $N$ as:\n$$F_N = \\frac{S_N}{N} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$$\n\nWe are required to find $\\mathrm{Var}(F_N)$. Using the properties of variance, specifically that $\\mathrm{Var}(aY) = a^2 \\mathrm{Var}(Y)$ for a constant $a$ and a random variable $Y$, we have:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(F_N) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{N} S_N\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(S_N) = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right)$$\n\nThe next step is to compute $\\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right)$. A critical property of variance is that for a sum of *independent* random variables, the variance of the sum is the sum of their individual variances. The problem explicitly states that the XCI choices are independent. Therefore:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathrm{Var}(X_i)$$\nSince the variables $X_i$ are also identically distributed, their variances are equal: $\\mathrm{Var}(X_i) = p(1-p)$ for all $i$.\nThe sum of the variances is then:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathrm{Var}(X_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p(1-p) = Np(1-p)$$\nThis is the well-known variance of the binomial distribution, as $S_N$ is binomially distributed with parameters $N$ and $p$.\n\nFinally, we substitute this result back into the expression for $\\mathrm{Var}(F_N)$:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(F_N) = \\frac{1}{N^2} [Np(1-p)]$$\nBy canceling a factor of $N$ from the numerator and denominator, we arrive at the final closed-form expression:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(F_N) = \\frac{p(1-p)}{N}$$\nThis result is the variance of the sample proportion, a fundamental quantity in statistical inference. It demonstrates that the variability of the fraction of cells with a particular epigenetic state decreases inversely with the number of cells in the sample.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{p(1-p)}{N}}$$", "id": "2687904"}, {"introduction": "Having established the statistical nature of mosaicism, we now delve into the molecular \"decision-making\" process itself.

This choice is a stochastic event. Consider a simplified model for the initiation of XCI in a single diploid female cell.

The binding and unbinding of the repressor is a rapid process that reaches equilibrium quickly. The amount of bound repressor $p_i$ is related to the amount of free repressor $p_{free}$ and the local _Xist_ RNA concentration $r_i$ by the following relationship:\n$$ p_i = \\frac{p_{free}}{K_D (1 + \\beta r_i^2)} $$\nwhere $K_D$ is the intrinsic dissociation constant of the repressor from the promoter, and $\\beta$ is the feedback strength parameter.\n\nInitially, the system is in an unstable symmetric state with low _Xist_ expression from both chromosomes. Stochastic fluctuations eventually drive the system to a stable, asymmetric steady state.

Assume that the mutant allele resides on the X chromosome that is active in a proportion $0.2$ of cells.\n\nThe gene _G_ partially escapes XCI in a cell-type specific manner as follows: in any cell where a given _G_ allele lies on the inactive X chromosome, with probability $e$ it is transcribed at a fraction $\\alpha$ of the level it would have if it were on the active X chromosome, and with probability $1-e$ it is fully silenced.

X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) establishes a stable mosaic: each cell has one transcriptionally active X chromosome and one transcriptionally inactive X chromosome.

By the problem’s skewing, we will later set $p = \\tfrac{1}{5}$, but we first proceed symbolically.\n\nDefine the detection threshold $\\delta$ for the mutant transcript relative to an active-X level.

In such a cell, the mutant allele is expressed at full active-X level, which is $\\geq \\delta$ for any $\\delta \\leq 1$, and in particular for any $\\delta \\in (0,1]$ as is typical for a detection threshold. Therefore, conditional on the mutant-bearing X being active, the probability of being called “expressing the mutant allele” is $1$.\n\n- With probability $1-p$, the mutant-bearing X is inactive. In such a cell, the mutant allele is expressed at level $\\alpha$ with probability $e$ and at level $0$ with probability $1-e$.

Since $\\alpha = \\tfrac{1}{5} = \\tfrac{4}{20}$ exceeds $\\tau = \\tfrac{3}{20}$, cells in which the wild-type allele escapes are phenotypically nonmutant, whereas those without escape are phenotypically mutant. Therefore, the fraction of phenotypically mutant cells among the $p$ fraction is $p(1-e) = \\tfrac{1}{5}\\cdot \\tfrac{1}{2} = \\tfrac{1}{10}$. In cells where the mutant-bearing X is inactive (probability $1-p = \\tfrac{4}{5}$), the wild-type allele is on the active X, giving functional dosage $1$, which is above $\\tau$, so these cells are phenotypically nonmutant. Hence, the expected mutant-phenotype fraction across the tissue is $\\tfrac{1}{10}$. By the law of large numbers, in a very large tissue this realized fraction will concentrate near $\\tfrac{1}{10}$, which is below the disease threshold $\\theta = \\tfrac{3}{10}$.
