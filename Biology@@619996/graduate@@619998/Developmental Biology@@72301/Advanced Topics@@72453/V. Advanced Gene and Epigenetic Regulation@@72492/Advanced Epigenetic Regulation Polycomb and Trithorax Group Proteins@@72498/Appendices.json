This recognition allosterically stimulates the Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 ($\\mathrm{EZH2}$) methyltransferase. This establishes a local reader–writer positive feedback loop.\n4.  **Function of Feedback**: This feedback supports spreading of $\\mathrm{H3K27me3}$ from nucleation sites and its maintenance after DNA replication.\n5.  **Replication Effect**: During S phase, parental histones are redistributed, with approximately half ($\\theta \\approx 0.5$) of modified histones inherited per daughter chromatid.\n6.  **Maintenance Requirement**: Restoration of pre-replication levels requires efficient maintenance methylation each cell cycle.\n7.  **Differentiation Effect**: Differentiation introduces antagonism to Polycomb domains via transcription-coupled chromatin remodeling and increased exposure to demethylases (KDM6A, KDM6B).\n8.  **Experimental Perturbation**: A CRISPR-engineered cell line has an $\\mathrm{EED}$ aromatic cage mutation.\n9.  **Effect of Mutation**: The mutation specifically abolishes binding to $\\mathrm{H3K27me3}$. It leaves basal $\\mathrm{PRC2}$ catalytic activity, core complex integrity, and nucleation-site recruitment (via cofactors like $\\mathrm{JARID2}$ and $\\mathrm{AEBP2}$) intact.\n10. **Constant Conditions**: Demethylase expression and activity are unchanged between mutant and wild-type lines.\n11. **Foundational Fact 1**: Positive feedback via reader–writer coupling increases the effective local methylation rate where the mark exists, promoting lateral reinforcement.\n12. **Foundational Fact 2**: Without this coupling, the effective methylation rate is limited to basal levels at recruitment sites, and spreading away from nucleation sites is reduced.\n13. **Foundational Fact 3**: Replication dilutes marks ($\\theta \\approx 0.5$). If the maintenance rate $k_{\\mathrm{maint}}$ is low relative to loss and antagonism, the fraction of modified nucleosomes $f$ decays over cell cycles.\n14. **Foundational Fact 4**: Differentiation increases transcriptional antagonism to $\\mathrm{PRC2}$ and increases the effective loss rate of $\\mathrm{H3K27me3}$.\n15. **Question**: Predict the impact of the $\\mathrm{EED}$ aromatic cage mutant on both the size and stability of $\\mathrm{H3K27me3}$ domains in differentiating cells.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes the canonical model of Polycomb regulation, which is a core concept in developmental biology and epigenetics. The roles of $\\mathrm{PRC2}$, $\\mathrm{EED}$, $\\mathrm{EZH2}$, $\\mathrm{H3K27me3}$, and their interplay are factually correct and based on established scientific literature.\n*   **Well-Posed**: The problem sets up a clear scenario (wild-type vs. specific mutant) and asks for a logical prediction based on specified rules (\"foundational facts\"). The perturbation is well-defined, and the question points to a unique deductive outcome.\n*   **Objective**: The language is technical and unbiased.\n*   **Complete and Consistent**: The problem provides all necessary information. The effects of the mutation are explicitly stated (loss of reader function, preservation of basal activity and recruitment), and the provided \"foundational facts\" act as the axioms for solving the problem. There are no internal contradictions. For instance, the mutation abolishes the allosteric stimulation described in the wild-type mechanism, and Foundational Fact 2 correctly describes the consequence of this loss.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formulated question in molecular and developmental biology that requires logical deduction from a set of established principles. The solution will proceed.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe problem asks to predict the effect of the $\\mathrm{EED}$ aromatic cage mutation on two properties of $\\mathrm{H3K27me3}$ domains in differentiating cells: 1) genomic size/span, and 2) stability/persistence over cell divisions.\n\n1.  **Impact on Domain Size (Span)**\n    The wild-type mechanism involves a reader-writer positive feedback loop where $\\mathrm{EED}$ binds to existing $\\mathrm{H3K27me3}$ and stimulates the $\\mathrm{EZH2}$ methyltransferase. Foundational Fact 1 states this feedback \"promot[es] lateral reinforcement of domains\", which is synonymous with spreading of the mark from its initial nucleation sites.\n    The mutation \"specifically abolishes binding to $\\mathrm{H3K27me3}$\", thereby breaking the reader-writer feedback loop.\n    Foundational Fact 2 directly addresses this situation: \"In the absence of such coupling... spreading away from nucleation sites is reduced.\"\n    Therefore, the ability of $\\mathrm{PRC2}$ to methylate nucleosomes adjacent to an already-methylated one is lost. Methylation activity in the mutant is confined primarily to the regions where $\\mathrm{PRC2}$ is initially recruited by cofactors (like $\\mathrm{JARID2}$/$\\mathrm{AEBP2}$).\n    **Conclusion on Size**: Broad $\\mathrm{H3K27me3}$ domains, which rely on spreading, will fail to form or be maintained. Instead, the domains will shrink or \"contract\" to become narrow regions centered on the primary $\\mathrm{PRC2}$ recruitment/nucleation sites.\n\n2.  **Impact on Domain Stability (Persistence)**\n    Domain stability depends on the balance between histone mark deposition and its loss. Loss occurs through two primary mechanisms described: dilution during DNA replication and active removal (by demethylases) or antagonism (by transcription), which is heightened during differentiation (Foundational Fact 4). To counteract these losses, a maintenance methylation rate, $k_{\\mathrm{maint}}$, is required (Foundational Fact 3).\n    In wild-type cells, the allosteric stimulation of $\\mathrm{EZH2}$ by $\\mathrm{EED}$ provides a high effective $k_{\\mathrm{maint}}$. This allows the system to efficiently restore the $\\mathrm{H3K27me3}$ mark on newly incorporated nucleosomes following replication.\n    In the mutant, this allosteric stimulation is absent. The problem states that only \"basal $\\mathrm{PRC2}$ catalytic activity\" remains. This means $k_{\\mathrm{maint}}$ is significantly reduced.\n    According to Foundational Fact 3, if $k_{\\mathrm{maint}}$ is low relative to loss and antagonism, \"the fraction of modified nucleosomes $f$ decays over cell cycles.\"\n    The problem specifies that the cells are differentiating, a condition where antagonism and the effective loss rate are increased (Foundational Fact 4). The combination of a low maintenance rate (due to the mutation) and a high loss rate (due to differentiation) will lead to a net loss of the $\\mathrm{H3K27me3}$ mark with each cell division. This manifests as accelerated dilution and progressive erosion of the mark.\n    **Conclusion on Stability**: The stability of $\\mathrm{H3K27me3}$ domains will be severely compromised. The mark will not be properly maintained post-replication and will be progressively lost over successive cell divisions.\n\n**Combined Prediction**\nThe $\\mathrm{EED}$ aromatic cage mutant will cause $\\mathrm{H3K27me3}$ domains to contract into narrow regions around nucleation sites due to the loss of spreading. Concurrently, the domains will become unstable and erode over cell divisions due to a failure of maintenance methylation to overcome replication-coupled dilution and differentiation-associated antagonism.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. $\\mathrm{H3K27me3}$ domains fragment into narrow peaks at nucleation sites that remain long-term stable across cell divisions; global $\\mathrm{H3K27me3}$ levels are largely preserved because Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 ($\\mathrm{PRC1}$) compensates for the loss of EED binding.**\n    The first part, \"fragment into narrow peaks at nucleation sites,\" is consistent with the loss of spreading. However, the second part, \"remain long-term stable,\" is incorrect. Loss of the EED-mediated positive feedback cripples maintenance methylation, leading to instability, not stability. The final claim that $\\mathrm{PRC1}$ compensates is an unsubstantiated external assumption; the problem provides no basis for this, and it is not the canonical function of $\\mathrm{PRC1}$ to write $\\mathrm{H3K27me3}$.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **B. $\\mathrm{H3K27me3}$ domains contract toward nucleation-proximal regions due to loss of feedback-driven spreading, and their stability decreases during differentiation, showing accelerated post-replication dilution and erosion over successive divisions.**\n    This statement accurately captures both predicted consequences. \"Domains contract toward nucleation-proximal regions\" aligns with the conclusion on size. \"Their stability decreases... showing accelerated post-replication dilution and erosion\" aligns perfectly with the conclusion on stability.\n    Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n*   **C. $\\mathrm{H3K27me3}$ domains expand because boundary elements are no longer recognized without EED binding, and $\\mathrm{H3K27me3}$ becomes more stable since PRC2 catalytic activity is unaffected.**\n    The premise \"domains expand\" is the opposite of what is expected. Loss of a positive feedback for spreading should lead to contraction, not expansion. The claim that the mark \"becomes more stable\" is also false. While *basal* activity is intact, the *stimulated* activity required for robust maintenance is lost, leading to decreased stability.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. $\\mathrm{H3K27me3}$ domain size remains approximately unchanged because other chromodomain readers substitute for EED, although stability declines slightly due to a modest reduction in maintenance efficiency.**\n    The assertion that domain size is unchanged requires an assumption of functional redundancy (\"other chromodomain readers substitute\") which is not given in the problem statement. The problem emphasizes the specific role of the $\\mathrm{EED}$ aromatic cage, and its loss should have a significant effect on spreading. The claim that stability \"declines slightly\" likely underestimates the impact of losing the primary allosteric stimulation mechanism for $\\mathrm{EZH2}$. The reduction in maintenance efficiency should be severe, not modest.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **E. Initial establishment of $\\mathrm{H3K27me3}$ is unaffected, and maintenance is severely compromised only in pluripotent stem cells but remains robust after differentiation due to decreased antagonism by transcription.**\n    The first part about establishment is plausible. However, the second part contains a direct contradiction of the provided information. The problem explicitly states that differentiation \"introduces additional antagonism\" and \"increases the effective loss rate\" (Foundational Fact 4). Therefore, maintenance would become *less* robust upon differentiation, not more.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$"}, {"introduction": "The landscape of histone modifications is a dynamic equilibrium, shaped by the competing activities of enzymes that add (\"write\") and remove (\"erase\") marks.

With the given symmetric parameters $a=r=0.2$ and $K=0.5$, the system without external stimulus ($S(t)=0$) possesses two stable fixed points near $P=0$ (repressed state) and $P=1$ (active state), separated by an unstable fixed point at $P=0.5$.\n\nThe system is initialized in the basin of attraction of the repressed state, with $P(0)=0.1$. A transient stimulus pulse, $S(t)$, of amplitude $A$ and duration $\\tau$, is applied to simulate a temporary activation signal.\n$$\nS(t) = \\begin{cases} A & \\text{if } 0 \\le t < \\tau \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } t \\ge \\tau \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe computational task is to determine if this pulse is sufficient to drive the system across the unstable threshold ($P=0.5$), thereby \"flipping the switch\" to the active state, which would then be maintained long after the pulse has ended. We must compute the final state $P(T_{\\text{final}})$ at $T_{\\text{final}}=200\\ \\mathrm{h}$.\n\nThe problem is not solvable analytically due to the non-linear nature of the Hill functions. The solution must be obtained through numerical integration. The problem specifies the use of a stable and accurate method, for which the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method is an excellent choice. It offers high accuracy for a given step size and is standard for such problems.\n\nThe RK4 algorithm for an ODE $\\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t,y)$ approximates the solution at the next time step $t_{i+1} = t_i + h$ as follows:\n$$\ny_{i+1} = y_i + \\frac{h}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)\n$$\nwhere $h$ is the time step, and the coefficients are:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nk_1 &= f(t_i, y_i) \\\\\nk_2 &= f\\left(t_i + \\frac{h}{2}, y_i + \\frac{h}{2}k_1\\right) \\\\\nk_3 &= f\\left(t_i + \\frac{h}{2}, y_i + \\frac{h}{2}k_2\\right) \\\\\nk_4 &= f(t_i + h, y_i + h k_3)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nIn our case, $y$ corresponds to $P$ and $f(t,P)$ is the right-hand side of the governing ODE. The function $f$ must correctly evaluate the discontinuous stimulus term $S(t)$ based on the time argument provided at each stage of the RK4 calculation. A sufficiently small time step $h$ is chosen to ensure numerical stability and to accurately resolve the dynamics during the pulse.\n\nThe algorithm for each test case $(A, \\tau)$ is as follows:\n$1$. Initialize the state variables: $P = P(0) = 0.1$ and $t = 0$.\n$2$. Define a small time step, for instance, $h=0.01\\ \\mathrm{h}$.\n$3$. Iterate from $t=0$ to $T_{\\text{final}}$ in steps of $h$. In each step:\n    a. Calculate the next value of $P$ using one step of the RK4 algorithm. The ODE function $f(t,P)$ will use the current time $t$ to determine if the stimulus $S(t)=A$ or $S(t)=0$.\n    b. Enforce the physical constraint $P \\in [0,1]$ by clamping the newly computed value of $P$ to this interval. This prevents numerical artifacts from driving the solution outside its meaningful domain.\n$4$. The value of $P$ at the end of the integration at $T_{\\text{final}}$ is the result. This result is then rounded to $6$ decimal places as required.\n\nThis procedure is applied to all specified test cases, and the results are aggregated into the specified output format.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the problem for all test cases and print the final result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Fixed model parameters\n    a = 0.2         # Activation feedback strength (h^-1)\n    r = 0.2         # Repression feedback strength (h^-1)\n    n = 4           # Hill coefficient (dimensionless)\n    K = 0.5         # Half-saturation constant (dimensionless)\n    P0 = 0.1        # Initial active-state occupancy fraction (dimensionless)\n    T_final = 200.0 # Long-term evaluation time (h)\n\n    # Test suite: each case is a tuple (A, tau)\n    # A: pulse amplitude (h^-1), tau: pulse duration (h)\n    test_cases = [\n        (0.0, 10.0),   # Test 1\n        (0.15, 50.0),  # Test 2\n        (0.25, 10.0),  # Test 3\n        (0.4, 10.0),   # Test 4\n        (0.3, 30.0),   # Test 5\n        (1.0, 1.0),    # Test 6\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for A, tau in test_cases:\n        # Numerically solve the ODE for the current test case.\n        final_P = solve_ode_case(A, tau, P0, T_final, a, r, n, K)\n        # Round the result to 6 decimal places as required.\n        results.append(round(final_P, 6))\n\n    # Format the final output as a comma-separated list string.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\ndef hill_function(x, K, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Hill function H(x) = x^n / (K^n + x^n).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use np.power for robust exponentiation.\n    x_n = np.power(x, n)\n    K_n = np.power(K, n)\n    # Adding a small epsilon to the denominator is a safeguard against 0/0,\n    # though not strictly necessary with K=0.5.\n    return x_n / (K_n + x_n + 1e-12)\n\ndef ode_rhs(t, P, params):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the right-hand side of the ODE, dP/dt.\n    params is a dictionary containing all necessary parameters.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Unpack parameters\n    A, tau = params['A'], params['tau']\n    a, r, n, K = params['a'], params['r'], params['n'], params['K']\n    \n    # Determine the value of the stimulus S(t)\n    S_t = A if t < tau else 0.0\n    \n    # Calculate Hill function contributions\n    H_P = hill_function(P, K, n)\n    H_1_minus_P = hill_function(1.0 - P, K, n)\n    \n    # Calculate the derivative dP/dt\n    dP_dt = (S_t + a * H_P - r * H_1_minus_P) * P * (1.0 - P)\n    \n    return dP_dt\n\ndef solve_ode_case(A, tau, P0, T_final, a, r, n, K):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the ODE for a single test case using the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Numerical integration parameters\n    h = 0.01  # Time step in hours\n    num_steps = int(T_final / h)\n    \n    P = P0  # Initialize the active fraction\n    \n    # Pack parameters for passing to the ODE function\n    params = {'A': A, 'tau': tau, 'a': a, 'r': r, 'n': n, 'K': K}\n\n    # Time-stepping loop\n    for i in range(num_steps):\n        t = i * h\n        \n        # 4th-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) step\n        k1 = ode_rhs(t, P, params)\n        k2 = ode_rhs(t + 0.5 * h, P + 0.5 * h * k1, params)\n        k3 = ode_rhs(t + 0.5 * h, P + 0.5 * h * k2, params)\n        k4 = ode_rhs(t + h, P + h * k3, params)\n        \n        P += (h / 6.0) * (k1 + 2 * k2 + 2 * k3 + k4)\n        \n        # Clamp the value of P to the physical range [0, 1]\n        P = max(0.0, min(1.0, P))\n        \n    return P\n\n# Execute the solver\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n```"}]}
