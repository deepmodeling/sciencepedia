Estimation of Background Risk, $P_0$**\nThe background risk, $P_0$, is the probability of malformation in the absence of the teratogen ($d=0$). This is estimated from the control cohort data.\nGiven: For $d=0 \\, \\mathrm{mg/kg}$, sample size $N=200$ and malformed count $M=10$.\nThe point estimate for the background risk is the observed proportion:\n$$ P_0 = \\hat{P}(0) = \\frac{M}{N} = \\frac{10}{200} = 0.05 $$\n\n**2. Estimation of Hill Coefficient $n$ and $EC_{50}$**\nThe dose-response is described by a Hill-type model with a background risk $P_0$ and a maximum risk of $1$. The probability of malformation at dose $d$, $P(d)$, is given by:\n$$ P(d) = P_0 + (1 - P_0) \\frac{d^n}{EC_{50}^n + d^n} $$\nThe definition of extra risk, $r(d)$, is given as $r(d) = \\frac{P(d) - P_0}{1 - P_0}$. Substituting the expression for $P(d)$ into this definition yields:\n$$ r(d) = \\frac{\\left(P_0 + (1 - P_0) \\frac{d^n}{EC_{50}^n + d^n}\\right) - P_0}{1 - P_0} = \\frac{(1 - P_0) \\frac{d^n}{EC_{50}^n + d^n}}{1 - P_0} = \\frac{d^n}{EC_{50}^n + d^n} $$\nTo linearize this relationship, we rearrange the equation to isolate the dose term. This is known as the Hill plot transformation.\n$$ r(d)(EC_{50}^n + d^n) = d^n $$\n$$ r(d)EC_{50}^n = d^n(1 - r(d)) $$\n$$ \\frac{r(d)}{1 - r(d)} = \\left(\\frac{d}{EC_{50}}\\right)^n $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives a linear equation:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{r(d)}{1 - r(d)}\\right) = n \\ln(d) - n \\ln(EC_{50}) $$\nThis equation has the form $Y = mX + c$, where $Y = \\ln\\left(\\frac{r(d)}{1 - r(d)}\\right)$, $X = \\ln(d)$, the slope is $m=n$, and the y-intercept is $c = -n \\ln(EC_{50})$.\n\nWe now compute the $(X, Y)$ coordinates for the three nonzero dose groups, treating the observed risk $\\hat{P}(d)$ as the true risk $P(d)$.\n- For $d = 10 \\, \\mathrm{mg/kg}$: $\\hat{P}(10) = \\frac{24}{100} = 0.24$.\n  $r(10) = \\frac{0.24 - 0.05}{1 - 0.05} = \\frac{0.19}{0.95} = 0.2$.\n  $X_1 = \\ln(10)$.\n  $Y_1 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.2}{1 - 0.2}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.2}{0.8}\\right) = \\ln(0.25) = -\\ln(4)$.\n\n- For $d = 20 \\, \\mathrm{mg/kg}$: $\\hat{P}(20) = \\frac{21}{40} = 0.525$.\n  $r(20) = \\frac{0.525 - 0.05}{1 - 0.05} = \\frac{0.475}{0.95} = 0.5$.\n  $X_2 = \\ln(20)$.\n  $Y_2 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.5}{1 - 0.5}\\right) = \\ln(1) = 0$.\n\n- For $d = 40 \\, \\mathrm{mg/kg}$: $\\hat{P}(40) = \\frac{81}{100} = 0.81$.\n  $r(40) = \\frac{0.81 - 0.05}{1 - 0.05} = \\frac{0.76}{0.95} = 0.8$.\n  $X_3 = \\ln(40)$.\n  $Y_3 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.8}{1 - 0.8}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.8}{0.2}\\right) = \\ln(4)$.\n\nThe data points for linear fitting are $(\\ln(10), -\\ln(4))$, $(\\ln(20), 0)$, and $(\\ln(40), \\ln(4))$.

In the context of extra risk $r(d)$, which ranges from $0$ to $1$, the half-maximal response is $r(d)=0.5$. From our data, at $d=20$, $r(20)=0.5$. Therefore, the $EC_{50}$ is exactly $20 \\, \\mathrm{mg/kg}$.\nAlternatively, using the intercept from the linear fit: $c = -n \\ln(EC_{50})$.

To determine $C_m$, we solve this equation algebraically:\n$$R_{\\text{in}}(K_m + C_m) = V_{\\max} C_m$$\n$$R_{\\text{in}} K_m + R_{\\text{in}} C_m = V_{\\max} C_m$$\n$$R_{\\text{in}} K_m = (V_{\\max} - R_{\\text{in}}) C_m$$\n$$C_m = \\frac{R_{\\text{in}} K_m}{V_{\\max} - R_{\\text{in}}}$$\nThis equation is valid provided that $R_{\\text{in}} < V_{\\max}$, which ensures a finite, positive steady-state concentration exists.\n\nNext, we establish the parameters for our specific problem.\nThe allele frequencies are given as $q=0.2$ for the reduced-function allele $a$ and $p=1-q=0.8$ for the normal allele $A$. According to Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, the genotype frequencies are:\n- $AA$: $p^2 = (0.8)^2 = 0.64$\n- $Aa$: $2pq = 2(0.8)(0.2) = 0.32$\n- $aa$: $q^2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04$\n\nThe genotype-specific maximal elimination rates are:\n- $V_{\\max}^{AA} = V = 10$\n- $V_{\\max}^{Aa} = \\alpha V = 0.7 \\times 10 = 7$\n- $V_{\\max}^{aa} = \\beta V = 0.4 \\times 10 = 4$\nThe Michaelis constant is $K_m=5$ for all genotypes.\n\nTeratogenic risk is present if the fetal concentration $C_f$ exceeds the threshold $C^\\* = 2.5$. Given $C_f = f C_m$ with $f=0.8$, the risk condition is $0.8 C_m > 2.5$, which simplifies to a maternal concentration threshold of $C_m > \\frac{2.5}{0.8} = 3.125$.\n\nWe will now analyze each infusion regimen.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Low-Rate Regimen ($R_L = 2$)**\nWe calculate $C_m$ for each genotype using $R_{\\text{in}}=2$:\n- **Genotype AA ($V_{\\max}^{AA} = 10$)**:\n  $$C_m^{AA} = \\frac{2 \\times 5}{10 - 2} = \\frac{10}{8} = 1.25$$\n  Since $1.25 < 3.125$, there is no risk for this genotype.\n- **Genotype Aa ($V_{\\max}^{Aa} = 7$)**:\n  $$C_m^{Aa} = \\frac{2 \\times 5}{7 - 2} = \\frac{10}{5} = 2$$\n  Since $2 < 3.125$, there is no risk for this genotype.\n- **Genotype aa ($V_{\\max}^{aa} = 4$)**:\n  $$C_m^{aa} = \\frac{2 \\times 5}{4 - 2} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5$$\n  Since $5 > 3.125$, there is risk for this genotype.\n\nThe fraction of pregnancies at risk under regimen $R_L$ is the frequency of the at-risk genotype, which is only $aa$.\nFraction at risk = Freq($aa$) = $q^2 = 0.04$, or $4\\%$.\n\n**2. Analysis of the High-Rate Regimen ($R_H = 3.5$)**\nWe calculate $C_m$ for each genotype using $R_{\\text{in}}=3.5$:\n- **Genotype AA ($V_{\\max}^{AA} = 10$)**:\n  $$C_m^{AA} = \\frac{3.5 \\times 5}{10 - 3.5} = \\frac{17.5}{6.5} = \\frac{35}{13} \\approx 2.692$$\n  Since $2.692 < 3.125$, there is no risk for this genotype.\n- **Genotype Aa ($V_{\\max}^{Aa} = 7$)**:\n  $$C_m^{Aa} = \\frac{3.5 \\times 5}{7 - 3.5} = \\frac{17.5}{3.5} = 5$$\n  Since $5 > 3.125$, there is risk for this genotype.\n- **Genotype aa ($V_{\\max}^{aa} = 4$)**:\n  $$C_m^{aa} = \\frac{3.5 \\times 5}{4 - 3.5} = \\frac{17.5}{0.5} = 35$$\n  Since $35 > 3.125$, there is risk for this genotype.\n\nThe fraction of pregnancies at risk under regimen $R_H$ is the sum of the frequencies of the at-risk genotypes, $Aa$ and $aa$.\nFraction at risk = Freq($Aa$) + Freq($aa$) = $2pq + q^2 = 0.32 + 0.04 = 0.36$, or $36\\%$.\n\n**3. Fold-Increase in Population Mean Fetal Concentration**\nThe population mean fetal concentration $\\mathbb{E}[C_f]$ is equivalent to $f \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[C_m]$. The fold-increase is the ratio $\\frac{\\mathbb{E}[C_{f,H}]}{\\mathbb{E}[C_{f,L}]} = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[C_{m,H}]}{\\mathbb{E}[C_{m,L}]}$.\nWe compute the mean maternal concentration for each regimen, $\\mathbb{E}[C_m] = \\sum C_m^{\\text{genotype}} \\times \\text{Freq}(\\text{genotype})$.\n\n- **Mean maternal concentration for $R_L = 2$**:\n  $$\\mathbb{E}[C_{m,L}] = C_m^{AA} p^2 + C_m^{Aa} 2pq + C_m^{aa} q^2$$\n  $$\\mathbb{E}[C_{m,L}] = (1.25)(0.64) + (2)(0.32) + (5)(0.04) = 0.8 + 0.64 + 0.2 = 1.64$$\n\n- **Mean maternal concentration for $R_H = 3.5$**:\n  $$\\mathbb{E}[C_{m,H}] = C_m^{AA} p^2 + C_m^{Aa} 2pq + C_m^{aa} q^2$$\n  $$\\mathbb{E}[C_{m,H}] = \\left(\\frac{35}{13}\\right)(0.64) + (5)(0.32) + (35)(0.04)$$\n  $$\\mathbb{E}[C_{m,H}] = \\frac{22.4}{13} + 1.6 + 1.4 = \\frac{22.4}{13} + 3.0 = \\frac{22.4 + 39}{13} = \\frac{61.4}{13}$$\n\n- **Fold-increase**:\n  $$\\text{Fold-increase} = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[C_{m,H}]}{\\mathbb{E}[C_{m,L}]} = \\frac{61.4/13}{1.64} = \\frac{61.4}{13 \\times 1.64} = \\frac{61.4}{21.32} \\approx 2.8799$$\n  The fold-increase is approximately $2.88$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n- **A. Under $R_L$: $4\\%$ at risk; under $R_H$: $36\\%$ at risk; population mean fetal AUC increases by approximately $2.88$-fold.**\n  This statement matches all three of our derived results.\n  - Risk under $R_L$: $4\\%$. Correct.\n  - Risk under $R_H$: $36\\%$. Correct.\n  - Fold-increase: $\\approx 2.88$. Correct.\n  **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. Under $R_L$: $0\\%$ at risk; under $R_H$: $36\\%$ at risk; population mean fetal AUC increases by approximately $3.60$-fold.**\n  The risk under $R_L$ is calculated to be $4\\%$, not $0\\%$. The fold-increase is also incorrect.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. Under $R_L$: $36\\%$ at risk; under $R_H$: $64\\%$ at risk; population mean fetal AUC increases by greater than $10$-fold.**\n  The risk percentages are incorrect. $36\\%$ is the risk for $R_H$. $64\\%$ is the frequency of the $AA$ genotype, which is not at risk under either regimen. The fold-increase is drastically overestimated.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. Under $R_L$: $0\\%$ at risk; under $R_H$: $4\\%$ at risk; population mean fetal AUC increases by approximately $1.20$-fold.**\n  The risk percentages are incorrect. The risk under $R_L$ is $4\\%$, and under $R_H$ is $36\\%$. The fold-increase is also incorrect.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2679480"}]}
