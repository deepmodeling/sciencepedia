Ethanol exposure pertinent to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) elevates acetaldehyde, which can bind to the ALDH active site and competitively inhibit retinaldehyde oxidation. In contrast, thalidomide perturbs development through Cereblon (CRBN) E3 ubiquitin ligase–mediated substrate dysregulation and anti-angiogenic actions, not by directly altering RA enzymology. Focusing on the ethanol/acetaldehyde mechanism, consider a localized embryonic microdomain in which the retinaldehyde concentration remains effectively constant during the time window of interest.\n\nAssume the ALDH-catalyzed reaction obeys steady-state Michaelis–Menten kinetics and that acetaldehyde acts as a purely competitive inhibitor with inhibition constant $K_{i}$.

The uninhibited reaction rate, $v_0$, is therefore:\n$$\nv_0 = \\frac{V_{\\max} [\\mathrm{RetA}]}{K_m + [\\mathrm{RetA}]}\n$$\nAcetaldehyde, $[\\mathrm{Acet}]$, acts as a competitive inhibitor. In competitive inhibition, the inhibitor binds to the enzyme's active site, competing with the substrate. This type of inhibition increases the apparent Michaelis constant, $K_{m}^{\\text{app}}$, but does not affect $V_{\\max}$. The equation for the rate of the inhibited reaction, $v_i$, is:\n$$\nv_i = \\frac{V_{\\max} [\\mathrm{RetA}]}{K_{m}^{\\text{app}} + [\\mathrm{RetA}]}\n$$\nwhere the apparent Michaelis constant is defined as:\n$$\nK_{m}^{\\text{app}} = K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{Acet}]}{K_i}\\right)\n$$\nHere, $[\\mathrm{Acet}]$ is the inhibitor concentration and $K_i$ is the inhibition constant.

It combines pharmacokinetic modeling (one-compartment with Michaelis-Menten elimination for ethanol) with pharmacodynamic modeling (competitive inhibition, Hill-type response, logistic probability mapping). These are all established formalisms.

The problem does not violate known principles.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It defines a system of coupled first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with specified initial conditions. A unique solution exists and can be obtained via numerical integration. All parameters are defined, and the procedure for calculating the final output is unambiguous.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, quantitative terms, free of subjective or ambiguous language.\n4.  **Complete and Consistent**: All necessary equations, parameters, and conditions for solving the problem are provided. There are no internal contradictions.\n5.  **Not Trivial**: The problem requires the numerical solution of a nonlinear, coupled ODE system and subsequent integration and mapping, which is a non-trivial computational task.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a sound, well-posed problem in computational developmental biology. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of a defect probability, $P$, based on an apoptosis burden, $B$, which is driven by a deficit in retinoic acid, $R$, caused by exposure to ethanol, $E$. This constitutes a coupled dynamical system that must be solved numerically.\n\nFirst, we establish the constant model parameters. The maximal rate of retinoic acid synthesis, $V_{\\max,\\mathrm{RA}}$, is calibrated to ensure a steady-state retinoic acid concentration $R=1$ in the absence of ethanol ($E=0$). At steady state, $\\frac{dR}{dt}=0$, so $v_{\\mathrm{syn}}(0) = k_{\\mathrm{deg}} R_{ss}$. With $E=0$ and $R_{ss}=1$, this gives:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\max,\\mathrm{RA}} \\ S_0}{K_{m,\\mathrm{RA}} + S_0} = k_{\\mathrm{deg}} \\cdot 1\n$$\nSolving for $V_{\\max,\\mathrm{RA}}$:\n$$\nV_{\\max,\\mathrm{RA}} = k_{\\mathrm{deg}} \\frac{K_{m,\\mathrm{RA}} + S_0}{S_0} = 0.2 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1} \\frac{0.5 \\ \\text{a.u.} + 1.0 \\ \\text{a.u.}}{1.0 \\ \\text{a.u.}} = 0.3 \\ \\mathrm{a.u.}/\\mathrm{h}\n$$\n\nThe core of the problem is to solve for the time-evolution of $E(t)$ and $R(t)$ following an ethanol exposure at $t=t_{\\mathrm{exp}}$. This is governed by the system of coupled ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dt} = - \\frac{V_{\\max,\\mathrm{elim}}^{\\mathrm{eff}} \\ E}{K_{m,\\mathrm{elim}} + E}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\frac{V_{\\max,\\mathrm{RA}} \\ S_0}{K_{m,\\mathrm{RA}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{E}{K_{i,\\mathrm{RA}}^{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\right) + S_0} - k_{\\mathrm{deg}} \\ R\n$$\nIn this system, $V_{\\max,\\mathrm{elim}}^{\\mathrm{eff}} = f_{\\mathrm{elim}} V_{\\max,\\mathrm{elim}}$ and $K_{i,\\mathrm{RA}}^{\\mathrm{eff}} = f_{K_i} K_{i,\\mathrm{RA}}$ are the effective parameters for a given test case.\n\nThe apoptosis burden, $B = \\int_{t_s}^{t_e} A(t) \\ dt$, must also be computed. A robust numerical strategy is to introduce a third state variable, $B_{\\mathrm{int}}(t)$, representing the cumulative apoptosis burden, and solve an augmented system:\n$$\n\\frac{dB_{\\mathrm{int}}}{dt} = A(R(t)) = \\begin{cases} A_{\\max} \\left( \\max(0, 1 - R(t)) \\right)^{h} & \\text{if } t_s \\le t \\le t_e \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe state vector for the ODE solver is $y(t) = [E(t), R(t), B_{\\mathrm{int}}(t)]^T$.\n\nThe procedure for a single test case $(D, t_{\\mathrm{exp}}, f_{K_i}, f_{\\mathrm{elim}})$ is as follows:\n1.  Handle the trivial case: If the exposure time $t_{\\mathrm{exp}}$ is at or after the end of the sensitivity window $t_e = 24 \\ \\mathrm{h}$, the ethanol exposure cannot affect the outcome. The burden $B$ is $0$. The probability is then $P = (1 + \\exp(B_{50}/k_B))^{-1}$.\n\n2.  For $t_{\\mathrm{exp}} < t_e$, perform a numerical integration.\n    a. Calculate the initial ethanol concentration at $t=t_{\\mathrm{exp}}$:\n    $$\n    E_0 = \\frac{1000 \\ D}{M_W V_d} = \\frac{1000 \\ D}{(46.07)(0.6)} \\ \\text{mM}\n    $$\n    b. Set the initial conditions for the ODE system at time $t = t_{\\mathrm{exp}}$. Before exposure, the system is at steady state with $R=1$ and the accumulated burden is $0$. Thus, the initial state vector is:\n    $$\n    y(t_{\\mathrm{exp}}) = [E_0, 1.0, 0.0]^T\n    $$\n    c. Define the integration interval as $[t_{\\mathrm{exp}}, t_e]$. The system of three ODEs is integrated over this time span.\n    d. The total apoptosis burden, $B$, is the value of the third state variable, $B_{\\mathrm{int}}(t)$, at the end of the integration, i.e., $B = B_{\\mathrm{int}}(t_e)$. The time-dependent conditional in the definition of $dB_{\\mathrm{int}}/dt$ ensures that apoptosis is only integrated within the window $[t_s, t_e]$, correctly handling cases where $t_{\\mathrm{exp}} < t_s$.\n\n3.  Once the burden $B$ is determined, map it to the defect probability $P$ using the logistic function:\n$$\nP = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{B - B_{50}}{k_B}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{B - 1.5}{0.6}\\right)}\n$$\n\nThis procedure is implemented programmatically and applied to each of the six specified test cases. A standard numerical ODE solver, such as a Runge-Kutta method, is required for the integration step.
