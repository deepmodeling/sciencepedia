Let $x$ denote the activity of an epithelial determinant and $y$ denote the activity of a mesenchymal determinant (for example, an EMT transcription factor (TF)).

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for an analytical solution. We will now proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe dynamical system is given by the following coupled ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+y^{n}} - x\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+x^{n}} - y\n$$\nHere, $x$ and $y$ represent the activities of epithelial and mesenchymal transcriptional programs, respectively. The parameter $\\alpha > 0$ is the effective production rate, and $n > 1$ is the Hill coefficient for the repressive interactions.\n\nFirst, we identify the symmetric steady state of the system, where $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$, $\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0$, and $x=y$. Let us denote this steady-state concentration as $x^*$, such that the steady state is $(x^*, x^*)$. Substituting these conditions into the equations, we obtain a single equation for $x^*$:\n$$\nx^* = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+(x^*)^{n}}\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to express $\\alpha$ as a function of $x^*$:\n$$\n\\alpha = x^*(1 + (x^*)^{n}) = x^* + (x^*)^{n+1}\n$$\nThis equation relates the steady-state value $x^*$ to the system parameter $\\alpha$.\n\nNext, we analyze the local stability of this symmetric steady state. Stability is determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix, $J$, evaluated at the steady state. The generic Jacobian for this system is:\n$$\nJ(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{1+y^{n}} - x\\right) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{1+y^{n}} - x\\right) \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{1+x^{n}} - y\\right) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{1+x^{n}} - y\\right) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -\\frac{\\alpha n y^{n-1}}{(1+y^n)^2} \\\\ -\\frac{\\alpha n x^{n-1}}{(1+x^n)^2} & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe evaluate this matrix at the symmetric steady state $(x^*, x^*)$:\n$$\nJ(x^*,x^*) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -\\frac{\\alpha n (x^*)^{n-1}}{(1+(x^*)^n)^2} \\\\ -\\frac{\\alpha n (x^*)^{n-1}}{(1+(x^*)^n)^2} & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nLet us define the off-diagonal term as $A = \\frac{\\alpha n (x^*)^{n-1}}{(1+(x^*)^n)^2}$. The Jacobian simplifies to:\n$$\nJ^* = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -A \\\\ -A & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(J^* - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1-\\lambda & -A \\\\ -A & -1-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (-1-\\lambda)^2 - (-A)^2 = (1+\\lambda)^2 - A^2 = 0\n$$\nThis gives $(1+\\lambda) = \\pm A$, leading to the two eigenvalues:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = A - 1\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_2 = -A - 1\n$$\nAccording to the stability criterion provided, the steady state is locally stable if and only if the real parts of all eigenvalues are negative. Since $\\alpha > 0$, $n > 1$, and $x^*$ must be positive for a biologically meaningful steady state, the term $A$ is strictly positive. Consequently, the eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = -A-1$ is always negative. The stability of the symmetric state is therefore determined entirely by the sign of $\\lambda_1 = A-1$. The state is stable if $\\lambda_1 < 0$ (i.e., $A < 1$) and unstable if $\\lambda_1 > 0$ (i.e., $A > 1$).\n\nA bifurcation, signaling the loss of stability, occurs precisely when an eigenvalue crosses the imaginary axis. For this system, this happens when $\\lambda_1 = 0$. This defines the critical condition for the onset of bistability:\n$$\nA = 1 \\implies \\frac{\\alpha n (x^*)^{n-1}}{(1+(x^*)^n)^2} = 1\n$$\nThis condition, along with the steady-state equation, defines the bifurcation point. We now have a system of two equations for the critical parameter value $\\alpha_c$ and the corresponding steady-state value $x^*_c$:\n1. From the steady state: $\\alpha_c = x^*_c(1 + (x^*_c)^{n})$\n2. From the bifurcation condition: $\\alpha_c n (x^*_c)^{n-1} = (1+(x^*_c)^n)^2$\n\nWe solve this system to find $\\alpha_c$ as a function of $n$. From the steady-state equation, we have $1+(x^*_c)^n = \\alpha_c/x^*_c$. Substituting this into the bifurcation equation gives:\n$$\n\\alpha_c n (x^*_c)^{n-1} = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_c}{x^*_c}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\alpha_c^2}{(x^*_c)^2}\n$$\nSince $\\alpha_c > 0$ for a non-trivial system, we can divide by $\\alpha_c$:\n$$\nn (x^*_c)^{n-1} = \\frac{\\alpha_c}{(x^*_c)^2} \\implies \\alpha_c = n (x^*_c)^{n+1}\n$$\nNow we have two expressions for $\\alpha_c$:\n$$\nn (x^*_c)^{n+1} = x^*_c + (x^*_c)^{n+1}\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $x^*_c$:\n$$\n(n-1)(x^*_c)^{n+1} = x^*_c\n$$\nSince the trivial state $x^*_c=0$ is not of interest (it is stable but corresponds to extinction), we can divide by $x^*_c$ (assuming $x^*_c \\neq 0$):\n$$\n(n-1)(x^*_c)^n = 1 \\implies (x^*_c)^n = \\frac{1}{n-1}\n$$\nThis requires $n > 1$, which is consistent with the problem statement. From this, we find the steady-state concentration at the bifurcation point:\n$$\nx^*_c = \\left(\\frac{1}{n-1}\\right)^{1/n} = (n-1)^{-1/n}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this value of $x^*_c$ back into the expression $\\alpha_c = n (x^*_c)^{n+1}$ to find the critical value $\\alpha_c(n)$:\n$$\n\\alpha_c(n) = n \\left((n-1)^{-1/n}\\right)^{n+1} = n (n-1)^{-(n+1)/n}\n$$\nThis expression can be written in a more clear form:\n$$\n\\alpha_c(n) = \\frac{n}{(n-1)^{(n+1)/n}} = \\frac{n}{(n-1)^{1+1/n}}\n$$\n\nJustification of Biological Relevance:\nThe critical value $\\alpha_c(n)$ is a threshold that separates two distinct dynamical regimes. For $\\alpha < \\alpha_c(n)$, the system is monostable, with a single stable state where epithelial and mesenchymal markers are co-expressed. This corresponds to a plastic, intermediate phenotype. For $\\alpha > \\alpha_c(n)$, the system becomes bistable. The symmetric state becomes unstable, and two new stable states emerge: a high-$x$, low-$y$ (epithelial) state and a low-$x$, high-$y$ (mesenchymal) state.\nIn the context of carcinoma, cells can undergo EMT, a process pathologically reactivated during metastasis. The parameter $\\alpha$ represents the effective synthesis rate of the regulatory factors. Factors in the tumor microenvironment or oncogenic mutations can increase the production of transcription factors, thereby increasing the effective value of $\\alpha$. When this parameter is driven across the critical threshold $\\alpha_c(n)$, the underlying cellular regulatory network gains the capacity for a stable phenotypic switch. The overexpression of a specific EMT-TF (the mesenchymal determinant $y$) acts as a directional bias or perturbation that pushes the cell from the basin of the epithelial state into the newly available basin of attraction for the mesenchymal state. The double-negative feedback then locks the cell in this aggressive, migratory phenotype. Therefore, crossing the stability boundary $\\alpha_c(n)$ is the fundamental event that enables the stable acquisition of mesenchymal traits by carcinoma cells.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{n}{(n-1)^{1 + \\frac{1}{n}}}}\n$$", "id": "2623008"}, {"introduction": "Having established how individual cells can choose a fate, we now consider how populations of cells create structured tissues under the guidance of spatial cues.

The morphogen concentration $C(x) = C_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of position $x$. The gene activation function $f(C) = \\dfrac{C^n}{K^n + C^n}$ is a monotonically increasing function of concentration $C$. Therefore, the composite function $f(C(x))$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $x$. This implies that a lower activation fraction ($0.1$) corresponds to a larger position $x$ and a higher activation fraction ($0.9$) corresponds to a smaller position $x$. Thus, $x_{0.1} > x_{0.9}$, and the width is correctly defined as $\\Delta x(n) = x_{0.1} - x_{0.9}$.\n\nFirst, we must express the concentration $C$ required to achieve a given activation level $f$.
