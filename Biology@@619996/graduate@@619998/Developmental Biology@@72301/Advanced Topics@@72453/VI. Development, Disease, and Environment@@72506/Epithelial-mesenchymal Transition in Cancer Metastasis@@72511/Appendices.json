As per the problem specification, the numerical values for $K$ and $n$ are rounded to three decimal places and presented in a final concatenated list. The data provided in the problem are exceptionally clean and appear to be generated directly from the model function with integer or simple rational parameters. This ensures that a correctly implemented numerical fitting procedure will converge precisely to the true underlying parameter values.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import curve_fit\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the Hill equation parameters K and n for three datasets\n    using nonlinear least squares fitting.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the Hill-type repression function to be fitted.\n    # The function signature f(x, p1, p2, ...) is required by scipy.optimize.curve_fit,\n    # where x is the independent variable and p_i are the parameters to fit.\n    def hill_repression_model(c, K, n):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the normalized ZEB level based on the Hill repression model.\n        Args:\n            c (np.ndarray): miR-200 mimic concentration (nM).\n            K (float): Effective repression coefficient (nM).\n            n (float): Hill coefficient (dimensionless).\n        Returns:\n            np.ndarray: Normalized ZEB level.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Using np.power is safe for c=0.\n        # To prevent division by zero or warnings if K is ever zero during optimization,\n        # a small epsilon could be added, but the bounds constraint makes this unnecessary.\n        term = np.power(c / K, n)\n        return 1.0 / (1.0 + term)\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case includes concentrations, ZEB levels, and a sensible initial guess [K_0, n_0].\n    # The initial guess for K is based on the concentration where the response is near 0.5.\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"c\": np.array([0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100]),\n            \"y\": np.array([1.0, 0.9900990099009901, 0.9615384615384616, 0.8, 0.5, 0.2, 0.038461538461538464, 0.009900990099009901]),\n            \"p0\": [10.0, 2.0]  # K is approx. 10 since y(10) = 0.5\n        },\n        {\n            \"c\": np.array([0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50]),\n            \"y\": np.array([1.0, 0.8333333333333334, 0.7142857142857143, 0.5, 0.3333333333333333, 0.2, 0.09090909090909091]),\n            \"p0\": [5.0, 1.0]   # K is approx. 5 since y(5) = 0.5\n        },\n        {\n            \"c\": np.array([0, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100]),\n            \"y\": np.array([1.0, 0.9984031986127729, 0.975, 0.5, 0.058823529411764705, 0.012195121951219513, 0.0038910505836575876]),\n            \"p0\": [25.0, 2.0]  # K is approx. 25 since y(25) = 0.5. n_guess=2 is standard.\n        }\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    # Define bounds for the parameters K and n to be positive.\n    # A small positive number is used for the lower bound to strictly enforce K > 0, n > 0.\n    bounds = ([1e-9, 1e-9], [np.inf, np.inf])\n\n    # Process each test case.\n    for case in test_cases:\n        # Perform the nonlinear least squares fit.\n        # popt contains the optimal parameter values.\n        # pcov contains the estimated covariance of popt.\n        popt, pcov = curve_fit(\n            f=hill_repression_model,\n            xdata=case[\"c\"],\n            ydata=case[\"y\"],\n            p0=case[\"p0\"],\n            bounds=bounds\n        )\n        \n        K_fit, n_fit = popt\n        results.append(K_fit)\n        results.append(n_fit)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # The format string '{x:.3f}' ensures each value is rounded to three decimal places.\n    print(f\"[{','.join([f'{x:.3f}' for x in results])}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2635850"}]}
