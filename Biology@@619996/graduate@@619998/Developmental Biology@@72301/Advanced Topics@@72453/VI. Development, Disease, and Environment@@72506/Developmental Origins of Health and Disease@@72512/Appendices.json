It presents a solvable problem using standard models. We will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the steady-state fraction of fetal glucocorticoid receptors (GR) occupied by cortisol. This is a two-part problem. First, we must determine the steady-state concentration of cortisol in the fetal compartment, $[C_f]_{ss}$. Second, we use this concentration to calculate the receptor occupancy based on the law of mass action.\n\nLet us define the variables from the problem statement:\n- Maternal unbound plasma cortisol concentration, $C_{m,u} = 50\\,\\text{nM}$.\n- Fraction of cortisol escaping placental metabolism by 11$\\beta$-HSD2, $f_{escape} = 0.08$.\n- First-order transfer rate constant from placenta to fetus, $k_{in} = 0.02\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$.\n- First-order clearance rate constant from the fetus, $k_{out} = 0.005\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$.\n- Dissociation constant of the fetal GR for cortisol, $K_d = 10\\,\\text{nM}$.\n- Fetal cortisol concentration at time $t$, $C_f(t)$.\n\nThe effective concentration of cortisol at the maternal side of the placental barrier that is available for transport is the unbound maternal concentration multiplied by the fraction that escapes enzymatic conversion:\n$$ C_{transport} = C_{m,u} \\times f_{escape} $$\n\nThe dynamics of the fetal cortisol concentration, $C_f(t)$, are described by a first-order linear ordinary differential equation, based on the assumption of a well-mixed compartment. The rate of change of $C_f(t)$ is the difference between the rate of cortisol input and the rate of its clearance:\n$$ \\frac{dC_f(t)}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of Input}) - (\\text{Rate of Clearance}) $$\n\nThe rate of input is proportional to the effective transport concentration $C_{transport}$ with rate constant $k_{in}$. The rate of clearance is proportional to the current fetal concentration $C_f(t)$ with rate constant $k_{out}$.\n$$ \\frac{dC_f(t)}{dt} = k_{in} (C_{m,u} \\cdot f_{escape}) - k_{out} C_f(t) $$\n\nAt steady-state, the concentration no longer changes with time, so $\\frac{dC_f}{dt} = 0$.

The corresponding p-value threshold is $t_{\\mathrm{BH}} = p_{(2028)} \\approx 0.001014$. The minimum q-value corresponds to the smallest generated p-value (which is near zero), and the maximum q-value corresponds to the largest p-value (which is near one).

This condition can never be met for $k \\le 50$. Therefore, no hypotheses are rejected, and $r=0$.\nThe rejection threshold $t_{\\mathrm{BH}}$ is $0.0$ by definition for cases with no rejections.\nFor the q-values, $q_{(50)} = p_{(50)} = 1.0$. For any $i < 50$, $q_{(i)} = \\min(q_{(i+1)}, p_{(i)} \\cdot 50/i) = \\min(1.0, 1.0 \\cdot 50/i) = 1.0$, since $50/i \\ge 1.0$. Thus, all q-values are $1.0$.\nThis gives $\\min(q)=1.0$ and $\\max(q)=1.0$.
