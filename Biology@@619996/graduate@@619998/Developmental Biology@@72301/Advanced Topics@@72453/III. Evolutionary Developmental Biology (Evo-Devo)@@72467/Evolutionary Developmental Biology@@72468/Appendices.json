It represents the length scale over which the morphogen concentration decays by a factor of $1/e \\approx 0.37$. Morphogen gradients provide positional information to cells, which respond by activating different sets of genes and differentiating into distinct cell types when the concentration crosses specific thresholds. The spatial extent of these developmental fields is therefore determined by the concentration profile $c(x)$. The length scale $\\lambda$ sets the spatial scale of the entire pattern. Evolutionary modifications to the biophysical parameters $D$ and $\\mu$ directly alter $\\lambda$. An increase in the diffusion coefficient $D$ or a decrease in the removal rate $\\mu$ leads to a larger $\\lambda$. This creates a shallower, more spread-out gradient, causing patterning domains to expand and shift away from the source. Conversely, a decrease in $D$ or an increase in $\\mu$ leads to a smaller $\\lambda$, creating a steeper, more localized gradient and compressing the pattern.
