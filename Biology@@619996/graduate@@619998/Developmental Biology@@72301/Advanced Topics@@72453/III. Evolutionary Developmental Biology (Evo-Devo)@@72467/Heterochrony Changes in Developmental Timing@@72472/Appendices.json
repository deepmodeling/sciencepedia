The parameters ($t_{\\mathrm{on}}$, $t_{\\mathrm{off}}$, $k$) are standard in this field. The scenario described is biologically plausible for amphibians. All provided information is self-contained, consistent, and sufficient to formulate a unique solution. The language is precise and objective. There are no violations of scientific principles, logical contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine how the developmental parameters of a somatic trait have changed from the ancestor to the descendant. We analyze each of the three axes of heterochrony based on the given information.\n\n1.  **Rate of Development ($k$)**: The problem explicitly states that the average somatic growth rate is the same in both populations. Thus, we have no change in the rate:\n    $$k_{\\mathrm{desc}} \\approx k_{\\mathrm{anc}}$$\n\n2.  **Onset of Development ($t_{\\mathrm{on}}$)**: The problem explicitly states that the onset times are indistinguishable. Thus, we have no change in the onset time:\n    $$t_{\\mathrm{on,desc}} \\approx t_{\\mathrm{on,anc}}$$\n\n3.  **Offset of Development ($t_{\\mathrm{off}}$)**: The problem links the offset of somatic growth to the age of reproductive maturity in both populations ($t_{\\mathrm{off}} \\approx t_{\\mathrm{m}}$). It is given that the descendant population reaches reproductive maturity earlier than the ancestral one:\n    $$t_{\\mathrm{m,desc}} < t_{\\mathrm{m,anc}}$$\n    From the coupling of offset and maturity, it directly follows that the offset of somatic growth is also earlier in the descendant:\n    $$t_{\\mathrm{off,desc}} < t_{\\mathrm{off,anc}}$$\n\n**Classification of Heterochrony**\n\nWe have established the following changes: no change in rate, no change in onset, and an earlier offset. We must now classify this pattern.\n\nHeterochrony is broadly divided into two major categories based on the comparison of the descendant adult form to the ancestral ontogeny:\n- **Paedomorphosis**: The descendant adult resembles a juvenile stage of the ancestor. This occurs when development is truncated or slowed.\n- **Peramorphosis**: The descendant adult develops beyond the ancestral adult form. This occurs when development is extended or accelerated.\n\nTo determine which category applies, we must evaluate the final somatic trait size, $S$, at the time of offset. Assuming a linear approximation as specified, the size at offset is a function of the initial size $S(t_{\\mathrm{on}})$, the rate $k$, and the duration of growth $(t_{\\mathrm{off}} - t_{\\mathrm{on}})$.\nThe size at offset for the ancestor is:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{anc}}(t_{\\mathrm{off,anc}}) \\approx S(t_{\\mathrm{on,anc}}) + k_{\\mathrm{anc}} \\cdot (t_{\\mathrm{off,anc}} - t_{\\mathrm{on,anc}})$$\nThe size at offset for the descendant is:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{desc}}(t_{\\mathrm{off,desc}}) \\approx S(t_{\\mathrm{on,desc}}) + k_{\\mathrm{desc}} \\cdot (t_{\\mathrm{off,desc}} - t_{\\mathrm{on,desc}})$$\nGiven $k_{\\mathrm{desc}} \\approx k_{\\mathrm{anc}}$, $t_{\\mathrm{on,desc}} \\approx t_{\\mathrm{on,anc}}$, and assuming the initial sizes are comparable, the difference in final size is determined by the duration of growth. Since $t_{\\mathrm{off,desc}} < t_{\\mathrm{off,anc}}$, the duration of growth is shorter for the descendant:\n$$(t_{\\mathrm{off,desc}} - t_{\\mathrm{on,desc}}) < (t_{\\mathrm{off,anc}} - t_{\\mathrm{on,anc}})$$\nThis leads to a smaller final somatic size in the descendant:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{desc}}(t_{\\mathrm{off,desc}}) < S_{\\mathrm{anc}}(t_{\\mathrm{off,anc}})$$\nThe adult descendant is smaller than the adult ancestor, resembling a juvenile (sub-adult) stage of the ancestor in terms of size. This is, by definition, **paedomorphosis**.\n\nNext, we must identify the specific mechanism of paedomorphosis.\n- **Progenesis**: Paedomorphosis via early cessation of somatic development, caused by precocious sexual maturation. The characteristic change is an earlier offset ($t_{\\mathrm{off,desc}} < t_{\\mathrm{off,anc}}$) with no change in rate or onset.\n- **Neoteny**: Paedomorphosis via a reduction in the rate of somatic development ($k_{\\mathrm{desc}} < k_{\\mathrm{anc}}$) over a similar developmental period.\n- **Postdisplacement**: Paedomorphosis via a delayed onset of somatic development ($t_{\\mathrm{on,desc}} > t_{\\mathrm{on,anc}}$).\n\nOur derived changes—no change in $t_{\\mathrm{on}}$, no change in $k$, and an earlier $t_{\\mathrm{off}}$—perfectly match the definition of **progenesis**.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n- **A. Paedomorphosis by progenesis: earlier offset due to earlier reproductive maturity, with $t_{\\mathrm{off,desc}} < t_{\\mathrm{off,anc}}$, $k_{\\mathrm{desc}} = k_{\\mathrm{anc}}$, and $t_{\\mathrm{on,desc}} \\approx t_{\\mathrm{on,anc}}$; predicts a reduced $S_{\\mathrm{desc}}(t_{\\mathrm{off,desc}})$ relative to $S_{\\mathrm{anc}}(t_{\\mathrm{off,anc}})$ and retention of juvenile somatic features at reproduction.**\nThis option correctly identifies the outcome as paedomorphosis and the mechanism as progenesis. It correctly lists the parameter changes: earlier offset ($t_{\\mathrm{off,desc}} < t_{\\mathrm{off,anc}}$), same rate ($k_{\\mathrm{desc}} = k_{\\mathrm{anc}}$), and same onset ($t_{\\mathrm{on,desc}} \\approx t_{\\mathrm{on,anc}}$), all consistent with our derivation. It also correctly predicts the morphological result of a smaller adult size. This description is entirely correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n- **B. Paedomorphosis by neoteny: slower somatic rate, with $k_{\\mathrm{desc}} < k_{\\mathrm{anc}}$ and $t_{\\mathrm{off,desc}} \\approx t_{\\mathrm{off,anc}}$, $t_{\\mathrm{on,desc}} \\approx t_{\\mathrm{on,anc}}$; predicts reduced $S$ at the same reproductive age due to rate depression.**\nThis option proposes neoteny, which requires a slower rate of development ($k_{\\mathrm{desc}} < k_{\\mathrm{anc}}$). This contradicts the problem statement that $k_{\\mathrm{desc}} \\approx k_{\\mathrm{anc}}$. It also incorrectly assumes $t_{\\mathrm{off,desc}} \\approx t_{\\mathrm{off,anc}}$, which contradicts the given condition of earlier maturation.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **C. Peramorphosis by hypermorphosis: later offset due to delayed reproductive maturity, with $t_{\\mathrm{off,desc}} > t_{\\mathrm{off,anc}}$, $k_{\\mathrm{desc}} = k_{\\mathrm{anc}}$, $t_{\\mathrm{on,desc}} \\approx t_{\\mathrm{on,anc}}$; predicts larger $S$ at reproduction.**\nThis option proposes peramorphosis, which is the opposite of the observed paedomorphic outcome. It also posits a later offset ($t_{\\mathrm{off,desc}} > t_{\\mathrm{off,anc}}$), in direct contradiction to the condition $t_{\\mathrm{m,desc}} < t_{\\mathrm{m,anc}}$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D. Peramorphosis by predisplacement: earlier onset of somatic development, with $t_{\\mathrm{on,desc}} < t_{\\mathrm{on,anc}}$, $k_{\\mathrm{desc}} = k_{\\mathrm{anc}}$, $t_{\\mathrm{off,desc}} \\approx t_{\\mathrm{off,anc}}$; predicts larger $S$ at the same reproductive age due to extended developmental duration before reproduction.**\nThis option proposes peramorphosis, again contradicting the paedomorphic result. The mechanism of predisplacement requires an earlier onset ($t_{\\mathrm{on,desc}} < t_{\\mathrm{on,anc}}$), which contradicts the given information that $t_{\\mathrm{on,desc}} \\approx t_{\\mathrm{on,anc}}$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nThe only option that is fully consistent with the problem statement and the principles of heterochrony is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2641852"}, {"introduction": "While many studies of heterochrony focus on continuous traits like size, development can also be viewed as a sequence of discrete events.

The only non-zero difference encoding is $d(1,2) = 1$, which signifies that the relative order of events $E_1$ and $E_2$ is reversed between the two species. All other pairs maintain their relative order.\n\nThe second task is to determine the minimum number of \"event flips\" required to transform the order in species $A$ to that of species $B$. An event flip is defined as the swapping of two adjacent events in the sequence. This is a standard problem in combinatorics, where the minimum number of adjacent swaps required to transform one permutation into another is sought.\n\nThis minimum number is precisely the number of inversions in one permutation relative to the other. An inversion is a pair of elements that appear in opposite order in the two permutations. The event-pair difference encoding $d(i,j)$ is constructed to be exactly an indicator for such inversions: $d(i,j)=1$ if the order of the pair $\\{E_i, E_j\\}$ is reversed, and $d(i,j)=0$ otherwise.\n\nTherefore, the total number of inversions is the sum of all $d(i,j)$ over all distinct pairs $\\{i,j\\}$.\n$$ \\text{Number of inversions} = \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le 4} d(i,j) $$\nUsing the results from the first task:\n$$ \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le 4} d(i,j) = d(1,2) + d(1,3) + d(1,4) + d(2,3) + d(2,4) + d(3,4) $$\n$$ = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1 $$\nThe minimum number of adjacent swaps required is therefore $1$.\n\nWe can verify this directly. The sequence for species $A$ is $(E_1, E_2, E_3, E_4)$. The target sequence for species $B$ is $(E_2, E_1, E_3, E_4)$. By swapping the first two adjacent events, $E_1$ and $E_2$, we have:\n$$ (E_1, E_2, E_3, E_4) \\xrightarrow{\\text{swap}(E_1, E_2)} (E_2, E_1, E_3, E_4) $$\nThis single operation transforms the sequence of species $A$ into that of species $B$.

We must evaluate the trait size of the manipulated organism at its new final age $T'$.\n$$\nX_{\\mathrm{after}}(T') = \\int_{0}^{T'} r_{\\mathrm{after}}(t) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{T+\\epsilon} r_{\\mathrm{after}}(t) \\, dt\n$$\nWe can split this integral at time $T$ for analytical convenience:\n$$\nX_{\\mathrm{after}}(T+\\epsilon) = \\int_{0}^{T} r_{\\mathrm{after}}(t) \\, dt + \\int_{T}^{T+\\epsilon} r_{\\mathrm{after}}(t) \\, dt\n$$\nFrom the previous analysis, we know that the first term is $\\int_{0}^{T} r_{\\mathrm{after}}(t) \\, dt = X_{\\mathrm{before}}(T)$.\n\nFor the second term, we must find the rate $r_{\\mathrm{after}}(t)$ in the interval $[T, T+\\epsilon)$. This interval of time falls within the manipulated final phase, which extends from $T_{n-1}$ to $T+\\epsilon$. Therefore, the rate within this interval is the constant rate of the final phase, $r_n$.\nThe integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{T}^{T+\\epsilon} r_n \\, dt = r_n \\cdot [t]_{T}^{T+\\epsilon} = r_n \\cdot ((T+\\epsilon) - T) = r_n \\epsilon\n$$\nSubstituting these results back, we find the final size at the new offset time:\n$$\nX_{\\mathrm{after}}(T') = X_{\\mathrm{before}}(T) + r_n \\epsilon\n$$\nThe change in trait size under the offset-delayed condition is:\n$$\n\\Delta X_{\\mathrm{offset}} = X_{\\mathrm{after}}(T') - X_{\\mathrm{before}}(T) = (X_{\\mathrm{before}}(T) + r_n \\epsilon) - X_{\\mathrm{before}}(T) = r_n \\epsilon\n$$\n\n3.  **Classification of the manipulation**\n\nThe problem provides two definitions:\n- **Acceleration:** a change in rate $r_i$ with unchanged timing.\n- **Hypermorphosis:** a delay of developmental offset (increasing terminal time $T$) with unchanged rates $r_i$.\n\nIn the specified manipulation, the rates $r_i$ were explicitly held constant. The developmental offset time was extended from $T$ to $T' = T+\\epsilon$. This corresponds exactly to the definition of hypermorphosis. Therefore, this manipulation is hypermorphosis, and the classification variable $c$ must be $1$.\n\nCombining these three results into the required row matrix gives $[\\Delta X_{\\mathrm{fixed}}, \\Delta X_{\\mathrm{offset}}, c] = [0, r_n \\epsilon, 1]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & r_n \\epsilon & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2641827"}]}
