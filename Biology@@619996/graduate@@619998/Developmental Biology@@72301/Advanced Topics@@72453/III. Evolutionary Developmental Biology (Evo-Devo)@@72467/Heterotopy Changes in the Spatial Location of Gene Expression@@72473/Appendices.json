It provides a formalizable model of morphogen gradient-based patterning, which is a fundamental concept in developmental biology. All necessary parameters and conditions are specified, and the problem is free of internal contradictions or ambiguities. We may proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem specifies a one-dimensional steady-state morphogen concentration gradient along the coordinate $x \\ge 0$ given by the function:\n$$C(x) = C_{0}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nHere, $C_{0}$ is the concentration at the source ($x=0$) and $\\lambda$ is the characteristic decay length. The parameters are constrained such that $C_{0} > 0$ and $\\lambda > 0$.\n\nA target gene's expression domain is defined by the region where the local morphogen concentration $C(x)$ is greater than or equal to a constant activation threshold $T$, where $0 < T < C_{0}$. The boundary of this expression domain, denoted $x^{*}$, is the specific position where the concentration is exactly equal to the threshold. This is defined by the equation:\n$$C(x^{*}) = T$$\n\nOur first objective is to derive an explicit expression for this boundary position, $x^{*}$. We substitute the given form of $C(x)$ into the defining equation:\n$$C_{0}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{*}}{\\lambda}\\right) = T$$\nTo solve for $x^{*}$, we must first isolate the exponential term.

The decay length $\\lambda$ is doubled, while the source concentration $C_{0}$ and the threshold $T$ remain invariant. The new decay length, $\\lambda_{\\text{new}}$, is therefore:\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{new}} = 2\\lambda$$\nThe new boundary position, $x^{*}_{\\text{new}}$, is found by substituting $\\lambda_{\\text{new}}$ into our derived expression for the boundary position:\n$$x^{*}_{\\text{new}} = \\lambda_{\\text{new}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{T}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\lambda_{\\text{new}}$:\n$$x^{*}_{\\text{new}} = 2\\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{T}\\right)$$\nThe problem requires the computation of the spatial shift, $\\Delta x$, defined as the difference between the new and old boundary positions:\n$$\\Delta x = x^{*}_{\\text{new}} - x^{*}_{\\text{old}}$$\nWe substitute the expressions for $x^{*}_{\\text{new}}$ and $x^{*}_{\\text{old}}$:\n$$\\Delta x = \\left(2\\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{T}\\right)\\right) - \\left(\\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{T}\\right)\\right)$$\nFactoring out the common term $\\lambda \\ln(C_{0}/T)$ gives:\n$$\\Delta x = (2 - 1) \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{T}\\right)$$\nThe calculation simplifies directly to:\n$$\\Delta x = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{T}\\right)$$\nThis is the final expression for the spatial shift of the expression domain boundary, expressed in terms of the initial parameters $C_{0}$, $T$, and $\\lambda$.

In species $\\mathrm{S}_1$, gene $G$ is expressed ventrally in the first pharyngeal arch, whereas in species $\\mathrm{S}_2$, $G$ is expressed dorsally. A noncoding element $E^\\ast$ located $\\leq$ $10$ kilobases upstream of the $G$ transcription start site is implicated by population genetics in the divergence between the species. The investigator wishes to make two separate causal claims about $E^\\ast$ with respect to the heterotopic pattern: (i) $E^\\ast$ is sufficient to drive ventral expression, and (ii) $E^\\ast$ is necessary for $G$’s ventral expression in its endogenous genomic context. The investigator must avoid circular reasoning that would arise from using readouts or constructs that already encode the pattern under test.\n\nUse the following fundamental base: the Central Dogma (DNA to RNA to protein), the definition of an enhancer as a cis-regulatory DNA element that increases transcription of a target promoter in a position- and orientation-independent manner by recruiting transcription factors, and the definitions that an element $X$ is sufficient for a spatial pattern $S$ if $X$ can drive $S$ when placed with a neutral minimal promoter at a genomic location that does not otherwise produce $S$, and $X$ is necessary for $S$ at a locus if deletion of $X$ specifically abolishes $S$ for the native gene in its endogenous genomic context, ruling out indirect effects. Assume safe-harbor loci can be used to minimize position effects, and that orientation independence and integration-site controls are standard good practice.\n\nThe investigator considers the following experiments and observations (all sample sizes use $n$ individuals unless otherwise noted):\n\n(1) Safe-harbor transgenic reporter: Clone $E^\\ast$ from $\\mathrm{S}_1$ upstream of a neutral minimal promoter $P_{\\min}$ driving a fluorescent reporter $R$, integrate as a single copy at a safe-harbor site $H$ in a model fish, and assay expression in the first arch. Compare the centroid $\\vec{r}_{R}$ of reporter intensity $I_{R}(x,y)$ to the centroid $\\vec{r}_{V}$ of an independent ventral marker $M_{V}$. Across $k \\geq 3$ independent integration lines and $n \\geq 20$ embryos per line, the displacement satisfies $\\|\\vec{r}_{R} - \\vec{r}_{V}\\| \\leq \\epsilon$ with $p < 0.001$ relative to a $P_{\\min}$-only control, indicating ventral-specific activity. Orientation-reversed $E^\\ast$ yields indistinguishable patterns, and a scrambled $E^\\ast$ of equal length yields no expression above background.\n\n(2) Endogenous deletion: In $\\mathrm{S}_1$, delete $E^\\ast$ by CRISPR–Cas9 to create a precise deletion of $$200 base pairs, confirmed by whole-genome sequencing to have no off-target edits above $1$ single-nucleotide variant per $10^8$ bases and by circularized chromosome conformation capture (4C) to leave topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries unchanged. Single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) detects loss of ventral $G$ transcripts with no change dorsally at stage $t_0$, quantified as a drop in ventral $G$ puncta from mean $\\mu_0$ to $\\approx 0$ with effect size $d > 2$ and $p  0.001$. Craniofacial morphology shows ventral cartilage defects consistent with loss of $G$.\n\n(3) Endogenous rescue: Reinsert the exact $E^\\ast$ sequence at the endogenous locus in the $\\Delta E^\\ast$ background, restoring the wild-type haplotype with no additional changes. Ventral $G$ smFISH puncta return to $\\mu_0 \\pm \\delta$ and ventral cartilage is rescued, with $p  0.01$ relative to the deletion and no difference from wild type at $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\n(4) Ortholog swap: Replace $E^\\ast$ in $\\mathrm{S}_1$ with the $\\mathrm{S}_2$ ortholog $E^{(2)}$, leaving all other sequence unchanged.

The reporter recapitulates ventral expression but integration-site effects vary, and a $G$-promoter-only reporter already drives weak ventral expression.\n\n(6) Chromatin contact assay (Hi-C and 4C): In wild type, $E^\\ast$ contacts the $G$ promoter with contact frequency $f_{WT}$; in $\\Delta E^\\ast$, the contact disappears.

Use experiments $(1)$ and $(2)$, omitting integration-site controls in $(1)$ and rescue in $(3)$; argue that observing consistent ventral bias in at least one line plus loss-of-function upon deletion is sufficient to conclude both sufficiency and necessity.\n\nE.

This construct is inserted at a safe-harbor site $H$. The resulting ventral reporter expression (centroid $\\vec{r}_{R}$) matches that of a ventral marker $M_V$ (centroid $\\vec{r}_{V}$), with $\\|\\vec{r}_{R} - \\vec{r}_{V}\\| \\leq \\epsilon$ ($p  0.001$) across $k \\geq 3$ lines.

The deletion is specific, with no significant off-targets or changes to topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries. This results in the loss of ventral $G$ transcripts.\n    - **(3) Endogenous Rescue**: The exact $E^\\ast$ sequence is reinserted at the endogenous locus of the deletion mutant ($\\Delta E^\\ast$), which restores wild-type ventral $G$ expression and morphology.\n    - **(4) Ortholog Swap**: The $\\mathrm{S}_1$ element $E^\\ast$ is replaced with its ortholog $E^{(2)}$ from $\\mathrm{S}_2$. This causes a loss of ventral $G$ expression and a gain of dorsal $G$ expression.\n    - **(5) Native Promoter Reporter**: $E^\\ast$ is placed upstream of the native $G$ promoter driving a reporter $R$. This recapitulates ventral expression, but is confounded by integration-site effects and weak ventral activity from the $G$ promoter alone.\n    - **(6) Chromatin Contact Assay**: In wild-type $\\mathrm{S}_1$, the $E^\\ast$ element physically contacts the $G$ promoter. This contact is lost in the $\\Delta E^\\ast$ mutant.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, describing standard and advanced methodologies in molecular and developmental biology (transgenesis, CRISPR-based genome editing, chromosome conformation capture, etc.). The concepts of enhancer function, sufficiency, and necessity are central to gene regulation studies. The problem is well-posed, providing explicit and standard definitions for the core claims to be tested. The language is objective and precise. The problem statement is internally consistent, complete, and poses a non-trivial question about experimental design and logical inference. It does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the validation criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe objective is to identify an experimental package that rigorously demonstrates both the sufficiency and necessity of the element $E^\\ast$ for ventral gene expression, according to the provided definitions.\n\n**Sufficiency Test**: The definition requires showing that $E^\\ast$ can drive ventral expression when removed from its native context and paired with neutral components.\n- Experiment **(1)** is the canonical test for enhancer sufficiency. It pairs $E^\\ast$ with a neutral minimal promoter ($P_{\\min}$) and integrates it into a neutral genomic environment (a safe-harbor locus, $H$). The use of multiple independent integration lines, orientation-reversal, and scrambled sequence controls ensures that the observed ventral-specific activity is a robust property of the $E^\\ast$ sequence itself and not an artifact of its position or orientation, nor a generic property of any DNA fragment. This experiment correctly isolates the function of $E^\\ast$.\n- Experiment **(5)** is an invalid test for sufficiency. The use of the native $G$ promoter, which itself possesses weak ventral activity, introduces a confound. It becomes impossible to disentangle the contribution of $E^\\ast$ from the intrinsic activity of the promoter. This constitutes the circular reasoning that the problem statement explicitly warns against.\n\n**Necessity Test**: The definition requires showing that removing $E^\\ast$ from its endogenous locus abolishes the ventral expression of the native gene $G$.\n- Experiment **(2)** is the canonical test for necessity. The precise deletion of $E^\\ast$ from its native locus in species $\\mathrm{S}_1$ and the subsequent observation of specific loss of ventral $G$ expression directly demonstrate that $E^\\ast$ is required for this pattern in its normal context. The extensive controls (no off-targets, stable TADs) rule out indirect effects from unintended mutations or large-scale chromatin disruption.\n- Experiment **(3)**, the endogenous rescue, is a critical component of the necessity argument. By re-introducing $E^\\ast$ and observing the restoration of ventral expression, it proves that the phenotype observed in experiment **(2)** was caused specifically by the absence of the $E^\\ast$ sequence, and not by some unforeseen artifact of the genetic manipulation process. Together, experiments **(2)** and **(3)** form the gold standard for demonstrating necessity.\n\n**Ancillary Experiments**:\n- Experiment **(4)**, the ortholog swap, is a powerful demonstration of the role of $E^\\ast$ in evolutionary divergence but does not formally test the sufficiency or necessity of $E^\\ast$ for ventral expression in $\\mathrm{S}_1$. It shows that sequence changes within this element are responsible for the different spatial specificity between species, but it does not show that $E^\\ast$ is sufficient on its own or necessary in the first place.\n- Experiment **(6)** provides mechanistic evidence. Chromatin contact is a necessary condition for a classical enhancer to act on a promoter, but demonstrating contact does not prove functional sufficiency or necessity. It shows correlation, not causation.\n\nNow, we evaluate the options based on this analysis.\n\n**A. Use experiments (1), (2), and (3) as described...**\n- This package combines the correct sufficiency test (experiment (1)) with the complete, correctly controlled necessity test (experiment (2) for deletion and experiment (3) for rescue).\n- It explicitly notes the avoidance of the native $G$ promoter in reporter assays for the sufficiency claim, thereby avoiding circular reasoning.\n- This set of experiments logically and rigorously substantiates both claims according to the provided strict definitions.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Use experiments (1) and (6) only...**\n- This package provides a valid sufficiency test (experiment (1)).\n- It fails to provide a necessity test. Experiment **(6)** (chromatin contact) is mechanistic and correlational, not a functional test of necessity. One cannot conclude that an element is necessary simply because it is sufficient and touches its target.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Use experiments (2) and (3), but measure rescue by a G-promoter-driven reporter in trans; omit safe-harbor reporter tests...**\n- This package explicitly omits the sufficiency test (experiment (1)), so it cannot justify the sufficiency claim.\n- The description of the rescue experiment is convoluted and non-standard. The proper rescue is an endogenous one, as described in the original problem text for experiment **(3)**.\n- By relying solely on endogenous promoter readouts, no clean sufficiency claim can be made.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Use experiments (1) and (2), omitting integration-site controls in (1) and rescue in (3)...**\n- This package proposes to weaken the experimental evidence by omitting essential controls.\n- Omitting integration-site controls in the sufficiency test **(1)** means a positive result could be a position-effect artifact, not an intrinsic property of $E^\\ast$. The conclusion of sufficiency would be weak.\n- Omitting the rescue experiment **(3)** for the necessity test **(2)** leaves open the possibility that the loss-of-function phenotype is an artifact of the CRISPR manipulation, rather than being caused specifically by the deletion of $E^\\ast$. The conclusion of necessity would be less certain.\n- Good science requires rigor; this option proposes to abandon it.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Use only experiment (4)...**\n- This package uses only the ortholog swap experiment.\n- As analyzed above, while this experiment is highly informative about the evolution of the expression pattern, it does not formally test for sufficiency (as defined by isolation with a neutral promoter) or necessity (as defined by deletion). It is a comparative functional test, not a direct test of the properties of $E^\\ast$ within the $\\mathrm{S}_1}$ context alone.\n- Both the sufficiency and necessity claims remained unproven.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nConclusion: Option A is the only one that presents a logically coherent and experimentally rigorous package to prove both sufficiency and necessity according to the strict definitions given in the problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2642170"}]}
