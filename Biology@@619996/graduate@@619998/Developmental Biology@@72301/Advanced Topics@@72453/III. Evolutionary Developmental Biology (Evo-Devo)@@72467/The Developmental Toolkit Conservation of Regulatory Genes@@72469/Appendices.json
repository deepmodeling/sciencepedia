Consider a homeobox transcription factor with a canonical homeodomain of length $60$ amino acids embedded in a protein of total length $300$ amino acids, so that $240$ amino acids lie outside the homeodomain. You compare orthologous coding sequences from two species whose synonymous divergence is $d_S=0.5$ substitutions per synonymous site. Define the ratio $d_N/d_S=\\omega$ as the ratio of nonsynonymous divergence per nonsynonymous site to synonymous divergence per synonymous site.

The parameters provided ($d_S=0.5$, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{hd}}=0.08$, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{non}}=0.6$) are well within realistic ranges for comparative genomics. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing all necessary information and definitions for a unique solution. It is not trivial, as it requires the correct application of a probability model to concepts from evolutionary biology. The problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the assumption that substitutions at any given site follow a Poisson process. The probability mass function for a Poisson distribution gives the probability of observing exactly $k$ events in a fixed interval of time or space, given that these events occur with a known constant mean rate $\\lambda$. The formula is:\n$$ P(X=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!} $$\nIn this context, an \"event\" is a nonsynonymous substitution at a single amino acid site, and the \"mean rate\" $\\lambda$ is the expected number of such substitutions per site over the evolutionary period in question. This rate is precisely what is defined as $d_N$, the nonsynonymous divergence.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that a homeodomain amino acid is conserved. According to the provided definition, an amino acid is conserved if no nonsynonymous substitution occurs at its site. This corresponds to the case where the number of substitutions, $k$, is zero.\n\nWe are interested in a site within the homeodomain. Therefore, we must use the parameters specific to this domain. The mean rate of nonsynonymous substitutions for a homeodomain site is $\\lambda = d_{N, \\mathrm{hd}}$.\nThe probability of conservation, $P_{\\mathrm{cons, hd}}$, is the probability of observing $k=0$ substitutions:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{cons, hd}} = P(k=0) = \\frac{(d_{N, \\mathrm{hd}})^0 \\exp(-d_{N, \\mathrm{hd}})}{0!} $$\nRecalling that any non-zero number to the power of $0$ is $1$, and $0! = 1$, this simplifies to:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{cons, hd}} = \\exp(-d_{N, \\mathrm{hd}}) $$\nThe problem gives the relationship $d_N = \\omega d_S$. We apply this to the homeodomain:\n$$ d_{N, \\mathrm{hd}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{hd}} d_S $$\nThe given values are $\\omega_{\\mathrm{hd}} = 0.08$ and $d_S = 0.5$. We can now compute the rate parameter $d_{N, \\mathrm{hd}}$:\n$$ d_{N, \\mathrm{hd}} = (0.08) \\times (0.5) = 0.04 $$\nThis value, $d_{N, \\mathrm{hd}}=0.04$, is the expected number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site within the homeodomain for the given evolutionary divergence.\n\nNow, we calculate the probability of conservation using this rate:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{cons, hd}} = \\exp(-0.04) $$\nPerforming the numerical calculation:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{cons, hd}} \\approx 0.960789439... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{cons, hd}} \\approx 0.9608 $$\n\nInterpretation: The parameter $\\omega = d_N/d_S$ is a measure of the selective pressure on a protein. A value of $\\omega  1$ indicates purifying selection, meaning that nonsynonymous mutations are deleterious and are weeded out from the population. The value for the homeodomain, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{hd}} = 0.08$, is very low, signifying intense purifying selection. This is characteristic of a functionally critical domain where the amino acid sequence is highly constrained to preserve its precise function—in this case, sequence-specific DNA binding. In contrast, the non-homeodomain region has $\\omega_{\\mathrm{non}} = 0.6$, which, while still under purifying selection, is nearly an order of magnitude more permissive of amino acid changes. This strong partitioning of selective pressures ($\\omega_{\\mathrm{hd}} \\ll \\omega_{\\mathrm{non}}$) is a classic molecular signature of a developmental \"toolkit\" gene. The functional module (the homeodomain) is rigidly conserved, while other parts of the protein have more evolutionary freedom. The high calculated probability of conservation ($>96\\%$) for a homeodomain site is the direct quantitative consequence of this intense functional constraint, which is the mechanism behind the observed conservation of developmental toolkit components.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.9608}\n$$", "id": "2680399"}, {"introduction": "The conservation of a transcription factor's (TF) DNA-binding domain implies a conserved binding preference, but how does the TF locate its specific targets within the vast sequence space of a genome?

A spurious hit is defined as a word generated from the background genomic model that nonetheless achieves a log-likelihood ratio score of at least a given threshold. The problem further asks for a biological justification of the significance of this number.\n\nFirst, we must determine the score values for individual nucleotides. The log-likelihood ratio score for a base $b$ at position $i$ is given by $S_{i,b} = \\log_{2}(p_{i,b}/q_b)$. The background probabilities are uniform, $q_A=q_C=q_G=q_T=0.25$. The PWM probabilities depend only on whether a base is the consensus base for that position. Let $W = \\text{ACGTACGT}$ be the consensus word.\n\nAt any position $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, 8\\}$, if the base $s_i$ is the consensus base ($s_i = W_i$), its probability is $p_{i,s_i} = 0.7$. The score for a consensus match, which we denote as $S_C$, is:\n$$S_C = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{0.7}{0.25}\\right) = \\log_{2}(2.8)$$\nIf the base $s_i$ is a non-consensus base, its probability is $p_{i,s_i} = 0.1$. The score for a non-consensus base, $S_N$, is:\n$$S_N = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{0.1}{0.25}\\right) = \\log_{2}(0.4)$$\n\nThe total score $S(s)$ for a sequence $s$ of length $m = 8$ is the sum of the individual position scores. Since the scores $S_C$ and $S_N$ are constant for all positions, the total score depends only on the number of positions, $k$, that match the consensus word $W$. The remaining $8-k$ positions will be non-consensus. The total score for a word with $k$ consensus matches is:\n$$S(k) = k \\cdot S_C + (8-k) \\cdot S_N = k \\cdot \\log_{2}(2.8) + (8-k) \\cdot \\log_{2}(0.4)$$\nA word is considered a \"hit\" if its score $S(s)$ is greater than or equal to the threshold $T=4$ bits. We need to find the minimum integer value of $k$ that satisfies this condition.\n$$k \\cdot \\log_{2}(2.8) + (8-k) \\cdot \\log_{2}(0.4) \\geq 4$$\nRearranging the inequality to solve for $k$:\n$$k \\cdot (\\log_{2}(2.8) - \\log_{2}(0.4)) \\geq 4 - 8 \\cdot \\log_{2}(0.4)$$\n$$k \\cdot \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{2.8}{0.4}\\right) \\geq 4 - 8 \\cdot \\log_{2}(0.4)$$\n$$k \\cdot \\log_{2}(7) \\geq 4 - 8 \\cdot \\log_{2}(0.4)$$\n$$k \\geq \\frac{4 - 8 \\cdot \\log_{2}(0.4)}{\\log_{2}(7)}$$\nSubstituting the approximate values $\\log_{2}(7) \\approx 2.80735$ and $\\log_{2}(0.4) \\approx -1.32193$:\n$$k \\geq \\frac{4 - 8(-1.32193)}{2.80735} \\approx \\frac{4 + 10.57544}{2.80735} \\approx \\frac{14.57544}{2.80735} \\approx 5.192$$\nSince $k$ must be an integer, the minimum number of consensus matches required for a hit is $k_{\\text{min}} = 6$. Thus, a word is a hit if it has $k=6$, $k=7$, or $k=8$ matches to the consensus word $W$.\n\nNext, we calculate the probability, $P(\\text{hit})$, that a randomly generated $8$-mer from the background model is a hit. In the i.i.d. background model, each nucleotide has a probability of $0.25$. Therefore, the probability of a randomly chosen nucleotide at a given position matching the consensus base for that position is $p_{match} = 0.25$. The number of matches $k$ in an $8$-mer follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n=8$ and $p=0.25$.\n$$P(k) = \\binom{8}{k} (0.25)^k (1-0.25)^{8-k} = \\binom{8}{k} (0.25)^k (0.75)^{8-k}$$\nThe probability of a hit is the sum of probabilities for $k=6$, $k=7$, and $k=8$:\n$$P(\\text{hit}) = P(k=6) + P(k=7) + P(k=8)$$\n$$P(k=6) = \\binom{8}{6} (0.25)^6 (0.75)^2 = 28 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^6 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = 28 \\cdot \\frac{9}{4^8} = \\frac{252}{65536}$$\n$$P(k=7) = \\binom{8}{7} (0.25)^7 (0.75)^1 = 8 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^7 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^1 = 8 \\cdot \\frac{3}{4^8} = \\frac{24}{65536}$$\n$$P(k=8) = \\binom{8}{8} (0.25)^8 (0.75)^0 = 1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^8 = \\frac{1}{65536}$$\nSumming these probabilities:\n$$P(\\text{hit}) = \\frac{252 + 24 + 1}{65536} = \\frac{277}{65536}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the expected number of spurious hits. The scan is performed on a contiguous genome of length $L=1,000,000$ bp, on both strands, with a one-nucleotide step. The number of $8$-mer windows on a single strand is $N_{\\text{windows.strand}} = L - m + 1 = 1,000,000 - 8 + 1 = 999,993$. Since both strands are scanned, the total number of windows is $N_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\cdot N_{\\text{windows.strand}} = 2 \\cdot 999,993 = 1,999,986$.\n\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected number of hits, $E[\\text{hits}]$, is the total number of windows multiplied by the probability of a single window being a hit.\n$$E[\\text{hits}] = N_{\\text{total}} \\cdot P(\\text{hit}) = 1,999,986 \\cdot \\frac{277}{65536}$$\n$$E[\\text{hits}] = \\frac{553,996,122}{65536} \\approx 8453.2849$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$E[\\text{hits}] \\approx 8453$$\n\nFinally, we address the biological significance. The high expected number of spurious hits (approximately $8453$ in a mere one-megabase region) highlights a fundamental \"signal-to-noise\" problem in developmental gene regulation. The genome is saturated with low-affinity sequences that match a transcription factor's (TF) binding profile by chance. For robust and precise regulation by a conserved TF like Pax6, functional binding sites within enhancers must be distinguishable from this vast background of spurious sites. This selective pressure drives the evolution of several mechanisms to enhance binding specificity and regulatory reliability. These include: (1) True binding sites evolving to have much higher affinity (and thus higher scores) than the minimal threshold for a \"hit\"; (2) The clustering of multiple TF binding sites within a cis-regulatory module (enhancer), where cooperative binding greatly increases the overall avidity and specificity for the target region, effectively filtering out isolated, low-affinity spurious sites; and (3) The positioning of functional sites within regions of accessible chromatin, which prevents TF binding to spurious sites that may be buried in repressive heterochromatin. The large number of potential, low-affinity sites also provides evolutionary raw material, as a few mutations can create or destroy binding sites, facilitating the rapid evolution of enhancer architecture and function under the constraint of a conserved TF toolkit.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8453}$$", "id": "2680490"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the evolutionary pressures on toolkit proteins and the challenge of genomic target recognition, we now examine the functional output of these interactions.
