Assume the following widely accepted foundational bases:\n- In a parsimony framework, the optimal reconstruction minimizes the total number of elementary changes across the tree.\n- An elementary change is a single fission or a single fusion event, each of which changes $s$ by $\\pm 1$.

The problem is a well-defined application of phylogenetic parsimony, a standard method in computational biology. The biological context concerns Hox gene evolution, a cornerstone of developmental biology, and the character states and leaf state assignments are consistent with established paleogenomic and comparative genomic data for the specified taxa (Cephalochordata, Echinodermata, Arthropoda, Nematoda, Annelida). The provided phylogenetic tree represents a widely accepted, albeit simplified, view of bilaterian relationships. The cost function for ordered states is a standard model in phylogenetics (linear or Wagner parsimony). The problem is self-contained, scientifically grounded, objective, and well-posed. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds by determining the state assignments for the internal nodes of the tree that minimize the total number of evolutionary events. The tree topology is $((A,B),((C,D),E))$. Let us define the internal nodes: $N_3$ is the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of $A$ and $B$; $N_2$ is the MRCA of $C$ and $D$; $N_1$ is the MRCA of $(C,D)$ and $E$; and the root, $R$, is the MRCA of $(A,B)$ and $((C,D),E)$. The state of any node $X$ is denoted by $S(X)$.\n\nThe given states are:\n$S(A)=1$, $S(B)=1$, $S(C)=2$, $S(D)=3$, $S(E)=1$.\nThe root state is fixed: $S(R)=1$.\nWe need to determine the states $S(N_1)$, $S(N_2)$, and $S(N_3)$ for the internal nodes.\n\nThe total cost, or tree length $L$, is the sum of elementary events over all branches. The cost of a branch connecting a parent node $p$ and a child node $c$ is given by $|S(p) - S(c)|$. The total cost is the sum of these costs over all eight branches of the tree:\n$$L = |S(R)-S(N_3)| + |S(R)-S(N_1)| + |S(N_3)-S(A)| + |S(N_3)-S(B)| + |S(N_1)-S(E)| + |S(N_1)-S(N_2)| + |S(N_2)-S(C)| + |S(N_2)-S(D)|$$\nSubstituting the known values for the root and the leaves:\n$$L = |1-S(N_3)| + |1-S(N_1)| + |S(N_3)-1| + |S(N_3)-1| + |S(N_1)-1| + |S(N_1)-S(N_2)| + |S(N_2)-2| + |S(N_2)-3|$$\nThis expression can be simplified by combining terms:\n$$L = 2|S(N_3)-1| + 2|S(N_1)-1| + |S(N_1)-S(N_2)| + |S(N_2)-2| + |S(N_2)-3|$$\nTo minimize $L$, we must find the integer states $S(N_1), S(N_2), S(N_3) \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ that minimize this function.\n\nThe term $2|S(N_3)-1|$ is minimized independently of the other states. Its minimum value is $0$, which occurs when $S(N_3)=1$.\n\nWe must now minimize the remaining part of the function, $f(S(N_1), S(N_2))$, which depends on the states of $N_1$ and $N_2$:\n$$f(S(N_1), S(N_2)) = 2|S(N_1)-1| + |S(N_1)-S(N_2)| + |S(N_2)-2| + |S(N_2)-3|$$\nWe can test all nine possible pairs of states for $(S(N_1), S(N_2))$:\n- If $S(N_1)=1$:\n  - $S(N_2)=1$: $f(1,1) = 2|1-1| + |1-1| + |1-2| + |1-3| = 0+0+1+2 = 3$.\n  - $S(N_2)=2$: $f(1,2) = 2|1-1| + |1-2| + |2-2| + |2-3| = 0+1+0+1 = 2$.\n  - $S(N_2)=3$: $f(1,3) = 2|1-1| + |1-3| + |3-2| + |3-3| = 0+2+1+0 = 3$.\n- If $S(N_1)=2$:\n  - $S(N_2)=1$: $f(2,1) = 2|2-1| + |2-1| + |1-2| + |1-3| = 2+1+1+2 = 6$.\n  - $S(N_2)=2$: $f(2,2) = 2|2-1| + |2-2| + |2-2| + |2-3| = 2+0+0+1 = 3$.\n  - $S(N_2)=3$: $f(2,3) = 2|2-1| + |2-3| + |3-2| + |3-3| = 2+1+1+0 = 4$.\n- If $S(N_1)=3$:\n  - $S(N_2)=1$: $f(3,1) = 2|3-1| + |3-1| + |1-2| + |1-3| = 4+2+1+2 = 9$.\n  - $S(N_2)=2$: $f(3,2) = 2|3-1| + |3-2| + |2-2| + |2-3| = 4+1+0+1 = 6$.\n  - $S(N_2)=3$: $f(3,3) = 2|3-1| + |3-3| + |3-2| + |3-3| = 4+0+1+0 = 5$.\n\nThe minimum value for $f(S(N_1), S(N_2))$ is $2$, and this minimum is achieved uniquely when $S(N_1)=1$ and $S(N_2)=2$.\nThus, the most parsimonious reconstruction is unique and is given by the following internal node states:\n$S(N_3)=1$, $S(N_1)=1$, $S(N_2)=2$.\n\nWith this complete and unique state reconstruction, we can now count the number of fission and fusion events. A fission event is a change of $s \\to s+1$, and a fusion event is a change of $s \\to s-1$. We examine each branch of the tree for changes.\n- Branch $R \\to N_3$: $S(R)=1 \\to S(N_3)=1$.

This corresponds to a change of $+1$, which is one fission event.\n- Branch $N_2 \\to C$: $S(N_2)=2 \\to S(C)=2$. Change is $0$.\n- Branch $N_2 \\to D$: $S(N_2)=2 \\to S(D)=3$. This corresponds to a change of $+1$, which is one fission event.\n\nSumming these events across the entire tree:\n- Total number of fissions: $1$ (on branch $N_1 \\to N_2$) + $1$ (on branch $N_2 \\to D$) = $2$.\n- Total number of fusions: $0$.\n\nThe minimal number of events required to explain the data is $2+0=2$, which matches our minimum cost calculation $L_{min} = 0 + 2 = 2$.\nThe final answer is the number of fissions and fusions, reported as a row matrix.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2636292"}, {"introduction": "Following gene duplication events, which are a major source of Hox cluster expansion, the resulting paralogous genes evolve under different selective pressures.

Using the logarithmic identity $-\\ln(y) = \\ln(1/y)$, we can write the expression in a more direct form:\n$$x^{\\ast} = -\\frac{1}{k} \\ln \\left[ \\frac{K_{d}}{C_0} \\left( \\frac{p^{\\ast}}{1 - p^{\\ast}} \\right)^{1/n} \\right]$$\n$$x^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{k} \\ln \\left[ \\left( \\frac{K_{d}}{C_0} \\left( \\frac{p^{\\ast}}{1 - p^{\\ast}} \\right)^{1/n} \\right)^{-1} \\right]$$\n$$x^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{k} \\ln \\left[ \\frac{C_0}{K_{d}} \\left( \\frac{1 - p^{\\ast}}{p^{\\ast}} \\right)^{1/n} \\right]$$\nThis is the general analytical expression for the boundary position $x^{\\ast}$.\n\nNow, we are required to evaluate this expression for the given parameters: $C_0 = 80 \\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $k = 1.1 \\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-1}$, $K_d = 10 \\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $n = 2$, and $p^{\\ast} = 0.7$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$x^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{1.1} \\ln \\left[ \\frac{80}{10} \\left( \\frac{1 - 0.7}{0.7} \\right)^{1/2} \\right]$$\nWe simplify the argument of the logarithm:\n$$x^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{1.1} \\ln \\left[ 8 \\left( \\frac{0.3}{0.7} \\right)^{1/2} \\right]$$\n$$x^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{1.1} \\ln \\left[ 8 \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}} \\right]$$\nWe proceed with the numerical calculation.\nThe argument of the logarithm is $8 \\sqrt{3/7} \\approx 8 \\times 0.65465367 \\approx 5.23722936$.\nThe natural logarithm of this value is $\\ln(5.23722936) \\approx 1.6558325$.\nFinally, we divide by the decay constant $k$:\n$$x^{\\ast} \\approx \\frac{1.6558325}{1.1} \\approx 1.50530227 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nThe problem specifies rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$x^{\\ast} \\approx 1.505 \\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nThe units are consistent: the concentration units for $C_0$ and $K_d$ cancel, and the reciprocal unit of $k$ ($mm^{-1}$) results in a final unit of length ($mm$) for $x^{\\ast}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.505}\n$$", "id": "2636318"}]}
