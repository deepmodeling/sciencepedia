The process relies on a powerful logical framework built on necessity, sufficiency, and epistasis tests to order genes within a causal pathway. This practice simulates a core task for a developmental geneticist: designing a series of experiments to confidently place a new gene into the existing retinal determination network, thereby honing your ability to build and critique evidence-based models of gene function [@problem_id:2627144].", "problem": "A team working on retinal determination in Drosophila seeks to place twin of eyeless (toy) relative to eyeless (ey), sine oculis (so), and eyes absent (eya) within the eye gene regulatory network (GRN). They will use classical epistasis logic with loss-of-function and gain-of-function alleles and rely on causal inference from necessity and sufficiency tests. Assume the following foundational principles: the Central Dogma of molecular biology (deoxyribonucleic acid to ribonucleic acid to protein), that spatial patterns of transcription factor activity specify cell fates, and that, in developmental genetics, a gene that is necessary for the expression of a second gene is typically upstream of that second gene in a linear pathway, while sufficiency tests via ectopic expression infer the direction of regulatory influence if downstream nodes are necessary for the phenotype. Also assume the following tools are available: the yeast Gal4 transcription factor/Upstream Activating Sequence (UAS) binary expression system, RNA interference (RNAi) for knockdown, clonal analysis with mitotic recombination, and transcriptional reporters for ey, so, and eya. The team will score outcomes by reporter expression and by the production of ectopic eye tissue upon misexpression in non-retinal imaginal tissue.\n\nWhich experimental design and outcome set most convincingly positions toy relative to ey, so, and eya in the GRN?\n\nA. Design: Generate toy null clones in the early eye disc and assay the ey reporter; generate ey null clones and assay the toy reporter; assay so and eya reporters in each background; perform ectopic misexpression with dpp-Gal4 UAS-toy and UAS-ey in antennal discs; test epistasis by combining misexpression with loss-of-function. Predicted outcomes: toy null clones abolish ey reporter, while ey null clones leave toy reporter intact; so and eya reporters are lost in ey null clones but retained in toy null clones only if ey is co-expressed; dpp-Gal4 driving UAS-toy induces ectopic ey followed by so and eya in wild-type but fails to induce ectopic eyes in an ey null background; dpp-Gal4 driving UAS-ey still induces ectopic so and eya and ectopic eyes in a toy null background; coexpression of UAS-eya and UAS-so induces ectopic eyes even in an ey null background. Inference: toy is upstream of ey, and ey is upstream of so and eya; the so–eya complex is downstream and can bypass ey when forcibly expressed.\n\nB. Design: Knock down ey by RNA interference (RNAi) with a pan-disc driver and assay toy, so, and eya reporters; misexpress toy broadly and test if it rescues the ey RNAi phenotype; misexpress so alone in an ey null background. Predicted outcomes: ey RNAi reduces toy reporter; misexpressed toy rescues ey RNAi eye defects and restores so and eya; so alone is sufficient to induce ectopic eyes without ey. Inference: ey is upstream of toy, and so is downstream of both but sufficient on its own.\n\nC. Design: Create double loss-of-function clones for toy and ey in the eye disc; misexpress toy or ey individually with dpp-Gal4 in antennal discs; assay so and eya reporters. Predicted outcomes: the double mutant abolishes all reporter expression; misexpression of toy induces so and eya even when ey function is removed, and misexpression of ey induces so and eya even when toy is removed; neither misexpression rescues the double mutant phenotype; coexpression of eya and so does not induce eyes without ey. Inference: toy and ey act in parallel upstream of so and eya, and downstream nodes cannot bypass their combined requirement.\n\nD. Design: Generate eya null clones and assay ey and so reporters; misexpress eya with dpp-Gal4 and test induction of ey and so; combine UAS-eya misexpression with toy null mutants. Predicted outcomes: eya null abolishes ey but not so reporter; misexpressed eya induces ey and so in antennal discs; misexpressed eya fails to induce ectopic eyes in a toy null background. Inference: eya is upstream of ey, so is parallel, and toy is required permissively for eya function.\n\nSelect the option whose experimental plan and predicted outcomes best satisfy epistasis logic for ordering genes in a linear or feed-forward GRN and would allow assignment of toy relative to ey, so, and eya with the strongest causal inference.", "solution": "The problem statement is a valid exercise in evaluating experimental design and causal inference in developmental genetics. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a clear goal—to place the gene *twin of eyeless* (*toy*) within the eye gene regulatory network (GRN)—and provides the necessary context, tools, and assumptions for a rigorous analysis. The core of the task is to apply the principles of epistasis analysis, including necessity and sufficiency tests, to determine which of the proposed experimental plans offers the most convincing evidence to establish a gene's position in a hierarchy.\n\nA valid epistasis analysis for ordering genes in a linear pathway, for instance $A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow \\text{phenotype}$, must combine loss-of-function (LOF) and gain-of-function (GOF) experiments in a specific, logical manner.\n$1$. **Necessity:** The LOF of the upstream gene $A$ should block the function or expression of the downstream gene $B$. Conversely, the LOF of $B$ should have no effect on $A$.\n$2$. **Sufficiency:** The GOF of $A$ should be sufficient to induce the expression of $B$ and the final phenotype.\n$3$. **Epistasis:** The crucial test involves combining LOF and GOF. GOF of the upstream gene $A$ should fail to produce the phenotype in a background that has a LOF of the downstream gene $B$. Conversely, GOF of the downstream gene $B$ should be able to produce the phenotype even in a background with a LOF of the upstream gene $A$ (this is often called a \"rescue\" or \"bypass\" experiment). The phenotype of the double mutant $A, B$ should resemble the phenotype of the downstream gene's mutant, $B$.\n\nWe will evaluate each option based on its adherence to this rigorous logical framework. The known, simplified core of the network is *eyeless* (*ey*) → {*sine oculis* (*so*), *eyes absent* (*eya*)}. The goal is to place *toy* relative to this core.\n\n**Option A: Analysis**\n- **Experimental Design:** This option proposes a comprehensive and systematic plan. It includes:\n    - Reciprocal necessity tests using null clones (*toy* null tested for *ey* expression, and *ey* null tested for *toy* expression). Clonal analysis is a precise method for assessing cell-autonomous requirements.\n    - Sufficiency tests using the $Gal4/UAS$ system ($UAS-toy$ and $UAS-ey$).\n    - The definitive reciprocal epistasis tests: misexpressing the putative upstream gene in the putative downstream gene's null background ($UAS-toy$ in an *ey* null background) and vice versa ($UAS-ey$ in a *toy* null background).\n    - An important control experiment confirming the known relationship between *so*/*eya* and *ey*.\n- **Predicted Outcomes and Inference:** The outcomes are internally consistent and logically support the final inference.\n    - *toy* null clones abolish *ey* reporter, while *ey* null clones leave *toy* reporter intact $\\implies$ *toy* is necessary for *ey* expression, but not vice-versa. This establishes the order *toy* → *ey*.\n    - $dpp-Gal4$ driving $UAS-toy$ induces ectopic *ey* $\\implies$ *toy* is sufficient to activate *ey*.\n    - $dpp-Gal4$ driving $UAS-toy$ ... fails to induce ectopic eyes in an *ey* null background $\\implies$ *ey* is necessary downstream of *toy*.\n    - $dpp-Gal4$ driving $UAS-ey$ still induces ectopic eyes in a *toy* null background $\\implies$ *ey* can function without *toy* (it bypasses the LOF of the upstream gene).\n    - These results synergize to provide overwhelming evidence for the linear pathway: *toy* → *ey* → *so*/*eya*. The prediction that *so*–*eya* coexpression can bypass *ey* aligns with established findings, adding to the credibility of the entire proposed logical structure.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. This option represents the gold standard for genetic pathway analysis. The experimental design is rigorous, and the predicted outcomes lead to a strong, unambiguous conclusion.\n\n**Option B: Analysis**\n- **Experimental Design:** This design is less rigorous than A. It relies on RNAi, which can suffer from incomplete knockdown and off-target effects, making it less precise than null alleles for necessity tests. It lacks the critical reciprocal tests present in A.\n- **Predicted Outcomes and Inference:** The outcomes are problematic.\n    - *ey* RNAi reduces *toy* reporter suggests *ey* → *toy* or a feedback loop, which contradicts the model from A.\n    - misexpressed *toy* rescues *ey* RNAi eye defects is difficult to interpret. Rescuing an upstream defect with a downstream gene is not typical for a simple linear pathway, unless the knockdown is partial and the GOF of the downstream gene is potent enough to function with reduced upstream input. This result is ambiguous.\n    - *so* alone is sufficient to induce ectopic eyes without *ey* is a factually incorrect statement based on the known biology of the eye GRN. Co-expression of *so* and *eya* is required to bypass an *ey* requirement.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect. The experimental design is weaker than A's, and the predicted outcomes are a mixture of ambiguous and factually incorrect statements, leading to a weak and likely erroneous inference.\n\n**Option C: Analysis**\n- **Experimental Design:** This design focuses on a double LOF mutant and individual misexpressions to test a parallel pathway model.\n- **Predicted Outcomes and Inference:** The outcomes are logically contradictory and factually unsound.\n    - The predictions that $UAS-toy$ can induce *so*/*eya* without *ey*, and $UAS-ey$ can induce *so*/*eya* without *toy*, logically support a parallel model where both *toy* and *ey* converge on *so*/*eya*.\n    - However, the prediction that neither misexpression rescues the double mutant phenotype directly contradicts this. If $UAS-ey$ is sufficient to activate *so*/*eya* and downstream events in the absence of *toy*, it must be able to rescue the phenotype of an animal lacking both *toy* and *ey* function in the cells where $UAS-ey$ is expressed. This is a severe internal contradiction.\n    - Furthermore, the statement coexpression of *eya* and *so* does not induce eyes without *ey* is factually incorrect, as established in option B's analysis.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect. The set of predicted outcomes is internally contradictory and contains factually incorrect information, rendering the entire proposal invalid as a \"convincing\" argument.\n\n**Option D: Analysis**\n- **Experimental Design:** This design focuses on testing a non-canonical hierarchy where *eya* is upstream of *ey*. While testing alternative hypotheses is valid, the primary goal is to place *toy*. This design focuses excessively on re-ordering the known core of the network rather than directly testing *toy*'s position relative to it.\n- **Predicted Outcomes and Inference:** The predicted outcomes support a convoluted and unlikely model.\n    - *eya* null abolishes *ey* but not *so* reporter implies a strange branching pathway where *eya* is upstream of *ey*, but *so* is regulated independently. This is not parsimonious.\n    - The inference that *eya* is upstream of *ey* overturns a large body of evidence without a compelling reason within the problem context.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect. This experimental design is not the most direct or efficient way to solve the stated problem (placing *toy*). The resulting model is complex and deviates from the well-supported canonical pathway without sufficient justification. Compared to the clear, systematic, and decisive approach in A, this option is far less \"convincing.\"\n\n**Conclusion**\nOption A provides the most compelling and logically sound framework. It employs a complete set of reciprocal necessity and epistasis tests using the most precise genetic tools available (clonal analysis for LOF). The predicted outcomes are internally consistent and converge on a single, clear, and unambiguous model of a linear gene hierarchy.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular biology and gene regulation, using the standard Hill function to model cooperative transcription factor binding. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and a clear objective. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of the fold-change in transcriptional output, $R$, of a Pax6-regulated gene when the concentration of the transcription factor Pax6 is halved from its initial value. The transcriptional response is modeled by the Hill activation function:\n$$\nf(X) = \\frac{X^{n}}{K^{n} + X^{n}}\n$$\nwhere $X$ is the nuclear concentration of Pax6, $K$ is the activation constant, and $n$ is the Hill coefficient.\n\nWe are given the following parameters:\nThe Hill coefficient is $n=2$.\nThe initial concentration of Pax6 is $X_{\\text{before}} = K$.\nThe final concentration, after halving the gene dosage, is $X_{\\text{after}} = \\frac{K}{2}$.\n\nFirst, we substitute the given Hill coefficient $n=2$ into the general function to obtain the specific response function for this system:\n$$\nf(X) = \\frac{X^{2}}{K^{2} + X^{2}}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the transcriptional output at the initial concentration, $X_{\\text{before}} = K$. This corresponds to the state where the system is at its half-maximal activation point by definition.\n$$\nf(X_{\\text{before}}) = f(K) = \\frac{K^{2}}{K^{2} + K^{2}} = \\frac{K^{2}}{2K^{2}} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThis result confirms that when $X=K$, the transcriptional output is at $50\\%$ of its maximum possible level, consistent with the definition of $K$.\n\nNow, we calculate the transcriptional output at the final concentration, $X_{\\text{after}} = \\frac{K}{2}$, which represents the effect of haploinsufficiency (halving the gene dosage).\n$$\nf(X_{\\text{after}}) = f\\left(\\frac{K}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{K}{2}\\right)^{2}}{K^{2} + \\left(\\frac{K}{2}\\right)^{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{K^{2}}{4}}{K^{2} + \\frac{K^{2}}{4}}\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we find a common denominator for the terms in the main denominator:\n$$\nf\\left(\\frac{K}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\frac{K^{2}}{4}}{\\frac{4K^{2}}{4} + \\frac{K^{2}}{4}} = \\frac{\\frac{K^{2}}{4}}{\\frac{5K^{2}}{4}}\n$$\nWe can cancel the common terms $\\frac{K^{2}}{4}$ from the numerator and the denominator, which yields:\n$$\nf(X_{\\text{after}}) = \\frac{1}{5}\n$$\nThe problem defines the fold-change $R$ as the ratio of the final transcriptional output to the initial output:\n$$\nR = \\frac{f(X_{\\text{after}})}{f(X_{\\text{before}})}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values into this definition:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\frac{1}{5}}{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{2}{1} = \\frac{2}{5}\n$$\nThus, halving the Pax6 concentration from $X=K$ to $X=K/2$ results in the transcriptional output dropping to $\\frac{2}{5}$ of its initial level.\n\nThis calculation illustrates the concept of threshold-like behavior, which is a direct consequence of cooperative binding modeled by a Hill coefficient $n>1$. Here, with $n=2$, the response curve of $f(X)$ versus $X$ is sigmoidal (S-shaped), not hyperbolic as it would be for non-cooperative binding ($n=1$). The steepness of this sigmoidal curve is maximal around the point $X=K$. This property creates a \"switch-like\" or \"threshold\" response: for concentrations $X \\ll K$, the gene is essentially \"off\" ($f(X) \\approx 0$), and for concentrations $X \\gg K$, the gene is \"on\" ($f(X) \\approx 1$). In the vicinity of $X=K$, small changes in the concentration of the transcription factor lead to disproportionately large changes in gene expression.\n\nOur result demonstrates this sensitivity. A $50\\%$ reduction in the concentration of Pax6 (from $K$ to $\\frac{K}{2}$) does not lead to a $50\\%$ reduction in expression. Instead, the expression drops from an initial level of $f(K) = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$ to a final level of $f(\\frac{K}{2}) = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$. The final expression is only $R = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4$ of the initial expression, which is a $60\\%$ reduction in output from a $50\\%$ reduction in input concentration. This ultrasensitivity is characteristic of cooperative systems where multiple transcription factor molecules (in this case, modeled by $n=2$, suggesting dimeric binding or two binding events) must bind to the gene's promoter region to achieve efficient activation. The binding of the first molecule facilitates the binding of the second, leading to a sharp transition from a low to a high transcription state as the concentration crosses the threshold $K$. This mechanism is fundamental in developmental biology for establishing sharp spatial boundaries and ensuring robust cell fate decisions based on graded morphogen or transcription factor concentrations.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}\n$$", "id": "2627106"}, {"introduction": "In the era of genomics, reconstructing GRNs has evolved into a systems-level challenge of integrating vast, multi-modal datasets.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of developmental and molecular biology, well-posed with a complete and consistent set of definitions and constraints, and formulated with objective, precise language. All necessary data, thresholds, and mathematical rules are provided to construct a deterministic algorithm. There are no violations of scientific or logical principles.\n\nThe task is to construct a decision algorithm for in-ferring directed, signed regulatory edges from the transcription factor Pax6 to a target gene. The algorithm must synthesize evidence from multiple high-throughput sequencing experiments (ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, RNA-seq) and other bioinformatics sources. The logic is derived from fundamental principles of gene regulation.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds in a cascading, three-stage decision process for each candidate Pax6 $\\to$ gene interaction, which is defined by a set of seven evidence variables: $b$ (binding), $a$ (accessibility), $e$ (expression change), $t$ (temporal precedence), $m$ (motif), $c$ (conservation), and $l$ (linkage).\n\n**Stage 1: Application of Hard Filters (Necessary Conditions)**\n\nFor a direct regulatory interaction to be plausible, several non-negotiable conditions must be met, which act as hard filters. These are derived directly from the biophysical requirements of transcription factor action.\n1.  **Sufficient TF Occupancy**: The transcription factor must physically bind to a cis-regulatory element. This is captured by the ChIP-seq binding strength $b$ and the presence of a binding motif $m$.\n    - Condition 1: $b \\ge b_{\\min}$, where $b_{\\min} = 0.4$.\n    - Condition 2: $m \\ge m_{\\min}$, where $m_{\\min} = 0.5$.\n2.  **Accessible Chromatin**: The regulatory element must be in an open or accessible chromatin state for the transcription factor to bind. This is measured by the ATAC-seq accessibility score $a$.\n    - Condition 3: $a \\ge a_{\\min}$, where $a_{\\min} = 0.3$.\n3.  **Measurable Functional Effect**: A direct regulatory interaction must produce a detectable change in the target gene's expression level upon perturbation of the regulator. This is quantified by the log$_2$ fold-change $e$ from an RNA-seq experiment comparing Pax6 loss-of-function (LOF) to a control.\n    - Condition 4: $|e| \\ge e_{\\min}$, where $e_{\\min} = 0.1$.\n\nIf any of these four conditions are not met, the candidate edge is immediately discarded, and the output for that gene is $0$.\n\n**Stage 2: Integration of Evidence (Sufficient Condition)**\n\nIf all hard filters are passed, the remaining evidence variables are integrated into a single quantitative score, $S$. This score represents the total weight of evidence supporting a causal regulatory link. The score is a convex combination of the normalized evidence variables, where the weights $\\{w_i\\}$ reflect the perceived relative importance of each data type.\nThe score $S$ is calculated as:\n$$S = w_b\\,b + w_a\\,a + w_e\\,|e| + w_t\\,t + w_m\\,m + w_c\\,c + w_l\\,l$$\nUsing the provided weights:\n$$w_b = 0.3, w_a = 0.15, w_e = 0.2, w_t = 0.15, w_m = 0.1, w_c = 0.05, w_l = 0.05$$\nAn edge is considered to have sufficient evidence only if this integrated score exceeds a specified threshold, $\\tau$.\n- Condition 5: $S > \\tau$, where $\\tau = 0.6$.\n\nIf $S \\le \\tau$, the evidence is deemed insufficient, and the output is $0$.\n\n**Stage 3: Assignment of Edge Sign**\n\nIf an edge is called (i.e., all hard filters are passed and $S > \\tau$), its sign (activation or repression) is determined from the LOF experiment.\n- If $e < 0$, the loss of Pax6 leads to a decrease in target gene expression. This implies Pax6 is an **activator**. The output is $+1$.\n- If $e > 0$, the loss of Pax6 leads to an increase in target gene expression (disinhibition). This implies Pax6 is a **repressor**. The output is $-1$.\n\nThe final output is one of three integer values: $+1$ (activation), $-1$ (repression), or $0$ (no direct edge called).\n\n**Illustrative Application of the Algorithm**\n\nLet us apply this algorithm to two test cases from the problem statement.\n\n**Case 1:** Input tuple $(b, a, e, t, m, c, l) = (0.9, 0.8, -1.2, 0.9, 1.0, 0.8, 0.7)$.\n- **Stage 1 (Filters):**\n    - $b = 0.9 \\ge 0.4$ (Pass)\n    - $m = 1.0 \\ge 0.5$ (Pass)\n    - $a = 0.8 \\ge 0.3$ (Pass)\n    - $|e| = |-1.2| = 1.2 \\ge 0.1$ (Pass)\n    All hard filters are satisfied.

Since $0.94 > 0.6$, this condition is passed. Proceed to Stage 3.\n- **Stage 3 (Sign):**\n    The expression change is $e = -1.2$. Since $e < 0$, Pax6 is an activator.\n- **Result for Case 1:** $+1$.\n\n**Case 4:** Input tuple $(b, a, e, t, m, c, l) = (0.9, 0.9, -1.0, 0.9, 0.4, 0.9, 0.9)$.\n- **Stage 1 (Filters):**\n    - $b = 0.9 \\ge 0.4$ (Pass)\n    - $m = 0.4 \\not\\ge 0.5$ (Fail)\n    The candidate interaction fails the motif score filter. The algorithm terminates here for this case.\n- **Result for Case 4:** $0$.\n\nThis complete decision logic is implemented in the provided program to evaluate all eight test cases.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements a decision algorithm to infer directed, signed regulatory edges\n    from Pax6 to target genes based on multi-omics evidence.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case is a tuple: (b, a, e, t, m, c, l)\n    test_cases = [\n        (0.9, 0.8, -1.2, 0.9, 1.0, 0.8, 0.7),   # Case 1\n        (0.85, 0.7, 0.8, 0.8, 0.9, 0.6, 0.6),   # Case 2\n        (0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6),   # Case 3\n        (0.9, 0.9, -1.0, 0.9, 0.4, 0.9, 0.9),   # Case 4\n        (0.95, 0.2, -0.8, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9),   # Case 5\n        (0.4, 0.5, -1.0, 0.8, 0.7, 0.0, 0.8),   # Case 6\n        (0.9, 0.9, 0.05, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9),   # Case 7\n        (0.7, 0.3, 0.6, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.9),   # Case 8\n    ]\n\n    # Define constants and parameters for the decision rule.\n    b_min = 0.4\n    a_min = 0.3\n    m_min = 0.5\n    e_min = 0.1\n    tau = 0.6\n\n    weights = {\n        'b': 0.3,\n        'a': 0.15,\n        'e': 0.2,\n        't': 0.15,\n        'm': 0.1,\n        'c': 0.05,\n        'l': 0.05,\n    }\n\n    def decide_edge(b, a, e, t, m, c, l):\n        \"\"\"\n        Applies the full decision logic for a single candidate edge.\n\n        Returns:\n            int: 1 for activation, -1 for repression, 0 for no edge.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Stage 1: Apply hard filters\n        if not (b >= b_min):\n            return 0\n        if not (a >= a_min):\n            return 0\n        if not (m >= m_min):\n            return 0\n        if not (np.abs(e) >= e_min):\n            return 0\n\n        # Stage 2: Integrate evidence into a score\n        score = (weights['b'] * b +\n                 weights['a'] * a +\n                 weights['e'] * np.abs(e) +\n                 weights['t'] * t +\n                 weights['m'] * m +\n                 weights['c'] * c +\n                 weights['l'] * l)\n\n        # Check score against threshold (sufficient condition)\n        if not (score > tau):\n            return 0\n\n        # Stage 3: Assign edge sign based on expression change\n        if e  0:\n            return 1  # Activator\n        elif e > 0:\n            return -1 # Repressor\n        else:\n            # This case is logically unreachable due to the |e| >= e_min filter\n            # where e_min > 0, but included for completeness.\n            return 0\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        b, a, e, t, m, c, l = case\n        result = decide_edge(b, a, e, t, m, c, l)\n        results.append(result)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2627104"}]}
