By working through the calculation, you will establish the direct mathematical link between the physical properties of the morphogen profile and the biochemical thresholds of the genes that interpret it [@problem_id:2663363].", "problem": "A one-dimensional tissue of length $L$ is patterned by a single morphogen produced at the anterior boundary $x=0$ and degraded uniformly in the tissue. In the experimentally established steady state of such diffusion-degradation systems, the morphogen concentration profile along the anterior-posterior axis is well described by an exponential function $c(x)=A\\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, where $A$ is a source amplitude set by production at $x=0$, and $\\lambda$ is the decay length. Consider three downstream genes, $G_A$, $G_B$, and $G_C$, each reading out the morphogen through a standard activating Hill function $r_i(c)=\\dfrac{c^{n_i}}{K_i^{n_i}+c^{n_i}}$ with Hill coefficient $n_i$ and half-activation constant $K_i$ for $i\\in\\{A,B,C\\}$. Suppose the cell adopts three distinct and ordered fates along the axis according to the following rule: Fate $1$ is specified where $r_A(c)>1/2$, Fate $2$ where $r_A(c)\\le 1/2$ and $r_B(c)>1/2$, and Fate $3$ where $r_B(c)\\le 1/2$ and $r_C(c)>1/2$. Assume $K_A>K_B>K_C$ so that fates are potentially ordered from anterior to posterior as the morphogen decays.\n\nYou are given the following parameter values: $L=900\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $\\lambda=250\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $n_A=2$, $n_B=2$, $n_C=2$, $K_A=75\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $K_B=20\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $K_C=4.8\\,\\mathrm{nM}$. The amplitude $A$ is not fixed a priori and can vary with the total morphogen production rate at the source.\n\nStarting from first principles about threshold crossings in Hill functions and the exponential morphogen profile, determine whether at least three distinct, ordered fates can be specified somewhere within the tissue by an appropriate choice of $A$, and then compute the minimal morphogen dynamic range across the tissue that is required to realize such a three-fate pattern. Here, define the morphogen dynamic range across the tissue as $R=\\dfrac{c(0)}{c(L)}$ and define the minimal dynamic range required, $R_{\\min}$, as the smallest fold-change between anterior and posterior morphogen concentrations that permits all three fate territories to exist within $0\\le x\\le L$ for some $A$.\n\nReport $R_{\\min}$ as a pure number (fold-change, no units). Round your answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem statement describes a classic model of positional information in developmental biology, where a morphogen gradient patterns a one-dimensional tissue. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary parameters are provided. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe fate of a cell is determined by the expression of three genes, $G_A$, $G_B$, and $G_C$. The expression response of each gene $i$ to the morphogen concentration $c$ is given by a Hill function, $r_i(c) = \\dfrac{c^{n_i}}{K_i^{n_i}+c^{n_i}}$. A gene is considered active if its response level exceeds a threshold of $1/2$. The condition for activation is therefore $r_i(c) > 1/2$. Let us determine the concentration threshold for this activation:\n$$\nr_i(c) = \\frac{c^{n_i}}{K_i^{n_i} + c^{n_i}} > \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThis inequality can be rearranged:\n$$\n2c^{n_i} > K_i^{n_i} + c^{n_i}\n$$\n$$\nc^{n_i} > K_i^{n_i}\n$$\nSince both concentration $c$ and the half-activation constant $K_i$ are positive real numbers, this simplifies to:\n$$\nc > K_i\n$$\nThis means that a gene $i$ is active when the local morphogen concentration is greater than its half-activation constant $K_i$. This result holds for any positive Hill coefficient $n_i$.\n\nThe rules for fate specification can now be expressed as conditions on the local morphogen concentration $c(x)$:\n- **Fate 1:** $r_A(c) > 1/2 \\implies c(x) > K_A$.\n- **Fate 2:** $r_A(c) \\le 1/2$ and $r_B(c) > 1/2 \\implies c(x) \\le K_A$ and $c(x) > K_B$. This corresponds to the concentration range $K_B < c(x) \\le K_A$.\n- **Fate 3:** $r_B(c) \\le 1/2$ and $r_C(c) > 1/2 \\implies c(x) \\le K_B$ and $c(x) > K_C$. This corresponds to the concentration range $K_C < c(x) \\le K_B$.\n\nThe morphogen concentration profile along the tissue is given by $c(x) = A\\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, where $x=0$ is the anterior boundary and $x=L$ is the posterior boundary. The concentration is maximal at the source, $c(0) = A$, and decays exponentially to its minimum value at the end of the tissue, $c(L) = A\\exp(-L/\\lambda)$.\n\nFor all three fates to be specified as distinct territories within the tissue, the concentration profile must span a range that allows all three threshold conditions to be met. Specifically:\n1.  A region of Fate $1$ must exist. This requires the concentration somewhere in the tissue to be greater than $K_A$. The highest concentration is $c(0)$, so we must have $c(0) > K_A$. This implies the source amplitude must satisfy $A > K_A$.\n2.  A region of Fate $3$ must exist. This requires the concentration somewhere to be in the range $(K_C, K_B]$. For this entire fate territory to be defined within the tissue of length $L$, the position $x_C$ where the concentration drops to $K_C$ must be less than $L$. This, in turn, implies that the concentration at the very end of the tissue, $c(L)$, must be less than $K_C$. Thus, we must have $c(L) < K_C$.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $c(0)$ and $c(L)$, we obtain a set of constraints on the amplitude $A$:\n1. $A > K_A$\n2. $A\\exp(-L/\\lambda) < K_C \\implies A < K_C \\exp(L/\\lambda)$\n\nFor a three-fate pattern to be possible, there must exist a value of $A$ that satisfies both inequalities simultaneously. This requires that the lower bound for $A$ is less than the upper bound:\n$$\nK_A < K_C \\exp(L/\\lambda)\n$$\nThis fundamental inequality can be rearranged to place a condition on the system's physical parameters ($L$, $\\lambda$) relative to its biochemical parameters ($K_A$, $K_C$):\n$$\n\\exp\\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda}\\right) > \\frac{K_A}{K_C}\n$$\n\nThe problem defines the morphogen dynamic range across the tissue as $R = \\dfrac{c(0)}{c(L)}$. We can calculate this ratio from the concentration profile:\n$$\nR = \\frac{A \\exp(-0/\\lambda)}{A \\exp(-L/\\lambda)} = \\frac{A}{A \\exp(-L/\\lambda)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this definition of $R$ into the inequality, we find the condition for successful patterning:\n$$\nR > \\frac{K_A}{K_C}\n$$\nThis shows that the dynamic range of the morphogen across the tissue must be greater than the ratio of the highest to the lowest concentration thresholds.\n\nFirst, we check if this condition is met for the given parameters, which will answer the first part of the question.\nGiven: $L=900\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $\\lambda=250\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $K_A=75\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $K_C=4.8\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\nThe actual dynamic range is $R = \\exp\\left(\\frac{900}{250}\\right) = \\exp(3.6) \\approx 36.598$.\nThe required ratio of thresholds is $\\frac{K_A}{K_C} = \\frac{75}{4.8} = 15.625$.\nSince $R \\approx 36.598$ is indeed greater than $15.625$, a three-fate pattern can be specified.\n\nThe second part of the question asks for the minimal required dynamic range, $R_{\\min}$. This is the smallest value of $R$ for which patterning is possible. From the condition $R > K_A/K_C$, it is clear that the boundary case occurs when the dynamic range is just sufficient to span the thresholds. Therefore, the minimal required dynamic range is given by this threshold ratio:\n$$\nR_{\\min} = \\frac{K_A}{K_C}\n$$\nThis quantity represents a fundamental constraint imposed by the gene regulatory network, independent of the specific physical dimensions of the tissue in this particular problem.\n\nWe calculate this value using the supplied constants:\n$$\nR_{\\min} = \\frac{75}{4.8} = 15.625\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nR_{\\min} \\approx 15.6\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{15.6}\n$$", "id": "2663363"}, {"introduction": "Once a pattern is established, its developmental utility depends on its precision.
