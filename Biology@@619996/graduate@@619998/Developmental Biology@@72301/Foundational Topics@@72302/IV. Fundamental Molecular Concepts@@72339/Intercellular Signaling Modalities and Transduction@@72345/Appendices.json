We must find the maximum of $C(d, t)$ with respect to time $t$. We compute the derivative of $C(d, t)$ with respect to $t$ and set it to zero:\n$$\\frac{\\partial C(d, t)}{\\partial t} = N_{\\text{para}} (4 \\pi D)^{-3/2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left( t^{-3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{d^2}{4Dt}\\right) \\right) = 0$$\nUsing the product rule for differentiation:\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}t^{-5/2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{d^2}{4Dt}\\right) + t^{-3/2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{d^2}{4Dt}\\right)\\left(\\frac{d^2}{4Dt^2}\\right) = 0$$\nDividing by common non-zero terms yields:\n$$-\\frac{3}{2t} + \\frac{d^2}{4Dt^2} = 0$$\nSolving for the time of maximum concentration, $t_{\\text{max}}$:\n$$t_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{d^2}{6D}$$\nNow, we substitute $t_{\\text{max}}$ back into the concentration equation to find the maximum concentration, $C_{\\text{max}}(d)$.\n$$C_{\\text{max}}(d) = \\frac{N_{\\text{para}}}{(4 \\pi D \\frac{d^2}{6D})^{3/2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{d^2}{4D \\frac{d^2}{6D}}\\right)$$\nThe diffusion coefficient $D$ cancels out, as anticipated:\n$$C_{\\text{max}}(d) = \\frac{N_{\\text{para}}}{(\\frac{2 \\pi d^2}{3})^{3/2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)$$\nThis expression can be written as:\n$$C_{\\text{max}}(d) = N_{\\text{para}} \\left(\\frac{3}{2 \\pi e d^2}\\right)^{3/2}$$\nWe set this maximum concentration equal to the target concentration $C^\\ast$:\n$$C^\\ast = N_{\\text{para}} \\left(\\frac{3}{2 \\pi e d^2}\\right)^{3/2}$$\nSolving for the number of paracrine molecules, $N_{\\text{para}}$:\n$$N_{\\text{para}} = C^\\ast \\left(\\frac{2 \\pi e d^2}{3}\\right)^{3/2}$$\nWe can now compute the ratio $R = N_{\\text{para}} / N_{\\text{syn}}$:\n$$R = \\frac{N_{\\text{para}}}{N_{\\text{syn}}} = \\frac{C^\\ast \\left(\\frac{2 \\pi e d^2}{3}\\right)^{3/2}}{C^\\ast A h}$$\nThe term $C^\\ast$ cancels, indicating that the ratio is independent of the specific target occupancy $f^\\ast$ and the receptor dissociation constant $K_d$.\n$$R = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi e d^2}{3}\\right)^{3/2}}{A h}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $d = 50\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, $A = 0.20\\,\\mu\\text{m}^2$, and $h = 0.020\\,\\mu\\text{m}$. All units are consistent, so the ratio will be dimensionless.\nThe denominator is the synaptic volume:\n$$A h = (0.20\\,\\mu\\text{m}^2) \\times (0.020\\,\\mu\\text{m}) = 0.0040\\,\\mu\\text{m}^3$$\nThe term in the numerator's parenthesis is:\n$$\\frac{2 \\pi e d^2}{3} = \\frac{2 \\pi e (50\\,\\mu\\text{m})^2}{3} = \\frac{2 \\pi e (2500\\,\\mu\\text{m}^2)}{3} = \\frac{5000 \\pi e}{3}\\,\\mu\\text{m}^2$$\nNow we compute the value of the numerator:\n$$\\left(\\frac{5000 \\pi e}{3}\\right)^{3/2} (\\mu\\text{m}^2)^{3/2} \\approx (14233.50)^{3/2}\\,\\mu\\text{m}^3 \\approx 1698218\\,\\mu\\text{m}^3$$\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{1698218\\,\\mu\\text{m}^3}{0.0040\\,\\mu\\text{m}^3} \\approx 424554500$$\nExpressing this in scientific notation gives approximately $4.245545 \\times 10^8$.\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$R \\approx 4.25 \\times 10^8$$\nThis result signifies the profound inefficiency of paracrine signaling over large distances compared to contained synaptic signaling, requiring over $400$ million times more molecules to achieve the same peak concentration at the target. This highlights the evolutionary pressure for developing highly structured and confined signaling architectures like synapses for rapid and efficient long-distance communication between cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.25 \\times 10^8}$$", "id": "2645769"}]}
