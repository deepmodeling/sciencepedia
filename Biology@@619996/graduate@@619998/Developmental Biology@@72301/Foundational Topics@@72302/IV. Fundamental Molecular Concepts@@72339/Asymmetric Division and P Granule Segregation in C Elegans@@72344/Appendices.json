The analysis will be based on first principles of transport phenomena, specifically the comparison of characteristic timescales.\n\nFirst, we establish the characteristic timescales for the two transport processes over a given length scale $L$.\n\nThe characteristic time for diffusion, $\\tau_{d}$, is the typical time required for a particle to cover a distance $L$ via a random walk. This is derived from the scaling of the mean squared displacement with time for a diffusive process. For a characteristic distance $L$, we relate the length squared to the product of the diffusion coefficient $D$ and the characteristic time $\\tau_d$. The relationship is given by:\n$$\n\\tau_{d} = \\frac{L^{2}}{D}\n$$\nThis time represents how long it takes for diffusion to equilibrate or transport material over the length scale $L$.\n\nThe characteristic time for advection, $\\tau_{a}$, is the time required for a particle to be transported a distance $L$ by a bulk flow moving at a constant speed $v$. This is a deterministic process governed by the elementary relation between distance, speed, and time:\n$$\n\\tau_{a} = \\frac{L}{v}\n$$\nThis time represents how long it takes for advection to transport material over the same length scale $L$.\n\nThe problem asks for a single dimensionless number that quantifies the relative importance of advection to diffusion. If advection is the dominant mechanism for transport, the process of transport by flow occurs much more rapidly than the process of transport by diffusion. This physical condition translates to the advective timescale $\\tau_{a}$ being much smaller than the diffusive timescale $\\tau_{d}$, i.e., $\\tau_{a} \\ll \\tau_{d}$. To construct a dimensionless number where a large value signifies that advection is more important than diffusion, we must take the ratio of the timescales in a way that reflects this relationship. The appropriate ratio is $\\frac{\\tau_{d}}{\\tau_{a}}$.\n\nLet us define this dimensionless number, which is known as the Péclet number, $Pe$:\n$$\nPe = \\frac{\\tau_{d}}{\\tau_{a}} = \\frac{L^{2}/D}{L/v} = \\frac{Lv}{D}\n$$\nIf $Pe \\gg 1$, it implies that $\\tau_{d} \\gg \\tau_{a}$, indicating that advection is a much faster process and is thus the dominant transport mechanism over the length scale $L$. Conversely, if $Pe \\ll 1$, it implies that $\\tau_{d} \\ll \\tau_{a}$, indicating that diffusion dominates.\n\nNext, we must evaluate this dimensionless number using the provided parameters for the polarity factor in the *C. elegans* embryo:\n- Diffusion coefficient: $D = 0.1\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- Cortical flow speed: $v = 0.2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- Characteristic length scale (embryo half-length): $L = 25\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the Péclet number:\n$$\nPe = \\frac{Lv}{D} = \\frac{(25\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}) \\times (0.2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1})}{0.1\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}\n$$\nThe units are consistent and cancel out, yielding a dimensionless quantity:\n$$\nPe = \\frac{25 \\times 0.2}{0.1} = \\frac{5}{0.1} = 50\n$$\nThe calculated value is exactly $50$.\n\nFinally, we interpret this result. The problem asks to infer if symmetry breaking is flow-driven based on the condition that the dimensionless number is much greater than $1$. Our result is $Pe = 50$, which is indeed much greater than $1$.\nThis value of $Pe = 50$ implies that the timescale for advective transport ($\\tau_{a} = L/v = 25/0.2 = 125\\ \\mathrm{s}$) is $50$ times shorter than the timescale for diffusive transport ($\\tau_{d} = L^{2}/D = (25)^{2}/0.1 = 625/0.1 = 6250\\ \\mathrm{s}$).\nBiologically, this means that the cortical flow is substantially more effective at rearranging polarity factors over the scale of the embryo half-length than diffusion is. While diffusion may play a role in local homogenization, the large-scale segregation of factors such as PAR proteins is overwhelmingly driven by the advective cortical flow. Therefore, under these established parameters, the establishment of cortical asymmetry is unequivocally flow-driven. The final requested answer is only the numerical value of this dimensionless number.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{50}\n$$", "id": "2620662"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how flows can segregate components, we now examine the nature of P granules themselves as liquid-like biomolecular condensates.
