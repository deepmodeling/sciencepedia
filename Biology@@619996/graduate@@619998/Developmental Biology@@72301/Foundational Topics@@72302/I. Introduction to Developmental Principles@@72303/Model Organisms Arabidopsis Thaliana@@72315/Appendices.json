The entire process must be grounded in first principles.\n\nFirst, the problem will be validated.\n\nStep 1: Extract Givens\n- An accessible genomic target has a total length of $G$ base pairs.\n- A single T-DNA insertion occurs per line.\n- Insertions are independent events.\n- Insertions are uniformly distributed across the $G$ base pairs.\n- The target region for disrupting a specific gene has a length of $L$ base pairs.\n- A total of $N$ independent insertion lines are generated.\n- For part (3), the following values are provided: $G = 1.35 \\times 10^{8}$, $L = 2.00 \\times 10^{3}$, and $N = 5.00 \\times 10^{4}$.\n\nStep 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded. T-DNA insertional mutagenesis in *Arabidopsis thaliana* is a standard technique in plant genetics. The assumptions of uniform and independent insertions are common and valid for constructing a first-order mathematical model of the process. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters defined, and it asks for a derivable probabilistic expression, its limit, and a numerical value. The language is objective and precise. The problem is free of the invalidating flaws listed in the instructions; it is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, and non-trivial.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be constructed.\n\nPart 1: Exact Expression for the Probability of at Least One Disruption\n\nLet us model the genome as a discrete set of $G$ possible insertion sites, corresponding to the base pairs. The target region for disruption constitutes $L$ of these sites.\n\nThe assumption of a uniform distribution implies that the probability of a single insertion occurring at any specific site is $1/G$. The probability that a single T-DNA insertion event falls within the target region of length $L$ is the ratio of the number of target sites to the total number of accessible sites. Let this probability be denoted by $p$.\n\n$$p = \\frac{L}{G}$$\n\nThis is the probability of a \"hit,\" or success, for a single insertion line. Consequently, the probability that a single insertion does *not* fall within the target region (a \"miss\") is:\n\n$$1 - p = 1 - \\frac{L}{G}$$\n\nThe problem states that $N$ independent insertion lines are generated. The independence of the insertion events means that the probability of a sequence of events is the product of their individual probabilities. We are interested in the event $A$, where the gene is disrupted at least once. It is more direct to first calculate the probability of the complement event, $A^c$, which is that the gene is *not* disrupted in any of the $N$ lines. This corresponds to a sequence of $N$ independent misses.\n\nThe probability of $A^c$ is:\n$$P(A^c) = \\left(1 - \\frac{L}{G}\\right) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{L}{G}\\right) \\times \\dots \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{L}{G}\\right) \\quad (N \\text{ times})$$\n$$P(A^c) = \\left(1 - \\frac{L}{G}\\right)^{N}$$\n\nThe probability of event $A$ (at least one hit) is therefore $1 - P(A^c)$.\n\n$$P(A) = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{L}{G}\\right)^{N}$$\n\nThis is the exact expression for the probability of at least one disruption in $N$ lines, derived from first principles.\n\nPart 2: Limiting Approximation\n\nWe are asked to find an approximation in the regime where $L/G$ is small, $N$ is large, and the product $\\lambda = NL/G$ remains finite. This parameter $\\lambda$ represents the expected number of insertions within the gene of interest across the entire population of $N$ lines.\n\nWe must evaluate the limit of the expression for $P(A)$ under these conditions. Specifically, we examine the term $\\left(1 - L/G\\right)^{N}$ as $L/G \\to 0$ and $N \\to \\infty$ such that $NL/G = \\lambda$.\n\nFrom the definition of $\\lambda$, we can express $N$ as $N = \\lambda G/L$. Substituting this into the term gives:\n$$\\left(1 - \\frac{L}{G}\\right)^{N} = \\left(1 - \\frac{L}{G}\\right)^{\\frac{\\lambda G}{L}}$$\n\nTo evaluate the limit, let us introduce a variable $x = -L/G$. As $L/G \\to 0$, it follows that $x \\to 0$. The expression becomes:\n$$\\left(1 + x\\right)^{\\frac{-\\lambda}{x}} = \\left[\\left(1 + x\\right)^{\\frac{1}{x}}\\right]^{-\\lambda}$$\n\nWe use the fundamental limit that defines the mathematical constant $e$:\n$$\\lim_{x \\to 0} (1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}} = e$$\n\nApplying this limit to our expression, we find:\n$$\\lim_{L/G \\to 0} \\left(1 - \\frac{L}{G}\\right)^{N} = \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\left[\\left(1 + x\\right)^{\\frac{1}{x}}\\right]^{-\\lambda} = e^{-\\lambda}$$\n\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $P(A)$, we obtain the limiting closed-form approximation:\n$$P(A) \\approx 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{NL}{G}\\right)$$\n\nThis result is the probability of obtaining at least one event in a Poisson process with mean $\\lambda$. The approximation is valid under the following biological assumptions, which correspond to the mathematical conditions of the limit:\n1.  **Independence of Insertions**: The location of one T-DNA insertion does not influence the location of any other. This is stated in the problem and allows for the product of probabilities.\n2.  **Uniform Insertion Probability**: Each base pair in the accessible genome is an equally likely target for insertion. This justifies $p = L/G$ and is an idealization, as real T-DNA insertions exhibit some site preference (insertion hotspots).\n3.  **Small Target Size**: The gene's target region $L$ is minuscule compared to the genome $G$ ($L \\ll G$). This ensures the probability $p$ of a single hit is very small, which is a condition for the Poisson approximation to the binomial distribution.\n4.  **Large Population**: The number of independent lines $N$ is very large. This is the second condition for the Poisson approximation.\n5.  **Point-like Insertion Event**: The model treats each insertion as a point event, which is a valid simplification when the length of the T-DNA element itself is negligible compared to the target length $L$. A \"hit\" is defined as this point landing anywhere within the $L$ base-pair region.\n\nPart 3: Numerical Calculation\n\nWe use the approximation derived in Part 2 with the given values:\n- $G = 1.35 \\times 10^{8}$ bp\n- $L = 2.00 \\times 10^{3}$ bp\n- $N = 5.00 \\times 10^{4}$ lines\n\nFirst, we calculate the finite parameter $\\lambda$, the expected number of hits.\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{NL}{G} = \\frac{(5.00 \\times 10^{4}) \\times (2.00 \\times 10^{3})}{1.35 \\times 10^{8}}$$\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{10.00 \\times 10^{7}}{1.35 \\times 10^{8}} = \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{8}}{1.35 \\times 10^{8}} = \\frac{1.00}{1.35}$$\nTo express this as a simple fraction:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{1}{1.35} = \\frac{1}{135/100} = \\frac{100}{135} = \\frac{20}{27}$$\n\nNow, we compute the probability using the Poisson approximation:\n$$P(A) \\approx 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{20}{27}\\right)$$\n\nNumerically evaluating this expression:\n$$\\frac{20}{27} \\approx 0.74074074\\dots$$\n$$P(A) \\approx 1 - \\exp(-0.74074074\\dots)$$\n$$P(A) \\approx 1 - 0.476755\\dots$$\n$$P(A) \\approx 0.523244\\dots$$\n\nRounding the final numerical probability to four significant figures gives $0.5232$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5232}\n$$", "id": "2653435"}, {"introduction": "In contrast to the random approach of T-DNA mutagenesis, CRISPR-Cas9 technology offers precise, targeted gene disruption, forming the basis of modern reverse genetics.

It is deemed valid for proceeding to a solution.\n\n**Step 3: Solution Derivation**\nThe objective is to derive the function $F(p)$, which represents the expected fraction of biallelic knockout plants in the first transformed generation ($\\mathrm{T}1$). Based on principle (iii), this fraction $F(p)$ is equivalent to the probability of a single zygote resulting in a plant with a biallelic knockout genotype. We shall now derive this probability from first principles.\n\nA diploid organism possesses two alleles for a given gene locus. Let us denote these alleles as $A_1$ and $A_2$.\n\nAccording to principle (i), a biallelic knockout requires both alleles to be rendered nonfunctional. Let $E_1$ be the event that allele $A_1$ is successfully knocked out, and $E_2$ be the event that allele $A_2$ is successfully knocked out.\n\nThe problem defines $p$ as the per-allele probability of a knockout. As stated in principle (ii), the editing of an allele is a Bernoulli trial with success probability $p$. Therefore, the probabilities of the individual events $E_1$ and $E_2$ are:\n$$ P(E_1) = p $$\n$$ P(E_2) = p $$\n\nA biallelic knockout corresponds to the simultaneous occurrence of both events, $E_1$ and $E_2$. The probability of this compound event is the probability of the intersection of $E_1$ and $E_2$, denoted $P(E_1 \\cap E_2)$.\n\nPrinciple (ii) crucially states that the editing outcomes for the two alleles are independent events. For independent events, the probability of their intersection is the product of their individual probabilities.\n$$ P(E_1 \\cap E_2) = P(E_1) \\times P(E_2) $$\n\nSubstituting the defined probability $p$ for each event, we obtain the probability of a biallelic knockout for a single zygote:\n$$ P(\\text{biallelic knockout}) = p \\times p = p^{2} $$\n\nFinally, by applying principle (iii), the expected fraction of plants with the biallelic knockout genotype, $F(p)$, is equal to this calculated probability.\n$$ F(p) = P(\\text{biallelic knockout}) $$\n\nThus, the closed-form expression for the expected fraction of biallelic knockout plants is:\n$$ F(p) = p^{2} $$\nThis result is a direct consequence of the axioms provided in the problem statement and the fundamental multiplication rule for independent events in probability theory.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{p^{2}}$$", "id": "2653479"}, {"introduction": "Whether a transgenic line is generated by random T-DNA insertion or targeted CRISPR editing, a critical next step is to isolate a stable, homozygous line for reproducible downstream experiments.

Report this minimal integer $n$ as your final answer. No rounding by significant figures is required because $n$ is an integer.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard problem in Mendelian genetics and can be solved using fundamental principles of inheritance and probability theory. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the analysis of a monohybrid self-cross in *Arabidopsis thaliana* involving a dominant selectable marker. Let the allele for resistance be denoted by $A$ and the wild-type allele for sensitivity be denoted by $a$. The resistance phenotype is dominant, meaning genotypes $A/A$ and $A/a$ are resistant, while genotype $a/a$ is sensitive. The experiment involves self-pollinating a primary transformant ($T1$ generation) and analyzing the segregation of the resistance phenotype in its progeny (the $T2$ generation) on a selective medium.\n\nFirst, we must derive the expected segregation ratios for the two possible genotypes of the $T1$ parent.\n\nCase 1: The $T1$ parent is hemizygous ($A/a$).\nA self-cross of an $A/a$ individual is represented as $A/a \\times A/a$. According to Mendel's law of segregation, the parent produces two types of gametes, $A$ and $a$, in equal proportions ($1/2$ each). The genotypes of the $T2$ progeny are determined by the random fusion of these gametes, which can be visualized with a Punnett square:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n & \\boldsymbol{A} \\text{ (1/2)} & \\boldsymbol{a} \\text{ (1/2)} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\boldsymbol{A} \\text{ (1/2)} & A/A \\text{ (1/4)} & A/a \\text{ (1/4)} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{a} \\text{ (1/2)} & A/a \\text{ (1/4)} & a/a \\text{ (1/4)} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe expected genotypic ratio in the $T2$ generation is $1(A/A) : 2(A/a) : 1(a/a)$.\nGiven that allele $A$ is dominant, the corresponding phenotypic ratio can be determined.\n-   Resistant phenotype (survives on selective medium): Genotypes $A/A$ and $A/a$. The total proportion is $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n-   Sensitive phenotype (dies on selective medium): Genotype $a/a$. The proportion is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThus, for a hemizygous $T1$ parent, the expected phenotypic segregation ratio of resistant to sensitive seedlings in the $T2$ generation is $3:1$. When plated on selective medium, we expect $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the seedlings to survive.\n\nCase 2: The $T1$ parent is homozygous ($A/A$).\nA self-cross of an $A/A$ individual is represented as $A/A \\times A/A$. This parent can only produce one type of gamete, $A$. Consequently, all $T2$ progeny will have the genotype $A/A$. Since all progeny are homozygous dominant, all will express the resistant phenotype. The proportion of resistant seedlings is $1$, and the proportion of sensitive seedlings is $0$. The ratio of resistant to sensitive is $1:0$. All seedlings will survive on the selective medium.\n\nNext, we must propose a criterion to distinguish between a hemizygous and a homozygous $T1$ parent. Based on the analysis above, the presence of even a single sensitive ($a/a$) seedling in the $T2$ progeny definitively proves that the $T1$ parent must have carried the $a$ allele, i.e., it was hemizygous ($A/a$). Conversely, if all observed $T2$ seedlings are resistant, it supports the hypothesis that the $T1$ parent was homozygous ($A/A$). However, this observation does not constitute absolute proof, because it is possible by chance to sample only resistant progeny from a hemizygous parent. The criterion is therefore probabilistic: we plate $n$ seeds and if all $n$ survive, we infer the parent was homozygous. The confidence in this inference increases with $n$.\n\nThe final task is to calculate the minimum sample size, $n$, required to be reasonably confident in this inference. We are given the condition to declare the line homozygous if all $n$ seedlings survive. We must find the minimal integer $n$ such that the probability of making a false declaration (i.e., observing all $n$ survivors when the parent was in fact hemizygous) is less than or equal to a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\nLet $P(S)$ be the probability that a single randomly selected $T2$ seedling from a hemizygous ($A/a$) parent survives on the selective medium. As derived in Case 1, $P(S) = \\frac{3}{4}$. The seedlings are assumed to develop independently. The probability that all $n$ plated seedlings survive is the product of their individual probabilities of survival:\n$$ P(\\text{all } n \\text{ survive} | T1 \\text{ is } A/a) = (P(S))^n = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^n $$\nWe need to find the smallest integer $n$ that satisfies the inequality:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^n \\le 0.05 $$\nTo solve for $n$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^n\\right) \\le \\ln(0.05) $$\n$$ n \\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) \\le \\ln(0.05) $$\nThe term $\\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)$ is negative because its argument is less than $1$.
