It is scientifically grounded in the principles of developmental biology, specifically concerning the well-characterized model organism *Caenorhabditis elegans*.

We may proceed with the analysis.\n\nLet $N_{WT}$ denote the number of somatic cells in a wild-type adult hermaphrodite.\nLet $N_{PCD}$ denote the number of somatic cells that undergo programmed cell death (PCD) during wild-type development.\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following values:\n$$N_{WT} = 959$$\n$$N_{PCD} = 131$$\n\nThe total number of somatic cells generated during the developmental lineage, let us call it $N_{total}$, is the sum of the cells that survive to adulthood in the wild type and the cells that are eliminated by PCD.\n$$N_{total} = N_{WT} + N_{PCD}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$N_{total} = 959 + 131 = 1090$$\n\nThe problem describes a `ced-3` loss-of-function mutant, `ced-3(lf)`. In this mutant, all developmentally programmed cell deaths are suppressed. This means that the $N_{PCD}$ cells that would normally die will now survive. The somatic cell lineage is stated to be otherwise unchanged. Therefore, the total number of adult somatic cells in the mutant, which we denote as $N_{mutant}$, will be equal to the total number of cells generated during development.\n$$N_{mutant} = N_{total} = N_{WT} + N_{PCD}$$\n$$N_{mutant} = 1090$$\n\nWith this foundation, we address the two parts of the problem.\n\nPart 1: Compute the change in total adult somatic cell number in the `ced-3(lf)` mutant relative to wild type.\n\nThe change, denoted by $\\Delta N$, is the difference between the cell number in the mutant and the cell number in the wild type.\n$$\\Delta N = N_{mutant} - N_{WT}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $N_{mutant}$:\n$$\\Delta N = (N_{WT} + N_{PCD}) - N_{WT}$$\n$$\\Delta N = N_{PCD}$$\nThis result is logically necessary: the increase in cell number is precisely the number of cells that were saved from their programmed fate of death.\nUsing the given value for $N_{PCD}$:\n$$\\Delta N = 131$$\n\nPart 2: Compute the fraction of ectopic survivors expressed relative to the wild-type total somatic cell count.\n\nThe \"ectopic survivors\" are the cells that would have died in the wild type but survive in the `ced-3(lf)` mutant.

This requires checking for common divisors between the numerator, $131$, and the denominator, $959$. The number $131$ is a prime number. We must therefore only check if $959$ is divisible by $131$.\nPerforming the division:\n$$\\frac{959}{131} \\approx 7.32$$\nSince $131$ does not divide $959$ an integer number of times, the fraction $\\frac{131}{959}$ is irreducible and is in its simplest form.\n\nThe two requested values are the change in cell number, $131$, and the fraction of ectopic survivors, $\\frac{131}{959}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n131 & \\frac{131}{959}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2653638"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply counting cells, understanding development requires deciphering the genetic circuits that control the timing and sequence of events. The *C. elegans* heterochronic pathway, which ensures larval stages unfold correctly, is a canonical example of such a circuit. This problem challenges you to use genetic logic to predict the outcome of a double-mutant combination involving the key regulators `lin-4` and `lin-14` [@problem_id:1674149]. Mastering this type of epistatic analysis is fundamental to dissecting complex gene regulatory networks from experimental data.", "problem": "In the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans*, the timing of developmental events is controlled by a group of genes known as heterochronic genes. A key process governed by these genes is the division pattern of the lateral seam cells. In a wild-type (WT) animal, a single seam cell undergoes a specific sequence of divisions through the four larval stages (L1, L2, L3, L4).\n\nThe typical WT division pattern is as follows:\n-   **L1 stage:** The seam cell undergoes one symmetric division, producing two seam cells. This is an proliferative division that increases the seam cell pool.\n-   **L2, L3, and L4 stages:** The seam cell undergoes one asymmetric division at each stage. The anterior daughter cell differentiates and fuses with the main body syncytial hypodermis, while the posterior daughter remains a seam stem cell.\n-   **L4-to-adult transition:** The seam cell ceases to divide as a stem cell and undergoes a final symmetric division where both daughter cells terminally differentiate, secrete components of the adult cuticle called alae, and then exit the cell cycle.\n\nThis temporal transition is regulated by the `lin-14` and `lin-4` genes. The `lin-14` gene product is a protein that is normally present at high levels during the L1 stage, where it promotes the L1-specific symmetric division. For the worm to transition to L2 and later fates, `lin-14` protein levels must decrease. The `lin-4` gene does not code for a protein; instead, it produces a microRNA that negatively regulates `lin-14` by binding to its messenger RNA and repressing its translation. `lin-4` expression begins in the late L1 stage, triggering the downregulation of `lin-14`.\n\nConsider two types of mutations: a `lin-4` loss-of-function (`lf`) mutation, which results in a non-functional `lin-4` microRNA, and a `lin-14` loss-of-function (`lf`) mutation, which results in a non-functional `lin-14` protein.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements most accurately describes the terminal phenotype of the lateral seam cell lineage in a `lin-4(lf); lin-14(lf)` double mutant animal?\n\nA. The double mutant exhibits a precocious phenotype identical to that of a `lin-14(lf)` single mutant. The L1-specific symmetric division is skipped, leading to fewer seam cells and premature terminal differentiation.\n\nB. The double mutant exhibits a retarded phenotype identical to that of a `lin-4(lf)` single mutant. The L1-specific symmetric division is reiterated at later stages, leading to a vast excess of seam cells and a failure to terminally differentiate.\n\nC. The double mutant exhibits a wild-type phenotype, as the two loss-of-function mutations cancel each other out, restoring the normal timing of seam cell divisions.\n\nD. The double mutant has a novel synthetic phenotype, distinct from both single mutants, where seam cells might undergo an arrested development early in L1, leading to an extremely reduced number of cells.\n\nE. The double mutant is lethal and thus has no terminal phenotype, as the simultaneous loss of two key developmental timing genes leads to catastrophic systemic failure.", "solution": "We formalize the regulatory logic and its consequences for seam cell division patterns.\n\n1) Regulatory relationships and thresholds:\n- Let $L(t)$ denote the effective activity of the $lin\\mbox{-}14$ protein at developmental time $t$.\n- $lin\\mbox{-}4$ is a negative post-transcriptional regulator of $lin\\mbox{-}14$. Thus, when $lin\\mbox{-}4$ is functional and expressed, $L(t)$ decreases; when $lin\\mbox{-}4$ is absent, $L(t)$ remains high.\n- There exists a threshold $L^{\\ast}$ such that:\n  - If $L(t)>L^{\\ast}$, the seam cell executes the L1-specific symmetric, proliferative division.\n  - If $L(t)<L^{\\ast}$, the seam cell executes later-stage fates (L2–L4 asymmetric divisions and, at the appropriate transition, terminal differentiation).\n\n2) Wild-type temporal profile and seam cell counts:\n- In WT, $lin\\mbox{-}14$ is high early in L1 (before $lin\\mbox{-}4$ turns on), so $L(t)>L^{\\ast}$ in early L1, then $lin\\mbox{-}4$ expression begins in late L1, driving $L(t)<L^{\\ast}$ thereafter.\n- Let $S_{k}$ be the number of seam cells after stage $k$ (with $k=0$ pre-L1, $k=1$ post-L1, etc.). Then in WT:\n  $$S_{1}=2S_{0} \\quad\\text{(L1 symmetric division)}$$\n  $$S_{2}=S_{1},\\quad S_{3}=S_{2},\\quad S_{4}=S_{3} \\quad\\text{(L2–L4 asymmetric self-renewal)}$$\n  After L4-to-adult, cells terminally differentiate and stop dividing.\n\n3) Single-mutant predictions from the regulatory logic:\n- $lin\\mbox{-}4(lf)$: $lin\\mbox{-}4$ microRNA is absent, so there is no repression of $lin\\mbox{-}14$; thus $L(t)>L^{\\ast}$ persists across stages. Consequences:\n  - Seam cells reiterate L1-like symmetric divisions at later stages (retarded phenotype).\n  - Seam cell counts double at each stage:\n    $$S_{1}=2S_{0},\\quad S_{2}=2S_{1}=2^{2}S_{0},\\quad S_{3}=2S_{2}=2^{3}S_{0},\\ldots$$\n  - Terminal differentiation is delayed or fails at the normal time.\n- $lin\\mbox{-}14(lf)$: $lin\\mbox{-}14$ protein is non-functional, so $L(t)=0$ at all times, hence $L(t)<L^{\\ast}$ even in L1. Consequences:\n  - The L1-specific symmetric division is skipped; later fates are adopted precociously (precocious phenotype).\n  - Seam cell counts do not undergo the L1 doubling:\n    $$S_{1}=S_{0},\\quad S_{2}=S_{1},\\quad S_{3}=S_{2},\\quad S_{4}=S_{3}$$\n  - Terminal differentiation occurs earlier than in WT.\n\n4) Double-mutant epistasis logic:\n- In $lin\\mbox{-}4(lf); lin\\mbox{-}14(lf)$, $lin\\mbox{-}14$ protein is absent, so $L(t)=0$ regardless of $lin\\mbox{-}4$ status. Thus $L(t)<L^{\\ast}$ at all times.\n- Because $lin\\mbox{-}4$ acts upstream solely to reduce $lin\\mbox{-}14$ activity, loss of $lin\\mbox{-}14$ renders loss of $lin\\mbox{-}4$ ineffectual for this pathway. Therefore $lin\\mbox{-}14(lf)$ is epistatic to $lin\\mbox{-}4(lf)$.\n- Phenotypically, the double mutant must follow the $lin\\mbox{-}14(lf)$ precocious pattern: the L1 symmetric division is skipped, leading to fewer seam cells and premature terminal differentiation.\n\n5) Mapping to the options:\n- This corresponds exactly to option A. Options B, C, D, and E are inconsistent with the pathway logic and known epistasis: B contradicts downstream loss of $lin\\mbox{-}14$, C is incompatible with loss-of-function in both genes, D adds unsupported synthetic effects, and E conflicts with the viability typically observed for these heterochronic mutants.\n\nTherefore, the terminal phenotype of the lateral seam cell lineage in the $lin\\mbox{-}4(lf); lin\\mbox{-}14(lf)$ double mutant matches the precocious phenotype of the $lin\\mbox{-}14(lf)$ single mutant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1674149"}, {"introduction": "Qualitative predictions from genetic diagrams are powerful, but modern developmental biology increasingly relies on quantitative and predictive models.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular biology and chemical kinetics, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient information, and uses objective, formal language. The model is a standard, albeit simplified, representation of microRNA-mediated gene regulation, a topic of central importance in developmental biology and systems biology. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe task is to derive the steady-state protein level, $P_{\\mathrm{ss}}$, of the transcription factor `lin-14` as a function of its regulatory parameters. This derivation is predicated on the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, modeled using deterministic chemical kinetics.\n\n**1. Derivation of Steady-State mRNA Level ($M_{\\mathrm{ss}}$)**\n\nThe concentration of `lin-14` messenger RNA, denoted by $M$, changes over time as a function of its synthesis (transcription) and degradation. The ordinary differential equation (ODE) describing this process is:\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = \\text{rate of synthesis} - \\text{rate of degradation}\n$$\nAccording to the problem statement, transcription occurs at a constant rate $k_m$ (molecules per cell per hour), and mRNA degradation is a first-order process with rate constant $d_m$ (per hour). The problem specifies that the microRNA `lin-4` does not affect mRNA stability, only its translation. Thus, the ODE for $M$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = k_m - d_m M\n$$\nAt steady state, the concentration of mRNA does not change, which implies $\\frac{dM}{dt} = 0$. We solve for the steady-state mRNA level, $M_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$\n0 = k_m - d_m M_{\\mathrm{ss}}\n$$\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{k_m}{d_m}\n$$\nThe steady-state mRNA level is determined by the ratio of the transcription rate to the mRNA degradation rate constant.\n\n**2. Derivation of Steady-State Protein Level ($P_{\\mathrm{ss}}$)**\n\nThe concentration of `lin-14` protein, denoted by $P$, is governed by its synthesis (translation from mRNA) and its first-order degradation with rate constant $d_p$. The corresponding ODE is:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = \\text{rate of synthesis} - \\text{rate of degradation}\n$$\nThe rate of degradation is $d_p P$. The rate of synthesis depends on the concentration of translationally active mRNA.\n\nThe problem defines that only `lin-14` mRNA molecules with all of their `lin-4` binding sites unbound are active for translation. Let $R$ be the abundance of `lin-4` microRNA, and $K$ be the dissociation constant for the `lin-4`-mRNA binding interaction. For a single binding site, the probability of it being unbound is given by the fraction $\\frac{K}{K+R}$. Assuming the $n$ binding sites on the mRNA are independent and identical, the probability that all $n$ sites are simultaneously unbound is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$\np_{\\text{active}} = \\left(\\frac{K}{K+R}\\right)^n\n$$\nThe concentration of translationally active mRNA is the total mRNA concentration, $M$, multiplied by this probability, $M \\cdot p_{\\text{active}}$.\n\nProtein synthesis occurs from this pool of active mRNA with a translation rate constant $k_t$ (proteins per mRNA per hour). The total protein synthesis rate is therefore $k_t \\cdot (M \\cdot p_{\\text{active}})$. The ODE for the protein level $P$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = k_t M \\left(\\frac{K}{K+R}\\right)^n - d_p P\n$$\nAt steady state, $\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0$, and the mRNA concentration is at its own steady state, $M = M_{\\mathrm{ss}}$.\n$$\n0 = k_t M_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\left(\\frac{K}{K+R}\\right)^n - d_p P_{\\mathrm{ss}}\n$$\nSolving for the steady-state protein level, $P_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{k_t M_{\\mathrm{ss}}}{d_p} \\left(\\frac{K}{K+R}\\right)^n\n$$\nSubstituting the previously derived expression for $M_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{k_m}{d_m}$:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{ss}}(k_m, d_m, k_t, d_p, K, n, R) = \\frac{k_t k_m}{d_p d_m} \\left(\\frac{K}{K+R}\\right)^n\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the steady-state `lin-14` protein level. It correctly shows that $P_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ is proportional to the rates of transcription and translation, inversely proportional to the rates of mRNA and protein degradation, and is repressed by the `lin-4` microRNA ($R$) in a manner dependent on the number of binding sites ($n$) and the binding affinity ($K$).\n\n**3. Implementation for Numerical Evaluation**\n\nThe derived formula for $P_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ is implemented in a program. For each test case, the parameters $(k_m, d_m, k_t, d_p, K, n, R, P_{\\mathrm{crit}})$ are used to compute $P_{\\mathrm{ss}}$. A special case to consider is $n=0$, where the repression term evaluates to $(\\cdot)^0 = 1$, correctly indicating no repression. The calculated $P_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ is then compared to the threshold $P_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. The L1-to-L2 transition is permitted if and only if $P_{\\mathrm{ss}} < P_{\\mathrm{crit}}$.
