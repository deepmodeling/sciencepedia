A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe objective is to find the smallest integer cleavage cycle number, denoted $c^{\\ast}$, at which the concentration of free histone octamers, $H_{\\mathrm{free}}(c)$, falls below a specified threshold, $H_{\\mathrm{thr}}$. The condition is given by the inequality:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{free}}(c) \\leq H_{\\mathrm{thr}}$$\n\nThe pool of free histones at cycle $c$, $H_{\\mathrm{free}}(c)$, is the total initial pool, $H_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, minus the amount bound to the newly synthesized DNA, $H_{\\mathrm{bound}}(c)$:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{free}}(c) = H_{\\mathrm{tot}} - H_{\\mathrm{bound}}(c)$$\n\nWe must first derive an expression for $H_{\\mathrm{bound}}(c)$.

It presents a standard transport phenomena problem in the context of developmental biology, based on the established advection-diffusion equation and the Péclet number. All necessary parameters and functional dependencies are provided. Thus, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe transport of the morphogen is governed by two processes: advection with velocity $U$ and diffusion with diffusivity $D$. The relative importance of these processes over a length scale $L$ is quantified by the Péclet number, $Pe$. The Péclet number is the ratio of the characteristic time for diffusion, $t_{diff} = L^2/D$, to the characteristic time for advection, $t_{adv} = L/U$.\n$$Pe = \\frac{t_{diff}}{t_{adv}} = \\frac{L^2/D}{L/U} = \\frac{UL}{D}$$\nWe are given the functional form of the velocity $U$ as a function of the embryo size $L$:\n$$U(L) = U_{0}\\left(\\frac{L}{L_{0}}\\right)^{1/2}$$\nwhere $U_{0} = 0.06$ $\\mathrm{\\mu m/s}$, $L_{0} = 500$ $\\mathrm{\\mu m}$, and the diffusivity is a constant $D = 10$ $\\mathrm{\\mu m^{2}/s}$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $U(L)$ into the definition of the Péclet number gives its dependence on the embryo size $L$:\n$$Pe(L) = \\frac{U(L)L}{D} = \\frac{U_{0}\\left(\\frac{L}{L_{0}}\\right)^{1/2}L}{D} = \\frac{U_{0}}{D L_{0}^{1/2}} L^{3/2}$$\n\n1) The condition under which advection dominates diffusion is when the advective transport is much faster than diffusive transport over the length of the system. This corresponds to $Pe \\gg 1$. Conversely, diffusion dominates when $Pe \\ll 1$. The threshold embryo size $L^{\\ast}$ at which the two contributions are comparable is found by setting the Péclet number to unity:\n$$Pe(L^{\\ast}) = 1$$\n$$\\frac{U_{0}}{D L_{0}^{1/2}} (L^{\\ast})^{3/2} = 1$$\nSolving for $L^{\\ast}$:\n$$(L^{\\ast})^{3/2} = \\frac{D L_{0}^{1/2}}{U_{0}}$$\n$$L^{\\ast} = \\left(\\frac{D L_{0}^{1/2}}{U_{0}}\\right)^{2/3}$$\nFor embryo sizes $L \\gg L^{\\ast}$, advection will dominate.

The entire system is governed by diffusion. In a system defined by a length $L$ and a diffusivity $D$, with no other intrinsic length or time scales, any characteristic length that arises from the process, such as the pattern length $\\ell$, must be proportional to the system size $L$.

The total reorientation rate is $1/\\tau_p$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_p} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_0} + \\lambda\n$$\nThis gives the effective persistence time modified by CIL:\n$$\n\\tau_p = \\frac{1}{1/\\tau_0 + \\lambda} = \\frac{\\tau_0}{1 + \\lambda\\tau_0}\n$$\nNow, we must solve the double integral:\n$$\nI = \\int_0^t dt' \\int_0^t dt'' e^{-|t'-t''|/\\tau_p}\n$$\nWe can split the domain of integration into two symmetric regions, $t' > t''$ and $t'' > t'$, and multiply the result of one by $2$:\n$$\nI = 2 \\int_0^t dt' \\int_0^{t'} dt'' e^{-(t'-t'')/\\tau_p}\n$$\nFirst, evaluate the inner integral with respect to $t''$:\n$$\n\\int_0^{t'} e^{-(t'-t'')/\\tau_p} dt'' = e^{-t'/\\tau_p} \\int_0^{t'} e^{t''/\\tau_p} dt'' = e^{-t'/\\tau_p} \\left[ \\tau_p e^{t''/\\tau_p} \\right]_0^{t'} = e^{-t'/\\tau_p} (\\tau_p e^{t'/\\tau_p} - \\tau_p) = \\tau_p(1 - e^{-t'/\\tau_p})\n$$\nNext, substitute this into the outer integral with respect to $t'$:\n$$\nI = 2 \\int_0^t \\tau_p(1 - e^{-t'/\\tau_p}) dt' = 2\\tau_p \\left[ t' + \\tau_p e^{-t'/\\tau_p} \\right]_0^t\n$$\nEvaluating the integral at the limits:\n$$\nI = 2\\tau_p \\left( (t + \\tau_p e^{-t/\\tau_p}) - (0 + \\tau_p e^0) \\right) = 2\\tau_p (t + \\tau_p e^{-t/\\tau_p} - \\tau_p)\n$$\nFactoring out $\\tau_p$:\n$$\nI = 2\\tau_p^2 \\left( \\frac{t}{\\tau_p} - 1 + e^{-t/\\tau_p} \\right)\n$$\nThe MSD of the persistent random walk component is $\\mathrm{MSD}_{\\text{PRW}}(t) = v^2 I$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}_{\\text{PRW}}(t) = 2 v^2 \\tau_p^2 \\left( \\frac{t}{\\tau_p} - 1 + e^{-t/\\tau_p} \\right)\n$$\nCombining this with the drift component, we arrive at the final expression for the total MSD:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(t) = 2 v^2 \\tau_p^2 \\left( \\frac{t}{\\tau_p} - 1 + e^{-t/\\tau_p} \\right) + b^2 t^2\n$$\nThis formula is valid for all $t \\ge 0$. As a check, for short times ($t \\ll \\tau_p$), the Taylor expansion of the exponential term yields $\\mathrm{MSD}(t) \\approx v^2 t^2 + b^2 t^2$, which is the ballistic regime. For long times ($t \\gg \\tau_p$), it yields $\\mathrm{MSD}(t) \\approx 2v^2\\tau_p t + b^2 t^2$, corresponding to a diffusive process with drift. At $t=0$, $\\mathrm{MSD}(0)=0$ as expected.\n\nThe final algorithm is:\n$1$. Given parameters $v$, $\\tau_0$, $\\lambda$, $b$, and $t$.\n$2$. Handle the trivial case $t=0$, where $\\mathrm{MSD}(0)=0$.\n$3$. Calculate the effective persistence time $\\tau_p = \\tau_0 / (1 + \\lambda\\tau_0)$.\n$4$. Calculate the total MSD using the derived formula: $\\mathrm{MSD}(t) = 2 v^2 \\tau_p^2 \\left( \\frac{t}{\\tau_p} - 1 + e^{-t/\\tau_p} \\right) + b^2 t^2$.\nThis provides a complete, quantitative model based on the specified primitives.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the Mean Squared Displacement (MSD) of a biased persistent random walk\n    based on a derived closed-form expression.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Test suite parameter sets from the problem statement.\n    # Each tuple is (v, tau_0, lambda, b, t) with units\n    # (micrometer/second, second, per second, micrometer/second, second).\n    test_cases = [\n        (0.5, 600, 0.001, 0.20, 1800),    # Case A (general)\n        (0.4, 300, 0.0, 0.0, 1200),       # Case B (no chemotactic drift)\n        (0.6, 15, 0.05, 0.10, 600),       # Case C (strong CIL, short persistence)\n        (0.3, 10000, 0.0, 0.05, 300),     # Case D (near-ballistic window)\n        (0.8, 200, 0.02, 0.10, 0)         # Case E (boundary at zero time)\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        v, tau0, lam, b, t = case\n\n        # For t=0, displacement is zero, so MSD is zero.\n        if t == 0:\n            results.append(0.0)\n            continue\n            \n        # 1.
