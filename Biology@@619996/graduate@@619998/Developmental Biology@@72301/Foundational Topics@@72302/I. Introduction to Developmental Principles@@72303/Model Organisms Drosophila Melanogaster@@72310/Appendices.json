It is scientifically grounded in the context of developmental biology, specifically the study of *Drosophila melanogaster*. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient, consistent, and objective information to derive a unique solution based on established geometric and physical principles. The model of a spherical embryo cortex with a uniform hexagonal packing of nuclei is a standard and appropriate idealization for this type of analysis. We shall now proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the nearest-neighbor spacing, $s$, between cortical nuclei, which are assumed to be uniformly distributed in a hexagonal packing on the surface of a sphere.\n\nLet $C$ be the equatorial circumference of the spherical embryo model, and let $N$ be the total number of cortical nuclei. The given values are $C = 1.6~\\text{mm}$ and $N = 6,000$.\n\nFirst, we determine the surface area of the spherical cortex, denoted by $A$. The circumference of a great circle of a sphere with radius $R$ is given by:\n$$C = 2 \\pi R$$\nFrom this, we can express the radius $R$ in terms of the circumference $C$:\n$$R = \\frac{C}{2 \\pi}$$\nThe surface area $A$ of a sphere is given by the formula $A = 4 \\pi R^2$.

With $N$ nuclei uniformly distributed over the area $A$, the density is:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{N}{A} = \\frac{N}{C^2/\\pi} = \\frac{N \\pi}{C^2}$$\nNext, we relate this macroscopic density to the microscopic arrangement of the nuclei. The problem states that the nuclei are locally arranged in a near-hexagonal packing. In an ideal two-dimensional hexagonal lattice, the nearest-neighbor spacing is $s$. The area associated with each lattice point can be calculated by considering the primitive unit cell. The primitive unit cell of a hexagonal lattice is a rhombus composed of two equilateral triangles with side length $s$. The area of one such equilateral triangle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2$. The area of the rhombus, which contains one nucleus in total (by summing the fractional contributions from its vertices, or by considering one point at its center), is twice this value.\n$$A_{\\text{cell}} = 2 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s^2$$\nThe areal number density $\\sigma$ is the reciprocal of the area per nucleus, $A_{\\text{cell}}$:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{1}{A_{\\text{cell}}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s^2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3} s^2}$$\nWe now have two independent expressions for the areal density $\\sigma$. By equating them, we can solve for the spacing $s$:\n$$\\frac{N \\pi}{C^2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3} s^2}$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for $s^2$:\n$$s^2 = \\frac{2 C^2}{\\sqrt{3} N \\pi}$$\nTaking the square root gives the final analytical expression for the nearest-neighbor spacing $s$ in terms of $N$ and $C$:\n$$s = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 C^2}{\\sqrt{3} N \\pi}} = C \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3} N \\pi}}$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we must evaluate $s$ numerically.

Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Residual Sum of Squares (RSS)**\nUnder the assumption of Gaussian errors, maximizing the log-likelihood is equivalent to minimizing the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) via Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).\n\n- For the null model, the OLS estimate for $\\mu$ is the sample mean $\\hat{\\mu} = \\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i$. The RSS under the null model is:\n$$ \\text{RSS}_0 = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\bar{y})^2 $$\n\n- For the alternative model, we perform a simple linear regression of $\\mathbf{y}$ on $\\mathbf{g}_m$. The RSS under the alternative model is:\n$$ \\text{RSS}_1(m) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - (\\hat{\\mu}' + \\hat{\\beta} g_{im}))^2 $$\nwhere $\\hat{\\mu}'$ and $\\hat{\\beta}$ are the OLS estimates. OLS guarantees that $\\text{RSS}_1(m) \\le \\text{RSS}_0$.\n\n**3. Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT)**\nThe LRT statistic compares the goodness-of-fit of the two nested models. For large samples, it is given by:\n$$ \\text{LRT}(m) = n \\left( \\ln(\\text{RSS}_0) - \\ln(\\text{RSS}_1(m)) \\right) = n \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\text{RSS}_0}{\\text{RSS}_1(m)}\\right) $$\nUnder the null hypothesis (i.e., $\\beta = 0$), the LRT statistic asymptotically follows a chi-square ($\\chi^2$) distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of parameters between the two models. Here, the alternative model has one additional parameter ($\\beta$), so $\\text{LRT}(m) \\sim \\chi^2_1$.\n\nThe problem mentions the LOD score, which is related to the LRT statistic by a simple scaling factor:\n$$ \\text{LOD}(m) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{L}_A}{\\mathcal{L}_0}\\right) = \\frac{\\ln(\\mathcal{L}_A/\\mathcal{L}_0)}{\\ln(10)} = \\frac{\\text{LRT}(m)}{2 \\ln(10)} $$\nWhile the LOD score is a common metric in genetics, the p-value calculation relies directly on the LRT statistic and its reference $\\chi^2$ distribution.\n\n**4. P-value Calculation**\nFor each marker $m$, the p-value is the probability of observing an LRT statistic as extreme as or more extreme than the one calculated, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n$$ p_m = P(\\chi^2_1 \\ge \\text{LRT}(m)) $$\nThis is calculated using the survival function ($1 - \\text{CDF}$) of the $\\chi^2_1$ distribution.\n\n**5. Monomorphic Markers**\nIf a marker's genotype vector $\\mathbf{g}_m$ has zero variance (i.e., all individuals have the same genotype), it is monomorphic. In the alternative model, the genotype column becomes a multiple of the intercept column, causing perfect collinearity. The model is not identifiable and provides no additional information over the null model. Consequently, $\\text{RSS}_1(m) = \\text{RSS}_0$, leading to $\\text{LRT}(m) = n \\ln(1) = 0$. This corresponds to a p-value of $p_m = P(\\chi^2_1 \\ge 0) = 1$. As specified, such markers are non-informative and cannot be significant.\n\n**6. Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) Procedure**\nTo control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) at level $\\alpha$ when performing $M$ tests, we apply the BH procedure:\n1.  Collect the $p$-values for all $M$ markers: $\\{p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_M\\}$.\n2.  Sort the p-values in ascending order: $p_{(1)} \\le p_{(2)} \\le \\dots \\le p_{(M)}$. Let the original marker index corresponding to $p_{(i)}$ be $m_{(i)}$.\n3.  Find the largest integer $k$ such that:\n$$ p_{(k)} \\le \\frac{k}{M} \\alpha $$\n4.  If such a $k$ exists, reject the null hypotheses for all markers corresponding to the p-values $p_{(1)}, \\dots, p_{(k)}$. These are the significant markers.\n5.  If no such $k$ exists, no markers are deemed significant.\n\nThis procedure will be applied to each test case to determine the final set of significant QTLs.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import chi2\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the QTL mapping problem for the given test cases.\n    For each case, it identifies significant markers using a Likelihood Ratio Test\n    and Benjamini-Hochberg FDR control.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A\n        (\n            np.array([10.1, 12.3, 9.8, 12.1, 10.5, 12.4, 10.2, 11.9, 9.7, 12.2, 10.0, 12.5]),\n            np.array([\n                [0, 0, 1, 0],\n                [1, 0, 0, 1],\n                [0, 1, 0, 1],\n                [1, 1, 0, 0],\n                [0, 0, 1, 0],\n                [1, 0, 1, 1],\n                [0, 1, 0, 1],\n                [1, 1, 0, 0],\n                [0, 0, 1, 0],\n                [1, 1, 0, 1],\n                [0, 1, 0, 1],\n                [1, 1, 0, 0]\n            ]),\n            0.05\n        ),\n        # Case B\n        (\n            np.array([5.0, 5.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.0, 4.9, 5.3, 5.1, 4.7, 5.0]),\n            np.array([\n                [0, 1, 0],\n                [0, 1, 1],\n                [0, 1, 0],\n                [0, 1, 1],\n                [0, 1, 0],\n                [0, 1, 1],\n                [0, 1, 0],\n                [0, 1, 1],\n                [0, 1, 0],\n                [0, 1, 1]\n            ]),\n            0.05\n        ),\n        # Case C\n        (\n            np.array([7.0, 7.1, 6.9, 7.2, 10.1, 10.0, 10.2, 9.9]),\n            np.array([\n                [0, 0, 0],\n                [0, 0, 1],\n                [0, 0, 1],\n                [0, 0, 0],\n                [1, 1, 0],\n                [1, 1, 1],\n                [1, 1, 1],\n                [1, 1, 0]\n            ]),\n            0.05\n        )\n    ]\n    \n    # Correction of the genotype matrix for Case A to match problem description\n    G_A_correct = np.array([\n        [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],\n        [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n        [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n    ]).T\n    test_cases[0] = (test_cases[0][0], G_A_correct, test_cases[0][2])\n\n\n    results = []\n    for y, G, alpha in test_cases:\n        n = len(y)\n        M = G.shape[1]\n        p_values = []\n\n        # Calculate RSS for the null model (H0: y = mu + e)\n        y_mean = np.mean(y)\n        rss0 = np.sum((y - y_mean)**2)\n\n        for m in range(M):\n            g = G[:, m]\n            \n            # For monomorphic markers, genotype variance is 0.\n            if np.var(g) == 0:\n                p_values.append((1.0, m))\n                continue\n\n            # Fit alternative model (HA: y = mu' + beta*g + e') using OLS\n            X = np.vstack([np.ones(n), g]).T\n            _, rss1_array, _, _ = np.linalg.lstsq(X, y, rcond=None)\n            \n            if rss1_array.size == 0 or rss1_array[0]  1e-12:\n                p = 0.0\n            else:\n                rss1 = rss1_array[0]\n                if rss1 >= rss0:\n                    lrt = 0.0\n                else:\n                    lrt = n * np.log(rss0 / rss1)\n                \n                p = chi2.sf(lrt, df=1)\n            \n            p_values.append((p, m))\n\n        # Benjamini-Hochberg procedure\n        p_values.sort()\n\n        significant_indices = []\n        k_max = 0\n        \n        for i in range(M - 1, -1, -1):\n            p, _ = p_values[i]\n            rank = i + 1\n            if p = (rank / M) * alpha:\n                k_max = rank\n                break\n        \n        if k_max > 0:\n            for i in range(k_max):\n                significant_indices.append(p_values[i][1])\n        \n        significant_indices.sort()\n        results.append(significant_indices)\n\n    print(str(results).replace(\" \", \"\"))\n```", "id": "2654708"}]}
