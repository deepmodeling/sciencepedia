Consider the following widely used, mass-balance titration model of histone availability: the total free histone pool is given by $H_{\\mathrm{free}} = H_0 - \\alpha N \\cdot \\mathrm{DNA}$, where $H_0$ is the maternally supplied histone amount (assumed constant prior to MBT), $\\alpha$ is the effective histone stoichiometry per unit DNA packaged into chromatin, $N$ is the number of nuclei, and $\\mathrm{DNA}$ is the DNA content per nucleus measured in haploid units. The MBT occurs when $H_{\\mathrm{free}}$ falls to an empirically determined critical threshold $H_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, which is assumed to be the same across ploidy conditions.

This model posits that the massive replication of DNA in the early, non-growing embryo titrates away maternally supplied factors, such as histones or other repressors, that keep the zygotic genome silent.\n\n1.  **Scientific Grounding**: The model is a cornerstone concept in developmental biology, particularly for understanding the MBT in organisms like *Xenopus* and *Drosophila*. It is not speculative and does not violate fundamental principles.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem asks for a relative comparison of the number of cleavage cycles, which suggests that absolute values of parameters might cancel out.

The statement that $H_0$, $\\alpha$, and $H_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ are constants is crucial and makes the problem solvable.\n5.  **Feasibility**: The model is a simplification, but the conditions described (rapid cleavage, maternal supply, dependence on DNA content) are biologically realistic for early embryonic development.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem that can be solved using the provided information. We now proceed to the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Derivation\nThe timing of the MBT is defined by the condition $H_{\\mathrm{free}} = H_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. Substituting the given model for $H_{\\mathrm{free}}$:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{crit}} = H_0 - \\alpha N_{\\mathrm{MBT}} \\cdot \\mathrm{DNA}$$\nHere, $N_{\\mathrm{MBT}}$ is the number of nuclei at the onset of the MBT. We can rearrange this equation to solve for the product of the number of nuclei and the DNA content per nucleus at the MBT:\n$$\\alpha N_{\\mathrm{MBT}} \\cdot \\mathrm{DNA} = H_0 - H_{\\mathrm{crit}}$$\n$$N_{\\mathrm{MBT}} \\cdot \\mathrm{DNA} = \\frac{H_0 - H_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{\\alpha}$$\nThe parameters $H_0$, $H_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, and $\\alpha$ are stated to be constants. Therefore, the right side of the equation is a constant value. Let us define this constant as $K$:\n$$K = \\frac{H_0 - H_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{\\alpha}$$\nThe condition for the MBT can thus be written as:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{MBT}} \\cdot \\mathrm{DNA} = K$$\nThe number of nuclei, $N$, doubles with each cleavage cycle. If we assume the embryo starts as a single cell (zygote) at cycle $c=0$, then after $c$ cycles, the number of nuclei is $N(c) = 2^c$.\n\nLet us apply this framework to the two cases: haploid and diploid embryos.\n\n**Case 1: Haploid Embryo**\nFor the haploid embryo, the DNA content per nucleus is $\\mathrm{DNA}_{h} = 1$. Let $c_{h}$ be the number of cleavage cycles required to reach the MBT. At this point, the number of nuclei is $N_{\\mathrm{MBT},h} = 2^{c_h}$.\nSubstituting these into our condition for MBT:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{MBT},h} \\cdot \\mathrm{DNA}_{h} = K$$\n$$2^{c_h} \\cdot 1 = K$$\n$$2^{c_h} = K$$\n\n**Case 2: Diploid Embryo**\nFor the diploid embryo, the DNA content per nucleus is $\\mathrm{DNA}_{d} = 2$. Let $c_{d}$ be the number of cleavage cycles required to reach the MBT. The number of nuclei is $N_{\\mathrm{MBT},d} = 2^{c_d}$.\nSubstituting these into the condition for MBT:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{MBT},d} \\cdot \\mathrm{DNA}_{d} = K$$\n$$2^{c_d} \\cdot 2 = K$$\n$$2^{c_d + 1} = K$$\n\n**Comparison**\nWe now have two expressions for the constant $K$. By equating them, we can find the relationship between $c_{h}$ and $c_{d}$:\n$$2^{c_h} = 2^{c_d + 1}$$\nFor the equality to hold, the exponents must be equal:\n$$c_h = c_d + 1$$\nRearranging this equation to express $c_d$ in terms of $c_h$:\n$$c_d = c_h - 1$$\nThis result demonstrates that the number of cleavage cycles required for a diploid embryo to reach the MBT is one less than the number required for a haploid embryo. In other words, the MBT occurs one cycle earlier in the diploid embryo. The total amount of DNA in the embryo, which is the product $N \\cdot \\mathrm{DNA}$, reaches the critical value $K$ one cycle sooner in the diploid case because the per-nucleus DNA content is twice as large.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Exactly $1$ cleavage cycle earlier in diploid than haploid**\nOur derivation yielded the result $c_d = c_h - 1$, which means the MBT in the diploid embryo occurs at a cycle number that is one less than in the haploid embryo. This corresponds to the MBT occurring one cycle earlier.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. No change; the MBT occurs at the same cleavage cycle in diploid and haploid**\nThis would imply $c_d = c_h$. This is incorrect. The model explicitly ties the trigger to the total amount of DNA in the embryo ($N \\cdot \\mathrm{DNA}$). Since the diploid embryo has twice the DNA per nucleus, it accumulates total DNA faster than the haploid embryo.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Exactly $2$ cleavage cycles earlier in diploid than haploid**\nThis would imply $c_d = c_h - 2$. This would require the diploid condition to provide a factor of $2^2 = 4$ acceleration, for example, if the DNA content were $4$ times higher. The problem states the diploid DNA content is $2$ times higher, leading to an acceleration factor of $2$, which corresponds to $1$ cycle.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Exactly $1$ cleavage cycle later in diploid than haploid**\nThis would imply $c_d = c_h + 1$. This is the mathematical inverse of the correct result and would imply that having more DNA per nucleus delays the MBT, which contradicts the histone titration model.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. It cannot be determined without the numerical values of $H_0$, $\\alpha$, and $H_{\\mathrm{crit}}$**\nThis is false. The derivation shows that the relative timing of the MBT between the two conditions depends only on the ratio of their DNA content. The absolute values of the constants $H_0$, $\\alpha$, and $H_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ are consolidated into a term $K$ that is eliminated when comparing the two scenarios.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2650468"}, {"introduction": "Building on the fundamental principles of the titration model, this practice challenges you to think like an experimentalist.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. I will now proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nLet us denote the parameters for the control (uninjected) embryo with a subscript $c$, and for the injected embryo with a subscript $i$.\n\n**Control Embryo:**\nThe total histone pool is $H_c$.\nThe total DNA at cycle $n$ is $D_n$. Since the DNA content doubles at each cycle, if $D_0$ is the DNA content of the single-cell zygote, then $D_n = 2^n D_0$.\nThe free histone pool at cycle $n$ is $H_{\\mathrm{free}, c}(n) = H_c - \\alpha D_n$.\nZGA is triggered at the first integer cycle $N_c$ where the free histone level drops to or below the threshold $H^\\ast$:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{free}, c}(N_c) = H_c - \\alpha D_{N_c} \\le H^\\ast$$\nApproximating the onset as the point where the available titratable histone pool ($H_c - H^\\ast$) is depleted by the accumulated DNA, we can write:\n$$\\alpha D_{N_c} \\approx H_c - H^\\ast$$\n$$\\alpha (2^{N_c} D_0) \\approx H_c - H^\\ast \\quad (1)$$\n\n**Injected Embryo:**\nThe total histone pool is increased by $25\\%$:\n$$H_i = H_c + 0.25 H_c = 1.25 H_c$$\nThe ZGA condition is applied with this new histone pool, occurring at cycle $N_i$:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{free}, i}(N_i) = H_i - \\alpha D_{N_i} \\le H^\\ast$$\nUsing the same approximation as for the control:\n$$\\alpha D_{N_i} \\approx H_i - H^\\ast$$\n$$\\alpha (2^{N_i} D_0) \\approx 1.25 H_c - H^\\ast \\quad (2)$$\n\n**Calculating the Delay:**\nTo find the delay, $\\Delta N = N_i - N_c$, we can divide equation $(2)$ by equation $(1)$:\n$$\\frac{\\alpha (2^{N_i} D_0)}{\\alpha (2^{N_c} D_0)} \\approx \\frac{1.25 H_c - H^\\ast}{H_c - H^\\ast}$$\n$$2^{N_i - N_c} \\approx \\frac{1.25 H_c - H^\\ast}{H_c - H^\\ast}$$\n$$2^{\\Delta N} \\approx 1 + \\frac{0.25 H_c}{H_c - H^\\ast}$$\nThe result depends on the ratio of the threshold histone level $H^\\ast$ to the total histone pool $H_c$. The titration model is most effective and robust as a biological switch if the titratable component ($H_c - H^\\ast$) constitutes a substantial fraction of the total pool, which implies that the threshold $H^\\ast$ is small relative to $H_c$. The most straightforward and standard simplifying assumption for such a model is to consider an ideal switch, where $H^\\ast \\ll H_c$, or approximately $H^\\ast \\approx 0$.\n\nUnder this assumption, the equation becomes:\n$$2^{\\Delta N} \\approx 1 + \\frac{0.25 H_c}{H_c} = 1.25$$\nWe solve for the theoretical delay $\\Delta N$:\n$$\\Delta N \\approx \\log_2(1.25) = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right) = \\log_2(5) - \\log_2(4) \\approx 2.3219 - 2 = 0.3219$$\nSo, the theoretical delay is approximately $0.32$ cycles.\n\n**Interpreting the Result:**\nThe problem explicitly states that \"ZGA onset is operationally scored at discrete completed cycles.\" This is a critical instruction. A theoretical delay of $0.32$ cycles means that at the time the control embryo begins ZGA (at the end of cycle $N_c$), the injected embryo has not yet reached its ZGA threshold. The threshold for the injected embryo will be crossed during the next cycle, $N_c+1$. Therefore, when assayed at the end of discrete cycles, ZGA in the injected embryo will not be detected at cycle $N_c$ but will be detected at cycle $N_c+1$.\n- Control ZGA onset: Cycle $N_c$.\n- Injected ZGA onset: Cycle $N_c+1$.\nThe observed delay in whole cleavage cycles is therefore:\n$$(N_c+1) - N_c = 1$$\nThis is true for any theoretical delay $\\Delta N$ such that $0 < \\Delta N \\le 1$. Our calculated value $\\Delta N \\approx 0.32$ falls squarely in this range.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. About $0$ additional cycles (no delay)**\nA delay of $0$ cycles is incorrect. Injecting a transcriptional repressor (histone) must delay the process of derepression (ZGA). Our calculation shows a non-zero theoretical delay ($\\Delta N > 0$), which means the observed delay must be at least one full cycle. **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. About $0.5$ of a cycle**\nThis value is numerically close to our calculated theoretical delay of $\\approx 0.32$ cycles. However, the problem requires the answer to be in whole cleavage cycles based on how ZGA is scored. An answer of half a cycle is inconsistent with this constraint. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. About $1$ full cleavage cycle**\nThis aligns perfectly with our analysis. A theoretical delay of $\\approx 0.32$ cycles means the event is missed at the original checkpoint (cycle $N_c$) and is only observed at the next one (cycle $N_c+1$), corresponding to an observed delay of $1$ full cycle. **Correct**.\n\n**D. About $2$ full cleavage cycles**\nAn observed delay of $2$ cycles would require a theoretical delay $1 < \\Delta N \\le 2$. This would imply $2 < 2^{\\Delta N} \\le 4$, which in turn requires $0.75 H_c < H^\\ast \\le 0.917 H_c$. This represents a system where the threshold for repression is extremely high, making the timer sensitive and less robust. While mathematically possible, the prediction of a $1$-cycle delay is more general and robust, holding for any $0 \\le H^\\ast \\le 0.75 H_c$. Therefore, a $1$-cycle delay is the \"best prediction.\" **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2650439"}, {"introduction": "While the principles of ZGA timing are conserved, their implementation varies widely across the animal kingdom, reflecting diverse evolutionary pressures on life history.

Use the following fundamental base and definitions.\n\nFundamental base:\n- The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology states that DNA is transcribed into RNA and translated into protein. During early embryogenesis, transcription from the zygotic genome is globally repressed until a titration-like threshold involving DNA and chromatin regulators is crossed, initiating zygotic genome activation.\n- In eukaryotic chromatin, DNA is packaged by nucleosomes, each nucleosome containing one histone octamer. A well-tested packing density is approximately one nucleosome per $200$ base pairs. Thus, the stoichiometric requirement of histone octamers per base pair is $\\rho = 1/200$.\n- Early cleavage cycles increase the total DNA content by increasing the number of nuclei. If $n_c$ denotes the number of nuclei after $c$ cleavage cycles and $G$ denotes the haploid genome size in base pairs, then total DNA base pairs scale as $n_c \\cdot G$.\n\nModeling assumptions to be used:\n- Let $H_0$ denote the maternal histone stockpile measured in histone octamer equivalents.

Therefore, we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute a sensitivity score, $S$, for a set of species, which quantifies their vulnerability to perturbations in the maternal histone supply. This score is based on a titration model where zygotic genome activation is triggered when the concentration of free histones falls below a universal threshold. We will rank the species in descending order of this sensitivity score.\n\nLet us first formalize the model. The state of the system is evaluated at a reference cleavage cycle, $c_{\\mathrm{ref}}$.

The effective histone stockpile is $H_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\beta \\cdot H_0$.\n\nThe pool of free, unbound histone octamers, $F$, is the difference between the effective supply and the amount bound to DNA:\n$$F = H_{\\mathrm{eff}} - D = \\beta \\cdot H_0 - \\rho \\cdot n_{c_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\cdot G$$\nThe model posits that zygotic genome activation is related to the concentration of these free histones per base pair, denoted by $h$:\n$$h = \\frac{F}{D_{\\text{DNA}}} = \\frac{\\beta \\cdot H_0 - \\rho \\cdot n_{c_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\cdot G}{n_{c_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\cdot G} = \\frac{\\beta \\cdot H_0}{n_{c_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\cdot G} - \\rho$$\nActivation is triggered when $h$ drops to the threshold $\\theta$.\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the sensitivity of this system to a reduction in $H_0$. We define $q$ as the minimal fractional reduction in $H_0$ that causes the system to exactly meet the threshold condition, $h = \\theta$. Let the perturbed histone stockpile be $H'_0 = (1-q)H_0$. The new free histone concentration, $h'$, is:\n$$h' = \\frac{\\beta \\cdot (1-q)H_0}{n_{c_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\cdot G} - \\rho$$\nWe set $h' = \\theta$ and solve for $q$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{\\beta \\cdot (1-q)H_0}{n_{c_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\cdot G} - \\rho$$\n$$\\theta + \\rho = \\frac{\\beta \\cdot (1-q)H_0}{n_{c_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\cdot G}$$\n$$1 - q = \\frac{(\\theta + \\rho) \\cdot n_{c_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\cdot G}{\\beta \\cdot H_0}$$\n$$q = 1 - \\frac{(\\theta + \\rho) \\cdot n_{c_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\cdot G}{\\beta \\cdot H_0}$$\nThe problem specifies that if the unperturbed system already satisfies $h \\le \\theta$, then $q$ should be $0$. The condition $h \\le \\theta$ implies $\\frac{\\beta \\cdot H_0}{n_{c_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\cdot G} - \\rho \\le \\theta$, which rearranges to $1 \\le \\frac{(\\theta + \\rho) \\cdot n_{c_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\cdot G}{\\beta \\cdot H_0}$. Substituting this into our expression for $q$ yields $q \\le 0$. Since $q$ represents a fractional reduction, it must be non-negative, $q \\in [0,1]$. Thus, the correct procedure is to calculate the value from the formula and take $q = \\max(0, q_{\\text{calculated}})$.\n\nFinally, the sensitivity score $S$ is defined as $S = 1 / (q + \\varepsilon)$. The regularizer $\\varepsilon$ prevents division by zero when $q=0$ and ensures that species for which $q=0$ (i.e., those already at or below the threshold) are assigned a large, finite sensitivity score. A smaller $q$ indicates that only a small perturbation is needed to trigger ZGA, signifying higher sensitivity and resulting in a larger $S$.\n\nThe computational steps for each species with parameters $(G, H_0, \\gamma, \\beta)$ are:\n1.  Calculate the number of nuclei at the reference cycle: $n_{c_{\\mathrm{ref}}} = 2^{\\gamma \\cdot c_{\\mathrm{ref}}}$.\n2.  Calculate the theoretical fractional reduction: $q_{\\text{calc}} = 1 - \\frac{(\\theta + \\rho) \\cdot n_{c_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\cdot G}{\\beta \\cdot H_0}$.\n3.  Apply the boundary condition: $q = \\max(0, q_{\\text{calc}})$.\n4.  Compute the sensitivity score: $S = 1 / (q + \\varepsilon)$.\n\nAfter computing $S$ for all species, they are ranked in descending order of $S$. Ties are broken by ascending species index. The final output will be the list of species indices in this ranked order.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Ranks species by their predicted sensitivity to perturbations in maternal\n    histone supply during the maternal-to-zygotic transition, using a\n    principled titration model.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the constants from the problem statement.\n    RHO = 1.0 / 200.0  # Nucleosome packing density (octamers/bp)\n    C_REF = 10.0       # Reference cleavage cycle\n    THETA = 1.0e-3     # Activation threshold (free histone octamers/bp)\n    EPSILON = 1.0e-4   # Regularizer for sensitivity score\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each species is a tuple: (G, H0, gamma, beta)\n    # G: haploid genome size (bp)\n    # H0: maternal histone stockpile (octamer equivalents)\n    # gamma: cleavage geometry exponent\n    # beta: histone partitioning efficiency\n    test_cases = [\n        (1.5e9, 9.0e9, 0.95, 0.85),  # Species 1\n        (3.0e9, 2.5e10, 0.90, 0.90), # Species 2\n        (1.8e8, 1.0e9, 1.05, 0.80),  # Species 3\n        (2.7e9, 1.5e10, 0.85, 0.95), # Species 4\n        (8.0e8, 6.0e9, 1.00, 0.88),  # Species 5\n    ]\n\n    species_scores = []\n    for i, case in enumerate(test_cases):\n        G, H0, gamma, beta = case\n        species_index = i + 1\n\n        # Step 1: Compute n_c_ref\n        n_c_ref = 2**(gamma * C_REF)\n\n        # Step 2: Compute H_eff\n        H_eff = beta * H0\n        \n        # Step 3 and 4: Determine the minimal fractional reduction q\n        # The derivation for q is: q = 1 - ( (theta + rho) * n_c_ref * G ) / H_eff\n        # where H_eff = beta * H0\n        \n        # Check if any denominator is zero to avoid runtime errors, though not expected from problem values\n        if H_eff == 0:\n            # If there's no histone stockpile, any amount of DNA will not be packaged.\n            # This is a pathological case.
