Its initial DNA mass, before the first cleavage cycle, is twice the haploid mass:\n$$ M_{\\text{zygote}} = 2m_{h} $$\nEarly cleavage cycles are synchronous divisions. Before each division, the entire genome is replicated. After $n$ completed cycles, the single-celled zygote has developed into an embryo containing $2^n$ cells. Each of these cells is diploid, containing a DNA mass of $2m_{h}$.\nTherefore, the total DNA mass in the embryo after $n$ cycles is the number of cells multiplied by the DNA mass per cell:\n$$ M(n) = (\\text{number of cells}) \\times (\\text{diploid DNA mass}) = 2^n \\times (2m_{h}) = 2^{n+1}m_{h} $$\nThe cytoplasmic volume, $V$, is assumed to remain constant throughout these early cycles.

I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\nThe core principle is that for the entire genome to be replicated within the time $T_S$, every point on the DNA must be traversed by a replication fork by or before time $T_S$. We seek the minimal density of origins, $\\rho_{\\min}$, that satisfies this condition. A minimal density corresponds to the maximum possible spacing between adjacent origins.\n\nLet us consider a segment of the linear genome. Assume origins are activated at positions along the DNA. Let the distance between two adjacent origins be $L$. Per assumption (iv), these two origins fire simultaneously at time $t=0$.\n\nFrom the origin at position $x_i$, one fork moves to the right and one to the left. From the adjacent origin at position $x_{i+1} = x_i + L$, one fork moves to the left and one to the right. The segment of DNA between these two origins, of length $L$, will be replicated by the fork moving right from $x_i$ and the fork moving left from $x_{i+1}$.\n\nThese two forks move toward each other, each with a speed $v$. The point on the DNA that will be replicated last is the midpoint between these two origins, located at a distance of $\\frac{L}{2}$ from each.\n\nThe time, $t_{\\text{rep}}$, required for a fork to travel from an origin to this midpoint is given by the relation between distance, speed, and time:\n$$t_{\\text{rep}} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{L/2}{v} = \\frac{L}{2v}$$\nFor the replication of the segment to be complete, this time must be less than or equal to the duration of the S phase, $T_S$.\n$$\\frac{L}{2v} \\le T_S$$\nWe are interested in the minimal density of origins, $\\rho_{\\min}$. The density of origins, $\\rho$, is the number of origins per unit length. If origins are spaced a distance $L$ apart, the density is given by $\\rho = \\frac{1}{L}$. To minimize the density $\\rho$, we must maximize the spacing $L$.\n\nLet $L_{\\max}$ be the maximum permissible distance between origins. This maximum spacing is determined by the limit where the replication time equals the S phase duration:\n$$\\frac{L_{\\max}}{2v} = T_S$$\nSolving for $L_{\\max}$:\n$$L_{\\max} = 2 v T_S$$\nThis expression gives the maximum inter-origin distance that guarantees complete replication within time $T_S$.\n\nThe minimal density, $\\rho_{\\min}$, corresponds to this maximum spacing, $L_{\\max}$. By substituting $L_{\\max}$ into the density relation $\\rho = \\frac{1}{L}$:\n$$\\rho_{\\min} = \\frac{1}{L_{\\max}}$$\nTherefore, the minimal required origin density is:\n$$\\rho_{\\min} = \\frac{1}{2 v T_S}$$\nThis result is independent of the total genome size $G$, which is consistent with the problem asking for a density and instructing that edge effects be neglected.
