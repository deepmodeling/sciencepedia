The second part requires the calculation of the fold-change, $F$, in protein kinase A (PKA) activity.\n\nPart 1: Calculation of $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$\n\nThe intracellular pH is governed by the carbon dioxide-bicarbonate buffer system, described by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n$$ \\mathrm{pH} = pK_{a} + \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}]} \\right) $$\nThe concentration of carbonic acid, $[\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}]$, is in equilibrium with dissolved aqueous carbon dioxide, $[\\mathrm{CO}_{2}]_{\\mathrm{aq}}$. According to Henry's Law, the concentration of dissolved gas is proportional to its partial pressure, $p\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Therefore, $[\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}]$ is proportional to $p\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. The problem states that $p\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is held constant.
