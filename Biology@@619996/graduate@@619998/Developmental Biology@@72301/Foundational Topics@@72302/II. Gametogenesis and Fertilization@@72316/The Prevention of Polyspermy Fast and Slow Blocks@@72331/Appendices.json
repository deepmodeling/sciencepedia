It is therefore valid.\n\nWe proceed with the solution, which consists of two tasks.\n\nFirst, we compute the total amount of protease, in moles, released into the perivitelline space upon cortical granule exocytosis.\nThe given data are:\nNumber of cortical granules per egg, $N_{CG} = 1.5 \\times 10^{4}$.\nProtease content per granule, $n_{CG} = 0.1 \\, \\text{fmol} = 0.1 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{mol}$.\n\nThe total number of moles of protease, $N_{total}$, is the product of the number of granules and the moles per granule:\n$$N_{total} = N_{CG} \\times n_{CG}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$N_{total} = (1.5 \\times 10^{4}) \\times (0.1 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{mol}) = 1.5 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\text{mol}$$\n\nSecond, we derive a dimensionless group that compares the rate of surface reaction to the rate of diffusive supply and compute its value.

Let $C_0$ be the characteristic concentration of protease at the source of diffusion (the egg plasma membrane at $x=0$).\n\nThe characteristic rate of diffusive supply, $J_{diff, char}$, is the maximum possible flux across the layer of thickness $L$. This maximum flux occurs under the steepest possible concentration gradient, which happens when the reaction is infinitely fast, consuming all protease upon arrival, such that $C(L)=0$.

The problem states that this rate is given by $\\lambda = \\kappa \\rho$, where $\\rho$ is the sperm density and $\\kappa$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nA first fusion is defined to occur at time $T_1$. Due to the memoryless property of the Poisson process, the process of subsequent arrivals after $T_1$ is statistically identical to the original process. We can, without loss of generality, shift the time origin to $T_1$, so we are interested in events in the interval $(0, W]$, where $W$ is the duration of the \"open window\" for polyspermy.\n\nThe open window for additional fusions is given as the interval $(T_1, T_1 + \\min(L_f, T_s))$, where $L_f$ is the random latency for the fast block to initiate, and $T_s$ is the deterministic time for the slow block to complete.
