Consider an oocyte whose plasma membrane carries a uniform receptor density $R$ (number of receptors per unit membrane area). The extracellular vitellogenin concentration is $V$. Binding between receptor and vitellogenin is assumed to be rapid relative to internalization and recycling, such that receptor occupancy is at quasi-equilibrium governed by the Law of Mass Action with an equilibrium dissociation constant $K_{D}$ (in the same concentration units as $V$). Each occupied receptor is internalized at a rate constant $k_{\\text{int}}$ (per second), and receptors rapidly recycle so that the total receptor density $R$ remains constant in time.

It does not violate any of the validation criteria. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**, and I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Uptake Flux, $J(V)$\nThe total density of receptors, $R$, is the sum of the density of free receptors, $R_{free}$, and the density of occupied receptors (receptor-vitellogenin complexes), $R_{occ}$.\n$$R = R_{free} + R_{occ}$$\nThe reversible binding of vitellogenin ($V$) to a free receptor ($R_{free}$) to form an occupied receptor ($R_{occ}$) is described by the reaction:\n$$R_{free} + V \\rightleftharpoons R_{occ}$$\nThe equilibrium for this reaction is governed by the dissociation constant $K_{D}$, which is defined by the Law of Mass Action. For binding of a ligand from a bulk solution to a surface receptor, $K_{D}$ is defined as the bulk concentration at which half of the receptors are occupied. The relationship is:\n$$K_{D} = \\frac{[R_{free}] [V]}{[R_{occ}]}$$\nAlthough $R_{free}$ and $R_{occ}$ are surface densities and $V$ is a volume concentration, this formulation leads to the standard Langmuir isotherm for fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, where $\\theta = \\frac{R_{occ}}{R}$. We can substitute $R_{free} = R - R_{occ}$ into the expression for $K_{D}$:\n$$K_{D} = \\frac{(R - R_{occ}) V}{R_{occ}} = \\left(\\frac{R}{R_{occ}} - 1\\right)V$$\nRecognizing that $R/R_{occ} = 1/\\theta$, we have:\n$$K_{D} = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\theta} - 1\\right)V$$\nSolving for the fractional occupancy $\\theta$:\n$$\\frac{K_{D}}{V} = \\frac{1}{\\theta} - 1 \\implies \\frac{1}{\\theta} = 1 + \\frac{K_{D}}{V} = \\frac{V + K_{D}}{V}$$\n$$\\theta = \\frac{V}{K_{D} + V}$$\nThe density of occupied receptors is therefore:\n$$R_{occ} = R \\cdot \\theta = R \\frac{V}{K_{D} + V}$$\nThe uptake flux, $J(V)$, is the rate of internalization of vitellogenin molecules per unit area. Since each occupied receptor is internalized with a first-order rate constant $k_{\\text{int}}$ and there is one vitellogenin molecule per receptor, the flux is given by the product of $k_{\\text{int}}$ and the density of occupied receptors $R_{occ}$.\n$$J(V) = k_{\\text{int}} \\cdot R_{occ}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $R_{occ}$, we arrive at the final expression for the vitellogenin uptake flux:\n$$J(V) = k_{\\text{int}} R \\frac{V}{K_{D} + V}$$\n\n### Numerical Calculations\nWe are given the following values:\n$R = 500\\ \\text{receptors}\\ \\mu\\text{m}^{-2}$\n$K_{D} = 0.20\\ \\mu\\text{g}\\ \\text{mL}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\text{int}} = 0.05\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n\n1) **Uptake flux $J$ at $V = 0.80\\ \\mu\\text{g}\\ \\text{mL}^{-1}$**\nWe use the derived expression for $J(V)$. The problem states one vitellogenin molecule is internalized per receptor, so the flux in `receptors` $\\mu\\text{m}^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$ is numerically identical to the flux in `molecules` $\\mu\\text{m}^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n$$J = (0.05\\ \\text{s}^{-1}) (500\\ \\text{molecules}\\ \\mu\\text{m}^{-2}) \\frac{0.80\\ \\mu\\text{g}\\ \\text{mL}^{-1}}{0.20\\ \\mu\\text{g}\\ \\text{mL}^{-1} + 0.80\\ \\mu\\text{g}\\ \\text{mL}^{-1}}$$\nThe concentration units in the fraction cancel out:\n$$J = (25\\ \\text{molecules}\\ \\mu\\text{m}^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}) \\frac{0.80}{1.00}$$\n$$J = 25 \\times 0.80\\ \\text{molecules}\\ \\mu\\text{m}^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1} = 20\\ \\text{molecules}\\ \\mu\\text{m}^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $20.0\\ \\text{molecules}\\ \\mu\\text{m}^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n\n2) **Saturation value of the uptake flux, $J_{sat}$**\nThe saturation flux is the limit of $J(V)$ as the vitellogenin concentration $V$ approaches infinity. At infinitely high concentration, all receptors become occupied.\n$$J_{sat} = \\lim_{V \\to \\infty} J(V) = \\lim_{V \\to \\infty} \\left( k_{\\text{int}} R \\frac{V}{K_{D} + V} \\right)$$\nWe can divide the numerator and denominator of the fraction by $V$:\n$$J_{sat} = k_{\\text{int}} R \\lim_{V \\to \\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{D}}{V} + 1} \\right)$$\nAs $V \\to \\infty$, the term $K_{D}/V \\to 0$. Therefore, the limit of the fraction is $1$.\nThe maximum flux is:\n$$J_{sat} = k_{\\text{int}} R$$\nThis result is logical: the maximum rate of uptake is achieved when all available receptors ($R$) are being internalized at their maximal rate ($k_{\\text{int}}$).\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$J_{sat} = (0.05\\ \\text{s}^{-1}) (500\\ \\text{molecules}\\ \\mu\\text{m}^{-2})$$\n$$J_{sat} = 25\\ \\text{molecules}\\ \\mu\\text{m}^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $25.0\\ \\text{molecules}\\ \\mu\\text{m}^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n\nThe two requested values are $20.0\\ \\text{molecules}\\ \\mu\\text{m}^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$ and $25.0\\ \\text{molecules}\\ \\mu\\text{m}^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 20.0 & 25.0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2658851"}, {"introduction": "Oocyte maturation is held in check by inhibitory signals from surrounding somatic cells, ensuring it only proceeds at the correct time.

Thus, we have:\n$$f = \\frac{\\frac{q}{k_c}}{\\frac{q}{k_c} + \\frac{1-q}{k_s}}$$\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we find a common denominator for the terms in the main denominator, which is $k_c k_s$:\n$$f = \\frac{\\frac{q}{k_c}}{\\frac{q k_s + (1-q) k_c}{k_c k_s}}$$\nMultiplying the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator:\n$$f = \\frac{q}{k_c} \\cdot \\frac{k_c k_s}{q k_s + (1-q) k_c}$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{q k_s}{q k_s + (1-q) k_c}$$\nThis is the solution to Part $1$. The error rate $f$ is independent of the overall attachment rate $k_a$, as it only depends on the relative stabilities of the correct ($C$) and erroneous ($W$) states and the intrinsic bias ($q$) in their formation.\n\nPart 2: We must predict the aneuploidy probability if the error-correction rate $k_c$ is halved. Let the new rate be $k'_c = \\frac{k_c}{2}$.\nThe new error rate, let us call it $f'$, is found by substituting $k'_c$ for $k_c$ in the expression for $f$:\n$$f' = \\frac{q k_s}{q k_s + (1-q) k'_c} = \\frac{q k_s}{q k_s + (1-q) \\frac{k_c}{2}}$$\nThe aneuploidy probability for an oocyte with $M$ independent kinetochores is given as the probability that at least one kinetochore is erroneously attached, which is $1 - (1-f')^M$.\nWe substitute the expression for $f'$:\n$$P_{aneuploidy} = 1 - \\left( 1 - \\frac{q k_s}{q k_s + (1-q) \\frac{k_c}{2}} \\right)^M$$\nFirst, we simplify the term inside the parentheses:\n$$1 - \\frac{q k_s}{q k_s + (1-q) \\frac{k_c}{2}} = \\frac{(q k_s + (1-q) \\frac{k_c}{2}) - q k_s}{q k_s + (1-q) \\frac{k_c}{2}} = \\frac{(1-q) \\frac{k_c}{2}}{q k_s + (1-q) \\frac{k_c}{2}}$$\nTo clear the fraction in the denominator of this term, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by $2$:\n$$\\frac{2 \\cdot (1-q) \\frac{k_c}{2}}{2 \\cdot (q k_s + (1-q) \\frac{k_c}{2})} = \\frac{(1-q) k_c}{2 q k_s + (1-q) k_c}$$\nSubstituting this simplified term back into the aneuploidy probability expression gives the final result for Part $2$:\n$$P_{aneuploidy} = 1 - \\left( \\frac{(1-q) k_c}{2 q k_s + (1-q) k_c} \\right)^M$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{q k_s}{q k_s + (1-q) k_c} & 1 - \\left(\\frac{(1-q) k_c}{2 q k_s + (1-q) k_c}\\right)^M \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2658820"}]}
