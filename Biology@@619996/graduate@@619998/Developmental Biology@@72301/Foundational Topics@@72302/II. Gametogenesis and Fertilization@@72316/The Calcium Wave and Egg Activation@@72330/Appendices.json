Consider a minimal mechanistic representation that captures two robust, widely observed features of egg calcium oscillations:\n\n(i) Between spikes, Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase (SERCA) pumps refill the endoplasmic reticulum store at an approximately constant rate, denoted by $v_{\\mathrm{SERCA}}$, so that the store content increases linearly with time over the interspike interval. At each spike, inositol trisphosphate receptors ($\\mathrm{IP}_3\\mathrm{R}$) discharge a fraction of the store, producing a cytosolic calcium transient whose peak amplitude $A$ is proportional to the released store content. Let the proportionality constant be $g>0$, so the release per spike $\\Delta S$ and amplitude satisfy $A = g \\, \\Delta S$.\n\n(ii) The trigger for a spike is the accumulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ($\\mathrm{IP}_3$) to a threshold value $I_{\\mathrm{th}}$ that activates the $\\mathrm{IP}_3\\mathrm{R}$. Between spikes, the $\\mathrm{IP}_3$ concentration $I(t)$ rises approximately linearly at a rate governed by phospholipase C (PLC) activity, $k_{\\mathrm{prod}}$, starting from a post-spike baseline $I_0$. The refractory decay of $I(t)$ during the spike is fast compared to the interspike interval, so that $I(t)$ effectively resets to $I_0$ immediately after a spike.\n\nAssume steady, strictly periodic oscillations so that the depletion of the store at each spike equals the refilling that occurred in the preceding interspike interval. Assume that $I_{\\mathrm{th}}$, $I_0$, and $g$ are unchanged by the perturbation below, and that store leak is negligible on the interspike timescale.\n\nFrom these bases, derive expressions for the oscillation period $T$ and the amplitude $A$ in terms of $k_{\\mathrm{prod}}$, $v_{\\mathrm{SERCA}}$, and constants.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. We will proceed with the analysis.\n\nFirst, we must derive the theoretical expressions for the oscillation period, $T$, and the peak amplitude, $A$, from the provided model description.\n\nThe interspike interval, which defines the period $T$, is determined by the time required for the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ($\\mathrm{IP}_3$) concentration, $I(t)$, to rise from its post-spike baseline, $I_0$, to the activation threshold of the $\\mathrm{IP}_3$ receptors, $I_{\\mathrm{th}}$. The problem states that this increase is linear with a rate of production $k_{\\mathrm{prod}}$. We can thus write:\n$$I(t) = I_0 + k_{\\mathrm{prod}} \\cdot t$$\nA spike occurs at time $t=T$ when $I(T) = I_{\\mathrm{th}}$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{th}} = I_0 + k_{\\mathrm{prod}} \\cdot T$$\nSolving for the period $T$, we obtain:\n$$T = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{th}} - I_0}{k_{\\mathrm{prod}}}$$\nSince $I_{\\mathrm{th}}$ and $I_0$ are constants, we can define a constant $\\Delta I = I_{\\mathrm{th}} - I_0$. The expression for the period is then:\n$$T = \\frac{\\Delta I}{k_{\\mathrm{prod}}}$$\nThis shows that the period $T$ is inversely proportional to the rate of $\\mathrm{IP}_3$ production, $k_{\\mathrm{prod}}$.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the amplitude $A$. The Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase (SERCA) pump refills the calcium store at a constant rate $v_{\\mathrm{SERCA}}$ during the interspike interval $T$. The total amount of calcium refilled is therefore the product of the rate and the duration, $v_{\\mathrm{SERCA}} \\cdot T$. For steady, periodic oscillations, the amount of calcium released from the store at each spike, $\\Delta S$, must equal the amount refilled in the preceding interval.\n$$\\Delta S = v_{\\mathrm{SERCA}} \\cdot T$$\nThe problem states that the peak amplitude of the cytosolic calcium transient, $A$, is directly proportional to this released amount, with a proportionality constant $g > 0$.\n$$A = g \\cdot \\Delta S$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta S$, we get:\n$$A = g \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{SERCA}} \\cdot T$$\nWe can further substitute our derived expression for $T$ into this equation to relate $A$ to the elementary parameters $k_{\\mathrm{prod}}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{SERCA}}$:\n$$A = g \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{SERCA}} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{th}} - I_0}{k_{\\mathrm{prod}}} \\right)$$\nThis can be simplified by grouping all the constant terms ($g$, $I_{\\mathrm{th}}$, $I_0$) into a single constant, $C = g(I_{\\mathrm{th}}-I_0)$.\n$$A = C \\cdot \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{SERCA}}}{k_{\\mathrm{prod}}}$$\nThis shows that the amplitude $A$ is proportional to the ratio of the SERCA pump rate to the $\\mathrm{IP}_3$ production rate.\n\nNow, we apply these theoretical relationships to the experimental data. Let the \"before\" state be denoted by subscript $1$ and the \"after\" state by subscript $2$.\n\nFrom the experimental data before the drug is applied (state $1$):\nNumber of spikes is $8$ in a $20$-minute interval.\nThe period is $T_1 = \\frac{20 \\ \\mathrm{min}}{8} = 2.5 \\ \\mathrm{min}$.\nThe mean peak amplitude is $A_1 = 0.45 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu M}$.\n\nAfter the drug is applied (state $2$):\nNumber of spikes is $6$ in a $20$-minute interval.\nThe period is $T_2 = \\frac{20 \\ \\mathrm{min}}{6} = \\frac{10}{3} \\ \\mathrm{min}$.\nThe mean peak amplitude is $A_2 = 0.60 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu M}$.\n\nThe problem states that the drug targets only one parameter: either $k_{\\mathrm{prod}}$ or $v_{\\mathrm{SERCA}}$. We test the two resulting hypotheses.\n\nHypothesis 1: The drug targets the PLC pathway, so $k_{\\mathrm{prod}}$ changes ($k_{\\mathrm{prod,1}} \\neq k_{\\mathrm{prod,2}}$) while $v_{\\mathrm{SERCA}}$ remains constant ($v_{\\mathrm{SERCA,1}} = v_{\\mathrm{SERCA,2}} = v_{\\mathrm{SERCA}}$).\nFrom our derived equations, we form ratios between the two states:\nThe ratio of periods is $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{\\Delta I / k_{\\mathrm{prod,2}}}{\\Delta I / k_{\\mathrm{prod,1}}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{prod,1}}}{k_{\\mathrm{prod,2}}}$.\nThe ratio of amplitudes is $\\frac{A_2}{A_1} = \\frac{C \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{SERCA}} / k_{\\mathrm{prod,2}}}{C \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{SERCA}} / k_{\\mathrm{prod,1}}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{prod,1}}}{k_{\\mathrm{prod,2}}}$.\nThis hypothesis predicts that the ratio of periods must be equal to the ratio of amplitudes: $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{A_2}{A_1}$.\nLet us check this with the experimental values:\nRatio of periods: $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{10/3}{2.5} = \\frac{10/3}{5/2} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 2}{3 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{20}{15} = \\frac{4}{3}$.\nRatio of amplitudes: $\\frac{A_2}{A_1} = \\frac{0.60}{0.45} = \\frac{60}{45} = \\frac{4}{3}$.\nThe experimentally observed ratios are identical, which is consistent with Hypothesis 1.\n\nHypothesis 2: The drug targets the SERCA pathway, so $v_{\\mathrm{SERCA}}$ changes ($v_{\\mathrm{SERCA,1}} \\neq v_{\\mathrm{SERCA,2}}$) while $k_{\\mathrm{prod}}$ remains constant ($k_{\\mathrm{prod,1}} = k_{\\mathrm{prod,2}} = k_{\\mathrm{prod}}$).\nThe period is given by $T = \\frac{\\Delta I}{k_{\\mathrm{prod}}}$. If $k_{\\mathrm{prod}}$ is constant, the period must also be constant, i.e., $T_1 = T_2$.\nHowever, our experimental data shows $T_1 = 2.5 \\ \\mathrm{min}$ and $T_2 = \\frac{10}{3} \\ \\mathrm{min}$, which are not equal. Therefore, Hypothesis 2 is contradicted by the evidence and must be rejected.\n\nWe conclude that the drug targets the PLC pathway, modulating the parameter $k_{\\mathrm{prod}}$. We are required to compute the fractional change, defined as the ratio $\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{prod,2}}}{k_{\\mathrm{prod,1}}}$.\nFrom our analysis under Hypothesis 1, we found $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{prod,1}}}{k_{\\mathrm{prod,2}}}$.\nInverting this relationship gives the desired ratio:\n$$\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{prod,2}}}{k_{\\mathrm{prod,1}}} = \\frac{T_1}{T_2}$$\nUsing the experimental values:\n$$\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{prod,2}}}{k_{\\mathrm{prod,1}}} = \\frac{2.5}{10/3} = \\frac{5/2}{10/3} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 3}{2 \\cdot 10} = \\frac{15}{20} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\nThe result as a decimal is $0.75$. The drug reduces PLC activity ($k_{\\mathrm{prod}}$) to $75\\%$ of its initial value, which lengthens the interspike period and allows for greater store refilling, thereby increasing the amplitude of the subsequent calcium spike. This is precisely what the data indicates.\nThe final answer is the dimensionless ratio of the kinetic parameters.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.75}\n$$", "id": "2678590"}, {"introduction": "The propagation of the calcium wave relies on regenerative, positive feedback occurring within sub-micron, transient signaling hubs known as calcium microdomains.

A common experimental perturbation is microinjection of exogenous calcium buffers.

Both buffers bind calcium reversibly via $B + \\mathrm{Ca}^{2+} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{CaB}$ with forward (association) rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and reverse (dissociation) rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$.

BAPTA’s high association rate makes its binding time constant much shorter than the microdomain lifetime, clamping free calcium within the microdomain and interrupting CICR; EGTA’s much slower association rate makes it ineffective on microdomain timescales, allowing local $\\mathrm{IP}_3\\mathrm{R}$ activation. In the rapid-buffer regime, fast buffers greatly increase the apparent buffering capacity and reduce the effective calcium diffusion coefficient, suppressing wave propagation.\n\nB.

BAPTA and EGTA should have equivalent effects on oscillations because their equilibrium dissociation constants are similar; microdomain control depends only on affinity, not on binding kinetics.\n\nD.

The analysis must proceed from the first principles given: the law of mass action and diffusion.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the comparison of characteristic timescales: the lifetime of the calcium microdomain, $t_{\\mathrm{md}}$, and the characteristic binding time of each buffer, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{bind}}$. A buffer can only effectively suppress a transient signal if it can bind the signaling molecule, in this case $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, on a timescale shorter than the signal's duration.\n\nLet us determine the characteristic binding time for each buffer. The binding reaction is $B + \\mathrm{Ca}^{2+} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{CaB}$. When the concentration of the free buffer, $[B]$, is much larger than the concentration of free calcium, $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$, the binding process can be approximated by a pseudo-first-order reaction with respect to calcium. The rate of this binding is approximately $k_{\\mathrm{on}}' = k_{\\mathrm{on}}[B]_{\\mathrm{free}}$. The problem states the total injected buffer concentration is $[B]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$. At the resting calcium concentration of $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{rest}} = 0.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and with a dissociation constant $K_{\\mathrm{d}} = 0.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, the fraction of bound buffer is $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]/(K_{\\mathrm{d}} + [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]) = 0.1/(0.2+0.1) = 1/3$. Thus, the free buffer concentration is approximately $[B]_{\\mathrm{free}} \\approx 2/3 \\times [B]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 2/3\\,\\mathrm{mM}$. For an order-of-magnitude calculation, it is sufficient to use $[B]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ as an estimate for the available free buffer concentration, as it is in large excess over the transient calcium levels. The characteristic time to bind calcium, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{on}}$, can therefore be estimated as the inverse of the pseudo-first-order rate constant:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{on}} \\approx \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{on}} [B]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}\n$$\n\nLet us calculate this value for each buffer.\nFor BAPTA:\n$k_{\\mathrm{on}} = 4\\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$ and $[B]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{on, BAPTA}} \\approx \\frac{1}{(4\\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{M})} = \\frac{1}{4\\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 2.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nFor EGTA:\n$k_{\\mathrm{on}} = 1\\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$ and $[B]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{on, EGTA}} \\approx \\frac{1}{(1\\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{M})} = \\frac{1}{1\\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}} = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 1\\,\\mathrm{ms}\n$$\n\nNow, we compare these binding times to the characteristic lifetime of the calcium microdomain, given as $t_{\\mathrm{md}} \\sim 0.1\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nFor BAPTA: $\\tau_{\\mathrm{on, BAPTA}} (2.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}) \\ll t_{\\mathrm{md}} (100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s})$. This inequality demonstrates that BAPTA is a \"fast\" buffer. It reacts and binds calcium ions on a timescale much shorter than the microdomain's existence. Consequently, BAPTA can effectively intercept the $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions as they exit the $\\mathrm{IP}_3\\mathrm{R}$ channel, preventing the local free calcium concentration from reaching the high level ($[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{local}} \\sim 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) required to activate neighboring $\\mathrm{IP}_3\\mathrm{R}$s. This interruption of the positive feedback loop of Calcium-Induced Calcium Release (CICR) abolishes the regenerative wave and the resulting oscillations. This is known as the \"rapid-buffering\" regime. In this regime, the effective diffusion coefficient of calcium, $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is greatly reduced according to $D_{\\mathrm{eff}} = D_{\\mathrm{Ca}}/(1+\\kappa_B)$, where $\\kappa_B$ is the large buffering capacity of the fast buffer. This severely restricts the spatial propagation of the calcium signal.\n\nFor EGTA: $\\tau_{\\mathrm{on, EGTA}} (1\\,\\mathrm{ms}) \\gg t_{\\mathrm{md}} (0.1\\,\\mathrm{ms})$. This inequality demonstrates that EGTA is a \"slow\" buffer. It cannot bind a significant fraction of the released calcium within the microdomain's lifetime. The local peak of $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ is established and can activate nearby $\\mathrm{IP}_3\\mathrm{R}$s before EGTA has had time to act. Therefore, CICR can still be initiated locally. While EGTA will buffer calcium on longer timescales ($> 1\\,\\mathrm{ms}$) and over larger spatial domains (the whole cell), affecting the global properties of the calcium wave (e.g., frequency, amplitude, and velocity), it fails to suppress the fundamental regenerative event at the microdomain level.\n\nTherefore, the profound difference in the association rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$, is responsible for the differential biological effects of BAPTA and EGTA, despite their similar equilibrium affinities ($K_{\\mathrm{d}}$).\n\nNow we evaluate the given options.\n\nA. BAPTA’s high association rate makes its binding time constant much shorter than the microdomain lifetime, clamping free calcium within the microdomain and interrupting CICR; EGTA’s much slower association rate makes it ineffective on microdomain timescales, allowing local $\\mathrm{IP}_3\\mathrm{R}$ activation. In the rapid-buffer regime, fast buffers greatly increase the apparent buffering capacity and reduce the effective calcium diffusion coefficient, suppressing wave propagation.\nThis statement is a precise and accurate summary of the analysis derived above. It correctly identifies the crucial role of the fast binding kinetics of BAPTA relative to the microdomain timescale. It also correctly describes the consequences for buffered diffusion.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. EGTA more effectively abolishes oscillations because its lower affinity selectively buffers high microdomain calcium, preventing $\\mathrm{IP}_3\\mathrm{R}$ activation, whereas BAPTA is saturated at rest and therefore cannot buffer additional calcium during spikes.\nThis statement contains multiple falsities. First, it states that EGTA is more effective, which is contrary to the premise of the problem. Second, it incorrectly claims EGTA has lower affinity; the problem states their $K_{\\mathrm{d}}$ values are nearly identical ($K_{\\mathrm{d}} \\approx 0.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$). Affinity is properly measured by $K_{\\mathrm{d}}$. Third, the claim that BAPTA is saturated at rest is incorrect. At $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{rest}} = 0.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, the fractional saturation is $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]/(K_{\\mathrm{d}}+[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]) = 0.1/0.3 \\approx 0.33$. BAPTA is only $33\\%$ saturated and possesses substantial buffering capacity.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. BAPTA and EGTA should have equivalent effects on oscillations because their equilibrium dissociation constants are similar; microdomain control depends only on affinity, not on binding kinetics.\nThis statement embodies a fundamental misconception. It correctly notes the similar equilibrium constants but incorrectly concludes that kinetics are irrelevant. For rapid, transient signaling events such as those occurring in microdomains, the reaction kinetics ($k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$) are of paramount importance, often more so than the equilibrium affinity ($K_{\\mathrm{d}}$). Our derivation shows this explicitly.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. BAPTA spares oscillations because fast binding promotes long-range spread of calcium by forming mobile calcium–buffer complexes that diffuse faster than free calcium, thereby enhancing wave propagation.\nThis statement is flawed. First, it claims BAPTA spares oscillations, contradicting the problem statement. Second, its reasoning regarding diffusion is biophysically incorrect. Buffer-Ca$^{2+}$ complexes are large molecules that diffuse much more slowly than free $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions ($D_{\\mathrm{CaB}} \\ll D_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$). While mobile buffers can shuttle ligands, the overall effect of a fast buffer is a dramatic reduction in the effective diffusion coefficient of the free ligand, thereby *suppressing* rather than enhancing wave propagation.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. The differential effect arises because EGTA is membrane-impermeant and cannot access the ER lumen to affect store release, whereas BAPTA crosses membranes and chelates luminal calcium, preventing $\\mathrm{IP}_3\\mathrm{R}$-mediated release.\nThis option introduces an external hypothesis not supported by the provided information or general knowledge. Both BAPTA and EGTA in their salt forms are poly-anionic chelators and considered membrane-impermeant. They are microinjected into the cytosol and act there. The explanation for their differential effects is fully contained within the kinetic parameters given in the problem statement and does not require postulating differential membrane permeability or an alternative site of action such as the ER lumen.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2678602"}, {"introduction": "Translating a beautiful microscopy image into a rigorous, quantitative measurement is a cornerstone of modern cell biology.

For independent variables, the variance of the ratio, $\\sigma_{R}^{2}$, is given by:\n$$\\sigma_{R}^{2} \\approx R^{2} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{N_{Y}}}{N_{Y}}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{N_{C}}}{N_{C}}\\right)^{2} \\right] = R^{2} \\left[ \\frac{\\sigma_{N_{Y}}^{2}}{N_{Y}^{2}} + \\frac{\\sigma_{N_{C}}^{2}}{N_{C}^{2}} \\right]$$\nSubstituting $\\sigma_{N_{Y}}^{2} = N_{Y}$ and $\\sigma_{N_{C}}^{2} = N_{C}$:\n$$\\sigma_{R}^{2} = R^{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{N_{Y}} + \\frac{1}{N_{C}} \\right]$$\nNumerically:\n$$\\sigma_{R}^{2} = (1.25)^{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{4000} + \\frac{1}{3200} \\right] = 1.5625 \\left( 0.00025 + 0.0003125 \\right) = 1.5625 (0.0005625) = 0.00087890625$$\n\nNext, we propagate the uncertainty from $R$ to $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$. The variance of $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$, denoted $\\sigma_{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]}^{2}$, is:\n$$\\sigma_{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]}^{2} \\approx \\left( \\frac{d[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]}{dR} \\right)^{2} \\sigma_{R}^{2}$$\nWe must find the derivative $\\frac{d[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]}{dR}$. Using the chain rule, $\\frac{d[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]}{dR} = \\frac{d[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]}{df} \\frac{df}{dR}$.\nThe first derivative is:\n$$\\frac{df}{dR} = \\frac{d}{dR}\\left( \\frac{R - R_{\\min}}{R_{\\max} - R_{\\min}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{R_{\\max} - R_{\\min}} = \\frac{1}{2.00 - 0.80} = \\frac{1}{1.20}$$\nThe second derivative is:\n$$\\frac{d[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]}{df} = \\frac{d}{df}\\left( K_{d} \\frac{f}{1 - f} \\right) = K_{d} \\frac{(1)(1 - f) - (f)(-1)}{(1 - f)^{2}} = \\frac{K_{d}}{(1 - f)^{2}}$$\nAt $f = 0.375$, this is:\n$$\\frac{d[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]}{df} = \\frac{300\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{(1-0.375)^{2}} = \\frac{300\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{(0.625)^{2}} = \\frac{300\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{0.390625} = 768\\,\\mathrm{nM}$$\nCombining these results for the total derivative:\n$$\\frac{d[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]}{dR} = \\frac{d[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]}{df} \\frac{df}{dR} = (768\\,\\mathrm{nM}) \\left( \\frac{1}{1.20} \\right) = 640\\,\\mathrm{nM}$$\nNow we can compute the standard deviation of the calcium concentration, $\\sigma_{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]}$:\n$$\\sigma_{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]} = \\left| \\frac{d[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]}{dR} \\right| \\sigma_{R} = (640\\,\\mathrm{nM}) \\sqrt{0.00087890625} \\approx (640\\,\\mathrm{nM})(0.02964635) \\approx 18.97366\\,\\mathrm{nM}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the two-sided $95\\%$ confidence interval half-width. For a Normal approximation, this is given by $z \\times \\sigma$, where $z \\approx 1.96$ for a $95\\%$ confidence level.\n$$ \\text{Half-width} = 1.96 \\times \\sigma_{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]} \\approx 1.96 \\times 18.97366\\,\\mathrm{nM} \\approx 37.18838\\,\\mathrm{nM} $$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, the half-width is $37.2\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{37.2}$$", "id": "2678609"}]}
