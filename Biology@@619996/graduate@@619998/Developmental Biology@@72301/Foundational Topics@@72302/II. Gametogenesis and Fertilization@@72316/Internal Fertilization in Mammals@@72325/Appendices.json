It requires a derivation from first principles based on the provided definition of buffer capacity, not merely the application of a pre-memorized formula.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation from first principles based on the definition of buffer capacity, $\\beta$. The definition states that $\\beta$ is the amount of strong base, $n_{b}$, (in moles per liter) required to cause a unit change in pH. For a solution of volume $V$, the total number of moles of strong base, $N_{b}$, required to produce a finite change in pH, $\\Delta(\\mathrm{pH})$, is given by:\n$$ \\Delta N_{b} = \\beta \\cdot V \\cdot \\Delta(\\mathrm{pH}) $$\nThis expression assumes $\\beta$ is constant over the pH interval, as stated in the problem.\nSimilarly, the amount of strong acid, $N_{a}$, required to produce a change $\\Delta(\\mathrm{pH})$ is:\n$$ \\Delta N_{a} = -\\beta \\cdot V \\cdot \\Delta(\\mathrm{pH}) = \\beta \\cdot V \\cdot (-\\Delta(\\mathrm{pH})) $$\n\nLet the final pH of the mixture be $\\mathrm{pH}_{f}$.\nThe vaginal fluid, being acidic, will experience an increase in pH. The change in its pH is $\\Delta(\\mathrm{pH}_{v}) = \\mathrm{pH}_{f} - \\mathrm{pH}_{v,0}$. This change is equivalent to the effect of adding an amount of strong base, $\\Delta N_{b,v}$, to the vaginal fluid.\n$$ \\Delta N_{b,v} = \\beta_{v} V_{v} (\\mathrm{pH}_{f} - \\mathrm{pH}_{v,0}) $$\nSince we expect $\\mathrm{pH}_{f} > \\mathrm{pH}_{v,0}$, this quantity $\\Delta N_{b,v}$ will be positive.\n\nThe semen, being alkaline, will experience a decrease in pH. The change in its pH is $\\Delta(\\mathrm{pH}_{s}) = \\mathrm{pH}_{f} - \\mathrm{pH}_{s,0}$. This change is equivalent to the effect of adding an amount of strong acid, $\\Delta N_{a,s}$, to the semen.\n$$ \\Delta N_{a,s} = -\\beta_{s} V_{s} (\\mathrm{pH}_{f} - \\mathrm{pH}_{s,0}) $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\Delta N_{a,s} = \\beta_{s} V_{s} (\\mathrm{pH}_{s,0} - \\mathrm{pH}_{f}) $$\nSince we expect $\\mathrm{pH}_{f} < \\mathrm{pH}_{s,0}$, this quantity $\\Delta N_{a,s}$ will be positive.\n\nThe system is closed. The buffering action involves the transfer of protons or their equivalents between the two solutions. The effective amount of strong base \"added\" to the vaginal fluid must equal the effective amount of strong acid \"added\" to the semen. This is the principle of conservation of strong-acid/strong-base equivalents.\n$$ \\Delta N_{b,v} = \\Delta N_{a,s} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for these quantities yields the governing equation:\n$$ \\beta_{v} V_{v} (\\mathrm{pH}_{f} - \\mathrm{pH}_{v,0}) = \\beta_{s} V_{s} (\\mathrm{pH}_{s,0} - \\mathrm{pH}_{f}) $$\nThis equation must be solved for $\\mathrm{pH}_{f}$.

The units for volume ($V_v, V_s$) are given in $\\mathrm{mL}$ while the units for buffer capacity ($\\beta_v, \\beta_s$) are per Liter. We can use the volumes directly in $\\mathrm{mL}$ because the unit conversion factor from $\\mathrm{mL}$ to $\\mathrm{L}$ ($10^{-3}$) would appear in every term in both the numerator and the denominator, and thus cancel out.\n\nThe given values are:\n$V_{v} = 1.2$\n$\\mathrm{pH}_{v,0} = 4.2$\n$\\beta_{v} = 0.020$\n$V_{s} = 3.0$\n$\\mathrm{pH}_{s,0} = 7.5$\n$\\beta_{s} = 0.050$\n\nCalculate the products in the numerator:\n$\\beta_{v} V_{v} \\mathrm{pH}_{v,0} = (0.020) \\cdot (1.2) \\cdot (4.2) = 0.1008$\n$\\beta_{s} V_{s} \\mathrm{pH}_{s,0} = (0.050) \\cdot (3.0) \\cdot (7.5) = 1.125$\n\nCalculate the products in the denominator:\n$\\beta_{v} V_{v} = (0.020) \\cdot (1.2) = 0.024$\n$\\beta_{s} V_{s} = (0.050) \\cdot (3.0) = 0.150$\n\nSubstitute these values into the expression for $\\mathrm{pH}_{f}$:\n$$ \\mathrm{pH}_{f} = \\frac{0.1008 + 1.125}{0.024 + 0.150} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{pH}_{f} = \\frac{1.2258}{0.174} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{pH}_{f} \\approx 7.044827586... $$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$ \\mathrm{pH}_{f} = 7.04 $$\nThis result is physiologically significant, as a pH near neutrality is optimal for sperm motility and viability.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.04}$$", "id": "2646369"}, {"introduction": "Once deposited, semen in many primate species undergoes a remarkable transformation from a gel-like coagulum to a liquid, a process essential for releasing motile sperm.

It is therefore a valid problem and we will proceed to find a solution.\n\nThe problem states that the rate of loss of the fraction of intact coagulum, $F(t)$, is proportional to the fraction itself. This is the definition of a first-order process. We can express this statement as a differential equation. The \"rate of loss of $F(t)$\" is mathematically written as $-\\frac{dF(t)}{dt}$. This rate is proportional to $F(t)$ with an effective rate constant $k$. Therefore, the governing differential equation is:\n$$\n-\\frac{dF(t)}{dt} = k F(t)\n$$\nwhere $k$ is a positive constant. This equation is more conventionally written as:\n$$\n\\frac{dF(t)}{dt} = -k F(t)\n$$\nThis is a separable first-order ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separating the variables $F$ and $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{dF}{F} = -k \\, dt\n$$\nNext, we integrate both sides of the equation.

The problem states that initially the coagulum is fully intact, which gives the initial condition $F(0)=1$.
