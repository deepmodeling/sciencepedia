The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded in the established principles of biophysical modeling of gene regulation.\n\nWe begin by formalizing the system. The promoter can exist in one of three mutually exclusive states:\n$1$. The promoter is empty (unbound).\n$2$. The promoter is bound by a single RNA polymerase (RNAP) molecule.\n$3$. The promoter is bound by a single repressor protein molecule.\n\nAccording to the prompt, the statistical weight of each state is proportional to $\\exp(-\\beta \\Delta \\epsilon)$, where $\\beta = (k_B T)^{-1}$ and $\\Delta \\epsilon$ is the binding energy of the protein to its specific site on the DNA relative to a nonspecific site. The weights must also account for the concentration of the molecules. The effective concentration is given as the copy number of the protein divided by the number of nonspecific binding sites in the cell, $N_{\\text{NS}}$.\n\nLet us define the statistical weights for each state:\nThe empty state of the promoter is the reference state, so its statistical weight is set to $1$.\nThe statistical weight for the RNAP-bound state, which we denote as $w_p$, is:\n$$w_p = \\frac{P}{N_{\\text{NS}}} \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta \\epsilon_p)$$\nwhere $P$ is the copy number of RNAP and $\\Delta \\epsilon_p$ is its specific-to-nonspecific binding energy difference.\n\nThe statistical weight for the repressor-bound state, denoted as $w_r$, is:\n$$w_r = \\frac{R}{N_{\\text{NS}}} \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta \\epsilon_r)$$\nwhere $R$ is the copy number of the repressor and $\\Delta \\epsilon_r$ is its specific-to-nonspecific binding energy difference.\n\nThe partition function, $Z$, which is the sum of the statistical weights of all possible states, is given by:\n$$Z = 1 + w_p + w_r$$\nThis partition function accounts for all three possible configurations of the promoter when both RNAP and repressor are present.\n\nThe probability of finding the promoter in any particular state is the statistical weight of that state divided by the partition function. The problem states that the transcriptional output is proportional to the probability of RNAP being bound to the promoter, $p_{\\text{bound}}$. Therefore, with the repressor present, this probability is:\n$$p_{\\text{bound}}(R>0) = \\frac{w_p}{Z} = \\frac{w_p}{1 + w_p + w_r}$$\n\nTo calculate the fold-change, we must also determine the RNAP occupancy in the absence of the repressor. In this scenario, the repressor copy number $R = 0$, which implies that its statistical weight $w_r = 0$. The system can only be in the empty or RNAP-bound state. The partition function for this unregulated system, $Z_0$, is:\n$$Z_0 = 1 + w_p$$\nThe probability of RNAP binding in the absence of the repressor is then:\n$$p_{\\text{bound}}(R=0) = \\frac{w_p}{Z_0} = \\frac{w_p}{1 + w_p}$$\n\nThe fold-change, $FC$, is defined as the ratio of RNAP occupancy with the repressor present to that without the repressor:\n$$FC = \\frac{p_{\\text{bound}}(R>0)}{p_{\\text{bound}}(R=0)} = \\frac{\\frac{w_p}{1 + w_p + w_r}}{\\frac{w_p}{1 + w_p}}$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the general formula for fold-change:\n$$FC = \\frac{1 + w_p}{1 + w_p + w_r}$$\nThis is the derived analytical expression for the fold-change.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided parameters:\n- RNAP copy number $P = 2000$\n- Repressor copy number $R = 50$\n- Number of nonspecific DNA binding sites $N_{\\text{NS}} = 4.6 \\times 10^{6}$\n- RNAP binding energy $\\Delta \\epsilon_{p} = -5 \\, k_B T$, which implies $-\\beta \\Delta \\epsilon_{p} = 5$\n- Repressor binding energy $\\Delta \\epsilon_{r} = -15 \\, k_B T$, which implies $-\\beta \\Delta \\epsilon_{r} = 15$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless statistical weights $w_p$ and $w_r$:\n$$w_p = \\frac{2000}{4.6 \\times 10^6} \\exp\\left(5\\right) \\approx (4.3478 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times 148.413 \\approx 0.064525$$\n$$w_r = \\frac{50}{4.6 \\times 10^6} \\exp\\left(15\\right) \\approx (1.0870 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times (3.2690 \\times 10^6) \\approx 35.5328$$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the fold-change expression:\n$$FC = \\frac{1 + w_p}{1 + w_p + w_r} = \\frac{1 + 0.064525}{1 + 0.064525 + 35.5328} = \\frac{1.064525}{36.597325} \\approx 0.0290876$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, the fold-change is $0.02909$.\n\nFinally, we must determine the dominance indicator $D$:\n$$D \\equiv \\begin{cases} 1, & \\text{if } w_r > \\max\\{1, w_p\\},\\\\ 0, & \\text{otherwise.} \\end{cases}$$\nWe have calculated $w_p \\approx 0.0645$ and $w_r \\approx 35.53$.\nWe evaluate the condition $\\max\\{1, w_p\\}$:\n$$\\max\\{1, 0.0645\\} = 1$$\nThe condition for $D=1$ becomes $w_r > 1$.\nSince $w_r \\approx 35.53$, and $35.53 > 1$, the condition is satisfied.\nTherefore, the dominance indicator $D = 1$. This indicates that in this regime, the repressor's binding contribution ($w_r$) is the dominant factor in setting the promoter's state, being larger than both the weight of the empty state ($1$) and the RNAP-bound state ($w_p$).\n\nThe final result consists of the calculated fold-change and the dominance indicator.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.02909 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2540934"}, {"introduction": "Transcriptional regulation is not just a numbers game of molecular concentrations; it is profoundly influenced by the precise three-dimensional architecture of the promoter region.

Two promoter architectures are considered: a Class I CRP-dependent promoter with a CRP site centered at position $-61.5$ relative to the transcription start site, and a Class II CRP-dependent promoter with a CRP site centered at $-41.5$. In Class I, activation is known to occur primarily through an interaction between CRP activating region $1$ (AR$1$) and the C-terminal domain of the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP $\\alpha$-CTD). In Class II, activation involves multiple contacts, notably CRP AR$1$–RNAP $\\alpha$-CTD, CRP AR$2$–RNAP alpha N-terminal domain (RNAP $\\alpha$-NTD), and CRP AR$3$–sigma factor region $4$ ($\\sigma^{70}$ region $4$) that engages the promoter $-35$ element. Assume that the concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is saturating, CRP occupancy of its site is high, and other promoter elements are unchanged.\n\nYou experimentally move the CRP binding site upstream by $5$ base pairs (bp) in both promoters, preserving the site sequence and spacing to adjacent promoter elements except for the $5$ bp upstream shift.

Activation mechanism is primarily via CRP Activating Region $1$ (AR$1$) interaction with the RNA polymerase $\\alpha$-subunit C-terminal domain (RNAP $\\alpha$-CTD).\n-   **Class II Promoter:** CRP binding site centered at position $-41.5$. Activation involves multiple contacts: CRP AR$1$–RNAP $\\alpha$-CTD, CRP AR$2$–RNAP $\\alpha$-subunit N-terminal domain (RNAP $\\alpha$-NTD), and CRP AR$3$–$\\sigma^{70}$ factor region $4$.\n-   **Assumptions:** Saturating cAMP concentration, high CRP occupancy, other promoter elements are constant.\n-   **Perturbation:** The CRP binding site is moved upstream by $5$ base pairs (bp).\n-   **DNA Properties:** Right-handed helix, helical repeat of $\\approx 10.5$ bp/turn, rotational advance of $\\approx 34.3^{\\circ}$/bp, and helical rise of $\\approx 0.34$ nm/bp.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, describing well-established mechanisms of bacterial gene regulation. The provided positions for Class I and Class II promoters ($-61.5$ and $-41.5$) are canonical. The stated protein-protein interactions (AR$1$–$\\alpha$-CTD, etc.) are standard textbook knowledge. The physical properties of DNA are stated correctly. The experimental setup (moving a binding site) is a standard technique in molecular genetics. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a logical conclusion. It does not violate any criteria for validity.\n\n### Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\n\nThe analysis rests on understanding the geometric consequences of shifting a protein binding site along the DNA helix. The key parameters are the change in rotational angle (helical phasing) and the change in axial distance between the interacting proteins.\n\nA shift of $\\Delta L = 5$ bp has the following consequences:\n1.  **Rotational Change ($\\Delta\\theta$):** The DNA helix rotates by approximately $34.3^{\\circ}$ per base pair. A $5$ bp shift results in a total rotation of:\n    $$ \\Delta\\theta = 5 \\text{ bp} \\times 34.3^{\\circ}/\\text{bp} = 171.5^{\\circ} $$\n    This rotation is very close to $180^{\\circ}$, meaning that the CRP protein, when bound to the new site, will be on the opposite face of the DNA helix compared to its original position. A full helical turn, which would restore the original rotational orientation, is approximately $10.5$ bp. A $5$ bp shift corresponds to approximately half a helical turn ($5/10.5 \\approx 0.476$), leading to maximal rotational misalignment.\n\n2.  **Axial Distance Change ($\\Delta z$):** The DNA helix has a rise of approximately $0.34$ nm per base pair. An upstream shift of $5$ bp increases the axial separation between CRP and the RNAP holoenzyme by:\n    $$ \\Delta z = 5 \\text{ bp} \\times 0.34 \\text{ nm/bp} = 1.7 \\text{ nm} $$\n\nNow, we must apply these geometric changes to each promoter class.\n\n**Analysis of the Class I Promoter:**\n-   **Original State:** At position $-61.5$, CRP is positioned optimally for its Activating Region $1$ (AR$1$) to contact the RNAP $\\alpha$-CTD. This interaction is mediated by a long, flexible polypeptide linker that connects the $\\alpha$-CTD to the core RNAP enzyme. This flexibility allows the $\\alpha$-CTD to search for and bind to upstream activators over a range of distances and, to a lesser extent, rotational phases.\n-   **Effect of the Shift:** The CRP site moves to $-61.5 - 5 = -66.5$. The CRP molecule is now presented on the opposite face of the DNA helix ($\\Delta\\theta \\approx 180^{\\circ}$) and is $1.7$ nm further away from the promoter. The severe rotational misalignment will disrupt the AR$1$–$\\alpha$-CTD interaction. However, the inherent flexibility of the $\\alpha$-CTD linker may allow it to \"wrap around\" the DNA to some degree to make a suboptimal contact. This means the interaction is significantly weakened, leading to a strong reduction in transcriptional activation, but it might not be completely abolished. The flexibility provides a degree of tolerance to phasing changes that is not present in more rigid interactions.\n\n**Analysis of the Class II Promoter:**\n-   **Original State:** At position $-41.5$, CRP is immediately adjacent to the core promoter and makes multiple, structurally precise contacts with the RNAP holoenzyme. These include:\n    -   AR$1$–$\\alpha$-CTD.\n    -   AR$2$–$\\alpha$-NTD (a domain within the rigidly structured core of RNAP).\n    -   AR$3$–$\\sigma^{70}$ region $4$ (crucial for stabilizing the $\\sigma$ factor's interaction with the $-35$ promoter element).\n    These latter two contacts (AR$2$ and AR$3$) are known to be stereospecific and depend on a fixed geometric arrangement between CRP and RNAP.\n-   **Effect of the Shift:** The CRP site moves to $-41.5 - 5 = -46.5$. This introduces both a $\\approx 180^{\\circ}$ rotational misalignment and an increased axial separation of $1.7$ nm. For rigid, stereospecific protein-protein interactions like AR$2$–$\\alpha$-NTD and AR$3$–$\\sigma^{70}$, this large geometric perturbation is catastrophic. The relevant activating regions on CRP will now face away from their binding partners on RNAP, and the increased distance further prevents any contact. Unlike the Class I scenario, there is no long flexible linker to compensate for such a drastic change. All critical activating contacts are simultaneously disrupted.\n-   **Conclusion:** The effect on the Class II promoter will be a much more severe reduction in activation, likely approaching complete abolishment.\n\n**Summary of Predictions:**\n-   **Class I:** Activation is strongly reduced due to rotational misphasing, but not abolished, due to the partial tolerance afforded by the flexible $\\alpha$-CTD linker.\n-   **Class II:** Activation is very severely reduced, likely near-abolished, because the rigid, stereospecific contacts (AR$2$, AR$3$) are intolerant to the large disruption in both rotational phase and axial distance.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Class I activation will be strongly reduced but not abolished because AR$1$–RNAP $\\alpha$-CTD contact becomes misphased yet partially tolerated by $\\alpha$-CTD flexibility; Class II activation will be reduced more severely, often near-abolished, because the AR$3$–$\\sigma^{70}$ region $4$ contact (and AR$2$–$\\alpha$-NTD geometry) is disrupted by both rotational misalignment and increased axial spacing.**\nThis option correctly identifies that the $5$ bp shift causes rotational misphasing. It accurately describes the consequences for Class I activation: a strong reduction that is mitigated from complete abolishment by the flexibility of the $\\alpha$-CTD linker. It also correctly predicts a more severe, near-abolishing effect on Class II activation, attributing this to the disruption of rigid contacts (AR$3$–$\\sigma^{70}$ and implicitly AR$2$–$\\alpha$-NTD) by both rotation and distance. This aligns perfectly with the derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Class I activation will be unchanged because RNAP $\\alpha$-CTD can reposition to maintain AR$1$ contact; Class II activation will show only a modest decrease due to redundancy of CRP contacts.**\nThis option overestimates the compensatory ability of the $\\alpha$-CTD linker. A $\\approx 180^{\\circ}$ phase shift is a major energetic barrier, and activation will not be unchanged. For Class II, it misinterprets redundancy; when a geometric shift disrupts all contacts simultaneously, redundancy offers no benefit. The decrease would be severe, not modest.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Class I activation will increase due to improved alignment of AR$1$ with RNAP $\\alpha$-CTD at the shifted position; Class II activation will be unchanged because CRP primarily contacts DNA rather than RNAP at Class II promoters.**\nThe initial position of $-61.5$ is known to be phased correctly for activation. Shifting CRP to the opposite face of the DNA will worsen, not improve, alignment. The claim for Class II is factually wrong; Class II activation is defined by its multiple, essential protein-protein contacts between CRP and RNAP.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Both Class I and Class II activation will be unchanged because a $5$ bp shift returns CRP to the same DNA face and preserves all protein–protein contacts; any helical phasing effect requires a $10$ bp shift.**\nThis option is based on a fundamental an erroneous understanding of DNA helical structure. A $5$ bp shift is approximately half a helical turn, moving a protein to the *opposite* face of the DNA. A $\\approx 10.5$ bp shift, not a $5$ bp shift, would restore the same-face orientation. The premise of this option is factually incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2540954"}, {"introduction": "A central activity in modern biology is the development of mathematical models to interpret quantitative experimental data.

The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution is tractable.\n\nThe core of this problem is to model the steady-state transcriptional response of a promoter to varying concentrations of an effector molecule, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The response is assumed to follow a sigmoidal dose-response curve, a common characteristic of systems involving cooperative binding. The Hill equation is a canonical mathematical model for such phenomena.

This is achieved by fitting the model to the experimental data. The method of choice is nonlinear least-squares regression. This involves finding the set of parameters that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals, $\\chi^2$, which is the discrepancy between the measured promoter activities, $y_{i, \\text{data}}$, and the activities predicted by the model, $y(x_i; b, A, K, n)$, over all $N$ data points:\n$$ \\chi^2(b, A, K, n) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} [y_{i, \\text{data}} - y(x_i; b, A, K, n)]^2 $$\nThis minimization is a numerical optimization problem. We must respect the physical meaning of the parameters by imposing constraints: $b \\ge 0$, $A \\ge 0$, $K > 0$, and $n > 0$. These constraints are implemented as bounds in the optimization algorithm.\n\nThe central biophysical interpretation rests on the value of the fitted Hill coefficient, $\\hat{n}$. The transcription factor in question, CRP, is a dimer, and each monomer has a binding site for cAMP. A simplified model of ligand binding to a multi-site protein predicts a theoretical maximum Hill coefficient equal to the number of binding sites, which is $n=2$ for a CRP dimer under the assumption of strong cooperativity. Therefore, the value of the empirical Hill coefficient $\\hat{n}$ is compared to this theoretical value.\n- If $\\hat{n}$ is found to be in the range $[\\,1.75,\\,2.25\\,]$ (code $0$), the observed cooperativity is consistent with the standard model of two cooperative cAMP binding events on a CRP dimer.\n- If $\\hat{n} > 2.25$ (code $1$), the system exhibits supercooperativity. This implies that additional cooperative interactions, such as cooperative binding of multiple CRP-cAMP complexes to the DNA, are likely at play.\n- If $\\hat{n} < 1.75$ (code $-1$), the system is subcooperative. This can be caused by negative cooperativity between binding sites, measurement artifacts, or heterogeneity in the molecular population being measured.\n\nThe implementation will utilize the `scipy.optimize.curve_fit` function, which is well-suited for this type of regression analysis. For each of the four datasets, we will:\n1.  Provide the experimental data $(x_i, y_i)$.\n2.  Perform the bounded nonlinear least-squares fit of the Hill equation to find the optimal parameters $(\\hat{b}, \\hat{A}, \\hat{K}, \\hat{n})$.\n3.  Extract the fitted Hill coefficient $\\hat{n}$.\n4.  Apply the specified classification rule to determine the cooperativity code $c \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n5.  Format the results, consisting of the rounded $\\hat{n}$ and its corresponding code $c$, into the specified list structure for final output.\nThis procedure is repeated for all four datasets to complete the analysis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\text{[[2.000,0],[4.000,1],[1.200,-1],[2.000,0]]}}$$", "id": "2540956"}]}
