This exercise guides you through a first-principles derivation to model the steady-state level of hemimethylated DNA, a transient but crucial intermediate in methylation maintenance. By treating replication and methylation as stochastic processes, you will develop a simple but powerful kinetic model that connects observable epigenetic patterns to the underlying rates of key molecular events, a fundamental skill in quantitative biology [@problem_id:2490549].", "problem": "A bacterium has a chromosome carrying a methylation motif at density $d$ sites per base pair. In this organism, each motif that is fully methylated before replication becomes hemimethylated immediately upon passage of the replication fork, and a dedicated maintenance methyltransferase restores full methylation post-replication. Assume the following foundational facts: (i) semiconservative replication generates a transient hemimethylated state at methylation motifs that were fully methylated prior to replication, (ii) the timing of replication encounters at a given site can be modeled as a memoryless arrival process, and (iii) post-replicative maintenance methylation at a hemimethylated site is a stochastic process with a memoryless waiting time. Let $r$ denote the replication hazard for a given motif (replications per unit time at that locus), $k$ denote the post-replicative maintenance methylation rate per hemimethylated site, and $d$ denote the motif density. Using only these foundational facts and the properties of memoryless (Poisson) processes, derive from first principles the steady-state fraction $f^{\\ast}$ of hemimethylated motif sites among all motif copies as a function of $r$, $d$, and $k$. Clearly state the mechanistic assumptions required for the approximation you use. Express your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression with no units.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation and is found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular biology and can be formalized using standard methods of statistical mechanics and chemical kinetics. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, permitting a unique solution to be derived from first principles. The parameter $d$, the motif density, is noted as potentially extraneous for the specific quantity requested, but its presence does not invalidate the problem.\n\nWe proceed with the derivation. The problem requires us to find the steady-state fraction of hemimethylated motif sites, which we denote as $f^{\\ast}$. We model the dynamics of a single, representative methylation motif. The problem describes a cycle between two states: fully methylated, which we will denote by $M$, and hemimethylated, denoted by $H$. Let $f_{M}(t)$ and $f_{H}(t)$ be the fractions of all motif sites that are in the fully methylated and hemimethylated states, respectively, at time $t$. As these are the only two states considered in the kinetic cycle, the fractions must sum to unity at all times:\n$$\nf_{M}(t) + f_{H}(t) = 1\n$$\nThe dynamics of the system are governed by two stochastic processes with memoryless waiting times, as stated in the problem.\n\n$1$. **Replication**: A fully methylated site ($M$) becomes hemimethylated ($H$) upon replication. The problem defines a replication hazard $r$ for a given motif, which is the rate constant for this transition. The process can be written as:\n$$\nM \\xrightarrow{r} H\n$$\nThe rate of this process is proportional to the fraction of sites that are in the fully methylated state, $f_{M}(t)$. Thus, the rate of increase of the hemimethylated fraction due to replication is $r \\cdot f_{M}(t)$.\n\n$2$. **Maintenance Methylation**: A hemimethylated site ($H$) is restored to the fully methylated state ($M$) by a maintenance methyltransferase. This is also a memoryless stochastic process with a rate $k$ per site. The process is:\n$$\nH \\xrightarrow{k} M\n$$\nThe rate of this process is proportional to the fraction of sites that are in the hemimethylated state, $f_{H}(t)$. Thus, the rate of decrease of the hemimethylated fraction due to methylation is $k \\cdot f_{H}(t)$.\n\nWe can now write a rate equation, or master equation, for the fraction of hemimethylated sites, $f_{H}(t)$. The rate of change of $f_{H}(t)$ is the rate of formation of $H$ sites minus the rate of their removal.\n$$\n\\frac{d f_{H}(t)}{dt} = (\\text{rate of } M \\to H) - (\\text{rate of } H \\to M)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the rates, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{d f_{H}(t)}{dt} = r \\cdot f_{M}(t) - k \\cdot f_{H}(t)\n$$\nTo solve this equation, we use the conservation relation $f_{M}(t) = 1 - f_{H}(t)$ to express the dynamics solely in terms of $f_{H}(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d f_{H}(t)}{dt} = r \\cdot (1 - f_{H}(t)) - k \\cdot f_{H}(t)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the steady-state fraction, $f^{\\ast}$. At steady state, the fractions of sites in each state are constant, which implies that the time derivative is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d f_{H}}{dt} = 0\n$$\nLet $f^{\\ast}$ be the value of $f_{H}$ at steady state. The steady-state condition is therefore:\n$$\nr \\cdot (1 - f^{\\ast}) - k \\cdot f^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\nWe now solve this algebraic equation for $f^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nr - r \\cdot f^{\\ast} - k \\cdot f^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\n$$\nr = r \\cdot f^{\\ast} + k \\cdot f^{\\ast}\n$$\n$$\nr = (r + k) \\cdot f^{\\ast}\n$$\nThis gives the final expression for the steady-state fraction of hemimethylated sites:\n$$\nf^{\\ast} = \\frac{r}{r + k}\n$$\nThe parameter $d$, the density of motifs, does not appear in the final expression. This is because the problem asks for a *fraction*, which is an intensive quantity. The calculation considers the probability that any single site is hemimethylated, which at steady state is independent of how many other sites exist. The parameter $d$ would be necessary to calculate an extensive quantity, such as the total number of hemimethylated sites per unit length of the chromosome, which would be given by the product $d \\cdot f^{\\ast}$.\n\nThe key mechanistic assumptions required for this derivation are:\n- The system can be described by a two-state model for each motif site: fully methylated ($M$) and hemimethylated ($H$). The existence of unmethylated sites is neglected, which is consistent with the focus on \"maintenance\" rather than \"de novo\" methylation.\n- The transition from $M$ to $H$ (replication) and from $H$ to $M$ (methylation) are first-order kinetic processes with constant rate parameters $r$ and $k$, respectively. This is a direct consequence of the problem stating these are memoryless processes.\n- The states of individual methylation motifs are statistically independent.\n- The system is large enough (many motifs on the chromosome) that the fractions $f_{M}$ and $f_{H}$ can be treated as continuous variables representing population averages.\n- The system reaches a stable steady state.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{r}{r+k}}\n$$", "id": "2490549"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond observing natural epigenetic patterns, modern synthetic biology offers tools to actively write them onto the genome.

You will use a DNA-binding programmable module, nuclease-dead Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-associated protein 9 (dCas9), fused to a methyltransferase. You have available an Escherichia coli strain in which the endogenous DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam) and DNA cytosine methyltransferase (Dcm) are deleted, denoted `dam⁻ dcm⁻`. You will target a locus that contains two $5^{\\prime}$-GATC-$3^{\\prime}$ motifs within $50$ base pairs of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) compatible with Streptococcus pyogenes dCas9 ($5^{\\prime}$-NGG-$3^{\\prime}$).

Use a dCas9-Dam fusion with a hypomorphic Dam variant to reduce background activity, expressed in the dam⁻ dcm⁻ strain. Design a guide ribonucleic acid (gRNA) that targets dCas9 adjacent (within $<50$ base pairs) to the GATC motifs. Perform a short induction ($2$ minutes) followed by rapid shutoff with anti-CRISPR and glucose. Collect a time course at $t \\in \\{0,5,10,30,60\\}$ minutes for SMRT sequencing to obtain $m_i(t)$ at every GATC, and perform dCas9 ChIP-seq in parallel to estimate $\\theta_i$. Include the following controls: dCas9-Dam with a catalytically inactive Dam mutant, dCas9 alone, Dam alone (untethered), a scrambled gRNA, and a $2$-mismatch gRNA that preserves PAM but reduces on-target binding affinity. Quantify off-target specificity as the distribution of initial slopes $\\left.\\frac{d m_i}{d t}\\right|_{t \\to 0}$ at sites $i$ lacking designed gRNA complementarity, corrected by background from catalytically inactive controls, and report the fraction of methylation occurring outside a $\\pm 200$ base pair window around the target versus genome-wide.

Use a dCas9-M.SssI (CpG $5$-methylcytosine) fusion expressed in wild-type Escherichia coli. Design a gRNA to the locus of interest and perform a $24$-hour induction. Quantify methylation at the target using sodium bisulfite sequencing at endpoint, and estimate off-target methylation by counting bisulfite-resistant cytosines within $\\pm 5$ kilobases of the target. Kinetics are inferred by comparing endpoint methylation fractions at the target from two independent cultures.\n\nC. Use catalytically active Cas9 fused to the non-specific adenine methyltransferase M.EcoGII to maximize local m$^{6}$A deposition at cut sites. Induce expression for $6$ hours and quantify methylation globally with DpnI digestion followed by gel electrophoresis. Off-targets are defined by any DNA fragments that resist DpnI digestion. Kinetic specificity is estimated from the intensity of the gel bands.\n\nD. Use dCas9-Dam in the dam⁻ dcm⁻ strain with continuous expression for $12$ hours and a single endpoint SMRT sequencing measurement. Include a scrambled gRNA control. Define off-target methylation as any m$^{6}$A at sites not within $\\pm 50$ base pairs of the target and define kinetic specificity as the endpoint on-target methylation fraction.\n\nSelect the single best option.", "solution": "The problem requires the design of an experiment to achieve three goals: (i) targeted deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation, (ii) genome-wide quantification of off-target methylation, and (iii) extraction of per-site kinetic parameters that separate DNA binding from enzymatic catalysis. The provided tools and constraints include a dCas$9$-methyltransferase fusion, an *Escherichia coli* strain lacking endogenous methyltransferases (`dam⁻ dcm⁻`), precise temporal control over expression, and genome-scale measurement techniques (SMRT sequencing for $N^6$-methyladenine (m$^6$A) and ChIP-seq for dCas$9$ occupancy). The problem assumes methylation follows first-order kinetics with respect to the unmethylated fraction and that binding is much faster than catalysis.\n\nA valid experimental design must satisfy all three requirements.\n1.  **Targeted Writing:** This requires a programmable DNA binding module (dCas$9$) fused to a specific writer enzyme (a DNA methyltransferase). The choice of enzyme must be compatible with the measurement modality.\n2.  **Off-Target Quantification:** This necessitates a genome-wide measurement of the written mark (m$^6$A) and a set of controls to distinguish dCas$9$-guided methylation from background or non-specific enzyme activity. SMRT sequencing is the specified method for m$^6$A, making it suitable.\n3.  **Kinetic Parameter Extraction:** This is the most demanding requirement. To separate binding from catalysis, one needs to measure both the rate of methylation and the occupancy of the enzyme at each site. The rate cannot be determined from a single endpoint measurement; it requires a time-course experiment. The rate of change of the methylation fraction $m_i(t)$ at site $i$ is given by a first-order process:\n$$ \\frac{d m_i(t)}{dt} = k_{\\text{eff},i} (1 - m_i(t)) $$\nwhere $k_{\\text{eff},i}$ is the effective rate constant at site $i$, and $(1 - m_i(t))$ is the fraction of unmethylated DNA. At early time points ($t \\to 0$), we have $m_i(t) \\approx 0$, so the initial rate is:\n$$ \\left.\\frac{d m_i}{d t}\\right|_{t \\to 0} \\approx k_{\\text{eff},i} $$\nThis initial rate is proportional to the local concentration of the enzyme, which is in turn proportional to the dCas$9$ occupancy, $\\theta_i$. We can thus write $k_{\\text{eff},i} = k_{\\text{cat},i} \\cdot \\theta_i$, where $k_{\\text{cat},i}$ represents the intrinsic catalytic rate constant once the enzyme is bound near site $i$. To disentangle these factors, one must solve for $k_{\\text{cat},i}$:\n$$ k_{\\text{cat},i} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\theta_i} \\left.\\frac{d m_i}{d t}\\right|_{t \\to 0} $$\nThis mathematical relationship dictates the experimental needs: a time-course measurement of $m_i(t)$ to estimate the initial slope $\\left.\\frac{d m_i}{d t}\\right|_{t \\to 0}$, and a parallel measurement of protein occupancy $\\theta_i$ via ChIP-seq.\n\nLet us evaluate each option based on these principles.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\n- **Methodology:** Proposes a dCas$9$-Dam fusion in the correct `dam⁻ dcm⁻` strain. Dam methylates adenine in GATC sequences, producing m$^6$A, which is directly quantifiable by SMRT sequencing. The use of a hypomorphic Dam variant is a sound choice, as it slows catalysis, making the time course easier to resolve and reinforcing the assumption that binding is faster than catalysis. The proposed pulse-chase experiment (short induction, rapid shutoff) is ideal for studying kinetics by synchronizing the system. The parallel measurements of $m_i(t)$ via a SMRT time course and $\\theta_i$ via ChIP-seq provide precisely the data needed.\n- **Controls:** The list of controls is exhaustive and appropriate. A catalytically inactive dCas$9$-Dam fusion isolates effects of binding alone. Untethered Dam quantifies background methylation. A scrambled gRNA confirms the specificity of the guide. A mismatch gRNA allows for a direct test of the relationship between binding affinity ($\\theta_i$) and methylation rate.\n- **Quantification:** The proposed analysis is rigorous. It correctly identifies the need to measure initial slopes for kinetics and uses the correct formula, $k_{\\text{cat},i} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\theta_i}\\left.\\frac{d m_i}{d t}\\right|_{t \\to 0}$, to separate binding from catalysis. The approach to quantifying off-target activity is also robust and genome-wide.\n- **Verdict:** This option presents a comprehensive, well-designed, and scientifically sound experiment that directly addresses all three objectives of the problem statement. **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\n- **Methodology:** Proposes using a dCas$9$-M.SssI fusion. M.SssI is a CpG methyltransferase, creating $5$-methylcytosine (m$^5$C). This is mismatched with the specified target locus (GATC motifs) and the specified measurement technique (SMRT for m$^6$A). Using a wild-type *E. coli* strain introduces confounding background from the endogenous Dcm methylase, which also targets cytosine. The proposed $24$-hour induction is an endpoint experiment, which cannot be used to determine kinetic rates.\n- **Controls:** No meaningful controls are described for dissecting kinetics or background.\n- **Quantification:** \"Kinetics are inferred by comparing endpoint methylation fractions at the target from two independent cultures\" is scientifically invalid. This measures biological replicate variability, not reaction rates. Off-target analysis is limited to a small, arbitrary window. The measurement method, bisulfite sequencing, detects m$^5$C, not m$^6$A.\n- **Verdict:** This option is flawed in its choice of enzyme, strain, experimental duration, measurement technique, and analysis logic. It fails to meet any of the goals properly. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\n- **Methodology:** Proposes using catalytically *active* Cas$9$. This is a fundamental error, as it will cause DNA double-strand breaks, leading to a DNA damage response and cell death, confounding any epigenetic measurement. The goal is to write a mark, not cut the DNA. The fusion to a non-specific methyltransferase (M.EcoGII) would create a massive, un-interpretable background of methylation. The experiment is an endpoint measurement ($6$ hours), precluding kinetic analysis.\n- **Controls:** Not specified in sufficient detail.\n- **Quantification:** The use of DpnI digestion and gel electrophoresis is a low-resolution, qualitative method, not a quantitative, genome-wide technique like SMRT sequencing. It cannot yield per-site methylation fractions. The logic described (\"resist DpnI digestion\") is inverted; DpnI *cuts* methylated GATC sites, so resistance implies lack of methylation.\n- **Verdict:** This design is based on incorrect first principles (using active Cas$9$) and employs inadequate measurement techniques. It is entirely unsuitable. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\n- **Methodology:** Uses the correct dCas$9$-Dam tool in the `dam⁻ dcm⁻` strain. However, it relies on a single endpoint measurement after a $12$-hour continuous induction. This makes it impossible to measure rates and extract kinetic parameters. Long induction times can lead to saturation at the target site, masking differences in kinetic efficiency between on-target and off-target sites.\n- **Controls:** The control set is minimal (only a scrambled gRNA), which is insufficient for rigorous quantification of off-target effects or for dissecting the contributions of binding and catalysis.\n- **Quantification:** The definition of kinetic specificity as the \"endpoint on-target methylation fraction\" is fundamentally incorrect. An endpoint value is a cumulative result, not a rate. It conflates binding affinity, catalytic rate, and time into a single, un-interpretable number.\n- **Verdict:** While using the correct molecular tool, this design fails due to its endpoint nature, which makes it impossible to achieve the third and most complex goal of the problem: quantifying kinetics. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOnly Option A proposes an experimental design that is fit for purpose. It correctly combines a time-course experiment, appropriate molecular tools and controls, state-of-the-art measurement techniques, and a rigorous quantitative framework to successfully achieve all stated objectives, in particular the challenging task of separating binding and catalytic contributions to specificity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2490552"}, {"introduction": "The central tenet of epigenetics is the inheritance of traits without changes to the DNA sequence, but proving this non-genetic memory requires overcoming significant analytical challenges.

The experimental tools (microfluidics, fluorescent reporters) and the conceptual framework (epigenetic memory, Markov processes, HMMs) are standard and state-of-the-art in quantitative biology.

It clearly defines the biological system, the data, the formal hypotheses, and the analytical goals. It is well-posed, as it seeks the most appropriate method among choices, based on clear criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-defined, and provides all necessary information to evaluate the proposed strategies. We may proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem lies in disentangling true epigenetic inheritance from other sources of correlation between mother and daughter cells. From first principles:\n\n1.  **Central Dogma & Measurement:** The promoter state ($S_{i,t}$) is not directly observed. We observe protein fluorescence ($X_{i,t}$), which is a noisy, time-integrated reporter of promoter activity. This immediately suggests a hidden state model is required.\n2.  **Epigenetic Inheritance & Lineage:** The hypothesis concerns heritability, a process that occurs on the lineage tree. Any valid statistical method must explicitly use the mother-daughter relationships defined by the tree structure. Methods that average over cells or discard lineage information are fundamentally inappropriate.\n3.  **Confounding Variables:** Mother and daughter cells share more than just their epigenetic state. They share a local microenvironment, and properties like cell size, growth rate, and overall protein expression capacity (partially measured by $R_{i,t}$) are correlated between relatives. A failure to control for these confounders will lead to spurious correlations that could be mistaken for epigenetic memory. Therefore, it is essential to first regress out the effects of all measured covariates ($R_{i,t}$, size, growth, environmental factors like channel-by-time effects) from the primary signal $X_{i,t}$ to obtain a residual signal, $\\tilde{X}_{i,t}$, that is more purely related to the epigenetic state $S_{i,t}$.\n4.  **Statistical Model:** The combination of an unobserved, discrete state ($S_{i,t}$) evolving on a tree and a noisy, continuous observation ($\\tilde{X}_{i,t}$) is precisely the structure for which a **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** is designed. Since the process unfolds on a lineage tree, a variant of the standard HMM algorithm adapted for trees is necessary.\n5.  **Hypothesis Testing & Parameter Estimation:** The alternative hypothesis ($H_A$) corresponds to a full HMM where the state transition matrix allows for dependence of the daughter's state on the mother's. The null hypothesis ($H_0$) is a restricted version where the daughter's state is independent of the mother's. This corresponds to the two rows of the transition matrix being identical. The **Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT)** is a powerful and standard method for comparing such nested models. The persistence parameter is directly estimated as a parameter of the transition matrix in the HMM.\n6.  **Significance Assessment:** The null distribution of the LRT statistic for HMMs is not a standard $\\chi^2$ distribution. Therefore, its significance must be assessed using a simulation-based method. A **parametric bootstrap**, where one simulates data under the fitted null model while preserving the covariates and tree structure of the original experiment, provides a correctly calibrated null distribution for the test statistic.\n\nWith these principles established, we evaluate the options.\n\n**Option A:** Track many cells in the mother machine and pool all time points into a single time series per channel by averaging $X_{i,t}$ across cells at each time $t$. Fit an autoregressive model of order $1$ to the pooled series for $X$ and test whether the autoregressive coefficient is nonzero. If nonzero, declare non-genetic memory and estimate persistence from this coefficient. Use a standard $t$-test for significance.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:** This method is fundamentally flawed. By averaging across all cells at each time point, it completely discards the single-cell lineage structure, which is essential for testing a hypothesis about mother-to-daughter inheritance. The resulting time series correlation reflects population-level dynamics, not single-cell memory. Furthermore, it fails to properly control for confounding variables like $R_{i,t}$ and cell-specific properties.\n**Verdict for A:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option B:** Initialize a subset of lineages in the promoter ON state using a brief inducer pulse, then remove the inducer and maintain constant conditions. Track individual lineages for many generations, segment the lineage tree, and compute residual green fluorescence $\\tilde{X}_{i,t}$ by regressing $X_{i,t}$ on $R_{i,t}$, cell size, growth rate, and channel-by-time fixed effects to remove shared environmental and measurement variation. On the lineage tree, fit a two-state Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with transition matrix parameters $\\theta$ that include the mother-to-daughter persistence probability, and compute the maximum likelihood under the HMM versus a null model in which the daughter state is independent of the mother given covariates. Use a likelihood ratio statistic with a parametric bootstrap that simulates residuals and covariates along the observed tree under the null to obtain a calibrated $p$-value. Independently, estimate the correlation of $\\tilde{X}$ as a function of lineage generation distance $d$ and confirm that it follows the functional form implied by a two-state Markov process on the tree; infer the persistence parameter from the decay rate.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:** This strategy aligns perfectly with the principles derived above. It (1) correctly uses the lineage tree structure, (2) rigorously controls for all specified confounders by creating residuals, (3) employs the appropriate statistical model (HMM on a tree) for a hidden epigenetic state with noisy readouts, (4) uses a powerful hypothesis test (LRT) to compare well-defined null and alternative models, (5) correctly calibrates the test's significance using a parametric bootstrap, and (6) yields a directly interpretable persistence parameter from the HMM transition matrix. The independent correlation analysis provides an excellent confirmatory check. Initializing some cells in the ON state is a good experimental practice to ensure both states are well-sampled, increasing statistical power.\n**Verdict for B:** **Correct**.\n\n**Option C:** In the mother machine, collect single-cell data without any inducer. At the end of the experiment, compute the Pearson correlation between each mother’s $X$ and her daughter’s $X$ across all pairs, ignoring $R_{i,t}$ and covariates. Use a permutation test that randomly reassigns daughters to mothers across the entire dataset to generate a null distribution for the correlation and declare memory if the observed correlation exceeds the $95\\%$ quantile.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:** This approach is critically flawed because it explicitly states to ignore $R_{i,t}$ and other covariates. Any observed correlation could be an artifact of confounding factors (e.g., larger mothers having larger daughters, and size correlating with fluorescence) rather than true epigenetic memory. This failure to control for confounders makes any conclusion of \"memory\" unreliable and likely biased. While a permutation test can assess significance for a given statistic, it cannot fix the fact that the chosen statistic (raw correlation) is confounded.\n**Verdict for C:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D:** Hold cells in a chemostat without a microfluidic device to avoid confinement artifacts. Use a flow cytometer to measure $X$ and $R$ across the population at many time points and compute the cross-correlation between $X$ at time $t$ and $X$ at time $t+1$ for the entire population. If the cross-correlation is positive after regressing out $R$, conclude non-genetic memory and estimate persistence from the cross-correlation magnitude.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:** This option proposes an entirely different experiment that is unsuitable for the question at hand. Flow cytometry provides population snapshots and does not track individual cell lineages. Therefore, it is impossible to directly measure mother-to-daughter inheritance. The temporal correlation of population averages is a distinct and more complex phenomenon, influenced by growth rate differences and dilution, and is only an indirect proxy for single-cell memory. The problem explicitly provides data from a mother machine, which is the superior device for this question; abandoning it is illogical.\n**Verdict for D:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2490605"}]}
