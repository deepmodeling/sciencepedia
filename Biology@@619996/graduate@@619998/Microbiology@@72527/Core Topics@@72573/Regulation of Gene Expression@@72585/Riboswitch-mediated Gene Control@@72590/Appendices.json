The fractional occupancy $\\theta$ is the probability that a riboswitch is in the ligand-bound conformation. The overall regulatory output of the gene controlled by the riboswitch is a population-weighted average of the expression levels corresponding to the unbound and bound states.\n\nFor a repressing riboswitch, ligand binding reduces or abolishes gene expression (e.g., by forming a transcription terminator). The unbound state is \"ON,\" and the bound state is \"OFF.\" The overall expression level is proportional to $(1-\\theta)$, the fraction of riboswitches in the active, unbound state. As ligand concentration increases, $\\theta$ increases from $0$ to $1$, causing the expression level to decrease. A higher $\\theta$ therefore corresponds to stronger repression.\n\nFor an activating riboswitch, ligand binding promotes gene expression (e.g., by resolving a terminator stem into an anti-terminator). The unbound state is \"OFF,\" and the bound state is \"ON.\" The overall expression level is directly proportional to $\\theta$, the fraction of riboswitches in the active, bound state. As ligand concentration increases, $\\theta$ increases, causing the expression level to increase. A higher $\\theta$ therefore corresponds to stronger activation.\n\nIn both scenarios, $\\theta$ acts as the a transfer function that converts the input signal (ligand concentration) into the proportion of macromolecular switches that have changed state, which in turn dictates the magnitude of the downstream regulatory response.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.833}\n$$", "id": "2771122"}, {"introduction": "While fractional occupancy describes ligand binding, a complete model must also account for the riboswitch's structural dynamics, which often involves toggling between two mutually exclusive conformations like a terminator and an antiterminator.
