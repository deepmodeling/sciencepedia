The true $CI$ is a function of these parameters:\n$$CI = \\frac{\\mu_{M, \\mathrm{out}} / \\mu_{W, \\mathrm{out}}}{\\mu_{M, \\mathrm{in}} / \\mu_{W, \\mathrm{in}}}$$\nThe observed counts, denoted by the random variables $M_{\\mathrm{in}}, W_{\\mathrm{in}}, M_{\\mathrm{out}}, W_{\\mathrm{out}}$, are assumed to be realizations of independent Poisson processes. The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the mean $\\mu$ of a Poisson distribution is the observed count. By the invariance property of MLEs, the MLE of a function of parameters is the same function of the MLEs of those parameters.\nThus, the MLE for the competitive index, $\\widehat{CI}$, is found by substituting the observed counts for their respective true means:\n$$\\widehat{CI} = \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{out}} / W_{\\mathrm{out}}}{M_{\\mathrm{in}} / W_{\\mathrm{in}}} = \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{out}} \\cdot W_{\\mathrm{in}}}{W_{\\mathrm{out}} \\cdot M_{\\mathrm{in}}}$$\n\nPart 2: Derivation of $\\operatorname{Var}(\\ln \\widehat{CI})$\nTo find the variance of $\\widehat{CI}$, it is standard practice to first work with its natural logarithm, $\\ln \\widehat{CI}$, as its distribution is more symmetric and closer to Normal, especially for small counts.\n$$\\ln \\widehat{CI} = \\ln \\left( \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{out}} \\cdot W_{\\mathrm{in}}}{W_{\\mathrm{out}} \\cdot M_{\\mathrm{in}}} \\right) = \\ln(M_{\\mathrm{out}}) + \\ln(W_{\\mathrm{in}}) - \\ln(W_{\\mathrm{out}}) - \\ln(M_{\\mathrm{in}})$$\nSince the four counts $M_{\\mathrm{in}}, W_{\\mathrm{in}}, M_{\\mathrm{out}}, W_{\\mathrm{out}}$ are assumed to be independent random variables, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances. Note that $\\operatorname{Var}(-X) = (-1)^2 \\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\operatorname{Var}(X)$.\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(\\ln \\widehat{CI}) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\ln M_{\\mathrm{out}}) + \\operatorname{Var}(\\ln W_{\\mathrm{in}}) + \\operatorname{Var}(\\ln W_{\\mathrm{out}}) + \\operatorname{Var}(\\ln M_{\\mathrm{in}})$$\nWe now use the Delta method to approximate the variance of the logarithm of each count. For a random variable $X$ with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$, and for the function $g(X) = \\ln(X)$, the Delta method gives:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(g(X)) \\approx (g'(\\mu))^2 \\sigma^2$$\nHere, $g'(X) = \\frac{1}{X}$, so $g'(\\mu) = \\frac{1}{\\mu}$. For a Poisson variable, $\\sigma^2 = \\mu$. Substituting these into the Delta method formula:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(\\ln X) \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu}\\right)^2 \\mu = \\frac{1}{\\mu}$$\nTo get an estimate of this variance from the data, we substitute the observed count $X$ for the unknown mean $\\mu$. Applying this approximation to each of the four independent counts:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(\\ln M_{\\mathrm{out}}) \\approx \\frac{1}{M_{\\mathrm{out}}}, \\quad \\operatorname{Var}(\\ln W_{\\mathrm{in}}) \\approx \\frac{1}{W_{\\mathrm{in}}}, \\quad \\operatorname{Var}(\\ln W_{\\mathrm{out}}) \\approx \\frac{1}{W_{\\mathrm{out}}}, \\quad \\operatorname{Var}(\\ln M_{\\mathrm{in}}) \\approx \\frac{1}{M_{\\mathrm{in}}}$$\nSumming these terms gives the final expression for the approximate variance of $\\ln \\widehat{CI}$:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(\\ln \\widehat{CI}) \\approx \\frac{1}{M_{\\mathrm{in}}} + \\frac{1}{W_{\\mathrm{in}}} + \\frac{1}{M_{\\mathrm{out}}} + \\frac{1}{W_{\\mathrm{out}}}$$\n\nPart 3: Form of the $0.95$ Confidence Interval for $\\ln CI$\nAssuming that $\\ln \\widehat{CI}$ is approximately normally distributed, a two-sided $(1 - \\alpha)$ confidence interval for the true mean $\\ln CI$ is given by:\n$$ \\ln \\widehat{CI} \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\mathrm{SE}(\\ln \\widehat{CI})$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{SE}(\\ln \\widehat{CI}) = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(\\ln \\widehat{CI})}$ is the standard error, and $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the critical value from the standard Normal distribution.
