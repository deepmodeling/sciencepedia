This exercise allows you to apply fundamental principles of chemical kinetics to a two-dimensional membrane environment to quantify receptor occupancy and evaluate the \"dwell-time\" hypothesis for productive signaling. By working through this problem, you will gain a quantitative appreciation for how the biophysical parameters of the TCR-pMHC interaction, such as the on-rate ($k_{\\text{on}}$) and off-rate ($k_{\\text{off}}$), dictate the initiation of an immune response [@problem_id:2536740].", "problem": "A T cell receptor (TCR) engages peptide–Major Histocompatibility Complex (pMHC) ligands across a cell–cell contact interface where both TCRs and pMHCs are confined to a two-dimensional membrane.

All intermediate reasoning must be based on first principles as stated.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is based on established principles of receptor-ligand binding kinetics and kinetic proofreading models in immunology. All necessary parameters are provided, and the problem is free of contradictions or ambiguities. Therefore, a rigorous solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two quantities: the steady-state occupancy of a T cell receptor (TCR), denoted $x^{\\ast}$, and a binary indicator, $I$, which reflects whether a condition for T cell activation is met.\n\nFirst, we will derive the expression for the steady-state occupancy $x^{\\ast}$. The binding process is modeled as a reversible reaction $R + L \\rightleftharpoons C$, where $R$ is the free receptor, $L$ is the ligand, and $C$ is the receptor-ligand complex. The variable $x(t)$ represents the probability that a single receptor is in the bound state, $C$, at time $t$. Consequently, the probability of the receptor being in the free state, $R$, is $1 - x(t)$.\n\nThe rate of change of the bound probability, $\\frac{dx}{dt}$, is governed by the law of mass action. The transition from the unbound to the bound state is the forward reaction. Under pseudo-first-order conditions, the ligand density $\\rho_{L}$ is assumed to be constant. The rate of this transition for a single receptor is the product of the probability of being unbound, $1-x$, and the effective first-order association rate, which is $k_{\\text{on}} \\rho_{L}$. Thus, the rate of increase of $x$ is $(1-x) k_{\\text{on}} \\rho_{L}$.\n\nThe transition from the bound to the unbound state is the dissociation, or reverse reaction. This is a first-order process with rate constant $k_{\\text{off}}$. The rate of this transition is the product of the probability of being bound, $x$, and the rate constant $k_{\\text{off}}$. Thus, the rate of decrease of $x$ is $x k_{\\text{off}}$.\n\nCombining these two processes, we obtain the governing ordinary differential equation for the occupancy $x(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (1-x) k_{\\text{on}} \\rho_{L} - x k_{\\text{off}} $$\nAt steady state, the system is in equilibrium, meaning the net rate of change is zero, $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$. Let $x^{\\ast}$ be the occupancy at steady state. The equation becomes:\n$$ 0 = (1 - x^{\\ast}) k_{\\text{on}} \\rho_{L} - x^{\\ast} k_{\\text{off}} $$\nWe proceed to solve this algebraic equation for $x^{\\ast}$:\n$$ x^{\\ast} k_{\\text{off}} = k_{\\text{on}} \\rho_{L} - x^{\\ast} k_{\\text{on}} \\rho_{L} $$\n$$ x^{\\ast} (k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{on}} \\rho_{L}) = k_{\\text{on}} \\rho_{L} $$\n$$ x^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_{\\text{on}} \\rho_{L}}{k_{\\text{on}} \\rho_{L} + k_{\\text{off}}} $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $k_{\\text{on}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mu\\text{m}^{2}/(\\text{molecule}\\cdot \\text{s})$, $\\rho_{L} = 50\\ \\text{molecules}/\\mu\\text{m}^{2}$, and $k_{\\text{off}} = 0.80\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the effective association rate, $k_{\\text{on}} \\rho_{L}$:\n$$ k_{\\text{on}} \\rho_{L} = (4.0 \\times 10^{-3}) \\cdot 50 = 0.20\\ \\text{s}^{-1} $$\nNext, we substitute this value into the expression for $x^{\\ast}$:\n$$ x^{\\ast} = \\frac{0.20\\ \\text{s}^{-1}}{0.20\\ \\text{s}^{-1} + 0.80\\ \\text{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.20}{1.00} = 0.20 $$\nThe problem requires this result to be reported to four significant figures. Thus, $x^{\\ast} = 0.2000$.\n\nSecond, we must evaluate the activation condition, $\\tau_{\\text{dwell}} > \\tau_{\\ast}$, to determine the value of the indicator $I$. We are given the definitions for the mean dwell time, $\\tau_{\\text{dwell}}$, and the minimal signaling time, $\\tau_{\\ast}$:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{dwell}} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{off}}} $$\n$$ \\tau_{\\ast} = \\frac{L}{k_{p}} $$\nThe parameters provided for this calculation are $k_{\\text{off}} = 0.80\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$, $L = 3$, and $k_{p} = 2.0\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n\nWe calculate $\\tau_{\\text{dwell}}$:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{dwell}} = \\frac{1}{0.80\\ \\text{s}^{-1}} = 1.25\\ \\text{s} $$\nWe calculate $\\tau_{\\ast}$:\n$$ \\tau_{\\ast} = \\frac{3}{2.0\\ \\text{s}^{-1}} = 1.5\\ \\text{s} $$\nNow, we test the activation condition by comparing these two values:\n$$ 1.25\\ \\text{s} > 1.5\\ \\text{s} $$\nThis inequality is demonstrably false. Therefore, the condition for activation is not met. According to the problem definition, if the condition is not met, the indicator variable $I$ must be set to $0$.\n\nThe final result is a two-entry row vector $[x^{\\ast}, I]$, composed of the values we have determined.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.2000 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2536740"}, {"introduction": "Once a T cell receptor is engaged, a cascade of intracellular signaling events is unleashed, orchestrated by a series of kinases and scaffold proteins.

The ZAP-70 K369R mutant is a standard tool for dissecting the scaffolding versus catalytic functions of ZAP-70. The signaling cascade (Lck $\\rightarrow$ ZAP-70 $\\rightarrow$ LAT) and the downstream readouts are all fundamental and well-established concepts in the field.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The experimental setup is clearly defined, with controlled variables (matched protein expression) and specific boundary conditions (normal Lck, intact SH2 domains). The question asks for a prediction based on these conditions, which allows for a unique, logical solution derived from first principles.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem uses precise, technical language with no subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\nThe problem statement has no identifiable flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, incomplete, contradictory, or otherwise invalid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\n\nThe initiation of T cell signaling upon TCR engagement follows a well-defined sequence of events. We will analyze this pathway step-by-step to predict the outcome in the presence of the kinase-dead ZAP-70 K369R mutant.\n\n1.  **TCR Ligation and Lck Activation**: Binding of pMHC to the TCR leads to the formation of TCR microclusters. This spatial reorganization facilitates the activation of the Src family kinase Lck, which is associated with the T cell co-receptors (CD4 or CD8). As per the problem statement, Lck activity is normal.\n2.  **ITAM Phosphorylation**: Activated Lck phosphorylates the tyrosine residues within the ITAMs of the CD3$\\zeta$ chains associated with the TCR. This creates docking sites for downstream signaling proteins.\n3.  **ZAP-70 Recruitment**: The tandem SH2 domains of ZAP-70 bind with high affinity to the doubly phosphorylated ITAMs. The problem explicitly states that SH2 domain-mediated recruitment is intact for both the wild-type and the K369R mutant. Therefore, the kinase-dead ZAP-70 will be successfully recruited to the TCR complex.\n4.  **ZAP-70 Phosphorylation by Lck**: Upon recruitment to the TCR, ZAP-70 is itself a substrate for Lck. Lck phosphorylates ZAP-70 at several sites, including the key interdomain tyrosine Y319. This phosphorylation event is executed by Lck and is independent of ZAP-70's own catalytic activity. Consequently, we predict that ZAP-70 K369R will be phosphorylated at Y319.\n5.  **ZAP-70 Catalytic Activity and Substrate Phosphorylation**: This is the critical step where the kinase-dead mutant diverges. The K369R mutation resides in the catalytic domain and ablates the ability of ZAP-70 to function as a kinase. A fully active wild-type ZAP-70 would proceed to phosphorylate its primary substrates, the scaffold proteins LAT and SLP-76. The kinase-dead ZAP-70 K369R cannot perform this function.\n6.  **LAT Signalosome Assembly**: The phosphorylation of multiple tyrosines on LAT (such as Y132 and Y191) by ZAP-70 is the central event for the assembly of the \"LAT signalosome\". Since the kinase-dead ZAP-70 fails to phosphorylate LAT, these docking sites will not be created. As a result, adapter proteins like Grb2, Gads, and the enzyme PLC-$\\gamma$1 will not be recruited to LAT. The entire signalosome assembly will be abrogated.\n7.  **Downstream Signaling Pathways**:\n    - **PLC-$\\gamma$1 Pathway**: The recruitment and subsequent activation of PLC-$\\gamma$1 depend on the LAT scaffold. Without a phosphorylated LAT, PLC-$\\gamma$1 will not be localized to the membrane and activated. Therefore, phosphorylation of PLC-$\\gamma$1 at Y783 will not occur. This prevents the cleavage of $PIP_2$ into $IP_3$ and DAG, and as a direct consequence, the $IP_3$-mediated flux of cytosolic free $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ will be abolished.\n    - **Ras-ERK Pathway**: The recruitment of the Grb2-Sos complex to phosphorylated LAT is required to activate Ras. Without LAT phosphorylation, this pathway is blocked at its inception, leading to a marked diminishment or complete abrogation of downstream ERK 1/2 activation.\n    - **Actin and Integrin Regulation**: The LAT-Gads-SLP-76 complex is essential for activating downstream regulators of the actin cytoskeleton (e.g., Vav, Nck) and for mediating inside-out signaling to integrins like LFA-1. The initial adhesion mediated by LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1 on the bilayer will permit initial cell spreading. However, the failure to assemble the LAT signalosome prevents the inside-out signaling required for integrin affinity maturation and blocks the signals for sustained, organized actin remodeling. The result is a failure to form a stable immunological synapse.\n\nIn summary, the ZAP-70 K369R mutant acts as a dominant-negative protein. It is recruited to the TCR but fails to propagate the signal, effectively blocking all major downstream pathways originating from the LAT scaffold. Upstream events (ITAM phosphorylation, ZAP-70 recruitment, and phosphorylation of ZAP-70 by Lck) remain intact.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. CD3$\\zeta$ ITAM phosphorylation and ZAP-70 recruitment and phosphorylation at Y319 proceed, and TCR microclusters form, but LAT tyrosines are poorly phosphorylated, preventing stable LAT signalosome assembly; PLC-$\\gamma$1 activation and downstream $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ influx are abrogated, ERK 1/2 activation is markedly diminished, and initial spreading occurs but integrin affinity maturation and sustained actin remodeling are reduced.**\nThis statement perfectly matches the step-by-step derivation from first principles. It correctly identifies that events upstream of ZAP-70 catalysis (ITAM phosphorylation, ZAP-70 recruitment, ZAP-70 phosphorylation by Lck) are intact. It correctly pinpoints the primary defect: the failure to phosphorylate LAT. It then accurately describes the downstream consequences: failure of signalosome assembly, abrogation of PLC-$\\gamma$1/$\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ signaling, diminishment of ERK activation, and defective integrin/actin responses.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Because ZAP-70 kinase activity is required to recruit Lck, CD3$\\zeta$ ITAMs fail to be phosphorylated; therefore ZAP-70 does not bind the TCR, LAT is not phosphorylated, microclusters do not form, and all downstream pathways are completely absent.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed in its premise. The causality is inverted. Lck is active *before* and *independently* of ZAP-70 activity; in fact, Lck activity is required to create the docking sites *for* ZAP-70. Lck is not recruited by ZAP-70. Therefore, ITAMs will be phosphorylated, and ZAP-70 will bind the TCR.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Redundant Lck activity preserves LAT phosphorylation despite the lack of ZAP-70 catalytic function; thus PLC-$\\gamma$1 and $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ responses are near normal, but the Ras–ERK pathway is selectively impaired due to its unique dependence on ZAP-70 kinase activity.**\nThis statement incorrectly overstates the role of Lck in LAT phosphorylation. While Lck may have some minor capacity to phosphorylate LAT, ZAP-70 is the principal and essential kinase for this step. LAT phosphorylation would be severely impaired, not preserved. Consequently, all pathways downstream of LAT, including both the PLC-$\\gamma$1/$\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ and Ras-ERK pathways, would be crippled. There is no selective impairment; both branches are dependent on the LAT scaffold.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Loss of ZAP-70 catalytic activity relieves negative feedback on LAT, causing enhanced LAT phosphorylation, hyperactivation of PLC-$\\gamma$1, and exaggerated $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ flux despite the kinase-dead mutation.**\nThis statement proposes a mechanism that is the opposite of ZAP-70's established function. ZAP-70 kinase activity is the primary positive-acting signal for LAT phosphorylation. Its loss leads to a loss of signal, not an enhancement through relief of some hypothetical negative feedback. The predicted outcome of hyperactivation is contrary to established experimental findings.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. LAT phosphorylation is supported, but SLP-76 recruitment fails because SLP-76 binds ZAP-70 rather than LAT; therefore PLC-$\\gamma$1 activation and $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ flux proceed, but cytoskeletal remodeling is selectively impaired.**\nThis statement contains multiple errors. First, LAT phosphorylation is *not* supported, as it requires ZAP-70 kinase activity. Second, the mechanism of SLP-76 recruitment is misrepresented. The canonical pathway involves SLP-76 binding to the adapter Gads, which in turn binds to phosphorylated LAT. The assembly of the LAT-Gads-SLP-76 trimolecular complex is a cornerstone of the signalosome. Because LAT phosphorylation fails, this entire complex fails to form, impacting all its downstream functions, not just cytoskeletal remodeling.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2536717"}, {"introduction": "A T cell's fate—whether it becomes a short-lived effector or a long-lived memory cell—is profoundly influenced by its metabolic state during activation.

It is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and contains all necessary information for a rigorous solution. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution is derived by systematically applying the provided foundational facts to the experimental conditions.\n\n**1. Primary Effect of the Perturbation:**\nThe cells are treated with an AMPK agonist. According to Foundational Fact (i), AMPK activation serves two primary functions relevant here: it constrains mTORC1 activity and it promotes FAO and mitochondrial biogenesis. The problem statement confirms this is occurring, noting reduced phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate S6 and increased palmitate oxidation (FAO).\n\n**2. Metabolic Consequences:**\n-   **Promotion of Catabolism:** AMPK activation directly enhances FAO. This necessitates increased activity of enzymes in this pathway, such as Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), the rate-limiting enzyme for fatty acid import into mitochondria (Fact iii). The promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis by AMPK would lead to increased mitochondrial mass and function, manifesting as an increased Spare Respiratory Capacity (SRC). PGC-1$\\alpha$ is a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, and its signaling is known to be induced by AMPK. Furthermore, AMPK is a key initiator of autophagy, a catabolic process for cellular recycling.\n-   **Suppression of Anabolism & Glycolysis:** The constraint of mTORC1 has direct downstream consequences. According to Fact (ii), mTORC1 promotes glycolysis. Therefore, inhibiting mTORC1 (as confirmed by decreased phospho-S6) will suppress glycolysis. This will lead to decreased expression of the glucose transporter Glut1 and reduced conversion of pyruvate to lactate, resulting in decreased lactate efflux.\n\n**3. Linking Metabolism to T Cell Differentiation:**\nThe predicted metabolic profile is a state of **low glycolysis** and **high FAO/oxidative phosphorylation**. We compare this profile to the definitions of memory and effector cells.\n-   Fact (iii) states that memory precursor cells preferentially rely on FAO, have increased SRC, and higher CPT1A. This is a direct match to the metabolic state induced by the AMPK agonist.\n-   Fact (iv) states that effector cells are characterized by high glycolytic flux. This is the opposite of the induced state.\nTherefore, treatment with an AMPK agonist biases differentiation toward the **memory precursor T cell lineage**.\n\n**4. Predicting the Full Phenotype:**\nBased on the conclusion that the cells are differentiating into memory precursors, we use Fact (iii) to predict the complete molecular and cellular profile:\n-   **Surface Phenotype:** $\\mathrm{CD127^{hi}KLRG1^{lo}}$.\n-   **Key Transcription Factors:** Increased TCF-1 and Eomes; decreased Blimp-1 and restrained T-bet.\n-   **Cytokine Response:** Enhanced responsiveness to homeostatic cytokines like IL-15 and, consequently, reduced dependence on the primary proliferative cytokine for effectors, Interleukin-2 (IL-2).\n\n**5. Identifying the Attenuating Perturbation:**\nThe bias toward memory formation is driven by the enhanced FAO pathway. To blunt or attenuate this bias, the most direct intervention is to inhibit this specific metabolic pathway. The rate-limiting step of long-chain FAO is the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria, catalyzed by Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1). Therefore, a pharmacologic inhibitor of CPT1 would block the metabolic reprogramming driven by AMPK and thus attenuate the bias toward memory cell differentiation.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $\\mathrm{CD127^{hi}KLRG1^{lo}}$ with increased TCF-1, increased Eomes, decreased Blimp-1, restrained T-bet, decreased Glut1, decreased lactate efflux, decreased phospho-S6, increased CPT1A, increased palmitate oxidation, increased SRC, increased Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1$\\alpha$ (PGC-1$\\alpha$) signaling, increased autophagy; enhanced responsiveness to IL-15 with reduced dependence on Interleukin-2 (IL-2); this bias is attenuated by pharmacologic inhibition of CPT1.**\nThis option presents a profile that is fully consistent with the derived consequences of AMPK activation. It correctly identifies the memory phenotype ($\\mathrm{CD127^{hi}KLRG1^{lo}}$), the associated transcription factor program (high TCF-1/Eomes, low Blimp-1), the metabolic state (suppressed glycolysis, enhanced FAO/mitochondrial function), the upstream signaling event (decreased phospho-S6), and the correct cytokine response profile. Crucially, it identifies inhibition of CPT1 as the logical method to attenuate this FAO-dependent differentiation bias.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $\\mathrm{CD127^{lo}KLRG1^{hi}}$ with increased T-bet, increased Blimp-1, decreased Eomes, increased HIF-1$\\alpha$, increased c-Myc, increased Glut1, increased lactate efflux, increased phospho-S6; decreased CPT1A, decreased palmitate oxidation, decreased SRC; enhanced responsiveness to IL-2; this bias is reversed by rapamycin.**\nThis option describes the effector T cell phenotype, which is the opposite of what is expected. It claims increased phospho-S6, which contradicts the known inhibitory effect of AMPK on mTORC1. It suggests the bias is reversed by rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor. Since AMPK agonism also inhibits mTORC1, rapamycin would promote, not reverse, the memory-biased differentiation program. The statement is fundamentally flawed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $\\mathrm{CD127^{hi}KLRG1^{lo}}$ with increased TCF-1 but concurrently increased phospho-S6, increased Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein 1 (SREBP-1) activity, increased Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase activity, and increased de novo lipogenesis with decreased CPT1A; increased lactate efflux; enhanced responsiveness to IL-2 over IL-15; this bias is attenuated by fatty acid synthase inhibition.**\nThis option contains numerous internal contradictions. While it correctly identifies the memory cell surface markers, it erroneously claims increased phospho-S6 (mTORC1 activation) and its anabolic consequences (de novo lipogenesis). AMPK activation inhibits these processes. It also incorrectly states decreased CPT1A and increased lactate efflux. The entire metabolic description is the antithesis of the effects of AMPK activation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Minimal change in surface phenotype with unchanged CD127 and KLRG1, but increased mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2 (mTORC2) signaling and AKT Serine-473 phosphorylation that increases glycolysis and reduces mitochondrial mass; unchanged palmitate oxidation and SRC; responsiveness to IL-2 is maintained; this bias is attenuated by 2-deoxyglucose.**\nThis option is incorrect on multiple grounds. It claims \"unchanged palmitate oxidation,\" which directly contradicts the problem's own experimental data. It incorrectly claims that AMPK agonism increases glycolysis and reduces mitochondrial mass; in fact, it does the opposite. The invocation of mTORC2 is a distraction from the primary, established AMPK-mTORC1 axis central to this problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2536789"}]}
