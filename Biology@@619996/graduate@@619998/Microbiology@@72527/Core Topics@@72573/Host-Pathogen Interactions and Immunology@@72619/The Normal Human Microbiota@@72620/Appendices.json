It utilizes standard concepts from microbial ecology (16S rRNA profiling, bacterial guilds, functional redundancy) and information theory (Shannon diversity, Hill numbers). The data and biological context are realistic.\n- The problem is well-posed. The input data is a vector of relative abundances, and the desired outputs are well-defined mathematical functions of this vector.\n- The problem is self-contained and consistent. An essential check is that the relative abundances sum to unity, confirming the \"exhaustive partition\" claim. The sum is $0.35 + 0.08 + 0.12 + 0.10 + 0.07 + 0.06 + 0.04 + 0.18 = 1.00$. This condition is satisfied. The problem is free of contradictions.\n- The problem uses precise, objective language and requires no subjective interpretation to compute the primary quantities.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe first quantity to be computed is the Shannon diversity index, $H$. This index measures the uncertainty (entropy) in predicting the identity of an individual randomly selected from the community. Its definition, using the natural logarithm as specified, is:\n$$H = - \\sum_{i=1}^{S} p_i \\ln(p_i)$$\nwhere $S$ is the number of guilds (richness) and $p_i$ is the relative abundance of the $i$-th guild. Here, $S=8$ and the values of $p_i$ are given by the vector $\\vec{p}$.\n\nSubstituting the given abundances:\n$$H = - \\big[ 0.35 \\ln(0.35) + 0.08 \\ln(0.08) + 0.12 \\ln(0.12) + 0.10 \\ln(0.10) + 0.07 \\ln(0.07) + 0.06 \\ln(0.06) + 0.04 \\ln(0.04) + 0.18 \\ln(0.18) \\big]$$\nThe individual terms are calculated:\n$0.35 \\ln(0.35) \\approx -0.367437$\n$0.08 \\ln(0.08) \\approx -0.202058$\n$0.12 \\ln(0.12) \\approx -0.254431$\n$0.10 \\ln(0.10) \\approx -0.230259$\n$0.07 \\ln(0.07) \\approx -0.186148$\n$0.06 \\ln(0.06) \\approx -0.168805$\n$0.04 \\ln(0.04) \\approx -0.128755$\n$0.18 \\ln(0.18) \\approx -0.308664$\n\nThe sum of these terms is approximately $-1.846557$. Therefore, the Shannon index is:\n$$H = -(-1.846557) \\approx 1.846557$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $H \\approx 1.847$.\n\nThe second quantity is the effective number of species, which corresponds to the Hill number of order $q=1$, denoted $^1D$. The general formula for Hill numbers is $^qD = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{S} p_i^q \\right)^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}$. For the special case of $q=1$, the Hill number is defined as the limit as $q \\to 1$, which is the exponential of the Shannon index:\n$$^1D = \\exp(H)$$\nThis quantity, also known as \"true diversity\", converts the Shannon index back to an intuitive unit of an \"equivalent number of equally abundant species\". Using the unrounded value of $H$ for precision:\n$$^1D = \\exp(1.846557) \\approx 6.33758$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $^1D \\approx 6.338$.\n\nFinally, the interpretation of these values in the context of functional redundancy is required. The Shannon index $H \\approx 1.847$ and corresponding effective number of species $^1D \\approx 6.338$ indicate a relatively high diversity. The community consists of $S=8$ guilds but is as diverse as a community with approximately $6.34$ equally abundant guilds. This implies moderate evenness.\n\nTo assess functional redundancy, we map key functions to the guilds:\n1.  **SCFA production**: This function is distributed across multiple guilds. Specifically, butyrate, a key SCFA, is produced by *Faecalibacterium*-like ($p_3=0.12$), *Roseburia*-like ($p_5=0.07$), and *Blautia*-like ($p_6=0.06$) guilds. The total relative abundance dedicated to this function is substantial, at $0.12 + 0.07 + 0.06 = 0.25$. The distribution of this single function across three distinct guilds implies high functional redundancy. The loss of one of these guilds could be compensated for by the others, preserving the overall functional capacity.\n2.  **Mucin degradation**: This function is explicitly assigned to a single guild, *Akkermansia*-like mucin degraders, which is present at a low relative abundance of $p_7=0.04$. The concentration of this critical function into a single, low-abundance guild implies low functional redundancy. A decline in this specific population would likely lead to a direct and significant impairment of mucin degradation, as no other guild is listed as a primary performer of this role.\n\nIn conclusion, although the overall community diversity is high ($^1D/S = 6.338/8 \\approx 0.79$), the functional organization is not uniform. The system exhibits high redundancy for SCFA production but is fragile with respect to mucin degradation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.847 & 6.338\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2538719"}, {"introduction": "Beyond describing which microbes are present, a central challenge in microbiology is to predict their collective metabolic function.

Use logistic constraints on biomass growth and Monod dependence on lactate for *Eubacterium hallii*:\n- $g_B = \\mu_B \\left(1 - \\dfrac{X_B}{K_B}\\right) X_B$,\n- $g_H = \\mu_H \\dfrac{L}{K_L + L} \\left(1 - \\dfrac{X_H}{K_H}\\right) X_H$.\n\nLet lactate production by *Bifidobacterium* be proportional to its biomass formation ($y_{L|B} g_B$), and lactate consumption by *Eubacterium hallii* be proportional to its biomass formation with yield $Y_{X|L}$, so that lactate consumption rate is $\\dfrac{1}{Y_{X|L}} g_H$. Butyrate production is proportional to lactate consumption with yield $y_{B_u|L}$. Include first-order death for both populations and first-order removal for both metabolites. The resulting system is:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dfrac{dX_B}{dt} &= g_B - d_B X_B, \\\\\n\\dfrac{dX_H}{dt} &= g_H - d_H X_H, \\\\\n\\dfrac{dL}{dt} &= y_{L|B} g_B - \\dfrac{1}{Y_{X|L}} g_H - k_{\\mathrm{out}} L, \\\\\n\\dfrac{dB_u}{dt} &= y_{B_u|L} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{Y_{X|L}} g_H\\right) - k_{\\mathrm{out}} B_u.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nInitial conditions at $t = 0$:\n- $X_B(0) = X_{B,0}$ ($\\text{g/L}$),\n- $X_H(0) = X_{H,0}$ ($\\text{g/L}$),\n- $L(0) = L_0$ (mM),\n- $B_u(0) = B_{u,0}$ (mM).\n\nStability criterion to lactate accumulation. A test case is deemed stable if and only if the final-time lactate is below threshold:\n$$\n\\text{stable} \\iff L(T_{\\max}) \\le L_{\\mathrm{thr}}.\n$$\nReport the decision as a Boolean for each test case. No angles are involved. All rates are per hour, all concentrations in millimolar, and all biomasses in grams per liter.\n\nImplementation requirements:\n- Numerically integrate the system from $t = 0$ to $t = T_{\\max}$ using any suitable explicit method with adaptive step size (for example, Runge–Kutta of order $4$ or $5$). Ensure non-negativity in rate evaluations by using $\\max$ with $0$ for state variables used inside the rate laws.\n- Use the parameter sets given below without modification.\n- Express the final decisions as a Python list literal string on a single line, e.g., $[\\text{True},\\text{False},\\dots]$.\n\nFixed parameters common to all test cases unless otherwise specified:\n- $K_B = 2.0 \\text{ g/L}$,\n- $K_H = 1.5 \\text{ g/L}$,\n- $d_B = 0.05 \\text{ h}^{-1}$,\n- $d_H = 0.05 \\text{ h}^{-1}$,\n- $k_{\\mathrm{out}} = 0.05 \\text{ h}^{-1}$,\n- $Y_{X|L} = 0.05 \\text{ g/mM}$,\n- $y_{B_u|L} = 0.5 \\text{ mM/mM}$,\n- $T_{\\max} = 200.0 \\text{ h}$,\n- $L_{\\mathrm{thr}} = 10.0 \\text{ mM}$.\n\nTest suite.

These are standard in mathematical ecology and systems biology. The model describes a plausible cross-feeding interaction within the gut microbiota. It is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is an initial value problem (IVP) for a system of ordinary differential equations. The rate functions are continuous and locally Lipschitz, which guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a solution for a given set of initial conditions and parameters. The task is to find the state at a specific time $T_{\\max}$ and apply a clear decision criterion. The problem is well-posed.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise mathematical and quantitative terms. All parameters, variables, and criteria are defined objectively. There is no subjective language.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: All necessary parameters and initial conditions are provided for each test case. The units are consistent. There are no contradictions.\n5.  **Feasibility**: The parameter values are within biologically plausible ranges for microbial metabolism and growth. The simulation is computationally feasible.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**.
