The fundamental principle governing this calculation is the multiplication rule of counting. This rule states that if a procedure can be broken down into a sequence of independent stages, the total number of composite outcomes is the product of the number of outcomes at each stage.\n\nThe formation of a complete Ig heavy chain variable region exon, as described, involves four independent sources of diversity:\n1.

Consider standard selection principles: double-positive (DP) thymocytes survive only if TCR signals fall within a permissive window, bounded below by a lower signal requirement for positive selection and bounded above by a deletionary threshold for negative selection. Empirically supported models and measurements indicate that the instantaneous TCR signal is a monotone-increasing function of both the intrinsic TCR–peptide–MHC affinity and the density of presented peptide–MHC ligands. In the modified thymus, the self-peptide–MHC density is increased by a common multiplicative factor $k$ with $k>1$ for both MHC class I and class II.\n\nBased only on these premises, predict in the space of intrinsic TCR affinity for self peptide–MHC how the effective positive selection and negative selection thresholds shift when self-peptide density is increased, and describe the resulting qualitative change in the distribution of intrinsic self-reactivity among mature naive CD4 and CD8 T cells that exit the thymus (assume that the distributions are shaped by the window defined in the thymus and that peripheral selection does not differentially skew the outcome in this comparison).

This can be written as $S = f(A, D)$, where $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial A} > 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial D} > 0$.\n- Density change: The self-pMHC density is increased by a common multiplicative factor $k$ with $k > 1$ for both MHC class I and class II. Let the baseline density be $D_0$ and the modified density be $D_k = k \\cdot D_0$.\n- Question: Predict the shift in the effective positive and negative selection thresholds in the space of intrinsic TCR affinity ($A$) and the qualitative change in the resulting mature T cell repertoire.\n- Assumption: Peripheral selection does not alter the outcome.\n\n**Step 2: Validation of Problem Statement**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, rooted in the widely accepted signal strength model of thymic selection. It posits that the fate of a thymocyte—death by neglect, positive selection, or negative selection—is determined by the integrated strength of the signal it receives from self-pMHC complexes. The premise that signal strength is a function of both affinity and ligand density is a fundamental tenet of this model. The problem is well-posed, providing a clear perturbation ($D \\to k \\cdot D$ with $k>1$) and asking for the logical consequences on the selection window defined in terms of intrinsic affinity. The definitions are precise and objective, using standard immunological terminology. The setup is self-contained and free from internal contradictions or factual inaccuracies. The problem is therefore valid for analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the relationship $S = f(A, D)$. The signal thresholds for positive and negative selection, $S_{pos}$ and $S_{neg}$ respectively, are intrinsic properties of the thymocyte's signaling apparatus and are stated to be unchanged by the modification. Survival requires $S_{pos} \\le S \\le S_{neg}$.\n\nIn the baseline condition (wild-type), the pMHC density is $D_0$. The window of selected affinities, $[A_{pos, 0}, A_{neg, 0}]$, is defined by the following boundary conditions:\n1.  The minimum affinity for positive selection, $A_{pos, 0}$, satisfies $f(A_{pos, 0}, D_0) = S_{pos}$.\n2.  The minimum affinity for negative selection, $A_{neg, 0}$, satisfies $f(A_{neg, 0}, D_0) = S_{neg}$.\n\nIn the modified condition, the density is $D_k = k \\cdot D_0$, where $k > 1$. Let the new affinity thresholds be $A_{pos, k}$ and $A_{neg, k}$. These must satisfy the same signal threshold conditions but at the new density:\n1.  $f(A_{pos, k}, D_k) = f(A_{pos, k}, k \\cdot D_0) = S_{pos}$.\n2.  $f(A_{neg, k}, D_k) = f(A_{neg, k}, k \\cdot D_0) = S_{neg}$.\n\nBy equating the baseline and modified conditions for each threshold:\n- For positive selection: $f(A_{pos, k}, k \\cdot D_0) = f(A_{pos, 0}, D_0)$. Since $k > 1$, the density argument $k \\cdot D_0$ is greater than $D_0$. Because $f(A, D)$ is a monotone-increasing function with respect to both arguments, to maintain a constant function value while increasing the second argument ($D$), the first argument ($A$) must decrease. Therefore, $A_{pos, k} < A_{pos, 0}$.\n- For negative selection: $f(A_{neg, k}, k \\cdot D_0) = f(A_{neg, 0}, D_0)$. By the same logic, an increased density requires a decreased affinity to produce the same signal strength $S_{neg}$. Therefore, $A_{neg, k} < A_{neg, 0}$.\n\nConclusion 1: Both the effective positive selection and negative selection thresholds shift to a lower intrinsic affinity (a \"leftward\" shift in affinity space).\n\nNext, we analyze the width of the affinity window, which is $\\Delta A = A_{neg} - A_{pos}$. In the baseline, it is $\\Delta A_0 = A_{neg, 0} - A_{pos, 0}$. In the modified case, it is $\\Delta A_k = A_{neg, k} - A_{pos, k}$. Increasing the ligand density generally increases the sensitivity of the system, meaning a smaller change in affinity is required to achieve the same change in signal strength. Formally, the slope of the signal-affinity curve, $\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial A}$, increases with density $D$. To span the fixed signal range from $S_{pos}$ to $S_{neg}$, a smaller affinity range is thus required at higher density. Therefore, we predict that $\\Delta A_k < \\Delta A_0$. The window of permitted intrinsic affinities narrows.\n\nFinally, we consider the consequences for the mature T cell repertoire.\n- The entire selection window $[A_{pos, k}, A_{neg, k}]$ has shifted to lower values compared to the original window $[A_{pos, 0}, A_{neg, 0}]$. This implies that the resulting T cell repertoire will have a lower mean intrinsic affinity for self-pMHC; that is, a lower mean self-reactivity.\n- The highest-affinity clones that previously survived (those with affinities just below $A_{neg, 0}$) will now be deleted because their affinities are above the new, lower threshold $A_{neg, k}$. This constitutes a depletion of the upper, high-affinity tail of the self-reactive T cell distribution.\n- Clones with very low affinity (between $A_{pos, k}$ and $A_{pos, 0}$) that previously failed positive selection due to insufficient signal strength will now be successfully selected, as the increased ligand density compensates for their low affinity. This results in the inclusion of new, lower-affinity clones at the bottom end of the repertoire.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nA. **Both the effective positive selection and negative selection thresholds shift toward lower intrinsic affinity (leftward in affinity space), and the window of permitted intrinsic affinities narrows. Consequently, both CD4 and CD8 repertoires shift toward lower mean self-reactivity, with depletion of the upper (high-affinity) tail and modest inclusion of clones that previously failed positive selection.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with all points of the derivation. The shifts in thresholds, narrowing of the window, and resulting changes to the repertoire are all correctly described. **Correct**.\n\nB. **Both the effective positive selection and negative selection thresholds shift toward higher intrinsic affinity (rightward), and the window broadens. Consequently, both CD4 and CD8 repertoires shift toward higher mean self-reactivity with an expanded high-affinity tail.**\nThis is incorrect. The thresholds shift to lower, not higher, affinity. The window narrows, it does not broaden. The consequences are opposite to what is predicted by the model. **Incorrect**.\n\nC. **Only the negative selection threshold shifts toward lower intrinsic affinity, while the positive selection threshold is unchanged. Consequently, the upper (high-affinity) tail is pruned but low-affinity clones are unaffected, reducing variance without changing the mean of self-reactivity for CD4 and CD8.**\nThis is incorrect. The problem states that the increased pMHC density occurs in both the cortex (site of positive selection) and medulla (primary site of negative selection). Therefore, the signal for both processes is affected, and both affinity thresholds must shift. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. **The thresholds are invariant due to thymic homeostatic compensation, so the CD4 and CD8 intrinsic self-reactivity distributions are unchanged.**\nThis is incorrect. The problem provides a specific mechanistic model and does not include any premises about such homeostatic compensation. Based on the given rules, one cannot invoke mechanisms not described in the statement. The model explicitly predicts a shift in the affinity thresholds. **Incorrect**.\n\nE. **The positive selection threshold shifts toward lower intrinsic affinity while the negative selection threshold shifts toward higher intrinsic affinity, broadening the window. Consequently, both CD4 and CD8 repertoires become more diverse, with expansion of both low- and high-affinity clones.**\nThis is incorrect. The negative selection threshold also shifts to lower affinity, not higher. Increasing ligand density makes it easier to trigger the deletionary signal $S_{neg}$, which means the affinity required to do so, $A_{neg}$, must decrease.
