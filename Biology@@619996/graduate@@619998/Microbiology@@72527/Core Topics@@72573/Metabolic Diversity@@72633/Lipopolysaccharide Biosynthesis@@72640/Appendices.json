{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The synthesis of lipopolysaccharide begins with the intricate, multi-step construction of its membrane anchor, lipid A, via the Raetz pathway. To truly grasp this fundamental process, we must move beyond a simple diagram of reactions to a quantitative understanding of its resource demands. This practice challenges you to perform a detailed stoichiometric analysis, accounting for every molecule of ATP and UTP consumed in the assembly of the initial $Kdo_2$-lipid A structure [@problem_id:2504610]. By tracing the flow of energy and precursors, you will develop a rigorous, quantitative appreciation for the cellular investment required to build this essential component of the Gram-negative cell envelope.", "problem": "A lipopolysaccharide lipid A molecule in enteric bacteria is assembled by the Raetz pathway, beginning from uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and proceeding through a series of acyltransfer, deacetylation, glycosyltransfer, phosphorylation, and keto-deoxyoctulosonate (Kdo) transfer steps to produce $Kdo_2$-lipid A. Starting from the following well-established biochemical facts, derive the net stoichiometry of uridine triphosphate (UTP) consumption, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) consumption, and pyrophosphate ($PP_i$) release required to synthesize exactly one molecule of $Kdo_2$-lipid A. Your derivation must be based on first principles of enzyme mechanism and mass balance, not on any precompiled stoichiometry.\n\nUse only the following as your fundamental base:\n- Uridyltransferase (GlmU) converts N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate to UDP-GlcNAc using UTP and releases $PP_i$; glycosyl donors activated as UDP-sugars are formed via this reaction class. \n- The early Raetz enzymes LpxA and LpxD are acyltransferases that use acyl-acyl carrier protein (acyl-ACP) thioesters and do not consume ATP or UTP; LpxC is a deacetylase with no nucleotide hydrolysis; LpxH (or the functional equivalent LpxI/LpxG) hydrolyzes the pyrophosphate linkage of UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine to produce lipid X and uridine monophosphate (UMP), with no ATP or UTP consumption; LpxB is a glycosyltransferase that uses a UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine donor to form the disaccharide-1-phosphate and releases UMP, with no ATP or UTP consumption.\n- LpxK is an ATP-dependent kinase that phosphorylates the disaccharide-1-phosphate at the $4^{\\prime}$-position, hydrolyzing ATP to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate ($\\mathrm{P_i}$).\n- Kdo transferase (WaaA/KdtA) transfers exactly $2$ Kdo residues to the lipid A disaccharide backbone, using cytidine monophosphate-activated Kdo (CMP-Kdo) as the donor; CMP-Kdo is formed by CMP-Kdo synthetase (KdsB) from Kdo and cytidine triphosphate (CTP), releasing $PP_i$; Kdo transfer releases CMP, not $PP_i$.\n- Late acyltransferases (for example, LpxL and LpxM) use acyl-ACP donors and do not consume ATP or UTP.\n\nAssumptions and boundaries:\n- Count only direct UTP and ATP hydrolyses within the pathway and the formation of the requisite activated sugar nucleotides (UDP-GlcNAc and CMP-Kdo). Exclude the energetic costs of central carbon metabolism, amino sugar formation, fatty acid biosynthesis, and any salvage or recycling steps.\n- Exactly $2$ glucosamine units (each originating from UDP-GlcNAc) constitute the lipid A disaccharide backbone, and exactly $2$ Kdo residues are installed to obtain $Kdo_2$-lipid A.\n- Ignore any regulatory or accessory phosphorylation events beyond the single LpxK-catalyzed phosphorylation required to produce the diphosphoryl lipid A backbone prior to Kdo addition.\n\nTask: Derive the total counts of UTP molecules consumed, ATP molecules consumed, and $PP_i$ molecules released to produce exactly $1$ molecule of $Kdo_2$-lipid A. Express your final answer as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} \\text{UTP}  \\text{ATP}  PP_i \\end{pmatrix}$ using integers. No units. No rounding is necessary, and none should be performed.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the net stoichiometry for the consumption of uridine triphosphate ($UTP$) and adenosine triphosphate ($ATP$), and the release of pyrophosphate ($PP_{i}$), for the synthesis of one molecule of $Kdo_{2}$-lipid A from its precursors, following the Raetz pathway. The derivation will be performed by systematically analyzing the energetic costs associated with the assembly of the constituent parts of the target molecule, based on the provided enzymatic reaction data.\n\nFirst, we must deconstruct the final molecule, $Kdo_{2}$-lipid A, into its fundamental building blocks as specified by the problem. It consists of a diglucosamine backbone, which is phosphorylated, and to which two keto-deoxyoctulosonate ($Kdo$) residues are attached. We will account for the nucleotide and pyrophosphate budget for each stage of assembly.\n\n1.  **Synthesis of the Diglucosamine Backbone Precursors**\n    The lipid A disaccharide backbone is composed of two glucosamine units. The problem states that each of these units originates from uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine ($UDP-GlcNAc$). Therefore, the synthesis of one molecule of the disaccharide requires two molecules of $UDP-GlcNAc$.\n    The formation of $UDP-GlcNAc$ is catalyzed by the uridyltransferase $GlmU$ according to the reaction:\n    $$N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate + UTP \\rightarrow UDP-GlcNAc + PP_{i}$$\n    For each molecule of $UDP-GlcNAc$ synthesized, one molecule of $UTP$ is consumed and one molecule of $PP_{i}$ is released. To provide the two glucosamine units for the lipid A backbone, this reaction must occur twice.\n    The costs for this stage are therefore:\n    - $UTP$ consumed: $2 \\times 1 = 2$\n    - $ATP$ consumed: $0$\n    - $PP_{i}$ released: $2 \\times 1 = 2$\n\n    The subsequent enzymatic steps in the early Raetz pathway ($LpxA$, $LpxC$, $LpxD$, $LpxH$, $LpxB$) are responsible for acylating, deacetylating, and joining the two glucosamine units. The problem explicitly states that $LpxA$, $LpxC$, and $LpxD$ do not consume $ATP$ or $UTP$. The enzymes $LpxH$ and $LpxB$ mediate the release of the uridine nucleotide carrier as uridine monophosphate ($UMP$), not as part of a cycle of $UTP$ consumption or $PP_{i}$ release germane to this accounting. Thus, these steps contribute no net cost to our tally.\n\n2.  **Phosphorylation of the Disaccharide Backbone**\n    After the disaccharide is formed, it is phosphorylated at the $4^{\\prime}$-position by the kinase $LpxK$. A kinase is an enzyme that transfers a phosphate group from a high-energy phosphate-donating molecule, typically $ATP$, to a specific substrate. The reaction is given as an $ATP$-dependent phosphorylation:\n    $$disaccharide-1-phosphate + ATP \\rightarrow disaccharide-1,4^{\\prime}-bisphosphate + ADP + P_{i}$$\n    This reaction hydrolyzes one molecule of $ATP$ to adenosine diphosphate ($ADP$) and inorganic phosphate ($P_{i}$). It does not produce pyrophosphate ($PP_{i}$). For the synthesis of one molecule of lipid A, this phosphorylation event occurs once.\n    The costs for this stage are:\n    - $UTP$ consumed: $0$\n    - $ATP$ consumed: $1$\n    - $PP_{i}$ released: $0$\n\n3.  **Synthesis and Transfer of Kdo Residues**\n    The final product, $Kdo_{2}$-lipid A, contains two $Kdo$ residues. These are transferred from an activated sugar donor, cytidine monophosphate-activated $Kdo$ ($CMP-Kdo$). Therefore, two molecules of $CMP-Kdo$ are required.\n    The synthesis of $CMP-Kdo$ is catalyzed by $CMP-Kdo$ synthetase ($KdsB$). The reaction is:\n    $$Kdo + CTP \\rightarrow CMP-Kdo + PP_{i}$$\n    For each molecule of $CMP-Kdo$ formed, one molecule of cytidine triphosphate ($CTP$) is consumed and one molecule of $PP_{i}$ is released. To provide the two $Kdo$ residues, this reaction must occur twice.\n    The costs for activating the two $Kdo$ residues are:\n    - $CTP$ consumed: $2 \\times 1 = 2$\n    - $PP_{i}$ released: $2 \\times 1 = 2$\n\n    The problem requires accounting for $UTP$ and $ATP$ consumption only. The boundary condition states, \"Count only direct $UTP$ and $ATP$ hydrolyses\". The $KdsB$ reaction directly consumes $CTP$, not $UTP$ or $ATP$. While $CTP$ is synthesized from $UTP$ in the cell, this upstream process is part of nucleotide metabolism, which the problem boundaries explicitly exclude. Therefore, the consumption of $2$ $CTP$ does not add to the tally of $UTP$ or $ATP$. However, the problem *does* require accounting for all $PP_{i}$ released. The $KdsB$ reaction is a source of $PP_{i}$, so its contribution must be included.\n    The transferase step itself, catalyzed by $WaaA$, uses $CMP-Kdo$ as a donor and releases $CMP$. This reaction does not involve $UTP$, $ATP$, or $PP_{i}$.\n    The costs for this stage relevant to our tally are:\n    - $UTP$ consumed: $0$\n    - $ATP$ consumed: $0$\n    - $PP_{i}$ released: $2$\n\n4.  **Final Acylations and Total Stoichiometry**\n    The late acyltransferases like $LpxL$ and $LpxM$ use acyl-$ACP$ donors and, as stated, do not consume $ATP$ or $UTP$. They do not contribute to the final count.\n\n    We now sum the contributions from all stages to find the net stoichiometry for the synthesis of one molecule of $Kdo_{2}$-lipid A.\n    - **Total $UTP$ consumed** = (from GlcNAc activation) $2$ + (from phosphorylation) $0$ + (from Kdo activation) $0$ = $2$.\n    - **Total $ATP$ consumed** = (from GlcNAc activation) $0$ + (from phosphorylation) $1$ + (from Kdo activation) $0$ = $1$.\n    - **Total $PP_{i}$ released** = (from GlcNAc activation) $2$ + (from phosphorylation) $0$ + (from Kdo activation) $2$ = $4$.\n\nThe derived net stoichiometry for the synthesis of one molecule of $Kdo_{2}$-lipid A is the consumption of $2$ molecules of $UTP$, the consumption of $1$ molecule of $ATP$, and the release of $4$ molecules of $PP_{i}$.

This practice hones your ability to predict complex cellular phenotypes from a single molecular defect, a core skill in molecular microbiology.", "problem": "A Gram-negative bacterium (for example, Escherichia coli) carries a temperature-sensitive allele of the gene kdsB, which encodes 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase (KdsB). KdsB catalyzes the activation of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (KDO) with cytidine triphosphate (CTP) to form cytidine monophosphate-KDO (CMP-KDO), the essential donor substrate for the KDO transferase WaaA (also known as KdtA), which attaches KDO to the lipid A moiety as the first step of inner-core assembly in lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS is then transported to the outer membrane by the lipopolysaccharide transport (Lpt) system. At a permissive temperature $T_p$ (for example, $30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$), the mutant grows normally.

At the permissive temperature $T_p$ (e.g., $30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$), the enzyme is functional, and the bacterium grows normally. The critical event is the shift to the restrictive temperature $T_r$ (e.g., $42^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$), at which the KdsB enzyme rapidly loses its activity.\n\nLet us deduce the consequences step-by-step from first principles.\n\n1.  **Primary Biochemical Block**: The enzyme `KdsB` catalyzes the synthesis of cytidine monophosphate-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (CMP-KDO) from 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (KDO) and cytidine triphosphate (CTP).\n    $$ \\text{KDO} + \\text{CTP} \\xrightarrow{\\text{KdsB}} \\text{CMP-KDO} + \\text{PP}_i $$\n    Upon inactivation of `KdsB` at $T_r$, the synthesis of CMP-KDO ceases. Since CMP-KDO is continuously consumed in the next step of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis, its cellular pool will be rapidly depleted.\n\n2.  **Effect on Core Biosynthesis**: CMP-KDO is the essential activated sugar donor for the KDO transferase `WaaA`. This enzyme attaches the first one or more KDO residues to the lipid A precursor, initiating the assembly of the LPS core.\n    $$ \\text{Lipid A precursor} + n(\\text{CMP-KDO}) \\xrightarrow{\\text{WaaA}} \\text{KDO}_n\\text{-Lipid A precursor} + n(\\text{CMP}) $$\n    Without the donor substrate CMP-KDO, the `WaaA`-catalyzed reaction is blocked. No KDO can be attached to lipid A.\n\n3.  **Accumulation of Intermediates**: The substrate for the blocked reaction, the lipid A precursor, will accumulate. In *Escherichia coli*, this precursor is typically lipid $\\mathrm{IV_A}$ (a tetra-acylated disaccharide of glucosamine phosphate). Therefore, KDO-deficient lipid A species will build up in the inner membrane, where their synthesis occurs.\n\n4.  **Consequences for Downstream LPS Assembly**:\n    *   The entire core polysaccharide cannot be assembled, as KDO forms its innermost part.\n    *   O-antigen ligation, catalyzed by `WaaL`, requires a complete core as an acceptor. Without a core, this step fails.\n    *   The synthesis of a complete LPS molecule is therefore completely halted.\n\n5.  **Effect on LPS Transport**: The problem states that the lipopolysaccharide transport (Lpt) system recognizes a minimal core-lipid A structure for export to the outer membrane. In *E. coli*, this minimal structure is KDO$_2$-lipid A. The accumulating KDO-deficient lipid A precursor is not recognized by the Lpt system. Consequently, the transport of LPS to the outer membrane stops.\n\n6.  **Envelope Phenotype**:\n    *   **Surface LPS Depletion**: As the cell grows and divides, the existing LPS in the outer membrane is diluted, but not replaced. This results in progressive depletion of LPS from the cell surface.\n    *   **Permeability Barrier Defect**: The outer membrane's function as a permeability barrier against hydrophobic compounds (e.g., detergents, certain antibiotics) and large hydrophilic molecules (e.g., vancomycin) is critically dependent on the dense, negatively charged layer of LPS. Its loss creates patches of phospholipid bilayer, dramatically increasing outer membrane permeability.\n    *   **Antibiotic Sensitivity**: The bacterium will become hypersensitive to a wide range of agents that are normally excluded, including large antibiotics like vancomycin and hydrophobic ones like rifampicin and novobiocin.\n    *   **Deep-Rough Phenotype**: Mutants unable to synthesize the core region of LPS are termed \"rough\". A block at the very first sugar addition (KDO) results in the most severe truncation, known as a deep-rough phenotype.\n    *   **Envelope Stress and Lethality**: The accumulation of toxic lipid precursors in the inner membrane and the structural failure of the outer membrane trigger potent envelope stress responses. The loss of the LPS-dependent barrier is catastrophic, and for most Gram-negative bacteria, including *E. coli*, this condition is lethal.\n\nBased on this derivation, we evaluate the provided options.\n\n**A. Rapid depletion of surface LPS with accumulation of KDO-deficient lipid A species (for example, lipid $\\mathrm{IV_A}$) in the inner membrane; failure of O-antigen ligation; impeded recognition by the Lpt system; envelope stress and increased permeability leading to heightened sensitivity to large antibiotics (for example, vancomycin); a deep-rough phenotype.**\nThis option comprehensively and accurately describes every consequence derived from the inactivation of `KdsB`. It correctly identifies the accumulating precursor (lipid $\\mathrm{IV_A}$), the blocked downstream steps (O-antigen ligation, Lpt transport), and the resulting phenotypic effects (permeability, antibiotic sensitivity, deep-rough phenotype).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Accumulation of CMP-KDO and accelerated KDO transfer, yielding hyper-elongated inner cores and enhanced barrier function; decreased sensitivity to detergents and hydrophobic antibiotics.**\nThis option starts with a fundamentally flawed premise. Inactivation of `KdsB`, the enzyme that synthesizes CMP-KDO, leads to the depletion, not accumulation, of CMP-KDO. All subsequent predictions in this option are therefore incorrect and describe the opposite of the expected outcome.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Persistence of normal LPS export because KdsA supplies KDO directly to WaaA without prior activation; only minor growth effects at $T_r$.**\nThis option proposes a bypass mechanism that violates a stated fundamental principle: glycosyltransferases require activated sugar donors (sugar-nucleotides). `WaaA` uses CMP-KDO, not free KDO. The enzyme `KdsA` synthesizes a KDO precursor and cannot substitute for `KdsB`. Furthermore, the block in LPS synthesis is known to be lethal, not a cause of minor growth effects.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Replacement of KDO by heptose through substrate specificity switching in WaaA, producing a heptose-initiated core that is sufficiently recognized by the Lpt system; moderate outer membrane defects but overall viability.**\nThis option invokes a speculative promiscuity of the `WaaA` enzyme. While some enzymes show limited substrate flexibility, a complete switch from CMP-KDO to an activated heptose donor is biochemically highly improbable and not a known salvage mechanism. The enzymes for heptose transfer are distinct and act only after KDO is incorporated. The essentiality of the `kdsB` gene in *E. coli* demonstrates that such a bypass is not sufficient for viability.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Continued Lpt export of lipid A lacking KDO, surface display of lipid A, and normal O-antigen ligation by WaaL; negligible change in outer membrane permeability at $T_r$.**\nThis option makes several factually incorrect assertions. First, the Lpt system does not export KDO-less lipid A precursors, as this violates its substrate recognition requirements. Second, `WaaL` cannot ligate O-antigen without a complete core acceptor. Third, the loss of LPS from the outer membrane results in a severe, not negligible, increase in permeability.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2504653"}]}
