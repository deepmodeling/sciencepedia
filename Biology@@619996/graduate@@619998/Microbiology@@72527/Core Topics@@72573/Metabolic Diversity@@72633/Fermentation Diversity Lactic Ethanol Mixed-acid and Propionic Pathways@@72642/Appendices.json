The solution must be derived from fundamental biochemical principles of conservation: mass (carbon precursor), energy (ATP), and redox potential (NADH).\n\nFirst, we must formalize the constraints given in the problem statement into a system of algebraic equations. Let $a$, $e$, $s$, and $l$ be the molar yields of acetate, ethanol, succinate, and lactate, respectively, per mole of glucose consumed.\n\n1.  **$C_3$ Precursor Balance:**\n    Glycolysis of one mole of glucose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$) produces two moles of $C_3$ precursors at the level of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and pyruvate. These precursors are the entry points for all subsequent fermentation pathways.\n    -   The succinate branch consumes one PEP ($C_3$) per mole of succinate produced. Thus, a yield of $s$ consumes $s$ moles of $C_3$ precursor.\n    -   The lactate branch consumes one pyruvate ($C_3$) per mole of lactate. A yield of $l$ consumes $l$ moles of $C_3$ precursor.\n    -   The acetate and ethanol branches both originate from acetyl-CoA, which is formed from pyruvate via the pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL) reaction. One mole of pyruvate yields one mole of acetyl-CoA. This acetyl-CoA pool is then partitioned into acetate and ethanol.
