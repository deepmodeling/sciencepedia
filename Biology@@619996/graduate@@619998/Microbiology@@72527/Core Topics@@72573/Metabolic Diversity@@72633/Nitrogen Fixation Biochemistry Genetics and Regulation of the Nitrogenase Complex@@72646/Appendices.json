The active nitrogenase complex comprises dinitrogenase (NifDK) and dinitrogenase reductase (NifH). In this organism, short-term regulation of nitrogenase is mediated by reversible covalent modification of NifH: the dinitrogenase reductase Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP)-ribosyl transferase (DraT) adds ADP-ribose to a specific arginine in NifH, inactivating nitrogenase; the dinitrogenase reductase ADP-ribosyl-glycohydrolase (DraG) removes the ADP-ribose, reactivating nitrogenase. Acetylene Reduction Assay (ARA), which quantifies the reduction of acetylene ($\\mathrm{C_2H_2}$) to ethylene ($\\mathrm{C_2H_4}$), is used to report nitrogenase activity.\n\nThree isogenic strains are compared: wild-type, a draT knockout (no DraT), and a draG knockout (no DraG). At time $t = 0$ min, ammonium chloride is added to each culture to a final concentration of $10$ mM to impose an ammonium upshift. ARA is measured continuously for $30$ min after the upshift. At $t = 30$ min, cultures are washed and resuspended in the same medium lacking combined nitrogen, and ARA is monitored for an additional $150$ min ($t = 30$ to $180$ min). Dissolved oxygen, temperature, and carbon supply are held constant; protein synthesis machinery is not inhibited. You may assume the following widely established bases: (i) covalent modification of enzymes can rapidly and reversibly control activity on the order of minutes, (ii) loss of a gene function via knockout removes the corresponding enzymatic activity, (iii) nitrogenase activity measured by ARA directly reflects NifH-dependent electron delivery to NifDK, and (iv) transcriptional repression by ammonium of the nif regulon affects enzyme abundance on timescales typically longer than $30$ to $60$ min.\n\nWhich option best predicts the immediate ARA switch-off upon the ammonium upshift and the subsequent recovery kinetics upon ammonium removal for each strain under these conditions?\n\nA. Wild-type exhibits a rapid ARA drop to $<10\\%$ of initial within $5$ min after ammonium addition and regains $>80\\%$ of initial ARA within $10$ min of ammonium removal; the draT knockout retains $>70\\%$ of initial ARA at $5$ min post-upshift with only a gradual decline thereafter and shows no need for rapid “recovery” upon ammonium removal; the draG knockout shows a rapid ARA drop to near-baseline within $5$ min after ammonium addition and fails to recover appreciably ($<20\\%$ of initial) within $60$ min after ammonium removal, recovering only on longer timescales consistent with de novo protein synthesis.\n\nB.

Wild-type undergoes rapid ARA inactivation after ammonium addition but cannot rapidly recover upon ammonium removal; the draT knockout behaves like wild-type with rapid inactivation; the draG knockout avoids inactivation upon ammonium addition and displays higher-than-initial ARA (“overshoot”) within $10$ min after ammonium removal due to accumulation of reduced NifH.", "solution": "### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires a logical deduction of the behavior of each strain based on the provided regulatory model. The core of the problem is the function of the two regulatory enzymes, DraT and DraG, in response to ammonium. Ammonium is a signal of nitrogen sufficiency, which triggers the inactivation of nitrogen fixation to conserve energy.\n\n- **DraT**: The \"switch-off\" enzyme. It is activated by a signal derived from ammonium. Its function is to ADP-ribosylate NifH, rendering it inactive.\n- **DraG**: The \"switch-on\" enzyme. It is active when the ammonium signal is absent. Its function is to remove the ADP-ribose from NifH, restoring its activity.\n\nWe analyze each strain's response to the experimental protocol.\n\n**1. Wild-Type Strain (has both DraT and DraG)**\n\n- **Ammonium Upshift ($t = 0$ to $30$ min)**: Upon addition of $10$ mM ammonium chloride, the intracellular signal for nitrogen sufficiency will rapidly activate DraT. DraT will covalently modify the pool of active NifH proteins by adding ADP-ribose. According to assumption (i), this modification is rapid (on the order of minutes). Therefore, nitrogenase activity, measured by ARA, is expected to decrease sharply and significantly, approaching a near-zero baseline within minutes.\n- **Ammonium Removal ($t > 30$ min)**: When ammonium is removed by washing, the intracellular signal for inactivation disappears. This leads to the activation of DraG. DraG will cleave the ADP-ribose moiety from the inactive NifH pool. This de-modification reactivates the existing nitrogenase complexes. This process is also a rapid enzymatic reaction. Thus, we expect a swift recovery of ARA to a high level, near the initial activity, within minutes of ammonium removal.\n\n**2. *draT* Knockout Strain (has DraG, no DraT)**\n\n- **Ammonium Upshift ($t = 0$ to $30$ min)**: This strain lacks the DraT enzyme, the \"switch-off\" mechanism. When ammonium is added, the cell receives the signal, but it cannot execute the rapid inactivation of NifH via ADP-ribosylation. Nitrogenase will remain active. Therefore, ARA should not show a rapid drop. According to assumption (iv), a slower, gradual decline in activity might occur over a longer timescale due to transcriptional repression of *nif* genes, but significant activity should be retained over the initial $30$ min period.\n- **Ammonium Removal ($t > 30$ min)**: Since the nitrogenase was never rapidly inactivated by covalent modification, there is no large pool of modified NifH to reactivate. The ARA would simply reflect the activity level present at $t = 30$ min. There is no \"recovery\" phase in the sense of rapid reactivation, because there was no rapid inactivation to begin with.\n\n**3. *draG* Knockout Strain (has DraT, no DraG)**\n\n- **Ammonium Upshift ($t = 0$ to $30$ min)**: This strain possesses a functional DraT (\"switch-off\") but lacks the DraG (\"switch-on\") enzyme. Upon ammonium addition, DraT will be activated and will rapidly ADP-ribosylate and inactivate the NifH protein pool. The behavior will be identical to the wild-type in this phase: a rapid and profound drop in ARA.\n- **Ammonium Removal ($t > 30$ min)**: When ammonium is removed, the signal for inactivation is gone. In a wild-type cell, DraG would now become active and remove the modification. However, this strain lacks DraG. The NifH proteins are \"trapped\" in their inactive, ADP-ribosylated state. The cell cannot rapidly reverse the modification. Restoration of nitrogenase activity would depend on the degradation of the modified, inactive proteins and the *de novo* synthesis of new, unmodified nitrogenase proteins. According to assumption (iv), this is a slow process, taking longer than $30$ to $60$ min. Therefore, this strain will fail to show any significant recovery of ARA in the short term (e.g., within $60$ min) after ammonium removal.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**Option A:**\n- **Wild-type**: \"rapid ARA drop to $<10\\%$ of initial within $5$ min after ammonium addition and regains $>80\\%$ of initial ARA within $10$ min of ammonium removal\". This precisely matches our deduction for the wild-type strain, which has both the rapid switch-off (DraT) and rapid switch-on (DraG) mechanisms.\n- ***draT* knockout**: \"retains $>70\\%$ of initial ARA at $5$ min post-upshift with only a gradual decline thereafter and shows no need for rapid 'recovery' upon ammonium removal\". This correctly describes the behavior of a strain lacking the switch-off enzyme. It cannot inactivate rapidly.\n- ***draG* knockout**: \"shows a rapid ARA drop to near-baseline within $5$ min after ammonium addition and fails to recover appreciably ($<20\\%$ of initial) within $60$ min after ammonium removal, recovering only on longer timescales consistent with de novo protein synthesis\". This correctly describes the behavior of a strain that can switch off but cannot switch back on, becoming trapped in the inactive state and requiring slow protein synthesis for recovery.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**. This option accurately predicts the behavior of all three strains based on the provided regulatory model.\n\n**Option B:**\n- **Wild-type**: \"gradual ARA decrease...requires $>60$ min...to recover\". This contradicts the known rapid nature of this covalent modification system (assumption (i)). The recovery mechanism via DraG is enzymatic and fast, not dependent on slow de novo synthesis.\n- ***draT* knockout**: \"shows rapid switch-off\". This is fundamentally incorrect. The *draT* mutant lacks the enzyme required for rapid switch-off.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C:**\n- **Wild-type**: \"ARA is unaffected by ammonium on the $<30$ min timescale\". This is false; ammonium is the primary signal for rapid inactivation in this well-studied system.\n- **Both knockouts**: \"exhibit rapid ($<5$ min) ARA inactivation\". This is false for the *draT* knockout, which cannot inactivate rapidly.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D:**\n- **Wild-type**: \"undergoes rapid ARA inactivation after ammonium addition but cannot rapidly recover upon ammonium removal\". The second part is false. The presence of DraG ensures rapid recovery.\n- ***draT* knockout**: \"behaves like wild-type with rapid inactivation\". This is false. Its phenotype is defined by its inability to rapidly inactivate.\n- ***draG* knockout**: \"avoids inactivation upon ammonium addition\". This is false. It has the DraT enzyme and will inactivate rapidly.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nThe analysis confirms that only option A provides a set of predictions consistent with the established principles of nitrogenase regulation by the DraT/DraG system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2514720"}]}
