The enzymes and their reactions are canonical. The regulatory logic (catabolite repression of the glyoxylate shunt by glucose) is a well-established principle in microbiology (e.g., in *Escherichia coli*). The problem is firmly based on established biochemical facts.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem sets up a clear logical puzzle. The metabolic network is defined by the presence and function of specific enzymes. The objective—predicting growth based on the ability to perform anaplerosis—is unambiguous. The constraints are clearly listed, allowing for a unique solution to be deduced.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is technical and precise. It is free of ambiguity, subjectivity, or opinion.\n4.  **Completeness**: All necessary information is provided. The key anaplerotic enzymes are specified, their functions are defined, regulatory states are given, and the available substrates are listed. The problem is self-contained.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. A rigorous solution can be derived from the provided information.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe ability of the bacterium to grow on a given carbon source depends on its capacity to both generate energy and synthesize all necessary biomass precursors. A critical requirement for biosynthesis is the withdrawal of intermediates from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, such as oxaloacetate (OAA) and $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate. This withdrawal necessitates anaplerosis: the net replenishment of these intermediates. We must analyze the anaplerotic capabilities of each strain on each specific carbon source.\n\n**1. Growth on Glucose ($C_6$)**\n- **Metabolic Flow**: Glucose is metabolized via glycolysis to produce phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and pyruvate. Pyruvate is then converted to acetyl-CoA, which enters the TCA cycle by condensing with OAA.\n- **Anaplerotic Need**: The TCA cycle is catabolic (energy generation) and anabolic (precursor supply). As OAA and other intermediates are drained for biosynthesis, the OAA pool must be replenished to sustain the cycle.\n- **Available Pathways**: On glucose, both PEP and pyruvate are available. The two defined anaplerotic reactions are:\n    - PPC: $ \\mathrm{PEP} + \\mathrm{HCO_3^-} \\to \\mathrm{OAA} + \\mathrm{P_i}$\n    - PYC: $ \\mathrm{pyruvate} + \\mathrm{HCO_3^-} + \\mathrm{ATP} \\to \\mathrm{OAA} + \\mathrm{ADP} + \\mathrm{P_i}$\n- **Conclusion**: Growth on glucose requires at least one of these two enzymes to be functional. The glyoxylate shunt is repressed and thus unavailable.\n    - **WT**: Has both PYC and PPC. **Growth**.\n    - **$ \\Delta \\mathrm{pyc}$**: Lacks PYC but has PPC. PPC is sufficient. **Growth**.\n    - **$ \\Delta \\mathrm{ppc}$**: Lacks PPC but has PYC. PYC is sufficient. **Growth**.\n    - **$ \\Delta \\mathrm{pyc} \\ \\Delta \\mathrm{ppc}$**: Lacks both anaplerotic pathways from $C_3$ compounds. The TCA cycle cannot be replenished. **No Growth**.\n\n**2. Growth on Acetate ($C_2$)**\n- **Metabolic Flow**: Acetate ($C_2$) is converted to acetyl-CoA. To produce the $C_3$ (e.g., PEP for gluconeogenesis) and $C_4$ precursors required for biomass, the cell must have a pathway for the net synthesis of these compounds from acetyl-CoA.\n- **Anaplerotic Need**: The problem is not merely replenishing the TCA cycle, but constructing it and all other precursors from $C_2$ units. This is the canonical role of the glyoxylate shunt.\n- **Available Pathways**: The problem states the glyoxylate shunt is induced on acetate. The shunt bypasses the two decarboxylation steps of the TCA cycle (isocitrate dehydrogenase and $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase). The net reaction of one turn of the shunt is $2\\ \\text{acetyl-CoA} \\to \\text{succinate} + 2\\ \\text{CoA}$. Succinate is a $C_4$ intermediate that can be converted to malate and then OAA. This process provides a net synthesis of $C_4$ compounds from $C_2$ units, thereby fulfilling the anaplerotic requirement and providing the backbone for gluconeogenesis (via PCK: $ \\mathrm{OAA} \\to \\mathrm{PEP}$).\n- **Conclusion**: The glyoxylate shunt is both necessary and sufficient for anaplerosis on acetate. The anaplerotic carboxylases PYC and PPC are not required.\n    - **WT, $ \\Delta \\mathrm{pyc}$, $ \\Delta \\mathrm{ppc}$, $ \\Delta \\mathrm{pyc} \\ \\Delta \\mathrm{ppc}$**: All four strains possess a functional glyoxylate shunt. Therefore, all four strains will exhibit **Growth**.\n\n**3. Growth on Pyruvate ($C_3$)**\n- **Metabolic Flow**: Pyruvate ($C_3$) is a central branching point. It can be converted via pyruvate dehydrogenase to acetyl-CoA ($C_2$) for entry into the TCA cycle, or it can be used for gluconeogenesis or anaplerosis.\n- **Anaplerotic Need**: When pyruvate is the sole carbon source, its conversion to acetyl-CoA involves a loss of a carbon atom as $\\mathrm{CO_2}$. Condensation of this acetyl-CoA with OAA to run the TCA cycle would deplete the OAA pool if there were no way to synthesize a $C_4$ intermediate from the $C_3$ substrate. Therefore, an anaplerotic reaction is essential.\n- **Available Pathways**: The glyoxylate shunt is repressed on pyruvate. Malic enzymes are strictly decarboxylating. The only available routes to synthesize OAA from pyruvate are:\n    - PYC (direct): $ \\mathrm{pyruvate} \\to \\mathrm{OAA}$\n    - PpsA followed by PPC (indirect): $ \\mathrm{pyruvate} \\to \\mathrm{PEP} \\to \\mathrm{OAA}$\n- **Conclusion**: Growth on pyruvate requires at least one of these two pathways.\n    - **WT**: Has both PYC and the PpsA+PPC route. **Growth**.\n    - **$ \\Delta \\mathrm{pyc}$**: Lacks PYC but has the PpsA+PPC pathway. **Growth**.\n    - **$ \\Delta \\mathrm{ppc}$**: Lacks PPC but has PYC. **Growth**.\n    - **$ \\Delta \\mathrm{pyc} \\ \\Delta \\mathrm{ppc}$**: Lacks both PYC and PPC. There is no route to synthesize OAA from pyruvate. **No Growth**.\n\n**Summary of Predictions:**\n- **Wild type**: Growth on glucose, acetate, and pyruvate.\n- **$ \\Delta \\mathrm{pyc}$**: Growth on glucose, acetate, and pyruvate.\n- **$ \\Delta \\mathrm{ppc}$**: Growth on glucose, acetate, and pyruvate.\n- **$ \\Delta \\mathrm{pyc} \\ \\Delta \\mathrm{ppc}$**: No growth on glucose, growth on acetate, no growth on pyruvate.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n- **A.

This follows from: (i) isotopic mass balance linearity for unimolecular transforms of EMUs, (ii) linear mixing at convergence nodes where each contributor is weighted by its normalized split fraction, and (iii) selection of observables that isolate independent contributions of $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$ without multiplicative cross-terms.\n\nGiven a measured $\\mathbf{y}$ and known $(A,\\mathbf{c})$, estimating $\\mathbf{x}$ reduces to solving the linear least-squares system\n$$\n\\min_{\\mathbf{x}\\in [0,1]^{3}} \\left\\|A\\,\\mathbf{x} - (\\mathbf{y}-\\mathbf{c})\\right\\|_{2}.\n$$\nYou must implement this estimation for the following test suite.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of ${}^{13}$C-Metabolic Flux Analysis, specifically using the Elementary Metabolite Unit (EMU) framework, which is a standard and rigorous method in systems biology. The problem is well-posed, providing a complete set of data and a clear, objective task: to solve a constrained linear least-squares problem. The mathematical formulation $\\mathbf{y} = A\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{c}$ is a direct and correct representation of EMU propagation and linear mixing at metabolic nodes under isotopic steady-state conditions. The problem is entirely self-contained, factually sound, and mathematically unambiguous. Therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to estimate the vector of metabolic split fractions $\\mathbf{x} = [\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma]^{\\top}$ given a set of measurements $\\mathbf{y}$, from the affine model $\\mathbf{y} = A\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{c}$. This estimation is formulated as a box-constrained least-squares problem:\n$$\n\\min_{\\mathbf{x} \\in [0,1]^3} \\| A\\mathbf{x} - (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{c}) \\|_2\n$$\nThe problem specifies a pragmatic two-step procedure to find an approximate solution. First, the unconstrained least-squares solution $\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{unc}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ is determined. This solution minimizes the Euclidean norm of the residual and is found by solving the normal equations:\n$$\nA^{\\top}A \\mathbf{x}_{\\text{unc}} = A^{\\top} \\mathbf{b}\n$$\nwhere we define $\\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{c}$. The provided matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{5 \\times 3}$ has full column rank, which guarantees that the matrix $A^{\\top}A$ is invertible and the unconstrained solution is unique:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{unc}} = (A^{\\top}A)^{-1} A^{\\top} \\mathbf{b}\n$$\nSecond, the box constraints $x_i \\in [0, 1]$ for each component of $\\mathbf{x}$ are enforced by clipping the components of the unconstrained solution. The final estimate $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\hat{x}_i = \\text{clip}(x_{\\text{unc}, i}, 0, 1) = \\max(0, \\min(x_{\\text{unc}, i}, 1))\n$$\nWe will now apply this procedure to each of the three test cases using the provided constant matrix $A$ and vector $\\mathbf{c}$:\n$$\nA =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0.8 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\\\\n0.0 & 0.9 & 0.0 \\\\\n0.0 & 0.0 & 0.7 \\\\\n0.3 & 0.0 & 0.4 \\\\\n0.0 & 0.5 & 0.2\n\\end{bmatrix},\n\\quad\n\\mathbf{c} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0.1 \\\\\n0.05 \\\\\n0.2 \\\\\n0.12 \\\\\n0.06\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n**Case 1:**\nThe measurement vector is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}^{(1)} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0.34 \\\\\n0.59 \\\\\n0.48 \\\\\n0.37 \\\\\n0.44\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nFirst, we compute the translated vector $\\mathbf{b}^{(1)} = \\mathbf{y}^{(1)} - \\mathbf{c}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{b}^{(1)} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0.34 - 0.1 \\\\\n0.59 - 0.05 \\\\\n0.48 - 0.2 \\\\\n0.37 - 0.12 \\\\\n0.44 - 0.06\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0.24 \\\\\n0.54 \\\\\n0.28 \\\\\n0.25 \\\\\n0.38\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nSolving the unconstrained least-squares problem $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}^{(1)}$ yields:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{unc}}^{(1)} \\approx\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0.264 \\\\\n0.519 \\\\\n0.301\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nAll components of $\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{unc}}^{(1)}$ are within the interval $[0,1]$.
