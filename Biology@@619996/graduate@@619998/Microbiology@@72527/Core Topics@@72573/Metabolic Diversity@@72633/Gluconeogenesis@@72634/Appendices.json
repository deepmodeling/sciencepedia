All enzymes (PpsA, PckA, PDH), pathways (glyoxylate shunt, TCA cycle), and metabolic constraints (lack of pyruvate carboxylase, irreversibility of pyruvate kinase) are factually correct for *E. coli* K-12. The scenario described is a classic problem in metabolic pathway analysis.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The question is well-posed. It provides a specific organism, a defined genetic background, a single carbon source, and asks for a predictable outcome based on the metabolic network's topology and constraints.

The lack of PpsA creates a clear metabolic challenge, and the other stated facts provide the necessary components to reason about potential bypasses. The assumption that the glyoxylate shunt and PckA are expressed under these conditions is critical and correctly reflects the known regulation of *E. coli* metabolism on non-glycolytic substrates.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a rigorous test of understanding central carbon metabolism. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe organism must grow on lactate ($C_3H_5O_3^-$) as the sole carbon source. Growth requires the synthesis of all essential biomass precursors from lactate. One such essential precursor, explicitly mentioned, is phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), a $C_3$ compound required for gluconeogenesis (synthesis of hexose phosphates for cell wall, nucleotides) and for aromatic amino acid synthesis.\n\nIn wild-type *E. coli*, lactate is oxidized to pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase. For gluconeogenesis, pyruvate must be converted to PEP. The primary, most direct route for this conversion is catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase (PpsA):\n$$ \\text{Pyruvate} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{PEP} + \\text{AMP} + \\mathrm{P_i} $$\nThis reaction consumes two high-energy phosphate bonds.\n\nThe problem states that the gene *ppsA* is deleted. Therefore, this direct route is blocked. We must identify an alternative, biochemically feasible path from pyruvate to PEP using the enzymes and pathways available.\n\n1.  **Input to the system**: Lactate is converted to pyruvate. The cell has an abundance of pyruvate derived from the carbon source.\n2.  **Constraint Analysis**:\n    - The reverse reaction of pyruvate kinase (pyruvate $+$ ATP $\\rightarrow$ PEP $+$ ADP) is thermodynamically and physiologically unfavorable and is correctly stated as irreversible. This route is not an option.\n    - *E. coli* lacks pyruvate carboxylase, so the direct conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate (OAA) is not possible.\n\n3.  **Exploring Alternative Pathways**: The problem states that the glyoxylate shunt and PckA are active. This is the crucial information. Let us construct the pathway:\n    -   **Step A: Pyruvate to Acetyl-CoA.** Pyruvate can be decarboxylated to acetyl-CoA ($C_2$) via the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex:\n        $$ \\text{Pyruvate} + \\text{NAD}^+ + \\text{CoA} \\rightarrow \\text{Acetyl-CoA} + \\text{NADH} + \\text{CO}_2 $$\n    -   **Step B: Acetyl-CoA to OAA.** Acetyl-CoA cannot be converted to a net $C_4$ intermediate via the standard TCA cycle because two carbons are lost as $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ for every acetyl-CoA that enters. However, the glyoxylate shunt provides a bypass of these decarboxylation steps. The net effect of this pathway is the conversion of two molecules of acetyl-CoA into one molecule of succinate, which is a $C_4$ dicarboxylate.\n        $$ 2 \\text{ Acetyl-CoA} \\rightarrow \\text{Succinate} + 2 \\text{ CoA} $$\n        Succinate can then be oxidized to fumarate, then malate, and finally to oxaloacetate (OAA) via the remaining enzymes of the TCA cycle (succinate dehydrogenase, fumarase, malate dehydrogenase). Thus, a net synthesis of OAA from acetyl-CoA is possible.\n    -   **Step C: OAA to PEP.** The enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PckA) catalyzes the conversion of OAA to PEP:\n        $$ \\text{OAA} + \\text{GTP} \\rightarrow \\text{PEP} + \\text{GDP} + \\text{CO}_2 $$\n\n4.  **Synthesis**: By combining these steps, a complete, albeit circuitous, pathway from pyruvate to PEP emerges in the *ppsA* mutant:\n    $$ \\text{Lactate} \\rightarrow \\text{Pyruvate} \\xrightarrow{\\text{PDH}} \\text{Acetyl-CoA} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Glyoxylate Shunt}} \\text{OAA} \\xrightarrow{\\text{PckA}} \\text{PEP} $$\n    This pathway is biochemically sound and relies only on enzymes and pathways stated to be present. Therefore, the *ppsA* mutant should be capable of growth on lactate.\n\n5.  **Growth Rate Prediction**: The wild-type pathway is a single enzymatic step ($PpsA$). The bypass route involves multiple enzymes, including a carbon-losing step (PDH) that necessitates the complex stoichiometry of the glyoxylate shunt to achieve net carbon assimilation into $C_4$ compounds and subsequently PEP. This bypass is significantly less direct and less carbon-efficient. For instance, creating one $C_3$ PEP molecule via this route ultimately requires the consumption of two $C_3$ pyruvate molecules (which become two $C_2$ acetyl-CoA molecules, which form one $C_4$ OAA, which is then decarboxylated to one $C_3$ PEP). This inherent inefficiency will result in a lower biomass yield and a slower growth rate compared to the wild-type strain.\n\n6.  **Dependency on PckA**: In this *ppsA* mutant background, the PckA-catalyzed reaction is the sole remaining path to synthesize PEP from TCA cycle intermediates. If the *pckA* gene were also deleted, both major gluconeogenic routes from the pyruvate/OAA node to PEP would be blocked. The organism would be unable to synthesize PEP and therefore unable to grow. This confirms the critical nature of the PckA-dependent bypass.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. Growth is possible but slower than wild type; PEP is supplied via OAA $\\rightarrow$ PEP by PckA, with OAA produced from lactate through PDH to acetyl-CoA and assimilation via the glyoxylate shunt; loss of pckA in this background abolishes growth on lactate.**\n    This statement accurately describes the entire chain of reasoning derived above. It correctly identifies that growth is possible, that it is slower, identifies the correct multi-step bypass pathway (PDH, glyoxylate shunt, PckA), and correctly predicts the lethal phenotype of a *ppsA pckA* double mutant.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. No growth occurs even if PckA is present, because without pyruvate carboxylase there is no way to make OAA from lactate; therefore PEP cannot be formed.**\n    This statement is fundamentally flawed. It correctly notes the absence of pyruvate carboxylase but incorrectly concludes that this makes OAA synthesis impossible. It completely ignores the stated and active glyoxylate shunt, which is the precise biological solution to this problem, allowing synthesis of $C_4$ compounds from the $C_2$ unit acetyl-CoA.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Growth is unaffected because pyruvate kinase readily runs in reverse from pyruvate to PEP during gluconeogenesis on lactate.**\n    This statement directly contradicts a fundamental principle of metabolism and a fact explicitly provided in the problem statement: \"pyruvate kinase is physiologically irreversible\". The large negative Gibbs free energy change of the forward reaction makes the reverse reaction non-feasible under cellular conditions.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Growth occurs only under anaerobic conditions, because the phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) can generate PEP without PpsA when lactate is the sole carbon source.**\n    The problem specifies aerobic growth. Shifting the context to anaerobic conditions is irrelevant. Furthermore, the PTS is a system for carbohydrate transport that *consumes* PEP to phosphorylate the incoming sugar. It is a net sink for PEP, not a source for gluconeogenesis from non-carbohydrate substrates like lactate.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. Growth is improved relative to wild type because the OAA $\\rightarrow$ PEP route conserves ATP compared to the pyruvate $\\rightarrow$ PEP route.**\n    This assessment is naive and incorrect. While the PckA reaction itself costs one high-energy bond (GTP) and the PpsA reaction costs two (ATP $\\rightarrow$ AMP), this comparison ignores the upstream metabolic cost of producing the substrate, OAA. The pathway to OAA from pyruvate involves significant carbon loss (via PDH) and requires a complex, multi-enzyme sequence (glyoxylate shunt). The overall pathway is far less efficient in terms of both carbon and energy than the direct PpsA route. Consequently, growth cannot be improved; it must be impaired.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2497494"}, {"introduction": "While we can draw metabolic maps, quantifying how much carbon flows through a specific path in a living cell requires sophisticated experimental techniques.

Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) of a G6P fragment that reports the intact carbon backbone yields mass isotopomer fractions $m_{k}$, where $m_{k}$ is the fraction of molecules containing exactly $k$ atoms of $^{13}\\text{C}$, with $k \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$. Under this tracer, higher enrichments $k \\geq 3$ are below detection and can be taken as zero for this dataset.\n\nAt isotopic steady state, assume that newly synthesized G6P molecules arise exclusively by two mutually exclusive routes: via the glyoxylate shunt (route $\\mathrm{GS}$) or via decarboxylating TCA cycle routes that do not pass through the glyoxylate shunt (route $\\mathrm{DC}$). Let $f$ denote the fraction of G6P molecules formed via route $\\mathrm{GS}$, so that the fraction formed via route $\\mathrm{DC}$ is $(1 - f)$. Under the same tracer condition, two reference strains are measured to provide route-specific G6P mass isotopomer distributions: a glyoxylate-shunt-only strain (isocitrate dehydrogenase inactivated) representing route $\\mathrm{GS}$, and a glyoxylate-shunt knockout strain (isocitrate lyase inactivated) representing route $\\mathrm{DC}$. The measured distributions are as follows:\n- Route $\\mathrm{GS}$ reference: $m_{0}^{\\mathrm{GS}} = 0.10$, $m_{1}^{\\mathrm{GS}} = 0.50$, $m_{2}^{\\mathrm{GS}} = 0.40$.\n- Route $\\mathrm{DC}$ reference: $m_{0}^{\\mathrm{DC}} = 0.70$, $m_{1}^{\\mathrm{DC}} = 0.28$, $m_{2}^{\\mathrm{DC}} = 0.02$.\n\nIn the wild-type strain grown under the same tracer and conditions, the measured G6P mass isotopomer fractions are:\n- Wild-type: $m_{0}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = 0.490$, $m_{1}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = 0.357$, $m_{2}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = 0.153$.\n\nStarting only from the definitions of isotopic steady state, conservation of mass, and the linearity of mixing for mass isotopomer fractions when independent sources feed a common product pool, derive an expression for $f$ in terms of the measured $m_{k}$ and compute its value using the data above.

It is self-contained, scientifically sound, and mathematically solvable. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe core principle for solving this problem is the conservation of mass isotopomers at isotopic steady state. The pool of G6P in the wild-type organism is a linear mixture of G6P molecules synthesized through two distinct and mutually exclusive pathways: the glyoxylate shunt (GS) and the decarboxylating TCA cycle routes (DC).\n\nThe mass isotopomer distribution (MID) of the wild-type G6P, denoted by the vector of fractions $\\mathbf{m}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = \\begin{pmatrix} m_{0}^{\\mathrm{WT}} \\\\ m_{1}^{\\mathrm{WT}} \\\\ m_{2}^{\\mathrm{WT}} \\end{pmatrix}$, is a weighted average of the MIDs from the two contributing source pathways, $\\mathbf{m}^{\\mathrm{GS}} = \\begin{pmatrix} m_{0}^{\\mathrm{GS}} \\\\ m_{1}^{\\mathrm{GS}} \\\\ m_{2}^{\\mathrm{GS}} \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{m}^{\\mathrm{DC}} = \\begin{pmatrix} m_{0}^{\\mathrm{DC}} \\\\ m_{1}^{\\mathrm{DC}} \\\\ m_{2}^{\\mathrm{DC}} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe weights in this average are the fractional contributions of each pathway to the total G6P synthesis. The fractional contribution of the GS route is denoted by $f$, and thus the fractional contribution of the DC route is $(1-f)$. The relationship is expressed by the following linear mixing equation:\n$$ \\mathbf{m}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = f \\cdot \\mathbf{m}^{\\mathrm{GS}} + (1 - f) \\cdot \\mathbf{m}^{\\mathrm{DC}} $$\n\nThis vector equation represents a system of scalar equations, one for each mass isotopomer $k$:\n$$ m_{k}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = f \\cdot m_{k}^{\\mathrm{GS}} + (1 - f) \\cdot m_{k}^{\\mathrm{DC}} \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\} $$\n\nTo derive an expression for $f$, we can rearrange this equation for any given $k$. Let us perform the algebraic manipulation for a general index $k$:\n$$ m_{k}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = f \\cdot m_{k}^{\\mathrm{GS}} + m_{k}^{\\mathrm{DC}} - f \\cdot m_{k}^{\\mathrm{DC}} $$\n$$ m_{k}^{\\mathrm{WT}} - m_{k}^{\\mathrm{DC}} = f \\cdot (m_{k}^{\\mathrm{GS}} - m_{k}^{\\mathrm{DC}}) $$\nProvided that $m_{k}^{\\mathrm{GS}} \\neq m_{k}^{\\mathrm{DC}}$, we can isolate $f$:\n$$ f = \\frac{m_{k}^{\\mathrm{WT}} - m_{k}^{\\mathrm{DC}}}{m_{k}^{\\mathrm{GS}} - m_{k}^{\\mathrm{DC}}} $$\nThis is the general expression for $f$ in terms of the measurable mass isotopomer fractions.\n\nNow, we compute the value of $f$ using the data provided. Since the data is given for $k = 0, 1, 2$, we can calculate $f$ from each isotopomer measurement. This provides a robust check for the consistency of the experimental data and the validity of the model.\n\nFor $k=0$:\n$$ f = \\frac{m_{0}^{\\mathrm{WT}} - m_{0}^{\\mathrm{DC}}}{m_{0}^{\\mathrm{GS}} - m_{0}^{\\mathrm{DC}}} = \\frac{0.490 - 0.70}{0.10 - 0.70} = \\frac{-0.210}{-0.600} = 0.35 $$\n\nFor $k=1$:\n$$ f = \\frac{m_{1}^{\\mathrm{WT}} - m_{1}^{\\mathrm{DC}}}{m_{1}^{\\mathrm{GS}} - m_{1}^{\\mathrm{DC}}} = \\frac{0.357 - 0.28}{0.50 - 0.28} = \\frac{0.077}{0.22} = 0.35 $$\n\nFor $k=2$:\n$$ f = \\frac{m_{2}^{\\mathrm{WT}} - m_{2}^{\\mathrm{DC}}}{m_{2}^{\\mathrm{GS}} - m_{2}^{\\mathrm{DC}}} = \\frac{0.153 - 0.02}{0.40 - 0.02} = \\frac{0.133}{0.38} = 0.35 $$\n\nAll three calculations yield an identical result of $f=0.35$. This perfect agreement confirms the consistency of the provided data. The problem requires the answer to be expressed as a unitless decimal rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $0.35$ is written as $0.350$ to satisfy this requirement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.350}$$", "id": "2497465"}]}
