Salvage pathways are negligible. The products analyzed are adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and guanosine monophosphate (GMP).\n- **Established Facts (to be used exclusively)**:\n    1.  Purine rings are assembled on 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP).\n    2.  Sources of atoms for the purine ring:\n        -   $N1$ derives from aspartate.\n        -   $N3$ and $N9$ derive from glutamine amide.\n        -   $C2$ and $C8$ derive from $\\mathrm{N}^{10}$-formyl-tetrahydrofolate (THF).\n        -   $C6$ derives from $\\mathrm{CO}_2$.\n        -   $C4$, $C5$, and $N7$ derive from glycine.\n    3.  Inosine monophosphate (IMP) is the common branchpoint precursor for both AMP and GMP.\n    4.  The pathway from IMP to AMP uses aspartate as the nitrogen donor for the exocyclic $N6$ amino group.\n    5.  The pathway from IMP to GMP uses glutamine amide as the nitrogen donor for the exocyclic $N2$ amino group.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem is evaluated against the required criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes the canonical *de novo* purine biosynthesis pathway, a cornerstone of molecular biology and biochemistry. The described origins of the atoms in the purine ring and the specific branching pathways from IMP to AMP and GMP are factually correct and universally accepted. The experimental design, using stable isotope pulse labeling, is a standard and valid method for tracing metabolic pathways.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a complete set of initial conditions (the labeled substrates) and a complete set of rules (the \"well-tested facts\") to follow. The question asks for a specific, predictable outcome based on these inputs, which allows for a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise, technical, and free of subjectivity. It defines the labeled positions on the precursor amino acids and asks for the resulting labeled positions on the products.\n- **Flaw Checklist**: The problem does not violate any of the specified flaw conditions. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, realistic, well-structured, and verifiable based on established biochemical principles. The instruction to use *only* the provided facts makes it a closed-system logic problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived based on the provided information.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe solution requires tracing the path of the $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ isotope from the two specified precursors into the final products, AMP and GMP. The analysis is divided into two parts: the synthesis of the common intermediate, IMP, and the subsequent branching to AMP and GMP.\n\n**Part 1: Labeling of the Common Precursor, Inosine Monophosphate (IMP)**\n\nThe purine ring of IMP is synthesized first and is common to both AMP and GMP. We analyze the incorporation of $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ into this ring structure under the two experimental conditions.\n\n-   **Condition 1: Feeding with $\\alpha$-amino-$^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ aspartate.**\n    -   According to the provided facts, the ring nitrogen $N1$ is derived from aspartate. In this reaction, the $\\alpha$-amino group of aspartate is the nitrogen source.\n    -   Therefore, feeding with $\\alpha$-amino-$^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ aspartate will result in the incorporation of $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ at position $N1$ of the purine ring.\n    -   Since IMP is the common precursor, all IMP molecules will be labeled at $N1$. Consequently, both AMP and GMP derived from this IMP pool will contain $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ at their $N1$ position.\n\n-   **Condition 2: Feeding with amido-$^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ glutamine.**\n    -   The provided facts state that ring nitrogens $N3$ and $N9$ are derived from the amide nitrogen of glutamine.\n    -   Therefore, feeding with amido-$^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ glutamine will result in the incorporation of $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ at both the $N3$ and $N9$ positions of the purine ring.\n    -   As before, this labeling will be present in the entire IMP pool and thus will be found in both AMP and GMP at positions $N3$ and $N9$.\n\n**Part 2: Labeling during the Conversion of IMP to AMP and GMP**\n\nThe pathways from IMP to AMP and GMP are separate and use different nitrogen donors for their exocyclic amino groups.\n\n-   **Synthesis of AMP from IMP**:\n    -   The provided facts state that the exocyclic amino group at position $N6$ of adenine (in AMP) is derived from aspartate. The reaction mechanism confirms that this is specifically the $\\alpha$-amino group of aspartate.\n    -   When feeding with $\\alpha$-amino-$^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ aspartate, this second incorporation step will label the exocyclic $N6$ position of AMP.\n    -   When feeding with amido-$^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ glutamine, the aspartate used in this step is unlabeled. Thus, the $N6$ of AMP will not be labeled.\n\n-   **Synthesis of GMP from IMP**:\n    -   The provided facts state that the exocyclic amino group at position $N2$ of guanine (in GMP) is derived from the amide nitrogen of glutamine.\n    -   When feeding with amido-$^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ glutamine, this incorporation step will label the exocyclic $N2$ position of GMP.\n    -   When feeding with $\\alpha$-amino-$^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ aspartate, the glutamine used in this step is unlabeled. Thus, the $N2$ of GMP will not be labeled.\n\n**Summary of Predictions**\n\n-   **Feeding with $\\alpha$-amino-$^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ aspartate**:\n    -   In both AMP and GMP: Ring nitrogen $N1$ is labeled.\n    -   In AMP only: Exocyclic nitrogen $N6$ is labeled.\n    -   No other nitrogens are labeled.\n-   **Feeding with amido-$^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ glutamine**:\n    -   In both AMP and GMP: Ring nitrogens $N3$ and $N9$ are labeled.\n    -   In GMP only: Exocyclic nitrogen $N2$ is labeled.\n    -   No other nitrogens are labeled.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nNow, we evaluate each option against this rigorously derived summary.\n\n**A. Feeding $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$-aspartate labels ring $N1$ in both AMP and GMP and labels the exocyclic $N6$ of AMP only; feeding amido-$^{15}\\mathrm{N}$-glutamine labels ring $N3$ and $N9$ in both AMP and GMP and labels the exocyclic $N2$ of GMP only.**\n-   This statement perfectly matches the derived predictions for both labeling experiments. The labeling of the common ring positions ($N1$ from aspartate; $N3$ and $N9$ from glutamine) is correctly identified as occurring in both final products. The specific labeling of the exocyclic amino groups ($N6$ of AMP from aspartate; $N2$ of GMP from glutamine) is also correctly described.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Feeding $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$-aspartate labels ring $N1$ and $N7$ of both AMP and GMP and labels the exocyclic $N2$ of GMP; feeding amido-$^{15}\\mathrm{N}$-glutamine labels ring $N3$ only in both nucleotides and labels the exocyclic $N6$ of AMP.**\n-   This statement contains multiple errors. $N7$ derives from glycine, not aspartate. The exocyclic $N2$ of GMP derives from glutamine, not aspartate. Amido-glutamine labels both $N3$ and $N9$, not just $N3$. The exocyclic $N6$ of AMP derives from aspartate, not glutamine.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Feeding $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$-aspartate labels only the exocyclic amino nitrogens ($N6$ in AMP and $N2$ in GMP), not any ring nitrogens; feeding amido-$^{15}\\mathrm{N}$-glutamine labels ring $N1$, $N3$, $N7$, and $N9$ in both nucleotides.**\n-   This statement is incorrect. It fails to account for the labeling of ring nitrogen $N1$ by aspartate. It incorrectly claims aspartate labels the $N2$ of GMP. It also incorrectly claims glutamine labels $N1$ and $N7$, which derive from aspartate and glycine, respectively.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Feeding $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$-aspartate labels ring $N1$ in AMP only (not GMP) because $N1$ arises after branching, whereas feeding amido-$^{15}\\mathrm{N}$-glutamine labels ring $N3$ and $N9$ in GMP only and labels the exocyclic $N2$ and $N6$ in both nucleotides.**\n-   This statement is fundamentally flawed in its reasoning. The synthesis of the purine ring, including the incorporation of $N1$, occurs *before* the branch point at IMP. Therefore, any label in the IMP ring will be present in both AMP and GMP. The claim that glutamine labels the exocyclic $N6$ of AMP is also false.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Feeding amido-$^{15}\\mathrm{N}$-glutamine labels ring $N9$ only in both nucleotides; feeding $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$-aspartate labels ring $N1$ and the exocyclic $N2$ in GMP only.**\n-   This statement is incorrect. Amido-glutamine labels both $N3$ and $N9$, not just $N9$. The claim about aspartate labeling is also wrong; the $N1$ label would appear in both AMP and GMP, and the exocyclic $N2$ of GMP is not derived from aspartate.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2515862"}, {"introduction": "A fundamental skill in microbiology is predicting the physiological consequences of a genetic mutation.

Assume the following well-tested facts as the fundamental base for your reasoning:\n\n- In de novo purine biosynthesis, the first committed step (amidophosphoribosyltransferase) uses glutamine as the amide donor to convert phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to phosphoribosylamine; additional glutamine-dependent steps include formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide synthetase and guanosine monophosphate (GMP) synthetase.\n- In de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase uses glutamine as the nitrogen source under physiological ammonium, and cytidine triphosphate (CTP) synthetase requires glutamine to aminate uridine triphosphate (UTP) to CTP.\n- Salvage pathways can convert exogenous ribonucleosides into nucleotides without requiring glutamine at the above de novo amide-donor steps, provided transporters and kinases/phosphoribosyltransferases are present.\n\nYou measure intracellular metabolites in the GS-null strain under these nitrogen-limited conditions and consider supplementing the medium with ribonucleosides.

The gene encoding the $ATP$-dependent enzyme for assimilating ammonium into glutamine from glutamate is deleted.\n- **Culture Conditions:** Carbon-excess, nitrogen-limited chemostat.\n- **Metabolic State:** Extracellular ammonium is low enough that glutamate dehydrogenase ($GDH$) activity does not supply appreciable glutamine.\n- **Fact 1 (De Novo Purine Biosynthesis):**\n    - Amidophosphoribosyltransferase uses glutamine to convert phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate ($PRPP$) to phosphoribosylamine.\n    - Formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide synthetase uses glutamine.\n    - Guanosine monophosphate ($GMP$) synthetase uses glutamine.\n- **Fact 2 (De Novo Pyrimidine Biosynthesis):**\n    - Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase uses glutamine as the nitrogen source.\n    - Cytidine triphosphate ($CTP$) synthetase requires glutamine to aminate uridine triphosphate ($UTP$) to $CTP$.\n- **Fact 3 (Salvage Pathways):**\n    - Exogenous ribonucleosides can be converted into nucleotides without requiring glutamine for the de novo amide-donor steps.\n    - This functionality is contingent on the presence of transporters and kinases/phosphoribosyltransferases.\n- **Question:** Predict the growth phenotype, qualitative pattern of intracellular metabolite pool changes, and the outcome of supplementing the medium with ribonucleosides for the $GS$-null strain under the specified conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement describes a classical metabolic knockout experiment.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The roles of glutamine as a primary nitrogen donor in nucleotide biosynthesis, the function of glutamine synthetase ($GS$), the existence of de novo and salvage pathways, and the concept of a chemostat are fundamental, well-established principles in biochemistry and microbiology. The premise is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined. The genetic modification ($GS$-null), the specific culture conditions (nitrogen-limitation, low ammonium), and the relevant biochemical pathways are explicitly stated. It asks for a prediction of observable phenomena (growth, metabolite levels) based on these facts, which allows for a unique and logical deduction.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. The crucial detail that glutamate dehydrogenase ($GDH$) cannot compensate for the loss of $GS$ is provided, which prevents ambiguity. The provided facts are consistent with known metabolic networks.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formulated question in metabolic physiology. A solution will be derived based on the provided principles.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe central defect in the `GS-null` strain is the inability to synthesize glutamine. The problem explicitly states that under the given nitrogen-limited, low-ammonium conditions, the alternative pathway via glutamate dehydrogenase ($GDH$) is insignificant. Therefore, the cell experiences acute glutamine starvation. Glutamine is a critical donor of amide groups for numerous biosynthetic reactions, including the synthesis of nucleotides, as detailed in the problem.\n\n1.  **Analysis of De Novo Purine Biosynthesis:**\n    The first committed step of de novo purine synthesis is the conversion of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate ($PRPP$) to phosphoribosylamine, a reaction catalyzed by amidophosphoribosyltransferase that requires glutamine as the nitrogen donor.\n    - **Consequence:** In the absence of glutamine, this reaction is blocked. $PRPP$ is continuously synthesized from ribose-$5$-phosphate but is not consumed by this major pathway. This leads to the **accumulation of intracellular $PRPP$**.\n    - Since the entry point into the pathway is blocked, the synthesis of all subsequent purine intermediates and final products, including inosine monophosphate ($IMP$), adenosine monophosphate ($AMP$), and guanosine monophosphate ($GMP$), will be severely inhibited. Consequently, the total intracellular pools of purine nucleotides (e.g., $ATP$, $GTP$) will **dramatically decrease**.\n\n2.  **Analysis of De Novo Pyrimidine Biosynthesis:**\n    Two key glutamine-dependent steps are mentioned:\n    - Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase: This block impairs the synthesis of the pyrimidine ring itself, leading to a general shortage of pyrimidine nucleotides.\n    - $CTP$ synthetase: This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of uridine triphosphate ($UTP$) to cytidine triphosphate ($CTP$), using glutamine as the amide donor.\n    - **Consequence:** The block at $CTP$ synthetase is a direct impediment to the conversion of an existing nucleotide pool. $UTP$ is the substrate for a blocked reaction. Thus, $UTP$ will accumulate relative to its product, $CTP$. This means the intracellular **ratio of $UTP$ to $CTP$ will increase significantly**.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Cellular Growth:**\n    Nucleotides ($ATP$, $GTP$, $CTP$, $UTP$, and their deoxy- forms) are the monomeric units for DNA and RNA synthesis, essential for cell replication. $ATP$ is also the primary energy currency. A severe deficit in both purine and pyrimidine nucleotides will halt nucleic acid synthesis and cripple energy metabolism.\n    - **Consequence:** The `GS-null` strain will exhibit **severely slowed or arrested growth**.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Supplementation:**\n    The problem states that salvage pathways can convert exogenous ribonucleosides (adenosine, guanosine, uridine, cytidine) into their respective mononucleotides ($AMP$, $GMP$, $UMP$, $CMP$). These salvage reactions bypass the glutamine-dependent steps of the de novo pathways.\n    - To restore growth, the cell must replenish its pools of all necessary nucleotides. This requires both purines (A and G) and pyrimidines (C and U/T).\n    - **Consequence:** Supplying a **balanced mixture of all four ribonucleosides** (adenosine, guanosine, uridine, and cytidine) should circumvent the metabolic blocks and allow for the synthesis of all required nucleotides, thus **markedly improving or restoring growth**.\n    - Supplying only a **single nucleoside**, or an incomplete mixture, will only partially alleviate the deficiency. For example, supplying only pyrimidines will not fix the purine deficit. Therefore, supplementation with any single nucleoside can provide at best only a **partial rescue**, as growth will then be limited by the lack of the other nucleotides.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\nBased on the derivation above, each option is now evaluated.\n\n**A. The strain shows severely slowed growth; intracellular PRPP rises, total purine nucleotide pools drop, and the UTP to CTP ratio increases. Growth is markedly improved by supplying a balanced mixture of adenosine, guanosine, uridine, and cytidine; any single nucleoside provides only partial rescue.**\n- **Growth Phenotype:** \"severely slowed growth\" is correct.\n- **Metabolite Pools:** \"$PRPP$ rises\" is correct. \"total purine nucleotide pools drop\" is correct. \"the $UTP$ to $CTP$ ratio increases\" is correct.\n- **Supplementation:** \"Growth is markedly improved by supplying a balanced mixture\" is correct. \"any single nucleoside provides only partial rescue\" is correct.\nThis option provides a complete and accurate description of all predicted consequences.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The strain grows at near wild-type rates; intracellular metabolite pools remain essentially unchanged, and exogenous nucleosides have no measurable effect on growth.**\nThis statement implies the $GS$ knockout is inconsequential, which contradicts the fundamental role of glutamine in biosynthesis and the problem's premise that the $GDH$ bypass is inactive.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The strain shows severely slowed growth; intracellular PRPP falls, inosine monophosphate (IMP) and xanthosine monophosphate (XMP) accumulate, and CTP increases relative to UTP. Growth is fully restored by cytidine alone.**\nThis option contains multiple errors:\n- \"$PRPP$ falls\": Incorrect. It is the substrate of a blocked reaction and should rise.\n- \"$IMP$ and $XMP$ accumulate\": Incorrect. These are downstream products of a blocked pathway and should be depleted.\n- \"$CTP$ increases relative to $UTP$\": Incorrect. The $UTP \\to CTP$ conversion is blocked, so the substrate ($UTP$) increases relative to the product ($CTP$).\n- \"fully restored by cytidine alone\": Incorrect. This neglects the critical requirement for purines.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The strain arrests growth completely; intracellular PRPP rises, IMP rises, and UTP falls. Growth is fully restored by guanosine plus cytidine, whereas adenosine and uridine are ineffective.**\nThis option also contains multiple errors:\n- \"$IMP$ rises\": Incorrect. It is downstream of the primary block and should be depleted.\n- \"$UTP$ falls\": Incorrect. $UTP$ is a substrate for the blocked $CTP$ synthetase reaction and would be expected to accumulate relative to $CTP$. A general fall in all nucleotide pools is possible, but an increase in the $UTP/CTP$ ratio is the more specific and certain outcome. The simple statement \"$UTP$ falls\" is misleading and likely incorrect in a relative sense.\n- \"fully restored by guanosine plus cytidine\": Incorrect. Cells require both adenosine and guanosine for purine synthesis, and both uridine and cytidine for pyrimidine needs. This incomplete mixture cannot fully restore growth.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThe only option that aligns with a rigorous analysis based on the provided biochemical principles is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2515830"}, {"introduction": "Metabolic pathways are not static routes but dynamically regulated networks that respond to the cell's needs.

For example: $[J_1,J_2,J_3,J_4,S_1,S_2,S_3,S_4]$.", "solution": "The problem requires the formulation and implementation of a kinetic model to compute the steady-state flux of de novo purine biosynthesis, denoted $J^*$, and its sensitivity to the concentration of adenosine triphosphate, $S = \\frac{dJ^*}{d[ATP]}$. The model is constructed upon fundamental principles of enzyme kinetics and metabolic regulation, specifically focusing on two key enzymatic steps. The solution is derived through a systematic, multi-step computational procedure.\n\nFirst, it is necessary to determine the concentrations of adenosine diphosphate, $[ADP]$, and adenosine monophosphate, $[AMP]$, for any given concentration of $[ATP]$ within a fixed total adenylate pool, $A_{tot}$. This is governed by two fundamental relationships:\n$1$. The conservation of the total adenylate pool:\n$$ A_{tot} = [ATP] + [ADP] + [AMP] $$\n$2$. The adenylate kinase equilibrium, which is assumed to be rapid: $ATP + AMP \\rightleftharpoons 2 ADP$. This is described by the equilibrium constant $K_{eq}$:\n$$ K_{eq} = \\frac{[ADP]^2}{[ATP][AMP]} \\implies [ATP][AMP] = K_{eq}[ADP]^2 $$\nBy substituting $[AMP] = A_{tot} - [ATP] - [ADP]$ into the equilibrium expression, we obtain a quadratic equation for $[ADP]$. Let $x$ represent $[ADP]$:\n$$ [ATP](A_{tot} - [ATP] - x) = K_{eq}x^2 $$\nRearranging this into standard form gives:\n$$ K_{eq}x^2 + [ATP]x - [ATP](A_{tot} - [ATP]) = 0 $$\nThe physiologically meaningful solution for $[ADP]$ is the positive root of this equation, which is found using the quadratic formula:\n$$ [ADP] = \\frac{-[ATP] + \\sqrt{[ATP]^2 - 4(K_{eq})(-[ATP](A_{tot} - [ATP]))}}{2 K_{eq}} $$\nOnce $[ADP]$ is computed, $[AMP]$ is determined by the conservation equation.\n\nWith the concentrations of all three adenylates known, we can calculate the adenylate energy charge, $EC$. This is a standard measure of the energetic state of the cell, defined as:\n$$ EC = \\frac{[ATP] + 0.5 [ADP]}{[ATP] + [ADP] + [AMP]} = \\frac{[ATP] + 0.5 [ADP]}{A_{tot}} $$\n\nThe steady-state flux of the pathway, $J^*$, is determined under a pseudo-steady-state assumption for the intermediate phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate, $[PRPP]$. This implies that the rate of production of $[PRPP]$ by PRPP synthetase, $v_1$, is equal to its rate of consumption by glutamine-PRPP amidotransferase (PurF), $v_2$. The pathway flux is therefore $J^* = v_1 = v_2$. The problem provides the rate law for $v_1$:\n$$ v_1 = V_{1,\\max} \\cdot \\frac{[R5P]}{K_{m,R5P} + [R5P]} \\cdot \\frac{[ATP]}{K_{m,ATP1} + [ATP]} \\cdot \\frac{EC^{n}}{EC_{50}^{n} + EC^{n}} $$\nThis equation shows that the flux is a function of substrate concentrations ($[R5P]$, $[ATP]$) and is allosterically activated by the energy charge via a cooperative Hill-type mechanism. Since all parameters and concentrations on the right-hand side are known or have been calculated, we can directly compute $v_1$, and thus $J^*$. For a physically valid steady state to exist, the production rate $v_1$ must not exceed the maximal possible consumption rate, $V_{2,\\text{eff}}$. This condition, $v_1 < V_{2,\\text{eff}}$, where $V_{2,\\text{eff}} = \\frac{V_{2,\\max}}{1 + [AMP]/K_{i,AMP}}$, must be satisfied. The problem structure implies this holds true for the given parameters.\n\nFinally, we compute the sensitivity $S = \\frac{dJ^*}{d[ATP]}$. An analytical derivative is complex due to the nested dependencies ($J^*$ on $EC$, $EC$ on $[ADP]$, and $[ADP]$ on $[ATP]$). Therefore, a numerical approach is dictated. We use a finite-difference approximation with a small perturbation $\\delta$ to $[ATP]$. The central difference formula provides a robust, second-order accurate approximation for points not at the boundary of the feasible concentration range ($0 < [ATP] < A_{tot}$):\n$$ S \\approx \\frac{J^*([ATP] + \\delta) - J^*([ATP] - \\delta)}{2\\delta} $$\nThe evaluation of this expression requires computing the flux $J^*$ at two perturbed concentrations, $[ATP] + \\delta$ and $[ATP] - \\delta$, using the same procedure described above. The problem specifies the use of one-sided forward or backward differences if the central difference stencil would extend outside the valid domain $[0, A_{tot}]$, although for the given test cases, the central difference is always applicable.\n\nThe overall algorithm for each test case is as follows:\n$1$. Given a value for $[ATP]$, calculate $[ADP]$ and $[AMP]$.\n$2$. Calculate the energy charge $EC$.\n$3$. Calculate the steady-state flux $J^* = v_1$.\n$4$. To find the sensitivity $S$, repeat steps $1$-$3$ for $[ATP]+\\delta$ and $[ATP]-\\delta$ to find $J^*([ATP]+\\delta)$ and $J^*([ATP]-\\delta)$.\n$5$. Apply the central difference formula to approximate $S$.\n$6$. The results $J^*$ and $S$ are rounded to the specified precision.
