The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the specified criteria for invalidity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the fraction of bacteria that have experienced at least one phage adsorption event by time $t$. We are told that for a single bacterium, phage encounters are described by a Poisson process. The core of the problem is to determine the rate parameter of this process.\n\nThe overall rate of adsorption events per unit volume in the culture is given by the law of mass action:\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{\\text{volume}} = kBP $$\nThis rate has units of events per milliliter per minute. To find the rate of adsorption events for a single bacterium, we must divide this volumetric rate by the concentration of bacteria, $B$. This gives the average rate per bacterium. Let us denote this rate parameter by $\\lambda$.\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{\\text{Rate}_{\\text{volume}}}{B} = \\frac{kBP}{B} = kP $$\nThis is the rate parameter (or instantaneous hazard) for the Poisson process modeling phage adsorption onto a single bacterium. The units of $\\lambda$ are $\\text{min}^{-1}$, which is correct for a rate. The problem states that phage and bacteria concentrations are constant over the short timescale, so $\\lambda$ is constant.\n\nLet $N(t)$ be the random variable representing the number of phages that have adsorbed to a single bacterium by time $t$. According to the problem statement, $N(t)$ follows a Poisson distribution with a mean $\\mu$ equal to the rate parameter multiplied by the time interval:\n$$ \\mu = \\lambda t = kPt $$\nThe probability mass function for a Poisson-distributed random variable $N(t)$ is:\n$$ \\text{Prob}(N(t) = n) = \\frac{\\mu^n e^{-\\mu}}{n!} = \\frac{(kPt)^n \\exp(-kPt)}{n!} $$\nwhere $n$ is the number of adsorption events ($n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$).\n\nWe are interested in the fraction of bacteria that have experienced *at least one* adsorption event. For a single bacterium, this is the probability that $N(t) \\ge 1$. It is more direct to calculate the complementary probability, which is the probability of experiencing zero events, $\\text{Prob}(N(t)=0)$, and subtract it from $1$.\n$$ \\text{Prob}(N(t) \\ge 1) = 1 - \\text{Prob}(N(t) = 0) $$\nUsing the Poisson probability mass function for $n=0$:\n$$ \\text{Prob}(N(t) = 0) = \\frac{(kPt)^0 \\exp(-kPt)}{0!} = \\exp(-kPt) $$\nsince $x^0 = 1$ and $0! = 1$.\n\nThus, the probability that a single bacterium has undergone at least one adsorption event is:\n$$ \\text{Prob}(N(t) \\ge 1) = 1 - \\exp(-kPt) $$\nBecause the system is well-mixed and the bacteria are considered independent, this probability is equal to the expected fraction of the total bacterial population that has experienced at least one adsorption. Let this fraction be $F(t)$. The derived expression is:\n$$ F(t) = 1 - \\exp(-kPt) $$\nNow, we must evaluate this expression at $t = 5\\ \\text{min}$ using the given parameters.

The lambda repressor protein (CI; encoded by the $cI$ gene) binds with highest intrinsic affinity to $O_R1$, next to $O_R2$, and lowest to $O_R3$, and exhibits cooperative interactions between $O_R1$ and $O_R2$. Occupancy of $O_R1$ and $O_R2$ by $CI$ represses $P_R$ and activates $P_{RM}$ through protein–protein contacts with ribonucleic acid polymerase (RNAP). At elevated $[CI]$, binding to $O_R3$ represses $P_{RM}$ (negative autoregulation) by occluding RNAP binding. The Cro protein ($Cro$) binds $O_R3$ with relatively high affinity and represses $P_{RM}$ early during lytic growth.\n\nConsider a quasi-equilibrium thermodynamic promoter-occupancy framework in which the probability that $P_{RM}$ is transcriptionally active, $P_{\\text{on}}(P_{RM})$, is proportional to a sum over statistical weights of microstates in which RNAP is bound to $P_{RM}$ and not sterically occluded by operator occupancy. Each microstate has statistical weight proportional to $\\exp(-\\beta \\Delta G_{\\text{state}})$ multiplied by appropriate powers of free concentrations (for example $[CI]^n$) reflecting the number $n$ of bound repressors, with $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is absolute temperature. Assume cooperative interactions between $CI$ at $O_R1$ and $O_R2$ lower the free energy of states containing both sites occupied, thereby enhancing $P_{RM}$ activation, and that $CI$ occupancy of $O_R3$ disallows RNAP at $P_{RM}$.\n\nNow imagine a mutant in which the $O_R3$ site is deleted (precisely removing the $CI$ and $Cro$ binding site without altering $O_R1$, $O_R2$, or core promoter sequences). Using promoter occupancy arguments as above, reason qualitatively about how this deletion changes:\n- the functional dependence of $P_{RM}$-driven $CI$ expression on $[CI]$, especially its maximal level and whether it remains monotonic versus $[CI]$;\n- the dynamic range of $CI$ expression (interpreted as the ratio of maximal to minimal $P_{RM}$ output over the range of $[CI]$ that is physiologically accessible in the lysogenic state);\n- the switch’s susceptibility to induction into the lytic cycle by perturbations that transiently reduce $[CI]$ (for example, self-cleavage of $CI$ upon DNA damage), in terms of how easily the system can cross the threshold at which $P_R$ is derepressed and $P_{RM}$ fails to maintain $CI$.\n\nWhich statement best captures the predicted effects of the $O_R3$ deletion?\n\nA. Deleting $O_R3$ removes negative autoregulation, making $P_{RM}$ activation by $CI$ a monotonic nondecreasing function of $[CI]$ that saturates at a higher maximal level; the dynamic range of $CI$ expression increases; the lysogenic state becomes less susceptible to induction because a larger decrement in $[CI]$ is required to drop $P_{RM}$ output below maintenance.\n\nB. Deleting $O_R3$ removes positive feedback, making $P_{RM}$ activation by $CI$ a monotonic decreasing function of $[CI]$; the dynamic range of $CI$ expression decreases; the lysogenic state becomes more susceptible to induction because $P_{RM}$ is more easily shut off.\n\nC. Deleting $O_R3$ removes negative autoregulation, increasing the maximal $P_{RM}$ output, but this also increases susceptibility to induction because higher $P_{RM}$ causes larger noise; overall the dynamic range increases while the lysogenic state becomes more easily induced.\n\nD.

The thermodynamic model is a standard and powerful framework for analyzing such systems.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It defines a wild-type system, a specific perturbation (deletion of $O_R3$), and asks for the qualitative consequences within the given theoretical framework. The information provided is sufficient to deduce a unique qualitative outcome.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is precise, technical, and free from subjective bias.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, logically consistent, and well-posed. There are no identifiable flaws. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe analysis will proceed by first characterizing the wild-type system and then the mutant system, based on the provided thermodynamic framework. The rate of $CI$ expression is proportional to the probability that the $P_{RM}$ promoter is active, denoted $P_{\\text{on}}(P_{RM})$.\n\n**1. Wild-Type ($WT$) System Behavior**\n\nThe activity of the $P_{RM}$ promoter is a function of the concentration of the CI repressor, $[CI]$.\n- At very low $[CI]$ (near $[CI] \\approx 0$), the operators are unoccupied. $P_{RM}$ is a weak promoter with low basal activity.\n- As $[CI]$ increases, CI begins to occupy the highest affinity site, $O_R1$. Due to cooperativity, this facilitates the binding of a second CI dimer to $O_R2$. The problem states that \"Occupancy of $O_R1$ and $O_R2$ by $CI$ ... activates $P_{RM}$\". This positive feedback causes $P_{\\text{on}}(P_{RM})$ to increase with $[CI]$.\n- At elevated $[CI]$, CI begins to occupy the lowest affinity site, $O_R3$. The problem states that binding to $O_R3$ \"represses $P_{RM}$... by occluding RNAP binding\". This constitutes a negative autoregulatory loop.\n- The combination of these effects results in a non-monotonic relationship between $P_{\\text{on}}(P_{RM})$ and $[CI]$. The function initially rises due to activation via $O_R1/O_R2$ binding, reaches a maximum, and then decreases at high $[CI]$ due to repression via $O_R3$ binding. This produces a characteristic bell-shaped response curve. The stable lysogenic state is maintained at a $[CI]$ value near the peak of this curve, where a homeostatic effect is achieved: if $[CI]$ increases slightly, $P_{RM}$ activity drops, reducing CI production; if $[CI]$ decreases slightly (while remaining on the right side of the peak), $P_{RM}$ activity rises, increasing CI production.\n\n**2. Mutant ($\\Delta O_R3$) System Behavior**\n\nNow consider the mutant where the $O_R3$ site is deleted.\n- The deletion of $O_R3$ physically removes the site responsible for negative autoregulation at high $[CI]$. The repressive action of CI on $P_{RM}$ is eliminated.\n- The activation machinery remains intact. CI can still bind to $O_R1$ and $O_R2$, activating transcription from $P_{RM}$.\n- Consequently, as $[CI]$ increases from zero, $P_{\\text{on}}(P_{RM})$ will increase due to cooperative binding at $O_R1/O_R2$. However, unlike the wild-type, it will not decrease at higher $[CI]$. Instead, the activity will continue to rise until it reaches a saturation point, where $O_R1$ and $O_R2$ are fully occupied and the promoter is maximally activated.\n- The functional dependence of $P_{RM}$ on $[CI]$ changes from a non-monotonic, bell-shaped curve to a monotonic, nondecreasing sigmoidal (saturating) curve.\n\n**3. Answering the Specific Questions**\n\n- **Functional Dependence and Maximal Level**: The function $P_{\\text{on}}(P_{RM})$ versus $[CI]$ becomes monotonic nondecreasing. The maximal level of $P_{RM}$ activity in the mutant will be higher than the peak activity in the wild-type. This is because the wild-type peak is a balance between activation and incipient repression, whereas the mutant's maximum is limited only by the saturation of the activation mechanism.\n- **Dynamic Range**: The dynamic range can be defined as the ratio of maximal to minimal $P_{RM}$ output, $P_{\\text{on}}^{\\text{max}} / P_{\\text{on}}^{\\text{min}}$. The minimal output, $P_{\\text{on}}^{\\text{min}}$, corresponding to the basal activity at $[CI]=0$, is unchanged. Since the maximal output, $P_{\\text{on}}^{\\text{max}}$, is higher in the mutant, the dynamic range is increased.\n- **Susceptibility to Induction**: Induction into the lytic cycle occurs when $[CI]$ drops below a critical threshold, leading to derepression of $P_R$. The stability of the lysogen is its ability to resist such a drop. In the wild-type, the negative feedback loop maintains $[CI]$ within a specific, optimal range. In the $\\Delta O_R3$ mutant, the absence of negative feedback means that the stable steady state of the lysogen will occur at a much higher $[CI]$, corresponding to the saturation of the $P_{RM}$ promoter. To induce the lytic cycle (i.e., to deplete CI below the switching threshold), a much larger or more prolonged perturbation (such as CI cleavage) is required to overcome this significantly larger reservoir of CI protein. Therefore, the lysogenic state becomes more stable, or *less* susceptible to induction.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n- **A. Deleting $O_R3$ removes negative autoregulation, making $P_{RM}$ activation by $CI$ a monotonic nondecreasing function of $[CI]$ that saturates at a higher maximal level; the dynamic range of $CI$ expression increases; the lysogenic state becomes less susceptible to induction because a larger decrement in $[CI]$ is required to drop $P_{RM}$ output below maintenance.**\nThis statement is a precise summary of our derived conclusions. Each point is correct: removal of negative autoregulation, change to monotonic function, higher maximum, increased dynamic range, and decreased susceptibility to induction (increased stability).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. Deleting $O_R3$ removes positive feedback, making $P_{RM}$ activation by $CI$ a monotonic decreasing function of $[CI]$; the dynamic range of $CI$ expression decreases; the lysogenic state becomes more susceptible to induction because $P_{RM}$ is more easily shut off.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. Deleting $O_R3$ removes *negative* feedback, not positive feedback. The resulting function is monotonic *increasing* (nondecreasing), not decreasing. All subsequent conclusions are based on these incorrect premises.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. Deleting $O_R3$ removes negative autoregulation, increasing the maximal $P_{RM}$ output, but this also increases susceptibility to induction because higher $P_{RM}$ causes larger noise; overall the dynamic range increases while the lysogenic state becomes more easily induced.**\nThis statement correctly identifies the removal of negative autoregulation and the increase in maximal output and dynamic range. However, it incorrectly concludes that susceptibility to induction *increases*. The reasoning provided (\"larger noise\") is a secondary effect that is overwhelmed by the primary effect of a much larger steady-state concentration of CI, which acts as a buffer. The dominant effect is increased stability.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. Deleting $O_R3$ does not alter the shape of $P_{RM}$ versus $[CI]$ because $O_R3$ is a low-affinity site; the dynamic range is unchanged; the susceptibility to induction is unchanged.**\nThis statement misunderstands the role of the low-affinity $O_R3$ site. Its low affinity is precisely what allows it to function as a sensor for high concentrations of CI, thereby mediating negative autoregulation and creating the non-monotonic shape. Deleting it fundamentally alters the curve's shape. Consequently, the dynamic range and stability are also altered.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThe only option that is fully consistent with a rigorous analysis of the lambda switch model is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2477681"}, {"introduction": "The ability of the lambda phage to commit to either a lytic or lysogenic pathway relies on the principle of bistability, where the underlying genetic circuit can settle into one of two stable states.

It is a standard, well-posed problem in mathematical biology that is scientifically grounded and formally specified. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution is derived by following the specified procedure of analyzing the stability of the symmetric fixed point.\n\n**i. Characterization of the Symmetric Fixed Point**\n\nA fixed point $(x^*, y^*)$ of the system is a point where the time derivatives are zero: $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0$. This leads to the nullcline equations:\n$$ x^* = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+(y^*)^n} $$\n$$ y^* = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+(x^*)^n} $$\nThe problem asks to analyze the symmetric fixed point, which is characterized by the condition $x^* = y^*$. Let $x^* = y^* = z$. Substituting this into either equation gives the condition for the symmetric fixed point:\n$$ z = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+z^n} $$\nThis can be rewritten as $\\alpha = z(1+z^n)$. This equation relates the steady-state concentration $z$ of the symmetric state to the parameter $\\alpha$ for a given $n$.\n\n**ii. Stability Analysis via the Jacobian Matrix**\n\nTo analyze the stability of this fixed point, we perform a linear stability analysis. The system is defined by the functions:\n$$ f(x,y) = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+y^n} - x $$\n$$ g(x,y) = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+x^n} - y $$\nThe Jacobian matrix $J$ of the system is given by:\n$$ J(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe compute the partial derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -1 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( \\alpha(1+y^n)^{-1} \\right) = \\alpha(-1)(1+y^n)^{-2}(ny^{n-1}) = -\\frac{\\alpha n y^{n-1}}{(1+y^n)^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\alpha(1+x^n)^{-1} \\right) = -\\frac{\\alpha n x^{n-1}}{(1+x^n)^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = -1 $$\nNow, we evaluate the Jacobian at the symmetric fixed point $(z,z)$:\n$$ J(z,z) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -\\frac{\\alpha n z^{n-1}}{(1+z^n)^2} \\\\ -\\frac{\\alpha n z^{n-1}}{(1+z^n)^2} & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe stability of the fixed point is determined by the eigenvalues of this matrix. A bifurcation occurs when the real part of at least one eigenvalue becomes positive. The characteristic equation is $\\det(J-\\lambda I)=0$:\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1-\\lambda & -\\frac{\\alpha n z^{n-1}}{(1+z^n)^2} \\\\ -\\frac{\\alpha n z^{n-1}}{(1+z^n)^2} & -1-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\n$$ (-1-\\lambda)^2 - \\left( \\frac{\\alpha n z^{n-1}}{(1+z^n)^2} \\right)^2 = 0 $$\nLet $k = \\frac{\\alpha n z^{n-1}}{(1+z^n)^2}$. The equation becomes $(1+\\lambda)^2 - k^2 = 0$, which gives $(1+\\lambda-k)(1+\\lambda+k)=0$. The eigenvalues are:\n$$ \\lambda_1 = -1+k $$\n$$ \\lambda_2 = -1-k $$\nSince $\\alpha > 0$, $n>1$, and $z \\ge 0$, the term $k$ is non-negative ($k \\ge 0$). Thus, $\\lambda_2 = -1-k \\le -1$, which is always negative. Stability is therefore determined entirely by $\\lambda_1$. The fixed point is stable if $\\lambda_1 < 0$ (i.e., $k<1$) and unstable if $\\lambda_1 > 0$ (i.e., $k>1$).\n\n**iii. Identification of the Bifurcation Condition**\n\nA symmetry-breaking bifurcation (in this case, a pitchfork bifurcation) occurs precisely when the stability changes, which is when $\\lambda_1 = 0$. This corresponds to the condition $k=1$.\n$$ \\frac{\\alpha n z^{n-1}}{(1+z^n)^2} = 1 $$\nThis is the condition for the bifurcation. At the bifurcation point, both this condition and the fixed point condition must be satisfied simultaneously. We have a system of two equations for the critical parameter value $\\alpha_c$ and the corresponding fixed point concentration $z_c$:\n1. Fixed point condition: $\\alpha_c = z_c(1+z_c^n)$\n2. Bifurcation condition: $\\frac{\\alpha_c n z_c^{n-1}}{(1+z_c^n)^2} = 1$\n\nTo find $\\alpha_c(n)$, we first solve for $z_c$ by substituting the expression for $\\alpha_c$ from equation (1) into equation (2):\n$$ \\frac{ [z_c(1+z_c^n)] n z_c^{n-1} }{ (1+z_c^n)^2 } = 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{n z_c^n (1+z_c^n)}{(1+z_c^n)^2} = 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{n z_c^n}{1+z_c^n} = 1 $$\nSolving for $z_c^n$:\n$$ n z_c^n = 1+z_c^n $$\n$$ (n-1)z_c^n = 1 $$\n$$ z_c^n = \\frac{1}{n-1} $$\nSince $n>1$ is given, $n-1 > 0$, and we find the positive real root for $z_c$:\n$$ z_c = \\left( \\frac{1}{n-1} \\right)^{1/n} = (n-1)^{-1/n} $$\nFinally, we substitute these expressions for $z_c$ and $z_c^n$ back into the fixed point equation for $\\alpha_c$:\n$$ \\alpha_c(n) = z_c(1+z_c^n) = (n-1)^{-1/n} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{n-1} \\right) $$\nSimplifying the term in the parenthesis:\n$$ 1 + \\frac{1}{n-1} = \\frac{n-1+1}{n-1} = \\frac{n}{n-1} $$\nSubstituting this back gives the expression for $\\alpha_c(n)$:\n$$ \\alpha_c(n) = (n-1)^{-1/n} \\left( \\frac{n}{n-1} \\right) = n (n-1)^{-1} (n-1)^{-1/n} $$\nCombining the exponents yields the final closed-form expression:\n$$ \\alpha_c(n) = n(n-1)^{-(1+1/n)} = n(n-1)^{-(n+1)/n} $$\nThis is the exact analytic expression for the critical value of $\\alpha$ at which the symmetric equilibrium loses stability.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{n(n-1)^{-(n+1)/n}} $$", "id": "2477646"}]}
