The concept of a triangulation number $T$, the existence of pentameric and hexameric capsomers, and the use of Euler's characteristic for spherical topology are all standard principles in structural virology. The triangulation number $T=28$ is a valid number in the allowed series $T = h^2 + hk + k^2$ (for integers $h, k$; e.g., $h=4, k=2$ yields $16+8+4=28$). The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and constraints for a unique solution to be derived from first principles. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any criteria for invalidity; it is self-contained, consistent, and scientifically sound.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation begins with Euler's formula for a convex polyhedron, or any graph tiling a sphere:\n$$V - E + F = \\chi = 2$$\nwhere $V$ is the number of vertices, $E$ is the number of edges, $F$ is the number of faces, and $\\chi=2$ is the Euler characteristic of a sphere. In this context, the capsomers are the faces of a polyhedron. We denote the number of pentameric capsomers as $N_p$ and the number of hexameric capsomers as $N_h$.\nThe total number of faces is the sum of the number of capsomers:\n$$F = N_p + N_h$$\nEach edge of this polyhedron represents the boundary between two adjacent capsomers. We can count the total number of edges by summing the sides of all faces and dividing by $2$, since each edge is shared. Pentamers have $5$ sides and hexamers have $6$.\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2}(5 N_p + 6 N_h)$$\nThe problem states the tiling is trivalent, meaning three capsomers meet at each vertex. Thus, each vertex has a degree of $3$. According to the handshaking lemma, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges:\n$$3V = 2E \\implies V = \\frac{2}{3}E$$\nNow substitute the expressions for $V$ and $F$ into Euler's formula:\n$$\\left(\\frac{2}{3}E\\right) - E + (N_p + N_h) = 2$$\n$$-\\frac{1}{3}E + N_p + N_h = 2$$\nSubstitute the expression for $E$:\n$$-\\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(5 N_p + 6 N_h)\\right) + N_p + N_h = 2$$\n$$-\\frac{1}{6}(5 N_p + 6 N_h) + N_p + N_h = 2$$\n$$-\\frac{5}{6}N_p - N_h + N_p + N_h = 2$$\n$$\\left(1 - \\frac{5}{6}\\right)N_p + (1 - 1)N_h = 2$$\n$$\\frac{1}{6}N_p = 2$$\n$$N_p = 12$$\nThis result is a topological constant for any closed icosahedral shell composed of pentamers and hexamers. The number of pentameric capsomers is always $12$, independent of the triangulation number $T$.\nThe general expression for the number of pentameric capsomers as a function of $T$ is therefore:\n$$N_p(T) = 12$$\nNext, we derive the expression for the number of hexameric capsomers, $N_h$. The total number of major capsid protein (MCP) subunits, $N_{MCP}$, in a Caspar-Klug capsid with triangulation number $T$ is given by the fundamental relation:\n$$N_{MCP} = 60T$$\nThis total number of subunits is also the sum of subunits from all capsomers. Since the protein is a single species, pentamers are composed of $5$ MCPs and hexamers are composed of $6$ MCPs.\n$$N_{MCP} = 5N_p + 6N_h$$\nEquating the two expressions for $N_{MCP}$:\n$$60T = 5N_p + 6N_h$$\nWe have already proven that $N_p=12$. Substituting this value:\n$$60T = 5(12) + 6N_h$$\n$$60T = 60 + 6N_h$$\n$$6N_h = 60T - 60$$\n$$N_h = 10(T-1)$$\nThis is the general expression for the number of hexameric capsomers as a function of $T$.\n\nNow, we compute these quantities for the specified triangulation number, $T=28$:\nThe number of pentameric capsomers is constant:\n$$N_p = 12$$\nThe number of hexameric capsomers is:\n$$N_h = 10(28-1) = 10(27) = 270$$\nFinally, we determine the total number of quasi-equivalent MCP subunits, $N_{MCP}$, using the capsomer stoichiometry as requested.\n$$N_{MCP} = 5N_p + 6N_h$$\n$$N_{MCP} = 5(12) + 6(270)$$\n$$N_{MCP} = 60 + 1620$$\n$$N_{MCP} = 1680$$\nThis result is consistent with the formula $N_{MCP} = 60T$, as $60 \\times 28 = 1680$.\n\nThe three requested quantities, in the specified order (total MCP subunits, number of pentameric capsomers, number of hexameric capsomers), are $1680$, $12$, and $270$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1680 & 12 & 270\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2474671"}, {"introduction": "A viral capsid must not only protect the genome but also contain it within an incredibly small volume, leading to extreme internal pressures and DNA condensation states.

It is scientifically grounded in the biophysics of viruses, well-posed, and objective. It provides all necessary parameters to perform a calculation based on an explicitly stated physical model. The term \"excluded volume of the DNA cylinder\" could be seen as ambiguous. In polymer physics, excluded volume is a concept related to the interaction between two or more polymer segments. However, for a single object, the volume it \"excludes\" to others is simply its own volume. Given the context of calculating a packing fraction, the most logical and standard interpretation is that \"excluded volume\" is used as a synonym for the geometric volume occupied by the DNA molecule. To assume a more complex polymer physics definition would require additional, unstated parameters and would be inconsistent with the simplicity of the rest of the model. Therefore, the problem is solvable under this reasonable interpretation. The fact that the given parameters might lead to a physically questionable result (e.g., a volume fraction greater than $1$) is not a flaw in the problem's formulation, but rather a potential outcome of the specified model, which we are obligated to follow. The problem asks for an estimation based on the given assumptions, not for a confirmation of physical possibility.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the average DNA volume fraction, $\\phi$, defined as the ratio of the DNA volume to the capsid's internal volume.\n\nFirst, the total length of the dsDNA genome, $L_{DNA}$, is calculated. The genome contains $27\\,\\mathrm{kb}$, which is $27 \\times 10^3$ base pairs. The axial rise per base pair is given as $h_{bp} = 0.34\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\nThe total contour length of the DNA is therefore:\n$$L_{DNA} = (27 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{bp}) \\times (0.34\\,\\mathrm{nm/bp}) = 9180\\,\\mathrm{nm}$$\n\nNext, the volume of the DNA genome, $V_{DNA}$, is calculated by modeling it as a hard cylinder. The volume of a cylinder is its cross-sectional area multiplied by its length. The diameter is given as $d_{DNA} = 2\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, which corresponds to a radius of $r_{DNA} = d_{DNA}/2 = 1\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n$$V_{DNA} = (\\pi r_{DNA}^2) \\times L_{DNA} = \\pi (1\\,\\mathrm{nm})^2 \\times (9180\\,\\mathrm{nm}) = 9180\\pi\\,\\mathrm{nm}^3$$\n\nThen, the volume of the capsid interior, $V_{capsid}$, is calculated. The interior is modeled as a sphere with a given internal radius $R = 18\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. The volume of a sphere is given by the formula $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$.\n$$V_{capsid} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (18\\,\\mathrm{nm})^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (5832\\,\\mathrm{nm}^3) = 7776\\pi\\,\\mathrm{nm}^3$$\n\nFinally, the average DNA volume fraction, $\\phi$, is calculated as the ratio of the DNA volume to the capsid interior volume, as per the definition provided (under our interpretation of \"excluded volume\").\n$$\\phi = \\frac{V_{DNA}}{V_{capsid}} = \\frac{9180\\pi\\,\\mathrm{nm}^3}{7776\\pi\\,\\mathrm{nm}^3}$$\nThe terms $\\pi$ and $\\mathrm{nm}^3$ cancel.\n$$\\phi = \\frac{9180}{7776} = \\frac{85}{72} \\approx 1.18055...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\phi \\approx 1.18$$\n\nThis calculated value is now assessed as requested. The typical range for volume fractions in bacteriophages is stated to be from $0.2$ to $0.6$. Our calculated value of approximately $1.18$ is substantially higher than this range, exceeding even the theoretical limit of $1.0$ for a simple volume-to-volume ratio. A volume fraction greater than $1$ is physically impossible, as it implies the genome occupies more space than is available within the capsid. This result is an artifact of the oversimplified model. The model treats DNA as an incompressible hard cylinder and uses its canonical B-form parameters. In reality, under the immense pressure inside a viral capsid (tens of atmospheres), DNA is highly bent, dehydrated, and possibly distorted from its ideal B-form structure, leading to a much denser packing arrangement than this simple model can describe.

As will be shown, it does. The problem is self-contained.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The language is precise and quantitative. It is free of subjective claims or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, internally consistent, and well-posed. A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires two sequential calculations: first, the determination of the release flux per individual VAP, and second, the prediction of the new burst onset time under inhibitor treatment.\n\n**Part 1: Inference of Per-VAP Release Flux**\n\nLet $R_{total}$ be the total virion release rate per infected cell, and let $N_{VAP}$ be the average number of active (open) VAPs per cell. The problem states that between $t=150$ min and $t=160$ min, these values are constant.\nThe givens are:\n- $R_{total} = 120$ virions min$^{-1}$ cell$^{-1}$\n- $N_{VAP} = 4$ VAPs cell$^{-1}$\n\nThe release flux per VAP, denoted $\\Phi_{VAP}$, is the total release rate divided by the number of egress structures.\n\n$$ \\Phi_{VAP} = \\frac{R_{total}}{N_{VAP}} $$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n$$ \\Phi_{VAP} = \\frac{120 \\text{ virions min}^{-1}}{4 \\text{ VAPs}} = 30 \\text{ virions min}^{-1} \\text{VAP}^{-1} $$\n\nThis is the release flux per VAP. Though not the final requested answer, its calculation is a required intermediate step.\n\n**Part 2: Prediction of New Burst Onset Time**\n\nThe burst onset time, $T_{burst}$, is defined as the moment the first VAP opens. This occurs when a VAP, which begins forming at time $t_{start}$, has grown for a sufficient duration, $\\Delta t_{growth}$, to reach the critical edge length $L^*$.\n\nThe relationship is:\n$$ T_{burst} = t_{start} + \\Delta t_{growth} $$\n\nThe growth of the VAP edge length is linear with rate $v$. Assuming the edge length at $t_{start}$ is negligible ($L(t_{start}) \\approx 0$), the time required to reach $L^*$ is:\n$$ \\Delta t_{growth} = \\frac{L^*}{v} $$\n\nTherefore, the burst onset time is given by the general formula:\n$$ T_{burst} = t_{start} + \\frac{L^*}{v} $$\n\nFirst, we analyze the untreated condition to verify the model's consistency with the data.\n- $t_{start} = 125$ min\n- $L^* = 300$ nm\n- $v = 12$ nm min$^{-1}$\n\nThe growth duration for an untreated VAP is:\n$$ \\Delta t_{untreated} = \\frac{300 \\text{ nm}}{12 \\text{ nm min}^{-1}} = 25 \\text{ min} $$\n\nThe burst onset time for the untreated case is:\n$$ T_{burst, untreated} = 125 \\text{ min} + 25 \\text{ min} = 150 \\text{ min} $$\nThis result is consistent with the problem statement that virion release (and thus, the presence of open VAPs) is observed from $t=150$ min onwards. It also confirms that virion release, starting at $t=150$ min, is indeed limited by VAP opening, as mature virions are already available by $t=140$ min.\n\nNext, we analyze the condition with the inhibitor. The inhibitor reduces the polymerization rate constant to a fraction $f=0.60$ of its original value. Since the VAP edge length growth is a direct result of this polymerization, the linear growth rate $v$ is reduced by the same factor.\n\nThe new growth rate, $v_{inhibited}$, is:\n$$ v_{inhibited} = f \\cdot v = 0.60 \\times 12 \\text{ nm min}^{-1} = 7.2 \\text{ nm min}^{-1} $$\n\nThe parameters $t_{start}$ and $L^*$ are unaffected by the inhibitor. The new growth duration, $\\Delta t_{inhibited}$, is:\n$$ \\Delta t_{inhibited} = \\frac{L^*}{v_{inhibited}} = \\frac{300 \\text{ nm}}{7.2 \\text{ nm min}^{-1}} = \\frac{3000}{72} \\text{ min} = \\frac{125}{3} \\text{ min} $$\n\nThe new burst onset time, $T_{burst, inhibited}$, is:\n$$ T_{burst, inhibited} = t_{start} + \\Delta t_{inhibited} = 125 \\text{ min} + \\frac{125}{3} \\text{ min} $$\n$$ T_{burst, inhibited} = \\left(\\frac{375}{3} + \\frac{125}{3}\\right) \\text{ min} = \\frac{500}{3} \\text{ min} $$\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$ T_{burst, inhibited} \\approx 166.666... \\text{ min} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ T_{burst, inhibited} \\approx 167 \\text{ min} $$\nThis is the predicted burst onset time under inhibitor treatment.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{167}$$", "id": "2474609"}]}
