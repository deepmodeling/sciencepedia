Rolling-circle replication is a known mechanism for ssDNA bacteriophages (e.g., family Inoviridae, Microviridae). The concept of a processive polymerase with a characteristic elongation rate is a cornerstone of molecular biology.\n- The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary parameters ($L$, $v$) and idealizations (constant velocity, no overhead) to permit the derivation of a unique, stable, and meaningful solution.\n- The problem is objective and uses precise, unambiguous language.\n- The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a standard, albeit simplified, biophysical problem that can be formalized and solved from first principles.\n\nStep 3: Verdict\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the time, let us call it $T$, to synthesize a single strand of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of length $L$ nucleotides. The synthesis is carried out by a polymerase moving at a constant velocity, $v$.\n\nThe velocity $v$ is defined as the constant rate of nucleotide incorporation. Let $n(t)$ represent the number of nucleotides that have been synthesized at time $t$. The instantaneous rate of synthesis is the time derivative of $n(t)$. According to the problem statement, this rate is constant and equal to $v$. We can therefore write the fundamental relationship as a differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dn}{dt} = v\n$$\nThe units are consistent: $n$ is in nucleotides, $t$ is in seconds, so $\\frac{dn}{dt}$ is in $\\mathrm{nucleotides} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which matches the units of $v$.\n\nThe problem specifies that initiation overhead is ignored. This implies that at the beginning of the elongation process, at time $t=0$, no nucleotides have been synthesized yet. This gives us the initial condition:\n$$\nn(0) = 0\n$$\nWe are seeking the time $T$ at which the entire strand of length $L$ has been synthesized. This gives us the final condition:\n$$\nn(T) = L\n$$\nTo find the relationship between $L$, $v$, and $T$, we must solve the differential equation subject to these boundary conditions. We can solve this equation by separation of variables:\n$$\ndn = v \\, dt\n$$\nTo find the total time $T$ required to synthesize the total length $L$, we integrate both sides of the equation over the respective intervals. The number of nucleotides $n$ goes from $0$ to $L$, while the time $t$ goes from $0$ to $T$.\n$$\n\\int_{n=0}^{n=L} dn = \\int_{t=0}^{t=T} v \\, dt\n$$\nSince $v$ is a constant, it can be taken out of the integral on the right-hand side:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} 1 \\, dn = v \\int_{0}^{T} 1 \\, dt\n$$\nEvaluating the definite integrals gives:\n$$\n[n]_{0}^{L} = v [t]_{0}^{T}\n$$\nApplying the limits of integration:\n$$\nL - 0 = v(T - 0)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the algebraic relationship:\n$$\nL = vT\n$$\nThe problem asks for the minimal time required, which is $T$. We solve the above equation for $T$:\n$$\nT = \\frac{L}{v}\n$$\nThis expression gives the time in seconds as a function of the genome length $L$ in nucleotides and the polymerase velocity $v$ in nucleotides per second.

It presents a standard model in virology and population genetics concerning mutation accumulation in asexually replicating entities. All necessary parameters and assumptions are provided to derive a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nLet $k$ be the random variable representing the number of point mutations in a single progeny genome. The genome has a length of $L$ nucleotides. The replication process is modeled as a series of $L$ independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial corresponds to the replication of a single nucleotide site. A \"success\" in this context is a mutation event, which occurs with a constant probability $\\mu$ at each site.\n\nThe exact probability distribution for $k$ is the Binomial distribution, with parameters $n=L$ (number of trials) and $p=\\mu$ (probability of success). The probability mass function is given by:\n$$P(k; L, \\mu) = \\binom{L}{k} \\mu^k (1-\\mu)^{L-k}$$\nThe problem states that we must consider the limit where $L$ is large and $\\mu$ is small. This is the characteristic \"rare-event\" limit under which the Binomial distribution converges to the Poisson distribution. The parameter of the resulting Poisson distribution, denoted by $\\lambda$, is the expected number of events (mutations). This is equal to the mean of the Binomial distribution:\n$$\\lambda = E[k] = L \\mu$$\nThus, in this limit, the number of mutations $k$ per genome is governed by a Poisson distribution. The form of this distribution is given by the probability mass function:\n$$P(k; \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\nThe first part of the problem asks for the form of this distribution and its mean. We have just derived both. The distribution is Poisson, and its mean is $\\lambda = L\\mu$.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires the evaluation of the fraction of progeny genomes with zero mutations. This corresponds to calculating the probability $P(k=0)$. Using the Poisson probability mass function:\n$$P(k=0) = \\frac{\\lambda^0 \\exp(-\\lambda)}{0!}$$\nBy definition, $\\lambda^0 = 1$ and $0! = 1$.

First, we calculate the mean number of mutations per genome, $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = L\\mu = (3600) \\times (10^{-4}) = 0.36$$\nThis mean value is indeed much smaller than the genome length $L$, which is consistent with the \"rare-event\" assumption. The fraction of error-free progeny is then:\n$$f_0 = \\exp(-0.36)$$\nCalculating this value:\n$$f_0 \\approx 0.6976763...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

Let's simplify equation (1) by substituting terms from (2) and (3):\nFrom (2), $k_T L_T(T^\\ast) R^\\ast = (c_T + d_T) T^\\ast$.\nFrom (3), $k_X L_X(X^\\ast) R^\\ast = (c_X + d_X) X^\\ast$.\nSubstituting these into (1):\n$-(c_T + d_T) T^\\ast - (c_X + d_X) X^\\ast + c_T T^\\ast + c_X X^\\ast - d_R R^\\ast + s = 0$\n$s - d_R R^\\ast - d_T T^\\ast - d_X X^\\ast = 0$\nThis equation represents the balance of influx ($s$) and total degradation of all RNA forms at steady state.\n\nFrom (2), we can solve for $T^\\ast$ as a function of $R^\\ast$.

This is the trivial absorption equilibrium.\nIf $s>0$, then $G(0) < 0$. Since $G(R^\\ast) \\to \\infty$ as $R^\\ast \\to \\infty$, there must exist a unique positive root $R^\\ast$.\nTherefore, for any given set of non-negative parameters, there is a unique non-negative fixed point. This simplifies the selection task, as there is no ambiguity. This root $R^\\ast$ can be found numerically using a standard root-finding algorithm like the Brent method.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis via the Jacobian Matrix**\n\nTo assess the local stability of the fixed point $(R^\\ast, T^\\ast, X^\\ast, P^\\ast)$, we compute the Jacobian matrix $J = \\left[ \\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial y_j} \\right]$ of the system evaluated at this point, where $y = (R, T, X, P)^T$. The fixed point is locally asymptotically stable if and only if all eigenvalues of $J$ have negative real parts, which is equivalent to $\\lambda_{\\max} = \\max_i \\Re(\\lambda_i) < 0$.\n\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$\\dfrac{\\partial L_T(T)}{\\partial T} = -\\dfrac{L_T(T)^2}{C_T}$ and $\\dfrac{\\partial L_X(X)}{\\partial X} = -\\dfrac{L_X(X)^2}{C_X}$.\n\nThe entries of the Jacobian matrix $J$ are:\n$J_{11} = \\dfrac{\\partial (dR/dt)}{\\partial R} = -k_T L_T(T) - k_X L_X(X) - d_R$\n$J_{12} = \\dfrac{\\partial (dR/dt)}{\\partial T} = -k_T R \\dfrac{\\partial L_T(T)}{\\partial T} + c_T = k_T R \\dfrac{L_T(T)^2}{C_T} + c_T$\n$J_{13} = \\dfrac{\\partial (dR/dt)}{\\partial X} = -k_X R \\dfrac{\\partial L_X(X)}{\\partial X} + c_X = k_X R \\dfrac{L_X(X)^2}{C_X} + c_X$\n$J_{14} = \\dfrac{\\partial (dR/dt)}{\\partial P} = 0$\n\n$J_{21} = \\dfrac{\\partial (dT/dt)}{\\partial R} = k_T L_T(T)$\n$J_{22} = \\dfrac{\\partial (dT/dt)}{\\partial T} = k_T R \\dfrac{\\partial L_T(T)}{\\partial T} - (c_T + d_T) = -k_T R \\dfrac{L_T(T)^2}{C_T} - (c_T + d_T)$\n$J_{23} = \\dfrac{\\partial (dT/dt)}{\\partial X} = 0$\n$J_{24} = \\dfrac{\\partial (dT/dt)}{\\partial P} = 0$\n\n$J_{31} = \\dfrac{\\partial (dX/dt)}{\\partial R} = k_X L_X(X)$\n$J_{32} = \\dfrac{\\partial (dX/dt)}{\\partial T} = 0$\n$J_{33} = \\dfrac{\\partial (dX/dt)}{\\partial X} = k_X R \\dfrac{\\partial L_X(X)}{\\partial X} - (c_X + d_X) = -k_X R \\dfrac{L_X(X)^2}{C_X} - (c_X + d_X)$\n$J_{34} = \\dfrac{\\partial (dX/dt)}{\\partial P} = 0$\n\n$J_{41} = \\dfrac{\\partial (dP/dt)}{\\partial R} = 0$\n$J_{42} = \\dfrac{\\partial (dP/dt)}{\\partial T} = 0$\n$J_{43} = \\dfrac{\\partial (dP/dt)}{\\partial X} = c_X$\n$J_{44} = \\dfrac{\\partial (dP/dt)}{\\partial P} = -d_P$\n\nThe Jacobian matrix has a block lower triangular structure:\n$$\nJ = \\begin{pmatrix}\nJ_{11} & J_{12} & J_{13} & 0 \\\\\nJ_{21} & J_{22} & 0 & 0 \\\\\nJ_{31} & 0 & J_{33} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & J_{43} & J_{44}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of $J$ are the eigenvalues of the upper-left $3 \\times 3$ block (governing the $R,T,X$ subsystem) and the eigenvalue $J_{44} = -d_P$. Since $d_P > 0$, this eigenvalue is always negative. The stability is thus determined by the eigenvalues of the $3 \\times 3$ subsystem.\n\n**3. Implementation**\n\nThe numerical implementation will:\n1.  For each test case, check if $s=0$. If so, the fixed point is $(0,0,0,0)$.\n2.  If $s>0$, use `scipy.optimize.brentq` to solve $G(R^\\ast)=0$ for $R^\\ast$ over a suitable interval (e.g., $[0, 10^6]$). Then compute $T^\\ast$, $X^\\ast$, and $P^\\ast$ using their explicit formulas.\n3.  Evaluate all entries of the Jacobian matrix at the computed fixed point $(R^\\ast, T^\\ast, X^\\ast, P^\\ast)$.\n4.  Use `numpy.linalg.eigvals` to find the eigenvalues of the resulting numerical Jacobian matrix.\n5.  Find the maximum of the real parts of these eigenvalues to determine $\\lambda_{\\max}$.\n6.
