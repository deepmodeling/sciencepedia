This exercise guides you through modeling this distribution from first principles, demonstrating how the binomial distribution of discrete infection events converges to the Poisson distribution under the 'law of rare events' typical for viral infections. By applying this model to a given multiplicity of infection ($MOI$), you will calculate the fractions of uninfected, singly infected, and multiply infected cells, a core skill for designing experiments and interpreting phenomena like genetic complementation [@problem_id:2544916].", "problem": "A clonal population of susceptible cells is exposed to a lytic virus inoculum with multiplicity of infection (MOI) $m = 0.3$. Assume adsorption events of individual virions to a given cell occur independently and are rare, with the total number of adsorption events per cell being the sum of many independent Bernoulli trials with small success probability. Work from this independence assumption and the law of rare events to obtain the distribution of the number of adsorbed virions per cell, then use that distribution to compute population fractions.\n\nStarting from first principles (i.e., independent adsorption of $N$ virions across $M$ cells with per-virion per-cell hit probability $p = 1/M$, and keeping $m = Np$ fixed as $N \\to \\infty$, $p \\to 0$), derive the probability mass function for the number of virions $K$ adsorbed by a given cell. Then, for $m = 0.3$, compute the fraction of cells that are uninfected ($K = 0$), singly infected ($K = 1$), and multiply infected ($K \\geq 2$). Finally, consider a strict genetic complementation scenario in which productive output requires at least two distinct viral genomes coinfecting the same cell; under the idealized assumption that any cell with $K \\geq 2$ coinfections achieves complementation with probability $1$, whereas cells with $K \\leq 1$ do not complement, determine the expected fraction of cells that are capable of complementation at MOI $m = 0.3$.\n\nReport only the complementation-capable fraction as your final answer, expressed as a decimal fraction and rounded to $4$ significant figures. Do not use a percent sign.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the distribution for the number of virions, $K$, adsorbed to a single cell, under the specified \"law of rare events\" limiting conditions. We are given $N$ virions and $M$ cells. For any individual virion, the probability of adsorbing to a specific, designated cell is $p = 1/M$. The adsorption of each of the $N$ virions to our target cell is an independent Bernoulli trial. Therefore, the total number of successful adsorption events, $K$, follows a binomial distribution with parameters $N$ (number of trials) and $p$ (probability of success):\n$$P(K=k) = \\binom{N}{k} p^k (1-p)^{N-k}$$\nThe problem instructs us to consider the limit where $N \\to \\infty$ and $M \\to \\infty$ such that the multiplicity of infection (MOI), $m = N/M$, remains constant. The probability $p$ is related to $m$ and $N$ by $p = 1/M = m/N$. As $N \\to \\infty$ while $m$ is fixed, it follows that $p \\to 0$. This is the classic Poisson limit of the binomial distribution. We perform this derivation formally.\n\nSubstitute $p = m/N$ into the binomial probability mass function:\n$$P(K=k) = \\frac{N!}{k!(N-k)!} \\left(\\frac{m}{N}\\right)^k \\left(1-\\frac{m}{N}\\right)^{N-k}$$\nWe rearrange the terms to analyze the limit as $N \\to \\infty$:\n$$P(K=k) = \\frac{m^k}{k!} \\frac{N(N-1)\\cdots(N-k+1)}{N^k} \\left(1-\\frac{m}{N}\\right)^N \\left(1-\\frac{m}{N}\\right)^{-k}$$\nWe evaluate the limit of each component as $N \\to \\infty$:\n1.  The term $\\frac{m^k}{k!}$ is independent of $N$.\n2.  The product $\\frac{N(N-1)\\cdots(N-k+1)}{N^k} = \\frac{N}{N} \\cdot \\frac{N-1}{N} \\cdots \\frac{N-k+1}{N} = 1 \\cdot \\left(1-\\frac{1}{N}\\right) \\cdots \\left(1-\\frac{k-1}{N}\\right)$. For any fixed integer $k$, this product approaches $1$ as $N \\to \\infty$.\n3.  By the definition of the exponential function, $\\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\left(1-\\frac{m}{N}\\right)^N = \\exp(-m)$.\n4.  For any fixed $k$, $\\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\left(1-\\frac{m}{N}\\right)^{-k} = (1-0)^{-k} = 1$.\n\nCombining these results, the limiting distribution is:\n$$\\lim_{N\\to\\infty} P(K=k) = \\frac{m^k}{k!} \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\exp(-m) \\cdot 1 = \\frac{\\exp(-m) m^k}{k!}$$\nThis is the probability mass function of the Poisson distribution with parameter $m$. The fraction of cells in a large population that are infected by exactly $k$ virions is well-approximated by this probability.\n\nThe problem asks for the fraction of cells that can support genetic complementation. According to the stated conditions, complementation occurs if and only if a cell is infected by at least two virions, i.e., $K \\ge 2$. The fraction of such cells, denoted $F_{comp}$, is therefore $P(K \\ge 2)$. It is more direct to calculate this by finding the sum of the probabilities of the complementary events, $K=0$ and $K=1$, and subtracting from $1$.\n$$F_{comp} = P(K \\ge 2) = 1 - P(K < 2) = 1 - \\big( P(K=0) + P(K=1) \\big)$$\nUsing the derived Poisson PMF:\n$$P(K=0) = \\frac{\\exp(-m) m^0}{0!} = \\exp(-m)$$\n$$P(K=1) = \\frac{\\exp(-m) m^1}{1!} = m \\exp(-m)$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $F_{comp}$:\n$$F_{comp} = 1 - (\\exp(-m) + m \\exp(-m)) = 1 - (1+m)\\exp(-m)$$\nWe are given an MOI of $m = 0.3$. We substitute this value into our derived formula:\n$$F_{comp} = 1 - (1+0.3)\\exp(-0.3) = 1 - 1.3\\exp(-0.3)$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value.\n$$ \\exp(-0.3) \\approx 0.74081822 $$\n$$ F_{comp} \\approx 1 - 1.3 \\times 0.74081822 = 1 - 0.963063686 = 0.036936314 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. The first four significant figures are $3$, $6$, $9$, $3$. The fifth significant figure is $6$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$ F_{comp} \\approx 0.03694 $$\nThis is the expected fraction of cells in the population that are capable of complementation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.03694}$$", "id": "2544916"}, {"introduction": "The viral replication cycle is a series of choreographed events, and identifying the slowest, or rate-limiting, step is key to understanding its overall kinetics.
