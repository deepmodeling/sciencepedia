It does not violate any of a professor's criteria for a valid problem. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Triangulation Number, $T$**\n\nLet the two basis vectors of the equilateral triangular lattice be $\\mathbf{a}_1$ and $\\mathbf{a}_2$. As given, they have equal length, which we denote as $a$, so $|\\mathbf{a}_1| = |\\mathbf{a}_2| = a$. The angle $\\theta$ between them is $60^{\\circ}$, or $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ radians. The dot product is therefore $\\mathbf{a}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_2 = |\\mathbf{a}_1||\\mathbf{a}_2|\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{3}) = a^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe vector $\\mathbf{V}$ connecting two adjacent five-fold vertices in the unrolled lattice is given by the linear combination $\\mathbf{V} = h\\mathbf{a}_1 + k\\mathbf{a}_2$, where $h$ and $k$ are integers. The triangulation number $T$ is defined as the square of the ratio of the distance between adjacent five-fold vertices to the length of the unit lattice vector. This is geometrically equivalent to the number of unit triangles that fit into one of the $20$ large triangular faces of the icosahedron defined by the vector $\\mathbf{V}$.\n$$T = \\frac{|\\mathbf{V}|^2}{a^2}$$\nWe compute the squared magnitude of $\\mathbf{V}$:\n$$|\\mathbf{V}|^2 = \\mathbf{V} \\cdot \\mathbf{V} = (h\\mathbf{a}_1 + k\\mathbf{a}_2) \\cdot (h\\mathbf{a}_1 + k\\mathbf{a}_2)$$\n$$|\\mathbf{V}|^2 = h^2(\\mathbf{a}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_1) + k^2(\\mathbf{a}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_2) + 2hk(\\mathbf{a}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_2)$$\nSubstituting the known dot products: $\\mathbf{a}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_1 = a^2$, $\\mathbf{a}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_2 = a^2$, and $\\mathbf{a}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_2 = \\frac{1}{2}a^2$.\n$$|\\mathbf{V}|^2 = h^2 a^2 + k^2 a^2 + 2hk \\left(\\frac{1}{2} a^2\\right) = a^2(h^2 + k^2 + hk)$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $T$:\n$$T = \\frac{a^2(h^2 + k^2 + hk)}{a^2} = h^2 + hk + k^2$$\nFor the given values $h=3$ and $k=1$:\n$$T = 3^2 + (3)(1) + 1^2 = 9 + 3 + 1 = 13$$\n\n**Part 2: Number of Pentameric and Hexameric Capsomers**\n\nWe use the Euler characteristic for a convex polyhedron, $V - E + F = 2$, where $V$, $E$, and $F$ are the numbers of vertices, edges, and faces of the capsomer shell, respectively. Let $N_p$ be the number of pentameric capsomers and $N_h$ be the number of hexameric capsomers.\n\nThe total number of faces (capsomers) is $F = N_p + N_h$.\nEach pentamer has $5$ edges and each hexamer has $6$. Since each edge is shared between two capsomers, the total number of edges is $E = \\frac{5N_p + 6N_h}{2}$.\nThe problem states that three capsomers meet at each vertex. Therefore, the total number of vertices is $V = \\frac{5N_p + 6N_h}{3}$.\n\nSubstitute these expressions into Euler's formula:\n$$\\left(\\frac{5N_p + 6N_h}{3}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{5N_p + 6N_h}{2}\\right) + (N_p + N_h) = 2$$\nTo eliminate denominators, we multiply the entire equation by $6$:\n$$2(5N_p + 6N_h) - 3(5N_p + 6N_h) + 6(N_p + N_h) = 12$$\n$$10N_p + 12N_h - 15N_p - 18N_h + 6N_p + 6N_h = 12$$\nCombine like terms for $N_p$ and $N_h$:\n$$(10 - 15 + 6)N_p + (12 - 18 + 6)N_h = 12$$\n$$1 \\cdot N_p + 0 \\cdot N_h = 12$$\nThis rigorously proves that $N_p = 12$. The number of pentamers must be exactly $12$ to close any shell composed of pentons and hexons, corresponding to the $12$ vertices of an icosahedron.\n\nThe total number of capsomers in a $T$-number capsid is given by $F = 10T + 2$. Since $F = N_p + N_h$, we have:\n$$10T + 2 = 12 + N_h$$\n$$N_h = 10T + 2 - 12 = 10T - 10 = 10(T-1)$$\nThe number of hexameric capsomers is $10(T-1)$.\n\n**Part 3: Total Number of Protein Subunits, $N$**\n\nThe total number of protein subunits, $N$, is the sum of subunits from all pentamers and hexamers. Each pentamer has $5$ subunits and each hexamer has $6$.\n$$N = 5 \\cdot N_p + 6 \\cdot N_h$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $N_p$ and $N_h$:\n$$N = 5(12) + 6(10(T-1)) = 60 + 60T - 60 = 60T$$\nThis result can also be deduced from the symmetry argument. The icosahedral group has $60$ rotational symmetries. The capsid surface is covered by $60$ identical asymmetric units. For a given triangulation number $T$, each asymmetric unit contains $T$ protein monomers arranged in a \"quasi-equivalent\" manner. Thus, the total number of monomers is $N=60T$.\n\nFor $T=13$, the total number of protein subunits is:\n$$N = 60 \\times 13 = 780$$\n\n**Part 4: Distribution of Pentamers and Hexamers**\n\nThe $12$ pentamers are rigidly positioned at the $12$ five-fold symmetry axes of the underlying icosahedron, inducing the necessary curvature for shell closure. The $N_h = 10(T-1)$ hexamers form the planar, hexagonally packed arrays on the faces and edges of the icosahedron, filling the space between the pentamers.\n\n**Final Calculation Summary**\n- Triangulation number: $T = 13$.\n- Total protein subunits: $N = 780$.\nThe final answer is to be reported as the row matrix $(T \\ \\ N)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n13 & 780\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2544222"}, {"introduction": "A static blueprint is only half the story; the dynamic process of self-assembly determines whether a functional virion can form efficiently.

In the reversible limit, the force exerted by the motor is equal in magnitude to this opposing force.\n\nWe substitute the expression for $F(l)$ into the integral for work:\n$$W = \\int_{0}^{L_f} F_{0}\\left(1 - \\frac{l}{L_{\\mathrm{max}}}\\right)^{-1} dl$$\nHere, the final packaged length is given as $L_f = 12\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we perform a change of variables. Let the dimensionless variable $u$ be defined as:\n$$u = 1 - \\frac{l}{L_{\\mathrm{max}}}$$\nThe differential $du$ is then related to $dl$ as:\n$$du = -\\frac{1}{L_{\\mathrm{max}}} dl \\implies dl = -L_{\\mathrm{max}} du$$\nWe must also transform the limits of integration from the variable $l$ to the variable $u$:\n- When $l = 0$, the lower limit becomes $u = 1 - \\frac{0}{L_{\\mathrm{max}}} = 1$.\n- When $l = L_f$, the upper limit becomes $u = 1 - \\frac{L_f}{L_{\\mathrm{max}}}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the integral gives:\n$$W = \\int_{1}^{1 - L_f/L_{\\mathrm{max}}} F_{0} (u)^{-1} (-L_{\\mathrm{max}} du)$$\n$$W = -F_{0}L_{\\mathrm{max}} \\int_{1}^{1 - L_f/L_{\\mathrm{max}}} \\frac{1}{u} du$$\nThis is the integral of $1/u$, which is the natural logarithm of the absolute value of $u$.\n$$W = -F_{0}L_{\\mathrm{max}} \\left[ \\ln|u| \\right]_{1}^{1 - L_f/L_{\\mathrm{max}}}$$\nSince $L_f < L_{\\mathrm{max}}$, the term $1 - L_f/L_{\\mathrm{max}}$ is positive, so the absolute value signs are not strictly necessary. Evaluating the definite integral:\n$$W = -F_{0}L_{\\mathrm{max}} \\left[ \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{L_f}{L_{\\mathrm{max}}}\\right) - \\ln(1) \\right]$$\nSince $\\ln(1) = 0$, the expression for the work simplifies to:\n$$W = -F_{0}L_{\\mathrm{max}} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{L_f}{L_{\\mathrm{max}}}\\right)$$\nNow we substitute the given physical quantities in SI units.\n$F_{0} = 5\\,\\mathrm{pN} = 5 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{N}$\n$L_{\\mathrm{max}} = 16\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 16 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$L_f = 12\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 12 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nThe dimensionless ratio of lengths is:\n$$\\frac{L_f}{L_{\\mathrm{max}}} = \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{16 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{12}{16} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$$\nThe pre-factor $F_{0}L_{\\mathrm{max}}$ is:\n$$F_{0}L_{\\mathrm{max}} = (5 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{N}) \\times (16 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 80 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{N \\cdot m} = 80 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\nSubstituting these values back into the expression for work:\n$$W = -(80 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{J}) \\times \\ln(1 - 0.75)$$\n$$W = -(80 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{J}) \\times \\ln(0.25)$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(x^y) = y \\ln(x)$, we can write $\\ln(0.25) = \\ln(1/4) = \\ln(4^{-1}) = -\\ln(4) = -2\\ln(2)$.\n$$W = -(80 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{J}) \\times (-2 \\ln(2)) = 160 \\ln(2) \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\nUsing the numerical value $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.69314718$:\n$$W \\approx 160 \\times 0.69314718 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\n$$W \\approx 110.90355 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\nExpressing this in standard scientific notation:\n$$W \\approx 1.1090355 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$W \\approx 1.109 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{J}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.109 \\times 10^{-16}}$$", "id": "2544203"}]}
