No numerical evaluation is required.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard problem in chemical kinetics applied to a simplified but plausible model of DNA replication initiation. We will now proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe system is described by three states for a single replication origin site: empty ($E$), bound by ATP-Orc1/Cdc6 ($A$), and bound by ADP-Orc1/Cdc6 ($D$). The total probability is conserved, such that $E + A + D = 1$. The dynamics of the system are governed by mass-action kinetics, based on the following reaction scheme:\n$$ E \\underset{k_{off}}{\\stackrel{k_{on}[ATP]}{\\rightleftarrows}} A \\xrightarrow{k_{hyd}} D \\xrightarrow{k_{off}} E $$\nHere, $k_{on}[ATP]$ represents the pseudo-first-order rate for the transition from $E$ to $A$. The rate constant for dissociation from either bound state ($A$ or $D$) to the empty state is $k_{off}$. The rate constant for ATP hydrolysis, which converts state $A$ to state $D$, is $k_{hyd}$. It is assumed that the ATP concentration, $[ATP]$, is held constant and that there is no nucleotide exchange on the bound complex (i.e., no transition from $D$ to $A$).\n\nWe construct the system of ordinary differential equations that describes the time evolution of the fraction of sites in each state:\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = k_{on}[ATP] \\cdot E - (k_{off} + k_{hyd}) \\cdot A $$\n$$ \\frac{dD}{dt} = k_{hyd} \\cdot A - k_{off} \\cdot D $$\n$$ \\frac{dE}{dt} = k_{off} \\cdot A + k_{off} \\cdot D - k_{on}[ATP] \\cdot E $$\nTo find the steady-state fractions, we set the time derivatives to zero:\n$1.$ $k_{on}[ATP] \\cdot E - (k_{off} + k_{hyd}) \\cdot A = 0$\n$2.$ $k_{hyd} \\cdot A - k_{off} \\cdot D = 0$\n\nFrom equation $(2)$, we can express the steady-state fraction $D$ in terms of $A$:\n$$ k_{hyd} \\cdot A = k_{off} \\cdot D $$\n$$ D = \\frac{k_{hyd}}{k_{off}} A $$\nThis relationship shows that at steady state, the ratio of the ADP-bound fraction to the ATP-bound fraction is determined solely by the ratio of the hydrolysis rate to the dissociation rate.\n\nThe quantity of interest is the fraction of origin-bound Orc1/Cdc6 that is in the ATP-bound state, defined as $f_{ATP} = \\frac{A}{A + D}$. We can compute this ratio directly using the expression for $D$ derived above. We substitute the expression for $D$ into the denominator of $f_{ATP}$:\n$$ f_{ATP} = \\frac{A}{A + \\left(\\frac{k_{hyd}}{k_{off}}\\right) A} $$\nAssuming a non-trivial steady state where the origin is sometimes bound ($A \\neq 0$), we can factor $A$ from the denominator and simplify:\n$$ f_{ATP} = \\frac{A}{A\\left(1 + \\frac{k_{hyd}}{k_{off}}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{k_{hyd}}{k_{off}}} $$\nTo present this as a single fraction, we find a common denominator:\n$$ f_{ATP} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{k_{off} + k_{hyd}}{k_{off}}} = \\frac{k_{off}}{k_{off} + k_{hyd}} $$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for $f_{ATP}$. It is notable that this ratio is entirely independent of the association rate constant $k_{on}$ and the concentration of ATP, $[ATP]$. This is because $f_{ATP}$ describes the partitioning between the two bound states, $A$ and $D$, which is governed by the kinetic competition between hydrolysis ($A \\to D$) and dissociation ($A \\to E$).\n\nBased on this expression, we can infer the impact of the relative rates of hydrolysis and dissociation on origin licensing. Licensing is mediated by the ATP-bound state $A$. The derived fraction $f_{ATP}$ represents the probability that a bound Orc1/Cdc6 complex is in this active, licensing-competent state.\nThe expression can be rewritten as $f_{ATP} = \\left(1 + \\frac{k_{hyd}}{k_{off}}\\right)^{-1}$.\n- If hydrolysis is slow compared to dissociation ($k_{hyd} \\ll k_{off}$), the ratio $\\frac{k_{hyd}}{k_{off}}$ is small, and $f_{ATP}$ approaches $1$. This means the complex is very likely to dissociate before it hydrolyzes ATP. Thus, when bound, the initiator is almost entirely in the active state $A$, maximizing the opportunity for licensing during its binding lifetime.\n- If hydrolysis is fast compared to dissociation ($k_{hyd} \\gg k_{off}$), the ratio $\\frac{k_{hyd}}{k_{off}}$ is large, and $f_{ATP}$ approaches $0$. In this scenario, ATP hydrolysis occurs rapidly upon binding, quickly converting the complex to the inactive state $D$. This provides a very short time window for licensing to occur, making the process inefficient.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of $k_{hyd}$ to $k_{off}$ acts as a crucial control parameter. For effective origin licensing, the rate of ATP hydrolysis must be tuned relative to the initiator's residence time on the DNA (which is inversely proportional to $k_{off}$). A high hydrolysis rate acts as a stringent \"timer\" that terminates the active state, which is a common regulatory motif in biological molecular machines.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{k_{off}}{k_{off} + k_{hyd}}}$$", "id": "2486851"}, {"introduction": "Once replication is initiated, the processivity of the DNA polymerase becomes paramount for efficient synthesis.

It is a standard exercise in stochastic process modeling applied to molecular biology. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem states that dissociation is a memoryless event with a constant hazard rate $k_{\\text{off}}$. This is the defining characteristic of a Poisson process, which implies that the time until the event occurs (the dwell time $T$) follows an exponential probability distribution. The probability density function (PDF) for the random variable $T$ is given by:\n$$p(t) = k_{\\text{off}} \\exp(-k_{\\text{off}} t) \\quad \\text{for } t \\ge 0$$\nThe average, or expected, dwell time $\\mathbb{E}[T]$ is the first moment of this distribution, which is calculated by the integral:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[T] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t \\cdot p(t) \\,dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t \\cdot k_{\\text{off}} \\exp(-k_{\\text{off}} t) \\,dt$$\nTo solve this integral, we use integration by parts, $\\int u \\,dv = uv - \\int v \\,du$.

Since the elongation rate $v$ is a constant, we can find the average tract length $\\mathbb{E}[L]$ by applying the linearity property of the expectation operator:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[L] = \\mathbb{E}[vT] = v \\mathbb{E}[T]$$\nSubstituting our result for $\\mathbb{E}[T]$, we arrive at the desired expression for the average tract length:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[L] = \\frac{v}{k_{\\text{off}}}$$\nThis quantity is also known as the processivity of the polymerase.\n\nNow, we compute the average tract lengths for the two given conditions.\nWithout PCNA (denoted by subscript $-$):\n$$\\mathbb{E}[L]_{-} = \\frac{v_{-}}{k_{\\text{off},-}} = \\frac{18\\ \\text{nt}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}}{0.12\\ \\text{s}^{-1}} = 150\\ \\text{nt}$$\nWith PCNA (denoted by subscript $+$):\n$$\\mathbb{E}[L]_{+} = \\frac{v_{+}}{k_{\\text{off},+}} = \\frac{28\\ \\text{nt}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}}{3.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{28}{0.0035}\\ \\text{nt} = 8000\\ \\text{nt}$$\nThe increase in average tract length, $\\Delta \\bar{L}$, is the difference between these two values:\n$$\\Delta \\bar{L} = \\mathbb{E}[L]_{+} - \\mathbb{E}[L]_{-} = 8000\\ \\text{nt} - 150\\ \\text{nt} = 7850\\ \\text{nt}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The number $7850$ is written in scientific notation as $7.85 \\times 10^{3}$.\n\nFinally, a qualitative discussion of the implications is required.\nDNA replication must synthesize two strands. The leading strand is synthesized continuously and requires a highly processive polymerase to replicate long stretches of DNA without dissociation. The lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously as a series of short Okazaki fragments. In archaea, these fragments are typically $100$â€“$200$ nucleotides long.\n\nOur calculation shows that PolD without its processivity clamp (PCNA) synthesizes an average tract of $\\mathbb{E}[L]_{-} = 150$ nucleotides. This length is precisely within the range of archaeal Okazaki fragment lengths. This implies that the intrinsic processivity of PolD is well-suited for the discontinuous synthesis of the lagging strand. The polymerase would synthesize a fragment of appropriate length and then dissociate, ready to begin synthesis of the next fragment.\n\nWith the addition of PCNA, the average tract length increases to $\\mathbb{E}[L]_{+} = 8000$ nucleotides. This represents a more than $50$-fold increase in processivity ($\\frac{8000}{150} \\approx 53.3$). This dramatic increase transforms PolD into a highly processive enzyme, capable of synthesizing thousands of nucleotides in a single binding event. Such high processivity is essential for the rapid and continuous synthesis of the leading strand. The total increase, $\\Delta \\bar{L} = 7850$ nucleotides, quantifies this functional switch.\n\nThe mechanism of this enhancement involves changes to both kinetic parameters. PCNA drastically reduces the off-rate $k_{\\text{off}}$ by a factor of approximately $\\frac{0.12}{0.0035} \\approx 34$, which tethers the polymerase to the DNA template and accounts for the majority of the processivity gain. It also moderately increases the catalytic rate $v$ by a factor of $\\frac{28}{18} \\approx 1.56$, further contributing to the longer tract length synthesized per binding event. Therefore, the clamp-mediated modulation of polymerase kinetics allows the same enzyme, PolD, to be adapted for the distinct processivity demands of leading-strand and lagging-strand synthesis in vivo.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.85 \\times 10^{3}}$$", "id": "2486791"}, {"introduction": "Efficiently replicating a large circular chromosome requires coordinating the firing of multiple origins spread across the genome.

We must analyze the conditions for passivation in both directions.\n\nCase 1: Passivation of the right origin (R) by the left origin (L).\nOrigin L fires at time $t_L$ from position $x=0$. The replication fork moving to the right propagates with velocity $v$. The position of this fork at a time $t \\ge t_L$ is given by $x_L(t) = v(t - t_L)$.\nThis fork reaches the location of origin R, at $x=D$, at an arrival time $t_{arrival, L}$.
