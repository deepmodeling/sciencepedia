The design must specify only the essential sequence modules: a cluster of DnaA recognition sites (DnaA boxes) and an adjacent DNA Unwinding Element (DUE). Your goal is to choose a design that is sufficient yet minimal, grounded in first principles of cooperative protein binding and DNA mechanics.\n\nUse the following foundational facts to reason your design:\n- DnaA is an ATPase of the AAA+ family that binds sequence-specific DnaA boxes with a defined polarity and forms head-to-tail oligomers on DNA via protein-protein interfaces that depend on the relative orientation and phasing of bound protomers.\n- Cooperative binding requires that adjacent protomers simultaneously stabilize each other through at least two protein-protein interfaces to resist thermal dissociation and to generate sufficient mechanical work to initiate duplex opening.\n- B-form DNA has a helical pitch of approximately $10.5$ base pairs (bp) per turn, so sites separated by approximately integer multiples of $10.5$ bp are aligned on the same helical face.

DnaA is an ATPase of the AAA+ family that binds sequence-specific DnaA boxes with a defined polarity and forms head-to-tail oligomers on DNA via protein-protein interfaces that depend on the relative orientation and phasing of bound protomers.\n2.  Cooperative binding requires that adjacent protomers simultaneously stabilize each other through at least two protein-protein interfaces to resist thermal dissociation and to generate sufficient mechanical work to initiate duplex opening.\n3.  B-form DNA has a helical pitch of approximately $10.5$ base pairs (bp) per turn, so sites separated by approximately integer multiples of $10.5$ bp are aligned on the same helical face. The DnaA box footprint is approximately $9$ bp.\n4.  The DNA Unwinding Element (DUE) must be sufficiently Adenine/Thymine-rich to lower the energetic cost of local strand separation and sufficiently long to support a stable, initiation-competent single-stranded bubble in the presence of physiological negative supercoiling and bound initiator.\n\nThe goal is to identify the minimal specification for a functional oriC-like module based only on these principles.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem is evaluated for validity:\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The provided facts about DnaA, cooperative binding, DNA structure, and the function of a DUE are all well-established principles in molecular biology and biophysics, particularly concerning the mechanism of replication initiation in *Escherichia coli*. The problem is firmly based on established science.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem asks for the deduction of a minimal design based on a specified set of constraints. The constraints are clear and allow for a logical derivation of a unique set of architectural features. A meaningful solution can be found.\n-   **Objective**: The language is precise and technical. It presents facts and asks for a logical conclusion, free from subjective or ambiguous phrasing.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It provides a self-contained set of principles from which a solution can be logically derived. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. I will proceed with the derivation and analysis.\n\n### Derivation of Minimal Requirements\n\nThe task is to deduce the minimal requirements for the number of DnaA boxes, their orientation, their spacing, and the DUE length, based strictly on the provided principles.\n\n1.  **Minimal Number of DnaA Boxes**:\n    The second principle states that cooperative binding requires \"at least two protein-protein interfaces\". Let us denote a DnaA protomer as $P$.\n    -   If two protomers, $P_1$ and $P_2$, are bound to two DnaA boxes, they can form at most one interface between them: $P_1-P_2$.\n    -   To form two interfaces, a minimum of three protomers, $P_1, P_2, P_3$, are necessary, allowing for two adjacent interfaces: $P_1-P_2$ and $P_2-P_3$.\n    -   Therefore, the absolute minimum number of DnaA boxes required to bind three protomers and satisfy this condition is $3$.\n\n2.  **Orientation of DnaA Boxes**:\n    The first principle states that DnaA forms \"head-to-tail oligomers\". This explicitly defines the mode of protein-protein interaction. For a continuous oligomer to form, each protomer must be oriented in the same direction relative to the DNA backbone. This means the DnaA recognition sites (DnaA boxes) must all have the same orientation (e.g., all \"head-to-tail\" relative to one another along the strand). Any arrangement involving inverted boxes (head-to-head) would disrupt this specific oligomerization.\n\n3.  **Spacing Between DnaA Boxes**:\n    The first and third principles address spacing. For protomers to interact via protein-protein interfaces, they must be positioned correctly with respect to each other.\n    -   Principle 3 states that sites on the same helical face are separated by integer multiples of $\\approx 10.5$ bp. To form a compact oligomer, adjacent protomers must be on the same helical face.\n    -   A center-to-center spacing of approximately one helical turn ($\\approx 10.5$ bp) is the most direct and sterically favorable arrangement for adjacent protomers to interact.\n    -   The DnaA box footprint is stated to be $\\approx 9$ bp. A center-to-center spacing smaller than this, such as $5$ bp, is physically impossible as it would require the DnaA boxes to overlap.\n    -   A spacing of two helical turns ($\\approx 21$ bp) places the protomers on the same face but at a considerable distance. This would likely inhibit the formation of the strong, direct protein-protein contacts characteristic of a stable oligomer, or it would require significant and energetically costly DNA looping between the boxes, making it a non-minimal or less favorable configuration compared to a single-turn spacing.\n    -   Thus, the optimal and minimal spacing is approximately one helical turn, $\\approx 10.5$ bp.\n\n4.  **Minimal DUE Length**:\n    The fourth principle requires the DUE to be long enough to form a \"stable, initiation-competent single-stranded bubble\". While no explicit number is given in the principles, we can use biophysical reasoning. A short stretch of unwound DNA (e.g., $\\approx 10-20$ bp) is thermally unstable and has a high propensity to re-anneal. For a bubble to be stable enough to allow the binding of subsequent replication factors (like DnaB helicase), it must exceed a certain critical length. The canonical *E. coli* oriC contains a DUE consisting of three $13$-mer repeats, for a total length of $39$ bp. This serves as a well-established, biologically functional benchmark for a minimal, stable DUE. A length of $20$ bp is likely insufficient, whereas a length of $39$ bp is a plausible and empirically supported minimum.\n\n**Summary of Derived Minimal Design**:\nA minimal, functional origin should consist of at least $3$ DnaA boxes in a head-to-tail orientation, separated by a center-to-center distance of approximately $10.5$ bp (one helical turn), and adjacent to an AT-rich DUE of at least $\\approx 39$ bp in length.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nEach option is now evaluated against these derived requirements.\n\n**A. $2$ DnaA boxes in head-to-head orientation, separated center-to-center by $10.5$ bp, followed by an AT-rich DUE of $20$ bp.**\n-   **Number of boxes**: $2$ boxes can only form one protein-protein interface, which contradicts the requirement for \"at least two\".\n-   **Orientation**: \"Head-to-head\" orientation is inconsistent with the formation of \"head-to-tail oligomers\".\n-   **DUE length**: $20$ bp is likely too short for a stable bubble.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This option violates multiple fundamental principles.\n\n**B. $3$ DnaA boxes in head-to-tail orientation, separated center-to-center by approximately one helical turn (implemented as alternating $10$ bp and $11$ bp such that each adjacent pair is $\\approx 11$ bp), followed by an AT-rich DUE of at least $39$ bp.**\n-   **Number of boxes**: $3$ is the correct minimum number to achieve two protein-protein interfaces.\n-   **Orientation**: \"Head-to-tail\" is the correct orientation for oligomerization.\n-   **Spacing**: \"approximately one helical turn\" is the correct principle. The implementation as integer spacings of $10$ bp and $11$ bp is a practical way to approximate the non-integer $10.5$ bp pitch, maintaining the helical phasing.\n-   **DUE length**: \"at least $39$ bp\" is a biophysically plausible and empirically supported minimal length.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**. This option is fully consistent with all principles derived for a minimal functional design, despite slightly confusing phrasing about spacing implementation.\n\n**C. $4$ DnaA boxes in head-to-tail orientation with $5$ bp center-to-center spacing to maximize local density, followed by an AT-rich DUE of $60$ bp.**\n-   **Spacing**: A center-to-center spacing of $5$ bp is physically impossible, as the footprint of each DnaA box is $\\approx 9$ bp. The binding sites would severely overlap.\n-   **Minimality**: $4$ boxes and a $60$ bp DUE are not minimal if $3$ boxes and a $39$ bp DUE are sufficient.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The proposed spacing is impossible.\n\n**D. $3$ DnaA boxes with alternating head-to-tail and head-to-head orientations (i.e., neighbors inverted), separated center-to-center by $10.5$ bp, followed by an AT-rich DUE of $39$ bp.**\n-   **Orientation**: The \"alternating\" head-to-tail and head-to-head orientation is in direct contradiction with the requirement for forming \"head-to-tail oligomers\". An inverted protomer would break the continuity of the filament.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This design is mechanistically flawed due to incorrect protein orientation.\n\n**E. $3$ DnaA boxes in head-to-tail orientation, separated center-to-center by $21$ bp, followed by an AT-rich DUE of $39$ bp.**\n-   **Spacing**: A spacing of $21$ bp is approximately two full helical turns ($2 \\times 10.5$ bp). While this aligns the protomers on the same helical face, the large separation would hinder the formation of a compact, stable oligomer based on direct protein-protein contacts between adjacent units. It is not the most parsimonious or energetically favorable design for generating mechanical stress. The minimal design would favor the closest possible interaction, which is a spacing of one helical turn.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The spacing is too large for an efficient minimal design based on adjacent protomer interactions.\n\nBased on this rigorous analysis, Option B is the only one that correctly integrates all the provided biophysical and molecular principles into a coherent, minimal, and functional design.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2528447"}, {"introduction": "Having established the structural requirements for an origin, we now turn to its regulation.

The problem is well-posed: sufficient information is provided to establish a system of equations that can be solved for the unknown, the free DnaA concentration. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be constructed.\n\nThe foundation of this problem is the law of mass action applied to the binding of a ligand (ATP–DnaA, denoted $D$) to multiple classes of binding sites. For any given class of sites $i$ (where $i$ can be $o$ for *oriC*, $d$ for *datA*, or $ns$ for nonspecific), the dissociation constant $K_i$ is defined as $K_i = \\frac{[D_f][S_i]}{[D_b S_i]}$, where concentrations are expressed as molecules per cell. Let $D_f$ be the number of free ATP–DnaA molecules. The number of sites of type $i$ bound by DnaA, which we denote $D_{b,i}$, is given by the Langmuir isotherm:\n$$D_{b,i} = \\frac{M_i D_f}{K_i + D_f}$$\nwhere $M_i$ is the total number of sites of type $i$.\n\nThe total number of ATP–DnaA molecules, $D_T$, is conserved. It is the sum of free molecules ($D_f$) and molecules bound to all classes of sites:\n$$D_T = D_f + D_{b,o} + D_{b,d} + D_{b,ns}$$\nSubstituting the isotherm expressions for each class of site gives the full equilibrium equation:\n$$D_T = D_f + \\frac{M_o D_f}{K_o + D_f} + \\frac{M_d D_f}{K_d + D_f} + \\frac{M_{ns} D_f}{K_{ns} + D_f}$$\nThis equation is a high-degree polynomial in $D_f$ and cannot be solved analytically in its exact form. As instructed, we must state and justify approximations to find a closed-form solution.\n\nWe analyze the given parameters to make these justifications:\n- *oriC* sites: $K_o = 5$. Since *oriC* must be bound for replication to initiate, the steady-state concentration of free DnaA, $D_f$, must be at least comparable to or greater than $K_o$. We will hypothesize that $D_f \\gg K_o$.\n- *datA* sites: $K_d = 10^3$. The total number of DnaA molecules is $D_T = 600$, so it is certain that $D_f < D_T < K_d$. Thus, we can make the approximation $K_d + D_f \\approx K_d$.\n- Nonspecific sites: $K_{ns} = 10^6$. Similarly, $D_f \\ll K_{ns}$, so we can approximate $K_{ns} + D_f \\approx K_{ns}$.\n\nApplying these approximations simplifies the binding terms:\n- For *oriC* ($D_f \\gg K_o$): The occupation fraction $\\frac{D_f}{K_o + D_f}$ approaches $1$. Therefore, the number of bound molecules $D_{b,o} = \\frac{M_o D_f}{K_o + D_f}$ approaches the saturation value, $M_o$.\n- For *datA* ($D_f \\ll K_d$): The binding is in the linear regime, $D_{b,d} \\approx \\frac{M_d D_f}{K_d}$.\n- For nonspecific sites ($D_f \\ll K_{ns}$): Binding is also in the linear regime, $D_{b,ns} \\approx \\frac{M_{ns} D_f}{K_{ns}}$.\n\nThe conservation equation becomes a linear equation in $D_f$:\n$$D_T \\approx D_f + M_o + \\frac{M_d D_f}{K_d} + \\frac{M_{ns} D_f}{K_{ns}}$$\nWe can now solve for $D_f$:\n$$D_T - M_o \\approx D_f \\left(1 + \\frac{M_d}{K_d} + \\frac{M_{ns}}{K_{ns}}\\right)$$\nThis yields the general expression for $D_f$ as a function of the number of *datA* sites, $M_d$:\n$$D_f(M_d) \\approx \\frac{D_T - M_o}{1 + \\frac{M_{ns}}{K_{ns}} + \\frac{M_d}{K_d}}$$\nBefore proceeding, we must check if our initial assumption, $D_f \\gg K_o$, is self-consistent. Let us calculate $D_f$ for the `pre`-duplication state ($M_d=18$):\n$$D_{f, \\text{pre}} \\approx \\frac{600 - 9}{1 + \\frac{10^4}{10^6} + \\frac{18}{10^3}} = \\frac{591}{1 + 0.01 + 0.018} = \\frac{591}{1.028} \\approx 574.9$$\nSince $574.9 \\gg 5$ (i.e., $D_f \\gg K_o$), our approximation that the *oriC* sites are saturated is valid and self-consistent.\n\nNow we can calculate the free DnaA concentrations before and after *datA* duplication.\nBefore duplication (`pre` state), $M_d = 18$:\n$$D_{f,\\text{pre}} = \\frac{D_T - M_o}{1 + \\frac{M_{ns}}{K_{ns}} + \\frac{M_d}{K_d}}$$\nAfter duplication (`post` state), the number of *datA* sites doubles to $2M_d$:\n$$D_{f,\\text{post}} = \\frac{D_T - M_o}{1 + \\frac{M_{ns}}{K_{ns}} + \\frac{2 M_d}{K_d}}$$\nWe are asked to find the fractional drop $\\delta$:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{D_{f,\\text{pre}} - D_{f,\\text{post}}}{D_{f,\\text{pre}}} = 1 - \\frac{D_{f,\\text{post}}}{D_{f,\\text{pre}}}$$\nSubstituting our expressions for $D_{f,\\text{pre}}$ and $D_{f,\\text{post}}$:\n$$\\delta = 1 - \\frac{\\frac{D_T - M_o}{1 + \\frac{M_{ns}}{K_{ns}} + \\frac{2 M_d}{K_d}}}{\\frac{D_T - M_o}{1 + \\frac{M_{ns}}{K_{ns}} + \\frac{M_d}{K_d}}} = 1 - \\frac{1 + \\frac{M_{ns}}{K_{ns}} + \\frac{M_d}{K_d}}{1 + \\frac{M_{ns}}{K_{ns}} + \\frac{2 M_d}{K_d}}$$\nLet's simplify this expression:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{\\left(1 + \\frac{M_{ns}}{K_{ns}} + \\frac{2 M_d}{K_d}\\right) - \\left(1 + \\frac{M_{ns}}{K_{ns}} + \\frac{M_d}{K_d}\\right)}{1 + \\frac{M_{ns}}{K_{ns}} + \\frac{2 M_d}{K_d}} = \\frac{\\frac{M_d}{K_d}}{1 + \\frac{M_{ns}}{K_{ns}} + \\frac{2 M_d}{K_d}}$$\nNow we substitute the numerical values into this final symbolic expression:\n- $\\frac{M_d}{K_d} = \\frac{18}{10^3} = 0.018$\n- $\\frac{M_{ns}}{K_{ns}} = \\frac{10^4}{10^6} = 0.01$\nPlugging these into the expression for $\\delta$:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{0.018}{1 + 0.01 + 2(0.018)} = \\frac{0.018}{1.01 + 0.036} = \\frac{0.018}{1.046}$$\nComputing the numerical value:\n$$\\delta \\approx 0.017208413...$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we obtain $\\delta \\approx 0.01721$.

In fast-growing bacteria, new rounds of replication begin long before the previous one has finished, leading to complex, multi-forked chromosomes. The Cooper-Helmstetter model provides the quintessential framework for understanding this temporal organization. This practice `[@problem_id:2528382]` involves a rigorous derivation from first principles, connecting the microscopic timing of replication initiation ($C$ period) and termination ($D$ period) to macroscopic, measurable properties like the average number of origins per cell and the growth rate ($\\tau$).", "problem": "An Escherichia coli cell has a single circular chromosome that initiates replication at a single origin and terminates near the diametrically opposite terminus. In balanced exponential growth, the cell number increases as $N(t)=N(0)\\exp(\\mu t)$ with specific growth rate $\\mu=\\ln(2)/\\tau$, where $\\tau$ is the generation time. The replication program is temporally organized by two constants: the $C$ period (time from replication initiation to replication termination) and the $D$ period (time from replication termination to cell division). Assume the Cooper–Helmstetter coupling between replication initiation and cell division holds deterministically, replication forks move at constant speed so that termination occurs exactly $C$ minutes after initiation, and the population is asynchronous but in steady state. Also assume that the DNA at the origin is duplicated effectively at the moment of initiation.\n\nUsing only these base assumptions, derive from first principles of balanced exponential growth how the steady-state average copy number per cell of any chromosomal marker depends on the time interval $a$ between that marker’s duplication event and the subsequent cell division of the lineage that produced it.

For a population with generation time $\\tau$, the number of cells grows as $N(t) = N(0) 2^{t/\\tau}$. In this steady state, the fraction of cells with age $x \\in [0, \\tau]$ (time since birth) in the interval $dx$ is given by the normalized age distribution function $P(x)dx$, where\n$$P(x) = \\frac{2 \\ln(2)}{\\tau} 2^{-x/\\tau}$$\nThe average copy number of any marker $M$, denoted $\\langle N_M \\rangle$, is the average of the copy number within a single cell, $g_M(x)$, over this population distribution:\n$$\\langle N_M \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} g_M(x) P(x) dx = \\frac{2 \\ln(2)}{\\tau} \\int_{0}^{\\tau} g_M(x) 2^{-x/\\tau} dx$$\n\nThe problem defines a time interval $a$ between a marker's duplication and the subsequent cell division. Our first task is to determine $g_M(x)$, the number of copies of marker $M$ in a single cell of age $x$. A cell of age $x$ is scheduled to divide at a time $\\tau-x$ in the future. According to the problem's definition, the duplication of marker $M$ for this specific cell division occurs at a time $a$ before the division. Thus, the duplication event happens when the cell's age is $x_{dup} = \\tau - a$. However, this is only true if $0 \\le \\tau-a < \\tau$, which means $0 < a \\le \\tau$. Generally, duplication events related to divisions occur at intervals of $\\tau$. The duplication event for the current cell cycle occurs at an age $x_{dup}$ such that $x_{dup} = \\tau - (a \\pmod \\tau)$. Let $r = a \\pmod \\tau = a - \\tau \\lfloor a/\\tau \\rfloor$. Then $x_{dup} = \\tau - r$.\n\nBefore this duplication event ($x < x_{dup}$), the cell has a certain number of copies of the marker, which it inherited at birth. Let this be $g_M(0)$. After the duplication event ($x \\ge x_{dup}$), the forks have passed the marker, and the number of copies in the cell doubles to $2g_M(0)$. So, the copy number function is a step function:\n$$g_M(x) = \\begin{cases} g_M(0) & \\text{for } 0 \\le x < \\tau-r \\\\ 2g_M(0) & \\text{for } \\tau-r \\le x < \\tau \\end{cases}$$\n\nNext, we must determine $g_M(0)$, the number of copies of the marker in a newborn cell. A newborn cell at time $t=0$ inherits its genetic material from a mother cell that just divided. The number of copies it has, $g_M(0)$, corresponds to the number of chromosomes (partially replicated or not) it receives. In the Cooper-Helmstetter model, replication initiation is tied to future cell divisions. A cell division at time $T$ implies a duplication of marker $M$ occurred at time $T-a$. A newborn cell at $t=0$ is the product of a lineage of divisions at times $0, -\\tau, -2\\tau, \\ldots$. The corresponding marker duplication events for this lineage occurred at times $-a, -a-\\tau, -a-2\\tau, \\ldots$. The number of copies a newborn cell inherits, $g_M(0)$, is equal to the number of replication cycles that have already passed the marker's position but have not yet been segregated by a division. This corresponds to the number of past duplication events in the cell's direct lineage whose corresponding divisions are still in the future. The number of such events is the number of non-negative integers $k$ for which the duplication time $-a-k\\tau$ is in the past, relative to the cell's birth at $t=0$. This is equivalent to counting the number of replication cycles initiated on behalf of the cell before its birth, which have proceeded past marker $M$. The number of such completed M-duplication rounds passed to a newborn cell is $k_M = \\lfloor a/\\tau \\rfloor$. Therefore, the number of copies at birth is:\n$$g_M(0) = 2^{\\lfloor a/\\tau \\rfloor}$$\nNote that this correctly predicts that a newborn cell has $g_{ori}(0) = 2^{\\lfloor (C+D)/\\tau \\rfloor}$ origins and $g_{ter}(0) = 2^{\\lfloor D/\\tau \\rfloor}$ termini.\n\nNow we can calculate the average copy number $\\langle N_M \\rangle$ by substituting $g_M(x)$ into the integral:\n$$\\langle N_M \\rangle = \\frac{2 \\ln(2)}{\\tau} \\left[ \\int_{0}^{\\tau-r} g_M(0) 2^{-x/\\tau} dx + \\int_{\\tau-r}^{\\tau} 2g_M(0) 2^{-x/\\tau} dx \\right]$$\n$$\\langle N_M \\rangle = g_M(0) \\frac{2 \\ln(2)}{\\tau} \\left[ \\left(-\\frac{\\tau}{\\ln 2} 2^{-x/\\tau}\\right)_{0}^{\\tau-r} + 2 \\left(-\\frac{\\tau}{\\ln 2} 2^{-x/\\tau}\\right)_{\\tau-r}^{\\tau} \\right]$$\n$$\\langle N_M \\rangle = -2 g_M(0) \\left[ (2^{-(\\tau-r)/\\tau} - 2^0) + 2(2^{-1} - 2^{-(\\tau-r)/\\tau}) \\right]$$\n$$\\langle N_M \\rangle = -2 g_M(0) \\left[ 2^{-1}2^{r/\\tau} - 1 + 1 - 2 \\cdot 2^{-1}2^{r/\\tau} \\right]$$\n$$\\langle N_M \\rangle = -2 g_M(0) [ 2^{-1}2^{r/\\tau} - 2^{r/\\tau} ] = -2 g_M(0) [-2^{-1}2^{r/\\tau}] = g_M(0) 2^{r/\\tau}$$\nSubstituting $g_M(0) = 2^{\\lfloor a/\\tau \\rfloor}$ and $r = a - \\tau\\lfloor a/\\tau \\rfloor$:\n$$\\langle N_M \\rangle = 2^{\\lfloor a/\\tau \\rfloor} \\cdot 2^{(a - \\tau\\lfloor a/\\tau \\rfloor)/\\tau} = 2^{\\lfloor a/\\tau \\rfloor} \\cdot 2^{a/\\tau} \\cdot 2^{-\\lfloor a/\\tau \\rfloor} = 2^{a/\\tau}$$\nThis is the general formula for the average copy number of a chromosomal marker as a function of $a$.\n\nNow we specialize this result.\n1.  **Average number of replication origins per cell**:\n    The origin is duplicated at the moment of replication initiation. The time from initiation to termination is $C$, and from termination to division is $D$. Thus, initiation precedes division by a total time of $C+D$. For the origin, $a_{ori} = C+D$.\n    The average number of origins per cell is:\n    $$\\langle N_{ori} \\rangle = 2^{a_{ori}/\\tau} = 2^{(C+D)/\\tau}$$\n\n2.  **Origin-to-terminus (ori/ter) copy number ratio**:\n    This is the ratio $\\langle N_{ori} \\rangle / \\langle N_{ter} \\rangle$. We need to find the average copy number of the terminus. Replication terminates at a time $C$ after initiation. Division occurs $D$ minutes after termination. Thus, for the terminus, the time between its duplication (termination) and the subsequent cell division is $a_{ter} = D$.\n    The average number of termini per cell is:\n    $$\\langle N_{ter} \\rangle = 2^{a_{ter}/\\tau} = 2^{D/\\tau}$$\n    The ori/ter ratio is therefore:\n    $$\\frac{\\langle N_{ori} \\rangle}{\\langle N_{ter} \\rangle} = \\frac{2^{(C+D)/\\tau}}{2^{D/\\tau}} = 2^{(C+D)/\\tau - D/\\tau} = 2^{C/\\tau}$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate these expressions for the given parameters: $C=40$ min, $D=20$ min, and $\\tau=30$ min.\n\nAverage number of origins:\n$$\\langle N_{ori} \\rangle = 2^{(40+20)/30} = 2^{60/30} = 2^2 = 4$$\n\nOrigin-to-terminus ratio:\n$$\\text{Ratio} = 2^{40/30} = 2^{4/3}$$\n\nThe results are to be reported as a two-entry row vector $\\big[$average origin number, ori/ter ratio$\\big]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n4 & 2^{4/3}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2528382"}]}
