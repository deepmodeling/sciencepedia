Translation resumes at a specific “resume codon” within the tmRNA tag reading frame and proceeds until the first in-frame stop codon, appending a C-terminal degradation tag (the SsrA tag) to the nascent polypeptide. Consider a rescue event in which the ribosome resumes on the tmRNA message-like domain given below.\n\nThe tmRNA message-like domain is an RNA sequence (written $5^{\\prime}$ to $3^{\\prime}$) with nucleotide positions counted from the first base shown:\n$5^{\\prime}$-ACGUAUGGAGCUAAUGAUGAAAAUUACGCUUUAGCUGCUUAA-$3^{\\prime}$\n\nThe resume codon is defined to start at nucleotide position $10$ (that is, the triplet beginning at position $10$ establishes the reading frame). Assume translation resumes exactly at that codon and continues codon-by-codon in this frame until the first in-frame stop codon is encountered. Use the canonical genetic code.\n\nDefine the appended tag as the peptide segment synthesized from the resume codon up to, but not including, the stop codon. For the purpose of charge calculation, treat this appended tag as internally linked at its N-terminus to the pre-existing nascent chain (that is, no free N-terminal amine on the first residue of the tag) and bearing a free C-terminal carboxyl group at its end.\n\nAt pH $7.0$, compute the net charge (in units of the elementary charge) contributed by this appended tag alone, accounting for ionizable side chains present in the tag (aspartic acid, glutamic acid, histidine, cysteine, tyrosine, lysine, arginine if present) and the free C-terminal carboxyl group of the tag.

The solution necessitates a multi-step process: first, deduce the amino acid sequence of the tag from the provided RNA sequence and translation rules; second, identify all ionizable groups within this peptide; and third, calculate the charge contribution of each group using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and sum them to find the net charge.\n\nFirst, the amino acid sequence of the SsrA tag must be determined. The tmRNA message-like domain sequence is given as $5^{\\prime}$-ACGUAUGGAGCUAAUGAUGAAAAUUACGCUUUAGCUGCUUAA-$3^{\\prime}$. The problem states that translation resumes at a \"resume codon\" starting at nucleotide position $10$. Numbering the sequence from the $5^{\\prime}$ end, the sequence to be translated begins at the $10$th nucleotide.\n\nThe relevant RNA sequence for translation is:\n$$5^{\\prime}-\\text{GCU AAU GAU GAA AAU UAC GCU UUA GCU GCU UAA}-3^{\\prime}$$\n\nThis sequence is translated codon by codon using the canonical genetic code until the first in-frame stop codon is reached.\n- Codon $1$: GCU $\\rightarrow$ Alanine (Ala, A)\n- Codon $2$: AAU $\\rightarrow$ Asparagine (Asn, N)\n- Codon $3$: GAU $\\rightarrow$ Aspartic acid (Asp, D)\n- Codon $4$: GAA $\\rightarrow$ Glutamic acid (Glu, E)\n- Codon $5$: AAU $\\rightarrow$ Asparagine (Asn, N)\n- Codon $6$: UAC $\\rightarrow$ Tyrosine (Tyr, Y)\n- Codon $7$: GCU $\\rightarrow$ Alanine (Ala, A)\n- Codon $8$: UUA $\\rightarrow$ Leucine (Leu, L)\n- Codon $9$: GCU $\\rightarrow$ Alanine (Ala, A)\n- Codon $10$: GCU $\\rightarrow$ Alanine (Ala, A)\n- Codon $11$: UAA $\\rightarrow$ Stop Codon\n\nThe appended tag is defined as the peptide synthesized up to, but not including, the stop codon. Therefore, the resulting peptide tag has the sequence:\nAla-Asn-Asp-Glu-Asn-Tyr-Ala-Leu-Ala-Ala\n\nSecond, the ionizable groups in this peptide tag must be identified. The problem specifies that the N-terminus of the tag is internally linked and thus not a free amine group; it does not contribute to the charge. The C-terminus, corresponding to the final Alanine residue, has a free carboxyl group. We must also consider the ionizable side chains of the amino acids present in the sequence.\n\nThe ionizable groups and their corresponding $pK_a$ values are:\n1.  The C-terminal carboxyl group: $pK_a = 3.1$\n2.  The side chain of Aspartic acid (Asp, D) at position $3$: $pK_a = 3.9$\n3.  The side chain of Glutamic acid (Glu, E) at position $4$: $pK_a = 4.1$\n4.  The side chain of Tyrosine (Tyr, Y) at position $6$: $pK_a = 10.1$\n\nNo other amino acids in the sequence (Ala, Asn, Leu) have ionizable side chains under typical physiological conditions.\n\nThird, the charge of each ionizable group at pH $7.0$ is calculated. The charge of an acidic group ($HA \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + A^-$) is determined by the fraction that is deprotonated ($A^-$). This fraction, $\\alpha$, can be derived from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, $pH = pK_a + \\log_{10}(\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]})$.

The following foundational facts apply: (i) The Central Dogma connects transcription to translation, and translation termination normally requires a class-$1$ release factor with a conserved glycine-glycine-glutamine (GGQ) motif to catalyze hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA ester in the peptidyl transferase center.

The core of the analysis rests on the principle of competitive binding for the A site of a stalled ribosome.\n\n1.  **Function of the Mutant Protein**: The problem states that the $\\text{GGQ}$ motif is catalytic for peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis, as used by class-$1$ release factors and, by extension, $\\text{ArfB}$. The mutation $\\text{GGQ} \\rightarrow \\text{GAQ}$ is known to severely impair or abolish this catalytic activity. However, the problem explicitly states that the mutant's \"ribosome binding determinants\" are preserved. Therefore, the $\\text{ArfB(GAQ)}$ protein is capable of binding to the A site of a stalled ribosome but is unable to perform its function of releasing the nascent polypeptide chain. This makes $\\text{ArfB(GAQ)}$ a classic dominant-negative inhibitor. It acts as a non-productive binder that sequesters the substrate (the stalled ribosome).\n\n2.  **Competition for the A site**: The three rescue systems—$\\text{tmRNA–SmpB}$, $\\text{ArfA–RF}2$, and $\\text{ArfB}$—compete for access to the same binding site. In the engineered strain, the pool of competitors consists of $\\text{tmRNA–SmpB}$, $\\text{ArfA–RF}2$, and the non-functional $\\text{ArfB(GAQ)}$. Because $\\text{ArfB(GAQ)}$ binds but cannot catalyze the release and dissociate, it will have a much longer residence time on the ribosome compared to a functional factor. This prolonged occupancy effectively blocks the A site, preventing the functional rescue factors ($\\text{tmRNA–SmpB}$ and $\\text{ArfA–RF}2$) from binding and resolving the stall. This is a case of competitive inhibition where the inhibitor has a very low dissociation rate once bound.\n\n3.  **Predicted Consequences**:\n    (a) **Distribution of ribosomal complexes**: Ribosomes stalled on non-stop mRNAs will be bound by $\\text{ArfB(GAQ)}$ and trapped in this state. This failure to recycle ribosomes will lead to a significant accumulation of stalled $70\\mathrm{S}$ ribosome-mRNA-peptidyl-tRNA complexes, which are observed as $70\\mathrm{S}$ monosomes in sucrose gradient fractionation. Consequently, the pool of free $30\\mathrm{S}$ and $50\\mathrm{S}$ subunits available for new rounds of translation initiation will decrease. Furthermore, if a leading ribosome stalls and is not cleared, trailing ribosomes on the same mRNA will \"collide\" with it, leading to the formation of disomes and other heavier complexes, a phenomenon termed ribosome collisions. Thus, an accumulation of $70\\mathrm{S}$ monosomes and potentially heavier species is expected.\n\n    (b) **Composition of A-site occupancy**: Due to its long residence time, the catalytically dead $\\text{ArfB(GAQ)}$ will occupy the A site of a large fraction of stalled ribosomes at any given time. The probability of finding a functional factor like $\\text{SmpB}$ or $\\text{RF}2$ in the A site will be greatly diminished. Therefore, A-site occupancy on the population of stalled $70\\mathrm{S}$ ribosomes will be dominated by $\\text{ArfB(GAQ)}$.\n\n    (c) **Fates of nascent chains**: The primary function of all three rescue systems is to release the nascent chain from the tRNA. Since $\\text{ArfB(GAQ)}$ is catalytically inactive and it prevents the other two functional systems from acting, the majority of nascent chains on stalled ribosomes will not be released. They will persist in their ribosome-tethered state as peptidyl-tRNA. The $\\text{tmRNA–SmpB}$ pathway, which adds a degradation tag (the SsrA tag), will be outcompeted. Thus, the rate of SsrA tagging per stalled ribosome will decrease. Similarly, release via the $\\text{ArfA–RF}2$ pathway will also be reduced. The predominant fate of nascent chains from non-stop translation events will be to remain attached to the ribosome.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n-   **A. Accumulation of stalled $70\\mathrm{S}$ monosomes with peptidyl-tRNA whose A sites are frequently occupied by ArfB(GAQ), reducing effective access of tmRNA–SmpB and ArfA–RF2; increased persistence of ribosome-tethered nascent chains and elevated ribosome collisions, with a relative decrease in SsrA tagging per stalled ribosome despite intact tmRNA induction.**\n    This option aligns perfectly with the derived consequences. It correctly identifies the accumulation of stalled $70\\mathrm{S}$ monosomes, the dominant-negative inhibitory effect of $\\text{ArfB(GAQ)}$ occupying the A site, the resulting blockage of functional rescue pathways, the persistence of ribosome-tethered nascent chains, the possibility of ribosome collisions, and the decrease in SsrA tagging. This is a complete and accurate description of the expected phenotype.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **B. Reduction in stalled $70\\mathrm{S}$ monosomes due to complete compensation by tmRNA–SmpB and ArfA–RF2; A sites largely occupied by SmpB or RF2; most nascent chains released rapidly and SsrA-tagged, with minimal accumulation of ribosome-tethered peptidyl-tRNA.**\n    This option incorrectly assumes that the functional redundancy of the pathways leads to complete compensation. It ignores the principle of competitive inhibition. If $\\text{ArfB(GAQ)}$ binds effectively but does not function, it cannot be simply bypassed. It will sequester a significant fraction of the stalled ribosomes, preventing their rescue. Therefore, a reduction in stalled monosomes is the opposite of what is expected.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **C. Predominant accumulation of free $30\\mathrm{S}$ and $50\\mathrm{S}$ subunits due to extensive ribosome splitting prior to rescue; depletion of $70\\mathrm{S}$ monosomes; extensive peptidyl-tRNA drop-off into the cytosol followed by peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase action, yielding largely untagged released proteins.**\n    This option is mechanistically unsound. A block in the rescue of stalled $70\\mathrm{S}$ complexes leads to their accumulation, not their depletion and the subsequent accumulation of free subunits. Accumulation of subunits would imply a defect in translation initiation or an enhancement of recycling, neither of which is the primary defect here. Peptidyl-tRNA \"drop-off\" is a relatively inefficient process compared to the stable stalling of the entire complex. The primary block is on the $70\\mathrm{S}$ ribosome, so this is the species that should accumulate.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D. Little to no change relative to wild type because the redundancy of rescue systems fully masks the GGQ→GAQ mutation; distributions of $70\\mathrm{S}$ monosomes, A-site occupancy, and nascent chain fates remain essentially unchanged under stress.**\n    Similar to option B, this option incorrectly relies on the idea of perfect redundancy. A competitive inhibitor with high affinity (or, more accurately, a low dissociation rate constant) will have a significant impact even in the presence of functional competitors. The problem specifies that the binding determinants of $\\text{ArfB}$ are intact, making it a potent inhibitor. Therefore, \"little to no change\" is a highly improbable outcome. The mutation will induce a strong, dominant-negative phenotype.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis of the biochemical principles of competitive inhibition and ribosome function, option A provides the only consistent and integrated prediction of the experimental outcome.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2530857"}]}
