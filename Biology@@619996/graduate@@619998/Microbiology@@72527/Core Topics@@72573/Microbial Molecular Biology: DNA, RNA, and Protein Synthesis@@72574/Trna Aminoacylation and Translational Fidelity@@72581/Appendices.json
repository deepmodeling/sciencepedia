Hydrolytic editing: $I \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{edit}}} \\text{products}_{\\text{edit}}$\n2.  Transfer to tRNA: $I \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{trans}}} \\text{products}_{\\text{trans}}$\n\nThe total rate of consumption of the intermediate $[I]$ is the sum of the rates of these two parallel pathways, as they are first-order processes. The rate of change of $[I]$ is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{d[I]}{dt} = -(k_{\\text{edit}} + k_{\\text{trans}})[I]\n$$\nThe total rate constant for the decay of the intermediate is $k_{\\text{total}} = k_{\\text{edit}} + k_{\\text{trans}}$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Escape Fraction, $f_{\\text{escape}}$**\n\nThe fraction of molecules that follow a specific pathway in a kinetic partitioning mechanism is the ratio of the rate constant for that pathway to the sum of the rate constants for all competing pathways. This is also known as the branching ratio. The 'escape' from editing is the transfer of valine to tRNA. Thus, the fraction of molecules that escape editing, $f_{\\text{escape}}$, is the rate of the transfer pathway divided by the total rate of consumption of the intermediate.\n$$\nf_{\\text{escape}} = \\frac{\\text{Rate of transfer}}{\\text{Total rate}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{trans}}[I]}{(k_{\\text{edit}} + k_{\\text{trans}})[I]}\n$$\nThe concentration of the intermediate $[I]$ cancels, yielding:\n$$\nf_{\\text{escape}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{trans}}}{k_{\\text{edit}} + k_{\\text{trans}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values, $k_{\\text{edit}} = 20\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$ and $k_{\\text{trans}} = 1\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$:\n$$\nf_{\\text{escape}} = \\frac{1}{20 + 1} = \\frac{1}{21}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Determination of Error Rates**\n\nThe aminoacylation error rate is defined as the ratio of the misacylation flux (formation of $Val\\text{-}tRNA^{Ile}$) to the correctly acylated flux (formation of $Ile\\text{-}tRNA^{Ile}$).\n$$\nE = \\frac{\\text{Flux}_{\\text{misacylation}}}{\\text{Flux}_{\\text{correct acylation}}}\n$$\nThe problem provides the intrinsic activation discrimination ratio, $r$, which is the ratio of the initial activation fluxes before any editing step.\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\text{Flux}_{\\text{misactivation}}}{\\text{Flux}_{\\text{correct activation}}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_{M}}\\right)_{\\text{Val}}[\\text{Val}]}{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_{M}}\\right)_{\\text{Ile}}[\\text{Ile}]}\n$$\nThe quantity $\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_{M}}\\right)[S]$ is proportional to the rate of formation of the aminoacyl-AMP intermediate.\n\n**Error Rate without Editing, $E_{\\text{without}}$**\n\nIn the absence of an editing mechanism, every activated amino acid, whether correct or incorrect, is transferred to tRNA. Therefore, the acylation flux is equal to the activation flux for both pathways. The error rate is simply the ratio of the misactivation flux to the correct activation flux.\n$$\nE_{\\text{without}} = \\frac{\\text{Flux}_{\\text{misactivation}}}{\\text{Flux}_{\\text{correct activation}}} = r\n$$\n\n**Error Rate with Editing, $E_{\\text{with}}$**\n\nWith pre-transfer editing, the misactivation flux is partitioned. Only the fraction $f_{\\text{escape}}$ of misactivated valine molecules proceeds to the tRNA transfer step, resulting in misacylation. The correct substrate, isoleucine, is assumed to not be subject to editing, so its acylation flux remains equal to its activation flux.\nThe misacylation flux is therefore the initial misactivation flux multiplied by the escape fraction:\n$$\n\\text{Flux}_{\\text{misacylation}} = f_{\\text{escape}} \\times \\text{Flux}_{\\text{misactivation}}\n$$\nThe error rate with editing is then:\n$$\nE_{\\text{with}} = \\frac{f_{\\text{escape}} \\times \\text{Flux}_{\\text{misactivation}}}{\\text{Flux}_{\\text{correct activation}}} = f_{\\text{escape}} \\times \\left(\\frac{\\text{Flux}_{\\text{misactivation}}}{\\text{Flux}_{\\text{correct activation}}}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the definitions of $f_{\\text{escape}}$ and $r$:\n$$\nE_{\\text{with}} = f_{\\text{escape}} \\cdot r = \\frac{1}{21} r\n$$\nThe problem requires the final result as a row vector containing $f_{\\text{escape}}$, $E_{\\text{with}}$, and $E_{\\text{without}}$.

This parameter quantifies how efficiently an enzyme converts a substrate to product at low substrate concentrations.
