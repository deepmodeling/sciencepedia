Because B-form Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) has a helical twist of approximately $10.5$ base pairs per turn, the relative rotational orientation of these sites depends on the spacer length $L$ (in base pairs) between the centers of the $-35$ and $-10$ elements. Assume that each additional base pair rotates the downstream site by a fixed angle relative to the upstream site. Further assume that the sigma factor makes strongest simultaneous contact when the relative rotational orientation matches a required geometry, and that small deviations from this required orientation incur a harmonic energetic penalty.\n\nStarting from the following foundational facts:\n- Central Dogma context: transcription initiation requires recognition of promoter elements by RNAP and sigma factor.\n- B-form DNA twist: $10.5$ base pairs per turn (constant helical twist over the spacer).\n- Small-angle energetic cost: for a misalignment angle $\\Delta\\theta$ (in radians), the penalty is $E=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\kappa\\,\\Delta\\theta^{2}$, where $\\kappa$ is an effective torsional coupling constant in units of $k_{B}T$ per radian squared.\n\nDo the following:\n1.

The model of a bacterial promoter with $-35$ and $-10$ elements separated by a spacer is a cornerstone of molecular biology. The value of $10.5$ base pairs per turn is the accepted standard for B-form DNA in solution. The concept of an energetic penalty for non-optimal geometric configurations is a fundamental principle in chemical physics, and the harmonic approximation ($E \\propto \\Delta\\theta^2$) is standard for small perturbations from equilibrium. The values provided for spacer length ($L_0=17$) and torsional stiffness are physically realistic. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and clear, objective questions that lead to a unique, verifiable solution. It does not violate any scientific principles, nor does it contain internal contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nVerdict: The problem is valid. A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Angular increment and orientation dependence.\nA complete turn of B-form DNA corresponds to a rotation of $2\\pi$ radians and spans a length of $10.5$ base pairs. The angular increment per base pair, denoted by $\\alpha$, is therefore the total angle of a turn divided by the number of base pairs per turn.\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{2\\pi \\text{ rad}}{10.5 \\text{ bp}} $$\nThe relative angle between two points on the DNA helix separated by a spacer of length $L$ base pairs is the product of the length $L$ and the angular increment per base pair $\\alpha$. Let us denote this total angle as $\\theta(L)$.\n$$ \\theta(L) = \\alpha L = \\frac{2\\pi L}{10.5} $$\nThe \"rotational orientation\" or \"phasing\" of the $-10$ site relative to the $-35$ site is determined by this angle $\\theta(L)$. Because a rotation by any integer multiple of $2\\pi$ results in an identical orientation, the effective phasing is determined by $\\theta(L)$ modulo $2\\pi$. Therefore, the relative orientation between the $-35$ and $-10$ sites depends linearly on the spacer length $L$, with a periodicity dictated by the helical twist of the DNA.\n\nPart 2: Smallest misalignment angle.\nThe problem states that the promoter is optimally phased at a reference spacer length $L_0 = 17$. This implies that the angle $\\theta(L_0) = \\alpha L_0$ represents the ideal geometry for the sigma factor to bind both sites simultaneously. At any other spacer length $L$, the orientation is $\\theta(L) = \\alpha L$. The angular deviation from the optimal orientation is $\\theta(L) - \\theta(L_0) = \\alpha(L-L_0)$.\n\nHowever, the protein-DNA interaction is insensitive to full rotations of the DNA helix. An angular deviation of $\\alpha(L-L_0)$ is functionally equivalent to a deviation of $\\alpha(L-L_0) - 2\\pi n$ for any integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The energetic penalty is associated with the torsional stress required to achieve proper alignment. This stress corresponds to the smallest possible rotation needed to restore the optimal phasing. Thus, the relevant misalignment angle, $\\Delta\\theta(L)$, is the absolute value of the angular deviation minimized over all possible full turns. This corresponds precisely to the expression given in the problem statement:\n$$ \\Delta\\theta(L) = \\min_{n\\in\\mathbb{Z}} \\left| \\alpha(L-L_0) - 2\\pi n \\right| $$\nThe units for this angle, and for all angular measures in this derivation, are radians. This is required for consistency with the formula for energetic penalty, $E=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\kappa\\,\\Delta\\theta^{2}$, which is valid for angles in radians.\n\nPart 3: Calculation of energetic penalty.\nWe are given the parameters $\\kappa = 4.0 \\, k_{B}T/\\text{rad}^2$, $L_0 = 17$, and we are to compute the penalty for $L = 18$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the angular increment $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{2\\pi}{10.5} \\, \\text{rad}/\\text{bp} $$\nNext, we calculate the total angular deviation before considering the $2\\pi$ periodicity:\n$$ \\alpha(L-L_0) = \\frac{2\\pi}{10.5}(18-17) = \\frac{2\\pi}{10.5} \\, \\text{rad} $$\nNow, we find the smallest misalignment angle $\\Delta\\theta$ for $L=18$:\n$$ \\Delta\\theta(18) = \\min_{n\\in\\mathbb{Z}} \\left| \\frac{2\\pi}{10.5} - 2\\pi n \\right| = 2\\pi \\min_{n\\in\\mathbb{Z}} \\left| \\frac{1}{10.5} - n \\right| $$\nThe quantity $|\\frac{1}{10.5} - n|$ is minimized when the integer $n$ is closest to $\\frac{1}{10.5} \\approx 0.095$. The closest integer is $n=0$.\nTherefore, the smallest misalignment angle is:\n$$ \\Delta\\theta = \\left| \\frac{2\\pi}{10.5} - 2\\pi(0) \\right| = \\frac{2\\pi}{10.5} \\, \\text{rad} $$\nFinally, we compute the energetic penalty $E$ using the given formula:\n$$ E = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa (\\Delta\\theta)^2 $$\nSubstituting the values for $\\kappa$ and $\\Delta\\theta$:\n$$ E = \\frac{1}{2} (4.0 \\, k_B T) \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{10.5} \\right)^2 $$\n$$ E = 2.0 \\left( \\frac{4\\pi^2}{10.5^2} \\right) k_B T = \\frac{8\\pi^2}{110.25} k_B T $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value.\n$$ E \\approx \\frac{8 \\times (3.14159)^2}{110.25} k_B T \\approx \\frac{8 \\times 9.8696044}{110.25} k_B T $$\n$$ E \\approx \\frac{78.956835}{110.25} k_B T \\approx 0.71616177 \\, k_B T $$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, the energetic penalty is $0.716 \\, k_B T$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.716}$$", "id": "2476904"}, {"introduction": "In the complex environment of a bacterial cell, transcription is not just about a single promoter but about a global competition for limited resources.

Let $x = [R]$ for notational simplicity:\n$$R_{\\text{tot}}(K_{d,1} + x)(K_{d,2} + x) = x(K_{d,1} + x)(K_{d,2} + x) + xS_{1,\\text{tot}}(K_{d,2} + x) + xS_{2,\\text{tot}}(K_{d,1} + x)$$\nExpanding and collecting terms by powers of $x$ leads to the standard form of a cubic equation, $Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx + D = 0$:\n$$x^3 + \\left( K_{d,1} + K_{d,2} + S_{1,\\text{tot}} + S_{2,\\text{tot}} - R_{\\text{tot}} \\right)x^2 + \\left( K_{d,1}K_{d,2} + K_{d,2}S_{1,\\text{tot}} + K_{d,1}S_{2,\\text{tot}} - R_{\\text{tot}}(K_{d,1} + K_{d,2}) \\right)x - R_{\\text{tot}}K_{d,1}K_{d,2} = 0$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values (all in nM, so units can be omitted for calculation):\n$R_{\\text{tot}} = 200$, $S_{1,\\text{tot}} = 100$, $S_{2,\\text{tot}} = 300$, $K_{d,1} = 20$, $K_{d,2} = 50$.\n\nThe coefficients of the cubic equation for $[R]$ are:\n$A = 1$\n$B = (20 + 50) + (100 + 300) - 200 = 70 + 400 - 200 = 270$\n$C = (20)(50) + (50)(100) + (20)(300) - 200(20 + 50) = 1000 + 5000 + 6000 - 200(70) = 12000 - 14000 = -2000$\n$D = -200(20)(50) = -200000$\n\nThe equation to be solved is:\n$$[R]^3 + 270[R]^2 - 2000[R] - 200000 = 0$$\n\nThis equation has one physically meaningful root, which must be real and positive. Numerical solution of this cubic equation yields:\n$$[R] \\approx 29.39863~\\mathrm{nM}$$\n\nUsing this value for the free core RNAP concentration, we can now compute the concentrations of the two complexes:\n$$[RS_1] = \\frac{[R] S_{1,\\text{tot}}}{K_{d,1} + [R]} = \\frac{(29.39863)(100)}{20 + 29.39863} = \\frac{2939.863}{49.39863} \\approx 59.51395~\\mathrm{nM}$$\n$$[RS_2] = \\frac{[R] S_{2,\\text{tot}}}{K_{d,2} + [R]} = \\frac{(29.39863)(300)}{50 + 29.39863} = \\frac{8819.589}{79.39863} \\approx 111.07994~\\mathrm{nM}$$\n\nThe problem requires the fractions of total core RNAP bound to each sigma factor. Let these fractions be $f_1$ and $f_2$.\n$$f_1 = \\frac{[RS_1]}{R_{\\text{tot}}} = \\frac{59.51395}{200} \\approx 0.29756975$$\n$$f_2 = \\frac{[RS_2]}{R_{\\text{tot}}} = \\frac{111.07994}{200} \\approx 0.5553997$$\n\nRounding these results to four significant figures as requested:\n$f_1 \\approx 0.2976$\n$f_2 \\approx 0.5554$\n\nThese are the final answers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.2976 & 0.5554 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2476956"}]}
