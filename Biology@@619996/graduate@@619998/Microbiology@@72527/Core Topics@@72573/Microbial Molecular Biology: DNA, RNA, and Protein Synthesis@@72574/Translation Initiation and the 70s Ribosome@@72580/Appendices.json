In this saturation regime, $P_{\\text{duplex}}^{(\\text{A})}$ and $P_{\\text{duplex}}^{(\\text{B})}$ are both extremely close to $1$, making their ratio $r$ also approximately $1$. This result is physically unreasonable, as it implies that a significant change in binding affinity has no effect on the rate.\n\nA more chemically sound interpretation, common in this context, is that the problem statement \"rate is proportional to the equilibrium probability\" is a simplification for \"rate is proportional to the equilibrium constant $K_{eq}$.\" This is valid under the assumption that the system is not saturated; for example, if the concentration of the unbound reactant is held constant and is not significantly depleted. This implies a relationship of the form $k_{\\text{init}} \\propto K_{eq}$, which corresponds to the weak binding limit, $P_{\\text{duplex}} \\approx K_{eq}$.
