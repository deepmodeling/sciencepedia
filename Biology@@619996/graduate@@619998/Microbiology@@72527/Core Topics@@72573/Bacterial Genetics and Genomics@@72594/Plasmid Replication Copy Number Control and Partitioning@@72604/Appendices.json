Assume the following fundamental ingredients:\n- Each plasmid initiates replication at a rate $k_i(C)$ that depends on the concentration $C$ of an inhibitory regulator, with $k_i(C)$ decreasing as $C$ increases due to negative feedback from a copy-numberâ€“proportional inhibitor.\n- Cell growth results in dilution of intracellular components at a constant specific rate $\\mu$ (per minute), so that in the absence of replication, $N(t)$ would decay as $\\exp(-\\mu t)$.\n- At the population-average scale, $N(t)$ obeys the deterministic balance $dN/dt = \\big(k_i(C)-\\mu\\big) N$, reflecting replication initiation per plasmid and first-order dilution by growth.\n- The inhibitor is produced proportionally to the plasmid copy number and equilibrates rapidly relative to copy-number dynamics, such that its concentration is proportional to $N$, and, by choice of units, we take $C=N$.\n\nSuppose the initiation rate has the hyperbolic form $k_i(C) = \\dfrac{k_0}{1+\\alpha C}$, with $k_0$ the maximal initiation rate in the absence of inhibitor, and $\\alpha$ a dimensionless feedback strength parameter.

It is well-posed, with all necessary equations and parameters provided to find a unique steady-state solution and its sensitivity. The language is objective and precise. The parameter values are biologically plausible. The problem is a standard exercise in dynamical systems analysis as applied to molecular biology, and thus is not trivial, ill-posed, or scientifically unsound. The problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nWe are tasked with finding the nonzero steady-state copy number, $N^{\\ast}$, and its local sensitivity to the feedback strength parameter, $S = \\dfrac{dN^{\\ast}}{d\\alpha}$.\n\n**Part 1: Steady-State Copy Number $N^{\\ast}$**\n\nThe dynamics of the mean copy number $N$ are described by the ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = \\big(k_i(C) - \\mu\\big) N $$\nWe are given that the inhibitor concentration $C$ is taken to be equal to the copy number $N$, so $C=N$. The initiation rate is $k_i(N) = \\dfrac{k_0}{1+\\alpha N}$. Substituting these into the dynamical equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = \\left( \\frac{k_0}{1+\\alpha N} - \\mu \\right) N $$\nA steady state, denoted $N^{\\ast}$, is a value of $N$ for which the system does not change over time, meaning $\\dfrac{dN}{dt} = 0$.\n$$ \\left( \\frac{k_0}{1+\\alpha N^{\\ast}} - \\mu \\right) N^{\\ast} = 0 $$\nThis equation has two solutions. The first is the trivial solution $N^{\\ast} = 0$, which corresponds to plasmid loss from the population. The problem asks for the nonzero steady state, which is found by setting the term in the parenthesis to zero:\n$$ \\frac{k_0}{1+\\alpha N^{\\ast}} - \\mu = 0 $$\nThis condition represents the balance between the rate of plasmid replication initiation, $k_i(N^{\\ast})$, and the rate of plasmid dilution due to cell growth, $\\mu$. At steady state, these two rates must be equal. We now solve for $N^{\\ast}$:\n$$ \\frac{k_0}{1+\\alpha N^{\\ast}} = \\mu $$\n$$ k_0 = \\mu(1+\\alpha N^{\\ast}) $$\n$$ \\frac{k_0}{\\mu} = 1+\\alpha N^{\\ast} $$\n$$ \\alpha N^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_0}{\\mu} - 1 $$\nThis yields the explicit expression for the nonzero steady-state copy number $N^{\\ast}$ as a function of the model parameters:\n$$ N^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( \\frac{k_0}{\\mu} - 1 \\right) $$\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the given parameter values: $k_0 = 0.4$, $\\mu = 0.02$, and $\\alpha = 0.1$.\n$$ N^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{0.1} \\left( \\frac{0.4}{0.02} - 1 \\right) $$\n$$ N^{\\ast} = 10 \\left( 20 - 1 \\right) $$\n$$ N^{\\ast} = 10 \\times 19 = 190 $$\nThe steady-state copy number is $190$ plasmids per cell.\n\n**Part 2: Local Sensitivity $S$**\n\nThe second task is to compute the local sensitivity of the steady-state copy number $N^{\\ast}$ with respect to the feedback strength parameter $\\alpha$. This is defined as the partial derivative $S = \\dfrac{dN^{\\ast}}{d\\alpha}$, holding $k_0$ and $\\mu$ constant.\nWe start with the derived expression for $N^{\\ast}$:\n$$ N^{\\ast}(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( \\frac{k_0}{\\mu} - 1 \\right) = \\left( \\frac{k_0}{\\mu} - 1 \\right) \\alpha^{-1} $$\nWe differentiate this expression with respect to $\\alpha$:\n$$ S = \\frac{dN^{\\ast}}{d\\alpha} = \\frac{d}{d\\alpha} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{k_0}{\\mu} - 1 \\right) \\alpha^{-1} \\right] $$\n$$ S = \\left( \\frac{k_0}{\\mu} - 1 \\right) (-1) \\alpha^{-2} $$\n$$ S = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha^2} \\left( \\frac{k_0}{\\mu} - 1 \\right) $$\nAn alternative and simpler form for evaluation can be found by substituting the expression for $N^{\\ast}$ back into the expression for $S$: since $N^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( \\frac{k_0}{\\mu} - 1 \\right)$, it follows that $\\left( \\frac{k_0}{\\mu} - 1 \\right) = \\alpha N^{\\ast}$. Substituting this gives:\n$$ S = -\\frac{\\alpha N^{\\ast}}{\\alpha^2} = -\\frac{N^{\\ast}}{\\alpha} $$\nNow we evaluate $S$ using the previously calculated value $N^{\\ast} = 190$ and the given value $\\alpha = 0.1$:\n$$ S = -\\frac{190}{0.1} = -1900 $$\n\nInterpretation: The sensitivity $S$ is negative, which is consistent with the role of $\\alpha$ as a feedback strength parameter. A negative sign means that an increase in $\\alpha$ (stronger negative feedback) leads to a decrease in the steady-state copy number $N^{\\ast}$. The magnitude of $S = -1900$ implies that near the operating point $\\alpha=0.1$, a small increase in $\\alpha$ by an amount $\\Delta\\alpha$ would cause the copy number to decrease by approximately $1900 \\times \\Delta\\alpha$. This indicates a high sensitivity of the copy number to changes in the inhibitor's effectiveness.\n\nThe final answer requires the numerical values of $N^{\\ast}$ and $S$ reported as a row matrix.\n$$ N^{\\ast} = 190 $$\n$$ S = -1900 $$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 190 & -1900 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2523365"}, {"introduction": "After regulating their copy number, plasmids must be physically segregated into daughter cells during division.

It is a straightforward application of fundamental probability theory to a well-established biological model. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the probability that a specific daughter cell, which we shall call Daughter A, receives zero plasmids out of a total of $C$ plasmids.\n\nLet us define the event of interest for a single plasmid molecule. For the $i$-th plasmid, where $i$ is an integer from $1$ to $C$, let $A_i$ be the event that plasmid $i$ localizes to Daughter A, and let $B_i$ be the event that it localizes to Daughter B.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the probabilities of these events are:\n$P(A_i) = p = 0.5$\n$P(B_i) = 1 - p = 0.5$\n\nThe outcome where Daughter A receives zero plasmids is the event where every single plasmid, from $1$ to $C$, localizes to Daughter B. This compound event is the intersection of all individual events $B_i$:\n$$ \\text{Event}(\\text{zero plasmids in A}) = B_1 \\cap B_2 \\cap \\dots \\cap B_C $$\n\nThe problem critically states that the plasmid molecules localize independently. The multiplicative rule of probability for independent events states that the probability of the intersection of a set of independent events is the product of their individual probabilities.\nApplying this rule, we have:\n$$ P(B_1 \\cap B_2 \\cap \\dots \\cap B_C) = P(B_1) \\times P(B_2) \\times \\dots \\times P(B_C) $$\n\nSince the probability $P(B_i)$ is the same for all plasmids, equal to $0.5$, we can substitute this value into the product:\n$$ P(\\text{zero plasmids in A}) = \\underbrace{0.5 \\times 0.5 \\times \\dots \\times 0.5}_{C \\text{ times}} $$\n\nThis product of $C$ identical terms is equivalent to raising the probability $0.5$ to the power of $C$:\n$$ P(\\text{zero plasmids in A}) = (0.5)^C $$\n\nTo express this in a simplified analytical form, we can write the decimal $0.5$ as a fraction $\\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$ (0.5)^C = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^C = \\frac{1^C}{2^C} = \\frac{1}{2^C} $$\n\nThis expression can be further simplified using a negative exponent:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2^C} = 2^{-C} $$\n\nThis derivation relies only on the definition of independent events and the multiplicative rule of probability, as required by the problem statement.

It is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters ($C=2$, $P(S)=0.9$) and a clear definition of the quantity $L$ to be computed. The problem is objective and contains no logical contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nWe proceed with the solution.\n\nThe segregational loss rate, $L$, is defined as the expected fraction of daughter cells that are plasmid-free. Since a single division event produces two daughter cells, let us denote them $D_1$ and $D_2$. By symmetry, the probability that $D_1$ is plasmid-free is the same as the probability that $D_2$ is plasmid-free. The expected fraction of plasmid-free cells is then equal to the probability that any single, arbitrarily chosen daughter cell is plasmid-free.\nLet $A$ be the event that an arbitrary daughter cell is plasmid-free. We must compute $L = P(A)$.\n\nWe use the law of total probability, conditioning on the two mutually exclusive outcomes of the partitioning process: successful engagement ($S$) and failure ($F$).\n$$L = P(A) = P(A|S)P(S) + P(A|F)P(F)$$\nThe probabilities of these events are given as $P(S) = 0.9$ and $P(F) = 1 - P(S) = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1$.\n\nWe must now evaluate the conditional probabilities $P(A|S)$ and $P(A|F)$.\n\nCase 1: Successful partitioning (event $S$).\nThe problem states that upon successful engagement of the ParABS system, the $C=2$ plasmids are allocated one to each daughter cell. Therefore, both daughter cells receive exactly one plasmid. The number of plasmid-free daughter cells is zero. The probability of an arbitrary daughter cell being plasmid-free, given success, is therefore zero.\n$$P(A|S) = 0$$\n\nCase 2: Failed partitioning (event $F$).\nThe problem states that upon failure, the $C=2$ plasmids segregate randomly and independently. For a specific daughter cell (say, $D_1$) to be plasmid-free, all $C=2$ plasmids must segregate to the other daughter cell ($D_2$).\nLet $p_1$ and $p_2$ be the two plasmids. The probability that plasmid $p_1$ segregates to $D_2$ is $1/2$. The probability that plasmid $p_2$ segregates to $D_2$ is also $1/2$. Since these events are independent, the probability that both $p_1$ and $p_2$ segregate to $D_2$ (leaving $D_1$ plasmid-free) is the product of their individual probabilities.\n$$P(A|F) = P(D_1 \\text{ is free}) = P(p_1 \\to D_2 \\text{ and } p_2 \\to D_2) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these conditional probabilities back into the expression for $L$.\n$$L = P(A|S)P(S) + P(A|F)P(F)$$\n$$L = (0)(0.9) + \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)(0.1)$$\n$$L = 0 + \\frac{0.1}{4} = \\frac{1/10}{4} = \\frac{1}{40}$$\n\nThe segregational loss rate per division, $L$, is exactly $1/40$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{40}}$$", "id": "2523351"}]}
