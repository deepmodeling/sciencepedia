The transposase introduces a pair of nicks on opposite strands of the target DNA that are offset along the helical axis by a separation of $s$ nucleotides (so that one strand is cut at a position indexed $i$ and the complementary strand is cut at position indexed $i+s$, with $s \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$). After strand transfer, the IS element is covalently joined to the phosphodiester backbone at the two recessed ends, leaving single-stranded gaps adjacent to each IS end. The host DNA polymerase fills these gaps by templated synthesis, and DNA ligase seals the nicks, producing a characteristic target site duplication (TSD) flanking the inserted IS on both sides.\n\nStarting only from the following foundational principles:\n- Complementary base pairing constrains gap filling to restore duplex DNA without mismatches.\n- DNA polymerase fills single-stranded gaps precisely to the extent required for complete base pairing between the two strands.\n- The offset between the two original nicks is $s$ nucleotides.\n\nDerive the expected length $L_{\\mathrm{TSD}}$ of the target site duplication as a function of the stagger size $s$.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "We begin by formalizing the geometry of the staggered cuts and the subsequent repair. Let the target double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) be represented by two antiparallel strands. Define an index along the top strand so that the transposase introduces a nick between positions $i$ and $i+1$ on the top strand, and between positions $i+s$ and $i+s+1$ on the bottom strand. By construction, the two nicks are offset by $s$ nucleotides along the sequence, where $s \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ is the stagger size set by the transposase active site geometry.\n\nAfter strand transfer, the insertion sequence (IS) ends are ligated to the exposed ends of the target DNA. Because the original cuts are staggered, this ligation yields single-stranded gaps flanking each end of the inserted IS. Specifically, consider the left junction: one strand of the target DNA adjacent to the IS remains continuous, while the complementary strand exhibits a single-stranded gap spanning exactly the region between the two offset cut positions projected onto that junction. The linear extent of this gap is $s$ nucleotides, since the distance between the nicked positions on opposite strands was $s$ nucleotides.\n\nBy the principle of complementary base pairing and the action of DNA polymerase, gap filling proceeds by copying the sequence from the intact complementary strand across the single-stranded region. DNA polymerase will synthesize precisely as many nucleotides as required to restore complete base pairing, neither fewer (which would leave single-stranded segments) nor more (which would create mismatches or displace paired regions). Therefore, at each junction, the polymerase fills a gap of length $s$ nucleotides.\n\nThis templated synthesis effectively duplicates the sequence of the target DNA that lies within the span of the gap. Because this occurs symmetrically at both the left and right junctions, the same contiguous run of $s$ nucleotides from the target site is present adjacent to both ends of the inserted IS after repair. By definition, the target site duplication (TSD) length, $L_{\\mathrm{TSD}}$, is the number of nucleotides duplicated on each side of the insertion.\n\nThus, the duplication length equals the size of the single-stranded gap produced by the staggered cuts, which is exactly the stagger size $s$. Formally,\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{TSD}}(s) = s.\n$$\nThis result is independent of whether the stagger yields $5^{\\prime}$ or $3^{\\prime}$ overhangs; the key determinant is the offset $s$ between the two cuts, which sets the gap length that polymerase must fill and hence the length of duplicated sequence.\n\nTherefore, the expected TSD length as a function of the stagger size is given by $L_{\\mathrm{TSD}} = s$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{s}$$", "id": "2502858"}, {"introduction": "While we can study individual transposition events, it is crucial to understand their population-level dynamics.

The terminology is precise, and the question is well-posed, asking for a calculable quantity (a steady-state expectation) based on the provided parameters. The problem is free from contradictions, ambiguities, and factual errors. It is deemed **valid**.\n\n**3. Solution Derivation:**\nLet $N_t$ be the random variable for the number of IS copies at generation $t$. The number of copies at the next generation, $t+1$, can be expressed by the following recurrence relation:\n$$N_{t+1} = N_t + I_t - L_t$$\nwhere $I_t$ is the random variable for the number of new insertions gained during the transition from generation $t$ to $t+1$, and $L_t$ is the random variable for the number of existing copies lost during the same period.\n\nThe objective is to find the steady-state expected value, $N^{\\ast}$. We begin by taking the expectation of the entire recurrence equation. By the linearity of expectation, we have:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[N_{t+1}] = \\mathbb{E}[N_t + I_t - L_t] = \\mathbb{E}[N_t] + \\mathbb{E}[I_t] - \\mathbb{E}[L_t]$$\nNow, we must determine the expectations $\\mathbb{E}[I_t]$ and $\\mathbb{E}[L_t]$.\n\nThe term $\\mathbb{E}[I_t]$ represents the expected number of new insertions. The problem states that new insertions occur \"with a genome-wide mean rate $\\alpha$ per generation\". This is given as a constant mean rate. Therefore:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[I_t] = \\alpha$$\n\nThe term $\\mathbb{E}[L_t]$ represents the expected number of copies lost. The loss process depends on the number of copies present at generation $t$, which is the random variable $N_t$. The problem states that \"each existing copy is independently lost with probability $\\beta$\". For a given number of copies $N_t = n$, the number of losses is a random variable that follows a binomial distribution, $L_t | (N_t=n) \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, \\beta)$. The expectation of this conditional distribution is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[L_t | N_t=n] = n\\beta$$\nThis can be written more generally for the random variable $N_t$ as:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[L_t | N_t] = \\beta N_t$$\nTo find the unconditional expectation $\\mathbb{E}[L_t]$, we use the law of total expectation: $\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[X|Y]]$. Applying this here:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[L_t] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[L_t | N_t]] = \\mathbb{E}[\\beta N_t]$$\nSince $\\beta$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the expectation:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[L_t] = \\beta \\mathbb{E}[N_t]$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\mathbb{E}[I_t]$ and $\\mathbb{E}[L_t]$ back into the equation for $\\mathbb{E}[N_{t+1}]$ yields a recurrence relation for the expected copy number:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[N_{t+1}] = \\mathbb{E}[N_t] + \\alpha - \\beta \\mathbb{E}[N_t]$$\n$$\\mathbb{E}[N_{t+1}] = (1 - \\beta) \\mathbb{E}[N_t] + \\alpha$$\nAt steady state, the expected copy number is constant over time. This is the condition specified in the problem: $\\mathbb{E}[N_{t+1}] = \\mathbb{E}[N_t] = N^{\\ast}$. We substitute $N^{\\ast}$ into the recurrence relation:\n$$N^{\\ast} = (1 - \\beta) N^{\\ast} + \\alpha$$\nWe now solve this algebraic equation for $N^{\\ast}$.\n$$N^{\\ast} - (1 - \\beta) N^{\\ast} = \\alpha$$\n$$N^{\\ast} - N^{\\ast} + \\beta N^{\\ast} = \\alpha$$\n$$\\beta N^{\\ast} = \\alpha$$\nAssuming a non-zero loss rate, $\\beta \\neq 0$, which is necessary for a non-divergent steady state to exist, we can divide by $\\beta$:\n$$N^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}$$\nThis expression represents the steady-state expected copy number, which is the dynamic equilibrium point where the expected number of new insertions per generation ($\\alpha$) is exactly balanced by the expected number of losses per generation ($\\beta N^{\\ast}$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}}$$", "id": "2502835"}, {"introduction": "The theoretical principles of transposition come to life when analyzing real genomic data.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular biology, specifically the structure of composite transposons, and presents a well-posed computational task. The definitions are clear, the constraints are consistent, and the objective is formalizable. I will now provide the solution.\n\nThe objective is to devise a computational procedure for identifying composite transposons within a given Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) sequence, referred to as a read. A composite transposon is defined as a structure where a central cargo gene is flanked by two Insertion Sequence ($IS$) elements. The entire structure must be contained within a single read. The algorithm must determine if such a structure exists and, if so, report its properties based on a minimal span criterion.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the components. The DNA is a string over the alphabet $\\{A, C, G, T\\}$. We are given a canonical forward sequence for the $IS$ element, denoted $IS_{fwd}$, and for the cargo gene, $cargo_{fwd}$. The orientation of any sequence is determined by matching either its forward representation or its reverse complement. The reverse complement of a sequence $S$, denoted $S_{rev}$, is found by reversing $S$ and substituting each base with its complement according to the rules $A \\leftrightarrow T$ and $C \\leftrightarrow G$. This gives us four patterns to search for: $IS_{fwd}$, $IS_{rev}$, $cargo_{fwd}$, and $cargo_{rev}$.\n\nThe core of the algorithm is a systematic search and evaluation process.\n\n$1$. **Identification of Occurrences**: For a given DNA read, the first step is to identify all occurrences of the four defined patterns. An occurrence is characterized by its $0$-based start index, $i$, and its orientation, $\\sigma$, where we assign $\\sigma = 1$ for a forward sequence and $\\sigma = -1$ for a reverse complement. This step involves a string search algorithm to find every start index for each of the four patterns. This yields two sets of occurrences: one for all $IS$ elements, $\\mathcal{I} = \\{(i_{IS}, \\sigma_{IS})_k\\}$, and one for all cargo genes, $\\mathcal{C} = \\{(i_{cargo}, \\sigma_{cargo})_j\\}$.\n\n$2$. **Formation of Valid Triplets**: A valid composite transposon triplet consists of a left $IS$ element, a cargo gene, and a right $IS$ element, denoted $(IS_L, Cargo, IS_R)$. A triplet is considered valid if the start index of the left $IS$ is strictly less than the start index of the cargo, and the start index of the right $IS$ is strictly greater than the start index of the cargo. That is, $i_{IS, L} < i_{cargo} < i_{IS, R}$.\n\n$3$. **Minimal Span Selection Criterion**: The problem requires selecting, from all possible valid triplets across the entire read, the single triplet that minimizes the span. The span, $S$, is defined as the difference between the start indices of the flanking $IS$ elements: $S = i_{IS, R} - i_{IS, L}$.\n\n$4$. **Algorithmic Optimization**: A naive search over all combinations of three occurrences would be computationally inefficient. A more structured approach significantly improves performance. We can iterate through each identified cargo occurrence $(i_{cargo}, \\sigma_{cargo}) \\in \\mathcal{C}$. For each cargo, we identify the set of all possible left $IS$ elements, $\\mathcal{I}_L = \\{ (i_{IS}, \\sigma_{IS}) \\in \\mathcal{I} | i_{IS} < i_{cargo} \\}$, and the set of all possible right $IS$ elements, $\\mathcal{I}_R = \\{ (i_{IS}, \\sigma_{IS}) \\in \\mathcal{I} | i_{IS} > i_{cargo} \\}$. If either $\\mathcal{I}_L$ or $\\mathcal{I}_R$ is empty, no transposon can be formed around this particular cargo.\n\nFor a non-empty $\\mathcal{I}_L$ and $\\mathcal{I}_R$, to minimize the span $S = i_{IS, R} - i_{IS, L}$, one must choose the largest possible $i_{IS, L}$ and the smallest possible $i_{IS, R}$. Therefore, for a given cargo, the optimal flanking pair consists of the right-most left $IS$ and the left-most right $IS$. Let these be $IS_L^* = \\text{argmax}_{is \\in \\mathcal{I}_L} \\{i_{IS}\\}$ and $IS_R^* = \\text{argmin}_{is \\in \\mathcal{I}_R} \\{i_{IS}\\}$. We calculate the span $S_{cargo} = i_{IS_R^*} - i_{IS_L^*}$ for this optimal local pairing.\n\nWe perform this calculation for every cargo occurrence in $\\mathcal{C}$ and keep track of the global minimum span found so far, $S_{min}$, and the associated triplet. After evaluating all cargoes, the triplet corresponding to $S_{min}$ is the solution.\n\n$5$. **Reporting**: Based on the selected triplet $(IS_L^*, Cargo^*, IS_R^*)$, we generate the report $[b, o, g, \\ell, r]$ as follows:\n- $b = 1$, indicating a composite transposon was detected.\n- $o = 1$ if the orientations of the flanking $IS$ elements are the same ($\\sigma_{IS, L^*} = \\sigma_{IS, R^*}$), which is a 'direct' orientation. $o = -1$ if they are different ($\\sigma_{IS, L^*} \\neq \\sigma_{IS, R^*}$), which is an 'inverted' orientation.\n- $g = \\sigma_{Cargo^*}$, the orientation of the selected cargo gene ($1$ for forward, $-1$ for reverse).\n- $\\ell = i_{IS_L^*}$, the start index of the left $IS$ element.\n- $r = i_{IS_R^*}$, the start index of the right $IS$ element.\n\nIf no valid triplet can be formed for any cargo (for instance, if no cargo elements are found, or if no cargo is flanked by at least one $IS$ on each side), no transposon is detected. In this case, the output is $[0, 0, 0, -1, -1]$.
