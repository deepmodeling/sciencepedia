A sample of a transformant mixture was processed such that the following totals were recovered and back-calculated from appropriate dilutions and plated volumes: total viable recipients recovered equals $1.8 \\times 10^{8}$ CFU, total transformants recovered equals $3.6 \\times 10^{4}$ CFU.

The givens are: a set of $10$ replicate pairs of colony counts from non-selective plates ($N_i$) and selective plates ($S_i$), a dilution factor of $10^{-4}$, a plated volume of $0.10$ mL, and a specified statistical model where the number of transformants $S_i$ conditional on the number of viable cells $N_i$ follows a binomial distribution, $S_i|N_i \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N_i, p)$. The data are $N_i \\in \\{180, 140, 160, 155, 190, 170, 180, 185, 70, 70\\}$ and $S_i \\in \\{2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1\\}$. The problem is scientifically grounded, as it describes a standard experimental protocol in microbiology for determining transformation frequency. It is mathematically well-posed, providing sufficient information and a clear objective. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe primary objective is to estimate the transformation frequency, denoted by the parameter $p$. The problem states that for each of the $k=10$ replicate pairs, the number of transformed colonies, $S_i$, conditional on the number of viable colonies, $N_i$, follows a binomial distribution with parameters $N_i$ and $p$. The probability mass function for a single replicate pair is:\n$$P(S_i=s_i | N_i=n_i, p) = \\binom{n_i}{s_i} p^{s_i} (1-p)^{n_i - s_i}$$\nSince the replicate pairs are independent, the total likelihood function $L(p)$ for the parameter $p$, given the full dataset $\\{ (S_i, N_i) \\}_{i=1}^{10}$, is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$L(p; \\{S_i, N_i\\}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{10} \\binom{N_i}{S_i} p^{S_i} (1-p)^{N_i - S_i}$$\nThis expression can be simplified by collecting terms involving $p$:\n$$L(p) = \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{10} \\binom{N_i}{S_i} \\right) p^{\\sum_{i=1}^{10} S_i} (1-p)^{\\sum_{i=1}^{10} (N_i - S_i)}$$\nLet $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{10} S_i$ be the total number of transformants and $N = \\sum_{i=1}^{10} N_i$ be the total number of viable cells. The likelihood function becomes:\n$$L(p) \\propto p^S (1-p)^{N-S}$$\nThis is the kernel of a binomial distribution for $S$ successes in $N$ total trials. Thus, the problem is equivalent to analyzing a single pooled experiment. First, we calculate the total counts from the data provided:\n$$N = 180 + 140 + 160 + 155 + 190 + 170 + 180 + 185 + 70 + 70 = 1500$$\n$$S = 2 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 12$$\nTo derive an estimator for $p$, we use the principle of maximum likelihood. It is more convenient to maximize the log-likelihood function, $\\ell(p) = \\ln L(p)$:\n$$\\ell(p) = \\text{const} + S \\ln(p) + (N-S) \\ln(1-p)$$\nTo find the maximum, we compute the first derivative with respect to $p$ and set it to zero:\n$$\\frac{d\\ell}{dp} = \\frac{S}{p} - \\frac{N-S}{1-p} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{S}{p} = \\frac{N-S}{1-p} \\implies S(1-p) = p(N-S) \\implies S = Np$$\nThe maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for $p$, denoted $\\hat{p}$, is therefore:\n$$\\hat{p} = \\frac{S}{N}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values, we obtain the point estimate for the transformation frequency:\n$$\\hat{p} = \\frac{12}{1500} = \\frac{1}{125} = 0.008$$\n\nNext, we construct an approximate two-sided $95\\%$ confidence interval for $p$. The problem specifies using the asymptotic normal approximation justified by the Fisher information. The MLE $\\hat{p}$ is asymptotically normally distributed with mean $p$ and variance equal to the inverse of the Fisher information, $I(p)^{-1}$. The Fisher information for a binomial experiment with $N$ trials is given by:\n$$I(p) = -E\\left[\\frac{d^2\\ell}{dp^2}\\right]$$\nThe second derivative of the log-likelihood is:\n$$\\frac{d^2\\ell}{dp^2} = -\\frac{S}{p^2} - \\frac{N-S}{(1-p)^2}$$\nTaking the negative expectation, noting that $E[S] = Np$:\n$$I(p) = -E\\left[-\\frac{S}{p^2} - \\frac{N-S}{(1-p)^2}\\right] = \\frac{E[S]}{p^2} + \\frac{N-E[S]}{(1-p)^2} = \\frac{Np}{p^2} + \\frac{N-Np}{(1-p)^2} = \\frac{N}{p} + \\frac{N}{1-p} = \\frac{N}{p(1-p)}$$\nThe asymptotic variance of $\\hat{p}$ is thus $\\text{Var}(\\hat{p}) \\approx [I(p)]^{-1} = \\frac{p(1-p)}{N}$. In practice, we do not know $p$, so we estimate the standard error ($SE$) by substituting $\\hat{p}$ for $p$:\n$$SE(\\hat{p}) \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{N}}$$\nA $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval for $p$ is then constructed as $\\hat{p} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2} \\cdot SE(\\hat{p})$. For a $95\\%$ confidence interval, $\\alpha = 0.05$ and the critical value from the standard normal distribution is $z_{\\alpha/2} = z_{0.025} \\approx 1.96$.\n\nThe use of the normal approximation is justified as the sample size is large. A common rule of thumb is that both $N\\hat{p}$ and $N(1-\\hat{p})$ should be greater than or equal to $10$. Here, $N\\hat{p} = S = 12$ and $N(1-\\hat{p}) = 1500 - 12 = 1488$.

Multiplying the equation by the integrating factor gives:\n$$ e^{k_{sum}t}\\frac{dS}{dt} + k_{sum}e^{k_{sum}t}S = k_b S_{\\max} e^{k_{sum}t} $$\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(S(t)e^{k_{sum}t}\\right) = k_b S_{\\max} e^{k_{sum}t} $$\nIntegrating with respect to time $t$:\n$$ S(t)e^{k_{sum}t} = \\int k_b S_{\\max} e^{k_{sum}t} dt = \\frac{k_b S_{\\max}}{k_{sum}} e^{k_{sum}t} + C $$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. The general solution for $S(t)$ is:\n$$ S(t) = \\frac{k_b S_{\\max}}{k_{sum}} + Ce^{-k_{sum}t} $$\nUsing the initial condition $S(0) = 0$:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{k_b S_{\\max}}{k_{sum}} + C \\implies C = -\\frac{k_b S_{\\max}}{k_{sum}} $$\nThus, the particular solution for $S(t)$ is:\n$$ S(t) = \\frac{k_b S_{\\max}}{k_b + k_t} \\left(1 - e^{-(k_b+k_t)t}\\right) $$\nNext, we solve for the internalized DNA, $I(t)$. The governing equation is:\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dt} = k_t S(t) = k_t \\left( \\frac{k_b S_{\\max}}{k_b+k_t} \\left(1 - e^{-(k_b+k_t)t}\\right) \\right) $$\nWe integrate this equation from $\\tau=0$ to $\\tau=t$, using the initial condition $I(0)=0$:\n$$ I(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{dI}{d\\tau} d\\tau = \\frac{k_t k_b S_{\\max}}{k_b+k_t} \\int_{0}^{t} \\left(1 - e^{-(k_b+k_t)\\tau}\\right) d\\tau $$\nEvaluating the integral:\n$$ I(t) = \\frac{k_t k_b S_{\\max}}{k_b+k_t} \\left[ \\tau + \\frac{1}{k_b+k_t}e^{-(k_b+k_t)\\tau} \\right]_{0}^{t} $$\n$$ I(t) = \\frac{k_t k_b S_{\\max}}{k_b+k_t} \\left( \\left(t + \\frac{e^{-(k_b+k_t)t}}{k_b+k_t}\\right) - \\left(0 + \\frac{e^{0}}{k_b+k_t}\\right) \\right) $$\nThis simplifies to the final analytical solution for $I(t)$:\n$$ I(t) = \\frac{k_t k_b S_{\\max}}{k_b+k_t} \\left( t + \\frac{e^{-(k_b+k_t)t} - 1}{k_b+k_t} \\right) $$\nThese two functions, $S(t)$ and $I(t)$, constitute the forward model for our fitting procedure.\n\nThe parameter estimation is performed by minimizing the weighted sum of squared residuals (the chi-squared statistic, $\\chi^2$) between the model predictions and the synthetic data. The objective function to minimize with respect to the parameters $p = (k_b, k_t, S_{\\max})$ is:\n$$ \\chi^2(p) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\tilde{S}(t_i) - S(t_i; p)}{\\sigma_S}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\tilde{I}(t_i) - I(t_i; p)}{\\sigma_I}\\right)^2 \\right] $$\nwhere $\\{\\tilde{S}(t_i)\\}_{i=1}^N$ and $\\{\\tilde{I}(t_i)\\}_{i=1}^N$ are the synthetic data points at time points $\\{t_i\\}_{i=1}^N$, and $\\sigma_S = \\sigma_I = 3.0$ are the known standard deviations of the noise. The minimization is performed subject to the constraints $k_b>0$, $k_t>0$, and $S_{\\max}>0$.\n\nFor each test case, the following procedure is executed:\n1.  Synthetic data for $\\tilde{S}(t_i)$ and $\\tilde{I}(t_i)$ are generated by evaluating the analytical solutions $S(t; p_{\\text{true}})$ and $I(t; p_{\\text{true}})$ at the specified time points, adding Gaussian noise with mean $0$ and standard deviation $3.0$, and clipping any resulting negative values to $0$. A fixed random seed of $7$ ensures reproducibility.\n2.  The `scipy.optimize.least_squares` function is used to find the parameter values $(\\hat{k}_b, \\hat{k}_t, \\hat{S}_{\\max})$ that minimize the $\\chi^2$ function. The function is supplied with a vector of weighted residuals, the components of which are $(\\tilde{S}(t_i) - S(t_i; p))/\\sigma_S$ and $(\\tilde{I}(t_i) - I(t_i; p))/\\sigma_I$.\n3.  Strict positivity constraints are enforced by providing lower bounds of a small positive value (e.g., $10^{-9}$) to the optimizer.\n4.  The optimized values for $k_b$ and $k_t$ are collected and formatted as required.\n\nThis structured approach, founded on the analytical solution of the governing ODEs and standard principles of nonlinear regression, allows for a robust and accurate estimation of the required kinetic parameters.", "answer": "[0.4996,0.1983,1.0068,0.0503,0.0991,0.8037,0.0298,0.0202]", "id": "2514479"}]}
