The solution process may proceed.\n\n**Derivation of the Error Rate Expression**\n\nThe task is to find the final, residual per-site replication error rate, $E$. This represents the probability that a misincorporation occurs at a given site and is not corrected by either the proofreading mechanism or the mismatch repair system. We can model this as a sequence of probabilistic events.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $M$: A misincorporation occurs at a site. The probability of this event is given as $P(M) = p$.\n- $C_{\\text{proof}}$: The misincorporation is corrected by proofreading.\n- $C_{\\text{MMR}}$: The misincorporation is corrected by MMR.\n\nThe problem provides conditional probabilities based on these events:\n- The proofreading efficiency is $\\epsilon_{\\text{proof}} = P(C_{\\text{proof}} | M)$.\n- The MMR efficiency is $\\epsilon_{\\text{MMR}} = P(C_{\\text{MMR}} | M \\cap C_{\\text{proof}}^c)$, where $C_{\\text{proof}}^c$ is the complement of $C_{\\text{proof}}$, meaning the error was *not* corrected by proofreading (it escaped).\n\nA final error persists if a misincorporation occurs ($M$), it is not corrected by proofreading ($C_{\\text{proof}}^c$), and it is not corrected by MMR ($C_{\\text{MMR}}^c$). We are therefore looking for the probability of the intersection of these three events:\n$$E = P(M \\cap C_{\\text{proof}}^c \\cap C_{\\text{MMR}}^c)$$\n\nWe use the chain rule of probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, to decompose this expression.\n$$E = P(C_{\\text{MMR}}^c | M \\cap C_{\\text{proof}}^c) \\times P(M \\cap C_{\\text{proof}}^c)$$\nFurther decomposing the second term:\n$$P(M \\cap C_{\\text{proof}}^c) = P(C_{\\text{proof}}^c | M) \\times P(M)$$\nSubstituting this back, we obtain the full expression for $E$:\n$$E = P(M) \\times P(C_{\\text{proof}}^c | M) \\times P(C_{\\text{MMR}}^c | M \\cap C_{\\text{proof}}^c)$$\n\nNow, we relate this expression to the given parameters:\n1.  The probability of an initial misincorporation is $P(M) = p$.\n2.  The probability that proofreading fails, given a misincorporation has occurred, is the complement of the proofreading efficiency:\n    $$P(C_{\\text{proof}}^c | M) = 1 - P(C_{\\text{proof}} | M) = 1 - \\epsilon_{\\text{proof}}$$\n3.  The probability that MMR fails, given that an error has escaped proofreading, is the complement of the MMR efficiency:\n    $$P(C_{\\text{MMR}}^c | M \\cap C_{\\text{proof}}^c) = 1 - P(C_{\\text{MMR}} | M \\cap C_{\\text{proof}}^c) = 1 - \\epsilon_{\\text{MMR}}$$\n\nSubstituting these into our expression for $E$ yields the analytical solution:\n$$E = p \\times (1 - \\epsilon_{\\text{proof}}) \\times (1 - \\epsilon_{\\text{MMR}})$$\nThis formula represents the logical cascade: the final error rate is the initial error rate attenuated by two sequential, independent filtering steps.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are given the following values to substitute into the derived expression:\n- $p = 10^{-5}$\n- $\\epsilon_{\\text{proof}} = 0.99$\n- $\\epsilon_{\\text{MMR}} = 0.99$\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$E = (10^{-5}) \\times (1 - 0.99) \\times (1 - 0.99)$$\n$$E = 10^{-5} \\times 0.01 \\times 0.01$$\nExpressing the decimal fractions as powers of $10$:\n$$E = 10^{-5} \\times 10^{-2} \\times 10^{-2}$$\nUsing the property of exponents $a^m \\times a^n = a^{m+n}$:\n$$E = 10^{-5 - 2 - 2} = 10^{-9}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in scientific notation and rounded to two significant figures.

This practice connects the fundamental principles of enzyme kinetics and protein conformational change to the dynamic operation of a critical DNA repair pathway.", "problem": "Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)-dependent DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in bacteria proceeds from the following experimentally established base: Escherichia coli MutS recognizes a base–base mismatch in an Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP)-bound conformation and, upon binding ATP, undergoes a conformational change into a mobile sliding clamp that leaves the mismatch site and diffuses along duplex DNA, recruiting MutL and activating MutH at a hemimethylated GATC site to incise the nascent strand. ATP hydrolysis by MutS resets the protein to an ADP-bound mismatch-recognition state, enabling turnover. In contrast, Base Excision Repair (BER) initiates via lesion-specific glycosylases and Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) via UvrA–UvrB lesion recognition; neither substitutes for MMR recognition of a canonical base–base mismatch in an in vitro MMR-reconstituted assay.\n\nYou perform two parallel in vitro single-molecule MMR assays on identical heteroduplex DNA containing a single G/T mismatch and a hemimethylated GATC site at a defined distance. Both reactions contain MutL, MutH, UvrD helicase, single-stranded DNA binding protein, and replication proteins sufficient for excision and resynthesis, with ATP present at saturating concentration and MutS present at a limiting concentration relative to DNA molecules. In one reaction you replace wild-type MutS with a Walker A mutant MutS-K42A that cannot bind ATP; in the other reaction you replace wild-type MutS with a Walker B mutant MutS-E607Q that binds ATP but cannot hydrolyze it. You measure, relative to wild type under the same conditions, the following qualitative readouts: (i) mismatch-site dwell time of MutS, (ii) frequency and lifetime of MutS sliding clamps, (iii) MutL recruitment and MutH-dependent incision at the hemimethylated site, and (iv) overall mismatch correction yield after allowing sufficient time for excision and resynthesis.\n\nWhich option best predicts the qualitative changes you should observe, relative to wild type, for both mutants under these conditions?\n\nA. MutS-K42A: increased mismatch-site dwell, essentially no sliding clamp formation, strongly reduced MutL recruitment and MutH incision, and low overall mismatch correction yield. MutS-E607Q: decreased mismatch-site dwell due to rapid conversion into sliding clamps, increased frequency and lifetime of sliding clamps, detectable MutL recruitment with near-normal early incision, but reduced overall mismatch correction yield because MutS cannot reset and is sequestered on long-lived clamps under limiting MutS conditions.\n\nB.

The roles of MutS, MutL, MutH, $ATP$ binding, and $ATP$ hydrolysis are well-established. Walker A and Walker B motifs are conserved elements in $ATP$ase enzymes, and the described mutations ($K \\rightarrow A$ to prevent nucleotide binding and $E \\rightarrow Q$ to prevent hydrolysis) are standard tools used to dissect such pathways. The experimental setup is a classic *in vitro* reconstitution assay. The problem is fundamentally sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem defines the initial state, the specific perturbations (mutants), and the expected outputs. The mechanism is described with sufficient detail to allow for logical deduction of the consequences of each mutation. A unique set of predictions can be derived.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, technical language, free from subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically valid, well-posed, and objective. It contains no contradictions or missing information critical to its resolution. Therefore, a derivation of the solution is warranted.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe analysis will proceed by first establishing the wild-type ($WT$) baseline and then systematically evaluating the consequences of each mutation based on the provided mechanism.\n\n**Wild-Type ($WT$) MutS Pathway (Baseline):**\n1.  **Mismatch Recognition:** $ADP$-MutS binds the $G/T$ mismatch.\n2.  **Clamp Loading:** At saturating $ATP$ concentration, $ATP$ binds to MutS, triggering a conformational change. This causes MutS to release the mismatch and form a sliding clamp on the DNA. This step limits the mismatch-site dwell time.\n3.  **Downstream Signaling:** The $ATP$-MutS clamp diffuses, recruits MutL, and activates MutH for incision.\n4.  **Turnover:** MutS eventually hydrolyzes its bound $ATP$, converting back to the $ADP$-bound form, which dissociates from the DNA. This reset step is crucial for catalytic turnover, allowing a single MutS protein to initiate repair on multiple DNA molecules. Given that MutS is limiting, this catalytic capability is essential for achieving a high overall repair yield.\n\n**Analysis of the MutS-K42A Mutant (Cannot Bind $ATP$):**\n- **(i) Mismatch-site dwell time:** The problem states that MutS recognizes the mismatch in its $ADP$-bound form. The transition away from the mismatch requires $ATP$ binding. As MutS-K42A cannot bind $ATP$, it will bind to the mismatch site and become trapped. Therefore, its dwell time at the mismatch will be significantly **increased** compared to $WT$.\n- **(ii) Sliding clamp formation:** Formation of the sliding clamp is strictly dependent on the $ATP$-bound state. Since MutS-K42A cannot bind $ATP$, it cannot undergo the conformational change to form a sliding clamp. The frequency of clamp formation will be **zero or near-zero**.\n- **(iii) MutL recruitment and incision:** MutL is recruited by the MutS sliding clamp. In the absence of clamp formation, MutL recruitment is abrogated. Consequently, MutH is not activated, and incision does not occur. These processes will be **strongly reduced or abolished**.\n- **(iv) Overall correction yield:** Since the pathway is blocked at the very first step after mismatch recognition, no repair can take place. The overall yield will be **very low or zero**.\n\n**Analysis of the MutS-E607Q Mutant (Binds $ATP$, Cannot Hydrolyze $ATP$):**\n- **(i) Mismatch-site dwell time:** MutS-E607Q binds the mismatch as an $ADP$-bound protein and then binds $ATP$. The $ATP$ binding event, which is efficient at saturating concentrations, triggers release from the mismatch and clamp formation. Because this transition is now essentially irreversible (due to the inability to hydrolyze $ATP$), the protein will rapidly commit to the clamp state. The mismatch-site dwell time is therefore expected to be **decreased** relative to $WT$.\n- **(ii) Sliding clamp formation and lifetime:** The transition to the clamp state is efficient. In the $WT$ protein, $ATP$ hydrolysis limits the lifetime of the clamp. The MutS-E607Q mutant is locked in the $ATP$-bound state, meaning once it forms a sliding clamp, it is a terminal, highly stable state. The lifetime of these clamps will thus be **greatly increased**, and they will accumulate on the DNA.\n- **(iii) MutL recruitment and incision:** The stable $ATP$-MutS-E607Q clamp is the active species for recruiting MutL. This complex will form and proceed to activate MutH for incision. The stability of the signaling complex might even lead to highly efficient incision for any given active complex. Thus, MutL recruitment and MutH-dependent incision will be **detectable and occur with near-normal kinetics for the initial phase** of the reaction.\n- **(iv) Overall correction yield:** This is where the limiting concentration of MutS is critical. Each MutS-E607Q protein can perform only one round of mismatch recognition and initiation. After forming the permanent clamp, it is sequestered on that one DNA molecule and cannot be recycled to repair others. The reaction becomes stoichiometric ($1$ MutS per $1$ repair event) rather than catalytic. In contrast, $WT$ MutS can cycle multiple times. Therefore, over a sufficient period, the overall yield of corrected DNA molecules will be **significantly reduced** compared to the $WT$ reaction.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n- **A.** Predicts for MutS-K42A: increased mismatch-site dwell, no sliding clamps, reduced incision, and low yield. Predicts for MutS-E607Q: decreased mismatch-site dwell, long-lived clamps, detectable incision, but reduced overall yield due to sequestration under limiting MutS. This set of predictions perfectly aligns with the derivation above.\n  - **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n- **B.** Predicts for MutS-K42A: \"decreased mismatch binding because $ATP$ hydrolysis is disabled\". This is incorrect on two counts. First, MutS-K42A is an $ATP$-binding mutant, not a hydrolysis mutant. Second, recognition occurs in the $ADP$ state, so binding should not be decreased. Predicts for MutS-E607Q: \"trapped at the mismatch without clamp formation\". This is incorrect; $ATP$ binding should promote release from the mismatch and clamp formation.\n  - **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n- **C.** Predicts for MutS-K42A: \"normal clamp formation\". This is incorrect. Clamp formation requires $ATP$ binding, which this mutant lacks. Predicts for MutS-E607Q: \"reliance on Base Excision Repair\". This contradicts the problem statement that BER cannot substitute for MMR in this context.\n  - **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n- **D.** Predicts for MutS-K42A: \"slow but eventual clamp formation\". This is impossible if the protein cannot bind $ATP$. Predicts for MutS-E607Q: \"increased mismatch-site dwell without clamp formation\". This is the opposite of the expected behavior; dwell time should decrease and clamps should form readily.\n  - **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n- **E.** Predicts for MutS-K42A correctly. However, it predicts for MutS-E607Q: \"full wild-type repair yield even when MutS is limiting\". This is fundamentally incorrect. The inability of MutS-E607Q to hydrolyze $ATP$ prevents its catalytic turnover, which is essential for achieving a high yield when the enzyme is limiting. The yield must be reduced compared to $WT$.\n  - **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2513514"}, {"introduction": "Beyond replication errors, cells must constantly combat chemical damage, such as the oxidation of guanine to $8$-oxoguanine.

Base excision repair relies on DNA glycosylases to remove specific aberrant bases, creating an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site subsequently processed by an AP endonuclease, a repair polymerase, and a ligase to restore the correct base pair. Consider the fidelity of replication and mutational fixation in the following general scenario: an $8$-oxoG lesion resides on a parental strand at a position that is normally a G:C pair. During replication, a DNA polymerase may insert either cytosine or adenine opposite $8$-oxoG.

Loss of MUTYH increases G:C to T:A transversions because A:$8$-oxoG mispairs persist into the next replication cycle; loss of OGG$1$ increases G:C to T:A transversions by allowing $8$-oxoG to accumulate and template A, with the magnitude mitigated if MUTYH remains functional.\n\nB.

Therefore, I will proceed with a full derivation of the solution and evaluation of the options.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe problem concerns the repair of oxidative DNA damage, specifically the lesion $8$-oxoguanine ($8$-oxoG). We must analyze the sequence of events starting from the formation of this lesion within a $G:C$ base pair.\n\n1.  **Initial State**: Oxidation of guanine ($G$) on one strand of a $G:C$ pair results in an $8$-oxoG:C pair. This is the starting point.\n    $$ G:C \\xrightarrow{\\text{ROS}} 8\\text{-oxoG}:C $$\n\n2.  **Role of OGG1 (8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase)**: OGG$1$ is a DNA glycosylase that specifically recognizes and excises the $8$-oxoG base from the DNA backbone, particularly when it is paired with cytosine ($C$). This is a pre-replicative repair mechanism.\n    $$ 8\\text{-oxoG}:C \\xrightarrow{\\text{OGG1}} \\text{[AP site]}:C $$\n    The resulting AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) site is then processed by the rest of the BER machinery (AP endonuclease, DNA polymerase, DNA ligase) to insert a correct guanine ($G$), restoring the original $G:C$ pair.\n    $$ \\text{[AP site]}:C \\xrightarrow{\\text{BER}} G:C $$\n    **Consequence of OGG1 Loss**: If OGG$1$ is defective, the $8$-oxoG:C pair persists and will be present during DNA replication.\n\n3.  **First Round of Replication**: The $8$-oxoG lesion is on the template strand. Due to its ability to adopt a `syn` conformation, $8$-oxoG can mispair with adenine ($A$). DNA polymerase will therefore frequently misincorporate $A$ into the nascent strand opposite $8$-oxoG.\n    $$ \\text{Parental } 5'-...8\\text{-oxoG}...-3' \\xrightarrow{\\text{Replication}} \\text{Nascent } 3'-...A...-5' $$\n    This creates an $8$-oxoG:A mispair in one daughter duplex. The other parental strand containing $C$ will correctly template a $G$, yielding a normal $G:C$ duplex.\n\n4.  **Role of MUTYH (MutY homolog)**: The $8$-oxoG:A mispair is the specific substrate for the MUTYH DNA glycosylase. Importantly, MUTYH does not act on the damaged base ($8$-oxoG$). Instead, it excises the *unmodified but incorrect* adenine ($A$) from the newly synthesized strand. This is a post-replicative repair mechanism.\n    $$ 8\\text{-oxoG}:A \\xrightarrow{\\text{MUTYH}} 8\\text{-oxoG}:\\text{[AP site]} $$\n    The BER machinery then fills the gap opposite $8$-oxoG. DNA polymerase preferentially inserts a cytosine ($C$) opposite the lesion, recreating the $8$-oxoG:C pair. This gives OGG$1$ another chance to perform the primary repair.\n\n5.  **Second Round of Replication and Mutational Fixation**: Let us consider the scenario where the $8$-oxoG:A mispair is *not* repaired by MUTYH. This occurs if MUTYH is defective. When this duplex undergoes the next round of replication:\n    - The strand containing $8$-oxoG will again template the insertion of $A$, generating another $8$-oxoG:A mispair.\n    - The strand containing $A$ will serve as a template for the insertion of thymine ($T$).\n    $$ \\text{Parental } 5'-...A...-3' \\xrightarrow{\\text{Replication}} \\text{Nascent } 3'-...T...-5' $$\n    This creates a stable $A:T$ base pair where a $G:C$ pair originally existed. The mutation is now fixed. Tracing the change on one of the original strands: the $G$ became an $A$ in the first replication, which then templated a $T$ in the complementary strand. The original base pair was $G:C$. The final base pair is $T:A$. This transformation from a purine-pyrimidine pair ($G:C$) to a pyrimidine-purine pair ($T:A$) is a **transversion**. Specifically, it is a $G:C \\to T:A$ transversion.\n\n**Summary of Consequences of Enzyme Loss**:\n- **Loss of OGG1**: Increases the load of $8$-oxoG lesions entering replication, leading to a higher frequency of $8$-oxoG:A mispairs. If MUTYH is functional, it can correct many of these, but some may escape, leading to an increased rate of $G:C \\to T:A$ transversions.\n- **Loss of MUTYH**: Directly prevents the correction of $8$-oxoG:A mispairs. Any such mispairs that form will almost certainly persist to the next replication cycle, leading to a very high rate of $G:C \\to T:A$ transversions.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. MUTYH excises adenine misincorporated opposite $8$-oxoG (creating an AP site on the nascent strand), routing the site toward restoration of G:C after subsequent removal of $8$-oxoG; OGG$1$ excises $8$-oxoG when paired with cytosine (creating an AP site at the oxidized base on the template strand). Loss of MUTYH increases G:C to T:A transversions because A:$8$-oxoG mispairs persist into the next replication cycle; loss of OGG$1$ increases G:C to T:A transversions by allowing $8$-oxoG to accumulate and template A, with the magnitude mitigated if MUTYH remains functional.**\n- The description of MUTYH function is correct: it excises $A$ from an $A:8$-oxoG pair. The ultimate goal is restoration of $G:C$, which is a correct description of the pathway's purpose.\n- The description of OGG$1$ function is correct: it excises $8$-oxoG from an $8$-oxoG:C pair.\n- The mutational consequence of MUTYH loss, a $G:C \\to T:A$ transversion, is correct, and the reasoning is sound.\n- The mutational consequence of OGG$1$ loss, also a $G:C \\to T:A$ transversion, is correct, and the statement that a functional MUTYH mitigates this effect is also correct.\nAll parts of this statement are accurate.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. MUTYH excises $8$-oxoG from cytosine:$8$-oxoG pairs (creating an AP site on the damaged template), while OGG$1$ excises adenine from adenine:$8$-oxoG mispairs (creating an AP site on the nascent strand). Loss of MUTYH primarily causes G:C to C:G transversions, whereas loss of OGG$1$ primarily causes A:T to C:G transitions.**\n- This option incorrectly swaps the roles of MUTYH and OGG$1$. OGG$1$ excises $8$-oxoG, and MUTYH excises $A$.\n- The predicted mutation for MUTYH loss ($G:C \\to C:G$) is incorrect.\n- The predicted mutation for OGG$1$ loss ($A:T \\to C:G$) is incorrect; the lesion starts at a $G:C$ pair.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. MUTYH functions as a mismatch repair factor that recruits exonuclease to remove the nascent strand surrounding cytosine:$8$-oxoG, whereas OGG$1$ is specific to thymine glycol. Loss of MUTYH mainly yields small insertions and deletions at oxidized guanines, and loss of OGG$1$ mainly yields A:T to G:C transitions.**\n- MUTYH is a BER glycosylase, not a mismatch repair (MMR) factor. Its substrate is $A:8$-oxoG, not $C:8$-oxoG$.\n- OGG$1$'s primary substrate is $8$-oxoG, not thymine glycol (which is a substrate for other glycosylases like NTH$1$).\n- The mutational consequences described (indels, $A:T \\to G:C$ transitions) are incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. MUTYH excises guanine opposite thymine glycol, and OGG$1$ excises $8$-oxoG regardless of the opposing base. Loss of MUTYH leads to G:C to A:T transitions, while loss of OGG$1$ leads to G:C to C:G transversions.**\n- The substrate for MUTYH is incorrectly identified as guanine opposite thymine glycol.\n- The statement that OGG$1$ acts regardless of the opposing base is a gross oversimplification; its activity is much higher on $8$-oxoG:C than on $8$-oxoG:A$.\n- The mutation for MUTYH loss is classified as a transition ($G \\to A$), which is a purine-to-purine change. However, the resulting pair is $T:A$, deriving from an original $G:C$. The change is $G \\to T$ on one strand, which is a transversion. The terminology is incorrect.\n- The predicted mutation for OGG$1$ loss ($G:C \\to C:G$) is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, only option A provides a fully correct description of the enzymatic functions and their genetic consequences.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2513554"}]}
