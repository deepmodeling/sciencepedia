This first practice focuses on the crucial upstream step in *E. coli*: the processing of a double-strand break by the RecBCD enzyme complex. You will explore how RecBCD's dual helicase and nuclease activities are precisely modulated by specific DNA sequences known as Chi sites to generate the $3^{\\prime}$ single-stranded DNA tail that serves as the loading platform for the RecA filament. This exercise will sharpen your ability to translate a set of biological rules into a quantitative prediction, a core skill in molecular biology. [@problem_id:2500212]", "problem": "A linear double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecule of length $L = 24000$ base pairs is described on a one-dimensional coordinate $x \\in [0, L]$ with the left end at $x = 0$ and the right end at $x = L$. The top strand runs from $3^{\\prime}$ at $x=0$ to $5^{\\prime}$ at $x=L$, and the bottom strand runs from $5^{\\prime}$ at $x=0$ to $3^{\\prime}$ at $x=L$. A single RecBCD helicase-nuclease enzyme complex enters the duplex at the left blunt end ($x=0$) and translocates toward increasing $x$.\n\nUse the following foundational facts:\n- The crossover hotspot instigator (Chi) sequence is $5^{\\prime}$-GCTGGTGG-$3^{\\prime}$.\n- RecBCD recognizes Chi only when it is present in the correct orientation on the strand that presents a $3^{\\prime}$ terminus at the entry end. Here, that strand is the top strand at $x=0$.\n- Before encountering Chi, RecBCD unwinds and degrades both strands behind it. Upon encountering the first correctly oriented Chi on the $3^{\\prime}$-terminated strand, RecBCD attenuates degradation of that strand, makes a single-strand nick on that strand within the Chi region, and thereafter primarily degrades the complementary strand, generating a $3^{\\prime}$ single-stranded DNA overhang on the Chi-bearing strand that extends from the nick to the current translocation position. This $3^{\\prime}$ overhang is the preferred substrate for RecA (Recombinase A) loading.\n- For this DNA, the mapped Chi coordinates (reported as the coordinate of the left-most base of the Chi motif along the $x$ axis) are:\n  - Top strand: $x = 9708$ and $x = 18777$.\n  - Bottom strand: $x = 6123$ and $x = 15555$.\n- Upon Chi recognition, RecBCD nicks the $3^{\\prime}$-terminated top strand at a position $x_{\\text{nick}} = x_{\\chi} + \\delta$ with $\\delta = 4$ nucleotides, where $x_{\\chi}$ is the coordinate of the first base of the Chi motif as mapped above.\n- A roadblock halts RecBCD translocation at $x_{\\text{stop}} = 21231$.\n\nStarting from these facts and core definitions of strand polarity and RecBCD-Chi modulation, determine the length (in nucleotides) of the single-stranded DNA overhang on the top strand at the moment RecBCD is halted at $x_{\\text{stop}}$. Report your answer as an integer number of nucleotides; no rounding is required. Express the final length in nucleotides.", "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the length of a single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) overhang generated by the RecBCD enzyme complex. The solution is obtained by a systematic application of the provided biological rules and coordinates.\n\nFirst, we must identify which strand's Chi sites are relevant. The problem states that RecBCD enters at the left blunt end at $x=0$ and that it \"recognizes Chi only when it is present in the correct orientation on the strand that presents a $3^{\\prime}$ terminus at the entry end.\" The top strand is defined as having its $3^{\\prime}$ end at $x=0$. Therefore, RecBCD will scan and recognize Chi sites exclusively on the top strand. The Chi sites listed for the bottom strand, at $x = 6123$ and $x = 15555$, are consequently irrelevant to the modulation of RecBCD's nuclease activity in this scenario.\n\nSecond, we must identify the specific Chi site that alters RecBCD's function. The enzyme translocates from $x=0$ towards increasing $x$. The Chi sites on the top strand are located at coordinates $x = 9708$ and $x = 18777$. The problem specifies that the functional change occurs \"upon encountering the first correctly oriented Chi\". As the enzyme proceeds along the DNA, the first of these two sites it will encounter is the one with the smaller coordinate value. Thus, the operative Chi site, which we denote as $x_{\\chi}$, is:\n$$x_{\\chi} = 9708$$\n\nThird, we must calculate the exact position of the single-strand nick introduced by RecBCD. The problem provides a formula for the nick position, $x_{\\text{nick}}$, relative to the coordinate of the Chi site: $x_{\\text{nick}} = x_{\\chi} + \\delta$. We are given that the offset $\\delta = 4$ nucleotides. Substituting the values:\n$$x_{\\text{nick}} = 9708 + 4 = 9712$$\nThis nick is created on the top strand.\n\nFourth, we analyze the formation of the single-stranded overhang. Before encountering the Chi site at $x_{\\chi}=9708$, RecBCD degrades both DNA strands. After recognizing Chi and nicking the top strand at $x_{\\text{nick}}=9712$, RecBCD's activity changes: it primarily degrades the complementary (bottom) strand while leaving the top strand largely intact from the nick onwards. This process generates a $3^{\\prime}$ single-stranded overhang on the top strand. This overhang starts at the position of the nick, $x_{\\text{nick}}$, and extends to the current location of the RecBCD enzyme.\n\nFinally, we calculate the length of this overhang at the point where the enzyme's translocation is arrested. The enzyme is halted at a roadblock positioned at $x_{\\text{stop}} = 21231$. The single-stranded region on the top strand therefore spans the interval from $x_{\\text{nick}}$ to $x_{\\text{stop}}$. The length of this overhang, $\\Delta L_{\\text{overhang}}$, is the difference between these two coordinates.\n$$\\Delta L_{\\text{overhang}} = x_{\\text{stop}} - x_{\\text{nick}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated and given values:\n$$\\Delta L_{\\text{overhang}} = 21231 - 9712 = 11519$$\nThe length of the single-stranded DNA overhang on the top strand is $11519$ nucleotides.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{11519}$$", "id": "2500212"}, {"introduction": "Once a single-stranded DNA substrate is available, RecA monomers must assemble into a functional nucleoprotein filament.

According to the principle of mass action kinetics provided, the rates of association ($r_{\\text{on}}$) and dissociation ($r_{\\text{off}}$) at each end depend on the free monomer concentration, $c$, and the respective rate constants.\n\nThe net rate of change of filament length, measured in subunits per unit time, at the $+$ end is the difference between the association rate and the dissociation rate at that end. Let this net rate be $J^{+}$.\n$$J^{+} = r_{\\text{on}}^{+} - r_{\\text{off}}^{+} = k_{\\text{on}}^{+}c - k_{\\text{off}}^{+}$$\nSimilarly, the net rate of change at the $-$ end, $J^{-}$, is:\n$$J^{-} = r_{\\text{on}}^{-} - r_{\\text{off}}^{-} = k_{\\text{on}}^{-}c - k_{\\text{off}}^{-}$$\n\nThe total instantaneous net change in filament length, $J_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the net rates at both ends, assuming both ends are exposed and active.\n$$J_{\\text{total}}(c) = J^{+} + J^{-} = (k_{\\text{on}}^{+}c - k_{\\text{off}}^{+}) + (k_{\\text{on}}^{-}c - k_{\\text{off}}^{-})$$\nWe can group terms by their dependence on the concentration $c$:\n$$J_{\\text{total}}(c) = (k_{\\text{on}}^{+} + k_{\\text{on}}^{-})c - (k_{\\text{off}}^{+} + k_{\\text{off}}^{-})$$\nThe critical concentration, $c_{\\mathrm{c}}$, is defined as the specific concentration $c$ at which the net change in filament length is zero, i.e., $J_{\\text{total}}(c_{\\mathrm{c}}) = 0$.

A lower $c_{\\mathrm{c}}$ signifies that net polymerization can be achieved at a lower concentration of free monomers, thus favoring filament assembly. The RecFOR mediator complex influences the kinetics to promote assembly. It does so by:\n1.  Increasing the association rate constants ($k_{\\text{on}}^{+}$ and $k_{\\text{on}}^{-}$). This increases the denominator of the $c_{\\mathrm{c}}$ expression, thereby lowering its value. Mechanistically, this means that at any given monomer concentration, RecA monomers add to the filament ends more rapidly.\n2.  Decreasing the dissociation rate constants ($k_{\\text{off}}^{+}$ and $k_{\\text{off}}^{-}$). This decreases the numerator of the $c_{\\mathrm{c}}$ expression, which also lowers its value. Mechanistically, monomers that have bound to the filament ends are less likely to dissociate, making the filament more stable.\n\nBoth of these effects, accelerating monomer addition and decelerating monomer loss, act synergistically to lower the threshold concentration of free RecA required for net filament growth. The calculation confirms this, as the fold-change $f$ is less than $1$, indicating a significant drop in the critical concentration in the presence of RecFOR.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.492}$$", "id": "2500232"}, {"introduction": "RecA is a remarkable multifunctional protein, acting as both the core recombinase and a master regulator of the SOS DNA damage response.

You have an *Escherichia coli* strain with a deletion of the recA gene, and you can complement with plasmids expressing RecA variants. Use fundamental definitions: RecA binds single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (ssDNA) in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to form an active filament (commonly denoted RecA*) that catalyzes homologous pairing and strand exchange by capturing a double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA) partner. The same RecA* stimulates autocleavage of LexA, derepressing the SOS regulon, and promotes UmuD to UmuD′ processing that enables translesion synthesis. The dsDNA capture during strand exchange is mediated by a distinct secondary DNA-binding interface, often called site II, whereas ssDNA binding during filament formation is mediated by site I.\n\nYou must design an experiment that decouples the recombination function from the coprotease function and predict the resulting cellular phenotypes. The assays available are: a transcriptional SOS reporter (a PsulA-lacZ fusion for beta-galactosidase activity or a PrecA-green fluorescent protein reporter), a conjugational recombination or P1 transduction assay for homologous recombination frequency, an ultraviolet irradiation survival curve, an immunoblot detecting UmuD to UmuD′ processing, and microscopy to assess SulA-dependent filamentation.

Predictions: wild-type shows robust SOS induction after DNA damage (reporter increases by approximately $10$–$20$-fold), high homologous recombination frequency, efficient UmuD′ production, SulA-dependent filamentation after ultraviolet irradiation, and the highest survival. RecA-siteII shows strong SOS induction and UmuD′ production comparable to wild-type after damage (because RecA* still forms on ssDNA), but exhibits a markedly reduced recombination frequency and poor survival similar to the vector under recombinational stress; cells filament due to SOS induction. RecA-LexAint shows near wild-type recombination frequency and survival that is intermediate (benefiting from recombination but lacking inducible SOS), minimal SOS reporter induction and no UmuD′ production, and no SulA-dependent filamentation.

Complement with wild-type RecA and empty vector in cells carrying either a non-cleavable LexA allele (lexA Ind⁻) or a constitutively active LexA allele (lexA Ind⁺).

The definitions provided are precise and standard. The available assays are appropriate for measuring the predicted outcomes. The problem is objective and requires application of established principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-constructed question that tests fundamental understanding of molecular mechanisms. I will proceed to analyze the proposed options.\n\n**Analysis of Options**\n\nThe central premise for decoupling the functions is that the active RecA* filament (RecA-ssDNA-ATP) is the necessary intermediate for *both* recombination and coprotease activity. To separate the functions, a mutation must affect a step *downstream* of RecA* formation that is specific to one function but not the other.\n\n**Option A Evaluation**\n*   **Experimental Design:** This option proposes a set of four strains: `ΔrecA` complemented with empty vector (negative control), wild-type `recA` (positive control), `recA-siteII` (mutant defective in dsDNA capture), and `recA-LexAint` (mutant defective in protein-protein interaction with LexA/UmuD). This is an excellent design. The two mutant forms are archetypal separation-of-function alleles.\n    *   The `recA-siteII` mutant is designed to be **recombination-deficient but coprotease-proficient**. It should form a normal RecA* filament but fail to engage the dsDNA partner for strand exchange.\n    *   The `recA-LexAint` mutant is designed to be **recombination-proficient but coprotease-deficient**. It should execute strand exchange but fail to stimulate cleavage of LexA and UmuD.\n*   **Prediction Analysis:**\n    *   **Wild-type `RecA`:** Predictions are correct. It is the baseline for full activity in all assays. The predicted $10$–$20$-fold SOS induction is a realistic value.\n    *   **`RecA-siteII`:** The prediction is that it shows strong SOS induction and UmuD′ processing but has very low recombination frequency. This is mechanistically correct. Formation of the RecA* filament on ssDNA from UV damage is sufficient for coprotease activity. The lack of dsDNA capture (site II function) specifically abrogates recombination. The resulting phenotype of poor survival is also correct, as homologous recombination is a major DNA repair pathway. SulA-dependent filamentation is a direct, correct consequence of SOS induction.\n    *   **`RecA-LexAint`:** The prediction is that it shows near wild-type recombination frequency but minimal SOS induction and no UmuD′ production. This is also mechanistically correct. The core strand exchange machinery is intact, allowing for recombination. The specific defect in the coprotease interface prevents SOS induction. The resulting \"intermediate\" survival is a logical consequence: the cell benefits from recombination repair but lacks the benefits of the full SOS response (e.g., translesion synthesis via UmuD'). The absence of SOS induction correctly predicts no SulA-dependent filamentation.\n    *   **Empty vector:** Predictions are correct. The `ΔrecA` null strain is deficient in all RecA-dependent activities.\n*   **Verdict for A:** This option proposes a sound experimental design with mechanistically correct and consistent predictions. It successfully decouples the two functions using specific alleles. **Correct**.\n\n**Option B Evaluation**\n*   **Experimental Design:** Proposes using an ATPase-dead Walker A mutant (`RecA-ATP0`) and a C-terminal truncation (`RecA-ΔC`).\n*   **Prediction Analysis:** The prediction for `RecA-ATP0` is that it \"supports normal LexA and UmuD cleavage because ssDNA binding is sufficient\". This is fundamentally **incorrect**. The binding of ATP to RecA monomers is an absolute requirement for the conformational change that allows stable polymerization on ssDNA to form the active RecA* filament. A mutant that cannot bind ATP (`RecA-ATP0`) is catalytically dead for *both* recombination and coprotease activity. The premise is flawed.\n*   **Verdict for B:** This option is based on a critical scientific error regarding the role of ATP binding. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C Evaluation**\n*   **Experimental Design:** This manipulates the host genetic background (`lexA` alleles) rather than using `recA` variants to probe RecA function. This does not address the core task of designing an experiment to decouple the *functions of the RecA protein itself*.\n*   **Prediction Analysis:** The prediction for the `lexA Ind⁺` background that \"recombination is elevated independent of RecA filament status\" is **incorrect**. Homologous recombination is absolutely dependent on the formation of an active RecA filament to perform strand search and exchange. The status of the SOS system does not bypass this requirement.\n*   **Verdict for C:** The experimental design deviates from the stated goal, and it includes a fundamentally incorrect prediction. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D Evaluation**\n*   **Experimental Design:** Proposes a site I weak-binding mutant (`RecA-siteIweak`) and a mutant that impairs interaction with single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) (`RecA-SSBint`).\n*   **Prediction Analysis:**\n    *   The prediction for `RecA-siteIweak` is that it \"retains coprotease function because RecA can assemble on dsDNA instead\". This is **incorrect**. The active state for coprotease function is the ssDNA-bound filament. RecA binding to dsDNA does not produce this active conformation and does not trigger SOS induction. A defect in site I (ssDNA binding) would compromise the formation of the RecA* filament and thus impair *both* recombination and coprotease activity.\n    *   The prediction for `RecA-SSBint` is that it is \"coprotease-deficient because SSB displacement is only needed for recombination\". This is also **incorrect**. In vivo, ssDNA gaps and tails are coated by SSB. RecA must displace SSB to form a filament. This process is necessary to generate the RecA* filament, which is required for both recombination and coprotease activity. Therefore, a defect in the RecA-SSB interaction would negatively affect both functions.\n*   **Verdict for D:** This option contains multiple predictions based on flawed molecular reasoning. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOption A provides the only correct and complete answer. It proposes an elegant experimental design using precise separation-of-function mutants and accurately predicts the outcomes for all assays based on established molecular principles. The chosen mutants (`RecA-siteII` and `RecA-LexAint`) correctly isolate and separate the two key downstream activities of the RecA* filament.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2500183"}]}
