This exercise immerses you in the biophysical basics of how the LexA repressor silences genes in the absence of DNA damage.

Consider a promoter with a single SOS box site. LexA binds DNA as a pre-formed dimer. Let the free concentration of LexA dimer be denoted by $L$, and the dissociation constant for dimer binding to the SOS box be denoted by $K_d$, defined by the equilibrium relation $K_d = \\frac{[D][L]}{[DL]}$, where $[D]$ is the concentration of unbound promoter and $[DL]$ is the concentration of promoter bound by the LexA dimer.

In other words, transcription occurs only from the unbound state, and the intrinsic transcriptional capacity of the unbound promoter is unchanged by LexA.\n\nExpress both $f_{\\text{bound}}$ and $F$ as simplified analytic functions of $K_d$ and $L$. Report your final answer as dimensionless expressions. No numerical evaluation is required.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard equilibrium binding model for gene repression, a fundamental concept in molecular biophysics. All necessary assumptions and definitions are provided, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is valid. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system considers the reversible binding of a LexA dimer, $L$, to a single DNA operator site, the SOS box, denoted as $D$. The binding reaction is:\n$$D + L \\rightleftharpoons DL$$\nwhere $DL$ is the complex of the LexA dimer bound to the DNA.\n\nThe dissociation constant, $K_d$, is given by the law of mass action at equilibrium:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[D][L]}{[DL]}$$\nHere, $[D]$ is the concentration of free, unbound promoter sites, $[L]$ is the concentration of free LexA dimers, and $[DL]$ is the concentration of promoter sites bound by LexA. The problem states that $[L]$ can be treated as a constant, which we denote simply as $L$. Thus,\n$$K_d = \\frac{[D]L}{[DL]}$$\n\nThe first objective is to find the fractional occupancy, $f_{\\text{bound}}$. This is defined as the fraction of total promoter sites that are bound by the repressor at any given time.\n$$f_{\\text{bound}} = \\frac{\\text{Concentration of bound sites}}{\\text{Total concentration of sites}}$$\nLet the total concentration of promoter sites be $[D]_{\\text{total}}$. The total number of sites is the sum of the unbound sites and the bound sites:\n$$[D]_{\\text{total}} = [D] + [DL]$$\nTherefore, the fractional occupancy is:\n$$f_{\\text{bound}} = \\frac{[DL]}{[D] + [DL]}$$\nTo express this in terms of $L$ and $K_d$, we must eliminate the concentration terms $[D]$ and $[DL]$. We can do this by using the equilibrium relationship. From the definition of $K_d$, we can express $[D]$ in terms of $[DL]$:\n$$[D] = \\frac{K_d [DL]}{L}$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[D]$ into the equation for $f_{\\text{bound}}$:\n$$f_{\\text{bound}} = \\frac{[DL]}{\\left( \\frac{K_d [DL]}{L} \\right) + [DL]}$$\nThe term $[DL]$ appears in the numerator and in each term of the denominator, so it can be factored out and canceled:\n$$f_{\\text{bound}} = \\frac{[DL] \\cdot 1}{[DL] \\left( \\frac{K_d}{L} + 1 \\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{L} + 1}$$\nTo simplify this expression, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $L$:\n$$f_{\\text{bound}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d + L}{L}} = \\frac{L}{K_d + L}$$\nThis is the final expression for the fractional occupancy. It is a dimensionless quantity, as required.\n\nThe second objective is to derive the transcription fold-change, $F$. This is defined as the ratio of the basal transcription rate (in the presence of LexA) to the transcription rate in the fully unrepressed limit (no LexA).\n$$F = \\frac{R_{\\text{basal}}}{R_{\\text{unrepressed}}}$$\nThe problem states that transcription occurs *only* from the unbound state of the promoter. Therefore, the transcription rate must be proportional to the concentration of unbound promoters, $[D]$. Let $k_{txn}$ be the intrinsic rate constant of transcription from an unbound promoter.\n$$R_{\\text{basal}} = k_{txn} [D]$$\nIn the fully unrepressed limit, there is no LexA, so all promoter sites are unbound. The concentration of available promoters is the total concentration, $[D]_{\\text{total}}$. The maximum possible transcription rate is thus:\n$$R_{\\text{unrepressed}} = k_{txn} [D]_{\\text{total}}$$\nSubstituting these into the definition of $F$:\n$$F = \\frac{k_{txn} [D]}{k_{txn} [D]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[D]}{[D]_{\\text{total}}}$$\nThis ratio, $\\frac{[D]}{[D]_{\\text{total}}}$, is precisely the fraction of promoters that are *unbound*, which we can denote as $f_{\\text{unbound}}$.\n$$F = f_{\\text{unbound}}$$\nThe sum of the fraction of bound sites and the fraction of unbound sites must be equal to $1$:\n$$f_{\\text{bound}} + f_{\\text{unbound}} = 1$$\nTherefore, we can express $F$ in terms of the fractional occupancy $f_{\\text{bound}}$ which we have already derived:\n$$F = 1 - f_{\\text{bound}}$$\nSubstituting our expression for $f_{\\text{bound}}$:\n$$F = 1 - \\frac{L}{K_d + L}$$\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator:\n$$F = \\frac{K_d + L}{K_d + L} - \\frac{L}{K_d + L} = \\frac{(K_d + L) - L}{K_d + L}$$\n$$F = \\frac{K_d}{K_d + L}$$\nThis is the final expression for the fold-change.

For the DNA lesion burden, $D(t)$: The rate of change is the sum of a constant input $u$ and removal terms. Removal includes a basal rate proportional to $D$ (rate constant $k_b$) and a TLS-dependent rate proportional to both $T$ and $D$ (rate constant $k_T$).\n    $$ \\frac{dD}{dt} = u - k_b D - k_T T D = u - (k_b + k_T T) D $$\n2.  For activated RecA, $R^*(t)$: Formation is proportional to the amount of damage $D$ (proportionality constant $k_R$), and deactivation is a first-order process (rate constant $\\gamma_R$).\n    $$ \\frac{dR^*}{dt} = k_R D - \\gamma_R R^* $$\n3.  For the LexA repressor, $L(t)$: Synthesis is constitutive (constant rate $s_L$). Removal occurs through two pathways: $R^*$-stimulated autocleavage, modeled as a bimolecular reaction (rate constant $c$), and first-order dilution/degradation (rate constant $\\gamma_L$).\n    $$ \\frac{dL}{dt} = s_L - c R^* L - \\gamma_L L = s_L - (c R^* + \\gamma_L) L $$\n4.  For the TLS polymerase, $T(t)$: Synthesis is repressed by LexA. This is described by a maximal synthesis rate $s_T$ modulated by a Hill function of repression with $n=1$, which is $\\frac{K}{K+L}$.
