The two groups have apparent acid dissociation constants ($pK_a$) of $6.0$ and $9.0$, respectively. In a controlled experiment probing limits of pH homeostasis and microbial growth range, the cytosolic pH is clamped to the external pH values $5.5$, $7.0$, and $9.5$ (assume negligible intracellular buffering for the duration of the assay, so cytosolic pH equals external pH). Assume the following foundational facts:\n- The Hendersonâ€“Hasselbalch relationship connects the power of hydrogen (pH) to protonation state for a monoprotic acid: the fraction deprotonated of a weak acid with pK$_a$ equal to $pK_a$ at pH equal to $\\mathrm{pH}$ is $1/\\left(1+10^{pK_a-\\mathrm{pH}}\\right)$.\n- For a weak base with conjugate acid pK$_a$ equal to $pK_a$, the fraction protonated at pH equal to $\\mathrm{pH}$ is $1/\\left(1+10^{\\mathrm{pH}-pK_a}\\right)$.\n- The two ionizations are independent.\n\nLet the lower $pK_a$ group ($pK_a = 6.0$) be the group that must be deprotonated, and let the higher $pK_a$ group ($pK_a = 9.0$) be the group that must be protonated.

It describes a standard biophysical model for the pH dependence of enzyme activity. Therefore, a rigorous solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the relative activity of an enzyme and its computation at specific pH values. The enzyme's catalytic competence depends on the ionization state of two independent groups. Let $pK_{a1}$ be the acid dissociation constant for the first group, and $pK_{a2}$ for the second group. The given values are $pK_{a1} = 6.0$ and $pK_{a2} = 9.0$.\n\nFor catalytic activity, the group with $pK_{a1} = 6.0$ must be deprotonated, and the group with $pK_{a2} = 9.0$ must be protonated.\n\nLet $f_1(\\mathrm{pH})$ be the fraction of the first group that is deprotonated. The problem provides the formula derived from the Henderson-Hasselbalch relationship for a weak acid:\n$$f_1(\\mathrm{pH}) = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pK_{a1} - \\mathrm{pH}}}$$\n\nLet $f_2(\\mathrm{pH})$ be the fraction of the second group that is protonated. The problem provides the corresponding formula for a weak base's conjugate acid:\n$$f_2(\\mathrm{pH}) = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - pK_{a2}}}$$\n\nSince the two ionizations are independent events, the fraction of the total enzyme population that is in the catalytically competent state, denoted $F_{active}(\\mathrm{pH})$, is the product of the individual fractions:\n$$F_{active}(\\mathrm{pH}) = f_1(\\mathrm{pH}) \\cdot f_2(\\mathrm{pH}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pK_{a1} - \\mathrm{pH}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - pK_{a2}}}\\right)$$\n\nThe activity of the enzyme is proportional to $F_{active}(\\mathrm{pH})$. The relative activity, $A_{rel}(\\mathrm{pH})$, is defined as the fraction of active enzyme at a given pH divided by the maximum possible fraction, $F_{active, max}$. To find this maximum, we must find the pH at which $F_{active}(\\mathrm{pH})$ is maximized. This is achieved by taking the derivative of $F_{active}(\\mathrm{pH})$ with respect to $\\mathrm{pH}$ and setting it to zero. For convenience, we can differentiate the natural logarithm of $F_{active}(\\mathrm{pH})$:\n$$\\ln(F_{active}(\\mathrm{pH})) = -\\ln(1 + 10^{pK_{a1} - \\mathrm{pH}}) - \\ln(1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - pK_{a2}})$$\n$$\\frac{d}{d\\mathrm{pH}} \\ln(F_{active}(\\mathrm{pH})) = -\\frac{-10^{pK_{a1} - \\mathrm{pH}}\\ln(10)}{1 + 10^{pK_{a1} - \\mathrm{pH}}} - \\frac{10^{\\mathrm{pH} - pK_{a2}}\\ln(10)}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - pK_{a2}}}$$\nSetting the derivative to zero gives:\n$$\\frac{10^{pK_{a1} - \\mathrm{pH}}}{1 + 10^{pK_{a1} - \\mathrm{pH}}} = \\frac{10^{\\mathrm{pH} - pK_{a2}}}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - pK_{a2}}}$$\nThis equation is of the form $\\frac{x}{1+x} = \\frac{y}{1+y}$, which is satisfied if and only if $x=y$. Thus, at the optimal pH, denoted $\\mathrm{pH}_{opt}$:\n$$10^{pK_{a1} - \\mathrm{pH}_{opt}} = 10^{\\mathrm{pH}_{opt} - pK_{a2}}$$\nTaking the base-10 logarithm of both sides:\n$$pK_{a1} - \\mathrm{pH}_{opt} = \\mathrm{pH}_{opt} - pK_{a2}$$\n$$2 \\cdot \\mathrm{pH}_{opt} = pK_{a1} + pK_{a2}$$\n$$\\mathrm{pH}_{opt} = \\frac{pK_{a1} + pK_{a2}}{2}$$\n\nThe maximum fraction, $F_{active, max}$, is found by evaluating $F_{active}(\\mathrm{pH})$ at $\\mathrm{pH}_{opt}$.

Grouping the remaining terms gives:\n$$ \\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = RT(\\ln a_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\ln a_{\\mathrm{out}}) + F(\\psi_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\psi_{\\mathrm{out}}) $$\n$$ \\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = RT\\ln\\left(\\frac{a_{\\mathrm{in}}}{a_{\\mathrm{out}}}\\right) + F\\Delta\\psi $$\nWe are given that activities can be replaced by concentrations, $a=[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]$. The definition of pH is $\\mathrm{pH}=-\\log_{10}[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]$, which implies $[\\mathrm{H}^{+}] = 10^{-\\mathrm{pH}}$. The ratio of concentrations is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{in}}}{a_{\\mathrm{out}}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{in}}}{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{out}}} = \\frac{10^{-\\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{in}}}}{10^{-\\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{out}}}} = 10^{-(\\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{in}}-\\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{out}})} = 10^{-\\Delta\\mathrm{pH}} $$\nwhere $\\Delta\\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{in}}-\\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{out}}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$:\n$$ \\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = RT\\ln(10^{-\\Delta\\mathrm{pH}}) + F\\Delta\\psi $$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(x^y) = y\\ln x$:\n$$ \\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = -RT(\\ln 10)\\Delta\\mathrm{pH} + F\\Delta\\psi $$\nThe problem defines the proton motive force per proton, $\\Delta p$, such that $\\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = F \\Delta p$. Equating the two expressions for $\\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$:\n$$ F \\Delta p = F\\Delta\\psi - (RT\\ln 10)\\Delta\\mathrm{pH} $$\nDividing by the Faraday constant $F$ yields the final expression for $\\Delta p$:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\Delta\\psi - \\frac{RT\\ln 10}{F}\\Delta\\mathrm{pH} $$\nThis expression relates the total proton motive force to its two components: the electrical potential difference ($\\Delta\\psi$) and the chemical potential difference due to the pH gradient ($\\Delta\\mathrm{pH}$).\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $\\Delta p$. The given values are:\n$\\Delta\\psi = -140\\ \\mathrm{mV} = -0.140\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n$T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n$\\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{in}} = 6.5$\n$\\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{out}} = 4.5$\n$\\Delta\\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{out}} = 6.5 - 4.5 = 2.0$\n\nThe constants are $R \\approx 8.314\\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ and $F \\approx 96485\\ \\mathrm{C}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$. The term $\\ln 10 \\approx 2.303$.\nFirst, calculate the pre-factor $\\frac{RT\\ln 10}{F}$:\n$$ \\frac{RT\\ln 10}{F} \\approx \\frac{(8.314\\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1})(298\\ \\mathrm{K})(2.303)}{96485\\ \\mathrm{C}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}} \\approx 0.05916\\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{C}^{-1} = 0.05916\\ \\mathrm{V} $$\nThis is equivalent to $59.16\\ \\mathrm{mV}$.\n\nSubstitute the values into the equation for $\\Delta p$:\n$$ \\Delta p = -140\\ \\mathrm{mV} - (59.16\\ \\mathrm{mV})(2.0) $$\n$$ \\Delta p = -140\\ \\mathrm{mV} - 118.32\\ \\mathrm{mV} $$\n$$ \\Delta p = -258.32\\ \\mathrm{mV} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $\\Delta p \\approx -258\\ \\mathrm{mV}$.\n\nFinally, we assess the thermodynamic favorability of ATP synthesis. The free energy change for the inward flow of one mole of protons is a negative quantity, $\\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = F \\Delta p < 0$, because $\\Delta p$ is negative. This indicates that the inward movement of protons is a spontaneous, exergonic process. The enzyme ATP synthase couples this spontaneous proton influx to the non-spontaneous (endergonic) synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. Because the driving process (proton influx) is thermodynamically favorable and releases sufficient energy, it can drive the synthesis of ATP. Therefore, ATP synthesis is thermodynamically favorable under these conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-258}$$", "id": "2520009"}]}
