The standard unbiased counting-frame rule is used: two adjacent edges of the square are designated as inclusion edges, and the opposite two edges are designated as exclusion edges; a disk is counted if and only if it lies entirely within the frame or intersects an inclusion edge and does not intersect an exclusion edge.

It is based on standard principles of spatial statistics and quantitative microscopy, specifically the modeling of object distributions with a homogeneous Poisson point process. The definitions and parameters provided are clear and consistent, allowing for a rigorous mathematical derivation. The problem is declared valid.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in determining the effective sampling area under the specified incorrect counting rule. The number of objects counted in a region is a random variable, and for a homogeneous spatial Poisson point process, its expected value is the product of the process intensity, $\\lambda$, and the area of the region from which the objects' centers are sampled.\n\nLet the counting frame be a square in the $xy$-plane defined by $0 \\le x \\le L$ and $0 \\le y \\le L$. The total area of this frame is $A_{\\text{frame}} = L^2$. Microbial cells are modeled as circular disks of radius $r$. The centers of these disks are distributed according to a homogeneous Poisson point process with intensity $\\lambda$.\n\nThe density estimator is defined as $\\hat{\\lambda} = N/L^2$, where $N$ is the number of counted cells. The expected value of this estimator is $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\lambda}] = \\mathbb{E}[N]/L^2$.\n\nThe problem describes an incorrect counting practice, which we denote by the subscript \"ignore\". According to this rule, a disk is counted only if it is strictly fully contained within the square frame. For a circular disk of radius $r$ with center at $(x_c, y_c)$ to be fully contained within the square defined by $0 \\le x \\le L$ and $0 \\le y \\le L$, its center must satisfy the conditions:\n$$\nr \\le x_c \\le L-r\n$$\n$$\nr \\le y_c \\le L-r\n$$\nThese inequalities define a smaller, concentric square region within which the center of a counted disk must lie. The side length of this inner square is $(L-r) - r = L-2r$. This region represents the effective sampling area for the cell centers under the \"ignore\" rule. Let us denote this area as $A_{\\text{ignore}}$.\n$$\nA_{\\text{ignore}} = (L-2r)^{2}\n$$\nThe number of cells counted using this incorrect rule, $N_{\\text{ignore}}$, corresponds to the number of points of the Poisson process that fall within this effective area $A_{\\text{ignore}}$. The expected value of $N_{\\text{ignore}}$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N_{\\text{ignore}}] = \\lambda \\cdot A_{\\text{ignore}} = \\lambda(L-2r)^{2}\n$$\nThe expected value of the corresponding density estimator, $\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\text{ignore}}$, is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\text{ignore}}] = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[N_{\\text{ignore}}]}{L^2} = \\frac{\\lambda(L-2r)^{2}}{L^2}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the relative bias, $b$, defined as $b \\equiv \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\text{ignore}}]}{\\lambda} - 1$. Substituting the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\text{ignore}}]$:\n$$\nb = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda(L-2r)^{2}}{L^2} \\right) - 1\n$$\nThe intensity $\\lambda$ cancels out, yielding the general expression for the relative bias in terms of the geometric parameters $L$ and $r$:\n$$\nb = \\frac{(L-2r)^{2}}{L^2} - 1 = \\left( \\frac{L-2r}{L} \\right)^{2} - 1 = \\left( 1 - \\frac{2r}{L} \\right)^{2} - 1\n$$\nThis expression shows that the bias is negative, since $2r/L > 0$ (for non-zero cell size) and we assume $L > 2r$ for any counting to be possible. A negative bias signifies a systematic underestimation of the true density $\\lambda$, which is logical as the incorrect rule discards all cells that touch the boundary.\n\nNext, we specialize this result to the given numerical values.

The concentration of the original culture is $C$.\nAccording to the problem's premises, the count $N_i$ on plate $i$ is a random variable following a Poisson distribution with mean parameter $\\lambda_i = C D v_i$. The probability mass function is $P(N_i = n_i) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda_i)\\lambda_i^{n_i}}{n_i!}$.\nSince the counts on replicate plates are independent events, the likelihood function $L(C)$ for observing the set of counts $\\{n_1, \\dots, n_k\\}$ is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$ L(C; n_1, \\dots, n_k) = \\prod_{i=1}^{k} P(N_i = n_i) = \\prod_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{\\exp(-C D v_i) (C D v_i)^{n_i}}{n_i!} $$\nTo find the MLE, it is more convenient to maximize the log-likelihood function, $\\ell(C) = \\ln L(C)$:\n$$ \\ell(C) = \\ln \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{\\exp(-C D v_i) (C D v_i)^{n_i}}{n_i!} \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\ln \\left( \\frac{\\exp(-C D v_i) (C D v_i)^{n_i}}{n_i!} \\right) $$\n$$ \\ell(C) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\left( -C D v_i + n_i \\ln(C D v_i) - \\ln(n_i!) \\right) $$\n$$ \\ell(C) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\left( -C D v_i + n_i (\\ln C + \\ln D + \\ln v_i) - \\ln(n_i!) \\right) $$\nTo find the value of $C$ that maximizes $\\ell(C)$, we compute its derivative with respect to $C$ and set it to zero.\n$$ \\frac{d\\ell}{dC} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\left( -D v_i + \\frac{n_i}{C} \\right) = -D \\sum_{i=1}^{k} v_i + \\frac{1}{C} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i $$\nSetting the derivative to zero gives the MLE, denoted $\\hat{C}$:\n$$ -D \\sum_{i=1}^{k} v_i + \\frac{1}{\\hat{C}} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\hat{C}} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i = D \\sum_{i=1}^{k} v_i $$\nSolving for $\\hat{C}$ yields the general maximum likelihood estimator:\n$$ \\hat{C}_{\\text{MLE}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i}{D \\sum_{i=1}^{k} v_i} $$\nThis result is intuitively correct: the estimated concentration is the total number of observed colonies divided by the total equivalent volume from the original culture that was plated.\nFor the special case where all inoculated volumes are equal, $v_i = v$ for all $i=1, \\dots, k$, the denominator becomes $D \\sum_{i=1}^{k} v = D (k v)$.

For the given problem, $\\Lambda_{\\text{tot}} = C D k v$.\nWe must use the established relationship between the Poisson and chi-square distributions. For a Poisson random variable $X$ with mean $\\lambda$, the cumulative distribution functions are related as follows:\n$P(X \\ge x) = P(\\chi^2_{2x} \\le 2\\lambda)$\n$P(X \\le x) = P(\\chi^2_{2(x+1)} > 2\\lambda)$\nTo construct a two-sided $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval for $\\Lambda_{\\text{tot}}$, we find lower ($\\Lambda_L$) and upper ($\\Lambda_U$) bounds such that:\n$P(N_{\\text{tot}} \\ge n_{\\text{tot}} | \\Lambda_{\\text{tot}} = \\Lambda_L) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}$\n$P(N_{\\text{tot}} \\le n_{\\text{tot}} | \\Lambda_{\\text{tot}} = \\Lambda_U) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}$\nUsing the identities, the lower bound condition becomes $P(\\chi^2_{2n_{\\text{tot}}} \\le 2\\Lambda_L) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}$.

Let $\\chi^2_{\\nu}(q)$ denote the $q$-quantile of the chi-square distribution with $\\nu$ degrees of freedom.\n$$ 2\\Lambda_L = \\chi^2_{2n_{\\text{tot}}}(\\alpha/2) \\implies \\Lambda_L = \\frac{1}{2} \\chi^2_{2n_{\\text{tot}}}(\\alpha/2) $$\nThe upper bound condition becomes $P(\\chi^2_{2(n_{\\text{tot}}+1)} > 2\\Lambda_U) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}$, which is equivalent to $P(\\chi^2_{2(n_{\\text{tot}}+1)} \\le 2\\Lambda_U) = 1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}$. Thus, $2\\Lambda_U$ is the $(1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2})$-quantile of a chi-square distribution with $2(n_{\\text{tot}}+1)$ degrees of freedom.\n$$ 2\\Lambda_U = \\chi^2_{2(n_{\\text{tot}}+1)}(1-\\alpha/2) \\implies \\Lambda_U = \\frac{1}{2} \\chi^2_{2(n_{\\text{tot}}+1)}(1-\\alpha/2) $$\nSince $C = \\frac{\\Lambda_{\\text{tot}}}{D k v}$, the $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval for $C$ is obtained by dividing the interval for $\\Lambda_{\\text{tot}}$ by the constant factor $D k v$.
