The problem is self-contained, consistent, and does not violate any fundamental principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis begins with the definition of osmolality, which is a measure of the moles of solute particles per unit mass of solvent. It is a colligative property that depends on the number of solute particles, not their chemical nature. The osmolality, denoted $b_{\\mathrm{osm}}$, is defined as the product of the van 't Hoff factor, $i$, and the molality of the solute, $m$.\n$$b_{\\mathrm{osm}} = i \\cdot m$$\nThe molality $m$ is the amount of substance (moles) of solute, $n_{\\mathrm{solute}}$, per unit mass of solvent, $m_{\\mathrm{solvent}}$.\n$$m = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{solute}}}{m_{\\mathrm{solvent}}}$$\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles of glucose, $n_{\\mathrm{glc}}$, present in the solution. The mass of glucose is given as $m_{\\mathrm{glc}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{g}$, and its molar mass is $M_{\\mathrm{glc}}=180.156\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n$$n_{\\mathrm{glc}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{glc}}}{M_{\\mathrm{glc}}} = \\frac{100\\,\\mathrm{g}}{180.156\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}} \\approx 0.555075\\,\\mathrm{mol}$$\nThe mass of the solvent (water) is given as $m_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{kg}$. The molality of the glucose solution is therefore:\n$$m = \\frac{0.555075\\,\\mathrm{mol}}{1\\,\\mathrm{kg}} = 0.555075\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg^{-1}}$$\nGlucose is a non-dissociating solute, so its van 't Hoff factor is $i=1$. The osmolality is then:\n$$b_{\\mathrm{osm}} = i \\cdot m = 1 \\cdot 0.555075\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg^{-1}} = 0.555075\\,\\mathrm{Osm\\,kg^{-1}}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the osmolality is $0.5551\\,\\mathrm{Osm\\,kg^{-1}}$.\n\nNext, we compute the osmolarity. Osmolarity, denoted $C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$, is defined as the number of osmoles of solute per unit volume of the *solution*.\n$$C_{\\mathrm{osm}} = i \\cdot C$$\nwhere $C$ is the molar concentration (molarity) of the solute.\n$$C = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{solute}}}{V_{\\mathrm{solution}}}$$\nWe have already calculated the moles of solute, $n_{\\mathrm{glc}} \\approx 0.555075\\,\\mathrm{mol}$. To find the osmolarity, we must determine the volume of the solution, $V_{\\mathrm{solution}}$. This requires using the provided density of the solution, $\\rho$. The volume of the solution is the ratio of the total mass of the solution, $m_{\\mathrm{solution}}$, to its density, $\\rho$.\n$$V_{\\mathrm{solution}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{solution}}}{\\rho}$$\nThe total mass of the solution is the sum of the mass of the solute (glucose) and the mass of the solvent (water).\n$$m_{\\mathrm{solution}} = m_{\\mathrm{glc}} + m_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{g} + 1\\,\\mathrm{kg} = 0.100\\,\\mathrm{kg} + 1.000\\,\\mathrm{kg} = 1.100\\,\\mathrm{kg}$$\nUsing the given density, $\\rho=1.037\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,L^{-1}}$, we calculate the volume of the solution.\n$$V_{\\mathrm{solution}} = \\frac{1.100\\,\\mathrm{kg}}{1.037\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,L^{-1}}} \\approx 1.060752\\,\\mathrm{L}$$\nNow we can calculate the molarity, $C$.\n$$C = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{glc}}}{V_{\\mathrm{solution}}} = \\frac{0.555075\\,\\mathrm{mol}}{1.060752\\,\\mathrm{L}} \\approx 0.523258\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$$\nThe osmolarity is then found using $i=1$.\n$$C_{\\mathrm{osm}} = i \\cdot C = 1 \\cdot 0.523258\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}} = 0.523258\\,\\mathrm{Osm\\,L^{-1}}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the osmolarity is $0.5233\\,\\mathrm{Osm\\,L^{-1}}$.\n\nThe final values are an osmolality of $0.5551\\,\\mathrm{Osm\\,kg^{-1}}$ and an osmolarity of $0.5233\\,\\mathrm{Osm\\,L^{-1}}$. The discrepancy arises because osmolality is based on the mass of solvent, while osmolarity is based on the volume of the entire solution. For dilute aqueous solutions, their values are nearly identical, but for a concentrated solution such as this one ($10\\% $ by mass), the volume occupied by the solute and the deviation of the solution density from that of pure water ($1\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,L^{-1}}$) become significant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.5551 & 0.5233 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2546115"}, {"introduction": "While osmolarity measures total solute concentration $C_{\\text{total}}$, a cell's volume response is dictated by tonicity—the effective concentration of solutes that cannot cross the membrane, $C_{\\text{eff}}$.

It describes a classic osmotic response scenario, a cornerstone of cell physiology and biophysics. The concepts of osmolarity, tonicity (effective osmolarity), reflection coefficients, and the role of compatible solutes are standard. The given numerical values are realistic for a bacterial cell. The distinction between permeant (urea) and impermeant ($\\mathrm{NaCl}$, internal macromolecules) solutes is the critical element to be tested. The problem is a well-designed thought experiment which can be solved using the requested fundamental principles. It does not violate any physical laws or contain internal contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed to derive the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe governing principle for water movement across the cell membrane is that water flows to eliminate differences in its chemical potential. For dilute solutions, this is equivalent to stating that net water flux ceases when the effective osmotic pressure inside the cell equals that outside. The effective osmotic pressure, or tonicity, is calculated using the van 't Hoff equation, considering only membrane-impermeant solutes (or more generally, weighting each solute concentration $C_j$ by its reflection coefficient $\\sigma_j$).\nThe effective osmolarity is $C_{eff} = \\sum_j \\sigma_j C_j$.\nWater equilibrium is achieved when $C_{i,eff} = C_{e,eff}$.\n\nA crucial principle is the conservation of the number of moles of impermeant solutes within the cell, $n_{imp}$. The number of moles is related to concentration $C_{imp}$ and volume $V$ by $n_{imp} = C_{imp} \\cdot V$. If $n_{imp}$ is constant, then at two different equilibrium states (initial and final), we have $C_{imp,initial} \\cdot V_{initial} = C_{imp,final} \\cdot V_{final}$. This leads to the Boyle-van't Hoff relation for predicting equilibrium volume changes:\n$$V_{final} = V_{initial} \\frac{C_{i, imp, initial}}{C_{e, imp, final}}$$\nwhere $C_{i, imp, initial}$ is the initial internal effective osmolarity and $C_{e, imp, final}$ is the final external effective osmolarity.\n\n**Analysis for Medium 1**\n- **Initial State ($t=0^{-}$)**: The problem states that initially all intracellular solutes are impermeant. Therefore, the initial internal effective osmolarity is the sum of the nonreleasable and releasable components.\n$C_{i,eff}(0) = (200 + 100)\\,\\mathrm{mOsm} = 300\\,\\mathrm{mOsm}$.\n- **External Medium 1**: The medium is $150\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{NaCl}$. Since $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ dissociates into two ions ($\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$) and is membrane-impermeant ($\\sigma_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} \\approx 1$), its effective osmolarity is:\n$C_{e,eff,1} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} \\times (2 \\times 150\\,\\mathrm{mM}) \\approx 1 \\times 300\\,\\mathrm{mOsm} = 300\\,\\mathrm{mOsm}$.\n- **Volume Change**: At $t=0$, the spheroplast is placed in Medium 1. We compare the internal and external effective osmolarities:\n$C_{i,eff}(0) = 300\\,\\mathrm{mOsm}$\n$C_{e,eff,1} = 300\\,\\mathrm{mOsm}$\nSince $C_{i,eff}(0) = C_{e,eff,1}$, the external medium is isotonic to the cell. There is no net driving force for water movement.\nTherefore, the cell volume remains unchanged: $V(t) = V_0$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\n**Analysis for Medium 2**\n- **Initial State ($t=0^{-}$)**: Same as before, $V(0) = V_0$ and $C_{i,eff}(0) = 300\\,\\mathrm{mOsm}$. The initial number of moles of impermeant solutes is $n_{i,imp}(0) = (300\\,\\mathrm{mOsm}) \\cdot V_0$.\n- **External Medium 2**: The medium contains $75\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ and $150\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ urea. The external effective osmolarity is the sum of the contributions from each solute, weighted by its reflection coefficient:\n$C_{e,eff,2} = (\\sigma_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} \\times (2 \\times 75\\,\\mathrm{mM})) + (\\sigma_{\\mathrm{urea}} \\times 150\\,\\mathrm{mM})$\n$C_{e,eff,2} \\approx (1 \\times 150\\,\\mathrm{mOsm}) + (0 \\times 150\\,\\mathrm{mOsm}) = 150\\,\\mathrm{mOsm}$.\nMedium 2 is isosmotic ($300\\,\\mathrm{mOsm}$ total) but hypotonic ($150\\,\\mathrm{mOsm}$ effective).\n\n- **Phase 1: $0 \\le t < 5\\,\\mathrm{min}$ (Swelling and Urea Influx)**\nAt $t=0$, the cell is placed in Medium 2. Since $C_{i,eff}(0) > C_{e,eff,2}$ ($300\\,\\mathrm{mOsm} > 150\\,\\mathrm{mOsm}$), water will flow into the cell, causing it to swell. This process continues until the internal effective osmolarity decreases to match the external effective osmolarity. Let the new equilibrium volume be $V_{eq1}$.\nThe number of internal impermeant solutes remains constant during this phase: $n_{i,imp}(0) = (300\\,\\mathrm{mOsm}) \\cdot V_0$.\nAt equilibrium, $C_{i,eff}(eq1) = C_{e,eff,2}$.\n$$ \\frac{n_{i,imp}(0)}{V_{eq1}} = 150\\,\\mathrm{mOsm} $$\n$$ \\frac{(300\\,\\mathrm{mOsm}) \\cdot V_0}{V_{eq1}} = 150\\,\\mathrm{mOsm} $$\n$$ V_{eq1} = V_0 \\frac{300}{150} = 2V_0 $$\nSince water transport is quasi-instantaneous, the volume rapidly increases toward $2V_0$. During the subsequent $5$ minutes, urea slowly permeates into the cell until its internal concentration equals its external concentration ($150\\,\\mathrm{mM}$), but this does not affect the water equilibrium which is dictated by the impermeant solutes. Thus, by $t \\approx 5\\,\\mathrm{min}$, the cell volume is $V(5^{-}) \\approx 2V_0$.\n\n- **Phase 2: $t=5\\,\\mathrm{min}$ (Solute Expulsion)**\nAt $t=5\\,\\mathrm{min}$, the cell expels its entire pool of compatible solutes. The number of moles of these solutes is $n_r = (100\\,\\mathrm{mOsm}) \\cdot V_0$.\nThe number of impermeant moles remaining in the cell is only the nonreleasable portion:\n$n_{i,imp,new} = n_{nr} = (200\\,\\mathrm{mOsm}) \\cdot V_0$.\nThis expulsion is an abrupt event. Immediately after, at $t=5^{+}$, the volume is still $2V_0$, but the internal impermeant solute content has decreased.\n\n- **Phase 3: $t > 5\\,\\mathrm{min}$ (Reshrinking)**\nThe sudden drop in internal impermeant solutes creates a new osmotic imbalance. At $t=5^{+}$, the internal effective osmolarity is:\n$C_{i,eff}(5^{+}) = \\frac{n_{i,imp,new}}{V(5^{+})} = \\frac{(200\\,\\mathrm{mOsm}) \\cdot V_0}{2V_0} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mOsm}$.\nNow, $C_{i,eff}(5^{+}) < C_{e,eff,2}$ ($100\\,\\mathrm{mOsm} < 150\\,\\mathrm{mOsm}$). The external medium is now hypertonic to the cell. Water will flow out, causing the cell to shrink until a new equilibrium volume, $V_{eq2}$, is reached.\nAt this new equilibrium: $C_{i,eff}(eq2) = C_{e,eff,2}$.\n$$ \\frac{n_{i,imp,new}}{V_{eq2}} = 150\\,\\mathrm{mOsm} $$\n$$ \\frac{(200\\,\\mathrm{mOsm}) \\cdot V_0}{V_{eq2}} = 150\\,\\mathrm{mOsm} $$\n$$ V_{eq2} = V_0 \\frac{200}{150} = V_0 \\frac{4}{3} $$\nThis volume change is rapid. After the abrupt decrease to $(4/3)V_0$, the volume is maintained, as no further changes to solutes occur.\n\n**Summary of Volume Trajectories:**\n- **Medium 1**: $V(t) = V_0$ for all $t$.\n- **Medium 2**: $V(t)$ increases from $V_0$ to $2V_0$ during the interval $0 \\le t < 5\\,\\mathrm{min}$.

Water flux is driven by differences in effective osmolarity (tonicity), not total osmolarity. Medium 2 is hypotonic, causing water influx and swelling, not shrinkage. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Medium $1$: $V(t)=V_0$ for all $t$. Medium $2$: $V(t)=V_0$ for all $t$ because equal external osmolarity implies equal tonicity; compatible solute expulsion at $t=5\\,\\mathrm{min}$ has no effect on $V$.**\n- The description for Medium 1 is **Correct**.\n- The description for Medium 2 incorrectly equates osmolarity with tonicity. The presence of the permeant solute urea makes the isosmotic medium hypotonic, which must cause a volume change. Consequently, the claim that solute expulsion has no effect is also false. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Medium $1$: $V(t)$ decreases to $(1/2)V_0$ and remains there because $150\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ sodium chloride is hypertonic; Medium $2$: $V(t)$ decreases to $(1/2)V_0$ before $t=5\\,\\mathrm{min}$ because urea is osmotically ineffective; compatible solute expulsion at $t=5\\,\\mathrm{min}$ restores $V$ to $V_0$.**\n- The description for Medium 1 falsely claims the medium is hypertonic. It is isotonic ($300\\,\\mathrm{mOsm}$ external vs. $300\\,\\mathrm{mOsm}$ internal effective osmolarity). The volume does not change. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Medium $1$: $V(t)=V_0$ for all $t$. Medium $2$: $V(t)$ increases toward $2V_0$ by $t\\approx 5\\,\\mathrm{min}$; at $t=5\\,\\mathrm{min}$, compatible solute expulsion causes an abrupt further increase of $V$ to $4V_0$.**\n- The description for Medium 1 is **Correct**.\n- The prediction for the first phase in Medium 2 is correct ($V \\rightarrow 2V_0$). However, it incorrectly states that solute expulsion causes a further *increase* in volume. Expelling solutes lowers the internal effective osmolarity, causing water to *leave* the cell, resulting in shrinkage, not swelling. **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a rigorous step-by-step analysis, option A is the only one that correctly describes the behavior of the cell in both media according to the fundamental principles of osmosis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2546127"}, {"introduction": "In nature, microbes rarely exist as single, suspended cells; they form complex communities like biofilms where nutrient concentrations $C(x)$ and stresses are not uniform.

The resulting model, a steady-state reaction-diffusion equation, is a canonical and widely used framework in bioprocess engineering, chemical engineering, and microbiology for describing transport and reaction in biofilms and other porous media. All equations and concepts are standard and factually correct.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem describes a second-order linear ordinary differential equation with two specified boundary conditions (a Dirichlet condition at $x=0$ and a Neumann condition at $x=L$). This constitutes a well-posed Sturm-Liouville boundary value problem, which guarantees the existence of a unique and stable solution for the given parameters.\n- **Objective**: The problem statement is formulated using precise, quantitative, and unambiguous scientific language. There are no subjective elements or opinions.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It provides a complete and consistent set of information required for a unique solution. Therefore, a reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation of the steady-state solute concentration profile $C(x)$ is initiated by combining the given fundamental equations. Substituting Fick's law, $J(x) = -D \\, \\frac{dC}{dx}$, into the mass conservation equation, $\\frac{dJ}{dx} - k \\, C = 0$, yields:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( -D \\, \\frac{dC}{dx} \\right) - k \\, C = 0\n$$\nAssuming the effective diffusion coefficient $D$ is constant throughout the biofilm, this simplifies to a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation (ODE) with constant coefficients:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} - \\frac{k}{D} C = 0\n$$\nTo solve this equation, we introduce the characteristic length scale of reaction-diffusion, often represented by its inverse, $\\lambda$. Let $\\lambda^2 = \\frac{k}{D}$, so $\\lambda = \\sqrt{k/D}$. The ODE becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} - \\lambda^2 C = 0\n$$\nThe general solution to this ODE is conveniently expressed using hyperbolic functions:\n$$\nC(x) = A \\cosh(\\lambda x) + B \\sinh(\\lambda x)\n$$\nThe constants $A$ and $B$ are determined by applying the boundary conditions.\nThe first boundary condition at $x=0$ is $C(0) = C_{\\text{bulk}}$:\n$$\nC(0) = A \\cosh(0) + B \\sinh(0) = A \\cdot 1 + B \\cdot 0 = A\n$$\nThus, $A = C_{\\text{bulk}}$. The solution takes the form $C(x) = C_{\\text{bulk}} \\cosh(\\lambda x) + B \\sinh(\\lambda x)$.\n\nThe second boundary condition is the no-flux condition at the base $x=L$, which is $\\frac{dC}{dx}(L) = 0$. First, we find the derivative of $C(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dx} = C_{\\text{bulk}} \\lambda \\sinh(\\lambda x) + B \\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda x)\n$$\nApplying the condition at $x=L$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dx}(L) = C_{\\text{bulk}} \\lambda \\sinh(\\lambda L) + B \\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda L) = 0\n$$\nFor a non-trivial case where $\\lambda \\neq 0$ (i.e., $k>0$ and $D>0$), we can divide by $\\lambda$ and solve for $B$:\n$$\nB = -C_{\\text{bulk}} \\frac{\\sinh(\\lambda L)}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)} = -C_{\\text{bulk}} \\tanh(\\lambda L)\n$$\nSubstituting constants $A$ and $B$ back into the general solution gives:\n$$\nC(x) = C_{\\text{bulk}} \\cosh(\\lambda x) - C_{\\text{bulk}} \\tanh(\\lambda L) \\sinh(\\lambda x)\n$$\nThis expression can be simplified using the definition of $\\tanh$ and a hyperbolic identity:\n$$\nC(x) = C_{\\text{bulk}} \\left( \\cosh(\\lambda x) - \\frac{\\sinh(\\lambda L)}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)} \\sinh(\\lambda x) \\right) = C_{\\text{bulk}} \\frac{\\cosh(\\lambda L)\\cosh(\\lambda x) - \\sinh(\\lambda L)\\sinh(\\lambda x)}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)}\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\cosh(u-v) = \\cosh(u)\\cosh(v) - \\sinh(u)\\sinh(v)$, the final analytical solution for the concentration profile is:\n$$\nC(x) = C_{\\text{bulk}} \\frac{\\cosh(\\lambda(L-x))}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)}\n$$\nThis equation describes the solute concentration at any depth $x$ in the biofilm. It is also valid for the special case where the reaction rate constant $k=0$. In this case, $\\lambda = 0$, and using the limit $\\lim_{z \\to 0} \\cosh(z) = 1$, the solution correctly simplifies to $C(x) = C_{\\text{bulk}} \\frac{1}{1} = C_{\\text{bulk}}$. This constant profile is expected, as with no reaction ($k=0$) and no flux at the base, diffusion will equilibrate the concentration throughout the biofilm to that of the bulk fluid.\n\nWith the concentration profile $C(x)$ determined, the water activity profile $a_w(x)$ is calculated using the provided thermodynamic relation:\n$$\n\\ln a_w(x) = -i \\, v_w \\, C(x) \\implies a_w(x) = \\exp(-i \\, v_w \\, C(x))\n$$\nThe computational procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Given the parameters $(L, D, k, i, v_w, C_{\\text{bulk}})$, calculate $\\lambda = \\sqrt{k/D}$.\n2.  Define the five spatial points for evaluation: $x_{pts} = \\{0, L/4, L/2, 3L/4, L\\}$.\n3.  For each point $x$ in $x_{pts}$, calculate the concentration $C(x)$ using the derived formula.\n4.  For each calculated $C(x)$, compute the corresponding water activity $a_w(x) = \\exp(-i \\, v_w \\, C(x))$.\n5.  Round each $a_w(x)$ value to $6$ decimal places and collect the five values in a list.\n6.
