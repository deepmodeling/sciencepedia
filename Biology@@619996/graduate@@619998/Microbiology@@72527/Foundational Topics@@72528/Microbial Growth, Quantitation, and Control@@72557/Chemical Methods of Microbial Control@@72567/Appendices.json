We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem states that the rate of inactivation, $-\\frac{dN}{dt}$, is proportional to the number of viable cells, $N$, under conditions of constant disinfectant concentration, temperature, and pH. This is the definition of first-order inactivation kinetics, often referred to as Chick's law. Mathematically, this is expressed as a differential equation:\n$$ -\\frac{dN}{dt} = k' N $$\nwhere $k'$ is the first-order inactivation rate constant. The constant $k'$ incorporates the effects of disinfectant concentration, which is fixed in this experiment. This equation can be solved by separation of variables:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{N} = -k' dt $$\nWe integrate this equation from the initial time $t=0$, where the population is $N(0) = N_0$, to a general time $t$, where the population is $N(t)$.\n$$ \\int_{N_0}^{N(t)} \\frac{1}{N} dN = \\int_{0}^{t} -k' d\\tau $$\nThe integration yields:\n$$ \\ln(N(t)) - \\ln(N_0) = -k't $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\\right) = -k't $$\nExponentiating both sides gives the exponential decay model for the number of viable cells:\n$$ N(t) = N_0 \\exp(-k't) $$\nTo derive the functional form of $\\log_{10} N(t)$ versus $t$, we take the base-$10$ logarithm of both sides of the preceding equation:\n$$ \\log_{10}(N(t)) = \\log_{10}(N_0 \\exp(-k't)) $$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\log(ab) = \\log(a) + \\log(b)$, we have:\n$$ \\log_{10}(N(t)) = \\log_{10}(N_0) + \\log_{10}(\\exp(-k't)) $$\nUsing the change of base formula for logarithms, $\\log_{b}(x^y) = y \\log_{b}(x)$ and $\\log_{10}(e) = \\frac{\\ln(e)}{\\ln(10)} = \\frac{1}{\\ln(10)}$, we can write:\n$$ \\log_{10}(\\exp(-k't)) = -k't \\log_{10}(e) = -k't \\frac{1}{\\ln(10)} = -\\frac{k'}{\\ln(10)} t $$\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $\\log_{10}(N(t))$ yields the required functional form:\n$$ \\log_{10}(N(t)) = \\log_{10}(N_0) - \\left(\\frac{k'}{\\ln(10)}\\right) t $$\nThis equation is of the linear form $y = c + mx$, where $y = \\log_{10}(N(t))$, the independent variable is $x = t$, the y-intercept is $c = \\log_{10}(N_0)$, and the slope is $m = -\\frac{k'}{\\ln(10)}$. Thus, a plot of the base-$10$ logarithm of the viable cell concentration versus time is predicted to be a straight line with a negative slope.\n\nThe decimal reduction time, $D$, is defined as the time required to reduce the viable cell population by a factor of $10$, or by one logarithm on the base-$10$ scale. This means that at $t=D$, the population is $N(D) = \\frac{N_0}{10}$. We can use this definition to express $D$ in terms of the model parameters.

We have two relations: $m = -\\frac{k'}{\\ln(10)}$ and $D = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{k'}$. From the expression for the slope, we can write $k' = -m \\ln(10)$. Substituting this into the expression for $D$:\n$$ D = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{-m \\ln(10)} = -\\frac{1}{m} $$\nTherefore, the decimal reduction time is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the line obtained by plotting $\\log_{10} N$ against $t$.\n\nWe now perform an ordinary least squares linear regression on the provided dataset to estimate the slope $m$. Let the data points be $(t_i, y_i)$, where $y_i = \\log_{10} N(t_i)$. The number of data points is $n_p = 6$.

It is a standard exercise in reaction engineering and requires a rigorous derivation from the fundamental rate law. We will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental rate law for microbial inactivation, as stated by the Chick-Watson model which is first-order with respect to both the number of microorganisms, $N$, and the disinfectant concentration, $C(t)$, is given by the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k' C(t) N(t)\n$$\nwhere $k'$ is the specific inactivation rate constant. The negative sign indicates a reduction in the population of viable microorganisms.\n\nTo find the inactivation over a time interval from $t=0$ to a final time $t$, we must solve this differential equation. We can separate the variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{N(t)} = -k' C(t) dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides of the equation. The number of microorganisms changes from an initial value $N_{0}$ at $t=0$ to $N(t)$ at time $t$. The time variable of integration is denoted by $\\tau$ to distinguish it from the upper limit of integration $t$.\n$$\n\\int_{N_{0}}^{N(t)} \\frac{1}{N} dN = -k' \\int_{0}^{t} C(\\tau) d\\tau\n$$\nEvaluating the integral on the left side yields the natural logarithm:\n$$\n[\\ln(N)]_{N_{0}}^{N(t)} = \\ln(N(t)) - \\ln(N_{0}) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nThus, the relationship is:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_{0}}\\right) = -k' \\int_{0}^{t} C(\\tau) d\\tau\n$$\nThe problem requires an expression for the **base-ten log inactivation**. Log inactivation is defined as a positive value representing the reduction, which is $\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N_{0}}{N(t)}\\right)$. We can write this as $-\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_{0}}\\right)$.

The simplified approach approximates the integral term $\\int_{0}^{t} C(\\tau) d\\tau$ with the product $C_{0}t$. The given concentration profile is $C(\\tau) = C_{0}\\exp(-\\lambda \\tau)$, with $\\lambda > 0$. For any time $\\tau > 0$, the exponential term $\\exp(-\\lambda \\tau)$ is strictly less than $1$. Therefore, $C(\\tau)  C_{0}$ for all $\\tau > 0$.\n\nLet us compare the true integrated concentration with its simplified approximation:\n$$\n\\text{True integral} = \\int_{0}^{t} C_{0}\\exp(-\\lambda \\tau) d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Approximation} = \\int_{0}^{t} C_{0} d\\tau = C_{0}t\n$$\nSince $C_{0}\\exp(-\\lambda \\tau)  C_{0}$ for all $\\tau \\in (0, t]$, the value of the integral of the decaying function must be strictly less than the value of the integral of the constant function:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} C_{0}\\exp(-\\lambda \\tau) d\\tau  C_{0}t\n$$\nLet a target log inactivation be $L_{\\text{req}}$. The correct contact time, $t_{\\text{actual}}$, must satisfy:\n$$\nL_{\\text{req}} = k \\int_{0}^{t_{\\text{actual}}} C_{0}\\exp(-\\lambda \\tau) d\\tau\n$$\nThe simplified model would calculate a contact time, $t_{\\text{simple}}$, based on the assumption of constant concentration $C_0$:\n$$\nL_{\\text{req}} = k (C_{0}t_{\\text{simple}})\n$$\nEquating these expressions for $L_{\\text{req}}$ gives:\n$$\nk \\int_{0}^{t_{\\text{actual}}} C_{0}\\exp(-\\lambda \\tau) d\\tau = k (C_{0}t_{\\text{simple}})\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t_{\\text{actual}}} \\exp(-\\lambda \\tau) d\\tau = t_{\\text{simple}}\n$$\nAs established, for any positive time, the integrated value of the decaying exponential is less than the time itself. To achieve the required equality, the upper limit of integration for the lesser function must be larger. That is, $t_{\\text{actual}}$ must be greater than $t_{\\text{simple}}$. Therefore, the simplified calculation underpredicts the contact time required to achieve the target inactivation $L_{\\text{req}}$. Using $t_{\\text{simple}}$ would result in insufficient disinfection.\n\nFinally, we address the third task: defining and deriving the effective concentration-time, $CT_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t)$. From the fundamental inactivation equation, the term responsible for the extent of reaction is the time integral of concentration. We define this integral as the effective concentration-time product:\n$$\nCT_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t) \\equiv \\int_{0}^{t} C(\\tau) d\\tau\n$$\nThis quantity, when multiplied by the inactivation rate constant $k$, yields the true log inactivation.

The log-reduction is then:\n$$L_j = \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{N_0}{N(t_j)}\\right) = \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{N_0}{N_0 \\exp(-k_j C_j^{n_j} t_j)}\\right) = \\log_{10}(\\exp(k_j C_j^{n_j} t_j))$$\nUsing the logarithm base change rule, $\\log_b(a) = \\frac{\\ln(a)}{\\ln(b)}$, we obtain the computational formula for the achieved log reduction:\n$$L_j = \\frac{\\ln(\\exp(k_j C_j^{n_j} t_j))}{\\ln(10)} = \\frac{k_j C_j^{n_j} t_j}{\\ln(10)}$$\n\nA strategy $j$ is deemed feasible if it satisfies two conditions simultaneously:\n$1.$ A minimum standard log-reduction: $L_j \\ge 6$.\n$2.$ A risk-based survivor limit: The number of surviving organisms, even when starting from the high initial bioburden $Q_{0.95}(N_0)$, must be less than or equal to $1$ CFU. This is expressed as $Q_{0.95}(N_0) \\cdot 10^{-L_j} \\le 1$.\n\nThe second condition can be algebraically rearranged:\n$$10^{-L_j} \\le \\frac{1}{Q_{0.95}(N_0)} \\implies 10^{L_j} \\ge Q_{0.95}(N_0)$$\nTaking the base-$10$ logarithm of both sides yields:\n$$L_j \\ge \\log_{10}(Q_{0.95}(N_0))$$\nFor a strategy to be feasible, it must satisfy both log-reduction requirements. Therefore, the achieved log reduction $L_j$ must be greater than or equal to the maximum of the two thresholds. We define the minimum required log reduction, $L_{min}$, as:\n$$L_{min} = \\max\\!\\left(6, \\log_{10}(Q_{0.95}(N_0))\\right)$$\nA strategy $j$ is feasible if and only if $L_j \\ge L_{min}$.\n\nThe complete algorithm for each test case proceeds as follows:\n$1.$ Given the parameters for the initial bioburden distribution, $(\\mu, \\sigma)$, first compute the minimum required log reduction, $L_{min}$.\n    a. Determine the value of $z_{0.95}$.\n    b. Calculate $Q_{0.95}(N_0) = \\exp(\\mu + \\sigma z_{0.95})$.\n    c. Calculate $L_{min} = \\max(6, \\log_{10}(Q_{0.95}(N_0)))$.\n$2.$ Initialize an empty set to store feasible strategies and their associated costs.\n$3.$ For each candidate strategy $j$ with parameters $(C_j, t_j, k_j, n_j)$:\n    a. Calculate the achieved log reduction $L_j = \\frac{k_j C_j^{n_j} t_j}{\\ln(10)}$.\n    b. Compare $L_j$ with $L_{min}$. If $L_j \\ge L_{min}$, the strategy is feasible.\n    c. If feasible, calculate the cost surrogate $CT_j = C_j t_j$ and store the pair $(CT_j, j)$.\n$4.$ After evaluating all candidate strategies, analyze the set of feasible strategies.\n    a. If the set is empty, no strategy meets the requirements. The result is $-1$.\n    b. If the set is non-empty, select the strategy corresponding to the minimum $CT_j$. If multiple strategies share the minimum cost, the tie is broken by selecting the one with the smallest index $j$.\n$5.$ The final output for the test case is the index $j$ of the selected optimal strategy.\nThis procedure systematically identifies the most cost-effective strategy that adheres to the strict, risk-informed disinfection criteria.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Selects a chemical microbial control strategy by minimizing a cost surrogate\n    subject to a risk-based feasibility constraint derived from first-order\n    disinfection kinetics.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # z-score for 95% confidence level\n    # z_0.95 = Phi^-1(0.95)\n    z_095 = norm.ppf(0.95)\n\n    # Test cases: each is a tuple of (mu, sigma, list_of_strategies)\n    # Each strategy is a tuple of (C, t, k, n)\n    test_cases = [\n        (\n            11.512925464970229, 1.0,\n            [\n                (50.0, 20.0, 0.015, 1.0),\n                (100.0, 10.0, 0.012, 1.0),\n                (80.0, 15.0, 0.014, 1.0)\n            ]\n        ),\n        (\n            13.815510557964274, 1.0,\n            [\n                (50.0, 20.0, 0.015, 1.0),\n                (100.0, 10.0, 0.012, 1.0),\n                (80.0, 15.0, 0.014, 1.0)\n            ]\n        ),\n        (\n            16.11809565095832, 1.5,\n            [\n                (50.0, 20.0, 0.015, 1.0),\n                (100.0, 10.0, 0.012, 1.0),\n                (80.0, 15.0, 0.014, 1.0)\n            ]\n        ),\n        (\n            6.907755278982137, 0.2,\n            [\n                (100.0, 10.0, 0.0005, 2.0),\n                (20.0, 30.0, 0.0005, 2.0),\n                (40.0, 30.0, 0.0005, 2.0)\n            ]\n        )\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    ln_10 = np.log(10)\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        mu, sigma, strategies = case\n\n        # Step 1: Calculate the minimum required log reduction (L_min)\n        # Q_0.95(N0) = exp(mu + sigma * z_0.95)\n        q_095_n0 = np.exp(mu + sigma * z_095)\n        \n        # L_min = max(6, log10(Q_0.95(N0)))\n        l_min = max(6.0, np.log10(q_095_n0))\n        \n        feasible_strategies = []\n        \n        # Step 2  3: Evaluate each strategy for feasibility\n        for j, strategy_params in enumerate(strategies):\n            C_j, t_j, k_j, n_j = strategy_params\n            \n            # Calculate achieved log reduction: L_j = (k * C^n * t) / ln(10)\n            l_j = (k_j * np.power(C_j, n_j) * t_j) / ln_10\n            \n            # Check for feasibility\n            if l_j = l_min:\n                # Calculate cost surrogate: CT_j = C_j * t_j\n                ct_j = C_j * t_j\n                # Store the cost and index of the feasible strategy\n                feasible_strategies.append({'cost': ct_j, 'index': j})\n        \n        # Step 4: Select the optimal strategy\n        if not feasible_strategies:\n            # No feasible strategy found\n            results.append(-1)\n        else:\n            # Find the feasible strategy with the minimum cost.\n            # The primary sorting key is cost, and the secondary key is index (for tie-breaking).\n            optimal_strategy = min(feasible_strategies, key=lambda s: (s['cost'], s['index']))\n            results.append(optimal_strategy['index'])\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2482746"}]}
