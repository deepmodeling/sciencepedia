The solution must be derived strictly from conservation principles as stated. We will deconstruct the overall metabolic process into its two major stages: the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway, also known as glycolysis, and the subsequent fermentation of pyruvate to lactate.\n\nFirst, we analyze the stoichiometry of the EMP pathway for the catabolism of $1$ mole of glucose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$) to $2$ moles of pyruvate ($C_3H_4O_3$). This pathway is divided into an energy-investment phase and an energy-payoff phase.\n\nIn the preparatory, or energy-investment, phase, $2$ moles of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are consumed per mole of glucose.\n1. The phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, catalyzed by hexokinase, consumes $1$ mole of ATP.\n2. The phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, catalyzed by phosphofructokinase, consumes another mole of ATP.\nThus, the total ATP investment is $2$ moles.\n\nIn the payoff phase, the $6$-carbon fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is cleaved into two $3$-carbon molecules. All subsequent reactions, therefore, occur twice for each initial molecule of glucose.\n1. The oxidation of $2$ moles of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to $2$ moles of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate results in the reduction of $2$ moles of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ($NAD^+$) to $2$ moles of NADH. This is the sole redox reaction in glycolysis producing reducing equivalents.\n2. The conversion of $2$ moles of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to $2$ moles of 3-phosphoglycerate, a substrate-level phosphorylation step, generates $2$ moles of ATP.\n3. The conversion of $2$ moles of phosphoenolpyruvate to $2$ moles of pyruvate, another substrate-level phosphorylation step, generates an additional $2$ moles of ATP.\nThe total ATP produced in the payoff phase is therefore $2 + 2 = 4$ moles.\n\nThe net ATP yield from glycolysis is the total ATP produced minus the total ATP consumed:\n$$ \\text{Net ATP}_{\\text{glycolysis}} = (4 \\, \\text{moles}) - (2 \\, \\text{moles}) = 2 \\, \\text{moles} $$\nThe net production of NADH from glycolysis is:\n$$ \\text{Net NADH}_{\\text{glycolysis}} = 2 \\, \\text{moles} $$\nThe net reaction for glycolysis is:\n$$ C_6H_{12}O_6 + 2 \\, \\text{ADP} + 2 \\, P_i + 2 \\, NAD^+ \\rightarrow 2 \\, C_3H_4O_3 + 2 \\, \\text{ATP} + 2 \\, \\text{NADH} + 2 \\, H^+ + 2 \\, H_2O $$\n\nSecond, we analyze the fermentation step. Under anoxic conditions, the $2$ moles of NADH produced during glycolysis must be reoxidized to $NAD^+$ to sustain the glycolytic flux. The problem specifies homolactic fermentation, where pyruvate acts as the terminal electron acceptor. The reaction, catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase, is:\n$$ \\text{Pyruvate} + \\text{NADH} + H^+ \\rightarrow \\text{Lactate} + NAD^+ $$\nSince $2$ moles of pyruvate are produced from $1$ mole of glucose, this reaction consumes $2$ moles of NADH:\n$$ 2 \\, C_3H_4O_3 + 2 \\, \\text{NADH} + 2 \\, H^+ \\rightarrow 2 \\, C_3H_6O_3 + 2 \\, NAD^+ $$\nThis step does not involve any ATP consumption or production. Therefore, the ATP change during fermentation is $0$. The NADH consumed is $2$ moles.\n\nFinally, we determine the net yields for the complete process of converting $1$ mole of glucose to $2$ moles of lactate. We sum the changes from both stages.\n\nThe overall net ATP yield is the sum of the net ATP from glycolysis and the ATP change from fermentation:\n$$ \\text{Net ATP}_{\\text{total}} = \\text{Net ATP}_{\\text{glycolysis}} + \\text{ATP}_{\\text{fermentation}} = (2 \\, \\text{moles}) + (0 \\, \\text{moles}) = 2 \\, \\text{moles} $$\n\nThe net change in cytosolic NADH is the amount produced in glycolysis minus the amount consumed in fermentation:\n$$ \\Delta\\text{NADH}_{\\text{total}} = (\\text{NADH produced}) - (\\text{NADH consumed}) = (2 \\, \\text{moles}) - (2 \\, \\text{moles}) = 0 \\, \\text{moles} $$\nThis result of zero net change for the redox cofactor is a requisite for any sustainable anaerobic fermentation process, as the internal pool of $NAD^+$/NADH must be regenerated. It is a direct consequence of redox balance. The overall reaction is:\n$$ C_6H_{12}O_6 + 2 \\, \\text{ADP} + 2 \\, P_i \\rightarrow 2 \\, C_3H_6O_3 + 2 \\, \\text{ATP} + 2 \\, H_2O $$\nThis confirms mass conservation and demonstrates that the process is redox-neutral with no external electron acceptor.\n\nThe requested quantities are the net ATP yield ($2$ mol/mol glucose) and the net change in cytosolic NADH ($0$ mol/mol glucose).

Homolactic fermentation proceeds via the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathway. Substrate-level phosphorylation occurs at the phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate kinase steps. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) formed in glycolysis is reoxidized to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD$^{+}$) by lactate dehydrogenase without transmembrane proton translocation.\n\n2.

The stoichiometry of the EMP pathway for one mole of glucose is as follows:\n\n1.  Energy Investment Phase: Two kinase reactions consume ATP.\n    - Hexokinase: $\\text{Glucose} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{Glucose-6-phosphate} + \\text{ADP}$. This consumes $1$ mole of ATP.\n    - Phosphofructokinase: $\\text{Fructose-6-phosphate} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate} + \\text{ADP}$. This consumes $1$ mole of ATP.\n    - Total ATP investment is $2$ moles per mole of glucose.\n\n2.  Energy Payoff Phase: Substrate-level phosphorylation (SLP) generates ATP. The pathway splits the $6$-carbon sugar into two $3$-carbon units, so the following reactions occur twice per mole of glucose.\n    - Phosphoglycerate kinase: $2 \\times (\\text{1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate} + \\text{ADP} \\rightarrow \\text{3-Phosphoglycerate} + \\text{ATP})$. This generates $2$ moles of ATP.\n    - Pyruvate kinase: $2 \\times (\\text{Phosphoenolpyruvate} + \\text{ADP} \\rightarrow \\text{Pyruvate} + \\text{ATP})$. This generates $2$ moles of ATP.\n    - Total gross ATP production from SLP is $2 + 2 = 4$ moles per mole of glucose.\n\n3.  Redox Balance: During glycolysis, the oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate produces $2$ moles of NADH. The overall reaction for glycolysis is:\n    $$ \\text{Glucose} + 2 \\text{ ADP} + 2 P_i + 2 \\text{ NAD}^+ \\rightarrow 2 \\text{ Pyruvate} + 2 \\text{ ATP} + 2 \\text{ NADH} + 2 H^+ + 2 H_2O $$\n    The net yield from glycolysis alone is $4 - 2 = 2$ ATP.\n\n4.  Fermentation Step: The problem states that the $2$ moles of NADH are reoxidized to NAD$^+$ by lactate dehydrogenase, reducing pyruvate to lactate. This step does not involve transmembrane proton translocation and thus does not contribute to oxidative phosphorylation. It serves only to regenerate the NAD$^+$ required for glycolysis to continue.\n    $$ 2 \\text{ Pyruvate} + 2 \\text{ NADH} + 2 H^+ \\rightarrow 2 \\text{ Lactate} + 2 \\text{ NAD}^+ $$\n    Since there is no further energy capture, the total net yield for homolactic fermentation is solely from the SLP in glycolysis.\n\n    $$ Y_{\\mathrm{ferm}} = (\\text{ATP produced by SLP}) - (\\text{ATP invested}) = 4 - 2 = 2 $$\n\nPart 2: Calculation of ATP Yield for Anaerobic Respiration with Nitrate ($Y_{\\mathrm{nitrate}}$)\n\nThis process involves the complete oxidation of glucose to $CO_2$ coupled with an electron transport chain that uses nitrate as the terminal acceptor.\n\n1.  Yield of Energy Carriers: The problem statement provides the total yield from the complete oxidation of one mole of glucose via glycolysis, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.\n    - ATP from SLP: $2$ ATP from glycolysis plus $2$ GTP (counted as $2$ ATP) from the TCA cycle. Total SLP yield is $2 + 2 = 4$ ATP.\n    - Reducing equivalents: $10$ moles of NADH and $2$ moles of FADH$_2$.\n\n2.  Proton Translocation Stoichiometry: We calculate the total number of protons ($H^+$) translocated across the membrane, which will drive ATP synthesis. We must analyze the path of electrons from both NADH and FADH$_2$.\n\n    - For each mole of NADH ($2$ electrons):\n        - Electrons enter at NADH dehydrogenase (NDH-1), translocating $4 H^+$.\n        - Electrons are then transferred to nitrate reductase (NarGHI), which translocates an additional $2 H^+$.\n        - Total protons per NADH: $N_{H^+,\\text{NADH}} = 4 + 2 = 6 H^+$.\n        - Total protons from $10$ moles of NADH: $10 \\times 6 H^+ = 60 H^+$.\n\n    - For each mole of FADH$_2$ ($_2$ electrons):\n        - Electrons enter at succinate dehydrogenase, which does not pump protons ($0 H^+$).\n        - Electrons are then transferred to nitrate reductase (NarGHI), translocating $2 H^+$.\n        - Total protons per FADH$_2$: $N_{H^+,\\text{FADH}_2} = 0 + 2 = 2 H^+$.\n        - Total protons from $2$ moles of FADH$_2$: $2 \\times 2 H^+ = 4 H^+$.\n\n3.

ATP Synthesis from Oxidative Phosphorylation: The F$_1$F$_0$-ATP synthase uses the proton motive force to synthesize ATP. The problem specifies a cost of $4 H^+$ per ATP synthesized.\n    $$ \\text{ATP from OxPhos} = \\frac{\\text{Total } H^+ \\text{ translocated}}{\\text{Protons per ATP}} = \\frac{64}{4} = 16 \\text{ ATP} $$\n\n5.
