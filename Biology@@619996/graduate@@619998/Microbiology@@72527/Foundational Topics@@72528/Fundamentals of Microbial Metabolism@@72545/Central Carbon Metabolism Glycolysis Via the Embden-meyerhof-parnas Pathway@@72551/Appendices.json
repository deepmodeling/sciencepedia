The strain is cultivated aerobically in a defined salts medium with glucose as the sole carbon source. Assume the following well-tested facts as the fundamental base for reasoning:\n\n- In EMP glycolysis, enolase catalyzes the reversible conversion of $2$-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvate kinase uses phosphoenolpyruvate to form pyruvate with substrate-level phosphorylation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).\n- The phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) phosphotransferase system (PTS) imports glucose using PEP as the phosphoryl donor, producing pyruvate.\n- The Entner–Doudoroff (ED) pathway cleaves $2$-keto-$3$-deoxy-$6$-phosphogluconate into one pyruvate and one glyceraldehyde-$3$-phosphate.\n- Escherichia coli encodes the L-serine biosynthetic pathway from $3$-phosphoglycerate and L-serine deaminases that convert L-serine to pyruvate, and it encodes the methylglyoxal bypass, which converts dihydroxyacetone phosphate into methylglyoxal and ultimately D-lactate that can be oxidized to pyruvate.\n\nAll other cellular functions can be considered wild-type unless explicitly stated. Oxygen is in excess and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide cofactors are reoxidized by respiration as needed. No exogenous amino acids or organic acids are provided unless specified in an option.\n\nFrom these bases, reason about the network-level consequences of the enolase block on glucose catabolism and on ATP generation via substrate-level phosphorylation, and about endogenous or synthetic bypasses that could restore pyruvate production sufficiently for growth. Select all options that are jointly scientifically consistent with these constraints.\n\nA. On glucose minimal medium with the native PEP-dependent PTS active, an enolase deletion leads to a severe growth defect because the PEP pool collapses, eliminating both glucose import via PTS and ATP production at pyruvate kinase; growth can be partially restored by replacing PTS with a PEP-independent transporter plus glucokinase and by overexpressing the Entner–Doudoroff pathway, which yields pyruvate directly.\n\nB.

The conversion of $2$-phosphoglycerate ($2$PG) to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is blocked. This has two immediate, catastrophic effects for a cell grown on glucose:\n1.  **Cessation of PEP synthesis via glycolysis:** PEP, a critical high-energy intermediate and metabolic precursor, cannot be generated from upstream glycolytic intermediates like $3$PG.\n2.  **Failure of glucose uptake:** The primary system for glucose import in *E. coli*, the PTS, requires PEP as a phosphoryl donor. Without a glycolytic source of PEP, the PEP pool collapses, and glucose transport into the cell ceases.\n3.  **Loss of ATP generation at pyruvate kinase:** The substrate-level phosphorylation step catalyzed by pyruvate kinase (PEP + ADP $\\rightarrow$ Pyruvate + ATP) is eliminated.\n\nWith this foundation, we evaluate each option.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. On glucose minimal medium with the native PEP-dependent PTS active, an enolase deletion leads to a severe growth defect because the PEP pool collapses, eliminating both glucose import via PTS and ATP production at pyruvate kinase; growth can be partially restored by replacing PTS with a PEP-independent transporter plus glucokinase and by overexpressing the Entner–Doudoroff pathway, which yields pyruvate directly.**\n\nThis statement consists of two parts. First, it diagnoses the initial problem. As established in our primary analysis, the *eno* block prevents PEP synthesis from glucose, which in turn cripples the PTS-mediated glucose import and eliminates the ATP-generating pyruvate kinase step. This would undoubtedly lead to a severe growth defect. This part of the statement is correct.\n\nSecond, it proposes a synthetic rescue strategy.\n1.  Replacing the PTS with a PEP-independent transporter (e.g., GalP permease) and a glucokinase (*glk*) would restore the cell's ability to import glucose and phosphorylate it to glucose-$6$-phosphate, respectively, without consuming the non-existent PEP. This correctly addresses the glucose uptake problem.\n2.  Overexpressing the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway enzymes provides a route from glucose-$6$-phosphate to pyruvate that bypasses the enolase block. The ED pathway cleaves $2$-keto-$3$-deoxy-$6$-phosphogluconate into one molecule of pyruvate and one molecule of glyceraldehyde-$3$-phosphate (G3P). This directly restores the production of pyruvate, a crucial metabolic hub.\n\nThe combination of these two modifications constitutes a logical and biochemically sound strategy to restore a catabolic flux from glucose to pyruvate, thereby enabling growth. The reasoning is impeccable.\n\n**Verdict on A: Correct**\n\n**B. Overexpressing phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (ppsA) alone restores glycolytic flux from $3$-phosphoglycerate to pyruvate downstream of the enolase block by regenerating PEP and re-enabling ATP formation at pyruvate kinase.**\n\nThis statement fundamentally misinterprets the function of phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (PpsA). The reaction catalyzed by PpsA is: Pyruvate + ATP $\\rightarrow$ PEP + AMP + Pi. This is a gluconeogenic reaction that synthesizes PEP *from* pyruvate at a significant energy cost. The problem in the *eno* mutant is the inability to produce pyruvate from glycolytic intermediates. To use PpsA, the cell would need a source of pyruvate, which is precisely what is lacking. The statement proposes a circular solution that requires the product of the blocked pathway as a substrate for its own rescue. It cannot restore flux *from* $3$PG.\n\n**Verdict on B: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Redirecting $3$-phosphoglycerate carbon through L-serine biosynthesis (serA, serB, serC) followed by L-serine deamination (sdaA/sdaB) can re-establish a pyruvate-forming flux without regenerating PEP, and therefore cannot restore ATP formation at pyruvate kinase, though it can support oxidative metabolism of pyruvate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle.**\n\nThis option proposes an endogenous bypass. The intermediate $3$-phosphoglycerate ($3$PG) is the last metabolite produced in the EMP pathway before the enolase block. *E. coli* possesses the necessary enzymes to convert $3$PG into L-serine, and subsequently, L-serine deaminases can convert L-serine into pyruvate. This creates a valid biochemical route from $3$PG to pyruvate, circumventing the *eno* lesion.\n\nThis pathway proceeds as: $3$PG $\\rightarrow \\dots \\rightarrow$ L-Serine $\\rightarrow$ Pyruvate. It does not produce PEP as an intermediate. Consequently, the pyruvate kinase reaction, which requires PEP, cannot occur. The claim that this bypass cannot restore ATP formation at pyruvate kinase is correct. However, the pyruvate that is formed can be decarboxylated to acetyl-CoA, enter the TCA cycle, and drive ATP synthesis via oxidative phosphorylation, thus supporting aerobic metabolism. The statement is entirely consistent with biochemical reality.\n\n**Verdict on C: Correct**\n\n**D. Inducing the methylglyoxal bypass (mgsA, glyoxalase system) and D-lactate oxidation provides a pyruvate-forming route from dihydroxyacetone phosphate that reduces net substrate-level phosphorylation relative to standard EMP glycolysis and imposes methylglyoxal toxicity, but can enable slow aerobic growth.**\n\nThis option describes another endogenous bypass starting from the triose phosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). The pathway is: DHAP $\\xrightarrow{\\text{mgsA}}$ Methylglyoxal $\\xrightarrow{\\text{glyoxalase}}$ D-Lactate $\\xrightarrow{\\text{oxidase}}$ Pyruvate. This constitutes a valid bypass of the enolase block.\n\nWe must assess the energetic consequences. Standard EMP glycolysis of $1$ glucose yields a net of $2$ ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation (SLP). In the *eno* mutant utilizing this bypass, $1$ glucose is converted to $1$ DHAP and $1$ G3P (cost: $2$ ATP). The DHAP branch yields pyruvate without any SLP. The G3P branch yields $1$ ATP when $1,3$-bisphosphoglycerate is converted to $3$PG, after which the pathway halts. The net SLP is thus $1$ (yield) - $2$ (investment) = $-1$ ATP per glucose. This is a dramatic reduction compared to the normal $+2$ ATP. The claim is correct.\n\nMethylglyoxal is a reactive and toxic electrophile, and its accumulation is detrimental to the cell. Thus, imposing flux through this bypass carries a fitness cost of toxicity. This claim is also correct.\n\nFinally, despite the negative net SLP, the pyruvate produced can fuel the TCA cycle. Under aerobic conditions, the NADH produced from the G3P dehydrogenase step can be reoxidized by the electron transport chain, generating ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. This ATP production can be sufficient to overcome the SLP deficit and support slow growth.\n\n**Verdict on D: Correct**\n\n**E. Supplying acetate as the sole carbon source rescues growth because acetate enters central metabolism as acetyl-coenzyme A and neither glycolysis nor gluconeogenesis requires the enolase reaction for biomass precursor synthesis.**\n\nThis statement is critically flawed. For growth on acetate, a two-carbon substrate, the cell must perform gluconeogenesis to synthesize essential biomass precursors such as hexoses (for cell wall), pentoses (for nucleotides), and trioses (for lipids). Gluconeogenesis is largely the reverse of glycolysis. The pathway from oxaloacetate (derived from the glyoxylate shunt) to glucose-6-phosphate requires the conversion of PEP to $2$PG. This specific step is the reverse of the reaction blocked in the mutant, and it is catalyzed by the same enzyme, enolase. Since the *eno* gene is deleted, the enzyme is absent, and the gluconeogenic pathway is broken. The cell cannot synthesize sugars or many other key precursors from acetate.\n\n**Verdict on E: Incorrect**\n\n**F. Supplying gluconate as the carbon source and upregulating the Entner–Doudoroff enzymes allows formation of pyruvate even with the enolase block, but approximately half of the carbon accumulates upstream at glyceraldehyde-$3$-phosphate or $3$-phosphoglycerate unless complemented by an additional bypass from these triose intermediates.**\n\nMetabolism of gluconate proceeds via the ED pathway. Gluconate is phosphorylated to $6$-phosphogluconate, which is then converted to KDPG. The KDPG aldolase enzyme cleaves one molecule of KDPG (a C6 compound) into one molecule of pyruvate (C3) and one molecule of G3P (C3). This indeed allows for pyruvate formation, completely bypassing the enolase step.\n\nThe carbon split is precise: $50\\%$ of the gluconate carbon flows to pyruvate, and the other $50\\%$ flows to G3P. This G3P enters the lower part of the EMP pathway. It will be converted to $1,3$-bisphosphoglycerate, then to $3$PG, and finally to $2$PG. At this point, the pathway is blocked by the enolase deletion. Therefore, without a mechanism to drain the pool of C3 intermediates (G3P, 3PG, etc.), this half of the carbon from gluconate will accumulate. The statement accurately describes the metabolic fate of gluconate in this mutant.\n\n**Verdict on F: Correct**\n\n**Summary of Conclusions:**\n- Option A: Correct\n- Option B: Incorrect\n- Option C: Correct\n- Option D: Correct\n- Option E: Incorrect\n- Option F: Correct\n\nThe correct options, which are all jointly consistent with metabolic principles, are A, C, D, and F.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACDF}$$", "id": "2482195"}]}
