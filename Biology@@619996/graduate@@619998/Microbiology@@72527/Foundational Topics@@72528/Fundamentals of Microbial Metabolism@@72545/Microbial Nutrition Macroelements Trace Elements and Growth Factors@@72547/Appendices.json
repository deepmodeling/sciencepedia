This gives two possible solutions:\n$1$. The trivial (washout) steady state: $X^{\\ast} = 0$.\n$2$. The non-trivial (production) steady state: $X^{\\ast} \\gt 0$, which requires $\\mu(S^{\\ast}) = D$.\n\n**Part 1: Proof of Washout for $D > \\mu_{\\max}$**\n\nWe begin by assuming the existence of a non-trivial steady state, where $X^{\\ast} \\gt 0$. This necessitates that the steady-state substrate concentration, $S^{\\ast}$, must satisfy the condition:\n$$\n\\mu(S^{\\ast}) = D\n$$\nSubstituting the Monod relation for $\\mu(S^{\\ast})$:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\max}\\,\\frac{S^{\\ast}}{K_{s}+S^{\\ast}} = D\n$$\nWe must now solve this algebraic equation for $S^{\\ast}$ to demonstrate the consequence of the premise $D \\gt \\mu_{\\max}$.\n$$\n\\mu_{\\max}S^{\\ast} = D(K_{s}+S^{\\ast})\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_{\\max}S^{\\ast} = DK_{s} + DS^{\\ast}\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_{\\max}S^{\\ast} - DS^{\\ast} = DK_{s}\n$$\n$$\nS^{\\ast}(\\mu_{\\max} - D) = DK_{s}\n$$\nThis yields the expression for the steady-state substrate concentration:\n$$\nS^{\\ast} = \\frac{DK_{s}}{\\mu_{\\max} - D}\n$$\nNow, we analyze this result under the given condition $D \\gt \\mu_{\\max}$.\nThe parameters $D$ and $K_{s}$ are physical quantities and must be positive. Specifically, dilution rate $D \\gt 0$ and the half-saturation constant $K_s$ represents a concentration, so $K_s > 0$. Therefore, the numerator $DK_{s}$ is strictly positive.\nUnder the condition $D \\gt \\mu_{\\max}$, the term $(\\mu_{\\max} - D)$ in the denominator is strictly negative.\nConsequently, the value of $S^{\\ast}$ must be negative:\n$$\nS^{\\ast} = \\frac{(\\text{positive})}{(\\text{negative})} \\lt 0\n$$\nA negative substrate concentration is a physical impossibility. This is the explicit contradiction we sought. The initial assumption—that a non-trivial steady state ($X^{\\ast} \\gt 0$) can exist when $D \\gt \\mu_{\\max}$—leads to a physically absurd conclusion. Therefore, the assumption must be false. The only remaining physically possible steady state is the trivial one, $X^{\\ast}=0$, which corresponds to the complete washout of the microbial population from the reactor.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Influent Substrate Concentration**\n\nFor this part, the chemostat is to be operated at a steady state defined by $D = 0.60\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$ and $X^{\\ast} = 1.50\\,\\text{g}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$. The parameters are $\\mu_{\\max} = 0.80\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$, $K_{s} = 0.020\\,\\text{g}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$, and $Y_{X/S} = 0.50\\,\\text{g}\\,\\text{g}^{-1}$. The condition $D < \\mu_{\\max}$ ($0.60 < 0.80$) is satisfied, so a non-trivial steady state is achievable.\n\nFirst, we calculate the required steady-state residual substrate concentration, $S^{\\ast}$, that supports a specific growth rate equal to the dilution rate, $\\mu(S^{\\ast}) = D$. Using the formula derived in Part $1$:\n$$\nS^{\\ast} = \\frac{DK_{s}}{\\mu_{\\max} - D}\n$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\nS^{\\ast} = \\frac{(0.60\\,\\text{h}^{-1})(0.020\\,\\text{g}\\,\\text{L}^{-1})}{(0.80 - 0.60)\\,\\text{h}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.012\\,\\text{g}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}}{0.20} = 0.060\\,\\text{g}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}\n$$\nNext, we use the steady-state substrate balance (from Equation $2$ set to $0$):\n$$\n0 = D(S_{\\mathrm{in}} - S^{\\ast}) - \\frac{\\mu(S^{\\ast})X^{\\ast}}{Y_{X/S}}\n$$\nRecognizing that at this steady state $\\mu(S^{\\ast}) = D$, we can substitute $D$ for $\\mu(S^{\\ast})$:\n$$\n0 = D(S_{\\mathrm{in}} - S^{\\ast}) - \\frac{DX^{\\ast}}{Y_{X/S}}\n$$\nSince $D \\neq 0$, we can divide the entire equation by $D$:\n$$\n0 = (S_{\\mathrm{in}} - S^{\\ast}) - \\frac{X^{\\ast}}{Y_{X/S}}\n$$\nSolving for the influent substrate concentration $S_{\\mathrm{in}}$:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{in}} = S^{\\ast} + \\frac{X^{\\ast}}{Y_{X/S}}\n$$\nThis calculated $S_{\\mathrm{in}}$ represents the minimal concentration required in the feed to achieve the target biomass concentration $X^{\\ast}$ at the specified dilution rate $D$. Any influent concentration lower than this value would not be able to sustain the target biomass level. Thus, this is $S_{\\mathrm{in,min}}$.\n\nSubstituting the values for $S^{\\ast}$, $X^{\\ast}$, and $Y_{X/S}$:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{in,min}} = 0.060\\,\\text{g}\\,\\text{L}^{-1} + \\frac{1.50\\,\\text{g}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}}{0.50\\,\\text{g}\\,\\text{g}^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{in,min}} = 0.060\\,\\text{g}\\,\\text{L}^{-1} + 3.00\\,\\text{g}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{in,min}} = 3.060\\,\\text{g}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

The problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of microbial kinetics and thermodynamics, specifically the Pirt model for substrate consumption and the Arrhenius relation for temperature dependence. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and constants for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise, with one minor ambiguity. The statement \"The biomass yield on substrate is constant\" is inconsistent with the provided data if it refers to the *observed* yield $Y_{X/S}^{\\text{obs}} = \\mu/q_S$. For example, using the first data point, $Y_{X/S}^{\\text{obs}} = 0.10/2.60 \\approx 0.0385$, while for the last point, $Y_{X/S}^{\\text{obs}} = 0.60/8.10 \\approx 0.0741$. The yield is clearly not constant. The only scientifically consistent interpretation is that the statement refers to the *true* or *growth-associated* biomass yield, which is a fundamental parameter in the Pirt model. With this clarification, the problem is well-defined and solvable. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nWe now proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we justify the linear relationship between the specific substrate uptake rate, $q_S$, and the specific growth rate, $\\mu$. The total substrate consumed by the microbial population is partitioned into two primary metabolic fates: synthesis of new biomass (growth) and cellular maintenance functions (non-growth associated processes). This can be expressed as a mass balance on substrate utilization rate per unit of biomass:\n$$q_S = q_{S,\\text{growth}} + q_{S,\\text{maintenance}}$$\nThe rate of substrate consumption for growth, $q_{S,\\text{growth}}$, is directly proportional to the rate of biomass synthesis, $\\mu$. The proportionality constant is the inverse of the true biomass yield on a substrate, denoted here as $Y_{X/S}$. This yield represents the maximum possible conversion of substrate to biomass, assuming no substrate is diverted for maintenance. Thus,\n$$q_{S,\\text{growth}} = \\frac{1}{Y_{X/S}} \\mu$$\nThe rate of substrate consumption for maintenance, $q_{S,\\text{maintenance}}$, is assumed to be independent of the growth rate and is represented by the maintenance coefficient, $m$.\n$$q_{S,\\text{maintenance}} = m$$\nCombining these terms gives the Pirt equation:\n$$q_S = \\frac{1}{Y_{X/S}} \\mu + m$$\nThis equation is a linear model of the form $y = ax + b$, where $y = q_S$, $x = \\mu$, the slope is $a = 1/Y_{X/S}$, and the y-intercept is $b = m$. This justifies the linear relationship that is to be fitted to the data.\n\nNext, we perform an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression on the provided data to estimate the parameters $m$ and $Y_{X/S}$ at the reference temperature $T_{\\text{ref}} = 303.15\\,\\text{K}$. Let $x_i = \\mu_i$ and $y_i = q_{S,i}$ for the $n=5$ data points.\nThe OLS estimator for the slope, $a$, is given by:\n$$a = \\frac{n \\sum(x_i y_i) - (\\sum x_i)(\\sum y_i)}{n \\sum(x_i^2) - (\\sum x_i)^2}$$\nThe OLS estimator for the intercept, $b$, is:\n$$b = \\bar{y} - a \\bar{x}$$\nwhere $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum x_i$ and $\\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum y_i$.\n\nWe calculate the required sums from the data:\n- $\\sum x_i = 0.10 + 0.20 + 0.30 + 0.45 + 0.60 = 1.65$\n- $\\sum y_i = 2.60 + 3.70 + 4.80 + 6.45 + 8.10 = 25.65$\n- $\\sum x_i^2 = (0.10)^2 + (0.20)^2 + (0.30)^2 + (0.45)^2 + (0.60)^2 = 0.01 + 0.04 + 0.09 + 0.2025 + 0.36 = 0.7025$\n- $\\sum x_i y_i = (0.10)(2.60) + (0.20)(3.70) + (0.30)(4.80) + (0.45)(6.45) + (0.60)(8.10) = 0.26 + 0.74 + 1.44 + 2.9025 + 4.86 = 10.2025$\n\nNow we compute the slope $a$:\n$$a = \\frac{5(10.2025) - (1.65)(25.65)}{5(0.7025) - (1.65)^2} = \\frac{51.0125 - 42.3225}{3.5125 - 2.7225} = \\frac{8.69}{0.79} = 11.0$$\nAnd the intercept $b$:\n$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{1.65}{5} = 0.33$$\n$$\\bar{y} = \\frac{25.65}{5} = 5.13$$\n$$b = 5.13 - (11.0)(0.33) = 5.13 - 3.63 = 1.50$$\nFrom the regression, we identify the maintenance coefficient at the reference temperature, $T_{\\text{ref}}$, as the intercept: $m(T_{\\text{ref}}) = b = 1.50\\,\\text{mmol glucose}\\,\\text{g}_{\\text{DCW}}^{-1}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$.

This fraction is defined as:\n$$ f_{\\text{CO}_2} = \\frac{\\text{mass of carbon oxidized to } \\text{CO}_2}{\\text{mass of carbon in consumed substrate}} $$\nFrom the carbon balance, it follows that the fraction of carbon oxidized is complementary to the fraction of carbon assimilated into biomass, $f_{biomass}$.\n$$ f_{\\text{CO}_2} = 1 - f_{biomass} $$\nwhere\n$$ f_{biomass} = \\frac{\\text{mass of carbon assimilated into biomass}}{\\text{mass of carbon in consumed substrate}} $$\nTo calculate these fractions, we will consider an arbitrary mass of consumed substrate, $m_S$.\n\nThe mass of carbon in the consumed substrate, $C_{in}$, is given by the product of the substrate mass and the mass fraction of carbon in the substrate, $w_{C,S}$.\n$$ C_{in} = m_S \\cdot w_{C,S} $$\nThe mass of biomass produced, $m_X$, is determined by the yield coefficient $Y_{X/S}$:\n$$ m_X = m_S \\cdot Y_{X/S} $$\nThe mass of carbon assimilated into this biomass, $C_{biomass}$, is the product of the biomass mass and the mass fraction of carbon in the biomass, $w_{C,X}$.\n$$ C_{biomass} = m_X \\cdot w_{C,X} = (m_S \\cdot Y_{X/S}) \\cdot w_{C,X} $$\nNow, we can express the fraction of assimilated carbon, $f_{biomass}$, in terms of the given parameters:\n$$ f_{biomass} = \\frac{C_{biomass}}{C_{in}} = \\frac{(m_S \\cdot Y_{X/S}) \\cdot w_{C,X}}{m_S \\cdot w_{C,S}} = \\frac{Y_{X/S} \\cdot w_{C,X}}{w_{C,S}} $$\nThe next step is to calculate the mass fractions of carbon in the substrate ($w_{C,S}$) and in the biomass ($w_{C,X}$).\n\nFirst, for the substrate, glucose ($\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{12}\\text{O}_6$):\nThe molar mass of glucose, $M_S$, is:\n$$ M_S = 6 \\cdot M_C + 12 \\cdot M_H + 6 \\cdot M_O = 6(12) + 12(1) + 6(16) = 72 + 12 + 96 = 180\\ \\text{g mol}^{-1} $$\nThe mass of carbon in one mole of glucose is $6 \\cdot M_C = 72\\ \\text{g}$.\nThe mass fraction of carbon in glucose, $w_{C,S}$, is:\n$$ w_{C,S} = \\frac{6 \\cdot M_C}{M_S} = \\frac{72}{180} = 0.4 $$\n\nNext, for the biomass, with empirical formula $\\text{C}\\text{H}_{1.8}\\text{O}_{0.5}\\text{N}_{0.2}$:\nThe formula mass of this empirical unit, $M_{X,formula}$, is:\n$$ M_{X,formula} = 1 \\cdot M_C + 1.8 \\cdot M_H + 0.5 \\cdot M_O + 0.2 \\cdot M_N $$\n$$ M_{X,formula} = 1(12) + 1.8(1) + 0.5(16) + 0.2(14) = 12 + 1.8 + 8 + 2.8 = 24.6\\ \\text{g} $$\nThis mass corresponds to one mole of carbon atoms. The mass of carbon in this formula unit is $1 \\cdot M_C = 12\\ \\text{g}$.\nThe mass fraction of carbon in the biomass, $w_{C,X}$, is:\n$$ w_{C,X} = \\frac{1 \\cdot M_C}{M_{X,formula}} = \\frac{12}{24.6} $$\n\nNow we can compute the fraction of carbon assimilated into biomass, $f_{biomass}$, using the given yield coefficient $Y_{X/S} = 0.5$.\n$$ f_{biomass} = \\frac{Y_{X/S} \\cdot w_{C,X}}{w_{C,S}} = \\frac{0.5 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{12}{24.6}\\right)}{0.4} = \\frac{0.5 \\cdot 12}{0.4 \\cdot 24.6} = \\frac{6}{9.84} $$\nFinally, we calculate the fraction of substrate carbon oxidized to $\\text{CO}_2$, $f_{\\text{CO}_2}$:\n$$ f_{\\text{CO}_2} = 1 - f_{biomass} = 1 - \\frac{6}{9.84} = 1 - 0.609756... $$\n$$ f_{\\text{CO}_2} \\approx 0.3902439... $$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ f_{\\text{CO}_2} \\approx 0.3902 $$\nThis is the fraction of the initial carbon in the glucose that is respired as carbon dioxide.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3902}$$", "id": "2511360"}]}
