A fundamental question is why such a complex system evolved in place of a simple permease coupled with a cytosolic kinase. The answer lies in its remarkable bioenergetic efficiency. This exercise moves beyond simple adenosine triphosphate ($ATP$) counting to the more sophisticated concept of metabolic opportunity cost, which is critical for understanding cellular resource allocation. By calculating the net $ATP$ savings of the PTS, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how coupling transport directly to a high-energy phosphate donor, phosphoenolpyruvate ($PEP$), conserves a cell's most valuable energetic currency. [@problem_id:2497898]", "problem": "A facultative bacterium can import glucose either by a permease followed by cytosolic phosphorylation or by the phosphotransferase system (PTS). In the permease route, cytosolic hexokinase consumes $1$ molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to phosphorylate glucose to glucose-$6$-phosphate. In the PTS route, one molecule of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) donates its phosphate to glucose during transport, yielding glucose-$6$-phosphate without direct ATP hydrolysis. The downstream metabolism of PEP partitions between two fates: pyruvate kinase (which generates $1$ ATP per PEP converted to pyruvate) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (which generates $0$ ATP per PEP converted to oxaloacetate). Under the specified condition, a steady-state fraction $\\alpha = 0.37$ of PEP flux is obligatorily diverted to oxaloacetate via phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, while the remaining fraction $1-\\alpha$ proceeds through pyruvate kinase.\n\nAssume the PEP consumed by the PTS would have otherwise followed the same fractional fates as the bulk PEP pool.

We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the net savings in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) when a molecule of glucose is imported via the phosphotransferase system (PTS) relative to the permease-plus-hexokinase route. This saving, denoted as $\\Delta C_{ATP}$, is defined as the difference between the total energetic cost of the permease route, $C_{perm}$, and the total energetic cost of the PTS route, $C_{PTS}$. The total cost includes both direct ATP consumption and the opportunity cost associated with the consumption of high-energy intermediates like phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP).\n\n$$\n\\Delta C_{ATP} = C_{perm} - C_{PTS}\n$$\n\nFirst, we analyze the permease-plus-hexokinase route. The problem states that this pathway consumes $1$ molecule of ATP for the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-$6$-phosphate by hexokinase. This is a direct energetic cost. This route does not directly consume PEP for the import and phosphorylation step. Therefore, the total cost for this route is exclusively the direct ATP consumption.\n\n$$\nC_{perm} = 1 \\text{ ATP}\n$$\n\nNext, we analyze the PTS route. This system utilizes $1$ molecule of PEP to phosphorylate glucose during its transport, yielding glucose-$6$-phosphate. The problem states this occurs without direct ATP hydrolysis, so the direct ATP cost is $0$. However, the consumption of $1$ molecule of PEP incurs an opportunity cost. This cost is equivalent to the amount of ATP that would have been generated had this molecule of PEP not been used for transport and instead proceeded through its downstream metabolic fates.\n\nThe problem specifies that the cellular PEP pool is partitioned between two fates: a fraction $(1-\\alpha)$ is converted to pyruvate via pyruvate kinase, generating $1$ ATP per PEP, and a fraction $\\alpha$ is converted to oxaloacetate via phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, generating $0$ ATP per PEP. The given fraction diverted to oxaloacetate is $\\alpha = 0.37$. The expected ATP yield from one molecule of PEP, which represents the opportunity cost of its consumption by the PTS, is therefore:\n\n$$\n\\text{Opportunity Cost} = (1-\\alpha) \\times 1 \\text{ ATP} + \\alpha \\times 0 \\text{ ATP} = (1-\\alpha) \\text{ ATP}\n$$\n\nThe total cost for the PTS route is the sum of its direct ATP cost and its opportunity cost.\n\n$$\nC_{PTS} = 0 \\text{ ATP} + (1-\\alpha) \\text{ ATP} = (1-0.37) \\text{ ATP} = 0.63 \\text{ ATP}\n$$\n\nNow we can compute the net ATP savings per molecule of glucose.\n\n$$\n\\Delta C_{ATP} = C_{perm} - C_{PTS} = 1 \\text{ ATP} - (1-\\alpha) \\text{ ATP} = 1 - (1 - 0.37) \\text{ ATP} = 1 - 0.63 \\text{ ATP} = 0.37 \\text{ ATP}\n$$\n\nAlternatively, the calculation can be expressed symbolically until the final step.\n\n$$\n\\Delta C_{ATP} = 1 - (1-\\alpha) = 1 - 1 + \\alpha = \\alpha\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given value for $\\alpha$:\n\n$$\n\\Delta C_{ATP} = 0.37 \\text{ ATP}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

There are no identifiable flaws. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe dynamics of the intracellular free glucose concentration, $c_{\\mathrm{in}}$, are governed by a mass balance equation. The rate of change of $c_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is the sum of the rate of influx and the rate of consumption.\nThe net flux of glucose into the cell via the reversible uniporter is proportional to the concentration difference, $c_{\\mathrm{out}} - c_{\\mathrm{in}}$. The rate of change in intracellular concentration due to this process is given by $P_{u}(c_{\\mathrm{out}} - c_{\\mathrm{in}})$.\nThe removal of intracellular glucose by the PTS is modeled as a pseudo-first-order process with rate constant $k_{p}$.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded question. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Expected Phenotype and Mechanism**\n\nThe central feature of the mutant is the deletion of *ptsH*, which encodes HPr. This breaks the phosphorelay chain:\n$$PEP \\xrightarrow{EI} P \\sim EI \\quad \\xcancel{\\xrightarrow{HPr}} \\quad P \\sim HPr \\xrightarrow{EIIA} ...$$\nThe phosphate group (P) from PEP is transferred to EI, but cannot proceed to HPr. This has several critical consequences.\n\n1.  **Transport of PTS Sugars**: The transport of PTS sugars, such as glucose, is tightly coupled to their phosphorylation by the PTS cascade. Since the phosphate group cannot be relayed past EI, the sugar-specific enzymes EIIB and EIIC will not be activated. Thus, the mutant will be unable to transport and phosphorylate glucose via the PTS. This predicts no growth on glucose as a sole carbon source.\n\n2.  **Regulatory State of EIIA$^{\\mathrm{Glc}}$**: EIIA$^{\\mathrm{Glc}}$ receives its phosphate from HPr. In the absence of HPr, EIIA$^{\\mathrm{Glc}}$ cannot be phosphorylated. Therefore, it will accumulate in its unphosphorylated form.\n\n3.  **Global Regulatory Consequences**: The state of EIIA$^{\\mathrm{Glc}}$ controls two major regulatory circuits:\n    - **Inducer Exclusion**: Unphosphorylated EIIA$^{\\mathrm{Glc}}$ is the active species that mediates inducer exclusion. It directly binds to and inhibits several non-PTS transport systems. This includes the lactose permease (LacY) and glycerol kinase (GlpK), which is the first enzymatic step in glycerol utilization after transport by the GlpF facilitator. Consequently, the uptake and/or initial metabolism of lactose and glycerol will be severely inhibited.\n    - **Catabolite Repression**: The synthesis of cAMP by adenylate cyclase is activated by phosphorylated EIIA$^{\\mathrm{Glc}}$ (P~EIIA$^{\\mathrm{Glc}}$). Since EIIA$^{\\mathrm{Glc}}$ is unphosphorylated in the *ptsH* mutant, adenylate cyclase will be inactive. This leads to a drastic reduction in intracellular cAMP levels. Low cAMP prevents the formation of the cAMP-CAP complex, which is a required transcriptional activator for many catabolic operons, including those for lactose, glycerol, and succinate utilization.\n\n4.  **Phenotype Synthesis**:\n    - **On Glucose**: No growth due to failure of transport/phosphorylation.\n    - **On Lactose**: Severe growth defect due to a combination of inducer exclusion (inhibiting transport) and low cAMP (inhibiting *lac* operon transcription).\n    - **On Glycerol**: Severe growth defect due to a combination of inducer exclusion (inhibiting GlpK) and low cAMP (inhibiting *glp* operon transcription).\n    - **On Succinate**: Poor growth. Succinate metabolism is primarily affected by the lack of cAMP-CAP-dependent transcriptional activation. Inducer exclusion is not known to be a primary mechanism for inhibiting succinate uptake.\n\n5.  **Effect of Exogenous cAMP**:\n    - Adding cAMP externally bypasses the inactive adenylate cyclase, restoring the cell's ability to activate cAMP-dependent operons.\n    - **On Lactose and Glycerol**: Growth will remain strongly defective because inducer exclusion, a direct protein-protein interaction inhibiting transport/metabolism, is not relieved by cAMP.\n    - **On Succinate**: Growth should be robustly restored. The primary limitation was transcriptional, which is now alleviated by the exogenous cAMP.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. No detectable growth on PTS sugars such as glucose, but normal growth on all non-PTS sugars such as lactose, glycerol, and succinate; exogenous cAMP has no effect. Mechanism: PTS only affects transport of PTS sugars and has no global regulatory role.**\n- **Evaluation**: The phenotype described is incorrect; there will be strong growth defects on non-PTS sugars. The mechanism is explicitly false, as it denies the well-established and problem-stated global regulatory roles of the PTS.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B.

The mechanism provided is a precise and accurate summary of the consequences of a *ptsH* deletion: broken phosphorelay, unphosphorylated EIIA$^{\\mathrm{Glc}}$, consequent inducer exclusion and failed adenylate cyclase activation, and the differential rescue by exogenous cAMP depending on the presence or absence of inducer exclusion for a given substrate.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**C.

First, while alternative kinases like glucokinase exist, they cannot support \"near-normal\" growth on glucose as a sole carbon source in the absence of the primary PTS pathway. Growth is extremely poor. Second, it falsely claims \"no effect on non-PTS sugars,\" ignoring the severe regulatory defects (inducer exclusion, catabolite repression) that are the main point of the problem.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. No detectable growth on PTS sugars; enhanced growth on non-PTS sugars because EIIA$^{\\mathrm{Glc}}$ becomes constitutively phosphorylated, thereby stimulating adenylate cyclase to generate high cAMP; exogenous cAMP is unnecessary. Mechanism: Blocking HPr traps phosphate on EI, causing EIIA$^{\\mathrm{Glc}}$ to accumulate in the phosphorylated state and activate non-PTS metabolism.**\n- **Evaluation**: The proposed mechanism is fundamentally flawed. The deletion of HPr breaks the link between EI and EIIA$^{\\mathrm{Glc}}$. Phosphate cannot be transferred to EIIA$^{\\mathrm{Glc}}$. Therefore, EIIA$^{\\mathrm{Glc}}$ will be unphosphorylated, not phosphorylated. This error in logic leads to the exact opposite prediction for the regulatory state (low cAMP, not high; active inducer exclusion, not relief from it) and the resulting phenotype (growth inhibition on non-PTS sugars, not enhancement).\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2497905"}]}
