Monensin is a sodium ionophore: it collapses the $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ gradient by exchanging $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ for $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$, effectively dissipating SMF on short timescales in a $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-containing medium.

Predictions: For PMF-coupled respiration, CCCP increases oxygen consumption and lowers ATP; monensin has little effect. For SMF-coupled respiration, monensin increases oxygen consumption and lowers ATP; CCCP has little effect. Combined addition yields maximal oxygen consumption and minimal ATP. This aligns precisely with chemiosmotic expectations and uses short-timescale measurements to discriminate coupling. Verdict — Correct.\n\nOption B: Claims that both ionophores decrease oxygen consumption and increase ATP in both coupling modes. This reverses chemiosmotic predictions: uncouplers relieve back-pressure and increase electron flux (thus increasing oxygen consumption) while decreasing ATP synthesis by collapsing the driving force. Moreover, if both treatments produce similar outcomes, discrimination would be impossible, contradicting the stated goal. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption C: Places cells in $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-free buffer, then asserts that monensin increases ATP and decreases oxygen consumption in PMF-coupled cells, and that CCCP has no effect, while in SMF-coupled cells CCCP is the effective uncoupler. These predictions conflict with first principles: in PMF-coupled cells, monensin is not expected to strengthen PMF and raise ATP; rather, it primarily targets SMF (which is minimal in $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-free buffer) and should have little effect. CCCP should effectively collapse PMF regardless of external $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and thus should increase oxygen consumption and reduce ATP in PMF-coupled cells. The SMF case is also inverted. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption D: Introduces oligomycin (an inhibitor of the $\\mathrm{F}_{1}\\mathrm{F}_{0}$-ATP synthase) to infer coupling. In bacteria, oligomycin variably affects $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$-dependent ATP synthases and is not a reliable discriminator of coupling to $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ versus $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$. The predicted increases in ATP upon ATP synthase inhibition are incorrect for short timescales; inhibition prevents ATP synthesis and typically lowers $[\\mathrm{ATP}]$ unless substrate-level phosphorylation compensates, which is not assumed here. The claim that monensin has no effect on SMF-coupled respiration contradicts its role as a sodium ionophore. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption E: Asserts that in PMF-coupled cells, CCCP decreases oxygen consumption and increases ATP, which is opposite to chemiosmotic predictions, and that monensin produces the uncoupling signature in PMF-coupled cells; for SMF-coupled cells, it states that both ionophores act as uncouplers with a larger effect for monensin. These statements are inconsistent: CCCP should not uncouple SMF-coupled respiration effectively on short timescales, and in PMF-coupled cells it should increase oxygen consumption and decrease ATP.
