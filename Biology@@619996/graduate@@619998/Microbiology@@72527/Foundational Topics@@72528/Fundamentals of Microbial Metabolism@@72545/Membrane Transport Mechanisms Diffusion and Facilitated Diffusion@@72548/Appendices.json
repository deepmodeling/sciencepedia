It is based on the fundamental principle of Fickian diffusion and provides realistic physical parameters for a standard estimation problem in cellular biophysics.

The problem can be solved using scaling analysis, which provides an order-of-magnitude estimate by replacing differential operators with characteristic scales of the system.\n\nWe assume no advective flow and an isotropic medium, consistent with the problem's description of \"thermal motion\" in a \"well-mixed cytosol.\" Let $L$ be the characteristic length scale over which the concentration gradient exists.

Let $\\tau$ be the characteristic time scale for the concentration profile to homogenize over the distance $L$.\n\nThe left-hand side of the equation, the time derivative $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t}$, can be approximated by the ratio of a characteristic change in concentration, $\\Delta c$, to the characteristic time $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} \\sim \\frac{\\Delta c}{\\tau}\n$$\nThe right-hand side involves the Laplacian operator, $\\nabla^2$. The Laplacian represents the spatial curvature of the concentration field. In one dimension, it is the second spatial derivative, $\\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2}$. The gradient, or first derivative $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$, scales as the characteristic concentration difference $\\Delta c$ divided by the characteristic length $L$, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} \\sim \\frac{\\Delta c}{L}$.

The calculated time of approximately $100\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ is the characteristic time for a small molecule to diffuse across a bacterium. Many cellular processes are much slower. For instance, gene transcription and protein translation take seconds to minutes, and cell division takes tens of minutes. Compared to these processes, a diffusion time of $100\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ is effectively instantaneous. Therefore, for processes on these slower time scales, the cytosol can indeed be considered \"well-mixed,\" and diffusion is not rate-limiting.\n\nHowever, the situation is different for rapid metabolic pathways. The turnover rates of efficient enzymes can be on the order of $10^3$ to $10^4\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, meaning individual catalytic events occur on a time scale of $0.1$ to $1\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. For a sequence of such enzymes, a diffusion time of $100\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ between active sites would be prohibitively slow and would severely limit the overall flux of the pathway. This apparent paradox is resolved by the fact that cells are not truly \"well-mixed\" at the microscale. Many enzymes belonging to the same metabolic pathway are organized into physical complexes, known as metabolons, or are localized to specific regions of the cell. This spatial organization dramatically reduces the diffusion distances between sequential active sites, thereby ensuring that transport does not become the rate-limiting step in metabolism.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.00 \\times 10^2}$$", "id": "2506268"}, {"introduction": "Having established a baseline for diffusion within the cytosol, we now turn our attention to the primary obstacle: the lipid bilayer.
