The conserved Walker A phosphate-binding loop in P-loop NTPases has the consensus sequence Gly-x-x-x-x-Gly-Lys-Thr/Ser, where the lysine side chain stabilizes the phosphate moieties of bound nucleotides. Consider a bacterial, binding-protein-dependent ABC importer reconstituted into proteoliposomes with saturating periplasmic binding protein and radiolabeled substrate outside.

Conditions include saturating periplasmic binding protein and radiolabeled substrate located outside the proteoliposomes.\n- **Mutation:** A Lysine-to-Alanine (Lys-to-Ala) substitution is introduced at the conserved Walker A lysine position in each of the two Nucleotide-Binding Domains (NBDs).\n- **Structural Integrity Control:** Biogenesis controls have verified that folding, membrane insertion, and complex assembly of the mutant transporter are intact.\n- **Functional Assay Conditions:** Substrate uptake assays are performed with an external ATP concentration of $[\\mathrm{ATP}] = 2\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, saturating substrate, and no competing Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP).\n- **Wild-Type (WT) Parameters:** The ATP dissociation constant for the WT NBD is $K_d \\approx 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.

The role of the Walker A lysine side chain is to stabilize the phosphate moieties of bound nucleotides.\n    3. ATP-bound NBD dimerization is a requirement for the transport power stroke.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The ABC transporter mechanism, the role of the Walker A motif and its conserved lysine, and the experimental setup (proteoliposome reconstitution, uptake assays) are all standard and well-established concepts in molecular biology and biophysics. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient information to deduce the functional consequences of the specified mutation. It is objective and free of ambiguity. The provided constants ($K_d$ for WT) and experimental conditions ($[\\mathrm{ATP}]$) are physically realistic. The question asks for a specific, predictable outcome based on these first principles. There are no contradictions, missing data, or other logical flaws.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the consequence of substituting lysine (Lys) with alanine (Ala) in the Walker A motif.\n1.  **Biochemical Nature of the Amino Acids:** The lysine side chain ($-\\text{(CH}_2\\text{)}_4\\text{NH}_3^+$) is long, flexible, and carries a positive charge at physiological pH. The alanine side chain ($-\\text{CH}_3$) is small and non-polar.\n2.  **Interaction with ATP:** The problem explicitly states that the Walker A lysine \"stabilizes the phosphate moieties of bound nucleotides.\" ATP possesses a chain of three phosphate groups ($ \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma $), which are highly negatively charged. The positively charged lysine side chain forms a crucial electrostatic interaction (a salt bridge) with these negatively charged phosphates, neutralizing charge repulsion and stabilizing the ATP molecule in the binding pocket.\n3.  **Impact of the Lys-to-Ala Mutation on ATP Binding:** The Lys-to-Ala substitution removes this critical positive charge. The small, non-polar alanine side chain cannot provide any electrostatic stabilization for the ATP phosphates. The loss of a favorable, strong electrostatic interaction will severely weaken the binding of ATP to the NBD.\n4.  **Quantitative Effect on Binding Affinity:** In thermodynamics of binding, a weaker interaction corresponds to a less negative Gibbs free energy of binding ($\\Delta G^\\circ_{bind}$), which directly translates to a higher dissociation constant ($K_d$). The relationship is $\\Delta G^\\circ_{bind} = RT \\ln K_d$. A significant loss of a charge-charge interaction is expected to increase $K_d$ by several orders of magnitude. An increase of $10^2$-fold to $10^3$-fold ($100$ to $1000$-fold) is a conservative estimate for such a mutation.\n    -   WT $K_d \\approx 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n    -   Mutant $K_d'$ is expected to be at least $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} \\times 100 = 5000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n5.  **Effect on NBD Occupancy and Dimerization:** The problem states the experiment is run at $[\\mathrm{ATP}] = 2\\,\\mathrm{mM}$. We can calculate the fractional saturation ($\\theta$) of the ATP binding sites, $\\theta = \\frac{[\\mathrm{ATP}]}{K_d + [\\mathrm{ATP}]}$.\n    -   For WT: $\\theta_{WT} = \\frac{2000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} + 2000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{2000}{2050} \\approx 0.976$. The sites are nearly saturated.\n    -   For the Mutant (assuming $K_d' = 5\\,\\mathrm{mM}$): $\\theta_{mut} = \\frac{2\\,\\mathrm{mM}}{5\\,\\mathrm{mM} + 2\\,\\mathrm{mM}} = \\frac{2}{7} \\approx 0.286$. The sites are significantly less occupied.\n    The problem states that \"ATP-bound NBD dimerization is required for the power stroke.\" This implies that *both* NBDs must bind ATP simultaneously for the transporter to function. The probability of both sites being occupied is $\\theta^2$.\n    -   For WT: $P(\\text{dimer}) = \\theta_{WT}^2 \\approx (0.976)^2 \\approx 0.95$. The transporter is active $\\approx 95\\%$ of the time.\n    -   For the Mutant: $P(\\text{dimer}) = \\theta_{mut}^2 \\approx (0.286)^2 \\approx 0.082$. The probability of forming the active, dimerized state is less than $10\\%$. This represents a greater than $90\\%$ reduction in the concentration of the functional species.\n6.  **Predicted Phenotype:** Since the formation of the catalytically competent NBD dimer is severely impaired, the transport cycle is effectively arrested before the power stroke. The rate of substrate transport will be drastically reduced. The observed uptake of radiolabeled substrate will be minimal, close to the background level of passive diffusion across the liposome membrane, which is what would be measured in control experiments with transporter-free liposomes. A reduction in initial transport rate of more than $95\\%$ is a direct and logical consequence of the biophysical changes.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The substitution removes a critical positive charge that stabilizes the phosphate groups, increasing the ATP $K_d$ by at least $10^2$-fold and strongly disfavoring simultaneous ATP occupancy of both NBDs at $[\\mathrm{ATP}] = 2\\,\\mathrm{mM}$. NBD dimerization and the outward-open state are rarely achieved, so transport cycles collapse; the measurable phenotype is near-baseline uptake, with initial rates reduced by more than $95\\%$ and total accumulation indistinguishable from transporter-free liposomes over the same time window.**\nThis option aligns perfectly with the derivation from first principles. It correctly identifies the loss of electrostatic stabilization, the resulting drastic increase in $K_d$, the consequently low probability of NBD dimerization at the given ATP concentration, the collapse of the transport cycle, and the correctly predicted phenotype of near-zero transport activity. The quantitative estimate of $>95\\%$ reduction is consistent with our calculation showing a drop in the active state probability from $\\approx 0.95$ to $\\approx 0.08$. Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The substitution leaves ATP binding affinity essentially unchanged but specifically abolishes hydrolysis, locking the transporter in the outward-open state; the measurable phenotype is a transient “burst” of uptake followed by a high plateau that exceeds wild-type initial rates at $[\\mathrm{ATP}] = 2\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.**\nThis is incorrect. The primary role of the Walker A lysine is to coordinate the phosphates for binding. A mutation here must affect binding affinity. Stating that affinity is \"essentially unchanged\" is factually wrong. Abolishing hydrolysis while maintaining tight binding is characteristic of mutations in other motifs, such as the Walker B glutamate which acts as the catalytic base. The predicted phenotype of a single-turnover \"burst\" depends on tight binding, which this mutant lacks. Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The substitution reduces steric hindrance in the P-loop, decreasing ATP $K_d$ (higher affinity) and increasing ATPase turnover, thereby enhancing transport; the measurable phenotype is a larger initial uptake slope and a higher steady-state accumulation than wild type at $[\\mathrm{ATP}] = 2\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.**\nThis is incorrect. While alanine is smaller than lysine, this steric effect is trivial compared to the loss of the dominant, stabilizing electrostatic interaction. The premise that a key stabilizing interaction's removal would *increase* affinity (decrease $K_d$) violates fundamental principles of molecular recognition. Consequently, the prediction of enhanced transport is the opposite of what is expected. Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The substitution compromises transport only in effluxers, not importers, because binding-protein-dependent import is driven primarily by the binding protein; the measurable phenotype in the uptake assay at $[\\mathrm{ATP}] = 2\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ is unchanged relative to wild type, whereas efflux assays would show substrate accumulation inside the cell and increased drug sensitivity.**\nThis is incorrect. The ATP-binding and hydrolysis engine, comprised of the two NBDs, is the conserved motor for all ABC transporters, both importers and exporters. A crippling mutation in this motor will disable the transporter regardless of its directionality. The assertion that import is \"driven primarily by the binding protein\" is a grave misunderstanding of active transport; the binding protein only delivers the substrate, while ATP hydrolysis provides the energy for transport against a concentration gradient. Thus, the phenotype will not be unchanged.

Interpret outcomes as follows: if uptake requires ATP, is blocked by AMP-PNP, is unaffected by CCCP/valinomycin/nigericin, and is abolished in the catalytically dead mutant, conclude primary transport consistent with an ABC-type mechanism. If uptake persists without ATP, is insensitive to AMP-PNP, is abolished by CCCP and by selectively collapsing the relevant component of $\\Delta p$ (e.g., valinomycin or nigericin depending on coupling stoichiometry), and is abolished in the coupling-defective mutant, conclude secondary transport.

I will proceed to solve the problem by evaluating the proposed experimental designs in each option.\n\nThe objective is to devise a set of experiments that are both necessary and sufficient to:\n1.  **Confirm transporter-mediated transport**: This requires demonstrating saturable kinetics and competition by an unlabeled substrate, and showing that uptake is significantly lower in empty liposomes (control for passive diffusion/binding).\n2.  **Confirm active transport**: This requires demonstrating that the substrate is accumulated inside the proteoliposomes to a concentration higher than its equilibrium concentration.\n3.  **Distinguish primary vs. secondary mechanisms**:\n    *   To prove **primary active transport**, one must show a direct requirement for ATP hydrolysis. This is achieved by showing that transport is stimulated by ATP but not by a non-hydrolyzable analog like AMP-PNP. Furthermore, transport should be independent of ion gradients, meaning it is unaffected by ionophores like CCCP, valinomycin, or nigericin.\n    *   To prove **secondary active transport** (e.g., proton-coupled), one must show that transport is driven by an ion gradient. This is achieved by demonstrating that transport is abolished by reagents that dissipate the gradient (e.g., CCCP for proton motive force). It must also be shown that transport is independent of ATP hydrolysis (i.e., occurs without ATP and is insensitive to AMP-PNP), assuming an ion gradient is present.\n4.  **Confirm the role of the transporter's catalytic/coupling machinery**: The use of a catalytically dead mutant is a critical control. Abolition of transport in the mutant confirms that the proposed energy-coupling mechanism (ATP hydrolysis or ion translocation) is essential for function and that the observed transport is not an artifact.\n\nNow, I will evaluate each option based on these criteria.\n\n**Option A:** This option proposes a comprehensive set of experiments and logical interpretations.\n- **Transporter-mediation**: It correctly proposes to measure uptake across a range of substrate concentrations $[S]$ to show saturability, to use excess unlabeled $S$ to show competition, and to use empty liposomes as a control for nonspecific partitioning. This is the correct procedure.\n- **Energy source (Primary vs. Secondary)**: It correctly proposes to test for ATP-dependence (comparing with ATP vs. without ATP), ATP hydrolysis-dependence (using AMP-PNP), and ion gradient-dependence (using CCCP, valinomycin, and nigericin). This set of tests allows for unambiguous discrimination between the two mechanisms.\n- **Catalytic mechanism**: It correctly includes the use of a catalytically dead mutant as a crucial specificity control.\n- **Active Transport**: It includes a cold chase experiment to demonstrate accumulation above equilibrium, which is the definitive feature of active transport.\n- **Interpretation**: The logic presented is sound. If transport requires ATP, is blocked by AMP-PNP, is insensitive to ionophores, and is abolished by the Walker A mutant, the conclusion of primary (ABC-type) transport is strongly supported. Conversely, if transport is independent of ATP/AMP-PNP but dependent on an ion gradient (abolished by CCCP) and is abolished by the coupling-defective mutant, the conclusion of secondary transport is also strongly supported.\nThis option describes a necessary and sufficient set of experiments.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B:** This option is methodologically flawed and insufficient.\n- It proposes measuring uptake at a single substrate concentration, which cannot establish saturability, a key feature of transporter-mediated uptake.\n- It proposes using sodium azide ($5 \\ \\mathrm{mM}$) in a proteoliposome system. Sodium azide inhibits the respiratory chain to block cellular ATP synthesis. In a reconstituted system containing purified protein and supplied with an ATP regenerating system, cellular respiration does not occur, making sodium azide a nonsensical and irrelevant reagent.\n- It proposes adding CCCP and azide simultaneously, which confounds interpretation.\n- The conclusion that \"if ATP increases uptake, classify the transporter as primary\" is weak and insufficient. It fails to distinguish between a direct requirement for ATP hydrolysis and an indirect effect. It omits the crucial non-hydrolyzable ATP analog control (AMP-PNP) and the ionophore controls needed to rule out secondary transport.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C:** This option uses the wrong experimental system and flawed logic.\n- The problem specifies a system of purified transporter $T$ in proteoliposomes. This option proposes using whole cells. A whole-cell system introduces numerous confounding variables, such as other transporters for the same substrate, substrate metabolism, and complex endogenous energy generation, making it impossible to study the properties of the single purified transporter $T$ in isolation.\n- Measuring association after $10 \\ \\mathrm{min}$ is not an initial rate measurement. It is an endpoint assay that conflates uptake, efflux, and potential metabolism of the substrate. The problem correctly states that initial rates (e.g., $< 10 \\ \\mathrm{s}$) should be measured.\n- Using temperature variation ($4^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ vs $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$) is a non-specific way to probe energy dependence; many physical and enzymatic processes are temperature-dependent.\n- The logic for distinguishing mechanisms is fundamentally flawed: \"infer... based on whether CCCP or AMP-PNP has the larger effect.\" This is not a valid scientific approach. The effects should be binary and specific: a primary transporter should be insensitive to CCCP, while a secondary transporter should be insensitive to AMP-PNP. Comparing relative inhibition is unscientific and leads to ambiguity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D:** This option is incomplete and draws unsupported conclusions.\n- Measuring a linear increase for `> 5 min` is not a proper initial rate measurement for transport kinetics, which typically reach steady state or show backflux effects much sooner.\n- The use of ATP$\\gamma$S, which may be slowly hydrolyzed, can give partial activity and is less definitive than AMP-PNP, which is designed to be non-hydrolyzable and should show no activity for a primary transporter.\n- It tests only with valinomycin to rule out secondary transport. This is entirely insufficient. To rule out proton-coupled secondary transport, one must test with a protonophore like CCCP and ideally also nigericin. Valinomycin only collapses the $\\Delta \\Psi$ component of the proton motive force.\n- The explicit omission of a catalytically dead mutant and a full set of protonophores is a critical failure of experimental design. These are essential controls to make a robust conclusion. Therefore, the conclusion that $T$ is an ABC transporter is premature and not rigorously supported by the proposed experiments.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nIn summary, only Option A describes a complete and rigorous experimental plan that includes all the necessary controls to unambiguously answer the questions posed in the problem statement. The other options contain severe flaws in experimental design and logical interpretation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2468012"}]}
