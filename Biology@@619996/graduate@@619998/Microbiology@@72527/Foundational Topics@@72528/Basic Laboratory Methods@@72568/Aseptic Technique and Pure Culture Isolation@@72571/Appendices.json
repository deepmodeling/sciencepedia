All necessary information is provided to derive a unique solution based on fundamental principles of probability theory. We will proceed with the derivation as requested.\n\nLet $N$ be the random variable representing the initial number of microbial colony-forming units (CFU) per container. According to the problem statement, $N$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$. The probability mass function (PMF) of $N$ is given by:\n$$P(N=n) = \\frac{\\lambda^n \\exp(-\\lambda)}{n!} \\quad \\text{for } n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$$\n\nLet $s$ be the probability that a single organism survives the terminal heat treatment, with $0 \\le s \\le 1$. The survival of each organism is an independent event.\n\nLet $K$ be the random variable representing the number of viable organisms remaining after the treatment. Residual contamination is defined as the event that at least one viable organism remains, which corresponds to the event $\\{K \\ge 1\\}$. We are tasked with finding the probability $P(K \\ge 1)$.\n\nIt is computationally more direct to first calculate the probability of the complementary event, $\\{K = 0\\}$, which represents no residual contamination (sterility). The desired probability can then be found using the relation:\n$$P(K \\ge 1) = 1 - P(K=0)$$\n\nTo find $P(K=0)$, we will use the law of total probability, conditioning on the initial number of organisms, $N$. The sample space for $N$ is the set of non-negative integers.\n$$P(K=0) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} P(K=0 | N=n) P(N=n)$$\n\nNow, we must evaluate the conditional probability $P(K=0 | N=n)$. This is the probability that zero organisms survive, given that there were initially $n$ organisms. The probability of a single organism not surviving is $(1-s)$. Since the survival events are independent for each of the $n$ organisms, the probability that all $n$ organisms do not survive is the product of their individual probabilities of not surviving:\n$$P(K=0 | N=n) = (1-s) \\times (1-s) \\times \\dots \\times (1-s) \\quad (n \\text{ times})$$\n$$P(K=0 | N=n) = (1-s)^n$$\nNote that for the case $n=0$, this expression correctly yields $(1-s)^0 = 1$, as if there are no organisms to begin with, there will certainly be no survivors.\n\nSubstituting the conditional probability and the PMF of $N$ back into the formula for the law of total probability, we get:\n$$P(K=0) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (1-s)^n \\left( \\frac{\\lambda^n \\exp(-\\lambda)}{n!} \\right)$$\n\nWe can rearrange the terms in the summation. The term $\\exp(-\\lambda)$ is a constant with respect to the summation index $n$ and can be factored out:\n$$P(K=0) = \\exp(-\\lambda) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\lambda(1-s))^n}{n!}$$\n\nThe summation has the form of the Taylor series expansion for the exponential function, which is defined as:\n$$\\exp(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n!}$$\nIn our case, the argument $x$ is equal to $\\lambda(1-s)$. Therefore, the summation simplifies to:\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\lambda(1-s))^n}{n!} = \\exp(\\lambda(1-s))$$\n\nSubstituting this result back into our expression for $P(K=0)$:\n$$P(K=0) = \\exp(-\\lambda) \\exp(\\lambda(1-s))$$\nUsing the property of exponents $\\exp(a)\\exp(b) = \\exp(a+b)$, we combine the terms:\n$$P(K=0) = \\exp(-\\lambda + \\lambda(1-s)) = \\exp(-\\lambda + \\lambda - \\lambda s) = \\exp(-\\lambda s)$$\n\nThis expression, $P(K=0) = \\exp(-\\lambda s)$, is the probability of having no surviving organisms. The problem asks for the probability of residual contamination, $P(K \\ge 1)$.

There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of fundamental principles. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $C_i$ be the random variable representing the total number of colony-forming units (CFU) observed in sector $i$. This total is the sum of two independent components: the number of CFUs from the target organism, which we denote as $N_i'$, and the number of CFUs from environmental contamination, denoted as $N_i''$.\n$$C_i = N_i' + N_i''$$\nDue to the independence of these processes, the expectation of the total count is the sum of the individual expectations, a property known as linearity of expectation:\n$$E[C_i] = E[N_i'] + E[N_i'']$$\nWe will now derive an expression for each term.\n\nFirst, we analyze the contamination component, $N_i''$. The problem states that contamination is modeled as a homogeneous Poisson process along the streak path of length $L_i$ in sector $i$, with a rate of $\\mu$ CFUs per centimeter. For such a process, the number of events (contaminant CFUs) in an interval of length $L_i$ follows a Poisson distribution with a mean equal to the rate multiplied by the length of the interval.\nTherefore, $N_i'' \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\mu L_i)$. The expected value of a Poisson-distributed random variable is its mean parameter $\\lambda$. Thus, the expected number of contaminant CFUs in sector $i$ is:\n$$E[N_i''] = \\mu L_i$$\n\nNext, we analyze the target organism component, $N_i'$. We must determine the expected number of target CFUs in each sector.\nFor sector $i=1$, the problem states that the number of viable target cells deposited, $N_1'$, is a Poisson random variable with a mean $\\lambda_1$.\n$$N_1' \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_1)$$\nThe expected number of target CFUs in sector $1$ is therefore:\n$$E[N_1'] = \\lambda_1$$\nFor any subsequent sector $i > 1$, the target cells are transferred from the preceding sector, $i-1$. The number of cells available for transfer from sector $i-1$ is $N_{i-1}'$. Each of these cells has an independent probability $\\alpha$ of being picked up and transferred to sector $i$. This process of sampling from a Poisson-distributed population is known as \"thinning\". A fundamental property of the Poisson distribution is that if a random variable $N \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)$, and each of the $N$ individuals is independently selected with probability $p$, then the number of selected individuals, $K$, also follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda p$.\n\nApplying this property recursively:\nThe number of target cells in sector $1$ is $N_1' \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_1)$.\nThe number of target cells transferred to sector $2$, $N_2'$, is obtained by thinning the population $N_1'$ with probability $\\alpha$.

The problem is to maximize the expected number of isolated colonies, $E[N_{iso}]$, by choosing $d$. This is equivalent to choosing an optimal $\\lambda^{\\ast}$ within the given range and then calculating the corresponding $d^{\\ast}$.\n\nAccording to the provided assumptions, the colony centers form a homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP) on the circular agar plate, which we denote as the disk $S$. The area of the plate is $A = \\pi (\\frac{D_{plate}}{2})^2$. The intensity of the HPPP is $\\rho = \\frac{\\lambda}{A}$.\n\nThe non-overlap condition states that two colonies with centers $c_i$ and $c_j$ do not overlap if the distance $|c_i - c_j|$ exceeds twice their radius, $2r = D$. Therefore, a colony with center $c_i$ is considered \"isolated\" if no other colony center $c_j$ ($j \\neq i$) lies within the disk of radius $D$ centered at $c_i$. The area of this exclusion disk is $A_{ex} = \\pi D^2$.\n\nThe expected number of isolated colonies can be found using the thinning property of a Poisson process. For each point of the HPPP, we determine if it is isolated. This results in a new point process of isolated colonies. The probability that a given point is retained (i.e., is isolated) depends on its location on the plate due to edge effects. A point near the edge of the plate has a larger probability of being isolated because a portion of its exclusion disk lies outside the plate, where no other centers can exist.\n\nCalculating the exact expectation requires integrating the position-dependent isolation probability over the plate area, which is analytically intractable. However, the problem can be solved under the standard and reasonable assumption that edge effects are negligible. This assumption is justified when the exclusion radius ($D = 3.0\\,\\text{mm}$) is much smaller than the plate radius ($R_{plate} = \\frac{100}{2} = 50\\,\\text{mm}$). The ratio $\\frac{D}{R_{plate}} = \\frac{3}{50} = 0.06$, which is small.\n\nUnder the assumption of negligible edge effects, we can approximate the isolation probability as being uniform for all colonies across the plate. This probability, $p_{iso}$, is the probability that no other points of the process fall into the exclusion disk of area $A_{ex}$. For a HPPP, this void probability is given by:\n$$p_{iso} = \\exp(-\\rho A_{ex})$$\nThe process of isolated colonies is then a thinned Poisson process with a new intensity $\\rho_{iso} = \\rho \\cdot p_{iso}$. The expected number of points in this thinned process is:\n$$E[N_{iso}] = \\lambda \\cdot p_{iso} = \\lambda \\exp(-\\rho A_{ex})$$\nSubstituting $\\rho = \\frac{\\lambda}{A}$, we obtain the function to be maximized:\n$$E[N_{iso}] = f(\\lambda) = \\lambda \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda A_{ex}}{A}\\right)$$\nLet us define the dimensionless parameter $\\alpha$ as the ratio of the exclusion area to the plate area:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{A_{ex}}{A} = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{\\pi (D_{plate}/2)^2} = 4\\left(\\frac{D}{D_{plate}}\\right)^2$$\nThe function to maximize becomes:\n$$f(\\lambda) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\alpha \\lambda)$$\nTo find the maximum, we compute the derivative of $f(\\lambda)$ with respect to $\\lambda$ and set it to zero:\n$$\\frac{df}{d\\lambda} = \\frac{d}{d\\lambda} [\\lambda \\exp(-\\alpha \\lambda)] = \\exp(-\\alpha \\lambda) - \\alpha \\lambda \\exp(-\\alpha \\lambda) = (1 - \\alpha \\lambda) \\exp(-\\alpha \\lambda)$$\nSince $\\exp(-\\alpha \\lambda) > 0$, the derivative is zero when $1 - \\alpha \\lambda = 0$.
