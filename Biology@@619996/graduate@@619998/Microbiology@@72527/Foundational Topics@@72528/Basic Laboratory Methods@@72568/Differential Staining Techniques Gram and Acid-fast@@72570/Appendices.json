It is scientifically grounded in fundamental principles of acid-base equilibrium chemistry and physical chemistry of phase partitioning. It is well-posed, with all necessary data and definitions provided for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a standard, formalizable problem in chemical analysis applied to a microbiological context.\n\nWe proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we must derive the expression for the mole fraction of the protonated species, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{BH^{+}}}$. We begin with the definition of the acid dissociation constant, $K_{a}$, for the given equilibrium:\n$$\nK_{a} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}][\\mathrm{H^{+}}]}{[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}]}\n$$\nThe mole fraction of the protonated form, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{BH^{+}}}$, is defined as:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\mathrm{BH^{+}}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}]}{[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}] + [\\mathrm{B}]}\n$$\nTo express $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{BH^{+}}}$ in terms of quantities related to $\\mathrm{pH}$ and $pK_{a}$, we first rearrange the expression for $K_{a}$ to solve for the concentration of the neutral base, $[\\mathrm{B}]$:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{B}] = K_{a} \\frac{[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}]}{[\\mathrm{H^{+}}]}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[\\mathrm{B}]$ into the denominator of the equation for $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{BH^{+}}}$:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\mathrm{BH^{+}}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}]}{[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}] + K_{a} \\frac{[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}]}{[\\mathrm{H^{+}}]}}\n$$\nWe can factor out the term $[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}]$ from the denominator:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\mathrm{BH^{+}}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}]}{[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}] \\left( 1 + \\frac{K_{a}}{[\\mathrm{H^{+}}]} \\right)}\n$$\nCanceling the $[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}]$ term from the numerator and denominator yields:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\mathrm{BH^{+}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{K_{a}}{[\\mathrm{H^{+}}]}}\n$$\nThis expression relates the mole fraction to the fundamental constants $K_{a}$ and $[\\mathrm{H^{+}}]$. To obtain the final form in terms of $pK_{a}$ and $\\mathrm{pH}$, we use the provided definitions: $K_{a} = 10^{-pK_{a}}$ and $[\\mathrm{H^{+}}] = 10^{-\\mathrm{pH}}$. The ratio $\\frac{K_{a}}{[\\mathrm{H^{+}}]}$ can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\frac{K_{a}}{[\\mathrm{H^{+}}]} = \\frac{10^{-pK_{a}}}{10^{-\\mathrm{pH}}} = 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - pK_{a}}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{BH^{+}}}$ gives the final derived expression:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\mathrm{BH^{+}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - pK_{a}}}\n$$\nThis is a general form of the fractional abundance of the acidic species in a monoprotic acid-base system.\n\nNext, we evaluate $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{BH^{+}}}$ for the given values: $\\mathrm{pH} = 6.0$ and $pK_{a} = 8.0$.\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\mathrm{BH^{+}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{6.0 - 8.0}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-2.0}}\n$$\nSince $10^{-2.0} = 0.01$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\mathrm{BH^{+}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.01} = \\frac{1}{1.01}\n$$\nPerforming the division and rounding to four significant figures as required:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\mathrm{BH^{+}}} \\approx 0.990099... \\approx 0.9901\n$$\nThis result indicates that at $\\mathrm{pH} = 6.0$, approximately $99.01\\%$ of the carbolfuchsin dye exists in its protonated, cationic form, $\\mathrm{BH^{+}}$.\n\nFinally, we discuss the implication of this protonation state on the partitioning of the dye into the hydrophobic mycolic acid layers of acid-fast bacteria.\nThe fundamental principle governing the partitioning of a solute between two immiscible phases, such as a polar aqueous phase and a nonpolar lipid phase, is \"like dissolves like\". Solutes that are polar or charged have high affinity for polar solvents like water, whereas nonpolar solutes have high affinity for nonpolar environments like lipids.\n\nIn this system, we have two species of carbolfuchsin in equilibrium:\n1.  The protonated form, $\\mathrm{BH^{+}}$, is a cation. Its net positive charge makes it highly polar and hydrophilic. It will be strongly solvated by water molecules via ion-dipole interactions and will exhibit very low solubility in a nonpolar, hydrophobic medium such as the mycolic acid layer.\n2.  The neutral free base, $\\mathrm{B}$, is uncharged. While it is a complex organic molecule that may possess some polar functional groups, the absence of a net charge makes it significantly less polar and more hydrophobic compared to its conjugate acid, $\\mathrm{BH^{+}}$.\n\nTherefore, it is the neutral species, $\\mathrm{B}$, that would preferentially partition from the aqueous phase into the nonpolar, waxy mycolic acid layer of the bacterial cell envelope. The charged species, $\\mathrm{BH^{+}}$, would be strongly repelled by this hydrophobic environment and remain almost exclusively in the aqueous phase.\n\nOur calculation showed that at $\\mathrm{pH} = 6.0$, the mole fraction of the protonated species $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{BH^{+}}}$ is approximately $0.9901$. This means the mole fraction of the neutral species, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{B}} = 1 - \\alpha_{\\mathrm{BH^{+}}}$, is only about $1 - 0.9901 = 0.0099$, or less than $1\\%$. Since the concentration of the lipid-soluble species $\\mathrm{B}$ is exceedingly low at this pH, the equilibrium partitioning of carbolfuchsin into the mycolic acid layer is highly unfavorable. This analysis suggests that under these specific pH conditions, the dye would not effectively penetrate and stain the acid-fast bacteria, neglecting other factors such as the application of heat and the presence of phenol in the staining solution, which serve to increase the permeability of the cell wall.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9901}$$", "id": "2486412"}, {"introduction": "Having explored how a dye enters the cell, we now turn to quantifying its retention, the defining feature of a differential stain.

It is a standard, albeit non-trivial, problem in biophysical analysis.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe analysis begins with the Beer-Lambert law, which states that absorbance $A$ is directly proportional to the concentration $c$ of the absorbing species and the optical path length $l$. The proportionality constant is the molar absorptivity $\\varepsilon$. The decadic form is:\n$$A = \\varepsilon c l$$\nThe problem states that the measured absorbance at $590\\,\\text{nm}$ is a sum of the true absorbance from the CVI complex ($A_{\\text{CVI}}$) and an absorbance component due to elastic scattering ($A_{\\text{scat}}$). This is based on the assumption of additivity.\n$$A_{590, \\text{meas}} = A_{\\text{CVI}, 590} + A_{\\text{scat}, 590}$$\nTo isolate the true absorbance of the CVI complex, the scattering contribution must be subtracted. The problem provides a measurement at $650\\,\\text{nm}$, an off-peak wavelength where the CVI complex's absorption is negligible. This measurement is assumed to represent the scattering background. Furthermore, the scattering is assumed to be \"wavelength-flat\" in the $590$–$650\\,\\text{nm}$ range. Therefore, the scattering contribution at $590\\,\\text{nm}$ is equal to the measured absorbance at $650\\,\\text{nm}$.\n$$A_{\\text{scat}, 590} = A_{650, \\text{meas}} = 0.017$$\nWe can now calculate the corrected absorbance for the CVI complex at $590\\,\\text{nm}$.\n$$A_{\\text{CVI}, 590} = A_{590, \\text{meas}} - A_{\\text{scat}, 590} = 0.082 - 0.017 = 0.065$$\nThis corrected absorbance, $A_{\\text{CVI}, 590}$, is the value that must be used in the Beer-Lambert law. We rearrange the law to solve for the concentration, $c$.\n$$c = \\frac{A_{\\text{CVI}, 590}}{\\varepsilon_{590} \\cdot l}$$\nBefore substituting the numerical values, we must ensure consistent units.
