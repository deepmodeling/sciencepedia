An ideal, infinitesimally small point source of light in the specimen plane does not form an ideal point image. Instead, it forms a diffraction pattern known as the Point Spread Function (PSF). For a circular aperture, such as the pupil of a microscope objective, and under the assumption of no aberrations, this intensity distribution is the Airy pattern.\n\nWe begin with scalar Fraunhofer diffraction. The complex amplitude of the wavefield in the image plane is the Fourier transform of the field at the pupil of the objective lens. For an unaberrated objective, the pupil function, $P(\\mathbf{k}_{\\perp})$, can be modeled as a simple aperture that passes all spatial frequencies up to a certain cutoff, determined by the objective's numerical aperture ($\\mathrm{NA}$). In the spatial frequency domain (conjugate to the specimen's spatial coordinates $\\mathbf{r}$), this pupil function is a circ function:\n$$\nP(\\mathbf{k}_{\\perp}) =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } |\\mathbf{k}_{\\perp}| \\le k_{\\perp, \\text{max}} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } |\\mathbf{k}_{\\perp}| > k_{\\perp, \\text{max}}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{k}_{\\perp}$ is the transverse component of the wavevector. The maximum transverse wavevector, $k_{\\perp, \\text{max}}$, collected by the objective is defined by its numerical aperture, $\\mathrm{NA}$. The numerical aperture is given by $\\mathrm{NA} = n \\sin(\\theta_{\\text{max}})$, where $n$ is the refractive index of the medium between the lens and the specimen (immersion oil in this case) and $\\theta_{\\text{max}}$ is the half-angle of the cone of light collected by the objective. The magnitude of the wavevector in the medium is $k = \\frac{2\\pi n}{\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the vacuum wavelength of light.\n\nThus, the maximum spatial frequency passed by the objective is:\n$$\nk_{\\perp, \\text{max}} = k \\sin(\\theta_{\\text{max}}) = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi n}{\\lambda}\\right) \\sin(\\theta_{\\text{max}}) = \\frac{2\\pi \\mathrm{NA}}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nThe amplitude PSF, $h(\\mathbf{r})$, in the coordinate system of the specimen, is the inverse Fourier transform of the pupil function $P(\\mathbf{k}_{\\perp})$. Due to the circular symmetry, the two-dimensional Fourier transform simplifies to a zeroth-order Hankel transform:\n$$\nh(r) \\propto \\int_{0}^{k_{\\perp, \\text{max}}} J_{0}(k_{\\perp} r) k_{\\perp} \\, \\mathrm{d}k_{\\perp}\n$$\nwhere $r = |\\mathbf{r}|$ is the radial distance from the optical axis in the specimen plane and $J_0$ is the zeroth-order Bessel function of the first kind. This integral evaluates to:\n$$\nh(r) \\propto \\frac{J_{1}(k_{\\perp, \\text{max}} r)}{k_{\\perp, \\text{max}} r}\n$$\nwhere $J_1$ is the first-order Bessel function of the first kind.\n\nThe problem states that fluorescence emission is spatially incoherent. This is a critical point. For incoherent imaging, the overall intensity is the sum of the individual intensity PSFs. The intensity PSF, $I(r)$, is the squared magnitude of the amplitude PSF:\n$$\nI(r) = |h(r)|^2 \\propto \\left[ \\frac{J_{1}(k_{\\perp, \\text{max}} r)}{k_{\\perp, \\text{max}} r} \\right]^2\n$$\nThis is the mathematical description of the Airy pattern.\n\nThe Rayleigh criterion for resolution states that two identical, incoherent point sources are \"just resolved\" when the central maximum of the Airy pattern from one source is located directly over the first minimum of the Airy pattern from the other. The first minimum of the Airy pattern corresponds to the first zero of the Bessel function $J_1(x)$. From mathematical tables, the first non-trivial zero of $J_1(x)$ occurs at $x_1 \\approx 3.8317$.\n\nLet the separation distance between the two just-resolvable point sources be $d$. According to the Rayleigh criterion, this distance $d$ is equal to the radius of the first dark ring in the Airy pattern. This condition is met when the argument of the Bessel function equals $x_1$:\n$$\nk_{\\perp, \\text{max}} d = x_1 \\approx 3.8317\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $k_{\\perp, \\text{max}}$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{2\\pi \\mathrm{NA}}{\\lambda}\\right) d = 3.8317\n$$\nSolving for $d$, we obtain the expression for the Rayleigh-limited lateral resolution:\n$$\nd = \\frac{3.8317}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mathrm{NA}} \\approx 0.6098 \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mathrm{NA}}\n$$\nThis is commonly approximated as $d = 0.61 \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mathrm{NA}}$. This is the derived expression for the lateral resolution.\n\nThe minimal assumptions required for the validity of this expression are:\n1.  **Scalar Diffraction Theory Applicability**: Polarization effects are ignored. This is a significant approximation for high-$\\mathrm{NA}$ objectives ($\\mathrm{NA} > 0.7$) where vectorial effects become prominent, slightly altering the shape of the PSF.\n2.  **Aberration-Free Optics**: The objective is assumed to be perfect, with no spherical aberration, coma, astigmatism, or chromatic aberration. The problem states the objective is \"aberration-corrected,\" which justifies this idealization.\n3.  **Spatially Incoherent Emission**: The light from different points on the specimen adds in intensity, not amplitude. This is an excellent approximation for fluorescence.\n4.  **Fraunhofer (Far-Field) Diffraction**: This approximation is valid for describing the formation of the image from the pupil plane.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for the given parameters: $\\lambda = 550 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$ and $\\mathrm{NA} = 1.40$.
