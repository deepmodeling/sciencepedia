A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe objective is to determine the required molar ratio of carbon ($C$), nitrogen ($N$), phosphorus ($P$), and sulfur ($S$) in the culture medium, denoted as $C_{feed}:N_{feed}:P_{feed}:S_{feed}$. For balanced growth where the carbon source is the sole limiting nutrient at the target yield, the ratio of elements supplied in the feed must equal the ratio of elements consumed by the organism.\n\nThe stoichiometry of consumption is determined by two factors:\n$1$. The elemental composition of the biomass, given by the empirical formula $C_{1}H_{1.8}O_{0.5}N_{0.2}P_{0.02}S_{0.005}$.\n$2$. The biomass yield on the carbon substrate, $Y_{X/C}$, which specifies the fraction of consumed substrate carbon that is incorporated into new biomass.\n\nLet us establish a basis for calculation: the consumption of $1$ mole of substrate carbon.\nThe amount of carbon incorporated into biomass from this $1$ mole of substrate carbon is given by the definition of the yield coefficient:\n$$ \\text{C-moles in biomass} = Y_{X/C} \\times (\\text{C-moles of substrate consumed}) $$\n$$ \\text{C-moles in biomass} = 0.50 \\frac{\\text{C-mol biomass}}{\\text{C-mol substrate}} \\times 1 \\text{ C-mol substrate} = 0.50 \\text{ C-mol biomass} $$\n\nThis means that for every $1$ mole of carbon consumed from the substrate, $0.50$ moles of carbon are assimilated into the cellular structure. The remaining $1 - 0.50 = 0.50$ moles of carbon are catabolized, typically for energy production (respiration), and are not incorporated into biomass.\n\nNow, we use the empirical formula of the biomass, $C_{1}H_{1.8}O_{0.5}N_{0.2}P_{0.02}S_{0.005}$, to determine the corresponding molar quantities of $N$, $P$, and $S$ that must be assimilated to produce this amount of biomass. The subscripts in the formula represent the molar ratios of the elements relative to carbon *within the biomass*.\n\nThe molar ratio of nitrogen to carbon in the biomass is $\\frac{N_{biomass}}{C_{biomass}} = \\frac{0.2}{1}$.\nTherefore, the moles of nitrogen required are:\n$$ N_{consumed} = (\\text{C-moles in biomass}) \\times \\left(\\frac{N}{C}\\right)_{biomass} $$\n$$ N_{consumed} = 0.50 \\text{ C-mol} \\times \\frac{0.2 \\text{ mol } N}{1 \\text{ C-mol}} = 0.10 \\text{ mol } N $$\n\nSimilarly, for phosphorus, the molar ratio in biomass is $\\frac{P_{biomass}}{C_{biomass}} = \\frac{0.02}{1}$:\n$$ P_{consumed} = (\\text{C-moles in biomass}) \\times \\left(\\frac{P}{C}\\right)_{biomass} $$\n$$ P_{consumed} = 0.50 \\text{ C-mol} \\times \\frac{0.02 \\text{ mol } P}{1 \\text{ C-mol}} = 0.010 \\text{ mol } P $$\n\nAnd for sulfur, the molar ratio in biomass is $\\frac{S_{biomass}}{C_{biomass}} = \\frac{0.005}{1}$:\n$$ S_{consumed} = (\\text{C-moles in biomass}) \\times \\left(\\frac{S}{C}\\right)_{biomass} $$\n$$ S_{consumed} = 0.50 \\text{ C-mol} \\times \\frac{0.005 \\text{ mol } S}{1 \\text{ C-mol}} = 0.0025 \\text{ mol } S $$\n\nThese calculations establish the molar consumption ratio for the elements, based on the consumption of $1$ mole of substrate carbon:\n$$ C_{consumed} : N_{consumed} : P_{consumed} : S_{consumed} = 1 : 0.10 : 0.010 : 0.0025 $$\n\nSince the problem states that the nutrient sources for $C$, $N$, $P$, and $S$ are distinct compounds supplying only their respective elements, the required molar ratio in the feed medium must be identical to the consumption ratio to prevent premature limitation of $N$, $P$, or $S$.\n$$ C_{feed} : N_{feed} : P_{feed} : S_{feed} = 1 : 0.10 : 0.010 : 0.0025 $$\n\nFinally, the problem requires the answer to be reported to three significant figures.\n- $C$ (normalized basis): $1.00$\n- $N$: $0.100$\n- $P$: $0.0100$\n- $S$: $0.00250$\n\nThe required molar ratio in the feed is $1.00 : 0.100 : 0.0100 : 0.00250$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1.00 & 0.100 & 0.0100 & 0.00250 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2485589"}, {"introduction": "A perfectly balanced medium is useless if its chemical environment becomes hostile to growth.

The Henderson–Hasselbalch equation is valid, which presumes that activity coefficients are unity.\n$2$. The metabolic acid produced is strong and dissociates completely.\n$3$.

A buffer provides maximum buffering capacity when the solution $pH$ is equal to its $pK_a$. The initial $pH$ setpoint is $pH_0 = 7.00$. We compare the absolute difference between this target $pH$ and the $pK_a$ of each candidate buffer:\nFor MOPS: $|pK_a - pH_0| = |7.07 - 7.00| = 0.07$.\nFor Phosphate: $|pK_a - pH_0| = |7.20 - 7.00| = 0.20$.\nFor HEPES: $|pK_a - pH_0| = |7.31 - 7.00| = 0.31$.\nThe buffer with the smallest difference is MOPS.

After incubation, the tube is uniformly yellow at approximately $8$ hours, but by $24$ hours it reverts to red with a faint pink ring at the surface. The investigator suspects that fermentable amino acids in the peptone and subsequent amino acid catabolism are confounding interpretation of the carbohydrate fermentation indicator.\n\nUse the following foundational facts as your base: (i) fermentation of hexoses typically yields organic acids that donate approximately $1$ to $2$ acid equivalents per mole of hexose consumed; (ii) amino acid decarboxylation consumes a proton and yields a biogenic amine (for example, lysine to cadaverine), generating an alkaline equivalent per decarboxylation event; (iii) amino acid deamination releases ammonia, which contributes to alkalinization; (iv) many inducible amino acid decarboxylases in Enterobacteriaceae are upregulated by acidic conditions in the presence of their cognate amino acid; (v) phenol red changes from yellow to red across approximately $\\mathrm{pH}\\,6.8$ to $\\mathrm{pH}\\,8.2$; and (vi) pH changes in media follow acid–base equilibria described by the Henderson–Hasselbalch relationship.\n\nConsider an initial complex medium containing glucose at $0.5\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{L}$ (approximately $2.8\\,\\mathrm{mM}$) and peptone at $5\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{L}$, which provides a pool of free amino acids and small peptides whose decarboxylatable fraction can be crudely approximated as $50\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ potential amine precursors.

Your formulation must specify the nitrogen source, the presence or absence of complex hydrolysates, an appropriate buffer system and its target concentration range, a carbohydrate concentration, and a suitable indicator choice.\n\nWhich option best identifies the mechanism and proposes a scientifically sound formulation that minimizes decarboxylation artifacts yet remains differentially responsive to carbohydrate fermentation?\n\nA. The reversion arises because, after glucose is depleted, amino acid decarboxylases convert free amino acids to amines, consuming protons and driving the pH upward past the phenol red transition, thereby masking the earlier acidification. To minimize this, use a chemically defined medium with no complex hydrolysates, inorganic nitrogen only, and a neutral Good’s buffer: for example, $50\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS), glucose at $10\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{L}$, $(\\mathrm{NH}_4)_2\\mathrm{SO}_4$ at $2\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{L}$ as the sole nitrogen source, vitamins and trace elements, and phenol red at standard indicator concentration. This maintains sensitivity to acid while eliminating fermentable amino acids and provides sufficient buffer to resist late alkalinization.\n\nB. The late color change occurs because amino acid deamination generates strong acids that outcompete carbohydrate-derived acids. To minimize this, increase peptone to $10\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{L}$ while reducing glucose to $0.1\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{L}$ and omit buffering so that acid from amino acids can be fully expressed, then detect with phenol red.\n\nC.

The problem is free of the flaws listed in the validation criteria. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe task requires an explanation for the observed pH reversion and a proposal for a redesigned medium to prevent it.\n\n**Part (a): Analysis of the pH Reversion Mechanism**\n\n1.  **Phase I: Acidification (t < $8$ hours)**\n    *   *Enterobacteriaceae* are facultative anaerobes that preferentially metabolize glucose.\n    *   The fermentation of glucose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$) produces organic acids (e.g., lactic acid, acetic acid, formic acid).\n    *   Given the initial glucose concentration of $2.8\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ and a stoichiometry of $2$ moles of acid per mole of glucose, the total acid production potential is $2.8\\,\\mathrm{mM} \\times 2 = 5.6\\,\\mathrm{mEq}/\\mathrm{L}$.\n    *   This acid production lowers the pH of the weakly buffered medium. The observation of a uniformly yellow tube at $8$ hours confirms that the pH has dropped below $6.8$.\n\n2.  **Phase II: Alkalinization (t > $8$ hours)**\n    *   The low concentration of glucose ($0.5\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{L}$) is rapidly exhausted.\n    *   With the primary carbohydrate source depleted, the bacteria switch to catabolizing components of the peptone, namely amino acids, for energy and carbon.\n    *   Two primary alkalinizing processes occur:\n        *   **Amino Acid Decarboxylation**: As per Fact (iv), the acidic environment created in Phase I induces the synthesis of amino acid decarboxylase enzymes. These enzymes, as per Fact (ii), remove the carboxyl group from amino acids (e.g., lysine $\\rightarrow$ cadaverine), a reaction that consumes a proton from the medium: $\\mathrm{R-CH(NH_3^+)-COO^- + H^+ \\rightarrow R-CH_2-NH_3^+ + CO_2}$. This directly neutralizes the acid produced earlier. Given the large pool of available precursors ($ \\approx 50\\,\\mathrm{mM}$), the potential for alkalinization ($50\\,\\mathrm{mEq}/\\mathrm{L}$) far exceeds the acid produced from glucose ($5.6\\,\\mathrm{mEq}/\\mathrm{L}$).\n        *   **Amino Acid Deamination**: This process removes the amino group from an amino acid, releasing ammonia ($NH_3$). As per Fact (iii), ammonia is a weak base that dissolves in water to form ammonium and hydroxide ions ($NH_3 + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons NH_4^+ + OH^-$), raising the pH. Oxidative deamination requires oxygen and is thus most prominent at the surface of the broth, which explains the \"faint pink ring\" ($\\mathrm{pH} > 8.2$).\n    *   The combined effect of these processes is the consumption of protons and production of base, causing the pH to rise back above $6.8$, leading to the observed color reversion from yellow to red.\n\n**Part (b): Redesign of the Medium**\n\nTo prevent this artifact, the new medium must (1) eliminate the source of alkaline reversion and (2) ensure the acidic signal from carbohydrate fermentation is clear and stable.\n\n1.  **Eliminate the Confounding Substrate**: The peptone is the source of the amino acids causing the reversion. It must be removed. This necessitates creating a **chemically defined medium**.\n2.  **Provide a Non-Confounding Nitrogen Source**: The bacteria still require nitrogen for growth. An inorganic nitrogen salt, such as ammonium sulfate (($\\mathrm{NH}_4)_2\\mathrm{SO}_4$) or ammonium chloride ($NH_4Cl$), provides nitrogen in a form that cannot be catabolized to produce alkaline products.\n3.  **Increase Carbohydrate Concentration**: The low glucose concentration ($0.5\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{L}$) is the reason it is depleted quickly, allowing reversion to occur. Increasing the glucose concentration to a standard level for fermentation tests, such as $5-10\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{L}$ ($1\\%$), ensures a prolonged and substantial production of acid that will maintain a low pH.\n4.  **Optimize Buffering**: The original medium is weakly buffered, allowing large pH swings. A new formulation should include a non-metabolizable buffer (e.g., a Good's buffer like MOPS or PIPES) at a moderate concentration (e.g., $20-50\\,\\mathrm{mM}$). This buffer should be strong enough to prevent spurious pH drift but not so strong as to mask the initial acidification from glucose fermentation.\n5.  **Indicator**: Phenol red remains a suitable indicator for detecting a pH drop from neutrality.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. The reversion arises because, after glucose is depleted, amino acid decarboxylases convert free amino acids to amines, consuming protons and driving the pH upward past the phenol red transition...

This formulation effectively solves the problem.\n    *   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. The late color change occurs because amino acid deamination generates strong acids... To minimize this, increase peptone to $10\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{L}$ while reducing glucose to $0.1\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{L}$...**\n    *   The premise that deamination generates acid is fundamentally incorrect. Deamination produces ammonia, a base.\n    *   The proposed solution—increasing peptone and decreasing glucose—would exacerbate, not mitigate, the problem of alkaline reversion.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. The color reversion is primarily due to redox interference by peptone components rather than pH... swap phenol red for methyl red, raise the initial medium to $\\mathrm{pH}\\,5.2$...**\n    *   The claim of \"redox interference\" is unsubstantiated and contradicts the classic, well-understood pH-based mechanism. The problem is explicitly framed around acid-base chemistry.\n    *   The proposed solution of including more complex hydrolysates (casamino acids) would worsen the problem. Switching indicators and pH does not address the root cause.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. The late alkalinization reflects Stickland-type amino acid fermentations; the best countermeasure is to overpower it with high-capacity phosphate buffering... at $200\\,\\mathrm{mM}$...**\n    *   The attribution to Stickland reactions is likely incorrect, as these are characteristic of obligate anaerobes like *Clostridium*, not facultative anaerobes like *Enterobacteriaceae*.\n    *   The proposed solution of using an extremely high buffer concentration ($200\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ phosphate) would completely mask the acidification from the small amount of glucose ($0.5\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{L}$), rendering the test insensitive and useless. A test must be responsive to the change it is designed to detect.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on this analysis, Option A provides both the correct scientific explanation and the most appropriate and effective solution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2485638"}]}
