It provides a realistic scenario in structural biology and protein engineering. All provided data and principles are consistent with established knowledge in biochemistry. The constraints are clearly defined. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe goal is to increase thermostability. According to the provided principles, this can be achieved by:\n1.  Increasing favorable enthalpy ($\\Delta H < 0$): adding or strengthening bonds (hydrogen bonds, salt bridges) or improving packing interactions.\n2.  Decreasing the entropy of the unfolded state ($\\Delta S_\\mathrm{unfolding}$): reducing the conformational flexibility of the polypeptide chain, particularly in loops, by introducing conformationally restricted residues like proline or by removing long, flexible side chains from solvent-exposed surfaces.\n\nWe will now analyze each proposed set of mutations.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThis option proposes three mutations: `L3 K82A, Q83A, S85P`; `E210D`; and `S155V`.\n1.  `L3 K82A, Q83A, S85P`: L3 is a highly flexible, solvent-exposed loop. Mutating the long, flexible side chains of Lysine (K) and Glutamine (Q) to Alanine (A) is a standard \"surface entropy reduction\" strategy. It reduces the conformational entropy of the unfolded state, which can increase thermostability. Introducing Proline (P) into a loop rigidifies the backbone. Since L3 is not involved in lattice contacts, these mutations are unlikely to disrupt the assembly. This part of the proposal is sound.\n2.  `E210D` at Interface I: Glu$210$ is part of a critical $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ chelation site with octahedral geometry. The side chain of Glutamate (E) is one methylene group longer than that of Aspartate (D). The mutation `E210D` shortens this chelating side chain, which would alter the bond lengths and angles of the coordination sphere. This is almost certain to disrupt the precise octahedral geometry required to bind the $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ion, which is stated to be \"critical for lattice integrity.\" This modification would likely destabilize or destroy the lattice.\n3.  `S155V` in the core: Ser$155$ is in the hydrophobic core and forms a hydrogen bond with a backbone carbonyl. The `S155V` mutation replaces a polar residue with a non-polar one. This has two immediate consequences: it breaks the existing hydrogen bond (an enthalpic penalty), and it introduces a bulkier side chain which may cause steric clashes. While improving core hydrophobicity is a valid strategy, it is not guaranteed to be stabilizing here, especially given the loss of a specific, stabilizing hydrogen bond.\nThe `E210D` mutation is severely flawed and would likely be highly destabilizing. This outweighs any potential benefits from the other mutations. Thus, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\nThis option proposes two modifications: `Introduce C120 and C345`; and `T230A, N231A`.\n1.  Introduce `C120` and `C345` for an inter-monomer disulfide: The problem states the $C\\beta$–$C\\beta$ distance between these positions is $9.0\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$. The principle provided for disulfide bond formation states the required distance is $3.5$–$4.5\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$. A distance of $9.0\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$ is far too great. Forming a disulfide bond would require a massive and disruptive structural rearrangement, which would violate the constraint to preserve the $p6$ lattice. This proposal is sterically impossible without destroying the native structure.\n2.  `T230A, N231A` at Interface II: The rationale is to \"reduce surface entropy.\" However, the problem states these residues mediate \"buried hydrogen bonds\". Removing these hydrogen bonds by mutating to Alanine (A) would result in a significant loss of favorable enthalpy at a buried interface, which would destabilize the assembly. The concept of surface entropy reduction applies to flexible, solvent-exposed side chains, not to structured residues forming specific bonds at a buried interface.\nBoth proposed changes are based on faulty reasoning and would be detrimental to stability. Thus, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThis option proposes two sets of mutations: `L290E, V294K`; and `K82D, Q83E`.\n1.  `L290E, V294K` at Interface II: The problem explicitly states that residues $290$–$296$ define the central pore. One of the main constraints is to preserve pore dimensions. The mutations `L290E` and `V294K` introduce long, charged side chains into the pore-lining region. This directly violates the problem's constraint. Furthermore, Interface II is described as hydrophobic (\"aromatic and aliphatic packing\"). Introducing charges into a hydrophobic environment is generally highly destabilizing.\n2.  `K82D, Q83E` in Loop L3: The rationale is to \"reduce flexibility.\" It is not clear why introducing two negatively charged residues would reduce the flexibility of a loop that already contains charges. This might create new intra-loop salt bridges, but could also cause electrostatic repulsion. This is not a standard or reliable method for rigidifying a loop, unlike proline substitution.\nThe modifications to the pore are a direct violation of the problem's explicit constraints. Thus, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThis option proposes three mutations: `G201P`; `K145R`; and `F223Y`.\nThe option correctly states that these mutations do not affect the pore ($290$–$296$) or the glycosylation site ($N62$).\n1.  `G201P` in L6: Gly$201$ is at the center of a tight type I’ turn. Glycine is flexible. Proline is rigid and its $\\phi$ dihedral angle is restricted to values typical for turns. Replacing Glycine with Proline in a turn is a classic and effective strategy to decrease the conformational entropy of the unfolded state, thereby increasing thermostability. The entropic penalty for folding is reduced. This is a sound design choice.\n2.  `K145R` at Interface I: The existing Lys$145$–Asp$220$ interaction is weak, with a long distance of $4.7\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$. The `K145R` mutation replaces Lysine with Arginine. Arginine's planar guanidinium group is capable of forming a stronger, bidentate salt bridge with the carboxylate of Aspartate. The stated resulting N–O distance of $\\approx 2.8$–$3.0\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$ is ideal for strong hydrogen bonds/salt bridges. This change significantly improves the enthalpic contribution to the interface stability.\n3.  `F223Y` at Interface II: The wild-type Phe$223$ pair has a weak $\\pi$-stacking interaction (separation $5.2\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$). The mutation `F223Y` replaces Phenylalanine with Tyrosine. Tyrosine can still participate in $\\pi$-stacking. Crucially, its hydroxyl group can form a new hydrogen bond with the nearby Asp$225$, which currently does not form any hydrogen bond. The predicted H-bond distance of $\\approx 2.9\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$ is optimal. This modification cleverly introduces a favorable enthalpic interaction without disrupting the hydrophobic nature of the interface.\nAll three mutations are based on sound, well-established principles of protein stabilization. They either decrease the entropic cost of folding (`G201P`) or increase favorable enthalpic interactions (`K145R`, `F223Y`). They are all small, local changes that are expected to preserve the overall fold and lattice symmetry. This option is a coherent and potent strategy for thermostabilization that respects all given constraints. Thus, this option is **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2473911"}, {"introduction": "Having considered the properties of individual monomers, we now scale up to the entire cell envelope.

The provided dimensions for the cell radius ($r = 0.6\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) and the S-layer lattice constant ($a = 18\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) are consistent with experimentally observed values. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient information to derive a unique estimate. The language is objective and precise.

These are standard simplifications for such estimations. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Solution Derivation**\nThe problem requires an estimation of the total number of protein subunits, $N$, needed to tile the surface of a spherical cell. This is achieved by dividing the total surface area of the cell, $A_{\\text{cell}}$, by the effective area occupied by a single subunit, $A_{\\text{subunit}}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the surface area of the archaeal cell. Approximating the cell as a sphere with radius $r$, the surface area is given by the formula:\n$$A_{\\text{cell}} = 4\\pi r^2$$\n\nNext, we must determine the area occupied by a single protein subunit. The subunits are arranged in a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice with a lattice constant $a$, which is the distance between the centers of adjacent subunits. A hexagonal lattice can be tiled by primitive unit cells, each containing one lattice point. The conventional primitive unit cell is a rhombus composed of two equilateral triangles with side length $a$.\n\nThe area of an equilateral triangle with side length $a$ is:\n$$A_{\\text{triangle}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} a^2$$\n\nThe area of the rhombic primitive unit cell, which we take as the area per lattice point (and thus per subunit, as per the problem statement), is twice the area of one such triangle:\n$$A_{\\text{subunit}} = 2 \\times A_{\\text{triangle}} = 2 \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} a^2 \\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} a^2$$\nThe problem's assumption of \"local planarity\" justifies using this planar area calculation for a small patch of the cell's curved surface.\n\nThe total number of subunits, $N$, is the ratio of the total cell surface area to the area per subunit:\n$$N = \\frac{A_{\\text{cell}}}{A_{\\text{subunit}}} = \\frac{4\\pi r^2}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} a^2} = \\frac{8\\pi r^2}{\\sqrt{3} a^2}$$\n\nBefore substituting the numerical values, we must ensure consistent units.
