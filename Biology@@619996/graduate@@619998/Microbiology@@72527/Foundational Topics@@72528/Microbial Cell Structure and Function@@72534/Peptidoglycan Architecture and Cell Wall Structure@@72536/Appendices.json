The structure allows for a unique and meaningful solution. It is valid.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. It is free of subjectivity. It is valid.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. It is therefore deemed valid. A solution will be derived from first principles as requested.\n\nThe translocation of lipid II between the inner and outer leaflets can be represented by a minimal, reversible kinetic scheme:\n$$ L_i \\underset{k_r}{\\stackrel{k_f}{\\rightleftharpoons}} L_o $$\nHere, $L_i$ represents lipid II on the inner leaflet and $L_o$ represents lipid II on the outer leaflet. The forward reaction from inner to outer proceeds with rate constant $k_f$, and the reverse reaction from outer to inner proceeds with rate constant $k_r$.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the rate of a reaction is proportional to the product of the concentrations (or, in this context, amounts) of the reactants. The rates of change of the amounts of $L_i$ and $L_o$ are described by a system of ordinary differential equations.\n\nThe rate of change of the amount of lipid II on the outer leaflet, $\\frac{dL_o}{dt}$, is given by the rate of its formation from $L_i$ minus the rate of its consumption to form $L_i$.\n$$ \\frac{dL_o}{dt} = k_f L_i(t) - k_r L_o(t) $$\nSimilarly, the rate of change of the amount of lipid II on the inner leaflet, $\\frac{dL_i}{dt}$, is:\n$$ \\frac{dL_i}{dt} = k_r L_o(t) - k_f L_i(t) $$\nIt is noted that $\\frac{dL_i}{dt} + \\frac{dL_o}{dt} = 0$, which is consistent with the given conservation constraint, $L_i(t) + L_o(t) = L_{\\text{tot}}$, upon differentiation with respect to time.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the steady-state proportion. The fundamental definition of a steady state is the condition where the net rates of change of all species are zero. We denote the steady-state amounts by $L_i^{\\ast}$ and $L_o^{\\ast}$. Applying this condition to the differential equation for $L_o(t)$:\n$$ \\left. \\frac{dL_o}{dt} \\right|_{\\text{steady state}} = 0 $$\n$$ k_f L_i^{\\ast} - k_r L_o^{\\ast} = 0 $$\nThis yields a key relationship between the steady-state amounts:\n$$ k_f L_i^{\\ast} = k_r L_o^{\\ast} $$\nThis equation expresses the principle of detailed balance at steady state: the forward flux equals the reverse flux.\n\nWe now have a system of two algebraic equations with two unknowns, $L_i^{\\ast}$ and $L_o^{\\ast}$:\n1.  The steady-state condition: $k_f L_i^{\\ast} = k_r L_o^{\\ast}$\n2.  The conservation law at steady state: $L_i^{\\ast} + L_o^{\\ast} = L_{\\text{tot}}$\n\nThe objective is to find an expression for $p_o^{\\ast} = L_o^{\\ast}/L_{\\text{tot}}$. We must solve this system for $L_o^{\\ast}$ in terms of $k_f$, $k_r$, and $L_{\\text{tot}}$. From the conservation law (equation 2), we express $L_i^{\\ast}$ in terms of $L_o^{\\ast}$ and $L_{\\text{tot}}$:\n$$ L_i^{\\ast} = L_{\\text{tot}} - L_o^{\\ast} $$\nNext, we substitute this expression for $L_i^{\\ast}$ into the steady-state equation (equation 1):\n$$ k_f (L_{\\text{tot}} - L_o^{\\ast}) = k_r L_o^{\\ast} $$\nWe now solve this equation for $L_o^{\\ast}$. First, distribute the term $k_f$:\n$$ k_f L_{\\text{tot}} - k_f L_o^{\\ast} = k_r L_o^{\\ast} $$\nRearrange the equation to isolate terms involving $L_o^{\\ast}$:\n$$ k_f L_{\\text{tot}} = k_f L_o^{\\ast} + k_r L_o^{\\ast} $$\nFactor out $L_o^{\\ast}$:\n$$ k_f L_{\\text{tot}} = (k_f + k_r) L_o^{\\ast} $$\nFinally, solve for $L_o^{\\ast}$:\n$$ L_o^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_f}{k_f + k_r} L_{\\text{tot}} $$\nThe problem asks for the steady-state proportion of lipid II on the outer leaflet, $p_o^{\\ast} = L_o^{\\ast}/L_{\\text{tot}}$.

The described experiment is a standard approach in the field. The formation of 1,6-anhydromuramyl termini by lytic transglycosylases is a fundamental, established biochemical fact.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides a clear cause (enzyme deletion) and a quantifiable effect (doubled glycan chain length). It asks for a logical inference based on this cause-and-effect relationship, which is a well-posed task.\n-   **Consistency and Completeness**: The information is internally consistent. The deletion of a chain-cleaving enzyme (a lytic transglycosylase) is expected to result in longer chains, which aligns perfectly with the observation that the average chain length doubles from $20$ to $40$. All necessary information to deduce the answer from first principles is provided.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed to derive a solution.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires an inference based on the fundamental definitions of the involved enzymes and peptidoglycan structure.\n\n1.  **Function of a Lytic Transglycosylase (LT)**: By definition, a lytic transglycosylase is an enzyme that cleaves the $\\beta(1\\to4)$-glycosidic bond between an $N$-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) residue and an $N$-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue within a peptidoglycan glycan strand. This is an endolytic activity. The reaction mechanism is a transglycosylation, wherein the C$6$-hydroxyl group of the MurNAc residue at the cleavage site attacks the anomeric center (C$1$), forming a stable internal $1,6$-anhydro bond on that MurNAc residue. This action simultaneously cleaves the glycan chain and creates a new chain terminus characterized by a $1,6$-anhydromuramyl residue. Therefore, the normal physiological role of LTs is to cut PG strands, which is essential for processes like cell wall turnover, expansion, and daughter cell separation.\n\n2.  **Interpretation of the Mutant Phenotype**: The problem states that deleting a single LT gene causes the average glycan chain length to double, from $\\approx 20$ units to $\\approx 40$ units. This experimental result is the direct and expected consequence of removing an enzyme whose function is to cut the chains. With fewer enzymatic \"scissors\" active, the chains polymerize to a greater length before a termination event occurs. This confirms that the normal role of the deleted enzyme is indeed the endolytic cleavage of glycan strands.\n\n3.  **Prediction of the Muropeptide Profile Change**: The muropeptide profile is generated by digesting the entire sacculus with a muramidase. A muramidase is a hydrolase, cleaving $\\beta(1\\to4)$-glycosidic bonds by adding water, which generates a standard linear MurNAc structure at the newly formed reducing end. It is critical to distinguish between termini generated *in vivo* by the cell's own enzymes and those generated *in vitro* by the experimental digestion.\n    -   The $1,6$-anhydromuramyl termini are the chemical fingerprints of *in vivo* lytic transglycosylase activity. They existed in the sacculus before the muramidase was added. The abundance of these termini is a direct measure of how many glycan strands were terminated by an LT.\n    -   In the wild-type bacterium, a population of LTs, including the one that is later deleted, creates a baseline number of $1,6$-anhydromuramyl-terminated strands. This corresponds to a certain proportion of 1,6-anhydromuropeptides in the HPLC profile.\n    -   In the mutant, one of these LTs is absent. The direct consequence, as observed, is longer chains. Longer chains mean there are fewer chains, and thus fewer chain termini, for a given total mass of peptidoglycan. Since LTs are responsible for creating $1,6$-anhydromuramyl termini, the deletion of an LT must lead to a *reduction* in the total number of such termini generated *in vivo*.\n    -   Therefore, the muropeptide profile of the mutant, when compared to the wild type, will exhibit a **decreased** proportion of muropeptides that bear a $1,6$-anhydromuramyl terminus.\n    -   Regarding peptide crosslinking, the deleted enzyme is a transglycosylase, which acts on the glycan backbone. While complex regulation can link glycan and peptide metabolism, the most direct and primary effect is on glycan length. The information that the growth rate is unchanged suggests that the overall structural integrity of the sacculus is not compromised, making it reasonable to infer that the peptide crosslinking index remains approximately constant.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The deleted enzyme normally performs endolytic cleavage of $\\beta(1\\to4)$ linkages between $N$-acetylmuramic acid and $N$-acetylglucosamine as a lytic transglycosylase, generating 1,6-anhydromuramyl ends that terminate glycan strands; its deletion reduces the frequency of such termini, yielding longer average glycan chains and a decreased proportion of 1,6-anhydromuropeptides, with the overall peptide crosslinking index remaining approximately unchanged.**\n-   **Analysis**: This statement is entirely correct. It accurately describes the function of a lytic transglycosylase, correctly connects its deletion to the observed longer glycan chains, correctly predicts a decrease in the specific chemical signature of LT activity (1,6-anhydromuropeptides), and makes a sound inference regarding the crosslinking index.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The deleted enzyme is a peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase (a Penicillin-Binding Protein, PBP) that polymerizes glycan chains; its deletion should shorten glycan chains and increase the proportion of 1,6-anhydromuropeptides due to compensatory autolysis.**\n-   **Analysis**: This statement misidentifies the enzyme class. A glycosyltransferase *synthesizes* chains, so its deletion would lead to *shorter* chains, which contradicts the problem's data (chain length doubled). The premise is fundamentally flawed.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The deleted enzyme is an $N$-acetylmuramyl-$L$-alanine amidase that trims stem peptides from glycan backbones; its deletion should not affect glycan chain length but would increase 1,6-anhydromuropeptides by blocking peptide removal.**\n-   **Analysis**: This statement misidentifies the enzyme class. An amidase acts on the peptide stem, not the glycan backbone. Its deletion would not have a primary effect on glycan chain length, again contradicting the problem's data.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The deleted enzyme is a D,D-carboxypeptidase that converts pentapeptides to tetrapeptides; its deletion should increase the glycan chain length by $2$-fold and increase 1,6-anhydromuropeptides through enhanced glycan scission.**\n-   **Analysis**: This statement misidentifies the enzyme class. A carboxypeptidase acts on the peptide stem to regulate crosslinking. There is no direct mechanism by which its deletion would double glycan chain length. The prediction that it would *increase* 1,6-anhydromuropeptides is the opposite of the logical conclusion derived from the data.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2518904"}, {"introduction": "The essential nature of peptidoglycan synthesis makes it an ideal target for antibiotics.

The breakdown of this complex is a unimolecular, first-order process governed by the rate constant $k_{deacyl}$. The rate of change of the concentration of the complex, $[E_{acyl}]$, is described by the first-order rate law:\n$$\n\\frac{d[E_{acyl}]}{dt} = -k_{deacyl} [E_{acyl}]\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation.

It is the negative derivative of the survival function:\n$$\np(t) = -\\frac{dS(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\exp(-k_{deacyl} t)\\right) = k_{deacyl} \\exp(-k_{deacyl} t)\n$$\nThe mean residence time, $\\tau$, is the expectation value of the lifetime $t$.

This wall is continuously synthesized and remodeled, particularly in actively growing and dividing cells. The final and critical step of this synthesis is the cross-linking of peptide side chains, a reaction catalyzed by transpeptidases, which are Penicillin-Binding Proteins (PBPs).\n\nThe provided kinetic parameters describe an extremely efficient inhibitor. The acylation rate constant, $k_{acyl} = 10^{4} \\ \\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}$, is high, indicating that the PBP is rapidly captured and inactivated by the antibiotic. More importantly, the deacylation rate constant, $k_{deacyl} = 10^{-6} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$, is exceptionally small. This corresponds to a mean residence time of the inactive acyl-enzyme complex of $\\tau = 10^6 \\ \\text{s}$. This time is equivalent to approximately $278$ hours or $11.6$ days.\n\nThe generation time for a typical bacterium like *Escherichia coli* under favorable conditions is on the order of $20-30$ minutes (approximately $1200 - 1800 \\ \\text{s}$). The lifetime of the inhibited enzyme complex ($10^6 \\ \\text{s}$) is orders of magnitude longer than the bacterial cell division cycle. Consequently, once a PBP molecule is acylated by the antibiotic, it is effectively permanently sequestered and removed from the functional pool of enzymes for many generations.\n\nIn an actively growing bacterium, the near-irreversible inhibition of a significant fraction of its PBPs halts peptidoglycan cross-linking. The cell continues to grow but cannot synthesize a mechanically stable cell wall. The resulting defective wall cannot withstand the cell's internal turgor pressure, leading to catastrophic failure of the cell envelope, lysis, and death. This mechanism is inherently lethal, thus the outcome is bactericidal, not merely bacteriostatic (growth-inhibiting).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.00 \\times 10^6}\n$$", "id": "2518928"}]}
