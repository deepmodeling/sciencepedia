Both WTA and LTA are polyanionic due to repeating phosphate groups; D-alanyl transfer (Dlt) enzymes esterify a subset of these phosphates with D-alanine, introducing cationic character that reduces net anionic charge density. You measure the electrophoretic $\\zeta$-potential of mid-exponential cells suspended at pH $7.4$ in a buffered electrolyte containing $10$ mM sodium chloride and $1$ mM magnesium chloride. The wild type exhibits $\\zeta = -35$ mV, whereas an isogenic $\\mathit{dlt}$-deficient mutant exhibits $\\zeta = -15$ mV under identical conditions.\n\nStarting from the following foundational bases: (i) the chemical structure and topological organization of WTA and LTA, (ii) the effect of D-alanylation on the net charge of teichoic acid phosphodiester backbones, and (iii) the electrokinetic definition that the $\\zeta$-potential reflects the electrostatic potential at the hydrodynamic shear plane within the diffuse layer governed by ion screening and specific counterion binding, choose the option that most consistently attributes the relative contributions of WTA and LTA to the measured surface charge and provides a mechanistic explanation for the observed direction of the $\\zeta$-potential change in the $\\mathit{dlt}$ mutant.\n\nA. WTA are the dominant contributors to the measured surface charge because their phosphate-rich backbones are densely displayed in the outer cell wall, whereas LTA are partially embedded and less exposed. Loss of D-alanylation in the $\\mathit{dlt}$ mutant increases the bare anionic charge density on both WTA and LTA, which, in the presence of divalent cations, enhances specific counterion condensation and screening at phosphate sites. This reduces the electrostatic potential at the shear plane and thus yields a less negative measured $\\zeta$-potential despite a more negative chemical surface, reconciling $\\zeta = -15$ mV in the mutant versus $\\zeta = -35$ mV in wild type.\n\nB. LTA are the dominant contributors to the measured surface charge because they extend furthest into the extracellular space, and the loss of D-alanylation in the $\\mathit{dlt}$ mutant decreases the anionic charge of LTA, directly causing the less negative $\\zeta$-potential.\n\nC. WTA contribute more to surface charge than LTA, but the less negative $\\zeta$-potential of the $\\mathit{dlt}$ mutant necessarily implies that WTA abundance is greatly reduced below wild-type levels due to envelope stress, and therefore the measured change must be attributed primarily to decreased WTA concentration rather than to electrostatic screening phenomena.\n\nD. The data are inconsistent with electrokinetic theory because increasing anionic charge density can never lead to a less negative $\\zeta$-potential; the only plausible explanation is measurement error, so no inference about WTA or LTA contributions can be made.", "solution": "The validity of the problem statement is established as follows.\n**Givens:**\n1.  **System:** A Gram-positive coccus.\n2.  **Cell Wall Components:** Wall Teichoic Acid (WTA) linked to peptidoglycan; Lipoteichoic Acid (LTA) anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane.\n3.  **Chemical Properties:** Both WTA and LTA are polyanionic due to repeating phosphate groups.\n4.  **Modification:** D-alanyl transfer (Dlt) enzymes esterify phosphate groups with D-alanine, adding cationic character.\n5.  **Strains:** Wild type (expresses Dlt) and an isogenic $\\mathit{dlt}$-deficient mutant.\n6.  **Measurement:** Electrophoretic $\\zeta$-potential.\n7.  **Conditions:** Suspension in a buffer at pH $7.4$ containing $10$ mM sodium chloride (NaCl) and $1$ mM magnesium chloride (MgCl$_2$).\n8.  **Data:** $\\zeta_{\\text{wild type}} = -35$ mV; $\\zeta_{\\mathit{dlt}\\text{-mutant}} = -15$ mV.\n9.  **Theoretical Basis:** The solution must be based on (i) WTA/LTA structure/location, (ii) the effect of D-alanylation, and (iii) the electrokinetic definition of $\\zeta$-potential.\n\n**Validation:**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound and well-posed. The description of teichoic acids, their D-alanylation, and their role in determining the surface charge of Gram-positive bacteria is consistent with established principles of microbiology. The experimental data present a classic, albeit counter-intuitive, phenomenon in bacterial surface electrochemistry. The apparent paradoxâ€”that a cell surface with a higher intrinsic negative charge density exhibits a less negative $\\zeta$-potentialâ€”is not a flaw in the problem but is the central point to be explained. This phenomenon is well-documented and can be explained by the theory of the electrical double layer, particularly the effects of counterion condensation. The problem is therefore valid and solvable.\n\n**Derivation of Solution:**\n\nThe problem requires an explanation for why a $\\mathit{dlt}$-deficient mutant, which has a chemically more negative surface, exhibits a *less* negative $\\zeta$-potential compared to the wild type.\n\n1.  **Surface Chemistry:**\n    *   Teichoic acids (both WTA and LTA) possess a polyanionic backbone due to repeating phosphodiester groups ($-\\text{PO}_4^-$).\n    *   In the wild type, Dlt enzymes esterify some of these phosphate groups with D-alanine. At pH $7.4$, the carboxyl group of D-alanine is esterified, leaving its amino group free. This amino group is protonated ($-\\text{NH}_3^+$), thus introducing positive charges onto the polymer.\n    *   Therefore, the net negative charge density on the teichoic acids of the wild-type strain is partially reduced.\n    *   In the $\\mathit{dlt}$-deficient mutant, this modification is absent. The teichoic acid backbone retains its full complement of negative charges from the phosphate groups.\n    *   Conclusion: The intrinsic chemical surface charge density, $\\sigma_0$, of the mutant is significantly more negative than that of the wild type: $\\sigma_{0, \\text{mutant}} < \\sigma_{0, \\text{WT}} < 0$.\n\n2.  **Electrokinetic Principles and $\\zeta$-Potential:**\n    *   The $\\zeta$-potential is the electrostatic potential at the hydrodynamic plane of shear. This is an imaginary surface that separates the layer of ions and solvent that moves with the particle from the bulk solvent.\n    *   A charged surface in an electrolyte solution is surrounded by an electrical double layer, consisting of a layer of counterions strongly associated with the surface (the Stern layer) and a more diffuse layer of ions extending into the bulk solution (the Gouy-Chapman layer).\n    *   The potential decays from the surface value ($\\psi_0$) through the double layer to zero in the bulk. The $\\zeta$-potential is the value of this potential at the shear plane, which is typically located near the boundary between the Stern and diffuse layers.\n    *   The presence of divalent cations, such as $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ (at $1$ mM concentration), is critical. These ions are much more effective at screening and binding to negative charges than monovalent cations like $\\text{Na}^+$ (at $10$ mM).\n\n3.  **Reconciling the Apparent Paradox:**\n    *   The mutant surface has a very high density of negative charges. According to polyelectrolyte theory, such a high linear charge density leads to strong \"counterion condensation.\" The divalent $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ ions will be very strongly attracted to the closely spaced phosphate groups on the mutant's teichoic acids.\n    *   This results in a dense layer of condensed $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ ions tightly bound within the Stern layer. This binding effectively neutralizes a large fraction of the surface chemical charge.\n    *   Consequently, the electrostatic potential drops very sharply close to the surface. The shear plane is located outside this region of strong condensation. The potential at this plane, the $\\zeta$-potential, is therefore of a smaller magnitude (i.e., less negative). So, $\\zeta_{\\text{mutant}} = -15$ mV.\n    *   The wild-type surface has a lower negative charge density due to D-alanylation. The attraction for $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ is weaker, and counterion condensation is less pronounced. The potential decays more gradually away from the surface. The shear plane therefore exists in a region where the potential is more negative, leading to the measured value of $\\zeta_{\\text{WT}} = -35$ mV.\n    *   This effect explains how a more negative chemical surface can result in a less negative electrokinetic potential.\n\n4.  **Relative Contributions of WTA and LTA:**\n    *   WTA is covalently anchored throughout the thick peptidoglycan layer, forming a dense, external matrix. LTA is anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane and threads through the peptidoglycan. In most Gram-positive bacteria, the sheer abundance and external location of WTA make it the dominant contributor to the properties of the cell wall's outer surface and thus to the measured $\\zeta$-potential.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   **A.** This option correctly states that WTA are the dominant contributors due to their dense display in the outer cell wall. It correctly identifies that the loss of D-alanylation increases the anionic charge density. Most importantly, it correctly invokes the mechanism of enhanced specific counterion condensation (especially by divalent cations) on the more highly charged mutant surface, which reduces the potential at the shear plane and leads to a less negative $\\zeta$-potential. This explanation is fully consistent with the established principles of colloid science applied to bacterial surfaces. **Correct**.\n\n*   **B.** This option incorrectly claims that loss of D-alanylation *decreases* the anionic charge. This is factually wrong. The loss of the cationic D-alanine moieties *increases* the net anionic charge. Furthermore, the premise that LTA are the dominant contributors because they extend furthest is debatable and less generally accepted than the dominant role of the WTA matrix. The fatal flaw is the incorrect statement about the charge effect. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C.** This option proposes a speculative secondary effect: that envelope stress in the mutant leads to a great reduction in WTA abundance. While mutations can have pleiotropic effects, this is an ad-hoc hypothesis. The problem asks for an explanation based on the provided foundational principles, and a direct electrokinetic explanation (as in A) is more parsimonious and directly addresses the physics of the situation. Attributing the result primarily to a hypothetical change in polymer concentration ignores the core biophysical puzzle presented by the data. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D.** This option incorrectly claims the data are inconsistent with electrokinetic theory. The idea that increasing anionic charge density can *never* lead to a less negative $\\zeta$-potential is false. It ignores the well-established phenomena of counterion condensation and charge screening by multivalent ions, which are central to understanding polyelectrolyte systems. Dismissing the observation as measurement error instead of applying the correct physical model is unscientific. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2537163"}]}
