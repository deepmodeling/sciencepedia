It is imperative to maintain consistent units. We will perform calculations in SI units (Joules) and convert the final result to kilojoules.\n\nThe given values are:\n$R = 8.3145\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n$T = 310\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n$K_{o/w} = 1.2 \\times 10^{4}$\n$K_{a/w} = 7.5 \\times 10^{5}$\n$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{LPS}|o} = +5.6\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} = +5600\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{PL}|a} = -1.8\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} = -1800\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, calculate the term involving the partition coefficients:\n$$\n-RT \\ln \\left(\\frac{K_{o/w}}{K_{a/w}}\\right) = -(8.3145\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (310\\ \\mathrm{K}) \\ln \\left(\\frac{1.2 \\times 10^{4}}{7.5 \\times 10^{5}}\\right)\n$$\nThe ratio of partition coefficients is:\n$$\n\\frac{1.2 \\times 10^{4}}{7.5 \\times 10^{5}} = \\frac{1.2}{75} = 0.016\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression:\n$$\n- (2577.495\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}) \\ln(0.016) \\approx - (2577.495\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}) \\times (-4.135166) \\approx +10659.1\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this result into the full expression for $\\Delta\\Delta G$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G \\approx 10659.1\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} + 5600\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} - (-1800\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G \\approx (10659.1 + 5600 + 1800)\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G \\approx 18059.1\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in units of $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, so we convert:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G \\approx 18.0591\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}\n$$\nFinally, rounding the result to three significant figures as requested:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G \\approx 18.1\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}\n$$\nThis positive value signifies that, for this drug, insertion into the LPS-rich outer leaflet is thermodynamically less favorable than insertion into a standard phospholipid bilayer by approximately $18.1\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. This reflects the substantial energetic penalty imposed by the structured, hydrated, and charged environment of the LPS saccharide layer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{18.1}$$", "id": "2516924"}]}
