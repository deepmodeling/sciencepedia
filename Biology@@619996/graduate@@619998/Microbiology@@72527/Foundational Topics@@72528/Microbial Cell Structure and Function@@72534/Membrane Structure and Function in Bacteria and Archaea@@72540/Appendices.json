The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and constraints to compute a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of a ratio $R = E_A / E_B$, where $E_A$ is the expected number of $^{13}\\text{C}$ atoms in the archaeal lipid and $E_B$ is the expected number in the bacterial lipid. We will compute $E_B$ and $E_A$ separately. The expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their expectations, which allows us to sum the expected number of labels over all possible sites.\n\nFirst, we calculate $E_B$, the expected number of $^{13}\\text{C}$ atoms in the bacterial phospholipid.\nThe bacterial lipid comprises two $C_{16}$ fatty acyl chains. A single $C_{16}$ fatty acid is synthesized from one acetyl-CoA primer and seven malonyl-CoA units. Each malonyl-CoA is synthesized from one acetyl-CoA. Thus, one $C_{16}$ chain is constructed from the atoms of $1 + 7 = 8$ acetyl-CoA molecules. According to assumption (iii), all carbons from the acetyl-CoA portions are incorporated into the fatty acid chain. This means a $C_{16}$ chain contains $8$ carbons derived from the $C\\!-\\!1$ position of acetyl-CoA and $8$ carbons derived from the $C\\!-\\!2$ position.\nThe label is at acetyl $C\\!-\\!1$ with a fractional enrichment, or probability, of $p$. The label is absent at acetyl $C\\!-\\!2$. Therefore, only the $8$ carbons in the chain derived from acetyl $C\\!-\\!1$ are potential sites for a $^{13}\\text{C}$ label.\nThe expected number of $^{13}\\text{C}$ atoms in one $C_{16}$ chain is the number of potentially labeled sites multiplied by the probability of labeling at each site: $8 \\times p$.\nThe phospholipid molecule contains two such chains. The total expected number of $^{13}\\text{C}$ atoms in the bacterial lipid is:\n$$E_B = 2 \\times (8p) = 16p$$\n\nNext, we calculate $E_A$, the expected number of $^{13}\\text{C}$ atoms in the archaeal diether lipid.\nThe archaeal lipid consists of two $C_{20}$ isoprenoid chains. A $C_{20}$ isoprenoid chain is a polymer of four $C_5$ IPP units ($4 \\times 5 = 20$). The entire lipid molecule's hydrophobic portion thus contains $2 \\times 4 = 8$ IPP units.\nAssumption (iv) states that each $C_5$ IPP unit contains exactly two carbons derived from the $C\\!-\\!1$ position of acetyl-CoA. These are the only positions that can be labeled from the provided $[1\\!-\\!^{13}\\text{C}]$ acetate precursor.\nThe probability of a label appearing at any one of these sites is $p$.\nThe expected number of $^{13}\\text{C}$ atoms in a single $C_5$ IPP unit is therefore $2 \\times p$.\nThe archaeal lipid contains $8$ IPP units in total. By linearity of expectation, the total expected number of $^{13}\\text{C}$ atoms in the archaeal lipid is the number of IPP units multiplied by the expected number of labels per unit:\n$$E_A = 8 \\times (2p) = 16p$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$.\n$$R = \\frac{E_A}{E_B} = \\frac{16p}{16p}$$\nThis ratio simplifies. For any physically meaningful experiment where there is labeling, $p > 0$. In this case, the expression is:\n$$R = 1$$\nThe ratio is a constant independent of the fractional enrichment $p$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2505869"}, {"introduction": "The distinct chemistries of archaeal and bacterial lipids result in profoundly different membrane architectures, such as the tetraether monolayers found in many extremophilic archaea.

Your discussion will not be graded numerically, but it must be rooted in the quantitative result you obtain for $\\Delta d$ and in the stated assumptions.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is based on established biophysical models and principles, such as the Tanford relation for hydrocarbon chain length and the concept of hydrophobic matching in biological membranes. All necessary parameters and definitions are provided to compute a unique, meaningful solution for the quantitative part of the problem. The qualitative reasoning requested is a direct and logical extension of the quantitative result. Therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the difference in hydrophobic core thickness, $\\Delta d$, between an archaeal tetraether monolayer and a bacterial diacyl bilayer. The thickness is defined by the length of the constituent hydrocarbon chains.\n\nFirst, we calculate the hydrophobic thickness of the archaeal monolayer, $d_{\\mathrm{arch}}$. According to the problem statement, this thickness is equal to the projected length of a single biphytanyl chain containing $n_{\\mathrm{arch}} = 40$ carbon atoms. The projected length, $l(n)$, is given by the Tanford relation:\n$$l(n) = a + b\\,(n - 1)$$\nwhere $a = 1.5$ Å and $b = 1.265$ Å.\n\nFor the archaeal membrane, with $n_{\\mathrm{arch}} = 40$:\n$$d_{\\mathrm{arch}} = l(n_{\\mathrm{arch}}) = a + b\\,(n_{\\mathrm{arch}} - 1)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$d_{\\mathrm{arch}} = 1.5\\,\\text{Å} + (1.265\\,\\text{Å}) \\times (40 - 1)$$\n$$d_{\\mathrm{arch}} = 1.5\\,\\text{Å} + (1.265\\,\\text{Å}) \\times 39$$\n$$d_{\\mathrm{arch}} = 1.5\\,\\text{Å} + 49.335\\,\\text{Å} = 50.835\\,\\text{Å}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the hydrophobic thickness of the bacterial bilayer, $d_{\\mathrm{bac}}$. The membrane is composed of lipids with acyl chains of $n_{\\mathrm{bac}} = 16$ carbons. A bilayer's hydrophobic core thickness is stated to be twice the projected length of one acyl chain.\n$$d_{\\mathrm{bac}} = 2 \\times l(n_{\\mathrm{bac}})$$\nUsing the Tanford relation with $n_{\\mathrm{bac}} = 16$:\n$$d_{\\mathrm{bac}} = 2 \\times [a + b\\,(n_{\\mathrm{bac}} - 1)]$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$d_{\\mathrm{bac}} = 2 \\times [1.5\\,\\text{Å} + (1.265\\,\\text{Å}) \\times (16 - 1)]$$\n$$d_{\\mathrm{bac}} = 2 \\times [1.5\\,\\text{Å} + 18.975\\,\\text{Å}]$$\n$$d_{\\mathrm{bac}} = 2 \\times 20.475\\,\\text{Å} = 40.95\\,\\text{Å}$$\n\nNow, we compute the difference $\\Delta d = d_{\\mathrm{arch}} - d_{\\mathrm{bac}}$:\n$$\\Delta d = 50.835\\,\\text{Å} - 40.95\\,\\text{Å} = 9.885\\,\\text{Å}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\Delta d \\approx 9.89\\,\\text{Å}$$\n\nFor the second part of the inquiry, we must reason about the implications of this thickness difference for transmembrane helices. The principle of hydrophobic matching dictates that the length of a transmembrane protein's hydrophobic domain should ideally match the hydrophobic thickness of the membrane to minimize the system's free energy. Mismatch leads to energetic penalties from either exposing hydrophobic protein residues to the aqueous phase or exposing polar lipid headgroups to the nonpolar membrane core.\n\nGiven the rise per residue of an ideal $\\alpha$-helix is $h = 1.5$ Å/residue, we can estimate the number of residues, $N$, required to span each membrane with zero tilt:\nFor the bacterial membrane:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{bac}} = \\frac{d_{\\mathrm{bac}}}{h} = \\frac{40.95\\,\\text{Å}}{1.5\\,\\text{Å/residue}} = 27.3\\,\\text{residues}$$\nA typical transmembrane helix in such a bacterium would therefore contain approximately $27$ to $28$ residues in its hydrophobic core.\n\nFor the archaeal membrane:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{arch}} = \\frac{d_{\\mathrm{arch}}}{h} = \\frac{50.835\\,\\text{Å}}{1.5\\,\\text{Å/residue}} = 33.89\\,\\text{residues}$$\nA transmembrane helix in this archaeon would need to be significantly longer, approximately $34$ residues.\n\nThe computed difference in thickness, $\\Delta d \\approx 9.89$ Å, corresponds to an additional length of $\\Delta d / h \\approx 9.89 / 1.5 \\approx 6.6$ residues. This is a substantial difference.\n\nIf a protein with a transmembrane helix optimized for the bacterial bilayer (length $\\approx 41$ Å) were inserted into the archaeal monolayer (thickness $\\approx 51$ Å), a severe positive hydrophobic mismatch would occur ($d_{\\mathrm{helix}} < d_{\\mathrm{membrane}}$). The system must adapt to minimize the associated free energy penalty. The possible adaptations are:\n$1$. **Membrane Deformation**: The most direct and immediate response is for the lipid monolayer to locally deform around the short protein. The membrane will thin in the immediate vicinity of the protein to match its hydrophobic length. This deformation induces curvature and compression stress in the lipid chains, which is energetically unfavorable. The energetic cost of this deformation is proportional to the square of the mismatch, $(\\Delta d)^2$, and the circumference of the protein.\n$2$. **Helix Tilting**: Tilting the helix is a common adaptation for a protein that is *longer* than the membrane is thick (negative mismatch). A tilted helix of length $L$ has a projected perpendicular length of $L\\cos(\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the tilt angle. For a protein that is too *short*, as in this scenario, tilting would only decrease its projected length, thus *worsening* the hydrophobic mismatch. Therefore, tilting is not a viable adaptation mechanism here.\n$3$. **Protein Oligomerization**: If multiple mismatched proteins are present, they may aggregate. By forming oligomers, they reduce the total surface area of the protein-lipid interface that is subject to the energetically costly membrane thinning, thereby minimizing the overall free energy penalty.\n\nIn summary, the significant positive mismatch of $\\Delta d \\approx 9.89$ Å would force the archaeal monolayer to undergo substantial local thinning to accommodate the shorter bacterial helix, an energetically costly process that could drive protein aggregation. Evolutionary adaptation, by contrast, would favor proteins with longer transmembrane helices (by approximately $6$ to $7$ residues) to achieve proper matching in archaea with such thick membranes.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{9.89}\n$$", "id": "2505840"}, {"introduction": "The insertion of a protein into a biological membrane is a complex process governed by a delicate energetic balance between favorable and unfavorable interactions.

The reasons cited—larger hydrophobic mismatch ($\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mismatch, arch}} = 6.05$ vs. $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mismatch, bact}} = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$) and a massively increased charging penalty due to lower dielectric ($\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{charge, arch}} = 31.125$ vs. $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{charge, bact}} = 6.225\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$)—are precisely the dominant factors identified in the analysis. **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The helix inserts with similar efficiency in both membranes because the hydrophobic transfer term dominates and is identical in both environments, making thickness and dielectric differences negligible.**\nThis is incorrect. The efficiencies are vastly different. While the hydrophobic term is the main driving force, it is completely overwhelmed by the large penalties in the archaeal case. The differences in thickness and dielectric constant are not negligible; they are the critical determinants of the outcome. **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The helix inserts better into the archaeal monolayer because its lower dielectric amplifies the hydrophobic effect sufficiently to overcome both mismatch and charge penalties.**\nThis is incorrect. The calculations show insertion is far worse in the archaeal monolayer. The reasoning is also flawed; a lower dielectric constant increases the electrostatic penalty (Born term), it does not \"amplify\" the hydrophobic effect as modeled here. **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The helix fails to insert into either membrane because any positively charged flanking residues always render the total insertion free energy positive regardless of membrane properties.**\nThis is incorrect. The calculation shows efficient insertion into the bacterial membrane, demonstrating that charged residues do not universally prevent insertion. Their energetic penalty can be overcome by favorable interactions, as seen in the bacterial case. **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2505820"}]}
