The plate count method, pioneered in Robert Koch's laboratory, established a critical link between a single viable cell and a visible colony. This exercise [@problem_id:2499624] allows you to perform the foundational calculation of determining bacterial concentration from a plate count, reinforcing the statistical and practical principles behind a technique that remains a cornerstone of microbiology today.", "problem": "In the late nineteenth century, the adoption of solid media and the plate count method by Robert Koch, Julius Richard Petri, and the introduction of agar by Angelina Fannie Hesse established the modern operational definition of a colony-forming unit (CFU), where a colony is presumed to arise from a single viable propagule under specified conditions. A contemporary researcher applies this foundation to estimate the viable concentration of a bacterial suspension. A mixed culture is serially diluted in tenfold steps, and at the $10^{-6}$ dilution, a volume of $0.1$ milliliter is spread onto an agar plate. After incubation, exactly $45$ discrete colonies are observed.\n\nAssume that the plate count is generated by independent deposition and growth events such that the number of observed colonies on a plate can be modeled as arising from a Poisson process for dilute suspensions, and that each colony corresponds to a single viable unit. Starting from these foundational assumptions and the definitions of dilution and volume, derive a general expression for the estimator of the original sample concentration in colony-forming units per milliliter, in terms of the observed colony count, plated volume, and dilution. Then, compute its value for the observed data. Finally, state whether the observed count falls within the historically recommended ideal counting window of $30$ to $300$ colonies per plate, and explain the implication for the reliability of the estimate in words.\n\nExpress the final concentration in colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU per mL). Round your numerical answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a general formula for estimating bacterial concentration from a plate count, its application to a specific case, and an analysis of the result's reliability. The validation of the problem statement is the first logical step.\n\nFirst, we extract the given quantities and conditions.\nGivens:\n- Dilution factor, $D = 10^{-6}$.\n- Volume of diluted suspension plated, $V = 0.1$ mL.\n- Observed number of colonies, $N = 45$.\n- The number of colonies is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution.\n- Each colony arises from a single colony-forming unit (CFU).\n- The ideal counting window is specified as $30$ to $300$ colonies.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the fundamental principles of quantitative microbiology, specifically the serial dilution-agar plating method. It is well-posed, providing all necessary data for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The premises are not contradictory, and the scenario is realistic. The problem is therefore valid, and we may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem can be decomposed into three parts: derivation of the general estimator, calculation for the specific data, and interpretation of the result's reliability.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the general estimator for concentration.\nLet $C_{orig}$ be the concentration of viable cells in the original, undiluted sample, with units of CFU/mL.\nA serial dilution is performed. The total dilution factor is given as $D$. This is a dimensionless quantity representing the fraction of the original concentration present in the final dilution tube. For example, a $10^{-6}$ dilution means the concentration is one-millionth of the original.\nThe concentration in the diluted suspension, $C_{dil}$, is therefore:\n$$C_{dil} = C_{orig} \\times D$$\nA volume $V$ of this diluted suspension is transferred to the agar plate. The expected number of colony-forming units, $\\lambda$, plated is the product of the diluted concentration and the plated volume:\n$$\\lambda = C_{dil} \\times V$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{dil}$:\n$$\\lambda = (C_{orig} \\times D) \\times V$$\nThe problem states that the number of colonies observed on the plate, $N$, can be modeled as a random variable from a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda$. The Poisson distribution is appropriate for counting independent, rare events in a fixed interval of space or time. The parameter $\\lambda$ represents the mean, or expected value, of the distribution.\nFor a Poisson process, the maximum likelihood estimator for the parameter $\\lambda$ is simply the observed count, $N$. Thus, we use $N$ as our best estimate for $\\lambda$:\n$$\\hat{\\lambda} = N$$\nWe can now formulate an estimator for the original concentration, $\\hat{C}_{orig}$, by substituting $\\hat{\\lambda}$ back into our equation relating $\\lambda$ and $C_{orig}$:\n$$N = \\hat{C}_{orig} \\times D \\times V$$\nSolving for $\\hat{C}_{orig}$ yields the general expression for the estimator of the original concentration:\n$$\\hat{C}_{orig} = \\frac{N}{D \\times V}$$\nThe units of this estimator are consistent. $N$ is a dimensionless count, $D$ is dimensionless, and $V$ is in mL. The resulting unit for $\\hat{C}_{orig}$ is CFU/mL, as required.\n\nPart 2: Calculation for the given data.\nWe are given the following values:\n- Observed colony count, $N = 45$.\n- Dilution factor, $D = 10^{-6}$.\n- Plated volume, $V = 0.1$ mL.\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived formula:\n$$\\hat{C}_{orig} = \\frac{45}{(10^{-6}) \\times (0.1 \\text{ mL})}$$\nThe denominator simplifies to $10^{-6} \\times 10^{-1} \\text{ mL} = 10^{-7} \\text{ mL}$.\n$$\\hat{C}_{orig} = \\frac{45}{10^{-7} \\text{ mL}} = 45 \\times 10^{7} \\frac{\\text{CFU}}{\\text{mL}}$$\nTo express this in standard scientific notation and round to three significant figures as requested:\n$$\\hat{C}_{orig} = 4.5 \\times 10^{8} \\frac{\\text{CFU}}{\\text{mL}}$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives:\n$$\\hat{C}_{orig} = 4.50 \\times 10^{8} \\frac{\\text{CFU}}{\\text{mL}}$$\n\nPart 3: Reliability of the estimate.\nThe problem states that the historically recommended ideal counting window is between $30$ and $300$ colonies per plate. The observed count is $N = 45$.\nSince the condition $30 \\leq 45 \\leq 300$ is satisfied, the count falls within the ideal window.\n\nThe implication for the reliability of the estimate is significant. This range represents a compromise between two opposing sources of error.\n1.  **Statistical Error at Low Counts:** For counts below $30$, the random error inherent in the Poisson sampling process becomes unacceptably large relative to the count itself. The standard deviation of a Poisson distribution is $\\sqrt{\\lambda}$, so the relative standard deviation is $\\frac{\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}}$. For a small count $N$ (estimating $\\lambda$), this relative error is large. A count of $45$ is large enough to ensure that the statistical fluctuations do not dominate the measurement, thus providing a reasonable level of statistical confidence.\n2.  **Systematic Error at High Counts:** For counts above $300$, colonies on the plate become too dense. This leads to several problems: colonies may grow into one another (confluence), making it impossible to distinguish and count them as discrete units; and competition for limited nutrients can inhibit the growth of some viable cells, causing them not to form visible colonies at all. Both effects lead to an underestimation of the true number of viable cells.\n\nSince the observed count of $45$ lies within the optimal range of $30$ to $300$, it is considered to be a reliable basis for calculation. It is large enough to be statistically robust and small enough to avoid the systematic underestimation caused by overcrowding effects. Therefore, the estimate of $4.50 \\times 10^{8}$ CFU/mL is deemed reliable under the standard practices of this microbiological technique.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.50 \\times 10^{8}}$$", "id": "2499624"}, {"introduction": "While bacteria could be grown on solid media, the quantitative study of viruses—obligate intracellular parasites—required a different approach.

In this practice [@problem_id:2499660], you will apply the same statistical framework to quantify viral particles, or plaque-forming units ($PFU$s), highlighting the adaptability of core quantitative principles across different biological systems.", "problem": "A foundational technique in the history of virology and microbiology is the plaque assay, developed and formalized by researchers including Félix d’Herelle and later Emory Ellis and Max Delbrück. In the one-hit model they articulated, each plaque arises from a single plaque-forming unit (PFU), and the stochastic appearance of plaques on a lawn of susceptible bacteria can be modeled as a rare-event counting process. Assume the following fundamental base for your derivation: (i) a plaque-forming unit (PFU) is defined operationally as a single infectious unit that, upon successful adsorption and replication, produces one plaque; (ii) independent adsorption and subsequent plaque formation events, at sufficiently dilute conditions, result in Poisson-distributed counts; (iii) under the standard soft-agar overlay conditions established in classical assays, adsorption is allowed to completion so that essentially all infectious units present in the plated aliquot that are capable of forming plaques do so, with probability approximately equal to $1$; and (iv) the countable range for accurate plaque enumeration is between $30$ and $300$ plaques per plate.\n\nYou prepare a standard soft-agar overlay plaque assay using a lytic bacteriophage and a dense lawn of host bacteria, plating an aliquot of volume $v = 0.1$ mL from a dilution factor $d = 10^{-7}$ of the original stock. After incubation, you count $n = 150$ well-isolated plaques on the plate, which lies within the acceptable counting range.\n\nStarting only from the definitions and facts above (i–iv), treat plaque counts as a Poisson random variable with mean equal to the expected number of plaques arising from the product of the unknown titer $C$ (in PFU per mL), the dilution factor $d$, and the plated volume $v$. Derive the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the original titer $C$ and then compute its numerical value for the data given.\n\nExpress the final titer in PFU per mL and round your answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) for the original bacteriophage titer, denoted by $C$, based on an observed plaque count from a diluted sample. The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded in the classical principles of quantitative virology.\n\nThe fundamental premise is that the number of plaques, $N$, observed on a plate follows a Poisson distribution. The probability mass function for a Poisson random variable $N$ with mean $\\lambda$ is given by:\n$$ P(N=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!} $$\nwhere $k$ is a non-negative integer.\n\nThe problem states that the mean number of plaques, $\\lambda$, is the expected number of plaque-forming units (PFU) plated. This is determined by the product of the unknown original titer $C$ (in PFU/mL), the dimensionless dilution factor $d$, and the plated volume $v$ (in mL). Thus, the parameter $\\lambda$ is defined as:\n$$ \\lambda = C \\cdot d \\cdot v $$\n\nWe are given a single observation, a plaque count of $n = 150$. To find the MLE of $C$, we first construct the likelihood function, $L(C | n)$. The likelihood of observing $n$ plaques, given the parameter $C$, is the probability of this outcome under the Poisson model.\n$$ L(C | n) = P(N=n | C) = \\frac{(Cdv)^n \\exp(-(Cdv))}{n!} $$\nThe value of $C$ that maximizes this function $L$ is the maximum likelihood estimate, denoted $\\hat{C}$. It is standard procedure to maximize the natural logarithm of the likelihood function, the log-likelihood $\\ell(C | n)$, as this simplifies the mathematics without changing the location of the maximum.\n$$ \\ell(C | n) = \\ln(L(C | n)) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{(Cdv)^n \\exp(-(Cdv))}{n!}\\right) $$\nApplying the properties of logarithms, we expand the expression:\n$$ \\ell(C | n) = \\ln((Cdv)^n) + \\ln(\\exp(-(Cdv))) - \\ln(n!) $$\n$$ \\ell(C | n) = n \\ln(Cdv) - Cdv - \\ln(n!) $$\nFurther expansion separates the terms involving the parameter $C$:\n$$ \\ell(C | n) = n(\\ln(C) + \\ln(d) + \\ln(v)) - Cdv - \\ln(n!) $$\n\nTo find the value of $C$ that maximizes $\\ell(C | n)$, we compute the first derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to $C$ and set it to zero.\n$$ \\frac{d\\ell}{dC} = \\frac{d}{dC} [n \\ln(C) + n \\ln(d) + n \\ln(v) - Cdv - \\ln(n!)] $$\nThe terms $n \\ln(d)$, $n \\ln(v)$, and $\\ln(n!)$ are constants with respect to $C$, so their derivatives are zero.\n$$ \\frac{d\\ell}{dC} = n \\cdot \\frac{1}{C} - dv $$\nSetting this derivative to zero yields the condition for the maximum:\n$$ \\frac{n}{C} - dv = 0 $$\nSolving for $C$ provides the MLE, $\\hat{C}$:\n$$ \\frac{n}{\\hat{C}} = dv $$\n$$ \\hat{C} = \\frac{n}{d \\cdot v} $$\nTo confirm that this is a maximum, we examine the second derivative:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\ell}{dC^2} = \\frac{d}{dC}\\left(\\frac{n}{C} - dv\\right) = -\\frac{n}{C^2} $$\nSince the observed count $n = 150$ is positive, and $C^2$ must be positive, the second derivative is always negative. This confirms that the critical point corresponds to a maximum of the log-likelihood function.\n\nThe derived expression for the MLE of the titer is $\\hat{C} = \\frac{n}{dv}$. This result is intuitive: the estimated concentration is the observed count corrected for the dilution and volume factors.\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into this expression:\nObserved plaque count: $n = 150$\nDilution factor: $d = 10^{-7}$\nPlated volume: $v = 0.1$ mL\n\n$$ \\hat{C} = \\frac{150}{(10^{-7}) \\cdot (0.1 \\text{ mL})} $$\n$$ \\hat{C} = \\frac{150}{10^{-8} \\text{ mL}} $$\n$$ \\hat{C} = 150 \\times 10^8 \\text{ PFU/mL} $$\nExpressing this in standard scientific notation:\n$$ \\hat{C} = 1.5 \\times 10^2 \\times 10^8 \\text{ PFU/mL} = 1.5 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ PFU/mL} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
