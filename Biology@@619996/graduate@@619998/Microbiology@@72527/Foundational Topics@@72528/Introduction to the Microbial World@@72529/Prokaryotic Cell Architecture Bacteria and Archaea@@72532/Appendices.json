According to Hooke's law for linear elasticity, the strain is proportional to the stress, with the constant of proportionality being the inverse of the effective Young's modulus, $E_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{c} = \\frac{\\sigma_{c}}{E_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\sigma_{c}$ into this equation gives:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{c} = \\frac{1}{E_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\left( \\frac{pr}{t} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that the effective Young's modulus is a linear function of the crosslink fraction $f$:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{eff}} = f E_{0}\n$$\nwhere $E_{0}$ is the modulus of a fully crosslinked network. Substituting this into the expression for strain yields:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{c} = \\frac{1}{f E_{0}} \\left( \\frac{pr}{t} \\right) = \\frac{pr}{f E_{0} t}\n$$\nThe structural integrity of the sacculus requires that this strain does not exceed the specified elastic limit, also denoted as $\\varepsilon_{c}$ in the problem statement (we must distinguish the variable strain from the limit). Let us denote the strain limit provided in the givens as $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{limit}}$. The condition is:\n$$\n\\frac{pr}{f E_{0} t} \\le \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{limit}}\n$$\nWe need to find the minimum value of $f$, denoted $f_{\\min}$, that satisfies this condition. Since $f$ is in the denominator, the inequality can be rearranged to solve for $f$.
