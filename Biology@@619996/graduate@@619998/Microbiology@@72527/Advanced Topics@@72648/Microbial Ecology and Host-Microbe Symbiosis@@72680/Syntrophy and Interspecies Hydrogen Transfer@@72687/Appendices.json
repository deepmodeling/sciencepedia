First, a critical validation of the problem statement is necessary. The problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of biochemical thermodynamics and describes a realistic scenario of interspecies hydrogen transfer. All necessary data are provided, and the problem is self-contained and internally consistent.\n\nHowever, the phrasing \"minimal hydrogen partial pressure that makes the ethanol oxidation reaction exergonic\" is imprecise. The reaction is $$\\mathrm{C_2H_5OH + H_2O \\to C_2H_3O_2^- + 2\\,H_2 + H^+}$$ The corresponding transformed Gibbs energy change at constant pH is given by the relation $\\Delta G' = \\Delta G'^{\\circ} + R T \\ln Q'$.

The boundary conditions—constant flux at one end and first-order (linear) uptake kinetics at the other—are common and valid approximations used in biophysical modeling, particularly for microbial metabolism where substrate concentration is low relative to the Michaelis-Menten constant $K_M$. The problem is self-contained, providing a governing differential equation (implicitly) and the necessary number of boundary conditions ($2$) to solve for the concentration profile $C(x)$.

There are no scientific or logical contradictions, no missing information, and the setup is physically plausible within the context of a simplified model.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A rigorous derivation of the solution will now be provided.\n\nThe fundamental principle for mass conservation in a one-dimensional system at steady state with no bulk reactions (sources or sinks) is that the mass flux $J$ must be constant with respect to the spatial coordinate $x$. This is expressed mathematically as:\n$$\n\\frac{dJ}{dx} = 0\n$$\nThis implies that $J(x)$ is a constant for all $x$ in the domain $0 \\le x \\le d$. Let us denote this constant flux as $J_{\\text{const}}$.\n\nThe problem provides a boundary condition for the flux at the producer surface, $x=0$. The flux at this boundary is given as $J_p$. Since the flux must be constant throughout the entire gap, we have:\n$$\nJ(x) = J_{\\text{const}} = J_{p} \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le x \\le d\n$$\n\nNext, we relate the flux $J(x)$ to the concentration gradient using Fick's first law of diffusion:\n$$\nJ(x) = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}\n$$\nwhere $C(x)$ is the concentration of $\\mathrm{H_2}$ at position $x$.\n\nSubstituting the constant flux $J_p$ into Fick's law, we obtain a first-order ordinary differential equation for the concentration $C(x)$:\n$$\nJ_{p} = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged and integrated to find the general form of the concentration profile:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dx} = -\\frac{J_{p}}{D}\n$$\nIntegrating with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\int dC = \\int -\\frac{J_{p}}{D} dx\n$$\n$$\nC(x) = -\\frac{J_{p}}{D}x + A\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the constant of integration. To determine the value of $A$, we must apply the second boundary condition at the consumer surface, $x=d$.\n\nAt $x=d$, the problem states that the uptake flux by the consumer is given by the expression $k\\,C(d)$. By conservation of mass at this boundary, the diffusive flux arriving at the surface must equal the rate of consumption. The diffusive flux at $x=d$ is $J(d)$, which we have already established is equal to $J_p$. Therefore, the boundary condition at $x=d$ is:\n$$\nJ(d) = k\\,C(d)\n$$\n$$\nJ_{p} = k\\,C(d)\n$$\nThis equation provides a relationship that allows us to solve for the integration constant $A$. We can express $C(d)$ using our general solution for $C(x)$ by substituting $x=d$:\n$$\nC(d) = -\\frac{J_{p}}{D}d + A\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $C(d)$ into the boundary condition equation:\n$$\nJ_{p} = k \\left( -\\frac{J_{p}}{D}d + A \\right)\n$$\nWe can now solve for $A$:\n$$\n\\frac{J_{p}}{k} = -\\frac{J_{p}d}{D} + A\n$$\n$$\nA = \\frac{J_{p}}{k} + \\frac{J_{p}d}{D}\n$$\nFactoring out $J_p$, we get:\n$$\nA = J_{p} \\left( \\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{d}{D} \\right)\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for the constant $A$ back into our general solution for the concentration profile $C(x)$:\n$$\nC(x) = -\\frac{J_{p}}{D}x + J_{p} \\left( \\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{d}{D} \\right)\n$$\nFor a more compact and insightful form, we can factor out $J_p$ and group terms involving the diffusion coefficient $D$:\n$$\nC(x) = J_{p} \\left( \\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{d}{D} - \\frac{x}{D} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nC(x) = J_{p} \\left( \\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{d-x}{D} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the steady-state concentration profile $C(x)$ in the gap between the producer and consumer, expressed in terms of the given parameters $J_{p}$, $D$, $k$, $d$, and the spatial variable $x$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{J_{p} \\left( \\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{d-x}{D} \\right)}\n$$", "id": "2536110"}, {"introduction": "This final practice synthesizes the principles of thermodynamics, kinetics, and mass balance into a dynamic model of a complete syntrophic community.

A steady state, or equilibrium, of the system is a point in state space where all time derivatives are equal to zero. Let the steady-state concentrations be denoted by $s^{\\ast}$, $h^{\\ast}$, $X_{s}^{\\ast}$, and $X_{m}^{\\ast}$.

For each species $i$, either its biomass concentration $X_{i}^{\\ast}$ is $0$, or its specific growth rate $\\mu_{i}$ must equal the dilution rate $D$. This gives rise to $2 \\times 2 = 4$ theoretical possibilities for the pair of biomass concentrations $(X_{s}^{\\ast}, X_{m}^{\\ast})$. We analyze each case to identify the dynamically admissible equilibrium classes.\n\n1. Trivial Equilibrium (Complete Washout): $X_{s}^{\\ast} = 0$ and $X_{m}^{\\ast} = 0$.\nIn this scenario, both microbial populations are washed out of the reactor. The mass balance equations simplify considerably.\nThe substrate balance becomes $D(s_{\\mathrm{in}} - s^{\\ast}) = 0$, which implies $s^{\\ast} = s_{\\mathrm{in}}$.\nThe hydrogen balance becomes $-D h^{\\ast} = 0$, which implies $h^{\\ast} = 0$.\nThis equilibrium $(s^{\\ast}, h^{\\ast}, X_{s}^{\\ast}, X_{m}^{\\ast}) = (s_{\\mathrm{in}}, 0, 0, 0)$ always exists. For it to be dynamically admissible (i.e., stable), neither species should be able to invade the reactor. The condition for a species to not invade is that its specific growth rate at the washout concentrations must be less than the dilution rate.\nFor the methanogen: $\\mu_{m}(h^{\\ast}) = \\mu_{m}(0) = 0  D$. This condition is always satisfied for any $D  0$.\nFor the syntroph: We need $\\mu_{s}(s^{\\ast}, h^{\\ast})  D$. At this equilibrium, we evaluate the growth rate at $s^{\\ast} = s_{in}$ and $h^{\\ast} \\to 0^{+}$. In the limit $h \\to 0^{+}$, the term $\\ln h \\to -\\infty$, causing the argument of the exponential in $F(h)$ to go to $-\\infty$. Thus, $\\exp(\\dots) \\to 0$ and $F(h) \\to 1$.\nThe condition becomes $\\mu_{s,\\max} \\left(\\frac{s_{\\mathrm{in}}}{K_{s} + s_{\\mathrm{in}}}\\right) (1)  D$.\nSo, washout is the stable state if the maximum possible syntroph growth rate at the inlet substrate concentration is insufficient to overcome washout.\n\n2. Methanogen-Only Equilibrium: $X_{s}^{\\ast} = 0$ and $X_{m}^{\\ast}  0$.\nIf the syntroph population is absent ($X_{s}^{\\ast}=0$), there is no biological source of hydrogen. The hydrogen balance equation is $\\frac{dh}{dt} = -Dh - k_c \\mu_m(h) X_m$. Since all parameters $D, k_c$ are positive, and $h, \\mu_m(h), X_m$ are non-negative, the derivative $\\frac{dh}{dt}$ is always non-positive. Any existing hydrogen will be consumed and diluted, leading to $h(t) \\to 0$. As $h \\to 0$, the methanogen growth rate $\\mu_m(h) \\to 0$. The methanogen biomass balance becomes $\\frac{dX_m}{dt} = (\\mu_m(h) - D)X_m \\approx -DX_m$, which drives $X_m$ to $0$. Therefore, a steady state with $X_s^{\\ast}=0$ and $X_m^{\\ast}0$ is impossible. The methanogen is an obligate syntrophic partner and cannot survive without the hydrogen-producing syntroph.\n\n3. Syntroph-Only Equilibrium: $X_{s}^{\\ast}  0$ and $X_{m}^{\\ast} = 0$.\nFor the syntroph to persist, its growth rate must match the dilution rate: $\\mu_{s}(s^{\\ast},h^{\\ast}) = D$.\nFor the methanogen to be absent, its growth rate must be insufficient to sustain its population against washout: $\\mu_{m}(h^{\\ast})  D$.\nThe steady-state concentrations $(s^{\\ast}, h^{\\ast}, X_{s}^{\\ast})$ are determined by the remaining balance equations with $X_m^* = 0$.\nFrom the substrate balance: $D(s_{\\mathrm{in}} - s^{\\ast}) - \\frac{1}{Y_{s}} (D) X_{s}^{\\ast} = 0 \\implies X_{s}^{\\ast} = Y_{s}(s_{\\mathrm{in}} - s^{\\ast})$. For $X_{s}^{\\ast}  0$, we require $s^{\\ast}  s_{\\mathrm{in}}$.\nFrom the hydrogen balance: $-D h^{\\ast} + k_{p} (D) X_{s}^{\\ast} = 0 \\implies h^{\\ast} = k_{p} X_{s}^{\\ast}$. For $X_s^*  0$, we must have $h^*  0$.\nThis equilibrium class is characterized by the conditions:\n$\\mu_{s}(s^{\\ast},h^{\\ast}) = D$\n$\\mu_{m}(h^{\\ast})  D$\nwhere $s^{\\ast}$ and $h^{\\ast}$ are positive concentrations that satisfy the coupled algebraic equations arising from the growth kinetics and mass balances.\n\n4. Coexistence Equilibrium: $X_{s}^{\\ast}  0$ and $X_{m}^{\\ast}  0$.\nFor both species to persist, their specific growth rates must both equal the dilution rate. This provides two key algebraic conditions:\n(i) $\\mu_{s}(s^{\\ast},h^{\\ast}) = D$\n(ii) $\\mu_{m}(h^{\\ast}) = D$\nThis is the central part of the problem. Condition (ii) involves only the hydrogen concentration $h^{\\ast}$ and parameters related to the methanogen. This demonstrates that the steady-state hydrogen concentration $h^{\\ast}$ is determined solely by the kinetic properties of the hydrogen consumer (the methanogen) and the operational dilution rate $D$. It is independent of the syntroph's concentration $X_s^{\\ast}$ and kinetics, as well as the methanogen concentration $X_m^{\\ast}$.\n\nWe now derive the explicit expression for $h^{\\ast}$ from this condition:\n$\\mu_{m}(h^{\\ast}) = \\mu_{m,\\max} \\left(\\frac{h^{\\ast}}{K_{h} + h^{\\ast}}\\right) = D$\nRearranging to solve for $h^{\\ast}$:\n$\\mu_{m,\\max} h^{\\ast} = D (K_{h} + h^{\\ast})$\n$\\mu_{m,\\max} h^{\\ast} = D K_{h} + D h^{\\ast}$\n$(\\mu_{m,\\max} - D) h^{\\ast} = D K_{h}$\n$$\nh^{\\ast} = \\frac{D K_{h}}{\\mu_{m,\\max} - D}\n$$\nFor a physically meaningful positive concentration $h^{\\ast} > 0$, the numerator $D K_{h}$ is positive (as $D0$, $K_h0$). Thus, the denominator must also be positive, which imposes the necessary condition for coexistence: $\\mu_{m,\\max} - D > 0$, or $D  \\mu_{m,\\max}$. If this condition is not met, the dilution rate is too high for the methanogen to survive, and coexistence is impossible.\n\nThe remaining state variables ($s^{\\ast}$, $X_{s}^{\\ast}$, $X_{m}^{\\ast}$) can be determined from the other steady-state equations, given that $h^{\\ast}$ is now known. The problem states to assume coexistence is feasible, so we proceed with the numerical evaluation of $h^{\\ast}$.\n\nThe given parameter values are:\n- $D = 0.048\\,\\mathrm{d}^{-1}$\n- $\\mu_{m,\\max} = 0.312\\,\\mathrm{d}^{-1}$\n- $K_{h} = 6.2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we verify the condition $D  \\mu_{m,\\max}$:\n$0.048\\,\\mathrm{d}^{-1}  0.312\\,\\mathrm{d}^{-1}$. The condition holds.\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the derived expression for $h^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nh^{\\ast} = \\frac{(0.048\\,\\mathrm{d}^{-1}) (6.2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1})}{0.312\\,\\mathrm{d}^{-1} - 0.048\\,\\mathrm{d}^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\nh^{\\ast} = \\frac{0.2976 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}}{0.264}\n$$\n$$\nh^{\\ast} = 1.127272... \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as requested:\n$$\nh^{\\ast} \\approx 1.127 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\n$$\nThis completes the required derivations and calculation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.127 \\times 10^{-6}}$$", "id": "2536061"}]}
