In the control group, the absolute abundances (cells per gram) are measured as $x_1^{(0)} = 10^{6}$, $x_2^{(0)} = 10^{9}$, and $x_3^{(0)} = 10^{9}$.

The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\nVerdict: The problem is valid. A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe compositional bias, $B$, is defined as the difference between the log-fold change calculated from relative abundances and the log-fold change calculated from absolute abundances.\n$$B = L_{\\mathrm{rel}} - L_{\\mathrm{abs}}$$\nSubstituting the definitions for $L_{\\mathrm{rel}}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{abs}}$:\n$$B = \\log_{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\tilde{x}_1^{(1)}}{\\tilde{x}_1^{(0)}}\\right) - \\log_{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{x_1^{(1)}}{x_1^{(0)}}\\right)$$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $\\log(a) - \\log(b) = \\log(a/b)$, we combine the terms:\n$$B = \\log_{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\tilde{x}_1^{(1)} / \\tilde{x}_1^{(0)}}{x_1^{(1)} / x_1^{(0)}}\\right) = \\log_{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\tilde{x}_1^{(1)}}{\\tilde{x}_1^{(0)}} \\cdot \\frac{x_1^{(0)}}{x_1^{(1)}}\\right)$$\nThe relative abundance $\\tilde{x}_i^{(k)}$ is defined as the absolute abundance $x_i^{(k)}$ divided by the total microbial load $S^{(k)} = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} x_j^{(k)}$. We substitute this definition for $\\tilde{x}_1^{(1)}$ and $\\tilde{x}_1^{(0)}$:\n$$B = \\log_{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{x_1^{(1)}/S^{(1)}}{x_1^{(0)}/S^{(0)}} \\cdot \\frac{x_1^{(0)}}{x_1^{(1)}}\\right)$$\nThe absolute abundance terms $x_1^{(1)}$ and $x_1^{(0)}$ cancel out, revealing that the bias depends solely on the change in total microbial load between the two conditions:\n$$B = \\log_{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{S^{(0)}}{S^{(1)}}\\right)$$\nThis result is general for any taxon whose absolute abundance does not change. Its apparent change in relative terms is an artifact driven entirely by the change in the total sum.\n\nFirst, we compute the total absolute abundance for the control group ($k=0$):\n$$S^{(0)} = x_1^{(0)} + x_2^{(0)} + x_3^{(0)} = 10^{6} + 10^{9} + 10^{9} = 1 \\times 10^{6} + 2 \\times 10^{9} = 2001 \\times 10^{6} = 2.001 \\times 10^{9}$$\nNext, we compute the total absolute abundance for the disease group ($k=1$):\n$$S^{(1)} = x_1^{(1)} + x_2^{(1)} + x_3^{(1)} = 10^{6} + 5 \\times 10^{8} + 5 \\times 10^{8} = 10^{6} + 10 \\times 10^{8} = 10^{6} + 10^{9} = 1001 \\times 10^{6} = 1.001 \\times 10^{9}$$\nNow we compute the bias $B$:\n$$B = \\log_{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{2.001 \\times 10^{9}}{1.001 \\times 10^{9}}\\right) = \\log_{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{2.001}{1.001}\\right)$$\nUsing the change of base formula for logarithms, $\\log_a(x) = \\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\ln(a)}$:\n$$B = \\frac{\\ln(1.999000999...)}{\\ln(2)} \\approx \\frac{0.69264746}{0.69314718} \\approx 0.99927909$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we obtain $B = 0.9993$.\nThe true log-fold change of $T_1$ is $L_{\\mathrm{abs}} = \\log_{2}(10^6 / 10^6) = \\log_{2}(1) = 0$. The apparent log-fold change is $L_{\\mathrm{rel}} = B+L_{\\mathrm{abs}} \\approx 0.9993$. This indicates that a relative abundance analysis would falsely suggest that taxon $T_1$ approximately doubled its abundance ($\\log_{2}(2) = 1$), when in fact its absolute abundance remained unchanged.\n\nTo address this bias, two primary approaches exist:\n\n1.  **Analysis of Absolute Abundances**: The most direct and scientifically sound method is to abandon relative abundance analysis and conduct statistical tests directly on the absolute abundance data ($x_i^{(k)}$). The problem states these data were acquired. By analyzing these values (typically after a log-transformation, e.g., $\\ln(x_i^{(k)} + 1)$, to stabilize variance), one directly tests hypotheses about the true quantity of interest, the absolute number of cells. This approach completely removes the compositional bias because the denominator $S^{(k)}$ is never introduced into the calculation. In this problem, such an analysis would correctly yield $L_{\\mathrm{abs}}=0$, leading to the correct conclusion that $T_1$ is not associated with the disease state in terms of its absolute count.\n\n2.  **Log-Ratio Analysis (Compositional Data Analysis)**: If absolute abundance data are unavailable and only relative abundances ($\\tilde{x}_i^{(k)}$) can be used, one must employ methods designed for compositional data. The Aitchison geometry provides a framework for this. Instead of analyzing individual components, one analyzes log-ratios of components. For example, one could define an isometric log-ratio (ilr) balance, such as $z = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tilde{x}_1}{\\sqrt{\\tilde{x}_2 \\tilde{x}_3}}\\right)$. Changes in this balance between groups are then tested. Such a ratio is invariant to the scaling of the data (i.e., it is the same for absolute and relative abundances: $\\ln\\left(\\frac{x_1/S}{\\sqrt{(x_2/S)(x_3/S)}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_1}{\\sqrt{x_2 x_3}}\\right)$). This approach does not recover the absolute change of $T_1$. Instead, it reinterprets the analytical question from \"What is the change in $T_1$?\" to \"What is the change in the ratio of $T_1$ to the geometric mean of $T_2$ and $T_3$?\" This is a valid, well-posed question, but its interpretation is fundamentally different. It correctly identifies that the microbial ecosystem's structure has changed with respect to $T_1$, but properly assigns this change to the ratios of components, rather than to a fallacious change in a single component.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of absolute abundance data is superior as it directly addresses the quantity of biological interest. If constrained to relative data, log-ratio analysis provides a mathematically rigorous framework but requires careful reinterpretation of the scientific hypotheses.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.9993}\n$$", "id": "2538319"}, {"introduction": "Having established the pitfalls of analyzing raw proportions, we now turn to the correct mathematical framework for compositional data. Pioneered by John Aitchison, this approach uses log-ratios of components, which are invariant to the total sum and thus immune to the confounding effects of changing library size or total microbial load.

No units are required.", "solution": "The problem statement is critically validated and found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of compositional data analysis (CoDA), a field pioneered by John Aitchison for analyzing data that represent parts of a whole, such as geochemical compositions or, in this case, microbial relative abundances. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique, meaningful solution. It requests the derivation of the centered log-ratio (clr) transformation from first principles, an explanation of its utility, and a specific calculation of the Aitchison distance between two given samples.\n\nFirst, we derive the required transformation. Let a $D$-part composition be represented by a vector of positive real numbers $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_D)$, where $x_i > 0$. The core principle of compositional data is that only the ratios between components, such as $x_i/x_j$, contain meaningful information. A transformation $T(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{y} = (y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_D)$ must be invariant to the total sum or library size (scale invariance). The problem requires that the transformation outputs a real $D$-vector $\\mathbf{y}$ such that its components sum to zero ($\\sum_{i=1}^D y_i = 0$) and its pairwise differences encode all log-ratio information, i.e., $y_i - y_j = \\ln(x_i/x_j)$.\n\nTo satisfy $y_i - y_j = \\ln(x_i) - \\ln(x_j)$, the components of $\\mathbf{y}$ must be of the form $y_i = \\ln(x_i) + c$ for some constant $c$ that is the same for all components $i=1, \\dots, D$.\nTo satisfy the zero-sum constraint, we must have:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{D} y_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{D} (\\ln(x_i) + c) = 0 $$\n$$ \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{D} \\ln(x_i)\\right) + Dc = 0 $$\nSolving for $c$ yields:\n$$ c = -\\frac{1}{D} \\sum_{i=1}^{D} \\ln(x_i) $$\nThis constant $c$ is the negative of the arithmetic mean of the logarithms of the components. The arithmetic mean of logarithms is equivalent to the logarithm of the geometric mean $g(\\mathbf{x}) = (\\prod_{i=1}^D x_i)^{1/D}$. Thus:\n$$ c = -\\ln\\left(\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^D x_i\\right)^{1/D}\\right) = -\\ln(g(\\mathbf{x})) $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $y_i$, we obtain the transformation:\n$$ y_i = \\ln(x_i) - \\ln(g(\\mathbf{x})) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_i}{g(\\mathbf{x})}\\right) $$\nThis transformation is known as the centered log-ratio (clr) transformation. $\\text{clr}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_1}{g(\\mathbf{x})}\\right), \\dots, \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_D}{g(\\mathbf{x})}\\right) \\right]$. This transformation maps a composition from the simplex $S^D$ to a $(D-1)$-dimensional real vector space, satisfying all the stated requirements.\n\nThis transformation is preferable to raw counts for differential abundance testing for several fundamental reasons. Raw counts are subject to variations in sequencing depth (library size), which is a technical artifact, not a biological signal. Direct comparison of counts can thus be misleading. The clr transformation is scale-invariant, meaning it is unaffected by multiplying the entire count vector by a constant, thus removing the influence of library size. Furthermore, compositional data are inherently constrained (e.g., components of a closed composition sum to $1$), which induces spurious negative correlations between components. Applying standard statistical tests (e.g., t-tests) that assume independence to raw or normalized counts can lead to a high rate of false discoveries. The clr transformation, by focusing on log-ratios, correctly handles this compositional structure and moves the data into a Euclidean space (Aitchison geometry) where distances are well-defined and meaningful, enabling the use of more appropriate statistical methods.\n\nNow, we compute the Aitchison distance between Sample A and Sample B. The raw count vectors are:\nSample A: $\\mathbf{c}_A = \\left[100,\\,50,\\,0,\\,850\\right]$\nSample B: $\\mathbf{c}_B = \\left[200,\\,25,\\,25,\\,750\\right]$\n\nWe apply an additive smoothing pseudocount of $+1$ to handle the zero count.

Assume butyrate binds to HDAC with an apparent dissociation constant $K_i$ and cooperativity described by a Hill coefficient $h$, under the condition that the free butyrate concentration equals the supplied extracellular concentration $B$ (in millimolar, mM).

Butyrate ($B$) acts as an inhibitor. The binding of butyrate to HDAC is described by the Hill equation, which models cooperative ligand binding.

Let $A(t)$ be the fraction of acetylated histones, where $A \\in [0, 1]$. The fraction of unacetylated histones is correspondingly $(1 - A)$.\n\nThe rate of acetylation is proportional to the unacetylated fraction, with rate constant $k_{\\text{hat}}$. The rate of deacetylation is proportional to the acetylated fraction, with an effective rate constant $k_{\\text{d,eff}}(B)$ that depends on the butyrate concentration. This effective rate is the baseline deacetylation rate, $k_{\\text{d0}}$, scaled by the fraction of active HDAC:\n$$\nk_{\\text{d,eff}}(B) = k_{\\text{d0}} \\cdot f_{\\text{active}}(B) = k_{\\text{d0}} \\frac{K_i^h}{K_i^h + B^h}\n$$\nThe differential equation governing the fraction of acetylated histones is:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = k_{\\text{hat}}(1 - A) - k_{\\text{d,eff}}(B) A\n$$\nAt steady state, $\\frac{dA}{dt} = 0$. Let $A^\\ast$ be the steady-state fraction of acetylated histones.\n$$\nk_{\\text{hat}}(1 - A^\\ast) = k_{\\text{d,eff}}(B) A^\\ast\n$$\nSolving for $A^\\ast$ yields:\n$$\nk_{\\text{hat}} = (k_{\\text{hat}} + k_{\\text{d,eff}}(B)) A^\\ast \\implies A^\\ast(B, k_{\\text{hat}}) = \\frac{k_{\\text{hat}}}{k_{\\text{hat}} + k_{\\text{d,eff}}(B)}\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Steady-State mRNA Expression**\n\nThe rate of IL-10 mRNA synthesis, $s_m$, is assumed to be a linear function of the steady-state histone acetylation fraction, $A^\\ast$. This represents the opening of chromatin structure, enabling transcription.\n$$\ns_m = r_0 + \\alpha A^\\ast\n$$\nwhere $r_0$ is the basal transcription rate and $\\alpha$ is the acetylation-dependent enhancement. mRNA molecules degrade via a first-order process with rate constant $\\delta_m$. The dynamics of the mRNA copy number per cell, $M(t)$, are given by:\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = s_m - \\delta_m M\n$$\nAt steady state, $\\frac{dM}{dt} = 0$. The steady-state mRNA copy number, $M^\\ast$, is:\n$$\nM^\\ast = \\frac{s_m}{\\delta_m} = \\frac{r_0 + \\alpha A^\\ast}{\\delta_m}\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Steady-State Protein Expression and Secretion Flux**\n\nThe intracellular IL-10 protein pool, $P(t)$, is populated through translation from mRNA and depleted through a combination of secretion and degradation. Translation occurs at a rate $k_{\\text{tl}} M$, and protein loss is a first-order process with rate constant $\\delta_p$.\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = k_{\\text{tl}} M - \\delta_p P\n$$\nAt steady state, with $M = M^\\ast$, the protein level $P^\\ast$ is:\n$$\nP^\\ast = \\frac{k_{\\text{tl}} M^\\ast}{\\delta_p}\n$$\nThe problem defines the secreted flux, $J$, as being proportional to the intracellular protein concentration, with a proportionality constant $k_{\\text{sec}}$:\n$$\nJ = k_{\\text{sec}} P^\\ast = k_{\\text{sec}} \\frac{k_{\\text{tl}} M^\\ast}{\\delta_p}\n$$\n\n**Step 5: Final Expression for Secretion Flux**\n\nBy substituting the expressions for the intermediate steady-state quantities, we can derive the final closed-form expression for the secretion flux $J$ as a function of the independent variables $B$ and $k_{\\text{hat}}$ and the fixed system parameters.\nSubstituting $M^\\ast$ into the equation for $J$:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{k_{\\text{sec}} k_{\\text{tl}}}{\\delta_p} \\left(\\frac{r_0 + \\alpha A^\\ast}{\\delta_m}\\right) = \\frac{k_{\\text{sec}} k_{\\text{tl}}}{\\delta_p \\delta_m} (r_0 + \\alpha A^\\ast)\n$$\nNext, substituting the expression for $A^\\ast$:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{k_{\\text{sec}} k_{\\text{tl}}}{\\delta_p \\delta_m} \\left( r_0 + \\alpha \\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{hat}}}{k_{\\text{hat}} + k_{\\text{d,eff}}(B)} \\right) \\right)\n$$\nFinally, substituting the expression for $k_{\\text{d,eff}}(B)$:\n$$\nJ(B, k_{\\text{hat}}) = \\frac{k_{\\text{sec}} k_{\\text{tl}}}{\\delta_p \\delta_m} \\left( r_0 + \\alpha \\frac{k_{\\text{hat}}}{k_{\\text{hat}} + k_{\\text{d0}} \\frac{K_i^h}{K_i^h + B^h}} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression used for the computation.
