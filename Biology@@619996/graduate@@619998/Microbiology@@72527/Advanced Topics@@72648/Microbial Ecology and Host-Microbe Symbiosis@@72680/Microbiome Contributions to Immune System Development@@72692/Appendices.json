In design one, germ-free mice are randomly assigned at time $t=0$ to either receive colonization with a defined, cultured community (treatment $T=1$) or to remain germ-free (control $T=0$), and are maintained in identical isolators with standardized diet, housing, and handling. An immune outcome $Y$ (for example, the frequency of a regulatory T cell subset in the intestinal lamina propria) is measured at a fixed time $t>0$. In design two, a human birth cohort is observed without intervention: infants’ gut microbiomes are profiled at multiple time points and immune phenotypes are measured; associations between microbiome features and $Y$ are analyzed.\n\nUsing counterfactual reasoning grounded in widely accepted causal inference principles and core microbiological facts about manipulability of exposures, select the statements that correctly explain why the germ-free colonization experiment can establish a stronger causal claim about microbiome effects on immune development than observational human cohort correlations.\n\nA.

The concepts invoked—causal inference, counterfactuals, confounding—are central tenets of modern biostatistics and epidemiology. The problem is firmly grounded in established scientific and statistical practice.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides clear descriptions of two distinct study designs and asks for a comparative evaluation of their ability to support causal claims. This is a well-defined task that has a determinate set of correct answers based on established principles of research methodology.\n- **Objective:** The language used to describe the two designs is factual and neutral. It does not contain subjective or biased terminology.\n\nThe problem statement exhibits none of the disqualifying flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, ill-posed, or trivial. It poses a substantive question about the hierarchy of evidence in scientific research.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe central task is to compare the strength of causal inference from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in an animal model with that from an observational human study. The \"gold standard\" for establishing causality is the RCT. Its power stems from **randomization**, which, on average, creates two or more groups that are comparable (i.e., **exchangeable**) on all baseline characteristics, both measured and unmeasured.\n\nLet $Y_i(1)$ be the potential immune outcome for mouse $i$ if it were to be colonized ($T=1$), and $Y_i(0)$ be its potential outcome if it were to remain germ-free ($T=0$). The causal effect for this mouse is $Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$. The average causal effect (ACE) in the population is $E[Y(1) - Y(0)]$. We can only observe one of these potential outcomes for each mouse. The quantity we can estimate from the data is the association $E[Y | T=1] - E[Y | T=0]$. Because randomization makes the groups exchangeable, meaning the distribution of potential outcomes is the same regardless of treatment received ($ (Y(1), Y(0)) \\perp T $), this association equals the ACE: $E[Y | T=1] - E[Y | T=0] = E[Y(1)] - E[Y(0)]$.\n\nIn the human observational study, individuals are not randomized. People with certain microbiome features may systematically differ from others in diet, genetics, socioeconomic status, and other environmental exposures. These factors, known as **confounders**, can influence both the microbiome and the immune outcome, creating a spurious association. Thus, for an observational study, $E[Y | T=1] - E[Y | T=0]$ does not, in general, equal the ACE.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. In the mouse experiment, random assignment of colonization ensures that, under consistency and no interference, the average difference in the immune outcome between colonized and control mice estimates the causal effect, because the treated and control groups are exchangeable; in the human cohort, without controlled assignment, this exchangeability need not hold.**\nThis statement is a precise and accurate application of causal inference theory. Randomization is the mechanism that achieves exchangeability between the treated ($T=1$) and control ($T=0$) groups. When exchangeability holds, the observed average difference in outcomes is an unbiased estimator of the average causal effect. The statement correctly contrasts this with the observational human cohort, where the lack of randomization means exchangeability is not guaranteed due to potential confounding.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. In the human cohort, any sufficiently large sample size makes a correlation between a microbiome feature and the immune outcome equivalent to a causal effect, regardless of diet, host genotype, or environmental confounding.**\nThis statement is fundamentally false. A large sample size reduces random error (variance) and increases the precision of an estimate, but it does nothing to eliminate systematic error (bias), such as confounding. An infinitely large study with confounding will converge on a precise but incorrect, non-causal estimate. Confounding is a structural problem of non-comparability between groups, not an issue of statistical noise that can be overcome with a large sample.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. By actively manipulating colonization with a defined community, the exposure is well-defined in dose and timing, making the consistency assumption ($Y$ equals the potential outcome under the received treatment) plausible and reducing interference so that the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) approximately holds; in observational human cohorts, the exposure (for example, high relative abundance of a taxon) bundles heterogeneous mechanisms, weakening the link to a single counterfactual and complicating causal identification.**\nThis statement correctly identifies another critical aspect of causal inference: the necessity of a well-defined intervention. SUTVA comprises two components: consistency and no interference. The mouse experiment is designed to satisfy SUTVA. The intervention is a \"defined, cultured community\" administered at $t=0$, which is specific and supports the consistency assumption. Housing mice in separate isolators is an explicit attempt to prevent microbial cross-talk, thus satisfying the \"no interference\" assumption. In contrast, an observational \"exposure\" like \"high relative abundance of a taxon\" is ill-defined. It does not correspond to a single, specifiable intervention and could arise from many different underlying causes (e.g., diet, antibiotics, host genetics), each of which represents a different counterfactual scenario. This ambiguity, or \"bundling,\" severely complicates causal claims.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Because mice are germ-free before colonization, the experimental design eliminates all sources of bias, including measurement error and selection bias, so any observed association must be causal.**\nThis statement is an over-simplification and an overstatement. No real-world experiment is perfect. While the design is powerful and minimizes many critical sources of bias, it does not eliminate *all* of them. For instance, measurement of the outcome $Y$ is still subject to error. Post-randomization events, such as differential death or morbidity between the groups (a form of selection bias), can compromise the initial randomization. The claim that \"any observed association *must* be causal\" is an absolute that is unachievable in empirical science. The design provides *strong evidence* for causality, but it does not provide absolute proof.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The mouse experiment can achieve strong internal validity for the causal effect within the experimental system by satisfying exchangeability and related assumptions, but its external validity to diverse human populations may be limited; in contrast, an observational human cohort may better represent real-world variability but offers weaker internal causal identification.**\nThis statement correctly articulates the classic trade-off between internal and external validity. **Internal validity** refers to the degree of confidence that the causal relationship being tested is trustworthy within the context of the study. The mouse RCT, with its high degree of control and randomization, has strong internal validity. **External validity** (or generalizability) refers to the extent to which the study's results can be applied to other populations or settings. Findings from inbred mice in sterile isolators may not directly translate to genetically diverse humans in complex, \"dirty\" environments. The observational human cohort, by its nature, studies the population of interest in its natural setting, giving it a potential advantage in representing real-world heterogeneity, but at the cost of the weak internal (causal) validity already discussed.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**F. Randomization is unnecessary in the human cohort because regression adjustment for measured covariates always guarantees that an estimated association equals a causal effect under any data-generating process.**\nThis statement is false. Statistical adjustment (e.g., using regression models) can only control for **measured** confounders. In any observational study, there is a persistent risk of **unmeasured confounding**—factors that are not recorded but still influence both the exposure and the outcome. To claim that adjustment \"always guarantees\" a causal effect is incorrect. Causal identification via adjustment requires the strong, often untestable, assumption that all common causes of the exposure and outcome have been measured and correctly included in the model.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nFinal conclusion: Statements A, C, and E correctly describe the relative strengths and weaknesses concerning causal inference for the two study designs.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "2513001"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principles of causality, the next step is to translate a complex biological question into a feasible and rigorous experimental plan. The \"critical window\" hypothesis is a central concept in developmental immunology, suggesting that the timing of microbial encounters can permanently shape immune function [@problem_id:2513073]. This practice challenges you to design the most robust experiment possible to test this hypothesis, forcing you to consider appropriate controls, multi-level outcome measures, and strategies to minimize confounding—all hallmarks of sophisticated experimental design.", "problem": "A central question in host-microbe immunology is whether there exists a critical postnatal window during which microbial colonization imprints long-term regulatory T cell (Treg) homeostasis. Consider that: (i) gnotobiotic mice permit control over exposure to microorganisms; (ii) differentiation and maintenance of Treg cells require T cell receptor stimulation in the presence of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-$\\beta$) and interleukin-$2$ (IL-$2$), and microbiota provide antigens and microbial-associated molecular patterns that shape this process; (iii) early life tissue niches exhibit heightened plasticity and differential cytokine milieus compared to adulthood; and (iv) maternal transfer of microbes and microbial products can occur via birth and milk. You are tasked with testing whether colonization at postnatal day $1$ (P$1$) versus postnatal day $21$ (P$21$) differentially programs long-term Treg frequencies, using gnotobiotic mice, with appropriate controls and measurable endpoints that distinguish timing effects from microbiota composition differences.\n\nWhich experimental design most rigorously isolates the effect of colonization timing on long-term Treg frequencies while controlling for confounders, and specifies appropriate controls and endpoints?\n\nA. Germ-free litters are generated by cesarean section and fostered to germ-free dams. Entire dam–litter units are randomized to be colonized with an identical defined consortium of commensals at P$1$ or at P$21$. Immediately after the P$21$ colonization, all colonized groups are co-housed to standardize post-colonization environment and promote microbiota convergence, while a lifelong germ-free arm remains segregated as a negative control. A conventionalized-at-birth arm (colonized at P$1$ with a complex specific pathogen-free (SPF) fecal community) serves as a positive control for maximal Treg induction. Endpoints are assessed in adulthood at $t = 12$ weeks and include: frequency of forkhead box P$3$ (Foxp$3$)$^+$ CD$4^+$ T cells in colon lamina propria and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) by flow cytometry; ex vivo IL-$10$ production by Treg cells; Treg suppressive function in a standard proliferation assay; and epigenetic stability via bisulfite sequencing of the Foxp$3$ conserved noncoding sequence $2$ (CNS$2$) demethylation. Microbiota composition and load are verified to be comparable between the P$1$ and P$21$ groups at $t = 8$ and $t = 12$ weeks by $16$S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, with randomization, blinding, and sample size $n \\geq 10$ per arm.\n\nB. Conventional SPF mouse litters are kept with their dams and receive a broad-spectrum antibiotic cocktail in drinking water from P$1$ to P$21$ versus no antibiotics. Mice are analyzed at P$28$ for serum lipopolysaccharide and total immunoglobulin E as surrogate markers of immune development. No gnotobiotic techniques are used, and no assessment of microbiota composition is performed.\n\nC. Germ-free pups receive a single gavage of a defined microbial consortium at P$1$ versus P$21$, but each group is kept in separate isolators for the entire study. Endpoints at $t = 6$ weeks include the frequency of Foxp$3^+$ CD$4^+$ T cells in spleen only, assessed by flow cytometry. No functional assays or epigenetic measures are included, and there are no additional control arms.\n\nD.

The concepts of gnotobiotics, regulatory T cells (Tregs), the role of the microbiota in immune education, and the \"critical window\" hypothesis are all central and valid topics in current scientific research. The stated biological principles are factually correct.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It asks for the evaluation of several experimental designs against a clear and specific scientific objective: to isolate the effect of timing of colonization on Treg development.

It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective question pertaining to experimental design in immunology. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe objective is to design an experiment that rigorously isolates the variable of *timing* of microbial colonization (P$1$ versus P$21$) on the long-term programming of regulatory T cell (Treg) populations. A scientifically rigorous design must satisfy several critical criteria:\n\n1.  **Control of the Independent Variable (Microbiota):** To test the effect of *timing*, the microbial stimulus itself must be held constant. This means the groups colonized at P$1$ and P$21$ must receive an identical microbial inoculum. Furthermore, it is crucial to control for and verify that the microbial communities in both groups are comparable at the time of analysis, as any divergence could confound the results. An effect attributed to timing might actually be an effect of a different adult microbiota composition that resulted from the different colonization time point.\n2.  **Use of an Appropriate Model System:** The problem correctly specifies gnotobiotic (germ-free) mice. This is the only system that allows for complete control over microbial exposure from birth, which is essential for this experiment.\n3.  **Inclusion of Proper Controls:** A robust design must include:\n    *   A **negative control**: Lifelong germ-free (GF) mice to establish the baseline Treg frequency in the complete absence of microbial stimuli.\n    *   A **positive control**: Mice colonized with a complex, potent stimulus (e.g., a conventional specific pathogen-free (SPF) microbiota) at birth. This serves as a benchmark for maximal or \"natural\" Treg induction.\n4.  **Comprehensive and Relevant Endpoints:** To assess \"long-term Treg homeostasis,\" multiple parameters must be measured in relevant anatomical locations.\n    *   **Frequency and Number:** The percentage and absolute number of Foxp$3^+$ CD$4^+$ T cells, the canonical Treg population, are the primary readouts. These must be measured in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT), such as the colon lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), which are primary sites of host-microbe interaction.\n    *   **Functionality:** Treg frequency alone is insufficient. Their suppressive function must be verified, for instance, through *ex vivo* suppression assays or by measuring the production of key anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-$10$.\n    *   **Stability:** The concept of \"imprinting\" implies a stable, long-lasting change. This can be assessed by measuring the epigenetic stability of the Treg lineage, for example, by analyzing the demethylation status of the *Foxp3* gene's conserved noncoding sequence $2$ (CNS$2$), a key epigenetic hallmark of stable Tregs.\n5.  **Minimization of Confounding Variables:** Rigorous experimental practice requires randomization of animals to treatment arms, blinding of investigators during data acquisition and analysis, and a sufficient sample size ($n$) to achieve statistical power. Controlling for \"cage effects\" by co-housing animals after colonization standardizes their environment and encourages microbial community convergence.\n\nWith these criteria established, the provided options are evaluated.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Germ-free litters are generated by cesarean section and fostered to germ-free dams. Entire dam–litter units are randomized to be colonized with an identical defined consortium of commensals at P$1$ or at P$21$. Immediately after the P$21$ colonization, all colonized groups are co-housed to standardize post-colonization environment and promote microbiota convergence, while a lifelong germ-free arm remains segregated as a negative control.

Co-housing is used to mitigate divergence post-colonization. Critically, it includes *verification* of microbiota similarity using $16$S rRNA sequencing and qPCR, which is the definitive check for this potential confounder.\n- **Model System:** It correctly uses gnotobiotic mice generated by C-section and fostered to GF dams, which is the gold standard for controlling maternal transfer.\n- **Controls:** It includes both a lifelong germ-free negative control and a conventionalized positive control.\n- **Endpoints:** The endpoints are comprehensive and state-of-the-art. They measure Treg frequency (Foxp$3^+$ CD$4^+$ in colon and MLN), function (IL-$10$, suppression assay), and stability (CNS$2$ demethylation) at a long-term time point ($12$ weeks).\n- **Confounder Control:** It specifies randomization, blinding, and an adequate sample size ($n \\ge 10$).\n\nVerdict: **Correct**. This is an exemplary experimental design that directly and rigorously addresses the scientific question.\n\n**B. Conventional SPF mouse litters are kept with their dams and receive a broad-spectrum antibiotic cocktail in drinking water from P$1$ to P$21$ versus no antibiotics. Mice are analyzed at P$28$ for serum lipopolysaccharide and total immunoglobulin E as surrogate markers of immune development. No gnotobiotic techniques are used, and no assessment of microbiota composition is performed.**\n\nThis design is fundamentally flawed.\n- **Model System:** It uses conventional SPF mice, not gnotobiotic mice. This fails to provide a clean baseline and control over initial colonization.\n- **Control of Microbiota:** Administering antibiotics does not equate to preventing colonization. It merely depletes the existing community in an uncontrolled manner. Comparing this to \"no antibiotics\" does not test the timing of *initial* colonization. The lack of microbiota assessment is a fatal flaw.\n- **Endpoints:** Serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and immunoglobulin E (IgE) are poor, indirect, and non-specific markers for Treg homeostasis.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**. This design fails to test the stated hypothesis.\n\n**C. Germ-free pups receive a single gavage of a defined microbial consortium at P$1$ versus P$21$, but each group is kept in separate isolators for the entire study. Endpoints at $t = 6$ weeks include the frequency of Foxp$3^+$ CD$4^+$ T cells in spleen only, assessed by flow cytometry. No functional assays or epigenetic measures are included, and there are no additional control arms.**\n\nThis design has significant weaknesses.\n- **Confounder Control:** Keeping the groups in *separate isolators* introduces the \"isolator effect\" or \"cage effect\" as a major uncontrolled confounding variable. Any observed differences could be artifacts of the separate environments rather than the timing of colonization.\n- **Controls:** It lacks a lifelong germ-free negative control and a conventionalized positive control.\n- **Endpoints:** The endpoints are minimal. Measuring Treg frequency only in the spleen is suboptimal, as the primary interactions occur in the gut. The absence of functional and stability assays weakens any conclusion about long-term homeostasis. The $6$-week time point is less \"long-term\" than desired.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**. The use of separate isolators is a critical design flaw, and the endpoints are insufficient.\n\n**D. Germ-free pups are monocolonized with Bacteroides fragilis at P$1$, while a separate group is colonized at P$21$ with an SPF fecal transplant. At $t = 12$ weeks, Foxp$3^+$ CD$4^+$ T cell frequencies are measured in colon and MLN. A lifelong germ-free control is included. No co-housing or microbiota verification is performed.**\n\nThis design is invalid due to a fundamental confounding of variables.\n- **Control of Microbiota:** It compares colonization with a single bacterium (*Bacteroides fragilis*) at P$1$ against colonization with a highly complex community (SPF feces) at P$21$. This design confounds two variables: the *timing* of colonization and the *composition* of the colonizing microbiota. Any observed difference cannot be attributed specifically to timing.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**. The experiment does not isolate the variable of interest.\n\n**E. Germ-free pups are kept germ-free until P$21$, then receive adoptive transfer of naive CD$4^+$ T cells from conventional donors and are colonized with SPF feces. Another group is colonized at P$1$ but receives no adoptive transfer. Endpoints at $t = 12$ weeks include T cell receptor repertoire diversity by bulk sequencing and serum cytokine multiplexing. No verification of equivalent microbiota is performed, and no functional Treg assays are included.**\n\nThis design is also invalid due to confounding variables and irrelevant endpoints.\n- **Confounding Variables:** It compares two vastly different treatments: (colonization at P$1$) versus (colonization at P$21$ + adoptive transfer of T cells). The adoptive transfer is a massive intervention that makes a direct comparison regarding colonization timing impossible.\n- **Endpoints:** The endpoints (TCR repertoire diversity, serum cytokines) are not direct measures of Treg homeostasis (frequency, function, stability). While potentially interesting, they do not answer the primary question.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**. The experimental arms are not comparable, and the endpoints are not appropriate for testing the hypothesis.\n\nIn summary, only option A describes an experiment with the necessary rigor, controls, and endpoints to validly test the hypothesis regarding a critical window for Treg imprinting.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2513073"}, {"introduction": "Beyond establishing that an effect exists, a key goal of modern microbiology is to quantify the underlying mechanisms.

The equation becomes:\n$$ 0 = P_{m} S ([B]_{L} - [B]_{i}^{\\ast}) - k_{u} [B]_{i}^{\\ast} V $$\nWe solve this algebraic equation for $[B]_{i}^{\\ast}$:\n$$ P_{m} S [B]_{L} - P_{m} S [B]_{i}^{\\ast} = k_{u} V [B]_{i}^{\\ast} $$\n$$ P_{m} S [B]_{L} = (k_{u} V + P_{m} S) [B]_{i}^{\\ast} $$\nThis yields the expression for the steady-state intracellular butyrate concentration:\n$$ [B]_{i}^{\\ast} = \\frac{P_{m} S [B]_{L}}{k_{u} V + P_{m} S} $$\nThis is the first required derivation.\n\nSecond, we derive the fractional HDAC activity, $\\phi$. Butyrate ($B$) inhibits the enzyme ($E$) by binding to a single inhibitor site, forming an inactive complex $EB$. The equilibrium is $E + B \\rightleftharpoons EB$. The dissociation constant $K_{i}$ is defined as:\n$$ K_{i} = \\frac{[E][B]_{i}}{[EB]} $$\nwhere $[B]_{i}$ is the intracellular butyrate concentration. The total enzyme concentration, $[E]_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the free (active) enzyme, $[E]$, and the bound (inactive) complex, $[EB]$:\n$$ [E]_{\\text{total}} = [E] + [EB] $$\nThe fractional activity, $\\phi$, is the ratio of the concentration of active enzyme to the total enzyme concentration.\n$$ \\phi = \\frac{[E]}{[E]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[E]}{[E] + [EB]} $$\nFrom the definition of $K_{i}$, we express $[EB]$ in terms of $[E]$ and $[B]_{i}$: $[EB] = \\frac{[E][B]_{i}}{K_{i}}$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\phi$ gives:\n$$ \\phi = \\frac{[E]}{[E] + \\frac{[E][B]_{i}}{K_{i}}} $$\nThe term $[E]$ is common to all terms and can be canceled, which results in the second required derivation:\n$$ \\phi = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[B]_{i}}{K_{i}}} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $\\phi$ using the provided parameters:\n$P_{m}=1.2\\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$, $S=5.0\\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}}$, $V=2.0\\times 10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{m^{3}}$, $k_{u}=0.015\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, $[B]_{L}=10\\ \\mathrm{mM}$, and $K_{i}=2.0\\ \\mathrm{mM}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate $[B]_{i}^{\\ast}$. It is convenient to first compute the dimensionless ratio $\\frac{k_{u}V}{P_{m}S}$:\n$$ \\frac{k_{u}V}{P_{m}S} = \\frac{(0.015\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}})(2.0\\times 10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{m^{3}})}{(1.2\\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}})(5.0\\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}})} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-17}\\ \\mathrm{m^{3}\\,s^{-1}}}{6.0 \\times 10^{-17}\\ \\mathrm{m^{3}\\,s^{-1}}} = 0.5 $$\nNow substitute this into the expression for $[B]_{i}^{\\ast}$:\n$$ [B]_{i}^{\\ast} = \\frac{[B]_{L}}{1 + \\frac{k_{u} V}{P_{m} S}} = \\frac{10\\ \\mathrm{mM}}{1 + 0.5} = \\frac{10\\ \\mathrm{mM}}{1.5} = \\frac{20}{3}\\ \\mathrm{mM} $$\nNow we use this steady-state concentration to calculate the fractional activity $\\phi$:\n$$ \\phi = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[B]_{i}^{\\ast}}{K_{i}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{(20/3)\\ \\mathrm{mM}}{2.0\\ \\mathrm{mM}}} $$\n$$ \\phi = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{20}{3 \\times 2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{10}{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{3} + \\frac{10}{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{13}{3}} = \\frac{3}{13} $$\nThe problem requires a decimal answer rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\phi = \\frac{3}{13} \\approx 0.23076923... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.2308$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2308}$$", "id": "2513003"}]}
