The total rate of autoinducer synthesis in the volume is $s \\times N_{cells} = s \\rho V$. The volumetric production rate is this total rate divided by the volume $V$, which gives $s \\rho$.\n\nThe decay of the autoinducer is a first-order process, meaning the rate of decay is proportional to its concentration. The volumetric decay rate is given by $k C(t)$.\n\nCombining these terms, we formulate the ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the autoinducer concentration:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = (\\text{Volumetric Production Rate}) - (\\text{Volumetric Decay Rate})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = s \\rho - k C\n$$\nNote that the system volume $V$ is irrelevant for determining the concentration, as it is an intensive property and the system is well-mixed.\n\nThe problem asks for the steady-state concentration, which we will denote as $C_{ss}$.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe Malthusian fitness ($W$) of an individual is defined as the baseline fitness plus all accrued benefits and minus all incurred costs. We must formulate the fitness functions for the two genotypes: the producer ($W_P$) and the loss-of-function mutant ($W_M$). These fitnesses are functions of the producer frequency, $p$.\n\nThe fitness of a producer, $W_P$, is determined by the following components:\n1.  Baseline fitness: $1$.\n2.  Cost of maintaining the function: $-c$.\n3.  Private benefit retained from its own production: $(1-l)b$. This benefit is independent of the frequency of other producers.\n4.  Public benefit received from the entire population of producers: $l b p$. This benefit is proportional to the fraction $p$ of producers in the population.\n\nSumming these components gives the fitness of a producer:\n$$W_P(p) = 1 - c + (1-l)b + l b p$$\n\nThe fitness of a loss-of-function mutant, $W_M$, is determined by:\n1.  Baseline fitness: $1$.\n2.  Cost: $0$, as it does not maintain the function.\n3.  Private benefit: $0$, as it does not produce the good.\n4.  Public benefit received from the population of producers: $l b p$.\n\nSumming these components gives the fitness of a mutant:\n$$W_M(p) = 1 + l b p$$\n\nThe problem asks for the selection coefficient, $s$, of a *rare* loss-of-function mutant invading a resident population of producers. This scenario corresponds to an environment where the producer frequency $p$ is approximately $1$. The selection coefficient is the fitness difference between the mutant and the resident type in this specific environment. Therefore, we evaluate the fitness of both types at $p \\approx 1$.\n\nThe fitness of the rare mutant in a population of producers is $W_M(p \\to 1)$:\n$$W_{mutant} = W_M(1) = 1 + l b (1) = 1 + lb$$\n\nThe fitness of the resident producer in a population of producers is $W_P(p \\to 1)$:\n$$W_{resident} = W_P(1) = 1 - c + (1-l)b + l b (1) = 1 - c + b - lb + lb = 1 - c + b$$\n\nThe selection coefficient, $s$, is the relative fitness advantage of the mutant over the resident:\n$$s = W_{mutant} - W_{resident}$$\n$$s = (1 + lb) - (1 - c + b)$$\n$$s = 1 + lb - 1 + c - b$$\n$$s = c - b + lb$$\nFactoring out $b$ from the last two terms gives the final expression for the selection coefficient:\n$$s = c - b(1-l)$$\nThis result is intuitive: the mutant gains by saving the cost $c$ but loses the private benefit $(1-l)b$ that it would have received as a producer. Invasion by the mutant is favored ($s > 0$) if the cost saved is greater than the private benefit forgone. The public good component, $lbp$, is received by both types equally and thus cancels out in the fitness comparison.\n\nNow, we evaluate $s$ using the provided numerical values: $l=0.6$, $c=0.02$, and $b=0.05$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $s$:\n$$s = 0.02 - 0.05(1 - 0.6)$$\n$$s = 0.02 - 0.05(0.4)$$\n$$s = 0.02 - 0.02$$\n$$s = 0$$\nA selection coefficient of $s=0$ indicates that the loss-of-function mutant is selectively neutral when rare in this specific environment.

The numerator sum becomes $\\sum_{k=0}^{0} \\prod_{j=1}^{k} \\gamma_j = 1$.

In this case, the neutral fixation probability is $1/10^6 = 1 \\times 10^{-6}$.\nOur calculated fixation probability is $\\rho \\approx 0.009901$, or approximately $9.9 \\times 10^{-3}$.\nLet us compare the two probabilities:\n$$ \\frac{\\rho}{1/N} \\approx \\frac{0.009901}{10^{-6}} \\approx 9901 $$\nThe cheater's fixation probability is almost $10,000$ times greater than that expected from genetic drift alone. This indicates a very strong effect of positive selection.\nA general rule in population genetics is that selection dominates drift when the product of the population size and the selection coefficient is much greater than one, i.e., $Ns \\gg 1$.\nIn this scenario, $Ns = 10^6 \\times 0.01 = 10^4$. Since $10^4 \\gg 1$, the condition for selection to be the dominant force is strongly satisfied. The advantageous mutation is highly likely to increase in frequency due to selection, overcoming the random effects of genetic drift that would otherwise likely lead to its loss when it is rare.\nTherefore, selection is expected to dominate the cheater's fate.\n\nThe problem requires reporting only the numerical value for the fixation probability in the final answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.009901}$$", "id": "2512325"}]}
