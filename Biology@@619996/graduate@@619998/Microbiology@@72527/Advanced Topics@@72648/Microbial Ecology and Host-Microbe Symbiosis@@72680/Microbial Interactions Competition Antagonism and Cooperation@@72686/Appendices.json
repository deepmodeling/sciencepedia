In monoculture, each follows logistic growth with an intrinsic rate of increase $r_i$ and carrying capacity $K_i$, for $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$. In co-culture, interspecific competition reduces growth according to a Lotka–Volterra competition form in which the effect of the other species is linearly proportional to its abundance. Consider the following model class that is consistent with these assumptions:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_1}{dt} \\;=\\; r_1 N_1\\Big(1 - \\frac{N_1}{K_1} - \\alpha_{12} N_2\\Big), \n\\qquad\n\\frac{dN_2}{dt} \\;=\\; r_2 N_2\\Big(1 - N_2 - \\alpha_{21} N_1\\Big).\n$$\nHere, $N_i$ is the abundance of species $i$, $r_i$ its intrinsic rate (per unit time), and $K_1$ the carrying capacity of species 1 in monoculture.

The coefficients $\\alpha_{12}$ and $\\alpha_{21}$ quantify interspecific competition. The model for species $2$ implies its carrying capacity in monoculture is $K_2 = 1$. The problem is based on established ecological theory, provides all necessary conditions, and is free of contradiction or ambiguity. It is thus a valid problem.\n\nThe per capita growth rate for any population $N_i$ is defined as $\\frac{1}{N_i}\\frac{dN_i}{dt}$. We are tasked with finding this quantity for species $2$. From the given differential equation for $N_2$, we divide by $N_2$ to obtain the per capita growth rate of species $2$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{N_2}\\frac{dN_2}{dt} = r_2\\Big(1 - N_2 - \\alpha_{21} N_1\\Big)\n$$\nThis expression gives the per capita growth rate of species $2$ for any given abundances $N_1$ and $N_2$.\n\nThe problem specifies the conditions at the moment of invasion. First, the resident species, species $1$, is established at its single-species equilibrium. The single-species equilibrium for species $1$ is found by setting $\\frac{dN_1}{dt}=0$ in its dynamic equation, with $N_2=0$ (monoculture) and $N_1  0$.\n$$\nr_1 N_1\\Big(1 - \\frac{N_1}{K_1}\\Big) = 0\n$$\nThe non-trivial equilibrium is $1 - \\frac{N_1}{K_1} = 0$, which yields $N_1 = K_1$. This is the carrying capacity, as expected.\n\nSecond, the invading species, species $2$, is introduced at a very low abundance. This is mathematically represented as $N_2 \\to 0$. Under this condition, the density-dependent feedback of species $2$ on itself, the term $-N_2$ inside the parenthesis of its growth rate equation, becomes negligible.\n\nNow, we evaluate the per capita growth rate of species $2$ under these specific invasion conditions: the resident is at its equilibrium ($N_1 = K_1$) and the invader is rare ($N_2 \\to 0$). We substitute these values into the expression for the per capita growth rate of species $2$:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{1}{N_2}\\frac{dN_2}{dt} \\right|_{\\substack{N_1=K_1 \\\\ N_2 \\to 0}} = r_2\\Big(1 - 0 - \\alpha_{21} K_1\\Big)\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the instantaneous per capita growth rate of species $2$ upon introduction:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{1}{N_2}\\frac{dN_2}{dt} \\right|_{\\text{invasion}} = r_2(1 - \\alpha_{21} K_1)\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression required.\n\nFor invasion to be successful, this initial per capita growth rate must be positive. Assuming the intrinsic rate $r_2  0$, the condition for successful invasion is:\n$$\n1 - \\alpha_{21} K_1  0 \\implies 1  \\alpha_{21} K_1\n$$\nBiologically, this inequality states that species $2$ can invade the environment created by species $1$ at its carrying capacity only if the total competitive pressure exerted by species $1$ (the term $\\alpha_{21} K_1$) is not sufficient to make the growth rate of species $2$ negative. The term `$1$` on the left-hand side reflects the normalized carrying capacity ($K_2=1$) of species $2$ in the absence of any competition. In essence, invasion is successful if the interspecific competition from the resident is weaker than the invader's own intraspecific limitation at its carrying capacity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{r_2(1 - \\alpha_{21} K_1)}\n$$", "id": "2511006"}, {"introduction": "Moving from phenomenological models to mechanistic ones, this practice explores how competition for limiting resources structures microbial communities.

All necessary parameters are provided, and the framework is consistent with established ecological theory. The problem is valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe analysis hinges on the concept of the Zero Net Growth Isocline (ZNGI) for each species. The ZNGI for species $i$ is the set of resource concentrations $(R_{1}, R_{2})$ for which the per-capita net growth rate $g_{i}$ is zero. Given the linear growth model $g_{i}(R_{1},R_{2}) = c_{i1} R_{1} + c_{i2} R_{2} - \\rho$, the ZNGI is a line in the resource plane defined by the equation $c_{i1} R_{1} + c_{i2} R_{2} = \\rho$. For a species to persist at steady state, its net growth must be zero. Therefore, any steady-state with a surviving population must correspond to resource concentrations $(R_{1}^{*}, R_{2}^{*})$ that lie on that species' ZNGI.\n\nUsing the provided parameters $\\rho = 1\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, $c_{11} = 0.9$, $c_{12} = 0.1$, $c_{21} = 0.3$, $c_{22} = 0.7$, $c_{31} = 0.4$, and $c_{32} = 0.4$, the ZNGI equations are:\nZNGI for species 1: $0.9 R_{1} + 0.1 R_{2} = 1$\nZNGI for species 2: $0.3 R_{1} + 0.7 R_{2} = 1$\nZNGI for species 3: $0.4 R_{1} + 0.4 R_{2} = 1$\n\n**Task 1: Determination of the coexisting subset and exclusion of the third species**\n\nFor two species, say $i$ and $j$, to coexist, the steady-state resource concentrations $(R_{1}^{*}, R_{2}^{*})$ must satisfy both of their ZNGI equations simultaneously. This corresponds to the intersection point of their ZNGIs. For this coexistence to be stable, any other species $k$ must be unable to invade, which means its net growth rate at these resource levels must be negative, i.e., $g_{k}(R_{1}^{*}, R_{2}^{*})  0$.\n\nLet us find the potential two-species coexistence points and check their stability against invasion by the third species.\n\nCoexistence of species 1 and 2:\nWe solve the system of linear equations:\n$$0.9 R_{1} + 0.1 R_{2} = 1$$\n$$0.3 R_{1} + 0.7 R_{2} = 1$$\nMultiplying the first equation by $7$ gives $6.3 R_{1} + 0.7 R_{2} = 7$. Subtracting the second equation from this new equation yields:\n$(6.3 R_{1} - 0.3 R_{1}) + (0.7 R_{2} - 0.7 R_{2}) = 7 - 1$\n$$6.0 R_{1} = 6 \\implies R_{1}^{*} = 1$$\nSubstituting $R_{1}^{*} = 1$ into the first equation:\n$0.9(1) + 0.1 R_{2} = 1 \\implies 0.1 R_{2} = 0.1 \\implies R_{2}^{*} = 1$.\nThe coexistence point for species 1 and 2 is $(R_{1}^{*}, R_{2}^{*}) = (1, 1)$.\n\nNow, we must check if species 3 can invade this steady state. We evaluate its growth rate at these resource concentrations:\n$g_{3}(1, 1) = c_{31}(1) + c_{32}(1) - \\rho = 0.4(1) + 0.4(1) - 1 = 0.8 - 1 = -0.2$.\nSince $g_{3}(1, 1)  0$, species 3 has a negative net growth rate and will be washed out from the chemostat if introduced. This means the coexistence of species 1 and 2 is stable with respect to invasion by species 3.\n\nFor completeness, examining the other pairs shows they are not stable. The intersection of ZNGIs for species 1 and 3 occurs at $(15/16, 25/16)$, where $g_2  0$. The intersection for species 2 and 3 occurs at $(15/8, 5/8)$, where $g_1  0$. In both cases, the third species can invade, destabilizing the two-species coexistence.\n\nFinally, we must verify the chemostat mass balance feasibility condition. The steady-state point is $\\mathbf{R}^{*} = (R_{1}^{*}, R_{2}^{*}) = (1, 1)$. The supply point is $\\mathbf{S} = (S_{1}, S_{2}) = (3, 3)$. The consumption vectors, which in this linear model are proportional to $(c_{i1}, c_{i2})$, can be taken as $\\mathbf{v}_{1} = (0.9, 0.1)$ and $\\mathbf{v}_{2} = (0.3, 0.7)$. The condition requires that the vector $\\mathbf{S} - \\mathbf{R}^{*}$ is a non-negative linear combination of the consumption vectors of the survivors.\n$\\mathbf{S} - \\mathbf{R}^{*} = (3-1, 3-1) = (2, 2)$. We must find $\\alpha_{1} \\ge 0$ and $\\alpha_{2} \\ge 0$ such that $\\alpha_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1} + \\alpha_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2} = (2, 2)$.\n$$\\alpha_{1} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.9 \\\\ 0.1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\alpha_{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.3 \\\\ 0.7 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nSolving this system yields $\\alpha_{1} = 4/3$ and $\\alpha_{2} = 8/3$. Since both coefficients are positive, the condition is met. This confirms that a steady state with positive populations of both species 1 and 2 is physically possible.\n\nTherefore, the only subset of species that can coexist is **{species 1, species 2}**. Species 3 is excluded because the coexisting pair maintains resource concentrations at a level $(1, 1)$ that is too low for species 3 to have a positive net growth rate. Geometrically, the ZNGI of species 3 lies entirely outside of the point $(1,1)$, in the region of higher resource availability.\n\n**Task 2: Explanation for why at most two species can coexist**\n\nThis is a direct consequence of the competitive exclusion principle in the context of this model. For $N_{sp}$ species to coexist at a steady state, the resource concentrations $(R_{1}^{*}, R_{2}^{*})$ must simultaneously satisfy the ZNGI condition for all of them:\n$$c_{i1} R_{1}^{*} + c_{i2} R_{2}^{*} = \\rho, \\quad \\text{for } i = 1, \\dots, N_{sp}$$\nThis constitutes a system of $N_{sp}$ linear equations in two variables, $R_{1}^{*}$ and $R_{2}^{*}$.\n- If $N_{sp} = 2$, we have two equations and two unknowns. As long as the two ZNGI lines are not parallel (i.e., the vectors $(c_{11}, c_{12})$ and $(c_{21}, c_{22})$ are not collinear), there exists a unique solution $(R_{1}^{*}, R_{2}^{*})$.\n- If $N_{sp} = 3$, we have three linear equations in two unknowns. Such a system is overdetermined and, in general, has no solution. A solution would exist only in the degenerate case where all three ZNGI lines happen to intersect at a single point.\n- Given that the ZNGIs for species 1, 2, and 3 do not intersect at a common point, there is no resource concentration pair $(R_{1}^{*}, R_{2}^{*})$ at which all three species can have zero net growth. At any steady state determined by at most two species, the third will have either a positive or negative growth rate. If negative, it is excluded. If positive, it will grow and alter the resource concentrations, disrupting the previous steady state.\n\nThus, in a system with two limiting resources and linear growth responses, at most two species can coexist at a steady state. The number of coexisting species cannot exceed the number of limiting factors.\n\n**Task 3: Computation of the steady-state concentration of $R_{1}^{*}$**\n\nAs determined in Task 1, the coexisting species are species 1 and species 2. The steady-state resource concentrations $(R_{1}^{*}, R_{2}^{*})$ are found at the intersection of their respective ZNGIs. We have already solved this system of equations:\n$$0.9 R_{1}^{*} + 0.1 R_{2}^{*} = 1$$\n$$0.3 R_{1}^{*} + 0.7 R_{2}^{*} = 1$$\nThe solution to this system is $(R_{1}^{*}, R_{2}^{*}) = (1, 1)$. The problem asks for the steady-state concentration of resource 1, which is $R_{1}^{*}$.\n\nThe value is $R_{1}^{*} = 1$.
