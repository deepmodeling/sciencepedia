The provided numerical values are within plausible biological ranges for such a system. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and does not violate any fundamental principles of biochemistry or physics.\n\nStep 3: Verdict.\nThe problem is valid and can be solved.\n\nThe derivation of the influx density begins with the kinetic scheme for the transporter carrier ($T$) binding the substrate, which is inorganic phosphate ($S$), from the periarbuscular space. The substrate-bound complex ($TS$) then undergoes an irreversible translocation step.\n\nThe reaction scheme is:\n$$ T + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} TS \\stackrel{k_2}{\\longrightarrow} T_{\\mathrm{cyt}} + P_{\\mathrm{cyt}} $$\nHere, $T$ and $S$ are the free transporter sites and substrate in the periarbuscular space, respectively. $k_1$ is the bimolecular rate constant for binding, $k_{-1}$ is the rate constant for dissociation, and $k_2$ is the rate constant for translocation. $T_{\\mathrm{cyt}}$ represents the regenerated transporter facing the cytosol, which is assumed to return to the periarbuscular face rapidly, and $P_{\\mathrm{cyt}}$ is the phosphate released into the plant cytosol.\n\nLet $[T]_{\\mathrm{total}}$ be the total concentration (or, more accurately, surface density) of the transporter. At any given moment, the transporter is either free ($[T]$) or substrate-bound ($[TS]$).\n$$ [T]_{\\mathrm{total}} = [T] + [TS] $$\nThe problem specifies steady-state conditions. This implies that the rate of formation of the $TS$ complex is equal to its rate of breakdown.\n$$ \\frac{d[TS]}{dt} = 0 = k_1 [T][S] - (k_{-1} + k_2)[TS] $$\nSubstituting $[T] = [T]_{\\mathrm{total}} - [TS]$ into the steady-state equation gives:\n$$ k_1 ([T]_{\\mathrm{total}} - [TS])[S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[TS] $$\nWe rearrange to solve for the concentration of the substrate-bound complex, $[TS]$:\n$$ k_1 [T]_{\\mathrm{total}} [S] - k_1 [TS] [S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[TS] $$\n$$ k_1 [T]_{\\mathrm{total}} [S] = (k_1 [S] + k_{-1} + k_2)[TS] $$\n$$ [TS] = \\frac{k_1 [T]_{\\mathrm{total}} [S]}{k_1 [S] + k_{-1} + k_2} $$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $k_1$:\n$$ [TS] = \\frac{[T]_{\\mathrm{total}} [S]}{[S] + \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1}} $$\nThe net influx density, $J_{\\mathrm{Pi}}$, is the rate of product formation per unit area, which is determined by the translocation step:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{Pi}} = k_2 [TS] $$\nSubstituting the expression for $[TS]$:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{Pi}} = k_2 \\frac{[T]_{\\mathrm{total}} [S]}{[S] + \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1}} = \\frac{k_2 [T]_{\\mathrm{total}} [S]}{[S] + \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1}} $$\nThis equation has the form of the Michaelis-Menten equation. We identify the parameters given in the problem:\nThe maximal transport capacity per unit area, $V_{\\max}$, is achieved when the transporter is saturated with substrate ($[S] \\to \\infty$), meaning nearly all transporter molecules are in the bound state ($[TS] \\to [T]_{\\mathrm{total}}$). Thus, $V_{\\max} = k_2 [T]_{\\mathrm{total}}$.\nThe half-saturation constant, $K_{m}$, is defined as the substrate concentration at which the reaction velocity is half of $V_{\\max}$. From the structure of the equation, this constant is $K_m = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1}$.\n\nSubstituting these definitions into the expression for $J_{\\mathrm{Pi}}$ and replacing the general substrate concentration $[S]$ with the specific periarbuscular phosphate concentration $[\\mathrm{Pi}]_{\\mathrm{pa}}$ yields the required expression:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{Pi}} = \\frac{V_{\\max} [\\mathrm{Pi}]_{\\mathrm{pa}}}{K_m + [\\mathrm{Pi}]_{\\mathrm{pa}}} $$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for the influx density using the provided parameters.

The roles and relative positions of $\\text{SYMRK}$, nuclear $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ spiking, $\\text{CCaMK}$, $\\text{CYCLOPS}$, $\\text{CASTOR}$, and $\\text{POLLUX}$ are consistent with established scientific literature on legume symbiosis. The premise is factually sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a defined signaling pathway and poses a question about the consequence of a specific perturbation (a loss-of-function mutation). The scope is clearly limited to the provided information (\"Based solely on the signaling topology...\"), allowing for a unique, logical deduction.\n- **Objective**: The language used is technical, precise, and devoid of subjective claims.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides a self-contained and internally consistent model. It defines all necessary components and their relationships for the deduction required. There are no contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It presents a standard conceptual challenge in molecular biology. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. We proceed to the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires a deduction of the phenotypic consequences of a loss-of-function mutation in either the $\\text{CASTOR}$ or $\\text{POLLUX}$ gene, based on the provided signaling model.\n\n$1$. The problem states that $\\text{CASTOR}$ and $\\text{POLLUX}$ encode cation channels at the nuclear envelope and that they are \"necessary for generating nuclear $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ oscillations.\"\n\n$2$. A loss-of-function mutation in a gene that is \"necessary\" for a biological process means that the process will be abolished. Therefore, in a `castor` or `pollux` mutant, the generation of nuclear $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ oscillations upon perception of microbial signals ($\\text{LCOs}$) will fail.\n\n$3$. The signal cascade is presented as linear. Nuclear $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ oscillations are decoded by $\\text{CCaMK}$. Without the $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ signal, $\\text{CCaMK}$ cannot be activated.\n\n$4$. Inactive $\\text{CCaMK}$ will fail to activate its downstream targets, the transcriptional regulators (e.g., $\\text{CYCLOPS}$).\n\n$5$. Failure to activate these transcriptional regulators will, in turn, prevent the execution of the \"downstream developmental programs.\" The problem explicitly lists these programs as \"rhizobial infection thread initiation\" and \"AM fungal... arbuscule differentiation.\" Thus, both symbiotic processes will be blocked at these key developmental stages.\n\n$6$. The signaling pathway is initiated upstream by cell-surface receptors. The mutation in $\\text{CASTOR}$ or $\\text{POLLUX}$ affects a component located at the nuclear envelope. Therefore, events that are upstream of the nuclear envelope, such as the initial perception of microbial signals at the plasma membrane and subsequent receptor-proximal responses, should remain intact. Such early responses include root hair deformation induced by rhizobial Nod factors and the formation of a hyphopodium (an appressorium-like structure) by an $\\text{AM}$ fungus on the root surface. The signal is perceived, but its transduction is blocked at the level of nuclear signaling.\n\nIn summary, the predicted phenotype for a loss-of-function mutation in $\\text{CASTOR}$ or $\\text{POLLUX}$ is:\n- Abolition of nuclear $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ oscillations.\n- Blockade of both rhizobial infection and $\\text{AM}$ arbuscule formation, as both depend on the common downstream pathway.\n- Persistence of early, receptor-proximal responses.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Nuclear $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ spiking is abolished; rhizobial infection thread initiation in root hairs and AM arbuscule formation are both blocked, but receptor-proximal epidermal responses such as root hair deformation to Nod factor and fungal hyphopodium formation can still occur.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with the logical deduction derived above. It correctly identifies the primary molecular defect (loss of $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$-spiking), the consequences for downstream developmental programs for both symbioses (blockade of infection and arbuscule formation), and the preservation of upstream, receptor-proximal events.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Infection thread initiation proceeds normally due to compensatory epidermal channels, but infection thread progression is arrested in the cortex; AM arbuscule formation is largely unaffected because CASTOR and POLLUX operate redundantly with cortical channels specific to AM.**\nThis option introduces concepts not present in the problem statement, such as \"compensatory epidermal channels\" and \"redundancy with cortical channels.\" The statement that infection thread initiation proceeds normally and $\\text{AM}$ formation is unaffected contradicts the central premise that both processes depend on the described $\\text{CSSP}$ pathway, which is now broken. The problem specifies that $\\text{CCaMK}$ activation is required for infection thread *initiation*, so it cannot proceed normally.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Nod factor perception is eliminated because CASTOR and POLLUX are the primary Nod factor receptors; therefore, neither root hair deformation nor any mycorrhizal surface responses are observed.**\nThis statement misidentifies the function of $\\text{CASTOR}$ and $\\text{POLLUX}$. The problem text clearly distinguishes between \"plasma membrane or cell surface receptor-like kinases\" (the actual receptors) and the \"nuclear-localized ion channel complexes\" encoded by $\\text{CASTOR}$ and $\\text{POLLUX}$. They are not receptors. Consequently, the conclusion that early responses like root hair deformation are eliminated is also false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Rhizobial infection thread initiation is unaffected because it does not use the CSSP, whereas AM arbuscule formation is completely abolished because only the AM pathway relies on nuclear $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ spiking.**\nThis statement makes two assertions that directly contradict the problem description. First, it claims rhizobial infection does not use the $\\text{CSSP}$, whereas the problem states the $\\text{CSSP}$ integrates signals from *both* rhizobia and $\\text{AM}$ fungi. Second, it claims only the $\\text{AM}$ pathway uses nuclear $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ spiking, which again contradicts the premise of a \"Common\" pathway where nuclear oscillations are a central hub.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Loss of CASTOR or POLLUX hyperactivates CCaMK due to relief of ion-channel-mediated feedback, causing spontaneous infection threads and ectopic arbuscules even in the absence of microbes.**\nThis option posits an outcome opposite to logical expectation. $\\text{CASTOR}$ and $\\text{POLLUX}$ are positive regulators required to generate the activating signal ($\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ oscillations) for $\\text{CCaMK}$. A loss-of-function mutation in a positive regulator leads to a loss of downstream activity, not hyperactivity. The phenotype described (spontaneous nodules/arbuscules) is characteristic of a constitutively active, or gain-of-function, mutation in a downstream component like $\\text{CCaMK}$, not a loss-of-function mutation in an upstream activator. The notion of \"relief of... feedback\" is an unsupported speculation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2522623"}, {"introduction": "Having examined the molecular machines and signaling logic, we now zoom out to view the symbiosis as an economic partnership.

The plant photosynthesizes carbon at a constant rate $P$ (mol C per unit time). It allocates carbon $C_{p}$ to its own biomass synthesis and carbon $C_{t}$ to the rhizobia for trade, with $P = C_{p} + C_{t}$. The plant’s biomass formation is limited by Liebig’s law of the minimum between carbon and nitrogen supply under a fixed stoichiometric requirement: for each mol of nitrogen incorporated, the plant must incorporate $\\phi_{p}$ mol of carbon in biomass. Hence, if the plant receives $N_{\\text{in}}$ mol N per unit time from the symbiont, its biomass carbon production rate is $G_{p} = \\min\\{C_{p}, \\,\\phi_{p} N_{\\text{in}}\\}$. \n\nThe rhizobia receive $C_{t}$ mol C per unit time from the plant.

It is a standard problem in theoretical biology, modeling resource exchange in a symbiosis. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to derive the condition for mutually feasible and beneficial trade and then to determine the competitive equilibrium exchange rate $x^{\\ast}$. We begin by analyzing the constraints and objectives of each partner, the plant and the rhizobia.\n\nFor the plant, the total photosynthetically fixed carbon, $P$, is allocated to its own biomass, $C_{p}$, and to the rhizobia for trade, $C_{t}$. The carbon balance is given by:\n$$P = C_{p} + C_{t}$$\nThe plant receives $N_{\\text{in}}$ moles of nitrogen from the rhizobia. The exchange rate, $x$, is defined as the moles of nitrogen delivered per mole of carbon received by the symbiont:\n$$N_{\\text{in}} = x C_{t}$$\nThe plant's growth, measured as the rate of carbon incorporated into biomass, $G_{p}$, is determined by Liebig's law of the minimum, subject to a fixed stoichiometric requirement of $\\phi_{p}$ moles of carbon per mole of nitrogen:\n$$G_{p} = \\min\\{C_{p}, \\, \\phi_{p} N_{\\text{in}}\\}$$\nA crucial assumption is that the plant operates under co-limitation by carbon and nitrogen. This means there are no surplus resources, and the arguments of the minimum function are equal:\n$$C_{p} = \\phi_{p} N_{\\text{in}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $N_{\\text{in}}$ into the co-limitation condition, we get:\n$$C_{p} = \\phi_{p} x C_{t}$$\nWe can now use the plant's carbon balance, $P = C_{p} + C_{t}$, to express both $C_{p}$ and $C_{t}$ in terms of the total carbon fixation $P$ and the exchange rate $x$.\n$$P = (\\phi_{p} x C_{t}) + C_{t} = C_{t}(1 + \\phi_{p} x)$$\nSolving for $C_{t}$:\n$$C_{t}(x) = \\frac{P}{1 + \\phi_{p} x}$$\nUnder the co-limitation assumption, the plant's growth rate $G_{p}$ is equal to its carbon allocation for biomass, $C_{p}$. We find $C_{p}$ using $C_{p} = P - C_{t}$:\n$$G_{p}(x) = C_{p}(x) = P - \\frac{P}{1 + \\phi_{p} x} = \\frac{P(1 + \\phi_{p} x) - P}{1 + \\phi_{p} x} = \\frac{P \\phi_{p} x}{1 + \\phi_{p} x}$$\nThis equation for $G_{p}(x)$ represents the plant's fitness as a function of the exchange rate $x$. For the trade to be beneficial to the plant, its growth with the symbiont must be greater than without it. Since there is no external nitrogen source, growth without the symbiont ($x=0$) would be $G_p(0) = 0$. Therefore, any exchange rate $x > 0$ is beneficial to the plant.\n\nNow, we analyze the rhizobia. The rhizobia receive $C_{t}$ moles of carbon from the plant. They use this carbon to fix a total amount of atmospheric nitrogen, $N_{f}$, at a fixed carbon cost of $k_{C}$ moles of carbon per mole of nitrogen fixed. The carbon consumed for fixation is $k_{C} N_{f}$. The rhizobia must also retain some carbon for their own growth and maintenance, let this be $C_{r}$. The rhizobial carbon budget is:\n$$C_{t} = k_{C} N_{f} + C_{r}$$\nThe rhizobia deliver $N_{\\text{in}}$ to the plant and retain the rest, $N_{r}$, for their own growth. The nitrogen budget is:\n$$N_{f} = N_{\\text{in}} + N_{r}$$\nFor the symbiosis to be feasible for the rhizobia, they must be able to sustain themselves and grow. This requires that they retain some resources, meaning $C_{r} > 0$ and $N_{r} > 0$.\nThe condition $C_{r} > 0$ implies $C_{t} > k_{C} N_{f}$, which can be rearranged to $N_{f} < \\frac{C_{t}}{k_{C}}$.\nThe condition $N_{r} > 0$ implies $N_{f} > N_{\\text{in}}$.\nCombining these two inequalities, we have a condition on the total nitrogen fixed, $N_{f}$:\n$$N_{\\text{in}} < N_{f} < \\frac{C_{t}}{k_{C}}$$\nFor this interval to be non-empty, it must be that $N_{\\text{in}} < \\frac{C_{t}}{k_{C}}$. Substituting the definition $N_{\\text{in}} = x C_{t}$:\n$$x C_{t} < \\frac{C_{t}}{k_{C}}$$\nSince trade occurs, $C_{t} > 0$, and we can divide by it without changing the inequality's direction:\n$$x < \\frac{1}{k_{C}}$$\nThis inequality represents the fundamental feasibility constraint for the rhizobia. The exchange rate $x$ must be less than the maximum theoretical rate of nitrogen fixation per unit of carbon, $1/k_{C}$. So, for a mutually feasible and beneficial trade, the exchange rate must satisfy $0 < x < \\frac{1}{k_{C}}$.\n\nFinally, we determine the competitive equilibrium exchange rate, $x^{\\ast}$. The problem states that the plant acts in a competitive environment where it can select the most favorable exchange rate $x$. The plant's objective is to maximize its own growth, $G_{p}(x)$. To find the trend, we take the derivative of $G_{p}(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\\frac{dG_{p}}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{P \\phi_{p} x}{1 + \\phi_{p} x} \\right) = \\frac{(P \\phi_{p})(1 + \\phi_{p} x) - (P \\phi_{p} x)(\\phi_{p})}{(1 + \\phi_{p} x)^2} = \\frac{P \\phi_{p}}{(1 + \\phi_{p} x)^2}$$\nSince $P>0$ and $\\phi_p>0$, the derivative $\\frac{dG_{p}}{dx}$ is always positive for $x \\geq 0$. This means that $G_{p}(x)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $x$. A rational plant will always prefer a higher exchange rate $x$.\n\nIn a competitive market, different rhizobial partners will compete for the plant's carbon. This competition will force them to offer increasingly favorable terms to the plant, i.e., a higher $x$. The evolutionary or market pressure will drive the exchange rate $x$ towards its maximum feasible value. The upper bound of feasibility for the rhizobia is $x = 1/k_{C}$. At this value, the rhizobia are at their break-even point: all carbon received ($C_{t}$) is respired to fix nitrogen ($C_r = 0$), and all nitrogen fixed ($N_{f}$) is returned to the plant ($N_r = 0$). This corresponds to a zero-growth state for the rhizobia, a standard outcome in models of perfect competition.\nTherefore, the competitive equilibrium exchange rate is the maximum feasible rate:\n$$x^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{k_{C}}$$\nThe problem provides the parameter value $k_{C} = 10$ mol C per mol N fixed. We can now calculate the numerical value of $x^{\\ast}$.\n$$x^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1$$\nThe units of $k_{C}$ are $\\text{mol C}/\\text{mol N}$, so the units of $x^{\\ast}$ are $\\text{mol N}/\\text{mol C}$, as required. Rounding to four significant figures gives $0.1000$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1000}$$", "id": "2522596"}]}
