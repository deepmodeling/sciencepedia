Tagged $\\mathrm{CdvB}$ forms a midcell ring that constricts; the ring is dynamic (FRAP mobile fraction $\\approx 0.6$).\n    2.  Tagged $\\mathrm{FtsZ1}$ or $\\mathrm{FtsZ2}$ do not form midcell rings.\n- **Foundational Principles:**\n    1.  Central Dogma is assumed.\n    2.  Kinetic models: constant velocity leads to linear radius decay ($r(t) \\approx r_0 - v t$); fractional rate leads to exponential decay ($r(t) \\approx r_0 e^{-k t}$).\n    3.  ESCRT-III archaeal system (Cdv): $\\mathrm{CdvB}$ polymers are remodeled by $\\mathrm{CdvC}$ (AAA+ ATPase) for constriction/scission.\n    4.  FtsZ system: tubulin homolog often responsible for division, in some cases leading to linear constriction kinetics.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a coherent set of simulated experimental results that are consistent with known principles of archaeal cell biology. The proteins ($\\mathrm{CdvB}$, $\\mathrm{CdvC}$, $\\mathrm{FtsZ}$, $\\mathrm{SepF}$, $\\mathrm{crenactin}$), experimental techniques (CRISPRi, fluorescence imaging, ATP depletion), and observed phenotypes are all realistic and commonly encountered in modern microbiology research. The data are internally consistent and do not contain contradictions. For example, the genetic requirement for $\\mathrm{CdvB}$ in ring formation is corroborated by direct imaging of tagged $\\mathrm{CdvB}$. The problem is self-contained, providing sufficient information and foundational principles to arrive at a logical conclusion. There are no signs of scientific unsoundness, ambiguity, or triviality.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe task is to identify the operative cell division system and the component that powers the final scission step. This requires a synthesis of the kinetic, genetic, and imaging data.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Constriction Kinetics:**\n    The constriction of the midcell radius, $r(t)$, is well-described by a single-exponential decay, $r(t) \\approx r_0 e^{-kt}$, with a rate constant $k \\approx 0.035\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. This model has a high coefficient of determination ($R^2 \\approx 0.97$), whereas a linear model fits poorly ($R^2 \\approx 0.81$). A key feature of exponential decay is a half-time, $t_{1/2}$, that is independent of the initial value. The relation is $t_{1/2} = \\ln(2)/k$. Using the given rate constant, we predict $t_{1/2} = \\ln(2) / 0.035\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx 0.693 / 0.035\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx 19.8\\,\\mathrm{s}$. This calculated value is in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured value of $t_{1/2} = 20 \\pm 2\\,\\mathrm{s}$. The observation that $t_{1/2}$ does not correlate with the initial cell radius $r_0$ provides strong confirmation for the exponential nature of the constriction process and argues against a linear constriction mechanism, where $t_{1/2}$ would be proportional to $r_0$. According to the provided principles, this kinetic signature corresponds to a fractional-rate shortening mechanism ($dr/dt \\propto -r$), not a constant-velocity one.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Protein Function from Genetic and Imaging Data:**\n    -   **FtsZ/SepF System:** Knockdown of the genes encoding two FtsZ homologs ($\\mathrm{ftsZ1}$, $\\mathrm{ftsZ2}$) and a putative FtsZ-anchoring protein ($\\mathrm{sepF}$) produces no observable phenotype. Furthermore, tagged FtsZ proteins fail to localize into a midcell ring. These results conclusively demonstrate that the FtsZ-based division machinery, common in bacteria and some archaea, is not functional or required for cytokinesis in this organism.\n    -   **Crenactin System:** Knockdown of $\\mathrm{crenactin}$ has minor effects on cell shape but does not impact constriction kinetics or completion. This rules out crenactin as the primary motor for cell division.\n    -   **Cdv (ESCRT-III) System:** This system appears to be central.\n        -   Knockdown of $\\mathrm{cdvB}$ is lethal, preventing the formation of division rings and causing cells to grow as giant spheres. Imaging confirms that a tagged CdvB protein assembles into a midcell ring that constricts. This identifies CdvB as the core structural component of the cytokinetic ring. The high mobile fraction in FRAP experiments suggests the polymer is dynamic and undergoes remodeling during constriction.\n        -   Knockdown of $\\mathrm{cdvC}$ or overexpression of an ATPase-dead mutant $\\mathrm{CdvC^{E\\!Q}}$ does not prevent the initiation of constriction but causes a highly specific arrest at the final step. Cells form stable, narrow intercellular bridges that fail to resolve. This phenotype directly implicates the ATPase activity of CdvC in the terminal event of membrane scission (abscission).\n        -   The experiment with the ATP-synthesis inhibitor CCCP phenocopies the CdvC-inactivation experiments. Depletion of the cellular ATP pool leads to the same late-stage arrest with narrow necks. This confirms that the final scission step is an energy-dependent process requiring ATP hydrolysis, consistent with the function of CdvC as an AAA+ ATPase.\n\n3.  **Synthesis:**\n    The evidence converges on a single, coherent model. Cell division in this methanogen is driven by the archaeal ESCRT-III homolog system, Cdv. The CdvB protein forms a dynamic, constricting ring at the midcell. The constriction process follows exponential kinetics. The final step of membrane scission is an active, ATP-dependent process powered by the remodeling activity of the AAA+ ATPase CdvC. The FtsZ and crenactin systems are not involved in this process.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. A canonical FtsZ-based system in which $\\mathrm{FtsZ2}$ is the primary force-generating filament and $\\mathrm{SepF}$ is essential for anchoring; constriction proceeds with approximately constant $dr/dt$.**\nThis option is **Incorrect**. It is directly contradicted by genetic evidence (knockdown of $\\mathrm{ftsZ2}$ and $\\mathrm{sepF}$ has no phenotype) and imaging evidence (no FtsZ rings are observed). Furthermore, the constriction kinetics are exponential, not linear (constant $dr/dt$).\n\n**B. An ESCRT-III (Cdv) system in which $\\mathrm{CdvB}$ family polymers form the constriction ring and the AAA+ ATPase $\\mathrm{CdvC}$ supplies the remodeling energy for late-stage constriction and scission; constriction follows $r(t) \\propto e^{-k t}$ and abscission fails when $\\mathrm{CdvC}$ activity is impaired.**\nThis option is **Correct**. It accurately summarizes the conclusions drawn from all lines of evidence.\n-   The Cdv system is operative ($\\mathrm{CdvB}$ is essential for the ring, $\\mathrm{CdvC}$ for scission).\n-   $\\mathrm{CdvC}$ is the ATPase powering the late stage (genetic and ATP-depletion data).\n-   Constriction kinetics are exponential ($r(t) \\propto e^{-k t}$).\n-   Abscission failure upon $\\mathrm{CdvC}$ impairment is the observed phenotype.\n\n**C. A hybrid system in which $\\mathrm{FtsZ1}$ positions an ESCRT-III ring that provides the sole constrictive force, so that loss of either $\\mathrm{FtsZ1}$ or $\\mathrm{CdvC}$ yields identical severe phenotypes.**\nThis option is **Incorrect**. The premise that FtsZ1 is involved is false, as $\\mathrm{ftsZ1}$ knockdown has no effect. The claim of identical phenotypes for loss of $\\mathrm{FtsZ1}$ (no phenotype) and $\\mathrm{CdvC}$ (late-stage arrest) is factually wrong.\n\n**D. An actin-like (crenactin) contractile system in which a crenactin ring is the primary constrictor; ESCRT and FtsZ proteins are dispensable for both constriction and scission, and $r(t)$ is expected to be quadratic in $t$ due to filament buckling mechanics.**\nThis option is **Incorrect**. Crenactin is not the primary constrictor (its knockdown does not stop constriction). ESCRT proteins (CdvB, CdvC) are essential, not dispensable. The observed kinetics are exponential, not quadratic.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2474301"}]}
