This practice explores the simplest scenario: two populations that become completely isolated and evolve independently. By applying the foundational principles of the neutral theory of molecular evolution, you will derive the expected genetic divergence as a linear function of time, establishing the \"molecular clock\" that ticks at a rate set by the neutral mutation rate. This exercise is crucial for creating a null model of divergence, quantifying the pace of genetic change driven by drift alone [@problem_id:2505491].", "problem": "A pair of clonally derived bacterial populations becomes completely isolated at generation $0$ by a barrier that eliminates homologous recombination and horizontal gene transfer (gene flow is $0$). Assume that at each nucleotide site, neutral mutations arise as a Poisson process with constant rate $\\mu$ per site per generation. Under the standard neutral theory of molecular evolution, the substitution rate at a site equals the neutral mutation rate. Let $t$ denote the number of generations since isolation, and define the neutral divergence $D(t)$ as the expected number of neutral substitutions per site that have accumulated between the two lineages by generation $t$ (that is, “substitutions per site,” a dimensionless quantity).\n\nStarting only from the fundamental facts that (i) neutral mutations arise with rate $\\mu$ per site per generation in each lineage and (ii) under neutrality the expected rate of fixation equals the neutral mutation rate (molecular clock), derive a closed-form expression for $D(t)$ as a function of $\\mu$ and $t$ for these $2$ isolated microbial lineages. Explicitly state in brief the minimal biological assumptions required for your derivation to hold in the context of microbial speciation.\n\nReport $D(t)$ as a single simplified analytic expression in terms of $\\mu$ and $t$ only. Express the result as substitutions per site (dimensionless). No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the neutral theory of molecular evolution, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is expressed in objective, formal language. It is a fundamental problem in population genetics. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the neutral divergence, $D(t)$, between two lineages that have been isolated for $t$ generations. We shall begin from the fundamental facts provided.\n\nThe core principle, as stated, is that under the neutral theory of molecular evolution, the rate of substitution at a neutral site is equal to the rate of neutral mutation at that site. The problem specifies this mutation rate as $\\mu$ per site per generation. Therefore, the rate of substitution, which we denote as $k$, for any single lineage is:\n$$k = \\mu$$\nThis rate, $k$, represents the expected number of substitutions that become fixed per site, per generation.\n\nNow, consider a single evolutionary lineage. This lineage traces its ancestry back to a common ancestral population at generation $t=0$. The expected number of neutral substitutions that will have accumulated per site along this single lineage after $t$ generations is the product of the constant substitution rate $k$ and the time duration $t$. Let us denote this quantity for one lineage as $d_1(t)$.\n$$d_1(t) = k \\times t = \\mu t$$\n\nThe problem concerns two such lineages, which separated at $t=0$ and have since evolved independently. The divergence $D(t)$ is defined as the expected number of neutral substitutions per site that have accumulated *between* the two lineages by generation $t$. This is the total number of mutational differences per site one would expect to observe when comparing a sequence from lineage $1$ with a sequence from lineage $2$, both sampled at generation $t$.\n\nThese differences are the sum of the substitutions that occurred along the evolutionary path from the common ancestor to lineage $1$, and the substitutions that occurred along the independent evolutionary path from the same common ancestor to lineage $2$. The total time for evolution to occur separating the two lineages is the sum of the lengths of these two branches.\n\nThe evolutionary path for lineage $1$ has a duration of $t$ generations. The expected number of substitutions accumulated on this branch is $\\mu t$.\nThe evolutionary path for lineage $2$ also has a duration of $t$ generations. The expected number of substitutions accumulated on this second branch is also $\\mu t$.\n\nSince the lineages evolve independently following their separation, the total expected number of substitutions per site separating them, $D(t)$, is the sum of the expected substitutions on each branch:\n$$D(t) = (\\text{expected substitutions in lineage 1}) + (\\text{expected substitutions in lineage 2})$$\n$$D(t) = (\\mu t) + (\\mu t)$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression:\n$$D(t) = 2\\mu t$$\nThis quantity is dimensionless, with units of (substitutions/site/generation) $\\times$ (generations) yielding substitutions/site, as required.\n\nThe minimal biological assumptions required for this derivation to hold are as follows:\n$1$. **Neutrality**: All mutations under consideration are selectively neutral. Their fate (fixation or loss) is determined entirely by genetic drift, not by natural selection. This is the foundation of the given premise that the substitution rate equals the mutation rate.\n$2$. **Constant Mutation Rate**: The rate of neutral mutation, $\\mu$, is constant over the time period $t$, across all nucleotide sites being considered, and is identical for both lineages. This is a key component of the molecular clock hypothesis.\n$3$. **Complete Isolation**: The two populations are completely reproductively isolated, meaning there is zero gene flow (e.g., via homologous recombination or horizontal gene transfer) between them. This ensures that the lineages diverge independently without being homogenized by genetic exchange.\n$4$. **Constant Demographic and Evolutionary Processes**: The derivation that the substitution rate equals the mutation rate ($k=\\mu$) assumes a constant effective population size ($N_e$). Although the $N_e$ term cancels in the final expression for the neutral substitution rate, its constancy is an underlying assumption for the process of fixation by drift to be uniform over time.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2\\mu t}$$", "id": "2505491"}, {"introduction": "In nature, microbial populations are rarely perfectly isolated; they are often connected by some degree of migration, or gene flow, which directly counteracts divergence. This exercise delves into the classic tension between genetic drift and gene flow by using the fixation index, $F_{ST}$, a cornerstone of population genetics, to quantify the level of genetic exchange between populations. By deriving and applying the relationship between $F_{ST}$ and the migration rate $m$, you will gain a practical tool for assessing whether populations are effectively diverging or are being homogenized by gene flow [@problem_id:2505476].", "problem": "In a metapopulation of clonally reproducing, haploid marine bacteria inhabiting spatially separated microhabitats (demes) connected by water-mediated dispersal, neutral single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data reveal an among-deme fixation index of $F_{ST} = 0.330$ computed from genome-wide core loci. Independent coalescent-based inference, using temporal sampling and allele frequency trajectories, estimates the harmonic mean effective size per deme as $N_{e} = 5.0 \\times 10^{5}$ individuals. Assume the following:\n- An infinite-island model with symmetric, constant migration at rate $m$ per generation (each lineage migrates out of its deme with probability $m$ per generation).\n- Migration–drift equilibrium at the neutral loci considered.\n- Mutation is negligible on the migration–drift timescale at these loci.\n- Demes have equal size and are exchangeable; selection at the loci used to compute $F_{ST}$ is negligible.\n\nStarting from first principles appropriate to neutral theory in structured populations (for example, reasoning about the fates of lineages under the structured coalescent and definitions of $F$-statistics in terms of identity by descent), derive an expression for the migration rate $m$ in terms of $F_{ST}$ and $N_{e}$ under haploidy, and then compute $m$ for the values above. Round your numerical result to three significant figures and report it as a decimal fraction per generation (dimensionless per generation).\n\nIn your reasoning, briefly interpret the magnitude of the inferred $m$ with respect to the potential for microbial speciation under drift versus the need for ecological or other barriers to maintain divergence. Your final reported answer must be only the computed value of $m$.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the migration rate, $m$, from the fixation index, $F_{ST}$, and the effective population size per deme, $N_e$, under a haploid infinite-island model at migration-drift equilibrium.\n\nWe begin from first principles by considering the probability of identity by descent (IBD) for two gene lineages. Let $F_{ST}$ be defined as the equilibrium probability that two gene copies sampled randomly from the same deme are IBD. We can establish a recurrence relation for this probability by tracing the ancestry of the two lineages one generation into the past.\n\nLet us consider two lineages sampled from a single deme. In a haploid population of effective size $N_e$, the probability that they descend from the same ancestral lineage in the preceding generation (i.e., they coalesce) is $1/N_e$. In this case, they are IBD. With probability $1 - 1/N_e$, they descend from two distinct ancestral lineages. For these two lineages to be IBD, their distinct ancestors must themselves have been IBD.\n\nThe identity of these two distinct ancestral lineages depends on migration. In the infinite-island model, each lineage is a migrant from the general metapopulation with probability $m$, and a non-migrant from the same deme with probability $1-m$.\nThe two ancestral lineages were both non-migrants with probability $(1-m)^2$. If so, they were two random lineages within the same deme in the previous generation, and the probability of them being IBD is, by definition, $F_{ST}$ at equilibrium.\nIf at least one of the ancestral lineages was a migrant (which occurs with probability $1 - (1-m)^2$), then under the infinite-island model, the two ancestors are considered to be drawn from different demes. The probability of IBD between lineages from different demes, relative to the average IBD of the entire metapopulation, is taken to be zero. This is a standard convention in the derivation of this relationship, where $F_{ST}$ measures the excess identity within demes due to drift.\n\nCombining these possibilities, we can write the equilibrium condition ($F_{ST}$ in the current generation equals $F_{ST}$ in the previous generation) as follows:\n$$F_{ST} = \\left( \\frac{1}{N_e} \\right) \\cdot 1 + \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{N_e} \\right) \\left[ (1-m)^2 F_{ST} + (1 - (1-m)^2) \\cdot 0 \\right]$$\n$$F_{ST} = \\frac{1}{N_e} + \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{N_e} \\right) (1-m)^2 F_{ST}$$\n\nWe can now solve this equation for $F_{ST}$:\n$$F_{ST} \\left[ 1 - \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{N_e} \\right) (1-m)^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{N_e}$$\nThis is the exact relationship under the model. In most realistic scenarios, the migration rate $m$ and the reciprocal of the effective population size $1/N_e$ are very small quantities ($m \\ll 1$, $1/N_e \\ll 1$). This allows for a highly accurate approximation by neglecting second-order terms. We approximate $(1-m)^2 \\approx 1-2m$.\n$$F_{ST} \\approx \\frac{1}{N_e} + \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{N_e} \\right) (1-2m) F_{ST}$$\nExpanding the terms in parentheses:\n$$F_{ST} \\approx \\frac{1}{N_e} + \\left( 1 - 2m - \\frac{1}{N_e} + \\frac{2m}{N_e} \\right) F_{ST}$$\nRearranging to solve for $F_{ST}$:\n$$F_{ST} \\left[ 1 - \\left( 1 - 2m - \\frac{1}{N_e} + \\frac{2m}{N_e} \\right) \\right] \\approx \\frac{1}{N_e}$$\n$$F_{ST} \\left( 2m + \\frac{1}{N_e} - \\frac{2m}{N_e} \\right) \\approx \\frac{1}{N_e}$$\nSince $m$ and $1/N_e$ are small, their product $2m/N_e$ is a second-order small term and can be neglected.\n$$F_{ST} \\left( 2m + \\frac{1}{N_e} \\right) \\approx \\frac{1}{N_e}$$\nMultiplying the terms inside the parenthesis by $N_e$:\n$$F_{ST} \\left( \\frac{2N_e m + 1}{N_e} \\right) \\approx \\frac{1}{N_e}$$\nThis simplifies to the well-known approximation for haploids:\n$$F_{ST} \\approx \\frac{1}{2N_e m + 1}$$\nThe problem requires an expression for the migration rate $m$.

This is a dimensionless rate, interpreted as per generation.\n\nThe extremely small value of $m$ justifies the approximations made during the derivation. This value indicates that on average, only about $2$ in a million individuals in a deme are new migrants in any generation.\nA key parameter in assessing the balance between drift and gene flow is the number of effective migrants per generation, $N_e m$.\n$$N_e m = (5.0 \\times 10^5) \\times (2.03 \\times 10^{-6}) \\approx 1.015$$\nA value of $N_e m \\approx 1$ signifies a critical threshold. Genetic drift is strong enough to cause substantial differentiation among demes (as evidenced by $F_{ST} = 0.330$), but gene flow is just sufficient to prevent their complete divergence. For speciation to proceed to completion under these conditions—that is, for demes to become irreversibly distinct evolutionary lineages—this weak but persistent genetic link would likely need to be severed by additional barriers. Such barriers could include the evolution of reproductive isolation or strong divergent ecological selection that acts against migrants or hybrids. Therefore, while drift is a major factor driving divergence in this system, it is unlikely to be sufficient for speciation on its own, given the estimated level of gene flow.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.03 \\times 10^{-6}}$$", "id": "2505476"}, {"introduction": "As lineages diverge, intrinsic barriers to gene flow often arise, cementing their separation into distinct species.

There are $n$ DMIs in total between the two lineages. The event of realizing a single DMI (i.e., the DMI locus being included in the recombined tract) can be modeled as a Bernoulli trial with a success probability of $p = \\ell$.
