A rigorous solution can be constructed.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem is solved in three parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Estimator for the selection coefficient per cycle, $s_{\\mathrm{cyc}}$**\n\nLet $N_A(t)$ and $N_B(t)$ be the absolute abundances of genotypes $A$ and $B$, respectively, at time $t$ within a single growth cycle. The duration of the growth phase of a cycle is $T$. According to the model of exponential growth:\n$$N_A(T) = N_A(0) \\exp(r_A T)$$\n$$N_B(T) = N_B(0) \\exp(r_B T)$$\nwhere $N_A(0)$ and $N_B(0)$ are the abundances at the start of the cycle.\n\nThe frequency of genotype $A$ is $p = \\frac{N_A}{N_A + N_B}$. The odds of genotype $A$ are defined as $O = \\frac{p}{1-p} = \\frac{N_A}{N_B}$.\nLet $p_{n-1}$ be the frequency of genotype $A$ at the start of cycle $n$, and $p_n$ be the frequency at the end of cycle $n$ (before dilution). The corresponding odds are $O_{n-1}$ and $O_n$.\nThe ratio of abundances at the end of the cycle is:\n$$\\frac{N_A(T)}{N_B(T)} = \\frac{N_A(0) \\exp(r_A T)}{N_B(0) \\exp(r_B T)} = \\frac{N_A(0)}{N_B(0)} \\exp((r_A - r_B)T)$$\nIn terms of odds, this is:\n$$O_n = O_{n-1} \\exp((r_A - r_B)T)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives the change in log-odds over one cycle:\n$$\\ln(O_n) = \\ln(O_{n-1}) + (r_A - r_B)T$$\n$$\\ln(O_n) - \\ln(O_{n-1}) = (r_A - r_B)T$$\nThe problem defines the selection coefficient per cycle, $s_{\\mathrm{cyc}}$, as the constant cycle-wise increment in the log-odds. Therefore:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{cyc}} = \\ln(O_n) - \\ln(O_{n-1})$$\nSince dilution is unbiased, it does not change the relative frequencies, so the frequency at the end of a cycle is the same as the frequency at the start of the next cycle. This relationship holds for all cycles.\n\nThis forms an arithmetic progression for the log-odds over $C$ cycles. Let $O_0$ be the odds at the start of cycle $1$ (corresponding to frequency $p_0$) and $O_C$ be the odds at the end of cycle $C$ (corresponding to frequency $p_C$). After $C$ cycles, the total change in log-odds is:\n$$\\ln(O_C) - \\ln(O_0) = \\sum_{n=1}^{C} (\\ln(O_n) - \\ln(O_{n-1})) = C \\cdot s_{\\mathrm{cyc}}$$\nSolving for $s_{\\mathrm{cyc}}$:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{cyc}} = \\frac{1}{C} (\\ln(O_C) - \\ln(O_0))$$\nSubstituting the definition of odds, $O = \\frac{p}{1-p}$:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{cyc}} = \\frac{1}{C} \\left( \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_C}{1-p_C}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_0}{1-p_0}\\right) \\right)$$\nThis can be written as a single logarithm:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{cyc}} = \\frac{1}{C} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_C(1-p_0)}{p_0(1-p_C)}\\right)$$\nThis is the required estimator for $s_{\\mathrm{cyc}}$.\n\n**Part 2: Expression for the selection coefficient per generation, $s_{\\mathrm{gen}}$**\n\nThe selection coefficient per cycle, $s_{\\mathrm{cyc}}$, represents the total change in log-odds over one full cycle. The number of generations that occur within one cycle is given by $G$. The selection coefficient per generation, $s_{\\mathrm{gen}}$, is defined as the constant increment in log-odds per generation.\nAssuming the increment in log-odds is uniform across the generations within a cycle (which is consistent with a constant differential growth rate $r_A - r_B$ over time), the total change over the cycle is the per-generation change multiplied by the number of generations.\n$$s_{\\mathrm{cyc}} = G \\cdot s_{\\mathrm{gen}}$$\nFrom this, we can express $s_{\\mathrm{gen}}$ in terms of $s_{\\mathrm{cyc}}$ and $G$:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{gen}} = \\frac{s_{\\mathrm{cyc}}}{G}$$\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Computation**\n\nWe are given the dataset: $p_{0}=0.001$, $p_{C}=0.5$, $C=12$, and $g=64$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of generations per cycle, $G$:\n$$G = \\frac{\\ln(g)}{\\ln(2)} = \\frac{\\ln(64)}{\\ln(2)} = \\frac{\\ln(2^6)}{\\ln(2)} = \\frac{6 \\ln(2)}{\\ln(2)} = 6$$\n\nNext, we calculate the selection coefficient per cycle, $s_{\\mathrm{cyc}}$:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{cyc}} = \\frac{1}{C} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_C(1-p_0)}{p_0(1-p_C)}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$p_0 = 0.001 \\implies 1-p_0 = 0.999$$\n$$p_C = 0.5 \\implies 1-p_C = 0.5$$\n$$C=12$$\n$$s_{\\mathrm{cyc}} = \\frac{1}{12} \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.5 \\cdot 0.999}{0.001 \\cdot 0.5}\\right) = \\frac{1}{12} \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.999}{0.001}\\right) = \\frac{\\ln(999)}{12}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the selection coefficient per generation, $s_{\\mathrm{gen}}$:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{gen}} = \\frac{s_{\\mathrm{cyc}}}{G} = \\frac{\\ln(999)/12}{6} = \\frac{\\ln(999)}{72}$$\nNow we compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures:\n$$\\ln(999) \\approx 6.90675513$$\n$$s_{\\mathrm{gen}} \\approx \\frac{6.90675513}{72} \\approx 0.09592715458$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{gen}} \\approx 0.09593$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.09593}$$", "id": "2492038"}, {"introduction": "A positive selection coefficient, $s \\gt 0$, indicates a fitness advantage, but it does not guarantee evolutionary success.

The problem states that the number of offspring produced by each mutant individual in the subsequent generation is an independent random variable following a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda = 1+s$, where $s$ is the selective advantage.\n\nThe foundation of analyzing a Galton-Watson process is the probability generating function (PGF) of the offspring distribution. Let $X$ be the random variable for the number of offspring of a single individual. The PGF, $G(x)$, is defined as:\n$$G(x) = E[x^X] = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} P(X=k) x^k$$\nFor a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$, the probability mass function is $P(X=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}$. The PGF is therefore:\n$$G(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!} x^k = e^{-\\lambda} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\lambda x)^k}{k!}$$\nThe sum is the Taylor series for $e^{\\lambda x}$. Thus, the PGF is:\n$$G(x) = e^{-\\lambda} e^{\\lambda x} = \\exp(\\lambda(x-1))$$\nIn this problem, the mean number of offspring is $\\lambda = 1+s$, so the specific PGF is:\n$$G(x) = \\exp((1+s)(x-1))$$\nA fundamental theorem of branching processes states that the probability of ultimate extinction of a lineage starting from a single individual, denoted by $q$, is the smallest non-negative root of the equation $G(x) = x$. We must solve for $q$ in the equation:\n$$\\exp((1+s)(q-1)) = q$$\nThe mean number of offspring is $E[X] = \\lambda = 1+s$. Since $s=0.02 > 0$, the mean is greater than $1$. For a supercritical branching process ($\\lambda > 1$), there are exactly two non-negative fixed points of $G(x)$: one at $x=1$ and another, which is the extinction probability $q$, in the interval $[0, 1)$.\n\nThe equation $\\exp((1+s)(q-1)) = q$ does not have a simple closed-form solution for $q$. However, the problem asks for a leading-order approximation in $s$. For a small positive $s$, the mean offspring number $1+s$ is only slightly above $1$, and the extinction probability $q$ will be close to $1$.\nLet us define the probability of survival as $p_{surv} = 1 - q$. Since $q$ is close to $1$, $p_{surv}$ is a small positive quantity. We can substitute $q = 1 - p_{surv}$ into the fixed-point equation:\n$$\\exp((1+s)((1 - p_{surv}) - 1)) = 1 - p_{surv}$$\n$$\\exp(-(1+s)p_{surv}) = 1 - p_{surv}$$\nWe now perform a Taylor series expansion of the exponential function on the left-hand side around the point $0$, since its argument $-(1+s)p_{surv}$ is small. The expansion is $\\exp(z) \\approx 1 + z + \\frac{z^2}{2!} + O(z^3)$.\n$$1 - (1+s)p_{surv} + \\frac{((1+s)p_{surv})^2}{2} - \\dots \\approx 1 - p_{surv}$$\nSubtracting $1$ from both sides and rearranging, we get:\n$$p_{surv} - (1+s)p_{surv} + \\frac{(1+s)^2 p_{surv}^2}{2} \\approx 0$$\n$$(1 - (1+s))p_{surv} + \\frac{(1+s)^2 p_{surv}^2}{2} \\approx 0$$\n$$-s \\cdot p_{surv} + \\frac{(1+s)^2 p_{surv}^2}{2} \\approx 0$$\nWe are looking for the survival probability, which is non-zero, so we can divide by $p_{surv}$:\n$$-s + \\frac{(1+s)^2 p_{surv}}{2} \\approx 0$$\nSolving for $p_{surv}$:\n$$p_{surv} \\approx \\frac{2s}{(1+s)^2}$$\nThe problem asks for the leading-order approximation in $s$. This means we consider the limit as $s \\to 0$. In this limit, the denominator $(1+s)^2 \\to 1$. Thus, the leading-order approximation for the survival probability is:\n$$p_{surv} \\approx 2s$$\nThe probability of loss, $q$, is then approximated as:\n$$q = 1 - p_{surv} \\approx 1 - 2s$$\nThis is the required leading-order analytic approximation for the probability of loss.\n\nJustification for the independence from $N$: The derivation relies on the Galton-Watson branching process model. This model is applicable under the condition that the mutant population is rare relative to the total population size ($Z_n \\ll N$). In this regime, mutant individuals do not compete with each other for resources, nor do they significantly alter the overall environment. The growth of the mutant lineage is determined solely by the demographic stochasticity of birth and death at the individual level, which is captured by the offspring distribution with mean $1+s$. The total population size $N$ does not appear in the PGF or the resulting equation for the extinction probability because the background of wild-type individuals is treated as an infinite, constant reservoir. The fate of the mutation (extinction or establishment) is decided during this early phase where its absolute number is small. Therefore, the probability of loss depends on the selective advantage $s$ but not on the census size $N$.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the approximation numerically for $s=0.02$:\n$$q \\approx 1 - 2(0.02) = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96$$\nThe leading-order approximation for the probability that the mutation is lost is $0.96$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.96}$$", "id": "2491978"}]}
