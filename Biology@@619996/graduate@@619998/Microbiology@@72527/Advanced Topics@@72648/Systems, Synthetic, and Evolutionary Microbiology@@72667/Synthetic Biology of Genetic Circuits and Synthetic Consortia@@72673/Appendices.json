The activator protein concentration $A$ represents the fast subsystem, while the repressor protein concentration $R$ is the slow subsystem.\n\nFirst, we derive an approximation for the pulse amplitude, which is the peak concentration of $A$, denoted $A_{peak}$. Upon the step input of inducer at $t=0$, the production of $A$ begins. Because the lifetime of $A$ ($\\tau_a = 1.5$ min) is much shorter than the lifetime of $R$ ($\\tau_r = 40$ min), the concentration of $A$ rises very quickly to a quasi-steady state before the concentration of $R$ has had significant time to increase from its initial condition $R(0)=0$.
