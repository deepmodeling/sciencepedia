The solution will proceed.\n\n**Derivation of the Governing Equation**\n\nThe expected readthrough flux, $\\Phi$, is the product of the upstream initiation rate, $r$, and the total survival probability, $P_{\\text{total}}$, of the elongating RNA polymerase (RNAP) complex through the entire insulation region.\nThe total survival probability is the product of the survival probabilities for each independent element in the series: the native terminator, the $N$ engineered terminators, and the spacer of length $L$.\n\n$P_{\\text{total}} = P_{\\text{native}} \\times P_{\\text{engineered}} \\times P_{\\text{spacer}}$\n\n1.  **Survival probability for the native terminator ($P_{\\text{native}}$):**\n    With a termination efficiency of $E_0$, the readthrough (survival) probability is $1 - E_0$.\n    $P_{\\text{native}} = 1 - E_0 = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n\n2.  **Survival probability for the engineered terminators ($P_{\\text{engineered}}$):**\n    There are $N$ identical terminators, each with efficiency $E_t$. The readthrough probability for a single terminator is $1 - E_t$. Since their actions are independent, the total survival probability across $N$ terminators is the product of their individual survival probabilities.\n    $P_{\\text{engineered}} = (1 - E_t)^N = (1 - 0.95)^N = (0.05)^N$.\n\n3.  **Survival probability for the spacer ($P_{\\text{spacer}}$):**\n    The problem states termination along the spacer is a memoryless process with a constant hazard rate $\\lambda$. For a process with a constant hazard rate, the survival probability $S(L)$ over a length $L$ follows an exponential decay law: $S(L) = e^{-\\lambda \\cdot L_{\\text{kb}}}$, where $L_{\\text{kb}}$ is the length in the same units as the inverse of $\\lambda$.\n    The hazard rate is given as $\\lambda = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{kb}^{-1}$.

We must convert $L$ to kilobases (kb) by using the conversion $1\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 1000$ nucleotides.\n    $L_{\\text{kb}} = L / 1000$.\n    Thus, the survival probability through the spacer is:\n    $P_{\\text{spacer}} = e^{-\\lambda (L/1000)} = e^{-1.0 \\times (L/1000)} = e^{-L/1000}$.\n\nCombining these components, the readthrough flux $\\Phi$ for a design with $N$ terminators and a spacer of length $L$ is:\n$$\\Phi(N, L) = r \\cdot P_{\\text{native}} \\cdot P_{\\text{engineered}} \\cdot P_{\\text{spacer}}$$\n$$\\Phi(N, L) = r \\cdot (1 - E_0) \\cdot (1 - E_t)^N \\cdot e^{-L/1000}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\Phi(N, L) = 30 \\cdot (0.10) \\cdot (0.05)^N \\cdot e^{-L/1000}$$\n$$\\Phi(N, L) = 3 \\cdot (0.05)^N \\cdot e^{-L/1000}$$\nThe units of $\\Phi$ are $\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n\nThe design requirement is that this flux must be less than the threshold $\\theta = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$:\n$$\\Phi(N, L)  0.05$$\n$$3 \\cdot (0.05)^N \\cdot e^{-L/1000}  0.05$$\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nEach option will now be evaluated against this inequality.\n\n**A. $N = 1$ engineered terminator; spacer length $L = 500$ nucleotides.**\nFor this design, $N=1$ and $L=500$.\n$$\\Phi(1, 500) = 3 \\cdot (0.05)^1 \\cdot e^{-500/1000} = 3 \\cdot 0.05 \\cdot e^{-0.5}$$\n$$\\Phi(1, 500) = 0.15 \\cdot e^{-0.5} \\approx 0.15 \\cdot 0.6065 = 0.090975\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$$\nWe must check if $0.090975  0.05$.

The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. The assumption regarding negligible phage loss to adsorption is an explicit modeling directive, not a flaw; it leads to a self-consistent, albeit simplified, model. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nWe proceed with the solution.\n\nPart 1: Formulation of the mechanistic model.\nWe construct a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the populations $B(t)$, $I(t)$, and $P(t)$ based on the principles of mass balance.\n\nFor the susceptible bacteria, $B(t)$:\nThe population increases due to logistic growth. As resource limitation is negligible, this is exponential growth. The rate of increase is the per-capita rate $r$ multiplied by the population density $B$, yielding a term $+rB$.\nThe population decreases when bacteria become infected. The rate of infection is given by mass-action kinetics as the product of the densities of phage and bacteria, scaled by the adsorption constant $\\phi$. This gives a loss term $-\\phi P B$.\nThus, the rate of change of susceptible bacteria is:\n$$ \\frac{dB}{dt} = rB - \\phi P B $$\n\nFor the infected bacteria, $I(t)$:\nThis population is created from the pool of susceptible bacteria through infection. The rate of creation is therefore equal to the rate of loss from the susceptible pool, $+\\phi P B$.\nInfected bacteria are removed from the system when they lyse. This is a first-order decay process occurring at a per-capita rate $\\eta$, resulting in a loss term $-\\eta I$. We assume infected cells do not reproduce.\nThus, the rate of change of infected bacteria is:\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dt} = \\phi P B - \\eta I $$\n\nFor the free phage particles, $P(t)$:\nPhage are produced upon the lysis of infected cells. Each lysis event, occurring at a total rate of $\\eta I$, releases on average $\\beta$ new phage particles. This results in a production term $+\\beta \\eta I$.\nPhage are lost from the system due to natural inactivation or decay at a per-capita rate $\\omega$, giving a loss term $-\\omega P$.\nThe problem explicitly states that the loss of free phage due to adsorption onto bacteria is negligible. Therefore, we do not include a $-\\phi P B$ term in this equation.\nThus, the rate of change of free phage is:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = \\beta \\eta I - \\omega P $$\n\nThe complete model is the system of $3$ coupled ODEs:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{dB}{dt} = B(r - \\phi P) \\\\\n\\frac{dI}{dt} = \\phi P B - \\eta I \\\\\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = \\beta \\eta I - \\omega P\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nPart 2: Quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA).\nThe QSSA is applied to the infected class $I(t)$, under the condition that its dynamics are much faster than those of $B(t)$ and $P(t)$. This is justified when the lysis timescale, $1/\\eta$, is very short compared to the other relevant timescales in the system. We set $\\frac{dI}{dt} \\approx 0$.\n$$ \\phi P B - \\eta I \\approx 0 \\implies I_{\\text{qss}} = \\frac{\\phi P B}{\\eta} $$\nThis algebraic expression for $I$ is substituted into the equations for $B$ and $P$.\nThe equation for $B$ is unchanged as it does not depend on $I$:\n$$ \\frac{dB}{dt} = rB - \\phi P B $$\nThe equation for $P$ becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = \\beta \\eta I_{\\text{qss}} - \\omega P = \\beta \\eta \\left(\\frac{\\phi P B}{\\eta}\\right) - \\omega P = \\beta \\phi P B - \\omega P $$\nThe reduced $2$-variable mass-action model for $(B,P)$ is:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{dB}{dt} = B(r - \\phi P) \\\\\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = P(\\beta \\phi B - \\omega)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe validity of this approximation is controlled by the condition that the timescale for the dynamics of $I$, which is of order $1/\\eta$, is much smaller than the timescales of the processes that drive it. These \"slow\" processes are bacterial growth (timescale $1/r$), phage decay (timescale $1/\\omega$), and a change in the infection rate $\\phi PB$ (timescales $1/(\\phi P)$ and $1/(\\phi B)$).\nTherefore, the condition for QSSA validity is that $\\eta$ must be large compared to the characteristic rates of the slow dynamics. A dimensionless small parameter $\\epsilon$ controlling the approximation's validity can be defined as the ratio of the characteristic slow rate to the fast rate $\\eta$:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{\\max(r, \\omega, \\phi P, \\phi B)}{\\eta} \\ll 1 $$\n\nPart 3: Critical bacterial density $B_{\\mathrm{crit}}$.\nWe seek the minimum bacterial density, $B_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, required for a small phage population to grow. This is an invasion analysis. We consider the fate of an infinitesimal perturbation $(I, P)$ introduced into a phage-free environment where bacteria are at a density $B$. The problem statement implies we may treat $B$ as a constant parameter for this initial analysis, as the bacterial population is not yet perturbed by the low density of phage.\n\nWe analyze the stability of the phage-free state $(I, P) = (0, 0)$ using the full $3$-variable model for rigor. The dynamics of small perturbations of $I$ and $P$ are governed by the linearized system:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\begin{pmatrix} I \\\\ P \\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial I}(\\phi PB - \\eta I)  \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P}(\\phi PB - \\eta I) \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial I}(\\beta \\eta I - \\omega P)  \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P}(\\beta \\eta I - \\omega P)\n\\end{pmatrix}_{\\substack{I=0 \\\\ P=0}}\n\\begin{pmatrix} I \\\\ P \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe Jacobian matrix evaluated at the phage-free state is:\n$$ J = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\eta  \\phi B \\\\ \\beta \\eta  -\\omega \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe phage population will grow if the system is unstable, which occurs if at least one eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of $J$ has a positive real part. The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(J - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}) = 0$:\n$$ (-\\eta - \\lambda)(-\\omega - \\lambda) - (\\phi B)(\\beta \\eta) = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 + (\\eta + \\omega)\\lambda + \\eta\\omega - \\beta\\eta\\phi B = 0 $$\nFor a $2 \\times 2$ system, stability requires that the trace of the Jacobian be negative and the determinant be positive.\nThe trace is $\\text{Tr}(J) = -\\eta - \\omega$. Since $\\eta  0$ and $\\omega  0$, the trace is always negative.\nThe determinant is $\\det(J) = (-\\eta)(-\\omega) - (\\phi B)(\\beta \\eta) = \\eta\\omega - \\beta\\eta\\phi B$.\nThe transition from stability (phage die out) to instability (phage grow) occurs when the largest real part of an eigenvalue becomes positive. This transition happens when $\\det(J)$ changes sign from positive to negative. The critical condition is $\\det(J) = 0$.\n$$ \\eta\\omega - \\beta\\eta\\phi B_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 0 $$\nSince $\\eta  0$, we can divide by it:\n$$ \\omega - \\beta\\phi B_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 0 $$\nSolving for $B_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ yields the expression:\n$$ B_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{\\omega}{\\beta \\phi} $$\nThis critical density is the threshold above which the effective phage production rate, which is proportional to $\\beta \\phi B$, surpasses the phage loss rate $\\omega$, leading to net positive growth of the phage population. This result is independent of the lysis rate $\\eta$ and the bacterial growth rate $r$. The same result is obtained directly from the QSSA-reduced model, by finding the condition for $\\frac{1}{P}\\frac{dP}{dt}  0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\omega}{\\beta \\phi}}$$", "id": "2477431"}]}
