It presents a standard model in bioinformatics for genome sequencing coverage. All necessary parameters are provided, and the required derivations are based on fundamental principles of probability theory. Thus, I will proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of two quantities from first principles: the expected sequencing depth (coverage) and the probability of a base being uncovered.\n\nFirst, let us define the parameters provided:\n- The genome length is $G = 4.6 \\times 10^{6}$ base pairs.\n- The read length is $L = 150$ base pairs.\n- The number of sequenced reads is $N = 153{,}334$.\n\nThe model assumes that read start positions are independent and uniformly distributed across the circular genome.\n\n**1. Derivation of Expected Sequencing Depth ($\\lambda$)**\n\nLet us consider an arbitrary, fixed base on the genome. For this base to be covered by a single read of length $L$, the read's starting position must fall within a specific window of length $L$ \"upstream\" of the base. Due to the circular nature of the genome, the total number of possible start positions is $G$. The length of the interval of start positions that result in coverage of our chosen base is $L$.\n\nTherefore, the probability, $p$, that a single, randomly placed read covers our chosen base is the ratio of the length of the favorable region to the total genome length:\n$$p = \\frac{L}{G}$$\n\nNow, let us define a Bernoulli indicator random variable, $I_i$, for each read $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, N\\}$. This variable takes the value $1$ if read $i$ covers the fixed base, and $0$ otherwise.\n$$I_i = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if read } i \\text{ covers the base} \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\nThe probability of success for this Bernoulli trial is $P(I_i=1) = p = \\frac{L}{G}$. The expected value of this indicator variable is $E[I_i] = 1 \\cdot P(I_i=1) + 0 \\cdot P(I_i=0) = p$.\n\nThe total coverage depth, $C$, at the specific base is the total number of reads that cover it. This is the sum of the indicator variables for all $N$ reads:\n$$C = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} I_i$$\nThe expected sequencing depth, which we shall denote by $\\lambda$, is the expected value of $C$. By the linearity of expectation, we have:\n$$\\lambda = E[C] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} I_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[I_i]$$\nSince the reads are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), the expectation $E[I_i]$ is the same for all $i$. Thus:\n$$\\lambda = N \\cdot E[I_1] = N \\cdot p = \\frac{NL}{G}$$\nThis expression gives the expected coverage at any randomly selected base.\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{153{,}334 \\times 150}{4.6 \\times 10^{6}} = \\frac{23{,}000{,}100}{4{,}600{,}000} \\approx 5.000021739$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the expected coverage is $5.000$. This is a dimensionless quantity, representing the average number of times a base is sequenced, often referred to as \"fold coverage\".\n\n**2. Derivation of the Probability of a Base Being Uncovered**\n\nThe problem specifies that we must use the Binomial-to-Poisson limit. The coverage count $C = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} I_i$ is a sum of $N$ i.i.d. Bernoulli trials. Therefore, $C$ follows a Binomial distribution, $C \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N, p)$.\nThe probability mass function (PMF) is given by:\n$$P(C=k) = \\binom{N}{k} p^k (1-p)^{N-k}$$\nThe Poisson approximation to the Binomial distribution is valid when $N$ is large, $p$ is small, and their product $\\lambda = Np$ is a finite, moderate value. Let us verify these conditions:\n- $N = 153{,}334$ is large.\n- $p = \\frac{L}{G} = \\frac{150}{4.6 \\times 10^6} \\approx 3.26 \\times 10^{-5}$ is small.\n- $\\lambda = Np \\approx 5.000$ is a moderate constant.\n\nThe conditions are satisfied. Thus, we can approximate the Binomial distribution of the coverage count $C$ with a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda = \\frac{NL}{G}$.\n$$P(C=k) \\approx \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^k}{k!}$$\nThe probability that a randomly chosen base is uncovered is the probability that its coverage count is zero, i.e., $P(C=0)$.\nUsing the Poisson PMF with $k=0$:\n$$P(C=0) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^0}{0!}$$\nSince $\\lambda^0 = 1$ and $0! = 1$, this simplifies to:\n$$P(C=0) = e^{-\\lambda}$$\nUsing the previously calculated value for $\\lambda$:\n$$P(C=0) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{NL}{G}\\right) \\approx \\exp(-5.000021739)$$\n$$P(C=0) \\approx 0.00673780$$\nRounding this probability to four significant figures, we get $0.006738$.\n\nIn summary:\nThe expected coverage is $\\lambda = \\frac{NL}{G} \\approx 5.000021739$, which rounds to $5.000$.\nThe probability of zero coverage is $e^{-\\lambda} \\approx 0.00673780$, which rounds to $0.006738$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 5.000 & 0.006738 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2479969"}, {"introduction": "Assembling millions of short sequence reads into a contiguous and accurate genome is a cornerstone of modern microbiology, often involving sophisticated machine learning models.

Contiguity, measured by metrics like $N50$ and $NG50$, reflects how well short contigs have been joined into longer sequences. An aggressive scaffolding algorithm may propose many links between contigs, increasing the length of the resulting scaffolds and thus improving $N50/NG50$. However, this aggression increases the risk of making incorrect joins, or misassemblies. An increase in misassemblies elevates the misassembly rate $r$, which signifies a decrease in accuracy. Therefore, striving for maximum contiguity can compromise accuracy, and conversely, a conservative approach to avoid misassemblies may result in a more fragmented assembly with lower contiguity. The pair of metrics $(N50, r)$ or $(NG50, r)$ quantitatively captures this duality.\nThe difference between $N50$ and $NG50$ arises from their normalization base. $N50$ is an internal quality measure, relative to the size of the assembly itself ($\\sum \\ell_i$). $NG50$ is an external measure, relative to an independent estimate of the genome size ($G$). When an assembly is incomplete, as in this case where $\\sum \\ell_i = 5{,}070{,}000 < G = 6{,}400{,}000$, the threshold for $N50$ ($\\frac{1}{2}\\sum \\ell_i$) is lower than for $NG50$ ($\\frac{G}{2}$). Consequently, a smaller cumulative sum of contig lengths is required to reach the $N50$ threshold, which can lead to $N50 \\ge NG50$, as observed here ($540{,}000 > 480{,}000$).\n\nTask 4: Compute the composite quality index $Q$.\nFirst, we calculate the contiguity score $S_c$ and the accuracy score $S_a$.\nThe contiguity score $S_c$ is defined as:\n$$\nS_c = \\frac{N50 + NG50}{2G} = \\frac{540{,}000 + 480{,}000}{2 \\times 6{,}400{,}000} = \\frac{1{,}020{,}000}{12{,}800{,}000} = \\frac{102}{1280} = \\frac{51}{640}\n$$\nNumerically, $S_c = 0.0796875$.\n\nThe accuracy score $S_a$ is defined as $1 - r$:\n$$\nS_a = 1 - r = 1 - \\frac{10{,}850}{5{,}070{,}000} = \\frac{5{,}070{,}000 - 10{,}850}{5{,}070{,}000} = \\frac{5{,}059{,}150}{5{,}070{,}000} = \\frac{101183}{101400}\n$$\nNumerically, $S_a \\approx 0.9978609467$.\n\nFinally, the composite quality index $Q$ is the harmonic mean of $S_c$ and $S_a$:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{S_c} + \\frac{1}{S_a}} = \\frac{2S_c S_a}{S_c + S_a}\n$$\nSubstituting the fractional values:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{2}{\\frac{640}{51} + \\frac{101400}{101183}}\n$$\nWe proceed with a numerical calculation:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{2}{12.5490196\\dots + 1.0021446\\dots} = \\frac{2}{13.5511642\\dots} \\approx 0.1475880\n$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures, as required, we get:\n$$\nQ \\approx 0.1476\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.1476}\n$$", "id": "2479883"}, {"introduction": "Once genomes are assembled, we can compare them to uncover the evolutionary forces that shape microbial life.

[@problem_id:2479914]", "problem": "You are given a gene family present in multiple bacterial strains. For each gene, an alignment across strains has been analyzed to count the observed nonsynonymous substitutions and synonymous substitutions, and to estimate the number of nonsynonymous sites and synonymous sites (opportunities) based on codon structure. Assume the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, where codons in Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) encode amino acids, and that nonsynonymous substitutions change the encoded amino acid whereas synonymous substitutions do not. Under a homogeneous, time-reversible nucleotide substitution process with equal base frequencies and equal substitution rates between all nucleotides, the Jukes–Cantor model from year $1969$ provides a correction for multiple hits at the same site.

It is a well-posed exercise in quantitative molecular evolution, grounded in the established, albeit simplified, theoretical framework of Nei–Gojobori and Jukes–Cantor. The problem statement is self-contained, logically consistent, and free of scientific or factual unsoundness. We shall proceed with its systematic solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates, $\\omega$, and to classify the mode of natural selection acting on a gene. This is achieved by following a precise algorithmic procedure for each test case, which is a tuple of counts and sites $(x_N, x_S, n_N, n_S)$.\n\nThe calculation proceeds in four distinct steps:\n\nFirst, we estimate the proportion of nonsynonymous differences, $\\hat{p}_N$, and the proportion of synonymous differences, $\\hat{p}_S$, from the raw counts. The provided counts are the number of observed nonsynonymous substitutions, $x_N$, the number of observed synonymous substitutions, $x_S$, the total number of available nonsynonymous sites, $n_N$, and the total number of available synonymous sites, $n_S$. To avoid issues with proportions of $0$ or $1$, especially when counts are small, a Haldane–Anscombe continuity correction is applied. This is a standard procedure for robustly estimating binomial proportions. The corrected proportions are:\n$$\n\\hat{p}_N = \\frac{x_N + 0.5}{n_N + 1}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{p}_S = \\frac{x_S + 0.5}{n_S + 1}\n$$\n\nSecond, we correct these observed proportions for multiple substitutions that may have occurred at the same site over evolutionary time but are unobservable in a pairwise sequence comparison. The Jukes–Cantor model of $1969$, assuming equal nucleotide frequencies and substitution rates, provides a logarithmic correction. The evolutionary distance, or the estimated number of substitutions per site, is calculated separately for the nonsynonymous ($d_N$) and synonymous ($d_S$) categories:\n$$\nd_N = -\\frac{3}{4}\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{4}{3}\\hat{p}_N\\right)\n$$\n$$\nd_S = -\\frac{3}{4}\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{4}{3}\\hat{p}_S\\right)\n$$\nA critical constraint of the Jukes–Cantor model is that the argument of the natural logarithm, $\\ln$, must be positive. This implies that $1 - \\frac{4}{3}\\hat{p} > 0$, which simplifies to $\\hat{p} < \\frac{3}{4}$. If for any category, the estimated proportion $\\hat{p}$ is greater than or equal to this saturation threshold of $\\frac{3}{4}$, the distance is formally undefined. The problem dictates a numerical stabilization procedure: cap such a proportion to a value negligibly smaller than $\\frac{3}{4}$ to ensure the computation can proceed. This is a pragmatic, though artificial, solution to the model's limitation.\n\nThird, we compute the ratio $\\omega = d_N/d_S$. This ratio is a fundamental measure in molecular evolution, representing the relative rate of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions. It serves as an indicator of the selective pressure acting on the protein-coding gene. An $\\omega$ ratio of $1$ suggests that nonsynonymous mutations are fixed at the same rate as synonymous (neutral) mutations. A ratio less than $1$ implies that nonsynonymous mutations are deleterious and are removed by purifying selection. A ratio greater than $1$ indicates that nonsynonymous mutations are advantageous and are being fixed by positive (Darwinian) selection.\n\nFourth, we classify the selection regime based on the value of $\\omega$. Using the specified symmetric tolerance parameter $\\tau = 0.1$, we define three distinct regimes:\n- Purifying selection: if $\\omega \\leq 1 - \\tau$, which is $\\omega \\leq 0.9$. A regime code of $-1$ is assigned.\n- Neutral evolution: if $1 - \\tau < \\omega < 1 + \\tau$, which is $0.9 < \\omega < 1.1$. A regime code of $0$ is assigned.\n- Positive selection: if $\\omega \\geq 1 + \\tau$, which is $\\omega \\geq 1.1$. A regime code of $+1$ is assigned.\n\nThis complete procedure will be implemented and applied to each of the $5$ test cases provided. The final result for each case will be a list containing the rounded values of $\\omega$, $d_N$, $d_S$, and the integer regime code $r$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to process test cases and print results.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case is a tuple (x_N, x_S, n_N, n_S).\n    test_cases = [\n        (12, 25, 5000, 1500),\n        (80, 5, 4000, 2000),\n        (30, 10, 3000, 1000),\n        (0, 0, 500, 500),\n        (14, 10, 20, 300),\n    ]\n\n    # The tolerance parameter for defining selection regimes.\n    tau = 0.1\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        result = calculate_selection_regime(case, tau)\n        results.append(result)\n\n    # Final print statement must produce a single line: a list of lists.\n    # The str() representation of a list of lists matches the required format.\n    print(str(results).replace(\" \", \"\"))\n\n\ndef calculate_selection_regime(case, tau):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates dN, dS, omega, and the selection regime for a single case.\n\n    Args:\n        case (tuple): A tuple containing (x_N, x_S, n_N, n_S).\n        tau (float): The tolerance parameter for regime classification.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of the form [omega, d_N, d_S, r], where floats are\n              rounded to 6 decimal places.\n    \"\"\"\n    x_N, x_S, n_N, n_S = case\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate proportions with Haldane-Anscombe continuity correction.\n    p_N_hat = (x_N + 0.5) / (n_N + 1)\n    p_S_hat = (x_S + 0.5) / (n_S + 1)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate Jukes-Cantor corrected distances.\n    # First, handle numerical stability by capping proportions if necessary.\n    # The Jukes-Cantor correction is undefined for p >= 3/4.\n    p_cap_limit = 3.0 / 4.0\n    epsilon = 1e-9 # A negligible margin for capping\n\n    if p_N_hat >= p_cap_limit:\n        p_N_hat = p_cap_limit - epsilon\n    \n    if p_S_hat >= p_cap_limit:\n        p_S_hat = p_cap_limit - epsilon\n\n    # Calculate dN and dS.
