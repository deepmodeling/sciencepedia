This practice explores this concept in the context of focal-adhesion-based gliding, where a cell moves by intermittently engaging and translocating adhesins.

Assume the following widely accepted bases: (i) when an adhesin is engaged with the substrate and slip at the adhesin–substrate interface is negligible, the cell’s instantaneous translation speed relative to the substrate equals the magnitude of the adhesin’s rearward translocation speed relative to the cell; (ii) when adhesins are disengaged, no external traction is transmitted and the cell does not translate; (iii) the duty ratio is defined as the fraction of time adhesins are engaged and capable of transmitting traction, with values in the interval $[0,1]$; and (iv) the long-time average speed is the time-average of the instantaneous speed, consistent with $v = dx/dt$ and time-averaging over repeated engagement–disengagement cycles.\n\nIn a steady regime, the adhesin rearward translocation speed relative to the cell is $3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and the duty ratio for adhesive engagement is $0.5$.

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a rigorous solution is developed.\n\nThe long-time average speed, $\\langle v_{cell} \\rangle$, is defined by the time-average of the instantaneous speed, $v_{cell}(t)$, over a total time interval $T$ that is large compared to the characteristic timescale of engagement-disengagement cycles.

During a total time $T_{engaged}$ within the interval $T$, the cell is engaged and moves with speed $v_{cell}(t) = v_{adhesin}$. During the remaining time, $T_{disengaged} = T - T_{engaged}$, the cell is disengaged and its speed is $v_{cell}(t) = 0$. The integral for the total distance traveled can be decomposed according to these two states, which simplifies because the velocity is piecewise constant:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{T} v_{cell}(t) \\, dt = (v_{adhesin} \\cdot T_{engaged}) + (0 \\cdot T_{disengaged}) = v_{adhesin} \\cdot T_{engaged} $$\nSubstituting this result into the definition of the average speed provides:\n$$ \\langle v_{cell} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{T} (v_{adhesin} \\cdot T_{engaged}) $$\nThis expression can be rearranged as:\n$$ \\langle v_{cell} \\rangle = v_{adhesin} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{T_{engaged}}{T} \\right) $$\nBy definition, the duty ratio $D$ is the fraction of time the system is engaged, such that $D = \\frac{T_{engaged}}{T}$. Therefore, we derive the general relationship between the average speed, the instantaneous engaged speed, and the duty ratio:\n$$ \\langle v_{cell} \\rangle = v_{adhesin} \\cdot D $$\nThis is a fundamental formula for the average speed of any system exhibiting such binary on-off dynamics.

We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested: derivation of the minimal front speed $c^{\\ast}$, numerical evaluation of $c^{\\ast}$ and the ratio, and the final computation.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the minimal front speed $c^{\\ast}$.\nWe begin with the Fisher-KPP equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} = D\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} n}{\\partial x^{2}} + r\\, n \\left(1 - \\frac{n}{K}\\right)\n$$\nWe seek a traveling wave solution of the form $n(x,t) = f(z)$, where $z = x - ct$. This represents a wave profile $f(z)$ moving with a constant speed $c$ in the positive $x$ direction. We must find the partial derivatives of $n(x,t)$ with respect to $t$ and $x$ in terms of the new coordinate $z$.\nUsing the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} = \\frac{df}{dz} \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} = -c f'(z)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x} = \\frac{df}{dz} \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x} = f'(z)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} n}{\\partial x^{2}} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(f'(z)\\right) = \\frac{d(f'(z))}{dz} \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x} = f''(z)\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the partial differential equation transforms it into an ordinary differential equation for $f(z)$:\n$$\n-c f'(z) = D f''(z) + r f(z) \\left(1 - \\frac{f(z)}{K}\\right)\n$$\nRearranging gives:\n$$\nD f'' + c f' + r f \\left(1 - \\frac{f}{K}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThe problem specifies a front connecting the state $n=0$ to $n=K$. For a wave invading the region of $n=0$, the boundary conditions on $f(z)$ are:\n$$\nf(z) \\to K \\text{ as } z \\to -\\infty \\quad (\\text{behind the front})\n$$\n$$\nf(z) \\to 0 \\text{ as } z \\to +\\infty \\quad (\\text{ahead of the front})\n$$\nThe minimal speed of a *monotone* front is determined by the behavior at the leading edge of the front, where $z \\to +\\infty$ and thus $f(z) \\to 0$. In this limit, the term $f/K$ is negligible compared to $1$, so the nonlinear logistic term $r f (1 - f/K)$ can be linearized to $r f$. The ODE simplifies to:\n$$\nD f'' + c f' + r f = 0\n$$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients. We assume a solution of the form $f(z) \\propto \\exp(-\\lambda z)$. For the solution to decay to zero as $z \\to +\\infty$, we require $\\lambda > 0$.

The existence of real roots requires the discriminant to be non-negative:\n$$\nc^2 - 4Dr \\geq 0\n$$\nThis implies $c^2 \\geq 4Dr$. Since the speed $c$ must be positive for an invasion front, we have:\n$$\nc \\geq \\sqrt{4Dr} = 2\\sqrt{Dr}\n$$\nThis inequality establishes that there is a minimum possible speed for traveling wave solutions of this type. If $c < 2\\sqrt{Dr}$, $\\lambda$ becomes complex, leading to solutions that oscillate, which violates the physical assumption of a monotone (non-negative) density profile. The minimal speed for a monotone front, denoted $c^{\\ast}$, is therefore achieved when the discriminant is exactly zero.\n$$\nc^{\\ast} = 2\\sqrt{Dr}\n$$\nThis is the well-known Fisher speed.\n\nPart 2: Numerical evaluation of $c^{\\ast}$ and the ratio.\nWe are given the parameter values:\n$D = 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}$\n$r = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\nWe substitute these into the derived expression for $c^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nc^{\\ast} = 2\\sqrt{(10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}) \\times (0.02\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})} = 2\\sqrt{2 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}^{2}}\n$$\n$$\nc^{\\ast} = 2 \\times \\sqrt{2} \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{cm}/\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nTo compare this with the measured speed, we must convert both speeds to a common set of units, for instance, micrometers per second ($\\mathrm{\\mu m}/\\mathrm{s}$).\nFirst, convert the predicted speed $c^{\\ast}$:\n$1\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$\n$$\nc^{\\ast} = (2\\sqrt{2} \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{cm}/\\mathrm{s}) \\times (10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}/\\mathrm{cm}) = 2\\sqrt{2}\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}/\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nNext, convert the measured speed $v_{\\text{meas}}$:\n$v_{\\text{meas}} = 180\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}/\\mathrm{min}$\n$1\\,\\mathrm{min} = 60\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n$$\nv_{\\text{meas}} = \\frac{180\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}}{60\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 3\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}/\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nNow we compute the dimensionless ratio $\\text{ratio} = v_{\\text{meas}}/c^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\text{ratio} = \\frac{3\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}/\\mathrm{s}}{2\\sqrt{2}\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}/\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{3}{2\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nTo obtain the numerical value, we use the approximation $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41421356$:\n$$\n\\text{ratio} = \\frac{3}{2 \\times 1.41421356} = \\frac{3}{2.82842712} \\approx 1.06066017\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final ratio to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\text{ratio} \\approx 1.061\n$$\nThis result indicates that the measured front speed is approximately $6.1\\%$ faster than the minimum speed predicted by the simple Fisher-KPP model.
