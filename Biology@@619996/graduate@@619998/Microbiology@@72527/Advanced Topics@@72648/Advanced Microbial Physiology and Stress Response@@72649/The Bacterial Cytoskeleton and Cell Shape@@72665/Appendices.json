The task is to derive specific physical quantities and use them for a quantitative estimation, which is a standard procedure in biophysical modeling. The problem is therefore deemed valid. We shall proceed with its solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle to be applied is the conservation of area. The rate at which new peptidoglycan (PG) area is synthesized must equal the rate at which the area of the open septal hole decreases.\n\nFirst, we establish the total rate of PG area synthesis. There are $M$ synthases, and each completes a catalytic cycle in a mean time of $\\tau_{c}$. The rate of cycles per synthase is thus $\\frac{1}{\\tau_{c}}$. With $M$ synthases operating independently, the total number of catalytic cycles per unit time is $\\frac{M}{\\tau_{c}}$. Each cycle contributes an area $s$. Therefore, the total rate of area synthesis is:\n$$ \\frac{dA_{\\text{synth}}}{dt} = \\frac{M s}{\\tau_{c}} $$\nThis rate is constant under the given assumptions.\n\nNext, we consider the geometry of the closing septum. The open septal area is a circle of instantaneous radius $r(t)$, so its area is $A(t) = \\pi r(t)^{2}$.

The rate of synthesis of new PG must equal the rate of decrease of the open area. Thus, we have:\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = - \\frac{dA_{\\text{synth}}}{dt} = - \\frac{M s}{\\tau_{c}} $$\nEquating the two expressions for $\\frac{dA}{dt}$ gives:\n$$ 2\\pi r \\frac{dr}{dt} = - \\frac{M s}{\\tau_{c}} $$\nSolving for the instantaneous septal closure speed, $\\dot{r}(r) = \\frac{dr}{dt}$, we obtain the first required expression:\n$$ \\dot{r}(r) = -\\frac{M s}{2\\pi \\tau_{c} r} $$\nThe negative sign correctly indicates that the radius is decreasing over time.
