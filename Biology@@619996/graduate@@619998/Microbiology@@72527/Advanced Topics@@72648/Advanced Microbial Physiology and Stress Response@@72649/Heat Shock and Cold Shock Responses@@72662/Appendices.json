Consider a variant in which $2$ uridines in the SD-masking segment of the hairpin stem are mutated to cytidines.

Upon heating, the hairpin melts, the SD sequence becomes accessible, and translation is initiated.\n- **Mutation:** A variant is created in which $2$ uridines (U) in the SD-masking segment of the hairpin stem are mutated to cytidines (C).\n- **Stated Principles:**\n    1.  **Translation Initiation:** Initiation in bacteria requires pairing between the anti-SD sequence in the $16\\mathrm{S}$ ribosomal RNA and the SD sequence on the messenger RNA. Masking the SD sequence reduces the initiation rate, $k_{\\mathrm{init}}$, by lowering the probability of the SD being accessible.\n    2.  **Base-Pairing Energetics:** Guanine–cytosine (G–C) pairs possess $3$ hydrogen bonds and are stronger than adenine–uridine (A–U) pairs, which have $2$ hydrogen bonds. Wobble G–U pairs are weaker than both G–C and A–U pairs.\n    3.  **Hairpin Thermodynamics:** For an RNA hairpin with a free energy difference $\\Delta G$ between its folded and unfolded states, the probability of the unfolded (SD-exposed) state increases with temperature $T$. This probability decreases as the folded state is stabilized (i.e., $\\Delta G$ becomes more negative). The melting temperature, $T_m$, at which half of the hairpins are unfolded, increases with base-pair stability.\n- **Conditions for Evaluation:** The effect of the U$\\rightarrow$C mutation is to be predicted at $30\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ (non-heat-shock) and $42\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ (heat-shock).\n- **Question:** Predict the qualitative effect of the mutation on translational output at both temperatures and on the effective activation threshold temperature.\n\n**Step 2: Validation of the Problem Statement**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The description of an RNA thermometer, the role of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the principles of translation initiation, and the relative stabilities of RNA base pairs (G–C vs. A–U vs. G–U) are all fundamental and correct concepts in molecular biology and biophysics. The FourU class of thermometers is a known example where G–U wobble pairs in the stem are critical for its temperature-sensing function.\n- **Well-Posed and Self-Contained:** The problem provides a specific mutation (U$\\rightarrow$C) and a clear set of established principles from which to deduce the consequences. The question is unambiguous and asks for a qualitative prediction, which is appropriate given the provided information. The context implies that the uridines in the SD-masking segment of a FourU thermometer are likely paired with guanines from the SD sequence, forming G-U wobble pairs. The mutation would thus change these to G-C pairs. This is a standard and logical interpretation.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is phrased in precise, technical language, free from subjective or speculative claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem statement is valid. There are no scientific flaws, ambiguities, or missing information that would preclude a rigorous solution. I will proceed with the derivation.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding how the U$\\rightarrow$C mutation affects the stability of the RNA hairpin.\n\n1.  **Effect of Mutation on Hairpin Stability:** The problem describes a FourU RNA thermometer. This class is characterized by a stretch of uridines in the $5^{\\prime}$ region that forms the \"SD-masking segment\" of the hairpin by pairing with the purine-rich SD sequence. A common SD sequence is `AAGGAGGU`, and the pairing often involves G–U wobble pairs. The problem states that $2$ uridines in this stem segment are mutated to cytidines (U$\\rightarrow$C). The most logical pairing partner for these uridines would be guanines (G) from the SD sequence, forming G–U wobble pairs in the wild-type structure. The mutation U$\\rightarrow$C therefore replaces these G–U pairs with guanine-cytosine (G–C) pairs.\n\n2.  **Energetic Consequences:** According to the provided principles, a G–C pair, having $3$ hydrogen bonds, is significantly more stable than a G–U wobble pair. The replacement of $2$ weaker G–U pairs with $2$ stronger G–C pairs substantially increases the overall thermodynamic stability of the hairpin stem. This corresponds to a more negative Gibbs free energy of folding, $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$.\n\n3.  **Effect on Melting Temperature ($T_m$) and Activation Threshold:** The melting temperature, $T_m$, is the temperature at which the hairpin is half-melted. According to the principles given, $T_m$ increases when base-pair stability increases. Since the mutant hairpin is more stable, its $T_m$ will be higher than that of the wild-type. The \"activation threshold\" is functionally related to $T_m$; it is the temperature range over which the hairpin melts to permit translation. A higher $T_m$ directly implies that the activation threshold is shifted to a higher temperature.\n\n4.  **Effect on Translational Output:** Translational output is proportional to the initiation rate $k_{\\mathrm{init}}$, which is in turn proportional to the probability that the SD sequence is accessible, $P_{\\text{unfolded}}$. The equilibrium between the folded (SD-sequestered) and unfolded (SD-accessible) states is governed by the relation $P_{\\text{unfolded}} / P_{\\text{folded}} = \\exp(-\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}} / RT)$, where $R$ is the gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n    - Because the mutation makes $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ more negative, the equilibrium at any given temperature $T$ is shifted further toward the folded state for the mutant compared to the wild-type. Thus, $P_{\\text{unfolded, mutant}} < P_{\\text{unfolded, wild-type}}$ at any temperature where the hairpin is not fully melted.\n    - **At $30\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ (non-heat-shock):** This is a low temperature where the wild-type hairpin is already predominantly folded, causing low translational output. The mutant hairpin is even more stable, so it will be even more folded. The accessibility of the SD sequence, and thus the translational output, will be even lower for the mutant than for the wild-type.\n    - **At $42\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ (heat-shock):** This temperature is sufficient to melt a significant fraction of the wild-type hairpins, leading to high translational output. However, since the mutant hairpin has a higher $T_m$, the temperature of $42\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ may no longer be sufficient to induce a comparable level of melting. The fraction of unfolded hairpins in the mutant population at $42\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ will be lower than in the wild-type population at the same temperature. Consequently, the translational output for the mutant will also be lower than for the wild-type at $42\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation:** The U$\\rightarrow$C mutation leads to a more stable hairpin, an increase in $T_m$, a shift of the activation threshold to higher temperatures, and a reduction in translational output at both $30\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ and $42\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ relative to the wild-type.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Translational output is higher at both $30\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ and $42\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ because replacing U with C weakens the hairpin by disrupting A–U pairs, lowering $T_m$.**\n    This statement is flawed in its premise. The mutation strengthens, not weakens, the hairpin by replacing G–U pairs with G–C pairs. The conclusion of higher output and lower $T_m$ is therefore incorrect.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B. Translational output is lower at $30\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ but higher at $42\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ because C disrupts U-rich stacking, lowering $T_m$ and shifting activation to lower temperature.**\n    This statement's reasoning is physically unsound. The dominant effect is the change in hydrogen bonding, which strengthens the hairpin. The notion of \"disrupting U-rich stacking\" is speculative and secondary to the creation of G-C pairs. The conclusion that $T_m$ is lowered is incorrect, as is the prediction for translational output at $42\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Translational output is lower at both $30\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ and $42\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$, and the activation threshold is shifted to higher temperature, because U$\\rightarrow$C enables stronger G–C pairing to the SD-masking region, raising $T_m$ and keeping the SD sequestered.**\n    This statement correctly identifies that the U$\\rightarrow$C mutation enables stronger G–C pairing, which stabilizes the hairpin and raises its $T_m$. This stabilization leads to a shift in the activation threshold to a higher temperature. As a consequence, at any given temperature (including both $30\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ and $42\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$), a smaller fraction of hairpins will be melted in the mutant compared to the wild-type, resulting in lower translational output. This reasoning is entirely consistent with the derivation from first principles.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **D. No significant change in translational output or activation threshold, because FourU thermosensing depends only on total hairpin length, not base composition.**\n    This statement relies on a false premise. The stability of any nucleic acid secondary structure, including an RNA hairpin, is fundamentally dependent on its base composition, with G–C pairs contributing more stability than A–U or G–U pairs. The idea that sensing depends only on length is a gross oversimplification and scientifically incorrect.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2499212"}, {"introduction": "Beyond direct physical sensors, the heat shock response is governed by a sophisticated protein-based regulatory network.

Occupancy refers to the fraction of Hsf1 that is bound, which is $1-A$. Half-occupancy means that the fraction of bound Hsf1 is $1/2$, which implies the fraction of active Hsf1, $A$, is also $1/2$.

Consider a minimal kinetic scheme for the fate of a single polypeptide chain immediately after ClpB has extracted a segment from an aggregate. Let the aggregate be denoted by state $A$, the free unfolded chain by $U$, and the native state by $N$. The relevant kinetic steps after extraction are:\n\n- From $U$, spontaneous productive folding to $N$ occurs with first-order rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{fold}}$.\n- From $U$, reaggregation to $A$ occurs with an effective first-order rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{agg}}^\\ast$ (a pseudo-first-order rate incorporating the abundance of available aggregate interfaces).\n- From $U$, binding to DnaK (concentration $C_{\\text{DnaK}}$) occurs with second-order rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ to form a DnaK-bound complex $U\\cdot\\text{DnaK}$ that does not reaggregate while bound and routes to $N$ with an effective first-order rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{fold}}^\\mathrm{K}$; unbinding from DnaK occurs with first-order rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$.\n\nAssume the following limiting conditions for the partitioning analysis: (i) the ClpB extraction step is not rate-limiting relative to the subsequent fates of $U$; (ii) once $U$ is bound by DnaK, reaggregation is negligible; (iii) in the assistance-dominated regime $k_{\\mathrm{fold}}^\\mathrm{K} \\gg k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, so capture by DnaK is effectively a one-way commitment to a productive pathway.

Proceeding to solution.\n\nThe problem reduces to analyzing the kinetic partitioning of the unfolded state $U$ into three possible fates.

Capture by DnaK, leading to the native state $N$: $U \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{on}}C_{\\text{DnaK}}} N$\n\nThe third pathway is a simplification based on the given assumptions. The initial step is second-order, $U + \\text{DnaK} \\rightarrow U\\cdot\\text{DnaK}$, with a pseudo-first-order rate of $k_{\\mathrm{on}}C_{\\text{DnaK}}$. The subsequent fate of $U\\cdot\\text{DnaK}$ is assumed to be exclusively productive folding to $N$ because $k_{\\mathrm{fold}}^\\mathrm{K} \\gg k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ and reaggregation from this state is negligible. Therefore, the rate of capture by DnaK, $k_{\\mathrm{on}}C_{\\text{DnaK}}$, represents an additional rate of productive flux towards $N$.\n\nThe total rate of consumption of the unfolded state $U$ is the sum of the rates of all competing pathways:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{total}} = k_{\\mathrm{fold}} + k_{\\mathrm{agg}}^\\ast + k_{\\mathrm{on}}C_{\\text{DnaK}}$$\n\nThe pathways leading to a productive outcome (the native state $N$) are spontaneous folding and DnaK-assisted folding. The total rate for productive outcomes is:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{productive}} = k_{\\mathrm{fold}} + k_{\\mathrm{on}}C_{\\text{DnaK}}$$\n\nFor competing first-order reactions, the probability of the system following a particular path is the ratio of the rate of that path to the total rate of all paths. Thus, the probability of achieving the native state, $P_N$, as a function of the DnaK concentration $C_{\\text{DnaK}}$, is:\n$$P_N(C_{\\text{DnaK}}) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{productive}}}{k_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{fold}} + k_{\\mathrm{on}}C_{\\text{DnaK}}}{k_{\\mathrm{fold}} + k_{\\mathrm{agg}}^\\ast + k_{\\mathrm{on}}C_{\\text{DnaK}}}$$\n\nFirst, let us examine the case without DnaK, i.e., $C_{\\text{DnaK}}=0$:\n$$P_N(0) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{fold}}}{k_{\\mathrm{fold}} + k_{\\mathrm{agg}}^\\ast} = \\frac{0.1\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}}{0.1\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} + 10\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}} = \\frac{0.1}{10.1} \\approx 0.0099$$\nThis corresponds to a yield of native protein of less than $1\\%$. The vast majority of chains ($>99\\%$) reaggregate because the rate of aggregation ($k_{\\mathrm{agg}}^\\ast = 10\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$) is $100$ times faster than the rate of spontaneous folding ($k_{\\mathrm{fold}} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$). This demonstrates that ClpB-mediated disaggregation alone is unproductive under these conditions, and a cooperating factor is required.\n\nThe objective is to find the minimum concentration $C_{\\text{DnaK}}$ such that the yield is at least $90\\%$, i.e., $P_N(C_{\\text{DnaK}}) \\ge 0.9$.\n$$\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{fold}} + k_{\\mathrm{on}}C_{\\text{DnaK}}}{k_{\\mathrm{fold}} + k_{\\mathrm{agg}}^\\ast + k_{\\mathrm{on}}C_{\\text{DnaK}}} \\ge 0.9$$\nWe solve for $C_{\\text{DnaK}}$:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{fold}} + k_{\\mathrm{on}}C_{\\text{DnaK}} \\ge 0.9 (k_{\\mathrm{fold}} + k_{\\mathrm{agg}}^\\ast + k_{\\mathrm{on}}C_{\\text{DnaK}})$$\n$$k_{\\mathrm{fold}} + k_{\\mathrm{on}}C_{\\text{DnaK}} \\ge 0.9 k_{\\mathrm{fold}} + 0.9 k_{\\mathrm{agg}}^\\ast + 0.9 k_{\\mathrm{on}}C_{\\text{DnaK}}$$\n$$(1 - 0.9) k_{\\mathrm{on}}C_{\\text{DnaK}} \\ge 0.9 k_{\\mathrm{agg}}^\\ast - (1 - 0.9) k_{\\mathrm{fold}}$$\n$$0.1 k_{\\mathrm{on}}C_{\\text{DnaK}} \\ge 0.9 k_{\\mathrm{agg}}^\\ast - 0.1 k_{\\mathrm{fold}}$$\nMultiplying by $10$:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{on}}C_{\\text{DnaK}} \\ge 9 k_{\\mathrm{agg}}^\\ast - k_{\\mathrm{fold}}$$\n$$C_{\\text{DnaK}} \\ge \\frac{9 k_{\\mathrm{agg}}^\\ast - k_{\\mathrm{fold}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$C_{\\text{DnaK}} \\ge \\frac{9(10\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) - 0.1\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}}{10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}s^{-1}}}$$\n$$C_{\\text{DnaK}} \\ge \\frac{90 - 0.1}{10^{6}} \\frac{\\mathrm{s^{-1}}}{\\mathrm{M^{-1}s^{-1}}}$$\n$$C_{\\text{DnaK}} \\ge \\frac{89.9}{10^{6}} \\,\\mathrm{M}$$\n$$C_{\\text{DnaK}} \\ge 89.9 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{M} = 8.99 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}$$\nThis minimal concentration is approximately $9.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}$ or $90\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. In a competing-exponential model for the immediate fate of $U$, the probability of productive folding in the presence of DnaK is $P_{N}(C_{\\text{DnaK}}) = \\dfrac{k_{\\mathrm{fold}} + k_{\\mathrm{on}}C_{\\text{DnaK}}}{k_{\\mathrm{agg}}^\\ast + k_{\\mathrm{fold}} + k_{\\mathrm{on}}C_{\\text{DnaK}}}$. Therefore, to ensure $P_{N} \\ge 0.9$, one needs $C_{\\text{DnaK}} \\ge \\dfrac{9\\,k_{\\mathrm{agg}}^\\ast - k_{\\mathrm{fold}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}$; with the given values, $C_{\\text{DnaK}} \\approx 9.0\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}$. This shows that when $k_{\\mathrm{agg}}^\\ast \\gg k_{\\mathrm{fold}}$, ClpB alone is nonproductive because most extracted chains reaggregate, whereas DnaK shifts the kinetic partitioning by sequestering $U$ and accelerating a productive route to $N$.**\n- The formula for $P_N(C_{\\text{DnaK}})$ is identical to our derived expression. It correctly identifies both spontaneous folding and DnaK capture as productive pathways.\n- The inequality for the minimal concentration $C_{\\text{DnaK}}$ is identical to our derived expression.\n- The calculated numerical value $C_{\\text{DnaK}} \\approx 9.0\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}$ matches our calculation of $8.99 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\n- The qualitative justification is correct. We calculated that without DnaK, the yield is less than $1\\%$ because $k_{\\mathrm{agg}}^\\ast \\gg k_{\\mathrm{fold}}$. DnaK provides a rapid alternative productive pathway ($k_{\\mathrm{on}}C_{\\text{DnaK}}$) that successfully competes with aggregation, thus \"shifting the kinetic partitioning\".\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Extraction by ClpB is rate-limiting for native yield; as $k_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\to \\infty$, the native yield approaches $1$ even without DnaK. Thus DnaK is dispensable, and the threshold $C_{\\text{DnaK}}$ is $0$.**\n- This statement directly contradicts assumption (i) of the problem, which states the ClpB extraction step is *not* rate-limiting. Furthermore, it fundamentally misunderstands kinetic partitioning. The rate of supply of $U$ does not determine its subsequent fate. Even if $U$ were supplied infinitely fast, the ratio of rates $k_{\\mathrm{fold}} / (k_{\\mathrm{fold}} + k_{\\mathrm{agg}}^\\ast)$ would still govern the yield in the absence of DnaK. As calculated, this yield is minuscule ($\\approx 1\\%$), not $100\\%$. DnaK is demonstrably indispensable under these conditions.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. DnaK alters the thermodynamic stability of $N$ so that $N$ is favored at equilibrium over $A$, making refolding spontaneous; the minimal DnaK concentration is $C_{\\text{DnaK}} \\ge \\dfrac{9}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}} = 9.0\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{M}$.**\n- The primary reasoning is flawed. Chaperones are kinetic facilitators; they do not alter the free energy difference between the unfolded and native states of the substrate protein itself. They prevent off-pathway reactions like aggregation. The problem is explicitly one of kinetics, not thermodynamics.\n- The provided formula for $C_{\\text{DnaK}}$ is dimensionally inconsistent. The numerator $9$ is dimensionless, while the denominator $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ has units of $\\mathrm{M^{-1}s^{-1}}$, resulting in units of $\\mathrm{M \\cdot s}$ for $C_{\\text{DnaK}}$, which is not concentration. The derived numerical value is also incorrect by an order of magnitude.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Because DnaK binds $U$, it traps $U$ away from the folding pathway and thus decreases the native yield according to $P_{N}(C_{\\text{DnaK}}) = \\dfrac{k_{\\mathrm{fold}}}{k_{\\mathrm{agg}}^\\ast + k_{\\mathrm{fold}} + k_{\\mathrm{on}}C_{\\text{DnaK}}}$, implying that to achieve $P_{N} \\ge 0.9$, $C_{\\text{DnaK}}$ should be made as small as possible.**\n- This statement reverses the role of DnaK as described in the problem. Assumption (iii) and the text explicitly state that the DnaK-bound state $U\\cdot\\text{DnaK}$ is a productive intermediate that \"routes to $N$\". Therefore, DnaK binding *increases* the total productive flux, it does not decrease it.\n- The given formula for $P_N(C_{\\text{DnaK}})$ incorrectly treats DnaK binding as a non-productive sink, competing with folding. This contradicts the provided model. According to this flawed formula, increasing $C_{\\text{DnaK}}$ would always decrease the yield, which is biologically and contextually incorrect.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2499157"}]}
