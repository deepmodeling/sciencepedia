It is therefore deemed **valid**. A solution will be developed.\n\nThe problem asks to begin from the thermodynamic definition of osmotic pressure. The chemical potential of a pure solvent at temperature $T$ and pressure $P$ is denoted $\\mu_0^*(T, P)$. In an ideal solution, the chemical potential of the solvent is reduced by the presence of solute particles and is given by:\n$$\n\\mu_0(T, P, x_0) = \\mu_0^*(T, P) + RT \\ln(x_0)\n$$\nwhere $x_0$ is the mole fraction of the solvent, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nOsmotic pressure, $\\Pi$, is defined as the excess mechanical pressure that must be applied to a solution to bring its solvent chemical potential to the level of the pure solvent at the same temperature and a reference pressure $P_0$. At equilibrium, where there is no net flow of solvent across the semipermeable membrane:\n$$\n\\mu_0^*(T, P_0) = \\mu_0(T, P_0 + \\Pi, x_0) = \\mu_0^*(T, P_0 + \\Pi) + RT \\ln(x_0)\n$$\nThe pressure dependence of the chemical potential for a pure substance is given by $(\\partial \\mu_0^* / \\partial P)_T = \\bar{V}_0$, where $\\bar{V}_0$ is the molar volume of the pure solvent. Assuming the solvent is incompressible ($\\bar{V}_0$ is constant), integrating from $P_0$ to $P_0 + \\Pi$ yields:\n$$\n\\mu_0^*(T, P_0 + \\Pi) - \\mu_0^*(T, P_0) = \\int_{P_0}^{P_0+\\Pi} \\bar{V}_0 dP = \\bar{V}_0 \\Pi\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the equilibrium condition gives:\n$$\n\\mu_0^*(T, P_0) = [\\mu_0^*(T, P_0) + \\bar{V}_0 \\Pi] + RT \\ln(x_0)\n$$\n$$\n-\\bar{V}_0 \\Pi = RT \\ln(x_0)\n$$\nFor a dilute solution, the total mole fraction of all solute species, $\\sum x_s$, is small. The solvent mole fraction is $x_0 = 1 - \\sum x_s$.

This volume is approximately equal to the total volume of the solution, $V$, for dilute solutions.\n$$\n\\frac{V_0}{n_0} \\Pi \\approx RT \\frac{\\sum n_s}{n_0} \\implies V_0 \\Pi \\approx RT \\sum n_s\n$$\n$$\n\\Pi \\approx \\frac{\\sum n_s}{V} RT\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{\\sum n_s}{V}$ is the total molar concentration of all solute particles, which is the osmolarity, $C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$. For a solute with molar concentration $C$ that dissociates into $i$ particles, its contribution to osmolarity is $iC$. Thus, we arrive at the van 't Hoff equation:\n$$\n\\Pi = C_{\\mathrm{osm}} RT = iCRT\n$$\nThis expression gives the osmotic pressure of a single solution relative to a pure solvent. The problem concerns the osmotic pressure difference, $\\Delta \\Pi = \\Pi_{\\mathrm{out}} - \\Pi_{\\mathrm{in}}$, between two solutions. The net water flow is driven by the difference in water potential, which, in the absence of hydrostatic pressure differences, is determined by the difference in osmotic pressures.\n$$\n\\Pi_{\\mathrm{out}} = i_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} C_{\\mathrm{out}} RT\n$$\n$$\n\\Pi_{\\mathrm{in}} = i_{\\mathrm{comp}} C_{\\mathrm{in}} RT\n$$\nThe requested expression for the osmotic pressure difference is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Pi = \\Pi_{\\mathrm{out}} - \\Pi_{\\mathrm{in}} = (i_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} C_{\\mathrm{out}} - i_{\\mathrm{comp}} C_{\\mathrm{in}}) RT\n$$\nThis expression relates the pressure difference to the difference in effective osmolarities, $\\Delta C_{\\mathrm{osm}} = i_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} C_{\\mathrm{out}} - i_{\\mathrm{comp}} C_{\\mathrm{in}}$, and fundamental constants.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value. First, we calculate the osmolarity difference.\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{osm, out}} = i_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} C_{\\mathrm{out}} = (2) \\times (0.6\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1}) = 1.2\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{osm, in}} = i_{\\mathrm{comp}} C_{\\mathrm{in}} = (1) \\times (0.3\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1}) = 0.3\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1}\n$$\nThe difference in osmolarity is:\n$$\n\\Delta C_{\\mathrm{osm}} = C_{\\mathrm{osm, out}} - C_{\\mathrm{osm, in}} = 1.2\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1} - 0.3\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1} = 0.9\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1}\n$$\nFor calculation with physically consistent units, the concentration must be converted to the base SI unit of $\\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$.

It is a standard, well-posed problem in biophysics that can be solved from first principles as requested. I will now proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe derivation begins from a force balance on a hemisphere of the spherical cell. Under a uniform internal turgor pressure $\\Delta P$, there is an upward force acting on the circular cross-section of the hemisphere. This force, $F_P$, is given by the pressure multiplied by the area of the disk:\n$$F_P = \\Delta P \\cdot \\pi R^2$$\nThis force must be balanced by the tensile force within the cell wall material acting along the circumference of the cut. This restoring force, $F_{\\sigma}$, is the product of the in-plane membrane stress, $\\sigma$, the circumference of the shell, $2\\pi R$, and the wall thickness, $t$:\n$$F_{\\sigma} = \\sigma \\cdot (2\\pi R) t$$\nIn mechanical equilibrium, these forces must be equal:\n$$F_P = F_{\\sigma}$$\n$$\\Delta P \\cdot \\pi R^2 = \\sigma \\cdot 2\\pi R t$$\nSolving for the membrane stress $\\sigma$ gives:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{\\Delta P \\cdot \\pi R^2}{2\\pi R t} = \\frac{\\Delta P R}{2t}$$\nDue to the spherical symmetry, the membrane stress is isotropic in the tangential plane; that is, the hoop stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ and the meridional stress $\\sigma_{\\phi}$ are equal: $\\sigma_{\\theta} = \\sigma_{\\phi} = \\sigma$.\n\nThe problem states to assume linear isotropic elasticity under a plane stress condition. The plane stress assumption implies that the stress component normal to the surface, the radial stress $\\sigma_r$, is negligible compared to the in-plane stresses, which is valid for a thin shell. The stress-strain relationship (Hooke's Law) for a general biaxial stress state is given by:\n$$\\epsilon_{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{E} (\\sigma_{\\theta} - \\nu \\sigma_{\\phi})$$\n$$\\epsilon_{\\phi} = \\frac{1}{E} (\\sigma_{\\phi} - \\nu \\sigma_{\\theta})$$\nSince $\\sigma_{\\theta} = \\sigma_{\\phi} = \\sigma$, the circumferential (hoop) strain $\\epsilon_{\\theta}$ and meridional strain $\\epsilon_{\\phi}$ are also equal. Let us denote the uniform in-plane strain as $\\epsilon$:\n$$\\epsilon = \\epsilon_{\\theta} = \\epsilon_{\\phi} = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma - \\nu \\sigma) = \\frac{\\sigma}{E}(1 - \\nu)$$\nThis expression relates the in-plane strain to the in-plane stress. Substituting our previously derived expression for $\\sigma$:\n$$\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{E} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta P R}{2t} \\right) (1 - \\nu)$$\nThis is the required relation between the turgor pressure $\\Delta P$ and the circumferential strain $\\epsilon$.\n\nNext, we must find the fractional area strain, $\\Delta A / A$. The surface area of the sphere is $A = 4\\pi R^2$. A small change in radius, $dR$, results in a change in area, $dA$. Using calculus, for small changes:\n$$dA = \\frac{dA}{dR} dR = (8\\pi R) dR$$\nThe fractional change in area is therefore:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta A}{A} \\approx \\frac{dA}{A} = \\frac{8\\pi R dR}{4\\pi R^2} = 2 \\frac{dR}{R}$$\nThe quantity $dR/R$ is the definition of the circumferential (or hoop) strain, $\\epsilon$.

The response can be divided into two phases: an immediate physical response (water efflux and plasmolysis) and a slower physiological recovery phase (solute accumulation).\n\n**1. Initial State and Immediate Plasmolysis:**\n- Initially, the external osmolality is $\\Pi_{ext, initial} = 0.3$ Osm.\n- The relation between osmotic pressure difference and turgor is $P_{turgor} = (\\Pi_{in} - \\Pi_{ext})RT$, where $R$ is the ideal gas constant and T is the absolute temperature.\n- $T = 37 + 273.15 = 310.15$ K.\n- $P_{turgor} = 0.5$ MPa corresponds to an osmotic concentration difference of $\\Delta C = P_{turgor} / (RT) = (0.5 \\times 10^6 \\text{ Pa}) / (8.314 \\text{ J mol}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1} \\times 310.15 \\text{ K}) \\approx 194 \\text{ mol m}^{-3} \\approx 0.2$ Osm.\n- Therefore, the initial internal osmolality is $\\Pi_{in, initial} \\approx \\Pi_{ext, initial} + \\Delta C = 0.3 \\text{ Osm} + 0.2 \\text{ Osm} = 0.5$ Osm.\n- The total number of osmotically active solutes inside the cell is $N_{solute, initial} = \\Pi_{in, initial} \\times V_{initial} = (0.5 \\text{ osmol L}^{-1}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ L}) = 0.5 \\times 10^{-15}$ osmoles, or $0.5$ femto-osmoles (f-osmol).\n- Upon the osmotic upshift to $\\Pi_{ext, final} = 0.9$ Osm, water rapidly leaves the cell. The cell shrinks until the internal osmolality equals the external osmolality, causing turgor pressure to drop to zero.\n- The new, shrunken volume is $V_{plasmolyzed} = N_{solute, initial} / \\Pi_{ext, final} = (0.5 \\text{ f-osmol}) / (0.9 \\text{ osmol L}^{-1}) \\approx 0.56$ fL. The cell volume decreases to about $56\\%$ of its original value, a state of severe plasmolysis.\n\n**2. Turgor Recovery Phase:**\n- To recover, the cell must accumulate solutes to increase its internal osmolarity, which will draw water back in, restore volume, and rebuild turgor. The main solute accumulated is potassium, with glutamate synthesized as the primary counter-ion.\n- To restore the original volume ($V_{initial} = 1.0$ fL) and the original turgor ($P_{turgor} = 0.5$ MPa, corresponding to a $\\Delta C = 0.2$ Osm pressure head), the final internal osmolality must reach $\\Pi_{in, final} = \\Pi_{ext, final} + 0.2 \\text{ Osm} = 0.9 \\text{ Osm} + 0.2 \\text{ Osm} = 1.1$ Osm.\n- The required total number of internal solutes for full recovery is $N_{solute, final} = \\Pi_{in, final} \\times V_{initial} = (1.1 \\text{ osmol L}^{-1}) \\times (1.0 \\text{ fL}) = 1.1$ f-osmol.\n- The net amount of solute that needs to be accumulated is $\\Delta N_{solute} = N_{solute, final} - N_{solute, initial} = 1.1 \\text{ f-osmol} - 0.5 \\text{ f-osmol} = 0.6$ f-osmol.\n\n**3. Rate of Solute Accumulation:**\n- With Trk and Kdp systems disabled, solute accumulation depends solely on the Kup transporter for potassium uptake.\n- The rate of potassium uptake via Kup follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics: $V = V_{max} \\frac{[S]}{K_m + [S]}$, where $[S] = [\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{out}} = 10$ mM.\n- $V_{Kup} = (0.005 \\text{ fmol min}^{-1}) \\times \\frac{10 \\text{ mM}}{20 \\text{ mM} + 10 \\text{ mM}} = (0.005) \\times \\frac{10}{30} = \\frac{0.005}{3} \\approx 0.00167$ fmol $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ min$^{-1}$ cell$^{-1}$.\n- For each $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ion imported, the cell synthesizes a glutamate molecule to maintain charge neutrality. Thus, the import of one $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ion results in the accumulation of two osmotically active particles (one $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ and one glutamate$^{-}$).\n- Rate of osmolyte accumulation = $2 \\times V_{Kup} \\approx 2 \\times 0.00167 = 0.00334$ f-osmol min$^{-1}$ cell$^{-1}$.\n- The time required for full recovery is: Time = $\\frac{\\Delta N_{solute}}{\\text{Rate}} = \\frac{0.6 \\text{ f-osmol}}{0.00334 \\text{ f-osmol min}^{-1}} \\approx 180$ minutes ($3$ hours).\n\n**4. State after 60 minutes:**\n- In the first $60$ minutes, the total amount of accumulated solute is $(0.00334 \\text{ f-osmol min}^{-1}) \\times 60 \\text{ min} \\approx 0.2$ f-osmol.\n- The total internal solute content after $60$ minutes is $N_{solute, 60min} = N_{solute, initial} + 0.2 \\text{ f-osmol} = 0.5 + 0.2 = 0.7$ f-osmol.\n- Since this solute is contained within a cell in an environment of $0.9$ Osm, the internal osmolality cannot exceed the external one until solute accumulation is sufficient. With an internal content of $0.7$ f-osmol, the maximum possible internal osmolality at the original volume would be $0.7$ Osm, which is less than the external $0.9$ Osm.\n- This means that after $60$ minutes, the cell is still plasmolyzed with zero turgor pressure. Turgor is essential for cell expansion and division, so growth is arrested.\n\n**5. Other Physiological Consequences:**\n- **Sodium:** The external medium contains $0.3$ M NaCl. The intense inward gradient for $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ is counteracted by the active $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}/\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ antiporter NhaA, which keeps $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{in}}$ below $10$ mM. Thus, $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ does not contribute significantly to osmolyte accumulation.\n- **Cytoplasmic pH:** The continuous activity of NhaA expelling $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ involves the import of $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ ions. This proton influx will lead to a drop in cytoplasmic pH (acidification).\n- **Membrane Potential:** To maximize the driving force for the electrogenic uptake of positive $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ions through the Kup uniport channel, the cell will increase the activity of its respiratory chain proton pumps. This enhances proton extrusion, making the cytoplasmic membrane potential more negative, a phenomenon known as hyperpolarization.\n- **Growth:** Without turgor pressure, cell growth and division are arrested.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Rapid recovery of turgor within approximately 5 to 10 minutes due to sufficient residual potassium influx through Kup, near-normal volume recovery, and continued growth without major perturbations to ion homeostasis.**\nMy calculations show recovery would take approximately $180$ minutes. A timeframe of $5$ to $10$ minutes is incorrect by more than an order of magnitude. The potassium influx through Kup is insufficient. Consequently, turgor is not recovered, and growth is arrested.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Sustained plasmolysis with near-zero turgor for most of the first hour because Kup-mediated potassium influx is too slow to supply the osmotically required solute; intracellular sodium remains low due to active extrusion, the membrane potential becomes more negative (hyperpolarized), the cytoplasm acidifies transiently from sodium/proton antiport activity, and growth is arrested unless an external compatible solute is provided.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with the derived analysis. Kup is too slow, leading to sustained plasmolysis (near-zero turgor) and arrested growth. The descriptions of low intracellular sodium (due to NhaA), membrane hyperpolarization (to drive $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ uptake), and cytoplasmic acidification (a consequence of $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}/\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ antiport) are all correct physiological consequences.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Immediate cell swelling and lysis because the inability to import potassium prevents regulation of water entry during the osmotic upshift.**\nAn osmotic *upshift* (hyperosmotic shock) causes water to exit the cell, leading to shrinkage (plasmolysis). Swelling and lysis occur during a hypo-osmotic shock. This option describes the wrong physical phenomenon.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Restoration of turgor primarily by intracellular sodium accumulation in place of potassium, enabling maintained growth despite defects in Trk and Kdp, with only minor changes in membrane potential and cytoplasmic pH.**\nThis is contradicted by the problem statement, which specifies that the NhaA antiporter actively maintains intracellular sodium at a low level ($<10$ mM). Therefore, $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ cannot be the primary osmolyte for turgor restoration. As growth is arrested and major changes in membrane potential and pH are expected, this option is incorrect on multiple points.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2516639"}]}
