It is a valid application of principles from thermodynamics and continuum mechanics to a problem in cellular biophysics. We begin by analyzing the problem from first principles.\n\nFirst, we determine the change in turgor pressure, $\\Delta P$, resulting from the hyperosmotic upshift. The van’t Hoff relation for osmotic pressure $\\Pi$ in a dilute ideal solution is given by $\\Pi = C R T$, where $C$ is the molar concentration of solute, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. An upshift in the external solute concentration by $\\Delta C$ causes an increase in the external osmotic pressure by $\\Delta \\Pi_{ext} = (\\Delta C) R T$. In the immediate quasi-static response, before the cell can adjust its internal solute concentration, this leads to an equal and opposite change in the hydrostatic turgor pressure, $P$. Therefore, the change in turgor pressure is:\n$$\n\\Delta P = - \\Delta \\Pi_{ext} = - (\\Delta C) R T\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates a reduction in turgor pressure. We must ensure consistent units. The concentration is given as $\\Delta C = 0.3\\ \\mathrm{M}$, which is $0.3\\ \\mathrm{mol/L}$. We must convert this to SI units of $\\mathrm{mol/m^3}$:\n$$\n\\Delta C = 0.3\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\times \\frac{1000\\ \\mathrm{L}}{1\\ \\mathrm{m^3}} = 300\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{m^3}}\n$$\nWe use $R = 8.314\\ \\mathrm{J/(mol \\cdot K)}$ and $T = 310\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n\nNext, we relate this pressure change to the change in stresses within the bacterial cell wall (sacculus). The bacterium is modeled as a thin-walled cylinder of radius $r$ and thickness $t$. For a pressurized thin-walled cylinder, the circumferential (hoop) stress, $\\sigma_{\\theta}$, and the axial (longitudinal) stress, $\\sigma_{z}$, are given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\theta} = \\frac{Pr}{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{z} = \\frac{Pr}{2t}\n$$\nSince these relations are linear in pressure $P$, the changes in stress, $\\Delta \\sigma_{\\theta}$ and $\\Delta \\sigma_{z}$, due to a change in pressure $\\Delta P$ are:\n$$\n\\Delta \\sigma_{\\theta} = \\frac{(\\Delta P)r}{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\sigma_{z} = \\frac{(\\Delta P)r}{2t}\n$$\n\nThe sacculus is treated as an isotropic linear elastic material.

The output is $y(t) = x_{N}(t)$. The input is a unit impulse, $u(t) = \\delta(t)$, so the output $y(t)$ is the impulse response, denoted $h_{N}(t)$.\n\nWe employ the Laplace transform method to analyze this linear time-invariant system. Let $X_{i}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{x_{i}(t)\\}$ be the Laplace transform of the state variable $x_{i}(t)$, and $U(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\}$.

The fact that $\\tau_3 > \\tau_1$ indicates that the three-step phosphorelay has a significantly longer mean response time than the direct two-component system. The impulse response of the $N=1$ system, $h_1(t) = k\\exp(-kt)$, is an immediate, exponentially decaying function. In contrast, the impulse response for the $N=3$ system, $h_3(t) = \\frac{1}{2}k^3 t^2 \\exp(-kt)$, exhibits a delay, starting at zero, peaking at time $t_{peak} = (3-1)/k = 2/k$, and decaying more slowly. This longer response time and initial delay mean that the phosphorelay system integrates the input signal over a longer time window. It is therefore less sensitive to brief, transient fluctuations in stress (high-frequency noise) and responds more robustly only to sustained signals. The phosphorelay architecture thus implements a temporal filter that increases the fidelity of the signaling response by rejecting spurious inputs, a critical feature for making reliable cellular decisions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2}{k}}\n$$", "id": "2481444"}, {"introduction": "The culmination of many stress signaling cascades is a sweeping change in the cell's transcriptional program.

A correct experimental design must isolate the contribution of each pathway. This is a classic problem of genetic interaction, and its transcriptomic analysis (epistasis analysis) requires a specific factorial design. The minimal set of genotypes required to analyze two components ($A$ and $B$) is the wild type (WT, active A, active B), two single mutants ($\\Delta a$, inactive A, active B; $\\Delta b$, active A, inactive B), and a double mutant ($\\Delta a \\Delta b$, inactive A, inactive B). For each genotype, a comparison between the stressed and unstressed state is necessary to isolate the response to the stimulus from baseline genetic effects.\n\nThe problem correctly specifies that deleting the essential gene `rpoE` (encoding $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{E}}$) is not a viable strategy. Instead, one must delete components required for its activation. `degS` is the canonical choice, as it is the sensor protease that initiates the degradation of the anti-sigma factor RseA, leading to $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{E}}$ activation. A $\\Delta degS$ mutant is viable but fails to activate the $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{E}}$ response to envelope stress. Similarly, to block the Cpx pathway, one must eliminate a core component. Deleting the response regulator `cpxR` is the most direct method to abolish transcriptional output from the pathway. A $\\Delta cpxR$ mutant is viable.\n\nTherefore, the ideal genetic framework involves four genotypes: WT, $\\Delta degS$, $\\Delta cpxR$, and the double mutant $\\Delta degS\\, \\Delta cpxR$.

Use an interaction term to confirm redundancy by testing whether $LFC_{\\mathrm{WT}} - LFC_{\\Delta degS} - LFC_{\\Delta cpxR} + LFC_{\\Delta degS \\Delta cpxR} \\neq 0$. Control FDR across tests.**\n\nThis option describes the exact experimental and analytical framework derived above. It correctly uses viable mutants that block pathway activation ($\\Delta degS$, $\\Delta cpxR$). It includes the necessary double mutant for interaction analysis. It correctly specifies that comparisons must be made between stressed and unstressed samples *within each genotype* (Constraint 1). It uses a short time point to minimize indirect effects (Constraint 3). The logical and statistical framework for classifying genes, including the use of an interaction term, is sound and rigorous (Constraint 4). It respects the essentiality of `rpoE` (Constraint 2).\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Construct WT, $\\Delta rpoE$, and $\\Delta cpxA$. Expose only the mutants to SDS-EDTA for one hour and compare their stressed transcriptomes to the unstressed WT. Assign genes unchanged in $\\Delta rpoE$ as Cpx-dependent and those unchanged in $\\Delta cpxA$ as $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{E}}$-dependent; classify any gene unchanged in the double deletion background as independent.**\n\nThis option is fundamentally flawed for several reasons. First, it proposes constructing a $\\Delta rpoE$ mutant, which is stated to be essential and thus non-viable under standard conditions, violating Constraint 2. Second, it compares a stressed mutant to an unstressed wild type, which is an invalid comparison. This approach conflates the baseline transcriptional differences caused by the mutation with the transcriptional changes caused by the stress, violating Constraint 1. Third, a one-hour exposure is too long and will capture a multitude of indirect, secondary effects, violating the spirit of Constraint 3. The analytical logic is also poorly defined and non-rigorous.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. In WT only, co-express the outer membrane lipoprotein NlpE to activate Cpx while simultaneously overexpressing the anti-sigma factor RseA to inhibit $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{E}}$, then apply SDS-EDTA. Compare RNA-seq to an unstressed WT without inducers and call genes that decrease upon RseA overexpression $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{E}}$-dependent and genes that increase upon NlpE expression Cpx-dependent.**\n\nThis option is an illogical mess. It attempts to study the response to SDS-EDTA while simultaneously perturbing the system with two artificial inducers/inhibitors (NlpE and RseA). The single comparison of this multi-perturbed state to a simple unstressed control makes it impossible to disentangle the effects of SDS-EDTA from the effects of NlpE and RseA overexpression. This violates the principle of controlling variables and fails Constraint 1. Furthermore, this design does not allow for identifying genes that are jointly regulated or independent of both pathways in the context of the SDS-EDTA stress. It is not an analysis of the natural stress response.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. In WT only, perform an RNA-seq time course after SDS-EDTA and cluster genes by induction kinetics. Classify early-upregulated clusters as $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{E}}$-dependent and late-upregulated clusters as Cpx-dependent, arguing that $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{E}}$ mobilizes more rapidly than a TCS.**\n\nThis approach is correlational, not causal. It relies on a strong, and not necessarily true, assumption about the relative activation kinetics of the two pathways. While kinetic differences may exist, they are not a substitute for genetic evidence of dependency. This method cannot definitively assign a gene to a regulon. A gene could be an indirect, but fast, target of the Cpx pathway, or a direct, but slow, target of the $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{E}}$ pathway. Without genetic knockouts to demonstrate necessity, any classification is speculative. This fails to meet the requirement for a rigorous assignment strategy and does not use the genetic tools (`degS`, `cpxR`) mandated by the constraints.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Construct $\\Delta rseA$ to hyperactivate $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{E}}$ and $\\Delta nlpE$ to block Cpx activation. Expose both and WT to SDS-EDTA and compute $LFC$ versus WT unstressed. Call genes with higher $LFC$ in $\\Delta rseA$ than WT as $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{E}}$-dependent and genes with lower $LFC$ in $\\Delta nlpE$ as Cpx-dependent; no double mutant is needed if effect sizes are large.**\n\nThis option suffers from multiple serious errors. First, like option B, it compares stressed mutants to an unstressed WT control, which is an invalid comparison that violates Constraint 1. Second, the choice of mutants is suboptimal. A $\\Delta rseA$ mutant has a constitutively active $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{E}}$ pathway, which creates a profoundly altered baseline physiology, complicating interpretation of a stress response. A $\\Delta nlpE$ mutant is not a reliable way to block the Cpx pathway, as other stressors (including those generated by SDS-EDTA) can activate Cpx via NlpE-independent mechanisms. A $\\Delta cpxR$ mutant would be the correct choice. Third, the assertion that \"no double mutant is needed\" is a direct violation of Constraint 3 and demonstrates a misunderstanding of how to analyze genetic interactions. Without the double mutant, it is impossible to correctly classify genes that are co-regulated or redundant.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Conclusion**\nOnly Option A provides a scientifically and statistically rigorous design that satisfies all the constraints laid out in the problem statement. It employs the correct genetic tools, proper controls, and a sound analytical framework to successfully achieve the stated goal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2481448"}]}
