A solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) and Steady-State Concentration**\n\nWe apply the principle of mass balance to the total amount of autoinducer in moles, $M(t)$, within the fixed volume $V$. The concentration $c(t)$ is related to $M(t)$ by $M(t) = c(t)V$. The mass balance equation is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of Generation}) - (\\text{Rate of Consumption})\n$$\n\nSince the volume $V$ is constant, the rate of accumulation $\\frac{dM(t)}{dt}$ can be expressed in terms of concentration as $V \\frac{dc(t)}{dt}$.\n\nThe rate of generation is the total production from all $N$ cells. With each cell producing autoinducer at a rate $q$, the total generation rate is $Nq$.\n\nThe rate of consumption is due to first-order decay. According to mass-action kinetics, the rate of a first-order reaction is proportional to the amount of substance present. The rate of decay in moles per second is $k_d M(t) = k_d c(t) V$.\n\nSubstituting these terms into the mass balance equation:\n$$\nV \\frac{dc(t)}{dt} = Nq - k_d V c(t)\n$$\n\nTo obtain the ordinary differential equation for $c(t)$, we divide all terms by the volume $V$:\n$$\n\\frac{dc(t)}{dt} = \\frac{Nq}{V} - k_d c(t)\n$$\nThis is the required differential equation.\n\nThe steady-state concentration, $c^{*}$, is the concentration at which $\\frac{dc(t)}{dt} = 0$. Setting the left side of the ODE to zero:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{Nq}{V} - k_d c^{*}\n$$\nSolving for $c^{*}$:\n$$\nk_d c^{*} = \\frac{Nq}{V}\n$$\n$$\nc^{*} = \\frac{Nq}{Vk_d}\n$$\n\n**2. Formalization of Activation Condition and Minimal Cell Number $N_{\\min}$**\n\nQuorum sensing activation occurs when the steady-state concentration $c^{*}$ meets or exceeds the threshold $K$. This is formalized as the inequality:\n$$\nc^{*} \\ge K\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $c^{*}$:\n$$\n\\frac{Nq}{Vk_d} \\ge K\n$$\nTo find the condition on the cell number $N$, we rearrange the inequality:\n$$\nNq \\ge K V k_d\n$$\n$$\nN \\ge \\frac{K V k_d}{q}\n$$\nThe problem defines $N_{\\min}$ as the smallest integer $N$ that satisfies this condition. This corresponds to the ceiling of the expression on the right-hand side.\n$$\nN_{min} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{K V k_d}{q} \\right\\rceil\n$$\n\n**3.

The rate of change of $A(t)$ in a well-mixed, constant volume system is given by the balance of production and removal rates. The total production rate is the product of the cell density, $n$, and the per-cell secretion rate, $s$. The removal of AIP is described by two parallel first-order processes: a baseline clearance with rate constant $k_0$ and proteolytic inactivation with rate constant $k_p$.
