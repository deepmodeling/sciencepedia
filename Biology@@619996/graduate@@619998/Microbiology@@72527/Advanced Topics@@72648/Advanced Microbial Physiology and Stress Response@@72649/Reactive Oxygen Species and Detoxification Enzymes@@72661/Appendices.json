A solution will be derived.\n\n**Problem Solution**\n\nThe cellular redox potential, $E_{h}$, for a given redox couple is described by the Nernst equation. This equation relates the actual potential of a half-reaction to the standard potential and the concentrations of the oxidized and reduced species. The general form of the Nernst equation is:\n$$E_{h} = E^{\\circ} - \\frac{RT}{nF} \\ln Q$$\nwhere $E^{\\circ}$ is the standard redox potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $n$ is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the half-reaction, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $Q$ is the reaction quotient.\n\nThe half-reaction is given as:\n$$\\mathrm{GSSG} + 2\\mathrm{H}^{+} + 2\\mathrm{e}^{-} \\leftrightarrows 2\\mathrm{GSH}$$\nFor this reaction, the reaction quotient $Q$ would be $Q = \\frac{[\\mathrm{GSH}]^2}{[\\mathrm{GSSG}][\\mathrm{H}^{+}]^2}$. However, the problem provides the standard *transformed* redox potential, $E^{\\circ'}$, at a specified pH of $7.0$. This value, $E^{\\circ'}$, has already incorporated the concentration of hydrogen ions, $[\\mathrm{H}^{+}] = 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{M}$. The Nernst equation can therefore be simplified by using $E^{\\circ'}$ and a modified reaction quotient that omits the $[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]$ term.\n\nThe Nernst equation for a transformed potential is:\n$$E_{h} = E^{\\circ'} - \\frac{RT}{nF} \\ln \\left( \\frac{[\\text{products}]}{[\\text{reactants}]} \\right)$$\nFor the given reduction half-reaction, the product is the reduced form ($2\\mathrm{GSH}$) and the reactant is the oxidized form ($\\mathrm{GSSG}$). The reaction quotient, $Q'$, is thus:\n$$Q' = \\frac{[\\mathrm{GSH}]^2}{[\\mathrm{GSSG}]}$$\nIt is critical to note that the reaction quotient must be dimensionless. This is achieved by dividing each concentration by the standard concentration, $c^{\\circ} = 1\\,\\mathrm{M}$. However, since the units will cancel in the ratio, we can use the given concentrations in millimolar (mM) directly for the ratio calculation, or convert both to Molar (M).

Let $M^*$ denote the steady-state mean mRNA copy number. The balance equation becomes:\n$$\n0 = k_{mean} - \\gamma M^*\n$$\nSolving for $M^*$ yields:\n$$\nM^* = \\frac{k_{mean}}{\\gamma}\n$$\nSubstituting the complete expression for $k_{mean}$ gives the final analytical result for $M^*$:\n$$\nM^* = \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\left( k_0 + (k_1 - k_0) \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{eq}} [H]^{n}}{1 + K_{\\mathrm{eq}} [H]^{n}} \\right)\n$$\nWe now proceed to substitute the given numerical values into this expression.
