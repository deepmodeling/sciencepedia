The roles of $c$-di-GMP, $DGC$ enzymes (with $GGDEF$ domains), and $PDE$ enzymes (with $EAL$ domains) in controlling the motility-sessility switch are fundamental concepts in modern microbiology. The description of the $EAL$ domain's catalytic mechanism, including the critical role of the conserved glutamate residue, is factually correct and consistent with extensive biochemical and structural research.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear and complete set of conditions: a specific biological system, a defined perturbation (the $E \\to A$ mutation), and key constraints (\"dominant $PDE$\", \"DGC input flux remains unchanged\"). It asks for a qualitative prediction of the system's response, for which a unique and logical solution can be derived.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, technical language, free from ambiguity or subjective content.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It contains no invalidating flaws. Therefore, it is deemed **valid**. The solution shall proceed.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe steady-state concentration of an intracellular messenger like $c$-di-GMP, denoted as $[c\\text{-di-GMP}]_{ss}$, is maintained when its rate of synthesis is equal to its rate of degradation. This can be expressed as a flux balance equation:\n$$\nJ_{synthesis} = J_{degradation}\n$$\nIn this system, $J_{synthesis}$ is the flux produced by the $DGC$ enzyme, and $J_{degradation}$ is the flux consumed by the $PDE$ enzyme. The problem states that the $DGC$ input flux is constant, let us call this constant $C$. It also states that the $EAL$-domain $PDE$ is the dominant hydrolase, so we can approximate $J_{degradation} \\approx J_{PDE}$.\n$$\nC = J_{PDE}\n$$\nThe rate of an enzymatic reaction, $J_{PDE}$, is a function of the enzyme's catalytic parameters and the substrate concentration. According to Michaelis-Menten kinetics, this rate is given by:\n$$\nJ_{PDE} = \\frac{V_{max} \\cdot [c\\text{-di-GMP}]}{K_m + [c\\text{-di-GMP}]}\n$$\nwhere $V_{max} = k_{cat} \\cdot [E]_{total}$, with $k_{cat}$ being the catalytic turnover number and $[E]_{total}$ being the total concentration of the $PDE$ enzyme.\n\nThe problem describes a point mutation that changes the catalytic glutamate ($E$) to alanine ($A$) in the $EAL$ motif. The glutamate residue, with its negatively charged carboxylate side chain, is explicitly stated to be essential for catalysis by activating the nucleophilic water molecule and coordinating metal cofactors. Alanine possesses a small, nonpolar methyl side chain, which is incapable of performing these functions. This $E \\to A$ substitution is non-conservative and is a classic example of a mutation that ablates or severely diminishes enzyme function.\n\nConsequently, the catalytic efficiency of the mutated $PDE$ will be drastically reduced. This means its turnover number, $k_{cat}$, will approach zero ($k_{cat} \\rightarrow 0$). As a result, the maximal velocity, $V_{max}$, of the mutated $PDE$ also plummets.\n\nTo maintain the steady-state flux balance, $C = J_{PDE}$, with a constant synthesis rate $C$ and a severely compromised $V_{max}$, the concentration of the substrate, $[c\\text{-di-GMP}]_{ss}$, must increase significantly. If the mutated enzyme were completely inactive ($k_{cat} = 0$), the concentration of $c$-di-GMP would rise until its degradation by other, non-dominant pathways or its cellular export balances the synthesis flux. In any case, the new steady-state level of $c$-di-GMP will be substantially higher than in the wild-type strain.\n\nThe final step is to predict the phenotypic outcome. The role of $c$-di-GMP as a second messenger controlling the switch from a motile (planktonic) lifestyle to a sessile (biofilm) lifestyle is a central paradigm. High intracellular concentrations of $c$-di-GMP act as a signal to:\n$1$. Repress motility, which involves downregulating the synthesis and function of flagella.\n$2$. Promote sessility, which involves upregulating the production of biofilm matrix components, such as adhesins and exopolysaccharides.\n\nTherefore, the elevated level of $[c\\text{-di-GMP}]_{ss}$ resulting from the impaired $PDE$ will cause a decrease in swimming and swarming motility and an increase in biofilm formation.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. The mutation abolishes PDE catalysis, causing a rise in c-di-GMP steady-state; motility decreases and biofilm formation increases.**\nThis statement is entirely consistent with the derivation from first principles. The E$\\to$A mutation in the catalytic site cripples the $PDE$ enzyme. With synthesis unchanged and degradation impaired, the substrate ($c$-di-GMP) accumulates. High levels of $c$-di-GMP are the canonical signal for reduced motility and enhanced biofilm formation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The mutation reduces DGC synthesis of c-di-GMP, causing a drop in c-di-GMP; motility increases and biofilm formation decreases.**\nThis is incorrect. The mutation is in the $PDE$ (degradation enzyme), not the $DGC$ (synthesis enzyme). The problem explicitly states that the \"net $DGC$ input flux remains unchanged.\" This option contradicts the given information.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. There is no substantial change in c-di-GMP or phenotype because alanine conservatively substitutes for glutamate and other PDEs fully compensate.**\nThis is incorrect on two counts. First, the substitution of an acidic, charged residue (glutamate) with a small, nonpolar residue (alanine) is non-conservative, especially at a catalytically essential position. It is expected to severely disrupt function. Second, the problem states this $PDE$ is \"dominant,\" implying that other $PDEs$, if present, have a minor role and cannot fully compensate for the loss of the primary hydrolase. Thus, a substantial change is expected.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The mutation shunts precursors to cyclic di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP), increasing c-di-AMP, which decreases biofilm and increases motility.**\nThis is speculative and unfounded. The mutation affects an enzyme that acts on $c$-di-GMP itself, not its precursor ($GTP$). There is no information or biochemical principle provided to suggest that a defect in $c$-di-GMP degradation would affect the synthesis of a different second messenger, $c$-di-AMP (which is synthesized from $ATP$). This option introduces an irrelevant pathway.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. c-di-GMP rises because PDE is impaired, but motility increases and biofilm decreases because high c-di-GMP inhibits adhesins and exopolysaccharide synthesis.**\nThe first clause, \"$c$-di-GMP rises because $PDE$ is impaired,\" is correct. However, the conclusion about the phenotype is incorrect. It describes a response that is the inverse of the well-established biological role of $c$-di-GMP. High $c$-di-GMP levels almost universally promote biofilm formation (by activating adhesin and exopolysaccharide synthesis) and inhibit motility.

It describes a standard biophysical model of allosteric regulation, specifically an application of the Adair-Klotz formalism for cooperative ligand binding to a dimeric protein. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system consists of a homodimeric protein, $D$, which can bind up to two molecules of a ligand, c-di-GMP, denoted as $G$. We are given three possible states for the dimer: unliganded ($D$), singly liganded ($DG$), and doubly liganded ($DG_2$). The analysis will be based on statistical thermodynamics and the law of mass action.\n\nFirst, we define the statistical weights of each state, which are proportional to their concentrations at equilibrium. Let $[G]$ be the free concentration of the ligand and $K_d$ be the microscopic dissociation constant for a single binding event to an empty site. The dimensionless ligand concentration is given as $c \\equiv [G]/K_d$.\n\n1.  The unliganded state, $D$, is taken as the reference state. Its statistical weight is set to $1$.\n\n2.  The singly liganded state, $DG$, can be formed in two ways, as the ligand can bind to either of the two identical sites on the dimer. The equilibrium for binding to one specific site is described by the microscopic association constant $K_a = 1/K_d$. The concentration of dimers liganded at one specific site is $[D][G]/K_d = [D]c$. Since there are two equivalent sites, the total concentration of the singly liganded species is $[DG] = 2[D]c$. Thus, the statistical weight of the $DG$ state is $2c$.\n\n3.  The doubly liganded state, $DG_2$, is formed when both sites are occupied. For non-cooperative binding, the binding of the second ligand would also be governed by the microscopic constant $K_d$. The overall equilibrium $D + 2G \\rightleftharpoons DG_2$ would have an association constant of $(1/K_d)^2$. The problem states that a cooperativity factor, $\\omega$, stabilizes the doubly liganded state. This factor multiplicatively modifies the overall association constant. Therefore, the equilibrium constant for the formation of the doubly liganded state is $K_{A,overall} = \\frac{[DG_2]}{[D][G]^2} = \\frac{\\omega}{K_d^2}$. The concentration of the $DG_2$ state is $[DG_2] = [D] \\frac{\\omega [G]^2}{K_d^2} = [D]\\omega c^2$. The statistical weight of the $DG_2$ state is $\\omega c^2$.\n\nThe partition function, $Z$, is the sum of the statistical weights of all possible states:\n$$Z = 1 + 2c + \\omega c^2$$\nThe problem asserts that transcriptional activity, $A(c, \\omega)$, is the probability that a dimer is in the doubly liganded state. This is the fraction of the total protein population that is in the $DG_2$ state. The assumption of a vanishingly small promoter concentration ensures that promoter binding does not deplete the pool of $DG_2$, so the ligand-binding equilibrium is not perturbed.\n$$A(c, \\omega) = \\frac{\\text{statistical weight of } DG_2}{Z} = \\frac{\\omega c^2}{1 + 2c + \\omega c^2}$$\nThis completes the first part of the derivation.\n\nNext, we compute the effective Hill coefficient, $n_H$.

We find the corresponding dimensionless concentration, $c_{1/2}$, by solving $A(c_{1/2}, \\omega) = 1/2$:\n$$\\frac{\\omega c_{1/2}^2}{1 + 2c_{1/2} + \\omega c_{1/2}^2} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$2\\omega c_{1/2}^2 = 1 + 2c_{1/2} + \\omega c_{1/2}^2$$\n$$\\omega c_{1/2}^2 - 2c_{1/2} - 1 = 0$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $c_{1/2}$. Applying the quadratic formula and selecting the physically meaningful positive solution (since $c$ must be positive):\n$$c_{1/2} = \\frac{-(-2) + \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4(\\omega)(-1)}}{2\\omega} = \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{4 + 4\\omega}}{2\\omega} = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1+\\omega}}{\\omega}$$\nNow, we evaluate the logit term $\\ln(A/(A_{\\max}-A))$:\n$$\\frac{A}{1 - A} = \\frac{\\frac{\\omega c^2}{1 + 2c + \\omega c^2}}{1 - \\frac{\\omega c^2}{1 + 2c + \\omega c^2}} = \\frac{\\omega c^2}{1 + 2c + \\omega c^2 - \\omega c^2} = \\frac{\\omega c^2}{1 + 2c}$$\nThe argument of the derivative is $\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\omega c^2}{1 + 2c}\\right)$.

Therefore, the derivative can be taken with respect to $\\ln c$:\n$$n_H(c) = \\frac{d}{d\\ln c} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\omega c^2}{1 + 2c}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{d}{d\\ln c} \\left[ \\ln\\omega + 2\\ln c - \\ln(1+2c) \\right]$$\nWe compute the derivative term by term:\n$$\\frac{d(\\ln\\omega)}{d\\ln c} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{d(2\\ln c)}{d\\ln c} = 2$$\n$$\\frac{d(\\ln(1+2c))}{d\\ln c} = c \\frac{d}{dc}\\ln(1+2c) = c \\cdot \\frac{2}{1+2c} = \\frac{2c}{1+2c}$$\nCombining these results, we get the Hill coefficient as a function of $c$:\n$$n_H(c) = 2 - \\frac{2c}{1+2c} = \\frac{2(1+2c) - 2c}{1+2c} = \\frac{2+4c-2c}{1+2c} = \\frac{2+2c}{1+2c} = \\frac{2(1+c)}{1+2c}$$\nFinally, we evaluate this expression at $c = c_{1/2}$:\n$$n_H = n_H(c_{1/2}) = \\frac{2(1+c_{1/2})}{1+2c_{1/2}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $c_{1/2}$:\n$$n_H = \\frac{2\\left(1 + \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1+\\omega}}{\\omega}\\right)}{1 + 2\\left(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1+\\omega}}{\\omega}\\right)} = \\frac{2\\left(\\frac{\\omega + 1 + \\sqrt{1+\\omega}}{\\omega}\\right)}{\\frac{\\omega + 2 + 2\\sqrt{1+\\omega}}{\\omega}} = \\frac{2(\\omega + 1 + \\sqrt{1+\\omega})}{\\omega + 2 + 2\\sqrt{1+\\omega}}$$\nTo simplify this expression, let $x = \\sqrt{1+\\omega}$. It follows that $\\omega = x^2-1$. We substitute this into the numerator and denominator.\nNumerator: $2(\\omega + 1 + \\sqrt{1+\\omega}) = 2((x^2-1) + 1 + x) = 2(x^2+x) = 2x(x+1)$.\nDenominator: $\\omega + 2 + 2\\sqrt{1+\\omega} = (x^2-1) + 2 + 2x = x^2+2x+1 = (x+1)^2$.\nThus, the expression for $n_H$ simplifies to:\n$$n_H = \\frac{2x(x+1)}{(x+1)^2} = \\frac{2x}{x+1}$$\nSubstituting back $x = \\sqrt{1+\\omega}$, we obtain the final closed-form expression for the Hill coefficient as a function of the cooperativity parameter $\\omega$:\n$$n_H = \\frac{2\\sqrt{1+\\omega}}{1+\\sqrt{1+\\omega}}$$\nThis expression correctly predicts $n_H \\to 2$ for strong positive cooperativity ($\\omega \\to \\infty$), $n_H = 4-2\\sqrt{2}$ for no cooperativity ($\\omega=1$), and $n_H \\to 1$ for strong negative cooperativity ($\\omega \\to 0$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{1+\\omega}}{1+\\sqrt{1+\\omega}}}$$", "id": "2531622"}]}
