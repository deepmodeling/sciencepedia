There is no biomass in the feed, so $X_{\\mathrm{in}} = 0$. The net volumetric rate of biomass generation, $r_X$, is given by the net specific growth rate multiplied by the biomass concentration.

The influent substrate concentration is $S_{\\mathrm{in}}$. The volumetric rate of substrate consumption, $-r_S$, is linked to the gross rate of biomass formation by the true yield coefficient $Y_{X/S}$. Endogenous decay is an internal process of biomass loss and is assumed here not to consume the external substrate. Thus, substrate is consumed only for growth.\n$$\n-r_S = \\frac{\\text{gross rate of biomass generation}}{Y_{X/S}} = \\frac{\\mu(S)X}{Y_{X/S}}\n$$\nSo, the generation term is $r_S = -\\frac{\\mu(S)X}{Y_{X/S}}$.

Thus, the washout steady state is characterized by $(\\bar{X}, \\bar{S}) = (0, S_{\\mathrm{in}})$.\n\n2.  **Non-Washout State (Coexistence):** This solution corresponds to $\\bar{X} > 0$.

This boundary condition corresponds to the limit where $\\bar{X} \\to 0$, which implies that $\\bar{S} \\to S_{\\mathrm{in}}$.\nWe can find this critical dilution rate by substituting $\\bar{S} = S_{\\mathrm{in}}$ into the steady-state relation $\\mu(\\bar{S}) = D + k_d$. Let's call this specific dilution rate $D_{\\mathrm{wash}}$:\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{wash}} + k_d = \\mu(S_{\\mathrm{in}})\n$$\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{wash}} = \\mu(S_{\\mathrm{in}}) - k_d\n$$\nSubstituting the Monod expression for $\\mu(S_{\\mathrm{in}})$:\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{wash}} = \\mu_{\\max} \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{in}}}{K_{S} + S_{\\mathrm{in}}} - k_{d}\n$$\nFor any dilution rate $D > D_{\\mathrm{wash}}$, the required growth rate to maintain a steady state, $\\mu(\\bar{S}) = D + k_d$, is greater than the maximum possible growth rate with the given feed, $\\mu(S_{\\mathrm{in}})$. Consequently, the organism cannot grow fast enough, and the biomass concentration will decline to zero, leading to washout.\n\n**Numerical Calculation:**\nWe are given the following parameter values:\n$\\mu_{\\max} = 0.85 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n$K_{S} = 0.008 \\ \\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n$S_{\\mathrm{in}} = 0.030 \\ \\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n$k_{d} = 0.06 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived expression for $D_{\\mathrm{wash}}$:\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{wash}} = 0.85 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1} \\times \\frac{0.030 \\ \\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}}{0.008 \\ \\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1} + 0.030 \\ \\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}} - 0.06 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{wash}} = 0.85 \\times \\frac{0.030}{0.038} - 0.06 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{wash}} = 0.85 \\times 0.78947368... - 0.06 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{wash}} = 0.67105263... - 0.06 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{wash}} = 0.61105263... \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{wash}} \\approx 0.6111 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}\n$$\nThis is the final numerical answer.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.6111}\n$$", "id": "2488592"}]}
