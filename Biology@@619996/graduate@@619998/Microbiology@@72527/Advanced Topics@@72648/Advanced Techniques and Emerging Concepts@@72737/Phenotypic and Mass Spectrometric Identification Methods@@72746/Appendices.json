It is grounded in the established microbiological identification techniques of phenotypic profiling and mass spectrometry. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and definitions for a unique, computable solution. The supplied definitions for similarity are standard: the set-theoretic definition for binary data corresponds to the Jaccard index, and the angle-based definition for spectral vectors corresponds to cosine similarity. We will proceed with a systematic calculation.\n\nThe task is to compute a combined similarity score for three candidate species (A, B, C) against an unknown isolate and identify the maximum score. The combined score is a weighted average of a phenotypic similarity score and a mass spectrometric similarity score.\n\nFirst, we analyze the phenotypic data. The isolate's assimilation pattern for the $18$ substrates is given as $(+,-,+,+,-,+,+,-,+,-,-,+,+,-,-,+,-,+)$. We represent this as a set of indices for the positive results, which we denote as $I$.\n$$ I = \\{1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 16, 18\\} $$\nThe number of positive results for the isolate is $|I| = 10$.\n\nThe reference species' positive results are also given as sets:\n- Species A: $R_A = \\{1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16\\}$, with $|R_A| = 10$.\n- Species B: $R_B = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 18\\}$, with $|R_B| = 10$.\n- Species C: $R_C = \\{2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17\\}$, with $|R_C| = 10$.\n\nThe phenotypic similarity, $S_{pheno}$, is defined as the ratio of the number of shared positive results to the total number of unique positive results. This is the Jaccard index, calculated as $S_{pheno}(I, R) = \\frac{|I \\cap R|}{|I \\cup R|} = \\frac{|I \\cap R|}{|I| + |R| - |I \\cap R|}$.\n\nFor Species A:\n$I \\cap R_A = \\{1, 4, 6, 7, 12, 13, 16\\}$.\n$|I \\cap R_A| = 7$.\n$S_{pheno, A} = \\frac{7}{10 + 10 - 7} = \\frac{7}{13}$.\n\nFor Species B:\n$I \\cap R_B = \\{1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 12, 18\\}$.\n$|I \\cap R_B| = 7$.\n$S_{pheno, B} = \\frac{7}{10 + 10 - 7} = \\frac{7}{13}$.\n\nFor Species C:\n$I \\cap R_C = \\{3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 13, 16\\}$.\n$|I \\cap R_C| = 7$.\n$S_{pheno, C} = \\frac{7}{10 + 10 - 7} = \\frac{7}{13}$.\n\nThe phenotypic similarity is identical for all three candidate species.
