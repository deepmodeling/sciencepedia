The problem does not violate any criteria for validity.\n\nVerdict: The problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**1) Determination of the Critical Angle $\\theta_c$**\n\nThe critical angle, $\\theta_c$, is defined as the angle of incidence in the denser medium (medium $1$) for which the angle of refraction in the less dense medium (medium $2$) is exactly $90^{\\circ}$. Beyond this angle, the wave is totally internally reflected.\n\nWe begin with Snell's law at the interface between medium $1$ and medium $2$:\n$$n_1 \\sin\\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin\\theta_2$$\nwhere $\\theta_1$ is the angle of incidence and $\\theta_2$ is the angle of refraction.\nBy definition of the critical angle, we set $\\theta_1 = \\theta_c$ and $\\theta_2 = 90^{\\circ}$:\n$$n_1 \\sin\\theta_c = n_2 \\sin(90^{\\circ})$$\nSince $\\sin(90^{\\circ}) = 1$, the equation simplifies to:\n$$n_1 \\sin\\theta_c = n_2$$\nSolving for $\\theta_c$ yields:\n$$\\theta_c = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values, $n_1 = 1.518$ and $n_2 = 1.37$:\n$$\\theta_c = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1.37}{1.518}\\right) \\approx \\arcsin(0.902503...)$$\n$$\\theta_c \\approx 64.493...^{\\circ}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the critical angle is $\\theta_c = 64.49^{\\circ}$.\nThe given incidence angle is $\\theta = 70^{\\circ}$. Since $\\theta > \\theta_c$, the condition for total internal reflection is met, and an evanescent field is generated in medium $2$.\n\n**2) Derivation of the Evanescent-Field Penetration Depth $d$**\n\nLet the interface be the $xy$-plane at $z=0$, with medium $1$ at $z<0$ and medium $2$ at $z>0$. The wavevector of the incident plane wave in medium $1$ is $\\mathbf{k}_1$, and the wavevector of the wave in medium $2$ is $\\mathbf{k}_2$. The angle of incidence $\\theta$ is measured with respect to the normal (the $z$-axis).\n\nThe conservation of the tangential component of the wavevector across the interface implies that the component of $\\mathbf{k}$ parallel to the interface is continuous. Let us consider the $x$-component:\n$$k_{1x} = k_{2x}$$\nThe magnitude of the wavevector in medium $1$ is $k_1 = n_1 k_0 = n_1 \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}$. The tangential component is thus:\n$$k_{1x} = k_1 \\sin\\theta = n_1 \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} \\sin\\theta$$\nTherefore, the tangential component of the wavevector in medium $2$ is also:\n$$k_{2x} = n_1 \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} \\sin\\theta$$\nThe dispersion relation in medium $2$, which is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic, relates the components of $\\mathbf{k}_2$ to its magnitude $k_2 = n_2 k_0$:\n$$k_{2x}^2 + k_{2z}^2 = k_2^2 = \\left(n_2 \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\right)^2$$\nWe can now solve for the normal component of the wavevector in medium $2$, $k_{2z}$:\n$$k_{2z}^2 = \\left(n_2 \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\right)^2 - k_{2x}^2 = \\left(n_2 \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\right)^2 - \\left(n_1 \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} \\sin\\theta\\right)^2$$\n$$k_{2z}^2 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\right)^2 (n_2^2 - n_1^2 \\sin^2\\theta)$$\nSince we are in the regime of total internal reflection ($\\theta > \\theta_c$), we have $\\sin\\theta > \\sin\\theta_c = n_2/n_1$, which implies $n_1 \\sin\\theta > n_2$. Consequently, the term $(n_2^2 - n_1^2 \\sin^2\\theta)$ is negative. This means $k_{2z}$ must be a purely imaginary number.\nLet's write $k_{2z}^2 = -1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\right)^2 (n_1^2 \\sin^2\\theta - n_2^2)$.\nThus, $k_{2z}$ takes the form $k_{2z} = i\\kappa$, where $\\kappa$ is a real, positive decay constant:\n$$\\kappa = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} \\sqrt{n_1^2 \\sin^2\\theta - n_2^2}$$\nWe choose the positive imaginary root so the field decays for $z>0$ and does not unphysically grow to infinity. The electric field of the wave in medium $2$ has a spatial dependence of the form $\\exp(i(k_{2x}x + k_{2z}z))$. Substituting $k_{2z} = i\\kappa$:\n$$E(x, z, t) \\propto \\exp(i(k_{2x}x + i\\kappa z)) = \\exp(ik_{2x}x) \\exp(-\\kappa z)$$\nThis describes a wave that propagates along the $x$-direction but decays exponentially along the $z$-direction into medium $2$. This is the evanescent field.\n\nThe intensity $I$ of the field is proportional to the square of the electric field amplitude, $|E|^2$:\n$$I(z) \\propto |\\exp(-\\kappa z)|^2 = \\exp(-2\\kappa z)$$\nThe problem defines the penetration depth $d$ as the distance over which the intensity drops to $1/e$ of its value at the interface, according to the relation $I(z) \\propto \\exp(-z/d)$.\nComparing the two expressions for intensity, we can equate the arguments of the exponential functions:\n$$\\frac{z}{d} = 2\\kappa z \\implies \\frac{1}{d} = 2\\kappa$$\nSolving for $d$ gives:\n$$d = \\frac{1}{2\\kappa} = \\frac{1}{2 \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} \\sqrt{n_1^2 \\sin^2\\theta - n_2^2}}$$\nThe final expression for the penetration depth is:\n$$d = \\frac{\\lambda}{4\\pi \\sqrt{n_1^2 \\sin^2\\theta - n_2^2}}$$\nNow, we evaluate $d$ using the given parameters: $\\lambda = 488\\,\\text{nm}$, $n_1 = 1.518$, $n_2 = 1.37$, and $\\theta = 70^{\\circ}$.\nFirst, we compute the term inside the square root:\n$$\\sin(70^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.9396926$$\n$$n_1^2 \\sin^2\\theta - n_2^2 = (1.518)^2 (\\sin(70^{\\circ}))^2 - (1.37)^2$$\n$$n_1^2 \\sin^2\\theta - n_2^2 \\approx (2.304324)(0.883022) - 1.8769$$\n$$n_1^2 \\sin^2\\theta - n_2^2 \\approx 2.03478 - 1.8769 = 0.15788$$\nNow, substitute this into the expression for $d$:\n$$d = \\frac{488\\,\\text{nm}}{4\\pi \\sqrt{0.15788}} \\approx \\frac{488\\,\\text{nm}}{4\\pi (0.397342)} \\approx \\frac{488\\,\\text{nm}}{4.99283}$$\n$$d \\approx 97.7402...\\,\\text{nm}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the penetration depth is $d = 97.74\\,\\text{nm}$.\n\nThe final requested answer is the two-entry row vector $[\\theta_c, d]$.\n$\\theta_c = 64.49^{\\circ}$\n$d = 97.74\\,\\text{nm}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 64.49 & 97.74 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2468626"}, {"introduction": "In single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), we can pinpoint individual molecules with nanometer precision, but this precision does not always equate to accuracy.

Each is present with equal probability, $p_i = 1/3$. The mixture-averaged second moment, which we denote $\\langle \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[r_{\\mathrm{obs}}^{2}\\right] \\rangle$, is the weighted average of the second moments for each label type.\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[r_{\\mathrm{obs}}^{2}\\right] \\rangle = \\sum_{i} p_i \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[r_{\\mathrm{obs}}^{2} | L=L_i\\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[r_{\\mathrm{obs}}^{2}\\right] \\rangle = \\frac{1}{3}\\left( \\left(R^2 + \\frac{2}{3}L_{\\mathrm{GFP}}^2\\right) + \\left(R^2 + \\frac{2}{3}L_{\\mathrm{Halo}}^2\\right) + \\left(R^2 + \\frac{2}{3}L_{\\mathrm{Ab}}^2\\right) \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying this expression algebraically:\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[r_{\\mathrm{obs}}^{2}\\right] \\rangle = \\frac{1}{3}\\left( 3R^2 + \\frac{2}{3}(L_{\\mathrm{GFP}}^2 + L_{\\mathrm{Halo}}^2 + L_{\\mathrm{Ab}}^2) \\right) = R^2 + \\frac{2}{9}(L_{\\mathrm{GFP}}^2 + L_{\\mathrm{Halo}}^2 + L_{\\mathrm{Ab}}^2)\n$$\nWe are given the values: $R = 12.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $L_{\\mathrm{GFP}} = 3\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $L_{\\mathrm{Halo}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, and $L_{\\mathrm{Ab}} = 15\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. Substituting these into our expression:\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[r_{\\mathrm{obs}}^{2}\\right] \\rangle = (12.5)^2 + \\frac{2}{9}(3^2 + 5^2 + 15^2)\n$$\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[r_{\\mathrm{obs}}^{2}\\right] \\rangle = 156.25 + \\frac{2}{9}(9 + 25 + 225)\n$$\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[r_{\\mathrm{obs}}^{2}\\right] \\rangle = 156.25 + \\frac{2}{9}(259) = 156.25 + \\frac{518}{9}\n$$\nTo perform the final addition, we convert to a common denominator:\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[r_{\\mathrm{obs}}^{2}\\right] \\rangle = \\frac{1406.25}{9} + \\frac{518}{9} = \\frac{1924.25}{9} \\approx 213.8055\\ldots \\ \\mathrm{nm}^2\n$$\nThe RMS apparent diameter is defined as $D_{\\mathrm{RMS}} = 2\\sqrt{\\langle \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[r_{\\mathrm{obs}}^{2}\\right] \\rangle}$.\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{RMS}} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{1924.25}{9}} = 2 \\frac{\\sqrt{1924.25}}{3}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{RMS}} \\approx 2 \\times \\frac{43.86627}{3} \\approx 2 \\times 14.62209 \\approx 29.24418\\ \\mathrm{nm}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required by the problem statement, we obtain $29.24$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{29.24}$$", "id": "2468579"}]}
