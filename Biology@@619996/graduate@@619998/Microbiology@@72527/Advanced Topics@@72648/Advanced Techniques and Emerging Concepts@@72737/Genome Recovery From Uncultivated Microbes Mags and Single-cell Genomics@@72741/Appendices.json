A complete, reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the expected fraction of uncovered bases from first principles and then a calculation of this fraction and the average coverage.\n\nFirst, we address the definition and calculation of the average coverage, denoted by $C$. The problem statement defines sequencing depth (coverage) as the total number of sequenced bases divided by the genome size.\n\nThe total number of bases sequenced is the product of the number of reads, $N$, and the length of each read, $L$.\n$$\n\\text{Total bases sequenced} = N \\times L\n$$\n\nThe genome size is given as $G$. Thus, the average coverage $C$ is:\n$$\nC = \\frac{N \\times L}{G}\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the expected fraction of the genome that remains uncovered. The derivation must start from the premise of \"many independent, rare trials,\" which is the classical foundation for the Poisson distribution.\n\nConsider a single, arbitrary base in the genome. We wish to find the probability that this base is not covered by any of the $N$ sequenced reads.\n\nA single read of length $L$ covers a specific base if the read's starting position falls within a genomic window of length $L$ that ends at the base in question. Given a circular genome of size $G$ and the assumption of uniform random read start positions, the probability $p$ that a single, randomly chosen read covers this specific base is the ratio of the length of this target window to the total genome size:\n$$\np = \\frac{L}{G}\n$$\n\nSince the reads are independent, the event of being covered by one read is independent of being covered by another. The probability that a single read does *not* cover the specific base is therefore $1-p$.\n$$\n1-p = 1 - \\frac{L}{G}\n$$\n\nThere are $N$ independent reads in total. The probability that *none* of these $N$ reads cover the specific base is the product of the individual probabilities for each read:\n$$\nP(\\text{base is uncovered}) = (1 - p)^N = \\left(1 - \\frac{L}{G}\\right)^N\n$$\n\nThis expression gives the exact probability under a binomial framework, where each of the $N$ reads is a Bernoulli trial. The problem, however, directs us to use the \"many independent, rare trials\" assumption, which leads to the Poisson approximation. In our context, the number of trials $N$ is very large ($5 \\times 10^7$), and the probability of success $p$ is very small ($p = 150 / (5 \\times 10^6) = 3 \\times 10^{-5}$), which are the precise conditions under which the binomial distribution converges to a Poisson distribution.\n\nLet the random variable $K$ be the number of times a base is covered. $K$ follows a binomial distribution $B(N, p)$. The expected value of $K$, denoted $\\lambda$, is:\n$$\n\\lambda = N \\times p = N \\frac{L}{G}\n$$\nThis parameter $\\lambda$ is identical to our previously defined average coverage $C$.\n$$\n\\lambda = C\n$$\n\nThe probability mass function for a binomial distribution $B(N, p)$ can be approximated by a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda = Np$ when $N$ is large and $p$ is small. The probability of observing $k$ events in a Poisson distribution is:\n$$\nP(K=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}\n$$\n\nWe are interested in the case where a base is uncovered, which corresponds to $k=0$.\n$$\nP(K=0) = \\frac{\\lambda^0 \\exp(-\\lambda)}{0!} = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\exp(-\\lambda)}{1} = \\exp(-\\lambda)\n$$\nSubstituting $\\lambda = C$, the probability that a base is uncovered is $\\exp(-C)$. This can also be shown formally by taking the limit of the binomial probability as $N \\to \\infty$:\n$$\n\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{L}{G}\\right)^N = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{C}{N}\\right)^N = \\exp(-C)\n$$\nDue to the assumption of uniform read distribution, the probability of any single base being uncovered is the same for all bases. Therefore, the expected fraction of the entire genome that is uncovered is also $\\exp(-C)$.\n\nNow, we perform the calculations using the provided values.\n\n1.  **Calculate Average Coverage ($C$)**\n    Given: $G=5\\times 10^{6}$, $N=5\\times 10^{7}$, $L=150$.\n    $$\n    C = \\frac{N \\times L}{G} = \\frac{(5 \\times 10^7) \\times 150}{5 \\times 10^6}\n    $$\n    $$\n    C = \\left(\\frac{5 \\times 10^7}{5 \\times 10^6}\\right) \\times 150 = 10 \\times 150 = 1500\n    $$\n    The average coverage is $1500$. This is a dimensionless quantity, often written as $1500$X.\n\n2.  **Calculate Expected Uncovered Fraction**\n    The expected fraction of the genome that is uncovered is given by $\\exp(-C)$.\n    $$\n    \\text{Uncovered Fraction} = \\exp(-1500)\n    $$\n    This value is an exact expression. It is an exceedingly small positive number, representing a scenario where the genome is sequenced to such a depth that the probability of any base being missed is almost zero. Expressing it in decimal form is impractical and unnecessary.\n\nThe two requested quantities are the average coverage $C$ and the expected uncovered fraction $\\exp(-C)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1500 & \\exp(-1500) \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2495881"}, {"introduction": "Once a Metagenome-Assembled Genome (MAG) or Single-Cell Amplified Genome (SAG) is constructed, its quality must be rigorously assessed.

Suppose the expected number of single-copy marker genes for this lineage is $m = 120$.

We shall proceed with the derivation and analysis as requested.\n\nThe task is to derive estimators for completeness ($\\hat{c}$) and contamination ($\\hat{t}$) based on a provided set of definitions and parameters, evaluate them numerically, and discuss the statistical confidence in these estimates. The given parameters are: the expected number of single-copy marker genes, $m = 120$; the number of unique markers detected, $u = 92$; and the number of markers found with exactly one additional copy, $d = 6$.\n\nFirst, we derive the estimator for completeness, $\\hat{c}$. The definition provided is \"completeness is the fraction of expected single-copy markers present\". The total number of expected single-copy markers is $m$. The number of these markers that are present (i.e., detected) in the Metagenome-Assembled Genome (MAG) is given as $u$. Therefore, the estimator $\\hat{c}$ is the ratio of the number of unique markers found to the total number of markers in the lineage-specific set.\n$$\n\\hat{c} = \\frac{u}{m}\n$$\nThis estimator represents the proportion of the reference marker gene set that was successfully recovered in the MAG.\n\nSecond, we derive the estimator for contamination, $\\hat{t}$. The definition is \"contamination is the fraction of extra copies of single-copy markers relative to the expected number\". The problem states that there are $d$ duplicated markers, each with \"exactly one additional copy\". Thus, the total number of \"extra copies\" is equal to $d$. The definition specifies that this fraction is \"relative to the expected number\". The only relevant \"expected number\" defined in the problem is $m$, the size of the marker gene set. Consequently, the estimator $\\hat{t}$ is the ratio of the number of extra copies to the total number of expected marker genes.\n$$\n\\hat{t} = \\frac{d}{m}\n$$\nThis formulation measures the level of duplication-based contamination normalized by the size of the genome proxy, which is the marker set.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into these estimators. The parameters are $m = 120$, $u = 92$, and $d = 6$.\nFor completeness, $\\hat{c}$:\n$$\n\\hat{c} = \\frac{92}{120} = \\frac{23}{30} = 0.7666\\overline{6}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the value is $\\hat{c} \\approx 0.7667$.\n\nFor contamination, $\\hat{t}$:\n$$\n\\hat{t} = \\frac{6}{120} = \\frac{1}{20} = 0.05\n$$\nExpressed with four significant figures, this value is $0.05000$.\n\nFinally, we discuss the confidence in these estimates from first principles. The values $\\hat{c}$ and $\\hat{t}$ are point estimates derived from a sample and are subject to statistical error.\n\nThe confidence in the completeness estimate $\\hat{c}$ is determined by the size of the marker set, $m$. We can model the observation of each marker gene as an independent Bernoulli trial, where the probability of success (detection) is the true completeness, $p_c$. The number of detected markers, $u$, thus follows a binomial distribution, $u \\sim \\text{Binomial}(m, p_c)$. The estimator $\\hat{c} = u/m$ is the standard sample proportion. The uncertainty of this estimate, quantified by its standard error, is $\\text{SE}(\\hat{c}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{p_c(1-p_c)}{m}}$, which is estimated as $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{c}(1-\\hat{c})}{m}}$. The standard error is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size, $\\sqrt{m}$. For $m=120$, the marker set size is finite and introduces a tangible, though not excessive, degree of uncertainty. A larger $m$ would yield a smaller standard error and thus a narrower confidence interval, signifying higher confidence.\n\nThe confidence in the contamination estimate $\\hat{t}$ is severely impacted by the low count of observed duplication events, $d=6$. The occurrence of duplications can be modeled as a rare event, and thus the count $d$ can be treated as an observation from a Poisson distribution with an unknown true mean rate $\\lambda$. The contamination estimate is $\\hat{t} = d/m$. The primary source of uncertainty in $\\hat{t}$ is the stochasticity of the count $d$. For small integer counts, the Poisson distribution is highly skewed, and the confidence interval for its mean is wide relative to the observed value. For an observation of $d=6$, the $95\\%$ confidence interval for the true mean number of duplicates is approximately $[2.2, 13.1]$. This large uncertainty in the underlying count of extra copies propagates directly to the contamination estimate $\\hat{t}$, resulting in a very wide confidence interval. Consequently, an estimate of contamination based on a small number of duplication events is considered to have low statistical confidence.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.7667 & 0.05000 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2495840"}, {"introduction": "While marker gene analysis is powerful, its core assumptionâ€”that all markers are single-copyâ€”is not always true for every organism.

Such frameworks infer contamination by quantifying extra copies of genes expected to be present once per genome and normalizing by the size of the marker set. A well-tested observation from shotgun sequencing is that, under uniform sampling and absent locus-specific biases, read depth (coverage) is proportional to underlying DNA copy number.

The total number of observed duplicates, which we denote as $D_{obs}$, is the difference between the total instances found and the number of unique genes.\n$$D_{obs} = T - U = 60 - 50 = 10$$\nThis observed count includes duplicates from true contamination and apparent duplicates from multi-copy genes native to the organism. The task is to correct for the latter.\n\nThe adjustment procedure begins with estimating the copy number of the rRNA operon, $\\hat{c}$. The basis for this estimation is the principle that sequencing coverage is proportional to the copy number of the underlying DNA sequence. We must first determine a representative coverage for the rRNA genes. The problem specifies using the median of the three measured rRNA gene coverages. Let this be $m_{rRNA, med}$.\n$$m_{rRNA, med} = \\operatorname{median}(\\{59, 62, 66\\}) = 62$$\nThe copy number $\\hat{c}$ is then estimated by finding the nearest integer to the ratio of this median rRNA coverage to the baseline single-copy coverage, $m_c$.\n$$\\hat{c} = \\operatorname{round}\\left(\\frac{m_{rRNA, med}}{m_c}\\right) = \\operatorname{round}\\left(\\frac{62}{21}\\right) \\approx \\operatorname{round}(2.95238) = 3$$\nThis result indicates that the rRNA genes in this organism are present in approximately $3$ copies.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of duplicate gene counts that are expected from these multi-copy rRNA genes.
