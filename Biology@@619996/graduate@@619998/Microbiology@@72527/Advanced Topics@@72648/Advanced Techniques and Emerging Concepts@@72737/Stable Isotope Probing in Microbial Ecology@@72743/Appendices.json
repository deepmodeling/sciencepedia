It is found to be scientifically grounded, as it deals with fundamental concepts of isotopes, atom counting, and atom fractions, which are cornerstones of chemistry and isotope ecology. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and data for a unique solution. The language is objective and free of ambiguity. For example, the statement \"by atoms\" clearly specifies the basis of the percentage, distinguishing it from a mass-based percentage. The scenario is realistic; carbon-$13$ is a stable heavy isotope of carbon, and its natural abundance is approximately $1.1\\%$. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles, nor does it contain contradictory or incomplete information. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be constructed.\n\nThe task is twofold: first, to derive a general expression for the atom fraction of the heavy isotope, and second, to compute this value for carbon-$13$ based on the provided data.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the general expression.\nThe atom fraction of a specific component in a mixture is defined as the ratio of the number of atoms of that component to the total number of atoms in the mixture. Let $F_{H}$ denote the atom fraction of the heavy isotope. Based on this core definition, we write:\n$$F_{H} = \\frac{\\text{Number of atoms of heavy isotope}}{\\text{Total number of atoms of the element}}$$\nUsing the symbols provided in the problem statement, the number of atoms of the heavy isotope is $n_{H}$, and the total number of atoms of the element is $N$. Thus, the expression becomes:\n$$F_{H} = \\frac{n_{H}}{N}$$\nThe problem states that the total number of atoms, $N$, is the sum of the isotope-specific counts. This is an explicit statement of the principle of atom conservation for the system. Therefore, we have the relation:\n$$N = n_{H} + n_{L}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $N$ into our equation for $F_{H}$, we arrive at the general expression for the atom fraction of the heavy isotope in terms of the counts of the heavy and light isotopes:\n$$F_{H} = \\frac{n_{H}}{n_{H} + n_{L}}$$\nThis derivation starts from the first principle of defining a fraction and incorporates the conservation of atoms, as required.\n\nPart 2: Calculation for carbon-$13$.\nThe problem provides a measured composition of $1.1\\%$ carbon-$13$ by atoms. Carbon-$13$ (${}^{13}\\text{C}$) is the heavy stable isotope of carbon, with carbon-$12$ (${}^{12}\\text{C}$) being the light stable isotope. The given value, $1.1\\%$, is the atom fraction expressed in units of percent (i.e., atom percent). The 'by atoms' specification confirms that this is not a mass percent.\nTo convert a percentage to a dimensionless fraction, one must divide by $100$.\nLet $F_{^{13}\\text{C}}$ be the atom fraction of carbon-$13$.\n$$F_{^{13}\\text{C}} = 1.1\\% = \\frac{1.1}{100}$$\nThe calculation is straightforward:\n$$F_{^{13}\\text{C}} = 0.011$$\nThe problem requires this result to be expressed as a pure decimal number rounded to $4$ significant figures.\nThe number $0.011$ has two significant figures (the two digits '1'). The leading zero is not significant as it only serves to place the decimal point. To express this value with $4$ significant figures, we must append two trailing zeros. These trailing zeros are significant as they indicate the precision of the value.\nTherefore, the atom fraction of carbon-$13$ rounded to $4$ significant figures is $0.01100$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.01100}\n$$", "id": "2534056"}, {"introduction": "The power of DNA-SIP lies in its ability to physically separate DNA molecules based on their isotopic content.
