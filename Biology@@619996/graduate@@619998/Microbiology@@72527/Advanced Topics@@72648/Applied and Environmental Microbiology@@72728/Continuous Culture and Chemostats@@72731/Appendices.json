It is a standard problem in microbial process engineering. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe fundamental principle for analyzing a chemostat is the mass balance equation for a given component $i$:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Accumulation} = \\text{Rate of Input} - \\text{Rate of Output} + \\text{Rate of Net Generation}\n$$\nIn a continuous, well-mixed reactor of constant volume $V$, with a flow rate $F$, this can be written for a generic concentration $C_i$ as:\n$$\nV \\frac{dC_i}{dt} = F C_{i, \\mathrm{in}} - F C_i + r_i V\n$$\nHere, $C_{i, \\mathrm{in}}$ is the concentration of component $i$ in the inflow, and $r_i$ is the net volumetric rate of formation of component $i$ within the reactor. Dividing by the volume $V$ and defining the dilution rate $D = F/V$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_i}{dt} = D(C_{i, \\mathrm{in}} - C_i) + r_i\n$$\nThe system is at steady state, which means the rate of accumulation is zero, $\\frac{dC_i}{dt} = 0$. The concentrations are constant at their steady-state values, which are denoted with a superscript asterisk (*).\n\nLet us apply this general balance to biomass ($X$), substrate ($S$), and product ($P$).\n\n1.  **Biomass Balance**\n    For biomass, the concentration is $X$. The inflow is sterile, so $X_{\\mathrm{in}} = 0$. The net rate of generation is the rate of cell growth, $r_x = \\mu X$, where $\\mu$ is the specific growth rate. We assume negligible cell death or lysis. The balance equation is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dX}{dt} = D(0 - X) + \\mu X = (\\mu - D)X\n    $$\n    At steady state, $\\frac{dX}{dt} = 0$. Since a culture exists ($X^*  0$), this implies that the specific growth rate must equal the dilution rate:\n    $$\n    \\mu = D\n    $$\n    The volumetric rate of biomass formation at steady state is $r_x^* = \\mu X^* = D X^*$.\n\n2.  **Substrate Balance**\n    For substrate, the concentration is $S$, and the inflow concentration is $S_{\\mathrm{in}}$. The substrate is consumed for growth and product formation. The net rate of generation is negative, representing consumption: $r_s = -q_s X$, where $q_s$ is the specific rate of substrate consumption. The balance equation is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dS}{dt} = D(S_{\\mathrm{in}} - S) - q_s X\n    $$\n    At steady state, $\\frac{dS}{dt} = 0$, $S = S^*$, and $X = X^*$. Therefore:\n    $$\n    D(S_{\\mathrm{in}} - S^*) - q_s X^* = 0\n    $$\n    The volumetric rate of substrate consumption is defined as $r_{s,\\text{cons}} = q_s X^*$. From the balance, we find:\n    $$\n    r_{s,\\text{cons}} = D(S_{\\mathrm{in}} - S^*)\n    $$\n\n3.  **Product Balance**\n    For the extracellular product, the concentration is $P$. The inflow contains no product, so $P_{\\mathrm{in}} = 0$. The net rate of generation is the rate of product formation, $r_p = q_p X$, where $q_p$ is the specific rate of product formation. We assume the product is not consumed. The balance equation is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dP}{dt} = D(0 - P) + q_p X = q_p X - DP\n    $$\n    At steady state, $\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0$, $P = P^*$, and $X = X^*$. Therefore:\n    $$\n    q_p X^* - D P^* = 0\n    $$\n    The volumetric rate of product formation at steady state is $r_p^* = q_p X^*$. From the balance, this is:\n    $$\n    r_p^* = D P^*\n    $$\n\nNow, we derive the expressions for the yields based on the provided definition: \"rate of formation of numerator per rate of consumption or formation of denominator\".

Subsequently, an expression for the required fraction will be derived, and finally, this expression will be evaluated under the specified steady-state condition.\n\nThe problem asks for \"the fraction of cells that are removed from the vessel by washout\". The term \"fraction\" constrains the value to the interval $[0, 1]$. This indicates that the question concerns the fate of a specific, defined population of cells. The most natural interpretation is to consider the population of cells present in the vessel at the beginning of the time interval, time $t=0$. Let us denote the concentration of this specific cohort of cells as $X_c(t)$. The initial concentration is $X_c(0)$. These cells are subject to removal from the vessel by washout, but any new cells generated through biological growth are, by definition, not part of this original cohort. Therefore, the mass balance for this specific cohort does not include a growth term.\n\nThe principle of mass conservation for the cohort concentration $X_c$ in a constant volume $V$ with an outflow rate $F$ is:\nRate of Accumulation = Rate of Inflow - Rate of Outflow\nThe volume $V$ is constant, and the inflow contains no cells, so the rate of change of the mass of the cohort, $d(VX_c)/dt$, is determined solely by the outflow.\n$$V \\frac{dX_c}{dt} = 0 - F X_c$$\nDividing by the volume $V$ and using the definition of the dilution rate, $D = F/V$, a first-order ordinary differential equation is obtained:\n$$\\frac{dX_c}{dt} = -D X_c$$\nThis equation describes the washout of the initial cohort of cells. To find the concentration of these cells at a later time $t$, we integrate the equation from $t=0$ to a general time $t$:\n$$\\int_{X_c(0)}^{X_c(t)} \\frac{dX_c}{X_c} = \\int_0^t -D \\, d\\tau$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{X_c(t)}{X_c(0)}\\right) = -D t$$\n$$X_c(t) = X_c(0) \\exp(-Dt)$$\nThe fraction of the original cohort of cells remaining in the vessel at time $t$ is the ratio of the concentration at time $t$ to the initial concentration:\n$$\\text{Fraction remaining} = \\frac{X_c(t)}{X_c(0)} = \\exp(-Dt)$$\nThe fraction of the original cohort of cells that has been removed by washout at time $t$ is therefore:\n$$f(t) = 1 - \\exp(-Dt)$$\nThe problem requires this fraction to be evaluated over one generation time, $t_g$, which is defined as $t_g = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\mu}$. Substituting this specific time into the expression for the fraction removed gives the general expression in terms of $D$ and $\\mu$:\n$$f = 1 - \\exp\\left(-D \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\mu}\\right)$$\nUsing the identity $a^b = \\exp(b \\ln a)$, we can write $\\exp(-D \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\mu}) = \\exp(\\ln(2^{-D/\\mu})) = 2^{-D/\\mu}$.\nThus, the expression for the fraction of cells removed is:\n$$f = 1 - 2^{-D/\\mu}$$\nThis completes the first part of the derivation.\n\nThe second part of the task is to impose the nontrivial steady-state condition and compute the numerical value of this fraction. In a chemostat, a steady state ($\\frac{dX}{dt}=0$) can be achieved where the biomass concentration $X$ is nonzero. The general mass balance for the total biomass concentration $X$ (including growth) is $\\frac{dX}{dt} = (\\mu - D)X$.

Crucially, this relationship is derived *only* from the biomass balance and the definition of the specific growth rate. It is completely independent of the substrate balance and, therefore, independent of the Pirt relation parameters $Y_g$ and $m_s$.\n\n$2$. **Substrate Balance**: The rate of change of substrate concentration is the rate of substrate inflow minus the rate of outflow and the rate of consumption by the biomass.\n$$ \\frac{dS}{dt} = D S_{in} - D S - q_{s} X $$\nAt steady state ($\\frac{dS}{dt}=0$, $S=S^{*}$), this becomes:\n$$ D(S_{in} - S^{*}) = q_{s} X^{*} $$\nSubstituting the Pirt relation for $q_s$ and using $\\mu = D$:\n$$ D(S_{in} - S^{*}) = \\left(\\frac{D}{Y_{g}} + m_{s}\\right) X^{*} $$\nThis equation determines the steady-state biomass concentration, $X^{*}$.\n\n**Analysis of the Investigator's Estimation Procedure:**\n\n**Estimation of $\\mu_{max}$:**\nThe investigator measures pairs of $(D, S^{*})$ and fits the Monod equation form to this data. The data generated by the real physical system precisely follows the equation $D = \\mu_{max} \\frac{S^{*}}{K_{s} + S^{*}}$. The investigator's model, although neglecting maintenance overall, uses this same functional form to relate $D$ and $S^{*}$. Since the true relationship between the measured variables $(D, S^{*})$ is exactly the Monod form and does not contain the maintenance term $m_s$, fitting this form to the data will yield correct, unbiased estimates of the parameters $\\mu_{max}$ and $K_{s}$. The investigator's neglect of maintenance in their conceptual model does not affect the parameter estimates derived purely from the $S^{*}(D)$ relationship. Therefore, the estimate of $\\mu_{max}$ is unbiased.\n\n**Estimation of Biomass Yield ($Y_{x/s}$):**\nThe investigator claims to infer the biomass yield, $Y_{x/s}$, from the $S^{*}(D)$ data *alone*. Let us examine where the yield parameter appears. The true growth yield, $Y_g$, appears only in the substrate balance equation, which relates $X^{*}$ to $S^{*}$, $D$, and $S_{in}$. To estimate $Y_g$ (or any related yield concept), one must have measurements of the biomass concentration, $X^*$. The problem explicitly states that the investigator measures *only* the residual substrate concentration $S^{*}$ as a function of $D$. The data set ($D$, $S^{*}$) contains no information whatsoever about the biomass concentration $X^{*}$ and therefore no information about the yield $Y_g$. The yield parameter, $Y_{x/s}$ (representing an estimate of $Y_g$ or an observed yield), is mathematically **non-identifiable** from the specified data set. The investigator's claim to infer $Y_{x/s}$ from this data is fundamentally invalid. Any value they report for $Y_{x/s}$ cannot be derived from the stated measurements and must be based on unstated assumptions or separate data, rendering it unconstrained and potentially arbitrary within the context of the problem.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n**A. The estimate of $\\mu_{max}$ is unbiased by neglecting maintenance in $S^{*}(D)$ fitting, but $Y_{x/s}$ is not identifiable from $S^{*}(D)$ alone; any reported $Y_{x/s}$ is unconstrained and can be arbitrarily biased.**\n-   Estimate of $\\mu_{max}$ is unbiased: This is **Correct**, as derived above.\n-   $Y_{x/s}$ is not identifiable from $S^{*}(D)$ alone: This is **Correct**. The data set contains no information about yield.\n-   Any reported $Y_{x/s}$ is unconstrained: This follows directly from non-identifiability.\nThis option provides a completely accurate description of the situation.\n\n**B. Both $\\mu_{max}$ and $Y_{x/s}$ are underestimated because maintenance lowers the effective specific growth rate at a given $S^{*}$.**\nMaintenance does not alter the function $\\mu(S)$; it adds a separate term to the substrate uptake rate $q_s$. The premise that maintenance lowers the effective specific growth rate is false. Therefore, the conclusion that $\\mu_{max}$ is underestimated is incorrect. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $\\mu_{max}$ is overestimated because maintenance reduces net growth, and $Y_{x/s}$ is underestimated because maintenance consumes substrate without growth.**\nThe estimate of $\\mu_{max}$ is unbiased, not overestimated. The a priori reason given is also confused. \"Net growth\" is already accounted for in the biomass balance that leads to $\\mu = D$. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $\\mu_{max}$ is unbiased by neglecting maintenance, and $Y_{x/s}$ is systematically underestimated when inferred from $S^{*}(D)$ alone.**\nThe first part is correct. The second part, \"systematically underestimated,\" is incorrect because it implies that an estimation is possible but biased. As established, $Y_{x/s}$ is not identifiable, meaning no valid estimation procedure exists based on the given data. It is impossible to speak of an under- or overestimation for a non-estimable parameter. Option A is more precise by stating it is \"not identifiable.\" This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Both $\\mu_{max}$ and $Y_{x/s}$ are unbiased because maintenance affects only the biomass concentration $X^{*}$, not the measured $S^{*}(D)$ relationship.**\nThe reasoning provided is correct: maintenance affects $X^{*}$, not the $S^{*}(D)$ function. This leads to the correct conclusion that the $\\mu_{max}$ estimate is unbiased. However, it incorrectly concludes that the $Y_{x/s}$ estimate is also unbiased. An unbiased estimate cannot exist for a parameter that is not identifiable. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis, option A is the only one that correctly and precisely describes the consequences of the investigator's procedure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2484311"}]}
