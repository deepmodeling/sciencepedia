By comparison, the effective first-order rate constant, $k$, is:\n$$ k = \\frac{r_{\\max}}{K_{s}} $$\n\n(iii) Non-dimensionalize the governing equation to identify the Thiele modulus.\nThe governing equation for steady-state, one-dimensional diffusion with a first-order reaction in a planar slab is given by the mass balance on the substrate:\n$$ D_{e} \\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} - kC = 0 $$\nwhere $x$ is the spatial coordinate perpendicular to the electrode surface. We introduce a dimensionless concentration, $\\bar{C} = C/C_{ref}$, and a dimensionless length, $\\bar{x} = x/L$, where $C_{ref}$ is a reference concentration (e.g., the concentration at the biofilm-bulk interface) and $L$ is the characteristic length (the biofilm thickness).\nThe derivatives transform as:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dx} = \\frac{d(C_{ref}\\bar{C})}{d(L\\bar{x})} = \\frac{C_{ref}}{L} \\frac{d\\bar{C}}{d\\bar{x}} $$\n$$ \\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{C_{ref}}{L} \\frac{d\\bar{C}}{d\\bar{x}}\\right) = \\frac{C_{ref}}{L^2} \\frac{d^2\\bar{C}}{d\\bar{x}^2} $$\nSubstituting these into the governing equation:\n$$ D_{e} \\left(\\frac{C_{ref}}{L^2} \\frac{d^2\\bar{C}}{d\\bar{x}^2}\\right) - k(C_{ref}\\bar{C}) = 0 $$\nDividing by $\\frac{D_{e}C_{ref}}{L^2}$ yields the dimensionless form:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\bar{C}}{d\\bar{x}^2} - \\left(\\frac{kL^2}{D_{e}}\\right) \\bar{C} = 0 $$\nThe dimensionless group $\\frac{kL^2}{D_{e}}$ compares the characteristic rate of reaction ($kC$) to the characteristic rate of diffusion ($D_{e}C/L^2$). The square root of this group is defined as the Thiele modulus, $\\phi$, for a first-order reaction in a planar geometry.\n$$ \\phi^2 = \\frac{kL^2}{D_{e}} \\implies \\phi = L\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D_{e}}} $$\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for $k$ and $r_{\\max}$ from parts (i) and (ii) into the expression for $\\phi$:\n$$ \\phi = L\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{D_{e}} \\left(\\frac{r_{\\max}}{K_{s}}\\right)} = L\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{D_{e}K_{s}} \\left(\\frac{j_{\\mathrm{sat}}}{nFL}\\right)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{L^2 j_{\\mathrm{sat}}}{nFL D_{e}K_{s}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{L j_{\\mathrm{sat}}}{nF D_{e}K_{s}}} $$\n\nFinally, compute the numerical value of the Thiele modulus using the provided parameters in consistent SI units.\n- $L = 400\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $j_{\\mathrm{sat}} = 15.0\\,\\mathrm{A\\,m^{-2}} = 15.0\\,\\mathrm{C\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2}}$\n- $n = 8$\n- $F = 96485\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $D_{e} = 6.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}$\n- $K_{s} = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}}$\n\nFirst, calculate the first-order rate constant $k$.\n$$ r_{\\max} = \\frac{j_{\\mathrm{sat}}}{nFL} = \\frac{15.0\\,\\mathrm{C\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2}}}{8 \\cdot (96485\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}) \\cdot (4.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m})} = \\frac{15.0}{308.752}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}\\,s^{-1}} \\approx 0.048584\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}\\,s^{-1}} $$\n$$ k = \\frac{r_{\\max}}{K_{s}} = \\frac{0.048584\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}\\,s^{-1}}}{0.20\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}}} \\approx 0.24292\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} $$\nNow, calculate the Thiele modulus $\\phi$:\n$$ \\phi = L\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D_{e}}} = (4.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\sqrt{\\frac{0.24292\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}}{6.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}}} $$\n$$ \\phi = (4.0 \\times 10^{-4}) \\sqrt{4.04867 \\times 10^{8}} = (4.0 \\times 10^{-4}) \\cdot (2.0121 \\times 10^{4}) $$\n$$ \\phi \\approx 8.0485 $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the Thiele modulus is $8.05$.\n\nCommentary on the magnitude of the Thiele modulus:\nThe Thiele modulus, $\\phi \\approx 8.05$, is significantly greater than $1$. A large Thiele modulus ($\\phi \\gg 1$) indicates that the rate of reaction is much faster than the rate of diffusion. This implies that the system is strongly diffusion-limited. The acetate entering the biofilm from the bulk solution is consumed rapidly in a thin layer near the biofilm-bulk interface.\nAs a result, the acetate concentration drops to negligible levels deep within the biofilm, long before reaching the electrode surface. This means a significant portion of the biofilm's volume is \"starved\" of substrate and does not contribute to the overall reaction and current generation.\nThe effectiveness factor, $\\eta$, for this geometry is given by $\\eta = \\frac{\\tanh(\\phi)}{\\phi}$. For $\\phi = 8.05$, $\\tanh(8.05) \\approx 1$, so the effectiveness factor is $\\eta \\approx 1/8.05 \\approx 0.12$. This low value confirms that only about $12\\%$ of the catalytically active biofilm volume is effectively utilized.\nThe substrate penetration depth, $\\delta$, can be estimated as $\\delta \\approx L/\\phi$. For this system, $\\delta \\approx (400\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}) / 8.05 \\approx 49.7\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. This confirms that acetate is effectively depleted within the first $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ of the $400\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ thick biofilm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8.05}$$", "id": "2478697"}]}
