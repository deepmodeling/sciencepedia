A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing the tasks in the order presented.\n\n**Task 1: Express the serial interval $S$ as a function of the primitive random variables.**\n\nLet time $t=0$ correspond to the moment the infector is infected. The timeline of events is as follows:\n- The infector develops symptoms at time $I$.\n- The infector becomes infectious at time $L$.\n- Transmission to the infectee occurs at time $T = L + X$.\n- The infectee, having been infected at time $T$, develops symptoms after a duration of $I'$. Thus, the infectee's symptom onset occurs at absolute time $T + I'$.\n\nThe serial interval, $S$, is defined as the time elapsed from the infector's symptom onset to the infectee's symptom onset. Using the established time points:\n$$S = (\\text{Infectee symptom onset time}) - (\\text{Infector symptom onset time})$$\n$$S = (T + I') - I$$\nSubstituting the definition of the generation time $T = L + X$:\n$$S = L + X + I' - I$$\nThis expression relates the serial interval $S$ to the fundamental random variables defined in the problem.\n\n**Task 2: Derive an analytic expression for the expected serial interval $\\mathbb{E}[S]$.**\n\nWe apply the expectation operator to the expression for $S$. By the linearity of expectation, we have:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[S] = \\mathbb{E}[L + X + I' - I]$$\n$$\\mathbb{E}[S] = \\mathbb{E}[L] + \\mathbb{E}[X] + \\mathbb{E}[I'] - \\mathbb{E}[I]$$\nThe problem states that $I$, $L$, and $X$ are mutually independent, and $I'$ is an independent copy of $I$. This means that $I$ and $I'$ are independent and identically distributed, which implies $\\mathbb{E}[I'] = \\mathbb{E}[I]$. Substituting this equality into the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[S]$ yields a significant simplification:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[S] = \\mathbb{E}[L] + \\mathbb{E}[X] + \\mathbb{E}[I] - \\mathbb{E}[I]$$\n$$\\mathbb{E}[S] = \\mathbb{E}[L] + \\mathbb{E}[X]$$\nThis result demonstrates that, under the given assumptions, the expected serial interval is equal to the expected generation time, $\\mathbb{E}[T]$.\n\nWe now find the expectations of $L$ and $X$ from their specified Gamma distributions. For a random variable $Y \\sim \\mathrm{Gamma}(k, \\theta)$ with shape-scale parameterization, the expected value is $\\mathbb{E}[Y] = k\\theta$.\nFor the latent period $L \\sim \\mathrm{Gamma}(k_{L}, \\theta_{L})$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[L] = k_{L}\\theta_{L}$$\nFor the time from infectiousness to transmission $X \\sim \\mathrm{Gamma}(k_{X}, \\theta_{X})$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X] = k_{X}\\theta_{X}$$\nTherefore, the final analytic expression for the expected serial interval is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[S] = k_{L}\\theta_{L} + k_{X}\\theta_{X}$$\n\n**Task 3: Evaluate $\\mathbb{E}[S]$ numerically.**\n\nWe substitute the given parameter values into the derived expression:\n- $k_{L} = 4$, $\\theta_{L} = 0.625$\n- $k_{X} = 3$, $\\theta_{X} = 0.4$\n\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[L] = (4)(0.625) = 2.5 \\text{ days} $$\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X] = (3)(0.4) = 1.2 \\text{ days} $$\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[S] = 2.5 + 1.2 = 3.7 \\text{ days} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Thus, the numerical value for the expected serial interval is $3.700$ days.\n\n**Explanation of Pre-symptomatic Transmission Impact**\n\nThe phenomenon where the mean serial interval is shorter than the mean incubation period is a key epidemiological indicator of substantial pre-symptomatic transmission. Our derivation provides a clear framework for understanding this.\nWe found that $\\mathbb{E}[S] = \\mathbb{E}[T]$, where $T$ is the generation time. The question of why $\\mathbb{E}[S]$ can be smaller than $\\mathbb{E}[I]$ is therefore equivalent to asking why the mean generation time $\\mathbb{E}[T]$ can be smaller than the mean incubation period $\\mathbb{E}[I]$.\nPre-symptomatic transmission occurs if an individual transmits the pathogen before showing symptoms, which corresponds to the event $T  I$.\nFrom our analysis, the difference between the mean serial interval and the mean incubation period is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[S] - \\mathbb{E}[I] = \\mathbb{E}[T] - \\mathbb{E}[I]$$\nIf this difference is negative, it implies that, on average, transmission events occur before symptom onset. This is the definition of a transmission dynamic dominated by the pre-symptomatic phase.\nUsing the given parameter values, we quantify this difference:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[I] = 5.5 \\text{ days}$$\n$$\\mathbb{E}[S] = 3.7 \\text{ days}$$\nThe difference is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[S] - \\mathbb{E}[I] = 3.7 - 5.5 = -1.8 \\text{ days}$$\nThis negative value of $-1.8$ days signifies that, on average, transmission occurs $1.8$ days *before* the infector's symptom onset. The fact that $\\mathbb{E}[I]$ cancels out of the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[S]$ is a consequence of the assumed independence and identical distribution of infector and infectee incubation periods, isolating the mean serial interval to be determined solely by the properties of the transmission process itself (latency and infectiousness profile), not the host response (incubation period).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.700}$$", "id": "2490042"}, {"introduction": "Effective public health intervention requires making optimal decisions with limited resources.

The element $K_{ij}$ represents the expected number of new infections in subpopulation $i$ caused by a single infectious individual in subpopulation $j$. The transmission is frequency-dependent with proportionate mixing.\n\nAn infectious individual from group $j$ has a contact rate of $c_j$ contacts per day. Under proportionate mixing, the probability that any given contact is with an individual from group $i$ is proportional to the size of group $i$ relative to the total population, i.e., $\\frac{N_i}{N}$, where $N = N_1 + N_2$.\nThe rate at which an infectious individual from group $j$ makes contact with individuals from group $i$ is $c_j \\frac{N_i}{N}$.\nThe probability of transmission per contact is $q$. Since the population is assumed to be fully susceptible, the rate of new infections in group $i$ generated by a single infectious individual in group $j$ is $c_j \\frac{N_i}{N} q$.\nThe mean duration of infectiousness is $D$.\nTherefore, the total expected number of secondary infections in group $i$ from a single primary case in group $j$ is:\n$$ K_{ij} = \\left(c_j \\frac{N_i}{N}\\right) q D $$\nThis defines the entries of the $2 \\times 2$ next-generation matrix $K$:\n$$ K = \\begin{pmatrix} c_1 \\frac{N_1}{N} q D  c_2 \\frac{N_1}{N} q D \\\\ c_1 \\frac{N_2}{N} q D  c_2 \\frac{N_2}{N} q D \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis matrix can be expressed as the outer product of two vectors:\n$$ K = \\frac{qD}{N} \\begin{pmatrix} N_1 \\\\ N_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c_1  c_2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nNext, we incorporate the effect of vaccination. A vaccine reduces susceptibility by a factor of $1 - \\epsilon$. In subpopulation $i$, a fraction $v_i$ is vaccinated. The average susceptibility of an individual in subpopulation $i$ is a weighted average of the susceptibility of unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals: $(1-v_i) \\cdot 1 + v_i \\cdot (1-\\epsilon) = 1 - v_i + v_i - v_i\\epsilon = 1 - v_i\\epsilon$.\nVaccination only affects the susceptibility of the receiving population. Thus, the number of new infections in group $i$ is reduced by this factor. The entry $K_{v,ij}$ of the vaccinated NGM, $K_v$, is given by $K_{ij}$ multiplied by the average susceptibility of group $i$.\n$$ K_{v,ij} = K_{ij} (1 - v_i\\epsilon) $$\nThe vaccinated NGM is therefore:\n$$ K_v = \\begin{pmatrix} K_{11}(1-v_1\\epsilon)  K_{12}(1-v_1\\epsilon) \\\\ K_{21}(1-v_2\\epsilon)  K_{22}(1-v_2\\epsilon) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} c_1 \\frac{N_1}{N} q D (1-v_1\\epsilon)  c_2 \\frac{N_1}{N} q D (1-v_1\\epsilon) \\\\ c_1 \\frac{N_2}{N} q D (1-v_2\\epsilon)  c_2 \\frac{N_2}{N} q D (1-v_2\\epsilon) \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSimilar to $K$, $K_v$ is a rank-1 matrix and can be written as an outer product:\n$$ K_v = \\frac{qD}{N} \\begin{pmatrix} N_1(1-v_1\\epsilon) \\\\ N_2(1-v_2\\epsilon) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c_1  c_2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe effective reproduction number, $R_e$, is the spectral radius (dominant eigenvalue) of $K_v$.

However, the given parameters are $c_1 = 20$ and $c_2 = 5$, so $c_1 \\neq c_2$. This implies that the extremum does not occur in the interior of the feasible domain but must lie on its boundary. This is expected, as we are maximizing a linear function over a convex region (a line segment defined by the constraints). The maximum must be at one of the vertices of this feasible region.\n\nThe term $c_i$ can be seen as the \"value\" or \"return\" for vaccinating an individual in group $i$, as it is the key parameter distinguishing the two groups in the objective function. Since $c_1 > c_2$, vaccinating an individual in group $1$ gives a greater reduction in $R_e$ per dose than vaccinating an individual in group $2$. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to prioritize vaccination of the high-contact group, group $1$.\n\nWe allocate as many doses as possible to group $1$ until either all of group $1$ is vaccinated ($v_1=1$) or we run out of doses.\nThe number of doses required to fully vaccinate group $1$ is $N_1 = 1.0 \\times 10^5$.\nThe total number of available doses is $M = 1.3 \\times 10^5$.\nSince $M > N_1$, we have enough doses to fully vaccinate group $1$. Thus, the optimal fraction for group $1$ is $v_1^* = 1$.\n\nThe number of doses used for group $1$ is $N_1 v_1^* = (1.0 \\times 10^5) \\times 1 = 1.0 \\times 10^5$.\nThe number of remaining doses is $M - N_1 v_1^* = 1.3 \\times 10^5 - 1.0 \\times 10^5 = 0.3 \\times 10^5$.\nThese remaining doses are allocated to group $2$.\nThe number of individuals vaccinated in group $2$ is $N_2 v_2^* = 0.3 \\times 10^5$.\nThe population of group $2$ is $N_2 = 2.0 \\times 10^5$.\nThe fraction of group $2$ to be vaccinated is:\n$$ v_2^* = \\frac{0.3 \\times 10^5}{N_2} = \\frac{0.3 \\times 10^5}{2.0 \\times 10^5} = \\frac{0.3}{2.0} = 0.15 $$\nThe resulting allocation $(v_1^*, v_2^*) = (1, 0.15)$ satisfies all constraints: $v_1^*=1 \\in [0, 1]$, $v_2^*=0.15 \\in [0, 1]$, and $N_1 v_1^* + N_2 v_2^* = (1.0 \\times 10^5)(1) + (2.0 \\times 10^5)(0.15) = 1.0 \\times 10^5 + 0.3 \\times 10^5 = 1.3 \\times 10^5 = M$.\n\nThe optimal allocation is $v_1^* = 1$ and $v_2^* = 0.15$. The problem requires rounding each component to four significant figures.\n$v_1^* = 1.000$\n$v_2^* = 0.1500$\n\nThe final optimal allocation is the row vector $(1.000, 0.1500)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.000  0.1500\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2490026"}]}
