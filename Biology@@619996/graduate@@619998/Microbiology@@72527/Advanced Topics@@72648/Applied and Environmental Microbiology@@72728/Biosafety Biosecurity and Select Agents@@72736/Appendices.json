It is a standard, solvable problem in classical aerosol mechanics. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by addressing the three components of the problem.\n\n1) Derivation of the terminal settling velocity, $v_{s}$.\nAt terminal velocity, the net force on the particle is zero, indicating a state of dynamic equilibrium. The forces acting on the particle are the gravitational force ($F_{g}$) acting downward, the buoyant force ($F_{b}$) acting upward, and the viscous drag force ($F_{d}$) acting upward, opposing the direction of motion. The force balance equation is:\n$$F_{g} = F_{b} + F_{d}$$\nThe gravitational force is the product of the particle's mass ($m_{p}$) and gravitational acceleration ($g$). The particle's mass is the product of its density ($\\rho_{p}$) and volume ($V_{p}$). For a sphere of diameter $d$, the volume is $V_{p} = \\frac{1}{6}\\pi d^3$.\n$$F_{g} = m_{p}g = \\rho_{p}V_{p}g = \\rho_{p}\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\pi d^3\\right)g$$\nThe buoyant force, according to Archimedes' principle, is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the particle. This is the product of the fluid density ($\\rho_{f}$), the particle volume ($V_{p}$), and gravitational acceleration ($g$).\n$$F_{b} = \\rho_{f}V_{p}g = \\rho_{f}\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\pi d^3\\right)g$$\nThe viscous drag force is given by Stokes' law for a sphere in creeping flow (low Reynolds number), which is stated to be applicable.\n$$F_{d} = 3\\pi\\mu d v_{s}$$\nwhere $v_{s}$ is the terminal settling velocity.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the force balance equation:\n$$\\rho_{p}\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\pi d^3\\right)g = \\rho_{f}\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\pi d^3\\right)g + 3\\pi\\mu d v_{s}$$\nTo solve for $v_{s}$, we first isolate the drag term:\n$$3\\pi\\mu d v_{s} = \\rho_{p}\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\pi d^3\\right)g - \\rho_{f}\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\pi d^3\\right)g$$\n$$3\\pi\\mu d v_{s} = (\\rho_{p} - \\rho_{f})\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\pi d^3\\right)g$$\nNow, we solve for $v_{s}$:\n$$v_{s} = \\frac{(\\rho_{p} - \\rho_{f})\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\pi d^3\\right)g}{3\\pi\\mu d}$$\nSimplifying the expression by canceling common terms ($\\pi$ and one factor of $d$):\n$$v_{s} = \\frac{(\\rho_{p} - \\rho_{f}) d^2 g}{18\\mu}$$\nThis is the required expression for the terminal settling velocity under the given assumptions.\n\n2) Numerical evaluation of $v_{s}$.\nWe substitute the given physical parameters into the derived expression:\n$d = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\text{m}$\n$\\rho_{p} = 1.200 \\times 10^{3} \\,\\text{kg}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-3}$\n$\\rho_{f} = 1.20 \\,\\text{kg}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-3}$\n$\\mu = 1.80 \\times 10^{-5} \\,\\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}$\n$g = 9.80665 \\,\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-2}$\n\n$$v_{s} = \\frac{((1.200 \\times 10^{3}) - 1.20) \\, (\\text{kg}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-3}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\text{m})^2 \\times (9.80665 \\,\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-2})}{18 \\times (1.80 \\times 10^{-5} \\,\\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s})}$$\nFirst, compute the effective density difference and the denominator:\n$(\\rho_{p} - \\rho_{f}) = 1200 - 1.20 = 1198.8 \\,\\text{kg}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-3}$\n$18\\mu = 18 \\times (1.80 \\times 10^{-5}) = 3.24 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the expression for $v_{s}$:\n$$v_{s} = \\frac{(1198.8) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times (9.80665)}{3.24 \\times 10^{-4}} \\,\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}$$\n$$v_{s} = \\frac{11756.2422 \\times 10^{-12}}{3.24 \\times 10^{-4}} \\,\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}$$\n$$v_{s} = \\frac{1.17562422 \\times 10^{-8}}{3.24 \\times 10^{-4}} \\,\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1} \\approx 0.362847 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}$$\n$$v_{s} \\approx 3.62847 \\times 10^{-5} \\,\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested:\n$$v_{s} \\approx 3.63 \\times 10^{-5} \\,\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}$$\n\n3) Explanation of the breakdown of the no-slip condition.\nThe Stokes drag law is derived under the continuum hypothesis, which treats the fluid as a continuous medium. A key assumption of this model is the no-slip boundary condition, which states that the layer of fluid in direct contact with a solid surface has zero velocity relative to that surface. This assumption holds true when the characteristic length scale of the object, in this case the particle diameter $d$, is much larger than the average distance a fluid molecule travels between collisions, known as the mean free path $\\lambda$.\n\nThe breakdown of the no-slip condition occurs when $d$ is no longer significantly larger than $\\lambda$. At such scales, the discrete, molecular nature of the fluid becomes apparent. The particle is small enough to move through the \"gaps\" between gas molecules, and collisions with the surface are not frequent enough to enforce a zero relative velocity. Gas molecules impinging on the particle surface do not fully accommodate to its velocity before rebounding, leading to a \"slip\" of the gas flow past the surface. This phenomenon reduces the momentum transfer between the particle and the fluid, resulting in a lower drag force than predicted by the classical Stokes' law.\n\nThe degree to which the continuum assumption breaks down is quantified by the dimensionless Knudsen number, $K_{n}$. As per the problem's definition, we take this as the ratio of the molecular mean free path to the characteristic particle length:\n$$K_{n} = \\frac{\\lambda}{d}$$\n(Note: a common definition in aerosol science is $K_{n} = 2\\lambda/d$, but we adhere to the problem's phrasing.)\n\nBased on the value of $K_{n}$, flow regimes are classified. Slip effects become non-negligible when $K_{n}$ is no longer negligibly small compared to unity. A common engineering threshold for the onset of the \"slip-flow\" regime, where corrections to the continuum model are required, is approximately $K_{n} \\gtrsim 0.01$ to $0.1$. Below this, in the continuum regime ($K_{n} \\lesssim 0.01$), the no-slip condition and Stokes' law are highly accurate.\n\nTo estimate the approximate particle diameter scale at which slip effects become non-negligible, we can use the threshold where the flow transitions from a continuum-like behavior. Let us select a conservative but standard threshold of $K_{n} \\approx 0.1$. At this point, the particle diameter $d$ is:\n$$d \\approx \\frac{\\lambda}{0.1} = 10\\lambda$$\nUsing the given value $\\lambda = 65 \\,\\text{nm}$:\n$$d \\approx 10 \\times (65 \\,\\text{nm}) = 650 \\,\\text{nm} = 0.65 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\text{m}$$\nTherefore, for particles with diameters on the order of or smaller than approximately $0.65 \\,\\text{\\mu m}$, slip effects become significant and a slip correction factor (e.g., the Cunningham correction factor) must be applied to Stokes' law to accurately predict the drag force and settling velocity. For the particle in this problem, with $d = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\text{m}$, the Knudsen number is $K_{n} = (65 \\times 10^{-9}) / (1.0 \\times 10^{-6}) = 0.065$. This value falls squarely in the slip-flow regime, confirming that slip correction would be necessary for a more precise analysis, even though the problem as stated restricts the calculation to the uncorrected Stokes' law.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.63 \\times 10^{-5}}$$", "id": "2480294"}, {"introduction": "Effective containment relies on robust engineering controls.

It is based on the fundamental principle of conservation of mass applied to a CSTR (Continuously Stirred-Tank Reactor) model, which is a standard and valid approach for modeling well-mixed indoor air environments. All necessary parameters are provided, and the problem is free of logical contradictions, pseudoscience, or ambiguity. Therefore, we may proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires the formulation and solution of a mass balance equation for the concentration of a tracer aerosol, $C(t)$, in a well-mixed room of volume $V$. The fundamental principle is the conservation of mass, which can be stated as:\n\nRate of Accumulation = Rate of Generation - Rate of Removal\n\nLet $N(t)$ be the total number of aerosol particles in the room at time $t$.

Removal by exhaust: Air is exhausted to the outside at a rate of $a_{\\mathrm{out}}$ air changes per hour. The volumetric flow rate of this exhaust is $q_{\\mathrm{out}} = a_{\\mathrm{out}} V$. Since the room is well-mixed, the concentration of the air leaving the room is $C(t)$. The rate of particle removal by exhaust is therefore:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Removal}_{\\mathrm{out}} = q_{\\mathrm{out}} C(t) = a_{\\mathrm{out}} V C(t)\n$$\n$2$. Removal by filtration: Air is recirculated through a HEPA filter at a rate of $a_{\\mathrm{recirc}}$ air changes per hour. The volumetric flow rate is $q_{\\mathrm{recirc}} = a_{\\mathrm{recirc}} V$. The filter removes particles with a single-pass efficiency of $\\eta$. Thus, the rate of particle removal by the filtration system is the fraction $\\eta$ of the particles passing through it:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Removal}_{\\mathrm{recirc}} = \\eta q_{\\mathrm{recirc}} C(t) = \\eta a_{\\mathrm{recirc}} V C(t)\n$$\nThe total rate of removal is the sum of these two rates:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Removal} = (a_{\\mathrm{out}} V + \\eta a_{\\mathrm{recirc}} V) C(t)\n$$\nSubstituting these terms into the mass balance equation yields:\n$$\nV \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = Q - (a_{\\mathrm{out}} V + \\eta a_{\\mathrm{recirc}} V) C(t)\n$$\nTo obtain the requested form, we divide the entire equation by the volume $V$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = \\frac{Q}{V} - (a_{\\mathrm{out}} + \\eta a_{\\mathrm{recirc}}) C(t)\n$$\nThis equation describes the time evolution of the room-averaged concentration $C(t)$. The problem asks to express this in terms of an aggregate first-order removal coefficient $\\lambda$.

The second term is not the full recirculation rate but is scaled by the filter's efficiency $\\eta$ to account for the fraction of particles actually removed from the airstream. The units of $\\lambda$ are inverse time (e.g., $\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$).\n\nTo find the steady-state concentration, $C^{\\ast}$, we set the rate of change of concentration to zero, $\\frac{dC^{\\ast}}{dt} = 0$.

This is expressed as the inequality:\n$$R_{\\text{admin}} \\le R_{\\text{eng}}$$\n\nFirst, we define the baseline annual risk, $R_{\\text{eng}}$.

The PFD of the administrative control set, which consists of $m$ independent steps, is given by $p_{A}$. The set fails if any of its $m$ steps fail. The probability that a single step succeeds is $(1-h)$. The probability that all $m$ independent steps succeed is $(1-h)^m$. Therefore, the probability of failure of the set (its PFD) is:\n$$p_{A} = 1 - (1 - h)^{m}$$\nThe model states that the per-task probability of exposure is the product of the base probability $p_b$ and the PFD of the control in use. Thus, for administrative controls:\n$$p_{\\text{task, admin}} = p_{b} \\times p_{A} = p_{b} [1 - (1 - h)^{m}]$$\nThe annual risk, assuming the number of tasks $N$ remains constant, is:\n$$R_{\\text{admin}} = 1 - (1 - p_{\\text{task, admin}})^{N} = 1 - (1 - p_{b}[1 - (1 - h)^{m}])^{N}$$\n\nNow, we enforce the risk principle by substituting these expressions into the inequality $R_{\\text{admin}} \\le R_{\\text{eng}}$:\n$$1 - (1 - p_{b}[1 - (1 - h)^{m}])^{N} \\le 1 - (1 - p_{b} p_{E})^{N}$$\nSubtracting $1$ from both sides gives:\n$$-(1 - p_{b}[1 - (1 - h)^{m}])^{N} \\le -(1 - p_{b} p_{E})^{N}$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality:\n$$(1 - p_{b}[1 - (1 - h)^{m}])^{N} \\ge (1 - p_{b} p_{E})^{N}$$\nThe base of the exponents on both sides, $(1-p_{\\text{task}})$, is a positive number less than $1$. The exponent $N$ is a positive integer ($N=300$). We can therefore take the $N$-th root of both sides without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$1 - p_{b}[1 - (1 - h)^{m}] \\ge 1 - p_{b} p_{E}$$\nSubtracting $1$ from both sides yields:\n$$-p_{b}[1 - (1 - h)^{m}] \\ge -p_{b} p_{E}$$\nThe base probability $p_{b}$ is given as $2 \\times 10^{-3}$, which is a positive number. Dividing both sides by $-p_{b}$ reverses the inequality again:\n$$1 - (1 - h)^{m} \\le p_{E}$$\nThis result is logical: for the annual risk to be no greater, the per-task probability of failure of the administrative controls ($p_A = 1 - (1-h)^m$) must be no greater than the per-task probability of failure of the engineering control ($p_E$).\n\nWe now solve for $h$ to find its upper bound, $h_{\\max}$.\n$$-(1 - h)^{m} \\le p_{E} - 1$$\n$$(1 - h)^{m} \\ge 1 - p_{E}$$\nThe exponent $m$ is a positive integer ($m=3$). We can take the $m$-th root of both sides.\n$$1 - h \\ge (1 - p_{E})^{1/m}$$\nRearranging to isolate $h$:\n$$-h \\ge (1 - p_{E})^{1/m} - 1$$\n$$h \\le 1 - (1 - p_{E})^{1/m}$$\nThis gives the closed-form expression for the maximum allowable human error probability, $h_{\\max}$:\n$$h_{\\max} = 1 - (1 - p_{E})^{1/m}$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate this expression numerically using the given parameters $p_{E} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}$ and $m = 3$.\n$$h_{\\max} = 1 - (1 - 1 \\times 10^{-3})^{1/3}$$\n$$h_{\\max} = 1 - (1 - 0.001)^{1/3}$$\n$$h_{\\max} = 1 - (0.999)^{1/3}$$\nCalculating the value:\n$$(0.999)^{1/3} \\approx 0.99966655546...$$\n$$h_{\\max} \\approx 1 - 0.99966655546...$$\n$$h_{\\max} \\approx 0.00033344453...$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final numeric answer to four significant figures.\n$$h_{\\max} \\approx 0.0003334$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0003334}$$", "id": "2480282"}]}
