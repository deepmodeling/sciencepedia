This practice focuses on quantifying the electron donor demand for anaerobic reductive dechlorination, a critical process for treating common groundwater contaminants like perchloroethene (PCE). By applying the fundamental method of redox half-reactions, you will develop the essential skill of determining the precise amount of amendment (in this case, hydrogen gas) required to completely detoxify a given amount of contaminant, a foundational calculation for designing in situ remediation systems [@problem_id:2508492].", "problem": "In anaerobic aquifers, reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes by organohalide-respiring microorganisms sequentially converts perchloroethene (PCE; chemical formula $\\mathrm{C_2Cl_4}$) to trichloroethene (TCE; $\\mathrm{C_2HCl_3}$), to dichloroethene (DCE; $\\mathrm{C_2H_2Cl_2}$), to vinyl chloride (VC; $\\mathrm{C_2H_3Cl}$), and finally to ethene ($\\mathrm{C_2H_4}$). Assume the following conditions: strictly anoxic, aqueous, circumneutral pH such that protons are available from water, hydrogen gas $\\left(\\mathrm{H_2}\\right)$ is the sole electron donor, and there are no side reactions (for example, no methanogenesis or acetogenesis) and no net biomass assimilation of electrons. Use conservation of mass and charge and the standard redox half-reaction approach as the fundamental base.\n\nStarting only from these principles, derive the minimal theoretical electron donor demand as hydrogen for the complete conversion of PCE to ethene along the sequence PCE $\\rightarrow$ TCE $\\rightarrow$ DCE $\\rightarrow$ VC $\\rightarrow$ ethene. Express your final answer as a single number in mmol $\\mathrm{H_2}$ per mmol PCE. No rounding is necessary; report the exact value. The unit for the final answer is mmol $\\mathrm{H_2}$ per mmol PCE.", "solution": "The objective is to determine the minimal theoretical electron donor demand, expressed as moles of hydrogen gas ($\\mathrm{H_2}$) required for the complete reductive dechlorination of one mole of perchloroethene ($\\mathrm{C_2Cl_4}$) to ethene ($\\mathrm{C_2H_4}$). This is a stoichiometric problem that can be solved by constructing and balancing the relevant redox half-reactions.\n\nFirst, we establish the reduction half-reaction for the conversion of PCE to ethene. The reaction occurs in an aqueous environment where protons ($\\mathrm{H^+}$) are available.\n\n1.  Begin with the unbalanced skeletal equation for the transformation of the carbon-containing species:\n    $$ \\mathrm{C_2Cl_4} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{C_2H_4} $$\n\n2.  Balance the atoms other than oxygen ($O$) and hydrogen ($H$). The carbon ($C$) atoms are already balanced with $2$ on each side. The chlorine ($Cl$) atoms are not. We balance them by adding $4$ chloride ions ($\\mathrm{Cl^-}$) to the product side:\n    $$ \\mathrm{C_2Cl_4} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{C_2H_4} + 4\\mathrm{Cl^-} $$\n\n3.  Balance the hydrogen ($H$) atoms. There are $0$ hydrogen atoms on the reactant side and $4$ on the product side. We balance this by adding $4$ protons ($\\mathrm{H^+}$) to the reactant side:\n    $$ \\mathrm{C_2Cl_4} + 4\\mathrm{H^+} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{C_2H_4} + 4\\mathrm{Cl^-} $$\n\n4.  Balance the electric charge. The total charge on the reactant side is $4 \\times (+1) = +4$. The total charge on the product side is $4 \\times (-1) = -4$. To balance the charge, we must add electrons ($e^-$) to the more positive (reactant) side. The difference in charge is $(+4) - (-4) = 8$. Therefore, we add $8$ electrons to the reactant side.\n    $$ \\mathrm{C_2Cl_4} + 4\\mathrm{H^+} + 8e^- \\rightarrow \\mathrm{C_2H_4} + 4\\mathrm{Cl^-} $$\n    The mass and charge are now balanced. This is the complete reduction half-reaction. It shows that $8$ moles of electrons are required to reduce $1$ mole of $\\mathrm{C_2Cl_4}$ to $\\mathrm{C_2H_4}$.\n\nSecond, we establish the oxidation half-reaction for the electron donor, which is hydrogen gas ($\\mathrm{H_2}$).\n\n1.  The skeletal equation for the oxidation of hydrogen gas is:\n    $$ \\mathrm{H_2} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H^+} $$\n\n2.  Balance the hydrogen atoms:\n    $$ \\mathrm{H_2} \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{H^+} $$\n\n3.  Balance the electric charge. The reactant side has a charge of $0$, and the product side has a charge of $2 \\times (+1) = +2$. We add $2$ electrons to the product side to balance the charge:\n    $$ \\mathrm{H_2} \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{H^+} + 2e^- $$\n    This is the complete oxidation half-reaction. It indicates that $1$ mole of $\\mathrm{H_2}$ donates $2$ moles of electrons.\n\nFinally, we combine the two half-reactions to determine the overall stoichiometry. The number of electrons lost in the oxidation half-reaction must equal the number of electrons gained in the reduction half-reaction.\n\nThe reduction requires $8$ moles of electrons. The oxidation of one mole of $\\mathrm{H_2}$ provides $2$ moles of electrons. To provide the required $8$ moles of electrons, we must multiply the oxidation half-reaction by a factor of $\\frac{8}{2} = 4$:\n$$ 4(\\mathrm{H_2} \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{H^+} + 2e^-) \\quad \\implies \\quad 4\\mathrm{H_2} \\rightarrow 8\\mathrm{H^+} + 8e^- $$\n\nNow, we sum the balanced reduction half-reaction and the scaled oxidation half-reaction:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcr}\n   \\text{Reduction:} & \\mathrm{C_2Cl_4} + 4\\mathrm{H^+} + 8e^- & \\rightarrow & \\mathrm{C_2H_4} + 4\\mathrm{Cl^-} \\\\\n   \\text{Oxidation:} & 4\\mathrm{H_2} & \\rightarrow & 8\\mathrm{H^+} + 8e^- \\\\\n   \\hline\n   \\text{Overall:} & \\mathrm{C_2Cl_4} + 4\\mathrm{H_2} + 4\\mathrm{H^+} + 8e^- & \\rightarrow & \\mathrm{C_2H_4} + 4\\mathrm{Cl^-} + 8\\mathrm{H^+} + 8e^-\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nWe cancel species that appear on both sides of the equation ($8e^-$ and $4\\mathrm{H^+}$):\n$$ \\mathrm{C_2Cl_4} + 4\\mathrm{H_2} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{C_2H_4} + 4\\mathrm{Cl^-} + 4\\mathrm{H^+} $$\n\nThis final balanced overall reaction shows that $1$ mole of perchloroethene ($\\mathrm{C_2Cl_4}$) reacts completely with $4$ moles of hydrogen gas ($\\mathrm{H_2}$). Therefore, the minimal theoretical electron donor demand is a molar ratio of $4:1$.\n\nThe question asks for the answer in mmol $\\mathrm{H_2}$ per mmol PCE. The ratio of moles is equivalent to the ratio of millimoles. Thus, the value is $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "2508492"}, {"introduction": "Many xenobiotics are degraded not as a primary food source, but through the more complex process of cometabolism. This exercise delves into the quantitative challenges of such scenarios, where a primary substrate like methane must be supplied to drive the transformation of a target pollutant like trichloroethylene (TCE).
