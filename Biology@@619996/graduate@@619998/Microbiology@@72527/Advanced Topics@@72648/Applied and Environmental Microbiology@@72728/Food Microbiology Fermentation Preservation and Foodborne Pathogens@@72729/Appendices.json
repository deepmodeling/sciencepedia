I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to determine the total concentration of sodium benzoate required to achieve a specific concentration of its active undissociated form, benzoic acid, at a given pH. This involves three steps: first, to derive the relationship between the fraction of undissociated acid and the system's pH; second, to calculate the total molar concentration needed; and third, to convert this molar concentration to a mass concentration.\n\nThe equilibrium of the weak acid, benzoic acid ($\\mathrm{HB}$), is given by:\n$$ \\mathrm{HB} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{H}^{+} + \\mathrm{B}^{-} $$\nThe acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, is defined by the mass action law:\n$$ K_{a} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}][\\mathrm{B}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{HB}]} $$\nwhere $[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]$, $[\\mathrm{B}^{-}]$, and $[\\mathrm{HB}]$ are the molar concentrations of the hydrogen ion, the benzoate ion, and undissociated benzoic acid, respectively.\n\nThe first task is to derive an expression for the fraction of the total benzoate present as the undissociated acid, $f_{\\mathrm{HA}}$, which is defined as:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{HA}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{HB}]}{C_{\\text{tot}}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{HB}]}{[\\mathrm{HB}] + [\\mathrm{B}^{-}]} $$\nFrom the expression for $K_a$, we can express the concentration of the benzoate ion, $[\\mathrm{B}^{-}]$, as:\n$$ [\\mathrm{B}^{-}] = K_{a} \\frac{[\\mathrm{HB}]}{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]} $$\nSubstituting this expression into the denominator of the equation for $f_{\\mathrm{HA}}$ yields:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{HA}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{HB}]}{[\\mathrm{HB}] + K_{a} \\frac{[\\mathrm{HB}]}{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]}} $$\nAssuming $[\\mathrm{HB}]$ is non-zero, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by $[\\mathrm{HB}]$:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{HA}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{K_{a}}{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]}} $$\nThis expression can be rewritten by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]$, giving the equivalent form:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{HA}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]}{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}] + K_{a}} $$\nTo express $f_{\\mathrm{HA}}$ in terms of $\\mathrm{pH}$ and $\\mathrm{p}K_a$, we use the definitions $\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H}^{+}])$ and $\\mathrm{p}K_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)$.

We will address them in sequence.\n\nTask 1: Determination of the isothermal holding time.\n\nThe relationship between the decimal reduction time, $D_T$, at a temperature $T$ and the decimal reduction time, $D_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, at a reference temperature $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is given by the Bigelow model:\n$$\nD_T = D_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\times 10^{\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{ref}} - T}{z}}\n$$\nHere, the givens are $D_{\\mathrm{ref}} = D_{121.1} = 0.21\\,\\mathrm{min}$, $T_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 121.1\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, the process temperature is $T = 118.0\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, and the $z$-value is $z=10.0\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the decimal reduction time at the process temperature, $D_{118.0}$:\n$$\nD_{118.0} = D_{121.1} \\times 10^{\\frac{121.1 - 118.0}{10.0}} = 0.21 \\times 10^{\\frac{3.1}{10.0}} = 0.21 \\times 10^{0.31}\\,\\mathrm{min}\n$$\nThe required process must deliver a lethality equivalent to a $12D$ reduction at the reference temperature. A $12D$ process is designed to achieve $12$ decimal (log-base-$10$) reductions of the target microbial population. The time required to achieve $N$ log reductions at a constant temperature $T$ is given by $t = N \\times D_T$.\n\nIn this case, the number of required log reductions is $N=12$. The holding time, $t_{118}$, at $T=118.0\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ is therefore:\n$$\nt_{118} = 12 \\times D_{118.0} = 12 \\times (0.21 \\times 10^{0.31}) = 2.52 \\times 10^{0.31}\\,\\mathrm{min}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\nt_{118} \\approx 2.52 \\times 2.0417 \\approx 5.145\\,\\mathrm{min}\n$$\nThis is the required isothermal holding time for the process.\n\nTask 2: Computation of the unconditional probability of spoilage.\n\nThe spoilage endpoint is defined as the presence of at least one viable spore of proteolytic *Clostridium botulinum* in a can. Such a spore can be present either as a survivor of the thermal process or as a result of post-process contamination. Let $A$ be the event that a can contains at least one viable spore. We seek to find $P(A)$.\n\nIt is computationally simpler to calculate the probability of the complement event, $A^c$, which is that a can contains zero viable spores, and then use the relation $P(A) = 1 - P(A^c)$.\n\nLet $N_f$ be the number of spores surviving the thermal process, and let $N_c$ be the number of spores introduced by post-process contamination. The total number of viable spores is $N_{total} = N_f + N_c$. The event $A^c$ is equivalent to $\\{N_{total}=0\\}$, which occurs if and only if both $N_f=0$ and $N_c=0$. The initial bioburden and the post-process contamination are independent events. Therefore, the number of survivors $N_f$ and the number of contaminants $N_c$ are independent random variables.\n$$\nP(A^c) = P(N_f=0 \\text{ and } N_c=0) = P(N_f=0) \\times P(N_c=0)\n$$\n\nFirst, we determine $P(N_f=0)$. The initial number of spores, $N_0$, follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda_{0}=1.0$. The thermal process achieves a $12D$ reduction, meaning the probability of a single spore surviving is $p_s = 10^{-12}$. The number of survivors, $N_f$, from an initial Poisson-distributed population that undergoes binomial survival is also Poisson-distributed with a new mean $\\lambda_f = \\lambda_0 \\times p_s$. This is a result of the thinning property of Poisson processes.\n$$\n\\lambda_f = 1.0 \\times 10^{-12}\n$$\nThe probability of zero survivors is therefore:\n$$\nP(N_f=0) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda_f) \\lambda_f^0}{0!} = \\exp(-\\lambda_f) = \\exp(-1.0 \\times 10^{-12})\n$$\n\nNext, we determine $P(N_c=0)$. The introduction of contaminating spores depends on whether a sealing defect occurs. Let $D$ be the event of a defect, with probability $P(D) = p_{\\mathrm{def}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}$. The event of no defect is $D^c$, with probability $P(D^c) = 1 - p_{\\mathrm{def}}$.\nUsing the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(N_c=0) = P(N_c=0 | D)P(D) + P(N_c=0 | D^c)P(D^c)\n$$\nIf a defect occurs ($D$), the number of contaminating spores is Poisson-distributed with mean $\\lambda_c=2.0$. The probability of zero contaminants is $P(N_c=0 | D) = \\exp(-\\lambda_c) = \\exp(-2.0)$.\nIf no defect occurs ($D^c$), no spores are introduced, so $N_c=0$ with certainty. Thus, $P(N_c=0 | D^c)=1$.\nSubstituting these into the equation:\n$$\nP(N_c=0) = \\exp(-2.0) \\times p_{\\mathrm{def}} + 1 \\times (1 - p_{\\mathrm{def}})\n$$\n$$\nP(N_c=0) = (1 - p_{\\mathrm{def}}) + p_{\\mathrm{def}}\\exp(-2.0) = 1 - p_{\\mathrm{def}}(1 - \\exp(-2.0))\n$$\n\nNow we combine the probabilities:\n$$\nP(A^c) = P(N_f=0) \\times P(N_c=0) = \\exp(-1.0 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times \\left[1 - p_{\\mathrm{def}}(1 - \\exp(-2.0))\\right]\n$$\nThe total probability of at least one spore is $P(A) = 1 - P(A^c)$:\n$$\nP(A) = 1 - \\exp(-1.0 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times \\left[1 - (2.0 \\times 10^{-6})(1 - \\exp(-2.0))\\right]\n$$\nWe can analyze the magnitude of the terms.

Derivation of the Phenomenological Model**\n\nThe survival of microorganisms under a lethal agent is described by the survival function $S(t)$, which gives the probability of a single organism surviving past time $t$. It is related to the time-dependent hazard function $h(t)$ by the fundamental relation:\n$$\nS(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_{0}^{t} h(u)\\,du\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that the survival kinetics follow a Weibull model. The hazard function for the Weibull distribution of inactivation times is given by:\n$$\nh(t) = \\frac{p}{\\delta} \\left(\\frac{t}{\\delta}\\right)^{p-1}\n$$\nHere, $\\delta$ is the scale parameter (in units of time, minutes) and $p$ is the shape parameter (dimensionless). The parameter $p$ characterizes the shape of the survival curve: $p  1$ corresponds to a \"shoulder\" (low initial inactivation rate), $p = 1$ corresponds to exponential (log-linear) inactivation, and $p  1$ corresponds to a \"tail\" (high initial inactivation rate).\n\nTo derive the survival function $S(t)$, we integrate the hazard function:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} h(u)\\,du = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{p}{\\delta} \\left(\\frac{u}{\\delta}\\right)^{p-1} du = \\frac{p}{\\delta^p} \\int_{0}^{t} u^{p-1} du = \\frac{p}{\\delta^p} \\left[ \\frac{u^p}{p} \\right]_{0}^{t} = \\frac{p}{\\delta^p} \\frac{t^p}{p} = \\left(\\frac{t}{\\delta}\\right)^p\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the expression for $S(t)$ yields the Weibull survival model:\n$$\nS(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{t}{\\delta}\\right)^p\\right)\n$$\nThe expected microbial concentration at time $t$, $N(t)$, is the product of the initial concentration $N_0$ and the survival function:\n$$\nN(t) = N_0 \\, S(t) = N_0 \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{t}{\\delta}\\right)^p\\right)\n$$\n\n**2. Formulation of the Estimation Procedure**\n\nThe problem provides replicate counts of colony-forming units (CFU), $C_{ij}$, for various times $t_i$. It specifies that the measurement noise is multiplicative, which implies that the log-transformed counts are normally distributed around the log-transformed expected value. Let $y_{ij} = \\ln(C_{ij})$ be the natural logarithm of the observed count. The statistical model is:\n$$\ny_{ij} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\ln(N(t_i)), \\sigma^2\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{N}$ denotes the normal distribution and $\\sigma^2$ is the variance of the log-transformed counts, assumed to be constant.\n\nThe model for the expected log-count is:\n$$\n\\ln(N(t_i)) = \\ln(N_0) - \\left(\\frac{t_i}{\\delta}\\right)^p\n$$\nTo estimate the parameters $\\delta$ and $p$, we use the method of maximum likelihood. Maximizing the likelihood for a normal distribution is equivalent to minimizing the sum of squared residuals (SSR) between the observed log-counts $y_{ij}$ and the predicted log-counts $\\ln(N(t_i))$. The objective function to be minimized is:\n$$\n\\text{SSR}(\\delta, p, N_0) = \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} \\left( y_{ij} - \\left(\\ln(N_0) - \\left(\\frac{t_i}{\\delta}\\right)^p\\right) \\right)^2\n$$\nThe problem specifies that $N_0$ is to be estimated non-parametrically as the geometric mean of the counts at $t=0$. The geometric mean corresponds to the arithmetic mean in log-space. Let $y_{0j}$ be the log-counts at $t_i=0$. The estimate for $\\ln(N_0)$ is:\n$$\n\\ln(\\hat{N}_0) = \\frac{1}{k_0} \\sum_{j=1}^{k_0} y_{0j}\n$$\nwhere $k_0$ is the number of replicates at $t=0$. Substituting this fixed value $\\ln(\\hat{N}_0)$ into the SSR expression, the objective function depends only on $\\delta$ and $p$:\n$$\n\\text{SSR}(\\delta, p) = \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} \\left( y_{ij} - \\left(\\ln(\\hat{N}_0) - \\left(\\frac{t_i}{\\delta}\\right)^p\\right) \\right)^2\n$$\nThe summation is over all data points $(i, j)$. The contribution to the SSR from the data at $t_i=0$ is $\\sum_{j} (y_{0j} - \\ln(\\hat{N}_0))^2$, which is constant with respect to $\\delta$ and $p$. Therefore, minimizing the total SSR is equivalent to minimizing the SSR over the data points with $t_i  0$. The parameters $\\delta$ and $p$ must be positive.\n\n**3. Numerical Implementation Strategy**\n\nThe estimation of $\\delta$ and $p$ requires solving a nonlinear least-squares problem. A robust numerical procedure is necessary, as such problems can be sensitive to the initial parameter guesses provided to the optimization algorithm. A two-step approach is scientifically sound:\n1.  **Obtain a Robust Initial Guess**: The Weibull model can be linearized by a double-logarithmic transformation. Let $\\hat{N}_t$ be the geometric mean of counts at time $t$. Then $\\hat{S}(t) = \\hat{N}_t / \\hat{N}_0$.\n    $$\n    -\\ln(\\hat{S}(t)) = \\left(\\frac{t}{\\delta}\\right)^p \\implies \\ln(-\\ln(\\hat{S}(t))) = p\\ln(t) - p\\ln(\\delta)\n    $$\n    This is a linear relationship of the form $Y = mX + c$, where $Y = \\ln(-\\ln(\\hat{S}(t)))$, $X = \\ln(t)$, the slope is $m=p$, and the intercept is $c=-p\\ln(\\delta)$. A linear regression on the transformed mean data provides initial estimates $p_0 = m$ and $\\delta_0 = \\exp(-c/m)$.\n2.  **Nonlinear Optimization**: Use the initial guess $(\\delta_0, p_0)$ to start a numerical optimization of the full SSR function, which uses all replicate data points. A quasi-Newton method such as L-BFGS-B is suitable, as it can handle the positivity constraints $\\delta  0$ and $p  0$.\n\nThis procedure is implemented for each of the three provided datasets. The following program calculates the parameters $(\\delta, p)$ according to this derived method.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to process all datasets and print the final results.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Data Definitions ---\n    # Dataset A (shoulder-like kinetics)\n    times_A = [0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120]\n    counts_A = {\n        0: [510000, 490000, 505000],\n        15: [410000, 382000, 398000],\n        30: [300000, 280000, 295000],\n        60: [150000, 139000, 142000],\n        90: [70000, 62000, 66000],\n        120: [31000, 27000, 29000],\n    }\n\n    # Dataset B (boundary case, approximately exponential)\n    times_B = [0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180]\n    counts_B = {\n        0: [2050000, 1950000, 2000000],\n        30: [1250000, 1180000, 1210000],\n        60: [760000, 720000, 740000],\n        90: [460000, 430000, 450000],\n        120: [285000, 260000, 275000],\n        180: [105000, 95000, 100000],\n    }\n\n    # Dataset C (tail-like kinetics)\n    times_C = [0, 20, 40, 60, 90, 120]\n    counts_C = {\n        0: [1020000, 980000, 1000000],\n        20: [690000, 650000, 680000],\n        40: [540000, 500000, 520000],\n        60: [430000, 410000, 420000],\n        90: [330000, 310000, 320000],\n        120: [260000, 240000, 250000],\n    }\n    \n    test_cases = [\n        (times_A, counts_A),\n        (times_B, counts_B),\n        (times_C, counts_C),\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n    for times, counts in test_cases:\n        params = estimate_weibull_parameters(times, counts)\n        all_results.append(params)\n    \n    # Format according to spec: [[d1,p1],[d2,p2],...]\n    output_str = f\"[{','.join([f'[{p[0]},{p[1]}]' for p in all_results])}]\"\n    print(output_str)\n\ndef estimate_weibull_parameters(times, counts_data):\n    \"\"\"\n    Estimates Weibull parameters delta and p for a single dataset.\n    \n    This function implements a robust two-step estimation procedure:\n    1.
