Assume catalytic turnover follows the steady-state Michaelis–Menten scheme and that the inhibitor acts by classical competitive inhibition at the active site serine, with an equilibrium inhibition constant $K_i$. In the absence of inhibitor, the initial hydrolysis velocity of the antibiotic at substrate concentration $[S]$ is $v_0$, and in the presence of inhibitor at concentration $[I]$ it is $v_I$. Take the Michaelis constant $K_M$ of the beta-lactam for the enzyme to be $K_M = 50~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and the inhibitor constant to be $K_i = 10~\\mathrm{nM}$. If the antibiotic concentration equals the Michaelis constant (that is, $[S] = K_M$), determine the inhibitor concentration $[I]$ required to reduce the initial hydrolysis rate to one-tenth of its uninhibited value (that is, $v_I = 0.10\\, v_0$). Express your final numeric answer in $\\mathrm{nM}$. No rounding is required; provide the exact value as implied by the model.", "solution": "The problem at hand is a standard exercise in enzyme kinetics, which must be approached with formal rigor.\n\nThe analysis begins with the foundational Michaelis–Menten equation, which describes the initial velocity $v$ of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction as a function of substrate concentration $[S]$. In the absence of an inhibitor, this velocity, denoted as $v_0$, is given by:\n$$ v_0 = \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_M + [S]} $$\nHere, $V_{max}$ is the maximum reaction velocity and $K_M$ is the Michaelis constant.\n\nThe problem states that the inhibition mechanism is competitive. In classical competitive inhibition, the inhibitor, with concentration $[I]$, binds reversibly to the free enzyme, competing with the substrate for the active site. This does not alter $V_{max}$ but increases the apparent Michaelis constant, $K_M^{app}$, according to the relation:\n$$ K_M^{app} = K_M \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) $$\nwhere $K_i$ is the equilibrium inhibition constant.\n\nThe velocity in the presence of the inhibitor, $v_I$, is therefore described by the Michaelis–Menten form with the modified Michaelis constant:\n$$ v_I = \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_M^{app} + [S]} = \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_M \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]} $$\nThe problem provides specific conditions to determine the required inhibitor concentration $[I]$. First, the substrate concentration is set equal to the Michaelis constant:\n$$ [S] = K_M $$\nUnder this condition, the uninhibited velocity $v_0$ simplifies to:\n$$ v_0 = \\frac{V_{max} K_M}{K_M + K_M} = \\frac{V_{max} K_M}{2 K_M} = \\frac{V_{max}}{2} $$\nThis is a standard result: at $[S] = K_M$, the reaction proceeds at half its maximum velocity.\n\nSimilarly, we substitute $[S] = K_M$ into the equation for the inhibited velocity $v_I$:\n$$ v_I = \\frac{V_{max} K_M}{K_M \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + K_M} $$\nThe term $K_M$ can be factored out from the denominator and cancelled:\n$$ v_I = \\frac{V_{max} K_M}{K_M \\left[\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + 1\\right]} = \\frac{V_{max}}{2 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}} $$\nThe second condition provided is that the inhibited velocity is one-tenth of the uninhibited velocity:\n$$ v_I = 0.10 \\times v_0 $$\nSubstituting the expressions derived for $v_0$ and $v_I$:\n$$ \\frac{V_{max}}{2 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}} = 0.10 \\times \\left(\\frac{V_{max}}{2}\\right) $$\nThe term $V_{max}$, representing the maximal velocity which depends on total enzyme concentration, is present on both sides of the equation and can be cancelled, as it must be non-zero for any reaction to occur. This cancellation is expected, as the problem concerns the relative reduction in rate, not the absolute rate.\n$$ \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}} = \\frac{0.10}{2} = 0.05 $$\nWe now solve this algebraic equation for the unknown concentration $[I]$. Taking the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$ 2 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i} = \\frac{1}{0.05} $$\nThe value of the right-hand side is $\\frac{1}{0.05} = \\frac{1}{5/100} = \\frac{100}{5} = 20$.\n$$ 2 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i} = 20 $$\nSubtracting $2$ from both sides gives:\n$$ \\frac{[I]}{K_i} = 18 $$\nThus, the required inhibitor concentration is directly proportional to its inhibition constant:\n$$ [I] = 18 \\times K_i $$\nThis result demonstrates that to achieve the specified $90\\%$ reduction in velocity under the condition $[S]=K_M$, the inhibitor concentration must be $18$ times its $K_i$ value. Notice that the numerical value of $K_M$ was not required for this derivation, as its influence is entirely captured by the condition $[S]=K_M$.\n\nThe problem provides the value for the inhibition constant as $K_i = 10~\\mathrm{nM}$. Substituting this value:\n$$ [I] = 18 \\times 10~\\mathrm{nM} = 180~\\mathrm{nM} $$\nThe question requires the final answer to be expressed in units of $\\mathrm{nM}$. Therefore, the numerical value is $180$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{180}$$", "id": "2469354"}, {"introduction": "When combining antimicrobial agents, it is crucial to determine whether their joint effect is greater than the sum of their parts—a phenomenon known as synergy.
