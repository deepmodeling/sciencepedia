It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and logically consistent. A solution will be derived from the stated first principles.\n\n**Derivation of the Conjugation Rate $\\beta$**\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for $\\beta$, the instantaneous rate of successful conjugation events per unit volume. This rate is defined as the expected number of such events per unit volume, per unit time. We proceed from the foundational principles provided.\n\nLet $\\Delta N_{\\text{contacts}}$ be the expected number of contacts between donor and recipient cells, per unit volume, that occur during an infinitesimal time interval $\\mathrm{d}t$. According to the problem statement, this is given by the mass-action principle:\n$$\n\\Delta N_{\\text{contacts}} = c D R \\,\\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nHere, $c$ is the contact rate parameter, and $D$ and $R$ are the densities of the donor and recipient populations, respectively.\n\nEach of these contact events represents an opportunity for gene transfer. The problem states that each contact leads to a successful plasmid transfer with a constant, independent probability $p_t$.\n\nLet $\\Delta N_{\\text{success}}$ be the expected number of successful transfer events per unit volume during the same time interval $\\mathrm{d}t$. Since each of the $\\Delta N_{\\text{contacts}}$ events is an independent Bernoulli trial with a success probability of $p_t$, the expected number of successes is the product of the number of trials and the probability of success per trial.\n$$\n\\Delta N_{\\text{success}} = (\\text{Number of trials}) \\times (\\text{Probability of success per trial})\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for our context:\n$$\n\\Delta N_{\\text{success}} = (\\Delta N_{\\text{contacts}}) \\times p_t\n$$\nPlugging in the expression for $\\Delta N_{\\text{contacts}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta N_{\\text{success}} = (c D R \\,\\mathrm{d}t) \\times p_t\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we have:\n$$\n\\Delta N_{\\text{success}} = c p_t D R \\,\\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nThis expression gives the expected number of successful conjugation events per unit volume that occur over the time interval $\\mathrm{d}t$.\n\nThe problem defines $\\beta$ as the instantaneous *rate* of these events. A rate is a quantity per unit time. Therefore, to find the rate, we must divide the number of events, $\\Delta N_{\\text{success}}$, by the duration of the time interval, $\\mathrm{d}t$.\n$$\n\\text{Average rate over } \\mathrm{d}t = \\frac{\\Delta N_{\\text{success}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{c p_t D R \\,\\mathrm{d}t}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta N_{\\text{success}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = c p_t D R\n$$\nTo find the instantaneous rate $\\beta$, we must take the limit as the time interval $\\mathrm{d}t$ approaches zero, as specified by the definition of $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\beta = \\lim_{\\mathrm{d}t \\to 0} \\frac{\\Delta N_{\\text{success}}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n$$\nSince the expression $c p_t D R$ has no dependence on $\\mathrm{d}t$, the limit is simply the expression itself.\n$$\n\\beta = c p_t D R\n$$\nThis result is the well-known second-order kinetic rate law for conjugation, derived here directly from the specified microscopic principles of contact and transfer probability. The units are consistent: if $c$ has units of volume $\\cdot$ time$^{-1}$, $D$ and $R$ have units of cells $\\cdot$ volume$^{-1}$, and $p_t$ is dimensionless, then $\\beta$ has units of (volume $\\cdot$ time$^{-1}$) $\\cdot$ (cells $\\cdot$ volume$^{-1}$) $\\cdot$ (cells $\\cdot$ volume$^{-1}$) = cells $\\cdot$ volume$^{-1} \\cdot$ time$^{-1}$, which are events per unit volume per unit time, as required. The problem specified units of $c$ such that $c D R$ has units of events per unit volume per unit time, which directly leads to $\\beta$ having the same units, as $p_t$ is dimensionless. The logic is sound.\n\nThe final expression for the instantaneous conjugation event rate per unit volume is the product of the contact rate parameter, the probability of transfer per contact, and the densities of the donor and recipient populations.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{c p_t D R}\n$$", "id": "2500469"}, {"introduction": "With a rate law for conjugation established, we can ask a critical ecological question: under what conditions can a new resistance plasmid successfully invade a bacterial population?

A conjugative plasmid enters this population. Let the plasmid-free population density at the plasmid-free steady state be $F^{\\ast}$ (cells per milliliter). Assume:\n\n- Mass-action conjugation converts plasmid-free ($F$) to plasmid-bearing ($P$) cells at rate $\\beta F P$, where $\\beta$ has units $\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{cell}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n- The chemostat dilution rate is $D$ (per hour). At the plasmid-free steady state, the per-capita growth rate of plasmid-free cells equals the dilution rate, so the net growth of plasmid-free cells is zero.\n- Plasmid carriage imposes a multiplicative cost $c$ (dimensionless) that reduces the carrier’s per-capita growth from the plasmid-free rate to $(1-c)$ times that rate.\n- Plasmids are lost by segregational loss at rate $\\sigma$ (per hour), converting $P \\to F$.\n- There is no antibiotic present and no plasmid-encoded toxin-antitoxin; thus, plasmid loss does not increase death beyond dilution.\n\nDefine the basic reproduction number $R_0$ for the plasmid as the expected number of newly plasmid-bearing cells produced by a single plasmid-bearing cell introduced into the plasmid-free steady state, over the lifetime of that plasmid-bearing cell, when $P$ is rare and $F \\approx F^{\\ast}$. Starting only from the mass-action kinetics above, the steady-state property of the chemostat, and the definition of $R_0$ as the ratio of the rate of production of new plasmid-bearing cells to the total rate of loss of plasmid-bearing state, derive a closed-form expression for $R_0$ in terms of $F^{\\ast}$, $\\beta$, $\\sigma$, $c$, and $D$.

It presents a standard model in microbial population genetics and provides all necessary parameters and definitions for a rigorous solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe task is to derive and calculate the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, for a conjugative plasmid in a chemostat. $R_0$ is defined as the expected number of new plasmid-bearing cells produced by a single plasmid-bearing cell introduced into a plasmid-free steady-state population. This can be expressed as the ratio of the rate of production of new plasmid-bearing cells to the total rate of loss of the plasmid-bearing state, evaluated at the plasmid-free equilibrium.\n\nLet $F$ and $P$ denote the population densities (in cells per milliliter) of plasmid-free and plasmid-bearing cells, respectively. The plasmid-free steady-state density is given as $F^{\\ast}$. The problem asks for the derivation of $R_0$ when a small number of plasmid-bearing cells are introduced, i.e., when $P \\to 0$ and $F \\approx F^{\\ast}$.\n\nWe analyze the rates of gain and loss for the plasmid-bearing population, $P$, to construct $R_0$. The structure of $R_0$ is determined by the principles of the Next-Generation Matrix (NGM) method, where $R_0$ is the leading eigenvalue of the matrix product $\\mathcal{F}\\mathcal{V}^{-1}$. For a single \"infected\" class ($P$), this simplifies to the scalar ratio of the new infection rate to the net loss rate.\n\n1.  **Rate of Production of New Plasmid-Bearing Cells (The \"New Infection\" Term):**\n    New plasmid-bearing cells are generated exclusively through conjugation, where a plasmid-free cell is converted into a plasmid-bearing one. The problem states this occurs via a mass-action process at a total rate of $\\beta F P$. When considering a single plasmid-bearing cell ($P=1$) in a population of susceptible cells at density $F^{\\ast}$, the rate at which this single cell generates new plasmid-bearing cells is $\\beta F^{\\ast} \\times 1 = \\beta F^{\\ast}$. This term, with units of $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, represents the per-capita rate of new \"infections\" and constitutes the numerator of the $R_0$ expression.\n\n2.  **Total Rate of Loss of the Plasmid-Bearing State (The \"Net Loss\" Term):**\n    The plasmid-bearing state is lost from the population through several processes. We must determine the net per-capita rate of loss for the lineage of a single plasmid-bearing cell.\n    The dynamics of the plasmid-bearing population, $P$, in the absence of new infections from conjugation, are governed by growth, dilution, and segregational loss. The per-capita growth rate of plasmid-free cells at the plasmid-free steady state is equal to the dilution rate, $D$. The plasmid imposes a fitness cost, $c$, reducing the per-capita growth rate of plasmid-bearing cells to $g_P = (1-c)D$.\n    The net rate of change of the plasmid-bearing population, excluding new conjugation events, is given by:\n    $$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = (\\text{growth})P - (\\text{dilution})P - (\\text{segregation})P $$\n    $$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = g_P P - D P - \\sigma P $$\n    Substituting $g_P = (1-c)D$:\n    $$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = (1-c)D P - D P - \\sigma P = (D - cD - D - \\sigma)P = -(cD + \\sigma)P $$\n    This equation shows that, in the absence of new transmission, the plasmid-bearing lineage declines exponentially. The quantity $(cD + \\sigma)$ is the net per-capita rate of loss of the plasmid-bearing state. This net loss arises from two distinct effects:\n    - The effective loss due to competitive disadvantage, $cD$. This is the rate at which the plasmid-bearing lineage is outcompeted by the faster-growing plasmid-free population.\n    - The direct loss due to plasmid instability (segregation), $\\sigma$.\n    This net loss rate, $cD + \\sigma$, with units of $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, represents the denominator of the $R_0$ expression. It is the inverse of the expected lifetime of the plasmid-bearing lineage.\n\n3.  **Derivation of $R_0$:**\n    Combining these terms, $R_0$ is the ratio of the rate of production to the rate of loss:\n    $$ R_0 = \\frac{\\text{Rate of new plasmid acquisition per P cell}}{\\text{Net rate of loss of the P state per P cell}} $$\n    $$ R_0 = \\frac{\\beta F^{\\ast}}{cD + \\sigma} $$\n    This is the closed-form expression for the basic reproduction number of the plasmid.\n\n4.  **Numerical Evaluation:**\n    We are given the following parameter values:\n    - $F^{\\ast} = 8.0 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{cells}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$\n    - $\\beta = 1.4 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{cell}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n    - $\\sigma = 1.7 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n    - $c = 0.035$\n    - $D = 0.23\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n\n    We substitute these values into the derived expression for $R_0$. All units are consistent, resulting in a dimensionless value for $R_0$.\n\n    First, we calculate the numerator, the rate of new plasmid acquisition:\n    $$ \\beta F^{\\ast} = (1.4 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (8.0 \\times 10^{8}) = 11.2 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.0112\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} $$\n\n    Next, we calculate the denominator, the net rate of loss:\n    $$ cD + \\sigma = (0.035) \\times (0.23) + (1.7 \\times 10^{-3}) $$\n    $$ cD = 0.00805\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} $$\n    $$ cD + \\sigma = 0.00805 + 0.0017 = 0.00975\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} $$\n\n    Finally, we compute the ratio to find $R_0$:\n    $$ R_0 = \\frac{0.0112}{0.00975} \\approx 1.1487179... $$\n\n    Rounding the result to $3$ significant figures as requested, we obtain:\n    $$ R_0 \\approx 1.15 $$\n    Since $R_0 > 1$, the plasmid is predicted to successfully invade and persist in the bacterial population under these conditions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.15}\n$$", "id": "2500455"}, {"introduction": "If a plasmid's $R_0$ is greater than one, it is expected to invade.

Analysis of equilibria.\n\nFirst, we derive the equation for the total population density $N(t)$. By definition, $\\frac{dN}{dt} = \\frac{dD}{dt} + \\frac{dR}{dt} + \\frac{dT}{dt}$. Summing the three ODEs:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = \\mu_{D} D \\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right) + \\mu_{R} R \\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right) - \\beta D R + \\mu_{T} T \\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right) + \\beta D R $$\nThe conjugation terms cancel, yielding:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = \\left(\\mu_{D} D(t) + \\mu_{R} R(t) + \\mu_{T} T(t)\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{N(t)}{K}\\right) $$\nThis can be written as $\\frac{dN}{dt} = \\bar{\\mu}(t) N(t) (1 - \\frac{N(t)}{K})$, where $\\bar{\\mu}(t) = \\frac{\\mu_{D} D(t) + \\mu_{R} R(t) + \\mu_{T} T(t)}{N(t)}$ is the population-averaged intrinsic growth rate.\n\nEquilibrium points $(\\hat{D}, \\hat{R}, \\hat{T})$ are found by setting all time derivatives to zero: $\\frac{dD}{dt}=0$, $\\frac{dR}{dt}=0$, $\\frac{dT}{dt}=0$.\nFrom the equation for $\\frac{dN}{dt} = 0$, we find that any equilibrium must satisfy either $\\hat{N} = 0$ (implying $\\hat{D}=\\hat{R}=\\hat{T}=0$) or $\\hat{N} = K$ (assuming $\\bar{\\mu} \\ne 0$).\n\nCase I: Trivial equilibrium.\n$(\\hat{D}, \\hat{R}, \\hat{T}) = (0, 0, 0)$. This corresponds to the extinction of the entire population.\n\nCase II: Non-trivial equilibria at carrying capacity.\nIf the population is at equilibrium, $\\hat{N} = \\hat{D}+\\hat{R}+\\hat{T} = K$, the logistic growth term $(1 - \\frac{N}{K})$ becomes zero.\nThe system of equations at equilibrium becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dD}{dt} = \\mu_{D} \\hat{D} \\left(1 - \\frac{K}{K}\\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = \\mu_{R} \\hat{R} \\left(1 - \\frac{K}{K}\\right) - \\beta \\hat{D} \\hat{R} = -\\beta \\hat{D} \\hat{R} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dt} = \\mu_{T} \\hat{T} \\left(1 - \\frac{K}{K}\\right) + \\beta \\hat{D} \\hat{R} = \\beta \\hat{D} \\hat{R} = 0 $$\nThe first equation is satisfied for any $\\hat{D}$. The second and third equations impose the critical constraint $\\beta \\hat{D} \\hat{R} = 0$. Since $\\beta > 0$ by definition, this implies that at any non-trivial equilibrium, either $\\hat{D} = 0$ or $\\hat{R} = 0$.\n\nThis result demonstrates that a coexistence equilibrium state where $\\hat{D} > 0$, $\\hat{R} > 0$, and $\\hat{T} > 0$ is impossible in this model. The reason is structural: for the donor population to be in equilibrium with $\\hat{D} > 0$, the total population must be at the carrying capacity, $\\hat{N}=K$. At this total density, the growth terms for all subpopulations vanish, and the dynamics are governed solely by the conjugation term $\\beta D R$. For the recipient and transconjugant populations to also be in equilibrium, this conjugation flux must be zero, which requires either donors or recipients to be absent.\n\nThe possible coexistence states are therefore limited to pairs of populations:\n- If $\\hat{D} = 0$, the plasmid is absent. The system reduces to competition between $R$ and $T$, with $\\hat{R}+\\hat{T}=K$. Competitive exclusion dictates that only the population with the higher growth rate survives. $(\\hat{D}, \\hat{R}, \\hat{T}) = (0, K, 0)$ if $\\mu_{R} > \\mu_{T}$, or $(0,0,K)$ if $\\mu_{T} > \\mu_{R}$. A line of coexistence equilibria with $\\hat{R}+\\hat{T}=K$ exists only in the non-generic case where $\\mu_{R} = \\mu_{T}$.\n- If $\\hat{R} = 0$, recipients are absent. The system reduces to competition between $D$ and $T$, with $\\hat{D}+\\hat{T}=K$. Again, competitive exclusion applies. $(\\hat{D}, \\hat{R}, \\hat{T}) = (K, 0, 0)$ if $\\mu_{D} > \\mu_{T}$, or $(0,0,K)$ if $\\mu_{T} > \\mu_{D}$. Coexistence is possible only if $\\mu_{D} = \\mu_{T}$.\n\nIn summary, a three-species coexistence is impossible. Two-species coexistence is only possible under the specific condition that their intrinsic growth rates are identical.\n\n3. Calculation of the recipient halving time $\\tau$.\n\nIn the specified late-stage regime, we are given the following conditions:\n- The total population is at carrying capacity: $N(t) \\approx K$. This implies the density-dependent growth term is negligible: $(1 - \\frac{N(t)}{K}) \\approx 0$.\n- Donor density is constant: $D(t) \\approx D_{\\ast} = 2.5 \\times 10^{8}$ cells/mL.\n- The transfer rate constant is $\\beta = 3.2 \\times 10^{-10}$ mL/(cell$\\cdot$hr).\n\nApplying these approximations to the ODE for recipients:\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = \\mu_{R} R(t) \\underbrace{\\left(1 - \\frac{N(t)}{K}\\right)}_{\\approx 0} - \\beta D(t) R(t) \\approx - \\beta D_{\\ast} R(t) $$\nThis simplifies to the first-order linear ODE for exponential decay:\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = -(\\beta D_{\\ast}) R(t) $$\nWe solve this equation by separation of variables, integrating from $t=0$ to $t=\\tau$:\n$$ \\int_{R(0)}^{R(\\tau)} \\frac{dR}{R} = - \\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\beta D_{\\ast} dt $$\n$$ \\ln(R(\\tau)) - \\ln(R(0)) = - \\beta D_{\\ast} \\tau $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{R(\\tau)}{R(0)}\\right) = - \\beta D_{\\ast} \\tau $$\nWe are asked to find the time $\\tau$ at which the recipient density is halved, i.e., $R(\\tau) = \\frac{R(0)}{2}$.\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = - \\ln(2) = - \\beta D_{\\ast} \\tau $$\nSolving for $\\tau$ gives the exact analytical expression for the halving time:\n$$ \\tau = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\beta D_{\\ast}} $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$$ \\beta = 3.2 \\times 10^{-10} \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{cell} \\cdot \\text{hr}} $$\n$$ D_{\\ast} = 2.5 \\times 10^{8} \\frac{\\text{cells}}{\\text{mL}} $$\nThe product, which is the decay rate constant, is:\n$$ \\beta D_{\\ast} = (3.2 \\times 10^{-10}) \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{8}) \\text{hr}^{-1} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\text{hr}^{-1} = 0.08 \\text{hr}^{-1} $$\nFinally, we compute $\\tau$:\n$$ \\tau = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.08} \\approx \\frac{0.69314718}{0.08} \\approx 8.66433975 \\text{ hours} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we obtain the final numerical answer.\n$$ \\tau \\approx 8.664 \\text{ hours} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8.664}$$", "id": "2500537"}]}
