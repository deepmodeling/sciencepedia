Consider an AMP of length $20$ amino acids with the following ionizable groups and counts: $n_{\\mathrm{Lys}}=5$ lysine side chains, $n_{\\mathrm{Arg}}=3$ arginine side chains, $n_{\\mathrm{His}}=4$ histidine side chains, a free $N$-terminus, and a free $C$-terminus.

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information and constraints for a unique solution. It is therefore deemed valid and will be solved as stated.\n\nThe average net charge $Q$ of a polypeptide is the sum of the average charges of all its ionizable groups. For a given ionizable group, its average charge depends on the solution $\\mathrm{pH}$ and its intrinsic acidity constant, $\\mathrm{p}K_a$. The relationship is described by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nThe ionizable groups in the peptide are the C-terminus, which is an acidic group (type $HA \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + A^-$), and the N-terminus and the side chains of lysine, arginine, and histidine, which are basic groups (their conjugate acids are of the type $BH^+ \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + B$).\n\nFor an acidic group, the average charge $q_{\\text{acidic}}$ is given by the fraction of the molecule in its deprotonated (negatively charged) state, multiplied by its charge, $-1$. The fraction deprotonated, $\\alpha_{A^-}$, is given by:\n$$\n\\alpha_{A^-} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{p}K_a - \\mathrm{pH}}}\n$$\nThus, the average charge of a single acidic group is:\n$$\nq_{\\text{acidic}} = -1 \\cdot \\alpha_{A^-} = \\frac{-1}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{p}K_a - \\mathrm{pH}}}\n$$\n\nFor a basic group, the average charge $q_{\\text{basic}}$ is given by the fraction of the molecule in its protonated (positively charged) state, multiplied by its charge, $+1$.

This large increase in positive charge is primarily due to the protonation state of the $4$ histidine residues ($\\mathrm{p}K_a=6.0$), which are mostly neutral at $\\mathrm{pH}=7.4$ but become mostly positively charged at $\\mathrm{pH}=5.0$. The primary mechanism of action for cationic AMPs against Gram-negative bacteria is electrostatic attraction to the negatively charged outer membrane, which is rich in lipopolysaccharides (LPS). A higher net positive charge on the AMP results in a stronger electrostatic binding affinity for the bacterial surface. This enhanced accumulation at the membrane is the critical first step that facilitates subsequent membrane disruption and cell death. Therefore, the AMP's antimicrobial activity is expected to **increase** as the environment shifts from the physiological $\\mathrm{pH}$ of $7.4$ to the acidic $\\mathrm{pH}$ of $5.0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.725}\n$$", "id": "2473004"}, {"introduction": "Bacteria have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to resist the action of cationic AMPs, often by altering their own surface charge to create electrostatic repulsion.

The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) is defined as the lowest concentration that prevents visible growth after standardized incubation. Two known charge-modifying systems are considered as foundational facts: (i) Multiple peptide resistance factor (MprF) catalyzes lysinylation of phosphatidylglycerol and flips lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol to the outer leaflet, introducing positive charge into the cytoplasmic membrane; (ii) the D-alanylation (Dlt) operon adds D-alanine to wall teichoic acids, masking negatively charged phosphate groups in the cell wall. Electrostatic attraction between cationic AMPs and anionic bacterial surfaces increases AMP accumulation at the membrane; conversely, increased positive surface character repels cationic AMPs. Zeta potential is a physicochemical measure of effective surface charge at the slipping plane; more negative zeta potential indicates a more net negatively charged surface.\n\nYou measure MICs of LL-37 in cation-adjusted Mueller–Hinton broth at $\\mathrm{pH}=7.4$ for four strains: wild type (WT), $\\Delta mprF$, $\\Delta dltABCD$, and $\\Delta mprF\\,\\Delta dltABCD$.

Dlt-mediated D-alanylation is the dominant resistance mechanism; deleting $dltABCD$ should make the surface less negative (zeta potential more positive), thereby lowering the LL-37 MIC; the more modest effect of $\\Delta mprF$ reflects compensation; the double mutant is not expected to be more susceptible than the dominant single mutant.\n\nC. MprF-mediated lysinylation is the dominant resistance mechanism; however, deleting $mprF$ makes the surface less negative (zeta potential more positive) due to phosphatidylglycerol accumulation, which lowers the LL-37 MIC; the double mutant’s effect is non-additive, implying both systems are in the same linear pathway.\n\nD. Neither charge-modifying system is dominant; the LL-37 MIC differences are best explained by altered growth rates or efflux; zeta potential is expected to be unchanged by either deletion; the chloramphenicol data support a non-charge-based mechanism.", "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific and logical integrity.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Organism**: Gram-positive pathogen.\n- **Agent**: Cationic Antimicrobial Peptide (AMP), human cathelicidin LL-37.\n- **Strains**: Wild type (WT), $\\Delta mprF$, $\\Delta dltABCD$, and $\\Delta mprF\\Delta dltABCD$.\n- **Definition of MIC**: Minimum Inhibitory Concentration, the lowest concentration preventing visible growth.\n- **Mechanism (i) MprF**: \"Multiple peptide resistance factor (MprF) catalyzes lysinylation of phosphatidylglycerol and flips lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol to the outer leaflet, introducing positive charge into the cytoplasmic membrane\".\n- **Mechanism (ii) Dlt operon**: \"the D-alanylation (Dlt) operon adds D-alanine to wall teichoic acids, masking negatively charged phosphate groups in the cell wall\".

Chloramphenicol is a \"neutral, hydrophobic small-molecule antibiotic\".\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, describing well-established mechanisms of bacterial resistance to AMPs (MprF- and Dlt-mediated charge modification). It is well-posed, providing sufficient data and clear definitions to deduce a logical answer. The information is self-contained and internally consistent. The experimental design, including a control antibiotic (chloramphenicol), is sound and allows for specific conclusions about charge-mediated effects. The provided numerical data are biologically plausible. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of fundamental principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution can be derived from the provided information.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe analysis must proceed from the provided facts and data only.\n\n1.  **Interpretation of the Control Experiment**: The MIC of chloramphenicol, a neutral antibiotic, is constant at $2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$ across all four strains. This is a critical control. It demonstrates that the deletion of $mprF$, $dltABCD$, or both does not cause a general fitness defect, alter broad membrane permeability, or affect efflux pump activity in a way that non-specifically changes antibiotic susceptibility. Therefore, any observed differences in susceptibility to the cationic AMP LL-37 must be attributed to the specific functions of the deleted genes, namely, the modification of cell envelope charge.\n\n2.  **Analysis of LL-37 Susceptibility Data**: The problem establishes that both MprF and the Dlt system contribute to a more positive cell surface, which confers resistance to cationic AMPs via electrostatic repulsion. A lower MIC indicates higher susceptibility, which corresponds to a less positive (or more negative) cell surface.\n    - The WT strain, with both systems functional, has the highest MIC ($16\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$), indicating it is the most resistant.\n    - Deletion of the $dltABCD$ operon ($\\Delta dltABCD$) results in an MIC of $8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$. This is a $2$-fold decrease in MIC ($16/8 = 2$), signifying a modest increase in susceptibility.\n    - Deletion of the $mprF$ gene ($\\Delta mprF$) results in an MIC of $2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$. This is an $8$-fold decrease in MIC ($16/2 = 8$), signifying a substantial increase in susceptibility.\n\n3.  **Identification of the Dominant Mechanism**: The magnitude of the effect of gene deletion on MIC directly reflects the relative contribution of that gene product to resistance. Since the deletion of $mprF$ causes a significantly larger decrease in MIC (an $8$-fold drop) compared to the deletion of $dltABCD$ (a $2$-fold drop), the MprF system is demonstrably the **dominant** resistance mechanism in this specific pathogen background under the tested conditions.\n\n4.  **Prediction of Zeta Potential Change**: The MprF system introduces positive charge to the membrane. Therefore, deleting the $mprF$ gene removes a primary source of positive surface charge. This makes the net charge of the bacterial envelope more negative. According to the problem's definition, \"more negative zeta potential indicates a more net negatively charged surface\". Thus, the deletion of the dominant locus, $mprF$, will cause the zeta potential to shift to a **more negative** value.\n\n5.  **Interpretation of the Double Deletion Mutant**: The double mutant, $\\Delta mprF\\,\\Delta dltABCD$, exhibits an MIC of $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$. This is the lowest MIC observed, indicating the highest level of susceptibility. This susceptibility is greater than that of either single mutant ($\\text{MIC} = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$ for the double mutant, versus $2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$ for $\\Delta mprF$ and $8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$ for $\\Delta dltABCD$). The fact that the double deletion results in a phenotype more severe than the most affected single deletion ($\\Delta mprF$) means that the Dlt system still provides a residual level of resistance even in the absence of MprF. This indicates the two systems operate at least partially independently and their contributions to resistance are **additive** (or possibly synergistic). They are not in a simple linear pathway, as that would likely result in an epistatic interaction where the double mutant's phenotype would match that of one of the single mutants.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. MprF-mediated lysinylation is the dominant resistance mechanism; deleting $mprF$ removes a major source of positive surface character, making the net surface charge more negative (zeta potential shifts to a more negative value), thereby lowering the LL-37 MIC; the $\\Delta mprF\\,\\Delta dltABCD$ MIC is lower still because both charge-repelling modifications are absent, consistent with additive contributions.**\n- **Dominant mechanism**: Correct. As derived above, the $8$-fold MIC reduction for $\\Delta mprF$ is larger than the $2$-fold reduction for $\\Delta dltABCD$.\n- **Zeta potential change**: Correct. Deleting $mprF$ removes positive charge, making the surface more negative, which corresponds to a more negative zeta potential.\n- **MIC interpretation**: Correct. A more negative surface increases attraction to cationic LL-37, increasing its local concentration and thus lowering the MIC.\n- **Double-deletion interpretation**: Correct. The MIC of the double mutant ($1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$) is lower than the MIC of the $\\Delta mprF$ single mutant ($2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$), indicating that removing the Dlt system has an additional sensitizing effect. This is consistent with additive contributions.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Dlt-mediated D-alanylation is the dominant resistance mechanism; deleting $dltABCD$ should make the surface less negative (zeta potential more positive), thereby lowering the LL-37 MIC; the more modest effect of $\\Delta mprF$ reflects compensation; the double mutant is not expected to be more susceptible than the dominant single mutant.**\n- **Dominant mechanism**: Incorrect. The data clearly show MprF is dominant.\n- **Zeta potential change**: Incorrect. Deleting a system that masks negative charges (Dlt) should make the surface *more* negative, not less negative (more positive).\n- **Double-mutant interpretation**: Incorrect. The data show the double mutant is more susceptible than any single mutant.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. MprF-mediated lysinylation is the dominant resistance mechanism; however, deleting $mprF$ makes the surface less negative (zeta potential more positive) due to phosphatidylglycerol accumulation, which lowers the LL-37 MIC; the double mutant’s effect is non-additive, implying both systems are in the same linear pathway.**\n- **Dominant mechanism**: Correct.\n- **Zeta potential change**: Incorrect. This statement contradicts the stated function of MprF. MprF adds a positive lysine. Removing this function makes the surface more negative. The speculation about phosphatidylglycerol accumulation is both unfounded by the problem text and biochemically mis-interpreted; anionic phosphatidylglycerol would make the surface more negative, not more positive.\n- **Double-mutant interpretation**: Incorrect. The observed phenotype, where the double mutant is more susceptible than either single mutant, is the opposite of what would be expected for a simple linear pathway (epistasis). It suggests additivity or synergy.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Neither charge-modifying system is dominant; the LL-37 MIC differences are best explained by altered growth rates or efflux; zeta potential is expected to be unchanged by either deletion; the chloramphenicol data support a non-charge-based mechanism.**\n- **Dominance**: Incorrect. The data show a clear dominance of MprF.\n- **Explanation of MIC differences**: Incorrect. The chloramphenicol control experiment explicitly rules out non-specific mechanisms like altered growth rates or efflux.\n- **Zeta potential change**: Incorrect. The fundamental premise is that these systems alter charge; deleting them must alter zeta potential.\n- **Interpretation of chloramphenicol data**: Incorrect. The control data support a charge-based mechanism for LL-37 by eliminating alternative explanations.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis of the provided information, Option A is the only statement that is fully consistent with all data and principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2472944"}, {"introduction": "A critical challenge in developing any antimicrobial agent is the inevitable evolution of resistance, and AMPs are no exception.

By deriving and implementing a model for monotherapy versus combination therapy, you will explore a powerful quantitative framework for designing more robust, resistance-proof treatments [@problem_id:2472996].", "problem": "You are to write a complete, runnable program that computes the expected time to emergence of an established resistant lineage under antimicrobial therapy for antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), using a stochastic birth–death framework grounded in first principles. You must start from the following fundamental bases only and derive any further expressions yourself: (i) definitions and standard properties of linear birth–death branching processes, (ii) the notion that resistant lineages must both appear and successfully establish to be clinically relevant, and (iii) independence of orthogonal resistance mechanisms for distinct AMPs (no cross-resistance). Do not assume any result that is not derivable from these bases.\n\nContext and definitions:\n- Consider a large, well-mixed bacterial population exposed to antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Therapy options include monotherapy with one AMP or combination therapy with two orthogonal AMPs. Orthogonality means that resistance mechanisms to AMP A and AMP B are independent, and that resistance to one does not confer resistance to the other.\n- Model the appearance and fate of resistant lineages using a linear birth–death branching process. Let $b$ denote the per capita birth rate (per hour) and $d$ the per capita death rate (per hour) of a lineage under the relevant drug environment.\n- A lineage with $b > d$ is supercritical and has a nonzero probability of surviving indefinitely (establishing). A lineage with $b \\le d$ is subcritical or critical and will almost surely go extinct; however, it may still produce a finite lineage over which additional mutations can occur before extinction.\n- Let $N_S$ denote the number of susceptible cells maintained approximately constant by the environment during the time window considered, and let $b_S$ denote the per capita birth rate (per hour) of susceptible cells. Let $\\mu_X$ denote the per-division mutation probability to resistance state $X$.\n- The expected time to the first established resistant lineage can be computed by modeling the occurrence of successful establishment events as a Poisson process with a constant hazard rate $\\Lambda$ (per hour). If $\\Lambda > 0$, the expected time is $1/\\Lambda$ hours. If $\\Lambda = 0$, the expected time is infinite.\n\nTherapy models to consider:\n- Monotherapy with AMP $X \\in \\{\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{B}\\}$: Susceptible cells divide at rate $b_S$ from a constant pool $N_S$. Each division generates a resistant mutant to AMP $X$ with probability $\\mu_X$. A resistant mutant to AMP $X$ has per capita birth rate $b_{R_X}$ and death rate $d_{R_X}$ in the presence of AMP $X$.\n- Combination therapy with orthogonal AMPs A and B: Single-resistant mutants (resistant to only AMP A or only AMP B) are suppressed by the other AMP, so they have per capita rates $(b_A, d_A)$ and $(b_B, d_B)$, respectively, in the combination environment. Double-resistant mutants (resistant to both AMP A and AMP B) have per capita rates $(b_{DR}, d_{DR})$ in the combination environment. Mutations occur only upon cell division with probabilities $\\mu_A$ and $\\mu_B$, and are independent. Assume the rare-mutation regime where multiple mutations within a single division are negligible unless explicitly required by your derivation.\n\nYour task:\n- Derive, from the stated bases, an expression for the expected time (in hours) to the first established resistant lineage under monotherapy and under combination therapy with orthogonal AMPs. Under monotherapy, an established lineage is one that is resistant to the administered AMP and does not go extinct. Under combination therapy, an established lineage is one that is resistant to both AMPs and does not go extinct, recognizing that single-resistant lineages are not clinically relevant unless they acquire the second resistance before extinction.\n- Your program must implement your derived expressions to compute the expected times for the test suite below.\n\nUnits and output requirements:\n- All rates $b$, $d$ are in units of per hour.\n- All expected times must be reported in hours as floating-point numbers rounded to three decimal places. If the expected time is infinite, output the string representation of positive infinity as produced by your programming language’s standard floating-point formatting (for example, in Python, this is $\\text{\"inf\"}$).\n- Final output format: Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results for all test cases in the specified order, formatted as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example, $[\\text{result}_1,\\text{result}_2,\\text{result}_3]$.\n\nTest suite (five cases):\n- Case $1$ (monotherapy A, finite-time “happy path”):\n  - Therapy: monotherapy with AMP A.\n  - Parameters: $N_S = 10^6$ cells, $b_S = 0.7$ per hour, $\\mu_A = 1\\times 10^{-7}$ per division, $b_{R_A} = 0.8$ per hour, $d_{R_A} = 0.6$ per hour.\n- Case $2$ (combination therapy with orthogonal AMPs, finite-time “happy path”):\n  - Therapy: combination with AMPs A and B.\n  - Parameters: $N_S = 10^6$ cells, $b_S = 0.7$ per hour, $\\mu_A = 1\\times 10^{-7}$ per division, $\\mu_B = 2\\times 10^{-7}$ per division, $b_A = 0.3$ per hour, $d_A = 0.9$ per hour, $b_B = 0.25$ per hour, $d_B = 0.85$ per hour, $b_{DR} = 0.85$ per hour, $d_{DR} = 0.65$ per hour.\n- Case $3$ (monotherapy B, boundary case with non-establishing resistance):\n  - Therapy: monotherapy with AMP B.\n  - Parameters: $N_S = 10^6$ cells, $b_S = 0.7$ per hour, $\\mu_B = 2\\times 10^{-7}$ per division, $b_{R_B} = 0.5$ per hour, $d_{R_B} = 0.6$ per hour.\n- Case $4$ (combination therapy, near-critical single-resistant lineages):\n  - Therapy: combination with AMPs A and B.\n  - Parameters: $N_S = 10^6$ cells, $b_S = 0.7$ per hour, $\\mu_A = 5\\times 10^{-8}$ per division, $\\mu_B = 5\\times 10^{-8}$ per division, $b_A = 0.49$ per hour, $d_A = 0.5$ per hour, $b_B = 0.2$ per hour, $d_B = 0.6$ per hour, $b_{DR} = 0.9$ per hour, $d_{DR} = 0.7$ per hour.\n- Case $5$ (monotherapy A, low-hazard regime):\n  - Therapy: monotherapy with AMP A.\n  - Parameters: $N_S = 10^5$ cells, $b_S = 0.5$ per hour, $\\mu_A = 1\\times 10^{-8}$ per division, $b_{R_A} = 0.9$ per hour, $d_{R_A} = 0.8$ per hour.\n\nProgramming task:\n- Implement a program that, using your derived expressions and the above inputs, computes the expected time to the first established resistant lineage for each case, in hours, rounded to three decimal places, output on a single line in the format $[\\text{result}_1,\\text{result}_2,\\text{result}_3,\\text{result}_4,\\text{result}_5]$ in the order of cases $1$ through $5$.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in mathematical biology that requires derivation from first principles, which are provided. It is free of contradictions, ambiguities, and factual errors. We shall proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe central task is to compute the expected time to the emergence of an established resistant bacterial lineage, denoted as $T_E$. This time is modeled as the reciprocal of a constant hazard rate, $\\Lambda$, representing the rate of successful establishment events per hour. Thus, $T_E = 1/\\Lambda$. If $\\Lambda=0$, the expected time is infinite. Our primary objective is to derive the expression for $\\Lambda$ under two therapeutic scenarios: monotherapy and combination therapy.\n\nThe fundamental construct for the total hazard rate is:\n$$ \\Lambda = (\\text{Rate of generation of initial mutants}) \\times P(\\text{mutant lineage leads to an established population}) $$\nThis principle will be applied to each scenario.\n\nFirst, we must state a cornerstone result from the theory of linear birth-death branching processes. For a lineage starting with a single individual, with per capita birth rate $b$ and per capita death rate $d$, the probability of the lineage surviving indefinitely (i.e., establishing) is given by:\n$$ P_{est} = \\max\\left(0, 1 - \\frac{d}{b}\\right) = \\frac{\\max(0, b - d)}{b} $$\nThis probability is non-zero only if the process is supercritical, meaning $b > d$. If $b \\le d$, the lineage goes extinct with probability $1$, and thus $P_{est} = 0$. We assume $b > 0$ for any meaningful growth process.\n\nNow we derive the hazard rates for the specified therapies.\n\nMonotherapy with Antimicrobial Peptide $X$:\nUnder monotherapy, an established lineage is one resistant to the administered AMP $X$ that becomes supercritical.\n1.  Rate of Generation of Resistant Mutants: The susceptible population of size $N_S$ divides at a total rate of $N_S b_S$ divisions per hour. Each division has a probability $\\mu_X$ of producing a mutant resistant to AMP $X$. Thus, the rate at which new resistant mutants appear is:\n    $$ R_{gen, X} = N_S b_S \\mu_X $$\n2.  Probability of Establishment: Each new mutant initiates a lineage with birth rate $b_{R_X}$ and death rate $d_{R_X}$. The probability of this single lineage establishing is:\n    $$ P_{est, R_X} = \\frac{\\max(0, b_{R_X} - d_{R_X})}{b_{R_X}} $$\n3.  Total Hazard Rate, $\\Lambda_{mono, X}$: The total hazard rate is the product of the generation rate and the establishment probability.\n    $$ \\Lambda_{mono, X} = R_{gen, X} \\cdot P_{est, R_X} = N_S b_S \\mu_X \\frac{\\max(0, b_{R_X} - d_{R_X})}{b_{R_X}} $$\nThe expected time to establishment is $T_{E, mono, X} = 1/\\Lambda_{mono, X}$. If $b_{R_X} \\le d_{R_X}$, then $\\Lambda_{mono, X} = 0$ and $T_{E, mono, X} = \\infty$.\n\nCombination Therapy with Orthogonal AMPs A and B:\nUnder combination therapy, an established lineage must be resistant to both AMPs (double-resistant, DR) to survive and proliferate. Single-resistant mutants (type A or type B) are suppressed by one of the AMPs, meaning their birth-death processes are subcritical ($b  d$). These lineages are destined for extinction but can produce a DR mutant before disappearing.\nThe emergence of a DR lineage can occur via two independent, sequential pathways:\n1.  Susceptible ($S$) $\\to$ single-resistant A ($R_A$) $\\to$ double-resistant ($DR$).\n2.  Susceptible ($S$) $\\to$ single-resistant B ($R_B$) $\\to$ double-resistant ($DR$).\n\nThe total hazard rate, $\\Lambda_{combo}$, is the sum of the hazard rates of these two mutually exclusive pathways: $\\Lambda_{combo} = \\Lambda_{S \\to A \\to DR} + \\Lambda_{S \\to B \\to DR}$.\n\nLet us analyze the first pathway, $S \\to A \\to DR$:\n1.  Rate of Generation of $R_A$ Mutants: This is analogous to the monotherapy case: $R_{gen, A} = N_S b_S \\mu_A$.\n2.  Probability of an $R_A$ Lineage Producing an Established $DR$ Lineage: This is a two-step process. First, the subcritical $R_A$ lineage must produce at least one $DR$ mutant before it goes extinct. Second, that $DR$ mutant must establish.\n    -   Probability of Acquiring Second Mutation ($P_{acq, A \\to DR}$): For a subcritical birth-death process ($b_A  d_A$) starting with one individual, the expected total number of divisions before extinction is $N_{div, A} = b_A / (d_A - b_A)$. This is a known result from branching process theory. Correct.\n        Since the per-division probability of the second mutation ($\\mu_B$) is small, the probability of producing at least one DR mutant is approximately the expected number of such events:\n        $$ P_{acq, A \\to DR} \\approx N_{div, A} \\times \\mu_B = \\frac{b_A \\mu_B}{d_A - b_A} $$\n        Should the single-resistant lineage be critical ($b_A = d_A$), it is guaranteed to explore an infinite state space (in expectation), so the probability of acquiring the second mutation becomes $1$. However, the problem data implies subcritical single-resistant lineages.\n    -   Probability of $DR$ Establishment: Once a $DR$ mutant arises, it initiates a lineage with rates $(b_{DR}, d_{DR})$. Its establishment probability is:\n        $$ P_{est, DR} = \\frac{\\max(0, b_{DR} - d_{DR})}{b_{DR}} $$\n3.  Hazard Rate for Pathway $S \\to A \\to DR$:\n    $$ \\Lambda_{S \\to A \\to DR} = R_{gen, A} \\cdot P_{acq, A \\to DR} \\cdot P_{est, DR} = (N_S b_S \\mu_A) \\left(\\frac{b_A \\mu_B}{d_A - b_A}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\max(0, b_{DR} - d_{DR})}{b_{DR}}\\right) $$\n\nBy symmetry, the hazard rate for the second pathway, $S \\to B \\to DR$, is:\n$$ \\Lambda_{S \\to B \\to DR} = (N_S b_S \\mu_B) \\left(\\frac{b_B \\mu_A}{d_B - b_B}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\max(0, b_{DR} - d_{DR})}{b_{DR}}\\right) $$\n\nTotal Hazard Rate, $\\Lambda_{combo}$: Summing the rates and factoring out common terms gives:\n$$ \\Lambda_{combo} = N_S b_S \\mu_A \\mu_B \\left( \\frac{b_A}{d_A - b_A} + \\frac{b_B}{d_B - b_B} \\right) \\frac{\\max(0, b_{DR} - d_{DR})}{b_{DR}} $$\nThis formula is valid provided $d_A > b_A$ and $d_B > b_B$. The expected time is $T_{E, combo} = 1/\\Lambda_{combo}$. If $\\Lambda_{combo}=0$ (e.g., if $b_{DR} \\le d_{DR}$), then $T_{E, combo} = \\infty$.\n\nThese derived formulae are implemented to solve for the provided test cases.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef format_result(val):\n    \"\"\"Formats a floating-point result to 3 decimal places or 'inf'.\"\"\"\n    if val == float('inf'):\n        return 'inf'\n    return f\"{val:.3f}\"\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the expected time to emergence of an established resistant lineage\n    for a series of test cases based on a stochastic birth-death model.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1 (monotherapy A, finite-time “happy path”)\n        {\n            \"type\": \"mono\",\n            \"params\": {\"N_S\": 1e6, \"b_S\": 0.7, \"mu_X\": 1e-7, \"b_RX\": 0.8, \"d_RX\": 0.6}\n        },\n        # Case 2 (combination therapy with orthogonal AMPs, finite-time “happy path”)\n        {\n            \"type\": \"combo\",\n            \"params\": {\"N_S\": 1e6, \"b_S\": 0.7, \"mu_A\": 1e-7, \"mu_B\": 2e-7,\n                       \"b_A\": 0.3, \"d_A\": 0.9, \"b_B\": 0.25, \"d_B\": 0.85,\n                       \"b_DR\": 0.85, \"d_DR\": 0.65}\n        },\n        # Case 3 (monotherapy B, boundary case with non-establishing resistance)\n        {\n            \"type\": \"mono\",\n            \"params\": {\"N_S\": 1e6, \"b_S\": 0.7, \"mu_X\": 2e-7, \"b_RX\": 0.5, \"d_RX\": 0.6}\n        },\n        # Case 4 (combination therapy, near-critical single-resistant lineages)\n        {\n            \"type\": \"combo\",\n            \"params\": {\"N_S\": 1e6, \"b_S\": 0.7, \"mu_A\": 5e-8, \"mu_B\": 5e-8,\n                       \"b_A\": 0.49, \"d_A\": 0.5, \"b_B\": 0.2, \"d_B\": 0.6,\n                       \"b_DR\": 0.9, \"d_DR\": 0.7}\n        },\n        # Case 5 (monotherapy A, low-hazard regime)\n        {\n            \"type\": \"mono\",\n            \"params\": {\"N_S\": 1e5, \"b_S\": 0.5, \"mu_X\": 1e-8, \"b_RX\": 0.9, \"d_RX\": 0.8}\n        }\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        params = case[\"params\"]\n        hazard_rate = 0.0\n        \n        if case[\"type\"] == \"mono\":\n            N_S, b_S, mu_X = params[\"N_S\"], params[\"b_S\"], params[\"mu_X\"]\n            b_RX, d_RX = params[\"b_RX\"], params[\"d_RX\"]\n            \n            # The resistant lineage must be supercritical to establish.\n            if b_RX  d_RX:\n                # Probability of establishment for a single mutant lineage.\n                # P_est = (b_RX - d_RX) / b_RX\n                # Using max(0, ...) to be robust, although checked by if.\n                p_est_rx = max(0, b_RX - d_RX) / b_RX\n                \n                # Rate of generation of resistant mutants.\n                rate_gen_x = N_S * b_S * mu_X\n                \n                hazard_rate = rate_gen_x * p_est_rx\n            else:\n                hazard_rate = 0.0\n\n        elif case[\"type\"] == \"combo\":\n            N_S, b_S, mu_A, mu_B = params[\"N_S\"], params[\"b_S\"], params[\"mu_A\"], params[\"mu_B\"]\n            b_A, d_A = params[\"b_A\"], params[\"d_A\"]\n            b_B, d_B = params[\"b_B\"], params[\"d_B\"]\n            b_DR, d_DR = params[\"b_DR\"], params[\"d_DR\"]\n\n            # Double-resistant lineage must be supercritical to establish.\n            if b_DR  d_DR:\n                p_est_dr = (b_DR - d_DR) / b_DR\n                \n                # Contribution from S - A - DR pathway\n                termA = 0.0\n                if d_A  b_A and b_A  0: # Check for subcriticality and non-zero birth rate\n                    termA = b_A / (d_A - b_A)\n                \n                # Contribution from S - B - DR pathway\n                termB = 0.0\n                if d_B  b_B and b_B  0: # Check for subcriticality and non-zero birth rate\n                    termB = b_B / (d_B - b_B)\n                \n                if termA  0 or termB  0:\n                    hazard_rate = (N_S * b_S * mu_A * mu_B) * (termA + termB) * p_est_dr\n                else:\n                    hazard_rate = 0.0\n            else:\n                hazard_rate = 0.0\n\n        if hazard_rate  0:\n            expected_time = 1.0 / hazard_rate\n        else:\n            expected_time = float('inf')\n            \n        results.append(expected_time)\n\n    # Format the final output string exactly as required.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(format_result, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2472996"}]}
