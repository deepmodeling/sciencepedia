Assume the following foundational principles:\n1. Under the law of mass action for noncooperative binding, the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ of a single binding site by an antibiotic with association constant $K_{a}$ at intracellular concentration $C_{\\text{int}}$ is given by $\\theta = \\dfrac{K_{a} C_{\\text{int}}}{1 + K_{a} C_{\\text{int}}}$.\n2.

The target-binding affinity of an antibiotic lead is improved by a factor of $4$. Let the initial association constant be $K_a$ and the new association constant be $K_a'$. Then $K_a' = 4 K_a$.\n2.

The intracellular concentration at steady state is proportional to the extracellular concentration: $C_{\\text{int}} = A C_{\\text{ext}}$.\n\nThe problem is validated against the required criteria. It is scientifically grounded, using standard pharmacological models (Langmuir isotherm for binding, a simple partitioning model for accumulation). It is well-posed, providing a clear mathematical framework and asking for a quantifiable result. The provided principles are self-contained and consistent. The scenario of a trade-off between binding affinity and accumulation is a realistic problem in medicinal chemistry. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe first task is to determine how the $MIC$ scales with the association constant $K_a$ and the accumulation factor $A$. According to the definition given, the $MIC$ is the specific value of $C_{\\text{ext}}$ for which the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ reaches the threshold $\\theta^{\\ast}$. Let us denote this specific concentration as $\\text{MIC}$.\n\nAt this concentration, the intracellular concentration is $C_{\\text{int}} = A \\cdot \\text{MIC}$.\nSubstituting this into the fractional occupancy equation at the threshold condition:\n$$\n\\theta^{\\ast} = \\frac{K_a C_{\\text{int}}}{1 + K_a C_{\\text{int}}} = \\frac{K_a (A \\cdot \\text{MIC})}{1 + K_a (A \\cdot \\text{MIC})}\n$$\nWe must now solve this algebraic equation for $\\text{MIC}$.\n$$\n\\theta^{\\ast} (1 + K_a A \\cdot \\text{MIC}) = K_a A \\cdot \\text{MIC}\n$$\n$$\n\\theta^{\\ast} + \\theta^{\\ast} K_a A \\cdot \\text{MIC} = K_a A \\cdot \\text{MIC}\n$$\nRearranging the terms to isolate $\\text{MIC}$:\n$$\n\\theta^{\\ast} = K_a A \\cdot \\text{MIC} - \\theta^{\\ast} K_a A \\cdot \\text{MIC}\n$$\n$$\n\\theta^{\\ast} = (K_a A \\cdot \\text{MIC})(1 - \\theta^{\\ast})\n$$\nSolving for $\\text{MIC}$ yields:\n$$\n\\text{MIC} = \\frac{\\theta^{\\ast}}{(1 - \\theta^{\\ast})} \\frac{1}{K_a A}\n$$\nSince $\\theta^{\\ast}$ is a fixed constant threshold, the term $\\frac{\\theta^{\\ast}}{1 - \\theta^{\\ast}}$ is also a constant. Let this constant be $C = \\frac{\\theta^{\\ast}}{1 - \\theta^{\\ast}}$. The relationship is thus:\n$$\n\\text{MIC} = C \\left( \\frac{1}{K_a A} \\right)\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the $MIC$ scales inversely with the product of the association constant $K_a$ and the accumulation factor $A$. This is the required scaling relationship.\n\nThe second task is to compute the fold change in $MIC$ based on the modifications to the compound. Let the initial parameters be $K_{a,1}$ and $A_1$, and the corresponding minimum inhibitory concentration be $\\text{MIC}_1$.\n$$\n\\text{MIC}_1 = C \\left( \\frac{1}{K_{a,1} A_1} \\right)\n$$\nThe new parameters are $K_{a,2} = 4 K_{a,1}$ and $A_2 = \\frac{1}{2} A_1$.

The second part requires a direct numerical calculation based on provided data. We will address each part in sequence after validating the problem statement.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.

The relationships are based on established mass balance principles. The numerical values provided for the second part are plausible. The problem is valid and can be solved.\n\nFirst, we will derive the scaling relationship for the PK/PD index $\\frac{fAUC_{\\tau}}{MIC}$.\n\nOur derivation rests on two fundamental principles and one key assumption:\n$1$. The principle of mass balance at steady state. For a system in steady state with repeated dosing, the total amount of drug administered over one dosing interval, $\\tau$, must equal the total amount of drug eliminated from the body over that same interval.\n$2$. The definition of total plasma clearance, $CL$. Clearance is the volume of plasma cleared of drug per unit time. It relates the rate of drug elimination to the plasma drug concentration, $C(t)$, via the equation: Rate of Elimination $= CL \\cdot C(t)$. This relationship is valid for linear, first-order kinetics, which is a condition stated in the problem.\n$3$. We must make an assumption about bioavailability, which is the fraction of the administered dose that reaches systemic circulation. For simplicity and to proceed from first principles as requested, we will assume intravenous administration, which implies a bioavailability factor $F = 1$. Therefore, the entire dose $D$ enters the systemic circulation.\n\nAt steady state, the mass balance equation over one dosing interval from $t=0$ to $t=\\tau$ is:\n$$ \\text{Amount In} = \\text{Amount Out} $$\n\nThe amount of drug entering the system over one interval is the dose, $D$.\n$$ \\text{Amount In} = D $$\n\nThe amount of drug eliminated from the system is the integral of the rate of elimination over the interval $\\tau$.\n$$ \\text{Amount Out} = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} (\\text{Rate of Elimination}) \\,dt $$\nSubstituting the definition of the rate of elimination, we have:\n$$ \\text{Amount Out} = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} CL \\cdot C(t) \\,dt $$\n\nSince clearance $CL$ is stated to be constant and time-invariant, it can be moved outside the integral:\n$$ \\text{Amount Out} = CL \\int_{0}^{\\tau} C(t) \\,dt $$\n\nThe problem defines the area under the total plasma concentration–time curve over one dosing interval as $AUC_{\\tau} = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} C(t)\\,dt$.
