This exercise challenges you to apply the core principle that cleaving a circular DNA molecule at a specific number of sites yields a predictable set of linear fragments. Mastering this basic calculation is essential for designing cloning experiments, analyzing plasmid maps, and interpreting the results of gel electrophoresis [@problem_id:2529955].", "problem": "A bacterial restriction–modification (R–M) system consists of a restriction endonuclease that recognizes a specific deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence and introduces a double-strand break, and a cognate DNA methyltransferase that methylates the same sequence to protect host DNA from cleavage. The EcoRI restriction endonuclease from Escherichia coli recognizes the palindromic sequence 5′-GAATTC-3′ and cleaves unmethylated DNA at that site in vitro. Consider a covalently closed circular plasmid DNA of total length $3$ kilobase pairs (kb) that contains exactly two EcoRI recognition sites. Along the circular genetic map, the shortest arc distance between these two sites is $1$ kb, and the longer arc completes the circle. The plasmid is prepared from a strain lacking the EcoRI methyltransferase, ensuring that all EcoRI sites are unmethylated, and is then digested to completion with purified EcoRI in vitro so that every recognition site is cleaved.\n\nStarting from core definitions about restriction endonuclease recognition and cleavage of circular DNA, and the conservation of length upon cutting, derive the sizes of all linear restriction fragments produced by this complete digestion. Express your final answer as a row vector of fragment sizes in kilobase pairs (kb), ordered from smallest to largest. Do not include units in your final boxed answer; all sizes are to be interpreted in kb.", "solution": "The problem is first subjected to rigorous validation before any attempt at a solution.\n\nStep 1: Extract Givens.\nThe explicit information provided in the problem statement is as follows:\n- DNA molecule: A covalently closed circular plasmid.\n- Total length of plasmid: $L_{total} = 3$ kilobase pairs (kb).\n- Restriction endonuclease: EcoRI, which recognizes the sequence 5′-GAATTC-3′.\n- Number of EcoRI recognition sites: $N = 2$.\n- Arrangement of sites: The shortest arc distance between the two sites on the circular map is $d_{short} = 1$ kb.\n- Plasmid preparation: The plasmid is unmethylated.\n- Digestion condition: The plasmid is digested to completion, meaning every recognition site is cleaved.\n- Objective: Derive the sizes of all linear restriction fragments produced.\n- Output format: A row vector of fragment sizes in kilobase pairs (kb), ordered from smallest to largest.\n\nStep 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens.\nThe problem is evaluated against the required criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes a standard, fundamental procedure in molecular biology: the restriction digest of a plasmid DNA. The concepts of circular plasmids, restriction endonucleases (specifically EcoRI), recognition sites, methylation, and complete digestion are well-established and factually correct. The specified lengths are physically plausible. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is unambiguous and provides all necessary information for a unique solution. The total length of the circular DNA and the distance between the two cut sites are given. The term \"complete digestion\" has a precise technical meaning.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language, free from any subjective or non-scientific content.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity. The given data are consistent; the total length of the circle ($3$ kb) is composed of two arcs, one of which is specified ($1$ kb), implying the other must be $3-1 = 2$ kb. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nStep 3: Solution Derivation.\nThe core principle is that the cleavage of a DNA molecule by a restriction endonuclease at its recognition sites generates a set of smaller, linear DNA fragments. The number of fragments produced depends on the topology of the initial DNA molecule (linear or circular) and the number of recognition sites.\n\nFor a covalently closed circular DNA molecule with $N$ distinct recognition sites, a complete digestion (cleavage at every site) will result in exactly $N$ linear fragments.\nIn this problem, the plasmid is circular and has $N=2$ EcoRI recognition sites. Therefore, complete digestion will yield $2$ linear fragments.\n\nThe lengths of these two fragments are determined by the lengths of the two arcs of DNA connecting the two restriction sites on the circular plasmid. Let the total length of the circular plasmid be $L_{total}$. The plasmid is partitioned into two arcs by the two EcoRI sites.\n\nThe length of the shorter arc is given as $d_{1} = 1$ kb.\nThe length of the longer arc, $d_{2}$, must be the remainder of the total circular length. This is calculated as:\n$$d_{2} = L_{total} - d_{1}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$L_{total} = 3 \\text{ kb}$$\n$$d_{1} = 1 \\text{ kb}$$\nThus, the length of the second fragment is:\n$$d_{2} = 3 \\text{ kb} - 1 \\text{ kb} = 2 \\text{ kb}$$\n\nUpon complete digestion, the circular plasmid is cut at both sites, releasing the two arcs as two distinct linear molecules. The sizes of these linear fragments are therefore $d_{1} = 1$ kb and $d_{2} = 2$ kb.\n\nAs a necessary check for conservation of material, the sum of the lengths of the resulting fragments must equal the total length of the original plasmid:\n$$d_{1} + d_{2} = 1 \\text{ kb} + 2 \\text{ kb} = 3 \\text{ kb}$$\nThis sum is indeed equal to $L_{total}$, which confirms the correctness of the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be presented as a row vector of the fragment sizes, ordered from smallest to largest. The calculated fragment sizes are $1$ kb and $2$ kb. Ordered from smallest to largest, they are $1$ and $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2529955"}, {"introduction": "Having established how restriction enzymes cleave DNA, we now turn to the 'modification' aspect that makes these systems so powerful. This practice delves into the biochemical mechanism of protection, where methylation acts as a chemical shield for the host's genome. You will reason through how the presence of methyl groups in the DNA's major groove can inhibit enzyme binding and predict the starkly different outcomes when an enzyme encounters fully methylated, hemimethylated, and unmethylated recognition sites [@problem_id:2846351].", "problem": "A bacterium carries a restriction–modification system in which a Type II restriction endonuclease (R.Enz) and its cognate DNA methyltransferase (M.Enz) act on the same palindromic recognition site. The recognition sequence is a symmetric hexamer, and M.Enz adds a single methyl group per strand to a specific base within each half-site, projecting into the major groove. Biochemical measurements show that R.Enz functions as a homodimer that engages both half-sites simultaneously. Cleavage is concerted and requires formation of a dimer–DNA complex in which both monomers make base-specific hydrogen-bond contacts across the major groove; single-strand nicking by a monomer bound to only one half-site is negligible under the reaction conditions used here. Additional binding experiments demonstrate that methylation on either strand within the recognition site abolishes high-affinity binding by disrupting at least one essential base-specific contact per half-site.\n\nA circular plasmid of length $6000$ base pairs contains exactly $3$ R.Enz recognition sites that subdivide the plasmid into segments of $1000$, $2000$, and $3000$ base pairs when all sites are cleaved. Three preparations of this plasmid are available: (i) fully methylated at all three sites on both strands (as produced by M.Enz in vivo long after replication), (ii) hemimethylated at all three sites (as present immediately after replication, with the parental strand methylated and the nascent strand unmethylated), and (iii) completely unmethylated at all three sites (as isolated from a methyltransferase-null background). Each preparation is incubated with excess R.Enz under conditions that drive complete cleavage of any site that is kinetically competent to be cut.\n\nBased on the core definitions that Type II restriction endonucleases achieve sequence specificity through base-specific contacts in the major groove and that methylation alters the pattern of hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors and introduces steric bulk into the major groove, choose the single option that best integrates a mechanistic explanation of how methylation blocks cleavage with the correct prediction of digestion patterns for the fully methylated, hemimethylated, and unmethylated plasmid substrates.\n\nA. Mechanism: The methyl group in the major groove occludes and/or removes a critical hydrogen-bonding contact required for one monomer of the dimer to recognize its half-site, preventing assembly of the active dimer–DNA complex; methylation on either strand therefore blocks cleavage. Pattern: Fully methylated and hemimethylated plasmids resist cleavage and remain intact circles, whereas the unmethylated plasmid is completely digested into $3$ fragments of $1000$, $2000$, and $3000$ base pairs.\n\nB. Mechanism: Methylation weakens catalysis but not binding; one monomer can still cleave its strand even if the opposite half-site is methylated. Pattern: Fully methylated plasmid accumulates nicked open-circular molecules; hemimethylated plasmid becomes linearized at one site; unmethylated plasmid is digested into $3$ fragments of $1000$, $2000$, and $3000$ base pairs.\n\nC. Mechanism: Each monomer recognizes only its half-site independently and cleaves its corresponding strand regardless of methylation on the opposite strand. Pattern: Hemimethylated plasmid is digested to the same $3$-fragment pattern ($1000$, $2000$, $3000$ base pairs) as the unmethylated plasmid; fully methylated plasmid is partially protected but still yields some of these fragments.\n\nD. Mechanism: Methyl groups create hydrophobic patches that recruit R.Enz and stabilize the dimer–DNA complex. Pattern: Fully methylated plasmid is hyper-susceptible and is over-digested into fragments smaller than $1000$ base pairs; hemimethylated plasmid shows intermediate digestion; unmethylated plasmid shows minimal cleavage.", "solution": "The problem statement will be validated before a solution is attempted.\n\nFirst, the givens are extracted from the problem statement:\n1.  The system is a Type II restriction–modification system in a bacterium, consisting of a restriction endonuclease ($R.Enz$) and a DNA methyltransferase ($M.Enz$).\n2.  Both enzymes act on the same palindromic, symmetric hexamer recognition sequence.\n3.  $M.Enz$ adds one methyl group per strand to a base within each half-site, projecting into the major groove.\n4.  $R.Enz$ is a homodimer that binds both half-sites simultaneously.\n5.  $R.Enz$ cleavage is concerted and requires the formation of a dimer–DNA complex where both monomers make base-specific hydrogen-bond contacts.\n6.  Single-strand nicking by a monomer is negligible.\n7.  Methylation on either strand abolishes high-affinity binding by disrupting essential base-specific contacts.\n8.  The substrate is a circular plasmid of length $6000$ base pairs ($bp$).\n9.  The plasmid contains exactly $3$ $R.Enz$ recognition sites. Complete cleavage yields fragments of $1000$ $bp$, $2000$ $bp$, and $3000$ $bp$.\n10. Three plasmid preparations exist: (i) fully methylated (both strands at all sites), (ii) hemimethylated (one strand at all sites), and (iii) unmethylated (no methylation).\n11. The experiment is run with excess $R.Enz$ under conditions for complete digestion of any cleavable site.\n12. The core principle for analysis is that sequence specificity is via major groove contacts, which are altered by methylation (hydrogen bonding, steric hindrance).\n\nNext, the problem statement is validated against the required criteria.\n1.  **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is scientifically sound. It accurately describes the fundamental principles of Type II restriction-modification systems, including the homodimeric nature of many restriction enzymes, recognition of palindromic sequences, the role of major groove contacts for specificity, and the mechanism of protection by methylation. The concepts of fully methylated, hemimethylated, and unmethylated DNA are central to molecular biology.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear, self-contained set of rules governing the interaction between the enzyme and its substrate in different methylation states. The physical parameters of the plasmid ($6000$ $bp$ length, $3$ sites, fragment sizes of $1000$, $2000$, $3000$ $bp$) are consistent ($1000 + 2000 + 3000 = 6000$). The question asks for a logical deduction based on the provided information, for which a unique solution exists.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and unbiased scientific language.\n\nThe problem statement has no scientific, logical, or structural flaws. It is a valid problem. We may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe solution requires determining the action of $R.Enz$ on each of the three plasmid preparations based on the provided mechanistic rules. The central premise is that $R.Enz$ binding and subsequent cleavage are contingent on the formation of a specific dimer-DNA complex, which is disrupted by methylation.\n\nThe problem states: \"methylation on *either* strand within the recognition site abolishes high-affinity binding by disrupting at least one essential base-specific contact per half-site.\" This is the key rule. Because binding is abolished, the active dimer-DNA complex required for concerted cleavage cannot form. The explicit statement that \"single-strand nicking... is negligible\" further simplifies the outcome: if a site cannot be cleaved concertedly, it will not be nicked either. It will remain intact.\n\nLet us analyze the three substrates:\n1.  **Unmethylated plasmid:** This plasmid contains three recognition sites, none of which are methylated. There is nothing to inhibit the binding of the $R.Enz$ homodimer. Given excess enzyme and optimal conditions, the enzyme will bind and concertedly cleave all three sites. The cleavage of three sites on a circular molecule will produce three linear fragments. The sizes are given as $1000$ $bp$, $2000$ $bp$, and $3000$ $bp$. This outcome is certain.\n\n2.  **Fully methylated plasmid:** In this preparation, all three sites have methyl groups on both strands. According to the rule, methylation on either strand abolishes binding. Since both strands are methylated, binding is unequivocally abolished at all three sites. Therefore, no cleavage will occur. The plasmid will remain an intact $6000$ $bp$ circular molecule.\n\n3.  **Hemimethylated plasmid:** Here, each of the three recognition sites is methylated on only one strand. The rule is explicit: \"methylation on *either* strand... abolishes high-affinity binding\". The presence of a methyl group on just one strand is sufficient to prevent the formation of the active enzyme-DNA complex. Consequently, $R.Enz$ cannot cleave these hemimethylated sites. All three sites are protected, and the plasmid will remain an intact $6000$ $bp$ circular molecule.\n\nTo summarize the predicted digestion patterns:\n-   Unmethylated: Complete digestion into $3$ fragments ($1000$, $2000$, $3000$ $bp$).\n-   Hemimethylated: No digestion (intact $6000$ $bp$ circle).\n-   Fully methylated: No digestion (intact $6000$ $bp$ circle).\n\nNow, each option is evaluated.\n\n**A. Mechanism: The methyl group in the major groove occludes and/or removes a critical hydrogen-bonding contact required for one monomer of the dimer to recognize its half-site, preventing assembly of the active dimer–DNA complex; methylation on either strand therefore blocks cleavage. Pattern: Fully methylated and hemimethylated plasmids resist cleavage and remain intact circles, whereas the unmethylated plasmid is completely digested into $3$ fragments of $1000$, $2000$, and $3000$ base pairs.**\n-   The mechanism described is a precise restatement of the principles given in the problem: methylation interferes with major groove contacts, preventing binding of the dimer, thus blocking cleavage. It correctly concludes that methylation on either strand is sufficient for blockage.\n-   The predicted pattern matches our derivation perfectly: both fully methylated and hemimethylated plasmids are protected and remain circular, while the unmethylated plasmid is fully digested into the three expected fragments.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Mechanism: Methylation weakens catalysis but not binding; one monomer can still cleave its strand even if the opposite half-site is methylated. Pattern: Fully methylated plasmid accumulates nicked open-circular molecules; hemimethylated plasmid becomes linearized at one site; unmethylated plasmid is digested into $3$ fragments of $1000$, $2000$, and $3000$ base pairs.**\n-   The mechanism is incorrect. It claims methylation does not affect binding, which directly contradicts the problem statement that methylation \"abolishes high-affinity binding\". It also posits significant single-strand cleavage (nicking), which contradicts the statement that nicking is \"negligible\".\n-   The pattern is also incorrect and inconsistent with the problem's premises. Linearization of the hemimethylated plasmid is impossible if binding is abolished.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Mechanism: Each monomer recognizes only its half-site independently and cleaves its corresponding strand regardless of methylation on the opposite strand. Pattern: Hemimethylated plasmid is digested to the same $3$-fragment pattern ($1000$, $2000$, $3000$ base pairs) as the unmethylated plasmid; fully methylated plasmid is partially protected but still yields some of these fragments.**\n-   The mechanism is incorrect. It assumes independent monomer action, which is falsified by the problem's description of a homodimer that \"engages both half-sites simultaneously\" and performs \"concerted\" cleavage.\n-   The pattern is incorrect. It predicts that hemimethylated DNA is cleaved, which would require the enzyme to bind to a site containing a methyl group, an action explicitly prohibited by the rules given.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Mechanism: Methyl groups create hydrophobic patches that recruit R.Enz and stabilize the dimer–DNA complex. Pattern: Fully methylated plasmid is hyper-susceptible and is over-digested into fragments smaller than $1000$ base pairs; hemimethylated plasmid shows intermediate digestion; unmethylated plasmid shows minimal cleavage.**\n-   The mechanism is the antithesis of what is stated. It claims methylation *stabilizes* the enzyme-DNA complex, whereas the problem states it *abolishes* binding. This is a fundamental misreading.\n-   The pattern is consequentially inverted from the correct prediction. It suggests methylated DNA is the preferred substrate, which is biologically incorrect for a restriction-modification system designed for self-preservation.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nOnly option A provides both a mechanism and a predicted pattern that are fully consistent with all information given in the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2846351"}, {"introduction": "This final practice elevates your understanding from applying known rules to a scenario of scientific discovery.

It is a well-formulated question in molecular biology that can be solved by applying the canonical definitions of restriction-modification system types. A detailed analysis will now be performed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe classification of NucX requires a systematic comparison of its observed properties against the defining features of the major R–M system types.\n\n**Type I R–M Systems**:\n-   **Cofactors**: Require ATP, SAM, and $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ for activity. This is consistent with NucX.\n-   **Recognition Site**: Typically asymmetric and often bipartite. This is consistent with NucX's asymmetric site.\n-   **Cleavage Action**: These enzymes bind to their recognition site and then translocate DNA, cleaving at variable and distant sites, often more than $1000$ bp away from the recognition sequence. This is a **critical inconsistency** with NucX, which cleaves at a short, fixed distance of $25 \\pm 1$ bp.\n\n**Type II R–M Systems**:\n-   **Cofactors**: Canonical Type II enzymes require only $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ for cleavage. They do **not** require ATP or SAM. This is a **critical inconsistency** with NucX, which requires both ATP and SAM.\n-   **Recognition Site**: Typically palindromic. This is **inconsistent** with NucX's asymmetric site.\n-   **Cleavage Action**: Cleavage occurs at a specific position within or very close to the recognition site. While some subclasses (Type IIs) cleave at a short, fixed distance and can recognize asymmetric sites, the fundamental cofactor requirements (no ATP/SAM) rule out this classification.\n\n**Type III R–M Systems**:\n-   **Cofactors**: Require ATP and $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$. ATP hydrolysis fuels DNA translocation. This is **perfectly consistent** with NucX's requirement for ATP and the failure of $\\mathrm{ATP}\\gamma\\mathrm{S}$ to support activity. They also require SAM as an allosteric activator for restriction, though it is not consumed during cleavage. The observation that SAM is essential for NucX activity is the classic behavior of a Type III enzyme.\n-   **Recognition Site**: Asymmetric. This is **perfectly consistent** with NucX.\n-   **Cleavage Action**: These enzymes require two non-methylated recognition sites on the same DNA molecule, typically in a head-to-head (inverted) orientation. They bind to their respective sites and translocate toward each other. When the enzymes collide, DNA cleavage is triggered. This mechanism explains why a plasmid with a single site is not cleaved, whereas a plasmid with two inverted sites is an efficient substrate. This is **perfectly consistent** with NucX's substrate requirements.\n-   **Cleavage Position**: Cleavage occurs at a fixed, short distance (typically $25-27$ bp) to one side of *one* of the recognition sites upon collision of the two enzyme complexes. This is **perfectly consistent** with the observed cleavage at $25 \\pm 1$ bp from a site.\n\n**Type IV R–M Systems**:\n-   **Cofactors**: Variable, but not typically the ATP/SAM/$\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ combination in this manner. For example, the McrBC system, a well-known Type IV system, requires GTP, not ATP.\n-   **Cleavage Action**: These are not true R-M systems. They are restriction enzymes that specifically recognize and cleave **modified** (e.g., methylated or hydroxymethylated) DNA. The problem describes the cleavage of a standard, presumably unmodified, plasmid substrate. There is no indication that the substrate must be modified for cleavage. This is a **critical inconsistency**.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation**:\nThe full set of experimental observations for NucX—the requirement for ATP hydrolysis, SAM, and $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$; the need for two inverted asymmetric recognition sites; and cleavage at a fixed, short distance from one site—are the defining, hallmark characteristics of a Type III restriction-modification system.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nA. **Type I restriction–modification system**: While the cofactor requirements ($\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$, ATP, SAM) overlap, the cleavage position is a definitive point of exclusion. Type I enzymes cleave at random, distant locations, whereas NucX cleaves at a specific, proximal location ($25 \\pm 1$ bp). Therefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\nB. **Type II restriction–modification system (canonical palindromic-site cutters)**: This classification fails on multiple grounds. Canonical Type II enzymes do not require ATP or SAM for cleavage, and they typically recognize palindromic sequences. NucX requires both cofactors and recognizes an asymmetric sequence. Therefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\nC. **Type III restriction–modification system**: This classification is an exact match for all provided data points. The cofactor requirements ($\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$, ATP hydrolysis, SAM stimulation), the recognition site (asymmetric), the substrate requirement (two sites in inverted orientation), and the cleavage mechanism (fixed distance of $25 \\pm 1$ bp from one site after collision) are all canonical features of Type III systems. Therefore, this option is **Correct**.\n\nD. **Type IV restriction system (modification-dependent restriction)**: This option is incorrect because Type IV systems are defined by their targeting of modified DNA. The problem provides no evidence for this requirement and instead presents a classic set of features associated with a different R-M type. The described mechanism does not match that of a Type IV system. Therefore, this option is **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2529995"}]}
