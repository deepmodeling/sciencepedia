Let us proceed step-by-step.\n\nFact 3 states: \"The total number of capsid protein subunits equals the number of occupied quasi-equivalent lattice positions.\" This establishes a direct equality. If we let $N_{positions}$ be the total number of quasi-equivalent lattice positions on the entire capsid surface, then:\n$$N_{total} = N_{positions}$$\nThus, the problem is reduced to calculating the total number of these lattice positions.\n\nFact 1 states: \"An icosahedral object has $60$ proper rotational symmetries, and the icosahedral asymmetric unit is the minimal surface region that tiles the entire surface under these $60$ rotations.\" This means the entire surface of the icosahedral capsid is perfectly constructed from exactly $60$ copies of a single, fundamental region called the asymmetric unit. If we know the number of lattice positions within one asymmetric unit, the total number of positions on the entire surface will be $60$ times that value.\n\nFact 2 provides the final piece of information: \"In the Caspar–Klug construction, the triangulation number $T$ counts the number of quasi-equivalent lattice positions per icosahedral asymmetric unit...\" This directly defines $T$ as the quantity we need. The number of quasi-equivalent lattice positions per asymmetric unit is precisely $T$.\n\nCombining these facts, we can construct the general formula. The total number of lattice positions, $N_{positions}$, is the product of the number of asymmetric units that form the capsid and the number of lattice positions within each asymmetric unit.\n\nThe number of asymmetric units is $60$.\nThe number of lattice positions per asymmetric unit is $T$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of positions is:\n$$N_{positions} = 60 \\times T$$\n\nFrom our first step, we know that $N_{total} = N_{positions}$. Substituting this, we arrive at the general expression for the total number of subunits as a function of the triangulation number $T$:\n$$N_{total}(T) = 60T$$\nThis is the general expression required by the problem statement.\n\nThe problem then requires the evaluation of this expression for a capsid with a triangulation number of $T=7$.

The viral capsid proteins have basic arginine-rich motifs that bind the phosphate backbone of RNA, and their inter-capsomer contacts combine short-range hydrophobic attraction and long-range electrostatic terms. Assume dilute solution conditions where assembly proceeds by a nucleation-and-growth pathway, and electrostatic interactions are screened according to Debye–Hückel theory: the electrostatic potential decays as $\\exp(-\\kappa r)/r$ with screening parameter $\\kappa$ and Debye length $\\lambda_{D} = 1/\\kappa$, where for a monovalent electrolyte at temperature $T$,\n$$\n\\lambda_{D} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon k_{B} T}{2 N_{A} e^{2} I}},\n$$\nwith $\\varepsilon$ the solvent permittivity, $k_{B}$ the Boltzmann constant, $N_{A}$ Avogadro’s number, and $e$ the elementary charge.

The yield is bell-shaped (maximal at intermediate $I$): at very low $I$ (large $\\lambda_{D}$), long-range electrostatics are strong, so protein–protein repulsion and excessively strong RNA–protein binding promote kinetic traps and mis-assembly; increasing $I$ partially screens repulsion more rapidly than it erodes the RNA–protein driving force, lowering nucleation barriers and favoring correct growth; at high $I$ (small $\\lambda_{D}$), screening weakens RNA–protein attraction so much that nucleation and growth are underdriven, reducing yield.\n\nB. The yield increases monotonically with $I$: salt screens electrostatic repulsion among proteins, so higher $I$ always lowers barriers and enhances assembly, while attractive RNA–protein interactions are largely unaffected by screening.\n\nC. The yield decreases monotonically with $I$: salt primarily screens the attractive RNA–protein interactions that drive assembly, so increasing $I$ weakens nucleation and growth, whereas protein–protein repulsion is negligible.\n\nD. The yield is U-shaped (minimal at intermediate $I$): at both very low and very high $I$, assembly is favored because electrostatics either strongly attract proteins to RNA (low $I$) or are irrelevant (high $I$), while at intermediate $I$ the RNA collapses too compactly to template capsid formation, causing the lowest yield.\n\nE.

Acknowledge that overly strong RNA-protein attraction can lead to kinetic traps (malformed aggregates), while too-weak attraction prevents nucleation.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as it uses established principles of physical chemistry and biophysics (Debye-Hückel theory, nucleation-and-growth, competing interactions in self-assembly) to describe a real biological phenomenon (viral capsid formation). The properties ascribed to RNA and proteins are factually correct. The problem is well-posed, asking for a qualitative conclusion based on a clearly defined set of physical rules. It is objective and uses precise scientific language. It is not incomplete, contradictory, or trivial. The competing effects described present a substantive reasoning challenge that reflects a real aspect of virology. Therefore, the problem statement is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding how ionic strength, $I$, modulates the electrostatic interactions and, consequently, the kinetics and thermodynamics of capsid assembly.\n\nThe Debye length, $\\lambda_D$, characterizes the screening length of electrostatic interactions in an electrolyte solution. The provided formula, $\\lambda_{D} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{I}$, indicates that as the ionic strength $I$ increases, the Debye length $\\lambda_D$ decreases. A shorter Debye length implies stronger screening, which means that electrostatic interactions are weakened and become more short-ranged. This screening effect applies to all electrostatic interactions in the system.\n\nLet us analyze the three contributions to the free energy of assembly as a function of $I$:\n\n1.  **Attractive RNA-protein electrostatics**: The RNA is anionic and the protein's binding motifs are cationic. This attraction is the primary driving force for localizing proteins on the RNA template. As $I$ increases, this attraction is screened and becomes weaker.\n2.  **Repulsive protein-protein electrostatics**: The problem specifies repulsive electrostatic interactions between protein capsomers. This term creates an energy barrier that opposes the close packing required for the formation of the ordered capsid structure. As $I$ increases, this repulsion is screened and becomes weaker.\n3.  **Non-electrostatic short-range protein-protein attraction**: This term, identified as hydrophobic attraction, is stated to be approximately independent of $I$. It provides the final stabilization once proteins are correctly oriented at close range.\n\nWe now synthesize these effects across the range of ionic strength $I$:\n\n-   **At very low $I$ (approaching $I=0$)**: The Debye length $\\lambda_D$ is very large, and electrostatic screening is minimal. Both the attractive RNA-protein interaction and the repulsive protein-protein interaction are very strong and long-ranged. The extremely strong, non-specific attraction between the highly charged RNA and proteins leads to rapid, disordered aggregation. Proteins become irreversibly stuck to the RNA in incorrect positions, leading to kinetically trapped, malformed structures. Additionally, the strong repulsion between proteins creates a high kinetic barrier, preventing them from rearranging into the correct, compact icosahedral geometry. The combination of these effects results in a very low yield of correctly assembled capsids.\n\n-   **At very high $I$**: The Debye length $\\lambda_D$ is very small. All electrostatic interactions are strongly screened and weak. The attractive RNA-protein interaction, which is the essential driving force for initiating assembly, becomes too feeble to effectively nucleate the process. Proteins have low affinity for the RNA template and for each other (in an electrostatic sense), so they do not accumulate on the RNA surface to initiate and propagate capsid growth. While the repulsive barrier is also gone, the primary thermodynamic drive is absent. This leads to a failure of assembly and, consequently, a very low yield.\n\n-   **At intermediate $I$**: There exists an optimal range of ionic strength where the competing effects are balanced.\n    -   The ionic strength is high enough to sufficiently screen the repulsive protein-protein interactions. This lowers the kinetic barrier for correct packing, allowing proteins to diffuse on the RNA surface and find their proper lattice positions.\n    -   Simultaneously, the ionic strength is low enough that the attractive RNA-protein electrostatic interaction remains sufficiently strong to drive nucleation and localize proteins on the template, but not so strong as to cause irreversible non-specific binding.\n    -   This \"Goldilocks\" condition—weakened repulsion and still-sufficient attraction—allows for efficient and high-fidelity nucleation and growth, leading to a maximal yield of correctly formed capsids.\n\nTherefore, the qualitative dependence of the yield of correctly formed capsids on the ionic strength $I$ is a bell-shaped curve: it is low at both low and high $I$, and maximal at an intermediate $I$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.** This option proposes a bell-shaped yield. The justification for low $I$ is that strong electrostatics (both protein-protein repulsion and RNA-protein attraction) promote kinetic traps and mis-assembly. The justification for increasing $I$ is the screening of repulsion, which lowers kinetic barriers. The justification for high $I$ is the excessive screening of the crucial RNA-protein attraction, which weakens the driving force for assembly. This reasoning is in perfect accord with our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.** This option proposes a monotonically increasing yield. It incorrectly assumes that the attractive RNA-protein interactions are unaffected by screening, which contradicts Debye-Hückel theory. It also ignores the fact that at sufficiently high $I$, the driving force for assembly will be eliminated.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** This option proposes a monotonically decreasing yield. It incorrectly assumes that protein-protein repulsion is negligible and ignores the detrimental effect of strong repulsion at low $I$, which a moderate amount of salt helps to alleviate.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** This option proposes a U-shaped yield, which is the opposite of the derived behavior. Its reasoning is flawed: strong attraction at low $I$ leads to mis-assembly, not favored assembly. It also introduces a mechanism of RNA collapse that is not required by, or central to, the principles laid out in the problem statement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E.** This option proposes a bell-shaped yield but provides an incorrect mechanism. It claims the hydrophobic effect is salt-dependent in a way that maximizes contacts at intermediate $I$, and that electrostatics are insignificant. This directly contradicts the problem statement, which specifies that hydrophobic attraction is $I$-independent and that electrostatics are the key $I$-dependent factors.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2544625"}, {"introduction": "Once a viral particle or its components are assembled, they must navigate the dense and complex environment of the cell to reach an egress site.
