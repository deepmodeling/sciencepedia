{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A defining feature of giant viruses is their massive and complex genomes, a significant fraction of which consists of genes with no detectable homologs in existing databases. This exercise guides you through the fundamental task of quantifying these \"orphan genes\" or ORFans [@problem_id:2496668]. By applying precise bioinformatic definitions to categorize genes from a hypothetical Pandoravirus genome, you will calculate the ratio of genes with known functional domains to those that are completely novel, providing a quantitative basis for exploring hypotheses about their unique evolutionary origins.", "problem": "A newly assembled Pandoravirus genome was annotated using a standardized pipeline combining profile hidden Markov model searches against the Pfam-A database and sequence similarity searches against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant (nr) and Viral Reference Sequence (RefSeq) databases. Use the following foundational definitions to classify genes and compute a summary metric:\n\n1. Definition of recognizable domain: a protein has a recognizable domain if it has at least one Pfam-A hit detected by profile hidden Markov model search (e.g., HMMER) with E-value $E < 10^{-5}$ and domain coverage $\\ge 0.5$ of the hidden Markov model length.\n2. Definition of orphan gene (ORFan): a protein is an ORFan if it has no significant sequence similarity to any protein in the NCBI non-redundant or Viral RefSeq databases (BLASTp E-value $E < 10^{-5}$ threshold for significance) and no recognizable Pfam-A domain by the criteria in 1. Proteins with only low-complexity regions, coiled-coils, or transmembrane helices predicted are not considered to have recognizable domains, and if they lack significant similarity by BLASTp they are considered ORFans.\n\nThe annotation run yields the following mutually exclusive categories among $2400$ predicted protein-coding genes:\n\n- Category A: $300$ proteins with at least one recognizable Pfam-A domain per the above criteria.\n- Category B: $300$ proteins without recognizable Pfam-A domains but with significant BLASTp homologs in NCBI non-redundant or Viral RefSeq (E-value $E < 10^{-5}$).\n- Category C: $400$ proteins with only low-complexity, coiled-coil, or transmembrane predictions and no significant BLASTp homologs.\n- Category D: $1400$ proteins with no significant matches by either Pfam-A or BLASTp.\n\nBy the definitions above, the set of genes with recognizable domains is Category A, and the set of ORFans is the union of Categories C and D.\n\nUsing only these definitions and the basic rules of counting and proportions, compute the ratio $P$ of the number of genes with recognizable domains to the number of ORFans, that is,\n$$\nP \\equiv \\frac{N_{\\text{domain}}}{N_{\\text{ORFan}}}.\n$$\nReport your answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.

Proteins with only low-complexity regions, coiled-coils, or transmembrane helices are specified as not having recognizable domains.\n- Mutually exclusive gene categories:\n    - Category A: $300$ proteins with recognizable Pfam-A domains.\n    - Category B: $300$ proteins without recognizable Pfam-A domains but with significant BLASTp homologs.\n    - Category C: $400$ proteins with only low-complexity, coiled-coil, or transmembrane predictions and no significant BLASTp homologs.\n    - Category D: $1400$ proteins with no significant matches by either Pfam-A or BLASTp.\n- Explicit classification: Genes with recognizable domains are Category A. ORFans are the union of Categories C and D.\n- Task: Compute the ratio $P \\equiv \\frac{N_{\\text{domain}}}{N_{\\text{ORFan}}}$, rounded to four significant figures, and discuss implications.\n\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of genomics and bioinformatics. It is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and data, which are internally consistent (the sum of categories $300 + 300 + 400 + 1400 = 2400$ matches the total number of genes). The language is objective and precise. Therefore, we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the ratio $P$, defined as:\n$$\nP = \\frac{N_{\\text{domain}}}{N_{\\text{ORFan}}}\n$$\nwhere $N_{\\text{domain}}$ is the number of genes with recognizable domains and $N_{\\text{ORFan}}$ is the number of orphan genes (ORFans).\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the set of genes with recognizable domains is explicitly defined as Category A. The number of genes in this category is given as $300$.\n$$\nN_{\\text{domain}} = 300\n$$\n\nThe set of ORFans is defined as the union of Categories C and D. The definition of an ORFan is a gene product with no detectable homology (BLASTp $E < 10^{-5}$) and no recognizable functional domain (Pfam-A $E < 10^{-5}$).\n- Category C consists of $400$ proteins with no significant BLASTp homologs and only features (low-complexity, coiled-coils, transmembrane helices) that are explicitly excluded from being considered recognizable domains. These genes therefore satisfy the definition of an ORFan.\n- Category D consists of $1400$ proteins with no significant matches by either Pfam-A or BLASTp. These genes also satisfy the definition of an ORFan.\n\nSince the categories are stated to be mutually exclusive, the total number of ORFans is the sum of the counts from Category C and Category D.\n$$\nN_{\\text{ORFan}} = (\\text{Number in Category C}) + (\\text{Number in Category D}) = 400 + 1400 = 1800\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the ratio $P$:\n$$\nP = \\frac{N_{\\text{domain}}}{N_{\\text{ORFan}}} = \\frac{300}{1800} = \\frac{1}{6}\n$$\n\nTo provide the answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, we convert the fraction:\n$$\nP = 0.16666...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures yields:\n$$\nP \\approx 0.1667\n$$\n\nWe now proceed to the conceptual analysis as requested. The computed ratio is small, indicating that genes with recognizable, conserved domains are heavily outnumbered by ORFans in this Pandoravirus genome. This profound imbalance has significant implications for understanding the origin and evolution of giant viruses.\n\nThe high prevalence of ORFans relative to genes with known homologs challenges the hypothesis that giant virus genomes are merely assemblages of genes acquired from their hosts or other known viral lineages. Such a low ratio of conserved genes to ORFans supports alternative, non-mutually exclusive hypotheses. First, it is consistent with a high rate of *de novo* gene origination from previously non-coding sequences within the viral genome. This would position giant viruses as \"cradles\" of genetic innovation, constantly generating novel proteins. Second, the ORFans could be ancient genes that have undergone such rapid sequence evolution that their homology to orthologs in other life forms is no longer detectable by standard bioinformatic methods. This would imply an exceptionally high evolutionary rate, obscuring their distant ancestry. Finally, this genomic composition is compatible with the hypothesis that giant viruses represent a deep, ancient evolutionary lineage—perhaps a \"fourth domain\" of life—that diverged from the ancestors of cellular organisms long ago. In this scenario, the ORFans would represent lineage-specific genes that evolved within this viral domain, with functions tailored to a unique virocentric lifestyle, and thus lack recognizable homologs in cellular domains. In any of these interpretations, the dominance of ORFans underscores that giant viruses are a major source of unknown biological functions and a frontier for discovering novel evolutionary mechanisms.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.1667}\n$$", "id": "2496668"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the mystery of ORFans, giant virus genomes startle researchers with what they *do* contain: an expanded repertoire of genes typically associated with cellular life, particularly those involved in protein translation.

This exercise moves beyond mere calculation to the crucial skill of designing robust validation strategies, ensuring that profound evolutionary inferences are built on a solid foundation of reliable data.", "problem": "Giant viruses in the family Mimiviridae and related lineages have genomes that encode numerous translation-related factors but lack complete ribosomes. The Central Dogma of molecular biology asserts that protein synthesis occurs on ribosomes, and viruses generally rely on host ribosomes. Consequently, any claim that a giant virus encodes bona fide ribosomal proteins must clear a high evidentiary bar, because such claims have substantial evolutionary implications. Two well-tested facts establish a fundamental base: (i) profile searches with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are sensitive but can yield false positives when matches are fragmentary or domain-shuffled, and (ii) metagenome assemblies can contain chimeric or contaminant contigs that can be diagnosed by coverage, composition, linkage, and assembly-graph features.

The problem statement itself establishes the high evidentiary bar required to substantiate the claim that a giant virus encodes a ribosomal protein, given the profound evolutionary implications. It also provides essential facts regarding the potential pitfalls of bioinformatic analyses, namely false positives from profile searches and contamination in metagenome assemblies.\n\nThe problem asks for the identification of a workflow that is both necessary and sufficient to prevent an erroneous claim, based on a specific, detailed scenario. Let us first evaluate the evidence provided in the scenario.\n\nA putative viral metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) contains a contig with a gene annotated as ribosomal protein L22. Several pieces of evidence are provided to assess the validity of this gene's association with the virus:\n\n1.  **Genomic Composition and Coverage:** The contig in question has a length of $42{,}150$ base pairs, a guanine-cytosine (GC) content of $44\\%$, and a mean depth of coverage of $70\\times$. In contrast, the remaining viral contigs have a median GC content of $28\\%$ and a median coverage of $35\\times$. The significant discrepancies in both GC content ($44\\%$ versus $28\\%$) and coverage ($70\\times$ versus $35\\times$) are powerful indicators that this contig originates from a different biological entity than the one represented by the bulk of the viral MAG. In metagenomic binning, contigs from the same genome are expected to exhibit similar composition and co-varying coverage across samples.\n\n2.  **Read-Pair Linkage:** The analysis of paired-end reads reveals that over $90\\%$ of read pairs that span the boundaries of the anomalous contig connect to contigs from the eukaryotic algal host, not to other viral contigs. This is extremely strong evidence of a misassembly or contamination. It suggests the contig is either physically adjacent to the host DNA in its true genome of origin or represents a bacterial symbiont/contaminant whose DNA is physically proximal to the host DNA in the sample, and has been incorrectly binned with the virus. Alternatively, it could be a chimeric assembly artifact, incorrectly joining sequence from two different organisms.\n\n3.  **Homology Search Quality:** A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) search against the Protein Families (PFAM) database yields a hit to the L22 family with a bit score of $120$. While this score may seem significant, the model coverage is only $35\\%$. A true, functional ortholog is expected to align to nearly the entire length of the conserved domain model. A partial match is a classic sign of a non-orthologous hit, a fragmentary gene, or a match to a different protein family that shares a small conserved domain.\n\n4.  **Orthology and Phylogeny:** The Reciprocal Best Hit (RBH) is to a bacterial ribosomal protein L22. A preliminary phylogenetic analysis further places the sequence within a bacterial clade with high bootstrap support ($>90\\%$). This directly contradicts a viral origin and points strongly to a bacterial source.\n\n5.  **Gene Context:** The gene is in a \"genomic desert\" with respect to viral genes; it lacks nearby viral hallmark genes. Genes in a genome, particularly in viruses, often exhibit some degree of functional clustering or synteny. The absence of viral context is another piece of evidence against its inclusion in the viral genome.\n\nIn summary, every piece of quantitative evidence presented in the problem statement argues *against* the hypothesis that the ribosomal protein gene belongs to the giant virus. It is overwhelmingly likely a contaminant contig from a bacterium, which is either associated with the eukaryotic host or was simply co-sequenced. A necessary and sufficient workflow must therefore be capable of detecting and correctly interpreting all of these signals to reject the false positive claim.\n\nNow, we evaluate the proposed options.\n\n**A. Accept the annotation if there is any significant HMM match to PFAM and an RBH to a ribosomal protein, regardless of model coverage, gene context, or assembly features. Provide the final contig sequence in a supplementary file without raw read access or code, because the primary evidence is the annotation itself.**\nThis workflow is fundamentally unsound. It relies on a superficial interpretation of annotation results while explicitly ignoring all the critical counter-evidence: aberrant GC content, differential coverage, partial HMM model coverage, and problematic read-pair linkage. It represents a naive approach that is highly prone to false positives. Furthermore, its stance on reproducibility—withholding raw data and code—is antithetical to modern scientific standards and makes the claim entirely unverifiable. This is a perfect example of what *not* to do.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Require an end-to-end, preregistered and scripted pipeline with: deposition of raw reads to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) with accession numbers; version-controlled code and environment with pinned database releases and containerization; assembly-graph export and visualization; per-contig depth, GC content, tetranucleotide composition, and linkage profiles; read-pair linkage analysis across contig boundaries; independent reassemblies and cross-sample co-occurrence checks; domain-centric HMM annotation enforcing model coverage and conserved site checks; orthology assessment using reciprocal and graph-based methods; phylogenetic placement with dense taxon sampling, model adequacy checks, and tests for long-branch attraction; explicit decision rules that claim a ribosomal gene only if (i) model coverage is $>70\\%$, (ii) the gene lies on contigs with viral hallmark genes, (iii) coverage and composition are within $2$ standard deviations of the viral genome median, (iv) read-pair links connect predominantly to viral contigs, (v) independent assemblies converge, and (vi) phylogenetic support places the sequence with bona fide viral homologs with posterior probability $>0.95$. Publish all intermediate artifacts with cryptographic checksums and Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs).**\nThis option presents a gold-standard, comprehensive workflow.\n*   **Reproducibility:** It addresses reproducibility at every level, from raw data deposition (SRA) and version-controlled, containerized code to the publication of all intermediate artifacts with checksums. This ensures full transparency and repeatability, as demanded by the problem statement.\n*   **Scientific Rigor:** It systematically incorporates every necessary check to validate a contig's assignment to a MAG. It explicitly calls for analysis of coverage and composition (`depth, GC content, tetranucleotide composition`), linkage (`read-pair linkage analysis`), assembly integrity (`assembly-graph export`, `independent reassemblies`), homology quality (`enforcing model coverage`), and robust phylogenetics (`dense taxon sampling`, `model adequacy checks`).\n*   **Decision Logic:** Crucially, it formulates a set of clear, stringent, and multi-faceted decision rules. These rules directly map to the indicators of contamination discussed above. For the given scenario, the ribosomal protein contig would fail rules (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), and (vi), leading to its correct rejection. This workflow is both necessary (omitting any of these steps creates a loophole for errors) and sufficient (it covers all standard bases for this type of claim).\n**Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**C. Validate the gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using primers flanking the open reading frame; if a band of the expected size appears, accept the claim. No need to sequence the amplicon, deposit raw reads, examine assembly graphs, or assess phylogeny, because amplification proves presence.**\nThis experimental approach is fatally flawed. A successful PCR from a metagenomic DNA sample only confirms that the target sequence is present in the bulk sample. It provides no information about the genomic origin of that sequence. Given the evidence that the contig is bacterial, one would fully expect the PCR to yield a product from the bacterial DNA present in the sample. This result would be a true positive for the *presence* of the gene in the sample, but a false positive for its *presence in the viral genome*. Not sequencing the amplicon is an additional layer of poor practice. This method completely fails to address the central question of genomic linkage and context.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Use metatranscriptomic evidence: detect transcripts aligning to the candidate gene with fragments per kilobase per million (FPKM) above a threshold, and accept the claim as functionally expressed in the viral genome. Reproducibility consists of reporting the RNA sequencing aligner version; assembly provenance, read-pair linkage, and contamination screening are unnecessary because expression implies authenticity.**\nThis logic is as fallacious as that in option C. The detection of transcripts (metatranscriptomics) proves only that a gene is expressed by *some organism* in the sampled community. If the gene belongs to a metabolically active bacterium, it will be transcribed. This does not prove its origin is viral. The statement \"expression implies authenticity\" is a dangerous oversimplification that ignores the fundamental problem of contamination and chimerism in metagenome-assembled genomes. The proposed reproducibility standard is also grossly inadequate.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Implement an advanced annotation and phylogenetics workflow with strict expectation value thresholds and model-testing, and filter contigs by length $>10$ kilobases to define the viral genome. Consider any long contig with a ribosomal annotation as viral if its best hit is to a ribosomal protein. Reproducibility is addressed by listing software names but omitting code, containers, database versions, and intermediate artifacts to simplify dissemination.**\nThis option contains a facade of sophistication that masks a simplistic and incorrect core logic. While \"advanced annotation and phylogenetics\" sounds good, the decision rule—\"Consider any long contig... as viral if its best hit is to a ribosomal protein\"—is naive and would lead to the incorrect acceptance of the contaminant contig in this scenario. It ignores the far more powerful evidence from GC content, coverage, and linkage. The proposed approach to reproducibility is also weak; listing software names without versions, parameters, scripts, or container definitions is insufficient for true reproducibility. \"Simplifying dissemination\" is not a valid justification for non-reproducible science.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, only Option B describes a workflow that meets the high evidentiary bar set by the problem statement. It combines computational and genomic best practices with a rigorous framework for reproducibility, making it both necessary and sufficient to avoid the erroneous claim described.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2496648"}]}
