They have cloned the candidate toxin gene into a plasmid, pTOX, under the control of an arabinose-inducible promoter (P_ara). They have also cloned the candidate antitoxin gene into a second plasmid, pANTI, under the control of an Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) inducible promoter (P_lac). Both plasmids carry different antibiotic resistance markers, and they are co-transformed into a suitable strain of *E. coli* that does not have these genes natively.\n\nAn overnight liquid culture of the co-transformed *E. coli* is grown in a medium containing both antibiotics but without any inducers. This culture is then diluted and spread-plated onto four different types of solid agar plates. Each plate contains the necessary antibiotics to maintain the plasmids. The plates are supplemented with inducers as follows:\n- Plate 1: No inducers\n- Plate 2: Arabinose only\n- Plate 3: IPTG only\n- Plate 4: Arabinose and IPTG\n\nAfter incubation, the number of viable colonies on each plate is observed.

The stated biological principles are:\n- Inducible promoters drive expression only in the presence of their specific inducer; without inducer, expression is minimal and not expected to affect viability in a way that produces many colonies unless stated otherwise.\n- The toxin is lethal unless neutralized by the antitoxin.\n- The antitoxin alone is not harmful.\n\nEvaluate each plate:\n- Plate 1 (no inducers): Neither toxin nor antitoxin is induced. With no toxin produced, cells remain viable. Expect many colonies.\n- Plate 2 (arabinose only): Toxin is induced, antitoxin is not. The toxin is lethal in the absence of antitoxin, so cells die. Expect no or very few colonies.\n- Plate 3 (IPTG only): Antitoxin is induced, toxin is not. Antitoxin alone is not harmful, and no toxin is present.
