In untreated cells, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) reveals a stereotyped distribution of histone marks across BESs: the active BES shows promoter-proximal enrichment of trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 ($\\mathrm{H3K4me3}$), whereas silent BESs show telomere-proximal enrichment of trimethylated histone H3 lysine 9 ($\\mathrm{H3K9me3}$). Cells are then treated for $24$ hours with a selective histone methyltransferase inhibitor that blocks deposition of $\\mathrm{H3K9me3}$, without directly affecting enzymes that write $\\mathrm{H3K4me3}$. You obtain new ChIP-seq and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) sequencing (RNA-seq) data for three BESs: BES$_A$ (initially active), BES$_B$ (initially silent), and BES$_C$ (initially silent). The measurements are summarized qualitatively as follows:\n\n- BES$_A$: $\\mathrm{H3K4me3}$ at the promoter decreases by approximately $60\\%$, $\\mathrm{H3K9me3}$ at the telomeric region remains low, VSG$_A$ mRNA decreases by approximately $70\\%$.\n- BES$_B$: $\\mathrm{H3K9me3}$ at the telomeric region decreases by approximately $80\\%$, $\\mathrm{H3K4me3}$ at the promoter increases by approximately $3$-fold, VSG$_B$ mRNA increases by approximately $10$-fold.\n- BES$_C$: $\\mathrm{H3K9me3}$ decreases modestly by approximately $20\\%$, $\\mathrm{H3K4me3}$ shows no significant change, VSG$_C$ mRNA remains near background.\n\nAssume the following foundational facts: (i) by the Central Dogma, increased promoter-proximal activating chromatin marks correlate with increased transcription and mRNA levels, while repressive chromatin marks correlate with transcriptional silencing; (ii) $\\mathrm{H3K9me3}$ is a heterochromatin mark associated with gene silencing, maintained by histone methyltransferases, and $\\mathrm{H3K4me3}$ is an euchromatin mark associated with transcription initiation; (iii) monoallelic expression is enforced during antigenic variation such that sustained activation of one BES is typically accompanied by silencing of others after any transient multi-allelic phase.\n\nBased on the data and these principles, which option best infers the direction of VSG switching after inhibitor treatment?\n\nA.

We analyze the state of each BES after the $24$-hour treatment.\n\n1.  **Analysis of BES$_A$ (Initially Active):**\n    The data show a $\\approx 60\\%$ decrease in the activating mark $\\mathrm{H3K4me3}$ at the promoter and a corresponding $\\approx 70\\%$ decrease in VSG$_A$ mRNA. According to the provided principles, the loss of an activating mark leads to reduced transcription. This indicates that BES$_A$ is undergoing silencing or significant attenuation of its expression.\n\n2.  **Analysis of BES$_B$ (Initially Silent):**\n    The treatment is an inhibitor of the enzyme that deposits $\\mathrm{H3K9me3}$. The observed $\\approx 80\\%$ decrease in this repressive mark at BES$_B$ is the expected direct effect. This removal of a silencing signal is followed by a $\\approx 3$-fold increase in the activating mark $\\mathrm{H3K4me3}$ and a dramatic $\\approx 10$-fold increase in VSG$_B$ mRNA. This combination of events—loss of a repressive mark, gain of an activating mark, and a large increase in transcription—is the definitive signature of gene activation. BES$_B$ is switching from a silent to an active state.\n\n3.  **Analysis of BES$_C$ (Initially Silent):**\n    Despite being initially silent like BES$_B$, BES$_C$ responds differently. The repressive mark $\\mathrm{H3K9me3}$ decreases only modestly ($\\approx 20\\%$), and critically, there is no subsequent gain in the activating mark $\\mathrm{H3K4me3}$ or in VSG$_C$ mRNA, which remains at background levels. This indicates that BES$_C$ has not been activated and remains in a silent state. The experimental data show a differential response among silent loci, but the outcome for BES$_C$ is unambiguous: it is not turning on.\n\n4.  **Synthesis:**\n    The parasite's gene expression program is shifting. The initially active site, BES$_A$, is being silenced. Simultaneously, one of the initially silent sites, BES$_B$, is being robustly activated. The other silent site, BES$_C$, remains silent. This coordinated silencing of the old active gene and activation of a new one is the definition of antigenic switching. The direction of this switch is from BES$_A$ to BES$_B$. This observation is also consistent with the principle of monoallelic expression, which states that activation of one BES is coupled with the silencing of others.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Switching toward BES$_B$ (from BES$_A$ to BES$_B$), consistent with de-repression and activation of BES$_B$ coupled to attenuation of BES$_A$.**\nThis statement accurately summarizes our analysis. The data show de-repression of BES$_B$ (loss of $\\mathrm{H3K9me3}$) leading to its activation (gain of $\\mathrm{H3K4me3}$ and mRNA). This is coupled with the attenuation of BES$_A$ (loss of $\\mathrm{H3K4me3}$ and mRNA). This describes a switching event from BES$_A$ to BES$_B$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Switching toward BES$_C$ (from BES$_A$ to BES$_C$), because both silent BESs lost $\\mathrm{H3K9me3}$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The primary reason is that the data for BES$_C$ show it remains transcriptionally silent, with no increase in $\\mathrm{H3K4me3}$ or mRNA. Therefore, no switching toward BES$_C$ has occurred. The premise \"because both silent BESs lost $\\mathrm{H3K9me3}$\" is a misleading oversimplification, as the magnitude of loss was drastically different and did not lead to activation in the case of BES$_C$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. No directional switching occurred; BES$_A$ remains the dominant active site despite transient changes.**\nThis statement is inconsistent with the data. A $\\approx 70\\%$ drop in VSG$_A$ mRNA, coupled with a $\\approx 10$-fold rise in VSG$_B$ mRNA, represents a massive shift in the transcriptional landscape, not a \"transient change\". It is highly probable that after $24$ hours, BES$_B$ has become the dominant active site, or is in the process of doing so. The evidence strongly points to a directional switch in progress.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Simultaneous stable activation of BES$_A$, BES$_B$, and BES$_C$ is the most likely outcome under global $\\mathrm{H3K9me3}$ loss.**\nThis statement is contradicted by both the experimental data and the provided principles. The data show that BES$_A$ is being inactivated and BES$_C$ remains inactive; thus, simultaneous activation is not occurring. Furthermore, the problem states that the system enforces monoallelic expression, making the simultaneous stable activation of multiple BESs an unlikely outcome.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2525997"}, {"introduction": "Antigenic switching allows parasites to achieve long-term persistence by generating a sequence of antigenically distinct waves within a single host.
