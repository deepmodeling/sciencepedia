The problem suggests using biologically motivated scales that expose the relative timescales. The characteristic rates in the system are the pathogen growth rate, $r$, and the immune effector turnover rate, $\\delta$. The timescale for pathogen dynamics is on the order of $1/r$, while the timescale for immune dynamics is on the order of $1/\\delta$. The problem asks to analyze the system on the slow timescale of pathogen growth, so we choose the characteristic time $t_c = 1/r$. For the state variables, we use their natural maximum scales: the pathogen carrying capacity $K$ for $P$, and the maximum possible steady-state concentration of immune effectors, $I_{max} = \\alpha/\\delta$, for $I$.\n\nThe dimensionless variables, denoted by lowercase letters, are defined as:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{t}{t_c} = rt, \\quad p(\\tau) = \\frac{P(t)}{K}, \\quad i(\\tau) = \\frac{I(t)}{\\alpha/\\delta}\n$$\nFrom these definitions, we have $t = \\tau/r$, $P = pK$, and $I = i(\\alpha/\\delta)$. We now perform a change of variables in the governing equations. The time derivative transforms as $\\frac{d}{dt} = \\frac{d\\tau}{dt}\\frac{d}{d\\tau} = r\\frac{d}{d\\tau}$.\n\nSubstituting into Equation (1) for pathogen dynamics:\n$$\nr\\frac{d(pK)}{d\\tau} = r(pK)\\left(1 - \\frac{pK}{K}\\right) - k\\left(i\\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta}\\right)(pK)\n$$\n$$\nrK\\frac{dp}{d\\tau} = rpK(1 - p) - \\frac{k\\alpha K}{\\delta} ip\n$$\nDividing the entire equation by $rK$ yields the dimensionless equation for $p$:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{d\\tau} = p(1 - p) - \\left(\\frac{k\\alpha}{r\\delta}\\right) ip \\quad (3)\n$$\n\nNext, substituting into Equation (2) for immune effector dynamics:\n$$\nr\\frac{d}{d\\tau}\\left(i\\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta}\\right) = \\alpha\\frac{pK}{pK + \\theta} - \\delta\\left(i\\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{r\\alpha}{\\delta}\\frac{di}{d\\tau} = \\alpha\\frac{pK}{K(p + \\theta/K)} - i\\alpha\n$$\nDividing the entire equation by $\\alpha$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{r}{\\delta}\\frac{di}{d\\tau} = \\frac{p}{p + \\theta/K} - i \\quad (4)\n$$\n\nThe complete dimensionless system is:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{d\\tau} = p(1 - p) - \\kappa ip\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon\\frac{di}{d\\tau} = \\frac{p}{p+\\eta} - i\n$$\nwhere we have identified three dimensionless parameters:\n$$\n\\epsilon = \\frac{r}{\\delta}, \\quad \\kappa = \\frac{k\\alpha}{r\\delta}, \\quad \\eta = \\frac{\\theta}{K}\n$$\nThe parameter $\\epsilon$ is the ratio of the characteristic timescale of immune effector turnover ($1/\\delta$) to the characteristic timescale of pathogen growth ($1/r$). It directly quantifies the separation of timescales. The parameter $\\kappa$ represents the dimensionless killing efficacy of the immune response relative to pathogen growth. The parameter $\\eta$ is the dimensionless half-saturation constant for immune recruitment.\n\nThe small parameter that controls the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) for the immune effector dynamics is $\\epsilon = r/\\delta$. The QSSA is valid when the immune response is much faster than the pathogen dynamics, which corresponds to the condition $\\epsilon \\ll 1$.\n\nTo justify which terms are negligible under the QSSA, we consider the dynamics on the slow timescale, where $\\tau$ is of order unity ($O(1)$). On this timescale, we assume that the system's behavior is regular, meaning that $p(\\tau)$, $i(\\tau)$, and their derivatives ($dp/d\\tau$, $di/d\\tau$) are all of order unity. In the dimensionless equation for the immune effector, $\\epsilon \\frac{di}{d\\tau} = \\frac{p}{p+\\eta} - i$, the terms on the right-hand side are of order unity. If $\\epsilon \\ll 1$, then the term on the left-hand side, $\\epsilon \\frac{di}{d\\tau}$, is of order $\\epsilon$, which is much smaller than the other terms. Therefore, on the slow timescale of pathogen growth, the term $\\epsilon \\frac{di}{d\\tau}$ is negligible. Setting this term to zero yields the QSSA relationship:\n$$\ni(\\tau) \\approx \\frac{p(\\tau)}{p(\\tau)+\\eta}\n$$\nThis algebraic equation states that the immune effector concentration instantaneously adjusts to the current pathogen abundance.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of the small dimensionless parameter $\\epsilon$ using the given values:\n$r = 1.2\\ \\mathrm{day}^{-1}$\n$\\delta = 24\\ \\mathrm{day}^{-1}$\n\nThe small parameter controlling the timescale separation is:\n$$\n\\epsilon = \\frac{r}{\\delta} = \\frac{1.2\\ \\mathrm{day}^{-1}}{24\\ \\mathrm{day}^{-1}} = \\frac{1.2}{24} = 0.05\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\epsilon = 0.0500\n$$\nSince $\\epsilon = 0.05 \\ll 1$, the use of a QSSA for the immune effector dynamics is well-justified for this system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0500}$$", "id": "2536464"}, {"introduction": "Beyond deterministic population dynamics, a central challenge in treating infections is the evolution of drug resistance. When a new resistant mutant arises, its initial low numbers mean its survival is a stochastic event, not a certainty. This practice employs a continuous-time birth-death branching process, a foundational tool in mathematical evolution, to quantify the probability that a single resistant pathogen cell establishes a successful lineage in a fluctuating drug environment [@problem_id:2536415].

The probability of fixation, or survival, $P_{fix}$, is therefore $1 - d/b$.\n\nLet $R$ be the baseline per-capita birth rate. The problem states that the baseline per-capita death rate is equal to this, so the baseline death rate is also $R$.\nThe per-capita death rate of the resistant strain, $\\mu$, is constant and therefore must be equal to this baseline rate, so $\\mu = R$.\n\nThe per-capita birth rate of the resistant strain depends on the presence of the drug.\nIn the absence of the drug (fraction $1-f$ of the time), the birth rate is $\\lambda_{off} = R(1-c)$.\nIn the presence of the drug (fraction $f$ of the time), the birth rate is $\\lambda_{on} = R(1+s)$.\n\nThe key assumption is that the environment switches rapidly relative to demographic events (births and deaths).
