Assume the following biophysical and biochemical conditions grounded in first principles:\n\n- The extracellular concentration of a limiting nutrient is maintained at a saturating level so that membrane transport is operating at its maximal turnover. Membrane transporters are uniformly distributed with areal density $\\rho_{t}$, and each transporter has a maximal catalytic turnover $k_{cat}$ (molecules per unit time per transporter). The cell’s metabolic demand for that nutrient is proportional to its cytoplasmic volume with a volumetric rate $q$ (molecules per unit time per unit volume), which remains constant across sizes.\n\n- Metabolic heat production is proportional to volume with a volumetric power density $p$ (power per unit volume), which remains constant across sizes.

It is well-posed, with all necessary constants and relationships defined to permit a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and formalizable within the principles of geometry and biophysics. It is not trivial, as it requires correct application of these principles to derive the consequences of a change in scale.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous derivation will now be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of a common fold-change factor for two critical biophysical ratios when a spherical cell's diameter doubles. The core of this problem lies in understanding how the surface-area-to-volume ratio scales with size.\n\nFirst, we establish the geometric properties of a sphere of diameter $D$. The surface area, $A$, is given by:\n$$ A = \\pi D^2 $$\nThe volume, $V$, is given by:\n$$ V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{D}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\frac{D^3}{8} = \\frac{1}{6}\\pi D^3 $$\nThe surface-area-to-volume ratio, $\\frac{A}{V}$, is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{A}{V} = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{\\frac{1}{6}\\pi D^3} = \\frac{6}{D} $$\nThis fundamental relationship shows that the surface-area-to-volume ratio is inversely proportional to the diameter.\n\nNow, we evaluate how this ratio changes as the diameter increases from an initial value $d_{initial} = d$ to a final value $d_{final} = 2d$.\nThe initial ratio is:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right)_{initial} = \\frac{6}{d_{initial}} = \\frac{6}{d} $$\nThe final ratio is:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right)_{final} = \\frac{6}{d_{final}} = \\frac{6}{2d} = \\frac{3}{d} $$\nThe fold-change of the surface-area-to-volume ratio is the final value divided by the initial value:\n$$ \\text{Fold-change}\\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right) = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right)_{final}}{\\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right)_{initial}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{d}}{\\frac{6}{d}} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nDoubling the diameter halves the surface-area-to-volume ratio. This is the central scaling law upon which the rest of the analysis depends.\n\nNext, we analyze the two specific ratios given in the problem statement.\n\n1. The ratio of maximal nutrient uptake capacity to metabolic demand.\nThe maximal nutrient uptake capacity is the product of the number of transporters and their maximal turnover rate. The number of transporters is the surface area $A$ multiplied by the areal density $\\rho_{t}$. Thus, uptake capacity is $k_{cat} (\\rho_{t} A)$. The metabolic demand is the volume $V$ multiplied by the volumetric demand rate $q$. Thus, demand is $qV$.\nThe ratio, which we shall call $R_{nutrient}$, is:\n$$ R_{nutrient} = \\frac{k_{cat}\\,\\rho_{t}\\,A}{q\\,V} $$\nThe problem states that $k_{cat}$, $\\rho_{t}$, and $q$ are constants. We can group them into a single constant factor $C_{1} = \\frac{k_{cat}\\,\\rho_{t}}{q}$. The ratio can then be expressed as:\n$$ R_{nutrient} = C_{1} \\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right) $$\nThis shows that the ratio of nutrient supply capacity to demand is directly proportional to the surface-area-to-volume ratio.\n\n2. The ratio of heat dissipation capacity to metabolic heat production.\nThe heat dissipation capacity (per unit temperature difference) is the product of the surface area $A$ and the heat transfer coefficient $h$. Thus, dissipation capacity is $hA$. The metabolic heat production is the product of the volume $V$ and the volumetric power density $p$. Thus, heat production is $pV$.\nThe ratio, which we shall call $R_{heat}$, is:\n$$ R_{heat} = \\frac{h\\,A}{p\\,V} $$\nThe problem states that $h$ and $p$ are constants. We can group them into a single constant factor $C_{2} = \\frac{h}{p}$. The ratio can be expressed as:\n$$ R_{heat} = C_{2} \\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right) $$\nThis shows that the ratio of heat dissipation capacity to production is also directly proportional to the surface-area-to-volume ratio.\n\nSince both $R_{nutrient}$ and $R_{heat}$ are directly proportional to the surface-area-to-volume ratio $\\frac{A}{V}$, their fold-change upon doubling the diameter must be identical to the fold-change of $\\frac{A}{V}$ itself.\nThe fold-change for any quantity $X$ is defined as $\\frac{X_{final}}{X_{initial}}$.\nFor $R_{nutrient}$:\n$$ \\frac{(R_{nutrient})_{final}}{(R_{nutrient})_{initial}} = \\frac{C_{1} \\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right)_{final}}{C_{1} \\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right)_{initial}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right)_{final}}{\\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right)_{initial}} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nFor $R_{heat}$:\n$$ \\frac{(R_{heat})_{final}}{(R_{heat})_{initial}} = \\frac{C_{2} \\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right)_{final}}{C_{2} \\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right)_{initial}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right)_{final}}{\\left(\\frac{A}{V}\\right)_{initial}} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThus, the common fold-change factor that applies to both ratios is $\\frac{1}{2}$. This result quantifies the fundamental constraint that as a cell grows, its surface area (which governs transport and exchange with the environment) does not increase as rapidly as its volume (which governs metabolic needs and heat production).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "2938045"}, {"introduction": "A defining feature of nearly all living cells is the maintenance of an electrical potential across their plasma membrane, a state far from thermodynamic equilibrium.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We will proceed to derive the membrane potential, $V_m$, starting from the Nernst-Planck equation for electrodiffusion.\n\nThe Nernst-Planck equation describes the flux of an ionic species $i$, denoted by $J_i$, under the influence of both a concentration gradient and an electric field. In one dimension, this is given by:\n$$ J_i(x) = -D_i \\left( \\frac{dC_i(x)}{dx} + \\frac{z_i F}{RT} C_i(x) \\frac{d\\phi(x)}{dx} \\right) $$\nHere, $D_i$ is the diffusion coefficient of ion $i$ within the membrane, $C_i(x)$ is its concentration at position $x$, $z_i$ is its valence, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $\\phi(x)$ is the electric potential.\n\nThe problem states to use the constant-field approximation.

The potential difference across the membrane is $V_m = V_{\\text{in}} - V_{\\text{out}} = \\phi(L) - \\phi(0)$.

This yields a simple expression for $S$:\n$$S = \\gamma_{AA} - \\gamma_{BB}$$\nUsing the given numerical values, $\\gamma_{AA} = 1$ and $\\gamma_{BB} = 2$:\n$$S = 1 - 2 = -1$$\n\nFinally, we determine the equilibrium configuration predicted by the energy-minimization principle. The favored configuration is the one with the lower total interfacial free energy. The sign of $S$ tells us the sign of the energy difference. Since $S = -1 < 0$ and $A_{\\text{ext}} > 0$:\n$$E_{B\\text{-in-}A} - E_{A\\text{-in-}B} = S \\cdot A_{\\text{ext}} < 0$$\nThis inequality implies that $E_{B\\text{-in-}A} < E_{A\\text{-in-}B}$.\nTherefore, the B-inside-A configuration (B core, A shell) is energetically more favorable. The DAH predicts that the system will evolve to this state at equilibrium. This result is consistent with the general rule derived from DAH: the cell type with the lower surface tension (type A, as $\\gamma_{AA} < \\gamma_{BB}$) will tend to engulf the cell type with the higher surface tension (type B) to minimize the energy of the high-tension external interface.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1}$$", "id": "2938023"}]}
