At each position, the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase misincorporates a nucleotide with marginal probability $\\epsilon_{\\text{pol}} = 10^{-5}$. Conditional on a misincorporation event having occurred at the $3'$-terminus, the exonuclease proofreading mechanism attempts to remove the mismatch; the conditional probability that proofreading fails to correct the mismatch is $\\epsilon_{\\text{proof}} = 10^{-2}$. Conditional on a post-replicative mismatch persisting, the mismatch repair (MMR) system attempts to correct it; the conditional probability that mismatch repair fails is $\\epsilon_{\\text{MMR}} = 10^{-1}$. Assume independence of error events across positions and conditional independence of correction failures given the presence of a mismatch. A base substitution becomes a fixed mutation only if a misincorporation occurs and both correction systems fail before the next replication cycle.\n\nWithin the framework of the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, where high-fidelity replication preserves information flow from DNA to DNA, use only the definitions above and first principles of probability and expectation to derive an expression for the expected number of replication-induced base substitutions per cell division across the $3.2 \\times 10^{9}$ positions. Then evaluate this expectation numerically using the given parameter values. Report the final number of substitutions per division as an exact number (no rounding, no units).\n\nFinally, based on your result and established qualitative knowledge of replication fidelity in normal human somatic cells with intact proofreading and mismatch repair, briefly assess in words whether the magnitude you computed is biologically plausible, and justify your reasoning qualitatively (your qualitative assessment will not affect the numerical answer requirement).", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the expected number of base substitutions that become fixed in a genome after one cycle of replication. This quantity is determined by the interplay of error introduction by DNA polymerase and subsequent correction by two major repair systems: proofreading and mismatch repair. The foundation of the solution lies in probability theory, specifically the calculation of the probability of a sequence of dependent events, and the application of the linearity of expectation.\n\nLet $N$ be the total number of nucleotide positions in the genome, which is given as $N = 3.2 \\times 10^{9}$.\nA base substitution becomes a fixed mutation at a single position if and only if a sequence of three events occurs: an initial misincorporation, a failure of proofreading, and a subsequent failure of mismatch repair. We must calculate the probability of this compound event.\n\nLet us define the events for a single nucleotide position:\n- $M$: The event that DNA polymerase misincorporates a nucleotide. The probability is given as $P(M) = \\epsilon_{\\text{pol}} = 10^{-5}$.\n- $F_P$: The event that the exonuclease proofreading mechanism fails to correct the mismatch. This is a conditional event, dependent on the occurrence of a misincorporation. The problem provides the conditional probability $P(F_P | M) = \\epsilon_{\\text{proof}} = 10^{-2}$.\n- $F_{MMR}$: The event that the mismatch repair (MMR) system fails to correct the mismatch. This event is conditional on a mismatch having persisted through both replication and proofreading, i.e., conditional on the event $M \\cap F_P$. The problem provides the conditional probability $P(F_{MMR} | M \\cap F_P) = \\epsilon_{\\text{MMR}} = 10^{-1}$.\n\nThe probability of a single fixed substitution, which we denote as $\\mu$, is the probability of the intersection of these three events: $\\mu = P(M \\cap F_P \\cap F_{MMR})$. Using the chain rule for probabilities, we can express $\\mu$ as follows:\n$$ \\mu = P(M) \\times P(F_P | M) \\times P(F_{MMR} | M \\cap F_P) $$\nThe problem statement provides all the necessary probabilities on the right-hand side. Substituting the given symbolic parameters:\n$$ \\mu = \\epsilon_{\\text{pol}} \\cdot \\epsilon_{\\text{proof}} \\cdot \\epsilon_{\\text{MMR}} $$\nThis expression represents the probability of a fixed mutation arising at any single nucleotide position during one cell division.\n\nNow, we must find the expected total number of such mutations across the entire genome of $N$ positions. Let $X$ be a random variable representing the total number of substitutions per cell division. We can define $N$ indicator random variables, $X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_N$, where $X_i = 1$ if a fixed substitution occurs at position $i$, and $X_i = 0$ otherwise. The probability that $X_i = 1$ is precisely $\\mu$, as calculated above.\nThe total number of substitutions is the sum of these indicator variables: $X = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$.\n\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected value of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expected values:\n$$ E[X] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i] $$\nThe expectation of an indicator variable $X_i$ is equal to the probability of the event it indicates: $E[X_i] = 1 \\cdot P(X_i=1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_i=0) = P(X_i=1) = \\mu$.\nSince the probability of mutation $\\mu$ is assumed to be identical for all positions, the sum simplifies to:\n$$ E[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mu = N \\cdot \\mu $$\nThus, the final expression for the expected number of substitutions is:\n$$ E[X] = N \\cdot \\epsilon_{\\text{pol}} \\cdot \\epsilon_{\\text{proof}} \\cdot \\epsilon_{\\text{MMR}} $$\nWe now proceed to the numerical evaluation using the given parameter values:\n$N = 3.2 \\times 10^{9}$\n$\\epsilon_{\\text{pol}} = 10^{-5}$\n$\\epsilon_{\\text{proof}} = 10^{-2}$\n$\\epsilon_{\\text{MMR}} = 10^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the single-site mutation probability, $\\mu$:\n$$ \\mu = (10^{-5}) \\times (10^{-2}) \\times (10^{-1}) = 10^{-5-2-1} = 10^{-8} $$\nThis is the per-site, per-replication mutation rate.\n\nNext, we calculate the expected total number of substitutions, $E[X]$:\n$$ E[X] = (3.2 \\times 10^{9}) \\times (10^{-8}) = 3.2 \\times 10^{9-8} = 3.2 \\times 10^{1} = 32 $$\nThe expected number of replication-induced base substitutions per cell division is therefore $32$.\n\nFinally, we assess the biological plausibility of this result. The calculated overall mutation rate of $\\mu = 10^{-8}$ mutations per base pair per replication cycle is a textbook value, highly consistent with measurements of the germline mutation rate in humans and other mammals. The resulting expectation of $32$ new mutations for a genome of size $3.2 \\times 10^{9}$ base pairs is also well within the range of established biological estimates. Empirical studies of *de novo* mutations in humans, which accumulate over cell divisions, report tens of new mutations per generation. An expectation of $32$ mutations arising from a single round of replication of the genome is therefore a scientifically sound and plausible magnitude. It correctly quantifies the outcome of a process where an immense number of nucleotides are copied with extraordinarily high, yet imperfect, fidelity.

Using only foundational definitions from the central dogma and macromolecular enzymology, derive from first principles an exact expression for the total number of high-energy phosphate equivalents consumed by this single round, under the following explicit assumptions that reflect well-established biochemical steps:\n\n- Aminoacylation (charging) of transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases consumes adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) plus inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), which corresponds to 2 high-energy phosphate equivalents per amino acid charged.\n- Translational elongation on the ribosome consumes guanosine triphosphate (GTP) for each elongation cycle: 1 GTP for aminoacyl-tRNA delivery and 1 GTP for translocation per peptide bond formed, for a total of 2 GTP per peptide bond.

It provides a set of clear, explicit assumptions and sufficient data to derive a unique, exact solution from first principles of molecular biology and biochemistry. The problem reduces to a straightforward calculation based on the provided bioenergetic costs for transcription and translation. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe total number of high-energy phosphate equivalents consumed, which we will denote as $E_{total}$, is the sum of the energy consumed during transcription ($E_{transcription}$) and translation ($E_{translation}$).\n$$E_{total} = E_{transcription} + E_{translation}$$\n\nFirst, we will calculate the energy cost of transcription.\nThe synthesis of a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) molecule of length $m$ nucleotides requires the formation of $m-1$ phosphodiester bonds. The problem specifies that the length of the mRNA is $m = 3000$ nucleotides. Therefore, the number of phosphodiester bonds formed is $3000 - 1 = 2999$.\nAccording to the provided assumptions, the formation of each phosphodiester bond consumes 2 high-energy phosphate equivalents. This accounts for the cleavage of a nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) to a nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), followed by the hydrolysis of PPi.\nThe total energy cost for transcription is therefore:\n$$E_{transcription} = (m-1) \\times 2$$\nSubstituting the value $m=3000$:\n$$E_{transcription} = (3000 - 1) \\times 2 = 2999 \\times 2 = 5998$$\n\nNext, we calculate the energy cost of translation, $E_{translation}$. This process, under the given constraints, consists of two distinct energetic costs: the charging of transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules (aminoacylation), and the elongation of the polypeptide chain on the ribosome.\n$$E_{translation} = E_{aminoacylation} + E_{elongation}$$\n\nThe cost of aminoacylation, $E_{aminoacylation}$, is the energy required to attach each amino acid to its corresponding tRNA. The protein to be synthesized has a length of $n = 1000$ amino acids. Each of these 1000 amino acids must be \"charged\" or activated. The problem states that charging one tRNA molecule consumes ATP, yielding AMP and PPi, which is equivalent to the hydrolysis of two phosphoanhydride bonds, or 2 high-energy phosphate equivalents per amino acid.\nThe total cost for aminoacylation is:\n$$E_{aminoacylation} = n \\times 2$$\nSubstituting the value $n=1000$:\n$$E_{aminoacylation} = 1000 \\times 2 = 2000$$\n\nThe cost of elongation, $E_{elongation}$, is associated with the formation of peptide bonds. A protein of length $n$ amino acids contains $n-1$ peptide bonds. For a protein of 1000 amino acids, this is $1000 - 1 = 999$ peptide bonds.\nThe problem states that each elongation cycle, which forms one peptide bond, consumes 2 molecules of GTP. One GTP is used for the delivery of the aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site of the ribosome, and a second GTP is used for the translocation of the ribosome along the mRNA. Each GTP hydrolyzed to GDP is counted as 1 high-energy phosphate equivalent. Thus, the formation of one peptide bond costs 2 high-energy phosphate equivalents.\nThe total cost for elongation is:\n$$E_{elongation} = (n-1) \\times 2$$\nSubstituting the value $n=1000$:\n$$E_{elongation} = (1000 - 1) \\times 2 = 999 \\times 2 = 1998$$\n\nFinally, we sum these individual costs to find the total energy consumption for this single round of gene expression.\n$$E_{total} = E_{transcription} + E_{aminoacylation} + E_{elongation}$$\n$$E_{total} = 5998 + 2000 + 1998$$\n$$E_{total} = 7998 + 1998 = 9996$$\n\nAlternatively, we can construct a general formula from the symbolic expressions:\n$$E_{total} = 2(m-1) + 2n + 2(n-1)$$\n$$E_{total} = 2m - 2 + 2n + 2n - 2$$\n$$E_{total} = 2m + 4n - 4$$\nSubstituting the given values $m=3000$ and $n=1000$:\n$$E_{total} = 2(3000) + 4(1000) - 4$$\n$$E_{total} = 6000 + 4000 - 4$$\n$$E_{total} = 10000 - 4 = 9996$$\nBoth methods yield the same result.

This problem explores Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD), a sophisticated surveillance pathway that eliminates faulty mRNAs containing premature termination codons. To solve it, you will apply the canonical “50–55 nt rule,” which elegantly links the history of splicing (marked by exon junction complexes) to the act of translation, demonstrating how the cell integrates information from different stages of gene expression to maintain proteome integrity [@problem_id:2842262].", "problem": "A human pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) is transcribed and spliced to yield a mature messenger RNA (mRNA) with canonical exon–exon junctions.

NMD outcome depends exclusively on poly(A) tail length via poly(A)-binding protein; sufficiently long tails universally prevent decay irrespective of PTC–junction geometry.", "solution": "**Derivation of Solution**\nThe central question is whether an mRNA with a premature termination codon (PTC) located $60$ nucleotides upstream of the final exon-exon junction will be targeted for degradation by the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway. The analysis must proceed from the fundamental principles of post-transcriptional gene regulation.\n\n1.  **Splicing and EJC Deposition**: During splicing in the nucleus, introns are removed and exons are ligated. Concurrently, a multi-protein complex known as the exon junction complex (EJC) is deposited on the mRNA sequence, typically $20$–$24$ nucleotides upstream of the newly formed exon-exon junction. These EJCs serve as markers of the splicing history of the mRNA.\n\n2.  **mRNA Export and Pioneer Translation**: The mature mRNA, along with its associated EJCs, is exported to the cytoplasm. The first round of translation by a ribosome is termed the \"pioneer round.\" As the ribosome translocates along the mRNA, it displaces and removes the EJCs it encounters.\n\n3.  **NMD Surveillance**: NMD is a quality control mechanism that identifies and degrades mRNAs containing PTCs. The canonical trigger for NMD in vertebrates is the detection of an EJC downstream of a terminating ribosome. Normal termination codons (TCs) are typically located in the last exon, downstream of the final exon-exon junction. Consequently, no EJCs are present downstream of a normal TC, and the mRNA is stable. A PTC, by definition, occurs upstream of the normal TC. If a PTC's position allows a ribosome to terminate while at least one EJC remains on the mRNA downstream, this configuration is recognized as aberrant.\n\n4.  **The \"$50$–$55$ nt Rule\"**: This empirical rule provides a quantitative criterion for NMD activation. It states that a termination codon located more than $50$–$55$ nt upstream of an exon-exon junction will trigger NMD. A termination codon located within this $50$–$55$ nt region will not. The mechanistic basis for this rule relates to the physical size, or \"footprint,\" of the terminating ribosome. When a ribosome terminates, it does not immediately dissociate but occupies a segment of the mRNA. If the stop codon is too close to the downstream EJC (i.e., within the $50$–$55$ nt boundary from the junction), the terminating ribosome's footprint sterically displaces the EJC. If the stop codon is sufficiently far upstream (i.e., > $50$–$55$ nt), the ribosome terminates and dissociates without disturbing the downstream EJC.\n\n5.  **Application to the Problem**:\n    - The PTC is located $60$ nt upstream of the last exon-exon junction.\n    - The distance $d = 60$ nt.\n    - The critical distance for the \"$50$–$55$ nt rule\" is $d_{crit} \\approx 50-55$ nt.\n    - Since $d > d_{crit}$ ($60 \\text{ nt} > 55 \\text{ nt}$), the condition for NMD activation is met.\n    - **Mechanism**: The ribosome will translate the mRNA and encounter the PTC. Upon termination, the ribosome will be positioned sufficiently far from the downstream EJC (which is located $20$–$24$ nt upstream of the junction) so that it does not displace it. The presence of this surviving EJC downstream of the stalled ribosome recruits a set of proteins central to NMD, known as the Up-Frameshift (UPF) factors. Specifically, UPF3B is a core component of the EJC, which then recruits UPF2. Meanwhile, the terminating ribosome recruits UPF1. The interaction between UPF1 at the PTC and the UPF2/UPF3B complex at the EJC forms a surveillance complex that signals for the mRNA to be degraded.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. NMD will be triggered during the pioneer round of translation in the cytoplasm because the PTC lies more than $50$–$55$ nt upstream of the last exon–exon junction, ensuring at least one downstream EJC remains to recruit Up-Frameshift proteins (UPF1/UPF2/UPF3) and license decay.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with the derivation. The PTC at $60$ nt upstream satisfies the >$50$–$55$ nt rule. The mechanistic consequence is the persistence of the downstream EJC. This EJC, in concert with the terminated ribosome, recruits the UPF proteins to form the complex that triggers decay.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. NMD will not be triggered because EJCs are removed during nuclear splicing, so no downstream EJC can be present when the ribosome terminates at the PTC.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. EJCs are deposited, not removed, during splicing. They are transported to the cytoplasm with the mRNA and removed by the translating ribosome. The premise of the argument is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. NMD will not be triggered because a ribosome terminating at a PTC $60$ nt upstream of the last junction will displace the downstream EJC with its termination footprint, preventing formation of the surveillance complex.**\nThis statement directly contradicts the mechanistic interpretation of the \"$50$–$55$ nt rule.\" A distance of $60$ nt is greater than the critical threshold, and is thus predicted to be *too far* for the ribosome to displace the EJC. This option claims the opposite, suggesting displacement will occur, which is incorrect according to the standard model invoked by the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. NMD requires at least two downstream EJCs to be engaged; with only one exon–exon junction downstream of the PTC, decay will not occur.**\nThis premise is false. The canonical NMD model requires only *one* downstream EJC to trigger decay. The \"$50$–$55$ nt rule\" is defined relative to a single junction (the last one, when applicable), reinforcing that a single EJC is sufficient.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. NMD outcome depends exclusively on poly(A) tail length via poly(A)-binding protein; sufficiently long tails universally prevent decay irrespective of PTC–junction geometry.**\nThis statement is a gross oversimplification and is factually incorrect. While interactions involving the poly(A) tail and Poly(A)-Binding Protein (PABP) are important for normal translation termination and can modulate NMD efficiency, they do not act \"exclusively\" or \"irrespective\" of the PTC-EJC context. The primary signal for NMD is the presence of a downstream EJC. The claim that PTC-junction geometry is irrelevant is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2842262"}]}
