While Mendel's foundational laws predict precise progeny ratios, factors like embryonic lethality can systematically alter these outcomes. This exercise explores the concept of a recessive lethal allele, where a specific homozygous genotype is not viable, requiring a re-evaluation of expected phenotypic ratios among survivors. By working through this problem, you will practice adjusting Mendelian predictions to account for viability selection, a fundamental concept in population and evolutionary genetics [@problem_id:2953576].", "problem": "A single autosomal locus with alleles $A$ and $a$ controls a visible trait such that $A$ is completely dominant to $a$ for the trait. However, individuals with genotype $AA$ are inviable due to embryonic lethality, whereas individuals with genotypes $Aa$ and $aa$ are viable and have equal viability. Two heterozygous parents are crossed: $Aa \\times Aa$. Starting from Mendel’s law of segregation (each heterozygote produces $A$ and $a$ gametes with probability $1/2$) and the definition of viability selection (only $AA$ have viability $0$, while $Aa$ and $aa$ have viability $1$), derive the expected zygotic genotype frequencies prior to selection.

It describes a classic scenario of a recessive lethal allele. The allele $A$ is pleiotropic: it determines a dominant visible trait and, when homozygous ($AA$), causes lethality. This is a well-documented phenomenon in genetics and is not contradictory. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information: the parental genotypes, the inheritance pattern, the specific mechanism of selection (lethality), and the probabilities of gamete formation. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any criteria for invalidity. It is a standard, formalizable problem in population genetics.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in a logical sequence as requested. First, we determine the expected genotypic frequencies in the zygotes immediately after fertilization, before any selection has occurred. The cross is $Aa \\times Aa$. Each parent produces two types of gametes, $A$ and $a$, each with a probability of $P(A) = 1/2$ and $P(a) = 1/2$. The formation of zygotes is the result of random fusion of these gametes. The probabilities of the resulting zygotic genotypes are calculated as follows:\n- The probability of genotype $AA$ is $P(AA) = P(A \\text{ from parent 1}) \\times P(A \\text{ from parent 2}) = (1/2) \\times (1/2) = 1/4$.\n- The probability of genotype $Aa$ is $P(Aa) = [P(A \\text{ from parent 1}) \\times P(a \\text{ from parent 2})] + [P(a \\text{ from parent 1}) \\times P(A \\text{ from parent 2})] = [(1/2) \\times (1/2)] + [(1/2) \\times (1/2)] = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2$.\n- The probability of genotype $aa$ is $P(aa) = P(a \\text{ from parent 1}) \\times P(a \\text{ from parent 2}) = (1/2) \\times (1/2) = 1/4$.\n\nThus, the expected zygotic genotype frequencies prior to selection are $P(AA) = 1/4$, $P(Aa) = 1/2$, and $P(aa) = 1/4$. The sum of these frequencies is $1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1$, as expected.\n\nNext, we impose the viability constraint specified in the problem. The viability of genotype $AA$ is $w_{AA} = 0$, while the viabilities of genotypes $Aa$ and $aa$ are $w_{Aa} = 1$ and $w_{aa} = 1$, respectively. The frequency of each genotype class after selection is proportional to its initial frequency multiplied by its relative viability.\n- The post-selection frequency of $AA$ is $P(AA) \\times w_{AA} = (1/4) \\times 0 = 0$.\n- The post-selection frequency of $Aa$ is $P(Aa) \\times w_{Aa} = (1/2) \\times 1 = 1/2$.\n- The post-selection frequency of $aa$ is $P(aa) \\times w_{aa} = (1/4) \\times 1 = 1/4$.\n\nThese are the proportions of the original zygotic pool that survive. The total proportion of surviving offspring is the sum of these post-selection frequencies:\n$$ \\text{Total survival proportion} = 0 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4} $$\nThe initial population of zygotes is reduced to $3/4$ of its original size.\n\nTo find the expected frequencies among the live offspring, we must renormalize the surviving classes by dividing their post-selection frequencies by the total survival proportion.\n- The frequency of genotype $Aa$ among surviving progeny is $P'(Aa) = \\frac{P(Aa) \\times w_{Aa}}{\\text{Total survival proportion}} = \\frac{1/2}{3/4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n- The frequency of genotype $aa$ among surviving progeny is $P'(aa) = \\frac{P(aa) \\times w_{aa}}{\\text{Total survival proportion}} = \\frac{1/4}{3/4} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe sum of these renormalized frequencies is $2/3 + 1/3 = 1$, which confirms the normalization is correct. The expected genotypic ratio among live offspring is $2 Aa : 1 aa$.\n\nFinally, we must determine the phenotypic composition of the surviving progeny. The problem states that allele $A$ is completely dominant to allele $a$.\n- Individuals with genotype $Aa$ will exhibit the dominant phenotype.\n- Individuals with genotype $aa$ will exhibit the recessive phenotype.\nThe genotype $AA$, which would also have shown the dominant phenotype, does not survive.\n\nThe question asks for the proportion of surviving progeny that exhibit the dominant phenotype. This corresponds to the frequency of the $Aa$ genotype among the survivors.\n- Proportion with dominant phenotype = $P'(Aa) = 2/3$.\n- Proportion with recessive phenotype = $P'(aa) = 1/3$.\n\nThe proportion of surviving progeny exhibiting the dominant phenotype is therefore $2/3$. This is a reduced fraction as requested.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$$", "id": "2953576"}, {"introduction": "The complexity of inheritance often extends beyond simple dominant-recessive relationships. Many genes feature multiple alleles within a population, which can interact in intricate ways.

The terminology is standard and unambiguous within the field of genetics. No scientific, logical, or factual flaws are detected. The problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first establishing the genotype-phenotype map for the ABO system and then applying the Law of Segregation to the specified parental cross.\n\n**Dominance and Codominance Relationships**\nThe three alleles $I^A$, $I^B$, and $i$ combine to form six possible diploid genotypes: $I^A I^A$, $I^A I^B$, $I^A i$, $I^B I^B$, $I^B i$, and $ii$. The relationships that map these genotypes to the four observed phenotypes (A, B, AB, O) are as follows:\n- The alleles $I^A$ and $I^B$ are **codominant**. When an individual has the genotype $I^A I^B$, both alleles are expressed, resulting in the AB phenotype.\n- The alleles $I^A$ and $I^B$ are each completely **dominant** over the allele $i$. This means that the genotype $I^A i$ results in the A phenotype, and the genotype $I^B i$ results in the B phenotype.\n- The allele $i$ is **recessive** to both $I^A$ and $I^B$. The O phenotype is observed only in individuals with the homozygous recessive genotype $ii$.\n\nIn summary:\n- Phenotype A: Genotypes $I^A I^A$ or $I^A i$.\n- Phenotype B: Genotypes $I^B I^B$ or $I^B i$.\n- Phenotype AB: Genotype $I^A I^B$.\n- Phenotype O: Genotype $ii$.\n\n**Derivation of Offspring Distribution for the Cross $I^A i \\times I^B i$**\nWe analyze the cross between a parent with genotype $I^A i$ and a parent with genotype $I^B i$.\n\nAccording to the Law of Segregation, during gamete formation, the two alleles at a locus separate so that each gamete receives only one of them. The probability of a gamete receiving either allele is equal.\n- The parent with genotype $I^A i$ produces two types of gametes, $I^A$ and $i$, each with a probability of $P(\\text{gamete } I^A) = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $P(\\text{gamete } i) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- The parent with genotype $I^B i$ produces two types of gametes, $I^B$ and $i$, each with a probability of $P(\\text{gamete } I^B) = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $P(\\text{gamete } i) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe genotypes of the offspring are determined by the random union of these gametes.
