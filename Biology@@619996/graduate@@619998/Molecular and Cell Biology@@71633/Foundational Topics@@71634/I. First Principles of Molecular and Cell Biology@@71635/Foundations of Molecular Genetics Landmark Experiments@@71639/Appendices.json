All premises, such as linear transfer and constant velocity, are standard idealizations for this type of analysis. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides a complete and consistent set of data. The number of givens is sufficient to deduce a unique location for the origin of transfer, $oriT$. No essential information is missing, and there are no contradictions in the data.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unambiguous language. It is free from subjective claims or opinions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action.**\nThe problem is deemed valid and well-posed. A rigorous solution will be developed.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe solution is derived through a systematic analysis of the provided experimental data.\n\n**1. Determination of Marker Entry Order and Relative Distances.**\nThe order of gene transfer is directly determined by sorting the markers according to their experimental time of entry. This yields the linear sequence:\n$lac$ ($1$ min) $\\rightarrow$ $gal$ ($8$ min) $\\rightarrow$ $arg$ ($23$ min) $\\rightarrow$ $met$ ($34$ min) $\\rightarrow$ $xyl$ ($45$ min) $\\rightarrow$ $purE$ ($55$ min) $\\rightarrow$ $leu$ ($66$ min) $\\rightarrow$ $ton$ ($80$ min) $\\rightarrow$ $thi$ ($89$ min).\n\nGiven that the transfer velocity is $1.00$ map minute per real minute, the time elapsed between the entry of any two successive markers is numerically equal to the map distance separating them along the chromosome segment being transferred. The relative distances between adjacent markers are calculated as follows:\n- $d(lac, gal) = 8 - 1 = 7$ minutes\n- $d(gal, arg) = 23 - 8 = 15$ minutes\n- $d(arg, met) = 34 - 23 = 11$ minutes\n- $d(met, xyl) = 45 - 34 = 11$ minutes\n- $d(xyl, purE) = 55 - 45 = 10$ minutes\n- $d(purE, leu) = 66 - 55 = 11$ minutes\n- $d(leu, ton) = 80 - 66 = 14$ minutes\n- $d(ton, thi) = 89 - 80 = 9$ minutes\n\n**2. Inference of Transfer Direction.**\nThe direction of DNA transfer is inferred by comparing the experimentally determined gene order with the known absolute positions of these genes on the $0-100$ minute circular reference map.\n- Experimental Order: $lac \\rightarrow gal \\rightarrow arg \\rightarrow met \\rightarrow xyl \\rightarrow purE \\rightarrow leu \\rightarrow ton \\rightarrow thi$\n- Absolute Positions: $60 \\rightarrow 67 \\rightarrow 82 \\rightarrow 93 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 14 \\rightarrow 25 \\rightarrow 39 \\rightarrow 48$\n\nThe progression of map coordinates from $P_{lac}=60$ to $P_{met}=93$ is strictly increasing. The subsequent transfer from $met$ (position $93$) to $xyl$ (position $4$) indicates that the transfer process has crossed the $100/0$ minute boundary of the map. From $xyl$ onwards, the coordinates again increase sequentially. This monotonic increase in map coordinates (modulo $100$) establishes the direction of transfer as **clockwise**.\n\nTo confirm this conclusion, the map distances calculated from the absolute positions must match the time differences from the experiment. For a clockwise transfer:\n- $P_{gal} - P_{lac} = 67 - 60 = 7$. This matches the observed time interval.\n- $P_{arg} - P_{gal} = 82 - 67 = 15$. This matches.\n- $P_{met} - P_{arg} = 93 - 82 = 11$. This matches.\n- $d(met, xyl) = (100 - P_{met}) + P_{xyl} = (100 - 93) + 4 = 11$. This matches.\n- $P_{purE} - P_{xyl} = 14 - 4 = 10$. This matches.\n- The remaining distances consistently align. The data shows perfect internal consistency.\n\n**3. Computation of the $oriT$ Coordinate.**\nThe origin of transfer, $oriT$, is the starting point of DNA transfer. According to the problem statement, the entry time of the first marker is equal to the map distance from $oriT$ to that marker.\n- First marker to enter: $lac$.\n- Absolute position of $lac$: $P_{lac} = 60$ minutes.\n- Time of entry of $lac$: $t_{lac} = 1$ minute.\n- Thus, the distance from $oriT$ to $lac$ is $d(oriT, lac) = 1$ map minute.\n\nSince the transfer is clockwise, $oriT$ must be located upstream of the $lac$ gene, which corresponds to a numerically smaller coordinate on the map. The position of $oriT$ is therefore calculated by subtracting the distance from the position of $lac$.\n$$P_{oriT} = P_{lac} - d(oriT, lac)$$\n$$P_{oriT} = 60 - 1 = 59 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\nWe verify this position with another marker, for instance $arg$. The time of entry for $arg$ is $23$ minutes. The clockwise distance from $P_{oriT}=59$ to $P_{arg}=82$ is $82 - 59 = 23$ minutes, which matches the observation. The position is confirmed.\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $59$ is written as $59.0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{59.0}$$", "id": "2945694"}, {"introduction": "The discovery of gene regulation by François Jacob and Jacques Monod explained how cells selectively express genes, with their *lac* operon model remaining a cornerstone of molecular biology.

Consider partial diploids formed by an episome known as the fertility factor prime (F$^{\\prime}$) carrying lactose operon alleles. The lactose repressor gene $I$ acts in trans, the operator $O$ and promoter $P$ act in cis, and the lactose structural gene $Z$ encodes $\\beta$-galactosidase. Assume a simple occupancy model for transcription regulation, grounded in the law of mass action and the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology: transcription of each operon occurs at a maximal rate $r_{\\max}$ when its operator is not bound by active repressor, and is fully blocked when bound. For an operator with wild-type sequence $O^{+}$, the probability that the operator is occupied by active repressor is $p_{\\mathrm{bound}}=\\dfrac{R_{a}}{R_{a}+K}$, where $R_{a}$ is the cell-wide concentration of active repressor and $K>0$ is an effective dissociation parameter. For a constitutive operator $O^{c}$, $p_{\\mathrm{bound}}=0$. The promoter allele $P^{-}$ has zero activity and $P^{+}$ has unit activity.

Let each $I^{+}$ or $I^{s}$ allele contribute a concentration $c>0$ of repressor subunits that are active in the absence of inducer. An $I^{-}$ allele contributes $0$. Under saturating inducer: $I^{+}$-derived repressor is fully inactivated, while $I^{s}$ (superrepressor) remains fully active. Hence, in the absence of inducer, $R_{a}=c\\,(n_{+}+n_{s})$, and in the presence of saturating inducer, $R_{a}=c\\,n_{s}$, where $n_{+}$ and $n_{s}$ are the copy numbers of $I^{+}$ and $I^{s}$ alleles, respectively, in the merodiploid.\n\nAnalyze the following three Escherichia coli F$^{\\prime}$ merodiploids, each carrying two lactose operons (one chromosomal and one episomal):\n\n- Strain $\\mathrm{A}$: Chromosome $I^{+}O^{+}P^{+}Z^{+}$; F$^{\\prime}$ $I^{-}O^{c}P^{+}Z^{+}$.\n- Strain $\\mathrm{B}$: Chromosome $I^{-}O^{+}P^{+}Z^{+}$; F$^{\\prime}$ $I^{s}O^{+}P^{+}Z^{+}$.\n- Strain $\\mathrm{C}$: Chromosome $I^{+}O^{+}P^{-}Z^{+}$; F$^{\\prime}$ $I^{+}O^{+}P^{+}Z^{+}$.\n\nUsing only the rules and model stated above, determine for each strain whether the $\\beta$-galactosidase locus is expressed with and without saturating inducer, and compute the corresponding expected synthesis rates by evaluating $r_{j}$ for each operon and summing across the two operons in the same cell.\n\nFinally, define the dimensionless fold-change\n$$\nQ \\equiv \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{ind}}(\\mathrm{A})+R_{\\mathrm{ind}}(\\mathrm{B})+R_{\\mathrm{ind}}(\\mathrm{C})}{R_{\\mathrm{unind}}(\\mathrm{A})+R_{\\mathrm{unind}}(\\mathrm{B})+R_{\\mathrm{unind}}(\\mathrm{C})},\n$$\nwhere $R_{\\mathrm{ind}}(\\cdot)$ and $R_{\\mathrm{unind}}(\\cdot)$ denote the total $\\beta$-galactosidase synthesis rate in the indicated strain in the presence and absence of saturating inducer, respectively.

The first step is initiated by the branchpoint adenosine $2'$-hydroxyl attacking the $5'$ splice site phosphate to form a $2'$–$5'$ phosphodiester lariat linkage; the second step is initiated by the Exon$1$ $3'$-hydroxyl attacking the $3'$ splice site phosphate to ligate exons. Under these conditions, M$1$ yields no lariat at the canonical site and, lacking alternative branchpoints, shows no lariat; M$2$ fails to form a lariat; M$3$ forms and accumulates the lariat–$3'$ exon intermediate but does not ligate exons; M$4$ fails to form a lariat.\n\nC. The first step uses the branchpoint base irrespective of ribose chemistry; thus M$4$ still forms a lariat. The $5'$ splice site can be compensated by use of a cryptic site, so M$2$ still forms a lariat, whereas M$3$ blocks both steps and prevents lariat formation; M$1$ forms a lariat at guanosine.\n\nD. All four mutants retain the capacity to form a lariat, though with reduced efficiency, because transesterification does not require specific bases or hydroxyls as long as the spliceosome assembles.", "solution": "We begin by deriving the two-step splicing mechanism from first principles of phosphodiester chemistry and splice-signal recognition.\n\nTransesterification is a phosphoryl transfer in which a hydroxyl nucleophile ($\\mathrm{ROH}$) attacks the phosphorus of a phosphodiester, forming a new phosphodiester and releasing a leaving group, with no net change in the number of phosphodiester bonds. In a spliceosome, catalytic RNA and proteins position specific hydroxyls relative to target phosphates, and divalent metals stabilize the transition state. For intron excision to occur without net consumption of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the chemical steps, the pathway must be decomposed into two such transesterifications that together sever the intron and ligate exons.\n\nTo excise an intron and preserve exon order, the bond between Exon$1$ and the intron at the $5'$ splice site must be broken first. To conserve phosphodiesters, this cleavage must be coupled to formation of a new phosphodiester to a nucleophile within the intron. The uniquely positioned nucleophile is the branchpoint adenosine $2'$-hydroxyl, which is both chemically reactive and specifically recognized: U2 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) base-pairs with the branchpoint region in a way that bulges the adenosine base, positioning its $2'$-hydroxyl for in-line attack. Thus, in the first chemical step, the branchpoint adenosine $2'$-hydroxyl attacks the phosphate at the $5'$ splice site, cleaving the Exon$1$–intron junction. This yields two products: a free Exon$1$ with a $3'$-hydroxyl, and an intron–Exon$2$ intermediate bearing a lariat linkage in which the branchpoint adenosine is connected to the former $5'$ splice site via an atypical $2'$–$5'$ phosphodiester bond.\n\nIn the second chemical step, the newly generated $3'$-hydroxyl of Exon$1$ acts as the nucleophile that attacks the phosphate at the $3'$ splice site, thereby ligating Exon$1$ to Exon$2$ and releasing the intron lariat. This two-step scheme is consistent with the need to conserve phosphodiester bonds, the identities and positions of available hydroxyl nucleophiles, and the requirement for precise recognition of the $5'$ and $3'$ splice sites and the branchpoint.\n\nWe now predict the effects of the mutations on lariat formation based on these mechanistic and recognition constraints:\n\n- M$1$ (branchpoint adenosine base mutated to guanosine, with no alternative adenosine in the recognition window). Although ribose $2'$-hydroxyl groups are present on all ribonucleotides, the spliceosome specifically recognizes and bulges an adenosine at the branchpoint via U2 snRNA pairing; this adenosine identity is highly conserved in U2-type introns. Substitution to guanosine disrupts U2-mediated bulging and catalytic activation of the $2'$-hydroxyl at that position. In natural contexts, splicing sometimes shifts to a nearby cryptic adenosine in the proper window. Here, by design, there is no alternative adenosine; thus the first transesterification cannot proceed at the canonical site or an alternative site, and no lariat is formed.\n\n- M$2$ ($5'$ splice site $GU$ changed to $AU$ with all other features U2-type). The $5'$ splice site $GU$ dinucleotide is an essential identity element for recognition by U1 snRNA and subsequent assembly steps that position the scissile phosphate. Altering it to $AU$ abrogates recognition by the major (U2-type) spliceosome. Although a minor (U12-type) spliceosome processes AU–AC introns, the rest of the signals here are not compatible (the $3'$ splice site is $AG$, not $AC$, and the surrounding consensus does not match). Therefore, the spliceosome fails to assemble productively at the $5'$ splice site, and the first transesterification does not occur; no lariat forms.\n\n- M$3$ ($3'$ splice site $AG$ changed to $AA$ with intact $5'$ splice site and branchpoint). The first step does not require the $3'$ splice site; it requires only the $5'$ splice site and the branchpoint adenosine $2'$-hydroxyl. Thus, the first transesterification can proceed to generate the lariat–$3'$ exon intermediate. The second step requires a correctly configured $3'$ splice site phosphate as the electrophile; changing $AG$ to $AA$ disrupts recognition by $3'$ splice site factors and proper positioning of the scissile phosphate, blocking exon ligation. The expected outcome is accumulation of the lariat–$3'$ exon intermediate without exon ligation.\n\n- M$4$ (branchpoint adenosine ribose replaced by $2'$-deoxyribose; base identity retained). The first step requires the branchpoint $2'$-hydroxyl as the nucleophile to attack the $5'$ splice site phosphate. Removal of this $2'$-hydroxyl eliminates the required nucleophile even if recognition by U2 snRNA remains otherwise intact. Consequently, the first transesterification cannot occur; no lariat forms.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This option asserts that the first step is initiated by the Exon$1$ $3'$-hydroxyl attacking the $3'$ splice site. That inverts the true sequence of events and misidentifies the nucleophile; the first step targets the $5'$ splice site and uses the branchpoint $2'$-hydroxyl as nucleophile. It further predicts lariats in M$1$ and M$3$, but M$1$ lacks a usable branchpoint adenosine and therefore cannot form a lariat under the stated constraints. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nB. This option correctly states the nucleophiles and electrophiles for the two transesterifications: first, the branchpoint adenosine $2'$-hydroxyl attacks the $5'$ splice site to form the $2'$–$5'$ lariat linkage; second, the Exon$1$ $3'$-hydroxyl attacks the $3'$ splice site to ligate exons. It then correctly predicts outcomes: M$1$ yields no lariat because the branchpoint base is not adenosine and no alternative adenosine is available; M$2$ yields no lariat due to loss of a recognizable U2-type $5'$ splice site; M$3$ yields and accumulates the lariat–$3'$ exon intermediate but cannot ligate exons; M$4$ yields no lariat because the required branchpoint $2'$-hydroxyl is absent. Verdict — Correct.\n\nC. This option claims that the first step uses the branchpoint “irrespective of ribose chemistry,” implying that a $2'$-deoxyadenosine can substitute; however, the $2'$-hydroxyl is the nucleophile, so its absence precludes the first step. It also claims that M$2$ can use a cryptic $5'$ splice site or proceed regardless; but the engineered change removes the canonical $GU$, and no alternative $5'$ site is specified, making first-step chemistry highly unlikely in a U2-type context. It further claims M$3$ blocks lariat formation, contrary to the fact that the first step does not require the $3'$ splice site. Finally, it suggests M$1$ forms a lariat at guanosine, which is inconsistent with the adenosine requirement and the lack of alternative adenosines. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. This option asserts that all four mutants can form lariats because “transesterification does not require specific bases or hydroxyls,” ignoring the critical requirement for the branchpoint $2'$-hydroxyl and the sequence-specific recognition of the $5'$ and $3'$ splice sites. M$1$, M$2$, and M$4$ specifically remove essential features for the first step. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only option that correctly integrates mechanism and mutant outcomes is option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2945605"}]}
