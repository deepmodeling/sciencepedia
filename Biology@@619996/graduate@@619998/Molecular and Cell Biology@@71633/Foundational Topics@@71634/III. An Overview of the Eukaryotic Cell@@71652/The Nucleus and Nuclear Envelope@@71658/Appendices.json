A solution will be derived.\n\nThe task is to compute the total number of a specific nucleoporin molecule within a single cell. The problem provides direct measurements that allow for a systematic calculation. We must proceed with logical rigor.\n\nFirst, we must determine the total surface area of the nuclear envelope. The nucleus is modeled as a sphere of radius $r$. The formula for the surface area $A$ of a sphere is:\n$$A = 4\\pi r^2$$\nSubstituting the given value for the radius, $r = 6\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$A = 4\\pi (6\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m})^2 = 4\\pi (36\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^2) = 144\\pi\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^2$$\n\nSecond, we calculate the total number of Nuclear Pore Complexes, $N_{\\text{NPC}}$, on the surface of the nucleus.

The problem states there are $N_{\\text{NUP/NPC}} = 32$ copies of this protein per NPC. It is also assumed that all copies are assembled into NPCs. Therefore, we multiply the total number of NPCs by the number of molecules per NPC:\n$$N_{\\text{total}} = N_{\\text{NPC}} \\times N_{\\text{NUP/NPC}}$$\n$$N_{\\text{total}} = (720\\pi) \\times 32 = 23040\\pi$$\n\nFinally, we must provide a numerical answer rounded to three significant figures.

The scenario, involving pressure-induced deformation and rupture of a component of the nuclear envelope, is a relevant and non-trivial topic in cell mechanics. The problem is well-posed; it provides a clear objective and sufficient, consistent information to derive a unique solution based on the specified physical laws. The assumptions, such as a hemispherical shape at failure and a rigid boundary, are standard idealizations in biophysical modeling that render the problem tractable. All terms are defined objectively. The problem is a valid exercise in applying fundamental physical principles to a biological context.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation proceeds by connecting the mechanical equilibrium of the pressurized membrane patch with its material properties at the point of failure.\n\nFirst, we consider the force balance on the curved membrane patch. For a thin, tension-dominated spherical interface, the relationship between the pressure difference $\\Delta p$ across the interface and the membrane tension $T$ (force per unit length) is given by the Young-Laplace equation. For a sphere of radius $R$, this is:\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{2T}{R}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the intranuclear overpressure is $s$, so we identify $\\Delta p = s$. The problem also states that at the moment of failure, the pressure is the threshold pressure $s_{\\text{th}}$, and the patch has formed a hemisphere with a radius of curvature equal to the defect radius, $a$. Therefore, at failure, we have $R = a$. Substituting these conditions into the Young-Laplace equation gives the relationship for the system at the point of rupture:\n$$\ns_{\\text{th}} = \\frac{2T_{c}}{a}\n$$\nwhere $T_{c}$ is the critical tension in the membrane at which it fails.\n\nNext, we use the second piece of information provided: the constitutive law for the membrane material. The problem states that the patch follows linear area elasticity up to failure. The relationship between the membrane tension $T$ and the areal strain $\\alpha$ is given by the area-stretch modulus, $K_{A}$:\n$$\nT = K_{A} \\alpha\n$$\nHere, the areal strain $\\alpha$ is defined as the fractional change in area, $\\alpha = \\frac{A - A_{0}}{A_{0}}$, where $A$ is the current area and $A_{0}$ is the initial, unstretched area.\n\nFailure is specified to occur when the local areal strain reaches a critical value, $\\alpha_{c}$. According to the constitutive law, the tension in the membrane at this critical strain is the critical tension, $T_{c}$:\n$$\nT_{c} = K_{A} \\alpha_{c}\n$$\nThis equation provides the failure strength of the membrane material in terms of the given parameters.\n\nFinally, to find the threshold pressure $s_{\\text{th}}$, we substitute the expression for the critical tension $T_{c}$ into the Young-Laplace equation for the failure condition.\nBy substituting $T_{c} = K_{A} \\alpha_{c}$ into $s_{\\text{th}} = \\frac{2T_{c}}{a}$, we obtain the final expression for the minimal overpressure required to rupture the patch:\n$$\ns_{\\text{th}} = \\frac{2 K_{A} \\alpha_{c}}{a}\n$$\nThe dimensional consistency of this result must be verified. The area-stretch modulus $K_{A}$ has units of energy per area, or equivalently, force per length (e.g., $\\text{N} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-1}$). The critical strain $\\alpha_{c}$ is a dimensionless quantity. The radius $a$ has units of length (e.g., $\\text{m}$). Therefore, the units of $s_{\\text{th}}$ are $(\\text{N} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-1}) / \\text{m} = \\text{N} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-2}$, which are Pascals ($\\text{Pa}$), the correct unit for pressure, as required.
