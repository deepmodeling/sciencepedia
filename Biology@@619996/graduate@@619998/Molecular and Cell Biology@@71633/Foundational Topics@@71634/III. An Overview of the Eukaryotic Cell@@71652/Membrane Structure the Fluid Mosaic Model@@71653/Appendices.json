It is a standard problem in the biophysics of membranes based on the well-established Helfrich–Canham model. The assumptions and provided parameters are sufficient and self-consistent for deriving a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**. We proceed to the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to derive the steady pulling force $F$ required to maintain a cylindrical membrane tether of length $L$ and radius $R$ which is pulled from a large, flat lipid bilayer. The derivation will be based on minimizing the Helfrich–Canham free energy of the system.\n\nFirst, we define the energy functional. The Helfrich–Canham free energy $\\mathcal{F}$ for a patch of membrane with surface area $A$ is given by the integral of the energy density over this area.\n$$\n\\mathcal{F} = \\int_{A} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa (c_1 + c_2 - c_0)^2 + \\bar{\\kappa} c_1 c_2 + \\sigma \\right) dA\n$$\nHere, $\\kappa$ is the bending rigidity, $\\bar{\\kappa}$ is the saddle-splay modulus, $\\sigma$ is the surface tension, $c_1$ and $c_2$ are the two principal curvatures, and $c_0$ is the spontaneous curvature.\n\nWe apply the simplifying assumptions given in the problem statement:\n1.  The spontaneous curvature is zero, so $c_0 = 0$.\n2.  The topology is fixed. According to the Gauss–Bonnet theorem, the integral of the Gaussian curvature, $K = c_1 c_2$, over a surface of a fixed topology is constant. Thus, the term $\\int \\bar{\\kappa} K \\, dA$ is a constant energy offset that does not contribute to the force, and we can neglect it.\n\nThe relevant energy functional simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F} = \\int_{A} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa (c_1 + c_2)^2 + \\sigma \\right) dA\n$$\nThe mean curvature is defined as $H = \\frac{1}{2}(c_1 + c_2)$. Substituting this into the functional gives:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F} = \\int_{A} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa (2H)^2 + \\sigma \\right) dA = \\int_{A} (2\\kappa H^2 + \\sigma) dA\n$$\nNext, we apply this functional to the specific geometry of the tether. The problem states the tether is a right circular cylinder of radius $R$ and length $L$. For a cylinder, the principal curvatures are $c_1 = 1/R$ (the curvature of the circular cross-section) and $c_2 = 0$ (the curvature along the straight axis).\n\nThe mean curvature $H$ of the cylinder is therefore constant over its surface:\n$$\nH = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{R} + 0 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2R}\n$$\nThe surface area of the cylindrical tether is $A = 2\\pi R L$. Since the energy density is uniform over the surface of the cylinder, the integral becomes a simple product of the energy density and the total area:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}(R, L) = \\left[ 2\\kappa \\left(\\frac{1}{2R}\\right)^2 + \\sigma \\right] (2\\pi R L)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}(R, L) = \\left( \\frac{2\\kappa}{4R^2} + \\sigma \\right) (2\\pi R L) = \\left( \\frac{\\kappa}{2R^2} + \\sigma \\right) (2\\pi R L)\n$$\nDistributing the area term, we obtain the total free energy of the tether as a function of its radius and length:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}(R, L) = \\frac{\\pi \\kappa L}{R} + 2\\pi \\sigma R L\n$$\nThe membrane is a fluid, so for a given length $L$, the radius $R$ will adjust to minimize the free energy $\\mathcal{F}$.

In a quasi-static process, the work done by the force, $F\\,dL$, is equal to the change in the system's free energy, $d\\mathcal{F}$. Thus, the force is the thermodynamic conjugate of the length $L$:\n$$\nF = \\frac{d\\mathcal{F}_{min}}{dL}\n$$\nMore formally, since $\\mathcal{F}$ is a function of $R$ and $L$, and $R$ is itself a function of the system parameters that minimizes energy, the force is given by the partial derivative with respect to $L$, evaluated at the equilibrium radius $R_{eq}$:\n$$\nF = \\left. \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{F}(R, L)}{\\partial L} \\right|_{R=R_{eq}}\n$$\nWe calculate the partial derivative of $\\mathcal{F}(R,L)$ with respect to $L$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{F}}{\\partial L} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial L} \\left( \\frac{\\pi \\kappa L}{R} + 2\\pi \\sigma R L \\right) = \\frac{\\pi \\kappa}{R} + 2\\pi \\sigma R\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for the equilibrium radius $R_{eq} = \\sqrt{\\kappa/(2\\sigma)}$ into this expression for the force:\n$$\nF = \\frac{\\pi \\kappa}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\kappa}{2\\sigma}}} + 2\\pi \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{\\kappa}{2\\sigma}}\n$$\nWe simplify each term.

The pulling force is constant, independent of the tether length $L$, which is a classic result for this idealized model.\n\nThe validity of this expression rests on the following physical approximations:\n1.  The tether can be accurately modeled as a perfect cylinder, which is valid for tethers that are long compared to their radius ($L \\gg R$).\n2.  The pulling process is quasi-static (infinitely slow), ensuring the system is always in mechanical and thermodynamic equilibrium.\n3.  End effects, such as the complex geometry where the tether joins the flat reservoir, are negligible.\n4.  The membrane behaves as a two-dimensional, continuous, and isotropic fluid.\n5.  The spontaneous curvature of the membrane is zero.\n6.

The analysis is most efficiently performed in the spatial Fourier domain. Let $\\delta \\hat{c}(\\mathbf{q}, t)$ be the spatial Fourier transform of $\\delta c(\\mathbf{r}, t)$. The diffusion equation in Fourier space becomes:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\delta \\hat{c}(\\mathbf{q}, t) = -D |\\mathbf{q}|^{2} \\delta \\hat{c}(\\mathbf{q}, t)\n$$\nThis ordinary differential equation has the solution $\\delta \\hat{c}(\\mathbf{q}, t+\\tau) = \\delta \\hat{c}(\\mathbf{q}, t) \\exp(-D|\\mathbf{q}|^{2}\\tau)$.\n\nThe fluorescence fluctuation $\\delta I(t)$ is given by $\\delta I(t) \\propto \\int d^{2}\\mathbf{r}\\, W(\\mathbf{r})\\, \\delta c(\\mathbf{r},t)$. Using Parseval's theorem, this can be written in Fourier space as $\\delta I(t) \\propto \\int d^2\\mathbf{q}\\, \\hat{W}(-\\mathbf{q})\\, \\delta\\hat{c}(\\mathbf{q},t)$, where $\\hat{W}(\\mathbf{q})$ is the Fourier transform of the observation profile $W(\\mathbf{r})$.\nThe unnormalized autocorrelation is then:\n$$\n\\langle \\delta I(t)\\delta I(t+\\tau)\\rangle \\propto \\iint \\frac{d^{2}\\mathbf{q}}{(2\\pi)^2} \\frac{d^{2}\\mathbf{q}'}{(2\\pi)^2} \\hat{W}(-\\mathbf{q})\\hat{W}(-\\mathbf{q}') \\langle \\delta\\hat{c}(\\mathbf{q},t)\\delta\\hat{c}(\\mathbf{q}', t+\\tau)\\rangle\n$$\nFor a system of independent diffusing particles, the fluctuations of different Fourier modes are uncorrelated: $\\langle\\delta\\hat{c}(\\mathbf{q},t)\\delta\\hat{c}(\\mathbf{q}',t)\\rangle \\propto (2\\pi)^2 \\delta(\\mathbf{q}+\\mathbf{q}')$.

Let the three components be cholesterol (chol), sphingomyelin (SM), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC). Let $N$ be the total number of moles of all components in the system. The system separates into two phases at equilibrium: a liquid-ordered phase ($L_o$) and a liquid-disordered phase ($L_d$).

Any overall composition point that lies on this tie-line will result in the same two equilibrium phases; only the relative amount of each phase will change. This relationship is quantified by the lever rule.\n\nTo derive the expression for the phase fraction $f^{(o)}$, we apply the principle of conservation of mass (or moles) for an arbitrary component $i$.

The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n\nTherefore, $f^{(o)} = 0.4000$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4000}$$", "id": "2953321"}]}
