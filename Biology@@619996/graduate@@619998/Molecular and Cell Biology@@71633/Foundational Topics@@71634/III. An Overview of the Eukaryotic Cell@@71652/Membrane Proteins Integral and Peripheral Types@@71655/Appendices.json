A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Correct Outcome**\n\n1.  **Protein Localization after Extraction:** The protein is defined as an \"integral membrane glycoprotein.\" Foundational Fact 1 states that such proteins are held in the lipid bilayer by one or more hydrophobic transmembrane segments. Foundational Fact 2 specifies that high $pH$ carbonate extraction disrupts electrostatic interactions, sufficient to release peripheral membrane proteins, but is insufficient to dislodge proteins anchored by hydrophobic interactions. Therefore, the single-pass integral glycoprotein will resist extraction and remain embedded in the microsomal membrane. Following ultracentrifugation, the membranes and their integral components will form the **pellet**. The protein will not be found in the supernatant.\n\n2.  **Protein Modification and Appearance on SDS-PAGE:** The protein is a \"glycoprotein\" with glycosylation occurring on its \"luminal\" domain. In sealed $ER$-derived microsomes, the lumen of the microsome corresponds to the lumen of the original $ER$. Foundational Fact 3 states that N-linked glycosylation occurs in the $ER$ lumen. This process adds carbohydrate moieties to the polypeptide chain. The same fact also states that these glycans \"are not removed by carbonate extraction.\" Consequently, the protein in the pellet will be in its glycosylated state.\n\n3.  **Effect of Glycosylation on Electrophoretic Mobility:** Foundational Fact 3 indicates that glycosylation \"increases the apparent molecular mass in $SDS-PAGE$.\" This means the glycosylated protein will migrate more slowly through the gel than its unglycosylated polypeptide backbone, appearing at a position corresponding to a higher molecular mass. Furthermore, Foundational Fact 4 notes that \"heterogeneous glycosylation often producing a diffuse band.\" N-linked glycosylation in a population of protein molecules is frequently non-uniform, resulting in a range of glycoforms. This heterogeneity in mass leads to a smeared or diffuse band rather than a sharp, single band on an $SDS-PAGE$ gel.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on this reasoning, the type $I$ integral glycoprotein will be recovered in the membrane pellet.

This entire statement aligns perfectly with the derived outcome.\n    -   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n-   **C.

The protein is recovered in the membrane pellet but migrates faster than the unglycosylated polypeptide, because glycosylation increases binding of sodium dodecyl sulfate and thus increases electrophoretic mobility.**\n    -   **Localization:** \"recovered in the membrane pellet\" is **Correct**.\n    -   **Appearance:** \"migrates faster than the unglycosylated polypeptide\" is **Incorrect**. Faster migration implies a lower apparent mass. Glycosylation adds mass, causing slower migration (higher apparent mass).\n    -   **Justification:** The reasoning provided is factually wrong. Glycans are bulky and typically less charged than the polypeptide backbone coated in $SDS$.
