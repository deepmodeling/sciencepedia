The charge number for a proton is $z=1$.\n\nThe electrochemical potential in the matrix (inside) is:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\mu^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{in}} + (1)F\\psi_{\\mathrm{in}} $$\nThe electrochemical potential in the intermembrane space (outside) is:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\mu^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{out}} + (1)F\\psi_{\\mathrm{out}} $$\nThe standard chemical potential $\\mu^{\\circ}$ is assumed to be the same in both compartments as the solvent is aqueous in both.\n\nThe difference, as defined in the problem, is $\\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{out}}$:\n$$ \\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = (\\mu^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{in}} + F\\psi_{\\mathrm{in}}) - (\\mu^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{out}} + F\\psi_{\\mathrm{out}}) $$\n$$ \\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = RT (\\ln a_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\ln a_{\\mathrm{out}}) + F (\\psi_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\psi_{\\mathrm{out}}) $$\n$$ \\Delta \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{a_{\\mathrm{in}}}{a_{\\mathrm{out}}}\\right) + F\\Delta\\psi $$\nHere, $a_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and $a_{\\mathrm{out}}$ are the activities of the hydrogen ion in the respective compartments, and $\\Delta\\psi$ is the given potential difference.\n\nThe relationship between pH and hydrogen ion activity, $a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$, is definitional: $\\mathrm{pH} \\equiv -\\log_{10}(a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}})$. This can be rearranged to express the natural logarithm of activity in terms of pH.

Consider a chemiosmotic description in which the electron transport chain (ETC) pumps protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane as electrons reduce oxygen, and the proton motive force drives adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis by the membrane adenosine triphosphatase (ATP synthase). Assume the following foundational facts:\n- Each pair of electrons from NADH that reduces one oxygen atom (that is, per reduction of $\\frac{1}{2}$ of an $\\mathrm{O}_2$ molecule) results in $h_{\\mathrm{O}} = 10$ protons pumped by the ETC.\n- The effective number of protons required per molecule of cytosolic ATP synthesized and exported, aggregating the membrane adenosine triphosphatase (ATP synthase) stoichiometry and transport costs, is $h_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = 4$.\n- At steady state, the proton pumping flux balances the sum of proton fluxes through ATP synthase and all other proton-conductive pathways (collectively referred to as leak, which includes basal proton leak and any conductance introduced by an uncoupler).\n\nDefine $J_{\\text{pump}}$ as the rate of proton pumping by the ETC, $J_{\\text{leak}}$ as the total proton leak rate, $J_{\\text{ATP}}$ as the ATP synthesis rate, and $J_{\\text{O}}$ as the rate of oxygen atom reduction events.

All terms are clearly defined, and sufficient information is provided to derive the requested relationships and perform the calculation. The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective. It is therefore valid, and a solution will be presented.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the $\\mathrm{P/O}$ ratio and mechanistic explanation.\n\nThe analysis begins with the principle of conservation of proton flux at steady state. The rate at which the electron transport chain (ETC) pumps protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, $J_{\\text{pump}}$, must be balanced by the rate at which protons flow back into the matrix. This return flow occurs through two pathways: productively through ATP synthase to synthesize ATP, and non-productively through all other pathways, collectively termed the proton leak, $J_{\\text{leak}}$.\n\nLet $J_{\\text{ATP\\_proton}}$ be the proton flux through ATP synthase. The steady-state condition is:\n$$J_{\\text{pump}} = J_{\\text{ATP\\_proton}} + J_{\\text{leak}}$$\nThe fluxes are related to the rates of oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis through the stoichiometric coefficients given in the problem statement.\nThe rate of proton pumping, $J_{\\text{pump}}$, is proportional to the rate of oxygen atom reduction, $J_{\\text{O}}$, with a proportionality constant $h_{\\mathrm{O}}$, the number of protons pumped per oxygen atom reduced.\n$$J_{\\text{pump}} = h_{\\mathrm{O}} J_{\\text{O}}$$\nThe rate of proton consumption by ATP synthase, $J_{\\text{ATP\\_proton}}$, is proportional to the rate of ATP synthesis, $J_{\\text{ATP}}$, with a proportionality constant $h_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$, the number of protons required to synthesize and export one molecule of ATP.\n$$J_{\\text{ATP\\_proton}} = h_{\\mathrm{ATP}} J_{\\text{ATP}}$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the conservation equation gives:\n$$h_{\\mathrm{O}} J_{\\text{O}} = h_{\\mathrm{ATP}} J_{\\text{ATP}} + J_{\\text{leak}}$$\nThe problem defines the leak fraction, $f$, as the ratio of the leak flux to the total pumping flux: $f \\equiv J_{\\text{leak}}/J_{\\text{pump}}$. From this definition, we can express the leak flux as:\n$$J_{\\text{leak}} = f \\cdot J_{\\text{pump}} = f h_{\\mathrm{O}} J_{\\text{O}}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $J_{\\text{leak}}$ into the flux balance equation yields:\n$$h_{\\mathrm{O}} J_{\\text{O}} = h_{\\mathrm{ATP}} J_{\\text{ATP}} + f h_{\\mathrm{O}} J_{\\text{O}}$$\nWe are required to find an expression for the $\\mathrm{P/O}$ ratio, which is defined as $\\mathrm{P/O} \\equiv J_{\\text{ATP}}/J_{\\text{O}}$. To derive this, we rearrange the equation to isolate the term $J_{\\text{ATP}}/J_{\\text{O}}$.\nFirst, gather terms involving $J_{\\text{O}}$ on one side:\n$$h_{\\mathrm{O}} J_{\\text{O}} - f h_{\\mathrm{O}} J_{\\text{O}} = h_{\\mathrm{ATP}} J_{\\text{ATP}}$$\nFactor out $h_{\\mathrm{O}} J_{\\text{O}}$:\n$$(1 - f) h_{\\mathrm{O}} J_{\\text{O}} = h_{\\mathrm{ATP}} J_{\\text{ATP}}$$\nFinally, divide both sides by $J_{\\text{O}}$ and $h_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$ to obtain the expression for the $\\mathrm{P/O}$ ratio:\n$$\\frac{J_{\\text{ATP}}}{J_{\\text{O}}} = \\frac{h_{\\mathrm{O}}}{h_{\\mathrm{ATP}}} (1 - f)$$\nThis is the required expression for the $\\mathrm{P/O}$ ratio as a function of $f$, $h_{\\mathrm{O}}$, and $h_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$.\n\nMechanistically, an uncoupler is a protonophore, a substance that inserts into the inner mitochondrial membrane and creates a futile pathway for protons to flow back into the matrix, bypassing the ATP synthase. This directly increases the leak flux, $J_{\\text{leak}}$. Consequently, the leak fraction $f = J_{\\text{leak}}/J_{\\text{pump}}$ increases.\nFrom the derived equation, $\\mathrm{P/O} = \\frac{h_{\\mathrm{O}}}{h_{\\mathrm{ATP}}}(1 - f)$, it is clear that as $f$ increases, the term $(1 - f)$ decreases, leading to a decrease in the $\\mathrm{P/O}$ ratio. This explains why ATP synthesis decreases relative to oxygen consumption: a larger fraction of the proton motive force is dissipated through the leak pathway, leaving a smaller fraction to drive ATP synthesis.\nTo explain the increase in oxygen consumption, consider that the mitochondrion must maintain a certain proton motive force ($\\Delta p$) or, from a functional perspective, a required rate of ATP synthesis ($J_{\\text{ATP}}$) to meet cellular demand. The increased leak caused by the uncoupler dissipates $\\Delta p$. To counteract this dissipation and maintain $\\Delta p$ (and thus drive the necessary $J_{\\text{ATP}}$), the ETC must pump protons at a higher rate, $J_{\\text{pump}}$. Since $J_{\\text{pump}} = h_{\\mathrm{O}} J_{\\text{O}}$, an increase in $J_{\\text{pump}}$ necessitates a corresponding increase in the rate of oxygen consumption, $J_{\\text{O}}$. Therefore, oxygen consumption increases to compensate for the inefficiency introduced by the uncoupler, with the excess energy from substrate oxidation being released as heat.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the change in $\\mathrm{P/O}$ ratio.\n\nWe use the derived formula $\\mathrm{P/O} = \\frac{h_{\\mathrm{O}}}{h_{\\mathrm{ATP}}}(1 - f)$ with the given numerical values: $h_{\\mathrm{O}} = 10$ and $h_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = 4$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial $\\mathrm{P/O}$ ratio before the addition of the uncoupler, using the initial leak fraction $f_{0} = 0.15$.\n$$\\mathrm{P/O}_{\\text{before}} = \\frac{10}{4}(1 - 0.15) = 2.5 \\times 0.85 = 2.125$$\nNext, we calculate the final $\\mathrm{P/O}$ ratio after the addition of the uncoupler, using the final leak fraction $f_{1} = 0.75$.\n$$\\mathrm{P/O}_{\\text{after}} = \\frac{10}{4}(1 - 0.75) = 2.5 \\times 0.25 = 0.625$$\nThe change in the $\\mathrm{P/O}$ ratio, $\\Delta(\\mathrm{P/O})$, is the difference between the final and initial values.\n$$\\Delta(\\mathrm{P/O}) = \\mathrm{P/O}_{\\text{after}} - \\mathrm{P/O}_{\\text{before}} = 0.625 - 2.125 = -1.5$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
