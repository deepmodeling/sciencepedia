The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a complete solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the dimensionless packing parameter, $P$. Let us consider an aggregate formed by $N$ identical amphiphilic molecules. Each molecule is characterized by three geometric parameters:\n1. The volume of its hydrophobic tail(s), $v$.\n2. The optimal surface area occupied by its polar headgroup at the hydrophobic core-water interface, $a_0$.\n3. The maximum possible length of the hydrophobic tails, which corresponds to the fully extended all-trans conformation, $l_c$.\n\nThe total volume of the hydrophobic core of the aggregate is $V = Nv$, and the total interfacial surface area is $A = Na_0$. The fundamental constraint is that the dimension of the hydrophobic core, in any direction originating from the interface, cannot exceed the maximum chain length $l_c$. Let us denote this dimension, which is the radius for curved structures or the half-thickness for planar structures, as $R$. Thus, we must have $R \\le l_c$.\n\nWe analyze the geometric relationships for three idealized aggregate morphologies.\n\nCase 1: Spherical Micelle\nThe hydrophobic core is a sphere of radius $R_{sph}$. The volume of this sphere is $V_{sph} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_{sph}^3$, and its surface area is $A_{sph} = 4\\pi R_{sph}^2$. Substituting the expressions for the total volume and area, we have:\n$$Nv = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_{sph}^3$$\n$$Na_0 = 4\\pi R_{sph}^2$$\nTo find the relationship between $v$, $a_0$, and $R_{sph}$, we can divide the volume equation by the area equation. However, a more direct approach is to relate the aggregate properties $V$ and $A$ to establish a general formula relating the radius to volume and area for a given shape. For a sphere, $R_{sph} = \\frac{3V_{sph}}{A_{sph}}$. Applying this to the single-molecule level by considering the average volume $v$ and area $a_0$ it occupies within the aggregate:\n$$R_{sph} = \\frac{3(Nv)}{(Na_0)} = \\frac{3v}{a_0}$$\nThis radius $R_{sph}$ must satisfy the physical constraint $R_{sph} \\le l_c$. Therefore, for a stable spherical micelle to form, the molecular parameters must satisfy:\n$$\\frac{3v}{a_0} \\le l_c \\implies \\frac{v}{a_0 l_c} \\le \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nCase 2: Cylindrical Micelle (of infinite length)\nThe hydrophobic core is a cylinder of radius $R_{cyl}$. Let us consider a segment of length $L$. The volume of this segment is $V_{cyl} = \\pi R_{cyl}^2 L$, and its lateral surface area is $A_{cyl} = 2\\pi R_{cyl} L$. We neglect the ends, assuming an infinitely long cylinder. Substituting the total volume and area for $N$ molecules within this segment:\n$$Nv = \\pi R_{cyl}^2 L$$\n$$Na_0 = 2\\pi R_{cyl} L$$\nDividing the volume expression by the area expression:\n$$\\frac{Nv}{Na_0} = \\frac{\\pi R_{cyl}^2 L}{2\\pi R_{cyl} L} = \\frac{R_{cyl}}{2}$$\nThis gives the radius of the cylinder in terms of the molecular parameters:\n$$R_{cyl} = \\frac{2v}{a_0}$$\nApplying the physical constraint $R_{cyl} \\le l_c$:\n$$\\frac{2v}{a_0} \\le l_c \\implies \\frac{v}{a_0 l_c} \\le \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nCase 3: Planar Bilayer (of infinite extent)\nThe hydrophobic core is a planar sheet of thickness $2R_{bilayer}$, where $R_{bilayer}$ is the thickness of a single leaflet. Consider a patch of the bilayer with surface area $A_{patch}$. The volume of the hydrophobic core in this patch is $V_{bilayer} = A_{patch} \\times (2R_{bilayer})$. The total interface area for this patch is the sum of the top and bottom surfaces, $A_{bilayer} = 2A_{patch}$. For $N$ molecules in this patch:\n$$Nv = A_{patch} \\times (2R_{bilayer})$$\n$$Na_0 = 2A_{patch}$$\nFrom the second equation, we find $A_{patch} = \\frac{Na_0}{2}$. Substituting this into the first equation:\n$$Nv = \\left(\\frac{Na_0}{2}\\right) (2R_{bilayer}) = Na_0 R_{bilayer}$$\nThis yields the leaflet thickness in terms of the molecular parameters:\n$$R_{bilayer} = \\frac{v}{a_0}$$\nThe physical constraint is that the length of the chains in one leaflet, $R_{bilayer}$, must be less than or equal to the maximum chain length $l_c$. Thus, $R_{bilayer} \\le l_c$:\n$$\\frac{v}{a_0} \\le l_c \\implies \\frac{v}{a_0 l_c} \\le 1$$\n\nFrom these three cases, we identify the common dimensionless grouping $\\frac{v}{a_0 l_c}$ as the critical parameter that dictates the preferred geometry. We define this as the packing parameter, $P$:\n$$P = \\frac{v}{a_0 l_c}$$\nThe value of $P$ determines the favored aggregate structure based on which geometric condition can be most readily satisfied:\n- Spherical micelles are favored for $P \\approx \\frac{1}{3}$. The molecule has a cone-like effective shape.\n- Cylindrical micelles are favored for $P$ in the range $(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{2}]$, with an ideal value of $P=\\frac{1}{2}$. The molecule has a truncated cone effective shape.\n- Planar bilayers are favored for $P$ in the range $(\\frac{1}{2}, 1]$, with an ideal value of $P=1$. The molecule has a cylindrical effective shape.\n\nNext, we compute the value of $P$ for the given phospholipid. The provided values are:\n- $v = 0.90 \\, \\text{nm}^3$\n- $a_0 = 0.65 \\, \\text{nm}^2$\n- $l_c = 1.8 \\, \\text{nm}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $P$:\n$$P = \\frac{0.90}{0.65 \\times 1.8}$$\nTo obtain an exact rational number, we convert the given decimal values to fractions: $0.90 = \\frac{9}{10}$, $0.65 = \\frac{65}{100} = \\frac{13}{20}$, and $1.8 = \\frac{18}{10} = \\frac{9}{5}$.\n$$P = \\frac{\\frac{9}{10}}{\\frac{13}{20} \\times \\frac{9}{5}} = \\frac{\\frac{9}{10}}{\\frac{117}{100}} = \\frac{9}{10} \\times \\frac{100}{117} = \\frac{90}{117}$$\nBoth numerator and denominator are divisible by $9$:\n$$P = \\frac{90 \\div 9}{117 \\div 9} = \\frac{10}{13}$$\nThis is the exact rational form of the packing parameter.\n\nFinally, we must justify why bilayers are favored over spherical micelles for this molecule using the derived criteria and thermodynamic arguments.\nThe calculated packing parameter is $P = \\frac{10}{13} \\approx 0.769231$.\nOur derived geometric criteria state that spherical micelles require $P \\le \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.333$, whereas planar bilayers require $P \\le 1$. The calculated value of $P \\approx 0.77$ is much larger than the value compatible with spherical packing and falls squarely in the range for bilayer formation.\n\nThe thermodynamic justification rests on the minimization of the free energy per molecule in the aggregate. This free energy has two dominant opposing contributions relevant to this problem:\n1.  **Interfacial Free Energy**: This term favors the aggregation of hydrophobic tails to minimize contact with water. It drives the system to adopt a geometry where each headgroup can occupy its optimal area $a_0$. Deviations from $a_0$ are energetically costly.\n2.  **Chain Conformational Free Energy (Entropic Cost)**: Hydrocarbon chains are flexible and have high conformational entropy. Confining them within an aggregate reduces this entropy, which is energetically unfavorable. This penalty increases severely as the chains are forced to stretch towards their maximum length $l_c$ or are compressed into a volume smaller than $v$.\n\nLet us evaluate the consequences of forcing this molecule ($P \\approx 0.77$) into a spherical micelle versus a bilayer.\n- **In a spherical micelle**: To satisfy the core-filling requirement without voids, the radius of the micelle must be $R_{sph} = \\frac{3v}{a_0}$. Using our definition of $P$, this can be written as $R_{sph} = 3 P l_c$. For the given molecule, this would require a radius of $R_{sph} = 3 \\times \\frac{10}{13} \\times l_c = \\frac{30}{13} l_c \\approx 2.3 l_c$. This is physically impossible, as the chains cannot stretch to more than twice their maximum length. A stable, space-filling spherical micelle cannot be formed by this phospholipid. Any attempt to form a smaller spherical aggregate with $R \\le l_c$ would create severe packing problems: either the headgroups would be forced far apart (increasing $a_0$ and exposing hydrophobic core to water, which is a large interfacial energy penalty) or the chains would be highly compressed and deformed, leading to a prohibitive loss of conformational entropy.\n- **In a planar bilayer**: The required thickness of one leaflet is $R_{bilayer} = \\frac{v}{a_0}$, which can be written as $R_{bilayer} = P l_c$. For this molecule, the thickness is $R_{bilayer} = \\frac{10}{13} l_c \\approx 0.77 l_c$. This condition is physically viable, as $R_{bilayer} < l_c$. The chains must extend to approximately $77\\%$ of their maximal length, on average. This allows them to retain a significant degree of conformational freedom (e.g., via gauche-trans isomerizations), avoiding the extreme entropic penalty associated with full stretching. The headgroups can maintain their optimal area $a_0$ at a planar interface.\n\nIn summary, the geometry of a phospholipid with $P \\approx 0.77$ is incompatible with the severe curvature of a spherical micelle, as forming such a structure would lead to a physically impossible state or an immense free energy penalty. In contrast, this molecule's geometry is highly compatible with the zero curvature of a planar bilayer, allowing for efficient packing that satisfies the constraints on headgroup area and chain length while minimizing both interfacial and conformational free energy penalties. Therefore, the bilayer is the thermodynamically favored structure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{10}{13}}$$", "id": "2951217"}, {"introduction": "Having established why bilayers form, we now turn to their dynamic properties, particularly the transition between a rigid gel and a fluid state, which is critical for membrane function.

Using only fundamental thermodynamic relations for phase transitions and core principles of hydrocarbon chain packing, predict the relative ordering of $T_m$ for the two bilayers and justify your choice.\n\nYour reasoning must begin from the equilibrium condition for a first-order transition, namely that the molar Gibbs free energy change satisfies $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{gel}\\to \\mathrm{fluid}}=0$ at $T_m$, with $\\Delta G=\\Delta H - T\\Delta S$, and should connect macroscopic $T_m$ differences to molecular-level differences in van der Waals contact, conformational freedom, and cross-sectional area caused by the presence or absence of a cis double bond in the hydrocarbon chain.

The ordering of $T_m$ cannot be predicted from saturation versus unsaturation; it depends mainly on headgroup and ionic strength, which dominate over hydrocarbon structure in determining $T_m$.", "solution": "We are asked to compare the gel-to-fluid phase transition temperature $T_m$ for two phosphatidylcholines that differ only in the saturation state of the $sn\\!-\\!2$ chain: $18\\!:\\!0$ (stearoyl) versus $18\\!:\\!1(9Z)$ (oleoyl). The relevant starting point is the thermodynamic condition for the transition:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{gel}\\to \\mathrm{fluid}}(T_m) \\;=\\; \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{gel}\\to \\mathrm{fluid}} \\;-\\; T_m \\,\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{gel}\\to \\mathrm{fluid}} \\;=\\; 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad T_m \\;=\\; \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{gel}\\to \\mathrm{fluid}}}{\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{gel}\\to \\mathrm{fluid}}}.\n$$\nThus, any molecular feature that decreases $\\Delta H$ for melting and/or increases $\\Delta S$ for melting will decrease $T_m$; the converse will increase $T_m$.\n\nWe now connect $\\Delta H$ and $\\Delta S$ to hydrocarbon packing. In the gel phase, saturated chains (e.g., $16\\!:\\!0$ and $18\\!:\\!0$) adopt predominantly all-trans conformations, are extended, and pack tightly, maximizing van der Waals contacts and minimizing free volume. This yields a relatively low enthalpy for the gel state and a large enthalpic cost to disrupt packing upon melting, i.e., a larger $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{gel}\\to \\mathrm{fluid}}$. The fluid phase has higher conformational disorder and larger cross-sectional area per chain, giving higher entropy; the change in entropy upon melting, $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{gel}\\to \\mathrm{fluid}}$, is positive.\n\nIntroducing a cis double bond at position $9$ in an $18$-carbon chain (the $9Z$ olefin) imposes a rigid kink of approximately tens of degrees in the hydrocarbon backbone, which has two coupled consequences:\n\n- In the gel phase, the kink disrupts linear alignment and reduces the number and quality of van der Waals contacts both within a leaflet and between opposing leaflets. The gel is enthalpically less stabilized than the fully saturated counterpart; therefore the enthalpic increment needed to melt, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{gel}\\to \\mathrm{fluid}}$, is reduced.\n\n- In the fluid phase, the presence of the kink increases the conformational freedom of the disordered state and increases the average cross-sectional area per chain, raising the entropy of the fluid and often lowering the residual order of the gel relative to the saturated case. As a result, the entropy change upon melting, $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{gel}\\to \\mathrm{fluid}}$, is typically larger (or at least not smaller) for the unsaturated lipid.\n\nBecause $T_m = \\Delta H/\\Delta S$, a decrease in $\\Delta H$ combined with an increase (or no decrease) in $\\Delta S$ will decrease $T_m$ relative to the fully saturated analog. This argument relies solely on the change in packing efficiency and conformational freedom due to the cis double bond and does not invoke any shortcut formulas.\n\nApplying this to the two specific lipids:\n\n- Lipid $\\mathrm{X}$ ($16\\!:\\!0/18\\!:\\!0$) has two saturated chains ($16\\!:\\!0$ at $sn\\!-\\!1$ and $18\\!:\\!0$ at $sn\\!-\\!2$). In the gel, both can pack tightly, maximizing van der Waals contacts; upon melting, disrupting these contacts requires a comparatively large enthalpic input, and the gel-to-fluid entropy gain is moderate relative to a kinked chain.\n\n- Lipid $\\mathrm{Y}$ ($16\\!:\\!0/18\\!:\\!1(9Z)$) has one saturated and one cis-monounsaturated chain. The $18\\!:\\!1(9Z)$ chain cannot align to maximize van der Waals contacts in the gel, decreasing the stabilization of the gel and increasing the fluid-like character even at lower temperatures. Consequently, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{gel}\\to \\mathrm{fluid}}$ is smaller and $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{gel}\\to \\mathrm{fluid}}$ is larger (or comparable), leading to a lower $T_m$ than lipid $\\mathrm{X}$.\n\nWe also note that chain length per se tends to increase $T_m$ with added methylene units due to increased van der Waals interactions. However, in this comparison, the chain lengths are the same at $sn\\!-\\!2$ ($18$ carbons) and the decisive difference is the presence of the cis double bond in lipid $\\mathrm{Y}$, which dominates the effect on packing. The headgroup is identical (phosphatidylcholine), and the conditions exclude effects of ions or sterols, so headgroup electrostatics or ionic strength do not invert the ordering.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\n- Option A: States $T_m(16\\!:\\!0/18\\!:\\!0) > T_m(16\\!:\\!0/18\\!:\\!1(9Z))$ and attributes this to the cis double bond introducing a kink that weakens gel packing, lowering $\\Delta H$ and increasing $\\Delta S$, thus lowering $T_m$. This aligns with the thermodynamic relation $T_m=\\Delta H/\\Delta S$ and the known packing effects of a $9Z$ double bond. Verdict: Correct.\n\n- Option B: Claims the unsaturation raises $T_m$ because the double bond rigidifies the chain and enhances ordering. While a cis double bond does rigidify locally (reducing torsional flexibility around the double bond), its geometric kink disrupts linear packing and reduces van der Waals contacts in the gel, which lowers, not raises, $T_m$. Rigidification is not equivalent to better packing in this context. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- Option C: Asserts approximate equality of $T_m$ due to equal total carbon count. Total carbon number is not the dominant determinant; saturation state strongly modulates packing and $T_m$. A single cis double bond typically produces a substantial decrease in $T_m$ relative to full saturation at the same length. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- Option D: Attributes the main control of $T_m$ to headgroup and ionic strength and suggests unsaturation is not predictive. Under the stated identical-headgroup, controlled-solution conditions, hydrocarbon saturation is a primary determinant of $T_m$. Ionic strength effects are minimal for zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine bilayers in the absence of multivalent ions or specific binding, and they do not outweigh the large packing effect of a cis double bond.

The acyl chains are in an extended, all-trans conformation and are tightly packed in a regular lattice. This results in high orientational order (high $S_{CD}$) and very low lateral mobility (extremely low $D$).\n    - For $T > T_m$, lipids exist in the **liquid-disordered phase** ($L_d$). The acyl chains have significant conformational freedom (many gauche defects) and are loosely packed. This results in low orientational order (low $S_{CD}$) and high lateral mobility (high $D$).\n2.  **Cholesterol's Interaction**: Cholesterol is a rigid, planar amphipathic molecule. It inserts into the bilayer with its hydroxyl group near the polar headgroups and its rigid steroid ring system parallel to the lipid acyl chains.\n3.  **The Liquid-Ordered Phase ($L_o$)**: In the presence of cholesterol, a third phase, the **liquid-ordered phase** ($L_o$), can form. In this phase, the rigid cholesterol molecule forces the adjacent acyl chains to adopt a more extended, ordered conformation, leading to high orientational order (high $S_{CD}$) similar to the gel phase. However, the bulky cholesterol molecule itself disrupts the tight, crystalline packing of the acyl chains, preventing the formation of a rigid lattice. This disruption allows for significant lateral mobility, so the diffusion coefficient $D$ is characteristic of a liquid, though typically lower than in the $L_d$ phase.\n4.  **Cholesterol's \"Buffering\" Effect**:\n    - **In the $L_d$ phase ($T > T_m$)**: Cholesterol orders the disordered chains. It fills voids between the chains, restricting their motion. This is the \"condensing effect\". The result is an increase in chain order ($S_{CD} \\uparrow$) and an increase in packing density and viscosity, which leads to a decrease in lateral diffusion ($D \\downarrow$). The membrane transitions from $L_d$ towards $L_o$.\n    - **In the $L_{\\beta'}$ phase ($T < T_m$)**: Cholesterol disrupts the rigid packing of the gel phase. It prevents the crystallization of acyl chains. This \"fluidizing\" effect breaks up the gel lattice, forming domains of the $L_o$ phase. While the chains remain ordered (high $S_{CD}$), the system is no longer a quasi-solid. The ability for molecules to move laterally is greatly enhanced. The result is a dramatic increase in the diffusion coefficient ($D \\uparrow$) relative to the near-zero value in the pure gel phase.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In DOPC at $T=25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ (well above $T_{m}$), adding $30\\%$ cholesterol increases $S_{CD}$ by condensing and straightening chains and decreases $D$ because tighter packing elevates membrane viscosity and reduces free area available for molecular hops.**\n- **System Analysis**: The lipid is DOPC with $T_m \\approx -16\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. The temperature is $T=25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. Since $T > T_m$, the pure DOPC membrane is in the liquid-disordered ($L_d$) phase.\n- **Evaluation**: According to the principles outlined above, adding cholesterol to an $L_d$ phase membrane induces order. The rigid steroid nucleus restricts the conformational freedom of the flexible unsaturated DOPC chains, increasing their average orientation along the bilayer normal. This corresponds to an increase in $S_{CD}$. This ordering and condensing effect increases packing density and intermolecular friction (viscosity), which in turn hinders lateral movement and thus decreases the diffusion coefficient $D$. The reasoning provided in the option is entirely consistent with this physical picture.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. In DPPC at $T=20\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ (well below $T_{m}$), pure DPPC is in a gel state with very low $D$; adding $30\\%$ cholesterol disrupts the gel into a liquid-ordered state that retains high chain order while increasing molecular mobility relative to the gel, so $D$ increases modestly compared to cholesterol-free DPPC at the same $T$.**\n- **System Analysis**: The lipid is DPPC with $T_m \\approx 41\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. The temperature is $T=20\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. Since $T < T_m$, the pure DPPC membrane is in the gel ($L_{\\beta'}$) phase.\n- **Evaluation**: In the gel phase, DPPC molecules are in a quasi-crystalline state with extremely low lateral mobility, hence a very low $D$. Adding cholesterol disrupts this tight packing, preventing crystallization and forming the $L_o$ phase. The $L_o$ phase is a liquid, meaning molecules can diffuse laterally, so $D$ increases dramatically from its near-zero value in the gel state. The term \"modestly\" is relative but acceptable in context. Simultaneously, the interaction with cholesterol maintains the acyl chains in an extended, ordered state, so chain order ($S_{CD}$) remains high. The description is accurate.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**C. In DOPC at $T=25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, adding $30\\%$ cholesterol decreases both $S_{CD}$ and $D$ because the sterol wedges between kinked chains to create more free volume, causing slower diffusion by obstruction.**\n- **System Analysis**: This is the same system as in option A (DOPC in the $L_d$ phase).\n- **Evaluation**: The statement claims that cholesterol *decreases* $S_{CD}$. This is incorrect. As established in the analysis of option A, cholesterol has an ordering effect on fluid-phase lipids, thus it *increases* $S_{CD}$. The reasoning that it \"create[s] more free volume\" is also incorrect; cholesterol has a condensing effect, reducing free volume. While decreased diffusion due to obstruction is a contributing factor, the premise about order and free volume is false.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. In DPPC at $T=50\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ (well above $T_{m}$), adding $30\\%$ cholesterol decreases $S_{CD}$ and increases $D$ by thinning the bilayer and lowering surface viscosity at fixed $T$.**\n- **System Analysis**: The lipid is DPPC with $T_m \\approx 41\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. The temperature is $T=50\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. Since $T > T_m$, the pure DPPC membrane is in the liquid-disordered ($L_d$) phase.\n- **Evaluation**: This situation is analogous to that of option A: a lipid membrane in the $L_d$ phase. Cholesterol should increase order and decrease diffusion. This option claims the opposite for both parameters: that cholesterol *decreases* $S_{CD}$ and *increases* $D$. This is fundamentally wrong. The ordering effect of cholesterol in a fluid membrane is a cornerstone of this topic.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Across both DOPC and DPPC at fixed $T$, the dominant way cholesterol alters $D$ is by reducing the surrounding solvent viscosity, so by the physics of two-dimensional diffusion in a membrane sheet, $D$ increases in all cases when cholesterol is added.**\n- **Evaluation**: This statement contains two major errors. First, cholesterol affects the viscosity *within the membrane* (an anisotropic, two-dimensional fluid), not the viscosity of the surrounding bulk solvent (water). Second, the conclusion that $D$ *increases in all cases* is false. As demonstrated in option A, when cholesterol is added to a membrane in the $L_d$ phase, $D$ decreases. The statement completely ignores the dual, state-dependent effect of cholesterol.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "2951150"}]}
