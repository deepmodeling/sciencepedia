A solution will be derived by analyzing each option against the provided mechanistic framework. The core of the problem is to identify strategies that counteract the key steps of the side reaction: the deprotonation of the Gly backbone amide and the subsequent intramolecular cyclization.\n\nBased on the provided principles, effective suppression strategies should involve one or more of the following:\n1.  Lowering the temperature to kinetically suppress the side reaction (Principle iv).\n2.  Minimizing reaction time to limit the extent of the side reaction.\n3.  Protecting the Gly backbone nitrogen to eliminate the nucleophile required for the cyclization step (as stated in \"Factors Disfavoring\").\n4.  Introducing a proton source to quench the transient Gly amide anion, preventing it from acting as a nucleophile (related to Principles i and iii).\n5.  Increasing steric hindrance at the Asp side-chain ester to physically block the intramolecular attack (as stated in \"Factors Disfavoring\").\n6.  Using a base that is sufficiently strong to remove the Fmoc group but not so strong as to excessively deprotonate the weakly acidic backbone amide (Principle i).\n\nNow, each option will be evaluated against these strategies.\n\nA. Perform Fmoc deprotection with $20\\%$ piperidine in DMF at $25\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ in two short treatments of $5$ minutes each, and include $0.1$ M 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) in the deprotection solution; assemble the Asp–Gly motif as a preformed dipeptide Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-Gly(2,4-dimethoxybenzyl, Dmb)-OH to protect the Gly backbone nitrogen.\n\nThis option presents two powerful, independent strategies for suppression.\nFirst, the incorporation of a preformed dipeptide where the Gly backbone nitrogen is protected with a 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl (Dmb) group directly addresses a key mechanistic requirement. As stated, the side reaction is disfavored by \"protection of the nucleophilic backbone nitrogen\". By protecting this nitrogen, the formation of the amide anion nucleophile (Principle iii) is completely prevented. This is one of the most effective known methods to block aspartimide formation.\nSecond, the inclusion of $0.1$ M HOBt, an acidic additive, provides a proton source in the basic deprotection cocktail. Should any deprotonation of a backbone amide occur, HOBt can rapidly reprotonate it, quenching the potent amide anion nucleophile and preventing the intramolecular attack. This is a common and effective strategy.\nThe use of standard temperature ($25\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$) and short treatment times ($2 \\times 5$ minutes) are reasonable conditions. The combination of these two orthogonal and highly effective strategies makes this protocol extremely robust against aspartimide formation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. Perform Fmoc deprotection with $2\\%$ 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) in DMF at $50\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ for $2\\times 20$ minutes, using Asp(OtBu) with no additional additives or backbone protection.\n\nThis option outlines conditions that would *promote*, not suppress, aspartimide formation.\nFirst, DBU is a significantly stronger base than piperidine. According to Principle (i), a stronger base will more effectively deprotonate the weakly acidic Gly backbone amide, thus increasing the concentration of the nucleophile that initiates the side reaction.\nSecond, the temperature is elevated to $50\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$. According to Principle (iv), this will increase the rate of all reactions, including the undesired aspartimide formation. Side reactions are often accelerated more than the main reaction at higher temperatures.\nThird, the total deprotection time is $40$ minutes, which is excessively long, particularly at elevated temperature, providing ample opportunity for the side reaction to occur.\nFinally, no mitigating strategies like additives or special protecting groups are used. This entire protocol is a recipe for maximizing, not minimizing, aspartimide formation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. Perform Fmoc deprotection with $10\\%$ piperidine in DMF containing $0.1$ M ethyl cyanohydroxyiminoacetate (Oxyma) at $0$–$5\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ for $2\\times 2$ minutes; use the sterically hindered Asp side-chain protection O-2-phenylisopropyl (O-2-PhiPr).\n\nThis option combines three distinct and valid suppression strategies.\nFirst, the reaction is performed at low temperature ($0$–$5\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$). According to Principle (iv), this will kinetically disfavor the aspartimide side reaction. This is a very common and effective method for controlling side reactions.\nSecond, the deprotection cocktail includes $0.1$ M Oxyma. Like HOBt, Oxyma is an acidic additive that serves as a proton donor to quench any transient amide anions, thereby suppressing the side reaction.\nThird, a sterically hindered side-chain protecting group, O-2-phenylisopropyl (O-2-PhiPr), is used on the Asp residue. The problem statement explicitly notes that the side reaction is \"disfavored by steric hindrance at the side-chain ester\". The bulky O-2-PhiPr group provides significant steric shielding around the side-chain carbonyl, physically impeding the intramolecular attack by the Gly backbone nitrogen. This is a targeted strategy based on the reaction mechanism.\nThe short reaction time ($2 \\times 2$ minutes) also helps minimize the extent of the side reaction, although at such low temperatures it might push the limits of \"practical Fmoc removal\". Nevertheless, as a strategy to suppress aspartimide, all components of this option are sound.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nD. Replace DMF with N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and use $20\\%$ 4-methylpiperidine at $50\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ for a single $10$ minute deprotection; use Asp(OtBu) without backbone protection or additives.\n\nThis option contains a critical flaw. The deprotection is conducted at an elevated temperature of $50\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$. As established in the analysis of option B and based on Principle (iv), higher temperatures accelerate reaction rates and will promote the unwanted aspartimide formation. While NMP is a common SPPS solvent and 4-methylpiperidine is a base similar to piperidine, the use of high temperature without any mitigating factors (like additives or specialized protecting groups) makes this a poor strategy for suppressing the side reaction.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nE. Reduce base concentration to $2\\%$ piperidine in DMF at $25\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ but extend the deprotection to a single $60$ minute treatment; use Asp(OtBu) without additives or backbone protection.\n\nThis strategy is misguided. While reducing the base concentration from the standard $20\\%$ to $2\\%$ will decrease the rate of all base-catalyzed processes, including aspartimide formation, the compensatory increase in reaction time to $60$ minutes is highly detrimental. Aspartimide formation is a cumulative process. Exposing the peptide to basic conditions for such a prolonged period, even at a lower base concentration, allows significant accumulation of the undesired product. Effective suppression of kinetically controlled side reactions generally relies on minimizing reaction time, not extending it. This protocol provides a very large time window for the side reaction to proceed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2932425"}]}
