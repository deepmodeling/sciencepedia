A deoxyribonucleotide in DNA consists of a deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.

Each such bridge constitutes one $3^{\\prime}\\text{-}5^{\\prime}$ phosphodiester bond along the backbone.\n\nFor a linear, unbranched chain of $n$ nucleotides with free $5^{\\prime}$ and $3^{\\prime}$ ends, the residues can be indexed in order from the $5^{\\prime}$ end: $\\mathrm{N}_{1}, \\mathrm{N}_{2}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{N}_{n}$.

Therefore, the number of phosphodiester bonds equals the number of adjacency pairs in the ordered list of $n$ residues.

There are exactly $n-1$ such pairs. This can also be formalized by viewing the backbone as a connected, acyclic path graph with $n$ vertices (residues) and $n-1$ edges (phosphodiester bonds). Terminal functionalities at the $5^{\\prime}$ and $3^{\\prime}$ ends (e.g., hydroxyl or monophosphate) do not add an additional phosphodiester bond because a phosphodiester requires esterification to two sugars; at the ends there is only one sugar-ester linkage (a phosphomonoester if a terminal phosphate is present), not a diester bridging two residues.\n\nHence, the total number of $3^{\\prime}\\text{-}5^{\\prime}$ phosphodiester bonds as a function of chain length $n$ is\n$$\nB(n) = n - 1.\n$$\nThis expression applies to any linear, unbranched, single-stranded DNA with free ends.

It presents a standard problem in the field of molecular biophysics concerning the topological properties of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).\n\nThe primary objective is to compute the superhelical density, denoted by $\\sigma$, for a given covalently closed circular DNA plasmid. The superhelical density is a dimensionless quantity that quantifies the degree of supercoiling. As stated in the problem, it is defined as the fractional deviation of the linking number ($Lk$) from its value in the relaxed reference state ($Lk_0$). Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{Lk - Lk_0}{Lk_0} $$\nThe linking number, $Lk$, is a topological invariant for a closed DNA molecule and represents the number of times one strand of the duplex winds around the other. For the topoisomer in question, the linking number is given as $Lk = 269$.\n\nThe relaxed linking number, $Lk_0$, corresponds to the linking number of the DNA molecule in a hypothetical, torque-free, relaxed conformation. For canonical B-form DNA, $Lk_0$ is determined by the total length of the DNA in base pairs, $N$, and the number of base pairs per helical turn, $h$. The problem provides the following values:\n-   Total length: $N = 3000$ bp.\n-   Helical pitch: $h = 10.5$ bp/turn for relaxed B-form DNA under physiological conditions.\n\nUsing these values, we first calculate $Lk_0$:\n$$ Lk_0 = \\frac{N}{h} = \\frac{3000}{10.5} = \\frac{2000}{7} \\approx 285.7142857... $$\nIt is important to note that while $Lk$ for any given closed circular DNA molecule must be an integer, the reference value $Lk_0$ is a parameter of the relaxed state ensemble and is not constrained to be an integer.\n\nWith the values of $Lk$ and $Lk_0$, we can now calculate the superhelical density $\\sigma$.

The first significant figure is $5$, followed by $8$, $5$, and $0$. Therefore, the value is $-0.05850$.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for an interpretation of the sign of the superhelical density.\nThe calculated value of $\\sigma$ is negative. A negative superhelical density ($\\sigma  0$) indicates that the DNA is negatively supercoiled. This arises from the DNA duplex being underwound relative to its relaxed B-form state, meaning $Lk  Lk_0$. The deficit in helical turns introduces torsional strain into the molecule. In a covalently closed circular DNA, this strain is partitioned between a change in twist ($Tw$) and the formation of writhe ($Wr$), causing the overall axis of the DNA to coil upon itself in three-dimensional space. Negative supercoiling is the predominant state of DNA in nearly all living organisms as it facilitates essential biological processes like replication and transcription, which require the separation of the DNA strands.\n\nConversely, a positive superhelical density ($\\sigma > 0$) would signify that the DNA is positively supercoiled. This occurs when the DNA is overwound ($Lk > Lk_0$), resulting in right-handed supercoils.
