This is given by Coulomb's law:\n$$\nU = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{abs}} \\frac{q_1 q_2}{r}\n$$\nFrom the problem statement, the absolute permittivity of the protein core is $\\varepsilon_{abs} = \\varepsilon \\varepsilon_0$, where $\\varepsilon$ is the dimensionless dielectric constant and $\\varepsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity. The charges are $q_1 = +e$ and $q_2 = -e$.

This expression gives the energy for one such interaction in units of Joules, provided all quantities are in SI units.\n\nThe problem requires the molar stabilization energy, $E_{molar}$. This is obtained by multiplying the energy of a single interaction, $U$, by Avogadro's constant, $N_A$:\n$$\nE_{molar} = N_A U = -\\frac{N_A e^2}{4\\pi\\varepsilon\\varepsilon_0 r}\n$$\nThe units of this expression are Joules per mole ($\\text{J}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$).\n\nThe final answer must be in kilojoules per mole ($\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$). To perform this unit conversion, we must divide the expression by $1000$:\n$$\nE_{\\text{molar, kJ}} = \\frac{E_{molar}}{1000} = -\\frac{N_A e^2}{1000 \\cdot 4\\pi\\varepsilon\\varepsilon_0 r}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the separation distance $r = 4\\,\\text{\\AA}$. To maintain consistency with SI units for the other constants, this distance must be converted to meters. Since $1\\,\\text{\\AA} = 10^{-10}\\,\\text{m}$, the distance is $r = 4 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\text{m}$.\n\nWe now substitute this value for $r$ into the expression for the molar energy in $\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$:\n$$\nE_{\\text{molar, kJ}}(\\varepsilon) = -\\frac{N_A e^2}{1000 \\cdot 4\\pi\\varepsilon\\varepsilon_0 (4 \\times 10^{-10})}\n$$\nThe problem demands a closed-form expression in terms of $\\varepsilon$, $N_A$, $e$, and $\\varepsilon_0$.

This means that the binding of an oxygen molecule to one subunit of the hemoglobin tetramer increases the affinity of the remaining subunits for oxygen. A value of $n_H = 1$ would imply independent binding sites with no cooperativity (as seen in myoglobin), while $n_H  1$ would indicate negative cooperativity.\n2.  **Subunit Interaction and Allostery**: Hemoglobin is a tetramer, consisting of four subunits ($n=4$). The measured Hill coefficient $n_H$ is an empirical index of cooperativity and is always less than the total number of subunits ($n_H  n$). The value of $2.80$ is significantly greater than $1$ and approaches the theoretical maximum of $4$, indicating a very strong cooperative interaction among the subunits. This high degree of cooperativity is a direct consequence of allostery, specifically the ligand-induced transition between two distinct quaternary structures: the low-affinity Tense (T) state and the high-affinity Relaxed (R) state.\n3.  **Quaternary Structural Transition**: Oxygen binding destabilizes the T-state and favors the conformational shift to the R-state. The T-state is constrained by a network of salt bridges which are broken upon oxygenation. The transition of one subunit to the R-state upon binding oxygen lowers the energetic barrier for the other subunits to also transition to the R-state, thereby increasing their binding affinity. The value $n_H = 2.80$ quantifies the strength of this coupling between oxygen binding and the T-to-R quaternary transition.\n4.  **Physiological Significance**: This strong cooperativity results in a steep, sigmoidal binding curve, which is crucial for efficient oxygen transport. It allows hemoglobin to become nearly fully saturated with oxygen in the lungs, where $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ is high (around $13 \\ \\mathrm{kPa}$), and to release a large fraction of its bound oxygen in the peripheral tissues, where $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ is low (around $2-5 \\ \\mathrm{kPa}$). A non-cooperative protein ($n_H=1$) with the same $p_{50}$ would be far less efficient at delivering oxygen over this physiological pressure range.\n\nIn summary, the calculated Hill coefficient of $2.80$ reflects strong positive cooperativity in hemoglobin, arising from tightly coupled allosteric transitions in its quaternary structure, which is fundamental to its biological role as an oxygen transporter.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.80}$$", "id": "2960144"}]}
