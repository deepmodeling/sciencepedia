First, a description of the hydrogen-bonding pattern is required. Second, a calculation of the thermodynamic destabilization of the wobble pair relative to a canonical guanine–cytosine ($G$–$C$) pair is to be performed using the nearest-neighbor model. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution.\n\nTask $1$: Hydrogen-bonding scheme of the internal wobble $G$–$U$ pair.\n\nIn a canonical $A$-form $RNA$ duplex, both nucleobases adopt the anti-glycosidic conformation. The guanine–uracil ($G$–$U$) wobble pair is accommodated within the duplex helix by a lateral shift of the bases relative to the positions they would occupy in a standard Watson–Crick pairing, while both guanine and uracil maintain the anti-conformation. This arrangement allows for the formation of two hydrogen bonds, which is one less than the three hydrogen bonds in a canonical $G$–$C$ pair, but the same number as in an adenine–uracil ($A$–$U$) pair. Both guanine and uracil are in their predominant keto tautomeric forms.\n\nThe specific hydrogen-bonding pattern is as follows:\n$1$. A hydrogen bond forms between the guanine $N1$ hydrogen (donor) and the uracil $O2$ carbonyl oxygen (acceptor). The notation for this interaction is $G(N1–H) \\cdots O2(U)$.\n$2$. A second hydrogen bond forms between the uracil $N3$ hydrogen (donor) and the guanine $O6$ carbonyl oxygen (acceptor). The notation for this interaction is $U(N3–H) \\cdots O6(G)$.\n\nThis geometry is distinct from the Watson–Crick geometry. Notably, the $N2$ exocyclic amino group of guanine and the $O4$ carbonyl group of uracil are not involved in the hydrogen bonding between the bases and are exposed in the minor and major grooves of the helix, respectively.\n\nTask $2$: Calculation of the relative stability, $\\Delta\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{37}$.\n\nThe thermodynamic stability of an $RNA$ duplex can be estimated by summing the Gibbs free energy contributions of nearest-neighbor steps.

A positive value of $\\Delta\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{37}$ indicates that the wobble duplex is less stable (i.e., destabilized) compared to the canonical reference.\n\nThe problem specifies that only the two dinucleotide stacking steps flanking the substitution at position $3$ contribute to this difference. Let us denote the total free energy of formation for each duplex, according to the nearest-neighbor model, as the sum of contributions from all steps.\n\nFor the wobble duplex, $5'$–$C G U C A$–$3'$ paired with $3'$–$G C G G U$–$5'$, the two relevant stacking steps are:\n- Step $2\\to 3$: The stack is $5'$–$GU$–$3' / 3'$–$CG$–$5'$, with a free energy change of $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{37}(\\mathrm{GU/CG})$.\n- Step $3\\to 4$: The stack is $5'$–$UC$–$3' / 3'$–$GG$–$5'$, with a free energy change of $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{37}(\\mathrm{UC/GG})$.\n\nFor the canonical duplex, $5'$–$C G C C A$–$3'$ paired with $3'$–$G C G G U$–$5'$, the corresponding steps are:\n- Step $2\\to 3$: The stack is $5'$–$GC$–$3' / 3'$–$CG$–$5'$, with a free energy change of $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{37}(\\mathrm{GC/CG})$.\n- Step $3\\to 4$: The stack is $5'$–$CC$–$3' / 3'$–$GG$–$5'$, with a free energy change of $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{37}(\\mathrm{CC/GG})$.\n\nThe contributions from the other stacking steps ($5'$–$CG$–$3' / 3'$–$GC$–$5'$ and $5'$–$CA$–$3' / 3'$–$GU$–$5'$) and the initiation/terminal terms are identical for both duplexes.

The provided energy values and tautomer populations are physically plausible.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It requests a specific quantity—the error probability—and provides all necessary physical constants, energy differences, and populations to calculate it. The simplifying assumption to neglect misincorporation opposite the keto form makes the problem self-contained and tractable.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective scientific language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically valid, well-posed, and internally consistent under the stated assumptions. We may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of a replication error per guanine site, which in this context is the incorporation of deoxythymidine monophosphate (T) opposite a templating guanine (G). This overall error probability, $P(\\text{error})$, arises from events occurring when the template guanine is in either its keto ($G_K$) or enol ($G_E$) state. By the law of total probability, we can write:\n$$ P(\\text{error}) = P(T|G_K) P(G_K) + P(T|G_E) P(G_E) $$\nHere, $P(T|G_K)$ and $P(T|G_E)$ are the conditional probabilities of incorporating a T given the guanine is in the keto or enol form, respectively. $P(G_K)$ and $P(G_E)$ are the probabilities of finding the guanine in each state.\n\nFrom the givens, the population of the enol tautomer is $f_E = P(G_E) = 10^{-4}$. Since the guanine base must be in either the keto or enol form, the population of the keto tautomer is $f_K = P(G_K) = 1 - f_E = 1 - 10^{-4}$.\n\nA crucial part of the problem statement is the directive to \"neglect any non-tautomeric mismatch pathways (i.e., treat misincorporation across keto guanine as negligible compared to the tautomeric route)\". This is a direct instruction to set the probability of error for the keto form to zero: $P(T|G_K) \\approx 0$.\n\nApplying this simplifying assumption to our equation for the total error probability, we get:\n$$ P(\\text{error}) \\approx (0) \\cdot P(G_K) + P(T|G_E) P(G_E) = P(T|G_E) f_E $$\nThe problem is thus reduced to calculating the probability of incorporating T opposite the enol form, $P(T|G_E)$, and multiplying it by the enol population, $f_E$.\n\nThe probability of incorporating a given nucleotide is proportional to its Boltzmann weight, $\\exp(-\\Delta G/(RT))$, where $\\Delta G$ is its binding free energy. When the template is $G_E$, the polymerase active site contains dCTP and dTTP as primary competitors (assuming equal concentrations and neglecting A and G). The probability of incorporating T, given the $G_E$ template, is the ratio of the Boltzmann weight for T to the sum of the Boltzmann weights for both T and C:\n$$ P(T|G_E) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\Delta G_{T|E}/(RT))}{\\exp(-\\Delta G_{T|E}/(RT)) + \\exp(-\\Delta G_{C|E}/(RT))} $$\nwhere $\\Delta G_{T|E}$ and $\\Delta G_{C|E}$ are the free energies of binding for dTTP and dCTP opposite $G_E$, respectively.\n\nWe can simplify this expression by dividing the numerator and denominator by $\\exp(-\\Delta G_{T|E}/(RT))$:\n$$ P(T|G_E) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-(\\Delta G_{C|E} - \\Delta G_{T|E})/(RT))} $$\nThe problem states that for the enol form, dTTP is favored over dCTP by $\\Delta\\Delta G_{E} = 5.0\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. This means the free energy of binding for dTTP is lower than that for dCTP. Therefore, the difference in free energies is $\\Delta G_{C|E} - \\Delta G_{T|E} = \\Delta\\Delta G_{E}$. Substituting this into our expression gives:\n$$ P(T|G_E) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\Delta\\Delta G_{E}/(RT))} $$\nNow we combine this with the expression for the total error probability:\n$$ P(\\text{error}) = f_E \\cdot P(T|G_E) = \\frac{f_E}{1 + \\exp(-\\Delta\\Delta G_{E}/(RT))} $$\nThis is the final derived expression. The next step is to substitute the given numerical values. First, we must ensure consistent units.

We will use micromolar ($\\mathrm{\\mu M}$) and seconds ($\\mathrm{s}$).\n\nMetal concentrations:\n$[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}] = 1\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$\n$[\\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}] = 10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$\n\n**Calculation for the O-ligated phosphate ($k_{\\mathrm{obs}}^{\\mathrm{O}}$):**\nParameters:\n$K_{d}^{\\mathrm{Mg},\\mathrm{O}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$\n$K_{d}^{\\mathrm{Cd},\\mathrm{O}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 5000\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{\\mathrm{Mg},\\mathrm{O}} = 0.050\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{\\mathrm{Cd},\\mathrm{O}} = 0.005\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nWe first compute the denominator term for the fractional saturation, which we denote $D^{\\mathrm{O}}$:\n$$D^{\\mathrm{O}} = 1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{Mg},\\mathrm{O}}} + \\frac{[\\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}]}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{Cd},\\mathrm{O}}} = 1 + \\frac{1000}{100} + \\frac{10}{5000} = 1 + 10 + 0.002 = 11.002$$\nNow, we calculate the fractions of ribozyme bound to each metal:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{Mg}}^{\\mathrm{O}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]/K_{d}^{\\mathrm{Mg},\\mathrm{O}}}{D^{\\mathrm{O}}} = \\frac{10}{11.002}$$\n$$f_{\\mathrm{Cd}}^{\\mathrm{O}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}]/K_{d}^{\\mathrm{Cd},\\mathrm{O}}}{D^{\\mathrm{O}}} = \\frac{0.002}{11.002}$$\nThe observed rate is:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{obs}}^{\\mathrm{O}} = f_{\\mathrm{Mg}}^{\\mathrm{O}} \\, k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{\\mathrm{Mg},\\mathrm{O}} + f_{\\mathrm{Cd}}^{\\mathrm{O}} \\, k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{\\mathrm{Cd},\\mathrm{O}}$$\n$$k_{\\mathrm{obs}}^{\\mathrm{O}} = \\left(\\frac{10}{11.002}\\right)(0.050) + \\left(\\frac{0.002}{11.002}\\right)(0.005) = \\frac{0.5 + 0.00001}{11.002} = \\frac{0.50001}{11.002} \\approx 0.045447\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n\n**Calculation for the S-ligated phosphorothioate ($k_{\\mathrm{obs}}^{\\mathrm{S}}$):**\nParameters:\n$K_{d}^{\\mathrm{Mg},\\mathrm{S}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 5000\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$\n$K_{d}^{\\mathrm{Cd},\\mathrm{S}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{\\mathrm{Mg},\\mathrm{S}} = 0.002\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{\\mathrm{Cd},\\mathrm{S}} = 0.040\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nWe compute the denominator term $D^{\\mathrm{S}}$:\n$$D^{\\mathrm{S}} = 1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{Mg},\\mathrm{S}}} + \\frac{[\\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}]}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{Cd},\\mathrm{S}}} = 1 + \\frac{1000}{5000} + \\frac{10}{1} = 1 + 0.2 + 10 = 11.2$$\nNow, we calculate the fractions of ribozyme bound to each metal:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{Mg}}^{\\mathrm{S}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]/K_{d}^{\\mathrm{Mg},\\mathrm{S}}}{D^{\\mathrm{S}}} = \\frac{0.2}{11.2}$$\n$$f_{\\mathrm{Cd}}^{\\mathrm{S}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}]/K_{d}^{\\mathrm{Cd},\\mathrm{S}}}{D^{\\mathrm{S}}} = \\frac{10}{11.2}$$\nThe observed rate is:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{obs}}^{\\mathrm{S}} = f_{\\mathrm{Mg}}^{\\mathrm{S}} \\, k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{\\mathrm{Mg},\\mathrm{S}} + f_{\\mathrm{Cd}}^{\\mathrm{S}} \\, k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{\\mathrm{Cd},\\mathrm{S}}$$\n$$k_{\\mathrm{obs}}^{\\mathrm{S}} = \\left(\\frac{0.2}{11.2}\\right)(0.002) + \\left(\\frac{10}{11.2}\\right)(0.040) = \\frac{0.0004 + 0.4}{11.2} = \\frac{0.4004}{11.2} = 0.03575\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of Fold-Change**\n\nThe final step is to compute the fold-change in the observed rate upon sulfur substitution, defined as $F = k_{\\mathrm{obs}}^{\\mathrm{S}}/k_{\\mathrm{obs}}^{\\mathrm{O}}$.\n$$F = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{obs}}^{\\mathrm{S}}}{k_{\\mathrm{obs}}^{\\mathrm{O}}} = \\frac{0.03575}{0.045447...} \\approx 0.78663$$\nRounding to three significant figures as required by the problem:\n$$F \\approx 0.787$$\n\nThe result indicates a slight rate decrease upon sulfur substitution under these specific competitive conditions, a phenomenon resulting from the switch in the dominant, catalytically active metal ion from $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ to $\\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}$. This shift is a direct consequence of the HSAB principle: the hard acid $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ prefers the hard oxygen ligand, while the soft acid $\\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}$ prefers the soft sulfur ligand.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.787}$$", "id": "2958401"}]}
