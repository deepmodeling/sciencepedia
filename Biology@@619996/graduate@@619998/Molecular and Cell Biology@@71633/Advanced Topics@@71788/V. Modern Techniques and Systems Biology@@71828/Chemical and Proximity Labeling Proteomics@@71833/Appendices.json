This is a classic problem combining Brownian motion with a first-order chemical reaction.\n\nThe problem statement is first validated for correctness.\nGivens:\n1.  The environment is a homogeneous, isotropic, and stationary medium.\n2.  A radical is generated at a point source.\n3.  The radical undergoes Brownian motion with diffusion coefficient $D$.\n4.  The radical disappears via a first-order process with mean lifetime $\\tau$.\n5.  The labeling radius, $r$, is defined as the root-mean-square (RMS) projection of the radical’s displacement onto any one Cartesian axis at the time it disappears.\n6.  Numerical values are provided: $D = 4.0 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}^2/\\text{s}$ and $\\tau = 7.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ s}$.\n\nValidation Verdict:\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard physical model of diffusion-reaction systems, which is a valid and useful simplification for understanding proximity labeling. The given parameters are physically plausible. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**, and a solution will be derived.\n\nDerivation of the Analytical Expression for $r$:\nLet the position of the radical at time $t$ be described by the vector $\\mathbf{R}(t)$. It starts at the origin, so $\\mathbf{R}(0) = \\mathbf{0}$. The projection of its displacement onto a single Cartesian axis, say the x-axis, is $X(t)$. For one-dimensional Brownian motion starting at $X(0)=0$, the ensemble average of the displacement is zero, $\\langle X(t) \\rangle = 0$, and the mean-square displacement (MSD) at time $t$ is given by the Einstein relation:\n$$ \\langle X(t)^2 \\rangle = 2Dt $$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient.\n\nThe radical's disappearance is a first-order process. This means the probability of a single radical surviving until time $t$ is given by $S(t) = \\exp(-t/\\tau)$, where $\\tau$ is the mean lifetime. The probability density function (PDF) for the time of disappearance, $t_{dis}$, is given by the rate of decay, which is the negative derivative of the survival probability:\n$$ p(t_{dis}) = -\\frac{d}{dt_{dis}} S(t_{dis}) = -\\frac{d}{dt_{dis}} \\exp(-t_{dis}/\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\exp(-t_{dis}/\\tau) $$\nThis is the PDF of an exponential distribution for $t_{dis} \\in [0, \\infty)$.\n\nThe problem defines the labeling radius $r$ as the root-mean-square projection of the displacement at the time of disappearance. This requires us to calculate the mean-square projection, $\\langle X_{dis}^2 \\rangle$, by averaging the MSD, $\\langle X(t)^2 \\rangle$, over all possible disappearance times $t$, weighted by the probability density $p(t)$.\n$$ r^2 = \\langle X_{dis}^2 \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\langle X(t)^2 \\rangle \\cdot p(t) \\,dt $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\langle X(t)^2 \\rangle$ and $p(t)$:\n$$ r^2 = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (2Dt) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\exp(-t/\\tau) \\right) \\,dt $$\nWe can factor out the constants:\n$$ r^2 = \\frac{2D}{\\tau} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t \\exp(-t/\\tau) \\,dt $$\nThe integral $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} t \\exp(-t/\\tau) \\,dt$ represents the expected value of the exponentially distributed random variable $t$, which is known to be $\\tau$. We can confirm this using integration by parts. Let $u = t$ and $dv = \\exp(-t/\\tau) \\,dt$. Then $du = dt$ and $v = -\\tau \\exp(-t/\\tau)$.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t \\exp(-t/\\tau) \\,dt = \\left[ -t\\tau \\exp(-t/\\tau) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} - \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (-\\tau \\exp(-t/\\tau)) \\,dt $$\nThe boundary term $\\left[ -t\\tau \\exp(-t/\\tau) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty}$ evaluates to $0-0=0$. The remaining integral is:\n$$ \\tau \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-t/\\tau) \\,dt = \\tau \\left[ -\\tau \\exp(-t/\\tau) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = \\tau \\left( 0 - (-\\tau) \\right) = \\tau^2 $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $r^2$:\n$$ r^2 = \\frac{2D}{\\tau} (\\tau^2) = 2D\\tau $$\nThe labeling radius $r$ is the root of this value:\n$$ r = \\sqrt{2D\\tau} $$\nThis is the required analytical expression.\n\nNumerical Evaluation of $r$:\nWe are given the values $D = 4.0 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}^2/\\text{s}$ and $\\tau = 7.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ s}$. The units are consistent in the SI system, so the resulting $r$ will be in meters.\n$$ r = \\sqrt{2 \\times (4.0 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}^2/\\text{s}) \\times (7.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ s})} $$\n$$ r = \\sqrt{5.6 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ m}^2} $$\n$$ r \\approx 2.3664 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ m} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in nanometers ($1 \\text{ nm} = 10^{-9} \\text{ m}$) and rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ r \\approx 23.664 \\text{ nm} $$\nRounding to three significant figures yields $r \\approx 23.7 \\text{ nm}$.\n\nModeling Assumptions and Relevance:\nThe derivation relies on several key simplifying assumptions, which are standard in theoretical biophysics but must be considered in the context of a real cellular environment.\n1.  **Homogeneous and Isotropic Medium:** The cytosol is treated as a uniform fluid, where the diffusion coefficient $D$ is constant everywhere and in every direction. This is a significant simplification. The cytoplasm is highly heterogeneous and crowded with organelles and macromolecular complexes, which can lead to anomalous (sub-diffusive) and anisotropic diffusion. The actual labeling radius will be strongly affected by the local cellular architecture.\n2.  **Point Source Generation:** The radical is assumed to be generated from a mathematical point. In reality, the labeling enzyme (e.g., APEX2, TurboID) has a finite size, so radicals are generated from a surface or small volume. This assumption is reasonable if the calculated labeling radius $r$ is much larger than the size of the enzyme (typically a few nanometers).\n3.  **First-Order Decay:** The radical's lifetime is assumed to follow a simple exponential decay, meaning its quenching probability is constant and independent of its local environment. This model assumes quenching is dominated by reactions with abundant, uniformly distributed molecules (e.g., water, antioxidants). It neglects the fact that labeling of specific protein targets is a key quenching mechanism, which is dependent on the local concentration and reactivity of these targets. Thus, the model provides an estimate of the *potential* interaction sphere, not the actual distribution of labeled proteins.\n4.  **No Advection:** The cytosolic environment is assumed to be stationary. This ignores bulk flows such as cytoplasmic streaming, which could introduce a drift velocity and distort the labeling sphere into an ellipsoid, making the labeling pattern asymmetric. This assumption is generally valid for the very short timescales ($\\tau \\ll 1 \\text{ s}$) associated with reactive radicals.\n\nThese assumptions provide a tractable model that gives a fundamental length scale for the proximity labeling process. The derived radius $r=\\sqrt{2D\\tau}$ is a crucial parameter for interpreting experimental results, defining the spatial resolution of the technique, and differentiating between specific interactors and bystander proteins.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{23.7}\n$$", "id": "2938413"}, {"introduction": "Identifying true protein-protein interactions amidst a sea of cellular proteins is the central challenge in proteomics. A successful proximity labeling experiment is defined not only by the hits it generates but by the rigor of its controls.

By working through the logic of orthogonal comparisons, you will learn to build a robust experimental framework that ensures the identified interactions are specific, activity-dependent, and localized correctly within the cell.", "problem": "An investigator seeks to map the proximal proteome of a mitochondrial outer membrane bait using an engineered biotin ligase fusion that catalyzes proximity-dependent biotinylation when exogenous biotin is supplied. The experimental workflow is: transiently express bait–enzyme fusions in mammalian cells, supply biotin for a short pulse, lyse cells, enrich biotinylated proteins with streptavidin beads, and identify and quantify proteins by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) with label-free quantification (LFQ). To separate true proximity labeling from background, the investigator plans to include controls spanning four orthogonal axes: no-substrate, enzyme-dead, mislocalized enzyme, and a competition control that disables specific capture on streptavidin.\n\nFrom first principles, a protein’s identification should be attributed to bona fide proximity labeling only if it satisfies all of the following conceptual properties: (i) reaction dependence on both enzyme activity and exogenous substrate, (ii) spatial dependence on the bait’s subcellular localization, and (iii) capture dependence on streptavidin–biotin affinity rather than non-specific bead binding. Assume the following practically achievable design, each with $n=3$ biological replicates: active enzyme targeted to mitochondria with biotin added, active enzyme targeted to mitochondria without biotin, catalytically dead enzyme targeted to mitochondria with biotin, mislocalized enzyme (cytosolic) with biotin, and a competition control in which streptavidin beads are pre-blocked with a $1000$-fold molar excess of soluble biotin prior to enrichment. For each protein, the investigator will compute log$_2$ fold-changes (log$_2$FC) and two-sided $t$-tests across replicates with Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) control at $\\alpha=0.05$.\n\nWhich option specifies a minimal yet sufficient set of comparisons and quantitative decision rules that, if satisfied simultaneously by a protein, most directly justify classifying it as a bona fide proximally biotinylated neighbor of the bait under these conditions?\n\nA.

Require significant enrichment in all $4$ pairwise contrasts relative to all controls but use a single omnibus test without multiple-testing correction across proteins (raw $p \\leq 0.05$ in each contrast), to maximize sensitivity at the expense of some specificity, relying on fold-change thresholds alone to control false positives.", "solution": "The posed problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical proteomics, specifically proximity-dependent labeling. The experimental design, including the specified controls, is canonical for this class of experiment. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a logically sound conclusion. I will now proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe fundamental objective is to identify proteins that are true, specific interaction partners of a mitochondrial outer membrane bait protein. According to the problem statement, a \"bona fide proximally biotinylated neighbor\" must satisfy three conceptual properties, which are to be verified using a set of orthogonal controls. Let us define the experimental conditions for clarity:\n- **EXP**: Active enzyme, mitochondrial target, with biotin. This is the main experimental condition.\n- **C1 (No-Substrate)**: Active enzyme, mitochondrial target, without biotin.\n- **C2 (Enzyme-Dead)**: Catalytically dead enzyme, mitochondrial target, with biotin.\n- **C3 (Mislocalized)**: Active enzyme, cytosolic target, with biotin.\n- **C4 (Competition)**: EXP sample, but pulldown is performed with streptavidin beads pre-blocked with a large excess ($1000$-fold) of free biotin.\n\nNow, we evaluate the requirements for a protein to be a bona fide hit based on the three conceptual properties. For a protein quantification value $Q$, a bona fide hit must show significant enrichment in the EXP condition relative to each control, which addresses a specific source of background signal.\n\n1.  **Reaction Dependence (Property i)**: The labeling must depend on both the enzyme's activity and the presence of the substrate (exogenous biotin).\n    - **Substrate Dependence**: The protein signal must be significantly higher in EXP compared to C1. This is a comparison of $(\\text{active} + \\text{biotin})$ versus $(\\text{active} - \\text{biotin})$. A true hit must have a positive log-fold change, i.e., $\\log_2(Q_{\\text{EXP}}/Q_{\\text{C1}}) > 0$. This filters out proteins that are captured regardless of biotin addition, such as non-specific binders to the bait protein itself that co-purify.\n    - **Enzyme Activity Dependence**: The protein signal must be significantly higher in EXP compared to C2. This is a comparison of $(\\text{active} + \\text{biotin})$ versus $(\\text{dead} + \\text{biotin})$. A true hit must have a positive log-fold change, i.e., $\\log_2(Q_{\\text{EXP}}/Q_{\\text{C2}}) > 0$. This filters out endogenously biotinylated proteins (e.g., carboxylases) and contaminants that bind non-specifically to the bait-fusion protein, which would be present in both active and dead enzyme samples.\n\n2.  **Spatial Dependence (Property ii)**: The labeling must be specific to the subcellular localization of the bait protein (mitochondria).\n    - The protein signal must be significantly higher in EXP compared to C3. This is a comparison of $(\\text{mitochondrial enzyme} + \\text{biotin})$ versus $(\\text{cytosolic enzyme} + \\text{biotin})$. A true hit, being proximal to the mitochondrial bait, must have a positive log-fold change, i.e., $\\log_2(Q_{\\text{EXP}}/Q_{\\text{C3}}) > 0$. This is a crucial filter that removes promiscuous or \"bystander\" proteins that are biotinylated by enzyme that may have partially mislocalized or that are simply abundant cytosolic proteins accessible to any stray activated biotin.\n\n3.  **Capture Dependence (Property iii)**: The enrichment must be due to the specific, high-affinity interaction between the biotin tag on the protein and the streptavidin on the beads.\n    - The protein signal must be significantly higher in the standard EXP pulldown compared to the C4 pulldown, where streptavidin binding sites are blocked. A bona fide hit is biotinylated and should be efficiently captured in EXP but poorly captured in C4. Thus, its signal must be significantly depleted in the competition control, leading to a large positive log-fold change: $\\log_2(Q_{\\text{EXP}}/Q_{\\text{C4}}) > 0$. This filters out proteins that bind non-specifically to the streptavidin beads themselves, a common source of contaminants in affinity purification experiments.\n\nTherefore, a minimal and sufficient set of criteria requires a protein to show statistically significant enrichment in the EXP condition simultaneously against all four controls: C1, C2, C3, and C4. Now we evaluate the given options against this derived logic.\n\n**Option A**: This option requires only one comparison: $(\\text{active} + \\text{biotin})$ versus $(\\text{active} - \\text{biotin})$. It neglects the controls for enzyme-dependence (C2), localization-dependence (C3), and affinity capture-dependence (C4). This is grossly insufficient. It would fail to filter out endogenously biotinylated proteins, non-specific binders to the bait or beads, and proteins labeled by mislocalized enzyme. The claim that other controls are unnecessary if biotin dependence is strong is incorrect; these controls address orthogonal sources of false positives. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option B**: This option requires simultaneous satisfaction of four criteria:\n- $\\log_2\\text{FC}(\\text{active} + \\text{biotin} \\text{ versus } \\text{active} - \\text{biotin}) \\geq 1$ with FDR-adjusted $p \\leq 0.05$. This correctly tests for substrate dependence (vs. C1).\n- $\\log_2\\text{FC}(\\text{active} + \\text{biotin} \\text{ versus } \\text{dead} + \\text{biotin}) \\geq 1$ with FDR-adjusted $p \\leq 0.05$. This correctly tests for enzyme activity dependence (vs. C2).\n- $\\log_2\\text{FC}(\\text{active} + \\text{biotin} \\text{ versus } \\text{mislocalized} + \\text{biotin}) \\geq 1$ with FDR-adjusted $p \\leq 0.05$. This correctly tests for spatial dependence (vs. C3).\n- $\\log_2\\text{FC}(\\text{active} + \\text{biotin} \\text{ versus } \\text{pre-blocked streptavidin}) \\geq 2$ with unadjusted $p \\leq 0.05$. This correctly tests for capture dependence (vs. C4). A high fold-change is expected here as competition should drastically reduce signal.\n\nThis set of criteria directly and completely maps onto the three required conceptual properties using all four specified controls. The direction of every fold change is correct. The use of FDR-adjusted $p$-values is statistically appropriate for high-throughput proteomics data. The specific thresholds ($\\log_2\\text{FC} \\geq 1$ or $\\geq 2$, $p \\leq 0.05$) are reasonable and standard. This option provides a minimal yet sufficient set of rules. **Correct**.\n\n**Option C**: This option requires only one comparison: $(\\text{active} + \\text{biotin})$ versus $(\\text{mislocalized} + \\text{biotin})$. The justification provided is that \"mislocalization already eliminates proximity.\" This is flawed reasoning. While this control is essential for spatial specificity, it cannot filter out endogenously biotinylated proteins (which are present in both EXP and C3 samples) or non-specific binders to the streptavidin beads (which would bind in both conditions). Therefore, the no-substrate (C1) and enzyme-dead (C2) controls are not redundant. This approach is insufficient. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D**: This option uses all controls but inverts the logic for two key comparisons.\n- It requires $\\log_2\\text{FC}(\\text{mislocalized} + \\text{biotin} \\text{ versus } \\text{active} + \\text{biotin}) \\geq 1$. This means $\\log_2(Q_{\\text{C3}}/Q_{\\text{EXP}}) \\geq 1$, implying the protein is more abundant in the mislocalized control. This is the opposite of the desired outcome for a mitochondrial proximal protein.\n- It requires $\\log_2\\text{FC}(\\text{pre-blocked streptavidin} \\text{ versus } \\text{active} + \\text{biotin}) \\geq 2$. This means $\\log_2(Q_{\\text{C4}}/Q_{\\text{EXP}}) \\geq 2$, implying the protein is more abundant when streptavidin is blocked. This is also the opposite of the desired outcome. The premise that a true hit \"should persist\" is a complete misunderstanding of a competition-based control.\nThe logic is fundamentally flawed. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option E**: This option suggests using all four pairwise contrasts, which is good. However, it proposes using \"a single omnibus test without multiple-testing correction across proteins (raw $p \\leq 0.05$ in each contrast)\". In any 'omics' experiment such as LC-MS/MS proteomics, one performs thousands of statistical tests (one for each identified protein). Without correction for multiple hypothesis testing, a raw $p$-value threshold of $0.05$ guarantees a large number of false positives. If, for instance, $5000$ proteins are tested, one would expect $5000 \\times 0.05 = 250$ false positives by random chance alone. The problem statement itself correctly indicates the investigator's plan to use Benjamini–Hochberg FDR control, which is the standard, sound statistical procedure. Discarding this for uncorrected $p$-values is a critical methodological error that would invalidate the results by \"maximizing sensitivity\" at the cost of any reasonable specificity. **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, only Option B presents a complete, logical, and statistically sound framework for identifying bona fide hits that satisfies all the conceptual requirements laid out in the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2938504"}, {"introduction": "After a meticulously designed experiment is executed, the final step is to navigate the complex, high-dimensional dataset to extract biological meaning.

You obtain spectral counts for three candidate preys $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. The Contaminant Repository for Affinity Purification (CRAPome) provides, for each prey, the fraction $f$ of unrelated affinity purifications in which that protein is observed. Assume that a true proximity partner should be biotin-dependent (present in bait+biotin but not bait–biotin), specific to the bait (enriched over empty+biotin), and reproducible across replicates; conversely, frequent occurrence in CRAPome suggests a high prior probability of non-specific binding.

Use CRAPome to down-weight high-frequency preys as non-specific (low specificity prior), include both bait–biotin and empty+biotin as negative controls, and feed replicate spectral counts into SAINT to estimate posterior interaction probabilities (or compute MiST by integrating abundance, reproducibility, and specificity, where specificity reflects both CRAPome frequency and enrichment over controls). Apply a threshold to control FDR (for example, posterior probability or MiST cutoff giving FDR $\\leq 0.05$). Under this workflow, only $X$ is called a true proximity partner; $Y$ and $Z$ are excluded because they are frequent CRAPome contaminants and/or show lack of biotin dependence or specificity.\n\nB.

The identification of true positives must be distinguished from a background of non-specific binders and contaminants. A rigorous analysis requires a multi-faceted, statistical approach, as outlined by the principles given in the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Role of Controls**:\n    - **`bait–biotin` control**: This is a critical control for any biotin-ligase-based method. Biotinylation should only occur when exogenous biotin is added. Proteins detected in this condition are therefore not products of enzymatic labeling. They may be proteins that bind endogenously biotinylated cellular components, or they may bind directly to the bait protein or the affinity matrix (streptavidin) in a proximity-independent manner. A true proximity partner must show strong enrichment against this control, demonstrating its signal is **biotin-dependent**.\n    - **`empty+biotin` control**: This control, typically a plasmid expressing the TurboID enzyme alone or fused to a non-localizing tag (like GFP), is equally critical. It identifies proteins that are non-specifically biotinylated due to the general activity of the ligase within the cell compartment, or proteins that bind non-specifically to the streptavidin matrix. A true proximity partner must be specifically labeled as a result of being near the bait-TurboID fusion, not just any TurboID enzyme. Thus, it must show strong enrichment over the `empty+biotin` control, demonstrating its labeling is **bait-specific**.\n\n2.  **Role of Prior Probability (CRAPome)**:\n    - The Contaminant Repository for Affinity Purification (CRAPome) provides empirical frequencies ($f$) of proteins observed across a large number of unrelated affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) experiments. A protein with a high $f$ value (e.g., $f > 0.8$) is a \"frequent flyer\" that is likely to be a non-specific binder to affinity matrices or a common contaminant in sample preparation. This information can be used to establish a prior probability in a Bayesian statistical model: a high $f$ value implies a low prior probability of being a true, specific interactor for the current bait.\n\n3.  **Statistical Integration (SAINT/MiST)**:\n    - Tools like SAINT and MiST are designed to formalize this logic. They do not rely on arbitrary fold-change cutoffs or simple subtractions. Instead, they build statistical models for true interactions and for contaminants, using the data from all replicates and controls.\n    - They model the distribution of spectral counts for true interactors (expected to be high and reproducible in the bait condition) and for contaminants (modeled from the control samples).\n    - Crucially, a sophisticated implementation like SAINTexpress can directly incorporate the CRAPome frequency ($f$) to weight the prior probability of an interaction being non-specific.\n    - The output is a quantitative confidence score, such as a posterior probability (SAINT) or a MiST score, for each candidate prey. This allows for ranking all candidates by confidence.\n    - Finally, by setting a threshold on this score, one can control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) at a desired level (e.g., $FDR \\leq 0.01$ or $FDR \\leq 0.05$), providing a statistically robust list of high-confidence interactors.\n\n### Application to the Data\n- **Prey $X$**:\n    - Abundance: High and reproducible counts ($120, 98, 110$) in `bait+biotin`.\n    - Biotin-dependence: Strong enrichment over `bait–biotin` (average $\\sim109$ vs. $\\sim0.3$).\n    - Bait-specificity: Strong enrichment over `empty+biotin` (average $\\sim109$ vs. $\\sim1$).\n    - CRAPome Prior: $f_X = 0.05$, suggesting a very low prior probability of being a contaminant.\n    - **Verdict**: Prey $X$ is a classic high-confidence, true proximity partner.\n\n- **Prey $Y$**:\n    - Abundance: Low and non-reproducible counts ($15, 0, 19$) in `bait+biotin`. The $0$ count is a significant indicator of poor reproducibility.\n    - Biotin-dependence: Enrichment over `bait–biotin` (average $\\sim11.3$ vs. $0$) is present.\n    - Bait-specificity: Weak enrichment over `empty+biotin` (average $\\sim11.3$ vs. average $5$).\n    - CRAPome Prior: $f_Y = 0.70$, suggesting a high prior probability of being a contaminant.\n    - **Verdict**: Prey $Y$ is a poor candidate. The combination of non-reproducible counts, weak bait-specificity, and high contaminant prior makes it highly unlikely to be a true partner.\n\n- **Prey $Z$**:\n    - Abundance: High and reproducible counts ($40, 38, 45$) in `bait+biotin`.\n    - Biotin-dependence: No enrichment over `bait–biotin` (average $\\sim41$ vs. average $\\sim34$). The signal is not dependent on biotin addition. This is a fatal flaw for a proximity-labeling candidate.\n    - Bait-specificity: No enrichment over `empty+biotin` (average $\\sim41$ vs. average $\\sim30$). It appears at high levels even without the specific bait.\n    - CRAPome Prior: $f_Z = 0.90$, an extremely high contaminant probability.\n    - **Verdict**: Prey $Z$ is unambiguously a contaminant. Despite its high abundance in the test condition, it fails every single specificity criterion.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Use CRAPome to down-weight high-frequency preys as non-specific (low specificity prior), include both bait–biotin and empty+biotin as negative controls, and feed replicate spectral counts into SAINT to estimate posterior interaction probabilities (or compute MiST by integrating abundance, reproducibility, and specificity, where specificity reflects both CRAPome frequency and enrichment over controls). Apply a threshold to control FDR (for example, posterior probability or MiST cutoff giving FDR $\\leq 0.05$). Under this workflow, only $X$ is called a true proximity partner; $Y$ and $Z$ are excluded because they are frequent CRAPome contaminants and/or show lack of biotin dependence or specificity.**\nThis option describes the complete, modern, and statistically rigorous workflow. It correctly proposes using (1) both essential negative controls, (2) prior probabilities from CRAPome, and (3) an appropriate statistical framework (SAINT/MiST) to integrate all evidence and control the FDR. The conclusion that only prey $X$ would be identified as a true partner, while $Y$ and $Z$ would be discarded, is fully consistent with the data analysis above.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Ignore CRAPome and negative controls, rank preys by absolute spectral counts in bait+biotin only, and call $X$ and $Z$ true because they have higher counts than $Y$; classify $Y$ as a contaminant.**\nThis approach is naive and fundamentally flawed. It ignores all controls, which are essential for identifying non-specific interactions. Ranking by absolute abundance alone is notoriously unreliable and leads to a high rate of false positives. This method would incorrectly identify the contaminant $Z$ as a true partner simply because of its high spectral count.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Hard-filter the search space by removing any prey with CRAPome occurrence $f > 0.50$ and then accept any remaining prey that appears in at least one bait+biotin replicate as a true interactor; this calls $X$ true and discards $Y$ and $Z$. SAINT or MiST are unnecessary if CRAPome filtering is applied.**\nThis workflow is arbitrary and statistically unsound. While using CRAPome is good, applying a \"hard-filter\" with an arbitrary cutoff ($f > 0.50$) is crude. More importantly, it completely discards the information from the experimental controls (`bait–biotin`, `empty+biotin`), which are a direct measure of specificity in this particular experiment. The claim that SAINT/MiST are \"unnecessary\" is false; these statistical tools are precisely what is needed to integrate all sources of evidence in a non-arbitrary way.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Use SAINT with bait–biotin as the sole control, ignoring empty+biotin and CRAPome; declare $X$ and $Y$ as true because they are absent from bait–biotin and present in bait+biotin, and classify $Z$ as a contaminant because it is present in bait–biotin.**\nThis approach is incomplete. While it correctly uses the `bait–biotin` control to filter for biotin-dependence (correctly removing $Z$), it incorrectly ignores two other critical pieces of evidence: the `empty+biotin` control and the CRAPome data. By ignoring the `empty+biotin` control, it fails to assess bait-specificity. By ignoring CRAPome, it fails to incorporate the prior probability of contamination. This incomplete analysis could easily lead to misclassifying prey $Y$ as a true interactor, as it overlooks its high contaminant prior and weak enrichment over the `empty+biotin` control. A principled approach must use all available relevant data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2938432"}]}
