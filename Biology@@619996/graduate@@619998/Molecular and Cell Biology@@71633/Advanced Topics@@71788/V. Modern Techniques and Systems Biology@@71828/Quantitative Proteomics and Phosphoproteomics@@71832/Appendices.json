The analysis is based on data from a tandem mass spectrometry experiment using a concatenated target-decoy search strategy.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the calculation of the estimated PSM-level FDR. The problem states that a concatenated target-decoy search was performed with competition at the spectrum level. In this standard methodology, the number of decoy PSMs scoring at or above a threshold $t$, denoted as $D(t)$, serves as an estimate for the number of false positive target PSMs in the same score range. The total number of accepted target PSMs at this threshold is $T(t)$. The FDR is the expected ratio of false positives to the total number of accepted discoveries. Therefore, the estimated FDR at a score threshold $t$ is given by the formula:\n$$FDR(t) = \\frac{D(t)}{T(t)}$$\nThis formula applies for $T(t) > 0$. If $D(t) = 0$, the estimated FDR is $0$. The given data ensures $T(t) > 0$ for all listed thresholds.\n\nThe objective is to find the minimal score threshold $t^{\\ast}$ from the provided discrete set of scores such that the FDR is no more than $0.01$. The condition is:\n$$FDR(t^{\\ast}) \\leq 0.01$$\nIn proteomics analysis, the goal is to maximize the number of identifications for a given FDR limit. This corresponds to selecting the lowest possible score threshold (the least stringent filter) that still meets the FDR criterion. We will, therefore, calculate the FDR for each threshold, starting from the highest score, and identify the lowest score $t$ that satisfies the condition.\n\nLet us compute the FDR for each given threshold:\n- For $t=125$: $T(125)=20$, $D(125)=0$. $FDR(125) = \\frac{0}{20} = 0.0$. This satisfies $FDR \\le 0.01$.\n- For $t=122$: $T(122)=60$, $D(122)=0$. $FDR(122) = \\frac{0}{60} = 0.0$. This satisfies $FDR \\le 0.01$.\n- For $t=119$: $T(119)=95$, $D(119)=0$. $FDR(119) = \\frac{0}{95} = 0.0$. This satisfies $FDR \\le 0.01$.\n- For $t=116$: $T(116)=120$, $D(116)=1$. $FDR(116) = \\frac{1}{120} \\approx 0.00833$.

This does not satisfy $FDR \\le 0.01$.\n\nAs the score threshold $t$ decreases, the cumulative counts $T(t)$ and $D(t)$ are non-decreasing. The data shows that the ratio $D(t)/T(t)$ increases as $t$ decreases from this point onward. We can confirm this for the next point:\n- For $t=110$: $T(110)=180$, $D(110)=6$. $FDR(110) = \\frac{6}{180} = \\frac{1}{30} \\approx 0.03333$, which is greater than $0.01$.\n\nIt is evident that any threshold lower than $113$ will also result in an FDR greater than $0.01$. The set of score thresholds from the provided list that satisfy the condition $FDR(t) \\le 0.01$ is $\\{125, 122, 119, 116\\}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimal score threshold $t^{\\ast}$ that meets this criterion. This corresponds to the minimum value in the set of valid thresholds, which is $116$.\n$$t^{\\ast} = \\min(\\{125, 122, 119, 116\\}) = 116$$\nAt this threshold, the number of accepted target PSMs is $T(t^{\\ast})$, which is $T(116)$.
