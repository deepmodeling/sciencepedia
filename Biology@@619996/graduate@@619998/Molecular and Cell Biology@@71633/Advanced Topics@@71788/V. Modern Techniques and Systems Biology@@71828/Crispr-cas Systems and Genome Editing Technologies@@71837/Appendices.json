Successfully completing this problem will build your intuition for how genomic context governs the accessibility of CRISPR-Cas tools.", "problem": "A Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR-associated protein 9 (SpCas9) recognizes a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) with consensus $5^{\\prime}$-NGG-$3^{\\prime}$ on the non-target strand. Consider a long, double-stranded genomic sequence in which nucleotides are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with a guanine–cytosine (GC) content of $0.40$, and assume strand-symmetric mononucleotide frequencies such that $P(G)=P(C)$ and $P(A)=P(T)$. Under these assumptions, $P(G)+P(C)=0.40$ and $P(A)+P(T)=0.60$.\n\nStarting from the product rule for independent events and the definition of the SpCas9 PAM, derive from first principles the expected density $D$ (in sites per kilobase) of accessible SpCas9 PAMs when surveying both DNA strands.

Neglect edge effects in finite windows so that the number of possible PAM-start positions per kilobase is approximately $1000$.\n\nAs part of your derivation, justify qualitatively how the GC content controls the expected spacing of guide-eligible sites along the genome under an i.i.d. model.

All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or violations of fundamental principles. It is a standard problem in elementary bioinformatics. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected density of SpCas9 PAM sites, denoted $D$, in a long DNA sequence, surveying both strands. The density is to be expressed in sites per kilobase (kb), where $1 \\, \\mathrm{kb} = 1000$ base pairs.\n\nFirst, we must determine the probabilities of each of the four nucleotides (A, C, G, T) based on the provided information. The genomic sequence is characterized by a guanine–cytosine (GC) content of $0.40$. This is defined as the sum of the probabilities of guanine and cytosine:\n$$P(G) + P(C) = 0.40$$\nThe problem also specifies strand-symmetric mononucleotide frequencies, which implies $P(G) = P(C)$ and $P(A) = P(T)$.\nSubstituting $P(G) = P(C)$ into the GC content equation gives:\n$$2 P(G) = 0.40 \\implies P(G) = 0.20$$\nAnd therefore, $P(C) = 0.20$.\n\nThe sum of all nucleotide probabilities must be $1$:\n$$P(A) + P(T) + P(G) + P(C) = 1$$\nSubstituting the known values for $P(G)$ and $P(C)$:\n$$P(A) + P(T) + 0.40 = 1 \\implies P(A) + P(T) = 0.60$$\nUsing the strand-symmetry condition $P(A) = P(T)$:\n$$2 P(A) = 0.60 \\implies P(A) = 0.30$$\nAnd therefore, $P(T) = 0.30$.\nTo summarize, the individual nucleotide probabilities are: $P(A)=0.30$, $P(T)=0.30$, $P(G)=0.20$, and $P(C)=0.20$.\n\nA site is considered accessible for SpCas9 targeting if its PAM is present. The problem defines a \"PAM occurrence\" at a given genomic position on the forward strand by two conditions:\n1. The forward strand contains the sequence $5^{\\prime}$-NGG-$3^{\\prime}$ beginning at that position. This motif allows Cas9 to target the reverse strand.\n2. The reverse strand contains a $5^{\\prime}$-NGG-$3^{\\prime}$ PAM, which is equivalent to the forward strand containing the reverse complement sequence, $5^{\\prime}$-CCN-$3^{\\prime}$, beginning at that position. This motif allows Cas9 to target the forward strand.\n\nLet $E_{\\text{fwd}}$ be the event that a $3$-base-pair sequence on the forward strand matches the pattern $5^{\\prime}$-NGG-$3^{\\prime}$. Let $E_{\\text{rev}}$ be the event that the same $3$-base-pair sequence matches the pattern $5^{\\prime}$-CCN-$3^{\\prime}$. A site is accessible if either $E_{\\text{fwd}}$ or $E_{\\text{rev}}$ occurs. The total probability of an accessible site at any given position, $P_{\\text{total}}$, is therefore $P(E_{\\text{fwd}} \\cup E_{\\text{rev}})$.\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, this probability is:\n$$P_{\\text{total}} = P(E_{\\text{fwd}}) + P(E_{\\text{rev}}) - P(E_{\\text{fwd}} \\cap E_{\\text{rev}})$$\n\nLet the $3$-base-pair sequence be denoted $X_1X_2X_3$.\nThe event $E_{\\text{fwd}}$ corresponds to $X_2=G$ and $X_3=G$.\nThe event $E_{\\text{rev}}$ corresponds to $X_1=C$ and $X_2=C$.\nThe intersection event, $E_{\\text{fwd}} \\cap E_{\\text{rev}}$, requires both sets of conditions to be met simultaneously for the same sequence. This would mean $X_2$ must be $G$ AND $X_2$ must be $C$. As a nucleotide cannot be two different bases at once, these two events are mutually exclusive. Therefore, their intersection is the empty set, and its probability is zero:\n$$P(E_{\\text{fwd}} \\cap E_{\\text{rev}}) = 0$$\n\nThe total probability simplifies to the sum of the individual probabilities:\n$$P_{\\text{total}} = P(E_{\\text{fwd}}) + P(E_{\\text{rev}})$$\n\nNow, we calculate the probabilities of each event under the i.i.d. assumption. The probability of a sequence is the product of the probabilities of its constituent nucleotides.\nFor $E_{\\text{fwd}}$ (pattern $5^{\\prime}$-NGG-$3^{\\prime}$), where $N$ can be any nucleotide ($A$, $C$, $G$, or $T$):\n$$P(E_{\\text{fwd}}) = P(N) \\times P(G) \\times P(G)$$\nSince $P(N) = P(A) + P(C) + P(G) + P(T) = 1$, we have:\n$$P(E_{\\text{fwd}}) = 1 \\times P(G)^2 = P(G)^2$$\n\nFor $E_{\\text{rev}}$ (pattern $5^{\\prime}$-CCN-$3^{\\prime}$):\n$$P(E_{\\text{rev}}) = P(C) \\times P(C) \\times P(N) = P(C)^2 \\times 1 = P(C)^2$$\n\nSubstituting the derived nucleotide probabilities:\n$$P(E_{\\text{fwd}}) = (0.20)^2 = 0.04$$\n$$P(E_{\\text{rev}}) = (0.20)^2 = 0.04$$\n\nThe total probability of an accessible PAM site at any given position is:\n$$P_{\\text{total}} = P(E_{\\text{fwd}}) + P(E_{\\text{rev}}) = 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.08$$\n\nThe expected density $D$ is the expected number of such sites per kilobase. Assuming $1000$ possible start positions for a $3$-bp motif within a $1000$-bp window (neglecting minor edge effects), the expected number is the number of trials ($N=1000$) multiplied by the probability of success ($P_{\\text{total}}$):\n$$D = N \\times P_{\\text{total}} = 1000 \\, \\text{sites/kb} \\times 0.08 = 80 \\, \\text{sites/kb}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures, which gives $80.0$.\n\nQualitatively, the GC content of a genome directly controls the density of SpCas9 PAM sites. The relevant PAM motifs for both strands are $5^{\\prime}$-NGG-$3^{\\prime}$ and $5^{\\prime}$-CCN-$3^{\\prime}$. Both motifs are enriched in G and C nucleotides. The probability of finding an accessible site is $P_{\\text{total}} = P(G)^2 + P(C)^2$. Letting the GC content be denoted by $g$, and with the strand-symmetric assumption $P(G)=P(C)=g/2$, this probability becomes $P_{\\text{total}}(g) = (g/2)^2 + (g/2)^2 = g^2/2$. Since $P_{\\text{total}}(g)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $g$ for $g>0$, a higher GC content leads to a higher probability of a PAM occurring. A higher probability, in turn, results in a higher expected density of sites ($D \\propto g^2$) and, consequently, a smaller average spacing between guide-eligible sites along the genome. Conversely, in an AT-rich genome (low $g$), SpCas9 sites will be sparser.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{80.0}$$", "id": "2940004"}, {"introduction": "Beyond PAM availability, the success of CRISPR-Cas9 hinges on the stable formation of an RNA-DNA hybrid between the guide RNA and the target DNA strand, which forms a structure called an R-loop.

A more positive (or less negative) standard free energy of formation, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{37}$, corresponds to a thermodynamically less stable duplex. Therefore, replacing the central $GC$ base pair with an $AU$ base pair destabilizes the RNA–DNA hybrid in the seed region. The formation of a stable R-loop is a prerequisite for Cas nuclease-mediated cleavage. Based on standard transition-state reasoning, destabilizing a key reaction intermediate—in this case, the R-loop—will either increase the activation energy barrier for the overall cleavage reaction or decrease the population of the productive R-loop intermediate at equilibrium.

A DSB in highly compacted, transcriptionally silent heterochromatin is less accessible to the HDR machinery and will favor repair by NHEJ, even if the cell is in the S or G2/M phase. Conversely, a break in open, active euchromatin might exhibit a higher-than-predicted HDR rate. Thus, the identity of the genomic target site is a critical variable.\n$2$. **Competition with Alternative Repair Pathways:** The model assumes a binary choice between canonical NHEJ and HDR. In reality, other error-prone pathways exist, most notably alternative end-joining (alt-EJ), also known as microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). This pathway competes with both c-NHEJ and HDR and its relative activity varies between cell types and genomic locations.
