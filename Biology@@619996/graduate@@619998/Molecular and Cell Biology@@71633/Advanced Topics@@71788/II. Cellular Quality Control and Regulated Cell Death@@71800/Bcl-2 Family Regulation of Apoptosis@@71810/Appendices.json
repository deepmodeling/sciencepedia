The family is divided into distinct functional classes based on the presence or absence of conserved Bcl-2 Homology (BH) domains. This practice solidifies your ability to predict a protein's function—whether anti-apoptotic, pro-apoptotic effector, or BH3-only—from its structural motifs, a crucial skill for interpreting genomic and proteomic data [@problem_id:2935600].", "problem": "A research team identifies four human proteins (labeled P, Q, R, and S) with sequence features characteristic of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family. For each protein, homology-based motif annotation finds Bcl-2 Homology regions (BH1–BH4), and topology prediction identifies potential transmembrane (TM) segments. The proteins have the following properties:\n\n- Protein P: Contains BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4; has a single predicted C-terminal TM helix of approximately $20$ residues; the N-terminal region is predicted to be flexible.\n- Protein Q: Contains BH1, BH2, and BH3; lacks BH4; has a single predicted C-terminal TM helix of approximately $21$ residues.\n- Protein R: Contains only a BH3 motif; lacks BH1, BH2, and BH4; has no predicted TM segment; the polypeptide is largely intrinsically disordered.\n- Protein S: Contains only a BH3 motif; lacks BH1, BH2, and BH4; has a single predicted C-terminal TM helix of approximately $19$ residues.\n\nUsing only foundational, well-established structure–function relationships for the Bcl-2 family, classify each protein into one of three functional classes: anti-apoptotic, effector, or BH3-only. Then, select the option that both assigns the correct class to each protein and states the minimal, mechanistically grounded criteria that justify these assignments.\n\nA. P is anti-apoptotic; Q is effector; R is BH3-only; S is BH3-only. Justification: Anti-apoptotic members characteristically harbor BH1–BH4 with a single C-terminal TM and form ligand-binding grooves for BH3 helices; effectors (e.g., Bax/Bak) possess BH1–BH3 with a C-terminal TM required for mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization; BH3-only proteins contain only the BH3 motif and can be either soluble (no TM) or tail-anchored (single C-terminal TM), but lack BH1–BH2 and do not form the canonical anti-apoptotic groove.\nB. P is effector; Q is anti-apoptotic; R is BH3-only; S is effector. Justification: Any protein with a C-terminal TM is an effector; anti-apoptotic identity is determined primarily by the presence of BH4 irrespective of BH1–BH3; BH3-only proteins lack a TM.\nC. P is anti-apoptotic; Q is BH3-only; R is effector; S is BH3-only. Justification: Any protein lacking BH4 is BH3-only; any protein with a TM is an effector; anti-apoptotic proteins are those with the largest number of BH motifs.\nD. P is BH3-only; Q is effector; R is anti-apoptotic; S is BH3-only. Justification: The BH3 motif is sufficient to confer anti-apoptotic function when present alone; effectors require exactly one TM regardless of BH motif composition; anti-apoptotic proteins need not have a TM.", "solution": "We begin from foundational, widely accepted principles regarding Bcl-2 family organization and function:\n\n- The Bcl-2 family comprises three functional classes that regulate intrinsic apoptosis by controlling mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). These classes are defined by domain architecture and mechanism:\n  - Anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1) contain BH1–BH4 and a single C-terminal membrane anchor. They fold into a conserved helical bundle that creates a hydrophobic ligand-binding groove formed by BH1–BH3 to sequester BH3 helices from pro-apoptotic partners. The BH4 region is a hallmark N-terminal regulatory module associated with anti-apoptotic activity.\n  - Effector proteins (e.g., Bax, Bak, Bok) contain BH1–BH3 and a single C-terminal membrane anchor. Upon activation, they undergo conformational changes, expose their BH3 region, oligomerize in the mitochondrial outer membrane, and form pores to drive MOMP. They lack BH4.\n  - BH3-only proteins (e.g., Bid, Bim, Puma, Noxa, Bad, Bik, Bmf) contain only the BH3 motif and lack BH1, BH2, and BH4. They function as sentinels or direct activators of effectors. Topology varies: some are soluble (no TM), while several are tail-anchored with a single C-terminal TM. By definition, they do not possess the BH1–BH3 hydrophobic groove of anti-apoptotic proteins and do not share the BH1–BH3 effector fold.\n\nFrom these principles, we derive classification criteria grounded in motif architecture and topology:\n- Presence of BH1–BH4 plus a single C-terminal TM implies anti-apoptotic class.\n- Presence of BH1–BH3 (absence of BH4) plus a single C-terminal TM implies effector class.\n- Presence of only BH3 (absence of BH1, BH2, BH4) implies BH3-only class, with or without a single C-terminal TM.\n\nNow classify each protein:\n\n- Protein P: BH1, BH2, BH3, BH4 present; single C-terminal TM. This matches the anti-apoptotic archetype. Therefore, P is anti-apoptotic.\n- Protein Q: BH1, BH2, BH3 present; BH4 absent; single C-terminal TM. This matches the effector archetype (e.g., Bax/Bak). Therefore, Q is an effector.\n- Protein R: Only BH3 present; no TM; largely disordered. This matches soluble BH3-only proteins (e.g., Bad, Puma). Therefore, R is BH3-only.\n- Protein S: Only BH3 present; single C-terminal TM. This matches tail-anchored BH3-only proteins (e.g., Bik, BimL). Therefore, S is BH3-only.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\n- Option A: Assigns P as anti-apoptotic; Q as effector; R as BH3-only; S as BH3-only. The justification correctly states that anti-apoptotic proteins possess BH1–BH4 plus a C-terminal TM and bind BH3 helices in a groove; that effectors possess BH1–BH3 plus a C-terminal TM to drive MOMP; and that BH3-only proteins contain only BH3 and may be soluble or tail-anchored. This matches the derived criteria. Verdict — Correct.\n- Option B: Assigns P as effector and Q as anti-apoptotic, using “any C-terminal TM implies effector” and “BH4 alone determines anti-apoptotic” as criteria. These are incorrect: many BH3-only members have a C-terminal TM yet are not effectors, and anti-apoptotic identity requires the BH1–BH3 groove plus BH4, not BH4 alone irrespective of the rest. Verdict — Incorrect.\n- Option C: Assigns Q as BH3-only despite clear BH1–BH3, and R as effector based solely on the presence of a TM (which R lacks). It further conflates “largest number of BH motifs” with anti-apoptotic identity, ignoring the qualitative requirement for BH1–BH3 groove and BH4. Verdict — Incorrect.\n- Option D: Assigns R as anti-apoptotic despite having only BH3, and P as BH3-only despite containing BH1–BH4. It also claims effectors require exactly one TM “regardless of BH motif composition,” which is false because BH1–BH3 content is essential to effector function. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only option consistent with established structure–function relationships and the provided annotations is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2935600"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple classification, understanding a protein's precise mechanism of action is paramount. Within the BH3-only subclass, proteins can act as either \"sensitizers\" that neutralize anti-apoptotic guardians or \"direct activators\" that engage the effectors Bax and Bak. This exercise challenges you to think like a research scientist, tasking you with designing a rigorous, minimal experiment to unambiguously distinguish between these two fundamental mechanisms of apoptotic initiation [@problem_id:2935568].", "problem": "A novel Bcl-2 Homology 3 (BH3)-only protein candidate, provisionally named BH3-X, has been identified. You are tasked with discriminating whether BH3-X directly activates the effector proteins Bax/Bak to trigger mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) or instead functions solely as a de-repressor/sensitizer that neutralizes anti-apoptotic proteins (for example, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, Mcl-1) without contacting Bax/Bak. Base your reasoning on the following core definitions and facts: (i) intrinsic apoptosis culminates in MOMP executed by Bax/Bak oligomerization in the outer mitochondrial membrane; (ii) anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins bind and neutralize either Bax/Bak and/or direct activator BH3-only proteins; (iii) BH3-only proteins can be divided functionally into direct activators (for example, Bim, truncated Bid) that engage Bax/Bak to trigger their activation, and sensitizers/de-repressors (for example, Bad, Noxa) that bind anti-apoptotic proteins to liberate effectors or activators. In a minimal reconstitution, dye release from liposomes or cytochrome c release from mitochondria reports MOMP-like permeabilization; in such systems, direct activation of Bax/Bak should be detectable without anti-apoptotic proteins, whereas a purely sensitizing BH3-only protein should not produce permeabilization unless anti-apoptotic proteins are present together with an activation-competent species.\n\nWhich experimental design and quantitative/qualitative outcomes most rigorously distinguish these mechanisms?\n\nA. Reconstitute a defined liposome leakage assay using purified human Bax and cardiolipin-containing large unilamellar vesicles loaded with a self-quenching fluorophore/quencher pair (ANTS/DPX). Monitor fractional release $R(t)$ over time, fitting $R(t) = 1 - \\exp(-k t)$ to extract an apparent permeabilization rate constant $k$. Test four conditions at $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ with $[\\mathrm{lipid}] = 1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, $[\\mathrm{Bax}] = 100\\,\\mathrm{nM}$: (1) Bax alone; (2) Bax $+$ BH3-X at $200\\,\\mathrm{nM}$; (3) Bax $+$ Bcl-xL at $200\\,\\mathrm{nM}$; (4) Bax $+$ Bcl-xL at $200\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ $+$ BH3-X titrated from $50$ to $800\\,\\mathrm{nM}$. In a separate set, include a positive control direct activator, truncated Bid (tBid) at $20\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, and test Bcl-xL’s inhibition and BH3-X’s ability to restore activity. Predicted outcomes: If BH3-X is a direct activator, condition (2) yields $k \\gg 0$ and substantial $R(t)$, (1) and (3) yield $k \\approx 0$, and in (4) $k$ increases with $[\\text{BH3-X}]$ once $[\\text{BH3-X}] / [\\text{Bcl-xL}] \\gtrsim 1$, consistent with competition. In the tBid set, Bcl-xL suppresses tBid-driven leakage (reducing $k$ to $\\approx 0$), and BH3-X restores leakage by competing with Bcl-xL. If BH3-X is solely a sensitizer, (2) yields $k \\approx 0$, (4) does not induce leakage without a direct activator present, and in the tBid set BH3-X restores tBid-driven leakage in the presence of Bcl-xL in a dose-dependent manner, while BH3-X has no effect without Bcl-xL.\n\nB. Perform co-immunoprecipitation from cell lysates expressing epitope-tagged BH3-X and Bax, and quantify co-precipitation by western blot densitometry. In parallel, isolate mitochondria from wild-type cells and add BH3-X alone at $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$; score cytochrome c release by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Predicted outcomes: If BH3-X directly activates Bax/Bak, co-immunoprecipitation with Bax must be strong and addition of BH3-X to mitochondria alone must release cytochrome c; if BH3-X is a sensitizer, there will be no co-immunoprecipitation signal and no cytochrome c release even if anti-apoptotic proteins are present.\n\nC. Use isolated mitochondria from wild-type and Bax/Bak double-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Add BH3-X alone at $500\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and measure cytochrome c release after $30\\,\\mathrm{min}$ at $30\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. Predicted outcomes: If BH3-X is a direct activator, cytochrome c release should be robust in both wild-type and double-knockout mitochondria; if BH3-X is a sensitizer, cytochrome c release should be greater in double-knockout mitochondria because there are no effectors to sequester.\n\nD. Monitor Bax conformational change by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in solution using fluorescently labeled Bax at $50\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ without membranes. Add BH3-X at $0$ to $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and quantify FRET loss as a proxy for activation. Predicted outcomes: If BH3-X is a direct activator, FRET should decrease in a dose-dependent manner even in the absence of membranes; if BH3-X is a sensitizer, FRET should also decrease because the BH3 helix interacts non-specifically with Bax.\n\nChoose the option that best uses a minimal, defined system to logically separate direct activation of Bax/Bak from anti-apoptotic neutralization, together with scientifically consistent predictions across controls and titrations.", "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of apoptosis regulation by the Bcl-2 family, is well-posed, and uses objective, precise language. It provides a sound basis for a rigorous analysis of the proposed experimental designs.\n\nThe central task is to design an experiment that can unambiguously distinguish between two functional classes of BH3-only proteins: (1) direct activators, which engage Bax/Bak to induce Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilization (MOMP), and (2) sensitizers/de-repressors, which act solely by neutralizing anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-xL, thereby liberating pre-existing activators or effectors. A minimal, reconstituted system with purified components is the most rigorous approach, as it eliminates confounding variables present in cellular environments.\n\nLet us evaluate each proposed option.\n\n**Evaluation of Option A**\n\nThis option proposes a liposome permeabilization assay using a minimal set of purified components: the effector protein Bax, the candidate protein BH3-X, the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL, a known direct activator tBid (truncated Bid) as a positive control, and synthetic liposomes. Permeabilization is quantified by the rate constant $k$ derived from the fractional release of a trapped fluorophore/quencher pair.\n\nThe experimental design is comprehensive and logical.\n1.  **Test for Direct Activation:** The condition `(2) Bax + BH3-X` directly interrogates the primary hypothesis. If BH3-X is a direct activator, it will induce Bax oligomerization and membrane permeabilization, resulting in a significant rate constant ($k \\gg 0$). If BH3-X is a pure sensitizer, it does not interact with Bax to cause activation, so no permeabilization will occur ($k \\approx 0$). This is the crucial distinguishing experiment.\n2.  **Controls:** The design includes proper controls. `(1) Bax alone` serves as a baseline for spontaneous or background activity, which should be minimal ($k \\approx 0$). `(3) Bax + Bcl-xL` confirms that the anti-apoptotic protein does not induce permeabilization and may even further stabilize Bax ($k \\approx 0$).\n3.  **Test for Sensitizer Function:** The sensitizer role is to bind and neutralize anti-apoptotic proteins. The experiment using the known activator tBid (`Bax + tBid + Bcl-xL + BH3-X`) correctly tests this function. First, one establishes that Bcl-xL inhibits tBid-mediated permeabilization. Then, the addition of BH3-X should restore permeabilization if BH3-X binds to Bcl-xL, displaces tBid, and thus acts as a de-repressor. This test is valid for both a direct activator (which also must bind anti-apoptotics to be regulated) and a sensitizer.\n\nThe combination of these tests is what provides rigor.\n*   **If BH3-X is a Direct Activator:** `Bax + BH3-X` will show activity ($k \\gg 0$). BH3-X will also \"rescue\" tBid activity from Bcl-xL inhibition, because it competes with tBid for binding to Bcl-xL.\n*   **If BH3-X is a Sensitizer:** `Bax + BH3-X` will show no activity ($k \\approx 0$). However, BH3-X will rescue tBid activity from Bcl-xL inhibition.\n\nThe prediction in `(4)` that leakage is restored once $[\\text{BH3-X}] / [\\text{Bcl-xL}] \\gtrsim 1$ is consistent with a stoichiometric competition model where BH3-X sequesters Bcl-xL. The entire experimental logic is sound, uses a minimal system as requested, and provides a clear, quantitative, and unambiguous set of outcomes to distinguish the two mechanisms.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**. This option presents the most rigorous and logically sound experimental design.\n\n**Evaluation of Option B**\n\nThis option proposes using co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) from cell lysates and a cytochrome c release assay with isolated mitochondria.\n\n1.  **Co-immunoprecipitation:** This technique is performed in cell lysates, which are not a minimal system. Lysates contain a vast number of proteins, any of which could act as a bridge, mediating an indirect interaction between BH3-X and Bax. Therefore, a positive co-IP signal does not prove a direct interaction. Conversely, a transient or membrane-dependent interaction might not be captured by co-IP, leading to a false negative. This method lacks the required rigor to prove direct binding.\n2.  **Mitochondrial Assay:** The proposed experiment of adding BH3-X alone to isolated wild-type mitochondria is ambiguous. Wild-type mitochondria contain endogenous pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Cytochrome c release could occur if BH3-X is a direct activator of endogenous Bax/Bak. However, release could also occur if BH3-X is a potent sensitizer that neutralizes endogenous anti-apoptotic proteins (like Bcl-xL or Mcl-1), thereby liberating endogenous direct activators (like Bim or Bid) that were previously sequestered. This experiment cannot distinguish these two possibilities.\n3.  **Predicted Outcomes:** The prediction that a sensitizer will cause \"no cytochrome c release even if anti-apoptotic proteins are present\" is incorrect. A sensitizer's entire function is to cause release *precisely because* it can neutralize anti-apoptotic proteins that are holding the system in check.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**. The proposed methods are not performed in a minimal system, leading to ambiguity. The predicted outcomes are based on scientifically flawed reasoning.\n\n**Evaluation of Option C**\n\nThis option proposes a cytochrome c release assay using mitochondria from both wild-type and Bax/Bak double-knockout (DKO) cells.\n\nThe central flaw lies in the predicted outcomes. The problem statement correctly identifies Bax/Bak as the essential executioners of MOMP. Therefore, mitochondria lacking both Bax and Bak (DKO) are incapable of undergoing MOMP and releasing cytochrome c via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.\n\n1.  **Prediction for Direct Activator:** \"cytochrome c release should be robust in both wild-type and double-knockout mitochondria\". This is fundamentally incorrect. If BH3-X activates Bax/Bak to cause release, it can have no effect in mitochondria where Bax and Bak are absent. There should be robust release from wild-type, but zero release from DKO mitochondria.\n2.  **Prediction for Sensitizer:** \"cytochrome c release should be greater in double-knockout mitochondria\". This is also incorrect. A sensitizer acts upstream of Bax/Bak. In the absence of the effector proteins, a sensitizer is functionally inert with respect to MOMP.\n\nThe experimental design itself is reasonable (using DKO as a control is standard practice), but the interpretation and predicted outcomes described in the option are factually wrong and demonstrate a misunderstanding of the core mechanism of apoptosis.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**. The predictions violate the fundamental principles of Bcl-2-regulated apoptosis.\n\n**Evaluation of Option D**\n\nThis option suggests using Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to monitor Bax conformational change in solution, without membranes.\n\n1.  **Experimental Context:** While direct activators can induce a conformational change in Bax in solution, the full process of activation, insertion, and oligomerization is critically dependent on the mitochondrial outer membrane (or a surrogate like liposomes). An assay lacking membranes is therefore incomplete, as it does not test for the ultimate functional output: permeabilization.\n2.  **Discriminatory Power:** The key deficiency is in the predicted outcomes. It states that if BH3-X is a direct activator, FRET will decrease. It then states that if BH3-X is a sensitizer, FRET will *also* decrease, attributing this to non-specific interaction. An experiment where both hypotheses lead to the same qualitative result is, by definition, not a distinguishing test. The premise of the problem defines a sensitizer as one that works \"without contacting Bax/Bak\". The prediction in this option contradicts this definition by positing a FRET-observable interaction. Therefore, this experimental design fails to logically separate the two mechanisms as described.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**. The experiment is incomplete as it lacks membranes, and more importantly, the predicted outcomes render it non-discriminatory.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption A stands alone in its rigor. It employs a minimal, biochemically defined system, tests for the key functional output (membrane permeabilization), includes the necessary positive and negative controls, and uses a set of conditions that, when analyzed together, provides an unambiguous differentiation between a direct activator and a sensitizer mechanism.

It contains no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. A solution will now be derived.\n\n## DERIVATION OF SOLUTION\n\nThe solution to this problem requires interpreting the BH3 profiling data based on the known binding specificities of the various BH3-only peptides for the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (MCL-1, BCL-2, BCL-XL, etc.).\n\n### First Principles: BH3 Peptide Specificity\nThe BH3 peptides used in the assay have distinct binding profiles for the major anti-apoptotic proteins that function to restrain apoptosis by sequestering pro-apoptotic proteins.\n- **BIM** and **PUMA**: These are considered \"activator\" or promiscuous peptides. They bind with high affinity to all major anti-apoptotic proteins, including MCL-1, BCL-2, and BCL-XL. A strong depolarization response to these peptides indicates the cell is \"primed for apoptosis\"—meaning its mitochondria are being actively restrained by one or more anti-apoptotic proteins and are close to the threshold of undergoing mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP).\n- **NOXA**: This is a \"sensitizer\" peptide that selectively binds to and antagonizes MCL-1 and its close homolog A1. It does not effectively inhibit BCL-2 or BCL-XL. A strong response to NOXA indicates a dependency on MCL-1 for survival.\n- **BAD**: This sensitizer peptide selectively binds to and antagonizes BCL-2, BCL-XL, and BCL-W. It does not effectively inhibit MCL-1. A strong response to BAD indicates a dependency on BCL-2 and/or BCL-XL.\n- **HRK**: This sensitizer peptide selectively binds to and antagonizes BCL-XL. It does not effectively inhibit BCL-2 or MCL-1. A strong response to HRK specifically indicates a dependency on BCL-XL.\n\n### Analysis of Experimental Data\n\n**1. Baseline Condition (Before Inhibitor):**\n- BIM: $60\\%$\n- PUMA: $50\\%$\n- NOXA: $60\\%$\n- BAD: $15\\%$\n- HRK: $5\\%$\n\nThe strong responses to BIM ($60\\%$) and PUMA ($50\\%$) show that the cancer cells are significantly primed for apoptosis. The crucial observation is the very high response to NOXA ($60\\%$), which is equivalent in magnitude to the response to the pan-specific BIM peptide. Since NOXA selectively antagonizes MCL-1, this result signifies that MCL-1 is the primary anti-apoptotic protein restraining apoptosis in these cells. Conversely, the low responses to BAD ($15\\%$) and HRK ($5\\%$) indicate that BCL-2 and BCL-XL play a minimal role in cell survival under baseline conditions.\n**Conclusion at Baseline:** The cells exhibit a strong dependence on MCL-1.\n\n**2. Post-Inhibitor Condition (After MEK Inhibitor):**\n- BIM: $80\\%$\n- PUMA: $75\\%$\n- NOXA: $10\\%$\n- BAD: $55\\%$\n- HRK: $50\\%$\n\nThe responses to BIM and PUMA have increased (from $60\\%$ to $80\\%$ and $50\\%$ to $75\\%$, respectively). This indicates that treatment with the MEK inhibitor has increased the overall mitochondrial priming, pushing the cells closer to the apoptotic threshold. This is a common consequence of targeted therapies that disrupt pro-survival signaling.\n\nThe most informative changes are in the sensitizer peptide responses:\n- The response to NOXA has collapsed from $60\\%$ to $10\\%$. This demonstrates a dramatic loss of MCL-1 dependence. This is consistent with the known biology where MEK/ERK signaling can stabilize MCL-1 protein; inhibiting MEK leads to MCL-1 degradation, thus removing it as a key survival factor.\n- The response to BAD has increased substantially from $15\\%$ to $55\\%$. Since BAD targets BCL-2 and BCL-XL, this indicates a newly acquired dependence on one or both of these proteins.\n- The response to HRK has increased dramatically from $5\\%$ to $50\\%$. Since HRK is selective for BCL-XL, this provides strong, specific evidence that the cells have become critically dependent on BCL-XL for survival. The large increase in the BAD response is consistent with this, as BAD also targets BCL-XL.\n\n**Conclusion after Inhibitor:** The cells have lost their dependence on MCL-1 and have acquired a strong, new dependence on BCL-XL.\n\n**3. Synthesis and Therapeutic Strategy:**\nThe MEK inhibitor induces a shift in anti-apoptotic dependence, moving from a reliance on MCL-1 to a reliance on BCL-XL. This phenomenon, known as \"dependency switching,\" is a common mechanism of acquired resistance but also presents a therapeutic opportunity. A rational combination therapy would pair the MEK inhibitor with a drug that targets the newly acquired vulnerability. In this case, the target should be BCL-XL.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Shift from myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1) dependence to B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) dependence; combine MEK inhibitor with venetoclax (BCL-2 inhibitor).**\nThe initial part, a shift from MCL-1 dependence, is correct. The endpoint, however, is not the most precise description. While the BAD peptide response increase ($15\\% \\to 55\\%$) is consistent with BCL-2 dependence, the dramatic HRK peptide response increase ($5\\% \\to 50\\%$) specifically and strongly implicates BCL-XL. Targeting only BCL-2 with venetoclax would likely be suboptimal. **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Shift from myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1) dependence to B-cell lymphoma extra-large (BCL-XL) dependence; combine MEK inhibitor with A-1331852 (BCL-XL inhibitor).**\nThis statement accurately describes the observed shift. The loss of MCL-1 dependence is shown by the NOXA data. The gain of BCL-XL dependence is strongly supported by the dramatic increase in response to the BCL-XL-selective peptide HRK. The proposed combination therapy, using a MEK inhibitor with a BCL-XL inhibitor (A-1331852 is a known BCL-XL inhibitor), is a perfectly rational strategy to exploit this acquired vulnerability. **Correct**.\n\n**C. Increased myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1) dependence after kinase inhibition; combine MEK inhibitor with S63845 (MCL-1 inhibitor).**\nThis is directly contradicted by the data. The response to the MCL-1-selective peptide NOXA plummeted from $60\\%$ to $10\\%$, indicating a loss, not an increase, of MCL-1 dependence. Combining with an MCL-1 inhibitor (like S63845) would be illogical. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. No meaningful change in anti-apoptotic dependence; add a pan-caspase inhibitor to mitigate excessive apoptosis while continuing MEK inhibition.**\nThis statement is false on two counts. First, there was a clear, dramatic, and meaningful shift in anti-apoptotic dependence, as shown by the large changes in the NOXA, BAD, and HRK responses. Second, the therapeutic suggestion is nonsensical. The goal of cancer therapy is to induce apoptosis in malignant cells. Adding a pan-caspase inhibitor would block apoptosis and antagonize the intended effect of the cancer treatment. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2935493"}]}
