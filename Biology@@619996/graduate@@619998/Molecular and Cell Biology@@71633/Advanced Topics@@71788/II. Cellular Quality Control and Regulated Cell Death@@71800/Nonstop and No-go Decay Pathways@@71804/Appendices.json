In No-Go Decay (NGD), this initial recognition involves sensing ribosomes that have stalled and collided on an mRNA template. This exercise explores the crucial molecular signal that flags these ribosomes for intervention: the polyubiquitination of specific ribosomal proteins, such as uS10. This practice challenges you to think like an experimentalist, designing rigorous controls to prove that this post-translational modification is the specific trigger, while ruling out confounding global effects on translation from your experimental manipulations [@problem_id:2957597].", "problem": "A central premise of molecular biology is that messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) is translated by ribosomes into protein, and that cells possess co-translational quality control pathways to detect and resolve aberrant translation. In eukaryotes, No-Go Decay (NGD) targets mRNAs on which ribosomes stall irreversibly during elongation. A well-established, foundational mechanistic fact is that collided ribosomes are recognized by specific ubiquitin E3 ligases (for example, Hel2 in yeast or ZNF598 in mammals), which polyubiquitinate lysine residues on small subunit proteins including uS10 and uS3. Ubiquitination of uS10 is required to recruit downstream factors (for example, the Ribosome Quality Control Trigger complex, endonucleases such as Cue2 in yeast, and the Ski complex with the exosome) that cleave the mRNA near the stall and degrade the resulting fragments, thereby restoring ribosome homeostasis.\n\nYou engineer a haploid yeast strain in which all known Hel2-target lysines on chromosomal uS10 are replaced with arginines (a K$\\to$R mutant), preserving positive charge while removing the ubiquitin acceptor functionality at those positions.

If NGD is rescued, the defect must be due to a global translation problem rather than loss of ubiquitination.", "solution": "The problem statement must first be validated for scientific soundness and logical consistency.\n\n**Step 1: Extraction of Givens**\n- **Biological Process:** No-Go Decay (NGD), a co-translational quality control pathway in eukaryotes.\n- **Organism:** Haploid yeast.\n- **NGD Mechanism:**\n    1. Ribosomes stall irreversibly.\n    2. Collided ribosomes are recognized by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Hel2.\n    3. Hel2 polyubiquitinates lysine (K) residues on small ribosomal subunit proteins, including uS10.\n    4. Ubiquitination of uS10 is **required** to recruit downstream factors (e.g., Cue2 endonuclease, RQT complex, Ski/exosome).\n    5. These factors cleave the mRNA and degrade the fragments.\n- **Experimental Mutation:** A K$\\to$R mutant strain is created, where all known Hel2-target lysines on the chromosomal uS10 protein are replaced with arginines. Arginine (R) preserves positive charge but cannot be ubiquitinated.\n- **Experimental Assay:** A two-reporter system with a test mRNA containing a stall-inducing element and a control mRNA without it.\n- **Defined Metric:** $E_{\\mathrm{NGD}}$, the qualitative NGD efficiency, is the probability of mRNA cleavage and decay following a ribosome stall.\n- **Question:** Predict the effect of the uS10 K$\\to$R mutation on $E_{\\mathrm{NGD}}$ and propose a specific control to distinguish a specific NGD defect from a global translation defect.\n\n**Step 2: Validation Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded. The description of the NGD pathway—involving ribosome stalling, collision sensing by Hel2/ZNF598, ubiquitination of ribosomal proteins like uS10, and recruitment of downstream cleavage and decay machinery like Cue2 and the exosome—accurately reflects established knowledge in the field of molecular biology. The experimental design, using a K$\\to$R substitution to ablate a post-translational modification site while preserving charge, is a standard and rigorous biochemical approach. The use of reporter constructs to assay a specific pathway is also a cornerstone of genetic and molecular analysis. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a logical conclusion. It does not violate any criteria for validity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe problem asks for two things: a prediction of the effect of the uS10 K$\\to$R mutation on NGD efficiency ($E_{\\mathrm{NGD}}$) and a proposal for a control experiment.\n\n**Part 1: Prediction of the Effect on $E_{\\mathrm{NGD}}$**\nThe problem explicitly states a foundational mechanistic fact: \"Ubiquitination of uS10 is required to recruit downstream factors ... that cleave the mRNA near the stall\". The mutation introduced replaces lysine (K), the substrate for ubiquitination, with arginine (R). While arginine is also positively charged, its side chain lacks the terminal primary amine ($\\epsilon$-amino group) that forms an isopeptide bond with the C-terminus of ubiquitin. Therefore, the uS10 K$\\to$R mutant protein cannot be ubiquitinated by Hel2.\n\nGiven that uS10 ubiquitination is a necessary prerequisite for the recruitment of the NGD endonuclease Cue2 and other decay factors, its abrogation will block the NGD pathway at a critical step. If the endonucleolytic machinery cannot be recruited to the stalled ribosome, the mRNA will not be cleaved. According to the definition provided, $E_{\\mathrm{NGD}}$ is the probability of this cleavage-and-decay event. It follows directly that blocking a required step in this process will lead to a decrease in its efficiency.\n\nTherefore, it is predicted that $E_{\\mathrm{NGD}}$ will decrease.\n\n**Part 2: Design of a Control Experiment**\nThe mutation is in a core component of the ribosome, uS10. Such a mutation could have pleiotropic effects, potentially including a general impairment of translation. A defect observed on the stall-inducing reporter could be misinterpreted as a specific NGD failure when it is, in fact, a consequence of a global translation defect. The control experiment must specifically distinguish between these two possibilities.\n\nA robust control strategy involves three components:\n1.  **Assessing the specific pathway (NGD):** This is done using the stall-inducing reporter. A defect in NGD would manifest as an accumulation of the full-length stall-reporter mRNA and a concomitant reduction in the characteristic NGD-mediated cleavage fragments. This is typically visualized and quantified using a Northern blot.\n2.  **Assessing general translation of a normal mRNA:** The matched no-stall control reporter serves this purpose. If this reporter is translated and expressed at levels comparable to the wild-type strain, it suggests that basic translation elongation and termination on an unobstructed mRNA is not grossly impaired.\n3.  **Assessing global protein synthesis rate:** To provide a comprehensive picture of the cell's translational health, a direct measure of the total rate of protein synthesis is required. The Surface Sensing of Translation (SUnSET) assay is the modern standard for this. It involves treating cells with puromycin, a tRNA analog that incorporates into nascent polypeptide chains. The amount of incorporated puromycin, detected by Western blot using a specific antibody, is directly proportional to the global rate of translation.\n\nIf the uS10 K$\\to$R mutation causes a specific defect in NGD, the expected experimental outcome would be:\n- Normal or near-normal output from the no-stall reporter.\n- Normal or near-normal levels of puromycin incorporation (SUnSET signal).\n- A clear defect in the processing of the stall-reporter (accumulation of full-length transcript, loss of cleavage products).\n\nThis set of results would compellingly demonstrate that the primary defect is in the NGD quality control pathway, not in the general capacity of the cell to translate proteins.\n\n**Evaluation of Provided Options**\n\n**A. $E_{\\mathrm{NGD}}$ decreases because loss of ubiquitin on uS10 prevents recruitment of NGD factors to collided ribosomes; as a control, quantify a matched no-stall reporter and global translation by puromycin incorporation (SUnSET) in parallel. If the no-stall reporter output and puromycin labeling are unchanged while the stall reporter mRNA accumulates with fewer cleavage fragments by Northern blot, the phenotype reflects loss of uS10 ubiquitination rather than a global translation defect.**\n- **Prediction and Rationale:** The prediction that $E_{\\mathrm{NGD}}$ decreases and the reasoning provided (prevention of NGD factor recruitment) are correct, as derived above.\n- **Control Strategy:** The proposed controls—using a no-stall reporter and a puromycin incorporation assay (SUnSET)—and the interpretation of the results are precisely what is required to distinguish a specific NGD defect from a global translation defect. The description of the expected Northern blot result (accumulation of stall reporter mRNA, fewer cleavage fragments) is also correct.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option is entirely consistent with our rigorous derivation.\n\n**B. $E_{\\mathrm{NGD}}$ increases because K$\\to$R substitutions reduce ribosome collisions; as a control, add cycloheximide to equalize elongation rates between strains. Persistence of the phenotype after cycloheximide would indicate a ubiquitination-specific mechanism.**\n- **Prediction and Rationale:** The prediction that $E_{\\mathrm{NGD}}$ increases is incorrect. The reasoning that K$\\to$R substitutions reduce ribosome collisions is unsubstantiated speculation.\n- **Control Strategy:** The use of cycloheximide, a global translation inhibitor, is not the most direct or clean way to assess global translation competence in this context. It complicates the interpretation of stalling dynamics.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $E_{\\mathrm{NGD}}$ is unchanged because K$\\to$R conserves charge; as a control, show a similar polysome profile between wild type and mutant to conclude no effect on NGD.**\n- **Prediction and Rationale:** The prediction that $E_{\\mathrm{NGD}}$ is unchanged is incorrect. It wrongly assumes that charge conservation is sufficient for function, ignoring the critical role of the lysine side-chain chemistry in accepting ubiquitin.\n- **Control Strategy:** A polysome profile assesses the bulk distribution of ribosomes on mRNA, but it is often not sensitive enough to detect defects in a specific quality control pathway like NGD, which may affect only a small subset of translating ribosomes. It is not a definitive control for NGD function.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $E_{\\mathrm{NGD}}$ decreases; as a control, rescue the phenotype by overexpressing catalytically dead Hel2, which should restore NGD if the defect is global and not due to ubiquitination.**\n- **Prediction and Rationale:** The prediction that $E_{\\mathrm{NGD}}$ decreases is correct.\n- **Control Strategy:** The proposed control is illogical. Overexpression of a catalytically *dead* E3 ligase (Hel2) would act as a dominant-negative inhibitor of the pathway. It can, under no circumstances, \"restore\" NGD. This experiment makes no scientific sense.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. $E_{\\mathrm{NGD}}$ decreases; as a control, express wild-type uS10 from a plasmid to restore function. If NGD is rescued, the defect must be due to a global translation problem rather than loss of ubiquitination.**\n- **Prediction and Rationale:** The prediction that $E_{\\mathrm{NGD}}$ decreases is correct.\n- **Control Strategy:** The experiment proposed (plasmid-based rescue with wild-type uS10) is a valid genetic complementation test. However, the interpretation is fatally flawed. If providing the wild-type, ubiquitinatable protein rescues the NGD defect, it *proves* that the defect was specifically due to the loss of the uS10 lysine residues and their ubiquitination, *not* a global translation problem. The option states the exact opposite conclusion.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a thorough analysis, only option A presents a correct prediction, a valid rationale, and a scientifically rigorous and logically sound control strategy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2957597"}, {"introduction": "Once a stalled ribosome is identified, it must be efficiently removed to rescue the trapped translational machinery and allow for the degradation of the faulty mRNA.

It requires an application of fundamental principles of molecular biology concerning ribosome quality control to predict the outcome of a defined genetic experiment. We shall proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe central process is the resolution of stalled ribosomes during no-go decay, a critical pathway in ribosome-associated quality control. The problem provides the sequence of events in a wild-type eukaryote:\n$1$. A ribosome stalls on a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) molecule, for example at a strong secondary structure, forming a stalled $80\\mathrm{S}$ ribosome complex.\n$2$. If the stall persists, trailing ribosomes may collide with the stalled one, forming disomes ($80\\mathrm{S}$–$80\\mathrm{S}$ complexes) and heavier polysomes.\n$3$. The rescue factor complex Pelota–Hbs1 recognizes the stalled ribosome.\n$4$. The Adenosine Triphosphatase (ATPase) ABCE1 is recruited.\n$5$. ABCE1 hydrolyzes Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) to power the dissociation (splitting) of the stalled $80\\mathrm{S}$ ribosome into its subunits: a $40\\mathrm{S}$ subunit and a $60\\mathrm{S}$ subunit.\n$6$. The $60\\mathrm{S}$ subunit retains the nascent polypeptide chain attached to a transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA), forming a $60\\mathrm{S}$–peptidyl–tRNA complex. This complex is the substrate for subsequent quality control steps.\n\nThe experiment introduces a mutant form of ABCE1 that is \"defective in ATP hydrolysis\" but retains \"intact ribosome binding.\" This is a classic dominant-negative mutation strategy. The mutant protein will bind to its target—the stalled ribosome—but will be unable to perform its catalytic function. The system will be trapped at the step immediately preceding ATP hydrolysis.\n\nLet us analyze the effect of this molecular block on the ribosomal species measured by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, which separates particles based on their size and shape, producing an absorbance profile at a wavelength of $A_{254}$.\n\nThe key reaction catalyzed by wild-type ABCE1 is:\n$$ \\text{Stalled } 80\\mathrm{S} \\text{ Ribosome} + \\text{ATP} \\xrightarrow{\\text{ABCE1}} 40\\mathrm{S} \\text{ Subunit} + 60\\mathrm{S}\\text{–peptidyl–tRNA Complex} + ADP + \\mathrm{P_i} $$\nIn the presence of the ATPase-deficient ABCE1 mutant, this reaction is blocked.\n$$ \\text{Stalled } 80\\mathrm{S} \\text{ Ribosome} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Mutant ABCE1}} \\text{Trapped } 80\\mathrm{S}\\text{–ABCE1 Complex} \\quad (\\text{No Splitting}) $$\n\nWe now predict the changes in the sucrose gradient profile by comparing the mutant to the wild type under conditions where no-go decay is induced.\n\n- **$80\\mathrm{S}$ Monosomes**: Stalled ribosomes that have not yet been collided with exist as $80\\mathrm{S}$ monosomes. In wild-type cells, these are substrates for the ABCE1-mediated splitting pathway and are thus continuously cleared. In the mutant cells, this clearance pathway is non-functional. Consequently, stalled $80\\mathrm{S}$ monosomes will accumulate because their rate of formation is no longer balanced by a rate of clearance. This leads to a predicted **increase** in the $80\\mathrm{S}$ monosome peak.\n\n- **Disomes**: Disomes form from the collision of a trailing ribosome with a stalled ribosome. In the mutant cells, the primary stalled ribosome is not cleared, leading to a persistent roadblock on the mRNA. This greatly increases the likelihood of ribosome collisions and queuing. Therefore, the population of disomes (and heavier stalled polysomes) is expected to **increase** significantly.\n\n- **$60\\mathrm{S}$–peptidyl–tRNA Complexes**: These complexes are the *product* of the ABCE1-mediated ribosome splitting reaction. Since the mutant ABCE1 cannot catalyze this reaction, the formation of $60\\mathrm{S}$–peptidyl–tRNA complexes from stalled $80\\mathrm{S}$ ribosomes will be drastically reduced or eliminated. Therefore, the amount of these species, which contribute to the absorbance in the $60\\mathrm{S}$ region of the gradient, is predicted to **decrease** markedly.\n\nSummary of prediction: an accumulation of the substrates for splitting ($80\\mathrm{S}$ monosomes and disomes) and a depletion of the product ($60\\mathrm{S}$–peptidyl–tRNA complexes).\n\nNow, we evaluate the provided options against this deduction.\n\n**A. Increased $80\\mathrm{S}$ monosomes and disomes, with a marked decrease in $60\\mathrm{S}$–peptidyl–tRNA complexes.**\nThis statement precisely matches our derived prediction. The block in ribosome splitting causes the precursor stalled complexes ($80\\mathrm{S}$ and disomes) to accumulate, while the product of the reaction ($60\\mathrm{S}$–peptidyl–tRNA) is not formed.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Decreased $80\\mathrm{S}$ monosomes, increased disomes, and increased $60\\mathrm{S}$–peptidyl–tRNA complexes.**\nThis is incorrect. The accumulation of stalled $80\\mathrm{S}$ monosomes is expected, not a decrease. The increase in $60\\mathrm{S}$–peptidyl–tRNA complexes is also incorrect, as their synthesis is blocked.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Decreased $80\\mathrm{S}$ monosomes and disomes, with a marked increase in $60\\mathrm{S}$–peptidyl–tRNA complexes.**\nThis describes the opposite scenario, perhaps one where the splitting reaction is hyper-activated. It is patently illogical for a catalytically dead mutant. Both premises are incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Little change in $80\\mathrm{S}$ monosomes and disomes, but a selective increase in $60\\mathrm{S}$–peptidyl–tRNA complexes due to trapping of nascent chains on $60\\mathrm{S}$.**\nThis is incorrect. Blocking a major clearance pathway for one of the most abundant molecular machines in the cell cannot result in \"little change\". Furthermore, the claim of an *increase* in $60\\mathrm{S}$–peptidyl–tRNA is contrary to the mechanism; these complexes cannot be formed if the $80\\mathrm{S}$ ribosome is not split.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2957616"}, {"introduction": "In concert with rescuing the ribosome, the cell must eliminate the aberrant messenger RNA that caused the stall in the first place, preventing the continued synthesis of truncated, potentially toxic proteins. This practice uses the related Nonstop Decay (NSD) pathway as a model to explore the machinery responsible for 3'-to-5' degradation, focusing on the central roles of the Ski complex and the exosome. Successfully solving this problem requires you to think strategically about experimental design, particularly how to devise a molecular probe for a Northern blot that can specifically visualize the fleeting intermediates of an active decay pathway [@problem_id:2957573].", "problem": "A research team investigates how defective translation termination triggers cytoplasmic ribonucleolytic quality control. They use Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains carrying a reporter messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) engineered to lack a stop codon (a canonical substrate for Nonstop Decay (NSD)). The reporter has a defined open reading frame (ORF) and a downstream untranslated region (UTR) that is normally polyadenylated. The team plans to probe RNA species by northern blot under three genetic backgrounds: wild type, deletion of the gene encoding Ski Seven (Ski7), and deletion of the gene encoding Ski Two (Ski2). As foundational facts, use only the following: the Central Dogma (deoxyribonucleic acid to mRNA to protein); translation normally terminates at a stop codon recognized by release factors; in the absence of a stop codon, ribosomes translate into the polyadenosine tail and stall near the mRNA $3'$ end; NSD uses Ski Seven (Ski7) to recognize ribosome-stalled nonstop substrates and to recruit the cytoplasmic exosome, a $3'$ to $5'$ exonuclease complex; the Ski complex, including the Ski Two (Ski2) helicase, is required to channel and unwind mRNA into the exosome for processive $3'$ to $5'$ decay; $5'$ to $3'$ decay by Xrn One (Xrn1) is not the defining route for NSD substrates.\n\nThe team must decide what RNA intermediates will accumulate in each mutant and how to design a northern blot probe to visualize nonstop decay intermediates specifically. They have three probe placements to consider: within the $5'$ portion of the ORF (far from the $3'$ end), within the $3'$ UTR, or an oligo(deoxythymidine) probe that hybridizes to the polyadenosine tail.\n\nWhich option best predicts the effects of deleting Ski7 or Ski2 on the accumulation of nonstop decay intermediates and proposes a probe placement that will visualize those intermediates specifically?\n\nA. Deleting Ski7 prevents recognition of nonstop substrates by the exosome, stabilizing predominantly full-length polyadenylated nonstop mRNAs; deleting Ski2 impairs exosome processivity on recognized substrates, causing accumulation of $3'$-truncated decay intermediates that have lost part or all of the $3'$ UTR. Therefore, a probe within the $5'$ ORF will detect the ladder of $3'$-truncated NSD intermediates in the Ski2 deletion, whereas a $3'$ UTR probe or an oligo(deoxythymidine) probe will underreport these intermediates.\n\nB. Deleting Ski7 causes accumulation of $3'$-truncated intermediates because the exosome is recruited but cannot translocate; deleting Ski2 stabilizes full-length nonstop mRNA because the exosome is not recruited. Therefore, a probe within the $3'$ UTR is optimal to detect NSD intermediates in both mutants.\n\nC. Both Ski7 and Ski2 deletions divert decay to $5'$ to $3'$ exonucleolysis by Xrn One (Xrn1), yielding predominantly $5'$-truncated intermediates. Therefore, a $3'$ UTR probe is required to visualize the major intermediates in both mutants.\n\nD. Deleting Ski7 primarily switches degradation to No-Go Decay (NGD) endonucleolysis within the coding region, producing internal fragments that are best detected by a probe centered on the former stop-codon region; deleting Ski2 has no major effect on the spectrum of nonstop intermediates because the exosome does not engage ribosome-bound RNA in NSD.", "solution": "Begin with the stated fundamentals. Translation normally terminates when a stop codon enters the ribosomal A-site and is recognized by release factors; without a stop codon, translation proceeds into the polyadenosine tail, producing a polylysine stretch that impairs elongation and leaves the ribosome stalled near the mRNA $3'$ end. Nonstop Decay (NSD) is a cytoplasmic mRNA surveillance pathway in which Ski Seven (Ski7), a factor with similarity to translational GTPases, recognizes the stalled ribosome at the aberrant $3'$ end and recruits the cytoplasmic exosome. The exosome degrades RNA in the $3'$ to $5'$ direction. For efficient and processive engagement with structured or ribosome-associated RNA, the exosome relies on the Ski complex, notably the Ski Two (Ski2) RNA helicase, which helps feed the $3'$ end into the exosome’s channel.\n\nFrom these facts, derive the expected species patterns upon deleting Ski Seven (Ski7) versus Ski Two (Ski2):\n\n- If Ski Seven is deleted, NSD recognition is impaired. The exosome is not efficiently recruited to nonstop substrates at stalled ribosomes. Consequently, the characteristic $3'$ to $5'$ degradation of nonstop mRNAs is strongly reduced. The most parsimonious expectation is stabilization of the full-length, polyadenylated nonstop mRNA, because the defining NSD entry step is missing. While other decay pathways exist in the cell, the problem statement directs us to treat $5'$ to $3'$ decay by Xrn One (Xrn1) as not the defining route for nonstop substrates. Therefore, the predominant species that accumulates in Ski Seven deletion is the full-length nonstop mRNA, retaining the $3'$ UTR and polyadenosine tail.\n\n- If Ski Two is deleted, Ski Seven can still recognize the substrate and recruit the exosome, but the exosome’s ability to processively degrade is impaired due to loss of the Ski Two helicase activity that threads the RNA into the exosome. Under these conditions, the exosome may initiate but stall, leading to accumulation of $3'$-truncated intermediates that have been partially degraded from the $3'$ end. These intermediates are expected to have lost all or part of the $3'$ UTR (and often the polyadenosine tail), but they retain the $5'$ coding region and upstream sequences because degradation proceeds $3'$ to $5'$.\n\nGiven these predicted species, design northern blot probe placement:\n\n- A probe within the $5'$ portion of the ORF will hybridize to any RNA that still contains the $5'$ coding region, including both full-length transcripts and $3'$-truncated intermediates produced by $3'$ to $5'$ decay. Thus, it is well-suited to visualize the ladder or smear of $3'$-truncated intermediates that accumulate when Ski Two is deleted.\n\n- A probe within the $3'$ UTR will only detect species that still contain the $3'$ UTR. It will report full-length transcripts but will miss or underreport $3'$-truncated NSD intermediates that have lost the $3'$ UTR.\n\n- An oligo(deoxythymidine) probe that hybridizes to polyadenosine tails requires the presence of a polyadenosine tail. $3'$ to $5'$ exonucleolysis by the exosome removes the polyadenosine tail early, so $3'$-truncated NSD intermediates will generally lack detectable polyadenosine tails. Thus, an oligo(deoxythymidine) probe will underrepresent NSD intermediates.\n\nNow evaluate each option:\n\nA. This option states that deleting Ski Seven stabilizes full-length, polyadenylated nonstop mRNA (consistent with loss of NSD entry), and that deleting Ski Two causes accumulation of $3'$-truncated intermediates (consistent with impaired exosome processivity on Ski Seven–recognized substrates). It further recommends a $5'$ ORF probe to visualize the truncated ladder in the Ski Two deletion, with the expectation that $3'$ UTR or oligo(deoxythymidine) probes will underreport these intermediates. This matches the derived reasoning: $3'$-truncated species retain the $5'$ coding region but lose the $3'$ UTR and polyadenosine tails. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. This option inverts the roles of Ski Seven and Ski Two. It claims that deleting Ski Seven yields $3'$-truncated intermediates because exosome recruitment occurs but translocation fails; however, Ski Seven is the recruiter, so its deletion prevents efficient exosome engagement. It also claims that deleting Ski Two stabilizes full-length nonstop RNA because exosome is not recruited; Ski Two is not the recruiter, so this is inconsistent. It then proposes a $3'$ UTR probe to detect intermediates, which would miss $3'$-truncated species. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. This option asserts that both deletions divert decay to $5'$ to $3'$ exonucleolysis by Xrn One (Xrn1), producing $5'$-truncated intermediates detected with a $3'$ UTR probe. The foundational facts provided specify that $5'$ to $3'$ decay by Xrn One (Xrn1) is not the defining route for NSD substrates. Moreover, nonstop-triggered recognition and decay are characterized by $3'$ to $5'$ exosome activity; $5'$ truncation is not the expected hallmark. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. This option claims that deleting Ski Seven primarily switches the pathway to No-Go Decay (NGD) endonucleolysis and that deleting Ski Two has no major effect on nonstop intermediates. While interplay between pathways exists in cells, the provided base emphasizes NSD as Ski Seven–dependent $3'$ to $5'$ decay. A wholesale switch to NGD as the primary route and a negligible role for Ski Two contradict the core mechanistic expectations. The probe recommendation (centered at the former stop codon) is not aligned with the need to detect $3'$-truncated RNAs produced by exosome action. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the best option is A. It correctly predicts that Ski Seven deletion stabilizes full-length nonstop mRNA, Ski Two deletion accumulates $3'$-truncated NSD intermediates, and a $5'$ ORF probe is optimal to visualize the NSD intermediates specifically, whereas $3'$ UTR or oligo(deoxythymidine) probes would underreport them.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2957573"}]}
