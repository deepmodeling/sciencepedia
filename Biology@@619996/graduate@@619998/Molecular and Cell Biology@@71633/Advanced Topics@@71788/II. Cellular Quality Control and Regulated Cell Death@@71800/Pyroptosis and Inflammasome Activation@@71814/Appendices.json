High cooperativity ($n > 1$) leads to a sigmoidal, switch-like response, where the system transitions sharply from \"off\" (inhibited) to \"on\" (permissive).\nThe macro-dissociation constant, $K_{d}$, sets the **threshold** for activation. The concentration for half-activation is $[\\text{K}^+]_{1/2} = (K_d)^{1/n}$. This means $K_d$ tunes the operating point of the switch. For the inflammasome to respond to a physiological drop in potassium from ca. $140$ mM to ca. $70$ mM, its threshold $[\\text{K}^+]_{1/2}$ must be positioned within this range.\nThe maximal rate constant, $k_{0}$, sets the **amplitude** of the response. It represents the maximum possible rate of activation when inhibitory potassium is absent. It scales the output of the switch, determining the strength of the signal propagated downstream upon activation, but does not influence the relative shape or threshold of the activation curve.\nIn conclusion, for an effective physiological switch, $n$ must be sufficiently large for ultrasensitivity, $K_d$ must be tuned to place the activation threshold within the relevant physiological range of $[\\text{K}^+]$, and $k_0$ must be large enough to elicit a robust downstream response.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{n}{2}}$$", "id": "2961103"}, {"introduction": "After the inflammasome assembles and activates caspase-1, the final step before pyroptosis and cytokine release is the proteolytic processing of its substrates, such as pro-interleukin-1β (pro-IL-1β).

Integrating this gives:\n$$ [S]_0 - [S](t) + K'_m \\ln\\left(\\frac{[S]_0}{[S](t)}\\right) = V'_{\\max} t $$\nUsing the stoichiometric relation $[P](t) = [S]_0 - [S](t)$, we can write the integrated law in terms of the product concentration $[P](t)$:\n$$ [P](t) + K'_m \\ln\\left(\\frac{[S]_0}{[S]_0 - [P](t)}\\right) = V'_{\\max} t $$\nWe are asked to find $[P]$ at $t = 300$ s with $[S]_0 = 300$ nM, $V'_{\\max} = 1$ nM/s, and $K'_m = 100$ nM.\n$$ [P] + 100 \\ln\\left(\\frac{300}{300 - [P]}\\right) = (1)(300) $$\nThis is a transcendental equation for $[P]$, which must be solved numerically. Let $f([P]) = [P] + 100 \\ln\\left(\\frac{300}{300 - [P]}\\right) - 300$. We search for the root $[P]$ where $f([P]) = 0$.\nBy iterative evaluation:\n- For $[P] = 195$ nM, $f(195) = 195 + 100 \\ln(\\frac{300}{105}) - 300 \\approx 195 + 100(1.0498) - 300 \\approx -0.02$.\nThis value is very close to zero.\n- For $[P] = 195.1$ nM, $f(195.1) = 195.1 + 100 \\ln(\\frac{300}{104.9}) - 300 \\approx 195.1 + 100(1.0508) - 300 \\approx 0.18$.\nThe solution is extremely close to $195.0$ nM. Rounding to three significant figures, the concentration of mature IL-1β is $195$ nM.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{195}$$", "id": "2961131"}]}
