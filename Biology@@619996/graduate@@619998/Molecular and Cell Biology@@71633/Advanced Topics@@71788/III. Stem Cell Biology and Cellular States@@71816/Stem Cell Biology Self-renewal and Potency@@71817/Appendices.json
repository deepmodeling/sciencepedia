The Galton–Watson process is a standard mathematical model for population dynamics, and its application to stem cell proliferation with defined outcomes (symmetric/asymmetric division, differentiation) is a well-established paradigm in theoretical biology. The interpretation of homeostasis as a constant expected population size, which translates to a mean offspring number of one, is a standard and rigorous formalization of the concept. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient constraints to derive a unique relationship between the parameters. The language is objective and precise. The problem is valid.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows. Let $X$ be the random variable representing the number of stem cell daughters produced by a single stem cell in one generation. According to the problem statement, the probability distribution of $X$ is given by:\n$P(X=2) = a$\n$P(X=1) = b$\n$P(X=0) = c$\n\nThe expected value of this random variable, $E[X]$, is defined as the sum of the products of each possible outcome and its probability. The calculation is:\n$$E[X] = \\sum_{i} x_i P(X=x_i) = (2 \\cdot a) + (1 \\cdot b) + (0 \\cdot c)$$\nSimplifying this expression gives:\n$$E[X] = 2a + b$$\n\nThe problem states that the culture is maintained under homeostatic conditions, where the expected population size remains constant across generations. Let $N_k$ be the number of stem cells in generation $k$, for $k \\ge 0$. The condition of homeostasis implies that the expected number of stem cells in generation $k+1$ is equal to the expected number of cells in generation $k$:\n$$E[N_{k+1}] = E[N_k]$$\nfor any generation $k$.\n\nThe number of cells in generation $k+1$, $N_{k+1}$, is the sum of the daughter cells produced by each of the $N_k$ cells present in generation $k$. If we denote the number of daughters from cell $i$ (where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $N_k$) as $X_i$, then:\n$$N_{k+1} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_k} X_i$$\nEach $X_i$ is an independent random variable with the same distribution as $X$. We can find the expectation of $N_{k+1}$ using the law of total expectation (also known as Wald's identity):\n$$E[N_{k+1}] = E[E[N_{k+1} | N_k]]$$\nGiven a fixed number of cells $N_k=n$ in generation $k$, the expected number of cells in the next generation is:\n$$E[N_{k+1} | N_k=n] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[X_i] = n E[X]$$\nSubstituting this back into the law of total expectation:\n$$E[N_{k+1}] = E[N_k \\cdot E[X]]$$\nSince $E[X]$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the expectation:\n$$E[N_{k+1}] = E[X] \\cdot E[N_k]$$\n\nNow, we apply the homeostasis condition $E[N_{k+1}] = E[N_k]$:\n$$E[X] \\cdot E[N_k] = E[N_k]$$\nAssuming the population is not extinct (i.e., $E[N_k] > 0$), we can divide both sides by $E[N_k]$:\n$$E[X] = 1$$\nThis is the mathematical representation of homeostasis in a branching process model: the average number of offspring per individual must be exactly $1$.\n\nWe have already derived the expression for $E[X]$ in terms of the probabilities $a$ and $b$:\n$$E[X] = 2a + b$$\nEquating this with the value required for homeostasis:\n$$2a + b = 1$$\nThe problem asks for an explicit expression for $b$ in terms of $a$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $b$:\n$$b = 1 - 2a$$\nThis is the final derived relationship. It is worth noting that combining this result with the constraint $a+b+c=1$ yields $a + (1-2a) + c = 1$, which simplifies to $-a+c=0$, or $c=a$. This means that for a stem cell population to be in homeostasis under this model, the probability of symmetric self-renewal must be equal to the probability of symmetric differentiation. The derivation of $b$ as a function of $a$ is, however, independent of the variable $c$ and is complete.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1 - 2a}$$", "id": "2965059"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the population to the single-cell level, the decision to exit the self-renewing state and commit to differentiation is not instantaneous but occurs within a specific temporal window, often the $G_1$ phase of the cell cycle.

It describes a classic problem in quantitative cell biology, modeling a stochastic cell fate decision as a first-passage-time process governed by a constant hazard rate. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the statement that the initiation of differentiation is a rare transcriptional event occurring randomly with a constant hazard, or rate, denoted by $r$. This describes a memoryless process, where the probability of the event occurring in any small time interval is independent of the history. The time until the first such event follows an exponential distribution.\n\nLet $S(t)$ be the survival function, which represents the probability that the triggering event has *not* occurred by time $t$. For a process with a constant hazard rate $r$, the survival function is given by the differential equation $\\frac{dS}{dt} = -rS(t)$, with the initial condition $S(0) = 1$. The solution is:\n$$ S(t) = \\exp(-rt) $$\nThe per-cycle probability of differentiation, $p(T)$, is defined as the probability that at least one triggering event occurs during a $G_{1}$ interval of duration $T$.

Applying our derived relationship:\n$$ p_{0} = 1 - \\exp(-rT_{0}) $$\nThe objective is to find the new differentiation probability, $p_{\\mathrm{new}}$, when the $G_{1}$ duration is lengthened to $T_{\\mathrm{new}} = T_{0} + \\Delta T$. The hazard rate $r$ is stated to be unaffected by the treatment. Therefore, the new probability is:\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{new}} = 1 - \\exp(-r(T_{0} + \\Delta T)) $$\nTo express $p_{\\mathrm{new}}$ in terms of the given parameters ($p_{0}$, $T_{0}$, $\\Delta T$), we must first eliminate the unknown hazard rate $r$.

Consider a single glucose molecule processed under two regimes: (i) glycolysis followed by lactate fermentation under oxygenated conditions, which reoxidizes cytosolic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) without engaging the electron transport chain (ETC), and (ii) complete oxidation by mitochondrial respiration, in which pyruvate is converted to acetyl-coenzyme A and fully oxidized in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) formed primarily by oxidative phosphorylation. Use the following well-tested facts as the starting point for your derivations: glycolysis nets $2$ ATP and $2$ NADH per glucose; lactate dehydrogenase reduces pyruvate to lactate and reoxidizes the $2$ cytosolic NADH to NAD$^{+}$ without producing additional ATP; the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex generates $1$ NADH per pyruvate converted to acetyl-coenzyme A; each turn of the TCA cycle (per acetyl-coenzyme A) yields $3$ NADH, $1$ flavin adenine dinucleotide in the reduced form (FADH$_2$), and $1$ guanosine triphosphate (GTP) that is rapidly equilibrated with ATP; under the malate–aspartate shuttle, each cytosolic NADH from glycolysis is transferred as mitochondrial NADH; the phosphate/oxygen (P/O) ratios are $2.5$ ATP per NADH oxidized by the ETC and $1.5$ ATP per FADH$_2$ oxidized by the ETC.
