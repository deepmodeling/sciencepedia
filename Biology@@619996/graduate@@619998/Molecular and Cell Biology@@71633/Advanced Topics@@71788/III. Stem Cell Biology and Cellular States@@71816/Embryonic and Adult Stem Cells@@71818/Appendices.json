The state $k=0$ is an absorbing state, representing extinction.\n\nThe key property of a linear birth-death process is that each individual in the population behaves independently of the others. Consequently, the probability of extinction starting with $k$ individuals is the product of the individual extinction probabilities for each of the $k$ lineages. Thus, we have the relation $\\pi_k = (\\pi_1)^k$ for any integer $k \\ge 1$.\n\nThe problem states that we must derive the solution by conditioning on the first event in the process.

Extinction is immediate and certain. Therefore, $\\mathbb{P}(\\text{extinction} | \\text{1st event is death}) = 1$. The probability of this path is $(1)(1-p)$.\n-   If the first event is a birth, the population becomes $2$. The process then continues from this new state.

For $p  \\frac{1}{2}$, this root is not physically possible.\nThe second root is $\\frac{1 - (1-2p)}{2p} = \\frac{2p}{2p} = 1$. This root is valid for all $p$ in this range.\nTherefore, for $p \\le \\frac{1}{2}$, the correct extinction probability is $\\pi_1 = 1$.\n\nCase 2: Supercritical regime ($\\lambda > \\mu$).\nThis condition translates to $rp > r(1-p)$, or $p > \\frac{1}{2}$.\nIn this regime, the birth rate exceeds the death rate, and there is a non-zero probability that the population will grow indefinitely. Thus, the extinction probability must be strictly less than $1$, i.e., $\\pi_1  1$.\nFor $p > \\frac{1}{2}$, we have $1-2p  0$, so $|1-2p|=-(1-2p)=2p-1$.\nThe roots become:\n$$ \\pi_1 = \\frac{1 \\pm (2p-1)}{2p} $$\nThe first root is $\\frac{1 + (2p-1)}{2p} = \\frac{2p}{2p} = 1$. This root is invalid because we require $\\pi_1  1$.\nThe second root is $\\frac{1 - (2p-1)}{2p} = \\frac{2-2p}{2p} = \\frac{1-p}{p}$. Since $p > \\frac{1}{2}$, it follows that $1-p  p$, and thus $\\frac{1-p}{p}  1$.

The second condition defines an interval $(-\\infty, x_B]$, which within our domain is $[0, x_B]$.\n\nThe stemness zone is the intersection of these two intervals, which is $[0, \\min(x_W, x_B)]$. The problem asks for the length of the maximal contiguous interval starting from $x=0$, which is $x_{\\ast} = \\min(x_W, x_B)$. This assumes that $x=0$ is part of the stemness zone, which it is, since $W(0) = W_{0} = 150 > W_{\\mathrm{thr}} = 50$, and $B(0) = B_{L} \\exp(-L/\\lambda_B)$ is very small, demonstrably less than $B_{\\mathrm{thr}}$.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values.\nThe Wnt decay length is:\n$$\\lambda_{W} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D_{W}}{k_{W}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2.0 \\times 10^0}{2.0 \\times 10^{-4}}} = \\sqrt{10^{4}} = 100 \\text{ micrometers}$$\nThe BMP decay length is:\n$$\\lambda_{B} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D_{B}}{k_{B}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.5 \\times 10^0}{6.7 \\times 10^{-5}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{5}}{6.7}} \\approx 149.6264 \\text{ micrometers}$$\nThe upper bound from the Wnt condition is:\n$$x_W = \\lambda_{W} \\ln\\left(\\frac{W_{0}}{W_{\\mathrm{thr}}}\\right) = 100 \\ln\\left(\\frac{150}{50}\\right) = 100 \\ln(3) \\approx 100 \\times 1.098612 = 109.8612 \\text{ micrometers}$$\nThe upper bound from the BMP condition is:\n$$x_B = L - \\lambda_{B} \\ln\\left(\\frac{B_{L}}{B_{\\mathrm{thr}}}\\right) = 500 - \\lambda_{B} \\ln\\left(\\frac{100}{40}\\right) = 500 - \\lambda_{B} \\ln(2.5)$$\n$$x_B \\approx 500 - 149.6264 \\times \\ln(2.5) \\approx 500 - 149.6264 \\times 0.916291 \\approx 500 - 137.1082 = 362.8918 \\text{ micrometers}$$\nThe upper boundary of the stemness zone is the minimum of these two values:\n$$x_{\\ast} = \\min(x_W, x_B) = \\min(109.8612, 362.8918) = 109.8612 \\text{ micrometers}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$x_{\\ast} \\approx 109.9 \\text{ micrometers}$$\nThis value represents the length of the interval $[0, x_{\\ast}]$ where stem cell identity is maintained.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{109.9}\n$$", "id": "2942398"}]}
