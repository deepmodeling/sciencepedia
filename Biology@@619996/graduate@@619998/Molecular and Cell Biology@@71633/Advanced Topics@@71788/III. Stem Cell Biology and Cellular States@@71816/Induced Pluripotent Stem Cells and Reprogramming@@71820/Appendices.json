Infections are performed at low to moderate viral load such that the number of successful entry events per vector per cell is well modeled by a Poisson distribution and entry events from different vectors are independent of each other. Assume each of the four vectors is applied at the same multiplicity of infection (MOI), denoted by $m$, defined as the mean number of successful entry events per cell for that vector. A cell is considered competent for reprogramming if and only if it receives at least one successful entry event from each of the four vectors; receiving multiple copies from any single vector provides no additional benefit.\n\nUsing only the definition of the Poisson distribution and independence of events across the four vectors, determine the total multiplicity of infection across all four vectors, denoted $M_{\\text{total}}$, required so that a randomly chosen cell has probability $0.95$ of receiving at least one successful entry event from each of the four vectors.

First, we must derive the mathematical model for the demethylation process. Second, we must use provided data to estimate a parameter of this model.\n\nPart 1: Derivation and solution of the governing differential equation.\n\nThe problem states that the conversion of a methylated allele to an unmethylated state is a memoryless, first-order process. This implies that the rate of conversion is directly proportional to the number of methylated alleles remaining. Let $p(t)$ be the probability that a randomly chosen allele is methylated at time $t$. In a large population, $p(t)$ is equivalent to the fraction of methylated alleles. The rate of change of this fraction, $\\frac{dp(t)}{dt}$, is proportional to the fraction itself, $p(t)$. The constant of proportionality is the negative of the per-allele hazard rate, $\\lambda$, because the fraction of methylated alleles decreases over time.\n\nThus, the governing ordinary differential equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dp(t)}{dt} = -\\lambda p(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. It is separable. We can rearrange the equation as:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{p(t)} dp(t) = -\\lambda dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides of the equation. The left side is integrated from the initial probability $p(0)$ to $p(t)$, and the right side is integrated from time $0$ to $t$.\n$$\n\\int_{p(0)}^{p(t)} \\frac{1}{p'} dp' = \\int_{0}^{t} (-\\lambda) dt'\n$$\nExecuting the integration gives:\n$$\n[\\ln(p')]_{p(0)}^{p(t)} = [-\\lambda t']_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(p(t)) - \\ln(p(0)) = -\\lambda t - 0\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{p(t)}{p(0)}\\right) = -\\lambda t\n$$\nThe problem specifies the initial condition $p(0) = 1$, which means all alleles are methylated at $t=0$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{p(t)}{1}\\right) = \\ln(p(t)) = -\\lambda t\n$$\nTo obtain a closed-form expression for $p(t)$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\np(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n$$\nThis is the solution to the differential equation and the functional form for the probability of an allele remaining methylated at time $t$.\n\nPart 2: Estimation of the rate constant $\\lambda$.\n\nWe are given a set of measurements of the methylated fraction, $\\hat{p}(t_i)$, at four time points, $t_i$. We are to estimate $\\lambda$ using ordinary least squares (OLS) on a linearized model. The model derived in Part 1 is $p(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$. Applying the natural logarithm linearizes this relationship:\n$$\n\\ln(p(t)) = -\\lambda t\n$$\nThis equation is in the form of a line, $y=mx$, where $y = \\ln(p(t))$, $x = t$, and the slope is $m = -\\lambda$.

Since the cells are assumed to be independent, the probability that all $T$ cells are *not* undifferentiated is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(\\text{zero undifferentiated cells in } T) = (1-p) \\times (1-p) \\times \\dots \\times (1-p) \\text{ (} T \\text{ times)} = (1-p)^T$$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the risk gives the desired formula:\n$$r(p, T) = 1 - (1-p)^T$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Upper Confidence Bound, $p_{\\max}(n, \\eta, \\alpha)$**\n\nWe are tasked with deriving an exact one-sided upper confidence bound $p_{\\max}$ for the unknown parameter $p$. This bound is based on the observation that zero positive results were found in a sample of $n$ cells, assayed with a test of sensitivity $\\eta$ and perfect specificity. The confidence level is $1-\\alpha$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the probability of a single cell testing negative as a function of $p$. Let $U$ be the event that a cell is an undifferentiated iPSC ($P(U) = p$), and $D$ be the event that it is a differentiated cell ($P(D) = 1-p$). The test characteristics are:\n- Sensitivity: $P(\\text{Test Positive} | U) = \\eta$. Thus, the probability of a false negative for an undifferentiated cell is $P(\\text{Test Negative} | U) = 1 - \\eta$.\n- Perfect Specificity: $P(\\text{Test Negative} | D) = 1$.\n\nUsing the law of total probability, the overall probability of a single cell testing negative is:\n$$P(\\text{Test Negative}) = P(\\text{Test Negative} | U) P(U) + P(\\text{Test Negative} | D) P(D)$$\n$$P(\\text{Test Negative}) = (1-\\eta)p + (1)(1-p) = 1 - \\eta p$$\n\nLet $E$ be the event that all $n$ independent assays return a negative result.

The upper bound $p_{\\max}$ is the value of $p$ for which the probability of observing our result (zero positives), or a result even more extreme, is equal to the significance level $\\alpha$. Let $X$ be the random variable for the number of positive cells observed. We observed $X=0$. In testing for an upper bound, outcomes with fewer positives (like $X=0$) are considered more extreme in favor of smaller values of $p$. The p-value for our observation is $P(X \\le 0|p) = P(X=0|p)$. The upper bound $p_{\\max}$ is the value of $p$ that makes this p-value equal to $\\alpha$.\n\nThus, we set the probability of our observed event equal to $\\alpha$:\n$$P(E | p_{\\max}) = \\alpha$$\n$$(1 - \\eta p_{\\max})^n = \\alpha$$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $p_{\\max}$:\n$$1 - \\eta p_{\\max} = \\alpha^{1/n}$$\n$$\\eta p_{\\max} = 1 - \\alpha^{1/n}$$\n$$p_{\\max}(n, \\eta, \\alpha) = \\frac{1 - \\alpha^{1/n}}{\\eta}$$\nThis is the exact one-sided upper confidence bound derived from first principles.\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Computation of $p_{\\max}$**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Number of assayed cells, $n = 3.0 \\times 10^6$\n- Assay sensitivity, $\\eta = 0.95$\n- Significance level, $\\alpha = 0.05$\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived formula for $p_{\\max}$:\n$$p_{\\max} = \\frac{1 - (0.05)^{1/(3.0 \\times 10^6)}}{0.95}$$\n\nTo evaluate this expression, we first compute the term $(0.05)^{1/(3.0 \\times 10^6)}$.
