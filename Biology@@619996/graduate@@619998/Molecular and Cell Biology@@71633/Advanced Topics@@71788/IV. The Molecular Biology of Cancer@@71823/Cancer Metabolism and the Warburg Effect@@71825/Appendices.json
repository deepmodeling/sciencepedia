Consider cytosolic palmitate synthesis by fatty acid synthase from acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), where malonyl-CoA is produced from acetyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase, consuming adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and chain elongation reduction steps consume nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). Use the following well-tested biochemical facts as your starting point: (i) palmitate is assembled from an acetyl-CoA primer and successive additions of two-carbon units supplied by malonyl-CoA; (ii) each malonyl-CoA is generated from one acetyl-CoA and one bicarbonate with the hydrolysis of one ATP; (iii) each two-carbon elongation cycle on fatty acid synthase requires two NADPH for the reductive steps.\n\nFrom these bases, derive the stoichiometric requirements (molecules consumed per palmitate produced) of acetyl-CoA, ATP, and NADPH to synthesize $1$ pmol of palmitate.

The solution is derived from fundamental biochemical stoichiometry.\n\nFirst, we must establish the precise stoichiometry for the synthesis of one molecule of palmitate from its precursors, based on the provided facts. Palmitate is a saturated fatty acid with a $16$-carbon backbone, denoted as $C_{16:0}$.\n\nThe synthesis pathway proceeds as follows:\n$1$. The carbon backbone is constructed from $2$-carbon units derived from acetyl coenzyme A ($\\text{acetyl-CoA}$). A $16$-carbon chain therefore requires a total of $16 / 2 = 8$ molecules of $\\text{acetyl-CoA}$.\n\n$2$. According to fact (i), synthesis is initiated by a single $\\text{acetyl-CoA}$ molecule which serves as a primer. The remaining $16 - 2 = 14$ carbons are added sequentially in the form of $2$-carbon units. This requires $14 / 2 = 7$ cycles of chain elongation.\n\n$3$. The $2$-carbon units for elongation are supplied by malonyl-CoA. Therefore, $7$ molecules of malonyl-CoA are needed.\n\n$4$. Fact (ii) states that each molecule of malonyl-CoA is synthesized from one molecule of $\\text{acetyl-CoA}$ and one molecule of bicarbonate ($\\text{HCO}_3^-$), a reaction catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase that consumes one molecule of adenosine triphosphate ($\\text{ATP}$). The synthesis of $7$ molecules of malonyl-CoA thus consumes $7$ molecules of $\\text{acetyl-CoA}$ and $7$ molecules of $\\text{ATP}$.\n\n$5$. The total stoichiometric requirement of $\\text{acetyl-CoA}$ is the sum of the primer and the $\\text{acetyl-CoA}$ used for malonyl-CoA synthesis: $1$ (primer) $+ 7$ (for malonyl-CoA) $= 8$ molecules of $\\text{acetyl-CoA}$. This is consistent with our initial calculation in step $1$.\n\n$6$. The total $\\text{ATP}$ requirement is solely for the synthesis of malonyl-CoA, as per the problem's constraints. Thus, $7$ molecules of $\\text{ATP}$ are consumed.\n\n$7$. Fact (iii) states that each $2$-carbon elongation cycle requires two molecules of $\\text{NADPH}$ for the reduction steps.
