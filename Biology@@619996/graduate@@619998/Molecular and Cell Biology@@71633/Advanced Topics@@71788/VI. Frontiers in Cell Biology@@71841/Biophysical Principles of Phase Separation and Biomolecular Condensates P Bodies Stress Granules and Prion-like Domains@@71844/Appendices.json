This is a fundamental concept in physical chemistry and biophysics, correctly applied to biomolecular condensates. The problem is well-posed; it provides all necessary constants and simplifying assumptions required to derive a unique solution. The given concentrations ($c_{\\text{sat}}$, $c_{\\text{den}}$, $c_{\\text{tot}}$) are physically realistic for protein phase separation. The condition for phase separation, $c_{\\text{tot}} > c_{\\text{sat}}$ (since $6.0 > 2.8$), is satisfied, ensuring the problem setup is consistent. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds by applying the principle of conservation of mass. Let $V$ be the total volume of the system. This volume is partitioned into the volume of the dilute phase, $V_{\\text{dil}}$, and the volume of the dense phase, $V_{\\text{den}}$. Since volume change upon mixing is neglected, we have:\n$$V = V_{\\text{dil}} + V_{\\text{den}}$$\nThe volume fractions of the dilute and dense phases, $\\phi_{\\text{dil}}$ and $\\phi_{\\text{den}}$ respectively, are defined as:\n$$\\phi_{\\text{dil}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{dil}}}{V} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\phi_{\\text{den}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{den}}}{V}$$\nFrom these definitions, it follows that the sum of the volume fractions is unity:\n$$\\phi_{\\text{dil}} + \\phi_{\\text{den}} = 1$$\nThe total number of moles of the protein, $n_{\\text{tot}}$, is given by the total concentration $c_{\\text{tot}}$ multiplied by the total volume $V$. This total amount must be equal to the sum of the protein amounts in the dilute and dense phases:\n$$n_{\\text{tot}} = n_{\\text{dil}} + n_{\\text{den}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the number of moles in each phase ($n = c \\times V$):\n$$c_{\\text{tot}} V = c_{\\text{dil}} V_{\\text{dil}} + c_{\\text{den}} V_{\\text{den}}$$\nAccording to the problem statement, because the total concentration $c_{\\text{tot}}$ ($6.0\\,\\mu\\text{M}$) exceeds the saturation concentration $c_{\\text{sat}}$ ($2.8\\,\\mu\\text{M}$), the system phase separates. In this two-phase coexistence regime, the concentration in the dilute phase is fixed at the saturation value, so $c_{\\text{dil}} = c_{\\text{sat}}$. Thus, the mass balance equation becomes:\n$$c_{\\text{tot}} V = c_{\\text{sat}} V_{\\text{dil}} + c_{\\text{den}} V_{\\text{den}}$$\nTo obtain an expression in terms of volume fractions, we divide the entire equation by the total volume $V$:\n$$c_{\\text{tot}} = c_{\\text{sat}} \\left(\\frac{V_{\\text{dil}}}{V}\\right) + c_{\\text{den}} \\left(\\frac{V_{\\text{den}}}{V}\\right)$$\n$$c_{\\text{tot}} = c_{\\text{sat}} \\phi_{\\text{dil}} + c_{\\text{den}} \\phi_{\\text{den}}$$\nWe seek to find $\\phi_{\\text{den}}$. We can eliminate $\\phi_{\\text{dil}}$ by using the relation $\\phi_{\\text{dil}} = 1 - \\phi_{\\text{den}}$:\n$$c_{\\text{tot}} = c_{\\text{sat}} (1 - \\phi_{\\text{den}}) + c_{\\text{den}} \\phi_{\\text{den}}$$\nNow, we rearrange the equation to solve for $\\phi_{\\text{den}}$:\n$$c_{\\text{tot}} = c_{\\text{sat}} - c_{\\text{sat}} \\phi_{\\text{den}} + c_{\\text{den}} \\phi_{\\text{den}}$$\n$$c_{\\text{tot}} - c_{\\text{sat}} = (c_{\\text{den}} - c_{\\text{sat}}) \\phi_{\\text{den}}$$\nIsolating $\\phi_{\\text{den}}$ yields the desired general expression:\n$$\\phi_{\\text{den}} = \\frac{c_{\\text{tot}} - c_{\\text{sat}}}{c_{\\text{den}} - c_{\\text{sat}}}$$\nThis is the expression for the volume fraction of the dense phase, which is a form of the lever rule.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided data: $c_{\\text{tot}} = 6.0\\,\\mu\\text{M}$, $c_{\\text{sat}} = 2.8\\,\\mu\\text{M}$, and $c_{\\text{den}} = 1000\\,\\mu\\text{M}$.\n$$\\phi_{\\text{den}} = \\frac{6.0 - 2.8}{1000 - 2.8} = \\frac{3.2}{997.2}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\\phi_{\\text{den}} \\approx 0.003208985...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
