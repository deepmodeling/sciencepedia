We proceed.\n\nThe first task is to compute the Generalized Polarization ($GP$) for the pure liquid-disordered (Ld) and liquid-ordered (Lo) phases, and the change $\\Delta GP$ between them. The definition of $GP$ is provided as:\n$$GP = \\dfrac{I_{440} - I_{490}}{I_{440} + I_{490}}$$\nwhere $I_{440}$ and $I_{490}$ are the fluorescence emission intensities at the wavelengths $440\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and $490\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, respectively.\n\nFor the pure liquid-disordered (Ld) phase, the given intensities are $I_{440}^{\\mathrm{Ld}} = 4.50 \\times 10^{5}$ counts and $I_{490}^{\\mathrm{Ld}} = 5.50 \\times 10^{5}$ counts.

This derivation is based on the provided principle of additivity of emission contributions.\n\nFor a mixed-phase system, the total intensities at each wavelength are the sum of contributions from each phase, weighted by their area fractions $f_{\\mathrm{Ld}}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{Lo}}$:\n$$I_{440} = f_{\\mathrm{Ld}} I_{440}^{\\mathrm{Ld}} + f_{\\mathrm{Lo}} I_{440}^{\\mathrm{Lo}}$$\n$$I_{490} = f_{\\mathrm{Ld}} I_{490}^{\\mathrm{Ld}} + f_{\\mathrm{Lo}} I_{490}^{\\mathrm{Lo}}$$\nThe area fractions must sum to unity: $f_{\\mathrm{Ld}} + f_{\\mathrm{Lo}} = 1$. The $GP$ of the mixture is therefore:\n$$GP = \\dfrac{(f_{\\mathrm{Ld}} I_{440}^{\\mathrm{Ld}} + f_{\\mathrm{Lo}} I_{440}^{\\mathrm{Lo}}) - (f_{\\mathrm{Ld}} I_{490}^{\\mathrm{Ld}} + f_{\\mathrm{Lo}} I_{490}^{\\mathrm{Lo}})}{(f_{\\mathrm{Ld}} I_{440}^{\\mathrm{Ld}} + f_{\\mathrm{Lo}} I_{440}^{\\mathrm{Lo}}) + (f_{\\mathrm{Ld}} I_{490}^{\\mathrm{Ld}} + f_{\\mathrm{Lo}} I_{490}^{\\mathrm{Lo}})}$$\nThis expression can be simplified by examining the total intensity, $S = I_{440} + I_{490}$. For the pure phases, we find:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{Ld}} = I_{440}^{\\mathrm{Ld}} + I_{490}^{\\mathrm{Ld}} = (4.50 + 5.50) \\times 10^{5} = 10.00 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\text{counts}$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{Lo}} = I_{440}^{\\mathrm{Lo}} + I_{490}^{\\mathrm{Lo}} = (6.75 + 3.25) \\times 10^{5} = 10.00 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\text{counts}$$\nThe total intensity, $S_0 = S_{\\mathrm{Ld}} = S_{\\mathrm{Lo}}$, is constant for the two pure phases. This is a critical simplification. For a mixture, the total intensity is also $S_0$: $D = f_{\\mathrm{Ld}} S_{\\mathrm{Ld}} + f_{\\mathrm{Lo}} S_{\\mathrm{Lo}} = (f_{\\mathrm{Ld}} + f_{\\mathrm{Lo}})S_0 = S_0$.\nThe numerator $N$ can be expressed in terms of the pure phase $GP$ values: $N = f_{\\mathrm{Ld}}(I_{440}^{\\mathrm{Ld}} - I_{490}^{\\mathrm{Ld}}) + f_{\\mathrm{Lo}}(I_{440}^{\\mathrm{Lo}} - I_{490}^{\\mathrm{Lo}}) = f_{\\mathrm{Ld}} (GP_{\\mathrm{Ld}} S_{\\mathrm{Ld}}) + f_{\\mathrm{Lo}} (GP_{\\mathrm{Lo}} S_{\\mathrm{Lo}})$.\nUnder the condition $S_{\\mathrm{Ld}} = S_{\\mathrm{Lo}} = S_0$, the expression for the mixture's $GP$ becomes a simple linear interpolation:\n$$GP = \\dfrac{f_{\\mathrm{Ld}} (GP_{\\mathrm{Ld}} S_0) + f_{\\mathrm{Lo}} (GP_{\\mathrm{Lo}} S_0)}{S_0} = f_{\\mathrm{Ld}} GP_{\\mathrm{Ld}} + f_{\\mathrm{Lo}} GP_{\\mathrm{Lo}}$$\nTo solve for $f_{\\mathrm{Lo}}$, we substitute $f_{\\mathrm{Ld}} = 1 - f_{\\mathrm{Lo}}$:\n$$GP = (1 - f_{\\mathrm{Lo}}) GP_{\\mathrm{Ld}} + f_{\\mathrm{Lo}} GP_{\\mathrm{Lo}}$$\n$$GP = GP_{\\mathrm{Ld}} - f_{\\mathrm{Lo}} GP_{\\mathrm{Ld}} + f_{\\mathrm{Lo}} GP_{\\mathrm{Lo}}$$\n$$GP - GP_{\\mathrm{Ld}} = f_{\\mathrm{Lo}} (GP_{\\mathrm{Lo}} - GP_{\\mathrm{Ld}})$$\nThis gives the explicit relation for $f_{\\mathrm{Lo}}$ as a function of $GP$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{Lo}}(GP) = \\dfrac{GP - GP_{\\mathrm{Ld}}}{GP_{\\mathrm{Lo}} - GP_{\\mathrm{Ld}}}$$\nTo match the required form $f_{\\mathrm{Lo}}(GP) = \\alpha\\, GP + \\beta$, we arrange the terms:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{Lo}}(GP) = \\left( \\dfrac{1}{GP_{\\mathrm{Lo}} - GP_{\\mathrm{Ld}}} \\right) GP - \\dfrac{GP_{\\mathrm{Ld}}}{GP_{\\mathrm{Lo}} - GP_{\\mathrm{Ld}}}$$\nBy comparison, we identify the coefficients $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$:\n$$\\alpha = \\dfrac{1}{GP_{\\mathrm{Lo}} - GP_{\\mathrm{Ld}}} = \\dfrac{1}{\\Delta GP}$$\n$$\\beta = -\\dfrac{GP_{\\mathrm{Ld}}}{GP_{\\mathrm{Lo}} - GP_{\\mathrm{Ld}}} = -\\dfrac{GP_{\\mathrm{Ld}}}{\\Delta GP}$$\nWe now substitute the numerical values $GP_{\\mathrm{Ld}} = -0.100$ and $\\Delta GP = 0.450$:\n$$\\alpha = \\dfrac{1}{0.450} = 2.222\\overline{2}$$\n$$\\beta = -\\dfrac{-0.100}{0.450} = \\dfrac{0.100}{0.450} = 0.222\\overline{2}$$\nRounding these coefficients to four significant figures as required gives:\n$$\\alpha = 2.222$$\n$$\\beta = 0.2222$$\nThe three quantities to be reported are $\\Delta GP$, $\\alpha$, and $\\beta$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.4500  2.222  0.2222\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2723821"}, {"introduction": "While biophysical methods offer precision in model systems, cell biologists often rely on biochemical fractionation to probe protein localization.

It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of membrane phase separation and the experimental technique of detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) isolation. All provided parameters are physically plausible and mathematically consistent. The task is to evaluate a claim and identify the most rigorous experimental design for calibrating the DRM assay against a direct measurement of phase partitioning, and to verify a quantitative prediction. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities. I will proceed with the derivation and evaluation.\n\nThe core of the problem is to relate the equilibrium partitioning of a protein $P$ between liquid-ordered (Lo) and liquid-disordered (Ld) phases with the fraction of that protein recovered in a DRM preparation.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the true fraction of protein $P$ that resides in the Lo phase at thermodynamic equilibrium. This fraction, which we denote as $f_{P, \\text{Lo}}$, depends on the protein's partition coefficient, $K_{\\mathrm{Lo}}$, and the area fraction of the Lo phase, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{Lo}}$.\nThe partition coefficient is defined as the ratio of area-normalized concentrations:\n$$K_{\\mathrm{Lo}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{Lo}}}{C_{\\mathrm{Ld}}}$$\nwhere $C_{\\mathrm{Lo}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{Ld}}$ are the concentrations of $P$ in the Lo and Ld phases, respectively. Let $N_{P, \\text{Lo}}$ and $N_{P, \\text{Ld}}$ be the total number of protein molecules in the Lo and Ld phases, and let $A_{\\mathrm{Lo}}$ and $A_{\\mathrm{Ld}}$ be the areas of these phases.\nThen $C_{\\mathrm{Lo}} = N_{P, \\text{Lo}}/A_{\\mathrm{Lo}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{Ld}} = N_{P, \\text{Ld}}/A_{\\mathrm{Ld}}$.\nGiven a total membrane area $A_T$, we have $A_{\\mathrm{Lo}} = \\phi_{\\mathrm{Lo}} A_T$ and $A_{\\mathrm{Ld}} = (1-\\phi_{\\mathrm{Lo}})A_T$.\nThe total number of molecules of protein $P$ is $N_P = N_{P, \\text{Lo}} + N_{P, \\text{Ld}}$.\nThe fraction of $P$ in the Lo phase is $f_{P, \\text{Lo}} = N_{P, \\text{Lo}} / N_P$.\n\nFrom the definitions, we can write:\n$$N_{P, \\text{Lo}} = C_{\\mathrm{Lo}} A_{\\mathrm{Lo}} = (K_{\\mathrm{Lo}} C_{\\mathrm{Ld}}) (\\phi_{\\mathrm{Lo}} A_T)$$\n$$N_{P, \\text{Ld}} = C_{\\mathrm{Ld}} A_{\\mathrm{Ld}} = C_{\\mathrm{Ld}} ((1-\\phi_{\\mathrm{Lo}}) A_T)$$\nThe fraction $f_{P, \\text{Lo}}$ is then:\n$$f_{P, \\text{Lo}} = \\frac{N_{P, \\text{Lo}}}{N_{P, \\text{Lo}} + N_{P, \\text{Ld}}} = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{Lo}} C_{\\mathrm{Ld}} \\phi_{\\mathrm{Lo}} A_T}{K_{\\mathrm{Lo}} C_{\\mathrm{Ld}} \\phi_{\\mathrm{Lo}} A_T + C_{\\mathrm{Ld}} (1-\\phi_{\\mathrm{Lo}}) A_T}$$\nBy simplifying, we arrive at the mass balance equation:\n$$f_{P, \\text{Lo}} = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{Lo}} \\phi_{\\mathrm{Lo}}}{K_{\\mathrm{Lo}} \\phi_{\\mathrm{Lo}} + (1-\\phi_{\\mathrm{Lo}})}$$\nUsing the provided data, $K_{\\mathrm{Lo}} = 5.0$ and $\\phi_{\\mathrm{Lo}} = 0.30$:\n$$f_{P, \\text{Lo}} = \\frac{(5.0)(0.30)}{(5.0)(0.30) + (1-0.30)} = \\frac{1.5}{1.5 + 0.7} = \\frac{1.5}{2.2} \\approx 0.6818$$\nThus, at equilibrium, approximately $68\\%$ of protein $P$ is in the Lo phase. This is the \"ground truth\" for Lo association.\n\nNext, we calculate the expected fraction of protein $P$ recovered in the DRM fraction, which we denote $f_{P, \\text{DRM}}$. The DRM fraction consists of the insoluble parts of both the Lo and Ld phases. The problem states that the fraction of Ld material solubilized is $s_{\\mathrm{Ld}} = 0.90$ and the fraction of Lo material solubilized is $s_{\\mathrm{Lo}} = 0.20$. Therefore, the resistant (insoluble) fractions are:\n$$r_{\\mathrm{Ld}} = 1 - s_{\\mathrm{Ld}} = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$$\n$$r_{\\mathrm{Lo}} = 1 - s_{\\mathrm{Lo}} = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$$\nThe total amount of protein $P$ in the DRM fraction is the sum of the resistant protein from the Lo phase and the resistant protein from the Ld phase. The amount of protein P starting in the Lo phase is $f_{P, \\text{Lo}} N_P$, and the amount starting in the Ld phase is $(1-f_{P, \\text{Lo}})N_P$.\nThe fraction of total protein recovered in the DRM pellet is:\n$$f_{P, \\text{DRM}} = f_{P, \\text{Lo}} \\cdot r_{\\mathrm{Lo}} + (1-f_{P, \\text{Lo}}) \\cdot r_{\\mathrm{Ld}}$$\nSubstituting the values we have calculated:\n$$f_{P, \\text{DRM}} = \\left(\\frac{1.5}{2.2}\\right) (0.80) + \\left(1-\\frac{1.5}{2.2}\\right) (0.10)$$\n$$f_{P, \\text{DRM}} = \\left(\\frac{1.5}{2.2}\\right) (0.80) + \\left(\\frac{0.7}{2.2}\\right) (0.10)$$\n$$f_{P, \\text{DRM}} = \\frac{1.2}{2.2} + \\frac{0.07}{2.2} = \\frac{1.27}{2.2} \\approx 0.57727$$\nThis value, rounded to two decimal places, is $0.58$. The calculation shows that for this protein, the measured DRM fraction ($58\\%$) is a significant underestimate of the true Lo fraction ($68\\%$). This discrepancy highlights the necessity of calibrating the DRM assay.\n\nNow, I will evaluate each option.\n\n- **A.** This option proposes a direct calibration experiment. It correctly identifies the need to measure the ground truth ($K_{\\mathrm{Lo}}$ and $\\phi_{\\mathrm{Lo}}$ in GPMVs) and compare it against the biochemical measurement (DRM recovery). This is the definition of calibration. The suggestion to repeat this across a range of proteins and conditions to generate a calibration curve is excellent scientific practice. The quantitative part states that the expected DRM fraction is approximately $0.58$. My derivation confirms this value: $f_{P, \\text{DRM}} \\approx 0.58$. The experimental design is rigorous, and the calculation is correct. **Correct**.\n\n- **B.** This option proposes correlating Laurdan GP in intact cells with DRM recovery. This is not a calibration against a ground truth of partitioning, but a correlation between two indirect and complex measurements performed in a living cell, an environment far more complicated than the GPMV model system. The quantitative claim that the DRM fraction should be $K_{\\mathrm{Lo}}/(1+K_{\\mathrm{Lo}}) \\approx 0.83$ is fundamentally incorrect. This formula does not properly account for mass balance (it ignores $\\phi_{\\mathrm{Lo}}$) and completely disregards the non-ideal nature of detergent extraction ($s_{\\mathrm{Lo}}$ and $s_{\\mathrm{Ld}}$), which are explicitly given in the problem. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **C.** This option proposes using CTB cross-linking to induce domains. This is an active perturbation, not a measurement of equilibrium partitioning. It changes the system it intends to measure. Co-floatation is merely a variation on DRM isolation. The quantitative claim that the DRM fraction equals the Lo area fraction ($\\phi_{\\mathrm{Lo}} = 0.30$) is baseless. The fraction of a partitioning protein in a phase is not equal to the area fraction of that phase, unless $K_{\\mathrm{Lo}}$ is very large and extraction is perfect, neither of which is true here. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D.** This option suggests a \"consensus DRM\" approach using two detergents in intact cells. While this may be a strategy to refine the DRM protocol, it remains a purely biochemical assay and does not perform the requested calibration against a physical standard (equilibrium partitioning in GPMVs). The quantitative claim that the DRM fraction should be invariant to $\\phi_{\\mathrm{Lo}}$ is false for any finite partition coefficient $K_{\\mathrm{Lo}} \\neq 1$. As shown in the derivation, the DRM fraction $f_{P, \\text{DRM}}$ is a function of the true Lo fraction $f_{P, \\text{Lo}}$, which itself is a function of $\\phi_{\\mathrm{Lo}}$. Only in the unrealistic limit of $K_{\\mathrm{Lo}} \\to \\infty$ does the dependency on $\\phi_{\\mathrm{Lo}}$ vanish. **Incorrect**.\n\nIn summary, option A is the only one that describes a scientifically rigorous calibration experiment as requested by the problem and provides the correct quantitative result consistent with the given parameters and first principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2952650"}, {"introduction": "Ultimately, the objective of studying lipid rafts is to understand their function in living cells, such as their proposed role in organizing signaling pathways.

Use the following foundational facts and definitions as your starting base for reasoning:\n\n- Lipid rafts are nanoscale, dynamic, liquid-ordered assemblies enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. Their integrity requires both components; acute cholesterol extraction disrupts liquid-ordered packing, and co-repletion with cholesterol restores it when properly reinserted into the plasma membrane.\n- Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) acutely extracts cholesterol from the plasma membrane; cholesterol-loaded cyclodextrin can orthogonally replete cholesterol. Not all sterols equivalently support liquid-ordered phase; for example, 7-ketocholesterol substitutes bulk sterol mass but weakly supports liquid-ordered packing.\n- Laurdan dye generalized polarization (GP) imaging reports on membrane lipid order; decreases in GP reflect loss of liquid-ordered character.\n- Detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) flotation enriches raft markers (for example, ganglioside GM1, flotillin), but detergent can induce artifacts; thus DRM analysis is supportive but not sole evidence.\n- Sphingolipid depletion via serine palmitoyltransferase inhibition (for example, myriocin) decreases sphingolipid synthesis; exogenous sphingomyelin can partially restore sphingolipid content.

The evaluation must be based on a set of provided foundational facts regarding lipid rafts, their manipulation, and associated measurement techniques. A correct pipeline must integrate perturbation, measurement, and rescue steps, while controlling for specificity and potential confounds.\n\nThe core principles for establishing raft dependence, as derived from the provided information, are:\n$1$. **Perturbation**: The structural integrity of the raft must be disrupted. This primarily involves the depletion of its essential components, cholesterol and sphingolipids. The effect of this perturbation must be confirmed with a direct biophysical measurement of membrane order, such as Laurdan Generalized Polarization (GP).\n$2$. **Measurement**: A quantitative and specific readout of the signaling pathway of interest must be performed. In this case, it is the phosphorylation of ERK (p-ERK), which must be normalized to total ERK levels to account for any changes in total protein.\n$3$. **Rescue**: The phenotype observed upon perturbation (e.g., loss of p-ERK signal) must be reversed by specifically restoring the depleted component. Crucially, the rescue must also be shown to restore the biophysical properties of the membrane (e.g., membrane order as measured by GP).\n$4$. **Orthogonal Control**: A critical component of a rescue experiment is a negative control that distinguishes between a specific biophysical requirement and a non-specific bulk effect. For cholesterol depletion, repletion with a sterol like $7$-ketocholesterol, which restores sterol mass but not the liquid-ordered phase, serves this purpose.\n$5$. **Specificity**: Since rafts are defined by both cholesterol and sphingolipids, a robust claim of raft dependence should ideally be supported by disrupting sphingolipid homeostasis as well, demonstrating a similar effect on the signaling outcome.\n$6$. **Confound Control**: The experimental manipulations, particularly with chemical inhibitors like MβCD, can have off-target effects. These must be rigorously controlled for. The problem statement itself lists cytotoxicity, endocytosis defects, and changes in receptor surface expression as key potential confounds.\n\nWe will now evaluate each proposed pipeline against these principles.\n\n**Option A: Acute perturbation–rescue with orthogonal sterol control and sphingolipid specificity, tied to membrane order readout and trafficking controls.**\n- **Perturbation**: Utilizes acute cholesterol extraction with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD). It correctly mandates quantification of both the chemical depletion (cholesterol assay, filipin) and the biophysical consequence (decrease in Laurdan GP). This is a strong start.\n- **Measurement**: Proposes quantifying phospho-ERK normalized to total ERK, which is the correct and rigorous method. It supplements this with advanced imaging (super-resolution microscopy) to probe TrkB nanoclustering, directly linking the macroscopic signaling measurement to the microscopic organization of the receptor. It correctly relegates detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) analysis to a supportive role, acknowledging its potential for artifacts.\n- **Rescue**: Implements a proper rescue with cholesterol-loaded MβCD, with the critical requirement of verifying the restoration of both cholesterol levels and membrane GP.\n- **Orthogonal Control**: Includes the ideal orthogonal control: repletion with $7$-ketocholesterol. This directly tests whether the liquid-ordered character of the membrane, rather than just the presence of a sterol, is necessary for signaling.\n- **Specificity Controls**: Addresses the role of sphingolipids by using myriocin to inhibit their synthesis. It correctly suggests avoiding acute sphingomyelinase due to confounding ceramide signaling. It also proposes a logical rescue strategy for sphingolipid depletion.\n- **Confound Controls**: Systematically addresses the main off-target effects mentioned in the problem statement: endocytosis (transferrin uptake), viability, and surface receptor levels (surface biotinylation).\n- **Conclusion**: This pipeline is exceptionally well-designed. It systematically links the chemical composition of the membrane (cholesterol, sphingolipids) to its biophysical state (GP) and demonstrates that the biological readout (p-ERK) tracks with this biophysical state through a rigorous perturbation-rescue-orthogonal control paradigm, while meticulously controlling for artifacts.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B: Chronic metabolic cholesterol perturbation with limited rescue and no membrane order readout.**\n- **Perturbation**: Uses chronic simvastatin treatment ($48\\,\\mathrm{h}$). This is a less direct method than acute extraction and carries a higher risk of pleiotropic cellular adaptations. A major flaw is the complete absence of any measurement of cholesterol content or membrane order.\n- **Measurement**: Measures total ERK instead of phospho-ERK. This is fundamentally incorrect, as signaling is mediated by phosphorylation, not changes in total protein levels.\n- **Rescue**: Rescue with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is plausible, but its effectiveness is not verified biophysically.\n- **Specificity Controls**: Uses acute bacterial sphingomyelinase. As explicitly stated in the problem's foundational facts, this generates ceramide, a potent signaling molecule, thus introducing a severe confound that makes interpretation impossible.\n- **Confound Controls**: Only considers cell viability, ignoring crucial factors like endocytosis and receptor expression.\n- **Conclusion**: This pipeline is deeply flawed. It measures the wrong parameter (total ERK), fails to verify its perturbation, uses a highly confounding specificity control, and lacks essential controls.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C: Detergent-based raft assignment without perturbation–rescue.**\n- **Perturbation/Rescue**: There are no perturbation or rescue steps. This experimental design is purely correlational, based on co-fractionation in a biochemical assay. It cannot establish a causal link between rafts and signaling.\n- **Measurement**: Relies entirely on DRM flotation. The problem statement explicitly warns that this method is prone to artifacts and should not be used as sole evidence.\n- **Specificity Controls**: The proposed control, tunicamycin treatment to inhibit glycosylation, is highly non-specific and only tangentially related to the core lipid composition of rafts.\n- **Conclusion**: This approach is outdated and scientifically weak. It fails to meet the basic requirements of a causal experiment (perturbation-rescue) and relies on an unreliable technique.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D: Acute cholesterol extraction with incomplete rescue and ceramide supplementation.**\n- **Perturbation**: Uses MβCD for a prolonged period ($30\\,\\mathrm{min}$), increasing the risk of off-target effects, without any confirmation of cholesterol depletion or GP change.\n- **Measurement**: Quantifies phospho-ERK without normalization to total ERK, which is poor quantitative practice.\n- **Rescue**: The proposed \"rescue\" is incubation with unloaded MβCD. This is nonsensical. Unloaded MβCD is the agent of cholesterol *extraction*; it does not perform a rescue. This demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the tool.\n- **Specificity Controls**: Uses C$6$-ceramide to \"mimic\" sphingolipid restoration. Ceramide is a distinct signaling molecule and does not restore sphingomyelin-dependent membrane properties. This introduces a confound, it is not a control.\n- **Conclusion**: This pipeline is based on a cascade of conceptual errors regarding the function of the reagents. The \"rescue\" and \"specificity control\" steps would invalidate any results obtained.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option E: Acute cholesterol extraction and overexpression-based sphingomyelin manipulation without orthogonal sterol rescue or membrane order readout.**\n- **Perturbation**: Uses MβCD but fails to verify its effect on cholesterol levels or membrane order.\n- **Measurement**: Lacks the key biophysical measurement (Laurdan GP) needed to link the perturbation to a change in membrane state.\n- **Rescue**: Employs a crude and unreliable method of cholesterol repletion (free cholesterol in ethanol) without a proper carrier. The success of this rescue is unverified. There is no orthogonal sterol rescue control.\n- **Specificity Controls**: None are proposed; it simply assumes sphingomyelin synthase 1 (SMS1) overexpression is a specific manipulation for rafts, which is an unproven assumption.\n- **Confound Controls**: Completely absent.\n- **Conclusion**: This pipeline is incomplete and lacks rigor. It omits essential verification steps, controls, and uses a suboptimal rescue strategy, failing to build a convincing case for raft dependence.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on this analysis, Pipeline A is the only option that presents a complete, rigorous, and logically sound experimental plan that adheres to the highest standards of scientific investigation for this question. It successfully integrates all the necessary components: a confirmed perturbation, a correct readout, a verified rescue, an orthogonal control, specificity controls, and confound controls.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2723806"}]}
