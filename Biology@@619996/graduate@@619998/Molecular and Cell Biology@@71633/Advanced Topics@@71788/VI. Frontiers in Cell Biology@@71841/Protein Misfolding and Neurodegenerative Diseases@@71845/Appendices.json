It requires the implementation and validation of a network diffusion model. We are tasked with determining an optimal diffusion scale parameter, $\\beta^\\star$, from a discrete set of candidates $\\mathcal{G}$, and evaluating the model's performance using $K$-fold cross-validation. I will now delineate the step-by-step procedure for solving this problem.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the mathematical model. The brain's anatomical network is represented by a symmetric adjacency matrix $A$, where $A_{ij} \\ge 0$ is the connection strength between region $i$ and region $j$. The propagation of misfolded proteins is governed by a linear diffusion equation on this graph. The evolution of the pathology concentration vector, $x$, is described by the graph heat equation.\n\nThe discrete form of the operator corresponding to the Laplacian is the graph Laplacian. We use the symmetric normalized graph Laplacian, defined as:\n$$L = I - D^{-1/2} A D^{-1/2}$$\nwhere $I$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix, and $D$ is the diagonal degree matrix with entries $D_{ii} = \\sum_{j} A_{ij}$. The term $D^{-1/2}$ represents the element-wise inverse square root of the diagonal entries of $D$. This formulation is valid provided no region is completely disconnected (i.e., all degrees are non-zero), a condition met by all provided test cases.\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by a seed vector $x_0$, where $(x_0)_i = 1$ for initially affected regions and $0$ otherwise. The solution to the graph heat equation describes the pathology concentration at a later 'time' or, more accurately, at a diffusion scale $\\beta \\ge 0$. This solution is given by the action of the matrix exponential of the Laplacian on the initial state:\n$$x(\\beta) = \\exp(-\\beta L) x_0$$\nThis equation models how the initial pathology at $x_0$ diffuses throughout the network over a scale $\\beta$.\n\nTo evaluate the model's predictions, we compare the predicted pathology vector $x(\\beta)$ to empirical staging data. The provided ordinal staging labels, $b$, where a smaller value indicates an earlier stage of pathology involvement, are converted into a quantitative target vector $y$. The transformation is $y_i = B + 1 - b_i$, where $B = \\max(b_i)$. This conversion ensures that a higher value in $y$ corresponds to earlier disease involvement, aligning it with the expectation that regions with higher concentration $x_i(\\beta)$ are affected earlier.\n\nThe goodness-of-fit is quantified using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, $\\rho_s$, between the model output $x(\\beta)$ and the target vector $y$. This non-parametric measure is appropriate for ordinal data as it is invariant to any monotonic rescaling of the data, assessing only the correspondence of their ranks. As stipulated, if the correlation is undefined for a given data subset (e.g., due to zero variance in one of the vectors), its value is taken to be $0$.\n\nThe core of the task is to find the optimal parameter $\\beta^\\star$ and assess the model's generalizability using $K$-fold cross-validation. The procedure unfolds as follows:\n\n1.  **Data Partitioning**: The $n$ brain regions are partitioned into $K$ disjoint folds. The $k$-th test fold consists of all indices $i$ such that $i \\pmod K = k$. The training set for fold $k$ is the complement of its test set.\n\n2.  **Hyperparameter Optimization**: We iterate through each candidate value $\\beta \\in \\mathcal{G}$. For each $\\beta$:\n    a.  Compute the pathology vector $x(\\beta) = \\exp(-\\beta L) x_0$. This calculation is performed once per $\\beta$ value. The matrix exponential $\\exp(-\\beta L)$ is computed using robust numerical library functions.\n    b.  For each of the $K$ folds, we compute the Spearman correlation between the components of $x(\\beta)$ and $y$ that correspond to the *training* indices of that fold.\n    c.  The cross-validated training score for $\\beta$ is the average of these $K$ training correlations.\n\n3.  **Optimal Parameter Selection**: The optimal parameter, $\\beta^\\star$, is the value in $\\mathcal{G}$ that yields the maximum cross-validated training score. Any ties are resolved by selecting the smallest $\\beta$ value.\n\n4.  **Performance Evaluation**: With the selected $\\beta^\\star$, we evaluate the model's predictive performance on the held-out test data.\n    a.  The pathology vector $x(\\beta^\\star)$ is used.\n    b.  For each of the $K$ folds, we compute the Spearman correlation between the components of $x(\\beta^\\star)$ and $y$ corresponding to the *test* indices of that fold.\n    c.  The final reported performance metric, $\\rho$, is the average of these $K$ test correlations.\n\nThis entire procedure is deterministic and will be applied to each test case provided. The final output for each case consists of the pair $(\\beta^\\star, \\rho)$, which are then aggregated into a single formatted list.\n\nThe implementation will rely on the `numpy` library for matrix operations and `scipy` for specialized functions, namely `scipy.linalg.expm` for the matrix exponential and `scipy.stats.spearmanr` for the correlation coefficient. Care will be taken to handle the case where `spearmanr` returns `NaN` for constant-valued input, setting the result to $0$ as per the problem specification.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.linalg import expm\nfrom scipy.stats import spearmanr\n\ndef process_case(A, seed_indices, b, K, G):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for one test case of the network diffusion model.\n\n    Args:\n        A (np.ndarray): Adjacency matrix of the graph.\n        seed_indices (set): Set of indices for the seed regions.\n        b (np.ndarray): Ordinal staging labels.\n        K (int): Number of folds for cross-validation.\n        G (list): Grid of candidate beta values.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the optimal beta (beta_star) and the mean\n               test Spearman correlation.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = A.shape[0]\n\n    # --- 1.
