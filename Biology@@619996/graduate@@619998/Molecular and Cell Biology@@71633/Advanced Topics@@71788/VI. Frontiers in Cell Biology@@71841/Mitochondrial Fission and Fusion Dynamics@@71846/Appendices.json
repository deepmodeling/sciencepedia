It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in quantitative cell biology, free of contradictions or ambiguities. The premises are sufficient to derive a unique solution. Extraneous information regarding the initial average mitochondrial number per cell does not invalidate the problem but represents a common feature of realistic problem contexts, requiring the identification of relevant parameters.\n\nThe task is to compute the net change in the total number of mitochondria in a population of cells over a specified duration. Let $N(t)$ be the total number of mitochondria across the entire cell population at time $t$. We are asked to find the total change, $\\Delta N_{total} = N(T) - N(0)$, where the observation period is $T = 30$ minutes.\n\nThe problem states that changes in mitochondrial number are due only to fission and fusion events.

All necessary parameters and definitions are provided, making the problem self-contained and well-posed. The language is objective and quantitative. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors that would preclude a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nLet us proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe dynamics of the number of edges, $E$, in the mitochondrial network are governed by the balance between edge creation via fusion and edge removal via fission. The rate of change of $E$ can be written as:\n$$ \\frac{dE}{dt} = R_{\\text{create}} - R_{\\text{remove}} $$\nwhere $R_{\\text{create}}$ is the total rate of edge creation and $R_{\\text{remove}}$ is the total rate of edge removal.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the rate of edge creation due to fusion is proportional to the fusion rate constant $k_{\\text{fus}}$, the number of mitochondria $N$, and a proportionality constant $s$. We can express this as:\n$$ R_{\\text{create}} = s \\cdot k_{\\text{fus}} \\cdot N $$\n\nThe rate of edge removal due to fission is stated to be proportional to the fission rate constant $k_{\\text{fis}}$ and the current number of edges $E$. This implies that each edge has an independent probability per unit time, $k_{\\text{fis}}$, of undergoing fission. The total rate is therefore:\n$$ R_{\\text{remove}} = k_{\\text{fis}} \\cdot E $$\n\nAt steady state, the number of edges is constant, meaning $\\frac{dE}{dt} = 0$. This leads to the condition:\n$$ R_{\\text{create}} = R_{\\text{remove}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the rates, we get:\n$$ s \\cdot k_{\\text{fus}} \\cdot N = k_{\\text{fis}} \\cdot E $$\n\nWe are interested in the normalized connectivity index $I$, which is defined in terms of the ratio $E/N$. Let us rearrange the steady-state equation to solve for this ratio:\n$$ \\frac{E}{N} = \\frac{s \\cdot k_{\\text{fus}}}{k_{\\text{fis}}} $$\n\nThe normalized connectivity index $I$ is defined as:\n$$ I \\equiv \\frac{2E/N}{2s} = \\frac{E/N}{s} $$\nThe term $2E/N$ represents the mean degree of a node in the network, a standard measure of connectivity.\n\nSubstituting our derived expression for $E/N$ into the definition of $I$, we obtain a simple relationship between the index and the kinetic rate constants:\n$$ I = \\frac{1}{s} \\left( \\frac{s \\cdot k_{\\text{fus}}}{k_{\\text{fis}}} \\right) = \\frac{k_{\\text{fus}}}{k_{\\text{fis}}} $$\nThis result shows that the problem-specific constant $s$ cancels out, and the normalized connectivity index is simply the ratio of the fusion rate constant to the fission rate constant.\n\nWe can now compute this index for each cell type, fibroblasts (fib) and neurons (neu), using the provided data.\nFor fibroblasts:\n$$ k_{\\text{fus}}^{\\text{fib}} = 0.05 \\ \\text{min}^{-1} $$\n$$ k_{\\text{fis}} = 0.04 \\ \\text{min}^{-1} $$\nTherefore,\n$$ I_{\\text{fib}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{fus}}^{\\text{fib}}}{k_{\\text{fis}}} = \\frac{0.05}{0.04} $$\n\nFor neurons:\n$$ k_{\\text{fus}}^{\\text{neu}} = 0.02 \\ \\text{min}^{-1} $$\n$$ k_{\\text{fis}} = 0.04 \\ \\text{min}^{-1} $$\nTherefore,\n$$ I_{\\text{neu}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{fus}}^{\\text{neu}}}{k_{\\text{fis}}} = \\frac{0.02}{0.04} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the difference $\\Delta I \\equiv I_{\\text{fib}} - I_{\\text{neu}}$.\n$$ \\Delta I = I_{\\text{fib}} - I_{\\text{neu}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{fus}}^{\\text{fib}}}{k_{\\text{fis}}} - \\frac{k_{\\text{fus}}^{\\text{neu}}}{k_{\\text{fis}}} $$\n$$ \\Delta I = \\frac{k_{\\text{fus}}^{\\text{fib}} - k_{\\text{fus}}^{\\text{neu}}}{k_{\\text{fis}}} $$\n\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ \\Delta I = \\frac{0.05 - 0.02}{0.04} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4} $$\nThe resulting difference is a dimensionless quantity, as expected, since the units of the rate constants ($\\text{min}^{-1}$) cancel.\n\n$$ \\Delta I = 0.75 $$\nThis concludes the derivation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.75}\n$$", "id": "2955141"}, {"introduction": "The most powerful models connect macroscopic phenomena to underlying molecular mechanisms.

Structural and biochemical studies indicate that GTP binding induces a tethering-competent conformation and that trans-dimerization requires the GTP-bound state on both opposing protomers. Consider a simplified kinetic description of mitochondrial network dynamics in which mitochondria interconvert between a fused network state and a fragmented state. Assume the following fundamental bases:\n- Outer membrane fusion is initiated by MFN2 trans-dimer formation, which is proportional to the product of the GTP-bound fractions on the two apposed membranes (by the law of mass action), and fusion transitions occur with a rate proportional to the abundance of such active trans-dimers.\n- Fission events are mediated by Dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) and occur with a rate that is independent of MFN2 status under the specified conditions.\n- At steady state, the fraction of mitochondria in the fused network is set by the balance of fusion and fission transition fluxes.\n\nIn wild-type cells under basal conditions, the measured fraction of mitochondria in the fused network is $2/3$. Now consider a point mutation in the MFN2 GTPase domain that reduces GTP binding by $50\\%$ at physiological guanosine triphosphate (GTP) concentration, without altering GTP hydrolysis kinetics, MFN2 expression level, DRP1 activity, or inner membrane fusion mediated by Optic atrophy 1 (OPA1).\n\nFrom structural considerations and first-principles kinetic balance, which of the following best predicts how this MFN2 mutation will shift the fusion equilibrium and mitochondrial network morphology?\n\nA.

It is a valid problem of biophysical modeling. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nLet $F$ be the fraction of mitochondria in the fused state and $f$ be the fraction in the fragmented state. By definition, $F + f = 1$.\nThe system is described by the reversible reaction:\n$$\n\\text{Fragmented} \\underset{R_{fission}}{\\stackrel{R_{fusion}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} \\text{Fused}\n$$\nThe flux from the fragmented to the fused state is $J_{fusion} = R_{fusion} \\cdot f$.\nThe flux from the fused to the fragmented state is $J_{fission} = R_{fission} \\cdot F$.\nAt a steady state, these fluxes are equal:\n$$\nR_{fusion} \\cdot f = R_{fission} \\cdot F\n$$\nSubstituting $f = 1 - F$, we get:\n$$\nR_{fusion} \\cdot (1 - F) = R_{fission} \\cdot F\n$$\nSolving for the steady-state fraction of fused mitochondria, $F$:\n$$\nF = \\frac{R_{fusion}}{R_{fusion} + R_{fission}}\n$$\nThe problem states that the fission rate, $R_{fission}$, is constant because DRP1 activity is unchanged. Let $R_{fission} = k_{fission}$.\n\nThe fusion rate, $R_{fusion}$, depends on the formation of MFN2 trans-dimers. This requires both opposing protomers to be GTP-bound. Let $p$ be the fraction of MFN2 that is GTP-bound on a given membrane. According to the law of mass action for a bimolecular event, the rate of forming an active trans-dimer is proportional to the product of the concentrations (or fractions) of the reactants. Therefore, the fusion rate is proportional to $p \\times p = p^2$.\nWe can write the fusion rate as $R_{fusion} = k_{fusion} \\cdot p^2$, where $k_{fusion}$ is a proportionality constant that depends on MFN2 expression levels, mitochondrial density, etc., which are assumed to be constant.\n\n**Wild-Type (WT) Condition**\nIn the wild-type case, let the GTP-bound fraction be $p_{WT}$. The rates are:\n$R_{fusion, WT} = k_{fusion} \\cdot (p_{WT})^2$\n$R_{fission, WT} = k_{fission}$\nThe given steady-state fused fraction is $F_{WT} = 2/3$.\n$$\nF_{WT} = \\frac{R_{fusion, WT}}{R_{fusion, WT} + R_{fission, WT}} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nThis implies $3 \\cdot R_{fusion, WT} = 2 \\cdot (R_{fusion, WT} + R_{fission, WT})$, which simplifies to:\n$$\nR_{fusion, WT} = 2 \\cdot R_{fission, WT}\n$$\nThis relationship establishes the basal balance between fusion and fission rates in wild-type cells.\n\n**Mutant Condition**\nThe mutation reduces GTP binding by $50\\%$. The new GTP-bound fraction, $p_{mut}$, is half of the wild-type fraction:\n$$\np_{mut} = 0.5 \\cdot p_{WT} = \\frac{1}{2} p_{WT}\n$$\nThe new fusion rate, $R_{fusion, mut}$, is:\n$$\nR_{fusion, mut} = k_{fusion} \\cdot (p_{mut})^2 = k_{fusion} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2} p_{WT}\\right)^2 = k_{fusion} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} (p_{WT})^2\n$$\nComparing this to the wild-type fusion rate:\n$$\nR_{fusion, mut} = \\frac{1}{4} R_{fusion, WT}\n$$\nThe fusion rate is reduced by a factor of $4$, to $25\\%$ of its original value. The fission rate remains unchanged: $R_{fission, mut} = R_{fission, WT}$.\n\nNow we calculate the new steady-state fused fraction, $F_{mut}$:\n$$\nF_{mut} = \\frac{R_{fusion, mut}}{R_{fusion, mut} + R_{fission, mut}}\n$$\nWe can substitute the rates in terms of the wild-type fission rate, $R_{fission, WT}$.\nWe know $R_{fusion, WT} = 2 \\cdot R_{fission, WT}$.\nSo, $R_{fusion, mut} = \\frac{1}{4} R_{fusion, WT} = \\frac{1}{4} (2 \\cdot R_{fission, WT}) = \\frac{1}{2} R_{fission, WT}$.\nPlugging this into the equation for $F_{mut}$:\n$$\nF_{mut} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} R_{fission, WT}}{\\frac{1}{2} R_{fission, WT} + R_{fission, WT}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} R_{fission, WT}}{\\frac{3}{2} R_{fission, WT}} = \\frac{1/2}{3/2} = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nThe predicted fused fraction in the mutant is $1/3$. A drop from $2/3$ to $1/3$ indicates a significant shift toward fragmentation, resulting in a mitochondrial network that is more punctate, with smaller and more numerous mitochondria.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Because trans-dimerization requires both protomers to be GTP-bound, halving the GTP-bound fraction on each membrane reduces the active trans-dimer pool to $25\\%$ of wild-type and thereby decreases the fusion transition rate by approximately $4$-fold. With fission unchanged, the steady-state fused fraction is expected to drop from $2/3$ to about $1/3$, yielding a more fragmented, punctate network with more numerous, smaller mitochondria and reduced connectivity.**\nThis option correctly identifies that the rate of trans-dimerization is proportional to the square of the GTP-bound fraction ($p^2$). A $50\\%$ reduction in $p$ leads to a rate proportional to $(0.5p)^2 = 0.25p^2$, which is a $4$-fold reduction. It then correctly calculates the new steady-state fraction to be $1/3$ starting from the WT fraction of $2/3$. The morphological description is a direct and accurate consequence of this quantitative shift.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The fusion transition rate scales linearly with the single-molecule GTP-bound fraction; therefore a $50\\%$ reduction in GTP binding decreases fusion by $50\\%$, lowering the fused fraction modestly from $2/3$ to $1/2$, with mild shortening but preserved network connectivity.**\nThis option incorrectly assumes a linear scaling of the fusion rate with the GTP-bound fraction. The problem states that trans-dimerization requires the GTP-bound state on *both* protomers, which under the law of mass action implies a quadratic ($p^2$) dependence, not linear ($p$). This assumption is fundamentally incorrect. If the rate were to decrease by $50\\%$, the new fraction would indeed be $F_{mut} = \\frac{0.5 \\cdot R_{fusion, WT}}{0.5 \\cdot R_{fusion, WT} + R_{fission, WT}} = \\frac{0.5 \\cdot (2 R_{fission, WT})}{0.5 \\cdot (2 R_{fission, WT}) + R_{fission, WT}} = \\frac{R_{fission, WT}}{R_{fission, WT} + R_{fission, WT}} = 1/2$. While the calculation based on the faulty premise is correct, the initial premise violates the problem statement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Fusion is limited by GTP hydrolysis rather than binding; thus a $50\\%$ reduction in GTP binding does not materially affect fusion kinetics or morphology, which remain elongated and highly interconnected as in wild-type.**\nThis option introduces an external assumption that fusion is limited by GTP hydrolysis, which contradicts the premises. The problem explicitly links fusion initiation to the formation of trans-dimers from GTP-bound protomers, making GTP binding a critical step for the rate. It also states the mutation *does not* affect hydrolysis but *does* affect binding, so an effect is expected. The conclusion of no change is therefore baseless.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Inner membrane fusion via OPA1 fully compensates for reduced MFN2 GTP binding at the outer membrane, shifting the balance toward hyperfusion and increasing the fused fraction above $2/3$.**\nThis option is illogical. Outer membrane fusion is a prerequisite for inner membrane fusion. Impairing the first step (MFN2-mediated fusion) cannot be compensated for by a subsequent step (OPA1-mediated fusion). Furthermore, the problem explicitly states that OPA1 activity is unaltered. There is no basis for a compensatory mechanism, and the prediction of hyperfusion contradicts the known effect of inhibiting a key fusion protein.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Reduced GTP binding promotes MFN2 clustering that enhances tethering independent of nucleotide state, increasing the effective fusion rate and raising the fused fraction from $2/3$ to roughly $3/4$, producing a hyperfused network.**\nThis option invents a mechanism (\"clustering... independent of nucleotide state\") that is not supported by the problem statement and directly contradicts the given rule that the tethering-competent state is induced by GTP binding. As with option D, it baselessly predicts an increase in fusion (hyperfusion), which is the opposite of the expected outcome.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2955142"}]}
