{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Before we can appreciate the complexity of active transport, we must first understand the default mechanism: passive diffusion. This exercise asks you to calculate the mean first passage time (MFPT), a crucial metric that quantifies the average time it takes for a diffusing particle, such as a messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complex, to find a target. By applying the principles of diffusion theory to a simplified model of a cell, you will gain a quantitative intuition for why diffusion alone is often insufficient for rapid and reliable mRNA localization, thereby motivating the need for active, motor-driven processes [@problem_id:2956111].", "problem": "An individual messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complex is synthesized near the center of a spherical cell and localizes to the cell cortex via passive diffusion in the absence of advection.

The model is a standard and valid simplification used in quantitative biology. The problem is well-posed, providing a clear differential equation (implied via Fick's law), geometry, boundary conditions, and initial position, which together define a unique solution. All parameters are given, and the language is objective and precise. The numerical values provided for $D$ and $R$ are biologically plausible. The problem is not ill-posed, incomplete, or contradictory.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe probability density $p(\\mathbf{r}, t|\\mathbf{r}_0)$ for a particle undergoing diffusion with coefficient $D$ is governed by Fick's second law, which is the diffusion equation. The relevant form here is the backward Kolmogorov equation, which describes the evolution of the probability density with respect to the initial position $\\mathbf{r}_0$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p(\\mathbf{r}, t|\\mathbf{r}_0)}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla_0^2 p(\\mathbf{r}, t|\\mathbf{r}_0) $$\nwhere $\\nabla_0^2$ is the Laplacian operator with respect to the initial coordinates $\\mathbf{r}_0$. Due to the spherical symmetry of the problem (start at center, spherical boundary, isotropic diffusion), the probability density and all derived quantities will depend only on the radial distance from the center, $r=|\\mathbf{r}_0|$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p(r, t)}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla^2 p(r, t) = D \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r^2 \\frac{\\partial p(r, t)}{\\partial r} \\right) $$\nHere, we use the form where the Laplacian acts on the initial radial coordinate $r$.\n\nThe survival probability $S(t|r)$ is the probability that a particle starting at a distance $r$ from the center has not yet reached the absorbing boundary at radius $R$ by time $t$. It is obtained by integrating the probability density over the volume of the sphere $\\Omega$:\n$$ S(t|r) = \\int_{\\Omega} p(\\mathbf{r}', t|\\mathbf{r}) dV' $$\nIntegrating the backward diffusion equation over the spatial domain $\\Omega$ for the final position gives the evolution equation for the survival probability:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial S(t|r)}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla^2 S(t|r) $$\nThe mean first passage time (MFPT), $T(r)$, for a particle starting at $r$ is the expected value of the first passage time. The distribution of first passage times $f(t|r)$ is related to the survival probability by $f(t|r) = -\\frac{dS(t|r)}{dt}$. The MFPT is then:\n$$ T(r) = \\int_0^\\infty t f(t|r) dt = -\\int_0^\\infty t \\frac{dS(t|r)}{dt} dt $$\nIntegrating by parts, we get:\n$$ T(r) = -\\left[t S(t|r)\\right]_0^\\infty + \\int_0^\\infty S(t|r) dt $$\nThe term $[t S(t|r)]_0^\\infty$ vanishes because $S(t \\to \\infty)=0$ (absorption is certain) and $t=0$. This leaves:\n$$ T(r) = \\int_0^\\infty S(t|r) dt $$\nNow, we derive the differential equation for $T(r)$. We integrate the equation for $S(t|r)$ with respect to time from $t=0$ to $t=\\infty$:\n$$ \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\partial S(t|r)}{\\partial t} dt = \\int_0^\\infty D \\nabla^2 S(t|r) dt $$\nThe left-hand side (LHS) evaluates to:\n$$ \\text{LHS} = [S(t|r)]_0^\\infty = S(\\infty|r) - S(0|r) = 0 - 1 = -1 $$\nThis is because at $t=0$, the particle is within the domain, so $S(0|r)=1$. At $t=\\infty$, the particle has been absorbed, so $S(\\infty|r)=0$.\nThe right-hand side (RHS) becomes:\n$$ \\text{RHS} = D \\nabla^2 \\left( \\int_0^\\infty S(t|r) dt \\right) = D \\nabla^2 T(r) $$\nEquating the LHS and RHS gives the Poisson equation for the MFPT $T(r)$:\n$$ D \\nabla^2 T(r) = -1 $$\nThis is the general equation for the MFPT in a domain with absorbing boundaries.\n\nFor our specific problem with spherical symmetry, we write the Laplacian in spherical coordinates. The boundary value problem (BVP) for $T(r)$ is:\n1.  **Differential Equation**:\n    $$ D \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dT}{dr} \\right) = -1 $$\n2.  **Boundary Conditions**:\n    -   At the absorbing boundary $r=R$, the time to reach the boundary is zero. Thus, $T(R)=0$.\n    -   At the center $r=0$, the solution must be regular. Due to spherical symmetry, the gradient of the MFPT must be zero, $\\frac{dT}{dr}\\Big|_{r=0} = 0$.\n\nWe solve this BVP by direct integration. First, rearrange the equation:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dT}{dr} \\right) = -\\frac{r^2}{D} $$\nIntegrating with respect to $r$:\n$$ r^2 \\frac{dT}{dr} = \\int -\\frac{r^2}{D} dr = -\\frac{r^3}{3D} + C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is an integration constant. Applying the symmetry condition at $r=0$:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dr} = -\\frac{r}{3D} + \\frac{C_1}{r^2} $$\nFor the derivative to be finite (specifically, zero) at $r=0$, we must have $C_1=0$.\nSo, the equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dr} = -\\frac{r}{3D} $$\nIntegrating again with respect to $r$:\n$$ T(r) = \\int -\\frac{r}{3D} dr = -\\frac{r^2}{6D} + C_2 $$\nwhere $C_2$ is the second integration constant. We find $C_2$ using the absorbing boundary condition $T(R)=0$:\n$$ 0 = T(R) = -\\frac{R^2}{6D} + C_2 \\implies C_2 = \\frac{R^2}{6D} $$\nSubstituting $C_2$ back gives the solution for the MFPT as a function of the starting radius $r$:\n$$ T(r) = \\frac{R^2 - r^2}{6D} $$\nThe problem asks for the MFPT starting from the center of the cell, which corresponds to $r=0$.\n$$ T(0) = \\frac{R^2}{6D} $$\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the given values $R = 10 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $D = 0.05 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$.\n$$ T(0) = \\frac{(10 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m})^2}{6 \\times (0.05 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\!/\\mathrm{s})} = \\frac{100 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m}^2}{0.3 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\!/\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{1000}{3} \\, \\mathrm{s} $$\nNumerically, this is approximately $333.333... \\, \\mathrm{s}$. Rounding to three significant figures, we get $333 \\, \\mathrm{s}$.\n\nFinally, for the qualitative discussion of how $T(0)$ depends on $D$: The derived expression is $T(0) = \\frac{R^2}{6D}$. This shows that the mean first passage time from the center to the cortex is inversely proportional to the diffusion coefficient $D$. This relationship is physically intuitive: a higher diffusion coefficient means the particle moves more rapidly and explores the available space more quickly. Consequently, on average, it will take less time to find and be absorbed by the boundary. Therefore, as $D$ increases, $T(0)$ decreases.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{333} $$", "id": "2956111"}, {"introduction": "Having established that passive diffusion can be too slow for efficient localization in large cells, we now turn to active transport, where motor proteins function as dedicated cargo haulers.

Before any solution is attempted, the problem statement is validated and found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and containing sufficient information for a unique solution.\n\nThe physical context is intracellular transport, which occurs in the low-Reynolds-number regime. In this regime, inertial forces are negligible compared to viscous forces, leading to an overdamped system. The equation of motion is not Newton's second law in its familiar form ($F=ma$), but rather a force balance equation, where the sum of all forces acting on the object is zero at all times.\n$$ \\sum \\vec{F} = \\vec{0} $$\nThe ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granule is subject to a propulsive force, $\\vec{F}_{\\text{prop}}$, generated by the ensemble of $N$ dynein motors, and a resistive viscous drag force, $\\vec{F}_{\\text{drag}}$, from the cytoplasm.

Each dynein motor has a stall force, $F_s$, which is the maximum force it can generate. At this maximum force, the motor's velocity is zero; it is stalled. The problem requires determining the number of motors needed to *sustain motion* at a non-zero speed $v$. For motion to occur, the load on each individual motor must be strictly less than its stall force. If the load were equal to the stall force, the motors would stall, and the velocity would be zero, contradicting the condition of sustained motion.

By reasoning through how microtubule depolymerization (with nocodazole) versus stabilization (with taxol) affects different classes of localized mRNAs, you will develop a deeper understanding of how these intricate transport systems are investigated and understood.", "problem": "A polarized cell can be idealized along a one-dimensional axis with position $x \\in [0,L]$, where $x=0$ corresponds to the perinuclear region near the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) and $x=L$ corresponds to the cell cortex. Microtubules are oriented with their minus-ends near the MTOC and plus-ends toward the cortex. Consider $3$ distinct classes of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) cargos that localize via different microtubule-dependent mechanisms:\n\n- Class $I$ (kinesin lattice-transport, plus-end-directed): an mRNA–messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complex recruits a plus-end-directed kinesin motor and moves along microtubule lattices toward $x=L$ with an effective drift $v_{\\text{eff}}0$, superimposed on cytoplasmic diffusion with coefficient $D0$. Upon reaching the cortex, the mRNA can be anchored with rate $k_{\\text{a}}0$, leading to accumulation near $x=L$.\n\n- Class $II$ (dynein lattice-transport, minus-end-directed): an mRNP recruits cytoplasmic dynein and moves toward $x=0$ with $v_{\\text{eff}}0$, again with diffusion $D0$, and is retained near the perinuclear region by tethering with rate $k_{\\text{t}}0$.\n\n- Class $III$ (plus-end tracking protein-mediated tip-transport): an mRNP associates with growing microtubule plus-ends via plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs; for example, End Binding protein $1$ (EB1) and Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC)) and is delivered to the cortex predominantly by riding on growing ends. The delivery flux scales with the density of growing ends and their growth parameters, such that $J_{\\text{end}}\\propto \\rho_{+}\\,v_{g}$, where $\\rho_{+}$ is the number density of actively growing plus-ends reaching the cortex per unit time and $v_{g}0$ is the plus-end growth speed; cortical capture occurs with rate $k_{\\text{c}}0$.\n\nAssume motors can move along any existing microtubule lattice regardless of whether microtubules are dynamic, whereas Class $III$ requires plus-end growth to generate delivery events.

The problem is therefore valid and can be solved through rigorous deduction from the provided principles.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by evaluating the impact of each drug on the three distinct mRNA localization mechanisms.\n\n**Baseline Localization (No Drug Treatment)**\n\nIn the absence of drugs, each mRNA class establishes a characteristic non-uniform steady-state distribution.\n- **Class $I$ (kinesin-based):** An mRNP complex is transported by plus-end-directed kinesin motors along microtubule lattices toward the cell cortex at $x=L$. This corresponds to a system with advection (drift) with velocity $v_{\\text{eff}} > 0$ and diffusion with coefficient $D$. Coupled with an anchoring process at the cortex (rate $k_{\\text{a}}$), this active transport leads to a sustained accumulation, or enrichment, of Class $I$ mRNA near $x=L$.\n- **Class $II$ (dynein-based):** An mRNP complex is transported by minus-end-directed dynein motors toward the perinuclear region at $x=0$. This is modeled as advection with velocity $v_{\\text{eff}}  0$. Tethering at $x=0$ (rate $k_{\\text{t}}$) ensures the accumulation of Class $II$ mRNA near the perinuclear region.\n- **Class $III$ (+TIP-based):** An mRNP complex is delivered to the cortex by associating with the tips of actively growing microtubules. Its delivery flux to the cortex, $J_{\\text{end}}$, is proportional to the density of growing microtubule ends $\\rho_{+}$ and their growth speed $v_{g}$, i.e., $J_{\\text{end}} \\propto \\rho_{+} v_{g}$. Capture at the cortex (rate $k_{\\text{c}}$) leads to an enrichment of Class $III$ mRNA near $x=L$.\n\n**Effect of Nocodazole Treatment**\n\nNocodazole is a microtubule depolymerizing agent, which leads to a rapid reduction in the density of polymerized microtubules, $\\rho_{\\text{MT}} \\approx 0$.\n- **Impact on Class $I$ and Class $II$**: Both kinesin and dynein are motor proteins that require microtubule polymers as tracks for their movement. The elimination of these tracks ($\\rho_{\\text{MT}} \\approx 0$) abolishes all motor-dependent transport. Consequently, the effective drift velocity for both classes becomes zero, $v_{\\text{eff}} = 0$. The system dynamics are reduced to pure diffusion. In the absence of directed transport to counteract diffusion, any pre-existing concentration gradients will dissipate. The steady-state distribution for both Class $I$ and Class $II$ mRNA will become uniform (or \"broadly distributed\") throughout the domain $[0,L]$. Therefore, both classes lose their characteristic enrichment.\n- **Impact on Class $III$**: This mechanism depends on delivery by *growing* microtubule plus-ends. If microtubules are depolymerized, there are no growing ends. Thus, the density of growing ends $\\rho_{+} \\to 0$, which in turn causes the delivery flux to vanish, $J_{\\text{end}} \\to 0$. The specific localization mechanism is eliminated. As with the other classes, the mRNA will redistribute via diffusion, and its peripheral enrichment will be lost.\n- **Conclusion for Nocodazole**: All three classes ($I$, $II$, and $III$) lose their localization and become broadly distributed throughout the cell.\n\n**Effect of Taxol Treatment**\n\nTaxol is a microtubule stabilizing agent. It suppresses microtubule dynamic instability, meaning the growth speed $v_{g} \\approx 0$ and rescue/catastrophe frequencies are near zero. However, it preserves the existing polymer lattice.\n- **Impact on Class $I$ and Class $II$**: The transport of these classes depends on the presence of microtubule lattices, not on their dynamics. Taxol preserves and stabilizes these lattices. Therefore, the tracks for kinesin and dynein motors remain intact and fully functional. The directed transport with $v_{\\text{eff}} > 0$ for Class $I$ and $v_{\\text{eff}}  0$ for Class $II$ continues. Consequently, both Class $I$ and Class $II$ mRNA retain their respective enrichments at the cortex ($x=L$) and the perinuclear region ($x=0$).\n- **Impact on Class $III$**: The transport of this class is fundamentally dependent on microtubule *growth*. The delivery flux is given as $J_{\\text{end}} \\propto \\rho_{+} v_{g}$. Since taxol sets the growth speed $v_{g} \\approx 0$, the delivery flux is abolished, $J_{\\text{end}} \\to 0$. The mechanism coupling the mRNA to +TIPs is specific to the conformation of a growing microtubule end (the GTP-tubulin cap), which is lost on stabilized microtubules. Thus, the delivery mechanism is specifically inhibited. The mRNA loses its peripheral enrichment and becomes broadly distributed by diffusion.\n- **Conclusion for Taxol**: Class $I$ and Class $II$ retain their localization, whereas Class $III$ loses its localization.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n- **A. Under nocodazole, Classes $I$–$III$ maintain their respective localizations because diffusion and cortical capture are sufficient; under taxol, Classes $I$–$III$ all retain localization since tracks remain.**\n  This is **Incorrect**. Under nocodazole, all transport mechanisms are abolished, leading to a loss of localization for all classes. Diffusion alone leads to homogenization, not maintenance of a gradient. Under taxol, Class $III$ loses localization.\n\n- **B. Under nocodazole, Classes $I$–$III$ all lose their characteristic enrichments (redistributing broadly) because $\\rho_{\\text{MT}}\\approx 0$ eliminates both lattice transport and end-tracking; under taxol, Class $I$ (kinesin lattice-transport to $x=L$) and Class $II$ (dynein lattice-transport to $x=0$) retain their enrichments because motors move on stabilized lattices, whereas Class $III$ loses peripheral enrichment because $v_{g}\\approx 0$ abolishes plus-end delivery ($J_{\\text{end}}\\to 0$).**\n  This is **Correct**. This statement accurately summarizes the deduced consequences for both drug treatments. Nocodazole globally disrupts all microtubule-dependent processes. Taxol selectively disrupts the process dependent on microtubule dynamics ($v_g$) while preserving those dependent only on the static lattice.\n\n- **C. Under nocodazole, Classes $I$ and $II$ retain localization via diffusion–capture, whereas Class $III$ loses enrichment; under taxol, Class $I$ loses enrichment due to “paralyzed” kinesin on stable lattices, but Classes $II$ and $III$ retain localization.**\n  This is **Incorrect**. Under nocodazole, classes $I$ and $II$ also lose localization. Under taxol, Class $I$ retains localization (kinesin is not paralyzed), and Class $III$ loses it.\n\n- **D. Under nocodazole, Class $II$ retains perinuclear enrichment because minus-ends reside at $x=0$ even without microtubules, while Classes $I$ and $III$ lose enrichment; under taxol, Class $III$ retains peripheral enrichment because stabilized plus-ends substitute for growth, while Class $I$ loses enrichment due to impaired lattice transport.**\n  This is **Incorrect**. Under nocodazole, the transport machinery for Class $II$ (dynein on tracks) is gone, so localization is lost. The MTOC at $x=0$ is not a track. Under taxol, Class $III$ loses enrichment because stabilized ends are not equivalent to growing ends for +TIP binding. Class $I$ retains its enrichment.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2956187"}]}
