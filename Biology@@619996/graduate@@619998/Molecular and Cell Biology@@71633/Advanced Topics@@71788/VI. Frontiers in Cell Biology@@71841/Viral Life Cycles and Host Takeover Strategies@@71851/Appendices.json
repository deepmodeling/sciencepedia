A self-sustaining state can emerge only if the zero-RNA state becomes unstable.\n\nA steady state $(X^*, Y^*)$ is a point where $\\frac{dX}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dY}{dt} = 0$. By inspection of the system of equations, the point $(X^*, Y^*) = (0, 0)$ is always a steady state for any parameter values.

In eukaryotic cap-dependent initiation, the scanning preinitiation complex binds the five-prime cap and scans in the five-prime to three-prime direction, initiating translation upon recognizing a start codon (AUG) with a context-dependent probability. Under a leaky scanning regime, some scanning complexes bypass suboptimal start codons without initiating.\n\nAssume the following, consistent with the canonical scanning model and steady-state mass-action reasoning:\n- Each scanning event is independent and ends upon initiation at any AUG (no reinitiation).\n- The upstream AUG is encountered first and is recognized with per-encounter initiation probability $p_1$.\n- Conditional on not initiating at the upstream AUG, a scanning complex that reaches the downstream AUG initiates there with conditional probability $p_2$.\n- The rate of protein production from an ORF is proportional to the probability that a scanning complex initiates at that ORF, and mRNA abundance and elongation do not limit initiation.\n\nGiven $p_1=0.3$ and $p_2=0.7$, do the following:\n1.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular virology and population genetics (quasispecies theory). The setup describes a standard, well-posed probabilistic model based on independent Bernoulli trials. The language is objective and precise, and all necessary parameters and assumptions for a unique solution are provided. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, we proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the fraction of progeny genomes that contain zero mutations in a specified lethal subset of sites. This is a classic problem in probability theory.\n\nLet us define the event of a single nucleotide at a specific site being copied correctly as a success. The probability of this success is $p = 1 - \\mu$, where $\\mu$ is the per-nucleotide error probability. Consequently, the probability of failure (a mutation occurring at that site) is $\\mu$. The problem focuses on a subset of $U$ sites where a mutation is lethal. The survival of the progeny requires that all $U$ of these sites are copied correctly.\n\nThe assumption that each nucleotide is copied independently allows us to model this process as a series of $U$ independent Bernoulli trials. For a progeny genome to be viable (i.e., contain zero mutations in the lethal subset), it must experience a success in each of these $U$ trials. The probability of this compound event is the product of the probabilities of the individual independent events.\n\nLet $F_0$ be the fraction of progeny with zero mutations in the lethal subset. This is equivalent to the probability of this outcome for a single replication event. Thus, the exact expression is:\n$$F_0 = (1-\\mu) \\times (1-\\mu) \\times \\dots \\times (1-\\mu) \\quad (U \\text{ times})$$\n$$F_0 = (1-\\mu)^{U}$$\n\nThe problem specifies that we should derive an *approximate* expression, leveraging the condition $\\mu \\ll 1$. For a small value $x$, the exponential function has the well-known Taylor series approximation $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1-x$. We can apply this approximation in reverse.\nWe have $1 - \\mu$, which for $\\mu \\ll 1$, is approximately equal to $\\exp(-\\mu)$. Substituting this into our exact expression for $F_0$:\n$$F_0 = (1-\\mu)^{U} \\approx (\\exp(-\\mu))^{U}$$\n$$F_0 \\approx \\exp(-\\mu U)$$\nThis is the required approximate expression for the fraction of progeny genomes that are viable. This expression is the probability of zero events occurring in a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda = \\mu U$, which is the expected number of mutations in the lethal subset. This approximation is valid when $U$ is large and $\\mu$ is small, which are the conditions given.\n\nNext, we address the role of the total genome length, $L$. The derivation above only uses the parameters $\\mu$ and $U$. The parameter $L$ does not appear in the final expression. This is because the problem explicitly defines the lethal criterion as being contingent *only* on mutations occurring within the lethal subset of size $U$. Mutations in the remaining $L-U$ non-lethal sites are stated to have no effect on the viability of the progeny in the context of this problem. Therefore, the total genome length $L$ is extraneous information for the specific question asked.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the expression numerically using the provided values: $\\mu = 10^{-4}$ and $U = 1000$.\nThe product $\\mu U$ is the expected number of lethal mutations per replication:\n$$\\mu U = (10^{-4}) \\times (1000) = 10^{-4} \\times 10^{3} = 10^{-1} = 0.1$$\nNow, we substitute this value into our approximate expression:\n$$F_0 \\approx \\exp(-0.1)$$\nCalculating the value of $\\exp(-0.1)$:\n$$\\exp(-0.1) \\approx 0.904837418...$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$F_0 \\approx 0.9048$$\nThis is the numerical fraction of progeny genomes that are expected to have zero mutations in the lethal subset after one round of replication.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.9048}\n$$", "id": "2968036"}]}
