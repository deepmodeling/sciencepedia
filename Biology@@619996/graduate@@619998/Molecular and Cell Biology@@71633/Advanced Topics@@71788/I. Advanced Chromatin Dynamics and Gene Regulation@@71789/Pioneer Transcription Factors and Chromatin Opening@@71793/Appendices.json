It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. We may proceed.\n\nThe task is to estimate the fraction of time a specific deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) motif on a nucleosome is exposed. This is a problem in equilibrium statistical mechanics. The fraction of time the system spends in a given macrostate is equivalent to the probability of finding the system in that macrostate at thermal equilibrium. This probability is determined by the Boltzmann distribution.\n\nThe problem requires us to model the system as a two-state equilibrium between a \"not fully exposed\" macrostate and an \"exposed-by-at-least $\\ell$\" macrostate. This is a partition of the total configuration space. Let us first define the microscopic states. A microscopic state is defined by the number of base pairs, $n$, unwrapped from the DNA entry-exit point. We assume the free energy of unwrapping is a linear function of this length: $\\Delta G(n) = k_G n$, where $n$ is the number of unwrapped base pairs and $k_G$ is the free energy cost per base pair. The ground state, with $n=0$ (fully wrapped), has a reference free energy of $0$.\n\nThe problem states that the free energy cost is $\\Delta G_u = 2.5\\,\\text{kcal mol}^{-1}$ per $10\\,\\text{bp}$. From this, we determine the constant $k_G$:\n$$k_G = \\frac{2.5\\,\\text{kcal mol}^{-1}}{10\\,\\text{bp}} = 0.25\\,\\text{kcal mol}^{-1}\\text{bp}^{-1}$$\nThe probability of a given microscopic state $n$ is proportional to its Boltzmann factor, $\\exp(-\\Delta G(n) / (RT))$, where $R$ is the molar gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Note that $R$ must be used instead of the Boltzmann constant $k_B$ because the energy units are per mole.\n\nFirst, we determine the minimum unwrapping length, $\\ell$, required for the transcription factor (TF) to bind. The motif has a length of $w = 15\\,\\text{bp}$ and its center is located at a distance $d = 30\\,\\text{bp}$ from the DNA entry-exit point. Assuming the motif is a linear segment, it occupies the region from $(d - w/2)$ to $(d + w/2)$. The problem states that full exposure requires unwrapping to the inner edge of the motif, which is the edge farther from the entry-exit point.\n$$\\ell = d + \\frac{w}{2} = 30\\,\\text{bp} + \\frac{15\\,\\text{bp}}{2} = 30\\,\\text{bp} + 7.5\\,\\text{bp} = 37.5\\,\\text{bp}$$\n\nThe free energy cost to expose the motif, which we denote $\\Delta G_{\\text{expose}}(\\ell)$, corresponds to the energy required to unwrap this length $\\ell$:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\text{expose}}(\\ell) = k_G \\times \\ell = (0.25\\,\\text{kcal mol}^{-1}\\text{bp}^{-1}) \\times (37.5\\,\\text{bp}) = 9.375\\,\\text{kcal mol}^{-1}$$\n\nNow, we must correctly formulate the fraction of time the motif is exposed. This corresponds to the probability that the system is in any state $n$ where $n \\ge \\ell$. The \"exposed-by-at-least $\\ell$\" macrostate is the set of all microscopic states $\\{n | n \\ge \\ell\\}$. The \"not fully exposed\" macrostate is the set of all states $\\{n | 0 \\le n < \\ell\\}$. The total partition function $Z_{\\text{total}}$ is the sum of Boltzmann factors over all possible states, from $n=0$ to a maximum unwrapping length $N$.\n$$Z_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{n=0}^{N} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G(n)}{RT}\\right) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_G n}{RT}\\right)$$\nLet $x = \\exp(-k_G / (RT))$. Then $Z_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{n=0}^{N} x^n$.\nThe partition function for the exposed macrostate, $Z_{\\text{exposed}}$, is the sum over states where $n \\ge \\ell$:\n$$Z_{\\text{exposed}} = \\sum_{n=\\ell}^{N} x^n$$\nThe fraction of time the motif is exposed, $f_{\\text{exposed}}$, is the ratio of the partition function of the exposed macrostate to the total partition function:\n$$f_{\\text{exposed}} = \\frac{Z_{\\text{exposed}}}{Z_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{\\sum_{n=\\ell}^{N} x^n}{\\sum_{n=0}^{N} x^n}$$\nThese are geometric series. The sum is $\\sum_{k=a}^{b} r^k = \\frac{r^a - r^{b+1}}{1-r}$.\n$$Z_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{1 - x^{N+1}}{1-x}$$\n$$Z_{\\text{exposed}} = \\frac{x^{\\ell} - x^{N+1}}{1-x}$$\nTherefore,\n$$f_{\\text{exposed}} = \\frac{x^{\\ell} - x^{N+1}}{1 - x^{N+1}}$$\nWe must make an assumption about $N$. A typical nucleosome wraps approximately $147\\,\\text{bp}$, so the maximum unwrapping from one end is $N \\approx 73\\,\\text{bp}$. We will see that $x < 1$, and thus for large $N$, the term $x^{N+1}$ becomes negligible. It is a standard and reasonable assumption in such models to treat the sum as if $N \\to \\infty$. In this limit, $x^{N+1} \\to 0$ (since $x<1$). The expression for the fraction simplifies considerably:\n$$f_{\\text{exposed}} \\approx \\frac{x^{\\ell}}{1} = x^{\\ell} = \\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_G}{RT}\\right)\\right)^{\\ell} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_G \\ell}{RT}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\text{expose}}(\\ell)}{RT}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value.

Provide a final expression for the steady-state accessibility $A^\\ast$.\n\nThe problem is now validated against the specified criteria.\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is scientifically grounded. It employs the principles of mass-action kinetics and first-order rate laws to model a well-established biological phenomenon: the dynamic opening and closing of chromatin, mediated by pioneer transcription factors. Such modeling is a standard and valid approach in quantitative molecular biology. The assumptions are simplifications but are physically and biologically plausible within the context of a minimal model.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. The provided information is sufficient and consistent for constructing a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $A(t)$. The analysis of such an equation is a standard mathematical procedure that leads to a unique, stable, and meaningful solution.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and mathematical language, free of any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, and well-structured. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. We may now proceed to the solution.\n\nFirst, we construct the differential equation for the accessibility $A(t)$. The rate of change of the open fraction, $\\frac{dA}{dt}$, is the difference between the rate of opening and the rate of closing.\nThe rate of opening is the flux from the closed state to the open state. Based on the problem statement, this flux is proportional to the TF concentration $P(t)$ and the fraction of the locus that is closed, $1-A(t)$. The rate is thus given by $k_o P(t) (1-A(t))$.\nThe rate of closing is the flux from the open state to the closed state. This is a spontaneous first-order process with rate constant $k_c$, so the rate is given by $k_c A(t)$.\nCombining these terms, the net rate of change of $A(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of opening}) - (\\text{Rate of closing}) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the rates and the condition $P(t) = P_0$:\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = k_o P_0 (1 - A(t)) - k_c A(t) $$\nThis is the required ordinary differential equation for $A(t)$.\n\nSecond, we must show that the interval $[0,1]$ is forward invariant for any initial condition $A(0) \\in [0,1]$. This means that if the accessibility starts within its physically meaningful range, it will remain there for all future times $t > 0$. We examine the behavior of the system at the boundaries of this interval.\nAt the lower boundary, $A=0$:\n$$ \\left. \\frac{dA}{dt} \\right|_{A=0} = k_o P_0 (1 - 0) - k_c (0) = k_o P_0 $$\nSince $k_o$ is a rate constant and $P_0$ is a concentration, both are non-negative. Thus, $k_o P_0 \\ge 0$. This implies that if $A(t)$ reaches $0$, its rate of change is non-negative, meaning the trajectory cannot exit the interval $[0,1]$ through the lower boundary.\nAt the upper boundary, $A=1$:\n$$ \\left. \\frac{dA}{dt} \\right|_{A=1} = k_o P_0 (1 - 1) - k_c (1) = -k_c $$\nSince $k_c$ is a rate constant, it is non-negative. Thus, $-k_c \\le 0$. This implies that if $A(t)$ reaches $1$, its rate of change is non-positive, meaning the trajectory cannot exit the interval $[0,1]$ through the upper boundary.\nSince the vector field on the boundary of the interval $[0,1]$ points into the interval (or is zero), the interval is forward invariant.\n\nThird, we determine the steady state(s) and their stability. A steady state, denoted by $A^\\ast$, is a value of $A$ for which the system does not change over time, i.e., $\\frac{dA}{dt} = 0$.\nSetting the ODE to zero:\n$$ 0 = k_o P_0 (1 - A^\\ast) - k_c A^\\ast $$\n$$ 0 = k_o P_0 - k_o P_0 A^\\ast - k_c A^\\ast $$\n$$ k_o P_0 = (k_o P_0 + k_c) A^\\ast $$\nSolving for $A^\\ast$:\n$$ A^\\ast = \\frac{k_o P_0}{k_o P_0 + k_c} $$\nFor a dynamic system where chromatin state can change, we must assume that both opening and closing can occur, which implies $k_o > 0$ and $k_c > 0$. Under these physically non-trivial conditions, the denominator $k_o P_0 + k_c$ is strictly positive for any non-negative $P_0$. Therefore, there exists a unique steady state for any given set of parameters.\n\nTo analyze the stability of this unique steady state, let us define the function $f(A) = k_o P_0 - (k_o P_0 + k_c)A$. The ODE is $\\frac{dA}{dt} = f(A)$. The stability is determined by the sign of the derivative $f'(A)$ at the steady state $A^\\ast$.\n$$ f'(A) = \\frac{d}{dA} \\left[ k_o P_0 - (k_o P_0 + k_c)A \\right] = -(k_o P_0 + k_c) $$\nSince $k_o > 0$, $k_c > 0$, and $P_0 \\ge 0$, the sum $k_o P_0 + k_c$ is strictly positive. Therefore, $f'(A) < 0$ for all values of $A$. This indicates that the steady state $A^\\ast$ is not only locally asymptotically stable but, because the derivative is negative everywhere, it is globally asymptotically stable. Any initial condition $A(0) \\in [0,1]$ will lead to the solution $A(t)$ that converges to $A^\\ast$ as $t \\to \\infty$. The system is robustly drawn to this single equilibrium.\n\nFinally, the problem requires the explicit closed-form analytic function for the unique steady-state accessibility $A^\\ast$. This was derived during the stability analysis. The expression is:\n$$ A^\\ast = \\frac{k_o P_0}{k_o P_0 + k_c} $$\nThis expression is physically sensible. It correctly shows that $A^\\ast$ is a monotonically increasing function of the pioneer TF concentration $P_0$, varying between $A^\\ast=0$ when $P_0=0$ and approaching $A^\\ast=1$ as $P_0 \\to \\infty$. The expression demonstrates a hyperbolic saturation behavior characteristic of systems with binding or catalytic steps, where $k_c/k_o$ acts as an effective half-saturation constant for the TF.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{k_o P_0}{k_o P_0 + k_c}}$$", "id": "2959351"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical models become truly powerful when connected to experimental observation; here, we will bridge our understanding of pioneer TF binding to a widely used experimental technique, Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq).

The derived formula is $p_{\\text{est}} = 1 - \\frac{DE}{\\beta}$. Inflating $p_{\\text{est}}$ means that the measured term $\\frac{DE}{\\beta}$ is artificially low.

Thus, an inflated $p$ estimate results from any mechanism that artificially suppresses the observed core cut rate $\\lambda_c^{\\text{obs}}$ or artificially inflates the expected unbound core cut rate $\\beta\\lambda_f$. Two such mechanisms are:\n\n$1$. **Nucleosome Occlusion**: The model assumes that motifs not bound by the TF are in a single \"unbound\" and accessible state. However, a fraction of these TF-unbound motifs may be occluded by nucleosomes. Nucleosomes strongly protect DNA from transposase cleavage. This protection in the core of TF-unbound motifs would lower the measured $\\lambda_c^{\\text{obs}}$, which the model would misinterpret as protection due to TF binding, thus inflating the estimated fraction $p$.\n\n$2$. **Intrinsic Transposase Sequence Aversion**: The model uses a single multiplicative factor, $\\beta$, to account for sequence bias, measured on naked DNA. The Tn$5$ transposase has complex sequence preferences. If the specific sequence of the motif core is intrinsically highly disfavored for cleavage, creating a \"cold spot\" that is deeper than what is captured by the average factor $\\beta$, the observed $\\lambda_c^{\\text{obs}}$ will be lower than expected for the unbound state. This intrinsic lack of cutting is again misattributed to TF-mediated protection, leading to an overestimation of $p$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.500}$$", "id": "2959373"}]}
