Consider a coarse-grained additive model in which oriented CTCF occupancy contributes to insulation by acting as a barrier to cohesin-mediated loop extrusion, and cohesin occupancy contributes additively to local boundary strength. Specifically, suppose that over a cluster of $n$ candidate anchor sites, the oriented CTCF contribution is proportional to the window-integrated Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) signal only when the CTCF motif orientation is convergent with respect to the insulated side, while cohesin (measured via the RAD21 subunit ChIP-seq) contributes regardless of orientation.

Pol II initiates at the promoter with rate $k_{\\mathrm{init}}$, enters a promoter-proximal paused state, and then either releases into productive elongation with rate $k_{\\mathrm{rel}}$ or undergoes premature termination (abortive loss) from the paused state with rate $k_{\\mathrm{abort}}$. Assume steady state, a single paused state, first-order transitions, and that each elongating Pol II traverses the gene body with residence time $L/v$. The steady-state nascent transcript flux (the rate of productive entries into the gene body) equals the rate at which paused Pol II release into productive elongation.\n\nBaseline PRO-seq measurements for this gene report a promoter-proximal pausing index of $4$. After acute CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) targeting a distal enhancer linked to this gene, the pausing index increases to $8$. An independent assay reports that, at baseline, the fraction of paused Pol II that terminates prematurely rather than entering productive elongation is $f_{\\mathrm{abort}} = 0.3$. Assume that the enhancer perturbation affects only the pause-release rate $k_{\\mathrm{rel}}$ and leaves $k_{\\mathrm{init}}$, $k_{\\mathrm{abort}}$, $v$, and $L$ unchanged. Take $L = 60 \\ \\mathrm{kb}$ and $v = 2 \\ \\mathrm{kb} \\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n\nUsing only the steady-state definitions above and mass-action reasoning, answer the following:\n\n1) From the observed increase in the pausing index upon enhancer perturbation, infer whether the enhancer primarily modulates initiation or pause release.\n\n2) Compute the expected fold-change in the steady-state nascent transcript flux after enhancer perturbation relative to baseline, expressed as a dimensionless decimal. Round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a simplified but standard kinetic model of transcription elongation control, providing sufficient and consistent information to answer the questions posed. The problem is valid.\n\nWe begin by formalizing the kinetic model of transcription described. Let $N_p$ be the number of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) molecules in the promoter-proximal paused state at steady state. The flux into this state is the initiation rate, given as $k_{\\mathrm{init}}$ (units of polymerases per time). Pol II exits this state either by productive release into the gene body, with a first-order rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{rel}}$, or by premature termination, with a first-order rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{abort}}$. The total rate of exit from the paused state is $(k_{\\mathrm{rel}} + k_{\\mathrm{abort}})N_p$. At steady state, the rate of entry equals the rate of exit:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{init}} = (k_{\\mathrm{rel}} + k_{\\mathrm{abort}})N_p$$\nFrom this, we can express the steady-state number of paused polymerases as:\n$$N_p = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{init}}}{k_{\\mathrm{rel}} + k_{\\mathrm{abort}}}$$\n\nNext, let $N_g$ be the number of elongating Pol II molecules within the gene body at steady state. The flux of Pol II into the gene body is the productive release from the paused state, $J = k_{\\mathrm{rel}}N_p$. Each polymerase transcribes a gene of length $L$ at a constant speed $v$, so the residence time in the gene body is $T_g = L/v$. At steady state, the number of polymerases in the gene body is the product of the flux into the gene body and the residence time:\n$$N_g = J \\times T_g = (k_{\\mathrm{rel}}N_p) \\left(\\frac{L}{v}\\right)$$\n\nThe promoter-proximal pausing index, $PI$, is defined as the ratio of PRO-seq density in the promoter-proximal window to that in the gene body, normalized by window lengths. Let the PRO-seq signal be proportional to the number of Pol II molecules. If we denote the proximal window length as $w_p$ and the gene body length as $L$, the densities are $\\rho_p \\propto N_p/w_p$ and $\\rho_g \\propto N_g/L$. The most plausible interpretation of the phrase \"normalized by window lengths\" that yields a solvable problem consistent with all givens (specifically, the inclusion of $L$ and $v$) is that the pausing index represents the ratio of the total number of polymerases in the two regions. That is, $PI = (\\rho_p w_p) / (\\rho_g L) \\propto N_p/N_g$. Taking the ratio of our expressions for $N_p$ and $N_g$:\n$$\\frac{N_p}{N_g} = \\frac{N_p}{(k_{\\mathrm{rel}}N_p)(L/v)} = \\frac{v}{k_{\\mathrm{rel}}L}$$\nTherefore, we establish the expression for the pausing index as:\n$$PI = \\frac{v}{k_{\\mathrm{rel}}L}$$\n\n1) Inference of enhancer function:\nThe problem asks to infer whether the enhancer modulates initiation ($k_{\\mathrm{init}}$) or pause release ($k_{\\mathrm{rel}}$). The parameters $v$ and $L$ are given as constants. Our expression for the pausing index, $PI = v/(k_{\\mathrm{rel}}L)$, depends only on $k_{\\mathrm{rel}}$. If the enhancer perturbation only affected the initiation rate $k_{\\mathrm{init}}$, the pausing index $PI$ would remain unchanged. However, the data show that the pausing index increases from a baseline of $PI_1 = 4$ to $PI_2 = 8$ after enhancer perturbation. This change can only be explained by a change in $k_{\\mathrm{rel}}$. Since $PI$ is inversely proportional to $k_{\\mathrm{rel}}$, the observed increase in $PI$ implies a decrease in $k_{\\mathrm{rel}}$. The CRISPRi perturbation is inhibitory. This means that inhibiting the enhancer leads to a decrease in the pause-release rate. Consequently, the normal biological function of the enhancer is to promote pause release, i.e., to increase $k_{\\mathrm{rel}}$. The enhancer primarily modulates pause release.\n\n2) Computation of fold-change in nascent transcript flux:\nThe nascent transcript flux, $J$, is the rate of productive entry into the gene body, which is $J = k_{\\mathrm{rel}}N_p$. Substituting the expression for $N_p$:\n$$J = k_{\\mathrm{rel}} \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{init}}}{k_{\\mathrm{rel}} + k_{\\mathrm{abort}}}\\right) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{init}} k_{\\mathrm{rel}}}{k_{\\mathrm{rel}} + k_{\\mathrm{abort}}}$$\nWe need to compute the fold-change $J_2/J_1$, where subscript $1$ denotes baseline and subscript $2$ denotes the post-perturbation state. The problem assumes $k_{\\mathrm{init}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{abort}}$ are constant.\n$$\\frac{J_2}{J_1} = \\frac{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{init}} k_{\\mathrm{rel},2}}{k_{\\mathrm{rel},2} + k_{\\mathrm{abort}}}}{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{init}} k_{\\mathrm{rel},1}}{k_{\\mathrm{rel},1} + k_{\\mathrm{abort}}}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{rel},2}}{k_{\\mathrm{rel},1}} \\cdot \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{rel},1} + k_{\\mathrm{abort}}}{k_{\\mathrm{rel},2} + k_{\\mathrm{abort}}}$$\nWe must find the relationships between the rate constants. From the pausing index data:\n$$PI_1 = \\frac{v}{k_{\\mathrm{rel},1}L} = 4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad PI_2 = \\frac{v}{k_{\\mathrm{rel},2}L} = 8$$\nTaking the ratio $\\frac{PI_2}{PI_1} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{rel},1}}{k_{\\mathrm{rel},2}}$, we find $\\frac{8}{4} = 2$, so $k_{\\mathrm{rel},1} = 2k_{\\mathrm{rel},2}$, or $k_{\\mathrm{rel},2} = \\frac{1}{2}k_{\\mathrm{rel},1}$.\n\nNext, we use the information that the baseline fraction of paused Pol II that terminates, $f_{\\mathrm{abort}}$, is $0.3$. This fraction is the ratio of the rate of abortion to the total rate of exit from the paused state:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{abort}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{abort}} N_p}{(k_{\\mathrm{rel},1} + k_{\\mathrm{abort}})N_p} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{abort}}}{k_{\\mathrm{rel},1} + k_{\\mathrm{abort}}} = 0.3$$\nSolving for $k_{\\mathrm{abort}}$ in terms of $k_{\\mathrm{rel},1}$:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{abort}} = 0.3(k_{\\mathrm{rel},1} + k_{\\mathrm{abort}})$$\n$$k_{\\mathrm{abort}} = 0.3k_{\\mathrm{rel},1} + 0.3k_{\\mathrm{abort}}$$\n$$0.7k_{\\mathrm{abort}} = 0.3k_{\\mathrm{rel},1}$$\n$$k_{\\mathrm{abort}} = \\frac{0.3}{0.7}k_{\\mathrm{rel},1} = \\frac{3}{7}k_{\\mathrm{rel},1}$$\n\nNow we substitute these relations for $k_{\\mathrm{rel},2}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{abort}}$ into the flux fold-change expression:\n$$\\frac{J_2}{J_1} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}k_{\\mathrm{rel},1}}{k_{\\mathrm{rel},1}} \\cdot \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{rel},1} + \\frac{3}{7}k_{\\mathrm{rel},1}}{\\frac{1}{2}k_{\\mathrm{rel},1} + \\frac{3}{7}k_{\\mathrm{rel},1}}$$\n$$\\frac{J_2}{J_1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{rel},1}(1 + \\frac{3}{7})}{k_{\\mathrm{rel},1}(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{7})} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{10}{7}}{\\frac{7}{14} + \\frac{6}{14}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{10}{7}}{\\frac{13}{14}}$$\n$$\\frac{J_2}{J_1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{10}{7} \\cdot \\frac{14}{13} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{10 \\cdot 2}{13} = \\frac{10}{13}$$\nAs a decimal rounded to four significant figures, this is:\n$$\\frac{J_2}{J_1} \\approx 0.769230... \\approx 0.7692$$\nThe fold-change in the steady-state nascent transcript flux is $0.7692$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7692}$$", "id": "2942986"}]}
