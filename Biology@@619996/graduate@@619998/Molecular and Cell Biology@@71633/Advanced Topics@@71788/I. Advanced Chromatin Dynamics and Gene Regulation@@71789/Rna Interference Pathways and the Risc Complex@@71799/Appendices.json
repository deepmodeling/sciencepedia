The parameters are realistic. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The phrasing \"Boltzmann weight of its end instability\" implies that the probability of selection increases with higher free energy ($\\Delta G$), which is a known feature of guide strand selection. This can be modeled by defining the effective \"energy\" of the selection state as being inversely proportional to the thermodynamic stability of the duplex end. Thus, the problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Solution**\n\nThe solution proceeds by first calculating the local free energy of base-pairing for the $5^{\\prime}$ end of each strand, then calculating the difference, and finally using this difference in a Boltzmann-derived probability model.\n\nFirst, we determine the free energy of the sense strand's $5^{\\prime}$ end, $\\Delta G_{\\text{sense }5^{\\prime}\\text{ end}}$. The duplex at this end is:\n$$\n5^{\\prime}\\text{-GC...}\\\\\n3^{\\prime}\\text{-CG...}\n$$\nThe first base-pair step is given as $\\mathrm{GC/CG}$.

The duplex at this end is formed by the $5^{\\prime}$ end of the antisense strand and the $3^{\\prime}$ end of the sense strand. The sequences are:\n$$\n\\text{...UA-}3^{\\prime} \\quad (\\text{Sense})\\\\\n\\text{...AU-}5^{\\prime} \\quad (\\text{Antisense})\n$$\nThe problem specifies the first base-pair step at the antisense $5^{\\prime}$ end is $\\mathrm{UA/AU}$. The free energy for this step is $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{37}(\\mathrm{UA/AU}) = -1.33\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$. The terminal base pair at this end is an $A\\!-\\!U$ pair.

This means the probability of selection, $P_i$, is an increasing function of its associated end energy, $\\Delta G_i$. The model specifies that this probability is proportional to the Boltzmann weight of its \"instability\". If we define instability as being proportional to $\\Delta G$, then the probability of selecting strand $i$ would be proportional to $\\exp(+\\Delta G_i/(RT))$, which contrasts with the usual $\\exp(-\\Delta G_i/(RT))$ for thermally populated states. In a two-state system (antisense is guide vs. sense is guide), the probability that the antisense strand is the guide, $P_{\\text{AS}}$, is given by the normalized partition function:\n$$\nP_{\\text{AS}} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\text{AS}}}{RT}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\text{AS}}}{RT}\\right) + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\text{S}}}{RT}\\right)}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta G_{\\text{AS}}$ and $\\Delta G_{\\text{S}}$ are the end energies for the antisense and sense strands, respectively.

In this scenario, the rate-limiting step for turnover at saturation is the forward conformational change, $k_{a}$. Once the RISC complex adopts the active conformation $ES^{\\ast}$, it proceeds to catalysis almost instantaneously.

No extra whitespace or text is permitted in the output line.", "solution": "The problem requires the design of a computational filter for small interfering RNA (siRNA) candidates based on first principles of molecular biology and equilibrium thermodynamics. The filter must be implemented as a sequential decision process where a candidate must pass all criteria to be accepted. We will formalize each step of the filter as specified.\n\nThe filter evaluates a candidate based on five inputs: the on-target binding free energy $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{on}}$, a list of off-target binding free energies $\\{\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{off},j}\\}$, a conservation score $C$, and boolean flags for seed pairing ($b_{\\mathrm{seed}}$) and central pairing ($b_{\\mathrm{central}}$).\n\nThe decision process consists of three sequential stages:\n1. Slicing Prerequisites\n2. Conservation Requirement\n3. Thermodynamic Selectivity\n\nA candidate must pass all three stages. Failure at any stage results in immediate rejection.\n\n**Stage 1: Slicing Prerequisites**\nThis stage is based on the biological principle that endonucleolytic cleavage by the Argonaute protein, a core component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), is critically dependent on structural features of the guide-target duplex. Specifically, both efficient recognition via seed pairing and cleavage-competent conformation via central pairing are required.\nThe filter formalizes this as a strict logical AND condition. The candidate is rejected if either of these pairings is absent.\n- A candidate must have $b_{\\mathrm{seed}} = \\mathrm{true}$.\n- A candidate must have $b_{\\mathrm{central}} = \\mathrm{true}$.\nIf ($b_{\\mathrm{seed}} = \\mathrm{false}$) OR ($b_{\\mathrm{central}} = \\mathrm{false}$), the candidate fails.\n\n**Stage 2: Conservation Requirement**\nThis stage is based on the evolutionary principle that functionally important nucleic acid sequences tend to be conserved across species. A high conservation score for a target site suggests functional relevance, making it a more desirable target for therapeutic intervention.\nThe filter formalizes this with a minimum threshold on the conservation score $C$.\n- A candidate must have $C \\ge 0.7$.\nIf this condition is not met, the candidate fails.\n\n**Stage 3: Thermodynamic Selectivity**\nThis stage quantifies the trade-off between on-target efficacy and off-target side effects using principles of statistical mechanics. We model the system as a set of mutually exclusive states in thermodynamic equilibrium at a physiological temperature $T = 310$ $\\mathrm{K}$: the siRNA is unbound, bound to its intended on-target mRNA, or bound to one of several off-target mRNAs.\n\nAccording to the Boltzmann distribution, the probability of the system occupying a state $i$ with free energy $\\Delta G_i$ is proportional to its Boltzmann weight, $w_i = \\exp(-\\Delta G_i / (RT))$, where $R = 1.987 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{kcal} \\cdot \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ is the molar gas constant. The product $RT$ is calculated as:\n$$RT = (1.987 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{kcal} \\cdot \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-1}) \\times (310 \\, \\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.61597 \\, \\mathrm{kcal} \\cdot \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$$\n\nThe states and their statistical weights are:\n- **Unbound state**: This is the reference state with $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{unbound}} = 0$. Its weight is $w_{\\mathrm{unbound}} = \\exp(-0 / (RT)) = 1$.\n- **On-target bound state**: The weight is $w_{\\mathrm{on}} = \\exp(-\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{on}} / (RT))$.\n- **Off-target bound states**: For each off-target $j$, the weight is $w_{\\mathrm{off},j} = \\exp(-\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{off},j} / (RT))$.\n\nThe partition function, $Z$, is the sum of the weights of all possible states. It serves as a normalization constant.\n$$Z = w_{\\mathrm{unbound}} + w_{\\mathrm{on}} + \\sum_{j} w_{\\mathrm{off},j} = 1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{on}}}{RT}\\right) + \\sum_{j} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{off},j}}{RT}\\right)$$\n\nThe occupancy probability of any given state is its weight divided by the partition function. We are interested in two key quantities:\n- **On-target occupancy ($p_{\\mathrm{on}}$)**: The probability that the siRNA is bound to its intended target.\n  $$p_{\\mathrm{on}} = \\frac{w_{\\mathrm{on}}}{Z} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{on}} / (RT))}{Z}$$\n- **Maximum off-target occupancy ($p_{\\mathrm{off}}^{\\max}$)**: The highest probability of being bound to any single off-target site.\n  $$p_{\\mathrm{off}}^{\\max} = \\max_{j} \\left\\{ \\frac{w_{\\mathrm{off},j}}{Z} \\right\\} = \\frac{\\max_{j}\\{w_{\\mathrm{off},j}\\}}{Z}$$\nIf the set of off-targets is empty, the summation term $\\sum_{j} w_{\\mathrm{off},j}$ is zero, and as per the problem specification, we set $p_{\\mathrm{off}}^{\\max} = 0$.\n\nThe selectivity requirements are:\n- $p_{\\mathrm{on}} \\ge 0.9$ (high on-target engagement)\n- $p_{\\mathrm{off}}^{\\max} \\le 0.1$ (low probability of any single dominant off-target effect)\n\nIf either of these thermodynamic conditions is not met, the candidate fails.\n\n**Final Decision**\nA candidate is deemed to \"pass\" (output: `true`) if and only if it satisfies all conditions from all three stages.
