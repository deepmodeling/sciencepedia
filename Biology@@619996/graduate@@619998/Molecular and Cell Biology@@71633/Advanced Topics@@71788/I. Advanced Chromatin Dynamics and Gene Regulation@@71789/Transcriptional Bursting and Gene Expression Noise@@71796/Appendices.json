The central biological question is whether a simple constant-rate transcription model (independent and identically distributed Poisson counts per cell) suffices, or whether promoter switching and transcriptional bursting are required to explain the data. From first principles, the Poisson model with constant rate implies that for a count random variable $Y$ in any cell, $\\mathbb{E}[Y]=\\operatorname{Var}(Y)$, while two-state promoter bursting can be represented as a mixture of Poisson processes across time or cell states, producing overdispersed counts (for example, a negative binomial distribution) with $\\operatorname{Var}(Y)>\\mathbb{E}[Y]$. Formulate a one-sided hypothesis test grounded in these principles to decide between:\n- $H_{0}$: independent Poisson counts with a single unknown rate common to all cells,\n- $H_{1}$: overdispersed counts consistent with bursty transcription.\n\nYou are given the following smFISH dataset as a frequency table of mRNA counts per cell:\n- For each count $k \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\\}$, the number of cells with that count is $n_{k}$, with\n  - $n_{0}=5$,\n  - $n_{1}=11$,\n  - $n_{2}=3$,\n  - $n_{3}=11$,\n  - $n_{4}=10$,\n  - $n_{5}=5$,\n  - $n_{6}=1$,\n  - $n_{7}=3$,\n  - $n_{8}=1$.\n\nUse only the defining property of the Poisson model under $H_{0}$ and large-sample asymptotics to construct a test statistic that compares the sample variance to the sample mean, and specify its null reference distribution. Then compute the value of this test statistic for the dataset above.

This statistical test must be grounded in the fundamental properties of the Poisson distribution.\n\nLet the random variable $Y$ denote the mRNA count in a single cell. We are given a sample of $n$ independent and identically distributed observations, $Y_1, Y_2, \\ldots, Y_n$. The hypothesis test is formulated as follows:\n\nThe null hypothesis, $H_{0}$, posits that the cell-to-cell counts follow a Poisson distribution with a single, unknown rate parameter $\\lambda$. A defining characteristic of the Poisson distribution is the equality of its mean and variance.\n$$ H_{0}: Y_i \\sim \\text{i.i.d. Poisson}(\\lambda) \\implies \\mathbb{E}[Y] = \\operatorname{Var}(Y) = \\lambda $$\nThe alternative hypothesis, $H_{1}$, corresponds to the case of overdispersion, where the variance is strictly greater than the mean. This is the statistical signature of bursty transcription.\n$$ H_{1}: \\operatorname{Var}(Y) > \\mathbb{E}[Y] $$\nThis sets up a one-sided hypothesis test.\n\nTo construct an appropriate test statistic, we use the sample estimators for the population mean and variance. The population mean $\\mathbb{E}[Y]$ is estimated by the sample mean $\\bar{Y}$:\n$$ \\bar{Y} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i $$\nThe population variance $\\operatorname{Var}(Y)$ is estimated by the unbiased sample variance $S^2$:\n$$ S^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \\bar{Y})^2 $$\nA logical test statistic compares these two estimators. The standard statistic for this is Fisher's index of dispersion, which we will denote by $D$. It is defined as the sum of squared deviations from the mean, normalized by the sample mean:\n$$ D = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \\bar{Y})^2}{\\bar{Y}} = \\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\\bar{Y}} $$\nUnder the null hypothesis $H_0$, and invoking large-sample asymptotics as specified, the statistic $D$ follows a chi-squared distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom. The null reference distribution is therefore:\n$$ D \\sim \\chi^2_{n-1} $$\nA value of $D$ significantly larger than its expectation under $H_0$, which is $n-1$, provides evidence to reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_1$.\n\nWe now proceed to calculate the value of $D$ using the provided frequency table of smFISH counts: $n_{0}=5$, $n_{1}=11$, $n_{2}=3$, $n_{3}=11$, $n_{4}=10$, $n_{5}=5$, $n_{6}=1$, $n_{7}=3$, and $n_{8}=1$.\n\nFirst, the total number of cells, $n$, in the sample is the sum of the frequencies:\n$$ n = \\sum_{k=0}^{8} n_k = 5 + 11 + 3 + 11 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 50 $$\nNext, we calculate the sample mean, $\\bar{Y}$. This is computed from the frequency table as:\n$$ \\bar{Y} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=0}^{8} k \\cdot n_k $$\nThe sum of all observed mRNA counts is:\n$$ \\sum_{k=0}^{8} k \\cdot n_k = (0 \\cdot 5) + (1 \\cdot 11) + (2 \\cdot 3) + (3 \\cdot 11) + (4 \\cdot 10) + (5 \\cdot 5) + (6 \\cdot 1) + (7 \\cdot 3) + (8 \\cdot 1) $$\n$$ \\sum_{k=0}^{8} k \\cdot n_k = 0 + 11 + 6 + 33 + 40 + 25 + 6 + 21 + 8 = 150 $$\nThus, the sample mean is:\n$$ \\bar{Y} = \\frac{150}{50} = 3 $$\nNow we must compute the sum of squared deviations from the mean, $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \\bar{Y})^2$. A computationally efficient formula is $\\sum(Y_i - \\bar{Y})^2 = (\\sum Y_i^2) - n\\bar{Y}^2$.
