This practice guides you through building a mathematical model from first principles to understand how DNA methylation patterns are inherited—or diluted—over successive generations. By formalizing the process of semi-conservative replication and the imperfect efficiency of the maintenance methyltransferase $DNMT1$, you will derive the dynamics of passive demethylation [@problem_id:2943478].", "problem": "A population of mammalian cells undergoes repeated cell divisions. Consider a single, representative cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dyad and model its methylation state across divisions under purely passive demethylation in the presence of partial inhibition of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). Assume the following mechanistic facts as the fundamental base:\n\n- DNA replication is semi-conservative, producing two daughter duplexes from each parental duplex during the synthesis phase (S phase).\n- A CpG dyad can exist in one of three states: fully methylated ($M$), hemimethylated ($H$), or unmethylated ($U$).\n- Passive demethylation arises because only pre-existing methylation on the parental strand is present immediately after replication; there is no de novo methylation and no active demethylation.\n- DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1), the maintenance methyltransferase, acts on hemimethylated dyads during S phase to methylate the nascent unmethylated cytosine on the daughter strand. Let $p \\in [0,1]$ denote the per-dyad probability that DNMT1 successfully converts a hemimethylated dyad to a fully methylated dyad during a given S phase. DNMT1 acts independently at each hemimethylated dyad.\n- There is no selection; the states are tracked as probabilities (fractions) per daughter dyad.\n\nAt the start (before the first S phase), the CpG dyad is fully methylated with probability $1$ (that is, $M=1$, $H=0$, $U=0$). Let $t \\in \\mathbb{N}$ denote the number of completed divisions. Define the methylation level $L_t$ as the expected fraction of methylated cytosines per CpG dyad on both strands after $t$ divisions, that is, $L_t = M_t + \\frac{1}{2} H_t$, where $M_t$ and $H_t$ are the probabilities that the dyad is fully methylated or hemimethylated, respectively, after $t$ divisions.\n\nTasks:\n1. Using only the assumptions above, derive how the abundance of hemimethylated dyads changes over one S phase in the presence of maintenance efficiency $p$. Carefully justify the steps from semi-conservative replication to post-maintenance outcomes.\n2. From first principles, build the generational recurrence for $L_t$ and solve it in closed form to predict the time course of methylation loss across $t$ divisions.\n\nFor grading, report only the final closed-form expression for $L_t$ in terms of $p$ and $t$. No numerical evaluation is required, and no units are needed.", "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of DNA replication and maintenance methylation, well-posed with clear definitions and initial conditions, and formulated with objective, formal language. It presents a solvable problem in theoretical molecular biology without any internal contradictions, factual unsoundness, or ambiguity. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nLet $M_t$, $H_t$, and $U_t$ be the respective probabilities that a given CpG dyad is fully methylated, hemimethylated, or unmethylated after $t$ completed cell divisions. The state probabilities must sum to unity for all $t$: $M_t + H_t + U_t = 1$. The process of advancing from generation $t$ to $t+1$ involves two sequential events within the S phase: semi-conservative DNA replication followed by maintenance methylation activity.\n\nFirst, we analyze the effect of semi-conservative replication on the distribution of methylation states. Each dyad from generation $t$ produces two daughter dyads.\n- A fully methylated ($M$) dyad, with both strands methylated, replicates to form two identical hemimethylated ($H$) daughter dyads. Each new duplex consists of one methylated parental strand and one unmethylated nascent strand.\n- A hemimethylated ($H$) dyad has one methylated and one unmethylated strand. Replication of the methylated parental strand produces one hemimethylated ($H$) daughter dyad. Replication of the unmethylated parental strand produces one unmethylated ($U$) daughter dyad.\n- An unmethylated ($U$) dyad replicates to form two identical unmethylated ($U$) daughter dyads.\n\nLet us denote the proportions of states immediately after replication, but before maintenance methylation, as $M'$, $H'$, and $U'$. Since the total number of dyads doubles, we can write the new proportions based on the fate of the parent population proportions ($M_t$, $H_t$, $U_t$):\n- The new population of hemimethylated dyads arises from all daughters of parent $M$ dyads and half the daughters of parent $H$ dyads. Thus, the proportion is $H' = \\frac{2 M_t + 1 H_t}{2} = M_t + \\frac{1}{2} H_t$.\n- The new population of unmethylated dyads arises from half the daughters of parent $H$ dyads and all daughters of parent $U$ dyads. Thus, the proportion is $U' = \\frac{1 H_t + 2 U_t}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} H_t + U_t$.\n- No fully methylated dyads are produced directly by replication, so $M' = 0$.\n\nSecond, we model the action of the maintenance methyltransferase, DNMT1. DNMT1 acts exclusively on the newly formed hemimethylated dyads ($H'$) and attempts to methylate the cytosine on the nascent strand. This process has a success probability of $p$ for each site.\n- A fraction $p$ of the $H'$ dyads are successfully converted to the fully methylated ($M$) state.\n- The remaining fraction, $1-p$, of the $H'$ dyads fail to be methylated and remain in the hemimethylated ($H$) state.\n- Unmethylated dyads ($U'$) are not substrates for DNMT1 and remain unchanged.\n\nThis allows us to write the state probabilities for the next generation, $t+1$, in terms of the proportions at generation $t$.\nThe proportion of fully methylated dyads at $t+1$ is:\n$$M_{t+1} = p H' = p \\left( M_t + \\frac{1}{2} H_t \\right)$$\nThe proportion of hemimethylated dyads at $t+1$ is:\n$$H_{t+1} = (1-p) H' = (1-p) \\left( M_t + \\frac{1}{2} H_t \\right)$$\nThe proportion of unmethylated dyads at $t+1$ is:\n$$U_{t+1} = U' = \\frac{1}{2} H_t + U_t$$\nThe expression for $H_{t+1}$ fulfills the first task of the problem, showing how the abundance of hemimethylated dyads changes over one S phase.\n\nNow, we proceed to the second task: to derive and solve the recurrence for the methylation level $L_t$, defined as $L_t = M_t + \\frac{1}{2} H_t$. This quantity represents the expected fraction of methylated cytosines per dyad. We construct the expression for $L_{t+1}$:\n$$L_{t+1} = M_{t+1} + \\frac{1}{2} H_{t+1}$$\nSubstitute the recurrence relations derived above:\n$$L_{t+1} = p \\left( M_t + \\frac{1}{2} H_t \\right) + \\frac{1}{2} (1-p) \\left( M_t + \\frac{1}{2} H_t \\right)$$\nThe term $( M_t + \\frac{1}{2} H_t )$ is, by definition, $L_t$. We can factor it out:\n$$L_{t+1} = \\left[ p + \\frac{1}{2} (1-p) \\right] \\left( M_t + \\frac{1}{2} H_t \\right)$$\n$$L_{t+1} = \\left( p + \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{p}{2} \\right) L_t$$\n$$L_{t+1} = \\left( \\frac{1+p}{2} \\right) L_t$$\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous recurrence relation. Its solution is a geometric progression of the form $L_t = L_0 \\left( \\frac{1+p}{2} \\right)^t$.\n\nTo find the constant $L_0$, we use the given initial condition: at $t=0$, the dyad is fully methylated. This means $M_0 = 1$, $H_0 = 0$, and $U_0 = 0$.\nThe initial methylation level is therefore:\n$$L_0 = M_0 + \\frac{1}{2} H_0 = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 1$$\nSubstituting $L_0 = 1$ into the general solution gives the final closed-form expression for the methylation level after $t$ divisions:\n$$L_t = \\left( \\frac{1+p}{2} \\right)^t$$\nThis expression describes the exponential decay of the methylation level over successive cell generations, driven by imperfect maintenance methylation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left( \\frac{1+p}{2} \\right)^{t}}\n$$", "id": "2943478"}, {"introduction": "Genomic imprinting often relies on intricate regulatory elements that act as molecular switches, translating a parent-of-origin-specific methylation mark into a functional outcome.

This insulator prevents the enhancer from contacting the *IGF2* promoter and favors activation of *H19*.\n- **Canonical Paternal Allele Function:** The ICR is methylated, CTCF cannot bind, the insulator is absent. The enhancer contacts the *IGF2* promoter, activating it, while *H19* is repressed.\n- **Perturbation:** A heterozygous single-nucleotide variant (SNV) is present only on the maternal allele. This SNV is located at the ICR and disrupts the CTCF consensus sequence, thereby abolishing CTCF binding.\n- **Constraint:** The allele-specific DNA methylation state is unchanged on both alleles (maternal ICR remains unmethylated, paternal ICR remains methylated).\n- **Fundamental Principles for Analysis:**\n    - (i) Imprinting establishes parent-of-origin-specific DNA methylation at the ICR.\n    - (ii) CTCF binding to an unmethylated ICR creates an insulator that partitions chromatin and blocks enhancer-promoter communication.\n    - (iii) Enhancer-promoter contact probability is a primary determinant of gene transcription.\n- **Question:** Predict the allele-specific consequences for chromatin looping, enhancer contacts, and gene expression, and select the best integrative outcome.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem describes the canonical *IGF2*/*H19* imprinting locus, a cornerstone example in molecular biology. The components (ICR, CTCF, enhancer), their states (methylation), and their functions (insulation, activation) are all presented in accordance with established scientific principles. The proposed perturbation—a mutation in a CTCF binding site—is a standard and realistic genetic scenario used to probe gene function. The problem is self-contained, with clear initial conditions, a precise perturbation, and a well-defined question. It does not violate any scientific laws, is not based on speculation, and is objectively phrased. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived based on the provided principles.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe problem requires an analysis of the consequences of a specific genetic mutation in a defined regulatory system. The analysis will proceed by considering each parental allele separately, based on the provided givens and fundamental principles.\n\n**Analysis of the Paternal Allele:**\n- The initial state of the paternal allele is: methylated ICR, no CTCF binding, inactive insulator, enhancer contacts *IGF2* promoter, leading to active *IGF2* expression and repressed *H19*.\n- The problem states the SNV is \"present only on the maternal allele\".\n- Therefore, the paternal allele's DNA sequence, methylation state, protein binding potential (CTCF was already unable to bind due to methylation), chromatin architecture, and gene expression pattern are entirely unaffected.\n- **Conclusion for Paternal Allele:** No change. *IGF2* remains expressed, and *H19* remains repressed.\n\n**Analysis of the Maternal Allele:**\n- The initial state of the maternal allele is: unmethylated ICR, CTCF is bound, insulator is active, enhancer is blocked from accessing *IGF2* and instead activates *H19*. This results in repressed *IGF2* and active *H19*.\n- The perturbation is an SNV on this maternal allele that \"abolishes CTCF binding\" at the ICR. The methylation state remains unmethylated.\n- The direct consequence is the loss of CTCF protein occupancy at the maternal ICR.\n- According to principle (ii), the insulator function is dependent on CTCF occupancy. With CTCF binding abolished, the insulator at the maternal ICR is no longer functional. The chromatin boundary it maintained is lost.\n- The physical barrier separating the shared enhancer from the *IGF2* promoter is now removed.\n- According to principle (iii), enhancer-promoter contact determines expression. The enhancer is now free to loop and physically contact the maternal *IGF2* promoter, similar to the configuration on the paternal allele. This will lead to the transcriptional activation of the maternal *IGF2* gene.\n- The enhancer is described as \"shared\". By engaging with the *IGF2* promoter, it is no longer available to, or is in competition with, the *H19* promoter. Therefore, enhancer contacts with the maternal *H19* promoter will decrease significantly.\n- Consequently, transcription of the maternal *H19* gene will decrease or be abolished.\n- **Conclusion for Maternal Allele:** The allele's behavior switches from maternal-like to paternal-like regarding this locus. *IGF2* expression is gained, and *H19* expression is lost. This constitutes a \"loss of imprinting\" for both genes on this allele.\n\n**Net Integrative Outcome:**\n- ***IGF2* expression:** Active on the paternal allele (unchanged) and becomes active on the maternal allele (new). The result is biallelic expression of *IGF2*.\n- ***H19* expression:** Repressed on the paternal allele (unchanged) and becomes repressed on the maternal allele (new). The result is the loss of *H19* expression from its only active source.\n- **Chromatin:** The enhancer now contacts the *IGF2* promoter on both alleles.\n\nThis derived outcome will now be used to evaluate the provided options.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Maternal allele: loss of CTCF occupancy at the unmethylated ICR abolishes the maternal insulator and its associated loop anchor, allowing the shared enhancer to form new contacts with the maternal IGF2 promoter and reducing contacts with maternal H19; maternal IGF2 increases and maternal H19 decreases. Paternal allele: no change because the ICR is already methylated and lacks CTCF; paternal IGF2 remains active and H19 repressed. Net outcome: enhancer contacts converge on IGF2 on both alleles with biallelic IGF2 expression and loss of H19 expression.**\nThis option precisely matches the step-by-step derivation. It correctly identifies the loss of the insulator on the maternal allele, the resulting rewiring of enhancer contacts from *H19* to *IGF2*, and the consequent switch in expression (maternal *IGF2* ON, maternal *H19* OFF). It correctly states that the paternal allele is unaffected. The net outcome of biallelic *IGF2* expression and loss of *H19* expression is the logical conclusion.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Both alleles: loss of CTCF function collapses domain boundaries globally, redirecting the shared enhancer to H19 on both alleles; IGF2 becomes silenced on both alleles while H19 becomes activated on both alleles, despite unchanged ICR methylation.**\nThis option is incorrect. The mutation is a cis-acting sequence change on the maternal allele only; it cannot affect CTCF function on the homologous paternal chromosome (\"trans-effect\"). Furthermore, it incorrectly predicts that loss of the insulator redirects the enhancer to *H19*. The problem states the insulator's function is to *favor* *H19* by blocking *IGF2*; removing the insulator should do the opposite.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Maternal allele: no change in looping or expression because DNA methylation at the ICR is unaltered; paternal allele: increased CTCF occupancy strengthens the insulator in trans, enabling paternal H19 activation with persistent paternal IGF2 expression. Net outcome: paternal H19 and IGF2 both increase due to enhanced insulation.**\nThis option is incorrect. Its premise that \"no change\" occurs on the maternal allele because methylation is unaltered is fundamentally flawed. Gene regulation at this locus depends on the presence of the bound CTCF protein, not solely on the methylation mark. The mutation directly abolishes protein binding, which must cause a change. The proposed \"trans\" effect on the paternal allele is biologically unfounded for this type of insulator and contradicts the fact that CTCF cannot bind the methylated paternal ICR.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Maternal allele: loss of CTCF-mediated insulation at the unmethylated ICR increases long-range loop extrusion past the enhancer, reducing enhancer residence time near both promoters, thereby decreasing IGF2 on both alleles by a trans-acting promoter competition effect, while increasing H19 on the maternal allele due to reduced competition. Paternal allele: unaffected looping and methylation but reduced IGF2 due to diminished enhancer performance in trans.**\nThis option is incorrect. It invokes complex and speculative mechanisms (\"long-range loop extrusion,\" \"trans-acting promoter competition\") not supported by the simple, fundamental principles provided in the problem statement. Its prediction that maternal *H19* increases contradicts the known function of the insulator. The proposed trans-acting reduction of *IGF2* expression from the paternal allele is not a direct or necessary consequence of the cis-acting mutation on the maternal allele.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2943511"}, {"introduction": "Understanding imprinting is critical for diagnosing developmental disorders, but pinpointing the underlying molecular lesion can be complex.

The observed genotype A/A is a Mendelian inconsistency, explainable only by a genotyping error.\n$P(G_{C,3}^{obs}=A/A \\mid P_3, \\mathrm{H}_2) = P(G_{C,3}^{obs}=A/A \\mid G_{C,3}^{true}=A/G) = \\frac{e_g}{2} = \\frac{0.01}{2} = 0.005$.\n\nSNP 4: Father T/T, Mother C/T, Child T/T.\nUnder $\\mathrm{H}_1$: The father is homozygous T/T, so the true child genotype must be T/T.\n$P(G_{C,4}^{obs}=T/T \\mid P_4, \\mathrm{H}_1) = P(G_{C,4}^{obs}=T/T \\mid G_{C,4}^{true}=T/T) = 1-e_g = 0.99$.\nUnder $\\mathrm{H}_2$: The parents are T/T and C/T, so the true child genotype is C/T with probability $0.5$ or T/T with probability $0.5$.\n$P(G_{C,4}^{obs}=T/T \\mid P_4, \\mathrm{H}_2) = P(G_{C,4}^{obs}=T/T \\mid G_{C,4}^{true}=C/T) \\cdot P(G_{C,4}^{true}=C/T) + P(G_{C,4}^{obs}=T/T \\mid G_{C,4}^{true}=T/T) \\cdot P(G_{C,4}^{true}=T/T) = (\\frac{e_g}{2})(0.5) + (1-e_g)(0.5) = 0.5(1 - \\frac{e_g}{2}) = 0.4975$.\n\nNow, we combine these results to find the total likelihood for the genotype data $\\mathcal{G}$ under each hypothesis.\nFor $\\mathrm{H}_1$:\n$P(\\mathcal{G} \\mid \\mathrm{H}_1) = P(\\mathcal{G}_1 \\mid \\mathrm{H}_1) \\times P(\\mathcal{G}_2 \\mid \\mathrm{H}_1) \\times P(\\mathcal{G}_3 \\mid \\mathrm{H}_1) \\times P(\\mathcal{G}_4 \\mid \\mathrm{H}_1)$\n$P(\\mathcal{G} \\mid \\mathrm{H}_1) = (0.4975) \\times (0.4975) \\times (0.99) \\times (0.99) = (0.4975)^2 \\times (0.99)^2 \\approx 0.24258$.\nFor $\\mathrm{H}_2$:\n$P(\\mathcal{G} \\mid \\mathrm{H}_2) = P(\\mathcal{G}_1 \\mid \\mathrm{H}_2) \\times P(\\mathcal{G}_2 \\mid \\mathrm{H}_2) \\times P(\\mathcal{G}_3 \\mid \\mathrm{H}_2) \\times P(\\mathcal{G}_4 \\mid \\mathrm{H}_2)$\n$P(\\mathcal{G} \\mid \\mathrm{H}_2) = (0.4975) \\times (0.4975) \\times (0.005) \\times (0.4975) = (0.4975)^3 \\times (0.005) \\approx 0.00061570$.\n\nNext, we incorporate the methylation data likelihoods to find the total likelihood for data $\\mathcal{D}$.\nFor $\\mathrm{H}_1$:\n$P(\\mathcal{D} \\mid \\mathrm{H}_1) = P(\\mathcal{M} \\mid \\mathrm{H}_1) \\times P(\\mathcal{G} \\mid \\mathrm{H}_1) = 0.97 \\times ((0.4975)^2 \\times (0.99)^2) \\approx 0.97 \\times 0.24258 \\approx 0.23530$.\nFor $\\mathrm{H}_2$:\n$P(\\mathcal{D} \\mid \\mathrm{H}_2) = P(\\mathcal{M} \\mid \\mathrm{H}_2) \\times P(\\mathcal{G} \\mid \\mathrm{H}_2) = 0.65 \\times ((0.4975)^3 \\times 0.005) \\approx 0.65 \\times 0.00061570 \\approx 0.00040021$.\n\nUsing the full precision values for computation:\n$P(\\mathcal{G} \\mid \\mathrm{H}_1) = (0.4975)^2 \\times (0.99)^2 = 0.24750625 \\times 0.9801 = 0.242580875625$.\n$P(\\mathcal{D} \\mid \\mathrm{H}_1) = 0.97 \\times 0.242580875625 = 0.23530344935625$.\n$P(\\mathcal{G} \\mid \\mathrm{H}_2) = (0.4975)^3 \\times 0.005 = 0.123140609375 \\times 0.005 = 0.000615703046875$.\n$P(\\mathcal{D} \\mid \\mathrm{H}_2) = 0.65 \\times 0.000615703046875 = 0.00040020698046875$.\n\nFinally, we apply Bayes' theorem with the given priors $P(\\mathrm{H}_1)=0.20$ and $P(\\mathrm{H}_2)=0.80$.\nThe numerator term for $\\mathrm{H}_1$ is:\n$P(\\mathcal{D} \\mid \\mathrm{H}_1) P(\\mathrm{H}_1) = 0.23530344935625 \\times 0.20 = 0.04706068987125$.\nThe numerator term for $\\mathrm{H}_2$ is:\n$P(\\mathcal{D} \\mid \\mathrm{H}_2) P(\\mathrm{H}_2) = 0.00040020698046875 \\times 0.80 = 0.000320165584375$.\nThe denominator, which is the marginal probability of the data $P(\\mathcal{D})$, is the sum of these two terms:\n$P(\\mathcal{D}) = 0.04706068987125 + 0.000320165584375 = 0.047380855455625$.\n\nThe posterior probability of $\\mathrm{H}_1$ is the ratio:\n$$\nP(\\mathrm{H}_1 \\mid \\mathcal{D}) = \\frac{0.04706068987125}{0.047380855455625} \\approx 0.99324685\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.9932$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9932}$$", "id": "2943490"}]}
