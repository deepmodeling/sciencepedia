Several observations suggest that L may regulate G in cis. Specifically, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi) using deactivated CRISPR associated protein 9 (dCas9)-Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) targeted to the transcription start site (TSS) of L reduces both L transcription and G messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance. Deletion of the core L promoter similarly decreases G expression. However, the following general facts complicate interpretation: (i) transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) can alter local chromatin and three-dimensional contacts independent of any particular RNA sequence; (ii) passage of Pol II can deposit histone marks such as histone 3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) along gene bodies and can displace or facilitate loading of transcription factors; (iii) promoter elements can act as enhancers for nearby genes independent of any transcript; and (iv) transcription through, or across, regulatory DNA can cause transcriptional interference.\n\nFrom first principles rooted in the Central Dogma and the above well-tested observations, transcription-dependent but RNA-independent effects can masquerade as cis lncRNA function because Pol II initiation and elongation can modify chromatin accessibility, nucleosome positioning, histone modification landscapes, and enhancer-promoter communication without requiring a specific lncRNA sequence or structure.\n\nYou are tasked with designing a decisive experiment to disentangle the requirement for Pol II passage across the L locus from any requirement for the L RNA product itself in regulating G, while controlling for effects of the L promoter DNA as a cis-regulatory element.\n\nWhich option(s) below most directly accomplish this, with appropriate internal controls, and allow rigorous interpretation of transcription-dependent versus RNA-dependent mechanisms?

It describes a central and unresolved question in the study of non-coding RNA function. All mentioned biological entities (lncRNAs, Pol II, CRISPRi) and mechanisms (transcriptional interference, chromatin modification by transcription) are well-established concepts in molecular and cell biology.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It presents a clear initial state (ambiguous observations) and a precise goal (design an experiment to disambiguate mechanisms). The constraints and confounding factors are clearly articulated, defining the intellectual challenge.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective, technical language, free from subjective or speculative claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formulated question in experimental design within molecular biology. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core difficulty in this problem lies in the fact that transcription is a process that inextricably links a DNA template, the enzymatic machinery (Pol II), and an RNA product. A perturbation that targets one component often affects the others. For example, repressing the L promoter with CRISPRi prevents Pol II from initiating, which simultaneously eliminates the act of transcription across the gene body and prevents the synthesis of the L RNA product. A rigorous experimental design must create specific conditions that can isolate these variables. Specifically, one must devise scenarios to achieve:\n1. Transcription by Pol II across the L locus, but without a stable L RNA product.\n2. Premature termination of transcription, preventing Pol II passage, to be compared with the first scenario.\n3. Absence of transcription, but with the L RNA product supplied *in cis*.\n\nA successful design will pair such experiments to allow for a logical deduction of the critical regulatory component. We will now evaluate each option against these criteria.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. Engineer two complementary perturbations at L: insert tandem strong polyadenylation (pA) cassettes immediately downstream of the L TSS to enforce early termination and block elongation, and in a separate allele insert tandem self-cleaving ribozymes into the nascent L transcript so that the RNA is destroyed co-transcriptionally while Pol II elongation proceeds. Compare effects on G. A phenocopy by early pA but not by ribozyme cleavage indicates a requirement for polymerase passage but not the RNA product; the converse indicates RNA product dependence.\n\nThis option presents a pair of elegant, complementary perturbations. The first, insertion of a pA cassette, ablates both the full-length RNA product and the passage of Pol II across the gene body. This serves as a strong loss-of-function allele for any downstream effect. The second, co-transcriptional degradation of the L RNA via ribozymes, theoretically preserves the act of transcription by Pol II while ablating the RNA product. Comparing the effect on G gene expression between these two alleles allows one to distinguish the two possibilities. If the ribozyme-containing allele restores G expression to normal levels while the pA-containing allele does not, it strongly implies that the act of transcription, not the stable RNA product, is the regulatory mechanism. Conversely, if both perturbations lead to a similar reduction in G expression, it implicates the RNA product as the necessary agent. Both perturbations leave the L promoter intact, controlling for its potential function as a static enhancer. This experimental design is logical, direct, and rigorous.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Express L from an ectopic safe-harbor locus under a strong heterologous promoter while continuing to repress the endogenous L promoter with CRISPRi. If G expression is not rescued, conclude that L does not act via its RNA product.\n\nThis experiment tests whether the L RNA can function in *trans*. The problem statement, however, is premised on observations suggesting a *cis* regulatory mechanism. While failure to rescue in *trans* is consistent with a *cis*-only mechanism, it does nothing to dissect the nature of that *cis* mechanism. It does not separate the act of transcription from the function of the RNA product at the endogenous locus. Therefore, this experiment does not address the question posed.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Delete the L exons while leaving the L promoter and TSS intact to eliminate the mature L RNA without affecting initiation, and interpret any reduction in G as evidence for RNA product dependence.\n\nThis approach is crude and fraught with potential artifacts. Deleting exons is a significant genomic alteration that could inadvertently remove embedded regulatory DNA elements (e.g., enhancers residing in introns or exons) that are independent of the RNA product. Furthermore, transcription of a gene lacking exons and canonical termination signals is likely to be aberrant, possibly leading to unstable polymerase elongation or premature termination. This makes it impossible to cleanly conclude that an observed effect is due solely to the absence of the mature RNA product. The interpretation is not rigorous because it fails to exclude alternative explanations related to disrupted transcription dynamics or the deletion of DNA elements.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Delete the endogenous L promoter and reintroduce the full-length L complementary DNA (cDNA) under a heterologous promoter at a distal genomic site. If G expression is restored, conclude that the L RNA product is sufficient for the *cis* effect.\n\nThis experimental design is logically fallacious. It tests for rescue in *trans* (from a distal site). If expression of G is restored, the only valid conclusion is that the L RNA can function in *trans*. This says nothing about its native *cis* mechanism. To then conclude it is sufficient for a *cis* effect is a non-sequitur. This experiment fails to investigate the *cis* locus as required by the problem.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. Install deactivated CRISPR associated protein 9 (dCas9) roadblocks targeted within the L gene body downstream of the TSS to stall Pol II at defined positions without altering promoter DNA, thereby preventing polymerase passage across a candidate regulatory DNA segment; in a complementary perturbation, block L transcription initiation with CRISPRi while locally tethering the mature L RNA to the L locus using MS2 bacteriophage hairpins engineered into the RNA and MS2 coat protein (MCP)-fused dCas9 targeted to the L locus. Concordant effects across these paired perturbations separate polymerase passage requirements from RNA product requirements in *cis*.\n\nThis option describes a state-of-the-art and highly rigorous approach. The first part uses dCas9 as a programmable roadblock to stall Pol II, testing the necessity of transcription elongation past a specific point. Crucially, this does not alter the underlying DNA sequence, thus avoiding confounders from deleting cryptic DNA elements. The second part is a direct test of sufficiency: it ablates endogenous transcription but provides the RNA product exogenously, tethered to its site of action. This is the canonical test for RNA sufficiency in *cis*. The pairing of a \"loss-of-function\" experiment for transcription elongation (the roadblock) with a \"gain-of-function\" experiment for the RNA product (the tethering) provides the most complete mechanistic dissection. If the roadblock reduces G expression but tethering the RNA fails to rescue it, the act of transcription is implicated. If the roadblock has no effect but tethering the RNA is sufficient to activate/repress G (in an appropriate background), the RNA product is implicated. This design is exceptionally well-controlled and directly addresses the central question.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "2962752"}]}
