Engineer single cysteine pairs at the Mcm2–Mcm5 interface to allow a disulfide “lock,” and, in separate MCM2–7 preparations, at two other interfaces (for example, Mcm4–Mcm6 and Mcm6–Mcm2) that are not proposed to be gates.

The proteins, their functions, the concept of origin licensing, and helicase loading are all central to this field. The experimental techniques described—reconstituted biochemical systems, disulfide trapping, high-salt wash assays, and photocrosslinking—are standard and rigorous methods used in contemporary research.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The objective is clear and specific: to devise an experiment to test for the *exclusivity* of a proposed molecular gate. The provided facts and tools are sufficient to construct and evaluate such an experiment.\n- **Objectivity:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\nStep 3: Verdict.\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains no apparent flaws. It describes a realistic and non-trivial challenge in experimental design. The problem is **valid**. We may proceed to the solution.\n\n**Solution Derivation and Option Analysis**\n\nThe core of the problem is to establish *exclusivity*. This requires a multifaceted experimental design that not only demonstrates that the Mcm2–Mcm5 interface is necessary for loading but also that other interfaces are not sufficient. A rigorous design must include:\n1.  A specific perturbation to block the function of the proposed Mcm2–Mcm5 gate.\n2.  Negative controls where other potential gates are blocked to test for alternative pathways.\n3.  A direct and unambiguous assay for the outcome, which is topological loading.\n4.  A control for the reversibility of the perturbation, to ensure that the protein has not been irreversibly damaged.\n5.  Independent, corroborating evidence for the proposed mechanism.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option against these criteria.\n\n**Option A:**\nThis option proposes a comprehensive experimental plan.\n1.  **Perturbation:** It uses a disulfide lock, a specific and reversible method, to close the Mcm2–Mcm5 interface.\n2.  **Negative Controls:** Crucially, it includes preparations where other interfaces (Mcm4–Mcm6 and Mcm6–Mcm2) are locked. This is essential for testing exclusivity. If loading proceeds when these other interfaces are locked, it supports the idea that they are not gates.\n3.  **Assay:** It employs the correct assay for topological loading: retention on a covalently closed circle after a $0.50\\,\\mathrm{M}$ NaCl wash.\n4.  **Reversibility:** It includes a rescue experiment using $1.0\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ DTT to reduce the disulfide and restore function, demonstrating that the loss of activity was due specifically to the interface lock and not to general protein misfolding or damage.\n5.  **Corroborating Evidence:** It proposes a parallel photocrosslinking experiment. The prediction that DNA transiently contacts the Mcm2–Mcm5 interface during loading, and that this contact is abolished when the gate is locked, provides direct physical evidence that DNA passes through this specific location.\n\nThe combination of these elements forms a powerful and logical argument. If the predicted outcomes are observed, it would strongly support the conclusion that the Mcm2–Mcm5 interface is the exclusive DNA entry gate. This design is robust, well-controlled, and directly addresses the question.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B:**\nThis option proposes to introduce disulfide locks at the Walker A motifs of MCM2–7 subunits. The Walker A motif is the P-loop, an essential component of the ATP-binding pocket in ATPases. Locking this motif would inhibit ATP binding or hydrolysis. The problem states that loading requires ATP. Therefore, inactivating the ATPase motor will inhibit loading regardless of which interface serves as the gate. This experiment tests the requirement for ATPase activity, not the identity of the DNA entry gate. It confounds two distinct functions (gate opening and ATP-driven conformational changes) and cannot provide specific information about the gate's location.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C:**\nThis option proposes to test loading of a locked Mcm2–Mcm5 complex on *linearized* origin DNA. A linear DNA molecule has two free ends. A ring-shaped protein like MCM2–7 can slide onto linear DNA from a free end without the need to open any gate. This process, known as end-loading, is topologically and mechanistically distinct from the loading process at an origin on a covalently closed circle. Therefore, observing salt-resistant binding in this experiment would be expected and would provide no information about the mechanism of gate opening during origin licensing on the physiologically relevant substrate, a closed circle. The experiment does not test the hypothesis in the relevant context.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D:**\nThis option proposes to covalently crosslink DNA to the Mcm3–Mcm7 interface and see if it inhibits loading. While this is a valid proximity experiment, a positive result (inhibition of loading) is ambiguous. The covalent tether could sterically hinder subsequent conformational changes required for loading, even if the Mcm3–Mcm7 interface is not a gate. The DNA must be encircled by the entire ring, so it will necessarily be in proximity to all six interfaces at some point. This experiment can show that tethering DNA at this position is inhibitory, but it cannot prove that the Mcm3–Mcm7 interface functions as an entry gate. Furthermore, this experiment does not test the necessity of the Mcm2–Mcm5 gate, which is central to the question.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A describes the most rigorous and complete experimental design. It directly tests the necessity of the Mcm2–Mcm5 interface, includes critical negative controls to establish exclusivity, incorporates a reversibility control to rule out artifacts, and proposes an independent method to provide corroborating mechanistic evidence. The other options are flawed because they either test the wrong activity (Option B), use an irrelevant substrate (Option C), or employ a method that yields ambiguous results (Option D).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2944573"}, {"introduction": "Loading the MCM helicase is a critical first step, but ensuring it happens only once per cell cycle is paramount for genomic stability.

Your task is to act as a molecular detective, reasoning from a specific molecular defect through the resulting DNA structures to predict the precise signatures of the activated DNA damage response pathways, integrating knowledge of cell cycle control and checkpoint signaling.", "problem": "A human cell line is engineered to express a mutant Cell Division Cycle 10 dependent transcript 1 (Cdt1) in which the Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA)-interacting protein (PIP) box is weakened such that Cullin 4 RING E3 ligase complex bound to Damage-specific DNA binding protein 1 (CRL4–Cdt2)–mediated, S-phase PCNA-coupled proteolysis is reduced by approximately $50\\%$. Geminin levels and Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activities remain normal. Consider the following foundational facts: (i) in eukaryotes, replication licensing is restricted to late mitosis and G1 by loading the Minichromosome Maintenance proteins 2–7 (MCM2–7) helicase via Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), Cell Division Cycle 6 (Cdc6), and Cdt1; (ii) S-phase CDK activity and geminin normally suppress new licensing, and Cdt1 is rapidly degraded in S-phase to prevent relicensing; (iii) relicensing within S-phase can cause origin refiring, replication fork collisions, extensive single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and, upon collapse, some double-strand breaks (DSBs); (iv) Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase is activated by Replication Protein A (RPA)-coated ssDNA and signals to Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), whereas Ataxia Telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase responds to DSBs and signals to Checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2).\n\nAssume that at S-phase onset the genome contains approximately $N_e = 2\\times 10^3$ early-firing origins. Due to the partial failure of Cdt1 degradation, a fraction $f = 0.1$ of these early origins become relicensed and each refires once within S-phase. Each refiring event generates, on average, $s = 5\\times 10^3$ nucleotides of ssDNA prior to resolution by fork convergence or reversal, and the probability that a stalled fork collapses to a DSB is $q = 0.05$.\n\nBased on these inputs and the established mechanisms above, which of the following composite experimental signatures best matches the expected outcome in this mutant?\n\nA. Predominant ATR–Chk1 pathway activation with numerous RPA foci and robust phosphorylation of RPA32 (Ser33), ATR (Thr1989), and Chk1 (Ser345); discrete $\\gamma$-H2AX and p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) foci numbering on the order of $\\sim 10$ per nucleus; DNA fiber labeling shows green–red–green tracts consistent with relicensing and refiring near early origins; shallow, focal copy-number gains concentrated in early-replicating euchromatin; S-phase prolongation with a G2/M delay.\n\nB. Predominant ATM–Chk2 pathway activation with pan-nuclear $\\gamma$-H2AX, minimal RPA or Chk1 phosphorylation; normal S-phase duration; widespread copy-number losses focused in late-replicating heterochromatin; immediate G1 arrest without S/G2 slowing.\n\nC. No detectable checkpoint activation because CDK activity suffices to block relicensing; normal replication dynamics and DNA content; no change in copy number; Cdt1 chromatin levels remain minimal throughout S-phase.\n\nD. Activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (e.g., BubR1, Mad2) with mitotic arrest and abundant anaphase bridges and micronuclei but absent S-phase RPA or $\\gamma$-H2AX foci; no evidence of origin refiring on DNA fibers and no early-euchromatin copy-number gains.", "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and well-posed, providing a realistic experimental scenario based on established principles of eukaryotic DNA replication and checkpoint control.\n\nThe central thesis of the problem is the consequence of partial stabilization of Cell Division Cycle 10 dependent transcript 1 (Cdt1) during a eukaryotic S-phase. The mutant Cdt1 exhibits reduced degradation, with proteolysis decreased by approximately $50\\%$. Although geminin levels and Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activities are normal, this surfeit of Cdt1 is sufficient to cause relicensing and subsequent refiring of a fraction of replication origins. The problem provides quantitative parameters to assess the scale of the resulting DNA damage and predict the cellular response.\n\nFirst, we must quantify the primary molecular insults.\nThe number of early-firing origins is given as $N_e = 2\\times 10^3$.\nThe fraction of these origins that relicense and refire is $f = 0.1$.\nTherefore, the number of unscheduled re-replication events per nucleus in S-phase is:\n$$N_{refire} = f \\times N_e = 0.1 \\times (2\\times 10^3) = 200$$\n\nEach refiring event is stated to generate, on average, $s = 5\\times 10^3$ nucleotides of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). This ssDNA is the primary signal for the Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase pathway. The total amount of ssDNA generated per nucleus is:\n$$S_{total} = N_{refire} \\times s = 200 \\times (5\\times 10^3 \\text{ nt}) = 10^6 \\text{ nt}$$\nThis is a substantial quantity of ssDNA (1 megabase), which will be coated by Replication Protein A (RPA), leading to the formation of numerous RPA foci and potent activation of the ATR–Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) signaling cascade.\n\nNext, we calculate the expected number of double-strand breaks (DSBs). DSBs are the primary signal for the Ataxia Telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase pathway. The problem states that the probability of a stalled fork, resulting from a re-replication event, collapsing into a DSB is $q = 0.05$. Assuming each refiring event presents a risk of such a collapse, the expected number of DSBs per nucleus is:\n$$N_{DSB} = N_{refire} \\times q = 200 \\times 0.05 = 10$$\nThis is a small number of DSBs. It will lead to the activation of the ATM–Checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) pathway, but the signal will be localized to these few sites and will be far less extensive than the signal emanating from the widespread ssDNA.\n\nFrom these calculations, we can predict the nature of the checkpoint response. The ssDNA-induced signal ($10^6$ nt of ssDNA at 200 sites) will grossly outweigh the DSB-induced signal (10 breaks). Therefore, the ATR–Chk1 pathway will be the **predominant** activated checkpoint. This entails robust phosphorylation of ATR (e.g., at Threonine 1989), its substrate Chk1 (e.g., at Serine 345), and RPA itself (e.g., RPA32 at Serine 33). The ATM-dependent response will be limited, generating a small number of discrete foci for DSB markers like phosphorylated histone H2AX ($\\gamma$-H2AX) and p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1), on the order of 10 per nucleus.\n\nWe can also predict the downstream cellular and genomic consequences:\n1.  **Cell Cycle Progression**: Strong ATR–Chk1 activation is known to slow DNA replication fork progression and inhibit the firing of late origins, causing S-phase prolongation. It also enforces a G2/M checkpoint by inhibiting Cdc25 phosphatases, leading to a G2/M delay or arrest.\n2.  **Genomic Structure**: The re-replication events themselves have direct structural consequences. In DNA fiber assays using sequential nucleotide analogue labeling (e.g., green, then red), refiring from an origin results in a characteristic green–red–green tract. Since re-replication is stated to occur at early-firing origins, which are predominantly in euchromatin, this will lead to localized amplification of these genomic regions. This presents as shallow, focal copy-number gains in early-replicating parts of the genome when analyzed by techniques like array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) or sequencing.\n\nNow, we evaluate the provided options based on this comprehensive prediction.\n\n**A. Predominant ATR–Chk1 pathway activation with numerous RPA foci and robust phosphorylation of RPA32 (Ser33), ATR (Thr1989), and Chk1 (Ser345); discrete $\\gamma$-H2AX and p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) foci numbering on the order of $\\sim 10$ per nucleus; DNA fiber labeling shows green–red–green tracts consistent with relicensing and refiring near early origins; shallow, focal copy-number gains concentrated in early-replicating euchromatin; S-phase prolongation with a G2/M delay.**\nThis option aligns perfectly with every aspect of our derivation. It correctly identifies ATR–Chk1 as the predominant pathway, accurately quantifies the DSB response (on the order of 10 foci), and correctly describes all the key experimental signatures: the re-replication patterns on DNA fibers, the location and nature of copy-number changes, and the cell cycle checkpoint effects.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Predominant ATM–Chk2 pathway activation with pan-nuclear $\\gamma$-H2AX, minimal RPA or Chk1 phosphorylation; normal S-phase duration; widespread copy-number losses focused in late-replicating heterochromatin; immediate G1 arrest without S/G2 slowing.**\nThis option is incorrect on multiple grounds. The ATR pathway, not ATM, will be predominant. We expect robust RPA and Chk1 phosphorylation, not minimal. We expect discrete $\\gamma$-H2AX foci (~10), not pan-nuclear staining which implies catastrophic, widespread DSBs. S-phase will be prolonged, not normal. Copy-number changes will be gains, not losses, and located in early, not late, replicating regions. The checkpoint will manifest in S and G2, not as a G1 arrest.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. No detectable checkpoint activation because CDK activity suffices to block relicensing; normal replication dynamics and DNA content; no change in copy number; Cdt1 chromatin levels remain minimal throughout S-phase.**\nThis option proposes no phenotype. It is contradicted by the problem's premise that relicensing and refiring *do* occur for a fraction $f=0.1$ of origins. This finite amount of re-replication necessarily causes DNA damage and checkpoint activation. The premise of partial failure in Cdt1 degradation means its levels will be elevated, not minimal.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (e.g., BubR1, Mad2) with mitotic arrest and abundant anaphase bridges and micronuclei but absent S-phase RPA or $\\gamma$-H2AX foci; no evidence of origin refiring on DNA fibers and no early-euchromatin copy-number gains.**\nThis option misidentifies the primary checkpoint. The spindle assembly checkpoint monitors mitotic events, not S-phase DNA damage. The immediate response is from the DNA damage checkpoint (ATR/ATM). Furthermore, it incorrectly claims the absence of S-phase damage foci (RPA, $\\gamma$-H2AX) and re-replication evidence (DNA fibers, copy-number gains), which directly contradicts the consequences of the given scenario. While unresolved replication stress can lead to mitotic errors like anaphase bridges, this is a downstream consequence, and asserting the absence of the initial S-phase damage signals is fundamentally wrong.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nIn summary, the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the problem's premises leads to a unique set of expected experimental outcomes, which are described precisely and comprehensively by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2944563"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the mechanism and regulation of a single origin, we now zoom out to the entire genome.

Derivation of the Occupancy Model**\n\nWe model the system using the grand canonical ensemble, where a set of $N$ independent DNA binding sites are in equilibrium with a pool of ORC molecules characterized by a chemical potential $\\mu$.\n\nFor a single site $i$, we must account for its chromatin accessibility, $a_i$. This parameter represents the probability that the site is physically available for binding. The site is inaccessible with probability $(1-a_i)$, in which case no binding can occur.\n\nThe expected fractional occupancy $p_i$ of site $i$ is the probability that it is bound by an ORC molecule. This can be expressed as an expectation over the accessibility states:\n$$p_i = \\mathbb{P}(\\text{bound} | \\text{accessible}) \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(\\text{accessible}) + \\mathbb{P}(\\text{bound} | \\text{inaccessible}) \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(\\text{inaccessible})$$\nGiven the problem definition, we have $\\mathbb{P}(\\text{accessible}) = a_i$, $\\mathbb{P}(\\text{inaccessible}) = 1-a_i$, and $\\mathbb{P}(\\text{bound} | \\text{inaccessible}) = 0$. Thus, the expression simplifies to:\n$$p_i = a_i \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(\\text{bound} | \\text{accessible})$$\n\nThe conditional probability of binding, given that the site is accessible, is determined by the grand partition function for an accessible site. An accessible site has two microstates: unbound and bound.\n1.  **Unbound state:** Number of bound particles $N_{part}=0$. We define this state as the reference energy, $E_{unbound}=0$. Its statistical weight is $e^{-\\beta(E_{unbound} - \\mu N_{part})} = e^{-\\beta(0 - \\mu \\cdot 0)} = 1$.\n2.  **Bound state:** Number of bound particles $N_{part}=1$. The binding free energy is $E_i$. Its statistical weight is $e^{-\\beta(E_i - \\mu N_{part})} = e^{-\\beta(E_i - \\mu \\cdot 1)} = e^{-\\beta(E_i - \\mu)}$.\n\nThe grand partition function for an accessible site $i$ is the sum of these weights:\n$$\\mathcal{Z}_i^{\\text{acc}} = 1 + e^{-\\beta(E_i - \\mu)}$$\nThe probability of the site being bound, conditional on it being accessible, is the ratio of the bound state's weight to the partition function:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(\\text{bound} | \\text{accessible}) = \\frac{e^{-\\beta(E_i - \\mu)}}{1 + e^{-\\beta(E_i - \\mu)}} = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{\\beta(E_i - \\mu)}}$$\nThis is the familiar form of a Langmuir isotherm or Fermi-Dirac distribution.\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $p_i$, we obtain the final fractional occupancy for site $i$:\n$$p_i = a_i \\frac{1}{1 + e^{\\beta(E_i - \\mu)}}$$\nThe problem specifies that all energies $E_i$ are given in units of $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$, and we must take $\\beta = 1/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T) = 1$. The expression becomes:\n$$p_i(\\mu) = a_i \\frac{1}{1 + e^{E_i - \\mu}}$$\n\n**2. Constraint on Chemical Potential $\\mu$**\n\nThe total expected number of bound ORC molecules across all $N$ sites must equal a specified value $M$. This imposes a constraint that determines the value of $\\mu$:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_i(\\mu) = M$$\nSubstituting the expression for $p_i$:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i \\frac{1}{1 + e^{E_i - \\mu}} = M$$\nThis is a scalar equation in a single variable $\\mu$. To solve it, we define a function $h(\\mu)$:\n$$h(\\mu) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i \\frac{1}{1 + e^{E_i - \\mu}} - M = 0$$\n\n**3. Numerical Solution Algorithm**\n\nTo find the value of $\\mu$ that satisfies the constraint for a given set of $\\{E_i\\}$, $\\{a_i\\}$, and $M$, we must find the root of the function $h(\\mu)$. Let's analyze the properties of $h(\\mu)$. Its derivative with respect to $\\mu$ is:\n$$h'(\\mu) = \\frac{d}{d\\mu} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i \\frac{1}{1 + e^{E_i - \\mu}} \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i \\left( - \\frac{1}{(1 + e^{E_i - \\mu})^2} \\right) \\cdot (-e^{E_i - \\mu}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i \\frac{e^{E_i - \\mu}}{(1 + e^{E_i - \\mu})^2}$$\nSince $a_i \\in [0,1]$ and the exponential term is always positive, $h'(\\mu) \\ge 0$. If at least one $a_i > 0$, then $h'(\\mu) > 0$, which means that the function $\\sum p_i(\\mu)$ is strictly monotonically increasing with $\\mu$. This property guarantees that if a solution for $\\mu$ exists, it is unique.\n\nThe range of the function $\\sum p_i(\\mu)$ can be determined by its limits:\n- As $\\mu \\to -\\infty$, $e^{E_i - \\mu} \\to \\infty$, so $p_i(\\mu) \\to 0$. The sum approaches $0$.\n- As $\\mu \\to +\\infty$, $e^{E_i - \\mu} \\to 0$, so $p_i(\\mu) \\to a_i$. The sum approaches $\\sum a_i$.\n\nLet $M_{\\text{max}} = \\sum_{i=1}^N a_i$. This is the maximum possible number of bound molecules, achieved at saturation ($\\mu \\to \\infty$). The numerical algorithm must handle three cases for the input $M$:\n\n1.  **Case $M \\le 0$:** The only physical solution is $M=0$, corresponding to no binding. This occurs at $\\mu \\to -\\infty$. For this case, all occupancies are $p_i = 0$.\n2.  **Case $M \\ge M_{\\text{max}}$:** The system is saturated. This corresponds to the limit $\\mu \\to +\\infty$. For this case, all occupancies are at their maximum possible value, $p_i = a_i$.\n3.  **Case $0 < M < M_{\\text{max}}$:** A unique, finite solution for $\\mu$ exists. Since $h(\\mu)$ is monotonic and continuous, we can employ a robust numerical root-finding algorithm, such as the Brent-Dekker method (as implemented in `scipy.optimize.brentq`). We can safely bracket the root in a wide interval, for example $\\mu \\in [-100, 100]$, as $h(\\mu)$ will change sign from negative (near $-100$) to positive (near $100$).\n\nThe complete algorithm is as follows:\n- For each test case:\n  1. Calculate the binding energy $E_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{L} \\epsilon_{b_{i,j},j}$ for each site $i$.\n  2. Calculate the maximum total occupancy $M_{\\text{max}} = \\sum_i a_i$.\n  3. Apply the boundary condition logic for $M$. If $M \\le 0$ or $M \\ge M_{\\text{max}}$, calculate $p_i$ directly.\n  4. Otherwise, use a numerical root-finder on $h(\\mu)=0$ to find $\\mu$.\n  5. Use the found value of $\\mu$ to calculate the final occupancies $p_i$.\n- Collect and format all results.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import brentq\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Formulates and solves the thermodynamic model for ORC binding to DNA.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Energy parameterization (position-specific energy contributions in k_B T)\n    energy_matrix = {\n        'A': np.array([-1.0, 0.1, 0.2, -0.3, -0.2, -0.1]),\n        'C': np.array([0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2]),\n        'G': np.array([0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2]),\n        'T': np.array([-0.5, -0.4, -0.6, -0.1, -0.2, -0.3])\n    }\n\n    def calculate_energies(sequences, matrix):\n        \"\"\"Calculates binding energies for a list of DNA sequences.\"\"\"\n        energies = []\n        for seq in sequences:\n            energy = sum(matrix[base][pos] for pos, base in enumerate(seq))\n            energies.append(energy)\n        return np.array(energies)\n\n    def solve_for_occupancies(sequences, accessibilities, M):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates equilibrium fractional occupancies for a given test case.\n        \"\"\"\n        a = np.array(accessibilities, dtype=float)\n        E = calculate_energies(sequences, energy_matrix)\n\n        M_max = np.sum(a)\n\n        # Handle boundary case: no molecules to bind.\n        if M <= 0:\n            return np.zeros_like(a)\n\n        # Handle boundary case: if max possible binding is 0, occupancy must be 0.\n        if M_max == 0:\n            return np.zeros_like(a)\n\n        # Handle boundary case: saturating concentration of molecules.\n        if M >= M_max:\n            return a\n\n        # General case: 0 < M < M_max.
