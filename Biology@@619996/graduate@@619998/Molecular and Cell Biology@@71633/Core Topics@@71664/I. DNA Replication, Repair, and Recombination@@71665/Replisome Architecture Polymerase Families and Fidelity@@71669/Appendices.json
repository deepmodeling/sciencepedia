The use of first-order rate constants to model competing reaction pathways (fingers closing/opening, chemistry, polymerase/exonuclease partitioning) is a fundamental approach in enzyme kinetics and biophysics. The provided rate constants are within physically plausible orders of magnitude for such enzymatic processes.

The rate constants associated with this step ($k_{\\mathrm{close}}$, $k_{\\mathrm{open}}$, $k_{\\mathrm{chem}}$ for correct and incorrect substrates) are therefore relevant only to the calculation of $F_{\\mathrm{select}}$.\n\nThe proofreading fidelity, $F_{\\mathrm{proof}}$, is the factor by which the exonuclease activity reduces the fraction of misincorporations that are ultimately extended and fixed as errors. This depends on the kinetic partitioning of the mismatched DNA primer terminus between the polymerase extension pathway and the exonuclease excision pathway. The problem requires the calculation of this factor, $F_{\\mathrm{proof}}$, alone. Therefore, the rate constants for base selection are not needed for this specific question.\n\nWe model the fate of a newly formed mismatch at the polymerase active site. Let this state be $P_{\\mathrm{mismatch}}$. From this state, the mismatch can either be extended at the polymerase site, fixing the error, or be transferred to the exonuclease site for potential removal.\nThe two competing pathways from $P_{\\mathrm{mismatch}}$ are:\n1. Extension: $P_{\\mathrm{mismatch}} \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{ext}}} \\text{Extended Mismatch}$\n2.

The factor is given by the expression:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{proof}} = 1 + P_c$$\nwhere $P_c$ is the partitioning coefficient, defined as the ratio of the effective rate of excision to the rate of extension.\n\nThe rate of extension is simply $k_{\\mathrm{ext}}$.\nThe effective rate of excision is the rate of transfer to the exonuclease site, $k_{\\mathrm{pe}}$, multiplied by the probability that a mismatch, once at the exonuclease site, is excised rather than returned to the polymerase site.

Here, progress is the number of nucleotides incorporated. The number of nucleotides added per cycle, $N_{\\mathrm{cycle}}$, is only non-zero during the engaged phase, where $N_{\\mathrm{cycle}} = r T_{\\mathrm{eng}}$.\n$$\nV = \\frac{E[N_{\\mathrm{cycle}}]}{E[T_{\\mathrm{cycle}}]}\n$$\nThe expected number of nucleotides per cycle is:\n$$\nE[N_{\\mathrm{cycle}}] = E[r T_{\\mathrm{eng}}] = r E[T_{\\mathrm{eng}}] = r \\tau\n$$\nThe expected duration of a cycle is, by linearity of expectation:\n$$\nE[T_{\\mathrm{cycle}}] = E[T_{\\mathrm{eng}} + T_{\\mathrm{gap}}] = E[T_{\\mathrm{eng}}] + E[T_{\\mathrm{gap}}]\n$$\nThe problem provides the mean engaged time, $\\tau$, and the mean disengaged intermission time, $t_{\\mathrm{gap}}$. Substituting these expected values:\n$$\nE[T_{\\mathrm{cycle}}] = \\tau + t_{\\mathrm{gap}}\n$$\nCombining these results, the expression for the average fork velocity is:\n$$\nV = \\frac{r \\tau}{\\tau + t_{\\mathrm{gap}}}\n$$\nThis expression can be interpreted as the instantaneous rate $r$ multiplied by the duty ratio, which is the fraction of time the polymerase is actively engaged, $\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau + t_{\\mathrm{gap}}}$.\n\nFor the two conditions specified:\nAverage velocity without PCNA: $V_{-} = \\frac{r \\tau_{-}}{\\tau_{-} + t_{\\mathrm{gap},-}}$\nAverage velocity with PCNA: $V_{+} = \\frac{r \\tau_{+}}{\\tau_{+} + t_{\\mathrm{gap},+}}$\n\nFinally, we are tasked with computing the increase in fork velocity due to PCNA, $\\Delta V = V_{+} - V_{-}$.\n$$\n\\Delta V = \\frac{r \\tau_{+}}{\\tau_{+} + t_{\\mathrm{gap},+}} - \\frac{r \\tau_{-}}{\\tau_{-} + t_{\\mathrm{gap},-}}\n$$\nWe can factor out the constant rate $r$:\n$$\n\\Delta V = r \\left( \\frac{\\tau_{+}}{\\tau_{+} + t_{\\mathrm{gap},+}} - \\frac{\\tau_{-}}{\\tau_{-} + t_{\\mathrm{gap},-}} \\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided in the problem statement:\n- Instantaneous rate: $r = 60 \\ \\mathrm{nt} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- Parameters without PCNA: $\\tau_{-} = 0.30 \\ \\mathrm{s}$, $t_{\\mathrm{gap},-} = 0.30 \\ \\mathrm{s}$\n- Parameters with PCNA: $\\tau_{+} = 1.20 \\ \\mathrm{s}$, $t_{\\mathrm{gap},+} = 0.20 \\ \\mathrm{s}$\n\nFirst, calculate the velocity without PCNA, $V_{-}$:\n$$\nV_{-} = \\frac{60 \\ \\mathrm{nt} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\times 0.30 \\ \\mathrm{s}}{0.30 \\ \\mathrm{s} + 0.30 \\ \\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{18}{0.60} \\ \\mathrm{nt} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 30 \\ \\mathrm{nt} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nNext, calculate the velocity with PCNA, $V_{+}$:\n$$\nV_{+} = \\frac{60 \\ \\mathrm{nt} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\times 1.20 \\ \\mathrm{s}}{1.20 \\ \\mathrm{s} + 0.20 \\ \\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{72}{1.40} \\ \\mathrm{nt} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = \\frac{720}{14} \\ \\mathrm{nt} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = \\frac{360}{7} \\ \\mathrm{nt} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe increase in velocity is the difference $\\Delta V$:\n$$\n\\Delta V = V_{+} - V_{-} = \\left( \\frac{360}{7} - 30 \\right) \\mathrm{nt} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nTo subtract, we find a common denominator:\n$$\n\\Delta V = \\left( \\frac{360}{7} - \\frac{30 \\times 7}{7} \\right) \\mathrm{nt} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = \\left( \\frac{360 - 210}{7} \\right) \\mathrm{nt} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = \\frac{150}{7} \\ \\mathrm{nt} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nComputing the numerical value:\n$$\n\\Delta V = \\frac{150}{7} \\approx 21.42857... \\ \\mathrm{nt} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as instructed gives:\n$$\n\\Delta V \\approx 21.43 \\ \\mathrm{nt} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{21.43}$$", "id": "2963065"}]}
