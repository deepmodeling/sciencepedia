This net change is the result of two distinct processes: a deterministic shortening that occurs in every division and a stochastic lengthening that occurs with a specified probability.\n\nWe can express the net change as:\n$$\n\\Delta L = L_{added} - L_{lost}\n$$\nwhere $L_{added}$ is the length added by telomerase and $L_{lost}$ is the length lost due to replication and processing.\n\nFirst, let us analyze the deterministic shortening component, $L_{lost}$. This loss has two sources as specified in the problem statement:\n$1$. The end-replication problem, which leaves an unreplicated gap equal to the length of a terminal Okazaki fragment. This loss is given as $S_{rep} = 180$ nucleotides (nt).\n$2$. Post-replicative nucleolytic processing, which removes an additional fixed number of nucleotides. This loss is given as $S_{proc} = 30$ nt.\n\nSince these two shortening events occur in every cell division, the total deterministic length lost per division, $S_{total}$, is the sum of these two values:\n$$\nS_{total} = S_{rep} + S_{proc} = 180 + 30 = 210 \\text{ nt}\n$$\nThis is a constant loss of $210$ nt per division.\n\nNext, we analyze the stochastic lengthening component, $L_{added}$.

First, as $K$ represents a physical length scale, we must have $K > 0$. Second, the term inside the parentheses must be positive, as we are taking the $n$-th root and length cannot be complex or negative.

Thus, the numerator must be positive:\n$$\n\\Delta - s > 0 \\implies \\Delta > s\n$$\nThis is the minimal condition for a positive real $L^{\\ast}$ to exist. It has a clear physical interpretation: the average length added by telomerase when recruited must be greater than the average length lost per division to allow for a stable, non-zero equilibrium length. If $\\Delta \\le s$, the telomere will, on average, always shorten or at best stay the same length, leading to progressive shortening toward zero.\n\nPart 3: Numerical computation of $L^{\\ast}$.\n\nWe are given the following parameter values:\n- $s = 60$ base pairs (bp)\n- $\\Delta = 180$ bp\n- $K = 3.0$ kilobases (kb), which is equivalent to $3000$ bp\n- $n = 2$\n\nFirst, we verify the condition for existence: $\\Delta > s$ becomes $180 > 60$, which is true. A positive fixed point exists.\nWe now substitute these values into the expression for $L^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nL^{\\ast} = 3000 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{180 - 60}{60}\\right)^{1/2}\n$$\nPerforming the calculation within the parentheses:\n$$\nL^{\\ast} = 3000 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{120}{60}\\right)^{1/2} = 3000 \\cdot (2)^{1/2} = 3000 \\sqrt{2}\n$$\nThe result $L^{\\ast} = 3000 \\sqrt{2}$ is in units of base pairs. The problem requests the answer in kilobases. We convert the units:\n$$\nL^{\\ast}_{\\text{kb}} = \\frac{3000 \\sqrt{2}}{1000} = 3 \\sqrt{2}\n$$\nNow we compute the numerical value.
