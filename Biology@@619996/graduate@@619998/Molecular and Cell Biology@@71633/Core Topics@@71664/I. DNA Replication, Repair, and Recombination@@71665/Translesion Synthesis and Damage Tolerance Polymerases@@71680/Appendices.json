It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will now be derived.\n\nThe task is to find the expected number of mutational events across all $N$ lesions. Let us define a set of random variables. For each lesion $i$, where $i$ runs from $1$ to $N$, let $X_i$ be an indicator random variable such that $X_i = 1$ if a mutation occurs at lesion $i$, and $X_i = 0$ otherwise.\n\nThe total number of mutations in the cell, $X_{total}$, is the sum of the mutations at each lesion:\n$$X_{total} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$$\n\nThe expected total number of mutations is the expectation of this sum. By the linearity of expectation, we have:\n$$E[X_{total}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i]$$\n\nFor an indicator random variable, the expectation is equal to the probability of the event it indicates. Thus, $E[X_i] = P(X_i = 1)$. Let us denote this probability as $p_{\\mathrm{mut}}$.\n$$E[X_i] = p_{\\mathrm{mut}}$$\n\nThe problem states that the conditions for each lesion are identical. Therefore, the probability of mutation, $p_{\\mathrm{mut}}$, is the same for all $i$. The total expected number of mutations simplifies to:\n$$E[X_{total}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_{\\mathrm{mut}} = N \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{mut}}$$\n\nWe must now determine $p_{\\mathrm{mut}}$. A mutation at a lesion occurs if and only if two sequential events take place: first, TLS is engaged at the lesion, and second, an incorrect base is incorporated during this TLS event.\n\nLet $A$ be the event that TLS is engaged at a given lesion. The problem gives its probability as:\n$$P(A) = p_{\\mathrm{TLS}}$$\n\nLet $B$ be the event that an incorrect base is incorporated at that lesion. The problem gives the conditional probability of this event, given that TLS has been engaged:\n$$P(B | A) = \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{TLS}}$$\n\nThe event of a mutation at a lesion corresponds to the joint occurrence of events $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \\cap B$. The problem states that a mutation is counted only if TLS is engaged, confirming that we are interested in this intersection. Using the definition of conditional probability, the probability of the intersection is:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{mut}} = P(A \\cap B) = P(B | A) \\cdot P(A)$$\n\nSubstituting the given symbolic probabilities, we find the probability of mutation at a single lesion:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{mut}} = \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{TLS}} \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{TLS}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $p_{\\mathrm{mut}}$ back into our equation for the total expected number of mutations:\n$$E[X_{total}] = N \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{TLS}} \\cdot \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{TLS}}$$\nThis is the required analytical expression.\n\nThe next step is to evaluate this expression for the provided numerical values:\n$N = 3.6 \\times 10^{3}$\n$p_{\\mathrm{TLS}} = 0.18$\n$\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{TLS}} = 1.7 \\times 10^{-2}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$E[X_{total}] = (3.6 \\times 10^{3}) \\cdot (0.18) \\cdot (1.7 \\times 10^{-2})$$\n\nWe perform the multiplication:\n$$E[X_{total}] = (3.6 \\times 0.18 \\times 1.7) \\times (10^{3} \\times 10^{-2})$$\n$$E[X_{total}] = (0.648 \\times 1.7) \\times 10^{1}$$\n$$E[X_{total}] = 1.1016 \\times 10^{1}$$\n$$E[X_{total}] = 11.016$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The fourth significant figure is $1$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$E[X_{total}] \\approx 11.0$$\nThe expected number of mutational events per cell division is $11.0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{11.0}$$", "id": "2967493"}, {"introduction": "Unraveling the architecture of biological pathways is a central goal of molecular genetics, and epistasis analysis is a classic and powerful tool for this purpose. This problem challenges you to act as a geneticist, interpreting quantitative survival data from single and double mutants to deduce the functional relationships between key TLS proteins [@problem_id:2967462]. By systematically classifying genetic interactions as epistatic or additive, you will construct a 'wiring diagram' of the TLS network that tolerates ultraviolet-induced DNA damage.", "problem": "Ultraviolet irradiation generates bulky DNA lesions such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and (6-4) photoproducts that impede replicative DNA polymerases. In eukaryotic cells, damage tolerance during S phase is mediated by Translesion Synthesis (TLS), wherein specialized low-fidelity polymerases replicate across lesions. Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) monoubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase RAD18 facilitates recruitment of TLS polymerases to stalled forks. In mammals, POLH encodes DNA polymerase eta (Pol η), which accurately bypasses cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, whereas REV3L encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase zeta (Pol ζ), an extender polymerase that often functions with the scaffold protein REV1. Genetic epistasis analysis leverages the following well-tested principles: if two genes act in the same linear pathway, the double mutant phenotype is typically no worse than the more severe single mutant (epistasis), whereas if two genes act in independent subpathways that both contribute to survival, the double mutant phenotype tends toward the product of the single mutant effects under an independence model (additivity via multiplicative survival).

The foundational principles you may assume are the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, the concept that replicative deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerases stall at bulky or miscoding lesions, the definition that TLS proceeds via polymerase switching coordinated by monoubiquitinated Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), and the widely accepted two-step TLS model in which an “inserter” polymerase incorporates across the lesion and an “extender” polymerase elongates from the distorted primer terminus.

The experimental assays described (clonogenic survival, mutagenesis reporter, DNA fiber analysis) are standard in the field. The provided data are consistent with published scientific literature.\n2.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides a comprehensive dataset from multiple, orthogonal experiments. The data are internally consistent and sufficient to distinguish between competing mechanistic models. For instance, the greater sensitivity of *REV3L* KO cells is corroborated by the severe replication defects seen in DNA fiber analysis.\n3.  **Clarity and Objectivity**: The problem uses precise, unambiguous scientific terminology. Observations are presented as objective comparisons. The assumptions are clearly stated, which constrains the space of possible solutions appropriately.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous analysis can proceed.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe central task is to synthesize the given observations into a coherent mechanistic model for the roles of DNA polymerase eta (Pol η, encoded by *POLH*) and DNA polymerase zeta (Pol ζ, whose catalytic subunit is encoded by *REV3L*).\n\n1.  **Survival and Epistasis**: The observation that *REV3L* KO confers greater sensitivity to three different types of DNA damage than *POLH* KO suggests that *REV3L* plays a more general or critical role in TLS than *POLH*. The genetic epistasis observed, where the *POLH*;*REV3L* DKO phenotype is no more severe than the *REV3L* KO phenotype (*POLH*;*REV3L* DKO $\\approx$ *REV3L* KO), is highly informative. This relationship implies that *POLH* and *REV3L* function in the same genetic pathway to handle these lesions and that *REV3L* acts downstream of *POLH*. If *REV3L*'s function is required for the pathway to be completed, then the additional loss of an upstream component (*POLH*) will have no further effect. The same logic applies to the *REV1*;*REV3L* epistasis.\n\n2.  **Two-Step TLS Model**: The foundational principles state that TLS involves an \"inserter\" and an \"extender\" polymerase. The epistasis data place *REV3L* downstream of both *POLH* and *REV1* (a known inserter/scaffold). This strongly supports a model where *POLH* and *REV1* act as inserters, and *REV3L* acts as a common extender.\n\n3.  **Catalytic Requirement**: The complementation experiment, showing that only catalytically active *REV3L* can rescue the survival defect, is definitive proof that the DNA polymerase activity of *REV3L* is essential for its function. This refutes any model proposing a purely structural or signaling role.\n\n4.  **Replication Phenotype**: The DNA fiber analysis in *REV3L* KO cells reveals long post-replicative ssDNA gaps and increased HR-dependent fork restart. This is the classic cellular phenotype for a failure in the extension step of TLS. After an inserter places a nucleotide opposite the lesion, the resulting distorted primer-template junction stalls the replicative polymerase. If the specialized extender polymerase is absent, this stall persists, leading to a gap that must be filled by other means, often involving HR. This observation provides direct cell-biological evidence for *REV3L*'s role as an extender.\n\n5.  **Mutagenesis**: *REV3L* (Pol ζ) is known to be a highly error-prone polymerase. Its loss, as observed, reduces overall mutagenesis because a major source of replication errors is eliminated. Conversely, *POLH* (Pol η) is known to be uniquely capable of error-free bypass of CPDs by inserting two adenines. The observed increase in mutagenesis after UVB in *POLH* KO cells is the expected result of error-prone polymerases (like *REV3L*/Pol ζ) substituting for the error-free function of *POLH*.\n\n**Synthesis**: The collective evidence points to a single, consistent model: *POLH* acts as a relatively specialized inserter, particularly for CPDs. Other polymerases, such as *REV1*, act as inserters for other types of lesions. *REV3L* functions as a common extender polymerase, required to elongate the DNA strand after any of these various inserters have acted. Because it is a necessary component for multiple TLS pathways that handle a wide range of lesions, its loss is more broadly detrimental to cell survival than the loss of a single, more specialized inserter like *POLH*.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. REV3L primarily inserts nucleotides opposite cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and other lesions, while POLH is specialized for extension; therefore REV3L loss is broadly deleterious and POLH loss is lesion-specific.**\nThis model inverts the roles of the two polymerases. The mutagenesis data (error-free bypass of CPDs by *POLH*) and the DNA fiber data (extension defect in *REV3L* KO) contradict this arrangement. Furthermore, the epistasis data place *REV3L* downstream of *POLH*, not upstream.\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. REV3L functions downstream of multiple inserter polymerases to extend from distorted primer termini generated opposite diverse lesions; therefore its loss blocks many TLS routes, causing stronger sensitivity than POLH loss, which mainly affects insertion opposite cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers.**\nThis model perfectly matches the synthesis derived from all provided observations. It correctly identifies *REV3L* as the common extender, explaining its general importance and the severe phenotype of its loss. It correctly places *REV3L* downstream of inserters like *POLH*. It accounts for the survival hierarchy, the epistasis data, the DNA fiber phenotype, and the mutagenesis results.\n**Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**C. POLH is the common extender acting downstream of many inserters, whereas REV3L is a specialized inserter across abasic sites; the data reflect that POLH loss should be more severe, but experimental variability reverses the observed trend.**\nThis option proposes incorrect roles and, more critically, dismisses robust and reproducible data as \"experimental variability.\" A scientific model must explain data, not ignore it. The premise that *POLH* is a common extender is contradicted by its relatively specialized role and the less severe *POLH* KO phenotype.\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. REV3L acts primarily as a signaling factor to recruit recombination proteins and is not catalytically required for TLS; the increased sensitivity arises from checkpoint defects rather than defective extension.**\nThis model is directly and decisively falsified by the *REV3L* complementation experiment. The fact that a catalytically inactive version of *REV3L* cannot restore survival proves that its enzymatic (polymerase) activity is essential, refuting a purely non-catalytic signaling role.\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. REV3L loss destabilizes PCNA monoubiquitination at lysine 164, globally abolishing polymerase switching; POLH loss leaves switching intact, thus showing less sensitivity even when TLS fails.**\nThis model contradicts a key assumption of the problem statement, which specifies that PCNA monoubiquitination at lysine $164$ is to be considered intact. One cannot propose a solution that violates the stated premises of the problem.\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2967482"}]}
