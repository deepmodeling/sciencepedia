Polymerization and dissociation are competing, independent Poisson processes. The expected duration of a single binding event is the mean lifetime of the bound state, which is the reciprocal of the dissociation rate, $T_{\\mathrm{bound}} = 1/k_{\\mathrm{off}}$.\nDuring this time, the polymerase incorporates nucleotides at a rate of $k_{\\mathrm{pol}}$.

This time is the sum of the fundamental catalytic step time and any additional time spent on proofreading.\nThe time for a single catalytic step is $1/k_{\\mathrm{pol}}$. Misincorporation occurs with probability $q_0$. If the epsilon subunit is present, a fraction $s$ of these misincorporations are corrected, each correction costing an additional time $t_{\\mathrm{exo}}$. The average proofreading time added per attempted incorporation is $q_0 s t_{\\mathrm{exo}}$.\nThus, the total expected time per net incorporated nucleotide, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{poly}}$, is:\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{poly}} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{pol}}} + q_0 s t_{\\mathrm{exo}}$$\nThe effective polymerization rate is $v_{\\mathrm{poly, eff}} = 1/\\tau_{\\mathrm{poly}}$.\n\nWhen epsilon proofreading is active ($s > 0$):\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{poly}}^{\\epsilon+} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{pol}}} + q_0 s t_{\\mathrm{exo}}$$\n$$v_{\\mathrm{poly, eff}}^{\\epsilon+} = \\left(\\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{pol}}} + q_0 s t_{\\mathrm{exo}}\\right)^{-1}$$\nWhen epsilon is absent ($s=0$):\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{poly}}^{\\epsilon-} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{pol}}}$$\n$$v_{\\mathrm{poly, eff}}^{\\epsilon-} = k_{\\mathrm{pol}}$$\n\n**(iii) Strand-specific effective speeds ($v_{\\mathrm{lead}}$, $v_{\\mathrm{lag}}$)**\nThe overall effective speed on a strand is the reciprocal of the total time per nucleotide, which includes polymerization time ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{poly}}$), dissociation overhead ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{dissoc}}$), and, for the lagging strand, fragment cycling overhead ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{frag}}$).\n\nThe overhead from dissociation is the average dead time from rebinding, distributed over the number of nucleotides synthesized between dissociation events. That number is the processivity, $P$.\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{dissoc}} = \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{rebind}}}{P}$$\nFor the leading strand, the total time per nucleotide is $\\tau_{\\mathrm{lead}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{poly}} + \\tau_{\\mathrm{dissoc}}$.\nThe effective speed of the leading strand is:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{lead}} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{lead}}} = \\left(\\tau_{\\mathrm{poly}} + \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{rebind}}}{P}\\right)^{-1}$$\nThe lagging strand is synthesized in Okazaki fragments of length $L_{\\mathrm{ok}}$. Each fragment requires additional overhead time for priming and polymerase cycling.\nWith the clamp, overhead per fragment is $T_{\\mathrm{overhead, frag}}^{\\mathrm{clamp}} = t_{\\mathrm{primase}} + t_{\\mathrm{load}}$.\nWithout the clamp, overhead per fragment is $T_{\\mathrm{overhead, frag}}^{\\mathrm{no\\ clamp}} = t_{\\mathrm{primase}} + t_{\\mathrm{rebind}}$.\nThis overhead time per fragment, when averaged per nucleotide, is $\\tau_{\\mathrm{frag}} = T_{\\mathrm{overhead, frag}}/L_{\\mathrm{ok}}$.\nThe total time per nucleotide for the lagging strand is $\\tau_{\\mathrm{lag}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{poly}} + \\tau_{\\mathrm{dissoc}} + \\tau_{\\mathrm{frag}}$.\nThe effective speed of the lagging strand is:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{lag}} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{lag}}} = \\left(\\tau_{\\mathrm{poly}} + \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{rebind}}}{P} + \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{overhead, frag}}}{L_{\\mathrm{ok}}}\\right)^{-1}$$\nThese expressions depend on the presence of the clamp (which sets $P$ and $T_{\\mathrm{overhead, frag}}$) and epsilon (which sets $\\tau_{\\mathrm{poly}}$).\n\n**2) Fork Speed Computation**\nThe replication fork speed is limited by the slower of the two strands: $v_{\\mathrm{fork}} = \\min(v_{\\mathrm{lead}}, v_{\\mathrm{lag}})$. Since $\\tau_{\\mathrm{lag}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{lead}} + \\tau_{\\mathrm{frag}}$ and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{frag}} > 0$, it is always true that $\\tau_{\\mathrm{lag}} > \\tau_{\\mathrm{lead}}$, which implies $v_{\\mathrm{lag}} < v_{\\mathrm{lead}}$. Therefore, the fork speed is determined by the lagging strand speed, $v_{\\mathrm{fork}} = v_{\\mathrm{lag}}$.\n\nCase 1: Both beta clamp and epsilon proofreading are present (`with`).\nThe total time per nucleotide on the lagging strand is:\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{with}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{lag}}^{\\mathrm{clamp}, \\epsilon+} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{poly}}^{\\epsilon+} + \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{rebind}}}{P_{\\mathrm{clamp}}} + \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{primase}} + t_{\\mathrm{load}}}{L_{\\mathrm{ok}}}$$\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{with}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{pol}}} + q_0 s t_{\\mathrm{exo}}\\right) + \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{rebind}}}{k_{\\mathrm{pol}}/k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{\\mathrm{clamp}}} + \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{primase}} + t_{\\mathrm{load}}}{L_{\\mathrm{ok}}}$$\nSubstituting values:\n$\\tau_{\\mathrm{with}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{900} + (10^{-5})(0.99)(0.01)\\right) + \\frac{0.2}{9 \\times 10^5} + \\frac{0.2 + 0.05}{1500}$\n$\\tau_{\\mathrm{with}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{900} + 9.9 \\times 10^{-8}\\right) + \\frac{2}{9} \\times 10^{-6} + \\frac{0.25}{1500}$\n$\\tau_{\\mathrm{with}} \\approx 0.001111111 + 0.000000099 + 0.000000222 + 0.000166667 \\approx 0.001278099 \\ \\mathrm{s/nt}$\nThe fork speed is $v_{\\mathrm{fork, with}} = 1/\\tau_{\\mathrm{with}} \\approx 1/0.001278099 \\approx 782.41 \\ \\mathrm{nt/s}$.\n\nCase 2: Both beta clamp and epsilon proofreading are absent (`without`).\nThe total time per nucleotide on the lagging strand is:\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{without}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{lag}}^{\\mathrm{no\\ clamp}, \\epsilon-} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{poly}}^{\\epsilon-} + \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{rebind}}}{P_{\\mathrm{no\\ clamp}}} + \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{primase}} + t_{\\mathrm{rebind}}}{L_{\\mathrm{ok}}}$$\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{without}} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{pol}}} + \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{rebind}}}{k_{\\mathrm{pol}}/k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{\\mathrm{no\\ clamp}}} + \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{primase}} + t_{\\mathrm{rebind}}}{L_{\\mathrm{ok}}}$$\nSubstituting values:\n$\\tau_{\\mathrm{without}} = \\frac{1}{900} + \\frac{0.2}{90} + \\frac{0.2 + 0.2}{1500} = \\frac{1}{900} + \\frac{1}{450} + \\frac{0.4}{1500}$\n$\\tau_{\\mathrm{without}} = \\frac{1}{900} + \\frac{2}{900} + \\frac{1}{3750} = \\frac{3}{900} + \\frac{1}{3750} = \\frac{1}{300} + \\frac{1}{3750}$\nTo sum the fractions: $\\frac{1}{300} + \\frac{1}{3750} = \\frac{12.5}{3750} + \\frac{1}{3750} = \\frac{13.5}{3750} = \\frac{27}{7500} = \\frac{9}{2500} = 0.0036 \\ \\mathrm{s/nt}$.\nThe fork speed is $v_{\\mathrm{fork, without}} = 1/\\tau_{\\mathrm{without}} = 1/0.0036 = 2500/9 \\approx 277.78 \\ \\mathrm{nt/s}$.\n\n**3) Compute the ratio $R$**\nThe ratio $R$ is defined as $R \\equiv T_{\\mathrm{without}}/T_{\\mathrm{with}}$.

Stalling of the replication fork occurs when the torque reaches the stall value $\\tau_{\\star}$. To guarantee that the fork never stalls, the torque must not increase towards this value. Assuming the initial torque $\\tau(0)$ is less than $\\tau_{\\star}$, a sufficient condition to prevent stalling is that the rate of change of torque is non-positive.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tau}{dt} \\le 0\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\frac{d\\tau}{dt}$:\n$$\n\\frac{2\\pi C}{L} \\left( \\frac{v}{h} - R_{\\mathrm{out}} \\right) \\le 0\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{2\\pi C}{L}$ consists of positive physical constants ($C$, the torsional modulus, is positive definite; $L$ is a positive length). Therefore, this prefactor is positive, and the inequality simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{v}{h} - R_{\\mathrm{out}} \\le 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad R_{\\mathrm{out}} \\ge \\frac{v}{h}\n$$\nThis condition states that to prevent the buildup of torsional stress, the rate of supercoil removal by gyrase must be at least equal to the rate of supercoil generation by the fork. The minimal total removal flux, denoted $R_{\\mathrm{out}}^{\\ast}$, corresponds to the case of equality, where the removal rate exactly balances the generation rate, leading to a steady state with $\\frac{d\\tau}{dt} = 0$.\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{out}}^{\\ast} = \\frac{v}{h}\n$$\nThis derivation shows that the minimal required gyrase activity depends only on the fork velocity and the DNA helical pitch, and is independent of the elastic properties ($C$) or length ($L$) of the domain, or the stall torque ($\\tau_{\\star}$).\n\nFinally, we evaluate $R_{\\mathrm{out}}^{\\ast}$ numerically using the provided values: $v = 900\\,\\mathrm{bp\\,s}^{-1}$ and $h = 10.5\\,\\mathrm{bp\\,turn}^{-1}$.\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{out}}^{\\ast} = \\frac{900\\,\\mathrm{bp\\,s^{-1}}}{10.5\\,\\mathrm{bp\\,turn^{-1}}} = \\frac{900}{10.5}\\,\\mathrm{turns\\,s^{-1}} \\approx 85.71428...\\,\\mathrm{turns\\,s^{-1}}\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as instructed, we obtain the minimal total catalytic rate required to prevent stalling.\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{out}}^{\\ast} \\approx 85.7\\,\\mathrm{turns\\,s^{-1}}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{85.7}\n$$", "id": "2933817"}]}
