Productive RAD51 filaments must nucleate on RPA-coated ssDNA, displace RPA, and extend to form a competent presynaptic filament capable of homology search and displacement loop (D-loop) formation.\n- BRCA2 contains multiple BRC repeats that bind RAD51 monomers and small oligomers in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-bound state, chaperoning their delivery to ssDNA and suppressing promiscuous binding of RAD51 to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA).\n- The C-terminal DNA-binding domain of BRCA2, together with DSS1, binds ssDNA and dsDNA junctions and stabilizes nascent RAD51 filaments by aiding RPA displacement and capping filament ends; this domain also contributes to protection of stalled replication forks but is not required for defining homology per se.\n- Excess RAD51 in the absence of proper chaperoning can form nonproductive filaments on dsDNA, which are inhibitory or toxic to genome stability.\n\nYou perform the following assays after a site-specific DSB is induced in S phase:\n\n- Single-molecule imaging of RAD51 on resected ssDNA tracks measures the initial nucleation frequency per unit ssDNA, the average filament growth length before catastrophe, and the dwell time of RAD51 clusters.\n- A green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based gene conversion reporter quantifies accurate HDR via synthesis-dependent strand annealing.\n- A single-strand annealing (SSA) reporter quantifies Rad52-dependent end joining between repeats.\n- Chromatin fractionation and immunofluorescence assess RAD51 binding to bulk chromatin (enriched for dsDNA) and the kinetics of RPA persistence at breaks.\n- RAD51 overexpression is used to test for dsDNA misloading toxicity.\n\nWhich option best captures the differential impact of BRC-mut (Variant X) versus DBD-mut (Variant Y) on RAD51 filament dynamics and HDR outcomes, given the foundational facts above?\n\nA. BRC-mut shows near-normal nucleation on ssDNA because the C-terminal DNA-binding domain can recruit RAD51; however, filaments fail to extend without intact BRC repeats, so average growth length and dwell time are reduced. DBD-mut, by contrast, nucleates poorly due to loss of DNA binding, but once nucleated via residual pathways its filaments are unusually stable and long because intact BRC repeats compensate at the extension stage. Both variants reduce gene conversion similarly, with no effect on SSA.\n\nB. Both BRC-mut and DBD-mut equivalently reduce RAD51 nucleation, extension, and stability because either domain is individually sufficient for RAD51 delivery and filament maintenance; consequently, both variants cause indistinguishable decreases in gene conversion with proportional increases in SSA, and neither alters RAD51 misloading onto dsDNA.\n\nC. BRC-mut primarily impairs RAD51 nucleation on RPA-coated ssDNA because the BRC repeats are required to chaperone ATP-bound RAD51 to ssDNA and to suppress dsDNA binding; as a result, early RAD51 focus formation and nucleation frequency are low, RPA persists at breaks, and HDR by gene conversion drops, while RAD51 overexpression exacerbates nonproductive dsDNA binding and toxicity. In contrast, DBD-mut with intact BRC repeats can still chaperone RAD51 and seed initial nucleation events, but defective ssDNA binding and DSS1-dependent stabilization compromise RPA displacement and filament maturation, yielding short, unstable filaments with reduced dwell time and growth before catastrophe. Gene conversion decreases, RPA persists transiently, SSA increases modestly as a compensatory pathway, and dsDNA misloading is not markedly enhanced at baseline because BRC-mediated suppression of dsDNA binding remains.\n\nD. BRC repeats physiologically inhibit RAD51 assembly; therefore, BRC-mut relieves this inhibition, increasing both nucleation and extension of RAD51 filaments and elevating gene conversion. DBD-mut eliminates BRCA2 DNA tethering and thus prevents RAD51 overloading on dsDNA, decreasing toxicity under RAD51 overexpression. Consequently, BRC-mut shows hyper-recombination with reduced SSA, whereas DBD-mut shows a mild HDR defect without changes in filament dynamics.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Cell line**: A human cell line null for Breast Cancer Type 2 susceptibility protein ($\\text{BRCA2}$).\n- **Variants**:\n    - **Variant $\\text{X}$ (BRC-mut)**: Alanine substitutions in $\\text{BRC}$ repeats abolish high-affinity interaction with $\\text{RAD51}$ recombinase.

The functions ascribed to $\\text{BRCA2}$, its domains ($\\text{BRC}$ repeats, $\\text{DBD}$), and associated proteins ($\\text{RAD51}$, $\\text{RPA}$, $\\text{DSS1}$) are consistent with the current scientific consensus. The experimental setup, involving specific mutations and defined assays, is a standard and logical approach to dissecting protein function. The problem is well-posed, objective, self-contained, and non-trivial. It asks for a logical deduction based on a provided set of axioms (the foundational facts). The problem is therefore valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation from First Principles\n\n**Analysis of Variant $\\text{X}$ (BRC-mut)**\nThe defining feature of this variant is the loss of high-affinity interaction between the $\\text{BRC}$ repeats and $\\text{RAD51}$.\n1.  **$\\text{RAD51}$ Nucleation**: According to Foundational Fact 2, the $\\text{BRC}$ repeats are responsible for chaperoning $\\text{RAD51}$ and delivering it to $\\text{ssDNA}$. Abolishing this interaction will severely cripple the initial loading, or nucleation, of $\\text{RAD51}$ onto the $\\text{RPA}$-coated $\\text{ssDNA}$ at the double-strand break ($\\text{DSB}$) site. The nucleation frequency is predicted to be very low.\n2.  **$\\text{RPA}$ Displacement and Filament Extension**: Since nucleation is the prerequisite for filament growth, a failure in nucleation means that subsequent displacement of $\\text{RPA}$ and filament extension will also fail. Consequently, $\\text{RPA}$ will persist at the break sites.\n3.  **Filament Stability**: Without proper nucleation and a sustained supply of chaperoned $\\text{RAD51}$, any stochastically formed $\\text{RAD51}$ clusters will be sparse, short, and unstable. The average growth length and dwell time will be significantly reduced.\n4.  **$\\text{dsDNA}$ Binding**: Foundational Fact 2 also states that $\\text{BRC}$ repeats suppress promiscuous binding of $\\text{RAD51}$ to $\\text{dsDNA}$. The BRC-mut variant lacks this suppressive function. This will lead to mis-localization of $\\text{RAD51}$ onto bulk chromatin ($\\text{dsDNA}$). According to Foundational Fact 4, this is toxic, and this toxicity should be exacerbated upon $\\text{RAD51}$ overexpression.\n5.  **$\\text{HDR}$ Outcome**: The inability to form a competent presynaptic filament makes homology search and strand invasion impossible. Therefore, gene conversion ($\\text{HDR}$) will be drastically reduced. The cell may default to alternative, more error-prone repair pathways, such as single-strand annealing ($\\text{SSA}$), if the substrate is appropriate.\n\n**Analysis of Variant $\\text{Y}$ (DBD-mut)**\nThe defining feature of this variant is the loss of the C-terminal domain's ability to bind $\\text{ssDNA}$ and interact with $\\text{DSS1}$, while the $\\text{BRC}$ repeats remain intact.\n1.  **$\\text{RAD51}$ Nucleation**: According to Foundational Fact 2, the intact $\\text{BRC}$ repeats can still bind and chaperone $\\text{RAD51}$ to the DNA break. Therefore, the initial step of $\\text{RAD51}$ nucleation on $\\text{ssDNA}$ should still occur.\n2.  **Filament Stability and Maturation**: According to Foundational Fact 3, the C-terminal domain's function is to bind DNA and *stabilize* the nascent $\\text{RAD51}$ filament, promoting $\\text{RPA}$ displacement and capping the filament. The loss of this function means that while nucleation can be seeded, the resulting filament will be unstable. It will be prone to disassembly (catastrophe) and will be inefficient at displacing the tightly bound $\\text{RPA}$.\n3.  **Filament Dynamics**: We predict that nucleation can occur, but the filaments will be short-lived and fail to extend properly. This will manifest as reduced average growth length and dwell time. $\\text{RPA}$ will persist, perhaps transiently, because of inefficient displacement.\n4.  **$\\text{dsDNA}$ Binding**: Since the $\\text{BRC}$ repeats are intact, the function of suppressing $\\text{RAD51}$ binding to $\\text{dsDNA}$ (Foundational Fact 2) is preserved. Therefore, we do not predict a significant increase in nonproductive $\\text{dsDNA}$ binding or associated toxicity at baseline expression levels.\n5.  **$\\text{HDR}$ Outcome**: The formation of short, unstable filaments is insufficient to promote efficient homology search. Gene conversion ($\\text{HDR}$) will be reduced. As in the case of BRC-mut, a failure in $\\text{HDR}$ may lead to a modest increase in the use of compensatory pathways like $\\text{SSA}$.\n\n**Differential Prediction Summary**\n- **BRC-mut**: Primary defect is in **nucleation**. Consequent outcomes are very low $\\text{HDR}$, persistent $\\text{RPA}$, and increased toxic $\\text{dsDNA}$ binding.\n- **DBD-mut**: Primary defect is in **filament stabilization** post-nucleation. Consequent outcomes are low $\\text{HDR}$ and short, unstable filaments, but without the toxic $\\text{dsDNA}$ binding phenotype.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. BRC-mut shows near-normal nucleation on ssDNA because the C-terminal DNA-binding domain can recruit RAD51...**\nThis is incorrect. Foundational Fact 2 explicitly states that the $\\text{BRC}$ repeats chaperone $\\text{RAD51}$ for delivery to $\\text{ssDNA}$. The C-terminal domain's role is stabilization (Fact 3), not primary recruitment for nucleation. The premise is flawed. The description of DBD-mut leading to \"unusually stable and long\" filaments is also incorrect; loss of the stabilizing domain (Fact 3) would have the opposite effect.\n\n**B. Both BRC-mut and DBD-mut equivalently reduce RAD51 nucleation, extension, and stability...**\nThis is incorrect. The problem is designed to test the distinct functions of two different domains. Foundational Facts 2 and 3 assign separate, non-equivalent roles to the $\\text{BRC}$ repeats and the C-terminal $\\text{DBD}$. Thus, the impact of their respective mutations cannot be equivalent. Furthermore, the claim that neither alters $\\text{RAD51}$ misloading onto $\\text{dsDNA}$ is incorrect for BRC-mut, as it lacks the suppressive function of the $\\text{BRC}$ repeats (Fact 2).\n\n**C. BRC-mut primarily impairs RAD51 nucleation on RPA-coated ssDNA because the BRC repeats are required to chaperone ATP-bound RAD51 to ssDNA and to suppress dsDNA binding; as a result, early RAD51 focus formation and nucleation frequency are low, RPA persists at breaks, and HDR by gene conversion drops, while RAD51 overexpression exacerbates nonproductive dsDNA binding and toxicity. In contrast, DBD-mut with intact BRC repeats can still chaperone RAD51 and seed initial nucleation events, but defective ssDNA binding and DSS1-dependent stabilization compromise RPA displacement and filament maturation, yielding short, unstable filaments with reduced dwell time and growth before catastrophe. Gene conversion decreases, RPA persists transiently, SSA increases modestly as a compensatory pathway, and dsDNA misloading is not markedly enhanced at baseline because BRC-mediated suppression of dsDNA binding remains.**\nThis is correct. This option accurately describes the distinct consequences of each mutation, precisely as derived from the foundational facts. It correctly identifies the primary defect of BRC-mut as nucleation failure and toxic $\\text{dsDNA}$ binding, and the primary defect of DBD-mut as filament instability post-nucleation without the toxicity. All predicted experimental outcomes are logical consequences of these primary defects.\n\n**D. BRC repeats physiologically inhibit RAD51 assembly; therefore, BRC-mut relieves this inhibition...**\nThis is incorrect. This statement directly contradicts Foundational Fact 2, which establishes a positive, chaperoning role for the $\\text{BRC}$ repeats in promoting filament assembly on $\\text{ssDNA}$. The entire premise for the BRC-mut analysis in this option is factually inverted. The description of the DBD-mut function is also confused, incorrectly assigning the role of preventing $\\text{dsDNA}$ overloading to the $\\text{DBD}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2948426"}, {"introduction": "The final outcome of homologous recombination is not uniform; it can result in either a simple gene conversion (non-crossover) or a reciprocal exchange of chromosome arms (crossover).

From the first equation, we express $P(\\text{NCO}|\\text{res})$ in terms of $P(\\text{CO}|\\text{res})$:\n$$ P(\\text{NCO}|\\text{res}) = \\beta \\cdot P(\\text{CO}|\\text{res}) $$\nSubstituting this into the second equation:\n$$ \\beta \\cdot P(\\text{CO}|\\text{res}) + P(\\text{CO}|\\text{res}) = 1 $$\n$$ P(\\text{CO}|\\text{res}) (1 + \\beta) = 1 $$\nSolving for $P(\\text{CO}|\\text{res})$ gives:\n$$ P(\\text{CO}|\\text{res}) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\beta} $$\nConsequently, the conditional probability of an NCO from resolution is:\n$$ P(\\text{NCO}|\\text{res}) = 1 - P(\\text{CO}|\\text{res}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{1 + \\beta} = \\frac{1 + \\beta - 1}{1 + \\beta} = \\frac{\\beta}{1 + \\beta} $$\nNow we can determine the contributions from the resolution branch ($2b$) to the total proportions of CO and NCO.\n- Contribution to CO: The probability of this path is the probability of dHJ formation, multiplied by the probability of resolution, multiplied by the conditional probability of a CO from resolution.\n$$ P(\\text{CO})_{\\text{res}} = f_{\\text{dHJ}} \\cdot (1 - \\delta) \\cdot P(\\text{CO}|\\text{res}) = f_{\\text{dHJ}} (1 - \\delta) \\frac{1}{1 + \\beta} $$\n- Contribution to NCO:\n$$ P(\\text{NCO})_{\\text{res}} = f_{\\text{dHJ}} \\cdot (1 - \\delta) \\cdot P(\\text{NCO}|\\text{res}) = f_{\\text{dHJ}} (1 - \\delta) \\frac{\\beta}{1 + \\beta} $$\n\nThe total expected proportion of crossovers, $P(\\text{CO})$, is the sum of contributions to CO from all possible pathways. From our analysis, only the resolution of a dHJ can produce a crossover.\n$$ P(\\text{CO}) = 0 + 0 + f_{\\text{dHJ}} (1 - \\delta) \\frac{1}{1 + \\beta} $$\n$$ P(\\text{CO}) = \\frac{f_{\\text{dHJ}}(1 - \\delta)}{1 + \\beta} $$\n\nThe total expected proportion of non-crossovers, $P(\\text{NCO})$, is the sum of contributions to NCO from all pathways (SDSA, dHJ dissolution, and dHJ resolution).\n$$ P(\\text{NCO}) = (1 - f_{\\text{dHJ}}) + f_{\\text{dHJ}} \\delta + f_{\\text{dHJ}} (1 - \\delta) \\frac{\\beta}{1 + \\beta} $$\nA more direct method to find $P(\\text{NCO})$ is to use the identity $P(\\text{NCO}) = 1 - P(\\text{CO})$, since the problem assumes no other outcomes.\n$$ P(\\text{NCO}) = 1 - P(\\text{CO}) = 1 - \\frac{f_{\\text{dHJ}}(1 - \\delta)}{1 + \\beta} $$\nThis provides the required closed-form expressions for the proportions of CO and NCO products as functions of $f_{\\text{dHJ}}$, $\\delta$, and $\\beta$.
