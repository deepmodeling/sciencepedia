Let's explore a hypothetical scenario based on their experimental design.\n\nA culture of *E. coli* is grown for many generations in a medium where the sole nitrogen source is the heavy isotope, $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$. Consequently, all the nitrogen atoms in the bacterial DNA are $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$. These bacteria are then transferred to a new medium containing only the light isotope, $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$, as the nitrogen source. They are allowed to grow for a period of time exactly equal to one generation, meaning each cell undergoes a single round of DNA replication.\n\nAfter this single generation, the DNA from the entire bacterial population is extracted, purified, and subjected to cesium chloride (CsCl) density gradient centrifugation. This technique separates macromolecules based on their buoyant density.\n\nInstead of the biologically accurate semiconservative model, assume that DNA replication follows a hypothetical **conservative model**. In this model, the original parental DNA double helix remains entirely intact after serving as a template, and a completely new, separate daughter DNA double helix is synthesized from precursors in the new medium.\n\nWhich of the following descriptions accurately predicts the result observed in the density gradient tube after centrifugation under this hypothetical conservative replication model?\n\nA. Two distinct bands of DNA of equal intensity: one at a high density corresponding to pure $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ DNA, and one at a lower density corresponding to pure $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ DNA.\nB. A single band of DNA at an intermediate density, located precisely halfway between the densities of pure $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ DNA and pure $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ DNA.\nC. A single, very broad band of DNA, spreading continuously from the intermediate density position to the light (${}^{14}\\mathrm{N}$) density position.\nD.

After transfer to a medium containing only $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$, all newly synthesized nitrogen is light, so new DNA is light-light (denote these as LL) and bands at a lower buoyant density $\\rho_{L}$.\n\nConsider $N$ initial HH duplexes. After one generation (one round of replication), conservative replication yields, for each initial HH duplex, one unchanged HH duplex (the parental molecule) and one newly synthesized LL duplex. Therefore, the total DNA after one generation consists of $N$ HH duplexes and $N$ LL duplexes, i.e.,\n$$\n\\text{HH count} = N, \\quad \\text{LL count} = N, \\quad \\text{total} = 2N.\n$$\nNo hybrid heavy-light (HL) duplexes are produced under conservative replication, so there is no DNA at any intermediate density $\\rho_{I}$ between $\\rho_{H}$ and $\\rho_{L}$.\n\nIn CsCl density gradient centrifugation, DNA separates by buoyant density; thus HH duplexes band at $\\rho_{H}$ and LL duplexes band at $\\rho_{L}$.

It is a standard problem in quantitative biology that can be solved from first principles as requested.\n\nLet $M(t)$ be the total mass of duplex deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the culture at time $t$.

The problem specifies that $t_p  \\tau_d$ and no locus undergoes a second round of replication. This implies that the only replication events occurring are the conversion of HH DNA to HL DNA. The formation of LL DNA, which would require the replication of HL templates, does not occur within the time frame $t_p$. Thus, for all $t$ in the interval $[0, t_p]$, we have $M_{LL}(t) = 0$.\n\nThe total mass of DNA synthesized over the time interval $[0, t_p]$ is the increase in total DNA mass:\n$$\\Delta M_{syn}(t_p) = M(t_p) - M(0) = M_0 \\exp(\\mu t_p) - M_0 = M_0 (\\exp(\\mu t_p) - 1)$$\nThis newly synthesized mass, $\\Delta M_{syn}(t_p)$, consists entirely of light strands.\n\nAccording to the stoichiometry of semiconservative replication, the synthesis of new strands requires an equal mass of template strands. Since all DNA at $t=0$ is HH, the template strands are exclusively heavy strands.
