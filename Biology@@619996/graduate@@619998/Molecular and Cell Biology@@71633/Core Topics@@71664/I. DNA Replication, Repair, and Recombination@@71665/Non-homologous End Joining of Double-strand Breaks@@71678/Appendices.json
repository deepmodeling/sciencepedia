The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary quantitative information (probabilities) and a clear condition (independence) to allow for a unique, computable solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or logical flaws.\n\nStep 3: Verdict\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires computing the fraction of double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are immediately ligatable. A DSB is formed by the breakage of both strands of a DNA duplex, resulting in two ends. To rejoin these two ends via NHEJ, two separate ligation events must occur, one for each strand.\n\nLet us define the probabilities for the chemical state of a single, randomly selected terminus, based on the provided population fractions.\nThe state of a 3' terminus can be either $3'\\text{-OH}$ (ligatable) or $3'\\text{-PG}$ (non-ligatable). The probability of a 3' terminus being a phosphoglycolate is given as $P(3'\\text{-PG}) = 0.4$. Since there are no other blocking lesions, the probability of a 3' terminus being a hydroxyl, which we denote as $p_{3'\\text{-OH}}$, is the complement:\n$$p_{3'\\text{-OH}} = 1 - P(3'\\text{-PG}) = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6$$\n\nSimilarly, the state of a 5' terminus can be either $5'\\text{-P}$ (ligatable) or $5'\\text{-OH}$ (non-ligatable). The probability of a 5' terminus being a hydroxyl is given as $P(5'\\text{-OH}) = 0.25$. The probability of a 5' terminus being a phosphate, which we denote as $p_{5'\\text{-P}}$, is therefore:\n$$p_{5'\\text{-P}} = 1 - P(5'\\text{-OH}) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$$\n\nA single DSB consists of two ends. When these two ends are brought together, two new phosphodiester bonds must be formed to restore the continuity of the DNA backbone.\nLet the two ends of the DSB be End 1 and End 2.\nEnd 1 possesses one 3' terminus and one 5' terminus.\nEnd 2 possesses one 3' terminus and one 5' terminus.\nThe first ligation joins the 3' terminus of End 1 to the 5' terminus of End 2. This requires the 3' terminus of End 1 to be $3'\\text{-OH}$ and the 5' terminus of End 2 to be $5'\\text{-P}$.\nThe second ligation joins the 3' terminus of End 2 to the 5' terminus of End 1. This requires the 3' terminus of End 2 to be $3'\\text{-OH}$ and the 5' terminus of End 1 to be $5'\\text{-P}$.\n\nA DSB is \"immediately ligatable\" only if *both* ligation events can occur without prior enzymatic modification. This means that all four termini involved must have the correct chemical state. Specifically:\n1. The first 3' terminus must be $3'\\text{-OH}$.\n2. The second 3' terminus must be $3'\\text{-OH}$.\n3. The first 5' terminus must be $5'\\text{-P}$.\n4. The second 5' terminus must be $5'\\text{-P}$.\n\nThe problem states that the chemical states of the termini are independent. Therefore, the probability that a DSB is immediately ligatable, $P_{\\text{ligatable}}$, is the product of the probabilities of these four independent events. A DSB has two 3' termini and two 5' termini, and each must be in a ligatable state.\n\nThe probability for both 3' termini to be $3'\\text{-OH}$ is:\n$$P(\\text{both } 3' \\text{ termini are OH}) = p_{3'\\text{-OH}} \\times p_{3'\\text{-OH}} = (p_{3'\\text{-OH}})^{2}$$\nThe probability for both 5' termini to be $5'\\text{-P}$ is:\n$$P(\\text{both } 5' \\text{ termini are P}) = p_{5'\\text{-P}} \\times p_{5'\\text{-P}} = (p_{5'\\text{-P}})^{2}$$\n\nCombining these, the total probability $P_{\\text{ligatable}}$ is the product of these two compound probabilities due to the independence assumption:\n$$P_{\\text{ligatable}} = (p_{3'\\text{-OH}})^{2} \\times (p_{5'\\text{-P}})^{2}$$\nSubstituting the calculated probabilities:\n$$P_{\\text{ligatable}} = (0.6)^{2} \\times (0.75)^{2}$$\n$$P_{\\text{ligatable}} = 0.36 \\times 0.5625$$\nTo compute this product, we can use fractional representation for precision:\n$$p_{3'\\text{-OH}} = 0.6 = \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5}$$\n$$p_{5'\\text{-P}} = 0.75 = \\frac{3}{4}$$\nThus,\n$$P_{\\text{ligatable}} = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^{2} \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{9}{25} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{81}{400}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$$P_{\\text{ligatable}} = \\frac{81}{400} = \\frac{20.25}{100} = 0.2025$$\nThis is the fraction of DSBs that are immediately ligatable.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2025}$$", "id": "2957219"}, {"introduction": "Following the creation of a double-strand break, a cell faces a critical decision: which repair pathway to engage?

Since $0.7692 > 0.07692$, Ku binding to DNA ends is dominant under these conditions.\n\nThe reason for this dominance lies in the relative binding affinities, which are inversely related to the dissociation constants. The fractional occupancy of a site by a given protein is proportional to the ratio of its concentration to its $K_d$. Although the total concentrations of Ku and MRN are equal ($[\\mathrm{Ku}]_T = [\\mathrm{MRN}]_T = 5 \\ \\mathrm{nM}$), their affinities for the DNA end are not. Ku has a dissociation constant $K_d^{\\mathrm{Ku}} = 1 \\ \\mathrm{nM}$, while MRN has a dissociation constant $K_d^{\\mathrm{MRN}} = 10 \\ \\mathrm{nM}$. A lower $K_d$ signifies a higher binding affinity. Thus, Ku has a $10$-fold higher affinity for the DNA end than MRN. This higher affinity directly translates into a higher probability of occupying the binding site at equilibrium, causing it to outcompete MRN for binding, even at equal concentrations. The ratio of bound Ku to bound MRN at equilibrium is $\\frac{[D\\mathrm{Ku}]}{[D\\mathrm{MRN}]} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ku}]/K_d^{\\mathrm{Ku}}}{[\\mathrm{MRN}]/K_d^{\\mathrm{MRN}}} = \\frac{5}{0.5} = 10$, meaning for every one DNA end bound by MRN, ten are bound by Ku.

It describes a canonical scenario in molecular and cell biology concerning DNA damage and repair. The described DNA end structures ($3'$-PG, single-strand overhang) are known consequences of ionizing radiation. The specified enzymes (Ku, DNA-PKcs, Artemis, PNKP, Ligase IV complex) constitute the core machinery of the c-NHEJ pathway. The biochemical requirement for ligation ($3'$-OH and $5'$-P) is a fundamental principle of nucleic acid enzymology. The constraints are clearly defined, and the problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. The terminology is precise and standard. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Derivation of Solution**\nThe goal is to process End-$\\mathcal{A}$ and End-$\\mathcal{B}$ into a state where they can be joined by the DNA Ligase IV complex. This requires that at the junction, one end provides a $3'$-OH group and the other provides a $5'$-P group.\n\n1.  **Analysis of End-$\\mathcal{A}$:** This end has a $3'$-PG, which is a covalent modification that blocks the $3'$ terminus. This is not a $3'$-OH, and thus End-$\\mathcal{A}$ is not a substrate for DNA Ligase IV. The $3'$-PG must be removed. The enzyme polynucleotide kinase phosphatase (PNKP) possesses a $3'$-phosphatase activity that is known to efficiently remove both $3'$-phosphates and $3'$-phosphoglycolates, generating a clean $3'$-OH terminus. This processing step is mandatory.\n\n2.  **Analysis of End-$\\mathcal{B}$:** This end has a $1$ nt $5'$ overhang. The problem states there is no microhomology, so this overhang cannot be used to guide annealing. For ligation to the other end (which after processing of its $3'$-PG, we can consider blunt), this overhang must be dealt with. The two main possibilities are fill-in synthesis or removal of the overhang. Fill-in synthesis requires a template strand, which is absent for a $5'$ overhang. Therefore, the only viable option that minimizes complexity is to remove the overhang. The nuclease Artemis, when complexed with and activated by DNA-PKcs, has $5' \\to 3'$ exonuclease activity capable of trimming such overhangs to create a blunt end. According to the problem's assumptions, this cleavage will generate a new terminus with the required $5'$-P and $3'$-OH groups. This processing step is also mandatory.\n\n3.  **Synthesis of the Pathway:** For successful repair via c-NHEJ under the given conditions, two key enzymatic events must precede ligation:\n    a. PNKP must act on End-$\\mathcal{A}$ to convert the $3'$-PG to a $3'$-OH.\n    b. Artemis must act on End-$\\mathcal{B}$ to remove the $1$ nt $5'$ overhang, creating a blunt end.\n\n    After both ends are processed to become blunt and possess compatible termini ($3'$-OH and $5'$-P), the DNA Ligase IV–XRCC4–XLF complex can ligate them together. The entire process is orchestrated within a synaptic complex formed by Ku and DNA-PKcs. The processing of End-$\\mathcal{A}$ and End-$\\mathcal{B}$ are independent events that can occur in any temporal order or concurrently. Both sequences of events constitute a minimal and correct pathway.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. PNKP phosphatase converts the $3'$-PG at End-$\\mathcal{A}$ to a $3'$-hydroxyl; Artemis trims the single-nucleotide $5'$ overhang at End-$\\mathcal{B}$ to produce a blunt end; DNA Ligase IV–XRCC4–XLF executes ligation.**\nThis option correctly identifies the necessary processing steps for both ends and the enzymes responsible. PNKP phosphatase activity is correctly assigned to the removal of the $3'$-PG. Artemis activity is correctly assigned to the removal of the $5'$ overhang. The final ligation step is performed by the correct c-NHEJ ligase complex. The sequence of events is biochemically and biologically plausible. The pathway is minimal and adheres to all constraints.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Artemis removes the single-nucleotide $5'$ overhang at End-$\\mathcal{B}$ to a blunt end; PNKP phosphatase converts the $3'$-PG at End-$\\mathcal{A}$ to a $3'$-hydroxyl; DNA Ligase IV–XRCC4–XLF executes ligation.**\nThis option describes the same set of necessary enzymatic activities as option A, but in a different order. As the processing of the two distinct DNA ends can occur independently within the synaptic complex before ligation, this order is equally plausible and valid. It leads to the same outcome: two compatible blunt ends that are substrates for ligation. This pathway is also minimal and adheres to all constraints.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Artemis trims the $1$ nt $5'$ overhang at End-$\\mathcal{B}$ to blunt and DNA Ligase IV–XRCC4–XLF ligates; the $3'$-PG at End-$\\mathcal{A}$ is left unprocessed because it is distal to the ligation junction.**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. Ligation requires a $3'$-OH. The $3'$-PG at End-$\\mathcal{A}$ is not \"distal\" to the junction; it is precisely at the terminus that must be ligated. Leaving it unprocessed makes ligation impossible. Furthermore, this option violates the problem's requirement to include PNKP in the pathway.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. PNKP kinase phosphorylates the $5'$ terminus of the $1$ nt overhang at End-$\\mathcal{B}$; DNA Ligase IV–XRCC4–XLF ligates without further processing because a $5'$-phosphate is now present; the $3'$-PG at End-$\\mathcal{A}$ will be removed later by processing during gap filling.**\nThis option contains multiple errors. First, the problem states to assume pre-existing $5'$ termini already have phosphates, making PNKP kinase activity unnecessary and violating the minimality constraint. Second, it incorrectly proposes ligation can occur without processing the $3'$-PG on End-$\\mathcal{A}$. Ligation cannot precede the creation of a valid substrate. Third, it fails to resolve the structural mismatch between a blunt end and an overhang. Finally, it omits the required activity of Artemis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E.

The use of DNA Ligase III–XRCC1 is characteristic of alternative-NHEJ or single-strand break repair, not c-NHEJ which uses DNA Ligase IV. This option also violates the explicit instruction to include Artemis in the processing path.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBoth options A and B describe valid and minimal pathways that satisfy all conditions of the problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "2957239"}]}
