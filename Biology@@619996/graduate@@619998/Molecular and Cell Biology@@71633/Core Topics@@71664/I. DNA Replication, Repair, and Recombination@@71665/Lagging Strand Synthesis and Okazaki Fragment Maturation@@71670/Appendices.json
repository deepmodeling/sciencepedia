It is scientifically sound, self-contained, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe solution requires two deductions: the location of the RNA primer on an Okazaki fragment and the polarity of strand displacement during maturation.\n\n**1. Position of the RNA Primer**\n\nThe problem states that the replication fork moves to the right, and the lagging-strand template has $5'\\to 3'$ polarity running into the fork. The geometry is as follows:\n$$\n\\text{Fork progression} \\rightarrow \\\\\n\\text{Leading Template: } 3'-\\text{-------------------------}-5' \\\\\n\\text{Lagging Template: } 5'-\\text{-------------------------}-3'\n$$\n\nAccording to fact (iii), the daughter strand must be antiparallel to its template. Therefore, the Okazaki fragments synthesized on the lagging template must have an overall $3'\\to 5'$ polarity with respect to the template strand.\n$$\n\\text{Lagging Template: } 5'-\\text{-------------------------}-3' \\\\\n\\text{Okazaki Fragment: } 3'-\\text{-------------------------}-5'\n$$\n\nFact (i) dictates that DNA polymerases synthesize DNA in the $5'\\to 3'$ direction. This means synthesis on the lagging strand must proceed away from the replication fork (to the left, in this diagram), which is consistent with the problem statement (\"synthesized in a direction overall opposite to fork movement\").\n$$\n\\text{Lagging Template: } 5'-\\text{-------------------------}-3' \\\\\n\\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\leftarrow \\text{Direction of synthesis} \\\\\n\\text{Okazaki Fragment: } 3'-\\text{------------}-5'\n$$\n\nFact (i) also states that polymerases require a preexisting $3'$-OH group to initiate synthesis. Fact (ii) provides that this is supplied by a short RNA primer. Thus, to begin synthesis of an Okazaki fragment, primase must first create an RNA primer. The DNA polymerase then extends from the $3'$-OH end of this primer. As the polymerase moves, it creates a new strand in the $5'\\to 3'$ direction. Consequently, the RNA primer must be located at the very beginning of the synthesized strand, which is its $5'$ end.\n$$\n\\text{Lagging Template: } 5'-\\text{-------------------------}-3' \\\\\n\\text{Okazaki Fragment: } 3'-\\text{(DNA segment)}-\\text{[RNA primer]}-5'\n$$\n\nTherefore, the RNA primer is located at the $5'$ end of each Okazaki fragment.\n\n**2. Polarity of Strand Displacement during Maturation**\n\nMaturation involves joining an \"upstream\" fragment to a \"downstream\" one. Based on the definitions and the direction of synthesis, the upstream fragment is the one synthesized earlier and is farther from the fork.\n$$\n\\text{Fork} \\rightarrow \\\\\n\\text{Lagging Template: } 5'-\\text{---(Upstream)---(Downstream)---}-3' \\\\\n\\text{Upstream Fragment: } \\quad 3'-\\text{DNA}_{\\text{up}}-\\text{[RNA}_{\\text{up}}]-5' \\\\\n\\text{Downstream Fragment: } \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad 3'-\\text{DNA}_{\\text{down}}-\\text{[RNA}_{\\text{down}}]-5'\n$$\n\nFact (iv) states that maturation occurs when \"a DNA polymerase extend[s] the upstream DNA into the downstream primer\". The DNA polymerase binds to the $3'$-OH end of the DNA portion of the upstream fragment and begins synthesis, moving toward the downstream fragment.\n$$\n\\text{Upstream Fragment Extension:} \\quad 3'-\\text{DNA}_{\\text{up}} \\rightarrow \\text{synthesis continues into space of downstream primer}\n$$\n\nAs the polymerase synthesizes new DNA, it encounters the $5'$ end of the downstream Okazaki fragment (which is the RNA primer). The polymerase displaces this strand. The displacement process, therefore, begins at the $5'$ end of the downstream fragment and proceeds along that fragment toward its $3'$ end. This creates a single-stranded flap of RNA (and potentially some DNA) that has a free $5'$ end, known as a $5'$ flap.\n$$\n\\text{Displacement process:} \\\\\n\\dots\\text{DNA}_{\\text{up}}\\text{ (extending)} \\rightarrow \\quad \\text{displaced flap } \\uparrow \\\\\n3'-\\text{DNA}_{\\text{template}}-\\dots \\qquad \\quad [\\text{RNA}_{\\text{down}}]-5' \\leftarrow \\text{downstream fragment being peeled} \\\\\n$$\n\nThe direction of displacement relative to the downstream fragment is from its $5'$ end toward its $3'$ end.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivations**\n1.

Its language is objective and precise. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe first task is to derive an expression for the total number of Okazaki fragments, $N$, required for the synthesis of the lagging-strand portion of a haploid genome of size $G$. The problem defines $L$ as the average length of a single Okazaki fragment. It also provides the crucial premise that the total length of DNA synthesized on the lagging strand across the entire genome is equal to the genome size, $G$.\n\nIf we have $N$ Okazaki fragments, each with an average length of $L$, the total length they collectively constitute is the product $N \\times L$. By equating this to the total length of lagging-strand synthesis given, we arrive at the fundamental relationship:\n$$G = N \\times L$$\nSolving for the number of fragments $N$ gives the expression derived from first principles:\n$$N = \\frac{G}{L}$$\nThis expression is general for any organism under the stated model assumptions.\n\nThe second task is to compute the ratio $\\mathcal{R}$ of total ligation events. The problem states that each Okazaki fragment maturation consumes exactly one ligation event. Therefore, the total number of ligation events is equal to the total number of Okazaki fragments, $N$. The ratio $\\mathcal{R}$ is defined as the number of ligation events in budding yeast, $N_{\\mathrm{Sc}}$, to the number of ligation events in E. coli, $N_{\\mathrm{Ec}}$.\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{Sc}}}{N_{\\mathrm{Ec}}}$$\nUsing the derived expression $N = G/L$ for each organism, we can write:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{Sc}} = \\frac{G_{\\mathrm{Sc}}}{L_{\\mathrm{Sc}}}$$\n$$N_{\\mathrm{Ec}} = \\frac{G_{\\mathrm{Ec}}}{L_{\\mathrm{Ec}}}$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for the ratio $\\mathcal{R}$:\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{G_{\\mathrm{Sc}}}{L_{\\mathrm{Sc}}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{G_{\\mathrm{Ec}}}{L_{\\mathrm{Ec}}}\\right)} = \\frac{G_{\\mathrm{Sc}}}{L_{\\mathrm{Sc}}} \\cdot \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{Ec}}}{G_{\\mathrm{Ec}}}$$\nNow we must substitute the given values.

It is a rigorous exercise in applying queueing theory and probability to a biophysical system. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe system described is a classic M/M/1 queue. Flaps arrive with a Poisson rate $\\lambda$, are served by a single server (FEN1) at an exponential rate $\\mu$. The traffic intensity (or server utilization) is given by $\\rho = \\lambda/\\mu$.

The process of misalignment, which occurs with a constant hazard rate $k_{m}$. The time to this event, $T_{\\text{misalign}}$, is an exponentially distributed random variable with rate $k_{m}$. Its probability density function is $f_{T_{\\text{misalign}}}(t) = k_{m}\\exp(-k_{m}t)$.\n\nA deletion occurs if the misalignment event happens before the flap is resolved, i.e., if $T_{\\text{misalign}} < T_{\\text{sys}}$. We need to compute $P(T_{\\text{misalign}} < T_{\\text{sys}})$. This requires the probability distribution of $T_{\\text{sys}}$.\n\nFor a stable M/M/1 queue with arrival rate $\\lambda$ and service rate $\\mu$, the total time a customer (a flap, in this case) spends in the system, $T_{\\text{sys}}$, is known to be exponentially distributed with a rate of $(\\mu - \\lambda)$. The probability density function is $f_{T_{\\text{sys}}}(t) = (\\mu - \\lambda)\\exp(-(\\mu - \\lambda)t)$.\n\nWe have two independent, competing exponential processes: misalignment with rate $k_{m}$ and system departure (resolution) with rate $\\mu - \\lambda$. The probability that the misalignment event occurs first is given by the ratio of its rate to the sum of the rates of the two competing processes:\n$$ P_{\\text{misalign}} = P(T_{\\text{misalign}}  T_{\\text{sys}}) = \\frac{k_{m}}{k_{m} + (\\mu - \\lambda)} = \\frac{k_{m}}{k_{m} + \\mu - \\lambda} $$\nThis probability depends on the flap arrival rate $\\lambda$ because $\\lambda$ influences the congestion of the system and, consequently, the average time a flap must wait for processing.\n\nNow, we can write the full expression for the steady-state deletion rate as a function of $\\lambda$:\n$$ R_{\\text{del}}(\\lambda) = \\lambda \\times \\frac{k_{m}}{k_{m} + \\mu - \\lambda} $$\n\nWe can now calculate the deletion rate for the two specified conditions.\n\n**Initial Condition:**\nThe arrival rate is $\\lambda = \\lambda_{0}$.
