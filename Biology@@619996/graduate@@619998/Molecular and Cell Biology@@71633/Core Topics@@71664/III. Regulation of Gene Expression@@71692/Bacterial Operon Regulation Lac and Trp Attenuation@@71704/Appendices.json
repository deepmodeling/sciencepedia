{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Before we can build quantitative models, we must first master the logical architecture of gene regulation. This exercise revisits the classic genetic experiments of François Jacob and Jacques Monod, which used cleverly designed mutants and partial diploid cells (merodiploids) to deconstruct the `lac` operon. By predicting the phenotypes of strains with $lacI^s$ (superrepressor) and $lacO^c$ (operator constitutive) alleles, you will solidify your understanding of fundamental concepts like cis- and trans-acting elements, dominance, and epistasis, which form the bedrock of molecular genetics [@problem_id:2934108].", "problem": "A core model for gene regulation in bacteria combines the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology (DNA is transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA), which is translated to protein) with the concepts of cis-acting DNA sequences and trans-acting regulatory proteins. In the lactose (lac) system of Escherichia coli (E. coli), transcription by RNA polymerase (RNAP) from the lac promoter is negatively regulated by the Lac repressor protein, which is encoded by the lacI gene. The repressor binds specific operator DNA sequences adjacent to the promoter, sterically and energetically antagonizing RNAP binding and productive initiation. Allosteric binding of an inducer such as allolactose or the gratuitous inducer isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) shifts the conformational equilibrium of the repressor toward a state with reduced affinity for operator DNA, thereby permitting transcription.\n\nMutations can alter either the trans-acting repressor or the cis-acting operator. For example, repressor variants can change their inducer responsiveness without abolishing DNA binding, and operator variants can reduce repressor binding affinity without changing the protein. Because the repressor protein diffuses, repressor alleles exhibit dominance in trans across operon copies within the same cell, whereas operator alleles affect only the linked operon in cis.\n\nConsider the following genotypes and environmental conditions, each evaluated for expression of the lacZ structural gene (β-galactosidase) as the readout of lac operon transcription:\n\n- Haploid strain A: $lacI^s\\ lacO^+\\ lacZ^+$.\n- Haploid strain B: $lacI^+\\ lacO^c\\ lacZ^+$.\n- Haploid strain C: $lacI^s\\ lacO^c\\ lacZ^+$.\n- Merodiploid strain D (partial diploid carrying an $F'$ episome with a second lac region): chromosomal copy $lacI^s\\ lacO^+\\ lacZ^+$; episomal copy $lacI^+\\ lacO^c\\ lacZ^+$; the cell has a single cytoplasm in which repressor proteins can diffuse.\n\nEach strain is tested in the absence of inducer and in the presence of saturating IPTG. Assume that $lacI^s$ repressor, if bound to an operator, will not dissociate in response to IPTG, and that $lacO^c$ operator, if mutated, cannot be bound by any repressor variant. Assume also that transcription from $lacO^+$ requires relief of repression by repressor dissociation and that $lacO^c$ does not alter RNAP’s intrinsic ability to initiate when unimpeded by repressor.\n\nWhich option correctly defines and distinguishes the $lacI^s$ (superrepressor) and $lacO^c$ (operator constitutive) alleles, and correctly states their epistatic relationship for lac expression in the presence and absence of inducer across the strains above?\n\nA. $lacI^s$ encodes a repressor that cannot bind operator DNA, making it recessive; $lacO^c$ encodes a diffusible activator that acts in trans. Therefore, strain A is inducible by IPTG, strain B is inducible only in the presence of IPTG, strain C is off without IPTG and on with IPTG, and in strain D both copies are off without IPTG but both become on with IPTG. $lacI^s$ is epistatic to $lacO^c$ because repressors dominate over operators.\n\nB. $lacI^s$ encodes a repressor that binds operator DNA but cannot bind inducer, making it dominant in trans over $lacI^+$; $lacO^c$ is a cis-acting operator allele that reduces or abolishes repressor binding to the linked operon. Therefore, strain A is off without IPTG and remains off with IPTG (uninducible), strain B is on without IPTG and remains on with IPTG (constitutive), strain C is on without IPTG and remains on with IPTG (constitutive), and in strain D the $lacO^c$-linked $lacZ^+$ is on in both conditions while the $lacO^+$-linked $lacZ^+$ is off in both conditions; for the linked operon, $lacO^c$ is epistatic to $lacI^s$ in both absence and presence of inducer.\n\nC. $lacI^s$ encodes a repressor that binds inducer too tightly and thus dissociates from operator even without IPTG; $lacO^c$ strengthens repressor binding and acts only in cis. Therefore, strain A is on without IPTG and off with IPTG, strain B is off in both conditions, strain C is off without IPTG and off with IPTG, and in strain D both copies are off regardless of IPTG. $lacO^c$ is recessive to $lacI^s$ because operator sequences do not determine expression.\n\nD. $lacI^s$ encodes a repressor that cannot bind inducer and remains operator-bound; $lacO^c$ is cis-acting and prevents repressor binding to its operator. However, high concentrations of IPTG titrate $lacI^s$ away. Therefore, strain A is off without IPTG but on with IPTG, strain B is on without IPTG and remains on with IPTG, strain C is off without IPTG but on with IPTG, and in strain D both copies are off without IPTG but both become on with IPTG. $lacI^s$ is epistatic to $lacO^c$ in the absence of IPTG, but IPTG reverses this epistasis.", "solution": "The problem statement must first be validated for scientific soundness, self-consistency, and clarity before a solution is attempted.\n\n**Step 1: Extraction of Givens**\n- **System**: Bacterial gene regulation, specifically the lactose (*lac*) operon of *Escherichia coli*.\n- **Core Principle**: DNA $\\rightarrow$ mRNA $\\rightarrow$ Protein.

Produces a repressor protein that, once bound to an operator, will not dissociate in response to IPTG.\n    - $lacO^+$: Wild-type operator sequence. Can be bound by repressor. Transcription from $lacO^+$ requires repressor dissociation.\n    - $lacO^c$: Operator constitutive allele. A mutated operator that cannot be bound by any repressor variant.

The alleles described ($lacI^s$, $lacO^c$) are classic mutations used to elucidate this model. The problem is well-posed; it provides a set of genotypes and explicit, non-contradictory assumptions about allele function. The question is objective and requires a logical deduction of phenotypes and genetic interactions based on the provided framework. No scientific flaws, ambiguities, or contradictions are present in the problem setup.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. A solution can be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Phenotypes and Genetic Relationships**\n\nWe will analyze the expression of the $lacZ^+$ gene for each strain in the absence ($-$IPTG) and presence ($+$IPTG) of the inducer. Expression is \"on\" if transcription occurs and \"off\" if it is blocked.\n\n1.  **Strain A: $lacI^s\\ lacO^+\\ lacZ^+$**\n    - The cell produces the superrepressor protein ($lacI^s$), which binds to the wild-type operator ($lacO^+$).\n    - **Condition ($-$IPTG)**: The $lacI^s$ repressor binds to $lacO^+$, blocking RNAP. Transcription is **off**.\n    - **Condition ($+$IPTG)**: The $lacI^s$ repressor cannot bind IPTG and remains bound to $lacO^+$. Transcription remains **off**.\n    - **Phenotype**: Uninducible (always off).\n\n2.  **Strain B: $lacI^+\\ lacO^c\\ lacZ^+$**\n    - The cell produces wild-type repressor ($lacI^+$).\n    - The operator is constitutive ($lacO^c$), meaning it cannot be bound by any repressor.\n    - **Condition ($-$IPTG)**: Although active $lacI^+$ repressor is present, it cannot bind to the $lacO^c$ operator. RNAP is not blocked. Transcription is **on**.\n    - **Condition ($+$IPTG)**: The presence of inducer is irrelevant as the operator is already unable to bind repressor. Transcription remains **on**.\n    - **Phenotype**: Constitutive (always on).\n\n3.  **Strain C: $lacI^s\\ lacO^c\\ lacZ^+$**\n    - The cell produces superrepressor ($lacI^s$).\n    - The operator is constitutive ($lacO^c$) and cannot be bound by the $lacI^s$ repressor.\n    - **Condition ($-$IPTG)**: The $lacI^s$ repressor cannot bind to the $lacO^c$ operator. RNAP is not blocked. Transcription is **on**.\n    - **Condition ($+$IPTG)**: The situation is unchanged. Repressor cannot bind the operator. Transcription remains **on**.\n    - **Phenotype**: Constitutive (always on).\n    - **Epistasis**: This strain contains an allele for an \"always off\" phenotype ($lacI^s$) and an allele for an \"always on\" phenotype ($lacO^c$). The resulting phenotype is \"always on.\" This demonstrates that the $lacO^c$ mutation is epistatic to the $lacI^s$ mutation because the operator mutation prevents the repressor protein from exerting its effect on the linked operon. This is a classic example where a *cis*-acting element's function dictates the outcome over a *trans*-acting factor.\n\n4.  **Strain D: Merodiploid $lacI^s\\ lacO^+\\ lacZ^+ / F' lacI^+\\ lacO^c\\ lacZ^+$**\n    - This cell contains two sets of *lac* genes and produces two types of repressor proteins: $lacI^s$ (superrepressor) and $lacI^+$ (wild-type). Both proteins are diffusible (*trans*-acting). We analyze each operon separately.\n    - **Chromosomal operon ($lacO^+\\ lacZ^+$)**: This operon has a wild-type operator, $lacO^+$. In the cytoplasm, both $lacI^s$ and $lacI^+$ repressors are present. The $lacI^s$ protein is dominant over $lacI^+$ because it will remain bound to $lacO^+$ even if IPTG causes $lacI^+$ to dissociate. Therefore, the $lacO^+$ operator will always be occupied by the $lacI^s$ protein. Transcription is **off** under both ($-$IPTG) and ($+$IPTG) conditions.\n    - **Episomal operon ($lacO^c\\ lacZ^+$)**: This operon has a constitutive operator, $lacO^c$. By definition, this operator cannot be bound by *either* the $lacI^s$ or the $lacI^+$ repressor. Thus, RNAP is never blocked from this operon. Transcription is **on** under both ($-$IPTG) and ($+$IPTG) conditions.\n    - **Overall Phenotype**: Expression is measured for the entire cell. The chromosomal $lacZ^+$ is always off. The episomal $lacZ^+$ is always on. The cell will therefore produce $\\beta$-galactosidase constitutively from the episomal copy.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n-   **Option A**: States that $lacI^s$ cannot bind operator DNA and that $lacO^c$ encodes a diffusible activator. Both statements are fundamentally incorrect. The descriptions of $lacI^s$ and $lacO^c$ are wrong. The resulting phenotype predictions are consequently incorrect. For example, it predicts strain A is inducible, whereas it is uninducible. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **Option B**:\n    - Defines $lacI^s$ as a repressor that binds the operator but not the inducer, making it dominant in *trans*. **Correct**.\n    - Defines $lacO^c$ as a *cis*-acting operator that abolishes repressor binding. **Correct**.\n    - Predicts strain A is off/off (uninducible). **Correct**.\n    - Predicts strain B is on/on (constitutive). **Correct**.\n    - Predicts strain C is on/on (constitutive). **Correct**.\n    - Predicts that in strain D, the $lacO^c$-linked gene is on/on while the $lacO^+$-linked gene is off/off. **Correct**.\n    - States that for the linked operon, $lacO^c$ is epistatic to $lacI^s$. As demonstrated in the analysis of Strain C, this is **Correct**.\n    - All parts of this option are consistent with the principles of molecular biology and the logical deductions from the problem statement. **Correct**.\n\n-   **Option C**: States that $lacI^s$ binds inducer too tightly and that $lacO^c$ strengthens repressor binding. Both definitions are the opposite of the correct functions and contradict the problem statement's assumptions. The phenotype predictions are therefore invalid. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **Option D**: Correctly defines the basic functions of $lacI^s$ and $lacO^c$. However, it introduces a new assumption that \"high concentrations of IPTG titrate $lacI^s$ away.\" This directly contradicts the explicit premise of the problem: \"$lacI^s$ repressor, if bound to an operator, will not dissociate in response to IPTG.\" The subsequent predictions, such as strain A being inducible by IPTG, are based on this false premise and are therefore incorrect according to the rules of the problem. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2934108"}, {"introduction": "Qualitative logic can be powerfully formalized using the principles of equilibrium statistical mechanics.

The promoter has three sites: an RNAP site that overlaps an operator for LacI such that RNAP and LacI cannot occupy the promoter simultaneously, and a CRP site that can be occupied concurrently with either RNAP or LacI. When CRP and RNAP are bound simultaneously, they engage in a favorable cooperative interaction that lowers the total energy of the complex by an amount $\\Delta \\epsilon_{AP}$ relative to the non-interacting case. There is no direct interaction between CRP and LacI beyond independent binding to Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA).

It is a standard, non-trivial problem in biophysical modeling.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe state of the promoter is defined by the set of bound proteins. We denote a microstate by the triplet of occupancies $(n_P, n_R, n_A)$, where $n_X \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ for $X \\in \\{P, R, A\\}$. The mutual exclusion of RNAP ($P$) and LacI ($R$) imposes the constraint $n_P n_R = 0$.\n\nThe valid microstates and their corresponding statistical weights are determined using the grand canonical ensemble. The statistical weight of the empty promoter state $(0,0,0)$ is taken as the reference, $W_{000} = 1$. The weight of any other state is the product of the activities ($c_X/K_X$) for each bound protein, multiplied by any relevant interaction factors.\n\nLet the activities be denoted as $x_P = c_P/K_P$, $x_R = c_R/K_R$, and $x_A = c_A/K_A$. The possible states and their weights are:\n1.  Empty promoter: state $(0,0,0)$, weight $W_1 = 1$.\n2.  RNAP bound alone: state $(1,0,0)$, weight $W_2 = \\frac{c_P}{K_P}$.\n3.  LacI bound alone: state $(0,1,0)$, weight $W_3 = \\frac{c_R}{K_R}$.\n4.  CRP bound alone: state $(0,0,1)$, weight $W_4 = \\frac{c_A}{K_A}$.\n5.  RNAP and CRP bound (cooperative): state $(1,0,1)$, weight $W_5 = \\frac{c_P}{K_P} \\frac{c_A}{K_A} \\omega_{AP}$.\n6.  LacI and CRP bound (non-cooperative): state $(0,1,1)$, weight $W_6 = \\frac{c_R}{K_R} \\frac{c_A}{K_A}$.\nThe state with both RNAP and LacI bound, $(1,1, \\cdot)$, is forbidden.\n\n**1. Partition Function of the Regulated Promoter ($Z$)**\nThe grand canonical partition function is the sum of the statistical weights of all possible microstates.\n$$Z = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} W_i = 1 + \\frac{c_P}{K_P} + \\frac{c_R}{K_R} + \\frac{c_A}{K_A} + \\frac{c_P}{K_P} \\frac{c_A}{K_A} \\omega_{AP} + \\frac{c_R}{K_R} \\frac{c_A}{K_A}$$\nThis expression can be rearranged and factored for clarity:\n$$Z = (1 + \\frac{c_R}{K_R})(1 + \\frac{c_A}{K_A}) + \\frac{c_P}{K_P}(1 + \\frac{c_A}{K_A}\\omega_{AP})$$\n\n**2. RNAP Occupancy Probabilities ($p_{\\text{on}}$ and $p_{\\text{on}}^{(0)}$)**\nThe probability of a specific configuration is its weight divided by the partition function $Z$. According to the occupancy hypothesis, the promoter is transcriptionally active when RNAP is bound. This corresponds to states $(1,0,0)$ and $(1,0,1)$.\nThe probability of RNAP occupancy, $p_{\\text{on}}$, is the sum of the probabilities of these two states:\n$$p_{\\text{on}} = P(n_P=1) = \\frac{W_2 + W_5}{Z} = \\frac{\\frac{c_P}{K_P} + \\frac{c_P}{K_P} \\frac{c_A}{K_A} \\omega_{AP}}{Z}$$\nFactoring the numerator gives:\n$$p_{\\text{on}} = \\frac{\\frac{c_P}{K_P} (1 + \\frac{c_A}{K_A} \\omega_{AP})}{(1 + \\frac{c_R}{K_R})(1 + \\frac{c_A}{K_A}) + \\frac{c_P}{K_P}(1 + \\frac{c_A}{K_A}\\omega_{AP})}$$\n\nFor the basal promoter, only the RNAP site is available. This is equivalent to setting the concentrations of the other regulators to zero ($c_R=0$, $c_A=0$). The system has only two states: empty (weight $1$) and RNAP-bound (weight $c_P/K_P$).\nThe partition function for the basal promoter is $Z^{(0)} = 1 + \\frac{c_P}{K_P}$.\nThe basal RNAP occupancy probability, $p_{\\text{on}}^{(0)}$, is:\n$$p_{\\text{on}}^{(0)} = \\frac{\\frac{c_P}{K_P}}{Z^{(0)}} = \\frac{\\frac{c_P}{K_P}}{1 + \\frac{c_P}{K_P}}$$\n\n**3. Fold-Change ($\\text{FC}$)**\nThe fold-change is defined as the ratio $\\text{FC} = p_{\\text{on}} / p_{\\text{on}}^{(0)}$.\n$$\\text{FC} = \\frac{\\frac{\\frac{c_P}{K_P} (1 + \\frac{c_A}{K_A} \\omega_{AP})}{(1 + \\frac{c_R}{K_R})(1 + \\frac{c_A}{K_A}) + \\frac{c_P}{K_P}(1 + \\frac{c_A}{K_A}\\omega_{AP})}}{\\frac{\\frac{c_P}{K_P}}{1 + \\frac{c_P}{K_P}}}$$\nThe term $\\frac{c_P}{K_P}$ in the numerators of the main fraction cancels out.\n$$\\text{FC} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{c_A}{K_A} \\omega_{AP}}{(1 + \\frac{c_R}{K_R})(1 + \\frac{c_A}{K_A}) + \\frac{c_P}{K_P}(1 + \\frac{c_A}{K_A}\\omega_{AP})} \\times (1 + \\frac{c_P}{K_P})$$\nThis gives the final expression for the fold-change:\n$$\\text{FC} = \\frac{(1 + \\frac{c_P}{K_P})(1 + \\frac{c_A}{K_A} \\omega_{AP})}{(1 + \\frac{c_R}{K_R})(1 + \\frac{c_A}{K_A}) + \\frac{c_P}{K_P}(1 + \\frac{c_A}{K_A}\\omega_{AP})}$$\nFinally, we substitute the definitions of the concentrations $c_X = N_X/V$ for $X \\in \\{P, R, A\\}$ as requested, to obtain the expression in terms of molecule numbers, volume, dissociation constants, and the interaction factor.\n$$\\text{FC} = \\frac{(1 + \\frac{N_P}{V K_P})(1 + \\frac{N_A}{V K_A} \\omega_{AP})}{(1 + \\frac{N_R}{V K_R})(1 + \\frac{N_A}{V K_A}) + \\frac{N_P}{V K_P}(1 + \\frac{N_A}{V K_A}\\omega_{AP})}$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the fold-change in gene expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\left(1 + \\frac{N_P}{V K_P}\\right)\\left(1 + \\frac{N_A}{V K_A} \\omega_{AP}\\right)}{\\left(1 + \\frac{N_R}{V K_R}\\right)\\left(1 + \\frac{N_A}{V K_A}\\right) + \\frac{N_P}{V K_P}\\left(1 + \\frac{N_A}{V K_A}\\omega_{AP}\\right)}}$$", "id": "2934129"}, {"introduction": "Bacterial regulation extends beyond protein-DNA interactions, embracing sophisticated mechanisms based on RNA physics.

In the trp leader, the amino acid sequence of the short leader peptide encoded by region $1$ can be preserved while silently changing messenger RNA (mRNA) nucleotides (synonymous mutations). Such synonymous changes can alter RNA pairing propensities and thereby change the stability of the region $2$–$3$ antiterminator hairpin without altering the peptide sequence.\n\nAssume the following well-tested physical and biochemical facts:\n- Transcription and translation are coupled in bacteria, and ribosome stalling at the tryptophan codons in region $1$ exposes region $2$, enabling it to pair with region $3$ and form the $2$–$3$ antiterminator hairpin, thereby precluding formation of the $3$–$4$ terminator hairpin.\n- The Gibbs free energy change of hairpin formation, $\\Delta G$, at a fixed temperature can be approximated as the sum of stabilizing base-pair contributions and a destabilizing loop penalty. Use the additive contributions listed below and ignore end effects, mismatches, and dangling ends for this problem.\n\nUse these per-interaction contributions at $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$:\n- Each $\\mathrm{G}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{C}$ pair contributes $\\,-3.4\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n- Each $\\mathrm{A}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{U}$ pair contributes $\\,-2.1\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n- Each $\\mathrm{G}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{U}$ wobble pair contributes $\\,-0.9\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n- A $5$-nucleotide hairpin loop contributes a penalty of $+5.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n\nConsider the wild-type region $2$–$3$ antiterminator hairpin with a $6$-base-pair stem and a $5$-nucleotide loop. The $6$ stem pairs (from base-pair $1$ to base-pair $6$) in the wild-type are:\n- $\\mathrm{G}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{C}$, $\\mathrm{G}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{C}$, $\\mathrm{A}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{U}$, $\\mathrm{G}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{C}$, $\\mathrm{A}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{U}$, $\\mathrm{G}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{U}$.\n\nA synonymous mutant that preserves the leader peptide amino acid sequence alters the mRNA such that the $2$–$3$ stem pairs become:\n- $\\mathrm{G}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{C}$, $\\mathrm{G}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{U}$, $\\mathrm{A}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{U}$, $\\mathrm{G}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{U}$, $\\mathrm{A}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{U}$, $\\mathrm{G}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{U}$.\n\nBoth wild-type and mutant have the same $5$-nucleotide loop.\n\nTask:\n1. Using the stated assumptions and contributions, explain mechanistically how these synonymous mutations can disrupt attenuation even though the leader peptide amino acid sequence is unchanged.\n2. Compute the change in antiterminator stability due to the synonymous mutations, defined as $\\Delta\\Delta G \\equiv \\Delta G_{\\text{mut}} - \\Delta G_{\\text{wt}}$ for the $2$–$3$ hairpin at $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. Round your final numerical result to three significant figures. Express the final value in $\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.", "solution": "The phenomenon described in the problem, where synonymous mutations disrupt `trp` operon attenuation, is explained by the principles of Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) thermodynamics and its role in gene regulation. The attenuation mechanism functions as a molecular switch, the state of which is determined by a kinetic competition between the formation of two mutually exclusive secondary structures in the leader mRNA: the region $2$–$3$ antiterminator hairpin and the region $3$–$4$ intrinsic terminator hairpin.\n\nUnder conditions of tryptophan starvation, the ribosome translating the leader peptide stalls at tandem tryptophan codons within region $1$. This physical obstruction of region $1$ liberates region $2$ to pair with the newly transcribed region $3$, leading to the formation of the $2$–$3$ antiterminator hairpin. The formation of this structure physically prevents region $3$ from pairing with region $4$, thereby precluding the formation of the $3$–$4$ terminator hairpin. As a result, RNA polymerase continues transcription through the structural genes of the operon.\n\nSynonymous mutations do not alter the amino acid sequence of the leader peptide. Therefore, the sensory mechanism, which is the ribosome's response to tryptophan availability, remains unchanged. However, these mutations alter the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA. The stability of an RNA hairpin is quantified by its Gibbs free energy of formation, $\\Delta G$, a value determined by its nucleotide sequence. A more negative $\\Delta G$ corresponds to a more stable structure.\n\nThe specific mutations in this problem replace two thermodynamically stable $\\mathrm{G}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{C}$ Watson-Crick pairs in the stem of the $2$–$3$ antiterminator with two less stable $\\mathrm{G}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{U}$ wobble pairs. This substitution results in a less negative (i.e., higher) $\\Delta G$ for the mutant antiterminator, indicating that it is thermodynamically destabilized relative to the wild-type structure. The attenuation switch relies on the efficient and rapid formation of the $2$–$3$ antiterminator upon ribosome stalling. A destabilized antiterminator forms less favorably, shifting the kinetic equilibrium. This increases the probability that region $3$ will remain single-stranded long enough for region $4$ to be transcribed and to form the competing, thermodynamically stable $3$–$4$ terminator hairpin. The formation of this terminator hairpin, even under low-tryptophan conditions, causes premature transcription termination. Thus, by weakening the antiterminator hairpin, the synonymous mutations disrupt the attenuation mechanism, leading to aberrant repression of the `trp` operon.\n\nTo quantify this effect, we compute the change in antiterminator stability, $\\Delta\\Delta G \\equiv \\Delta G_{\\text{mut}} - \\Delta G_{\\text{wt}}$.
