The calculated value $49.98$ already has four significant figures. Thus, the contour length is $L = 49.98$ nm.\n\nSecond, we determine the number of helical turns, $n$. This quantity represents how many full rotations the DNA double helix makes over its length. It is calculated by dividing the total number of base pairs, $N$, by the number of base pairs per helical turn, $R$.
