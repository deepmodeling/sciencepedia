The derivation will be built upon the three principles stipulated: the law of mass action, the Michaelis–Menten rate law, and the definition of velocity as expected displacement per unit time.\n\nFirst, we determine the concentration of the enzyme-nucleosome complex, $[EN]$, at equilibrium. The binding reaction is $E + N \\rightleftharpoons EN$. The dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the law of mass action as:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[E][N]}{[EN]}$$\nHere, $[E]$ and $[N]$ are the free concentrations of the enzyme and nucleosome, respectively.

The labeling geometry is designed specifically to probe the dynamics of entry DNA.\n2.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides all necessary information to infer a mechanism. The initial high-FRET state is consistent with a wrapped nucleosome. The observed transitions to a low-FRET state upon addition of remodeler and ATP present a clear phenomenon to be explained. The descriptions of how unwrapping and sliding are expected to affect the FRET signal provide the necessary constraints for the inference. There are no internal contradictions.\n3.  **Clarity**: The terminology is precise and standard for the field. The assumptions about the structural consequences of unwrapping versus sliding are explicitly stated, removing ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Mechanism**\nThe analysis begins by relating the observed FRET efficiencies to the interdye distances using the provided Förster equation, $E = \\dfrac{1}{1 + (R/R_0)^6}$, with $R_0 = 5.5 \\text{ nm}$.\n\n1.  **High-FRET State ($E \\approx 0.8$)**: This is the state observed in the absence of SWI/SNF and ATP, corresponding to the stable, fully wrapped nucleosome.\n    $$0.8 = \\frac{1}{1 + (R_{\\text{high}}/5.5)^6}$$\n    $$1 + (R_{\\text{high}}/5.5)^6 = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$$\n    $$(R_{\\text{high}}/5.5)^6 = 0.25$$\n    $$R_{\\text{high}} = 5.5 \\times (0.25)^{1/6} \\approx 5.5 \\times 0.8409 \\text{ nm} \\approx 4.6 \\text{ nm}$$\n    This relatively short distance is consistent with the problem's description of a fully wrapped state where the $5'$ entry DNA end is in close proximity to the H$2$A docking domain.\n\n2.  **Low-FRET State ($E \\approx 0.2$)**: This state is observed dynamically upon addition of SWI/SNF and ATP.\n    $$0.2 = \\frac{1}{1 + (R_{\\text{low}}/5.5)^6}$$\n    $$1 + (R_{\\text{low}}/5.5)^6 = \\frac{1}{0.2} = 5$$\n    $$(R_{\\text{low}}/5.5)^6 = 4$$\n    $$R_{\\text{low}} = 5.5 \\times (4)^{1/6} \\approx 5.5 \\times 1.2599 \\text{ nm} \\approx 6.9 \\text{ nm}$$\n    The transition corresponds to an increase in interdye distance of $\\Delta R = R_{\\text{low}} - R_{\\text{high}} \\approx 6.9 \\text{ nm} - 4.6 \\text{ nm} = 2.3 \\text{ nm}$.\n\n3.  **Mechanistic Inference**: The problem states that \"entry-side unwrapping... increases the spatial separation... by several nanometers,\" whereas \"sliding... leave[s] the entry DNA in contact with the H$2$A docking region.\" The observed transition from a compact, high-FRET state ($R \\approx 4.6 \\text{ nm}$) to an extended, low-FRET state ($R \\approx 6.9 \\text{ nm}$) involves a significant increase in distance. This observation directly matches the expected signature of DNA unwrapping. Conversely, it is inconsistent with the sliding mechanism, which, as described, would preserve the short distance between the dyes and thus maintain a high-FRET signal. The reversibility of the transitions corresponds to the rewrapping of the DNA onto the histone octamer. The anti-correlation of donor and acceptor intensities confirms that the observed signal changes are due to FRET. Therefore, the dynamics primarily reflect ATP-dependent DNA unwrapping and rewrapping.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nHaving inferred the mechanism, we now evaluate each option, which combines a mechanistic claim with a proposed experimental control.\n\n**A. The dynamics primarily reflect entry-side unwrapping and rewrapping. As a control to discriminate sliding, introduce a single-stranded DNA gap or nick at superhelical location $+2$ to block DNA translocation through SWI/SNF; persistence of large-amplitude anti-correlated FRET transitions in the presence of this barrier would support unwrapping over sliding.**\n- **Mechanistic Inference**: This is correct, as derived above.\n- **Control Experiment**: The SWI/SNF remodeler is a DNA translocase. The sliding mechanism is thought to involve the translocation of a substantial length of DNA around the histone octamer, which would require the translocase to move past superhelical location (SHL) $+2$ (approximately $20$ bp from the dyad). A nick or gap in the DNA backbone at this position would act as a significant physical barrier to the translocase, thereby inhibiting or blocking the sliding process. In contrast, unwrapping of the entry DNA could potentially be achieved by the remodeler acting locally on the DNA at or near the entry site, without needing to translocate past the barrier at SHL $+2$. Therefore, if the large-amplitude FRET transitions persist even with the nicked DNA substrate, it would strongly imply that the underlying mechanism does not require long-range translocation around the core, disfavoring sliding and supporting the unwrapping hypothesis. The logic of this control is sound and it provides a clean way to discriminate between the two mechanisms.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The dynamics primarily reflect octamer sliding in approximately base-pair steps. As a control to discriminate unwrapping, lower ionic strength to suppress DNA breathing; attenuation of transitions would support sliding.**\n- **Mechanistic Inference**: This is incorrect. As established, sliding is predicted to maintain a high-FRET state in this experimental geometry, which contradicts the observed transitions to $E \\approx 0.2$.\n- **Control Experiment**: The premise of the control is flawed. Lowering the ionic strength increases the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged phosphate backbones of the DNA, which typically *destabilizes* the DNA-histone interaction and *increases*, rather than suppresses, spontaneous DNA end \"breathing\". Furthermore, this control confounds passive thermal breathing with active, ATP-driven unwrapping by the remodeler, and it is not a clean way to distinguish active unwrapping from active sliding.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The dynamics primarily reflect dye photophysical blinking rather than structural changes. As a control, add an oxygen scavenging system and triplet-state quenchers; elimination of transitions would support photophysics.**\n- **Mechanistic Inference**: This is unlikely to be the primary cause. The problem explicitly states that the donor and acceptor fluorescence intensities are \"strictly anti-correlated.\" This signature is the hallmark of genuine FRET dynamics, where energy lost by the donor is gained by the acceptor. Simple photophysical blinking of one dye does not typically produce such a clean anti-correlated signal. While artifacts must always be considered, the data as described points strongly toward a structural change.\n- **Control Experiment**: The proposed control is standard procedure in smFRET experiments to minimize photoblinking and photobleaching. If the transitions were eliminated, it would indeed point to a photophysical artifact. However, the initial mechanistic inference is the weakest of the possibilities given the data, making this a less compelling overall option than A. The question asks for the combination that includes the *correct* inference.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The dynamics primarily reflect histone octamer eviction. As a control, add a histone chaperone to accelerate eviction; enhancement of transitions would support eviction over sliding or unwrapping.**\n- **Mechanistic Inference**: This is unlikely. Complete eviction of the histone octamer would cause the acceptor dye on H$2$A to diffuse far away from the donor on the DNA, resulting in a FRET efficiency approaching zero ($E \\approx 0$), not the observed stable level of $E \\approx 0.2$. The reversibility of the transitions is also more consistent with local unwrapping/rewrapping than with the typically slower and less readily reversible process of full octamer eviction and reassembly.\n- **Control Experiment**: While adding a histone chaperone is a valid way to test for a role of eviction, it is proposed here to validate a mechanism that is inconsistent with the primary data ($E \\approx 0.2$ state). The control is designed to test a less probable hypothesis.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOption A correctly identifies entry-side unwrapping as the mechanism responsible for the observed FRET signals and proposes a sophisticated and logically sound experimental control to rigorously distinguish this mechanism from the main alternative, sliding.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2933197"}]}
