The solution process may proceed.\n\nLet the E-box DNA binding site be denoted by $S$. Let the Myc-Max heterodimer be denoted by $A$ and the Mxd-Max heterodimer be denoted by $B$. The problem states that binding is mutually exclusive, meaning the site can be in one of three states: unbound ($S$), bound by Myc-Max ($SA$), or bound by Mxd-Max ($SB$).\n\nThe binding equilibria are described by the law of mass action:\n$$S + A \\rightleftharpoons SA$$\n$$S + B \\rightleftharpoons SB$$\nThe corresponding dissociation constants are defined as:\n$$K_d^A = K_d^{\\mathrm{Myc}} = \\frac{[S][A]}{[SA]}$$\n$$K_d^B = K_d^{\\mathrm{Mxd}} = \\frac{[S][B]}{[SB]}$$\nHere, $[S]$, $[A]$, and $[B]$ represent the equilibrium concentrations of the free species, while $[SA]$ and $[SB]$ represent the equilibrium concentrations of the bound complexes.\n\nThe problem states to assume that the concentration of the binding site is negligible compared to the concentrations of the protein heterodimers. This implies that the free concentrations $[A]$ and $[B]$ are approximately equal to their total concentrations.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of fold-repression, $F$, based on a statistical mechanical model of promoter accessibility. Let us proceed with rigor.\n\nFirst, we define the accessibility of a single nucleosome. The problem states that the accessibility scales with the Boltzmann factor. Let $p$ be the accessibility of a single nucleosome.\nIn the baseline state (without HDAC), the unwrapping free energy is $\\Delta E_{0}$. The accessibility for one nucleosome, which we denote as $p_{0}$, is therefore proportional to:\n$$\np_{0} \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E_{0}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\n$$\nIn the presence of the HDAC, the free-energy barrier is increased to $\\Delta E_{0} + \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{HDAC}}$. The accessibility for one nucleosome in this state, denoted $p_{\\mathrm{HDAC}}$, is proportional to:\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{HDAC}} \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E_{0} + \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{HDAC}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that there are $n$ nucleosomes which contribute independently and multiplicatively to the net promoter accessibility. Let $A_{0}$ and $A_{\\mathrm{HDAC}}$ be the net accessibilities for the entire promoter in the absence and presence of HDAC, respectively.\nFor a system of $n$ independent nucleosomes, the total probability of all sites being accessible is the product of the individual probabilities.\nThus, the net baseline accessibility $A_{0}$ is:\n$$\nA_{0} = (p_{0})^{n} \\propto \\left[\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E_{0}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\\right]^{n} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{n \\Delta E_{0}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\n$$\nSimilarly, the net accessibility with HDAC, $A_{\\mathrm{HDAC}}$, is:\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{HDAC}} = (p_{\\mathrm{HDAC}})^{n} \\propto \\left[\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E_{0} + \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{HDAC}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\\right]^{n} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{n (\\Delta E_{0} + \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{HDAC}})}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem defines the fold-repression, $F$, as the ratio $F \\equiv \\frac{A_{0}}{A_{\\mathrm{HDAC}}}$. We can now substitute our expressions for $A_{0}$ and $A_{\\mathrm{HDAC}}$ into this definition. The constant of proportionality, being the same for both states, will cancel.\n$$\nF = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{n \\Delta E_{0}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{n (\\Delta E_{0} + \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{HDAC}})}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)}\n$$\nUsing the property of exponents $\\frac{\\exp(a)}{\\exp(b)} = \\exp(a-b)$, we simplify the expression for $F$:\n$$\nF = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{n \\Delta E_{0}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} - \\left(-\\frac{n (\\Delta E_{0} + \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{HDAC}})}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\nF = \\exp\\left(\\frac{-n \\Delta E_{0} + n \\Delta E_{0} + n \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{HDAC}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nF = \\exp\\left(\\frac{n \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{HDAC}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the fold-repression $F$ in terms of $n$, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{HDAC}}$, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$, and $T$. It is notable that the baseline free energy $\\Delta E_{0}$ has canceled out, which is expected as we are considering a ratio of probabilities.\n\nNow, we must evaluate this expression for the given parameters: $n=3$ and $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{HDAC}}=3\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$.\nWe substitute these values into our derived formula for $F$:\n$$\nF = \\exp\\left(\\frac{3 \\cdot (3\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\n$$\nThe term $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$ in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n$$\nF = \\exp\\left(\\frac{9\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nF = \\exp(9)\n$$\nThis is the final exact expression for the fold-repression under the specified conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\exp(9)}$$", "id": "2967085"}, {"introduction": "Effectively repressing a gene involves more than just halting transcription; the true cellular response time is dictated by the stability of the molecules already produced.

The response time is expected to be significantly longer than the protein half-life for a $90\\%$ reduction, so $t_{0.10}$ will be large. Consequently, $x = \\exp(-k_{p}t_{0.10})$ will be a small positive number, $x \\ll 1$. For such small $x$, the term $x^6$ is negligible in comparison to the linear terms. We can therefore approximate the equation as:\n$$-6x + 0.5 \\approx 0 \\implies x \\approx \\frac{0.5}{6} = \\frac{1}{12}$$\nThe error introduced by this approximation is on the order of $x^6 \\approx (1/12)^6 \\approx 3 \\times 10^{-7}$, which is insignificant for the required precision.\nWe now solve for $t_{0.10}$ using this approximate value of $x$:\n$$\\exp(-k_{p}t_{0.10}) \\approx \\frac{1}{12}$$\n$$-k_{p}t_{0.10} \\approx \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\right) = -\\ln(12)$$\n$$t_{0.10} \\approx \\frac{\\ln(12)}{k_{p}}$$\nSubstituting the value for $k_{p}$:\n$$t_{0.10} \\approx \\frac{\\ln(12)}{\\ln(2) / 120 \\text{ min}} = 120 \\frac{\\ln(12)}{\\ln(2)} \\text{ min}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$t_{0.10} \\approx 120 \\times \\frac{2.4849066}{0.6931472} \\text{ min} \\approx 120 \\times 3.5849625 \\text{ min} \\approx 430.1955 \\text{ min}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$t_{0.10} \\approx 430.2 \\text{ min}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{430.2}$$", "id": "2967099"}]}
