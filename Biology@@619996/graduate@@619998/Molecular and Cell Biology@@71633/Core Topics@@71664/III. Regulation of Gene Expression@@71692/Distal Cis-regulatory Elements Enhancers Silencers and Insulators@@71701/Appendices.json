The binding of a transcription factor to a DNA regulatory element is a cornerstone of molecular biology.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and complete. It is a straightforward application of fundamental biophysical principles.\n\nVerdict: The problem is valid.\n\nSolution:\nThe interaction between the activator protein ($A$) and its specific binding site on the enhancer ($S$) can be represented by the reversible binding equilibrium:\n$$\nA + S \\rightleftharpoons AS\n$$\nwhere $AS$ is the complex of the activator bound to the site.\n\nThe dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the equilibrium concentrations of the species involved:\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{[A][S]}{[AS]}\n$$\nHere, $[A]$ is the concentration of the free activator, $[S]$ is the concentration of the free (unoccupied) binding sites, and $[AS]$ is the concentration of the occupied binding sites. The problem states that the total concentration of sites is small, so we can treat the concentration of the free activator $[A]$ as being equal to the total activator concentration, which is given as $20\\,\\text{nM}$.\n\nThe fractional occupancy, denoted by $\\theta$, is defined as the fraction of total binding sites that are occupied by the activator. Mathematically, this is:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{\\text{Concentration of occupied sites}}{\\text{Total concentration of sites}} = \\frac{[AS]}{[S] + [AS]}\n$$\nTo express $\\theta$ in terms of $[A]$ and $K_d$, we first rearrange the definition of $K_d$ to express $[S]$ in terms of $[AS]$:\n$$\n[S] = \\frac{K_d [AS]}{[A]}\n$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[S]$ into the equation for $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[AS]}{\\frac{K_d [AS]}{[A]} + [AS]}\n$$\nThe term $[AS]$ is common to the numerator and the denominator, so it can be canceled out:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[A]} + 1}\n$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $[A]$ gives the final, standard form of the binding isotherm, often called the Langmuir isotherm in this context:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[A]}{[A] + K_d}\n$$\nThis equation gives the fractional occupancy of the sites at equilibrium as a function of the activator concentration and the dissociation constant.

The fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, represents the probability that a given enhancer site is occupied by an activator at any moment in time. According to the problem's assumption (iii), transcription rate is coupled to this probability.\nIn the absence of the activator ($[A] = 0$), the fractional occupancy is $\\theta = 0$. In the presence of the activator, the fractional occupancy is $\\theta \\approx 0.667$. Since $\\theta > 0$, and the recruitment of RNA Pol II increases monotonically with $\\theta$, the rate of transcription will be **increased** relative to the case with no activator.\n\nTo assess whether the change is \"weak\" or \"strong\", we must consider the position on the response curve. The response curve is steep around the value of $K_d$. The given concentration $[A] = 20\\,\\text{nM}$ is equal to $2K_d$. At $[A]=K_d$, the occupancy is exactly $0.5$. Our calculated occupancy of $\\theta \\approx 0.667$ means the site is occupied two-thirds of the time. This is a substantial fraction of the maximum possible occupancy of $1$. This level of occupancy is significantly above the basal (zero) level and represents a robust response. Therefore, the change in transcription is expected to be **strong**. A weak change would be more characteristic of a very low fractional occupancy, for example, if $[A] \\ll K_d$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of equilibrium thermodynamics as applied to gene regulation, a standard framework in quantitative biology. It is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and definitions for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, unambiguous language. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe first task is to derive the equilibrium binding occupancy, $p_{\\mathrm{bound}}$, of the silencer by the repressor protein. Let $R$ be the repressor, $S$ be the silencer site, and $RS$ be the repressor-silencer complex. The system is described by the reversible binding reaction $R + S \\rightleftharpoons RS$. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the dissociation constant $K_d$ is defined as:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[R][S]}{[RS]}$$\nwhere $[R]$, $[S]$, and $[RS]$ are the equilibrium molar concentrations of the respective species.\n\nThe occupancy, $p_{\\mathrm{bound}}$, is the fraction of total silencer sites that are in the bound state. If $[S]_{\\text{total}}$ is the total concentration of silencer sites, then $[S]_{\\text{total}} = [S] + [RS]$. The occupancy is thus:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\frac{[RS]}{[S]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[RS]}{[S] + [RS]}$$\nTo express $p_{\\mathrm{bound}}$ in terms of the provided parameters, we rearrange the definition of $K_d$ to solve for $[S]$:\n$$[S] = \\frac{K_d [RS]}{[R]}$$\nWe substitute this expression for $[S]$ into the denominator of the equation for $p_{\\mathrm{bound}}$:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\frac{[RS]}{\\frac{K_d [RS]}{[R]} + [RS]}$$\nThe term $[RS]$ appears in the numerator and in each term of the denominator, so it can be canceled:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[R]} + 1} = \\frac{[R]}{K_d + [R]}$$\nThis is the required general expression for binding occupancy. The problem states we are in a dilute regime where the silencer site concentration is negligible, justifying the use of the total repressor concentration for the free repressor concentration $[R]$. We are given $K_d = 5 \\ \\text{nM}$ and $[R] = 10 \\ \\text{nM}$. Substituting these values:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\frac{10}{5 + 10} = \\frac{10}{15} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n\nThe second task is to derive the fold-change in the mean promoter initiation rate. The system exists in two states: the silencer is unbound or it is bound. The probability of the unbound state is $p_{\\mathrm{unbound}} = 1 - p_{\\mathrm{bound}}$. The probability of the bound state is $p_{\\mathrm{bound}}$. The initiation rate in the unbound state is the basal rate, $k_0$. The initiation rate in the bound state is reduced by a factor $\\frac{1}{1+\\beta}$, so the rate is $k_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\beta}\\right)$.\n\nThe expected, or average, initiation rate, $\\langle k \\rangle$, is the weighted average of the rates in each state, where the weights are the probabilities of those states:\n$$\\langle k \\rangle = (p_{\\mathrm{unbound}} \\times k_0) + \\left(p_{\\mathrm{bound}} \\times k_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\beta}\\right)\\right)$$\nSubstituting $p_{\\mathrm{unbound}} = 1 - p_{\\mathrm{bound}}$:\n$$\\langle k \\rangle = (1 - p_{\\mathrm{bound}})k_0 + p_{\\mathrm{bound}} \\frac{k_0}{1+\\beta}$$\nThe problem asks for the fold-change relative to the basal rate $k_0$.
