This involves a series of calculations and logical checks against provided definitions. The final result is to be encoded as a single integer, $S$.\n\nFirst, a consistency check of the provided data is performed. The sum of the mononucleotide counts is $N_{\\mathrm{A}} + N_{\\mathrm{C}} + N_{\\mathrm{G}} + N_{\\mathrm{T}} = 280 + 240 + 220 + 60 = 800$. This sum is equal to the total length $L = 800$, confirming the data is self-consistent.\n\nThe solution proceeds by executing the four specified tasks in order.\n\nTask 1: Computation of composition-based quantities.\n\nThe Guanine–Cytosine content ($\\mathrm{GC\\%}$) is the percentage of guanine and cytosine bases in the segment. Using the given counts $N_{\\mathrm{G}} = 220$, $N_{\\mathrm{C}} = 240$, and total length $L = 800$, the calculation is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{GC\\%} = 100 \\times \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{G}} + N_{\\mathrm{C}}}{L} = 100 \\times \\frac{220 + 240}{800} = 100 \\times \\frac{460}{800} = 100 \\times 0.575 = 57.5\n$$\nSo, the GC content is $57.5\\%$.\n\nThe CpG frequency ($f_{\\mathrm{CpG}}$) is the fraction of CpG dinucleotides. For a linear sequence of length $L$, there are $L-1$ possible adjacent dinucleotide pairs. With $N_{\\mathrm{CpG}} = 45$ and $L = 800$:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{CpG}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{CpG}}}{L-1} = \\frac{45}{800-1} = \\frac{45}{799}\n$$\n\nThe observed-to-expected CpG ratio compares the observed number of CpG dinucleotides to the number expected from random association of C and G mononucleotides. Using the given formula:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\text{observed}}{\\text{expected}}\\right)_{\\mathrm{CpG}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{CpG}} \\times L}{N_{\\mathrm{C}} \\times N_{\\mathrm{G}}} = \\frac{45 \\times 800}{240 \\times 220} = \\frac{36000}{52800} = \\frac{360}{528} = \\frac{15}{22}\n$$\nFor comparison with thresholds, the decimal value is approximately $0.6818$.\n\nTask 2: CpG island classification.\n\nWe evaluate the segment against two sets of criteria for CpG islands. This determines the values of the indicator variables $\\mathbb{I}_{\\text{classic}}$ and $\\mathbb{I}_{\\text{updated}}$.\n\nFor the classic criteria (Gardiner-Garden and Frommer):\n1.  Length: Is $L > 200$? Yes, $800 > 200$.\n2.  GC content: Is $\\mathrm{GC\\%} > 50$? Yes, $57.5 > 50$.\n3.  CpG ratio: Is $\\left(\\frac{\\text{observed}}{\\text{expected}}\\right)_{\\mathrm{CpG}} > 0.6$? Yes, $\\frac{15}{22} \\approx 0.6818 > 0.6$.\nSince all three conditions are met, the segment qualifies as a classic CpG island. Therefore, $\\mathbb{I}_{\\text{classic}} = 1$.\n\nFor the updated criteria (Takai and Jones):\n1.  Length: Is $L \\ge 500$? Yes, $800 \\ge 500$.\n2.  GC content: Is $\\mathrm{GC\\%} \\ge 55$? Yes, $57.5 \\ge 55$.\n3.  CpG ratio: Is $\\left(\\frac{\\text{observed}}{\\text{expected}}\\right)_{\\mathrm{CpG}} \\ge 0.65$? Yes, $\\frac{15}{22} \\approx 0.6818 \\ge 0.65$. This is confirmed by comparing $\\frac{15}{22}$ and $0.65 = \\frac{13}{20}$. The inequality $15 \\times 20 > 13 \\times 22$ simplifies to $300 > 286$, which is true.\nSince all three conditions are met, the segment also qualifies under the updated criteria. Therefore, $\\mathbb{I}_{\\text{updated}} = 1$.\n\nTask 3: Core promoter motif identification.\n\nWe evaluate the candidate sequences for TATA box and Initiator (Inr) elements. This determines $\\mathbb{I}_{\\text{TATA}}$ and $\\mathbb{I}_{\\text{Inr}}$.\n\nFor the TATA box, the consensus is `$5'$-TATAWAAR-$3'$` ($W \\in \\{\\mathrm{A},\\mathrm{T}\\}$, $R \\in \\{\\mathrm{A},\\mathrm{G}\\}$) with a starting position $x$ in the range $-35 \\le x \\le -20$.\n-   Candidate 1: `$5'$-TATATATT-$3'$` at $[-35,-28]$. The start position $x=-35$ is valid. We check the sequence: TATA[T is W]A[T is not A]... The sequence does not match the consensus at the $7^{th}$ position. This candidate is not a TATA box.\n-   Candidate 2: `$5'$-TATAAAAG-$3'$` at $[-31,-24]$. The start position $x=-31$ is valid. We check the sequence against `$5'$-TATAWAAR-$3'$`:\n    -   Positions $1-4$: T-A-T-A match.\n    -   Position $5$: A matches W.\n    -   Position $6$: A matches A.\n    -   Position $7$: A matches A.\n    -   Position $8$: G matches R.\nThe sequence is an exact match to the consensus. Thus, a TATA box is present. Therefore, $\\mathbb{I}_{\\text{TATA}} = 1$.\n\nFor the Initiator (Inr) element, the consensus is `$5'$-YYANWYY-$3'$` ($Y \\in \\{\\mathrm{C},\\mathrm{T}\\}$, $W \\in \\{\\mathrm{A},\\mathrm{T}\\}$, $N$ is any nucleotide) for the $7$-mer spanning $[-2,+4]$.\n-   Candidate sequence: `$5'$-TCAGTCT-$3'$` at positions $[-2,+4]$. We check this sequence against the consensus:\n    -   Position $1$ (at $-2$): T matches Y.\n    -   Position $2$ (at $-1$): C matches Y.\n    -   Position $3$ (at $0$): A matches A.\n    -   Position $4$ (at $+1$): G matches N.\n    -   Position $5$ (at $+2$): T matches W.\n    -   Position $6$ (at $+3$): C matches Y.\n    -   Position $7$ (at $+4$): T matches Y.\nThe sequence is an exact match to the degenerate consensus. Thus, an Initiator element is present. Therefore, $\\mathbb{I}_{\\text{Inr}} = 1$.\n\nTask 4: Computation of the summary integer code $S$.\n\nThe final code $S$ is calculated using the determined indicator variables:\n$$\nS = 8\\,\\mathbb{I}_{\\text{updated}} + 4\\,\\mathbb{I}_{\\text{classic}} + 2\\,\\mathbb{I}_{\\text{TATA}} + 1\\,\\mathbb{I}_{\\text{Inr}}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived values $\\mathbb{I}_{\\text{updated}} = 1$, $\\mathbb{I}_{\\text{classic}} = 1$, $\\mathbb{I}_{\\text{TATA}} = 1$, and $\\mathbb{I}_{\\text{Inr}} = 1$:\n$$\nS = 8(1) + 4(1) + 2(1) + 1(1) = 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15\n$$\nThe resulting integer code is $15$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{15}$$", "id": "2959949"}, {"introduction": "Building on motif identification, this problem challenges you to predict the functional consequences of altering a promoter's architecture.

This type of deductive reasoning is central to molecular genetics, connecting genotype to phenotype and interpreting the impact of genetic variants on gene regulation.", "problem": "A gene with a canonical CpG-island promoter shows a broad cluster of transcription start sites (TSSs) spanning approximately $-40$ to $+40$ relative to the annotated dominant TSS at position $0$, consistent with a TATA-less, Initiator (Inr)-poor core promoter typical of housekeeping genes. A germline single-nucleotide variant introduces a high-affinity TATA-like motif (approximating TATAWAWR) centered at position $-80$ relative to the annotated TSS. The gene’s upstream region from $-150$ to $+50$ is nucleosome-depleted, with a flanking $+1$ nucleosome positioned at approximately $+120$. Prior to the variant, Chromatin immunoprecipitation signals for Transcription Factor IID (TFIID) and RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) were diffuse across the nucleosome-depleted region, and Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) showed a broad peak. DNA methylation across the CpG island is low and unchanged in cells harboring the variant.\n\nUsing only core principles of eukaryotic transcription initiation by RNA Polymerase II, including the roles of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) within TFIID, preinitiation complex assembly, and general features distinguishing TATA-containing focused promoters from TATA-less CpG island promoters, reason about how the de novo TATA-like motif could reprogram core promoter function.

The introduced TATA-like motif nucleates a focused preinitiation complex, redirecting initiation to a new dominant TSS located downstream of the new motif by a stereotyped distance, yielding a sharp CAGE peak upstream of the original cluster, a corresponding upstream shift in promoter-proximal Pol II pausing detected by Precision Run-On sequencing (PRO-seq), and a $5^{\\prime}$ untranslated region extended by the expected displacement, with potential creation of upstream open reading frames; initiation within the original CpG-island cluster is diminished due to local competition for TFIID and Transcription initiation factor IIB (TFIIB).\n\nB.

This is characteristic of housekeeping genes.\n*   **Initial Transcription Pattern:** A broad cluster of transcription start sites (TSSs) from approximately $-40$ to $+40$ relative to the annotated dominant TSS at position $0$. This corresponds to a broad peak in Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) data.\n*   **Genetic Alteration:** A single-nucleotide variant introduces a high-affinity TATA-like motif (TATAWAWR) centered at position $-80$.\n*   **Chromatin Environment:** The region from $-150$ to $+50$ is nucleosome-depleted. A $+1$ nucleosome is located around $+120$.\n*   **Initial Factor Occupancy:** Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) signals for Transcription Factor IID (TFIID) and RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) are diffuse across the nucleosome-depleted region.\n*   **Epigenetic State:** DNA methylation is low across the CpG island and remains unchanged after the variant appears.\n\n**Validation:**\n1.  **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly grounded in the established principles of eukaryotic transcription initiation by RNA Polymerase II. It correctly contrasts the two major classes of core promoters: TATA-less, CpG island promoters with dispersed initiation, and TATA-box-containing promoters with focused initiation. The description of the roles of TFIID, TBP, and the preinitiation complex (PIC) is accurate. The experimental techniques mentioned (CAGE, PRO-seq) and their expected readouts are appropriately described.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem presents a clear initial state and a single, well-defined perturbation (the introduction of a TATA box). It asks for the most likely mechanistic consequence, implying that a single, best-fit model based on first principles should exist.\n3.  **Objectivity and Clarity:** The problem is stated using precise, objective terminology. The positions of elements are given numerically (TATA at $-80$, TSS cluster from $-40$ to $+40$), and motifs are specified (TATAWAWR). There is no ambiguity or subjective language.\n4.  **Consistency:** The provided information is internally consistent. A TATA-less, Inr-poor, CpG island promoter is expected to have a broad TSS distribution and diffuse TFIID/Pol II binding, as stated. A nucleosome-depleted region makes the DNA, including the new TATA motif, accessible to transcription factors. The unchanged low DNA methylation is a critical piece of information that rules out epigenetic silencing as a primary mechanism.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem statement is valid. It is a well-formulated question that tests fundamental knowledge of molecular biology. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe core of this problem lies in understanding the functional dominance of a high-affinity TATA box in directing the assembly of the preinitiation complex (PIC).\n\n1.  **Core Promoter Function:** Eukaryotic transcription initiation begins with the binding of the general transcription factor TFIID to the core promoter. TFIID is a complex containing the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and several TBP-associated factors (TAFs).\n    *   In **TATA-less promoters**, like the initial state of this gene, TFIID recruitment is mediated by TAFs recognizing various sequence elements (e.g., Inr, DPE) or chromatin features. In a CpG island that is also Inr-poor, TFIID binding is likely a result of cumulative, weak interactions across the GC-rich region, leading to diffuse binding and dispersed initiation sites. This is consistent with the initial \"broad cluster of TSSs\".\n    *   In **TATA-containing promoters**, the binding of TBP to the TATA box sequence (TATAWAWR) is a high-affinity interaction that serves as the principal nucleation event for PIC assembly. This single, strong interaction provides a stable anchor for the entire complex.\n\n2.  **Mechanistic Consequence of the Variant:** The introduction of a high-affinity TATA-like motif at position $-80$ fundamentally changes the landscape for TFIID recruitment.\n    *   **A New Focal Point:** The TATA box at $-80$ creates a powerful, specific binding site for TBP/TFIID. This site will outcompete the weak, diffuse interactions across the CpG island for the limited cellular pool of TFIID and other general transcription factors like TFIIB.\n    *   **Repositioning of the PIC:** PIC assembly will now be predominantly nucleated at the new TATA box. The stereochemistry of the assembled PIC, particularly the spatial relationship between TBP at the TATA box, TFIIB, and RNA Polymerase II, dictates the location of the TSS. The distance between the first base of the TATA box and the TSS is stereotypically fixed at approximately $25-30$ base pairs. Given a TATA box centered at $-80$, the new, focused TSS is expected to be located at roughly $-80 + 30 = -50$.\n\n3.  **Predicted Experimental Signatures:**\n    *   **TSS Mapping (CAGE):** The broad CAGE peak spanning $-40$ to $+40$ will be significantly reduced. A new, dominant, and sharp CAGE peak will appear at approximately position $-50$. This new peak is upstream of the original TSS cluster.\n    *   **Transcriptional Elongation (PRO-seq):** Promoter-proximal pausing of Pol II occurs shortly after initiation, typically in the $+30$ to $+60$ bp region relative to the TSS. Shifting the dominant TSS from ~$0$ to ~$-50$ will cause a corresponding upstream shift in the location of promoter-proximal paused Pol II.\n    *   **Transcript Structure:** Since the transcript now starts at ~$-50$ instead of ~0, the resulting mRNA will have a $5^{\\prime}$ untranslated region ($5^{\\prime}$ UTR) that is approximately $50$ nucleotides longer. This extension increases the likelihood of creating new upstream open reading frames (uORFs), which are sequences beginning with an AUG codon within the $5^{\\prime}$ UTR that can impact the translation of the main protein.\n    *   **Competition:** The redirection of the transcription machinery to the new TATA box will diminish the resources available for initiation at the original, weaker sites within the CpG island.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluation of the Options\n\n**A. The introduced TATA-like motif nucleates a focused preinitiation complex, redirecting initiation to a new dominant TSS located downstream of the new motif by a stereotyped distance, yielding a sharp CAGE peak upstream of the original cluster, a corresponding upstream shift in promoter-proximal Pol II pausing detected by Precision Run-On sequencing (PRO-seq), and a $5^{\\prime}$ untranslated region extended by the expected displacement, with potential creation of upstream open reading frames; initiation within the original CpG-island cluster is diminished due to local competition for TFIID and Transcription initiation factor IIB (TFIIB).**\nThis option accurately describes all the expected consequences. The TATA box focuses initiation at a new upstream TSS, leading to a sharp CAGE peak upstream of the original cluster, an upstream shift in Pol II pausing, an extended $5^{\\prime}$ UTR, and a reduction in initiation from the original sites due to competition.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The introduced TATA-like motif has negligible effect because CpG islands are intrinsically TATA-refractory; the TSS distribution, CAGE profile, and PRO-seq pausing remain unchanged, but the CpG island acquires higher DNA methylation, leading to reduced transcription overall.**\nThis option is incorrect for two main reasons. First, the premise that CpG islands are \"TATA-refractory\" is false; a high-affinity TATA sequence will be bound by TBP if it is accessible, which it is in a nucleosome-depleted region. Second, it contradicts the problem statement that \"DNA methylation... is unchanged\".\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The introduced TATA-like motif primarily enhances divergent antisense initiation upstream while leaving sense-direction initiation unchanged, producing a symmetric increase in PRO-seq signal upstream and no change in CAGE-defined sense TSS positions; TBP binding at TATA boxes is inherently bidirectional and does not focus initiation.**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. Its central claim that TATA boxes do not focus initiation is a direct contradiction of one of the most established principles in molecular biology. The primary role of a TATA box is to create a focused initiation site. Claiming that sense-direction initiation would remain unchanged is also incorrect, as the new TATA box would compete for and reprogram the machinery.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The introduced TATA-like motif drives a downstream shift of the dominant sense TSS by approximately $+30$ relative to the original annotated TSS, shortening the $5^{\\prime}$ untranslated region, and increases TBP occupancy only outside CpG islands because TBP cannot stably bind within CpG-rich DNA; PRO-seq shows pausing moved farther downstream, with no upstream changes.**\nThis option makes several errors. A TATA box at $-80$ will shift the TSS to approximately $-50$, which is an *upstream* shift relative to the original TSS at $0$, not a downstream one. Consequently, the $5^{\\prime}$ UTR is lengthened, not shortened. The claim that TBP cannot bind within CpG-rich DNA is also incorrect; binding is determined by the presence of the consensus sequence and DNA accessibility, not the surrounding nucleotide composition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThus, option A provides the only mechanistically sound and comprehensive description of the consequences.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2959964"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice moves beyond simple consensus sequences to the more powerful and nuanced framework of probabilistic modeling.

It is defined as the natural logarithm of the likelihood ratio:\n$$\\mathcal{S}(S) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{P(S|\\text{PWM})}{P(S|\\text{BG})}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the probabilities from the two models:\n$$\\mathcal{S}(S) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\prod_{j=1}^{L} p_{j,s_j}}{\\prod_{j=1}^{L} \\pi_{s_j}}\\right)$$\nBy the properties of the logarithm, this expression simplifies to a sum over the positions of the sequence:\n$$\\mathcal{S}(S) = \\sum_{j=1}^{L} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{j,s_j}}{\\pi_{s_j}}\\right)$$\nThis is the derived log-odds scoring function. The term $w_{j,b} = \\ln(p_{j,s_j}/\\pi_{s_j})$ is the log-odds score for base $b$ at position $j$. The total score for a sequence is the sum of the scores of its constituent bases at their respective positions.\n\nNext, we must estimate the probabilities $p_{j,b}$ that constitute the PWM. The problem specifies a Bayesian approach. For each position $j$, we have observed nucleotide counts $\\mathbf{n}_j = (n_{j,A}, n_{j,C}, n_{j,G}, n_{j,T})$ from a sample of $N=50$ sequences. The likelihood of these counts, given the probability vector $\\mathbf{p}_j = (p_{j,A}, p_{j,C}, p_{j,G}, p_{j,T})$, follows a multinomial distribution.\n\nA Dirichlet prior is placed on the probability vector $\\mathbf{p}_j$. The prior is specified as $\\mathbf{p}_j \\sim \\text{Dir}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})$, where the parameter vector $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = (\\alpha_A, \\alpha_C, \\alpha_G, \\alpha_T)$ is determined by the total concentration parameter $\\lambda=4$ and the background base distribution $\\boldsymbol{\\pi} = (0.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.2)$. Specifically, $\\alpha_b = \\lambda \\pi_b$ for each base $b$.\nThe prior parameters are:\n- $\\alpha_A = 4 \\times 0.2 = 0.8$\n- $\\alpha_C = 4 \\times 0.3 = 1.2$\n- $\\alpha_G = 4 \\times 0.3 = 1.2$\n- $\\alpha_T = 4 \\times 0.2 = 0.8$\n\nThe Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate prior to the multinomial likelihood. Thus, the posterior distribution for $\\mathbf{p}_j$ after observing counts $\\mathbf{n}_j$ is also a Dirichlet distribution, with updated parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}'_j = \\mathbf{n}_j + \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$.\n$$P(\\mathbf{p}_j|\\mathbf{n}_j, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}) \\sim \\text{Dir}(\\mathbf{n}_j + \\boldsymbol{\\alpha})$$\n\nThe PWM is defined by the posterior mean estimates of the probabilities. For a Dirichlet distribution with parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}'_j$, the mean of the $b$-th component is:\n$$p_{j,b} = E[p_{j,b}|\\mathbf{n}_j, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}] = \\frac{n_{j,b} + \\alpha_b}{\\sum_{k \\in \\{A,C,G,T\\}} (n_{j,k} + \\alpha_k)} = \\frac{n_{j,b} + \\alpha_b}{N + \\lambda}$$\nGiven $N=50$ and $\\lambda=4$, the denominator is $50+4=54$.\n\nNow we calculate the log-odds score for the test sequence $S = \\text{\"CTAAATC\"}$. The sequence is composed of bases $s_1=C, s_2=T, s_3=A, s_4=A, s_5=A, s_6=T, s_7=C$.
