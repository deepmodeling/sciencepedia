It is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and definitions provided to derive the required expressions and compute the numerical results. The language is objective and precise. The problem is valid.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe net rate of subunit addition (flux) at a single end of the microtubule, denoted $J_{\\text{end}}$, is described by the difference between the association rate and the dissociation rate.\nThe association rate follows pseudo-first-order kinetics and is proportional to the free tubulin concentration $C$: $k_{\\mathrm{on}} C$.\nThe dissociation rate follows first-order kinetics and is constant: $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$.\nTherefore, the net flux in subunits per second is:\n$$J_{\\text{end}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} C - k_{\\mathrm{off}}$$\nA positive flux ($J_{\\text{end}} > 0$) corresponds to net growth, while a negative flux ($J_{\\text{end}} < 0$) corresponds to net shortening.\n\nThe critical concentration, $C_c$, is defined as the concentration at which the net flux is zero.\n$$J_{\\text{end}}(C_c) = k_{\\mathrm{on}} C_c - k_{\\mathrm{off}} = 0$$\nSolving for $C_c$ yields:\n$$C_c = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}$$\nThis can be computed separately for the plus and minus ends:\n$$C_{c}^{+} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{+}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{+}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad C_{c}^{-} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{-}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{-}}$$\n\nTreadmilling is defined as simultaneous net growth at the plus end and net shortening at the minus end.\nThe condition for net growth at the plus end is $J^{+} > 0$, which implies $k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{+} C - k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{+} > 0$, or $C > \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{+}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{+}}$. This is equivalent to $C > C_{c}^{+}$.\nThe condition for net shortening at the minus end is $J^{-} < 0$, which implies $k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{-} C - k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{-} < 0$, or $C < \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{-}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{-}}$. This is equivalent to $C < C_{c}^{-}$.\nCombining these two conditions, the concentration range for treadmilling is:\n$$C_{c}^{+} < C < C_{c}^{-}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the critical concentrations gives the required inequality:\n$$\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{+}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{+}} < C < \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{-}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{-}}$$\nThis is the condition for treadmilling. It is only possible if $C_c^{+} < C_c^{-}$.\n\nNow, we perform the numerical calculations as requested.\nFirst, we compute the critical concentrations for the given microtubule parameters.\n$$C_{c}^{+} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{+}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{+}} = \\frac{0.80\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{5.2\\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 0.1538\\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}$$\n$$C_{c}^{-} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{-}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{-}} = \\frac{1.70\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{2.9\\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 0.5862\\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}$$\nThe treadmilling regime is the interval $(0.1538, 0.5862)\\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}$.\nThe given concentration is $C = 0.40\\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}$. Since $0.1538 < 0.40 < 0.5862$, the microtubule is indeed in the treadmilling regime.\n\nNext, we compute the net axial length change rate, $v$. The rate of length change at an end is the net subunit flux at that end multiplied by the length added per subunit, $d$.\nRate of change at the plus end: $v^{+} = J^{+} d = (k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{+} C - k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{+}) d$.\nRate of change at the minus end: $v^{-} = J^{-} d = (k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{-} C - k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{-}) d$.\nThe total net rate of change of the microtubule length, $v$, is the algebraic sum of the rates at the two ends:\n$$v = v^{+} + v^{-}$$\n$$v = (k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{+} C - k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{+}) d + (k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{-} C - k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{-}) d$$\nFactoring out $d$ and rearranging terms gives:\n$$v = d \\left[ (k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{+} + k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{-})C - (k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{+} + k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{-}) \\right]$$\nWe substitute the given numerical values:\n$k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{+} = 5.2\\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{+} = 0.80\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{-} = 2.9\\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{-} = 1.70\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $C = 0.40\\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}$, and $d = 8.2\\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nSum of association rate constants:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{+} + k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{-} = 5.2 + 2.9 = 8.1\\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nSum of dissociation rate constants:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{+} + k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{-} = 0.80 + 1.70 = 2.50\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nNow substitute these into the expression for $v$:\n$$v = (8.2\\ \\mathrm{nm}) \\left[ (8.1\\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(0.40\\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}) - (2.50\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\right]$$\n$$v = (8.2\\ \\mathrm{nm}) \\left[ 3.24\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} - 2.50\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\right]$$\n$$v = (8.2\\ \\mathrm{nm}) \\left[ 0.74\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\right]$$\n$$v = 6.068\\ \\mathrm{nm}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

It is scientifically grounded in the widely accepted Dogterom-Leibler model of microtubule dynamic instability, is self-contained with all necessary parameters and boundary conditions, and is free of ambiguity or contradiction. We shall therefore proceed with its solution.\n\nLet $p_g(x)$ and $p_s(x)$ be the steady-state probability densities for finding a microtubule with its plus end at position $x$, in the growing and shrinking states, respectively. The total probability density is $p(x) = p_g(x) + p_s(x)$. The dynamics are governed by a set of coupled continuity equations, which express the conservation of probability for each state population.\n\nFor the growing state population, the change in probability density at a given position is determined by the flux of microtubules growing into and out of that position, and the stochastic switching to and from the shrinking state. In the steady state ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$), the continuity equation is:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} J_g(x) = -f_c p_g(x) + f_r p_s(x) $$\nwhere $J_g(x) = v_g p_g(x)$ is the probability flux for growing microtubules. Thus, we have:\n$$ v_g \\frac{d p_g}{dx} = -f_c p_g(x) + f_r p_s(x) \\quad (1) $$\n\nFor the shrinking state population, the flux is $J_s(x) = -v_s p_s(x)$, and the corresponding steady-state continuity equation is:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} J_s(x) = f_c p_g(x) - f_r p_s(x) $$\nThis gives:\n$$ -v_s \\frac{d p_s}{dx} = f_c p_g(x) - f_r p_s(x) \\quad (2) $$\n\nComparing equations $(1)$ and $(2)$, we observe that their right-hand sides are equal and opposite. This leads to:\n$$ v_g \\frac{d p_g}{dx} = - \\left( -v_s \\frac{d p_s}{dx} \\right) \\implies v_g \\frac{d p_g}{dx} - v_s \\frac{d p_s}{dx} = 0 $$\nIntegrating this equation with respect to $x$ yields:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( v_g p_g(x) - v_s p_s(x) \\right) = 0 $$\n$$ v_g p_g(x) - v_s p_s(x) = J_0 $$\nwhere $J_0$ is a constant representing the total net probability flux along the length of the microtubule.\n\nFor a normalizable steady-state distribution to exist, the probability densities must vanish at infinity: $p_g(x \\to \\infty) \\to 0$ and $p_s(x \\to \\infty) \\to 0$. This implies that there can be no net flux of microtubules towards infinity. Therefore, the total flux constant $J_0$ must be zero.\n$$ J_0 = v_g p_g(x) - v_s p_s(x) = 0 $$\nThis provides a crucial algebraic relationship between the two probability densities for all $x > 0$:\n$$ p_s(x) = \\frac{v_g}{v_s} p_g(x) \\quad (3) $$\n\nThe boundary condition at $x=0$ states that any microtubule shrinking to a length of zero is instantaneously re-nucleated in the growing state. This means the flux of shrinking microtubules arriving at $x=0$, given by $|J_s(0)| = v_s p_s(0)$, must equal the flux of growing microtubules originating from $x=0$, given by $J_g(0) = v_g p_g(0)$. The boundary condition is thus $v_g p_g(0) = v_s p_s(0)$. This is automatically satisfied by the zero-flux condition evaluated at $x=0$.\n\nWe can now solve for the functional form of the distributions. Substitute equation $(3)$ into equation $(1)$:\n$$ v_g \\frac{d p_g}{dx} = -f_c p_g(x) + f_r \\left(\\frac{v_g}{v_s} p_g(x)\\right) $$\n$$ v_g \\frac{d p_g}{dx} = \\left(\\frac{f_r v_g}{v_s} - f_c\\right) p_g(x) $$\n$$ \\frac{d p_g}{dx} = \\left(\\frac{f_r}{v_s} - \\frac{f_c}{v_g}\\right) p_g(x) $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation, whose solution is an exponential function:\n$$ p_g(x) = A \\exp\\left[ \\left(\\frac{f_r}{v_s} - \\frac{f_c}{v_g}\\right) x \\right] $$\nwhere $A$ is an integration constant. Let us define the decay parameter $\\lambda = \\frac{f_c}{v_g} - \\frac{f_r}{v_s}$. Then the solution becomes $p_g(x) = A \\exp(-\\lambda x)$.\n\nThe total probability density is $p(x) = p_g(x) + p_s(x) = p_g(x) + \\frac{v_g}{v_s} p_g(x) = (1 + \\frac{v_g}{v_s})p_g(x)$.\n$$ p(x) = A \\left(1 + \\frac{v_g}{v_s}\\right) \\exp(-\\lambda x) $$\nFor this distribution to be normalizable over the domain $x \\in [0, \\infty)$, the integral $\\int_0^\\infty p(x) dx$ must converge to a finite value. This requires the argument of the exponential to be strictly negative, which means $\\lambda > 0$.\nThe condition for the existence of a normalizable steady state is therefore:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{f_c}{v_g} - \\frac{f_r}{v_s} > 0 \\iff f_c v_s > f_r v_g $$\nIf this condition holds, we can determine the constant $A$ by normalizing the total probability to $1$:\n$$ \\int_0^\\infty p(x) dx = \\int_0^\\infty A \\left(1 + \\frac{v_g}{v_s}\\right) \\exp(-\\lambda x) dx = 1 $$\n$$ A \\left(1 + \\frac{v_g}{v_s}\\right) \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\exp(-\\lambda x) \\right]_0^\\infty = 1 $$\n$$ A \\left(1 + \\frac{v_g}{v_s}\\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\right) = 1 \\implies A = \\frac{\\lambda}{1 + v_g/v_s} $$\nSubstituting $A$ back into the expression for $p(x)$ gives the normalized steady-state length distribution:\n$$ p(x) = \\left( \\frac{\\lambda}{1 + v_g/v_s} \\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{v_g}{v_s}\\right) \\exp(-\\lambda x) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda x) $$\nThis is a simple exponential distribution with rate parameter $\\lambda$.\n\nThe mean steady-state microtubule length, $\\bar{L}$, is the expectation value of $x$ for this distribution:\n$$ \\bar{L} = \\langle x \\rangle = \\int_0^\\infty x p(x) dx = \\int_0^\\infty x \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda x) dx $$\nThe mean of an exponential distribution with rate $\\lambda$ is $1/\\lambda$.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires relating a temporal process, GTP hydrolysis, to a spatial distribution, the fluorescence intensity profile. The link between the time domain and the spatial domain is the constant growth velocity of the microtubule, $v_g$.\n\nLet $P(t)$ be the fraction of tubulin subunits that are in the pre-hydrolytic, GTP-bound state at a time $t$ after their incorporation into the microtubule lattice. According to the problem statement, GTP hydrolysis is a first-order process with rate constant $k_h$. The rate of change of the GTP-tubulin fraction is therefore described by the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = -k_h P(t)\n$$\nAt the moment of incorporation into the growing microtubule tip (at $t=0$), all subunits are in the GTP-bound state, so the initial condition is $P(0) = 1$. The solution to this first-order linear ordinary differential equation is an exponential decay function:\n$$\nP(t) = P(0) \\exp(-k_h t) = \\exp(-k_h t)\n$$\nThis equation describes the probability that a tubulin subunit, incorporated at $t=0$, remains in the GTP state at a later time $t$.\n\nThe microtubule plus end grows at a constant speed $v_g$. A segment of the microtubule lattice at a distance $x$ from the growing tip was incorporated at a time $t$ in the past. This time is given by the simple kinematic relation:\n$$\nt = \\frac{x}{v_g}\n$$\nWe can substitute this expression for time into the equation for $P(t)$ to find the fraction of GTP-tubulin as a function of position $x$ from the tip:\n$$\nP(x) = \\exp\\left(-k_h \\frac{x}{v_g}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_h}{v_g} x\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that the EB protein preferentially binds to the pre-hydrolytic state, and that the measured fluorescence intensity, $I(x)$, is proportional to the EB occupancy.

We equate the coefficients of $x$ in the exponents:\n$$\n\\frac{k_h}{v_g} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\n$$\nSolving for the hydrolysis rate constant $k_h$, we obtain the required expression:\n$$\nk_h = \\frac{v_g}{\\lambda}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation part of the problem.\n\nNow, we must compute the numerical value of $k_h$ using the provided data: $v_g = 0.90\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $\\lambda = 0.240\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\nk_h = \\frac{0.90\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.240\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}}\n$$\nThe units of $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ in the numerator and denominator cancel, leaving the unit $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which is correct for a first-order rate constant.

The calculated value $3.75$ already has precisely three significant figures.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.75}\n$$", "id": "2954180"}]}
