It is a straightforward, self-contained, and scientifically sound problem in molecular biophysics.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the equilibrium fraction of polymerized actin, $f$, based on fundamental principles. Let $M$ represent the concentration of free monomeric actin subunits and $P$ represent the concentration of actin subunits incorporated into filaments.\n\nThe first principle is the conservation of total actin. The total concentration of actin subunits, $A_T$, is the sum of the concentrations of subunits in the monomeric and polymeric pools:\n$$A_T = M + P$$\n\nThe second principle is the law of mass action applied to the polymerization reaction at the filament end. The reaction can be written as:\n$$Filament_{n} + Monomer \\rightleftharpoons Filament_{n+1}$$\nwhere $Filament_{n}$ represents a polymer of $n$ subunits. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the rate of subunit addition (association) is equal to the rate of subunit loss (dissociation).\n\nThe rate of association is proportional to the concentration of free monomers, $M$. Let the forward rate constant be $k_{on}$. The rate is $v_{on} = k_{on}M$.\nThe rate of dissociation is an intrinsic property of the filament end and does not depend on the monomer concentration. Let the reverse rate constant be $k_{off}$. The rate is $v_{off} = k_{off}$.\n\nAt equilibrium, $v_{on} = v_{off}$:\n$$k_{on}M_{eq} = k_{off}$$\nwhere $M_{eq}$ is the concentration of free monomers at equilibrium.\n\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K$, is defined as the ratio of the reverse to the forward rate constants, $K = k_{off}/k_{on}$. From the equilibrium condition, we can solve for $M_{eq}$:\n$$M_{eq} = \\frac{k_{off}}{k_{on}} = K$$\nThis equilibrium monomer concentration is also known as the critical concentration, $C_c$. For polymerization to occur ($P > 0$), the total actin concentration $A_T$ must be greater than the critical concentration $K$. If $A_T \\le K$, all actin remains monomeric, and $P=0$.\n\nGiven the values $A_T = 3.0 \\, \\mu M$ and $K = 0.12 \\, \\mu M$, we have $A_T > K$. Therefore, the system will contain both monomers and polymers at equilibrium. The concentration of free monomers will be buffered at the critical concentration, $M_{eq} = K$.\n\nNow, we use the conservation of mass equation at equilibrium:\n$$A_T = M_{eq} + P_{eq}$$\nSubstituting $M_{eq} = K$, we get:\n$$A_T = K + P_{eq}$$\nThis allows us to solve for the equilibrium concentration of polymerized actin, $P_{eq}$:\n$$P_{eq} = A_T - K$$\n\nThe problem asks for the equilibrium fraction of polymerized actin, $f$. This is defined as $f = P/A_T$. At equilibrium, this becomes:\n$$f_{eq} = \\frac{P_{eq}}{A_T}$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $P_{eq}$:\n$$f_{eq} = \\frac{A_T - K}{A_T} = 1 - \\frac{K}{A_T}$$\n\nThis is the general expression for the fraction of polymerized actin at equilibrium when $A_T > K$.\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values: $A_T = 3.0 \\, \\mu M$ and $K = 0.12 \\, \\mu M$.\n$$f = 1 - \\frac{0.12}{3.0}$$\n$$f = 1 - 0.04$$\n$$f = 0.96$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by applying the principles of mass-action kinetics to the actin filament ends. The net rate of subunit addition, $J$, at a filament end is given by the difference between the association rate ($k_{\\mathrm{on}}C$) and the dissociation rate ($k_{\\mathrm{off}}$):\n$$J = k_{\\mathrm{on}}C - k_{\\mathrm{off}}$$\nThe critical concentration, $C_c$, is the monomer concentration at which the net rate of subunit addition is zero ($J=0$), which yields:\n$$C_c = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}$$\nFirst, we calculate the critical concentrations for the barbed end ($C_{c,b}$) and the pointed end ($C_{c,p}$) using the specified rate constants.\nFor the barbed end (ATP-actin):\n$$C_{c,b} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off},b}^{\\mathrm{T}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on},b}} = \\frac{1.40 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{11.6 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1} \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 0.1207 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nFor the pointed end (ADP-actin):\n$$C_{c,p} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off},p}^{\\mathrm{D}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on},p}} = \\frac{0.80 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1.30 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1} \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 0.6154 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nThe given monomer concentration is $C = 0.30 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$.

This is because the concentration of free monomers is sufficient to drive net polymerization at the barbed end ($C > C_{c,b}$) but insufficient to prevent net depolymerization at the pointed end ($C < C_{c,p}$).\n\nNext, we compute the net rate of change in filament length. This requires calculating the net rate of subunit addition at each end.\nThe net rate of subunit addition at the barbed end, $J_b$, is:\n$$J_b = k_{\\mathrm{on},b}C - k_{\\mathrm{off},b}^{\\mathrm{T}} = (11.6 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1} \\mathrm{s}^{-1})(0.30 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}) - 1.40 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n$$J_b = 3.48 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} - 1.40 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 2.08 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe net rate of subunit addition at the pointed end, $J_p$, is:\n$$J_p = k_{\\mathrm{on},p}C - k_{\\mathrm{off},p}^{\\mathrm{D}} = (1.30 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1} \\mathrm{s}^{-1})(0.30 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}) - 0.80 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n$$J_p = 0.39 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} - 0.80 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = -0.41 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe total net rate of change in the number of subunits in the filament, $J_{\\mathrm{net}}$, is the sum of the rates at both ends:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{net}} = J_b + J_p = 2.08 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} - 0.41 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 1.67 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThis positive value indicates a net increase in the total number of subunits in the filament per second.\nFinally, the rate of change of the filament's length, $\\frac{dL}{dt}$, is obtained by multiplying the net subunit addition rate by the axial length per subunit, $d = 2.70 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$:\n$$\\frac{dL}{dt} = J_{\\mathrm{net}} \\times d = (1.67 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (2.70 \\ \\mathrm{nm})$$\n$$\\frac{dL}{dt} = 4.509 \\ \\mathrm{nm} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
