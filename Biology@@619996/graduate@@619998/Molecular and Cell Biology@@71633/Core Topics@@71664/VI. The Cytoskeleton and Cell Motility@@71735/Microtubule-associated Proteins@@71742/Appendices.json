It guides the solver by first asking for the derivation of the basic comet length $L$ before introducing the modification by the MAP. The definitions are unambiguous.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically valid, objective, and well-posed. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe core of this problem rests on translating the temporal description of a biochemical process (hydrolysis) into a spatial distribution along a structure growing at a constant velocity.\n\nFirst, we establish the probability, $P(x)$, that a tubulin subunit at a distance $x$ from the growing microtubule tip remains in the EB-competent state. The problem states that the age, $t$, of a subunit at distance $x$ from the tip is given by:\n$$\nt = \\frac{x}{v_g}\n$$\nThis relation holds because the microtubule is assumed to grow at a constant velocity $v_g$.\n\nThe problem also states that the hydrolysis of the EB-competent state is a first-order, memoryless process. The probability that a subunit survives in this state for a duration $t$ is given by the survival function for a Poisson process:\n$$\nP_{survival}(t) = \\exp(-k_h t)\n$$\nwhere $k_h$ is the rate constant of hydrolysis.\n\nTo find the probability $P(x)$ as a function of distance, we substitute the expression for age $t(x)$ into the survival probability function:\n$$\nP(x) = \\exp\\left(-k_h \\frac{x}{v_g}\\right)\n$$\nThis equation gives the probability profile of the EB-competent state along the microtubule lattice, decaying exponentially from the tip.\n\nThe comet length, $L$, is operationally defined as the mean spatial extent of this EB-competent region, calculated by integrating this probability distribution over all possible distances $x$ from the tip ($x \\ge 0$):\n$$\nL = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} P(x) \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_h}{v_g} x\\right) \\, dx\n$$\nThis is a standard exponential integral. The solution is:\n$$\nL = \\left[ -\\frac{v_g}{k_h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_h}{v_g} x\\right) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty}\n$$\nEvaluating the integral at its limits:\n$$\nL = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\left(-\\frac{v_g}{k_h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_h}{v_g} x\\right)\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{v_g}{k_h} \\exp(0)\\right)\n$$\nSince $k_h > 0$ and $v_g > 0$, the exponential term approaches $0$ as $x \\to \\infty$. The expression becomes:\n$$\nL = 0 - \\left(-\\frac{v_g}{k_h}\\right) = \\frac{v_g}{k_h}\n$$\nThe problem requests an interpretation of this result in terms of a GTP-cap lifetime, $\\tau$. For a first-order decay process with rate constant $k_h$, the mean lifetime of the state is its reciprocal, $\\tau = \\frac{1}{k_h}$. Substituting this into the expression for $L$ yields $L = v_g \\tau$. This has a clear physical interpretation: the average length of the comet is the distance the microtubule tip grows during the average lifetime of one EB-competent (GTP) subunit.\n\nNow, we consider the effect of the MAP. The MAP modifies the hydrolysis rate to $k_h' = \\alpha k_h$, while the growth velocity $v_g$ remains unchanged. We are asked to find the new comet length, $L'$. The derivation follows precisely the same logic as before, but with the rate constant $k_h$ replaced by $k_h'$.\n\nThe new probability distribution is:\n$$\nP'(x) = \\exp\\left(-k_h' \\frac{x}{v_g}\\right)\n$$\nThe new comet length $L'$ is the integral of this new probability distribution:\n$$\nL' = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_h'}{v_g} x\\right) \\, dx\n$$\nSolving this integral in the same manner yields:\n$$\nL' = \\frac{v_g}{k_h'}\n$$\nFinally, we must express $L'$ in terms of the original parameters $v_g$, $k_h$, and the dimensionless factor $\\alpha$. We substitute the given relation $k_h' = \\alpha k_h$:\n$$\nL' = \\frac{v_g}{\\alpha k_h}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the modified comet length. If $\\alpha > 1$, the MAP is a hydrolysis-accelerating factor, which shortens the comet. If $0  \\alpha  1$, the MAP is a hydrolysis-inhibiting factor, which lengthens the comet. The result is dimensionally correct, as $v_g/k_h$ has units of length and $\\alpha$ is dimensionless.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{v_g}{\\alpha k_h}}\n$$", "id": "2954405"}, {"introduction": "Microtubule-associated proteins are key regulators of dynamic instability, the process of switching between growth and shrinkage.

The context and parameters are standard for modeling protein-protein and protein-polymer interactions in cell biology. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to compute the requested dimensionless ratios. The language is objective and precise. No scientific, logical, or formal inconsistencies are detected.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\n**Part 1: Fold-Change in Dissociation Constant ($K_D^{\\mathrm{mut}}/K_D^{\\mathrm{wt}}$)**\n\nThe dissociation constant $K_D$ is related to the standard Gibbs free energy of binding, $\\Delta G^\\circ$, by the fundamental thermodynamic relation:\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ = -k_B T \\ln(K_A) = k_B T \\ln(K_D) $$\nwhere $K_A = 1/K_D$ is the association constant, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe total free energy of binding can be decomposed into an electrostatic component, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{el}}^\\circ$, and a non-electrostatic component, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{non-el}}^\\circ$:\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{non-el}}^\\circ + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{el}}^\\circ $$\n\nThe problem states that the engineered mutant differs from the wild-type only by a change in charge. Therefore, it is assumed that the non-electrostatic contributions to binding are identical for both species: $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{non-el}}^{\\circ, \\mathrm{mut}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{non-el}}^{\\circ, \\mathrm{wt}}$.\n\nThe electrostatic free energy of binding is the work done to move the charged protein repeats from the bulk solution (potential $\\phi_{\\mathrm{bulk}} = 0$) to the microtubule surface (potential $\\psi$). For a protein with effective charge $q$, this energy is $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{el}}^\\circ = q\\psi$.\n\nLet the effective charge of the wild-type tau's binding region be $q_{\\mathrm{wt}} = z_{\\mathrm{wt}} e$, where $z_{\\mathrm{wt}}$ is the number of elementary charges and $e$ is the elementary charge. The mutation removes $\\Delta z = 4$ positive charges, so the charge of the mutant is $q_{\\mathrm{mut}} = (z_{\\mathrm{wt}} - \\Delta z) e$.\n\nThe change in the total binding free energy between the mutant and wild-type is thus purely electrostatic:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ, \\mathrm{mut}} - \\Delta G^{\\circ, \\mathrm{wt}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{el}}^{\\circ, \\mathrm{mut}} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{el}}^{\\circ, \\mathrm{wt}} $$\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ, \\mathrm{mut}} - \\Delta G^{\\circ, \\mathrm{wt}} = q_{\\mathrm{mut}}\\psi - q_{\\mathrm{wt}}\\psi = (q_{\\mathrm{mut}} - q_{\\mathrm{wt}})\\psi $$\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ, \\mathrm{mut}} - \\Delta G^{\\circ, \\mathrm{wt}} = ((z_{\\mathrm{wt}} - \\Delta z)e - z_{\\mathrm{wt}}e)\\psi = -\\Delta z e \\psi $$\n\nUsing the thermodynamic relation for $K_D$:\n$$ k_B T \\ln(K_D^{\\mathrm{mut}}) - k_B T \\ln(K_D^{\\mathrm{wt}}) = k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_D^{\\mathrm{mut}}}{K_D^{\\mathrm{wt}}}\\right) $$\n\nEquating the two expressions for the change in free energy gives:\n$$ k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_D^{\\mathrm{mut}}}{K_D^{\\mathrm{wt}}}\\right) = -\\Delta z e \\psi $$\nSolving for the fold-change in the dissociation constant:\n$$ \\frac{K_D^{\\mathrm{mut}}}{K_D^{\\mathrm{wt}}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta z e \\psi}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nThe argument of the exponential is a dimensionless energy ratio. Substituting the provided values:\n$$ \\frac{-\\Delta z e \\psi}{k_B T} = \\frac{-(4)(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\mathrm{C})(-25 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{V})}{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\mathrm{J/K})(310 \\, \\mathrm{K})} $$\nSince $1 \\text{ V} = 1 \\text{ J/C}$, the units cancel as required.\n$$ \\frac{-\\Delta z e \\psi}{k_B T} = \\frac{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-20} \\, \\mathrm{J}}{4.2799919 \\times 10^{-21} \\, \\mathrm{J}} \\approx 3.743409 $$\nThe fold-change is:\n$$ \\frac{K_D^{\\mathrm{mut}}}{K_D^{\\mathrm{wt}}} = \\exp(3.743409) \\approx 42.2396 $$\n\n**Part 2: Fold-Change in Kinesin-1 Mean Run Length ($L_{\\mathrm{mut}}/L_{\\mathrm{wt}}$)**\n\nThe mean run length $L$ of a motor protein is its average velocity $v$ divided by its total detachment rate constant $k_{\\text{off}}$. A simplifying assumption in such problems, not explicitly contradicted here, is that the motor's stepping velocity $v$ is unaffected by the static obstacles (tau). The intrinsic detachment rate in the absence of tau is $k_{\\mathrm{off},0}$. The run length in the absence of tau is $L_0 = v/k_{\\mathrm{off},0}$.\n\nThe problem states that tau increases the detachment rate by a factor $1 + \\gamma \\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the fractional lattice coverage. The new detachment rate is $k_{\\text{off}} = k_{\\mathrm{off},0}(1 + \\gamma \\theta)$.\nThe run length in the presence of tau is therefore:\n$$ L = \\frac{v}{k_{\\text{off}}} = \\frac{v}{k_{\\mathrm{off},0}(1 + \\gamma \\theta)} = \\frac{L_0}{1 + \\gamma \\theta} $$\n\nTo find the ratio $L_{\\mathrm{mut}}/L_{\\mathrm{wt}}$, we must first calculate the fractional coverage $\\theta$ for both the wild-type and mutant tau conditions. The assumption of noncooperative, one-site binding corresponds to the Langmuir isotherm:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[\\text{protein}]}{[\\text{protein}] + K_D} $$\nHere, the free tau concentration is fixed at $[\\tau] = 100\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n\nFor wild-type tau:\n$K_D^{\\mathrm{wt}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n$$ \\theta_{\\mathrm{wt}} = \\frac{[\\tau]}{[\\tau] + K_D^{\\mathrm{wt}}} = \\frac{100 \\, \\mathrm{nM}}{100 \\, \\mathrm{nM} + 20 \\, \\mathrm{nM}} = \\frac{100}{120} = \\frac{5}{6} $$\n\nFor mutant tau, we first need its dissociation constant $K_D^{\\mathrm{mut}}$:\n$$ K_D^{\\mathrm{mut}} = K_D^{\\mathrm{wt}} \\times \\left(\\frac{K_D^{\\mathrm{mut}}}{K_D^{\\mathrm{wt}}}\\right) = (20 \\, \\mathrm{nM}) \\times (42.2396) \\approx 844.792 \\, \\mathrm{nM} $$\nNow, we calculate the mutant's fractional coverage:\n$$ \\theta_{\\mathrm{mut}} = \\frac{[\\tau]}{[\\tau] + K_D^{\\mathrm{mut}}} = \\frac{100 \\, \\mathrm{nM}}{100 \\, \\mathrm{nM} + 844.792 \\, \\mathrm{nM}} = \\frac{100}{944.792} \\approx 0.105843 $$\n\nThe run lengths for the wild-type and mutant conditions are:\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{wt}} = \\frac{L_0}{1 + \\gamma \\theta_{\\mathrm{wt}}} $$\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{mut}} = \\frac{L_0}{1 + \\gamma \\theta_{\\mathrm{mut}}} $$\n\nThe fold-change in run length is the ratio of these two quantities:\n$$ \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{mut}}}{L_{\\mathrm{wt}}} = \\frac{L_0 / (1 + \\gamma \\theta_{\\mathrm{mut}})}{L_0 / (1 + \\gamma \\theta_{\\mathrm{wt}})} = \\frac{1 + \\gamma \\theta_{\\mathrm{wt}}}{1 + \\gamma \\theta_{\\mathrm{mut}}} $$\nSubstituting the values of $\\gamma=2.5$, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{wt}}=5/6$, and $\\theta_{\\mathrm{mut}} \\approx 0.105843$:\n$$ 1 + \\gamma \\theta_{\\mathrm{wt}} = 1 + (2.5)\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right) = 1 + \\frac{12.5}{6} = \\frac{6 + 12.5}{6} = \\frac{18.5}{6} = \\frac{37}{12} \\approx 3.08333... $$\n$$ 1 + \\gamma \\theta_{\\mathrm{mut}} = 1 + (2.5)(0.105843) \\approx 1 + 0.264608 = 1.264608 $$\nThe final ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{mut}}}{L_{\\mathrm{wt}}} = \\frac{3.08333...}{1.264608} \\approx 2.43813 $$\n\nRounding both results to four significant figures, we have:\n1) $K_D^{\\mathrm{mut}}/K_D^{\\mathrm{wt}} \\approx 42.24$\n2) $L_{\\mathrm{mut}}/L_{\\mathrm{wt}} \\approx 2.438$\nThe final answer is presented as a pair of these two values.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n42.24  2.438\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2954441"}]}
