Take as fundamental constraints: (i) the unloaded velocity at zero opposing force is $v_0$, so $v(F=0)=v_0$, (ii) the stall force $F_s$ is defined by the load at which the average velocity becomes zero, so $v(F=F_s)=0$, and (iii) within the regime from $F=0$ to $F=F_s$ the dependence of $v$ on $F$ is linear due to near-equilibrium linear response of the stepping rate to opposing force. \n\nUsing only these constraints and the definition of stall, first derive the unique linear function $v(F)$ consistent with them.

The system consists of a spherical cargo of radius $R$ moving at a constant velocity $v_{\\text{target}}$ through a viscous fluid. This motion is driven by $N$ active kinesin motors.
