It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, we proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the net mean elongation rate, $\\frac{dn}{dt}$, for a single actin filament barbed end. The process is governed by the reversible reaction:\n$$F_{n} + G \\rightleftharpoons F_{n+1}$$\nwhere $F_{n}$ is an actin filament with $n$ subunits, $G$ is a globular actin (G-actin) monomer, and $F_{n+1}$ is the filament with one additional subunit.\n\nThe problem states that subunit addition and dissociation are independent Poisson processes. The rate of a Poisson process gives the expected number of events per unit time. The net rate of change in the number of subunits, which we denote as the mean elongation rate $\\frac{dn}{dt}$, is the difference between the rate of addition events ($R_{\\text{on}}$) and the rate of dissociation events ($R_{\\text{off}}$).\n$$ \\frac{dn}{dt} = R_{\\text{on}} - R_{\\text{off}} $$\nWe must determine these rates based on mass-action kinetics.\n\nThe forward reaction, $F_{n} + G \\to F_{n+1}$, describes the addition of a G-actin monomer to the filament end. This is a bimolecular reaction. The rate of this reaction for a single filament end is proportional to the concentration of free G-actin, $[G\\text{-actin}]$. The proportionality constant is the on-rate constant, $k_{\\text{on}}^{+}$. Thus, the rate of addition, in units of subunits per second, is:\n$$ R_{\\text{on}} = k_{\\text{on}}^{+} [G\\text{-actin}] $$\nThe units are consistent: $( \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1} ) \\times ( \\mu\\mathrm{M} ) = \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which represents the frequency of association events.\n\nThe reverse reaction, $F_{n+1} \\to F_{n} + G$, describes the dissociation of a subunit from the filament end. This is a unimolecular, or first-order, process. Its rate depends only on the existence of the filament end from which a subunit can dissociate. The rate is given by the off-rate constant, $k_{\\text{off}}^{+}$, which has units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$$ R_{\\text{off}} = k_{\\text{off}}^{+} $$\nThis constant directly represents the frequency of dissociation events.\n\nCombining these two rates, we obtain the general expression for the net mean elongation rate of the barbed end:\n$$ \\frac{dn}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}}^{+} [G\\text{-actin}] - k_{\\text{off}}^{+} $$\nThis is the required expression.\n\nNow, we must evaluate this rate using the provided numerical values:\n$$ k_{\\text{on}}^{+} = 11\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ k_{\\text{off}}^{+} = 1.4\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ [G\\text{-actin}] = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} $$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$ \\frac{dn}{dt} = (11\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) - 1.4\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nFirst, we calculate the addition rate, $R_{\\text{on}}$:\n$$ R_{\\text{on}} = 11 \\times 2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 22\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThe dissociation rate, $R_{\\text{off}}$, is given as:\n$$ R_{\\text{off}} = 1.4\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThe net elongation rate is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{dn}{dt} = 22\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} - 1.4\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 20.6\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThe net elongation rate is $20.6$ subunits per second.\n\nFinally, we must determine the behavior of the filament end based on the sign of this rate. Since $\\frac{dn}{dt} = 20.6 > 0$, the rate is positive. A positive rate signifies that the rate of subunit addition is greater than the rate of subunit dissociation.

Microtubules, with their significant bending rigidity, $\\kappa$, often function as compression-resistant struts essential for cell shape and division. This exercise invites you to model a microtubule as an elastic rod and derive, from the first principles of energy minimization, the critical compressive force, $F_c$, that causes it to buckle.

The condition for stationarity is that the first variation of the energy, $\\delta U_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, must be zero for any admissible small variation $\\delta y(x)$.

Since we are interested in compressive force, we assume $F > 0$. The equation becomes:\n$$y'''' + k^2 y'' = 0$$\nThis is a fourth-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. The characteristic equation is $r^4 + k^2 r^2 = 0$, which factors as $r^2(r^2 + k^2) = 0$. The roots are $r = 0$ with multiplicity $2$, and $r = \\pm ik$. The general solution for $y(x)$ is therefore:\n$$y(x) = C_1 \\sin(kx) + C_2 \\cos(kx) + C_3 x + C_4$$\n\nWe now apply the pinned-pinned boundary conditions:\n$1.$ $y(0) = 0$:\n$$C_1 \\sin(0) + C_2 \\cos(0) + C_3(0) + C_4 = 0 \\implies C_2 + C_4 = 0$$\n$2.$ $y(L) = 0$:\n$$C_1 \\sin(kL) + C_2 \\cos(kL) + C_3 L + C_4 = 0$$\n$3.$ To apply the other boundary conditions, we need the second derivative, $y''(x)$:\n$$y''(x) = -k^2 C_1 \\sin(kx) - k^2 C_2 \\cos(kx)$$\n$y''(0) = 0$:\n$$-k^2 C_1 \\sin(0) - k^2 C_2 \\cos(0) = 0 \\implies -k^2 C_2 = 0$$\nSince we are looking for the buckling condition where $F > 0$, we have $k \\neq 0$.

Again, since $k \\neq 0$, this implies $C_1 \\sin(kL) = 0$.\n\nNow the system of equations for the coefficients has been reduced. We have $C_2=0$ and $C_4=0$. The remaining boundary condition $y(L)=0$ becomes:\n$$C_1 \\sin(kL) + C_3 L = 0$$\nAnd from $y''(L)=0$, we have the condition $C_1 \\sin(kL) = 0$. Substituting this into the previous equation gives $C_3 L = 0$, which implies $C_3 = 0$.\n\nAt this point, we have $C_2=C_3=C_4=0$. The condition $C_1 \\sin(kL) = 0$ remains.\nIf we set $C_1=0$, then all coefficients are zero, leading to the trivial solution $y(x) = 0$, which represents the unbuckled state. For a non-trivial solution (buckling) to exist, we must have $C_1 \\neq 0$.
