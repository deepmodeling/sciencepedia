Consider one half of the minifilament that presents $N$ identical myosin heads to the actin. Each head is modeled as a two-state process that alternates between an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-free, strongly bound state and an ATP-bound, detached state. Let the average dwell time in the bound state be $t_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and in the detached state be $t_{\\mathrm{off}}$. The duty ratio $f$ is defined as the long-time fraction of the mechanochemical cycle spent in the bound state, $f = t_{\\mathrm{on}}/(t_{\\mathrm{on}} + t_{\\mathrm{off}})$. Assume the following:\n- Stationarity and ergodicity hold so that the duty ratio equals the instantaneous probability that a single head is bound at a randomly sampled time.\n- Heads act independently; that is, the bound/unbound state of one head does not alter the transition statistics of another at the time scales considered.\n- The actin filament is continuously available for binding and there is no steric exclusion at the measured duty ratio.\n\nUnder these assumptions, at a randomly sampled time in steady state, compute the probability that at least one head is bound to actin for $N = 30$ and $f = 0.05$.

The analysis begins with a validation of the problem statement, which is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The two-state model for myosin heads is a standard simplification in biophysics, and the provided parameters are realistic.\n\nLet $p$ be the probability that a single myosin head is in the bound state at any given instant. The problem states that the duty ratio, $f$, which is the fraction of time a head spends in the bound state, is equal to this probability due to the assumptions of stationarity and ergodicity.\n$$p = f$$\nThe probability that a single head is in the unbound (detached) state is the complement of $p$, which we denote as $q$.\n$$q = 1 - p = 1 - f$$\n\nWe have a system of $N$ identical myosin heads. A critical assumption provided is that these heads act independently. This means that the binding state of one head has no influence on the binding state of any other head. Therefore, the state of the ensemble of $N$ heads can be described by a set of $N$ independent Bernoulli trials, where the probability of success (a head being bound) for each trial is $p=f$.\n\nThe objective is to find the probability of the event that *at least one* head is bound. A direct calculation would require summing the probabilities of exactly $k$ heads being bound for all $k$ from $1$ to $N$. Using the binomial probability mass function, this would be:\n$$P(\\text{at least one bound}) = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\binom{N}{k} p^k (1-p)^{N-k}$$\nThis approach is unnecessarily laborious. A more direct and logical method is to calculate the probability of the complementary event, which is that *no* heads are bound, or equivalently, that *all* $N$ heads are simultaneously in the unbound state. Let us denote this event by $E_0$.\n\nBecause the heads are independent, the probability of all $N$ heads being unbound is the product of their individual probabilities of being unbound.\n$$P(E_0) = P(\\text{all } N \\text{ heads are unbound}) = q^N = (1-f)^N$$\n\nThe event 'at least one head is bound' is the logical complement to the event 'no heads are bound'. Therefore, the sum of their probabilities must be equal to $1$. Let $P_{\\ge 1}$ be the probability that at least one head is bound.\n$$P_{\\ge 1} + P(E_0) = 1$$\nFrom this, we derive the general expression for the desired probability:\n$$P_{\\ge 1} = 1 - P(E_0) = 1 - (1-f)^N$$\n\nNow, we substitute the specific numerical values given in the problem statement: the number of heads is $N = 30$, and the duty ratio is $f = 0.05$.\n$$P_{\\ge 1} = 1 - (1 - 0.05)^{30}$$\n$$P_{\\ge 1} = 1 - (0.95)^{30}$$\nWe must now evaluate this numerical expression.\n$$(0.95)^{30} \\approx 0.21463876$$\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $P_{\\ge 1}$:\n$$P_{\\ge 1} \\approx 1 - 0.21463876$$\n$$P_{\\ge 1} \\approx 0.78536124$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P_{\\ge 1} \\approx 0.7854$$\nThis result demonstrates the principle of avidity in biological systems.
