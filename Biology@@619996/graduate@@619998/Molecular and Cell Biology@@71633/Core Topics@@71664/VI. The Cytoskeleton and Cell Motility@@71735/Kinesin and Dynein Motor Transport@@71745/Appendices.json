Kinesin-1 binds to the $\\beta$-tubulin binding site on a single protofilament and advances processively by alternating its two heads between successive $\\beta$-tubulin binding sites along the same protofilament. Assume the following structural facts as the fundamental base: (i) along a single protofilament, the axial extent of an $\\alpha$-tubulin monomer is $l_{\\alpha}$ and that of a $\\beta$-tubulin monomer is $l_{\\beta}$, arranged in a head-to-tail sequence $\\cdots \\alpha \\beta \\alpha \\beta \\cdots$; (ii) the relevant longitudinal binding site for kinesin-1 is the $\\beta$-tubulin subunit; (iii) in the hand-over-hand mechanism, a single mechanochemical cycle powered by one hydrolysis of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) advances a head from one $\\beta$-tubulin site to the next $\\beta$-tubulin site along the same protofilament; (iv) lateral registry between protofilaments and the lattice seam do not alter the axial spacing along a single protofilament.

It presents a simplified but internally consistent model of a microtubule protofilament and the stepping mechanism of kinesin-1, based on established principles in molecular biophysics. All necessary parameters are provided, and the objective is clearly defined. Therefore, proceeding with a solution is justified.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the canonical kinesin step size based on a simplified structural model of a microtubule protofilament. The protofilament is described as a one-dimensional, linear polymer formed by the head-to-tail assembly of $\\alpha$-tubulin and $\\beta$-tubulin monomers. Let the axial length of an $\\alpha$-tubulin monomer be $l_{\\alpha}$ and that of a $\\beta$-tubulin monomer be $l_{\\beta}$. The sequence of monomers along the protofilament is given as an alternating chain: $\\cdots \\alpha \\beta \\alpha \\beta \\cdots$.\n\nThe fundamental repeating structural unit in this one-dimensional lattice is the $\\alpha\\beta$-tubulin dimer. The length of this dimer, $L_{\\text{dimer}}$, is the sum of the lengths of its constituent monomers:\n$$L_{\\text{dimer}} = l_{\\alpha} + l_{\\beta}$$\nThe problem states that kinesin-1 binds specifically to the $\\beta$-tubulin subunits. These subunits therefore constitute the binding sites for the motor protein. We are asked to find the longitudinal periodicity of these binding sites.\n\nConsider the linear arrangement of monomers along the protofilament axis. Let us establish an arbitrary origin. The positions of the $\\beta$-tubulin subunits define a periodic lattice of binding sites. The distance between any two consecutive $\\beta$-tubulin subunits is the period of this lattice. To move from a specific point on one $\\beta$-tubulin subunit to the corresponding point on the next $\\beta$-tubulin subunit in the sequence, one must traverse the full length of that $\\beta$-tubulin ($l_{\\beta}$) and the full length of the adjacent $\\alpha$-tubulin ($l_{\\alpha}$) that separates it from the next $\\beta$-tubulin.\n\nThus, the longitudinal periodicity of the binding sites, which we denote as $d$, is equal to the length of one $\\alpha\\beta$-tubulin dimer.\n$$d = l_{\\alpha} + l_{\\beta}$$\nThe problem defines the canonical kinesin step size, $s$, as the distance a single kinesin head advances along the protofilament during one mechanochemical cycle, which is powered by the hydrolysis of one ATP molecule. It is explicitly stated that this cycle advances a head from one $\\beta$-tubulin site to the *next* $\\beta$-tubulin site. This directly implies that the step size $s$ is equal to the periodicity $d$ of the binding sites.\n$$s = d = l_{\\alpha} + l_{\\beta}$$\nThe problem provides the numerical values for the monomer lengths: $l_{\\alpha} = 4.00 \\text{ nm}$ and $l_{\\beta} = 4.00 \\text{ nm}$. Substituting these values into our derived expression for the step size:\n$$s = 4.00 \\text{ nm} + 4.00 \\text{ nm} = 8.00 \\text{ nm}$$\nThe input values are given to three significant figures (two decimal places). According to the rules of addition for significant figures, the result should be reported to the same number of decimal places as the measurement with the fewest decimal places. In this case, both inputs have two decimal places, so the result is $8.00 \\text{ nm}$. This number has three significant figures, which satisfies the requirement of the problem statement.

This practice bridges the gap between discrete mechanical steps and the continuous, average velocity of the motor. You will apply a core concept from enzyme kinetics—the single rate-limiting step approximation—to a motor's chemomechanical cycle to see how macroscopic velocity ($v$) emerges directly from the step size ($d$) and the rate ($k_{\\text{rl}}$) of the cycle's slowest transition [@problem_id:2950553].", "problem": "A dimeric kinesin moving along a microtubule advances by one mechanical step of size $d$ for each completed chemomechanical cycle that hydrolyzes one molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

It presents a simplified but standard model of a molecular motor, which is well-posed and admits a unique solution. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe mean velocity, which we denote as $v$, is defined as the mean displacement per unit time.

Therefore, the motor operates at its maximal intrinsic velocity, $v_{\\text{max}}$.\n$$v_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{d}{\\langle \\tau_{\\text{cycle}} \\rangle}$$\nThe problem makes a critical simplifying assumption: the entire chemomechanical cycle contains a single, irreversible, rate-limiting transition governed by a first-order rate constant, $k_{\\text{rl}}$. All other transitions in the cycle are posited to be much faster, and thus their contribution to the total mean cycle time is negligible.\n\nThis simplification is paramount. The kinetics of a sequential process are governed by the slowest step, which acts as a bottleneck. A process defined by a first-order rate constant, such as the rate-limiting step here, is a stochastic Poisson process. The waiting time for the event to occur is an exponentially distributed random variable. It is a fundamental result of stochastic kinetics that the mean waiting time, $\\langle \\tau_{\\text{rl}} \\rangle$, for a process with a first-order rate constant $k_{\\text{rl}}$ is the reciprocal of that rate constant.\n$$\\langle \\tau_{\\text{rl}} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{rl}}}$$\nGiven that all other steps in the cycle are much faster, their mean durations are insignificant compared to $\\langle \\tau_{\\text{rl}} \\rangle$.

The unit of length in SI is the meter ($m$).

Second, we will use this expression in conjunction with the provided experimental data and the assumption of a linear force-velocity relationship to extrapolate to the zero-load velocity, $v_0$.\n\nThe motion of the bead is governed by the principles of low Reynolds number hydrodynamics. In this regime, inertial forces are negligible, and the sum of all forces acting on the bead must be zero at all times. The force balance equation along the axis of the microtubule is:\n$$\n\\sum F = F_{\\mathrm{motor}} + F_{\\mathrm{trap}} + F_{\\mathrm{drag}} = 0\n$$\nHere, forces are defined as positive in the direction of motor-driven motion.\n\nThe forces are specified as follows:\n$1$. The trap force, $F_{\\mathrm{trap}}$, is described by Hooke's Law. The optical trap exerts a restoring force proportional to the displacement $x$ of the bead from the trap's center. This force opposes the displacement. Thus, $F_{\\mathrm{trap}} = -kx$, where $k$ is the trap stiffness.\n\n$2$. The hydrodynamic drag force, $F_{\\mathrm{drag}}$, opposes the motion of the bead relative to the surrounding fluid. The velocity of the bead is $v_b$ and the background fluid velocity is $u$. The relative velocity is $v_{\\mathrm{rel}} = v_b - u$. The drag force is given by $F_{\\mathrm{drag}} = -\\gamma v_{\\mathrm{rel}} = -\\gamma(v_b - u)$, where $\\gamma$ is the drag coefficient.\n\nSubstituting these into the force balance equation yields:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{motor}} - kx - \\gamma(v_b - u) = 0\n$$\nFrom this, we derive the expression for the instantaneous motor force:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{motor}} = kx + \\gamma(v_b - u)\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the motor force.\n\nThe drag coefficient, $\\gamma$, must account for the proximity of the bead to the surface (the \"wall\"). For a sphere of radius $a$ translating parallel to a plane wall at a height $h$ (from center to wall), the drag coefficient $\\gamma$ is the bulk Stokes drag coefficient, $\\gamma_0 = 6 \\pi \\eta a$, multiplied by a correction factor.

The intrinsic force-velocity relationship for the motor is assumed to be linear:\n$$\nv_b = v_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{motor}}}{F_s}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $v_0$ is the zero-load velocity and $F_s$ is the stall force. This equation describes a straight line in the $(F_{\\mathrm{motor}}, v_b)$ plane.
