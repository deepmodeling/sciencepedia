Use the following fundamental and well-tested facts as your base: (i) the α–β tubulin heterodimer is polar and assembles head-to-tail along protofilaments with distinct minus-end (α-tubulin facing the minus end) and plus-end (β-tubulin facing the plus end) orientations; (ii) a B-lattice microtubule has predominantly homotypic lateral contacts (α–α and β–β) between adjacent protofilaments with a single α–β seam upon closure, whereas an A-lattice microtubule has predominantly heterotypic α–β lateral contacts; (iii) wild-type γ-tubulin in the γ-TuRC binds the minus-end face of α-tubulin with substantially higher affinity than it binds β-tubulin; (iv) the γ-TuRC presents approximately $13$ binding sites around a ring, separated by an azimuthal angle of roughly $360^\\circ/13$, and positions the first layer of α–β heterodimers with small axial variation between adjacent sites, so that the axial offset $\\Delta z$ between neighboring protofilaments at the nucleation interface is near $0$ relative to the heterodimer length $L$; (v) the heterodimer repeat length is approximately $L\\approx 8\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, so that an A-lattice lateral registry corresponds to an axial offset of roughly $\\Delta z\\approx L/2$ between neighbors, while a B-lattice registry corresponds to $\\Delta z\\approx 0$ between neighbors.

Choose the single best statement.\n\nA. No. Because γ-tubulin binds α-tubulin strongly at the minus end and arranges adjacent sites with $\\Delta z\\approx 0$, the initial α–β dimers are laterally poised for homotypic α–α and β–β contacts (B-lattice). Achieving an A-lattice would require $\\Delta z\\approx L/2$ between neighbors, which would either force unfavorable β–γ end-on binding or break the uniform γ–α registry around the ring, incurring a global energetic penalty.\n\nB. Yes. A small global twist or flex of the γ-TuRC could impose $\\Delta z\\approx L/2$ between adjacent binding sites without altering which subunit (α versus β) engages γ-tubulin, thereby producing α–β lateral contacts (A-lattice) while preserving favorable γ–α end-on interactions.\n\nC. Yes. Because lattice identity is determined exclusively during later elongation by guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis, any initial registry imposed by the γ-TuRC is irrelevant; thus an A-lattice can emerge even if the template specifies $\\Delta z\\approx 0$ at nucleation.\n\nD. No. Microtubules cannot form A-lattices under any conditions; therefore a γ-TuRC cannot, in principle, template an A-lattice regardless of geometry or affinity considerations.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation before a solution is attempted.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\nThe provided premises are:\n(i) The $\\alpha$–$\\beta$ tubulin heterodimer is polar. The minus-end exposes $\\alpha$-tubulin, and the plus-end exposes $\\beta$-tubulin. Assembly is head-to-tail.\n(ii) A B-lattice microtubule features predominantly homotypic lateral contacts ($\\alpha$–$\\alpha$ and $\\beta$–$\\beta$). An A-lattice microtubule features predominantly heterotypic lateral contacts ($\\alpha$–$\\beta$).\n(iii) Wild-type $\\gamma$-tubulin in the $\\gamma$-Tubulin Ring Complex ($\\gamma$-TuRC) has a substantially higher binding affinity for the minus-end face of $\\alpha$-tubulin than for $\\beta$-tubulin.\n(iv) The $\\gamma$-TuRC has approximately $13$ binding sites in a ring, with an azimuthal separation of roughly $360^\\circ/13$. It positions the first layer of $\\alpha$–$\\beta$ heterodimers with a small axial offset, $\\Delta z$, between adjacent sites, such that $\\Delta z \\approx 0$ relative to the heterodimer length $L$.\n(v) The heterodimer repeat length is $L \\approx 8\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. An A-lattice corresponds to an axial offset of $\\Delta z \\approx L/2$ between adjacent protofilaments. A B-lattice corresponds to an axial offset of $\\Delta z \\approx 0$.\n(vi) The system is a $13$-protofilament microtubule and a wild-type $\\gamma$-TuRC.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, relying on established principles of cytoskeletal biology, specifically microtubule structure and nucleation. The definitions of A- and B-lattices, the polarity of tubulin dimers, the specificity of $\\gamma$-tubulin for $\\alpha$-tubulin, and the templating role of the $\\gamma$-TuRC are all consistent with current scientific understanding. The problem is well-posed, providing a self-contained set of facts from which a logical deduction can be made. The language is objective and precise. The premises are not contradictory but instead set up the central logical puzzle to be solved: the conflict between the $\\gamma$-TuRC's native geometry ($\\Delta z \\approx 0$) and the requirement for an A-lattice ($\\Delta z \\approx L/2$).\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe question asks whether a wild-type $\\gamma$-TuRC can template an A-lattice at the point of nucleation. We must synthesize the provided facts to answer this.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Role of the $\\gamma$-TuRC**: The $\\gamma$-TuRC serves as a template for the minus end of the microtubule. According to premise (iii), $\\gamma$-tubulin binds with high affinity to $\\alpha$-tubulin. This establishes a specific interaction, $\\gamma$-$\\alpha$, at the base of each new protofilament.\n\n2.  **Geometry of the $\\gamma$-TuRC Template**: Premise (iv) states that the $\\gamma$-TuRC arranges its $13$ binding sites as a ring with minimal axial variation between them. This means the axial offset between adjacent binding sites, and thus between the initial $\\alpha$-tubulins they recruit, is approximately zero ($\\Delta z \\approx 0$). The $\\gamma$-TuRC can be visualized as a nearly flat washer-like structure.\n\n3.  **Lattice Structure and Axial Offset**: Premise (v) explicitly links the axial offset, $\\Delta z$, between adjacent protofilaments to the resulting lattice type. An offset of $\\Delta z \\approx 0$ results in a B-lattice, characterized by homotypic lateral contacts ($\\alpha$–$\\alpha$ and $\\beta$–$\\beta$). An offset of $\\Delta z \\approx L/2$ results in an A-lattice, characterized by heterotypic lateral contacts ($\\alpha$–$\\beta$).\n\n4.  **Synthesis and Logical Conclusion**: By combining these facts, we can determine the lattice type templated by the wild-type $\\gamma$-TuRC. The $\\gamma$-TuRC enforces $\\gamma$-$\\alpha$ binding at all $13$ sites (premise iii) and arranges these binding sites with $\\Delta z \\approx 0$ (premise iv). This forces the first ring of $\\alpha$-tubulins to be co-planar, establishing an initial inter-protofilament offset of $\\Delta z \\approx 0$. According to premise (v), this specific geometry ($\\Delta z \\approx 0$) directly corresponds to the formation of a B-lattice.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the A-lattice Possibility**: To template an A-lattice, the $\\gamma$-TuRC would need to establish an axial offset of $\\Delta z \\approx L/2$ between adjacent protofilaments. Given the problem's constraints, we must evaluate how this could be achieved.\n    *   **Possibility 1: The $\\gamma$-TuRC itself deforms.** The template could adopt a helical \"lock-washer\" conformation where adjacent binding sites are displaced by $\\Delta z = L/2 \\approx 4\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. This contradicts premise (iv), which specifies \"small axial variation\" where $\\Delta z \\approx 0$. An offset of $4\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ is not \"small\" compared to the dimer size of $8\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n    *   **Possibility 2: The binding specificity is violated.** To create a stagger of $\\Delta z \\approx L/2$ with a flat template ($\\Delta z_{template} \\approx 0$), one might imagine alternating the bound subunit. For example, site $i$ binds $\\alpha$-tubulin, and site $i+1$ binds $\\beta$-tubulin. This would create an offset, but it directly violates two premises: premise (iii), which states $\\gamma$-tubulin has a strong preference for $\\alpha$-tubulin, making a $\\gamma$-$\\beta$ interaction highly unfavorable energetically; and premise (i), which defines the minus end as exposing $\\alpha$-tubulin, so binding a $\\beta$-tubulin would imply an incorrect orientation of the dimer.\n\nTherefore, the structure and binding properties of the wild-type $\\gamma$-TuRC, as defined in the problem, are fundamentally incompatible with templating an A-lattice. The system is geometrically and energetically poised to template a B-lattice.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. No. Because γ-tubulin binds α-tubulin strongly at the minus end and arranges adjacent sites with $\\Delta z\\approx 0$, the initial α–β dimers are laterally poised for homotypic α–α and β–β contacts (B-lattice). Achieving an A-lattice would require $\\Delta z\\approx L/2$ between neighbors, which would either force unfavorable β–γ end-on binding or break the uniform γ–α registry around the ring, incurring a global energetic penalty.**\nThis statement correctly synthesizes the key facts. It correctly links the $\\gamma$-$\\alpha$ specificity and the $\\Delta z \\approx 0$ geometry to the formation of a B-lattice. It correctly identifies the A-lattice requirement of $\\Delta z \\approx L/2$. Finally, it correctly deduces the consequences of forcing an A-lattice: either violating the template's flat geometry (which it describes as breaking the uniform registry) or violating the binding specificity (unfavorable $\\beta$-$\\gamma$ binding). This reasoning is sound and directly follows from the premises.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Yes. A small global twist or flex of the γ-TuRC could impose $\\Delta z\\approx L/2$ between adjacent binding sites without altering which subunit (α versus β) engages γ-tubulin, thereby producing α–β lateral contacts (A-lattice) while preserving favorable γ–α end-on interactions.**\nThis statement claims a \"small\" flex could produce the required offset. However, the required offset is $\\Delta z \\approx L/2 \\approx 4\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, which is a large, periodic structural change, not a \"small global twist or flex\". This contradicts premise (iv), which states the axial variation is small ($\\Delta z \\approx 0$).\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Yes. Because lattice identity is determined exclusively during later elongation by guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis, any initial registry imposed by the γ-TuRC is irrelevant; thus an A-lattice can emerge even if the template specifies $\\Delta z\\approx 0$ at nucleation.**\nThis statement dismisses the central premise of the problem: that the $\\gamma$-TuRC acts as a template that imposes an initial registry. Premise (iv) explicitly states the $\\gamma$-TuRC \"positions the first layer of $\\alpha$–$\\beta$ heterodimers\". To claim this action is \"irrelevant\" is to discard the problem's own factual basis. The question is about what the $\\gamma$-TuRC *can template*, not what might happen later during elongation.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. No. Microtubules cannot form A-lattices under any conditions; therefore a γ-TuRC cannot, in principle, template an A-lattice regardless of geometry or affinity considerations.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. Premise (ii) defines both A- and B-lattices, implying their existence as possible structures. While the B-lattice is more common for cytoplasmic microtubules, the A-lattice is a known structural variant. The argument's premise is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2953977"}, {"introduction": "Building on the $\\gamma$-TuRC's role as a template, this practice delves into how its function is controlled within the complex environment of the cell.

Phosphorylation at this site promotes release of $\\gamma$-TuRC from PCM, decreasing centrosomal docking in the phospho-mimetic mutant and increasing cytosolic nucleation efficiency to compensate.", "solution": "We begin from three foundational points. First, centrosomal microtubule nucleation is mediated by pericentriolar material (PCM)-docked $\\gamma$-tubulin ring complex ($\\gamma$-TuRC) particles. Second, the total nucleation output of an MTOC in a given time interval is proportional to the number of docked $\\gamma$-TuRC particles, here denoted $N_{\\text{bound}}$, times the average nucleation rate per docked particle, denoted $k_{\\text{nuc}}$. Thus, if $k_{\\text{nuc}}$ is unchanged, changes in output reflect changes in $N_{\\text{bound}}$. Third, protein phosphorylation often regulates binding affinity to scaffolds (affecting $N_{\\text{bound}}$) without necessarily altering the catalytic performance of a complex (affecting $k_{\\text{nuc}}$).\n\nWe now interpret each measurement in light of these principles:\n\n1. Centrosomal $\\gamma$-tubulin intensity serves as a proxy for $N_{\\text{bound}}$. The values WT $= 100$, S$\\rightarrow$A $= 40$, and S$\\rightarrow$E $= 180$ indicate that S$\\rightarrow$A reduces and S$\\rightarrow$E increases $N_{\\text{bound}}$ relative to WT.\n\n2.

Increased PCM area typically provides more docking capacity for $\\gamma$-TuRC, consistent with higher $N_{\\text{bound}}$ in S$\\rightarrow$E, and the converse for S$\\rightarrow$A.\n\n3. The TIRF single-particle nucleation assay directly estimates $k_{\\text{nuc}}$, with WT $= 1.00$, S$\\rightarrow$A $= 0.98$, S$\\rightarrow$E $= 1.05$ events per particle per minute. These are essentially indistinguishable within experimental variability, arguing that intrinsic per-particle catalytic nucleation activity is not materially changed by either mutation.\n\n4. FRAP measurements of $\\gamma$-TuRC turnover at centrosomes (mobile fraction WT $= 0.50$, S$\\rightarrow$A $= 0.80$, S$\\rightarrow$E $= 0.30$) indicate that S$\\rightarrow$E strengthens binding (lower mobile fraction, longer residence), while S$\\rightarrow$A weakens binding (higher mobile fraction, shorter residence). This directly implicates phosphorylation as a positive regulator of PCM docking stability.\n\n5. Cold-induced regrowth yields WT $= 1000$, S$\\rightarrow$A $= 400$, S$\\rightarrow$E $= 1800$ microtubules per centrosome after $2\\,\\text{min}$. These totals scale with centrosomal $\\gamma$-tubulin intensity (proxy for $N_{\\text{bound}}$): the ratios S$\\rightarrow$A:WT:S$\\rightarrow$E are approximately $40:100:180$ for intensity and $400:1000:1800$ for microtubule number, consistent with similar $k_{\\text{nuc}}$ but different $N_{\\text{bound}}$.\n\n6. Cytosolic $\\gamma$-TuRC abundance and assembly state are indistinguishable across genotypes, ruling out a defect in particle assembly or total supply.\n\nWe can formalize the consistency check. Let $N_{\\text{bound}}^{\\text{WT}} \\propto 100$, $N_{\\text{bound}}^{\\text{S}\\rightarrow\\text{A}} \\propto 40$, $N_{\\text{bound}}^{\\text{S}\\rightarrow\\text{E}} \\propto 180$.

This alignment strongly supports a docking-based mechanism.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. Phosphorylation increases affinity for PCM scaffolds, increasing $N_{\\text{bound}}$ without changing $k_{\\text{nuc}}$. This matches all observations: higher centrosomal $\\gamma$-tubulin and PCM area in S$\\rightarrow$E, lower in S$\\rightarrow$A; unchanged per-particle nucleation in TIRF; FRAP indicates stabilized binding in S$\\rightarrow$E and destabilized binding in S$\\rightarrow$A; microtubule regrowth scales with $N_{\\text{bound}}$. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. Phosphorylation reduces intrinsic $k_{\\text{nuc}}$ while leaving docking unaffected. This is contradicted by TIRF data (per-particle rates are unchanged) and by changes in centrosomal $\\gamma$-tubulin intensity and FRAP that demonstrate altered docking. If docking were unaffected, centrosomal intensity and PCM residency would be similar across genotypes, which is not observed. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. Phosphorylation disrupts cytosolic $\\gamma$-TuRC assembly, lowering particle abundance. Size-exclusion chromatography shows indistinguishable cytosolic assembly and abundance across genotypes, arguing against this. Moreover, the coordinated changes in FRAP and centrosomal intensity are docking phenomena, not assembly defects. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. Phosphorylation promotes release from PCM, decreasing $N_{\\text{bound}}$ in the phospho-mimetic and increasing cytosolic nucleation. The data show the opposite: S$\\rightarrow$E has increased centrosomal intensity, larger PCM area, reduced mobile fraction (stronger retention), and higher total nucleation output at centrosomes. No increase in cytosolic activity is observed in TIRF beyond small, likely noise-level differences. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation is that phosphorylation at the tested site enhances PCM docking/retention of $\\gamma$-TuRC (or its associated $\\gamma$-tubulin complex proteins), thereby tuning nucleation output by changing the number of docked complexes rather than their per-particle activity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2954055"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the $\\gamma$-TuRC's structure and regulation, we now scale up our analysis to the level of an entire organelle.

The mean lifetime $\\tau$ is the average time a microtubule exists from its nucleation until its complete disappearance.
