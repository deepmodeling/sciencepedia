The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and a clear objective: to calculate a specific concentration, $[\\mathrm{Cap}]$, that satisfies a physically meaningful steady-state condition. The language is objective and quantitative. The problem is self-contained and does not contain internal contradictions. It is not trivial, as it requires the derivation of a steady-state equation from first principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A rigorous solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds by establishing the kinetic equations for each end of the actin filament and solving for the condition of zero net growth in average filament length.\n\nFirst, we analyze the barbed-end capping dynamics. The barbed end exists in two states: uncapped ($U$) and capped ($C$). The transition between these states is governed by a reversible reaction:\n$$ U + \\text{Cap} \\underset{k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}}}{\\stackrel{k_{\\mathrm{cap,on}}[\\mathrm{Cap}]}{\\rightleftharpoons}} C $$\nLet $P_U$ and $P_C$ be the probabilities (or steady-state fractions of time) that the barbed end is uncapped and capped, respectively. At steady state for the capping reaction, the rate of capping must equal the rate of uncapping:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{cap,on}}[\\mathrm{Cap}] P_U = k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}} P_C $$\nGiven that the probabilities must sum to unity, $P_U + P_C = 1$, we can write $P_C = 1 - P_U$. Substituting this into the equilibrium condition gives:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{cap,on}}[\\mathrm{Cap}] P_U = k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}} (1 - P_U) $$\nSolving for $P_U$:\n$$ (k_{\\mathrm{cap,on}}[\\mathrm{Cap}] + k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}}) P_U = k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}} $$\n$$ P_U = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cap,on}}[\\mathrm{Cap}] + k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}}} $$\nThis expression gives the fraction of time the barbed end is available for growth.\n\nNext, we define the net rates of subunit addition at each end. The rates are given in subunits per second.\nThe net rate of subunit addition at the barbed end, $J_b$, is non-zero only when it is uncapped. When capped, the rate is zero. The time-averaged net rate, $\\langle J_b \\rangle$, is therefore:\n$$ \\langle J_b \\rangle = (k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{b}[A_T] - k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{b}) P_U + (0) P_C = (k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{b}[A_T] - k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{b}) P_U $$\nThe net rate of subunit addition at the pointed end, $J_p$, is independent of the barbed end state. It is given by:\n$$ J_p = k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{p}[A_D] - k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{p,\\mathrm{eff}} $$\nUsing the provided definition for the effective pointed-end dissociation rate, $k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{p,\\mathrm{eff}} = k_{\\mathrm{off},0}^{p} + k_{\\mathrm{tw}}[\\mathrm{Twf}]$, we have:\n$$ J_p = k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{p}[A_D] - (k_{\\mathrm{off},0}^{p} + k_{\\mathrm{tw}}[\\mathrm{Twf}]) $$\n\nThe problem defines the treadmilling steady state as the condition where the average filament length is constant. This requires the total net rate of change of length, which is the sum of the rates at both ends, to be zero:\n$$ \\frac{d\\langle L \\rangle}{dt} = \\langle J_b \\rangle + J_p = 0 $$\nThis implies that the time-averaged net addition at the barbed end must exactly balance the net loss at the pointed end:\n$$ \\langle J_b \\rangle = -J_p $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\langle J_b \\rangle$ and $J_p$:\n$$ (k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{b}[A_T] - k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{b}) P_U = -(k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{p}[A_D] - (k_{\\mathrm{off},0}^{p} + k_{\\mathrm{tw}}[\\mathrm{Twf}])) $$\n$$ (k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{b}[A_T] - k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{b}) P_U = k_{\\mathrm{off},0}^{p} + k_{\\mathrm{tw}}[\\mathrm{Twf}] - k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{p}[A_D] $$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $P_U$:\n$$ (k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{b}[A_T] - k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{b}) \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cap,on}}[\\mathrm{Cap}] + k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}}} \\right) = k_{\\mathrm{off},0}^{p} + k_{\\mathrm{tw}}[\\mathrm{Twf}] - k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{p}[A_D] $$\nWe must now solve this equation for the unknown capping protein concentration, $[\\mathrm{Cap}]$. Let us define the net uncapped barbed-end growth rate as $\\Delta J_b = k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{b}[A_T] - k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{b}$ and the net pointed-end loss rate as $\\Delta J_p^{\\mathrm{loss}} = k_{\\mathrm{off},0}^{p} + k_{\\mathrm{tw}}[\\mathrm{Twf}] - k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{p}[A_D]$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\Delta J_b \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cap,on}}[\\mathrm{Cap}] + k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}}} \\right) = \\Delta J_p^{\\mathrm{loss}} $$\nRearranging to solve for $[\\mathrm{Cap}]$:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta J_b}{\\Delta J_p^{\\mathrm{loss}}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cap,on}}[\\mathrm{Cap}] + k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}}} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta J_b}{\\Delta J_p^{\\mathrm{loss}}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cap,on}}[\\mathrm{Cap}]}{k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}}} + 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cap,on}}[\\mathrm{Cap}]}{k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}}} = \\frac{\\Delta J_b}{\\Delta J_p^{\\mathrm{loss}}} - 1 $$\n$$ [\\mathrm{Cap}] = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cap,off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cap,on}}} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta J_b}{\\Delta J_p^{\\mathrm{loss}}} - 1 \\right) $$\nThis is the final analytical expression for $[\\mathrm{Cap}]$.\n\nNow we substitute the numerical values provided.

It is self-contained and free of contradictions. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the steady shortening of the actomyosin network is the balance of forces. In an overdamped system, inertial forces are zero. At steady state, the total active force generated by the myosin motors, $F_{\\mathrm{motor}}$, must be exactly balanced by the total dissipative drag force, $F_{\\mathrm{drag}}$.\n$$F_{\\mathrm{motor}} = F_{\\mathrm{drag}}$$\nFirst, we formulate the expression for the total drag force. The problem states that the network of length $L$ experiences a drag force proportional to its shortening speed $V$, with a drag coefficient per unit length $\\xi$. Therefore, the total drag force is given by:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{drag}} = \\xi L V$$\nNext, we formulate the total active force generated by the myosin minifilaments. The minifilaments are uniformly distributed with a linear density $\\rho_{m}$. For a network of length $L$, the total number of minifilaments, $N_{\\mathrm{total}}$, is:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\rho_{m} L$$\nThe problem specifies a mean-field assumption of equal load sharing, meaning each minifilament experiences the same load force, $f$. The total active force is the force per motor multiplied by the total number of motors:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{motor}} = N_{\\mathrm{total}} f = (\\rho_{m} L) f$$\nNow, we can write the force balance equation by equating the motor force and the drag force:\n$$(\\rho_{m} L) f = \\xi L V$$\nAn important consequence of this formulation is that the network length $L$ appears on both sides of the equation and can be canceled. This implies that the steady-state shortening speed is independent of the system size, a common feature in models of one-dimensional continuous active matter.\n$$\\rho_{m} f = \\xi V$$\nThis equation contains two unknowns: the single-motor load force $f$ and the network shortening speed $V$. To solve for $V$, we must introduce the second piece of information provided: the constitutive force-velocity relation for a single myosin minifilament.\nThe relation is given as $v = v_{0}\\left(1 - \\frac{f}{f_{s}}\\right)$, where $v$ is the sliding speed generated by a single motor under load $f$, $v_{0}$ is the unloaded speed, and $f_{s}$ is the stall force.\nThe problem also provides a crucial kinematic link: the macroscopic shortening speed of the network is equal to the microscopic sliding speed of the motors, so $V = v$. Substituting $V$ for $v$ in the force-velocity relation gives:\n$$V = v_{0}\\left(1 - \\frac{f}{f_{s}}\\right)$$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $f$ and $V$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\rho_{m} f = \\xi V \\\\\nV = v_{0}\\left(1 - \\frac{f}{f_{s}}\\right)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nWe want to find $V$.
