The provided kinetic constants are physically realistic and consistent with values reported in experimental literature for actin polymerization. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and constants to derive the required expressions and perform the calculations. The language used is objective and precise. The problem is free of logical contradictions, ambiguities, or pseudo-scientific claims.\n\nStep 3: Verdict.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be constructed.\n\nFirst, we derive the general expression for the barbed-end elongation velocity, $v_{B}$. The elongation process is modeled as a reversible reaction at the barbed end of an actin filament:\n$$\n\\text{Filament End} + A \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Filament End-}A\n$$\nwhere $A$ represents a free actin monomer.\n\nFollowing mass-action kinetics, the rate of monomer addition (the forward flux) is proportional to the concentration of free actin monomers, $[A]$. For a single barbed end, this rate is given by $k_{+}^{B}[A]$. The units are $(\\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(\\mu\\mathrm{M}) = \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which represents subunits added per second.\n\nThe rate of monomer dissociation (the reverse flux) is a first-order process, independent of the free monomer concentration. For a single barbed end, this rate is simply the constant $k_{-}^{B}$, with units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, representing subunits lost per second.\n\nThe net elongation velocity, $v_{B}$, is defined as the forward flux minus the reverse flux. Therefore, we have:\n$$\nv_{B} = k_{+}^{B}[A] - k_{-}^{B}\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the barbed-end critical concentration, $C_{c}^{B}$. By definition, this is the concentration $[A]$ at which the net elongation velocity $v_{B}$ is zero. We set the previous expression to $0$:\n$$\nv_{B} = k_{+}^{B} C_{c}^{B} - k_{-}^{B} = 0\n$$\nSolving for $C_{c}^{B}$ yields:\n$$\nk_{+}^{B} C_{c}^{B} = k_{-}^{B}\n$$\n$$\nC_{c}^{B} = \\frac{k_{-}^{B}}{k_{+}^{B}}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the critical concentration is the ratio of the dissociation rate constant to the association rate constant.\n\nNow, we apply these derived expressions to the specific cases of Arp2/3-generated and formin-bound barbed ends.\n\nFor Arp2/3-generated barbed ends, the critical concentration $C_{c}^{B,\\mathrm{R}}$ is:\n$$\nC_{c}^{B,\\mathrm{R}} = \\frac{k_{-}^{B,\\mathrm{R}}}{k_{+}^{B,\\mathrm{R}}} = \\frac{1.44\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{12.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 0.120\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\n$$\nThe elongation velocities $v_{B,\\mathrm{R}}$ are calculated using $v_{B,\\mathrm{R}} = k_{+}^{B,\\mathrm{R}}[A] - k_{-}^{B,\\mathrm{R}}$:\n1.

The relationship $v_{B} = k_{+}^{B}[A] - k_{-}^{B}$ is a linear function of $[A]$. The slope of this function is the association rate constant, $k_{+}^{B}$, which is an intrinsically positive quantity. The y-intercept is the negative of the dissociation rate constant, $-k_{-}^{B}$.\n- When $[A] < C_{c}^{B}$, the term $k_{+}^{B}[A]$ is less than $k_{-}^{B}$. Consequently, $v_{B}$ is negative, which signifies net depolymerization (the rate of monomer loss exceeds the rate of addition).\n- When $[A] = C_{c}^{B}$, the term $k_{+}^{B}[A]$ is exactly equal to $k_{-}^{B}$. Thus, $v_{B} = 0$, indicating a dynamic equilibrium where the rates of monomer addition and loss are balanced. There is no net change in filament length.\n- When $[A] > C_{c}^{B}$, the term $k_{+}^{B}[A]$ is greater than $k_{-}^{B}$. Thus, $v_{B}$ is positive, signifying net polymerization (the rate of monomer addition exceeds the rate of loss).\n\nThe magnitude of the velocity, $|v_{B}|$, increases linearly with the difference $|[A] - C_{c}^{B}|$. The steepness of this linear relationship is determined by the slope $k_{+}^{B}$. A higher $k_{+}^{B}$, as seen with formin, leads to a more sensitive response of elongation velocity to changes in monomer concentration around the critical concentration. This general behavior holds for both nucleator types, as it is a direct consequence of the mass-action kinetics model.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} -0.840 & 0.000 & 0.960 & -0.180 & 0.000 & 3.06 \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2930935"}, {"introduction": "Beyond understanding the intrinsic kinetics of actin assembly, a key skill for a molecular biologist is predicting how the system responds to targeted perturbations, and small-molecule inhibitors are invaluable tools for this purpose.

The concepts presented—autoinhibition, activation by a GTPase, a two-state equilibrium model, and competition for a common substrate (G-actin)—are fundamental principles in molecular and cell biology. The mathematical formalization, including the definitions of the equilibrium constant $K$, the active fraction $f_{\\mathrm{O}}$, and the rate law $J_{\\mathrm{formin}}$, is consistent and logical. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary information provided to deduce a conclusion. The question is well-posed, asking for a prediction based on the provided model. The premises are scientifically sound and testable. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Solution\nThe problem asks for the effect of a mutation that weakens the DID–DAD affinity in formin. We must trace the consequences of this mutation through the provided model.\n\n1.  **Effect of the Mutation on the Conformational Equilibrium**: The problem states that the intramolecular DID–DAD interaction stabilizes the closed, autoinhibited state $C$. The mutation weakens this interaction. A weaker stabilizing interaction for the state $C$ means that this state is now less favorable compared to the open state $O$. The equilibrium $C \\rightleftharpoons O$ will shift to the right, favoring the open state. The problem explicitly codifies this by stating that \"weakening DID–DAD affinity increases $K$\". Let $K_{\\mathrm{wt}}$ be the equilibrium constant for the wild-type formin and $K_{\\mathrm{mut}}$ be the constant for the mutant formin. According to the problem statement, $K_{\\mathrm{mut}} > K_{\\mathrm{wt}}$.\n\n2.  **Effect on the Fraction of Active Formin**: The fraction of active (open) formin is given by the function $f_{\\mathrm{O}}(K) = \\dfrac{K}{1 + K}$. To determine how $f_{\\mathrm{O}}$ changes with $K$, we can analyze its derivative with respect to $K$:\n    $$ \\frac{df_{\\mathrm{O}}}{dK} = \\frac{d}{dK} \\left( \\frac{K}{1 + K} \\right) = \\frac{(1)(1 + K) - (K)(1)}{(1 + K)^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + K)^2} $$\n    Since $K$, being an equilibrium constant, must be non-negative ($K \\geq 0$), the denominator $(1 + K)^2$ is always positive. Therefore, $\\dfrac{df_{\\mathrm{O}}}{dK} > 0$. This proves that $f_{\\mathrm{O}}$ is a monotonically increasing function of $K$. Since the mutation causes $K$ to increase ($K_{\\mathrm{mut}} > K_{\\mathrm{wt}}$), it must also cause the fraction of active formin to increase. Thus, $f_{\\mathrm{O, mut}} > f_{\\mathrm{O, wt}}$. A larger fraction of the mutant formin will be in the open, active state, even at basal Rho-GTP levels.\n\n3.  **Effect on the Rate of Actin Cable Nucleation**: The rate of formin-dependent nucleation is given by the equation $J_{\\mathrm{formin}} = k_{\\mathrm{nuc}} \\, [\\mathrm{F}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\, f_{\\mathrm{O}}$. The problem specifies that the mutation does not affect the FH$1$–FH$2$ core, which determines the intrinsic catalytic activity, so the rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{nuc}}$ is unchanged. It also states that total formin expression, $[\\mathrm{F}]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, is unaltered. Therefore, $J_{\\mathrm{formin}}$ is directly proportional to $f_{\\mathrm{O}}$. As we have deduced that the mutation increases $f_{\\mathrm{O}}$, it must follow that the rate of nucleation, $J_{\\mathrm{formin}}$, also increases. An increased rate of nucleation corresponds to an increased frequency of spontaneous actin cable initiation.\n\n4.  **Secondary Effects on Competing Pathways**: The problem notes that Arp$2/3$ activity is affected indirectly through competition for G-actin monomers. With an increased rate of nucleation and subsequent elongation of linear filaments by the more active formin population, the consumption of the cytosolic pool of G-actin monomers by formins will increase. This leads to a lower concentration of free G-actin available for other actin-polymerizing machinery, including the Arp$2/3$ complex. As a result, Arp$2/3$-dependent nucleation of branched networks may be reduced.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Increased frequency of spontaneous actin cable initiation at basal Rho–GTP, because a larger fraction of formin is constitutively open due to weakened autoinhibition; a concomitant shift of G-actin toward formin-assembled linear filaments may occur at the expense of Arp2/3 networks.**\n-   This statement claims an increased frequency of actin cable initiation. This is consistent with our finding that $J_{\\mathrm{formin}}$ increases.\n-   The reason provided is that a larger fraction of formin is constitutively open due to weakened autoinhibition. This is consistent with our finding that $f_{\\mathrm{O}}$ increases because the mutation destabilizes the closed state.\n-   The statement also mentions the potential secondary effect: a shift of G-actin consumption toward formins at the expense of Arp$2/3$ networks. This is a logical consequence of increased formin activity and is explicitly mentioned as a possibility in the problem statement.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Decreased spontaneous cable formation, because weakening DID–DAD prevents proper activation by Rho–GTP and destabilizes formin at barbed ends.**\n-   This statement claims decreased cable formation, which contradicts our derivation.\n-   The reason that weakening DID–DAD prevents proper activation by Rho-GTP is illogical. Weakening the autoinhibitory interaction would make the protein more active at basal conditions, not less responsive to an activator that works by overcoming this same inhibition.\n-   The claim that the mutation destabilizes formin at barbed ends is unsubstantiated. The problem states the FH$1$–FH$2$ core, which mediates barbed end interaction, is unaltered.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. No change in spontaneous cables, because DID–DAD autoinhibition affects elongation processivity but not nucleation, which is determined solely by Arp2/3.**\n-   The claim of \"no change\" contradicts our derivation.\n-   The reasoning contains two major errors based on the problem statement. First, it incorrectly claims that DID-DAD autoinhibition does not affect nucleation; the provided model directly links autoinhibition (via $K$ and $f_{\\mathrm{O}}$) to the nucleation rate $J_{\\mathrm{formin}}$. Second, it incorrectly claims that nucleation is determined solely by Arp$2/3$; the problem explicitly defines and discusses formin-dependent nucleation.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. A switch from cable formation to branched network formation, because weakening DID–DAD directly activates the Arp2/3 complex rather than formin.**\n-   The predicted outcome, a switch to branched network formation, is the opposite of our derived conclusion.\n-   The reasoning is fundamentally false. The DID and DAD domains are part of the formin protein. A mutation in formin affects formin. It does not directly activate a different protein, the Arp$2/3$ complex.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2930954"}]}
