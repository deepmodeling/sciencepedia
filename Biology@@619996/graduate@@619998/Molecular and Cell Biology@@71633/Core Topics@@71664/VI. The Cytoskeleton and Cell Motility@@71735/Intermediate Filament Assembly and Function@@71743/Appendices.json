{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The assembly of functional protein complexes is governed by fundamental principles of physical chemistry. This exercise challenges you to apply these principles to the specific case of epithelial keratins. By analyzing the interplay of hydrophobic and electrostatic forces within the coiled-coil structure, you will deduce why type I and type II keratins are obligate heterodimers and predict the cellular consequences of disrupting this partnership, a concept central to understanding tissue integrity and related diseases [@problem_id:2949046].", "problem": "Epithelial keratins are a subclass of intermediate filament (IF) proteins with a tripartite domain organization: a central coiled-coil–competent rod flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. The rod is composed of characteristic heptad repeats, denoted $a$ through $g$, such that positions $a$ and $d$ favor hydrophobic packing in a coiled-coil, whereas positions $e$ and $g$ often carry charged residues that can form interchain salt bridges. In epithelial cells, keratins are encoded as type I (generally more acidic) and type II (generally more basic) proteins. IF assembly proceeds hierarchically from coiled-coil dimers to apolar antiparallel tetramers, then to unit-length filaments (ULFs), and finally to elongated, laterally compacted filaments. Consider an epithelial cell engineered so that only a single keratin type is expressed at normal levels, while the other type is absent. Assume physiological ionic strength and that protein quality-control pathways respond to persistent misfolded or unassembled proteins.\n\nFrom first principles that include the physicochemical basis of coiled-coil formation and the necessity of apolar architecture in IF polymers, which option best explains why type I and type II keratins must heterodimerize and predicts the most likely assembly outcome when only a single keratin type is expressed?\n\nA.

This altered polarity enhances mechanotransduction signaling, partially compensating for any assembly defects.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Keratins are intermediate filament (IF) proteins with a tripartite structure: a central rod domain flanked by head and tail domains.\n- The rod domain has heptad repeats ($a, b, c, d, e, f, g$).\n- Positions $a$ and $d$ are hydrophobic and form a coiled-coil core.\n- Positions $e$ and $g$ are often charged and can form interchain salt bridges.\n- Keratins exist as type I (acidic) and type II (basic) proteins.\n- IF assembly is hierarchical: dimers $\\rightarrow$ apolar antiparallel tetramers $\\rightarrow$ unit-length filaments (ULFs) $\\rightarrow$ elongated filaments.\n- The experimental condition is a cell expressing only one keratin type (either type I or type II).\n- Assumptions include physiological ionic strength and active protein quality-control pathways for unassembled proteins.\n- The question asks for the reason for heterodimerization and the outcome of expressing a single keratin type, based on first principles.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It accurately describes the fundamental molecular biology of keratin intermediate filaments, including their domain structure, the physicochemical basis of coiled-coil formation (hydrophobic core and electrostatic interactions), the classification into acidic (type I) and basic (type II) types, and the hierarchical assembly pathway. The experimental setup, involving the expression of a single keratin type, is a standard and valid approach in cell biology to probe protein function. The question is logically structured and requests a prediction based on the provided principles. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors in the problem setup.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\nThe stability of the initial keratin coiled-coil dimer is governed by a balance of forces. The primary driving force for dimerization is the hydrophobic effect, mediated by the packing of nonpolar residues at the $a$ and $d$ positions of the two $\\alpha$-helices. However, electrostatic interactions between residues at the $e$ and $g$ positions, which lie on the surface of the coiled-coil interface, are also critical.\n\nThe problem states that type I keratins are generally acidic, meaning their $e$ and $g$ positions are enriched in negatively charged residues (Aspartate, Glutamate) at physiological pH. Conversely, type II keratins are basic, enriched in positively charged residues (Lysine, Arginine) at these positions.\n\n1.  **Heterodimer (Type I + Type II):** When a type I chain pairs with a type II chain, the negatively charged residues at the $e$ and $g$ positions of the type I keratin are juxtaposed with the positively charged residues at the corresponding positions of the type II keratin. This allows for the formation of favorable electrostatic interactions, specifically salt bridges. These interactions stabilize the coiled-coil structure, complementing the hydrophobic core. The free energy of dimerization ($\\Delta G_{dimer}$) is favorable.\n\n2.  **Homodimer (Type I + Type I or Type II + Type II):** If two chains of the same type attempt to form a dimer (e.g., type I with type I), the interface at the $e$ and $g$ positions will be populated by like charges (negative with negative). This results in significant electrostatic repulsion. This repulsive force counteracts the stabilizing hydrophobic interactions from the $a$ and $d$ core. The resulting coiled-coil is energetically unfavorable and highly unstable. The same logic applies to a type II homodimer, which would experience positive-with-positive repulsion.\n\n3.  **Assembly Pathway Consequence:** The formation of a stable coiled-coil dimer is the obligatory first step in the IF assembly hierarchy. In the engineered cell expressing only a single keratin type, stable dimers cannot form due to electrostatic repulsion. Consequently, the downstream steps—the formation of apolar antiparallel tetramers, ULFs, and mature filaments—are aborted at the very beginning.\n\n4.  **Cellular Fate:** The expressed single-type keratin monomers or transient, unstable homodimers are considered unassembled or misfolded proteins. The problem states that protein quality-control pathways are active. These pathways, such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system, will recognize and target these unassembled keratins for degradation.\n\n5.  **Phenotype:** The continuous degradation of the only expressed keratin type leads to a complete failure to form a cytoplasmic keratin IF network. Since keratin filaments are the primary stress-bearing elements in epithelial cells, their absence results in a mechanically fragile cytoplasm, making the cell highly susceptible to lysis under physical stress. This is the molecular basis for certain forms of the genetic skin-blistering disease Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Hydrophobic packing at the $a$ and $d$ positions is sufficient to stabilize homodimers of a single keratin type, and these homodimers can align into antiparallel tetramers and filaments with only modest reductions in stability. Cells therefore retain a largely normal IF network.**\nThis option incorrectly dismisses the critical role of electrostatic interactions. The repulsion between like charges at the $e$ and $g$ positions in a homodimer is not a \"modest\" effect; it is a major destabilizing factor that prevents the formation of stable dimers. Therefore, the prediction of a \"largely normal IF network\" is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The complementary distribution of acidic and basic residues at $e$ and $g$ positions across type I and type II keratins minimizes the electrostatic contribution to the coiled-coil free energy, making heterodimers strongly favored. Homodimers of a single type incur electrostatic repulsion and improper axial registry, leading to unstable dimers that fail to form apolar antiparallel tetramers and ULFs. The keratins remain soluble or form nonproductive aggregates and are targeted for degradation, resulting in loss of the keratin IF network and increased epithelial fragility.**\nThis option correctly identifies electrostatic complementarity as the reason for obligate heterodimerization. It correctly predicts that homodimers are unstable due to repulsion. It accurately describes the consequences: failure of the entire assembly pathway, degradation of the unassembled protein by quality-control mechanisms, and the resulting loss of the IF network, leading to increased cell fragility. This aligns perfectly with the derivation from first principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. In the absence of a partner type, a single keratin type can switch assembly pathway and form hollow microtubule-like tubes stabilized by longitudinal head-to-tail bonds, thereby compensating for the missing IF network without major mechanical deficits.**\nThis is scientifically implausible. Keratins (IF proteins) and tubulins (microtubule proteins) have fundamentally different structures and assembly mechanisms. There is no known biological principle that would allow an IF protein to assemble into a microtubule-like structure. The proposed pathway switch is a baseless speculation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Because keratin rod domains resemble those of nuclear lamins, a single keratin type can substitute for lamins to assemble a nuclear lamina at the inner nuclear membrane; keratin IFs in the cytoplasm are dispensable under these conditions.**\nWhile keratins and lamins are both IF proteins (type I/II and type V, respectively) and share a homologous rod domain, their functions are not interchangeable. Lamins are specifically targeted to the nucleus by a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and anchored to the inner nuclear membrane via post-translational modifications (e.g., farnesylation via a CaaX motif), neither of which are present in cytoplasmic keratins. Keratins cannot enter the nucleus to substitute for lamins. Furthermore, cytoplasmic keratins are essential for epithelial integrity and are not \"dispensable.\"\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Homodimers of a single keratin type can assemble into filaments that retain longitudinal polarity rather than apolarity, leading to a keratin network with reversed polarity relative to normal. This altered polarity enhances mechanotransduction signaling, partially compensating for any assembly defects.**\nThis option contains multiple errors. First, it incorrectly assumes stable homodimers can form and assemble. Second, it fundamentally misrepresents IF structure. A defining feature of all IFs is their apolarity, which arises from the antiparallel association of dimers into tetramers. They do not have a \"normal\" polarity that can be \"reversed.\" The concept of a polar IF is contradictory to their established architecture. The final claim about enhanced mechanotransduction is unsubstantiated speculation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2949046"}, {"introduction": "Moving from a theoretical understanding of assembly to a practical experimental design is a critical skill for a cell biologist.

The provided \"foundational facts\" accurately describe the behavior of vimentin and, more generally, polyelectrolytes in solution. The roles of urea as a denaturant, ionic strength in screening electrostatic interactions (Debye-Hückel theory), temperature on reaction kinetics (Arrhenius relation), and reducing agents in preventing disulfide bonding are all fundamental and correct concepts in biochemistry. The described assembly pathway (monomer $\\rightarrow$ dimer $\\rightarrow$ tetramer $\\rightarrow$ filament) is the accepted model for Type III intermediate filaments like vimentin.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for the selection of the \"most likely\" successful protocol from a set of options, based on a defined set of mechanistic principles. It requires a logical deduction, not a guess, and a unique best answer can be reasoned from the provided information.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective, technical language, free from subjectivity or ambiguity.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency**: The provided facts are sufficient and consistent, forming a solid basis for a mechanistic evaluation of the proposed protocols. There are no contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and provides a clear basis for a rigorous analytical solution. I will proceed with the derivation and evaluation.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation of the Optimal Protocol\n\nThe goal is to produce ordered filamentous structures from denatured monomers while avoiding disordered aggregation. This requires navigating the complex energy landscape of protein folding and assembly. An optimal protocol must temporally and spatially separate distinct thermodynamic and kinetic requirements of the process.\n\n1.  **Refolding of Monomers and Formation of Dimers/Tetramers**: The initial step is to remove the chemical denaturant, $8$ M urea, to allow the vimentin monomers to fold into their native $\\alpha$-helical conformation and subsequently associate into coiled-coil dimers. These dimers then associate to form antiparallel tetramers. This refolding process exposes hydrophobic surfaces that were previously solvated by urea. If this process occurs too rapidly (e.g., via a large, single dilution or dialysis step) or under conditions that promote intermolecular interaction (high salt), these exposed hydrophobic patches can lead to non-specific, off-pathway aggregation. Therefore, a slow, gradual removal of urea via **stepwise dialysis** is superior, as it allows the protein to explore its conformational space and find the low-energy native fold, minimizing kinetically trapped aggregates.\n\n2.  **Stabilization of Assembly-Competent Species**: According to Foundational Fact 2, the assembly-competent unit is the soluble tetramer, which is stable at **low ionic strength**. This stability is due to electrostatic repulsion between the charged tetramers. A long Debye length $\\kappa^{-1}$ at low ionic strength $I$ ensures that the repulsive electrostatic potential energy dominates over short-range attractive forces (e.g., hydrophobic, van der Waals) at typical intermolecular distances. Therefore, the urea should be dialyzed away against a **low ionic strength buffer**. This creates a stable, monodisperse population of soluble tetramers, poised for assembly.\n\n3.  **Initiation of Assembly (Polymerization)**: Foundational Fact 3 states that assembly is triggered by screening the electrostatic repulsion. This is achieved by increasing the ionic strength of the solution, which, according to Fact 4, decreases the Debye length $\\kappa^{-1}$. This \"salt jump\" effectively dampens the long-range repulsion, allowing the tetramers to approach each other closely enough for short-range attractive forces to drive their ordered association into unit-length filaments (ULFs) and subsequent longitudinal annealing into long filaments. A physiological ionic strength (e.g., corresponding to $150$ mM NaCl) is typically optimal for this process.\n\n4.  **Kinetics of Assembly and Annealing**: Foundational Fact 5 states that reaction rates increase with temperature. Both the initial formation of ULFs and their subsequent end-to-end annealing are association reactions. Incubating the reaction at a higher, yet non-denaturing, temperature (e.g., physiological temperature of $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$) will accelerate these processes, enabling the formation of long filaments within a practical timeframe. Assembly at a low temperature (e.g., $4^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$) would be kinetically inhibited, resulting in very slow formation of short filaments.\n\n5.  **Prevention of Artifacts**: Foundational Fact 6 highlights the need to prevent oxidative cross-linking via cysteine residues. Vimentin contains a single, highly conserved cysteine residue. Its oxidation can lead to the formation of disulfide-linked dimers and higher-order oligomers, which are off-pathway and can seed aggregation. Therefore, a reducing agent, such as dithiothreitol (DTT), must be maintained throughout all steps of the procedure.\n\nCombining these principles defines the ideal protocol:\n-   **Step 1**: Slow, stepwise removal of urea into a low ionic strength, reducing buffer at a low temperature to facilitate correct folding into stable, soluble tetramers while minimizing aggregation.\n-   **Step 2**: Initiation of assembly by a rapid increase in ionic strength to a physiological level, followed by incubation at a physiological temperature to drive the kinetics of polymerization and annealing.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Stepwise dialysis from $8$ M urea into low ionic strength buffer to form tetramers, followed by salt-triggered assembly at physiological ionic strength and elevated temperature...**\n-   **Dialysis**: Stepwise dialysis ($8 \\rightarrow 0$ M urea) is employed, which is optimal for correct refolding.\n-   **Buffer**: Dialysis is against a low ionic strength buffer ($5$ mM TRIS-HCl), which correctly stabilizes the soluble tetramer intermediates. The buffer contains DTT, preventing unwanted disulfide crosslinks. Dialysis at $4^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ minimizes the rate of potential aggregation during folding. The centrifugation step is a prudent measure to remove any aggregates before polymerization.\n-   **Assembly**: Assembly is triggered by a salt jump to a physiological concentration ($150$ mM NaCl) and the temperature is raised to $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. This combination correctly initiates assembly by screening repulsion and provides the kinetic energy for rapid polymerization and annealing.\n-   **Verdict**: This protocol meticulously follows all the derived first principles. It correctly separates the folding/tetramerization stage from the assembly/annealing stage, optimizing conditions for each. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Single-jump dialysis directly from $8$ M urea into high-salt assembly buffer at room temperature, then cold incubation...**\n-   **Dialysis**: A single-jump dialysis from $8$ M urea directly into $150$ mM NaCl is performed. This is a catastrophic flaw. It attempts to refold the protein under conditions where electrostatic repulsion is already screened. The likely result is massive, non-specific aggregation as folding intermediates with exposed hydrophobic surfaces immediately associate.\n-   **Buffer**: The buffer lacks DTT. This violates a key requirement for preventing irreversible, off-pathway covalent aggregation via disulfide bond formation.\n-   **Temperature**: The final incubation at $4^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ is kinetically unfavorable for ordered filament annealing.\n-   **Verdict**: This protocol violates multiple fundamental principles. It is designed in a way that maximizes aggregation and is unlikely to yield any native filaments. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Low-salt, high-temperature assembly without a salt trigger...**\n-   **Dialysis**: Stepwise dialysis is correctly used to generate the assembly-competent tetramers in a low-salt buffer.\n-   **Assembly**: The protocol then proceeds to incubate at high temperature ($42^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$) but *without* increasing the ionic strength. This is a critical mechanistic error. In low salt, strong electrostatic repulsion prevents the tetramers from associating. The increased temperature will increase the kinetic energy of the tetramers, but this is insufficient to overcome the electrostatic energy barrier to assembly. No significant polymerization will occur.\n-   **Verdict**: This protocol fails because it omits the essential salt trigger required to initiate assembly by screening electrostatic repulsion. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Stepwise urea removal as in A, but hyper-salt and divalent cation trigger at low temperature...**\n-   **Dialysis**: This part is correct; stepwise dialysis into low-salt buffer at $4^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ correctly prepares the soluble tetramers.\n-   **Assembly**: Assembly is triggered by adding NaCl to $500$ mM and MgCl$_2$ to $10$ mM. This ionic strength is excessive. While salt is needed, such high concentrations (\"hyper-salt\") and the presence of divalent cations (Mg$^{2+}$) will cause extreme screening of repulsion, leading to rapid, uncontrolled precipitation (\"salting out\") rather than ordered, hierarchical assembly. MgCl$_2$ is particularly known to promote lateral aggregation and bundling of filaments, not the formation of uniform single filaments.\n-   **Temperature**: Incubation at $4^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ is kinetically unfavorable for the ordered process of longitudinal annealing, further favoring kinetically trapped, disordered aggregates over thermodynamically stable filaments.\n-   **Verdict**: This protocol uses conditions that are too harsh. The excessive salt trigger and low temperature will favor disordered precipitation over ordered assembly. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2948975"}, {"introduction": "Intermediate filaments in living cells are not static structures but highly dynamic polymers whose behavior is tightly regulated.

Then, we apply the biological information provided about vimentin regulation to each construct.\n\n**Principles of FRAP in Filament Dynamics**\n\nThe problem states that FRAP recovery primarily reflects the exchange of subunits.\n1.  **Mobile Fraction ($F_m$)**: This parameter represents the proportion of fluorescent molecules within the photobleached region that are capable of exchanging with unbleached molecules from the surroundings. For a polymer like vimentin, a higher $F_m$ signifies greater filament instability and a larger pool of subunits undergoing dynamic exchange. A completely static, insoluble filament would have an $F_m$ of $0$. A highly dynamic filament that rapidly disassembles and reassembles would have a high $F_m$. Therefore, $F_m$ is directly proportional to filament dynamism.\n\n2.  **Recovery Half-Time ($t_{1/2}$)**: This parameter is the time required for the fluorescence intensity to recover to half of its final plateau value. It is a measure of the rate of molecular exchange. A short $t_{1/2}$ indicates a rapid exchange process, while a long $t_{1/2}$ indicates a slow exchange. Therefore, $t_{1/2}$ is inversely proportional to the rate of filament dynamics.\n\nIn summary:\nHigh filament dynamism (instability) implies a high $F_m$ and a short $t_{1/2}$.\nLow filament dynamism (stability) implies a low $F_m$ and a long $t_{1/2}$.\n\n**Analysis of Vimentin Constructs**\n\nThe problem statement provides the central regulatory mechanism: phosphorylation of serine residues in the N-terminal head domain promotes filament disassembly and subunit exchange. We will now evaluate each construct based on this principle.\n\n-   **Head Phosphomimetic Mutant VIM-H3E ($H3E$)**: This construct has serine residues $Ser(38)$, $Ser(55)$, and $Ser(71)$ in the head domain mutated to glutamate ($E$). Glutamate, with its negative charge, mimics constitutive phosphorylation. According to the stated mechanism, this construct will exhibit a perpetually disassembled or highly dynamic state. This leads to the most active subunit exchange among all constructs.\n    -   Prediction: Highest filament dynamism. Therefore, it will have the **highest $F_m$** and the **shortest $t_{1/2}$**.\n\n-   **Head Nonphosphorylatable Mutant VIM-H3A ($H3A$)**: This construct has the same serine residues mutated to alanine ($A$). Alanine lacks the hydroxyl group required for phosphorylation, thus locking the filament in a nonphosphorylatable state. This mimics the dephosphorylated form, which, according to the problem, is stable and exhibits reduced exchange. This construct will form the most stable, least dynamic filaments.\n    -   Prediction: Lowest filament dynamism. Therefore, it will have the **lowest $F_m$** and the **longest $t_{1/2}$**.\n\n-   **Wild-Type Vimentin ($WT$)**: This is the natural vimentin protein. It is subject to the cell's endogenous regulatory machinery, including kinases and phosphatases. It will exist in a dynamic equilibrium, with a certain basal level of phosphorylation and turnover. Its stability and dynamism will be intermediate between the constitutively \"on\" state of $H3E$ and the constitutively \"off\" state of $H3A$.\n    -   Prediction: Intermediate dynamism. Its $F_m$ and $t_{1/2}$ values will lie between those of $H3E$ and $H3A$.\n\n-   **Tail Phosphomimetic Mutant VIM-T3E ($T3E$)**: This construct has phosphomimetic mutations in the C-terminal tail domain. The problem explicitly states that these positions are \"not implicated in initiation of filament assembly\" and that the role of tail-domain phosphorylation is \"comparatively minor\" for stability. The dominant regulatory action for disassembly and subunit exchange resides in the head domain. Therefore, the effect of these tail mutations on the FRAP parameters should be minimal compared to the head domain mutations. The behavior of $T3E$ should be very close to that of the $WT$ construct, which represents the baseline physiological state.\n    -   Prediction: Dynamism similar to $WT$. Its $F_m$ and $t_{1/2}$ values will be approximately equal to those of $WT$.\n\n**Synthesis of Predictions**\n\nCombining the analyses, we can establish the rank order for both parameters.\n\n-   **For $F_m$ (highest to lowest)**: The order reflects dynamism from most to least.\n    $H3E > WT \\approx T3E > H3A$\n\n-   **For $t_{1/2}$ (shortest to longest)**: The order reflects the rate of exchange from fastest to slowest, which is the inverse of the stability order.\n    $H3E < WT \\approx T3E < H3A$\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nNow we evaluate the provided options against our derived predictions.\n\n-   **A. $F_m$: $H3E > WT \\approx T3E > H3A$; $t_{1/2}$: $H3E < WT \\approx T3E < H3A$**\n    This option precisely matches our derived ordering for both $F_m$ and $t_{1/2}$. It correctly identifies $H3E$ as the most dynamic, $H3A$ as the most stable, and $WT$ and $T3E$ as intermediate and similar to each other.\n    Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n-   **B. $F_m$: $H3A > WT > T3E > H3E$; $t_{1/2}$: $H3A < WT < T3E < H3E$**\n    This option reverses the expected effects. It suggests that the nonphosphorylatable mutant ($H3A$) is the most dynamic, which is in direct contradiction to the provided biological principle that phosphorylation promotes disassembly.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **C. $F_m$: $T3E > H3E > WT > H3A$; $t_{1/2}$: $T3E < H3E < WT < H3A$**\n    This option incorrectly proposes that the tail phosphomimetic mutant ($T3E$) is even more dynamic than the head phosphomimetic mutant ($H3E$). This contradicts the problem's premise that head-domain phosphorylation is the primary driver of disassembly, and tail-domain effects are minor.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **D. $F_m$: $H3E > H3A \\approx WT > T3E$; $t_{1/2}$: $H3E > H3A \\approx WT > T3E$**\n    This option contains multiple fundamental errors. The ordering for $F_m$ incorrectly equates the dynamism of $H3A$ and $WT$. The ordering for $t_{1/2}$ is inconsistent with the principles of FRAP, suggesting that the most dynamic construct ($H3E$, highest $F_m$) also has the slowest recovery rate (highest $t_{1/2}$). This is a physical impossibility under the given assumptions.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a rigorous application of the principles of FRAP and the biological information supplied, only option A presents a logically and scientifically sound prediction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2949065"}]}
