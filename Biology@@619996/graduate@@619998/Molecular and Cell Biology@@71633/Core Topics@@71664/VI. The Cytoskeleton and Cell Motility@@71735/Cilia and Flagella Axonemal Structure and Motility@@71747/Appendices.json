The provided data are based on established facts in molecular and cell biology concerning the ultrastructure of eukaryotic cilia and flagella. The assumptions serve to define a solvable, idealized model, removing biological complexities not relevant to the core calculation. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two quantities: the number of longitudinal repeating units per outer doublet and the total number of outer dynein arm (ODA) docking sites in the entire axoneme. We will address these in sequence, adhering strictly to the provided data.\n\nFirst, we establish the given parameters from the problem statement:\n- Total axonemal length, $L = 12\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Length of the repeating structural unit, $l_{repeat} = 96\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- Spacing of ODA docking sites along an outer doublet, $s_{ODA} = 24\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- Number of outer microtubule doublets in a canonical $9+2$ axoneme, $N_{doublets} = 9$.\n\nFor consistency in calculation, all length dimensions must be converted to a single unit. We will use nanometers ($\\mathrm{nm}$).\nThe total axonemal length is:\n$$L = 12\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 12 \\times 1000\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 12000\\,\\mathrm{nm}$$\n\n1) Calculation of the number of $96\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ repeats per outer doublet.\nThe problem states that the entire axonemal shaft is composed of these repeating units. Each outer doublet spans the full length of the axoneme. Therefore, the number of repeats along a single doublet, which we denote as $N_{repeats}$, is the total length of the doublet, $L$, divided by the length of one repeating unit, $l_{repeat}$.\n$$N_{repeats} = \\frac{L}{l_{repeat}} = \\frac{12000\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{96\\,\\mathrm{nm}}$$\nThe calculation is straightforward:\n$$N_{repeats} = \\frac{12000}{96} = \\frac{1200 \\times 10}{12 \\times 8} = \\frac{100 \\times 10}{8} = \\frac{1000}{8} = 125$$\nThus, there are $125$ repeating $96\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ units along the length of each outer doublet.\n\n2) Calculation of the total number of ODA docking sites.\nThe ODA are located on the $N_{doublets} = 9$ outer doublets. The central pair is explicitly stated to carry no ODA. We must first find the number of ODA docking sites on a single outer doublet, $N_{ODA/doublet}$.\n\nThe problem gives the spacing of ODAs as $s_{ODA} = 24\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. The assumption of a perfectly periodic structure over the length $L$ implies that the number of docking sites is the total length divided by the spacing. This approach is equivalent to recognizing that the ODA periodicity of $24\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ fits perfectly within the axonemal repeat periodicity of $96\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. The number of ODA sites per $96\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ repeat is $\\frac{96\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{24\\,\\mathrm{nm}} = 4$.\nWith $N_{repeats} = 125$ repeats per doublet, the number of ODA sites per doublet is:\n$$N_{ODA/doublet} = N_{repeats} \\times \\left(\\frac{l_{repeat}}{s_{ODA}}\\right) = 125 \\times \\left(\\frac{96\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{24\\,\\mathrm{nm}}\\right) = 125 \\times 4 = 500$$\nAlternatively, and yielding the same result, we can directly divide the total length of the doublet by the ODA spacing:\n$$N_{ODA/doublet} = \\frac{L}{s_{ODA}} = \\frac{12000\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{24\\,\\mathrm{nm}} = 500$$\nThere are $500$ ODA docking sites on each of the nine outer doublets.\n\nTo find the total number of ODA docking sites in the entire axoneme, $N_{ODA,total}$, we multiply the number of sites per doublet by the number of outer doublets.\n$$N_{ODA,total} = N_{ODA/doublet} \\times N_{doublets}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$N_{ODA,total} = 500 \\times 9 = 4500$$\n\nThe two required quantities are $125$ repeats per doublet and $4500$ total ODA docking sites.

This practice is a thought experiment based on the classic demembranated axoneme reactivation assay, a technique that isolates the essential motile apparatus from its cellular context. Analyzing this foundational experiment [@problem_id:2939633] will allow you to explore the direct relationship between the chemical energy input, in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and the mechanical output, such as beat frequency and waveform, proving that the axoneme itself is the fundamental engine of oscillation.", "problem": "A research group uses a classic reactivation preparation to study the biophysics of axonemal motility in the absence of the ciliary membrane. They isolate sea urchin sperm flagella, permeabilize them with a gentle nonionic detergent to remove the membrane while preserving axonemal architecture, wash out endogenous nucleotides, and then reintroduce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in a defined buffer. The group records beat frequency and waveform at ATP concentrations of $10$ $\\mu$M, $100$ $\\mu$M, and $1$ mM, at constant free calcium, magnesium, and ionic strength. They also confirm that nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs do not support sustained beating.\n\nFrom first principles and well-tested mechanistic facts about axonemal dynein chemomechanics and the geometric clutch of the $9+2$ axoneme, which statement best defines the demembranated axoneme reactivation assay and predicts how ATP concentration controls beat frequency and waveform in this membrane-free context?\n\nA. In a demembranated axoneme reactivation assay, membrane removal eliminates all essential regulatory components such that adding ATP alone cannot reinitiate motility; only reconstitution of the plasma membrane or cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling restores beating. Because dynein-generated force is secondarily controlled by membrane channels, ATP concentration has negligible effects on frequency or waveform.\n\nB. In a demembranated axoneme reactivation assay, the plasma membrane is stripped by detergent, leaving the intact axonemal scaffold, including outer and inner dynein arms, nexin links, radial spokes, and the central pair. Upon addition of ATP, beating resumes because the chemomechanical cycle of dynein is intrinsically sufficient for oscillation when coupled to the elastic constraints of the axoneme. Increasing ATP from $10$ $\\mu$M to $1$ mM shortens the nucleotide-limited steps in the dynein cycle, increasing the rate of microtubule sliding and thus beat frequency in a manner that rises with ATP and saturates at high ATP. At low ATP, long attachment and dwell times favor larger static curvature and low-frequency, larger-amplitude waves; as ATP increases, duty ratio and dwell time decline, producing higher frequency, shorter-wavelength, and modestly lower-curvature amplitudes with more symmetric waveforms, all without requiring a surrounding membrane.\n\nC. In a demembranated axoneme reactivation assay, ATP modulates only the bend amplitude because central pair rotation rigidly sets beat frequency independent of motor kinetics. Consequently, increasing ATP from $10$ $\\mu$M to $1$ mM primarily increases amplitude while frequency remains essentially constant, and waveform asymmetry grows because higher ATP preferentially recruits outer dynein arms to one side of the axoneme.\n\nD. In a demembranated axoneme reactivation assay, detergent extraction leaves dynein motors but disrupts elastic linkers, so oscillations arise solely from residual membrane proteins. Therefore, ATP increases beat frequency without bound as its concentration increases, has no effect on curvature amplitude, and nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs can sustain beating because dynein requires only ATP binding, not hydrolysis.", "solution": "The problem statement is submitted for validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem provides the following information about an experimental setup:\n- **System**: Sea urchin sperm flagella.\n- **Procedure**: A classic reactivation preparation.\n    1.

The components (axoneme, dynein, ATP), the model system (sea urchin sperm), and the basic findings (ATP hydrolysis is required for motility) are all factually correct and central to the field of molecular and cell biology. The premise is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The question is well-posed. It asks for a prediction of experimental outcomes (beat frequency and waveform as a function of ATP concentration) based on established mechanistic principles (dynein chemomechanics and axonemal structure). A unique and correct answer based on these principles exists and is widely accepted.\n- **Objective**: The description of the experiment is objective, technical, and free of subjective language.\n- **Flaw Analysis**:\n    1.  **Scientific Unsoundness**: The problem statement is free of scientific or factual errors. The control experiment (nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs) correctly reflects that ATP hydrolysis, not just binding, is necessary for dynein function.\n    2.  **Non-Formalizable or Irrelevant**: The problem is directly relevant to the topic and is based on a physical, formalizable biological mechanism.\n    3.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: The setup is self-contained and sufficient. It provides the necessary context (membrane removed, axoneme intact, ATP added) to reason from first principles. There are no contradictions.\n    4.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The experimental protocol described is not just realistic but is a standard, classic procedure in the field.\n    5.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured**: The question is clearly structured and asks for a specific prediction based on a defined set of principles. It does not admit multiple ambiguous answers.\n    6.  **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, Tautological**: The problem requires a non-trivial synthesis of knowledge regarding enzyme kinetics (dynein as an ATPase), biomechanics (conversion of sliding to bending), and molecular motor function. It is a substantive question.\n    7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: The principles and predictions are experimentally verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a solution from first principles. It is therefore **valid**. The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe experiment described is the canonical demembranated axoneme reactivation assay. Its fundamental purpose is to isolate the core motile apparatus, the axoneme, from the regulatory influences of the cell membrane and cytoplasm.\n\n$1$. **The Axoneme as the Engine of Motility**: The fact that beating can be restored in a demembranated axoneme by the sole addition of ATP and Mg$^{2+}$ (an essential cofactor for ATP hydrolysis by dynein) is the primary evidence that the axoneme itself is the self-contained engine of oscillation. It does not require a membrane or soluble cytoplasmic factors to generate rhythmic bending, although such components are critical for in vivo regulation.\n\n$2$. **The Dynein Chemomechanical Cycle**: Axonemal dynein is a molecular motor and an ATPase. Its activity is powered by the hydrolysis of ATP. The cycle is, in simplified form:\n    a. **Rigor State**: Dynein is tightly bound to a microtubule B-tubule.\n    b. **ATP Binding**: Binding of an ATP molecule causes the dynein head to detach from the B-tubule.\n    c. **ATP Hydrolysis**: ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP + P$_i$, which \"cocks\" the motor domain into a pre-power-stroke conformation.\n    d. **Power Stroke**: The dynein head re-binds to the B-tubule at a new position, and the subsequent release of P$_i$ (phosphate) triggers the power stroke, a conformational change that generates force and slides the adjacent microtubule doublet.\n    e. **ADP Release**: Release of ADP returns the dynein to the rigor state, ready for the next cycle.\n\n$3$. **Role of ATP Concentration ([ATP])**: The overall rate of the dynein cycle, and thus the rate of microtubule sliding, is dependent on the concentration of the substrate, ATP. At low [ATP], the rate-limiting step is the ATP binding event (step $b$). The dynein motor spends a significant amount of time waiting in the rigor state for an ATP molecule to bind. Therefore, the cycle frequency is low. As [ATP] increases, the waiting time for ATP binding decreases, and the overall cycle rate increases. This relationship follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The beat frequency of the axoneme is directly proportional to the microtubule sliding velocity, which is in turn proportional to the dynein cycling rate. Consequently, beat frequency increases with [ATP] and eventually saturates at high [ATP] levels when another step in the cycle (e.g., P$_i$ release or the mechanical translocation itself) becomes rate-limiting. The range given, $10$ $\\mu$M to $1$ mM, spans the typical physiological range where frequency is strongly dependent on and then saturates with [ATP].\n\n$4$. **From Sliding to Bending (Geometric Clutch)**: The axoneme is a \"$9+2$\" array of microtubule doublets arranged in a cylinder. These doublets are connected by elastic nexin links and are anchored at the base of the flagellum. These structural constraints prevent the free sliding of doublets past one another. Instead, the dynein-generated sliding force is converted into a bending moment, causing the entire axoneme to bend. The coordinated and alternating activity of dynein motors on opposite sides of the axoneme generates the propagated oscillatory wave.\n\n$5$. **Effect on Waveform**: As [ATP] changes, the kinetics of the dynein motors change, which affects the waveform.\n    - At low [ATP], dyneins have a long dwell time in the force-holding rigor state. This high \"duty ratio\" allows for the development of substantial static force, which can lead to larger amplitude bends, albeit at a low frequency.\n    - As [ATP] increases, the cycle time shortens and the duty ratio decreases. Dyneins cycle more rapidly. This results in a higher frequency of beat. The wave characteristics also change: typically, the wavelength shortens, and the amplitude may decrease modestly as the system is driven faster. The waveform may also become more symmetric_ because the intrinsic, stripped-down mechanics of the axoneme are less subject to the asymmetric regulation normally imposed by systems like the central pair/radial spoke complex, which are themselves often regulated by second messengers like Ca$^{2+}$ (held constant here).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In a demembranated axoneme reactivation assay, membrane removal eliminates all essential regulatory components such that adding ATP alone cannot reinitiate motility; only reconstitution of the plasma membrane or cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling restores beating. Because dynein-generated force is secondarily controlled by membrane channels, ATP concentration has negligible effects on frequency or waveform.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The central discovery enabled by this assay is that adding ATP *alone* is sufficient to reinitiate motility in the isolated axoneme. This demonstrates that the axoneme is the motile engine. The assertion that ATP concentration has negligible effects is also false; as derived above, it is the primary determinant of beat frequency in this system.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. In a demembranated axoneme reactivation assay, the plasma membrane is stripped by detergent, leaving the intact axonemal scaffold, including outer and inner dynein arms, nexin links, radial spokes, and the central pair. Upon addition of ATP, beating resumes because the chemomechanical cycle of dynein is intrinsically sufficient for oscillation when coupled to the elastic constraints of the axoneme. Increasing ATP from $10$ $\\mu$M to $1$ mM shortens the nucleotide-limited steps in the dynein cycle, increasing the rate of microtubule sliding and thus beat frequency in a manner that rises with ATP and saturates at high ATP. At low ATP, long attachment and dwell times favor larger static curvature and low-frequency, larger-amplitude waves; as ATP increases, duty ratio and dwell time decline, producing higher frequency, shorter-wavelength, and modestly lower-curvature amplitudes with more symmetric waveforms, all without requiring a surrounding membrane.**\nThis statement accurately describes the preparation, the core principle of the assay, the kinetic relationship between ATP concentration and beat frequency, and the resulting effects on waveform. Each point aligns perfectly with the first-principles derivation. The description of changing dynein dwell time (duty ratio) and its consequences for frequency and amplitude is a correct and sophisticated explanation of the biophysics.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. In a demembranated axoneme reactivation assay, ATP modulates only the bend amplitude because central pair rotation rigidly sets beat frequency independent of motor kinetics. Consequently, increasing ATP from $10$ $\\mu$M to $1$ mM primarily increases amplitude while frequency remains essentially constant, and waveform asymmetry grows because higher ATP preferentially recruits outer dynein arms to one side of the axoneme.**\nThis statement makes several incorrect claims. First, beat frequency is directly and strongly dependent on dynein motor kinetics, which is fueled by ATP. It is not rigidly set by the central pair independent of the motors. Second, the primary effect of increasing [ATP] is an increase in frequency, not amplitude. Third, there is no established principle that higher ATP preferentially recruits dyneins to one side; regulation of asymmetry is a more complex process involving the central pair and radial spokes, typically modulated by signals like Ca$^{2+}$, not directly by ATP levels in this manner.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. In a demembranated axoneme reactivation assay, detergent extraction leaves dynein motors but disrupts elastic linkers, so oscillations arise solely from residual membrane proteins. Therefore, ATP increases beat frequency without bound as its concentration increases, has no effect on curvature amplitude, and nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs can sustain beating because dynein requires only ATP binding, not hydrolysis.**\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple counts. (1) The \"gentle nonionic detergent\" is chosen specifically to *preserve* elastic linkers (e.g., nexin); their disruption would lead to microtubule extrusion, not bending. (2) Oscillations arise from the axoneme, not residual membrane proteins; the membrane has been removed. (3) Beat frequency saturates at high [ATP] due to Michaelis-Menten kinetics; it does not increase \"without bound\". (4) It contradicts the problem's own given fact and a fundamental principle of motor proteins by claiming nonhydrolyzable analogs can sustain beating.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2939633"}, {"introduction": "Having established that the axoneme is an ATP-driven engine, we can now use targeted perturbations to dissect its internal mechanisms.

The $9+2$ structure, the role of dynein, ATP as the energy source, and the low Reynolds number regime are all factually correct and fundamental to the topic.

The hypothetical inhibitor is described with plausible biophysical parameters ($K_d$, stall force, $k_{\\text{cat}}$).\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a clear baseline, two well-defined perturbations, and a set of foundational principles to guide the reasoning. It asks for a qualitative prediction, which is uniquely determinable from the given information and principles.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is technical and precise, devoid of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived based on the provided principles.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis will proceed by considering each perturbation separately and predicting its effect on beat frequency ($f$) and amplitude ($A$) based on the foundational principles of dynein mechanochemistry and axonemal biomechanics.\n\n**Analysis of Perturbation 1: Addition of $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ Orthovanadate (Vi)**\n\n1.  **Mechanism of Action**: Orthovanadate traps dynein in an ADP$\\cdot$Vi state. This state is known to be a **long-lived, strongly microtubule-bound** state that precedes phosphate release and the power stroke. By forming this stable, dead-end complex, Vi effectively removes dynein motors from the active catalytic cycle.\n\n2.  **Effect on Beat Frequency ($f$)**: The beat frequency is fundamentally limited by the rate of the underlying mechanochemical cycle of the dynein ensemble. By trapping a fraction of the dynein motors in a non-cycling state, orthovanadate acts as a potent inhibitor of the overall ATPase activity of the axoneme. A slower enzymatic cycle means that the time required to complete one full mechanical oscillation (bending and unbending) increases. Therefore, the beat frequency $f$ must **decrease** relative to the baseline $f_0$.\n\n3.  **Effect on Bend Amplitude ($A$)**: The bend amplitude is determined by the magnitude of microtubule sliding, which results from the balance between active forces and resistive forces.\n    -   **Active Force**: Since a fraction of dynein motors are trapped and inactive, the total number of motors contributing to force generation per unit time is reduced. This leads to a decrease in the net active shear force and, consequently, the active bending moment that drives axonemal bending.\n    -   **Internal Resistance**: The dyneins trapped in the ADP$\\cdot$Vi state are strongly bound to the adjacent microtubule doublet. These motors do not contribute to active sliding but instead act as static, rigid cross-bridges. These cross-bridges resist the sliding motion generated by the remaining active dyneins, thereby increasing the internal stiffness or resistance of the axoneme.\n    -   **Conclusion**: The combination of reduced active force generation and increased internal resistance leads to a smaller extent of microtubule sliding for a given cycle. Thus, the bend amplitude $A$ must **decrease** relative to the baseline $A_0$.\n\n**Summary for Perturbation 1**: Both frequency ($f$) and amplitude ($A$) are expected to decrease.\n\n**Analysis of Perturbation 2: Small Molecule Inhibitor**\n\n1.  **Mechanism of Action**: This inhibitor has three distinct effects: (i) increases $K_d$ by $4\\times$, (ii) reduces stall force by $50\\%$, and (iii) leaves $k_{\\text{cat}}$ unchanged.\n\n2.  **Effect on Bend Amplitude ($A$)**:\n    -   The amplitude depends on the net active bending moment. The active moment is proportional to the number of active motors and the force per motor.\n    -   The stall force is reduced by $50\\%$, which directly cuts the force-generating capacity of each motor in half.\n    -   An increased dissociation constant ($K_d$) implies that the dynein motors spend a smaller fraction of their cycle time strongly bound to the microtubule (i.e., the duty ratio is reduced). The strongly-bound state is the force-producing state.\n    -   The combination of lower force per motor and less time spent producing force results in a substantial reduction of the time-averaged active shear force. This reduced active bending moment cannot overcome the passive elastic and viscous resistances as effectively as before. Therefore, the bend amplitude $A$ must **decrease**.\n\n3.  **Effect on Beat Frequency ($f$)**:\n    -   The frequency is set by the rate-limiting step of the cycle. The problem states $k_{\\text{cat}}$ (the intrinsic maximal ATP turnover rate) is unchanged. This might suggest no change in frequency.\n    -   However, the problem also directs us to consider load-dependent attachment/detachment kinetics. Dynein motors that have completed their power stroke but remain attached act as a resistive load that opposes sliding. The rate of detachment of these motors can be a limiting factor for sliding velocity and, by extension, beat frequency.\n    -   An increase in $K_d$ (where $K_d = k_{\\text{off}}/k_{\\text{on}}$) usually implies an increase in the dissociation rate constant, $k_{\\text{off}}$. Faster detachment would mean that dyneins acting as resistive loads are cleared more quickly.\n    -   Furthermore, the foundation states that strongly bound states contribute to \"internal cross-bridge resistance\". By increasing $K_d$, the inhibitor reduces the time dynein spends in the strongly bound state, thus lowering the average internal resistance of the axoneme.\n    -   A reduction in internal load/resistance can allow the system to run faster, even if the intrinsic catalytic rate of an unloaded motor is unchanged. The system's overall speed is a function of both the motor's properties and the load it works against. By reducing the internal load, the inhibitor can cause a **modest increase** in the beat frequency $f$.\n\n**Summary for Perturbation 2**: The amplitude ($A$) is expected to decrease, while the frequency ($f$) is expected to increase modestly.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n- **A. With $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ orthovanadate: $f$ decreases and $A$ decreases because dynein ATPase is suppressed and motors are trapped longer in strongly bound, load-bearing states; with the microtubule-binding inhibitor: $A$ decreases but $f$ exhibits a modest increase because weaker binding reduces internal cross-bridge resistance while $k_{\\text{cat}}$ is unchanged.**\n  - The analysis for orthovanadate is correct: $f$ decreases and $A$ decreases, and the reasoning is sound.\n  - The analysis for the inhibitor is correct: $A$ decreases due to reduced force generation (implied), and $f$ increases modestly due to reduced internal resistance from weaker/briefer binding. The reasoning provided is accurate and captures the key biophysical subtlety.\n  - **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. With $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ orthovanadate: $f$ increases and $A$ decreases because dynein is locked in a weakly bound, fast-turnover state; with the microtubule-binding inhibitor: $f$ decreases but $A$ increases because fewer cross-bridges allow larger sliding excursions.**\n  - The prediction of $f$ increasing for vanadate is incorrect. The reasoning that dynein is locked in a *weakly* bound state is factually wrong; the ADP$\\cdot$Vi state is *strongly* bound.\n  - The prediction of $A$ increasing for the inhibitor is incorrect.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. With $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ orthovanadate: $f$ decreases with little change in $A$ because cross-bridge stiffness is increased without reducing active force; with the microtubule-binding inhibitor: $f$ is unchanged but $A$ decreases.**\n  - The prediction of \"little change in $A$\" for vanadate is incorrect; amplitude should decrease significantly. The reasoning \"without reducing active force\" is also incorrect, as trapping motors removes them from the active pool.\n  - The prediction of $f$ being unchanged for the inhibitor is a plausible but less complete analysis than that in option A.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. Both $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ orthovanadate and the microtubule-binding inhibitor reduce $f$ and increase $A$ because the axoneme becomes more compliant in both cases.**\n  - The prediction that $A$ increases is incorrect for both perturbations. The reasoning that the axoneme becomes more compliant is incorrect for the vanadate case, where it becomes stiffer.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **E. With $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ orthovanadate: beating is abolished at any dose; with the microtubule-binding inhibitor producing a $4\\times$ increase in $K_d$: neither $f$ nor $A$ changes detectably.**\n  - The claim that beating is abolished at *any* dose contradicts the problem's premise to consider partial inhibition.\n  - The claim that a $50\\%$ reduction in stall force and a $4\\times$ change in $K_d$ would cause no detectable change is implausible.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThe only option that aligns completely with a rigorous biophysical analysis based on the provided foundations is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2939642"}]}
