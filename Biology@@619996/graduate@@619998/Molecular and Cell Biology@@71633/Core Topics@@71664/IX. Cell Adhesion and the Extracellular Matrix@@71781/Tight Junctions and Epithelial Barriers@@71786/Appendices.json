The provided physical and chemical parameters are realistic for a biological experiment. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient data to determine the requested parameter, $r_p$. The problem requires knowledge of the specific functional form for the hindrance factor, which is described as a \"widely used, experimentally validated approximation.\" In the context of advanced science and engineering, expecting the student to know or retrieve this standard model (e.g., the Renkin equation or Deen's functions) is acceptable. The problem is therefore deemed complete and formalizable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will now be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Permeability Expression and Solution**\n\nThe flux $J_i$ of a solute species $i$ across the epithelial monolayer, normalized by the total area of the monolayer, is defined by its apparent permeability $P_{\\text{app},i}$ and the bulk concentration difference $\\Delta C$:\n$$J_i = P_{\\text{app},i} \\Delta C$$\n\nThis macroscopic flux arises from diffusion through the paracellular pores. The flux is restricted to the total area of the pores. Let $N_p$ be the number of pores per unit area of the epithelium. The fractional area available for diffusion is $N_p \\pi r_p^2$. The flux must also account for hindered diffusion within the pores.\n\nThe effective one-dimensional flux inside a single pore is governed by Fick's law, with an effective diffusion coefficient $D_{\\text{eff},i}$ and an effective concentration gradient. The effective concentration difference across the pore length $L$ is reduced by the steric partitioning coefficient $\\Phi(\\lambda_i)$, so $\\Delta C_{\\text{pore}} = \\Phi(\\lambda_i) \\Delta C$. The effective diffusivity is reduced from its free-solution value $D_i$ by the hydrodynamic hindrance factor $K(\\lambda_i)$, so $D_{\\text{eff},i} = D_i K(\\lambda_i)$.\n\nThe flux density inside a pore is $j_{\\text{pore},i} = D_{\\text{eff},i} \\frac{\\Delta C_{\\text{pore}}}{L} = D_i K(\\lambda_i) \\frac{\\Phi(\\lambda_i) \\Delta C}{L}$. The total flux per unit area of monolayer is the flux per pore multiplied by the number of pores per unit area:\n$$J_i = (j_{\\text{pore},i} \\times \\pi r_p^2) \\times N_p = \\frac{N_p \\pi r_p^2}{L} D_i \\Phi(\\lambda_i) K(\\lambda_i) \\Delta C$$\nComparing this with the definition of $P_{\\text{app},i}$, we find:\n$$P_{\\text{app},i} = \\frac{N_p \\pi r_p^2}{L} D_i \\Phi(\\lambda_i) K(\\lambda_i)$$\nThe term $\\frac{N_p \\pi r_p^2}{L}$ is a structural parameter group of the monolayer, independent of the diffusing solute. Let us denote this constant as $C_{sys}$.\n$$P_{\\text{app},i} = C_{sys} D_i H(\\lambda_i)$$\nwhere $H(\\lambda_i) = \\Phi(\\lambda_i) K(\\lambda_i)$ is the total hindrance factor.\n\nThe Stokes-Einstein relation gives the free-solution diffusion coefficient $D_i$ for a sphere of radius $a_i$:\n$$D_i = \\frac{k_B T}{6 \\pi \\eta a_i}$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.Substituting this into the permeability equation yields:\n$$P_{\\text{app},i} = C_{sys} \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{6 \\pi \\eta a_i}\\right) H(\\lambda_i)$$\nTo solve for $r_p$, we can eliminate the unknown system constants by taking the ratio of permeabilities for two different solutes, $i$ and $j$:\n$$\\frac{P_{\\text{app},i}}{P_{\\text{app},j}} = \\frac{C_{sys} \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{6 \\pi \\eta a_i}\\right) H(a_i/r_p)}{C_{sys} \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{6 \\pi \\eta a_j}\\right) H(a_j/r_p)} = \\frac{a_j}{a_i} \\frac{H(a_i/r_p)}{H(a_j/r_p)}$$\nRearranging provides a more direct relationship:\n$$\\frac{P_{\\text{app},i} \\cdot a_i}{P_{\\text{app},j} \\cdot a_j} = \\frac{H(a_i/r_p)}{H(a_j/r_p)}$$\nThe left-hand side is determined from experimental data. The right-hand side is a function of the single unknown parameter $r_p$. The widely accepted functions for hindered diffusion of a hard sphere in a cylinder are:\n$$\\Phi(\\lambda) = (1 - \\lambda)^2$$\n$$K(\\lambda) \\approx 1 - 2.104\\lambda + 2.089\\lambda^3 - 0.948\\lambda^5$$\nThus, the total hindrance factor is $H(\\lambda) = (1 - \\lambda)^2 (1 - 2.104\\lambda + 2.089\\lambda^3 - 0.948\\lambda^5)$.\n\nWe now use the experimental data to find the $r_p$ that best fits the model.
