A quantitative solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe task is to compute the $EC_{50}$ for $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ and $\\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$ and assess the role of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ based on the provided data. The $EC_{50}$ is the concentration of the activating cation, $[X]$, at which the specific binding response is half of its maximum. The specific binding response induced by the cation is $B - B_{\\mathrm{EDTA}}$. The maximum specific response is $B_{\\max} - B_{\\mathrm{EDTA}}$. Therefore, the $EC_{50}$ corresponds to the concentration $[X]$ where the binding signal $B$ satisfies the equation:\n$$B_{EC50} = B_{\\mathrm{EDTA}} + 0.5 \\times (B_{\\max} - B_{\\mathrm{EDTA}}) = 0.5 \\times (B_{\\max} + B_{\\mathrm{EDTA}})$$\n\nThe model to be used is $f([X]) = \\dfrac{[X]}{EC_{50} + [X]}$, with the normalized response $f = \\dfrac{B - B_{\\mathrm{EDTA}}}{B_{\\max} - B_{\\mathrm{EDTA}}}$. At $EC_{50}$, $[X]=EC_{50}$, which correctly gives $f([X])=0.5$.\n\n**Analysis for $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$**\nThe baseline binding is $B_{\\mathrm{EDTA}} = 0.02$.\nThe data for $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ shows that the binding signal increases with concentration and appears to plateau. We take the measurement at the highest concentration as the maximum response, so $B_{\\max, \\mathrm{Mg}} = B(2.00\\,\\mathrm{mM}) = 0.95$.\nThe binding signal at the $EC_{50}$ is:\n$$B_{EC50, \\mathrm{Mg}} = 0.5 \\times (0.95 + 0.02) = 0.5 \\times 0.97 = 0.485$$\nWe must find the concentration $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]$ that results in $B = 0.485$. From the data:\n- At $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}] = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, $B = 0.45$.\n- At $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}] = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, $B = 0.74$.\nThe target value $B = 0.485$ lies between these two data points. We can estimate the corresponding concentration by linear interpolation:\n$$[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_{EC50} \\approx 0.20\\,\\mathrm{mM} + (0.50\\,\\mathrm{mM} - 0.20\\,\\mathrm{mM}) \\times \\frac{0.485 - 0.45}{0.74 - 0.45}$$\n$$[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_{EC50} \\approx 0.20\\,\\mathrm{mM} + (0.30\\,\\mathrm{mM}) \\times \\frac{0.035}{0.29} \\approx 0.20\\,\\mathrm{mM} + 0.0362\\,\\mathrm{mM} \\approx 0.236\\,\\mathrm{mM}$$\nThus, $EC_{50, \\mathrm{Mg}} \\approx 0.24\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n\n**Analysis for $\\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$**\nThe baseline is again $B_{\\mathrm{EDTA}} = 0.02$.\nThe data for $\\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$ also shows a saturating curve. We set $B_{\\max, \\mathrm{Mn}} = B(0.20\\,\\mathrm{mM}) = 0.94$.\nThe binding signal at the $EC_{50}$ is:\n$$B_{EC50, \\mathrm{Mn}} = 0.5 \\times (0.94 + 0.02) = 0.5 \\times 0.96 = 0.48$$\nWe must find the concentration $[\\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}]$ that results in $B = 0.48$. From the data:\n- At $[\\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}] = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, $B = 0.40$.\n- At $[\\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}] = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, $B = 0.60$.\nThe target value $B = 0.48$ lies between these two points. By linear interpolation:\n$$[\\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}]_{EC50} \\approx 0.01\\,\\mathrm{mM} + (0.02\\,\\mathrm{mM} - 0.01\\,\\mathrm{mM}) \\times \\frac{0.48 - 0.40}{0.60 - 0.40}$$\n$$[\\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}]_{EC50} \\approx 0.01\\,\\mathrm{mM} + (0.01\\,\\mathrm{mM}) \\times \\frac{0.08}{0.20} = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{mM} + 0.004\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 0.014\\,\\mathrm{mM}$$\nThus, $EC_{50, \\mathrm{Mn}} \\approx 0.014\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n\n**Analysis for $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$**\nThe binding signals measured across the $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration range ($0.05\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ to $2.00\\,\\mathrm{mM}$) are $B=0.03$ or $B=0.02$. These values are indistinguishable from the baseline binding in EDTA, $B_{\\mathrm{EDTA}} = 0.02$. There is no significant increase in binding above the baseline. Therefore, $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ does not act as an activator in the tested concentration range, and an $EC_{50}$ for activation cannot be determined.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**Option A:**\n- **Experimental Design**: Describes a flow cytometry experiment on live cells at $4\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ with a fluorescent tracer, titrating cations while keeping ionic strength constant, and using appropriate controls (EDTA for baseline, excess unlabeled ligand for nonspecific binding).

My calculations yielded $EC_{50, \\mathrm{Mg}} \\approx 0.24\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ and $EC_{50, \\mathrm{Mn}} \\approx 0.014\\,\\mathrm{mM}$. Both calculated values fall within the ranges specified in this option. The conclusion regarding $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is also correct.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**Option B:**\n- **Experimental Design**: Proposes varying the tracer concentration and measuring the $IC_{50}$ of a competitor. This experiment measures ligand affinity, not cation potency. It fundamentally misunderstands the goal. Equating the $IC_{50}$ of a ligand with the $EC_{50}$ of a cation is a severe conceptual error.\n- **Quantitative Results**: Reports $EC_{50}$ values that are grossly inconsistent with the data. For example, it suggests $EC_{50,\\mathrm{Mg}} \\approx 2\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, but at this concentration binding is near maximal, not half-maximal. It incorrectly assigns an $EC_{50}$ for $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C:**\n- **Experimental Design**: Proposes a Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) experiment using purified proteins (soluble ectodomain and immobilized fibronectin). This is a cell-free assay, which contradicts the problem statement's specification of \"on live cells\".\n- **Conceptual Error**: It incorrectly defines the cation $EC_{50}$ as the ligand-receptor dissociation constant, $K_{D}$. These are distinct physical quantities.\n- **Quantitative Results**: The reported values ($1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$ for $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, $0.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$ for $\\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$) are three orders of magnitude different from the values calculated from the data.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D:**\n- **Experimental Design**: Proposes measuring integrin conformational change via a conformation-specific antibody following inside-out activation by Talin overexpression, an experiment performed \"without ligand competition\". This setup does not measure the effect of *extracellular cations* on *ligand binding*, which is the central objective. The readout (antibody binding) is different from the readout specified in the problem (tracer ligand binding).\n- **Quantitative Results**: The reported $EC_{50}$ values ($0.05\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ for both $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ and $\\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$) are demonstrably false when checked against the provided binding data. At $0.05\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, binding is far below half-max.

Cell-averaged traction stress decreases, but vinculin and zyxin intensities increase due to compensatory recruitment; talin FRET efficiency decreases; FAK pY397 and paxillin pY118 increase due to negative feedback release; actin retrograde flow decreases; YAP/TAZ nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio increases.\n\nC. On stiff substrates, cell-averaged traction stress is unchanged; vinculin recruitment increases because adhesion growth is stiffness-limited rather than force-limited; talin FRET efficiency decreases; FAK pY397 is unchanged while paxillin pY118 increases; actin retrograde flow is unchanged; YAP/TAZ nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio remains high.\n\nD. Cell-averaged traction stress decreases modestly; vinculin intensity is unchanged but zyxin increases as a repair response; talin FRET efficiency is unchanged because talin stretch is force-insensitive; FAK pY397 decreases while paxillin pY118 is unchanged; actin retrograde flow is unchanged; YAP/TAZ nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio is unchanged because nuclear import depends only on substrate stiffness.\n\nE. Cell-averaged traction stress decreases; vinculin intensity decreases but zyxin intensity increases as low tension preferentially recruits zyxin; talin FRET efficiency increases; FAK pY397 increases due to enhanced integrin clustering at low force; actin retrograde flow increases; YAP/TAZ nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio increases due to reduced cytoskeletal opposition to nuclear translocation.", "solution": "The problem statement requires a deduction of the integrated cellular response to acute inhibition of nonmuscle myosin II with blebbistatin, based on a set of provided fundamental principles of mechanobiology.\n\nFirst, a validation of the problem statement is necessary.\nThe givens are:\n1.  **System**: Fibroblasts cultured on fibronectin-coated polyacrylamide hydrogels of varying elastic moduli.\n2.  **Perturbation**: Acute inhibition of nonmuscle myosin II adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity with blebbistatin at a concentration of $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ for $30$ minutes.\n3.  **Readouts**: Cell-averaged traction stress, focal adhesion composition (vinculin, zyxin), talin conformational state (FRET sensor), phosphorylation of FAK (pY$397$) and paxillin (pY$118$), actin retrograde flow, and YAP/TAZ nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio.\n4.  **Principles**:\n    (i) Myosin II ATPase activity generates contractile tension transmitted to the ECM.\n    (ii) Focal adhesion growth and maturation are tension-dependent via talin stretching, which exposes vinculin-binding sites.\n    (iii) Integrin-ligand bonds can exhibit catch-bond behavior.\n    (iv) Phosphorylation of FAK pY397 and paxillin pY118, and nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ, are enhanced by cytoskeletal tension.\n    (v) Reduced cytoskeleton-ECM coupling increases actin retrograde flow.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as it describes a standard and well-characterized experiment in cell mechanobiology. The principles provided are cornerstones of the field. The language is objective and precise. The problem is well-posed, asking for the most consistent set of outcomes derived from the given principles. It is self-contained and free of contradictions. The experimental parameters ($50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ blebbistatin, $30$ minutes) are within realistic and commonly used ranges for achieving potent inhibition. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution may be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds by systematically applying the provided principles to deduce the effects of the perturbation.\n\nThe core perturbation is the inhibition of nonmuscle myosin II ATPase activity.\n\n1.  **Effect on Force Generation**: According to principle (i), myosin II activity is the source of contractile tension. Inhibiting this activity with blebbistatin will directly and substantially reduce the generation of intracellular tension. Consequently, the force transmitted to the extracellular matrix (ECM) through focal adhesions will decrease. This leads to the first prediction: **cell-averaged traction stress will decrease substantially.**\n\n2.  **Effect on Focal Adhesions and Talin Tension**: Principle (ii) states that focal adhesion maturation is tension-dependent. Force stretches the focal adhesion protein talin, which acts as a mechanosensor. This stretching exposes cryptic binding sites for other proteins, such as vinculin, leading to adhesion reinforcement and growth.\n    - With reduced tension from myosin II inhibition, the force exerted on talin molecules will decrease. Talin will adopt a more compact, less stretched conformation.\n    - A FRET-based talin tension sensor measures the distance between two fluorophores (a donor and an acceptor) engineered into the talin molecule. Reduced stretch brings the fluorophores closer together, thereby **increasing the Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) efficiency**.\n    - The reduced stretch of talin means fewer vinculin-binding sites will be exposed. This will lead to a **decrease in vinculin recruitment** to focal adhesions. Zyxin is another tension-sensitive protein that is recruited to focal adhesions under force; its levels are also expected to **decrease**.\n    - The loss of these reinforcing proteins and the overall reduction in mechanical load will destabilize the adhesions, causing them to **fail to mature and shrink in size/area**. This effect is further supported by principle (iii), as the reduced force on integrin-ligand bonds would shift them out of the optimal force range for catch-bond behavior, decreasing their lifetime and weakening the adhesion.\n\n3.  **Effect on Mechanosensitive Signaling**: Principle (iv) directly links key signaling events to cytoskeletal tension.\n    - The phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at tyrosine $397$ (pY$397$) and of paxillin at tyrosine $118$ (pY$118$) are well-established markers of active, force-bearing adhesions. As tension is reduced, the activity of the kinases responsible for these phosphorylation events (such as Src-family kinases recruited to active adhesions) will decrease. Therefore, **levels of FAK pY$397$ and paxillin pY$118$ will decrease**.\n    - The nuclear localization of the transcriptional regulators YAP and TAZ is also controlled by mechanical cues. High cytoskeletal tension promotes their translocation into the nucleus. The relaxation of the cytoskeleton following blebbistatin treatment will lead to the sequestration of YAP/TAZ in the cytoplasm. Consequently, the **YAP/TAZ nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio will decrease**.\n\n4.  **Effect on Actin Dynamics**: Principle (v) describes the relationship between ECM coupling and actin retrograde flow. The actin cytoskeleton is coupled to the ECM via integrins and their associated focal adhesions, forming a molecular \"clutch\". This clutch opposes the rearward flow of the actin network, which is driven by actin polymerization at the cell's leading edge.\n    - As established in point $2$, blebbistatin treatment leads to the weakening and disassembly of focal adhesions. This results in a \"reduced coupling\" or disengagement of the molecular clutch.\n    - With the clutch disengaged, the \"brake\" on the actin network is released. The ongoing actin polymerization at the front will now drive a faster rearward movement of the actin meshwork. Therefore, the **rate of actin retrograde flow will increase**.\n\nIn summary, the expected integrated response to blebbistatin treatment is: a substantial decrease in traction stress, an increase in talin FRET efficiency, a decrease in vinculin and zyxin recruitment leading to adhesion shrinkage, a decrease in FAK and paxillin phosphorylation, a decrease in the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of YAP/TAZ, and an increase in actin retrograde flow.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option against this derived set of consequences.\n\n**A. Cell-averaged traction stress decreases substantially; vinculin and zyxin intensities in adhesions decrease; talin FRET efficiency increases (consistent with reduced talin stretch); FAK pY$397$ and paxillin pY$118$ levels decrease; actin retrograde flow increases; YAP/TAZ nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio decreases; nascent adhesions fail to mature and overall adhesion area shrinks.**\nThis option aligns perfectly with all the deductions made from the provided principles. Each stated observation is a direct and logical consequence of inhibiting myosin II-generated tension.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Cell-averaged traction stress decreases, but vinculin and zyxin intensities increase due to compensatory recruitment; talin FRET efficiency decreases; FAK pY$397$ and paxillin pY$118$ increase due to negative feedback release; actin retrograde flow decreases; YAP/TAZ nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio increases.**\nThis option contains multiple contradictions. Vinculin recruitment is tension-dependent (principle ii), so it should decrease, not increase. Talin FRET efficiency should increase with relaxation, not decrease. FAK/paxillin phosphorylation and YAP/TAZ nuclear localization are driven by tension (principle iv), so they should decrease, not increase. Actin retrograde flow increases with reduced coupling (principle v), it does not decrease. The justifications \"compensatory recruitment\" and \"negative feedback release\" are ad hoc and not supported by the givens.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. On stiff substrates, cell-averaged traction stress is unchanged; vinculin recruitment increases because adhesion growth is stiffness-limited rather than force-limited; talin FRET efficiency decreases; FAK pY$397$ is unchanged while paxillin pY$118$ increases; actin retrograde flow is unchanged; YAP/TAZ nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio remains high.**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. Blebbistatin inhibits the motor (myosin II), so traction stress *must* decrease regardless of substrate stiffness, contradicting principle (i). All subsequent claims, which are predicated on unchanged or increased tension, are therefore incorrect. Force is a prerequisite for tension-dependent processes, even on stiff substrates.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Cell-averaged traction stress decreases modestly; vinculin intensity is unchanged but zyxin increases as a repair response; talin FRET efficiency is unchanged because talin stretch is force-insensitive; FAK pY$397$ decreases while paxillin pY$118$ is unchanged; actin retrograde flow is unchanged; YAP/TAZ nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio is unchanged because nuclear import depends only on substrate stiffness.**\nThis option makes several factually incorrect statements that violate the principles. Talin is a canonical force sensor, so stating its stretch is \"force-insensitive\" contradicts principle (ii). Vinculin intensity must change as its binding sites are force-dependent. Actin retrograde flow must change due to altered coupling (principle v). YAP/TAZ localization is sensitive to tension, not just substrate stiffness (principle iv). The decrease in stress from $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ blebbistatin would be substantial, not modest.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Cell-averaged traction stress decreases; vinculin intensity decreases but zyxin intensity increases as low tension preferentially recruits zyxin; talin FRET efficiency increases; FAK pY$397$ increases due to enhanced integrin clustering at low force; actin retrograde flow increases; YAP/TAZ nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio increases due to reduced cytoskeletal opposition to nuclear translocation.**\nThis option contains a mixture of correct and incorrect statements with faulty reasoning. While it correctly states that traction stress decreases, vinculin decreases, talin FRET increases, and actin flow increases, it incorrectly claims that zyxin increases, FAK pY$397$ increases, and the YAP/TAZ ratio increases. The justification for zyxin increase is incorrect (zyxin is a tension sensor). The justification for FAK pY$397$ increase is speculative and contradicts principle (iv). The justification for the YAP/TAZ ratio increase misinterprets the mechanism; cytoskeletal tension is required for nuclear import, so its reduction decreases the ratio.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis of the given principles, Option A is the only one that presents a complete and correct set of consequences for the inhibition of actomyosin contractility.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2948826"}]}
