[@problem_id:2944951]", "problem": "A mammalian messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) is translated by the cap-dependent scanning mechanism: the small ribosomal subunit binds the $5'$ cap, scans the $5'$ untranslated region (UTR), and typically initiates at the first start codon in a favorable local context. Positions flanking the start codon influence the probability that the preinitiation complex will convert from a scanning-competent to a start-codon-recognizing state. Positions are numbered relative to the adenine of the AUG start codon as $+1$, with upstream nucleotides assigned negative numbers (for example, position $-3$) and downstream nucleotides assigned positive numbers (for example, position $+4$). The initiator methionyl transfer ribonucleic acid (Met-tRNA) anticodon pairs with the AUG in the ribosomal peptidyl (P) site, and recognition stringency is modulated by the local sequence context according to empirically established Kozak rules.\n\nYou are given four otherwise identical mRNAs that differ only in the two flanking nucleotides at positions $-3$ and $+4$ relative to the AUG codon. In all variants, positions $-2$ and $-1$ are cytosines, there are no upstream start codons, and the $5'$ UTR is unstructured and identical outside the indicated window.

Strongest to weakest: C, A, B, D", "solution": "### Derivation of Solution\nThe solution requires applying the empirically derived Kozak rules for translation initiation in vertebrates. The consensus sequence for efficient initiation is often summarized as $gccRccAUGG$, where $R$ represents a purine (adenine, $A$, or guanine, $G$). The most critical nucleotides for determining initiation efficiency are at position $-3$ and, to a lesser extent, position $+4$.\n\nThe hierarchy of importance for these positions is as follows:\n1.  **Position $-3$**: This is the most influential position. A purine ($G$ or $A$) at this position is strongly preferred for efficient initiation. A guanine ($G$) is considered optimal, followed closely by adenine ($A$). A pyrimidine (cytosine, $C$, or uracil, $U$) at this position results in a \"weak\" Kozak context and significantly lower initiation efficiency.\n2.  **Position $+4$**: This position has a secondary, but significant, effect. A guanine ($G$) at this position is optimal and enhances initiation efficiency, particularly when the $-3$ position is suboptimal.\n\nBased on these principles, we will evaluate each variant. The efficiency is primarily determined by the nucleotide at position $-3$. If two variants have a nucleotide of similar strength at $-3$ (e.g., both purines or both pyrimidines), the nucleotide at $+4$ becomes the deciding factor. The dominant effect of the $-3$ position means that a sequence with a purine at $-3$ will almost always be stronger than a sequence with a pyrimidine at $-3$, regardless of the identity of the nucleotide at $+4$.\n\nLet us analyze the four variants:\n- **Variant A**: Sequence context $G C C AUG G$.\n  - Position $-3$: $G$ (purine, optimal). This confers a very strong context.\n  - Position $+4$: $G$ (optimal). This further enhances the already strong context.\n  - Conclusion: This variant represents the ideal Kozak consensus sequence among the choices and is expected to have the **strongest** initiation efficiency.\n\n- **Variant B**: Sequence context $A C C AUG U$.\n  - Position $-3$: $A$ (purine, suboptimal but strong). This confers a strong context.\n  - Position $+4$: $U$ (pyrimidine, weak). This does not contribute to enhancement.\n  - Conclusion: The strength of the purine at $-3$ makes this a relatively strong context, but it is weaker than Variant A due to the identity at both $-3$ ($A$ vs. $G$) and $+4$ ($U$ vs. $G$).\n\n- **Variant C**: Sequence context $C C C AUG G$.\n  - Position $-3$: $C$ (pyrimidine, weak). This confers a weak context.\n  - Position $+4$: $G$ (optimal). This provides some compensatory enhancement.\n  - Conclusion: This is a weak context due to the pyrimidine at $-3$. The optimal $G$ at $+4$ makes it stronger than other contexts with a weak $-3$ position but cannot fully compensate for the deficit at $-3$. Crucially, it will be significantly weaker than any context with a purine at $-3$.\n\n- **Variant D**: Sequence context $U C C AUG A$.\n  - Position $-3$: $U$ (pyrimidine, weak). This confers a weak context, similar to $C$.\n  - Position $+4$: $A$ (purine, suboptimal). This provides some enhancement, but less than $G$.\n  - Conclusion: This is a weak context due to the pyrimidine at $-3$. The enhancement from $A$ at $+4$ is less than the enhancement from $G$ at $+4$ in Variant C. This is expected to be the **weakest** or second weakest context.\n\nNow we establish the final ranking:\n1.  **A vs. B**: Variant A ($G$ at $-3$, $G$ at $+4$) is superior to Variant B ($A$ at $-3$, $U$ at $+4$) at both critical positions. Therefore, **$A > B$**.\n2.  **B vs. C**: Variant B has a strong purine ($A$) at $-3$, while Variant C has a weak pyrimidine ($C$) at $-3$. The overwhelming importance of the $-3$ position dictates that Variant B will have a much higher initiation efficiency than Variant C, despite Variant C having a better nucleotide at $+4$. Therefore, **$B > C$**.\n3.  **C vs. D**: Both variants have a weak pyrimidine at position $-3$. We must therefore compare them based on position $+4$. Variant C has an optimal $G$, while Variant D has a suboptimal $A$. Therefore, **$C > D$**.\n\nCombining these pairwise comparisons yields the final order from strongest to weakest initiation efficiency:\n**A > B > C > D**\n\nThis ordering matches option A. Variant A is optimal. Variant B follows, with its strong $-3$ purine correctly prioritized over the weak $-3$ pyrimidine of Variant C. Variant C is correctly ranked above Variant D based on a more favorable nucleotide at the secondary position $+4$. Option B is incorrect because it wrongly suggests that the nucleotide at position $+4$ is more important than the one at position $-3$. Option C is incorrect as Variant A is superior to Variant B at both key positions. Option D is fundamentally flawed as it places a variant with a weak pyrimidine at the critical $-3$ position as the strongest initiator.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2944951"}, {"introduction": "When a scanning ribosome encounters a start codon in a weak context, it does not always initiate. It may 'leak' past and continue scanning downstream, a phenomenon central to translational control by upstream open reading frames (uORFs). This practice moves beyond qualitative rules to a quantitative model of leaky scanning, allowing you to calculate the precise impact of an upstream start codon ($uAUG$) on the expression of a main protein. Mastering this probabilistic concept is key to understanding how gene expression is regulated. [@problem_id:2944908]", "problem": "In cap-dependent eukaryotic translation initiation, the small ribosomal subunit forms a $43\\mathrm{S}$ preinitiation complex (PIC) and binds the $5'$ cap, then scans the $5'$ untranslated region until it encounters an AUG codon. The probability of initiating at a given AUG depends on the local Kozak sequence context, and under the leaky scanning framework, the PIC recognizes an AUG with a context-dependent probability on each encounter; PICs that do not recognize an AUG continue scanning. Consider a messenger RNA (mRNA) whose main open reading frame (ORF) begins at a main AUG in an optimal Kozak context such that, in the absence of any upstream AUG, the baseline probability of initiation at the main AUG upon a single scan is $p_{\\text{main}} = 0.88$. Now suppose a single-nucleotide variant introduces one upstream AUG that creates an upstream ORF (uORF). The upstream AUG has a moderate Kozak context such that the probability of initiation at this upstream AUG upon a scan is $p_{\\text{uAUG}} = 0.4$. Assume the following biologically realistic conditions: (i) there is a single $43\\mathrm{S}$ PIC loading event per mRNA per scan, (ii) scanning is unidirectional from $5'$ to $3'$, (iii) there is negligible reinitiation after translating the uORF owing to a short intercistronic distance and efficient termination, and (iv) recognition events at distinct AUGs are independent conditional on the PIC reaching them. Using only these principles and assumptions, derive from first principles an expression for the probability of initiation at the main AUG with and without the upstream AUG, then compute the absolute decrease in the main ORF initiation probability due to the introduced upstream AUG. Express your final answer as a decimal fraction and round to four significant figures.", "solution": "Let us define the probabilities given in the problem. The baseline probability of a preinitiation complex (PIC) initiating translation at the main start codon (AUG), in the absence of any upstream AUG codons, is $p_{\\text{main}} = 0.88$. This main AUG is in an optimal Kozak context. A variant introduces an upstream AUG (uAUG) in a moderate Kozak context, at which a scanning PIC will initiate with probability $p_{\\text{uAUG}} = 0.4$.\n\nWe must derive the probability of initiation at the main AUG in two scenarios: without and with the uAUG.\n\nCase 1: Initiation probability without the upstream AUG.\nIn this scenario, a $43\\mathrm{S}$ PIC is loaded onto the $5'$ end of the mRNA and scans unidirectionally towards the $3'$ end. The first AUG it encounters is the main AUG. According to the problem statement, the probability of initiating translation upon encountering this AUG is given directly. Let $P_{\\text{no uORF}}$ be the probability of initiation at the main ORF in this configuration.\n$$P_{\\text{no uORF}} = p_{\\text{main}}$$\nSubstituting the given value, we have:\n$$P_{\\text{no uORF}} = 0.88$$\n\nCase 2: Initiation probability with the upstream AUG.\nIn this scenario, the PIC first encounters the uAUG. The core principle of leaky scanning is that the PIC may either initiate at this uAUG or \"leak\" past it and continue scanning.\nThe probability of the PIC initiating at the uAUG is $p_{\\text{uAUG}}$.\nThe complementary event, that the PIC does not initiate at the uAUG and continues scanning, has a probability of $1 - p_{\\text{uAUG}}$.\nFor an initiation event to occur at the main AUG, two sequential and independent events (conditional on the PIC reaching each site) must occur:\n1. The PIC must first bypass the uAUG without initiating. The probability of this event is $(1 - p_{\\text{uAUG}})$.\n2. Having bypassed the uAUG, the PIC must then successfully initiate at the main AUG. The probability of this second event, given that the PIC has reached the main AUG, is $p_{\\text{main}}$.\n\nLet $P_{\\text{with uORF}}$ be the probability of initiation at the main ORF in the presence of the uAUG. This is the joint probability of the two events described above. Given the assumption that recognition events at distinct AUGs are independent, we can multiply their probabilities:\n$$P_{\\text{with uORF}} = P(\\text{bypass uAUG}) \\times P(\\text{initiate at main AUG} | \\text{bypassed uAUG})$$\n$$P_{\\text{with uORF}} = (1 - p_{\\text{uAUG}}) \\times p_{\\text{main}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P_{\\text{with uORF}} = (1 - 0.4) \\times 0.88$$\n$$P_{\\text{with uORF}} = 0.6 \\times 0.88 = 0.528$$\n\nThe problem asks for the absolute decrease in the main ORF initiation probability due to the introduced uAUG. Let this decrease be $\\Delta P$. This is calculated as the difference between the initiation probability without the uAUG and with the uAUG.\n$$\\Delta P = P_{\\text{no uORF}} - P_{\\text{with uORF}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$\\Delta P = p_{\\text{main}} - (1 - p_{\\text{uAUG}}) \\times p_{\\text{main}}$$\nWe can factor out $p_{\\text{main}}$ to simplify the expression:\n$$\\Delta P = p_{\\text{main}} (1 - (1 - p_{\\text{uAUG}}))$$\n$$\\Delta P = p_{\\text{main}} (1 - 1 + p_{\\text{uAUG}})$$\n$$\\Delta P = p_{\\text{main}} \\times p_{\\text{uAUG}}$$\nThis shows that the absolute decrease in initiation at the main ORF is equal to the product of the initiation probabilities at the two respective AUG codons.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\\Delta P = 0.88 \\times 0.4$$\n$$\\Delta P = 0.352$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\Delta P = 0.3520$$\nThis value represents the fraction of PICs that would have initiated at the main ORF but are now captured by the newly introduced upstream start codon.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3520}$$", "id": "2944908"}, {"introduction": "A core skill for a molecular biologist is to move from observing a genetic variant to understanding its mechanism of action.

A sound experimental strategy must be able to distinguish between these two possibilities. Several of the proposed experiments achieve this.\n\n**Designs A, B, and C** represent three classic and direct approaches to solve this problem. **(A)** Directly measuring both protein and mRNA levels allows for the calculation of translational efficiency (protein-to-mRNA ratio). An initiation defect would lower this ratio, while an mRNA stability defect would lower both protein and mRNA proportionally, leaving the ratio unchanged. **(B)** An mRNA half-life experiment using a transcription inhibitor like actinomycin D directly tests stability. If the variant's half-life is shorter, stability is the issue; if the half-life is unchanged, the defect must be in translation. **(C)** Polysome profiling provides a snapshot of translation in action. A translation initiation defect would cause the variant mRNA to shift from heavily translating polysomes to lighter fractions, whereas a stability defect would reduce the total amount of mRNA across all fractions without changing its distribution.\n\n**Design D** offers a clever mechanistic test. It replaces the canonical cap-dependent scanning mechanism—the very process the mutation is expected to affect—with an IRES. If the difference between wild-type and variant disappears, it confirms the defect is specific to scanning-based initiation. If the difference persists, it points to a more general property of the mRNA, such as its intrinsic stability.\n\nIn contrast, **designs E and F** are flawed. **(E)** Knocking down UPF1 only tests for the Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) pathway. It cannot rule out other stability-related mechanisms, and more importantly, it confounds cause and effect, as NMD can be a downstream consequence of the primary initiation defect (leaky scanning). **(F)** Using cycloheximide, an elongation inhibitor, simply freezes the pre-existing protein levels and provides no new information to differentiate the underlying cause of the difference.\n\nTherefore, experimental designs A, B, C, and D are all valid and decisive methods for discriminating between an initiation defect and an mRNA stability defect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCD}$$", "id": "2944953"}]}
