In the capillarity approximation for hydrophobic hydration, the reversible work to expose a nonpolar surface to water is taken to be proportional to its area, with a temperature-dependent nonpolar solvation parameter $\\sigma$ that is positive for exposure to water.

Express the final energy in $\\text{kcal}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$.", "solution": "The problem asks for a derivation of the Gibbs free energy contribution from the burial of a nonpolar surface during protein folding, a numerical evaluation of this term, an assessment of its impact on stability, and a commentary on the temperature dependence of the underlying physical parameter.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the change in standard Gibbs free energy of folding, $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$, due to the hydrophobic effect as modeled by the capillarity approximation. The problem states that the reversible work, $W_{rev}$, to *expose* a nonpolar surface of area $A_{exposed}$ to water is proportional to its area. In thermodynamics, the reversible work done on a system at constant temperature and pressure is equal to the change in its Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta G$. Therefore, the Gibbs free energy change for exposing a nonpolar surface to water is:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{exposure} = \\sigma A_{exposed}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the nonpolar solvation parameter, $\\sigma$, is positive. This correctly reflects the thermodynamic penalty for transferring nonpolar species into an aqueous environment, a phenomenon known as the hydrophobic effect.\n\nProtein folding is the process that transitions a protein from an unfolded, denatured state ($U$) to a folded, native state ($F$). This process involves the *burial* of nonpolar surface area, which was previously exposed to the solvent in the unfolded state. This burial is the reverse of the exposure process described above. Let $A_{U, nonpolar}$ be the solvent-accessible nonpolar surface area in the unfolded state and $A_{F, nonpolar}$ be the corresponding area in the folded state. The change in exposed nonpolar surface area upon folding is:\n$$\n\\Delta A_{exposed, fold} = A_{F, nonpolar} - A_{U, nonpolar}\n$$\nThe problem defines $A$ as the area of nonpolar surface that is *buried* upon folding. This means $A = A_{U, nonpolar} - A_{F, nonpolar}$. It follows that the change in exposed area is the negative of the buried area:\n$$\n\\Delta A_{exposed, fold} = -A\n$$\nThe contribution of this process to the total Gibbs free energy of folding, which the problem denotes as $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$, is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{fold}} = \\sigma \\cdot \\Delta A_{exposed, fold} = \\sigma (-A) = -\\sigma A\n$$\nSince both $\\sigma$ and $A$ are positive quantities ($\\sigma > 0$ by definition, $A > 0$ for any non-trivial folding process), the sign of $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ is unequivocally negative.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression using the provided values: $A = 1000\\,\\text{\\AA}^2$ and $\\sigma = 25\\,\\text{cal}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{\\AA}^{-2}$.\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{fold}} = - (25\\,\\text{cal}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{\\AA}^{-2}) \\times (1000\\,\\text{\\AA}^2)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{fold}} = -25000\\,\\text{cal}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in units of $\\text{kcal}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$. Since $1\\,\\text{kcal} = 1000\\,\\text{cal}$, we perform the conversion:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{fold}} = -25000\\,\\text{cal}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\text{kcal}}{1000\\,\\text{cal}} = -25\\,\\text{kcal}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\n$$\nThe given value for $\\sigma$ has two significant figures, so the final calculated value should also be reported to two significant figures. The result $-25\\,\\text{kcal}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$ is already in this form.\n\nA negative value for a change in Gibbs free energy ($\\Delta G < 0$) indicates that a process is thermodynamically favorable and spontaneous under the given conditions. In the context of protein folding, a negative contribution to the overall $\\Delta G_{\\text{fold}}$ implies that this particular energetic term helps to stabilize the folded state relative to the unfolded state. Therefore, the burial of $1000\\,\\text{\\AA}^2$ of nonpolar surface area provides a strong stabilizing contribution of $-25\\,\\text{kcal}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$ to the folded protein structure.\n\nFinally, we comment on the temperature dependence of the nonpolar solvation parameter, $\\sigma$. The parameter $\\sigma$ is the specific Gibbs free energy of solvation per unit area, $\\sigma(T) = \\frac{\\Delta G_{solv}(T)}{A}$. The Gibbs free energy itself is defined as $\\Delta G_{solv}(T) = \\Delta H_{solv}(T) - T \\Delta S_{solv}(T)$, where $\\Delta H_{solv}$ and $\\Delta S_{solv}$ are the enthalpy and entropy of solvation, respectively. The temperature dependence of these quantities is governed by the heat capacity change of solvation, $\\Delta C_{p,solv} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\Delta H_{solv}}{\\partial T}\\right)_p$. A hallmark physical property of hydrophobic hydration is a large, positive value for $\\Delta C_{p,solv}$.\n\nThis large, positive $\\Delta C_{p,solv}$ causes both $\\Delta H_{solv}$ and $\\Delta S_{solv}$ to increase significantly with temperature. At low temperatures (near $0^\\circ\\text{C}$), both $\\Delta H_{solv}$ and $\\Delta S_{solv}$ for exposing a nonpolar surface are negative. The unfavorable nature of hydration ($\\Delta G_{solv} > 0$) is driven by the large negative entropy term ($-T\\Delta S_{solv} > 0$). As temperature increases, $\\Delta H_{solv}$ increases, crossing zero and becoming positive. The consequence is that $\\Delta G_{solv}(T)$, and thus $\\sigma(T)$, exhibits a non-monotonic, approximately parabolic dependence on temperature. This means that the strength of the hydrophobic effect is not constant with temperature. The stability contribution to folding, which is proportional to $-\\sigma(T)$, is maximal at a specific temperature (typically around $20-40^\\circ\\text{C}$ for many proteins) and decreases at both higher and lower temperatures. This phenomenon is the thermodynamic basis for both heat-induced denaturation and cold denaturation of proteins. The unique hydrogen-bonding network and high heat capacity of liquid water are the fundamental physical properties that control this behavior.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-25}\n$$", "id": "2960546"}, {"introduction": "While global stability metrics tell us if a protein folds, they do not reveal how its individual parts work together to create a stable, functional structure.
