It provides a minimal but formalizable model of a molecular motor, rooted in the established principles of statistical mechanics and chemical kinetics. All necessary information is provided for a rigorous derivation. Therefore, we proceed to the solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle connecting the kinetics of an elementary transition to its thermodynamics is the condition of local detailed balance. For each transition $i$ between two states, the ratio of the forward rate constant, $k_i^{+}$, to the reverse rate constant, $k_i^{-}$, is determined by the standard Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G_i$, for that step:\n$$\n\\frac{k_i^{+}}{k_i^{-}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_i}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. This relation holds for each of the $4$ transitions in the cycle.\n\nWe are asked to analyze the product of these ratios around the entire cycle, which we define as $R$:\n$$\nR \\equiv \\prod_{i=1}^{4} \\frac{k_i^{+}}{k_i^{-}}\n$$\nSubstituting the local detailed balance condition for each step into this product gives:\n$$\nR = \\prod_{i=1}^{4} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_i}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{k_B T} \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\Delta G_i\\right)\n$$\nThe sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\Delta G_i$ represents the total Gibbs free energy change over one complete forward cycle, which we denote as $\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}}$.\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}} = \\Delta G_1 + \\Delta G_2 + \\Delta G_3 + \\Delta G_4\n$$\nTherefore, the ratio $R$ is directly related to the total free energy change of the cycle:\n$$\nR = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}}}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n\nFirst, we consider the hypothetical equilibrium chaperone. The system is at thermodynamic equilibrium. A defining feature of equilibrium is that any cyclic process must have a net Gibbs free energy change of zero. This is because Gibbs free energy is a state function, and returning to the initial state must restore the initial free energy. In this specific case, the condition for equilibrium is given by $\\Delta \\mu \\equiv \\mu_{\\mathrm{ATP}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{ADP}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{P_i}} = 0$. Since the net chemical transformation in the cycle is the hydrolysis of ATP, which under this condition has no free energy change, the entire cycle is at equilibrium. Thus, $\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}} = 0$.\nSubstituting this into our expression for the product of rate ratios:\n$$\n\\prod_{i=1}^{4} \\frac{k_i^{+}}{k_i^{-}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp(0) = 1\n$$\nThis is the condition of global detailed balance. It implies that $\\prod_{i=1}^{4} k_i^{+} = \\prod_{i=1}^{4} k_i^{-}$, meaning the rate of the forward cycle is exactly balanced by the rate of the reverse cycle, resulting in zero net flux at steady state.\n\nNext, we consider the Hsp70 cycle, which operates under non-equilibrium conditions sustained by chemostatted pools of nucleotides where $\\Delta \\mu > 0$. The problem states that one forward completion of the cycle $X_1 \\to X_2 \\to X_3 \\to X_4 \\to X_1$ results in the net conversion of one molecule of ATP to one molecule of ADP and one inorganic phosphate $\\mathrm{P_i}$. The net reaction is $\\mathrm{ATP} \\to \\mathrm{ADP} + \\mathrm{P_i}$.\nThe Gibbs free energy change for this net reaction is $\\Delta G_{\\text{hydrolysis}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{ADP}} + \\mu_{\\mathrm{P_i}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$.\nUsing the problem's definition $\\Delta \\mu = \\mu_{\\mathrm{ATP}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{ADP}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{P_i}}$, we have $\\Delta G_{\\text{hydrolysis}} = -\\Delta\\mu$.\nSince the internal states of the chaperone-substrate complex return to their initial configuration after one cycle, the total free energy change for the cycle, $\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}}$, must be equal to the free energy change of the net chemical reaction that fuels it.\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}} = \\Delta G_{\\text{hydrolysis}} = -\\Delta\\mu\n$$\nThe violation of global detailed balance is quantified by the ratio $R$. We substitute this non-zero cyclic free energy change into our expression for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\text{cycle}}}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(-\\Delta\\mu)}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\mu}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nSince $\\Delta \\mu > 0$, it follows that $R > 1$. This signifies that $\\prod k_i^{+} > \\prod k_i^{-}$, proving that global detailed balance is violated and there is a net, directed flux through the cycle, driven by the free energy of ATP hydrolysis.\n\nFinally, we are required to evaluate $R$ for the specific condition $\\Delta \\mu / (k_B T) = 20$.\nUsing the derived formula for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\mu}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp(20)\n$$\nCalculating the value of $\\exp(20)$:\n$$\nR \\approx 485165195.4\n$$\nThe problem requires this answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.

The definition is $K_d = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}$.\n\nFor peptide A:\n$$K_{d,\\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off,A}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on,A}}} = \\frac{3.0\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1.5 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M}$$\nTo express this in micromolar units, we use the conversion $1\\ \\mathrm{M} = 10^{6}\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n$$K_{d,\\mathrm{A}} = (2.0 \\times 10^{-6})\\ \\mathrm{M} \\times \\frac{10^{6}\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}}{1\\ \\mathrm{M}} = 2.0\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\n\nFor peptide B:\n$$K_{d,\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off,B}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on,B}}} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{7.5 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.15}{7.5 \\times 10^{5}}\\ \\mathrm{M} = 0.2 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{M}$$\nIn micromolar units:\n$$K_{d,\\mathrm{B}} = (2.0 \\times 10^{-7})\\ \\mathrm{M} \\times \\frac{10^{6}\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}}{1\\ \\mathrm{M}} = 0.20\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\n\nPart 2: Derivation of Mean Bound Dwell Time\nWe are tasked with deriving the mean time to absorption into the dissociated state $D$, starting from the open-lid bound state $O$. This is a classic mean first passage time problem. Let $\\tau_O$ and $\\tau_L$ be the mean times to absorption in $D$, starting from states $O$ and $L$, respectively. The process starts in state $O$, so the quantity of interest is $\\tau_O$.\n\nThe mean time to absorption from a state $i$ in a continuous-time Markov process can be found by conditioning on the first transition. For any state $i$, the mean time spent in that state before a transition is $1/\\lambda_i$, where $\\lambda_i$ is the total exit rate from state $i$. After this time, the process moves to a state $j$ with probability $p_{ij} = k_{ij}/\\lambda_i$, and the remaining mean time to absorption is $\\tau_j$. This gives the general relation:\n$$\\tau_i = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_i} + \\sum_{j} p_{ij} \\tau_j$$\n\nFor our system:\nThe states are $O$ and $L$. The state $D$ is absorbing, so its mean absorption time is $\\tau_D = 0$.\n\nFor state $O$, the possible transitions are to state $D$ with rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ and to state $L$ with rate $k_{\\mathrm{cl}}$. The total exit rate is $\\lambda_O = k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{cl}}$. The equation for $\\tau_O$ is:\n$$\\tau_O = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{cl}}} + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{cl}}}\\tau_D + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cl}}}{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{cl}}}\\tau_L$$\nSince $\\tau_D = 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$[1] \\quad \\tau_O = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{cl}}} + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cl}}}{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{cl}}}\\tau_L$$\n\nFor state $L$, the only possible transition is to state $O$ with rate $k_{\\mathrm{op}}$. The total exit rate is $\\lambda_L = k_{\\mathrm{op}}$. The equation for $\\tau_L$ is:\n$$\\tau_L = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{op}}} + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{op}}}{k_{\\mathrm{op}}}\\tau_O$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$[2] \\quad \\tau_L = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{op}}} + \\tau_O$$\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for $\\tau_O$ and $\\tau_L$. We solve for $\\tau_O$ by substituting equation $[2]$ into equation $[1]$:\n$$\\tau_O = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{cl}}} + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cl}}}{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{cl}}} \\left( \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{op}}} + \\tau_O \\right)$$\nTo solve for $\\tau_O$, we first multiply by $(k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{cl}})$:\n$$\\tau_O (k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{cl}}) = 1 + k_{\\mathrm{cl}} \\left( \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{op}}} + \\tau_O \\right)$$\n$$\\tau_O k_{\\mathrm{off}} + \\tau_O k_{\\mathrm{cl}} = 1 + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cl}}}{k_{\\mathrm{op}}} + \\tau_O k_{\\mathrm{cl}}$$\nThe term $\\tau_O k_{\\mathrm{cl}}$ cancels on both sides:\n$$\\tau_O k_{\\mathrm{off}} = 1 + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cl}}}{k_{\\mathrm{op}}}$$\nFinally, we isolate $\\tau_O$, which represents the mean bound dwell time, $\\langle t_{dwell} \\rangle$:\n$$\\langle t_{dwell} \\rangle = \\tau_O = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cl}}}{k_{\\mathrm{op}}} \\right)$$\nThis is the desired expression. It shows that the mean dwell time is the intrinsic lifetime $1/k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ multiplied by a factor that accounts for the time spent in the transiently trapped state $L$.\n\nPart 3: Calculation of Fold-Change in Mean Dwell Time\nWe are asked to compute the fold-change in the mean bound dwell time for peptide A when the lid closure rate $k_{\\mathrm{cl}}$ is increased from $k_{\\mathrm{cl,low}}$ to $k_{\\mathrm{cl,high}}$. The fold-change is the ratio of the new dwell time to the old dwell time.\n\nLet $\\langle t_{dwell} \\rangle_{\\mathrm{low}}$ be the mean dwell time with $k_{\\mathrm{cl}} = k_{\\mathrm{cl,low}}$ and $\\langle t_{dwell} \\rangle_{\\mathrm{high}}$ be the mean dwell time with $k_{\\mathrm{cl}} = k_{\\mathrm{cl,high}}$.\nUsing the derived expression:\n$$\\langle t_{dwell} \\rangle_{\\mathrm{low}} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{off,A}}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cl,low}}}{k_{\\mathrm{op}}} \\right)$$\n$$\\langle t_{dwell} \\rangle_{\\mathrm{high}} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{off,A}}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cl,high}}}{k_{\\mathrm{op}}} \\right)$$\nThe fold-change is their ratio:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{\\langle t_{dwell} \\rangle_{\\mathrm{high}}}{\\langle t_{dwell} \\rangle_{\\mathrm{low}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{off,A}}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cl,high}}}{k_{\\mathrm{op}}} \\right)}{\\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{off,A}}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cl,low}}}{k_{\\mathrm{op}}} \\right)} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cl,high}}}{k_{\\mathrm{op}}}}{1 + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cl,low}}}{k_{\\mathrm{op}}}}$$\nNote that the fold-change is independent of the peptide's intrinsic off-rate, $k_{\\mathrm{off,A}}$. We now substitute the given numerical values:\n$k_{\\mathrm{cl,low}} = 0.5\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{cl,high}} = 5.0\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{op}} = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{5.0\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1.0\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}}{1 + \\frac{0.5\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1.0\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}} = \\frac{1 + 5.0}{1 + 0.5} = \\frac{6.0}{1.5} = 4.0$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

Maximal Steady-State Throughput**\n\nThe throughput is the rate at which the machine processes client proteins. The GroEL-GroES machine operates via an alternating \"two-stroke\" mechanism. One ring encapsulates a client (the cis ring), while the other is open (the trans ring).\n\nA complete cycle for processing one client in one ring involves two main steps:\n- The cis encapsulation dwell time, $t_{\\mathrm{cis}} = 9.7\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n- The exchange time, $t_{\\mathrm{ex}} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{s}$, during which the client is released and the rings reconfigure.\n\nThe problem states that a new encapsulation event (in the opposite ring, which now becomes the new cis ring) initiates immediately after the exchange process. This means that the time elapsed from the beginning of one encapsulation event to the beginning of the next one is the sum of the cis dwell time and the exchange time. This represents the time required to process one client.\nLet $t_{\\text{cycle}}$ be the time per client.\n$$t_{\\text{cycle}} = t_{\\mathrm{cis}} + t_{\\mathrm{ex}}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$t_{\\text{cycle}} = 9.7\\,\\mathrm{s} + 0.8\\,\\mathrm{s} = 10.5\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n\nThe maximal steady-state throughput, $R$, is the reciprocal of this cycle time:\n$$R = \\frac{1}{t_{\\text{cycle}}} = \\frac{1}{10.5\\,\\mathrm{s}}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the throughput in units of clients per minute. We convert the units by multiplying by $60\\,\\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{min}$:\n$$R_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{1}{10.5\\,\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\frac{60\\,\\mathrm{s}}{1\\,\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{60}{10.5}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$$\n$$R_{\\text{min}} \\approx 5.7142857\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the maximal throughput is $5.714$ clients per minute.\n\nThe final answer is a row matrix containing the two calculated values, rounded to four significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{bmatrix} 6.855 & 5.714 \\end{bmatrix}}$$", "id": "2938328"}]}
