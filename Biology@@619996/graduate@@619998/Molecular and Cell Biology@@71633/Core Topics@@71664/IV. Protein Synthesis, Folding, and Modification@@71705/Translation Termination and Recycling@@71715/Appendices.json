This exercise challenges you to think like a protein engineer, using foundational principles of structure-function relationships to solve a real biological puzzle: how to selectively weaken termination at a single stop codon to allow for an alternative decoding event, such as selenocysteine incorporation. By analyzing the specific molecular interactions between eRF1 and the ribosome, you can propose targeted mutations and predict their biochemical consequences, a core skill in modern molecular genetics [@problem_id:2967322].", "problem": "A ribosome translating a human selenoprotein messenger RNA (mRNA) must decode the UGA triplet as selenocysteine rather than as a stop signal. In eukaryotes, translation termination at UAA, UAG, and UGA is mediated by eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1), stimulated by eukaryotic release factor 3 (eRF3) and guanosine triphosphate (GTP). In selenoprotein mRNAs, a Selenocysteine Insertion Sequence (SECIS) in the $3'$ untranslated region (UTR) recruits SECIS-binding protein 2 (SBP2) and the dedicated eukaryotic elongation factor for selenocysteine (eEFSec) with $Sec-tRNA^{\\text{Sec}}$ to promote recoding specifically at UGA. Consider the following foundational principles:\n- Stop codon recognition by eRF1 involves its N-terminal domain, with distinct conserved motifs contributing to recognition of each nucleotide of the stop codon. Empirically, the NIKS motif contributes to recognizing $U$ in the first position, a so-called GTS loop contributes to discriminating $A$ versus $G$ in the second position, and a YxCxxxF motif contributes to recognizing a purine in the third position.\n- Adenine and guanine differ in their hydrogen-bonding patterns: guanine presents an O6 carbonyl acceptor and an N2 exocyclic amine donor, whereas adenine presents an N6 exocyclic amine donor and lacks the O6 carbonyl.\n- At a recoding-competent UGA within a bona fide SECIS context, the probability that the ribosome inserts selenocysteine rather than terminates can be modeled as a kinetic competition between eRF1–eRF3–GTP-mediated termination and eEFSec–$Sec-tRNA^{\\text{Sec}}$ delivery, such that reducing the effective on-rate or binding energy of eRF1 specifically at UGA increases the fraction of Sec insertion, provided that termination at UAA and UAG remains efficient to avoid deleterious global readthrough.\n\nYou are tasked with selecting a mutation strategy in eRF1 that selectively weakens UGA recognition to facilitate selenocysteine incorporation in SECIS-dependent contexts, without globally elevating readthrough at UAA or UAG. Choose the option that best satisfies the biochemical selectivity constraints and justify the choice implicitly by your selection.\n\nWhich of the following eRF1 mutation strategies is most consistent with selectively reducing UGA recognition while preserving efficient termination at UAA and UAG?\n\nA. Introduce a threonine-to-valine substitution at the threonine of the GTS loop in domain $1$ ($T \\rightarrow V$ at the GTS loop), leaving the NIKS and YxCxxxF motifs unaltered.\n\nB. Replace the asparagine of the NIKS motif with alanine ($N \\rightarrow A$ in NIKS), leaving other motifs unaltered.\n\nC. Replace the tyrosine of the YxCxxxF motif with alanine ($Y \\rightarrow A$ in YxCxxxF), leaving other motifs unaltered.\n\nD. Mutate one glycine of the catalytic GGQ motif in domain $2$ to alanine ($G \\rightarrow A$ in GGQ), leaving domain $1$ unchanged.\n\nE. Introduce a serine-to-asparagine substitution at the serine of the GTS loop in domain $1$ ($S \\rightarrow N$ at the GTS loop), leaving the NIKS and YxCxxxF motifs unaltered.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation and is found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular biology, specifically translation termination and selenocysteine incorporation. The problem is well-posed, objective, and internally consistent, providing sufficient information to deduce a unique solution.\n\nThe central task is to devise a mutation strategy for eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) that selectively impairs its ability to recognize the `UGA` stop codon, thereby promoting selenocysteine incorporation at such sites, while maintaining efficient termination at `UAA` and `UAG` codons. This requires a detailed analysis of the molecular interactions between eRF1 and the three stop codons.\n\nThe three stop codons are `UAA`, `UAG`, and `UGA`. The basis for selective targeting of `UGA` recognition must lie in the structural differences between these codons.\n- Codon 1: `UAA`\n- Codon 2: `UAG`\n- Codon 3: `UGA`\n\nThe first nucleotide position is occupied by uracil (`U`) in all three cases. The provided information states that the `NIKS` motif of eRF1 contributes to recognizing `U` in this first position. Any mutation in this motif would therefore be expected to affect recognition of all three stop codons, which violates the problem's constraint of preserving `UAA` and `UAG` termination efficiency.\n\nThe second nucleotide position is the key point of differentiation. In `UAA` and `UAG`, the second base is adenine (`A`), whereas in `UGA`, it is guanine (`G`). The problem explicitly states that the `GTS` loop of eRF1 is responsible for discriminating `A` versus `G` in this second position. Therefore, any selective mutation must target the function of this `GTS` loop with respect to its interaction with guanine.\n\nThe third nucleotide position is occupied by a purine (`A` or `G`) in all three functional stop codons (`UAA`, `UAG`). The `UGA` codon also has a purine (`A`) in the third position. The `YxCxxxF` motif is said to recognize a purine at this position. A mutation here would likely compromise recognition of `UAA`, `UAG`, and `UGA`, as they all contain a purine at position $3$.\n\nThe biochemical basis for discrimination at the second position is the difference in hydrogen-bonding patterns between adenine and guanine. Guanine possesses an O6 carbonyl group, which acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor, and an N2 exocyclic amine, which is a hydrogen bond donor. Adenine lacks the O6 carbonyl but has an N6 exocyclic amine donor. The unique O6 carbonyl acceptor of guanine is a prime target for specific recognition. To recognize `G` at the second position of `UGA`, the `GTS` loop must present a hydrogen bond donor to interact with this O6 acceptor. The threonine (`T`) and serine (`S`) residues within the `GTS` loop both have hydroxyl (`-OH`) groups in their side chains, which are capable of donating a hydrogen bond.\n\nWith this framework, we evaluate each proposed mutation strategy:\n\nA. Introduce a threonine-to-valine substitution at the threonine of the GTS loop in domain $1$ ($T \\rightarrow V$ at the GTS loop), leaving the NIKS and YxCxxxF motifs unaltered.\nThe `GTS` loop is the correct target for achieving specificity at the second codon position. Threonine (`T`) is a polar amino acid with a hydroxyl (`-OH`) group, which is a hydrogen bond donor. Valine (`V`) is a nonpolar, hydrophobic amino acid. The substitution $T \\rightarrow V$ removes the hydrogen bond donor capability at this position. This would ablate the presumed stabilizing H-bond between the threonine side chain and the O6 carbonyl of the guanine base in the `UGA` codon. Consequently, the binding affinity of eRF1 for `UGA` would be selectively reduced. The recognition of `UAA` and `UAG`, which contain adenine at the second position, would be minimally affected as their recognition relies on different interactions within the pocket, not on the specific H-bond to the guanine O6. This strategy is therefore highly consistent with the stated goal.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. Replace the asparagine of the NIKS motif with alanine ($N \\rightarrow A$ in NIKS), leaving other motifs unaltered.\nThe `NIKS` motif is involved in recognizing the `U` at the first position of the stop codon. Since all three stop codons (`UAA`, `UAG`, `UGA`) begin with `U`, a mutation in this motif would impair recognition of all of them. This would lead to global readthrough, which is explicitly forbidden by the problem constraints.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. Replace the tyrosine of the YxCxxxF motif with alanine ($Y \\rightarrow A$ in YxCxxxF), leaving other motifs unaltered.\nThe `YxCxxxF` motif recognizes the purine (`A` or `G`) at the third position. The stop codons are `UAA`, `UAG`, and `UGA`. This mutation would affect recognition of `A` in `UAA` and `UGA`, and `G` in `UAG`. Tyrosine is an aromatic residue capable of stacking interactions and hydrogen bonding, while alanine is small and non-aromatic. This mutation would likely disrupt termination at all three stop codons, failing the selectivity requirement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. Mutate one glycine of the catalytic GGQ motif in domain $2$ to alanine ($G \\rightarrow A$ in GGQ), leaving domain $1$ unchanged.\nThe problem states that codon recognition occurs in the N-terminal domain (domain $1$) of eRF1. The `GGQ` motif is described as catalytic and located in domain $2$. Its function is related to the hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA ester bond, a step that occurs *after* the stop codon has been recognized. Mutating this motif would impair the catalytic efficiency of termination for all stop codons, rather than selectively affecting the recognition of `UGA`.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nE. Introduce a serine-to-asparagine substitution at the serine of the GTS loop in domain $1$ ($S \\rightarrow N$ at the GTS loop), leaving the NIKS and YxCxxxF motifs unaltered.\nThis mutation targets the correct region, the `GTS` loop. However, it replaces serine (`S`), which has a polar hydroxyl group, with asparagine (`N`), which has a polar amide group. Both side chains are capable of acting as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. This is a relatively conservative substitution. It is not clear that this change would specifically *weaken* the interaction with the guanine in `UGA`. The amide of asparagine might form an equivalent or even stronger hydrogen bond than the hydroxyl of serine. Compared to the $T \\rightarrow V$ mutation in option A, which definitively removes a hydrogen-bonding group and replaces it with a non-interacting hydrophobic group, this $S \\rightarrow N$ substitution is not a reliable strategy for reducing binding affinity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on rigorous analysis, the mutation proposed in option A is the only one that logically and biochemically achieves the desired selective weakening of `UGA` recognition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2967322"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple recognition, the efficiency and regulation of biological processes are governed by kinetics.

Assume that, under the assay conditions described below, the steady-state rate of peptide release as a function of eRF1 concentration obeys Michaelis–Menten kinetics with respect to eRF1. In a fully reconstituted in vitro system with ribosomes programmed with a cognate stop codon, the following steady-state kinetic parameters for eRF1 were measured by varying eRF1 concentration at saturating GTP and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA):\n\n- Condition A (eRF1 alone): $k_{\\text{cat}} = 0.25$ s$^{-1}$ and $K_M = 2.00$ $\\mu$M.\n- Condition B (eRF1 with eRF3·GTP): $k_{\\text{cat}} = 3.00$ s$^{-1}$ and $K_M = 0.500$ $\\mu$M.\n\nUsing only well-established enzyme kinetic principles applicable to Michaelis–Menten systems, compute the fold-change in catalytic efficiency upon addition of eRF3·GTP (Condition B relative to Condition A).

To do this, we must examine the individual contributions of $k_{\\text{cat}}$ and $K_M$ to the overall change in efficiency.

In the Michaelis–Menten model, $K_M$ reflects the substrate concentration at which the reaction velocity is half-maximal. A decrease in $K_M$ indicates an increase in the apparent affinity of eRF1 for the ribosomal complex. Thus, eRF3·GTP enhances the binding or recognition of the stop codon complex by eRF1.\n\nThe overall fold-change in catalytic efficiency ($48$) is the product of the enhancement from the increased catalytic rate (a factor of $12$) and the enhancement from the increased apparent affinity (a factor of $4$, since efficiency is inversely proportional to $K_M$).\n$$\n12 \\times 4 = 48\n$$\nMechanistically, eRF3·GTP acts as a potent activator by improving *both* the binding of eRF1 to the ribosome (reflected in the lower $K_M$) and the rate of the chemical reaction it catalyzes (reflected in the higher $k_{\\text{cat}}$). Both factors contribute significantly to the large increase in catalytic efficiency.\n\nThe final answer requested is the fold-change in catalytic efficiency, rounded to three significant figures.
