Start from the foundational framework of the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and the mechanistic steps of bacterial translation, which couples macromolecular assembly and conformational changes to nucleotide triphosphate hydrolysis. Assume the following empirically established features of bacterial protein synthesis:\n\n- Each aminoacylation of a transfer RNA (tRNA) by an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase consumes one adenosine triphosphate (ATP), hydrolyzed to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate (PPi). Count the initiator methionyl-tRNA among these events. For energetic accounting, treat ATP hydrolyzed to AMP as consuming $2$ high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds.\n- Translation initiation on a bacterial messenger RNA (mRNA) consumes $1$ guanosine triphosphate (GTP) by Initiation Factor 2 (IF2).\n- Each elongation cycle that adds one amino acid to the nascent chain after initiation requires $2$ GTP: one by Elongation Factor Tu (EF-Tu) to deliver the aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site and one by Elongation Factor G (EF-G) to catalyze translocation.\n- Termination and ribosome recycling together consume $2$ additional GTP: one by Release Factor 3 (RF3) to promote release factor turnover and one by EF-G acting with Ribosome Recycling Factor (RRF) to split the post-termination complex.\n\nLet the final polypeptide length be $n$ amino acids.

It provides a set of clear, established premises from molecular biology concerning the stoichiometry of ATP and GTP consumption during bacterial protein synthesis. The task is to derive a total energetic cost function based solely on these premises, which constitutes a valid and formalizable problem. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe total energetic cost, denoted as $E_{total}$, for the synthesis of a single polypeptide of length $n$ amino acids can be expressed as the sum of the costs of four distinct and sequential stages: amino acid activation (aminoacylation), translation initiation, polypeptide chain elongation, and translation termination.\n\n$$E_{total} = E_{acyl} + E_{init} + E_{elong} + E_{term}$$\n\nWe will now derive the energetic cost for each stage from the principles and stoichiometric values provided in the problem statement. The cost is measured in equivalents of high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds.\n\n1.  **Cost of Aminoacylation ($E_{acyl}$)**:\n    A polypeptide of length $n$ is a polymer of $n$ amino acids. Before incorporation into the polypeptide chain, each of these $n$ amino acids must be \"activated\" by being covalently attached to its corresponding transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule. This reaction is catalyzed by an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. The problem states that each such event, including the formation of the initiator methionyl-tRNA, consumes one molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is hydrolyzed to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate (PPi). The hydrolysis ATP $\\rightarrow$ AMP + PPi involves the cleavage of two high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds. Therefore, it is accounted as $2$ energy equivalents.\n    For a polypeptide of length $n$, there are $n$ such aminoacylation events. The total cost for this stage is:\n    $$E_{acyl} = n \\times (\\text{cost per aminoacylation})$$\n    $$E_{acyl} = n \\times 2$$\n    $$E_{acyl} = 2n$$\n\n2.  **Cost of Initiation ($E_{init}$)**:\n    The synthesis of each polypeptide chain begins with the assembly of the translation initiation complex on the messenger RNA (mRNA). According to the problem, this process consumes one molecule of guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which is hydrolyzed to guanosine diphosphate (GDP). The hydrolysis GTP $\\rightarrow$ GDP + Pi involves the cleavage of one high-energy phosphoanhydride bond, which is counted as $1$ energy equivalent. Initiation is a singular event for each polypeptide synthesized.\n    Thus, the cost of initiation is:\n    $$E_{init} = 1$$\n\n3.  **Cost of Elongation ($E_{elong}$)**:\n    Following initiation, the polypeptide chain is extended by the sequential addition of amino acids. The first amino acid is positioned in the ribosomal P-site during initiation. The remaining $n-1$ amino acids are added during $n-1$ successive cycles of elongation. The problem specifies that each elongation cycle consumes two molecules of GTP. One GTP is used by Elongation Factor Tu (EF-Tu) for the delivery of an aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosomal A-site, and a second GTP is used by Elongation Factor G (EF-G) to catalyze the translocation of the ribosome along the mRNA. Each GTP hydrolysis yields $1$ energy equivalent.\n    The total cost for the $n-1$ elongation cycles is:\n    $$E_{elong} = (n-1) \\times (\\text{cost per cycle})$$\n    $$E_{elong} = (n-1) \\times (1_{\\text{EF-Tu}} + 1_{\\text{EF-G}})$$\n    $$E_{elong} = (n-1) \\times 2$$\n    $$E_{elong} = 2n - 2$$\n\n4.  **Cost of Termination ($E_{term}$)**:\n    When the ribosome reaches a stop codon on the mRNA, the process of translation terminates, and the completed polypeptide is released. The problem states that termination and subsequent ribosome recycling together consume two additional molecules of GTP. These are attributed to RF3 and EF-G/RRF activities. This is a singular event marking the end of synthesis for one polypeptide. The hydrolysis of two GTP molecules corresponds to $2$ energy equivalents.\n    Therefore, a cost of termination is:\n    $$E_{term} = 2$$\n\nFinally, to find the total energetic cost, $E_{total}$, we sum the costs of all four stages:\n$$E_{total} = E_{acyl} + E_{init} + E_{elong} + E_{term}$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for each term:\n$$E_{total} = (2n) + (1) + (2n - 2) + (2)$$\nCombining the terms with $n$ and the constant terms:\n$$E_{total} = (2n + 2n) + (1 - 2 + 2)$$\n$$E_{total} = 4n + 1$$\n\nThis closed-form expression represents the total number of high-energy phosphoanhydride bond equivalents required to synthesize a polypeptide of length $n$ in a bacterium, based on the provided stoichiometry.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4n + 1}$$", "id": "2967275"}, {"introduction": "With the energetic cost established, we now turn to the informational challenge of translation: how does the cell decode $61$ different sense codons using a limited set of transfer RNA molecules?

No single anticodon base can pair with all four. A minimum of two tRNA species is required.\n    - One efficient strategy is:\n      - A tRNA with $I$ at the 5' anticodon position pairs with codons ending in $U$, $C$, or $A$.\n      - A second tRNA with $C$ at the 5' anticodon position pairs with the codon ending in $G$.\n    - An alternative strategy is:\n      - A tRNA with $G$ at the 5' anticodon position pairs with codons ending in $U$ or $C$.\n      - A second tRNA with $U$ at the 5' anticodon position pairs with codons ending in $A$ or $G$.\n    - Both strategies require a minimum of $2$ tRNA species per fourfold-degenerate box.\n    - Total tRNAs for the $8$ boxes: $8 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\n2.  **Twofold-degenerate codon pairs:** There are $12$ such pairs. These fall into two categories.\n    - Pairs of the form $XYU$ and $XYC$: A single tRNA with $G$ at the 5' anticodon position can recognize both codons, as $G$ pairs with $C$ or $U$.\n    - Pairs of the form $XYA$ and $XYG$: A single tRNA with $U$ at the 5' anticodon position can recognize both codons, as $U$ pairs with $A$ or $G$.\n    - In either case, one tRNA species is sufficient for each pair.\n    - Total tRNAs for the $12$ pairs: $12 \\times 1 = 12$.\n\n3.  **Threefold-degenerate set for Isoleucine:** The codons are $AUU, AUC, AUA$.\n    - A single tRNA with the anticodon starting with $I$ (e.g., $5'$-IAU-$3'$) can decode all three codons, since $I$ pairs with $U, C,$ and $A$. This anticodon does not read the methionine codon $AUG$, as $I$ does not pair with $G$ according to the specified rules. Thus, decoding is unambiguous.\n    - Total tRNAs for this set: $1$.\n\n4.  **Singleton codons:** There are $2$ such codons, for Methionine ($AUG$) and Tryptophan ($UGG$).\n    - **Methionine ($AUG$):** The codon for isoleucine, $AUA$, differs only at the third position. To avoid misreading $AUA$ as methionine, a specific tRNA is required. An anticodon starting with $U$ would read both $AUA$ and $AUG$. Therefore, an anticodon starting with $C$ must be used, which pairs only with $G$. One tRNA is required.\n    - **Tryptophan ($UGG$):** The codon $UGA$ is a stop codon. To specifically read $UGG$ without reading $UGA$, an anticodon starting with $C$ is necessary, as an anticodon starting with $U$ would pair with both $A$ and $G$.

This allows us to calculate the probability of a particular pathway by considering the branching ratios at each step.\n\nFirst, consider the initial discrimination stage starting from the pre-hydrolysis complex $C_{0,X}$.
