A solution will be provided.\n\nThe Eyring–Polanyi equation from transition state theory relates the rate constant $k$ of a reaction to the Gibbs free energy of activation, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$. The equation is:\n$$ k = \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{RT}\\right) $$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $h$ is the Planck constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $R$ is the universal gas constant.

The problem states that this pre-exponential factor is identical for both the wild-type (WT) and mutant (mut) ribosomes.\n\nLet $k_{\\text{chem}}^{\\text{WT}}$ and $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{WT}}$ be the rate constant and activation free energy for the wild-type ribosome, respectively. Let $k_{\\text{chem}}^{\\text{mut}}$ and $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{mut}}$ be the corresponding quantities for the mutant ribosome.\n\nWe can write the rate constants for the two systems as:\n$$ k_{\\text{chem}}^{\\text{WT}} = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{WT}}}{RT}\\right) $$\n$$ k_{\\text{chem}}^{\\text{mut}} = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{mut}}}{RT}\\right) $$\nwhere $A$ represents the constant pre-exponential factor.\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $\\frac{k_{\\text{chem}}^{\\text{mut}}}{k_{\\text{chem}}^{\\text{WT}}}$.

A stabilization corresponds to a *decrease* in free energy. Since the ground-state energies are unaffected, this stabilization directly lowers the activation barrier. Therefore, the activation free energy of the mutant is lower than that of the wild-type by this amount.\nLet the stabilization energy be $\\Delta G_{\\text{stab}}^{\\ddagger} = 2$ kcal mol$^{-1}$.

Since $\\Delta G_{\\text{mech}}$ scales linearly with the amplitude, the new mechanical contribution under inhibition (inhib) is:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{mech, inhib}} = 0.5 \\times \\Delta G_{\\text{mech, wt}} = 0.5 \\times (2\\,k_{\\text{B}}T) = 1\\,k_{\\text{B}}T\n$$\nThe new effective activation barrier is:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{inhib}} = \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{0} - \\Delta G_{\\text{mech, inhib}} = \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{0} - 1\\,k_{\\text{B}}T\n$$\nThe new translocation rate constant is:\n$$\nk_{\\text{trans, inhib}} = C \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{inhib}}}{k_{\\text{B}}T}\\right) = C \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{0} - 1\\,k_{\\text{B}}T}{k_{\\text{B}}T}\\right)\n$$\nTo find the effect on the rate, we calculate the ratio of the inhibited rate to the wild-type rate:\n$$\n\\frac{k_{\\text{trans, inhib}}}{k_{\\text{trans, wt}}} = \\frac{C \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{0} - k_{\\text{B}}T}{k_{\\text{B}}T}\\right)}{C \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{0} - 2\\,k_{\\text{B}}T}{k_{\\text{B}}T}\\right)} = \\exp\\left[ \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{0}}{k_{\\text{B}}T} + 1\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{0}}{k_{\\text{B}}T} + 2\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{k_{\\text{trans, inhib}}}{k_{\\text{trans, wt}}} = \\exp(1 - 2) = \\exp(-1) = e^{-1} \\approx \\frac{1}{2.718}\n$$\nThus, the translocation rate constant decreases by a factor of $e$, which is approximately a $2.7$-fold decrease.\n\n**Part 2: Effect on Translocation Fidelity**\nFidelity is the ability to discriminate against incorrect substrates. An increase in fidelity corresponds to a decrease in the error rate. The problem defines the probability of translocating an incorrect (near-cognate) complex, which is a measure of error, as being proportional to:\n$$\nP_{\\text{error}} \\propto \\frac{k_{\\text{trans}}}{k_{\\text{trans}} + k_{\\text{off}}}\n$$\nWe have established that under inhibition, $k_{\\text{trans}}$ decreases significantly: $k_{\\text{trans, inhib}} = e^{-1} \\cdot k_{\\text{trans, wt}}$. The problem states that $k_{\\text{off}}$ is insensitive to the perturbation.\n\nLet's examine the behavior of the error probability as a function of $k_{\\text{trans}}$. This is a competition between the forward translocation step (rate $k_{\\text{trans}}$) and the dissociation/reversal of the incorrect complex (rate $k_{\\text{off}}$).\nSince $k_{\\text{trans}}$ is decreasing and $k_{\\text{off}}$ remains constant, the denominator $(k_{\\text{trans}} + k_{\\text{off}})$ decreases, but less than proportionally to the numerator $k_{\\text{trans}}$. The fraction $\\frac{k_{\\text{trans}}}{k_{\\text{trans}} + k_{\\text{off}}}$ will decrease. For example, if $k_{\\text{trans, wt}} = k_{\\text{off}}$, then $P_{\\text{error, wt}} \\propto 1/2$. Under inhibition, $k_{\\text{trans, inhib}} \\approx 0.37 \\cdot k_{\\text{off}}$, and $P_{\\text{error, inhib}} \\propto \\frac{0.37}{0.37+1} \\approx 0.27$. This is a clear decrease in the error probability.\n\nA decrease in the error probability $P_{\\text{error}}$ signifies an **increase** in fidelity.\nThe mechanism is kinetic gating: slowing down the forward translocation rate ($k_{\\text{trans}}$) gives the incorrect complex more time to dissociate via the $k_{\\text{off}}$ pathway before it is irreversibly moved to the post-translocation state.\n\n**Conclusion:** The inhibition of head swivel causes the translocation rate to decrease by a factor of $e$ and causes the fidelity to increase.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The translocation rate constant decreases by approximately an $e$-fold (about $2.7$-fold slower), and fidelity increases, because raising the gating barrier by reducing head swivel prolongs the gated intermediate, allowing more near-cognate complexes to reverse before passage.**\n- **Rate:** \"decreases by approximately an $e$-fold\" - This is correct based on our derivation.\n- **Fidelity:** \"fidelity increases\" - This is correct based on our derivation.\n- **Reasoning:** \"raising the gating barrier... prolongs the gated intermediate\" (i.e., decreases $k_{\\text{trans}}$) and \"allowing more near-cognate complexes to reverse\" (i.e., the $k_{\\text{off}}$ pathway becomes more probable relative to the $k_{\\text{trans}}$ pathway). This reasoning accurately describes the kinetic gating mechanism outlined in the problem.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. The translocation rate constant increases by approximately $2$-fold and fidelity decreases, because reducing head swivel lessens steric hindrance, accelerating mRNA–tRNA passage through a less selective gate.**\n- **Rate:** \"increases by approximately $2$-fold\" - Incorrect. The rate decreases. The premise that head swivel *creates* hindrance is contrary to the problem statement, which implies it *facilitates* translocation by lowering the energy barrier.\n- **Fidelity:** \"fidelity decreases\" - Incorrect.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. The translocation rate constant decreases by approximately an $e$-fold, and fidelity decreases, because the longer dwell promotes frameshifting and slippage, overwhelming any gating advantage.**\n- **Rate:** \"decreases by approximately an $e$-fold\" - Correct.\n- **Fidelity:** \"fidelity decreases\" - Incorrect. The model provided leads to an increase in fidelity with respect to near-cognate discrimination. The reasoning introduces the concept of frameshifting, which, while a real phenomenon, is outside the scope of the fidelity definition provided in the problem statement ($k_{\\text{trans}} / (k_{\\text{trans}} + k_{\\text{off}})$ for near-cognate tRNA). We must adhere to the provided model.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. There is no significant change in the translocation rate, but fidelity increases, because EF-G compensates energetically to maintain throughput while enforcing stricter selection at the gate.**\n- **Rate:** \"no significant change\" - Incorrect. A decrease by a factor of $e \\approx 2.7$ is significant. The reasoning about EF-G compensation is speculative and contradicts the problem's framing, which isolates the effect of head swivel.\n- **Fidelity:** \"fidelity increases\" - Correct. However, both the rate prediction and its justification are flawed.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\nOnly option A is fully consistent with the derivation from the provided principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$"}]}
