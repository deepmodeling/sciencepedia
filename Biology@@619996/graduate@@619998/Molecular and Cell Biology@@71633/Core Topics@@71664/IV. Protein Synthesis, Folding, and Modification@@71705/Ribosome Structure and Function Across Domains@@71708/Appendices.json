The given rRNA sizes are standard approximations used in molecular biology. The existence of rRNA in ribosomes and the distinction between bacterial ($70\\text{S}$) and eukaryotic ($80\\text{S}$) ribosomes, including their different rRNA components, are fundamental concepts. The notion that eukaryotic rRNAs contain expansion segments (ES) accounting for their larger size is a well-established observation from comparative structural biology. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary numerical data and a simplifying assumption (constant mass per nucleotide) to permit a unique calculation. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the specified criteria for invalidity. It is a straightforward, formalizable estimation problem based on accepted scientific facts.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe core principle is that the mass of a polymer is directly proportional to its length if the constituent monomers have a constant average mass. Let $M_B$ be the total mass of rRNA in a bacterial ribosome and $M_E$ be the total mass of rRNA in a eukaryotic ribosome. Let $L_B$ and $L_E$ be the total lengths of these rRNA complements in nucleotides (nt), respectively. Let $m_{nt}$ be the average mass of a single nucleotide residue.\n\nAccording to the stated principle, the total mass is the product of the total length and the average mass per monomer:\n$$M_B = L_B \\cdot m_{nt}$$\n$$M_E = L_E \\cdot m_{nt}$$\n\nFirst, we must calculate the total length of rRNA in each type of ribosome by summing the lengths of their constituent parts.\n\nFor a bacterial ribosome:\n$$L_B = (\\text{length of } 16\\text{S}) + (\\text{length of } 23\\text{S}) + (\\text{length of } 5\\text{S})$$\n$$L_B = 1540 \\text{ nt} + 2900 \\text{ nt} + 120 \\text{ nt} = 4560 \\text{ nt}$$\n\nFor a eukaryotic ribosome:\n$$L_E = (\\text{length of } 18\\text{S}) + (\\text{length of } 28\\text{S}) + (\\text{length of } 5.8\\text{S}) + (\\text{length of } 5\\text{S})$$\n$$L_E = 1900 \\text{ nt} + 5000 \\text{ nt} + 160 \\text{ nt} + 120 \\text{ nt} = 7180 \\text{ nt}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the fractional increase in total rRNA mass from bacteria to eukaryotes. The fractional increase, denoted by $F$, is defined as the change in mass divided by the original mass:\n$$F = \\frac{M_E - M_B}{M_B}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for mass in terms of length:\n$$F = \\frac{(L_E \\cdot m_{nt}) - (L_B \\cdot m_{nt})}{L_B \\cdot m_{nt}}$$\n\nThe term for the average mass per nucleotide, $m_{nt}$, is a common factor in the numerator and denominator, and thus cancels out. This demonstrates that the final result is independent of the actual mass of a nucleotide, as long as it is assumed constant.\n$$F = \\frac{L_E - L_B}{L_B}$$\n\nNow,\nwe substitute the calculated total lengths into this expression:\n$$F = \\frac{7180 - 4560}{4560} = \\frac{2620}{4560}$$\n\nPerforming the division gives the numerical value:\n$$F \\approx 0.5745614035...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

Buffer, ionic strength, and temperature are constant.\n- **Fundamental Principles:**\n    1.  General Acid–Base Catalysis (GABC): Positioned proton donors/acceptors lower activation free energy ($\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$).\n    2.  Transition State Theory (TST): The rate constant $k$ is related to activation free energy by $k \\propto e^{-\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}/RT}$. Removing a catalytic group increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases $k$.\n- **Question:** Predict the effect of the $2'$-OH to $2'$-H substitution at P-site tRNA $A76$ on $k_{\\text{pep}}$ across the three domains of life and explain its mechanistic implications.\n\n**Step 2: Validation of the Problem Statement**\nThe problem describes a well-established experimental design (atomic mutagenesis coupled with rapid kinetics) used to probe enzymatic mechanisms. The system (ribosome PTC), the specific modification ($2'$-H substitution at $A76$), and the theoretical framework (GABC, TST) are all scientifically sound and central to the field of molecular biology, specifically ribosome function. The question is objective, well-posed, and free of contradictions or vagueness. It addresses a fundamental, non-trivial question regarding the catalytic mechanism of peptide bond formation. Thus, the problem statement is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Solution Derivation**\nThe reaction in question is the formation of a peptide bond, a nucleophilic acyl substitution. The $\\alpha$-amino group of the A-site aminoacyl-tRNA attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ester linkage in the P-site peptidyl-tRNA. This reaction proceeds through a high-energy tetrahedral intermediate.\n\nAccording to the provided principle of General Acid-Base Catalysis (GABC), the stabilization of charge development in the transition state is crucial for catalysis. The attacking $\\alpha$-amino group (pKa $\\approx 7-8$) must be deprotonated to be nucleophilic, while the oxyanion of the tetrahedral intermediate must be protonated to be stabilized. A concerted mechanism involving proton transfers is thus expected to significantly lower the activation free energy, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in identifying the group responsible for this GABC. High-resolution crystal structures of the ribosome show that the PTC active site is composed entirely of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), with no ribosomal protein side chains or metal ions positioned to act as a general acid or base. However, the $2'$-OH group of the P-site tRNA's terminal adenosine ($A76$) is positioned in immediate proximity to the reaction center, specifically near the attacking A-site amine.\n\nThis observation led to the \"substrate-assisted catalysis\" model, where the $2'$-OH of the P-site tRNA acts as a proton shuttle. In this model, the $2'$-OH facilitates the reaction by:\n1.  Acting as a base to accept a proton from the A-site $\\alpha$-amino group, increasing its nucleophilicity.\n2.  Subsequently acting as an acid to donate a proton to the oxyanion of the tetrahedral intermediate, stabilizing it.\nThis dual function as a proton acceptor and donor is a hallmark of GABC.\n\nThe experiment described directly tests this model. Substituting the catalytic $2'$-OH group with a non-functional $2'$-H group removes the proposed proton shuttle. Based on the provided principles:\n1.  **GABC:** Removal of the key catalytic group for proton transfer will prevent the efficient stabilization of the transition state.\n2.  **TST:** This will lead to a substantial increase in the activation free energy, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$. According to the relation $k \\propto e^{-\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}/RT}$, a large increase in $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ will cause a dramatic, exponential decrease in the rate constant, $k_{\\text{pep}}$.\n\nThe removal of a single, optimally positioned GABC group in an enzyme active site is known to decrease reaction rates by factors of $10^4-10^7$. Therefore, a rate decrease of approximately $10^6$-fold is a quantitatively reasonable prediction for the loss of a dominant catalytic function.\n\nThe PTC is one of the most highly conserved structures in all of biology. The identity of the active site nucleotides and the position of the terminal $A76$ of the P-site tRNA are universal. Therefore, if this substrate-assisted mechanism is the primary catalytic strategy, it should be conserved across bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. The experiment should yield a similar massive rate decrease in ribosomes from all three domains.\n\nThis finding implies that the ribosome's primary catalytic contribution to the chemical step is not through providing one of its own nucleotides for GABC, but rather through entropy reduction: precisely positioning the substrates (A-site and P-site tRNAs) relative to each other and providing an electrostatic environment that stabilizes the transition state. The chemical \"heavy lifting\" of proton transfer is outsourced to the substrate itself.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. $k_{\\text{pep}}$ decreases by approximately $10^6$-fold in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, indicating that the tRNA A$76$ $2'$-OH provides the dominant catalytic contribution via substrate-assisted GABC (proton shuttling), while the ribosome primarily achieves catalysis by precise positioning and transition-state stabilization rather than by acting as the general acid/base.**\nThis option aligns perfectly with our derivation. It correctly predicts a large, conserved rate decrease, identifies the mechanism as substrate-assisted GABC via a proton shuttle, and correctly interprets the respective roles of the substrate and the ribosome. This is consistent with extensive experimental data.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. $k_{\\text{pep}}$ decreases by at most $10$-fold, indicating that catalytic groups in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) serve as the principal general acid/base in the PTC and that the substrate $2'$-OH is largely dispensable; significant domain-specific differences are expected due to distinct protein contributions.**\nThis option predicts a minor rate decrease, implying the $2'$-OH is not important. This contradicts the proton shuttle model and experimental findings. If an rRNA nucleotide were the catalyst, the $2'$-H substitution would have a negligible effect, but the observed effect is massive. The claim of domain-specific differences is also unsubstantiated for this highly conserved active site.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. $k_{\\text{pep}}$ increases by approximately $10^3$-fold because removal of the $2'$-OH eliminates an inhibitory hydrogen bond, making the A-site amine more basic and accelerating nucleophilic attack; this implies the ribosome is the dominant chemical catalyst.**\nThis option predicts a rate *increase*, which is contrary to removing a catalytic group. Proposing the $2'$-OH is inhibitory is illogical in the context of GABC, where it is perfectly positioned to facilitate catalysis. Experimental results show a dramatic rate decrease, not an increase.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. $k_{\\text{pep}}$ decreases by approximately $10^6$-fold in bacteria but not in archaea or eukaryotes, implying that only bacterial ribosomes rely on substrate-assisted catalysis, whereas archaeal and eukaryotic peptidyl transfer employ protein side chains as general acids/bases in the PTC.**\nThis option correctly identifies the magnitude of the effect but incorrectly claims it is not conserved. The PTC is universally conserved, and so is the catalytic mechanism. There is no evidence for such a fundamental divergence in the mechanism of protein synthesis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. $k_{\\text{pep}}$ decreases by approximately $10^6$-fold primarily because the A$76$ $2'$-OH coordinates an essential $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ ion for metalloenzyme-like catalysis in the PTC; the magnitude should vary with intracellular $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ levels across domains.**\nWhile this option correctly predicts a large rate decrease, it proposes an incorrect mechanism. High-resolution structures show no metal ions directly participating in catalysis at the PTC. The proposed mechanism is GABC, not metal ion catalysis. Therefore, the role of the $2'$-OH is not to coordinate a catalytic metal ion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2963476"}, {"introduction": "Beyond speed, the paramount challenge for the ribosome is accuracy—selecting the correct aminoacyl-tRNA from a vast pool of competitors.

The question is structured to lead to a unique conclusion about kinetics, fidelity, and cellular phenotype.\n- **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and free of subjectivity. Terms like \"rigidifies,\" \"induced fit,\" and \"activation barriers\" have clear scientific meanings.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically valid, well-posed, and objective. A solution can be derived from the provided information.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the \"induced-fit\" mechanism of the ribosome. The small ribosomal subunit ($30\\text{S}$) must undergo a conformational change, from an \"open\" to a \"closed\" state, to verify the correctness of the codon-anticodon pairing in the A-site. This domain closure is a critical conformational checkpoint. The flexibility of ribosomal components, including helix h44, is essential for this transition.\n\n1.  **Effect of Rigidification on Conformational Change**: The problem states the mutation *rigidifies* h44. The transition from the open to the closed conformation of the $30\\text{S}$ subunit requires a specific set of movements of its domains. A more rigid h44 will resist this movement. Any process that involves this conformational change will therefore encounter a higher energetic penalty. The transition state for domain closure will be destabilized (its free energy increased).\n\n2.  **Impact on Activation Free Energy ($\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$)**: According to transition-state theory, the rate of a process is determined by the activation free energy barrier, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$. Because the rigidified h44 makes the required conformational change more difficult, the activation free energy, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, for achieving the closed conformation will *increase* for any substrate that must pass this checkpoint. This applies to both cognate (c) and near-cognate (nc) tRNAs. Therefore, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{c}}$ and $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{nc}}$ will both increase.\n\n3.  **Differential Impact and Fidelity**: The induced-fit model relies on kinetic partitioning. The activation barrier for accommodation, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, includes a large energetic cost for domain closure. This cost is partially offset by the stabilizing free energy from favorable interactions that the ribosome forms with a correctly paired codon-anticodon helix in the transition state. A near-cognate substrate, with its imperfect geometry, offers a much smaller stabilizing contribution. The h44-rigidifying mutation increases the intrinsic energetic cost of the domain closure conformational change. This adds a positive energy penalty to the activation barriers for both cognate ($\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{c}}$) and near-cognate ($\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{nc}}$) tRNA accommodation. This increased barrier slows down the acceptance pathway for both substrates, which competes with the rejection pathway (dissociation of the tRNA complex). By slowing accommodation, the mutation provides more time for dissociation to occur. This effect is more pronounced for the near-cognate tRNA, which has a weaker overall interaction and a higher intrinsic dissociation rate. Therefore, the rejection of near-cognate tRNAs is amplified more than that of cognate tRNAs. Consequently, the system becomes more discriminating. The rate of accepting a near-cognate tRNA ($k^{\\mathrm{acc}}_{\\mathrm{nc}}$) decreases more dramatically than the rate of accepting a cognate tRNA ($k^{\\mathrm{acc}}_{\\mathrm{c}}$). The ratio that defines error frequency, $k^{\\mathrm{acc}}_{\\mathrm{nc}} / k^{\\mathrm{acc}}_{\\mathrm{c}}$, must therefore *decrease*. This phenomenon is known as **hyperaccuracy**.\n\n4.  **Impact on Elongation Speed**: The rate of correct translation is determined by the cognate pathway. Since $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{c}}$ has increased, the rate of cognate tRNA accommodation, $k^{\\mathrm{acc}}_{\\mathrm{c}}$, will decrease according to $k \\propto \\exp(-\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}/RT)$. A slower rate of accommodation for correct tRNAs leads to a slower overall rate of protein synthesis (elongation).\n\n5.  **Cellular Phenotype**: The combination of increased accuracy (lower error frequency) and decreased speed is termed a **restrictive** phenotype. Such mutations often impair the overall fitness of the cell, leading to slow growth. Cold sensitivity is also a common associated phenotype, as lower temperatures further reduce molecular dynamics, exacerbating the effect of the pre-existing rigidity.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ increases for both cognate accommodation and near-cognate misreading, with a larger relative increase for near-cognate closure; the net effect is decreased $k^{\\mathrm{acc}}_{\\mathrm{nc}}/k^{\\mathrm{acc}}_{\\mathrm{c}}$ (hyperaccuracy), slower elongation, and a restrictive phenotype (reduced miscoding), often with slow growth and possible cold sensitivity.**\nThis option aligns perfectly with the derivation. Rigidification hinders the conformational change, increasing $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ for both pathways. The discrimination against near-cognate substrates is enhanced, decreasing the error ratio $k^{\\mathrm{acc}}_{\\mathrm{nc}}/k^{\\mathrm{acc}}_{\\mathrm{c}}$ (hyperaccuracy). The increased barrier for the cognate pathway inevitably slows elongation. The resulting phenotype is correctly identified as restrictive, with slow growth and potential cold sensitivity.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ decreases for both cognate and near-cognate pathways because rigidity favors a preorganized decoding center; the net effect is increased $k^{\\mathrm{acc}}_{\\mathrm{nc}}/k^{\\mathrm{acc}}_{\\mathrm{c}}$ (ambiguity), faster elongation, and a ribosomal ambiguity (ram) phenotype with elevated miscoding.**\nThis is incorrect. The problem is framed within the context of \"induced fit,\" which requires a conformational change. Rigidification hinders, not helps, this change. Therefore, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ must increase, not decrease. This option describes the opposite phenotype (ribosomal ambiguity, or ram), which would result from a mutation that *destabilizes* the open state or over-stabilizes the closed state, lowering the barrier to closure.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ increases for cognate accommodation but decreases for near-cognate misreading by bypassing induced-fit gating; the net effect is increased $k^{\\mathrm{acc}}_{\\mathrm{nc}}/k^{\\mathrm{acc}}_{\\mathrm{c}}$, slower elongation, and elevated miscoding.**\nThis is mechanistically incoherent. A single physical change—increased rigidity of h44—cannot simultaneously increase the energy barrier for one process (cognate accommodation) and decrease it for a very similar one (near-cognate accommodation) that relies on the same conformational transition. This contradicts the physical basis of the model.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. No significant change in $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ for decoding steps because catalysis occurs in the large subunit; the net effect is negligible on both fidelity and speed.**\nThis is incorrect. It misattributes the relevant function. While peptidyl transfer (catalysis of peptide bond formation) occurs in the large subunit ($50\\text{S}$), the process of decoding—codon recognition and tRNA selection—occurs in the decoding center of the small subunit ($30\\text{S}$). The mutation is in h44 of the $30\\text{S}$, at the very heart of the decoding machinery. Therefore, a significant effect on decoding kinetics is expected.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ increases only for cognate accommodation due to stricter geometric checking, leaving near-cognate misreading unchanged; the net effect is decreased fidelity and slower growth due to selective impairment of correct decoding.**\nThis is incorrect. The conformational change of domain closure is a prerequisite for the accommodation of *any* A-site tRNA. A physical impediment to this change, such as a rigidified helix, must increase the activation barrier for both cognate and near-cognate pathways. It is not logical that the near-cognate pathway would be unaffected. The conclusion of decreased fidelity is also contrary to the expected hyperaccuracy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2963453"}]}
