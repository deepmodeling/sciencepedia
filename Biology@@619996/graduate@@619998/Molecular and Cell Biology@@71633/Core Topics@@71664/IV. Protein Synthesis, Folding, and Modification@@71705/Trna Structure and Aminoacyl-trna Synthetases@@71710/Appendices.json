A rigorous solution will be developed.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows. First, we determine the standard Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$, from the dissociation constant, $K_{D}$. Then, we use the fundamental thermodynamic relation connecting Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy to find the entropic contribution, $T\\Delta S^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe binding process can be represented by the equilibrium:\n$$ \\mathrm{aaRS} + \\mathrm{tRNA} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{aaRS} \\cdot \\mathrm{tRNA} $$\nThe dissociation constant, $K_{D}$, is defined for the reverse reaction:\n$$ K_{D} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{aaRS}][\\mathrm{tRNA}]}{[\\mathrm{aaRS} \\cdot \\mathrm{tRNA}]} $$\nThe equilibrium constant for the association reaction, $K_{A}$, is the reciprocal of $K_{D}$:\n$$ K_{A} = \\frac{1}{K_{D}} $$\nThe standard Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$, is related to the equilibrium constant. A crucial detail is that the equilibrium constant used in the thermodynamic relation $\\Delta G^{\\circ} = -RT\\ln K_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ must be a dimensionless quantity, which is achieved by normalizing all concentrations to the standard state concentration, $C^{\\circ} = 1\\ \\mathrm{M}$.\n\nFor the association reaction above, the dimensionless equilibrium constant $K'_{A}$ is:\n$$ K'_{A} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{aaRS} \\cdot \\mathrm{tRNA}]/C^{\\circ}}{([\\mathrm{aaRS}]/C^{\\circ})([\\mathrm{tRNA}]/C^{\\circ})} = K_{A} \\frac{C^{\\circ}}{1} = \\frac{C^{\\circ}}{K_{D}} $$\nTherefore, the standard Gibbs free energy change is:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ} = -RT\\ln(K'_{A}) = -RT\\ln\\left(\\frac{C^{\\circ}}{K_{D}}\\right) = RT\\ln\\left(\\frac{K_{D}}{C^{\\circ}}\\right) $$\nWe are given the values:\n-   $K_{D} = 50\\ \\mathrm{nM} = 50 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{M} = 5 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{M}$\n-   $C^{\\circ} = 1\\ \\mathrm{M}$\n-   $R = 1.987 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$\n-   $T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n\nThe dimensionless ratio $\\frac{K_{D}}{C^{\\circ}}$ is $\\frac{5 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{M}}{1\\ \\mathrm{M}} = 5 \\times 10^{-8}$.\nNow, we calculate $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ} = (1.987 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}) \\times (298\\ \\mathrm{K}) \\times \\ln(5 \\times 10^{-8}) $$\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ} \\approx (0.592126\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}) \\times (-16.8112) $$\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ} \\approx -9.9544\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}} $$\nThe standard Gibbs free energy change is related to the standard enthalpy ($\\Delta H^{\\circ}$) and entropy ($\\Delta S^{\\circ}$) changes by the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ} = \\Delta H^{\\circ} - T\\Delta S^{\\circ} $$\nThe problem states that the measured binding enthalpy $\\Delta H = -15\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$ corresponds to the standard enthalpy change, so $\\Delta H^{\\circ} = -15\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$.\nWe can now solve for the entropic term, $T\\Delta S^{\\circ}$:\n$$ T\\Delta S^{\\circ} = \\Delta H^{\\circ} - \\Delta G^{\\circ} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ T\\Delta S^{\\circ} = (-15\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}) - (-9.9544\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}) $$\n$$ T\\Delta S^{\\circ} = -15 + 9.9544\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}} $$\n$$ T\\Delta S^{\\circ} = -5.0456\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}} $$\nThe problem requires rounding this value to three significant figures.\n$$ T\\Delta S^{\\circ} \\approx -5.05\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}} $$\nFinally, we must interpret the balance between enthalpic and entropic contributions.\n-   The enthalpic contribution to binding is $\\Delta H^{\\circ} = -15\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$. This is a large, highly favorable contribution, indicating the formation of strong, stabilizing non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and optimized van der Waals contacts upon complex formation.\n-   The entropic contribution is $T\\Delta S^{\\circ} = -5.05\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$. This is a moderately unfavorable contribution, meaning the overall entropy of the system decreases upon binding.\n-   The overall binding affinity, reflected by the negative $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ ($ -9.95\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$), is overwhelmingly driven by the favorable enthalpy change, which is strong enough to overcome the unfavorable entropy change. This is termed \"enthalpy-driven\" binding.\n\nThe unfavorable entropy change ($ \\Delta S^{\\circ} < 0 $) is physically expected. The primary sources of this entropic penalty are:\n1.  **Loss of Translational and Rotational Freedom**: Two independent molecules (aaRS and tRNA) combine to form a single complex, resulting in a significant loss of translational and rotational entropy.\n2.  **Loss of Conformational Entropy**: Both the protein and the tRNA are flexible macromolecules. To achieve the precise complementarity required for specific recognition, they must adopt more ordered, rigid conformations within the complex, reducing their conformational freedom.\n\nFor aaRS-tRNA specificity, this thermodynamic signature is highly informative. The high specificity of the synthetase for its cognate tRNA is achieved by a precise three-dimensional fit, which maximizes the number and strength of favorable enthalpic interactions (the source of the large negative $\\Delta H^{\\circ}$). This requirement for a highly ordered, well-defined interface is what imposes the entropic penalty ($T\\Delta S^{\\circ} < 0$). In essence, the system pays an entropic price to achieve the enthalpic gain that underpins molecular recognition and specificity. An interaction that is primarily driven by a large, favorable enthalpy change is often characteristic of high-specificity binding events where a precise, structured interface is formed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-5.05}$$", "id": "2846512"}, {"introduction": "Beyond initial binding, the crucial measure of an enzyme's fidelity is its ability to preferentially catalyze the correct reaction over incorrect ones, a concept central to the accuracy of protein synthesis.

The problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of enzyme kinetics and molecular biology, describing a plausible scenario of enzyme specificity. The language is objective and precise. The assumptions provided, particularly $ [S] \\ll K_M $ and $ K_M \\approx K_D $, are standard for simplifying kinetic analysis and render the problem well-posed. The data are dimensionally consistent. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles, is not incomplete, and contains no contradictions. A unique solution can be derived from the provided information. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be constructed.\n\nLet the cognate `tRNA` be denoted by $S_c$ and the near-cognate `tRNA` be denoted by $S_{nc}$. The enzymatic reactions are:\n$$ E + S_c \\xrightarrow{k_{on,c}} ES_c \\xrightarrow{k_{cat,c}} E + P_c $$\n$$ E + S_{nc} \\xrightarrow{k_{on,nc}} ES_{nc} \\xrightarrow{k_{cat,nc}} E + P_{nc} $$\nThe rate of an enzymatic reaction is given by the Michaelis-Menten equation. However, under the specified condition that substrate concentrations are much lower than the Michaelis constants ($ [S_c] \\ll K_{M,c} $ and $ [S_{nc}] \\ll K_{M,nc} $), the rate of formation for each product, $v_c$ and $v_{nc}$, simplifies. For a single substrate $S_i$, the rate $v_i$ is given by:\n$$ v_i = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat},i} [E]_{total} [S_i]}{K_{M,i} + [S_i]} $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ v_i \\approx \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat},i}}{K_{M,i}} [E]_{total} [S_i] $$\nThe term $\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_M}$ is the specificity constant, which we shall denote as $\\eta$. This approximation holds in a competitive scenario as well, provided that the total substrate concentration is low enough such that the free enzyme concentration $ [E] $ is approximately equal to the total enzyme concentration $ [E]_{total} $.\n\nThus, the rates of acylation are:\n$$ v_c \\approx \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat},c}}{K_{M,c}}\\right) [E]_{total} [S_c] = \\eta_c [E]_{total} [S_c] $$\n$$ v_{nc} \\approx \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat},nc}}{K_{M,nc}}\\right) [E]_{total} [S_{nc}] = \\eta_{nc} [E]_{total} [S_{nc}] $$\nThe misacylation probability, $P_{misc}$, is the fraction of total acylation events that correspond to the incorrect substrate, $S_{nc}$.\n$$ P_{misc} = \\frac{v_{nc}}{v_c + v_{nc}} $$\nSubstituting the rate expressions:\n$$ P_{misc} = \\frac{\\eta_{nc} [E]_{total} [S_{nc}]}{\\eta_c [E]_{total} [S_c] + \\eta_{nc} [E]_{total} [S_{nc}]} = \\frac{\\eta_{nc} [S_{nc}]}{\\eta_c [S_c] + \\eta_{nc} [S_{nc}]} $$\nIn any biological system requiring high fidelity, such as protein synthesis, the rate of the correct reaction must far exceed the rate of the incorrect one, meaning $ v_c \\gg v_{nc} $.
