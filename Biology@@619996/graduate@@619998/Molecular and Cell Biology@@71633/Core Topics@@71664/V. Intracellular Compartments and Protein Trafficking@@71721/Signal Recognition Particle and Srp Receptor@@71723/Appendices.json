This is not a matter of a simple code, but a biophysical interaction driven by the hydrophobic character of the signal's core region. This exercise provides a quantitative framework for understanding this \"hydrophobic handshake\" by asking you to calculate a \"hydropathy surplus,\" a measure of how much a given sequence exceeds the minimum hydrophobicity required for stable binding. By applying a well-established hydropathy scale, you will gain a tangible sense of the physical chemistry that governs this vital cellular decision point [@problem_id:2964586].", "problem": "A nascent polypeptide emerging from the ribosome presents an amino-terminal signal peptide composed of a positively charged n-region, a hydrophobic core (h-region), and a polar c-region. The Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) binds co-translationally to sufficiently hydrophobic h-regions via its methionine-rich M-domain, initiating targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane where the SRP receptor (SR) resides. A widely used and empirically grounded approach to quantify the hydrophobicity of the h-region is to compute the average of per-residue hydropathy values using the Kyte–Doolittle scale. Empirical recognition criteria for SRP binding can be formulated as a minimum average hydropathy threshold over a window corresponding to the h-region length, reflecting the minimal hydrophobic driving force needed for a favorable SRP–signal sequence interaction.\n\nConsider an h-region of length $L = 17$ residues whose Kyte–Doolittle average hydropathy is $H_{\\mathrm{avg}} = 2.0$. For SRP recognition, assume a conservative threshold average hydropathy $H_{\\mathrm{thr}} = 1.6$ for the h-region, justified by the need for a hydrophobic driving force sufficient to offset desolvation and to stabilize burial within the SRP M-domain binding groove, as inferred from empirical signal peptide datasets and the correlation between hydropathy scales and water-to-membrane transfer free energies.\n\nStarting from the definitions of an average and a sum over per-residue contributions, define the hydropathy surplus $S$ of the h-region as the total excess hydropathy of the sequence above the threshold across the window.

It describes a fundamental concept in molecular cell biology—the signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway—and frames a quantitative question based on established biophysical principles, specifically the use of hydropathy scales to model protein-membrane interactions. All necessary parameters are provided, and the definitions are clear enough to permit a formal, unique solution. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nWe begin by formalizing the definitions provided in the problem statement. Let the h-region of the signal peptide consist of $L$ amino acid residues. Let $h_i$ represent the Kyte–Doolittle hydropathy value for the $i$-th residue, where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $L$.\n\nThe average hydropathy of the h-region, $H_{\\mathrm{avg}}$, is defined as the arithmetic mean of the per-residue hydropathy values. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{avg}} = \\frac{1}{L} \\sum_{i=1}^{L} h_i$$\nFrom this definition, we can express the total hydropathy of the sequence, which we shall denote as $H_{\\mathrm{total}}$, by multiplying the average hydropathy by the length of the sequence:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} h_i = L \\cdot H_{\\mathrm{avg}}$$\nThe problem introduces a threshold average hydropathy, $H_{\\mathrm{thr}}$, which represents the minimum average value required for SRP recognition. We can conceptualize a hypothetical sequence of length $L$ where every residue contributes exactly this threshold hydropathy. The total hydropathy for such a threshold sequence, which we denote $H_{\\mathrm{total, thr}}$, would be:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{total, thr}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} H_{\\mathrm{thr}} = L \\cdot H_{\\mathrm{thr}}$$\nThe problem asks for the \"hydropathy surplus,\" $S$, defined as \"the total excess hydropathy of the sequence above the threshold across the window.\" This quantity is the difference between the actual total hydropathy of the sequence, $H_{\\mathrm{total}}$, and the total hydropathy of the conceptual threshold sequence, $H_{\\mathrm{total, thr}}$.\nTherefore, we define the surplus $S$ as:\n$$S = H_{\\mathrm{total}} - H_{\\mathrm{total, thr}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above for $H_{\\mathrm{total}}$ and $H_{\\mathrm{total, thr}}$:\n$$S = (L \\cdot H_{\\mathrm{avg}}) - (L \\cdot H_{\\mathrm{thr}})$$\nFactoring out the length $L$, we obtain the general expression for the hydropathy surplus in terms of the given parameters:\n$$S = L (H_{\\mathrm{avg}} - H_{\\mathrm{thr}})$$\nThis expression represents the net hydropathy of the segment relative to the minimum requirement for SRP binding, integrated over the length of the h-region.\n\nNow, we substitute the specified numerical values into this expression.

The Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) recognizes a signal sequence on a nascent polypeptide, binds to the ribosome, and transiently arrests or slows translation elongation. This slowdown is primarily attributed to the Alu domain of the SRP RNA. This allows time for the entire complex to be targeted to the SRP receptor (SR) on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The provided rates of translation ($1$ to $6$ aa/s) are within the physiologically accepted range for eukaryotic cells. The length of the nascent chain required for exposure ($40$ amino acids) is also consistent with the typical length needed to emerge from the ribosomal exit tunnel.

A solution will now be constructed.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between rate ($v$), extent of a process ($N$), and time ($t$) is given by the definition of rate:\n$$v = \\frac{N}{t}$$\nTherefore, the time required to complete the process is:\n$$t = \\frac{N}{v}$$\nWe are asked to find the *additional* time ($\\Delta t$) gained due to the elongation slowdown. This is the difference between the time it takes to polymerize $N$ amino acids at the slowed rate ($t_s$) and the time it would have taken to polymerize the same number of amino acids at the baseline rate ($t_0$).\n\nFirst, calculate the hypothetical time, $t_0$, to polymerize $N = 40$ amino acids at the baseline rate of $v_0 = 6$ amino acids/second.\n$$t_0 = \\frac{N}{v_0} = \\frac{40}{6} \\text{ seconds}$$\n$$t_0 = \\frac{20}{3} \\text{ seconds}$$\n\nNext, calculate the actual time, $t_s$, to polymerize $N = 40$ amino acids at the SRP-mediated slowed rate of $v_s = 1$ amino acid/second.\n$$t_s = \\frac{N}{v_s} = \\frac{40}{1} \\text{ seconds} = 40 \\text{ seconds}$$\n\nThe additional time, $\\Delta t$, is the difference between $t_s$ and $t_0$.\n$$\\Delta t = t_s - t_0$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\\Delta t = 40 - \\frac{20}{3}$$\nTo perform the subtraction, we find a common denominator:\n$$\\Delta t = \\frac{120}{3} - \\frac{20}{3} = \\frac{100}{3} \\text{ seconds}$$\nAs a decimal, this is approximately $33.333...$ seconds. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\Delta t \\approx 33.3 \\text{ seconds}$$\n\n**Biological Interpretation**:\nThe calculated additional time of approximately $33.3$ seconds represents a critical \"window of opportunity\" for the cell to ensure the fidelity of protein targeting. This delay, mediated by the Alu domain of SRP, is not a trivial pause. It serves to synchronize the process of protein synthesis (translation) with the process of protein membrane translocation. Without this elongation arrest, the ribosome would continue synthesizing the protein at a rapid rate. The polypeptide chain could become too long, fold into a stable conformation within the aqueous environment of the cytosol, or be completed and released from the ribosome before the entire SRP-ribosome-nascent chain complex has had sufficient time to diffuse and correctly dock with the SRP receptor on the ER membrane. Such an outcome would result in the mistargeting of secretory and membrane proteins, leading to their misfolding and aggregation in the cytosol, which is energetically costly and potentially cytotoxic.

If dissociation occurs first, the encounter is non-productive. Assume:\n- GTP hydrolysis in the encounter complex is a memoryless event with constant rate $k_{h}$, independent of cargo identity.\n- The encounter complex dissociates with a constant off-rate $k_{\\text{off}}$ that depends on the cargo identity: a correct signal sequence has off-rate $k_{\\text{off}}^{(\\text{corr})}$, while an incorrect signal sequence has off-rate $k_{\\text{off}}^{(\\text{incorr})}$.\n- Hydrolysis and dissociation are independent, competing Poisson processes.\n\nStart from the core principles of stochastic chemical kinetics for memoryless (Poisson) processes and derive the probability that an encounter results in commitment as a function of $k_{h}$ and $k_{\\text{off}}$.

It presents a standard problem in stochastic chemical kinetics applied to a well-known biological process. All necessary data and definitions are provided for a unique solution. We may proceed.\n\nThe problem describes a kinetic competition between two independent, memoryless processes: GTP hydrolysis with rate $k_h$ and complex dissociation with rate $k_{\\text{off}}$. Such processes are mathematically described as Poisson processes, meaning the waiting time for each event is exponentially distributed. Let $T_h$ be the time to hydrolysis and $T_{\\text{off}}$ be the time to dissociation. Their respective probability density functions are $p(t_h) = k_h \\exp(-k_h t_h)$ and $p(t_{\\text{off}}) = k_{\\text{off}} \\exp(-k_{\\text{off}} t_{\\text{off}})$.\n\nCommitment to targeting occurs if hydrolysis happens before dissociation, which corresponds to the condition $T_h < T_{\\text{off}}$. The probability of this event, $P_{\\text{commit}}$, must be derived. We can model this as a race between two competing first-order reactions. The total rate at which any event occurs (either hydrolysis or dissociation) is the sum of the individual rates, since the processes are independent:\n$$\nk_{\\text{total}} = k_h + k_{\\text{off}}\n$$\nThe probability that a specific event is the first to occur is the ratio of its rate to the total rate of all competing events. This is a fundamental property of competing Poisson processes. Therefore, the probability that hydrolysis occurs before dissociation is:\n$$\nP_{\\text{commit}} = \\frac{\\text{Rate of Hydrolysis}}{\\text{Total Rate of Events}} = \\frac{k_h}{k_h + k_{\\text{off}}}\n$$\nThis elegantly derived expression gives the probability of a productive encounter as a function of the hydrolysis and dissociation rates.\n\nThe problem defines the discrimination factor, $\\mathcal{D}$, as the ratio of commitment probabilities for a correct signal sequence versus an incorrect one.\n$$\n\\mathcal{D} \\equiv \\frac{P_{\\text{commit}}^{(\\text{corr})}}{P_{\\text{commit}}^{(\\text{incorr})}}\n$$\nUsing our derived formula for $P_{\\text{commit}}$, we can write the probabilities for the correct and incorrect cases.
