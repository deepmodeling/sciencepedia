According to the provided rule, any amino acid other than Lysine ($K$) or Arginine ($R$) is mapped to $X$. Alanine ($A$) at position $1$ is therefore mapped to $X$.

This score quantifies the logarithm of the ratio of the probability of observing the sequence $s$ under the cNLS model to the probability of observing it under the background model. It is expressed in natural logarithm units (nats).\nThe definition is:\n$$ S = \\ln\\left( \\frac{P(s | \\text{cNLS})}{P(s | \\text{Background})} \\right) $$\nGiven the assumption that positions contribute independently, the likelihood of the sequence under each model is the product of the probabilities of the amino acids at each position:\n$$ P(s | \\text{cNLS}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{7} p_i(s_i) $$\n$$ P(s | \\text{Background}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{7} q(s_i) $$\nwhere $p_i(a)$ are the position-specific probabilities from the Position Weight Matrix (PWM) and $q(a)$ are the position-independent background probabilities.\n\nThe log-odds score $S$ can thus be expressed as a sum of the log-ratios for each position in the sequence:\n$$ S = \\sum_{i=1}^{7} \\ln\\left( \\frac{p_i(s_i)}{q(s_i)} \\right) $$\nSubstituting the characters from our sequence $s = (X, K, K, K, R, K, K)$ and the given probability values:\n$$ S = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_1(X)}{q(X)}\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_2(K)}{q(K)}\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_3(K)}{q(K)}\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_4(K)}{q(K)}\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_5(R)}{q(R)}\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_6(K)}{q(K)}\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_7(K)}{q(K)}\\right) $$\nWe insert the numerical values from the problem statement:\n$$ S = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.70}{0.888}\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.25}{0.058}\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.55}{0.058}\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.60}{0.058}\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.40}{0.054}\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.30}{0.058}\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.20}{0.058}\\right) $$\nComputing each term:\n$$ S \\approx -0.23793 + 1.46098 + 2.24945 + 2.33644 + 2.00248 + 1.64332 + 1.23788 $$\nSumming these values gives the total log-odds score:\n$$ S \\approx 10.69262 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the log-odds score is $10.69$.\n\nThe second quantity to compute is the posterior probability that the given sequence is a functional cNLS.

It is a well-tested fact that the IBB domain of importin alpha is autoinhibitory: in the absence of importin beta, the IBB domain occupies the NLS-binding groove of importin alpha and reduces cargo binding. When importin beta binds to the IBB domain, this autoinhibition is relieved and the trimeric complex (cargo–importin alpha–importin beta) translocates through the NPC; in the nucleus, RanGTP triggers disassembly and cargo release with the help of nuclear factors.\n\nYou engineer an importin alpha mutant that lacks the IBB domain (the remainder of the ARM repeat cargo-binding groove is intact), and you express it in cells in which endogenous importin alpha is depleted.

Importin beta binding to the IBB domain relieves autoinhibition, allowing the formation of a `cargo–importin alpha–importin beta` trimer which translocates through the NPC. Disassembly is triggered by RanGTP in the nucleus.\n- **Experimental Condition:** An importin alpha mutant lacking the IBB domain (ΔIBB) is expressed. The ARM repeat cargo-binding groove is intact. Endogenous importin alpha is depleted.\n- **Assumptions:** All other components of the import/export machinery (importin beta, NPC, Ran cycle factors, NTF$2$, Nup$50$, CAS) are present and functional. The RanGTP gradient is unperturbed. The cargo is a fluorescent reporter with a canonical monopartite basic NLS. Non-classical import pathways are negligible.\n- **Question:** Predict the effect of the ΔIBB importin alpha mutant on: (i) cargo binding affinity in the cytoplasm, (ii) cytoplasmic sequestration of NLS cargo, and (iii) directional nuclear import of the cargo at steady state.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, describing the canonical nuclear import pathway with established molecular players and mechanisms, such as the autoinhibitory role of the IBB domain and the functions of importins and the Ran system. The experimental setup (domain deletion mutant, depletion of endogenous protein) is a standard approach in cell biology. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and assumptions to deduce a unique outcome. The language is objective and precise. There are no internal contradictions; the fact that importin beta binds to the IBB domain and that this domain is now deleted is the central premise from which consequences must be derived. The problem does not violate any physical laws and is not trivial.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A rigorous solution can be derived from the provided premises.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe effects of the IBB-lacking importin alpha mutant will be analyzed for each of the three specified parameters.\n\n**(i) Effect on cargo binding affinity in the cytoplasm:**\nThe problem states that for wild-type importin alpha, \"the IBB domain occupies the NLS-binding groove...and reduces cargo binding.\" This is an autoinhibitory mechanism where the IBB domain acts as a pseudo-substrate, competing with the NLS cargo for binding to the ARM repeat groove. In the engineered mutant, the IBB domain is absent. Consequently, the ARM repeat cargo-binding groove is constitutively accessible, with no intramolecular competitor. The removal of this autoinhibition eliminates the energetic penalty associated with displacing the IBB domain. Therefore, the binding affinity of the IBB-lacking importin alpha for the NLS cargo will be significantly higher than the basal, autoinhibited affinity of free wild-type importin alpha in the cytoplasm.\nPrediction for (i): Cargo binding affinity in the cytoplasm **increases**.\n\n**(ii) Effect on cytoplasmic sequestration of NLS cargo:**\nSequestration refers to the trapping of a molecule in a specific compartment. Based on (i), the ΔIBB importin alpha mutant binds strongly to the NLS cargo, forming a stable `(cargo–ΔIBB importin alpha)` complex in the cytoplasm. For this complex to be imported into the nucleus, it must recruit importin beta. The problem explicitly states that importin beta is recruited \"through its N-terminal Importin-Beta Binding (IBB) domain.\" As the mutant lacks this domain, it is incapable of binding to importin beta. The problem also states that \"translocation across the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) depends on importin beta interactions with phenylalanine-glycine repeat nucleoporins.\" Without importin beta, the `(cargo–ΔIBB importin alpha)` complex cannot interact with the NPC and thus cannot be translocated into the nucleus. This creates a dead-end complex that accumulates in the cytoplasm. By binding the cargo tightly and preventing its subsequent import, the ΔIBB mutant effectively sequesters the NLS cargo in the cytoplasm.\nPrediction for (ii): Cytoplasmic sequestration of NLS cargo **increases**.\n\n**(iii) Effect on directional nuclear import of the cargo at steady state:**\nDirectional nuclear import is a multi-step process. In the classical pathway described, the key steps are:\n1.  Formation of a `cargo–importin alpha` preliminary complex.\n2.  Recruitment of importin beta to form the `cargo–importin alpha–importin beta` trimeric import complex.\n3.  Translocation of the trimer through the NPC.\n4.  Disassembly of the trimer by RanGTP in the nucleus, releasing the cargo.\nThe ΔIBB mutant disrupts this process at step $2$. As established, the mutant cannot recruit importin beta because the IBB binding site is deleted. The absence of importin beta makes step $3$, translocation through the NPC, impossible. Since the problem specifies that non-classical import pathways are negligible, there is no alternative route for the cargo to enter the nucleus. Therefore, the entire import pathway is blocked. The net nuclear flux at steady state will be zero, or very close to it.\nPrediction for (iii): Directional nuclear import is **abolished or severely reduced**.\n\n**Integrated Prediction:**\n- Cargo binding in the cytoplasm **increases**.\n- Cytoplasmic sequestration of NLS cargo **increases**.\n- Directional nuclear import is **abolished or severely reduced**.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Cargo binding in the cytoplasm decreases; cytoplasmic sequestration decreases; directional import is partially maintained via importin beta alone.**\n- `Cargo binding...decreases`: Incorrect. Deleting the autoinhibitory domain increases binding affinity.\n- `Cytoplasmic sequestration decreases`: Incorrect. Trapping the cargo in a non-importable complex increases sequestration.\n- `Directional import is partially maintained via importin beta alone`: Incorrect. The cargo is described as having a canonical NLS that binds importin alpha, and the mutant traps it, preventing its interaction with any other import factor.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Cargo binding in the cytoplasm increases; cytoplasmic sequestration increases; directional import is abolished or severely reduced because importin beta cannot be recruited.**\n- `Cargo binding...increases`: Correct. The autoinhibitory IBB domain is absent.\n- `Cytoplasmic sequestration increases`: Correct. The cargo is trapped in the cytoplasm in a stable but import-incompetent complex with the mutant importin alpha.\n- `Directional import is abolished or severely reduced...`: Correct. The IBB domain is essential for recruiting importin beta, which in turn is essential for translocation through the NPC.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Cargo binding in the cytoplasm is unchanged; cytoplasmic sequestration is unchanged; directional import is unchanged because the RanGTP gradient is intact.**\n- `Cargo binding...is unchanged`: Incorrect. The biophysical properties of the importin alpha molecule have been fundamentally altered by deleting the IBB domain.\n- `Directional import is unchanged because the RanGTP gradient is intact`: Incorrect. The RanGTP gradient provides directionality but cannot compensate for a missing structural component required for translocation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Cargo binding in the cytoplasm increases; cytoplasmic sequestration decreases; directional import is enhanced because autoinhibition is relieved.**\n- `Cargo binding...increases`: Correct.\n- `Cytoplasmic sequestration decreases`: Incorrect. Sequestration increases.\n- `Directional import is enhanced...`: Incorrect. This logic is flawed. While an initial step (cargo binding) is enhanced, a subsequent, essential step (importin beta recruitment) is eliminated.

The following well-established facts constitute the fundamental base for reasoning: (i) directionality arises from a steep chemical potential difference for Ran bound to guanosine triphosphate (RanGTP), such that the nuclear concentration $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{N}$ greatly exceeds the cytoplasmic concentration $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{C}$, maintained by nuclear chromatin-bound Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor regulator of chromosome condensation $1$ (RCC1, which converts RanGDP to RanGTP in the nucleus) and cytosolic Ran GTPase activating protein (RanGAP, which stimulates RanGTP hydrolysis to RanGDP in the cytoplasm); (ii) in the cytoplasm, cargo with a classical NLS binds importin-α/importin-β when $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{C}$ is low; (iii) in the nucleus, RanGTP binding to importin-β dissociates the cargo from the receptor and allows receptor recycling; (iv) RanGDP returns to the nucleus via Nuclear Transport Factor $2$ (NTF2), where RCC1 regenerates RanGTP. The investigator perturbs the system in two ways: overexpression of nuclear RCC1 (denoted “+RCC1”) and small interfering RNA knockdown of cytosolic RanGAP (denoted “siRanGAP”).

It describes the canonical model of nuclear import mediated by the Ran GTPase system and proposes standard, well-defined molecular biology perturbations. The readouts are appropriate for querying the state of this system. Therefore, the problem is valid and a rigorous solution can be derived from the provided principles.\n\nThe directionality of nuclear import relies on the spatial segregation of the regulators of the Ran GTPase. Regulator of Chromosome Condensation $1$ (RCC1), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), is bound to chromatin in the nucleus and catalyzes the conversion of Ran bound to guanosine diphosphate (RanGDP) to Ran bound to guanosine triphosphate (RanGTP). Conversely, Ran GTPase Activating Protein (RanGAP) is predominantly cytosolic and stimulates the hydrolysis of RanGTP to RanGDP. This establishes a steep concentration gradient where $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{N} \\gg [\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{C}$. This gradient is the master regulator of the import/export cycle.\n\nThe process of classical nuclear import proceeds as follows:\n$1$. In the cytoplasm, where $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{C}$ is low, a cargo protein bearing a Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS) binds to the adaptor protein importin-$\\alpha$. This complex then binds to the transport receptor importin-$\\beta$.\n$2$. The entire ternary complex (cargo-importin-$\\alpha$-importin-$\\beta$) translocates through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) into the nucleus.\n$3$. In the nucleus, where $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{N}$ is high, RanGTP binds to importin-$\\beta$. This binding event induces a conformational change that causes the entire import complex to dissociate, releasing the cargo and importin-$\\alpha$ into the nucleoplasm.\n$4$. The importin-$\\beta$-RanGTP complex is then exported back to the cytoplasm. There, RanGAP stimulates GTP hydrolysis, converting RanGTP to RanGDP and releasing importin-$\\beta$, which is now ready for another cycle of import.\n\nWe will now analyze the two proposed perturbations based on these principles.\n\n**Perturbation 1: Overexpression of nuclear RCC1 (+RCC1)**\nRCC1 is the enzyme responsible for generating RanGTP in the nucleus. Overexpressing RCC1 will increase the rate of the reaction $\\mathrm{RanGDP} \\to \\mathrm{RanGTP}$ within the nucleus. This leads to a higher steady-state concentration of nuclear RanGTP, $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{N}$. While some of this excess RanGTP will be exported to the cytoplasm bound to transport receptors, the cytosolic RanGAP is highly active and will efficiently hydrolyze it, thus keeping the cytoplasmic concentration, $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{C}$, at a very low level. The net effect is a steepening of the RanGTP gradient across the nuclear envelope.\n\nThe overall rate of nuclear import is often limited by the rate of cargo release in the nucleus and the subsequent recycling of importin receptors. With an elevated $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{N}$, the binding of RanGTP to importin-$\\beta$ in the nucleus (Step $3$) becomes faster and more efficient. This accelerates cargo dissociation and regeneration of free importin-$\\beta$ (via its export and RanGTP hydrolysis in the cytoplasm). A faster recycling of importin receptors allows for a higher overall flux of cargo into the nucleus.\nTherefore, for the +RCC1 condition:\n- The RanGTP gradient, as measured by a ratiometric biosensor, will increase (higher nuclear signal relative to cytoplasmic signal).\n- The rate of import will increase. This corresponds to a decrease in the import half-time, $t_{1/2}$, measured by FRAP.\n- A higher import rate will lead to a greater accumulation of the NLS-GFP reporter in the nucleus at steady state, thus the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, $N/C$, will increase.\n\n**Perturbation 2: siRNA knockdown of cytosolic RanGAP (siRanGAP)**\nRanGAP is responsible for stimulating RanGTP hydrolysis in the cytoplasm. Reducing its concentration via siRNA knockdown will decrease the rate of this reaction. RanGTP, which is constantly exported from the nucleus (e.g., in complex with importin-$\\beta$), will accumulate in the cytoplasm because its primary removal mechanism is impaired. This leads to a significant increase in $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{C}$. As total Ran protein in the cell is finite, the accumulation of RanGTP in the cytoplasm depletes the pool of RanGDP available for re-import into the nucleus, which may also affect $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{N}$. The most dramatic and direct effect is the elevation of $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{C}$, which causes the collapse of the steep $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{N} \\gg [\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{C}$ gradient.\n\nThe functional consequence of high $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{C}$ is severe disruption of import. According to the established facts, the formation of the import complex (cargo-importin-$\\alpha$-importin-$\\beta$) in the cytoplasm (Step $1$) occurs only when $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{C}$ is low. High $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{C}$ competes with the importin-$\\alpha$/cargo complex for binding to importin-$\\beta$. Importin-$\\beta$ bound to RanGTP is in a conformation that cannot bind importin-$\\alpha$/cargo. Consequently, the first step of import is blocked.\nTherefore, for the siRanGAP condition:\n- The RanGTP gradient will collapse due to the increase in $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{C}$.\n- The rate of import will decrease substantially because import complex formation is inhibited. This corresponds to an increase in the import half-time, $t_{1/2}$.\n- A lower import rate will lead to a reduced accumulation of the NLS-GFP reporter in the nucleus, thus the $N/C$ ratio will decrease. The mechanistic reason is that importin-$\\beta$ is sequestered in the cytoplasm in a RanGTP-bound state, rendering it incapable of binding cargo for import.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. +RCC1: $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{N}$ increases while $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{C}$ remains low, $N/C$ increases and $t_{1/2}$ decreases; siRanGAP: $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{C}$ increases, the $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{N}$ versus $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{C}$ gradient collapses, $N/C$ decreases and $t_{1/2}$ increases, with importin-β accumulating at nuclear pores in a RanGTP-bound state that cannot bind cargo.**\nThis option perfectly matches the derived consequences for both perturbations. The description of the +RCC1 effects (steeper gradient, faster import) and the siRanGAP effects (collapsed gradient, inhibited import) and their underlying mechanisms are correct. The detail about importin-$\\beta$ being unable to bind cargo is the correct molecular explanation for the import block under siRanGAP.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. +RCC1: $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{N}$ decreases due to increased consumption by import, causing $N/C$ to decrease and $t_{1/2}$ to increase; siRanGAP: global RanGTP increases and drives both import complex formation and cargo release, so $N/C$ increases and $t_{1/2}$ decreases.**\nThe reasoning for +RCC1 is flawed; increased production by RCC1 is the primary effect, which increases, not decreases, $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{N}$. The reasoning for siRanGAP is fundamentally incorrect; high cytoplasmic RanGTP *inhibits* import complex formation, it does not drive it.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. +RCC1: elevated nuclear RCC1 increases $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{C}$ by mass action, preventing import complex formation and decreasing $N/C$ while increasing $t_{1/2}$; siRanGAP: reduced cytosolic hydrolysis lowers $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{C}$, facilitating import complex formation and increasing $N/C$ while decreasing $t_{1/2}$.**\nThe reasoning for +RCC1 is incorrect; it ignores the potent activity of cytosolic RanGAP, which maintains a low $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{C}$. The reasoning for siRanGAP is backward; reduced hydrolysis *increases*, not lowers, $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{C}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. +RCC1: no appreciable change in the RanGTP gradient or import kinetics because import is saturated, but the gradient partially collapses due to faster receptor recycling; siRanGAP: the RanGTP gradient steepens because Ran is retained in the nucleus, so $N/C$ increases and $t_{1/2}$ decreases.**\nThe claims for +RCC1 are speculative (saturation) and contradictory (faster recycling implies a change in kinetics and is driven by a steeper, not collapsed, gradient). The reasoning for siRanGAP is incorrect; siRanGAP causes RanGTP accumulation in the cytoplasm, collapsing the gradient, not steepening it.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. +RCC1 and siRanGAP both increase $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]_{N}$ and therefore both increase $N/C$ and decrease $t_{1/2}$, because more RanGTP always accelerates NLS import regardless of compartmental localization or receptor state.**\nThis statement is a dangerous oversimplification. The spatial localization of RanGTP is paramount. High nuclear RanGTP accelerates import, but high cytoplasmic RanGTP inhibits it. The claim that more RanGTP *always* accelerates import is fundamentally false and ignores the core principle of the Ran system's directionality.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThus, only option A provides a coherent and mechanistically correct account of the experimental outcomes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2958100"}]}
