Digitonin selectively perforates the cholesterol-rich plasma membrane while preserving the nuclear envelope and nuclear pore complexes, so endogenous cytosolic transport factors diffuse out but nuclear structures remain intact. You pre-load nuclei with a fluorescent Nuclear Export Signal (NES)-tagged cargo that diffuses in and accumulates in the nucleus at time $t=0$. You then wash away the cytosol and add back defined recombinant factors in transport buffer containing an energy regeneration system. You quantify export as a decay in nuclear fluorescence $F_{N}(t)$ and define an apparent first-order export rate constant $k_{\\text{export}}$ by the relationship $F_{N}(t)\\approx F_{N}(0)\\,e^{-k_{\\text{export}} t}$. Assume the following well-tested facts as the fundamental base for your reasoning: (i) the Ran small guanosine triphosphatase (Ran) exists in two nucleotide states, guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound and guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound; (ii) the Regulator of Chromosome Condensation 1 (RCC1) is a chromatin-bound guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Ran located in the nucleus, while the Ran GTPase-activating protein (RanGAP) and Ran Binding Protein 1 (RanBP1) are cytosolic; (iii) a high nuclear RanGTP to RanGDP ratio is normally maintained by nuclear RCC1 and cytosolic RanGAP/RanBP1; (iv) CRM1 forms a stable trimeric complex with NES cargo only when Ran is GTP-bound; (v) RanGDP returns to the nucleus in complex with Nuclear Transport Factor 2 (NTF2); (vi) export complexes disassemble in the cytoplasm upon RanGTP hydrolysis stimulated by RanGAP and RanBP1, releasing cargo and freeing CRM1 to recycle; (vii) Leptomycin B (LMB) covalently modifies cysteine 528 of CRM1 and blocks NES binding.

In digitonin-permeabilized cells, CRM1-dependent export of an NES cargo can be reconstituted such that $k_{\\text{export}} > 0$ by adding recombinant CRM1, RanGDP together with Nuclear Transport Factor 2 (NTF2), Ran Binding Protein 1 (RanBP1), RanGAP, an ATP/GTP-containing energy-regenerating system, and the NES cargo; the nuclear pool of RanGTP is generated by endogenous nuclear RCC1, and the observed export is abolished by Leptomycin B.\n\nB.

Endogenous cytosolic factors diffuse out, but nuclear structures (including chromatin-bound proteins) are retained.\n- **Experimental Procedure:** At time $t=0$, nuclei are pre-loaded with a fluorescent Nuclear Export Signal (NES)-tagged cargo. Cytosol is washed out. Defined recombinant factors are added in a transport buffer with an energy regeneration system (source of ATP and GTP).\n- **Measurement:** Nuclear fluorescence $F_{N}(t)$ is quantified.\n- **Export Rate Constant:** Defined by the first-order decay equation $F_{N}(t) \\approx F_{N}(0)\\,e^{-k_{\\text{export}} t}$.\n- **Established Facts:**\n    (i) Ran exists in two states: GTP-bound (RanGTP) and GDP-bound (RanGDP).\n    (ii) Regulator of Chromosome Condensation 1 (RCC1), the Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), is chromatin-bound and nuclear.

This releases the cargo and recycles CRM1.\n    (vii) Leptomycin B (LMB) covalently modifies cysteine 528 on CRM1, blocking its ability to bind NES cargo.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on the canonical, experimentally-verified model of nuclear export mediated by the RanGTPase cycle. The description of the digitonin permeabilization assay and the roles of all involved proteins (CRM1, Ran, RCC1, RanGAP, RanBP1, NTF2) and the inhibitor LMB are factually correct and represent standard knowledge in molecular and cell biology.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a complete and consistent set of facts and a clear experimental context. Based on this information, the correctness of each statement can be logically deduced. The question is unambiguous.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical and precise, devoid of subjective or interpretive claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-consistent. It presents a standard experimental scenario from cell biology that can be analyzed with the provided information. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. The solution will now proceed by analyzing each option.\n\n**Analysis of Options**\n\n**A. In digitonin-permeabilized cells, CRM1-dependent export of an NES cargo can be reconstituted such that $k_{\\text{export}} > 0$ by adding recombinant CRM1, RanGDP together with Nuclear Transport Factor 2 (NTF2), Ran Binding Protein 1 (RanBP1), RanGAP, an ATP/GTP-containing energy-regenerating system, and the NES cargo; the nuclear pool of RanGTP is generated by endogenous nuclear RCC1, and the observed export is abolished by Leptomycin B.**\nThis statement outlines a complete reconstitution of the nuclear export cycle.\n1.  RanGDP and NTF2 are added to the buffer. Following fact (v), NTF2 mediates the import of RanGDP into the nucleus through the intact NPCs.\n2.  Inside the nucleus, the endogenous, chromatin-bound RCC1 (fact ii), which is retained after permeabilization, catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ran. This generates a high concentration of RanGTP in the nucleus, as described in fact (iii).\n3.  In the presence of high nuclear RanGTP, the added CRM1 binds to the pre-loaded NES-cargo, forming the export complex (fact iv).\n4.  The complex translocates to the cytoplasm (the external buffer).\n5.  In the buffer, the added RanGAP and RanBP1 stimulate GTP hydrolysis on Ran (fact vi), causing the complex to disassemble and release the cargo.\n6.  This entire process constitutes a continuous cycle of export, leading to a decrease in nuclear fluorescence, hence $k_{\\text{export}} > 0$.\n7.  Leptomycin B (LMB) inhibits CRM1 by blocking NES binding (fact vii). Adding LMB would halt step 3, thus abolishing export.\nThe logic is sound and consistent with all provided facts.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Replacing wild-type Ran with a GTPase-deficient mutant RanQ69L preloaded with GTP increases $k_{\\text{export}}$ for CRM1-dependent export because it prevents premature cytoplasmic disassembly of the export complex.**\nRanQ69L is a mutant that cannot hydrolyze GTP, even when stimulated by RanGAP.\n1.  In the nucleus, RanQ69L-GTP will readily support the formation of the CRM1-RanQ69L-GTP-NES-cargo export complex.\n2.  This complex will be exported to the cytoplasm.\n3.  However, once in the cytoplasm, the complex cannot disassemble because RanQ69L is hydrolysis-resistant. This directly contradicts the requirement for disassembly outlined in fact (vi).\n4.  As a consequence, CRM1 is trapped in a stable, inactive complex in the cytoplasm. It cannot be recycled back into the nucleus for subsequent rounds of export.\n5.  Export will be stoichiometric, not catalytic. Each CRM1 molecule can mediate only one round of export. This will lead to a rapid halt of a sustained export process, resulting in a very low overall export rate, effectively driving $k_{\\text{export}}$ towards 0, not increasing it.\nThe statement's conclusion that $k_{\\text{export}}$ increases is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Substituting the GDP-preferring dominant-negative RanT24N for wild-type Ran blocks CRM1-dependent export (driving $k_{\\text{export}}\\rightarrow 0$) by sequestering the nuclear guanine nucleotide exchange factor and preventing re-formation of a high nuclear RanGTP pool.**\nRanT24N is a mutant that has a high affinity for the RanGEF, RCC1, but is a poor substrate for nucleotide exchange. It acts as a competitive inhibitor of RCC1.\n1. When RanT24N is added, it enters the nucleus and binds tightly to the endogenous RCC1.\n2. This sequestration of RCC1 prevents it from converting any available RanGDP into RanGTP.\n3. As a result, a high nuclear concentration of RanGTP cannot be established.\n4. According to fact (iv), CRM1 requires RanGTP to bind its NES-cargo. Without a nuclear pool of RanGTP, no export complexes can form.\n5. Therefore, nuclear export is blocked, and $k_{\\text{export}}$ will approach 0.\nThe reasoning provided in the statement is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Because digitonin permeabilization disrupts the nuclear envelope, the RanGTP gradient cannot be reconstituted; therefore, CRM1-dependent export in this assay can only be observed if the NES cargo is provided in the cytoplasm to bind CRM1 at the cytoplasmic face of nuclear pore complexes.**\nThis statement contains multiple falsehoods.\n1.  The initial premise, \"digitonin permeabilization disrupts the nuclear envelope,\" is explicitly contradicted by the problem description, which states that digitonin \"preserv[es] the nuclear envelope\". The nuclear envelope is cholesterol-poor and thus resistant to digitonin.\n2.  Consequently, the conclusion that \"the RanGTP gradient cannot be reconstituted\" is also false. The intact nuclear envelope is what allows for the spatial segregation of nuclear RCC1 and cytoplasmic RanGAP, which is the basis of the RanGTP gradient (fact iii).\n3.  Furthermore, CRM1-mediated export requires binding to NES-cargo *inside* the nucleus where RanGTP concentration is high (fact iv), not on the cytoplasmic face where RanGTP is hydrolyzed to RanGDP.\nThe entire premise and conclusion of this statement are flawed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. In this reconstituted system, the primary role of RanBP1 and RanGAP is to catalyze loading of GTP onto Ran inside the nucleus, thereby enabling CRM1 to capture cargo.**\nThis statement mischaracterizes both the function and location of these proteins.\n1.  **Function:** RanGAP is a GTPase-Activating Protein, meaning it stimulates the *hydrolysis* of GTP to GDP. The loading of GTP onto Ran is catalyzed by a Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF), which is RCC1 (fact ii).\n2.  **Location:** RanGAP and RanBP1 are cytosolic proteins (fact ii). In the described assay, they are added to the external buffer, which serves as the cytoplasm. They do not act inside the nucleus.\nTheir actual role is to disassemble the export complex in the cytoplasm (fact vi), which is the opposite of enabling cargo capture.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. In digitonin-permeabilized cells, chromatin-bound RCC1 remains within nuclei and catalyzes RanGDP to RanGTP in the nucleus, so exogenous RCC1 is not required to re-establish a nuclear RanGTP pool when RanGDP and NTF2 are supplied.**\nThis statement dissects a key advantage of the digitonin-permeabilization assay.\n1.  Fact (ii) states that RCC1 is a chromatin-bound protein.\n2.  The problem setup specifies that nuclear structures, which include chromatin, are retained in the digitonin-permeabilized cells. Therefore, endogenous RCC1 remains inside the nucleus.\n3.  As established in the analysis of option A, if RanGDP is supplied (and imported via NTF2), this retained, endogenous RCC1 is sufficient to catalyze the formation of RanGTP, establishing the necessary nuclear RanGTP pool for export.\n4.  Therefore, it is not necessary to add exogenous RCC1 to the reconstitution mixture.\nThe statement is a logical and factually correct description of the system.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACF}$$", "id": "2957961"}, {"introduction": "At the heart of the export process lies the specific molecular recognition between the exportin CRM1 and the Nuclear Export Signal (NES) on its cargo.

The fold-increase for a single hotspot substitution is $\\approx 41.0$. Since $7.59  41.0$, the double non-hotspot mutation is indeed less damaging to binding affinity than a single hotspot mutation. Both components of the statement hold.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Any single $\\mathrm{L} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{A}$ substitution has approximately the same effect on $K_d$ because NES recognition by CRM1 depends primarily on the number of leucines rather than their positions.**\nThis statement contradicts the fundamental premise of the model, which is the existence of \"hotspot\" pockets that contribute disproportionately to binding. Our calculations show a $\\approx 3$-fold increase in $K_d$ for a non-hotspot mutation versus a $\\approx 41$-fold increase for a hotspot mutation.

The condition for steady state is that the time derivative of the concentration is zero:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} \\bigg|_{t \\to \\infty} = 0 $$\nApplying this condition to our rate equation gives:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{in}} C^{*} - k_{\\mathrm{out}} N^{*} = 0 $$\nThis equation signifies that at steady state, the total flux of cargo into the nucleus is equal to the total flux out of the nucleus. We can rearrange this expression to solve for the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, $\\frac{N^{*}}{C^{*}}$, which is the quantity requested.\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{out}} N^{*} = k_{\\mathrm{in}} C^{*} $$\n$$ \\frac{N^{*}}{C^{*}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{in}}}{k_{\\mathrm{out}}} $$\nThe problem provides the specific context of a cell expressing the hydrolysis-defective RanQ69L mutant. In this case, the effective export rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{out}}$ is defined as:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{out}} = P_{\\mathrm{hyd}} k_{e} $$\nHere, $P_{\\mathrm{hyd}}$ is the probability of RanGTP hydrolysis and cargo release upon an encounter with RanGAP in the cytoplasm, and $k_{e}$ is the first-order rate constant for the exit of the export complex from the nucleus.\n\nThe given numerical values are:\n-   $k_{\\mathrm{in}} = 0.020 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n-   $k_{e} = 0.200 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n-   $P_{\\mathrm{hyd}} = 0.020$\n\nFirst, we must calculate the value of $k_{\\mathrm{out}}$ using the provided parameters for the mutant.\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{out}} = (0.020) \\cdot (0.200 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = 0.0040 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nNext, we substitute the values of $k_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{out}}$ into the expression for the steady-state concentration ratio.\n$$ \\frac{N^{*}}{C^{*}} = \\frac{0.020 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.0040 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} $$\nThe units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ cancel, yielding a dimensionless ratio, as expected.\n$$ \\frac{N^{*}}{C^{*}} = 5 $$\nThe problem requires that the final answer be expressed as a dimensionless number rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is the integer $5$. To represent this with three significant figures, we write it as $5.00$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{5.00}\n$$", "id": "2957963"}]}
