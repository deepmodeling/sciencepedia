Translocation via the TIM23 complex requires the inner membrane potential.\n    4. Alkaline carbonate extraction at high $pH$ strips peripheral proteins from membranes, whereas integral membrane proteins pellet with the membrane fraction.\n\n**Step 2: Validation of Problem Statement**\nThe problem is scientifically and logically sound. It describes a set of classical, well-defined experiments used in molecular cell biology to determine the import pathway, subcellular localization, membrane topology, and nature of membrane association for a mitochondrial protein. The provided reagents (valinomycin, antimycin A), techniques (protease protection assays with intact mitochondria and mitoplasts, alkaline carbonate extraction), and observations are all standard and consistent with established principles of mitochondrial biology. The data are internally consistent and provide sufficient, non-contradictory information to deduce a unique interpretation. The problem is well-posed, objective, and scientifically grounded.\n\n**Verdict: The problem is valid.**\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe comprehensive interpretation of the protein $pX$ requires a systematic synthesis of all three experimental observations.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Observation 1 (Energy Dependence and Processing):**\n    - The precursor protein $pX$ has a mass of $55\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$. Upon incubation with energized mitochondria, a smaller species of $42\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ appears. This mass decrease of $13\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ ($55-42=13$) is consistent with the cleavage of an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting presequence by the matrix processing peptidase (MPP), as stated in the assumed principles.\n    - Import and processing occur only under energized conditions, where the inner membrane potential ($\\Delta\\psi$) is maintained. Import is abolished under de-energized conditions. This energy requirement, specifically the dependence on $\\Delta\\psi$, is a hallmark of protein import through the Translocase of the Inner Membrane 23 (TIM23) complex.\n    - Under de-energized conditions, the $55\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ precursor remains sensitive to external protease, confirming it has not crossed the outer mitochondrial membrane and is exposed on the mitochondrial surface.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Observation 2 (Sub-mitochondrial Localization and Topology):**\n    - **Intact Mitochondria:** The mature $42\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ protein is resistant to external trypsin. This confirms that it has been successfully imported across the outer membrane and is located in a protease-inaccessible compartment: the intermembrane space (IMS), the inner membrane (IM), or the matrix.\n    - **Mitoplasts:** The outer membrane is ruptured, exposing the IMS and the outer face of the inner membrane to trypsin. In this state, the $42\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ protein is digested to a smaller, protected fragment of $35\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$. This is a critical finding. It demonstrates that the protein is not a soluble matrix or IMS protein. A soluble matrix protein would remain fully protected ($42\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$), and a soluble IMS protein would be fully digested. The result indicates that a portion of the protein ($42 - 35 = 7\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$) is exposed in the IMS, while the larger portion ($35\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$) is protected from digestion because it is located across the intact inner membrane, i.e., in the mitochondrial matrix. Therefore, the protein must be a transmembrane protein spanning the inner membrane.\n    - **Topology:** The protected $35\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ fragment is recognized by an antibody specific to the N-terminus. This proves that the N-terminus of the mature protein is located within the matrix. Consequently, the C-terminal portion must be the part that is exposed in the IMS and digested by trypsin. This establishes the topology as N-terminus(matrix) - C-terminus(IMS).\n    - **Detergent Control:** Digestion of all fragments in the presence of detergent confirms that the observed protection is indeed conferred by the integrity of the inner membrane barrier.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Observation 3 (Nature of Membrane Association):**\n    - The mature protein pellets upon alkaline carbonate extraction and ultracentrifugation. This behavior is identical to the known integral inner membrane transporter control and opposite to the soluble matrix protein control, which remains in the supernatant.\n    - According to the provided principles, this result unequivocally demonstrates that the mature protein is an **integral membrane protein**, deeply embedded in the lipid bilayer, and not a peripheral membrane protein that is merely associated with the membrane surface.\n\n**Synthesis and Conclusion:**\nCombining all evidence: $pX$ is a precursor protein targeted to the mitochondrion via an N-terminal presequence. It is imported through the TOM/TIM23 pathway in a $\\Delta\\psi$-dependent manner. In the matrix, its presequence is cleaved. Translocation across the inner membrane is then arrested by a stop-transfer sequence, causing the protein to be laterally integrated into the inner membrane. The final product is a $42\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ integral, single-pass inner membrane protein with its N-terminus in the matrix and its C-terminus in the intermembrane space. This entire process is a classic example of a stop-transfer mechanism at the TIM23 complex.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. pX is a single-pass inner membrane protein that uses a stop-transfer mechanism via Translocase of the Outer Membrane (TOM)/TIM23; its N-terminus resides in the matrix and its C-terminus in the intermembrane space, and it is an integral membrane protein.**\n- This statement is fully consistent with every piece of data. It correctly identifies the protein type (integral inner membrane), the import pathway (TOM/TIM23, implied by $\\Delta\\psi$ dependence), the resulting topology (N-matrix, C-IMS), and the underlying mechanism (stop-transfer).\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. pX is a soluble matrix protein that completely translocates into the matrix; the protected fragment after mitoplast protease treatment reflects incomplete digestion due to steric hindrance.**\n- This is incorrect. A soluble matrix protein would remain in the supernatant during alkaline carbonate extraction (contradicts Observation 3) and would be completely protected from trypsin in mitoplasts (contradicts Observation 2). The \"steric hindrance\" argument is a weak and unsubstantiated claim against the clear evidence of partial digestion.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. pX is a peripherally associated intermembrane space protein bound to the inner membrane; its association is maintained at physiological pH but disrupted by alkaline carbonate.**\n- This is incorrect. A peripherally associated protein would be stripped from the membrane by alkaline carbonate and found in the supernatant, not the pellet (contradicts Observation 3). Furthermore, a protein located entirely in the IMS would be completely digested upon mitoplast formation and trypsin treatment (contradicts Observation 2).\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. pX is an outer membrane Î²-barrel protein assembled via the Sorting and Assembly Machinery (SAM); the observed protease protection in intact mitochondria indicates insertion into the outer membrane.**\n- This is incorrect. Import of $\\beta$-barrel proteins via the SAM complex is not dependent on the inner membrane potential, $\\Delta\\psi$ (contradicts Observation 1). The protein is also shown to span the inner membrane, not the outer membrane (contradicts Observation 2).\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. pX is a single-pass inner membrane protein with its N-terminus in the intermembrane space and its C-terminus in the matrix, inserted via a post-import pathway independent of membrane potential.**\n- This is incorrect. It states the wrong topology; the antibody data clearly place the N-terminus in the matrix (contradicts Observation 2). It also incorrectly claims the import is independent of membrane potential (contradicts Observation 1).\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2960675"}, {"introduction": "Beyond qualitative models, a deeper understanding of protein import requires quantitative analysis of its kinetics.

We will proceed by evaluating each mutation against the two specified design criteria.\n\nThe analysis is based on the following governing principles and equations provided in the problem statement.\nThe temperature is $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$, and the gas constant is $R = 1.987 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$, which gives $RT \\approx 0.592\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n\n**Criterion 1: Import Acceleration**\nThe import rate is proportional to the unfolding rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{unf}}$, which is given by the Eyring-like equation:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{unf}} = k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{unf}}}{RT}\\right)$$\nThe unfolding activation energy, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{unf}}$, is related to the protein's thermodynamic stability, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$, by a linear free-energy relationship:\n$$\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{unf}} = a - b\\,\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$$\nwhere $a = 9.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$ and $b = 0.333$.\nA mutation changes the folding free energy by $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$. The corresponding change in the unfolding activation energy is:\n$$\\Delta\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{unf}} = \\Delta G^{\\ddagger, \\mathrm{mut}}_{\\mathrm{unf}} - \\Delta G^{\\ddagger, \\mathrm{WT}}_{\\mathrm{unf}} = -b(\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}) = -b\\,\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$$\nThe import acceleration factor is the ratio of the mutant's unfolding rate constant to the wild-type's:\n$$\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{unf}}^{\\mathrm{mut}}}{k_{\\mathrm{unf}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\Delta G^{\\ddagger, \\mathrm{mut}}_{\\mathrm{unf}}/RT\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\Delta G^{\\ddagger, \\mathrm{WT}}_{\\mathrm{unf}}/RT\\right)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{unf}}}{RT}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{b\\,\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}}{RT}\\right)$$\nThe criterion requires at least a $3$-fold acceleration, so we must have:\n$$\\exp\\left(\\frac{b\\,\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}}{RT}\\right) \\ge 3$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\exp\\left(\\frac{0.333 \\times \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}}{0.592\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}}\\right) \\ge 3$$\n$$\\exp(0.5625 \\times \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}/\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}) \\ge 3$$\nTo satisfy this, the destabilization energy $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$ must be:\n$$\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}} \\ge \\frac{\\ln(3)}{0.5625} \\approx \\frac{1.0986}{0.5625} \\approx 1.953\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$$\n\n**Criterion 2: Post-Import Catalytic Efficiency**\nThe catalytic efficiency is defined as $\\text{Efficiency} = (k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_M) \\times f_{\\mathrm{D,sub}}$, where $f_{\\mathrm{D,sub}}$ is the fraction of protein subunits in the active dimeric state. The criterion requires retention of at least $80\\%$ of the wild-type efficiency:\n$$\\frac{\\text{Efficiency}^{\\mathrm{mut}}}{\\text{Efficiency}^{\\mathrm{WT}}} = \\frac{(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{\\mathrm{mut}}/K_M^{\\mathrm{mut}})}{(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}/K_M^{\\mathrm{WT}})} \\times \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{D,sub}}^{\\mathrm{mut}}}{f_{\\mathrm{D,sub}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}} \\ge 0.80$$\nThe fraction of subunits in dimers, $f_{\\mathrm{D,sub}} = 2[\\mathrm{D}]/C_T$, is found by solving the dimerization equilibrium $2\\mathrm{M} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{D}$ for a total subunit concentration $C_T = [\\mathrm{M}] + 2[\\mathrm{D}]$ and dissociation constant $K_d = [\\mathrm{M}]^2/[\\mathrm{D}]$. The solution to the resulting quadratic equation for the dimer concentration $[\\mathrm{D}]$ gives:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{D,sub}} = \\frac{(4C_T + K_d) - \\sqrt{8C_T K_d + K_d^2}}{4C_T}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the baseline value for the wild-type protein.\nGiven $C_T = 5.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{M}$ and $K_d^{\\mathrm{WT}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\n$$f_{\\mathrm{D,sub}}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = \\frac{(4(5.0 \\times 10^{-6}) + 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}) - \\sqrt{8(5.0 \\times 10^{-6})(1.0 \\times 10^{-8}) + (1.0 \\times 10^{-8})^2}}{4(5.0 \\times 10^{-6})}$$\n$$f_{\\mathrm{D,sub}}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = \\frac{(2.0 \\times 10^{-5} + 0.01 \\times 10^{-6}) - \\sqrt{4.0 \\times 10^{-13} + 1.0 \\times 10^{-16}}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-5}}$$\n$$f_{\\mathrm{D,sub}}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = \\frac{2.001 \\times 10^{-5} - \\sqrt{4.0001 \\times 10^{-13}}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-5}} = \\frac{2.001 \\times 10^{-5} - 6.325 \\times 10^{-7}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx \\frac{1.9378 \\times 10^{-5}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 0.9689$$\nSo, the wild-type protein is approximately $96.9\\%$ dimeric. Now we evaluate each option.\n\n**Option A: H3$\\rightarrow$H3P**\n1.  **Import Acceleration**: $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}} = +3.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$. Since $3.0 > 1.953$, **Criterion 1 is met**.\n    The acceleration factor is $\\exp(0.5625 \\times 3.0) = \\exp(1.6875) \\approx 5.41$. The import is accelerated over $5$-fold.\n2.  **Catalytic Efficiency**: $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{\\mathrm{A}} = 0.9 \\times k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$, $K_M^{\\mathrm{A}} = K_M^{\\mathrm{WT}}$, and $K_d^{\\mathrm{A}} = K_d^{\\mathrm{WT}}$.\n    The ratio of enzymatic efficiencies is $(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{\\mathrm{A}}/K_M^{\\mathrm{A}}) / (k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}/K_M^{\\mathrm{WT}}) = 0.9$.\n    Since $K_d$ is unchanged, $f_{\\mathrm{D,sub}}^{\\mathrm{A}} = f_{\\mathrm{D,sub}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$.\n    The overall efficiency retention is $0.9 \\times 1.0 = 0.9$. Since $0.9 \\ge 0.8$, **Criterion 2 is met**.\n**Verdict for A**: **Correct**. This option satisfies both design criteria.\n\n**Option B: L$\\rightarrow$A x2 at dimer interface**\n1.  **Import Acceleration**: $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}} = +1.5\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$. Since $1.5 < 1.953$, **Criterion 1 is not met**.\n    The acceleration factor is $\\exp(0.5625 \\times 1.5) = \\exp(0.84375) \\approx 2.32$. This is less than the required $3$-fold acceleration.\n2.  **Catalytic Efficiency**: $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ and $K_M$ are unchanged, but $K_d^{\\mathrm{B}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{M}$. We must calculate the new dimer fraction $f_{\\mathrm{D,sub}}^{\\mathrm{B}}$.\n    $$f_{\\mathrm{D,sub}}^{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{(4(5.0 \\times 10^{-6}) + 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}) - \\sqrt{8(5.0 \\times 10^{-6})(1.0 \\times 10^{-6}) + (1.0 \\times 10^{-6})^2}}{4(5.0 \\times 10^{-6})}$$\n    $$f_{\\mathrm{D,sub}}^{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{2.1 \\times 10^{-5} - \\sqrt{4.0 \\times 10^{-11} + 1.0 \\times 10^{-12}}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-5}} = \\frac{2.1 \\times 10^{-5} - \\sqrt{4.1 \\times 10^{-11}}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-5}}$$\n    $$f_{\\mathrm{D,sub}}^{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{2.1 \\times 10^{-5} - 6.403 \\times 10^{-6}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx \\frac{1.4597 \\times 10^{-5}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 0.7299$$\n    The overall efficiency retention is $1.0 \\times (f_{\\mathrm{D,sub}}^{\\mathrm{B}}/f_{\\mathrm{D,sub}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}) = 0.7299 / 0.9689 \\approx 0.753$. Since $0.753 < 0.8$, **Criterion 2 is not met**.\n**Verdict for B**: **Incorrect**. This option fails to meet both criteria.\n\n**Option C: K$\\rightarrow$A x2 in presequence**\n1.  **Import Acceleration**: $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}} \\approx 0$. This provides no change in the unfolding rate, so the acceleration factor is $1$. **Criterion 1 is not met**. Furthermore, neutralizing positive charges in the presequence is stated to reduce the TIM23 translocation component, which would likely slow down, not accelerate, import.\n2.  **Catalytic Efficiency**: All relevant parameters ($k_{\\mathrm{cat}}, K_M, K_d$) are unaffected. The efficiency retention is $1.0$. **Criterion 2 is met**.\n**Verdict for C**: **Incorrect**. This option fails to provide the required import acceleration.\n\n**Option D: L$\\rightarrow$G in an active-site loop**\n1.  **Import Acceleration**: $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}} = +2.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$. Since $2.0 > 1.953$, **Criterion 1 is met**.\n    The acceleration factor is $\\exp(0.5625 \\times 2.0) = \\exp(1.125) \\approx 3.08$. This achieves the required $3$-fold acceleration.\n2.  **Catalytic Efficiency**: $K_M$ increases $5$-fold, while other parameters are unchanged.\n    The ratio of enzymatic efficiencies is $(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{\\mathrm{D}}/K_M^{\\mathrm{D}}) / (k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}/K_M^{\\mathrm{WT}}) = 1/5 = 0.2$.\n    Since $K_d$ is unchanged, $f_{\\mathrm{D,sub}}^{\\mathrm{D}} = f_{\\mathrm{D,sub}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$.\n    The overall efficiency retention is $0.2 \\times 1.0 = 0.2$. Since $0.2 < 0.8$, **Criterion 2 is not met**. The catalytic performance is drastically reduced.\n**Verdict for D**: **Incorrect**. Although import is accelerated, the enzyme becomes catalytically inefficient.\n\nBased on this rigorous analysis, only option A successfully meets both design criteria. It provides a substantial acceleration of import (over $5$-fold) while maintaining $90\\%$ of the wild-type catalytic efficiency. All other options fail on at least one of the two criteria. Therefore, option A is the only correct choice.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2960698"}]}
