By definition, this concentration is the product of the total concentration of Ran protein in the nucleus, $C_{\\text{Ran,tot}}^{\\text{nuc}}$, and the fraction of this Ran that is bound to GTP, $f_{\\text{GTP}}^{\\text{nuc}}$.\n$$ C_{\\text{RanGTP}}^{\\text{nuc}} = C_{\\text{Ran,tot}}^{\\text{nuc}} \\cdot f_{\\text{GTP}}^{\\text{nuc}} $$\nThe problem provides the fraction of GTP-bound Ran in the nucleus as $f_{\\text{GTP}}^{\\text{nuc}} = 0.90$. The central task is to determine the total Ran concentration in the nucleus, $C_{\\text{Ran,tot}}^{\\text{nuc}}$.\n\nThe problem statement includes two key pieces of information for this purpose. First, it provides the *cell-wide average total Ran concentration*, $C_{\\text{Ran,tot}} = 20\\ \\mu\\text{M}$, which is defined with respect to the total cellular volume, $V_{\\text{cell}} = V_{\\text{nuc}} + V_{\\text{cyto}}$. This allows us to find the total number of moles of Ran protein in the entire cell, $n_{\\text{Ran,tot}}$:\n$$ n_{\\text{Ran,tot}} = C_{\\text{Ran,tot}} \\cdot V_{\\text{cell}} $$\nSecond, the problem makes a critical assumption: \"at steady state the total Ran concentration is uniform between nucleus and cytosol.\" Let us denote this uniform concentration by $C_{\\text{Ran}}^{\\text{unif}}$. This implies that the total Ran concentration in the nucleus is equal to the total Ran concentration in the cytosol, and both are equal to this uniform value:\n$$ C_{\\text{Ran,tot}}^{\\text{nuc}} = C_{\\text{Ran,tot}}^{\\text{cyto}} = C_{\\text{Ran}}^{\\text{unif}} $$\nWe must now establish the relationship between this uniform concentration, $C_{\\text{Ran}}^{\\text{unif}}$, and the given cell-wide average concentration, $C_{\\text{Ran,tot}}$. We apply the principle of conservation of mass. The total number of Ran moles in the cell is the sum of the moles present in the nucleus ($n_{\\text{Ran}}^{\\text{nuc}}$) and the cytosol ($n_{\\text{Ran}}^{\\text{cyto}}$):\n$$ n_{\\text{Ran,tot}} = n_{\\text{Ran}}^{\\text{nuc}} + n_{\\text{Ran}}^{\\text{cyto}} $$\nUsing the definition of concentration ($n=CV$) and the uniformity assumption, we can express the number of moles in each compartment:\n$$ n_{\\text{Ran}}^{\\text{nuc}} = C_{\\text{Ran}}^{\\text{unif}} \\cdot V_{\\text{nuc}} $$\n$$ n_{\\text{Ran}}^{\\text{cyto}} = C_{\\text{Ran}}^{\\text{unif}} \\cdot V_{\\text{cyto}} $$\nSubstituting these into the conservation equation yields:\n$$ n_{\\text{Ran,tot}} = (C_{\\text{Ran}}^{\\text{unif}} \\cdot V_{\\text{nuc}}) + (C_{\\text{Ran}}^{\\text{unif}} \\cdot V_{\\text{cyto}}) = C_{\\text{Ran}}^{\\text{unif}} (V_{\\text{nuc}} + V_{\\text{cyto}}) $$\nSince $V_{\\text{cell}} = V_{\\text{nuc}} + V_{\\text{cyto}}$, we have:\n$$ n_{\\text{Ran,tot}} = C_{\\text{Ran}}^{\\text{unif}} \\cdot V_{\\text{cell}} $$\nBy equating the two derived expressions for $n_{\\text{Ran,tot}}$, we find:\n$$ C_{\\text{Ran,tot}} \\cdot V_{\\text{cell}} = C_{\\text{Ran}}^{\\text{unif}} \\cdot V_{\\text{cell}} $$\nThis relation rigorously demonstrates that the uniform concentration in each compartment is equal to the specified cell-wide average concentration:\n$$ C_{\\text{Ran}}^{\\text{unif}} = C_{\\text{Ran,tot}} $$\nTherefore, the total Ran concentration in the nucleus is $C_{\\text{Ran,tot}}^{\\text{nuc}} = C_{\\text{Ran,tot}} = 20\\ \\mu\\text{M}$.

The application of Michaelis–Menten kinetics to the RanGAP-catalyzed hydrolysis of RanGTP is a standard and appropriate model in quantitative cell biology. The provided parameters are within physically realistic ranges. We may therefore proceed directly to the solution.\n\n(a) Derivation and Computation of the Volumetric Hydrolysis Rate, $v$.\n\nThe foundational Michaelis–Menten scheme describes a single-substrate enzyme-catalyzed reaction as a two-step process. Let the enzyme be RanGAP, denoted as $E$, and the substrate be RanGTP, denoted as $S$. The enzyme and substrate reversibly form an enzyme-substrate complex, $ES$, which then irreversibly breaks down to release the product, $P$ (RanGDP and inorganic phosphate), and regenerate the free enzyme. The reaction scheme is:\n$$ E + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\xrightarrow{k_2} E + P $$\nHere, $k_1$ is the rate constant for the association of $E$ and $S$, $k_{-1}$ is the rate constant for the dissociation of the $ES$ complex, and $k_2$ is the catalytic rate constant for the conversion of $ES$ to $E$ and $P$.\n\nThe rate of formation of the $ES$ complex is governed by the following differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_1 [E][S] - (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\nThe problem states that we must use the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA). This approximation posits that after a brief initial transient, the concentration of the intermediate complex $[ES]$ remains approximately constant, meaning $\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} \\approx 0$. Applying this condition gives:\n$$ k_1 [E][S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\nThe total concentration of the enzyme, $[E]_{\\text{tot}}$, is the sum of the free enzyme concentration, $[E]$, and the concentration of the enzyme bound in the complex, $[ES]$:\n$$ [E]_{\\text{tot}} = [E] + [ES] $$\nFrom this mass balance equation, we express the free enzyme concentration as:\n$$ [E] = [E]_{\\text{tot}} - [ES] $$\nSubstituting this expression for $[E]$ into the steady-state equation yields:\n$$ k_1 ([E]_{\\text{tot}} - [ES])[S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\nWe now solve for $[ES]$. Expanding the left side gives:\n$$ k_1 [E]_{\\text{tot}}[S] - k_1 [ES][S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\nRearranging to group terms containing $[ES]$:\n$$ k_1 [E]_{\\text{tot}}[S] = (k_{-1} + k_2 + k_1[S])[ES] $$\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{k_1 [E]_{\\text{tot}}[S]}{k_{-1} + k_2 + k_1[S]} $$\nTo simplify this expression, we divide the numerator and the denominator by $k_1$:\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{[E]_{\\text{tot}}[S]}{\\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1} + [S]} $$\nThe Michaelis constant, $K_M$, is defined as the collection of rate constants $K_M \\equiv \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1}$. Substituting this definition gives the steady-state concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex:\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{[E]_{\\text{tot}}[S]}{K_M + [S]} $$\nThe volumetric reaction rate, $v$, is the rate of product formation, which is given by:\n$$ v = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_2[ES] $$\nSubstituting the expression for $[ES]$:\n$$ v = k_2 \\frac{[E]_{\\text{tot}}[S]}{K_M + [S]} $$\nIn the single-substrate Michaelis–Menten model, the catalytic turnover number, $k_{\\text{cat}}$, is equivalent to the catalytic rate constant, $k_2$. The maximum reaction velocity, $V_{\\text{max}}$, is achieved when the enzyme is fully saturated with substrate ($[S] \\to \\infty$), which means $[ES] \\to [E]_{\\text{tot}}$, and thus $V_{\\text{max}} = k_2 [E]_{\\text{tot}} = k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_{\\text{tot}}$.\n\nReplacing $k_2$ with $k_{\\text{cat}}$, we arrive at the final expression for the Michaelis–Menten equation in terms of the specified parameters:\n$$ v = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_{\\text{tot}}[S]}{K_M + [S]} $$\nIn the context of this problem, $[E]_{\\text{tot}}$ is $[\\mathrm{RanGAP}]_{\\text{tot}}$ and $[S]$ is $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]$. Therefore, the specific expression is:\n$$ v = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}[\\mathrm{RanGAP}]_{\\text{tot}}[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]}{K_M + [\\mathrm{RanGTP}]} $$\nThis completes the derivation. Now, we compute the numerical value of $v$ using the provided data:\n- $[\\mathrm{RanGAP}]_{\\text{tot}} = 0.20\\ \\mu\\text{M}$\n- $k_{\\text{cat}} = 30\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n- $K_M = 2\\ \\mu\\text{M}$\n- $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}] = 5\\ \\mu\\text{M}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$ v = \\frac{(30\\ \\text{s}^{-1})(0.20\\ \\mu\\text{M})(5\\ \\mu\\text{M})}{2\\ \\mu\\text{M} + 5\\ \\mu\\text{M}} $$\n$$ v = \\frac{30\\ \\mu\\text{M}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}}{7\\ \\mu\\text{M}} $$\n$$ v = \\frac{30}{7}\\ \\mu\\text{M} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ v \\approx 4.285714... \\ \\mu\\text{M} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, as requested:\n$$ v = 4.286\\ \\mu\\text{M} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1} $$\n\n(b) Interpretation of RanGAP Saturation and Gradient Robustness.\n\nThe Michaelis constant, $K_M$, represents the substrate concentration at which the reaction velocity is half of its maximum value, $V_{\\text{max}}$. In this case, $K_M = 2\\ \\mu\\text{M}$. The cytosolic substrate concentration is $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}] = 5\\ \\mu\\text{M}$.\n\nSince $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}] > K_M$ (specifically, $[\\mathrm{RanGTP}] = 2.5 \\times K_M$), the enzyme RanGAP is operating at a rate significantly above half its maximal capacity. The degree of saturation can be quantified by the ratio of the current velocity $v$ to the maximal velocity $V_{\\text{max}}$. First, we calculate $V_{\\text{max}}$:\n$$ V_{\\text{max}} = k_{\\text{cat}}[\\mathrm{RanGAP}]_{\\text{tot}} = (30\\ \\text{s}^{-1})(0.20\\ \\mu\\text{M}) = 6\\ \\mu\\text{M} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1} $$\nThe fractional velocity is:\n$$ \\frac{v}{V_{\\text{max}}} = \\frac{4.286\\ \\mu\\text{M} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}}{6\\ \\mu\\text{M} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}} \\approx 0.714 $$\nAlternatively, from the Michaelis-Menten equation, this ratio is given by $\\frac{[\\mathrm{RanGTP}]}{K_M + [\\mathrm{RanGTP}]} = \\frac{5}{2+5} = \\frac{5}{7} \\approx 0.714$. With approximately $71\\%$ of its active sites occupied and turning over substrate, RanGAP is operating well into its saturation regime, though it is not completely saturated.\n\nThis near-saturating condition has a direct implication for the robustness of the RanGTP gradient. The RanGTP gradient is maintained by high RanGTP concentration in the nucleus and low concentration in the cytosol. RanGAP's function is to act as a cytosolic \"sink\" by rapidly hydrolyzing any RanGTP that exits the nucleus. When the enzyme operates near saturation, its rate of hydrolysis becomes less sensitive to increases in substrate concentration. The rate is approaching a plateau at $V_{\\text{max}}$.\n\nConsequently, if there is a transient surge in RanGTP efflux from the nucleus through the NPCs, the cytosolic RanGAP system will not be able to increase its hydrolysis rate proportionally. The rate will increase, but only from $71\\%$ of $V_{\\text{max}}$ towards $100\\%$. This provides a limited capacity to buffer the surge. A large, sudden influx of RanGTP could temporarily overwhelm the clearance capacity of RanGAP, leading to a transient increase in cytosolic RanGTP concentration and a partial, temporary collapse of the sharp nucleocytoplasmic gradient. The system is robust for steady-state maintenance but demonstrates diminished responsiveness to large, transient perturbations.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{4.286} $$", "id": "2961453"}, {"introduction": "Having examined static concentrations and a key kinetic step, we can now synthesize these concepts into a comprehensive model of the entire Ran cycle.

Then $N_x = \\frac{R_{\\text{tot}}}{S}$.\n\nNow, substitute the given parameter values:\n$k_{\\text{gef}} = 1.0 \\text{ s}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\text{exp}} = 0.5 \\text{ s}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\text{gap}} = 1.0 \\text{ s}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\text{ntf2}} = 2.0 \\text{ s}^{-1}$\n$R_{\\text{tot}} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-17}$ mol\n$V_{n} = 0.5 \\text{ pL} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ L}$\n$V_{c} = 2.0 \\text{ pL} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ L}$\n\nCalculate the sum $S$:\n$$S = 1 + \\frac{0.5}{1.0} + \\frac{0.5}{1.0} + \\frac{0.5}{2.0} = 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 2.25$$\n\nNow we solve for the amounts of each species:\n$N_x = \\frac{R_{\\text{tot}}}{S} = \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^{-17}}{2.25} \\text{ mol} = \\frac{10}{9} \\times 10^{-17} \\text{ mol}$\n$N_y = \\frac{k_{\\text{exp}}}{k_{\\text{gef}}} N_x = \\frac{0.5}{1.0} \\left(\\frac{10}{9} \\times 10^{-17}\\right) \\text{ mol} = \\frac{5}{9} \\times 10^{-17} \\text{ mol}$\n$N_u = \\frac{k_{\\text{exp}}}{k_{\\text{gap}}} N_x = \\frac{0.5}{1.0} \\left(\\frac{10}{9} \\times 10^{-17}\\right) \\text{ mol} = \\frac{5}{9} \\times 10^{-17} \\text{ mol}$\n$N_v = \\frac{k_{\\text{exp}}}{k_{\\text{ntf2}}} N_x = \\frac{0.5}{2.0} \\left(\\frac{10}{9} \\times 10^{-17}\\right) \\text{ mol} = \\frac{2.5}{9} \\times 10^{-17} = \\frac{5}{18} \\times 10^{-17} \\text{ mol}$\n\nFinally, we calculate the concentrations in units of micromolar ($\\mu$M, or $10^{-6}$ mol/L).\n$x = \\frac{N_x}{V_n} = \\frac{\\frac{10}{9} \\times 10^{-17} \\text{ mol}}{0.5 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ L}} = \\frac{20}{9} \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ M} = \\frac{20}{9} \\times 10^{-5} \\times 10^6 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M} \\approx 22.2222 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M}$\n$y = \\frac{N_y}{V_n} = \\frac{\\frac{5}{9} \\times 10^{-17} \\text{ mol}}{0.5 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ L}} = \\frac{10}{9} \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ M} = \\frac{10}{9} \\times 10^{-5} \\times 10^6 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M} \\approx 11.1111 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M}$\n$u = \\frac{N_u}{V_c} = \\frac{\\frac{5}{9} \\times 10^{-17} \\text{ mol}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ L}} = \\frac{5}{18} \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ M} = \\frac{5}{18} \\times 10^{-5} \\times 10^6 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M} \\approx 2.7777 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M}$\n$v = \\frac{N_v}{V_c} = \\frac{\\frac{5}{18} \\times 10^{-17} \\text{ mol}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ L}} = \\frac{5}{36} \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ M} = \\frac{5}{36} \\times 10^{-5} \\times 10^6 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M} \\approx 1.3888 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M}$\n\nRounding these values to four significant figures as required:\n$x = 22.22 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M}$\n$y = 11.11 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M}$\n$u = 2.778 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M}$\n$v = 1.389 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M}$\n\nThe final answer is presented as a row matrix $[x \\;\\; y \\;\\; u \\;\\; v]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 22.22 & 11.11 & 2.778 & 1.389 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2961429"}]}
