Proline (`P`) is excluded near the scissile bond.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as it is based on the well-established signal hypothesis and the empirical rules for signal peptide structure and cleavage described by Gunnar von Heijne, which are fundamental concepts in molecular and cell biology. The problem is well-posed, providing a specific sequence and a set of rules for its analysis, asking for the \"most probable\" site, which implies a logical deduction based on the provided facts. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and does not contain contradictory information or scientifically implausible data. The sequence itself is a realistic example of a signal peptide.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will now proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\nThe task is to apply the given principles to the sequence `M(1) K(2) K(3) S(4) L(5) V(6) L(7) V(8) A(9) L(10) A(11) L(12) A(13) G(14) A(15) S(16) A(17)`.\n\nLet us analyze the sequence structure.\n1.  **N-region**: The sequence begins with `MKK...`. Lysine (`K`) is a positively charged amino acid. The presence of two `K` residues at positions `$2$` and `$3$` establishes a clear, positively charged N-region, consistent with the first architectural principle.\n2.  **H-region**: Following the N-region, there must be a hydrophobic core. The sequence segment `...SLVLVALALAG...` contains a stretch of highly hydrophobic amino acids: Leucine (`L`), Valine (`V`), and Alanine (`A`). The sequence `LVLVALALA` from position `$7$` to `$13$` forms a strong hydrophobic core. Serine (`S`) at position `$4$` is polar, but it is common for the H-region to begin after a few residues following the N-region.\n3.  **C-region and Cleavage Site**: The C-region is a more polar region that contains the cleavage site, which is governed by the von Heijne rule. The rule states that residues at positions `$-3$` and `$-1$` relative to the cleavage site must be small and neutral. Common examples of such residues are Alanine (`A`), Glycine (`G`), Serine (`S`), Threonine (`T`), and Cysteine (`C`). We must now evaluate each proposed cleavage site.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. MKKSLVLVALALAG A|SA; justified because residues at `$-3$` and `$-1$` are Ala and Ala, respectively, forming a canonical Ala–X–Ala motif; the upstream stretch conforms to an N-region (positively charged Lys–Lys), followed by a sufficiently hydrophobic H-region, and a short, less hydrophobic C-region with a small residue at `$+1$` (Ser), all consistent with co-translational signal peptidase recognition.**\n\n-   **Proposed Cleavage Site**: Between `A(15)` and `S(16)`. The sequence context is `...A(13)G(14)A(15)|S(16)A(17)`.\n-   **Applying the von Heijne Rule**:\n    -   The residue at position `$-1$` is `A(15)` (Alanine). This is a small, neutral amino acid. This is correct.\n    -   The residue at position `$-3$` is `A(13)` (Alanine). This is also a small, neutral amino acid. This is correct.\n-   **Analysis of Justification**: The justification states that the residues at `$-3$` and `$-1$` are `Ala` and `Ala`. This is factually correct for the proposed site (`A(13)` and `A(15)`). The motif `A-X-A`, specifically `A(13)-G(14)-A(15)`, is a very strong and canonical signal for cleavage by signal peptidase. The overall structure is also correctly described: a positively charged N-region (`MKK`), a long hydrophobic H-region (`SLVLVALALA`), and a C-region (`GA`) preceding the cut. The residue at the `$+1$` position, `S(16)` (Serine), is small and polar, which is also a favorable feature for the start of the mature protein. The entire justification is sound and aligns perfectly with all the provided principles.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. MKKSLVLVALALAGAS|A; justified because residues at `$-3$` and `$-1$` are Gly and Ser, respectively, both small; the C-region length of `$3$` residues is required for cleavage.**\n\n-   **Proposed Cleavage Site**: Between `S(16)` and `A(17)`. The sequence context is `...G(14)A(15)S(16)|A(17)`.\n-   **Applying the von Heijne Rule**:\n    -   The residue at position `$-1$` is `S(16)` (Serine). This is a small, neutral/polar amino acid. This is acceptable.\n    -   The residue at position `$-3$` is `G(14)` (Glycine). This is a small, neutral amino acid. This is acceptable.\n-   **Analysis of Justification**: While the `G-X-S` motif is permissible, it is generally considered a weaker signal than the `A-X-A` motif found in option A. Furthermore, the justification includes the claim that \"the C-region length of `$3$` residues is required for cleavage,\" which is not a stated foundational fact in the problem description and is an overly rigid generalization. The site in option A provides a much stronger, canonical signal.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. MKKSLVLVALAL AG|ASA; justified because residues at `$-3$` and `$-1$` are Leu and Gly, respectively, and the hydrophobic stretch ends just before this position, placing the scissile bond at the H-to-C transition.**\n\n-   **Proposed Cleavage Site**: Between `G(14)` and `A(15)`. The sequence context is `...L(12)A(13)G(14)|A(15)S(16)...`.\n-   **Applying the von Heijne Rule**:\n    -   The residue at position `$-1$` is `G(14)` (Glycine). This is small and neutral. This is acceptable.\n    -   The residue at position `$-3$` is `L(12)` (Leucine). Leucine is a large, bulky hydrophobic amino acid. This **violates** the von Heijne rule, which requires small, neutral residues at this position.\n-   **Analysis of Justification**: The justification correctly identifies the residues, but fails to recognize that `Leu` at position `$-3$` is a strong negative determinant for cleavage. Therefore, the justification leads to an incorrect conclusion.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. No cleavage is expected within this segment because the positively charged Lys residues near the N-terminus violate the von Heijne `($-3,-1$)` rule and preclude signal peptidase action.**\n\n-   **Analysis of Justification**: This statement fundamentally misunderstands the structure of a signal peptide. The positively charged `Lys` residues constitute the N-region, which is a required feature of a signal peptide, not an inhibitor of cleavage. The von Heijne `($-3,-1$)` rule applies only to the three residues immediately upstream of the cleavage site, which is located at the end of the peptide, far from the N-terminal `Lys` residues. This reasoning is flawed.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. MKKSLVLV ALA|LAGASA; justified because residues at `$-3$` and `$-1$` are Ala and Ala, respectively, matching the Ala–X–Ala motif; this earlier site is preferred to maximize C-region compactness.**\n\n-   **Proposed Cleavage Site**: Between `A(9)` and `L(10)`. The sequence context is `...L(7)V(8)A(9)|L(10)A(11)...`.\n-   **Applying the von Heijne Rule**:\n    -   The residue at position `$-1$` is `A(9)` (Alanine). This is small and neutral. Acceptable.\n    -   The residue at position `$-3$` is `L(7)` (Leucine). This is a large, bulky hydrophobic amino acid. This **violates** the von Heijne rule.\n-   **Analysis of Justification**: The justification claims that residues at `$-3$` and `$-1$` are both `Ala`. This is factually false for the proposed cleavage site; the residue at `$-3$` is `Len`. The justification is internally inconsistent and describes a different sequence context than the one proposed. Cleavage would also occur within the hydrophobic H-region, which is atypical.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn summary, the cleavage site proposed in option A is the only one that perfectly satisfies the von Heijne `($-3, -1$)` rule with a strong canonical `A-X-A` motif, and the overall peptide structure (N-H-C regions) is consistent with this site. The justification provided in option A is a complete and accurate application of the given principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2966280"}, {"introduction": "Understanding a biological pathway often involves studying what happens when it malfunctions.

The experimental data (mass shift, Endo H sensitivity, proteasome inhibitor effect, membrane extraction) are standard and interpreted correctly. The known substrate specificity of ER signal peptidase, particularly its intolerance for proline at positions $-1$ and $-3$, is a core biochemical fact relevant to this problem.

All necessary information is present.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, objective scientific language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically valid, well-posed, and objective. It contains no inconsistencies or flaws. Therefore, I will proceed with the solution derivation and analysis of the options.\n\n**Solution Derivation and Option Analysis**\n\nThe foundational principles of co-translational translocation dictate the fate of a secretory protein. The N-terminal signal peptide targets the nascent polypeptide to the ER membrane via the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) and the SRP receptor. The polypeptide is then threaded through the Sec61 translocon. A critical step for soluble secretory proteins is the cleavage of the signal peptide by the ER signal peptidase complex (SPC), a luminal/membrane-associated enzyme complex. This cleavage releases the mature polypeptide into the ER lumen for proper folding and subsequent transport through the secretory pathway.\n\nThe specificity of the SPC is well-characterized. It recognizes a consensus site defined by the residues flanking the scissile bond. In particular, the positions $-1$ and $-3$ (relative to the cleavage site) must be occupied by small, neutral amino acids (such as Alanine, Glycine, Serine). Proline is an imino acid with a rigid five-membered ring structure. Its presence at position $-1$ introduces significant steric hindrance and conformational constraints that are incompatible with the active site of the signal peptidase. Therefore, the primary and most direct consequence of a proline mutation at position $-1$ is the inhibition of signal peptide cleavage.\n\nLet us trace the consequences of this cleavage failure and compare them with the provided experimental data:\n1.  **Retention of the Signal Peptide:** If the signal peptide is not cleaved, it remains covalently attached to the N-terminus of the protein. This directly explains the observation of \"No detectable decrease in apparent molecular mass,\" as the protein would retain the mass of the signal peptide (given as approximately $2.5\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$).\n2.  **Membrane Anchoring:** The hydrophobic core of the uncleaved signal peptide, which was inserted into the Sec61 channel and the lipid bilayer during translocation, will now function as a permanent N-terminal transmembrane anchor. This converts the erstwhile soluble secretory protein into a Type I-like transmembrane protein, or more accurately, an \"N-terminally anchored species.\" This is perfectly consistent with the results of the carbonate extraction and protease protection assays.\n3.  **ER Retention:** The protein is now incorrectly processed and membrane-anchored instead of being soluble in the ER lumen. This aberrant state can lead to misfolding. The ER quality control system, involving chaperones and folding sensors, recognizes such improperly processed or misfolded proteins and prevents their exit from the ER. This explains the failure to acquire complex glycans (which are added in the Golgi) and the resulting sensitivity to Endoglycosidase H.\n4.  **ER-Associated Degradation (ERAD):** Proteins that are terminally misfolded or cannot be properly processed are targeted by the ERAD pathway for degradation. The protein is retro-translocated from the ER back into the cytosol, ubiquitinated, and degraded by the proteasome. Inhibition of the proteasome with MG132 would cause the protein to accumulate, which is exactly what was observed.\n\nThis chain of events provides a complete and self-consistent explanation for all the experimental phenotypes. Now, let us evaluate the given options based on this analysis.\n\n**Option A:** The $-1$ proline eliminates hydrophobicity in the signal peptide core, abolishing SRP binding and ER targeting; the polypeptide remains cytosolic and is degraded by the cytosolic proteasome.\nThis is **Incorrect**. The mutation is at position $-1$, which is part of the polar C-region of the signal peptide, not the hydrophobic core. It would not affect SRP binding. The experimental data clearly show the protein is targeted to the ER, as it becomes membrane-associated and is N-glycosylated (making it Endo H sensitive). Cytosolic localization is contradicted by the evidence.\n\n**Option B:** The $-1$ proline violates the residue preference immediately N-terminal to the scissile bond required by the ER signal peptidase (often small, neutral residues at positions $-3$ and $-1$), preventing cleavage. The uncleaved signal peptide persists as an N-terminal membrane anchor, impeding complete luminal release and proper folding; ER quality control retains the protein and directs it to ERAD.\nThis is **Correct**. This option accurately describes the entire causal chain derived from first principles. It correctly identifies the primary defect (inhibition of signal peptidase), the direct consequence (retention of the signal peptide as a membrane anchor), and the downstream cellular responses (ER retention via quality control and degradation via ERAD). This mechanism explains all four pieces of experimental data.\n\n**Option C:** The $-1$ proline creates a Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) retrieval motif at the protein’s C terminus, causing retrograde trafficking from the Golgi to the ER and retention independent of signal peptide processing.\nThis is **Incorrect**. A single amino acid substitution at the N-terminus cannot create a four-amino-acid motif at the C-terminus. The mechanism of retention is a C-terminal retrieval signal, which is inconsistent with the primary defect being at the N-terminus. Furthermore, the data indicate a failure in initial processing (cleavage) and ER retention, not retrograde transport from the Golgi.\n\n**Option D:** The $-1$ proline reverses the charge distribution of the signal peptide N-region, inverting topology to a type II orientation; cleavage proceeds normally, but the absence of a downstream stop-transfer sequence traps the protein in the ER.\nThis is **Incorrect**. Proline is uncharged and is not located in the N-region; it cannot reverse the charge distribution that determines initial topology. Most importantly, this option claims that \"cleavage proceeds normally,\" which is in direct contradiction to the experimental data showing no decrease in molecular mass.\n\n**Option E:** The $-1$ proline hyperactivates intramembrane signal peptide peptidase, causing excessive cleavage and release of the protein into the cytosol where it is degraded via the N-end rule pathway.\nThis is **Incorrect**. This option makes two fundamental errors. First, it confuses the signal peptidase complex (SPC) with signal peptide peptidase (SPP). SPP acts *after* SPC. Second, it claims \"hyperactivates\" and \"excessive cleavage,\" which is the exact opposite of the observed outcome (no cleavage).

Modeling this process with first-order kinetics is a standard and scientifically sound simplification used in systems biology.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It describes a clear kinetic scheme with defined states and transitions. The rates are given as constants, and the assumptions (memoryless, first-order processes) are explicitly stated, which corresponds to a continuous-time Markov chain model. The objective, to calculate a probability, is a well-defined mathematical task that has a unique solution based on the provided information.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is precise, quantitative, and free of subjectivity. Terms such as \"rate constant\", \"first-order process\", and \"exponentially distributed\" have unambiguous definitions in chemical kinetics and probability theory.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained and consistent. It provides all necessary rate constants and defines the sequence of events and competing pathways. The statement that \"translation termination competes at all times prior to ER engagement\" clearly specifies that termination is a possible outcome from both the initial SRP-unbound state and the intermediate SRP-bound state. This is crucial and unambiguous.\n5.  **Plausibility**: The numerical values for the rate constants are plausible for biological processes, which often occur on a timescale of seconds to minutes. The model, though simplified, is not scientifically implausible.\n\nThe verdict of this validation is that the problem is **valid**. It is a standard problem in stochastic kinetics applied to a biological context. I will now proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe process of co-translational targeting can be modeled as a sequence of stochastic events. Let us define the relevant states of the ribosome-nascent chain complex (RNC):\n- State $S_{0}$: The initial state at time $t=0$, where the RNC has an exposed signal peptide but is not yet bound by SRP.\n- State $S_{1}$: The intermediate state, where SRP is bound to the RNC (RNC-SRP).\n- State $S_{2}$: The final successful state, where the RNC-SRP complex has engaged the ER translocon. This is an absorbing state representing successful targeting.\n- State $S_{3}$: The final failure state, where translation has terminated before successful targeting. This is also an absorbing state.\n\nThe transitions between these states are governed by first-order rate constants as follows:\n1.  From state $S_{0}$, two competing processes can occur:\n    -   Binding of SRP, leading to state $S_{1}$: $S_{0} \\xrightarrow{k_{bind}} S_{1}$\n    -   Termination of translation, leading to state $S_{3}$: $S_{0} \\xrightarrow{k_{term}} S_{3}$\n2.  From state $S_{1}$, two competing processes can occur:\n    -   Engagement with the ER translocon, leading to state $S_{2}$: $S_{1} \\xrightarrow{k_{enc}} S_{2}$\n    -   Termination of translation, leading to state $S_{3}$: $S_{1} \\xrightarrow{k_{term}} S_{3}$\n\nThe problem asks for $P_{target}$, the probability that the system reaches state $S_{2}$. This requires a successful transition from $S_{0}$ to $S_{1}$, followed by a successful transition from $S_{1}$ to $S_{2}$.\n\nThe assumption of memoryless, first-order processes implies that the waiting time for any event is exponentially distributed. For a set of competing independent first-order processes, the probability that a specific process $i$ with rate $k_{i}$ occurs before any other competing process is given by the ratio of its rate to the sum of the rates of all competing processes.\n\nLet $P_{0 \\to 1}$ be the probability that the system transitions from $S_{0}$ to $S_{1}$. This is the probability that SRP binding occurs before termination. The competing rates out of $S_{0}$ are $k_{bind}$ and $k_{term}$. Therefore, the probability of the binding event occurring first is:\n$$ P_{0 \\to 1} = \\frac{k_{bind}}{k_{bind} + k_{term}} $$\n\nIf this step is successful, the system enters state $S_{1}$. Now, let $P_{1 \\to 2}$ be the probability that the system transitions from $S_{1}$ to $S_{2}$. This is the probability that ER engagement occurs before termination. The competing rates out of $S_{1}$ are $k_{enc}$ and $k_{term}$. The probability of the engagement event occurring first is:\n$$ P_{1 \\to 2} = \\frac{k_{enc}}{k_{enc} + k_{term}} $$\n\nThe overall probability of successful targeting, $P_{target}$, is the probability of the sequence of events $S_{0} \\to S_{1} \\to S_{2}$. Since the process is Markovian (memoryless), the probability of the sequence is the product of the probabilities of the individual steps.\n$$ P_{target} = P_{0 \\to 1} \\times P_{1 \\to 2} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the individual probabilities gives the final closed-form expression:\n$$ P_{target} = \\left( \\frac{k_{bind}}{k_{bind} + k_{term}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{k_{enc}}{k_{enc} + k_{term}} \\right) $$\n\nNow, we must evaluate this expression for the given numerical values: $k_{bind} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{enc} = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and $k_{term} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ are consistent and cancel out, yielding a dimensionless probability, as is correct.\n\nSubstituting the values into the derived expression:\n$$ P_{target} = \\left( \\frac{0.8}{0.8 + 0.5} \\right) \\left( \\frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.5} \\right) $$\n$$ P_{target} = \\left( \\frac{0.8}{1.3} \\right) \\left( \\frac{0.2}{0.7} \\right) $$\n$$ P_{target} = \\frac{0.8 \\times 0.2}{1.3 \\times 0.7} = \\frac{0.16}{0.91} $$\n$$ P_{target} \\approx 0.1758241758... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ P_{target} \\approx 0.1758 $$\nThis is the final numerical answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1758}$$", "id": "2966382"}]}
