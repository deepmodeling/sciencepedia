A solution will be provided.\n\nThe foundation of this problem is the principle of thermodynamic equilibrium between two phases.

The chemical potential of a species in an ideal dilute solution is given by the expression:\n$$\n\\mu = \\mu^{\\circ} + k_{\\text{B}}T \\ln(c)\n$$\nwhere $\\mu^{\\circ}$ is the standard-state chemical potential, $k_{\\text{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $c$ is the concentration of the species.\n\nFor the bulk cytosol, the chemical potential of the receptor is:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{bulk}} = \\mu^{\\circ}_{\\text{bulk}} + k_{\\text{B}}T \\ln(c_{\\text{bulk}})\n$$\n\nFor the FG phase, the receptor not only has a concentration-dependent term but also experiences a change in potential energy due to binding interactions with the FG-repeats. This is given as the binding free energy per molecule, $\\Delta G$. This energy term contributes directly to the chemical potential. Therefore, the chemical potential of the receptor in the FG phase is:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{FG}} = \\mu^{\\circ}_{\\text{FG}} + k_{\\text{B}}T \\ln(c_{\\text{FG}}) + \\Delta G\n$$\nThe term $\\Delta G$ represents the non-ideal contribution to the free energy from interactions, relative to the bulk phase.\n\nThe condition for equilibrium is $\\mu_{\\text{bulk}} = \\mu_{\\text{FG}}$.

This yields a system of four linear algebraic equations. Additionally, the total concentration of Ran is conserved: $R_{T}^{n} + R_{D}^{n} + R_{T}^{c} + R_{D}^{c} = R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$. Since the sum of the derivatives is zero, one rate equation is redundant, and we solve the system of three independent rate equations with the conservation law.\n\nThe steady-state equations are:\n1. $k_{\\mathrm{ge}} R_{D}^{n} - (f g + k_{T}) R_{T}^{n} + k_{T} R_{T}^{c} = 0$\n2. $f g R_{T}^{n} - (k_{\\mathrm{ge}} + k_{D}) R_{D}^{n} + k_{D} R_{D}^{c} = 0$\n3. $k_{T} R_{T}^{n} - ((1-f) g + k_{T}) R_{T}^{c} = 0$\n4. $R_{T}^{n} + R_{D}^{n} + R_{T}^{c} + R_{D}^{c} = R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$\n\nTo solve for the concentrations, we express all other concentrations in terms of $R_{T}^{n}$.\nFrom equation (3), we find $R_{T}^{c}$:\n$$ R_{T}^{c} = \\frac{k_{T}}{(1-f) g + k_{T}} R_{T}^{n} $$\nFrom equation (1), we solve for $R_{D}^{n}$:\n$$ R_{D}^{n} = \\frac{(f g + k_{T}) R_{T}^{n} - k_{T} R_{T}^{c}}{k_{\\mathrm{ge}}} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{ge}}} \\left( (f g + k_{T}) - \\frac{k_{T}^2}{(1-f)g + k_{T}} \\right) R_{T}^{n} $$\nSimplifying the term in parenthesis gives:\n$$ R_{D}^{n} = \\frac{g^2f(1-f) + gk_T}{k_{\\mathrm{ge}}((1-f)g + k_T)} R_{T}^{n} $$\nThe fourth rate equation, for $R_D^c$, at steady state is $(1-f) g R_{T}^{c} + k_{D} R_{D}^{n} - k_{D} R_{D}^{c} = 0$, which gives:\n$$ R_{D}^{c} = R_{D}^{n} + \\frac{(1-f) g}{k_{D}} R_{T}^{c} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $R_T^c$ and $R_D^n$ gives $R_D^c$ also as a function of $R_T^n$.\n\nNow we substitute these into the conservation law:\n$$ R_{T}^{n} + R_{D}^{n} + R_{T}^{c} + \\left( R_{D}^{n} + \\frac{(1-f) g}{k_{D}} R_{T}^{c} \\right) = R_{\\mathrm{tot}} $$\n$$ R_{T}^{n} \\left( 1 + \\left(1 + \\frac{(1-f)g}{k_D}\\right)\\frac{R_{T}^{c}}{R_{T}^{n}} + 2\\frac{R_{D}^{n}}{R_{T}^{n}} \\right) = R_{\\mathrm{tot}} $$\nLet $\\alpha = R_{T}^{c}/R_{T}^{n}$ and $\\beta = R_{D}^{n}/R_{T}^{n}$.\n$$ R_{T}^{n} \\left( 1 + \\alpha \\left(1 + \\frac{(1-f)g}{k_D}\\right) + 2\\beta \\right) = R_{\\mathrm{tot}} $$\n$$ R_{T}^{n} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{1 + \\alpha (1 + \\frac{(1-f)g}{k_D}) + 2\\beta} $$\nWe now substitute the given parameter values: $k_{\\mathrm{ge}} = 2$, $g = 2$, $k_{T} = 0.5$, $k_{D} = 0.5$, $f = 0.3$, and $R_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 10$. Note that $1-f = 0.7$.\nFirst, calculate the coefficients $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k_{T}}{(1-f)g + k_{T}} = \\frac{0.5}{0.7 \\times 2 + 0.5} = \\frac{0.5}{1.4 + 0.5} = \\frac{0.5}{1.9} = \\frac{5}{19} $$\n$$ \\beta = \\frac{g^2f(1-f) + gk_T}{k_{\\mathrm{ge}}((1-f)g + k_T)} = \\frac{2^2(0.3)(0.7) + 2(0.5)}{2(0.7 \\times 2 + 0.5)} = \\frac{4(0.21) + 1}{2(1.9)} = \\frac{0.84 + 1}{3.8} = \\frac{1.84}{3.8} = \\frac{46}{95} $$\nNow we compute the denominator of the expression for $R_{T}^{n}$:\n$$ 1 + \\alpha \\left(1 + \\frac{(1-f)g}{k_D}\\right) + 2\\beta = 1 + \\frac{5}{19} \\left(1 + \\frac{1.4}{0.5}\\right) + 2\\left(\\frac{46}{95}\\right) $$\n$$ = 1 + \\frac{5}{19} (1 + 2.8) + \\frac{92}{95} = 1 + \\frac{5}{19} (3.8) + \\frac{92}{95} $$\n$$ = 1 + \\frac{5}{19} \\left(\\frac{38}{10}\\right) + \\frac{92}{95} = 1 + 1 + \\frac{92}{95} = 2 + \\frac{92}{95} = \\frac{190 + 92}{95} = \\frac{282}{95} $$\nSo, the steady-state concentration of nuclear RanGTP is:\n$$ R_{T}^{n} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{282/95} = \\frac{10}{282/95} = 10 \\times \\frac{95}{282} = \\frac{950}{282} = \\frac{475}{141} \\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} $$\nThe final step is to calculate the net transport bias, $J_{\\mathrm{exp}} - J_{\\mathrm{imp}}$.\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{exp}} - J_{\\mathrm{imp}} = k_{E} (1-f) R_{T}^{n} - k_{I} R_{T}^{n} = (k_{E}(1-f) - k_{I}) R_{T}^{n} $$\nUsing the parameter values $k_{I} = 0.3$, $k_{E} = 0.4$, and $f = 0.3$:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{exp}} - J_{\\mathrm{imp}} = (0.4 \\times 0.7 - 0.3) \\times \\frac{475}{141} $$\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{exp}} - J_{\\mathrm{imp}} = (0.28 - 0.3) \\times \\frac{475}{141} = -0.02 \\times \\frac{475}{141} $$\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{exp}} - J_{\\mathrm{imp}} = -\\frac{2}{100} \\times \\frac{475}{141} = -\\frac{950}{14100} = -\\frac{95}{1410} = -\\frac{19}{282} $$\nAs a decimal, this is approximately $-0.067375886...$.
