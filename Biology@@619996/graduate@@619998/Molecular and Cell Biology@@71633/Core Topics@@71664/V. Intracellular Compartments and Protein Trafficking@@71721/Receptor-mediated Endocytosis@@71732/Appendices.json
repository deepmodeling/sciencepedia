Assume the following experimentally supported conditions: (i) receptor binding and unbinding reach quasi-equilibrium rapidly compared to vesicle internalization, so that binding can be treated at thermodynamic equilibrium; (ii) the extracellular ligand concentration remains effectively constant during binding because the surface receptor abundance is small relative to the total ligand present in the medium; and (iii) internalization rate is proportional to the number of ligand-bound receptors at the membrane, reflecting saturation kinetics as occupancy approaches unity. Let the receptor have a dissociation constant $K_d$ (defined by the equilibrium relation for $R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$), and let the extracellular ligand concentration be $[L]$.\n\nStarting from the definition of the dissociation constant and the law of mass action, derive an expression for the fractional receptor occupancy $f$ (the fraction of total receptors that are ligand-bound at equilibrium) in terms of $[L]$ and $K_d$. Then, using the qualitative criterion that when $[L] \\ll K_d$ uptake is limited by ligand availability (ligand-limited) whereas when $[L] \\gg K_d$ uptake is limited by receptor availability (receptor-limited), map the regime decision into a binary limitation code $\\lambda$ defined by $\\lambda = 0$ for ligand-limited and $\\lambda = 1$ for receptor-limited.

It is based on the fundamental principles of chemical equilibrium as applied to receptor-ligand binding, a standard topic in molecular biology and biophysics. All definitions and conditions are provided, and the required calculations follow logically from the premises. The problem is therefore deemed valid and will be solved as formulated.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the equilibrium description of a reversible bimolecular reaction. The reaction between a free receptor, $R$, and a ligand, $L$, to form a receptor-ligand complex, $RL$, is given by:\n$$\nR + L \\rightleftharpoons RL\n$$\nThe dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the law of mass action at equilibrium:\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}\n$$\nwhere $[R]$, $[L]$, and $[RL]$ represent the molar concentrations of free receptors, free ligand, and receptor-ligand complexes, respectively.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the fractional receptor occupancy, $f$. This quantity is defined as the ratio of the concentration of ligand-bound receptors to the total concentration of receptors, $[R_T]$. The total receptor concentration is the sum of free and bound receptors:\n$$\n[R_T] = [R] + [RL]\n$$\nBy definition, the fractional occupancy is:\n$$\nf = \\frac{[RL]}{[R_T]} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]}\n$$\nTo express $f$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_d$, we must eliminate $[R]$ and $[RL]$ from this expression, or rather, express their ratio in terms of the given parameters. From the definition of $K_d$, we can express the concentration of free receptors, $[R]$, as:\n$$\n[R] = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $[R]$ into the formula for $f$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{[RL]}{\\left(\\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]}\\right) + [RL]}\n$$\nThe term $[RL]$ is a common factor in the denominator and can be factored out:\n$$\nf = \\frac{[RL]}{[RL] \\left(\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1\\right)}\n$$\nAssuming $[RL] > 0$, which is required for any binding to occur, we can cancel this term from the numerator and denominator:\n$$\nf = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1}\n$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $[L]$ yields the final, standard form of the expression, known as the Hill-Langmuir equation for a non-cooperative system:\n$$\nf = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}\n$$\nThis expression gives the fractional receptor occupancy at equilibrium as a function of only the ligand concentration $[L]$ and the dissociation constant $K_d$. This completes the first part of the task.\n\nNext, we must apply this derived formula to the specific case where $K_d = 10\\ \\mathrm{nM}$ and $[L] = 5\\ \\mathrm{nM}$. Substituting these values directly into the expression for $f$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{5\\ \\mathrm{nM}}{10\\ \\mathrm{nM} + 5\\ \\mathrm{nM}} = \\frac{5}{15}\n$$\nThe problem requires an exact fraction. Simplifying this fraction gives:\n$$\nf = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nThis is the fractional occupancy. It is a dimensionless quantity, as it must be.\n\nThe final part of the task is to determine the limitation code, $\\lambda$. The problem provides a precise criterion for this specific case: the system is considered ligand-limited ($\\lambda = 0$) if $[L] < K_d$ and, by implication, receptor-limited ($\\lambda = 1$) if $[L] \\geq K_d$. This is a practical application of the qualitative notions that when $[L] \\ll K_d$, uptake is limited by ligand availability, and when $[L] \\gg K_d$, uptake is limited by the finite number of receptors.\n\nWe are given $[L] = 5\\ \\mathrm{nM}$ and $K_d = 10\\ \\mathrm{nM}$. We perform the comparison:\n$$\n5\\ \\mathrm{nM} < 10\\ \\mathrm{nM}\n$$\nThus, the condition $[L] < K_d$ is satisfied. According to the problem's convention, this corresponds to the ligand-limited regime. Therefore, the limitation code is:\n$$\n\\lambda = 0\n$$\nThe final answer is required as a single row matrix containing the values for $f$ and $\\lambda$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{3} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2962161"}, {"introduction": "Following ligand binding, the receptor-ligand complex must be recognized by the intracellular endocytic machinery to be internalized.
