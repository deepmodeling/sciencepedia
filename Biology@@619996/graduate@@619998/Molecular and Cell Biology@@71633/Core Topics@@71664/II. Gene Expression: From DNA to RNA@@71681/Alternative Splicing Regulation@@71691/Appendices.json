[@problem_id:2932024]", "problem": "A research group is quantifying alternative splicing regulation in a mammalian gene using high-depth RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). They assume that, for junction-spanning reads, the expected read count mapping to a junction is proportional to the abundance of the isoform that contains that junction multiplied by the junction’s effective mappable length, and that effective mappable lengths are equal for all competing junctions within a given event. They also assume steady state, so that read counts reflect relative mature isoform abundances. The group seeks to compute the percent spliced in (PSI) for two event types from junction read counts.\n\nEvent 1 (cassette exon): Exon $A$ is optionally included between constitutive exons $C1$ and $C2$. Junction-spanning reads were counted as follows: $C1$–$A$: $87$; $A$–$C2$: $101$; $C1$–$C2$ (exon-skipping junction): $56$.\n\nEvent 2 (alternative $3'$ splice site): Two alternative acceptor sites ($A_{\\text{proximal}}$ and $A_{\\text{distal}}$) compete for the same donor, producing two mutually exclusive junctions that differ by the length of the included segment. Reads supporting the junction that yields the longer included exon segment (“long” junction) were $173$; reads supporting the junction that yields the shorter included exon segment (“short” junction) were $139$.\n\nStarting from the definition that percent spliced in (PSI) is the fraction of mature transcripts that include the regulated exon or, for alternative $5'$ or $3'$ splice site events, the fraction that use the junction corresponding to the longer exon form, derive expressions that estimate PSI from the available junction counts under the assumptions stated.

It describes a standard bioinformatics task of quantifying alternative splicing from RNA sequencing data. The assumptions provided—proportionality between read counts and isoform abundance, equal effective mappable lengths for competing junctions, and steady-state transcript levels—are common and necessary simplifications for such calculations. All required data are provided, and the problem is free of contradictions or ambiguities. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle, derived from the problem's assumptions, is that the number of junction-spanning reads can be used as a direct, proportional measure of the abundance of the corresponding mature messenger RNA (mRNA) isoform. Let $N_k$ be the abundance of an isoform $k$, and let $R(J)$ be the read count for a junction $J$ present in that isoform. The problem states $R(J) \\propto N_k \\times L_{\\text{eff}}(J)$, where $L_{\\text{eff}}(J)$ is the effective mappable length of the junction. By the assumption that $L_{\\text{eff}}(J)$ is constant for all competing junctions in an event, this simplifies to $R(J) \\propto N_k$. Therefore, we can use normalized read counts as direct estimates of relative isoform abundances.\n\nThe percent spliced in (PSI, denoted as $\\Psi$) is defined as the fractional abundance of the \"inclusion\" isoform relative to the total abundance of all competing isoforms from a given splicing event.\n$$\n\\Psi = \\frac{N_{\\text{inclusion}}}{N_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{inclusion}}}{N_{\\text{inclusion}} + N_{\\text{exclusion}}}\n$$\nUsing read counts as a proxy for isoform abundance, we can estimate $\\Psi$.\n\nEvent $1$: Cassette Exon\n\nIn this event, there are two competing isoforms:\n$1$. The \"inclusion\" isoform, which contains the exon cassette $A$ and has the structure $C_1-A-C_2$.\n$2$. The \"skipping\" or \"exclusion\" isoform, which omits exon $A$ and has the structure $C_1-C_2$.\n\nThe inclusion isoform is uniquely identified by the presence of two distinct splice junctions: the junction from exon $C_1$ to exon $A$ ($J_{C_1-A}$) and the junction from exon $A$ to exon $C_2$ ($J_{A-C_2}$). The read counts for these junctions are given as $R(J_{C_1-A}) = 87$ and $R(J_{A-C_2}) = 101$. These two counts represent independent measurements of the abundance of the same inclusion isoform. To obtain a robust estimate for the abundance of the inclusion isoform, $N_{\\text{incl}}$, we must average the evidence from all junctions that uniquely support it. This averaging procedure reduces the impact of stochastic noise inherent in the sequencing and read mapping processes. The number of junctions supporting this isoform is $n_{\\text{incl}} = 2$.\n\nThe effective read count representing the inclusion isoform's abundance is therefore the average of the counts from its supporting junctions:\n$$\nR_{\\text{incl}} = \\frac{R(J_{C_1-A}) + R(J_{A-C_2})}{n_{\\text{incl}}} = \\frac{87 + 101}{2} = \\frac{188}{2} = 94\n$$\nThe skipping isoform is uniquely identified by one splice junction: the junction from exon $C_1$ directly to exon $C_2$ ($J_{C_1-C_2}$). The read count for this junction is given as $R(J_{C_1-C_2}) = 56$. The number of junctions supporting this isoform is $n_{\\text{skip}} = 1$. The effective read count for the skipping isoform's abundance, $N_{\\text{skip}}$, is thus:\n$$\nR_{\\text{skip}} = \\frac{R(J_{C_1-C_2})}{n_{\\text{skip}}} = \\frac{56}{1} = 56\n$$\nThe PSI for Event $1$, $\\Psi_1$, is the ratio of the inclusion abundance to the total abundance:\n$$\n\\Psi_1 = \\frac{R_{\\text{incl}}}{R_{\\text{incl}} + R_{\\text{skip}}} = \\frac{94}{94 + 56} = \\frac{94}{150} = 0.62666...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\Psi_1 \\approx 0.6267$.\n\nEvent $2$: Alternative $3'$ Splice Site\n\nIn this event, two mutually exclusive junctions are formed, resulting in two isoforms: one with a longer exon segment and one with a shorter exon segment. Each isoform is uniquely defined by a single junction.\nThe read count supporting the \"long\" isoform is $R_{\\text{long}} = 173$.\nThe read count supporting the \"short\" isoform is $R_{\\text{short}} = 139$.\n\nThe problem defines PSI for this event type as the fraction of transcripts that use the junction corresponding to the longer exon form. No averaging is required here as each isoform is supported by only one unique junction category. The PSI for Event $2$, $\\Psi_2$, is calculated directly from the given counts:\n$$\n\\Psi_2 = \\frac{R_{\\text{long}}}{R_{\\text{long}} + R_{\\text{short}}} = \\frac{173}{173 + 139} = \\frac{173}{312} = 0.554487...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\Psi_2 \\approx 0.5545$.\n\nThe final results for the two events are $\\Psi_1 \\approx 0.6267$ and $\\Psi_2 \\approx 0.5545$.

It is a standard application of a biophysical-statistical model used in genomics.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the expected inclusion probability for a sequence containing a single-nucleotide variant. This requires two main steps: first, to calculate the new total log-odds score for the variant sequence, $S_{\\text{var}}$; second, to use this new score in the provided logistic splicing model to find the probability.\n\nAccording to the problem description, the total score $S$ is an additive sum of position-specific weights. The wild-type score, $S_{\\text{wt}}$, is given as $S_{\\text{wt}} = 5.6$. This score includes the contribution from the wild-type nucleotide at position $+5$, which is $\\text{G}$. The weight for this nucleotide is $w(+5, \\text{G}) = 0.9$.\n\nA single-nucleotide variant changes the nucleotide at position $+5$ from $\\text{G}$ to $\\text{A}$. The problem states that such a variant perturbs only the weight at its position. Therefore, the new score, $S_{\\text{var}}$, can be calculated by starting with the wild-type score, subtracting the weight of the original nucleotide at the altered position, and adding the weight of the new nucleotide at that same position.\n\nThe change in score, $\\Delta S$, is the difference between the variant nucleotide weight and the wild-type nucleotide weight at position $+5$:\n$$\n\\Delta S = w(+5, \\text{A}) - w(+5, \\text{G})\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\Delta S = -0.7 - 0.9 = -1.6\n$$\nThe score for the variant sequence, $S_{\\text{var}}$, is then:\n$$\nS_{\\text{var}} = S_{\\text{wt}} + \\Delta S = S_{\\text{wt}} + (w(+5, \\text{A}) - w(+5, \\text{G}))\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\nS_{\\text{var}} = 5.6 + (-0.7 - 0.9) = 5.6 - 1.6 = 4.0\n$$\nSo, the total log-odds score for the variant sequence is $S_{\\text{var}} = 4.0$.\n\nNext, we use this score in the logistic splicing model to calculate the expected inclusion probability, $P(\\text{include} \\mid S_{\\text{var}})$.
