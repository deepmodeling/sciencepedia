Consider a promoter mutation from TATA to TACA that disrupts exactly one base-specific direct hydrogen bond between TBP and DNA.

The binding free energy, $\\Delta G$, is the sum of contributions from independent interaction terms.\n3.  The only term altered by the mutation is the loss of the single hydrogen bond.\n4.

Standard temperature is $T=298$ K.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular biophysics and thermodynamics. The model of additive free energy contributions is a standard and useful approximation. The energy value cited for a hydrogen bond is physically realistic. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. The standard temperature $T=298$ K is provided but is not necessary for the calculation, as the free energy contribution is given directly, not as separate enthalpic and entropic components. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nWe proceed with the solution based on the provided thermodynamic model. The total binding free energy, $\\Delta G$, for any complex is the sum of individual contributions. Let us denote the free energy contribution from the specific hydrogen bond in question as $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H-bond}}$ and the sum of all other contributions (other base contacts, electrostatics, DNA bending, solvent effects, etc.) as $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{other}}$.\n\nThe binding free energy for the wild-type (wt) complex, where the hydrogen bond is intact, is given by the sum:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{wt}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H-bond}} + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{other}} $$\nThe problem states that the hydrogen bond contributes a \"favorable\" free energy of $1.5$ kcal/mol. In chemical thermodynamics, a favorable process is spontaneous and corresponds to a negative change in Gibbs free energy ($\\Delta G  0$). Therefore, the value of this contribution is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H-bond}} = -1.5 \\text{ kcal/mol} $$\nThe mutation from TATA to TACA disrupts this bond. The problem explicitly states that this is the sole energetic consequence of the mutation. Thus, for the mutant (mut) complex, the contribution from this hydrogen bond is lost (becomes zero), while all other contributions remain unchanged. The binding free energy for the mutant complex is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mut}} = (0) + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{other}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{other}} $$\nWe are asked to calculate the change in binding free energy, $\\Delta\\Delta G$, defined as:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G \\equiv \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mut}} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{wt}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mut}}$ and $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{wt}}$:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G = (\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{other}}) - (\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H-bond}} + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{other}}) $$\nSimplifying the expression, the $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{other}}$ term cancels out:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{other}} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H-bond}} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{other}} = - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H-bond}} $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical value for $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H-bond}}$:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G = -(-1.5 \\text{ kcal/mol}) = +1.5 \\text{ kcal/mol} $$\nThe positive sign of $\\Delta\\Delta G$ indicates that the mutation makes binding less favorable (i.e., it weakens the interaction), which is the expected outcome when a favorable interaction such as a hydrogen bond is lost. The magnitude of this destabilization is precisely the magnitude of the free energy contribution of the lost bond.\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in kcal/mol and rounded to three significant figures. The value $1.5$ has two significant figures.

The promoter initiates with guanosine triphosphate (GTP), and only the initiating Nucleoside Triphosphate (iNTP) concentration, $[{\\rm GTP}]$, is varied; adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for TFIIH-dependent activities and the other ribonucleoside triphosphates (ATP, cytidine triphosphate, uridine triphosphate) for elongation are maintained at saturating concentrations.\n\nConsider a minimal kinetic-partitioning model for the earliest stages of initiation: after open complex formation, the initial transcribing complex (ITC) at transcript length $n$ can either:\n- advance by one nucleotide with pseudo-first-order rate $k_n([{\\rm NTP}_n])$, or\n- undergo abortive release of the nascent RNA with rate $k_{\\rm abort}$, which returns the complex to an earlier scrunched or pre-translocated state without dissociating the PIC.\n\nPromoter escape is operationally defined as reaching a transcript length $n^\\ast$ at which the Pol II active center has displaced the TFIIB B-reader and cleared the promoter, after which the escape step occurs with rate $k_{\\rm esc} \\gg k_{\\rm abort}$ and productive elongation ensues. For this promoter, $n^\\ast \\approx 10$. The following are empirically supported and may be assumed:\n- For $n=1$ (formation of the initial dinucleotide), $k_1([{\\rm GTP}])$ follows Michaelisâ€“Menten dependence on $[{\\rm GTP}]$: $k_1([{\\rm GTP}]) = k_{\\rm cat}\\,[{\\rm GTP}]/(K_M + [{\\rm GTP}])$ with $k_{\\rm cat} = 20\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}$ and $K_M = 50\\,\\mu{\\rm M}$.\n- For $2 \\le n \\le n^\\ast$, all required Nucleoside Triphosphates (NTPs) other than the iNTP are saturating, so $k_n \\approx k_0 = 40\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}$ and is independent of $[{\\rm GTP}]$.\n- The abortive release rate is approximately concentration-independent over the tested range: $k_{\\rm abort} \\approx 1\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}$.\n\nUsing the principle of kinetic partitioning between competing exits from each intermediate, choose the statement that best explains why lowering $[{\\rm GTP}]$ increases abortive initiation and reduces promoter escape efficiency in this system.\n\nA.

Lowering $[{\\rm GTP}]$ does not alter early elongation kinetics because promoter escape is rate-limited solely by Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) phosphorylation of the Pol II C-terminal domain, which depends on ATP rather than GTP; thus abortive initiation is unchanged whereas escape efficiency may decrease only if ATP is reduced.\n\nD.

The general transcription factors listed are the correct ones for PIC assembly on a TATA-box promoter. The phenomenon of abortive initiation and the role of TFIIB in promoter escape are central, factually correct concepts in the field. The provided kinetic model is a plausible and common simplification used to analyze such processes. The rate constants and Michaelis-Menten parameters are within physically realistic orders of magnitude for enzymatic reactions of this type. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary information provided to answer the question based on the model. There are no scientific or logical contradictions. The language is precise and objective.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived based on the provided model.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe problem asks for an explanation of an observation based on a specific kinetic model. The model describes a competition at each step of initial transcription between two mutually exclusive fates for the ITC: successful advancement (synthesis of the next phosphodiester bond) or abortive release of the nascent transcript.\n\nThe probability, $P_{\\rm adv}(n)$, that a complex with a transcript of length $n$ will advance to length $n+1$ rather than abort is determined by the ratio of the forward rate to the sum of the rates of all possible exits from that state. This is the principle of kinetic partitioning.\n$$ P_{\\rm adv}(n) = \\frac{k_n}{k_n + k_{\\rm abort}} $$\nThe probability of aborting at step $n$ is therefore $P_{\\rm abort}(n) = 1 - P_{\\rm adv}(n) = \\frac{k_{\\rm abort}}{k_n + k_{\\rm abort}}$.\n\nPromoter escape is defined as reaching a transcript length of $n^\\ast \\approx 10$. To achieve this, the complex must successfully advance through all preceding steps, from $n=1$ to $n=n^\\ast-1$. The overall probability of reaching the escape-committed state at $n^\\ast$ is the promoter escape efficiency, $\\Phi_{\\rm esc}$. It is the product of the individual advancement probabilities at each step:\n$$ \\Phi_{\\rm esc} = \\prod_{n=1}^{n^\\ast-1} P_{\\rm adv}(n) = \\prod_{n=1}^{n^\\ast-1} \\frac{k_n}{k_n + k_{\\rm abort}} $$\nOnce the complex reaches length $n^\\ast$, the escape rate $k_{\\rm esc}$ is much greater than the abortive rate $k_{\\rm abort}$, so the probability of escape from this state is $\\frac{k_{\\rm esc}}{k_{\\rm esc} + k_{\\rm abort}} \\approx 1$. Thus, the efficiency is dominated by the probability of reaching $n^\\ast$.\n\nWe are given the dependencies of the rates on $[{\\rm GTP}]$:\n1. The rate of the first step, $k_1$, is dependent on $[{\\rm GTP}]$:\n$$ k_1([{\\rm GTP}]) = \\frac{k_{\\rm cat}\\,[{\\rm GTP}]}{K_M + [{\\rm GTP}]} = \\frac{(20\\,{\\rm s}^{-1})\\,[{\\rm GTP}]}{(50\\,\\mu{\\rm M}) + [{\\rm GTP}]} $$\nIt is clear that as $[{\\rm GTP}]$ decreases, the value of $k_1([{\\rm GTP}])$ also decreases.\n2. The rates of subsequent steps, $k_n$ for $n \\geq 2$, are constant: $k_n \\approx k_0 = 40\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}$. This is because the other NTPs are at saturating concentrations.\n3. The rate of abortive release, $k_{\\rm abort} \\approx 1\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}$, is constant and independent of $[{\\rm GTP}]$.\n\nLet us substitute these into the expression for promoter escape efficiency:\n$$ \\Phi_{\\rm esc} = \\left( \\frac{k_1([{\\rm GTP}])}{k_1([{\\rm GTP}]) + k_{\\rm abort}} \\right) \\times \\prod_{n=2}^{n^\\ast-1} \\left( \\frac{k_n}{k_n + k_{\\rm abort}} \\right) $$\n$$ \\Phi_{\\rm esc} = \\left( \\frac{k_1([{\\rm GTP}])}{k_1([{\\rm GTP}]) + 1\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{40\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}}{40\\,{\\rm s}^{-1} + 1\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}} \\right)^{n^\\ast-2} $$\nThe second term, $\\left( \\frac{40}{41} \\right)^{n^\\ast-2}$, is a constant factor. The entire dependence of $\\Phi_{\\rm esc}$ on $[{\\rm GTP}]$ is contained within the first term, which represents the probability of successfully completing the first catalytic step.\n\nWhen $[{\\rm GTP}]$ is lowered, $k_1([{\\rm GTP}])$ decreases. Since $k_{\\rm abort}$ is a constant positive value, the denominator $k_1([{\\rm GTP}]) + k_{\\rm abort}$ decreases less than the numerator $k_1([{\\rm GTP}])$. Consequently, the ratio $\\frac{k_1([{\\rm GTP}])}{k_1([{\\rm GTP}]) + k_{\\rm abort}}$ decreases. This reduces the overall product, $\\Phi_{\\rm esc}$.\n\nThe total probability of abortive initiation is the probability that the complex fails to reach $n^\\ast$, which is $1 - \\Phi_{\\rm esc}$. Since lowering $[{\\rm GTP}]$ decreases $\\Phi_{\\rm esc}$, it must reciprocally increase the total probability of abortive initiation. The system becomes \"stuck\" at the first step for a longer average time, increasing the opportunity for the competing, constant-rate abortive pathway to occur. This shifts the kinetic partition at the first step towards abortion, which reduces the downstream flux of complexes that can proceed to promoter escape.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Lowering $[{\\rm GTP}]$ decreases $k_1([{\\rm GTP}])$, so the probability to advance past each abort-susceptible early state, approximately $\\prod_{n=1}^{n^\\ast} \\left(k_n / (k_n + k_{\\rm abort})\\right)$, is reduced; because $k_{\\rm abort}$ is relatively $[{\\rm GTP}]$-independent while $k_1$ decreases with $[{\\rm GTP}]$, the balance shifts toward abortive release, lowering the overall probability of reaching $n^\\ast$ and thus promoter escape.**\n- This statement correctly identifies that lowering $[{\\rm GTP}]$ reduces $k_1$. It correctly states the formula for the overall success probability as a product of single-step probabilities. It correctly notes that because only one term in the product ($k_1$-dependent term) decreases, the overall product decreases. The core reasoningâ€”that the balance between a variable forward rate ($k_1$) and a constant competing rate ($k_{\\rm abort}$) is shifted towards the latter when the substrate for the former is limitedâ€”is precisely the conclusion from our derivation. The statement is fully consistent with the provided model.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Lowering $[{\\rm GTP}]$ increases $k_{\\rm abort}$ by forcing reversal of TFIIH-dependent helicase activity, thereby enhancing abortive initiation, but promoter escape remains largely unaffected because $k_{\\rm esc}$ is determined only by proteinâ€“protein interactions.**\n- The claim that lowering $[{\\rm GTP}]$ increases $k_{\\rm abort}$ directly contradicts the given information that $k_{\\rm abort}$ is \"approximately concentration-independent\". The proposed mechanism involving TFIIH helicase reversal is speculative and not supported by the problem statement, which indicates ATP, not GTP, is the fuel for TFIIH. The conclusion that promoter escape is \"largely unaffected\" is incorrect, as our derivation shows a clear dependence of $\\Phi_{\\rm esc}$ on $[{\\rm GTP}]$.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Lowering $[{\\rm GTP}]$ does not alter early elongation kinetics because promoter escape is rate-limited solely by Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) phosphorylation of the Pol II C-terminal domain, which depends on ATP rather than GTP; thus abortive initiation is unchanged whereas escape efficiency may decrease only if ATP is reduced.**\n- The statement that lowering $[{\\rm GTP}]$ does not alter early elongation kinetics is false. The rate of the very first step, $k_1$, is part of the early elongation kinetics and is explicitly dependent on $[{\\rm GTP}]$. The assertion that escape is rate-limited *solely* by CDK7 phosphorylation introduces a mechanism outside the provided kinetic model. The question must be answered using the given model, which shows a rate limitation at the first nucleotide addition step when $[{\\rm GTP}]$ is low. Consequently, the claim that abortive initiation is unchanged is also false.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Lowering $[{\\rm GTP}]$ saturates the active site with initiating nucleotide and causes product inhibition at the first bond formation step, increasing the dwell time in a paused state that yields abortive transcripts, without changing the partitioning probabilities.**\n- The premise that lowering $[{\\rm GTP}]$ *saturates* the active site is a fundamental error in enzyme kinetics; saturation occurs at high substrate concentrations, not low ones. The concept of product inhibition is introduced without basis from the problem statement. Most critically, the claim that this occurs \"without changing the partitioning probabilities\" is false. The entire mechanism relies on the fact that the partitioning probability at the first step, $P_{\\rm adv}(1) = k_1 / (k_1 + k_{\\rm abort})$, *does* change as a function of $[{\\rm GTP}]$.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2946699"}, {"introduction": "Regulating gene expression often involves controlling the activity of RNA Polymerase II after it has initiated transcription.

This yields a simplified expression for the fold-change that depends only on the read counts in the specified regions:\n$$ F = \\frac{T_{p}/T_{b}}{C_{p}/C_{b}} = \\frac{T_{p}}{T_{b}} \\cdot \\frac{C_{b}}{C_{p}} $$\n\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n$C_{p} = 1650$\n$C_{b} = 7350$\n$T_{p} = 2700$\n$T_{b} = 5400$\n\n$$ F = \\frac{2700}{5400} \\cdot \\frac{7350}{1650} $$\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\nThe first fraction simplifies to $\\frac{2700}{5400} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe second fraction simplifies as $\\frac{7350}{1650} = \\frac{735}{165}$. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by $15$: $735 = 15 \\times 49$ and $165 = 15 \\times 11$.\nSo, $\\frac{735}{165} = \\frac{49}{11}$.\n\nTherefore, the fold-change is:\n$$ F = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{49}{11} = \\frac{49}{22} $$\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we perform the division:\n$$ F = 2.2272727... $$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $2.227$. The fifth digit is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., truncate).\nThe final numerical value is $2.227$. This value, being greater than $1$, indicates an increase in the pause index upon treatment, consistent with a mechanism that enhances promoter-proximal pausing relative to productive elongation. This is qualitatively supported by the increase in normalized NELF ChIP-seq signal from treatment.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{2.227} $$", "id": "2946638"}]}
