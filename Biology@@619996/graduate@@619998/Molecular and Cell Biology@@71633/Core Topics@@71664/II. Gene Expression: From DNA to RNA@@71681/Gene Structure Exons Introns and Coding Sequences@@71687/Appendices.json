It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, and well-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe task is to predict the molecular consequences of the $+1$ $\\text{G}\\to\\text{A}$ mutation at the canonical $5'$ splice donor site of intron $3$.\n\n1.  **Effect on the Canonical Splice Site**: The mutation changes the sequence at the exon-intron junction from C A G|**G** U A A G U to C A G|**A** U A A G U. According to Fact (i), recognition of the $5'$ splice site is initiated by base-pairing with the U1 snRNA, and there is a \"near-invariant requirement\" for a guanine ($\\text{G}$) at the $+1$ position. The $5'$ end of U1 snRNA, which performs this recognition, has a consensus sequence $5'$-A U A C C U U...$3'$. It pairs with the splice donor site as follows in the wild-type case:\n    $$\n    \\text{pre-mRNA} \\quad 5' \\quad \\dots \\text{A G} | \\mathbf{G U A A G U} \\quad \\dots \\quad 3' \\\\\n    \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\quad || |.| || \\\\\n    \\text{U1 snRNA} \\quad 3' \\quad \\dots \\text{U C C A U A} \\quad \\dots \\quad 5'\n    $$\n    The crucial $\\text{G}$ at $+1$ forms a canonical Watson-Crick base pair with a cytosine ($\\text{C}$) in the U1 snRNA. The mutation to adenine ($\\text{A}$) at $+1$ would create an A-C mismatch, which severely destabilizes the U1 snRNA:pre-mRNA duplex. This effectively abolishes productive U1 snRNP binding at the canonical donor site.\n\n2.  **Evaluation of Alternative (Cryptic) Splice Sites**: With the canonical site inactivated, the splicing machinery will scan the local sequence for alternative sites that can be recognized by U1 snRNP. The problem presents two such sites:\n    -   **Exonic Cryptic Donor at $-8$**: Sequence is $5'$-C A G|G U G A G U-$3'$. This site contains the essential $\\text{GU}$ dinucleotide at its potential $+1$ and $+2$ positions, making it recognizable by U1 snRNP. Critically, it is flanked by ESEs that recruit SR proteins. According to Fact (ii), SR proteins *stabilize* U1 snRNP recruitment. This site is therefore not only a potential substrate but is also actively promoted.\n    -   **Intronic Cryptic Donor at $+15$**: Sequence is $5'$-C A G|G U U A C U-$3'$. This site also contains the essential $\\text{GU}$ dinucleotide. However, it is overlapped by a splicing silencer motif bound by hnRNP A1. According to Fact (ii), hnRNP A1 *antagonizes* U1 snRNP recruitment. This site is therefore actively repressed.\n\n3.  **Selection of the Most Likely Splice Site**: Comparing the two cryptic sites, the exonic donor at $-8$ is strongly favored. It has the correct core sequence and is located in a context of positive regulation (enhancers). The intronic donor at $+15$, despite having the core sequence, is in a context of negative regulation (silencers). Therefore, the splicing machinery is most likely to select the cryptic donor at $-8$.\n\n4.  **Consequences on mRNA and Protein**: Splicing at the $-8$ cryptic site means the cut is made $8$ nucleotides upstream of the original exon-intron boundary. These $8$ nucleotides, which belong to exon $3$ in the wild-type transcript, are now treated as part of the intron and are removed. The resulting mature mRNA will have an exon $3$ that is shortened by $8$ nucleotides at its $3'$ end.\n    A deletion of $8$ nucleotides is not a multiple of $3$ ($8 \\pmod 3 = 2$). This will cause a frameshift in the translation of the mRNA downstream of the mutation. A frameshift almost invariably leads to the creation of a premature termination codon (PTC). An mRNA containing a PTC is recognized by the cell's surveillance machinery and targeted for degradation via the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The $+1$ $\\text{G}\\to\\text{A}$ substitution abolishes productive U1 snRNP pairing at the canonical donor, shifting initial recognition to the exonic cryptic donor at $-8$ (C A G|G U G A G U), whose $\\text{GU}$ at $+1,+2$ and flanking ESE-bound SR proteins favor its selection. The mRNA will lack the last $8$ nucleotides of exon $3$, inducing a frameshift and likely nonsense-mediated decay.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with our derivation. It correctly identifies the inactivation of the canonical site, the selection of the enhanced exonic cryptic site over the repressed intronic one, the resulting deletion of $8$ nucleotides from exon $3$, and the downstream consequences of a frameshift and NMD.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. U1 snRNP can maintain binding at the canonical donor via a tolerated wobble at $+1$ (A–U), so splicing proceeds largely normally with only minor efficiency loss; cryptic donors are not activated, and the coding sequence remains unchanged.**\nThis is incorrect. The pairing at position $+1$ is with a cytosine in U1 snRNA, not a uracil. The resulting A-C mismatch is not a wobble pair and is highly disruptive. The problem explicitly states a \"near-invariant requirement for $\\text{G}$ at $+1$,\" contradicting the idea that an A would be tolerated. Splicing will be severely impaired, not proceed normally.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The mutation increases U1 snRNP affinity for the intronic cryptic donor at $+15$ due to its proximity to the $5'$ cap, promoting selection of the intronic cryptic donor and yielding partial intron retention in the mRNA.**\nThis is incorrect. First, proximity to the $5'$ cap is not a primary factor for splice site choice in this context. Second, and more importantly, the intronic cryptic site is bound by the repressor protein hnRNP A1, which *antagonizes* U1 snRNP binding. Its selection is therefore highly unlikely.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Because exon definition requires an intact donor, the spliceosome bypasses exon $3$ entirely, causing exon $3$ skipping as the dominant outcome rather than activating any nearby cryptic donors, leading to an in-frame exon skip if exon $3$ length is divisible by $3$.**\nWhile exon skipping is a possible outcome of splice site mutations, it is not the *most likely* outcome when a strong, positively regulated cryptic splice site is available, as is the case here with the site at $-8$. The problem is constructed to highlight the competition between cryptic sites. The presence of an ESE-flanked cryptic donor makes its activation a more probable event than complete exon skipping. The option's claim that cryptic donors are not activated is a strong assertion that contradicts the provided information.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) compensates for impaired U1 snRNP recognition at an early stage, restoring normal use of the canonical donor; splicing and coding sequence remain unchanged.**\nThis misrepresents the temporal order of spliceosome assembly. U1 snRNP carries out the initial recognition of the $5'$ splice site. U6 snRNA is a component of the catalytic core that acts much later in the process, after U1 has bound and been subsequently displaced. U6 cannot \"compensate\" for a failure in the initial U1 binding step. If U1 does not bind, the pathway is aborted at that site before U6 becomes involved.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2946319"}, {"introduction": "While we learn simple consensus sequences for splice sites, the reality is more nuanced; some sites are 'stronger' than others based on how well they match an ideal pattern.

A positive score indicates the sequence is a better match for the PWM than for the background. A score of $0$ indicates no preference, and a negative score indicates the sequence is more likely to arise from the background. The magnitude indicates the strength of the evidence.\n\nA score of $11.34$ bits is a large positive value. It means the sequence is approximately $2^{11.34} \\approx 2600$ times more likely to be generated by the PWM model than the background model. Every nucleotide in the candidate sequence contributes a positive score, meaning each is more probable in a true site (according to this model) than in the background. The most conserved and critical positions for a $5^{\\prime}$ donor site are the almost invariant GT dinucleotide at positions $+1$ and $+2$. The candidate sequence contains G and T at these positions, and they provide the largest contributions to the score ($2.29$ bits and $1.71$ bits, respectively). The high probability of G at position $-1$ in the PWM ($p_{3,G}=0.70$) is also matched by the sequence, yielding another large contribution ($1.81$ bits). Therefore, the score of $11.34$ bits indicates a relatively strong $5^{\\prime}$ splice site. It strongly conforms to the sequence pattern captured by the PWM.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{11.34}$$", "id": "2946389"}]}
