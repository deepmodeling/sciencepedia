It is a standard exercise in quantitative molecular biology, applying fundamental principles of enzyme kinetics to the process of transcription. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe core principle is that the overall steady-state elongation rate, which we shall denote as $v_{\\text{avg}}$, is the reciprocal of the average time required to incorporate a single nucleotide, $\\langle t_{\\text{incorp}} \\rangle$.\n$$v_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{\\langle t_{\\text{incorp}} \\rangle}$$\nThe transcript is composed of four types of nucleotides. The problem simplifies this by considering two classes of incorporation events: those involving adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and those involving the other three ribonucleoside triphosphates (NTPs: CTP, GTP, UTP), which we will group as 'other'. The average incorporation time is therefore a weighted average of the time taken for an ATP incorporation, $t_{\\text{ATP}}$, and the time for any other NTP incorporation, $t_{\\text{other}}$. The weights are the respective frequencies of occurrence on the template. We are given the fraction of incorporations requiring ATP as $f_{\\text{ATP}} = 0.25$. The fraction requiring other NTPs is $1 - f_{\\text{ATP}} = 0.75$.\n\nThus, the average incorporation time is:\n$$\\langle t_{\\text{incorp}} \\rangle = f_{\\text{ATP}} \\cdot t_{\\text{ATP}} + (1 - f_{\\text{ATP}}) \\cdot t_{\\text{other}}$$\nThe time for a single incorporation event is the reciprocal of the incorporation velocity for that specific NTP.\n$$t_{\\text{incorp}} = \\frac{1}{v_{\\text{incorp}}}$$\nThe velocity of incorporation, $v$, for a given substrate (NTP) follows Michaelis–Menten kinetics:\n$$v = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}} [\\text{S}]}{K_m + [\\text{S}]}$$\nwhere $k_{\\text{cat}}$ is the catalytic constant (the maximal turnover rate), $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant, and $[\\text{S}]$ is the substrate concentration.\n\nFirst, we calculate the incorporation velocity for ATP, $v_{\\text{ATP}}$.

The problem states they are at \"saturating concentrations\", under which conditions their incorporation proceeds at the \"maximal turnover rate\". The maximal turnover rate is, by definition, $k_{\\text{cat}}$. Therefore, the incorporation velocity for these other NTPs, $v_{\\text{other}}$, is equal to $k_{\\text{cat}}$.\n$$v_{\\text{other}} = k_{\\text{cat}} = 50\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$$\nThe time required for a single non-ATP incorporation is:\n$$t_{\\text{other}} = \\frac{1}{v_{\\text{other}}} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{cat}}} = \\frac{1}{50}\\,\\text{s}$$\nNow, we can compute the average incorporation time $\\langle t_{\\text{incorp}} \\rangle$ using the given frequency $f_{\\text{ATP}} = 0.25$.\n$$\\langle t_{\\text{incorp}} \\rangle = (0.25) \\cdot t_{\\text{ATP}} + (1 - 0.25) \\cdot t_{\\text{other}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{11}{500}\\,\\text{s}\\right) + \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{50}\\,\\text{s}\\right)$$\nTo combine these terms, we find a common denominator.\n$$\\langle t_{\\text{incorp}} \\rangle = \\frac{11}{2000}\\,\\text{s} + \\frac{3}{200}\\,\\text{s} = \\frac{11}{2000}\\,\\text{s} + \\frac{30}{2000}\\,\\text{s} = \\frac{41}{2000}\\,\\text{s}$$\nThe expected steady-state elongation rate, $v_{\\text{avg}}$, is the reciprocal of this average time.\n$$v_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{\\langle t_{\\text{incorp}} \\rangle} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{41}{2000}\\,\\text{s}} = \\frac{2000}{41}\\,\\text{nt}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$$\nNumerically, this is approximately $48.78048...\\,\\text{nt}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.
