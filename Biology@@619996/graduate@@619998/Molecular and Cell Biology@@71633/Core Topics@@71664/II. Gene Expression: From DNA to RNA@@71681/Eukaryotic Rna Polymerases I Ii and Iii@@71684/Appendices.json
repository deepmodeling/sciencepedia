It is scientifically grounded, employing a standard kinetic model for enzymatic processes (specifically, a simplified model of transcription elongation). The premises are objective, the language is precise, and the problem is well-posed, containing all necessary information for a unique solution. It does not violate any principles of physics, chemistry, or mathematics.\n\nWe begin the derivation. The problem states that each step corresponds to a Poisson process with a given rate constant. For a process with rate constant $k$, the waiting time $T$ is an exponentially distributed random variable with probability density function $p(t) = k \\exp(-kt)$. The mean of this distribution, representing the average waiting time for the step to complete, is the reciprocal of the rate constant.\n\nLet $T_{\\text{chem}}$ be the waiting time for the chemical step and $T_{\\text{trans}}$ be the waiting time for the translocation step. Their respective mean values are:\n$$\n\\langle T_{\\text{chem}} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{chem}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\langle T_{\\text{trans}} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{trans}}}\n$$\nThe total time to complete one full cycle, $T_{\\text{cycle}}$, is the sum of the times for the two sequential steps, as they must occur in order: $T_{\\text{cycle}} = T_{\\text{chem}} + T_{\\text{trans}}$.\n\nDue to the linearity of expectation, the mean of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual means. Since the steps are independent, this property holds directly. Therefore, the mean time for one full cycle is:\n$$\n\\langle T_{\\text{cycle}} \\rangle = \\langle T_{\\text{chem}} \\rangle + \\langle T_{\\text{trans}} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{chem}}} + \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{trans}}}\n$$\nThe problem defines the steady-state elongation rate, $k_{\\text{elong}}$, as the reciprocal of this mean cycle time. This gives the first required result, the functional dependence of $k_{\\text{elong}}$ on $k_{\\text{chem}}$ and $k_{\\text{trans}}$:\n$$\nk_{\\text{elong}} = \\frac{1}{\\langle T_{\\text{cycle}} \\rangle} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{k_{\\text{chem}}} + \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{trans}}}}\n$$\nThis expression can be algebraically simplified to:\n$$\nk_{\\text{elong}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{chem}} k_{\\text{trans}}}{k_{\\text{chem}} + k_{\\text{trans}}}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the overall rate of a two-step sequential process is limited by the slower step, a result analogous to resistors in series in an electrical circuit, where the total resistance is the sum of individual resistances. Here, the mean times, which are reciprocals of rates, are the \"resistances\" to the process flow.\n\nNext, we compute the fold-change in the elongation rate, which is the ratio of the mutant rate to the wild-type rate, $k_{\\text{elong,mut}}/k_{\\text{elong,wt}}$.\nThe wild-type elongation rate, $k_{\\text{elong,wt}}$, using the derived formula is:\n$$\nk_{\\text{elong,wt}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{chem,wt}} k_{\\text{trans,wt}}}{k_{\\text{chem,wt}} + k_{\\text{trans,wt}}}\n$$\nFor the mutant, the rate constants are $k_{\\text{chem,mut}} = k_{\\text{chem,wt}}/5$ and $k_{\\text{trans,mut}} = k_{\\text{trans,wt}}$.

Global Run-On sequencing (GRO-seq) quantifies the density of transcriptionally engaged polymerases, and Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads (RPKM) provides a length- and library-size–normalized measure of read density. The pausing index is a dimensionless quantity that, by definition, compares the density of engaged polymerase within a promoter-proximal window to the density across the gene body.\n\nConsider a single-copy, protein-coding gene in a homogeneous cell population. GRO-seq analysis yields a promoter-proximal read density of $800$ RPKM and a gene body read density of $200$ RPKM, where the promoter-proximal region and the gene body have been defined according to standard practice so that RPKM normalization already accounts for region lengths.\n\nStarting from the core definitions above (transcription by Pol II, GRO-seq as a measure of engaged polymerase density, and pausing index as a dimensionless ratio comparing promoter-proximal to gene body density), derive an expression for the pausing index and compute its value from the data provided.

Provide only this number as your final answer.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the pausing index for a eukaryotic gene and a reasoned analysis of its consistency with regulation by Negative Elongation Factor (NELF). The validation of the problem statement is the mandatory first step.\n\nThe givens are as follows:\n1.  The system is a single-copy, protein-coding gene under transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II).\n2.  The experimental technique is Global Run-On sequencing (GRO-seq), which measures the density of transcriptionally engaged polymerases.\n3.  The unit of measurement is Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads (RPKM).\n4.  The promoter-proximal read density, which we denote as $D_{pp}$, is $D_{pp} = 800$ RPKM.\n5.  The gene body read density, which we denote as $D_{gb}$, is $D_{gb} = 200$ RPKM.\n6.  The pausing index is defined as a dimensionless ratio comparing the polymerase density in the promoter-proximal region to the density across the gene body.\n7.  NELF is stated to be a stabilizer of promoter-proximal pausing.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The concepts of Pol II transcription, promoter-proximal pausing, NELF, GRO-seq, and the pausing index are all fundamental and established principles in molecular biology. The data provided are self-consistent and sufficient for a unique solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be constructed.\n\nThe pausing index, which we will denote as $PI$, is explicitly defined as the ratio of the density of engaged polymerase in the promoter-proximal window to the density across the gene body. Given that GRO-seq RPKM values provide a normalized measure of this density, the expression for the pausing index is a direct formalization of this definition.\n\nLet $D_{pp}$ be the polymerase density in the promoter-proximal region and $D_{gb}$ be the polymerase density in the gene body. The pausing index is then given by the following relation:\n$$\nPI = \\frac{D_{pp}}{D_{gb}}\n$$\nThe problem provides the necessary values for these densities:\n$$\nD_{pp} = 800 \\text{ RPKM}\n$$\n$$\nD_{gb} = 200 \\text{ RPKM}\n$$\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the pausing index, we obtain its numerical value:\n$$\nPI = \\frac{800}{200} = 4\n$$\nAs required, the units of RPKM cancel, rendering the pausing index a dimensionless quantity. A value of $PI > 1$ indicates an accumulation of polymerase in the promoter-proximal region relative to the gene body.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires an assessment of whether this value is consistent with regulation by NELF. Promoter-proximal pausing is a key regulatory checkpoint in eukaryotic gene expression. It involves the stalling of Pol II shortly after transcription initiation, typically $20$ to $60$ nucleotides downstream of the transcription start site. This paused state is stabilized by a complex of factors, with the Negative Elongation Factor (NELF) and DSIF (DRB Sensitivity-Inducing Factor) being central components. For transcription to proceed into productive elongation, the polymerase must be released from this pause, a process often triggered by the phosphorylation of NELF and the Spt5 subunit of DSIF by Positive Transcription Elongation Factor b (P-TEFb).\n\nThe direct consequence of this pausing mechanism is an increased residential time of Pol II in the promoter-proximal region compared to the gene body. A technique like GRO-seq, which captures the positions of transcriptionally engaged polymerases, will therefore detect a higher signal density (more reads) in the promoter-proximal region of a paused gene. The pausing index is the quantitative measure of this phenomenon.\n\nA gene with no significant pausing would exhibit a relatively uniform distribution of Pol II along its length, resulting in a pausing index close to $1$. The calculated pausing index of $4$ indicates that the density of engaged Pol II is four-fold higher near the promoter than it is throughout the rest of the gene. This significant accumulation is a clear signature of strong promoter-proximal pausing. Since the primary, well-established function of NELF is to induce and stabilize this paused state, a pausing index of $4$ is not only consistent with regulation by NELF but is characteristic of a gene whose expression is controlled by this mechanism. A higher pausing index would imply an even stronger or more stable pause, while a lower index (closer to $1$) would suggest weaker pausing or more efficient release into elongation.
