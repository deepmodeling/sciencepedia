In the catalytically activated spliceosome approaching exon ligation (transition from the C* complex to the P complex), the $3'$ splice site dinucleotide is inserted into a recognition pocket within the catalytic core (comprising protein and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) elements) that positions the scissile phosphate for the second transesterification. Consider a minimal structural model of the pocket in which the adenine at the first position of the $3'$ splice site dinucleotide $\\text{AG}$ is specifically recognized by two directional hydrogen bonds: the pocket presents one hydrogen-bond donor positioned to interact with the N1 atom of adenine (N1 of adenine is a hydrogen-bond acceptor) and one hydrogen-bond acceptor positioned to interact with the N6 exocyclic amine of adenine (N6 of adenine is a hydrogen-bond donor). The geometry of this pocket is assumed to be rigid to within $\\pm 0.02\\ \\text{nm}$, such that side-chain or base reorientation beyond this tolerance introduces a steric penalty exceeding typical hydrogen-bond stabilization.

A severe decrease (greater than $10^{2}$-fold) in exon ligation efficiency, because the donor at the pocket’s N1-contact site and the acceptor at the pocket’s N6-contact site become donor–donor and acceptor–acceptor mismatches with guanine, respectively, eliminating both specific hydrogen bonds with no feasible geometric rescue.\n\nB.

Reorientation beyond this limit incurs a steric penalty greater than a typical hydrogen-bond stabilization energy.\n    - The pocket presents two hydrogen-bond partners for adenine:\n        1. A hydrogen-bond donor that interacts with the N1 atom of adenine.\n        2. A hydrogen-bond acceptor that interacts with the N6 exocyclic amine of adenine.\n- **Energetic and Mechanistic Assumptions**:\n    - A specific directional hydrogen bond contributes $\\epsilon \\approx 2.0\\ \\text{kcal}\\cdot \\text{mol}^{-1}$ to binding free energy.\n    - Water-mediated interactions are disfavored by $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{water}} \\geq 1.5\\ \\text{kcal}\\cdot \\text{mol}^{-1}$.\n    - Exon ligation efficiency is proportional to the Boltzmann factor of the docking free energy: Efficiency $\\propto \\exp(-\\Delta G_{\\text{docking}} / k_B T)$.\n- **Point Mutation**: The $3'$ splice site `AG` is mutated to `GG`.\n- **Nucleobase Hydrogen Bonding Properties**:\n    - Adenine (A): N1 is an acceptor; N6 is a donor.\n    - Guanine (G): N1 is a donor; O6 is an acceptor; N2 is a donor.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is analyzed for validity.\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is well-grounded in the principles of molecular and structural biology. It uses established concepts like spliceosome complexes (C*, P), splice site consensus sequences (`AG`), hydrogen bonding patterns of nucleic acids, and a simplified biophysical model based on free energy and the Boltzmann distribution. These are standard and valid tools for reasoning about molecular recognition.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a complete set of assumptions and data—the wild-type interaction geometry, the properties of the mutant base, and the energetic parameters—required to deduce the outcome of the mutation within the defined model.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective, scientific language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It presents a solvable question based on a self-consistent physical model. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\nThe effect of the mutation on exon ligation efficiency is determined by calculating the change in the docking free energy ($\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{docking}}$) and relating it to the efficiency ratio via the Boltzmann factor.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Wild-Type (WT) Interaction**:\n    - The pocket is designed to recognize adenine (A). The H-bond properties of A are: N1 is an acceptor, and the N6 amine is a donor.\n    - The pocket provides: a donor for A's N1, and an acceptor for A's N6.\n    - This results in two specific hydrogen bonds:\n        - Pocket Donor $\\cdots$ N1-Adenine (Acceptor)\n        - Pocket Acceptor $\\cdots$ H-N6-Adenine (Donor)\n    - The total stabilization energy from these two hydrogen bonds in the WT complex is:\n      $$ \\Delta G_{\\text{H-bonds, WT}} = -2 \\times \\epsilon = -2 \\times (2.0\\ \\text{kcal}\\cdot \\text{mol}^{-1}) = -4.0\\ \\text{kcal}\\cdot \\text{mol}^{-1} $$\n    The negative sign indicates a favorable contribution to binding.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Mutant (MUT) Interaction**:\n    - In the mutant, adenine is replaced by guanine (G). The H-bond properties of G are: N1 is a donor, the O6 carbonyl is an acceptor, and the N2 amine is a donor.\n    - The rigid pocket's H-bond partners do not change. We must evaluate the new interactions:\n        - **At position 1 (N1 contact)**: The pocket presents a donor. Guanine's N1 is also a donor. This creates a donor-donor (`D-D`) electronic repulsion, and the hydrogen bond is lost.\n        - **At position 2 (N6/O6 contact)**: The pocket presents an acceptor. Guanine's O6 is also an acceptor. This creates an acceptor-acceptor (`A-A`) electronic repulsion, and this hydrogen bond is also lost.\n    - The problem explicitly states the pocket is rigid and that reorientation to use other groups (like Guanine's N2 donor) is sterically prohibited, incurring a penalty larger than the potential gain from a new H-bond. Therefore, no geometric rescue is possible.\n    - Consequently, both specific hydrogen bonds stabilizing the WT complex are lost in the mutant complex.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Change in Free Energy and Efficiency**:\n    - The free energy change upon mutation, $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{docking}}$, is dominated by the loss of the two hydrogen bonds.\n      $$ \\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{docking}} = \\Delta G_{\\text{docking, MUT}} - \\Delta G_{\\text{docking, WT}} \\approx \\Delta G_{\\text{H-bonds, MUT}} - \\Delta G_{\\text{H-bonds, WT}} $$\n      $$ \\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{docking}} \\approx 0 - (-4.0\\ \\text{kcal}\\cdot \\text{mol}^{-1}) = +4.0\\ \\text{kcal}\\cdot \\text{mol}^{-1} $$\n    - A positive $\\Delta \\Delta G$ indicates that the mutant docking is significantly less stable.\n    - The ratio of efficiencies is given by the ratio of their Boltzmann factors:\n      $$ \\frac{\\text{Efficiency}_{\\text{MUT}}}{\\text{Efficiency}_{\\text{WT}}} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\Delta G_{\\text{MUT}}/RT)}{\\exp(-\\Delta G_{\\text{WT}}/RT)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{docking}}}{RT}\\right) $$\n    - Using the value of the gas constant $R \\approx 1.987 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{kcal}\\cdot \\text{mol}^{-1}\\cdot \\text{K}^{-1}$ and a physiological temperature of $T \\approx 310\\ \\text{K}$ ($37^\\circ\\text{C}$), we have $RT \\approx 0.616\\ \\text{kcal}\\cdot \\text{mol}^{-1}$.\n      $$ \\frac{\\text{Efficiency}_{\\text{MUT}}}{\\text{Efficiency}_{\\text{WT}}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4.0\\ \\text{kcal}\\cdot \\text{mol}^{-1}}{0.616\\ \\text{kcal}\\cdot \\text{mol}^{-1}}\\right) \\approx \\exp(-6.49) \\approx 1.52 \\times 10^{-3} $$\n    - The efficiency decreases by a factor of $1 / (1.52 \\times 10^{-3}) \\approx 658$.\n    - A $658$-fold decrease is a severe decrease, significantly greater than $100$-fold ($10^2$).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. A severe decrease (greater than $10^{2}$-fold) in exon ligation efficiency, because the donor at the pocket’s N1-contact site and the acceptor at the pocket’s N6-contact site become donor–donor and acceptor–acceptor mismatches with guanine, respectively, eliminating both specific hydrogen bonds with no feasible geometric rescue.**\nThis option accurately describes the consequences derived from the problem's premises. The calculated decrease is $\\approx 658$-fold, which is greater than $10^2$-fold. It correctly identifies the donor-donor mismatch at N1 and the acceptor-acceptor mismatch at the O6 position (which replaces A's N6). It correctly concludes that both hydrogen bonds are eliminated and that the pocket's rigidity prevents geometric rescue.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. A modest decrease (approximately $2$–$3$-fold), because guanine’s O6 can substitute for adenine’s N6 to preserve one hydrogen bond while the other is lost, maintaining partial docking.**\nThis is incorrect. Guanine's O6 is a hydrogen-bond acceptor, while adenine's N6 is a donor. The pocket presents an acceptor at this site. An acceptor cannot form a hydrogen bond with another acceptor (O6). Therefore, this hydrogen bond is not preserved; it is lost. A $2$–$3$-fold decrease is also a vast underestimate of the energetic penalty of losing two hydrogen bonds.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. An increase in efficiency, because guanine’s additional N2 exocyclic amine provides an extra hydrogen bond, strengthening docking and accelerating exon ligation.**\nThis is incorrect. An increase in efficiency would require a negative $\\Delta \\Delta G$, but our calculation shows a large positive $\\Delta \\Delta G$. Furthermore, the model explicitly disfavors geometric rearrangement to accommodate new interactions (like with G's N2) due to a prohibitive steric penalty associated with the pocket's rigidity. The pocket is specified to have donors/acceptors only for the A's N1 and N6 atoms.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. No significant change, because the spliceosome’s active site is highly plastic during the C* to P transition and readily reorganizes to accommodate purine–purine isosteres without energetic penalty.**\nThis is incorrect because it directly contradicts a central assumption of the problem: \"The geometry of this pocket is assumed to be rigid... such that side-chain or base reorientation... introduces a steric penalty.\" Within the defined model, the site is not plastic and does not accommodate the mutation without a severe energetic penalty.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$"}, {"introduction": "The assembly of the spliceosome is a dynamic, multi-step process governed by the laws of chemical kinetics and thermodynamics.

This gives $2^3 = 8$ distinct binding states. An additional state, which we denote as $A$, represents the final A complex. The system can thus occupy a total of $9$ discrete states.\n\nThe problem states that all reaction steps are reversible and the system reaches a steady state on a time scale where synthesis and degradation are negligible. Under these conditions, the principle of detailed balance applies. This implies that the steady-state distribution of the system across its microstates is a thermodynamic equilibrium distribution. The probability of finding the system in any given state is proportional to its statistical weight.\n\nLet us define the statistical weight, $w$, of each state relative to the unbound state $(0,0,0)$, for which we set the weight $w_{000} = 1$. The weight of any other state is the ratio of its equilibrium probability to that of the reference state. Due to the stated independence of binding for U1, SF1, and U2AF, the equilibrium for each binding event can be considered separately.

Now, we compute the numerical value.\n$$ \\Delta d \\approx \\frac{6.5}{1.09861} \\ln(1.037037...) $$\n$$ \\Delta d \\approx \\frac{6.5}{1.09861} \\times 0.0363675 $$\n$$ \\Delta d \\approx 5.91635 \\times 0.0363675 \\approx 0.21516 \\text{ cm} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in millimeters (mm), rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ 1 \\text{ cm} = 10 \\text{ mm} $$\nTherefore, the shift in millimeters is:\n$$ \\Delta d_{\\text{mm}} = 0.21516 \\text{ cm} \\times 10 \\frac{\\text{mm}}{\\text{cm}} = 2.1516 \\text{ mm} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $2.15$ mm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.15}$$"}]}
