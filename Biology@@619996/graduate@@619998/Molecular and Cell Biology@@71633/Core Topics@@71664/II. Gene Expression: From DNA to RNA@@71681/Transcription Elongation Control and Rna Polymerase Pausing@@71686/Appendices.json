A solution will be formulated.\n\n**Step 3: Derivation and Solution**\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the reduction factor $R = p(F)/p(0)$.\n\nFirst, we define the probability of pausing, $p(F)$, according to the provided basis (i). Pausing, with rate $k_{p}$, competes with forward translocation, with rate $k_{f}(F)$. The probability that pausing occurs before forward translocation is given by the ratio of its rate to the sum of the competing rates:\n$$\np(F) = \\frac{k_{p}}{k_{p} + k_{f}(F)}\n$$\nThe problem states that $k_{p}$ is independent of force.\n\nNext, we establish the force dependence of the forward translocation rate, $k_{f}(F)$, using basis (ii). An assisting force $F$ lowers the activation energy barrier for forward translocation by an amount equal to the mechanical work done, $W = F \\Delta x$. This accelerates the reaction. The rate at force $F$ is related to the zero-force rate $k_{f}(0)$ by the Boltzmann factor corresponding to this work:\n$$\nk_{f}(F) = k_{f}(0) \\exp\\left(\\frac{F \\Delta x}{k_{B} T}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $k_{f}(F)$ into the equation for $p(F)$ yields:\n$$\np(F) = \\frac{k_{p}}{k_{p} + k_{f}(0) \\exp\\left(\\frac{F \\Delta x}{k_{B} T}\\right)}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the pausing probability under an assisting force $F$.\n\nThe probability of pausing at zero force, $p(0)$, is obtained by setting $F=0$ in the above relations. When $F=0$, the exponential term becomes $\\exp(0)=1$, so $k_{f}(0) = k_{f}(0)$. Thus:\n$$\np(0) = \\frac{k_{p}}{k_{p} + k_{f}(0)}\n$$\nThe objective is to compute the reduction factor $R$, defined as the ratio $p(F)/p(0)$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{p(F)}{p(0)} = \\frac{\\frac{k_{p}}{k_{p} + k_{f}(F)}} {\\frac{k_{p}}{k_{p} + k_{f}(0)}}\n$$\nSimplifying this ratio by cancelling the common numerator $k_{p}$ gives:\n$$\nR = \\frac{k_{p} + k_{f}(0)}{k_{p} + k_{f}(F)}\n$$\nFinally, substituting the expression for $k_{f}(F)$ gives the complete symbolic form for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{k_{p} + k_{f}(0)}{k_{p} + k_{f}(0) \\exp\\left(\\frac{F \\Delta x}{k_{B} T}\\right)}\n$$\nNow, we must compute the numerical value of $R$.
