The assumptions are clearly stated and sufficient to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe task is to derive the fraction of active kinases and evaluate this quantity for a given set of parameters. This will be done in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the active fractions.\n\nLet us first consider the CDK4 kinase. The total concentration of CDK4, denoted by $T_{4}$, is the sum of the concentrations of its three possible states: unbound (free), bound to Cyclin D, and bound to p16.\n$$T_{4} = [CDK4] + [CDK4 \\cdot D] + [CDK4 \\cdot p16]$$\nHere, $[CDK4]$ is the concentration of free CDK4, $[CDK4 \\cdot D]$ is the concentration of the active complex with Cyclin D, and $[CDK4 \\cdot p16]$ is the concentration of the inactive complex with p16.\n\nThe problem states that binding follows the law of mass action at thermodynamic equilibrium. The dissociation constants are defined as $K = \\frac{[\\text{free receptor}][\\text{ligand}]}{[\\text{complex}]}$. For the CDK4 system, this leads to two equilibrium relations:\n$$K_{D4} = \\frac{[CDK4][D]}{[CDK4 \\cdot D]}$$\n$$K_{I4} = \\frac{[CDK4][p16]}{[CDK4 \\cdot p16]}$$\nThe free concentrations of Cyclin D and p16 are given as constant values, $[D] = d$ and $[p16] = i$. We can rearrange these equilibrium equations to express the concentrations of the bound complexes in terms of the free kinase concentration, $[CDK4]$:\n$$[CDK4 \\cdot D] = \\frac{[CDK4]d}{K_{D4}}$$\n$$[CDK4 \\cdot p16] = \\frac{[CDK4]i}{K_{I4}}$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the mass balance equation for $T_4$:\n$$T_{4} = [CDK4] + \\frac{[CDK4]d}{K_{D4}} + \\frac{[CDK4]i}{K_{I4}}$$\nFactoring out $[CDK4]$ gives:\n$$T_{4} = [CDK4] \\left( 1 + \\frac{d}{K_{D4}} + \\frac{i}{K_{I4}} \\right)$$\nThe equilibrium fraction of CDK4 that is in the active, Cyclin D-bound state, denoted $p_{4}(d,i)$, is the ratio of the concentration of the active complex to the total concentration of CDK4:\n$$p_{4}(d,i) = \\frac{[CDK4 \\cdot D]}{T_{4}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $[CDK4 \\cdot D]$ and $T_{4}$:\n$$p_{4}(d,i) = \\frac{\\frac{[CDK4]d}{K_{D4}}}{[CDK4] \\left( 1 + \\frac{d}{K_{D4}} + \\frac{i}{K_{I4}} \\right)}$$\nThe term for the free kinase concentration, $[CDK4]$, cancels out, yielding the final expression for the active fraction of CDK4:\n$$p_{4}(d,i) = \\frac{\\frac{d}{K_{D4}}}{1 + \\frac{d}{K_{D4}} + \\frac{i}{K_{I4}}}$$\nThe derivation for the CDK6 kinase is entirely analogous.

The total kinase concentration is $T_{4} + T_{6} = 50 + 30 = 80$.\n$$F(d,i) = \\frac{T_{4}\\,p_{4} + T_{6}\\,p_{6}}{T_{4} + T_{6}} = \\frac{(50)\\left(\\frac{15}{29}\\right) + (30)\\left(\\frac{20}{29}\\right)}{80}$$\n$$F(d,i) = \\frac{\\frac{750}{29} + \\frac{600}{29}}{80} = \\frac{\\frac{1350}{29}}{80}$$\n$$F(d,i) = \\frac{1350}{29 \\times 80} = \\frac{135}{29 \\times 8} = \\frac{135}{232}$$\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we perform the division and round to four significant figures:\n$$F(d,i) = \\frac{135}{232} \\approx 0.58189655...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.5819$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5819}$$", "id": "2946082"}, {"introduction": "The phosphorylation of the Retinoblastoma protein (pRB) by CDKs is the key event that inactivates its tumor-suppressive function, a process involving multiple phosphorylation sites that creates a complex 'phospho-code'.

The problem is formalizable and relevant to the specified field of molecular and cell biology. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis begins at the level of a single phosphorylation site. Let $p$ be the probability that a site is in the phosphorylated state ($\\mathrm{P}$) and $u$ be the probability that it is in the unphosphorylated state ($\\mathrm{U}$).
