The components mentioned (CENP-A, CCAN, KMN, Ndc80) are canonical and their roles are described in a manner consistent with current scientific literature. The problem is a simplified, but scientifically plausible, model.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

It is a straightforward stoichiometric calculation based on a simplified biological model, which is a standard method for estimating theoretical limits in science.\n\nProceeding with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the total number of Nuclear division cycle 80 (Ndc80) complexes on a single kinetochore, based on a given number of Centromere Protein A (CENP-A) nucleosomes and a specified stoichiometric relationship.\n\nLet $N_{CENP-A}$ represent the number of CENP-A nucleosomes on the single chromatid's kinetochore. From the problem statement, we are given:\n$$N_{CENP-A} = 400$$\n\nThe problem defines a hierarchy of protein assembly: CENP-A nucleates the CCAN, which in turn recruits the KMN network, of which the Ndc80 complex is a part. However, for the purpose of this calculation, the intermediate components are superfluous details. The critical piece of information is the direct stoichiometric link provided in the assumptions.\n\nLet $R$ be the defined ratio of Ndc80 complexes to CENP-A-marked units. A \"CENP-A-marked unit\" is identified as a CENP-A nucleosome. The a ssumption states that each CENP-A-marked unit recruits exactly $2$ Ndc80 complexes. Therefore, the ratio $R$ is:\n$$R = \\frac{\\text{Number of Ndc80 complexes}}{\\text{Number of CENP-A nucleosomes}} = 2$$\n\nWe are asked to compute the theoretical upper bound on the number of Ndc80 complexes per kinetochore. Let this quantity be $N_{Ndc80}$. The problem instructs to ignore all factors that might reduce this number in a real biological system, such as steric hindrance or regulatory processes. Thus, the calculation will indeed yield a theoretical maximum.\n\nThe total number of Ndc80 complexes is the product of the number of CENP-A nucleosomes and the number of Ndc80 complexes recruited per nucleosome.\n$$N_{Ndc80} = N_{CENP-A} \\times R$$\n\nSubstituting the given values into this equation:\n$$N_{Ndc80} = 400 \\times 2$$\n\nPerforming the multiplication gives the final result:\n$$N_{Ndc80} = 800$$\n\nThis value represents the theoretical upper limit on the number of microtubule-binding Ndc80 complexes for the specified kinetochore, under the idealized conditions described.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{800}\n$$", "id": "2950733"}, {"introduction": "A kinetochore's attachment to a microtubule must be robust enough to withstand significant pulling forces, yet dynamic enough to allow for the correction of errors.

The derivation must be grounded in the law of mass action and basic probability theory.\n\nFirst, we analyze the binding equilibrium for a single site. Let $S$ represent a single unbound binding site on the kinetochore module, and let $L$ be the free ligand concentration, which corresponds to the density of binding epitopes on the microtubule. The reversible binding reaction is:\n$$ S + L \\rightleftharpoons SL $$\nwhere $SL$ is the site-ligand complex.\n\nThe dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the law of mass action at equilibrium:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[S][L]}{[SL]} $$\nThe total concentration of sites is $[S]_T = [S] + [SL]$. The probability that a single site is bound, which we shall denote $p_b$, is the fraction of occupied sites:\n$$ p_b = \\frac{[SL]}{[S]_T} = \\frac{[SL]}{[S] + [SL]} $$\nTo express $p_b$ as a function of $L$ and $K_d$, we first rearrange the definition of $K_d$ to solve for the concentration of free sites, $[S]$:\n$$ [S] = K_d \\frac{[SL]}{[L]} $$\nSubstituting this expression into the equation for $p_b$:\n$$ p_b = \\frac{[SL]}{K_d \\frac{[SL]}{[L]} + [SL]} $$\nFactoring out $[SL]$ from the denominator gives:\n$$ p_b = \\frac{[SL]}{[SL] \\left( \\frac{K_d}{L} + 1 \\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{L} + 1} = \\frac{L}{K_d + L} $$\nThis is the standard binding isotherm for a single-site model.\n\nThe probability that a single site is unbound, $p_u$, is the complement of $p_b$:\n$$ p_u = 1 - p_b = 1 - \\frac{L}{K_d + L} = \\frac{(K_d + L) - L}{K_d + L} = \\frac{K_d}{K_d + L} $$\n\nNow, consider the multivalent complex with $n$ such sites. The problem states that the sites are independent. The complex is defined as being in the \"bound\" state if at least one of its $n$ sites is engaged. It is more direct to first calculate the probability of the complementary event: the complex being entirely \"unbound\". This occurs only if all $n$ sites are simultaneously unbound.\n\nLet $P(\\text{unbound})$ be the probability that the multivalent complex is unbound. Due to the independence of the sites, this is the product of the individual probabilities of each site being unbound:\n$$ P(\\text{unbound}) = (p_u)^n = \\left( \\frac{K_d}{K_d + L} \\right)^n $$\nThe probability that the complex is \"bound\", $P(\\text{bound})$, is therefore:\n$$ P(\\text{bound}) = 1 - P(\\text{unbound}) = 1 - \\left( \\frac{K_d}{K_d + L} \\right)^n $$\n\nThe problem defines the apparent multivalent dissociation constant, $K_{d,\\mathrm{eff}}(n)$, as the specific ligand concentration $L$ at which the probability that the multivalent module is bound equals one half.
