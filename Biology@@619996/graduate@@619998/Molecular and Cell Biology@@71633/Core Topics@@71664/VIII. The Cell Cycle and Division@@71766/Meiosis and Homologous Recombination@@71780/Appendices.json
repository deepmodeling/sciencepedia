A single homologous chromosome pair (a bivalent) is considered.\n2.  Accurate homolog disjunction at meiosis I requires two conditions to be met simultaneously: (i) arm cohesin cleavage and (ii) centromeric cohesion protection.\n3.  The probability of centromeric Rec8 being protected is designated as $p$.\n4.  The probability of arm Rec8 being cleaved is designated as $q$.\n5.  These two events are stipulated to be probabilistically independent.\n6.  No other failure modes are considered.\n7.  A meiosis I nondisjunction event is defined as the failure to achieve accurate homolog disjunction due to these cohesion errors.\n8.  The task is to derive an analytic expression for the frequency of meiosis I nondisjunction in terms of $p$ and $q$.\n\nValidation is performed based on these givens. The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established molecular biology of meiosis, specifically the roles of cohesin, Separase, and Shugoshin. The use of a simplified probabilistic model is a standard and valid approach in theoretical biology for analyzing complex systems. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and assumptions (event probabilities, independence) to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nLet us define the events required for a successful meiosis I disjunction.\nLet $C$ be the event that centromeric cohesin is correctly protected. The problem states the probability of this event is $P(C) = p$.\nLet $A$ be the event that arm cohesin is correctly cleaved. The problem states the probability of this event is $P(A) = q$.\n\nThe problem states that for accurate homolog disjunction to occur, both of these events must happen. Let us denote the event of accurate disjunction by $D_{acc}$. The event $D_{acc}$ corresponds to the intersection of events $C$ and $A$.\n$$D_{acc} = C \\cap A$$\n\nThe problem also provides the critical assumption that the events $C$ and $A$ are probabilistically independent. By the definition of independence, the probability of the intersection of two independent events is the product of their individual probabilities.\n$$P(D_{acc}) = P(C \\cap A) = P(C)P(A)$$\nSubstituting the given probabilities, we find the probability of an accurate disjunction event:\n$$P(D_{acc}) = pq$$\n\nThe problem asks for the frequency, which in this probabilistic context is the probability, of a meiosis I nondisjunction event. A nondisjunction event, denoted here as $ND_{I}$, is defined as any outcome in which accurate homolog disjunction *fails* to occur due to the specified cohesion errors. This means that the event $ND_I$ is the logical complement of the event $D_{acc}$.\n$$ND_I = (D_{acc})^{c}$$\n\nThe probability of a complement event is $1$ minus the probability of the event itself.\n$$P(ND_I) = P((D_{acc})^{c}) = 1 - P(D_{acc})$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $P(D_{acc})$ that we derived, we obtain the expression for the probability of nondisjunction.\n$$P(ND_I) = 1 - pq$$\n\nThis expression represents the probability that at least one of the necessary conditions for accurate disjunction fails. The failure can be a failure to protect centromeric cohesion (with probability $1-p$), a failure to cleave arm cohesion (with probability $1-q$), or both. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for the union of the complement events $C^c$ and $A^c$, we can verify this result:\n$P(C^c \\cup A^c) = P(C^c) + P(A^c) - P(C^c \\cap A^c)$.\nSince $C$ and $A$ are independent, so are their complements $C^c$ and $A^c$.\n$P(C^c) = 1 - p$.\n$P(A^c) = 1 - q$.\n$P(C^c \\cap A^c) = P(C^c)P(A^c) = (1-p)(1-q)$.\nSo, $P(ND_I) = (1 - p) + (1 - q) - (1-p)(1-q) = 1 - p + 1 - q - (1 - p - q + pq) = 2 - p - q - 1 + p + q - pq = 1 - pq$.\nThe result is consistent.

For a stationary field, the conservation of probability requires that the divergence of the flux, $\\vec{J}$, is zero.\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J} = 0\n$$\nAccording to Fick's first law, the flux is proportional to the gradient of the concentration: $\\vec{J} = -D \\nabla c$. Substituting this into the conservation equation yields Laplace's equation for the steady-state concentration profile:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 c(\\vec{r}) = 0\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the concentration field is radially symmetric, so $c(\\vec{r}) = c(r)$. In spherical coordinates, Laplace's equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr} \\right) = 0\n$$\nIntegrating this equation twice with respect to $r$ gives the general solution:\n$$\nc(r) = C_2 - \\frac{C_1}{r}\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are integration constants determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nThe boundary conditions are as follows:\n$1$.
