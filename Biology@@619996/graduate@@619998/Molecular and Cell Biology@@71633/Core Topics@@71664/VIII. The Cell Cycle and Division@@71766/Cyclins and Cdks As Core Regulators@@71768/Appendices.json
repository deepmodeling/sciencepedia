It describes a standard competitive ligand binding scenario, a fundamental topic in biochemistry. All necessary parameters are provided, and the assumptions are clearly stated and physically reasonable for an *in vitro* system. The problem is valid.\n\nLet us denote the molecular species as follows: $K$ for free CDK2, $A$ for free Cyclin A, and $I$ for free p27 inhibitor. The complexes are $KA$ (CDK2:Cyclin A) and $KI$ (CDK2:p27). The total concentration of CDK2 is $[K]_T$. The problem states that only the $KA$ complex is catalytically active.\n\nThe system is governed by two reversible binding equilibria:\n$$K + A \\rightleftharpoons KA$$\n$$K + I \\rightleftharpoons KI$$\n\nUnder the law of mass action, these equilibria are described by their respective dissociation constants, $K_{d,A}$ and $K_{d,I}$:\n$$K_{d,A} = \\frac{[K][A]}{[KA]}$$\n$$K_{d,I} = \\frac{[K][I]}{[KI]}$$\n\nThe total concentration of CDK2 is conserved, according to the principle of mass conservation. Since binding is mutually exclusive, the total CDK2 is the sum of the free form and the two complexed forms:\n$$[K]_T = [K] + [KA] + [KI]$$\n\nFrom the equilibrium expressions, we can express the concentrations of the complexes in terms of the free CDK2 concentration, $[K]$:\n$$[KA] = \\frac{[K][A]}{K_{d,A}}$$\n$$[KI] = \\frac{[K][I]}{K_{d,I}}$$\n\nSubstituting these into the conservation equation for CDK2 gives:\n$$[K]_T = [K] + \\frac{[K][A]}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{[K][I]}{K_{d,I}} = [K] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{[I]}{K_{d,I}} \\right)$$\n\nThe problem states that the total ligand concentrations, $[A]_T$ and $[I]_T$, are much larger than the total CDK2 concentration, $[K]_T$.

The solutions are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\nP^{*} = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n$$\nWe must select the physically valid root. Since $P^{*}$ represents a fraction, its value must be within the interval $[0, 1]$. Let us define the function $f(P) = aP^2 + bP + c$. We evaluate this function at the boundaries of the physical domain:\nAt $P=0$:\n$f(0) = c = V_{\\max 1} K_{m2}$.

Since $f(P)$ is a quadratic, it can have at most two roots.\n\nWe analyze two cases based on the sign of the coefficient $a$:\nCase 1: $a = V_{\\max 2} - V_{\\max 1} > 0$. The parabola $f(P)$ opens upwards. As $f(0) > 0$ and $f(1)  0$, one root must lie in $(0, 1)$ and the other must be greater than $1$.

As $f(0) > 0$ and $f(1)  0$, one root must lie in $(0, 1)$ and the other must be less than $0$. The physically relevant solution is the larger of the two roots (the positive one).\n\nIn Case 1 ($a > 0$), the smaller root corresponds to the minus sign in the quadratic formula: $P^{*} = \\frac{-b - \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\nIn Case 2 ($a  0$), we require the positive root. The discriminant $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = b^2 + 4|a|c$ is always greater than $b^2$, so $\\sqrt{\\Delta} > |b|$. The numerator $-b - \\sqrt{\\Delta}$ is always negative, while $-b + \\sqrt{\\Delta}$ is always positive. Since the denominator $2a$ is negative, the positive root is obtained from the negative numerator: $P^{*} = \\frac{-b - \\sqrt{\\Delta}}{2a}$.\n\nIn both cases, the unique physical solution is given by using the minus sign before the radical.

Mitotic entry occurs with near-normal timing; anaphase onset fails and mitotic exit is blocked because high $Cyclin\\ B-CDK1$ activity persists. In $APC/C$ assays, $Securin$ is robustly polyubiquitinated and degraded once the spindle assembly checkpoint is satisfied, whereas the $D-box$ mutant $Cyclin\\ B$ is not detectably polyubiquitinated and remains stable.

The experimental setup described (knock-in mutation, cell synchronization, biosensors) is standard in modern cell biology research. All molecules and processes mentioned ($Cyclin\\ B$, $CDK1$, $APC/C$, $Cdc20$, $Cdh1$, $D-box$, etc.) are real and their functions are well-characterized.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The initial conditions ($G_2$/$M$ arrest), the specific perturbation ($D-box$ mutation), and the core principles to be used are all clearly defined. This structure allows for a unique, logical deduction of the system's behavior.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is technical, precise, and devoid of subjective claims.\n\nThe problem does not violate any criteria for invalidity. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, or ill-posed. It presents a standard, yet non-trivial, conceptual problem in cell cycle regulation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe problem requires predicting the phenotype of cells expressing a non-degradable $Cyclin\\ B$. Let us reason through the mitotic progression step-by-step based on the provided principles.\n\n1. **Mitotic Entry**: The cells are synchronized at the $G_2$/$M$ boundary, a point where $Cyclin\\ B–CDK1$ activity is naturally high and poised to trigger M-phase events. The problem states that the mutant $Cyclin\\ B$ forms an active kinase with $CDK1$ normally. Therefore, upon release from synchrony, these cells will experience high $CDK1$ activity, leading to phosphorylation of mitotic substrates and subsequent nuclear envelope breakdown. Mitotic entry will thus occur with timing comparable to wild-type cells.\n\n2. **Metaphase-to-Anaphase Transition**: As cells progress to metaphase, chromosomes align at the metaphase plate. The problem specifies that the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is satisfied. The satisfaction of the SAC relieves its inhibition on the $APC/C$ coactivator $Cdc20$, leading to the formation of active $APC/C^{Cdc20}$.\nThe primary substrates of $APC/C^{Cdc20}$ are $Securin$ and mitotic cyclins (like $Cyclin\\ B$).\n- $Securin$, which contains both $D-box$ and KEN-box degrons, is a valid substrate and will be targeted for polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.\n- The mutant $Cyclin\\ B$, however, has a mutated $D-box$ that abolishes $APC/C$ recognition. Consequently, it will not be ubiquitinated and will remain stable.\n\n3. **Anaphase Onset**: Anaphase onset is triggered by the activation of $Separase$, a protease that cleaves the $cohesin$ rings holding sister chromatids together. $Separase$ activity is inhibited by two mechanisms: binding to $Securin$ and inhibitory phosphorylation by $CDK1$. The degradation of $Securin$ is the primary trigger for $Separase$ activation. However, sustained high $CDK1$ activity can maintain inhibitory phosphorylation on $Separase$, preventing its full activation. In this experimental system, $Cyclin\\ B–CDK1$ activity will remain maximally high because $Cyclin\\ B$ is non-degradable. Even with $Securin$ removed, this persistent high $CDK$ activity is sufficient to block $Separase$ function. Therefore, the biosensor will not detect $Separase$ activity, sister chromatids will not separate, and anaphase onset will fail. The cell will arrest in a metaphase-like state.\n\n4. **Mitotic Exit**: Mitotic exit is defined by the reversal of mitotic phosphorylations, which requires the inactivation of $CDK1$. Since $Cyclin\\ B$ cannot be degraded, $CDK1$ activity remains high indefinitely. This blocks mitotic exit by definition. A key event in mitotic exit is the dephosphorylation and activation of the $APC/C$ coactivator $Cdh1$. $Cdh1$ activation requires low $CDK$ activity. Because $CDK1$ activity remains high, $Cdh1$ stays phosphorylated and inactive. Consequently, the $APC/C^{Cdh1}$ E3 ligase is never formed. Substrates normally degraded by $APC/C^{Cdh1}$ in late mitosis and $G_1$—such as $Cdc20$ itself, $Geminin$, and other mitotic proteins—will not be degraded. They will remain stable.\n\n**Summary of Predictions**:\n- **Mitotic Entry**: Normal.\n- **Anaphase Onset**: Fails due to persistent inhibition of $Separase$ by high $CDK1$ activity.\n- **Mitotic Exit**: Blocked due to high, stable $CDK1$ activity.\n- **Substrate Turnover**: $Securin$ is polyubiquitinated and degraded. The $D-box$ mutant $Cyclin\\ B$ is stable. $APC/C^{Cdh1}$ substrates (e.g., $Geminin$) and $Cdc20$ are also stabilized due to the failure to activate $Cdh1$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Mitotic entry occurs with near-normal timing; anaphase onset fails and mitotic exit is blocked because high Cyclin B–CDK1 activity persists. In APC/C assays, Securin is robustly polyubiquitinated and degraded once the spindle assembly checkpoint is satisfied, whereas the D-box mutant Cyclin B is not detectably polyubiquitinated and remains stable. Because CDK activity does not decline, Cdh1 remains inhibited, so late APC/C$^{\\mathrm{Cdh}1}$ substrates (for example, Geminin) and Cdc$20$ itself fail to turn over.**\nThis option aligns perfectly with our detailed analysis. It correctly predicts normal mitotic entry, failed anaphase onset due to high $CDK1$ activity, a complete block in mitotic exit, the differential degradation of $Securin$ but not mutant $Cyclin\\ B$, and the failure to activate $APC/C^{Cdh1}$ and degrade its substrates.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Mitotic entry is delayed because the mutant Cyclin B dominantly sequesters APC/C, and mitotic exit is accelerated because Cyclin B cannot bind APC/C and is therefore degraded faster by Skp1–Cullin–F-box complexes. In APC/C assays, both Securin and Cyclin B show reduced polyubiquitination, while late APC/C$^{\\mathrm{Cdh}1}$ substrates are cleared normally.**\nThis option is incorrect for multiple reasons. 1) The mutation abolishes $APC/C$ binding, so it cannot sequester it; mitotic entry should be normal. 2) Mitotic exit is blocked, not accelerated. 3) Mitotic cyclins are not substrates for $SCF$ complexes. 4) $Securin$ ubiquitination should be robust, not reduced. 5) $APC/C^{Cdh1}$ is not activated, so its substrates are not cleared.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Mitotic entry is normal and anaphase proceeds with only a slight delay because Securin is degraded; mitotic exit completes, but cytokinesis fails due to excess Cyclin B. In APC/C assays, Securin is stabilized due to competitive inhibition by the mutant Cyclin B, whereas Cyclin B is polyubiquitinated through an alternative KEN-box, and late APC/C$^{\\mathrm{Cdh}1}$ substrates are unaffected.**\nThis option contains several errors. 1) Mitotic exit cannot complete if $Cyclin\\ B–CDK1$ activity is high. 2) $Securin$ is not stabilized by competitive inhibition; the mutant $Cyclin\\ B$ does not bind $APC/C$. 3) The problem states $APC/C$ recognition is abolished, contradicting the idea of degradation via an alternative degron. 4) Anaphase onset is expected to fail, not proceed.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Mitotic entry is advanced due to elevated Cyclin B levels; mitotic exit is unaffected because Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) compensates for sustained CDK activity. In APC/C assays, global substrate polyubiquitination is unchanged because SCF complexes compensate for loss of APC/C recognition of Cyclin B.**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. 1) $Cyclin\\ B$ synthesis is normal, not elevated, so mitotic entry timing should be normal, not advanced. 2) Phosphatases cannot \"compensate\" for constitutively active $CDK1$; this view contradicts the bistable switch model of mitotic control. Mitotic exit is blocked. 3) $SCF$ complexes do not degrade mitotic cyclins, so they cannot compensate. 4) Global substrate polyubiquitination is drastically changed because a major substrate ($Cyclin\\ B$) and all $APC/C^{Cdh1}$ substrates are stabilized.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2940299"}]}
