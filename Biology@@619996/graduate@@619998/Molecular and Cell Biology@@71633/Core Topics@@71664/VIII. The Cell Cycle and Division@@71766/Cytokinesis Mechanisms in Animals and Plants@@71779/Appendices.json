At cellular scales and speeds, inertial effects are negligible, so the instantaneous net force on the ring is approximately zero, i.e., contractile force balances resistive forces. Use the following well-tested physical bases:\n- A surface with uniform tension $\\tau$ exerts a line traction of magnitude $\\tau$ per unit length along its boundary; for a circular boundary of radius $R$, this produces a resisting force $F_{\\text{tension}}(R)$ proportional to the circumference.\n- Viscous resistance for slow radial motion at length scale $R$ can be approximated by a Stokes-like drag $F_{\\text{visc}}(R,\\dot{R}) = 6\\pi \\eta R \\dot{R}$ opposing the motion.\n\nAssuming these approximations, write the force balance for the ring and derive a closed-form expression for the instantaneous furrow ingression speed $v(R)$, defined as $v(R) \\equiv -\\dot{R}$, in terms of $F$, $\\tau$, $\\eta$, and $R$.

Do not include units in your final expression.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the furrow ingression speed, $v(R)$, during animal cell cytokinesis based on a mechanical force balance. The system is in the low Reynolds number regime, where inertial effects are negligible. Therefore, the net force on the contractile ring is zero at all times. This implies that the active contractile force is exactly balanced by the sum of the resistive forces.\n\nThe principle is the force balance equation:\n$$F_{\\text{contractile}} = \\sum F_{\\text{resistive}}$$\nwhere all terms represent the magnitudes of the forces.\n\nWe must identify each force component based on the givens.\n\n1.  **Contractile Force ($F_{\\text{contractile}}$)**: The problem states that the actomyosin ring generates a net contractile force of magnitude $F$. This force drives the inward movement of the furrow.\n    $$F_{\\text{contractile}} = F$$\n\n2.  **Resistive Forces ($F_{\\text{resistive}}$)**: Two resistive forces oppose the contraction.\n\n    a. **Force due to Surface Tension ($F_{\\text{tension}}$)**: The cortical surface tension $\\tau$ gives rise to a resistive force. The problem states that a surface with tension $\\tau$ exerts a line traction of magnitude $\\tau$ per unit length on its boundary. For the circular contractile ring of radius $R$, the boundary is its circumference, which has a length of $2\\pi R$. This tension pulls the ring outward, resisting contraction. The magnitude of this force is the line traction multiplied by the length of the circumference:\n    $$F_{\\text{tension}} = \\tau \\cdot (2\\pi R) = 2\\pi R \\tau$$\n\n    b. **Force due to Viscous Drag ($F_{\\text{visc}}$)**: The movement of the ring through the viscous cytoplasm with viscosity $\\eta$ generates a drag force. The furrow ingression speed is defined as $v(R) \\equiv -\\dot{R}$, where $\\dot{R} = \\frac{dR}{dt}$ is the radial velocity of the ring. Since the ring is contracting, $\\dot{R}$ is negative, and $v(R)$ is positive. The problem gives the form of the viscous resistance as $F_{\\text{visc}}(R,\\dot{R}) = 6\\pi \\eta R \\dot{R}$ opposing the motion. A drag force must have a direction opposite to the velocity. The inward velocity is $\\dot{R}$. Therefore, the drag force must be directed outward, and its expression as a function of the speed $v = |\\dot{R}| = -\\dot{R}$ is obtained from the provided formula by considering its magnitude. The magnitude of the viscous drag force is:\n    $$F_{\\text{visc}} = |6\\pi \\eta R \\dot{R}| = 6\\pi \\eta R |\\dot{R}| = 6\\pi \\eta R v(R)$$\n\nNow, we formulate the force balance equation by equating the magnitude of the contractile force to the sum of the magnitudes of the resistive forces:\n$$F = F_{\\text{tension}} + F_{\\text{visc}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for each force, we obtain:\n$$F = 2\\pi R \\tau + 6\\pi \\eta R v(R)$$\nThe goal is to find an expression for the instantaneous furrow ingression speed, $v(R)$. We must solve the above equation for $v(R)$.\nRearranging the equation to isolate the term containing $v(R)$:\n$$6\\pi \\eta R v(R) = F - 2\\pi R \\tau$$\nFinally, dividing by the coefficient $6\\pi \\eta R$ yields the expression for $v(R)$:\n$$v(R) = \\frac{F - 2\\pi R \\tau}{6\\pi \\eta R}$$\nThis expression can be simplified by splitting the fraction:\n$$v(R) = \\frac{F}{6\\pi \\eta R} - \\frac{2\\pi R \\tau}{6\\pi \\eta R} = \\frac{F}{6\\pi \\eta R} - \\frac{\\tau}{3\\eta}$$\nHowever, the single fraction form is more directly representative of the underlying force balance.

This exercise sharpens your ability to reason through complex, multi-step biophysical scenarios and reinforces the crucial mechanistic differences between animal and plant cytokinesis.", "problem": "A spherical animal cell undergoing cytokinesis in suspension can be idealized as two lobes connected by an equatorial furrow of radius $r(t)$. The actomyosin contractile ring at the furrow exerts a circumferential line tension $T$ that is set by myosin motor activity. The cytoplasm has a hydrostatic pressure $P_{\\text{in}}$ and the surrounding medium has hydrostatic pressure $P_{\\text{out}}$, so the net hydrostatic pressure that resists furrow ingression is $\\Delta P \\equiv P_{\\text{in}} - P_{\\text{out}}$. You may assume:\n- Osmotic pressure is given by the van ’t Hoff relation $\\Pi = c R T_{\\text{abs}}$, with solute concentration $c$, gas constant $R$, and absolute temperature $T_{\\text{abs}}$; water flows until chemical potentials balance, such that changes in external osmolarity drive changes in cell volume and produce corresponding changes in $\\Delta P$.\n- For a membrane–cortex shell enclosing a pressurized fluid, the Young–Laplace relation links hydrostatic pressure and curvature to cortical tension: for a sphere of radius $R$, $\\Delta P = 2\\gamma/R$, where $\\gamma$ is the effective membrane–cortex surface tension. When the cell swells, membrane and cortex are stretched (increasing $\\gamma$); when the cell shrinks, membrane slack reduces $\\gamma$.\n- Under a fixed myosin activity, the ring’s active tension $T$ is held constant. Furrow ingression speed $v$ is a decreasing function of the resisting load associated with $\\Delta P$.

I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe task is to determine the effect of osmotic shifts on cytokinesis in both animal and plant cells based on the provided framework.\n\n**Part 1: Animal Cell Cytokinesis**\n\nWe analyze the causal chain for each osmotic condition.\n\n*   **Hyperosmotic Shift**:\n    1.  The external medium has a higher solute concentration than the cytoplasm.\n    2.  Due to osmosis, water flows out of the cell to equilibrate water potential.\n    3.  The cell loses volume and shrinks. This means the characteristic radius $R$ of the cell lobes decreases.\n    4.  The problem states that when the cell shrinks, \"membrane slack reduces $\\gamma$.\" Therefore, the effective surface tension $\\gamma$ decreases.\n    5.  The net hydrostatic pressure is given by the Young-Laplace relation, $\\Delta P = 2\\gamma/R$. Both the numerator $\\gamma$ and the denominator $R$ decrease. However, the reduction in tension $\\gamma$ in a slack, wrinkled membrane is the dominant physical effect. A flaccid bag cannot sustain high internal pressure. Thus, the net hydrostatic pressure $\\Delta P$ decreases.\n    6.  $\\Delta P$ constitutes the resisting load against which the contractile ring works. The ingression speed $v$ is a decreasing function of this load.\n    7.  Since $\\Delta P$ decreases, the resistance to furrowing is reduced. With a constant active tension $T$ from the ring, the ingression speed $v$ will increase.\n\n*   **Hypoosmotic Shift**:\n    1.  The external medium has a lower solute concentration than the cytoplasm.\n    2.  Water flows into the cell.\n    3.  The cell gains volume and swells. The radius $R$ increases.\n    4.  The problem states that when the cell swells, \"membrane and cortex are stretched (increasing $\\gamma$)\".\n    5.  From $\\Delta P = 2\\gamma/R$, the tension $\\gamma$ increases due to stretching, and the radius $R$ also increases. The increased tension is what generates the pressure resisting further swelling. Thus, the net hydrostatic pressure $\\Delta P$ increases significantly.\n    6.  The resisting load $\\Delta P$ on the contractile ring increases.\n    7.  Since $v$ is a decreasing function of the load, the higher resistance will cause the ingression speed $v$ to decrease. If $\\Delta P$ increases sufficiently, it can overcome the force generated by the ring, leading to a stall in cytokinesis.\n\n**Conclusion for Animal Cells**: A hyperosmotic shift decreases $\\Delta P$ and speeds up ingression. A hypoosmotic shift increases $\\Delta P$ and slows down or stalls ingression.\n\n**Part 2: Plant Cell Cytokinesis**\n\n*   The problem statement is explicit: \"In walled plant cells, cytokinesis proceeds by phragmoplast-guided cell-plate assembly rather than equatorial cortex ingression.\"\n*   This is a fundamentally different mechanism. It does not involve a contractile ring an animal cell uses. Instead, it involves the formation of a new cell wall (the cell plate) from the center of the cell outwards.\n*   While osmotic shifts will certainly change the turgor pressure of the plant cell (the pressure of the protoplast against the cell wall), this change does not directly modulate the speed of a \"furrow ingression\" process because such a process does not exist in plant cells. Therefore, the logic applied to the animal cell is irrelevant to the mechanism of plant cell cytokinesis.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. In animal cells with a contractile ring and constant $T$, a hyperosmotic shift lowers $\\Delta P$ and therefore increases the ingression speed $v$; a hypoosmotic shift raises $\\Delta P$ and therefore slows or can stall ingression. In walled plant cells, cytokinesis lacks an ingression step, so changing external osmolarity primarily modulates turgor but has little direct effect on an ingression process that does not occur.**\n    This statement perfectly aligns with the derived conclusions for both animal and plant cells. It correctly identifies the effects on $\\Delta P$ and $v$ in animal cells and correctly notes the mechanistic difference in plant cells, making the concept of \"ingression\" inapplicable.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. In animal cells, hyperosmotic conditions increase $\\Delta P$ by compressing the cell and thus slow ingression, whereas hypoosmotic conditions decrease $\\Delta P$ and therefore speed ingression; the same applies to walled plant cells because their division requires equatorial ingression.**\n    The conclusion for animal cells is the exact opposite of what was derived. Furthermore, the statement that plant cells undergo equatorial ingression is factually incorrect.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. If myosin activity is held constant, neither hyperosmotic nor hypoosmotic shifts change $\\Delta P$ appreciably, so ingression speed is unchanged; this is true for both animal and plant cells.**\n    This contradicts the premise that osmotic shifts cause volume changes that, via the Young-Laplace relation, alter $\\Delta P$. It is fundamentally incorrect.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Because of the Young–Laplace relation $\\Delta P = 2\\gamma/R$, shrinking the cell under hyperosmotic conditions decreases $R$ and hence must increase $\\Delta P$ at constant $\\gamma$, so hyperosmotic media slow ingression; hypoosmotic media increase $R$, decrease $\\Delta P$, and speed ingression; plant cells behave analogously.**\n    This option makes a critical reasoning error. It assumes $\\gamma$ is constant, which is explicitly contradicted by the problem statement (\"membrane slack reduces $\\gamma$\"). This flawed reasoning leads to the wrong conclusion for animal cells. The statement about plant cells is also incorrect.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. In animal cells, hyperosmotic media decrease $\\Delta P$ and speed ingression, and hypoosmotic media increase $\\Delta P$ and slow ingression; in walled plant cells, the same hyperosmotic treatment will likewise speed up an equatorial ingression step during cytokinesis.**\n    The description for animal cells is correct. However, the description for plant cells is factually wrong; they do not have an equatorial ingression step. Since the question asks for the single best option, and this option contains a significant error, it is not the best choice.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis, Option A is the only one that is correct in all its parts.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2940472"}]}
