It presents a straightforward application of kinematics to a biological process, the loop extrusion model of chromosome condensation. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nLet $L(t)$ be the size of the DNA loop in kilobase pairs ($\\text{kb}$) at time $t$ in seconds ($\\text{s}$). The problem states that the loop grows at a constant speed, which is the rate of change of its size with respect to time. We denote this speed as $v$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$ v = \\frac{dL}{dt} $$\nThe given values are:\nThe loop-growth speed, $v = 1\\,\\text{kb}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\nThe final desired loop size, $L_{final} = 100\\,\\text{kb}$.\n\nSince the speed $v$ is constant, we can solve for the time duration $\\Delta t$ required to achieve a change in loop size $\\Delta L$ by integrating the differential equation or, more simply, by using the algebraic relation for constant rate of change. Assuming the loop starts from a size of $L_{initial} = 0$ at time $t_{initial} = 0$, the change in size is $\\Delta L = L_{final} - L_{initial} = 100\\,\\text{kb} - 0\\,\\text{kb} = 100\\,\\text{kb}$. The time duration is $\\Delta t = t_{final} - t_{initial} = t_{final} - 0 = t_{final}$.\n\nThe relationship is therefore:\n$$ L_{final} = v \\cdot t_{final} $$\nWe solve for the final time, $t_{final}$:\n$$ t_{final} = \\frac{L_{final}}{v} $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$ t_{final} = \\frac{100\\,\\text{kb}}{1\\,\\text{kb}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} $$\nThe units of kilobases ($\\text{kb}$) cancel, leaving the result in seconds ($\\text{s}$):\n$$ t_{final} = 100\\,\\text{s} $$\nThe problem also requires an assessment of this timescale in the context of prophase.

The solution must also include a qualitative discussion on the feasibility of the given parameters. The validation of the problem statement confirms that it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and free of fatal flaws. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe model is based on a bottlebrush polymer representation of a chromatid, with the following relationships, which are assumed to be exact for this problem based on the provided instructions (\"under the assumptions of uniform loop size and uniform axial spacing\"):\n1. The total DNA content packaged into loops is $B_{\\text{packed}} = N \\ell$, where $N$ is the number of active condensin complexes (and thus loops) and $\\ell$ is the uniform loop size.\n2. The axial length of the chromatid is $L = N \\delta$, where $\\delta$ is the uniform spacing between loop bases along the chromosome axis.\n\nThe provided parameters are:\n- Total DNA content of the chromatid: $B = 4.8 \\times 10^{7}$ base pairs.\n- Uniform loop size: $\\ell = 1.0 \\times 10^{5}$ base pairs.\n- Uniform loop-base spacing: $\\delta = 10$ nm.\n- Target metaphase axial length: $L_{\\text{target}} = 5$ $\\mu$m.\n\nWe must find the minimal number of active condensin complexes, $N_{\\min}$, that satisfies two simultaneous conditions:\n1.  **Full accommodation of chromosomal DNA:** The total DNA packaged into loops must be at least the total DNA content of the chromatid. This establishes the constraint:\n    $$N \\ell \\ge B$$\n2.  **Achievement of the target axial length:** The axial length of the chromatid produced by $N$ loop bases must be equal to the specified target length. This establishes the constraint:\n    $$N \\delta = L_{\\text{target}}$$\n\nFirst, we must ensure all units are consistent. We will use nanometers (nm) for length.\nThe target axial length is given as $L_{\\text{target}} = 5$ $\\mu$m. We convert this to nanometers:\n$$L_{\\text{target}} = 5 \\,\\,\\mu\\text{m} \\times \\frac{10^3 \\,\\,\\text{nm}}{1 \\,\\,\\mu\\text{m}} = 5 \\times 10^3 \\,\\,\\text{nm}$$\nThe loop-base spacing is given as $\\delta = 10$ nm.\n\nFrom the second condition (axial length), we can determine the precise number of condensin complexes, $N$, required to form a chromatid of length $L_{\\text{target}}$.\n$$N = \\frac{L_{\\text{target}}}{\\delta}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$N = \\frac{5 \\times 10^3 \\,\\,\\text{nm}}{10 \\,\\,\\text{nm}} = 500$$\nThis condition fixes the number of condensins to be exactly $500$. Because this is the only value of $N$ that achieves the target length, it is by definition the minimal number that can do so.\n\nNext, we must verify if this number of complexes, $N=500$, also satisfies the first condition (DNA accommodation). The condition is $N\\ell \\ge B$. We substitute the values for $N$, $\\ell$, and $B$:\n$$500 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^5 \\,\\,\\text{base pairs}) \\ge 4.8 \\times 10^7 \\,\\,\\text{base pairs}$$\nCalculating the left-hand side:\n$$5.0 \\times 10^7 \\,\\,\\text{base pairs} \\ge 4.8 \\times 10^7 \\,\\,\\text{base pairs}$$\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, $N=500$ active condensin complexes are sufficient to both package the entire chromosomal DNA and achieve the target axial length. Since $N=500$ is the unique number satisfying the length constraint, it is the minimal number that satisfies both conditions simultaneously.\nThe problem requests an integer answer, which $500$ is.\n$$N_{\\min} = 500$$\n\nFor the qualitative discussion on the feasibility of the parameter triple $(\\ell, \\delta, L_{\\text{target}})$ for the given chromosome with DNA content $B$:\nThe calculation above reveals a subtle inconsistency. To achieve the target length of $L_{\\text{target}} = 5$ $\\mu$m with the given spacing $\\delta = 10$ nm, exactly $N=500$ condensins are required. With each condensin extruding a loop of size $\\ell = 1.0 \\times 10^5$ bp, the total amount of DNA that must be packaged into loops is:\n$$B_{\\text{packed}} = N \\ell = 500 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^5 \\,\\,\\text{bp}) = 5.0 \\times 10^7 \\,\\,\\text{bp}$$\nHowever, the total DNA content available on the chromatid is given as $B = 4.8 \\times 10^7$ bp.\nThe model requires packaging $B_{\\text{packed}} = 5.0 \\times 10^7$ bp, which is more than the available $B = 4.8 \\times 10^7$ bp. The discrepancy is $B_{\\text{packed}} - B = 2 \\times 10^6$ bp.\nThis implies that under the strict assumptions of uniform loop size and spacing, the given set of parameters is not perfectly self-consistent for the specified chromosome. It is physically impossible to form $500$ loops of size $10^5$ bp from a DNA molecule of only $4.8 \\times 10^7$ bp.\n\nIf the parameters were fully consistent, the number of condensins required to package the DNA, $N_{B} = B/\\ell$, would be equal to the number of condensins required to form the target length, $N_{L} = L_{\\text{target}}/\\delta$.\nIn our case:\n$$N_{B} = \\frac{4.8 \\times 10^7}{1.0 \\times 10^5} = 480$$\n$$N_{L} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^3}{10} = 500$$\nSince $N_{B} \\neq N_{L}$, the parameters are not jointly feasible. The model predicts a chromosome length of $L = N_B \\delta = 480 \\times 10 \\,\\,\\text{nm} = 4.8 \\,\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ if it were to package its DNA exactly, which does not match the target length of $5 \\,\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.

This exercise challenges you to connect the dynamic process of loop extrusion with its signature in chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments.

Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) condensin complexes load uniformly along the chromosome and extrude loops symmetrically at constant contour-speed $v$ until they dissociate stochastically from DNA. Dissociation is a memoryless (Poisson) process with rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, independent of loop size and position. When an extruding condensin encounters the barrier with one head, that head remains clamped at $x=0$ (no bypass), while the other head continues to extrude away from the barrier at the same speed $v$ until dissociation.

No numerical evaluation is required.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on the standard biophysical model of loop extrusion, a cornerstone of modern chromosome biology, and contains sufficient information for a unique, meaningful solution. We shall therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nFirst, we address the qualitative appearance of the feature on a contact map. A contact map is a representation of the frequency of spatial interaction between pairs of genomic loci, typically plotting the coordinates of the interacting loci $(x, y)$ on a two-dimensional grid. A condensin complex functions by binding to two locations on the DNA, say at genomic coordinates $x_1$ and $x_2$, and holding them in close proximity. This creates a contact that contributes to the signal at coordinates $(x_1, x_2)$ and $(x_2, x_1)$ on the map.\n\nIn this problem, we consider a subpopulation of condensins whose extrusion process is affected by an impenetrable barrier at genomic coordinate $x=0$. When one active head of an extruding condensin reaches this barrier, it becomes permanently anchored. The other head continues to extrude DNA away from the barrier. Consequently, this anchored condensin holds together the locus at the barrier, $x=0$, and another locus at a genomic coordinate $s > 0$. The size of the extruded loop is thus $s$. This generates a contact between loci $0$ and $s$.\n\nOn the contact map, this corresponds to a signal at coordinates $(0, s)$ and $(s, 0)$. The system is in a steady state, with a continuous flux of condensins arriving at the barrier and a population of anchored condensins with a distribution of loop sizes $s$. The collection of all such contacts, averaged over time, forms a line-like feature. Specifically, it appears as a vertical line (or \"stripe\")emanating from the origin along the $y$-axis (the line $x=0$ for $y > 0$) and a corresponding horizontal line along the $x$-axis (the line $y=0$ for $x > 0$). The origin $(0,0)$ corresponds to the position of the barrier on the main diagonal of the map.\n\nThe extrusion process is terminated by the stochastic dissociation of the condensin from the DNA, which is a Poisson process with rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$. To extrude a larger loop of size $s$, the condensin must persist for a longer time, $t = s/v$. The probability of survival decreases exponentially with time. Therefore, the number of condensins with large loops is smaller than the number with small loops. This causes the intensity of the line feature to decay with increasing distance $s$ from the barrier, effectively terminating the feature at a characteristic length scale.\n\nNext, we compute the steady-state intensity $I(s)$ along this feature as a function of the genomic separation $s$ from the barrier. The intensity $I(s)$ is proportional to the steady-state number density of barrier-anchored extruders that have a loop of size $s$. Let this density be $N(s)$.\n\nWe can derive $N(s)$ by considering the population dynamics of anchored extruders. Let $\\Phi$ be the constant flux of condensins becoming anchored at the barrier per unit time. This is the arrival rate into the state of being anchored. Consider the extruders that have been anchored for a time $t$. According to the given kinematics, their loop size is $s(t) = v t$. Dissociation is a memoryless process with rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, meaning the probability that a single condensin survives for a duration $t$ is given by the survival function $P_{\\text{survival}}(t) = \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{off}} t)$.\n\nIn a steady state, the population of anchored extruders can be viewed as a collection of cohorts that arrived at different times in the past. The number of extruders that arrived in an infinitesimal time interval $dt$ in the past is $\\Phi dt$. The number of these that are still present, i.e., have survived for a time $t$, is $(\\Phi dt) \\times P_{\\text{survival}}(t) = (\\Phi dt) \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{off}} t)$. This quantity represents the number of extruders in the steady-state population having an \"age\" (time since anchoring) between $t$ and $t+dt$.\n\nWe are interested in the number density as a function of loop size $s$. The number of extruders with loop sizes between $s$ and $s+ds$ is, by definition, $N(s)ds$. These extruders have ages between $t = s/v$ and $t+dt = (s+ds)/v$. The time interval corresponding to the loop size interval $ds$ is $dt = ds/v$. Substituting the relations for $t$ and $dt$ into our expression for the number of aged extruders, we find:\n$$N(s)ds = \\Phi \\exp\\left(-k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\frac{s}{v}\\right) dt = \\Phi \\exp\\left(-k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\frac{s}{v}\\right) \\frac{ds}{v}$$\nFrom this, we obtain the number density $N(s)$:\n$$N(s) = \\frac{\\Phi}{v} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{v}s\\right)$$\nThe contact intensity $I(s)$ is proportional to this density, so $I(s) = C N(s)$ for some constant of proportionality $C$ which depends on experimental details like crosslinking and ligation efficiencies.\n$$I(s) = \\frac{C\\Phi}{v} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{v}s\\right)$$\nThe pre-factor $\\frac{C\\Phi}{v}$ is a constant. We can determine it using the provided normalization condition, $I(0) = I_0$. At $s=0$:\n$$I(0) = \\frac{C\\Phi}{v} \\exp(0) = \\frac{C\\Phi}{v}$$\nTherefore, this constant pre-factor is equal to $I_0$. Substituting this back into the expression for $I(s)$, we arrive at the final analytical form for the intensity profile:\n$$I(s) = I_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{v}s\\right)$$\nThis expression shows that the intensity of the stripe feature decays exponentially from the barrier position, with a characteristic decay length of $\\frac{v}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}$.
