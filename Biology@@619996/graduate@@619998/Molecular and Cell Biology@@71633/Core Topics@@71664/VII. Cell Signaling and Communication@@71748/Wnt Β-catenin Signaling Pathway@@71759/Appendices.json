In the Wnt pathway, this logic centers on controlling the stability of the effector protein, β-catenin. This first exercise [@problem_id:2345633] presents a classic thought experiment involving a mutation that prevents β-catenin from being phosphorylated, effectively uncoupling it from its degradation machinery. By predicting the outcome, you will solidify your understanding of how post-translational modifications serve as the primary \"on/off\" switch for pathway activity.", "problem": "The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is a crucial regulator of cell fate determination, proliferation, and differentiation during embryonic development and in adult tissues. Its dysregulation is frequently implicated in cancer. The activity of this pathway is tightly controlled by the stability of the protein β-catenin.\n\nIn the absence of a Wnt signaling molecule (the \"OFF\" state), β-catenin is targeted for degradation by a cytoplasmic protein assembly known as the \"destruction complex.\" This complex includes the enzyme Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta (GSK3β), which phosphorylates β-catenin. This phosphorylation event marks β-catenin for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome, keeping its cytoplasmic concentration low. Consequently, target genes of the Wnt pathway remain transcriptionally repressed.\n\nIn the presence of a Wnt ligand (the \"ON\" state), the ligand binds to its cell surface receptors, initiating a cascade that leads to the inactivation of the destruction complex. As GSK3β is now inhibited, β-catenin is no longer phosphorylated, allowing it to accumulate in the cytoplasm. This stable β-catenin then translocates to the nucleus, where it associates with transcription factors of the TCF/LEF family to activate the expression of Wnt target genes.\n\nConsider a genetically engineered cell line in which the gene for β-catenin has been mutated. This mutation alters the specific amino acid residues that are normally phosphorylated by GSK3β, such that GSK3β can no longer phosphorylate this mutant form of β-catenin.\n\nAssuming these cells are grown in a medium that does not contain any Wnt ligands, which of the following outcomes is the most likely description of the state of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in this cell line?\n\nA. β-catenin will be rapidly degraded by the proteasome, and Wnt target genes will be transcriptionally repressed.\n\nB. β-catenin will accumulate, translocate to the nucleus, and Wnt target genes will be constitutively activated.\n\nC. The destruction complex will be unable to assemble, but because no Wnt ligand is present, Wnt target genes will remain off.\n\nD. β-catenin will accumulate in the cytoplasm but will be blocked from entering the nucleus.\n\nE. GSK3β will be constitutively inactivated, leading to the stabilization of many other proteins in the cell.", "solution": "We apply the core regulatory logic of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. In the absence of Wnt ligand (OFF state), the destruction complex (including APC, Axin, CK1, and GSK3β) phosphorylates β-catenin at specific N-terminal residues (CK1 primes, then GSK3β adds additional phosphates), generating a phospho-degron recognized by β-TrCP. This leads to polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, keeping cytosolic β-catenin low and TCF/LEF target genes repressed.\n\nIn the presence of Wnt (ON state), receptor engagement inhibits the destruction complex’s ability to phosphorylate β-catenin (including inhibition of GSK3β activity on β-catenin), stabilizing β-catenin, which accumulates, translocates to the nucleus, binds TCF/LEF, and activates target gene transcription.\n\nIn the engineered cells, the mutation alters the specific residues normally phosphorylated by GSK3β on β-catenin, such that GSK3β can no longer phosphorylate this mutant substrate. The key mechanistic consequence is that the phospho-dependent recognition by β-TrCP cannot occur, so ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation are impaired. This stabilization occurs independently of Wnt ligand because the block is at the level of substrate phosphorylation, not at the level of GSK3β activity or destruction complex assembly.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is incorrect because, without GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation, the mutant β-catenin is not efficiently ubiquitinated and degraded; repression would not be maintained.\n- Option B is correct: stabilized β-catenin will accumulate, enter the nucleus, and constitutively activate Wnt target genes even in the absence of ligand.\n- Option C is incorrect: the destruction complex may still assemble, but its inability to phosphorylate the mutant β-catenin does not keep target genes off; rather, it leads to stabilization and activation.\n- Option D is incorrect: the mutation affects phosphorylation sites, not nuclear import; stabilized β-catenin typically translocates to the nucleus.\n- Option E is incorrect: GSK3β is not globally inactivated; only its phosphorylation of the mutant β-catenin is prevented, so other GSK3β substrates are not necessarily stabilized.\n\nThus, the most likely outcome is constitutive activation of Wnt target genes due to stabilized, nuclear β-catenin in the absence of Wnt ligand.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2345633"}, {"introduction": "A deep understanding of signaling pathways is crucial for designing effective therapeutic strategies, especially in oncology. This practice problem [@problem_id:2345630] challenges you to apply your knowledge to a realistic clinical scenario where a colorectal cancer is driven by a loss-of-function mutation in the *APC* gene. By evaluating the efficacy of an upstream inhibitor, Dkk1, you will learn the critical principle of epistasis—how a downstream genetic lesion can render upstream interventions ineffective, a vital lesson in pathway-based drug development.", "problem": "In the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, the protein β-catenin plays a crucial role in gene transcription related to cell proliferation. The activity of this pathway is tightly regulated. In the absence of an extracellular Wnt ligand, a cytoplasmic \"destruction complex,\" which includes the proteins Axin, Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3), and Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC), phosphorylates β-catenin. This phosphorylation marks β-catenin for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome, keeping its cytoplasmic levels low. When a Wnt ligand binds to its cell surface receptor complex (Frizzled/LRP5/6), the destruction complex is inactivated. Consequently, β-catenin is no longer phosphorylated, allowing it to accumulate in the cytoplasm, translocate to the nucleus, and activate the transcription of target genes.\n\nA particular type of colorectal cancer is characterized by a loss-of-function mutation in the *APC* gene. This mutation renders the APC protein non-functional, thereby disrupting the assembly and function of the destruction complex. This leads to constitutive, ligand-independent activation of the Wnt signaling pathway.\n\nA research team proposes a therapeutic strategy to treat these cancer cells by administering a high concentration of Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1). Dkk1 is a secreted protein that acts as an antagonist to the Wnt pathway by binding to the LRP5/6 co-receptor, thereby preventing the Wnt ligand from binding and initiating the signal.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome of treating this specific cancer cell line (with the non-functional APC) with Dkk1?\n\nA. Dkk1 will be an effective treatment, as it will block the Wnt receptor, allowing the restored destruction complex to degrade β-catenin and halt cell proliferation.\n\nB. Dkk1 will be ineffective because the mutation in APC is downstream of the Wnt receptor. The destruction complex cannot form properly, so β-catenin will accumulate regardless of the Wnt receptor's activation state.\n\nC. Dkk1 will bind directly to β-catenin in the cytoplasm, promoting its degradation through an alternative mechanism and thus reducing cancer cell proliferation.\n\nD. The treatment will be partially effective, as Dkk1 can still sequester some unbound Wnt ligand, leading to a moderate decrease in β-catenin levels.\n\nE. Dkk1 will hyper-activate the pathway, as the cancer cells have adapted to bypass the need for an active Wnt receptor, causing Dkk1 to trigger an opposing, pro-proliferative signal.", "solution": "We analyze the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway by identifying the regulatory logic and the relative positions of pathway components.\n\n1) In the absence of Wnt ligand:\n- The destruction complex, composed of APC, Axin, and GSK3, is functional. It phosphorylates β-catenin, marking it for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Thus, β-catenin levels remain low and target gene transcription is off.\n\n2) In the presence of Wnt ligand:\n- Wnt binds the Frizzled/LRP5/6 receptor complex, inactivating the destruction complex. Consequently, β-catenin is not phosphorylated, accumulates, translocates to the nucleus, and activates transcription of target genes.\n\n3) In APC loss-of-function cancer cells:\n- APC is a core component of the destruction complex. Loss of APC disrupts the assembly/function of the complex, so the phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin are impaired even in the absence of ligand. Therefore, β-catenin accumulates and drives gene transcription constitutively, independent of upstream receptor activity.\n\n4) Mechanism of Dkk1:\n- Dkk1 binds to LRP5/6 and prevents Wnt from engaging its receptor complex. This acts upstream to prevent ligand-induced inactivation of the destruction complex. Importantly, Dkk1 does not restore APC function and does not act directly on β-catenin. Its efficacy requires an intact, ligand-regulated destruction complex downstream.\n\n5) Predicting outcome in APC-null cells:\n- Because the critical defect lies downstream of the receptor at the level of the destruction complex, blocking Wnt-LRP5/6 interactions with Dkk1 does not reconstitute the destruction complex or restore β-catenin degradation. Thus, β-catenin will continue to accumulate and drive transcription regardless of receptor blockade.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect: Dkk1 cannot restore a nonfunctional APC or the destruction complex.\n- B is correct: the APC mutation is downstream of the receptor; the destruction complex remains defective, so β-catenin accumulates regardless of receptor activation.\n- C is incorrect: Dkk1 does not bind β-catenin.\n- D is incorrect: ligand sequestration upstream is irrelevant when the downstream degradation machinery is disabled; the pathway remains constitutively active.\n- E is incorrect: Dkk1 is an antagonist and does not hyper-activate the pathway.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2345630"}, {"introduction": "Modern cell biology moves beyond static diagrams to quantitatively measure dynamic molecular events within living cells.

The experiment involves tagging Axin with a donor fluorophore and β-catenin with an acceptor fluorophore.
