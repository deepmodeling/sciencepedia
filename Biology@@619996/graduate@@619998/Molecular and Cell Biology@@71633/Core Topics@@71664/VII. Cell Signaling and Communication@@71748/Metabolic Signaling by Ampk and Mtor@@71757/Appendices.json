The roles of LKB1, TSC2, Raptor, Rictor, AMPK, mTORC1, and mTORC2 as described are factually correct and represent the consensus in the field. The experimental design using glucose deprivation, oligomycin, insulin, and rapamycin is a standard methodology for studying this pathway.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The question is specific, asking to predict signaling patterns in defined genetic backgrounds under specific stimuli based on a given set of rules. A logical and unique set of predictions can be derived.\n-   **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective bias. All components are defined by their accepted biological names.\n\nThe problem statement is found to be valid. It is a rigorous, self-contained, and scientifically sound problem in molecular systems biology.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Evaluation\n\nWe will analyze the predicted consequences for each knockout line based on the provided principles.\n\n**1. LKB1 Knockout (KO)**\n-   **Pathway Role**: LKB1 is the principal upstream kinase that phosphorylates and activates AMPK at Thr172 in response to a high AMP/ATP ratio (energy stress).\n-   **Predicted Phenotype**: In the absence of LKB1, the activation of AMPK by energy stress (glucose deprivation and oligomycin) will be severely blunted. Consequently, phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr172 and its direct substrate ACC at Ser79 will be diminished. Since AMPK-mediated inhibition of mTORC1 (primarily via activation of TSC2) is lost, mTORC1 will remain inappropriately active despite cellular energy crisis. This leads to sustained phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1. As mTORC1 is a potent inhibitor of autophagy, its sustained activity will result in reduced autophagic flux compared to wild-type cells under the same stress. Rapamycin, an allosteric inhibitor of mTORC1, acts downstream of LKB1 and AMPK, so it should still effectively suppress mTORC1 signaling.\n\n**2. TSC2 Knockout (KO)**\n-   **Pathway Role**: TSC2 forms a complex with TSC1 that functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the small GTPase Rheb. By converting Rheb-GTP to inactive Rheb-GDP, the TSC1-TSC2 complex inhibits mTORC1.\n-   **Predicted Phenotype**: Loss of TSC2 leads to constitutive accumulation of active Rheb-GTP, resulting in chronically high mTORC1 activity. This hyperactivity is independent of upstream inhibitory signals from AMPK or activating signals from Akt, making mTORC1 refractory to regulation by energy status or growth factors. Therefore, under energy stress, AMPK will be activated, but it cannot inhibit mTORC1 because its target, TSC2, is absent. The sustained, high activity of mTORC1 and its substrate S6K1 will trigger the strong negative feedback loop mentioned in the problem statement. This feedback (e.g., via S6K1-mediated phosphorylation and inhibition of Insulin Receptor Substrate 1, IRS1) impairs upstream insulin signaling, leading to reduced activation of PI3K and consequently reduced phosphorylation of Akt at both Ser473 (by mTORC2) and Thr308 (by PDK1). As mTORC1 is constitutively active, autophagy is suppressed. Inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin would relieve this suppression and restore autophagic flux.\n\n**3. Raptor Knockout (KO)**\n-   **Pathway Role**: Raptor is an essential scaffolding protein required for the assembly and function of mTORC1. It mediates the interaction between mTOR and its substrates.\n-   **Predicted Phenotype**: In the absence of Raptor, a functional mTORC1 complex cannot be formed. This results in complete abrogation of mTORC1 signaling output, meaning phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 will be lost under all conditions. The elimination of S6K1 activity removes the negative feedback loop to the insulin signaling pathway. This relief of feedback is predicted to sensitize the cells to insulin, leading to enhanced PI3K-Akt signaling. Thus, insulin stimulation should cause a greater increase in phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 and Ser473 compared to wild-type cells. The loss of mTORC1, a major inhibitor of autophagy, will lead to constitutively elevated autophagic flux.\n\n**4. Rictor Knockout (KO)**\n-   **Pathway Role**: Rictor is the defining, essential scaffolding protein of the mTORC2 complex.\n-   **Predicted Phenotype**: Loss of Rictor leads to a non-functional mTORC2. Since mTORC2 is the kinase responsible for phosphorylating Akt at Ser473, this phosphorylation site will be unphosphorylated in Rictor KO cells. Full activation of Akt requires phosphorylation at both Ser473 and Thr308. Therefore, Akt activation will be incomplete. Reduced Akt activity means there is less inhibitory phosphorylation of TSC2, making the TSC1-TSC2 complex more active. This leads to increased hydrolysis of Rheb-GTP to Rheb-GDP, and consequently, reduced mTORC1 activity (lower p-S6K1 and p-4E-BP1). The lower mTORC1/S6K1 signaling, in turn, partially relieves the negative feedback loop on insulin signaling. This can lead to a compensatory increase in the upstream PI3K pathway, potentially enhancing PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308, even as Ser473 remains unphosphorylated.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. LKB1 knockout: diminished AMPK Thr172 and ACC Ser79 phosphorylation under energy stress, with failure to inhibit mTORC1 (S6K1 Thr389 and 4E-BP1 remain relatively high) and reduced autophagic flux; rapamycin still suppresses mTORC1. TSC2 knockout: constitutively high mTORC1 that is refractory to energy stress despite AMPK activation; reduced insulin-stimulated Akt Ser473 due to S6K1-mediated feedback; rapamycin restores autophagic flux. Raptor knockout: loss of mTORC1 outputs regardless of condition with enhanced autophagic flux; alleviated feedback increases insulin-stimulated Akt Thr308 and Ser473. Rictor knockout: loss of Akt Ser473 with incomplete Akt activation, leading to less inhibition of TSC2 and thus reduced mTORC1 output; partial relief of feedback increases Akt Thr308 without restoring Ser473.**\n-   This option perfectly matches the detailed predictions derived from first principles for all four knockout lines. Each statement accurately describes the direct consequences of the gene deletion and the subsequent network-level repercussions, including feedback loops and crosstalk.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. LKB1 knockout: AMPK is robustly activated by energy stress via Ca$^{2+}$/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase $2$ (CaMKK$2$), causing strong mTORC$1$ inhibition. TSC$2$ knockout: energy stress suppresses mTORC$1$ to wild-type levels. Raptor knockout: compensatory Rheb activation increases mTORC$1$ outputs. Rictor knockout: loss of mTORC$2$ hyperactivates Akt and thereby mTORC$1$.**\n-   The LKB1 KO description is incorrect; LKB1 is the major kinase for AMPK activation by energy stress (high AMP/ATP), and CaMKK2 is primarily a Ca$^{2+}$-dependent kinase that cannot fully compensate. The TSC2 KO description is incorrect; energy stress cannot suppress mTORC1 effectively without TSC2. The Raptor KO description is incorrect; mTORC1 is non-functional without Raptor. The Rictor KO description is incorrect; loss of mTORC2 impairs, not hyperactivates, Akt.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. LKB1 knockout: AMPK phosphorylation is abolished and mTORC$1$ assembly is also abolished because LKB1 is required for mTOR complex integrity. TSC$2$ knockout: mTORC$1$ activity is reduced because TSC2 normally promotes Rheb-GTP. Raptor knockout: no change in mTORC$1$ readouts because mTORC$1$ does not require Raptor. Rictor knockout: increased Akt Ser473 because of reduced competition for Akt by PDK$1$.**\n-   This option contains multiple fundamental errors. LKB1 is not required for mTORC1 assembly. TSC2 inactivates, not promotes, Rheb-GTP. Raptor is essential for mTORC1. Rictor is essential for Akt Ser473 phosphorylation, so this phosphorylation is lost, not increased.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. LKB1 knockout: AMPK is off at baseline and energy stress, yielding hyperactive mTORC$1$, but compensatory upregulation of CaMKK$2$ rapidly restores AMPK Thr172 under oligomycin and suppresses mTORC$1$. TSC$2$ knockout: AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of Raptor fully normalizes mTORC$1$ under energy stress. Raptor knockout: reduced feedback lowers Akt phosphorylation and decreases autophagy. Rictor knockout: mTORC$1$ increases due to loss of S6K$1$ feedback without changes to Akt Ser473.**\n-   This option makes several incorrect claims. A rapid compensatory restoration of AMPK activity in LKB1 KO is not the expected or typical phenotype. Phosphorylation of Raptor is a minor inhibitory input and cannot \"fully normalize\" mTORC1 in TSC2 KO cells. In Raptor KO, feedback is alleviated, which should increase Akt phosphorylation and increase autophagy. In Rictor KO, mTORC1 activity decreases, not increases.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the rigorous application of the provided principles, only option A provides a consistently correct and nuanced description of the expected experimental outcomes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2953828"}]}
