The final answer must be an ordered triple of exact fractional activations.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard model of ligand-receptor interaction based on the law of mass action, a fundamental principle in chemical kinetics and pharmacology. The premises are internally consistent: noncooperative single-site binding corresponds to a Hill coefficient of $n=1$, and the equivalence of $EC_{50}$ and the dissociation constant $K_d$ is a direct consequence of this model under the assumption of full efficacy. The data provided are sufficient and necessary to derive the requested expression and compute the specified values. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation begins from the law of mass action for the reversible binding of a ligand (forskolin, F) to a receptor (adenylyl cyclase, A) to form a complex (AF). The system is at equilibrium:\n$$ \\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{F} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{AF} $$\nThe dissociation constant, $K_d$, for this reaction is defined as:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{F}]}{[\\mathrm{AF}]} $$\nwhere $[\\mathrm{A}]$, $[\\mathrm{F}]$, and $[\\mathrm{AF}]$ are the equilibrium concentrations of the free receptor, free ligand, and receptor-ligand complex, respectively.\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is the fraction of total receptor sites that are bound by the ligand. The total concentration of receptor is $[\\mathrm{A}]_{\\text{total}} = [\\mathrm{A}] + [\\mathrm{AF}]$. Thus, the fractional occupancy is:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[\\mathrm{AF}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{AF}]}{[\\mathrm{A}] + [\\mathrm{AF}]} $$\nTo express $\\theta$ in terms of $[\\mathrm{F}]$ and $K_d$, we rearrange the dissociation constant expression to solve for $[\\mathrm{A}]$:\n$$ [\\mathrm{A}] = \\frac{K_d [\\mathrm{AF}]}{[\\mathrm{F}]} $$\nSubstituting this into the denominator of the expression for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[\\mathrm{AF}]}{\\frac{K_d [\\mathrm{AF}]}{[\\mathrm{F}]} + [\\mathrm{AF}]} $$\nThe term $[\\mathrm{AF}]$ is common to all terms and can be canceled, yielding:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[\\mathrm{F}]} + 1} $$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $[\\mathrm{F}]$ gives the standard form, known as the Langmuir isotherm or, in this context, the Hill equation for $n=1$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[\\mathrm{F}]}{K_d + [\\mathrm{F}]} $$\nThe problem states that catalytic activation is proportional to fractional occupancy with full efficacy. This means the fractional activation, $f([\\mathrm{F}])$, is equal to the fractional occupancy, $\\theta$.\n$$ f([\\mathrm{F}]) = \\theta = \\frac{[\\mathrm{F}]}{K_d + [\\mathrm{F}]} $$\nIt is also given that for this system, the dissociation constant $K_d$ is equal to the half-maximal effective concentration, $EC_{50}$. This is consistent, as setting $[\\mathrm{F}] = K_d$ in the equation yields $f(K_d) = \\frac{K_d}{K_d + K_d} = \\frac{1}{2}$, which is the definition of the half-maximal point. Substituting $EC_{50}$ for $K_d$, we arrive at the required expression for fractional activation:\n$$ f([\\mathrm{F}]) = \\frac{[\\mathrm{F}]}{EC_{50} + [\\mathrm{F}]} $$\nThis equation describes a hyperbolic relationship between $[\\mathrm{F}]$ and response. When plotted with the concentration axis on a logarithmic scale (a semi-log plot), the relationship produces a symmetric sigmoidal (S-shaped) curve, with an inflection point at $[\\mathrm{F}] = EC_{50}$, where $f([\\mathrm{F}]) = 0.5$.\n\nWe now evaluate this function using the given value $EC_{50} = 10~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ at the three specified concentrations of forskolin.
