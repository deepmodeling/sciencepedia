The model, while a simplification (a \"coarse-grained description\"), is a scientifically sound and widely used framework (the Hill-Langmuir model) for analyzing such systems. The biological context, TGF-β signaling, is appropriate. The problem is scientifically grounded.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem clearly defines all variables and provides the necessary relationships (dissociation constant, mass balance, definition of normalized output) to derive a unique solution. The goal is explicitly stated. The problem is well-posed.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The language is precise, quantitative, and devoid of subjective or ambiguous terminology. The problem is objective.\n4.  **Completeness**: The problem provides sufficient information.

No essential data is missing.\n5.  **Consistency**: The givens are internally consistent and do not lead to contradictions. The definitions are standard and compatible.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard, well-posed problem in quantitative biology that tests first principles. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe objective is to find an expression for the normalized signaling output, $y(L)$. By definition, $y(L)$ is the ratio of the actual signaling output to the maximum possible (saturating) output.\n\nThe problem states that the signaling output is proportional to the number of ligand-bound receptors, $R_L$. Let the proportionality constant be $k$.\n$$ \\text{Actual Output} = k \\cdot R_L $$\nThe saturating output occurs when the ligand concentration $L$ is very high ($L \\to \\infty$), at which point all receptors are occupied by the ligand. In this limit, the number of bound receptors $R_L$ approaches the total number of receptors $R_T$.\n$$ \\text{Saturating Output} = k \\cdot R_T $$\nThe normalized output $y(L)$ is therefore the ratio of these two quantities:\n$$ y(L) = \\frac{\\text{Actual Output}}{\\text{Saturating Output}} = \\frac{k \\cdot R_L}{k \\cdot R_T} = \\frac{R_L}{R_T} $$\nThe task is thus reduced to finding an expression for the fraction of bound receptors, $\\frac{R_L}{R_T}$, as a function of $L$ and $K_D$.\n\nTwo fundamental equations govern the system at steady state:\n1.  The receptor mass balance, which states that the total number of receptors $R_T$ is the sum of the free receptors $R$ and the ligand-bound receptors $R_L$.\n    $$ R_T = R + R_L $$\n2.  The equilibrium condition described by the dissociation constant $K_D$. As noted, for a system on a cell surface, we can relate the number of receptors and the ligand concentration.\n    $$ K_D = \\frac{R \\cdot L}{R_L} $$\nWe must now solve this system of two equations to express the ratio $\\frac{R_L}{R_T}$ in terms of $L$ and $K_D$.\n\nFrom the mass balance equation, we express the number of free receptors $R$ in terms of $R_T$ and $R_L$:\n$$ R = R_T - R_L $$\nSubstitute this expression for $R$ into the equation for the dissociation constant:\n$$ K_D = \\frac{(R_T - R_L) \\cdot L}{R_L} $$\nThe goal is to solve this equation for the fraction $\\frac{R_L}{R_T}$. We proceed with algebraic manipulation.\n$$ K_D \\cdot R_L = (R_T - R_L) \\cdot L $$\n$$ K_D \\cdot R_L = R_T \\cdot L - R_L \\cdot L $$\nNow, collect all terms containing $R_L$ on one side of the equation:\n$$ K_D \\cdot R_L + R_L \\cdot L = R_T \\cdot L $$\nFactor out $R_L$:\n$$ R_L (K_D + L) = R_T \\cdot L $$\nFinally, to obtain the desired fraction $\\frac{R_L}{R_T}$, we divide both sides by $R_T$ and by $(K_D + L)$:\n$$ \\frac{R_L}{R_T} = \\frac{L}{K_D + L} $$\nSince we established that $y(L) = \\frac{R_L}{R_T}$, the final expression for the normalized signaling output is:\n$$ y(L) = \\frac{L}{L + K_D} $$\nThis expression, known as the Hill-Langmuir equation, correctly describes the relationship between ligand concentration and fractional receptor occupancy (and thus normalized signaling) for a simple reversible binding process.

By reasoning through the probabilistic assembly of receptor complexes containing both functional and non-functional units, you will develop an intuition for the non-linear logic that governs TGF-β receptor activation and see how pathway stoichiometry can be as important as component function [@problem_id:2965490].", "problem": "A researcher engineers a cell line to study Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF-β) signaling. In these cells, Transforming Growth Factor Beta Receptor type I (TGFBR1) and Transforming Growth Factor Beta Receptor type II (TGFBR2) are present at steady-state plasma membrane levels that support canonical Mothers Against Decapentaplegic (SMAD) phosphorylation upon ligand stimulation. The researcher then overexpresses a kinase-dead TGFBR2 mutant (denote it as $R2^{KD}$), which retains normal extracellular ligand binding and TGFBR1-binding interfaces but lacks catalytic activity in its intracellular kinase domain. Wild-type TGFBR2 is denoted $R2^{WT}$. Let the fraction of total TGFBR2 that is kinase-dead be $f$, with $0 \\le f \\le 1$. The following widely accepted features of the pathway are assumed:\n- TGF-β is a dimer that engages two TGFBR2 molecules and recruits two TGFBR1 molecules to assemble a receptor heterotetramer of stoichiometry $2:2$ (two TGFBR2 and two TGFBR1).\n- Kinase activity of TGFBR2 is required only to phosphorylate TGFBR1; it is not required for ligand binding or heterotetramer assembly.\n- Ligand binding affinities of $R2^{WT}$ and $R2^{KD}$ are similar, and both recruit TGFBR1 with similar efficiency.\n- Phosphorylated TGFBR1 directly phosphorylates receptor-regulated SMADs (SMAD2/3), which then accumulate in the nucleus. The per-complex signaling output is proportional to the number of TGFBR1 subunits that become phosphorylated.\n- In a heterotetramer, each catalytically active TGFBR2 can phosphorylate one adjacent TGFBR1. A $R2^{KD}$ cannot phosphorylate any TGFBR1.\n- Receptor subunits mix randomly in complexes according to their membrane abundances, and ligand doses considered are: low dose, where $[L] \\ll K_d$ for receptor engagement, and saturating dose, where $[L] \\gg K_d$.\n\nUnder these assumptions, predict the consequences for heterotetramer assembly and downstream SMAD2/3 phosphorylation across ligand dose. Which option best captures the expected outcome as a function of $f$ and ligand concentration?\n\nA. Heterotetramers still assemble at both low and saturating ligand, with a statistical mixture of $R2^{WT}$ and $R2^{KD}$ in each $2:2$ complex. Because subunits mix randomly, the number of catalytically active TGFBR2 per complex follows a binomial distribution with $n=2$ and success probability $1-f$. Since each active TGFBR2 phosphorylates one TGFBR1, the mean number of activated TGFBR1 per complex is reduced by a factor of $(1-f)$ relative to wild type. Consequently, the SMAD2/3 phosphorylation dose–response is preserved in shape but scaled down in amplitude by approximately $(1-f)$ at all ligand doses; at saturating ligand, the maximal SMAD2/3 phosphorylation is reduced to about $(1-f)$ of control.\n\nB. Kinase activity of TGFBR2 is required for ligand-induced assembly; therefore, expression of kinase-dead TGFBR2 prevents heterotetramer formation altogether, abolishing SMAD2/3 phosphorylation at both low and saturating ligand, regardless of $f$.\n\nC. Kinase-dead TGFBR2 preferentially clusters receptors and stabilizes the heterotetramer, increasing the probability that TGFBR1 is phosphorylated by trans-kinase effects; thus, SMAD2/3 phosphorylation increases at low ligand and exceeds wild-type maximal levels at saturating ligand.\n\nD. At low ligand, wild-type TGFBR2 outcompetes kinase-dead TGFBR2 for ligand binding, so SMAD2/3 phosphorylation is unchanged; at saturating ligand, kinase-dead TGFBR2 dominates the complexes and completely eliminates SMAD2/3 phosphorylation for any $f > 0$.", "solution": "The problem statement must first be rigorously validated.\n\n**Step 1: Extraction of Givens**\n- A cell line is engineered with steady-state plasma membrane levels of TGFBR1 and TGFBR2.\n- A kinase-dead TGFBR2 mutant ($R2^{KD}$) is overexpressed, which lacks catalytic activity but retains normal ligand and TGFBR1 binding interfaces. Wild-type TGFBR2 is $R2^{WT}$.\n- The fraction of total TGFBR2 that is kinase-dead is $f$, where $0 \\le f \\le 1$.\n- Assumption 1: TGF-β ligand is a dimer, forming a $2:2$ heterotetramer with two TGFBR2 and two TGFBR1 molecules.\n- Assumption 2: TGFBR2 kinase activity is not required for ligand binding or heterotetramer assembly; it is only required for TGFBR1 phosphorylation.\n- Assumption 3: $R2^{WT}$ and $R2^{KD}$ have similar ligand binding affinities and recruit TGFBR1 with similar efficiency.\n- Assumption 4: Signaling output per complex is proportional to the number of phosphorylated TGFBR1 subunits. Phosphorylated TGFBR1 is responsible for phosphorylating downstream SMAD2/3.\n- Assumption 5: In a heterotetramer, one active TGFBR2 phosphorylates one TGFBR1. $R2^{KD}$ is catalytically inactive.\n- Assumption 6: Receptor subunits mix randomly in complexes based on their membrane abundances.\n- Ligand concentrations considered: low ($[L] \\ll K_d$) and saturating ($[L] \\gg K_d$).\n- The question is to predict the effect on heterotetramer assembly and SMAD2/3 phosphorylation as a function of $f$ and ligand dose.\n\n**Step 2: Validation of Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The model presented is a standard, simplified representation of dominant-negative inhibition in receptor tyrosine kinase (or serine/threonine kinase, as is the case here) signaling pathways. The concept of a kinase-dead mutant that can still assemble into a complex is a fundamental tool in molecular and cell biology. The assumptions are clearly stated and internally consistent. The problem is well-posed, objective, and can be formalized mathematically. It describes a realistic experimental scenario. It does not violate any fundamental principles of biology or chemistry.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the consequence of expressing a kinase-dead receptor, $R2^{KD}$, on the TGF-β signaling pathway. Let the fraction of $R2^{KD}$ be $f$ and the fraction of wild-type $R2^{WT}$ be $1-f$.\n\n**1. Heterotetramer Assembly**\nAccording to Assumption 2, the kinase activity of TGFBR2 is not required for the assembly of the $2:2$ heterotetramer. Assumption 3 states that both $R2^{WT}$ and $R2^{KD}$ have similar affinities for the ligand and for TGFBR1. Therefore, heterotetramers will continue to assemble at all ligand concentrations, and both wild-type and kinase-dead receptor variants will be incorporated into these complexes.\n\n**2. Probabilistic Composition of the Receptor Complex**\nA signaling complex contains two TGFBR2 subunits. Assumption 6 dictates that these subunits are chosen randomly from the membrane pool according to their abundance. The selection of two subunits for one complex can be modeled as two independent trials.\nThe probability of selecting an $R2^{WT}$ subunit is $p = 1-f$.\nThe probability of selecting an $R2^{KD}$ subunit is $q = f$.\n\nLet $X$ be the random variable representing the number of $R2^{WT}$ subunits in a single heterotetramer. $X$ follows a binomial distribution with number of trials $n=2$ and probability of success $p=1-f$. The probability mass function is given by $P(X=k) = \\binom{2}{k} (1-f)^k f^{2-k}$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n\nThe possible compositions of the TGFBR2 dimer within a complex are:\n- Two $R2^{WT}$ subunits: $X=2$. Probability $P(X=2) = (1-f)^2$.\n- One $R2^{WT}$ and one $R2^{KD}$ subunit: $X=1$. Probability $P(X=1) = 2(1-f)f$.\n- Two $R2^{KD}$ subunits: $X=0$. Probability $P(X=0) = f^2$.\n\n**3. Signaling Output per Complex**\nAssumption 4 states that the signaling output is proportional to the number of phosphorylated TGFBR1 subunits. Assumption 5 states that each active $R2^{WT}$ subunit phosphorylates one TGFBR1 subunit. Therefore, a complex containing $X$ subunits of $R2^{WT}$ will result in the phosphorylation of $X$ subunits of TGFBR1.\n\nTo find the overall effect on the cell, we must calculate the average signaling output per complex. This corresponds to the expected value of $X$. For a binomial distribution $B(n,p)$, the expected value is $E[X] = np$.\nIn this case, the average number of active $R2^{WT}$ subunits per complex is:\n$$E[X] = 2(1-f)$$\n\nIn a wild-type control cell, $f=0$. The number of active $R2^{WT}$ subunits is always $2$.\nThe signaling output in the engineered cells relative to the wild-type cells is the ratio of their average number of phosphorylated TGFBR1 subunits:\n$$\\text{Relative Signal} = \\frac{E[X]_{\\text{mutant}}}{E[X]_{\\text{wild-type}}} = \\frac{2(1-f)}{2} = 1-f$$\nThis means the average signaling potency of each individual receptor complex is reduced to a fraction $(1-f)$ of the wild-type potency.\n\n**4. Total Cellular Response**\nThe total cellular response (e.g., total amount of phosphorylated SMAD2/3) is the product of the number of active receptor complexes and the average signal per complex. The number of active complexes is a function of ligand concentration, $[L]$.\nAt any given $[L]$, let the number of formed complexes be $N([L])$.\nTotal Signal$_{\\text{wild-type}}([L]) \\propto N([L]) \\times 2$.\nTotal Signal$_{\\text{mutant}}([L]) \\propto N([L]) \\times 2(1-f)$.\n\nThe shape of the dose-response curve is determined by $N([L])$, which depends on ligand-receptor binding kinetics. Since the problem states that $R2^{WT}$ and $R2^{KD}$ have similar binding properties, the overall shape of the dose-response curve will be preserved. However, its amplitude (maximal response at saturating ligand) will be scaled down by the factor $(1-f)$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Heterotetramers still assemble at both low and saturating ligand, with a statistical mixture of $R2^{WT}$ and $R2^{KD}$ in each $2:2$ complex. Because subunits mix randomly, the number of catalytically active TGFBR2 per complex follows a binomial distribution with $n=2$ and success probability $1-f$. Since each active TGFBR2 phosphorylates one TGFBR1, the mean number of activated TGFBR1 per complex is reduced by a factor of $(1-f)$ relative to wild type. Consequently, the SMAD2/3 phosphorylation dose–response is preserved in shape but scaled down in amplitude by approximately $(1-f)$ at all ligand doses; at saturating ligand, the maximal SMAD2/3 phosphorylation is reduced to about $(1-f)$ of control.**\nThis option correctly states that heterotetramers assemble. It correctly identifies that the number of active receptors per complex follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n=2$ and $p=1-f$. It correctly deduces that the consequence is a scaling down of the signaling output by a factor of $(1-f)$. The final statement about the dose-response curve amplitude being reduced to $(1-f)$ of the control is a direct consequence of our derivation. The phrasing \"reduced by a factor of $(1-f)$\" is imprecise but clarified by the subsequent clause \"reduced to about $(1-f)$ of control\".\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Kinase activity of TGFBR2 is required for ligand-induced assembly; therefore, expression of kinase-dead TGFBR2 prevents heterotetramer formation altogether, abolishing SMAD2/3 phosphorylation at both low and saturating ligand, regardless of $f$.**\nThis statement directly contradicts Assumption 2, which explicitly states that kinase activity is *not* required for heterotetramer assembly.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Kinase-dead TGFBR2 preferentially clusters receptors and stabilizes the heterotetramer, increasing the probability that TGFBR1 is phosphorylated by trans-kinase effects; thus, SMAD2/3 phosphorylation increases at low ligand and exceeds wild-type maximal levels at saturating ligand.**\nThis statement contradicts multiple premises. It assumes preferential clustering, contrary to Assumption 6 (random mixing). It claims an increase in phosphorylation, which is impossible when introducing a catalytically inactive component ($R2^{KD}$) into the system. The maximal signal cannot exceed the wild-type case ($f=0$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. At low ligand, wild-type TGFBR2 outcompetes kinase-dead TGFBR2 for ligand binding, so SMAD2/3 phosphorylation is unchanged; at saturating ligand, kinase-dead TGFBR2 dominates the complexes and completely eliminates SMAD2/3 phosphorylation for any $f > 0$.**\nThe first part of this statement contradicts Assumption 3 (\"Ligand binding affinities of $R2^{WT}$ and $R2^{KD}$ are similar\"), so no such competition would occur. The second part is also incorrect; signaling is not \"completely eliminated\" for any $f > 0$. For any $f<1$, there is a non-zero probability of forming complexes containing at least one $R2^{WT}$, specifically $P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X=0) = 1 - f^2$. Thus, signaling persists, albeit at a reduced level.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2965490"}, {"introduction": "Biological systems are dynamic, constantly adapting to their environment.

A solution will be constructed.\n\nThe problem requires the numerical solution of a system of two coupled ordinary differential equations that model a negative feedback loop. The system is defined for time `$t \\ge 0$` with the new ligand level `$L_1$` as:\n$$\n\\frac{dX}{dt} = k_x \\frac{L_1}{1+\\alpha S} - \\gamma_x X\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{dt} = k_i (X - X_{\\mathrm{ref}}) - \\gamma_s S\n$$\nThe state of the system is given by the vector `$y(t) = [X(t), S(t)]^T$`.\n\nThe first step is to establish the initial conditions `$y(0) = [X(0), S(0)]^T$`. The problem states the system is initialized at the steady state corresponding to the ligand level `$L=L_0$`, with `$X(0) = X_{\\mathrm{ref}}$`.\nUsing the fixed parameters `$k_x=1.0$`, `$\\gamma_x=1.0$`, `$\\alpha=1.0$`, `$X_{\\mathrm{ref}}=1.0$` and the value `$L_0=1.0$` from the test suite, we calculate the initial concentration of the inhibitor `$S$`:\n$$\nS(0) = \\frac{k_x L_0}{\\alpha \\gamma_x X_{\\mathrm{ref}}} - \\frac{1}{\\alpha} = \\frac{1.0 \\cdot 1.0}{1.0 \\cdot 1.0 \\cdot 1.0} - \\frac{1}{1.0} = 1.0 - 1.0 = 0.0\n$$\nThus, for all specified test cases, the initial state vector is `$y(0) = [1.0, 0.0]^T$`.\n\nThe core task is to integrate the system of ODEs from `$t=0$` to `$t=T_{\\mathrm{final}}=200.0$` for each of the four parameter sets. This is a standard initial value problem (IVP) that can be solved numerically using appropriate scientific computing libraries. The `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` function from the SciPy library is a suitable tool for this purpose.\n\nWe define a function, say `model_rhs(t, y, params)`, which computes the right-hand side (the time derivatives `$[dX/dt, dS/dt]$`) of the ODE system for a given time `$t$`, state vector `$y=[X, S]$`, and a set of parameters.\n\nFor each test case, the following procedure is executed:\n1.  Assemble the parameters: fixed parameters `$k_x, \\gamma_x, \\alpha, X_{\\mathrm{ref}}$`, an updated ligand level `$L_1=4.0$`, and case-specific parameters `$k_i, \\gamma_s$`.\n2.  Define the initial state vector `$y_0 = [1.0, 0.0]$`.\n3.  Specify the integration time span `$[0, T_{\\mathrm{final}}]$`.\n4.  Invoke `solve_ivp` with the RHS function, time span, initial conditions, and parameters. The solver will compute the state trajectory `$y(t)$`. We are interested in the final state `$y(T_{\\mathrm{final}})$`.\n5.  Extract the final value of the active SMAD complex concentration, `$X(T_{\\mathrm{final}})$`.\n6.  Calculate the absolute deviation from the setpoint: `$|X(T_{\\mathrm{final}}) - X_{\\mathrm{ref}}|$`. This value is the result for the test case.\n\nWe can analyze the expected behavior for each case based on control theory principles.\n- Test A (`$\\gamma_s=0.0$`): The equation for S, `$\\frac{dS}{dt} = k_i (X - X_{\\mathrm{ref}})$`, represents a perfect integrator of the error `$X - X_{\\mathrm{ref}}$`. A fundamental property of integral control is that it drives the steady-state error to zero. Therefore, we expect `$X(t)` to adapt perfectly to the new ligand level `$L_1$`, returning to its setpoint `$X_{\\mathrm{ref}}$`. The final deviation `$|X(T_{\\mathrm{final}}) - X_{\\mathrm{ref}}|$` should be near zero, limited by numerical precision and the finite integration time.\n- Test B and C (`$\\gamma_s > 0.0$`): The term `$-\\gamma_s S$` introduces a \"leak\" to the integrator, making it a \"leaky integral\" controller. This prevents perfect adaptation, resulting in a non-zero steady-state error. The magnitude of this error depends on the leak rate `$\\gamma_s$`. The steady state `$X_{ss}$` for `$L=L_1$` is a solution to a quadratic equation derived from setting both derivatives to zero. A larger `$\\gamma_s$` (Test C) implies a leakier, less effective controller, and thus we expect a larger steady-state deviation compared to the smaller `$\\gamma_s$` of Test B.\n- Test D (`$k_i=0.0$`): The feedback loop is open because the controller gain `$k_i$` is zero. The dynamics of `$S$` become `$\\frac{dS}{dt} = -\\gamma_s S$`. With `$S(0)=0.0$`, `$S(t)` remains zero for all time. The system for `$X$` simplifies to `$\\frac{dX}{dt} = k_x L_1 - \\gamma_x X$`. The steady state is `$X_{ss} = \\frac{k_x L_1}{\\gamma_x} = \\frac{1.0 \\cdot 4.0}{1.0} = 4.0$`. The expected deviation is `$|X_{ss} - X_{\\mathrm{ref}}| = |4.0 - 1.0| = 3.0$`.\n\nThe implementation will follow this logic to generate the four required numerical results.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the TGF-beta signaling model for four different test cases\n    and computes the steady-state deviation of the output X from its setpoint.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Fixed Parameters ---\n    # These parameters are constant across all test cases as per the problem statement.\n    k_x = 1.0         # Production rate constant for X (dimensionless/time)\n    gamma_x = 1.0     # First-order decay rate for X (1/time)\n    alpha = 1.0       # Inhibition strength of S on X production (dimensionless)\n    X_ref = 1.0       # Setpoint for X concentration (dimensionless)\n    T_final = 200.0   # Final integration time (time)\n\n    # --- Test Case Definitions ---\n    # Each tuple contains parameters that vary between tests: (L0, L1, ki, gamma_s)\n    # L0: Initial ligand level (dimensionless)\n    # L1: Final ligand level (dimensionless)\n    # ki: Controller gain (1/time)\n    # gamma_s: First-order decay rate for S (1/time)\n    test_cases = [\n        # Test A: Integral control (perfect adaptation)\n        (1.0, 4.0, 1.0, 0.0),\n        # Test B: Leaky integral control (small leak)\n        (1.0, 4.0, 1.0, 0.01),\n        # Test C: Leaky integral control (large leak)\n        (1.0, 4.0, 1.0, 0.2),\n        # Test D: No feedback (open loop)\n        (1.0, 4.0, 0.0, 0.1),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    # --- ODE System Definition ---\n    def model_rhs(t, y, L, k_x, gamma_x, alpha, k_i, gamma_s, X_ref):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the right-hand side of the ODE system for the TGF-beta model.\n        y: state vector [X, S]\n        t: time\n        params: model parameters\n        \"\"\"\n        X, S = y\n        \n        # Ensure S is non-negative to avoid issues with the denominator,\n        # though it should not become negative with the given ICs.\n        S = max(0, S)\n\n        # dX/dt = kx * L / (1 + alpha*S) - gamma_x * X\n        dX_dt = k_x * L / (1.0 + alpha * S) - gamma_x * X\n        \n        # dS/dt = ki * (X - X_ref) - gamma_s * S\n        dS_dt = k_i * (X - X_ref) - gamma_s * S\n        \n        return [dX_dt, dS_dt]\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        L0, L1, k_i, gamma_s = case\n\n        # --- Initial Conditions ---\n        # The system is at steady state for L=L0, with X(0)=X_ref.\n        # From problem statement S(0) = (k_x * L0 / (alpha * gamma_x * X_ref)) - (1 / alpha)\n        # With L0=1.0 and fixed parameters, S(0) = 0.0 for all cases.\n        X0 = X_ref\n        S0 = (k_x * L0 / (alpha * gamma_x * X_ref)) - (1.0 / alpha)\n        y0 = [X0, S0]\n\n        # --- Numerical Integration ---\n        # The system is integrated from t=0 to t=T_final after the step to L=L1.\n        t_span = [0, T_final]\n        \n        # We need the solution at the final time point to check the steady state.\n        # Using solve_ivp is robust for this type of problem.\n        # We pass the changing parameters (L1, ki, gamma_s) via the 'args' tuple.\n        solution = solve_ivp(\n            fun=model_rhs,\n            t_span=t_span,\n            y0=y0,\n            method='RK45',  # Standard robust solver\n            args=(L1, k_x, gamma_x, alpha, k_i, gamma_s, X_ref),\n            dense_output=False,\n            rtol=1e-8,\n            atol=1e-8\n        )\n        \n        # Extract the final value of X\n        X_final = solution.y[0, -1]\n        \n        # --- Calculate Final Deviation ---\n        # Compute the absolute deviation of the final X from the setpoint X_ref.\n        deviation = abs(X_final - X_ref)\n        results.append(deviation)\n\n    # --- Final Output Formatting ---\n    # The output must be a single line with comma-separated values\n    # rounded to exactly six decimal places, enclosed in brackets.\n    formatted_results = [f\"{r:.6f}\" for r in results]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2965428"}]}
