It is an objective problem based on the principles of chemical reaction stoichiometry. No flaws are identified.\n\nThe task is to determine the maximum possible concentration of free $G\\beta\\gamma$ that can be produced. This is a straightforward limiting reactant problem, framed in a biochemical context. The net reaction, which is catalyzed by the agonist-bound receptor, can be written as:\n$$G\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\cdot\\mathrm{GDP} + \\mathrm{GTP} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Catalyst: } R} G\\alpha\\cdot\\mathrm{GTP} + G\\beta\\gamma$$\nThe receptor, $R$, is a catalyst. Its concentration, given as $[R]_0 = 0.15 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{M}$, influences the rate of the reaction but not the final yield. Since we are asked for the maximum possible concentration of a product, we are interested in the reaction's endpoint, where it has proceeded to completion as dictated by the initial amount of reactants. Thus, the concentration of the catalyst is irrelevant information for this specific calculation.\n\nThe reaction consumes two species: the heterotrimeric G protein, $G\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\cdot\\mathrm{GDP}$, and guanosine triphosphate, GTP. Their initial concentrations are provided:\n$$[G\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\cdot\\mathrm{GDP}]_0 = 0.80 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\n$$[\\mathrm{GTP}]_0 = 0.50 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nThe stoichiometry of the reaction indicates that one molecule of $G\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\cdot\\mathrm{GDP}$ reacts with one molecule of GTP. This corresponds to a reactant molar ratio of $1:1$.\n\nTo find the limiting reactant, we must compare the initial molar concentrations of the reactants. We directly compare $[\\mathrm{GTP}]_0$ and $[G\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\cdot\\mathrm{GDP}]_0$:\n$$0.50 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{M}  0.80 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nThis inequality shows that $[\\mathrm{GTP}]_0  [G\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\cdot\\mathrm{GDP}]_0$.
