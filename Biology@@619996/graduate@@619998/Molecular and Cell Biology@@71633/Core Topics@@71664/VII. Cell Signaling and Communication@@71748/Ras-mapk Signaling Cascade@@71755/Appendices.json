This phenomenon arises when the enzymes operate in their saturated, or zero-order, kinetic regimes.\nThe kinase, MEK, acts on inactive ERK, whose dimensionless concentration is $1-R$. MEK is saturated when its substrate concentration is much greater than its Michaelis constant, i.e., $S_{T}(1-R) \\gg K_{m,1}$. In dimensionless terms, this is $1-R \\gg K_1$.\nThe phosphatase, DUSP, acts on active ERK, whose dimensionless concentration is $R$. DUSP is saturated when $S_{T}R \\gg K_{m,2}$, which in dimensionless terms is $R \\gg K_2$.\nFor both enzymes to be simultaneously saturated, the system must satisfy $K_1 \\ll 1-R$ and $K_2 \\ll R$. This is possible only if $R$ is not close to $0$ or $1$, which in turn requires the dimensionless Michaelis parameters to be small compared to $1$:\n$$ K_{1} \\ll 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad K_{2} \\ll 1 $$\nUnder these conditions, the rate laws approximate to zero-order kinetics over a significant range of $R$.\nWhen $1-R \\gg K_1$, the forward rate $v_1(R) = \\frac{V_1(1-R)}{K_1+1-R} \\approx \\frac{V_1(1-R)}{1-R} = V_1$.\nWhen $R \\gg K_2$, the reverse rate $v_2(R) = \\frac{V_2 R}{K_2+R} \\approx \\frac{V_2 R}{R} = V_2$.\nAt steady state, $v_1 \\approx v_2$, which implies $V_1 \\approx V_2$. This establishes the region where the system response is most sensitive.\nIf $V_1 < V_2$, the net dephosphorylation rate is high, driving the system to a state where $R^{\\ast}$ is very small. In this OFF state, the DUSP is no longer saturated ($R^{\\ast} \\sim K_2$), but MEK remains saturated. The rates balance at a low $R^{\\ast}$ value.\nIf $V_1 > V_2$, the net phosphorylation rate is high, driving the system to a state where $R^{\\ast}$ is close to $1$. In this ON state, MEK is no longer saturated ($(1-R^{\\ast}) \\sim K_1$), but DUSP is saturated. The rates balance at a high $R^{\\ast}$ value.\nThe transition between the OFF state ($R^{\\ast} \\approx 0$) and the ON state ($R^{\\ast} \\approx 1$) occurs over a very narrow range of the stimulus (e.g., $V_1$) centered around the point $V_1 = V_2$. This sharp, switch-like transition is the hallmark of zero-order ultrasensitivity.\nIn summary, the parameter regime for order-$0$ ultrasensitivity is characterized by:\n1.  $K_1 \\ll 1$ and $K_2 \\ll 1$: Both enzymes have the potential to be saturated by their respective substrates, as their Michaelis constants are much smaller than the total substrate concentration $S_T$.\n2.  $V_1$ is comparable to $V_2$: The switching behavior is centered around the point where the maximal enzymatic capacities are balanced.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{V_{2}(1+K_{1}) - V_{1}(1-K_{2}) - \\sqrt{\\left(V_{1}(1-K_{2}) - V_{2}(1+K_{1})\\right)^2 - 4V_{1}K_{2}(V_{2}-V_{1})}}{2(V_{2}-V_{1})}}$$", "id": "2961613"}, {"introduction": "Once activated in the cytoplasm, a primary function of phosphorylated ERK (pERK) is to translocate into the nucleus and orchestrate changes in gene expression.
