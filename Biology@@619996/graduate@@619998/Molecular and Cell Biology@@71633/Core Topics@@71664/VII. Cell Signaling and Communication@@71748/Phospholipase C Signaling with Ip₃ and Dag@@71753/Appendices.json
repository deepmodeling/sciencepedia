No flaws listed in the validation criteria are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe dynamics of the concentration of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, denoted as $[\\mathrm{IP}_3]$, in a well-mixed compartment can be described by a mass-balance ordinary differential equation. The rate of change of $[\\mathrm{IP}_3]$ is the sum of its production rate and its removal rate.\n\nThe production of $[\\mathrm{IP}_3]$ is given as a constant flux, $J_p$. This term represents the rate of increase of concentration.\nThe removal of $[\\mathrm{IP}_3]$ follows first-order kinetics, which means its rate is proportional to the current concentration. This rate is given by $-k_d [\\mathrm{IP}_3]$, where $k_d$ is the first-order rate constant. The negative sign indicates a decrease in concentration.\n\nCombining these terms, the mass-balance ODE for $[\\mathrm{IP}_3](t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\mathrm{IP}_3]}{dt} = J_p - k_d [\\mathrm{IP}_3]\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the steady-state concentration, $[\\mathrm{IP}_3]^{\\ast}$. At steady state, the concentration of $[\\mathrm{IP}_3]$ is constant, meaning its time derivative is zero.\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\mathrm{IP}_3]^{\\ast}}{dt} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this condition into our ODE gives:\n$$\n0 = J_p - k_d [\\mathrm{IP}_3]^{\\ast}\n$$\nSolving this algebraic equation for $[\\mathrm{IP}_3]^{\\ast}$ yields the expression for the steady-state concentration:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{IP}_3]^{\\ast} = \\frac{J_p}{k_d}\n$$\n\nThe third task is to derive the local sensitivity of the steady-state concentration with respect to the production flux, $\\frac{d[\\mathrm{IP}_3]^{\\ast}}{dJ_p}$, while holding the degradation rate constant $k_d$ fixed. We differentiate the expression for $[\\mathrm{IP}_3]^{\\ast}$ with respect to $J_p$:\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\mathrm{IP}_3]^{\\ast}}{dJ_p} = \\frac{d}{dJ_p} \\left( \\frac{J_p}{k_d} \\right)\n$$\nSince $k_d$ is treated as a constant, the differentiation is straightforward:\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\mathrm{IP}_3]^{\\ast}}{dJ_p} = \\frac{1}{k_d}\n$$\nThis result indicates that the sensitivity of the steady-state concentration to changes in production flux is inversely proportional to the degradation rate constant. A faster degradation rate (larger $k_d$) leads to a lower sensitivity.\n\nFinally, we evaluate these two expressions using the provided numerical values: $J_p = 0.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $k_d = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nThe steady-state concentration is:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{IP}_3]^{\\ast} = \\frac{0.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.05\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\n$$\nThe value is $2$.\n\nThe local sensitivity is:\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\mathrm{IP}_3]^{\\ast}}{dJ_p} = \\frac{1}{0.05\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe value is $20$.\n\nThe units are consistent with the problem statement: $[\\mathrm{IP}_3]^{\\ast}$ is in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and the sensitivity, $\\frac{d[\\mathrm{IP}_3]^{\\ast}}{dJ_p}$, has units of $\\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\mathrm{s}$.

This leads to:\n    -   Depletion of $PIP_2$: PH-$\\mathrm{PLC\\delta1}$-GFP translocates from the membrane to the cytosol (fact (v)).\n    -   Production of $DAG$: C1a-PKC$\\delta$-mCherry translocates from the cytosol to the membrane (fact (vi)).\n    -   Production of $IP_3$: $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ is released from the ER, increasing cytosolic $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ concentration and GCaMP$6\\mathrm{f}$ fluorescence (facts (iv) and (vii)).\n\nA successful discriminatory experiment must target unique upstream components of each pathway. For the carbachol pathway, a specific inhibitor of $\\mathrm{G\\alpha_q}$ is ideal. For the EGF pathway, an inhibitor of the EGFR kinase or a method to block the EGFR-$\\mathrm{PLC\\gamma}$ interaction (e.g., by mutating the SH2 domains of $\\mathrm{PLC\\gamma}$) is appropriate.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Pre-incubate cells for $15$ minutes with YM-$254890$ at $100\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ (a selective $\\mathrm{G\\alpha_q}$ inhibitor) or with AG$1478$ at $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ (an EGFR kinase inhibitor), and in a separate condition express an SH2-disabled $\\mathrm{PLC\\gamma1}$ mutant that cannot bind phosphotyrosines on EGFR. Stimulate with carbachol at $10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ or EGF at $50\\,\\mathrm{ng\\,mL^{-1}}$ in separate trials. Predictions: in control cells, either ligand causes PH-$\\mathrm{PLC\\delta1}$ to leave the membrane ($PIP_2$ depletion), C1a to translocate to the membrane ($DAG$ increase), and GCaMP$6\\mathrm{f}$ to brighten ($\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ rise). With YM-$254890$, carbachol responses are ablated across all three sensors, whereas EGF responses persist. With AG$1478$, EGF responses are ablated while carbachol responses persist. With the SH2-disabled $\\mathrm{PLC\\gamma1}$, EGF responses are strongly reduced or absent, while carbachol responses are unchanged.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: This option proposes a logical and well-designed experiment.\n    -   The use of YM-$254890$ selectively targets $\\mathrm{G\\alpha_q}$, which is the specific activator of $\\mathrm{PLC\\beta}$ in the carbachol pathway, according to fact (i). Therefore, it should block carbachol-induced signaling without affecting the EGF pathway. The prediction is correct.\n    -   The use of AG$1478$ selectively targets the EGFR kinase. This prevents EGFR autophosphorylation, which is the necessary first step for $\\mathrm{PLC\\gamma}$ recruitment and activation in the EGF pathway. It should not affect the GPCR-mediated pathway. The prediction is correct.\n    -   Expressing an SH2-disabled $\\mathrm{PLC\\gamma1}$ mutant directly targets the interaction specified in fact (ii). Without functional SH2 domains, $\\mathrm{PLC\\gamma}$ cannot be recruited to the activated EGFR and thus cannot be activated by EGF. This will ablate the EGF signal without affecting the carbachol pathway, which uses endogenous $\\mathrm{PLC\\beta}$. The prediction is correct.\n    -   The baseline prediction for control cells is also correct, as both pathways converge on $PIP_2$ hydrolysis.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Pre-incubate cells overnight with pertussis toxin at $200\\,\\mathrm{ng\\,mL^{-1}}$ to inhibit $\\mathrm{G_i/G_o}$ and for $15$ minutes with AG$1478$ at $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. Predictions: pertussis toxin eliminates carbachol-evoked PH-$\\mathrm{PLC\\delta1}$ translocation, C1a membrane recruitment, and GCaMP$6\\mathrm{f}$ signals, whereas EGF responses are unaffected; AG$1478$ attenuates both carbachol- and EGF-evoked biosensor changes because EGFR transactivation is required for full $\\mathrm{PLC\\beta}$ activation.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: This option contains a fundamental error in its premise. The M1 receptor is a $\\mathrm{G_q}$-coupled GPCR. Pertussis toxin catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of $\\mathrm{G\\alpha}$ subunits of the $\\mathrm{G_i/G_o}$ family, preventing their activation. It has no effect on G proteins of the $\\mathrm{G_q}$ family. Therefore, the prediction that pertussis toxin eliminates carbachol-evoked signals is incorrect. The reasoning for AG$1478$ effect on carbachol response invokes EGFR transactivation, a mechanism of pathway cross-talk not included in the problem's stated \"fundamental facts\" and thus outside the scope of reasoning for this problem.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Pre-treat with the pan-PLC inhibitor U$73122$ at $5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ or its inactive analog U$73343$ as control. Predictions: U$73122$ selectively abolishes EGF-evoked PH-$\\mathrm{PLC\\delta1}$ and C1a translocations and GCaMP$6\\mathrm{f}$ signals while sparing carbachol-evoked biosensor responses because $\\mathrm{PLC\\beta}$ can be driven by $\\mathrm{G\\beta\\gamma}$ in a U$73122$-resistant manner; U$73343$ has no effect.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: This option makes an incorrect claim about pharmacology. U$73122$ is known as a general, or pan-isoform, inhibitor of phospholipase C. It is not selective for $\\mathrm{PLC\\gamma}$ over $\\mathrm{PLC\\beta}$. Therefore, it would be expected to inhibit the responses to both carbachol and EGF. The additional justification involving $\\mathrm{G\\beta\\gamma}$-driven, U$73122$-resistant activation of $\\mathrm{PLC\\beta}$ is a complex and non-canonical claim that contradicts the simpler, direct activation by $\\mathrm{G\\alpha_q}$ specified in fact (i) and is not a generally accepted mechanism, especially regarding U$73122$ resistance.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Co-express the C-terminus of G protein-coupled receptor kinase $2$ (GRK$2\\mathrm{ct}$) to scavenge $\\mathrm{G\\beta\\gamma}$ and a $\\mathrm{PLC\\gamma1}$ mutant lacking its Src Homology 3 (SH3) domain, without any receptor kinase or $\\mathrm{G\\alpha_q}$ inhibitors. Predictions: GRK$2\\mathrm{ct}$ eliminates carbachol-evoked PH-$\\mathrm{PLC\\delta1}$ and C1a translocations and GCaMP$6\\mathrm{f}$ signals, while the SH3-lacking $\\mathrm{PLC\\gamma1}$ abolishes EGF-evoked biosensor responses; thus, carbachol maps to $\\mathrm{PLC\\beta}$ and EGF to $\\mathrm{PLC\\gamma}$.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: This option misidentifies the critical mediators for both pathways based on the given facts.\n    -   The prediction that scavenging $\\mathrm{G\\beta\\gamma}$ with GRK$2\\mathrm{ct}$ eliminates the carbachol response is flawed. Fact (i) explicitly states that $\\mathrm{PLC\\beta}$ is activated by $\\mathrm{G\\alpha_q}$, not $\\mathrm{G\\beta\\gamma}$. While some $\\mathrm{PLC\\beta}$ isoforms can be co-activated by $\\mathrm{G\\beta\\gamma}$, the primary activator downstream of $\\mathrm{G_q}$ is $\\mathrm{G\\alpha_q}$, so eliminating the response by scavenging $\\mathrm{G\\beta\\gamma}$ is an incorrect prediction.\n    -   The prediction that deleting the SH3 domain of $\\mathrm{PLC\\gamma1}$ abolishes the EGF response is also flawed. Fact (ii) identifies the tandem SH2 domains as critical for recruitment to the activated RTK. The SH3 domain is involved in other protein-protein interactions and is not the primary determinant for activation by EGFR. Deleting the SH3 domain would not be expected to abolish the response.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2959027"}]}
