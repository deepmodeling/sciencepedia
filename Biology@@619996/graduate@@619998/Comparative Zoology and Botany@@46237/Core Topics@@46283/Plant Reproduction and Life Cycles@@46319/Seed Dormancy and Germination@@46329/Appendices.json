Empirical studies show that, between a lower base temperature $T_b$ and an optimum temperature $T_o$, the progress toward germination is well approximated by linear thermal accumulation: at any instant, only temperature above the base contributes to development, and the development proceeds when the accumulated thermal exposure reaches a lot- and percentile-specific requirement. Specifically, assume the following foundational principles:\n- Below the base temperature $T_b$, no developmental progress toward germination occurs (developmental rate is zero).\n- For $T_b < T < T_o$ under constant temperature $T$, the instantaneous accumulation rate of a thermal progress variable $\\Theta(t)$ is proportional to the temperature excess above base, with proportionality coefficient equal to one by definition of thermal time, so that $\\mathrm{d}\\Theta/\\mathrm{d}t$ equals the temperature excess above $T_b$.\n- The $g$-th percentile of seeds germinates when the accumulated thermal progress variable first reaches a threshold $\\theta_T(g)$ that is characteristic of that percentile in the lot.\n\nUsing only these assumptions and no additional shortcut formulas, derive a closed-form expression for the time to the $g$-th percentile of germination, denoted $t_g$, as a function of $T$, $T_b$, and $\\theta_T(g)$, valid for $T_b < T < T_o$.

The model is applicable for a constant incubation temperature $T$ within the suboptimal range, defined as $T_b < T < T_o$, where $T_b$ is the base temperature and $T_o$ is the optimum temperature.\n\nFirst, we must validate the problem statement.\n\nThe givens are:\n1.  A constant incubation temperature $T$ where $T_b < T < T_o$.\n2.  The base temperature is $T_b$. Below this temperature, developmental rate is zero.\n3.  The thermal progress variable is $\\Theta(t)$.\n4.  The rate of accumulation of thermal progress is given by the differential equation $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\Theta}{\\mathrm{d}t} = T - T_b$.\n5.  The germination condition for the $g$-th percentile of the seed lot is that the accumulated thermal progress $\\Theta(t)$ reaches a threshold value $\\theta_T(g)$.\n6.  The time to germination for the $g$-th percentile is denoted $t_g$.\n7.  The units for $\\theta_T(g)$ are degree-days and for temperature are degrees Celsius. The resulting time $t_g$ must be in days.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, utilizing the standard thermal time (or degree-day) model, which is a well-established concept in agricultural science and ecology. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary conditions to find a unique solution. The parameters and variables are clearly defined within the context of the model. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental relationship provided is the ordinary differential equation governing the accumulation of thermal progress $\\Theta$ with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\Theta}{\\mathrm{d}t} = T - T_b\n$$\nThis equation is valid under the condition of a constant temperature $T$ such that $T > T_b$.\n\nTo find the total accumulated thermal progress up to a certain time $t$, we must integrate this rate equation. We assume that at the beginning of the incubation period, at $t=0$, no thermal progress has yet been accumulated. This gives us the initial condition $\\Theta(0) = 0$.\n\nWe can solve the differential equation by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\Theta = (T - T_b) \\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial state $(t=0, \\Theta=0)$ to a general state $(t, \\Theta(t))$ yields:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\Theta(t)} \\mathrm{d}\\Theta' = \\int_{0}^{t} (T - T_b) \\mathrm{d}t'\n$$\nSince $T$ and $T_b$ are constants for the duration of the experiment, the term $(T - T_b)$ is a constant and can be moved outside the integral on the right-hand side.\n$$\n[\\Theta']_{0}^{\\Theta(t)} = (T - T_b) [t']_{0}^{t}\n$$\nEvaluating the integrals gives the expression for the accumulated thermal progress at any time $t$:\n$$\n\\Theta(t) - 0 = (T - T_b) (t - 0)\n$$\n$$\n\\Theta(t) = (T - T_b) t\n$$\nThis equation shows that for a constant temperature above the base temperature, thermal time accumulates linearly with chronological time.\n\nThe problem states that the $g$-th percentile of the seed lot germinates at a specific time $t_g$ when the accumulated thermal progress $\\Theta(t_g)$ reaches the threshold value $\\theta_T(g)$. We can express this condition as:\n$$\n\\Theta(t_g) = \\theta_T(g)\n$$\nBy substituting our derived expression for $\\Theta(t)$ at $t=t_g$ into this condition, we get:\n$$\n(T - T_b) t_g = \\theta_T(g)\n$$\nOur goal is to find the expression for $t_g$. Since the problem is defined for $T > T_b$, the term $(T - T_b)$ is a positive non-zero constant. We can therefore isolate $t_g$ by dividing both sides by $(T - T_b)$:\n$$\nt_g = \\frac{\\theta_T(g)}{T - T_b}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the time to germination for the $g$-th percentile.\n\nA check of the physical units provides further validation. The thermal time requirement $\\theta_T(g)$ is given in units of degree-days (e.g., $\\text{°C} \\cdot \\text{days}$). The temperatures $T$ and $T_b$ are in degrees Celsius ($\\text{°C}$), so their difference $(T - T_b)$ is also in degrees Celsius. The units of the expression for $t_g$ are:\n$$\n\\text{units of } t_g = \\frac{\\text{units of } \\theta_T(g)}{\\text{units of } (T - T_b)} = \\frac{\\text{°C} \\cdot \\text{days}}{\\text{°C}} = \\text{days}\n$$\nThe resulting unit is days, which is a unit of time, as expected and required.\n\nFinally, the biological meaning of the key parameters within this framework is as follows:\n- $T_b$ (Base Temperature): This represents the theoretical minimum temperature threshold for any developmental progress toward germination. Below this temperature, the organism's metabolic processes are assumed to be arrested, and no progress toward germination occurs, regardless of how much time passes.\n- $T_o$ (Optimum Temperature): This is the temperature at which the rate of development is maximal. The linear model $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\Theta}{\\mathrm{d}t} = T - T_b$ is an approximation that holds only for the suboptimal temperature range $T_b < T < T_o$. Beyond $T_o$, the developmental rate typically starts to decrease due to heat stress.\n- $\\theta_T(g)$ (Thermal Time Requirement): This parameter quantifies the total amount of accumulated thermal progress (a physiological time scale) that must be experienced by a seed for it to complete the germination process. The fact that it is a function of the percentile $g$ accounts for the inherent biological variability within the seed population; 'faster' seeds (lower $g$) have a smaller $\\theta_T(g)$ and require less thermal accumulation to germinate than 'slower' seeds (higher $g$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\theta_T(g)}{T - T_b}}\n$$", "id": "2608938"}, {"introduction": "Real-world germination is governed by multiple environmental cues, with water availability being as critical as temperature.

A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Analysis of Steady States**\nA steady state $(A^{*}, G^{*})$ of the system is a point where the time derivatives are zero. To find the steady states, we set $\\frac{dA}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dG}{dt} = 0$:\n$$\ns_{A} - d_{A}A^{*} - k_{AG}A^{*}G^{*} = 0\n$$\n$$\ns_{G} - d_{G}G^{*} - k_{GA}G^{*}A^{*} = 0\n$$\nThese equations define the nullclines of the system. For a positive steady state, we must have $A^{*} > 0$ and $G^{*} > 0$.\n\nWe can express the nullclines as functions of $A$ in the $A$-$G$ plane.\nThe $A$-nullcline (where $\\frac{dA}{dt} = 0$) is given by:\n$s_{A} = A(d_{A} + k_{AG}G)$\nFor $A > 0$, we can solve for $G$:\n$G_{A}(A) = \\frac{s_{A}}{k_{AG}A} - \\frac{d_{A}}{k_{AG}}$\nThis is a monotonically decreasing function for $A > 0$. It intersects the $A$-axis ($G=0$) at $A = \\frac{s_A}{d_A}$ and has a vertical asymptote at $A=0$.\n\nThe $G$-nullcline (where $\\frac{dG}{dt} = 0$) is given by:\n$s_{G} = G(d_{G} + k_{GA}A)$\nSolving for $G$:\n$G_{G}(A) = \\frac{s_{G}}{d_{G} + k_{GA}A}$\nThis is also a monotonically decreasing function for $A > 0$. As $A \\to 0$, $G \\to \\frac{s_G}{d_G}$. As $A \\to \\infty$, $G \\to 0$.\n\nA positive steady state is an intersection of these two nullclines in the first quadrant ($A>0, G>0$). Let us examine their behavior. As $A \\to 0^{+}$, $G_{A}(A) \\to \\infty$ while $G_{G}(A)$ approaches the finite positive value $\\frac{s_{G}}{d_{G}}$. Thus, for sufficiently small positive $A$, $G_{A}(A) > G_{G}(A)$.\nAs $A \\to \\infty$, $G_{A}(A)$ approaches the negative value $-\\frac{d_{A}}{k_{AG}}$, while $G_{G}(A)$ approaches $0$ from above. Thus, for sufficiently large $A$, $G_{A}(A)  G_{G}(A)$.\nSince both $G_{A}(A)$ and $G_{G}(A)$ are continuous functions for $A>0$, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees at least one intersection point. Because both functions are strictly decreasing, they can intersect at most once. Therefore, there exists exactly one positive steady state.\nThe existence of a unique positive steady state immediately precludes the possibility of bistability, which requires at least two stable steady states.\n\n**Algebraic Solution for the Unique Steady State**\nWe can solve the system of algebraic equations for the steady state $(A^{*}, G^{*})$. From the first equation, $G^{*} = \\frac{s_{A} - d_{A}A^{*}}{k_{AG}A^{*}}$. Substituting this into the second equation:\n$s_{G} - d_{G}\\left(\\frac{s_{A} - d_{A}A^{*}}{k_{AG}A^{*}}\\right) - k_{GA}A^{*}\\left(\\frac{s_{A} - d_{A}A^{*}}{k_{AG}A^{*}}\\right) = 0$\n$s_{G} - \\frac{d_{G}s_{A}}{k_{AG}A^{*}} + \\frac{d_{G}d_{A}}{k_{AG}} - \\frac{k_{GA}(s_{A} - d_{A}A^{*})}{k_{AG}} = 0$\nMultiplying by $k_{AG}A^{*}$ to clear the denominator:\n$s_{G}k_{AG}A^{*} - d_{G}s_{A} + d_{A}d_{G}A^{*} - k_{GA}s_{A}A^{*} + k_{GA}d_{A}(A^{*})^{2} = 0$\nRearranging into a standard quadratic form $a(A^{*})^2 + bA^{*} + c = 0$:\n$(d_{A}k_{GA})(A^{*})^{2} + (s_{G}k_{AG} + d_{A}d_{G} - s_{A}k_{GA})A^{*} - s_{A}d_{G} = 0$\nThe coefficient of the quadratic term, $a = d_{A}k_{GA}$, is strictly positive. The constant term, $c = -s_{A}d_{G}$, is strictly negative. The product of the roots of this quadratic equation is $\\frac{c}{a}$, which is negative. This implies that one root is positive and one root is negative. Since concentration must be non-negative, there is a unique physically meaningful solution for $A^{*}$. Using the quadratic formula and selecting the positive root:\n$A^{*} = \\frac{-(s_{G}k_{AG} + d_{A}d_{G} - s_{A}k_{GA}) + \\sqrt{(s_{G}k_{AG} + d_{A}d_{G} - s_{A}k_{GA})^{2} + 4(d_{A}k_{GA})(s_{A}d_{G})}}{2d_{A}k_{GA}}$\n\nA symmetric derivation can be performed for $G^{*}$. Starting from $A^{*} = \\frac{s_{G} - d_{G}G^{*}}{k_{GA}G^{*}}$, we obtain the quadratic equation for $G^{*}$:\n$(d_{G}k_{AG})(G^{*})^{2} + (s_{A}k_{GA} + d_{A}d_{G} - s_{G}k_{AG})G^{*} - s_{G}d_{A} = 0$\nAgain, the quadratic coefficient is positive and the constant term is negative, guaranteeing a unique positive real root for $G^{*}$:\n$G^{*} = \\frac{-(s_{A}k_{GA} + d_{A}d_{G} - s_{G}k_{AG}) + \\sqrt{(s_{A}k_{GA} + d_{A}d_{G} - s_{G}k_{AG})^{2} + 4(d_{G}k_{AG})(s_{G}d_{A})}}{2d_{G}k_{AG}}$\n\n**Local Stability Analysis**\nTo characterize the stability of this unique positive steady state, we analyze the Jacobian matrix of the system, evaluated at $(A^{*}, G^{*})$. Let $f(A,G) = s_{A} - d_{A}A - k_{AG}AG$ and $g(A,G) = s_{G} - d_{G}G - k_{GA}GA$. The Jacobian matrix $J$ is:\n$J = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial A}  \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial G} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial A}  \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial G} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -d_{A} - k_{AG}G  -k_{AG}A \\\\ -k_{GA}G  -d_{G} - k_{GA}A \\end{pmatrix}$\nEvaluating at the steady state $(A^{*}, G^{*})$:\n$J^{*} = \\begin{pmatrix} -d_{A} - k_{AG}G^{*}  -k_{AG}A^{*} \\\\ -k_{GA}G^{*}  -d_{G} - k_{GA}A^{*} \\end{pmatrix}$\nThe stability of the fixed point is determined by the eigenvalues of $J^{*}$. For a $2 \\times 2$ system, stability is ensured if the trace is negative and the determinant is positive.\nThe trace of $J^{*}$ is:\n$\\mathrm{Tr}(J^{*}) = (-d_{A} - k_{AG}G^{*}) + (-d_{G} - k_{GA}A^{*}) = -(d_{A} + d_{G} + k_{AG}G^{*} + k_{GA}A^{*})$\nSince all parameters and steady-state concentrations $(A^{*}, G^{*})$ are strictly positive, $\\mathrm{Tr}(J^{*})  0$.\n\nThe determinant of $J^{*}$ is:\n$\\mathrm{Det}(J^{*}) = (-d_{A} - k_{AG}G^{*})(-d_{G} - k_{GA}A^{*}) - (-k_{AG}A^{*})(-k_{GA}G^{*})$\n$\\mathrm{Det}(J^{*}) = (d_{A}d_{G} + d_{A}k_{GA}A^{*} + d_{G}k_{AG}G^{*} + k_{AG}k_{GA}A^{*}G^{*}) - k_{AG}k_{GA}A^{*}G^{*}$\n$\\mathrm{Det}(J^{*}) = d_{A}d_{G} + d_{A}k_{GA}A^{*} + d_{G}k_{AG}G^{*}$\nSince all parameters and concentrations are positive, $\\mathrm{Det}(J^{*})  0$.\n\nBecause $\\mathrm{Tr}(J^{*})  0$ and $\\mathrm{Det}(J^{*})  0$, the real parts of both eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix are strictly negative. This proves that the unique positive steady state is locally stable for all possible choices of positive parameters.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe analysis demonstrates that the model possesses exactly one positive steady state, and this steady state is always locally stable. Therefore, this minimal mass-action model **cannot** exhibit bistability or switch-like behavior. The system's dynamics are governed by mutual negative feedback: an increase in $A$ leads to a decrease in $G$, and an increase in $G$ leads to a decrease in $A$. This structure is self-regulating and always drives the system toward a single, unique, stable equilibrium point.
