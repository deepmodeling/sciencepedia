A pollen grain, the male gametophyte, delivers two haploid (n) sperm nuclei to the female gametophyte, also known as the embryo sac.

The second sperm nucleus fuses with the central cell to form the endosperm, a nutritive tissue that supports the embryo.\n\nIn the most common form of embryo sac development (the *Polygonum* type), the central cell is formed by the fusion of two haploid polar nuclei, making it a diploid (2n) cell.

Cytological calibration of this duo1 line shows the following, per pollen tube burst at the synergid: with probability $q = 0.10$ the tube releases exactly $2$ functional sperm, with probability $r = 0.80$ it releases exactly $1$ functional sperm, and with probability $u = 0.10$ it releases $0$ functional sperm (with $q + r + u = 1$).

The *DUO1* gene is a known regulator of male germline development in *Arabidopsis thaliana*, and its mutation leads to defects in sperm cell formation, consistent with the premise. Double fertilization is the canonical mode of reproduction in angiosperms. The experimental setup, while idealized, represents a valid line of inquiry in plant reproductive biology. The probabilistic treatment of gamete fusion is a standard modeling approach for such phenomena. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is mathematically well-posed. It provides a complete set of probabilities ($q, r, u, e$) that partition the event space. The outcomes are defined as mutually exclusive and exhaustive. A unique set of frequencies can be calculated. The condition $q+r+u=0.10+0.80+0.10=1$ confirms the completeness of the initial state probabilities.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise, quantitative, and free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formulated problem in probability theory applied to genetics and cell biology. Proceeding to solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe frequency of each outcome is its total probability, which can be calculated using the law of total probability. The overall sample space is partitioned by the number of sperm cells released by the pollen tube: $2$ sperm, $1$ sperm, or $0$ sperm. Let $S_n$ denote the event that $n$ sperm cells are released. The probabilities of these events are given as $P(S_2) = q = 0.10$, $P(S_1) = r = 0.80$, and $P(S_0) = u = 0.10$.\n\nWe must analyze the conditional probabilities of the four outcomes for each case.\n\n**Case 1: Two sperm cells are released ($S_2$)**\nThis occurs with probability $q = 0.10$. With two functional sperm cells, normal double fertilization occurs. One sperm fertilizes the egg cell, and the other fertilizes the central cell. The problem implies this is a deterministic outcome, as it is the wild-type behavior that the *duo1* mutation disrupts.\n- Probability of a \"Normal seed\" given $2$ sperm: $P(\\text{Normal seed} | S_2) = 1$.\n- Probabilities of other outcomes are zero: $P(\\text{Embryo-only} | S_2) = 0$, $P(\\text{Endosperm-only} | S_2) = 0$, $P(\\text{Unfertilized} | S_2) = 0$.\n\n**Case 2: One sperm cell is released ($S_1$)**\nThis occurs with probability $r = 0.80$. With only one sperm, double fertilization is impossible. The single sperm fertilizes either the egg cell or the central cell.\n- The sperm fertilizes the egg cell with probability $e = 0.70$, resulting in an \"Embryo-only\" outcome. Thus, $P(\\text{Embryo-only} | S_1) = e = 0.70$.\n- The sperm fertilizes the central cell with probability $1 - e = 0.30$, resulting in an \"Endosperm-only\" outcome. Thus, $P(\\text{Endosperm-only} | S_1) = 1 - e = 0.30$.\n- \"Normal seed\" is not possible: $P(\\text{Normal seed} | S_1) = 0$.\n- \"Unfertilized\" is not possible, as the probabilities of the two fusion events sum to $1$: $P(\\text{Unfertilized} | S_1) = 0$.\n\n**Case 3: Zero sperm cells are released ($S_0$)**\nThis occurs with probability $u = 0.10$. With no sperm cells, no fertilization can take place.\n- The ovule remains unfertilized with certainty. $P(\\text{Unfertilized} | S_0) = 1$.\n- All other outcomes have zero probability: $P(\\text{Normal seed} | S_0) = 0$, $P(\\text{Embryo-only} | S_0) = 0$, $P(\\text{Endosperm-only} | S_0) = 0$.\n\n**Calculation of Total Probabilities**\n\nWe now combine these conditional probabilities with the probabilities of each case to find the overall frequency of each outcome.\n\n1.  **Frequency of Normal seed:**\n    $$P(\\text{Normal seed}) = P(\\text{Normal seed}|S_2)P(S_2) + P(\\text{Normal seed}|S_1)P(S_1) + P(\\text{Normal seed}|S_0)P(S_0)$$\n    $$P(\\text{Normal seed}) = (1 \\times q) + (0 \\times r) + (0 \\times u) = 1 \\times 0.10 = 0.10$$\n    This corresponds to a frequency of $10\\%$.\n\n2.  **Frequency of Embryo-only fertilization:**\n    $$P(\\text{Embryo-only}) = P(\\text{Embryo-only}|S_2)P(S_2) + P(\\text{Embryo-only}|S_1)P(S_1) + P(\\text{Embryo-only}|S_0)P(S_0)$$\n    $$P(\\text{Embryo-only}) = (0 \\times q) + (e \\times r) + (0 \\times u) = 0.70 \\times 0.80 = 0.56$$\n    This corresponds to a frequency of $56\\%$.\n\n3.  **Frequency of Endosperm-only fertilization:**\n    $$P(\\text{Endosperm-only}) = P(\\text{Endosperm-only}|S_2)P(S_2) + P(\\text{Endosperm-only}|S_1)P(S_1) + P(\\text{Endosperm-only}|S_0)P(S_0)$$\n    $$P(\\text{Endosperm-only}) = (0 \\times q) + ((1-e) \\times r) + (0 \\times u) = 0.30 \\times 0.80 = 0.24$$\n    This corresponds to a frequency of $24\\%$.\n\n4.  **Frequency of Unfertilized ovule:**\n    $$P(\\text{Unfertilized}) = P(\\text{Unfertilized}|S_2)P(S_2) + P(\\text{Unfertilized}|S_1)P(S_1) + P(\\text{Unfertilized}|S_0)P(S_0) $$\n    $$P(\\text{Unfertilized}) = (0 \\times q) + (0 \\times r) + (1 \\times u) = 1 \\times 0.10 = 0.10$$\n    This corresponds to a frequency of $10\\%$.\n\nThe total probability is $0.10 + 0.56 + 0.24 + 0.10 = 1.00$, confirming the mutual exclusivity and exhaustiveness of the computed outcomes.\n\nThe predicted distribution is:\n- Normal seed: $10\\%$\n- Embryo-only: $56\\%$\n- Endosperm-only: $24\\%$\n- Unfertilized: $10\\%$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n- **A.

Correct.\n  - Embryo-only: $P(S_1) \\times e = r \\times e = 0.80 \\times 0.70 = 0.56$. Correct.\n  - Endosperm-only: $P(S_1) \\times (1-e) = r \\times (1-e) = 0.80 \\times 0.30 = 0.24$. Correct.\n  - Unfertilized: $P(S_0) = u = 0.10$. Correct.\n  Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n- **B. Normal seed $= 10\\%$, Embryo-only $= 24\\%$, Endosperm-only $= 56\\%$, Unfertilized $= 10\\%$.**\n  This option incorrectly swaps the frequencies for Embryo-only and Endosperm-only. This would be the result if one assumed the probability of egg fertilization was $1 - e = 0.30$ and central cell fertilization was $e = 0.70$, contradicting the premise that $e$ is the probability of egg cell fusion.\n  Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **C. Normal seed $= 20\\%$, Embryo-only $= 56\\%$, Endosperm-only $= 24\\%$, Unfertilized $= 0\\%$.**\n  This option provides incorrect frequencies for Normal seed and Unfertilized ovules. The \"Unfertilized\" frequency of $0\\%$ ignores the case where no sperm are released ($u=0.10$). The \"Normal seed\" frequency of $20\\%$ has no basis in the given probabilities.\n  Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D. Normal seed $= 10\\%$, Embryo-only $= 70\\%$, Endosperm-only $= 0\\%$, Unfertilized $= 20\\%$.**\n  This option contains multiple errors. The \"Embryo-only\" frequency of $70\\%$ is simply the value of $e$, failing to account for the fact that this outcome is conditional on the release of a single sperm, which occurs with probability $r = 0.80$. The \"Endosperm-only\" frequency is incorrectly $0\\%$. The \"Unfertilized\" frequency of $20\\%$ is also wrongly calculated.

The genomic dosage of the endosperm is therefore the sum of the two maternal polar nuclei and the paternal sperm nucleus that fertilizes the central cell. Consider a cross in which the maternal sporophyte is diploid ($2x$) and the paternal sporophyte is tetraploid ($4x$).

It presents a standard scenario in plant reproductive genetics involving an interploidy cross and its consequences for endosperm development. All necessary information is provided, and the questions are unambiguous. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of three quantities related to the endosperm resulting from a cross between a diploid ($2x$) maternal parent and a tetraploid ($4x$) paternal parent. The quantities are the total endosperm ploidy ($E$), the maternal-to-paternal genomic ratio ($r$), and the likelihood of seed viability ($L$).\n\nFirst, we must determine the maternal and paternal genomic contributions to the endosperm. The problem states that double fertilization involves the fusion of one sperm nucleus with the central cell, which contains two maternal polar nuclei.\n\nThe maternal contribution, denoted by $m$, comes from the two polar nuclei. The maternal sporophyte is diploid, with a ploidy of $2x$. Following regular meiosis, it produces a haploid female gametophyte (embryo sac) where all nuclei have a ploidy of $x$. The central cell contains two such polar nuclei. Therefore, the total maternal contribution to the endosperm is the sum of the ploidies of these two nuclei:\n$$\nm = x + x = 2x\n$$\n\nThe paternal contribution, denoted by $p$, comes from the sperm nucleus that fertilizes the central cell. The paternal sporophyte is tetraploid, with a ploidy of $4x$. Regular meiosis in a tetraploid organism produces diploid gametes. Thus, the pollen grains are diploid, and the sperm nuclei they contain have a ploidy of $2x$. The paternal contribution to the endosperm is therefore:\n$$\np = 2x\n$$\n\nWith the maternal and paternal contributions established, we can compute the required quantities.\n\n1.  **Total endosperm ploidy ($E$)**: The total ploidy of the endosperm is the sum of the maternal and paternal contributions.\n    $$\n    E = m + p = 2x + 2x = 4x\n    $$\n    The problem asks for $E$ to be expressed in total haploid genome equivalents ($x$). This is the numerical coefficient of $x$. Thus, the value for $E$ is $4$.\n\n2.  **Maternal-to-paternal genomic ratio ($r$)**: This ratio is defined as $r = m/p$. Substituting the derived contributions:\n    $$\n    r = \\frac{m}{p} = \\frac{2x}{2x} = 1\n    $$\n    The ratio $r$ is a dimensionless quantity with an exact value of $1$.\n\n3.  **Likelihood of seed viability ($L$)**: The viability is modeled by the function $L = \\exp(-\\alpha(r-2)^2)$.
