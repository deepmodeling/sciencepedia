Assume a large population where $k$ equally effective $S$-alleles segregate (no dominance, all alleles enforce incompatibility symmetrically). A focal maternal plant has diploid $S$-genotype $S_{a}/S_{b}$ with $a \\neq b$.

Your final answer must be a single analytic expression.", "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution. The model described is a standard representation of Gametophytic Self-Incompatibility (GSI) in population genetics.\n\nThe task is to find the expected proportion of compatible pollen grains arriving at a focal maternal plant with the genotype $S_{a}/S_{b}$, where $a \\neq b$. The pollen cloud is characterized by an allele frequency vector $\\mathbf{p} = (p_{1}, p_{2}, \\ldots, p_{k})$ for $k$ distinct $S$-alleles, where $p_{i}$ is the frequency of the $S_{i}$ allele and $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_{i} = 1$.\n\nLet us consider a single pollen grain arriving at the stigma of the focal plant. The identity of the $S$-allele carried by this pollen grain is a random variable. The sample space of possible alleles is $\\{S_{1}, S_{2}, \\ldots, S_{k}\\}$. Based on the problem statement, the probability that a randomly chosen pollen grain carries the allele $S_{i}$ is given by its frequency in the pollen cloud, $p_{i}$.\n\nThe GSI rule for compatibility is explicitly stated: a pollen grain carrying allele $S_{i}$ is compatible if and only if its allele does not match either of the two alleles present in the maternal diploid style. For the maternal plant with genotype $S_{a}/S_{b}$, this means a pollen grain with allele $S_{i}$ is compatible if and only if $i \\notin \\{a, b\\}$.\n\nLet $C$ be the event that a single, randomly selected pollen grain is compatible. We are asked to find the expected proportion of compatible pollen, which, by the law of large numbers for a large pollen cloud, is equivalent to the probability of this event, $P(C)$.\n\nWe can calculate $P(C)$ by considering the complementary event, $C'$, which is the event that a pollen grain is incompatible. A pollen grain is incompatible if its $S$-allele matches one of the maternal alleles. This means a pollen grain carrying allele $S_{i}$ is incompatible if $i \\in \\{a, b\\}$.\n\nThe event $C'$ corresponds to the pollen grain carrying either allele $S_{a}$ or allele $S_{b}$. Since a single pollen grain is haploid and can carry only one $S$-allele, the events of carrying $S_{a}$ and carrying $S_{b}$ are mutually exclusive. Therefore, the probability of the pollen being incompatible is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n$$P(C') = P(\\text{pollen is } S_{a}) + P(\\text{pollen is } S_{b})$$\nFrom the problem definition, the probabilities of encountering pollen with alleles $S_{a}$ and $S_{b}$ are their frequencies in the pollen cloud, which are $p_{a}$ and $p_{b}$, respectively.\n$$P(C') = p_{a} + p_{b}$$\nThe event of being compatible, $C$, is the complement of the event of being incompatible, $C'$. The probabilities of complementary events must sum to $1$.\n$$P(C) + P(C') = 1$$\nTherefore, the probability that a pollen grain is compatible is:\n$$P(C) = 1 - P(C')$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(C')$, we obtain:\n$$P(C) = 1 - (p_{a} + p_{b})$$\nThis expression can be written as:\n$$P(C) = 1 - p_{a} - p_{b}$$\nThis probability represents the expected proportion of pollen grains from the cloud that will be compatible with the $S_{a}/S_{b}$ maternal plant. This is the closed-form expression required.\n\nAlternatively, we can arrive at the same result by directly summing the probabilities of all compatible outcomes. The compatible alleles are all alleles $S_{i}$ such that $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\} \\setminus \\{a, b\\}$. The probability of compatibility is the sum of the frequencies of all such compatible alleles:\n$$P(C) = \\sum_{i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\} \\setminus \\{a, b\\}} p_{i}$$\nWe know that the sum of all allele frequencies is $1$:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_{i} = 1$$\nThis sum can be partitioned into the sum over compatible alleles and the sum over incompatible alleles:\n$$\\left( \\sum_{i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\} \\setminus \\{a, b\\}} p_{i} \\right) + \\left( \\sum_{i \\in \\{a, b\\}} p_{i} \\right) = 1$$\nSince $a \\neq b$, the sum over the incompatible alleles is simply $p_{a} + p_{b}$. So,\n$$P(C) + (p_{a} + p_{b}) = 1$$\nRearranging this equation gives the same result as before:\n$$P(C) = 1 - p_{a} - p_{b}$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the expected proportion of compatible pollen.

It presents a standard, albeit idealized, model of gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) that is amenable to rigorous mathematical analysis. The parameters and rules are specified without ambiguity, contradiction, or reliance on non-scientific premises. We will therefore proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part derivation concerning the compatibility of matings in a population with a GSI system controlled by a single $S$-locus with $k \\ge 3$ alleles.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the compatibility matrix entry $M_{\\{i,j\\} \\to \\{a,b\\}}$.\nLet the donor genotype be $D = \\{i,j\\}$, where $i, j \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, k\\}$ and $i \\ne j$.

Consequently, it is accepted if $p \\notin \\{a,b\\}$.\nThe fraction of pollen from donor $\\{i,j\\}$ accepted by recipient $\\{a,b\\}$ is the sum of the accepted proportions of each pollen type:\n$$M_{\\{i,j\\} \\to \\{a,b\\}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\mathbb{I}(i \\notin \\{a,b\\}) + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\mathbb{I}(j \\notin \\{a,b\\})$$\nwhere $\\mathbb{I}(\\cdot)$ is the indicator function, which equals $1$ if its argument is true and $0$ otherwise.\n\nWe analyze this expression based on the number of alleles shared between the donor and recipient, which is given by the size of the set intersection, $s = |\\{i,j\\} \\cap \\{a,b\\}|$.\n\nCase 1: $s = 2$.\nThis implies $\\{i,j\\} = \\{a,b\\}$. The donor and recipient have the same genotype.\nIn this case, both $i \\in \\{a,b\\}$ and $j \\in \\{a,b\\}$.\nThus, $\\mathbb{I}(i \\notin \\{a,b\\}) = 0$ and $\\mathbb{I}(j \\notin \\{a,b\\}) = 0$.\nThe acceptance fraction is $M = \\frac{1}{2}(0) + \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$. This is complete rejection.\n\nCase 2: $s = 1$.\nThis implies the donor and recipient share exactly one allele. Without loss of generality, let $i=a$ and $j \\ne b$ (and also $j \\ne i, a \\ne b$).\nHere, $i \\in \\{a,b\\}$ but $j \\notin \\{a,b\\}$.\nThus, $\\mathbb{I}(i \\notin \\{a,b\\}) = 0$ and $\\mathbb{I}(j \\notin \\{a,b\\}) = 1$.\nThe acceptance fraction is $M = \\frac{1}{2}(0) + \\frac{1}{2}(1) = \\frac{1}{2}$.

The total number of possible heterozygous recipient genotypes in the population is $N_{geno} = \\binom{k}{2} = \\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$. We categorize these recipients by the number of alleles they share with the donor $\\{1,2\\}$.\n\n1.  Complete Rejection ($M=0$, corresponding to $s=2$):\n    The recipient genotype $\\{a,b\\}$ must be identical to the donor genotype $\\{1,2\\}$. There is only $1$ such genotype.\n\n2.  Partial Acceptance ($M=\\frac{1}{2}$, corresponding to $s=1$):\n    The recipient genotype must share exactly one allele with $\\{1,2\\}$.\n    If it shares allele $S_1$, its genotype is of the form $\\{1, c\\}$ where $c \\notin \\{1,2\\}$. There are $k-2$ choices for $c$ from the set $\\{3, 4, \\dots, k\\}$.\n    If it shares allele $S_2$, its genotype is of the form $\\{2, c\\}$ where $c \\notin \\{1,2\\}$. There are also $k-2$ choices for $c$.\n    The total number of such genotypes is $(k-2) + (k-2) = 2(k-2)$.\n\n3.  Full Acceptance ($M=1$, corresponding to $s=0$):\n    The recipient genotype $\\{a,b\\}$ must share no alleles with $\\{1,2\\}$. Both $a$ and $b$ must be chosen from the set of $k-2$ alleles $\\{3, 4, \\dots, k\\}$.\n    The number of ways to choose $2$ distinct alleles from this set is $\\binom{k-2}{2} = \\frac{(k-2)(k-3)}{2}$.\n\nA simple check confirms the enumeration: $1 + 2(k-2) + \\frac{(k-2)(k-3)}{2} = \\frac{2 + 4k - 8 + k^2 - 5k + 6}{2} = \\frac{k^2 - k}{2} = \\binom{k}{2}$, which is the total number of heterozygous genotypes. The condition $k \\ge 3$ ensures these counts are non-negative.\n\nThird, we compute the expected acceptance rate $\\mathbb{E}[M]$.\nThe problem specifies that donor and recipient genotypes are drawn independently and uniformly at random. Due to symmetry, the expected acceptance rate is independent of the specific donor genotype chosen. We can therefore calculate the expectation for our fixed donor $\\{1,2\\}$ against a uniformly random recipient.\nThe total number of recipient genotypes is $N_{geno} = \\binom{k}{2}$. The probability of drawing any specific recipient is $\\frac{1}{N_{geno}}$.\nThe expected value $\\mathbb{E}[M]$ is the sum of each possible acceptance fraction multiplied by its probability of occurrence.

The expectation is calculated based on the number of pollen grains of each type (self and non-self) and their respective probabilities of success. The linearity of expectation allows us to sum the expected contributions from each pollen type.\n\nFirst, let us determine the number of self and non-self pollen grains.\nThe total number of pollen grains is $P = 80$.\nThe number of self pollen grains, $P_{s}$, is given by the fraction $f_{s}$ of the total:\n$$P_{s} = P \\times f_{s} = 80 \\times 0.6 = 48$$\nThe number of non-self (compatible) pollen grains, $P_{ns}$, is the remainder:\n$$P_{ns} = P \\times (1 - f_{s}) = 80 \\times (1 - 0.6) = 80 \\times 0.4 = 32$$\n\nNext, we will calculate the expected seed set for each SI regime.\n\n**1.
