The outer wall (exine) is made of sporopollenin, deposited on a primexine template. Monomers for sporopollenin are supplied by the tapetum.\n2.  **Key Enzymes:** Acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) synthetase 5 (ACOS5) and cytochrome P450 family enzyme CYP703A2 are nonredundant enzymes operating early in the tapetal sporopollenin monomer pathway.\n3.  **Mutation:** Loss-of-function mutants are generated, eliminating the catalytic activity ($k_{\\mathrm{cat}} \\to 0$) of either ACOS5 or CYP703A2. Other processes like primexine scaffolding and callose-wall dynamics are normal.\n4.  **Principle of Pathway Flux:** \"A catalytic step that is uniquely required upstream in a linear pathway constrains pathway flux by mass balance; if the step has zero activity, the net flux of its products is $0$.\"\n5.  **Principle of Exine Deposition:** \"The total exine polymer mass $M_{\\mathrm{exine}}(t)$ on a microspore satisfies $dM_{\\mathrm{exine}}/dt = J_{\\mathrm{mono}}(t)$, where $J_{\\mathrm{mono}}(t)$ is the net monomer delivery flux to the deposition site.\"\n6.  **Principle of Wall Mechanics:** \"The exine provides mechanical stiffness... a thinner load-bearing wall $h$ at given turgor $P$ increases membrane and wall stress (by thin-shell mechanics, $\\sigma \\propto Pr / (2h)$, where $r$ is the microspore radius).\"\n\n**Step 2: Problem Validation**\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded in established principles of plant reproductive biology, biochemistry, and biophysics. The roles of the tapetum, ACOS5, CYP703A2, and sporopollenin in exine formation are well-documented. The problem is well-posed, providing a clear cause (specific gene knockout) and asking for a predictable effect based on explicitly stated principles (mass balance, deposition kinetics, and mechanical stress). The language is objective and precise. The premises are internally consistent and sufficient to derive a unique solution. The model, though simplified (e.g., using a proportionality for stress), captures the essential physics and biology correctly.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe solution will be derived by a logical progression from the molecular defect to the whole-cell phenotype.\n\n1.  **Biochemical Consequence:** The problem states that ACOS5 and CYP703A2 are \"nonredundant\" enzymes that are \"early\" in the sporopollenin monomer pathway. A loss-of-function mutation eliminates their catalytic activity ($k_{\\mathrm{cat}} \\to 0$). According to the supplied principle of pathway flux, if a uniquely required upstream step has zero activity, the net flux of its products is $0$. Therefore, the synthesis of sporopollenin monomers in the tapetum is completely blocked. This implies that the delivery flux of these monomers to the developing microspore surface, $J_{\\mathrm{mono}}(t)$, must be approximately zero for all time $t$.\n    $$J_{\\mathrm{mono}}(t) \\approx 0$$\n\n2.  **Morphological Consequence:** The deposition of the exine is governed by the equation $dM_{\\mathrm{exine}}/dt = J_{\\mathrm{mono}}(t)$. Since $J_{\\mathrm{mono}}(t) \\approx 0$, the rate of change of exine mass is also approximately zero.\n    $$\\frac{dM_{\\mathrm{exine}}}{dt} \\approx 0$$\n    Integrating this from the beginning of exine deposition, we find that the total mass of the exine, $M_{\\mathrm{exine}}$, does not increase beyond its initial value, which is effectively zero (as the primexine template is a scaffold, not the bulk material). This means no functional exine is formed. The microspore surface would lack the thick, ornamented sporopollenin layer and would appear nearly smooth. The wall thickness, $h$, would be drastically reduced, comprising only the thin intine and the plasma membrane.\n\n3.  **Biomechanical Consequence:** The exine's primary function is to provide mechanical stiffness. The stress on the microspore wall is given by $\\sigma \\propto Pr / (2h)$. In the mutant, the thickness of the load-bearing wall, $h$, is very small compared to a wild-type microspore. As $h$ approaches the thickness of the intine alone, the wall stress $\\sigma$ becomes extremely large for any non-zero internal turgor pressure $P$, which is naturally generated by the living protoplast. The thin intine and plasma membrane are biomechanically insufficient to withstand this high stress. Consequently, the microspore is predicted to rupture and lyse. This cellular collapse would occur during development, well before the pollen grain matures and the anther dehisces (anthesis).\n\n4.  **Viability and Germination Consequence:** A microspore that has undergone catastrophic mechanical failure and cellular collapse is, by definition, dead. Therefore, the resulting pollen grains will be nonviable. This would be confirmed by vital stains, which distinguish between living and dead cells. A nonviable pollen grain is incapable of metabolic activity, including germination and pollen tube growth. Thus, there will be a complete failure to germinate, both *in vitro* and *in vivo* on a receptive stigma.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Severe loss of exine (nearly smooth microspores), collapse and degeneration of microspores before anthesis, pollen nonviable by vital stains with failure to germinate either in vitro or on stigmas; explained by $J_{\\mathrm{mono}} \\approx 0 \\Rightarrow M_{\\mathrm{exine}} \\approx 0$ and elevated wall stress with only intine present.**\n    This option perfectly aligns with the derived consequences. It correctly identifies the lack of exine ($J_{\\mathrm{mono}} \\approx 0 \\Rightarrow M_{\\mathrm{exine}} \\approx 0$), the resulting mechanical collapse (\"elevated wall stress\"), the developmental timing of the failure (\"before anthesis\"), and the ultimate phenotype of non-viability and failed germination. The explanation provided is precisely the one derived from the problem's principles.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Exine thickening due to compensatory upregulation of downstream polymerization steps, with hyperviable pollen that germinates faster and produces longer tubes in vitro; explained by accumulation of upstream substrates that drive alternative polymerization.**\n    This option is fundamentally flawed. Blocking an upstream step in a linear, nonredundant pathway starves the downstream steps of substrate; it cannot cause \"exine thickening\". The concept of \"compensatory upregulation\" is nonsensical without substrate. This violates the principle of mass balance.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Largely normal pollen development with only subtle alterations in exine ornamentation; pollen remains viable and germinates in vitro, but fails to germinate on stigmas due to loss of exine-dependent recognition cues.**\n    This option incorrectly assumes the defect is \"subtle\". The problem states the enzymes are \"nonredundant\" and \"early\" in the pathway, implying a catastrophic, not subtle, outcome. The prediction of viability and *in vitro* germination directly contradicts the biomechanical analysis showing inevitable cell collapse.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Formation of an exine-like shell from cutin-like polymers secreted by the tapetum, yielding brittle but intact exine; pollen partially viable with short, slow-growing tubes in vitro owing to altered monomer composition.**\n    This option invokes the formation of an alternative polymer (\"cutin-like\") which is not mentioned or supported by the problem statement. This is an unsubstantiated speculation. Furthermore, it predicts partial viability, which is inconsistent with the catastrophic loss of the primary structural wall component predicted by the thin-shell mechanics principle.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. Arrest at tetrad stage with persistent callose wall and failure of microspore release; pollen inviability arises from physical entrapment rather than wall composition defects, but any released pollen germinates normally in vitro.**\n    This option directly contradicts a premise of the problem, which states that \"callose-wall dynamics are otherwise normal.\" This premise implies that callose degradation and microspore release should occur on schedule. Therefore, arrest at the tetrad stage due to persistent callose is ruled out.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2602394"}, {"introduction": "Reproductive success in nature is rarely a simple affair; it is a game of numbers, compatibility, and speed.

We can write the balance equation as:\n$$ A \\cdot \\Delta x \\cdot \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = [A \\cdot J(x,t) - A \\cdot J(x+\\Delta x, t)] - k \\cdot C \\cdot A \\cdot \\Delta x $$\nDividing the entire equation by the volume element $A \\cdot \\Delta x$, we obtain:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{J(x+\\Delta x, t) - J(x,t)}{\\Delta x} - k C $$\nIn the limit as $\\Delta x \\to 0$, the first term on the right-hand side becomes the negative partial derivative of the flux with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} - k C $$\nSubstituting Fick's first law, $J = -D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}$, into this equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(-D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}\\right) - k C $$\nAssuming the diffusion coefficient $D$ is constant in space, we arrive at the governing reaction-diffusion equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} - k C $$\nThis is the required partial differential equation for $C(x,t)$.\n\nNext, we analyze the steady spatial profile. In steady state, the concentration does not change with time, which means $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = 0$. The PDE reduces to a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the spatial profile $C(x)$:\n$$ 0 = D \\frac{d^2 C}{dx^2} - k C $$\nThis can be rearranged as:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 C}{dx^2} = \\frac{k}{D} C $$\nThis is a standard linear homogeneous ODE. Its general solution is of the form:\n$$ C(x) = c_1 \\exp\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} x\\right) + c_2 \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} x\\right) $$\nwhere $c_1$ and $c_2$ are integration constants. The problem specifies that the concentration deviation must decay as $x \\to \\infty$. The term $\\exp\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} x\\right)$ grows without bound as $x \\to \\infty$. To satisfy the boundary condition $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} C(x) = 0$, the coefficient of this growing term, $c_1$, must be zero. Thus, the physically relevant solution is:\n$$ C(x) = c_2 \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} x\\right) $$\nThis solution describes an exponential decay. The characteristic spatial decay length scale, which we will denote as $L$, is the distance over which the concentration falls to $1/e$ of its initial value. This corresponds to the reciprocal of the coefficient of $x$ in the exponent. Therefore, the length scale $L$ is given by:\n$$ L = \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)^{-1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}} $$\nThis expression provides the characteristic length scale in terms of the given parameters $D$ and $k$.\n\nFinally, we are asked to evaluate this length scale numerically. The given values are:\n- Diffusion coefficient, $D = 200\\,\\mu\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}$\n- Effective rate constant, $k = 50\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $L$:\n$$ L = \\sqrt{\\frac{200\\,\\mu\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}}{50\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}} $$\nThe units are consistent: $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu\\text{m}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}}{\\text{s}^{-1}}} = \\sqrt{\\mu\\text{m}^2} = \\mu\\text{m}$.\nThe numerical calculation is:\n$$ L = \\sqrt{\\frac{200}{50}} \\, \\mu\\text{m} = \\sqrt{4} \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 2 \\, \\mu\\text{m} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Thus, the result is $2.000\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.000}$$", "id": "2602360"}]}
