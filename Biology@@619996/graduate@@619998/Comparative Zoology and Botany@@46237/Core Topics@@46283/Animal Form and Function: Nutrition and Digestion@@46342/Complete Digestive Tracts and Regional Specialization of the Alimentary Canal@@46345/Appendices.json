Protein digestion in Species $N$ is displaced distally to the proximal intestine and remains near that of Species $G$ due to upregulated, cold-adapted alkaline proteases and longer intestinal residence time; loss of the gastric acid barrier increases per-ingestion pathogen survival by roughly two orders of magnitude, but low ambient microbial loads in polar waters and additional antimicrobial actions of bile and mucosal immunity render infection risk context-dependent rather than uniformly high.\n\nC.

Without gastric acid, collagen-rich diets become largely indigestible in Species $N$, causing chronic nitrogen limitation; because acid chyme is normally neutralized before the intestine, the presence or absence of a gastric acid phase does not materially affect pathogen susceptibility in either species.", "solution": "The task requires an analysis of two main consequences for Species $N$ relative to Species $G$: (i) protein digestion efficiency and (ii) pathogen susceptibility.\n\n**(i) Protein Digestion Efficiency**\n\nIn Species $G$, protein digestion is a two-stage process:\n1.  **Stomach**: $\\text{pH} \\approx 2.0$ for $t_{res, stomach} \\approx 1\\,\\text{h}$. This acidic environment denatures proteins, increasing their susceptibility to proteolysis. Pepsin, with its acidic $\\text{pH}$ optimum, begins hydrolysis.\n2.  **Intestine**: $\\text{pH} \\approx 7.5$ for $t_{res, intestine} \\approx 5\\,\\text{h}$. Digestion is continued by alkaline proteases such as trypsin.\n\nIn Species $N$, the stomach is a simple conduit. All protein digestion is relegated to the intestine:\n1.  **Intestine**: $\\text{pH} \\approx 7.5$ for a longer residence time, $t_{res, intestine} \\approx 7\\,\\text{h}$.\n\nThe critical question is whether Species $N$ can compensate for the loss of the gastric acidic phase (both denaturation and pepsin action). The problem provides two key compensatory adaptations in Species $N$:\n1.  **Increased Enzyme Concentration**: Intestinal tissue in Species $N$ has an approximately $2$-fold higher $V_{\\max}$ for trypsin. Since $V_{\\max} = k_{\\text{cat}} [E]_{\\text{total}}$, and $k_{\\text{cat}}$ is stated to be similar for the trypsin in both species, this implies that the total enzyme concentration $[E]_{\\text{total}}$ is approximately doubled in Species $N$.\n2.  **Increased Residence Time**: The time available for intestinal digestion is longer in Species $N$ ($7\\,\\text{h}$) than in Species $G$ ($5\\,\\text{h}$), a factor of $7/5 = 1.4$.\n\nThe total digestive work performed in the intestine is a function of enzyme concentration, catalytic rate, and time. Let's compare the total potential for intestinal proteolysis. The capacity is proportional to $[E]_{\\text{total}} \\times t_{res, intestine}$.\n-   Relative intestinal capacity of Species $G$: $\\propto [E]_{G} \\times 5\\,\\text{h}$.\n-   Relative intestinal capacity of Species $N$: $\\propto [E]_{N} \\times 7\\,\\text{h} \\approx (2 \\times [E]_{G}) \\times 7\\,\\text{h} = 14 \\times [E]_{G} \\times \\text{h}$.\n\nThe ratio of intestinal proteolytic capacity (Species $N$ / Species $G$) is approximately $(14 \\times [E]_{G} \\times \\text{h}) / (5 \\times [E]_{G} \\times \\text{h}) = 2.8$.\nThis demonstrates that Species $N$ has a substantially higher proteolytic capacity in its intestine than Species $G$ does in its own intestine. This significant upregulation appears to be a direct evolutionary compensation for the loss of gastric digestion. While the lack of acid denaturation is a disadvantage, the combination of doubled enzyme concentration and $40\\%$ longer exposure time makes it highly plausible that the overall protein digestion efficiency in Species $N$ is maintained at a level comparable to that of Species $G$.\n\n**(ii) Pathogen Susceptibility**\n\nThe stomach's low $\\text{pH}$ acts as a \"gastric barrier\" against ingested microbes. We can quantify the effect of its loss.\n-   **Species $G$ (with acid barrier)**: The initial pathogen load is reduced by a factor of $10^{-3}$ in the stomach. A further reduction of $10^{-1}$ occurs in the intestine. The total survival fraction is $S_G = 10^{-3} \\times 10^{-1} = 10^{-4}$.\n-   **Species $N$ (no acid barrier)**: The neutral stomach only reduces the pathogen load by a factor of $10^{-1}$. The intestinal reduction is the same, $10^{-1}$. The total survival fraction is $S_N = 10^{-1} \\times 10^{-1} = 10^{-2}$.\n\nThe ratio of survival fractions is $S_N / S_G = 10^{-2} / 10^{-4} = 100$. This means that per ingestion event, Species $N$ experiences a $100$-fold (two orders of magnitude) higher number of viable pathogens entering its system compared to Species $G$. This represents a significant increase in theoretical susceptibility.\n\nHowever, the actual risk of infection is not determined by this factor alone. The problem states that these fish inhabit \"Antarctic notothenioid fishes inhabiting seawater at approximately $T \\approx 271.5\\,\\text{K}$\". Polar waters generally have very low microbial biomass compared to temperate or tropical waters. If the initial number of ingested pathogens is low, even a $100$-fold increase in survival may not be sufficient to surpass the infectious dose required to establish disease. Furthermore, the problem mentions additional defenses like bile and pancreatic secretions, and real biological systems possess other defenses like mucosal immunity. Therefore, while susceptibility is demonstrably increased, the resulting infection risk is likely \"context-dependent\" and not necessarily \"uniformly high\".\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. **Protein digestion efficiency in Species $N$ must decline sharply because the lack of low-$\\text{pH}$ denaturation cannot be compensated; selection therefore favored expansion of gastric pepsin isoforms despite neutral stomach conditions, and pathogen susceptibility increases dramatically irrespective of environmental context.**\n**Incorrect**. The quantitative analysis shows strong evidence for compensation in protein digestion. The claim about selection for pepsin is illogical, as pepsin is inactive at neutral $\\text{pH}$ and the problem states the gene is lost. The claim that increased susceptibility is irrespective of context ignores the crucial role of pathogen load in the environment.\n\nB. **Protein digestion in Species $N$ is displaced distally to the proximal intestine and remains near that of Species $G$ due to upregulated, cold-adapted alkaline proteases and longer intestinal residence time; loss of the gastric acid barrier increases per-ingestion pathogen survival by roughly two orders of magnitude, but low ambient microbial loads in polar waters and additional antimicrobial actions of bile and mucosal immunity render infection risk context-dependent rather than uniformly high.**\n**Correct**. This statement accurately synthesizes all points of the derivation. It correctly identifies the distal displacement of digestion, the compensatory mechanisms (upregulated proteases, longer residence time), the resultant maintenance of digestive efficiency, the correct quantification of increased pathogen survival ($100$-fold, i.e., two orders of magnitude), and the proper contextualization of infection risk based on environmental factors (low microbial load) and additional biological defenses.\n\nC. **Loss of gastric acid in Species $N$ increases protein digestion efficiency because native proteins are not acid-denatured and are thus better substrates for alkaline proteases; neutral stomach conditions severely inhibit cold-adapted bacteria, thereby lowering pathogen susceptibility.**\n**Incorrect**. This option contains two fundamental errors. First, acid denaturation generally *increases* the rate of enzymatic digestion, it does not decrease it. Native proteins are typically more resistant to proteolysis. Second, it claims neutral conditions inhibit bacteria, which is directly contradicted by the data provided ($10^{-1}$ survival at $\\text{pH} \\approx 7.0$ vs. $10^{-3}$ at $\\text{pH} \\approx 2.0$).\n\nD. **The energetic savings from eliminating acid secretion in Species $N$ are negligible, so the trait primarily reflects selection to avoid dissolving calcium carbonate from prey shells; the main consequence is a large increase in parasite load without significant effects on protein digestion.**\n**Incorrect**. This option introduces a new hypothesis (\"avoid dissolving calcium carbonate\") for which no evidence is provided in the problem statement, making it speculative. While the energetic savings ($125-250\\,\\text{J}$ per meal) might be small relative to a total daily budget, calling them \"negligible\" as a selective pressure in an energy-poor environment is debatable and not the most central conclusion. The primary reason for rejecting this option is its reliance on unsubstantiated speculation over the well-supported conclusions in Option B.\n\nE. **Without gastric acid, collagen-rich diets become largely indigestible in Species $N$, causing chronic nitrogen limitation; because acid chyme is normally neutralized before the intestine, the presence or absence of a gastric acid phase does not materially affect pathogen susceptibility in either species.**\n**Incorrect**. The diet is stated as \"chiefly crustaceans\", not necessarily \"collagen-rich\". The claim of \"largely indigestible\" is extreme and ignores the demonstrated compensatory mechanisms. The second part of the statement is factually wrong based on the problem data; pathogen susceptibility is materially affected, with a $100$-fold difference in pathogen survival between the two species.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2560233"}]}
