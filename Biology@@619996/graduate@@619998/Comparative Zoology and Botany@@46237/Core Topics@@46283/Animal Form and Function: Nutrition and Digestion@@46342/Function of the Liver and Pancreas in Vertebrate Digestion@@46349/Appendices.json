Consider the duodenal lumen at pH $6.5$ in a vertebrate whose liver secretes both unconjugated cholate (monoprotic acid form) with $pK_a=5.5$ and glycocholate (glycine-conjugated cholate) with $pK_a=4.3$.

A generic monoprotic weak acid, denoted $HA$, dissociates in aqueous solution according to the equilibrium:\n$$HA \\rightleftharpoons H^{+} + A^{-}$$\nHere, $HA$ is the protonated (acid) form and $A^{-}$ is the deprotonated (conjugate base or ionized) form.\n\nThe law of mass action applied to this equilibrium gives the definition of the acid dissociation constant, $K_a$:\n$$K_a = \\frac{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}{[HA]}$$\nwhere $[...]$ denotes molar concentration.\n\nThe objective is to find the fraction, which we will call $\\alpha$, of the total bile acid species that exists in the ionized form, $A^{-}$. The total concentration of the acid is the sum of the concentrations of the protonated and deprotonated forms, $[HA] + [A^{-}]$. The fraction $\\alpha$ is therefore defined as:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA] + [A^{-}]}$$\nTo express $\\alpha$ as a function of $[H^{+}]$ and $K_a$, we first rearrange the $K_a$ expression to solve for $[HA]$:\n$$[HA] = \\frac{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}{K_a}$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[HA]$ into the denominator of the equation for $\\alpha$:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{[A^{-}]}{\\frac{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}{K_a} + [A^{-}]}$$\nThe term $[A^{-}]$ is present in the numerator and in both terms of the denominator. We can divide the numerator and denominator by $[A^{-}]$ (assuming $[A^{-}] \\neq 0$, which is true for any finite amount of acid in solution) to simplify the expression:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{\\frac{[H^{+}]}{K_a} + 1}$$\nRearranging the terms in the denominator gives:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[H^{+}]}{K_a}}$$\nThis equation relates the ionized fraction $\\alpha$ to the hydrogen ion concentration $[H^{+}]$ and the acid dissociation constant $K_a$.\n\nThe problem provides the definitions $pH = -\\log_{10}([H^{+}])$ and $pK_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)$. We can invert these definitions to express $[H^{+}]$ and $K_a$ in exponential form:\n$$[H^{+}] = 10^{-pH}$$\n$$K_a = 10^{-pK_a}$$\nSubstituting these into our derived expression for $\\alpha$:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{10^{-pH}}{10^{-pK_a}}}$$\nUsing the property of exponents $\\frac{10^a}{10^b} = 10^{a-b}$, we simplify the fraction in the denominator:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-pH - (-pK_a)}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pK_a - pH}}$$\nThis is the final required expression for the ionized fraction $\\alpha$ as a function of $pH$ and $pK_a$. This relationship is a form of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nWe will now apply this formula to the two bile acids at the specified duodenal $pH$ of $6.5$.\n\nFor unconjugated cholate, the given $pK_a$ is $5.5$. The $pH$ is $6.5$.\n$$\\alpha_{\\text{cholate}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{5.5 - 6.5}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-1.0}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.1} = \\frac{1}{1.1}$$\nCalculating this value and rounding to $4$ significant figures:\n$$\\alpha_{\\text{cholate}} \\approx 0.909090... \\approx 0.9091$$\n\nFor glycocholate (glycine-conjugated cholate), the given $pK_a$ is $4.3$. The $pH$ is again $6.5$.\n$$\\alpha_{\\text{glycocholate}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{4.3 - 6.5}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-2.2}}$$\nTo evaluate $10^{-2.2}$, we calculate its value: $10^{-2.2} \\approx 0.00630957$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$$\\alpha_{\\text{glycocholate}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.00630957...} = \\frac{1}{1.00630957...} \\approx 0.993730...$$\nRounding this value to $4$ significant figures:\n$$\\alpha_{\\text{glycocholate}} \\approx 0.9937$$\n\nThe results are to be provided as an ordered pair (unconjugated cholate, glycocholate). The pair of fractions is $(0.9091, 0.9937)$.\n\nFinally, we interpret these results. The problem states that mixed micelle formation, essential for solubilizing dietary lipids, depends on anionic amphipathic bile salts. The anionic form is the deprotonated form, $A^{-}$. Our calculations show that at the duodenal $pH$ of $6.5$, approximately $91\\%$ of unconjugated cholate is in the required anionic form, while over $99\\%$ of glycocholate is anionic. The conjugation of cholate with glycine lowers its $pK_a$ from $5.5$ to $4.3$, making it a stronger acid. This lower $pK_a$ ensures that the bile acid remains almost completely ionized across the physiological pH range of the duodenum. A higher fraction of ionized bile salt leads to more efficient formation of mixed micelles, thereby enhancing the digestion and absorption of fats. Unconjugated cholate, with a higher $pK_a$, is more susceptible to protonation if the duodenal pH falls, which would decrease its effectiveness as a solubilizing agent. Thus, conjugation is a critical biochemical modification that optimizes the function of bile acids for lipid digestion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.9091 & 0.9937 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2575118"}, {"introduction": "Maintaining a stable, near-neutral pH in the duodenum is a critical function jointly managed by the liver and pancreas, yet the scale of this homeostatic task is often underappreciated.
