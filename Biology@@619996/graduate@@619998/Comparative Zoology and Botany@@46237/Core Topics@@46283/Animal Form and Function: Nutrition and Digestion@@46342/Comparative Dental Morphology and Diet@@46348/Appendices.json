By convention, the dental formula is written as $I:C:P:M / I:C:P:M$, where the numerator describes the upper jaw and the denominator describes the lower jaw; each entry denotes the number of teeth per side (left or right). It is standard to assume bilateral symmetry within individuals (left and right sides of a given jaw have the same counts for a given tooth class) and that the formula pertains to adult dentition. In comparative studies, inter-individual variation in tooth counts within a population can be modeled probabilistically, and expected totals can be derived from the dental formula framework together with the principle of linearity of expectation.\n\nConsider a hypothetical mammalian lineage adapted to a mixed feeder diet on grasses and leaves, in which the unilateral (per side) counts for each tooth class in the upper and lower jaws vary across individuals as follows. Assume that, within an individual, left and right sides match for the count of a given tooth class, and that variation across tooth classes is probabilistically independent across the population.\n\n- Upper jaw per side:\n  - Incisors $I^{U}$: $3$ with probability $0.85$, $2$ with probability $0.15$.\n  - Canines $C^{U}$: $1$ with probability $1.00$.\n  - Premolars $P^{U}$: $4$ with probability $0.60$, $3$ with probability $0.40$.\n  - Molars $M^{U}$: $3$ with probability $0.90$, $2$ with probability $0.10$.\n- Lower jaw per side:\n  - Incisors $I^{L}$: $3$ with probability $0.95$, $2$ with probability $0.05$.\n  - Canines $C^{L}$: $1$ with probability $1.00$.\n  - Premolars $P^{L}$: $3$ with probability $1.00$.\n  - Molars $M^{L}$: $3$ with probability $0.80$, $2$ with probability $0.20$.\n\nTasks:\n1) Reconstruct the modal dental formula (the most probable per-side counts for each class), in the standard notation $I:C:P:M / I:C:P:M$.\n2) Using only core definitions (per-side dental formula notation, bilateral symmetry, and additivity of counts across sides and jaws) and well-tested probabilistic rules (linearity of expectation), derive and compute the expected total number of teeth per individual in this lineage.\n\nReport only the expected total number of teeth per individual as your final numeric answer.

It is scientifically grounded, using standard concepts from biology (dental formula) and mathematics (probability theory). It is well-posed, providing all necessary information, including complete probability distributions for each variable and the assumption of independence, which allows for a unique solution. The data are consistent and the language is objective and precise. The problem violates no principles of scientific or mathematical logic.\n\nWe proceed with the solution.\n\nThe first task is to reconstruct the modal dental formula. The mode of a discrete probability distribution is the value with the highest probability. Due to the stated independence of tooth classes, we can find the mode for each class individually.\n\nFor the upper jaw (unilateral):\n- Incisors $I^{U}$: The count of $3$ has a probability of $0.85$, which is greater than the probability of $0.15$ for the count of $2$. The mode is $3$.\n- Canines $C^{U}$: The count of $1$ has a probability of $1.00$. The mode is $1$.\n- Premolars $P^{U}$: The count of $4$ has a probability of $0.60$, which is greater than the probability of $0.40$ for the count of $3$. The mode is $4$.\n- Molars $M^{U}$: The count of $3$ has a probability of $0.90$, which is greater than the probability of $0.10$ for the count of $2$. The mode is $3$.\n\nFor the lower jaw (unilateral):\n- Incisors $I^{L}$: The count of $3$ has a probability of $0.95$, which is greater than the probability of $0.05$ for the count of $2$. The mode is $3$.\n- Canines $C^{L}$: The count of $1$ has a probability of $1.00$. The mode is $1$.\n- Premolars $P^{L}$: The count of $3$ has a probability of $1.00$. The mode is $3$.\n- Molars $M^{L}$: The count of $3$ has a probability of $0.80$, which is greater than the probability of $0.20$ for the count of $2$. The mode is $3$.\n\nAssembling these modal values into the standard formula gives the modal dental formula for the lineage: $3:1:4:3 / 3:1:3:3$.\n\nThe second task is to compute the expected total number of teeth in an individual. Let $N$ be the total number of teeth. It is the sum of teeth from both sides of the upper and lower jaws.

According to the problem's functional assumption, this requires the generation of high local stresses.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Provided Data**:\n    The area-normalized Dirichlet Normal Energy values for the two species are given as:\n    - Species $X$: $D_{X} = 1.6 \\times 10^{3} = 1600$ arbitrary units.\n    - Species $Y$: $D_{Y} = 7.0 \\times 10^{2} = 700$ arbitrary units.\n    A direct comparison shows that $D_{X} > D_{Y}$.\n\n2.  **Interpret DNE**:\n    The problem defines the meaning of a larger $E_D$ value: \"Larger values of $E_{D}$ indicate more rapid changes in $\\mathbf{n}$ across $S$ (i.e., greater concentration and extent of high-curvature features such as sharp crests and intercuspal edges).\"\n    Since $D_{X} > D_{Y}$, it follows directly that the occlusal surface of species $X$ has a greater concentration and extent of high-curvature features (i.e., is \"sharper\" and more complex) than the occlusal surface of species $Y$.\n\n3.  **Relate Morphology to Function**:\n    The problem provides a mechanistic link between morphology and function:\n    - Principle 1: High curvature ($k$) corresponds to sharp edges.\n    - Principle 3: Sharper crests (larger $k$) reduce the initial contact area, $A_{\\mathrm{contact}}$.\n    - Principle 2: Local stress $\\sigma$ is inversely proportional to contact area for a given bite force $F$, i.e., $\\sigma \\approx F/A_{\\mathrm{contact}}$.\n    - Functional Requirement: High local stress $\\sigma$ is needed to cut tough, fibrous foods.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Logical Chain**:\n    - Species $X$ has a higher DNE value ($D_{X}$).\n    - A higher DNE value implies a surface with more extensive and sharper crests (higher local curvature, $k$).\n    - Sharper crests lead to a smaller initial contact area ($A_{\\mathrm{contact}}$) with the food.\n    - For a given bite force $F$, a smaller $A_{\\mathrm{contact}}$ results in a higher local stress ($\\sigma$).\n    - High local stress is functionally advantageous for shearing tough, fibrous tissues.\n    - Therefore, the morphology of species $X$ is more adapted to the specified diet.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Species X, because the larger $D_{X}$ implies more extensive and sharper high-curvature crests, which reduce initial $A_{\\mathrm{contact}}$ and increase local $\\sigma$ at a given $F$, promoting cutting of tough plant tissues.**\nThis option correctly follows the entire logical chain derived above. It correctly identifies species $X$, correctly interprets the larger $D_{X}$ as indicating sharper crests, and correctly links this morphology to the mechanical principle of stress concentration ($A_{\\mathrm{contact}}$ reduction leading to increased $\\sigma$) and the functional outcome of improved cutting.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Species Y, because the smaller $D_{Y}$ implies smoother surfaces that distribute forces over larger $A_{\\mathrm{contact}}$, reducing stress concentrations that could otherwise cause chipping, thereby improving shearing performance.**\nThis option incorrectly selects species $Y$. While a lower DNE ($D_Y$) does imply smoother surfaces and a larger $A_{\\mathrm{contact}}$, this leads to *lower* local stress. The problem explicitly states that *high* local stress is required for cutting. Reducing stress is counter-productive for shearing tough foods. The argument about preventing chipping pertains to material durability, not cutting efficiency, which is the focus of the question.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Neither; DNE is dominated by surface area and wear, so with matched $A$ and wear stage it contains no information about shearing adaptation.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect within the context of the problem statement. The problem explicitly states that the DNE values are \"area-normalized\" and that the \"wear stage\" is \"matched\". These controls are specifically implemented to isolate the intrinsic geometric complexity of the tooth surface, which DNE measures. To claim it contains no information directly contradicts the definition provided in the problem statement itself.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Species Y, because lower DNE indicates taller cusps that puncture and therefore shear fibrous tissues more effectively than sharp crests do.**\nThis option contains unsupported assertions. First, there is no principle provided that links lower DNE to taller cusps. DNE is a measure of curvature and complexity, not absolute height; a tall but blunt cusp can have a lower DNE than a short but sharp crest. Second, it introduces a new mechanism (\"puncturing\") and claims it is more effective, which is an external hypothesis not supported by the problem's defined base principles, which focus on stress generation at *crests*.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2556023"}]}
