By calculating the minimum enzyme concentration required to digest a prey bolus within a specific timeframe, you will develop a quantitative understanding of how enzymatic efficiency dictates the pace of digestion in these simple metazoans.", "problem": "In cnidarians such as sea anemones, extracellular digestion in the gastrovascular (GV) cavity precedes intracellular digestion by gastrodermal cells. A similar two-phase strategy occurs in free-living flatworms (Platyhelminthes), where extracellular proteolysis in the branched GV cavity reduces prey tissue to a small-particle slurry that can then be phagocytosed for intracellular digestion. Consider a prey bolus of volume $1\\ \\mathrm{mm^{3}}$ captured and retained in the GV cavity of a cnidarian polyp. Empirical observations in such cavities under well-mixed conditions indicate that the loss of insoluble prey mass can be modeled as a pseudo-first-order process with respect to the remaining insoluble material, capturing the combined effects of surface erosion, fragmentation, and diffusion-accessible sites. Specifically, the mass $M(t)$ of undigested insoluble prey obeys the law of mass action for a first-order process, and the effective rate constant scales linearly with the bulk enzyme concentration due to low enzyme occupancy of substrate sites.\n\nAssume the following foundational facts:\n- The extracellular liquefaction step follows the first-order decay law for the insoluble prey mass, with $M(t) = M_{0}\\exp\\!\\left(-k_{\\mathrm{eff}} t\\right)$, where $M_{0}$ is the initial insoluble mass and $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is an effective first-order rate constant.\n- Under enzyme-limited conditions that are typical for early-phase extracellular digestion in the GV cavity, $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is proportional to the secreted enzyme concentration $[E]$ via $k_{\\mathrm{eff}} = k [E]$, where $k$ is an empirically measured proportionality constant that subsumes catalytic efficiency and geometry-dependent access.

Assume that prey density is effectively constant during digestion so that the fraction of undigested mass equals the fraction of undigested volume, and that mixing maintains a uniform enzyme concentration in the GV cavity.

Therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe physical process is governed by a mass balance over a differential control volume of the tissue. For a one-dimensional system at steady state, the balance between the net rate of diffusion and the rate of consumption is expressed as:\n$$-\\frac{dJ}{dx} - q = 0$$\nwhere $J$ is the molar flux of oxygen and $q$ is the volumetric consumption rate. According to Fick's first law of diffusion, the flux is proportional to the concentration gradient:\n$$J = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $C$ is the molar concentration.
