Let the organism have body mass $M$, characteristic body length $L$, and mass density $\\rho$ that is approximately equal to that of seawater and independent of size. The water is Newtonian, and the flows induced by the ciliary band occur at low Reynolds number, so that time-averaged volumetric flux across a porous surface of area $A$ driven by a mean tangential slip velocity $u_{s}$ scales as $Q \\propto A u_{s}$. The ciliary band forms a carpet of beating cilia with stroke amplitude $a$ and beat frequency $f$.

The derivation must be based on a set of provided biophysical and geometric principles for a clade of aquatic suspension feeders.\n\nThe problem states that the time-averaged volumetric flux, which we identify with the maximum filtration rate $Q_{\\max}$, across a porous surface of area $A$ driven by a mean tangential slip velocity $u_s$ scales as:\n$$\nQ_{\\max} \\propto A \\, u_s\n$$\nOur first step is to determine how the area $A$ and the slip velocity $u_s$ scale with the characteristic body length $L$.\n\nThe problem states that due to geometric similarity of body form and ciliary coverage, the total ciliated area $A_{\\mathrm{cil}}$ is a constant fraction of the body surface area. In geometrically similar organisms, all surface areas scale with the square of the characteristic length. Therefore, we have:\n$$\nA \\propto L^2\n$$\nThis is because the porous surface area $A$ is part of the organism's body and must scale isometrically with other surface areas under the assumption of geometric similarity.\n\nNext, we analyze the scaling of the mean slip velocity $u_s$. The problem provides the kinematic scaling relationship:\n$$\nu_s \\propto c_w \\, f \\, a\n$$\nwhere $c_w$ is a dimensionless waveform coefficient, $f$ is the beat frequency, and $a$ is the stroke amplitude. We are given the following scaling relations for these parameters with respect to body length $L$:\n1.  Kinematic similarity implies $c_w$ is independent of body size: $c_w \\propto L^0$.\n2.  Cilium stroke amplitude $a$ is set by ultrastructure and is independent of body size: $a \\propto L^0$.\n3.  Beat frequency $f$ is limited by molecular motor kinetics and is independent of body size: $f \\propto L^0$.\n\nSubstituting these dependencies into the expression for $u_s$:\n$$\nu_s \\propto (L^0) \\cdot (L^0) \\cdot (L^0) = L^0\n$$\nThis result indicates that the mean slip velocity $u_s$ generated by the cilia is independent of the overall body size $L$ of the organism. This is a crucial intermediate finding, stemming from the assumption that the fundamental properties of the cilia themselves do not change with the size of the animal.\n\nNow, we can combine the scaling relations for $A$ and $u_s$ to determine the scaling of $Q_{\\max}$ with body length $L$:\n$$\nQ_{\\max} \\propto A \\, u_s \\propto (L^2) \\cdot (L^0) = L^2\n$$\nThus, the maximum filtration rate scales with the square of the characteristic body length.\n\nThe final step is to express this scaling relationship in terms of body mass $M$. The problem states that for geometrically similar bodies with constant mass density $\\rho$, the mass $M$ is proportional to the volume, which scales with the cube of the characteristic length:\n$$\nM \\propto L^3\n$$\nTo express $L$ in terms of $M$, we rearrange this proportionality:\n$$\nL \\propto M^{1/3}\n$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $L$ into the scaling law for $Q_{\\max}$:\n$$\nQ_{\\max} \\propto L^2 \\propto \\left(M^{1/3}\\right)^2 = M^{2/3}\n$$\nBy comparing this result with the proposed scaling form $Q_{\\max} \\propto M^{\\alpha}$, we can identify the value of the exponent $\\alpha$.\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nThis value is exact and derived directly from the fundamental principles of geometric and kinematic similarity provided in the problem statement.
