It utilizes established physical laws, namely the van't Hoff relation for osmotic pressure and the hydraulic volume flux law. The parameters provided are within a realistic range for biological cells. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary constants, initial conditions, and clearly stated assumptions to formulate and solve a governing differential equation. The language is objective and precise. The problem is internally consistent and complete for the model requested. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Governing Equation and Solution\nThe volume of the cell changes due to water flux across its membrane, driven by the osmotic pressure difference. The rate of change of the cell volume, $V(t)$, is equal to the negative of the total outward water flux. The total outward flux is the product of the outward volume flux per unit area, $J_{v, \\text{out}}$, and the cell surface area, $A$.\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dt} = -A J_{v, \\text{out}} $$\nThe problem states to assume the area $A$ is constant and equal to its initial value, $A_0 = 4\\pi r^2$.\n\nThe outward volume flux, $J_{v, \\text{out}}$, is governed by the hydraulic flux law. Water moves from a region of higher water potential (lower osmotic pressure) to a region of lower water potential (higher osmotic pressure). The flux is directed from inside the cell to the outside, hence it is proportional to the difference $\\Pi_e - \\Pi_i$.\n$$ J_{v, \\text{out}} = L_p (\\Pi_e - \\Pi_i) $$\nHere, $\\Pi_e$ and $\\Pi_i$ are the osmotic pressures of the external and internal media, respectively. The van't Hoff relation gives the osmotic pressure as $\\Pi = \\sigma R T C$. Given the reflection coefficient $\\sigma = 1$, we have $\\Pi = R T C$.\n$$ J_{v, \\text{out}} = L_p R T (C_e - C_i(t)) $$\nCombining these equations gives the differential equation for the cell volume:\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dt} = -A_0 L_p R T (C_e - C_i(t)) $$\nThe problem states that the total amount of impermeant solutes inside the cell, $n_i$, is conserved. At time $t=0$, $n_i = C_{i0} V_0$, where $V_0 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$ is the initial cell volume. At any time $t$, the intracellular concentration is $C_i(t) = \\frac{n_i}{V(t)} = \\frac{C_{i0} V_0}{V(t)}$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $C_i(t)$ into the differential equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dt} = -A_0 L_p R T \\left( C_e - \\frac{C_{i0} V_0}{V} \\right) $$\nThis is the governing equation for the time evolution of the cell volume $V(t)$.\n\nTo solve this equation, we introduce a dimensionless volume variable $\\nu(t) = V(t)/V_0$. Then $V(t) = \\nu(t)V_0$ and $\\frac{dV}{dt} = V_0 \\frac{d\\nu}{dt}$. The equation becomes:\n$$ V_0 \\frac{d\\nu}{dt} = -A_0 L_p R T \\left( C_e - \\frac{C_{i0}}{\\nu} \\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{d\\nu}{dt} = -\\frac{A_0 L_p R T C_e}{V_0} \\left( 1 - \\frac{C_{i0}/C_e}{\\nu} \\right) $$\nLet us define two dimensionless constants: a rate constant $k = \\frac{A_0 L_p R T C_e}{V_0}$ and the equilibrium volume ratio $\\alpha = \\frac{C_{i0}}{C_e}$.

We separate the variables:\n$$ \\frac{\\nu}{\\nu - \\alpha} d\\nu = -k \\, dt $$\nWe integrate both sides. The left side is integrated from the initial state $\\nu(0)=1$ to the state at time $t$, $\\nu(t)$. The right side is integrated from $0$ to $t$.\n$$ \\int_1^{\\nu(t)} \\frac{\\nu}{\\nu - \\alpha} d\\nu = \\int_0^t -k \\, dt' $$\nThe integral on the left is evaluated as:\n$$ \\int \\frac{\\nu}{\\nu - \\alpha} d\\nu = \\int \\frac{(\\nu - \\alpha) + \\alpha}{\\nu - \\alpha} d\\nu = \\int \\left(1 + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\nu - \\alpha}\\right) d\\nu = \\nu + \\alpha \\ln|\\nu - \\alpha| $$\nApplying the limits of integration:\n$$ [\\nu + \\alpha \\ln(\\nu - \\alpha)]_1^{\\nu(t)} = -kt $$\nNote that water flows out, so $V(t)$ decreases from $V_0$. The process stops when $C_i(t)$ equals $C_e$, which implies the final volume $V_f = V_0 (C_{i0}/C_e) = \\alpha V_0$. Thus, $\\nu$ ranges from $1$ down to $\\alpha$, and $\\nu-\\alpha$ is always positive. The absolute value is not required.\n$$ \\left( \\nu(t) + \\alpha \\ln(\\nu(t)-\\alpha) \\right) - \\left( 1 + \\alpha \\ln(1-\\alpha) \\right) = -kt $$\n$$ \\nu(t) - 1 + \\alpha \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\nu(t)-\\alpha}{1-\\alpha}\\right) = -kt $$\nThis is the implicit solution for the dimensionless volume $\\nu(t)$.\n\nNow, we must evaluate the constants.

This is satisfied.\n\nThe final condition for stability is $a_2 a_1 > a_3 a_0$. Substituting the coefficients:\n$$\n(\\alpha + \\gamma + \\mu)(\\alpha\\gamma + \\alpha\\mu + \\gamma\\mu) > (1)(\\alpha\\gamma\\mu + k\\lambda\\beta)\n$$\nWe need to solve this inequality for the receptor gain $k$.\n$$\nk\\lambda\\beta < (\\alpha + \\gamma + \\mu)(\\alpha\\gamma + \\alpha\\mu + \\gamma\\mu) - \\alpha\\gamma\\mu\n$$\nLet us simplify the right-hand side of the inequality.\n$$\n(\\alpha + \\gamma + \\mu)(\\alpha\\gamma + \\alpha\\mu + \\gamma\\mu) - \\alpha\\gamma\\mu\n$$\nExpanding the product:\n$$\n= \\alpha(\\alpha\\gamma + \\alpha\\mu + \\gamma\\mu) + \\gamma(\\alpha\\gamma + \\alpha\\mu + \\gamma\\mu) + \\mu(\\alpha\\gamma + \\alpha\\mu + \\gamma\\mu) - \\alpha\\gamma\\mu\n$$\n$$\n= (\\alpha^2\\gamma + \\alpha^2\\mu + \\alpha\\gamma\\mu) + (\\alpha\\gamma^2 + \\alpha\\gamma\\mu + \\gamma^2\\mu) + (\\alpha\\gamma\\mu + \\alpha\\mu^2 + \\gamma\\mu^2) - \\alpha\\gamma\\mu\n$$\n$$\n= \\alpha^2\\gamma + \\alpha^2\\mu + \\alpha\\gamma^2 + \\gamma^2\\mu + \\alpha\\mu^2 + \\gamma\\mu^2 + 2\\alpha\\gamma\\mu\n$$\nThis expression can be elegantly factored. Consider the product $(\\alpha+\\gamma)(\\alpha+\\mu)(\\gamma+\\mu)$:\n$$\n(\\alpha+\\gamma)(\\alpha+\\mu)(\\gamma+\\mu) = (\\alpha^2 + \\alpha\\mu + \\alpha\\gamma + \\gamma\\mu)(\\gamma+\\mu)\n$$\n$$\n= \\alpha^2\\gamma + \\alpha\\mu\\gamma + \\alpha\\gamma^2 + \\gamma^2\\mu + \\alpha^2\\mu + \\alpha\\mu^2 + \\alpha\\gamma\\mu + \\gamma\\mu^2\n$$\n$$\n= \\alpha^2\\gamma + \\alpha^2\\mu + \\alpha\\gamma^2 + \\gamma^2\\mu + \\alpha\\mu^2 + \\gamma\\mu^2 + 2\\alpha\\gamma\\mu\n$$\nThis confirms the identity. Thus, the stability condition is:\n$$\nk\\lambda\\beta < (\\alpha+\\gamma)(\\alpha+\\mu)(\\gamma+\\mu)\n$$\nSince $\\lambda > 0$ and $\\beta > 0$, we can divide by $\\lambda\\beta$ without changing the inequality direction:\n$$\nk < \\frac{(\\alpha+\\gamma)(\\alpha+\\mu)(\\gamma+\\mu)}{\\lambda\\beta}\n$$\nThe system is stable for any $k$ in the interval $0 < k < k_{\\max}$. The maximum admissible receptor gain, $k_{\\max}$, is the value at which the system is on the boundary of stability (a Hopf bifurcation occurs), which corresponds to the inequality becoming an equality.\nTherefore, the expression for $k_{\\max}$ is:\n$$\nk_{\\max} = \\frac{(\\alpha+\\gamma)(\\alpha+\\mu)(\\gamma+\\mu)}{\\lambda\\beta}\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression as required.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\frac{(\\alpha+\\gamma)(\\alpha+\\mu)(\\gamma+\\mu)}{\\lambda\\beta} } $$", "id": "2593313"}]}
