Let the hydrostatic pressure on the source (coelomic) side be $P_c$ and in the tubular lumen be $P_i$. Let the oncotic (colloid osmotic) pressures due to impermeant or partially impermeant solutes on the coelomic and luminal sides be $\\pi_c$ and $\\pi_i$, respectively.

It is a direct application of the Starling principle for fluid transport across a semipermeable membrane, a fundamental concept in physiology. The problem is valid.\n\nWe begin by formalizing the principle provided: \"the net driving force for solvent movement across a semipermeable membrane is the difference in hydrostatic pressure minus the effective opposing colloid osmotic pressure (scaled by the reflection coefficient)\". The net driving force is the Net Filtration Pressure, denoted as $NFP$. The sign convention dictates that a positive $NFP$ corresponds to filtration from the coelomic cavity into the tubule lumen.\n\nFirst, we define the forces promoting filtration. The primary force driving fluid from the coelom into the tubule is the hydrostatic pressure gradient across the barrier. This is the difference between the coelomic hydrostatic pressure, $P_c$, and the luminal hydrostatic pressure, $P_i$. This pressure difference is given by:\n$$ \\Delta P = P_c - P_i $$\nA positive value for $\\Delta P$ promotes filtration.\n\nNext, we define the forces opposing filtration. These are related to the colloid osmotic (oncotic) pressure gradient. The oncotic pressure in the coelomic fluid, $\\pi_c$, tends to draw water out of the lumen and back into the coelom, thus opposing filtration. The oncotic pressure in the luminal fluid, $\\pi_i$, tends to draw water into the lumen, thus promoting filtration. The net oncotic pressure gradient that opposes filtration is therefore proportional to $(\\pi_c - \\pi_i)$.\n\nHowever, the filtration barrier is not perfectly impermeable to the solutes responsible for the oncotic pressure. Its selectivity is quantified by the reflection coefficient, $\\sigma$. A value of $\\sigma = 1$ would mean the membrane completely reflects the solutes, making the full oncotic pressure gradient effective. A value of $\\sigma = 0$ would mean the membrane is fully permeable to the solutes, and the oncotic pressure gradient would have no effect on water movement. For an intermediate value of $\\sigma$, the *effective* oncotic pressure difference opposing filtration is the nominal oncotic pressure difference scaled by $\\sigma$. This term is:\n$$ \\sigma (\\pi_c - \\pi_i) $$\n\nThe Net Filtration Pressure ($NFP$) is the algebraic sum of the hydrostatic forces promoting filtration and the effective oncotic forces opposing filtration. According to the stated principle and sign convention:\n$$ NFP = (\\text{Hydrostatic forces favoring filtration}) - (\\text{Effective oncotic forces opposing filtration}) $$\nSubstituting the mathematical expressions for these terms, we arrive at the general formula for the Net Filtration Pressure:\n$$ NFP = (P_c - P_i) - \\sigma (\\pi_c - \\pi_i) $$\nThis is the required expression.\n\nNow, we must evaluate the $NFP$ using the provided numerical values:\n- $P_c = 2\\ \\mathrm{kPa}$\n- $P_i = 0.5\\ \\mathrm{kPa}$\n- $\\pi_c = 1.5\\ \\mathrm{kPa}$\n- $\\pi_i = 0.2\\ \\mathrm{kPa}$\n- $\\sigma = 0.9$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived equation. All units of pressure are in kilopascals ($kPa$), and $\\sigma$ is dimensionless, so the units are consistent.\n$$ NFP = (2 - 0.5) - 0.9 \\times (1.5 - 0.2) $$\nFirst, we compute the differences within the parentheses:\n$$ \\Delta P = P_c - P_i = 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 $$\n$$ \\Delta \\pi = \\pi_c - \\pi_i = 1.5 - 0.2 = 1.3 $$\nNow, substitute these intermediate results back into the equation for $NFP$:\n$$ NFP = 1.5 - 0.9 \\times 1.3 $$\nNext, we perform the multiplication:\n$$ 0.9 \\times 1.3 = 1.17 $$\nFinally, we perform the subtraction:\n$$ NFP = 1.5 - 1.17 = 0.33 $$\nThe resulting Net Filtration Pressure is $0.33\\ \\mathrm{kPa}$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. To express $0.33$ with three significant figures, we write it as $0.330$. The positive value indicates that the net force favors filtration from the coelom into the metanephridial tubule, which is a biologically necessary condition for the function of this excretory organ.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.330}$$", "id": "2606294"}, {"introduction": "In contrast to pressure-driven filtration, the Malpighian tubules of insects form primary urine through active secretion, a process powered by potent electrochemical gradients.
