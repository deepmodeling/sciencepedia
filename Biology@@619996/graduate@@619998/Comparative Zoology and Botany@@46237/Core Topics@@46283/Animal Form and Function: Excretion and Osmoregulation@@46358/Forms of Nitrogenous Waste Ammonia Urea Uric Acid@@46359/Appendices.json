Consider two strategies for excreting nitrogen produced from amino acid catabolism: ammonotelism (excreting as ammonia, $\\mathrm{NH_3}$) and ureotelism (excreting as urea, $\\mathrm{CO(NH_2)_2}$). You are asked to compute the minimal urine volume required to excrete a fixed nitrogen load under concentration constraints that reflect toxicity (for free ammonia) and achievable osmolarity (for urea), using only fundamental definitions.\n\nAssume a vertebrate must excrete $n_{N} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mmol}$ of nitrogen. The urine of this organism can safely maintain a free ammonia concentration of at most $C_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}^{\\mathrm{free}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, and can maintain a urea concentration of up to $C_{\\mathrm{urea}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ without exceeding osmotic design limits. Assume that the urine is well mixed, at steady state, and that to minimize water volume the excreted solute is brought to its allowable concentration bound. Ignore any acid–base speciation beyond the stated limit on free $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ and assume that the excreted nitrogen is carried exclusively by the named solute in each case.\n\nStarting only from the definition of molarity $C = n/V$ and the stoichiometry of nitrogen atoms per molecule of the excreted solute, derive expressions for the minimal urine volumes $V_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{urea}}$ needed to excrete the given $n_{N}$ when nitrogen is excreted as ammonia versus as urea, respectively.

It poses a valid question in comparative physiology that can be resolved through the application of fundamental chemical and biological principles.

The minimal volume is achieved when the concentration of the excreted solute reaches its maximum allowable limit. The governing equation is the definition of molarity, $C = n_{\\mathrm{solute}}/V$, rearranged to solve for volume:\n$$\nV = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{solute}}}{C}\n$$\nTo minimize $V$, we must use the maximum permissible concentration, $C^{\\mathrm{max}}$. The key step is to relate the moles of solute, $n_{\\mathrm{solute}}$, to the fixed quantity of nitrogen atoms to be excreted, $n_{N}$, through stoichiometry. We are given $n_{N} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mmol} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}$.\n\n**Case 1: Ammonotelism (Excretion of Ammonia, $\\mathrm{NH_3}$)**\n\nFirst, we analyze the stoichiometry of ammonia. The molecule $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ contains one nitrogen atom. Consequently, to excrete $n_{N}$ moles of nitrogen atoms, an equal number of moles of ammonia must be excreted. Let $n_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}$ be the moles of ammonia.\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{NH_3}} = n_{N}\n$$\nGiven $n_{N} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}$, we have:\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{NH_3}} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\n$$\nThe maximum permissible concentration of free ammonia, dictated by its high toxicity, is given as $C_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}^{\\mathrm{free}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol/L}$.

The molecule $\\mathrm{CO(NH_2)_2}$ contains two nitrogen atoms. Therefore, to excrete $n_{N}$ moles of nitrogen atoms, only $n_{N}/2$ moles of urea are required. Let $n_{\\mathrm{urea}}$ be the moles of urea.\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{urea}} = \\frac{n_{N}}{2}\n$$\nWith $n_{N} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}$, we have:\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{urea}} = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}}{2} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\n$$\nThe maximum concentration of urea, limited by the organism's osmotic capabilities, is given as $C_{\\mathrm{urea}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 100 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol/L} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{mol/L}$.

This massive difference in water economy is a result of two compounding factors: the superior stoichiometric efficiency of urea in carrying nitrogen ($2$ atoms per molecule versus $1$), and the drastically lower toxicity of urea, which permits a $100$-fold higher concentration in urine compared to ammonia. The product of these factors, $2 \\times 100$, yields the total calculated advantage of $200$.

A complete solution will be furnished.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as demanded by the problem statement.\n\nPart 1: Timescale to Toxicity in an Impermeable Egg\nWe model the egg as a closed system with an internal volume $V$ and a constant rate of production of nitrogenous waste, $r_{N}$. Let $N(t)$ be the molar amount of waste and $C(t)$ be its concentration at time $t$. The relationship is $N(t) = C(t)V$.\nThe principle of mass conservation dictates that the rate of change of moles within the volume is equal to the rate of production, as there is no removal term in this scenario.\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = r_{N} $$\nSubstituting $N(t) = C(t)V$ and recognizing that the volume $V$ is constant, we have:\n$$ V \\frac{dC}{dt} = r_{N} $$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation. We solve it by separation of variables and integration, assuming the initial concentration is zero, $C(0)=0$.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{C(t)} dC' = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{r_{N}}{V} dt' $$\nThis yields the concentration as a function of time:\n$$ C(t) = \\frac{r_{N}}{V} t $$\nThe time required to reach the toxic threshold, $t_{\\mathrm{toxic}}$, is found by setting the concentration $C(t_{\\mathrm{toxic}})$ equal to the tolerance limit $C_{\\mathrm{tol}}$.\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{tol}} = \\frac{r_{N}}{V} t_{\\mathrm{toxic}} $$\nSolving for $t_{\\mathrm{toxic}}$ gives the expression:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{toxic}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{tol}} V}{r_{N}} $$\nSubstituting the provided numerical values:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{toxic}} = \\frac{(2.0 \\ \\mathrm{mol} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3})(4.5 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{3})}{2.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{mol} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{9.0 \\times 10^{-5}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-8}} \\mathrm{s} = 4.5 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{s} $$\nThis time is equivalent to $4500 \\ \\mathrm{s} \\times \\frac{1 \\ \\mathrm{hr}}{3600 \\ \\mathrm{s}} = 1.25 \\ \\mathrm{hours}$. Typical avian embryonic development spans weeks (e.g., $\\approx 21$ days for a chicken). A timescale of $1.25 \\ \\mathrm{hours}$ is orders of magnitude shorter than the development period, which demonstrates that without an effective removal or sequestration mechanism, toxic concentrations would be reached very rapidly.\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the Minimal Precipitation Fraction $f_{\\min}$\nWe now consider a system with both diffusive removal through the shell and sequestration via precipitation. We formulate a mass balance for the dissolved nitrogenous waste in the internal volume $V$.\nThe rate of change of dissolved moles is equal to the rate of production of dissolved waste minus the rate of removal by diffusion.\nThe total production rate is $r_{N}$. A fraction $f$ of this is sequestered into a solid phase. Therefore, the rate of production of *dissolved* waste is $(1-f)r_{N}$.\nThe rate of removal by diffusion is governed by Fick's first law. The molar flux $J$ (in $\\mathrm{mol} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) across the shell is given by:\n$$ J = -D \\frac{dC}{dx} $$\nFor a simple one-dimensional path of length $L$, we approximate the concentration gradient as $\\frac{\\Delta C}{L} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{out}} - C_{\\mathrm{in}}}{L}$. Here, $C_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is the internal dissolved concentration, which we will denote as $C_{\\mathrm{dissolved}}$, and $C_{\\mathrm{out}}$ is the external concentration, given as $C_{\\mathrm{out}} \\approx 0$.\n$$ J = -D \\frac{0 - C_{\\mathrm{dissolved}}}{L} = \\frac{D C_{\\mathrm{dissolved}}}{L} $$\nThe total molar rate of diffusive removal, $r_{\\mathrm{diffuse}}$, is the flux $J$ multiplied by the effective pore area $A$:\n$$ r_{\\mathrm{diffuse}} = J \\cdot A = \\frac{D A C_{\\mathrm{dissolved}}}{L} $$\nThe mass balance for the dissolved species is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{d(V C_{\\mathrm{dissolved}})}{dt} = (1-f)r_{N} - r_{\\mathrm{diffuse}} $$\n$$ V \\frac{dC_{\\mathrm{dissolved}}}{dt} = (1-f)r_{N} - \\frac{D A C_{\\mathrm{dissolved}}}{L} $$\nThe problem imposes two conditions. First, the system is at steady state, which means $\\frac{dC_{\\mathrm{dissolved}}}{dt} = 0$. Applying this to the mass balance equation gives:\n$$ 0 = (1-f)r_{N} - \\frac{D A C_{\\mathrm{dissolved}}}{L} $$\n$$ (1-f)r_{N} = \\frac{D A C_{\\mathrm{dissolved}}}{L} $$\nSecond, the dissolved concentration must not exceed the toxicity threshold, $C_{\\mathrm{dissolved}} \\le C_{\\mathrm{tol}}$. To find the *minimal* required precipitation fraction, $f_{\\min}$, we must consider the limiting case where the system operates at the maximum permissible concentration, i.e., $C_{\\mathrm{dissolved}} = C_{\\mathrm{tol}}$. This condition ensures just enough precipitation to prevent toxicity. Substituting $f = f_{\\min}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{dissolved}} = C_{\\mathrm{tol}}$ into the steady-state equation yields:\n$$ (1-f_{\\min})r_{N} = \\frac{D A C_{\\mathrm{tol}}}{L} $$\nWe now solve for $f_{\\min}$:\n$$ 1-f_{\\min} = \\frac{D A C_{\\mathrm{tol}}}{L r_{N}} $$\n$$ f_{\\min} = 1 - \\frac{D A C_{\\mathrm{tol}}}{L r_{N}} $$\nThis is the required symbolic expression.\n\nPart 3: Numerical Evaluation of $f_{\\min}$\nWe use the expression derived in Part 2 and substitute the given numerical values.

The problem requires rounding to $4$ significant figures.\n$$ f_{\\min} \\approx 0.6667 $$\nThis result signifies that approximately $66.67\\%$ of the produced nitrogenous waste must be converted into an insoluble solid (uric acid) to maintain the internal dissolved concentration at a non-toxic level under steady-state conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6667}$$", "id": "2574441"}]}
