Assume the following widely accepted bases:\n\n- In secretory salt gland tubules, chloride leaves the cell apically through CFTR, sodium follows predominantly paracellularly to satisfy electroneutrality, and water follows osmotically through the epithelium. Basolaterally, the sodium–potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase) and the sodium–potassium–two chloride cotransporter (NKCC1) sustain intracellular chloride loading and the electrochemical driving forces.\n- The transepithelial potential difference (TEPD) in an actively secreting salt gland is typically lumen-negative due to chloride secretion; the magnitude of this potential is determined by ion conductances and active transport.\n- The net transepithelial chloride secretion rate is limited by the apical chloride conductance and its electrochemical driving force; sodium flux follows to maintain electroneutrality, and water flux is tied to the transepithelial osmotic gradient.\n- On the time scale of hours to a day, renal excretion in birds and most marine reptiles cannot fully compensate for ingestion of seawater because their kidneys cannot produce urine that is more concentrated than seawater; thus salt glands are the primary route for excreting excess sodium chloride from seawater intake.\n- Conservation of mass implies that if intake of sodium chloride exceeds excretion, extracellular fluid sodium and chloride contents increase, thereby increasing extracellular osmolality.\n\nConsider a pelagic seabird drinking seawater of sodium chloride concentration $0.6\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$ at a rate adjusted such that, prior to exposure, the salt gland output matched intake at steady state (no net sodium chloride accumulation).

The roles of CFTR, NKCC1, and Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase are standard textbook physiology. The concept of a toxin acting as a channel inhibitor is a common theme in toxicology and pharmacology. The osmoregulatory limitations of marine birds and reptiles are factual. The problem is firmly grounded in comparative animal physiology and biophysics.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a clear initial steady state, a specific, quantifiable perturbation (a $60\\%$ reduction in a key conductance), a set of governing principles, and asks for the logical consequences. The structure allows for a unique, derivable solution based on the provided axioms.\n- **Objective**: The language used is precise, quantitative, and free from subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe problem requires an integrated analysis of the consequences of a specific molecular perturbation, propagating from the cellular level to the whole-organism level. The derivation proceeds by applying the given principles in sequence.\n\n1.  **Direct Effect on the Epithelium**: The primary perturbation is a $60\\%$ reduction in the apical chloride conductance, $G_{\\text{Cl,apical}}$. According to Principle 3, the net rate of transepithelial chloride secretion, $J_{\\text{Cl}}$, is limited by this conductance. The ion current for chloride is given by $I_{\\text{Cl}} = G_{\\text{Cl,apical}} \\times (V_m - E_{\\text{Cl}})$, where $V_m$ is the apical membrane potential and $E_{\\text{Cl}}$ is the Nernst potential for chloride. A drastic reduction in $G_{\\text{Cl,apical}}$ will commensurately reduce the chloride current and thus the secretion rate, $J_{\\text{Cl}}$.\n\n2.  **Coupled Fluxes**:\n    - **Sodium Flux**: Principle 1 states that sodium follows chloride predominantly via the paracellular pathway to maintain electroneutrality. A reduction in the flux of the principal anion (Cl⁻) will reduce the electrical driving force for the flux of the principal cation (Na⁺). Consequently, the paracellular sodium flux, $J_{\\text{Na}}$, must decline.\n    - **Water Flux**: Principle 1 also states that water movement is osmotic. The total solute flux is approximately $J_{\\text{solute}} \\approx J_{\\text{Na}} + J_{\\text{Cl}}$. Since both $J_{\\text{Na}}$ and $J_{\\text{Cl}}$ decrease, the total transepithelial solute flux decreases. This reduces the osmotic gradient driving water movement, causing the glandular fluid secretion rate (volume per unit time) to fall.\n\n3.  **Electrophysiological Changes**: Principle 2 states the lumen is typically negative due to chloride secretion. This lumen-negative TEPD is a direct result of the net movement of negative charge (Cl⁻) into the lumen. By reducing the conductance for this charge movement, the inhibitor impedes the generation of this potential. The lumen will become less negative relative to the blood side. Therefore, the *magnitude* of the lumen-negative TEPD decreases.\n\n4.  **Systemic Consequences**:\n    - **Salt Balance**: The seabird was in a steady state where salt intake from drinking seawater was balanced by salt gland excretion. The inhibitor has now impaired the primary excretion pathway. Since intake is unlikely to cease immediately, salt intake will exceed the now-reduced maximum excretion rate. This leads to a net retention of NaCl in the body.\n    - **Extracellular Osmolality**: According to Principle 5, when intake exceeds excretion, the sodium and chloride contents of the extracellular fluid (ECF) increase. This directly leads to an increase in ECF osmolality, a state known as hypernatremia and hyperchloremia.\n    - **Fluid Shifts**: An increase in ECF osmolality disrupts the osmotic equilibrium between the ECF and the intracellular fluid (ICF). Water moves via osmosis from the relatively hypotonic ICF to the hypertonic ECF. This causes cell shrinkage, or **intracellular dehydration**.\n    - **Acid-Base Balance**: The problem states the bird is retaining NaCl from seawater. Seawater is essentially a solution of NaCl, with a strong ion difference (SID) near zero. The SID of plasma is normally positive, approximately $([\\text{Na}^+] + [\\text{K}^+]) - [\\text{Cl}^-] \\approx (145 + 4) - 105 = 44\\,\\mathrm{mEq\\,L^{-1}}$. The retention of a fluid with a SID of zero will lower the plasma SID. According to the Stewart-Fencl model of acid-base physiology, a decrease in SID is a primary cause of metabolic acidosis because it forces a charge-balancing increase in the hydrogen ion concentration, $[H^+]$. Because this acidosis is accompanied by an elevation in plasma chloride, it is specifically a **hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis**.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The lumen-negative transepithelial potential decreases in magnitude, glandular fluid secretion rate falls, and paracellular sodium flux declines; systemic sodium and chloride contents increase, raising extracellular osmolality and predisposing to intracellular dehydration and a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis driven by a reduced strong ion difference.**\nThis option presents a sequence of events that precisely matches the step-by-step derivation above. Each component—the decrease in TEPD magnitude, fall in secretion rate and Na⁺ flux, systemic salt retention, subsequent hyperosmolality, intracellular dehydration, and hyperchloremic acidosis—is a direct and logical consequence of the initial CFTR inhibition based on the provided principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The inhibitor increases the concentration of the glandular fluid by uncoupling water permeability from ion flow, thereby normalizing systemic sodium chloride balance despite reduced conductance; the transepithelial potential remains unchanged, and extracellular osmolality is stable.**\nThis option is flawed. The problem explicitly states there are no effects on aquaporins, so there is no \"uncoupling\" of water permeability. The TEPD cannot remain unchanged when the primary charge-carrying conductance is reduced by $60\\%$. Normalizing salt balance is impossible if the maximum secretion rate is crippled. Consequently, extracellular osmolality cannot remain stable.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. By reducing apical chloride exit, the inhibitor diverts secretion to sodium bicarbonate via upregulated apical chloride–bicarbonate exchange, producing metabolic alkalosis and hypochloremia while maintaining overall salt excretion near baseline.**\nThis option invokes a compensatory mechanism (apical Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchange) that is not mentioned in the problem's principles. Such a mechanism is not the primary mode of secretion in these glands. Rapid \"upregulation\" is speculative. The predicted systemic effects (metabolic alkalosis, hypochloremia) are the opposite of what is expected from NaCl retention. Maintaining salt excretion near baseline is implausible given the magnitude of the inhibition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The inhibitor has minimal impact because salt glands primarily use apical potassium channels for chloride exit; sodium chloride balance and osmolality remain near normal, but plasma potassium falls due to increased basolateral potassium recycling.**\nThis option makes a fundamentally false assertion that contradicts Principle 1: it claims potassium channels transport chloride. This is a basic scientific error. CFTR is stated to be the apical chloride channel. All subsequent conclusions are based on this false premise.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Chronic exposure over hours upregulates basolateral NKCC1 sufficiently to restore the original chloride secretory current despite the apical conductance block, preventing systemic ion imbalance without altering transepithelial potential or flow.**\nThis option misunderstands the rate-limiting step. The problem states the apical conductance is the bottleneck. Increasing the basolateral loading of chloride via NKCC1 cannot force more chloride through the now-restricted apical exit. It is like trying to relieve a traffic jam on a bridge by sending more cars to the on-ramp. One cannot \"restore the original chloride secretory current\" by acting on a non-limiting step. The timescale for significant protein upregulation is also likely longer than \"several hours\".\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2608370"}]}
