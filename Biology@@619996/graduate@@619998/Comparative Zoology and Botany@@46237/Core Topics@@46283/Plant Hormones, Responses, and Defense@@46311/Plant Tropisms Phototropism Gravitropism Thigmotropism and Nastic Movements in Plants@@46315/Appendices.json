All necessary parameters are provided, and they are physically plausible. The problem is a direct application of fundamental principles of fluid mechanics to a biological context, specifically the sedimentation of amyloplasts during gravitropism. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nWe begin by modeling the amyloplast as a rigid sphere of radius $r$ and mass density $\\rho_{p}$, settling in a fluid (cytoplasm) of mass density $\\rho_{f}$ and dynamic viscosity $\\eta$. The forces acting on the sphere are the gravitational force ($F_{g}$), the buoyant force ($F_{b}$), and the viscous drag force ($F_{d}$).\n\nThe gravitational force is given by the mass of the particle, $m_{p}$, multiplied by the gravitational acceleration, $g$. The mass is the product of its density $\\rho_{p}$ and volume $V_{p} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^{3}$.\n$$\nF_g = m_{p} g = \\rho_{p} V_{p} g = \\rho_{p} \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^{3}\\right) g\n$$\nThis force acts vertically downward.\n\nThe buoyant force is given by Archimedes' principle, which states that the upward buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the sphere.\n$$\nF_b = m_{f} g = \\rho_{f} V_{p} g = \\rho_{f} \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^{3}\\right) g\n$$\nThis force acts vertically upward.\n\nThe viscous drag force, under the assumption of low Reynolds number (creeping flow), is described by Stokes' law for a sphere:\n$$\nF_d = 6 \\pi \\eta r v\n$$\nwhere $v$ is the velocity of the sphere relative to the fluid. This force opposes the motion, so it acts vertically upward as the particle settles.\n\nThe amyloplast reaches terminal velocity, $v_{t}$, when the net force on it is zero. At this point, the downward gravitational force is exactly balanced by the sum of the upward buoyant and drag forces.\n$$\nF_{net} = F_g - F_b - F_d = 0\n$$\n$$\nF_g = F_b + F_d\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the forces:\n$$\n\\rho_{p} \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^{3}\\right) g = \\rho_{f} \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^{3}\\right) g + 6 \\pi \\eta r v_{t}\n$$\nWe can now solve for the terminal velocity, $v_{t}$.\n$$\n6 \\pi \\eta r v_{t} = \\left(\\rho_{p} - \\rho_{f}\\right) \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^{3}\\right) g\n$$\n$$\nv_{t} = \\frac{(\\rho_{p} - \\rho_{f}) \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^{3}\\right) g}{6 \\pi \\eta r}\n$$\n$$\nv_{t} = \\frac{4 \\pi r^{3} g (\\rho_{p} - \\rho_{f})}{18 \\pi \\eta r} = \\frac{2 r^{2} g (\\rho_{p} - \\rho_{f})}{9 \\eta}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the terminal settling velocity.\n\nTo find the time $t$ required for the amyloplast to sediment a vertical distance $L$, we must make an additional justified assumption: the particle reaches terminal velocity practically instantaneously compared to the total sedimentation time. Therefore, we can treat the velocity as constant and equal to $v_{t}$ over the entire distance $L$.

The Reynolds number is defined as $Re = \\frac{\\rho_{f} v D}{\\eta}$, where $D$ is the characteristic diameter of the particle, $D = 2r$.

We shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires us to model the hypocotyl as a slender beam under bending, for which the Euler–Bernoulli assumptions are applicable. A fundamental kinematic assumption of this theory is that plane cross-sections, initially perpendicular to the beam's neutral axis, remain plane and perpendicular to the neutral axis after bending. A direct consequence of this assumption is that the longitudinal normal strain, $\\epsilon_{x}$, varies linearly through the thickness of the beam.\n\nLet $y$ represent the transverse coordinate, measured from the neutral axis, which by definition passes through the centroid of the cross-section.

The problem describes a model for gravitropism based on two principles.\n\nFirst, \"The magnitude of the gravitropic stimulus is proportional to the component of the gravitational acceleration that is perpendicular to the organ’s long axis.\" Let the local vertical be oriented along an axis, and let the gravitational acceleration vector be $\\vec{g}$, with magnitude $\\|\\vec{g}\\| = g$. Let the shoot organ's axis be represented by a unit vector $\\hat{u}$. The angle between the organ's axis and the vertical is $\\theta$. The component of $\\vec{g}$ perpendicular to the organ's axis has a magnitude $g_{\\perp} = g |\\sin(\\theta)|$. Therefore, the magnitude of the stimulus, let us call it $S_{mag}$, is proportional to $g |\\sin(\\theta)|$.\n\nSecond, \"The rate of change of the tilt angle is proportional to the negative of the stimulus, with proportionality constant $k$ (a positive constant with units of inverse time).\" This statement implies a dynamic equation for $\\theta(t)$. However, a direct application leads to a dimensional inconsistency. The rate of change of an angle, $\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}$, has units of $[rad] \\cdot [s]^{-1}$. The stimulus, being proportional to an acceleration component, would have units of $[m] \\cdot [s]^{-2}$. If we write $\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} \\propto -S$, the proportionality constant must have units of $[s] \\cdot [m]^{-1}$, which contradicts the given units of $k$, which are $[s]^{-1}$.\n\nTo resolve this, a dimensionless formulation of the stimulus is required. This is standard practice in biophysical modeling. We define a dimensionless stimulus by normalizing the perpendicular component of acceleration, $g_{\\perp}$, by the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration, $g$. Thus, the dimensionless stimulus magnitude is $S_{mag} = \\frac{g_{\\perp}}{g} = |\\sin(\\theta)|$. Now, the dynamic equation can be written as $\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = -k S$, where $S$ is a dimensionless stimulus and $k$ has the required units of $[s]^{-1}$.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase \"negative of the stimulus\" implies a restorative process, meaning the system must return to its equilibrium state at $\\theta=0$. If we were to use the magnitude of the stimulus, $S = |\\sin(\\theta)|$, the resulting equation would be $\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = -k |\\sin(\\theta)|$. For an initial negative angle (e.g., $\\theta  0$), this equation would yield $\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}  0$, causing the organ to bend further away from the vertical, which is biologically incorrect. The corrective growth must oppose the deviation from the vertical. The dynamic equation must therefore depend on the sign of $\\theta$. The correct formulation reflecting this restorative nature is $\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = -k \\sin(\\theta)$. This means the effective stimulus $S$ driving the dynamics must be the signed quantity $S(\\theta) = \\sin(\\theta)$, which is positive for $\\theta0$ (driving $\\theta$ down) and negative for $\\theta0$ (driving $\\theta$ up). This physically necessary interpretation resolves the ambiguity in the problem statement. The problem is thus deemed valid and can be solved.\n\na) Derivation of the gravitropic stimulus $S(\\theta)$.\nAs established during validation, the stimulus term in the rate equation must be a dimensionless, signed quantity to ensure both dimensional consistency and correct physical behavior. The magnitude of the gravitational component perpendicular to the organ axis is $g_{\\perp} = g |\\sin(\\theta)|$. We define the dimensionless stimulus magnitude by dividing by $g$.
