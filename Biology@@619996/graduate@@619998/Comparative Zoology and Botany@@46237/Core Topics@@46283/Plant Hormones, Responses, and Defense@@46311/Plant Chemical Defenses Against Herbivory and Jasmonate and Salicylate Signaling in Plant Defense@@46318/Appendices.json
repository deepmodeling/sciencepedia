By translating the metabolic cost of defense into an equivalent loss of biomass, you will develop a tangible understanding of the resource constraints that shape plant evolution and ecology.", "problem": "A jasmonic acid (JA)-inducible defense in Nicotiana tabacum is the biosynthesis of nicotine, which competes with structural growth for limited carbon. Consider a vegetative tobacco plant under steady environmental conditions in which defense is induced by jasmonic acid (JA) without concomitant activation of salicylic acid (SA) signaling, so that cross-pathway interactions can be neglected for the time window considered. Assume that, over the short induction window, gross photosynthesis and maintenance respiration do not change measurably; thus, the additional carbon invested in nicotine must be reallocated from the pool otherwise available for growth.\n\nUse the following fundamental bases and definitions:\n- Conservation of mass for plant carbon balance: at steady state on the short time scale of interest, the available post-maintenance carbon equals the sum of carbon allocated to growth, secondary metabolites (here, nicotine), and any transient storage.\n- Biomass construction requires both incorporation of carbon into biomass and growth-associated respiration. Let the carbon content of dry biomass be $f_{C}$ (grams carbon per gram dry biomass) and the growth-respiration coefficient be $g$ (grams carbon respired per gram dry biomass formed). Then the carbon cost to construct $1$ gram of dry biomass is $f_{C} + g$ grams carbon.\n- Nicotine has chemical formula $\\mathrm{C}_{10}\\mathrm{H}_{14}\\mathrm{N}_{2}$. Its carbon mass fraction $\\phi_{n}$ is determined by atomic composition. Use atomic masses $M_{\\mathrm{C}} = 12.011$, $M_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1.008$, and $M_{\\mathrm{N}} = 14.007$ (all in unified atomic mass units, equivalent to grams per mole).\n- Beyond the carbon contained in nicotine, suppose an additional construction respiration cost of $c_{n}$ grams carbon per gram nicotine is required to synthesize nicotine (reflecting reductant and energy demands). This cost is released as $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and is therefore unavailable for growth.\n\nAssume the following parameter values, representative of herbaceous dicot growth under non-stressed conditions:\n- $f_{C} = 0.45$\n- $g = 0.20$\n- $c_{n} = 0.20$\n\nLet $x$ be the mass of nicotine synthesized, in milligrams. Starting from the above carbon balance principles and definitions (and without assuming any direct change in assimilation or maintenance respiration), derive an analytic expression for the opportunity cost in foregone structural dry biomass, in milligrams, as a function of $x$. You must explicitly compute the carbon mass fraction of nicotine $\\phi_{n}$ from its formula and the given atomic masses.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single simplified analytic expression of $x$, with the numerical coefficient rounded to four significant figures.

Do not substitute any numerical value for $x$.", "solution": "We begin from the conservation of mass applied to plant carbon on the short induction time window. Let the post-maintenance carbon pool be $C_{\\mathrm{avail}}$ (grams carbon). Under the assumption that gross photosynthesis and maintenance respiration are unchanged by the short-term induction, a marginal increase in carbon allocated to nicotine must be offset by a marginal decrease in carbon allocated to growth. Therefore, the opportunity cost in foregone growth equals the amount of dry biomass that could have been constructed from the same amount of carbon that is invested (both stored and respired) in nicotine synthesis.\n\nTo convert between masses of compounds and carbon equivalents, we first compute the carbon mass fraction of nicotine, $\\phi_{n}$.

There are two components:\n- The carbon contained in nicotine itself, equal to $\\phi_{n}$ grams carbon per gram nicotine.\n- The construction respiration required to synthesize nicotine, equal to $c_{n}$ grams carbon (as $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$) per gram nicotine.\n\nThus, the total carbon diverted to nicotine synthesis per gram nicotine is\n$$\n\\phi_{n} + c_{n}.\n$$\nLet $M_{n}$ be the mass of nicotine synthesized, in grams. Then the total carbon diverted is\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{div}} = (\\phi_{n} + c_{n}) M_{n}.\n$$\nThis carbon would otherwise have been available for growth. The carbon requirement to form dry biomass is $f_{C} + g$ grams carbon per gram dry biomass (where $f_{C}$ supplies the biomass carbon and $g$ accounts for growth-associated respiration). Therefore, the mass of dry biomass foregone, $M_{\\mathrm{lost}}$ (grams), is\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{lost}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{div}}}{f_{C} + g} = \\frac{\\phi_{n} + c_{n}}{f_{C} + g} \\, M_{n}.\n$$\nWe now substitute the parameter values and the expression for $\\phi_{n}$.
