The numerical values provided are physically plausible for such a biological system. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific fact. The problem will now be solved.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the fractional receptor occupancy, $f$, in terms of the free gibberellin concentration, $[G]$, and the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$.\n\nWe begin with the provided definitions:\nThe fractional occupancy is defined as the ratio of the concentration of the bound receptor complex, $[RG]$, to the total receptor concentration, $[R]_T$.\n$$f = \\frac{[RG]}{[R]_T}$$\n\nThe total receptor concentration is the sum of the concentrations of the free receptor, $[R]$, and the bound receptor complex, $[RG]$.\n$$[R]_T = [R] + [RG]$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $[R]_T$ into the equation for $f$ gives:\n$$f = \\frac{[RG]}{[R] + [RG]}$$\n\nTo express $f$ in terms of $[G]$ and $K_d$, we must eliminate $[R]$ from this equation. We use the definition of the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[G][R]}{[RG]}$$\n\nFrom this definition, we can solve for the concentration of the free receptor, $[R]$:\n$$[R] = \\frac{K_d [RG]}{[G]}$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ back into the equation for $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{[RG]}{\\left(\\frac{K_d [RG]}{[G]}\\right) + [RG]}$$\n\nThe term $[RG]$ is common to all terms in the expression. We can factor $[RG]$ out of the denominator:\n$$f = \\frac{[RG]}{[RG] \\left(\\frac{K_d}{[G]} + 1\\right)}$$\n\nAssuming a non-trivial case where $[G] > 0$ and $[R]_T > 0$, it follows that $[RG] > 0$. We can therefore cancel the $[RG]$ term from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$f = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[G]} + 1}$$\n\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $[G]$:\n$$f = \\frac{1 \\cdot [G]}{\\left(\\frac{K_d}{[G]} + 1\\right) \\cdot [G]} = \\frac{[G]}{K_d + [G]}$$\n\nThis is the required expression for the fractional receptor occupancy, $f$, in terms of $[G]$ and $K_d$.

This practice moves from equilibrium to kinetics by modeling the steady-state abundance of DELLA proteins, the central repressors in the gibberellin pathway.

By contrast, cytokinins signal through a histidine kinase phosphorelay to type-B response regulators that can transcriptionally modulate target genes, including DELLA genes, thereby altering synthesis rates. Consider a cell-autonomous, well-mixed compartment in which the abundance of DELLA, denoted by $D(t)$, obeys a mass-balance with zero-order synthesis and first-order degradation. Assume the following foundational modeling assumptions, which are standard in biochemical kinetics: (i) synthesis occurs at a rate $k_{s}$ that is independent of $D$ over the timescale of interest, (ii) basal turnover occurs with first-order rate constant $k_{b}$, and (iii) gibberellin- and SLEEPY1-dependent targeting adds an additional first-order degradation pathway with effective rate constant $k_{g}$ in wild type, but this pathway is absent in a sly1 loss-of-function mutant.

The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe core of this problem rests on the mass-balance principle for the concentration of DELLA protein, denoted by $D(t)$.

Degradation is a first-order process with a total rate constant being the sum of the basal turnover rate constant, $k_{b}$, and the gibberellin-dependent rate constant, $k_{g}$. Thus, the rate of degradation is $(k_{b} + k_{g})D$. This leads to the following ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dD}{dt} = k_{s} - (k_{b} + k_{g})D\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the synthesis rate $k_{s}$ is modulated by cytokinin such that $k_{s} = c \\, k_{s}^{0}$, where $k_{s}^{0}$ is the basal synthesis rate and $c$ is a multiplicative factor.

Use the following foundational facts as the base for your reasoning: ligand-receptor recognition is mediated by specific interaction motifs; ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis requires substrate recruitment by an E$3$ ubiquitin ligase; and transcriptional outputs follow from the balance of repressor and activator activities in the nucleus as constrained by the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology. In wild-type gibberellin signaling, the Gibberellin Insensitive Dwarf $1$ (GID$1$) receptor binds gibberellin (GA), and the GA–GID$1$ complex recognizes the N-terminal DELLA motif to recruit the SCF$^{\\mathrm{SLY}1/\\mathrm{GID}2}$ E$3$ ubiquitin ligase, targeting DELLA proteins for degradation by the $26\\mathrm{S}$ proteasome.

The roles of GA, GID$1$, DELLA proteins (including the distinct functions of the DELLA and GRAS domains), and the SCF E$3$ ligase are correctly described. The concept of a dominant negative mutant lacking the ligand-interaction domain but retaining the functional domain is a classic concept in molecular biology and genetics. The setup is well-posed, providing a simplified but consistent quantitative model that, combined with the qualitative description, allows for a unique solution. The language is precise and objective. There are no contradictions, missing data, or scientifically unsound premises.\n\nStep 3: Verdict\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution can be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe solution requires three sequential deductions: determining the stability of the mutant protein, inferring its regulatory activity, and calculating the quantitative effect on GA$20$ox gene expression using the provided model.\n\n1.  **Stability of the Mutant DELLA Protein:**\n    The problem states that degradation of DELLA proteins is initiated when the GA–GID$1$ complex recognizes and binds to the N-terminal DELLA motif, which in turn recruits the SCF$^{\\mathrm{SLY}1/\\mathrm{GID}2}$ E$3$ ubiquitin ligase. The mutant protein is explicitly defined as lacking this DELLA motif. Consequently, the GA–GID$1$ complex, which is abundant under high GA conditions, has no site to bind on the mutant protein. Without this binding event, the E$3$ ligase cannot be recruited, and the mutant DELLA protein cannot be targeted for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the $26\\mathrm{S}$ proteasome. Therefore, the mutant DELLA protein will be stable and accumulate in the nucleus, irrespective of the gibberellin concentration.\n\n2.  **Regulatory Effect on GA-Responsive Growth Genes:**\n    DELLA proteins are specified to act as transcriptional repressors. This repressive function is associated with the C-terminal GRAS domain (which is biologically accurate, as it mediates interaction with transcription factors). The mutant protein retains an intact GRAS domain. Since the mutant protein is stable and accumulates to high levels (as determined in the point above), it will be functionally active as a repressor. It will constitutively bind to and repress its downstream targets, the GA-responsive growth-promoting transcription factors. Thus, activation of these growth genes will be continuously repressed.\n\n3.  **Calculation of GA$20$ox Fold-Change:**\n    First, we must establish the precise linear relationship between DELLA activity ($D$) and GA$20$ox expression ($E$) from the given data. The relationship is of the form $E(D) = mD + c$.\n    We are given:\n    - When $D=0$, $E=0.2$. This gives $E(0) = m(0) + c = 0.2$, so the intercept is $c=0.2$.\n    - When $D=1$, $E=1.0$. This gives $E(1) = m(1) + 0.2 = 1.0$, so the slope is $m = 1.0 - 0.2 = 0.8$.\n    The governing model is therefore: $E(D) = 0.8D + 0.2$.\n\n    Next, we calculate the GA$20$ox expression level ($E$) for the two conditions to be compared.\n    - **Wild Type under High GA:** The problem states that under these conditions, $D_{\\mathrm{WT}}^{\\mathrm{high}} = 0.2$.\n      Using our model, the corresponding expression level is:\n      $$E_{\\mathrm{WT}}^{\\mathrm{high}} = 0.8 \\times (0.2) + 0.2 = 0.16 + 0.2 = 0.36$$\n\n    - **Mutant under High GA:** As established, the mutant DELLA protein is stable and accumulates. Its activity will be maximal. In the context of the normalized model, maximal activity corresponds to $D=1$. This is also consistent with the provided information that low GA in wild type (which also causes DELLA accumulation) results in $D_{\\mathrm{WT}}^{\\mathrm{low}} = 1.0$. Thus, for the mutant, $D_{\\mathrm{mutant}}^{\\mathrm{high}} = 1.0$.\n      The corresponding expression level is:\n      $$E_{\\mathrm{mutant}}^{\\mathrm{high}} = 0.8 \\times (1.0) + 0.2 = 0.8 + 0.2 = 1.0$$\n\n    Finally, we compute the fold-change of the mutant relative to the wild type, both under high GA.\n    $$\\text{Fold-Change} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{mutant}}^{\\mathrm{high}}}{E_{\\mathrm{WT}}^{\\mathrm{high}}} = \\frac{1.0}{0.36} = \\frac{1}{36/100} = \\frac{100}{36} = \\frac{25}{9}$$\n    Numerically, this is $25 \\div 9 \\approx 2.777...$, which is approximately $2.78$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n- **A. The mutant DELLA is stable despite high GA; GA-responsive growth gene activation remains repressed; GA$20$ox rises to $E=1.0$, yielding a $\\dfrac{1.0}{0.36}=\\dfrac{25}{9}\\approx 2.78$-fold increase over wild type under high GA.**\n  This option correctly identifies that the mutant protein is stable due to the missing DELLA motif. It correctly deduces that its repressive function remains intact, thus repressing growth genes. Finally, it correctly calculates the resulting GA$20$ox expression level to be $E=1.0$ and the fold-change relative to wild type ($E=0.36$) as $\\frac{1.0}{0.36} \\approx 2.78$. All parts of this statement are consistent with our derivation.\n  Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n- **B. The mutant DELLA is degraded under high GA; GA-responsive growth genes are activated; GA$20$ox remains at $E=0.36$, for a fold-change of $1.0$ relative to wild type under high GA.**\n  This option incorrectly claims the mutant protein is degraded. Degradation requires the DELLA motif, which is absent. This initial error invalidates the subsequent conclusions regarding gene activation and GA$20$ox levels.\n  Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **C. The mutant DELLA is stable under high GA; GA-responsive growth genes are repressed; however, high GA overrides feedback so GA$20$ox is reduced to $E=0.2$, giving a fold-change of approximately $\\dfrac{0.2}{0.36}\\approx 0.56$ relative to wild type under high GA.**\n  This option correctly assesses the stability and repressive function. However, it introduces a mechanism—\"high GA overrides feedback\"—that is not supported by the problem statement. The problem provides a strict model where $E$ is a function of $D$ only. According to this model, high DELLA activity ($D=1.0$) must lead to high GA$20$ox expression ($E=1.0$), not a reduction to the basal level of $E=0.2$.\n  Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D. The mutant DELLA is stable under high GA but becomes transcriptionally inert because the DELLA motif is required for co-repressor function; GA$20$ox expression is unchanged by DELLA and thus unaltered from wild type under high GA.**\n  This option correctly identifies stability but incorrectly assigns the repressor function to the DELLA motif. The problem implies (and it is biologically correct) that the GRAS domain, which is intact in the mutant, is responsible for repression. The claim that the protein is \"transcriptionally inert\" is false.\n  Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2578587"}]}
