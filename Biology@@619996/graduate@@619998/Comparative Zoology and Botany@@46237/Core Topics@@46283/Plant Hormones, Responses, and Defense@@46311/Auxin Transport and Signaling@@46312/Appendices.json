It uses established principles of acid-base chemistry (the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation) and transport biology. The provided data are quantitative and the parameters ($pH$, $pK_a$) are realistic. The assumptions serve to construct a well-posed problem that can be solved analytically from the given information. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and requires non-trivial reasoning based on first principles. No scientific, logical, or structural flaws are detected.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe total initial influx ($V_{total}$) of a weak-acid auxin into a cell is the sum of two components: passive diffusion of the undissociated acid (HA) and carrier-mediated transport of the anion (A⁻).\n$$V_{total} = V_{passive} + V_{carrier}$$\nBased on the problem's assumptions, specifically (iii) and (iv), the primary influx carrier is AUX1, and the *aux1* loss-of-function mutant lacks this component of influx. Therefore, we can state:\n- For Wild Type (WT): $V_{WT} = V_{passive} + V_{AUX1}$\n- For *aux1* mutant: $V_{aux1} = V_{passive}$\n\nFrom this, the contribution of AUX1-mediated transport can be calculated as $V_{AUX1} = V_{WT} - V_{aux1}$.\n\nThe rate of passive diffusion, $V_{passive}$, is proportional to the concentration of the membrane-permeable undissociated species (HA) in the apoplast. The fraction of auxin in its undissociated form, $\\alpha_{HA}$, at a given pH is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n$$pH = pK_a + \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{A}^-]}{[\\mathrm{HA}]} \\right)$$\nThe fraction $\\alpha_{HA}$ is given by:\n$$\\alpha_{HA} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{HA}]}{[\\mathrm{HA}] + [\\mathrm{A}^-]} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{A}^-]}{[\\mathrm{HA}]}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{(pH - pK_a)}}$$\n\nWe will now apply these principles to both IAA and 2,4-D.\n\n**1. Analysis of Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)**\n-   **Physicochemical Properties**:\n    Given $pH_{\\mathrm{apo}} = 5.5$ and $pK_a(\\mathrm{IAA}) = 4.75$.\n    The fraction of undissociated IAA (IAAH) is:\n    $$\\alpha_{\\mathrm{IAAH}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{(5.5 - 4.75)}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{0.75}}$$\n    Since $10^{0.75} \\approx 5.623$,\n    $$\\alpha_{\\mathrm{IAAH}} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 5.623} = \\frac{1}{6.623} \\approx 0.151$$\n    Approximately $15.1\\%$ of IAA exists as the undissociated, membrane-permeable acid IAAH in the apoplast. The remaining $84.9\\%$ exists as the anion IAA⁻.\n\n-   **Transport Components**:\n    Using the experimental data:\n    -   $V_{WT}(\\mathrm{IAA}) = 2.50\\ \\mathrm{pmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$\n    -   $V_{aux1}(\\mathrm{IAA}) = 1.51\\ \\mathrm{pmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$\n    The rate of passive diffusion is equivalent to the uptake in the mutant: $V_{passive}(\\mathrm{IAA}) = V_{aux1}(\\mathrm{IAA}) = 1.51\\ \\mathrm{pmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n    The rate of AUX1-mediated influx is: $V_{AUX1}(\\mathrm{IAA}) = V_{WT}(\\mathrm{IAA}) - V_{aux1}(\\mathrm{IAA}) = 2.50 - 1.51 = 0.99\\ \\mathrm{pmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n    For IAA, both passive diffusion ($1.51$) and AUX1-mediated transport ($0.99$) contribute significantly to total influx. The total influx is high. The question asks what limits *net accumulation*. Net accumulation is the result of influx minus efflux. Given such a high total influx, the cell's ability to maintain homeostasis and prevent toxic over-accumulation depends critically on the activity of efflux carriers (PINs/ABCBs). Thus, for IAA, the carrier-mediated efflux system is a key determinant and limiting factor for the net steady-state accumulation level.\n\n**2.

Over $99.8\\%$ exists as the anion 2,4-D⁻.\n\n-   **Transport Components**:\n    Using the experimental data:\n    -   $V_{WT}(2,4\\text{-}\\mathrm{D}) = 1.32\\ \\mathrm{pmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$\n    -   $V_{aux1}(2,4\\text{-}\\mathrm{D}) = 0.020\\ \\mathrm{pmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$\n    The rate of passive diffusion is: $V_{passive}(2,4\\text{-}\\mathrm{D}) = V_{aux1}(2,4\\text{-}\\mathrm{D}) = 0.020\\ \\mathrm{pmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n    The rate of AUX1-mediated influx is: $V_{AUX1}(2,4\\text{-}\\mathrm{D}) = V_{WT}(2,4\\text{-}\\mathrm{D}) - V_{aux1}(2,4\\text{-}\\mathrm{D}) = 1.32 - 0.020 = 1.30\\ \\mathrm{pmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n    For 2,4-D, passive diffusion is negligible, contributing only $0.020/1.32 \\approx 1.5\\%$ of the total influx. Influx is almost entirely dependent on the AUX1 carrier. Therefore, the process limiting the uptake and subsequent accumulation of 2,4-D is the activity of the AUX1 influx carrier.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Net accumulation of 2,4-D is limited by AUX1-mediated influx, whereas net accumulation of IAA is limited by carrier-mediated efflux; this follows because the undissociated fraction of 2,4-D at $pH_{\\mathrm{apo}}$ is minuscule, making passive entry negligible and uptake highly AUX1-dependent, while IAA’s larger undissociated fraction allows substantial entry without AUX1 so that efflux becomes limiting.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with our derived conclusions. For 2,4-D, its low $pK_a$ results in a very small undissociated fraction and negligible passive uptake, making influx via AUX1 the rate-limiting step for entry. For IAA, its higher $pK_a$ allows for substantial passive influx in addition to AUX1-mediated influx, leading to a high total influx rate; consequently, carrier-mediated efflux becomes the key step limiting net accumulation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Both IAA and 2,4-D net accumulation are limited by passive diffusion of the undissociated acid; the observed reductions in the aux1 mutant are secondary and do not reflect a transport limitation.**\nThis is incorrect. For 2,4-D, passive diffusion is minimal ($0.020$), and the vast majority of uptake ($1.30$) is via AUX1. The nearly complete loss of uptake in the *aux1* mutant demonstrates that AUX1-mediated transport is dominant and limiting, not passive diffusion. The reduction is not \"secondary\"; it is the primary effect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Net accumulation of both IAA and 2,4-D is limited by efflux via PIN/ABCB carriers; AUX1 contributes negligibly to initial uptake for both auxins under the stated conditions.**\nThis is incorrect. The statement that AUX1 contributes negligibly is factually wrong based on the data. For 2,4-D, AUX1 is responsible for $~98.5\\%$ of the initial uptake ($1.30/1.32$). For IAA, AUX1 is responsible for $~39.6\\%$ of uptake ($0.99/2.50$), which is a significant, not negligible, contribution.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Net accumulation of IAA is limited by AUX1-mediated influx, whereas 2,4-D accumulation is dominated by passive diffusion due to its lower $pK_a$, which increases its membrane permeability relative to IAA.**\nThis statement contains multiple errors. First, it reverses the roles of IAA and 2,4-D. Our analysis shows 2,4-D uptake is limited by AUX1 influx, not IAA. Second, it claims 2,4-D accumulation is dominated by passive diffusion, which is contradicted by the data ($V_{passive}(2,4\\text{-}\\mathrm{D}) = 0.020$ vs. $V_{total}(2,4\\text{-}\\mathrm{D}) = 1.32$). Third, the reasoning is flawed: a lower $pK_a$ for 2,4-D *decreases* the concentration of the passively diffusible undissociated form at $pH_{\\mathrm{apo}} = 5.5$, thereby *decreasing* passive flux, not increasing it.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2548511"}, {"introduction": "The directional flow of auxin between cells, known as polar auxin transport, is responsible for creating the morphogenetic gradients that pattern the entire plant body.

All parameters and objectives are clearly defined, and there are no internal contradictions or missing information, assuming the transport coefficients are defined as rate constants contributing to the change in concentration. We may therefore proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe system dynamics are governed by the conservation of the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in each of the two cells. Let $C_L(t)$ and $C_R(t)$ be the concentrations of IAA in the left and right cells, respectively, at time $t$. The rate of change of concentration in each cell is determined by the balance of production, degradation, and intercellular transport. The provided parameters are interpreted as follows: $r$ [concentration/time] is the volumetric production rate, $k_d$ [1/time] is the first-order degradation rate constant, and $P_{LR}$ and $P_{RL}$ [1/time] are the effective transport rate constants between the cells.\n\nThe governing ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the concentrations are thus:\n$$ \\frac{dC_L}{dt} = \\text{production} - \\text{degradation} - \\text{flux out} + \\text{flux in} $$\n$$ \\frac{dC_R}{dt} = \\text{production} - \\text{degradation} + \\text{flux in} - \\text{flux out} $$\nSubstituting the given kinetic forms, we obtain a system of two coupled linear ODEs:\n$$ \\frac{dC_L}{dt} = r - k_d C_L - P_{LR} C_L + P_{RL} C_R $$\n$$ \\frac{dC_R}{dt} = r - k_d C_R + P_{LR} C_L - P_{RL} C_R $$\n\nTo find the steady-state concentrations, we set the time derivatives to zero: $\\frac{dC_L}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dC_R}{dt} = 0$.

Substituting these into the second derived relation:\n$$ (k_d + 2P_{RL}) \\left(\\frac{2r}{k_d} + \\Delta C\\right) = (k_d + 2P_{LR}) \\left(\\frac{2r}{k_d} - \\Delta C\\right) $$\nExpanding and collecting terms with $\\Delta C$:\n$$ \\Delta C (k_d + 2P_{RL} + k_d + 2P_{LR}) = \\frac{2r}{k_d} (k_d + 2P_{LR} - (k_d + 2P_{RL})) $$\n$$ \\Delta C (2k_d + 2(P_{LR} + P_{RL})) = \\frac{2r}{k_d} (2P_{LR} - 2P_{RL}) $$\n$$ \\Delta C = \\frac{4r(P_{LR} - P_{RL})}{k_d \\cdot 2(k_d + P_{LR} + P_{RL})} = \\frac{2r(P_{LR} - P_{RL})}{k_d(k_d + P_{LR} + P_{RL})} $$\nThis is the general expression for the steady-state auxin gradient for any set of transport parameters $P_{LR}$ and $P_{RL}$.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the two specified cases.\n\nCase 1: Uniform distribution.\nThe parameters are $P_{LR} = P_0$ and $P_{RL} = P_0$.\n$$ \\Delta C_{\\text{uniform}} = \\frac{2r(P_0 - P_0)}{k_d(k_d + P_0 + P_0)} = \\frac{2r(0)}{k_d(k_d + 2P_0)} = 0 $$\nAs expected, a symmetric system yields no concentration gradient.\n\nCase 2: Apically biased distribution.\nThe parameters are $P_{LR} = (1 + \\beta) P_0$ and $P_{RL} = (1 - \\beta) P_0$.\nThe difference in permeabilities is $P_{LR} - P_{RL} = (1 + \\beta)P_0 - (1 - \\beta)P_0 = 2\\beta P_0$.\nThe sum of permeabilities is $P_{LR} + P_{RL} = (1 + \\beta)P_0 + (1 - \\beta)P_0 = 2P_0$.\nSubstituting these into the general expression for $\\Delta C$:\n$$ \\Delta C_{\\text{biased}} = \\frac{2r(2\\beta P_0)}{k_d(k_d + 2P_0)} = \\frac{4r\\beta P_0}{k_d(k_d + 2P_0)} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the required quantity, which is the difference in the gradients between the two cases:\n$$ \\Delta C_{\\text{biased}} - \\Delta C_{\\text{uniform}} = \\frac{4r\\beta P_0}{k_d(k_d + 2P_0)} - 0 $$\n$$ \\Delta C_{\\text{biased}} - \\Delta C_{\\text{uniform}} = \\frac{4r\\beta P_0}{k_d(k_d + 2P_0)} $$\nThis is the final expression, derived solely from the principles and parameters provided in the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{4 r \\beta P_0}{k_d (k_d + 2 P_0)}}$$", "id": "2548447"}]}
