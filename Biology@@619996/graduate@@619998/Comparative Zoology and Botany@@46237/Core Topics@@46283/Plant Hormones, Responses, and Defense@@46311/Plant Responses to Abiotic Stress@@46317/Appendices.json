According to Fick's first law of diffusion at steady state, this flux is the product of the conductance to CO$_2$ ($g_{sc}$) and the concentration gradient between the ambient air ($C_a$) and the intercellular spaces ($C_i$).\n\nThe equation is:\n$$A = g_{sc} (C_a - C_i)$$\nThe problem states that the stomatal conductance to CO$_2$, $g_{sc}$, is related to the stomatal conductance to water vapor, $g_{sw}$, by the ratio of their diffusivities in air, $\\phi$.\n$$g_{sc} = \\frac{g_{sw}}{\\phi}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $g_{sc}$ into the flux equation yields:\n$$A = \\frac{g_{sw}}{\\phi} (C_a - C_i)$$\nTo derive an explicit expression for $C_i$, we rearrange this equation. First, multiply both sides by $\\phi$ and divide by $g_{sw}$:\n$$\\frac{A \\phi}{g_{sw}} = C_a - C_i$$\nFinally, solving for $C_i$ gives the desired expression:\n$$C_i = C_a - \\frac{A \\phi}{g_{sw}}$$\nThis equation allows the calculation of the intercellular CO$_2$ concentration from measurable gas exchange parameters.\n\n**Task 2: Compute $C_{i,\\mathrm{ctrl}}$ and $C_{i,\\mathrm{dr}}$.**\nUsing the derived formula and the provided data, we compute $C_i$ for both control and drought conditions.

The calculated value $144$ already has three significant figures.\n\n**Task 3: Determine the binary indicator $L$.**\nThe indicator $L$ distinguishes between stomatal and biochemical limitations based on the direction of change in $C_i$ during drought stress.\n- Stomatal limitation: A reduction in $g_{sw}$ restricts CO$_2$ supply, causing $C_i$ to decrease.\n- Biochemical limitation: A reduction in the capacity of the Calvin cycle (e.g., RuBisCO activity) reduces CO$_2$ demand, causing $C_i$ to increase at a given conductance.\n\nWe compare $C_{i,\\mathrm{dr}}$ with $C_{i,\\mathrm{ctrl}}$:\n$C_{i,\\mathrm{dr}} = 144~\\mu\\text{mol mol}^{-1}$\n$C_{i,\\mathrm{ctrl}} \\approx 293.33~\\mu\\text{mol mol}^{-1}$\nClearly, $C_{i,\\mathrm{dr}} < C_{i,\\mathrm{ctrl}}$. The intercellular CO$_2$ concentration has decreased significantly under drought. This observation is consistent with stomatal closure being the dominant limitation on photosynthesis, as it reduces the supply of CO$_2$ to the carboxylation sites. According to the problem definition:\n- $L = 1$ if the condition is more consistent with stomatal limitation (indicated by a decrease in $C_i$).\n- $L = 0$ otherwise.\nSince $C_i$ decreased, the response is characteristic of stomatal limitation.

It provides all necessary parameters to derive and compute the hydraulic safety margin for the two specified plant species. I will now proceed with a solution from first principles.\n\nAccording to the Cohesion–Tension theory, water within the plant xylem is under tension, which is quantified by a negative water potential, $\\Psi$. A more negative value of $\\Psi$ corresponds to a greater tension, or suction. This tension is the fundamental driving force for water transport from the soil to the leaves, but it also elevates the risk of cavitation. Cavitation is the formation of gas embolisms within xylem conduits, which obstructs water flow and reduces the plant's hydraulic conductivity, $K$.\n\nThe parameter $P_{50}$ is defined as the water potential at which $50\\%$ of the maximum hydraulic conductivity is lost (i.e., $K(\\Psi=P_{50}) = 0.5 K_{\\max}$). It serves as a critical ecophysiological threshold, indicating a high risk of catastrophic, runaway embolism and subsequent hydraulic failure, potentially leading to plant mortality.\n\nA plant's hydraulic safety is determined by the relationship between its minimum experienced water potential under environmental stress, $\\Psi_{\\min}$, and its intrinsic vulnerability to cavitation, represented by $P_{50}$. A plant is considered to be operating in a hydraulically 'safe' state if its operating potential remains less negative than its failure threshold. In mathematical terms, the condition for safety is thus:\n$$\n\\Psi_{\\min} > P_{50}\n$$\nConversely, a plant enters a state of high risk, or an 'unsafe' state, if its operating water potential drops to or becomes more negative than the $P_{50}$ value:\n$$\n\\Psi_{\\min} \\le P_{50}\n$$\nWe are tasked to derive an expression for the hydraulic safety margin, HSM, that correctly encodes the sign convention where safety corresponds to a positive value and risk corresponds to a negative value. To achieve this, we define the margin as the arithmetic difference between the operating potential and the vulnerability threshold. Let us examine the definition:\n$$\n\\mathrm{HSM} = \\Psi_{\\min} - P_{50}\n$$\nIf the plant is in a safe condition ($\\Psi_{\\min} > P_{50}$), then the difference $\\Psi_{\\min} - P_{50}$ will be positive. For instance, if $\\Psi_{\\min} = -2~\\text{MPa}$ and $P_{50} = -4~\\text{MPa}$, then $\\mathrm{HSM} = (-2) - (-4) = +2~\\text{MPa}$.\nIf the plant is in an unsafe condition ($\\Psi_{\\min} < P_{50}$), then the difference $\\Psi_{\\min} - P_{50}$ will be negative. For instance, if $\\Psi_{\\min} = -2.5~\\text{MPa}$ and $P_{50} = -2.0~\\text{MPa}$, then $\\mathrm{HSM} = (-2.5) - (-2.0) = -0.5~\\text{MPa}$.\nThis definition, $\\mathrm{HSM} = \\Psi_{\\min} - P_{50}$, therefore correctly establishes the desired sign convention, where a larger positive value of HSM indicates a greater buffer against hydraulic failure. This is the formal expression we shall use.\n\nNow, we apply this derived formula to the two species described in the problem. For both species, the minimum diurnal operating water potential under the specified heat wave and high VPD conditions is given as $\\Psi_{\\min} = -1.8~\\text{MPa}$.\n\nFor species A, the vulnerability threshold is given as $P_{50,A} = -1.5~\\text{MPa}$. The hydraulic safety margin for species A, $\\mathrm{HSM_A}$, is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{HSM_A} = \\Psi_{\\min} - P_{50,A} = (-1.8~\\text{MPa}) - (-1.5~\\text{MPa}) = -0.3~\\text{MPa}\n$$\n\nFor species B, the vulnerability threshold is given as $P_{50,B} = -3.0~\\text{MPa}$. The hydraulic safety margin for species B, $\\mathrm{HSM_B}$, is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{HSM_B} = \\Psi_{\\min} - P_{50,B} = (-1.8~\\text{MPa}) - (-3.0~\\text{MPa}) = +1.2~\\text{MPa}\n$$\n\nTo determine which species is hydraulically safer, we must compare their respective safety margins:\n$$\n\\mathrm{HSM_A} = -0.3~\\text{MPa}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{HSM_B} = +1.2~\\text{MPa}\n$$\nSpecies A exhibits a negative safety margin. This signifies that under the given stress conditions, its minimum water potential has become more negative than its $P_{50}$ threshold. This means species A is operating in a state of severe hydraulic dysfunction, having already lost more than $50\\%$ of its conductive capacity, and is at a high risk of runaway embolism.\n\nIn contrast, species B exhibits a substantial positive safety margin. Its minimum water potential is still $1.2~\\text{MPa}$ less negative than its $P_{50}$ threshold.
