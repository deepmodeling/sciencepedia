{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding predator-prey dynamics involves recognizing that foraging is an economic behavior, governed by trade-offs between costs and benefits. This practice delves into the core of optimal foraging theory by modeling a predator's diet choice as a rate-maximization problem [@problem_id:2583230]. By deriving the functional relationships between encounter rates, handling times ($h_i$), and energy gains ($e_i$), you will explore the conditions under which a predator should specialize or generalize its diet, leading to a foundational and often surprising prediction about how environmental enrichment shapes a predator's strategy.", "problem": "A visually hunting generalist predator forages in a habitat with two prey types. Encounters with prey are assumed to follow a Poisson process derived from search theory: if the predator searches at a constant rate and prey are randomly distributed, then the encounter rate with prey type $i$ is $\\lambda_i = a_i N_i$, where $a_i$ is the encounter coefficient and $N_i$ is the prey density. Upon capture, prey type $i$ yields energy $e_i$ after a handling time $h_i$, during which no searching occurs. The predator is rate-maximizing over a long time horizon and operates under a sequential-encounter, accept-or-reject decision rule.\n\nYou are given the following empirically estimated parameters:\n- Prey $1$: energy $e_1 = 12$ J, handling time $h_1 = 2.5$ s, encounter coefficient $a_1 = 0.015$ s$^{-1}$ (per unit density), baseline density $N_{1,0} = 80$.\n- Prey $2$: energy $e_2 = 5$ J, handling time $h_2 = 2.0$ s, encounter coefficient $a_2 = 0.020$ s$^{-1}$ (per unit density), baseline density $N_{2,0} = 50$.\n\nAssume enrichment scales both prey densities in fixed proportion, so that $N_i(s) = s\\,N_{i,0}$ for an enrichment factor $s > 0$, and thus $\\lambda_i(s) = a_i s N_{i,0}$. Assume further that prey are ranked by profitability, so that prey $1$ is more profitable than prey $2$ in the sense that $e_1/h_1 > e_2/h_2$.\n\nStarting only from the fundamental definitions of encounter rate, time budgets for search and handling, and the long-run average intake rate over renewal cycles, do the following:\n- Derive the long-run average intake rate when the predator accepts only prey $1$ and rejects prey $2$.\n- From first principles, derive the condition under which it is optimal to accept prey $2$ upon encounter, given that prey $1$ is always accepted. Use this to show whether the acceptance decision for prey $2$ depends on $\\lambda_2$.\n- Using your derived condition, determine the critical enrichment factor $s^{\\ast}$ at which the predator switches between including and excluding prey $2$ in the optimal diet. That is, find the unique $s^{\\ast}$ such that for $s < s^{\\ast}$ the optimal diet includes prey $2$, while for $s > s^{\\ast}$ the optimal diet excludes prey $2$.\n\nExpress the final $s^{\\ast}$ as a dimensionless number rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem presented is a classic application of optimal foraging theory, specifically the diet choice model, which is grounded in established principles of behavioral ecology and is well-posed. The provided parameters are physically and dimensionally consistent, and the profitability ranking $e_1/h_1 > e_2/h_2$ is confirmed by the data: $12/2.5 = 4.8$ J/s and $5/2.0 = 2.5$ J/s, so $4.8 > 2.5$. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be constructed from first principles as required.\n\nThe analysis proceeds in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we derive the long-run average intake rate for a predator that consumes only prey type $1$. This is a \"specialist\" strategy. The foraging process is a sequence of renewal cycles, each consisting of a search phase and a handling phase. For a Poisson process with encounter rate $\\lambda_1$, the mean search time to find one item of prey $1$ is $1/\\lambda_1$. Upon capture, the item is handled for a time $h_1$. Thus, the total average time for one complete foraging cycle, $T_{cycle,1}$, is:\n$$T_{cycle,1} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_1} + h_1$$\nThe energy gained in this cycle is $e_1$. The long-run average rate of energy intake, denoted as $R_1$, is the total energy gained per cycle divided by the total time per cycle:\n$$R_1 = \\frac{e_1}{T_{cycle,1}} = \\frac{e_1}{\\frac{1}{\\lambda_1} + h_1}$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\lambda_1$ gives the final expression for the specialist intake rate:\n$$R_1 = \\frac{\\lambda_1 e_1}{1 + \\lambda_1 h_1}$$\n\nSecond, we derive the condition under which it is optimal to accept prey $2$ upon encounter. Since prey $1$ is more profitable ($e_1/h_1 > e_2/h_2$), it will always be included in the optimal diet. The decision is whether to add the less profitable prey $2$. This is a sequential decision made upon encountering an item of prey $2$. The predator must choose the action that maximizes its future rate of intake.\n\nThe two available actions upon encountering prey $2$ are:\n$1$. Accept prey $2$: The predator obtains an immediate energy gain of $e_2$ at a time cost of $h_2$.\n$2$. Reject prey $2$: The predator foregoes the capture of prey $2$ and continues to search. The alternative to capturing prey $2$ is to continue foraging according to the currently optimal strategy. If prey $2$ is rejected, the only prey type accepted is prey $1$. Therefore, the expected rate of energy gain from continuing to search is the specialist rate, $R_1$.\n\nThe decision rule is based on comparing the gain from accepting prey $2$ with the opportunity cost of doing so. The time $h_2$ spent handling prey $2$ could instead be used to forage as a specialist on prey $1$. The expected energy gain during this time $h_2$, if spent following the specialist strategy, is $R_1 h_2$. Therefore, it is optimal to accept prey $2$ if the energy gained, $e_2$, is greater than the expected energy that could have been gained in the same time, $R_1 h_2$.\nThe condition is:\n$$e_2 > R_1 h_2$$\nDividing by the handling time $h_2$ (which is a positive constant) gives the condition in terms of rates:\n$$\\frac{e_2}{h_2} > R_1$$\nThis result states that a less profitable prey item should be included in the diet if its profitability ($e/h$) is greater than the long-run average rate of intake from the diet composed of more profitable items.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $R_1$ that we derived earlier, the condition becomes:\n$$\\frac{e_2}{h_2} > \\frac{\\lambda_1 e_1}{1 + \\lambda_1 h_1}$$\nIt is of critical importance to observe that the encounter rate for prey $2$, $\\lambda_2$, does not appear anywhere in this inequality. The decision to include or exclude prey $2$ depends only on its own profitability ($e_2/h_2$) and the parameters of the more profitable prey $1$ (its profitability $e_1/h_1$, handling time $h_1$, and encounter rate $\\lambda_1$). Therefore, the acceptance decision for prey $2$ is independent of its own encounter rate $\\lambda_2$.\n\nThird, we determine the critical enrichment factor $s^{\\ast}$. The switch from a generalist diet (including prey $2$) to a specialist diet (excluding prey $2$) occurs at the threshold where the predator is indifferent between the two choices. This is the point where the inequality becomes an equality:\n$$\\frac{e_2}{h_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_1 e_1}{1 + \\lambda_1 h_1}$$\nWe are given that $\\lambda_1$ depends on the enrichment factor $s$ according to $\\lambda_1(s) = a_1 s N_{1,0}$. Let $s^{\\ast}$ be the critical enrichment factor at which the switch occurs. We substitute $\\lambda_1(s^{\\ast}) = a_1 s^{\\ast} N_{1,0}$ into a rearranged form of the equality. First, let's solve for $\\lambda_1$:\n$$ \\frac{e_2}{h_2} (1 + \\lambda_1 h_1) = \\lambda_1 e_1 $$\n$$ \\frac{e_2}{h_2} = \\lambda_1 e_1 - \\lambda_1 \\frac{e_2 h_1}{h_2} = \\lambda_1 \\left( e_1 - \\frac{e_2 h_1}{h_2} \\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{e_2}{h_2} = \\lambda_1 \\left( \\frac{e_1 h_2 - e_2 h_1}{h_2} \\right) $$\n$$ e_2 = \\lambda_1 (e_1 h_2 - e_2 h_1) $$\n$$ \\lambda_1 = \\frac{e_2}{e_1 h_2 - e_2 h_1} $$\nAt the critical point, this value of $\\lambda_1$ corresponds to $\\lambda_1(s^{\\ast})$:\n$$ a_1 s^{\\ast} N_{1,0} = \\frac{e_2}{e_1 h_2 - e_2 h_1} $$\nSolving for $s^{\\ast}$ yields:\n$$ s^{\\ast} = \\frac{e_2}{a_1 N_{1,0} (e_1 h_2 - e_2 h_1)} $$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n$e_1 = 12$ J, $h_1 = 2.5$ s, $a_1 = 0.015$ s$^{-1}$, $N_{1,0} = 80$.\n$e_2 = 5$ J, $h_2 = 2.0$ s.\n\nThe composite terms are:\n$$ a_1 N_{1,0} = 0.015 \\text{ s}^{-1} \\times 80 = 1.2 \\text{ s}^{-1} $$\n$$ e_1 h_2 - e_2 h_1 = (12)(2.0) - (5)(2.5) = 24 - 12.5 = 11.5 \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s} $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $s^{\\ast}$:\n$$ s^{\\ast} = \\frac{5 \\text{ J}}{(1.2 \\text{ s}^{-1})(11.5 \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s})} = \\frac{5}{13.8} $$\nThe value is a dimensionless factor, as expected.\n$$ s^{\\ast} \\approx 0.36231884... $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we obtain the critical enrichment factor.\n$$ s^{\\ast} \\approx 0.3623 $$\nFor $s < s^{\\ast}$, the encounter rate with prey $1$ is low, making the specialist strategy less profitable than the generalist one, so prey $2$ is included. For $s > s^{\\ast}$, the high encounter rate with prey $1$ makes specialization the superior strategy, so prey $2$ is excluded from the diet.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3623}$$", "id": "2583230"}, {"introduction": "Interspecific competition is not limited to shared resources; it often involves direct interference, such as through the production of inhibitory chemicals in a process known as allelopathy.

For species $2$ to successfully invade, its per capita growth rate must be positive when $N_{2} \\to 0$ and $N_{1} = 1$.\nThe condition is:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{1}{N_{2}}\\frac{dN_{2}}{dt} \\right|_{N_{2} \\to 0, N_{1}=1} > 0\n$$\nSubstituting into the per capita growth rate equation for species $2$:\n$$\nr_{2}(1 - 0 - \\alpha_{21}(N_{3}) \\cdot 1) > 0\n$$\nSince $r_2 > 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n1 - \\alpha_{21}(N_{3}) > 0 \\implies \\alpha_{21}(N_{3}) < 1\n$$\nThis is the condition for species $2$ to invade species $1$.\n\nFor stable coexistence under the mutual invasibility criterion, both conditions must be met simultaneously.\nCoexistence conditions:\n$$\n\\alpha_{12}(N_{3}) < 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\alpha_{21}(N_{3}) < 1\n$$\nThese inequalities characterize what is known as weak interspecific competition relative to intraspecific competition (which is normalized to $1$).\n\nNow, we substitute the given functional forms for the competition coefficients, which depend on the fixed microbial density $N_{3}$:\n$$\n\\alpha_{12}(N_{3}) = \\bar{\\alpha}_{12} - \\beta_{123} N_{3}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_{21}(N_{3}) = \\bar{\\alpha}_{21} - \\beta_{213} N_{3}\n$$\nThe coexistence conditions become a set of two inequalities for $N_{3}$:\n1. $\\bar{\\alpha}_{12} - \\beta_{123} N_{3} < 1$\n2. $\\bar{\\alpha}_{21} - \\beta_{213} N_{3} < 1$\n\nWe solve each inequality for $N_{3}$. Since $\\beta_{123}$ and $\\beta_{213}$ are given as positive, we can rearrange without changing the inequality direction.\nFrom inequality 1:\n$$\n\\bar{\\alpha}_{12} - 1 < \\beta_{123} N_{3} \\implies N_{3} > \\frac{\\bar{\\alpha}_{12} - 1}{\\beta_{123}}\n$$\nFrom inequality 2:\n$$\n\\bar{\\alpha}_{21} - 1 < \\beta_{213} N_{3} \\implies N_{3} > \\frac{\\bar{\\alpha}_{21} - 1}{\\beta_{213}}\n$$\nThese are the explicit inequalities for $N_3$ that ensure coexistence.\nFor both species to coexist, both conditions on $N_{3}$ must be satisfied. This means that $N_{3}$ must be greater than the larger of the two lower bounds. Let the two critical thresholds be:\n$$\nN_{3,1} = \\frac{\\bar{\\alpha}_{12} - 1}{\\beta_{123}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad N_{3,2} = \\frac{\\bar{\\alpha}_{21} - 1}{\\beta_{213}}\n$$\nThe condition for coexistence for any $N_3$ is $N_{3} > \\max(N_{3,1}, N_{3,2})$.\nThe minimal microbial density $N_{3}^{\\ast}$ above which coexistence is always predicted is therefore the maximum of these two values:\n$$\nN_{3}^{\\ast} = \\max\\left(\\frac{\\bar{\\alpha}_{12} - 1}{\\beta_{123}}, \\frac{\\bar{\\alpha}_{21} - 1}{\\beta_{213}}\\right)\n$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical parameter values:\n$$\n\\bar{\\alpha}_{12}=1.45,\\quad \\bar{\\alpha}_{21}=1.25,\\quad \\beta_{123}=0.30,\\quad \\beta_{213}=0.15\n$$\nNote that since $\\bar{\\alpha}_{12} > 1$ and $\\bar{\\alpha}_{21} > 1$, without the microbe ($N_3=0$), coexistence is impossible as the invasion conditions are not met. The microbe's role is to reduce competition to a level permitting coexistence.\n\nWe calculate the two threshold values:\n$$\nN_{3,1} = \\frac{1.45 - 1}{0.30} = \\frac{0.45}{0.30} = 1.5\n$$\n$$\nN_{3,2} = \\frac{1.25 - 1}{0.15} = \\frac{0.25}{0.15} = \\frac{25}{15} = \\frac{5}{3}\n$$\nTo compare these values, we can express $\\frac{5}{3}$ as a decimal: $\\frac{5}{3} \\approx 1.666...$\nThe minimal density $N_{3}^{\\ast}$ is the maximum of these two:\n$$\nN_{3}^{\\ast} = \\max\\left(1.5, \\frac{5}{3}\\right) = \\frac{5}{3}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nN_{3}^{\\ast} = \\frac{5}{3} \\approx 1.6666... \\approx 1.67\n$$\nThus, for any microbial density $N_{3} > 1.67$, the competitive interaction is weakened sufficiently for both plant species to invade each other when rare, leading to their stable coexistence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.67}$$", "id": "2583267"}]}
