The principles upon which it is based—conservation of mass, Fick's law of diffusion, and stoichiometry of metabolism—are fundamental to quantitative physiology. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe net rate of change of the lizard's body water mass, $\\frac{dm_w}{dt}$, is governed by the principle of mass conservation. It is the sum of all water gains minus the sum of all water losses.\n$$ \\frac{dm_w}{dt} = \\sum \\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\sum \\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{out}} $$\nIn this system, the only source of water gain is metabolic water production ($\\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{MWP}}$).

All necessary parameters are provided, and they are physiologically realistic for a terrestrial vertebrate. The problem is therefore valid and can be solved using the fundamental principles of renal physiology.\n\nThe task requires the derivation and calculation of two key physiological parameters: osmolar clearance ($C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$) and free water clearance ($C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}$), followed by an interpretation of the result in the context of terrestrial adaptation.\n\nFirst, we address the osmolar clearance, $C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$. The concept of clearance is defined as the virtual volume of a fluid (in this case, plasma) that is completely cleared of a given substance (in this case, total osmoles) per unit time. The principle of conservation of mass, applied at steady state, dictates that the rate at which a substance is removed from the plasma must equal the rate at which it is excreted in the urine.\n\nLet the rate of osmolar excretion be $\\dot{E}_{\\mathrm{osm}}$. This is given by the product of the urine osmolarity, $U_{\\mathrm{osm}}$, and the urine flow rate, $V$.\n$$\n\\dot{E}_{\\mathrm{osm}} = U_{\\mathrm{osm}} \\times V\n$$\nThe rate at which osmoles are cleared from the plasma is the product of the plasma osmolarity, $P_{\\mathrm{osm}}$, and the osmolar clearance, $C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$.\n$$\n\\text{Rate of clearance} = P_{\\mathrm{osm}} \\times C_{\\mathrm{osm}}\n$$\nBy conservation of osmoles at steady state, these two rates must be equal:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{osm}} \\times C_{\\mathrm{osm}} = U_{\\mathrm{osm}} \\times V\n$$\nFrom this fundamental relationship, we can derive the expression for osmolar clearance by isolating $C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{osm}} = \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{osm}} \\times V}{P_{\\mathrm{osm}}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given values into this expression. The given parameters are:\n- Urine flow rate, $V = 2\\ \\mathrm{mL\\,min^{-1}}$\n- Urine osmolarity, $U_{\\mathrm{osm}} = 1200\\ \\mathrm{mOsm\\,L^{-1}}$\n- Plasma osmolarity, $P_{\\mathrm{osm}} = 300\\ \\mathrm{mOsm\\,L^{-1}}$\n\nThe osmolarity units are identical ($\\mathrm{mOsm\\,L^{-1}}$) and will cancel, leaving the units of $V$ ($\\mathrm{mL\\,min^{-1}}$) for $C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$, as required.\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{osm}} = \\frac{1200\\ \\mathrm{mOsm\\,L^{-1}}}{300\\ \\mathrm{mOsm\\,L^{-1}}} \\times 2\\ \\mathrm{mL\\,min^{-1}} = 4 \\times 2\\ \\mathrm{mL\\,min^{-1}} = 8\\ \\mathrm{mL\\,min^{-1}}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the osmolar clearance is $8.00\\ \\mathrm{mL\\,min^{-1}}$. This value represents the volume of plasma cleared of all solutes per minute.\n\nSecond, we address the free water clearance, $C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}$. The problem defines this as the difference between the actual urine flow ($V$) and the isosmotic component of flow. The isosmotic component of flow is the volume of urine that would be required to excrete the given solute load if the urine were isosmotic with plasma. This theoretical volume is precisely what osmolar clearance, $C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$, represents. Therefore, the definition of free water clearance is:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = V - C_{\\mathrm{osm}}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = V - \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{osm}} \\times V}{P_{\\mathrm{osm}}} = V \\left(1 - \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{osm}}}{P_{\\mathrm{osm}}}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the given values and the previously computed value for $C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = 2\\ \\mathrm{mL\\,min^{-1}} - 8\\ \\mathrm{mL\\,min^{-1}} = -6\\ \\mathrm{mL\\,min^{-1}}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the free water clearance is $-6.00\\ \\mathrm{mL\\,min^{-1}}$.\n\nThird, we must interpret the sign of the free water clearance. A negative value for $C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}$ signifies that the actual urine flow rate, $V$, is less than the osmolar clearance, $C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$. This condition, $V < C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$, arises when the urine is hyperosmotic relative to the plasma ($U_{\\mathrm{osm}} > P_{\\mathrm{osm}}$), which is the case here ($1200\\ \\mathrm{mOsm\\,L^{-1}} > 300\\ \\mathrm{mOsm\\,L^{-1}}$). To produce a concentrated urine, the kidney must reabsorb pure water (solute-free water) from the tubular fluid back into the circulation. The absolute value of the negative free water clearance, $|C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}|$, represents the rate at which this solute-free water is returned to the body. In this instance, the kidney is effectively reabsorbing $6\\ \\mathrm{mL}$ of pure water every minute.\n\nThis physiological state is known as antidiuresis. It is a critical water-conservation strategy. For terrestrial vertebrates, which face the constant challenge of dehydration from evaporative loss and limited access to fresh water, the ability to excrete metabolic wastes and excess electrolytes in a minimal volume of water is a paramount adaptation for survival. A negative free water clearance is therefore a hallmark of an organism that is actively conserving body water, a fundamental requirement for the successful terrestrialization of vertebrates. Conversely, a positive free water clearance would indicate the excretion of excess water in a dilute urine, a state known as diuresis, which would be detrimental in an environment where water is scarce.\n\nThe calculated values for osmolar clearance and free water clearance are $8.00\\ \\mathrm{mL\\,min^{-1}}$ and $-6.00\\ \\mathrm{mL\\,min^{-1}}$, respectively.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 8.00 & -6.00 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2614272"}, {"introduction": "Physiological adaptations are not isolated traits but are shaped by trade-offs between competing demands.

The first term is a constant and its derivative is zero.\n$$\\frac{dE}{dC_i} = \\frac{d}{dC_i} \\left( \\alpha V_i t_s C_i^2 - L_w L_p A_g R T t_s C_i + L_w L_p A_g R T t_s C_e + \\text{constant} \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{dE}{dC_i} = 2 \\alpha V_i t_s C_i - L_w L_p A_g R T t_s$$\nSetting the derivative to zero for the optimal concentration $C_i^{\\ast}$:\n$$2 \\alpha V_i t_s C_i^{\\ast} - L_w L_p A_g R T t_s = 0$$\n$$2 \\alpha V_i t_s C_i^{\\ast} = L_w L_p A_g R T t_s$$\nSince $t_s > 0$, we can divide both sides by $t_s$:\n$$2 \\alpha V_i C_i^{\\ast} = L_w L_p A_g R T$$\nSolving for $C_i^{\\ast}$:\n$$C_i^{\\ast} = \\frac{L_w L_p A_g R T}{2 \\alpha V_i}$$\nThe second derivative, $\\frac{d^2E}{dC_i^2} = 2 \\alpha V_i t_s$, is positive, confirming that $C_i^{\\ast}$ corresponds to a minimum. This expression for $C_i^{\\ast}$ is valid as long as $C_i^{\\ast} \\le C_e$. If the calculation yields $C_i^{\\ast} > C_e$, the optimal strategy would be to set $C_i = C_e$ to eliminate osmotic water loss entirely, as any further increase in $C_i$ would only increase synthesis cost without providing any osmotic benefit (as per the model which penalizes water loss, not gain).\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values to evaluate $C_i^{\\ast}$:\n$L_w = 2.15 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n$L_p = 1.50 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}$\n$A_g = 8.00 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n$R = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n$T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$\\alpha = 2.00 \\times 10^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-2}$\n$V_i = 4.00 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}$\n\nThe numerator is:\n$$L_w L_p A_g R T = (2.15 \\times 10^{9}) \\cdot (1.50 \\times 10^{-12}) \\cdot (8.00 \\times 10^{-4}) \\cdot (8.314) \\cdot (298)$$\n$$= 6.3921 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$$\nThe denominator is:\n$$2 \\alpha V_i = 2 \\cdot (2.00 \\times 10^{-1}) \\cdot (4.00 \\times 10^{-5})$$\n$$= 1.60 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{m}^6\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-2}$$\nThus, the optimal concentration in SI units is:\n$$C_i^{\\ast} = \\frac{6.3921 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.60 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 399.5\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$$\nWe must check this against the external concentration $C_e = 9.00 \\times 10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$. Since $399.5 < 900$, our calculated value for $C_i^{\\ast}$ is physically meaningful and represents the true minimum.\n\nThe final step is to convert the units from $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$ to $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$ and round to three significant figures. Since $1\\,\\mathrm{m}^3 = 1000\\,\\mathrm{L}$, we have:\n$$C_i^{\\ast} = 399.5\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{m}^3}{1000\\,\\mathrm{L}} = 0.3995\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $0.400$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.400}$$", "id": "2544100"}]}
