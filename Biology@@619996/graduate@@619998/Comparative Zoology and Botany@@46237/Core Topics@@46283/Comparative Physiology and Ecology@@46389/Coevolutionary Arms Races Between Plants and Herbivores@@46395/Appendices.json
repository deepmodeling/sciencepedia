Both classes are biosynthesized from a single limiting precursor $P$ supplied by primary metabolism at a constant rate $J$ (moles of $P$ per unit biomass per unit time). The biosynthesis of one molecule of toxin $A$ requires $s_{A}$ molecules of $P$, and the biosynthesis of one molecule of toxin $B$ requires $s_{B}$ molecules of $P$, where $s_{A} > 0$ and $s_{B} > 0$ are stoichiometric coefficients determined by pathway chemistry.\n\nAssume the following widely accepted bases:\n- Mass conservation at steady state for the precursor pool: if the intracellular pool of $P$ is small and does not accumulate, then its supply rate equals its consumption rate by all sinks.\n- First-order loss (dilution or degradation) of toxins in the plant: for toxin $i \\in \\{A,B\\}$ with concentration $T_{i}$ (moles per unit biomass), synthesis flux $v_{i}$ (moles per unit biomass per unit time), and first-order loss rate constant $d_{i} > 0$ (per unit time), steady state satisfies $T_{i} = v_{i}/d_{i}$.\n\nHerbivore pressure is such that maintaining both toxins is beneficial, but the two toxin biosynthetic pathways compete for the shared precursor $P$.

It is a standard problem in quantitative biology that relies on the fundamental principle of mass conservation. It is free of invalidating flaws. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in applying the principle of mass conservation to the precursor molecule $P$ at steady state. The problem states that the precursor is supplied at a constant rate $J$ and consumed entirely by the biosynthetic pathways for toxins $A$ and $B$, with no accumulation or other sinks.\n\nLet $v_{A}$ and $v_{B}$ be the synthesis fluxes for toxins $A$ and $B$, respectively, in units of moles per unit biomass per unit time. The synthesis of one molecule of toxin $A$ requires $s_{A}$ molecules of $P$, and the synthesis of one molecule of toxin $B$ requires $s_{B}$ molecules of $P$. Therefore, the total rate of consumption of the precursor $P$ is the sum of the consumption rates for each pathway. The mass balance equation for the precursor $P$ at steady state is thus:\n$$\nJ = s_{A} v_{A} + s_{B} v_{B}\n$$\nThis equation states that the total influx of the precursor, $J$, must equal the total efflux into the two biosynthetic pathways.\n\nNext, we use the second piece of information provided: the steady-state condition for the toxins themselves. The problem states that for toxin $i \\in \\{A, B\\}$, its concentration $T_{i}$ is at a steady state where the synthesis flux $v_{i}$ is balanced by a first-order loss process with rate constant $d_{i}$. This relationship is given as:\n$$\nT_{i} = \\frac{v_{i}}{d_{i}}\n$$\nWe can rearrange this expression to solve for the synthesis flux $v_{i}$ in terms of the toxin concentration $T_{i}$ and the loss rate constant $d_{i}$:\n$$\nv_{i} = d_{i} T_{i}\n$$\nApplying this to both toxins $A$ and $B$, we have:\n$$\nv_{A} = d_{A} T_{A}\n$$\n$$\nv_{B} = d_{B} T_{B}\n$$\nNow, we substitute these expressions for $v_{A}$ and $v_{B}$ back into the precursor mass balance equation:\n$$\nJ = s_{A} (d_{A} T_{A}) + s_{B} (d_{B} T_{B})\n$$\nThis equation represents the fundamental trade-off between the steady-state concentrations of the two toxins, $T_{A}$ and $T_{B}$, dictated by the fixed total resource supply $J$.\n\nThe problem requires the relationship to be expressed in terms of the normalized, dimensionless variables $\\theta_{A}$ and $\\theta_{B}$, which are defined as:\n$$\n\\theta_{A} \\equiv \\frac{s_{A} d_{A} T_{A}}{J}\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_{B} \\equiv \\frac{s_{B} d_{B} T_{B}}{J}\n$$\nThese variables represent the fraction of the total precursor flux $J$ allocated to the synthesis of toxin $A$ and toxin $B$, respectively.\n\nTo transform our trade-off equation into these variables, we can divide the entire equation by the constant total supply flux $J$ (since $J$ is a rate, it is non-zero):\n$$\n\\frac{J}{J} = \\frac{s_{A} d_{A} T_{A}}{J} + \\frac{s_{B} d_{B} T_{B}}{J}\n$$\n$$\n1 = \\frac{s_{A} d_{A} T_{A}}{J} + \\frac{s_{B} d_{B} T_{B}}{J}\n$$\nBy direct substitution of the definitions for $\\theta_{A}$ and $\\theta_{B}$, we obtain the normalized trade-off relationship:\n$$\n1 = \\theta_{A} + \\theta_{B}\n$$\nFinally, the problem asks for an expression for $\\theta_{B}$ as a function of $\\theta_{A}$. A simple algebraic rearrangement of the above equation yields the result:\n$$\n\\theta_{B} = 1 - \\theta_{A}\n$$\nThis is the exact analytical expression for the trade-off between the normalized steady-state toxin levels.

Assume random encounters between plant and herbivore individuals in each generation.\n\nAssume the following fundamental and widely used ingredients of host–enemy selection dynamics:\n- The next-generation genotype frequencies are determined by relative genotype fitness within each species in discrete generations, with genotype fitness equal to expected reproductive success across encounters.\n- The resistance allele $R$ imposes a constitutive cost $c_{R}$ on the plant regardless of encounter outcome, with $0 < c_{R} < 1$. The virulence allele $V$ imposes a constitutive cost $c_{V}$ on the herbivore regardless of encounter outcome, with $0 < c_{V} < 1$.\n- If herbivory succeeds on a plant individual, the plant’s fitness is multiplicatively reduced by a damage factor $s$, with $0 < s < 1$.

It is a well-formulated question in theoretical biology that can be solved using standard mathematical methods.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of Fitnesses and Recurrence Relations**\n\nLet $W_R$ and $W_r$ be the marginal fitnesses of the plant alleles $R$ and $r$, respectively. Let $W_V$ and $W_v$ be the marginal fitnesses of the herbivore alleles $V$ and $v$. The populations are haploid, so genotype fitness is equivalent to allele marginal fitness. We normalize the baseline fitness of both species to $1$.\n\n**Plant Fitness**\nThe fitness of a plant is determined by its genotype and the probability of encountering each herbivore type.\n- **Fitness of allele $R$ ($W_R$)**: A plant with allele $R$ incurs a constitutive cost $c_{R}$, reducing its baseline fitness to $1-c_{R}$. It encounters a virulent herbivore ($V$) with probability $q$, leading to successful herbivory and a further fitness reduction by a factor of $s$. It encounters an avirulent herbivore ($v$) with probability $1-q$, on which herbivory fails, so there is no further fitness reduction. The expected fitness is:\n$$W_{R} = q \\cdot (1-c_{R})(1-s) + (1-q) \\cdot (1-c_{R}) = (1-c_{R}) [q(1-s) + (1-q)] = (1-c_{R})(1-qs)$$\n- **Fitness of allele $r$ ($W_r$)**: A plant with allele $r$ bears no cost of resistance. However, both virulent ($V$) and avirulent ($v$) herbivores are successful against it. Therefore, it always suffers damage $s$ upon an encounter. The expected fitness is:\n$$W_{r} = 1-s$$\nThe average fitness of the plant population is $\\bar{W}_{\\text{plant}} = p W_{R} + (1-p) W_{r}$. The recurrence relation for the frequency of the $R$ allele, $p' = p \\frac{W_R}{\\bar{W}_{\\text{plant}}}$, is:\n$$p^{\\prime} = \\frac{p(1-c_{R})(1-qs)}{p(1-c_{R})(1-qs) + (1-p)(1-s)}$$\n\n**Herbivore Fitness**\nHerbivore fitness is determined by its expected payoff from encounters, reduced by any constitutive costs.\n- **Fitness of allele $V$ ($W_V$)**: A herbivore with allele $V$ is virulent and thus succeeds on both $R$ and $r$ plants. Its expected payoff is $1$. It incurs a constitutive cost $c_{V}$. We model its fitness as the expected payoff minus the cost.\n$$W_{V} = (p \\cdot 1 + (1-p) \\cdot 1) - c_V = 1 - c_{V}$$\n- **Fitness of allele $v$ ($W_v$)**: A herbivore with allele $v$ is avirulent. It fails on $R$ plants (payoff $0$) and succeeds on $r$ plants (payoff $1$). It bears no cost. Its expected fitness is:\n$$W_{v} = p \\cdot 0 + (1-p) \\cdot 1 = 1-p$$\nThe average fitness of the herbivore population is $\\bar{W}_{\\text{herb}} = q W_{V} + (1-q) W_{v}$. The recurrence relation for the frequency of the $V$ allele, $q' = q \\frac{W_V}{\\bar{W}_{\\text{herb}}}$, is:\n$$q^{\\prime} = \\frac{q(1-c_{V})}{q(1-c_{V}) + (1-q)(1-p)}$$\n\n**Task 2: Identification of Interior Polymorphic Equilibria**\n\nAn interior polymorphic equilibrium $(p^{\\ast}, q^{\\ast})$ is a state where $0  p^{\\ast}  1$ and $0  q^{\\ast}  1$, and allele frequencies remain constant over generations ($p' = p$ and $q' = q$).

For $p^{\\ast}$: We require $0  p^{\\ast}  1$, which means $0  c_{V}  1$. This condition is given in the problem statement.\n2.  For $q^{\\ast}$: We require $0  q^{\\ast}  1$.\n    - The denominator $s(1-c_{R})$ is always positive since $0  s  1$ and $0  c_{R}  1$.\n    - The condition $q^{\\ast} > 0$ requires the numerator to be positive: $s - c_{R} > 0$, or $s > c_{R}$. This means the damage from herbivory must exceed the cost of resistance.\n    - The condition $q^{\\ast}  1$ requires $\\frac{s-c_{R}}{s(1-c_{R})}  1$. This implies $s-c_{R}  s(1-c_{R})$, which simplifies to $s-c_{R}  s - s c_{R}$. This further simplifies to $-c_{R}  -s c_{R}$. Since $c_R > 0$, we can divide by $-c_R$ and reverse the inequality, yielding $1 > s$. This condition is also given in the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the sole parameter restriction for the existence of a unique interior polymorphic equilibrium is $s > c_{R}$.\n\nThe interior polymorphic equilibrium is given by the pair $(p^{\\ast}, q^{\\ast})$.\n$$p^{\\ast} = c_{V}$$\n$$q^{\\ast} = \\frac{s-c_{R}}{s(1-c_{R})}$$\nThis point represents a coevolutionary balance where the frequency of resistance in plants is determined by the cost of virulence in herbivores, and the frequency of virulence in herbivores is determined by the trade-off between the cost of resistance and the damage from herbivory in plants.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} c_{V}  \\frac{s - c_{R}}{s(1 - c_{R})} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2554981"}, {"introduction": "Real-world coevolutionary arms races often involve multiple, continuously varying traits that are genetically linked.

Determine the evolutionary response (change in traits) for each species, $\\Delta \\mathbf{z}_{p}^{(t)} = \\mathbf{G}_{p} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{p}^{(t)}$ and $\\Delta \\mathbf{z}_{h}^{(t)} = \\mathbf{G}_{h} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{h}^{(t)}$.\n$4$. Update the mean trait vectors to obtain the state for the next generation: $\\mathbf{z}_{p}^{(t+1)} = \\mathbf{z}_{p}^{(t)} + \\Delta \\mathbf{z}_{p}^{(t)}$ and $\\mathbf{z}_{h}^{(t+1)} = \\mathbf{z}_{h}^{(t)} + \\Delta \\mathbf{z}_{h}^{(t)}$.\n\nThis iterative procedure is executed for the specified number of generations $T$. For the special case where $T=0$, no iterations are performed, and the final state is identical to the initial state, i.e., $\\mathbf{z}_{p}^{(0)}$ and $\\mathbf{z}_{h}^{(0)}$.\n\nThe implementation will process each test case independently. For each case, the given parameters ($\\mathbf{G}_p, \\mathbf{G}_h, \\mathbf{M}, b_p, b_h, s_p, s_h, \\mathbf{z}_{p}^{(0)}, \\mathbf{z}_{h}^{(0)}, T$) are used to initialize and run the simulation. The final vectors $\\mathbf{z}_{p}^{(T)}$ and $\\mathbf{z}_{h}^{(T)}$ are concatenated into a single\n$4$-component vector $[\\mathbf{z}_{p,1}^{(T)}, \\mathbf{z}_{p,2}^{(T)}, \\mathbf{z}_{h,1}^{(T)}, \\mathbf{z}_{h,2}^{(T)}]$, with each component rounded to $6$ decimal places as required. The results from all test cases are then aggregated into a single flat list for the final output. All matrix and vector algebra will be handled using the `numpy` library.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the coevolutionary dynamics problem for the given test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            # Case A: general antagonistic coevolution, moderate covariances\n            \"Gp\": np.array([[0.08, 0.02], [0.02, 0.05]]),\n            \"Gh\": np.array([[0.06, 0.01], [0.01, 0.07]]),\n            \"M\": np.array([[1.0, 0.3], [0.2, 0.9]]),\n            \"bp\": 0.5, \"bh\": 0.5, \"sp\": 0.1, \"sh\": 0.1,\n            \"zp0\": np.array([0.2, 0.1]),\n            \"zh0\": np.array([0.1, 0.3]),\n            \"T\": 50\n        },\n        {\n            # Case B: boundary condition: zero generations\n            \"Gp\": np.array([[0.08, 0.02], [0.02, 0.05]]),\n            \"Gh\": np.array([[0.06, 0.01], [0.01, 0.07]]),\n            \"M\": np.array([[1.0, 0.3], [0.2, 0.9]]),\n            \"bp\": 0.5, \"bh\": 0.5, \"sp\": 0.1, \"sh\": 0.1,\n            \"zp0\": np.array([0.4, -0.2]),\n            \"zh0\": np.array([-0.1, 0.0]),\n            \"T\": 0\n        },\n        {\n            # Case C: nearly singular response in one herbivore trait\n            \"Gp\": np.array([[0.01, 0.0], [0.0, 0.01]]),\n            \"Gh\": np.array([[0.0001, 0.0], [0.0, 0.02]]),\n            \"M\": np.array([[1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0]]),\n            \"bp\": 0.3, \"bh\": 0.6, \"sp\": 0.2, \"sh\": 0.2,\n            \"zp0\": np.array([0.5, 0.5]),\n            \"zh0\": np.array([0.4, 0.1]),\n            \"T\": 100\n        },\n        {\n            # Case D: strong antagonism and strong stabilizing selection\n            \"Gp\": np.array([[0.05, -0.015], [-0.015, 0.04]]),\n            \"Gh\": np.array([[0.07, 0.02], [0.02, 0.05]]),\n            \"M\": np.array([[0.8, 0.2], [0.4, 1.2]]),\n            \"bp\": 1.5, \"bh\": 1.5, \"sp\": 0.8, \"sh\": 0.8,\n            \"zp0\": np.array([-0.2, 0.2]),\n            \"zh0\": np.array([0.0, -0.1]),\n            \"T\": 30\n        }\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        Gp, Gh, M = case[\"Gp\"], case[\"Gh\"], case[\"M\"]\n        bp, bh, sp, sh = case[\"bp\"], case[\"bh\"], case[\"sp\"], case[\"sh\"]\n        zp, zh = case[\"zp0\"], case[\"zh0\"]\n        T = case[\"T\"]\n        \n        # Perform the deterministic simulation for T generations\n        for _ in range(T):\n            # Calculate mismatch\n            m = zh - (M @ zp)\n            \n            # Calculate selection gradients\n            beta_h = bh * m - sh * zh\n            beta_p = -bp * (M.T @ m) - sp * zp\n            \n            # Update trait vectors\n            zp = zp + (Gp @ beta_p)\n            zh = zh + (Gh @ beta_h)\n\n        # Concatenate and flatten the final trait vectors\n        final_vector = np.concatenate((zp, zh))\n        \n        # Round the results to 6 decimal places\n        rounded_vector = np.round(final_vector, 6)\n        \n        all_results.extend(rounded_vector.tolist())\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, all_results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2555040"}]}
