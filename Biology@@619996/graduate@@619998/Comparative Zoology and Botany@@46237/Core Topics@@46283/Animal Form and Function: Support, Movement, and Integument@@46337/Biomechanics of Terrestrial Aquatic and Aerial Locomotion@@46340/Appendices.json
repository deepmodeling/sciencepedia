In the spring–pendulum framework of locomotion, walking is modeled as an inverted pendulum vault of the center of mass (COM) over a relatively stiff leg, whereas running is modeled as a spring–mass bounce with appreciable leg compression. Starting from Newton’s second law and the kinematics of circular motion, derive the natural dimensionless group that compares the inertial demand to the gravitational restoring influence for the COM when the stance leg is approximated as a rigid link of length $L$.

In the inverted-pendulum picture of walking, the stance leg is treated as a rigid link of length $L$ about which the center of mass (COM) vaults during stance. The COM trajectory is approximately circular about the foot contact point near mid-stance. For circular motion of radius $L$ with speed $v$, the COM experiences a centripetal acceleration of magnitude\n$$\na_{c} = \\frac{v^{2}}{L}.\n$$\nNewton’s second law applied to the COM in the radial direction during mid-stance involves the ground reaction force (GRF), which must supply the centripetal acceleration in addition to balancing weight so that the foot does not detach and the leg does not go slack. A natural non-dimensionalization compares the inertial term $a_{c}$ to the gravitational acceleration $g$:\n$$\nFr \\equiv \\frac{a_{c}}{g} = \\frac{v^{2}}{g L}.\n$$\nThis is the Froude number (Fr), a dimensionless parameter widely used in comparative biomechanics to express dynamic similarity across size scales.\n\nWhy does $Fr$ control the breakdown of the inverted-pendulum mechanism? In an ideal inverted pendulum with a stiff leg and no aerial phase, the COM must be supported throughout stance with a ground reaction force that remains non-negative. At the apex of the vault (mid-stance), the radial force requirement is set by $m a_{c} = m v^{2}/L$. The weight $m g$ acts downward (away from the pivot in the inverted geometry), and the leg must provide sufficient compressive or tensile force to keep the COM on the curved path. If $v^{2}/L$ becomes large relative to $g$, the configuration approaches a limit where the required centripetal acceleration cannot be provided by a purely vaulting, stiff-leg mechanism without introducing significant leg compression and elastic storage. In other words, as $Fr$ increases, the inverted-pendulum energy exchange becomes less feasible and less economical, and the spring–mass bouncing solution (running) emerges as dynamically appropriate.\n\nIn comparative biped data, the empirically supported transition between dynamically appropriate walking and running occurs near\n$$\nFr_{c} = 0.5.\n$$\nWe will therefore use this threshold as a criterion: if $Fr  Fr_{c}$, walking is dynamically appropriate; if $Fr \\ge Fr_{c}$, running is dynamically appropriate.\n\nNow compute $Fr$ for the given organism:\n- Given $L = 0.95 \\ \\mathrm{m}$ and $v = 2.30 \\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$, with $g = 9.81 \\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$,\n$$\nFr = \\frac{v^{2}}{g L} = \\frac{(2.30)^{2}}{(9.81)(0.95)} = \\frac{5.29}{9.3195}.\n$$\nEvaluate the ratio symbolically as the quotient above and then numerically:\n$$\nFr \\approx 0.5674\\ldots\n$$\nNow apply the threshold $Fr_{c} = 0.5$.

The derivation must begin from fundamental principles and employ a first-order approximation for the compressibility of the fish's tissues and the surrounding seawater.\n\nThe condition for neutral buoyancy is that the net force on the object is zero. This occurs when the gravitational force, $F_g$, is exactly balanced by the buoyant force, $F_B$. According to Newton's second law for static equilibrium, we have $F_g - F_B = 0$, which implies $F_g = F_B$.\n\nThe gravitational force on the fish is given by $F_g = m g$, where $m$ is the total mass of the fish and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nThe buoyant force is described by Archimedes' principle, which states that the upward buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. At a depth $z$, this is $F_B = \\rho_{sw}(z) V_{total}(z) g$, where $\\rho_{sw}(z)$ is the density of seawater at that depth and $V_{total}(z)$ is the total volume of the fish at that depth.\n\nThe total volume of the fish is the sum of the volume of its tissues, $V_t(z)$, and the volume of the gas in its swim bladder, $V_g(z)$. We are instructed to neglect the mass of the gas.\n$$V_{total}(z) = V_t(z) + V_g(z)$$\nThe neutral buoyancy condition $F_g = F_B$ thus becomes:\n$$mg = \\rho_{sw}(z) (V_t(z) + V_g(z))g$$\nCanceling $g$ from both sides, we obtain the mass-balance equation for neutral buoyancy:\n$$m = \\rho_{sw}(z) (V_t(z) + V_g(z))$$\n\nNext, we must account for the change in density of both the fish's tissues and the seawater due to the increased pressure at depth $z$. The pressure change, $\\Delta P$, relative to the surface pressure $P_0$ is given by the hydrostatic pressure approximation:\n$$\\Delta P = P(z) - P_0 \\approx \\rho_{sw,0} g z$$\nThe bulk modulus, $K$, relates the change in pressure to the fractional change in volume: $K = -V \\frac{dP}{dV}$. For a finite pressure change $\\Delta P$, this can be approximated as $\\Delta V \\approx -V_0 \\frac{\\Delta P}{K}$.

The density at increased pressure is $\\rho = \\frac{M}{V_0(1 - \\Delta P/K)} = \\frac{\\rho_0}{1 - \\Delta P/K}$.\nThe problem specifies a first-order, small-compressibility approximation. For small $\\frac{\\Delta P}{K}$, we can use the Taylor expansion $(1-x)^{-1} \\approx 1+x$.
