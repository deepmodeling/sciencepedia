The volume $V$ of a right circular cylinder with radius $r$ and length $L$ is given by the formula:\n$$V = \\pi r^{2} L$$\n\nLet $V_{0}$ be the initial volume of the segment at rest. With initial radius $r_{0}$ and initial length $L_{0}$, this volume is:\n$$V_{0} = \\pi r_{0}^{2} L_{0}$$\n\nAfter the deformation, the segment has a new radius, $r_{f}$, and a new length, $L_{f}$.

We can isolate the term $(L_{0} + \\Delta L)$ by dividing by $(r_{0} + \\Delta r)^{2}$:\n$$L_{0} + \\Delta L = \\frac{r_{0}^{2} L_{0}}{(r_{0} + \\Delta r)^{2}}$$\n\nNow, we solve for $\\Delta L$ by subtracting $L_{0}$ from both sides:\n$$\\Delta L = \\frac{r_{0}^{2} L_{0}}{(r_{0} + \\Delta r)^{2}} - L_{0}$$\n\nTo obtain a single, more compact expression, we can factor out $L_{0}$:\n$$\\Delta L = L_{0} \\left( \\frac{r_{0}^{2}}{(r_{0} + \\Delta r)^{2}} - 1 \\right)$$\n\nWe can combine the terms inside the parentheses by using a common denominator:\n$$\\Delta L = L_{0} \\left( \\frac{r_{0}^{2} - (r_{0} + \\Delta r)^{2}}{(r_{0} + \\Delta r)^{2}} \\right)$$\n\nNext, we expand the squared term in the numerator, $(r_{0} + \\Delta r)^{2} = r_{0}^{2} + 2 r_{0} \\Delta r + (\\Delta r)^{2}$:\n$$\\Delta L = L_{0} \\left( \\frac{r_{0}^{2} - (r_{0}^{2} + 2 r_{0} \\Delta r + (\\Delta r)^{2})}{(r_{0} + \\Delta r)^{2}} \\right)$$\n\nSimplifying the numerator by distributing the negative sign gives:\n$$\\Delta L = L_{0} \\left( \\frac{r_{0}^{2} - r_{0}^{2} - 2 r_{0} \\Delta r - (\\Delta r)^{2}}{(r_{0} + \\Delta r)^{2}} \\right)$$\n$$\\Delta L = L_{0} \\left( \\frac{-2 r_{0} \\Delta r - (\\Delta r)^{2}}{(r_{0} + \\Delta r)^{2}} \\right)$$\n\nFinally, we can factor out $-\\Delta r$ from the numerator to arrive at the final closed-form expression:\n$$\\Delta L = -L_{0} \\frac{\\Delta r (2 r_{0} + \\Delta r)}{(r_{0} + \\Delta r)^{2}}$$\n\nThis expression provides the exact change in length $\\Delta L$ as a function of the initial dimensions $r_{0}$ and $L_{0}$, and the measured change in radius $\\Delta r$, under the given assumptions.

The physical model, while a simplification of a biological structure, is a standard and valid approach in biomechanical analysis. The given parameters are dimensionally consistent and physically plausible. The problem is free of scientific unsoundness, ambiguity, or contradiction.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe analysis begins with the determination of the axial force within the cylinder wall induced by the internal pressure. For a cylinder with sealed end caps, the internal pressure $p$ exerts a force $F_p$ on each cap, which has an area of $\\pi r^2$. This force is balanced by a tensile stress in the cylinder wall.\n$$ F_p = p (\\pi r^2) $$\nThis force must be resisted by the tension in the wall, meaning there is a pre-existing tensile force, $T_p$, in the axial direction of the cylinder wall equal to $F_p$.\n$$ T_p = p \\pi r^2 $$\nWhen an external compressive load, which we shall denote $P_{ext}$, is applied to the ends of the cylinder, the net compressive force, $P_{net}$, experienced by the wall is the difference between the external load and the internal tension.\n$$ P_{net} = P_{ext} - T_p = P_{ext} - p \\pi r^2 $$\nBuckling will occur when $P_{ext}$ is large enough to make $P_{net}$ reach a critical positive (compressive) value.\n\nThe problem specifies using the potential energy method. The total potential energy, $\\Pi$, of a beam subjected to a net axial compressive load $P_{net}$ is the sum of the bending strain energy, $U_b$, and the potential of the axial load, $W$.\n$$ \\Pi = U_b + W $$\nFor an Euler-Bernoulli beam with small transverse deflection $v(x)$, these energy components are given by:\n$$ U_b = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^L EI \\left( \\frac{d^2v}{dx^2} \\right)^2 dx $$\n$$ W = -\\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^L P_{net} \\left( \\frac{dv}{dx} \\right)^2 dx $$\nThus, the total potential energy is:\n$$ \\Pi[v(x)] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^L \\left[ EI \\left( \\frac{d^2v}{dx^2} \\right)^2 - P_{net} \\left( \\frac{dv}{dx} \\right)^2 \\right] dx $$\nThe critical condition for buckling is found when the straight configuration ($v(x)=0$) becomes unstable. This corresponds to finding the lowest load $P_{net}$ for which a non-trivial deflected shape can exist in equilibrium. According to the principle of stationary potential energy, the first variation of $\\Pi$ must be zero, $\\delta\\Pi = 0$. This leads to the Euler-Lagrange equation for the functional $\\Pi[v(x)]$:\n$$ EI \\frac{d^4v}{dx^4} + P_{net} \\frac{d^2v}{dx^2} = 0 $$\nThe problem specifies pinned-end boundary conditions, which translate to zero displacement and zero bending moment at both ends ($x=0$ and $x=L$).\n$$ v(0) = 0, \\quad v''(0) = 0 $$\n$$ v(L) = 0, \\quad v''(L) = 0 $$\nThe general solution to the differential equation is $v(x) = C_1 \\sin(kx) + C_2 \\cos(kx) + C_3 x + C_4$, where $k = \\sqrt{P_{net}/(EI)}$.\nApplying the boundary conditions at $x=0$:\n$v(0) = C_2 + C_4 = 0$\n$v''(0) = -k^2 C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2=0$, which in turn implies $C_4=0$.\nThe solution simplifies to $v(x) = C_1 \\sin(kx) + C_3 x$.\nApplying the boundary conditions at $x=L$:\n$v(L) = C_1 \\sin(kL) + C_3 L = 0$\n$v''(L) = -k^2 C_1 \\sin(kL) = 0$\nFor a non-trivial buckling mode, $C_1$ cannot be zero. Thus, the last equation requires $\\sin(kL) = 0$. This implies $kL = n\\pi$ for any integer $n \\ge 1$. Since $\\sin(kL)=0$, the condition $C_1 \\sin(kL) + C_3 L = 0$ simplifies to $C_3 L = 0$, meaning $C_3=0$.\nThe lowest critical load corresponds to the first buckling mode, $n=1$, for which $kL = \\pi$.\nSubstituting $k = \\sqrt{P_{net}/(EI)}$:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\frac{P_{net}}{EI}} L = \\pi \\implies (P_{net})_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 EI}{L^2} $$\nThis is the critical net compressive force required in the wall to cause buckling. The external load required, $P_{\\mathrm{cr}}^{\\mathrm{pressurized}}$, is therefore:\n$$ (P_{net})_{cr} = P_{\\mathrm{cr}}^{\\mathrm{pressurized}} - p \\pi r^2 $$\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{cr}}^{\\mathrm{pressurized}} = \\frac{\\pi^2 EI}{L^2} + p \\pi r^2 $$\nFor the unpressurized case ($p=0$), the system is a standard elastic rod. The critical buckling load is the classical Euler load for pinned ends:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{cr}}^{\\mathrm{unpressurized}} = \\frac{\\pi^2 EI}{L^2} $$\nThe internal pressure increases the buckling load by an amount $p \\pi r^2$ corresponding to the axial tension it generates.\n\nThe ratio $\\mathcal{R}$ is defined as:\n$$ \\mathcal{R} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{cr}}^{\\mathrm{pressurized}}}{P_{\\mathrm{cr}}^{\\mathrm{unpressurized}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi^2 EI}{L^2} + p \\pi r^2}{\\frac{\\pi^2 EI}{L^2}} = 1 + \\frac{p \\pi r^2}{\\frac{\\pi^2 EI}{L^2}} = 1 + \\frac{p r^2 L^2}{\\pi E I} $$\nSubstituting the given expression for the second moment of area, $I = \\pi r^3 t$:\n$$ \\mathcal{R} = 1 + \\frac{p r^2 L^2}{\\pi E (\\pi r^3 t)} = 1 + \\frac{p L^2}{\\pi^2 E r t} $$\nNow, the numerical value is computed.

We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution requires completing three tasks.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of Work per Cycle**\nThe first law of thermodynamics for a closed system states that the change in internal energy $dU$ is equal to the heat added to the system $\\delta Q$ minus the work done by the system $\\delta W$: $dU = \\delta Q - \\delta W$. The problem specifies that for a complete cycle, the net change in internal energy is zero, $\\Delta U_{cycle} = \\oint dU = 0$. The mechanical work done *by* the system on its surroundings due to a change in volume is defined by $\\delta W = P dV$. The total work per cycle, $W_{cycle}$, is therefore the path integral of pressure with respect to volume over one full cycle:\n$$\nW_{cycle} = \\oint P dV\n$$\nGiven that pressure and volume are functions of time, we can evaluate this integral over one period $T = 1/f$. Let $\\omega = 2\\pi f$.\n$$\nW_{cycle} = \\int_{0}^{T} P(t) \\frac{dV}{dt} dt\n$$\nThe given functions are $P(t) = P_{0} + \\Delta P \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$ and $V(t) = V_{0} + \\Delta V \\sin(\\omega t)$.

The first term, involving the mean pressure $P_0$, integrates to zero over a full cycle:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} P_{0} \\cos(\\omega t) dt = P_{0} \\left[ \\frac{\\sin(\\omega t)}{\\omega} \\right]_{0}^{T} = \\frac{P_{0}}{\\omega} (\\sin(2\\pi) - \\sin(0)) = 0\n$$\nThus, the net work is determined solely by the oscillatory components of pressure and volume:\n$$\nW_{cycle} = \\omega \\Delta V \\Delta P \\int_{0}^{T} \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi) \\cos(\\omega t) dt\n$$\nWe use the trigonometric sum-of-angles identity $\\sin(A+B) = \\sin A \\cos B + \\cos A \\sin B$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi) \\cos(\\omega t) dt = \\int_{0}^{T} \\left( \\sin(\\omega t)\\cos(\\phi) + \\cos(\\omega t)\\sin(\\phi) \\right) \\cos(\\omega t) dt\n$$\n$$\n= \\cos(\\phi) \\int_{0}^{T} \\sin(\\omega t)\\cos(\\omega t) dt + \\sin(\\phi) \\int_{0}^{T} \\cos^{2}(\\omega t) dt\n$$\nThe integral of $\\sin(\\omega t)\\cos(\\omega t)$ over one period is zero.
