It is a valid problem in physical biochemistry. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nLet $f_{deprot}$ be the fraction of all $\\text{D}$-galacturonic acid (GalA) residues that are deprotonated. The total population of GalA residues is composed of two subpopulations: a fraction $DM$ that is methylesterified and a fraction $1 - DM$ that is not. The methylesterified residues are chemically inert with respect to protonation-deprotonation and carry no charge.

The problem requires the fraction of *all* GalA residues that are charged. This total fraction, $f_{deprot}$, is found by multiplying $\\alpha$ by the fraction of residues that are titratable, which is $1 - DM$.\n$$ f_{deprot}(DM, \\mathrm{pH}, \\mathrm{p}K_{a}) = (1 - DM) \\times \\alpha = (1 - DM) \\frac{10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a}}}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_{a}}} $$\nThis is the general expression required.\n\nNow, we evaluate this function for the given parameters: $DM = 0.60$ and $\\mathrm{p}K_{a} = 3.5$.\nThe fraction of non-esterified residues is $1 - DM = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$.\n\nCase 1: $\\mathrm{pH} = 5$.\nThe fraction of deprotonated titratable groups, $\\alpha_5$, is:\n$$ \\alpha_5 = \\frac{10^{5 - 3.5}}{1 + 10^{5 - 3.5}} = \\frac{10^{1.5}}{1 + 10^{1.5}} \\approx \\frac{31.6228}{1 + 31.6228} \\approx 0.969343 $$\nThe total fraction of charged residues, $f_5$, is:\n$$ f_{5} = (0.40) \\times \\alpha_5 \\approx 0.40 \\times 0.969343 \\approx 0.387737 $$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, $f_5 = 0.3877$.\n\nCase 2: $\\mathrm{pH} = 7$.\nThe fraction of deprotonated titratable groups, $\\alpha_7$, is:\n$$ \\alpha_7 = \\frac{10^{7 - 3.5}}{1 + 10^{7 - 3.5}} = \\frac{10^{3.5}}{1 + 10^{3.5}} \\approx \\frac{3162.28}{1 + 3162.28} \\approx 0.999684 $$\nThe total fraction of charged residues, $f_7$, is:\n$$ f_{7} = (0.40) \\times \\alpha_7 \\approx 0.40 \\times 0.999684 \\approx 0.399874 $$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, $f_7 = 0.3999$.\n\nThe final result is presented as the row matrix $\\big(f_{5}\\ f_{7}\\big)$.\n\nInterpretation: The fraction of negatively charged residues increases from $0.3877$ at $\\mathrm{pH} = 5$ to $0.3999$ at $\\mathrm{pH} = 7$. Since the $\\mathrm{pH}$ in both cases is well above the $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ of $3.5$, the vast majority of available carboxyl groups are already deprotonated. The increase in $\\mathrm{pH}$ from $5$ to $7$ pushes the equilibrium even further toward deprotonation, saturating the available sites and causing the overall negative charge of the polymer to approach its maximum possible value, which is $1 - DM = 0.40$. This increase in negative charge density, while small, enhances electrostatic repulsion between polymer chains, which can lead to swelling of the pectic matrix. Furthermore, the change in the electrostatic potential of the pectin substrate can modulate its interaction with enzymes like pectin methylesterase (PME), potentially affecting enzyme binding affinity and catalytic activity.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0.3877 & 0.3999 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2560489"}, {"introduction": "Having examined the properties of the individual cellulose and pectin components, we can now model the entire primary cell wall as a fiber-reinforced composite material.
