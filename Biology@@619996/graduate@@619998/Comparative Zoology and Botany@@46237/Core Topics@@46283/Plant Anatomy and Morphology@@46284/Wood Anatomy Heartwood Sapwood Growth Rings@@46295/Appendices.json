A subsample is prepared by isolating a homogeneous segment from the strip and drying it to constant mass under standard oven-dry conditions, yielding an oven-dry mass denoted by $m_{0}$. By definition, oven-dry mass $m_{0}$ includes the total mass of structural polymers (cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignin) and low-molecular-mass extractives (e.g., phenolics, terpenoids, lipids), but excludes free and bound water.

It is scientifically grounded in standard principles of wood chemistry and anatomy. The terminology ($m_{0}$, $m_{e}$, Soxhlet extraction, heartwood, sapwood) is correctly used according to the conventions of the field. The problem is well-posed; it provides sufficient, non-contradictory information for the derivation and calculation. The numerical values are physically realistic. The qualitative part requests a discussion based on established biological mechanisms, not speculation. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be formulated.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Extractives Mass Fraction**\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the principle of conservation of mass and the operational definitions provided. The total oven-dry mass of the sample before extraction is $m_{0}$. By definition, this mass is the sum of the mass of the extractive-free wood components, which we denote as $m_{\\text{efw}}$, and the mass of the extractives, which is given as $m_{e}$.\n\n$$m_{0} = m_{\\text{efw}} + m_{e}$$\n\nThe mass fraction of any component in a mixture is defined as the mass of that component divided by the total mass of the mixture. In this context, the component of interest is the extractives, and the total system is the initial oven-dry wood sample.\n\nLet $f_{e}$ be the extractives mass fraction. By definition:\n$$f_{e} = \\frac{\\text{mass of extractives}}{\\text{total oven-dry mass}}$$\n\nSubstituting the symbols provided in the problem statement:\n$$f_{e} = \\frac{m_{e}}{m_{0}}$$\n\nThis expression provides the extractives mass fraction as a function of the experimentally determined quantities $m_{0}$ and $m_{e}$. Note that the basis for this fraction is the initial total oven-dry mass, which is the standard convention for expressing mass fraction unless another basis (such as extractive-free mass, $\\frac{m_{e}}{m_{\\text{efw}}} = \\frac{m_{e}}{m_{0}-m_{e}}$) is explicitly specified. The problem asks for the \"extractives mass fraction\" without such specification, implying the fraction relative to the total mass.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nThe problem requires the evaluation of this expression for the specific case where $m_{0} = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{g}$ and $m_{e} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{g}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$f_{e} = \\frac{0.8}{10.0} = 0.08$$\n\nThe problem statement explicitly demands that the final numerical answer be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $0.08$. To express this with four significant figures, we append trailing zeros after the last non-zero digit.\n\n$$f_{e} = 0.0800$$\n\nThis is the required numerical answer, reported as a unitless decimal fraction.\n\n**Part 3: Qualitative Discussion on Anatomical Variation of Extractives**\n\nThe extractives mass fraction is not a constant property but varies systematically with tissue type and anatomical structure.\n\n**Heartwood vs. Sapwood:**\nThe fundamental difference between sapwood and heartwood drives the primary variation in extractives content. Sapwood is the outer, physiologically active xylem, responsible for water transport from roots to leaves and for the storage of non-structural carbohydrates. It contains living cells, primarily axial and ray parenchyma. The concentration of secondary metabolites, i.e., extractives, in sapwood is generally low.\n\nHeartwood is the inner, non-living core of the stem. It is formed from sapwood through a programmed senescence process known as heartwood formation or duraminization. A critical event in this transition is the final metabolic activity of the parenchyma cells before their death. These cells synthesize and deposit large quantities of low-molecular-weight organic compounds—the extractives—into the lumens and cell walls of the surrounding xylem elements (vessels, tracheids, fibers). These compounds, often phenolics (e.g., tannins) and terpenoids (e.g., resins), serve a passive protective function, rendering the heartwood resistant to decay fungi and insect attack. Consequently, the extractives mass fraction of heartwood is, by its very nature and function, significantly higher than that of the adjacent sapwood.\n\n**Modulation by Growth Ring Structure:**\nThe anatomical arrangement of cells within a growth ring, specifically the distribution of vessels and parenchyma, modulates how and where extractives are deposited during heartwood formation.\n\n1.  **Ring-Porous Angiosperms (e.g., *Quercus* - oak, *Fraxinus* - ash):** These species produce very large-diameter vessels in the earlywood for efficient water conduction at the start of the growing season, and much smaller vessels in the latewood. Axial parenchyma is often arranged in close association with the large earlywood vessels (vasicentric parenchyma). During heartwood formation, these parenchyma cells are the primary agents of change. They not only synthesize and secrete extractives but also frequently produce tyloses—balloon-like intrusions that grow through pits into the vessel lumens, effectively plugging them. Because both the largest conduits and the associated secretory cells are concentrated in the earlywood zone of each ring, extractive deposition and vessel occlusion are most pronounced there. This leads to a high concentration of extractives localized within the earlywood portion of each heartwood growth ring.\n\n2.  **Diffuse-Porous Angiosperms (e.g., *Acer* - maple, *Betula* - birch):** In these woods, the vessels are of a more uniform, smaller diameter and are distributed more evenly throughout the earlywood and latewood. Parenchyma cells can also be more diffusely scattered or arranged in patterns (e.g., tangential bands) that are not strictly tied to the earlywood/latewood boundary. As a result, during heartwood formation, the deposition of extractives is more uniform across the width of the growth ring compared to the highly localized deposition in ring-porous species. The modulation by the ring structure itself is therefore less dramatic.\n\n3.  **Gymnosperms (e.g., *Pinus* - pine, *Picea* - spruce):** These species lack vessels and rely on smaller-diameter tracheids for water conduction. A key feature for many gymnosperms, particularly in the pine family, is the presence of resin canals. These are tubular structures surrounded by a layer of specialized secretory parenchyma cells (epithelial cells) that synthesize resin, a major class of extractives. During heartwood formation, the living parenchyma cells associated with resin canals and those scattered axially (axial parenchyma) deposit additional phenolic compounds and other substances into the lumens of adjacent tracheids, while the resin canals themselves become engorged with resin. The distribution of resin canals, which can be more frequent in the latewood of some species, dictates a corresponding pattern of high extractive concentration. The mechanism is distinct from angiosperms due to the absence of vessels and the specialized resin canal system, but the principle remains: the location of living parenchyma at the time of heartwood formation determines the sites of extractive deposition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0800}$$", "id": "2622055"}, {"introduction": "While sapwood is defined by its capacity for water transport, not all parts of it contribute equally. This exercise applies the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, a fundamental principle of fluid dynamics, to reveal how dramatically hydraulic efficiency is governed by conduit anatomy [@problem_id:2622017].

Earlywood vessels are typically larger in diameter than latewood vessels within the same growth ring, while heartwood is functionally non-conductive due to tyloses and extractives.

The premises are scientifically sound, the definitions are clear, and the given values are physically realistic for an idealized system. The problem is well-posed and valid. We will proceed with its solution from first principles.\n\nThe governing principle for this problem is the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, which describes the steady, laminar flow of an incompressible, Newtonian fluid through a long, cylindrical pipe. The equation for the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, is:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}$$\nHere, $r$ is the internal radius of the pipe, $\\Delta P$ is the pressure difference across the pipe of length $L$, and $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nThe problem provides vessel diameters, not radii. The relationship between diameter $d$ and radius $r$ is $r = \\frac{d}{2}$. We must substitute this into the Hagen-Poiseuille equation to express the flow rate in terms of diameter:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L} = \\frac{\\pi d^4 \\Delta P}{16 \\cdot 8 \\mu L} = \\frac{\\pi d^4 \\Delta P}{128 \\mu L}$$\nThis is the correct form of the equation for our purposes.\n\nThe problem defines the single-vessel axial hydraulic conductance, $G$, as $G = \\frac{Q}{\\Delta P}$.

It establishes that for a given fluid viscosity $\\mu$ and vessel length $L$, the hydraulic conductance $G$ is directly proportional to the fourth power of the vessel diameter, $d$. This is a cornerstone result in plant ecophysiology, frequently referred to as Poiseuille's law in this context.\n\nNext, we must compute the ratio of the conductance of the earlywood vessel, $G_{1}$, to that of the latewood vessel, $G_{2}$. The earlywood vessel has a diameter $d_{1} = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, and the latewood vessel has a diameter $d_{2} = 30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. It is stated that both vessels have the same length $L$, conduct the same fluid with viscosity $\\mu$, and are subjected to the same pressure difference $\\Delta P$.\n\nUsing the derived formula for conductance, we write the expressions for $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$:\n$$G_{1} = \\frac{\\pi d_{1}^4}{128 \\mu L}$$\n$$G_{2} = \\frac{\\pi d_{2}^4}{128 \\mu L}$$\nThe ratio $\\frac{G_{1}}{G_{2}}$ is then found by division:\n$$\\frac{G_{1}}{G_{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi d_{1}^4}{128 \\mu L}}{\\frac{\\pi d_{2}^4}{128 \\mu L}} = \\frac{d_{1}^4}{d_{2}^4} = \\left(\\frac{d_{1}}{d_{2}}\\right)^4$$\nAll physical parameters other than the diameters cancel out, leaving a dimensionless ratio dependent only on the geometry of the vessels.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values for the diameters:\n$$\\frac{G_{1}}{G_{2}} = \\left(\\frac{100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}\\right)^4 = \\left(\\frac{10}{3}\\right)^4$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\\left(\\frac{10}{3}\\right)^4 = \\frac{10^4}{3^4} = \\frac{10000}{81}$$\nThis is the exact, dimensionless numerical answer required. The significant implication of this result is the disproportionately large contribution of wider vessels to overall hydraulic conductivity.

Consider two angiosperm taxa: a ring-porous species in which earlywood vessels within a growth ring are large, and a diffuse-porous species in which vessels are more uniform and smaller. Suppose you wish to compare the relative freeze–thaw embolism susceptibility of sapwood conduits between these taxa using vessel diameter as a proxy. Start from the following fundamentals and assumptions that are widely supported in the literature on xylem hydraulics and wood anatomy:\n- The Laplace relation for a gas–liquid interface gives a pressure difference across a spherical bubble of radius $r_{b}$ as $\\Delta P = 2\\gamma/r_{b}$, where $\\gamma$ is the liquid–gas surface tension.\n- During thaw, a bubble can expand and embolize a conduit if the thawing pressure swing in the sap column, denoted $\\Delta P_{\\mathrm{thaw}}$, satisfies $\\Delta P_{\\mathrm{thaw}} \\ge 2\\gamma/r_{b}$.

The anatomical distinction between ring-porous and diffuse-porous wood is a fundamental concept in botany. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient assumptions to construct a mathematical model and derive the required scaling relationship. All terms are defined, and the given data are physically realistic. The problem is objective and free of non-formalizable content. The reference to the asymptotic regime $r \\gg r_c$ is a standard simplification in physical modeling and does not render the problem invalid. The problem is self-contained and consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe task is to derive the scaling of the susceptibility index $S(d)$ with vessel diameter $d$ and compute the ratio of this index for two different diameters. The index $S(d)$ is defined as being proportional to the expected number of embolism-initiating bubbles per unit conduit length. Let us denote this expected number per unit length as $N_{b}(d)$.\n$$\nS(d) \\propto N_{b}(d)\n$$\nThe value of $N_{b}(d)$ is the product of two quantities: the number of potential nucleation sites per unit length of the vessel, which we will call $n_{\\text{sites}}(d)$, and the probability that any given site will successfully nucleate a bubble that leads to embolism, which we will call $P_{\\text{nuc}}$.\n$$\nN_{b}(d) = n_{\\text{sites}}(d) \\cdot P_{\\text{nuc}}\n$$\nFirst, we determine the dependence of $n_{\\text{sites}}(d)$ on the vessel diameter $d$. The problem states that the density of potential nucleation sites per unit inner wall area is constant. Let this density be $\\sigma$. A cylindrical vessel of diameter $d$ and length $L$ has an inner surface area $A = \\pi d L$. The total number of sites in this vessel segment is $\\sigma A = \\sigma \\pi d L$. The number of sites per unit length is therefore:\n$$\nn_{\\text{sites}}(d) = \\frac{\\sigma \\pi d L}{L} = \\sigma \\pi d\n$$\nThus, the number of potential nucleation sites per unit length is directly proportional to the vessel diameter $d$.\n\nNext, we consider the probability of nucleation, $P_{\\text{nuc}}$. The problem provides a critical simplifying assumption for the regime where the vessel radius $r = d/2$ is much larger than the critical nucleus radius $r_c$. It states that \"the fraction of sites that can host supercritical nuclei approaches a constant that does not depend on $r$ to leading order\". This fraction is precisely the probability $P_{\\text{nuc}}$. Therefore, under the specified conditions, $P_{\\text{nuc}}$ is a constant, independent of the vessel diameter $d$. Let us denote this constant probability as $C$.\n$$\nP_{\\text{nuc}} = C\n$$\nNow, we can express the expected number of embolism-initiating bubbles per unit length as a function of $d$:\n$$\nN_{b}(d) = n_{\\text{sites}}(d) \\cdot P_{\\text{nuc}} = (\\sigma \\pi d) \\cdot C = (\\sigma \\pi C) d\n$$\nSince $\\sigma$, $\\pi$, and $C$ are all constants, their product is also a constant. Let $K = \\sigma \\pi C$. Then, we have:\n$$\nN_{b}(d) = K d\n$$\nThe susceptibility index $S(d)$ is proportional to $N_{b}(d)$, which means $S(d)$ is also directly proportional to the vessel diameter $d$.\n$$\nS(d) \\propto d\n$$\nThis establishes the scaling relationship. Now, we compute the required ratio using the given diameters.\nLet $d_{\\mathrm{ring}} = 150\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $d_{\\mathrm{diff}} = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nSince $S(d)$ is proportional to $d$, we can write $S(d) = k'd$ for some constant of proportionality $k'$. The ratio of susceptibilities is:\n$$\n\\frac{S(d_{\\mathrm{ring}})}{S(d_{\\mathrm{diff}})} = \\frac{k' d_{\\mathrm{ring}}}{k' d_{\\mathrm{diff}}} = \\frac{d_{\\mathrm{ring}}}{d_{\\mathrm{diff}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values for the diameters:\n$$\n\\frac{S(d_{\\mathrm{ring}})}{S(d_{\\mathrm{diff}})} = \\frac{150\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = 3\n$$\nThe ratio is a dimensionless number.
