The premise is based on the Hagen–Poiseuille equation for laminar flow, a fundamental principle of fluid dynamics, which is widely applied to model water transport in plant xylem. The biological context—seasonal variation in vessel size in temperate angiosperms—is factually correct. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and assumptions to derive the requested quantity. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the provided first principles.\nThe hydraulic conductance of a single cylindrical conduit, $k_h$, is given to be proportional to the fourth power of its radius, $r$. We can write this relationship as:\n$$\nk_h = \\alpha r^4\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a constant of proportionality. This constant incorporates factors such as the dynamic viscosity of the fluid ($\\eta$) and geometric factors. Specifically, from the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, the volumetric flow rate $Q$ for a pressure gradient $\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}$ is $Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4}{8\\eta} \\frac{\\Delta P}{L}$. Since conductance is defined as $k_h = Q / (\\frac{\\Delta P}{L})$, we have $k_h = \\frac{\\pi r^4}{8\\eta}$. Thus, $\\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{8\\eta}$. The problem states that dynamic viscosity is unchanged between bands, so $\\alpha$ is indeed a constant for our purposes.\n\nNext, the macroscopic axial hydraulic conductivity, $K$, is stated to be proportional to the sum of single-conduit conductances per unit cross-sectional area. Let us consider a cross-sectional area $A$. The number of vessels within this area is $N = nA$, where $n$ is the number of vessels per unit area.\n\nThe sum of single-conduit conductances over the area $A$ is $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (k_h)_i$. According to the problem's assumption, all vessels within a given band (earlywood or latewood) have the same mean radius. Let this radius be $r_j$ for a generic band $j$. Therefore, the conductance for each vessel in this band is $k_h(r_j) = \\alpha r_j^4$. The sum of conductances is then:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (k_h)_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{nA} \\alpha r_j^4 = (nA) (\\alpha r_j^4)\n$$\nThe hydraulic conductivity $K_j$ for band $j$ is proportional to this sum per unit area:\n$$\nK_j \\propto \\frac{(nA) (\\alpha r_j^4)}{A}\n$$\nThe area $A$ cancels, yielding:\n$$\nK_j \\propto n \\alpha r_j^4\n$$\nLet us introduce a second constant of proportionality, $\\beta$, such that:\n$$\nK_j = \\beta n \\alpha r_j^4\n$$\nWe can combine the constants into a single constant, $\\gamma = \\beta \\alpha$. Thus, the hydraulic conductivity for a band with mean vessel radius $r_j$ and vessel density $n$ is:\n$$\nK_j = \\gamma n r_j^4\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the vessel density $n$ is constant between the earlywood and latewood bands. The constant $\\gamma$ is also identical for both bands as it depends on physical properties (like viscosity) and proportionality factors that are assumed to be unchanged.\n\nNow we apply this general formula to the two specific bands.\nFor the earlywood band, the mean vessel radius is $r_1$. The hydraulic conductivity is:\n$$\nK_{\\text{early}} = \\gamma n r_1^4\n$$\nFor the latewood band, the mean vessel radius is $r_2$. The hydraulic conductivity is:\n$$\nK_{\\text{late}} = \\gamma n r_2^4\n$$\nThe problem asks for the fold-change $C$, defined as the ratio of latewood to earlywood conductivity:\n$$\nC \\equiv \\frac{K_{\\text{late}}}{K_{\\text{early}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $K_{\\text{late}}$ and $K_{\\text{early}}$:\n$$\nC = \\frac{\\gamma n r_2^4}{\\gamma n r_1^4}\n$$\nThe constants $\\gamma$ and $n$ cancel, as they are identical for both bands. This leaves the final expression:\n$$\nC = \\frac{r_2^4}{r_1^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_2}{r_1}\\right)^4\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression in terms of $r_1$ and $r_2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{r_2}{r_1}\\right)^4}\n$$", "id": "2608684"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the function of secondary xylem, we now turn to the protective tissues produced by the cork cambium.

A rigorous solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation begins from the principles of diffusion. For a one-dimensional, steady-state process, Fick's first law relates the diffusive flux $J$ (amount per unit area per unit time) to the concentration gradient. In this context, it is more convenient to use the pressure gradient. The relationship between flux $J$, permeability $P$, pressure difference $\\Delta p$, and barrier thickness $t$ is:\n$$ J = P \\frac{\\Delta p}{t} $$\nThe units of this expression are $(\\mathrm{mol}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}) \\frac{\\mathrm{Pa}}{\\mathrm{m}} = \\mathrm{mol}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which is correct for flux.\n\nThe thickness of the phellem, $t$, is not constant but increases linearly with time $t$ according to the given function $t(t) = t_0 + rt$. Therefore, the flux is also a function of time:\n$$ J(t) = \\frac{P \\Delta p}{t_0 + rt} $$\nThe total rate of water vapor loss, which we denote as $\\frac{dN}{dt}$ where $N$ is the number of moles of water, is the flux multiplied by the total area $A$:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = A \\cdot J(t) = \\frac{A P \\Delta p}{t_0 + rt} $$\nTo find the cumulative amount of water vapor lost, $N_{total}$, over the time interval $[0, T]$, we must integrate this instantaneous rate with respect to time from $t=0$ to $t=T$:\n$$ N_{total} = \\int_{0}^{T} \\frac{dN}{dt} dt = \\int_{0}^{T} \\frac{A P \\Delta p}{t_0 + rt} dt $$\nThe terms $A$, $P$, and $\\Delta p$ are constants with respect to the integration variable $t$. Thus, they can be factored out of the integral:\n$$ N_{total} = A P \\Delta p \\int_{0}^{T} \\frac{1}{t_0 + rt} dt $$\nThe integral is of the form $\\int \\frac{dx}{a+bx} = \\frac{1}{b}\\ln|a+bx|$. Evaluating the definite integral gives:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{T} \\frac{1}{t_0 + rt} dt = \\left[ \\frac{1}{r} \\ln(t_0 + rt) \\right]_{0}^{T} $$\nSince $t_0, r, T$ are all positive, the argument of the logarithm is always positive.\n$$ = \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\ln(t_0 + rT) - \\ln(t_0) \\right) = \\frac{1}{r} \\ln\\left(\\frac{t_0 + rT}{t_0}\\right) = \\frac{1}{r} \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{rT}{t_0}\\right) $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $N_{total}$ yields the final analytical expression for the cumulative water loss:\n$$ N_{total} = \\frac{A P \\Delta p}{r} \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{rT}{t_0}\\right) $$\nNow, we proceed with the numerical evaluation.

With a window length $L = 6$ hours and a minimum increment threshold $\\delta = 5 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$, we seek the smallest time index $i$ that satisfies the condition. The increment over a window, $\\Delta U(i, L)$, is defined differently for the initial point:\n-   For $i = 0$: $\\Delta U(0, L) = U(L-1) - U(0)$\n-   For $i \\ge 1$: $\\Delta U(i, L) = U(i+L-1) - U(i-1)$\n\nThe onset time, $i^\\star$, is the smallest integer index $i \\ge 0$ for which the following inequality holds:\n$$\n\\Delta U(i, L) \\ge \\delta\n$$\nIf no such index $i$ exists within the time series domain for any test case, the result is reported as $-1$.\n\nThis complete, specified procedure is applied to each of the three test cases, which are distinguished by their respective irreversible growth functions $G(t)$ and maximum time $t_{\\max}$:\n-   Case A: $t_{\\max} = 72$. Growth $G(t) = 0$ for $t  36$, and $G(t) = 1.2(t-36)$ for $t \\ge 36$.\n-   Case B: $t_{\\max} = 48$. Growth $G(t) = 0$ for all $t$.\n-   Case C: $t_{\\max} = 24$. Growth $G(t) = 1.2t$ for all $t$.\n\nThe algorithm is executed for each case to determine the corresponding onset time $i^\\star$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the problem for the three specified test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Fundamental Constants and Parameters ---\n    R0 = 10000.0  # micrometers\n    BETA = 0.2     # micrometers per degree Celsius\n    T_REF = 20.0   # degrees Celsius\n    A_T = 8.0      # degrees Celsius\n    P = 24.0       # hours\n    A_E = 6.0      # micrometers\n    L = 6          # samples (hours)\n    DELTA = 5.0    # micrometers\n\n    def process_case(t_max, g_func):\n        \"\"\"\n        Processes a single test case to find the growth onset time.\n\n        Args:\n            t_max (int): The maximum time in hours for the simulation.\n            g_func (callable): A function G(t) that returns the irreversible growth.\n\n        Returns:\n            int: The onset time index, or -1 if no onset is detected.\n        \"\"\"\n        # 1.
