The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions, variables, and constants for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The numerical values provided are physiologically realistic for arterial blood in a healthy vertebrate. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe derivation and solution proceed.\n\nThe total oxygen content in whole blood, denoted as $C_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$, is the sum of two distinct components: the oxygen chemically bound to the respiratory pigment (hemoglobin) and the oxygen physically dissolved in the blood plasma. We can express this fundamental relationship as:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{O}_2} = C_{\\mathrm{HbO}_2} + C_{\\mathrm{dissolved\\,O}_2}$$\nwhere $C_{\\mathrm{HbO}_2}$ is the concentration of hemoglobin-bound oxygen and $C_{\\mathrm{dissolved\\,O}_2}$ is the concentration of dissolved oxygen. We shall derive an expression for each component from the provided definitions.\n\nFirst, consider the hemoglobin-bound oxygen, $C_{\\mathrm{HbO}_2}$. The maximum amount of oxygen that can be bound by hemoglobin per unit volume of blood is defined as the oxygen-carrying capacity. This capacity is the product of the hemoglobin concentration, $[\\mathrm{Hb}]$, and the maximal amount of oxygen that one gram of hemoglobin can bind, which is the Hüfner constant, $H$.\n$$\\text{Maximal O}_2\\text{ capacity} = [\\mathrm{Hb}] \\times H$$\nA dimensional analysis confirms the correctness of this expression for a concentration:\n$$\\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{dL}} \\right] \\times \\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{mL\\,O}_2}{\\mathrm{g}} \\right] = \\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{mL\\,O}_2}{\\mathrm{dL}} \\right]$$\nThe actual amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin is this maximal capacity multiplied by the fractional saturation, $Y$. The fractional saturation $Y$ represents the proportion of available oxygen-binding sites on the hemoglobin molecules that are actually occupied by oxygen.\nTherefore, the concentration of oxygen bound to hemoglobin is:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{HbO}_2} = H \\times [\\mathrm{Hb}] \\times Y$$\n\nSecond, we consider the physically dissolved oxygen, $C_{\\mathrm{dissolved\\,O}_2}$. According to Henry’s law, the concentration of a gas dissolved in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas in the gaseous phase in equilibrium with the liquid. The constant of proportionality is the solubility coefficient, $\\alpha$.\nThus, for oxygen dissolved in blood, the relationship is:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{dissolved\\,O}_2} = \\alpha \\times p_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$$\nA dimensional analysis again confirms the validity of this expression:\n$$\\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{mL\\,O}_2}{\\mathrm{dL} \\cdot \\mathrm{mmHg}} \\right] \\times \\left[ \\mathrm{mmHg} \\right] = \\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{mL\\,O}_2}{\\mathrm{dL}} \\right]$$\n\nBy substituting the expressions for the two components back into the initial equation, we obtain the complete expression for the total whole-blood oxygen content, $C_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{O}_2} = (H \\times [\\mathrm{Hb}] \\times Y) + (\\alpha \\times p_{\\mathrm{O}_2})$$\nThis is the required expression derived from first principles.\n\nNow, we proceed to the numerical evaluation using the given values:\n- $H = 1.34\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2\\,g^{-1}}$\n- $[\\mathrm{Hb}] = 15\\,\\mathrm{g\\,dL^{-1}}$\n- $Y = 0.95$\n- $\\alpha = 0.0031\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2\\,dL^{-1}\\,mmHg^{-1}}$\n- $p_{\\mathrm{O}_2} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived equation:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{O}_2} = (1.34 \\times 15 \\times 0.95) + (0.0031 \\times 100)$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of hemoglobin-bound oxygen:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{HbO}_2} = 1.34 \\times 15 \\times 0.95 = 20.1 \\times 0.95 = 19.095\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2\\,dL^{-1}}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the concentration of dissolved oxygen:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{dissolved\\,O}_2} = 0.0031 \\times 100 = 0.31\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2\\,dL^{-1}}$$\n\nFinally, we sum these two components to find the total oxygen content:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{O}_2} = 19.095 + 0.31 = 19.405\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2\\,dL^{-1}}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
