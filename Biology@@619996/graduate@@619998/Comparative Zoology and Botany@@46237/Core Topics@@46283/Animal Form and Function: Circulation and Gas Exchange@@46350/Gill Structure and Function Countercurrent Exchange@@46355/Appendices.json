Consider a single lamellar barrier of uniform thickness and area that is bathed on the water side by flowing water and on the blood side by flowing blood such that the partial pressure difference of oxygen across the barrier is maintained along its length by countercurrent flow. Assume steady state, one-dimensional diffusion normal to the barrier, no reaction within the barrier, negligible interfacial (stagnant layer) resistances, and constant transport properties within the barrier. The dissolved oxygen concentration within the barrier is proportional to its partial pressure via Henry’s law with a water-phase solubility coefficient.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of mass transfer, specifically the effectiveness-NTU method applied to biological countercurrent exchangers. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and constitutive relations. The data are internally consistent and physically plausible. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or logical flaws. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to determine three key dimensionless parameters for a fish gill modeled as a countercurrent mass exchanger: the capacity ratio $C_r$, the effectiveness $\\varepsilon$, and the Number of Transfer Units $\\mathrm{NTU}$. This will be done for several sets of given operational data.\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n\nFirst, for each test case, we are given the water-side capacity rate $C_w$, the blood-side capacity rate $C_b$, and the partial pressures of oxygen at the inlets and outlets of the gill for both water ($P_{w,\\mathrm{in}}$, $P_{w,\\mathrm{out}}$) and blood ($P_{b,\\mathrm{in}}$, $P_{b,\\mathrm{out}}$).\n\nThe rate of oxygen transfer, $N$, must be conserved. The flux from water must equal the flux to blood at steady state. The problem states that due to experimental noise, we must estimate $N$ as the arithmetic mean of the rates calculated from the water side and the blood side.\nThe rate of oxygen loss from water is given by:\n$$ N_w = C_w\\,(P_{w,\\mathrm{in}} - P_{w,\\mathrm{out}}) $$\nThe rate of oxygen gain by blood is given by:\n$$ N_b = C_b\\,(P_{b,\\mathrm{out}} - P_{b,\\mathrm{in}}) $$\nThe estimated actual transfer rate $N$ is therefore:\n$$ N = \\frac{N_w + N_b}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ C_w\\,(P_{w,\\mathrm{in}} - P_{w,\\mathrm{out}}) + C_b\\,(P_{b,\\mathrm{out}} - P_{b,\\mathrm{in}}) \\right] $$\n\nSecond, we compute the capacity ratio, $C_r$. This is the ratio of the smaller capacity rate to the larger one. The capacity rates are $C_w$ and $C_b$. We define:\n$$ C_{\\min} = \\min(C_w, C_b) $$\n$$ C_{\\max} = \\max(C_w, C_b) $$\nThe capacity ratio is then:\n$$ C_r = \\frac{C_{\\min}}{C_{\\max}} $$\nBy definition, $C_r$ is a dimensionless quantity such that $0 \\le C_r \\le 1$.\n\nThird, we compute the exchanger effectiveness, $\\varepsilon$. Effectiveness is defined as the ratio of the actual transfer rate $N$ to the maximum possible transfer rate, $N_{\\max}$. The maximum possible rate is determined by the fluid stream with the minimum capacity rate ($C_{\\min}$) and the maximum available partial pressure difference, which is the difference between the two fluids at their inlets, $P_{w,\\mathrm{in}} - P_{b,\\mathrm{in}}$.\n$$ N_{\\max} = C_{\\min}\\,(P_{w,\\mathrm{in}} - P_{b,\\mathrm{in}}) $$\nThe effectiveness is thus:\n$$ \\varepsilon = \\frac{N}{N_{\\max}} = \\frac{N}{C_{\\min}\\,(P_{w,\\mathrm{in}} - P_{b,\\mathrm{in}})} $$\nEffectiveness $\\varepsilon$ is also dimensionless, with $0 \\le \\varepsilon \\le 1$.\n\nFourth, we determine the Number of Transfer Units, $\\mathrm{NTU}$. This parameter quantifies the \"size\" or transfer capability of the exchanger. It is related to effectiveness $\\varepsilon$ and capacity ratio $C_r$ through a known analytical relationship derived from the fundamental model of a countercurrent exchanger. The task requires us to invert this relationship to find $\\mathrm{NTU}$ from our calculated $\\varepsilon$ and $C_r$.\n\nThe standard effectiveness-NTU relation for a countercurrent exchanger depends on the value of $C_r$.\n\nFor the general case where $C_r < 1$:\n$$ \\varepsilon = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\mathrm{NTU}\\,(1-C_r))}{1 - C_r\\,\\exp(-\\mathrm{NTU}\\,(1-C_r))} $$\nTo solve for $\\mathrm{NTU}$, we must rearrange this equation. Let $X = \\exp(-\\mathrm{NTU}\\,(1-C_r))$. The equation becomes $\\varepsilon = (1-X) / (1-C_r X)$. Solving for $X$ yields $X = (1-\\varepsilon) / (1-\\varepsilon C_r)$. Substituting back for $X$ and taking the natural logarithm:\n$$ \\exp(-\\mathrm{NTU}\\,(1-C_r)) = \\frac{1 - \\varepsilon}{1 - \\varepsilon C_r} $$\n$$ -\\mathrm{NTU}\\,(1-C_r) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - \\varepsilon}{1 - \\varepsilon C_r}\\right) $$\nFinally, isolating $\\mathrm{NTU}$ gives the inverse relation:\n$$ \\mathrm{NTU} = \\frac{1}{1-C_r} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - \\varepsilon C_r}{1 - \\varepsilon}\\right) $$\nThis analytical solution is used for all cases where $C_r$ is not equal to $1$. The formula is numerically stable for $C_r \\to 0$, in which case it correctly simplifies to $\\mathrm{NTU} = -\\ln(1-\\varepsilon)$.\n\nFor the special case where capacity rates are balanced, $C_r = 1$:\nThe relationship simplifies significantly. The derivation using L'Hôpital's rule on the general case, or by re-deriving from the fundamental differential equations, yields:\n$$ \\varepsilon = \\frac{\\mathrm{NTU}}{1 + \\mathrm{NTU}} $$\nInverting this for $\\mathrm{NTU}$ is trivial:\n$$ \\varepsilon (1 + \\mathrm{NTU}) = \\mathrm{NTU} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{NTU}\\,(1 - \\varepsilon) = \\varepsilon $$\n$$ \\mathrm{NTU} = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{1 - \\varepsilon} $$\nThis special-case formula is essential for robustness, as the general formula becomes indeterminate ($0/0$ form in the logarithm argument multiplied by infinity) when $C_r = 1$. In implementation, a small tolerance must be used to check if $C_r$ is close to $1$ due to floating-point arithmetic.\n\nThe computation for each test case proceeds by applying these four steps systematically. The final results for $\\varepsilon$, $\\mathrm{NTU}$, and $C_r$ are rounded to $6$ decimal places as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\text{[0.720065,1.800720,0.625000,0.618589,1.000000,0.100000,0.415191,0.700000,0.960000,0.928000,5.000000,0.666667,0.545455,1.200000,1.000000]}}$$", "id": "2579056"}]}
