It is based on the Navier-Stokes equation, a cornerstone of fluid mechanics. The application to hemolymph flow in an insect is a standard exercise in biological fluid dynamics. The provided parameter values for density, viscosity, speed, and conduit size are physiologically realistic for an insect.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

The units are consistent, although they require conversion to a single system (SI) for calculation. There are no internal contradictions.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. It is a straightforward application of dimensional analysis to the Navier-Stokes equation. We can now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe starting point is the momentum equation for an incompressible Newtonian fluid, also known as the Navier-Stokes equation. For steady flow, and neglecting body forces such as gravity which are typically insignificant compared to pressure and viscous forces at this scale, the equation in vector form is:\n$$\n\\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v} = -\\nabla p + \\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}\n$$\nIn this equation, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $\\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity vector field, $p$ is the pressure field, and $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity. The term on the left, $\\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v}$, represents the inertial force per unit volume arising from fluid advection. The second term on the right, $\\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}$, represents the viscous force per unit volume.\n\nTo find the dimensionless ratio that quantifies the relative importance of inertial to viscous forces, we perform a scale analysis on these two terms. We use the characteristic scales provided: characteristic length $D$ and characteristic speed $U$.\n\nThe magnitude of the differential operators can be estimated based on these scales. The gradient operator, $\\nabla$, involves derivatives with respect to spatial coordinates, so its magnitude scales as the reciprocal of the characteristic length, $\\mathcal{O}(D^{-1})$. The Laplacian operator, $\\nabla^2$, involves second derivatives, so its magnitude scales as $\\mathcal{O}(D^{-2})$.\n\nThe magnitude of the inertial term is therefore estimated as:\n$$\n|\\text{Inertial Term}| \\sim |\\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v}| \\sim \\rho (U \\cdot \\frac{1}{D}) U = \\frac{\\rho U^2}{D}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the viscous term is estimated as:\n$$\n|\\text{Viscous Term}| \\sim |\\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}| \\sim \\eta \\frac{U}{D^2}\n$$\nThe dimensionless ratio of inertial to viscous forces is the ratio of the magnitudes of these two terms:\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{|\\text{Inertial Term}|}{|\\text{Viscous Term}|} \\sim \\frac{\\rho U^2 / D}{\\eta U / D^2} = \\frac{\\rho U D}{\\eta}\n$$\nThis fundamental dimensionless group in fluid mechanics is the Reynolds number, denoted $Re$.\n$$\nRe = \\frac{\\rho U D}{\\eta}\n$$\nNow, we must calculate the numerical value of this ratio. All parameters must first be converted to a consistent system of units, the SI system.\n- Density: $\\rho = 1000 \\text{ kg m}^{-3}$ (already in SI units)\n- Characteristic speed: $U = 5 \\text{ mm s}^{-1} = 5 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m s}^{-1}$\n- Characteristic diameter: $D = 0.5 \\text{ mm} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m}$\n- Dynamic viscosity: $\\eta = 1.5 \\text{ mPa} \\cdot \\text{s} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ Pa} \\cdot \\text{s}$. Since $1 \\text{ Pa} = 1 \\text{ N m}^{-2} = 1 \\text{ kg m}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-2}$, then $1 \\text{ Pa} \\cdot \\text{s} = 1 \\text{ kg m}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-1}$. Thus, $\\eta = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ kg m}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the Reynolds number:\n$$\nRe = \\frac{(1000 \\text{ kg m}^{-3}) \\cdot (5 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m s}^{-1}) \\cdot (0.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m})}{1.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ kg m}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-1}}\n$$\nLet's compute the value:\n$$\nRe = \\frac{1000 \\cdot (5 \\cdot 0.5) \\times 10^{-6}}{1.5 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot 2.5 \\times 10^{-6}}{1.5 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.5 \\times 10^{-3}}\n$$\n$$\nRe = \\frac{2.5}{1.5} = \\frac{5/2}{3/2} = \\frac{5}{3}\n$$\nThe exact value is $5/3$. The problem requires rounding the numerical answer to three significant figures.\n$$\nRe \\approx 1.666...\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, the result is $1.67$. This value is dimensionless, as expected. A Reynolds number much less than $2000$ indicates that the flow is strongly laminar, meaning viscous forces dominate over inertial forces. This leads to orderly, non-mixing flow, which has significant implications for nutrient and waste transport in an open circulatory system compared to the typically turbulent flow in large vessels of closed systems.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.67}\n$$", "id": "2592542"}, {"introduction": "The evolution of circulatory systems involves significant energetic trade-offs.
