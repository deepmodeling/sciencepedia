This exercise challenges you to derive, from first principles, the effect of central fusion automixis on heterozygosity for a single gene.

Assume the standard tetrad model of meiosis with no chromatid interference and normal disjunction, and that diploidy is restored by central fusion, meaning one haploid product from each of the two first-division dyads fuses to form the offspring’s nucleus. Let the recombination fraction between the locus and its centromere be $r$ in the sense of ordered tetrad analysis (i.e., the standard locus–centromere recombination distance).\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions of first-division segregation and second-division segregation and the classical ordered tetrad framework, derive a closed-form expression in terms of $r$ for the probability that the diploid parthenogenetic offspring retains heterozygosity at the locus after one generation of central fusion automixis. Express your final answer as a single analytic expression in $r$. No numerical evaluation or rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the probability that an offspring produced by central fusion automixis retains the heterozygosity of its mother at a given locus. We begin by analyzing the meiotic process and segregation patterns.\n\nThe mother is diploid and heterozygous at a locus with alleles $A$ and $a$. Her genotype is $A/a$. Prior to meiosis, DNA replication occurs, so the bivalent for the homologous pair of chromosomes contains four chromatids. One replicated chromosome consists of two sister chromatids, both carrying allele $A$, and the other consists of two sister chromatids, both carrying allele $a$.\n\nThe genetic outcome of meiosis depends on whether a crossover occurs between the locus and its centromere. This gives rise to two segregation patterns for the alleles:\n\n1.  **First-Division Segregation (FDS)**: This pattern occurs when there is no crossover between the locus and the centromere. During anaphase I, the homologous chromosomes separate. One secondary meiocyte receives the replicated chromosome with two $A$ chromatids, and the other receives the replicated chromosome with two $a$ chromatids. The alleles $A$ and $a$ segregate at the first meiotic division.\n\n2.  **Second-Division Segregation (SDS)**: This pattern occurs when there is a single crossover between the locus and the centromere. As a result of the crossover, each replicated chromosome entering anaphase I is now heterozygous, carrying one chromatid with allele $A$ and one with allele $a$. Therefore, the alleles $A$ and $a$ do not segregate until the second meiotic division, when sister chromatids separate.\n\nThe problem provides the recombination fraction $r$ between the locus and the centromere, defined in the context of ordered tetrad analysis. In this framework, the recombination fraction $r$ is equal to half the frequency of tetrads showing second-division segregation. This is because an SDS tetrad contains two recombinant and two non-recombinant products out of four.\nLet $P(\\text{FDS})$ and $P(\\text{SDS})$ be the probabilities of FDS and SDS patterns occurring, respectively. From the definition of $r$:\n$$r = \\frac{1}{2} P(\\text{SDS})$$\nThis implies:\n$$P(\\text{SDS}) = 2r$$\nSince FDS and SDS are the only two possibilities for a single locus:\n$$P(\\text{FDS}) = 1 - P(\\text{SDS}) = 1 - 2r$$\nThis model is valid for recombination fractions $r$ such that $0 \\le r \\le \\frac{1}{2}$, which ensures $P(\\text{SDS}) \\le 1$.\n\nNext, we analyze the consequences of central fusion automixis for each segregation pattern. Central fusion is defined as the fusion of one haploid product from each of the two dyads formed at the end of meiosis I.\n\n**Case 1: FDS occurs (with probability $1 - 2r$)**\nAt the end of meiosis I, one dyad contains two chromatids of type $A$, and the other dyad contains two chromatids of type $a$.\n- The first dyad undergoes meiosis II, producing two haploid nuclei, both with genotype $A$.\n- The second dyad undergoes meiosis II, producing two haploid nuclei, both with genotype $a$.\nCentral fusion involves fusing one nucleus from the first dyad's products (which must be $A$) with one nucleus from the second dyad's products (which must be $a$). The resulting diploid offspring will have the genotype $A/a$.\nTherefore, if FDS occurs, the offspring is guaranteed to be heterozygous. The probability of retaining heterozygosity, given FDS, is $1$.\n$$P(\\text{Heterozygous} | \\text{FDS}) = 1$$\n\n**Case 2: SDS occurs (with probability $2r$)**\nAt the end of meiosis I, due to the crossover, both dyads are heterozygous. Each dyad contains one chromatid of type $A$ and one of type $a$.\n- The first dyad undergoes meiosis II, producing one haploid nucleus with genotype $A$ and one with genotype $a$. The probability of randomly selecting an $A$ nucleus is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of selecting an $a$ nucleus is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Similarly, the second dyad's meiotic products are one $A$ nucleus and one $a$ nucleus. The selection probabilities are also $\\frac{1}{2}$ for $A$ and $\\frac{1}{2}$ for $a$.\nCentral fusion combines one random nucleus from the first lineage and one from the second. The possible genotypes of the offspring are:\n- $A/A$: by fusing an $A$ nucleus from the first dyad and an $A$ nucleus from the second. The probability is $P(A_1 \\cap A_2) = P(A_1)P(A_2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n- $a/a$: by fusing an $a$ nucleus from the first dyad and an $a$ nucleus from the second. The probability is $P(a_1 \\cap a_2) = P(a_1)P(a_2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n- $A/a$: by fusing an $A$ from the first and an $a$ from the second, or an $a$ from the first and an $A$ from the second. The probability is $P(A_1 \\cap a_2) + P(a_1 \\cap A_2) = (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nTherefore, if SDS occurs, the probability that the offspring is heterozygous is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n$$P(\\text{Heterozygous} | \\text{SDS}) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\n**Total Probability of Retaining Heterozygosity**\nWe can now calculate the total probability of the offspring being heterozygous, $P(\\text{Het})$, by applying the law of total probability:\n$$P(\\text{Het}) = P(\\text{Het} | \\text{FDS}) \\cdot P(\\text{FDS}) + P(\\text{Het} | \\text{SDS}) \\cdot P(\\text{SDS})$$\nSubstituting the values we have derived:\n$$P(\\text{Het}) = (1) \\cdot (1 - 2r) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\cdot (2r)$$\n$$P(\\text{Het}) = 1 - 2r + r$$\n$$P(\\text{Het}) = 1 - r$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the probability that the parthenogenetic offspring retains heterozygosity at the locus after one generation of central fusion automixis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1-r}$$", "id": "2595264"}, {"introduction": "True mastery of a biological process comes from understanding not just how it works, but *why* it works that way. This thought experiment asks you to explore the consequences of a hypothetical 'inverted meiosis,' where sister chromatids separate before homologs. By comparing the outcomes of central and terminal fusion under this scenario to the canonical process, you will gain a much deeper intuition for the chromosomal logic that governs heterozygosity in automixis [@problem_id:2595290].", "problem": "A number of animal lineages that reproduce via automixis show either canonical meiosis (homologs separate in meiosis I and sister chromatids in meiosis II) or inverted meiosis (sister chromatids separate in meiosis I and homologs in meiosis II). In automixis, diploidy is restored by fusion of meiotic products: in central fusion, the two products of meiosis I fuse; in terminal fusion, the egg nucleus fuses with the second polar body (the two products of meiosis II). Consider a diploid female that is heterozygous at a single locus $L$ on a chromosome, with recombination fraction $r$ between $L$ and the centromere. Assume a single bivalent, no chromatid interference, and at most one crossover in the interval between $L$ and the centromere.\n\nUsing only core definitions of meiotic chromosome behavior (tetrad formation, crossing over, reductional versus equational segregation) and the definitions of central and terminal fusion above, reason from first principles about how inverted meiosis changes heterozygosity outcomes at $L$ relative to canonical meiosis. Which of the following statements are correct?\n\nA. Under inverted meiosis, central fusion tends to preserve heterozygosity at $L$ for loci far from the centromere (large $r$) and to erode it for loci near the centromere (small $r$), mimicking the distal-versus-proximal pattern seen under terminal fusion with canonical meiosis.\n\nB. Under inverted meiosis, terminal fusion tends to preserve heterozygosity at $L$ for loci near the centromere (small $r$) and to erode it for loci far from the centromere (large $r$), mimicking the proximal-versus-distal pattern seen under central fusion with canonical meiosis.\n\nC. Inverted meiosis does not alter the positional pattern of heterozygosity preservation: under central fusion, heterozygosity remains highest near the centromere and under terminal fusion it remains highest near the telomere, exactly as in canonical meiosis.\n\nD. Under inverted meiosis with no crossover between $L$ and the centromere (i.e., $r=0$), terminal fusion produces complete homozygosity at $L$ in the parthenogenetic offspring.\n\nE. Under inverted meiosis, the expected heterozygosity at $L$ after central fusion is an increasing function of $r$, whereas after terminal fusion it is a decreasing function of $r$, when $r$ is interpreted as the probability of a single crossover between $L$ and the centromere.", "solution": "Begin with core definitions. In canonical meiosis, meiosis I is reductional: homologous chromosomes disjoin, so each meiosis I product carries both sister chromatids of one homolog. Meiosis II is equational: sister chromatids separate. In inverted meiosis, the order is reversed: meiosis I is equational (sisters separate), and meiosis II is reductional (homologs disjoin).\n\nIn automixis, central fusion means the two meiosis I products fuse; terminal fusion means the two meiosis II products (the egg nucleus and the second polar body) fuse. Heterozygosity at a locus $L$ in the restored diploid depends on whether the two fusing products carry different alleles at $L$.\n\nWe reason about proximity to the centromere via the crossover location. Let $r$ denote the probability of a single crossover between $L$ and the centromere, with $0 \\le r \\le 1/2$ under the single-crossover assumption. A locus near the centromere has small $r$; a locus far from the centromere has large $r$.\n\nFirst consider canonical meiosis as a baseline. At $r=0$ (no crossover between $L$ and the centromere), central fusion fuses reductional products that differ at the centromere: one product carries the maternal homolog and the other the paternal homolog. Without a crossover between the centromere and $L$, the allelic state at $L$ co-segregates with the centromere, so the fused products carry different alleles at $L$, yielding complete heterozygosity. By contrast, terminal fusion fuses equational products (sister products) that, when $r=0$, are identical at $L$, producing homozygosity. When a crossover occurs between $L$ and the centromere (i.e., with probability $r$), it can decouple the allele at $L$ from its original centromere, which reduces heterozygosity under central fusion (because the two reductional products may now carry the same allele at $L$) but increases heterozygosity under terminal fusion (because sister chromatids can become different at $L$). Thus, under canonical meiosis, central fusion preserves heterozygosity near the centromere and erodes it distally, whereas terminal fusion does the opposite.\n\nNow invert the order of chromosome segregation. Under inverted meiosis, meiosis I is equational and meiosis II is reductional.\n\n- Central fusion under inverted meiosis fuses the two meiosis I products, which are equational products (separated sister chromatids). At $r=0$, sister chromatids are identical at $L$, so fusing the meiosis I products yields homozygosity at $L$ (heterozygosity $=0$). If a single crossover occurs between the centromere and $L$ with probability $r$, one sister can carry the alternative allele at $L$; thus the two equational products can differ at $L$, making heterozygosity possible. Consequently, as $r$ increases (locus more distal), the chance of heterozygosity after central fusion increases. This is the same distal-versus-proximal pattern that terminal fusion exhibits under canonical meiosis.\n\n- Terminal fusion under inverted meiosis fuses the two meiosis II products, which are reductional products (separated homologs). At $r=0$, reductional products differ at $L$ (each carries a different homolog’s allele), so fusion yields complete heterozygosity at $L$ (heterozygosity $=1$). A crossover between the centromere and $L$ can swap the allele at $L$ onto the other centromere, so the two reductional products can end up carrying the same allele at $L$, decreasing heterozygosity as $r$ increases. This is the same proximal-versus-distal pattern that central fusion exhibits under canonical meiosis.\n\nThese conclusions can be checked at the extremes. At $r=0$:\n- Under inverted meiosis with central fusion (equational products), the fused units are identical at $L$, yielding homozygosity (heterozygosity $=0$).\n- Under inverted meiosis with terminal fusion (reductional products), the fused units carry different homologs and therefore different alleles at $L$, yielding complete heterozygosity (heterozygosity $=1$).\n\nAt larger $r$ (approaching $1/2$ under the single-crossover model), equational products are more likely to differ at $L$ (increasing heterozygosity under central fusion), while reductional products are more likely to become allelically identical at $L$ due to the crossover having decoupled $L$ from its original centromere (decreasing heterozygosity under terminal fusion).\n\nWith this principled mapping established, evaluate each option:\n\nA. This states that under inverted meiosis, central fusion preserves heterozygosity distally and erodes it proximally, mimicking terminal fusion under canonical meiosis. As reasoned above, central fusion under inverted meiosis fuses equational products, which are identical at $L$ when $r=0$ and become more different as $r$ increases. Hence heterozygosity increases with $r$, i.e., preserved distally and eroded proximally. Correct.\n\nB. This states that under inverted meiosis, terminal fusion preserves heterozygosity proximally and erodes it distally, mimicking central fusion under canonical meiosis. Under inverted meiosis, terminal fusion fuses reductional products, which are fully heterozygous at $r=0$ and lose heterozygosity as $r$ increases. Correct.\n\nC. This claims there is no change. That contradicts the flip just derived: the positional patterns swap under inverted meiosis. Incorrect.\n\nD. This claims that under inverted meiosis with $r=0$, terminal fusion yields complete homozygosity. As shown, terminal fusion under inverted meiosis fuses reductional products, which at $r=0$ carry different homologs and thus different alleles at $L$, giving complete heterozygosity, not homozygosity. Incorrect.\n\nE. This claims that under inverted meiosis, expected heterozygosity after central fusion increases with $r$, and after terminal fusion decreases with $r$. This is exactly the qualitative monotonic relationship derived from equational versus reductional fusion under inverted meiosis.

This practice guides you to model the spread of a rare, parthenogenesis-inducing symbiont in a sexual host population, a scenario observed in many arthropods. By deriving the invasion condition, you will quantitatively capture the famous 'two-fold cost of sex' and understand the trade-offs between reproductive efficiency and the fitness cost $c$ that determine the fate of asexual lineages [@problem_id:2595272].", "problem": "In many arthropods, maternally inherited bacteria can induce thelytokous parthenogenesis in their hosts. Consider a panmictic, discrete-generation host population at demographic equilibrium with equal numbers of daughters and sons among sexually reproducing hosts. Assume that in the resident sexual population, each female produces on average $1$ adult daughter and $1$ adult son per generation (so the average number of adult daughters per mother is $1$), consistent with Fisher’s equal-investment principle under density regulation.\n\nA rare maternally inherited symbiont appears that induces thelytokous parthenogenesis in infected females. An infected female produces only daughters, and each daughter independently inherits the symbiont from her mother with probability $t \\in (0,1]$. Infection imposes a multiplicative fitness cost $c \\in [0,1)$ on infected females such that, relative to an uninfected sexual female, the total number of viable adult offspring produced by an infected female is reduced by a factor of $(1-c)$. There is no paternal or horizontal transmission, mating is not required for infected females, and density regulation continues to maintain the resident demographic equilibrium as the symbiont remains rare.\n\nStarting only from these fundamental principles and definitions (maternally inherited transmission, equal sex ratio equilibrium in sexuals, and demographic equilibrium implying one adult daughter per sexual mother on average), derive the closed-form expression for the critical cost function $c^{*}(t)$ such that the symbiont increases in frequency from rarity if and only if $c < c^{*}(t)$.

The invasion analysis will be based on comparing the reproductive rate of the rare infected lineage to that of the resident uninfected lineage.\n\nLet us define the per-capita, per-generation growth rate of a lineage as the average number of female offspring produced by a single female that survive to reproductive age and belong to the same lineage. The symbiont will successfully invade (i.e., increase in frequency when rare) if the growth rate of the infected female lineage, $\\lambda_{I}$, is greater than the growth rate of the resident uninfected (sexual) female lineage, $\\lambda_{U}$. The condition for invasion is $\\lambda_{I} > \\lambda_{U}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the growth rate of the resident uninfected lineage, $\\lambda_{U}$. The problem states that the host population is at a demographic equilibrium where a sexual female produces, on average, $1$ adult daughter. This implies that each uninfected mother exactly replaces herself in the next generation in terms of female offspring. Therefore, the growth rate of the uninfected female lineage is:\n$$\n\\lambda_{U} = 1\n$$\n\nNext, we must determine the growth rate of the infected lineage, $\\lambda_{I}$. This is the expected number of infected daughters produced by a single infected female. We can calculate this as follows:\n\n1.  An uninfected sexual female produces $1$ adult daughter and $1$ adult son. Her total number of viable adult offspring is therefore $1 + 1 = 2$.\n2.  The problem states that infection imposes a multiplicative fitness cost $c \\in [0,1)$, reducing the total number of viable adult offspring by a factor of $(1-c)$ relative to an uninfected female. So, the total number of adult offspring produced by an infected female is $2(1-c)$.\n3.  Infected females are thelytokous and produce only daughters. Thus, an infected female produces $2(1-c)$ adult daughters.\n4.  The symbiont is transmitted vertically from mother to daughter with a probability $t \\in (0,1]$. Therefore, the expected number of *infected* daughters produced by an infected mother is the total number of daughters multiplied by the transmission probability.\n\nThis gives the per-capita growth rate for the infected lineage:\n$$\n\\lambda_{I} = (2(1-c)) \\times t = 2t(1-c)\n$$\n\nThe condition for the symbiont to increase in frequency from rarity is $\\lambda_{I} > \\lambda_{U}$. Substituting the expressions for the growth rates, we get:\n$$\n2t(1-c) > 1\n$$\nThis inequality shows that the symbiont invades if the cost of infection, $c$, is sufficiently low. The problem asks for the critical cost, $c^{*}(t)$, such that invasion occurs if and only if $c < c^{*}(t)$. This critical value is found at the boundary where the inequality becomes an equality, representing the point where the infected lineage has the same growth rate as the uninfected lineage.\n$$\n2t(1-c^{*}(t)) = 1\n$$\nWe now solve this equation for $c^{*}(t)$ to obtain the critical cost function.\n$$\n1 - c^{*}(t) = \\frac{1}{2t}\n$$\n$$\nc^{*}(t) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2t}\n$$\nThis expression is the critical cost. If the actual cost $c$ is less than $c^{*}(t)$, the per-capita growth rate of the infected lineage will be greater than $1$, and the symbiont will spread. If $c$ is greater than or equal to $c^{*}(t)$, the symbiont will not spread. For invasion to be possible at all with a non-negative cost ($c \\ge 0$), we must have $c^{*}(t) > 0$, which implies $1 - \\frac{1}{2t} > 0$, or $t > \\frac{1}{2}$.
