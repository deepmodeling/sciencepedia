It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed, permitting a rigorous and unique analytical solution. The derivation proceeds as follows.\n\nThe objective is to determine the minimal exchange surface area, $A$, required to sustain a fetus of mass $M$. The solution is found by equating the rate of metabolic oxygen demand with the rate of oxygen supply across the placental barrier.\n\nFirst, we establish the rate of oxygen demand. The fetal metabolic power, $B$, which represents energy consumed per unit time, is given by the allometric scaling relation:\n$$B(M) = b M^{3/4}$$\nwhere $b$ is a proportionality constant and $M$ is the fetal mass.\n\nThe problem states that all metabolic energy is derived from aerobic respiration, with an energetic yield of $e$ per mole of molecular oxygen ($\\mathrm{O_2}$) consumed. Let $\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{O_2, demand}}$ be the molar rate of oxygen consumption required to meet this metabolic demand. The metabolic power $B$ is then the product of this consumption rate and the energy yield per mole:\n$$B = \\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{O_2, demand}} \\cdot e$$\n\nBy substituting the expression for $B(M)$, we can solve for the demand rate of oxygen:\n$$\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{O_2, demand}} = \\frac{B(M)}{e} = \\frac{b M^{3/4}}{e}$$\n\nNext, we define the rate of oxygen supply. The problem provides a linear driving-force model for oxygen transport across the hemochorial placenta, which is a form of Fick's first law. The molar flux of oxygen, $\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{O_2, supply}}$, is given by:\n$$\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{O_2, supply}} = \\kappa A \\Delta P$$\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the effective mass-transfer coefficient, $A$ is the exchange surface area, and $\\Delta P$ is the mean oxygen partial pressure difference across the maternal-fetal interface.\n\nThe core principle for solving this problem is the steady-state assumption, which posits that oxygen supply must exactly match oxygen demand. This is the condition for the minimal required surface area; any smaller area would result in an oxygen deficit. Therefore, we set the supply rate equal to the demand rate:\n$$\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{O_2, supply}} = \\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{O_2, demand}}$$\n$$\\kappa A \\Delta P = \\frac{b M^{3/4}}{e}$$\n\nFinally, we solve this equation for the exchange surface area, $A$. This is achieved by algebraic rearrangement, isolating $A$ on one side of the equation:\n$$A = \\frac{b M^{3/4}}{e \\kappa \\Delta P}$$\n\nThis expression provides the required exchange surface area $A$ in terms of the fetal mass $M$ and the given biophysical parameters $b$, $e$, $\\kappa$, and $\\Delta P$. The dimensional consistency of this result can be verified to ensure it correctly yields units of area ($L^2$).
