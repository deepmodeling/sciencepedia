Ventral tissue does not inject net BMP flux across the boundary and can be modeled as a no-flux boundary at $x=L$.

We consider a small segment of tissue of length $\\Delta x$ located at position $x$. The principle of conservation of mass states that the rate of change of the amount of BMP in this segment is equal to the net flux into the segment plus the rate of production minus the rate of degradation.\n\nThe mass of BMP in the segment is $B(x,t) \\Delta x$. The rate of change is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(B(x,t) \\Delta x)$.\nThe flux of BMP is given by Fick's first law: $J(x,t) = -D \\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial x}$, where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient.

The problem states that the protrusive force $F_p$ is counteracted by the lateral adhesion force $F_{\\mathrm{ad}}$, and the remainder is transmitted to the membrane. This constitutes the force balance equation in the direction normal to the membrane:\n$$F_p = F_{\\mathrm{ad}} + F_{\\mathrm{traction}}$$\nThis can be rearranged to express the transmitted traction:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{traction}} = F_p - F_{\\mathrm{ad}}$$\n\nIngression, defined as the yielding of the basement membrane, occurs when the transmitted traction reaches the yield force, $F_{\\mathrm{y}}$. At this threshold, we must have:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{traction}} = F_{\\mathrm{y}}$$\nThe problem defines the yield force as $F_{\\mathrm{y}} = \\sigma_y A_c$. Substituting this into the force balance at the threshold gives:\n$$\\sigma_y A_c = F_p - F_{\\mathrm{ad}}$$\n\nThe adhesion force $F_{\\mathrm{ad}}$ depends on the fractional E-cadherin level, $c$, according to the given relation $F_{\\mathrm{ad}}(c) = c\\,\\kappa L_j$. Let $c_{\\mathrm{th}}$ be the specific fractional E-cadherin level at which the ingression threshold is met. Substituting this into our equation yields:\n$$\\sigma_y A_c = F_p - c_{\\mathrm{th}}\\,\\kappa L_j$$\n\nOur objective is to find the fractional *reduction* in adhesion, $r_{\\mathrm{th}}$, not the final fractional level $c_{\\mathrm{th}}$. We use the given definition $r \\equiv 1-c$. At the threshold, this relationship is $r_{\\mathrm{th}} = 1 - c_{\\mathrm{th}}$, which implies $c_{\\mathrm{th}} = 1 - r_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\n\nWe substitute this expression for $c_{\\mathrm{th}}$ into the force balance equation:\n$$\\sigma_y A_c = F_p - (1 - r_{\\mathrm{th}})\\,\\kappa L_j$$\n\nNow, we must perform algebraic manipulation to isolate $r_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\n$$(1 - r_{\\mathrm{th}})\\,\\kappa L_j = F_p - \\sigma_y A_c$$\nDivide both sides by the term $\\kappa L_j$:\n$$1 - r_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\frac{F_p - \\sigma_y A_c}{\\kappa L_j}$$\nFinally, solve for $r_{\\mathrm{th}}$:\n$$r_{\\mathrm{th}} = 1 - \\frac{F_p - \\sigma_y A_c}{\\kappa L_j}$$\n\nThis is the closed-form expression for the minimal fractional reduction in adhesion required for the cell to ingress. The problem states the assumption that $0 < \\frac{F_p-\\sigma_y A_c}{\\kappa L_j} < 1$, which guarantees that the solution for $r_{\\mathrm{th}}$ lies strictly between $0$ and $1$, as is physically required for a non-trivial fractional reduction. The inequality $\\frac{F_p-\\sigma_y A_c}{\\kappa L_j} > 0$ implies that the protrusive force $F_p$ is greater than the force required to yield the membrane alone, $\\sigma_y A_c$, meaning some adhesion must be present to prevent premature ingression. The inequality $\\frac{F_p-\\sigma_y A_c}{\\kappa L_j} < 1$ implies that the protrusive force is not so large as to overcome the full adhesion force (at $c=1$) and the yield stress simultaneously from the start, requiring a partial, not total, reduction in adhesion.
