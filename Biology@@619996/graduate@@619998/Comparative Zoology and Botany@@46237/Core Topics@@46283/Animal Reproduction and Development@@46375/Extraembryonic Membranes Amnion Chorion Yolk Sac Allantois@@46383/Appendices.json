It contains no logical contradictions, missing information, or pseudoscientific elements. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing steady-state diffusion across a planar barrier is Fick's first law. The molar flux $J$, defined as the amount of substance transferred per unit area per unit time, is proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient. In the context of gas diffusion through a medium driven by a partial pressure gradient, this law can be expressed as:\n$$J = -K \\frac{dP}{dx}$$\nwhere $P$ is the partial pressure and $K$ is the permeability coefficient, which corresponds to the Krogh diffusion constant as defined in the problem. The units of the provided constant $K$ ($\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-1}\\,s^{-1}\\,kPa^{-1}}$) are consistent with this formulation.\n\nFor a planar membrane of uniform thickness $\\delta$ under steady-state conditions, the partial pressure gradient $\\frac{dP}{dx}$ can be approximated as a finite difference across the membrane:\n$$\\frac{dP}{dx} \\approx \\frac{P_{final} - P_{initial}}{\\delta} = -\\frac{P_{initial} - P_{final}}{\\delta} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{\\delta}$$\nwhere $\\Delta P$ is the partial pressure difference driving the diffusion.\n\nSubstituting this into the flux equation yields:\n$$J = -K \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta P}{\\delta}\\right) = K \\frac{\\Delta P}{\\delta}$$\nThis expression represents the molar flux, or the rate of oxygen transfer per unit area of the membrane. The problem asks for the total molar rate of oxygen transfer, which we denote as $\\dot{n}$. This is obtained by multiplying the flux $J$ by the total area of the membrane $A$:\n$$\\dot{n} = J \\cdot A$$\nTherefore, the derived expression for the total molar rate of oxygen transfer is:\n$$\\dot{n} = A K \\frac{\\Delta P}{\\delta}$$\nTo compute the numerical value, we must first ensure all parameters are in a consistent set of units.

Therefore, provided the amnion is effectively impermeable to sodium chloride (so that the van ’t Hoff factor is operative with reflection coefficient near unity) and water permeability is high, the net driving force strongly favors water movement into the amniotic cavity from the chorionic side.

For a simplified one-dimensional diffusion path, this is:\n$$ J = D \\frac{\\Delta C}{L} $$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient of oxygen within the membrane and $\\Delta C$ is the concentration difference of oxygen across it.\n\nThe concentration of a dissolved gas is related to its partial pressure via Henry's law: $C = \\sigma P$, where $\\sigma$ is the solubility coefficient.
