The concepts of phase durations, actomyosin ring constriction, and the relationship between rate, distance, and time are fundamental in cell biology and biophysics. The inverse proportionality between rate and tension ($r = k/T$) is a specific modeling assumption that, while perhaps counter-intuitive under some interpretations of \"tension,\" is a mathematically precise and physically plausible relationship (e.g., if tension represents stiffness or resistance to deformation). The problem does not violate fundamental scientific laws.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. All required data and relationships are explicitly stated. The objectives are clear, and a unique solution can be derived from the provided information.\n- **Objective**: The language is quantitative and precise, free from subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\nVerdict: The problem is deemed valid as it is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and unambiguously formulated. It is a straightforward application of defined principles.\n\nSolution Formulation\nThe problem requires the calculation of two distinct quantities. We will address each in turn.\n\nPart 1: Intrinsic Doubling Time\nThe intrinsic doubling time, $T_{double}$, is defined as the sum of the durations of the four cell cycle phases.\n$$T_{double} = t_{G1} + t_S + t_{G2} + t_M$$\nThe problem provides the durations for the $S$ phase and the $M$ phase, and the combined duration for the $G_1$ and $G_2$ phases. We can regroup the terms as follows:\n$$T_{double} = (t_{G1} + t_{G2}) + t_S + t_M$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n- $t_{G1} + t_{G2} = 1.5\\,\\text{h}$\n- $t_S = 2\\,\\text{h}$\n- $t_M = 0.5\\,\\text{h}$\n\nThe calculation is direct:\n$$T_{double} = 1.5 + 2 + 0.5 = 4.0\\,\\text{h}$$\nThe intrinsic doubling time of the ciliate is $4$ hours.\n\nPart 2: New Cytokinesis Duration\nThe duration of any process ($t$) covering a fixed distance ($d$) at a constant rate ($r$) is given by the relation $t = d/r$. In this case, $t_{cyto} = d/r_{constriction}$.\nThe problem states that the constriction rate $r$ is inversely proportional to the ring tension $T$, according to the formula:\n$$r = \\frac{k}{T}$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nSubstituting this expression for the rate into the duration equation gives the relationship between cytokinesis duration $t_{cyto}$ and tension $T$:\n$$t_{cyto} = \\frac{d}{r} = \\frac{d}{(k/T)} = \\frac{d \\cdot T}{k}$$\nSince both the distance $d$ and the constant $k$ are invariant, their ratio $d/k$ constitutes a new constant, let us call it $C$.\n$$t_{cyto} = C \\cdot T$$\nThis shows that the cytokinesis duration is directly proportional to the ring tension.\n\nWe can establish a ratio between the new state (subscript 'new') and the baseline state (subscript '$0$'):\n$$\\frac{t_{cyto, new}}{t_{cyto, 0}} = \\frac{C \\cdot T_{new}}{C \\cdot T_0} = \\frac{T_{new}}{T_0}$$\nThis allows us to find the new duration, $t_{cyto, new}$, without needing to know the values of $d$ or $k$:\n$$t_{cyto, new} = t_{cyto, 0} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{T_{new}}{T_0}\\right)$$\nThe problem states that the new tension, $T_{new}$, represents a $25\\%$ reduction from the baseline tension, $T_0$. Mathematically, this is:\n$$T_{new} = T_0 - 0.25 \\cdot T_0 = (1 - 0.25) \\cdot T_0 = 0.75 \\cdot T_0$$\nTherefore, the ratio of tensions is:\n$$\\frac{T_{new}}{T_0} = 0.75$$\nThe baseline duration of cytokinesis is given as $t_{cyto, 0} = 0.5\\,\\text{h}$. Substituting these values into the equation for the new duration:\n$$t_{cyto, new} = 0.5 \\cdot (0.75)$$\n$$t_{cyto, new} = 0.375\\,\\text{h}$$\nThe new cytokinesis duration after the reduction in tension is $0.375$ hours.\n\nThe final answer requires a row matrix containing the intrinsic doubling time and the new cytokinesis duration, in that order.

The problem is solvable under this necessary interpretation.\n    - The problem asks for a final numerical answer but gives the condition $\\mu_i / \\mu_a = 1$ only for a preceding \"order-of-magnitude estimate\". To avoid an underspecified problem, it is necessary to assume this condition carries forward to the final calculation. This is a reasonable inference given the problem's structure and the general statement that the time scales are of the same order.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in objective, scientific language, aside from the ambiguities noted above.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**, contingent on the reasonable interpretation of its ambiguous statements. A rigorous solution requires explicitly stating these interpretations. The solution process may proceed.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe problem demands a solution derived from fundamental principles and scaling arguments. We will proceed in stages as directed.\n\nFirst, we identify the intrinsic length scales of the system using dimensional analysis. Let $[L]$ denote the dimension of length and $[T]$ the dimension of time. The diffusion coefficients $D_a$ and $D_i$ have dimensions of $[L]^2 [T]^{-1}$, as dictated by Fick's law. The characteristic kinetic rates $\\mu_a$ and $\\mu_i$ have dimensions of $[T]^{-1}$. To construct a quantity with the dimension of length, $[L]$, from these parameters, we must combine them in a way that eliminates the time dimension.\nFor the activator, consider the ratio $D_a / \\mu_a$:\n$$ \\left[\\frac{D_a}{\\mu_a}\\right] = \\frac{[L]^2 [T]^{-1}}{[T]^{-1}} = [L]^2 $$\nTherefore, the quantity $\\ell_a = \\sqrt{D_a / \\mu_a}$ has dimensions of length. By identical reasoning, the quantity $\\ell_i = \\sqrt{D_i / \\mu_i}$ also has dimensions of length. These are the activator and inhibitor diffusion lengths, respectively. They represent the characteristic distance each substance diffuses during its characteristic kinetic lifetime. These are the only two length scales that can be constructed from the fundamental parameters ($D_a, D_i, \\mu_a, \\mu_i$) of the linearized problem.\n\nSecond, we are asked to provide a scaling argument for the characteristic bud spacing, $\\lambda$. In a Turing-type activator-inhibitor system, pattern formation arises from the interplay of short-range activation and long-range inhibition. An activator molecule, produced at a certain point, autocatalyzes its own production, leading to a local spike in concentration. This activator also stimulates the production of an inhibitor. The inhibitor, having a much larger diffusion coefficient ($D_i \\gg D_a$), spreads over a greater distance than the activator. The characteristic range of this inhibition is its diffusion length, $\\ell_i$. This diffusing inhibitor suppresses the formation of other activator peaks in its vicinity. The resulting periodic pattern of activator peaks (which correspond to incipient buds) will therefore have a characteristic spacing, $\\lambda$, determined by the range of the inhibitory field. Consequently, the most direct physical scaling argument is that the pattern wavelength must be proportional to the inhibitor diffusion length:\n$$ \\lambda \\propto \\ell_i $$\nThis can be written with a dimensionless proportionality constant $C$ as $\\lambda = C \\ell_i$. The problem asks to relate this to the activator diffusion length $\\ell_a$. Dividing by $\\ell_a$, we obtain the relationship for the dimensionless spacing $\\tilde{\\lambda} = \\lambda/\\ell_a$:\n$$ \\frac{\\lambda}{\\ell_a} = C \\frac{\\ell_i}{\\ell_a} $$\nThis matches the only viable interpretation of the problem's statement.\n\nThird, we are instructed to use specific assumptions for an estimate. The proportionality constant is taken to be $C = 1$, and the kinetic time scales are assumed equal, which implies their inverse rates are equal: $\\mu_a = \\mu_i$. Under these assumptions, the scaling relation becomes $\\lambda = \\ell_i$. To express this in the requested dimensionless form (in units of the activator diffusion length), we compute the ratio:\n$$ \\tilde{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\ell_a} = \\frac{\\ell_i}{\\ell_a} $$\nSubstituting the definitions of $\\ell_a$ and $\\ell_i$:\n$$ \\tilde{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\sqrt{D_i / \\mu_i}}{\\sqrt{D_a / \\mu_a}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D_i}{D_a} \\cdot \\frac{\\mu_a}{\\mu_i}} $$\nApplying the assumption $\\mu_i / \\mu_a = 1$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\tilde{\\lambda} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D_i}{D_a}} $$\n\nFinally, we must compute the exact value for this dimensionless spacing. We are given a nondimensionalization scheme that results in dimensionless diffusion coefficients which we denote with a tilde: $\\tilde{D}_a = 1$ and $\\tilde{D}_i = 10$. As established by the standard nondimensionalization procedure with length scale $\\ell_a = \\sqrt{D_a/\\mu_a}$ and time scale $\\mu_a^{-1}$, the dimensionless inhibitor diffusion coefficient is precisely the ratio of the physical coefficients: $\\tilde{D}_i = D_i / D_a$. Thus, we are given $D_i / D_a = 10$.\nAs noted during validation, to obtain a single numerical result, we must carry forward the assumption that $\\mu_i / \\mu_a = 1$. Substituting these values into our derived expression for the dimensionless spacing:\n$$ \\tilde{\\lambda} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D_i}{D_a} \\cdot \\frac{\\mu_a}{\\mu_i}} = \\sqrt{10 \\cdot 1} = \\sqrt{10} $$\nThe final answer is the characteristic bud spacing $\\lambda$ expressed in units of the activator diffusion length $\\ell_a$. This is by definition the dimensionless spacing $\\tilde{\\lambda}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\sqrt{10}} $$", "id": "2549946"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate ecological success of a reproductive strategy is measured by its effect on population growth.

The spectral radius is the maximum of these values.\n- For both temperatures $T_1=10.0$ and $T_2=20.0$, the bud survival probability is $s_B(T) = 0.9$.\n- The first eigenvalue is thus $\\lambda_1 = 0.6 \\times 0.9 = 0.54$.\n- The set of eigenvalues for both temperatures is $\\{0.54, 0.4, 0.9\\}$.\n- The spectral radius is $\\lambda_{\\max}(T) = \\max(0.54, 0.4, 0.9) = 0.9$.\n\nThe maximal growth rate is $0.9$ for both temperatures. Applying the tie-breaking rule, we select the smallest temperature.
