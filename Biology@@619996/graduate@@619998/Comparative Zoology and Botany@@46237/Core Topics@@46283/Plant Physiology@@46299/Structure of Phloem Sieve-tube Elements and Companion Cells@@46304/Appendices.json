The parameters given ($r = 0.40 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{m}$, $d = 1.5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{m}$) are physically plausible and consistent, as the pore diameter ($2r = 0.80 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{m}$) is less than the center-to-center spacing ($d = 1.5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{m}$), preventing overlap. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a unique solution. The presence of $A_{\\mathrm{plate}}$ is not contradictory; it allows for an alternative calculation path that, as will be shown, yields the same result for the intensive property of porosity, confirming the problem's consistency.\n\nStep 3: Verdict\nThe problem is deemed valid and a full solution will be provided.\n\nThe open-area fraction, or porosity $\\phi$, is defined as the ratio of the total open area (the sum of the areas of all pores) to the total area of the sieve plate.\n$$ \\phi = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{open}}}{A_{\\mathrm{total}}} $$\nFor a uniform, repeating lattice structure, the porosity is an intensive property and can be calculated by considering a single primitive unit cell of the lattice.\n$$ \\phi = \\frac{\\text{Area of pores within a unit cell}}{\\text{Area of the unit cell}} $$\nThe problem states that the pores are arranged in a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice. In such a lattice, each point is equidistant from its six neighbors. The centers of the pores form the vertices of a tessellation of equilateral triangles with side length $d$, the center-to-center pore spacing.\n\nThe most convenient primitive unit cell for a hexagonal lattice is a rhombus composed of two adjacent equilateral triangles. The side length of this rhombus is $d$. The area of an equilateral triangle with side $d$ is given by $A_{\\mathrm{triangle}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}d^2$. The area of the rhombic unit cell, $A_{\\mathrm{cell}}$, is therefore twice this value.\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{cell}} = 2 \\times A_{\\mathrm{triangle}} = 2 \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}d^2 \\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}d^2 $$\nThis area, $A_{\\mathrm{cell}}$, represents the total area associated with a single lattice point (a single pore). This is consistent with the problem's hint that the number density of lattice points is the inverse of the fundamental cell area.\n\nNext, we determine the area of the pores associated with this unit cell. The rhombic unit cell has a pore center at each of its four vertices. However, each vertex is shared by four adjacent unit cells in the lattice tessellation. Therefore, the total number of pores contained effectively within one unit cell is $N_{\\mathrm{pores/cell}} = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 1$.\n\nThe pores are circular with a radius $r$. The area of a single pore, $A_{\\mathrm{pore}}$, is:\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{pore}} = \\pi r^2 $$\nThe total open area within one unit cell, $A_{\\mathrm{open, cell}}$, is the number of pores per cell multiplied by the area of a single pore.\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{open, cell}} = N_{\\mathrm{pores/cell}} \\times A_{\\mathrm{pore}} = 1 \\times \\pi r^2 = \\pi r^2 $$\nNow, the porosity $\\phi$ can be derived by taking the ratio of the open area in the unit cell to the total area of the unit cell.\n$$ \\phi = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{open, cell}}}{A_{\\mathrm{cell}}} = \\frac{\\pi r^2}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}d^2} $$\nThis expression can be rearranged to provide the final symbolic form for the porosity in terms of $r$ and $d$:\n$$ \\phi = \\frac{2\\pi r^2}{\\sqrt{3}d^2} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}}\\left(\\frac{r}{d}\\right)^2 $$\nThis is the required expression. As a check, note that the maximum possible packing density for circles in a plane is for a hexagonal lattice where circles touch, meaning $d=2r$. Substituting this condition into our derived expression gives $\\phi_{\\max} = \\frac{2\\pi r^2}{\\sqrt{3}(2r)^2} = \\frac{2\\pi r^2}{4\\sqrt{3}r^2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 0.9069$, which is the correct, known theoretical maximum.\n\nNow we evaluate this expression using the given values: $r = 0.40 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{m}$ and $d = 1.5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{m}$.\n$$ \\phi = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}}\\left(\\frac{0.40}{1.5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}}\\left(\\frac{4}{15}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}}\\left(\\frac{16}{225}\\right) = \\frac{32\\pi}{225\\sqrt{3}} $$\nTo obtain the numerical value, we compute the expression:\n$$ \\phi \\approx \\frac{32 \\times 3.14159265...}{225 \\times 1.73205081...} \\approx \\frac{100.53096...}{389.71143...} \\approx 0.2579643... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\phi \\approx 0.2580 $$\nThe total plate area $A_{\\mathrm{plate}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}$ was not necessary for this calculation, as porosity is an intensive property. However, using it serves as a consistency check. The number of pores would be $N = A_{\\mathrm{plate}}/A_{\\mathrm{cell}} = (5.0 \\times 10^3) / (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(1.5)^2) \\approx 2566$. The total open area would be $A_{\\mathrm{open}} = N \\times A_{\\mathrm{pore}} \\approx 2566 \\times \\pi(0.40)^2 \\approx 1289.8 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{m}^2$. The porosity would be $\\phi = A_{\\mathrm{open}}/A_{\\mathrm{plate}} \\approx 1289.8 / (5.0 \\times 10^3) \\approx 0.2580$.
