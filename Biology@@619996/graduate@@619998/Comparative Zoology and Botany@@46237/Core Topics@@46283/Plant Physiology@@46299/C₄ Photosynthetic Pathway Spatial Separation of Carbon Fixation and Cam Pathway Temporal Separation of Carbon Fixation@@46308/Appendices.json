The equation $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}M}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k_d M(t)$ with the initial condition $M(0) = M_0$ is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. Its solution is an exponential decay function:\n$$M(t) = M_0 \\exp(-k_d t)$$\nThe instantaneous flux of $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ from decarboxylation, $J_{\\mathrm{dec}}(t)$, is given by $J_{\\mathrm{dec}}(t) = k_d M(t)$. Substituting the expression for $M(t)$ yields:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{dec}}(t) = k_d M_0 \\exp(-k_d t)$$\n\nNext, we find the time, $t^*$, at which stomata begin to open. This occurs when the decarboxylation flux $J_{\\mathrm{dec}}(t)$ drops to the threshold value $J^{\\*}$. We set $J_{\\mathrm{dec}}(t^*) = J^{\\*}$:\n$$k_d M_0 \\exp(-k_d t^*) = J^{\\*}$$\nTo solve for $t^*$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$\\exp(-k_d t^*) = \\frac{J^{\\*}}{k_d M_0}$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-k_d t^* = \\ln\\left(\\frac{J^{\\*}}{k_d M_0}\\right)$$\n$$t^* = -\\frac{1}{k_d} \\ln\\left(\\frac{J^{\\*}}{k_d M_0}\\right) = \\frac{1}{k_d} \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_d M_0}{J^{\\*}}\\right)$$\nWe must verify if $t^* < T_{\\mathrm{day}}$.

Since $7.675\\,\\mathrm{h} < 12.0\\,\\mathrm{h}$, the stomata do indeed open during the photoperiod.\n\nThe direct atmospheric $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ uptake during the day, denoted $U_{\\mathrm{day}}$, occurs at a constant rate $J_{\\mathrm{open}}$ for the time interval from $t^*$ to $T_{\\mathrm{day}}$. The duration of uptake is $\\Delta t = T_{\\mathrm{day}} - t^*$.\nThus, the total daytime uptake is:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{day}} = J_{\\mathrm{open}} \\times (T_{\\mathrm{day}} - t^*) = J_{\\mathrm{open}} \\left(T_{\\mathrm{day}} - \\frac{1}{k_d} \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_d M_0}{J^{\\*}}\\right)\\right)$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{day}} = 1.50\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\,m^{-2}\\,h^{-1}} \\times \\left(12.0\\,\\mathrm{h} - \\frac{\\ln(10)}{0.30}\\,\\mathrm{h}\\right) \\approx 1.50 \\times (12.0 - 7.67528) \\approx 6.48708\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\,m^{-2}}$$\n\nThe nocturnal atmospheric $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ uptake, denoted $U_{\\mathrm{night}}$, is given as being equal to the initial malate pool, $M_0$.\n$$U_{\\mathrm{night}} = M_0 = 200\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\,m^{-2}}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the proportion $p$, defined as the ratio of nocturnal uptake to total daily uptake:\n$$p = \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{night}}}{U_{\\mathrm{night}} + U_{\\mathrm{day}}} = \\frac{M_0}{M_0 + U_{\\mathrm{day}}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$p = \\frac{200}{200 + 6.48708} = \\frac{200}{206.48708} \\approx 0.968583$$\nRounding to four significant figures, as required by the problem statement, we obtain $p = 0.9686$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9686}$$", "id": "2552370"}, {"introduction": "The theoretical models of photosynthetic pathways find powerful application in the field of stable isotope biogeochemistry.
