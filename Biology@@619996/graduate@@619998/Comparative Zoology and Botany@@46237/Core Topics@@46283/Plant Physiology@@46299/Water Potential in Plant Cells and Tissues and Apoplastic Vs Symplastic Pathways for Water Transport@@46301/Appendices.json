It is scientifically grounded in the principles of physical chemistry and plant physiology, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. We shall proceed.\n\nThe solution is partitioned into three components as requested: derivation of the osmotic potential expression, numerical evaluation for the given conditions, and a qualitative discussion of non-ideal effects.\n\nFirst, we derive the dilute-solution expression for the osmotic (solute) potential, $\\Psi_s$. Water potential, $\\Psi_w$, is defined as the chemical potential of water, $\\mu_w$, relative to the chemical potential of pure water at reference pressure, $\\mu_w^o$, normalized by the partial molar volume of water, $\\bar{V}_w$.\n$$ \\Psi_w = \\frac{\\mu_w - \\mu_w^o}{\\bar{V}_w} $$\nConsider a system at thermodynamic equilibrium, where a solution is separated from pure water by a membrane permeable only to water. The pure water is at reference pressure $P_o$, and the solution is at pressure $P$, which is elevated by the osmotic pressure, $\\Pi$, such that $P = P_o + \\Pi$. At equilibrium, the chemical potential of water is uniform throughout the system:\n$$ \\mu_w(\\text{pure water at } P_o) = \\mu_w(\\text{solution at } P) $$\nBy definition, $\\mu_w(\\text{pure water at } P_o) = \\mu_w^o$. The chemical potential of water in the solution is given by:\n$$ \\mu_w(\\text{solution at } P) = \\mu_w^*(P) + RT \\ln(x_w) $$\nHere, $\\mu_w^*(P)$ is the chemical potential of pure water at pressure $P$, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $x_w$ is the mole fraction of water in the solution.\n\nThe pressure dependence of chemical potential is given by $(\\partial \\mu_w^*/\\partial P)_T = \\bar{V}_w$. Assuming water is an incompressible fluid, $\\bar{V}_w$ is constant. Integrating from $P_o$ to $P$ yields:\n$$ \\mu_w^*(P) - \\mu_w^*(P_o) = \\bar{V}_w(P - P_o) = \\bar{V}_w \\Pi $$\nSince $\\mu_w^*(P_o)$ is simply $\\mu_w^o$, we have $\\mu_w^*(P) = \\mu_w^o + \\bar{V}_w \\Pi$. Substituting this into the equilibrium condition:\n$$ \\mu_w^o = (\\mu_w^o + \\bar{V}_w \\Pi) + RT \\ln(x_w) $$\n$$ -\\bar{V}_w \\Pi = RT \\ln(x_w) $$\nThis expression relates osmotic pressure to the mole fraction of water. The osmotic potential, $\\Psi_s$, is the solute-dependent component of the total water potential. For a solution at the reference pressure $P_o$, the pressure potential $\\Psi_p = P - P_o = 0$, and thus $\\Psi_w = \\Psi_s$. The water potential is:\n$$ \\Psi_s = \\frac{\\mu_w(\\text{solution at } P_o) - \\mu_w^o}{\\bar{V}_w} = \\frac{(\\mu_w^o + RT \\ln(x_w)) - \\mu_w^o}{\\bar{V}_w} = \\frac{RT}{\\bar{V}_w} \\ln(x_w) $$\nNote that $\\Psi_s = -\\Pi$. The solute potential is inherently negative as $x_w < 1$ and thus $\\ln(x_w) < 0$.\n\nFor a dilute solution, we introduce approximations. The mole fraction of water is $x_w = 1 - x_{\\text{solutes}}$, where $x_{\\text{solutes}}$ is the total mole fraction of all solute particles. For a dilute solution, $x_{\\text{solutes}} \\ll 1$, and we can use the Taylor series expansion $\\ln(1 - z) \\approx -z$ for small $z$.\n$$ \\ln(x_w) = \\ln(1 - x_{\\text{solutes}}) \\approx -x_{\\text{solutes}} $$\nThe solute mole fraction is $x_{\\text{solutes}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{solutes}}}{n_w + n_{\\text{solutes}}} \\approx \\frac{n_{\\text{solutes}}}{n_w}$, where $n_{\\text{solutes}}$ and $n_w$ are the moles of solute particles and water, respectively.\nSubstituting these approximations gives:\n$$ \\Psi_s \\approx \\frac{RT}{\\bar{V}_w} \\left(-\\frac{n_{\\text{solutes}}}{n_w}\\right) = -RT \\left(\\frac{n_{\\text{solutes}}}{n_w \\bar{V}_w}\\right) $$\nThe term $n_w \\bar{V}_w$ is the total volume of the solvent, water. For a dilute aqueous solution, this volume is approximately equal to the total volume of the solution, $V$. The term $n_{\\text{solutes}}/V$ is the total molar concentration of all solute particles, $C_{\\text{solutes}}$.\n$$ \\Psi_s \\approx -RT C_{\\text{solutes}} $$\nFor an electrolyte with a stoichiometric concentration $c$, the concentration of solute particles is given by $C_{\\text{solutes}} = i \\cdot c$, where $i$ is the van 't Hoff factor, representing the number of independent particles formed per formula unit of the solute in solution. For a $1{:}1$ electrolyte such as potassium chloride ($\\text{KCl}$), ideal dissociation ($\\text{KCl} \\rightarrow \\text{K}^+ + \\text{Cl}^-$) yields two particles, so $i = 2$. Therefore, the desired expression is:\n$$ \\Psi_s = -i c R T $$\nThis is the van 't Hoff equation for osmotic potential.\n\nSecond, we evaluate $\\Psi_s$ for the given conditions.\nThe parameters are:\n-   Stoichiometric concentration, $c = 0.35$ mol L$^{-1}$\n-   van 't Hoff factor, $i = 2$\n-   Universal gas constant, $R = 0.008314$ MPa L mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$\n-   Absolute temperature, $T = 298.15$ K\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$ \\Psi_s = -(2) \\cdot (0.35 \\text{ mol L}^{-1}) \\cdot (0.008314 \\text{ MPa L mol}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}) \\cdot (298.15 \\text{ K}) $$\nThe calculation is executed as follows:\n$$ \\Psi_s = -(0.7) \\cdot (0.008314) \\cdot (298.15) \\text{ MPa} $$\n$$ \\Psi_s = -1.73516... \\text{ MPa} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we obtain:\n$$ \\Psi_s = -1.735 \\text{ MPa} $$\n\nThird, we discuss qualitatively the effect of short-range ion association. The ideal-dissociation model, which assumes $i=2$ for $\\text{KCl}$, neglects electrostatic interactions between ions. In a real solution, particularly at a non-negligible concentration of $0.35$ mol L$^{-1}$, oppositely charged ions ($\\text{K}^+$ and $\\text{Cl}^-$) attract one another and can form transient, non-covalent aggregates known as \"ion pairs\". An ion pair, such as $[\\text{K}^+\\text{Cl}^-]^0$, behaves osmotically as a single particle rather than two distinct ions.\n\nThis phenomenon reduces the total number of independent, osmotically active particles in the solution compared to the stoichiometric expectation. To account for this non-ideality within the dilute-solution framework, the ideal van 't Hoff factor $i$ is replaced by an effective, non-ideal parameter. This is most rigorously done using the osmotic coefficient, $\\phi$. The osmotic potential expression becomes:\n$$ \\Psi_s = -\\nu \\phi c R T $$\nwhere $\\nu$ is the number of ions per formula unit from stoichiometry (for $\\text{KCl}$, $\\nu=2$) and $\\phi$ is the osmotic coefficient, which is less than $1$ for a non-ideal solution with attractive inter-ionic forces. Alternatively, one can use an effective van 't Hoff factor, $i_{\\text{eff}} = \\nu \\phi$. Since $\\phi < 1$, it follows that $i_{\\text{eff}} < \\nu = 2$.\n\nThe consequence of ion pairing is that the actual magnitude of the osmotic potential, $|\\Psi_s|$, is less than the ideal calculated value. The solute potential becomes less negative (i.e., higher) than the $-1.735$ MPa computed under the ideal assumption.\n$$ |\\Psi_s|_{\\text{real}} = |-\\nu \\phi c R T| < |-\\nu c R T| = |\\Psi_s|_{\\text{ideal}} $$\nWater moves down a water potential gradient. The driving force for water to enter the cell symplast from the apoplast is $\\Delta\\Psi_w = \\Psi_{w, \\text{symplast}} - \\Psi_{w, \\text{apoplast}}$. The apoplastic water potential is dominated by the solute potential, $\\Psi_{w, \\text{apoplast}} \\approx \\Psi_s$. Because ion pairing makes $\\Psi_s$ less negative (a higher value), it raises the water potential of the apoplastic solution. This reduces the magnitude of the water potential gradient across the plasma membrane, $|\\Delta\\Psi_w|$. Consequently, ion pairing diminishes the thermodynamic driving force for water transport from the apoplast into the symplast. A lesser driving force for symplastic uptake implies that a greater proportion of water flow through the root tissue would proceed via the apoplastic pathway, bypassing the cell membranes.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-1.735} $$"}, {"introduction": "Having explored water potential at the cellular level, we now scale up to model water transport through the complex tissue architecture of a plant root.

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and a clear objective. The language is precise and objective, free of any factual unsoundness, contradiction, or ambiguity. The problem is a straightforward application of network analysis principles to a biophysical system and is therefore valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Solution**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe analysis is based on the analogy between hydraulic networks and direct current electrical circuits, where hydraulic conductance $G$ is analogous to electrical conductance, volumetric flow rate $J$ is analogous to current $I$, and water potential difference $\\Delta\\Psi$ is analogous to voltage drop $\\Delta V$. The governing law is $J = G\\,\\Delta\\Psi$.\n\nFirst, we determine the equivalent conductance of the cortex, which consists of three pathways in parallel. For hydraulic elements in parallel, the total flow is the sum of the individual flows, and the potential drop across each element is identical. Let the potential drop across the cortex be $\\Delta\\Psi_{c}$.\nThe total flow through the cortex, $J_{c}$, is the sum of the flows through the apoplastic ($J_{a}$), symplastic ($J_{s}$), and transmembrane ($J_{t}$) pathways:\n$$J_{c} = J_{a} + J_{s} + J_{t}$$\nUsing the governing law for each pathway, all under the same potential drop $\\Delta\\Psi_{c}$:\n$$J_{c} = G_{a}\\Delta\\Psi_{c} + G_{s}\\Delta\\Psi_{c} + G_{t}\\Delta\\Psi_{c} = (G_{a} + G_{s} + G_{t})\\Delta\\Psi_{c}$$\nThe equivalent conductance of the cortex, $G_{c}$, is defined by $J_{c} = G_{c}\\Delta\\Psi_{c}$. By comparison, it is evident that conductances in parallel add directly:\n$$G_{c} = G_{a} + G_{s} + G_{t}$$\n\nNext, this equivalent cortex network is in series with the endodermal barrier, which has conductance $G_{b}$. For elements in series, the flow through each element is the same (equal to the total flow, $J_{\\mathrm{tot}}$), and the total potential drop is the sum of the individual potential drops. Let the total potential drop across the entire root segment be $\\Delta\\Psi_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\n$$\\Delta\\Psi_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\Delta\\Psi_{c} + \\Delta\\Psi_{b}$$\nwhere $\\Delta\\Psi_{b}$ is the potential drop across the endodermal barrier.\nThe flow through each series component is $J_{\\mathrm{tot}}$:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{tot}} = G_{c}\\Delta\\Psi_{c} \\implies \\Delta\\Psi_{c} = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{G_{c}}$$\n$$J_{\\mathrm{tot}} = G_{b}\\Delta\\Psi_{b} \\implies \\Delta\\Psi_{b} = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{G_{b}}$$\nSubstituting these into the sum of potential drops:\n$$\\Delta\\Psi_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{G_{c}} + \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{G_{b}} = J_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\left( \\frac{1}{G_{c}} + \\frac{1}{G_{b}} \\right)$$\nThe overall equivalent conductance, $G_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, is defined by $J_{\\mathrm{tot}} = G_{\\mathrm{eq}}\\Delta\\Psi_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, which implies $\\Delta\\Psi_{\\mathrm{tot}} = J_{\\mathrm{tot}}/G_{\\mathrm{eq}}$. Therefore:\n$$\\frac{1}{G_{\\mathrm{eq}}} = \\frac{1}{G_{c}} + \\frac{1}{G_{b}}$$\nThis shows that for conductances in series, their reciprocals add. Substituting the expression for $G_{c}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{G_{\\mathrm{eq}}} = \\frac{1}{G_{a} + G_{s} + G_{t}} + \\frac{1}{G_{b}}$$\nSolving for $G_{\\mathrm{eq}}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{G_{\\mathrm{eq}}} = \\frac{G_{b} + (G_{a} + G_{s} + G_{t})}{G_{b}(G_{a} + G_{s} + G_{t})}$$\n$$G_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{G_{b}(G_{a} + G_{s} + G_{t})}{G_{a} + G_{s} + G_{t} + G_{b}}$$\nThis is the general expression for the equivalent conductance.\n\nNow, we derive the flow fractions through the parallel cortex pathways. The fraction of the total flow passing through pathway $i$ is $f_{i} = J_{i}/J_{\\mathrm{tot}}$. The flow through each individual cortex pathway is $J_{i} = G_{i}\\Delta\\Psi_{c}$, where $i \\in \\{a,s,t\\}$. The total flow through the system, $J_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, also passes through the cortex composite element, so $J_{\\mathrm{tot}} = G_{c}\\Delta\\Psi_{c}$.\nThe flow fraction for the apoplastic pathway, $f_{a}$, is:\n$$f_{a} = \\frac{J_{a}}{J_{\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{G_{a}\\Delta\\Psi_{c}}{G_{c}\\Delta\\Psi_{c}} = \\frac{G_{a}}{G_{c}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $G_{c}$:\n$$f_{a} = \\frac{G_{a}}{G_{a} + G_{s} + G_{t}}$$\nSimilarly, for the symplastic and transmembrane pathways:\n$$f_{s} = \\frac{G_{s}}{G_{a} + G_{s} + G_{t}}$$\n$$f_{t} = \\frac{G_{t}}{G_{a} + G_{s} + G_{t}}$$\nNote that the flow partitioning within the parallel block is independent of the series element $G_{b}$.\n\nFinally, we evaluate these expressions using the given numerical values: $G_{a} = 4$, $G_{s} = 3$, $G_{t} = 2$, and $G_{b} = 1$.\nThe equivalent conductance of the cortex is:\n$$G_{c} = G_{a} + G_{s} + G_{t} = 4 + 3 + 2 = 9$$\nThe total equivalent conductance of the root segment is:\n$$G_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{G_{b} \\cdot G_{c}}{G_{c} + G_{b}} = \\frac{1 \\cdot 9}{9 + 1} = \\frac{9}{10}$$\nThe flow fractions for the cortex pathways are:\n$$f_{a} = \\frac{G_{a}}{G_{c}} = \\frac{4}{9}$$\n$$f_{s} = \\frac{G_{s}}{G_{c}} = \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n$$f_{t} = \\frac{G_{t}}{G_{c}} = \\frac{2}{9}$$\nAs a consistency check, the sum of fractions is $f_{a} + f_{s} + f_{t} = \\frac{4}{9} + \\frac{3}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{9}{9} = 1$, which is correct.\n\nThe final answer is to be reported as the row vector $\\begin{pmatrix} G_{\\mathrm{eq}} & f_{a} & f_{s} & f_{t} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSubstituting the calculated values: $\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{9}{10} & \\frac{4}{9} & \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{2}{9} \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{9}{10} & \\frac{4}{9} & \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{2}{9} \\end{pmatrix}}$$"}]}
