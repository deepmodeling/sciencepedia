The adjacent xylem vessels contain nearly pure water, so their water potential is significantly higher (less negative) than the newly loaded sieve tube's water potential. As a result, water flows from the xylem into the sieve tube, following the water potential gradient.

We proceed with the solution.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Volumetric Flow Rate $Q$**\nWe begin with the Navier-Stokes equation for an incompressible fluid in cylindrical coordinates $(r', \\theta, z)$. For a steady $(\\partial/\\partial t = 0)$, axisymmetric $(\\partial/\\partial \\theta = 0, v_\\theta=0)$, and fully developed $(\\partial v_z/\\partial z = 0)$ flow, the velocity vector is $\\mathbf{v} = v_z(r')\\mathbf{\\hat{z}}$. The continuity equation $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0$ is satisfied, and the radial velocity $v_{r'}$ is zero everywhere. The momentum equation in the axial ($z$) direction simplifies considerably. The inertial terms are identically zero: $\\rho(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla)v_z = 0$. Assuming gravitational effects are negligible or absorbed into the pressure term, the balance is between the pressure gradient and viscous forces.\n\nThe $z$-component of the steady-state Navier-Stokes equation becomes:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial z} + \\eta \\left[ \\frac{1}{r'}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r'}\\left(r' \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial r'}\\right) + \\frac{1}{r'^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial \\theta^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial z^2} \\right] $$\nWith axisymmetry and fully developed flow, the equation further reduces to an ordinary differential equation, as $v_z$ is a function of $r'$ only:\n$$ \\frac{d P}{d z} = \\eta \\frac{1}{r'}\\frac{d}{d r'}\\left(r' \\frac{d v_z}{d r'}\\right) $$\nHere, $\\frac{d P}{d z}$ is a constant as given. We can now integrate this equation twice to find the velocity profile $v_z(r')$.\nRearranging and integrating with respect to $r'$:\n$$ r' \\frac{d}{d r'}\\left(r' \\frac{d v_z}{d r'}\\right) = \\frac{r'}{\\eta} \\frac{d P}{d z} $$\n$$ \\int d\\left(r' \\frac{d v_z}{d r'}\\right) = \\int \\frac{r'}{\\eta} \\frac{d P}{d z} dr' $$\n$$ r' \\frac{d v_z}{d r'} = \\frac{r'^2}{2\\eta} \\frac{d P}{d z} + C_1 $$\nTo determine the constant of integration $C_1$, we apply the boundary condition of finite velocity at the centerline ($r'=0$). Dividing by $r'$ gives $\\frac{d v_z}{d r'} = \\frac{r'}{2\\eta} \\frac{d P}{d z} + \\frac{C_1}{r'}$. The term $\\frac{C_1}{r'}$ would cause the velocity gradient to be infinite at $r'=0$ unless $C_1 = 0$. Thus, $C_1=0$.\n$$ \\frac{d v_z}{d r'} = \\frac{r'}{2\\eta} \\frac{d P}{d z} $$\nIntegrating a second time:\n$$ v_z(r') = \\int \\frac{r'}{2\\eta} \\frac{d P}{d z} dr' = \\frac{r'^2}{4\\eta} \\frac{d P}{d z} + C_2 $$\nTo find $C_2$, we apply the no-slip boundary condition at the wall, $v_z(r) = 0$, where $r$ is the tube radius.\n$$ 0 = \\frac{r^2}{4\\eta} \\frac{d P}{d z} + C_2 \\implies C_2 = -\\frac{r^2}{4\\eta} \\frac{d P}{d z} $$\nSubstituting $C_2$ back gives the parabolic velocity profile:\n$$ v_z(r') = \\frac{1}{4\\eta} \\frac{d P}{d z} (r'^2 - r^2) = -\\frac{1}{4\\eta} \\frac{d P}{d z} (r^2 - r'^2) $$\nThe volumetric flow rate $Q$ is obtained by integrating the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area of the tube.

The assumptions are:\n$1$. At the source (e.g., a leaf), active transport loads solutes (primarily sucrose) into sieve tube elements.\n$2$. This increase in solute concentration lowers the solute potential, and thus the total water potential, within the sieve tube.\n$3$. Water from adjacent xylem tissue, having a higher water potential, moves into the source-end sieve tube via osmosis.\n$4$. This influx of water generates a high hydrostatic pressure (turgor pressure) at the source.\n$5$. Conversely, at the sink (e.g., a root or fruit), solutes are unloaded from the sieve tube, either actively or passively.\n$6$. This removal of solutes raises the water potential inside the sink-end sieve tube, causing water to flow out via osmosis.\n$7$. This efflux of water results in a low hydrostatic pressure at the sink.\nThe difference between the high pressure at the source and the low pressure at the sink creates the pressure gradient along the length of the sieve tube, driving the bulk flow of sap.\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Calculation**\nFlow occurs from high pressure to low pressure. Thus, for flow in the positive $z$-direction, the pressure gradient $\\frac{d P}{d z}$ must be negative. The problem provides the magnitude of the gradient, which we define as $\\frac{\\Delta P}{L} = -\\frac{d P}{d z}$. Thus, a positive flow rate $Q$ is associated with a pressure drop in the direction of flow.\nThe formula becomes:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4}{8\\eta} \\left(\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}\\right) $$\nWe are given the following values:\n-   Pressure gradient magnitude, $\\frac{\\Delta P}{L} = 1.0 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$.\n-   Sieve tube radius, $r = 5.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n-   Dynamic viscosity, $\\eta = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi (5.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m})^4}{8 (2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s})} (1.0 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}) $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi (625 \\times 10^{-24}\\ \\mathrm{m}^4)}{16 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}} (1.0 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}) $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{625\\pi}{16} \\times 10^{(-24 - (-3) + 5)}\\ \\mathrm{m}^3\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ Q = 39.0625\\pi \\times 10^{-16}\\ \\mathrm{m}^3\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx 122.718\\ \\times 10^{-16}\\ \\mathrm{m}^3\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ Q \\approx 1.22718 \\times 10^{-14}\\ \\mathrm{m}^3\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in nanoliters per second ($\\text{nL s}^{-1}$).

Therefore, the total solute concentration in the apoplast doubles.\n$C_{apo,\\mathrm{inv}} = 2 \\times C_{apo,\\mathrm{no}} = 2 \\times 0.20 \\text{ mol L}^{-1} = 0.40 \\text{ mol L}^{-1}$.\nThe change in concentration is:\n$\\Delta C_{apo} = C_{apo,\\mathrm{inv}} - C_{apo,\\mathrm{no}} = 0.40 - 0.20 = 0.20 \\text{ mol L}^{-1}$.\nFor calculation, all units must be in the SI base system.\n$\\Delta C_{apo} = 0.20 \\text{ mol L}^{-1} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ L}}{1 \\text{ m}^3} = 200 \\text{ mol m}^{-3}$.\nThe other given values are:\n$L_p = 5.0 \\times 10^{-13} \\text{ m s}^{-1} \\text{ Pa}^{-1}$\n$A = 1.00 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ m}^2$\n$R \\approx 8.314 \\text{ J mol}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1} = 8.314 \\text{ Pa m}^3 \\text{ mol}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}$\n$T = 298 \\text{ K}$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived equation for $\\Delta J_v$:\n$$ \\Delta J_v = (5.0 \\times 10^{-13} \\text{ m s}^{-1} \\text{ Pa}^{-1}) \\times (1.00 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ m}^2) \\times (8.314 \\text{ Pa m}^3 \\text{ mol}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}) \\times (298 \\text{ K}) \\times (200 \\text{ mol m}^{-3}) $$\n$$ \\Delta J_v = (5.0 \\times 1.00 \\times 8.314 \\times 298 \\times 200) \\times 10^{-21} \\text{ m}^3 \\text{ s}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\Delta J_v \\approx 2.4777 \\times 10^6 \\times 10^{-21} \\text{ m}^3 \\text{ s}^{-1} = 2.4777 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}^3 \\text{ s}^{-1} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in picoliters per second (pL s$^{-1}$). The conversion is $1 \\text{ pL} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}^3$.\n$$ \\Delta J_v = 2.4777 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}^3 \\text{ s}^{-1} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ pL}}{10^{-15} \\text{ m}^3} = 2.4777 \\text{ pL s}^{-1} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as instructed gives:\n$$ \\Delta J_v = 2.478 \\text{ pL s}^{-1} $$\nThis positive value indicates that the action of invertase causes a net increase in water flux directed from the sieve element to the apoplast. Initially, water flowed into the sieve element; after hydrolysis, the osmotic gradient is sufficiently weakened so that the hydrostatic pressure gradient dominates, driving water out of the sieve element.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.478}$$", "id": "2596123"}]}
