However, these patterns are not simply abstract typologies; they are the physical outcomes of forces acting within the early embryo.

By deriving the stable spindle orientation, you will gain a deeper, mechanistic appreciation for how cellular architecture dictates developmental trajectories.", "problem": "A single-cell embryo undergoes its first cleavage. In animals, cleavage orientation is constrained by cytoskeletal geometry at the blastomere cortex and by yolk distribution. Many protostome lineages exhibit spiral cleavage, typically oblique to the animal–vegetal axis with a defined chirality, whereas many deuterostome lineages exhibit radial cleavage aligned to the animal–vegetal axis. Consider a simplified, biophysically grounded model for a spherical blastomere approximated by a circular cortex in the equatorial plane. A bipolar mitotic spindle is oriented by cortical pulling forces generated by astral microtubules and dynein, and its orientation is characterized by an angle $\\theta$ measured from the animal–vegetal axis (taken as $\\phi_{y} = 0$). Assume the following:\n\n1) The local cortical traction per unit arc length at polar angle $\\psi$ has a baseline isotropic magnitude and a small anisotropic second-harmonic component, consistent with a bipolar spindle’s even symmetry: for a cytoskeletal anisotropy aligned at angle $\\phi_{c}$ (set by actomyosin architecture and chirality cues), the traction density is $f_{c}(\\psi) = f_{c0}\\left[1 + \\alpha \\cos\\big(2(\\psi - \\phi_{c})\\big)\\right]$ with $0 < \\alpha \\ll 1$. For yolk-coupled anisotropy aligned at $\\phi_{y}$, write similarly $f_{y}(\\psi) = f_{y0}\\left[1 + \\beta \\cos\\big(2(\\psi - \\phi_{y})\\big)\\right]$ with $0 < \\beta \\ll 1$.\n\n2) Each cortical element at angle $\\psi$ exerts an orienting torque on the spindle that is proportional to the local traction amplitude multiplied by a geometric kernel that respects spindle bipolar symmetry. Modeling the astral anchoring energy as proportional to $\\cos^{2}(\\theta - \\psi)$, and using force–torque balance at the cortex, the leading-order torque per unit arc length scales as $\\sin\\big(2(\\theta - \\psi)\\big)$.\n\n3) The total torque about the cell center is the line integral over the cortex of the sum of cytoskeletal and yolk contributions, each weighted by its coupling coefficient. Denote the effective couplings $k_{c}$ and $k_{y}$, and the cell radius by $R$. Work to leading order in $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, keeping only terms that survive the angular average over $\\psi \\in [0,2\\pi)$.\n\nUsing only the above physical premises and the requirement of static equilibrium ($\\text{net torque} = 0$), derive from first principles the closed-form analytic expression for the stable equilibrium orientation $\\theta^{\\ast}$ in terms of the second-harmonic strengths and axes $\\{A,\\phi_{c}\\}$ and $\\{B,\\phi_{y}\\}$, where $A$ and $B$ are proportional to $k_{c} f_{c0}\\alpha R$ and $k_{y} f_{y0}\\beta R$, respectively.

You have access to a photoconvertible fluorescent protein whose emission spectrum can be inreversibly shifted from green to red by a focused violet light exposure of wavelength $405$ nanometers, expressed broadly after microinjection of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) at the zygote stage. You can image embryos by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and assess oral and anal epithelia by whole-mount in situ hybridization (WMISH) for canonical markers (for example, *FoxA* for oral or pharyngeal ectoderm and *Cdx* for hindgut and anal ectoderm). You can photoconvert at defined developmental times, including the onset of gastrulation (time $t_g$), the time of mouth opening (time $t_m$), and the time of anus opening (time $t_a$). Your goal is to rigorously test whether cells lining the blastopore at gastrulation contribute predominantly to the mouth in the lophotrochozoan and predominantly to the anus in the hemichordate.\n\nFoundational base you may invoke includes: the definition of a blastopore as the site of gastrulation opening; the operational meaning of fate mapping as labeling a cohort of cells at time $t_g$ and determining their descendants at later times $t_m$ and $t_a$; and the conventional distinction between protostomes and deuterostomes, in which blastopore-derived lineage contributions are predicted to favor the mouth in protostomes and the anus in deuterostomes, respectively.

The givens are sufficient and consistent. The problem is valid. We will now proceed to evaluate the proposed experimental designs.\n\nA rigorous fate-mapping experiment designed to test the stated hypothesis must adhere to several fundamental principles of experimental design:\n1.  **Spatial and Temporal Specificity**: The labeling of cells must be restricted precisely to the population of interest—the cells of the blastopore rim—and at the correct developmental stage, which is the onset of gastrulation ($t_g$).\n2.  **Unambiguous Lineage Tracing and Fate Identification**: The fate of the labeled cells must be determined without ambiguity. This requires a stable cell label (the photoconverted protein) and an independent, definitive method for identifying the resulting tissues of interest (the mouth and anus), for which molecular markers such as *FoxA* and *Cdx* are the appropriate standard.\n3.  **Inclusion of Proper Controls**: The experiment must include negative controls to account for artifacts. At minimum, a control for the specificity of labeling (e.g., labeling a non-blastoporal region) and a control for the effects of the experimental manipulation itself (e.g., sham-irradiated embryos to test for phototoxicity) are required.\n4.  **Quantitative Analysis**: Observations should be quantified to allow for objective comparison and statistical testing. Simply reporting the presence or absence of labeled cells is insufficient.\n5.  **Falsifiability**: The experimental predictions must be formulated such that the results can either support or refute the initial hypothesis.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option against these criteria.\n\n**Option A**: Inject photoconvertible protein mRNA and photoconvert the entire vegetal hemisphere at a cleavage stage well before gastrulation. Track red fluorescence at time $t_m$ and time $t_a$ and infer contributions by proximity to the original vegetal region, concluding that the blastopore contributes to the mouth in both taxa if red cells are seen near the oral field at time $t_m$.\n\nThis design is fundamentally flawed.\n- **Specificity**: Labeling the \"entire vegetal hemisphere\" at a \"cleavage stage\" is grossly imprecise. The blastopore as a structure does not yet exist, and this large labeled territory includes precursors to many tissues, not just the blastopore rim. The experiment therefore does not test the fate of the blastopore.\n- **Readout**: \"Inferring contributions by proximity\" is a vague, non-quantitative, and unreliable method. Cell migration during morphogenesis is complex; final proximity does not prove direct lineage. It also fails to use the provided molecular markers for rigorous tissue identification.\n- **Conclusion**: The proposed logic for drawing a conclusion is unsound. Given the large initial labeled area, finding labeled cells near the mouth is a highly probable but uninformative outcome.\n\n**Verdict**: Incorrect. This experimental design lacks the necessary precision and rigor, and would not yield interpretable data to test the hypothesis.\n\n**Option B**: Inject photoconvertible protein mRNA to achieve broad expression by time $t_g$. At time $t_g$, photoconvert a narrow continuous ring of cells precisely at the blastopore rim in each embryo using a scanned $405$ nanometer beam, leaving neighboring ectoderm unconverted. Include negative controls by photoconverting a non-rim ectodermal patch at the same stage and sham-irradiated siblings.

Treat mixed or inverted outcomes as evidence against the respective conventional expectation.\n\nThis design is exemplary and meets all criteria for a rigorous experiment.\n- **Specificity**: Labeling is performed on a \"narrow continuous ring of cells precisely at the blastopore rim\" at the correct time, $t_g$. This is the exact cell population and stage of interest.\n- **Controls**: It correctly includes two essential controls: a negative control for labeling specificity (\"non-rim ectodermal patch\") and a sham control for phototoxicity and handling artifacts (\"sham-irradiated siblings\").\n- **Readout**: It employs the correct method for fate identification: co-localization of the lineage tracer (red fluorescence) with definitive molecular markers (*FoxA* for mouth and *Cdx* for anus).\n- **Quantification**: It proposes a quantitative approach by calculating indices ($I_{\\text{mouth}}$ and $I_{\\text{anus}}$) to measure the contribution of the labeled cells to the final structures. This allows for objective comparison.\n- **Falsifiability**: It makes clear, falsifiable predictions based on the conventional protostome/deuterostome models and correctly interprets contradictory results as evidence against those models.\n- **Additional Rigor**: The proposal to perform a time-shifted experiment demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of developmental dynamics.\n\n**Verdict**: Correct. This option describes a scientifically rigorous, well-controlled, and quantitative experiment capable of definitively testing the stated hypothesis.\n\n**Option C**: At a late larval stage after mouth formation is evident, photoconvert cells in the stomodeal invagination region and track whether these cells are found near the blastopore scar in fixed specimens; infer blastopore fate from this relationship without additional markers.\n\nThis design is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of fate mapping.\n- **Principle**: Fate mapping is a prospective (forward-in-time) analysis, used to determine what a group of cells will become. This option proposes a retrospective (backward-in-time) analysis, labeling cells in a developed structure (the mouth) and attempting to infer their origin. A photoconversion label is static; it cannot be used to trace a cell’s history backward.\n- **Timing and Readout**: Labeling occurs \"after mouth formation is evident,\" which is too late to map the fate of the blastopore. Relying on a \"blastopore scar\" is unreliable, and the explicit omission of molecular markers removes any hope of rigor.\n\n**Verdict**: Incorrect. The proposed method is conceptually invalid for a fate-mapping experiment.\n\n**Option D**: At time $t_g$, photoconvert only the center of the blastopore (not the rim) in both species. Do not use molecular markers; instead, rely on serial CLSM images to see whether any red cells are visible in the mouth. If red cells are not seen in the mouth at time $t_m$, conclude that both taxa are deuterostomes, and omit controls to avoid phototoxicity confounds because photoconversion is brief.\n\nThis design is a catalogue of poor scientific practices.\n- **Specificity**: Labeling the \"center of the blastopore\" targets the involuting endomesoderm, not the blastopore rim cells that are central to the protostomy/deuterostomy question regarding ectodermal openings.\n- **Controls**: The explicit decision to \"omit controls\" is an unforgivable violation of the scientific method. The justification provided—that brief exposure avoids phototoxicity—is a mere assumption that must itself be tested. Without controls, any result is uninterpretable. A negative result (no red cells) could be due to cell death, not developmental fate.\n- **Readout**: The refusal to use molecular markers in favor of purely morphological identification is a step backward in terms of precision and objectivity.\n- **Logic**: The conclusion that \"if red cells are not seen in the mouth..., conclude that both taxa are deuterostomes\" is a logical fallacy (an argument from ignorance). The absence of cells in the mouth does not prove they contributed to the anus; they could have died or contributed to other tissues entirely.\n\n**Verdict**: Incorrect.

Your task is twofold: first, to outline a scientifically sound, maximum-likelihood pipeline for testing the bilaterian split with the outgroup used for rooting; and second, to derive from first principles an algorithm that computes the expected nonparametric bootstrap support for the bilaterian split as a function of per-site entropy $H$ and total sequence length $L$ under a simplified, explicitly stated statistical model.\n\nFoundational base you must use:\n- Maximum Likelihood (ML) infers the phylogenetic tree by maximizing the likelihood of observing the data under a substitution model and tree, and nonparametric bootstrap support equals the frequency with which an inferred split appears in bootstrap-resampled datasets.\n- The bootstrap resamples sites with replacement; under site independence, the number of sites favoring a hypothesis follows a binomial distribution with appropriate success probability.\n- Shannon entropy $H$ of a site pattern (computed with the natural logarithm) quantifies state uncertainty. For an alphabet of size $q$, the maximum entropy is $H_{\\max} = \\ln(q)$. Assume sites are independent and identically distributed across the concatenated alignment.\n- To close the model, assume a monotonic link between entropy and per-site probability of favoring the true bilaterian split. Let the per-site probability that a site supports the true bilaterian split be\n$$\np(H) = \\tfrac{1}{2} + \\alpha \\left(1 - \\frac{H}{H_{\\max}}\\right)\n$$\nwith an efficiency parameter $0 \\le \\alpha \\le \\tfrac{1}{2}$ that captures how effectively reduced entropy translates into phylogenetic signal under the chosen substitution model and taxon sampling. This expresses the no-systematic-bias assumption: at $H = H_{\\max}$, sites are uninformative with $p(H) = \\tfrac{1}{2}$; at $H \\approx 0$, the support probability increases toward $\\tfrac{1}{2} + \\alpha$.\n\nProblem requirements:\n1. Outline an ML-based pipeline, using the outgroup for rooting, starting from the $200$-gene concatenated alignment to test the bilaterian split. Your outline should be principle-based and independent of specific software names.\n2. From the foundational base above, derive an expression for the expected bootstrap support for the bilaterian split as a function of $H$, $L$, $q$, and $\\alpha$. Model bootstrap replicates as resampling $L$ sites with replacement, and let the bootstrap support be the probability that the split attains a strict majority in a replicate.\n3. Implement a program that computes the expected bootstrap support for the following test suite of parameters, each given as a tuple $(H, L, q, \\alpha)$:\n   - Case A: $(H = 1.5, L = 10000, q = 20, \\alpha = 0.3)$\n   - Case B: $(H = 0.0, L = 1000, q = 20, \\alpha = 0.5)$\n   - Case C: $(H = \\ln(20), L = 1000, q = 20, \\alpha = 0.5)$\n   - Case D: $(H = 2.0, L = 50, q = 20, \\alpha = 0.4)$\n   - Case E: $(H = 1.0, L = 500, q = 4, \\alpha = 0.25)$\n4. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., \"[result1,result2,result3,result4,result5]\"). Each result must be a floating-point number rounded to six decimal places. No other output is permitted.\n\nNotes and constraints:\n- Treat $H$ as measured in natural units (nats), so $H_{\\max} = \\ln(q)$.\n- Interpret $L$ as the total number of aligned sites in the concatenated matrix across the $200$ orthologs.\n- Angles are not involved. There are no physical units to report.\n- Ensure scientific realism by clearly stating any additional assumptions you introduce and by deriving the computational form from the foundational base. Do not use any external data or files.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on established principles of molecular phylogenetics and statistical modeling, providing all necessary information for a complete and unique solution. Therefore, it is valid. I will proceed with the solution, which consists of two parts: a conceptual outline of the phylogenetic pipeline and a mathematical derivation followed by its computational implementation.\n\nThe first task is to outline a maximum-likelihood pipeline for testing the bilaterian split hypothesis (monophyly of Protostomia and Deuterostomia). The provided data is a concatenated alignment of $200$ orthologous genes and a specified outgroup taxon.\n\n1.  **Data Curation and Multiple Sequence Alignment**: For each of the $200$ orthologous genes, the corresponding sequences (either protein or nucleotide) for all taxa—including protostomes, deuterostomes, and the designated outgroup—are retrieved. Each gene set is individually subjected to multiple sequence alignment. This step is of paramount importance as it establishes the positional homology across sequences, which is the basis for phylogenetic inference. The resulting alignments must be critically inspected, and poorly aligned or highly divergent regions should be removed using alignment trimming software or manual curation to reduce phylogenetic noise.\n\n2.  **Model Selection**: Before phylogenetic inference, one must select an appropriate mathematical model of sequence evolution for the data. This is typically done using statistical criteria like the Akaike Information Criterion ($AIC$) or the Bayesian Information Criterion ($BIC$). Given the composite nature of the dataset (concatenation of $200$ genes), a partitioned analysis is superior. The alignment is divided into partitions (e.g., one partition per gene, or partitions based on codon positions), and the best-fitting model is determined for each partition independently. This allows the model to account for the heterogeneous evolutionary dynamics across different parts of the genome. For protein sequences, candidate models include empirical matrices like $LG$, $WAG$, or $JTT$, often combined with parameters for rate heterogeneity across sites (a $\\Gamma$ distribution) and a proportion of invariant sites ($I$).\n\n3.  **Concatenation and Supermatrix Construction**: The individual, curated gene alignments are concatenated head-to-tail to form a single large data matrix, or \"supermatrix\". The total length of this alignment is the given parameter $L$. The partitioning scheme defined in the previous step is applied to this supermatrix.\n\n4.  **Maximum Likelihood Phylogenetic Inference**: Using the partitioned supermatrix, the goal is to find the phylogenetic tree topology ($\\mathcal{T}$) and associated branch lengths ($\\mathbf{b}$) that maximize the likelihood of observing the sequence data ($D$) given the evolutionary model ($M$). This is expressed as maximizing the likelihood function $L(\\mathcal{T}, \\mathbf{b} | D, M)$. As an exhaustive search of all possible tree topologies is computationally intractable for a typical number of taxa, heuristic search algorithms (e.g., those employing nearest-neighbor interchanges or subtree pruning and regrafting) are used to explore the tree space and find the tree with the maximum likelihood score.\n\n5.  **Tree Rooting**: The tree inferred from the maximum likelihood analysis is unrooted. To establish the temporal direction of evolution and test the hypothesis of a primary bilaterian split, the tree must be rooted. This is achieved using the specified outgroup taxon. The root of the tree is placed on the branch that connects the outgroup to the ingroup (all the bilaterian taxa). A correctly rooted tree will show the earliest divergence among the taxa in the analysis.\n\n6.  **Hypothesis Evaluation and Nonparametric Bootstrapping**: The optimal rooted ML tree is examined. If all protostome taxa form a monophyletic group and all deuterostome taxa form another monophyletic group, and these two clades are sister to each other, the tree topology supports the bilaterian split hypothesis. To assess the statistical confidence in this topology, and specifically in the node defining the split, nonparametric bootstrapping is performed. This procedure involves generating hundreds or thousands of replicate datasets by resampling the columns (sites) of the original supermatrix with replacement. An ML tree is inferred for each bootstrap replicate. The bootstrap support for any given clade (or split) is the frequency, expressed as a percentage, with which that clade appears in the resulting collection of bootstrap trees. High support (e.g., $95\\%$) for the clades corresponding to Protostomia, Deuterostomia, and their sister relationship (Bilateria) would constitute strong statistical evidence from the data.\n\nThe second task is to derive an expression for the expected bootstrap support for the bilaterian split as a function of per-site entropy $H$, total sequence length $L$, alphabet size $q$, and an efficiency parameter $\\alpha$.\n\nThe foundational model links the per-site probability of supporting the true bilaterian split, denoted $p$, to the per-site Shannon entropy $H$. This probability is given as:\n$$\np \\equiv p(H) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\alpha \\left(1 - \\frac{H}{H_{\\max}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $H_{\\max} = \\ln(q)$ is the maximum possible entropy for an alphabet of size $q$. The parameters are the entropy $H$, the sequence length $L$, the alphabet size $q$, and the efficiency coefficient $\\alpha \\in [0, 1/2]$.\n\nA bootstrap replicate is a dataset of size $L$ created by sampling sites with replacement from the original alignment. We assume that all sites in the original alignment are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Each time a site is drawn for the bootstrap sample, it has a probability $p$ of being a site that \"favors\" the true bilaterian split. This constitutes a Bernoulli trial with success probability $p$.\n\nLet $K$ be the random variable representing the number of sites that favor the true split in a single bootstrap replicate of length $L$. Since the replicate consists of $L$ independent Bernoulli trials, $K$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $L$ and $p$:\n$$\nK \\sim \\text{Binomial}(L, p)\n$$\nThe probability mass function (PMF) for this distribution is:\n$$\nP(K=k) = \\binom{L}{k} p^k (1-p)^{L-k}, \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, L\\}\n$$\nThe problem defines the bootstrap support as the probability that the true split \"attains a strict majority\" in a replicate. A strict majority requires the number of supporting sites $K$ to be greater than half the total length $L$. This is the event $K > L/2$.\n\nThe expected bootstrap support, $BS_{exp}$, is the probability of this event occurring in a randomly generated bootstrap replicate.\n$$\nBS_{exp} = P\\left(K > \\frac{L}{2}\\right)\n$$\nTo compute this probability, we must sum the probabilities of all integer outcomes $k$ that are strictly greater than $L/2$. This corresponds to summing from $k = \\lfloor L/2 \\rfloor + 1$ up to $L$.\n$$\nBS_{exp} = \\sum_{k=\\lfloor L/2 \\rfloor + 1}^{L} P(K=k)\n$$\nSubstituting the binomial PMF, the derived expression is:\n$$\nBS_{exp}(H, L, q, \\alpha) = \\sum_{k=\\lfloor L/2 \\rfloor + 1}^{L} \\binom{L}{k} \\left[\\frac{1}{2} + \\alpha \\left(1 - \\frac{H}{\\ln(q)}\\right)\\right]^k \\left[\\frac{1}{2} - \\alpha \\left(1 - \\frac{H}{\\ln(q)}\\right)\\right]^{L-k}\n$$\nThis expression is the survival function (SF) of the binomial distribution, which calculates $P(K > k_{threshold})$. In our case, the threshold is $L/2$. Thus, the expected bootstrap support can be calculated as $1 - F_K(\\lfloor L/2 \\rfloor; L, p)$, where $F_K$ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the binomial distribution, or more directly using a computational library function for the survival function evaluated at the threshold $L/2$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import binom\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the expected nonparametric bootstrap support for the bilaterian split\n    based on a simplified statistical model.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case is a tuple: (H, L, q, alpha)\n    # H: per-site entropy (nats)\n    # L: total sequence length\n    # q: alphabet size\n    # alpha: efficiency parameter\n    test_cases = [\n        (1.5, 10000, 20, 0.3),  # Case A\n        (0.0, 1000, 20, 0.5),   # Case B\n        (np.log(20), 1000, 20, 0.5), # Case C\n        (2.0, 50, 20, 0.4),    # Case D\n        (1.0, 500, 4, 0.25),   # Case E\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        H, L, q, alpha = case\n        \n        # Calculate maximum entropy H_max = ln(q)\n        # The natural logarithm is used as specified.\n        H_max = np.log(q)\n        \n        # The problem implies 0 = H = H_max, but the formula is robust.\n        # If H  H_max, p  0.5, representing systematic bias, which is a valid extension of the model.\n        # No test cases violate this, but the code would handle it.\n        \n        # Calculate the per-site probability 'p' of supporting the true split\n        # p(H) = 1/2 + alpha * (1 - H/H_max)\n        if H_max == 0: # Avoid division by zero if q=1\n            # If q=1, H must be 0, H/H_max is undefined.
