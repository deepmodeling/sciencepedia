The model uses standard principles of biophysical chemistry and electrophysiology. It is therefore valid, and we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is solved in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the expected macroscopic current $I$.\nLet the state of the $k$-th channel, for $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$, be described by a Bernoulli random variable $X_k$. We define $X_k=1$ if the channel is open and $X_k=0$ if the channel is closed. The problem states that the probability of any given channel being in the open state is $p_{\\text{open}}$. Thus, we have the probabilities $P(X_k=1) = p_{\\text{open}}$ and $P(X_k=0) = 1-p_{\\text{open}}$.\nThe electrical current contributed by a single channel, $I_k$, depends on its state. When open ($X_k=1$), it passes a current of magnitude $i$. When closed ($X_k=0$), it passes zero current. This can be written as $I_k = i X_k$.\nThe total macroscopic current, which we denote as $I_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the currents from all $N$ channels. Since the channels are stated to be independent, the total current is simply the sum of individual currents:\n$$I_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} I_k = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} i X_k$$\nThe problem asks for the expected macroscopic current, denoted by $I$, which is the mathematical expectation of $I_{\\text{total}}$. Using the linearity of the expectation operator:\n$$I = E[I_{\\text{total}}] = E\\left[\\sum_{k=1}^{N} i X_k\\right] = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} E[i X_k]$$\nSince the single-channel current magnitude $i$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the expectation:\n$$I = i \\sum_{k=1}^{N} E[X_k]$$\nThe expectation of the Bernoulli variable $X_k$ is given by $E[X_k] = 1 \\cdot P(X_k=1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_k=0) = p_{\\text{open}}$. As all channels are identical, this expectation is the same for all $k$. Substituting this result into the expression for $I$:\n$$I = i \\sum_{k=1}^{N} p_{\\text{open}} = i (N \\cdot p_{\\text{open}})$$\nThus, the expression for the expected macroscopic inward current is:\n$$I = N i p_{\\text{open}}$$\n\nPart 2: Re-expression of $p_{\\text{open}}(T)$.\nThe midpoint temperature $T^{\\ast}$ is defined as the temperature at which the Gibbs free energy difference between the open and closed states is zero, i.e., $\\Delta G(T^{\\ast})=0$. The Gibbs free energy difference is given by $\\Delta G(T) = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S$. At $T=T^{\\ast}$, we have:\n$$\\Delta H - T^{\\ast}\\Delta S = 0$$\nSolving for the molar entropy difference $\\Delta S$ gives:\n$$\\Delta S = \\frac{\\Delta H}{T^{\\ast}}$$\nNext, we substitute this expression for $\\Delta S$ back into the general equation for $\\Delta G(T)$:\n$$\\Delta G(T) = \\Delta H - T \\left(\\frac{\\Delta H}{T^{\\ast}}\\right) = \\Delta H \\left(1 - \\frac{T}{T^{\\ast}}\\right) = \\Delta H \\frac{T^{\\ast}-T}{T^{\\ast}}$$\nNow we substitute this new expression for $\\Delta G(T)$ into the given formula for the open probability $p_{\\text{open}}(T)$:\n$$p_{\\text{open}}(T) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\dfrac{\\Delta G(T)}{R T}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\dfrac{\\Delta H}{R T} \\dfrac{T^{\\ast}-T}{T^{\\ast}}\\right)}$$\nThis is the required expression for $p_{\\text{open}}(T)$ in terms of $\\Delta H$, $T^{\\ast}$, $R$, and $T$.\n\nPart 3: Numerical computation of the current $I$.\nWe use the expression $I = N i p_{\\text{open}}(T)$ and substitute the given parameter values. All parameters must be in consistent SI units for calculation.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of channels, $N$:\nThe channel density is $\\rho = 300\\,\\mu\\text{m}^{-2}$ and the area is $A = 150\\,\\mu\\text{m}^2$.\n$$N = \\rho A = (300) \\cdot (150) = 45000$$\n\nSecond, we calculate the single-channel current magnitude, $i$:\nThe single-channel conductance is $g_s = 20\\,\\text{pS} = 20 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{S}$.\nThe membrane potential is $V_m = -40\\,\\text{mV} = -40 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{V}$.\nThe reversal potential is $E_{\\text{rev}} = 0\\,\\text{mV} = 0\\,\\text{V}$.\n$$i = g_s |V_m - E_{\\text{rev}}| = (20 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{S}) \\cdot |-40 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{V} - 0\\,\\text{V}| = (20 \\times 10^{-12}) \\cdot (40 \\times 10^{-3})\\,\\text{A} = 800 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{A} = 8 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\text{A}$$\n\nThird, we calculate the open probability $p_{\\text{open}}(T)$ at the specified temperature.\nThe temperature is $T = T^{\\ast} + \\Delta T = 306\\,\\text{K} + 0.3\\,\\text{K} = 306.3\\,\\text{K}$.\nWe evaluate the argument of the exponential, which we will call $x$:\n$$x = \\frac{\\Delta H (T^{\\ast} - T)}{R T T^{\\ast}}$$\nThe parameters are $\\Delta H = 85\\,\\text{kJ/mol} = 85000\\,\\text{J/mol}$, $R = 8.314\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$, $T = 306.3\\,\\text{K}$, and $T^{\\ast} = 306\\,\\text{K}$.

I will first derive the general form of the posterior distribution and then apply it to the specific test cases provided.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the application of Bayes' rule for information fusion. Given a prior belief about the prey's location and two independent sensory measurements, the posterior probability distribution for the azimuth $x$ is proportional to the product of the prior and the likelihoods of the measurements:\n$$\np(x \\mid z_v, z_t) \\propto p(x) \\, p(z_v \\mid x) \\, p(z_t \\mid x)\n$$\nwhere $z_v$ is the visual measurement and $z_t$ is the thermal measurement.\n\nThe problem specifies Gaussian models for each component:\n1.  Prior distribution: $p(x) = \\mathcal{N}(x; \\mu_{0}, \\sigma_{0}^{2})$, representing the animal's initial belief about the azimuth $x$. Its probability density function is proportional to $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - \\mu_{0})^2}{2\\sigma_{0}^2}\\right)$.\n2.

Its density is proportional to $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - z_v)^2}{2\\sigma_v^2}\\right)$.\n3.  Thermal likelihood: Similarly, the thermal measurement $z_t$ is modeled as $z_t = x + \\eta_t$ with noise $\\eta_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_t^2)$.

By completing the square for $x$, we find the posterior precision $J_{\\mathrm{post}} = 1/\\sigma_{\\mathrm{post}}^2$ is the sum of the individual precisions:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{post}} = J_0 + J_v + J_t = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_0^2} + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_v^2} + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_t^2}\n$$\nFrom this, the posterior variance is $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{post}}^2 = J_{\\mathrm{post}}^{-1} = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma_0^2} + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_v^2} + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_t^2}\\right)^{-1}$.\nThe posterior mean, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{post}}$, is the precision-weighted average of the means of the component distributions:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{post}} = \\frac{J_0 \\mu_0 + J_v z_v + J_t z_t}{J_{\\mathrm{post}}} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{post}}^2 \\left(\\frac{\\mu_0}{\\sigma_0^2} + \\frac{z_v}{\\sigma_v^2} + \\frac{z_t}{\\sigma_t^2}\\right)\n$$\nThese formulas define the parameters of the fused posterior estimate.\n\nThe thermal noise standard deviation, $\\sigma_t$, is not given directly but depends on range $r$ and temperature contrast $\\Delta T$ according to the provided physical model:\n$$\n\\sigma_t = \\sigma_{t,\\mathrm{ref}} \\left(\\frac{r}{r_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{\\Delta T}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the provided constants $\\sigma_{t,\\mathrm{ref}} = 4$ degrees, $r_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 0.5$ meters, and $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 10$ degrees Celsius, we obtain a simplified working formula for $\\sigma_t$:\n$$\n\\sigma_t = 4 \\left(\\frac{r}{0.5}\\right) \\left(\\frac{10}{\\Delta T}\\right) = \\frac{80r}{\\Delta T}\n$$\n\nFinally, we must compute the posterior probability that the prey lies within a window of half-width $w=5$ degrees around the midline, $P(|x| \\le w \\mid z_v, z_t)$.

Calculate the probability $P(|x| \\le 5)$ using the CDF of the normal distribution with mean $\\mu_{\\mathrm{post}}$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{post}}$.\n6.  Report the results $(\\mu_{\\mathrm{post}}, \\sigma_{\\mathrm{post}}, P)$ rounded to $6$ decimal places.\nThis rigorous, step-by-step procedure based on foundational principles of Bayesian inference will be implemented to solve the problem.", "answer": "[[10.317460,1.781742,0.001422],[-5.004700,1.493910,0.498748],[-1.145833,1.658312,0.989989],[0.040984,4.958043,0.686580],[2.885060,3.922230,0.683030]]", "id": "2620053"}]}
