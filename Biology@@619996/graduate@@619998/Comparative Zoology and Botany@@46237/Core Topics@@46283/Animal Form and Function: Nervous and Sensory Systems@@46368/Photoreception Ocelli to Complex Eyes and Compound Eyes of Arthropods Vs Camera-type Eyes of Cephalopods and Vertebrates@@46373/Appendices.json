This practice explores the fundamental biophysics of vertebrate phototransduction, where the absorption of light leads to a change in membrane potential. By applying a core principle of electrophysiology, a version of Ohm's Law, you will quantify the hyperpolarizing response of a rod cell, a hallmark that distinguishes vertebrate ciliary photoreceptors from the depolarizing rhabdomeric photoreceptors of many arthropods [@problem_id:2596532]. This calculation provides a tangible link between ion channel activity and the initial electrical signal that underpins all of vision.", "problem": "In comparative photoreception, arthropod rhabdomeric photoreceptors in compound eyes typically depolarize to light due to channel openings, whereas vertebrate ciliary photoreceptors in camera-type eyes hyperpolarize to light due to channel closures. Consider a vertebrate rod photoreceptor in darkness held near an intracellular potential of $-40\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ by a steady inward “dark current” carried through Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated (CNG) channels. Upon a steady light step, CNG channels close so that the inward current is reduced by $20\\ \\mathrm{pA}$. Assume that over this operating range the cell behaves as a passive element with a constant input resistance and that steady-state changes obey the definition of input resistance.\n\nStarting from the definition of input resistance as the ratio of steady-state change in membrane potential to the change in membrane current, and using the intracellular potential convention $V_{m} = V_{\\mathrm{in}} - V_{\\mathrm{out}}$ with inward current defined as positive (positive charge entering the cell), determine the change in membrane potential $\\Delta V_{m}$ for an input resistance of $200\\ \\mathrm{M}\\Omega$. Express your final answer for $\\Delta V_{m}$ in $\\mathrm{mV}$ and round to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the change in membrane potential, $\\Delta V_{m}$, for a vertebrate rod photoreceptor upon exposure to light. The solution must be derived from the stated definition of input resistance and adhere to the given sign conventions.\n\nThe problem states that input resistance, $R_{in}$, is defined as the ratio of the steady-state change in membrane potential, $\\Delta V_{m}$, to the change in membrane current, $\\Delta I_{m}$. This relationship is mathematically expressed as:\n$$R_{in} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{m}}{\\Delta I_{m}}$$\nThis is a form of Ohm's Law. To find the change in membrane potential, we rearrange this equation:\n$$\\Delta V_{m} = R_{in} \\cdot \\Delta I_{m}$$\nWe are provided with the following values:\nThe input resistance is $R_{in} = 200\\ \\mathrm{M}\\Omega$.\nThe light stimulus causes the inward current to be reduced by $20\\ \\mathrm{pA}$.\n\nWe must carefully determine the sign of the change in current, $\\Delta I_{m}$, based on the provided conventions. The problem specifies that inward current, which corresponds to positive charge entering the cell, is defined as positive.\nLet $I_{dark}$ be the steady-state inward current in darkness. According to the convention, $I_{dark}$ is a positive value.\nUpon illumination, this inward current is reduced. Let the new steady-state current in the light be $I_{light}$. The reduction is given as $20\\ \\mathrm{pA}$. Therefore:\n$$I_{light} = I_{dark} - 20\\ \\mathrm{pA}$$\nThe change in membrane current, $\\Delta I_{m}$, is the final current minus the initial current:\n$$\\Delta I_{m} = I_{light} - I_{dark}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I_{light}$:\n$$\\Delta I_{m} = (I_{dark} - 20\\ \\mathrm{pA}) - I_{dark} = -20\\ \\mathrm{pA}$$\nThus, the change in current is $\\Delta I_{m} = -20\\ \\mathrm{pA}$. This negative sign indicates a decrease in the inward (positive) current, which is consistent with the problem description.\n\nNow we can calculate $\\Delta V_{m}$. It is imperative to use SI units for a consistent calculation. We convert the given values:\nInput resistance: $R_{in} = 200\\ \\mathrm{M}\\Omega = 200 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\Omega$.\nChange in current: $\\Delta I_{m} = -20\\ \\mathrm{pA} = -20 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{A}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the rearranged Ohm's Law:\n$$\\Delta V_{m} = (200 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\Omega) \\times (-20 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{A})$$\n$$\\Delta V_{m} = -(200 \\times 20) \\times (10^{6} \\times 10^{-12})\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\n$$\\Delta V_{m} = -4000 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\n$$\\Delta V_{m} = -4.0 \\times 10^{3} \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\n$$\\Delta V_{m} = -4.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in millivolts ($\\mathrm{mV}$).

The calculated value of $-4.0\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ must be written as $-4.00\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ to satisfy this requirement.\n\nThis result is physiologically consistent. The initial membrane potential is given as near $-40\\ \\mathrm{mV}$. A change of $-4.00\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ results in a final potential of approximately $-44\\ \\mathrm{mV}$. This decrease in potential (becoming more negative) is termed hyperpolarization, which is the characteristic response of vertebrate photoreceptors to light.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-4.00}$$", "id": "2596532"}, {"introduction": "Moving from a single cell to the entire eye, visual acuity is determined by the interplay between optical quality and photoreceptor sampling.

We will proceed with the analysis. The task is to compute the ratio $R$ of the retinal sampling Nyquist spatial frequency, $\\nu_{\\text{Nyquist}}$, to the optical Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) cutoff spatial frequency, $\\nu_{\\text{cutoff}}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the Nyquist spatial frequency, $\\nu_{\\text{Nyquist}}$, of the photoreceptor mosaic. The sampling theorem dictates that the Nyquist frequency is one-half of the sampling rate. For a discrete spatial sampling system, the sampling rate is the reciprocal of the sampling interval.

We proceed with the derivation as requested.\n\nThe task is to derive the probability of observing at least one event in a time interval of duration $T$, assuming events are generated by a homogeneous Poisson process with a constant rate $\\lambda$. The derivation must begin from the fundamental definition of a Poisson process as the limit of a sequence of Bernoulli trials.\n\nThe core assumptions for this model are:\n$1$. **Stationarity**: The probability of an event occurring in any infinitesimal time interval of duration $d t$ is $\\lambda \\, d t$, where $\\lambda$ is a constant rate independent of time.\n$2$. **Independence**: The number of events in non-overlapping time intervals are independent random variables.\n$3$. **Rarity**: The probability of more than one event occurring in an infinitesimal time interval $d t$ is negligible, i.e., it is of a higher order than $d t$, denoted $o(d t)$.\n\nWe proceed by discretizing the total time interval $T$ into $N$ small, non-overlapping subintervals, each of duration $\\Delta t = \\frac{T}{N}$.
