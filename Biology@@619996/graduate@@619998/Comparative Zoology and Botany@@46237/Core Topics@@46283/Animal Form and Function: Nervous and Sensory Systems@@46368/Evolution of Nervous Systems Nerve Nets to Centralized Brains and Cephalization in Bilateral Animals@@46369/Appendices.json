The time for the efferent signal is:\n$$t_{\\text{efferent}} = \\frac{d_{\\text{efferent}}}{v} = \\frac{L/2}{v} = \\frac{L}{2v}$$\nThe total conduction time for the mid-body configuration, $t_1$, is the sum of the afferent and efferent travel times:\n$$t_1 = t_{\\text{afferent}} + t_{\\text{efferent}} = \\frac{L}{2v} + \\frac{L}{2v} = \\frac{L}{v}$$\n\nNow, let $t_2$ be the reaction time after cephalization, where the decision-making center has moved to the head. In this configuration, the sensory receptors, the decision-making interneurons, and the motor effectors are all co-localized. The problem states that the path lengths between these components are negligible at the scale considered.
