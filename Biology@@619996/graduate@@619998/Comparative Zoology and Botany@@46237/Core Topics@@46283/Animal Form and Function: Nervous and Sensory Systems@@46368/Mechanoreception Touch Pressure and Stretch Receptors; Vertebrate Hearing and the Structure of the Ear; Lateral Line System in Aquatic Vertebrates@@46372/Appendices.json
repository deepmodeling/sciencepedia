It is scientifically grounded in established principles of biophysics and acoustics, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objectively articulated. No flaws are identified. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for a derivation of the pressure amplification ratio of a simplified middle ear model and a subsequent numerical evaluation of this amplification in decibels. The model consists of a tympanic membrane, an ossicular chain acting as a lever, and a stapes footplate.\n\nLet $p_{\\mathrm{air}}$ be the incident acoustic pressure in the air. This pressure acts upon the tympanic membrane, which has an effective area $A_{t}$. According to the definition of pressure, $p = F/A$, the total force $F_{t}$ exerted on the tympanic membrane is the product of the pressure and the area:\n$$F_{t} = p_{\\mathrm{air}} A_{t}$$\nThis force serves as the input force to the ossicular chain, which is modeled as an ideal lever. Let $F_{\\text{in}} = F_{t}$.\n\nThe ossicular chain has a force mechanical advantage denoted by $\\ell$. The definition of this mechanical advantage is given as the ratio of the output force to the input force. Therefore, the output force $F_{s}$, which is the force exerted by the stapes footplate, is:\n$$F_{s} = F_{\\text{out}} = \\ell F_{\\text{in}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $F_{\\text{in}} = F_{t}$, we obtain:\n$$F_{s} = \\ell F_{t} = \\ell (p_{\\mathrm{air}} A_{t})$$\nThis force amplification is the first mechanism for increasing the pressure.\n\nThe amplified force $F_{s}$ is transmitted to the fluid of the inner ear via the stapes footplate, which has an area $A_{s}$. The pressure generated at the oval window, $p_{\\mathrm{ow}}$, is this force distributed over the area $A_{s}$:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{ow}} = \\frac{F_{s}}{A_{s}}$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $F_{s}$:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{ow}} = \\frac{\\ell p_{\\mathrm{air}} A_{t}}{A_{s}}$$\nTo find the required ratio of the pressure at the oval window to the incident air pressure, we rearrange the equation:\n$$\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{ow}}}{p_{\\mathrm{air}}} = \\ell \\frac{A_{t}}{A_{s}}$$\nThis expression represents the total pressure amplification due to two effects: the lever action of the ossicles (factor $\\ell$) and the hydraulic amplification from the area ratio of the tympanic membrane to the stapes footplate (factor $A_{t}/A_{s}$). This is the required analytic expression.\n\nNext, we evaluate this pressure ratio numerically using the provided values: $A_{t} = 50\\ \\text{mm}^{2}$, $A_{s} = 3.2\\ \\text{mm}^{2}$, and $\\ell = 1.4$. The ratio of the areas is dimensionless, so the units cancel as required.\n$$\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{ow}}}{p_{\\mathrm{air}}} = (1.4) \\times \\frac{50}{3.2} = 1.4 \\times 15.625 = 21.875$$\nThe pressure at the oval window is $21.875$ times greater than the incident air pressure.\n\nFinally, we compute the threshold improvement in sound pressure level (SPL), $\\Delta L$, in decibels (dB). The definition provided is:\n$$\\Delta L = 20 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}}\\right)$$\nIn our context, $p_{2} = p_{\\mathrm{ow}}$ and $p_{1} = p_{\\mathrm{air}}$.

The problem is physically well-posed and provides all necessary parameters. The solution proceeds by applying the principle of static equilibrium, where the drag force exerted by the fluid is balanced by the elastic restoring force of the cupula's anchoring spring.\n\nFirst, we establish the condition for static equilibrium. At steady state, the net force on the cupula is zero. The problem statement instructs to neglect the mass and inertia of the cupula assembly, which is appropriate for a static analysis. The two forces acting on the cupula in the direction of flow are the drag force, $F_d$, and the elastic restoring force from the spring, $F_s$. In equilibrium, these forces must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. We can write the balance of their magnitudes as:\n$$F_d = F_s$$\n\nNext, we must formulate expressions for each force based on fundamental principles.\n\nThe drag force, $F_d$, is caused by the fluid flow past the cupula. The problem directs us to use the principle of dynamic pressure scaling. The standard model for drag force on an object in an external flow is given by the drag equation:\n$$F_d = \\frac{1}{2} C_d \\rho A U^2$$\nHere, $C_d$ is the dimensionless drag coefficient, $\\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $A$ is the effective projected frontal area of the object perpendicular to the flow, and $U$ is the speed of the undisturbed flow. All of these quantities are provided in the problem statement.\n\nThe elastic restoring force, $F_s$, is generated by the deformation of the spring-like element at the base of the cupula. The problem specifies that this element behaves as a linear elastic spring. According to Hooke's Law for linear springs, the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position. If the tip of the cupula is deflected by a distance $\\Delta$, the restoring force is given by:\n$$F_s = k \\Delta$$\nHere, $k$ is the spring stiffness or spring constant.\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions for $F_d$ and $F_s$ into the static equilibrium equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} C_d \\rho A U^2 = k \\Delta$$\n\nThis equation relates the fluid flow parameters to the mechanical properties of the cupula and its resulting deflection. The final step in the derivation is to solve this equation for the unknown deflection, $\\Delta$. By rearranging the terms, we obtain the analytical expression for $\\Delta$:\n$$\\Delta = \\frac{C_d \\rho A U^2}{2k}$$\n\nWith the derived expression, we can now compute the numerical value of the deflection using the given parameters:\n- Drag coefficient: $C_d = 1.2$\n- Fluid density: $\\rho = 998\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\n- Projected area: $A = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m^2}$\n- Flow speed: $U = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$\n- Spring stiffness: $k = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{N\\,m^{-1}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\Delta$:\n$$\\Delta = \\frac{(1.2) (998\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) (1.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m^2}) (2.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}})^2}{2 (1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{N\\,m^{-1}})}$$\n\nFirst, calculate the square of the velocity:\n$$U^2 = (2.0 \\times 10^{-2})^2\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-2}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-2}}$$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the equation for $\\Delta$:\n$$\\Delta = \\frac{(1.2) (998) (1.0 \\times 10^{-8}) (4.0 \\times 10^{-4})}{2.0 \\times 10^{-3}}\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nLet's compute the numerator:\n$$Numerator = 1.2 \\times 998 \\times 1.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\times 4.0 \\times 10^{-4} = 4790.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4.7904 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{N}$$\nThe denominator is:\n$$Denominator = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{N\\,m^{-1}}$$\nSo, the deflection in meters is:\n$$\\Delta = \\frac{4.7904 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{N}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{N\\,m^{-1}}} = 2.3952 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) and rounded to three significant figures.

The probability of a state is proportional to the exponent of its negative energy, scaled by the thermal energy $k_B T$. Let the free energy of the closed state be $G_c$ and the open state be $G_o$.\n\nThe ratio of probabilities is given by:\n$$ \\frac{P_o}{P_c} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{G_o}{k_B T}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{G_c}{k_B T}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{G_o - G_c}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G(x)}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nThe probabilities must sum to unity: $P_o + P_c = 1$. From this, we have $P_c = 1 - P_o$.\nSubstituting this into the ratio equation:\n$$ \\frac{P_o}{1 - P_o} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G(x)}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nSolving for $P_o$:\n$$ P_o = (1 - P_o) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G(x)}{k_B T}\\right) $$\n$$ P_o \\left[1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G(x)}{k_B T}\\right)\\right] = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G(x)}{k_B T}\\right) $$\n$$ P_o(x) = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G(x)}{k_B T}\\right)}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G(x)}{k_B T}\\right)} $$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\exp\\left(+\\frac{\\Delta G(x)}{k_B T}\\right)$ gives the more common logistic form:\n$$ P_o(x) = \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(+\\frac{\\Delta G(x)}{k_B T}\\right) + 1} $$\nSubstituting the given expression $\\Delta G(x) = \\Delta G_0 - f x$:\n$$ P_o(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_0 - f x}{k_B T}\\right)} $$\n\n**2) Derivation of the transduction current $I(x)$**\n\nThe total current $I(x)$ through the single channel is the single-channel current when open, $i_{open}$, multiplied by the probability that the channel is open, $P_o(x)$. The current is zero when the channel is closed.\nThe problem states that the open channel is an ohmic conductor with conductance $g$ and driving potential $V_E$. According to Ohm's law, the current is:\n$$ i_{open} = g V_E $$\nThe ensemble-averaged transduction current is therefore:\n$$ I(x) = i_{open} P_o(x) + i_{closed} P_c(x) = (g V_E) P_o(x) + (0) P_c(x) $$\n$$ I(x) = g V_E P_o(x) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $P_o(x)$ from part (1):\n$$ I(x) = g V_E \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_0 - f x}{k_B T}\\right)} $$\n\n**3) Derivation of sensitivity $S(x)$, $x_{1/2}$, and $S_{\\max}$**\n\nThe displacement sensitivity is defined as $S(x) = dI/dx$. We differentiate the expression for $I(x)$ with respect to $x$.\nLet the argument of the exponential be $A(x) = \\frac{\\Delta G_0 - f x}{k_B T}$. Then $\\frac{dA}{dx} = -\\frac{f}{k_B T}$.\nThe expression for current is $I(x) = g V_E [1 + \\exp(A(x))]^{-1}$.\nUsing the chain rule for differentiation:\n$$ S(x) = \\frac{dI}{dx} = g V_E \\cdot (-1) [1 + \\exp(A(x))]^{-2} \\cdot \\exp(A(x)) \\cdot \\frac{dA}{dx} $$\n$$ S(x) = -g V_E \\frac{\\exp(A(x))}{\\left(1 + \\exp(A(x))\\right)^2} \\left(-\\frac{f}{k_B T}\\right) $$\n$$ S(x) = \\frac{g V_E f}{k_B T} \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_0 - f x}{k_B T}\\right)}{\\left[1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_0 - f x}{k_B T}\\right)\\right]^2} $$\nThis is the expression for sensitivity $S(x)$.\n\nNext, we find the displacement $x_{1/2}$ where $P_o(x_{1/2}) = 1/2$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = P_o(x_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_0 - f x_{1/2}}{k_B T}\\right)} $$\nThis implies:\n$$ 2 = 1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_0 - f x_{1/2}}{k_B T}\\right) $$\n$$ 1 = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_0 - f x_{1/2}}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides, we find the exponent must be zero:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{\\Delta G_0 - f x_{1/2}}{k_B T} $$\n$$ \\Delta G_0 = f x_{1/2} $$\n$$ x_{1/2} = \\frac{\\Delta G_0}{f} $$\nThis is the displacement for half-maximal activation.\n\nFinally, we evaluate $S(x)$ at $x = x_{1/2}$ to find the maximal slope $S_{\\max}$. The maximum slope of a logistic function occurs at its midpoint, so $S(x_{1/2})$ is indeed $S_{\\max}$.\nAt $x = x_{1/2}$, the argument of the exponential in the expression for $S(x)$ becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta G_0 - f x_{1/2}}{k_B T} = \\frac{\\Delta G_0 - f (\\Delta G_0 / f)}{k_B T} = \\frac{0}{k_B T} = 0 $$\nSo, $\\exp(0) = 1$. Substituting this into the expression for $S(x)$:\n$$ S_{\\max} = S(x_{1/2}) = \\frac{g V_E f}{k_B T} \\frac{\\exp(0)}{\\left[1 + \\exp(0)\\right]^2} $$\n$$ S_{\\max} = \\frac{g V_E f}{k_B T} \\frac{1}{(1 + 1)^2} = \\frac{g V_E f}{k_B T} \\frac{1}{4} $$\nThus, the maximal sensitivity is:\n$$ S_{\\max} = \\frac{g V_E f}{4 k_B T} $$\nThis expression gives the maximum rate of change of current with respect to bundle displacement, evaluated at the point of half-maximal activation.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{g V_{E} f}{4 k_{B} T}} $$", "id": "2588921"}]}
