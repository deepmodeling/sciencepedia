It is a standard exercise in applying principles of static equilibrium to biophysical models of cells. The solution will proceed.\n\n**Derivation of Pressure-Tension Relations**\n\nThe method to solve this problem is to apply Newton's second law for a system in static equilibrium. We consider an imaginary cut that divides the spherical cell into two hemispheres and analyze the forces acting on one hemisphere.\n\n**Part 1: Plant Cell Analysis**\n\nConsider a hemisphere of the plant cell. The forces acting on this hemisphere in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the cut must sum to zero for equilibrium. These forces are:\n1.  The force due to the internal pressure difference $\\Delta P$, acting on the circular area of the cut.\n2.  The resisting tensile force within the material of the cell wall, acting on the cross-sectional area of the wall at the cut.\n\nThe force due to pressure, $F_P$, acts on the projected area of the hemisphere, which is a circle of radius $R$. This area is $A_P = \\pi R^2$. The force is thus:\n$$F_P = \\Delta P \\cdot A_P = \\Delta P \\cdot \\pi R^2$$\nThis force acts to push the two hemispheres apart.\n\nThe resisting force due to wall stress, $F_T$, acts along the circumference of the cut. The stress is given as $T$ (force per unit area). This stress acts over the cross-sectional area of the cell wall, which is an annulus. The circumference of this annulus at radius $R$ is $C = 2\\pi R$. Given the wall thickness is $t$, the cross-sectional area of the wall, $A_W$, under the thin-shell approximation ($t \\ll R$) is:\n$$A_W \\approx (2\\pi R) \\cdot t$$\nThe total tensile force resisting separation is the stress multiplied by this area:\n$$F_T = T \\cdot A_W = T \\cdot (2\\pi R t)$$\n\nFor static equilibrium, these two opposing forces must be equal in magnitude:\n$$F_P = F_T$$\n$$\\Delta P \\cdot \\pi R^2 = T \\cdot (2\\pi R t)$$\n\nWe solve this equation for the turgor pressure $\\Delta P$:\n$$\\Delta P = \\frac{T \\cdot (2\\pi R t)}{\\pi R^2}$$\nSimplifying the expression by canceling common factors of $\\pi$ and $R$ yields the pressure-stress relation for the plant cell:\n$$\\Delta P = \\frac{2 T t}{R}$$\n\nThis is the well-known Barlow's formula for the hoop stress in a thin-walled spherical pressure vessel.\n\n**Part 2: Animal Cell Analysis**\n\nWe perform an analogous analysis for the animal cell. Let the cortical tension be denoted by $\\gamma$, which has units of force per unit length.\n\nAgain, consider a hemisphere in static equilibrium. The force due to pressure, $F_P$, is identical to the plant cell case:\n$$F_P = \\Delta P \\cdot \\pi R^2$$\n\nThe resisting force is now provided by the cortical tension $\\gamma$ acting along the perimeter of the cut. The length of this perimeter (the circumference) is $L = 2\\pi R$. The total force due to cortical tension, $F_\\gamma$, is:\n$$F_\\gamma = \\gamma \\cdot L = \\gamma \\cdot (2\\pi R)$$\n\nFor static equilibrium, we equate the forces:\n$$F_P = F_\\gamma$$\n$$\\Delta P \\cdot \\pi R^2 = \\gamma \\cdot (2\\pi R)$$\n\nSolving for the pressure difference $\\Delta P$:\n$$\\Delta P = \\frac{\\gamma \\cdot (2\\pi R)}{\\pi R^2}$$\n$$\\Delta P = \\frac{2 \\gamma}{R}$$\n\nThis is the Young-Laplace equation for a spherical interface.\n\n**Part 3: Comparison and Mapping**\n\nThe problem asks for the mapping between the plant wall stress $T$ and the animal cortical tension $\\gamma$ that results in the same pressure difference $\\Delta P$ for the same radius $R$. To find this, we equate the two expressions derived for $\\Delta P$:\n$$\\frac{2 T t}{R} = \\frac{2 \\gamma}{R}$$\nMultiplying both sides by $\\frac{R}{2}$ gives the direct relationship:\n$$T \\cdot t = \\gamma$$\nThis result is physically intuitive. The quantity $T \\cdot t$ (stress $\\times$ thickness) represents the force per unit length of circumference in the plant cell wall, which is precisely the definition of the cortical tension $\\gamma$ in the animal cell membrane. Thus, the product $T t$ is the analogous physical quantity to $\\gamma$.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation**\n\nThe problem requires a final expression for the plant-cell turgor pressure $\\Delta P$ as a function of $T$, $R$, and $t$. This was derived in Part 1. The result is:\n$$\\Delta P = \\frac{2 T t}{R}$$\nThis is the final answer to be presented.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2Tt}{R}}$$", "id": "2555682"}, {"introduction": "The cell membrane is not just a mechanical barrier; it is a dynamic electrochemical interface.

We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation and comparison of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) economy for two distinct metabolic processes: the synthesis of sucrose in a plant cell and the complete oxidation of glucose in an animal cell. Let us address each task systematically.\n\nFirst, we must determine the total number of ATP molecules, or their energetic equivalents, hydrolyzed to synthesize one molecule of sucrose ($\\mathrm{C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}}$) from carbon dioxide ($\\mathrm{CO_{2}}$) in a plant cell.\n\nSucrose is a disaccharide with $12$ carbon atoms. Its synthesis from atmospheric $\\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ initiates with the Calvin-Benson cycle, which produces triose phosphates, molecules containing $3$ carbon atoms. To construct one molecule of sucrose, a total of $12$ carbon atoms must be fixed. This requires the net production of $\\frac{12}{3} = 4$ molecules of triose phosphate.\n\nThe problem provides the stoichiometry for the Calvin-Benson cycle: for every $3$ molecules of $\\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ fixed, $1$ net molecule of triose phosphate is produced at a cost of $9$ ATP and $6$ NADPH. To obtain the required $4$ molecules of net triose phosphate, the cycle must effectively operate to produce this amount. The cost is therefore scaled proportionally.\n\nLet $C_{\\text{fix}}$ be the cost in ATP to produce $4$ molecules of triose phosphate.\n$$C_{\\text{fix}} = 4 \\text{ triose-P} \\times \\frac{9 \\text{ ATP}}{1 \\text{ triose-P}} = 36 \\text{ ATP}$$\nThe problem explicitly instructs to count only ATP or ATP-equivalents hydrolyzed and not to convert the cost of NADPH to an ATP equivalent. The energy for NADPH reduction is provided by the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, not by the ATP pool we are accounting for.\n\nNext, we consider the cytosolic synthesis of sucrose from the $4$ triose phosphate molecules. These $4$ molecules are first converted into two hexose phosphate units. The assembly of sucrose then proceeds. The problem states that the activation of one glucose moiety to uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-glucose) consumes $1$ molecule of uridine triphosphate (UTP). This UTP hydrolysis is energetically equivalent to the hydrolysis of $1$ ATP. The reaction is UTP + glucose-1-P $\\rightarrow$ UDP-glucose + PPi. The subsequent hydrolysis of pyrophosphate (PPi) to two inorganic phosphates (Pi) makes the overall reaction highly favorable. The regeneration of UTP from UDP is catalyzed by nucleoside diphosphate kinase using ATP (UDP + ATP $\\leftrightarrow$ UTP + ADP), so the net cost to the cell's ATP pool is indeed $1$ ATP.\n\nLet $C_{\\text{asm}}$ be this assembly cost.\n$$C_{\\text{asm}} = 1 \\text{ ATP-equivalent}$$\n\nThe total ATP cost to synthesize one molecule of sucrose, which we denote as $C_{\\text{sucrose}}$, is the sum of the cost of carbon fixation and the cost of assembly.\n$$C_{\\text{sucrose}} = C_{\\text{fix}} + C_{\\text{asm}} = 36 \\text{ ATP} + 1 \\text{ ATP} = 37 \\text{ ATP}$$\n\nSecond, we must determine the total number of ATP molecules produced from the complete oxidation of one molecule of glucose ($\\mathrm{C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}}$) in an animal hepatocyte.
