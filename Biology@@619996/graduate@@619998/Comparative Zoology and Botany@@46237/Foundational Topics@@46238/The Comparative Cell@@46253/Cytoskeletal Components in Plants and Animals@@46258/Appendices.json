{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Microtubules are not static polymers but exist in a state of dynamic instability, a foundational principle of the cytoskeleton. This behavior is governed by stochastic switches between phases of growth and shrinkage. In this exercise, you will use the principles of transport and reaction kinetics to derive a classic model for microtubule dynamics, connecting the microscopic rate constants for catastrophe ($f_c$) and rescue ($f_r$) to the macroscopic steady-state mean length, $\\langle L \\rangle$. By applying this model to parameter sets typical for animal and plant cells, you will see how quantitative differences in filament dynamics can give rise to distinct cytoskeletal architectures.", "problem": "Microtubules in both animal and plant cells exhibit dynamic instability: an individual microtubule tip is either in a growing state or a shrinking state. In the growing state, its length increases deterministically at speed $v_{g}$; in the shrinking state, its length decreases deterministically at speed $v_{s}$. Stochastic switching between these states occurs as independent Poisson processes with constant catastrophe rate $f_{c}$ (growth to shrinkage) and rescue rate $f_{r}$ (shrinkage to growth). Assume the following fundamental idealizations: the medium is effectively unbounded so that there is no cell boundary constraint on length, when a microtubule shrinks to zero length it is immediately renucleated into the growing state (so that total number is conserved), and there is no severing, capping, or aging of the lattice. \n\nStarting from conservation of probability in length space (continuity equations) and the definition of the Poisson switching processes, derive a closed-form expression for the steady-state mean length $\\langle L \\rangle$ in terms of $v_{g}$, $v_{s}$, $f_{c}$, and $f_{r}$, under the condition that a steady state exists.

Condition: A steady state must exist.\n\nValidation:\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem describes the two-state model of microtubule dynamic instability, a foundational concept in cytoskeletal biophysics established by Dogterom and Leibler. The model is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary parameters and boundary conditions (renucleation at zero length, decay at infinite length) to derive a unique solution for the mean length. It correctly anticipates the need to establish the condition for a steady state.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative language, free of subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard exercise in biophysical transport theory. I will proceed to the derivation.\n\nLet $c_{g}(x,t)$ and $c_{s}(x,t)$ be the probability densities for finding a growing and a shrinking microtubule, respectively, with length $x$ at time $t$. The dynamics of these populations are governed by continuity equations that account for advection (growth/shrinkage) and reaction (state switching).\n\nThe continuity equation for the growing population is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c_{g}}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(v_{g} c_{g}) = -f_{c} c_{g} + f_{r} c_{s} $$\nThe continuity equation for the shrinking population is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c_{s}}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-v_{s} c_{s}) = +f_{c} c_{g} - f_{r} c_{s} $$\nSince the speeds $v_{g}$ and $v_{s}$ are constant, these equations simplify to:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c_{g}}{\\partial t} = -v_{g} \\frac{\\partial c_{g}}{\\partial x} - f_{c} c_{g} + f_{r} c_{s} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c_{s}}{\\partial t} = v_{s} \\frac{\\partial c_{s}}{\\partial x} + f_{c} c_{g} - f_{r} c_{s} $$\nIn the steady state, the time derivatives are zero ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$). The system reduces to a pair of coupled ordinary differential equations:\n$$ 0 = -v_{g} \\frac{d c_{g}}{d x} - f_{c} c_{g} + f_{r} c_{s} \\quad (1) $$\n$$ 0 = v_{s} \\frac{d c_{s}}{d x} + f_{c} c_{g} - f_{r} c_{s} \\quad (2) $$\nAdding equation ($1$) and equation ($2$) yields:\n$$ 0 = -v_{g} \\frac{d c_{g}}{d x} + v_{s} \\frac{d c_{s}}{d x} = \\frac{d}{dx} (-v_{g} c_{g} + v_{s} c_{s}) $$\nThis implies that the net probability flux, $J(x) = v_{g} c_{g}(x) - v_{s} c_{s}(x)$, is constant for $x > 0$. For a physically realistic steady state with a finite mean length, the probability densities must vanish as length goes to infinity, i.e., $c_{g}(\\infty) \\to 0$ and $c_{s}(\\infty) \\to 0$. This requires the constant flux $J$ to be zero. A non-zero flux would imply a net transport of probability to or from infinity, which is inconsistent with a steady state. Therefore, for all $x > 0$:\n$$ v_{g} c_{g}(x) - v_{s} c_{s}(x) = 0 \\implies v_{g} c_{g}(x) = v_{s} c_{s}(x) $$\nThis relation shows that in the steady state, the flux of growing microtubules past any length $x$ is perfectly balanced by the flux of shrinking microtubules. We can now express $c_{s}(x)$ in terms of $c_{g}(x)$:\n$$ c_{s}(x) = \\frac{v_{g}}{v_{s}} c_{g}(x) $$\nSubstituting this back into equation ($1$):\n$$ v_{g} \\frac{d c_{g}}{d x} = -f_{c} c_{g} + f_{r} \\left(\\frac{v_{g}}{v_{s}} c_{g}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{f_{r} v_{g}}{v_{s}} - f_{c}\\right)c_{g} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{c_{g}} \\frac{d c_{g}}{d x} = \\frac{f_{r}}{v_{s}} - \\frac{f_{c}}{v_{g}} $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation with the solution:\n$$ c_{g}(x) = c_{g}(0) \\exp\\left[ \\left(\\frac{f_{r}}{v_{s}} - \\frac{f_{c}}{v_{g}}\\right) x \\right] $$\nFor the distribution to be normalizable (i.e., for the total probability over all lengths to be finite), the integral of the distribution over $[0, \\infty)$ must converge. This requires the argument of the exponential to be negative. Thus, the condition for existence of a steady state is:\n$$ \\frac{f_{r}}{v_{s}} - \\frac{f_{c}}{v_{g}} < 0 \\implies v_{g} f_{r} < v_{s} f_{c} $$\nIf this condition is not met, the average length will grow without bound.\n\nLet us verify this condition for the given parameters:\n- Animal-like: $v_{g}f_{r} = (0.25)(0.050) = 0.0125$. $v_{s}f_{c} = (0.50)(0.20) = 0.100$. Since $0.0125 < 0.100$, a steady state exists.\n- Plant-like: $v_{g}f_{r} = (0.090)(0.030) = 0.0027$. $v_{s}f_{c} = (0.180)(0.060) = 0.0108$. Since $0.0027 < 0.0108$, a steady state exists.\n\nThe total length distribution is $P(x) = c_{g}(x) + c_{s}(x) = c_{g}(x) + \\frac{v_{g}}{v_{s}}c_{g}(x) = \\left(1 + \\frac{v_{g}}{v_{s}}\\right) c_{g}(x)$.\nThis distribution is a decaying exponential: $P(x) = C \\exp(-\\lambda x)$, where $C$ is a normalization constant and the decay constant $\\lambda$ is:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{f_{c}}{v_{g}} - \\frac{f_{r}}{v_{s}} $$\nThe mean length $\\langle L \\rangle$ of a random variable following an exponential distribution $P(x) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda x)$ is given by $\\langle L \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$.\nThus, the steady-state mean microtubule length is:\n$$ \\langle L \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\frac{f_{c}}{v_{g}} - \\frac{f_{r}}{v_{s}}} = \\frac{v_{g}v_{s}}{v_{s}f_{c} - v_{g}f_{r}} $$\nThis is the required closed-form expression. Now, we evaluate it for the two cases.\n\nFor the animal-like parameters:\n$$ \\langle L \\rangle_{\\mathrm{animal}} = \\frac{(0.25)(0.50)}{(0.50)(0.20) - (0.25)(0.050)} = \\frac{0.125}{0.100 - 0.0125} = \\frac{0.125}{0.0875} $$\n$$ \\langle L \\rangle_{\\mathrm{animal}} = \\frac{1250}{875} = \\frac{10 \\times 125}{7 \\times 125} = \\frac{10}{7} $$\n\nFor the plant-like parameters:\n$$ \\langle L \\rangle_{\\mathrm{plant}} = \\frac{(0.090)(0.180)}{(0.180)(0.060) - (0.090)(0.030)} = \\frac{0.0162}{0.0108 - 0.0027} = \\frac{0.0162}{0.0081} $$\n$$ \\langle L \\rangle_{\\mathrm{plant}} = \\frac{162}{81} = 2 $$\n\nFinally, we compute the dimensionless ratio $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\langle L \\rangle_{\\mathrm{plant}}}{\\langle L \\rangle_{\\mathrm{animal}}} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{10}{7}} = 2 \\times \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{14}{10} $$\nAs a reduced fraction, this is:\n$$ R = \\frac{7}{5} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{7}{5}}$$", "id": "2563763"}, {"introduction": "Quantifying the dynamic turnover of cytoskeletal networks in living cells is a central task in modern cell biology.

It provides a discrete set of options and sufficient background information (drug specificities and mechanisms) to logically deduce a unique solution.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and free of subjectivity or ambiguity.\n4.  **Completeness**: All necessary information to solve the problem is provided within the \"Fundamental Base\" and \"Assumptions\" sections. No external knowledge is strictly required, as the problem supplies its own self-contained logical framework.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a logical deduction. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe objective is to disrupt plant cytokinesis while preserving animal cytokinesis. We must analyze the molecular requirements of each process and select a drug that targets the plant-specific machinery.\n\n1.  **Plant Cytokinesis Machinery**: The primary structure is the phragmoplast, an array of **microtubules**. Therefore, an effective inhibitor must disrupt plant microtubules.\n\n2.  **Animal Cytokinesis Machinery**: The primary structure is the contractile ring, composed of **F-actin** and **non-muscle myosin II**. Additionally, for cytokinesis to occur, the cell must first successfully complete mitosis, which requires functional **animal microtubules** for the mitotic spindle. Therefore, a successful selective drug must *not* significantly disrupt animal F-actin, animal non-muscle myosin II, or animal microtubules.\n\nBased on these two points, the ideal agent will exhibit high potency against plant microtubules and low potency against all three key animal cytoskeletal systems. We will now evaluate each option against these criteria.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Oryzalin at $\\;0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\;$ in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)**\n- **Effect on Plant Cells**: The problem states that oryzalin \"disrupt[s] plant microtubules at submicromolar concentrations\". The concentration of $\\;0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\;$ falls within this range. This will disrupt the microtubule-based phragmoplast, thereby abolishing plant cytokinesis. This satisfies the primary objective.\n- **Effect on Animal Cells**: The problem states that oryzalin has \"negligible effects on animal microtubules at the same concentrations\". Oryzalin does not target actin or myosin. Therefore, at $\\;0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\;$, it will not significantly affect the animal mitotic spindle (microtubules) or the contractile ring (F-actin and myosin II). Animal cytokinesis will remain largely intact.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**. This option achieves the specified selective inhibition.\n\n**B. Latrunculin B at $\\;0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\;$ in DMSO**\n- **Effect on Plant Cells**: The problem states latrunculin B \"disrupts F-actin in both kingdoms at submicromolar concentrations\". While actin plays a role in phragmoplast guidance, disrupting it may not be sufficient to \"abolish\" cytokinesis, which is primarily a microtubule-driven process.\n- **Effect on Animal Cells**: The contractile ring that drives animal cytokinesis is made of F-actin. At $\\;0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\;$, latrunculin B will disrupt the contractile ring, abolishing animal cytokinesis. This directly violates the condition that animal cytokinesis should be left \"largely intact\".\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This drug is not selective and strongly inhibits the target animal process.\n\n**C. Blebbistatin at $\\;25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\;$ in DMSO**\n- **Effect on Plant Cells**: The problem states blebbistatin \"does not inhibit plant myosins\". Therefore, it will have no effect on plant cytokinesis. This fails to meet the primary objective.\n- **Effect on Animal Cells**: The problem states blebbistatin inhibits non-muscle myosin II, a critical motor for the animal contractile ring. At $\\;25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\;$, a standard effective concentration, it will abolish animal cytokinesis. This is the opposite of the desired outcome.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This compound selectively targets animal cells, not plant cells.\n\n**D. Paclitaxel (taxol) at $\\;50\\,\\mathrm{nM}\\;$ in DMSO**\n- **Effect on Plant Cells**: The problem states paclitaxel is \"far less effective in plants\". At the low nanomolar concentration of $\\;50\\,\\mathrm{nM}\\;$, it is not expected to have a significant effect on the plant phragmoplast. This fails to meet the primary objective.\n- **Effect on Animal Cells**: The problem states paclitaxel \"stabilize[s] animal microtubules at nanomolar concentrations\". At $\\;50\\,\\mathrm{nM}\\;$, this will affect the dynamics of the mitotic spindle, typically leading to a mitotic arrest. A cell arrested in mitosis cannot proceed to cytokinesis. This violates the condition that animal cell division remains \"largely intact\".\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This drug targets animal cells, not plant cells, and perturbs mitosis, which prevents cytokinesis from occurring.\n\n**E. Nocodazole at $\\;5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\;$ in DMSO**\n- **Effect on Plant Cells**: The problem states nocodazole is \"much less potent in plants\". A concentration of $\\;5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\;$ is unlikely to disrupt the plant phragmoplast effectively. This fails to meet the primary objective.\n- **Effect on Animal Cells**: The problem states nocodazole \"depolymerizes animal microtubules at low micromolar concentrations\". The given concentration of $\\;5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\;$ will disrupt the animal mitotic spindle, causing mitotic arrest and preventing the cell from entering cytokinesis. This violates the condition that animal cell division remains \"largely intact\".\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This drug selectively targets animal microtubules, leading to a failure of mitosis, which precludes cytokinesis.\n\nConclusion: Only oryzalin at the specified concentration meets all requirements for selective abolition of plant cytokinesis while preserving animal cytokinesis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2563823"}]}
