There are $n$ positional markers, corresponding to the posterior edges of pair-rule stripes, at positions $x_k$ where $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$. The problem states these markers are \"uniformly spaced\". A direct and standard interpretation of this condition, starting from the anterior pole at position $0$, is that the distance between any two consecutive markers, and from the pole to the first marker, is a constant value, $\\Delta x$.\nThus, the position of the first marker is $x_1 = \\Delta x$.\nThe position of the second is $x_2 = x_1 + \\Delta x = 2\\Delta x$.\nBy induction, the position of the $k$-th marker is given by the relation:\n$$x_k = k\\Delta x$$\n\n1) To derive an expression for the uniform stripe spacing $\\Delta x$:\nThe problem states that the $n$ stripes partition the total length $L$.

The distance the front moves in time $T$ is the product of its speed and the duration.

Let the anterior and posterior regions be denoted by subscripts $A$ and $P$, respectively. The somite lengths in these regions, $L_A$ and $L_P$, are determined by the local clock periods, $T_A$ and $T_P$. The front speed $v$ is stated to be uniform.\nAccording to the principle:\n$$L_A = v T_A$$\n$$L_P = v T_P$$\n\nThe problem states that \"the posterior period is larger than the anterior period by a fractional amount of $0.10$.\" This is a precise mathematical statement relating $T_P$ and $T_A$. The fractional difference relative to the anterior period is $0.10$. This translates to the equation:\n$$\\frac{T_P - T_A}{T_A} = 0.10$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to express $T_P$ in terms of $T_A$:\n$$T_P - T_A = 0.10 \\times T_A$$\n$$T_P = T_A + 0.10 \\times T_A$$\n$$T_P = T_A (1 + 0.10) = 1.10 \\times T_A$$\n\nThe objective is to find the posterior-to-anterior somite length ratio, $R$, which is defined as:\n$$R = \\frac{L_P}{L_A}$$\nWe substitute the expressions for $L_P$ and $L_A$ into this ratio:\n$$R = \\frac{v T_P}{v T_A}$$\nSince the front speed $v$ is uniform, it is a common factor in the numerator and denominator and can be cancelled:\n$$R = \\frac{T_P}{T_A}$$\nNow, we substitute the relationship we derived between $T_P$ and $T_A$:\n$$R = \\frac{1.10 \\times T_A}{T_A}$$\nThe term $T_A$ also cancels, yielding the value of the ratio:\n$$R = 1.10$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
