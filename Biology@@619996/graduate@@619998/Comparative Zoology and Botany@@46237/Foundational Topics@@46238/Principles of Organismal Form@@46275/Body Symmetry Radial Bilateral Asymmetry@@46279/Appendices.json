Consider a pond snail species with two inbred lines: one yields exclusively dextral-coiled adults and the other yields exclusively sinistral-coiled adults. Let a single nuclear locus with alleles $D$ (dextral) and $d$ (sinistral) be a plausible causal basis. It is unknown whether the coiling phenotype of an individual is specified by its own zygotic genotype (zygotic-effect model) or by a maternal-effect gene product deposited into the oocyte (maternal-effect model).

The problem provides two inbred lines (dextral and sinistral), proposes a single-locus, two-allele model ($D, d$), and outlines the fundamental definitions of Mendelian inheritance, zygotic control, maternal-effect control, and the utility of reciprocal crosses.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   **Organism**: A pond snail species.\n-   **Trait**: Adult shell coiling (chirality), with two phenotypes: dextral and sinistral.\n-   **Genetic Stocks**: Two inbred lines, one exclusively dextral-coiled and one exclusively sinistral-coiled.\n-   **Hypothesized Genetic Basis**: A single nuclear locus with two alleles, $D$ and $d$. The dextral line is genotypically pure, and the sinistral line is genotypically pure. By convention, we can assign the genotype $DD$ to the pure-breeding dextral line and $dd$ to the pure-breeding sinistral line, assuming $D$ is dominant for the dextral trait.\n-   **Competing Models**:\n    1.  **Zygotic-effect model**: The phenotype of an individual is determined by its own zygotic genotype.\n    2.  **Maternal-effect model**: The phenotype of an individual is determined by the genotype of its mother.\n-   **Assumptions**: Standard Mendelian segregation, random mating (when applicable), and no differential viability among genotypes.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated based on the established criteria.\n\n-   **Scientific Groundedness**: The problem is grounded in established principles of transmission genetics and developmental biology. The maternal inheritance of snail coiling is a canonical example taught in genetics, originally described in the snail *Lymnaea peregra*. The proposed models and experimental designs are entirely valid.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for an experimental design and expected results to discriminate between two clearly defined, mutually exclusive hypotheses. A unique and meaningful solution exists.\n-   **Objective**: The language is precise, technical, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n-   **Check for Flaws**: The problem statement does not violate any of the disqualifying criteria. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, realistic, well-posed, and non-trivial.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived by analyzing the outcomes of genetic crosses under each model.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nLet us systematically derive the expected phenotypic ratios for the generations of interest ($P$, $F_1$, $F_2$, $F_3$) under both the zygotic-effect and maternal-effect models. We will assume the pure-breeding dextral line is genotype $DD$ and the pure-breeding sinistral line is genotype $dd$. This implies that the allele for dextral coiling ($D$) is dominant to the allele for sinistral coiling ($d$) at the level of gene action, which manifests differently in the two models.\n\n**Parental (P) Generation:**\n-   Dextral line: Phenotype is dextral, genotype is $DD$.\n-   Sinistral line: Phenotype is sinistral, genotype is $dd$.\n\n**Model 1: Zygotic-Effect Control**\nUnder this model, the phenotype is determined by the individual’s own genotype.\n-   Genotypes $DD$ and $Dd$ $\\rightarrow$ Dextral phenotype.\n-   Genotype $dd$ $\\rightarrow$ Sinistral phenotype.\n\n1.  **Reciprocal Crosses to produce $F_1$:**\n    -   Cross A: $DD$ (female, dextral) $\\times$ $dd$ (male, sinistral). All $F_1$ offspring have genotype $Dd$. Their phenotype is **dextral**.\n    -   Cross B: $dd$ (female, sinistral) $\\times$ $DD$ (male, dextral). All $F_1$ offspring have genotype $Dd$. Their phenotype is also **dextral**.\n    -   *Conclusion for $F_1$*: Reciprocal crosses yield identical results: all $F_1$ individuals are dextral.\n\n2.  **$F_2$ Generation from $F_1$ self-fertilization:**\n    -   Cross: $Dd$ (dextral) $\\times$ $Dd$ (dextral).\n    -   Genotypic ratio of $F_2$ offspring: $1/4 \\, DD : 1/2 \\, Dd : 1/4 \\, dd$.\n    -   Phenotypic ratio of $F_2$ offspring: $3/4$ dextral ($DD$ and $Dd$) : $1/4$ sinistral ($dd$). This is the standard Mendelian $3:1$ ratio.\n\n**Model 2: Maternal-Effect Control**\nUnder this model, the phenotype is determined by the mother's genotype.\n-   Offspring of mothers with genotype $DD$ or $Dd$ are phenotypically dextral.\n-   Offspring of mothers with genotype $dd$ are phenotypically sinistral.\n\n1.  **Reciprocal Crosses to produce $F_1$:**\n    -   Cross A: $DD$ (female, dextral) $\\times$ $dd$ (male, sinistral). The mother's genotype is $DD$. Therefore, all $F_1$ offspring are **dextral**. Their own genotype is $Dd$.\n    -   Cross B: $dd$ (female, sinistral) $\\times$ $DD$ (male, dextral). The mother's genotype is $dd$. Therefore, all $F_1$ offspring are **sinistral**. Their own genotype is also $Dd$.\n    -   *Conclusion for $F_1$*: Reciprocal crosses yield different results. The phenotype of the $F_1$ generation depends on the mother's genotype (and thus her phenotype, since she is from a pure line). This is a critical diagnostic observation.\n\n2.  **$F_2$ Generation from $F_1$ self-fertilization:**\n    -   We must consider the $F_1$ from both reciprocal crosses. However, their genotype is identical ($Dd$). Let us self-fertilize any $F_1$ individual.\n    -   Cross: $F_1$ individual (genotype $Dd$) self-fertilizes. The \"mother\" of the $F_2$ generation is this $F_1$ individual, with genotype $Dd$.\n    -   Because the mother's genotype is $Dd$, all $F_2$ offspring are phenotypically **dextral**, regardless of their own genotype.\n    -   Genotypic ratio of $F_2$ offspring: $1/4 \\, DD : 1/2 \\, Dd : 1/4 \\, dd$. This segregation is masked at the phenotypic level.\n\n3.  **$F_3$ Generation from self-fertilization of individual $F_2$ snails:**\n    -   We self-fertilize a random sample of $F_2$ individuals and examine the broods (the $F_3$ generation). The phenotype of an $F_3$ brood is determined by the genotype of its $F_2$ mother.\n    -   $1/4$ of $F_2$ mothers have genotype $DD$. Their $F_3$ offspring will all be **dextral**.\n    -   $1/2$ of $F_2$ mothers have genotype $Dd$. Their $F_3$ offspring will all be **dextral**.\n    -   $1/4$ of $F_2$ mothers have genotype $dd$. Their $F_3$ offspring will all be **sinistral**.\n    -   *Conclusion for $F_3$*: We do not see phenotypic segregation within a brood. Instead, we see segregation of brood phenotypes: $3/4$ of the $F_2$ mothers ($DD$ or $Dd$) produce all-dextral broods, while $1/4$ of the $F_2$ mothers ($dd$) produce all-sinistral broods. This delayed segregation is the hallmark of a maternal effect.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Assume a single nuclear maternal-effect locus with $D$ dominant to $d$. Perform reciprocal crosses between pure lines... self the $F_1$... establish $F_3$ families by selfing random $F_2$ females...**\n-   **Model and Cross Design**: This option correctly states a testable hypothesis and proposes a comprehensive crossing scheme that extends to the $F_3$ generation, which is necessary to fully confirm a maternal effect.\n-   **Predictions (Maternal Effect)**:\n    -   \"...reciprocal $F_1$ will differ—$dd$ mothers produce all sinistral $F_1$, $DD$ mothers produce all dextral $F_1$—despite identical $F_1$ genotypes ($Dd$)\". This is correct as per our derivation.\n    -   \"All $F_2$ from selfed $F_1$ mothers (which are $Dd$) will be dextral...\". This is correct.\n    -   \"...$F_2$ genotypes segregate $1/4\\,DD:1/2\\,Dd:1/4\\,dd$, which is revealed one generation later in the $F_3$: specifically, $1/4$ of $F_2$ mothers (the $dd$) produce $F_3$ broods that are all sinistral, while $3/4$ of $F_2$ mothers (the $DD$ or $Dd$) produce $F_3$ broods that are all dextral.\" This is also entirely correct.\n-   **Contrast with Zygotic Model**:\n    -   \"...incompatible with a zygotic-effect model, which predicts both reciprocal $F_1$ to be all dextral...\". Correct.\n    -   \"...and $F_2$ to segregate dextral:sinistral at $3:1$ within each sibship.\" Correct.\n-   **Verdict**: This option provides a correct and comprehensive experimental design, correctly predicts the outcomes for the maternal-effect model across three generations, and correctly contrasts these with the distinct predictions of the zygotic-effect model. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Assume a single nuclear zygotic-effect locus with $D$ dominant to $d$. Perform reciprocal crosses and then self the $F_1$. Predictions: under zygotic control, reciprocal $F_1$ will differ...**\n-   The initial prediction is fundamentally flawed. It states that under zygotic control, reciprocal $F_1$ will differ. As derived above, under zygotic control with $D$ dominant, both reciprocal crosses of $DD \\times dd$ produce a uniform $F_1$ generation of dextral snails (genotype $Dd$). The option incorrectly describes the outcome of maternal-effect inheritance and attributes it to zygotic control. The rest of the option is built on this false premise. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Assume strictly cytoplasmic (organellar) inheritance of chirality. Perform reciprocal pure-line crosses and then backcross $F_1$ males to $dd$ females...**\n-   This option introduces a third model, cytoplasmic inheritance, which was not the focus of the problem statement. In cytoplasmic inheritance, the phenotype is transmitted exclusively through the maternal lineage (via the egg's cytoplasm). While reciprocal $F_1$ crosses would indeed show different phenotypes, the prediction for the backcross is incorrect. An $F_1$ male contributes no cytoplasm to the offspring. Therefore, when backcrossed to a $dd$ female, all offspring would receive cytoplasm from the $dd$ female and exhibit her line's phenotype (sinistral, assuming sinistral cytoplasm). The prediction of a $1:1$ ratio is false for cytoplasmic inheritance; this ratio is characteristic of a test cross under zygotic control. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Assume a single nuclear maternal-effect locus with $D$ dominant to $d$. Perform a single-direction cross $dd$ females $\\times$ $DD$ males... Then backcross $F_1$ females to $dd$ males...**\n-   The prediction for the $F_1$ generation is correct: $dd$ mothers produce sinistral $F_1$ offspring (genotype $Dd$).\n-   The prediction for the $F_2$ generation (from the backcross $F_1$ female $\\times$ $dd$ male) is incorrect. The mother of the $F_2$ generation is the $F_1$ female, whose genotype is $Dd$. With maternal-effect and $D$ dominant, all her offspring must be dextral. The option incorrectly predicts a $1:1$ segregation. This backcross would result in all dextral offspring under the maternal-effect model and a $1:1$ segregation of dextral:sinistral offspring under the zygotic-effect model, so the cross *can* be discriminatory, but the option's prediction for the maternal-effect outcome is wrong. **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a thorough analysis, Option A is the only one that correctly outlines an experimental design and correctly predicts the outcomes for both models, demonstrating an unambiguous method of discrimination.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2552110"}, {"introduction": "Observing and interpreting symmetry in real populations involves navigating biological variation and measurement uncertainty.
