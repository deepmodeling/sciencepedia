The colonization and extinction rates are functions of habitat connectivity $H$ and quality $Q$, given by $c(H)=c_{0}\\,H^{\\alpha}$ and $e(Q)=e_{0}\\,Q^{-\\beta}$.\n\n2) Numerical Evaluation at Baseline Conditions\n\nThe provided parameter values are: $c_{0}=0.6$, $e_{0}=0.15$, $\\alpha=1.2$, $\\beta=0.8$. The baseline habitat descriptors are $H=0.5$ and $Q=2.0$.\nFirst, we compute the colonization and extinction rates under these baseline conditions.\n$$\nc(H=0.5) = c_{0}\\,(0.5)^{\\alpha} = 0.6 \\times (0.5)^{1.2}\n$$\n$$\ne(Q=2.0) = e_{0}\\,(2.0)^{-\\beta} = 0.15 \\times (2.0)^{-0.8}\n$$\nNumerically evaluating these rates:\n$$\nc \\approx 0.6 \\times 0.435275 = 0.261165\n$$\n$$\ne \\approx 0.15 \\times 0.574349 = 0.086152\n$$\nTo determine if the metapopulation persists, we check the condition $c > e$:\n$$\n0.261165 > 0.086152\n$$\nThe condition is satisfied. The metapopulation persists under these baseline conditions.\n\nNow, we evaluate the equilibrium occupancy $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$\np^{\\ast} = 1 - \\frac{e}{c} \\approx 1 - \\frac{0.086152}{0.261165} \\approx 1 - 0.329877 \\approx 0.670123\n$$\nUnder the baseline conditions, approximately $67\\%$ of suitable patches are occupied at equilibrium.\n\n3) Elasticity of Equilibrium Occupancy\n\nThe elasticity of equilibrium occupancy $p^{\\ast}$ with respect to habitat connectivity $H$ is defined as:\n$$\nE_{H} \\equiv \\frac{\\partial \\ln p^{\\ast}}{\\partial \\ln H}\n$$\nUsing the chain rule, this can be written as $E_{H} = \\frac{H}{p^{\\ast}}\\frac{\\partial p^{\\ast}}{\\partial H}$.\nFirst, we express $p^{\\ast}$ as a function of $H$, holding $Q$ constant:\n$$\np^{\\ast}(H) = 1 - \\frac{e(Q)}{c(H)} = 1 - \\frac{e_{0}Q^{-\\beta}}{c_{0}H^{\\alpha}} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{e_{0}Q^{-\\beta}}{c_{0}}\\right) H^{-\\alpha}\n$$\nNow, we compute the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial p^{\\ast}}{\\partial H}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p^{\\ast}}{\\partial H} = -\\left(\\frac{e_{0}Q^{-\\beta}}{c_{0}}\\right) (-\\alpha H^{-\\alpha-1}) = \\alpha \\left(\\frac{e_{0}Q^{-\\beta}}{c_{0}}\\right) H^{-\\alpha-1}\n$$\nSubstitute this into the expression for elasticity:\n$$\nE_{H} = \\frac{H}{p^{\\ast}} \\left[ \\alpha \\left(\\frac{e_{0}Q^{-\\beta}}{c_{0}}\\right) H^{-\\alpha-1} \\right] = \\frac{\\alpha}{p^{\\ast}} \\left(\\frac{e_{0}Q^{-\\beta}}{c_{0}H^{\\alpha}}\\right)\n$$\nRecognizing the term in parentheses as $\\frac{e}{c}$, we have:\n$$\nE_{H} = \\frac{\\alpha}{p^{\\ast}}\\frac{e}{c}\n$$\nSince $p^{\\ast} = 1 - \\frac{e}{c}$, it follows that $\\frac{e}{c} = 1 - p^{\\ast}$. Substituting this yields a simplified expression for the elasticity:\n$$\nE_{H} = \\frac{\\alpha(1 - p^{\\ast})}{p^{\\ast}}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate $E_{H}$ numerically using the baseline values $\\alpha=1.2$ and the calculated $p^{\\ast} \\approx 0.670123$:\n$$\nE_{H} = \\frac{1.2(1 - 0.670123)}{0.670123} = \\frac{1.2(0.329877)}{0.670123} \\approx 1.2 \\times 0.49226 \\approx 0.590712\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the elasticity is $0.5907$.\n\nEcological Explanation for the Sign of the Sensitivity\n\nThe derived elasticity $E_{H}$ is positive. This is an expected and fundamental result. $E_{H}$ quantifies the proportional change in equilibrium occupancy for a proportional change in habitat connectivity. A positive sign indicates that increasing connectivity leads to an increase in the fraction of occupied patches.\nFrom a fundamental ecological perspective:\n- **Habitat**: The landscape is conceptualized as a network of habitat patches. Connectivity, $H$, is an intrinsic property of this habitat structure that dictates the ease of movement for organisms between patches.\n- **Niche and Dispersal**: The species' fundamental niche defines the conditions under which it can survive and reproduce. Dispersal is a critical life-history trait that allows a species to track its niche in space and time. Increased connectivity ($H>0$) directly facilitates this dispersal process.\n- **Colonization-Extinction Dynamics**: In the model, higher connectivity $H$ increases the colonization rate $c$ because the exponent $\\alpha$ is positive. A higher value of $c$ means empty patches are colonized more frequently. This shifts the balance of the metapopulation's dynamics, $p^{\\ast} = 1 - e/c$, in favor of occupancy. The increased flow of individuals acts as a \"rescue effect\" for patches that go extinct and a colonization source for empty patches, thereby elevating the overall proportion of the landscape that the species can stably occupy.\nTherefore, the positive sign of the sensitivity $E_{H}$ reflects the basic ecological principle that for a dispersal-limited species in a fragmented landscape, enhancing the connections between habitats directly promotes its regional persistence and abundance. A similar analysis for habitat quality $Q$ would show that increasing quality also increases occupancy by reducing the extinction rate $e$, as $e \\propto Q^{-\\beta}$ with $\\beta > 0$. Both factors, a well-connected landscape and high-quality patches, are crucial for metapopulation viability.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5907}\n$$", "id": "2575527"}]}
