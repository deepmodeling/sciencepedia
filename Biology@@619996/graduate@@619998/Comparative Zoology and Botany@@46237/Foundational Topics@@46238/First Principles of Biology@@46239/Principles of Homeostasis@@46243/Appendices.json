The baseline pH was approximately $7.40$, so the shift to $7.498$ represents a move toward a more alkaline state.\n\nThis principle of regulating an internal chemical state through controlled gas exchange has a direct analogue in plant physiology. Plants control their internal $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ concentration, a critical substrate for photosynthesis, by modulating the aperture of stomata on their leaf surfaces.
