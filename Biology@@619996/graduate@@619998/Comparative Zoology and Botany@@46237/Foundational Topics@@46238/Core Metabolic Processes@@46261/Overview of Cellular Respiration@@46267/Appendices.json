It contains all necessary information and relies on established principles of thermodynamics and electrochemistry. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the determination of the standard Gibbs free energy change per mole of electrons transferred, using only foundational definitions. The principles are as follows:\n\nFirst, the change in Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta G$, at constant temperature and pressure represents the maximum amount of non-expansion work, $w_{\\text{max, non-exp}}$, that can be extracted from a thermodynamically closed system. For a reversible process, this relationship is an equality:\n$$ \\Delta G = w_{\\text{max, non-exp}} $$\nSecond, the electrical work, $w_{\\text{elec}}$, performed by a system when an amount of charge, $q$, is transferred across an electrical potential difference, $\\Delta E$, is given by:\n$$ w_{\\text{elec}} = -q \\Delta E $$\nThe negative sign conventions indicate that for a spontaneous process where charge flows from a region of higher potential to lower potential, the system performs work on its surroundings ($w_{\\text{elec}} < 0$).\n\nIn an electrochemical process, the maximum non-expansion work is the electrical work. For the transfer of $n$ moles of electrons, the total charge is $q = nF$, where $F$ is the Faraday constant. Combining these principles gives the fundamental relationship between the Gibbs free energy change and the potential difference of the electrochemical cell:\n$$ \\Delta G = -n F \\Delta E $$\nUnder standard transformed biochemical conditions ($T = 298\\,\\text{K}$, pH $= 7$, all reactants and products at $1\\,\\text{M}$ concentration except for water and protons), this becomes:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime} = -n F \\Delta E^{\\circ \\prime} $$\nwhere $\\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}$ is the standard transformed Gibbs free energy change and $\\Delta E^{\\circ \\prime}$ is the standard transformed potential of the overall reaction.\n\nThe problem describes the transfer of electrons from NADH (the donor) to $\\text{O}_{2}$ (the acceptor). The individual half-reactions are defined by their standard transformed reduction potentials, $E^{\\circ \\prime}$. The electron donor is oxidized, and the electron acceptor is reduced. The overall potential of the reaction, $\\Delta E^{\\circ \\prime}$, is the difference between the reduction potential of the acceptor (cathode) and the reduction potential of the donor (anode).\n\n$E^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\text{acceptor}} = E^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\text{O}_{2}/\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}} = +0.82\\,\\text{V}$\n$E^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\text{donor}} = E^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\text{NAD}^{+}/\\text{NADH}} = -0.32\\,\\text{V}$\n\nThe standard potential for the overall process is calculated as follows:\n$$ \\Delta E^{\\circ \\prime} = E^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\text{acceptor}} - E^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\text{donor}} $$\n$$ \\Delta E^{\\circ \\prime} = (+0.82\\,\\text{V}) - (-0.32\\,\\text{V}) = 1.14\\,\\text{V} $$\n\nSince $\\Delta E^{\\circ \\prime} > 0$, the process is spontaneous in the direction specified (from NADH to $\\text{O}_{2}$).

Use the following well-tested foundational facts as the starting base:\n\n- Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) translocates $4$ protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space per pair of electrons delivered from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form) (NADH).\n- Complex II (succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) does not translocate protons.\n- Complex III (cytochrome $bc_{1}$ complex) operating via the quinol cycle translocates $4$ protons per pair of electrons transferred from ubiquinol to cytochrome $c$.\n- Complex IV (cytochrome $c$ oxidase) pumps $2$ protons per pair of electrons transferred to reduce dioxygen to water (vectorial pumping; do not count chemical protons used in water formation as translocated).\n- The rotary stoichiometry of the F-type adenosine triphosphate synthase ($F_1F_o$-ATP synthase) is set by the number of $c$-subunits in the membrane ring, $n_{c}$; one $360^{\\circ}$ rotation translocates $n_{c}$ protons and produces $3$ adenosine triphosphate in the catalytic head.\n- In mitochondria, inorganic phosphate ($\\mathrm{P_{i}}$) is imported into the matrix via a phosphate–proton symporter with a stoichiometry of $1$ proton per $\\mathrm{P_{i}}$ transported.\n- Ignore the energetic effect of the adenine nucleotide translocase and any other transport steps; account only for the $F_1F_o$-ATP synthase rotor and the phosphate–proton symport as coupling consumers of the proton motive force.\n\nComparative inputs:\n- For the animal mitochondrion, take $n_{c}^{\\mathrm{zoo}} = 8$.\n- For the plant mitochondrion, take $n_{c}^{\\mathrm{bot}} = 10$.\n\nTasks:\n1.

It is therefore valid, and a rigorous solution can be derived from the provided premises. The solution is developed by adhering to the principles of chemiosmotic coupling and the specific stoichiometries given for proton translocation and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three sequential steps as requested.\n\nStep 1: Derivation of the total number of protons translocated.\nThe total number of protons, $H^{+}$, translocated across the inner mitochondrial membrane per electron donor oxidized is the sum of protons pumped by the complexes of the electron transport chain involved in oxidizing that specific donor. It is given that each electron donor (NADH or succinate) transfers a pair of electrons.\n\nFor the oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH):\nElectrons enter the canonical respiratory chain at Complex I, then proceed to Complex III, and finally to Complex IV, where they reduce molecular oxygen. The total number of protons translocated per NADH molecule, denoted as $H^{+}_{\\mathrm{NADH}}$, is the sum of the protons pumped by these three complexes.\nBased on the provided stoichiometries:\n-   Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) translocates $4$ protons.\n-   Complex III (cytochrome $bc_{1}$ complex) translocates $4$ protons.\n-   Complex IV (cytochrome $c$ oxidase) translocates $2$ protons.\n\nThus, the total number of protons translocated is:\n$$H^{+}_{\\mathrm{NADH}} = (\\text{protons from C-I}) + (\\text{protons from C-III}) + (\\text{protons from C-IV})$$\n$$H^{+}_{\\mathrm{NADH}} = 4 + 4 + 2 = 10$$\n\nFor the oxidation of succinate:\nElectrons enter at Complex II (succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), which does not translocate protons. The electrons are then passed to Complex III and Complex IV. The total number of protons translocated per succinate molecule, denoted as $H^{+}_{\\mathrm{succinate}}$, is the sum of protons pumped by these subsequent complexes.\nBased on the provided stoichiometries:\n-   Complex II (succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) translocates $0$ protons.\n-   Complex III (cytochrome $bc_{1}$ complex) translocates $4$ protons.\n-   Complex IV (cytochrome $c$ oxidase) translocates $2$ protons.\n\nThus, the total number of protons translocated is:\n$$H^{+}_{\\mathrm{succinate}} = (\\text{protons from C-II}) + (\\text{protons from C-III}) + (\\text{protons from C-IV})$$\n$$H^{+}_{\\mathrm{succinate}} = 0 + 4 + 2 = 6$$\nThese values, $H^{+}_{\\mathrm{NADH}} = 10$ and $H^{+}_{\\mathrm{succinate}} = 6$, are constant for both animal and plant mitochondria under the stated canonical model.\n\nStep 2: Derivation of the proton requirement per ATP synthesized.\nThe synthesis of one molecule of ATP in the mitochondrial matrix requires a certain number of protons to be translocated back from the intermembrane space. This total cost, denoted as $h_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$, has two components as described in the problem.\n\nFirst, the $F_1F_o$-ATP synthase itself consumes protons to drive the catalytic synthesis of ATP. The problem states that the translocation of $n_{c}$ protons through the $F_{o}$ rotor drives one full $360^{\\circ}$ rotation, which in turn leads to the synthesis of $3$ molecules of ATP by the $F_{1}$ head. Therefore, the number of protons required solely for the synthesis of one ATP molecule is $\\frac{n_{c}}{3}$.\n\nSecond, the substrates for ATP synthesis must be present in the matrix. ADP is assumed to be available (as the adenine nucleotide translocase is ignored), but inorganic phosphate ($\\mathrm{P_{i}}$) must be imported. This is accomplished by a phosphate–proton symporter, which transports one proton into the matrix along with one molecule of $\\mathrm{P_{i}}$. Since one $\\mathrm{P_{i}}$ is required for each ATP molecule synthesized, this transport step adds a cost of $1$ proton per ATP.\n\nCombining these two costs, the total proton requirement per ATP synthesized is derived as:\n$$h_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = (\\text{synthesis cost}) + (\\text{transport cost}) = \\frac{n_{c}}{3} + 1$$\nThis formula is now applied to the two specific cases using their given $c$-ring stoichiometries ($n_{c}$).\n\nFor the animal mitochondrion (zoo), with $n_{c}^{\\mathrm{zoo}} = 8$:\n$$h_{\\mathrm{ATP}}^{\\mathrm{zoo}} = \\frac{8}{3} + 1 = \\frac{8}{3} + \\frac{3}{3} = \\frac{11}{3}$$\n\nFor the plant mitochondrion (bot), with $n_{c}^{\\mathrm{bot}} = 10$:\n$$h_{\\mathrm{ATP}}^{\\mathrm{bot}} = \\frac{10}{3} + 1 = \\frac{10}{3} + \\frac{3}{3} = \\frac{13}{3}$$\n\nStep 3: Calculation of the phosphorylation-to-oxidation (P/O) ratios.\nThe P/O ratio is defined as the number of ATP molecules synthesized per electron donor oxidized (NADH or succinate). It couples the proton yield from oxidation (Step 1) to the proton cost of phosphorylation (Step 2). The general formula under tight coupling is:\n$$\\mathrm{P/O} = \\frac{\\text{Total } H^{+} \\text{ translocated per donor}}{\\text{Total } H^{+} \\text{ cost per ATP}} = \\frac{H^{+}_{\\text{donor}}}{h_{\\mathrm{ATP}}}$$\n\nUsing the values derived above, we calculate the four required P/O ratios.\n\nFor the animal mitochondrion ($h_{\\mathrm{ATP}}^{\\mathrm{zoo}} = \\frac{11}{3}$):\n-   P/O ratio for NADH oxidation:\n    $$\\mathrm{P/O}_{\\mathrm{NADH}}^{\\mathrm{zoo}} = \\frac{H^{+}_{\\mathrm{NADH}}}{h_{\\mathrm{ATP}}^{\\mathrm{zoo}}} = \\frac{10}{11/3} = 10 \\times \\frac{3}{11} = \\frac{30}{11}$$\n-   P/O ratio for succinate oxidation:\n    $$\\mathrm{P/O}_{\\mathrm{succinate}}^{\\mathrm{zoo}} = \\frac{H^{+}_{\\mathrm{succinate}}}{h_{\\mathrm{ATP}}^{\\mathrm{zoo}}} = \\frac{6}{11/3} = 6 \\times \\frac{3}{11} = \\frac{18}{11}$$\n\nFor the plant mitochondrion ($h_{\\mathrm{ATP}}^{\\mathrm{bot}} = \\frac{13}{3}$):\n-   P/O ratio for NADH oxidation:\n    $$\\mathrm{P/O}_{\\mathrm{NADH}}^{\\mathrm{bot}} = \\frac{H^{+}_{\\mathrm{NADH}}}{h_{\\mathrm{ATP}}^{\\mathrm{bot}}} = \\frac{10}{13/3} = 10 \\times \\frac{3}{13} = \\frac{30}{13}$$\n-   P/O ratio for succinate oxidation:\n    $$\\mathrm{P/O}_{\\mathrm{succinate}}^{\\mathrm{bot}} = \\frac{H^{+}_{\\mathrm{succinate}}}{h_{\\mathrm{ATP}}^{\\mathrm{bot}}} = \\frac{6}{13/3} = 6 \\times \\frac{3}{13} = \\frac{18}{13}$$\n\nThe final results are collected and presented in the specified order.

There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds from the first principles of Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA). For a system of enzymes operating at a steady state, MCA defines relationships between systemic properties, such as flux control coefficients ($C_{i}^{J}$), and local properties, such as elasticities ($\\varepsilon_{i}^{X}$).\n\nA flux control coefficient, $C_{i}^{J}$, quantifies the fractional change in a steady-state flux $J$ resulting from a fractional change in the activity of enzyme $i$, while all other parameters are held constant.\nAn elasticity coefficient, $\\varepsilon_{i}^{X}$, quantifies the fractional change in the rate of an isolated enzyme reaction $v_i$ resulting from a fractional change in the concentration of a metabolite $X$, while all other variables affecting the enzyme are held constant.\n\nFor this problem, two fundamental theorems of MCA are required.\nFirst, the Flux Control Summation Theorem states that for any steady-state flux $J$, the sum of the flux control coefficients of all enzymes in the system equals one. For the two-component system described, this is written as:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{CIV}}^{J} + C_{\\mathrm{ATP}}^{J} = 1$$\nThis is our first governing equation.\n\nSecond, the Flux Control Connectivity Theorem establishes a relationship between control coefficients and elasticities for any unbranched pathway involving an intermediate metabolite. It states that the sum of the products of the flux control coefficients and their respective elasticities with respect to a non-buffered intermediate is zero. In this system, the shared, unbuffered intermediate is the proton-motive force, $\\Delta p$. Therefore, the connectivity theorem is expressed as:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{CIV}}^{J} \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{CIV}}^{\\Delta p} + C_{\\mathrm{ATP}}^{J} \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ATP}}^{\\Delta p} = 0$$\nThis is our second governing equation.\n\nThe problem provides the numerical values for the elasticities: $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{CIV}}^{\\Delta p} = -0.60$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ATP}}^{\\Delta p} = +0.80$. Substituting these values into the connectivity theorem gives:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{CIV}}^{J}(-0.60) + C_{\\mathrm{ATP}}^{J}(0.80) = 0$$\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $C_{\\mathrm{CIV}}^{J}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{ATP}}^{J}$:\n1.  $C_{\\mathrm{CIV}}^{J} + C_{\\mathrm{ATP}}^{J} = 1$\n2.  $-0.60 \\, C_{\\mathrm{CIV}}^{J} + 0.80 \\, C_{\\mathrm{ATP}}^{J} = 0$\n\nTo solve this system, we can express one variable in terms of the other using the first equation.
