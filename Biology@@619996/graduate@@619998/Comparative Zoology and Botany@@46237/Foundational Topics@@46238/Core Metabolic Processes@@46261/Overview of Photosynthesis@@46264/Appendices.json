Let the linear electron flow (LEF) portion of PSI flux be $J_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and the cyclic portion be $J_{\\mathrm{C}}$, so the total is $J = J_{\\mathrm{L}} + J_{\\mathrm{C}}$ and $f = J_{\\mathrm{C}}/J$.\n\nAt steady state with no other sinks or sources of NADPH, NADPH consumption by the CBB cycle equals NADPH production by LEF. Because $2$ electrons are required per NADPH,\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{L}} = 2\\, r_{\\mathrm{N}} = 2 \\times 63 = 126.\n$$\n\nProton translocation and ATP synthesis stoichiometries are as follows:\n- LEF moves $3$ protons per electron (PSII contributes $1$ proton per electron from water oxidation to the lumen, and cytochrome $b_{6}f$ contributes $2$ protons per electron via the $\\mathrm{Q}$-cycle).\n- CEF moves $2$ protons per electron (via cytochrome $b_{6}f$), with no NADPH production.\n- The chloroplast $\\mathrm{CF_{o}CF_{1}}$ ATP synthase requires $n_{p} = 14/3$ protons per ATP.\n\nTherefore, ATP synthesis from LEF alone at flux $J_{\\mathrm{L}}$ is\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{A,LEF}} = \\frac{3\\, J_{\\mathrm{L}}}{n_{p}} = \\frac{3 \\times 126}{14/3} = \\frac{378}{14/3} = 81,\n$$\nin agreement with the measured $r_{\\mathrm{A}}$, confirming that the measurement is consistent with LEF delivering the NADPH flux.\n\nThe CBB ATP demand associated with the measured $r_{\\mathrm{N}}$ is\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{A,req}} = \\frac{3}{2}\\, r_{\\mathrm{N}} = 1.5 \\times 63 = 94.5.\n$$\nThus, the additional ATP required beyond LEF is\n$$\n\\Delta r_{\\mathrm{A}} = r_{\\mathrm{A,req}} - r_{\\mathrm{A,LEF}} = 94.5 - 81 = 13.5.\n$$\n\nCEF produces ATP by adding protons to the gradient without producing NADPH. Each cyclic electron contributes $2$ protons, which yields\n$$\n\\text{ATP per cyclic electron} = \\frac{2}{n_{p}} = \\frac{2}{14/3} = \\frac{3}{7}.\n$$\nTherefore, the cyclic electron flux required to supply the ATP shortfall is\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{C}} = \\frac{\\Delta r_{\\mathrm{A}}}{\\text{ATP per cyclic electron}} = \\frac{13.5}{3/7} = 13.5 \\times \\frac{7}{3} = 31.5.\n$$\nThe total PSI electron flux becomes\n$$\nJ = J_{\\mathrm{L}} + J_{\\mathrm{C}} = 126 + 31.5 = 157.5,\n$$\nso the minimal fraction of PSI electrons that must be cyclic is\n$$\nf = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{C}}}{J} = \\frac{31.5}{157.5} = 0.2.\n$$\n\nRounded to $3$ significant figures as a pure number, $f = 0.200$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.200}$$", "id": "2594457"}]}
