This exercise provides direct practice in this skill, using the maximum parsimony framework to assess the fit between a character and a given topology. You will calculate the Consistency Index ($CI$), a key metric for quantifying homoplasy, and use this result to determine if a group defined by a shared trait is truly monophyletic or is instead a polyphyletic assemblage based on convergent evolution [@problem_id:2591319].", "problem": "In a comparative phylogenetic analysis across both zoological and botanical taxa, consider the rooted tree $((A,(B,C)),(D,E))$ and a single unordered binary morphological character $C_1$ that is scored as state $0$ in taxa $A$ and $D$, and state $1$ in taxa $B$, $C$, and $E$.

Do not round.", "solution": "The problem as stated is subjected to validation.\n\nStep 1: Extract Givens.\n- Rooted tree topology: `((A,(B,C)),(D,E))`\n- Character $C_1$: single, unordered, binary morphological character.\n- Character state distribution for $C_1$:\n  - Taxon `A`: state `0`.\n  - Taxon `B`: state `1`.\n  - Taxon `C`: state `1`.\n  - Taxon `D`: state `0`.\n  - Taxon `E`: state `1`.\n- Method: Character optimization under maximum parsimony.\n\nStep 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens.\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as it uses standard concepts and algorithms from the field of phylogenetic systematics, namely maximum parsimony, consistency index, and classification of organismal groups (monophyly, paraphyly, polyphyly). The problem is well-posed, providing a clearly defined tree topology, character state data for all terminal taxa, and a specified analytical method. All terms are standard and unambiguous. The setup is self-contained and consistent; there are no contradictions or missing data. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution requires three distinct components: a calculation of the consistency index for character $C_1$, a determination of whether $C_1$ is homoplasy-free, and a classification of the group of taxa exhibiting state $1$.\n\nFirst, let us represent the tree structure. The Newick format string `((A,(B,C)),(D,E))` denotes a rooted tree. We can label the internal nodes for clarity:\n- Let $n_1$ be the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of taxa `B` and `C`.\n- Let $n_2$ be the MRCA of taxon `A` and node $n_1$.\n- Let $n_3$ be the MRCA of taxa `D` and `E`.\n- Let $n_4$ be the root of the tree, the MRCA of nodes $n_2$ and $n_3$.\n\nThe primary task is to find the length ($L$) of the character $C_1$ on this tree, which is the minimum number of state changes required to explain the observed distribution of states under the principle of maximum parsimony. This is computed using the Fitch algorithm for an unordered character.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds in two passes. We require only the first pass (bottom-up) to determine the length $L$.\nLet $S(k)$ be the set of possible states for a node $k$.\n1.  Initialize state sets for the terminal taxa (leaves):\n    - $S(A) = \\{0\\}$\n    - $S(B) = \\{1\\}$\n    - $S(C) = \\{1\\}$\n    - $S(D) = \\{0\\}$\n    - $S(E) = \\{1\\}$\n2.  Traverse the tree from the leaves to the root, calculating the state sets for internal nodes. For any internal node $p$ with immediate descendants $i$ and $j$:\n    - If $S(i) \\cap S(j) \\neq \\emptyset$, then $S(p) = S(i) \\cap S(j)$.\n    - If $S(i) \\cap S(j) = \\emptyset$, then $S(p) = S(i) \\cup S(j)$, and the length $L$ is incremented by 1.\n\nLet us apply this procedure, starting with length $L=0$:\n- For node $n_1$ (descendants `B`, `C`): $S(B) = \\{1\\}$, $S(C) = \\{1\\}$. The intersection is $S(B) \\cap S(C) = \\{1\\} \\neq \\emptyset$. Thus, $S(n_1) = \\{1\\}$. The length remains $L=0$.\n- For node $n_3$ (descendants `D`, `E`): $S(D) = \\{0\\}$, $S(E) = \\{1\\}$. The intersection is $S(D) \\cap S(E) = \\emptyset$. Thus, $S(n_3) = S(D) \\cup S(E) = \\{0, 1\\}$. The length is incremented: $L = 0 + 1 = 1$.\n- For node $n_2$ (descendants `A`, $n_1$): $S(A) = \\{0\\}$, $S(n_1) = \\{1\\}$. The intersection is $S(A) \\cap S(n_1) = \\emptyset$. Thus, $S(n_2) = S(A) \\cup S(n_1) = \\{0, 1\\}$. The length is incremented again: $L = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n- For node $n_4$ (root, descendants $n_2, n_3$): $S(n_2) = \\{0, 1\\}$, $S(n_3) = \\{0, 1\\}$. The intersection $S(n_2) \\cap S(n_3) = \\{0, 1\\} \\neq \\emptyset$. Thus, $S(n_4) = \\{0, 1\\}$. The length is not incremented.\n\nThe final parsimony score, or length, is $L=2$.\n\nNext, we calculate the consistency index ($CI$). The formula is $CI = \\frac{m}{L}$, where $m$ is the minimum possible number of steps for the character, and $L$ is the observed number of steps on the tree (the parsimony score).\nThe value of $m$ is given by $s-1$, where $s$ is the number of distinct character states present in the taxa. Here, states `0` and `1` are present, so $s=2$.\nTherefore, $m = 2 - 1 = 1$.\nThe consistency index is $CI = \\frac{m}{L} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nNow, we must determine if the character $C_1$ is homoplasy-free. A character is homoplasy-free if and only if its evolution can be explained with the minimum possible number of changes, i.e., if $L=m$. This is equivalent to the condition $CI=1$.\nIn this case, $L=2$ and $m=1$. Since $L > m$, the character requires more than the minimum possible number of changes to be mapped onto the tree. Therefore, character $C_1$ is **not** homoplasy-free. It exhibits homoplasy.\n\nFinally, we classify the group of taxa that exhibit state `1`. This group is {`B`, `C`, `E`}.\n- A group is **monophyletic** if it contains an ancestor and all of its descendants.\n- A group is **paraphyletic** if it contains an ancestor but excludes one or more of its descendants.\n- A group is **polyphyletic** if its members are derived from two or more distinct ancestral lineages, and the defining character state is convergent or a symplesiomorphy (shared ancestral trait). The most recent common ancestor of a polyphyletic group is not, by definition, a member of the group. More critically in cladistics, a group defined by a homoplastic character state is polyphyletic.\n\nLet us find the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the group {`B`, `C`, `E`}. The MRCA of `B` and `C` is $n_1$. The MRCA of {`B`, `C`} and `E` is the MRCA of $n_1$ and `E`, which is the root node $n_4$.\nThe smallest clade containing all members of {`B`, `C`, `E`} is the entire tree, rooted at $n_4$, which also includes taxa `A` and `D`. Since the group {`B`, `C`, `E`} excludes taxa `A` and `D`, it is not monophyletic.\n\nThe distinction between paraphyly and polyphyly hinges on the evolutionary history of the defining character state. Our parsimony analysis has already established that character state `1` is homoplastic ($L > m$). This means that state `1` must have either arisen independently more than once (convergence) or arisen once and then been lost one or more times (reversal).\nLet us examine one of the two equally parsimonious state reconstructions. If we assign state `0` to the root $n_4$, then we must postulate a change from $0 \\to 1$ on the branch leading to node $n_1$ (to account for `B` and `C`) and another independent change from $0 \\to 1$ on the branch leading to taxon `E`.\nIn this scenario, the character state `1` in the clade (`B`,`C`) and the state `1` in taxon `E` are not homologous; they are convergent. A group whose defining character is convergent is, by definition, **polyphyletic**.\nThe members of {`B`, `C`, `E`} do not share state `1` from their immediate common ancestor ($n_4$, which is reconstructed with state `0`). The grouping is based on a non-homologous similarity. Thus, the set of taxa exhibiting state `1` is polyphyletic.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$", "id": "2591319"}, {"introduction": "While the previous exercise demonstrated a clear case of polyphyly arising from homoplasy, the evolutionary history of a character is not always so straightforward. This problem delves into the crucial concept of ambiguity in ancestral state reconstruction, where multiple, equally parsimonious scenarios can explain the observed data.

It is valid. A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe task is to determine the phylogenetic status (monophyletic, paraphyletic, or polyphyletic) of the set of taxa possessing character state $1$, which is the set $\\{A,B,C\\}$. This requires mapping the character evolution onto the provided tree topology under the principle of Maximum Parsimony.\n\nThe tree topology $(((A,B),(C,D)),E)$ can be visualized. Let us denote the internal nodes (ancestors) as follows:\n- $v_{AB} = \\text{MRCA}(A, B)$\n- $v_{CD} = \\text{MRCA}(C, D)$\n- $v_{ABCD} = \\text{MRCA}(A, B, C, D)$\n- $v_{Root} = \\text{MRCA}(A, B, C, D, E)$\n\nThe character states are $S(A)=1$, $S(B)=1$, $S(C)=1$, $S(D)=0$, $S(E)=0$.\n\n**1. Determine the Parsimony Score**\nWe use the Fitch algorithm (or equivalent logic) to find the minimum number of state changes (the parsimony score, $L$).\nThe bottom-up pass assigns a set of possible states to each internal node:\n- For $v_{AB}$, children have states $\\{1\\}$ and $\\{1\\}$. Intersection is $\\{1\\}$. State set is $\\{1\\}$.\n- For $v_{CD}$, children have states $\\{1\\}$ and $\\{0\\}$. Intersection is empty. Union is $\\{0,1\\}$. State set is $\\{0,1\\}$. This step adds $1$ to the score.\n- For $v_{ABCD}$, children are $v_{AB}$ with state set $\\{1\\}$ and $v_{CD}$ with state set $\\{0,1\\}$. Intersection is $\\{1\\}$. State set is $\\{1\\}$.\n- For $v_{Root}$, children are $v_{ABCD}$ with state set $\\{1\\}$ and $E$ with state set $\\{0\\}$. Intersection is empty. Union is $\\{0,1\\}$. State set is $\\{0,1\\}$. This step adds $1$ to the score.\n\nThe total minimum number of changes (parsimony score) is $L = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n**2. Reconstruct Ancestral States for all Most Parsimonious Reconstructions (MPRs)**\nWe need to find all assignments of states to internal nodes that result in exactly $2$ changes. The problem mandates \"outgroup polarization,\" which means the state of the outgroup, $S(E)=0$, determines the state at the root. Thus, we must set $S(v_{Root})=0$.\n\nWe now analyze the possible state assignments for the other internal nodes that are consistent with $S(v_{Root})=0$ and $L=2$.\n\n**Scenario 1: The \"Paraphyly\" Reconstruction (DELTRAN-like optimization)**\nThis scenario posits a single origin of state $1$ followed by a reversal.\n- $S(v_{Root}) = 0$.\n- For state $1$ to appear in the ingroup $\\{A,B,C,D\\}$, it must originate on the branch leading to $v_{ABCD}$. So, $S(v_{ABCD})=1$. This is change #1: $0 \\to 1$.\n- For the clade $(A,B)$, with $S(A)=1$ and $S(B)=1$, the most parsimonious assignment for their ancestor is $S(v_{AB})=1$. This involves no additional changes from its parent $v_{ABCD}$.\n- For the clade $(C,D)$, with parent $v_{ABCD}$ having state $1$, we consider $v_{CD}$. To satisfy the states of its children $S(C)=1$ and $S(D)=0$, we can set $S(v_{CD})=1$. This involves no change from its parent $v_{ABCD}$. The state $0$ in taxon $D$ must then be explained by a reversal on the terminal branch leading to $D$. This is change #2: $1 \\to 0$.\n- **Summary of MPR 1**: A single gain of state $1$ on the branch leading to $v_{ABCD}$, and a single loss (reversal) of state $1$ on the branch leading to $D$. The total number of changes is $2$.\n- **Interpretation**: The MRCA of the group $\\{A,B,C\\}$ is $v_{ABCD}$. In this reconstruction, $S(v_{ABCD})=1$. The group $\\{A,B,C\\}$ is formed from an ancestor with state $1$ ($v_{ABCD}$), but excludes one of that ancestor's descendants ($D$), which lost the character. This is the definition of a **paraphyletic** group.\n\n**Scenario 2: The \"Polyphyly\" Reconstruction (ACCTRAN-like optimization)**\nThis scenario posits multiple independent origins of state $1$.\n- $S(v_{Root}) = 0$.\n- Let us assume state $1$ does not arise on the branch leading to $v_{ABCD}$. We set $S(v_{ABCD})=0$. This involves no change from the root.\n- To explain $S(A)=1$ and $S(B)=1$, state $1$ must originate on the branch leading to their ancestor, $v_{AB}$. So, $S(v_{AB})=1$. This is change #1: $0 \\to 1$ on the branch $v_{ABCD} \\to v_{AB}$.\n- For clade $(C,D)$, its parent $v_{ABCD}$ has state $0$. We can set $S(v_{CD})=0$ to match its child $D$ and its parent. This involves no change.\n- To explain $S(C)=1$, state $1$ must originate independently on the terminal branch leading to $C$. This is change #2: $0 \\to 1$ on the branch $v_{CD} \\to C$.\n- **Summary of MPR 2**: Two independent gains (parallelisms) of state $1$: one on the branch to $v_{AB}$ and one on the branch to $C$. The total number of changes is $2$.\n- **Interpretation**: The MRCA of the group $\\{A,B,C\\}$ is $v_{ABCD}$. In this reconstruction, $S(v_{ABCD})=0$. The defining character state ($1$) is absent in the group's most recent common ancestor. The group is defined by a trait that evolved convergently. This is the definition of a **polyphyletic** group.\n\n**Conclusion of Analysis**\nThere are two equally parsimonious reconstructions, each requiring a minimum of $2$ changes. One reconstruction implies the group $\\{A,B,C\\}$ is paraphyletic. The other implies the group $\\{A,B,C\\}$ is polyphyletic. In neither case is the group monophyletic, as the full clade descended from $v_{ABCD}$ is $\\{A,B,C,D\\}$. Therefore, the phylogenetic status of the group $\\{A,B,C\\}$ is ambiguous under maximum parsimony.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The set $\\{A,B,C\\}$ is monophyletic on the given rooted tree.**\nThis is incorrect. The Most Recent Common Ancestor of $\\{A,B,C\\}$ is $v_{ABCD}$, whose complete set of descendants is $\\{A,B,C,D\\}$. The group $\\{A,B,C\\}$ excludes taxon $D$, thus it is not monophyletic.\n\n**B. The set $\\{A,B,C\\}$ is paraphyletic under all equally parsimonious reconstructions.**\nThis is incorrect. While one MPR supports paraphyly, there exists another equally parsimonious reconstruction (MPR 2) that supports polyphyly. The statement \"under all\" is false.\n\n**C. The set $\\{A,B,C\\}$ is polyphyletic under all equally parsimonious reconstructions.**\nThis is incorrect. While one MPR supports polyphyly, there exists another equally parsimonious reconstruction (MPR 1) that supports paraphyly. The statement \"under all\" is false.\n\n**D. The set $\\{A,B,C\\}$ is non-monophyletic; both paraphyly and polyphyly are possible under equally parsimonious mappings with a minimum of $2$ changes.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with our analysis.\n- The set is indeed non-monophyletic.\n- There are two equally parsimonious scenarios (MPRs), one implying paraphyly and the other polyphyly.\n- The minimum number of changes is correctly stated as $2$.\nThis option is the most accurate and complete description of the situation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2591308"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the interpretation of character data to the formal structure of phylogenies, this final practice emphasizes the axiomatic foundation of group classification.

Therefore, a set $S$ is convex if for some internal node $v$, $S=L(v_{c1})$ or $S=L(v_{c2})$.\nLet's list all such sets for each internal node of $\\mathcal{T}$:\n- For node $v_3$ (children $B,C$): The convex sets generated are $L(B)=\\{B\\}$ and $L(C)=\\{C\\}$.\n- For node $v_2$ (children $D,E$): The convex sets generated are $L(D)=\\{D\\}$ and $L(E)=\\{E\\}$.\n- For node $v_1$ (children $A,v_3$): The convex sets generated are $L(A)=\\{A\\}$ and $L(v_3)=\\{B,C\\}$.\n- For the root node $r$ (children $v_1,v_2$): The convex sets generated are $L(v_1)=\\{A,B,C\\}$ and $L(v_2)=\\{D,E\\}$.\n\nThe complete set of convex subsets, $\\mathcal{C}$, is the union of all such generated sets:\n$\\mathcal{C} = \\{\\{A\\}, \\{B\\}, \\{C\\}, \\{D\\}, \\{E\\}, \\{B,C\\}, \\{D,E\\}, \\{A,B,C\\}\\}$.\nBy definition, a set is paraphyletic if it is in $\\mathcal{C}$ but not in $\\mathcal{M}$.\nUpon inspection, every set in $\\mathcal{C}$ is a set of descendants of some node, and thus is monophyletic. Specifically, $\\mathcal{C}$ is a proper subset of $\\mathcal{M}$ (it contains all monophyletic sets except the full set $L(r)$).\nTherefore, there are no sets which are convex but not monophyletic. The set of paraphyletic subsets is empty.\nThe number of paraphyletic subsets is $P=0$.\n\n**3. Analysis of Polyphyletic Subsets ($Q$)**\nThe problem directs us to classify every non-monophyletic subset as either paraphyletic or polyphyletic.\nThe total number of non-empty subsets is $31$.\nThe number of monophyletic subsets is $M=9$.\nThe number of non-monophyletic subsets is $31 - 9 = 22$.\nThese $22$ subsets must be partitioned into paraphyletic and polyphyletic sets.\nNumber of paraphyletic subsets, $P$, is $0$.\nTherefore, all $22$ non-monophyletic subsets must be polyphyletic.\nSo, the number of polyphyletic subsets is $Q=22$.\n\nThis is consistent with the provided definition of a polyphyletic set as \"not convex\". A non-monophyletic set must be classified as polyphyletic if it is not convex. As established, any convex set is monophyletic. Consequently, any non-monophyletic set must be non-convex, and is therefore polyphyletic by definition. This confirms that all $22$ non-monophyletic sets are polyphyletic.\n\n**4. Computation of the Scalar $S$**\nWe are given the values $M=9$, $P=0$, and $Q=22$. We substitute these into the expression for $S$:\n$$ S = 3M + 5P + 7Q $$\n$$ S = 3(9) + 5(0) + 7(22) $$\n$$ S = 27 + 0 + 154 $$\n$$ S = 181 $$\nThe calculation is straightforward. The final value for $S$ is $181$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{181}\n$$", "id": "2591344"}]}
