It is a straightforward application of vector kinematics to a well-defined biophysical model. Proceeding with solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the total poleward velocity of a chromosome, $v_{\\text{chr}}$, which is observed in a laboratory reference frame (i.e., relative to the cell). This velocity is the result of two contributing processes. We are instructed to use the principle of relative velocity, which can be stated as:\n$$\nv_{\\text{chr, lab}} = v_{\\text{chr, mt}} + v_{\\text{mt, lab}}\n$$\nwhere:\n- $v_{\\text{chr, lab}}$ is the velocity of the chromosome in the lab frame. This is the quantity to be determined.\n- $v_{\\text{chr, mt}}$ is the velocity of the chromosome relative to the microtubule lattice.\n- $v_{\\text{mt, lab}}$ is the velocity of the microtubule lattice in the lab frame.\n\nThe problem provides the physical interpretations for these kinematic terms.\nThe velocity of the chromosome relative to the microtubule lattice, $v_{\\text{chr, mt}}$, is due to the shortening of the microtubule at the plus-end, where the kinetochore is attached. This is the plus-end depolymerization rate. The problem states this rate is $v_{\\text{depoly}} = 0.5\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$. Since this process moves the chromosome toward the pole, its sign is positive according to the given convention.\n$$\nv_{\\text{chr, mt}} = v_{\\text{depoly}} = +0.5\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\n$$\nThe velocity of the microtubule lattice itself in the lab frame, $v_{\\text{mt, lab}}$, is given as the poleward microtubule flux speed, $v_{\\text{flux}}$. The problem states this speed is $0.2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$. As this is a poleward movement, its sign is also positive.\n$$\nv_{\\text{mt, lab}} = v_{\\text{flux}} = +0.2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem explicitly states that the two processes act in the same direction, which confirms the additive nature of their magnitudes. The total velocity of the chromosome is therefore the sum of the magnitudes of the two component velocities.\n$$\nv_{\\text{chr, lab}} = v_{\\text{depoly}} + v_{\\text{flux}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nv_{\\text{chr, lab}} = 0.5\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1} + 0.2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1} = 0.7\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

It is a well-posed problem in kinematics applied to a biological context, free of scientific contradictions or ambiguities. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires a comparison of the time taken for cytokinesis in two idealized cell types: an animal cell and a plant cell. The analysis is based on the fundamental kinematic relation for constant velocity, which is the integral of $v = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t}$. For a constant velocity $v$, the time $\\Delta t$ required to traverse a distance $\\Delta x$ is given by the elementary formula $\\Delta t = \\frac{\\Delta x}{v}$. We will apply this principle to each case.\n\nFirst, we analyze the animal cell. Cytokinesis is modeled as the constriction of a contractile ring. The relevant physical quantity is the radius of the cleavage furrow, which we denote as $r(t)$. The initial radius is given as $r_0 = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. The furrow constricts until its radius is zero. The speed of radial decrease is a constant, $v_a = 0.3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$. The total distance the radius must change is from its initial value to its final value. Therefore, the total radial distance to be traversed is $\\Delta x_a = r_0 - 0 = r_0 = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nThe time required for completion of animal cytokinesis, $t_{\\text{animal}}$, is the total distance divided by the constant speed of constriction:\n$$t_{\\text{animal}} = \\frac{\\Delta x_a}{v_a} = \\frac{r_0}{v_a}$$\nSubstituting the provided values:\n$$t_{\\text{animal}} = \\frac{5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{0.3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}} = \\frac{5}{0.3}\\,\\mathrm{min} = \\frac{50}{3}\\,\\mathrm{min}$$\n\nNext, we analyze the plant cell. Cytokinesis proceeds via the formation of a cell plate that expands radially outwards from the center of the cell. The cell is described as having a diameter $d = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. The radius of the plant cell is therefore $R_p = \\frac{d}{2} = \\frac{10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{2} = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. The cell plate nucleates at the center (radius $0$) and expands until its edge reaches the parental plasma membrane, which is at the cell's periphery (radius $R_p$). The total distance the edge of the expanding plate must travel is $\\Delta x_p = R_p - 0 = R_p = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nThe speed of radial expansion is given as a constant, $v_p = 0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$. The time required for completion of plant cytokinesis, $t_{\\text{plant}}$, is the total distance of expansion divided by the constant speed of expansion:\n$$t_{\\text{plant}} = \\frac{\\Delta x_p}{v_p} = \\frac{R_p}{v_p}$$\nSubstituting the provided values:\n$$t_{\\text{plant}} = \\frac{5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}} = \\frac{5}{0.5}\\,\\mathrm{min} = 10\\,\\mathrm{min}$$\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the ratio $\\rho = t_{\\text{animal}}/t_{\\text{plant}}$. Using the expressions derived above:\n$$\\rho = \\frac{t_{\\text{animal}}}{t_{\\text{plant}}} = \\frac{r_0/v_a}{R_p/v_p}$$\nWe have established that $r_0 = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $R_p = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. Thus, $r_0 = R_p$. The expression for the ratio simplifies to:\n$$\\rho = \\frac{v_p}{v_a}$$\nThis is a logical result: for the same distance, the ratio of times is the inverse ratio of speeds. We substitute the numerical values for the speeds:\n$$\\rho = \\frac{0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}}{0.3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.5}{0.3} = \\frac{5}{3}$$\nThe numerical value is $\\rho \\approx 1.6666...$.

This thought experiment explores the 'point of no return' for mitotic exit by asking you to predict the consequences of blocking a critical step: the degradation of cyclin B [@problem_id:2615989]. By reasoning from the principle that high Cyclin B-Dependent Kinase (CDK) activity maintains the mitotic state, you will deduce the comparative phenotypes in animal and plant cells, revealing why the destruction of this master regulator is essential for completing division.", "problem": "A central organizing principle of eukaryotic cell-cycle control is that cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity is periodically raised and lowered to gate state transitions: high cyclin B–CDK activity is necessary to enter and maintain mitosis, while a sharp decline in this kinase activity is necessary for mitotic exit and the onset and completion of cytokinesis. This decline is normally driven by the ubiquitin ligase Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), which targets both securin and cyclin B for proteasomal degradation, thereby enabling separase activation for sister-chromatid disjunction and permitting phosphatases such as protein phosphatase $1$ (PP$1$) and protein phosphatase $2$A (PP$2$A) to reverse mitotic phosphorylations. Cytokinesis requires distinct structures and regulations in animals versus plants: animal cells utilize an actomyosin contractile ring under RhoA control and complete abscission via Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT), whereas plant cells build a new cell plate from a microtubule- and actin-rich phragmoplast guided to the division plane.\n\nYou ectopically express a cyclin B variant lacking a canonical destruction box (D-box), rendering it refractory to APC/C-dependent proteolysis (“nondegradable cyclin B”), in two systems: a cultured animal epithelial cell line and a plant root meristem.

High cyclin B–CDK activity is necessary to enter and maintain mitosis.\n2.  A sharp decline in cyclin B–CDK activity is necessary for mitotic exit, and for the onset and completion of cytokinesis.\n3.  This decline is normally driven by the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), which targets securin and cyclin B for proteasomal degradation.\n4.

Control observation: Endogenous securin is still degraded upon APC/C activation.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The statement is based on fundamental, universally accepted principles of eukaryotic cell cycle regulation. The roles of cyclin B-CDK, APC/C, securin, separase, and the general mechanics of cytokinesis in animals and plants are described accurately. The experimental design, using a nondegradable cyclin B mutant, is a classic and powerful tool in cell cycle research.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined. The initial conditions (nondegradable cyclin B present after metaphase begins, securin degradation proceeds normally) are specified, and the question asks for a predictable outcome based on these conditions. A unique solution can be derived from the provided principles.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Consistency and Completeness:** The setup is internally consistent. The crucial piece of information that securin is still degraded is provided, which prevents ambiguity about the activity state of the APC/C. This allows for a logical deduction of downstream events. The problem is self-contained and does not require external information beyond the stated principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a well-formulated question in cellular and molecular biology. The solution will now be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe experimental setup uncouples the two major functions of the APC/C at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition.\n\n1.  **APC/C Activation and Sister Chromatid Segregation:** The problem states that endogenous securin is degraded. Securin is a substrate of the APC/C. Its degradation implies that the APC/C is activated at the metaphase-anaphase transition, as it should be once the spindle assembly checkpoint is satisfied. The degradation of securin liberates the protease separase. Active separase cleaves the cohesin complexes that hold sister chromatids together. Consequently, sister chromatids will separate and move to opposite spindle poles. This means the cells, both animal and plant, will successfully enter anaphase.\n\n2.  **Consequences of Persistently High Cyclin B–CDK Activity:** The problem states that a nondegradable variant of cyclin B is expressed. This means that even though APC/C is active, cyclin B levels will not fall. Because cyclin B is the regulatory subunit of the primary mitotic kinase, CDK$1$, its persistence maintains high CDK$1$ activity. The problem explicitly states that a *decline* in this kinase activity is necessary for mitotic exit and cytokinesis. Therefore, the failure to degrade cyclin B will have two major consequences:\n\n    a. **Failure of Mitotic Exit:** Mitotic exit comprises a series of events that reverse the prophase/prometaphase transitions, including chromosome decondensation and nuclear envelope reassembly. These events are driven by the dephosphorylation of CDK substrates by phosphatases like PP$1$ and PP$2$A. High CDK activity antagonizes these phosphatases, keeping the substrates in their phosphorylated, mitotic state. As a result, chromosomes will remain condensed, and the nuclear envelope will fail to re-form around the segregated chromatids. The cells in both systems will be arrested in a late-mitotic state (anaphase/telophase).\n\n    b. **Failure of Cytokinesis:** The problem states that a decline in CDK activity is necessary for the *onset and completion* of cytokinesis. High CDK activity is known to be inhibitory to the key steps of cytokinesis in both animals and plants.\n    - In **animal cells**, high CDK activity inhibits the full activation of the RhoA pathway and the stable assembly and constriction of the actomyosin contractile ring. While some initial membrane furrowing might be observed, it is typically unstable and regresses. The final step, abscission, which involves the ESCRT machinery, is also robustly blocked by high CDK activity.\n    - In **plant cells**, cytokinesis depends on the formation, expansion, and maturation of the cell plate from the phragmoplast. This process is also negatively regulated by high CDK activity. The initiation of the phragmoplast may occur at the cell equator, but its expansion towards the cell periphery and fusion with the mother cell wall are blocked. This results in the formation of incomplete, rudimentary cell plate structures, often referred to as \"cell plate stubs.\"\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation:**\nBased on these first principles, the expected phenotype in both animal and plant cells is:\n- Successful entry into anaphase with sister chromatid separation.\n- Arrest in a late-mitotic state due to failure of mitotic exit, characterized by condensed chromosomes and no nuclear envelope reassembly.\n- Failure to complete cytokinesis, resulting in a regressing furrow in animal cells and an abortive cell plate in plant cells.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Animal cells fail to satisfy the spindle assembly checkpoint and stall in prometaphase with no cleavage furrow; plant root meristem cells complete cell plate formation because plant cytokinesis is independent of mitotic exit.**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. First, the problem implies the spindle assembly checkpoint is satisfied because securin degradation (an event downstream of checkpoint satisfaction) occurs. Thus, the arrest is not in prometaphase, but later. Second, the claim that plant cytokinesis is independent of mitotic exit (i.e., independent of CDK inactivation) is factually incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Animal cells enter anaphase but do not complete telophase or cytokinesis; transient cleavage furrow ingression may occur but regresses, with chromosomes remaining condensed and the nuclear envelope unreformed; plant root meristem cells likewise separate sister chromatids but exhibit initiation of a phragmoplast that stalls, producing abortive cell plate “stubs” and failure of nuclear reassembly and chromatin decondensation.**\nThis option aligns perfectly with our derivation. It correctly predicts:\n- Entry into anaphase (sister chromatid separation) in both systems.\n- Failure of telophase events (nuclear reassembly, chromatin decondensation) due to persistent high CDK activity in both systems.\n- Failure of cytokinesis, with specific and accurate descriptions of the resulting phenotypes: a transient/regressing furrow in the animal cell and abortive cell plate \"stubs\" from a stalled phragmoplast in the plant cell.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Animal cells complete cytokinesis and abscission but remain in mitosis with condensed chromosomes; plant root meristem cells complete phragmoplast expansion and cell plate fusion but cannot decondense chromatin, yielding cells that are physically separated yet remain mitotic.**\nThis option incorrectly claims that cytokinesis can be completed in the presence of high CDK activity. This directly contradicts a central premise given in the problem statement (\"a sharp decline in this kinase activity is necessary for ... completion of cytokinesis\").\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Animal cells skip cytokinesis and undergo mitotic slippage into the next interphase, becoming binucleate because cyclin B is stabilized; plant root meristem cells switch to endoreduplication, forming polyploid cells as cytokinesis proceeds normally but mitosis is bypassed.**\nThis option contains multiple inaccuracies. \"Mitotic slippage\" is a potential long-term fate of a cell arrested in mitosis, not the immediate phenotype, which is the arrest itself. Furthermore, slippage typically results in a single tetraploid ($4$N) nucleus, not a binucleate state. The description for plant cells is also incorrect; cytokinesis does not proceed normally, and the cell is arrested *in* mitosis, not bypassing it to switch to endoreduplication.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2615989"}]}
