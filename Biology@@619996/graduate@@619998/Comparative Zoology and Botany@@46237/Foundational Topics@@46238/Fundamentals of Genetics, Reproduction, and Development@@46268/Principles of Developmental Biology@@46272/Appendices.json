The final numerical answer must be in micrometers and rounded to four significant figures.\n\nNow, the validity of the problem is assessed.\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. It presents a standard reaction-diffusion model, which is a cornerstone of quantitative developmental biology for explaining the formation of morphogen gradients. The governing equation is a well-established linear partial differential equation. The problem is well-posed; it asks for the steady-state solution to a differential equation with physically reasonable boundary conditions, which leads to a unique functional form for the decay. The language is objective and precise. The provided parameters are physically realistic for biomolecular diffusion and degradation in a cellular context. The problem is not trivial; it requires the correct application of mathematical methods to solve a differential equation and the subsequent interpretation of the solution's parameters in a biological context. All criteria for a valid problem are met. The problem is therefore deemed valid, and I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe starting point is the governing equation for the concentration $c(x,t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c(x,t)}{\\partial t} = D\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} c(x,t)}{\\partial x^{2}} - k\\,c(x,t)\n$$\nTo find the steady-state concentration profile, we must impose the condition that the concentration no longer changes with time. Mathematically, this corresponds to setting the time derivative to zero: $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = 0$. The partial differential equation thus reduces to a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the steady-state profile $c(x)$:\n$$\n0 = D\\,\\frac{d^{2} c}{d x^{2}} - k\\,c(x)\n$$\nThis equation is conventionally rearranged into the standard form for a linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2} c}{d x^{2}} - \\frac{k}{D}c(x) = 0\n$$\nTo solve this ODE, we propose a solution of the form $c(x) = \\exp(rx)$ and substitute it into the equation, which yields the characteristic equation for the parameter $r$:\n$$\nr^{2} - \\frac{k}{D} = 0\n$$\nThe roots of this characteristic equation are $r_{1,2} = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}$. The general solution for $c(x)$ is a linear combination of the two independent solutions corresponding to these roots:\n$$\nc(x) = A\\,\\exp\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}x\\right) + B\\,\\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}x\\right)\n$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nThe problem specifies two boundary conditions. First, the concentration must remain finite as the distance from the source approaches infinity, i.e., $c(x)$ is bounded as $x \\to \\infty$. The term $A\\,\\exp\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}x\\right)$ grows without bound as $x \\to \\infty$, since both $D$ and $k$ are positive physical constants. To satisfy the condition of a finite concentration, the coefficient $A$ must be zero. This simplifies the solution to:\n$$\nc(x) = B\\,\\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}x\\right)\n$$\nThe second boundary condition pertains to the source at $x=0$. The problem states that this condition sets the amplitude of the concentration profile. We can define the concentration at the source as $c(0) = c_0$. Substituting $x=0$ into our solution gives $c(0) = B\\,\\exp(0) = B$. Thus, the constant $B$ is equal to the concentration at the source, $c_0$. The full steady-state concentration profile is:\n$$\nc(x) = c_0\\,\\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}x\\right)\n$$\nThe problem asks to identify the characteristic length scale that governs the spatial decay. The solution shows an exponential decay with distance $x$. A generic exponential decay function is written as $f(x) = f_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, where $\\lambda$ is the characteristic length scale over which the function's value decreases by a factor of $e$. By comparing our derived solution to this generic form:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-x\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)\n$$\nwe can equate the exponents and identify the characteristic length scale, $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}}\n$$\nThis length scale, often called the decay length or space constant, is determined by the ratio of the diffusion coefficient to the removal rate constant. It represents the distance over which the morphogen concentration falls to $1/e$ (approximately $37\\%$) of its value at the source.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $\\lambda$ using the provided parameters: $D = 9.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $k = 2.2 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$$\n\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{9.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{2.2 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{9.0}{2.2 \\times 10^{-4}}}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\sqrt{40909.0909...}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} \\approx 202.2600...\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as instructed:\n$$\n\\lambda \\approx 202.3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nFinally, the biological implication of this characteristic length must be explained. The length scale $\\lambda$ fundamentally constrains the physical size of a developing tissue that can be patterned by a simple morphogen gradient. For a gradient to encode positional information, cells at different positions must be able to distinguish different local morphogen concentrations. If the tissue to be patterned has a length $L$ that is much larger than $\\lambda$ (e.g., $L \\gg 3\\lambda$), the concentration will have decayed to negligible levels ($c < c_0 e^{-3} \\approx 0.05 c_0$) over the majority of the tissue. In this large-tissue regime, the gradient is too steep near the source and effectively flat (zero) far from the source, meaning most cells experience the same minimal concentration and thus cannot determine their position. Conversely, if the tissue is very small compared to $\\lambda$ ($L \\ll \\lambda$), the exponential function can be approximated as linear ($c(x) \\approx c_0(1-x/\\lambda)$), but the total change in concentration across the tissue is small, which may be difficult for cells to resolve above intrinsic biochemical noise.\n\nTherefore, this diffusion-degradation mechanism is most effective at patterning tissues with dimensions on the order of a few multiples of the characteristic length $\\lambda$. For the calculated value of $\\lambda \\approx 202.3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, this mechanism is well-suited for patterning fields of a few hundred micrometers, a scale common for structures like the root apical meristem in plants or insect imaginal discs. For much larger structures, such as a vertebrate limb bud which can be several millimeters long, a simple gradient with this decay length would be insufficient to specify position across the entire structure. This implies that larger organisms must employ more complex patterning strategies, such as reaction-diffusion networks that generate stable patterns (Turing patterns), sequential induction, signal relays where cells propagate the signal, or dynamic regulation of the parameters $D$ and $k$ to scale the gradient to the growing tissue size. The value of $\\lambda$ is thus a critical biophysical parameter that connects molecular properties ($D$, $k$) to macroscopic developmental outcomes (organ size and pattern).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{202.3}\n$$", "id": "2604622"}, {"introduction": "Establishing a gradient is only the first step in patterning; cells must then \"read\" and interpret this continuous information to make discrete fate decisions.

I will therefore proceed with a rigorous derivation of the solution.\n\nThe problem describes a one-dimensional reaction-diffusion process. The fundamental principle governing the concentration of a substance is mass conservation, which can be expressed via the continuity equation. For a one-dimensional system, the rate of change of concentration $c(x,t)$ at a point $x$ over time $t$ is given by the negative divergence of the flux $J(x,t)$ plus any local sources or sinks.\nThe problem specifies a sink due to first-order degradation, with a rate of removal equal to $k c$, and no internal production (source) for $x > 0$.
