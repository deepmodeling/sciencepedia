In both cell types, the gene is constitutively transcribed and translated under steady-state conditions with the following general features of the central dogma of molecular biology: DNA is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA), which is degraded with first-order kinetics, and mRNA is translated into protein, which is also degraded with first-order kinetics (including dilution by growth). Assume that translation initiation is rate-limiting for protein synthesis and that ribosome availability and elongation speeds are not limiting or changing.\n\nLet the transcription initiation rate be $k_{\\mathrm{tx}}$ (mRNA molecules per unit time per gene), the mRNA degradation rate constant be $\\delta_{m}$ (per unit time), the translation initiation rate per mRNA be $k_{\\mathrm{tl}}$ (proteins initiated per mRNA per unit time), and the protein degradation rate constant be $\\delta_{p}$ (per unit time).

It is a standard exercise in modeling biochemical reaction networks, specifically the central dogma of molecular biology, using ordinary differential equations under a steady-state assumption. We will now proceed with the derivation from first principles.\n\nLet $m(t)$ represent the abundance of mRNA molecules and $p(t)$ represent the abundance of protein molecules at time $t$. The problem describes the dynamics with the following assumptions: transcription occurs at a constant rate, while mRNA and protein degradation follow first-order kinetics. Translation is proportional to the amount of mRNA. This system can be described by a set of two coupled ordinary differential equations.\n\nThe rate of change of mRNA abundance is the rate of transcription minus the rate of mRNA degradation:\n$$ \\frac{dm}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{tx}} - \\delta_{m} m $$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{tx}}$ is the transcription initiation rate and $\\delta_{m}$ is the first-order degradation rate constant for mRNA.\n\nThe rate of change of protein abundance is the rate of translation minus the rate of protein degradation:\n$$ \\frac{dp}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{tl}} m - \\delta_{p} p $$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{tl}}$ is the translation initiation rate per mRNA molecule and $\\delta_{p}$ is the first-order degradation rate constant for the protein.\n\nWe are asked to find the steady-state abundance of the protein. At steady state, the concentrations of all species are constant, which implies that their time derivatives are zero.\n$$ \\frac{dm}{dt} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{dp}{dt} = 0 $$\n\nFirst, we solve for the pre-perturbation steady state. Let us denote the initial parameters with the subscript $1$: $k_{\\mathrm{tx}}$, $\\delta_{m,1}$, $k_{\\mathrm{tl},1}$, and $\\delta_{p}$. The steady-state abundances are $m_{ss,1}$ and $p_{ss,1}$.\n\nFrom the mRNA dynamics equation at steady state:\n$$ 0 = k_{\\mathrm{tx}} - \\delta_{m,1} m_{ss,1} $$\nSolving for the steady-state mRNA abundance, $m_{ss,1}$:\n$$ m_{ss,1} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tx}}}{\\delta_{m,1}} $$\n\nNow, using the protein dynamics equation at steady state:\n$$ 0 = k_{\\mathrm{tl},1} m_{ss,1} - \\delta_{p} p_{ss,1} $$\nSolving for the steady-state protein abundance, $p_{ss,1}$, and substituting the expression for $m_{ss,1}$:\n$$ p_{ss,1} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tl},1} m_{ss,1}}{\\delta_{p}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tl},1}}{\\delta_{p}} \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tx}}}{\\delta_{m,1}} \\right) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tx}} k_{\\mathrm{tl},1}}{\\delta_{m,1} \\delta_{p}} $$\nThis is the expression for the protein abundance before the perturbation.\n\nNext, we analyze the system after the regulatory perturbation. Let the new parameters be denoted with a subscript $2$. The problem states:\n$1$. The transcription rate $k_{\\mathrm{tx}}$ is constant, so $k_{\\mathrm{tx},2} = k_{\\mathrm{tx}}$.\n$2$. The protein degradation rate $\\delta_{p}$ is constant, so $\\delta_{p,2} = \\delta_{p}$.\n$3$. The translation initiation rate is halved, so $k_{\\mathrm{tl},2} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tl},1}}{2}$.\n$4$. The mRNA half-life is doubled. The initial half-life is $\\tau_{m,1} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\delta_{m,1}}$. The new half-life is $\\tau_{m,2} = 2\\tau_{m,1}$.\n\nWe must find the new mRNA degradation rate constant, $\\delta_{m,2}$, from the new half-life:\n$$ \\tau_{m,2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\delta_{m,2}} $$\nSubstituting the relation $\\tau_{m,2} = 2\\tau_{m,1}$:\n$$ 2\\tau_{m,1} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\delta_{m,2}} $$\n$$ 2 \\left( \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\delta_{m,1}} \\right) = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\delta_{m,2}} $$\n$$ \\frac{2}{\\delta_{m,1}} = \\frac{1}{\\delta_{m,2}} $$\n$$ \\delta_{m,2} = \\frac{\\delta_{m,1}}{2} $$\nThus, doubling the mRNA half-life corresponds to halving its degradation rate constant.\n\nNow, we solve for the post-perturbation steady-state protein abundance, $p_{ss,2}$. The form of the steady-state solution is the same, but with the new parameters:\n$$ p_{ss,2} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tx},2} k_{\\mathrm{tl},2}}{\\delta_{m,2} \\delta_{p,2}} $$\nSubstituting the post-perturbation parameter values:\n$$ p_{ss,2} = \\frac{(k_{\\mathrm{tx}}) \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tl},1}}{2} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{\\delta_{m,1}}{2} \\right) (\\delta_{p})} $$\nThe factors of $\\frac{1}{2}$ in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n$$ p_{ss,2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{tx}} k_{\\mathrm{tl},1}}{\\frac{1}{2} \\delta_{m,1} \\delta_{p}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tx}} k_{\\mathrm{tl},1}}{\\delta_{m,1} \\delta_{p}} $$\nComparing this result to the pre-perturbation abundance, we find:\n$$ p_{ss,2} = p_{ss,1} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the fold-change in steady-state protein output, which is defined as the ratio $\\frac{p_{ss,2}}{p_{ss,1}}$.\n$$ \\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{p_{ss,2}}{p_{ss,1}} = \\frac{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tx}} k_{\\mathrm{tl},1}}{\\delta_{m,1} \\delta_{p}}}{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tx}} k_{\\mathrm{tl},1}}{\\delta_{m,1} \\delta_{p}}} $$\nSince the numerator and the denominator are identical, their ratio is $1$. The halving of the translation rate per mRNA molecule is perfectly compensated by the doubling of the steady-state mRNA abundance, which results from the halving of the mRNA degradation rate.

A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe dynamics of the protein concentration, $P(t)$, are described by a first-order ordinary differential equation which states that the rate of change of protein abundance is the difference between its synthesis rate and its degradation rate.\n$$\n\\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of Synthesis}) - (\\text{Rate of Degradation})\n$$\nThe synthesis rate is given as a constant, $k_s$. The degradation rate is given as a first-order process, meaning it is proportional to the current protein abundance, $P(t)$, with a rate constant.\n\nFirst, we must determine the initial condition, which is the protein abundance at $t=0$. The problem states that for $t < 0$, the system is at steady state. At steady state, the protein concentration does not change, so $\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0$. The degradation rate constant during this period is $\\delta$. The steady-state equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = k_s - \\delta P_{ss} = 0\n$$\nwhere $P_{ss}$ is the steady-state protein abundance. Solving for $P_{ss}$ gives the initial condition for our problem at $t=0$:\n$$\nP(0) = P_{ss} = \\frac{k_s}{\\delta}\n$$\nFor time $t \\geq 0$, a proteasome inhibitor is applied, which changes the degradation rate constant to $\\delta/4$. The synthesis rate $k_s$ remains unchanged. The governing differential equation for $t \\geq 0$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = k_s - \\frac{\\delta}{4} P(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation. We can rearrange it into the standard form:\n$$\n\\frac{dP(t)}{dt} + \\frac{\\delta}{4} P(t) = k_s\n$$\nThis equation is to be solved with the initial condition $P(0) = k_s / \\delta$.\n\nThe general solution $P(t)$ is the sum of the homogeneous solution $P_h(t)$ and a particular solution $P_p(t)$.\n\n1.  **Homogeneous Solution:**\n    The homogeneous equation is $\\frac{dP_h(t)}{dt} + \\frac{\\delta}{4} P_h(t) = 0$.
