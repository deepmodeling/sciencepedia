In a flowering plant, a triple heterozygote with phase $ABC/abc$ is testcrossed to a triple recessive $abc/abc$. Under the standard assumptions for a three-point testcross in eukaryotes—namely, that each scored progeny reflects a single meiotic product, that there is no chromatid interference, and that the most frequent classes are nonrecombinants—progeny are classified into eight genotypic classes corresponding to chromatids recovered. The observed counts are as follows (each genotype is written as the recovered chromatid): $ABC$: $815$, $abc$: $815$, $Abc$: $114$, $aBC$: $114$, $ABc$: $66$, $abC$: $66$, $AbC$: $5$, $aBc$: $5$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Mendelian and molecular genetics, specifically gene mapping via testcross analysis. All necessary data are provided, and they are internally consistent (the sum of individual progeny counts is $815+815+114+114+66+66+5+5 = 2000$, which matches the specified total sample size). The problem is well-posed, objective, and requires application of standard, formalizable genetic logic. There are no logical contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe solution proceeds by executing the four tasks specified in the problem statement.\n\n**1. Inference of Gene Order**\n\nThe gene order is inferred by identifying the parental (non-recombinant, NCO) and double-crossover (DCO) classes from the progeny counts.\n-   The parental classes are the most frequent. From the data, these are $ABC$ (count of $815$) and $abc$ (count of $815$). This confirms the parental linkage phase is $ABC/abc$. The total number of non-recombinant progeny is $N_{NCO} = 815 + 815 = 1630$.\n-   The double-crossover (DCO) classes are the least frequent. These are $AbC$ (count of $5$) and $aBc$ (count of $5$). The total number of DCO progeny is $N_{DCO} = 5 + 5 = 10$.\n-   To determine the middle gene, we compare a parental genotype with a DCO genotype. For example, comparing the parental genotype $ABC$ with the DCO genotype $AbC$, the alleles for genes $A$ and $C$ are the same ($A$ and $C$), while the allele for gene $B$ is different ($B$ vs $b$). The gene whose allele is switched relative to the flanking markers is the gene in the middle. Therefore, the gene order is $A-B-C$.\n\n**2. Computation of Recombination Fractions**\n\nWith the gene order established as $A-B-C$, the remaining progeny classes must be single crossovers (SCO).\n-   Single crossovers in Interval $1$ (between gene $A$ and gene $B$) would produce the genotypes $Abc$ and $aBC$. The counts for these classes are $114$ and $114$, respectively. The total number of SCO progeny in Interval $1$ is $N_{SCO1} = 114 + 114 = 228$.\n-   Single crossovers in Interval $2$ (between gene $B$ and gene $C$) would produce the genotypes $ABc$ and $abC$. The counts for these classes are $66$ and $66$, respectively. The total number of SCO progeny in Interval $2$ is $N_{SCO2} = 66 + 66 = 132$.\n-   A consistency check confirms the total progeny: $N = N_{NCO} + N_{SCO1} + N_{SCO2} + N_{DCO} = 1630 + 228 + 132 + 10 = 2000$.\n\nThe recombination fraction ($RF$) for an interval is the frequency of all recombinant events (both SCO and DCO) occurring within that interval.\n-   The recombination fraction for Interval $1$ ($RF_{A-B}$) is:\n$$RF_{A-B} = \\frac{N_{SCO1} + N_{DCO}}{N} = \\frac{228 + 10}{2000} = \\frac{238}{2000} = 0.119$$\n-   The recombination fraction for Interval $2$ ($RF_{B-C}$) is:\n$$RF_{B-C} = \\frac{N_{SCO2} + N_{DCO}}{N} = \\frac{132 + 10}{2000} = \\frac{142}{2000} = 0.071$$\n\n**3. Derivation of Expected Double-Crossover Frequency**\n\nAssuming no interference, the formation of a crossover in one interval is independent of the formation of a crossover in the adjacent interval. Therefore, the expected frequency of double crossovers ($DCO_{exp}$) is the product of the recombination frequencies of the two intervals.\n$$DCO_{exp} = RF_{A-B} \\times RF_{B-C}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$DCO_{exp} = 0.119 \\times 0.071 = 0.008449$$\nThe problem requires this answer as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.008449$ already has exactly four significant figures ($8, 4, 4, 9$). Thus, no further rounding is required.\n\n**4. Computation of Coefficient of Coincidence and Interference**\n\nFor completeness, we compute the coefficient of coincidence ($C$) and interference ($I$).\n-   The observed double-crossover frequency ($DCO_{obs}$) is:\n$$DCO_{obs} = \\frac{N_{DCO}}{N} = \\frac{10}{2000} = 0.005$$\n-   The coefficient of coincidence is the ratio of observed to expected DCO frequencies:\n$$C = \\frac{DCO_{obs}}{DCO_{exp}} = \\frac{0.005}{0.008449} \\approx 0.591786$$\n-   Interference is defined as $I = 1 - C$:\n$$I = 1 - 0.591786 = 0.408214$$\nThe positive interference value ($I \\approx 0.41$) indicates that a crossover in one region reduces the probability of a second crossover nearby, which is a common biological observation.\n\nThe final answer required is the expected double-crossover frequency from part $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.008449}$$", "id": "2589222"}, {"introduction": "While meiosis is a remarkably precise process, errors in chromosome segregation can and do occur, often with profound consequences. Nondisjunction—the failure of homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids to separate—is a primary source of aneuploidy, a condition central to many genetic disorders and a significant factor in evolution. This practice [@problem_id:2589204] challenges you to trace the chromosomal fate through a meiotic division with a specific error, deriving from first principles the impact of a meiosis I nondisjunction event on the resulting gametes.", "problem": "In a diploid organism with haploid number $n$ (that is, with $n$ homologous chromosome pairs forming $n$ bivalents at meiosis), consider a single meiotic division in which exactly one bivalent undergoes nondisjunction during meiosis I (MI), while all other bivalents segregate normally at MI and all sister chromatids separate normally during meiosis II (MII). Crossing over, if it occurs, does not prevent both homologous chromosomes of the nondisjoining bivalent from migrating to the same pole at MI. Define a gamete as aneuploid if its chromosome count deviates from the haploid number $n$ (that is, it is either $n+1$ or $n-1$). Assume random mating at fertilization, so that the partner gamete is independent of the meiotic products considered.\n\nStarting from the core definitions of MI versus MII segregation and the definition of aneuploidy, derive the expected frequency of aneuploid gametes among the four products of this meiosis. Express your final answer as a closed-form expression in terms of $n$. No numerical approximation is required, and no units are needed.", "solution": "The problem statement has been analyzed and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, describing a canonical scenario of meiotic nondisjunction. We shall proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nLet the diploid organism have a chromosome number of $2n$, consisting of $n$ homologous pairs. Before the onset of meiosis, each of the $2n$ chromosomes replicates, so the cell entering meiosis I contains $2n$ chromosomes, each composed of two sister chromatids. These chromosomes pair up to form $n$ bivalents.\n\nThe problem specifies two key events:\n$1$. Exactly one bivalent undergoes nondisjunction during meiosis I (MI). This means that instead of separating, both homologous chromosomes of this single pair migrate to the same pole during anaphase I.\n$2$. The remaining $n-1$ bivalents segregate normally. This means for each of these pairs, the homologous chromosomes separate and migrate to opposite poles.\n$3$. Meiosis II (MII), the separation of sister chromatids, proceeds normally for all chromosomes in both daughter cells from MI.\n\nLet us trace the chromosome content through the two meiotic divisions.\n\nDuring Meiosis I:\nThe $n-1$ normally segregating bivalents will distribute one homologous chromosome (each replicated) to each of the two forming daughter cells.\nThe single bivalent undergoing nondisjunction will send both of its homologous chromosomes (both replicated) to one daughter cell, and none to the other.\n\nAs a result of telophase I and cytokinesis, two secondary meiocytes are formed with unequal chromosome numbers:\n- **Secondary Meiocyte 1**: This cell receives one chromosome from each of the $n-1$ normally segregating pairs, plus both homologous chromosomes from the nondisjoining pair. The total number of chromosomes in this cell is $(n-1) + 2 = n+1$. Each of these $n+1$ chromosomes is still in its replicated state (composed of two sister chromatids).\n- **Secondary Meiocyte 2**: This cell receives one chromosome from each of the $n-1$ normally segregating pairs, but zero chromosomes from the nondisjoining pair. The total number of chromosomes in this cell is $(n-1) + 0 = n-1$. Each of these $n-1$ chromosomes is also in its replicated state.\n\nDuring Meiosis II:\nThe problem states that MII proceeds normally. In MII, sister chromatids separate.\n\n- The division of **Secondary Meiocyte 1** (containing $n+1$ chromosomes) will produce two daughter cells, which are the final gametes. Since sister chromatid separation is normal, each of the $n+1$ chromosomes will yield one chromatid to each gamete. Thus, both gametes produced from this cell will have a chromosome count of $n+1$. These are referred to as $(n+1)$ or disomic gametes (disomic for the chromosome that underwent nondisjunction).\n- The division of **Secondary Meiocyte 2** (containing $n-1$ chromosomes) will also produce two gametes. Normal separation of sister chromatids means that each of the $n-1$ chromosomes will contribute one chromatid to each gamete. Thus, both gametes produced from this cell will have a chromosome count of $n-1$. These are referred to as $(n-1)$ or nullisomic gametes (nullisomic for the chromosome that underwent nondisjunction).\n\nIn summary, the four meiotic products (gametes) resulting from this single meiotic event are:\n- Two gametes with chromosome count $n+1$.\n- Two gametes with chromosome count $n-1$.\n\nThe problem defines an aneuploid gamete as one whose chromosome count deviates from the normal haploid number, $n$.\n- A gamete with count $n+1$ is aneuploid because $n+1 \\neq n$.\n- A gamete with count $n-1$ is aneuploid because $n-1 \\neq n$ (for any biologically relevant case where $n \\ge 1$).\n\nTherefore, all four gametes produced under these specific conditions are aneuploid.\n\nThe expected frequency of aneuploid gametes among the four products is the ratio of the number of aneuploid gametes to the total number of gametes.\nNumber of aneuploid gametes $= 2 (\\text{from } n+1) + 2 (\\text{from } n-1) = 4$.\nTotal number of gametes produced $= 4$.\n\nThe frequency is $\\frac{4}{4} = 1$.\n\nThis result, a frequency of $1$, indicates that $100\\%$ of the gametes are aneuploid. This result is a constant and thus is a valid closed-form expression in terms of $n$, as its derivation is based on a process defined for a general haploid number $n$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2589204"}, {"introduction": "Genetic variation is not only generated by the gross mechanics of segregation and crossing over but is also shaped by subtle molecular-level processes with significant long-term evolutionary consequences. GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) is a fascinating example, where a bias in the DNA mismatch repair system during meiotic recombination can drive genome-wide changes in base composition over evolutionary time. In this advanced exercise [@problem_id:2589173], you will develop a mathematical model that links this molecular mechanism to population-level dynamics, deriving the expected substitution rate bias and appreciating how recombination can act as a directed evolutionary force.", "problem": "Meiotic recombination in eukaryotes generates nascent heteroduplex DNA in which base-pair mismatches can occur at sites that are heterozygous in the meiocyte. A widely observed phenomenon is GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC), in which, when a mismatch involves a weak base (adenine or thymine, denoted $W$) paired to a strong base (guanine or cytosine, denoted $S$), the DNA mismatch repair system resolves the mismatch so that the transmitted allele is more likely to be $S$ than $W$. Assume the following fundamental base for modeling this process in a single, biallelic site embedded in a genomic region:\n\n- In a diploid, randomly mating population of effective size $N_e$ evolving under the Wright–Fisher model, new mutations arise at a symmetric per-site rate, so that the mutation rate from $W \\to S$ equals that from $S \\to W$; call each of these rates $\\mu$.\n- Recombination initiations occur along the genome as a homogeneous Poisson process with rate $r$ per base per meiosis in a recombining region, and with rate $0$ in a nonrecombining region. Each recombination initiation yields a single gene conversion tract of mean length $\\ell$ bases. Assume tracts are short and sparse so that the per-meiosis probability that a given focal site lies inside a tract equals $g = r \\ell$ in the recombining region and $g = 0$ otherwise, and that at most one tract covers the focal site per meiosis.\n- Conditional on the focal site being heterozygous in a meiocyte and lying in a tract, the mismatch repair resolves a $W/S$ heteroduplex in favor of $S$ with probability $\\tfrac{1}{2} + b$ and in favor of $W$ with probability $\\tfrac{1}{2} - b$, where $b \\in [0, \\tfrac{1}{2})$ is the GC-bias parameter. Outside of conversion tracts, alleles segregate according to Mendelian fairness.\n\nUsing only these modeling ingredients and standard diffusion results for fixation probabilities under genic selection in the Wright–Fisher model, derive, from first principles, an analytic expression for the ratio of substitution rates of $W \\to S$ to $S \\to W$ driven solely by GC-biased gene conversion in:\n\n(i) a recombining region with recombination rate $r > 0$, and\n\n(ii) a nonrecombining region with recombination rate $r = 0$.\n\nExpress your final answer as a closed-form expression depending on $b$, $N_e$, $r$, and $\\ell$, in the form of a row matrix with the first entry corresponding to the recombining region and the second entry to the nonrecombining region. No numerical evaluation is required. No units are required because the ratio is dimensionless. The final answer must be a single analytic expression; do not present an inequality or an equation.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the ratio of substitution rates, $K_{W \\to S} / K_{S \\to W}$, under a model of G-C biased gene conversion (gBGC). This ratio depends on the respective fixation probabilities of a new $S$ allele in a $W$ population and a new $W$ allele in an $S$ population. The gBGC process introduces a bias that can be modeled as an effective selection coefficient, $s_{eff}$. We will first derive this coefficient from the given premises and then use standard diffusion theory results for fixation probabilities to find the required ratio.\n\nThe overall rate of substitution of a new allele is given by Kimura's formula $K = 2N_e \\mu P_{\\text{fix}}$, where $N_e$ is the effective population size, $\\mu$ is the per-site mutation rate to the new allele, and $P_{\\text{fix}}$ is the probability that a single new mutation goes to fixation. The problem states that mutation rates are symmetric, $\\mu_{W \\to S} = \\mu_{S \\to W} = \\mu$. Therefore, the ratio of substitution rates simplifies to the ratio of fixation probabilities:\n$$ \\frac{K_{W \\to S}}{K_{S \\to W}} = \\frac{2N_e \\mu P_{fix}(S \\text{ in } W)}{2N_e \\mu P_{fix}(W \\text{ in } S)} = \\frac{P_{fix}(S \\text{ in } W)}{P_{fix}(W \\text{ in } S)} $$\n\nThe core of the problem is to quantify the effect of gBGC as a form of genic selection. Let $p$ be the frequency of the $S$ allele in the population. In a randomly mating population, the genotype frequencies for $WW$, $WS$, and $SS$ are $(1-p)^2$, $2p(1-p)$, and $p^2$, respectively.\n\nThe gBGC process acts during meiosis in heterozygous individuals ($WS$). According to the problem statement, a focal site lies within a gene conversion tract with probability $g = r\\ell$. Outside a tract (with probability $1-g$), segregation is Mendelian, so a $WS$ heterozygote produces $S$ and $W$ gametes in equal proportion ($1/2$). Inside a tract, the resolution of the $W/S$ heteroduplex is biased, such that the transmitted allele is $S$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2} + b$. This is interpreted as the conditional probability of transmitting an $S$ allele from a heterozygote, given the site is in a conversion tract.\n\nLet $k$ be the overall probability that a gamete produced by a $WS$ heterozygote carries the $S$ allele. We can express $k$ as the weighted average over the two cases (inside or outside a tract):\n$$ k = (1-g) \\times \\frac{1}{2} + g \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2} + b\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{g}{2} + \\frac{g}{2} + gb = \\frac{1}{2} + gb $$\nThe frequency of the $S$ allele in the next generation, $p'$, is determined by the gametes produced by each genotype. $SS$ individuals produce only $S$ gametes, and $WS$ heterozygotes produce a fraction $k$ of $S$ gametes.\n$$ p' = 1 \\cdot p^2 + k \\cdot 2p(1-p) + 0 \\cdot (1-p)^2 = p^2 + 2p(1-p)k $$\nSubstituting the expression for $k$:\n$$ p' = p^2 + 2p(1-p)\\left(\\frac{1}{2} + gb\\right) = p^2 + p(1-p) + 2gb p(1-p) = p + 2gb p(1-p) $$\nThe change in allele frequency in one generation due to gBGC is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta p = p' - p = 2gb p(1-p) $$\nWe are instructed to use standard diffusion results for genic selection. A standard model for genic selection assumes that the change in allele frequency is of the form $\\Delta p \\approx s p(1-p)$. By comparing this with our derived expression for $\\Delta p$, we identify the effective selection coefficient, $s_{\\text{eff}}$, favoring the $S$ allele:\n$$ s_{\\text{eff}} = 2gb = 2br\\ell $$\nThis selective pressure favors the $S$ allele ($s_{\\text{eff}} > 0$ for $b, r, \\ell > 0$) and disfavors the $W$ allele. Thus, for a $W \\to S$ substitution, the selection coefficient is $s_{\\text{eff}}$, and for an $S \\to W$ substitution, the selection coefficient is $-s_{\\text{eff}}$.\n\nNow we employ the standard diffusion theory result for the fixation probability of a new mutation in a diploid population of effective size $N_e$. For a mutation with selection coefficient $s$ and initial frequency $p_0$, the fixation probability is given by:\n$$ P_{fix}(p_0, s) = \\frac{\\int_0^{p_0} \\exp(-4N_e s x) dx}{\\int_0^1 \\exp(-4N_e s x) dx} $$\nA single new mutation in a population of $N_e$ diploid individuals has an initial frequency $p_0 = \\frac{1}{2N_e}$. Evaluating the integrals, we obtain:\n$$ P_{\\text{fix}}(s) = \\frac{[- \\frac{1}{4N_e s} \\exp(-4N_e s x)]_0^{1/(2N_e)}}{[- \\frac{1}{4N_e s} \\exp(-4N_e s x)]_0^1} = \\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(-4N_e s \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right)}{1 - \\exp(-4N_e s)} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-2s)}{1 - \\exp(-4N_e s)} $$\nWe can now calculate the ratio of substitution rates:\n$$ \\frac{K_{W \\to S}}{K_{S \\to W}} = \\frac{P_{fix}(s_{eff})}{P_{fix}(-s_{eff})} = \\frac{\\frac{1 - \\exp(-2s_{eff})}{1 - \\exp(-4N_e s_{eff})}}{\\frac{1 - \\exp(2s_{eff})}{1 - \\exp(4N_e s_{eff})}} $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{K_{W \\to S}}{K_{S \\to W}} = \\exp(s_{\\text{eff}}(4N_e - 2)) $$\nFinally, we substitute $s_{\\text{eff}} = 2br\\ell$:\n$$ \\frac{K_{W \\to S}}{K_{S \\to W}} = \\exp(2br\\ell(4N_e - 2)) = \\exp(4br\\ell(2N_e-1)) $$\n\nWe now apply this general result to the two specific cases required.\n\n(i) In a recombining region with $r > 0$:\nThe probability of a gene conversion event is $g = r\\ell > 0$. The derived ratio holds directly:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\exp(4br\\ell(2N_e-1)) $$\n\n(ii) In a nonrecombining region with $r = 0$:\nThe probability of a gene conversion event is $g = r\\ell = 0$. Consequently, the effective selection coefficient $s_{\\text{eff}} = 2b(0)\\ell = 0$. The alleles are selectively neutral. Substituting $r=0$ into our expression for the ratio:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\exp(4b(0)\\ell(2N_e-1)) = \\exp(0) = 1 $$\nThis result is expected, as in the absence of recombination, there are no gene conversion tracts, no gBGC, and thus no selective difference between $S$ and $W$ alleles. The substitution process is governed by neutral mutation rates, which are symmetric, leading to a ratio of $1$.\n\nThe final answer is presented as a row matrix with the results for the recombining and nonrecombining regions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\pmatrix{\n\\exp(4br\\ell(2N_e-1)) & 1\n}\n}\n$$", "id": "2589173"}]}
