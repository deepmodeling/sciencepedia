The physical values provided ($R$, $\\Delta n_{\\mathrm{air}}$, $\\Delta n_{\\mathrm{water}}$) are realistic for a biological system (specifically, a human-like eye). The problem does not violate any criteria for invalidity; it is not unsound, incomplete, ambiguous, or trivial. It is a standard problem in biophysical optics that directly addresses the specified topic of convergent evolution.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\nWe begin by deriving the paraxial refraction equation for a single spherical surface. Consider a spherical interface with radius of curvature $R$ separating two media with refractive indices $n_1$ and $n_2$. An object point $O$ on the principal axis is at an object distance $s_o$ from the vertex of the surface. A ray from $O$ strikes the surface at a point $P$ at a height $h$ above the axis. After refraction, the ray intersects the principal axis at the image point $I$, at an image distance $s_i$ from the vertex.\n\nLet $\\theta_1$ be the angle of incidence and $\\theta_2$ be the angle of refraction. Let $\\alpha_o$ be the angle the incident ray makes with the axis, $\\alpha_i$ be the angle the refracted ray makes with the axis, and $\\phi$ be the angle that the normal to the surface at $P$ makes with the axis. From the geometry of the setup, using the exterior angle theorem on the relevant triangles, we have:\n$\\theta_1 = \\alpha_o + \\phi$\n$\\phi = \\theta_2 + \\alpha_i \\implies \\theta_2 = \\phi - \\alpha_i$\n\nSnell's Law is given as $n_{1}\\sin\\theta_{1} = n_{2}\\sin\\theta_{2}$. Under the paraxial (small-angle) approximation, we can state that $\\sin x \\approx x$ for any small angle $x$ in radians. Thus, Snell's Law becomes:\n$n_1 \\theta_1 = n_2 \\theta_2$\n\nSubstituting the geometric relations for the angles yields:\n$n_1 (\\alpha_o + \\phi) = n_2 (\\phi - \\alpha_i)$\n\nAlso, under the paraxial approximation, we can relate the angles $\\alpha_o$, $\\alpha_i$, and $\\phi$ to the distances $s_o$, $s_i$, $R$, and the height $h$:\n$\\alpha_o \\approx \\tan(\\alpha_o) = \\frac{h}{s_o}$\n$\\alpha_i \\approx \\tan(\\alpha_i) = \\frac{h}{s_i}$\n$\\phi \\approx \\sin(\\phi) = \\frac{h}{R}$\nHere we adopt the sign convention that light travels from left to right, and a convex surface has a positive radius of curvature.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the approximated Snell's Law:\n$n_1 \\left(\\frac{h}{s_o} + \\frac{h}{R}\\right) = n_2 \\left(\\frac{h}{R} - \\frac{h}{s_i}\\right)$\n\nFor any non-trivial ray ($h \\neq 0$), we can divide by $h$:\n$n_1 \\left(\\frac{1}{s_o} + \\frac{1}{R}\\right) = n_2 \\left(\\frac{1}{R} - \\frac{h}{s_i}\\right)$\n\nRearranging the terms to group object/image and surface properties, we get:\n$\\frac{n_1}{s_o} + \\frac{n_2}{s_i} = \\frac{n_2 - n_1}{R}$\n\nThis is the paraxial refraction equation. The terms $\\frac{n_1}{s_o}$ and $\\frac{n_2}{s_i}$ are the object and image vergences, respectively.\n\nThe refracting power, or surface power $P$, of a surface is defined as its ability to converge parallel rays of light. For parallel incident rays, the object is at infinity, so $s_o \\to \\infty$. The equation simplifies to:\n$\\frac{n_2}{s_i} = \\frac{n_2 - n_1}{R}$\nThe power $P$ is precisely this quantity, representing the vergence added to the light by the surface.\n$P = \\frac{n_2 - n_1}{R}$\n\nThis expression directly justifies that the surface power $P$ is proportional to the difference in refractive indices, $\\Delta n = n_2 - n_1$, and the curvature of the surface, $C = \\frac{1}{R}$. So, $P = \\Delta n \\cdot C$. This completes the required justification.\n\nNow, we quantify the underwater corneal surface power. The problem provides the necessary values for this case. The cornea (medium $2$) is immersed in water (medium $1$).\nThe refractive index difference is given as $\\Delta n_{\\mathrm{water}} = n_{\\mathrm{cornea}} - n_{\\mathrm{water}} \\approx 0.05$.\nThe anterior corneal radius of curvature is given as $R = 7.8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nTo calculate power in diopters ($D$), which are units of inverse meters ($\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$), we must express the radius of curvature in meters:\n$R = 7.8\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 7.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nNow, we apply the surface power formula:\n$P_{\\mathrm{water}} = \\frac{\\Delta n_{\\mathrm{water}}}{R}$\n$P_{\\mathrm{water}} = \\frac{0.05}{7.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}}$\n\nThis calculation yields:\n$P_{\\mathrm{water}} = \\frac{0.05}{0.0078}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} \\approx 6.410256... \\, D$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$P_{\\mathrm{water}} \\approx 6.41 \\, D$\n\nFor context, which is not required for the final answer, the power in air would be:\n$P_{\\mathrm{air}} = \\frac{\\Delta n_{\\mathrm{air}}}{R} = \\frac{0.33}{7.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 42.3 \\, D$\nThe ratio of underwater power to in-air power is $\\frac{6.41}{42.3} \\approx 0.15$, demonstrating the profound loss of corneal refractive power in an aquatic medium. This physical constraint necessitates the evolution of a powerful, nearly spherical lens in aquatic vertebrates to achieve focus, a classic example of convergent evolution driven by the laws of optics.\nThe final answer required is solely the numerical value for the underwater corneal power.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.41}$$", "id": "2562813"}, {"introduction": "With the cornea's refractive role diminished in aquatic media, the task of focusing light falls almost entirely upon the lens.

There are no contradictions.\n\nThe verdict is that the problem is **valid**. The solution will proceed.\n\nThe first task is to derive the Gaussian imaging relation, $\\frac{1}{o} + \\frac{1}{i} = \\frac{1}{f}$. The properties of a thin lens, particularly the existence of a focal length $f$, are a direct consequence of applying Snell's law ($n_{1}\\sin\\theta_{1} = n_{2}\\sin\\theta_{2}$) at the lens surfaces under the paraxial approximation ($\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta \\approx \\tan\\theta$). Assuming the property that parallel incident rays converge at a single focal point a distance $f$ from the lens, we can use ray geometry to derive the imaging equation.\n\nConsider a point on an object of height $h_o$ located at a distance $o$ from the center of a thin convex lens. We trace two principal rays to locate the corresponding image point of height $h_i$ at a distance $i$.\n1.  A ray from the top of the object travels parallel to the optical axis. Upon passing through the lens, it is refracted to pass through the principal focal point $F$ on the image side, which is at a distance $f$ from the lens center.\n2.  A ray from the top of the object passes through the center of the thin lens. In the thin lens approximation, this ray continues undeviated.\n\nThe intersection of these two rays defines the location of the image. By constructing these rays, we can identify two pairs of similar triangles.\n\nLet the origin be at the center of the lens. The optical axis is the x-axis. The object is at $x = -o$ and the image is at $x = i$.\nFrom the undeviated ray passing through the center of the lens, we form two right triangles. One has vertices at $(-o, 0)$, $(-o, h_o)$, and $(0, 0)$. The other has vertices at $(i, 0)$, $(i, h_i)$, and $(0, 0)$. Note that a real image formed by a single convex lens is inverted, so $h_i$ is negative. For geometric ratios, we use the magnitudes of the heights, $|h_i|$ and $|h_o|$. These triangles are similar. From this similarity, we obtain the relation:\n$$\n\\frac{|h_i|}{h_o} = \\frac{i}{o}\n$$\n\nFrom the ray that is initially parallel to the axis, we form another pair of similar triangles. The first triangle is formed by the focal point $F$, the point $(i, 0)$ on the axis, and the image point $(i, h_i)$. Its base has length $i - f$ and its height is $|h_i|$. The second triangle is formed by the point where the parallel ray hits the lens $(0, h_o)$, the lens center $(0,0)$, and the focal point $F$ at $(f,0)$. Its base has length $f$ and its height is $h_o$. These two triangles are also similar. Therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{|h_i|}{h_o} = \\frac{i - f}{f}\n$$\n\nEquating the two expressions for the ratio of heights $\\frac{|h_i|}{h_o}$:\n$$\n\\frac{i}{o} = \\frac{i - f}{f}\n$$\nThis is the relation we must solve.
