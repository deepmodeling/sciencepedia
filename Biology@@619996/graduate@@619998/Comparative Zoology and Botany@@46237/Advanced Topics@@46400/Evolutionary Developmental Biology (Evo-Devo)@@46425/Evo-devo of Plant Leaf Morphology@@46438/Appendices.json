Hydathodes are specialized structures at serration tips or margins that exude xylem sap and are consistently contiguous with a major vein. You have access to standard auxin reporters and vascular identity markers, as well as chemical and genetic tools to perturb auxin transport and procambial differentiation. Assume the following well-tested facts as a base: auxin response reporters such as DR5 (a synthetic promoter driving a fluorescent protein) increase fluorescence with increased nuclear auxin signaling; the DII-VENUS sensor (an Aux/IAA domain II fused to the VENUS fluorophore) is degraded more rapidly at higher auxin, so its fluorescence is inversely related to auxin; polar auxin transport depends on PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1) polarity; the early procambial identity marker ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA HOMEOBOX8 (ATHB8) labels pre-vascular strands; and the polar auxin transport inhibitor N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) reduces canalization of auxin flow. Causality in development can be probed by temporal precedence (a cause must precede an effect) and tests of necessity and sufficiency using targeted perturbations.\n\nWhich experimental design (including time-resolved imaging and targeted perturbations) would most cleanly distinguish whether hydathode-associated veins are a cause or a consequence of local auxin maxima, and also specifies interpretable outcomes that decide between the two hypotheses?\n\nA. Use a dual-reporter Arabidopsis line expressing DR5rev::nuclear VENUS for auxin response and ATHB8::Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP; Green Fluorescent Protein) for procambial identity. Perform laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM; Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy) time-lapse imaging of early leaf primordia encompassing the hydathode region at the margin, acquiring images every $10$ minutes over $6$ hours to extract the onset times $t_{\\mathrm{auxin}}$ and $t_{\\mathrm{vein}}$ of DR5 and ATHB8 signals, respectively. Execute two perturbations with proper controls: (i) a micro-applied lanolin bead containing indole-$3$-acetic acid at the hydathode tip to test sufficiency, and (ii) a narrow NPA-containing agarose strip crossing the margin proximal to the hydathode to transiently block polar auxin transport and a procambial-specific, inducible stabilization of the auxin response inhibitor BODENLOS (BDL; stabilized IAA12) using an ATHB8-driver activated just before $t_{\\mathrm{auxin}}$ to test necessity. Interpretations: if veins cause auxin maxima, then $t_{\\mathrm{vein}}<t_{\\mathrm{auxin}}$, ATHB8 induction is necessary for the DR5 maximum (inducible BDL prevents the DR5 increase), and local auxin addition does not create ATHB8 strands without pre-existing vein cues. If auxin maxima cause veins, then $t_{\\mathrm{auxin}}<t_{\\mathrm{vein}}$, inducible BDL blocks ATHB8 but leaves the early DR5 maximum intact, the NPA strip prevents ATHB8 canalization but not the initial DR5 increase at the hydathode, and the auxin bead is sufficient to induce an ectopic ATHB8 strand oriented toward the bead.\n\nB. Image a PIN1::GFP line by LSCM at a single late time point when hydathodes are morphologically visible, after a whole-seedling NPA treatment, to assess whether PIN1 polarity aligns with hydathode-associated veins. If PIN1 polarity is altered by NPA, infer that auxin maxima are a consequence of veins.\n\nC. Perform laser ablation of hydathode epithem cells and then collect whole-leaf tissue for bulk liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry quantification of free indole-$3$-acetic acid at $2$ and $24$ hours post-ablation. If auxin levels decrease after ablation, infer that veins cause auxin maxima; if they do not, infer the opposite.\n\nD. Use the DII-VENUS auxin sensor for time-lapse imaging at $30$-minute intervals over $12$ hours, but impose a global exogenous auxin spray just after ATHB8 becomes detectable in unperturbed controls. If the DII-VENUS signal decreases everywhere and ATHB8 expands, infer that auxin maxima are sufficient and therefore primary causes of vein formation.\n\nE. Profile single-nucleus transcriptomes of hydathode-adjacent cells and interior mesophyll at a single developmental stage to reconstruct pseudotime trajectories of procambial differentiation. If auxin-responsive genes are enriched before vascular genes along pseudotime, infer that auxin maxima cause hydathode-associated vein formation.\n\nSelect the option that provides a decisive, causally interpretable design with appropriate temporal resolution and perturbations, and that states clear outcome criteria discriminating between the two hypotheses.", "solution": "The goal is to determine whether hydathode-associated veins are a cause or a consequence of local auxin maxima at the leaf margin. From first principles about causality in developmental systems, three criteria are central: temporal precedence (the cause must occur before the effect), necessity (blocking the putative cause eliminates the effect), and sufficiency (artificially imposing the putative cause generates the effect). From well-tested auxin canalization theory, local auxin maxima at the margin drive PIN1 polarity and preprocambial strand formation; conversely, established veins could conceivably influence auxin accumulation via transport sinks. The experimental design must therefore jointly (i) measure the onset times $t_{\\mathrm{auxin}}$ and $t_{\\mathrm{vein}}$ in the same tissue with sufficient temporal resolution, and (ii) implement spatially and temporally precise perturbations that test necessity and sufficiency without confounding global effects.\n\nOption A proposes a dual-reporter line combining DR5rev::nuclear VENUS and ATHB8::GFP, enabling simultaneous readout of auxin response and procambial identity. Time-lapse imaging every $10$ minutes over $6$ hours ensures that the temporal ordering of reporter onsets can be resolved, allowing a direct comparison of $t_{\\mathrm{auxin}}$ and $t_{\\mathrm{vein}}$ in the hydathode region. The two perturbations are appropriately targeted: a local auxin source (lanolin bead with indole-$3$-acetic acid) tests sufficiency by assessing whether an imposed auxin maximum can induce an ectopic ATHB8-positive preprocambial strand oriented toward the source, consistent with canalization; the narrow NPA strip interrupts polar transport locally, which should disrupt canalization and prevent reinforcement of strands without necessarily eliminating an initial auxin maximum at the hydathode, and the procambial-specific, inducible expression of stabilized BODENLOS (IAA12) tests necessity of auxin response in procambial cells. Critically, the design specifies interpretable outcomes in terms of inequalities between onset times and the presence or absence of DR5 or ATHB8 signals under perturbations. If veins cause auxin maxima, one would expect $t_{\\mathrm{vein}}<t_{\\mathrm{auxin}}$ and that blocking procambial differentiation (via inducible BDL in the ATHB8 domain) would prevent the DR5 maximum, demonstrating necessity of veins for the auxin maximum; conversely, if auxin maxima cause veins, one expects $t_{\\mathrm{auxin}}<t_{\\mathrm{vein}}$, no effect of procambial inhibition on the early DR5 maximum (necessity of auxin response for vein formation but not for the auxin maximum itself), and sufficiency of local auxin to induce ectopic ATHB8 strands. This option thus meets the temporal, necessity, and sufficiency criteria with localized and time-controlled manipulations and specifies clear decision rules.\n\nOption B uses only a static, late time point of PIN1::GFP after a global NPA treatment. This lacks temporal precedence information between auxin maxima and vein identity because no auxin reporter is included and imaging is not time-resolved. Global NPA further introduces systemic alterations that confound local interpretations at hydathodes. Inferring causality from altered PIN1 polarity at a late stage is insufficient; it tests neither necessity nor sufficiency and cannot establish $t_{\\mathrm{auxin}}$ versus $t_{\\mathrm{vein}}$. Therefore, it is inadequate. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption C employs laser ablation of hydathode epithem followed by bulk auxin quantification at $2$ and $24$ hours. While ablation is a perturbation, bulk liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry lacks spatial resolution and cannot distinguish auxin changes at the hydathode margin versus the rest of the leaf. Moreover, two coarse time points cannot resolve onset ordering, and ablation damages tissue, introducing wound responses that alter auxin levels independently. This design does not implement reporter-based time-resolved readouts nor controlled tests of necessity or sufficiency in procambial cells. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption D uses DII-VENUS time-lapse but imposes a global auxin spray after ATHB8 becomes detectable in controls. The temporal manipulation is misplaced: altering auxin after $t_{\\mathrm{vein}}$ eliminates the ability to test temporal precedence. A global auxin increase confounds local causality and saturates the system, precluding interpretation of necessity or sufficiency at hydathodes. Additionally, global elevation of auxin cannot distinguish whether hydathode-associated veins arose due to an antecedent local maximum. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption E suggests single-nucleus transcriptomics at a single stage with computational pseudotime. Although pseudotime can order cell states, it is inferred and not a direct measurement of real time, and a single-stage snapshot cannot establish actual onset times $t_{\\mathrm{auxin}}$ and $t_{\\mathrm{vein}}$ in vivo. Furthermore, it lacks targeted perturbations testing necessity and sufficiency. While enrichment of auxin-responsive genes before vascular genes along pseudotime might correlate with a model, it does not provide direct causal discrimination at the hydathode margin. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, only Option A integrates simultaneous, high-temporal-resolution imaging of auxin response and procambial identity with spatially and temporally precise perturbations that test both necessity and sufficiency, and it articulates clear, falsifiable outcome criteria distinguishing whether hydathode-associated veins are a cause or a consequence of local auxin maxima. Verdict: Correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2569355"}, {"introduction": "The remarkable diversity of leaf forms, from simple to highly compound, often arises from the iterative application of simple developmental rules. This exercise employs a Lindenmayer system (L-system), a powerful computational framework, to model the generative logic of leaf morphogenesis [@problem_id:2569304]. By implementing and modifying a set of parallel rewriting rules, you will gain direct insight into how small changes in developmental parameters can lead to large-scale differences in morphology, a core principle of evolutionary developmental biology.", "problem": "Construct a complete, runnable program that formalizes and analyzes a simplified model of leaf morphogenesis using a parallel rewriting grammar in the sense of a Lindenmayer System (L-system). The biological rationale is that leaf shape is built by modular and iterative decisions at the shoot apical meristem and along the rachis, where lateral leaflet primordia are either initiated or suppressed based on the balance of activation and inhibition signals. Your model must begin from the following fundamental base, which are well-tested facts and core definitions: (i) leaf development is modular and iterative along the proximodistal axis, (ii) compound leaves arise by repeated lateral initiation of leaflet primordia along a rachis, whereas simple leaves arise when such lateral initiation is suppressed, and (iii) a parallel rewriting system can encode discrete developmental decisions and branching architectures by iteratively applying local rules to all modules simultaneously.\n\nDefine the alphabet, parameters, and rules as follows (all mathematical entities are written in LaTeX): \n- Alphabet with parameters: a rachis module $X(g)$ where $g \\in [0,1]$ is a dimensionless growth potential, a leaflet terminal $L(g)$, and bracket symbols $[$ and $]$ to denote lateral branches. \n- Control parameters: branching propensity $b \\in (0,1]$, inhibitory threshold $\\tau \\in [0,1]$, proximodistal attenuation $r \\in (0,1]$, resource partition to laterals $k \\in (0,1]$, and iteration count $T \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$.\n- Axiom (initial string): $X(1)$.\n- Parallel rewriting at each discrete iteration $t \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,T\\}$ applied to every module simultaneously:\n  1. For each rachis module $X(g)$, compute an activation $a = b \\cdot g$. If $a \\ge \\tau$ then rewrite \n     $$X(g) \\Rightarrow [\\,L(k g)\\,]\\,X(r g)\\,[\\,L(k g)\\,],$$ \n     which captures the initiation of two lateral leaflet primordia while continuing the rachis with attenuated potential; otherwise, if $a < \\tau$ then rewrite \n     $X(g) \\Rightarrow L(g)$, \n     which captures the cessation of rachis growth into a terminal lamina.\n  2. For each $L(g)$, keep $L(g)$ unchanged.\n- After the $T$ iterations, perform a terminalization pass that maps any remaining rachis modules to lamina: $X(g) \\mapsto L(g)$, leaving $L(g)$ unchanged.\n\nDefine the following quantitative outputs to analyze morphology:\n- The total number of leaf terminals $N_T$, defined as the total count of symbols $L(\\cdot)$ after terminalization. Interpret $N_T = 1$ as a simple leaf and $N_T > 1$ as a compound leaf.\n- The rachis branching depth $D$, defined as the number of iterations in which the rachis actually branched (that is, the number of successive iterations from the start for which $b \\cdot r^{i-1} \\ge \\tau$ holds before termination or until $T$ is reached).\n- The total lamina potential $S$, defined as the sum of all $g$ values over terminal symbols $L(g)$ after terminalization. This is a dimensionless proxy for a size-like trait under the assumption that lamina area scales monotonically with $g$. You must compute $S$ exactly under the given rules as a function of the parameters and the realized branching depth.\n\nYour program must, for each parameter set, compute and return the triplet $[N_T, D, S]$, with $N_T$ and $D$ as integers and $S$ as a floating-point real number. No physical units are involved; all quantities are dimensionless. No random numbers may be used.\n\nTest suite. Your program must evaluate the following parameter sets, covering a typical case, threshold boundary conditions, strong attenuation, high-propagation, and iteration and attenuation edge cases:\n- Case $1$: $b = 0.4$, $\\tau = 0.5$, $r = 0.9$, $k = 0.5$, $T = 3$.\n- Case $2$: $b = 0.8$, $\\tau = 0.5$, $r = 0.5$, $k = 0.5$, $T = 1$.\n- Case $3$: $b = 0.8$, $\\tau = 0.5$, $r = 0.7$, $k = 0.4$, $T = 2$.\n- Case $4$ (boundary $b = \\tau$): $b = 0.5$, $\\tau = 0.5$, $r = 0.8$, $k = 0.3$, $T = 3$.\n- Case $5$ (strong attenuation): $b = 0.9$, $\\tau = 0.5$, $r = 0.1$, $k = 0.6$, $T = 5$.\n- Case $6$ (high propagation and permissive inhibition): $b = 0.9$, $\\tau = 0.3$, $r = 0.9$, $k = 0.5$, $T = 4$.\n- Case $7$ (iteration edge $T = 0$): $b = 0.9$, $\\tau = 0.1$, $r = 0.9$, $k = 0.5$, $T = 0$.\n- Case $8$ (attenuation boundary $r = 1$): $b = 0.6$, $\\tau = 0.5$, $r = 1.0$, $k = 0.25$, $T = 3$.\n\nFinal output format.

The system is well-defined, with a specified alphabet, axiom, and a set of parallel rewriting rules governed by a set of parameters. The validity of the problem is confirmed, as it is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and algorithmically solvable. No contradictions or ambiguities are present. We shall proceed with a formal derivation of the required morphological outputs, which will then form the basis for the computational implementation.\n\nThe state of the system evolves from an initial axiom $X(1)$. At each iteration, the single active rachis module, denoted $X(g)$, is subject to a rewriting rule. This process can be analyzed analytically without simulating the full string representation, which is computationally inefficient. The system's evolution is determined entirely by the state of the main rachis. Let $g_t$ be the growth potential of the main rachis at the beginning of iteration $t+1$. The initial state corresponds to $g_0 = 1$.\n\nFirst, we determine the rachis branching depth, $D$. The problem defines $D$ as the number of consecutive iterations from the start in which the rachis branches. Branching at iteration $i$ (for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, T\\}$) occurs if the activation $a_{i-1} = b \\cdot g_{i-1}$ is greater than or equal to the threshold $\\tau$, where $g_{i-1}$ is the rachis potential at the start of that iteration. The potential of the main rachis evolves as $g_0 = 1$ and $g_i = r \\cdot g_{i-1}$ after each branching event. Thus, $g_{i-1} = r^{i-1}$. The condition for branching at iteration $i$ is $b \\cdot r^{i-1} \\ge \\tau$. $D$ is the maximum integer $d$ such that $0 \\le d \\le T$ and this condition holds for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, d\\}$. This value can be computed algorithmically by iterating from $i=1$ to $T$ and counting the consecutive successes of this test, stopping at the first failure.\n\nSecond, we derive the total number of leaf terminals, $N_T$. The system starts with one module. For each of the $D$ branching iterations, the rule $X(g) \\Rightarrow [\\,L(k g)\\,]\\,X(r g)\\,[\\,L(k g)\\,]$ is applied. This rule replaces one module, $X(g)$, with three modules, but two of them, $L(kg)$, are terminal leaflets. This operation adds $2$ new terminal leaflets to the total count. After $D$ such iterations, $2D$ lateral leaflets have been created. The main rachis, now with potential $r^D$, either terminates in a subsequent iteration (if $D < T$) or is converted to a terminal leaflet by the final terminalization pass (if $D=T$). In both cases, the single main rachis ultimately becomes one terminal leaflet. Therefore, the total number of leaflets is the sum of the lateral leaflets and the single main-axis leaflet:\n$$N_T = 2D + 1$$\nIf no branching occurs ($D=0$), the initial axiom $X(1)$ becomes $L(1)$ at the first opportunity (either in iteration $t=1$ if $T \\ge 1$, or by terminalization if $T=0$), resulting in $N_T = 2(0) + 1 = 1$, which is consistent.\n\nThird, we derive the total lamina potential, $S$. This is the sum of the growth potentials $g$ of all terminal $L(g)$ modules in the final structure. This sum consists of two parts: the sum of potentials from the lateral leaflets and the potential of the terminalized main rachis.\nFor each branching iteration $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, D\\}$, the rachis has potential $g_{i-1} = r^{i-1}$. It generates two lateral leaflets, each with potential $k \\cdot g_{i-1} = k \\cdot r^{i-1}$. The total potential from these lateral leaflets, summed over all $D$ branching events, is:\n$$S_{\\text{lateral}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{D} 2 \\cdot (k \\cdot r^{i-1}) = 2k \\sum_{j=0}^{D-1} r^j$$\nThe potential of the main rachis after $D$ branching events is $g_D = r^D$. This module becomes the final terminal leaflet on the main axis. Its potential is $S_{\\text{rachis}} = r^D$.\nThe total potential $S$ is the sum $S_{\\text{lateral}} + S_{\\text{rachis}}$. The summation is a geometric series. We must consider two cases for its evaluation.\n\nCase 1: $r=1$. The sum becomes $\\sum_{j=0}^{D-1} 1^j = D$. The potential of the final rachis is $1^D=1$.\n$$S = 2kD + 1 \\quad (\\text{for } r=1)$$\nCase 2: $r \\ne 1$. The sum of the geometric series is $\\frac{1-r^D}{1-r}$.\n$$S = 2k \\left(\\frac{1-r^D}{1-r}\\right) + r^D \\quad (\\text{for } r \\ne 1)$$\nThese formulae hold even for the edge case $D=0$. If $D=0$, the sum $\\sum_{j=0}^{-1}$ is empty and evaluates to $0$. The rachis potential is $r^0=1$. Thus, $S=1$, which is correct as the final structure is simply $L(1)$.\n\nThe computational program will implement this analytical solution. For each parameter set, it will first compute $D$, then use $D$ to compute $N_T$ and $S$ via the derived closed-form expressions.

For a balanced design, the observed mean squares are estimators of linear combinations of the underlying variance components. The model for a phenotypic measurement $y_{ij}$ on the $j$-th offspring in the $i$-th family is $y_{ij} = \\mu + f_i + e_{ij}$, where $\\mu$ is the population mean, $f_i$ is the random effect of the $i$-th family, and $e_{ij}$ is the within-family residual error.

Under the specified assumptions of random mating, no dominance, no epistasis, and negligible maternal effects, the covariance among half-siblings is one-quarter of the additive genetic variance, $V_A$:\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{fam}}^2 = \\text{Cov}(\\text{HS}) = \\frac{1}{4}V_A$$\nFrom this fundamental relationship, we can express the additive genetic variance in terms of the among-family variance component:\n$$V_A = 4 \\sigma_{\\text{fam}}^2$$\n\nThe narrow-sense heritability, $h^2$, is defined as the ratio of the additive genetic variance to the total phenotypic variance:\n$$h^2 = \\frac{V_A}{V_P} = \\frac{4 \\sigma_{\\text{fam}}^2}{\\sigma_{\\text{fam}}^2 + \\sigma_{\\text{within}}^2}$$\nSubstituting the estimated variance components into this expression yields the heritability of the leaf aspect ratio:\n$$h^2 = \\frac{4(0.009)}{0.009 + 0.180} = \\frac{0.036}{0.189} = \\frac{4}{21}$$\n\nThe final task is to predict the single-generation evolutionary response to selection, denoted as $R$ or $\\Delta\\bar{z}$. This response is given by the breeder's equation, which relates the response to the narrow-sense heritability and the phenotypic selection differential, $S$:\n$$R = h^2 S$$\nThe problem gives the selection differential as $S=0.250$. We can now compute the expected change in the mean aspect ratio:\n$$R = \\left(\\frac{4}{21}\\right) \\times 0.250 = \\left(\\frac{4}{21}\\right) \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{21}$$\nTo provide the final numerical answer, this fraction is converted to a decimal and rounded to four significant figures:\n$$R = \\frac{1}{21} \\approx 0.0476190...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$R \\approx 0.04762$$\nThis is the expected change in the mean leaf aspect ratio in the next generation under the specified selection regime.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.04762}$$", "id": "2569324"}]}
