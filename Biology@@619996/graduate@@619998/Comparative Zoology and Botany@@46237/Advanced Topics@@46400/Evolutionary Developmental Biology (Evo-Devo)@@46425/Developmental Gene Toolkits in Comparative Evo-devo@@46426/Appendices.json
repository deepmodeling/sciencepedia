Consider a conserved developmental regulator gene expressed in leaf primordia of two closely related flowering plant species that form viable first-generation hybrids (F1). Assume the following foundational bases: (i) the Central Dogma implies that steady-state messenger RNA abundance is proportional to the rate of transcription and decay, so that, under uniform processing, normalized RNA sequencing read counts are proportional to relative transcript abundances; (ii) in an F1 hybrid, the two alleles of a gene experience the same trans-acting environment, so any allelic imbalance in the F1 reflects cis-regulatory divergence; (iii) total interspecific expression divergence between parental species combines cis and trans contributions additively on a logarithmic fold-change scale.\n\nYou are given bias-corrected RNA sequencing measurements for a single gene:\n- Parent A: gene-mapped reads $= 1500$ from a library with $2.5 \\times 10^{7}$ total mapped reads.\n- Parent B: gene-mapped reads $= 300$ from a library with $1.5 \\times 10^{7}$ total mapped reads.\n- F1 hybrid allele-specific expression (Allele-Specific Expression (ASE)): reads mapping to the Parent A allele in the F1 $= 450$; reads mapping to the Parent B allele in the F1 $= 300$.\n\nAssume equal effective transcript lengths across samples, identical processing pipelines, and no parent-of-origin imprinting or mapping bias beyond the stated corrections.

The analytical framework is based on the additivity of these components on a logarithmic scale.\n\nFirst, we must normalize the gene expression measurements to account for differences in library sequencing depth.

This is measured from the allele-specific expression (ASE) in the first-generation ($F_1$) hybrid. In the $F_1$ hybrid, the alleles from Parent $A$ and Parent $B$ are in a common trans-regulatory environment. Thus, any difference in their expression is attributable to cis-regulatory differences.

It is a well-formulated question in experimental design within molecular genetics and evolutionary biology.

This means replacing the enhancers of $G_A$ with the enhancers of $G_B$ in species $A$, and vice-versa in species $B$. Using CRISPR-mediated homology-directed repair *in situ* achieves this with minimal off-target effects, preserving the native genomic context and controlling for position effects, copy number, and testing the element within a defined trans-acting environment (that of the host species). The resulting change in phenotype $P$ can be directly attributed to the swapped enhancers. An independent confirmation can be achieved by testing both species' enhancers in a common trans-environment, such as an $F_1$ hybrid, and measuring allele-specific expression.\n\n2.  **To test protein-coding contributions:** The ideal experiment compares the function of the protein variants, $G_A$ and $G_B$, when they are expressed under identical conditions. This requires:\n    a. Driving both coding sequences (as cDNAs to exclude native cis-regulatory elements) with the *exact same* promoter and enhancer elements.\n    b. Placing these constructs in the *exact same* genomic location to control for position effects. A phiC31 landing site is perfect for this.\n    c. Ensuring a single copy of the construct is integrated to control for dosage.\n    d. Testing their function in the same genetic background, for example, by rescuing a null mutant of the endogenous gene $G$.\n    The difference in the ability of protein $G_A$ versus $G_B$ to rescue the phenotype $P$ directly measures their functional divergence. This framework can be extended to test chimeric proteins (e.g., swapping DNA-binding and effector domains) to map the specific parts of the protein responsible for functional changes.\n\nA comprehensive strategy should combine these rigorous approaches.\n\n### **Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A.

Rescue a species $A$ $G$ null mutant... Additionally, measure allele-specific reporter activity... in the same $F_1$ hybrid trans background...**\n\nThis option describes a state-of-the-art, comprehensive experimental plan that precisely matches the derived principles.\n-   **Cis-regulatory analysis:** The reciprocal *in situ* enhancer swap via CRISPR is the gold standard method. It perfectly controls for genomic position, copy number, and the native context of the gene, cleanly isolating the enhancer's contribution in two different trans-backgrounds. The additional allele-specific test in $F_1$ hybrids is a powerful, independent method to confirm cis-regulatory divergence by placing both enhancers in an identical trans-environment.\n-   **Protein-coding analysis:** The use of a null mutant rescue assay with single-copy transgenes inserted at a phiC31 landing site is also the gold standard. It flawlessly controls for cis-regulation (both proteins driven by the same enhancer), genomic position, and copy number.\n-   **Use of Chimeras:** The plan explicitly includes testing domain-swapped chimeras in this rigorous assay to map functional differences within the protein.\n-   **Controls:** All required controls are implemented using the most appropriate modern tools. This strategy directly measures the phenotypic consequences of both cis and coding changes *in vivo*.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**. This is a textbook example of a rigorous experimental design for this type of research question.\n\n**B. Ubiquitously overexpress species $A$ and species $B$ $G$ coding sequences using a heat-shock promoter from multicopy random insertions... compare native enhancer activities by cloning... and integrating each into its native species’ genome at random positions.**\n\nThis strategy is severely flawed.\n-   \"Multicopy random insertions\" violates the core principles of controlling for copy number and genomic position effects. Expression levels will be highly variable and unpredictable, making any comparison meaningless.\n-   A ubiquitous \"heat-shock promoter\" leads to non-physiological, ectopic expression. The resulting phenotype may not be relevant to the gene's normal developmental function and the divergence observed in nature.\n-   Comparing enhancers by integrating reporters at \"random positions\" again fails to control for position effects. Comparing an enhancer from species $A$ in a species $A$ background to an enhancer from species $B$ in a species $B$ background confounds cis and trans effects.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**. This design is methodologically unsound and would not produce reliable data.\n\n**C. Generate $F_1$ hybrids between species $A$ and species $B$ and measure allele-specific expression of $G$ messenger RNA to estimate cis effects. For coding, purify recombinant... proteins and quantify in vitro DNA-binding affinity... Attribute any difference... to the component that shows the larger measured difference.**\n\nThis strategy is incomplete and relies on indirect correlations.\n-   **Cis-analysis:** Allele-specific expression in $F_1$ hybrids is a valid method to show cis-regulatory divergence at the mRNA level, but it doesn't directly measure the impact on the final phenotype $P$.\n-   **Coding analysis:** *In vitro* assays (protein purification, binding affinity) can reveal molecular differences but do not represent the *in vivo* situation. Protein function depends on the cellular context, including cofactor availability, chromatin state, and post-translational modifications. An *in vitro* result may not correlate with the *in vivo* phenotypic effect.\n-   **Attribution:** The method for attribution is unscientific. It is not valid to compare the \"magnitude\" of a change in mRNA expression with a change in biochemical affinity and use this to explain a complex organismal phenotype.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**. This approach lacks the essential *in vivo* functional tests that link genetic changes directly to the phenotype.\n\n**D. In species $A$, replace only the core promoter and $5^{\\prime}$ untranslated region... In species $B$, replace only the $G$ coding sequence... Use differences between these two edits to assign cis versus coding contributions respectively, without additional controls.**\n\nThis strategy is incomplete and poorly designed.\n-   The cis-regulatory swap is partial. It ignores distal enhancers, which are often the key determinants of expression in developmental genes. Therefore, it does not adequately test the cis contribution.\n-   The two proposed experiments are not a symmetrical comparison. One tests a partial cis-element swap in species $A$; the other tests a coding sequence swap in species $B$. Comparing the outcomes of these two disparate experiments to \"assign\" contributions is not a controlled comparison.\n-   The phrase \"without additional controls\" explicitly states that the design is insufficient. Science requires rigorous controls and, ideally, reciprocal experiments to test for context dependence (epistasis).\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**. This is an asymmetric and incomplete experimental design.\n\n**E. Construct protein chimeras... and express them using... multicopy transgenes. In parallel, assay isolated... enhancers in cultured cells via luciferase reporters. Attribute regulatory versus coding contributions based on patterns across these ectopic and in vitro assays.**\n\nThis strategy, like B, relies on flawed and indirect methods.\n-   \"Multicopy transgenes\" again introduces uncontrolled variability in copy number and position effects.\n-   Expressing proteins with GAL4 drivers, while more specific than heat shock, is still an ectopic expression system. Its relevance to the natural phenotype must be demonstrated, not assumed.\n-   Luciferase assays in \"cultured cells\" are an *in vitro* system. They may lack the correct cellular context (e.g., specific transcription factors of the relevant tissue) to accurately report the enhancer's function during development.\n-   Attribution based on \"patterns\" from ectopic and *in vitro* data is qualitative and inferential, not a direct quantitative partitioning of contributions to the phenotype $P$.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**. This strategy fails to perform the necessary controlled *in vivo* experiments.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2565853"}]}
