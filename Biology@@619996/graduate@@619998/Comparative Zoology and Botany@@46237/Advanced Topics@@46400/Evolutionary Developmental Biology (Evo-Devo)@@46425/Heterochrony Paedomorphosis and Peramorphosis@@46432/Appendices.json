It occurs via processes that slow or shorten development, such as delayed onset (postdisplacement), reduced rate (neoteny), or earlier offset (progenesis).\n- **Peramorphosis** results in a descendant adult that is \"hyper-adult\" or has exaggerated traits compared to the ancestor. It occurs via processes that speed up or prolong development, such as earlier onset (predisplacement), increased rate (acceleration), or delayed offset (hypermorphosis).\n\nIn this case, postdisplacement causes the total duration of development, $\\Delta t = t_1 - t_0$, to be shorter for the descendant.\nDuration for ancestor: $\\Delta t_{\\text{anc}} = t_{1, \\text{anc}} - t_{0, \\text{anc}} = 10 - 0 = 10$ arbitrary time units.\nDuration for descendant: $\\Delta t_{\\text{desc}} = t_{1, \\text{desc}} - t_{0, \\text{desc}} = 10 - 2 = 8$ arbitrary time units.\n\nSince the rate $r$ is the same for both lineages, the shorter developmental period for the descendant will result in a smaller adult trait value compared to the ancestor.

Here, $X_{0}$ is the initial trait value prior to the onset of trait-specific growth at time $t_{0}$, and $r$ is the constant rate of trait growth during the interval in which growth occurs. Let the ancestral lineage have parameters $(X_{0}, r, t_{0}, t_{1})$ with $t_{1} > t_{0}$ defining the termination of growth (the end of development for this trait), so the ancestral adult size is $X_{\\mathrm{A}} = X_{0} + r\\,(t_{1} - t_{0})$.\n\nConsider a descendant lineage that differs by heterochronic parameter shifts in onset and offset times and potentially also in rate, as follows: its onset time is shifted by $\\Delta_{0}$ to $t_{0}' = t_{0} + \\Delta_{0}$, its termination time is shifted by $\\Delta_{1}$ to $t_{1}' = t_{1} + \\Delta_{1}$, and its growth rate becomes $r'$.

The linear growth model is a standard first-order approximation, and the parameters ($\\Delta_{0}$, $\\Delta_{1}$, $r'$) are the formal representations of changes in developmental timing and rate. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear algebraic constraint and sufficient information to derive the requested expression for $r'$. The condition $t_{1}' > t_{0}'$ ensures that the duration of growth is positive, preventing a division-by-zero singularity and guaranteeing a unique, meaningful solution for $r'$.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective mathematical and biological language. The terms used have standard, unambiguous definitions within the relevant scientific discipline.\n\nThe verdict is that the problem is **valid**. It is a straightforward exercise in algebraic manipulation and conceptual application of established biological principles. A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe fundamental premise is the equivalence of adult size in the ancestor and the descendant. The total size $X(t)$ is the sum of the initial size $X_{0}$ and the growth accumulated during development. The problem states that the initial size $X_0$ is the same for both lineages. Therefore, for the final adult sizes to be equal, the total amount of growth accumulated must also be equal. The accumulated growth for the ancestor is the product of its growth rate $r$ and its growth duration $(t_{1} - t_{0})$. Similarly, for the descendant, it is the product of its rate $r'$ and duration $(t_{1}' - t_{0}')$.\n\nThe constraint is given by the equation:\n$$X_{0} + r'\\,(t_{1}' - t_{0}') = X_{0} + r\\,(t_{1} - t_{0})$$\nThis equation properly formalizes the condition that the adult trait values are identical. We begin by simplifying this expression. The initial size $X_{0}$ is a common term on both sides of the equation and can be canceled:\n$$r'\\,(t_{1}' - t_{0}') = r\\,(t_{1} - t_{0})$$\nThis equation makes explicit the core assumption: the product of rate and duration is an invariant for the evolutionary change under consideration.\n\nThe problem defines the descendant's onset and offset times in terms of the ancestral times and parametric shifts $\\Delta_{0}$ and $\\Delta_{1}$:\n$$t_{0}' = t_{0} + \\Delta_{0}$$\n$$t_{1}' = t_{1} + \\Delta_{1}$$\nWe substitute these definitions into the simplified constraint equation:\n$$r'\\,((t_{1} + \\Delta_{1}) - (t_{0} + \\Delta_{0})) = r\\,(t_{1} - t_{0})$$\nThe term in the parentheses on the left-hand side can be rearranged to group the ancestral duration and the time shifts:\n$$r'\\,(t_{1} - t_{0} + \\Delta_{1} - \\Delta_{0}) = r\\,(t_{1} - t_{0})$$\nTo find the expression for the descendant's rate, $r'$, we must isolate it. This is achieved by dividing both sides by the descendant's growth duration, $(t_{1} - t_{0} + \\Delta_{1} - \\Delta_{0})$. This operation is valid because the problem statement includes the constraint $t_{1}' > t_{0}'$, which implies $(t_{1} + \\Delta_{1}) > (t_{0} + \\Delta_{0})$, and thus $(t_{1} - t_{0} + \\Delta_{1} - \\Delta_{0}) \\neq 0$.\nThe resulting closed-form analytic expression for $r'$ is:\n$$r' = r \\frac{t_{1} - t_{0}}{t_{1} - t_{0} + \\Delta_{1} - \\Delta_{0}}$$\nThis concludes the first part of the task.\n\nFor the second part, we classify the heterochronic modes. The terminology is defined as follows:\n- Onset timing: An earlier start to development ($\\Delta_{0} < 0$) is **predisplacement**. A later start ($\\Delta_{0} > 0$) is **postdisplacement**.\n- Offset timing: An earlier end to development ($\\Delta_{1} < 0$) is **progenesis**. A later end ($\\Delta_{1} > 0$) is **hypermorphosis**.\n- Growth rate: A faster rate ($r' > r$) is **acceleration**. A slower rate ($r' < r$) is **neoteny**.\n\nThe change in rate is coupled to the change in duration. Let the ancestral duration be $T = t_{1} - t_{0}$ and the descendant duration be $T' = t_{1}' - t_{0}' = T + \\Delta_{1} - \\Delta_{0}$. Our derived expression is equivalent to $r' = r \\frac{T}{T'}$.\n- If the descendant's growth duration is shortened ($T' < T$, which means $\\Delta_{1} - \\Delta_{0} < 0$), then $r' > r$. This is compensation by **acceleration**.\n- If the descendant's growth duration is lengthened ($T' > T$, which means $\\Delta_{1} - \\Delta_{0} > 0$), then $r' < r$. This is compensation by **neoteny**.\n- If the duration is unchanged ($T' = T$, which means $\\Delta_{1} = \\Delta_{0}$), then $r' = r$. This is a pure temporal displacement with no rate change, known as isochrony.\n\nWe now provide two examples with different developmental histories leading to the same adult size. Let us define a simple ancestral state with parameters $t_{0} = 5$, $t_{1} = 15$, and $r = 10$. The ancestral growth duration is $T = t_{1} - t_{0} = 10$. The total growth is $rT = 10 \\times 10 = 100$.\n\nExample 1: Delayed onset compensated by acceleration.\nLet the onset of growth be delayed by $2$ time units, and the offset be brought forward by $3$ time units.\n- $\\Delta_{0} = 2$. This is **postdisplacement**.\n- $\\Delta_{1} = -3$. This is **progenesis**.\nThe new descendant times are $t_{0}' = 5 + 2 = 7$ and $t_{1}' = 15 - 3 = 12$. The new duration is $T' = 12 - 7 = 5$.\nSince the duration has been halved ($T' = T/2$), the rate must double to maintain the same total growth. We verify this with our derived formula:\n$$r' = r \\frac{T}{T'} = 10 \\frac{10}{5} = 20$$\nSince $r' = 20 > r = 10$, this change constitutes **acceleration**. The total growth is $r'T' = 20 \\times 5 = 100$, which is identical to the ancestor. This descendant shows postdisplacement, progenesis, and acceleration.\n\nExample 2: Earlier onset compensated by neoteny.\nLet the onset of growth occur $2$ time units earlier, and the offset be delayed by $8$ time units.\n- $\\Delta_{0} = -2$. This is **predisplacement**.\n- $\\Delta_{1} = 8$. This is **hypermorphosis**.\nThe new descendant times are $t_{0}' = 5 - 2 = 3$ and $t_{1}' = 15 + 8 = 23$. The new duration is $T' = 23 - 3 = 20$.\nSince the duration has been doubled ($T' = 2T$), the rate must be halved. We verify:\n$$r' = r \\frac{T}{T'} = 10 \\frac{10}{20} = 5$$\nSince $r' = 5 < r = 10$, this change constitutes **neoteny**. The total growth is $r'T' = 5 \\times 20 = 100$, identical to the ancestor. This descendant shows predisplacement, hypermorphosis, and neoteny.\n\nBoth examples result in an identical change in adult size (zero change, in fact) but through entirely different modifications of the developmental program, as correctly captured by the heterochronic terminology.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{r \\frac{t_{1} - t_{0}}{t_{1} - t_{0} + \\Delta_{1} - \\Delta_{0}}}$$", "id": "2580473"}]}
