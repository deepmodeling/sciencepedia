The definitions are precise, the assumptions are standard in the field, and the question is well-posed, admitting a unique, derivable solution. All necessary components for the derivation are provided and are mutually consistent.\n\nThe solution is derived in two parts as requested.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the log-likelihood ratio score for a sequence $s = (b_{1}, \\dots, b_{L})$. The log-likelihood ratio, which we denote as $\\text{LLR}(s)$, is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the probability of the sequence under the motif model to its probability under the background model.\n$$\n\\text{LLR}(s) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{P(s | \\text{motif})}{P(s | \\text{background})}\\right)\n$$\nUnder the assumption of positional independence, the probability of sequence $s$ given the motif model (represented by the position weight matrix, PWM) is the product of the probabilities of the constituent bases at each position.\n$$\nP(s | \\text{motif}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{L} p_{i, b_i}\n$$\nwhere $p_{i, b_i}$ is the probability of base $b_i$ at position $i$ in the PWM. Similarly, the probability of sequence $s$ under the independent background model is the product of the background frequencies of its bases.\n$$\nP(s | \\text{background}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{L} q_{b_i}\n$$\nwhere $q_{b_i}$ is the background frequency of base $b_i$. Substituting these expressions into the definition of the log-likelihood ratio yields:\n$$\n\\text{LLR}(s) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^{L} p_{i, b_i}}{\\prod_{i=1}^{L} q_{b_i}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{L} \\frac{p_{i, b_i}}{q_{b_i}}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms that the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms, we obtain the final expression for the score:\n$$\n\\text{LLR}(s) = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{i, b_i}}{q_{b_i}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the standard log-odds score for a sequence.\n\nSecond, we derive the relationship between the binding energy $E(s)$ and this log-likelihood ratio score. The derivation is based on the provided assumption that the PWM probabilities $p_{i,b}$ are obtained from sequences sampled in proportion to their equilibrium occupancy, which itself is proportional to the Boltzmann weight $\\exp(-\\beta E(s))$, multiplied by their background frequency. The probability of sampling a specific sequence $s$ is therefore:\n$$\nP(\\text{sample } s) = \\frac{1}{Z_{\\text{total}}} P(s | \\text{background}) \\exp(-\\beta (E(s) - \\mu))\n$$\nwhere $Z_{\\text{total}}$ is the partition function over all possible sequences, and $\\mu$ is the chemical potential. Substituting the additive energy model $E(s) = \\sum_{j=1}^{L} \\epsilon_{j,b_{j}} + C$ and the background probability, we have:\n$$\nP(\\text{sample } s) = \\frac{1}{Z_{\\text{total}}} \\left(\\prod_{j=1}^{L} q_{b_j}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\beta\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{L} \\epsilon_{j,b_j} + C - \\mu\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\nP(\\text{sample } s) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta (C - \\mu))}{Z_{\\text{total}}} \\prod_{j=1}^{L} \\left(q_{b_j} \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon_{j,b_j})\\right)\n$$\nThe PWM probability $p_{i,b}$ is the marginal probability of observing base $b$ at position $i$. This is found by summing $P(\\text{sample } s)$ over all sequences $s$ where the base at position $i$ is $b$.\n$$\np_{i,b} = \\sum_{s \\text{ s.t. } b_i=b} P(\\text{sample } s)\n$$\nDue to the positional independence in the model, this summation simplifies. The total partition function $Z_{\\text{total}}$ can be factored into position-specific partition functions $Z_j = \\sum_{b' \\in \\{\\text{A,C,G,T}\\}} q_{b'} \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon_{j,b'})$. The full expression for $Z_{\\text{total}}$ becomes $Z_{\\text{total}} = \\exp(-\\beta (C - \\mu)) \\prod_{j=1}^{L} Z_j$. The marginalization for $p_{i,b}$ then yields a simple relation:\n$$\np_{i,b} = \\frac{q_b \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon_{i,b})}{Z_i}\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives the ratio of the PWM probability to the background frequency:\n$$\n\\frac{p_{i,b}}{q_b} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon_{i,b})}{Z_i}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides provides a direct link to the energy contribution:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{i,b}}{q_b}\\right) = -\\beta \\epsilon_{i,b} - \\ln(Z_i)\n$$\nSolving for the positional energy contribution $\\epsilon_{i,b}$ gives:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{i,b} = -\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{i,b}}{q_b}\\right) + \\ln(Z_i)\\right)\n$$\nThe total binding energy for a sequence $s = (b_1, \\dots, b_L)$ is given by the sum of positional contributions plus a constant $C$:\n$$\nE(s) = C + \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\epsilon_{i,b_i} = C + \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\left[-\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{i,b_i}}{q_{b_i}}\\right) + \\ln(Z_i)\\right)\\right]\n$$\nWe can separate the sequence-dependent and sequence-independent terms:\n$$\nE(s) = -\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{i,b_i}}{q_{b_i}}\\right) + \\left(C - \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\ln(Z_i)\\right)\n$$\nThe term in parentheses, $\\left(C - \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\ln(Z_i)\\right)$, is independent of the sequence $s$. It combines the sequence-independent part of the energy model, $C$, and the normalization constants $Z_i$. As per the problem, we define a single additive constant $E_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ to absorb all such sequence-independent terms. Thus, we set:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{ref}} = C - \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\ln(Z_i)\n$$\nThe final expression for the binding energy $E(s)$ is:\n$$\nE(s) = E_{\\mathrm{ref}} - \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{i,b_i}}{q_{b_i}}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression connects the binding energy directly to the log-likelihood score of the sequence, the inverse temperature, and a reference energy, as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E_{\\mathrm{ref}} - \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{i,b_{i}}}{q_{b_{i}}}\\right)}$$", "id": "2570758"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the principles of single-gene regulation, we now explore how interactions between genes give rise to complex network behaviors.

It can be rewritten as $\\alpha = s(1 + s^n)$.\n\nNext, to determine the stability of this symmetric steady state, we perform a linear stability analysis. We compute the Jacobian matrix $J$ of the system, evaluated at the steady state $(s, s)$. The functions for the right-hand sides of the ODEs are:\n$$\nf(x, y) = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + y^{n}} - x \\\\\ng(x, y) = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + x^{n}} - y\n$$\nThe entries of the Jacobian matrix $J(x, y)$ are the partial derivatives of $f$ and $g$:\n$$\nJ = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -\\frac{\\alpha n y^{n-1}}{(1 + y^n)^2} \\\\ -\\frac{\\alpha n x^{n-1}}{(1 + x^n)^2} & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe evaluate this matrix at the symmetric steady state $(s, s)$:\n$$\nJ(s, s) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -\\frac{\\alpha n s^{n-1}}{(1 + s^n)^2} \\\\ -\\frac{\\alpha n s^{n-1}}{(1 + s^n)^2} & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo simplify the off-diagonal terms, we use the steady-state relation $\\alpha = s(1 + s^n)$:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\alpha n s^{n-1}}{(1 + s^n)^2} = -\\frac{s(1 + s^n) n s^{n-1}}{(1 + s^n)^2} = -\\frac{n s^n}{1 + s^n}\n$$\nLet us denote this term by $C(s, n) = -\\frac{n s^n}{1 + s^n}$.

The condition for bistability is $\\alpha > \\alpha_c(n)$. To understand the effect of $n$, we analyze the behavior of the threshold function $\\alpha_c(n)$ for $n>1$.\nLet's examine the limits of $\\alpha_c(n)$:\nAs $n \\to 1^+$, the term $\\frac{n}{n-1} \\to \\infty$ and $(n-1)^{-1/n} \\to \\infty$. Thus, $\\lim_{n \\to 1^+} \\alpha_c(n) = \\infty$.

For any fixed production rate $\\alpha > 1$, there exists a value of $n$ above which the system becomes bistable.\nIn conclusion, increasing the cooperativity $n$ significantly lowers the critical production strength $\\alpha_c(n)$ required to achieve bistability. A higher $n$ makes the repression function more switch-like, which facilitates the stabilization of two distinct states. This means that a larger region of the $(\\alpha, n)$ parameter space supports bistability as $n$ increases, making the toggle switch a more robust and accessible mechanism for generating binary cell-fate decisions in both animal and plant development.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{n}{n-1} (n-1)^{-1/n}}$$", "id": "2570725"}, {"introduction": "The evolution of gene regulatory networks is shaped by powerful constraints, one of the most important being the need to maintain stoichiometry among interacting components.

The correct physical solution corresponds to the negative sign, which ensures that as $K_d \\to 0$ (infinitely tight binding), $[AD]$ approaches the concentration of the limiting reactant, $\\min(2af, d)$.\n$$ [AD] = \\frac{(2af + d + K_{d}) - \\sqrt{(2af + d + K_{d})^2 - 8afd}}{2} $$\nThe problem defines the selection coefficient $s$ as the equilibrium occupancy fraction of decoy sites, $\\theta = \\frac{[AD]}{d}$.\n$$ s = \\frac{[AD]}{d} = \\frac{(2af + d + K_{d}) - \\sqrt{(2af + d + K_{d})^2 - 8afd}}{2d} $$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values: $a = 10$, $f = 0.8$, $d = 40$, and $K_{d} = 8$.\nFirst, calculate the terms in the expression for $s$:\n-   $2af = 2 \\times 10 \\times 0.8 = 16$.\n-   $2af + d + K_{d} = 16 + 40 + 8 = 64$.\n-   $8afd = 8 \\times 10 \\times 0.8 \\times 40 = 2560$.\n-   $2d = 2 \\times 40 = 80$.\nSubstitute these values into the equation for $s$:\n$$ s = \\frac{64 - \\sqrt{(64)^2 - 2560}}{80} $$\n$$ s = \\frac{64 - \\sqrt{4096 - 2560}}{80} $$\n$$ s = \\frac{64 - \\sqrt{1536}}{80} $$\nTo simplify the square root, we perform prime factorization of $1536$:\n$$ 1536 = 512 \\times 3 = 2^9 \\times 3 = 2^8 \\times 2 \\times 3 = 256 \\times 6 $$\nSo, $\\sqrt{1536} = \\sqrt{256 \\times 6} = 16\\sqrt{6}$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $s$:\n$$ s = \\frac{64 - 16\\sqrt{6}}{80} $$\nFinally, we simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $16$:\n$$ s = \\frac{16(4 - \\sqrt{6})}{16(5)} = \\frac{4 - \\sqrt{6}}{5} $$\nThis is the exact, closed-form analytic expression for the selection coefficient.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{4 - \\sqrt{6}}{5}} $$", "id": "2570696"}]}
