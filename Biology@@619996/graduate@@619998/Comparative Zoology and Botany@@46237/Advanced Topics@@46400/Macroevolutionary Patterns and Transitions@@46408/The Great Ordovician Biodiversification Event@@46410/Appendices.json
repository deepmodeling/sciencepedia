The stratigraphic relations obey the law of superposition: deeper beds are older. Four ash beds precisely bracket the two horizons and have high-precision uranium–lead zircon ages measured by Chemical Abrasion–Isotope Dilution–Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry (CA–ID–TIMS).

The absolute ages of these horizons are constrained by the uranium-lead ages of four stratigraphically bracketing volcanic ash beds. The solution proceeds by applying the principle of superposition and the method of interval propagation.\n\nFirst, we establish the $95\\%$ confidence intervals for the true age of each ash bed. The problem states that the uncertainties are $2\\sigma$, which corresponds to a $95\\%$ confidence level for a Gaussian-distributed variable. An age given as $\\mu \\pm \\delta$, where $\\delta$ is the $2\\sigma$ uncertainty, corresponds to a $95\\%$ confidence interval of $[\\mu - \\delta, \\mu + \\delta]$.\n\nThe bracketing ages for the onset horizon are:\n- Ash bed $L_1$ (below onset): Age $A_{L1} = 470.52 \\pm 0.12$ million years ago (Ma).

The $95\\%$ confidence interval is $[468.12 - 0.09, 468.12 + 0.09]$, which is $[468.03, 468.21]$ Ma.\n\nAccording to the law of superposition, a deeper stratum is older. Since ages are given in Ma (millions of years *ago*), an older event has a larger numerical value. The onset horizon, with age $T_{onset}$, is stratigraphically between beds $L_1$ and $L_2$. Therefore, it must be younger than $L_1$ and older than $L_2$. This gives the inequality $A_{L2} < T_{onset} < A_{L1}$. To find the most conservative (widest) possible interval for $T_{onset}$ that is consistent with the $95\\%$ confidence intervals of the bracketing ages, we must use the lowest possible value from the interval for $A_{L2}$ and the highest possible value from the interval for $A_{L1}$. This defines the interval for the onset age, $I_{onset}$.\n$$I_{onset} = [\\min(A_{L2}), \\max(A_{L1})] = [469.88, 470.64] \\text{ Ma}$$\n\nSimilarly, the cessation horizon, with age $T_{cessation}$, is between beds $U_1$ and $U_2$. It must be younger than $U_1$ and older than $U_2$. This gives the inequality $A_{U2} < T_{cessation} < A_{U1}$. The conservative interval for the cessation age, $I_{cessation}$, is defined by the minimum of $A_{U2}$'s interval and the maximum of $A_{U1}$'s interval.\n$$I_{cessation} = [\\min(A_{U2}), \\max(A_{U1})] = [468.03, 468.55] \\text{ Ma}$$\n\nThe duration of the GOBE pulse is defined as $D = T_{onset} - T_{cessation}$. To find the minimum and maximum possible values for this duration, we must perform interval subtraction on $I_{onset}$ and $I_{cessation}$.\n\nThe minimum duration, $D_{min}$, is obtained by subtracting the maximum possible cessation age from the minimum possible onset age:\n$$D_{min} = \\min(I_{onset}) - \\max(I_{cessation}) = 469.88 \\text{ Ma} - 468.55 \\text{ Ma} = 1.33 \\text{ Myr}$$\n\nThe maximum duration, $D_{max}$, is obtained by subtracting the minimum possible cessation age from the maximum possible onset age:\n$$D_{max} = \\max(I_{onset}) - \\min(I_{cessation}) = 470.64 \\text{ Ma} - 468.03 \\text{ Ma} = 2.61 \\text{ Myr}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answers to be rounded to three significant figures. Both results, $1.33$ and $2.61$, are already in this form.

Consider the following realistic Ordovician example focused on marine invertebrate genera, with the intent that the identical protocol could be applied to plant palynomorph genera to enable cross-domain comparison. You have three consecutive stages with pooled occurrence data aggregated at the stage level. The basic starting points are: sampling coverage sensu Good and Turing, with the Good’s coverage estimator given by $\\hat{C} = 1 - f_{1}/n$, where $n$ is the total number of occurrences and $f_{1}$ is the number of singleton genera (those occurring exactly once); and the definition of a “shareholder” in Shareholder Quorum Subsampling (SQS), where the share of genus $i$ is $p_{i} = f_{i}/n$ and the cumulative coverage of a set of sampled genera is the sum of their shares.\n\nStage-level data:\n- Floian: total occurrences $n_{\\mathrm{Fl}} = 80$, singletons $f_{1,\\mathrm{Fl}} = 28$.\n- Dapingian: total occurrences $n_{\\mathrm{Da}} = 400$, singletons $f_{1,\\mathrm{Da}} = 60$.

Assume per-stage sampling is spatially mixed such that pooled occurrence frequencies are ecologically interpretable, and that the same workflow would be applied independently to plant palynomorphs to compare botanical and zoological trends.\n\nWhich option correctly describes the procedure and gives the resulting standardized richness trend for these data under Shareholder Quorum Subsampling (SQS) at $q = 0.7$?\n\nA. For each stage, compute $\\hat{C}$; drop stages with $\\hat{C} < q$; within retained stages, repeatedly sample genera without replacement with selection probability proportional to $p_{i}$ until the cumulative share of unique genera first meets or exceeds $q$; the number of unique genera at that point is the standardized richness for that trial. Average over many trials to obtain an estimate and uncertainty. For Dapingian, the cumulative shares of the most common genera reach $0.72$ at the tenth genus, so the standardized richness is approximately $10$; for Darriwilian, the cumulative shares reach $0.70$ at the twelfth genus, so the standardized richness is approximately $12$; the Floian is excluded because $\\hat{C}_{\\mathrm{Fl}} = 1 - 28/80 = 0.65 < 0.7$. The resulting trend shows an increase from approximately $10$ to $12$ genera from Dapingian to Darriwilian, consistent with a GOBE rise.\n\nB. Pool all stages and equalize by subsampling to the same number of collections per stage; then count distinct genera without using coverage estimates. Because Darriwilian has the most even leading shares, it will have a lower standardized richness than Dapingian at $q = 0.7$, so Dapingian will have approximately $12$ and Darriwilian $10$, and Floian will be retained regardless of $\\hat{C}$.\n\nC. For each stage, set an adaptive quorum $q' = \\min(q,\\hat{C})$ so that even undercovered stages are analyzed; then, for Floian with $\\hat{C}_{\\mathrm{Fl}} = 0.65$, use $q' = 0.65$ and for the other stages use $q' = 0.7$. Include genera in descending order of abundance until the cumulative share meets $q'$. This ensures all stages are retained and yields a strictly unbiased comparison across stages even when $\\hat{C} < q$.\n\nD. For each stage, compute the abundance-based Chao $1$ estimator and take that as the standardized richness without subsampling or coverage matching. Because Chao $1$ adjusts for singletons via $f_{1}$ and doubletons $f_{2}$, it inherently corrects for sample-size differences and is equivalent to SQS at $q = 0.7$, so the reported richness will match the SQS counts that include approximately $12$ genera for Dapingian and $10$ for Darriwilian, with all stages retained regardless of $\\hat{C}$.", "solution": "The problem requires the application of the Shareholder Quorum Subsampling (SQS) method to compare genus richness across three Ordovician stages at a fixed quorum of $q = 0.7$.

The Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event is a major subject of paleontological research. The methods cited—Good's coverage estimator and Shareholder Quorum Subsampling—are established techniques in quantitative ecology and paleobiology for standardizing sampling effort. The data provided are internally consistent and plausible for paleontological occurrence datasets. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient information to apply the specified method and evaluate the options. The terminology is precise and objective. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles of mathematics or biology. It is a straightforward application of a known statistical procedure.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with a full derivation and analysis.\n\n**Derivation of Standardized Richness**\n\nThe SQS protocol proceeds in two stages.\n\n**First Stage: Coverage Assessment**\nThe sample coverage for each stage is calculated using Good's estimator, $\\hat{C} = 1 - f_1/n$. A stage is retained for analysis only if its sample coverage $\\hat{C}$ is greater than or equal to the specified quorum $q$. Here, $q = 0.7$.\n\n- **Floian Stage:**\n$n_{\\mathrm{Fl}} = 80$, $f_{1,\\mathrm{Fl}} = 28$.\n$$\\hat{C}_{\\mathrm{Fl}} = 1 - \\frac{f_{1,\\mathrm{Fl}}}{n_{\\mathrm{Fl}}} = 1 - \\frac{28}{80} = 1 - 0.35 = 0.65.$$\nSince $\\hat{C}_{\\mathrm{Fl}} = 0.65 < 0.7$, the Floian stage has insufficient sampling coverage to be standardized to the quorum of $q=0.7$. Therefore, it must be excluded from the comparison.\n\n- **Dapingian Stage:**\n$n_{\\mathrm{Da}} = 400$, $f_{1,\\mathrm{Da}} = 60$.\n$$\\hat{C}_{\\mathrm{Da}} = 1 - \\frac{f_{1,\\mathrm{Da}}}{n_{\\mathrm{Da}}} = 1 - \\frac{60}{400} = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.$$\nSince $\\hat{C}_{\\mathrm{Da}} = 0.85 \\ge 0.7$, the Dapingian stage is retained for analysis.\n\n- **Darriwilian Stage:**\n$n_{\\mathrm{Dr}} = 1200$, $f_{1,\\mathrm{Dr}} = 90$.\n$$\\hat{C}_{\\mathrm{Dr}} = 1 - \\frac{f_{1,\\mathrm{Dr}}}{n_{\\mathrm{Dr}}} = 1 - \\frac{90}{1200} = 1 - 0.075 = 0.925.$$\nSince $\\hat{C}_{\\mathrm{Dr}} = 0.925 \\ge 0.7$, the Darriwilian stage is also retained for analysis.\n\n**Second Stage: Richness Calculation at Quorum**\nFor the retained stages, the standardized richness is the number of most abundant genera whose cumulative frequency shares, $p_i$, sum to meet or exceed the quorum $q=0.7$. We sum the provided shares in descending order.\n\n- **Dapingian Richness at $q=0.7$:**\nThe shares are $\\{0.16,\\,0.12,\\,0.10,\\,0.08,\\,0.06,\\,0.05,\\,0.05,\\,0.04,\\,0.03,\\,0.03,\\, \\ldots\\}$.\nThe cumulative sums of shares are:\n - $1$ genus: $0.16$\n - $2$ genera: $0.16 + 0.12 = 0.28$\n - $3$ genera: $0.28 + 0.10 = 0.38$\n - $4$ genera: $0.38 + 0.08 = 0.46$\n - $5$ genera: $0.46 + 0.06 = 0.52$\n - $6$ genera: $0.52 + 0.05 = 0.57$\n - $7$ genera: $0.57 + 0.05 = 0.62$\n - $8$ genera: $0.62 + 0.04 = 0.66$\n - $9$ genera: $0.66 + 0.03 = 0.69$\n - $10$ genera: $0.69 + 0.03 = 0.72$\nThe cumulative share first meets or exceeds $0.7$ with the inclusion of the 10th genus. Thus, the SQS richness for the Dapingian is $10$.\n\n- **Darriwilian Richness at $q=0.7$:**\nThe shares are $\\{0.10,\\,0.09,\\,0.08,\\,0.07,\\,0.06,\\,0.06,\\,0.05,\\,0.05,\\,0.04,\\,0.04,\\,0.03,\\,0.03,\\,0.03,\\, \\ldots\\}$.\nThe cumulative sums of shares are:\n - $1$ genus: $0.10$\n - $2$ genera: $0.10 + 0.09 = 0.19$\n - $3$ genera: $0.19 + 0.08 = 0.27$\n - $4$ genera: $0.27 + 0.07 = 0.34$\n - $5$ genera: $0.34 + 0.06 = 0.40$\n - $6$ genera: $0.40 + 0.06 = 0.46$\n - $7$ genera: $0.46 + 0.05 = 0.51$\n - $8$ genera: $0.51 + 0.05 = 0.56$\n - $9$ genera: $0.56 + 0.04 = 0.60$\n - $10$ genera: $0.60 + 0.04 = 0.64$\n - $11$ genera: $0.64 + 0.03 = 0.67$\n - $12$ genera: $0.67 + 0.03 = 0.70$\nThe cumulative share first meets or exceeds $0.7$ with the inclusion of the 12th genus. Thus, the SQS richness for the Darriwilian is $12$.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation**\nThe SQS analysis excludes the Floian stage. It shows an increase in standardized genus richness from $10$ in the Dapingian to $12$ in the Darriwilian.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A.** This option correctly states that one must first compute $\\hat{C}$ and drop stages where $\\hat{C} < q$. It correctly calculates $\\hat{C}_{\\mathrm{Fl}} = 1 - 28/80 = 0.65$ and correctly concludes that the Floian stage is excluded. It correctly calculates that for the Dapingian, the cumulative share of the top ten genera is $0.72$, yielding a richness of approximately $10$. It correctly calculates that for the Darriwilian, the cumulative share of the top twelve genera is $0.70$, yielding a richness of approximately $12$. Finally, it correctly identifies the trend as an increase from $10$ to $12$, consistent with a GOBE rise. The description of the subsampling procedure is slightly muddled, describing a stochastic trial-based method but then using a simpler deterministic calculation, but this does not alter the correctness of the fundamental steps and the final numerical result. **Correct.**\n\n**B.** This option proposes an entirely incorrect procedure. It suggests pooling stages and using classical rarefaction, which is not SQS. It incorrectly states that Floian will be retained, ignoring the mandatory coverage check. It asserts that Dapingian richness ($12$) is higher than Darriwilian ($10$), the reverse of the correct result. Its ecological reasoning that higher evenness leads to lower richness for a fixed quorum is fundamentally flawed; the opposite is true. For a target cumulative frequency share, a more even distribution requires summing more taxa, thus yielding higher richness. **Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** This option proposes an \"adaptive quorum\" $q' = \\min(q,\\hat{C})$. This violates the principle of standardization, which is to compare samples at a *common* benchmark. Comparing a richness value at $q=0.65$ to one at $q=0.7$ is not a valid, unbiased comparison; it is precisely the kind of error that the strict quorum rule of SQS is designed to prevent. The claim that this method \"yields a strictly unbiased comparison\" is false. **Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** This option erroneously conflates SQS with the Chao $1$ asymptotic richness estimator. These are fundamentally different metrics: SQS measures richness at a specified level of sample completeness, while Chao $1$ attempts to estimate total richness, including unobserved taxa. The claim that Chao $1$ is \"equivalent to SQS at $q=0.7$\" is baseless. Furthermore, the Chao $1$ estimator requires the count of doubletons ($f_2$), which is not provided in the problem statement. It also reverses the correct richness trend, similar to option B, and incorrectly retains the Floian stage. **Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2616930"}, {"introduction": "To move from documenting the GOBE to explaining it, we must test hypotheses about its potential environmental drivers.
