Consider a single vertical, turgid stem modeled as a slender, homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic circular cylinder of length $L$, radius $r$, and density $\\rho$. The base is rigidly fixed to the ground and the tip is free. The stem experiences a compressive force equal to its own weight due to gravity $g$.

It presents a well-posed problem in the field of biomechanics, grounded in the principles of solid mechanics and elasticity theory. The problem asks for the application of Euler buckling theory to a simplified model of a plant stem. The loading condition, described as \"compressive force equal to its own weight\", is interpreted as a standard simplification wherein the total weight of the column is treated as an equivalent concentrated axial load applied at the free tip. This is a common and conservative assumption in introductory stability analysis. With this clarification, the problem is self-contained, scientifically sound, and permits a unique solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds in four stages as requested.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the critical buckling load $P_{\\mathrm{cr}}$. The classical Euler formula for the critical load of a slender column is:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{cr}} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{(K L)^2}$$\nHere, $E$ is the Young's modulus, $I$ is the second moment of area of the column's cross-section, $L$ is the length, and $K$ is the effective length factor determined by the boundary conditions. For a column with a base that is rigidly fixed and a tip that is free, the effective length factor is $K=2$. Substituting this into the formula gives:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{cr}} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{(2L)^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{4L^2}$$\nThe stem is modeled as a circular cylinder of radius $r$. The second moment of area for a circular cross-section is:\n$$I = \\frac{\\pi r^4}{4}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $I$ into the formula for $P_{\\mathrm{cr}}$ yields:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{cr}} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E}{4L^2} \\left( \\frac{\\pi r^4}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi^3 E r^4}{16L^2}$$\nThe problem provides a model for the effective Young's modulus, $E(f)$, which depends on the lignification fraction $f$:\n$$E(f) = E_{0} + f E_{\\ell}$$\nReplacing the generic modulus $E$ with $E(f)$, we obtain the final expression for the critical load as a function of the lignification fraction:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{cr}}(f) = \\frac{\\pi^3 (E_{0} + f E_{\\ell}) r^4}{16L^2}$$\n\nSecond, we incorporate the safety requirement. The analysis must ensure that the critical buckling load is greater than or equal to the stem's own weight, $W$, multiplied by a safety factor $\\eta$. The condition is stated as:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{cr}} \\ge \\eta W$$\nThe weight $W$ of the cylindrical stem is its volume multiplied by its density $\\rho$ and the acceleration due to gravity $g$. The volume, $V$, is the cross-sectional area $A = \\pi r^2$ times the length $L$.\n$$W = \\rho g V = \\rho g (\\pi r^2 L)$$\nThe safety requirement thus becomes:\n$$\\frac{\\pi^3 (E_{0} + f E_{\\ell}) r^4}{16L^2} \\ge \\eta (\\rho g \\pi r^2 L)$$\n\nThird, we solve for the minimal lignification fraction, $f_{\\min}$. This minimum value is found when the equality in the safety condition holds:\n$$\\frac{\\pi^3 (E_{0} + f_{\\min} E_{\\ell}) r^4}{16L^2} = \\eta \\rho g \\pi r^2 L$$\nWe proceed to solve this equation for $f_{\\min}$. We can simplify by cancelling common factors. Dividing both sides by $\\pi r^2$ gives:\n$$\\frac{\\pi^2 (E_{0} + f_{\\min} E_{\\ell}) r^2}{16L^2} = \\eta \\rho g L$$\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate the term containing $f_{\\min}$:\n$$E_{0} + f_{\\min} E_{\\ell} = \\frac{16 \\eta \\rho g L^3}{\\pi^2 r^2}$$\n$$f_{\\min} E_{\\ell} = \\frac{16 \\eta \\rho g L^3}{\\pi^2 r^2} - E_{0}$$\nFinally, dividing by $E_{\\ell}$ gives the analytical expression for the minimal lignification fraction:\n$$f_{\\min} = \\frac{1}{E_{\\ell}} \\left( \\frac{16 \\eta \\rho g L^3}{\\pi^2 r^2} - E_{0} \\right)$$\nThis expression is valid only if the right-hand side is non-negative, which corresponds to the physical requirement that some lignification is necessary for stability. If the expression is negative, it implies that the unlignified stem ($f=0$) is already stable, and thus $f_{\\min} = 0$.\n\nFourth, we evaluate $f_{\\min}$ numerically using the provided parameter values:\n$L = 0.40\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$r = 2.50 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$\\rho = 1.00 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\n$g = 9.81\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$\n$\\eta = 2.0$\n$E_{0} = 8.0 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n$E_{\\ell} = 8.0 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n\nWe first compute the term $\\frac{16 \\eta \\rho g L^3}{\\pi^2 r^2}$:\n$$ \\frac{16 (2.0) (1.00 \\times 10^{3}) (9.81) (0.40)^3}{\\pi^2 (2.50 \\times 10^{-3})^2} = \\frac{16 \\times 2.0 \\times 1000 \\times 9.81 \\times 0.064}{\\pi^2 \\times 6.25 \\times 10^{-6}} = \\frac{20090.88}{6.1685 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 3.2570 \\times 10^{8}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$$\nNow, substitute this value along with $E_{0}$ and $E_{\\ell}$ into the expression for $f_{\\min}$:\n$$f_{\\min} = \\frac{1}{8.0 \\times 10^{9}} \\left( 3.2570 \\times 10^{8} - 8.0 \\times 10^{6} \\right)$$\n$$f_{\\min} = \\frac{1}{8.0 \\times 10^{9}} \\left( 3.2570 \\times 10^{8} - 0.080 \\times 10^{8} \\right)$$\n$$f_{\\min} = \\frac{3.1770 \\times 10^{8}}{8.0 \\times 10^{9}} = \\frac{3.1770}{80} \\approx 0.0397125$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$f_{\\min} \\approx 0.0397$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0397}$$", "id": "2614651"}, {"introduction": "Surviving on land demands a watertight barrier to prevent desiccation in dry air, a major selective pressure that drove the evolution of the plant cuticle.

The terms $C$, $r^3$ (for $r > 0$), and $\\exp(-\\lambda r^{\\beta})$ are all strictly positive. Therefore, the derivative is zero only if the term in the parenthesis is zero:\n$$\n4 - \\lambda \\beta (r^{\\star})^{\\beta} = 0\n$$\nwhere $r^{\\star}$ is the optimal radius. We now solve for $r^{\\star}$:\n$$\n\\lambda \\beta (r^{\\star})^{\\beta} = 4\n$$\n$$\n(r^{\\star})^{\\beta} = \\frac{4}{\\lambda \\beta}\n$$\nTaking the $\\beta$-th root of both sides yields the expression for the optimal radius:\n$$\nr^{\\star} = \\left( \\frac{4}{\\lambda \\beta} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\beta}}\n$$\nThis critical point corresponds to a global maximum for $r > 0$. This is confirmed by observing that the sign of the derivative is determined by the sign of $(4 - \\lambda \\beta r^{\\beta})$. For $r < r^{\\star}$, the derivative is positive, so the function is increasing. For $r > r^{\\star}$, the derivative is negative, so the function is decreasing. This confirms that $r^{\\star}$ is a unique maximum.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{4}{\\lambda \\beta}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\beta}}}$$", "id": "2614640"}]}
