{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The evolution of sterile worker castes, the hallmark of eusociality, presents a central paradox in Darwinian evolution: how can altruistic self-sacrifice be favored by natural selection? This foundational practice guides you through the logic of W.D. Hamilton's inclusive fitness theory to resolve this puzzle. By deriving the famous Hamilton's rule, you will quantify the precise relationship between the benefits ($b$), costs ($c$), and genetic relatedness ($r$) of a social act, revealing the mathematical basis for the evolution of helping [@problem_id:2570362].", "problem": "A comparative question in the evolution of social behavior: Consider a rare allele at a social locus in a large, well-mixed population that causes a worker to forego its own reproduction and instead perform a helping action directed at nestmates. Assume weak selection and additive fitness effects. Let the direct fitness cost to the actor be $c$ and the total additive fitness benefit delivered to recipients (summed over all recipients of the helping act) be $b$, both measured as expected numbers of viable gene copies transmitted to the next generation. Let $r$ denote the genetic relatedness (probability of identity by descent at the social locus) between the actor and a randomly chosen recipient of the help. Under the inclusive fitness framework, a social allele increases in frequency when the expected change in inclusive fitness due to the act is positive.\n\nStarting from the definition that inclusive fitness is the sum of the actor’s direct fitness effect and the relatedness-weighted indirect fitness effects on recipients, derive the threshold condition on the benefit-to-cost ratio $b/c$ required for the helping allele to be favored by natural selection in terms of $r$. Then, compute this minimum $b/c$ for $r=0.25$, $r=0.50$, and $r=0.75$. Finally, briefly interpret each threshold in biological terms appropriate to termites (diploid) and Hymenoptera (haplodiploid), focusing on how the magnitude of $r$ changes the stringency of the helping threshold.\n\nReport the three thresholds in the order $r=0.25$, $r=0.50$, $r=0.75$.

D. Hamilton. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a complete derivation. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the condition under which a rare allele for altruistic helping behavior can increase in frequency. The foundation for this derivation is the concept of inclusive fitness. The change in an actor's inclusive fitness, denoted as $\\Delta W_{\\text{incl}}$, is defined as the sum of the direct fitness effect on the actor and the indirect fitness effects on all recipients, with the latter being weighted by the coefficient of genetic relatedness, $r$.\n\nThe givens are:\n- The direct fitness cost to the actor is $c$. This represents a decrease in the actor's own reproductive success. Thus, the direct fitness effect is $-c$.\n- The total additive fitness benefit conferred upon all recipients is $b$.\n- The genetic relatedness between the actor and a randomly chosen recipient of the help is $r$.\n\nThe indirect fitness component is the effect of the actor's behavior on the fitness of its relatives, weighted by how related they are. The total benefit $b$ is distributed among recipients to whom the actor is related by $r$. Therefore, the value of this benefit, from the perspective of the actor's genes, is $r \\times b$.\n\nWe can now construct the expression for the change in inclusive fitness:\n$$\n\\Delta W_{\\text{incl}} = (\\text{Direct Fitness Effect}) + (\\text{Indirect Fitness Effect})\n$$\nSubstituting the given components, we have:\n$$\n\\Delta W_{\\text{incl}} = -c + rb\n$$\nThe problem states that the social (helping) allele will be favored by natural selection and increase in frequency when the expected change in inclusive fitness is positive. This gives us the condition:\n$$\n\\Delta W_{\\text{incl}} > 0\n$$\nSubstituting our expression for $\\Delta W_{\\text{incl}}$:\n$$\n-c + rb > 0\n$$\nThis inequality is the core of Hamilton's rule. To find the threshold condition on the benefit-to-cost ratio, $\\frac{b}{c}$, we must rearrange this inequality. We assume $c > 0$ and $r \\ge 0$, which are biologically necessary for the problem to be meaningful.\n$$\nrb > c\n$$\nSince $c$ is a positive cost, we can divide by $c$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{b}{c} > \\frac{1}{r}\n$$\nThis is the threshold condition required for the helping allele to be favored by selection. The ratio of the benefit to the recipients to the cost to the actor must exceed the inverse of the coefficient of relatedness.\n\nNow, we must compute the minimum value for this ratio for the specified values of $r$: $r=0.25$, $r=0.50$, and $r=0.75$. The minimum threshold is the value $\\frac{1}{r}$.\n\nCase 1: $r = 0.25$\nThe minimum benefit-to-cost ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{b}{c} = \\frac{1}{0.25} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{4}} = 4\n$$\n\nCase 2: $r = 0.50$\nThe minimum benefit-to-cost ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{b}{c} = \\frac{1}{0.50} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2\n$$\n\nCase 3: $r = 0.75$\nThe minimum benefit-to-cost ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{b}{c} = \\frac{1}{0.75} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{4}{3}\n$$\n\nFinally, we interpret these thresholds. The condition $\\frac{b}{c} > \\frac{1}{r}$ demonstrates that the \"price\" of altruism is inversely proportional to relatedness. As relatedness $r$ decreases, the required benefit $b$ for a given cost $c$ must be substantially higher for the behavior to be evolutionarily advantageous.\n\n- For $r = 0.75$ ($\\frac{b}{c} > \\frac{4}{3}$): This high degree of relatedness is characteristic of full sisters in haplodiploid species such as Hymenoptera (ants, bees, wasps). A female passes on half her genes to an offspring ($r=0.5$), but she shares, on average, three-quarters of her genes with a full sister ($r=0.75$). Consequently, the threshold for helping a sister ($\\frac{b}{c} > \\frac{4}{3}$) is less stringent than the threshold for raising an offspring ($\\frac{b}{c} > \\frac{1}{0.5} = 2$). This asymmetry, known as the \"haplodiploidy hypothesis,\" provides a powerful explanation for the frequent evolution of eusociality with sterile female castes in this order. A female worker can gain more inclusive fitness by helping her mother produce more sisters than by producing her own offspring.\n\n- For $r = 0.50$ ($\\frac{b}{c} > 2$): This is the standard relatedness between full siblings in diploid organisms, such as termites, or between a parent and offspring in any sexually reproducing species. For altruism to evolve, the benefit to a sibling must be more than double the cost to the actor. This is a significant hurdle, but it is met in many monogamous family groups where cooperative breeding and helping at the nest have evolved.\n\n- For $r = 0.25$ ($\\frac{b}{c} > 4$): This lower relatedness corresponds to half-siblings (sharing one parent), or between an individual and its nieces or nephews. The condition for altruism becomes very strict: the benefit must be more than four times the cost. This high threshold explains why altruism is much less likely to evolve when directed at more distant relatives.\n\nIn summary, the magnitude of $r$ fundamentally alters the evolutionary calculus of social behavior, with higher relatedness significantly lowering the barrier for the evolution of self-sacrificial helping. The unique genetic system of Hymenoptera creates exceptionally high relatedness among sisters, providing a strong pre-disposition for the evolution of altruistic worker castes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 2 & \\frac{4}{3} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2570362"}, {"introduction": "While high relatedness can foster cooperation, asymmetries in genetic relatedness within a colony can also generate conflict. This exercise explores a classic example of this: worker policing in Hymenoptera, where workers may destroy eggs laid by other workers. By applying inclusive fitness reasoning, you will determine the conditions under which this behavior is evolutionarily favored, linking it directly to the queen's mating frequency ($m$) and the resulting shifts in colony kinship structure [@problem_id:2570391].", "problem": "In a haplodiploid Hymenopteran colony (for example, ants, bees, or wasps) where the queen mates with exactly $m$ males, consider a rare mutant worker trait that causes its bearer to police by removing a small number $\\delta$ of worker-laid male eggs. Assume the following biologically standard and widely accepted foundations:\n\n- Under haplodiploidy, a female is related to her own son by $r_{\\text{son}} = \\frac{1}{2}$ and to her brother (a queen’s son) by $r_{\\text{brother}} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n- The queen’s multiple mating results in a mixture of full sisters and half sisters among workers, with a worker being a full sister of a randomly chosen worker with probability $\\frac{1}{m}$ and a half sister with probability $\\frac{m-1}{m}$. Full sisters have relatedness $r_{\\text{full}} = \\frac{3}{4}$ and half sisters have relatedness $r_{\\text{half}} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n- The inclusive fitness criterion (Hamilton’s rule) holds: a trait spreads when the sum over effects on recipients of benefits weighted by relatedness minus costs weighted by relatedness to the actor is positive.\n\nModel the policing action as follows:\n\n- Each removed worker-laid male egg is replaced one-to-one by a queen-laid male egg, i.e., male output is conserved at one-to-one replacement.\n- The policing worker pays a direct fecundity cost: per worker-laid egg removed, her expected production of her own sons is reduced by $\\kappa$ (so the total expected loss across $\\delta$ removals is $\\kappa \\delta$ sons).\n- The removed worker-laid male is a nephew (a son of another worker).

It is a standard, formalizable problem in theoretical biology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe invasion condition for the policing allele is determined using Hamilton's rule. We construct the inclusive fitness budget for a single act of policing: the removal of one worker-laid male egg. The allele for policing will spread if the net change in the actor's inclusive fitness, $\\Delta W_I$, is positive.\n\nThe inclusive fitness change can be calculated from the perspective of the actor's genes. $\\Delta W_I$ is the sum of fitness benefits and costs, where each component is weighted by the actor's relatedness to the individual experiencing the fitness change. The calculation is organized as follows: benefit minus costs.\n\n$\\Delta W_I = (\\text{Inclusive Fitness Gain}) - (\\text{Inclusive Fitness Loss}) > 0$\n\nThe components of the fitness change are:\n1.  **Cost ($C$)**: The actor pays a direct fecundity cost. She loses an expected $\\kappa$ sons. The actor's relatedness to her own son is $r_{\\text{son}} = \\frac{1}{2}$. The inclusive fitness cost is the value of the lost offspring from the actor's gene's perspective:\n    $$C = \\kappa \\times r_{\\text{son}} = \\kappa \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\n2.  **Benefit ($B$) and Loss ($L$) from Egg Replacement**: The policing act replaces a worker-laid male egg with a queen-laid male egg.\n    - The actor loses a nephew. The inclusive fitness loss ($L$) is the actor's relatedness to this nephew, $r_{\\text{nephew}}$.\n    - The actor gains a brother. The inclusive fitness benefit ($B$) is the actor's relatedness to her brother, $r_{\\text{brother}}$.\n\nWe must first compute the actor's relatedness to her nephew. This requires the actor's average relatedness to the nephew's mother (another worker). Let this average worker-worker relatedness be $r_{\\text{ww}}$.\nUsing the provided probabilities and relatedness values:\n$$r_{\\text{ww}} = P(\\text{full sister}) \\times r_{\\text{full}} + P(\\text{half sister}) \\times r_{\\text{half}}$$\n$$r_{\\text{ww}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{m}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{m-1}{m}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{3 + m - 1}{4m} = \\frac{m+2}{4m}$$\nThe nephew is a son of this worker. A mother is related to her son by $r_{\\text{son}} = \\frac{1}{2}$. The actor's relatedness to her nephew is the product of her relatedness to the nephew's mother and the mother's relatedness to her son:\n$$r_{\\text{nephew}} = r_{\\text{ww}} \\times r_{\\text{son}} = \\left(\\frac{m+2}{4m}\\right) \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{m+2}{8m}$$\n\nThe actor's relatedness to her brother (a son of the queen) is given as $r_{\\text{brother}} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nNow we can formulate the full inclusive fitness inequality for the policing trait to invade:\n$$\\Delta W_I = B - L - C > 0$$\n$$\\Delta W_I = r_{\\text{brother}} - r_{\\text{nephew}} - \\kappa \\frac{1}{2} > 0$$\nSubstituting the derived and given relatedness values:\n$$\\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{m+2}{8m} - \\frac{\\kappa}{2} > 0$$\nTo find the condition on $\\kappa$, we rearrange the inequality to isolate $\\kappa$:\n$$\\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{m+2}{8m} > \\frac{\\kappa}{2}$$\nWe simplify the left-hand side by finding a common denominator, which is $8m$:\n$$\\frac{2m}{8m} - \\frac{m+2}{8m} > \\frac{\\kappa}{2}$$\n$$\\frac{2m - (m+2)}{8m} > \\frac{\\kappa}{2}$$\n$$\\frac{m-2}{8m} > \\frac{\\kappa}{2}$$\nFinally, we solve for $\\kappa$ by multiplying both sides by $2$:\n$$\\kappa < \\frac{2(m-2)}{8m}$$\n$$\\kappa < \\frac{m-2}{4m}$$\nThe policing trait increases in frequency when the cost $\\kappa$ is less than this value. The maximum tolerable cost, $\\kappa^{\\ast}(m)$, is the threshold at which the net inclusive fitness effect is zero.\nTherefore, the expression for the maximum tolerable cost is:\n$$\\kappa^{\\ast}(m) = \\frac{m-2}{4m}$$\nThis result shows that worker policing is only favored ($\\kappa^{\\ast}(m) > 0$) when the queen mates with more than two males ($m > 2$), a classic result in the study of social insects.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{m-2}{4m}}$$", "id": "2570391"}, {"introduction": "The theoretical models of kin selection and social conflict all hinge on a critical parameter: the coefficient of relatedness, $r$.

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe primary task is to determine the mean pairwise relatedness, $\\bar r$, among a sample of $N=6$ worker insects from a haplodiploid species. This requires first reconstructing the patrilines (groups of full sisters) within the sample. The principle of this reconstruction rests on the genetics of Hymenoptera. A diploid female worker receives one set of chromosomes from her diploid mother (the queen) and one set from her haploid father (a male, or sire). At any given locus, a worker's genotype consists of one maternal allele and one paternal allele. Since the queen's genotype is known, the paternal allele for each worker can be deduced. All daughters of the same father must share the same paternal allele at a given locus.\n\nWe apply this principle to the provided genotypes at four unlinked microsatellite loci, $L_1, L_2, L_3, L_4$. The queen's genotype is denoted $Q$. Worker genotypes are denoted $W_i$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.

The total number of unique, unordered worker pairs is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{N}{2}$:\n$$ \\text{Total pairs} = \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15 $$\nThese $15$ pairs are of two types: full-sister pairs and half-sister pairs.\nThe problem states the coefficient of relatedness for full sisters is $r_{\\text{full}} = 0.75$, and for half-sisters is $r_{\\text{half}} = 0.25$.\n\n1.  **Number of full-sister pairs ($N_{\\text{full}}$):** These are pairs where both workers belong to the same patriline.\n    - Within Patriline 1 (size $n_1=3$): $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ pairs.\n    - Within Patriline 2 (size $n_2=3$): $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ pairs.\n    - Total full-sister pairs: $N_{\\text{full}} = 3 + 3 = 6$.\n\n2.  **Number of half-sister pairs ($N_{\\text{half}}$):** These are pairs with one worker from each patriline.\n    - Number of pairs between Patriline 1 and Patriline 2: $n_1 \\times n_2 = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n    - Alternatively, $N_{\\text{half}} = \\binom{N}{2} - N_{\\text{full}} = 15 - 6 = 9$.\n\nThe mean relatedness $\\bar r$ is the sum of the relatedness coefficients for all pairs, divided by the total number of pairs.\n$$ \\bar r = \\frac{(N_{\\text{full}} \\times r_{\\text{full}}) + (N_{\\text{half}} \\times r_{\\text{half}})}{N_{\\text{full}} + N_{\\text{half}}} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\bar r = \\frac{(6 \\times 0.75) + (9 \\times 0.25)}{15} $$\n$$ \\bar r = \\frac{4.5 + 2.25}{15} $$\n$$ \\bar r = \\frac{6.75}{15} $$\n$$ \\bar r = 0.45 $$\nThis value is the exact mean pairwise relatedness for this specific sample. It is noted that this differs from the value obtained from the general formula for large populations with a queen mated to $m$ males with equal paternity, $\\bar{r} = 0.25 + 0.5/m$. For $m=2$, that formula yields $\\bar{r}=0.5$. The discrepancy arises because the general formula is an asymptotic approximation for large populations, whereas our calculation is an exact value for a small, finite sample. The probability that a randomly chosen nestmate is a full sister for a focal worker in this sample is precisely $\\frac{n_i-1}{N-1} = \\frac{3-1}{6-1} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4$, not $1/m=0.5$. Our calculation is therefore the correct one as per the problem's requirement to compute $\\bar r$ **in this sample**.\n\nThe final answer, rounded to four significant figures, is $0.4500$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4500}$$", "id": "2570379"}]}
