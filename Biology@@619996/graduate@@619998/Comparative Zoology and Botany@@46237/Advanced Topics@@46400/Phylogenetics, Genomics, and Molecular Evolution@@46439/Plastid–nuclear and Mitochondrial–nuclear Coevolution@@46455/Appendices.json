Complex IV comprises both mitochondrial-encoded and nuclear-encoded subunits whose stoichiometry must be matched for efficient assembly and function. From the core principles of gene expression and protein complex assembly, when expression levels are tuned to an optimum, small deviations around that optimum produce second-order effects on fitness because first-order deviations cancel at the optimum. Consequently, for small stoichiometric imbalances between mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded subunits, it is standard to approximate the unitless relative fitness penalty by a quadratic function of the fractional excess of one class of subunits.\n\nIn a clade-wide assay, the nuclear-encoded subunits of Complex IV are measured to be in excess by a fraction $0.20$ relative to mitochondrial-encoded subunits. Assume the near-optimum unitless fitness penalty scales with the square of the stoichiometric excess with proportionality constant $c$, and that $c=0.5$ for this system.

This requires determining the frequencies of all mitonuclear genotypes in the F2 generation before selection.\n\n**1. F1 Generation Genotypes**\nThe F1 generation is produced from two reciprocal crosses in equal proportions.\n\n- Cross 1: Female $A$ ($m_{A}, n_{A}n_{A}$) $\\times$ Male $B$ ($m_{B}, n_{B}n_{B}$).\n  - Offspring inherit mitochondria from the mother, receiving $m_{A}$.\n  - Offspring receive a gamete with allele $n_{A}$ from the mother and a gamete with allele $n_{B}$ from the father.\n  - The resulting genotype is $(m_{A}, n_{A}n_{B})$.\n\n- Cross 2: Female $B$ ($m_{B}, n_{B}n_{B}$) $\\times$ Male $A$ ($m_{A}, n_{A}n_{A}$).\n  - Offspring inherit mitochondria from the mother, receiving $m_{B}$.\n  - Offspring receive a gamete with allele $n_{B}$ from the mother and a gamete with allele $n_{A}$ from the father.\n  - The resulting genotype is $(m_{B}, n_{A}n_{B})$.\n\nThe pooled F1 population, produced in equal numbers from these crosses, consists of $1/2$ individuals of genotype $(m_{A}, n_{A}n_{B})$ and $1/2$ individuals of genotype $(m_{B}, n_{A}n_{B})$. Note that all F1 individuals are heterozygous $n_{A}n_{B}$ at the nuclear locus.\n\n**2. F2 Generation Zygote Frequencies**\nThe F2 generation is produced by random intercrossing of the pooled F1 individuals. We must determine the frequencies of gametes produced by the F1 population.\n\n- **Nuclear Alleles:** All F1 individuals, both male and female, have the nuclear genotype $n_{A}n_{B}$. Due to Mendelian segregation, they produce gametes containing allele $n_{A}$ with frequency $p = \\frac{1}{2}$ and allele $n_{B}$ with frequency $q = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n- **Mitochondrial Haplotypes:** Mitochondria are inherited maternally. The F1 female population consists of $1/2$ individuals with haplotype $m_{A}$ and $1/2$ with haplotype $m_{B}$. Therefore, $1/2$ of the F2 zygotes will inherit $m_{A}$ and $1/2$ will inherit $m_{B}$.\n\nUnder random mating, the frequencies of nuclear genotypes in the F2 generation will follow Hardy-Weinberg proportions:\n- Frequency of $n_{A}n_{A}$ = $p^2 = (\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n- Frequency of $n_{A}n_{B}$ = $2pq = 2(\\frac{1}{2})(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Frequency of $n_{B}n_{B}$ = $q^2 = (\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nSince mitochondrial inheritance is independent of nuclear segregation in this cross structure, we can find the frequencies of the six possible mitonuclear genotypes in the F2 zygote pool by multiplying the probabilities:\n- $P(m_{A}, n_{A}n_{A}) = P(m_{A}) \\times P(n_{A}n_{A}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n- $P(m_{A}, n_{A}n_{B}) = P(m_{A}) \\times P(n_{A}n_{B}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n- $P(m_{A}, n_{B}n_{B}) = P(m_{A}) \\times P(n_{B}n_{B}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n- $P(m_{B}, n_{A}n_{A}) = P(m_{B}) \\times P(n_{A}n_{A}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n- $P(m_{B}, n_{A}n_{B}) = P(m_{B}) \\times P(n_{A}n_{B}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n- $P(m_{B}, n_{B}n_{B}) = P(m_{B}) \\times P(n_{B}n_{B}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{8}$.\nThe sum of these frequencies is $\\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} = 1$, as expected.\n\n**3.

The cell requires a total of $N$ protein molecules per cell cycle, aggregated over all organelles. If the gene remains in the organelle, there is no protein import cost, but the gene experiences a higher deleterious mutation rate; if the gene is transferred to the nucleus, the deleterious mutation rate drops substantially, but each synthesized protein must be imported into the organelle at an energetic cost.\n\nUse the following well-tested bases to construct a costâ€“benefit criterion:\n- Central Dogma of Molecular Biology: genes encode proteins; relocating a gene changes the site of transcription and translation but preserves protein function requirement.\n- Haldaneâ€“Muller principle for mutation load under multiplicative fitness and strong selection against loss-of-function: the per-locus mutation load is approximately equal to the per-locus deleterious mutation rate.\n- Small-cost approximation for bioenergetic expenditures: an energetic cost that consumes a fraction of the total Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) budget per cell cycle reduces relative fitness by approximately that fraction.\n\nAssume the following parameters are biologically realistic for a single protein-coding gene:\n- Gene length $L = 1500$ base pairs.\n- Fraction of base substitutions that cause effective loss-of-function $f_{d} = 0.25$.\n- Per-base deleterious mutation rate in the organelle $\\mu_{o} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-7}$ per base per cell cycle.\n- Per-base deleterious mutation rate in the nucleus $\\mu_{n} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}$ per base per cell cycle.\n- Total number of protein molecules required per cell cycle $N = 2000$.\n- Total ATP hydrolyses available to the cell per cell cycle $E_{\\text{tot}} = 1.5 \\times 10^{12}$.\n\nLet $\\varepsilon$ denote the ATP hydrolyses needed to import a single protein molecule into the organelle.

It is therefore deemed valid. The task is to establish a criterion for when natural selection favors the transfer of an essential organelle gene to the nucleus and to calculate the maximum permissible energetic cost of protein import for this transfer to be advantageous.\n\nThe evolutionary decision rests on a comparison of the total fitness costs associated with two states: the gene residing in the organelle versus the gene residing in the nucleus. Selection will favor the state with the lower total fitness cost. The total fitness cost, $C$, is the sum of the cost from deleterious mutations (mutation load) and the bioenergetic cost of protein synthesis and transport.\n\nLet us model the fitness cost for each scenario based on the provided principles.\n\n**Case 1: Gene remains in the organelle.**\nThe fitness cost in this scenario, $C_o$, has two components.\nFirst, the bioenergetic cost of protein import is stated to be zero, as the protein is synthesized within the organelle where it functions.\nSecond, the fitness cost from mutation load, $\\Delta W_{mut,o}$, is given by the Haldane-Muller principle as being approximately equal to the per-locus deleterious mutation rate, $U_{d,o}$. The per-locus deleterious mutation rate is the product of the gene length, $L$, the per-base mutation rate in the organelle, $\\mu_o$, and the fraction of mutations that are effectively deleterious, $f_d$.\n$$U_{d,o} = L f_d \\mu_o$$\nTherefore, the total fitness cost for the organelle-resident gene is:\n$$C_o = \\Delta W_{mut,o} = L f_d \\mu_o$$\n\n**Case 2: Gene is transferred to the nucleus.**\nThe fitness cost in this scenario, $C_n$, also has two components.\nFirst, the fitness cost from mutation load, $\\Delta W_{mut,n}$, is calculated similarly, but using the nuclear per-base mutation rate, $\\mu_n$.\n$$U_{d,n} = L f_d \\mu_n$$\nSo, the mutation load component of the cost is $\\Delta W_{mut,n} = L f_d \\mu_n$.\nSecond, there is a bioenergetic cost for importing each of the $N$ protein molecules from their site of synthesis in the cytoplasm into the organelle. If the cost to import a single protein is $\\varepsilon$ ATP hydrolyses, the total energy expenditure for import is $N\\varepsilon$. According to the small-cost approximation principle, this energetic expenditure reduces relative fitness by a fraction equal to the ratio of this cost to the total ATP budget of the cell, $E_{\\text{tot}}$.\n$$\\Delta W_{eng,n} = \\frac{N \\varepsilon}{E_{\\text{tot}}}$$\nThe total fitness cost for the nucleus-resident gene is the sum of the mutation load cost and the energetic cost:\n$$C_n = \\Delta W_{mut,n} + \\Delta W_{eng,n} = L f_d \\mu_n + \\frac{N \\varepsilon}{E_{\\text{tot}}}$$\n\n**Cost-Benefit Criterion**\nSelection favors the transfer of the gene to the nucleus if the total fitness cost of the nuclear-resident state is less than the total fitness cost of the organelle-resident state.\n$$C_n < C_o$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above, we obtain the cost-benefit inequality:\n$$L f_d \\mu_n + \\frac{N \\varepsilon}{E_{\\text{tot}}} < L f_d \\mu_o$$\nThis inequality specifies the condition under which gene transfer is favored.\n\n**Calculation of the Maximum Import Cost, $\\varepsilon_{\\max}$**\nTo find the maximum import cost per protein, $\\varepsilon_{\\max}$, for which the transfer is still favored, we solve the inequality for $\\varepsilon$.\n$$\\frac{N \\varepsilon}{E_{\\text{tot}}} < L f_d \\mu_o - L f_d \\mu_n$$\n$$\\frac{N \\varepsilon}{E_{\\text{tot}}} < L f_d (\\mu_o - \\mu_n)$$\n$$\\varepsilon < \\frac{E_{\\text{tot}} L f_d (\\mu_o - \\mu_n)}{N}$$\nThe maximum value, $\\varepsilon_{\\max}$, occurs at the boundary where the two costs are equal.
