The premises—using normalized read depth to infer copy number, partitioning a gene into windows, and applying a statistical test against a reference set of single-copy genes—are fundamental to the field. The provided data are internally consistent and numerically plausible. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. No violations of scientific principles, logical inconsistencies, or ambiguities are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe objective is to compute a $z$-score to test whether the observed read coverage for a candidate gene deviates significantly from the expectation for a single-copy locus in a diploid organism. The null hypothesis, $H_0$, is that the candidate gene is present in two copies (one per haploid genome), consistent with the reference single-copy loci.\n\nFirst, we compute the average per-base coverage for the candidate gene, $\\bar{C}_{\\text{gene}}$, by taking the arithmetic mean of the coverage values from its $m=8$ windows.\n$$\n\\bar{C}_{\\text{gene}} = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} C_i\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\bar{C}_{\\text{gene}} = \\frac{39 + 41 + 42 + 40 + 38 + 43 + 41 + 40}{8} = \\frac{324}{8} = 40.5\n$$\n\nNext, we normalize this observed mean coverage by the reference baseline coverage, $\\mu_{\\text{ref}} = 28.0$. This reference value represents the expected coverage for a diploid, single-copy region. The resulting value, which we denote $\\bar{x}_{\\text{norm}}$, is the sample mean for our statistical test.\n$$\n\\bar{x}_{\\text{norm}} = \\frac{\\bar{C}_{\\text{gene}}}{\\mu_{\\text{ref}}} = \\frac{40.5}{28.0}\n$$\nThis quantity, the normalized coverage, represents the observed copy number relative to the single-copy diploid state. To estimate the absolute copy number, one would multiply by $2$, yielding an estimate of $2 \\times \\frac{40.5}{28.0} \\approx 2.89$, suggesting a copy number gain.\n\nUnder the null hypothesis $H_0$, the true mean of the normalized coverage for any single-copy gene is expected to be $1$. We denote this expected mean under $H_0$ as $\\mu_0 = 1.0$.\n\nWe will now perform a $z$-test. The $z$-score for a sample mean is given by the formula:\n$$\nz = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{\\text{SE}}\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{x}$ is the sample mean, $\\mu_0$ is the population mean under the null hypothesis, and $\\text{SE}$ is the standard error of the mean.\n\nIn this context:\n-   The sample mean is the normalized average coverage of the candidate gene, $\\bar{x} = \\bar{x}_{\\text{norm}} = \\frac{40.5}{28.0}$.\n-   The population mean under $H_0$ is $\\mu_0 = 1.0$.\n-   The standard error of the mean is calculated as $\\text{SE} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$, where $\\sigma$ is the population standard deviation of the individual measurements and $n$ is the sample size. The problem provides the standard deviation of normalized window coverage as $\\sigma_{\\text{ref}} = 0.20$. The sample size is the number of windows, $m=8$. Thus, the standard error is:\n$$\n\\text{SE} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{ref}}}{\\sqrt{m}} = \\frac{0.20}{\\sqrt{8}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting these components into the $z$-score formula:\n$$\nz = \\frac{\\bar{x}_{\\text{norm}} - \\mu_0}{\\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{ref}}}{\\sqrt{m}}} = \\frac{\\frac{40.5}{28.0} - 1.0}{\\frac{0.20}{\\sqrt{8}}}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value.\n$$\nz = \\frac{\\frac{40.5 - 28.0}{28.0}}{\\frac{0.20}{\\sqrt{8}}} = \\frac{\\frac{12.5}{28.0}}{\\frac{0.20}{\\sqrt{8}}}\n$$\n$$\nz = \\frac{12.5}{28.0} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{8}}{0.20}\n$$\nSince $\\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$:\n$$\nz = \\frac{12.5}{28.0 \\times 0.20} \\times 2\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{12.5}{5.6} \\times 2\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{25\\sqrt{2}}{5.6}\n$$\nCalculating this value:\n$$\nz \\approx 6.31346...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

The matrix is block-diagonal, simplifying its inversion.\n$$V^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\left(\\begin{smallmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{smallmatrix}\\right)^{-1} & \\boldsymbol{0} \\\\ \\boldsymbol{0}^T & 2^{-1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\begin{smallmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{smallmatrix}\\right) & \\boldsymbol{0} \\\\ \\boldsymbol{0}^T & \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{3} & -\\frac{1}{3} & 0 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{2}{3} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe phylogenetically corrected correlation coefficient is calculated from the phylogenetically corrected sums of squares and cross-products. First, we compute the phylogenetic means, $\\bar{X}_{phy}$ and $\\bar{Y}_{phy}$, for the traits. Let $\\mathbf{1}$ be a column vector of ones of length $n=3$.\n$$\\bar{X}_{phy} = \\frac{\\mathbf{1}^T V^{-1} X}{\\mathbf{1}^T V^{-1} \\mathbf{1}}, \\quad \\bar{Y}_{phy} = \\frac{\\mathbf{1}^T V^{-1} Y}{\\mathbf{1}^T V^{-1} \\mathbf{1}}$$\nWe calculate the denominator term, $\\mathbf{1}^T V^{-1} \\mathbf{1}$:\n$$\\mathbf{1}^T V^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{3} & -\\frac{1}{3} & 0 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{2}{3} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$\\mathbf{1}^T V^{-1} \\mathbf{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{6}$$\nNext, we calculate the numerators:\n$$\\mathbf{1}^T V^{-1} X = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{3}{3} + 0 = \\frac{4}{3}$$\n$$\\mathbf{1}^T V^{-1} Y = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 35 \\\\ 38 \\\\ 33 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{35}{3} + \\frac{38}{3} + \\frac{33}{2} = \\frac{73}{3} + \\frac{33}{2} = \\frac{146+99}{6} = \\frac{245}{6}$$\nNow we find the phylogenetic means:\n$$\\bar{X}_{phy} = \\frac{4/3}{7/6} = \\frac{4}{3} \\cdot \\frac{6}{7} = \\frac{8}{7}$$\n$$\\bar{Y}_{phy} = \\frac{245/6}{7/6} = \\frac{245}{7} = 35$$\nWe center the data vectors using these means, defining $\\tilde{X} = X - \\bar{X}_{phy}\\mathbf{1}$ and $\\tilde{Y} = Y - \\bar{Y}_{phy}\\mathbf{1}$:\n$$\\tilde{X} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 - 8/7 \\\\ 3 - 8/7 \\\\ 0 - 8/7 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/7 \\\\ 13/7 \\\\ -8/7 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{7}\\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 13 \\\\ -8 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$\\tilde{Y} = \\begin{pmatrix} 35 - 35 \\\\ 38 - 35 \\\\ 33 - 35 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 3 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe phylogenetically corrected sum of squares ($SS$) and sum of cross-products ($SCP$) are given by:\n$$SS_X = \\tilde{X}^T V^{-1} \\tilde{X}, \\quad SS_Y = \\tilde{Y}^T V^{-1} \\tilde{Y}, \\quad SCP_{XY} = \\tilde{X}^T V^{-1} \\tilde{Y}$$\nCalculating these values:\n$$SS_X = \\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 13 \\\\ -8 \\end{pmatrix}\\right)^T \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{3} & -\\frac{1}{3} & 0 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{2}{3} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 13 \\\\ -8 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = \\frac{1}{49} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 13 & -8 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\\\ 9 \\\\ -4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{49}(5+117+32) = \\frac{154}{49} = \\frac{22}{7}$$\n$$SS_Y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 3 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}^T \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{3} & -\\frac{1}{3} & 0 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{2}{3} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 3 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 3 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = 0 + 6 + 2 = 8$$\n$$SCP_{XY} = \\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 13 \\\\ -8 \\end{pmatrix}\\right)^T \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{3} & -\\frac{1}{3} & 0 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{2}{3} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 3 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{7} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 13 & -8 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{7}(1+26+8) = \\frac{35}{7} = 5$$\nFinally, the phylogenetically corrected correlation coefficient, $r$, is:\n$$r = \\frac{SCP_{XY}}{\\sqrt{SS_X \\cdot SS_Y}} = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{\\frac{22}{7} \\cdot 8}} = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{\\frac{176}{7}}} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{\\sqrt{176}}$$\nTo simplify the denominator, we note that $176 = 16 \\times 11$, so $\\sqrt{176} = 4\\sqrt{11}$.\n$$r = \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{4\\sqrt{11}}$$\nRationalizing the denominator gives the final analytical expression:\n$$r = \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{4\\sqrt{11}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{11}}{\\sqrt{11}} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{77}}{44}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{5\\sqrt{77}}{44}}$$", "id": "2556728"}]}
