The concept of an evolutionary trade-off between transmission rate and parasite fecundity is a central tenet of modern evolutionary parasitology. The use of the basic reproduction number, $R_{0}$, as the measure of fitness to be optimized by natural selection under conditions of rare mutation and weak selection is standard methodology in mathematical epidemiology and evolutionary ecology. The specific functional forms—a saturating Michaelis-Menten-like function for the benefit and an exponential decay function for the cost—are standard, plausible representations for such biological processes.

The language is precise and objective. The problem statement contains no scientific or logical contradictions, no missing information, and no ill-posed elements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will now be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\n**Part 1: Formulation of the Objective Function $R_{0}(m)$**\nThe basic reproduction number, $R_{0}$, is defined as the expected number of secondary infections produced by a single infected individual in a completely susceptible population. For a trophically transmitted parasite, this value is proportional to the product of two key quantities that depend on the manipulation intensity $m$:\n1.  The total number of viable infective stages (propagules) produced by the parasite within its intermediate host.\n2.  The rate of successful transmission of these propagules to the definitive host, which is contingent on predation.\n\nLet $C$ be a positive constant aggregating all factors independent of $m$. These include host population densities, mortality rates not induced by manipulation, and infectivity of propagules in the definitive host, among others.\n\nThe total viable propagule output, by premise, is subject to a metabolic cost. If the baseline output is some constant, this output is modulated by the multiplicative penalty $\\exp(-\\gamma m)$.\nThe transmission rate is explicitly given as $\\beta(m) = \\beta_0(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha m))$.\n\nTherefore, the basic reproduction number as a function of manipulation intensity $m$ can be expressed as the product of these components:\n$$\nR_{0}(m) \\propto \\underbrace{\\left(\\exp(-\\gamma m)\\right)}_{\\text{Propagule Output Penalty}} \\times \\underbrace{\\left(\\beta_0(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha m))\\right)}_{\\text{Transmission Rate}}\n$$\nLet $K$ be a positive constant encompassing $\\beta_0$ and all other factors independent of $m$. The objective function to be maximized is thus proportional to:\n$$\nf(m) = \\exp(-\\gamma m) \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha m)\\right)\n$$\nExpanding this expression gives:\n$$\nf(m) = \\exp(-\\gamma m) - \\exp(-(\\alpha + \\gamma)m)\n$$\nThe problem reduces to finding the value of $m \\geq 0$ that maximizes this function $f(m)$, which is directly proportional to $R_{0}(m)$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Optimal Manipulation Intensity $m^{\\ast}$**\nTo find the optimal manipulation intensity $m^{\\ast}$, we must find the critical points of $f(m)$ by computing its first derivative with respect to $m$ and setting it to zero.\nThe derivative of $f(m)$ with respect to $m$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dm} = \\frac{d}{dm} \\left[ \\exp(-\\gamma m) - \\exp(-(\\alpha + \\gamma)m) \\right]\n$$\nUsing the chain rule for differentiation:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dm} = -\\gamma \\exp(-\\gamma m) - (-(\\alpha + \\gamma)) \\exp(-(\\alpha + \\gamma)m)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dm} = (\\alpha + \\gamma) \\exp(-(\\alpha + \\gamma)m) - \\gamma \\exp(-\\gamma m)\n$$\nTo find the critical point, we set the derivative equal to zero:\n$$\n(\\alpha + \\gamma) \\exp(-(\\alpha + \\gamma)m^{\\ast}) - \\gamma \\exp(-\\gamma m^{\\ast}) = 0\n$$\nAssuming a non-trivial solution where $m^{\\ast}$ is finite, we can rearrange the equation:\n$$\n(\\alpha + \\gamma) \\exp(-(\\alpha + \\gamma)m^{\\ast}) = \\gamma \\exp(-\\gamma m^{\\ast})\n$$\nTo solve for $m^{\\ast}$, we isolate the exponential terms:\n$$\n\\frac{\\exp(-(\\alpha + \\gamma)m^{\\ast})}{\\exp(-\\gamma m^{\\ast})} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\alpha + \\gamma}\n$$\nUsing the property of exponents, $\\exp(a)/\\exp(b) = \\exp(a-b)$:\n$$\n\\exp(-(\\alpha + \\gamma)m^{\\ast} + \\gamma m^{\\ast}) = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\alpha + \\gamma}\n$$\n$$\n\\exp(-\\alpha m^{\\ast}) = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\alpha + \\gamma}\n$$\nWe now take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for $m^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\exp(-\\alpha m^{\\ast})\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\alpha + \\gamma}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n-\\alpha m^{\\ast} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\alpha + \\gamma}\\right)\n$$\nMultiplying by $-1/\\alpha$:\n$$\nm^{\\ast} = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\alpha + \\gamma}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the logarithmic property $-\\ln(x/y) = \\ln(y/x)$, we arrive at the final expression for the evolutionarily optimal manipulation intensity:\n$$\nm^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\alpha + \\gamma}{\\gamma}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem statement assumes an interior optimum exists. We can verify that our result $m^{\\ast} > 0$. Since $\\alpha > 0$ and $\\gamma > 0$, the sum $\\alpha + \\gamma > \\gamma$. Therefore, the argument of the logarithm, $(\\alpha + \\gamma)/\\gamma$, is greater than $1$. The natural logarithm of any number greater than $1$ is positive. Thus, $m^{\\ast}$ is indeed positive, consistent with an interior optimum.

An ESS is a strategy that, if adopted by a population, cannot be invaded by any alternative (mutant) strategy. We will find this strategy using the principles of neighbor-modulated fitness, which is a formulation of inclusive fitness theory. This framework determines the optimal strategy by maximizing an individual's fitness, accounting for the effects of its behavior on the fitness of its relatives.\n\nThe fitness of a focal individual, genotype $i$, is given by:\n$$ w_i = B(M) - C(m_i) = a \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\beta M)\\right) - \\frac{c}{2} m_i^2 $$\nwhere $M = m_i + \\sum_{j \\neq i} m_j$.\n\nThe ESS condition is found by applying Hamilton's rule. We consider the marginal fitness effect of a small change in the focal individual's strategy, $m_i$. The change in a gene's frequency is proportional to the sum of the fitness effects of the behavior on all individuals in the group (including the actor), with each effect weighted by the actor's relatedness to the recipient. The ESS condition, $m^{\\ast}$, is the strategy where this marginal inclusive fitness effect is zero.\n\nThe condition is given by:\n$$ \\left. \\frac{\\partial w_i}{\\partial m_i} \\right|_{m_j = m^{\\ast}} + \\sum_{k \\neq i} r \\left. \\frac{\\partial w_k}{\\partial m_i} \\right|_{m_j = m^{\\ast}} = 0 $$\nThe first term is the effect of a change in strategy $m_i$ on the actor's own fitness. The second term is the sum of effects on the fitness of the $n-1$ social partners, each weighted by the pairwise relatedness $r$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the partial derivative of the focal individual's ($i$'s) fitness with respect to its own strategy $m_i$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial w_i}{\\partial m_i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial m_i} \\left[ B(M) - C(m_i) \\right] = B'(M) \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial m_i} - C'(m_i) $$\nSince $M = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} m_j$, we have $\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial m_i} = 1$. The derivative of the cost function is $C'(m_i) = \\frac{d}{dm_i}\\left(\\frac{c}{2}m_i^2\\right) = c m_i$. So:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial w_i}{\\partial m_i} = B'(M) - c m_i $$\n\nNext, we calculate the partial derivative of a social partner's ($k$'s, where $k \\neq i$) fitness with respect to the focal individual's strategy $m_i$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial w_k}{\\partial m_i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial m_i} \\left[ B(M) - C(m_k) \\right] = B'(M) \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial m_i} - 0 = B'(M) $$\nThe cost to individual $k$, $C(m_k)$, does not depend on $m_i$, so its derivative is zero.\n\nSubstituting these derivatives into the ESS condition:\n$$ (B'(M) - c m_i) + \\sum_{k \\neq i} r B'(M) = 0 $$\n$$ (B'(M) - c m_i) + (n-1)r B'(M) = 0 $$\nWe evaluate this at the symmetric equilibrium where $m_i = m_j = m^{\\ast}$ for all $j=1, \\dots, n$. At this point, the total manipulation is $M = M^{\\ast} = n m^{\\ast}$. The equation becomes:\n$$ B'(n m^{\\ast}) - c m^{\\ast} + (n-1)r B'(n m^{\\ast}) = 0 $$\nRearranging the terms to solve for $m^{\\ast}$:\n$$ B'(n m^{\\ast}) [1 + r(n-1)] = c m^{\\ast} $$\nNow, we substitute the specific functional form for the benefit function, $B(M) = a(1 - \\exp(-\\beta M))$.
