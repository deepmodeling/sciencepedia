The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing all necessary information to determine a unique, meaningful solution for the equilibrium species richness. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. We proceed to the solution.\n\n(a) Derivation of the equilibrium richness $S^{\\ast}$.\nThe equilibrium condition is defined by $\\frac{dS}{dt} = 0$, which implies that the immigration rate must equal the extinction rate, $I(S^{\\ast}) = E(S^{\\ast})$. We substitute the given functional forms for these rates:\n$$\nI_{0}\\left(1 - \\frac{S^{\\ast}}{M}\\right) = e_{0} + e_{1} S^{\\ast}\n$$\nThis is a linear equation in the variable $S^{\\ast}$. To solve for $S^{\\ast}$, we first expand the left-hand side:\n$$\nI_{0} - \\frac{I_{0}}{M} S^{\\ast} = e_{0} + e_{1} S^{\\ast}\n$$\nNext, we rearrange the equation to gather all terms involving $S^{\\ast}$ on one side and constant terms on the other:\n$$\nI_{0} - e_{0} = \\frac{I_{0}}{M} S^{\\ast} + e_{1} S^{\\ast}\n$$\nWe factor out $S^{\\ast}$ from the right-hand side:\n$$\nI_{0} - e_{0} = S^{\\ast} \\left(\\frac{I_{0}}{M} + e_{1}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, we isolate $S^{\\ast}$ by dividing by the term in the parenthesis. It is necessary to ensure the divisor is non-zero. Since $I_{0}$, $M$, and $e_{1}$ are rates or pool sizes, they are non-negative. The given values confirm they are strictly positive, so the divisor is positive.\n$$\nS^{\\ast} = \\frac{I_{0} - e_{0}}{\\frac{I_{0}}{M} + e_{1}}\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $M$:\n$$\nS^{\\ast} = \\frac{M(I_{0} - e_{0})}{M\\left(\\frac{I_{0}}{M} + e_{1}\\right)} = \\frac{M(I_{0} - e_{0})}{I_{0} + Me_{1}}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the equilibrium species richness $S^{\\ast}$.\n\n(b) Evaluation of $S^{\\ast}$ for the given parameters.\nThe given parameter values are $I_{0}=30$, $M=200$, $e_{0}=1$, and $e_{1}=0.1$. We substitute these values into the derived expression for $S^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nS^{\\ast} = \\frac{200(30 - 1)}{30 + 200(0.1)}\n$$\nWe compute the numerator and the denominator:\n$$\nS^{\\ast} = \\frac{200(29)}{30 + 20} = \\frac{5800}{50}\n$$\nPerforming the final division yields the numerical value for the equilibrium richness:\n$$\nS^{\\ast} = 116\n$$\n\n(c) Re-evaluation of $S^{\\ast}$ with decreased $I_{0}$ and analysis of the change.\nThe initial maximum immigration rate is $I_{0}=30$. This rate decreases by $50\\%$. The new rate, which we denote $I'_{0}$, is:\n$$\nI'_{0} = I_{0} \\times (1 - 0.50) = 30 \\times 0.5 = 15\n$$\nThe other parameters remain fixed: $M=200$, $e_{0}=1$, and $e_{1}=0.1$. We use the formula for $S^{\\ast}$ with the new value $I'_{0}$:\n$$\nS^{\\ast}_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{M(I'_{0} - e_{0})}{I'_{0} + Me_{1}} = \\frac{200(15 - 1)}{15 + 200(0.1)}\n$$\nWe compute the numerator and denominator for the new value:\n$$\nS^{\\ast}_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{200(14)}{15 + 20} = \\frac{2800}{35}\n$$\nPerforming the division gives the new equilibrium richness:\n$$\nS^{\\ast}_{\\text{new}} = 80\n$$\nTo determine whether $S^{\\ast}$ increases or decreases as $I_{0}$ decreases, we analyze the dependence of $S^{\\ast}$ on $I_{0}$. We examine the derivative of $S^{\\ast}$ with respect to $I_{0}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dS^{\\ast}}{dI_{0}} = \\frac{d}{dI_{0}}\\left(\\frac{M(I_{0} - e_{0})}{I_{0} + Me_{1}}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the quotient rule for differentiation, $\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right) = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$, where $u = M(I_{0} - e_{0})$ and $v = I_{0} + Me_{1}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dS^{\\ast}}{dI_{0}} = \\frac{(M)(I_{0} + Me_{1}) - (M(I_{0} - e_{0}))(1)}{(I_{0} + Me_{1})^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dS^{\\ast}}{dI_{0}} = \\frac{MI_{0} + M^{2}e_{1} - MI_{0} + Me_{0}}{(I_{0} + Me_{1})^{2}} = \\frac{M(Me_{1} + e_{0})}{(I_{0} + Me_{1})^{2}}\n$$\nSince $M > 0$, $e_{0} \\ge 0$, and $e_{1} \\ge 0$, the numerator $M(Me_{1} + e_{0})$ is positive. The denominator is a square and is also positive. Thus, $\\frac{dS^{\\ast}}{dI_{0}} > 0$. This proves that $S^{\\ast}$ is a strictly increasing function of $I_{0}$. Therefore, a decrease in $I_{0}$ must cause a decrease in $S^{\\ast}$.

The problem must be solved by implementing a program that fits each candidate form to the data using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) under independent and identically distributed Gaussian residuals and then computing AIC from the maximized likelihood for each model. The functional forms to consider are: a power-law species–area relationship, a semi-logarithmic relationship that is linear in the logarithm of area, and a Michaelis–Menten saturating hyperbola.

The AIC provides a quantitative measure to balance model fit (as measured by the maximized likelihood) and model complexity (as measured by the number of free parameters).\n\nThe statistical framework is a nonlinear regression model. For a given dataset of species richness values $S_i$ observed on islands of area $A_i$ for $i=1, \\dots, n$, we model the observation as:\n$$S_i = m(A_i; \\theta) + \\epsilon_i$$\nwhere $m(A_i; \\theta)$ is the mean function representing the expected species richness, which depends on the area $A_i$ and a vector of parameters $\\theta$.

The MLE for the variance is then $\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{RSS(\\hat{\\theta})}{n}$.\n\nOnce the MLE parameters $\\hat{\\theta}$ are found, we compute the maximized value of the log-likelihood, $\\log \\hat{L} = \\log L(\\hat{\\theta}, \\hat{\\sigma}^2)$. The formula is given as:\n$$\\log \\hat{L} = -\\frac{n}{2}\\left(\\log(2\\pi) + 1 + \\log\\left(\\frac{RSS(\\hat{\\theta})}{n}\\right)\\right)$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of data points ($n=10$ for all datasets).\n\nFinally, the Akaike Information Criterion is calculated for each model:\n$$AIC = 2k - 2 \\log \\hat{L}$$\nHere, $k$ is the total number of estimated parameters. For all three candidate models, there are two parameters in the mean structure ($\\theta$) and one parameter for the variance ($\\sigma^2$), so $k=2+1=3$.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows: For each of the three datasets, we fit each of the three models ($M_0, M_1, M_2$). This involves using a numerical optimization algorithm to find the parameters $\\hat{\\theta}$ that minimize the $RSS$. From the minimum $RSS$, the $AIC$ for that model is calculated. After computing the three $AIC$ values (one for each model), we select the model with the minimum $AIC$ as the most parsimonious choice for that dataset. The corresponding model identifier ($0, 1,$ or $2$) is recorded. This process is repeated for all three datasets.\n\nThe implementation will utilize the `scipy.optimize.minimize` function to perform the numerical minimization of $RSS$. Initial parameter estimates are crucial for convergence; these can be derived from the properties of the functions or by analyzing the data, for example, by considering linearized forms of the models. Constraints on parameters (e.g., positivity) are handled directly by the optimizer.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the model selection problem for the species-area relationship.\n\n    For each of three datasets, this function fits three candidate models\n    (power-law, semi-log, Michaelis-Menten) to species-area data.\n    The fitting is done by minimizing the sum of squared residuals (RSS) to find\n    the maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters under a Gaussian\n    error assumption.\n\n    The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is then calculated for each fitted model.\n    The model with the lowest AIC is selected as the most parsimonious, and its\n    identifier (0, 1, or 2) is recorded.\n\n    The final output is a list of the selected model identifiers for the three datasets.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the three candidate model functions\n    def power_law(params, A):\n        c, z = params\n        return c * (A ** z)\n\n    def semi_log(params, A):\n        c, z = params\n        return c + z * np.log(A)\n\n    def michaelis_menten(params, A):\n        alpha, beta = params\n        return (alpha * A) / (beta + A)\n\n    models = [\n        {'func': power_law, 'id': 0, 'k_mean': 2, 'bounds': ((1e-9, None), (None, None))},\n        {'func': semi_log, 'id': 1, 'k_mean': 2, 'bounds': ((None, None), (None, None))},\n        {'func': michaelis_menten, 'id': 2, 'k_mean': 2, 'bounds': ((1e-9, None), (1e-9, None))}\n    ]\n\n    # Test suite data\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"A\": np.array([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512]),\n            \"S\": np.array([10.3, 12.21, 15.36, 18.27, 23.08, 28.13, 35.43, 42.73, 53.22, 65.12]),\n            \"p0\": [(10, 0.3), (10, 9), (65, 50)]\n        },\n        {\n            \"A\": np.array([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512]),\n            \"S\": np.array([5.1, 10.345, 16.29, 21.535, 27.18, 32.825, 38.17, 44.015, 49.16, 55.005]),\n            \"p0\": [(5, 0.4), (5, 8), (55, 16)]\n        },\n        {\n            \"A\": np.array([1, 3, 10, 30, 50, 80, 120, 200, 400, 800]),\n            \"S\": np.array([2.4029, 6.672, 20.2, 44.7, 60.1, 73.696, 84.956, 95.8, 106.817, 112.841]),\n            \"p0\": [(2.4, 0.6), (2.4, 16.5), (115, 45)]\n        }\n    ]\n\n    def fit_and_get_aic(model_func, bounds, p0, A, S, k_mean):\n        \"\"\"\n        Fits a model to data and computes its AIC.\n        \"\"\"\n        n = len(A)\n        k_total = k_mean + 1  # Mean parameters + 1 for variance\n\n        def objective_func(params, A_data, S_data):\n            S_pred = model_func(params, A_data)\n            return np.sum((S_data - S_pred)**2)\n\n        opt_result = minimize(\n            objective_func,\n            p0,\n            args=(A, S),\n            method='L-BFGS-B',\n            bounds=bounds\n        )\n\n        min_rss = opt_result.fun\n        \n        # Check against division by zero if RSS is extremely small\n        if min_rss <= 0:\n            return np.inf\n\n        # Maximized log-likelihood for Gaussian residuals\n        log_likelihood_hat = -n / 2.0 * (np.log(2.0 * np.pi) + 1.0 + np.log(min_rss / n))\n        \n        # Akaike Information Criterion\n        aic = 2 * k_total - 2 * log_likelihood_hat\n        \n        return aic\n\n    results = []\n    for i, case in enumerate(test_cases):\n        A_data, S_data = case[\"A\"], case[\"S\"]\n        p0_list = case[\"p0\"]\n        aic_values = []\n        \n        for j, model in enumerate(models):\n            aic = fit_and_get_aic(\n                model_func=model['func'],\n                bounds=model['bounds'],\n                p0=p0_list[j],\n                A=A_data,\n                S=S_data,\n                k_mean=model['k_mean']\n            )\n            aic_values.append(aic)\n            \n        # Select model with the minimum AIC.\n        # np.argmin handles ties by returning the first occurrence.\n        best_model_id = np.argmin(aic_values)\n        results.append(best_model_id)\n\n    # Print the final result in the specified format\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2583890"}]}
