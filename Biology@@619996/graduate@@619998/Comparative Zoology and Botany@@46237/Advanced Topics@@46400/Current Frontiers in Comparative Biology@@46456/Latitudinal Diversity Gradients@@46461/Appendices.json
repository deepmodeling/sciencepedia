Sample coverage is defined as the proportion of the community’s total individual probability mass that is assigned to species already observed in the sample. Starting from the definition that coverage equals one minus the probability that the next sampled individual belongs to a species not yet observed, and assuming independent and identically distributed draws from a large community with fixed species relative abundances, derive a first-order estimator of sample coverage in terms of $f_{1}$ and $n$ based on the probability mass of unseen species, and then apply it to the following data:\n- Tropical site: $n_{\\mathrm{trop}} = 3600$, $f_{1,\\mathrm{trop}} = 720$.\n- Temperate site: $n_{\\mathrm{temp}} = 1800$, $f_{1,\\mathrm{temp}} = 90$.\n\nCompute the difference $\\Delta C = C_{\\mathrm{trop}} - C_{\\mathrm{temp}}$ using your derived estimator.
