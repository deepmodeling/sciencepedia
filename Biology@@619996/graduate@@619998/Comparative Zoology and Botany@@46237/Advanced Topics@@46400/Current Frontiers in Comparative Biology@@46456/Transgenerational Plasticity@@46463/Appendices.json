This first practice challenges you to interpret the parameters of a linear reaction norm model, a fundamental tool for partitioning phenotypic variance.

Assume negligible genetic variation within each study organism due to clonal propagation, so observed phenotypic variation across treatments arises from environmental effects within and across generations. The environments $E$ and $P$ are scaled and centered such that $E=0$ and $P=0$ correspond to the mean environmental conditions in the study, and $E$ and $P$ are measured on commensurate, standardized units.

This option states: $a$ is the baseline at $E=0$, $P=0$; $b$ is within-generation plasticity (change in $z$ per unit $E$ at $P=0$); $c$ is the parental main effect (change in $z$ per unit $P$ at $E=0$); $d$ is the cross-generational interaction that changes the within-generation slope with $P$ (or the parental effect with $E$), capturing environment-dependent transgenerational plasticity.

Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. This option incorrectly places the baseline at $E=1$, $P=1$ rather than $E=0$, $P=0$, which contradicts the centering. It also swaps the roles of $b$ and $c$ by labeling $b$ as transgenerational and $c$ as within-generation effects, misaligned with $b$ multiplying $E$ and $c$ multiplying $P$. Finally, it interprets $d$ as genetic-by-environment interaction, which is inappropriate here because there is no variation in genotype within the clonal design; $d$ is an environmental interaction between $E$ and $P$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. This option claims $b$ and $c$ are curvatures and $d$ captures nonlinearity. However, $b$ and $c$ are first derivatives (slopes), and the model contains no squared terms such as $E^2$ or $P^2$; the only interaction term $EP$ represents a first mixed partial derivative, not curvature within a single variable. Thus, the characterizations of curvature are incorrect. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. This option labels $a$ as the phenotype in the “most benign environment,” which is not necessarily true; $a$ is the phenotype at $E=0$, $P=0$ (the mean-centered reference), not a maximal or benign condition. It further describes $b$ as how parental environment modifies the phenotype regardless of $E$, which conflicts with $b$ multiplying $E$ (an offspring environment effect), and it calls $d$ an additive maternal effect independent of environment, which contradicts $d$ being the coefficient of $EP$, explicitly environment-dependent.

In the Gaussian linear model $\\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}+\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ with $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0},\\sigma^2\\mathbf{I})$, the Gauss–Markov theorem states that the Generalized Least Squares (GLS) estimator is the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) of $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ when the covariance of $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ is known up to parameters.

For Gaussian models, Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) maximizes the likelihood of linear combinations of $\\mathbf{y}$ that eliminate $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, producing variance component estimators with reduced finite-sample bias compared to full Maximum Likelihood (ML), especially when the number of levels of random effects is modest.

We identify $f_k$ as a random effect because families are a sample from a wider population of possible families within each species, and we aim to quantify among-family variance $\\sigma_f^2$ rather than estimate a separate parameter for each sampled family. The residual $\\epsilon_{ijk}$ captures within-family individual variation.

The among-family variance $\\sigma_f^2$ quantifies heterogeneity among families, inclusive of genetic and persistent parental contributions, which is essential for comparative inference across taxa.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. Claiming that ordinary least squares with cluster-robust standard errors suffices ignores that the within-family correlation structure affects both efficiency and, more importantly, the target of inference. Ordinary least squares estimates of fixed effects are unbiased under correct specification only if regressors are uncorrelated with the omitted random effect. However, the two-way factorial design by itself does not guarantee this in finite samples across families and taxa, and cluster-robust standard errors do not provide estimates of $\\sigma_f^2$ nor BLUPs of $f_k$, precluding variance partitioning central to transgenerational plasticity inference. Furthermore, cluster-robust methods can perform poorly with a small number of families. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nB. This option matches the mixed-model framework: treat $E$, $P$, and $(E\\times P)$ as fixed; treat family as a mean-zero random effect; estimate variance components by REML to reduce finite-sample bias; use GLS for BLUE of fixed effects; use BLUP for family effects with shrinkage determined by $\\sigma_f^2$, $\\sigma^2$, and $n_k$; interpret $\\sigma_f^2$ as among-family variance; and test $(E\\times P)$ for transgenerational plasticity. This is consistent with the Gaussian mixed-model theory and yields interpretable quantities for comparative zoology and botany. Verdict: Correct.\n\nC. Full ML for variance components is known to have finite-sample bias, particularly downward bias in $\\sigma_f^2$, because it does not account for the loss of degrees of freedom from estimating $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$. The statement that ML “avoids bias in fixed effects” is misleading: given $\\mathbf{V}$, the GLS estimator of fixed effects is the same under ML or REML for variance components, but ML does not improve fixed-effect unbiasedness relative to REML. Predicting $f_k$ as raw deviations from the grand mean ignores shrinkage and the varying precision across families due to different $n_k$ and residual variance; it is not the BLUP and is suboptimal. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. Treating $f_k$ as fixed saturates the model with one parameter per family, eliminating partial pooling and preventing estimation of the population-level variance $\\sigma_f^2$ that is central for comparative inference. Moreover, fixed family effects restrict inference to the sampled families and do not, contrary to the claim, “guarantee” generalization to unsampled families; in fact, the opposite holds: random-effects modeling is the route to generalization beyond the sampled levels. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. Bayesian hierarchical modeling with proper priors is a valid alternative framework, but the claims are inaccurate: posterior means are generally not unbiased in finite samples, and they depend on the prior and on $n_k$. The posterior mean of $f_k$ is a shrinkage estimator akin to BLUP, not the raw family deviation, and it varies with $n_k$. Equivalence to ordinary least squares in large samples holds only under specific priors and models and does not negate the need to model the random effects structure. As stated, the option mischaracterizes Bayesian estimation.
