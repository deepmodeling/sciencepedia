This setting is intended to illustrate the same Darwinian mechanism of differential survival that also operates in animal populations. Consider a single locus with two alleles, $A$ and $a$, and three genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$. At the start of the season (zygote stage), the genotype frequencies in a large, closed population are $x_{AA} = 0.30$, $x_{Aa} = 0.50$, and $x_{aa} = 0.20$. Under high salinity, the relative viabilities (relative fitnesses) are $w_{AA} = 0.88$, $w_{Aa} = 0.96$, and $w_{aa} = 0.52$. Assume discrete, non-overlapping generations, viability selection only within the season, random mating after selection, and no mutation, migration, or genetic drift.\n\nUsing only fundamental principles—namely, that relative fitness scales survival in proportion to $w$ for each genotype, that post-selection genotype frequencies are proportional to pre-selection genotype frequencies multiplied by their relative fitness and normalized to sum to $1$, and that allele frequencies are obtained by counting alleles from genotype frequencies—compute the frequency of allele $A$ immediately after viability selection and before mating.\n\nExpress your final answer as a decimal and round to five significant figures.

All necessary data are provided, and the constraints are consistent.\n\nThe task is to compute the frequency of allele $A$ after one episode of viability selection. Let the initial frequencies of the genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ be denoted by $x_{AA}$, $x_{Aa}$, and $x_{aa}$, respectively. Let their relative viabilities (fitnesses) be $w_{AA}$, $w_{Aa}$, and $w_{aa}$.\n\nThe given values are:\nInitial genotype frequencies:\n$x_{AA} = 0.30$\n$x_{Aa} = 0.50$\n$x_{aa} = 0.20$\n\nRelative viabilities:\n$w_{AA} = 0.88$\n$w_{Aa} = 0.96$\n$w_{aa} = 0.52$\n\nThe principle of viability selection dictates that the frequencies of genotypes after selection are proportional to their initial frequencies multiplied by their respective relative fitness values. To find the new frequencies, we must first compute a normalization constant, which is the mean fitness of the population, $\\bar{w}$.\n\nThe mean fitness, $\\bar{w}$, is the weighted average of the fitnesses of the genotypes, where the weights are the initial genotype frequencies:\n$$\n\\bar{w} = x_{AA} w_{AA} + x_{Aa} w_{Aa} + x_{aa} w_{aa}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\bar{w} = (0.30)(0.88) + (0.50)(0.96) + (0.20)(0.52)\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{w} = 0.264 + 0.480 + 0.104 = 0.848\n$$\nThis value, $\\bar{w} = 0.848$, represents the average relative fitness of the population.\n\nAfter selection, the new frequency of each genotype, denoted by a prime (e.g., $x'_{AA}$), is its initial frequency multiplied by its fitness, all divided by the mean fitness $\\bar{w}$.\n$$\nx'_{AA} = \\frac{x_{AA} w_{AA}}{\\bar{w}}\n$$\n$$\nx'_{Aa} = \\frac{x_{Aa} w_{Aa}}{\\bar{w}}\n$$\n$$\nx'_{aa} = \\frac{x_{aa} w_{aa}}{\\bar{w}}\n$$\n\nThe frequency of allele $A$ after selection, which we denote as $p'$, is derived from these post-selection genotype frequencies. According to the rules of Mendelian genetics for a diploid organism, each individual with genotype $AA$ contributes only $A$ alleles to the gene pool, while each individual with genotype $Aa$ contributes $A$ alleles for one-half of its loci. Individuals with genotype $aa$ contribute no $A$ alleles.\n\nTherefore, the frequency of allele $A$ in the surviving population is the sum of the frequency of the $AA$ genotype and half the frequency of the $Aa$ genotype:\n$$\np' = x'_{AA} + \\frac{1}{2} x'_{Aa}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the post-selection genotype frequencies:\n$$\np' = \\frac{x_{AA} w_{AA}}{\\bar{w}} + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{x_{Aa} w_{Aa}}{\\bar{w}} \\right)\n$$\nThis can be combined into a single expression:\n$$\np' = \\frac{x_{AA} w_{AA} + \\frac{1}{2} x_{Aa} w_{Aa}}{\\bar{w}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into this expression.

This practice moves our analysis to the level of the observable phenotype, using the celebrated Breeder's Equation, $R = h^{2} S$, to connect heritable variation and selection to evolutionary response. The exercise further challenges us to consider how non-genetic factors, such as maternal effects, can influence the phenotypic trajectory of a population alongside genetic evolution [@problem_id:2564235].", "problem": "A wild annual plant exhibits variation in corolla tube length that affects pollinator visitation and thus maternal seed set, consistent with Charles Darwin’s theory that differential reproductive success associated with heritable trait differences drives evolutionary change by natural selection. In a field experiment, directional phenotypic selection favoring longer corollas is imposed by allowing only the top quantile of seed-producing mothers (ranked by corolla length) to contribute to the next generation. The phenotypic selection differential, defined as the difference between the mean phenotype of selected mothers and the pre-selection population mean, is measured as $S = 1.50$ millimeters (mm). A quantitative genetic analysis using a half-sibling design in the same population estimates the narrow-sense heritability as $h^{2} = 0.42$ for corolla length, assuming additivity and no genotype-by-environment interaction across the experimental setting.\n\n1) Using only fundamental definitions linking selection to evolutionary change, compute the expected genetic response to selection in the next generation, $R$, in millimeters, under the assumption of no maternal effects. Round your numerical answer to four significant figures and express the result in mm.\n\n2) Now consider a simple one-generation maternal effect model in which the offspring phenotype $z_{\\mathrm{offspring}}$ is influenced additively by the offspring’s breeding value and by a non-genetic carryover from the maternal phenotype: $z_{\\mathrm{offspring}} = a_{\\mathrm{offspring}} + m \\, z_{\\mathrm{mother}} + e$, where $m \\in [0,1)$ is the maternal effect coefficient (the partial regression of offspring phenotype on the maternal phenotype attributable to non-genetic provisioning) and $e$ is an environmental deviation with zero mean. Derive, in closed form, the symbolic expression for the realized shift in the offspring generation mean phenotype after a single episode of selection acting through maternal reproductive success, in terms of $h^{2}$, $S$, and $m$.\n\nAssume random mating after selection, a large population, no dominance or epistasis contributing to covariances with fitness, and that selection operates only through the measured phenotype in the generation of mothers.", "solution": "The problem presents two tasks grounded in the principles of evolutionary quantitative genetics. The first part requires the calculation of the genetic response to selection using the Breeder's Equation, given standard parameters. The second part requires the derivation of the total phenotypic response in a single generation when a non-genetic maternal effect is present. Both parts are well-posed and based on fundamental, scientifically established models.\n\nFor the first part, we are asked to compute the expected genetic response to selection, denoted by $R$. This quantity represents the change in the mean breeding value of the population from the parental generation to the offspring generation. Under the specified assumption of no maternal effects, the relationship between the response to selection ($R$), the narrow-sense heritability ($h^{2}$), and the phenotypic selection differential ($S$) is given by the Breeder's Equation:\n$$R = h^{2} S$$\nThe narrow-sense heritability, $h^{2}$, quantifies the proportion of the total phenotypic variance that is attributable to additive genetic variance, which is the basis for the resemblance between parents and offspring that allows for a response to selection. The selection differential, $S$, measures the strength of directional selection by quantifying the difference between the mean phenotype of the selected parents and the mean phenotype of the entire population before selection.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- The phenotypic selection differential, $S = 1.50$ mm.\n- The narrow-sense heritability, $h^{2} = 0.42$.\n\nSubstituting these given values into the Breeder's Equation, we calculate the expected genetic response:\n$$R = (0.42) \\times (1.50) \\, \\text{mm}$$\n$$R = 0.63 \\, \\text{mm}$$\nThe problem requires the numerical answer to be expressed with four significant figures. Thus, the result is $0.6300$ mm.\n\nFor the second part, we must derive a symbolic expression for the total realized shift in the offspring generation's mean phenotype, which we will denote as $\\Delta \\bar{z}$. This shift occurs under a model that includes a non-genetic maternal effect. The phenotype of an individual offspring, $z_{\\mathrm{offspring}}$, is given by the additive model:\n$$z_{\\mathrm{offspring}} = a_{\\mathrm{offspring}} + m \\, z_{\\mathrm{mother}} + e$$\nHere, $a_{\\mathrm{offspring}}$ is the offspring's breeding value, $z_{\\mathrm{mother}}$ is the mother's phenotype, $m$ is the maternal effect coefficient, and $e$ is an environmental deviation with an expected value of zero.\n\nThe total phenotypic shift, $\\Delta \\bar{z}$, is the difference between the mean phenotype of the offspring generation, $\\bar{z}_{\\mathrm{offspring}}$, and the mean phenotype of the parental generation before selection, $\\bar{z}_{\\mathrm{parental}}$. We can decompose this total shift into two causal components: (1) the heritable genetic change and (2) the non-heritable change due to the maternal environment.\n\n1.  The genetic component of the change is the response to selection, $R$, which is the change in the mean breeding value of the population. From standard theory and as used in the first part, this is given by $R = h^{2} S$. This component is directly inherited.\n\n2.  The maternal effect component arises from the term $m \\, z_{\\mathrm{mother}}$ in the phenotypic model. Selection acts on the mothers, so the mothers of the next generation are, on average, phenotypically different from the parental population average. The mean phenotype of the selected mothers is $\\bar{z}_{\\mathrm{selected}}$, while the mean of the parental population was $\\bar{z}_{\\mathrm{parental}}$. The selection differential is $S = \\bar{z}_{\\mathrm{selected}} - \\bar{z}_{\\mathrm{parental}}$. The average maternal environmental contribution to an offspring's phenotype is proportional to the mother's phenotype. Therefore, the change in the average phenotype due to the change in the maternal environment is the difference between the maternal effect provided by a selected mother and that provided by an average pre-selection mother:\n$$\\text{Change due to maternal effect} = m \\cdot \\bar{z}_{\\mathrm{selected}} - m \\cdot \\bar{z}_{\\mathrm{parental}}$$\nFactoring out $m$, we get:\n$$\\text{Change due to maternal effect} = m (\\bar{z}_{\\mathrm{selected}} - \\bar{z}_{\\mathrm{parental}}) = m S$$\nThis component is an environmental effect experienced by the offspring generation because their mothers were a selected, non-random sample of the parental generation.\n\nThe total realized shift in the mean phenotype of the offspring, $\\Delta \\bar{z}$, is the sum of the genetic component and the maternal effect component:\n$$\\Delta \\bar{z} = (\\text{Genetic Change}) + (\\text{Maternal Effect Change})$$\n$$\\Delta \\bar{z} = R + m S$$\nSubstituting the expression for $R$ from the Breeder's Equation:\n$$\\Delta \\bar{z} = h^{2} S + m S$$\nBy factoring out the selection differential $S$, we arrive at the final closed-form expression for the one-generation phenotypic shift:\n$$\\Delta \\bar{z} = (h^{2} + m) S$$\nThis expression demonstrates that the immediate phenotypic response to selection is inflated by the maternal effect, as the selected maternal phenotype directly influences the offspring phenotype in a non-genetic manner.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.6300 & (h^{2} + m)S \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2564235"}, {"introduction": "Organisms are integrated systems, not collections of independent traits.
