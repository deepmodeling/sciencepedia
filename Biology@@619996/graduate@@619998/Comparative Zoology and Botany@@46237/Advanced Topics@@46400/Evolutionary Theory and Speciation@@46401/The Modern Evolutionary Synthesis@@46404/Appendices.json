Real populations, however, are subject to various evolutionary forces and non-random mating systems that cause genotype frequencies to deviate from this baseline. This first practice problem provides a direct method for quantifying such a deviation by diagnosing a deficit of heterozygotes in a hypothetical population sample.

The population geneticist estimates allele frequencies as $p(A)=0.7$ and $q(a)=0.3$ from a large, random-mating sample, and the observed frequency of heterozygotes (observed heterozygosity) is $H_{O}=0.36$. Using the core definition of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), namely that under random mating and in the absence of evolutionary forces allele frequencies $p$ and $q$ determine genotype frequencies through random union of gametes, first determine the HWE-expected genotype frequencies for $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$. Then, starting from the definition of Wright’s inbreeding coefficient within subpopulations ($F_{IS}$), defined conceptually as the proportional reduction in heterozygosity relative to the HWE expectation due to non-random mating or related processes, derive an expression that links $F_{IS}$ to $H_O$ and the HWE-expected heterozygosity and use it to compute the degree of heterozygote deficit for this locus. Provide only the final value of $F_{IS}$ as a simplified fraction. No units are required.", "solution": "The problem statement presents a standard scenario in population genetics, which is valid and well-posed. We are provided with allele frequencies for a biallelic locus and the observed frequency of heterozygotes. Our task is to calculate the inbreeding coefficient, $F_{IS}$.\n\nLet the alleles be $A$ and $a$. The given frequencies of these alleles in the population are $p$ and $q$, respectively.\nThe provided values are:\n- Frequency of allele $A$: $p = 0.7$\n- Frequency of allele $a$: $q = 0.3$\nAs a basic check, we confirm that the sum of allele frequencies is $p + q = 0.7 + 0.3 = 1$. The system is self-consistent.\nThe observed frequency of heterozygotes ($Aa$) in the sample is given as $H_{O} = 0.36$.\n\nThe first step is to determine the genotype frequencies expected under Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). The principle of HWE posits that in a large, randomly mating population, free from the influence of evolutionary forces such as mutation, migration, and selection, the genotype frequencies at a locus are a simple function of the allele frequencies. Specifically, they are given by the terms of the binomial expansion of $(p+q)^2$.\n\nThe expected frequency of the homozygous genotype $AA$ is:\n$$ f(AA)_{exp} = p^2 = (0.7)^2 = 0.49 $$\nThe expected frequency of the heterozygous genotype $Aa$, also known as the expected heterozygosity ($H_E$), is:\n$$ H_E = f(Aa)_{exp} = 2pq = 2(0.7)(0.3) = 0.42 $$\nThe expected frequency of the homozygous genotype $aa$ is:\n$$ f(aa)_{exp} = q^2 = (0.3)^2 = 0.09 $$\nThe sum of these expected frequencies must be unity: $f(AA)_{exp} + f(Aa)_{exp} + f(aa)_{exp} = 0.49 + 0.42 + 0.09 = 1.00$. The calculation is correct.\n\nThe second step is to derive the expression for Wright’s inbreeding coefficient, $F_{IS}$, based on its definition. $F_{IS}$ measures the deviation of heterozygosity within a subpopulation from the HWE expectation. It is defined as the proportional reduction in heterozygosity observed ($H_O$) relative to the heterozygosity expected under HWE ($H_E$).\n\nThe absolute reduction in heterozygosity is the difference between the expected and observed values, which is $H_E - H_O$.\nTo express this as a proportion relative to the expected value, we divide this difference by $H_E$. This gives the formal definition:\n$$ F_{IS} = \\frac{H_E - H_O}{H_E} $$\nA positive value of $F_{IS}$ indicates a deficit of heterozygotes compared to HWE expectations, often due to inbreeding or other forms of non-random mating (e.g., population substructure, the Wahlund effect). A negative value would indicate an excess of heterozygotes.\n\nThe final step is to compute the value of $F_{IS}$ using the given and calculated quantities. We have:\n- Expected heterozygosity, $H_E = 0.42$.\n- Observed heterozygosity, $H_O = 0.36$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for $F_{IS}$:\n$$ F_{IS} = \\frac{0.42 - 0.36}{0.42} $$\n$$ F_{IS} = \\frac{0.06}{0.42} $$\nTo express this result as a simplified fraction, we can write the decimal values as fractions and simplify:\n$$ F_{IS} = \\frac{6/100}{42/100} = \\frac{6}{42} $$\nDividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $6$, yields:\n$$ F_{IS} = \\frac{1}{7} $$\nThis positive value confirms that there is a deficit of heterozygotes in the surveyed population relative to the expectation from random mating.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{7}}$$", "id": "2618070"}, {"introduction": "Genetic drift is a powerful evolutionary force, particularly in small populations, but the headcount of individuals—the census size ($N_c$)—is often a poor guide to a population's evolutionary dynamics.

The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing all necessary information for the derivation. The numerical values provided are biologically plausible for the given species example (elephant seals). The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation proceeds by calculating the sampling variance of the allele frequency from one generation to the next and equating it to the corresponding variance in an idealized population of size $N_e$.\n\nLet $p_t$ be the frequency of a neutral allele at an autosomal locus in the entire population in generation $t$. The problem states that this frequency is equal in males and females. The parents of generation $t+1$ consist of a group of $N_m$ breeding males and a group of $N_f$ breeding females, which are drawn randomly from generation $t$.\n\nLet $p_m$ be the realized allele frequency within the sample of $N_m$ males and $p_f$ be the realized allele frequency within the sample of $N_f$ females. These males carry $2N_m$ alleles and the females carry $2N_f$ alleles. The process of drawing these parental groups is equivalent to binomial sampling from the gene pool of generation $t$.\n\nThe variance of the allele frequency in the sample of $N_m$ males, conditional on $p_t$, is the variance of a binomial proportion:\n$$ \\text{Var}(p_m | p_t) = \\frac{p_t(1-p_t)}{2N_m} $$\nSimilarly, the variance of the allele frequency in the sample of $N_f$ females is:\n$$ \\text{Var}(p_f | p_t) = \\frac{p_t(1-p_t)}{2N_f} $$\nThe problem states that the allele frequency in the next generation, $p_{t+1}$, is the average of the frequencies in the paternal and maternal gamete contributions. The frequency in the paternal gamete contribution (i.e., the gamete pool produced by the $N_m$ fathers) is $p_m$. The frequency in the maternal gamete contribution is $p_f$. Thus, the problem defines the transition as:\n$$ p_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{2} (p_m + p_f) $$\nThis definition simplifies the process by considering only the sampling of parents, not the subsequent sampling of gametes to form zygotes. We proceed based on this given definition.\n\nWe now compute the variance of $p_{t+1}$ conditional on $p_t$. Since the male and female parents are sampled independently from the population of generation $t$, the random variables $p_m$ and $p_f$ are independent.\n$$ \\text{Var}(p_{t+1} | p_t) = \\text{Var}\\left( \\frac{1}{2} (p_m + p_f) \\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 (\\text{Var}(p_m) + \\text{Var}(p_f)) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the variances of $p_m$ and $p_f$:\n$$ \\text{Var}(p_{t+1} | p_t) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{p_t(1-p_t)}{2N_m} + \\frac{p_t(1-p_t)}{2N_f} \\right) $$\n$$ \\text{Var}(p_{t+1} | p_t) = \\frac{p_t(1-p_t)}{8} \\left( \\frac{1}{N_m} + \\frac{1}{N_f} \\right) $$\nThis expression gives the one-generation sampling variance for the allele frequency in the specified dioecious population.\n\nBy definition, the inbreeding effective population size, $N_e$, is the size of an ideal Wright-Fisher population that would experience the same magnitude of genetic drift (i.e., the same sampling variance). In an ideal WF population of size $N_e$, the one-generation sampling variance is:\n$$ \\text{Var}(p') = \\frac{p(1-p)}{2N_e} $$\nEquating the two expressions for the variance allows us to solve for $N_e$:\n$$ \\frac{p_t(1-p_t)}{2N_e} = \\frac{p_t(1-p_t)}{8} \\left( \\frac{1}{N_m} + \\frac{1}{N_f} \\right) $$\nAssuming the allele is not fixed or lost (i.e., $0 < p_t < 1$), the term $p_t(1-p_t)$ cancels from both sides:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2N_e} = \\frac{1}{8} \\left( \\frac{1}{N_m} + \\frac{1}{N_f} \\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{N_e} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{N_m} + \\frac{1}{N_f} \\right) $$\nThis provides an expression for the reciprocal of $N_e$. To obtain a closed-form expression for $N_e$, we can rearrange the terms:\n$$ \\frac{1}{N_e} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{N_f + N_m}{N_m N_f} \\right) $$\n$$ N_e = \\frac{4 N_m N_f}{N_m + N_f} $$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the inbreeding effective population size in terms of the number of breeding males and females.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $N_e$ for the given elephant seal colony, where $N_m = 20$ and $N_f = 200$.\n$$ N_e = \\frac{4 \\times 20 \\times 200}{20 + 200} $$\n$$ N_e = \\frac{16000}{220} $$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$ N_e = \\frac{1600}{22} = \\frac{800}{11} $$\nSince $11$ is a prime number and does not divide $800$, this fraction is in its simplest reduced form.

There are no \"Scientific or Factual Unsoundness,\" \"Incomplete or Contradictory Setup,\" or other invalidating flaws.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe solution proceeds from the fundamental definitions of the quantities in question, as required by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the slope of the mid-parent–offspring regression and narrow-sense heritability under the given assumptions. The narrow-sense heritability, $h^{2}$, is defined as the ratio of the additive genetic variance, $V_{A}$, to the total phenotypic variance, $V_{P}$:\n$$h^{2} = \\frac{V_{A}}{V_{P}}$$\nThe slope, $b$, of the regression of offspring phenotype ($P_{O}$) on the mid-parent phenotype ($\\bar{P}_{P}$) is given by the ratio of their covariance to the variance of the mid-parent phenotype:\n$$b = \\frac{\\mathrm{cov}(P_{O}, \\bar{P}_{P})}{\\mathrm{var}(\\bar{P}_{P})}$$\nThe phenotype is the sum of the additive genetic value ($A$) and the environmental deviation ($E$), so $P = A + E$. Under the problem's assumption that dominance, epistasis, and genotype-by-environment interactions are negligible, this simplification is exact. The mid-parent phenotype is $\\bar{P}_{P} = \\frac{P_{P1} + P_{P2}}{2}$, where $P_{P1}$ and $P_{P2}$ are the phenotypes of the two parents.\n\nThe covariance term is analyzed first:\n$$\\mathrm{cov}(P_{O}, \\bar{P}_{P}) = \\mathrm{cov}\\left(A_{O} + E_{O}, \\frac{A_{P1} + A_{P2}}{2} + \\frac{E_{P1} + E_{P2}}{2}\\right)$$\nDue to the assumption of no environmental correlation between parents and offspring (a consequence of the common-garden design and the \"no maternal or paternal environmental effects\" condition), the environmental terms do not covary with any other term. Thus:\n$$\\mathrm{cov}(P_{O}, \\bar{P}_{P}) = \\mathrm{cov}\\left(A_{O}, \\frac{A_{P1} + A_{P2}}{2}\\right)$$\nAn offspring's additive genetic value, $A_{O}$, is the average of its parents' additive genetic values plus a component due to Mendelian segregation. Specifically, $A_{O} = \\frac{1}{2}A_{P1} + \\frac{1}{2}A_{P2} + A_{segregation}$. The expected value of the segregation component is zero, and it is uncorrelated with the parental values. Therefore:\n$$\\mathrm{cov}(P_{O}, \\bar{P}_{P}) = \\mathrm{cov}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}A_{P1} + \\frac{1}{2}A_{P2}, \\frac{1}{2}(A_{P1} + A_{P2})\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\\mathrm{var}(A_{P1} + A_{P2})$$\nWith the assumption of random mating (no assortative mating), the additive genetic values of the parents are uncorrelated, so $\\mathrm{cov}(A_{P1}, A_{P2}) = 0$. The variance of the sum is the sum of the variances:\n$$\\mathrm{cov}(P_{O}, \\bar{P}_{P}) = \\frac{1}{4}(\\mathrm{var}(A_{P1}) + \\mathrm{var}(A_{P2})) = \\frac{1}{4}(V_{A} + V_{A}) = \\frac{1}{2}V_{A}$$\n\nNext, the variance of the mid-parent phenotype is determined:\n$$\\mathrm{var}(\\bar{P}_{P}) = \\mathrm{var}\\left(\\frac{P_{P1} + P_{P2}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\\mathrm{var}(P_{P1} + P_{P2})$$\nAgain, assuming no assortative mating, the phenotypes of the parents are uncorrelated, $\\mathrm{cov}(P_{P1}, P_{P2}) = 0$. Thus:\n$$\\mathrm{var}(\\bar{P}_{P}) = \\frac{1}{4}(\\mathrm{var}(P_{P1}) + \\mathrm{var}(P_{P2})) = \\frac{1}{4}(V_{P} + V_{P}) = \\frac{1}{2}V_{P}$$\n\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for the slope $b$:\n$$b = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}V_{A}}{\\frac{1}{2}V_{P}} = \\frac{V_{A}}{V_{P}}$$\nThis demonstrates that under the specified conditions, the slope of the mid-parent–offspring regression is a direct estimator of the narrow-sense heritability: $b = h^{2}$.\n\nWith these principles established, we can calculate the three required quantities.\n\n1.  **Narrow-sense heritability ($h^{2}$)**:\n    Given the regression slope $b = 0.4$, the narrow-sense heritability is:\n    $$h^{2} = b = 0.4$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, $h^{2} = 0.4000$.\n\n2.  **Additive genetic variance ($V_{A}$)**:\n    From the definition of heritability, we can rearrange to solve for $V_{A}$:\n    $$V_{A} = h^{2} V_{P}$$\n    Substituting the given value $V_{P} = 10$ and our calculated $h^{2} = 0.4$:\n    $$V_{A} = 0.4 \\times 10 = 4$$\n    The units are $\\mathrm{cm}^{4}$. Rounding to four significant figures gives $V_{A} = 4.000$.\n\n3.  **Response to selection ($R$)**:\n    The expected response to one generation of selection, $R$, is predicted by the breeder's equation:\n    $$R = h^{2} S$$\n    Using $h^{2} = 0.4$ and the given selection differential $S = 1.5$:\n    $$R = 0.4 \\times 1.5 = 0.6$$\n    The units are $\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$. Rounding to four significant figures gives $R = 0.6000$.\n\nThe three quantities are $V_{A} = 4.000$ $\\mathrm{cm}^{4}$, $h^{2} = 0.4000$, and $R = 0.6000$ $\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$.
