This practice problem tasks you with conducting a full bioenergetic audit for the oxidation of palmitate, a common saturated fatty acid.

In mammalian cells, activation of palmitate to palmitoyl–coenzyme A is catalyzed by a long-chain acyl–coenzyme A synthetase on the cytosolic face of the outer mitochondrial membrane and is coupled to the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate, with inorganic pyrophosphatase driving the pyrophosphate hydrolysis to two inorganic phosphates. The resulting acyl group is shuttled across the inner mitochondrial membrane via the carnitine shuttle, which consists of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I), the carnitine–acylcarnitine translocase (CACT), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT-II), regenerating the acyl–coenzyme A in the matrix. Assume the carnitine shuttle itself does not directly consume ATP.\n\nStarting from these biochemical facts and the definitions of one round of mitochondrial saturated even-chain fatty acid β-oxidation (each round shortens the acyl chain by two carbons, producing one acetyl–coenzyme A, one reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), and one reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide ($FADH_2$)), and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle outputs per acetyl–coenzyme A (three NADH, one $FADH_2$, and one guanosine triphosphate (GTP) that is energetically equivalent to one ATP), compute the adjusted ATP yield per palmitate molecule as follows:\n\n- First, determine the total ATP-equivalent cost to activate one molecule of palmitate to palmitoyl–coenzyme A, given that ATP is converted to AMP and pyrophosphate and that pyrophosphate is hydrolyzed to two inorganic phosphates.\n- Next, using widely accepted mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) coupling values of $2.5$ ATP generated per mitochondrial NADH and $1.5$ ATP per mitochondrial $FADH_2$, convert all reducing equivalents from complete oxidation of palmitate (β-oxidation plus the TCA cycle) to ATP and include substrate-level phosphorylation from GTP.\n- Finally, subtract the activation cost from the gross ATP yield to obtain the adjusted ATP per palmitate molecule.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single integer number of ATP molecules per palmitate molecule. No rounding instruction is needed because an exact integer is expected.", "solution": "The problem statement presented is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It provides a clear set of established biochemical facts and standard energy conversion values, allowing for a rigorous and unique solution. We shall proceed with the calculation.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the net adenosine triphosphate (ATP) yield from the complete oxidation of one molecule of palmitate. Palmitate is a saturated fatty acid with a $16$-carbon chain, with the chemical formula $C_{16}H_{32}O_2$. The calculation is performed in three principal stages: determination of the initial activation cost, calculation of the gross ATP yield from catabolism, and finally, computation of the net yield.\n\n**Step 1: Energy Cost of Fatty Acid Activation**\n\nThe activation of palmitate to its thioester derivative, palmitoyl–coenzyme A (palmitoyl-CoA), occurs in the cytosol on the outer mitochondrial membrane. The reaction is catalyzed by long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase and is coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and inorganic pyrophosphate ($PP_i$).\n\n$$\n\\text{Palmitate} + \\text{CoA} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{Palmitoyl-CoA} + \\text{AMP} + PP_i\n$$\n\nThe reaction is driven forward by the subsequent, essentially irreversible hydrolysis of pyrophosphate by inorganic pyrophosphatase.\n\n$$\nPP_i + H_2O \\rightarrow 2 P_i\n$$\n\nThe net effect is the cleavage of two high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds from one ATP molecule. To restore the adenine nucleotide pool, the cell must phosphorylate AMP back to ATP. This requires two phosphorylation steps. First, adenylate kinase catalyzes the conversion of AMP and ATP to two molecules of ADP.\n\n$$\n\\text{AMP} + \\text{ATP} \\leftrightarrow 2 \\text{ADP}\n$$\n\nSubsequently, both ADP molecules are phosphorylated to ATP by ATP synthase during oxidative phosphorylation. From an energetic accounting perspective, the conversion of AMP back to ATP consumes two ATP equivalents. Thus, the activation cost for one molecule of palmitate is $2$ ATP.\n\n**Step 2: Gross ATP Yield from β-Oxidation and the Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) Cycle**\n\nThe complete oxidation of palmitoyl-CoA involves two sequential processes: β-oxidation in the mitochondrial matrix, followed by the oxidation of the resulting acetyl-CoA molecules in the TCA cycle.\n\n**A. β-Oxidation of Palmitoyl-CoA**\nFor a saturated fatty acid with $n$ carbon atoms, the number of β-oxidation rounds required is $(n/2) - 1$, and the number of acetyl-CoA molecules produced is $n/2$. For palmitate, $n=16$.\n- Number of β-oxidation rounds = $(16/2) - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7$ rounds.\n- Number of acetyl-CoA molecules produced = $16/2 = 8$ molecules.\n\nEach round of β-oxidation produces one molecule of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and one molecule of reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide ($FADH_2$).\n- Total yield from $7$ rounds of β-oxidation:\n  - $7$ NADH\n  - $7$ $FADH_2$\n\n**B. TCA Cycle Oxidation of Acetyl-CoA**\nThe $8$ molecules of acetyl-CoA produced from β-oxidation enter the TCA cycle. Each turn of the TCA cycle, processing one molecule of acetyl-CoA, yields:\n- $3$ NADH\n- $1$ $FADH_2$\n- $1$ guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which is energetically equivalent to $1$ ATP.\n\nTherefore, the oxidation of $8$ acetyl-CoA molecules yields:\n- $8 \\times 3 = 24$ NADH\n- $8 \\times 1 = 8$ $FADH_2$\n- $8 \\times 1 = 8$ GTP (equivalent to $8$ ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation)\n\n**C. Total Gross ATP Yield from Catabolism**\nWe now sum the total reducing equivalents and substrate-level phosphorylation products from both β-oxidation and the TCA cycle.\n- Total NADH = $7$ (from β-oxidation) + $24$ (from TCA cycle) = $31$ NADH.\n- Total $FADH_2$ = $7$ (from β-oxidation) + $8$ (from TCA cycle) = $15$ $FADH_2$.\n- Total substrate-level phosphorylation = $8$ GTP = $8$ ATP.\n\nUsing the provided oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) coupling values:\n- $1$ NADH generates $2.5$ ATP.\n- $1$ $FADH_2$ generates $1.5$ ATP.\n\nThe total ATP generated via OXPHOS is:\n- ATP from NADH = $31 \\times 2.5 = 77.5$ ATP.\n- ATP from $FADH_2$ = $15 \\times 1.5 = 22.5$ ATP.\n\nThe gross ATP yield is the sum of ATP from OXPHOS and substrate-level phosphorylation:\n- Gross ATP Yield = ($77.5$ ATP from NADH) + ($22.5$ ATP from $FADH_2$) + ($8$ ATP from GTP)\n- Gross ATP Yield = $100 + 8 = 108$ ATP.\n\n**Step 3: Adjusted (Net) ATP Yield**\n\nThe final adjusted, or net, ATP yield is the gross yield minus the initial activation cost.\n- Activation Cost = $2$ ATP.\n- Gross Yield = $108$ ATP.\n\n- Net ATP Yield = Gross ATP Yield - Activation Cost\n- Net ATP Yield = $108 - 2 = 106$ ATP.\n\nThus, the complete oxidation of one molecule of palmitate yields a net total of $106$ molecules of ATP.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{106}\n$$", "id": "2563388"}, {"introduction": "The flux of fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix is primarily controlled by the activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1), the rate-limiting enzyme of the carnitine shuttle.

The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or scientifically unsound premises.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe objective is to localize the metabolic block within the long-chain fatty acid import and oxidation pathway. The pathway, as described, is:\n$1$. Activation: $\\text{LCFA} \\rightarrow \\text{LC-acyl-CoA}$ (Cytosol)\n$2$. CPT1: $\\text{LC-acyl-CoA} + \\text{Carnitine (C0)} \\rightarrow \\text{LC-acylcarnitine} + \\text{CoA}$ (OMM/IMS)\n$3$. CACT: $\\text{LC-acylcarnitine}_{\\text{IMS}} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{LC-acylcarnitine}_{\\text{Matrix}}$ (in exchange for $\\text{Carnitine (C0)}_{\\text{Matrix}}$)\n$4$. CPT2: $\\text{LC-acylcarnitine}_{\\text{Matrix}} + \\text{CoA} \\rightarrow \\text{LC-acyl-CoA}_{\\text{Matrix}} + \\text{Carnitine (C0)}_{\\text{Matrix}}$\n$5$. $\\beta$-oxidation: $\\text{LC-acyl-CoA}_{\\text{Matrix}} \\rightarrow \\dots \\rightarrow \\text{Acetyl-CoA}$ (Matrix)\n$6$. Acetyl-CoA can form acetylcarnitine ($\\mathrm{C2}$).\n\nLet us analyze the provided biochemical markers in the context of this pathway:\n- **Markedly elevated $\\mathrm{C16}$ and $\\mathrm{C18{:}1}$ acylcarnitines**: This indicates that the reaction catalyzed by CPT1 (step $2$) is proceeding, converting long-chain acyl-CoAs into their carnitine esters. The block must therefore be downstream of CPT1. The accumulating species are palmitoylcarnitine ($\\mathrm{C16}$) and oleoylcarnitine ($\\mathrm{C18{:}1}$).\n- **Very low free carnitine ($\\mathrm{C0}$)**: The total body pool of carnitine is finite. The continuous conversion of free carnitine to acylcarnitines by CPT1, coupled with a block in recycling acylcarnitine back to free carnitine, leads to the sequestration of carnitine in its acylated form. This results in a severe depletion of the free carnitine pool. The modifier \"very low\" suggests a profound trapping mechanism.\n- **Low acetylcarnitine ($\\mathrm{C2}$)**: Acetylcarnitine is a buffered form of acetyl-CoA, the end product of $\\beta$-oxidation. Low $\\mathrm{C2}$ implies that the rate of $\\beta$-oxidation is severely diminished because the substrate, long-chain acyl-CoA, is not being successfully delivered to or processed within the mitochondrial matrix.\n- **Hypoglycemia with minimal ketones**: Fasting requires energy from fatty acid oxidation. A block in this pathway prevents the liver from producing ketone bodies (which are synthesized from acetyl-CoA) and running gluconeogenesis effectively, leading to hypoglycemia and hypoketonemia.\n\nCombining these observations, the block must be at a step that allows for the formation of long-chain acylcarnitines but prevents their ultimate conversion to acetyl-CoA in the matrix, while simultaneously causing a severe trapping of free carnitine. The candidates for the block are CACT, CPT2, or VLCAD (the first enzyme of $\\beta$-oxidation).\n\nA block at **CACT** (step $3$) means the antiporter that transports long-chain acylcarnitine into the matrix is nonfunctional. CPT1, which is functional, continuously consumes cytosolic free carnitine ($\\mathrm{C0}$) to produce long-chain acylcarnitines. These acylcarnitines accumulate in the intermembrane space and cytosol because they cannot enter the matrix. This process effectively and irreversibly (in the context of the block) sequesters the carnitine pool, leading to a profound depletion of free carnitine ($\\mathrm{C0}$). Since no acylcarnitine enters the matrix, no substrate is available for CPT2 or $\\beta$-oxidation, resulting in low acetylcarnitine ($\\mathrm{C2}$). This mechanism perfectly explains all observations, particularly the \"very low\" $\\mathrm{C0}$.\n\nA block at **CPT2** (step $4$) or **VLCAD** (step $5$) would also lead to elevated long-chain acylcarnitines and low acetylcarnitine. However, the mechanism of carnitine depletion is slightly different. Long-chain acylcarnitines can enter the matrix via CACT. The block occurs afterward, within the matrix. Acyl groups accumulate in the matrix (as LC-acylcarnitine in CPT2 deficiency, or as LC-acyl-CoA in VLCAD deficiency, which is then re-esterified to LC-acylcarnitine). These accumulating species can then reflux out of the mitochondrion. While this also causes carnitine depletion, a non-functional CACT provides the most direct and severe mechanism for trapping carnitine outside the matrix, aligning best with the \"very low\" $\\mathrm{C0}$ finding.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT2) deficiency; because long-chain acylcarnitines traverse the inner membrane via the intact antiporter, but cannot be converted back to acyl–coenzyme A in the matrix, they accumulate and reflux to blood; free carnitine remains normal because the antiporter continues to export matrix carnitine.**\nThe claim that \"free carnitine remains normal\" is fundamentally incorrect. CPT2 deficiency leads to secondary carnitine deficiency (low $\\mathrm{C0}$) due to the sequestration of carnitine as acylcarnitines. This contradicts the given data, which states $\\mathrm{C0}$ is \"very low,\" and also contradicts established pathophysiology.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Carnitine–acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) deficiency; because the antiporter is nonfunctional, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) sequesters cytosolic free carnitine as long-chain acylcarnitines that cannot enter the matrix, causing progressive systemic free carnitine depletion and accumulation of $\\mathrm{C16}$ and $\\mathrm{C18{:}1}$ in plasma; acetylcarnitine falls because matrix delivery of acyl units for $\\beta$-oxidation is curtailed.**\nThis option correctly identifies the block at CACT. The mechanistic explanation is fully consistent with all provided data points. A nonfunctional antiporter directly explains: ($1$) accumulation of $\\mathrm{C16}$/$\\mathrm{C18{:}1}$ because they cannot enter the matrix; ($2$) profound depletion of free carnitine ($\\mathrm{C0}$) due to sequestration by the active CPT1; and ($3$) low acetylcarnitine ($\\mathrm{C2}$) due to the complete halt of substrate delivery to the matrix for $\\beta$-oxidation. This is the most accurate and complete explanation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) deficiency; because the block at the outer membrane prevents formation of long-chain acylcarnitines, free carnitine falls while long-chain acylcarnitines rise.**\nThis statement is internally contradictory and factually incorrect. A deficiency in CPT1 would *prevent* the formation of long-chain acylcarnitines, meaning their levels would be low or absent. Consequently, free carnitine ($\\mathrm{C0}$) would not be consumed and would accumulate, leading to high levels. The observed data are the exact opposite.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Very-long-chain acyl–coenzyme A dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency; because the first dehydrogenation step of $\\beta$-oxidation is blocked, long-chain acylcarnitines $\\mathrm{C16}$ and $\\mathrm{C18{:}1}$ accumulate with very low free carnitine.**\nWhile an acylcarnitine profile from VLCAD deficiency can appear similar (high long-chain acylcarnitines, low free carnitine), the wording of option B provides a superior mechanistic explanation for the *severity* of the free carnitine depletion. The primary block of the transporter in CACT deficiency offers a more direct and potent mechanism for carnitine trapping than the secondary 'backup' effect in VLCAD deficiency. Therefore, given the \"very low $\\mathrm{C0}$\", CACT deficiency as described in option B is the better fit.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The pattern cannot localize the block beyond “carnitine shuttle dysfunction,” because CPT2 and CACT defects are indistinguishable by acylcarnitine profiling; both invariably produce identical degrees of free carnitine depletion and the same long-chain acylcarnitine elevations.**\nThis statement is an oversimplification. While CACT and severe CPT2 defects are very similar, they are not always biochemically identical. The degree of free carnitine depletion is often most profound in CACT deficiency, as explained above. The problem asks for the *best* localization, and based on the classic presentation described, a specific localization is possible and expected. Option B provides a precise localization with a coherent mechanism that fits perfectly. Therefore, declaring it impossible to distinguish is incorrect in this context.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2563375"}]}
