Do not include any units in your final expressions.", "solution": "The problem statement has been rigorously evaluated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained, permitting a formal derivation from the provided foundational principles. We shall now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive expressions for four quantities related to the complete $\\beta$-oxidation of an even-chain saturated fatty acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) with a carbon length of $n$, where $n$ is an even integer such that $n \\geq 4$. The quantities are: $C(n)$, the number of spiral turns; $N(n)$, the total NADH produced; $F(n)$, the total FADH$_{2}$ produced; and $A(n)$, the total acetyl-CoA produced. The derivation will be based exclusively on the facts provided.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for $A(n)$, the total number of acetyl-CoA molecules formed. The process described is the complete conversion of an $n$-carbon chain into acetyl-CoA molecules. Acetyl-CoA is a $2$-carbon molecule. According to the principle of conservation of mass, specifically the conservation of carbon atoms, all carbons from the initial $n$-carbon acyl-CoA must be accounted for in the final products. Since acetyl-CoA is the sole carbon-containing product of the spiral itself, we can write the following balance equation:\n$$ n = A(n) \\times 2 $$\nwhere $n$ is the total number of carbons in the initial substrate and $A(n) \\times 2$ is the total number of carbons in the resulting acetyl-CoA molecules. Solving for $A(n)$ yields:\n$$ A(n) = \\frac{n}{2} $$\nThis expression is valid because $n$ is defined as an even integer, ensuring that $A(n)$ is always an integer.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for $C(n)$, the total number of turns of the $\\beta$-oxidation spiral. Each turn of the spiral involves a thiolytic cleavage that releases one molecule of acetyl-CoA and shortens the acyl-CoA chain by $2$ carbons. This process can be conceptualized as sequentially breaking an $n$-carbon chain into $\\frac{n}{2}$ two-carbon units. To sever a linear chain of $k$ linked objects into its constituent components, one must perform $k-1$ cuts. In this biochemical context, each \"cut\" is a thiolytic cleavage, which corresponds to one turn of the spiral. The number of $2$-carbon units to be produced is $k = A(n) = \\frac{n}{2}$.\nTherefore, the number of cleavages, or turns $C(n)$, is given by:\n$$ C(n) = k - 1 = A(n) - 1 $$\nSubstituting the previously derived expression for $A(n)$:\n$$ C(n) = \\frac{n}{2} - 1 $$\nLet us verify this logic. The process terminates when the remaining acyl-CoA is a $4$-carbon chain (butyryl-CoA). This final substrate undergoes one last turn of the spiral to yield two molecules of acetyl-CoA. A chain of length $n$ requires a total of $\\frac{n-4}{2}$ cycles to be shortened to a $4$-carbon chain. The final cycle on the $4$-carbon chain brings the total to $(\\frac{n-4}{2}) + 1 = \\frac{n}{2} - 2 + 1 = \\frac{n}{2} - 1$. The reasoning is consistent.\n\nFinally, we derive the expressions for $N(n)$ and $F(n)$, the total number of NADH and FADH$_{2}$ molecules formed. The problem statement provides a crucial fact: \"Each turn of the $\\beta$-oxidation spiral ... yields exactly one molecule each of FADH$_{2}$ and NADH.\" This establishes a direct stoichiometric relationship between the number of spiral turns and the production of these reduced coenzymes.\nFor each of the $C(n)$ turns, one molecule of NADH is produced. Thus, the total number of NADH molecules is:\n$$ N(n) = 1 \\times C(n) = C(n) $$\nSimilarly, for each of the $C(n)$ turns, one molecule of FADH$_{2}$ is produced. Thus, the total number of FADH$_{2}$ molecules is:\n$$ F(n) = 1 \\times C(n) = C(n) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $C(n)$ into these relationships, we obtain:\n$$ N(n) = \\frac{n}{2} - 1 $$\n$$ F(n) = \\frac{n}{2} - 1 $$\n\nIn summary, the derived expressions are:\n- Total number of spiral turns: $C(n) = \\frac{n}{2} - 1$\n- Total number of NADH molecules: $N(n) = \\frac{n}{2} - 1$\n- Total number of FADH$_{2}$ molecules: $F(n) = \\frac{n}{2} - 1$\n- Total number of acetyl-CoA molecules: $A(n) = \\frac{n}{2}$\n\nThese expressions are presented in the required order.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{n}{2} - 1 & \\frac{n}{2} - 1 & \\frac{n}{2} - 1 & \\frac{n}{2} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2616503"}, {"introduction": "With the stoichiometric tools in hand, we now turn to a central question in bioenergetics: what is the total energy yield from a fatty acid?

The complete aerobic oxidation of palmitate ($\\mathrm{C}_{16}\\!:\\!0$) will be analyzed in sequential stages: activation, $\\beta$-oxidation, citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation.\n\n**Stage 1: Activation of Palmitate**\nThe initial step is the activation of the free fatty acid palmitate into its metabolically active form, palmitoyl–CoA. The problem states this process consumes energy equivalent to $2$ molecules of $\\mathrm{ATP}$. This represents an initial energy investment.\nCost of activation $= -2$ $\\mathrm{ATP}$ equivalents.\n\n**Stage 2: β-Oxidation of Palmitoyl–CoA**\nPalmitoyl–CoA has a $16$-carbon acyl chain. The goal of $\\beta$-oxidation is to cleave this chain into $2$-carbon acetyl–CoA units. We must determine the number of cycles required and the total yield of reducing equivalents and acetyl–CoA.\nFor a fatty acid with $n$ carbon atoms, the number of acetyl–CoA units produced is $n/2$. For palmitate, $n=16$, so the number of acetyl–CoA molecules is $16/2 = 8$.\nThe number of $\\beta$-oxidation cycles required for a saturated, even-chain fatty acid is $(n/2) - 1$. For palmitate, this is $(16/2) - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7$ cycles.\nThis is consistent with the provided description: $6$ cycles each release one acetyl–CoA, leaving a $4$-carbon acyl–CoA (butyryl–CoA). The $7^{th}$ and final cycle cleaves this $4$-carbon unit into two acetyl–CoA molecules. In total, $6 + 2 = 8$ acetyl–CoA molecules are produced over $7$ cycles.\nAccording to the problem, each of the $7$ cycles yields $1$ $\\mathrm{NADH}$ and $1$ $\\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$.\nTherefore, the total yield from the $\\beta$-oxidation of one molecule of palmitoyl–CoA is:\n- Acetyl–CoA: $8$ molecules\n- $\\mathrm{NADH}$: $7 \\times 1 = 7$ molecules\n- $\\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$: $7 \\times 1 = 7$ molecules\n\n**Stage 3: Citric Acid Cycle (TCA Cycle)**\nThe $8$ molecules of acetyl–CoA produced in Stage 2 now enter the citric acid cycle for complete oxidation to $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. The problem provides the yield per turn of the cycle (i.e., per molecule of acetyl–CoA).\nYield per acetyl–CoA: $3$ $\\mathrm{NADH}$, $1$ $\\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$, $1$ $\\mathrm{GTP}$.\nFor $8$ molecules of acetyl–CoA, the total yield from the citric acid cycle is:\n- $\\mathrm{NADH}$: $8 \\times 3 = 24$ molecules\n- $\\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$: $8 \\times 1 = 8$ molecules\n- $\\mathrm{GTP}$: $8 \\times 1 = 8$ molecules\n\n**Stage 4: ATP Synthesis via Oxidative Phosphorylation and Substrate-Level Phosphorylation**\nFirst, we aggregate the total number of reducing equivalents ($\\mathrm{NADH}$ and $\\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$) generated from both $\\beta$-oxidation and the citric acid cycle.\n- Total $\\mathrm{NADH}$ = (from $\\beta$-oxidation) + (from TCA cycle) = $7 + 24 = 31$ molecules.\n- Total $\\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$ = (from $\\beta$-oxidation) + (from TCA cycle) = $7 + 8 = 15$ molecules.\n\nNext, we use the given P/O ratios to calculate the ATP yield from the re-oxidation of these coenzymes in the electron transport chain.\n- $\\mathrm{ATP}$ from $\\mathrm{NADH}$: $31$ $\\mathrm{NADH} \\times 2.5$ $\\mathrm{ATP}/\\mathrm{NADH}$ = $77.5$ $\\mathrm{ATP}$.\n- $\\mathrm{ATP}$ from $\\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$: $15$ $\\mathrm{FADH}_{2} \\times 1.5$ $\\mathrm{ATP}/\\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$ = $22.5$ $\\mathrm{ATP}$.\n\nAdditionally, the citric acid cycle produces $\\mathrm{GTP}$ via substrate-level phosphorylation. $\\mathrm{GTP}$ is energetically equivalent to $\\mathrm{ATP}$.\n- $\\mathrm{ATP}$ equivalents from $\\mathrm{GTP}$: $8$ $\\mathrm{GTP} = 8$ $\\mathrm{ATP}$.\n\nThe total gross production of $\\mathrm{ATP}$ equivalents is the sum of these amounts.\nGross $\\mathrm{ATP}$ yield = ($77.5$) + ($22.5$) + ($8$) = $100 + 8 = 108$ $\\mathrm{ATP}$ equivalents.\n\n**Final Calculation: Net ATP Yield**\nTo find the net yield, we subtract the initial activation cost from the gross yield.\nNet $\\mathrm{ATP}$ yield = Gross $\\mathrm{ATP}$ yield - Activation cost\nNet $\\mathrm{ATP}$ yield = $108 - 2 = 106$ $\\mathrm{ATP}$ equivalents.\n\nThe complete aerobic oxidation of one molecule of palmitate yields a net total of $106$ $\\mathrm{ATP}$ equivalents under the specified conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{106}$$", "id": "2616606"}, {"introduction": "The robustness of metabolic pathways is often best appreciated by exploring what happens when they go wrong.
