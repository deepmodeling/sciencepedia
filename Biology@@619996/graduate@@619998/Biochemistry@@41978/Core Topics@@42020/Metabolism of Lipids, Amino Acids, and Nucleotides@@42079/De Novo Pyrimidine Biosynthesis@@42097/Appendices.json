The problem is therefore deemed valid and a full solution is provided below.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the velocity equation $v([\\mathrm{Asp}])$\nThe Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model posits a conformational equilibrium between a Tense (T) state and a Relaxed (R) state. The allosteric constant $L_{0}$ is the equilibrium ratio of these states in the absence of any ligands: $L_{0} = [\\mathrm{T}_{0}]/[\\mathrm{R}_{0}]$. The problem states that catalysis occurs exclusively from the R state. Therefore, the reaction velocity $v$ is proportional to the concentration of substrate-bound catalytic sites on R-state protomers. The velocity is given by $v = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{R} \\times (\\text{concentration of substrate-bound R-state sites})$.\n\nLet $[E]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ be the total enzyme concentration. The maximum velocity is defined as $V_{\\max} = n\\,k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{R}\\,[E]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$. The velocity can be expressed in terms of the fractional saturation of the R state with substrate, $\\bar{Y}_{R}$, and the fraction of total enzyme in the R state, $\\bar{R}$:\n$$v = V_{\\max} \\cdot \\bar{R} \\cdot \\bar{Y}_{R}$$\nThe fractional saturation of the R-state catalytic sites, assuming they are identical and non-interacting within the protomer, follows the Michaelis-Menten form:\n$$\\bar{Y}_{R} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{Asp}]/K_{R}^{S}}{1+[\\mathrm{Asp}]/K_{R}^{S}} = \\frac{x}{1+x}$$\nwhere $x = [\\mathrm{Asp}]/K_{R}^{S}$ is the dimensionless substrate concentration.\n\nThe fraction of enzyme in the R state, $\\bar{R}$, is determined by the equilibrium between all R-state species and all T-state species. This equilibrium is governed by an effective allosteric constant $L^{*}$ that accounts for the differential binding of all ligands (substrate S, activator A, and inhibitor I) to the T and R states.\n$$L^{*} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{T}]_{\\mathrm{total}}}{[\\mathrm{R}]_{\\mathrm{total}}} = L_{0} \\frac{Q_{T}}{Q_{R}}$$\nHere, $Q_{R}$ and $Q_{T}$ are the partition functions for ligand binding to the R and T states, respectively.\nFor the $n$ catalytic sites binding substrate (S), the partition functions are:\n$$Q_{R}^{S} = (1+x)^n$$\n$$Q_{T}^{S} = (1+[\\mathrm{Asp}]/K_{T}^{S})^n = (1+x \\cdot K_{R}^{S}/K_{T}^{S})^n = (1+c_{S}x)^n$$\nFor the $m$ regulatory sites, which bind ATP (A) and CTP (I) competitively, the partition function for a single site in the R state is $(1 + [\\mathrm{ATP}]/K_{A}^{R} + [\\mathrm{CTP}]/K_{I}^{R}) = (1+y_{A}+y_{I})$. For $m$ such sites, the partition function is:\n$$Q_{R}^{A,I} = (1+y_{A}+y_{I})^m$$\nSimilarly, for the T state, we define dimensionless concentrations relative to T-state affinities: $[\\mathrm{ATP}]/K_{A}^{T} = y_{A}c_{A}$ and $[\\mathrm{CTP}]/K_{I}^{T} = y_{I}c_{I}$. The partition function for the $m$ regulatory sites in the T state is:\n$$Q_{T}^{A,I} = (1+y_{A}c_{A}+y_{I}c_{I})^m$$\nThe total partition functions are $Q_{R} = Q_{R}^{S} Q_{R}^{A,I}$ and $Q_{T} = Q_{T}^{S} Q_{T}^{A,I}$. Thus, the effective allosteric constant is:\n$$L^{*} = L_{0} \\frac{(1+c_{S}x)^n (1+y_{A}c_{A}+y_{I}c_{I})^m}{(1+x)^n (1+y_{A}+y_{I})^m}$$\nThe fraction of enzyme in the R state is $\\bar{R} = 1/(1+L^{*})$. Substituting this and $\\bar{Y}_{R}$ into the velocity equation gives:\n$$\\frac{v}{V_{\\max}} = \\frac{1}{1+L^{*}} \\frac{x}{1+x} = \\frac{1}{1 + L_{0} \\frac{(1+c_{S}x)^n (1+y_{A}c_{A}+y_{I}c_{I})^m}{(1+x)^n (1+y_{A}+y_{I})^m}} \\frac{x}{1+x}$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the desired closed-form expression for the normalized velocity, which must be what the problem requests as all aformentioned parameters are dimensionless:\n$$\\frac{v}{V_{\\max}} = \\frac{x(1+x)^{n-1}(1+y_{A}+y_{I})^m}{(1+x)^n(1+y_{A}+y_{I})^m + L_{0}(1+c_{S}x)^n(1+y_{A}c_{A}+y_{I}c_{I})^m}$$\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the Hill coefficient $n_{H}$\nThe Hill coefficient is defined as $n_{H} = \\left.\\dfrac{d\\ln(v/(V_{\\max}-v))}{d\\ln [\\mathrm{Asp}]}\\right|_{v=V_{\\max}/2}$.\nLet $\\nu = v/V_{\\max}$. The term inside the logarithm is $\\nu/(1-\\nu)$. From Part 1, we can write $\\nu$ more compactly as $\\nu = \\frac{x(1+x)^{n-1}}{L(1+c_{S}x)^n + (1+x)^n}$, where $L$ is the effective allosteric constant that consolidates the effects of $L_0$ and the allosteric effectors:\n$$L = L_{0} \\left(\\frac{1+c_{A}y_{A}+c_{I}y_{I}}{1+y_{A}+y_{I}}\\right)^m$$\nThe expression for $\\nu/(1-\\nu)$, denoted by $\\theta$, is:\n$$1-\\nu = \\frac{L(1+c_{S}x)^n+(1+x)^{n-1}(1+x-x)}{L(1+c_{S}x)^n + (1+x)^n} = \\frac{L(1+c_{S}x)^n+(1+x)^{n-1}}{L(1+c_{S}x)^n + (1+x)^n}$$\n$$\\theta = \\frac{\\nu}{1-\\nu} = \\frac{x(1+x)^{n-1}}{L(1+c_{S}x)^n + (1+x)^{n-1}}$$\nSince $x = [\\mathrm{Asp}]/K_{R}^{S}$, we have $d\\ln [\\mathrm{Asp}] = d\\ln x$. So, $n_{H} = \\frac{d\\ln\\theta}{d\\ln x} = \\frac{x}{\\theta}\\frac{d\\theta}{dx}$.\nA more direct method is to differentiate $\\ln\\theta$:\n$$\\ln\\theta = \\ln x + (n-1)\\ln(1+x) - \\ln(L(1+c_{S}x)^n + (1+x)^{n-1})$$\n$$n_{H} = \\frac{d\\ln\\theta}{d\\ln x} = x\\frac{d(\\ln\\theta)}{dx} = 1 + \\frac{(n-1)x}{1+x} - x\\frac{Lnc_{S}(1+c_{S}x)^{n-1} + (n-1)(1+x)^{n-2}}{L(1+c_{S}x)^n + (1+x)^{n-1}}$$\nThis expression is evaluated at half-maximal velocity, where $\\nu=1/2$, so $\\theta=1$. Let $x_{0.5}$ be the value of $x$ at this point. The condition $\\theta=1$ implies:\n$$x_{0.5}(1+x_{0.5})^{n-1} = L(1+c_{S}x_{0.5})^n + (1+x_{0.5})^{n-1}$$\n$$(x_{0.5}-1)(1+x_{0.5})^{n-1} = L(1+c_{S}x_{0.5})^n$$\nThis allows us to substitute for $L$ or for the denominator in the $n_H$ expression. At $x=x_{0.5}$, the denominator is $L(1+c_{S}x_{0.5})^n + (1+x_{0.5})^{n-1} = x_{0.5}(1+x_{0.5})^{n-1}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $n_H$:\n$$n_{H} = 1 + \\frac{(n-1)x_{0.5}}{1+x_{0.5}} - x_{0.5}\\frac{Lnc_{S}(1+c_{S}x_{0.5})^{n-1} + (n-1)(1+x_{0.5})^{n-2}}{x_{0.5}(1+x_{0.5})^{n-1}}$$\n$$n_{H} = 1 + \\frac{(n-1)x_{0.5}}{1+x_{0.5}} - \\frac{Lnc_{S}(1+c_{S}x_{0.5})^{n-1}}{(1+x_{0.5})^{n-1}} - \\frac{n-1}{1+x_{0.5}}$$\n$$n_{H} = 1 + \\frac{(n-1)(x_{0.5}-1)}{1+x_{0.5}} - \\frac{Lnc_{S}(1+c_{S}x_{0.5})^{n-1}}{(1+x_{0.5})^{n-1}}$$\nNow, substitute the expression for $L$ from the $\\theta=1$ condition: $L = \\frac{(x_{0.5}-1)(1+x_{0.5})^{n-1}}{(1+c_{S}x_{0.5})^n}$.\n$$n_{H} = 1 + \\frac{(n-1)(x_{0.5}-1)}{1+x_{0.5}} - \\frac{(x_{0.5}-1)(1+x_{0.5})^{n-1}}{(1+c_{S}x_{0.5})^n} \\frac{nc_{S}(1+c_{S}x_{0.5})^{n-1}}{(1+x_{0.5})^{n-1}}$$\n$$n_{H} = 1 + \\frac{(n-1)(x_{0.5}-1)}{1+x_{0.5}} - \\frac{nc_{S}(x_{0.5}-1)}{1+c_{S}x_{0.5}}$$\nFactoring out $(x_{0.5}-1)$ gives the final expression for the Hill coefficient:\n$$n_{H} = 1 + (x_{0.5}-1)\\left[\\frac{n-1}{1+x_{0.5}} - \\frac{nc_{S}}{1+c_{S}x_{0.5}}\\right]$$\n\nPart 3: Numerical evaluation of $n_{H}$\nIn the absence of effectors, $y_{A}=0$ and $y_{I}=0$. The effective allosteric constant $L$ becomes $L=L_{0}$. The parameters are given as $n=6$, $m=6$, $c_{S}=0.1$, and $L_{0}=15625/192$.\nFirst, we must find $x_{0.5}$ by solving the condition for half-saturation with these parameters:\n$$(x_{0.5}-1)(1+x_{0.5})^{n-1} = L_{0}(1+c_{S}x_{0.5})^n$$\n$$(x_{0.5}-1)(1+x_{0.5})^{5} = \\frac{15625}{192}(1+0.1x_{0.5})^6$$\nWe test for a simple integer solution. Let's try $x_{0.5}=2$:\nLeft-hand side (LHS): $(2-1)(1+2)^{5} = 1 \\cdot 3^{5} = 243$.\nRight-hand side (RHS): $\\frac{15625}{192}(1+0.1 \\cdot 2)^6 = \\frac{15625}{192}(1.2)^6 = \\frac{5^6}{3 \\cdot 2^6} \\left(\\frac{6}{5}\\right)^6 = \\frac{5^6}{3 \\cdot 2^6} \\frac{6^6}{5^6} = \\frac{(2\\cdot 3)^6}{3 \\cdot 2^6} = \\frac{2^6 \\cdot 3^6}{3 \\cdot 2^6} = 3^5 = 243$.\nSince LHS = RHS, $x_{0.5}=2$ is the correct solution.\nNow, we substitute $n=6$, $c_{S}=0.1$, and $x_{0.5}=2$ into the expression for $n_{H}$:\n$$n_{H} = 1 + (2-1)\\left[\\frac{6-1}{1+2} - \\frac{6 \\cdot 0.1}{1+0.1 \\cdot 2}\\right]$$\n$$n_{H} = 1 + (1)\\left[\\frac{5}{3} - \\frac{0.6}{1.2}\\right]$$\n$$n_{H} = 1 + \\frac{5}{3} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{6}{6} + \\frac{10}{6} - \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{13}{6}$$\nAs a decimal, $13/6 = 2.1666...$.

Reduction of ubiquinone:\n    Ubiquinone (Q) + $2H^+$ + $2e^-$ $\\rightarrow$ Ubiquinol (QH$_2$)\n    This corresponds to the ubiquinone/ubiquinol couple, for which the standard midpoint potential is given as $E^\\circ{}'_{\\text{Q/QH}_2} = +0.045\\,\\text{V}$. This couple serves as the electron acceptor.\n\nThe standard potential difference for the overall reaction, $\\Delta E^\\circ{}'$, is calculated as the potential of the electron-accepting couple minus the potential of the electron-donating couple:\n$$\n\\Delta E^\\circ{}' = E^\\circ{}'_{(\\text{acceptor})} - E^\\circ{}'_{(\\text{donor})}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\Delta E^\\circ{}' = E^\\circ{}'_{\\text{Q/QH}_2} - E^\\circ{}'_{\\text{DHO/ORO}} = (+0.045\\,\\text{V}) - (-0.31\\,\\text{V})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E^\\circ{}' = 0.045\\,\\text{V} + 0.31\\,\\text{V} = +0.355\\,\\text{V}\n$$\nA positive value for $\\Delta E^\\circ{}'$ confirms that the direction of electron flow from dihydroorotate to ubiquinone is spontaneous under standard conditions.\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard Gibbs energy change, $\\Delta G^\\circ{}'$, using the fundamental equation.
