This costs $2 \\times 1 = 2$ ATP equivalents.\n- The pathway proceeds to form orotate. Orotate is then converted to orotidine monophosphate (OMP) by orotate phosphoribosyltransferase, which uses PRPP. This step requires the synthesis of PRPP ($2$ ATP equivalents) and involves the release and subsequent hydrolysis of $PP_i$ ($1$ ATP equivalent).\n- OMP is then decarboxylated to UMP with no ATP cost.\nThe total cost for *de novo* UMP synthesis is:\n$$C_{UMP, de\\_novo} = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 \\text{ ATP equivalents}$$\n\nThe salvage pathway for UMP, $C_{UMP, salvage}$, uses uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT).\n- Synthesis of PRPP is required: $2$ ATP equivalents.\n- The UPRT reaction, Uracil $+$ PRPP $\\to$ UMP $+$ $PP_i$, releases pyrophosphate.

We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to analyze the competitive kinetics of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) with its two substrates, hypoxanthine ($\\mathrm{Hx}$) and guanine ($\\mathrm{G}$). The concentration of the cosubstrate, 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), is saturating, which simplifies the kinetic model to a single-substrate form with respect to the purine base.\n\nFirst, we compute the catalytic efficiency for each substrate. The catalytic efficiency is defined as the ratio of the catalytic turnover number ($k_{cat}$) to the Michaelis constant ($K_m$), represented as $\\frac{k_{cat}}{K_m}$. This value represents the apparent second-order rate constant for the reaction at low substrate concentrations.\n\nFor hypoxanthine ($\\mathrm{Hx}$), the given parameters are $k_{cat,\\mathrm{Hx}} = 18\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $K_{m,\\mathrm{Hx}} = 4.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.

The rate of uric acid production from non-salvaged dietary influx, $v_{\\mathrm{UA, influx}}$, is given by the total influx of purine bases minus the effective rates of their salvage:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{UA, influx}} = (J_{H} - v_{\\mathrm{HGPRT, eff}}) + (J_{A} - v_{\\mathrm{APRT, eff}})$$\nThe effective salvage rates are capped by the corresponding base influxes:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{HGPRT, eff}} = \\min(v_{\\mathrm{HGPRT}}, J_{H})$$\n$$v_{\\mathrm{APRT, eff}} = \\min(v_{\\mathrm{APRT}}, J_{A})$$\nThe kinetic rates $v_{\\mathrm{HGPRT}}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{APRT}}$ are functions of the PRPP concentration.\n\n$2$. The rate of uric acid production from de novo synthesis, $v_{\\mathrm{UA, de\\ novo}}$, is a fixed fraction, $f$, of the total de novo synthesis rate, $J_{\\mathrm{de\\ novo}}$:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{UA, de\\ novo}} = f \\cdot J_{\\mathrm{de\\ novo}}$$\nThe de novo synthesis rate is also a function of the PRPP concentration.\n\nWe will now calculate $v_{\\mathrm{UA}}$ for both the wild-type and gain-of-function states. The parameters given are:\nFor salvage: $V_{\\max,H} = 300$, $K_{P,H} = 0.03$; $V_{\\max,A} = 100$, $K_{P,A} = 0.02$.\nFor de novo synthesis: $V_{\\max,D} = 600$, $K_{P,D} = 0.05$.\nInfluxes: $J_{H} = 400$, $J_{A} = 200$.\nCatabolic fraction: $f = 0.9$.\nAll rates are in units of $\\mathrm{nmol} \\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{g}^{-1}$ and concentrations are in $\\mathrm{mM}$.\n\n**Case 1: Wild-Type (wt) State**\nThe steady-state PRPP concentration is given as $[\\mathrm{PRPP}]_{\\mathrm{wt}} = 0.05 \\ \\mathrm{mM}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the kinetic rates of the salvage pathways:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{HGPRT, wt}} = V_{\\max,H} \\frac{[\\mathrm{PRPP}]_{\\mathrm{wt}}}{K_{P,H} + [\\mathrm{PRPP}]_{\\mathrm{wt}}} = 300 \\frac{0.05}{0.03 + 0.05} = 300 \\frac{0.05}{0.08} = 300 \\left(\\frac{5}{8}\\right) = 187.5$$\n$$v_{\\mathrm{APRT, wt}} = V_{\\max,A} \\frac{[\\mathrm{PRPP}]_{\\mathrm{wt}}}{K_{P,A} + [\\mathrm{PRPP}]_{\\mathrm{wt}}} = 100 \\frac{0.05}{0.02 + 0.05} = 100 \\frac{0.05}{0.07} = 100 \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) = \\frac{500}{7} \\approx 71.43$$\nNext, we check for capping against the influxes $J_H = 400$ and $J_A = 200$.\nSince $v_{\\mathrm{HGPRT, wt}} = 187.5 < 400$, the rate is not capped: $v_{\\mathrm{HGPRT, eff, wt}} = 187.5$.\nSince $v_{\\mathrm{APRT, wt}} = \\frac{500}{7} < 200$, the rate is not capped: $v_{\\mathrm{APRT, eff, wt}} = \\frac{500}{7}$.\nThe uric acid production from non-salvaged influx is:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{UA, influx, wt}} = (400 - 187.5) + \\left(200 - \\frac{500}{7}\\right) = 212.5 + \\frac{1400 - 500}{7} = \\frac{425}{2} + \\frac{900}{7} = \\frac{2975 + 1800}{14} = \\frac{4775}{14}$$\nNow, we compute the rate of de novo synthesis:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{de\\ novo, wt}} = V_{\\max,D} \\frac{[\\mathrm{PRPP}]_{\\mathrm{wt}}}{K_{P,D} + [\\mathrm{PRPP}]_{\\mathrm{wt}}} = 600 \\frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.05} = 600 \\frac{0.05}{0.10} = 600 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 300$$\nThe uric acid production from de novo synthesis is:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{UA, de\\ novo, wt}} = f \\cdot J_{\\mathrm{de\\ novo, wt}} = 0.9 \\cdot 300 = 270$$\nThe total uric acid production rate in the wild-type state is the sum of these two components:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{UA, wt}} = v_{\\mathrm{UA, influx, wt}} + v_{\\mathrm{UA, de\\ novo, wt}} = \\frac{4775}{14} + 270 = \\frac{4775 + 3780}{14} = \\frac{8555}{14}$$\n\n**Case 2: Gain-of-Function (gof) State**\nThe steady-state PRPP concentration is given as $[\\mathrm{PRPP}]_{\\mathrm{gof}} = 0.15 \\ \\mathrm{mM}$.\n\nWe compute the kinetic rates of the salvage pathways:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{HGPRT, gof}} = V_{\\max,H} \\frac{[\\mathrm{PRPP}]_{\\mathrm{gof}}}{K_{P,H} + [\\mathrm{PRPP}]_{\\mathrm{gof}}} = 300 \\frac{0.15}{0.03 + 0.15} = 300 \\frac{0.15}{0.18} = 300 \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right) = 250$$\n$$v_{\\mathrm{APRT, gof}} = V_{\\max,A} \\frac{[\\mathrm{PRPP}]_{\\mathrm{gof}}}{K_{P,A} + [\\mathrm{PRPP}]_{\\mathrm{gof}}} = 100 \\frac{0.15}{0.02 + 0.15} = 100 \\frac{0.15}{0.17} = 100 \\left(\\frac{15}{17}\\right) = \\frac{1500}{17} \\approx 88.24$$\nWe check for capping:\nSince $v_{\\mathrm{HGPRT, gof}} = 250 < 400$, the rate is not capped: $v_{\\mathrm{HGPRT, eff, gof}} = 250$.\nSince $v_{\\mathrm{APRT, gof}} = \\frac{1500}{17} < 200$, the rate is not capped: $v_{\\mathrm{APRT, eff, gof}} = \\frac{1500}{17}$.\nThe uric acid production from non-salvaged influx is:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{UA, influx, gof}} = (400 - 250) + \\left(200 - \\frac{1500}{17}\\right) = 150 + \\frac{3400 - 1500}{17} = 150 + \\frac{1900}{17} = \\frac{2550 + 1900}{17} = \\frac{4450}{17}$$\nNow, we compute the rate of de novo synthesis:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{de\\ novo, gof}} = V_{\\max,D} \\frac{[\\mathrm{PRPP}]_{\\mathrm{gof}}}{K_{P,D} + [\\mathrm{PRPP}]_{\\mathrm{gof}}} = 600 \\frac{0.15}{0.05 + 0.15} = 600 \\frac{0.15}{0.20} = 600 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = 450$$\nThe uric acid production from de novo synthesis is:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{UA, de\\ novo, gof}} = f \\cdot J_{\\mathrm{de\\ novo, gof}} = 0.9 \\cdot 450 = 405$$\nThe total uric acid production rate in the gain-of-function state is:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{UA, gof}} = v_{\\mathrm{UA, influx, gof}} + v_{\\mathrm{UA, de\\ novo, gof}} = \\frac{4450}{17} + 405 = \\frac{4450 + 6885}{17} = \\frac{11335}{17}$$\n\n**Calculation of the Ratio $\\mathcal{R}$**\nFinally, we compute the ratio $\\mathcal{R}$ of the two rates:\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{UA, gof}}}{v_{\\mathrm{UA, wt}}} = \\frac{11335/17}{8555/14} = \\frac{11335}{17} \\times \\frac{14}{8555} = \\frac{158690}{145435}$$\nConverting this to a decimal value:\n$$\\mathcal{R} \\approx 1.09113924$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we obtain $\\mathcal{R} = 1.091$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.091}\n$$", "id": "2583594"}]}
