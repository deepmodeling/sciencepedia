Glucose is phosphorylated to glucose-$6$-phosphate by hexokinase using ATP.\n    2. Glucose-$6$-phosphate is isomerized to glucose-$1$-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase.\n    3. Glucose-$1$-phosphate is activated to uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-glucose) by UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase using UTP, releasing pyrophosphate (PPi) that is hydrolyzed.\n    4. Glycogen synthase transfers the glucosyl unit from UDP-glucose to glycogen, releasing UDP.\n    5. The branching enzyme forms branches by transglycosylation without direct NTP hydrolysis.\n    6. Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) regenerates UTP from UDP at the expense of ATP.\n- Assumptions:\n    - Ignore costs unrelated to these steps.\n    - No futile cycles.\n    - Every incorporated residue originates from free glucose.\n- $N = 10^6$ is the number of glucose residues to be incorporated.\n- **Goals**:\n    1. Compute the total ATP equivalents required to incorporate $N$ residues.\n    2. Compute the fraction of that total cost attributable specifically to UTP regeneration via NDPK.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is subjected to validation against the specified criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes the canonical biochemical pathway for glycogen synthesis from glucose. All steps, enzymes, and molecules (ATP, UTP, UDP-glucose, etc.) are standard components of established metabolic knowledge. The energetic accounting principle is also standard in biochemistry. The problem is factually and scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a clear set of reactions and a precise definition of \"ATP equivalent\". The initial conditions (free glucose) and the final state (glycogen polymer) are clearly defined. The assumptions (no futile cycles, ignore other costs) serve to bound the problem, ensuring a unique solution can be derived from the provided information.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language. It requests a quantitative calculation based on stoichiometric principles, free from subjectivity or opinion.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The set of reactions forms a complete cycle for the incorporation of glucose and the regeneration of necessary cofactors (UTP). The information is self-contained and internally consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a well-defined, scientifically grounded problem in stoichiometry and bioenergetics. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution requires a stoichiometric analysis of the provided reaction pathway to determine the net consumption of ATP equivalents for the incorporation of a single glucose residue into glycogen. This per-residue cost is then scaled by the total number of residues, $N$.\n\nLet us analyze the cost, in ATP equivalents, for each step in the processing of one molecule of glucose:\n\n1.  **Phosphorylation of Glucose**: The reaction catalyzed by hexokinase (or glucokinase in the liver) is:\n    $$ \\text{Glucose} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{Glucose-6-phosphate} + \\text{ADP} $$\n    This step directly consumes one molecule of ATP. The cost is $1$ ATP equivalent.\n\n2.  **Isomerization**: The reaction catalyzed by phosphoglucomutase is:\n    $$ \\text{Glucose-6-phosphate} \\leftrightarrow \\text{Glucose-1-phosphate} $$\n    This is an isomerization reaction with no consumption of nucleoside triphosphates. The cost is $0$ ATP equivalents.\n\n3.  **Activation of Glucose and UTP/UDP Cycle**: This involves several specified steps.\n    - First, glucose-$1$-phosphate is activated by UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase:\n      $$ \\text{Glucose-1-phosphate} + \\text{UTP} \\rightarrow \\text{UDP-glucose} + \\text{PPi} $$\n    - Second, the glucosyl unit is transferred to the glycogen chain by glycogen synthase, releasing UDP:\n      $$ \\text{UDP-glucose} + \\text{Glycogen}_{(n)} \\rightarrow \\text{Glycogen}_{(n+1)} + \\text{UDP} $$\n    - Third, the UDP produced must be regenerated to UTP to allow the cycle to continue. This is accomplished by nucleoside diphosphate kinase, as stated in the problem:\n      $$ \\text{UDP} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{UTP} + \\text{ADP} $$\n    Analyzing this sub-cycle, for each glucose residue that is activated and incorporated, one molecule of UTP is consumed, one molecule of UDP is produced, and this UDP is recycled back to UTP at the cost of one molecule of ATP. Therefore, the net cost of activating one glucose residue is $1$ ATP equivalent, paid at the NDPK step.\n\n4.  **Pyrophosphate Hydrolysis**: The problem states that the pyrophosphate (PPi) released in the UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase step is hydrolyzed.\n    $$ \\text{PPi} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow 2 \\text{Pi} $$\n    This is a highly exergonic reaction. Its role is to render the activation step (UDP-glucose synthesis) thermodynamically irreversible, thus ensuring the overall process of glycogen synthesis proceeds efficiently. While the hydrolysis of the high-energy bond in PPi is energetically equivalent to an ATP hydrolysis, in this stoichiometric accounting based on the provided reaction network, the cost is tallied by counting the NTPs consumed by the kinases. The net reaction derived from the given cycle already accounts for the total ATP input required to drive the entire process. The two direct points of ATP consumption are the hexokinase and NDPK reactions.\n\n5.  **Branching**: The branching enzyme performs a transglycosylation, moving a segment of an $\\alpha(1 \\rightarrow 4)$ chain to an $\\alpha(1 \\rightarrow 6)$ position. This reaction does not consume ATP or any other NTP. The cost is $0$ ATP equivalents.\n\n**Summary of Costs per Glucose Residue**:\n- Phosphorylation (Hexokinase): $1$ ATP equivalent.\n- Activation and UTP Regeneration (UDPG PPase / Glycogen Synthase / NDPK cycle): $1$ ATP equivalent.\n- Other steps (Phosphoglucomutase, Branching Enzyme): $0$ ATP equivalents.\n\nThe total cost to incorporate one glucose residue into glycogen is the sum of these costs:\n$$ \\text{Total Cost per Residue} = 1 + 1 = 2 \\text{ ATP equivalents} $$\n\n**Calculation for $N$ Residues**:\nThe problem asks for the total cost for $N = 10^6$ residues.\n$$ \\text{Total ATP Equivalents} = N \\times (\\text{Total Cost per Residue}) = 10^6 \\times 2 = 2 \\times 10^6 $$\n\n**Calculation of the Fraction**:\nThe problem asks for the fraction of the total cost attributable specifically to UTP regeneration via nucleoside diphosphate kinase.\n- The cost from UTP regeneration per residue is $1$ ATP equivalent.\n- The total cost per residue is $2$ ATP equivalents.\n- The fraction is:\n$$ \\text{Fraction} = \\frac{\\text{Cost from UTP Regeneration}}{\\text{Total Cost}} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThis fraction is independent of the total number of residues $N$.\n\nThe final answer is composed of the total ATP equivalents and this fraction.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\times 10^{6} & \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2567951"}, {"introduction": "The rate of glycogen synthesis is not constant; it is finely tuned to the cell's metabolic state.
