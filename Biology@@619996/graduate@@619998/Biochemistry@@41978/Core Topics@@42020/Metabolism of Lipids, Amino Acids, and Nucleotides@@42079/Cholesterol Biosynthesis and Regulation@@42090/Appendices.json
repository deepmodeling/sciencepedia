A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe initial task is to derive the rate equation for a competitive inhibitor within the Michaelis-Menten framework. Let the enzyme be denoted by `$E$`, the substrate (HMG-CoA) by `$S$`, the inhibitor by `$I$`, and the enzyme-substrate complex by `$ES$`. The relevant equilibria and reactions are:\n1.  Enzyme-substrate binding and catalysis:\n    $$E + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\stackrel{k_{cat}}{\\longrightarrow} E + P$$\n2.  Enzyme-inhibitor binding (competitive inhibition, inhibitor binds only to free enzyme):\n    $$E + I \\underset{k_{-i}}{\\stackrel{k_i}{\\rightleftharpoons}} EI$$\n\nThe inhibitor dissociation constant is given by $K_i = \\frac{[E][I]}{[EI]} = \\frac{k_{-i}}{k_i}$.\nThe Michaelis constant is defined as $K_m = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{cat}}{k_1}$.\nThe initial velocity of the reaction is given by $v_0 = k_{cat}[ES]$.\nThe total enzyme concentration, $[E]_t$, is conserved:\n$$[E]_t = [E] + [ES] + [EI]$$\nwhere $[E]$, $[ES]$, and $[EI]$ are the concentrations of free enzyme, enzyme-substrate complex, and enzyme-inhibitor complex, respectively.\n\nUnder the steady-state assumption, the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex is constant, $\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = 0$.\nThe rate of formation of `$ES$` is $k_1[E][S]$.\nThe rate of breakdown of `$ES$` is $k_{-1}[ES] + k_{cat}[ES] = (k_{-1} + k_{cat})[ES]$.\nAt steady state:\n$$k_1[E][S] = (k_{-1} + k_{cat})[ES]$$\n$$[E][S] = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{cat}}{k_1} [ES] = K_m [ES]$$\nThus, the concentration of free enzyme can be expressed in terms of $[ES]$:\n$$[E] = \\frac{K_m [ES]}{[S]}$$\nFrom the definition of the inhibition constant, we can express the concentration of the enzyme-inhibitor complex in terms of $[E]$:\n$$[EI] = \\frac{[E][I]}{K_i}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $[E]$:\n$$[EI] = \\frac{K_m [ES]}{[S]} \\frac{[I]}{K_i}$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $[E]$ and $[EI]$ into the total enzyme concentration equation:\n$$[E]_t = \\frac{K_m [ES]}{[S]} + [ES] + \\frac{K_m [ES]}{[S]} \\frac{[I]}{K_i}$$\nFactoring out $[ES]$:\n$$[E]_t = [ES] \\left( 1 + \\frac{K_m}{[S]} + \\frac{K_m [I]}{[S]K_i} \\right)$$\n$$[E]_t = [ES] \\left( 1 + \\frac{K_m}{[S]} \\left( 1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i} \\right) \\right)$$\nSolving for $[ES]$:\n$$[ES] = \\frac{[E]_t}{1 + \\frac{K_m}{[S]} \\left( 1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i} \\right)}$$\nThe initial velocity is $v_0 = k_{cat}[ES]$. Substituting the expression for $[ES]$:\n$$v_0 = \\frac{k_{cat}[E]_t}{1 + \\frac{K_m}{[S]} \\left( 1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i} \\right)}$$\nWe define the maximum velocity as $V_{max} = k_{cat}[E]_t$.\n$$v_0 = \\frac{V_{max}}{1 + \\frac{K_m}{[S]} \\left( 1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i} \\right)}$$\nTo obtain the standard Michaelis-Menten form, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $[S]$:\n$$v_0 = \\frac{V_{max}[S]}{[S] + K_m \\left( 1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i} \\right)}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the initial velocity. By comparing this to the standard Michaelis-Menten equation without inhibitor, $v_0 = \\frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m + [S]}$, we can identify the apparent Michaelis constant, $K_{m,app}$, in the presence of the competitive inhibitor. The term occupying the position of $K_m$ is:\n$$K_{m,app} = K_m \\left( 1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i} \\right)$$\nThis expression demonstrates that a competitive inhibitor increases the apparent Michaelis constant by a factor of $\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right)$, while $V_{max}$ remains unchanged.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $K_{m,app}$.\nThe given parameters are:\n- $K_{m} = K_{m,\\mathrm{HMG-CoA}} = 4.00\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $K_{i} = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n- $[I] = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n\nBefore substituting the values, we must ensure consistent units for $K_i$ and $[I]$.

Their ratio is thus $10.0$, which has three significant figures.\n\nNow, we calculate $K_{m,app}$:\n$$K_{m,app} = K_{m,\\mathrm{HMG-CoA}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i} \\right)$$\n$$K_{m,app} = (4.00\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) \\times (1 + 10.0)$$\nThe number `$1$` is an exact integer.

The concept of a sterol-sensing domain (SSD) in SCAP and its function in cholesterol-dependent regulation is a cornerstone of this field. A mutation that abolishes cholesterol binding to SCAP is a valid and commonly used hypothetical (and experimental) construct to probe the pathway's logic.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed.

It contains no logical contradictions, scientific inaccuracies, or undefined terms. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\nThe regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis is governed by the SREBP-$2$ pathway. We shall analyze the behavior of this pathway under the specified mutant condition.\n\n1.  **The Wild-Type Pathway (Reference):**\n    - At low $[Ch]_{\\mathrm{ER}}$, the SCAP–SREBP-$2$ complex is packaged into COPII vesicles, facilitated by the accessible MELADL motif on SCAP, and is transported from the ER to the Golgi apparatus.\n    - In the Golgi, SREBP-$2$ is sequentially cleaved by Site-$1$ protease (S$1$P) and Site-$2$ protease (S$2$P), releasing its N-terminal domain, a potent transcription factor designated nSREBP-$2$.\n    - nSREBP-$2$ translocates to the nucleus and activates target genes, leading to high transcriptional output, $E([Ch]_{\\mathrm{ER}}) \\to E_{\\max}$.\n    - At high $[Ch]_{\\mathrm{ER}}$, cholesterol binds to the sterol-sensing domain (SSD) of SCAP.\n    - This binding induces a conformational change in SCAP, promoting its high-affinity interaction with the ER-resident protein Insig.\n    - The resulting SCAP-Insig interaction has two effects: it masks the MELADL motif on SCAP, preventing COPII vesicle packaging, and it retains the entire SCAP–SREBP-$2$ complex in the ER.\n    - Consequently, SREBP-$2$ is not processed, nSREBP-$2$ is not generated, and target gene transcription is repressed, leading to low transcriptional output, $E([Ch]_{\\mathrm{ER}}) \\to E_{\\min}$.\n\n2.  **The Mutant Pathway (Problem Scenario):**\n    - The problem states that the mutation in SCAP's SSD **abolishes** its ability to bind cholesterol.\n    - The critical regulatory event in the wild-type pathway is the cholesterol-induced conformational change in SCAP that enables its binding to Insig.\n    - Since the mutant SCAP cannot bind cholesterol, it will never undergo this conformational change, regardless of how high $[Ch]_{\\mathrm{ER}}$ becomes.\n    - Lacking the cholesterol-dependent conformation, the mutant SCAP will be unable to bind to Insig.\n    - Without the formation of the SCAP-Insig retention complex, the MELADL motif on SCAP remains perpetually exposed.\n    - Therefore, the SCAP–SREBP-$2$ complex will be constitutively packaged into COPII vesicles and transported from the ER to the Golgi, irrespective of the cholesterol concentration $[Ch]_{\\mathrm{ER}}$.\n    - In the Golgi, SREBP-$2$ will undergo constitutive proteolytic processing, leading to a constant and maximal production of the active nSREBP-$2$ transcription factor.\n    - This will result in maximal, sustained activation of SREBP-$2$ target genes.\n    - The conclusion is that the transcriptional output, $E([Ch]_{\\mathrm{ER}})$, will be high and essentially constant, independent of the variable $[Ch]_{\\mathrm{ER}}$. Mathematically, $E([Ch]_{\\mathrm{ER}}) \\approx E_{\\max}$ for all values of $[Ch]_{\\mathrm{ER}}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $E([Ch]_{\\mathrm{ER}})$ decreases monotonically with increasing $[Ch]_{\\mathrm{ER}}$ (high at low $[Ch]_{\\mathrm{ER}}$, low at high $[Ch]_{\\mathrm{ER}}$), due to cholesterol-dependent ER retention of SCAP–SREBP-$2$ by Insig.**\nThis option describes the behavior of the *wild-type* system. It is incorrect because the problem specifies a mutant SCAP that cannot bind cholesterol. Without cholesterol binding to SCAP, there can be no cholesterol-dependent retention by Insig.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. $E([Ch]_{\\mathrm{ER}}) \\approx E_{\\max}$ and is essentially independent of $[Ch]_{\\mathrm{ER}}$, because loss of cholesterol sensing prevents Insig-mediated ER retention and allows constitutive ER-to-Golgi trafficking and proteolytic activation of SREBP-$2$.**\nThis option correctly identifies that the loss of cholesterol binding to SCAP prevents its interaction with Insig. This blockage of the retention mechanism leads to constitutive transport of SREBP-$2$ to the Golgi, constitutive processing, and therefore maximal, cholesterol-independent transcriptional output. This matches the derivation from first principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. $E([Ch]_{\\mathrm{ER}}) \\approx E_{\\min}$ and is essentially independent of $[Ch]_{\\mathrm{ER}}$, because SCAP cannot activate SREBP-$2$ without binding cholesterol.**\nThis reasoning is flawed. SCAP's role is to escort SREBP-$2$; its default state is to promote transport to the Golgi. Cholesterol binding does not \"activate\" this process; rather, it *inhibits* it by inducing retention. The absence of cholesterol binding leads to the a constitutively active transport process, not an inactive one.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $E([Ch]_{\\mathrm{ER}})$ is high at low $[Ch]_{\\mathrm{ER}}$, partially reduced at intermediate $[Ch]_{\\mathrm{ER}}$, and strongly repressed only at very high $[Ch]_{\\mathrm{ER}}$, reflecting a right-shifted sterol dose–response via residual Insig-dependent retention.**\nThis would imply that the mutation only reduced the affinity of SCAP for cholesterol, rather than abolishing binding. The problem states that binding is *abolished*. Furthermore, while other regulatory inputs exist in the full biological system (e.g., oxysterols acting on Insig), the problem explicitly excludes them (\"No exogenous oxysterols are added\") and focuses on the direct effect of the SCAP mutation in response to cholesterol alone. Based on the strict premises, no residual regulation should occur.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. $E([Ch]_{\\mathrm{ER}})$ increases with increasing $[Ch]_{\\mathrm{ER}}$, because loss of feedback makes SREBP-$2$ more responsive to sterols.**\nThis is fundamentally incorrect. The SREBP-$2$ pathway is a negative feedback loop; increasing cholesterol *decreases* transcriptional output in the wild-type system. An increasing function is the opposite of the known regulatory logic. The loss of feedback should make the system *unresponsive* to the feedback signal (cholesterol), not more responsive.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$"}, {"introduction": "To build a truly predictive understanding of metabolism, we must integrate its multiple layers of regulation into a cohesive mathematical framework.

The rate of transcription, $V_{\\mathrm{tx}}$, is:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{tx}} = k_{\\mathrm{tx,max}} \\frac{S^n}{K^n + S^n} $$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{tx,max}}$ is the maximal transcription rate, $n$ is the Hill coefficient, and $K$ is the half-activation constant.\nmRNA degradation is a first-order process with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{deg,m}}$. The rate of degradation is $k_{\\mathrm{deg,m}} m(t)$. The rate constant is related to the mRNA half-life, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}$, by $k_{\\mathrm{deg,m}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}}$.\nThe complete ordinary differential equation for $m(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dm(t)}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{tx,max}} \\frac{S^n}{K^n + S^n} - \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}} m(t) $$\nAt steady state, $\\frac{dm}{dt} = 0$. Let $m^\\ast$ be the steady-state mRNA amount.\n$$ 0 = k_{\\mathrm{tx,max}} \\frac{S^n}{K^n + S^n} - \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}} m^\\ast $$\nSolving for $m^\\ast$ yields the first required expression:\n$$ m^\\ast = \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}}{\\ln(2)} k_{\\mathrm{tx,max}} \\frac{S^n}{K^n + S^n} $$\n\nNext, we establish the dynamics for the HMGCR protein amount, $p(t)$. The rate of change, $\\frac{dp}{dt}$, is the difference between its synthesis (translation) and degradation.\nTranslation is a first-order process proportional to the mRNA amount $m(t)$ with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{tl}}$. The rate of translation is $k_{\\mathrm{tl}} m(t)$.\nProtein degradation is a first-order process with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{deg,p}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{p}}}$, where $\\tau_{\\mathrm{p}}$ is the protein half-life. The rate of degradation is $k_{\\mathrm{deg,p}} p(t)$.\nThe differential equation for $p(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dp(t)}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{tl}} m(t) - \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{p}}} p(t) $$\nAt steady state, $\\frac{dp}{dt} = 0$ and $m(t)=m^\\ast$. Let $p^\\ast$ be the steady-state protein amount.\n$$ 0 = k_{\\mathrm{tl}} m^\\ast - \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{p}}} p^\\ast $$\nSolving for $p^\\ast$ gives:\n$$ p^\\ast = \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{p}}}{\\ln(2)} k_{\\mathrm{tl}} m^\\ast $$\nSubstituting the previously derived expression for $m^\\ast$:\n$$ p^\\ast = \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{p}}}{\\ln(2)} k_{\\mathrm{tl}} \\left( \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}}{\\ln(2)} k_{\\mathrm{tx,max}} \\frac{S^n}{K^n + S^n} \\right) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tl}} k_{\\mathrm{tx,max}}}{(\\ln(2))^2} \\tau_{\\mathrm{p}} \\tau_{\\mathrm{m}} \\frac{S^n}{K^n + S^n} $$\n\nFinally, we determine the steady-state flux $J^\\ast$ through the HMGCR-catalyzed reaction. The rate is given by Michaelis–Menten kinetics, where the maximal velocity is proportional to the enzyme (protein) amount $p^\\ast$.\n$$ J^\\ast = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} p^\\ast \\frac{H}{K_M + H} $$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ is the catalytic rate constant, $H$ is the substrate concentration, and $K_M$ is the Michaelis constant.\nSubstituting the expression for $p^\\ast$:\n$$ J^\\ast = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tl}} k_{\\mathrm{tx,max}}}{(\\ln(2))^2} \\tau_{\\mathrm{p}} \\tau_{\\mathrm{m}} \\frac{S^n}{K^n + S^n} \\right) \\left( \\frac{H}{K_M + H} \\right) $$\nThis completes the derivation of the three steady-state quantities.\n\n**2. Derivation of Analytical Sensitivity**\n\nThe local log-sensitivity of the steady-state flux $J^\\ast$ with respect to the mRNA half-life $\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is defined as:\n$$ S_{J,\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln J^\\ast}{\\partial \\ln \\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}} $$\nTo compute this, we first express $J^\\ast$ as a function of $\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}$. Let us group all terms not dependent on $\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}$ into a single constant $\\Phi$:\n$$ \\Phi = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} k_{\\mathrm{tl}} k_{\\mathrm{tx,max}} \\tau_{\\mathrm{p}}}{(\\ln(2))^2} \\left( \\frac{S^n}{K^n + S^n} \\right) \\left( \\frac{H}{K_M + H} \\right) $$\nWith this, the expression for $J^\\ast$ simplifies to a direct proportionality:\n$$ J^\\ast = \\Phi \\cdot \\tau_{\\mathrm{m}} $$\nTo find the sensitivity, we take the natural logarithm of $J^\\ast$:\n$$ \\ln J^\\ast = \\ln(\\Phi \\cdot \\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}) = \\ln(\\Phi) + \\ln(\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}) $$\nNow, we differentiate this expression with respect to $\\ln(\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}})$. Since $\\Phi$ is a constant with respect to $\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}$, its logarithm $\\ln(\\Phi)$ is also a constant.\n$$ S_{J,\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln \\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}} (\\ln(\\Phi) + \\ln(\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}})) = \\frac{\\partial (\\ln \\Phi)}{\\partial \\ln \\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}} + \\frac{\\partial (\\ln \\tau_{\\mathrm{m}})}{\\partial \\ln \\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}} $$\nThe derivative of a constant is zero, and the derivative of a variable with respect to itself is one.\n$$ S_{J,\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}} = 0 + 1 = 1 $$\nThe analytical sensitivity is exactly $1$, a result of the direct, linear dependence of $J^\\ast$ on $\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}$ in this model. This signifies that a $1\\%$ change in mRNA half-life will result in a $1\\%$ change in the steady-state flux, regardless of the specific values of the other system parameters.\n\n**3. Finite-Difference Sensitivity Estimate**\n\nThe problem also mandates a numerical estimation of this sensitivity using a symmetric finite-difference formula:\n$$ S_{J,\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}}^{\\mathrm{FD}} \\approx \\frac{\\ln J^\\ast\\!\\left(\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}(1+\\epsilon)\\right) - \\ln J^\\ast\\!\\left(\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}(1-\\epsilon)\\right)}{\\ln\\!\\left(\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}(1+\\epsilon)\\right) - \\ln\\!\\left(\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}(1-\\epsilon)\\right)} $$\nGiven our finding that $J^\\ast = \\Phi \\cdot \\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}$, we can substitute this into the numerator:\n$$ \\ln J^\\ast(\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}(1+\\epsilon)) - \\ln J^\\ast(\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}(1-\\epsilon)) = \\ln(\\Phi \\cdot \\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}(1+\\epsilon)) - \\ln(\\Phi \\cdot \\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}(1-\\epsilon)) $$\n$$ = (\\ln(\\Phi) + \\ln(\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}) + \\ln(1+\\epsilon)) - (\\ln(\\Phi) + \\ln(\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}) + \\ln(1-\\epsilon)) = \\ln(1+\\epsilon) - \\ln(1-\\epsilon) $$\nThe denominator simplifies similarly:\n$$ \\ln(\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}(1+\\epsilon)) - \\ln(\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}(1-\\epsilon)) = (\\ln(\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}) + \\ln(1+\\epsilon)) - (\\ln(\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}) + \\ln(1-\\epsilon)) = \\ln(1+\\epsilon) - \\ln(1-\\epsilon) $$\nThus, for this specific model, the numerator and denominator are identical. Their ratio is exactly $1$. The finite-difference estimate will equal the analytical result, with any deviation being attributable solely to floating-point representation error. This serves as a strong internal consistency check for the derivations.
