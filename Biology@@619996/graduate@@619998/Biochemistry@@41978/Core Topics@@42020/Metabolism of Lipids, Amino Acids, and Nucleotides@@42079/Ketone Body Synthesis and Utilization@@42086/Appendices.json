It is scientifically grounded in established principles of mitochondrial metabolism, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its language. It poses a standard biochemical stoichiometry problem that requires careful accounting based on a specific metabolic pathway. We will proceed with a solution.\n\nThe task is to calculate the total yield of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) equivalents from the complete oxidation of one molecule of D-3-hydroxybutyrate to carbon dioxide ($\\mathrm{CO_2}$) in cardiac muscle, under the specific conditions provided. The calculation is organized by following the metabolic sequence step by step.\n\nFirst, the oxidation of D-3-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate. This reaction is catalyzed by D-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase. According to the problem, this step produces one molecule of mitochondrial reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH).\n$$ \\text{D-3-hydroxybutyrate} \\rightarrow \\text{Acetoacetate} $$\nYield from this step: $+1$ NADH.\n\nSecond, the activation of acetoacetate to acetoacetyl-coenzyme A (acetoacetyl-CoA).

The reaction transfers a CoA group from succinyl-CoA to acetoacetate.\n$$ \\text{Acetoacetate} + \\text{Succinyl-CoA} \\rightarrow \\text{Acetoacetyl-CoA} + \\text{Succinate} $$\nThe crucial point, as stated, is that this reaction bypasses the succinyl-CoA synthetase step of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

By using the OXCT1-catalyzed pathway, the cell forfeits this GTP. Therefore, the activation of one molecule of acetoacetate imposes a metabolic cost equivalent to the loss of one GTP.\nCost of this step: $-1$ GTP.\n\nThird, the cleavage of acetoacetyl-CoA. The enzyme thiolase cleaves one molecule of acetoacetyl-CoA into two molecules of acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA).\n$$ \\text{Acetoacetyl-CoA} + \\text{CoA} \\rightarrow 2 \\text{ Acetyl-CoA} $$\nThis step does not produce or consume any of the energy-carrying molecules specified (NADH, FADH$_2$, or GTP).\n\nFourth, the complete oxidation of the two molecules of acetyl-CoA in the TCA cycle. The problem states that the complete oxidation of one molecule of acetyl-CoA yields exactly $3$ NADH, $1$ reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH$_2$), and $1$ GTP.

This condition is characteristic of a state where the production of reducing equivalents (NADH) by catabolic pathways vastly outpaces their consumption by the electron transport chain (ETC).\n\n- **Hepatic mitochondria during fasting:** During fasting, the liver performs extensive fatty acid $\\beta$-oxidation to produce acetyl-CoA for ketogenesis and to generate ATP and reducing equivalents (NADH) for gluconeogenesis. The high rate of fatty acid oxidation leads to a massive production of NADH. Since the rate of the ETC is coupled to cellular ATP demand, which might not be maximal, the NADH accumulates, leading to a very high, or reduced, $[\\mathrm{NADH}]/[\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}]$ ratio. This high ratio is also what drives the reduction of acetoacetate to $\\beta$-hydroxybutyrate.\n\n- **Cardiac mitochondria under oxidative workload:** The heart muscle has a very high and continuous demand for ATP to sustain contraction. While it also uses fatty acids as a primary fuel source, the high workload means the rate of oxidative phosphorylation is extremely high. The ETC operates at a high capacity to regenerate NAD$^+$ from NADH, thus preventing NADH from accumulating to very high levels. Consequently, the $[\\mathrm{NADH}]/[\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}]$ ratio in working cardiac muscle, while still reflecting an active metabolism, is expected to be significantly lower than in the fasting liver.\n\nTherefore, the calculated value of $[\\mathrm{NADH}]/[\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}] \\approx 28$ is far more consistent with the metabolic state of **hepatic mitochondria during fasting**, where a highly reduced environment is maintained by vigorous fatty acid oxidation in service of ketogenesis.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{28} $$", "id": "2573541"}, {"introduction": "While metabolically useful, the overproduction of ketone bodies can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening condition.

The plasma anion gap (AG) is defined as the difference between the concentrations of routinely measured cations and anions, and is used as a surrogate for the net concentration of unmeasured anions. Consider the accumulation of the two principal ketone bodies, acetoacetate and D-3-hydroxybutyrate, during a state of increased hepatic ketogenesis. Treat each ketone body as a monoprotic weak acid that can dissociate into a proton and its conjugate base.

First, a qualitative explanation from first principles is required. Second, a quantitative calculation of the change in the anion gap ($\\Delta AG$) under specified conditions. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution.\n\nFirst, we address the qualitative reasoning. The principle of electroneutrality dictates that the total concentration of positive charges (cations) in plasma must equal the total concentration of negative charges (anions). We can express this as:\n$$\n\\sum [\\text{Cations}] = \\sum [\\text{Anions}]\n$$\nThese ions can be divided into those that are routinely measured and those that are unmeasured. Let $C_M$ and $A_M$ be the sets of measured cations and anions, respectively, and $C_U$ and $A_U$ be the unmeasured ones. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in C_M} [C_i] + \\sum_{j \\in C_U} [C_j] = \\sum_{k \\in A_M} [A_k] + \\sum_{l \\in A_U} [A_l]\n$$\nThe plasma anion gap ($AG$) is defined as the difference between the concentrations of measured cations and measured anions:\n$$\nAG = \\sum_{i \\in C_M} [C_i] - \\sum_{k \\in A_M} [A_k]\n$$\nBy rearranging the electroneutrality equation, we see that the anion gap is a surrogate for the net concentration of unmeasured anions:\n$$\nAG = \\sum_{l \\in A_U} [A_l] - \\sum_{j \\in C_U} [C_j]\n$$\nThe primary unmeasured anions include albumin, phosphate, and sulfate, while unmeasured cations include calcium and magnesium.\n\nDuring ketogenesis, the liver produces acetoacetic acid ($\\text{HAcAc}$) and D-3-hydroxybutyric acid ($\\text{H}\\beta\\text{HB}$). These are weak acids that are released into the bloodstream. In the plasma, at a physiological $pH$ of approximately $7.4$, these acids dissociate into a proton ($H^+$) and their respective conjugate bases, acetoacetate ($\\text{AcAc}^-$) and D-3-hydroxybutyrate ($\\beta\\text{HB}^-$):\n$$\n\\text{HAcAc} \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + \\text{AcAc}^-\n$$\n$$\n\\text{H}\\beta\\text{HB} \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + \\beta\\text{HB}^-\n$$\nThis process has two major consequences. First, the release of protons ($H^+$) into the blood constitutes an acid load. This acid is buffered primarily by the bicarbonate system ($HCO_3^-$), leading to a decrease in the plasma $[HCO_3^-]$ concentration and a drop in $pH$. This is metabolic acidosis. Second, the conjugate bases, $\\text{AcAc}^-$ and $\\beta\\text{HB}^-$, are anions that are not routinely measured. Their accumulation increases the total concentration of unmeasured anions, $\\sum [A_l]$. According to the relationship $AG = \\sum [A_l] - \\sum [C_j]$, this increase in unmeasured anions directly increases the anion gap. The decrease in $[HCO_3^-]$, a measured anion, also contributes to the calculated increase in $AG$. Thus, the accumulation of ketone bodies produces a high anion gap metabolic acidosis.\n\nNext, we proceed to the quantitative derivation and calculation. The change in the anion gap, $\\Delta AG$, is the final anion gap ($AG_f$) minus the initial anion gap ($AG_0$). A standard clinical definition of the anion gap uses sodium ($Na^+$) as the primary measured cation and chloride ($Cl^-$) and bicarbonate ($HCO_3^-$) as the measured anions:\n$$\nAG = [\\text{Na}^+] - ([\\text{Cl}^-] + [\\text{HCO}_3^-])\n$$\nThe change in the anion gap is thus:\n$$\n\\Delta AG = AG_f - AG_0 = \\left( [\\text{Na}^+]_f - ([\\text{Cl}^-]_f + [\\text{HCO}_3^-]_f) \\right) - \\left( [\\text{Na}^+]_0 - ([\\text{Cl}^-]_0 + [\\text{HCO}_3^-]_0) \\right)\n$$\nThe problem states the assumption that the concentrations of routinely measured cations ($[\\text{Na}^+]$) and chloride ($[\\text{Cl}^-]$) remain constant. Therefore, $[\\text{Na}^+]_f = [\\text{Na}^+]_0$ and $[\\text{Cl}^-]_f = [\\text{Cl}^-]_0$. The expression for $\\Delta AG$ simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Delta AG = -[\\text{HCO}_3^-]_f + [\\text{HCO}_3^-]_0 = - ([\\text{HCO}_3^-]_f - [\\text{HCO}_3^-]_0) = -\\Delta[\\text{HCO}_3^-]\n$$\nThis shows that the increase in the anion gap is equal to the decrease in the bicarbonate concentration. The decrease in bicarbonate is caused by the buffering of protons released from the dissociation of ketone acids. For every mole of $H^+$ buffered by $HCO_3^-$, one mole of $HCO_3^-$ is consumed. The total concentration of protons released is equal to the total concentration of the formed conjugate bases, $[\\text{AcAc}^-]$ and $[\\beta\\text{HB}^-]$. Assuming all of this acid load is buffered by bicarbonate, the change in bicarbonate is:\n$$\n\\Delta[\\text{HCO}_3^-] = - ([\\text{AcAc}^-] + [\\beta\\text{HB}^-])\n$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $\\Delta AG$:\n$$\n\\Delta AG = - \\Delta[\\text{HCO}_3^-] = - \\left( - ([\\text{AcAc}^-] + [\\beta\\text{HB}^-]) \\right) = [\\text{AcAc}^-] + [\\beta\\text{HB}^-]\n$$\nThis is the derived expression: the increase in the anion gap is equal to the sum of the concentrations of the dissociated ketone bodies.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically. The concentration of a dissociated weak acid ($[A^-]$) can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The fraction of the acid in its dissociated form, $\\alpha = \\frac{[A^-]}{[HA] + [A^-]}$, is given by:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{10^{pH - pK_a}}{1 + 10^{pH - pK_a}}\n$$\nThe concentration of the conjugate base is $[A^-] = \\alpha \\times [A]_{\\text{total}}$.\n\nThe given conditions are:\nTotal ketone body concentration, $[\\text{Ketone}]_{\\text{total}} = 25.0 \\text{ mmol/L}$.\nMolar ratio of D-3-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate is $3:1$.\nThis implies:\n$$\n[\\text{H}\\beta\\text{HB}]_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 25.0 \\text{ mmol/L} = 18.75 \\text{ mmol/L}\n$$\n$$\n[\\text{HAcAc}]_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 25.0 \\text{ mmol/L} = 6.25 \\text{ mmol/L}\n$$\nThe other conditions are $pH = 7.40$, $pK_{a, \\text{HAcAc}} = 3.58$, and $pK_{a, \\text{H}\\beta\\text{HB}} = 4.41$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of acetoacetate, $[\\text{AcAc}^-]$:\n$$\npH - pK_{a, \\text{HAcAc}} = 7.40 - 3.58 = 3.82\n$$\n$$\n[\\text{AcAc}^-] = [\\text{HAcAc}]_{\\text{total}} \\times \\frac{10^{3.82}}{1 + 10^{3.82}} = 6.25 \\times \\frac{6606.93}{1 + 6606.93} = 6.25 \\times 0.9998486 = 6.24905 \\text{ mmol/L}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the concentration of D-3-hydroxybutyrate, $[\\beta\\text{HB}^-]$:\n$$\npH - pK_{a, \\text{H}\\beta\\text{HB}} = 7.40 - 4.41 = 2.99\n$$\n$$\n[\\beta\\text{HB}^-] = [\\text{H}\\beta\\text{HB}]_{\\text{total}} \\times \\frac{10^{2.99}}{1 + 10^{2.99}} = 18.75 \\times \\frac{977.237}{1 + 977.237} = 18.75 \\times 0.9989778 = 18.73083 \\text{ mmol/L}\n$$\nThe total increase in the anion gap is the sum of these concentrations:\n$$\n\\Delta AG = [\\text{AcAc}^-] + [\\beta\\text{HB}^-] = 6.24905 \\text{ mmol/L} + 18.73083 \\text{ mmol/L} = 24.97988 \\text{ mmol/L}\n$$\nRounding the final result to three significant figures, we get $25.0 \\text{ mmol/L}$.\nThe reason the result is very close to the total ketone concentration of $25.0 \\text{ mmol/L}$ is that the plasma $pH$ of $7.40$ is significantly higher than the $pK_a$ values of both acids ($3.58$ and $4.41$), causing them to be almost completely dissociated.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{25.0}\n$$", "id": "2573474"}]}
