The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. We shall proceed with a systematic accounting for each task.\n\nThe synthesis of one molecule of glucose, a 6-carbon sugar, requires two molecules of a 3-carbon precursor such as pyruvate or lactate. The pathway involves several steps that are common to both tasks, and these steps must be accounted for stoichiometrically.

The costs from pyruvate to glucose remain a consumption of 4 ATP, 2 GTP, and 2 NADH, with a production of 6 $P_i$. To find the net balance for Task B, we must combine the results of the LDH reaction with the costs for the rest of the pathway.\n\n**Summary for Task B (Lactate source):**\n- Net ATP consumed ($a_\\ell$): The LDH reaction does not involve ATP.

You may use water labeled with oxygen-18 ($\\mathrm{H}_{2}^{18}\\mathrm{O}$) and quantify labeled inorganic phosphate (Pi) released to the extracellular medium by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS).\n- Quantify the net glycolytic flux across the PFK-1 step by enforcing anaerobic conditions such that pyruvate is reduced to lactate, and measure lactate appearance in the extracellular medium by enzymatic assay.

It provides a self-contained set of definitions, constraints, and experimental data sufficient for a unique and meaningful solution. It is based on established principles of metabolic flux analysis using isotopic tracers. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nFirst, the minimal experimental setup, as per the design constraints, is outlined:\n1.  Primary mouse hepatocytes are isolated and cultured under conditions that maintain viability and metabolic steady state.\n2.  The culture medium is replaced with one containing a known atom fraction of heavy-oxygen water, $f_{w} = 0.20$ of $\\mathrm{H}_{2}^{18}\\mathrm{O}$.\n3.  Anaerobic conditions are imposed, for example by incubation in an anaerobic chamber or by using mitochondrial inhibitors like rotenone or antimycin A, to ensure that glucose-derived pyruvate is quantitatively converted to lactate.\n4.  Substrate (e.g., glucose, fructose) is provided at a constant concentration to maintain steady-state fluxes. Other significant sources of extracellular inorganic phosphate ($\\mathrm{Pi}$) and lactate are suppressed or confirmed to be negligible.\n5.  At steady state, the extracellular medium is sampled over time to measure two rates:\n    *   The rate of appearance of singly $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$-labeled inorganic phosphate ($P^{18}O_3O^{2-}$), $r_{\\ell}$, using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS).\n    *   The rate of appearance of lactate, $v_{\\mathrm{lac}}$, using a standard enzymatic assay (e.g., lactate dehydrogenase-based).\n6.  Rates are normalized to total cellular protein content, yielding units of $\\mathrm{nmol}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$ protein.\n\nWe now proceed to the calculation. Let $v_{PFK-1}$ be the forward flux through phosphofructokinase-1 and $v_{FBPase-1}$ be the reverse flux through fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase-1. Both fluxes are expressed in units of $\\mathrm{nmol}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$ protein.\n\nThe PFK-1/FBPase-1 futile cycle consists of the simultaneous operation of both reactions:\n$$\n\\text{Fructose-6-phosphate} + \\mathrm{ATP} \\xrightarrow{v_{PFK-1}} \\text{Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate} + \\mathrm{ADP}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate} + \\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O} \\xrightarrow{v_{FBPase-1}} \\text{Fructose-6-phosphate} + \\mathrm{Pi}\n$$\nThe net reaction for one full turn of this cycle is the hydrolysis of one molecule of ATP:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ATP} + \\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O} \\to \\mathrm{ADP} + \\mathrm{Pi}\n$$\nThe rate of ATP consumption due *solely* to this futile cycling, denoted $v_{ATP,cycle}$, is therefore equivalent to the rate at which the cycle turns over. The rate of the cycle is determined by the reverse flux, $v_{FBPase-1}$, as this represents the portion of the forward flux that is immediately undone. Thus, we have the direct relationship:\n$$\nv_{ATP,cycle} = v_{FBPase-1}\n$$\nOur primary task is to determine $v_{FBPase-1}$ from the provided experimental data.\n\nThe FBPase-1 reaction incorporates an oxygen atom from water into the released inorganic phosphate. The problem states that the probability of incorporating an $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$ atom into a Pi molecule is equal to the atom fraction of $\\mathrm{H}_{2}^{18}\\mathrm{O}$ in the medium, $f_{w}$. The total rate of Pi production from FBPase-1 is $v_{FBPase-1}$. The rate of appearance of singly $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$-labeled Pi, $r_{\\ell}$, is therefore the total flux multiplied by the probability of labeling:\n$$\nr_{\\ell} = v_{FBPase-1} \\times f_{w}\n$$\nWe can solve this for $v_{FBPase-1}$:\n$$\nv_{FBPase-1} = \\frac{r_{\\ell}}{f_{w}}\n$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n$r_{\\ell} = 2.40 \\, \\mathrm{nmol}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$ protein\n$f_{w} = 0.20$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$\nv_{FBPase-1} = \\frac{2.40}{0.20} \\, \\mathrm{nmol}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mg}^{-1} \\text{protein} = 12 \\, \\mathrm{nmol}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mg}^{-1} \\text{protein}\n$$\nThe number of significant figures in the result of a division is limited by the measurement with the fewest significant figures. The value $r_{\\ell} = 2.40$ has three significant figures. The value $f_{w} = 0.20$ has two significant figures. Therefore, the result must be reported with two significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $12$, which correctly has two significant figures.\n\nSince the rate of ATP consumption due to the futile cycle is equal to the reverse flux, $v_{ATP,cycle} = v_{FBPase-1}$, the final answer is $12 \\, \\mathrm{nmol}\\,\\mathrm{ATP}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$ protein.\n\nFor completeness, we analyze the lactate data. The net glycolytic flux, $v_{net}$, across this step is the difference between the forward and reverse fluxes: $v_{net} = v_{PFK-1} - v_{FBPase-1}$. Under anaerobic conditions, each mole of hexose that passes this step nets two moles of lactate. Thus, the rate of lactate appearance, $v_{\\mathrm{lac}}$, is related to the net flux by:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{lac}} = 2 \\times v_{net}\n$$\nGiven $v_{\\mathrm{lac}} = 16.0 \\, \\mathrm{nmol}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$ protein:\n$$\nv_{net} = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{lac}}}{2} = \\frac{16.0}{2} = 8.0 \\, \\mathrm{nmol}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mg}^{-1} \\text{protein}\n$$\nThis allows the calculation of the total forward flux, $v_{PFK-1}$:\n$$\nv_{PFK-1} = v_{net} + v_{FBPase-1} = 8.0 + 12 = 20 \\, \\mathrm{nmol}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mg}^{-1} \\text{protein}\n$$\n(Here, adding $8.0$ and $12$, the result should be reported to the last common significant decimal place, which is the ones place, resulting in $20$.)\nThis confirms that the system maintains a net glycolytic flux ($v_{net} = 8.0$) while a substantial portion of the forward PFK-1 flux ($12$ out of $20$, or $60\\%$) is engaged in futile cycling. However, this calculation is not necessary to determine the ATP consumption of the cycle itself, which is determined solely by the reverse flux $v_{FBPase-1}$.\nThe rate of ATP consumption attributed solely to the futile cycle is $v_{FBPase-1}$.\n$$\nv_{ATP,cycle} = 12 \\, \\mathrm{nmol}\\,\\mathrm{ATP}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mg}^{-1} \\text{protein}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12}$$", "id": "2567188"}]}
