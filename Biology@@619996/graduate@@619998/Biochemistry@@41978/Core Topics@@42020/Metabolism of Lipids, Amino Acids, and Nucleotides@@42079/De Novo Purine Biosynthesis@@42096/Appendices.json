It is based on established principles of biochemistry, specifically the pathways of *de novo* purine biosynthesis and salvage. All necessary data and conditions for a unique solution are provided.

This pool is a mixture of two subpopulations: IMP molecules synthesized *de novo* and IMP molecules produced via the salvage pathway.\n\nLet $E[\\text{N}_{15}]$ represent the expected number of $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ atoms in a randomly selected IMP molecule from the total pool. The total pool is composed of a fraction $s$ of molecules from the salvage pathway and a fraction $1-s$ of molecules from the *de novo* pathway. The law of total expectation dictates that the overall expected value is the weighted average of the expected values for each subpopulation:\n$$E[\\text{N}_{15}] = (1-s) \\cdot E[\\text{N}_{15, \\text{de novo}}] + s \\cdot E[\\text{N}_{15, \\text{salvage}}]$$\nwhere $E[\\text{N}_{15, \\text{de novo}}]$ is the expected number of $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ atoms in an IMP molecule synthesized *de novo*, and $E[\\text{N}_{15, \\text{salvage}}]$ is the expected number for an IMP molecule from the salvage pathway.\n\nFirst, we analyze the salvage pathway. IMP produced by salvage is formed from exogenous, unlabeled hypoxanthine. The salvage reaction, catalyzed by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), attaches the existing purine ring of hypoxanthine to a phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) molecule. No new nitrogen atoms are incorporated into the purine ring during this process. Since the starting hypoxanthine is unlabeled, any IMP molecule produced via this pathway will contain zero $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ atoms. Therefore, the expected number of labels is zero:\n$$E[\\text{N}_{15, \\text{salvage}}] = 0$$\n\nNext, we analyze the *de novo* synthesis pathway. The purine ring of IMP contains four nitrogen atoms, labeled $N1$, $N3$, $N7$, and $N9$. According to the provided information:\n- $N1$ is derived from the $\\alpha$-amino nitrogen of aspartate.\n- $N3$ is derived from the amide nitrogen of glutamine.\n- $N7$ is derived from glycine.\n- $N9$ is derived from the amide nitrogen of glutamine.\n\nLet $X_i$ be an indicator random variable such that $X_i = 1$ if the nitrogen at position $i$ is a $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ isotope, and $X_i = 0$ otherwise. The total number of $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ atoms in a single *de novo* IMP molecule is the sum of these indicator variables: $N_{15, \\text{de novo}} = X_1 + X_3 + X_7 + X_9$.\n\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected number of labels in a *de novo* molecule is the sum of the expected values of these indicator variables:\n$$E[\\text{N}_{15, \\text{de novo}}] = E[X_1] + E[X_3] + E[X_7] + E[X_9]$$\nThe expected value of an indicator variable is the probability of the event it represents. The problem states that incorporation events are independent and sample from homogeneous precursor pools.\n- The probability that $N1$ is labeled is equal to the fractional enrichment of its precursor, the aspartate $\\alpha$-amino nitrogen pool, which is $f_A$. Thus, $E[X_1] = f_A$.\n- The probability that $N3$ is labeled is equal to the fractional enrichment of its precursor, the glutamine amide nitrogen pool, which is $f_Q$. Thus, $E[X_3] = f_Q$.\n- The precursor for $N7$, glycine, is stated to be unlabeled. Therefore, the probability that $N7$ is labeled is $0$. Thus, $E[X_7] = 0$.\n- The probability that $N9$ is labeled is also determined by the glutamine amide nitrogen pool, so it is $f_Q$. Thus, $E[X_9] = f_Q$.\n\nSumming these expected values gives the expected number of labels for the *de novo* subpopulation:\n$$E[\\text{N}_{15, \\text{de novo}}] = f_A + f_Q + 0 + f_Q = f_A + 2f_Q$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expected values for both subpopulations back into the original weighted average equation:\n$$E[\\text{N}_{15}] = (1-s) \\cdot (f_A + 2f_Q) + s \\cdot (0)$$\n$$E[\\text{N}_{15}] = (1-s)(f_A + 2f_Q)$$\n\nThis is the final analytical expression for the expected mean number of $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ atoms per IMP molecule. We now substitute the given numerical values: $f_Q = 0.79$, $f_A = 0.43$, and $s = 0.31$.\nFirst, calculate the term for the *de novo* contribution:\n$$f_A + 2f_Q = 0.43 + 2(0.79) = 0.43 + 1.58 = 2.01$$\nNext, calculate the fraction of IMP from *de novo* synthesis:\n$$1 - s = 1 - 0.31 = 0.69$$\nFinally, compute the total expected value:\n$$E[\\text{N}_{15}] = (0.69) \\cdot (2.01) = 1.3869$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.
