The substrates (palmitoleate, $\\alpha$-linolenate, linoleate) and enzymes ($\\Delta 6$ and $\\Delta 5$ desaturases) are canonical examples in this field. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary information provided to derive a unique chemical structure at each step. The language is objective and precise. The problem is free of scientific inaccuracies, contradictions, and ambiguities. It represents a standard, non-trivial exercise in biochemistry.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe core principles for solving this problem are as follows:\n1.  **Nomenclature Conversion**: For a fatty acid with $N$ carbons and a double bond at position $\\Delta k$, the corresponding $\\omega$ position is given by $\\omega = N - k$. For PUFAs, the $\\omega$ designation is determined by the position of the double bond closest to the methyl terminus.\n2.  **Elongation**: The addition of $2$ carbons occurs at the carboxyl terminus ($C_1$). This increases the total carbon count $N$ by $2$. Consequently, the numerical position of all existing double bonds, when counted from the carboxyl end ($\\Delta$-system), increases by $2$. Elongation does not alter the distance of any double bond from the methyl terminus, so the $\\omega$ designation remains unchanged.\n3.  **Desaturation**: A desaturase enzyme, such as $\\Delta k$ desaturase, introduces a new double bond between carbon $k$ and carbon $k+1$. This increases the number of double bonds by one but does not change the total carbon count $N$. The introduction of a new double bond at a position closer to the carboxyl group than any existing double bond does not change the $\\omega$ designation.\n\nWe will now analyze each segment based on these principles.\n\n**Segment 1: MUFA conversion and elongation**\n- **Initial Substrate**: Palmitoleate, $16:1 \\Delta 9$. This is a fatty acid with $N=16$ carbons and one double bond at position $\\Delta 9$.\n- **$\\Delta \\rightarrow \\omega$ Conversion**: The position from the methyl end is $\\omega = N - k = 16 - 9 = 7$. Thus, $16:1 \\Delta 9$ is correctly denoted as $16:1 \\omega-7$ or $16:1 n-7$.\n- **Elongation**: One round of elongation adds $2$ carbons.\n  - The new total carbon count is $N' = 16 + 2 = 18$.\n  - The original double bond was at $\\Delta 9$. After adding $2$ carbons at the carboxyl end, this bond is now at position $\\Delta(9+2) = \\Delta 11$.\n  - The product is $18:1 \\Delta 11$.\n  - The $\\omega$ designation does not change during elongation. The product remains an $\\omega-7$ fatty acid. We can verify this: for the product, $N'=18$ and $k'=11$, so $\\omega = N' - k' = 18 - 11 = 7$.\n- **Conclusion for Segment 1**: The initial conversion is $16:1 \\Delta 9 \\rightarrow 16:1 \\omega-7$. The product after elongation is $18:1 \\Delta 11$ ($18:1 \\omega-7$).\n\n**Segment 2: PUFA $\\omega \\rightarrow \\Delta$ conversion and sequential reactions**\n- **Initial Substrate**: A PUFA denoted as $18:3 \\omega-3$ ($\\alpha$-linolenic acid). This is a fatty acid with $N=18$ carbons, $3$ double bonds, and belongs to the $\\omega-3$ family.\n- **$\\omega \\rightarrow \\Delta$ Conversion**: The double bond closest to the methyl end is at position $3$. In $\\Delta$ notation, this is $\\Delta(18-3) = \\Delta 15$. Since the double bonds are methylene-interrupted, they are separated by $3$ carbons. The positions are therefore $\\Delta 15$, $\\Delta(15-3)=\\Delta 12$, and $\\Delta(12-3)=\\Delta 9$. So, $18:3 \\omega-3$ is $18:3 \\Delta 9,12,15$.\n- **Reaction Sequence**:\n  1. **$\\Delta 6$ Desaturation**: Acting on $18:3 \\Delta 9,12,15$, a new double bond is introduced at $\\Delta 6$.\n     - Product: $18:4 \\Delta 6,9,12,15$. This product is still an $\\omega-3$ fatty acid because the last double bond position ($\\Delta 15$) and chain length ($18$) are unchanged.\n  2. **Elongation**: Acting on $18:4 \\Delta 6,9,12,15$, $2$ carbons are added.\n     - New chain length: $N' = 18 + 2 = 20$.\n     - New $\\Delta$ positions: $\\Delta(6+2, 9+2, 12+2, 15+2) = \\Delta(8, 11, 14, 17)$.\n     - Product: $20:4 \\Delta 8,11,14,17$. This product remains an $\\omega-3$ fatty acid.\n  3. **$\\Delta 5$ Desaturation**: Acting on $20:4 \\Delta 8,11,14,17$, a new double bond is introduced at $\\Delta 5$.\n     - Product: $20:5 \\Delta 5,8,11,14,17$.

The final product is $20:5 \\omega-3$.\n- **Conclusion for Segment 2**: The initial conversion is $18:3 \\omega-3 \\rightarrow 18:3 \\Delta 9,12,15$. The final product of the sequence is $20:5 \\Delta 5,8,11,14,17$ ($20:5 \\omega-3$).\n\n**Segment 3: PUFA $\\omega \\rightarrow \\Delta$ conversion and arachidonate pathway**\n- **Initial Substrate**: Linoleate, $18:2 \\omega-6$. This is a fatty acid with $N=18$ carbons, $2$ double bonds, and belongs to the $\\omega-6$ family.\n- **$\\omega \\rightarrow \\Delta$ Conversion**: The last double bond is at $\\Delta(18-6)=\\Delta 12$. The other methylene-interrupted bond is at $\\Delta(12-3)=\\Delta 9$. So, $18:2 \\omega-6$ is $18:2 \\Delta 9,12$.\n- **Reaction Sequence**:\n  1. **$\\Delta 6$ Desaturation**: Acting on $18:2 \\Delta 9,12$, a new double bond is introduced at $\\Delta 6$.\n     - Product: $18:3 \\Delta 6,9,12$. This is an $\\omega-6$ fatty acid ($\\omega = 18-12=6$).\n  2. **Elongation**: Acting on $18:3 \\Delta 6,9,12$, $2$ carbons are added.\n     - New chain length: $N' = 18 + 2 = 20$.\n     - New $\\Delta$ positions: $\\Delta(6+2, 9+2, 12+2) = \\Delta(8, 11, 14)$.\n     - Product: $20:3 \\Delta 8,11,14$. This product remains an $\\omega-6$ fatty acid.\n  3. **$\\Delta 5$ Desaturation**: Acting on $20:3 \\Delta 8,11,14$, a new double bond is introduced at $\\Delta 5$.\n     - Product: $20:4 \\Delta 5,8,11,14$. This final product is arachidonic acid (AA).\n     - The $\\omega$ designation is determined by the last double bond: $\\omega = N' - k'_{\\text{last}} = 20 - 14 = 6$. The final product is $20:4 \\omega-6$.\n- **Conclusion for Segment 3**: The initial conversion is $18:2 \\omega-6 \\rightarrow 18:2 \\Delta 9,12$. The final product of the sequence is $20:4 \\Delta 5,8,11,14$ ($20:4 \\omega-6$).\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n- **Option A**:\n  - Segment 1: States $16:1 \\Delta 9$ is $n-7$; after elongation $\\rightarrow 18:1 \\Delta 11$ ($n-7$).

We must also calculate the total consumption of nicotinamide hydride equivalents for this transformation.\n\nThe starting substrate is linoleoyl-CoA, which has the structure $\\mathrm{C}_{18:2\\ \\Delta 9,12}$. This is a fatty acyl-CoA with a chain of $18$ carbons and two double bonds located between carbon $9$ and $10$, and carbon $12$ and $13$, counting from the carboxyl carbon ($\\mathrm{C}1$).\n\nThe final product is arachidonoyl-CoA, $\\mathrm{C}_{20:4\\ \\Delta 5,8,11,14}$.

Based on the fundamentals provided:\n- The increase of $2$ carbons must be accomplished by one cycle of microsomal elongation.\n- The increase of $2$ double bonds must be accomplished by two separate desaturation reactions.\n\nThe pathway thus consists of one elongation and two desaturation steps. We must determine the correct sequence of these three reactions. Let us consider the logical possibilities. The problem explicitly states that a single two-carbon elongation is involved.\n\nLet us evaluate the pathway beginning with desaturation, followed by elongation, and then a final desaturation. This is the canonical n-6 pathway.\n\nStep 1: Desaturation of Linoleoyl-CoA ($\\mathrm{C}_{18:2\\ \\Delta 9,12}$)\nThe crucial first step in the biosynthesis of arachidonic acid from linoleic acid in mammals is the introduction of a double bond at the $\\Delta^6$ position.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide cofactors are saturating and do not contribute elasticities.\n\nExperimental perturbations at steady state have measured the following scaled elasticities with respect to the internal stearoyl–coenzyme A pool: ELOVL6 shows weak product inhibition with $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{stearoyl\\text{-}CoA}}^{\\mathrm{ELOVL6}} = -0.20$, and SCD1 shows substrate dependence with $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{stearoyl\\text{-}CoA}}^{\\mathrm{SCD1}} = +0.80$. All other elasticities with respect to the internal metabolite are negligible for this module. The flux of interest $J$ is the net steady-state production rate of oleoyl–coenzyme A.\n\nUsing the foundational framework of Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA), determine the scaled flux control coefficients of ELOVL6 and SCD1 over $J$, then use the differential control prediction to estimate the fractional change in $J$ when the catalytic capacity (effective enzyme activity) of each enzyme is reduced individually by $50\\%$ from the reference steady state, assuming local elasticities remain approximately constant over this perturbation.\n\nLet $Q$ denote the product of the absolute values of the two predicted fractional changes in $J$ (one for the ELOVL6 reduction, one for the SCD1 reduction). Report $Q$ as a dimensionless number. Do not round; provide the exact decimal implied by the given data.", "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a direct application of the foundational principles of Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA) to a defined biochemical system. All necessary data are provided, and the problem structure is logical.\n\nThe problem describes a $2$-step unbranched metabolic pathway operating at steady state. Let the two enzymes be denoted as $E_1$ for Elongation of Very Long-chain fatty acids 6 (ELOVL6) and $E_2$ for Stearoyl–Coenzyme A Desaturase 1 (SCD1). The single internal metabolite, stearoyl–coenzyme A, will be denoted by $S$. The pathway can be represented as:\n$$ \\text{Palmitoyl-CoA} \\xrightarrow{v_1, E_1} S \\xrightarrow{v_2, E_2} \\text{Oleoyl-CoA} $$\nwhere $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the reaction rates of enzymes $E_1$ and $E_2$, respectively. At steady state, the production and consumption rates of the internal metabolite $S$ are equal, meaning the fluxes through both steps are identical and equal to the overall pathway flux, $J$.\n$$ J = v_1 = v_2 $$\nThe problem provides the scaled elasticities of the two reaction rates with respect to the concentration of the internal metabolite $S$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_S^{v_1} = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{stearoyl\\text{-}CoA}}^{\\mathrm{ELOVL6}} = -0.20 $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_S^{v_2} = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{stearoyl\\text{-}CoA}}^{\\mathrm{SCD1}} = +0.80 $$\nThe elasticity $\\varepsilon_S^{v_1}$ is negative, consistent with the described product inhibition of $E_1$ by $S$. The elasticity $\\varepsilon_S^{v_2}$ is positive, consistent with the substrate dependence of $E_2$ on $S$.\n\nOur first task is to determine the flux control coefficients, $C_{E_1}^J$ and $C_{E_2}^J$. A flux control coefficient $C_{E_i}^J$ quantifies the fractional change in the steady-state flux $J$ resulting from a fractional change in the activity of enzyme $E_i$. These coefficients can be determined using the summation and connectivity theorems of MCA.\n\nThe flux control summation theorem states that the sum of all flux control coefficients in a system equals $1$. For this $2$-enzyme system:\n$$ C_{E_1}^J + C_{E_2}^J = 1 \\quad (1) $$\n\nThe flux control connectivity theorem relates the control coefficients to the elasticities with respect to any metabolite. For the internal metabolite $S$, the theorem is:\n$$ \\sum_{i} C_{E_i}^J \\varepsilon_S^{v_i} = 0 $$\nFor this system, this becomes:\n$$ C_{E_1}^J \\varepsilon_S^{v_1} + C_{E_2}^J \\varepsilon_S^{v_2} = 0 \\quad (2) $$\nSubstituting the given elasticity values into equation $(2)$:\n$$ C_{E_1}^J (-0.20) + C_{E_2}^J (+0.80) = 0 $$\n$$ -0.20 C_{E_1}^J + 0.80 C_{E_2}^J = 0 $$\n$$ 0.20 C_{E_1}^J = 0.80 C_{E_2}^J $$\n$$ C_{E_1}^J = \\frac{0.80}{0.20} C_{E_2}^J = 4 C_{E_2}^J $$\nNow, we substitute this relationship into the summation theorem (equation $(1)$):\n$$ 4 C_{E_2}^J + C_{E_2}^J = 1 $$\n$$ 5 C_{E_2}^J = 1 $$\n$$ C_{E_2}^J = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.20 $$\nUsing this result, we find $C_{E_1}^J$:\n$$ C_{E_1}^J = 4 C_{E_2}^J = 4(0.20) = 0.80 $$\nSo, the flux control coefficients are $C_{\\text{ELOVL6}}^J = 0.80$ and $C_{\\text{SCD1}}^J = 0.20$.\n\nThe second task is to estimate the fractional change in flux $J$, denoted $\\frac{\\Delta J}{J}$, when the catalytic capacity of each enzyme is individually reduced by $50\\%$. The fractional change in enzyme activity is $\\frac{\\Delta E}{E} = -0.50$.\nThe definition of the flux control coefficient is:\n$$ C_E^J = \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\ln J}{\\mathrm{d} \\ln E} = \\frac{\\partial J/J}{\\partial E/E} $$\nFor a small, finite perturbation, we can use the linear approximation:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta J}{J} \\approx C_E^J \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta E}{E} $$\nThis approximation is valid under the problem's assumption that local elasticities remain constant.\n\nCase 1: Reduction of ELOVL6 ($E_1$) activity by $50\\%$.\nThe fractional change in flux, $(\\frac{\\Delta J}{J})_1$, is:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\Delta J}{J}\\right)_1 \\approx C_{E_1}^J \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta E_1}{E_1} = (0.80) \\cdot (-0.50) = -0.40 $$\n\nCase 2: Reduction of SCD1 ($E_2$) activity by $50\\%$.\nThe fractional change in flux, $(\\frac{\\Delta J}{J})_2$, is:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\Delta J}{J}\\right)_2 \\approx C_{E_2}^J \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta E_2}{E_2} = (0.20) \\cdot (-0.50) = -0.10 $$\n\nThe final task is to calculate $Q$, the product of the absolute values of these two fractional flux changes.\n$$ Q = \\left| \\left(\\frac{\\Delta J}{J}\\right)_1 \\right| \\times \\left| \\left(\\frac{\\Delta J}{J}\\right)_2 \\right| $$\n$$ Q = |-0.40| \\times |-0.10| $$\n$$ Q = (0.40) \\times (0.10) = 0.04 $$\nThe value of $Q$ is reported as a dimensionless number as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.04}$$", "id": "2559709"}]}
