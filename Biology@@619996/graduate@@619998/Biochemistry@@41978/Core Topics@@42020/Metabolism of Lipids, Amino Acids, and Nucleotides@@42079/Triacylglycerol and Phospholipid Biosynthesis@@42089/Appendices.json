Each acyltransferase uses an acyl-CoA and releases coenzyme A (CoA; coenzyme A).

The analysis will proceed by dissecting the synthesis pathway into its constituent chemical reactions as defined in the problem statement.\n\nThe overall process can be broken down into three main stages:\n$1$. Activation of three molecules of palmitate to their coenzyme A (CoA) thioester derivatives.\n$2$. Stepwise acylation of one molecule of G3P to form phosphatidic acid, followed by its dephosphorylation to diacylglycerol (DAG).\n$3$. Acylation of DAG to form TAG.\n\nLet us write the balanced chemical equation for each step involved in the synthesis of one mole of TAG.\n\nStep 1: Fatty Acid Activation\nEach of the three moles of palmitate must be activated by conversion to palmitoyl-CoA. This reaction is catalyzed by long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase. According to the problem, this process consumes one mole of ATP, yielding adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). This occurs for each of the three moles of palmitate.\nThe reaction is:\n$$\n\\text{Palmitate} + \\text{ATP} + \\text{CoA} \\to \\text{Palmitoyl-CoA} + \\text{AMP} + \\text{PPi}\n$$\nFor three moles of palmitate, the stoichiometry is:\n$$\n(1) \\quad 3\\; \\text{Palmitate} + 3\\; \\text{ATP} + 3\\; \\text{CoA} \\to 3\\; \\text{Palmitoyl-CoA} + 3\\; \\text{AMP} + 3\\; \\text{PPi}\n$$\nThe problem states that the generated PPi is subsequently hydrolyzed to two moles of inorganic phosphate (Pi) by inorganic pyrophosphatase.

Specifically, the reaction ATP $\\to$ AMP + PPi, followed by PPi $\\to 2$ Pi, is equivalent to the cleavage of two high-energy bonds, or $2$ ATP equivalents.\n\nThe only step in the entire pathway that consumes ATP is the activation of fatty acids (Step 1). All other steps are transfers or hydrolyses that do not directly involve ATP. The synthesis of one mole of TAG requires the activation of three moles of palmitate.\nEach activation reaction consumes one mole of ATP to form AMP and PPi.\n$$\n\\text{Palmitate} + \\text{ATP} \\to \\text{Palmitoyl-CoA} + \\text{AMP} + \\text{PPi}\n$$\nAs stated, the subsequent hydrolysis of PPi makes this process equivalent to the hydrolysis of $2$ ATP molecules to ADP + Pi.\nCost per fatty acid activated = $2$ ATP equivalents.\nSince $3$ moles of palmitate are incorporated into one mole of TAG, the total number of fatty acid activation events is $3$.\nTotal ATP equivalent cost, $N$, is the number of activations multiplied by the cost per activation.\n$$\nN = 3\\; (\\text{activations}) \\times 2\\; (\\text{ATP equivalents per activation})\n$$\n$$\nN = 6\n$$\nNo other synthesis or degradation steps described in the problem consume or produce ATP equivalents. The problem explicitly forbids accounting for the synthesis of G3P, which could otherwise alter the energy balance.

The stoichiometry of TAG hydrolysis is:\n$$1 \\text{ TAG} \\rightarrow 1 \\text{ Glycerol} + 3 \\text{ FA}$$\nAt steady state, the rate of production of any species must equal its rate of consumption plus its net rate of efflux. The problem states that intracellular glycerol kinase activity is negligible, meaning glycerol is not consumed within the cell.
