This is the committed step for malonyl-CoA formation.\n- Fatty acid synthase (FAS) initiates with an acetyl group as a primer and then elongates the chain by iterative two-carbon additions derived from malonyl groups with decarboxylation at each condensation step, until palmitate is released by hydrolysis.\n- Each elongation cycle on FAS consists of a condensation, a reduction by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), a dehydration, and a second reduction by NADPH.

Its malonyl group is loaded, releasing one CoA-SH. The subsequent condensation step is a decarboxylation, releasing one CO$_2$. The cycle involves two reduction steps, each consuming one NADPH, and one dehydration step, producing one H$_2$O.\n  - Total for $7$ cycles:\n    - Reactants: $7$ Malonyl-CoA, $14$ NADPH ($2 \\times 7$)\n    - Products: $7$ CoA-SH, $7$ CO$_2$, $7$ H$_2$O, $14$ NADP$^{+}$\n\n- **Termination**: The final $C_{16}$ chain (palmitoyl-ACP) is hydrolyzed to release free palmitate.

Overall Reaction for Palmitate Synthesis**\nTo obtain the overall reaction, we sum Equation 1 (malonyl-CoA synthesis) and Equation 2 (FAS reaction).\n\nEq. 1: $7\\ \\text{Acetyl-CoA} + 7\\ \\text{HCO}_3^- + 7\\ \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow 7\\ \\text{Malonyl-CoA} + 7\\ \\text{ADP} + 7\\ \\text{P}_{\\text{i}}$\nEq. 2: $1\\ \\text{Acetyl-CoA} + 7\\ \\text{Malonyl-CoA} + 14\\ \\text{NADPH} \\rightarrow 1\\ \\text{Palmitate} + 8\\ \\text{CoA-SH} + 7\\ \\text{CO}_2 + 6\\ \\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 14\\ \\text{NADP}^{+}$\n\nSumming these two equations and canceling the intermediate species ($7$ Malonyl-CoA) yields:\n$$ (7+1)\\ \\text{Acetyl-CoA} + 7\\ \\text{HCO}_3^- + 7\\ \\text{ATP} + 14\\ \\text{NADPH} \\rightarrow 1\\ \\text{Palmitate} + 8\\ \\text{CoA-SH} + 7\\ \\text{CO}_2 + (7\\ \\text{ADP} + 7\\ \\text{P}_{\\text{i}}) + 6\\ \\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 14\\ \\text{NADP}^{+} $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ 8\\ \\text{Acetyl-CoA} + 7\\ \\text{ATP} + 14\\ \\text{NADPH} + 7\\ \\text{HCO}_3^- \\rightarrow 1\\ \\text{Palmitate} + 8\\ \\text{CoA-SH} + 7\\ \\text{ADP} + 7\\ \\text{P}_{\\text{i}} + 14\\ \\text{NADP}^{+} + 6\\ \\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 7\\ \\text{CO}_2 $$\n\n**4. Final Stoichiometry and Inorganic Carbon Balance**\nThe problem requires confirmation that the net consumption of inorganic carbon is zero. Our derived equation shows the consumption of $7$ molecules of bicarbonate (HCO$_3^-$) and the production of $7$ molecules of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$). Thus, there is no net change in the total pool of inorganic carbon, confirming the statement.\n$$ 7\\ \\text{HCO}_3^- \\rightarrow 7\\ \\text{CO}_2 $$\nAs these species cancel out in terms of net carbon flux and are not part of the final requested list of metabolites, they are omitted from the final net equation.

This exercise presents a hypothetical scenario to explore the powerful concept of metabolic microdomains. By considering the consequences of artificially relocating an enzyme, you will reason from first principles about how proximity between an enzyme and its regulatory target can create localized signaling hubs that govern metabolic flux, in this case, the crucial decision between storing or burning fatty acids [@problem_id:2554217].", "problem": "You engineer mammalian cells in which Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase isoform 1 (ACC1; Acetyl-CoA carboxylase) is fused to an outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) anchor such that its catalytic domain faces the cytosol, while Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase isoform 2 (ACC2) is deleted. The catalytic properties and regulation of ACC1 are otherwise unchanged relative to wild-type ACC1 (same $K_m$ values, allosteric activation by citrate, inhibition by long-chain acyl-CoA, and phosphorylation sensitivity to Adenosine Monophosphate-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK)), and the total cellular ACC activity at a given citrate and phosphorylation state is held equal to control cells that express cytosolic ACC1 and OMM-localized ACC2. You examine the consequences for malonyl-CoA signaling and fatty acid oxidation flux.\n\nUse only the following foundational facts to reason from first principles:\n- ACC catalyzes carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA in the cytosol, consuming adenosine triphosphate and bicarbonate; the catalytic face of both ACC isoforms resides in the cytosol when associated with the OMM.\n- Malonyl-CoA is a large, multiply charged coenzyme A thioester that does not cross biological membranes and exhibits limited free diffusion in the cytosol because of macromolecular crowding and protein binding.\n- Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) resides on the OMM with an active site exposed to the cytosol and is directly inhibited by cytosolic malonyl-CoA; flux of long-chain acyl groups into mitochondria for $\\beta$-oxidation depends on CPT1 activity.\n- Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN; fatty acid synthase) uses cytosolic malonyl-CoA to elongate acyl chains during de novo fatty acid synthesis; FASN is not membrane-embedded and accesses the cytosolic malonyl-CoA pool.\n\nAssume the cells are in a fed-like state with high citrate and low AMPK activity so that ACC enzymes are active in both genotypes. You measure identical total malonyl-CoA content per cell between the engineered and control lines, but you cannot directly resolve subcellular microdomains by bulk extraction.\n\nWhich prediction best captures how relocating ACC1 to the OMM will alter malonyl-CoA signaling to CPT1 and the resulting flux through mitochondrial fatty acid $\\beta$-oxidation, and why?\n\nA. Local malonyl-CoA concentration in the cytosolic microdomain juxtaposed to the OMM increases, strengthening CPT1 inhibition and decreasing fatty acid oxidation flux, even if total cellular malonyl-CoA is unchanged, because production is repositioned next to the CPT1 regulatory site and malonyl-CoA does not equilibrate instantaneously across the cytosol.\n\nB. Malonyl-CoA produced by OMM-tethered ACC1 accumulates inside the mitochondrion where CPT1 cannot sense it, relieving inhibition of CPT1 and increasing fatty acid oxidation flux, because mitochondrial membranes restrict exchange of charged metabolites.\n\nC. Relocating ACC1 to the OMM diverts acetyl-CoA away from cytosolic FASN, lowering cytosolic malonyl-CoA near CPT1 and increasing fatty acid oxidation flux, because FASN creates a sink that draws malonyl-CoA away from the mitochondrial surface.\n\nD. There is no substantive change in CPT1 inhibition or fatty acid oxidation flux, because malonyl-CoA rapidly equilibrates throughout the cytosol such that its local concentration at the OMM depends only on total malonyl-CoA, not on the site of synthesis.", "solution": "Begin from the core definitions and biophysical constraints provided.\n\nACC catalysis and localization. Both Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (ACC) isoforms perform the same chemistry: cytosolic acetyl-CoA is carboxylated to malonyl-CoA. When an ACC is anchored on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), its catalytic face remains cytosolic. Therefore, in both control cells (cytosolic ACC1 and OMM-anchored ACC2) and engineered cells (OMM-anchored ACC1 with ACC2 deleted), malonyl-CoA is generated into the cytosolic space. The experimental manipulation changes the spatial origin of malonyl-CoA synthesis but not the side of the membrane to which it is delivered.\n\nMembrane impermeability and microdomains. Malonyl-CoA, a bulky and polyanionic coenzyme A derivative, does not cross biological membranes and exhibits limited effective diffusion in the cytosol due to macromolecular crowding and reversible binding to proteins. These factors produce concentration gradients and microdomains when production and consumption occur in spatially segregated regions, even if total cellular content is the same. Consequently, the local cytosolic malonyl-CoA concentration adjacent to the OMM can deviate from the bulk mean if synthesis is repositioned to that membrane.\n\nCPT1 inhibition and fatty acid oxidation flux. Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) sits in the OMM with its regulatory site in the cytosol and is directly inhibited by malonyl-CoA in that cytosolic microenvironment. A standard kinetic description of a flux $J_{\\mathrm{FAO}}$ limited by an enzyme inhibited by a ligand is that $J_{\\mathrm{FAO}}$ decreases monotonically as the inhibitor concentration near the enzyme’s active site increases, for example through an inhibition term of the general form\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{FAO}} \\propto \\frac{1}{1 + \\left([\\mathrm{malonyl\\text{-}CoA}]_{\\mathrm{local}}/K_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right)^{n}},\n$$\nwhere $K_{\\mathrm{i}}$ is an inhibition constant and $n$ reflects inhibitory modality. While the precise parameters are not needed, the directionality is: larger local $[\\mathrm{malonyl\\text{-}CoA}]$ at the OMM yields smaller $J_{\\mathrm{FAO}}$.\n\nComparative microdomain logic. In control cells, ACC2 creates malonyl-CoA directly in the OMM-adjacent cytosolic microdomain, positioning the inhibitor at the site of CPT1 regulation. Cytosolic ACC1 contributes to the bulk cytosolic pool, which can reach CPT1 by diffusion, but with lower effective concentration at the OMM because of distance, binding, and consumption by FASN elsewhere. In engineered cells lacking ACC2 but with ACC1 relocated to the OMM, the production of malonyl-CoA is again colocated with CPT1. Total cellular malonyl-CoA is experimentally matched between the two conditions, but the spatial distribution differs: synthesis at the OMM elevates the local cytosolic concentration near CPT1 relative to a scenario in which synthesis occurs farther away.\n\nTherefore, even at equal total malonyl-CoA per cell, OMM-localized ACC activity increases the inhibitor concentration at CPT1 and should strengthen CPT1 inhibition. This reduces the entry of long-chain acyl groups into mitochondria and lowers fatty acid $\\beta$-oxidation flux. Because FASN remains in the cytosol and accesses the cytosolic pool, its access is not abolished by OMM localization of ACC; any impact on FASN is secondary and not required to infer the change in CPT1-mediated flux.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This option asserts that OMM-localized ACC1 increases the local cytosolic malonyl-CoA concentration where CPT1 senses it, thereby increasing inhibition and decreasing fatty acid oxidation flux, independent of total malonyl-CoA. This follows directly from the impermeability of membranes to malonyl-CoA, the existence of cytosolic microdomains with finite diffusion, and the colocalization of synthesis and the regulatory target at the OMM. The directionality of flux change is consistent with the inhibitory dependence $J_{\\mathrm{FAO}} \\downarrow$ as $[\\mathrm{malonyl\\text{-}CoA}]_{\\mathrm{local}} \\uparrow$. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. This option incorrectly states that malonyl-CoA accumulates inside mitochondria. The engineered ACC1 catalytic domain faces the cytosol, and ACC catalysis produces malonyl-CoA in the cytosol, not in the matrix or intermembrane space. Thus CPT1, which senses cytosolic malonyl-CoA, will see more, not less, inhibitor when synthesis is colocalized. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. This option claims that relocating ACC1 diverts acetyl-CoA away from FASN and thereby lowers cytosolic malonyl-CoA near CPT1. FASN does not produce malonyl-CoA; it consumes it. Moreover, acetyl-CoA carboxylation remains in the cytosol and is not made less accessible to FASN simply by being generated near the OMM; any sink created by FASN is spatially diffuse relative to the sharp impact of colocalizing the source with CPT1. The predicted increase, not decrease, in local malonyl-CoA at the OMM contradicts the option’s conclusion. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. This option assumes instantaneous equilibration of malonyl-CoA across the cytosol, rendering localization irrelevant. That assumption conflicts with the stated foundational fact of limited diffusion and protein buffering for malonyl-CoA. Empirically and theoretically, spatially restricted production of poorly diffusive, protein-bound metabolites yields microdomains that matter for membrane-associated targets like CPT1. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nThus, colocating ACC activity with the OMM strengthens malonyl-CoA signaling to CPT1 and decreases fatty acid oxidation flux, even at unchanged total malonyl-CoA per cell, by elevating the inhibitor concentration specifically at the regulatory site that controls mitochondrial entry of fatty acyl groups.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2554217"}, {"introduction": "Metabolism is a dynamic network, and understanding it requires tracking the flow of atoms through interconnected pathways.

It presents a standard isotopic labeling experiment scenario in biochemistry, requiring logical deduction based on established metabolic pathways. The problem is therefore valid, and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe objective is to determine the fraction of palmitate molecules that are fully labeled, denoted as $\\mathrm{M}+16$, meaning all $16$ of its carbon atoms are $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$. This analysis begins with the synthesis of palmitate and the origin of its carbon atoms.\n\nPalmitate is a $16$-carbon saturated fatty acid. Its *de novo* synthesis is catalyzed by fatty acid synthase (FASN). The process requires two types of precursors derived from acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA): one molecule of acetyl-CoA serves as a primer, and seven molecules of malonyl-CoA serve as extender units. Each malonyl-CoA is synthesized from one molecule of acetyl-CoA and one molecule of bicarbonate by the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC).\n\nThe crucial step for carbon tracing is the condensation reaction within the FASN complex. For each of the seven elongation steps, a two-carbon unit is added to the growing acyl chain. This two-carbon unit originates from the acetyl portion of malonyl-CoA. The carboxyl group of malonyl-CoA, which was added from bicarbonate by ACC, is released as carbon dioxide ($\\text{CO}_{2}$). Therefore, the carbon backbone of the final palmitate molecule is constructed exclusively from the two-carbon acetyl groups of the precursor CoA esters. Specifically, one acetyl-CoA molecule (the primer) and seven acetyl-CoA molecules (which were converted to malonyl-CoA) contribute their two-carbon units. In total, the $16$ carbons of palmitate are derived from $8$ distinct acetyl-CoA molecules.\n\nFor a palmitate molecule to be fully labeled, $\\mathrm{M}+16$, each of its $16$ carbons must be $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$. Since each of the $8$ contributing acetyl-CoA units provides $2$ carbons to the palmitate backbone, this requires that all $8$ of these acetyl-CoA molecules must be the doubly-labeled isotopologue, $\\mathrm{M}+2$.\n\nThe problem states that the cytosolic pool of acetyl-CoA is supplied by two sources.\n$1$. A fraction, denoted by $f$, originates from mitochondrial citrate that has been exported to the cytosol and cleaved by ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY). This citrate is formed from PDH-derived acetyl-CoA, which in turn comes from uniformly labeled glucose. The problem explicitly states that acetyl-CoA from this route is $\\mathrm{M}+2$ (both carbons are $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$).\n$2$. The remaining fraction, $1-f$, originates from an unlabeled acetate source. This acetyl-CoA is therefore $\\mathrm{M}+0$ (both carbons are $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$).\n\nThe problem specifies that the cellular pools are large and homogeneous, allowing the selection of each of the $8$ acetyl-CoA molecules for palmitate synthesis to be treated as an independent and identically distributed random event. Let $P(\\mathrm{M}+2)$ be the probability of selecting an $\\mathrm{M}+2$ acetyl-CoA molecule from the cytosolic pool, and $P(\\mathrm{M}+0)$ be the probability of selecting an $\\mathrm{M}+0$ molecule. Based on the fractional contributions of the two sources, we have:\n$$P(\\mathrm{M}+2) = f$$\n$$P(\\mathrm{M}+0) = 1-f$$\n\nFor a single molecule of palmitate to be fully labeled ($\\mathrm{M}+16$), all $8$ of the acetyl-CoA molecules incorporated into its structure must be of the $\\mathrm{M}+2$ type. Since the selections are independent events, the probability of this specific outcome is the product of the probabilities of each individual selection.\n\nLet $F_{\\mathrm{M}+16}$ be the fraction of palmitate that is fully labeled. This fraction is equivalent to the probability that a randomly synthesized palmitate molecule is $\\mathrm{M}+16$.\n$$F_{\\mathrm{M}+16} = P(\\text{1st is M+2}) \\times P(\\text{2nd is M+2}) \\times \\dots \\times P(\\text{8th is M+2})$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{M}+16} = [P(\\mathrm{M}+2)]^8$$\nSubstituting the probability in terms of $f$, we derive the expression for the fraction of $\\mathrm{M}+16$ palmitate:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{M}+16} = f^8$$\n\nThis is the general expression for the fraction of fully labeled palmitate in terms of $f$.\n\nThe second part of the task is to evaluate this expression for the specific case where $f = 0.80$.\n$$F_{\\mathrm{M}+16} = (0.80)^8$$\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$(0.80)^2 = 0.64$$\n$$(0.80)^4 = (0.64)^2 = 0.4096$$\n$$(0.80)^8 = (0.4096)^2 = 0.16777216$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $6$, $7$, $7$. The fifth significant figure is $7$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$F_{\\mathrm{M}+16} \\approx 0.1678$$\n\nThus, when $80\\%$ of the cytosolic acetyl-CoA is derived from the labeled glucose source, approximately $16.78\\%$ of the newly synthesized palmitate will be fully labeled.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.1678}\n$$", "id": "2554309"}]}
