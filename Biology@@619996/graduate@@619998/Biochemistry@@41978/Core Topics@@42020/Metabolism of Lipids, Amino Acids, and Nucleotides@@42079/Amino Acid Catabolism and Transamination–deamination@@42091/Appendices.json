By combining a transamination step with an oxidative deamination step, you will derive the net balanced equation for the complete conversion of an amino acid's nitrogen into free ammonia. This exercise highlights the efficiency of metabolic pathways, where intermediates like glutamate and $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate act catalytically to funnel nitrogen from various amino acids into a single, disposable form [@problem_id:2030792].", "id": "2030792", "problem": "The complete catabolism of the amino acid alanine in the liver to its corresponding $\\alpha$-keto acid and a free ammonium ion is a two-step pathway known as transdeamination. This process is essential for nitrogen excretion and for providing carbon skeletons for gluconeogenesis.\n\nThe first step is a transamination reaction catalyzed by Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT). In this reaction, alanine transfers its amino group to $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate.\n\nThe second step is the oxidative deamination of the amino acid product from the first step. This reaction is catalyzed by Glutamate Dehydrogenase (GDH) which utilizes a specific coenzyme, Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD‚Å∫), for oxidation. This step regenerates the $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate used in the first step and releases an ammonium ion.\n\nAssume that all metabolic intermediates, such as $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate and glutamate, are part of a catalytic cycle and are regenerated, and therefore do not appear as net reactants or products in the overall process. The overall net balanced chemical equation for the conversion of alanine can be represented as:\n$$a \\cdot \\text{Alanine} + b \\cdot \\text{NAD}^{+} + c \\cdot \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow d \\cdot \\text{Pyruvate} + e \\cdot \\text{NADH} + f \\cdot \\text{H}^{+} + g \\cdot \\text{NH}_4^{+}$$\nDetermine the set of the smallest possible integer stoichiometric coefficients $(a, b, c, d, e, f, g)$ for this net reaction.\n\n", "solution": "We proceed by writing the two enzymatic steps explicitly and summing them, canceling intermediates that are part of the catalytic cycle as stated.\n\nThe ALT-catalyzed transamination transfers the amino group from alanine to $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate:\n$$\n\\text{Alanine} + \\alpha\\text{-ketoglutarate} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Pyruvate} + \\text{Glutamate}.\n$$\nThe GDH-catalyzed oxidative deamination of glutamate uses $\\text{NAD}^{+}$ and water, regenerates $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate, and releases ammonium:\n$$\n\\text{Glutamate} + \\text{NAD}^{+} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O} \\rightleftharpoons \\alpha\\text{-ketoglutarate} + \\text{NH}_{4}^{+} + \\text{NADH} + \\text{H}^{+}.\n$$\nAdding these two equations cancels $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate and glutamate, yielding the net reaction:\n$$\n\\text{Alanine} + \\text{NAD}^{+} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{Pyruvate} + \\text{NADH} + \\text{H}^{+} + \\text{NH}_{4}^{+}.\n$$\nThis shows directly that each stoichiometric coefficient is unity.

Many key reactions, including transaminations, operate near equilibrium with a standard Gibbs free energy change ($\\Delta G^{\\circ'}$) close to zero, meaning their net direction is highly sensitive to the concentrations of substrates and products. This problem explores the thermodynamic regulation of the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) reaction during fasting, asking you to identify which interconnected pathways provide the \"pull\" by consuming its products, thereby driving the flow of carbon and nitrogen in response to systemic needs [@problem_id:2030800].", "id": "2030800", "problem": "In a hepatocyte during a state of prolonged fasting, the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) catalyzes a readily reversible reaction central to amino acid catabolism.

This consumption of pyruvate lowers $[\\text{pyruvate}]$ and thermodynamically pulls the ALT reaction forward.\n\nConcurrently, nitrogen disposal is active via the urea cycle.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in biochemistry that requires a direct application of the principles of chemical equilibrium.

Thus, $Q = 2.00$.\n\nTo determine the direction of net flux, we compare $Q$ with the given apparent equilibrium constant, $K' = 1.00$. The thermodynamic principles governing this are:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item If $Q < K'$, the reaction is not at equilibrium and will proceed spontaneously in the forward direction (left to right) to generate more products.\n    \\item If $Q > K'$, the reaction will proceed spontaneously in the reverse direction (right to left) to generate more reactants.\n    \\item If $Q = K'$, the reaction is at equilibrium, and there is no net flux in either direction.\n\\end{enumerate}\nIn this case, we have $Q = 2.00$ and $K' = 1.00$. Since $Q > K'$, the system must shift to reduce the value of $Q$ to approach $K'$.
