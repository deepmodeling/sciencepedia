This thermodynamic \"pull\" exerted by the high-potential Rieske cluster facilitates the sequential deprotonation events. The first proton is released upon formation of the semiquinone radical, and the second is released upon its subsequent oxidation. The large free energy drop of the initial electron transfer effectively pays the energetic cost of these deprotonation steps, ensuring that the protons are released into the intermembrane space, even against a pre-existing proton gradient.
