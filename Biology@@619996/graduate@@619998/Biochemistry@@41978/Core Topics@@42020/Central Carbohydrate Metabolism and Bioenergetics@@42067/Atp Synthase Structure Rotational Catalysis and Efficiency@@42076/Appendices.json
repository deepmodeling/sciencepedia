In bacteria, each $c$-subunit typically presents a conserved carboxylate (for example, $c\\text{Asp}$) that undergoes protonation and deprotonation as it transits between two half-channels in the stator $a$-subunit. A conserved positively charged residue in the $a$-subunit (for example, $a\\text{Arg}$) electrostatically gates the deprotonated $c\\text{Asp}$ and shapes the angular dependence of the torque $\\tau(\\theta)$ via a strong angle-localized interaction.

The mutated $c$-site no longer supports a biologically relevant acid-base equilibrium (no defined $pK_{a}$ near physiological pH), so it cannot bind or release a proton along the transport path. The loss of the $c\\text{Asp}$ carboxylate eliminates the strong angle-localized electrostatic interaction with $a\\text{Arg}$ at that azimuth, abolishing the corresponding peak in $\\tau(\\theta)$; the torque-angle profile therefore loses one of the approximately $N$ periodic features and exhibits reduced amplitude and a gap where torque contribution is minimal, approaching an approximately $(N-1)$-fold periodicity.

The $c\\text{Asn}$ amide stabilizes a proton through hydrogen bonding, effectively raising the local $pK_{a}$ by approximately $2$ units and increasing proton occupancy at the mutated site; this increases the magnitude and sharpness of the angle-localized interaction with $a\\text{Arg}$, yielding a larger peak in $\\tau(\\theta)$ at that azimuth and an overall increase in maximum average torque by a factor greater than $N/(N-1)$ due to improved coupling.\n\nC.

The roles of the specified amino acid residues ($c\\text{Asp}$ and $a\\text{Arg}$) are central to the accepted model. The specified mutation, $c\\text{Asp}\\rightarrow c\\text{Asn}$, is a chemically well-defined change whose consequences can be predicted from fundamental principles of amino acid chemistry and protein biophysics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters ($N=10$, environmental conditions, specific mutation) and simplifying assumptions (tight coupling) to allow for a focused, logical deduction. The language is objective and precise. The physical values given are realistic for bacterial bioenergetics. The problem is not trivial; it requires a synthesis of knowledge from chemistry, physics, and biology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A rigorous analysis can now proceed.\n\n**Analysis of the System and Mutation**\n\nThe wild-type function relies on the acid-base chemistry of the aspartic acid ($c\\text{Asp}$) side chain, which has a carboxyl group, $-\\text{CH}_2\\text{COOH}$. This group can be deprotonated to form a negatively charged carboxylate, $-\\text{CH}_2\\text{COO}^-$. The local $pK_{a}$ of this residue is tuned by the protein environment to allow protonation on the acidic side of the membrane (periplasm, low pH) and deprotonation on the basic side (cytoplasm, high pH). The torque $\\tau(\\theta)$ is generated primarily by the strong, long-range electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged, deprotonated $c\\text{Asp}$ and the positively charged $a\\text{Arg}$ in the stator. This creates $N$ deep potential energy wells and corresponding torque peaks per revolution, giving the torque profile an $N$-fold periodicity.\n\nThe mutation replaces aspartic acid with asparagine ($c\\text{Asn}$). The side chain of asparagine is an amide, $-\\text{CH}_2\\text{CONH}_2$. This group is chemically distinct from a carboxyl group. The amide group is essentially neutral and non-ionizable over the entire physiological pH range. The $pK_{a}$ for protonating the amide oxygen is extremely low ($<0$), and the $pK_{a}$ for deprotonating the amide nitrogen is extremely high ($>16$). Therefore, the $c\\text{Asn}$ side chain will not participate in the protonation-deprotonation cycle.\n\n**Consequences of the Mutation:**\n\n1.  **Proton Transport**: The mutated $c$-subunit site is functionally inert for proton transport. It cannot bind a proton from the periplasmic half-channel nor release one into the cytoplasmic half-channel.\n\n2.  **Torque Profile, $\\tau(\\theta)$**: The strong electrostatic interaction responsible for the torque peak requires a charged $c$-subunit site. Since the $c\\text{Asn}$ side chain is permanently neutral, the charge-charge interaction with $a\\text{Arg}$ is eliminated at the angular position corresponding to this mutated subunit. Consequently, the torque peak at this position will be abolished. The overall torque profile $\\tau(\\theta)$ will lose one of its $N$ characteristic peaks. The profile will no longer have $N$-fold rotational symmetry; it will instead show $N-1$ peaks distributed over $360^\\circ$.\n\n3.  **Average Torque**: The total work done per revolution, $W_{\\text{rev}}$, is the integral of the torque, $W_{\\text{rev}} = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\tau(\\theta) d\\theta = 2\\pi \\langle \\tau \\rangle$, where $\\langle \\tau \\rangle$ is the average torque. Under the assumption of tight coupling, this work is equal to the total free energy harnessed from proton translocation per revolution.\n    In a wild-type enzyme, $N$ protons are translocated per revolution. The energy harnessed is $W_{\\text{WT}} = N \\cdot |\\Delta G_{\\text{H}^+}|$, where $|\\Delta G_{\\text{H}^+}|$ is the magnitude of the free energy change for translocating one mole of protons, determined by the proton motive force.\n    In the mutant, only the $N-1$ functional $c$-subunits can translocate protons. Thus, only $N-1$ protons are moved per revolution. The energy harnessed is $W_{\\text{mutant}} = (N-1) \\cdot |\\Delta G_{\\text{H}^+}|$.\n    The maximum average torque is directly proportional to the work done per revolution. The ratio of the mutant's average torque to the wild-type's average torque is:\n    $$ \\frac{\\langle\\tau\\rangle_{\\text{mutant}}}{\\langle\\tau\\rangle_{\\text{WT}}} = \\frac{W_{\\text{mutant}}/2\\pi}{W_{\\text{WT}}/2\\pi} = \\frac{(N-1) \\cdot |\\Delta G_{\\text{H}^+}|}{N \\cdot |\\Delta G_{\\text{H}^+}|} = \\frac{N-1}{N} $$\n    With $N=10$, this factor is $9/10$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A.** This option correctly states that the $c\\text{Asn}$ site loses its acid-base capability (\"no defined $pK_{a}$ near physiological pH\") and can no longer transport protons. It accurately predicts that the loss of the charged carboxylate eliminates the electrostatic interaction with $a\\text{Arg}$, abolishing the corresponding torque peak and leading to a profile that loses its $N$-fold periodicity. Finally, it correctly deduces from the loss of one proton transport event per revolution that the maximum average torque must decrease by a factor of $(N-1)/N$. All parts of this statement are consistent with the derivation from first principles.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B.** This option makes the chemically false claim that an amide group would be protonated, raising its $pK_{a}$. The asparagine side chain is not basic in this context. Protonation would lead to a positive charge, which would be repelled by the positive $a\\text{Arg}$, contrary to the mechanism. This would decrease, not increase, the torque. The entire premise is incorrect.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C.** This option proposes that a peptide backbone carbonyl can substitute for the side-chain carboxylate. This is structurally and chemically implausible. The backbone carbonyl has the wrong chemical properties (it is not a biologically relevant acid/base) and is not positioned correctly to perform the function of the specifically evolved side chain. If this were true, there would be no reason for the absolute conservation of the acidic residue at this position.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.** This option begins with a statement that is fundamentally incorrect: the $c\\text{Asn}$ side chain is neutral, not \"deprotonated and negatively charged.\" This chemical error invalidates the subsequent reasoning about preserved electrostatic coupling and $N$-fold periodicity. The proposed torque reduction factor of $1/2$ is arbitrary and lacks any mechanistic or thermodynamic basis.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2542633"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice bridges the gap between molecular models and macroscopic observation, a crucial skill in modern biophysics.

Rearranging the equation yields the desired form:\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\tau_c - (\\gamma_{\\mathrm{int}} + \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ext}})\\omega $$\nThis equation is a linear model of the form $y = b + mx$, where $y = \\tau_{\\mathrm{out}}$, $x = \\omega$, the y-intercept is $b = \\tau_c$, and the slope is $m = -(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{int}} + \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ext}})$.\n\nFor each dataset, we will perform an ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression on the provided $(\\omega, \\tau_{\\mathrm{out}})$ data to find the slope $\\hat{m}$ and intercept $\\hat{b}$. From these fitted parameters, we can estimate the physical quantities of interest:\n$$ \\hat{\\tau}_c = \\hat{b} $$\n$$ \\hat{\\gamma}_{\\mathrm{int}} = -\\hat{m} - \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ext}} $$\n\nNext, the internal dissipation fraction $f_{\\mathrm{int}}$ is computed. It is defined as the ratio of the power dissipated internally, $P_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{int}}\\omega^2$, to the chemical input power, $P_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\tau_c \\omega$.\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{int}}(\\omega) = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{int}}}{P_{\\mathrm{in}}} = \\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{int}}\\omega^2}{\\tau_c \\omega} = \\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{int}}\\omega}{\\tau_c} $$\nThis fraction must be evaluated at the specified angular velocity $\\omega_{\\mathrm{eval}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{rad\\,s^{-1}}$ using the estimated parameters $\\hat{\\gamma}_{\\mathrm{int}}$ and $\\hat{\\tau}_c$.\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{int}}(\\omega_{\\mathrm{eval}}) = \\frac{\\hat{\\gamma}_{\\mathrm{int}} \\cdot \\omega_{\\mathrm{eval}}}{\\hat{\\tau}_c} $$\n\nWe now apply this procedure to each dataset.\n\n**Dataset $1$**:\n- Given: $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ext}} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{pN\\cdot nm\\cdot s\\cdot rad^{-1}}$.\n- Data: $\\omega = [0, 5, 10, 15, 20]\\,\\mathrm{rad\\,s^{-1}}$, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{out}} = [50, 40, 30, 20, 10]\\,\\mathrm{pN\\cdot nm}$.\n- The data are perfectly linear. A linear regression of $\\tau_{\\mathrm{out}}$ on $\\omega$ yields an intercept $\\hat{b} = 50.0$ and a slope $\\hat{m} = \\frac{10-50}{20-0} = -2.0$.\n- The parameters are estimated as:\n  - $\\hat{\\tau}_c = \\hat{b} = 50.0\\,\\mathrm{pN\\cdot nm}$.\n  - $\\hat{\\gamma}_{\\mathrm{int}} = -\\hat{m} - \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ext}} = -(-2.0) - 0.8 = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{pN\\cdot nm\\cdot s\\cdot rad^{-1}}$.\n- The internal dissipation fraction at $\\omega_{\\mathrm{eval}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{rad\\,s^{-1}}$ is:\n  - $f_{\\mathrm{int}}(10) = \\frac{1.2 \\times 10}{50.0} = \\frac{12}{50} = 0.24$.\n- The result vector, after rounding to $3$, $3$, and $6$ decimal places, is $[1.200, 50.000, 0.240000]$.\n\n**Dataset $2$**:\n- Given: $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ext}} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{pN\\cdot nm\\cdot s\\cdot rad^{-1}}$.\n- Data: $\\omega = [0, 6, 12, 18]\\,\\mathrm{rad\\,s^{-1}}$, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{out}} = [40, 28, 16, 4]\\,\\mathrm{pN\\cdot nm}$.\n- The data are perfectly linear.
