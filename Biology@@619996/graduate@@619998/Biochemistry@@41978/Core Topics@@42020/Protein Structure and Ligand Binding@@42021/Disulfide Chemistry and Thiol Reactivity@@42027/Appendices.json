It presents a standard equilibrium chemistry problem from the field of biochemistry, providing all necessary information for a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is therefore valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for three distinct tasks: first, to derive an expression for the mole fraction of thiolate; second, to compute this fraction at specific $\\mathrm{pH}$ values; and third, to interpret these results in the context of chemical reactivity. We will address these in order.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the mole fraction of thiolate, denoted as $f_{\\mathrm{RS^-}}$. The system is a monoprotic acid–base equilibrium for a cysteine side chain, represented by RSH:\n$$ \\mathrm{RSH} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{RS^-} + \\mathrm{H^+} $$\nThe acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, for this equilibrium is defined by the law of mass action. Assuming ideal behavior where activities are equal to concentrations, we have:\n$$ K_a = \\frac{[\\mathrm{RS^-}][\\mathrm{H^+}]}{[\\mathrm{RSH}]} $$\nHere, $[\\mathrm{RSH}]$ is the molar concentration of the protonated thiol, $[\\mathrm{RS^-}]$ is the molar concentration of the deprotonated thiolate anion, and $[\\mathrm{H^+}]$ is the molar concentration of hydrogen ions.\n\nThe mole fraction of the thiolate form, $f_{\\mathrm{RS^-}}$, is the ratio of the concentration of thiolate to the total concentration of cysteine side chains in both forms:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{RS^-}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{RS^-}]}{[\\mathrm{RSH}]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{RS^-}]}{[\\mathrm{RSH}] + [\\mathrm{RS^-}]} $$\nTo express $f_{\\mathrm{RS^-}}$ in terms of quantities related to $\\mathrm{pH}$ and $\\mathrm{p}K_a$, we first rearrange the $K_a$ expression to solve for $[\\mathrm{RSH}]$:\n$$ [\\mathrm{RSH}] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{RS^-}][\\mathrm{H^+}]}{K_a} $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[\\mathrm{RSH}]$ into the denominator of the mole fraction equation:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{RS^-}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{RS^-}]}{\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{RS^-}][\\mathrm{H^+}]}{K_a}\\right) + [\\mathrm{RS^-}]} $$\nThe term $[\\mathrm{RS^-}]$ is a common factor in the denominator and also appears in the numerator. It can be canceled, provided $[\\mathrm{RS^-}]$ is not zero, which is true for any finite $\\mathrm{pH}$:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{RS^-}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{[\\mathrm{H^+}]}{K_a} + 1} $$\nTo express this in terms of $\\mathrm{pH}$ and $\\mathrm{p}K_a$, we use their standard definitions:\n$$ \\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H^+}]) \\implies [\\mathrm{H^+}] = 10^{-\\mathrm{pH}} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{p}K_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a) \\implies K_a = 10^{-\\mathrm{p}K_a} $$\nSubstituting these into our expression for $f_{\\mathrm{RS^-}}$ gives:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{RS^-}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{10^{-\\mathrm{pH}}}{10^{-\\mathrm{p}K_a}} + 1} = \\frac{1}{10^{\\mathrm{p}K_a - \\mathrm{pH}} + 1} $$\nThis is the required expression for the mole fraction of thiolate in terms of $\\mathrm{pH}$ and $\\mathrm{p}K_a$. An equivalent and often useful form is obtained by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $10^{\\mathrm{pH}-\\mathrm{p}K_a}$:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{RS^-}} = \\frac{10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_a}}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - \\mathrm{p}K_a}} $$\nWe will use the first derived form for the calculations.\n\nSecond, we compute the value of $f_{\\mathrm{RS^-}}$ for a cysteine residue with $\\mathrm{p}K_a = 7.0$ at three different $\\mathrm{pH}$ values: $6.0$, $7.0$, and $8.0$.\n\nFor $\\mathrm{pH} = 6.0$:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{RS^-}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{7.0 - 6.0}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{1}} = \\frac{1}{11} \\approx 0.090909... $$\nRounded to four significant figures, this is $0.09091$.\n\nFor $\\mathrm{pH} = 7.0$:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{RS^-}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{7.0 - 7.0}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{0}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 1} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 $$\nTo four significant figures, this is $0.5000$. This result is expected, as when $\\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{p}K_a$, the concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base are equal.\n\nFor $\\mathrm{pH} = 8.0$:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{RS^-}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{7.0 - 8.0}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.1} = \\frac{1}{1.1} = \\frac{10}{11} \\approx 0.909090... $$\nRounded to four significant figures, this is $0.9091$.\n\nThird, we explain how the change in $f_{\\mathrm{RS^-}}$ informs the expected change in nucleophilicity for disulfide exchange. Disulfide exchange reactions, such as the attack of a cysteine on a disulfide bond, proceed via nucleophilic substitution. The attacking species is the thiolate anion, $\\mathrm{RS^-}$, which possesses a negative charge and is a significantly more potent nucleophile than the neutral, protonated thiol, $\\mathrm{RSH}$. The rate of such a reaction, under otherwise identical conditions (temperature, solvent, concentration of the disulfide substrate), is directly proportional to the concentration of the thiolate nucleophile, $[\\mathrm{RS^-}]$.\n\nThe mole fraction $f_{\\mathrm{RS^-}}$ represents the fraction of the total cysteine population that exists in the reactive thiolate form. Our calculations show that:\n- At $\\mathrm{pH} = 6.0$, only about $9.1\\%$ of the cysteine residues are in the nucleophilic thiolate form.\n- At $\\mathrm{pH} = 7.0$, this fraction increases to $50\\%$.\n- At $\\mathrm{pH} = 8.0$, the fraction further increases to about $90.9\\%$.\n\nTherefore, as the $\\mathrm{pH}$ increases from $6.0$ to $8.0$, the population of the active nucleophile, $\\mathrm{RS^-}$, increases by a factor of $(10/11) / (1/11) = 10$. Consequently, the rate of nucleophilic attack by the cysteine residue on a disulfide bond is expected to increase by approximately tenfold over this $\\mathrm{pH}$ range. The reactivity is low at $\\mathrm{pH}$ values significantly below the $\\mathrm{p}K_a$, rises steeply as the $\\mathrm{pH}$ approaches the $\\mathrm{p}K_a$, and begins to plateau at $\\mathrm{pH}$ values well above the $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ as $f_{\\mathrm{RS^-}}$ asymptotically approaches $1$. This demonstrates the critical role of $\\mathrm{pH}$ in modulating the chemical reactivity of ionizable residues in biological systems.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.09091 & 0.5000 & 0.9091\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2556882"}, {"introduction": "While pH determines the *potential* for reactivity, the local protein environment dictates the actual *rate* of reaction.
