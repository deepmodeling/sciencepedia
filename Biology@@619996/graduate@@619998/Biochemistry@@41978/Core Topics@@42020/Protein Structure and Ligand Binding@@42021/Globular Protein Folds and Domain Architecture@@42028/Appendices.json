{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A polypeptide's destiny—whether it collapses into a defined globular fold or remains a flexible disordered ensemble—is largely encoded in its primary sequence. This exercise asks you to predict the structural fate of a hypothetical polypeptide by analyzing its sequence composition and patterning. By calculating key biophysical parameters like mean hydropathy and net charge per residue, and by interpreting the structural implications of its alternating polarity, you will practice applying the foundational principles that connect sequence information to the emergence of three-dimensional protein architecture [@problem_id:2566878].", "problem": "You are given a hypothetical polypeptide of length $N=60$ residues designed to alternate strictly between hydrophobic and polar uncharged residues along the sequence. Specifically, positions $i=1, 3, 5, \\dots, 59$ are independently drawn from the hydrophobic set $\\{\\mathrm{V}, \\mathrm{I}, \\mathrm{L}, \\mathrm{F}, \\mathrm{M}\\}$, and positions $i=2, 4, 6, \\dots, 60$ are independently drawn from the polar uncharged set $\\{\\mathrm{S}, \\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{N}, \\mathrm{Q}\\}$. Assume dilute solution conditions at $pH 7.4$, $150\\,\\text{mM}$ sodium chloride, temperature $25\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$, and total protein concentration $ 10\\,\\mu\\text{M}$. No post-translational modifications, disulfide bonds, or cofactors are present.\n\nUse the following well-tested biophysical facts and definitions as your foundational base:\n\n- The hydrophobic effect is a primary driving force for globular protein folding; sequences with sufficiently high mean hydropathy and low electrostatic repulsion tend to form compact states. Conversely, sequences with low mean hydropathy and high net charge per residue often remain expanded and intrinsically disordered.\n- Mean hydropathy (for example, on the Kyte–Doolittle scale) correlates with the tendency to form a hydrophobic core. For the residue sets used here, the typical Kyte–Doolittle values are: $\\mathrm{V}: 4.2$, $\\mathrm{I}: 4.5$, $\\mathrm{L}: 3.8$, $\\mathrm{F}: 2.8$, $\\mathrm{M}: 1.9$, $\\mathrm{S}: -0.8$, $\\mathrm{T}: -0.7$, $\\mathrm{N}: -3.5$, $\\mathrm{Q}: -3.5$. Assume random selection within each set so that set means can be used to estimate the sequence mean.\n- Net charge per residue (NCPR) is defined as $\\mathrm{NCPR} = \\left|f_{+} - f_{-}\\right|$, where $f_{+}$ and $f_{-}$ are the fractions of positively and negatively charged residues, respectively, at the given pH.\n- Residue patterning statistics inform secondary structure tendencies. An alternating pattern in hydropathy or polarity produces a strong period-$2$ signal: the lag-$1$ autocorrelation of a binary hydropathy sequence $x_i \\in \\{+1,-1\\}$ (with $+1$ for hydrophobic and $-1$ for polar) is $C(1) = \\frac{1}{N-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} x_i x_{i+1}$, which approaches $-1$ for perfect alternation. The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) $X(\\omega) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i e^{- \\mathrm{i}\\, \\omega i}$ has a maximal power at $\\omega = \\pi$ for period-$2$ patterning, which is consistent with amphipathic $\\beta$-strands (side chains alternate sides along the strand every $1$ residue). In contrast, amphipathic $\\alpha$-helices show approximate period-$3$ to period-$4$ signals corresponding to $i, i+3$ or $i, i+4$ positioning on the helical wheel.\n\nUsing only the above base and first-principles reasoning, predict whether this sequence is more likely to adopt a compact globular fold or remain intrinsically disordered under the stated solution conditions. Justify your prediction quantitatively by estimating the mean hydropathy and qualitatively by evaluating the residue patterning statistics (autocorrelation and Fourier periodicity), and relate these to the formation of a hydrophobic core and secondary structure packing.\n\nChoose the single best option.\n\nA. The sequence is more likely to adopt a compact, $\\beta$-sheet-rich globular fold because it has moderate positive mean hydropathy with $\\mathrm{NCPR} \\approx 0$ and exhibits a strong period-$2$ hydropathy signal (negative lag-$1$ autocorrelation), which matches amphipathic $\\beta$-strands that can pack to bury hydrophobic side chains and expose polar ones.\n\nB. The sequence is more likely to remain intrinsically disordered because perfect alternation maximizes mixing of hydrophobic and polar residues, eliminating the hydrophobic effect; the negative lag-$1$ autocorrelation and $\\mathrm{NCPR} \\approx 0$ imply an expanded coil typical of disorder.\n\nC. The sequence is more likely to form an $\\alpha$-helical coiled coil because the alternating hydrophobic pattern aligns hydrophobic residues at positions $i$ and $i+3$ on an $\\alpha$-helix, producing the amphipathic interface required for coiled-coil assembly.\n\nD. The sequence is more likely to be soluble and monomeric but lack stable secondary structure because its mean hydropathy averages to approximately zero and no detectable periodicity is present in the hydropathy profile.", "solution": "The posed problem is subjected to validation before any attempt at a solution.\n\nStep 1: Extraction of Givens\n- Polypeptide length: $N=60$ residues.\n- Sequence composition: Positions $i=1, 3, 5, \\dots, 59$ are drawn from the hydrophobic set $\\{\\mathrm{V}, \\mathrm{I}, \\mathrm{L}, \\mathrm{F}, \\mathrm{M}\\}$.

It is well-posed, providing sufficient quantitative and qualitative information to derive a reasoned prediction. The terminology is precise and objective. The provided data (Kyte-Doolittle values, sequence composition rules) are consistent and physically realistic for a hypothetical protein design experiment. The problem does not violate any fundamental laws, is not trivial, and is properly structured for scientific analysis.\n\nStep 3: Verdict\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires a prediction of the structural state of the specified polypeptide. This is achieved by quantitatively evaluating its key sequence properties—mean hydropathy and net charge—and analyzing its residue patterning, as instructed.\n\n1.  **Mean Hydropathy Calculation**\n    The sequence is composed of $30$ hydrophobic (H) and $30$ polar (P) residues. We first calculate the mean Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy for each residue set.\n    For the hydrophobic set $\\{\\mathrm{V}, \\mathrm{I}, \\mathrm{L}, \\mathrm{F}, \\mathrm{M}\\}$:\n    $$ \\langle H_{\\text{hydrophobic}} \\rangle = \\frac{4.2 + 4.5 + 3.8 + 2.8 + 1.9}{5} = \\frac{17.2}{5} = 3.44 $$\n    For the polar uncharged set $\\{\\mathrm{S}, \\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{N}, \\mathrm{Q}\\}$:\n    $$ \\langle H_{\\text{polar}} \\rangle = \\frac{(-0.8) + (-0.7) + (-3.5) + (-3.5)}{4} = \\frac{-8.5}{4} = -2.125 $$\n    The overall mean hydropathy, $\\langle H_{\\text{total}} \\rangle$, for the entire sequence of length $N=60$ is the weighted average. Since there are equal numbers of residues from each set ($30$ each):\n    $$ \\langle H_{\\text{total}} \\rangle = \\frac{30 \\times \\langle H_{\\text{hydrophobic}} \\rangle + 30 \\times \\langle H_{\\text{polar}} \\rangle}{60} = \\frac{\\langle H_{\\text{hydrophobic}} \\rangle + \\langle H_{\\text{polar}} \\rangle}{2} $$\n    $$ \\langle H_{\\text{total}} \\rangle = \\frac{3.44 + (-2.125)}{2} = \\frac{1.315}{2} = 0.6575 $$\n    This is a moderately positive mean hydropathy. According to the provided principles, this favors a compact state driven by the hydrophobic effect, as opposed to an expanded, intrinsically disordered state which is typically associated with low (near-zero or negative) mean hydropathy.\n\n2.  **Net Charge per Residue (NCPR) Calculation**\n    The sequence is constructed exclusively from hydrophobic residues and polar uncharged residues. At $pH 7.4$, none of the side chains of these amino acids (V, I, L, F, M, S, T, N, Q) carry a net charge. Therefore, the fraction of positively charged residues, $f_{+}$, is $0$, and the fraction of negatively charged residues, $f_{-}$, is $0$.\n    $$ \\mathrm{NCPR} = |f_{+} - f_{-}| = |0 - 0| = 0 $$\n    An NCPR of $0$ signifies a complete lack of net electrostatic repulsion among the residues. High colloidal stability and a propensity for disorder are often linked to high NCPR. The value of $0$ is therefore highly permissive of chain collapse into a compact fold.\n\n3.  **Residue Patterning Analysis**\n    The sequence is defined by a strict alternation of hydrophobic and polar residues (H-P-H-P...). This is a perfect period-$2$ pattern.\n    - As stated in the problem description, this pattern results in a lag-$1$ autocorrelation $C(1)$ that approaches $-1$ and a maximal power in the DFT at frequency $\\omega = \\pi$. This confirms the presence of a strong, regular signal.\n    - The structural implication of this period-$2$ pattern is critical. In a polypeptide $\\beta$-strand, the side chains of successive residues ($i, i+1, i+2, \\dots$) point to opposite sides of the backbone plane. An alternating H-P-H-P... sequence thus perfectly generates an amphipathic $\\beta$-strand: all hydrophobic side chains are segregated to one face of the strand, and all polar side chains are segregated to the opposite face.\n    - Conversely, an $\\alpha$-helix has approximately $3.6$ residues per turn. To form an amphipathic helix, hydrophobic residues must be positioned, for example, at positions $i, i+3,$ and $i+4$. An alternating H-P-H-P... pattern does not satisfy this requirement; for instance, residue $i$ is H, but residue $i+3$ is P. Therefore, this sequence pattern is antithetical to the formation of stable, amphipathic $\\alpha$-helices.\n\n4.  **Integrated Conclusion**\n    The polypeptide possesses a positive mean hydropathy and zero net charge, both of which strongly favor collapse into a compact, globular structure over an intrinsically disordered state. The specific sequence pattern—a perfect period-$2$ alternation of hydrophobicity—pre-organizes the chain for the formation of highly amphipathic $\\beta$-strands. Such strands are the ideal building blocks for a stable globular fold, as they can pack together into a $\\beta$-sheet (e.g., a $\\beta$-barrel or sandwich) where the hydrophobic faces collectively form the protein's core, sequestered from solvent, while the polar faces remain exposed to the aqueous environment. This architecture maximally satisfies the hydrophobic effect.\n\nTherefore, the most logical prediction is that the sequence will adopt a compact, globular fold with a high content of $\\beta$-sheet secondary structure.\n\nEvaluation of Options:\n- **A. The sequence is more likely to adopt a compact, $\\beta$-sheet-rich globular fold because it has moderate positive mean hydropathy with $\\mathrm{NCPR} \\approx 0$ and exhibits a strong period-$2$ hydropathy signal (negative lag-$1$ autocorrelation), which matches amphipathic $\\beta$-strands that can pack to bury hydrophobic side chains and expose polar ones.**\nThis option aligns perfectly with our step-by-step analysis. The mean hydropathy is positive ($\\approx 0.66$), NCPR is $0$, and the period-$2$ signal is a direct consequence of the alternating sequence, which is architecturally suited for amphipathic $\\beta$-strands. The packing of these strands to form a hydrophobic core is the correct mechanism for folding.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n- **B. The sequence is more likely to remain intrinsically disordered because perfect alternation maximizes mixing of hydrophobic and polar residues, eliminating the hydrophobic effect; the negative lag-$1$ autocorrelation and $\\mathrm{NCPR} \\approx 0$ imply an expanded coil typical of disorder.**\nThis statement contains a fundamental error in reasoning. Perfect alternation on a polymer chain does not \"eliminate\" the hydrophobic effect; it provides a structural template to satisfy it with maximal efficiency through the formation of amphipathic secondary structures. It enables segregation in three-dimensional space. The conclusion of disorder is contradicted by the positive mean hydropathy and the strong ordering signal of the pattern.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **C. The sequence is more likely to form an $\\alpha$-helical coiled coil because the alternating hydrophobic pattern aligns hydrophobic residues at positions $i$ and $i+3$ on an $\\alpha$-helix, producing the amphipathic interface required for coiled-coil assembly.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect regarding helical geometry. In an alternating H-P-H-P sequence, if residue $i$ is hydrophobic (H), residue $i+3$ will be polar (P). This pattern is incompatible with the period-$3.6$ repeat of an $\\alpha$-helix required to form a hydrophobic face. The argument is flawed.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D. The sequence is more likely to be soluble and monomeric but lack stable secondary structure because its mean hydropathy averages to approximately zero and no detectable periodicity is present in the hydropathy profile.**\nThis statement makes two false claims. First, the mean hydropathy is not approximately zero; it is distinctly positive ($0.6575$). Second, the assertion that \"no detectable periodicity is present\" is diametrically opposed to the problem definition, which specifies a perfectly periodic sequence. This is a maximally detectable periodicity.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2566878"}, {"introduction": "Once a sequence commits to a folded pathway, it adopts specific local conformations known as secondary structures.

The total sensitivity $S_i$ is defined as the sum of a stability term $S_{\\text{stab},i}$ and an aggregation term $S_{\\text{agg},i}$.\n$$S_i = S_{\\text{stab},i} + S_{\\text{agg},i}$$\nWe are given the residue-specific parameters: hydrophobicity $H_i$, aggregation propensity $B_i$, and the number of occluding neighbors $n_i$. The provided data are:\n- $H_i$: $(4.5, -3.5, 4.2, -3.9, 3.8, -0.8, 2.8, -3.5, 3.8, -3.5, 4.2, -3.9)$ for $i=1, \\dots, 12$.\n- $B_i$: $(0.9, 0.1, 0.85, 0.1, 0.8, 0.2, 0.9, 0.1, 0.8, 0.1, 0.85, 0.1)$ for $i=1, \\dots, 12$.\n- $n_i$: $(4, 2, 4, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 4, 1, 4, 1)$ for $i=1, \\dots, 12$.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the fractional solvent exposure, $f_i$. The problem states that $f_i$ \"is the share allocated to solvent under isotropic competition with $n_i$ occluding neighbors.\" This implies that the surface of residue $i$ is contested by $n_i$ neighboring residues and one solvent entity. In an isotropic competition model, there are $n_i + 1$ total competitors for the surface, each receiving an equal share. Thus, the fractional exposure to the solvent is:\n$$f_i = \\frac{1}{n_i + 1}$$\nUsing the given values of $n_i$, we compute the vector of fractional exposures $f_i$:\n- $f_1 = \\frac{1}{4+1} = \\frac{1}{5}$\n- $f_2 = \\frac{1}{2+1} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n- $f_3 = \\frac{1}{4+1} = \\frac{1}{5}$\n- $f_4 = \\frac{1}{2+1} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n- $f_5 = \\frac{1}{5+1} = \\frac{1}{6}$\n- $f_6 = \\frac{1}{2+1} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n- $f_7 = \\frac{1}{5+1} = \\frac{1}{6}$\n- $f_8 = \\frac{1}{2+1} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n- $f_9 = \\frac{1}{4+1} = \\frac{1}{5}$\n- $f_{10} = \\frac{1}{1+1} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- $f_{11} = \\frac{1}{4+1} = \\frac{1}{5}$\n- $f_{12} = \\frac{1}{1+1} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nNext, we compute the two components of sensitivity. The stabilization sensitivity, $S_{\\text{stab},i}$, is given by $S_{\\text{stab},i} = k_s \\,\\max(H_i,0)\\,(1 - f_i)$ with $k_s=2$. This term is non-zero only for hydrophobic residues ($H_i  0$).\nThe aggregation sensitivity, $S_{\\text{agg},i}$, is given by $S_{\\text{agg},i} = k_a\\,B_i\\,f_i$ with $k_a=1$.\n\nWe now calculate $S_i$ for each residue $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 12\\}$.\n\nFor $i=1$: $H_1=4.5$, $B_1=0.9$, $f_1=\\frac{1}{5}$.\n$S_{\\text{stab},1} = 2 \\cdot \\max(4.5, 0) \\cdot (1 - \\frac{1}{5}) = 2 \\cdot 4.5 \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} = 7.2$.\n$S_{\\text{agg},1} = 1 \\cdot 0.9 \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} = 0.18$.\n$S_1 = 7.2 + 0.18 = 7.38$.\n\nFor $i=2$: $H_2=-3.5$, $B_2=0.1$, $f_2=\\frac{1}{3}$.\n$S_{\\text{stab},2} = 2 \\cdot \\max(-3.5, 0) \\cdot (1 - \\frac{1}{3}) = 0$.\n$S_{\\text{agg},2} = 1 \\cdot 0.1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{30}$.\n$S_2 = 0 + \\frac{1}{30} \\approx 0.033$.\n\nFor $i=3$: $H_3=4.2$, $B_3=0.85$, $f_3=\\frac{1}{5}$.\n$S_{\\text{stab},3} = 2 \\cdot \\max(4.2, 0) \\cdot (1 - \\frac{1}{5}) = 2 \\cdot 4.2 \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} = 6.72$.\n$S_{\\text{agg},3} = 1 \\cdot 0.85 \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} = 0.17$.\n$S_3 = 6.72 + 0.17 = 6.89$.\n\nFor $i=4$: $H_4=-3.9$, $B_4=0.1$, $f_4=\\frac{1}{3}$.\n$S_{\\text{stab},4} = 2 \\cdot \\max(-3.9, 0) \\cdot (1 - \\frac{1}{3}) = 0$.\n$S_{\\text{agg},4} = 1 \\cdot 0.1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{30}$.\n$S_4 = 0 + \\frac{1}{30} \\approx 0.033$.\n\nFor $i=5$: $H_5=3.8$, $B_5=0.8$, $f_5=\\frac{1}{6}$.\n$S_{\\text{stab},5} = 2 \\cdot \\max(3.8, 0) \\cdot (1 - \\frac{1}{6}) = 2 \\cdot 3.8 \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{19}{3}$.\n$S_{\\text{agg},5} = 1 \\cdot 0.8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{0.8}{6} = \\frac{2}{15}$.\n$S_5 = \\frac{19}{3} + \\frac{2}{15} = \\frac{95+2}{15} = \\frac{97}{15} \\approx 6.467$.\n\nFor $i=6$: $H_6=-0.8$, $B_6=0.2$, $f_6=\\frac{1}{3}$.\n$S_{\\text{stab},6} = 2 \\cdot \\max(-0.8, 0) \\cdot (1 - \\frac{1}{3}) = 0$.\n$S_{\\text{agg},6} = 1 \\cdot 0.2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{30} = \\frac{1}{15}$.\n$S_6 = 0 + \\frac{1}{15} \\approx 0.067$.\n\nFor $i=7$: $H_7=2.8$, $B_7=0.9$, $f_7=\\frac{1}{6}$.\n$S_{\\text{stab},7} = 2 \\cdot \\max(2.8, 0) \\cdot (1 - \\frac{1}{6}) = 2 \\cdot 2.8 \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{14}{3}$.\n$S_{\\text{agg},7} = 1 \\cdot 0.9 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{0.9}{6} = \\frac{3}{20}$.\n$S_7 = \\frac{14}{3} + \\frac{3}{20} = \\frac{280+9}{60} = \\frac{289}{60} \\approx 4.817$.\n\nFor $i=8$: $H_8=-3.5$, $B_8=0.1$, $f_8=\\frac{1}{3}$.\n$S_{\\text{stab},8} = 2 \\cdot \\max(-3.5, 0) \\cdot (1 - \\frac{1}{3}) = 0$.\n$S_{\\text{agg},8} = 1 \\cdot 0.1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{30}$.\n$S_8 = 0 + \\frac{1}{30} \\approx 0.033$.\n\nFor $i=9$: $H_9=3.8$, $B_9=0.8$, $f_9=\\frac{1}{5}$.\n$S_{\\text{stab},9} = 2 \\cdot \\max(3.8, 0) \\cdot (1 - \\frac{1}{5}) = 2 \\cdot 3.8 \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} = 6.08$.\n$S_{\\text{agg},9} = 1 \\cdot 0.8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} = 0.16$.\n$S_9 = 6.08 + 0.16 = 6.24$.\n\nFor $i=10$: $H_{10}=-3.5$, $B_{10}=0.1$, $f_{10}=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n$S_{\\text{stab},10} = 2 \\cdot \\max(-3.5, 0) \\cdot (1 - \\frac{1}{2}) = 0$.\n$S_{\\text{agg},10} = 1 \\cdot 0.1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 0.05$.\n$S_{10} = 0.05$.\n\nFor $i=11$: $H_{11}=4.2$, $B_{11}=0.85$, $f_{11}=\\frac{1}{5}$.\n$S_{\\text{stab},11} = 2 \\cdot \\max(4.2, 0) \\cdot (1 - \\frac{1}{5}) = 2 \\cdot 4.2 \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} = 6.72$.\n$S_{\\text{agg},11} = 1 \\cdot 0.85 \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} = 0.17$.\n$S_{11} = 6.72 + 0.17 = 6.89$.\n\nFor $i=12$: $H_{12}=-3.9$, $B_{12}=0.1$, $f_{12}=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n$S_{\\text{stab},12} = 2 \\cdot \\max(-3.9, 0) \\cdot (1 - \\frac{1}{2}) = 0$.\n$S_{\\text{agg},12} = 1 \\cdot 0.1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 0.05$.\n$S_{12} = 0.05$.\n\nWe compile the total sensitivity scores $S_i$:\n$S_1 = 7.38$\n$S_2 \\approx 0.033$\n$S_3 = 6.89$\n$S_4 \\approx 0.033$\n$S_5 \\approx 6.467$\n$S_6 \\approx 0.067$\n$S_7 \\approx 4.817$\n$S_8 \\approx 0.033$\n$S_9 = 6.24$\n$S_{10} = 0.05$\n$S_{11} = 6.89$\n$S_{12} = 0.05$\n\nTo find the residue index $i^{\\ast}$ with the maximum sensitivity, we compare the computed $S_i$ values.\n$$\\max(\\{S_i\\}) = \\max(7.38, 0.033, 6.89, 0.033, 6.467, 0.067, 4.817, 0.033, 6.24, 0.05, 6.89, 0.05) = 7.38$$\nThis maximum value corresponds to $i=1$.
