It is therefore deemed **valid**. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe objective is to find a relationship between $r$ and $B$. Let $n_{L}$ be the moles of bound ligand, $m_{\\text{prot}}$ be the mass of total protein, and $n_{\\text{rec}}$ be the moles of receptor macromolecule.\n\nFrom the given definitions:\n$$B = \\frac{n_{L}}{m_{\\text{prot}}}$$\n$$r = \\frac{n_{L}}{n_{\\text{rec}}}$$\n\nWe can express $n_{L}$ from the first equation as $n_{L} = B \\cdot m_{\\text{prot}}$ and substitute it into the second equation:\n$$r = \\frac{B \\cdot m_{\\text{prot}}}{n_{\\text{rec}}}$$\nThis expression shows that $r$ is proportional to $B$, with the conversion factor being the ratio of total protein mass to moles of receptor, $\\frac{m_{\\text{prot}}}{n_{\\text{rec}}}$. We must now evaluate this ratio.\n\nThe mass of the receptor, $m_{\\text{rec}}$, in a sample containing a total protein mass $m_{\\text{prot}}$ is given by the receptor mass fraction $p$:\n$$m_{\\text{rec}} = p \\cdot m_{\\text{prot}}$$\nThe moles of receptor, $n_{\\text{rec}}$, is related to its mass, $m_{\\text{rec}}$, by its molar mass, $M$:\n$$n_{\\text{rec}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{rec}}}{M} = \\frac{p \\cdot m_{\\text{prot}}}{M}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $n_{\\text{rec}}$ back into our equation for $r$:\n$$r = \\frac{B \\cdot m_{\\text{prot}}}{\\left(\\frac{p \\cdot m_{\\text{prot}}}{M}\\right)}$$\nThe term $m_{\\text{prot}}$, representing the arbitrary mass of total protein in a hypothetical sample, cancels out:\n$$r = B \\cdot \\frac{M}{p}$$\nThis derived relationship is of fundamental importance. It demonstrates that the fractional occupancy $r$ can be calculated from the specific binding $B$ using only the receptor's molecular weight $M$ and its mass fraction $p$. The result is independent of the amount of material used in the experiment, and therefore independent of the assay volume $V$ and the total protein concentration $C_{\\mathrm{prot}}$. These are parameters of a specific experimental instance, whereas $B$, $r$, $M$, and $p$ are intensive properties or constants of the system.\n\nWe now calculate the value of $r$ using the provided data. It is critical to maintain unit consistency.\n-   $B = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{pmol} \\cdot \\mathrm{mg}^{-1} = 0.25 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{mol} \\cdot (10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{g})^{-1} = 0.25 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{g}^{-1}$\n-   $M = 400\\,\\mathrm{kDa} = 400 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{g} \\cdot \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} = 4.0 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{g} \\cdot \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\n-   $p = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ (dimensionless, representing $\\mathrm{g}_{\\text{receptor}}/\\mathrm{g}_{\\text{total protein}}$)\n\nSubstitute these values into the derived formula:\n$$r = (0.25 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{mol}_{\\text{ligand}} \\cdot \\mathrm{g}_{\\text{prot}}^{-1}) \\cdot \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{g}_{\\text{rec}} \\cdot \\mathrm{mol}_{\\text{rec}}^{-1}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{g}_{\\text{rec}} \\cdot \\mathrm{g}_{\\text{prot}}^{-1}}$$\nThe units combine as $(\\mathrm{mol}_{\\text{ligand}}/\\mathrm{g}_{\\text{prot}}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{g}_{\\text{rec}}/\\mathrm{mol}_{\\text{rec}}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{g}_{\\text{prot}}/\\mathrm{g}_{\\text{rec}}) = \\mathrm{mol}_{\\text{ligand}}/\\mathrm{mol}_{\\text{rec}}$, which is the correct unit for $r$.\n\nPerforming the numerical calculation:\n$$r = \\frac{0.25 \\times 10^{-9} \\times 4.0 \\times 10^5}{2.0 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-4}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.50$$\nThus, $r = 0.50$ moles of ligand bound per mole of macromolecule.\n\nTo verify, we can use the extraneous information ($V$ and $C_{\\mathrm{prot}}$) to compute absolute quantities in the reaction tube.\n-   Total protein mass: $m_{\\text{prot,total}} = C_{\\mathrm{prot}} \\cdot V = (2.0\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}) \\cdot (0.10\\,\\mathrm{mL}) = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n-   Moles of bound ligand: $n_{L} = B \\cdot m_{\\text{prot,total}} = (0.25\\,\\mathrm{pmol/mg}) \\cdot (0.20\\,\\mathrm{mg}) = 0.050\\,\\mathrm{pmol}$.\n-   Mass of receptor: $m_{\\text{rec}} = p \\cdot m_{\\text{prot,total}} = (2.0 \\times 10^{-4}) \\cdot (0.20\\,\\mathrm{mg}) = 4.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n-   Moles of receptor: $n_{\\text{rec}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{rec}}}{M}$. We need $M$ in units of $\\mathrm{mg/pmol}$.\n    $M = 4.0 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{g/mol} = 4.0 \\times 10^5\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{mol}} \\times \\frac{10^3\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{1\\,\\mathrm{g}} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{mol}}{10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{pmol}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{mg/pmol}$.\n    $n_{\\text{rec}} = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{4.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{mg/pmol}} = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{pmol}$.\n-   Finally, compute $r$: $r = \\frac{n_{L}}{n_{\\text{rec}}} = \\frac{0.050\\,\\mathrm{pmol}}{0.10\\,\\mathrm{pmol}} = 0.50$.\nThis confirms the result and demonstrates explicitly that while $V$ and $C_{\\mathrm{prot}}$ can be used, they are not necessary.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options.\n\n**A. $r = 0.50$ per macromolecule; $r$ is independent of assay volume $V$ and total protein concentration $C_{\\mathrm{prot}}$.**\nOur calculation yields $r = 0.50$. Our derivation of the formula $r = B \\cdot M/p$ proves that $r$ is independent of $V$ and $C_{\\mathrm{prot}}$, as these are properties of the specific sample, not fundamental properties required for the conversion between two normalized measures of binding.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. $r = 0.125$ per macromolecule; $r$ is independent of assay volume $V$ and total protein concentration $C_{\\mathrm{prot}}$.**\nThe numerical value $r=0.125$ is incorrect. This value would be obtained if one were to erroneously use the subunit molecular weight ($100\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$) instead of the macromolecule molecular weight ($400\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$), as $0.50 / 4 = 0.125$. However, the problem defines $r$ with respect to the macromolecule.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $r = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ per macromolecule; $r$ depends on assay volume $V$.**\nThe numerical value is incorrect. Furthermore, the claim that $r$ depends on $V$ is false, as demonstrated by the derivation.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $r$ cannot be computed from the given information without additionally knowing $V$ and $C_{\\mathrm{prot}}$ because $B$ is normalized per mass rather than per tube.**\nThis statement is false. The conversion from $B$ (normalized per mass of total protein) to $r$ (normalized per mole of receptor) requires only the molecular weight of the receptor and its fractional mass, not the absolute quantities in the tube. The derivation $r = B \\cdot M/p$ proves that the calculation is possible with the given information, and that $V$ and $C_{\\mathrm{prot}}$ are superfluous.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2544762"}, {"introduction": "With data properly formatted, you can now use the classic Scatchard plot to extract key biophysical parameters from a binding isotherm.

The dissociation constant is defined by the law of mass action as $K_d = \\dfrac{[L][R]}{[LR]}$, where $[L]$ is the free ligand, $[R]$ is the free receptor, and $[LR]$ is the ligand-receptor complex. From these fundamentals, one can derive the single-site binding isotherm and the Scatchard representation. A Scatchard analysis plots $r/c$ versus $r$ and uses ordinary least squares to obtain a line whose slope is related to $K_d$. The primary goal of this problem is to quantify the uncertainty in the Scatchard-derived estimate of $K_d$ using two approaches: nonparametric bootstrap resampling and an asymptotic normal approximation obtained via the delta method.\n\nWrite a complete program that carries out the following steps for each parameter set in the test suite below.\n\n- Starting from the law of mass action and the definition of the dissociation constant, derive the single-site binding isotherm in terms of $B_{\\max}$, $K_d$, and $c$. Then, derive the linear Scatchard representation that relates $r/c$ to $r$ for a single-site system.\n- Use the derivation to implement a simulator that generates synthetic measurements of $r$ at specified ligand concentrations $c$. For a given $(B_{\\max}, K_d)$ and each concentration $c_i$, compute the noise-free bound $r_i$ predicted by the isotherm. Then generate $m$ independent replicate observations by adding independent, zero-mean, Gaussian noise with specified standard deviation (absolute units), and clip each noisy observation to the physically meaningful interval $\\left[0, B_{\\max}\\right]$. Average the $m$ replicates at each $c_i$ to obtain the final measured $r_i$ used in fitting. Use the fixed random seed $12345$ for reproducibility. All concentrations are in nanomolar units, but all requested outputs are dimensionless and must be printed without units.\n- From the averaged measurements $(c_i, r_i)$, construct the Scatchard data pairs $(x_i, y_i)$ with $x_i = r_i$ and $y_i = r_i / c_i$. Fit the linear model $y = \\alpha + s x$ by unweighted ordinary least squares to obtain the slope estimate $s$ and its standard error. Use only the properties of least squares and basic probability to implement this step.\n- Map the slope estimate to the dissociation constant estimate via the Scatchard relationship for a single site, and derive the asymptotic standard error for the $K_d$ estimate by the delta method applied to the slope. Construct a two-sided $95$ percent asymptotic normal confidence interval for $K_d$ using the normal quantile $z_{0.975} = 1.96$.\n- Implement a nonparametric bootstrap on the Scatchard dataset by resampling, with replacement, the index set of the paired points $(x_i, y_i)$ a total of $B$ times, each time refitting the line and mapping the slope to $K_d$ as above. Discard resamples that result in a nonnegative slope or a degenerate fit (zero variance in $x$), as such outcomes are incompatible with a single-site Scatchard interpretation. From the valid bootstrap replicates, compute the percentile $95$ percent confidence interval using the empirical $2.5$ and $97.5$ percent quantiles and also compute the sample skewness of the bootstrap $K_d$ distribution defined as the third central moment divided by the standard deviation cubed.\n- For each test case, compute and report the following three dimensionless quantities: \n    - the ratio of the bootstrap percentile interval width to the asymptotic normal interval width for $K_d$,\n    - the sample skewness of the bootstrap $K_d$ distribution,\n    - the fraction of bootstrap resamples that were discarded due to nonnegative slope or degeneracy.\n\nThe program must use the following constants and conventions:\n- Use the fixed random seed $12345$ to generate all random noise.\n- Use $m = 3$ replicates per concentration.\n- Use $B = 5000$ bootstrap resamples.\n- Use the two-sided normal quantile $z_{0.975} = 1.96$ when forming the asymptotic interval.\n- If fewer than $100$ valid bootstrap replicates remain after discarding invalid resamples, define the bootstrap interval width and the skewness as not-a-number and propagate accordingly.\n\nTest suite:\n- Case $1$ (general): $B_{\\max} = 100$, $K_d = 30$, concentrations $c$ in nanomolar given by $\\{1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300\\}$, Gaussian noise standard deviation $\\sigma = 5$ (same units as $r$).\n- Case $2$ (boundary, higher noise): $B_{\\max} = 100$, $K_d = 30$, the same concentrations as in Case $1$, Gaussian noise standard deviation $\\sigma = 12$.\n- Case $3$ (edge, fewer points, lower noise): $B_{\\max} = 100$, $K_d = 10$, concentrations $c$ in nanomolar given by $\\{5, 10, 20, 50, 200\\}$, Gaussian noise standard deviation $\\sigma = 2$.\n\nAll reported outputs are dimensionless. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results for the three cases as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each case contributes a three-element list in the order specified above. For example, the output must look like $[ [r_1, s_1, f_1], [r_2, s_2, f_2], [r_3, s_3, f_3] ]$, where $r_i$ is the bootstrap-to-normal width ratio, $s_i$ is the bootstrap skewness, and $f_i$ is the invalid bootstrap fraction for case $i$.", "solution": "The problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical equilibrium and mass action, and statistically sound, involving standard techniques such as ordinary least squares, the delta method, and bootstrap resampling. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and conditions specified, and is computationally feasible. It presents a relevant and non-trivial challenge in quantitative biophysical data analysis.\n\nWe begin by deriving the necessary theoretical relationships.\n\nThe system is a single-site ligand-receptor binding equilibrium: $L + R \\rightleftharpoons LR$.\n\nThe dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the law of mass action:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[L][R]}{[LR]}$$\nwhere $[L]$, $[R]$, and $[LR]$ are the equilibrium concentrations of free ligand, free receptor, and ligand-receptor complex, respectively.\n\nWe are given the following notation:\n- Free ligand concentration, $[L] = c$.\n- Bound ligand concentration, which is equivalent to the concentration of the ligand-receptor complex, $[LR] = r$.\n- Total receptor site concentration, $B_{\\max}$.\n\nThe total receptor concentration is the sum of free and bound receptors:\n$$B_{\\max} = [R] + [LR]$$\nFrom this, we can express the free receptor concentration as:\n$$[R] = B_{\\max} - r$$\n\nSubstituting these definitions into the expression for $K_d$:\n$$K_d = \\frac{c(B_{\\max} - r)}{r}$$\n\nTo derive the single-site binding isotherm, we solve this equation for $r$:\n$$K_d \\cdot r = c(B_{\\max} - r)$$\n$$K_d \\cdot r = c \\cdot B_{\\max} - c \\cdot r$$\n$$r(K_d + c) = c \\cdot B_{\\max}$$\n$$r = \\frac{B_{\\max} \\cdot c}{K_d + c}$$\nThis equation is the binding isotherm, which describes the bound ligand concentration $r$ as a function of the free ligand concentration $c$.\n\nTo derive the Scatchard representation, we rearrange the equation $K_d \\cdot r = c \\cdot B_{\\max} - c \\cdot r$ into a linear form. We divide by $c$:\n$$K_d \\frac{r}{c} = B_{\\max} - r$$\nRearranging to solve for the ratio $r/c$:\n$$\\frac{r}{c} = \\frac{B_{\\max}}{K_d} - \\frac{1}{K_d}r$$\nThis equation is in the linear form $y = \\alpha + sx$, where:\n- The dependent variable is $y = r/c$.\n- The independent variable is $x = r$.\n- The y-intercept is $\\alpha = B_{\\max}/K_d$.\n- The slope is $s = -1/K_d$.\n\nA Scatchard plot of $r/c$ versus $r$ should therefore yield a straight line. By fitting this line using unweighted ordinary least squares (OLS), we can estimate the slope $s$ and thereafter the dissociation constant $K_d$.\n\nFor a set of data points $(x_i, y_i)$, the OLS estimate for the slope, $\\hat{s}$, is given by:\n$$\\hat{s} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of data points, and $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$ are the sample means. The standard error of the slope estimate, $SE(\\hat{s})$, is:\n$$SE(\\hat{s}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_\\epsilon^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}}$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\sigma}_\\epsilon^2$ is the estimated variance of the residuals:\n$$\\hat{\\sigma}_\\epsilon^2 = \\frac{1}{n-2} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - (\\hat{\\alpha} + \\hat{s}x_i))^2$$\nThe intercept estimate is $\\hat{\\alpha} = \\bar{y} - \\hat{s}\\bar{x}$.\n\nFrom the estimated slope $\\hat{s}$, the dissociation constant is estimated as:\n$$\\hat{K}_d = -\\frac{1}{\\hat{s}}$$\nTo find the uncertainty in $\\hat{K}_d$, we use the delta method. For a function $g(s) = -1/s$, the variance of $\\hat{K}_d = g(\\hat{s})$ is approximated by:\n$$Var(\\hat{K}_d) \\approx [g'(\\hat{s})]^2 Var(\\hat{s})$$\nThe derivative is $g'(s) = 1/s^2$. Therefore:\n$$Var(\\hat{K}_d) \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{\\hat{s}^2}\\right)^2 Var(\\hat{s}) = \\frac{Var(\\hat{s})}{\\hat{s}^4}$$\nThe standard error of $\\hat{K}_d$ is the square root of the variance:\n$$SE(\\hat{K}_d) \\approx \\frac{SE(\\hat{s})}{\\hat{s}^2}$$\nA two-sided $95\\%$ asymptotic normal confidence interval for $K_d$ is then constructed as $\\hat{K}_d \\pm z_{0.975} \\cdot SE(\\hat{K}_d)$, with $z_{0.975} = 1.96$.\n\nFor the nonparametric bootstrap, we resample the set of paired data points $(x_i, y_i)$ with replacement $B$ times. For each bootstrap sample, we compute the slope estimate $\\hat{s}^*$ and the corresponding $\\hat{K}_d^* = -1/\\hat{s}^*$. Invalid samples (those yielding $\\hat{s}^* \\ge 0$ or a degenerate fit) are discarded. The `2.5`-th and `97.5`-th percentiles of the remaining valid $\\hat{K}_d^*$ values form the $95\\%$ bootstrap percentile confidence interval.\n\nThe sample skewness of the bootstrap distribution of $\\hat{K}_d^*$ is computed using the method of moments. For a set of $N_{valid}$ valid bootstrap estimates $\\{\\hat{K}_{d,j}^*\\}_{j=1}^{N_{valid}}$:\n$$\\text{Skewness} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{N_{valid}} \\sum_{j=1}^{N_{valid}} (\\hat{K}_{d,j}^* - \\bar{K}_d^*)^3}{\\left(\\frac{1}{N_{valid}} \\sum_{j=1}^{N_{valid}} (\\hat{K}_{d,j}^* - \\bar{K}_d^*)^2\\right)^{3/2}}$$\nwhere $\\bar{K}_d^*$ is the mean of the valid bootstrap estimates.\n\nThe program will execute these steps for each test case. It will first simulate noisy data according to the binding isotherm and specified noise model. Then, it will perform the Scatchard analysis, calculate the required statistics using both the asymptotic and bootstrap methods, and finally compute the specified output metrics: the ratio of bootstrap to asymptotic CI widths, the bootstrap skewness, and the fraction of discarded bootstrap samples.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run the simulation and analysis for all test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define constants from the problem statement\n    M_REPLICATES = 3\n    B_BOOTSTRAP = 5000\n    Z_VAL = 1.96\n    RANDOM_SEED = 12345\n    MIN_VALID_BOOTSTRAPS = 100\n\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"B_max\": 100.0, \"K_d\": 30.0,\n            \"concentrations\": np.array([1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300], dtype=float),\n            \"noise_std\": 5.0\n        },\n        {\n            \"B_max\": 100.0, \"K_d\": 30.0,\n            \"concentrations\": np.array([1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300], dtype=float),\n            \"noise_std\": 12.0\n        },\n        {\n            \"B_max\": 100.0, \"K_d\": 10.0,\n            \"concentrations\": np.array([5, 10, 20, 50, 200], dtype=float),\n            \"noise_std\": 2.0\n        }\n    ]\n\n    rng = np.random.default_rng(RANDOM_SEED)\n    results = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        # Step 1: Simulate experimental data\n        B_max = case[\"B_max\"]\n        K_d_true = case[\"K_d\"]\n        c_values = case[\"concentrations\"]\n        noise_std = case[\"noise_std\"]\n\n        r_measured = []\n        for c in c_values:\n            r_true = (B_max * c) / (K_d_true + c)\n            noise = rng.normal(loc=0.0, scale=noise_std, size=M_REPLICATES)\n            noisy_replicates = r_true + noise\n            clipped_replicates = np.clip(noisy_replicates, 0, B_max)\n            r_measured.append(np.mean(clipped_replicates))\n        r_measured = np.array(r_measured)\n\n        # Step 2: Construct Scatchard data and perform OLS\n        x_data = r_measured\n        y_data = r_measured / c_values\n\n        def fit_ols(x, y):\n            n = len(x)\n            if n <= 2:\n                return np.nan, np.nan\n\n            x_mean, y_mean = np.mean(x), np.mean(y)\n            S_xx = np.sum((x -
