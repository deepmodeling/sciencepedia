To confirm, digest with sucrase (invertase) and expect quantitative hydrolysis to glucose and fructose and disappearance of the $m/z \\, 365$ ion.\n\nD. $D$ is cellobiose; the failed $2$-AB labeling resulted because sodium cyanoborohydride reduced the free aldehyde before imine formation due to incorrect order of addition. To confirm, perform the imine formation step at pH $10$ to accelerate iminium formation and then add the reductant, which should yield a strong fluorescent product at the retention time of cellobiose.", "solution": "The problem requires the identification of an unknown disaccharide, $D$, based on a series of analytical experiments, and an evaluation of proposed explanations and follow-up experiments. I will first validate the problem statement and then proceed to a systematic analysis of the provided data to deduce the structure of $D$.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\n**Extraction of Givens:**\n-   **Analyte:** Disaccharide $D$.\n-   **MALDI-TOF-MS:** Dominant ion at $m/z \\, 365.105$ ($[\\text{M} + \\text{Na}]^{+}$), corresponding to a neutral mass $\\mathrm{M} \\approx 342$ $\\mathrm{Da}$.\n-   **HPAEC-PAD:** A single peak with retention time between that of maltose and cellobiose.\n-   **Reductive Amination:** Reaction with $2$-aminobenzamide ($2$-AB) and sodium cyanoborohydride fails to produce a fluorescent product. A maltose control succeeds under identical conditions.\n-   **Enzymatic Assays:**\n    -   Trehalase: Quantitative conversion of $D$ to two equivalents of glucose.\n    -   Sucrase: No hydrolysis.\n    -   $\\alpha$-glucosidase (maltase): No hydrolysis.\n    -   $\\beta$-glucosidase: Negligible hydrolysis ($<5\\%$ in $24$ $\\mathrm{h}$).\n-   **$^1\\text{H}$ NMR:** Two anomeric proton doublets at $\\delta \\, 5.20$ $\\mathrm{ppm}$ ($J_{1,2} = 3.6\\ \\text{Hz}$) and $\\delta \\, 5.15$ $\\mathrm{ppm}$ ($J_{1,2} = 3.8\\ \\text{Hz}$). Absence of anomeric signals near $\\delta \\, 4.5$ $\\mathrm{ppm}$ with $J_{1,2} \\approx 7-8\\ \\text{Hz}$.\n\n**Validation Verdict:**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent.\n1.  **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is based on established principles of carbohydrate chemistry and standard analytical techniques (MS, NMR, chromatography, enzymatic assays). The provided definitions and data values are realistic.\n2.  **Consistency:** The mass data ($M \\approx 342$ $\\mathrm{Da}$) is consistent with a di-hexose, $\\text{C}_{12}\\text{H}_{22}\\text{O}_{11}$. The enzymatic data (hydrolysis by trehalase to glucose) confirms it is a diglucoside with an $\\alpha,\\alpha\\text{-}1,1$ linkage. The NMR data (small $J_{1,2}$ couplings) confirms the $\\alpha$-anomeric configuration for both glucose units. The failure of reductive amination is consistent with a non-reducing sugar, which an $\\alpha,\\alpha\\text{-}1,1$ linkage creates. No contradictions are present.\n3.  **Completeness:** The information is sufficient to uniquely identify the disaccharide.\n\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Solution\n\nI will integrate the given information to determine the identity of disaccharide $D$.\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry:** The observed ion $[\\text{M} + \\text{Na}]^{+}$ at $m/z \\, 365.105$ implies a neutral mass $M \\approx 365.105 - 22.990 = 342.115\\ \\text{Da}$. This mass is in excellent agreement with the theoretical exact mass of a hexose disaccharide, $\\text{C}_{12}\\text{H}_{22}\\text{O}_{11}$, which is $342.116\\ \\text{Da}$. This suggests $D$ is composed of two hexose units.\n\n2.  **Enzymatic Assays:** This is the most definitive set of data for structural elucidation.\n    -   The quantitative hydrolysis of $D$ by **trehalase** into two equivalents of glucose is unambiguous. Trehalase is highly specific for $\\alpha$-D-glucopyranosyl-($1\\leftrightarrow1$)-$\\alpha$-D-glucopyranoside (trehalose). This single experiment strongly indicates that $D$ is trehalose.\n    -   The lack of hydrolysis by **sucrase** rules out sucrose ($\\alpha$-glucose-($1\\leftrightarrow2$)-$\\beta$-fructose).\n    -   The lack of hydrolysis by **$\\alpha$-glucosidase (maltase)** rules out an $\\alpha$-$1,4$ linkage, hence $D$ is not maltose.\n    -   The negligible hydrolysis by **$\\beta$-glucosidase** rules out common $\\beta$-linked disaccharides of glucose, such as cellobiose ($\\beta$-$1,4$).\n\n3.  **$^1\\text{H}$ NMR Spectroscopy:** The NMR data provides stereochemical confirmation.\n    -   A disaccharide has two anomeric carbons. The spectrum shows two anomeric proton signals. The small coupling constants, $J_{1,2} = 3.6\\ \\text{Hz}$ and $J_{1,2} = 3.8\\ \\text{Hz}$, are characteristic of an axial-equatorial relationship between the H-1 and H-2 protons on a pyranose ring in the standard $^4C_1$ chair conformation. This geometry corresponds to an **$\\alpha$-anomeric configuration**.\n    -   The absence of any doublet with a large coupling constant ($J_{1,2} \\approx 7-8\\ \\text{Hz}$), which would be characteristic of a **$\\beta$-anomer**, confirms that no $\\beta$-linkages are present.\n    -   Thus, both glucose units are in the $\\alpha$ configuration. This is perfectly consistent with the structure of $\\alpha,\\alpha\\text{-}1,1$-trehalose.\n\n4.  **Reductive Amination:**\n    -   Reductive amination with $2$-AB requires the carbohydrate to be a **reducing sugar**, meaning it must possess a free hemiacetal group that can exist in equilibrium with an open-chain aldehyde form.\n    -   The structure of trehalose, $\\alpha$-D-glucopyranosyl-($1\\leftrightarrow1$)-$\\alpha$-D-glucopyranoside, involves a glycosidic bond between the anomeric carbons of both glucose units (C-1 and C-1'). Consequently, neither ring can open, and the molecule is **non-reducing**.\n    -   The failure of $D$ to be labeled by $2$-AB is therefore the expected result for trehalose. It is not an experimental failure but a correct negative result that provides crucial structural information. The success of the maltose control (which is a reducing sugar) confirms the validity of the experimental procedure.\n\n**Conclusion:** All evidence converges to one single, inescapable conclusion: the disaccharide $D$ is trehalose.\n\n### Step 3: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $D$ is $\\alpha,\\alpha$-$1,1$-linked trehalose, a non-reducing disaccharide of two glucose units; the failure of $2$-AB labeling is expected because no free anomeric aldehyde exists. To confirm, digest $D$ with trehalase and verify disappearance of the $m/z \\, 365$ ion concomitant with appearance of glucose and loss of the disaccharide peak by HPAEC-PAD.**\n-   **Statement Evaluation:** This option correctly identifies $D$ as trehalose and accurately explains the result of the reductive amination experiment as a consequence of trehalose being a non-reducing sugar. This reconciles all data.\n-   **Confirmatory Step Evaluation:** The proposed confirmation by trehalase digestion followed by MS and HPAEC-PAD analysis is a valid and standard method to verify the identity. Although this experiment was already described in the problem givens, its proposal as a confirmatory step is scientifically sound and directly tests the proposed structure.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option provides the correct identification and a sound explanation for all observations.\n\n**B. $D$ is maltose; the failed $2$-AB labeling arose from inadvertent contamination of the labeling cocktail with sodium borohydride ($\\text{NaBH}_4$), which reduced the aldehyde to an alditol prior to imine formation. To confirm, repeat labeling with freshly prepared reagents and expect a strong fluorescent product at the retention time of maltose.**\n-   **Statement Evaluation:** The identification as maltose is incorrect. It is directly contradicted by the enzymatic data ($\\alpha$-glucosidase/maltase does not hydrolyze $D$) and the NMR data (absence of a $\\beta$-anomeric signal from the reducing end).\n-   **Explanation Evaluation:** The proposed experimental error is contradicted by the fact that the maltose control experiment, run under \"identical conditions,\" was successful. If the reagents were contaminated, the control would also have failed.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $D$ is sucrose; the failed $2$-AB labeling reflects its non-reducing character. To confirm, digest with sucrase (invertase) and expect quantitative hydrolysis to glucose and fructose and disappearance of the $m/z \\, 365$ ion.**\n-   **Statement Evaluation:** The identification as sucrose is incorrect. The problem explicitly states that sucrase does not hydrolyze $D$. Furthermore, the trehalase digestion yielded two equivalents of glucose, not one glucose and one fructose. While sucrose is indeed non-reducing, the core identification is wrong.\n-   **Confirmatory Step Evaluation:** The proposed confirmatory experiment (digestion with sucrase) was already performed and yielded a negative result, disproving the hypothesis.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $D$ is cellobiose; the failed $2$-AB labeling resulted because sodium cyanoborohydride reduced the free aldehyde before imine formation due to incorrect order of addition. To confirm, perform the imine formation step at pH $10$ to accelerate iminium formation and then add the reductant, which should yield a strong fluorescent product at the retention time of cellobiose.**\n-   **Statement Evaluation:** The identification as cellobiose is incorrect. It is contradicted by the NMR data, which shows only $\\alpha$-anomeric protons (small $J$-couplings) and no $\\beta$-anomeric protons (large $J$-couplings). It is also contradicted by the enzymatic data (negligible digestion by $\\beta$-glucosidase but complete digestion by trehalase).\n-   **Explanation Evaluation:** The explanation of labeling failure is chemically flawed. Sodium cyanoborohydride ($\\text{NaCNBH}_3$) is specifically used because it is a weak reductant that does not readily reduce aldehydes at the pH used for reductive amination (typically pH 4–6), but rapidly reduces the more electrophilic protonated imine (Schiff base). Again, the success of the maltose control invalidates this claim of experimental error.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\nFinal conclusion based on analysis is that option A is the only one that is consistent with all the facts presented.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2556532"}, {"introduction": "After determining a single carbohydrate structure, a natural next step is to appreciate the enormous diversity that complex carbohydrates can achieve. This exercise is a thought experiment in combinatorial chemistry, asking you to systematically count the total number of unique disaccharides possible from a small set of modified monosaccharide building blocks. By working through the rules of glycosidic bond formation, anomericity, and ring structure, you will develop a quantitative feel for the immense coding capacity of glycans [@problem_id:2556528], which underpins their diverse biological roles.", "problem": "A biochemist is cataloging all possible oxygen-glycosidic (O-glycosidic) disaccharides that can be built from a set of three D-hexose-derived monosaccharides under a simplified but scientifically realistic structural model. The three monosaccharides are: D-glucose (Glc), N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc), and D-glucuronic acid (GlcA). Assume the following foundational biochemical facts and constraints, and use only these as your starting point:\n\n- A glycosidic bond is an acetal linkage formed when the anomeric hydroxyl at carbon $C1$ (the hemiacetal carbon) of a donor monosaccharide reacts with a hydroxyl group on an acceptor monosaccharide to form an O-glycosidic bond.\n- A D-hexose can cyclize to either a six-membered ring (pyranose) or a five-membered ring (furanose). In the pyranose, ring closure involves the hydroxyl at $C5$, making the ring oxygen originate from $O5$; in the furanose, ring closure involves the hydroxyl at $C4$, making the ring oxygen originate from $O4$. In both cases, a new anomeric hydroxyl appears at $C1$ in the cyclic hemiacetal, which can be either $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$.\n- Hydroxyl-bearing carbons capable of acting as acceptor sites are precisely those carbons that bear free hydroxyl groups in the cyclic form, including the anomeric hydroxyl at $C1$. The set of hydroxyl-bearing positions differs between pyranose and furanose because of which hydroxyl participates in ring formation.\n- Substitutions that remove hydroxyl groups eliminate those positions as O-glycosyl acceptor sites. Specifically: GlcNAc has $C2$ substituted by an acetamido group (no hydroxyl at $C2$), and GlcA has $C6$ oxidized to a carboxylate (no hydroxyl at $C6$). All other positions retain their normal hydroxyls for a D-hexose, except the position used for ring formation ($C5$ in the pyranose, $C4$ in the furanose). No other modifications are present.\n- Only O-glycosidic linkages are allowed. Ignore any N- or C-glycosidic linkages and any additional derivatizations such as phosphorylation or sulfation.\n- A disaccharide is represented as an oriented pair “donor $\\to$ acceptor,” where the donor contributes its anomeric carbon $C1$ to form the glycosidic bond. The donor is specified by its monosaccharide identity, its ring size (pyranose or furanose), and its anomeric configuration ($\\alpha$ or $\\beta$) at $C1$. The acceptor is specified by its monosaccharide identity, its ring size (pyranose or furanose), and the position that bears the hydroxyl to which the glycosidic oxygen is attached. If the acceptor hydroxyl is the anomeric hydroxyl at $C1$, then the acceptor’s anomeric configuration at $C1$ is also fixed by the glycosidic bond and can be either $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$, giving distinct structures.\n- Two disaccharides are considered distinct if they differ in any of the following: donor monosaccharide identity, donor ring size, donor anomeric configuration, acceptor monosaccharide identity, acceptor ring size, acceptor linkage position (which carbon on the acceptor), or, when the acceptor position is $C1$, the acceptor anomeric configuration. The oriented nature of the pair means reversing donor and acceptor yields a different disaccharide.\n- Consider only D-series monosaccharides and ignore mutarotation equilibria of free reducing ends; count each fixed configuration as a distinct structure.\n\nUsing only the above facts and constraints, compute the total number of distinct oriented O-glycosidic disaccharides that can be formed when the donor and the acceptor are each chosen independently from the set $\\{\\text{Glc}, \\text{GlcNAc}, \\text{GlcA}\\}$. Express your final answer as an integer with no units.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, formally coherent, and well-posed. It presents a combinatorial enumeration problem based on established principles of carbohydrate chemistry. No invalidating flaws are present. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the total number of distinct oriented O-glycosidic disaccharides that can be formed from a given set of three monosaccharides. An oriented disaccharide is defined as a \"donor $\\to$ acceptor\" pair. According to the problem's criteria for distinctness and the independence of choices for the donor and acceptor moieties, the total number of distinct disaccharides, $N_{total}$, can be calculated as the product of the number of possible donor configurations, $N_{donor}$, and the total number of possible acceptor linkage configurations, $L_{total}$.\n\n$$N_{total} = N_{donor} \\times L_{total}$$\n\nFirst, we determine the number of distinct donor configurations, $N_{donor}$. A donor is specified by three independent properties:\n1.  Monosaccharide identity: There are $3$ choices: D-glucose (Glc), N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc), or D-glucuronic acid (GlcA).\n2.  Ring size: There are $2$ choices for a hexose: pyranose (a $6$-membered ring) or furanose (a $5$-membered ring).\n3.  Anomeric configuration at the glycosidic bond: There are $2$ choices: $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$.\n\nThe number of possible donor configurations is the product of the number of choices for each property:\n$$N_{donor} = 3 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 12$$\n\nNext, we determine the total number of acceptor linkage configurations, $L_{total}$. This quantity is the sum of all possible linkage options over all possible acceptor molecules. An acceptor molecule is defined by its monosaccharide identity and its ring size. There are $3$ choices for identity and $2$ for ring size, resulting in $3 \\times 2 = 6$ unique acceptor molecule types.\n\nFor each acceptor molecule type, we must count the number of available hydroxyl groups that can participate in forming a glycosidic bond. The problem states that if the linkage is at the anomeric carbon ($C1$), both $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ configurations of the newly formed glycosidic bond result in distinct structures. Therefore, the anomeric hydroxyl at $C1$ provides $2$ linkage options, while any other hydroxyl provides $1$ option.\n\nLet us analyze the number of available hydroxyls for each of the $6$ acceptor molecule types.\n\n1.  **D-glucose (Glc)**: This is an unmodified D-hexose.\n    *   **Pyranose form (Glcp)**: Ring formation involves the hydroxyl at $C5$. The available hydroxyls are at positions $C1$, $C2$, $C3$, $C4$, and $C6$. There is $1$ anomeric hydroxyl ($C1$) and $4$ non-anomeric hydroxyls. The number of linkage options is $ (1 \\times 2) + 4 = 6$.\n    *   **Furanose form (Glcf)**: Ring formation involves the hydroxyl at $C4$. The available hydroxyls are at positions $C1$, $C2$, $C3$, $C5$, and $C6$. There is $1$ anomeric hydroxyl ($C1$) and $4$ non-anomeric hydroxyls. The number of linkage options is $ (1 \\times 2) + 4 = 6$.\n\n2.  **N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc)**: The hydroxyl at $C2$ is replaced by an acetamido group.\n    *   **Pyranose form (GlcNAcp)**: The available hydroxyls for a generic hexopyranose are at $\\{C1, C2, C3, C4, C6\\}$. The substitution at $C2$ removes it from this set. The available hydroxyls are at $\\{C1, C3, C4, C6\\}$. There is $1$ anomeric hydroxyl ($C1$) and $3$ non-anomeric hydroxyls. The number of linkage options is $ (1 \\times 2) + 3 = 5$.\n    *   **Furanose form (GlcNAcf)**: The available hydroxyls for a generic hexofuranose are at $\\{C1, C2, C3, C5, C6\\}$. The substitution at $C2$ removes it. The available hydroxyls are at $\\{C1, C3, C5, C6\\}$. There is $1$ anomeric hydroxyl ($C1$) and $3$ non-anomeric hydroxyls. The number of linkage options is $ (1 \\times 2) + 3 = 5$.\n\n3.  **D-glucuronic acid (GlcA)**: The hydroxymethyl group at $C6$ is oxidized to a carboxylate group, removing the hydroxyl.\n    *   **Pyranose form (GlcAp)**: The available hydroxyls for a generic hexopyranose are at $\\{C1, C2, C3, C4, C6\\}$. The oxidation at $C6$ removes it. The available hydroxyls are at $\\{C1, C2, C3, C4\\}$. There is $1$ anomeric hydroxyl ($C1$) and $3$ non-anomeric hydroxyls. The number of linkage options is $ (1 \\times 2) + 3 = 5$.\n    *   **Furanose form (GlcAf)**: The available hydroxyls for a generic hexofuranose are at $\\{C1, C2, C3, C5, C6\\}$. The oxidation at $C6$ removes it. The available hydroxyls are at $\\{C1, C2, C3, C5\\}$. There is $1$ anomeric hydroxyl ($C1$) and $3$ non-anomeric hydroxyls. The number of linkage options is $ (1 \\times 2) + 3 = 5$.\n\nNow, we sum the linkage options for all possible acceptor molecules to find $L_{total}$:\n$$L_{total} = (\\text{options for Glcp}) + (\\text{options for Glcf}) + (\\text{options for GlcNAcp}) + (\\text{options for GlcNAcf}) + (\\text{options for GlcAp}) + (\\text{options for GlcAf})$$\n$$L_{total} = 6 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 32$$\n\nFinally, we compute the total number of distinct disaccharides by multiplying the number of donor configurations by the total number of acceptor linkage configurations:\n$$N_{total} = N_{donor} \\times L_{total} = 12 \\times 32$$\n$$N_{total} = 384$$\n\nTherefore, there are $384$ distinct oriented O-glycosidic disaccharides that can be formed under the given constraints.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{384}$$", "id": "2556528"}, {"introduction": "A primary goal of glycobiology is to connect the vast structural diversity of polysaccharides to their physical and functional properties.

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of polymer solution theory, namely the Mark–Houwink–Sakurada relation, which it extends using a linear free-energy relationship framework. The problem is well-posed: it provides a sufficient number of calibration data points ($N=8$) to estimate the number of unknown model parameters ($p=6$), rendering the system overdetermined and suitable for Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation. All data and definitions required for a unique solution are provided, and no contradictions or ambiguities are present. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and we shall proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\nThe task is to estimate the coefficient vector $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = (\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_3, \\beta_4, \\beta_5)^{\\top}$ for the linear model:\n$$\n\\ln[\\eta] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\ln n + \\beta_2 b + \\beta_3 r_{\\alpha} + \\beta_4 \\phi_{1\\to 6} + \\beta_5 e\n$$\nwhere $e = 1/n$. This can be expressed in matrix form as a linear system $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$.\n\nFor each of the $i=1, \\dots, 8$ calibration samples, we define the response variable $y_i = \\ln([\\eta]_i)$ and the feature vector $\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\top}$ as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\top} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\ln n_i & b_i & r_{\\alpha,i} & \\phi_{1\\to 6,i} & e_i \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe full system is composed of the $8 \\times 1$ response vector $\\mathbf{y}$ and the $8 \\times 6$ design matrix $\\mathbf{X}$, whose rows are the individual feature vectors $\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\top}$. The OLS method finds the estimate $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ that minimizes the sum of squared residuals, $SSR = \\sum_{i=1}^{N}(y_i - \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\beta})^2 = (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta})^{\\top}(\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta})$.\n\nThe solution to this minimization problem is given by the normal equations:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{X}^{\\top}\\mathbf{X})\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = \\mathbf{X}^{\\top}\\mathbf{y}\n$$\nAssuming the matrix $\\mathbf{X}^{\\top}\\mathbf{X}$ is non-singular, the unique solution for the coefficient vector is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^{\\top}\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^{\\top}\\mathbf{y}\n$$\nFor superior numerical stability, we avoid direct computation of the inverse and instead solve the least-squares problem using methods such as QR decomposition, which are standard in numerical linear algebra libraries.\n\nThe implementation steps are as follows:\n1.  Construct the design matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ and response vector $\\mathbf{y}$ from the $8$ calibration samples. The entries of $\\mathbf{X}$ are the feature values $(1, \\ln n, b, r_\\alpha, \\phi_{1\\to 6}, 1/n)$, and the entries of $\\mathbf{y}$ are the values of $\\ln[\\eta]$.\n2.  Solve the system $\\mathbf{X}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = \\mathbf{y}$ for $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ in the least-squares sense. This yields the numerical values for the coefficients $\\beta_0, \\dots, \\beta_5$.\n3.  For each of the $5$ test cases, construct a new feature vector, $\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{test}}$.\n4.  Use the estimated coefficient vector $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ to predict the logarithmic intrinsic viscosity for each test case: $\\ln[\\eta]_{\\text{pred}} = \\mathbf{x}_{\\text{test}}^{\\top}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$.\n5.  Transform the prediction back to the original scale by exponentiation: $[\\eta]_{\\text{pred}} = \\exp(\\ln[\\eta]_{\\text{pred}})$.\n6.  Round the final predicted values $[\\eta]_{\\text{pred}}$ to three decimal places as required.\n\nThis procedure provides a systematic and reproducible method to solve the problem based on fundamental statistical principles.
