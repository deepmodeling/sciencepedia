It is bulkier than a hydrogen atom, leading to increased steric hindrance compared to glycine. This results in a larger excluded volume and a smaller allowed fraction.\n- **Proline**: Is unique, as its aliphatic side chain is cyclic and covalently bonded to the backbone nitrogen atom. This pyrrolidine ring structure severely restricts rotation about the N-C$_{\\alpha}$ bond (the $\\phi$ angle).

The peptide bond has substantial partial double-bond character, constraining it to be nearly planar with $\\omega$ distributed strongly near the trans value $+\\pi$ (approximately $180^{\\circ}$) and only rarely near the cis value $0$ (approximately $0^{\\circ}$). The Ramachandran plot records the distribution of the $(\\phi,\\psi)$ torsions and is shaped primarily by local steric exclusion, yielding allowed basins and disallowed regions.\n\nConsider a modeled protein segment in which a single peptide bond between residue $i$ and residue $i+1$ has been mistakenly modeled as cis (i.e., $\\omega_i \\approx 0$) when the true conformation is trans (i.e., $\\omega_i \\approx \\pi$).

From first principles (planarity of the peptide bond and the geometric definitions of $\\phi_i$, $\\psi_i$, and $\\omega_i$), reason about how such a false cis assignment can lead to a cluster of Ramachandran outliers localized to adjacent residues, and how this error would manifest in the histogram of $\\omega$ values collected over the entire model.\n\nWhich of the following statements best captures the mechanistic consequence and a robust histogram-based diagnostic of this error?\n\nA. If $\\omega_i$ is incorrectly set near $0$ while $\\mathrm{C}_{\\alpha,i}$ and $\\mathrm{C}_{\\alpha,i+1}$ remain fixed, the peptide plane is flipped relative to the trans geometry. To preserve the local $\\mathrm{C}_{\\alpha}$–$\\mathrm{C}_{\\alpha}$ separation, the backbone must compensate by rotating $\\psi_i$ and $\\phi_{i+1}$ by approximately $\\pm \\pi$, which tends to place $(\\phi_i,\\psi_i)$ and $(\\phi_{i+1},\\psi_{i+1})$ into disallowed Ramachandran regions, creating a local cluster of outliers at residues $i$ and $i+1$. In an $\\omega$ histogram over all peptide bonds, this error generates a narrow secondary peak near $\\omega \\approx 0$, especially suspicious if those $\\omega \\approx 0$ cases occur at non-proline residues.\n\nB.

This constitutes a change $\\Delta \\omega_i \\approx -\\pi$ radians (or $-180^{\\circ}$). In the *trans* state, the two alpha-carbons, $\\mathrm{C}_{\\alpha,i}$ and $\\mathrm{C}_{\\alpha,i+1}$, are on opposite sides of the peptide bond plane, separated by a distance of approximately $3.8$ Å. In the *cis* state, they are on the same side, and the distance shortens to approximately $2.9$ Å, assuming ideal bond lengths and angles.\n\nThe critical constraint is that the positions of $\\mathrm{C}_{\\alpha,i}$ and $\\mathrm{C}_{\\alpha,i+1}$ remain \"nearly fixed\", as dictated by experimental data. This means the vector connecting $\\mathrm{C}_{\\alpha,i}$ to $\\mathrm{C}_{\\alpha,i+1}$ must be preserved. A flip of $\\omega_i$ from $\\pi$ to $0$ profoundly alters this vector. To restore the vector to its original state, the modeling software must introduce compensatory rotations in the other available torsional degrees of freedom, which are the flanking angles $\\psi_i$ and $\\phi_{i+1}$.\n\nGeometrically, a change of $\\Delta\\omega_i \\approx -\\pi$ can be approximately compensated by changes $\\Delta\\psi_i \\approx +\\pi$ and $\\Delta\\phi_{i+1} \\approx +\\pi$. This combination of three rotations, each by $\\approx \\pi$, acts as a \"crankshaft\" motion that preserves the relative positions of atoms further away, critically including $\\mathrm{C}_{\\alpha,i}$ and $\\mathrm{C}_{\\alpha,i+1}$. Specifically, if the true conformation is $(\\psi_i^\\text{true}, \\omega_i^\\text{true} \\approx \\pi, \\phi_{i+1}^\\text{true})$, the erroneously refined model will converge to a state close to $(\\psi_i^\\text{true}+\\pi, \\omega_i^\\text{model} \\approx 0, \\phi_{i+1}^\\text{true}+\\pi)$.\n\nThis compensatory change has a direct effect on the Ramachandran plot. A rotation of a dihedral angle by $\\pi$ ($180^{\\circ}$) will almost certainly move it from an allowed conformational basin (e.g., $\\alpha$-helix or $\\beta$-sheet) to a sterically disallowed region.\n1.  For residue $i$, its conformation is described by the pair $(\\phi_i, \\psi_i)$. The error forces $\\psi_i$ to change by $\\approx \\pi$. The resulting pair $(\\phi_i, \\psi_i+\\pi)$ is highly likely to be a Ramachandran outlier.\n2.  For residue $i+1$, its conformation is described by $(\\phi_{i+1}, \\psi_{i+1})$. The error forces $\\phi_{i+1}$ to change by $\\approx \\pi$. The resulting pair $(\\phi_{i+1}+\\pi, \\psi_{i+1})$ is also highly likely to be a Ramachandran outlier.\nThus, a single false *cis* peptide bond at position $i$ induces a characteristic local cluster of two Ramachandran outliers at the flanking residues, $i$ and $i+1$.\n\nFor the histogram-based diagnostic, one must consider the distribution of all $\\omega$ values in the protein model.\n- A correct model will show a very large, sharp peak near $\\omega \\approx \\pi$ ($180^{\\circ}$), representing the vast majority of *trans* peptide bonds.\n- A much smaller, secondary peak may exist near $\\omega \\approx 0$, corresponding to genuine *cis* peptide bonds. These are rare but are significantly enriched in Xaa-Proline sequences (where Xaa is any amino acid).\n- An incorrect *cis* assignment, as described in the problem, will contribute one entry to the $\\omega \\approx 0$ bin. If this is a systematic error in a low-resolution structure, multiple such errors will generate a noticeable secondary peak near $\\omega=0$. The key to identifying this peak as artifactual is to check the identity of the residue at position $i+1$. If the peak is dominated by non-proline *cis* bonds, it is highly suspicious and indicative of modeling error.\n\nWith this foundation, we can evaluate each option.\n\nA.

It correctly deduces this leads to a cluster of Ramachandran outliers at residues $i$ and $i+1$. Finally, it correctly notes that this error appears in an $\\omega$ histogram as a secondary peak near $0$, and that suspicion is warranted if these are non-proline residues.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nB. This statement is fundamentally incorrect. The claim that a single false *cis* assignment cannot create more than one outlier is false, as demonstrated above. The reasoning provided, that $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ are independent of $\\omega$ \"by definition,\" is a fallacy. While they are independent variables, their values are coupled by the physical and geometric constraints of the polypeptide chain, especially under the condition of fixed atom positions. The claim that the $\\omega$ histogram remains unimodal is also false, as a *cis* assignment by definition populates the region around $\\omega \\approx 0$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nC. This statement describes an entirely different phenomenon. A broadening of the main *trans* peak near $\\omega \\approx \\pi$ indicates strained peptide bonds that deviate from perfect planarity, but are still *trans*. A *cis* assignment is a discrete isomeric state near $\\omega \\approx 0$, not a continuous broadening of the *trans* state. The claim of \"no discernible population near $\\omega \\approx 0$\" directly contradicts the nature of a *cis* bond.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nD. This statement provides an accurate and practical description of the histogram-based diagnostic. It correctly states that true *cis* bonds are enriched at Xaa-Pro sequences, so a *cis*-proline peak is often genuine. It then correctly contrasts this with the situation in low-resolution models, where a non-proline *cis* peak is a strong indicator of systematic modeling errors. Finally, it correctly connects these errors to Ramachandran outliers concentrated in the two flanking residues ($i$ and $i+1$). This statement is complementary to Option A, focusing more on the practical validation aspect.\n**Verdict: Correct**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2596600"}]}
