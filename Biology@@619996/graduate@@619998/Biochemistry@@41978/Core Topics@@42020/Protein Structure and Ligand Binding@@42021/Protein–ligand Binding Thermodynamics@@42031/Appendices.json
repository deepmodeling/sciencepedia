To achieve this, we must first solve for the unknown equilibrium concentration $[PL]$.\n\nWe substitute the expressions for $[P]$ and $[L]$ into the definition of $K_d$:\n$$K_d = \\frac{(P_t - [PL])(L_t - [PL])}{[PL]}$$\nThis equation relates the unknown $[PL]$ to the known parameters. We rearrange this equation into a standard quadratic form, $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where the variable is $x = [PL]$.\n$$K_d [PL] = (P_t - [PL])(L_t - [PL])$$\n$$K_d [PL] = P_t L_t - P_t [PL] - L_t [PL] + [PL]^2$$\n$$[PL]^2 - (P_t + L_t)[PL] - K_d [PL] + P_t L_t = 0$$\n$$[PL]^2 - (P_t + L_t + K_d)[PL] + P_t L_t = 0$$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation for $[PL]$ with coefficients $a=1$, $b=-(P_t + L_t + K_d)$, and $c=P_t L_t$.

As $K_d > 0$, this implies $[PL]_+ > P_t$. This violates the physical constraint that the complex concentration cannot exceed the total protein concentration.\n\nConsider the case where $L_t > P_t$.

The numerator of $[PL]_+$ becomes:\n$$(P_t + L_t + K_d) + \\sqrt{\\dots} > (P_t + L_t + K_d) + (L_t - P_t) = 2L_t + K_d$$\nTherefore, $[PL]_+ > \\frac{2L_t + K_d}{2} = L_t + \\frac{K_d}{2}$. This implies $[PL]_+ > L_t$, which violates the physical constraint that complex concentration cannot exceed total ligand concentration.\n\nIn all cases, the '$+$' root yields a non-physical result.
