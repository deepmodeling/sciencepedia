We must proceed strictly from the provided fundamental bases.\n\nThe first principle states that the observed mean residue ellipticity, $[\\theta]_{222}^{\\mathrm{obs}}$, is a linear combination of the contributions from the constituent secondary structures. For a simplified two-state model consisting of an $\\alpha$-helical ($H$) fraction and a non-helical ($NH$) fraction, this relationship is expressed as:\n$$[\\theta]_{222}^{\\mathrm{obs}} = f_{\\mathrm{H}} [\\theta]_{222, \\mathrm{H}} + f_{\\mathrm{NH}} [\\theta]_{222, \\mathrm{NH}}$$\nwhere $f_{\\mathrm{H}}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{NH}}$ are the mole fractions of residues in helical and non-helical conformations, and $[\\theta]_{222, \\mathrm{H}}$ and $[\\theta]_{222, \\mathrm{NH}}$ are the characteristic mean residue ellipticities for pure helical and pure non-helical ensembles, respectively.\n\nThe sum of mole fractions must be equal to $1$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{H}} + f_{\\mathrm{NH}} = 1$$\nThis allows us to express $f_{\\mathrm{NH}}$ in terms of $f_{\\mathrm{H}}$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{NH}} = 1 - f_{\\mathrm{H}}$$\nSubstituting this into the primary equation gives:\n$$[\\theta]_{222}^{\\mathrm{obs}} = f_{\\mathrm{H}} [\\theta]_{222, \\mathrm{H}} + (1 - f_{\\mathrm{H}}) [\\theta]_{222, \\mathrm{NH}}$$\nThe second principle states that the contribution from the non-helical ensemble at $\\lambda = 222\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ is negligible. This is a critical simplification, which we formalize by setting the characteristic ellipticity of the non-helical state to zero relative to the helical signal:\n$$[\\theta]_{222, \\mathrm{NH}} \\approx 0$$\nApplying this approximation simplifies the expression significantly:\n$$[\\theta]_{222}^{\\mathrm{obs}} \\approx f_{\\mathrm{H}} [\\theta]_{222, \\mathrm{H}} + (1 - f_{\\mathrm{H}})(0)$$\n$$[\\theta]_{222}^{\\mathrm{obs}} \\approx f_{\\mathrm{H}} [\\theta]_{222, \\mathrm{H}}$$\nThe problem provides the reference value for a fully helical protein, $[\\theta]_{222}^{100\\%}$.

I shall first validate the problem statement and then proceed to a solution based on first principles of biophysical chemistry.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   **Protein:** A small, single-domain enzyme with a tightly packed hydrophobic core and a solvent-exposed surface.\n-   **Mutation:** Threonine (Thr) is mutated to Valine (Val).\n-   **Site X (Core):**\n    -   The Thr side chain is in the protein core.\n    -   The Thr hydroxyl group donates one intramolecular hydrogen bond to a buried backbone carbonyl.\n    -   Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA) is less than $5$ Å$^2$ (essentially fully buried).\n-   **Site Y (Surface):**\n    -   The Thr side chain is on the protein surface.\n    -   SASA is greater than $60$ Å$^2$ (fully solvent-exposed).\n    -   The Thr side chain makes multiple transient hydrogen bonds to water in the folded state.\n-   **Assumptions:**\n    1.  The unfolded state is highly solvated for both wild-type (WT) and mutant.\n    2.  The global protein fold does not rearrange upon mutation.\n    3.  No new water penetrates the core at site X after the mutation.\n    4.  Side-chain volumes of threonine and valine are similar, avoiding large cavities or steric clashes.\n-   **Definitions:**\n    -   Folding free energy: $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}} = G_{\\mathrm{folded}} - G_{\\mathrm{unfolded}}$.\n    -   Change in folding free energy upon mutation: $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$. A positive $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$ signifies destabilization.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly rooted in established principles of protein chemistry, including the hydrophobic effect, hydrogen bonding, and protein stability. The scenario described is a classic and realistic problem in protein engineering and biophysics. Threonine and Valine are natural amino acids, and their differing properties (polar hydroxyl group vs. nonpolar isopropyl group) are well-characterized.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides a clear, self-contained setup. The initial state, the mutation, the locations, and crucial simplifying assumptions are all explicitly stated, allowing for a deductive, qualitative analysis. A unique conclusion based on physicochemical reasoning is possible.\n-   **Objectivity:** The language is technical and precise, using standard terminology such as SASA and $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and free from internal contradictions or fatal flaws. It is a valid problem. I will now proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\n\nWe must analyze the change in the free energy of folding, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$, for the threonine (Thr) to valine (Val) mutation at two distinct sites. The governing equation is:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = (G_{\\mathrm{folded}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} - G_{\\mathrm{unfolded}}^{\\mathrm{mut}}) - (G_{\\mathrm{folded}}^{\\mathrm{WT}} - G_{\\mathrm{unfolded}}^{\\mathrm{WT}})\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to compare the effects on the folded and unfolded states separately:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}} = (G_{\\mathrm{folded}}^{\\mathrm{Val}} - G_{\\mathrm{folded}}^{\\mathrm{Thr}}) - (G_{\\mathrm{unfolded}}^{\\mathrm{Val}} - G_{\\mathrm{unfolded}}^{\\mathrm{Thr}})\n$$\n\n**Analysis of the Mutation at Site X (Core)**\n\n1.  **Effect on the Folded State ($G_{\\mathrm{folded}}^{\\mathrm{Val}} - G_{\\mathrm{folded}}^{\\mathrm{Thr}}$):**\n    -   In the wild-type (WT) protein, the buried threonine's hydroxyl group forms a specific, intramolecular hydrogen bond with a backbone carbonyl. This is a highly favorable enthalpic interaction, contributing significantly to protein stability. The strength of this H-bond is enhanced by the low dielectric constant ($\\epsilon$) of the protein core.\n    -   Upon mutation to valine, this hydrogen bond is eliminated. Valine's side chain is purely aliphatic and cannot act as a hydrogen bond donor.\n    -   Crucially, the problem states that no new water molecule penetrates the core. This means the backbone carbonyl, which was previously satisfied by the threonine hydroxyl, becomes an \"unsatisfied\" or \"unpaired\" polar group within a nonpolar environment. This is extremely energetically unfavorable, resulting in a large positive enthalpy change.\n    -   Valine is slightly more hydrophobic than threonine. Placing a more hydrophobic residue in the core provides a small, favorable contribution from the hydrophobic effect. However, the energy penalty from losing a buried hydrogen bond and creating an unsatisfied polar group is far greater in magnitude. Empirically, such changes are known to cost several kcal/mol (e.g., $10-25$ kJ/mol).\n    -   Therefore, the folded state of the mutant is substantially less stable than the WT: $G_{\\mathrm{folded}}^{\\mathrm{Val}} \\gg G_{\\mathrm{folded}}^{\\mathrm{Thr}}$, and the term $(G_{\\mathrm{folded}}^{\\mathrm{Val}} - G_{\\mathrm{folded}}^{\\mathrm{Thr}})$ is large and positive.\n\n2.  **Effect on the Unfolded State ($G_{\\mathrm{unfolded}}^{\\mathrm{Val}} - G_{\\mathrm{unfolded}}^{\\mathrm{Thr}}$):**\n    -   In the unfolded state, both side chains are fully solvated by water. Threonine is more hydrophilic than valine due to its polar hydroxyl group, which can form hydrogen bonds with water. Valine is more hydrophobic.\n    -   Consequently, threonine is more stable in an aqueous environment than valine. This means the free energy of the unfolded valine polypeptide is higher than that of the threonine polypeptide: $G_{\\mathrm{unfolded}}^{\\mathrm{Val}} > G_{\\mathrm{unfolded}}^{\\mathrm{Thr}}$.\n    -   The term $(G_{\\mathrm{unfolded}}^{\\mathrm{Val}} - G_{\\mathrm{unfolded}}^{\\mathrm{Thr}})$ is therefore positive, reflecting the greater hydrophobicity of valine.\n\n3.  **Net Effect on Stability ($\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$):**\n    -   $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}} = (\\text{Large Positive Term}) - (\\text{Small Positive Term})$.\n    -   The dominant contribution is the large energetic penalty in the folded state. The difference in solvation free energy in the unfolded state is a smaller effect.\n    -   The net result is a large, positive $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$, indicating a significant destabilization of the protein.\n\n**Analysis of the Mutation at Site Y (Surface)**\n\n1.  **Effect on the Folded State ($G_{\\mathrm{folded}}^{\\mathrm{Val}} - G_{\\mathrm{folded}}^{\\mathrm{Thr}}$):**\n    -   In the WT protein, the surface-exposed threonine is fully solvated and forms favorable hydrogen bonds with water molecules.\n    -   Upon mutation to valine, these favorable protein-water hydrogen bonds are lost. The valine side chain is nonpolar and cannot form them. Instead, it creates a small hydrophobic patch on the protein surface. The surrounding water molecules must organize into ordered \"cages\" around this patch, which is entropically unfavorable for the solvent.\n    -   Both effects—loss of favorable H-bonds and introduction of an unfavorable hydrophobic patch—make the folded state of the mutant slightly less stable than the WT. Thus, $G_{\\mathrm{folded}}^{\\mathrm{Val}} > G_{\\mathrm{folded}}^{\\mathrm{Thr}}$, and the term $(G_{\\mathrm{folded}}^{\\mathrm{Val}} - G_{\\mathrm{folded}}^{\\mathrm{Thr}})$ is positive, but small.\n\n2.  **Effect on the Unfolded State ($G_{\\mathrm{unfolded}}^{\\mathrm{Val}} - G_{\\mathrm{unfolded}}^{\\mathrm{Thr}}$):**\n    -   This term is identical to the one analyzed for site X. The unfolded states are assumed to be the same regardless of the mutation's position. As established, $G_{\\mathrm{unfolded}}^{\\mathrm{Val}} > G_{\\mathrm{unfolded}}^{\\mathrm{Thr}}$, and this term is positive.\n\n3.  **Net Effect on Stability ($\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$):**\n    -   For a surface residue, the environment in the folded state (solvated) is very similar to the environment in the unfolded state (solvated).\n    -   The change in free energy upon swapping Thr for Val on the surface, $(G_{\\mathrm{folded}}^{\\mathrm{Val}} - G_{\\mathrm{folded}}^{\\mathrm{Thr}})$, is approximately equal to the change in solvation free energy in the unfolded state, $(G_{\\mathrm{unfolded}}^{\\mathrm{Val}} - G_{\\mathrm{unfolded}}^{\\mathrm{Thr}})$.\n    -   Therefore, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}} = (G_{\\mathrm{folded}}^{\\mathrm{Val}} - G_{\\mathrm{folded}}^{\\mathrm{Thr}}) - (G_{\\mathrm{unfolded}}^{\\mathrm{Val}} - G_{\\mathrm{unfolded}}^{\\mathrm{Thr}}) \\approx 0$.\n    -   However, the replacement of a polar side chain with a nonpolar one on the surface is generally found to be slightly destabilizing. The loss of specific favorable interactions (H-bonds to water) and the introduction of a nonpolar group to the solvent makes the folded state slightly less favorable relative to the unfolded state.\n    -   Thus, we expect a small, positive $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$, indicating mild destabilization.\n\n**Structural Consequences:**\nThe problem states that the side-chain volumes are similar and the global fold is maintained. This implies that any structural changes will be highly localized, likely involving minor adjustments in the side-chain dihedral angles (rotameric states) to optimize local packing, without significant perturbation of the backbone or overall architecture.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Core site X: $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$ is positive and large (destabilizing) because the buried hydrogen bond is lost and the buried carbonyl becomes unsatisfied; side-chain packing changes are minor due to similar size. Surface site Y: $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$ is positive and small (mildly destabilizing) because favorable water hydrogen bonds are lost and a hydrophobic patch is introduced; no major structural change beyond local rotamer adjustment.**\n-   **Site X Analysis:** This statement is fully consistent with my derivation. The magnitude of $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$ is correctly identified as \"positive and large,\" and the reason given—loss of the buried H-bond leading to an unsatisfied polar group—is the correct dominant factor.\n-   **Site Y Analysis:** This statement is also fully consistent. The magnitude is correctly identified as \"positive and small,\" and the reasons given—loss of H-bonds to water and creation of a hydrophobic patch—are correct. The structural consequences are also accurately described.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Core site X: $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$ is negative (stabilizing) because valine is more hydrophobic and better suited for the core; surface site Y: $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$ is negative (stabilizing) because valine reduces desolvation penalties at the surface; in both cases the mutation improves packing and stability.**\n-   **Site X Analysis:** This is incorrect. It ignores the huge energetic penalty of breaking a buried H-bond, which far outweighs the small favorable contribution from increased hydrophobicity. The mutation is strongly destabilizing.\n-   **Site Y Analysis:** This is incorrect. A surface threonine is already well-solvated; there is no large \"desolvation penalty\" to reduce. Replacing a polar group with a nonpolar group on the surface is unfavorable, not stabilizing.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Core site X: $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$ is approximately zero because threonine and valine are both $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$-branched with similar volume; surface site Y: $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$ is negative (stabilizing) because hydrophobic side chains prefer solvent exposure, increasing entropy of water.**\n-   **Site X Analysis:** This is incorrect. While the properties mentioned are relevant to packing, they are secondary to the massive energy change from the lost hydrogen bond. $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$ will be far from zero.\n-   **Site Y Analysis:** This statement is fundamentally flawed. Hydrophobic side chains do not \"prefer solvent exposure\"; this is the opposite of the hydrophobic effect. Exposure of nonpolar groups to water *decreases* solvent entropy. The mutation is destabilizing, not stabilizing.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Core site X: $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$ is positive but small because any lost hydrogen bonding is offset by improved hydrophobic packing; surface site Y: $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$ is approximately zero because surface substitutions are generally energetically neutral; structural consequences are negligible at both sites.**\n-   **Site X Analysis:** This is incorrect. It correctly identifies the sign of $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$ but drastically underestimates its magnitude. The energy of a buried H-bond is not \"offset\" by minor improvements in hydrophobicity; the penalty is large.\n-   **Site Y Analysis:** \"Approximately zero\" is a reasonable first approximation, but \"positive and small\" is a more precise and accurate description for replacing a polar residue with a nonpolar one on the surface. Option A's explanation is more complete. The primary error lies in the analysis of site X.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2592978"}]}
