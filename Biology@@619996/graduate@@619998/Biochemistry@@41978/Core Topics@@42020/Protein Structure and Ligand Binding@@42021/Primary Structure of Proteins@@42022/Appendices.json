Amino acid analysis reveals its composition to be one residue each of Alanine (A), Glycine (G), Leucine (L), Phenylalanine (F), Lysine (K), and Valine (V). To determine its primary structure, two separate enzymatic digestion experiments are performed.\n\n**Experiment 1: Trypsin Digestion**\nThe hexapeptide is treated with trypsin. Trypsin is a protease that specifically cleaves peptide bonds on the C-terminal side of positively charged residues, namely Lysine (K) and Arginine (R), provided the following residue is not Proline. This digestion results in the formation of two smaller peptide fragments: a dipeptide and a tetrapeptide. The sequences of these fragments are determined to be Ala-Leu and Val-Gly-Phe-Lys.\n\n**Experiment 2: Chymotrypsin Digestion**\nA separate sample of the original hexapeptide is treated with chymotrypsin. Chymotrypsin is a protease that cleaves peptide bonds on the C-terminal side of large aromatic residues, such as Phenylalanine (F), Tryptophan (W), and Tyrosine (Y), provided the following residue is not Proline. This digestion also yields two fragments, both of which are tripeptides. Their sequences are determined to be Val-Gly-Phe and Lys-Ala-Leu.\n\nBased on these results, deduce the complete primary sequence of the original hexapeptide.

The trypsin digestion produces two peptides: a dipeptide Ala-Leu and a tetrapeptide Val-Gly-Phe-Lys. Since trypsin cleaves on the C-terminal side of Lys, the fragment that ends in Lys must be the N-terminal fragment containing the Lys at its C-terminus. Therefore, the tetrapeptide Val-Gly-Phe-Lys must be the N-terminal portion. The remaining dipeptide Ala-Leu must be the C-terminal portion that follows the cleavage site. Hence, the intact sequence consistent with trypsin cleavage is\nVal-Gly-Phe-Lys-Ala-Leu.\n\nTo confirm, we use the chymotrypsin result. Chymotrypsin cleaves on the C-terminal side of Phe. In the sequence Val-Gly-Phe-Lys-Ala-Leu, cleavage after Phe yields two tripeptides: Val-Gly-Phe and Lys-Ala-Leu, which exactly match the observed fragments. This consistency confirms that the unique primary sequence is Val-Gly-Phe-Lys-Ala-Leu.\n\nExpressed in one-letter codes from N-terminus to C-terminus, the sequence is VGFKAL.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{VGFKAL}$$", "id": "2064548"}, {"introduction": "Modern proteomics demands extraordinary precision, and mass spectrometry is the central tool for achieving it.

You will develop an optimal fragmentation strategy by balancing the costs of synthesis and ligation, a task that merges chemical principles with strategic and computational thinking to solve a real-world problem in synthetic biology. [@problem_id:2064518]", "problem": "In the field of chemical protein synthesis, Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) is a cornerstone technique for assembling large polypeptides from smaller, synthetically accessible peptide fragments. The process involves the reaction between a peptide with a C-terminal thioester and a second peptide with an N-terminal Cysteine residue, forming a native peptide bond at the ligation site.\n\nTo synthesize a hypothetical 20-amino-acid signal-modulating peptide, \"Signalin-20\", you must devise an optimal fragmentation strategy. The primary sequence of Signalin-20, from N-terminus to C-terminus, is:\n\n`M-Y-G-V-A-C-K-L-P-G-F-Y-S-P-C-N-G-H-F-V`\n\nYour task is to determine the optimal way to break this sequence into smaller fragments for synthesis. The total cost of the synthesis is the sum of the costs for synthesizing each fragment plus any costs associated with the ligations. The cost parameters are defined in arbitrary \"cost units\" as follows:\n\n1.  **Fragment Synthesis Cost**: The cost to synthesize a single peptide fragment of length $L$ amino acids using Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) is given by the formula $C_{synth} = L^2$.\n2.  **Ligation Site Requirements**: A ligation can only occur at an `Xaa-Cys` junction, meaning the N-terminal residue of a fragment (except for the very first fragment of the protein) must be Cysteine.\n3.  **Ligation & Mutation Costs**:\n    *   If a native Cysteine (C) is already present at a desired ligation site, the cost for the ligation step ($C_{lig}$) is 10 units.\n    *   To create a new ligation site, a native Glycine (G) residue can be mutated to a Cysteine. This incurs a mutation cost ($C_{mut}$) of 5 units in addition to the standard ligation cost. Thus, the total cost at a `G`-to-`C` site is $C_{lig} + C_{mut} = 15$ units.\n    *   No other amino acids can be used to create a ligation site.\n\nYou need to find the fragmentation strategy that minimizes the total synthesis cost.
