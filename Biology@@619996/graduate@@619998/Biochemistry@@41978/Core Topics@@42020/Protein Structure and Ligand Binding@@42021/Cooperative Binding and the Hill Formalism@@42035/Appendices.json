It is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for a rigorous derivation. We proceed.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the fractional saturation $Y([L])$ for a homodimeric protein with two equivalent ligand binding sites. We must start from fundamental principles of chemical equilibrium.\n\nThe system consists of three protein species: the free protein $P$, the singly ligated protein $PL$, and the doubly ligated protein $PL_2$. The equilibria between these species are described by the law of mass action using the given macroscopic association constants $K_1$ and $K_2$.\n\nThe first equilibrium is:\n$$P + L \\rightleftharpoons PL$$\nThe corresponding association constant $K_1$ is defined as:\n$$K_1 = \\frac{[PL]}{[P][L]}$$\nFrom this, we express the concentration of the singly ligated species $[PL]$ in terms of the free protein concentration $[P]$ and the free ligand concentration $[L]$:\n$$[PL] = K_1 [P] [L]$$\n\nThe second equilibrium is:\n$$PL + L \\rightleftharpoons PL_2$$\nThe corresponding association constant $K_2$ is defined as:\n$$K_2 = \\frac{[PL_2]}{[PL][L]}$$\nFrom this, we express the concentration of the doubly ligated species $[PL_2]$:\n$$[PL_2] = K_2 [PL] [L]$$\nWe can substitute the expression for $[PL]$ from the first equilibrium into this equation to relate $[PL_2]$ directly to $[P]$ and $[L]$:\n$$[PL_2] = K_2 (K_1 [P] [L]) [L] = K_1 K_2 [P] [L]^2$$\n\nThe problem defines fractional saturation $Y([L])$ as the average number of bound ligands per protein, $\\nu([L])$, divided by the total number of sites, $n=2$. The quantity $\\nu([L])$ is calculated by taking the weighted average of the number of ligands bound to each protein species, where the weighting factors are the mole fractions of each species.\nThe total concentration of protein in all forms is $[P]_{total} = [P] + [PL] + [PL_2]$.\nThe total concentration of bound ligand is given by the sum of ligands on each species: $1 \\cdot [PL] + 2 \\cdot [PL_2]$.\nThus, the average number of bound ligands per protein molecule is:\n$$\\nu([L]) = \\frac{1 \\cdot [PL] + 2 \\cdot [PL_2]}{[P] + [PL] + [PL_2]}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $[PL]$ and $[PL_2]$ in terms of $[P]$ and $[L]$ into the equation for $\\nu([L])$:\n$$\\nu([L]) = \\frac{K_1 [P] [L] + 2 K_1 K_2 [P] [L]^2}{[P] + K_1 [P] [L] + K_1 K_2 [P] [L]^2}$$\nThe term for the free protein concentration, $[P]$, is a common factor in every term of the numerator and the denominator. It can be cancelled out:\n$$\\nu([L]) = \\frac{[P] (K_1 [L] + 2 K_1 K_2 [L]^2)}{[P] (1 + K_1 [L] + K_1 K_2 [L]^2)} = \\frac{K_1 [L] + 2 K_1 K_2 [L]^2}{1 + K_1 [L] + K_1 K_2 [L]^2}$$\nThis is the Adair-Klotz equation for this system.\n\nFinally, the fractional saturation $Y([L])$ is obtained by dividing $\\nu([L])$ by the number of sites, $n=2$:\n$$Y([L]) = \\frac{\\nu([L])}{n} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{K_1 [L] + 2 K_1 K_2 [L]^2}{1 + K_1 [L] + K_1 K_2 [L]^2} \\right)$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$Y([L]) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}K_1 [L] + K_1 K_2 [L]^2}{1 + K_1 [L] + K_1 K_2 [L]^2}$$\nThis is the required expression for the fractional saturation.\n\nNext, we address the matter of cooperativity. A common error is to assume that $K_1 = K_2$ signifies an absence of cooperativity. This is incorrect because the macroscopic constants $K_1$ and $K_2$ contain statistical factors related to the number of available binding and dissociation pathways. To properly analyze cooperativity, one must compare the observed macroscopic constants to the baseline expectation for two identical and non-interacting sites.\n\nLet us define a single intrinsic (or microscopic) association constant, $k$, for any given site, assuming the sites are identical and do not influence each other.\nFor the first binding event, $P \\to PL$:\nA ligand can bind to either of the $2$ available sites. So, the forward association rate is proportional to $2k$. A ligand can dissociate from the $1$ occupied site in the $PL$ complex. The total macroscopic association constant $K_1$ is the ratio of these statistical factors multiplied by the intrinsic constant:\n$$K_1 = \\frac{2}{1} k = 2k$$\nFor the second binding event, $PL \\to PL_2$:\nA ligand can bind to the $1$ remaining empty site. The forward association rate is proportional to $1k$. A ligand can dissociate from either of the $2$ occupied sites in the $PL_2$ complex. The total macroscopic association constant $K_2$ is therefore:\n$$K_2 = \\frac{1}{2} k$$\n\nThis analysis establishes the null hypothesis for non-cooperative binding. In this case, the relationship between the macroscopic constants must be:\n$$K_1 = 2k \\quad \\text{and} \\quad K_2 = \\frac{1}{2}k$$\nFrom this, we find the expected ratio:\n$$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{2k}{k/2} = 4 \\implies K_1 = 4K_2$$\nThis relationship, $K_1 = 4K_2$ (or $K_2 = K_1/4$), is the signature of two identical, non-interacting binding sites. The first macroscopic association constant is expected to be four times larger than the second purely due to statistical (entropic) factors, not due to any change in site affinity.\n\nCooperativity is defined as any deviation from this statistical baseline, which implies an energetic interaction between the sites.\n1.  **Positive Cooperativity**: The binding of the first ligand increases the affinity of the second site for the ligand. This means the intrinsic affinity for the second binding step is higher than for the first. In terms of macroscopic constants, the second binding event is stronger than statistically predicted. This means $K_2 > K_1 / 4$, which is equivalent to $4K_2 > K_1$. This corresponds to a sigmoidal binding curve.\n2.  **Negative Cooperativity**: The binding of the first ligand decreases the affinity of the second site. This means the second binding event is weaker than statistically predicted. This means $K_2 < K_1 / 4$, which is equivalent to $4K_2 < K_1$.\n3.  **No Cooperativity (Non-interacting sites)**: The affinity of the sites is independent of occupancy. This corresponds exactly to the statistical case, $4K_2 = K_1$.\n\nThus, the relative magnitudes of $4K_2$ and $K_1$ encode the nature of cooperativity, correctly distinguishing the statistical effect of site degeneracy from genuine allosteric interaction between the sites. Simple comparison of $K_1$ and $K_2$ is a naive and incorrect approach.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} K_1 [L] + K_1 K_2 [L]^2}{1 + K_1 [L] + K_1 K_2 [L]^2}}$$", "id": "2553008"}, {"introduction": "While mechanistic models provide deep insight, cooperative phenomena are often described empirically using the Hill equation, a powerful but non-mechanistic tool.

The core of the problem is a standard exercise in sensitivity analysis applied to the Hill formalism, which is scientifically grounded.

However, the request to determine \"dominant local influence\" by directly comparing the magnitudes of the partial derivatives $\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial n}$ and $\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial K_{0.5}}$ is ill-posed. These two quantities possess different physical dimensions—dimensionless and inverse concentration, respectively—and thus their magnitudes cannot be directly compared in a physically meaningful way. To proceed with a rigorous analysis, we must compare dimensionless quantities. We will therefore analyze the normalized sensitivities, $p \\left|\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial p}\\right|$, which quantify the absolute change in $Y$ for a fractional change in a parameter $p$ and are dimensionless for both parameters $n$ and $K_{0.5}$.\n\nWe begin by deriving the required partial derivatives of the fractional saturation function,\n$$\nY = \\frac{[L]^{n}}{K_{0.5}^{n} + [L]^{n}}\n$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the partial derivative of $Y$ with respect to the Hill coefficient $n$, treating $[L]$ and $K_{0.5}$ as constants.

The given values are:\n- Substrate concentration: $[S] = [S]_{\\mathrm{ext}} = 10^{-2}\\,\\hat{K}$, which implies the ratio $\\frac{[S]}{\\hat{K}} = 0.01$.\n- Hill coefficient estimate: $\\hat{n} = 3.0$.\n- Parameter uncertainties: $|\\delta n| = 0.05$ and $|\\delta \\ln K| = 0.05$.\n\nWe substitute these values into the error expression, using $\\hat{n}$ for $n$ and $\\hat{K}$ for $K$:\n$$ \\frac{|\\delta v|}{v} \\approx \\frac{|\\ln(0.01)|}{1 + (0.01)^{3.0}} (0.05) + \\frac{3.0}{1 + (0.01)^{3.0}} (0.05) $$\nLet's compute the terms.\nThe natural logarithm is $\\ln(0.01) = \\ln(10^{-2}) = -2 \\ln(10) \\approx -4.60517$. So $|\\ln(0.01)| \\approx 4.60517$.\nThe power term in the denominator is $(0.01)^{3.0} = (10^{-2})^3 = 10^{-6} = 0.000001$.\nThe denominator is $1 + 10^{-6} = 1.000001$.\n\nThe contribution from the uncertainty in $n$ is:\n$$ \\text{Term 1} = \\frac{4.60517...}{1.000001} \\times 0.05 \\approx 4.605165... \\times 0.05 \\approx 0.230258 $$\nThe contribution from the uncertainty in $\\ln K$ is:\n$$ \\text{Term 2} = \\frac{3.0}{1.000001} \\times 0.05 \\approx 2.999997... \\times 0.05 \\approx 0.150000 $$\n\nThe total worst-case fractional error is the sum of these two contributions:\n$$ \\frac{|\\delta v|}{v} \\approx 0.230258 + 0.150000 = 0.380258 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.3803$. This represents a worst-case error of approximately $38\\%$ in the predicted rate, highlighting the danger of extrapolating a fitted model far outside its empirical range.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3803}$$", "id": "2553005"}]}
