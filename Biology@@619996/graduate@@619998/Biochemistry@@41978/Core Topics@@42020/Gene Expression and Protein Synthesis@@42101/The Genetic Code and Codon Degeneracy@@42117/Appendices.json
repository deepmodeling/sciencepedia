It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular biology, specifically the structure of the genetic code, and poses a well-defined question in probability theory. All necessary data are provided, and the premises are internally consistent and factually correct for a standard theoretical model. We will therefore proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected number of amino-acid-specifying (sense) codons translated before a termination (stop) codon is encountered. This process can be modeled as a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials.\nLet a single trial consist of the ribosome reading one codon from the artificial mRNA. The codon is sampled independently and uniformly at random from the set of all possible codons.\n\nThe total number of possible codons, constructed from an alphabet of $4$ nucleotides ($\\{ \\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{G}, \\mathrm{U} \\}$) in triplets of length $3$, is $N_{total} = 4^3 = 64$.\n\nThe problem states there are $N_{stop} = 3$ termination codons.\nTherefore, the number of sense codons is $N_{sense} = N_{total} - N_{stop} = 64 - 3 = 61$.\n\nLet us define a \"success\" event as the trial in which a stop codon is read. Given the uniform sampling assumption, the probability of success in any single trial is:\n$$p = P(\\text{stop}) = \\frac{N_{stop}}{N_{total}} = \\frac{3}{64}$$\nLet us define a \"failure\" event as the trial in which a sense codon is read. The probability of failure in any single trial is:\n$$q = P(\\text{sense}) = \\frac{N_{sense}}{N_{total}} = \\frac{61}{64}$$\nIt is evident that $p + q = \\frac{3}{64} + \\frac{61}{64} = \\frac{64}{64} = 1$, as required.\n\nThe random variable $X$ is defined as the number of sense codons translated *before* the first stop codon is encountered. This corresponds to the number of failures before the first success. The possible values for $X$ are $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.\n\nThe event $X=k$ occurs if and only if the first $k$ codons are sense codons and the $(k+1)$-th codon is a stop codon. Since the trials are independent, the probability of this specific sequence of events is the product of their individual probabilities.\nThe probability mass function of $X$ is therefore:\n$$P(X=k) = (P(\\text{sense}))^k \\times P(\\text{stop}) = q^k p$$\nThis distribution, which describes the number of failures before the first success, is a geometric distribution.\n\nTo find the expectation of $X$, denoted $\\mathbb{E}[X]$, we use its fundamental definition:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} k \\cdot P(X=k)$$\nSubstituting the probability mass function we derived:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} k \\cdot q^k p$$\nWe can factor out the constant probability $p$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X] = p \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} k q^k$$\nTo evaluate the infinite sum $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} k q^k$, we begin with the well-known formula for a geometric series, which converges for $|q| < 1$.

Start from the Central Dogma and Watson–Crick pairing, and use the following well-tested pairing facts for the third codon position (the wobble position) at anticodon nucleotide position $34$:\n- An anticodon base $U$ at position $34$ can pair with codon bases $A$ or $G$.\n- An anticodon base $G$ at position $34$ can pair with codon bases $C$ or $U$.\n- An anticodon base $I$ (inosine, a common modification) at position $34$ can pair with codon bases $U$, $C$, or $A$.\n- An anticodon base $C$ at position $34$ pairs only with codon base $G$.\n- An anticodon base $A$ at position $34$ pairs only with codon base $U$.\n\nAssume standard Watson–Crick pairing at anticodon positions $35$ and $36$ with codon positions $2$ and $1$, respectively, and assume the universal nuclear genetic code with $61$ sense codons and $3$ stop codons.

Do not round.", "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information to derive a unique solution. It is a valid problem of biochemical logic. The task is to determine the minimum number of distinct transfer RNA (tRNA) anticodons required to unambiguously translate all $61$ sense codons of the standard genetic code.\n\nThe fundamental principle is that an anticodon on a tRNA molecule binds to a codon on a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule in an antiparallel fashion. A codon written $5'$-N$_1$N$_2$N$_3$-$3'$ is recognized by an anticodon written $3'$-N'_1N'_2N'_3$-$5'$. The anticodon nucleotide N'_3 at position $34$ pairs with the codon's third nucleotide, N$_3$. This is the \"wobble\" position. The nucleotides at anticodon positions $35$ (N'_2) and $36$ (N'_1) form standard Watson-Crick pairs with the codon nucleotides at positions $2$ (N$_2$) and $1$ (N$_1$), respectively. The standard pairs are $A-U$ and $G-C$.\n\nThe provided wobble pairing rules for the anticodon base at position $34$ versus the codon base at position $3$ are summarized as follows:\n- An anticodon base $U$ pairs with codon bases $A$ or $G$.\n- An anticodon base $G$ pairs with codon bases $C$ or $U$.\n- An anticodon base $I$ (inosine) pairs with codon bases $U$, $C$, or $A$.\n- An anticodon base $C$ pairs only with codon base $G$.\n- An anticodon base $A$ pairs only with codon base $U$.\n\nWe will analyze the codon groups based on their degeneracy to find the most efficient tRNA set for each, and then sum the results. The problem states that tRNAs for different amino acids, or for the same amino acid encoded by different codon families (e.g., Serine by $UCN$ and $AGY$), must be distinct. Our analysis respects this by treating each codon family (defined by the first two nucleotides) independently.\n\n1.  **Eight Fourfold-Degenerate Codon Boxes ($XYN$)**\n    These $8$ boxes are for the amino acids Proline ($CCN$), Alanine ($GCN$), Glycine ($GGN$), Threonine ($ACN$), Valine ($GUN$), Serine ($UCN$), Leucine ($CUN$), and Arginine ($CGN$). For each box, the first two codons are fixed ($XY$), and the third position ($N$) can be any of the four bases: $A$, $C$, $G$, or $U$.\n    To decode all four codons ($XYA$, $XYC$, $XYG$, $XYU$), we must find the minimum number of anticodons. No single anticodon base at the wobble position can recognize all four bases. Therefore, at least two tRNAs are required.\n    A minimal set of two tRNAs can be achieved in two ways:\n    a) One tRNA with wobble base $U$ (recognizes $A$ and $G$) and a second tRNA with wobble base $G$ (recognizes $C$ and $U$). This pair covers all four codons.\n    b) One tRNA with wobble base $I$ (recognizes $A$, $C$, and $U$) and a second tRNA with wobble base $C$ (recognizes $G$). This pair also covers all four codons.\n    In either case, the minimum number of tRNAs for a fourfold-degenerate codon box is $2$.\n    For the $8$ such boxes, the total number of tRNAs is $8 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\n2.  **Twelve Twofold-Degenerate Families**\n    These families are split into two types based on the third codon position being a purine ($R \\in \\{A, G\\}$) or a pyrimidine ($Y \\in \\{C, U\\}$).\n    a) **Families ending in a pyrimidine ($XYY$):** There are $7$ such families: Phenylalanine ($UUY$), Tyrosine ($UAY$), Histidine ($CAY$), Asparagine ($AAY$), Aspartic Acid ($GAY$), Cysteine ($UGY$), and Serine ($AGY$). Each family consists of two codons, one ending in $U$ and one in $C$. According to the wobble rules, an anticodon with base $G$ at position $34$ can pair with both $U$ and $C$. Therefore, a single tRNA is sufficient for each of these $7$ families. This requires $7 \\times 1 = 7$ tRNAs.\n    b) **Families ending in a purine ($XYR$):** There are $5$ such families: Glutamine ($CAR$), Lysine ($AAR$), Glutamic Acid ($GAR$), Leucine ($UUR$), and Arginine ($AGR$). Each family consists of two codons, one ending in $A$ and one in $G$. An anticodon with base $U$ at position $34$ can pair with both $A$ and $G$. Therefore, a single tRNA is sufficient for each of these $5$ families. This requires $5 \\times 1 = 5$ tRNAs.\n    The total for all $12$ twofold-degenerate families is $7 + 5 = 12$ tRNAs.\n\n3.  **One Threefold-Degenerate Family (Isoleucine)**\n    Isoleucine (Ile) is coded by $AUA$, $AUC$, and $AUU$. The codon $AUG$ codes for Methionine (Met), not Ile. We need to find the minimum number of tRNAs to read $AUA$, $AUC$, and $AUU$ without misreading $AUG$.\n    The wobble rules show that an anticodon with base $I$ (inosine) at position $34$ can recognize codon bases $A$, $C$, and $U$. A single tRNA with an anticodon such as $3'$-UAI-$5'$ can therefore decode all three Ile codons. Crucially, inosine does not pair with guanine ($G$), so this tRNA will not read the $AUG$ codon for Met, thus ensuring unambiguous translation. Using inosine is not only the most efficient option, it is necessary to avoid ambiguity with Met, as a standard wobble base $U$ in the anticodon would read both $AUA$ and $AUG$.\n    Thus, $1$ tRNA is required for Isoleucine.\n\n4.  **Two Onefold-Degenerate Codons (Methionine and Tryptophan)**\n    a) **Methionine (Met):** Coded by a single codon, $AUG$. To ensure it is read uniquely, we need an anticodon that pairs only with $G$ at the third position. The rules state that an anticodon with base $C$ at position $34$ pairs exclusively with $G$. Therefore, a tRNA with the anticodon $3'$-UAC-$5'$ will read only $AUG$. This requires $1$ tRNA.\n    b) **Tryptophan (Trp):** Coded by a single codon, $UGG$. Similar to Met, this requires an anticodon that pairs specifically with $G$. An anticodon with base $C$ at position $34$ is again the correct choice. A tRNA with the anticodon $3'$-ACC-$5'$ will read only $UGG$. This requires $1$ tRNA.\n    The total for these two codons is $1 + 1 = 2$ tRNAs.\n\n**Total Calculation**\nTo find the total minimum number of distinct tRNAs, we sum the requirements for each group:\n- From $8$ fourfold-degenerate boxes: $16$ tRNAs\n- From $12$ twofold-degenerate families: $12$ tRNAs\n- From $1$ threefold-degenerate family: $1$ tRNA\n- From $2$ onefold-degenerate codons: $2$ tRNAs\n\nTotal minimal number of tRNAs = $16 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 31$.\nThis set of $31$ tRNAs is the theoretical minimum required to unambiguously decode the $61$ sense codons according to the provided biophysical constraints.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{31}$$", "id": "2610806"}, {"introduction": "Finally, we address a deeper question: is the structure of the standard genetic code an evolutionary accident, or is it highly optimized?

The multiset of degeneracy degrees $\\{k\\}$ across amino acids is held identical to the standard code, and stop codons remain $3$ distinct codons outside all amino acid sets.\n\nYou may use the following standard-code degeneracy structure as foundational data: there are $5$ fourfold families (each with $4$ codons), $9$ twofold families (each with $2$ codons), $1$ threefold family (isoleucine), $2$ onefold families (methionine and tryptophan), and $3$ sixfold families (leucine, arginine, serine). In the standard code, within the sixfold families, leucine and arginine each consist of a fourfold subfamily and a twofold subfamily connected by exactly two first-position one-step synonymous links, whereas serine consists of a fourfold and a twofold subfamily with no one-step synonymous links between them.\n\nLet $P_{\\mathrm{std}}$ be the synonymous fraction under the standard code and $P_{\\mathrm{uni}}$ be the synonymous fraction under the uniform-degeneracy code defined above.
