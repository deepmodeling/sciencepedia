By calculating the total number of $ATP$ molecules required to replicate an entire prokaryotic genome, you will connect the microscopic action of the motor to its macroscopic energy burden on the cell [@problem_id:2600209].", "problem": "A prokaryotic cell with a single circular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) chromosome initiates bidirectional replication from one origin, establishing two replication forks. The chromosome length is $4 \\times 10^{6}$ base pairs, and the replication completes in $40$ min.

The parameters given ($L_{\\mathrm{bp}} \\approx 4 \\times 10^{6}$ bp, $T = 40$ min) are realistic for a bacterium such as *Escherichia coli*. The model of a helicase as a molecular motor with a defined ATP-to-step stoichiometry is a fundamental concept in biophysics. The problem is well-posed, objective, self-contained, and free of contradictions or vagueness. It asks for a derivation and calculation based on clear premises. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be constructed.\n\nThe fundamental task of DNA replication is to separate the two strands of the parent DNA duplex. In this model, this task is performed by helicase enzymes. The total amount of work to be done, in terms of molecular mechanics, is the unwinding of the entire chromosome, which has a length of $L_{\\mathrm{bp}}$ base pairs.\n\nThe problem states that the replicative helicase unwinds one base pair for each nucleotide step it takes along its tracking strand. This establishes a direct equivalence: to unwind the entire chromosome of $L_{\\mathrm{bp}}$ base pairs, the helicase(s) must collectively translocate a total distance of $L_{\\mathrm{bp}}$ nucleotides along the single-stranded DNA lattice.\n\nThe energy for this translocation is provided by ATP hydrolysis. The problem introduces a general helicase step efficiency, $\\eta$, defined as the number of nucleotides advanced per molecule of ATP hydrolyzed. The total number of ATP molecules required, $N_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$, is therefore the total number of nucleotides that must be traversed divided by the efficiency $\\eta$.\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = \\frac{\\text{Total nucleotide steps}}{\\eta}\n$$\nGiven that the total number of nucleotide steps required is equal to the total number of base pairs to be unwound, $L_{\\mathrm{bp}}$, the expression becomes:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{bp}}}{\\eta}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the expression to be a function of $L_{\\mathrm{bp}}$, $f$, and $\\eta$. Let us consider the role of the number of forks, $f$. The problem specifies bidirectional replication, which establishes $f=2$ forks. These two forks move in opposite directions around the circular chromosome, each replicating approximately half of the genome. The helicase at the first fork unwinds $L_{\\mathrm{bp}}/2$ base pairs, and the helicase at the second fork unwinds the other $L_{\\mathrm{bp}}/2$ base pairs.\n\nThe ATP consumed by the first helicase is $(L_{\\mathrm{bp}}/2)/\\eta$.\nThe ATP consumed by the second helicase is $(L_{\\mathrm{bp}}/2)/\\eta$.\nThe total ATP consumed is the sum of the ATP consumed at both forks:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{ATP}, \\text{total}} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{bp}}/2}{\\eta} + \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{bp}}/2}{\\eta} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{bp}}}{\\eta}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the total number of ATP molecules hydrolyzed is independent of the number of forks. The parameter $f$ determines how the total workload of unwinding is distributed, which affects the rate of replication, but not the total energy expenditure for one complete cycle. The formal expression as a function of the specified variables is therefore:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{ATP}}(L_{\\mathrm{bp}}, f, \\eta) = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{bp}}}{\\eta}\n$$\nThis expression correctly shows no dependence on $f$.\n\nNow, we evaluate this total for the given parameters: $L_{\\mathrm{bp}} = 4 \\times 10^{6}$ base pairs, $f = 2$, and $\\eta = 1$ nucleotide per ATP. The value $f=2$ is consistent with the setup but does not enter the final calculation of the total count. The value $\\eta=1$ corresponds to the baseline case described in the problem where one ATP is hydrolyzed for each nucleotide advanced.\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = \\frac{4 \\times 10^{6}}{1} = 4 \\times 10^{6}\n$$\nThus, $4 \\times 10^{6}$ molecules of ATP are hydrolyzed by the helicases to complete one full replication of the genome.\n\nFor the qualitative discussion:\n1.  On the effect of helicase efficiency $\\eta$: The derived expression $N_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = L_{\\mathrm{bp}}/\\eta$ shows that the total ATP burden is inversely proportional to the efficiency $\\eta$. If the helicase becomes more efficient (i.e., $\\eta > 1$), meaning it can translocate more than one nucleotide per ATP hydrolyzed, the total number of ATP molecules required for replication would decrease. Conversely, if the helicase is less efficient ($\\eta  1$), for instance due to futile hydrolysis cycles where ATP is consumed without productive movement, the total ATP cost would increase.\n\n2.  On the effect of replication time $T$: The total ATP count, $N_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$, is determined by the total length of the chromosome and the motor's stoichiometry ($\\eta$), not by the time taken to complete the process. Therefore, the parameter $T = 40$ min does not affect the total number of ATP molecules hydrolyzed. However, $T$ is fundamentally related to the *rate* of ATP hydrolysis, $R_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$. The average rate is the total ATP consumed divided by the total time:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{ATP}}}{T} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{bp}}}{\\eta T}\n$$\nA shorter replication time $T$ for the same genome length $L_{\\mathrm{bp}}$ would necessitate a higher instantaneous rate of helicase activity and consequently a higher rate of ATP hydrolysis. For the given values, $T = 40 \\text{ min} = 2400 \\text{ s}$, the total rate of ATP consumption is $R_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = (4 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ ATP}) / (2400 \\text{ s}) \\approx 1667 \\text{ ATP s}^{-1}$. This rate is distributed across the two replication forks.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4 \\times 10^{6}}\n$$", "id": "2600209"}, {"introduction": "Once the helicase creates single-stranded $DNA$ ($ssDNA$), this template is not a passive, linear track; it is prone to folding into secondary structures that can stall the $DNA$ polymerase.

An unwinding phase, where the helicase translocates at velocity $v_h$.\n2.  A priming phase, where the helicase is paused and the primase synthesizes a primer.\n\nLet us denote the duration of the unwinding phase as $T_{unwind}$ and the duration of the priming phase as $T_{prime}$.

This must be interpreted as the rate of transition from the unwinding state to the priming state. That is, $k_i$ is the inverse of the mean time spent in the unwinding phase before an initiation event occurs.
