This exercise delves into the concept of enzymatic processivity—an enzyme's ability to perform multiple catalytic cycles while continuously bound to its substrate. By building a kinetic model from first principles, you will derive the expected number of telomeric repeats added by a single telomerase molecule in one binding event, a crucial parameter determining its ability to counteract telomere shortening. This practice beautifully illustrates how a simple competition between enzyme translocation ($p_t$) and dissociation ($1-p_t$) gives rise to a predictable and powerful biological outcome [@problem_id:2600889].", "problem": "Telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) reverse transcriptase, mitigates the end-replication problem by processively adding short telomeric repeats to the single-stranded $3^{\\prime}$ overhang at chromosome termini. Consider a minimal kinetic model of a single telomerase enzyme acting on a single telomeric end in dilute solution, where the following assumptions hold, each grounded in standard biochemical kinetics for memoryless (Markovian) steps:\n\n1. Association of telomerase to a free telomeric end is a second-order, memoryless event with association rate constant $k_{\\text{on}}$ and telomeric end concentration $[T]$, so association events initiate with intensity $k_{\\text{on}}[T]$.\n2. Once bound, dissociation of telomerase from the telomeric end is a first-order, memoryless event with rate constant $k_{\\text{off}}$, independent of previous history.\n3. Synthesis of an individual telomeric repeat after initial alignment is fast relative to dissociation, so that within a single binding event the enzyme completes the current repeat before any dissociation decision is realized.\n4. After completing each repeat, the enzyme must undergo a conformational translocation to realign the template for the next repeat. At each such post-synthesis decision point, there is a memoryless competition between productive translocation and dissociation. The net probability that translocation occurs before dissociation at such a decision point is a parameter $p_t \\in (0,1)$, which may implicitly depend on microscopic rates but is here taken as given. Outcomes at successive decision points are independent and identically distributed due to the memoryless nature of the competing steps.\n\nUsing only these assumptions and standard definitions of Poisson and geometric processes from chemical kinetics, derive, from first principles, a self-consistent stochastic model for the number of repeats synthesized within a single binding event (from the instant of association to the instant of dissociation).

The assumptions provided are standard simplifications for constructing a tractable Markovian model of a processive enzyme. The problem is well-posed and objective. We shall proceed with the derivation from first principles.\n\nThe central task is to determine the statistics of the number of telomeric repeats, let us denote this random variable by $N$, added by a single telomerase enzyme during one continuous binding event. The analysis begins at the moment of enzyme-substrate association and ends upon dissociation.\n\nFirst, we analyze the roles of the given rate constants. The association rate constant, $k_{\\text{on}}$, and the telomeric end concentration, $[T]$, define the macroscopic rate at which new binding events are initiated. The intensity of this Poisson process is $\\lambda = k_{\\text{on}}[T]$. However, the problem asks for the number of repeats synthesized *per binding event*, a measure of the enzyme's processivity. This is a conditional property, an attribute of a single trajectory *after* association has occurred. Therefore, $k_{\\text{on}}$ and $[T]$ govern the time *between* binding events, not the duration or productivity *of* an event. They will not appear in the final expression for the expected number of repeats per event.\n\nThe dissociation rate constant, $k_{\\text{off}}$, is a first-order rate constant for the dissociation of the bound enzyme. According to assumption 4, after the synthesis of each repeat, the enzyme enters a state where it can either translocate to synthesize the next repeat or dissociate. This is a kinetic competition. If we were to denote the microscopic first-order rate constant for translocation as $k_t$, then the probability of translocation, $p_t$, would be the ratio of the translocation rate to the sum of all competing exit rates from that state. In this simplified model, the competition is only with dissociation. Thus, the probability of productive translocation would be $p_t = \\frac{k_t}{k_t + k_{\\text{off}}}$, and the probability of dissociation would be $p_d = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_t + k_{\\text{off}}} = 1 - p_t$. The problem provides $p_t$ as a given parameter, effectively \"black-boxing\" the microscopic rates $k_t$ and $k_{\\text{off}}$. Our final result must be expressed solely in terms of $p_t$, as instructed.\n\nNow, we derive the probability distribution for $N$.\nAccording to assumption 3, synthesis of the first repeat is fast and occurs before any possibility of dissociation at a post-synthesis decision point. This means that a binding event *always* results in the synthesis of at least one repeat. Therefore, the minimum value for $N$ is $1$, so $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$.\n\nLet us determine the probability of synthesizing exactly $k$ repeats, $P(N=k)$.\nFor the enzyme to synthesize exactly one repeat ($N=1$), it must synthesize the first repeat and then, at the first post-synthesis decision point, it must dissociate. The probability of this dissociation event is, by definition, $1-p_t$.\n$$P(N=1) = 1 - p_t$$\n\nFor the enzyme to synthesize exactly two repeats ($N=2$), it must complete the first repeat, successfully translocate (with probability $p_t$), complete the second repeat, and then dissociate at the second decision point (with probability $1-p_t$). Due to the memoryless (Markovian) nature of the steps, these are independent events.\n$$P(N=2) = p_t \\cdot (1 - p_t)$$\n\nGeneralizing for any integer $k \\ge 1$, for the enzyme to synthesize exactly $k$ repeats, it must successfully translocate after the first repeat, after the second, ..., and after the $(k-1)$-th repeat. This constitutes a sequence of $k-1$ successful translocations, each with probability $p_t$. After synthesizing the $k$-th repeat, it must then fail to translocate, meaning it dissociates, an event with probability $1-p_t$. The total probability for this sequence of independent events is:\n$$P(N=k) = (p_t)^{k-1} (1-p_t) \\quad \\text{for } k=1, 2, 3, \\dots$$\n\nThis is the probability mass function for a geometric distribution with success probability $p \\equiv (1-p_t)$ if one defines the random variable as the number of trials until the first success. Here, our \"trial\" is the decision point after each synthesis, and the process \"terminates\" upon a \"failure\" to translocate (i.e., dissociation). The random variable $N$ counts the number of repeats, which is equivalent to the number of trials until termination. This derived distribution, $P(N=k)$, is the self-consistent stochastic model requested.\n\nThe final step is to compute the expected number of repeats added per binding event, $\\mathbb{E}[N]$. By definition of expectation for a discrete random variable:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[N] = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k \\cdot P(N=k) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k (p_t)^{k-1} (1-p_t)$$\nWe can factor out the constant term $(1-p_t)$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[N] = (1-p_t) \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k (p_t)^{k-1}$$\nThe summation term is a standard form of an arithmetic-geometric series. We recognize that for any variable $x$ such that $|x| < 1$, the geometric series is given by:\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} x^k = \\frac{1}{1-x}$$\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to $x$ gives:\n$$\\frac{d}{dx} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} x^k = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k x^{k-1} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{1}{1-x} \\right) = \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}$$\nIn our problem, $x=p_t$. Since it is given that $p_t \\in (0,1)$, the condition $|p_t|<1$ is satisfied. We can substitute the result of the differentiation into our expression for $\\mathbb{E}[N]$:\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k (p_t)^{k-1} = \\frac{1}{(1-p_t)^2}$$\nTherefore, the expected value is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[N] = (1-p_t) \\left( \\frac{1}{(1-p_t)^2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{1-p_t}$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the expected number of repeats added per binding event, expressed solely in terms of $p_t$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{1-p_t}}$$", "id": "2600889"}]}
