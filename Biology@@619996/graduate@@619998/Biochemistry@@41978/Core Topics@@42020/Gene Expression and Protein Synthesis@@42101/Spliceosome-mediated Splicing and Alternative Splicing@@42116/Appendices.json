The principles of Position Weight Matrices (PWMs), log-odds scores, and Bayesian decision theory are standard in the field of bioinformatics. All numerical probabilities provided for the PWM at each position sum to $1$, and all premises are consistent. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe solution is divided into two parts as per the problem's request: first, the computation of the log-odds score $S$ for the given sequence, and second, the derivation of the decision threshold and the subsequent classification of the sequence.\n\nPart 1: Computation of the Log-Odds Score $S$\n\nThe log-odds score $S$ for a sequence $X = x_1x_2...x_L$ of length $L$ is the base-$2$ logarithm of the likelihood ratio. The likelihood ratio compares the probability of observing the sequence under the ESE model, represented by the Position Weight Matrix (PWM), to the probability of observing it under a background model. The PWM model assumes that each position in the sequence contributes independently to the overall probability.\n\nLet $M_1$ be the ESE model (PWM) and $M_0$ be the background model.

Therefore, the site is predicted to function as an ESE. The binary decision variable $y$ is $1$.\n\nThe final answer is a two-entry row matrix containing the computed score $S$ (rounded to four significant figures) and the binary decision $y$.\n$S = 10.34$\n$y = 1$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 10.34 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2606797"}, {"introduction": "Computational predictions and biophysical models are invaluable, but they must ultimately be tested against experimental observation.

Therefore, the total number of each type of junction in the mRNA pool is:\n- Number of $E_{1} \\rightarrow A$ junctions is $N_{inc}$.\n- Number of $A \\rightarrow E_{2}$ junctions is $N_{inc}$.\n- Number of $E_{1} \\rightarrow E_{2}$ junctions is $N_{skip}$.\n\nThe corresponding junction read counts, which we denote as $C(E_{1} \\rightarrow A)$, $C(A \\rightarrow E_{2})$, and $C(E_{1} \\rightarrow E_{2})$, are thus proportional to these molecular counts:\n$$ C(E_{1} \\rightarrow A) = k \\cdot N_{inc} $$\n$$ C(A \\rightarrow E_{2}) = k \\cdot N_{inc} $$\n$$ C(E_{1} \\rightarrow E_{2}) = k \\cdot N_{skip} $$\nFrom these relations, we can establish proportionalities for $N_{inc}$ and $N_{skip}$:\n$$ N_{skip} \\propto C(E_{1} \\rightarrow E_{2}) $$\nFor $N_{inc}$, we have two separate measurements from the read counts $C(E_{1} \\rightarrow A)$ and $C(A \\rightarrow E_{2})$. Due to stochastic noise inherent in sequencing experiments, these two counts will rarely be identical. A robust estimator must combine this information. The most straightforward and standard approach is to use the average of the two inclusion junction counts as the best estimate for the evidence supporting the inclusion isoform. Thus, the effective measure for the inclusion isoform abundance is proportional to the average of its junction counts:\n$$ N_{inc} \\propto \\frac{C(E_{1} \\rightarrow A) + C(A \\rightarrow E_{2})}{2} $$\nSubstituting these proportionalities into the definition of $\\Psi$ gives our estimator. Let $I_{eff} = \\frac{C(E_{1} \\rightarrow A) + C(A \\rightarrow E_{2})}{2}$ be the effective inclusion count and $S = C(E_{1} \\rightarrow E_{2})$ be the skipping count.\n$$ \\Psi \\approx \\frac{I_{eff}}{I_{eff} + S} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\left( C(E_{1} \\rightarrow A) + C(A \\rightarrow E_{2}) \\right)}{\\frac{1}{2} \\left( C(E_{1} \\rightarrow A) + C(A \\rightarrow E_{2}) \\right) + C(E_{1} \\rightarrow E_{2})} $$\nThis estimator correctly uses the information from all three junctions and accounts for the stoichiometry of junction formation: two junctions for one isoform type, one for the other.\n\nJustification for library size independence: The proportionality constant $k$ encapsulates the total library size $L$ (i.e., $k = \\alpha \\cdot L$ for some factor $\\alpha$ related to gene expression). When we substitute the read count expressions into the $\\Psi$ formula, the constant $k$ appears in both the numerator and the denominator, and thus cancels out:\n$$ \\Psi \\approx \\frac{k \\cdot N_{inc}}{k \\cdot N_{inc} + k \\cdot N_{skip}} = \\frac{k(N_{inc})}{k(N_{inc} + N_{skip})} = \\frac{N_{inc}}{N_{inc} + N_{skip}} $$\nBecause $\\Psi$ is a ratio of counts from the same library, any normalization factors, including library size, that apply uniformly to all counts will cancel. Thus, the total library sizes ($25 \\times 10^{6}$ for control, $30 \\times 10^{6}$ for knockdown) are not needed for the calculation of $\\Psi$ for each condition.\n\nNow, we compute the required values.\n\nFor the control condition:\n- Inclusion junction counts: $C(E_{1} \\rightarrow A)_{C} = 210$, $C(A \\rightarrow E_{2})_{C} = 190$.\n- Skipping junction count: $C(E_{1} \\rightarrow E_{2})_{C} = 600$.\nThe effective inclusion count is $I_{C} = \\frac{210 + 190}{2} = \\frac{400}{2} = 200$.\nThe skipping count is $S_{C} = 600$.\n$$ \\Psi_{\\text{control}} = \\frac{I_{C}}{I_{C} + S_{C}} = \\frac{200}{200 + 600} = \\frac{200}{800} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25 $$\n\nFor the RBP knockdown condition:\n- Inclusion junction counts: $C(E_{1} \\rightarrow A)_{KD} = 120$, $C(A \\rightarrow E_{2})_{KD} = 100$.\n- Skipping junction count: $C(E_{1} \\rightarrow E_{2})_{KD} = 900$.\nThe effective inclusion count is $I_{KD} = \\frac{120 + 100}{2} = \\frac{220}{2} = 110$.\nThe skipping count is $S_{KD} = 900$.\n$$ \\Psi_{\\text{knockdown}} = \\frac{I_{KD}}{I_{KD} + S_{KD}} = \\frac{110}{110 + 900} = \\frac{110}{1010} = \\frac{11}{101} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the change in PSI, $\\Delta \\Psi$:\n$$ \\Delta \\Psi = \\Psi_{\\text{knockdown}} - \\Psi_{\\text{control}} = \\frac{11}{101} - \\frac{1}{4} $$\nTo subtract these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $101 \\times 4 = 404$:\n$$ \\Delta \\Psi = \\frac{11 \\times 4}{404} - \\frac{1 \\times 101}{404} = \\frac{44 - 101}{404} = -\\frac{57}{404} $$\nTo provide the final answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$ \\Delta \\Psi = -\\frac{57}{404} \\approx -0.1410891\\ldots $$\nRounding to four significant figures yields $-0.1411$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-0.1411} $$", "id": "2606856"}]}
