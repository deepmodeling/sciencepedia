In a set of single-turnover kinetic measurements conducted under conditions where both amino acids are present at low concentrations relative to their respective $K_\\mathrm{M}$ values, the following specificity constants were obtained: for the cognate amino acid, $(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_\\mathrm{M})_{\\mathrm{cog}} = 2 \\times 10^{7}$ M$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, and for a near-cognate noncognate amino acid, $(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_\\mathrm{M})_{\\mathrm{non}} = 2 \\times 10^{2}$ M$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$. Assume that in the cytosol the concentrations of these two amino acids can be comparable, and that the initial selection step follows the regime where the initial velocity contributed by each substrate is proportional to its specificity constant times its concentration.
