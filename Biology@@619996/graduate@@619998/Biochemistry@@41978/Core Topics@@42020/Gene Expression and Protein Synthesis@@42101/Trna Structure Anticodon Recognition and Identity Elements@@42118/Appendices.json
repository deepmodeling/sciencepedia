Mechanistically, deleting $\\mathrm{A}_{76}$ removes the canonical $2'$/$3'$-hydroxyl-bearing adenosine scaffold and key acceptor-stem identity contacts, sharply lowering $p$ (in-line attack probability) and weakening binding. The CCA-adding enzyme template-independently restores $\\mathrm{CCA}$, reinstating $\\mathrm{A}_{76}$, which increases $p$ and improves binding, thereby rescuing both $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ and $K_M$ toward wild type.\n\nB. $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ remains approximately $10 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $K_M$ increases roughly $10$-fold, and $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_M$ decreases only $10$-fold because the $3'$-terminal ribose of $\\mathrm{C}_{75}$ can still attack; deletion mainly affects binding.

Substituting the expression for $[ET]$:\n$$\nv = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{chem}} k_{\\mathrm{on}}[E]_{\\text{total}}[T]}{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{chem}} + k_{\\mathrm{on}}[T]}\n$$\nThis equation can be expressed in the standard Michaelis-Menten form, $v = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}[E]_{\\text{total}}[T]}{K_M + [T]}$, by dividing the numerator and denominator by $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$:\n$$\nv = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{chem}}[E]_{\\text{total}}[T]}{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{chem}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}} + [T]}\n$$\nBy direct comparison, we identify the expressions for the catalytic constant ($k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$) and the Michaelis constant ($K_M$):\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{cat}} = k_{\\mathrm{chem}}\n$$\n$$\nK_M = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{chem}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}\n$$\nThe catalytic efficiency is given by the ratio $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_M$. We are also given that $k_{\\mathrm{chem}} = p \\, k_0$, where $p$ is the probability of correct geometry for nucleophilic attack and $k_0$ is the intrinsic chemical rate constant.\n\nNow, we calculate these parameters for both the wild-type (WT) and truncated ($\\Delta \\mathrm{A}_{76}$) tRNA.\n\n**Wild-Type (WT) tRNA Analysis**\nGiven parameters:\n$k_{\\mathrm{on}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{7} \\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{off}} = 10 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$k_0 = 20 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$p_{\\mathrm{WT}} = 0.50$\n\nFirst, we determine $k_{\\mathrm{chem}}$ for the WT reaction:\n$k_{\\mathrm{chem, WT}} = p_{\\mathrm{WT}} \\, k_0 = 0.50 \\times 20 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 10 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nNow we calculate the kinetic parameters:\n$k_{\\mathrm{cat, WT}} = k_{\\mathrm{chem, WT}} = 10 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\n$K_{M, \\mathrm{WT}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}} + k_{\\mathrm{chem, WT}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}} = \\frac{10 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 10 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1.0 \\times 10^{7} \\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{20 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1.0 \\times 10^{7} \\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{M} = 2.0 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\n$(k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_M)_{\\mathrm{WT}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat, WT}}}{K_{M, \\mathrm{WT}}} = \\frac{10 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{M}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{6} \\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nFor the WT enzyme, note that $k_{\\mathrm{off}} = 10 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{chem, WT}} = 10 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ are equal.

The ratio is $10 / 0.40 = 25$. This is a $25$-fold decrease.\n2.  **Change in $K_M$**: $K_M$ increases from $2.0 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ to approximately $20 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. This is a $10$-fold increase, indicating weaker apparent affinity.\n3.  **Change in $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_M$**: The catalytic efficiency decreases from $5.0 \\times 10^{6} \\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ to $2.0 \\times 10^{4} \\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The ratio is $(5.0 \\times 10^{6}) / (2.0 \\times 10^{4}) = 250$. This is a $250$-fold decrease.\n\n**Mechanistic Conclusions**:\n- The turnover number, $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$, is determined by the rate of the chemical step, $k_{\\mathrm{chem}}$, in both cases. The dramatic drop in $p$ from $0.50$ to $0.020$ upon deleting $\\mathrm{A}_{76}$ directly causes the $25$-fold drop in $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$. This shows that $\\mathrm{A}_{76}$ is not merely the reactive nucleotide but is crucial for positioning the terminal ribose for efficient in-line nucleophilic attack.\n- The increase in $K_M$ is due to a combination of weaker binding (the dissociation constant $K_d = k_{\\mathrm{off}}/k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ increases from $1 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ to $20 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) and the change in the relative values of $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{chem}}$. The deletion of $\\mathrm{A}_{76}$ clearly disrupts important binding contacts.\n- The tRNA nucleotidyltransferase is responsible for post-transcriptional synthesis of the $3'$-CCA terminus. By specifically adding the terminal $\\mathrm{A}_{76}$ onto a tRNA ending in ...$\\mathrm{C}_{74}\\mathrm{C}_{75}$, this enzyme restores the correct substrate for the aaRS. This restoration would rescue the binding affinity (lowering $K_M$) and, critically, restore the high probability of correct substrate positioning (increasing $p$), thereby rescuing $k_{\\mathrmt{cat}}$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nA. **Correct**. This option correctly states that $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ decreases approximately $25$-fold (from $10 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ to $0.40 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$), $K_M$ increases approximately $10$-fold (from about $2 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ to about $20 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$), and $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_M$ decreases approximately $250$-fold. Its analysis of what determines $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ and $K_M$ is accurate: $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ is limited by the chemical step, while $K_M$ reflects mixed control in WT but is dominated by $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ in the mutant. The mechanistic explanation regarding the role of $\\mathrm{A}_{76}$ for binding and positioning ($p$) is consistent with our analysis. Finally, it correctly describes the rescue function of the CCA-adding enzyme.\n\nB. **Incorrect**. This option claims $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ remains unchanged and $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_M$ decreases by only $10$-fold. Both statements are quantitatively false based on our calculations. The assertion that deletion mainly affects binding is a misrepresentation; the effect on catalysis ($k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$) is profound. The description of the CCA-adding enzyme's function is also incorrect.\n\nC. **Incorrect**. This option claims both $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ and $K_M$ decrease, which contradicts our finding that $K_M$ increases. The statement that $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_M$ is approximately unchanged is grossly incorrect, as it drops $250$-fold.\n\nD. **Incorrect**. This option makes the unsubstantiated claim that deletion *increases* $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$, which is directly contradicted by the provided data for the probability $p$. It also incorrectly states that $K_M$ is unchanged.\n\nE. **Incorrect**. While the quantitative changes for $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ and $K_M$ are correctly stated, the rationale is fundamentally flawed. It incorrectly attributes the kinetic effects at the aaRS to \"ribosomal decoding defects,\" confusing two distinct stages of protein synthesis. The function of the CCA-adding enzyme is also misidentified as relate to ribosomal decoding rather than tRNA substrate maturation for aminoacylation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2614140"}]}
