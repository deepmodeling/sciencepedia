This practice explores the profound stoichiometric consequence of this mechanism, where the cell's capacity for repair is a finite, countable resource.

The repair of $O^6\\text{-methylguanine}$ is performed by $O^6$-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), a direct-reversal, single-turnover or “suicide” repair protein that transfers the methyl group to an active-site cysteine and is irreversibly inactivated after one repair event. Consider the following experimentally controlled regime: immediately after the TMZ pulse, each cell contains exactly $L = 1.0 \\times 10^{4}$ $O^6\\text{-methylguanine}$ lesions distributed uniformly throughout the nuclear genome. Two isogenic cell lines differ only in the number of nuclear MGMT molecules available at the start of the pulse: the high-MGMT line has $M_{\\mathrm{H}} = 8.0 \\times 10^{3}$ molecules per nucleus, and the low-MGMT line has $M_{\\mathrm{L}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{2}$ molecules per nucleus.

It is scientifically grounded in the established biochemistry of DNA repair by $O^{6}$-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), well-posed with sufficient data, and objectively formulated. The solution proceeds.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the fraction of persistent $O^6\\text{-methylguanine}$ lesions in two cell lines with different initial concentrations of the repair protein MGMT. The fundamental principle governing this system is the stoichiometry of the repair reaction.\n\nLet $L$ be the initial number of $O^6\\text{-methylguanine}$ lesions per cell nucleus. From the problem statement, we have:\n$$L = 1.0 \\times 10^{4}$$\nLet $M$ be the initial number of MGMT molecules per cell nucleus. The problem defines two cell lines: a high-MGMT line and a low-MGMT line.\nFor the high-MGMT line, the number of MGMT molecules is:\n$$M_{\\mathrm{H}} = 8.0 \\times 10^{3}$$\nFor the low-MGMT line, the number of MGMT molecules is:\n$$M_{\\mathrm{L}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{2}$$\n\nThe problem states that MGMT is a \"single-turnover\" or \"suicide\" enzyme. This means that one molecule of MGMT can repair exactly one $O^6\\text{-methylguanine}$ lesion before it is irreversibly inactivated. This establishes a strict one-to-one ($1:1$) stoichiometry for the reaction:\n$$1\\ \\mathrm{MGMT} + 1\\ O^{6}\\text{-methylguanine} \\rightarrow 1\\ \\text{inactivated MGMT} + 1\\ \\text{repaired guanine}$$\n\nThe total number of lesions that can be repaired, denoted $L_{\\mathrm{repaired}}$, is therefore limited by the number of available MGMT molecules. The reaction proceeds until one of the reactants, either the lesions or the MGMT molecules, is completely consumed. Thus, the number of repaired lesions is the minimum of the initial number of lesions and the initial number of MGMT molecules.\n$$L_{\\mathrm{repaired}} = \\min(L, M)$$\n\nWe are asked to compute the fraction of lesions that persist after the reaction has gone to completion. The number of persistent lesions, $L_{\\mathrm{persist}}$, is the initial number of lesions minus the number of repaired lesions:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{persist}} = L - L_{\\mathrm{repaired}} = L - \\min(L, M)$$\n\nThe fraction of persistent lesions, $f_{\\mathrm{persist}}$, is the number of persistent lesions divided by the initial number of lesions:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{persist}} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{persist}}}{L} = \\frac{L - \\min(L, M)}{L} = 1 - \\frac{\\min(L, M)}{L}$$\n\nNow, we apply this general formula to each cell line.\n\nCase 1: High-MGMT Line\nThe initial numbers are $L = 1.0 \\times 10^{4}$ and $M_{\\mathrm{H}} = 8.0 \\times 10^{3}$.\nWe compare $L$ and $M_{\\mathrm{H}}$:\n$$8.0 \\times 10^{3} < 1.0 \\times 10^{4}$$\nTherefore, $M_{\\mathrm{H}} < L$.

The MGMT enzyme is the limiting reactant. The number of repaired lesions is equal to the initial number of MGMT molecules.\n$$L_{\\mathrm{repaired, L}} = \\min(L, M_{\\mathrm{L}}) = M_{\\mathrm{L}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{2}$$\nThe number of persistent lesions is:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{persist, L}} = L - M_{\\mathrm{L}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{4}) - (5.0 \\times 10^{2}) = 10000 - 500 = 9500 = 9.5 \\times 10^{3}$$\nThe fraction of persistent lesions for the low-MGMT line, $f_{\\mathrm{persist, L}}$, is:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{persist, L}} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{persist, L}}}{L} = \\frac{9.5 \\times 10^{3}}{1.0 \\times 10^{4}} = 0.95$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $0.950$.\n\nThe final answers are the fractions of persistent lesions for the high-MGMT and low-MGMT lines, respectively, reported as decimal fractions rounded to three significant figures.\nThe values are $0.200$ for the high-MGMT line and $0.950$ for the low-MGMT line.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.200 & 0.950 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2556236"}, {"introduction": "Moving from chemical reversal to light-powered repair, we now consider DNA photolyase, an enzyme that uses energy from visible light to repair UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs).
