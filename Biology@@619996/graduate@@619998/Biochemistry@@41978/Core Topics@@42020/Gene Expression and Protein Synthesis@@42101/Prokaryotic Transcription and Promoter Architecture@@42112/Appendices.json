The model becomes:\n$$ A(L) = C + B (\\cos(\\omega L)\\cos(\\phi) - \\sin(\\omega L)\\sin(\\phi)) $$\nThis can be expressed as a linear combination of basis functions for a fixed $\\omega$:\n$$ A(L) = C + B_1 \\cos(\\omega L) + B_2 \\sin(\\omega L) $$\nwhere the linear parameters are $C$, $B_1 = B \\cos(\\phi)$, and $B_2 = -B \\sin(\\phi)$.\n\nFor any given value of the non-linear parameter $R$ (and thus $\\omega$), the problem reduces to a linear least squares fit. We can find the optimal parameters $C$, $B_1$, and $B_2$ that minimize the sum of squared residuals (SSR) for that specific $R$. The SSR is given by:\n$$ \\text{SSR}(R) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( A_i - \\left( \\hat{C} + \\hat{B}_1 \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{R}L_i\\right) + \\hat{B}_2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{R}L_i\\right) \\right) \\right)^2 $$\nwhere $(\\hat{C}, \\hat{B}_1, \\hat{B}_2)$ are the solutions to the linear least squares problem for the given $R$.\n\nThis transforms the multi-dimensional optimization into a more manageable one-dimensional search for the optimal helical repeat, $R^*$, that minimizes $\\text{SSR}(R)$. The search for $R^*$ will be conducted over a physically plausible range. The helical repeat of B-form DNA under physiological conditions is typically near $10.5$ bp/turn. Therefore, a search interval of $R \\in [8.0, 14.0]$ bp/turn is appropriate. We will employ a numerical optimization routine to find the $R$ value within this interval that minimizes the SSR.\n\nThe overall algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Define an objective function that takes a candidate value for $R$, the spacer lengths $L$, and the activities $A$.\n2.  Inside this function:\n    a.  Calculate $\\omega = 2\\pi/R$.\n    b.  Construct the design matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ for the linear model, where the columns are $1$, $\\cos(\\omega L_i)$, and $\\sin(\\omega L_i)$.\n    c.  Solve the linear system $\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\mathbf{A}$ for the parameter vector $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = [C, B_1, B_2]^T$ using a standard least squares solver.\n    d.  Return the sum of squared residuals from this fit.\n3.  Use a scalar minimization algorithm to find the optimal $R^*$ that minimizes this objective function, bounded by the interval $[8.0, 14.0]$.\n4.  With the optimal $R^*$, perform one final linear least squares fit to obtain the optimal coefficients $\\hat{C}$, $\\hat{B}_1$, and $\\hat{B}_2$.\n5.  Recover the phase offset $\\phi$ from the linear coefficients. From their definitions, we have $\\hat{B}_1 = B \\cos(\\phi)$ and $\\hat{B}_2 = -B \\sin(\\phi)$. The phase $\\phi$ can be robustly computed using the two-argument arctangent function:\n    $$ \\phi^* = \\mathrm{atan2}(-\\hat{B}_2, \\hat{B}_1) $$\n    This function correctly resolves the quadrant and returns a value in the required interval $(-\\pi, \\pi]$.\n6.  The final parameters $R^*$ and $\\phi^*$ are then rounded to three decimal places as required.
