The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and constraints for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. The scenario described—an underwound DNA molecule storing torsional energy before it buckles to form plectonemes—is a physically realistic and central concept in molecular biology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to compute the total torsional elastic free energy, $G_{twist}$, stored in the DNA segment. This energy is the integral of the elastic free energy density over the total contour length, $L$, of the molecule.\nThe foundational expression for the energy density is given as $\\frac{1}{2}C\\left(\\Omega_{3}(s)-\\Omega_{3}^{0}\\right)^{2}$, where $\\Omega_{3}(s)$ is the local twist rate at position $s$ along the DNA contour, and $\\Omega_{3}^{0}$ is the twist rate of the relaxed, unstressed molecule.\nThe total torsional energy $G_{twist}$ is therefore:\n$$G_{twist} = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{1}{2}C\\left(\\Omega_{3}(s)-\\Omega_{3}^{0}\\right)^{2} ds$$\nThe problem states that the DNA molecule is a homogeneous rod and that the twist deformation is uniformly distributed. This implies that both the relaxed twist rate $\\Omega_{3}^{0}$ and the deformed twist rate $\\Omega_{3}(s)$ are constant along the contour length. Let us denote them as $\\Omega_{3}^{0}$ and $\\Omega_{3}$, respectively. The integrand is now a constant, and the integral simplifies to:\n$$G_{twist} = \\frac{1}{2}C\\left(\\Omega_{3}-\\Omega_{3}^{0}\\right)^{2} \\int_{0}^{L} ds = \\frac{1}{2}C\\left(\\Omega_{3}-\\Omega_{3}^{0}\\right)^{2} L$$\nHere, $L$ is the total contour length of the DNA segment, which is the number of base pairs $N$ multiplied by the axial rise per base pair $h$:\n$$L = N \\cdot h = 2000 \\cdot 0.34\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 680\\,\\mathrm{nm}$$\nNext, we must relate the twist rates $\\Omega_{3}$ and $\\Omega_{3}^{0}$ to the topological properties of the DNA. The twist, $Tw$, is given by the foundational relation:\n$$Tw = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{L}\\Omega_{3}(s)\\,ds$$\nSince $\\Omega_{3}$ is constant, this simplifies to $Tw = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\Omega_{3}L$. This expression can be rearranged to express the twist rate in terms of the twist number:\n$$\\Omega_{3} = \\frac{2\\pi Tw}{L}$$\nSimilarly, for the relaxed state, the twist number is $Tw_{0}$ and the twist rate is $\\Omega_{3}^{0}$, related by $\\Omega_{3}^{0} = \\frac{2\\pi Tw_{0}}{L}$.\nSubstituting these expressions for the twist rates back into the equation for $G_{twist}$:\n$$G_{twist} = \\frac{1}{2}C \\left( \\frac{2\\pi Tw}{L} - \\frac{2\\pi Tw_{0}}{L} \\right)^{2} L = \\frac{1}{2}C \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{L} \\right)^{2} (Tw - Tw_{0})^{2} L$$\n$$G_{twist} = \\frac{1}{2}C \\frac{4\\pi^{2}}{L^{2}} (\\Delta Tw)^{2} L = \\frac{2\\pi^{2}C}{L} (\\Delta Tw)^{2}$$\nwhere $\\Delta Tw = Tw - Tw_{0}$ is the change in twist from the relaxed state.\n\nThe final step is to connect the change in twist $\\Delta Tw$ to the given change in linking number $\\Delta Lk$. We use the White–Fuller relation, $Lk = Tw + Wr$. The change in these quantities from the relaxed state (denoted by subscript $0$) to the current state is:\n$$\\Delta Lk = Lk - Lk_{0} = (Tw - Tw_{0}) + (Wr - Wr_{0}) = \\Delta Tw + \\Delta Wr$$\nThe problem specifies that before the formation of any plectonemes, the DNA is to be considered as a straight rod. In such a conformation, the writhe is zero, so $Wr = 0$. The relaxed state of the DNA is also a straight, untwisted rod, with $Wr_{0} = 0$. Therefore, the change in writhe $\\Delta Wr = 0$.\nUnder this condition, the relation simplifies to:\n$$\\Delta Lk = \\Delta Tw$$\nWe are given $\\Delta Lk = -10$. Thus, $\\Delta Tw = -10$.\nNow we can write the final expression for the torsional energy solely in terms of the given parameters:\n$$G_{twist} = \\frac{2\\pi^{2}C}{L} (\\Delta Lk)^{2}$$\nWe substitute the numerical values into this derived expression:\n- $C = 250\\,\\mathrm{pN\\cdot nm^{2}}$\n- $L = 680\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n- $\\Delta Lk = -10$\n$$G_{twist} = \\frac{2\\pi^{2}(250\\,\\mathrm{pN\\cdot nm^{2}})}{680\\,\\mathrm{nm}} (-10)^{2}$$\n$$G_{twist} = \\frac{2\\pi^{2} \\cdot 250 \\cdot 100}{680} \\,\\mathrm{pN\\cdot nm}$$\n$$G_{twist} = \\frac{493480.22...}{680} \\,\\mathrm{pN\\cdot nm} \\approx 725.7062... \\,\\mathrm{pN\\cdot nm}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$G_{twist} \\approx 726\\,\\mathrm{pN\\cdot nm}$$\nThis is the total elastic free energy stored in the underwound DNA segment due to torsional stress before any supercoiling occurs.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{726}$$", "id": "2557526"}, {"introduction": "The principles of DNA topology are not just descriptive; they are critical for understanding how biological processes and external agents manipulate DNA structure.

It describes a standard scenario in the biophysical chemistry of nucleic acids. All parameters provided are physically realistic and sufficient for a unique solution. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this system is the conservation of the topological linking number, $Lk$, for a covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) molecule in the absence of topoisomerase enzymes. The linking number is an integer constant representing the number of times one strand winds around the other. It is related to the twist ($Tw$, the number of helical turns) and writhe ($Wr$, a measure of the coiling of the helix axis in space) by the equation:\n$$Lk = Tw + Wr$$\n\nThe problem begins with a relaxed plasmid of length $L = 5400$ base pairs (bp). In its relaxed state, the DNA is assumed to lie flat, meaning its writhe is zero ($Wr_0 = 0$). The linking number of this initial relaxed state, denoted $Lk_0$, is therefore equal to its twist, $Tw_0$. The twist is the total number of base pairs divided by the helical repeat, $h = 10.5$ bp/turn.\n$$Lk = Lk_0 = Tw_0 = \\frac{L}{h}$$\nSince no strand breaks occur, this value of $Lk$ remains constant throughout the process.\n$$Lk_0 = \\frac{5400}{10.5} = \\frac{10800}{21} = \\frac{3600}{7} \\approx 514.286$$\nThis is the fixed linking number of the plasmid.\n\nNext, an intercalating ligand is introduced. The ligand binds and unwinds the DNA duplex. This alters the preferred, or intrinsic, helical structure of the DNA. To quantify the resulting supercoiling, we must determine the new reference state, which is the linking number the plasmid *would have* if it were allowed to relax in the presence of the ligand. This relaxed linking number under the new chemical conditions is denoted $Lk_0^{\\ast}$.\n\nThe total number of bound ligand molecules, $N$, is given by the product of the binding density, $r$, and the total number of base pairs, $L$:\n$$N = r \\times L = 0.08 \\, \\frac{\\text{ligands}}{\\text{bp}} \\times 5400 \\, \\text{bp} = 432 \\, \\text{ligands}$$\nEach ligand unwinds the helix by an angle of $\\Delta\\phi_{ligand} = 26^{\\circ}$.
