At time $t=0$, the culture is rapidly filtered, washed, and transferred into a medium containing only isotopically light nitrogen, $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$. The cells then undergo synchronous rounds of genome duplication with a generation time that exactly equals the time to complete one round of DNA replication. Assume that DNA replication is semiconservative, as implemented by the replicative DNA polymerase (family C in bacteria or family B in archaea/eukaryotes), meaning that each daughter duplex comprises one parental template strand and one newly synthesized strand. Assume no repair synthesis or recombination alters isotopic composition of pre-existing strands and that strand lengths and base compositions are uniform across molecules.\n\nAt the end of each of the first three generations ($n=1,2,3$), an aliquot of cells is taken, DNA is extracted and centrifuged to isopycnic equilibrium in a cesium chloride (CsCl) gradient.

Determine the relative abundance (fraction) of different isotopically labeled DNA duplexes after each generation of replication.\n2.  Calculate the buoyant densities of these DNA duplexes.\n3.  Establish the function relating density to radial position in the cesium chloride (CsCl) gradient.\n4.  Calculate the specific radial positions for each DNA species.\n5.  Combine these results to provide the final answer as specified.\n\n**Step 1: Relative Abundance of DNA Species**\n\nLet an original DNA strand, fully labeled with $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$, be denoted by $H$. A newly synthesized strand, labeled with $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$, is denoted by $L$. A double-stranded DNA molecule is represented by its constituent strands, e.g., $H-H$ for a fully heavy duplex.\n\nAt time $t=0$ (Generation $n=0$), all DNA molecules are of the $H-H$ type.\n\n**Generation 1 ($n=1$):**\nThe initial population of $H-H$ molecules replicates in a medium containing only $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$. According to the semiconservative model, each $H-H$ duplex unwinds, and each $H$ strand serves as a template for the synthesis of a new $L$ strand.\n$$H-H \\xrightarrow{\\text{replicate w/ } ^{14}\\mathrm{N}} H-L + H-L$$\nThus, after one generation, all DNA molecules are of the hybrid $H-L$ type.\nThe total population of DNA molecules has doubled. The fraction of hybrid molecules is $1$.\n-   Fraction of $L-L$ duplexes: $I_{14,14} = 0$.\n-   Fraction of $H-L$ duplexes: $I_{\\mathrm{hyb}} = 1$.\n\n**Generation 2 ($n=2$):**\nThe $H-L$ molecules from Generation $1$ replicate in the $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ medium. Each $H-L$ duplex unwinds. The $H$ template strand synthesizes a new $L$ partner, forming an $H-L$ duplex. The $L$ template strand synthesizes a new $L$ partner, forming an $L-L$ duplex.\n$$H-L \\xrightarrow{\\text{replicate w/ } ^{14}\\mathrm{N}} H-L + L-L$$\nSince the entire population at $n=1$ was $H-L$, half of the resulting molecules at $n=2$ will be $H-L$ and the other half will be $L-L$.\n-   Fraction of $L-L$ duplexes: $I_{14,14} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n-   Fraction of $H-L$ duplexes: $I_{\\mathrm{hyb}} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n**Generation 3 ($n=3$):**\nThe population from Generation $2$ (half $L-L$, half $H-L$) replicates.\n-   The $L-L$ molecules, making up $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the population, will only produce more $L-L$ molecules.

This corresponds to the $L-L$ species.\n-   Density of fully heavy ($^{15}\\mathrm{N}$) DNA: $\\rho_{15} = 1.724\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mL}^{-1}$. This corresponds to the $H-H$ species.\n\nThe density of the hybrid ($^{14}\\mathrm{N}$/$^{15}\\mathrm{N}$) DNA, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{hyb}}$, is the arithmetic mean of $\\rho_{14}$ and $\\rho_{15}$:\n$$\\rho_{\\mathrm{hyb}} = \\frac{\\rho_{14} + \\rho_{15}}{2} = \\frac{1.710 + 1.724}{2} = \\frac{3.434}{2} = 1.717\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mL}^{-1}$$\n\n**Step 3: Density Gradient Function**\n\nThe CsCl density, $\\rho(r)$, is a linear function of the radial position, $r$.

At $r_{\\max}=7.20\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, $\\rho_{\\max}=1.770\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mL}^{-1}$.\n\nThe slope, $a$, is the change in density over the change in radius:\n$$a = \\frac{\\rho_{\\max} - \\rho_{\\min}}{r_{\\max} - r_{\\min}} = \\frac{1.770 - 1.690}{7.20 - 5.20} = \\frac{0.080}{2.00} = 0.040\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mL}^{-1}\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$$\n\nThe intercept, $b$, can be found using one of the points:\n$$\\rho_{\\min} = a r_{\\min} + b \\implies b = \\rho_{\\min} - a r_{\\min}$$\n$$b = 1.690 - (0.040)(5.20) = 1.690 - 0.208 = 1.482\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mL}^{-1}$$\nThus, the density function is $\\rho(r) = 0.040 r + 1.482$.\n\n**Step 4: Radial Positions of DNA Bands**\n\nA DNA band forms at the radius $r$ where its buoyant density equals the gradient density, i.e., $\\rho_{\\mathrm{DNA}} = \\rho(r)$. We can find the radius by inverting the function:\n$$r = \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{DNA}} - b}{a} = \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{DNA}} - 1.482}{0.040}$$\n\nWe calculate the radii for the two relevant DNA species ($L-L$ and $H-L$):\n\n-   **Radius for $L-L$ DNA ($r_{14,14}$):**\n    Using $\\rho_{14} = 1.710\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mL}^{-1}$:\n    $$r_{14,14} = \\frac{1.710 - 1.482}{0.040} = \\frac{0.228}{0.040} = 5.70\\,\\mathrm{cm}$$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, this is $5.700\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n\n-   **Radius for hybrid $H-L$ DNA ($r_{\\mathrm{hyb}}$):**\n    Using $\\rho_{\\mathrm{hyb}} = 1.717\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mL}^{-1}$:\n    $$r_{\\mathrm{hyb}} = \\frac{1.717 - 1.482}{0.040} = \\frac{0.235}{0.040} = 5.875\\,\\mathrm{cm}$$\n    This value is already expressed with four significant figures.\n\nNote that $r_{14,14} < r_{\\mathrm{hyb}}$, which is consistent with the gradient where density increases with radius.\n\n**Step 5: Assembly of Final Results**\n\nWe now assemble the calculated radii and relative intensities for each generation according to the specified format.\n\n-   **Generation 1:** Only the hybrid band is present.\n    -   $r_{\\mathrm{hyb}} = 5.875\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n    -   $I_{\\mathrm{hyb}} = 1$\n    -   Tuple: $(5.875, 1)$\n\n-   **Generation 2:** Both light and hybrid bands are present.

It presents a simplified but fundamentally correct kinetic model of a real biochemical process—the competition between nucleotide extension and proofreading excision by a DNA polymerase. The assumptions are clearly stated, and the provided data are sufficient and consistent for a unique solution. Therefore, we proceed.\n\nThe task is divided into two parts: first, to derive an analytical expression for the probability of mismatch fixation, $P_{\\mathrm{fix}}$; second, to compute this probability for several specific cases.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of $P_{\\mathrm{fix}}$\n\nWe are given a system in a state where a mismatched nucleotide has been incorporated at the $3^{\\prime}$ primer terminus. From this state, two independent, mutually exclusive first-order processes can occur:\n1. Extension: with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{ext}}$.\n2. Excision (proofreading): with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{exo}}$.\n\nThe problem states that these processes are memoryless. This is the defining characteristic of a Poisson process, which implies that the waiting time for each event follows an exponential distribution. Let $T_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ be the random variable representing the time until extension occurs, and $T_{\\mathrm{exo}}$ be the time until excision occurs.\n\nThe probability density function (PDF) for an exponential distribution with rate parameter $\\lambda$ is $f(t) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda t)$ for $t \\ge 0$.\nThus, the PDF for $T_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ is $f_{\\mathrm{ext}}(t) = k_{\\mathrm{ext}} \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{ext}} t)$, and the PDF for $T_{\\mathrm{exo}}$ is $f_{\\mathrm{exo}}(t) = k_{\\mathrm{exo}} \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{exo}} t)$.\n\nThe probability of mismatch fixation, $P_{\\mathrm{fix}}$, is the probability that the extension event occurs before the excision event, i.e., $P_{\\mathrm{fix}} = P(T_{\\mathrm{ext}} < T_{\\mathrm{exo}})$.\n\nA direct and fundamental way to solve for this probability is to consider the total rate of any event occurring. Since the two pathways are independent, the total rate at which the initial state is resolved is the sum of the individual rates:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{total}} = k_{\\mathrm{ext}} + k_{\\mathrm{exo}}\n$$\nThis total rate, $k_{\\mathrm{total}}$, determines the probability that *any* event occurs in an infinitesimal time interval $dt$, which is $k_{\\mathrm{total}} dt$. The phenomena of extension and excision are in a race. The probability that the event that wins this race is extension is simply the ratio of its rate to the total rate of all competing events.\n\nThis is a general principle for competing, independent first-order processes. The probability of pathway $i$ occurring first from a set of $N$ competing pathways is given by $P_i = k_i / \\sum_{j=1}^{N} k_j$.\n\nIn our case, there are two competing pathways. Therefore, the probability that extension occurs before excision is:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{fix}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{k_{\\mathrm{ext}} + k_{\\mathrm{exo}}}\n$$\nThis expression is the required analytic result. It is dimensionless, as required for a probability, since the units of the rate constants in the numerator and denominator cancel.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of $P_{\\mathrm{fix}}$\n\nWe now apply this formula to the given numerical data for DNA polymerase $\\varepsilon$ (Pol $\\varepsilon$) and DNA polymerase $\\delta$ (Pol $\\delta$).
