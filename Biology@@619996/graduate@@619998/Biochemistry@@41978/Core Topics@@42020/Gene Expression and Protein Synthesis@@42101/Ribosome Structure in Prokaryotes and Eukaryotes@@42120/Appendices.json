The first stack is $5'-\\mathrm{AG}-3'$ on the top strand and $3'-\\mathrm{UC}-5'$ on the bottom strand. The notation for this is $\\mathrm{AG}/\\mathrm{UC}$.\n2.

This specific, stable RNA-RNA interaction serves to recruit the $30\\text{S}$ ribosomal subunit to the vicinity of the correct initiation codon on the mRNA. It anchors the ribosome, thereby stabilizing the bacterial translation initiation complex and ensuring fidelity in the selection of the translational start site.\n\nIn contrast, eukaryotic translation initiation operates via a fundamentally different mechanism. The eukaryotic small ribosomal subunit ($40\\text{S}$) typically recognizes and binds to the $5'$ cap structure of the mRNA, a chemically modified guanine nucleotide. Following binding, the subunit, along with a complex of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), scans linearly along the mRNA in the $5' \\to 3'$ direction until it locates the first AUG start codon, often within a favorable sequence context known as the Kozak consensus sequence. This scanning process is energy-dependent, requiring ATP hydrolysis. Eukaryotes lack the specific, localised RNA-RNA base-pairing interaction analogous to the Shine-Dalgarno system for ribosome recruitment, relying instead on a cap-dependent scanning model for initiation site recognition.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-38.79}\n$$", "id": "2603320"}, {"introduction": "While thermodynamic calculations provide insight into the stability of interactions, experimental methods are needed to observe them directly and detect conformational changes. This problem puts you in the role of an experimental biochemist interpreting chemical footprinting data, a powerful technique used to map the architecture of ribonucleoprotein complexes [@problem_id:2072907]. By analyzing how the reactivity of 16S rRNA to dimethyl sulfate (DMS) changes upon antibiotic binding, you can deduce the molecular mechanism by which drugs like spectinomycin inhibit ribosome function.", "problem": "A biochemist is investigating the mechanism of action of spectinomycin, an antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis in bacteria by binding to the $30\\text{S}$ ribosomal subunit. The focus of the study is on helix 44 (h44) of the $16\\text{S}$ ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a key component of the decoding center. The experiment utilizes chemical footprinting with Dimethyl Sulfate (DMS) to probe the accessibility of RNA bases. DMS is a chemical probe that methylates the Watson-Crick face of accessible nucleotides, specifically the N1 position of adenine (A) and the N3 position of cytosine (C). These positions are typically protected from methylation when involved in base pairing or other tertiary interactions. The sites of methylation are subsequently identified by primer extension analysis, where reverse transcriptase terminates synthesis one nucleotide 3' to the modified base. A decrease in DMS reactivity upon ligand binding is observed as 'protection', indicating the base has become less accessible.\n\nThe experiment is conducted under two conditions: (1) isolated $70\\text{S}$ ribosomes from *E. coli*, and (2) $70\\text{S}$ ribosomes pre-incubated with a saturating concentration of spectinomycin. The following observations are made regarding specific nucleotides in h44:\n\n1.  In the absence of spectinomycin, nucleotide A1408 shows moderate reactivity with DMS.\n2.  In the presence of spectinomycin, the DMS reactivity of A1408 is strongly diminished (i.e., it is protected).\n3.  Nucleotides C1407 and G1494, which form a canonical Watson-Crick base pair adjacent to A1408, are unreactive to DMS in both the presence and absence of spectinomycin.\n4.  A well-known spectinomycin resistance mutation is C1192U, located in a different helix (h34) that is spatially close to the spectinomycin binding pocket.\n\nBased on these experimental results, which of the following conclusions provides the most direct and plausible explanation for the effect of spectinomycin on the ribosome?\n\nA. Spectinomycin binds in a pocket on the $30\\text{S}$ subunit and stabilizes a conformation of h44 where the N1 position of A1408 is no longer solvent-accessible.\n\nB. Spectinomycin causes A1408 to form a new Watson-Crick base pair, thus protecting it from DMS modification.\n\nC. Spectinomycin functions as a competitive inhibitor of DMS, binding covalently to the N1 position of A1408 and preventing methylation.\n\nD. The binding of spectinomycin causes a large-scale dissociation of the $70\\text{S}$ ribosome into its $30\\text{S}$ and $50\\text{S}$ subunits, leading to the protection of A1408.\n\nE. Spectinomycin binding triggers the enzymatic methylation of A1408 by a ribosomal modification enzyme, making the site appear protected from subsequent DMS action.", "solution": "Principles and assay readout:\n- Dimethyl sulfate (DMS) methylates the Watson-Crick face of accessible nucleotides at the N1 position of adenine and the N3 position of cytosine. When these positions are engaged in Watson-Crick base pairing or buried by tertiary interactions, they become less accessible and therefore less reactive to DMS.\n- In primer extension mapping, reverse transcriptase stops one nucleotide 3' of a methylated base, so decreased stop intensity at a given site upon ligand addition is interpreted as protection, i.e., reduced chemical accessibility of that base.\n- Thus, a decrease in DMS reactivity at A indicates either a new base-pairing interaction at the adenine N1 or a ligand-induced conformational or steric change that shields the N1 from solvent, without necessarily creating a canonical base pair.\n\nApplying the observations:\n1. A1408 shows moderate DMS reactivity without spectinomycin. This implies that in the unliganded state, the N1 of A1408 is at least partially solvent-exposed and not strictly sequestered by stable base pairing or tertiary contacts.\n2. In the presence of spectinomycin, A1408 becomes strongly protected. This directly indicates that spectinomycin binding reduces the solvent accessibility of the A1408 N1, either by inducing local conformational rearrangement that buries it or by steric occlusion from the ligand or neighboring RNA/protein elements.\n3. C1407 and G1494 form a canonical Watson-Crick base pair adjacent to A1408 and remain unreactive in both conditions. This indicates that the local canonical base pairing in this segment of h44 is intact and not detectably perturbed by spectinomycin. Therefore, spectinomycin does not globally disrupt the h44 helix nor does it alter the C1407–G1494 pairing state. Any proposed mechanism should be consistent with this stability.\n4. The resistance mutation C1192U in h34 lies near the spectinomycin binding pocket, supporting that spectinomycin binds at the h34–h44 interface and stabilizes a particular conformation of the decoding center.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A: Spectinomycin stabilizes a conformation of h44 in which the N1 of A1408 is not solvent-accessible. This is a direct and parsimonious interpretation of the observed protection of A1408, requires no new base-pair partner, and is fully consistent with the unaltered canonical pairing at C1407–G1494 and with resistance mapping near the binding pocket.\n- Option B: A new Watson-Crick base pair involving A1408 would explain protection but would require identification of a specific partner and a rearrangement sufficient to permit pairing. Such a rearrangement would often have collateral effects on neighboring reactivity patterns. The maintained unreactivity of the adjacent C1407–G1494 pair (and the lack of reported new protections elsewhere) argues against a new canonical pairing of A1408 as the most direct explanation.\n- Option C: Spectinomycin acting as a competitive, covalent inhibitor of DMS at A1408 N1 is chemically implausible. Spectinomycin is not a methylating reagent, does not covalently modify A1408, and its known mechanism involves noncovalent binding to the $30\\text{S}$ subunit.\n- Option D: Dissociation of the 70S into subunits is not supported by these site-specific protection data and is not a known primary effect of spectinomycin at saturating concentrations under standard conditions. Moreover, dissociation would not selectively protect A1408 while leaving adjacent canonical pairing unchanged.\n- Option E: Enzymatic methylation of A1408 induced by spectinomycin is not supported by known rRNA modification pathways in this context. If A1408 were enzymatically methylated, primer extension stops would be observed even in the absence of DMS, and the pattern would not present simply as DMS protection upon ligand addition.\n\nConclusion:\nThe observation that A1408 becomes protected upon spectinomycin binding, while the adjacent canonical base pair remains unchanged and a resistance mutation maps near the binding pocket, is most directly and plausibly explained by spectinomycin stabilizing a conformation of h44 that reduces solvent access to the N1 of A1408.

This advanced problem challenges you to engage with this cutting-edge concept by interpreting a complex, multi-omics dataset testing the role of rRNA modifications in translational control [@problem_id:2072925]. By comparing translational efficiencies between wild-type and knockout cells under stress, you will learn to connect specific molecular changes in the ribosome to system-wide shifts in protein synthesis, a key skill in modern molecular biology.", "problem": "The \"specialized ribosome\" hypothesis posits that heterogeneous populations of ribosomes, differing in their protein composition or ribosomal RNA (rRNA) modifications, can exist within a cell and exhibit preferential translation of specific subsets of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). A key area of investigation is the role of post-transcriptional modifications of rRNA, such as pseudouridylation ($\\Psi$), in regulating translation during cellular stress.\n\nConsider an experiment designed to test this hypothesis in human cells undergoing an Integrated Stress Response (ISR) induced by oxidative stress. The focus is on a specific, stress-inducible pseudouridylation at uridine 1248 (U1248) within the $18\\text{S}$ rRNA, located near the mRNA entry channel of the ribosome. This modification is catalyzed by the enzyme PUS7. The experiment aims to link this modification to the translational control of two representative genes:\n1.  **ATF4**: A critical ISR transcription factor whose mRNA contains an Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES), allowing for cap-independent translation initiation, a common feature for stress-response genes.\n2.  **GAPDH**: A housekeeping gene translated via the canonical 5' cap-dependent mechanism.\n\nThe experiment utilizes two cell lines: a standard Wild-Type (WT) line and a genetically engineered PUS7 Knockout (PUS7-KO) line, in which the PUS7 gene is non-functional. Both cell lines are subjected to either control conditions or oxidative stress.\n\nFor each of the four experimental conditions (WT/Control, WT/Stress, PUS7-KO/Control, PUS7-KO/Stress), the Translational Efficiency (TE) for both ATF4 and GAPDH mRNAs was quantified. TE is a measure of ribosome loading on an mRNA, calculated as the ratio of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments (measured via ribosome profiling) to the total abundance of that mRNA transcript (measured via RNA sequencing). A higher TE value indicates that, on average, more protein is being synthesized per mRNA molecule.\n\nThe resulting TE values are as follows:\n\n-   **WT, Control**: ATF4 TE = 0.2; GAPDH TE = 5.0\n-   **WT, Stress**: ATF4 TE = 4.0; GAPDH TE = 1.0\n-   **PUS7-KO, Control**: ATF4 TE = 0.2; GAPDH TE = 5.1\n-   **PUS7-KO, Stress**: ATF4 TE = 0.8; GAPDH TE = 0.9\n\nBased on this dataset, which of the following conclusions provides the most accurate and specific interpretation of the functional role of PUS7-mediated pseudouridylation at site U1248 during the oxidative stress response?\n\nA. Stress-induced pseudouridylation at site U1248 is the primary mechanism responsible for the global shutdown of cap-dependent translation observed during the Integrated Stress Response.\n\nB. The presence of PUS7-mediated pseudouridylation at U1248 is, by itself, sufficient to cause high translational efficiency of ATF4 mRNA, irrespective of cellular stress conditions.\n\nC. Stress-induced hyper-pseudouridylation at site U1248, mediated by PUS7, is necessary for the robust and preferential translational upregulation of the IRES-containing ATF4 mRNA.\n\nD. The PUS7-mediated modification at U1248 is absolutely essential for any translation of ATF4 mRNA, as its absence in the PUS7-KO line completely ablates ATF4 protein synthesis under stress.\n\nE. The primary function of pseudouridylation at U1248 is to specifically destabilize the GAPDH mRNA transcript under stress, leading to its reduced translational efficiency.", "solution": "We are given translational efficiency (TE) values for two mRNAs, ATF4 and GAPDH, across four experimental conditions: WT/Control, WT/Stress, PUS7-KO/Control, and PUS7-KO/Stress.

Claims the stress-induced pseudouridylation at U1248 is the primary mechanism for global shutdown of cap-dependent translation. The data show GAPDH TE decreases under stress in both WT and PUS7-KO by similar factors (WT: $0.2$, KO: $\\frac{3}{17}$), demonstrating that the global suppression of cap-dependent translation proceeds without PUS7. Therefore, A is not supported.\n\nB. Claims PUS7-mediated pseudouridylation is sufficient to cause high ATF4 TE irrespective of stress. In WT control, ATF4 TE is $0.2$ despite the presence of PUS7; high ATF4 TE ($4.0$) only occurs under stress. Therefore, B is false.\n\nC. Claims stress-induced hyper-pseudouridylation at U1248 via PUS7 is necessary for robust and preferential translational upregulation of IRES-containing ATF4 mRNA. The data show robust upregulation in WT upon stress (20-fold) and markedly reduced upregulation in PUS7-KO (4-fold), with stressed KO ATF4 TE reduced by a factor of $5$ relative to stressed WT. Preferential translation relative to GAPDH is striking in WT stress ($4$ versus $0.04$ in control, a $100$-fold increase), but much weaker in KO stress ($\\frac{8}{9}$). This supports that PUS7 activity is necessary for robust and preferential ATF4 translational upregulation during stress. Therefore, C is supported.\n\nD. Claims PUS7 modification is absolutely essential for any ATF4 translation under stress. However, PUS7-KO stress shows ATF4 TE $0.8$, indicating significant translation remains. Therefore, D is false.\n\nE. Claims the primary function at U1248 is to specifically destabilize GAPDH mRNA under stress, leading to reduced TE. TE is a measure of translation efficiency, not directly mRNA stability, and GAPDH TE decreases similarly in PUS7-KO, arguing against a specific role for U1248 modification in GAPDH reduction.
