This phenomenon, where the catalytic readout amplifies cooperativity by filtering out partially active or inactive states, is a form of kinetic proofreading. The enzyme's activity is gated not just by the $T \\leftrightarrow R$ transition but also by the requirement of full saturation of the active $R$ state.
