It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in elementary biochemical kinetics, free of ambiguity or contradiction.

The number of moles, $n$, of a species $X$ in a volume $V_{X}$ at a concentration $[X]$ is given by $n_{X} = [X] \\cdot V_{X}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles of enzyme, $n_{E}$. The enzyme is only present in Syringe A.\n$$n_{E} = [E]_{\\mathrm{A}} \\cdot V_{\\mathrm{A}} = (2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) \\cdot V$$\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles of substrate, $n_{S}$.

The elementary steps are defined as:\n$$ E + L \\underset{k_{\\text{off}}}{\\stackrel{k_{\\text{on}}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} EL $$\nwhere $k_{\\text{on}}$ is the second-order association rate constant and $k_{\\text{off}}$ is the first-order dissociation rate constant.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the rate of change of the complex concentration, $[EL]$, is given by:\n$$ \\frac{d[EL]}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}}[E][L] - k_{\\text{off}}[EL] $$\n\nThe total concentration of the protein, $[E]_0$, is conserved throughout the reaction:\n$$ [E]_0 = [E] + [EL] $$\nTherefore, the concentration of free protein at any time $t$ is $[E] = [E]_0 - [EL]$. Substituting this into the rate equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{d[EL]}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}}([E]_0 - [EL])[L] - k_{\\text{off}}[EL] $$\n\nThe experiment is conducted under pseudo-first-order conditions, where the ligand concentration is much greater than the protein concentration, $[L] \\gg [E]$. This implies that the concentration of the free ligand, $[L]$, remains approximately constant throughout the binding phase and is equal to its initial total concentration, $[L]_0$. We can thus treat $[L]$ as a constant parameter.\n\nRearranging the rate equation:\n$$ \\frac{d[EL]}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}}[E]_0[L] - k_{\\text{on}}[EL][L] - k_{\\text{off}}[EL] $$\n$$ \\frac{d[EL]}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}}[E]_0[L] - (k_{\\text{on}}[L] + k_{\\text{off}})[EL] $$\n\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $[EL]$. The transient phase of the reaction, where $[EL]$ approaches its equilibrium value, follows a single exponential time course.

A plot of $k_{\\text{obs}}$ versus $[L]$ yields a straight line. By comparing this equation to the standard linear form $y = mx + c$, we can identify the kinetic parameters from the experimental plot:\n- The slope, $m$, corresponds to the association rate constant, $k_{\\text{on}}$.\n- The y-intercept, $c$, corresponds to the dissociation rate constant, $k_{\\text{off}}$.\n\nThe problem provides the results of a linear fit:\n- Slope $= 8 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}$\n- Intercept $= 12 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$\n\nFrom these data, we directly determine the elementary rate constants:\n$$ k_{\\text{on}} = 8 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ k_{\\text{off}} = 12 \\, \\text{s}^{-1} $$\n\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D$, is defined thermodynamically as $\\frac{[E]_{eq}[L]_{eq}}{[EL]_{eq}}$.

The rate of a diffusion-controlled bimolecular reaction in aqueous solution is limited by the frequency with which reactants encounter each other by diffusion. The corresponding rate constant, $k_{\\text{on}}$, typically falls in the range of $10^8$ to $10^{10} \\, \\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}$.

All provided data are consistent and physically plausible. We may therefore proceed with a direct analysis.\n\nThe system is described by a two-step catalytic mechanism under saturating substrate conditions. This can be represented as:\n$$ E_{act} \\cdot S \\xrightarrow{k_{fast}} E' + P $$\n$$ E' \\xrightarrow{k_{slow}} E_{act} $$\nHere, $E_{act}$ is the catalytically competent form of the enzyme, $S$ is the substrate, $P$ is the product, and $E'$ is an intermediate enzyme form. The first step, with rate constant $k_{fast}$, is rapid and leads to the formation of one molecule of product per active site. The second step, with rate constant $k_{slow}$, is a slower process that regenerates the active enzyme form. The time course of product formation, $[P](t)$, exhibits two distinct phases: an initial rapid \"burst\" followed by a slower linear \"steady-state\" phase.\n\nFirst, we address the fraction of active enzyme sites, denoted $f_{\\mathrm{act}}$.\nThe pre-steady-state burst phase corresponds to the first turnover of all catalytically competent enzyme molecules. The problem states that \"each catalytically competent active site contributes one product molecule rapidly during the burst.\" Therefore, the amplitude of this burst, $A$, is a direct stoichiometric measure of the concentration of active enzyme sites, $[E]_{\\mathrm{act}}$.\n$$ A = [E]_{\\mathrm{act}} $$\nThe problem provides the burst amplitude as $A = 0.8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and the total enzyme concentration as $[E]_0 = 1.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.

In this phase, the overall rate of product formation is limited by the slowest step in the catalytic cycle. The observed linear rate, $v_{ss}$, is this steady-state velocity. The velocity is the product of the rate constant of the rate-limiting step and the concentration of the species undergoing that step. In the steady state of this mechanism, nearly all active enzyme is sequestered as the intermediate $E'$ because its regeneration ($k_{slow}$) is the bottleneck. Thus, $[E'] \\approx [E]_{\\mathrm{act}}$.\nThe steady-state velocity is given by:\n$$ v_{ss} = k_{slow} [E'] \\approx k_{slow} [E]_{\\mathrm{act}} $$\nThe turnover number, $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$, is defined as the rate of catalysis per active enzyme site under saturating substrate conditions. This corresponds precisely to the rate constant of the rate-limiting step in the cycle, so $k_{\\mathrm{cat}} = k_{slow}$. Therefore, we can write:\n$$ v_{ss} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_{\\mathrm{act}} $$\nSolving for $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ and using $[E]_{\\mathrm{act}} = A$, we find:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{cat}} = \\frac{v_{ss}}{[E]_{\\mathrm{act}}} = \\frac{v_{ss}}{A} $$\nThe data provided are a steady linear slope of $v_{ss} = 0.02\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and a burst amplitude of $A = 0.8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{cat}} = \\frac{0.02\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{0.02}{0.8}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 0.025\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n\nThird, we identify the rate-limiting step at steady state.\nThe existence of a pre-steady-state burst is a definitive indicator that the catalytic cycle involves at least one step that is significantly faster than the overall turnover rate. The burst itself is the result of the rapid first step ($k_{fast}$) proceeding once for every active enzyme molecule. After this initial rapid production, the system must wait for the completion of the slowest step in the cycle before another turnover can begin. This slowest step thus becomes the bottleneck, or rate-limiting step, for the steady-state reaction. The problem explicitly describes a \"rapid chemical step\" followed by a \"slower step that returns the enzyme to a form competent for another turnover.\" It is this second, slower regeneration step (with rate constant $k_{slow} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} = 0.025\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) that limits the overall rate of catalysis during the steady-state phase. The rapid chemical step is, by definition, not rate-limiting for turnover.\n\nThe final answer required is the numerical value for the fraction of active enzyme sites, $f_{\\mathrm{act}}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.800}$$", "id": "2588489"}]}
