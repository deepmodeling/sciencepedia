Gibbs free energy is a state function, which means the free energy change of an overall reaction is the sum of the free energy changes of its constituent steps. For two coupled reactions, the overall reaction is the sum of the individual reactions.\n\n$$\n\\text{Overall Reaction: } \\mathrm{E}^{-} + \\mathrm{CO_2} + \\mathrm{ATP} + \\mathrm{H_2O} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{ECOO}^{-} + \\mathrm{ADP} + \\mathrm{P_i}\n$$\n\nDue to the additive property of Gibbs free energy, the standard transformed free energy change for this overall coupled reaction is:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\mathrm{overall}} = \\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\mathrm{carb}} + \\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\mathrm{ATP}}\n$$\nThis additive relationship can also be derived from the equilibrium constants. The relationship between the standard free energy change and the equilibrium constant is $\\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime} = -RT \\ln K^{\\prime}$.

The overall free energy change is then:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\mathrm{overall}} = -RT \\ln(K^{\\prime}_{\\mathrm{overall}}) = -RT \\ln(K^{\\prime}_{\\mathrm{carb}} \\times K^{\\prime}_{\\mathrm{ATP}}) = -RT(\\ln K^{\\prime}_{\\mathrm{carb}} + \\ln K^{\\prime}_{\\mathrm{ATP}})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\mathrm{overall}} = (-RT \\ln K^{\\prime}_{\\mathrm{carb}}) + (-RT \\ln K^{\\prime}_{\\mathrm{ATP}}) = \\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\mathrm{carb}} + \\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\mathrm{ATP}}\n$$\nThis confirms the additivity. Since the carboxylation reaction is unfavorable ($\\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\mathrm{carb}} = +36.70\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} > 0$), its equilibrium constant $K^{\\prime}_{\\mathrm{carb}}$ is much less than $1$. The hydrolysis of ATP is highly favorable ($\\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\mathrm{ATP}} < 0$), so its equilibrium constant $K^{\\prime}_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$ is much greater than $1$. Coupling is effective because the addition of the large, negative $\\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$ to the positive $\\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\mathrm{carb}}$ can result in an overall negative $\\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\mathrm{overall}}$, thereby making the net process spontaneous under standard conditions. The large equilibrium constant of ATP hydrolysis effectively pulls the unfavorable carboxylation reaction to completion.\n\nNext, we must determine the minimum value of $\\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$ required for the overall process to be thermodynamically feasible. The condition for feasibility is that the overall standard transformed free energy change must be non-positive, i.e., $\\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\mathrm{overall}} \\le 0$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for the sum of free energies:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\mathrm{carb}} + \\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\mathrm{ATP}} \\le 0\n$$\nWe can rearrange this inequality to find the constraint on $\\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\mathrm{ATP}} \\le - \\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\mathrm{carb}}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the \"minimum value\" of $\\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$ that satisfies this condition. Since $\\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$ is a negative quantity, a more negative value is algebraically smaller. However, the context of \"minimum requirement\" in thermodynamics refers to the threshold value at which the condition is met. This corresponds to the boundary case of equilibrium, where $\\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\mathrm{overall}} = 0$. This value represents the least exergonic (i.e., algebraically maximum) value of $\\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$ that makes the reaction feasible. Any more exergonic (more negative) value will also render the reaction feasible.

We apply this approximation to the concentrations of the intermediate enzyme forms. The total enzyme concentration, $[E_t]$, is the sum of the concentrations of all enzyme species: $[E_t] = [E] + [F] + [EA] + [FB]$. Under the simplifying assumption of rapid equilibrium for substrate binding and irreversible catalysis, we can consider the two main forms $E$ and $F$ (which include their substrate-bound complexes, $EA$ and $FB$ respectively, in a more detailed derivation, but let us use the simpler steady-state treatment on the modified enzyme forms $E$ and $F$).\n\nThe rate of the first half-reaction, $v_1$, is the rate of formation of $F$ (and product $P$). The rate of the second half-reaction, $v_2$, is the rate of regeneration of $E$ (and formation of product $Q$). At steady-state, these rates must be equal to the overall initial velocity, $v_0$.\n$$ v_1 = v_2 = v_0 $$\nThe rates of the individual half-reactions can be described by the Michaelis-Menten equation, where $[E]$ and $[F]$ are the concentrations of the respective enzyme forms available for each half-reaction. Let $k_{p1}$ and $k_{p2}$ be the catalytic constants for the first and second half-reactions, respectively.\n$$ v_0 = \\frac{k_{p1}[E][A]}{K'_{M,A} + [A]} $$\n$$ v_0 = \\frac{k_{p2}[F][B]}{K'_{M,B} + [B]} $$\nHere, $K'_{M,A}$ and $K'_{M,B}$ are the Michaelis constants for the individual half-reactions.

The observation of a burst phase in product formation indicates that one part of the catalytic cycle is significantly faster than another. In a ping-pong mechanism, the burst corresponds to the first half-reaction ($E+A \\rightarrow F+P$) occurring rapidly for the entire initial enzyme population, $[E_t]$, before the reaction settles into a slower steady-state limited by the regeneration of the $E$ form.\nThe rate constant of the burst phase, $k_{burst}$, corresponds to the catalytic rate constant of the first half-reaction under saturating conditions, so $k_{burst} = k_{p1}$. We are given $k_{burst} = 300\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, so $k_{p1} = 300\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nThe steady-state turnover number, $k_{cat}$, is determined by the rates of both half-reactions according to the relation $\\frac{1}{k_{cat}} = \\frac{1}{k_{p1}} + \\frac{1}{k_{p2}}$.\nWe are given $k_{cat} = 120\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Since $k_{cat} < k_{burst}$, it is clear that the first half-reaction is not the sole rate-limiting step of the entire cycle. The overall rate is limited by the slower of the two half-reactions. We can calculate the rate constant for the second half-reaction, $k_{p2}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{120\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{1}{300\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} + \\frac{1}{k_{p2}} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{k_{p2}} = \\frac{1}{120} - \\frac{1}{300} = \\frac{5 - 2}{600} = \\frac{3}{600} = \\frac{1}{200} $$\nThus, $k_{p2} = 200\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nComparing the catalytic constants for the two half-reactions, we have $k_{p1} = 300\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $k_{p2} = 200\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Since $k_{p2} < k_{p1}$, the second half-reaction ($F+B \\rightarrow E+Q$) is slower and is therefore the rate-limiting step under saturating substrate conditions.
