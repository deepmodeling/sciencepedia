For a bi-substrate reaction where $[A]$ is varied at a fixed concentration of $[B]$, the general form of the LB equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{v_0} = (\\text{Slope}) \\frac{1}{[A]} + (\\text{Y-Intercept})\n$$\nThe expressions for the slope and intercept depend on the reaction mechanism. For this analysis, we do not presuppose a mechanism but rather deduce it from the graphical pattern.\n\nFirst, we transform the given data into reciprocal coordinates $(1/[A], 1/v_0)$. Concentrations are in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, velocities in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The units for $1/[A]$ are $(\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{-1}$ and for $1/v_0$ are $\\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\n**Dataset 1: Fixed $[B] = 25 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{M}$**\n- $1/[A] = 1/20 = 0.050$, $1/v_0 = 1/0.142857 \\approx 7.000$\n- $1/[A] = 1/50 = 0.020$, $1/v_0 = 1/0.181818 \\approx 5.500$\n- $1/[A] = 1/100 = 0.010$, $1/v_0 = 1/0.200000 = 5.000$\n- $1/[A] = 1/300 \\approx 0.00333$, $1/v_0 = 1/0.214286 \\approx 4.667$\nA linear fit to these points $(x,y)$ where $x = 1/[A]$ and $y = 1/v_0$ yields the equation $y = m x + c$. The slope is $m = (7.0 - 5.0) / (0.050 - 0.010) = 2.0 / 0.040 = 50$. The intercept is $c = 5.0 - 50 \\times 0.010 = 4.5$.

The intercept is $c = 1.5 - 50 \\times 0.010 = 1.0$. The line is $\\frac{1}{v_0} = 50 \\frac{1}{[A]} + 1.0$.\n\nThe family of LB plots consists of three lines with the same slope ($50$) but different y-intercepts ($4.5$, $2.5$, and $1.0$). A pattern of parallel lines is the definitive diagnostic signature of a Ping-Pong (or double-displacement) kinetic mechanism.\n\nFor a Ping-Pong mechanism, the rate equation is:\n$$\nv_0 = \\frac{V_{\\max}[A][B]}{K_{m,A}[B] + K_{m,B}[A] + [A][B]}\n$$\nThe corresponding Lineweaver-Burk equation, when $[A]$ is the variable substrate, is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{v_0} = \\left(\\frac{K_{m,A}}{V_{\\max}}\\right) \\frac{1}{[A]} + \\frac{1}{V_{\\max}}\\left(1 + \\frac{K_{m,B}}{[B]}\\right)\n$$\nFrom this theoretical equation, the slope of the LB plot is $K_{m,A}/V_{\\max}$, which is independent of $[B]$. This matches our empirical observation of a constant slope. The y-intercept is $(1/V_{\\max})(1 + K_{m,B}/[B])$, which depends on $[B]$.\n\nTo determine the kinetic constants, we perform a secondary replot of the y-intercepts of the primary plots versus $1/[B]$. Let $I$ be the y-intercept. The equation for the secondary replot is:\n$$\nI = \\left(\\frac{K_{m,B}}{V_{\\max}}\\right) \\frac{1}{[B]} + \\frac{1}{V_{\\max}}\n$$\nThis is a linear equation. We have the following data points for the secondary plot $(1/[B], I)$:\n- From Dataset 1: $1/[B] = 1/25 = 0.04 \\, (\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{-1}$, $I = 4.5 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- From Dataset 2: $1/[B] = 1/50 = 0.02 \\, (\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{-1}$, $I = 2.5 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- From Dataset 3: $1/[B] = 1/200 = 0.005 \\, (\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{-1}$, $I = 1.0 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\nThe slope of this secondary plot is $(4.5 - 2.5) / (0.04 - 0.02) = 2.0 / 0.02 = 100$.\nThis slope corresponds to $K_{m,B}/V_{\\max}$. So, $K_{m,B}/V_{\\max} = 100 \\, \\mathrm{s}$.\nThe y-intercept of the secondary plot is found by extrapolating to $1/[B] = 0$. Using the point $(0.02, 2.5)$: $2.5 = 100 \\times 0.02 + \\text{intercept} \\implies \\text{intercept} = 2.5 - 2.0 = 0.5$.\nThis y-intercept corresponds to $1/V_{\\max}$.\nSo, $1/V_{\\max} = 0.5 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\nFrom this we determine $V_{\\max} = 1/0.5 = 2.0 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nNow we can determine the Michaelis constants:\n- From the primary plot slope: $K_{m,A}/V_{\\max} = 50 \\, \\mathrm{s}$.\n  $K_{m,A} = (50 \\, \\mathrm{s}) \\times V_{\\max} = (50 \\, \\mathrm{s}) \\times (2.0 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = 100 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n- From the secondary plot slope: $K_{m,B}/V_{\\max} = 100 \\, \\mathrm{s}$.\n  $K_{m,B} = (100 \\, \\mathrm{s}) \\times V_{\\max} = (100 \\, \\mathrm{s}) \\times (2.0 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = 200 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nThe final task is to calculate the catalytic turnover number, $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$.
