Resonance Raman spectroscopy is a standard method for probing the active sites of metalloproteins like heme proteins. The vibrational modes $\\nu_{3}$ and $\\nu_{4}$ of the porphyrin macrocycle are well-established empirical markers for the spin state and oxidation state of the central iron atom, respectively. The provided frequency ranges are consistent with decades of published literature in biophysical chemistry. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and clear rules for interpretation, leading to a unique solution. The data are internally consistent and realistic. The problem relies on objective, verifiable facts, not speculation.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in interpreting vibrational spectroscopic data using established structure-spectra correlations. A proper analysis requires understanding the physical origin of these correlations, not merely a mechanical application of rules.\n\nThe vibrational frequency, $\\nu$, of a molecular mode is fundamentally related to the force constant of the bonds involved, $k$, and the reduced mass of the oscillating atoms, $\\mu$, approximately as $\\nu \\propto \\sqrt{k/\\mu}$. For the porphyrin macrocycle, the frequencies of in-plane skeletal modes such as $\\nu_{3}$ and $\\nu_{4}$ are sensitive to changes in the $\\pi$-electron distribution and geometry of the macrocycle, which are in turn governed by the central iron's oxidation and spin state.\n\n**Analysis of the Oxidation-State Marker $\\nu_{4}$**\nThe $\\nu_{4}$ mode primarily involves symmetric breathing of the methine bridges ($\\text{C}_{\\alpha}-\\text{C}_{m}-\\text{C}_{\\alpha}$) of the porphyrin. Its frequency is highly sensitive to the $\\pi$-electron density in the porphyrin ring. A more electrophilic (electron-withdrawing) central metal ion will withdraw electron density from the porphyrin's $\\pi$ system. Specifically, it can depopulate the highest occupied $\\pi$-orbitals ($a_{1u}$, $a_{2u}$) or, more significantly, accept back-donation into the porphyrin's lowest unoccupied $\\pi^*$ orbitals ($e_g$). Both effects, particularly the latter, increase the net bond order within the porphyrin skeleton. An increase in bond order corresponds to a larger force constant $k$, and thus a higher vibrational frequency.\n\nThe ferric ion, $\\text{Fe}^{3+}$, is more electrophilic than the ferrous ion, $\\text{Fe}^{2+}$. Consequently, $\\text{Fe}^{3+}$ withdraws more electron density, leading to stronger skeletal bonds and a higher $\\nu_{4}$ frequency. The provided calibration, where $\\text{Fe}^{3+}$ hemes exhibit $\\nu_{4}$ in the $1368$–$1375\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ range and $\\text{Fe}^{2+}$ hemes in the $1352$–$1362\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ range, is a direct consequence of this electronic effect.\n\n**Analysis of the Spin-State Marker $\\nu_{3}$**\nThe $\\nu_{3}$ mode involves primarily symmetric vibrations of the outer part of the pyrrole rings. Its frequency is exquisitely sensitive to the size of the iron's coordination cavity, which is dictated by the iron's spin state. The spin state determines the occupancy of the $d$-orbitals. In a high-spin configuration (e.g., $S=5/2$ for $\\text{Fe}^{3+}$ or $S=2$ for $\\text{Fe}^{2+}$), electrons occupy the antibonding $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. The presence of an electron in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, which points directly at the pyrrole nitrogens, sterically expands the porphyrin core. This forces the iron atom out of the porphyrin plane, causing the macrocycle to dome. This doming reduces the $\\pi$-conjugation across the porphyrin skeleton, weakening the bonds, decreasing the force constant $k$, and thus lowering the $\\nu_{3}$ frequency.\n\nIn a low-spin configuration (e.g., $S=1/2$ for $\\text{Fe}^{3+}$ or $S=0$ for $\\text{Fe}^{2+}$), the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital is unoccupied. The iron ion is smaller and can sit neatly within the plane of the porphyrin ring, resulting in a planar conformation. This planarity maximizes $\\pi$-conjugation, strengthens the skeletal bonds, increases the force constant $k$, and elevates the $\\nu_{3}$ frequency.\n\nThis physical principle explains the empirical rule: high-spin hemes have lower $\\nu_{3}$ frequencies ($1470$–$1480\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$) than low-spin hemes ($1500$–$1512\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$).\n\nNow, we apply this reasoning to the given data.\n\n**Assignment for Sample X**\n- The observed $\\nu_{4}$ is $1356\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$. This value falls squarely within the range for ferrous heme ($1352$–$1362\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$) and is far from the ferric range. Thus, the iron in Sample X is in the $\\text{Fe}^{2+}$ oxidation state.\n- The observed $\\nu_{3}$ is $1473\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$. This value is well within the range for high-spin heme ($1470$–$1480\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$) and far from the low-spin range. Thus, the heme in Sample X is in a high-spin state.\n- Conclusion for Sample X: **Ferrous high-spin** ($\\text{Fe}^{2+}$, $S=2$).\n\n**Assignment for Sample Y**\n- The observed $\\nu_{4}$ is $1371\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$. This value is definitively in the range for ferric heme ($1368$–$1375\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$). Thus, the iron in Sample Y is in the $\\text{Fe}^{3+}$ oxidation state.\n- The observed $\\nu_{3}$ is $1505\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$. This value is firmly in the range for low-spin heme ($1500$–$1512\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$). Thus, the heme in Sample Y is in a low-spin state.\n- Conclusion for Sample Y: **Ferric low-spin** ($\\text{Fe}^{3+}$, $S=1/2$).\n\nThe overall assignment is: Sample X is ferrous high-spin and Sample Y is ferric low-spin. We will now evaluate the given options.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n- **A. Sample X: ferrous high-spin; Sample Y: ferric low-spin.**\nThis statement perfectly matches our derived assignment for both samples based on the provided data and fundamental principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. Sample X: ferric high-spin; Sample Y: ferrous low-spin.**\nThis statement incorrectly assigns the oxidation state for both samples and the spin state for both samples.

It provides a valid basis for a rigorous scientific analysis. Therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Solution\n\nThe analysis proceeds by interpreting the EPR signature of each sample in the context of the two possible spin states for ferric heme: high-spin ($S=5/2$) and low-spin ($S=1/2$).\n\n**Analysis of High-Spin ($S=5/2$) Ferric Heme**\nA high-spin $d^5$ system has a $^6A_1$ ground state, which is split by the zero-field splitting (ZFS) terms $D$ and $E$ into three Kramers doublets. The EPR transitions are observed within the lowest-energy doublet. The effective $g$-values are highly sensitive to the rhombicity parameter, $E/D$.\n-   If symmetry is axial ($E/D=0$), the lowest doublet gives rise to a characteristic spectrum with $g_{\\perp} \\approx 6$ and $g_{\\parallel} \\approx 2$. This is induced by weak-field ligands, such as $H_2O$ or $OH^-$.\n-   If symmetry is highly rhombic ($E/D$ approaches its maximum value of $1/3$), the $g$-values can be very different. For small ZFS parameter $D$, the spectrum can show three widely separated resonances.\n\n**Analysis of Low-Spin ($S=1/2$) Ferric Heme**\nA low-spin $d^5$ system has a $(t_{2g})^5$ electronic configuration and a true spin of $S=1/2$. The ZFS parameters are zero ($D=E=0$). The EPR spectrum is described by three principal components of the $g$-tensor ($g_z, g_y, g_x$). The values of these components are diagnostic of the axial ligands.\n-   **Bis-imidazole ligation**: These are strong-field ligands, leading to a largely spread, highly anisotropic set of $g$-values. Typical values are $g_z \\sim 2.8 - 3.1$, $g_y \\sim 2.2 - 2.3$, $g_x \\sim 1.5 - 1.7$. This is known as a Highly Anisotropic Low-Spin (HALS) signal.\n-   **Anionic thiolate ligation (from cysteine)**: The strong $\\sigma$- and $\\pi$-donation from the sulfur ligand results in a characteristic \"rhombic\" low-spin signal with $g$-values that are more compressed around $g=2$: $g_z \\sim 2.4$, $g_y \\sim 2.25$, $g_x \\sim 1.9$. This is the signature of cytochrome P450-type centers.\n\nBased on these principles, we analyze each sample:\n\n-   **Sample I**: The data show three resonances and a reported $E/D \\approx 0.33$. The presence of ZFS parameters ($D,E$) definitively identifies this as a system with $S \\geq 1$, which for ferric heme is the high-spin $S=5/2$ state. The rhombicity $E/D \\approx 0.33$ is maximal, indicating a highly distorted, non-axial ligand field. Such a spectrum is characteristic of a \"rhombic high-spin\" heme, which arises from a weak-field ligand set in a low-symmetry environment. An aquo or hydroxo ligand is a canonical weak-field ligand.\n    *   **Assignment**: High-spin ($S=5/2$) ferric heme, rhombic ZFS, weak-field ligation.\n\n-   **Sample II**: The data are given as three principal $g$-values $(2.93, 2.26, 1.50)$ without mention of ZFS. This is the signature of a low-spin $S=1/2$ system. The large anisotropy, with $g_z$ near $3.0$ and $g_x$ near $1.5$, is the classic hallmark of a HALS signal, which is characteristic of hexa-coordination with two strong-field neutral nitrogen donors, such as two imidazole groups from histidine residues.\n    *   **Assignment**: Low-spin ($S=1/2$) ferric heme, bis-imidazole-like ligation.\n\n-   **Sample III**: The data are again three principal $g$-values $(2.43, 2.25, 1.92)$, indicating a low-spin $S=1/2$ system. The pattern of these values is distinct from Sample II. They are significantly more compressed around $g=2$. This specific set of values is the textbook signature for a low-spin ferric heme with a proximal anionic thiolate (cysteinate) ligand, as found in cytochrome P450s.\n    *   **Assignment**: Low-spin ($S=1/2$) ferric heme, anionic cysteinate (thiolate) ligation.\n\n-   **Sample IV**: The data show two prominent features at $g \\approx 6.00$ and $g \\approx 1.98$, with a reported rhombicity of $E/D \\approx 0.02$. The signals at $g \\approx 6$ and $g \\approx 2$ are the canonical spectrum of an axial high-spin ($S=5/2$) ferric heme. The very small $E/D$ value confirms the nearly perfect axial symmetry of the ligand field. This spin state is induced by weak-field ligands, typically water or hydroxide.\n    *   **Assignment**: High-spin ($S=5/2$) ferric heme, nearly axial symmetry, weak-field ligation.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nNow we evaluate the provided options against these derived assignments.\n\n-   **Option A**:\n    -   Sample I: `high-spin ferric heme with rhombic zero-field splitting, weak-field aquo/hydroxo distal ligand`.

This is incorrect. Thiolate is a strong-field ligand that induces a low-spin state, contrary to the high-spin nature of Sample I.\n    -   Sample III: `...with bis-imidazole ligation`.

Establish the presence of a thiolate trans ligand by forming a ferrous–$\\mathrm{CO}$ adduct and comparing IR $\\nu(\\mathrm{C}\\equiv\\mathrm{O})$ to a histidine-bound reference: stronger $\\pi$ backbonding from an anionic thiolate should increase $\\nu(\\mathrm{C}\\equiv\\mathrm{O})$ by approximately $+30\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ relative to histidine. The ${}^{13}\\mathrm{CO}$ band should upshift by approximately $+45\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ because ${}^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ increases the force constant. EPR at $10\\ \\text{K}$ on the ferric precursor is expected to be silent for high-spin ferric centers because of rapid relaxation.\n\nD. Differentiate ferric versus ferrous by $\\mathrm{NO}$ binding and EPR: low-spin ferrous–$\\mathrm{NO}$ will show a strong EPR at $g \\approx 2.00$, while low-spin ferric–$\\mathrm{NO}$ will be EPR silent at $10\\ \\text{K}$. In the IR, assign nitrosyl by a band near $2100\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ that shifts up by approximately $+30\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ with ${}^{15}\\mathrm{NO}$. In UV–vis, expect that moving from high-spin to low-spin ferric causes a large blue-shift of the Soret by approximately $40\\ \\text{nm}$ due to increased ligand field splitting.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated for validity prior to attempting a solution.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   System: A newly synthesized iron porphyrin complex, designated a `Fe–Por`.\n-   Conditions: Isolated under strictly anaerobic conditions.\n-   Unknowns: The complex's oxidation state, spin state, and axial ligation.\n-   Available techniques: Ultraviolet–visible absorption spectroscopy (UV–vis), infrared spectroscopy (IR) with isotopic substitution, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) at low temperature.\n-   Objective: Design a measurement sequence to distinguish among $3$ plausible structures.\n-   Plausible structures:\n    (i) A five-coordinate high-spin ferric center ($Fe^{3+}$, $S=5/2$) with a single weak-field axial ligand.\n    (ii) A six-coordinate low-spin ferric center ($Fe^{3+}$, $S=1/2$) with a strong-field anionic ligand.\n    (iii) A six-coordinate low-spin ferrous carbonyl adduct ($Fe^{2+}$-CO, $S=0$).\n-   Required reasoning principles: Ligand field splitting versus pairing energy, EPR selection rules, and the harmonic oscillator model for vibrational frequencies.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is rooted in the established principles of bioinorganic chemistry and spectroscopy. The task is a standard characterization problem in coordination chemistry, asking for the prediction of spectroscopic signatures for well-known electronic states of iron porphyrins. The provided structures are distinct and chemically sound, and the specified spectroscopic methods are the correct tools for their differentiation. The premises are not contradictory, incomplete, or unrealistic. The problem requires substantive application of first principles and is not trivial.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Spectroscopic Signatures**\n\nWe must determine the expected spectroscopic signatures for each of the $3$ plausible structures based on fundamental principles.\n\n1.  **Case (i): Five-coordinate high-spin ferric center ($Fe^{3+}$, $S=5/2$)**\n    -   **Electronic Structure**: The iron is in the ferric ($+3$) oxidation state, which is a $d^5$ electronic configuration. The term \"high-spin\" implies that the ligand field splitting energy ($\\Delta$) is smaller than the spin-pairing energy ($P$), resulting in $5$ unpaired electrons and a total spin state of $S=5/2$. This is characteristic of coordination with weak-field ligands.\n    -   **UV–vis Spectroscopy**: Porphyrin complexes exhibit an intense Soret band (B band) and weaker Q bands. For a high-spin ferric porphyrin, the Soret band is typically found near $400\\ \\text{nm}$, and the Q bands in the $500\\text{–}650\\ \\text{nm}$ region are characteristically broad and ill-defined.\n    -   **EPR Spectroscopy**: According to Kramers' theorem, systems with a half-integer spin (like $S=5/2$) must be EPR active. For a high-spin $d^5$ system in an approximately axial ligand field, zero-field splitting separates the $m_s$ sublevels. At low temperatures (e.g., $<20\\ \\text{K}$), only the lowest-energy Kramers doublet ($m_s = \\pm 1/2$) is significantly populated. This doublet gives rise to a highly anisotropic EPR signal, classically observed with $g_{\\perp} \\approx 6$ and $g_{\\parallel} \\approx 2$. A strong signal at $g \\approx 6$ is the canonical signature of a high-spin ferric heme. A rhombic distortion can also produce a signal at $g \\approx 4.3$.\n\n2.  **Case (ii): Six-coordinate low-spin ferric center ($Fe^{3+}$, $S=1/2$)**\n    -   **Electronic Structure**: This is also a $d^5$ system. The term \"low-spin\" implies coordination to strong-field ligands, where $\\Delta > P$. This forces electron pairing, yielding a configuration of $(t_{2g})^5(e_g)^0$ with one unpaired electron and a total spin of $S=1/2$.\n    -   **UV–vis Spectroscopy**: The conversion from a high-spin to a low-spin ferric state upon binding a strong-field ligand (e.g., $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$) typically causes a red-shift of the Soret band to the $420\\text{–}430\\ \\text{nm}$ region, accompanied by the appearance of sharper, more distinct Q bands.\n    -   **EPR Spectroscopy**: As an $S=1/2$ system, it is a Kramers system and must be EPR active. The signal is characteristic of a low-spin $d^5$ ion and is highly anisotropic, typically showing $3$ distinct principal $g$-values ($g_x$, $g_y$, $g_z$) that are sensitive to the identity and geometry of the axial ligands. For instance, cyanide adducts often show signals with components such as $g \\approx 2.9$, $g \\approx 2.2$, and $g \\approx 1.5$.\n    -   **IR Spectroscopy**: If the strong-field ligand has a characteristic vibrational mode, it will be visible. For a cyanide ligand, an intense $\\nu(\\mathrm{C}\\equiv\\mathrm{N})$ stretch appears. In ferric complexes, this is typically found at frequencies greater than $2100\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$.\n\n3.  **Case (iii): Six-coordinate low-spin ferrous carbonyl adduct ($Fe^{2+}$-CO, $S=0$)**\n    -   **Electronic Structure**: The iron is in the ferrous ($+2$) oxidation state, which is a $d^6$ electronic configuration. Carbon monoxide ($\\mathrm{CO}$) is a strong $\\pi$-acceptor ligand that, together with the porphyrin macrocycle, enforces a large ligand field splitting, resulting in a low-spin state. All $6$ $d$-electrons are paired in the $t_{2g}$ orbitals, yielding a total spin of $S=0$.\n    -   **EPR Spectroscopy**: A system with $S=0$ has no unpaired electrons. It is diamagnetic and therefore **EPR silent**. This serves as a definitive diagnostic test.\n    -   **IR Spectroscopy**: The bound $\\mathrm{CO}$ ligand exhibits a strong, sharp stretching vibration, $\\nu(\\mathrm{C}\\equiv\\mathrm{O})$, typically in the $1900\\text{–}2000\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ range for heme complexes. The exact frequency is modulated by $\\pi$-backbonding from the iron $d$-orbitals into the $\\mathrm{CO}$ $\\pi^*$ antibonding orbitals. Furthermore, isotopic substitution provides confirmation. According to the harmonic oscillator model, the vibrational frequency $\\nu$ is related to the reduced mass $\\mu$ by $\\nu \\propto 1/\\sqrt{\\mu}$. Substituting $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ with the heavier $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ isotope increases the reduced mass of the $\\mathrm{Fe-CO}$ unit. Consequently, the $\\nu(\\mathrm{C}\\equiv\\mathrm{O})$ frequency must decrease (a downshift). The magnitude of this shift is predictable:\n    $$ \\frac{\\nu({}^{13}\\mathrm{CO})}{\\nu({}^{12}\\mathrm{CO})} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu({}^{12}\\mathrm{CO})}{\\mu({}^{13}\\mathrm{CO})}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{6.86\\ \\text{amu}}{7.17\\ \\text{amu}}} \\approx 0.978 $$\n    For a typical $\\nu({}^{12}\\mathrm{CO})$ of $1950\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$, the expected downshift is approximately $1950 \\times (1-0.978) \\approx 43\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Record a baseline UV–vis spectrum of Fe–Por at room temperature, then an X-band EPR spectrum at approximately $10\\ \\text{K}$. Next, titrate cyanide ($\\mathrm{CN}^-$) and, in a separate experiment, reduce under carbon monoxide ($\\mathrm{CO}$) with sodium dithionite, and acquire UV–vis, EPR, and IR (including ${}^{13}\\mathrm{CO}$). Expect initially a Soret band near $400\\ \\text{nm}$ with broadened, weak Q-bands and an EPR signal dominated by $g \\approx 6$ (with possible rhombic component near $g \\approx 4.3$), consistent with a five-coordinate high-spin ferric center. Upon $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$ binding, expect a red-shifted Soret to approximately $420$–$430\\ \\text{nm}$ with sharpened Q-bands and an EPR spectrum characteristic of low-spin ferric ($S=1/2$) with three principal components at approximately $g \\approx 2.9$, $g \\approx 2.2$, and $g \\approx 1.5$; IR should show $\\nu(\\mathrm{C}\\equiv\\mathrm{N})$ near $2120$–$2130\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$. Under reducing conditions with $\\mathrm{CO}$, expect EPR silence (low-spin ferrous, $S=0$) and an intense IR $\\nu(\\mathrm{C}\\equiv\\mathrm{O})$ band near $1945$–$1965\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ that downshifts by approximately $40$–$45\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ upon ${}^{13}\\mathrm{CO}$ substitution, consistent with the harmonic oscillator prediction that increased reduced mass lowers the vibrational frequency.**\n-   This option outlines a logical experimental sequence. The predicted signatures for the initial state match those derived for Case (i) (high-spin ferric). The predicted signatures upon reaction with $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$ correctly correspond to Case (ii) (low-spin ferric). The predicted signatures upon reduction and binding of $\\mathrm{CO}$ correctly correspond to Case (iii) (low-spin ferrous-carbonyl). The UV-vis shifts, EPR signals, IR frequencies, and crucially, the direction and magnitude of the IR isotopic shift are all physically and chemically correct. This experimental design would successfully distinguish among the three possibilities.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Record UV–vis, then add $\\mathrm{CN}^-$ and expect a blue-shift of the Soret from $420\\ \\text{nm}$ to approximately $380\\ \\text{nm}$ upon conversion to low-spin ferric; EPR should show an intense axial signal at $g \\approx 6$ for the low-spin state. In IR, expect $\\nu(\\mathrm{C}\\equiv\\mathrm{N})$ near $1900\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$, which upshifts by approximately $+20\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ upon ${}^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ substitution due to the stiffer bond. Under $\\mathrm{CO}$, the complex should remain EPR active at $g \\approx 2.0$.**\n-   This option contains numerous fundamental errors.\n    1. The HS $\\to$ LS ferric conversion typically causes a red-shift, not a blue-shift, of the Soret band.\n    2. An EPR signal at $g \\approx 6$ is a signature of a high-spin ($S=5/2$) state, not a low-spin ($S=1/2$) state.\n    3. The $\\nu(\\mathrm{C}\\equiv\\mathrm{N})$ stretch is found above $2100\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$, not near $1900\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ (which is characteristic of carbonyls).\n    4. Substitution with a heavier isotope (${}^{13}\\mathrm{C}$) increases reduced mass and must cause a *downshift* (lower frequency), not an upshift.\n    5. A ferrous-carbonyl adduct is diamagnetic ($S=0$) and EPR silent, not active at $g \\approx 2.0$.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Establish the presence of a thiolate trans ligand by forming a ferrous–$\\mathrm{CO}$ adduct and comparing IR $\\nu(\\mathrm{C}\\equiv\\mathrm{O})$ to a histidine-bound reference: stronger $\\pi$ backbonding from an anionic thiolate should increase $\\nu(\\mathrm{C}\\equiv\\mathrm{O})$ by approximately $+30\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ relative to histidine. The ${}^{13}\\mathrm{CO}$ band should upshift by approximately $+45\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ because ${}^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ increases the force constant. EPR at $10\\ \\text{K}$ on the ferric precursor is expected to be silent for high-spin ferric centers because of rapid relaxation.**\n-   This option also contains fundamental errors.\n    1. A stronger $\\pi$-donor ligand (like thiolate) increases back-donation into the $\\mathrm{CO}$ $\\pi^*$ orbital, which *weakens* the $\\mathrm{C}\\equiv\\mathrm{O}$ bond and *lowers* its stretching frequency, contrary to the claim.\n    2. Isotopic substitution does not change the force constant; it increases the mass, which causes a *downshift*, not an upshift.\n    3. High-spin ferric ($S=5/2$) is a Kramers system and is reliably observed by EPR at low temperatures; it is not silent. Fast relaxation is precisely why low temperatures are used to observe the signal.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Differentiate ferric versus ferrous by $\\mathrm{NO}$ binding and EPR: low-spin ferrous–$\\mathrm{NO}$ will show a strong EPR at $g \\approx 2.00$, while low-spin ferric–$\\mathrm{NO}$ will be EPR silent at $10\\ \\text{K}$. In the IR, assign nitrosyl by a band near $2100\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ that shifts up by approximately $+30\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ with ${}^{15}\\mathrm{NO}$. In UV–vis, expect that moving from high-spin to low-spin ferric causes a large blue-shift of the Soret by approximately $40\\ \\text{nm}$ due to increased ligand field splitting.**\n-   This option contains multiple errors.\n    1. While the EPR behavior of nitrosyl adducts is described correctly, the IR spectroscopy is not. The $\\nu(\\mathrm{N}\\equiv\\mathrm{O})$ frequency for heme-nitrosyls is not typically near $2100\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$. More importantly, substitution with a heavier isotope (${}^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ for $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$) must cause a *downshift* in frequency, not an upshift.\n    2. As stated previously, the conversion from high-spin to low-spin ferric typically causes a *red-shift* of the Soret band, not a blue-shift.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2570125"}]}
