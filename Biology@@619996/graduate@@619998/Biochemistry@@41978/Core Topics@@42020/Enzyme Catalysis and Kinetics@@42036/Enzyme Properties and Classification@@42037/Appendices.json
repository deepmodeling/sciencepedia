The reaction is $E + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\stackrel{k_2}{\\rightarrow} E + P$. The problem statement uses $k_{\\text{cat}}$ for the catalytic rate constant, which for this simple mechanism is equivalent to $k_2$.\n\nThe rate of change of the enzyme-substrate complex concentration, $[ES]$, is the rate of its formation minus the rates of its breakdown:\n$$\n\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_{1}[E][S] - k_{-1}[ES] - k_{2}[ES] = k_{1}[E][S] - (k_{-1} + k_{2})[ES]\n$$\nThe quasi-steady-state assumption (QSSA) states that after a short initial transient, the concentration of the intermediate complex $[ES]$ remains approximately constant, so $\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} \\approx 0$. Applying this gives:\n$$\nk_{1}[E][S] \\approx (k_{-1} + k_{2})[ES]\n$$\nThe total enzyme concentration $[E]_{\\text{total}}$ is conserved, so it is the sum of the free enzyme $[E]$ and the enzyme in the complex $[ES]$:\n$$\n[E]_{\\text{total}} = [E] + [ES]\n$$\nThis allows us to express the free enzyme concentration as $[E] = [E]_{\\text{total}} - [ES]$. Substituting this into the steady-state equation gives:\n$$\nk_{1}([E]_{\\text{total}} - [ES])[S] = (k_{-1} + k_{2})[ES]\n$$\nWe now solve for $[ES]$. Expanding the left side:\n$$\nk_{1}[E]_{\\text{total}}[S] - k_{1}[ES][S] = (k_{-1} + k_{2})[ES]\n$$\nRearranging to group terms containing $[ES]$:\n$$\nk_{1}[E]_{\\text{total}}[S] = (k_{-1} + k_{2})[ES] + k_{1}[S][ES] = ((k_{-1} + k_{2}) + k_{1}[S])[ES]\n$$\nThis yields an expression for the steady-state concentration of the complex:\n$$\n[ES] = \\frac{k_{1}[E]_{\\text{total}}[S]}{(k_{-1} + k_{2}) + k_{1}[S]}\n$$\nThe problem requires using the definition of the Michaelis constant, $K_{\\mathrm{M}}$, which is defined as:\n$$\nK_{\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{2}}{k_{1}}\n$$\nTo introduce $K_{\\mathrm{M}}$ into our expression for $[ES]$, we divide the numerator and denominator by $k_{1}$:\n$$\n[ES] = \\frac{[E]_{\\text{total}}[S]}{\\frac{k_{-1} + k_{2}}{k_{1}} + [S]} = \\frac{[E]_{\\text{total}}[S]}{K_{\\mathrm{M}} + [S]}\n$$\nThe initial velocity of the reaction, $v_{0}$, is the rate of formation of product $[P]$. Under initial-rate conditions, the reverse reaction involving the product is negligible. The velocity is determined by the catalytic step:\n$$\nv_{0} = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{2}[ES]\n$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $[ES]$ and identifying the catalytic rate constant $k_2$ with $k_{\\text{cat}}$ as specified, we arrive at the final expression for the initial velocity:\n$$\nv_{0} = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_{\\text{total}}[S]}{K_{\\mathrm{M}} + [S]}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNext, we evaluate $v_{0}$ for the given parameters. First, we must ensure consistent units.

Rounded to $4$ significant figures, $v_{0} = 0.09091\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nCase 2: $[S] = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n$$\nv_{0} = \\frac{(50\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(0.020\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})(50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})}{5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} + 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{50}{55}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = \\frac{10}{11}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nNumerically, this is approximately $0.909090... \\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Rounded to $4$ significant figures, $v_{0} = 0.9091\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nFinally, the interpretation of these results is demanded. The derived relationship $v_{0} = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_{\\text{total}}[S]}{K_{\\mathrm{M}} + [S]}$ shows how the reaction velocity depends on the substrate concentration relative to the Michaelis constant $K_{\\mathrm{M}}$.\nIn the first case, $[S] = 0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, which is one-tenth of $K_{\\mathrm{M}}$ ($5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$). Since $[S] \\ll K_{\\mathrm{M}}$, the denominator $K_{\\mathrm{M}} + [S] \\approx K_{\\mathrm{M}}$. The velocity equation simplifies to $v_{0} \\approx \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_{\\mathrm{M}}}[E]_{\\text{total}}[S]$, indicating that the velocity is approximately first-order with respect to $[S]$. The enzyme is largely unsaturated, and the rate is limited by how frequently enzyme and substrate molecules encounter each other. The calculated velocity of $0.09091\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is approximately $9.1\\%$ of the maximum possible velocity, $V_{\\max} = k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_{\\text{total}} = (50\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(0.020\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) = 1.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nIn the second case, $[S] = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, which is ten times $K_{\\mathrm{M}}$. Since $[S] \\gg K_{\\mathrm{M}}$, the denominator $K_{\\mathrm{M}} + [S] \\approx [S]$. The velocity equation simplifies to $v_{0} \\approx \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_{\\text{total}}[S]}{[S]} = k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_{\\text{total}} = V_{\\max}$. The reaction is approaching zero-order kinetics with respect to $[S]$. The enzyme is nearly saturated with substrate, and the overall rate is limited by the intrinsic catalytic speed of the enzyme ($k_{\\text{cat}}$), not by substrate availability. The calculated velocity of $0.9091\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is approximately $90.9\\%$ of $V_{\\max}$, consistent with the enzyme operating near its maximum capacity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.09091 & 0.9091 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2560698"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical models come to life through experimental measurement.

Let $V_{\\max} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}[E]_{\\mathrm{T}}$.\n$$v_{\\mathrm{i}} = \\frac{V_{\\max}[S]}{[S] + K_{\\mathrm{M}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{\\mathrm{i}}} \\right)}$$\nThis is the general rate equation for competitive inhibition.\n\nThe uninhibited rate, $v_{0}$, is found by setting $[I]=0$:\n$$v_{0} = \\frac{V_{\\max}[S]}{[S] + K_{\\mathrm{M}}}$$\n\nThe definition of $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ is the inhibitor concentration where the rate is halved: $v_{\\mathrm{i}}([I]=\\mathrm{IC}_{50}) = \\frac{1}{2} v_{0}$.\n$$\\frac{V_{\\max}[S]}{[S] + K_{\\mathrm{M}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}{K_{\\mathrm{i}}} \\right)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{V_{\\max}[S]}{[S] + K_{\\mathrm{M}}} \\right)$$\nThe term $V_{\\max}[S]$ cancels from both sides:\n$$\\frac{1}{[S] + K_{\\mathrm{M}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}{K_{\\mathrm{i}}} \\right)} = \\frac{1}{2([S] + K_{\\mathrm{M}})}$$\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides yields:\n$$[S] + K_{\\mathrm{M}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}{K_{\\mathrm{i}}} \\right) = 2([S] + K_{\\mathrm{M}})$$\n$$[S] + K_{\\mathrm{M}} + K_{\\mathrm{M}}\\frac{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}{K_{\\mathrm{i}}} = 2[S] + 2K_{\\mathrm{M}}$$\nIsolate the term containing $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$:\n$$K_{\\mathrm{M}}\\frac{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}{K_{\\mathrm{i}}} = (2[S] - [S]) + (2K_{\\mathrm{M}} - K_{\\mathrm{M}})$$\n$$K_{\\mathrm{M}}\\frac{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}{K_{\\mathrm{i}}} = [S] + K_{\\mathrm{M}}$$\nSolve for $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$:\n$$\\mathrm{IC}_{50} = K_{\\mathrm{i}} \\left( \\frac{[S] + K_{\\mathrm{M}}}{K_{\\mathrm{M}}} \\right) = K_{\\mathrm{i}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_{\\mathrm{M}}} \\right)$$\nThis is the general Cheng-Prusoff equation for competitive inhibition, derived from first principles as required.\n\nNow, we specialize this result to the given experimental condition, $[S] = 2K_{\\mathrm{M}}$:\n$$\\mathrm{IC}_{50} = K_{\\mathrm{i}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{2K_{\\mathrm{M}}}{K_{\\mathrm{M}}} \\right)$$\n$$\\mathrm{IC}_{50} = K_{\\mathrm{i}} (1 + 2)$$\n$$\\mathrm{IC}_{50} = 3K_{\\mathrm{i}}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the dimensionless conversion factor $\\frac{K_{\\mathrm{i}}}{\\mathrm{IC}_{50}}$.
