The \"constant-field framework\" is a well-defined physical model leading to the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equations. The provided concentrations, temperature, and physical constants are realistic and standard for physiological contexts. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary information provided to derive the current-voltage ($I-V$) relationship. The question is objective and asks for a qualitative and quantitative analysis of this relationship, which is a well-posed scientific problem. The problem is free of scientific absurdities, internal contradictions, and ambiguities.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived based on the provided information.\n\n### Derivation of the Current-Voltage Relation\n\nThe problem requires an analysis based on the constant-field assumption. This assumption, applied to the Nernst-Planck equation for electrodiffusion, yields the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) current equation. For a membrane permeable to a single monovalent cation, in this case $\\mathrm{K}^+$ with charge $z=+1$, the GHK current equation is:\n$$I(V) = P_{\\mathrm{K}}' \\frac{F^2 V}{RT} \\frac{[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{in}} - [\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{out}} e^{-FV/RT}}{1 - e^{-FV/RT}}$$\nwhere $P_{\\mathrm{K}}'$ is an effective permeability parameter that incorporates the true permeability $P_{\\mathrm{K}}$, membrane area, and other factors, but is constant with respect to voltage and concentration. The variables $R$, $T$, and $F$ are the gas constant, absolute temperature, and Faraday constant, respectively. $V$ is the transmembrane potential, and $[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{in}}$ and $[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{out}}$ are the intracellular and extracellular potassium concentrations. The sign convention of this equation is consistent with the problem statement, where $I>0$ represents a net outward a flow of positive charge.\n\nWe will now analyze the properties of this $I(V)$ function.\n\n1.  **Reversal Potential ($V_{rev}$)**\n    The reversal potential is the voltage at which the net current is zero, i.e., $I(V_{rev}) = 0$. This occurs when the numerator of the GHK equation is zero (for $V \\neq 0$):\n    $$[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{in}} - [\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{out}} e^{-FV_{rev}/RT} = 0$$\n    $$e^{-FV_{rev}/RT} = \\frac{[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{in}}}{[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{out}}}$$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $$-\\frac{FV_{rev}}{RT} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{in}}}{[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{out}}}\\right)$$\n    $$V_{rev} = -\\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{in}}}{[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{out}}}\\right) = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{out}}}{[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{in}}}\\right)$$\n    This is the Nernst potential for potassium, $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$. Let's calculate its value. The thermal voltage is:\n    $$\\frac{RT}{F} = \\frac{(8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})(310\\,\\mathrm{K})}{96485\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}} \\approx 0.0267\\,\\mathrm{V} = 26.7\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n    The concentration ratio is $[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{out}}/[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{in}} = 5/140 = 1/28$.\n    $$V_{rev} = (26.7\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{28}\\right) = -(26.7\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\ln(28)$$\n    Since $\\ln(28) \\approx 3.332$:\n    $$V_{rev} \\approx -(26.7\\,\\mathrm{mV})(3.332) \\approx -88.98\\,\\mathrm{mV} \\approx -89\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n    The current reverses at approximately $-89\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\n2.  **Asymptotic Behavior and Rectification**\n    The $I(V)$ relation is clearly nonlinear due to the exponential terms. This nonlinearity is called rectification. We examine the asymptotic behavior for large positive and negative voltages to characterize the rectification.\n\n    -   **For large positive $V$ ($V \\to +\\infty$):**\n        The term $e^{-FV/RT}$ approaches $0$. The GHK equation simplifies to:\n        $$I(V) \\approx P_{\\mathrm{K}}' \\frac{F^2 V}{RT} \\frac{[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{in}} - 0}{1 - 0} = \\left(P_{\\mathrm{K}}' \\frac{F^2}{RT} [\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{in}}\\right) V$$\n        In this limit, the current $I(V)$ becomes a linear function of $V$. The slope, which represents the conductance $G$, is proportional to the intracellular concentration, $[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{in}}$.\n\n    -   **For large negative $V$ ($V \\to -\\infty$):**\n        The term $e^{-FV/RT}$ approaches $+\\infty$. To resolve the indeterminate form, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $e^{FV/RT}$:\n        $$I(V) = P_{\\mathrm{K}}' \\frac{F^2 V}{RT} \\frac{[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{in}}e^{FV/RT} - [\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{out}}}{e^{FV/RT} - 1}$$\n        As $V \\to -\\infty$, the term $e^{FV/RT}$ approaches $0$. The equation simplifies to:\n        $$I(V) \\approx P_{\\mathrm{K}}' \\frac{F^2 V}{RT} \\frac{0 - [\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{out}}}{0 - 1} = \\left(P_{\\mathrm{K}}' \\frac{F^2}{RT} [\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{out}}\\right) V$$\n        In this limit, the current $I(V)$ also becomes a linear function of $V$. The slope (conductance) is proportional to the extracellular concentration, $[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{out}}$.\n\n3.  **Ratio of Asymptotic Slopes**\n    The ratio of the conductance at large positive voltage ($G_{V \\to +\\infty}$) to the conductance at large negative voltage ($G_{V \\to -\\infty}$) is:\n    $$\\frac{G_{V \\to +\\infty}}{G_{V \\to -\\infty}} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{K}}' \\frac{F^2}{RT} [\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{in}}}{P_{\\mathrm{K}}' \\frac{F^2}{RT} [\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{out}}} = \\frac{[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{in}}}{[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{out}}}$$\n    Using the given concentrations:\n    $$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{140\\,\\mathrm{mM}}{5\\,\\mathrm{mM}} = 28$$\n    Since the conductance for positive (outward) voltages is $28$ times greater than for negative (inward) voltages, the channel exhibits **outward rectification**. This occurs because the current is carried by $\\mathrm{K}^+$ ions. The driving concentration for outward current is the high $[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{in}}$, while the driving concentration for inward current is the low $[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{out}}$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A) $I(V)$ is nonlinear, reverses near $V \\approx -89\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, and exhibits outward rectification: for large positive $V$, $I$ increases approximately linearly with a slope proportional to $[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{in}}$, whereas for large negative $V$, the magnitude of $I$ increases approximately linearly with a much smaller slope proportional to $[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{out}}$; the ratio of these extreme slopes is about $28$.**\n-   $I(V)$ is nonlinear: **Correct**.

The calculated ratio is exactly $28$.\nThis option accurately describes all features derived from the GHK model.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B) $I(V)$ is linear (Ohmic) with reversal at $V = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, because a constant permeability implies no rectification.**\n-   $I(V)$ is linear (Ohmic): **Incorrect**. The GHK equation is nonlinear. The premise \"constant permeability implies no rectification\" is false; rectification in the GHK model arises from the asymmetric ion concentrations across the membrane.\n-   Reversal at $V=0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$: **Incorrect**. Reversal occurs at $E_{\\mathrm{K}} \\approx -89\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Reversal at $0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ would only occur if $[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{in}} = [\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{out}}$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C) $I(V)$ is nonlinear, reverses near $V \\approx +89\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, and exhibits inward rectification: the magnitude of $I$ is larger at negative $V$ than at positive $V$, with the extreme slope ratio of about $28$ favoring negative $V$.**\n-   Reverses near $V \\approx +89\\,\\mathrm{mV}$: **Incorrect**. The reversal potential $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ is negative because $[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{out}} < [\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{in}}$. A value of $+89\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ would imply $[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{in}} < [\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{out}}$.\n-   Exhibits inward rectification: **Incorrect**. The system shows outward rectification because the larger concentration is inside, facilitating outward current flow. Inward rectification would occur if $[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{out}} > [\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{in}}$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D) $I(V)$ is symmetric about the reversal potential (identical magnitudes for equal depolarizations and hyperpolarizations relative to reversal), and the extreme-voltage slopes on both sides approach the same limit proportional to $([\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{in}} + [\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{out}})/2$.**\n-   Symmetric about the reversal potential: **Incorrect**. The fact that the channel rectifies means the $I(V)$ curve is asymmetric.\n-   Extreme-voltage slopes approach the same limit: **Incorrect**. We proved that the asymptotic slopes are different and their ratio is $28$.\n-   Slopes proportional to the average concentration: **Incorrect**. The slopes are proportional to the concentration on the side *from which* the ion flux originates in that voltage regime.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2549517"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theory to practice, electrophysiologists analyze experimental data to characterize channel properties.

By the definition of $K_d$ in the context of the Hill equation, the concentration at which the fractional block is $\\frac{1}{2}$ is equal to $K_d$.\n$$B(D=K_d) = \\frac{K_d^{n_H}}{K_d^{n_H} + K_d^{n_H}} = \\frac{K_d^{n_H}}{2K_d^{n_H}} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nTherefore, from the given data, we can directly conclude:\n$$K_d = 50\\ \\text{nM}$$\n\nTo find the Hill coefficient $n_H$, we can use any other data point. Let us use $(D, B) = (200\\ \\text{nM}, \\frac{8}{9})$. Substituting these values and $K_d=50\\ \\text{nM}$ into the Hill equation:\n$$\\frac{8}{9} = \\frac{200^{n_H}}{50^{n_H} + 200^{n_H}}$$\nWe can simplify the expression by dividing the numerator and the denominator on the right side by $50^{n_H}$:\n$$\\frac{8}{9} = \\frac{(200/50)^{n_H}}{(50/50)^{n_H} + (200/50)^{n_H}} = \\frac{4^{n_H}}{1 + 4^{n_H}}$$\nNow, we solve for $n_H$.\n$$8(1 + 4^{n_H}) = 9 \\cdot 4^{n_H}$$\n$$8 + 8 \\cdot 4^{n_H} = 9 \\cdot 4^{n_H}$$\n$$8 = (9 - 8) \\cdot 4^{n_H}$$\n$$8 = 4^{n_H}$$\nTo solve for the exponent $n_H$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln(8) = \\ln(4^{n_H})$$\n$$\\ln(2^3) = n_H \\ln(2^2)$$\n$$3\\ln(2) = n_H \\cdot 2\\ln(2)$$\n$$n_H = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5$$\nThe data are perfectly described by a Hill isotherm with $K_d=50\\ \\text{nM}$ and $n_H=1.5$. Per the problem requirements, we round these values to four significant figures, yielding $K_d = 50.00$ and $n_H = 1.500$.\n\nPart 2: Evaluation of the alternative multi-site model.\nThe alternative hypothesis states that there are $m$ identical and independent binding sites. Blockade occurs only when all $m$ sites are simultaneously occupied. For a single site, the binding is non-cooperative, so its fractional occupancy $\\theta$ follows the simple Langmuir isotherm (Hill equation with $n_H=1$):\n$$\\theta = \\frac{D}{k_d + D}$$\nwhere $k_d$ is the microscopic dissociation constant for a single site. Since the sites are independent, the probability of all $m$ sites being occupied is $\\theta^m$. The fractional block $B$ is then:\n$$B(D) = \\theta^m = \\left(\\frac{D}{k_d + D}\\right)^m$$\nThe problem asks if this model can be consistent with the \"steepness at half-block\" observed in the data. A standard measure for steepness at half-block is the local Hill slope, defined as the derivative of the Hill plot transform with respect to the logarithm of the concentration, evaluated at the midpoint.\n$$n_{local} = \\frac{d}{d \\ln(D)} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{B}{1-B}\\right) \\right]$$\nFor the Hill model, evaluating this at the midpoint $D=K_d$ gives exactly the Hill coefficient, $n_{local} = n_H$. For our data, this steepness value is $1.5$.\n\nNow, we must compute the steepness for the $m$-site model at its own half-block point, $D_{1/2}$. First, we must find $D_{1/2}$ for this model by setting $B(D_{1/2}) = 1/2$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{D_{1/2}}{k_d + D_{1/2}}\\right)^m = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies \\frac{D_{1/2}}{k_d + D_{1/2}} = 2^{-1/m}$$\nNow we calculate $n_{local, m}$ for this model.\n$$n_{local, m} = \\frac{d}{d \\ln(D)} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta^m}{1-\\theta^m}\\right) \\right]$$\nUsing the chain rule, $n_{local, m} = D \\frac{B'(D)}{B(D)(1-B(D))}$. At the half-block point $D=D_{1/2}$, this simplifies to $n_{local, m}(D_{1/2}) = 4 D_{1/2} B'(D_{1/2})$.\nThe derivative $B'(D)$ is:\n$$B'(D) = \\frac{d}{dD} \\left(\\frac{D}{k_d+D}\\right)^m = m \\left(\\frac{D}{k_d+D}\\right)^{m-1} \\left(\\frac{k_d}{(k_d+D)^2}\\right) = \\frac{m k_d D^{m-1}}{(k_d+D)^{m+1}}$$\nEvaluating at $D=D_{1/2}$:\n$$n_{local, m}(D_{1/2}) = 4 D_{1/2} \\frac{m k_d D_{1/2}^{m-1}}{(k_d+D_{1/2})^{m+1}} = \\frac{4 m k_d D_{1/2}^m}{(k_d+D_{1/2})^{m+1}}$$\nWe can simplify this by using $\\frac{D_{1/2}}{k_d+D_{1/2}} = 2^{-1/m}$:\n$$n_{local, m} = 4 m \\left(\\frac{k_d}{k_d+D_{1/2}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{D_{1/2}}{k_d+D_{1/2}}\\right)^m$$\nFrom $\\frac{D_{1/2}}{k_d+D_{1/2}} = 2^{-1/m}$, we have $k_d+D_{1/2} = D_{1/2} 2^{1/m}$, which implies $k_d = D_{1/2}(2^{1/m}-1)$. Substituting $k_d$:\n$$\\frac{k_d}{k_d+D_{1/2}} = \\frac{D_{1/2}(2^{1/m}-1)}{D_{1/2} 2^{1/m}} = 1 - 2^{-1/m}$$\nSubstituting back into the expression for $n_{local, m}$:\n$$n_{local, m} = 4 m (1 - 2^{-1/m}) \\left(2^{-1/m}\\right)^m = 4 m (1 - 2^{-1/m}) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 2m(1-2^{-1/m})$$\nTo be consistent with the observed data, this steepness must equal $n_H = 1.5$:\n$$1.5 = 2m(1-2^{-1/m})$$\n$$0.75 = m(1-2^{-1/m})$$\nWe need to determine if there is an integer solution $m \\ge 1$ for this equation. Let $g(m) = m(1-2^{-1/m})$. We analyze the behavior of this function for $m \\ge 1$.\nFor $m=1$, $g(1) = 1(1-2^{-1}) = 0.5$.\nThe function $g(m)$ is monotonically increasing for $m>0$. To find its maximum possible value, we take the limit as $m \\to \\infty$. Let $x=1/m$, so $x \\to 0^+$:\n$$\\lim_{m\\to\\infty} g(m) = \\lim_{x\\to 0^+} \\frac{1-2^{-x}}{x}$$\nThis is the definition of the derivative of the function $f(x) = 1-2^{-x}$ at $x=0$.\n$f'(x) = - (2^{-x} \\ln(2) \\cdot (-1)) = 2^{-x} \\ln(2)$.\nAt $x=0$, $f'(0) = 2^0 \\ln(2) = \\ln(2)$.\nThus, the maximum value of $g(m)$ is $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.6931$.\nWe are seeking a solution to $g(m)=0.75$. Since the maximum value of the function $g(m)$ for $m \\ge 1$ is $\\ln(2)$, and $0.75 > \\ln(2)$, there is no real number $m \\ge 1$ that can satisfy the equation. Consequently, there is no integer solution for $m \\ge 1$.\nAccording to the problem's instructions, if no such integer exists, we must report $m=0$.\n\nThe final results are $K_d = 50.00\\ \\text{nM}$, $n_H = 1.500$, and $m=0$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 50.00 & 1.500 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2549539"}]}
