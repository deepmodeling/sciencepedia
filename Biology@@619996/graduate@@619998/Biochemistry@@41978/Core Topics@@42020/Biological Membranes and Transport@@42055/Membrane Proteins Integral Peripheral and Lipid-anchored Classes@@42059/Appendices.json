Hydropathy analysis reveals a single hydrophobic segment of approximately $22$ residues centered at residue $100$. The $15$ residues immediately N-terminal to this hydrophobic segment have a net charge of $+3$ (Lys/Arg), while the $15$ residues immediately C-terminal have a net charge of $0$. In mammalian cells, Protein X expresses as an integral membrane protein with an N-terminal cytosolic domain and a C-terminal luminal domain. You wish to invert its topology so that the N-terminus becomes luminal and the C-terminus becomes cytosolic by rational mutagenesis of the transmembrane segment flanks. You also plan to use glycosylation reporters to confirm the reorientation of luminal exposure.\n\nUse the following fundamental base:\n- The positive-inside rule: enrichment of basic residues (Lys/Arg) on one side of a transmembrane helix biases that side to remain cytosolic during insertion.\n- N-linked glycosylation by the ER oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) occurs only in the ER lumen at Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequons, where X is any residue except Proline; addition of an N-linked glycan causes an electrophoretic mobility shift on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).\n- High-mannose ER N-glycans are sensitive to Endoglycosidase H (Endo H); N-linked glycosylation can be blocked with tunicamycin; Peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) removes N-linked glycans after cell lysis; luminal domains are protected from exogenous protease in intact sealed microsomes but are digested after detergent permeabilization.\n- Integral membrane proteins resist alkaline sodium carbonate extraction (pH $11$), whereas peripheral membrane proteins are released.\n\nWhich experimental design most directly tests the positive-inside rule by inverting Protein X topology through flanking charge swaps and includes appropriate controls to verify the reoriented glycosylation sites?\n\nA. Mutate all basic residues on the N-terminal flank of the transmembrane helix to acidic residues to eliminate the net positive charge, and add an equal number of Lys/Arg residues to the C-terminal flank at positions at least $5$ residues away from the hydrophobic core to avoid disrupting helix insertion; keep the hydrophobic core length and composition unchanged. Engineer one canonical Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequon $10$ residues N-terminal to the hydrophobic segment and another $10$ residues C-terminal to it. Express wild type and mutant constructs in cells and in vitro translation with rough microsomes. Assess glycosylation by SDS-PAGE mobility shifts with the following controls: wild type versus mutant; tunicamycin treatment; Endo H and PNGase F digestion post-lysis; sequon-null controls (Asn to Gln) for each site; and protease protection in sealed microsomes with and without detergent to validate luminal exposure. Confirm integral membrane insertion by sodium carbonate extraction at pH $11$.\n\nB. Swap flanking charges as in A but also append an N-terminal cleavable signal peptide to increase ER targeting efficiency.

A robust experimental design must satisfy three criteria:\n1.  **Rational Mutagenesis:** The mutations must be designed to directly and specifically manipulate the variable under investigation—the flanking charges—in accordance with the positive-inside rule. To force the N-terminus into the lumen and the C-terminus into the cytosol, the net positive charge must be moved from the N-terminal flank to the C-terminal flank. Other parameters, such as the hydrophobicity and length of the transmembrane domain, must be held constant to isolate the effect of charge.\n2.  **Unambiguous Reporting:** The experimental readout must reliably distinguish between the two topologies. The provided principles establish N-linked glycosylation as an ideal reporter, as it occurs only in the ER lumen. A comprehensive strategy would place potential glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequons) on *both* sides of the transmembrane domain. For the wild type ($N_{cyto}/C_{lumen}$), only the C-terminal site should be glycosylated. For a successfully inverted mutant ($N_{lumen}/C_{cyto}$), only the N-terminal site should be glycosylated.\n3.  **Rigorous Controls:** The experiment must include a complete set of controls to validate every assumption and interpretation. This includes:\n    - Comparison of wild type versus mutant.\n    - Confirmation that any observed mobility shift is due to N-linked glycosylation (e.g., elimination of the shift by tunicamycin treatment or by digestion with Endo H/PNGase F).\n    - Confirmation that the glycosylation is sequon-dependent (e.g., by mutating Asn to Gln).\n    - Confirmation that the protein is indeed an integral membrane protein and not peripherally associated or mislocalized (e.g., resistance to alkaline carbonate extraction).\n    - An orthogonal confirmation of topology (e.g., a protease protection assay).\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A.** This option proposes to mutate basic residues on the N-terminal flank to acidic ones and add basic residues to the C-terminal flank. This is a direct and logical application of the positive-inside rule to invert topology. It correctly keeps the hydrophobic core unchanged to isolate the variable of interest. It engineers glycosylation sequons on both N- and C-terminal flanks, allowing for a definitive readout of topology for both the wild-type and mutant proteins. Critically, it includes a full and proper suite of controls: comparison of wild type and mutant, tunicamycin treatment, enzymatic deglycosylation with both Endo H and PNGase F, sequon-null mutants, a protease protection assay for orthogonal topology validation, and alkaline extraction to confirm integral membrane insertion. This design is comprehensive, rigorous, and directly addresses the question.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B.** This option's proposal to add an N-terminal cleavable signal peptide is a catastrophic flaw. The original protein is a signal-anchor type, where the transmembrane domain itself mediates ER targeting. Adding a cleavable signal peptide fundamentally changes the insertion mechanism to that of a Type I protein, forcing an $N_{lumen}$ orientation irrespective of the flanking charges of the downstream transmembrane segment. This design does not test the positive-inside rule for a signal-anchor protein. Furthermore, it proposes using only a single C-terminal glycosylation site, which is an incomplete reporter strategy, and explicitly rejects the use of necessary enzymatic and chemical controls to validate the glycosylation event. This is scientifically unacceptable.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C.** This option contains multiple fundamental errors. The mutagenesis strategy—creating high positive charge on *both* flanks—is not a rational way to achieve a clean topological inversion based on the positive-inside rule; it would likely result in frustrated insertion. Shortening the hydrophobic core to $12$ residues is another serious flaw; such a short segment is generally insufficient to span the membrane, leading to mis-insertion or mistargeting, and it introduces a confounding variable. The central premise of assessing \"cytosolic glycosylation\" at Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequons is factually wrong; this type of glycosylation is strictly luminal. Finally, the idea of treating living cells with PNGase F to access cytosolic proteins is impossible, as the enzyme cannot cross the plasma membrane.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D.** This option's validation method is flawed and insufficient. Using trypsin on \"intact cells\" is the incorrect assay for a protein located in the internal ER membrane; this assay probes the cell surface. Even if interpreted as a protease protection assay on microsomes, using only an N-terminal epitope is an incomplete strategy. The addition of a C-terminal palmitoylation motif introduces a confounding variable, making it impossible to attribute any change in topology solely to the flanking charges. Most egregiously, it suggests that confirming membrane association via alkaline extraction is sufficient to \"infer successful inversion.\" Alkaline extraction confirms integral membrane insertion but provides absolutely no information about the protein's orientation within the membrane. This represents a gross misinterpretation of the technique. The explicit omission of glycosylation reporters is a major weakness.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on this analysis, Option A is the only experimental design that is scientifically sound, rigorous, and appropriately controlled to test the hypothesis as stated.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2575850"}]}
