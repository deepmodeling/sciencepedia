For this binary system:\n$$ \\mu_A^{(\\alpha)} = \\mu_A^{(\\beta)} $$\n$$ \\mu_B^{(\\alpha)} = \\mu_B^{(\\beta)} $$\nThese thermodynamic constraints establish that for a given temperature and pressure, the compositions of the coexisting phases, $x_A^{(\\alpha)}$ and $x_A^{(\\beta)}$, are fixed quantities.\n\nThe lever rule itself is derived from the principle of mass conservation. The total number of moles of component $A$ in the system, $n_A$, is the sum of the moles of $A$ in each phase:\n$$ n_A = n_A^{(\\alpha)} + n_A^{(\\beta)} $$\nBy definition, the number of moles of a component is the product of its mole fraction and the total number of moles in that phase (or the overall system).
