In self-assembly, the hydrophobic effect disfavors exposure of hydrocarbon to water, while chain conformations cannot extend beyond a finite maximal contour length. Use geometric constraints implied by these facts to formulate the dimensionless packing parameter $p$ in terms of the hydrocarbon chain volume $v$, the equilibrium interfacial headgroup area $a_{0}$, and the maximal hydrocarbon chain length $l$.

It relies on the established biophysical model of the critical packing parameter, a geometric argument developed by Israelachvili and coworkers to predict the morphology of self-assembled amphiphilic structures. All provided parameters are physically realistic for a phosphatidylethanolamine molecule and dimensionally consistent. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the formulation and application of the dimensionless packing parameter, denoted as $p$. This parameter relates the geometry of an individual amphiphilic molecule to the geometry of the aggregate structure it is likely to form in an aqueous environment. The formulation arises from a simple geometric consideration of the space occupied by the hydrophobic tail of the molecule within the aggregate.\n\nLet $v$ be the volume of the hydrocarbon chains of the amphiphile.\nLet $a_{0}$ be the optimal or equilibrium area occupied by the polar headgroup at the hydrocarbon-water interface.\nLet $l$ be the maximal effective length of the hydrocarbon chains, which is constrained by their fully extended conformation (the contour length).\n\nThe packing parameter $p$ is defined as the ratio of the actual volume of the hydrophobic tails, $v$, to the volume of a hypothetical cylinder defined by the headgroup area $a_{0}$ as its base and the maximal chain length $l$ as its height. This hypothetical cylindrical volume, $V_{cyl}$, represents the volume the chains would occupy if they were able to pack perfectly straight without any constraints, filling a space defined by the headgroup.\n\nThe volume of this reference cylinder is given by:\n$$V_{cyl} = a_{0} \\cdot l$$\n\nThe packing parameter $p$ is thus formulated as:\n$$p = \\frac{v}{a_{0} l}$$\n\nThis dimensionless ratio effectively describes the average shape of the molecule within the aggregate.\n- If $p \\approx 1$, the molecule is approximately cylindrical. A collection of such molecules can pack efficiently into a planar bilayer with zero mean curvature.\n- If $p  1$, the molecule is cone-shaped (the volume $v$ is smaller than what a cylinder of height $l$ and base $a_{0}$ would allow). These molecules pack into structures with positive curvature, such as spherical or cylindrical micelles, where the headgroups form the outer surface.\n- If $p  1$, the molecule is an inverted or truncated cone shape (the volume $v$ is larger than that of the reference cylinder). To accommodate this shape and minimize the free energy of the system, the molecules must pack into structures with negative curvature, where the interface curves away from the aqueous phase. This leads to the formation of inverted phases.\n\nWe are given the following parameters for a phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) molecule:\n- Hydrocarbon chain volume, $v = 1.05\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{3}$\n- Equilibrium interfacial headgroup area, $a_{0} = 0.47\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{2}$\n- Maximal hydrocarbon chain length, $l = 1.60\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for the packing parameter:\n$$p = \\frac{1.05\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{3}}{(0.47\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{2})(1.60\\,\\mathrm{nm})}$$\nFirst, we calculate the denominator:\n$$a_{0} l = 0.47 \\times 1.60\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{3} = 0.752\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{3}$$\nNow, we compute the ratio:\n$$p = \\frac{1.05}{0.752} \\approx 1.39627659...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$p \\approx 1.40$$\n\nThe calculated value of the packing parameter is $p \\approx 1.40$. Since $p  1$, the PE molecule exhibits a pronounced inverted cone shape. The cross-sectional area of the hydrocarbon tails is significantly larger than the area of the polar headgroup. Packing such molecules into a planar bilayer ($p \\approx 1$) would create energetically unfavorable voids between the hydrocarbon chains or force the chains into highly constrained, low-entropy conformations. To achieve optimal packing and satisfy the hydrophobic effect by minimizing water-hydrocarbon contact, the aggregate must adopt a structure with negative curvature. The inverted hexagonal phase (HII) is such a structure. It consists of cylindrical aqueous channels enclosed by a monolayer of PE molecules, with their small headgroups facing the water and their bulky hydrocarbon tails radiating outwards into a continuous lipid phase. This geometry perfectly accommodates the inverted cone shape of molecules where $p  1$, explaining why phosphatidylethanolamine has a strong propensity to form the HII phase rather than planar bilayers under physiological conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.40}$$", "id": "2586670"}, {"introduction": "Beyond static structure, the properties of a lipid bilayer are profoundly influenced by temperature, most notably through the gel-to-fluid phase transition.

It is determined to be a valid problem for which a solution can be constructed.\n\nThe phase transition from the gel (ordered) phase to the fluid (disordered) phase occurs at the temperature $T_m$ at which the two phases are in thermodynamic equilibrium. This condition is defined by the Gibbs free energy difference between the fluid and gel phases being zero.\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{tr}}(T_m) = 0\n$$\nThe Gibbs free energy of transition, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{tr}}$, is related to the enthalpy of transition, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{tr}}$, and the entropy of transition, $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{tr}}$, by the fundamental thermodynamic equation:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{tr}}(T) = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{tr}} - T \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{tr}}\n$$\nAssuming that $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{tr}}$ and $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{tr}}$ are approximately constant with respect to temperature over the range of the transition, we can set $T = T_m$ and substitute the expression for $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{tr}}(T_m)$ into the equilibrium condition:\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{tr}} - T_m \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{tr}} = 0\n$$\nSolving this equation for $T_m$ yields the general expression for the transition temperature, also known as the van 't Hoff equation for a two-state transition:\n$$\nT_m = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{tr}}}{\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{tr}}}\n$$\nThe problem provides linear models for the dependence of $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{tr}}$ and $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{tr}}$ on the structural parameters $n$ and $u$:\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{tr}}(n,u) = \\Delta H_{0} + a n + b u\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{tr}}(n,u) = \\Delta S_{0} + c n + d u\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta H_{0}$ and $\\Delta S_{0}$ are the baseline contributions, and the coefficients $a, b, c, d$ represent the incremental changes per methylene group or per double bond.\n\nTo obtain the required closed-form expression for $T_m(n,u)$, we substitute these linear functions into the expression for $T_m$:\n$$\nT_m(n,u) = \\frac{\\Delta H_{0} + a n + b u}{\\Delta S_{0} + c n + d u}\n$$\nThis is the complete analytical expression for the transition temperature as a function of $n$ and $u$ based on the provided LFER model.\n\nThe second part of the task is to justify why $T_m$ typically increases with increasing chain length $n$ at a fixed level of unsaturation $u$. To do this, we must analyze how $T_m$ changes as $n$ increments by $1$. This corresponds to evaluating the sign of the change $\\Delta T_m = T_m(n+1, u) - T_m(n, u)$. An increase in $T_m$ means that $\\Delta T_m  0$, or $T_m(n+1, u)  T_m(n, u)$.\n\nFirst, let us establish the physical signs of the relevant coefficients, $a$ and $c$.\nThe coefficient $a$ is the change in transition enthalpy per added methylene group ($\\mathrm{CH}_2$). Adding a $\\mathrm{CH}_2$ group increases the length of the acyl chain, leading to stronger van der Waals interactions between adjacent chains in the ordered gel phase. This stabilizes the gel phase relative to the fluid phase. Consequently, more energy (enthalpy) is required to disrupt these interactions and drive the transition to the fluid state. Thus, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{tr}}$ increases with $n$, which implies $a  0$.\nThe coefficient $c$ is the change in transition entropy per added methylene group. Adding a $\\mathrm{CH}_2$ group increases the number of single bonds in the acyl chain, which increases the number of possible rotational conformations. The conformational freedom is severely restricted in the ordered gel phase but is significant in the disordered fluid phase. Therefore, the gain in entropy upon melting, $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{tr}} = S_{\\mathrm{fluid}} - S_{\\mathrm{gel}}$, increases with chain length. This implies $c  0$.\n\nNow, we examine the condition $T_m(n+1, u)  T_m(n, u)$. Let us define $H(n,u) = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{tr}}(n,u)$ and $S(n,u) = \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{tr}}(n,u)$. The inequality is:\n$$\n\\frac{H(n,u) + a}{S(n,u) + c}  \\frac{H(n,u)}{S(n,u)}\n$$\nSince the transition is endothermic ($\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{tr}}  0$) and involves an increase in disorder ($\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{tr}}  0$), both the numerator and the denominator on both sides of the inequality are positive quantities. We can therefore cross-multiply without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$\nS(n,u) \\left( H(n,u) + a \\right)  H(n,u) \\left( S(n,u) + c \\right)\n$$\nExpanding both sides gives:\n$$\nS(n,u) H(n,u) + a S(n,u)  H(n,u) S(n,u) + c H(n,u)\n$$\nSubtracting the common term $S(n,u) H(n,u)$ from both sides, we are left with:\n$$\na S(n,u)  c H(n,u)\n$$\nSince $S(n,u) = \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{tr}}(n,u)$ is positive, we can divide by it:\n$$\na  c \\frac{H(n,u)}{S(n,u)}\n$$\nRecognizing that the ratio on the right is simply the definition of the transition temperature, $T_m(n,u) = \\frac{H(n,u)}{S(n,u)}$, the condition for $T_m$ to increase with $n$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{a}{c}  T_m(n,u)\n$$\nThis inequality provides the physical justification. The term $a/c$ represents the ratio of the incremental enthalpy gain to the incremental entropy gain per methylene group. This ratio has units of temperature and can be interpreted as the limiting transition temperature for a hypothetical chain of infinite length ($T_{\\infty} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} T_m(n,u) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\Delta H_0 + an + bu}{\\Delta S_0 + cn + du} = \\frac{a}{c}$). For $T_m$ to increase with $n$, the value of $T_m(n,u)$ for any finite chain length $n$ must be less than this limiting value. Experimental data for homologous series of saturated lipids confirms that $T_m$ increases with $n$ but eventually plateaus, approaching an asymptotic limit. This shows that the condition $\\frac{a}{c}  T_m(n,u)$ is indeed physically met.\n\nIn summary, adding a methylene group increases the stability of the gel phase due to stronger van der Waals forces (an enthalpic effect, measured by $a$) and also increases the potential disorder of the fluid phase (an entropic effect, measured by $c$). The fact that $T_m$ increases demonstrates that the enthalpic stabilization of the gel phase is the dominant effect; a higher temperature is required to provide sufficient thermal energy for the entropy gain to overcome the larger enthalpy barrier to melting.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\Delta H_{0} + a n + b u}{\\Delta S_{0} + c n + d u}}\n$$", "id": "2586673"}, {"introduction": "A defining feature of the fluid-phase lipid bilayer is its dual nature as both an elastic sheet and a thermally fluctuating surface.

However, a fluid membrane exhibits thermal undulations, which store a certain amount of \"excess\" area.
