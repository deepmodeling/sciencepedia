It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The problem requires the derivation of the translational self-diffusion coefficient from fundamental principles and a subsequent numerical evaluation. We shall proceed.\n\nThe motion of a solute particle in a fluid, known as Brownian motion, is described by the Langevin equation. This equation models the particle's dynamics under the influence of two opposing forces: a systematic frictional drag force from the viscous medium and a random, fluctuating force from the thermal motion of the surrounding solvent molecules. For a particle of mass $m$ and velocity $\\vec{v}$, the Langevin equation is:\n$$m \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = \\vec{F}_{\\text{drag}}(t) + \\vec{F}_{\\text{random}}(t)$$\nThe system is an isothermal, Newtonian aqueous environment with no-slip boundary conditions. For a spherical solute of effective hydrodynamic radius $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, the drag force is given by Stokes' law:\n$$\\vec{F}_{\\text{drag}}(t) = -\\gamma \\vec{v}(t)$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the friction coefficient. For a sphere, Stokes' law provides the explicit form for this coefficient:\n$$\\gamma = 6 \\pi \\eta r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$$\nHere, $\\eta$ is the dynamic shear viscosity of the solvent. The random force $\\vec{F}_{\\text{random}}(t)$ arises from the incessant, chaotic collisions of solvent molecules with the solute. It has a time average of zero, $\\langle \\vec{F}_{\\text{random}}(t) \\rangle = 0$, but its magnitude is linked to the temperature of the system.\n\nThe core physical principle connecting the dissipative drag force to the stochastic thermal force is the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem. For a system in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$, this theorem states that the same microscopic interactions causing friction (dissipation) also drive the thermal fluctuations. A key consequence of this theorem is the Einstein relation, which connects the translational diffusion coefficient $D$ to the friction coefficient $\\gamma$ and the thermal energy scale $k_{B}T$, where $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant:\n$$D = \\frac{k_{B}T}{\\gamma}$$\nThis relation can be derived by considering a system of non-interacting particles in a gravitational or other external potential field. At equilibrium, the downward drift flux caused by the external force must be precisely balanced by the upward diffusion flux driven by the resulting concentration gradient. Equating these fluxes yields the Einstein relation.\n\nBy substituting the expression for the friction coefficient $\\gamma$ from Stokes' law into the Einstein relation, we arrive at the desired expression for the self-diffusion coefficient of a spherical particle. This is the Stokes-Einstein equation:\n$$D = \\frac{k_{B}T}{6 \\pi \\eta r_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$$\nThis equation expresses the diffusion coefficient $D$ in terms of the temperature $T$, solvent viscosity $\\eta$, the effective hydrodynamic radius $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, and the universal constants $k_{B}$ and $\\pi$, as requested by the problem.\n\nNow, we proceed to the numerical evaluation.

It describes a classic scenario of concentration polarization in a reverse osmosis system, a fundamental topic in transport phenomena and membrane science. All provided parameters are physically realistic and dimensionally consistent. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a formal solution can be constructed.\n\nThe task is to derive a self-consistent expression for the steady water volume flux, $J_{v}$, and then compute its numerical value. This proceeds in two main stages: first, the derivation of the governing equations from first principles, and second, the numerical solution of the resulting system.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Governing Equations**\n\nWe begin by modeling the transport processes in the unstirred film and across the membrane.\n\n**1. Solute Transport in the Unstirred Film and Concentration Polarization**\n\nLet us define a one-dimensional coordinate system, $x$, oriented normal to the membrane surface. The origin, $x=0$, is located at the membrane-feed interface, and the coordinate points into the feed solution, such that the unstirred film occupies the region $0 \\le x \\le \\delta$.\n\nThe total flux of solute in the film, $N_s$, is the sum of the convective flux due to water flow and the diffusive flux described by Fick's first law. The water flows towards the membrane, i.e., in the negative $x$-direction, with a volume flux $J_v$. The velocity of this flow is thus $v = -J_v$. The total solute flux in the positive $x$-direction is given by:\n$$N_s(x) = (\\text{convective flux}) + (\\text{diffusive flux}) = v C(x) - D \\frac{dC}{dx} = -J_v C(x) - D \\frac{dC}{dx}$$\nwhere $C(x)$ is the solute concentration at position $x$, and $D$ is the constant solute diffusivity.\n\nAt steady state, the species continuity equation requires that the divergence of the flux is zero. In one dimension, this simplifies to $\\frac{dN_s}{dx} = 0$, which implies that $N_s$ is constant for all $x$ within the film.\n\nA critical boundary condition arises at the membrane surface ($x=0$). The problem states that the membrane is completely solute-rejecting, which is equivalent to a reflection coefficient $\\sigma = 1$. This means that no solute passes through the membrane. Consequently, the solute flux at the membrane surface must be zero: $N_s(0) = 0$.\n\nSince $N_s(x)$ is constant throughout the film, it must be that $N_s(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in [0, \\delta]$. This gives us the governing ordinary differential equation for the concentration profile:\n$$-J_v C(x) - D \\frac{dC}{dx} = 0$$\nwhich can be rearranged to:\n$$\\frac{dC}{C(x)} = -\\frac{J_v}{D} dx$$\nTo find the concentration profile, we integrate this equation across the film. The boundary conditions for the concentration are:\n- At the membrane surface, $x=0$, the concentration is $C(0) = C_m$.\n- At the edge of the unstirred film, $x=\\delta$, the concentration is that of the well-stirred bulk feed, $C(\\delta) = C_b$.\n\nIntegrating from $x=0$ to $x=\\delta$:\n$$\\int_{C_m}^{C_b} \\frac{dC}{C} = \\int_{0}^{\\delta} -\\frac{J_v}{D} dx$$\n$$[\\ln(C)]_{C_m}^{C_b} = -\\frac{J_v}{D} [x]_{0}^{\\delta}$$\n$$\\ln(C_b) - \\ln(C_m) = -\\frac{J_v \\delta}{D}$$\nRearranging gives the relationship between the surface concentration and the bulk concentration:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{C_m}{C_b}\\right) = \\frac{J_v \\delta}{D}$$\nSolving for the concentration at the membrane surface, $C_m$, yields the concentration polarization equation:\n$$C_m = C_b \\exp\\left(\\frac{J_v \\delta}{D}\\right)$$\nThis equation demonstrates that the solute concentration accumulates at the membrane surface, a phenomenon known as concentration polarization.\n\n**2. Water Transport Across the Membrane**\n\nThe water flux across the membrane, $J_v$, is described by the linear hydraulic response model, a simplified form of the Kedem-Katchalsky equations:\n$$J_v = L_p (\\Delta P - \\sigma \\Delta \\pi)$$\nwhere $L_p$ is the hydraulic permeability of the membrane, $\\Delta P$ is the applied transmembrane hydrostatic pressure difference, $\\sigma$ is the reflection coefficient, and $\\Delta \\pi$ is the transmembrane osmotic pressure difference.\n\nThe problem specifies $\\sigma = 1$. The osmotic pressure difference is $\\Delta \\pi = \\pi_{\\text{feed}} - \\pi_{\\text{permeate}}$. The relevant osmotic pressure on the feed side is that at the membrane surface, $\\pi_m$. The permeate is solute-free, so its osmotic pressure $\\pi_p$ is zero. Thus, $\\Delta \\pi = \\pi_m - 0 = \\pi_m$.\n\nThe osmotic pressure is given by the van 't Hoff relation, $\\pi=RTC$. Therefore, $\\pi_m = R T C_m$.\nSubstituting these expressions into the water flux equation gives:\n$$J_v = L_p (\\Delta P - R T C_m)$$\n\n**3. Self-Consistent Determination of $J_v$**\n\nWe now possess a system of two equations with two unknowns, $C_m$ and $J_v$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nC_m = C_b \\exp\\left(\\frac{J_v \\delta}{D}\\right) \\\\\nJ_v = L_p (\\Delta P - R T C_m)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nTo obtain a single, self-consistent equation for $J_v$, we substitute the expression for $C_m$ from the first equation into the second:\n$$J_v = L_p \\left( \\Delta P - R T C_b \\exp\\left(\\frac{J_v \\delta}{D}\\right) \\right)$$\nThis is the final derived transcendental equation that implicitly determines the steady-state water flux $J_v$.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Computation of the Water Flux**\n\nWe now solve this equation using the provided numerical values:\n- $C_b = 300\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n- $D = 1.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $\\delta = 1.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $R = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n- $L_p = 2.78 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $\\Delta P = 1.5 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n\nFirst, we compute the constant terms in the equation.\nThe exponent coefficient grouping is:\n$$\\frac{\\delta}{D} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{1.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$$\nThe bulk osmotic pressure is:\n$$\\pi_b = R T C_b = (8.314\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1})(298\\,\\mathrm{K})(300\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) \\approx 7.4332 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$$\nThe transcendental equation for $J_v$ becomes:\n$$J_v = (2.78 \\times 10^{-12}) \\left( 1.5 \\times 10^{6} - (7.4332 \\times 10^{5}) \\exp\\left( (1.0 \\times 10^{5}) J_v \\right) \\right)$$\nThis equation must be solved numerically. We can use a fixed-point iteration method of the form $J_{v, k+1} = f(J_{v, k})$. An initial guess can be obtained by neglecting concentration polarization (i.e., assuming $C_m=C_b$):\n$$J_{v, 0} = L_p(\\Delta P - \\pi_b) = (2.78 \\times 10^{-12})(1.5 \\times 10^{6} - 7.4332 \\times 10^{5}) \\approx 2.104 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nIterating the equation numerically yields a converged value for the flux.
