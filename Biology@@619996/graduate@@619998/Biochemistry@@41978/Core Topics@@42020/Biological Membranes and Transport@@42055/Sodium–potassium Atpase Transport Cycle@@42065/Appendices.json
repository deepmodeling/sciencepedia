We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part solution: first, to deduce the net charge transferred per pump cycle, and second, to calculate the total transmembrane current. We shall address these in sequence, adhering strictly to the provided first principles.\n\nStep $1$: Deduction of Net Charge Transferred per Turnover\n\nThe sodium-potassium ATPase pump translocates two species of monovalent cations: sodium ($Na^+$) and potassium ($K^+$). The elementary charge is denoted by $e$. The charge of a single sodium ion is $+e$, and the charge of a single potassium ion is also $+e$.\n\nThe pump cycle is defined by the following events:\n$1$. The translocation of $3$ sodium ions from the cytosol to the extracellular space.\n$2$. The translocation of $2$ potassium ions from the extracellular space to the cytosol.\n\nThe sign convention dictates that the outward movement of positive charge constitutes a positive current. We apply this convention to determine the net charge, $q_{pump}$, transferred outward per cycle.\n\nThe outward movement of $3$ $Na^+$ ions, each carrying a charge of $+e$, results in a total charge of $3 \\times (+e) = +3e$ moving out of the cell. According to the sign convention, this corresponds to a charge transfer of $+3e$.\n\nThe inward movement of $2$ $K^+$ ions, each carrying a charge of $+e$, results in a total charge of $2 \\times (+e) = +2e$ moving into the cell. An inward movement of positive charge is electrically equivalent to an outward movement of negative charge. Therefore, this contributes $-2e$ to the net outward charge transfer.\n\nThe net charge transferred outward from the cytosol per single turnover of one pump is the sum of these contributions:\n$$q_{pump} = (+3e) + (-2e) = +e$$\nThus, the pump is electrogenic, creating a net efflux of one elementary positive charge per cycle.\n\nStep $2$: Computation of Total Transmembrane Current\n\nThe total transmembrane current, $I_{total}$, is the cumulative effect of all pumps operating on the cell surface. This is the product of the total number of pumps, $N_{pumps}$, and the current generated by a single pump, $I_{pump}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of pumps. The cell is a sphere of radius $r = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. The surface area $A$ of a sphere is given by:\n$$A = 4\\pi r^2$$\nThe pumps are distributed with a uniform surface density $\\sigma = 1.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\text{pumps}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$. The total number of pumps is therefore:\n$$N_{pumps} = \\sigma \\cdot A = \\sigma \\cdot (4\\pi r^2)$$\n\nNext, we determine the current from a single pump. Electric current is defined as charge transferred per unit time, $I = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta t}$. A single pump operates at a turnover frequency $f = 100\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, meaning it completes $100$ cycles per second. The charge transferred per cycle is $q_{pump} = e$. Therefore, the current generated by one pump is:\n$$I_{pump} = q_{pump} \\cdot f = e \\cdot f$$\n\nThe total current is the product of the number of pumps and the current per pump:\n$$I_{total} = N_{pumps} \\cdot I_{pump} = (\\sigma \\cdot 4\\pi r^2) \\cdot (e \\cdot f)$$\nRearranging the terms gives the complete analytical expression for the total current:\n$$I_{total} = 4\\pi \\sigma f e r^2$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values to compute the final answer.\n-   $r = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $\\sigma = 1.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$\n-   $f = 100\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n-   $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n\nTo simplify calculation and avoid large exponents from unit conversions to SI base units, we can maintain the micrometer units for as long as possible.\nSurface area:\n$$A = 4\\pi (10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m})^2 = 4\\pi (100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2) = 400\\pi\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2$$\nTotal number of pumps:\n$$N_{pumps} = (1.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-2}) \\times (400\\pi\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2) = 4 \\times 10^{5}\\pi\\,\\text{pumps}$$\nTotal current:\n$$I_{total} = N_{pumps} \\cdot f \\cdot e$$\n$$I_{total} = (4 \\times 10^{5}\\pi) \\cdot (100\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C})$$\n$$I_{total} = 4\\pi \\times 10^{7} \\times 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C/s}$$\nThe unit $\\mathrm{C/s}$ is the ampere, $\\mathrm{A}$.\n$$I_{total} = 4\\pi \\times 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A}$$\nThe prefix \"pico\" (p) corresponds to a factor of $10^{-12}$.

It describes a standard biochemical experiment based on established principles of enzyme kinetics. The data and conditions provided are complete, consistent, and physically realistic. The problem requires a standard, non-trivial analysis of kinetic data. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three stages: first, determination of the inhibition mechanism; second, linearization of the appropriate kinetic model; and third, estimation of the inhibition constant $K_i$ via linear regression.\n\nFirst, we must determine the type of inhibition. The general Michaelis-Menten equation for the initial rate of reaction $v$ as a function of substrate concentration $[S]$ is:\n$$v = \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_M + [S]}$$\nwhere $V_{max}$ is the maximum rate and $K_M$ is the Michaelis constant. This equation describes the rate in the absence of an inhibitor, $v(0)$. We are asked to distinguish between competitive and noncompetitive inhibition with respect to the substrate, ATP.\n\nFor competitive inhibition, the inhibitor $I$ competes with the substrate $S$ for the free enzyme $E$. The apparent Michaelis constant is modified to $K_M^{app} = K_M(1 + [I]/K_i)$, while $V_{max}$ is unchanged. The rate in the presence of a competitive inhibitor, $v([I])$, is:\n$$v([I]) = \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_M(1 + [I]/K_i) + [S]}$$\nThe fractional activity, $f_{comp}$, is the ratio $v([I])/v(0)$:\n$$f_{comp} = \\frac{\\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_M(1 + [I]/K_i) + [S]}}{\\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_M + [S]}} = \\frac{K_M + [S]}{K_M(1 + [I]/K_i) + [S]}$$\nThis expression for $f_{comp}$ depends on the substrate concentration $[S]$.\n\nFor noncompetitive inhibition (in its pure form), the inhibitor $I$ can bind to both the free enzyme $E$ and the enzyme-substrate complex $ES$ with the same dissociation constant, $K_i$. This reduces the concentration of active enzyme, thus decreasing the apparent maximum rate to $V_{max}^{app} = V_{max}/(1 + [I]/K_i)$, while $K_M$ is unchanged. The rate in the presence of a noncompetitive inhibitor is:\n$$v([I]) = \\frac{(V_{max}/(1 + [I]/K_i)) [S]}{K_M + [S]}$$\nThe fractional activity, $f_{noncomp}$, is:\n$$f_{noncomp} = \\frac{\\frac{V_{max} [S]}{(1 + [I]/K_i)(K_M + [S])}}{\\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_M + [S]}} = \\frac{1}{1 + [I]/K_i}$$\nThis expression for $f_{noncomp}$ is independent of the substrate concentration $[S]$.\n\nThe provided experimental data show that the fractional activity $f$ is identical at two different ATP concentrations ($[S] = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ and $[S] = 2.00\\,\\mathrm{mM}$) for any given inhibitor concentration $[I]$. This finding decisively rules out the competitive inhibition model and strongly supports the noncompetitive inhibition model. An uncompetitive model, where the inhibitor binds only to the $ES$ complex, would also show dependence on $[S]$, and is thus also ruled out. Therefore, we proceed assuming noncompetitive inhibition.\n\nThe second task is to derive a linear relation from the noncompetitive model that allows for the estimation of $K_i$. The relation for fractional activity is:\n$$f = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}}$$\nThis equation is not linear in $f$ and $[I]$. However, it can be rearranged into a linear form. Taking the reciprocal of both sides yields:\n$$\\frac{1}{f} = 1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}$$\nThis can be written in the form of a linear equation, $y = mx + c$:\n$$\\frac{1}{f} = \\left(\\frac{1}{K_i}\\right)[I] + 1$$\nHere, $y = 1/f$, $x = [I]$, the slope is $m = 1/K_i$, and the y-intercept is $c = 1$. This is a suitable linear relation for our purposes.\n\nThe third task is to perform an unweighted least-squares fit to this linear model using all provided data points to find $K_i$. Since the data for both ATP concentrations are identical, we can pool them. This gives us $6$ unique pairs of $([I], f)$ values, with each data pair occurring twice, for a total of $n=12$ points in our regression analysis. The values of $[I]$ are in $\\mathrm{nM}$. We will calculate $1/f$ for each point.\n\nThe data points $(x, y) = ([I], 1/f)$ are:\n- For $[I] = 0\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $f=1.00 \\Rightarrow 1/f = 1.00$. Point: $(0, 1.00)$.\n- For $[I] = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $f=0.80 \\Rightarrow 1/f = 1.25$. Point: $(5.0, 1.25)$.\n- For $[I] = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $f \\approx 0.6667 \\Rightarrow 1/f = 1.50$.

The mechanistic backbone is that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binds and transfers its terminal phosphate to this conserved aspartate to generate a phosphoenzyme, which then undergoes large-scale conformational changes between inward-facing and outward-facing states (commonly denoted $E1$ and $E2$) that alter cation affinities and accessibilities, followed by hydrolytic dephosphorylation to reset the enzyme. The core chemical requirement is that the side-chain carboxylate of the catalytic aspartate acts as the nucleophile that attacks the $\\gamma$-phosphate of ATP to form a mixed carboxyl–phosphate anhydride (acyl phosphate).\n\nConsider substituting this catalytic aspartate with asparagine (Asp$\\rightarrow$Asn).

ATP binding to the enzyme is largely retained, but covalent aspartyl phosphorylation from ATP is abolished so that $k_{\\text{phos}}\\approx 0$ and no $E\\sim P$ accumulates above background; reverse phosphorylation by $P_i$ is likewise abolished. Because no phosphoenzyme ever forms, hydrolytic dephosphorylation is not detectable under standard conditions (apparent $k_{\\text{dephos}}$ is undefined for the mutant), and the overall steady-state transport flux satisfies $J\\approx 0$ even though cation binding equilibria may still be measurable.\n\nB. The enzyme can reroute phosphorylation to an alternative nucleophilic residue (for example, lysine or serine), resulting in a reduced but nonzero $k_{\\text{phos}}$ and measurable $E\\sim P$; dephosphorylation is modestly slowed, but the transport cycle remains operative with a diminished yet finite flux $J>0$.\n\nC. Eliminating the aspartyl phosphate intermediate removes the slow dephosphorylation step, so although $k_{\\text{phos}}$ is reduced, $k_{\\text{dephos}}$ is effectively increased and the net effect is an increased steady-state flux $J$ at saturating ATP, because fewer steps are rate limiting.\n\nD.

A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe problem requires an analysis of the consequences of an Asp$\\rightarrow$Asn mutation at the catalytic site of the $Na^{+}/K^{+}$-ATPase. The core of the analysis lies in comparing the chemical properties of the aspartate (Asp) side chain with the asparagine (Asn) side chain in the context of the phosphorylation reaction.\n\n1.  **Chemical Reactivity Analysis:**\n    - The side chain of an aspartate residue is $-\\text{CH}_2\\text{COOH}$. At physiological pH, it is deprotonated to the carboxylate form, $-\\text{CH}_2\\text{COO}^-$. This carboxylate anion is a potent nucleophile. The problem statement correctly identifies this functionality as essential for attacking the electrophilic $\\gamma$-phosphorus atom of ATP to form the high-energy acyl phosphate intermediate ($E\\sim P$).\n    - The side chain of an asparagine residue is $-\\text{CH}_2\\text{CONH}_2$. This is a primary amide. Unlike a carboxylate, an amide is a very poor nucleophile. The lone pair of electrons on the amide nitrogen is delocalized through resonance with the adjacent carbonyl group, substantially reducing its availability for nucleophilic attack. The amide group cannot be readily deprotonated to generate a strong nucleophile under physiological conditions.\n    - Therefore, the substitution of the catalytic aspartate with asparagine removes the essential nucleophile required for the phosphorylation reaction.\n\n2.  **Impact on Observables:**\n    - **Observable 1: Phosphoenzyme Formation ($k_{\\text{phos}}$, $E\\sim P$):** Since the Asn side chain lacks the nucleophilic character of the Asp carboxylate, it cannot attack the $\\gamma$-phosphate of ATP. The chemical step of forming the covalent acyl phosphate is blocked. Consequently, the rate constant for this step, $k_{\\text{phos}}$, must approach zero ($k_{\\text{phos}} \\approx 0$). No significant amount of the covalent phosphoenzyme intermediate, $E\\sim P$, will be formed. An experiment using $[\\gamma\\text{-}^{32}\\mathrm{P}]\\text{ATP}$ would show no incorporation of the $^{32}\\mathrm{P}$ label into the enzyme protein above background levels.\n\n    - **Observable 2: Dephosphorylation ($k_{\\text{dephos}}$):** The dephosphorylation reaction is the hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme, i.e., $E2\\sim P + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow E2 + P_i$. This reaction requires the prior formation of its substrate, the phosphoenzyme $E\\sim P$. Since the phosphorylation step is abolished in the Asp$\\rightarrow$Asn mutant, the substrate for dephosphorylation is never generated. Hence, the process of dephosphorylation cannot occur, and its rate constant, $k_{\\text{dephos}}$, becomes an undefined or immeasurable quantity for this mutant under standard assay conditions.\n\n    - **Observable 3: Transport Flux ($J$):** The $Na^{+}/K^{+}$-ATPase cycle is a sequence of coupled chemical and conformational steps. The problem explicitly states that the aspartyl phosphate intermediate is required for energy transduction and that if a required step has a rate constant approaching zero, the overall flux also approaches zero. The formation of $E\\sim P$ is a mandatory step in the cycle. By abolishing this step ($k_{\\text{phos}} \\approx 0$), the entire catalytic cycle is broken. No turnover is possible. Therefore, the steady-state ion transport flux, $J$, must be zero ($J \\approx 0$).\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n- **Option A:** This option states that covalent phosphorylation is abolished ($k_{\\text{phos}} \\approx 0$, no $E\\sim P$ accumulation), reverse phosphorylation from $P_i$ is also abolished, dephosphorylation is not detectable (its rate constant is undefined), and the overall flux is zero ($J \\approx 0$). This aligns perfectly with our step-by-step derivation from first principles. The possibility of retained ATP or cation binding does not change the central conclusion about the abrogation of catalysis. This option is a complete and accurate description of the expected outcome.\n  **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **Option B:** This option speculates that phosphorylation could be rerouted to another residue, leading to a diminished but non-zero flux ($J > 0$). This is an ad-hoc hypothesis that contradicts the principle of a highly specific active site architecture. The catalytic aspartate is conserved precisely because of its unique chemical and positional suitability. Assuming a spontaneous, alternative catalytic mechanism is not an argument from first principles but rather a speculative guess against the known high fidelity of enzyme active sites.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **Option C:** This option claims that eliminating the phosphoenzyme intermediate would increase the net flux ($J$). This demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of enzyme kinetics. Removing a required intermediate in a cyclic pathway does not accelerate the cycle by removing a \"slow step\"; it breaks the cycle entirely, halting all flux. The premise is nonsensical.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **Option D:** This option correctly states that forward phosphorylation from ATP is blocked ($k_{\\text{phos}} \\approx 0$) but incorrectly claims that reverse phosphorylation from $P_i$ remains possible. The chemical incompetence of the asparagine side chain to act as a phosphate acceptor is intrinsic to its structure. It cannot accept a phosphate group regardless of the donor (ATP or $P_i$). The premise that a partial cycle could be sustained via reverse phosphorylation is therefore false.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nFinal conclusion is that Option A provides the only chemically and kinetically sound prediction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2605965"}]}
