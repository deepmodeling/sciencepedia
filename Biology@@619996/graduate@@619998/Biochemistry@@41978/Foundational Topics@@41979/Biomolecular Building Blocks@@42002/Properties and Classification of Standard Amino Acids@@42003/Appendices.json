All necessary data, specifically the acid dissociation constants ($pK_a$) for the three titratable groups of histidine, are provided. The problem is a standard exercise in biochemistry and physical chemistry, solvable through the application of fundamental principles of acid-base equilibria. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe amino acid histidine possesses three ionizable groups: the $\\alpha$-carboxyl group ($pK_{a1} = 1.80$), the imidazole side chain ($pK_{a2} = 6.04$), and the $\\alpha$-amino group ($pK_{a3} = 9.33$). Let us denote the various protonated forms of histidine as $H_3A^{2+}$, $H_2A^{+}$, $HA^0$, and $A^{-}$. The ionization states change sequentially as the $pH$ of the solution increases.\n\nAt a very low $pH$, all three groups are protonated. The molecule exists as $H_3A^{2+}$, with a net charge of $+2$ (from the protonated amino group, $+1$, and the protonated imidazole ring, $+1$).\n\nThe first deprotonation event occurs at the most acidic group, the $\\alpha$-carboxyl group, and is governed by $pK_{a1}$:\n$$H_3A^{2+} \\rightleftharpoons H_2A^{+} + H^+ \\quad (pK_{a1} = 1.80)$$\nThe resulting species, $H_2A^{+}$, has a net charge of $+1$ (from the protonated amino group, $+1$, the protonated imidazole ring, $+1$, and the deprotonated carboxylate group, $-1$).\n\nThe second deprotonation occurs at the imidazole side chain, governed by $pK_{a2}$:\n$$H_2A^{+} \\rightleftharpoons HA^{0} + H^+ \\quad (pK_{a2} = 6.04)$$\nThe resulting species, $HA^0$, has a net charge of $0$. This is the zwitterionic or electrically neutral microstate. The charges of its functional groups are: protonated amino group ($+1$), neutral imidazole ring ($0$), and deprotonated carboxylate group ($-1$).\n\nThe third deprotonation occurs at the least acidic group, the $\\alpha$-amino group, and is governed by $pK_{a3}$:\n$$HA^{0} \\rightleftharpoons A^{-} + H^+ \\quad (pK_{a3} = 9.33)$$\nThe resulting species, $A^{-}$, has a net charge of $-1$ (from the deprotonated carboxylate group).\n\nThe isoelectric point ($pI$) is the $pH$ at which the average net charge of the population of molecules is zero. The electrically neutral species $HA^0$ is formed from $H_2A^{+}$ and dissociates into $A^{-}$. Therefore, the two equilibria that \"straddle\" the neutral species are those described by $K_{a2}$ and $K_{a3}$. The corresponding $pK_a$ values are $pK_{a2} = 6.04$ and $pK_{a3} = 9.33$.\n\nAt the $pI$, the total concentration of positive charges must equal the total concentration of negative charges. In this system, this condition is formally written as:\n$$2[H_3A^{2+}] + [H_2A^{+}] = [A^{-}]$$\nHowever, because the $pI$ will be significantly higher than $pK_{a1}$ ($1.80$), the concentration of the doubly-positive species, $[H_3A^{2+}]$, will be negligible compared to the concentration of the singly-positive species, $[H_2A^{+}]$. Thus, the condition for the isoelectric point can be simplified to a very good approximation:\n$$[H_2A^{+}] \\approx [A^{-}]$$\nThis approximation states that at the $pI$, the concentrations of the charged species immediately adjacent to the zwitterion are equal.\n\nWe now use the law of mass action for the two relevant equilibria, expressed via their acid dissociation constants, $K_{a2}$ and $K_{a3}$:\n$$K_{a2} = \\frac{[HA^0][H^+]}{[H_2A^{+}]} \\implies [H_2A^{+}] = \\frac{[HA^0][H^+]}{K_{a2}}$$\n$$K_{a3} = \\frac{[A^{-}][H^+]}{[HA^0]} \\implies [A^{-}] = \\frac{K_{a3}[HA^0]}{[H^+]}$$\nWe substitute these expressions into our simplified charge balance equation, $[H_2A^{+}] = [A^{-}]$:\n$$\\frac{[HA^0][H^+]}{K_{a2}} = \\frac{K_{a3}[HA^0]}{[H^+]}$$\nThe concentration of the neutral species, $[HA^0]$, is non-zero at the $pI$ and can be cancelled from both sides of the equation:\n$$\\frac{[H^+]}{K_{a2}} = \\frac{K_{a3}}{[H^+]}$$\nLet $[H^+]_{pI}$ be the hydrogen ion concentration at the isoelectric point. Rearranging the equation to solve for $[H^+]_{pI}$:\n$$[H^+]_{pI}^2 = K_{a2} K_{a3}$$\n$$[H^+]_{pI} = \\sqrt{K_{a2} K_{a3}}$$\nTo find the $pI$, we take the negative base-10 logarithm of both sides.

It is a standard, well-formulated problem in chemical reactivity that tests the application of multiple competing chemical principles. I will now proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of the nucleophilicity of cysteine thiolate and serine alkoxide. We must consider the intrinsic properties of the nucleophiles and how they are affected by the solvent and the electrophile.\n\n**1. Intrinsic Properties of the Nucleophiles:**\n- **Basicity:** The basicity of a species is related to the acidity of its conjugate acid. A higher $pK_a$ of the conjugate acid corresponds to a stronger base. Given $pK_a(\\text{Ser–OH}) \\approx 13$ and $pK_a(\\text{Cys–SH}) \\approx 8.3$, the serine alkoxide ($\\text{Ser-O}^-$) is a significantly stronger base than the cysteine thiolate ($\\text{Cys-S}^-$). The difference is approximately $13 - 8.3 = 4.7$ $pK_a$ units, which corresponds to a factor of $10^{4.7}$ in basicity.\n- **Polarizability and HSAB Classification:** Sulfur (Period 3) is a larger, more polarizable atom than oxygen (Period 2). Therefore, the thiolate ($\\text{Cys-S}^-$) is a soft nucleophile, whereas the alkoxide ($\\text{Ser-O}^-$) is a hard nucleophile.\n- **Properties of Electrophiles:** The electrophilic carbon in $\\mathrm{CH_3I}$ is considered a soft electrophilic center due to its attachment to the large, polarizable iodine atom. The carbon in $\\mathrm{CH_3Cl}$ is a borderline, or less soft, electrophilic center.\n\n**2. Analysis in Water (Polar Protic Solvent):**\nIn a polar protic solvent like water, anions are solvated by hydrogen bonding. According to principle (ii), this solvation is strongest for small, hard, and highly basic anions. The serine alkoxide is hard, highly basic, and smaller than the thiolate. Consequently, it will be very strongly solvated by water molecules. This strong solvation shell \"cages\" the nucleophile, sterically hindering its approach to an electrophile and energetically stabilizing its ground state, both of which increase the activation energy for reaction and thus decrease its nucleophilicity. The cysteine thiolate, being larger, softer, and less basic, is much less strongly solvated. This difference in solvation is the dominant factor determining relative nucleophilicity in protic solvents. The greater polarizability of sulfur also contributes to its high nucleophilicity. Therefore, despite being a weaker base, the thiolate is a much more potent nucleophile than the alkoxide in water. This holds true for both electrophiles.\n**Prediction for Water:** $k(\\text{thiolate}) \\gg k(\\text{alkoxide})$ for both $\\mathrm{CH_3Cl}$ and $\\mathrm{CH_3I}$.\n\n**3. Analysis in $N,N$-Dimethylformamide (Polar Aprotic Solvent):**\nIn a polar aprotic solvent like DMF, anions are poorly solvated. They are \"naked\" and more reactive. According to principle (iii), nucleophilicity in such solvents tends to correlate with basicity. However, this trend is modulated by polarizability and HSAB interactions, as stated in principles (iii) and (iv).\n- **Reaction with $\\mathrm{CH_3Cl}$:** The serine alkoxide is a much stronger base than the thiolate. The electrophile $\\mathrm{CH_3Cl}$ is borderline. In the absence of strong solvating effects, the higher basicity of the alkoxide is a major driver of nucleophilicity. Thus, it is expected to be more reactive than the thiolate. We predict $k(\\text{alkoxide}) \\gtrsim k(\\text{thiolate})$ for $\\mathrm{CH_3Cl}$.\n- **Reaction with $\\mathrm{CH_3I}$:** The electrophile $\\mathrm{CH_3I}$ is a classic soft electrophile. According to principle (iv), the reaction between the soft thiolate nucleophile and the soft methyl iodide electrophile will have a particularly stable transition state due to favorable soft-soft HSAB interactions. This enhanced stabilization can overcome the basicity advantage of the hard alkoxide, whose reaction with the soft electrophile (hard-soft interaction) is less favorable. Therefore, the nucleophilicity order may invert for this specific combination.\n**Prediction for DMF:** $k(\\text{alkoxide}) \\gtrsim k(\\text{thiolate})$ for $\\mathrm{CH_3Cl}$, but $k(\\text{thiolate}) \\gtrsim k(\\text{alkoxide})$ for $\\mathrm{CH_3I}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In water, $k(\\text{thiolate}) \\gg k(\\text{alkoxide})$ for both methyl chloride and methyl iodide because the thiolate is more polarizable and is less strongly hydrogen-bond solvated; in $N,N$-dimethylformamide$, k(\\text{alkoxide}) > k(\\text{thiolate})$ for both alkyl halides because basicity dominates nucleophilicity without significant contribution from polarizability.**\nThe analysis for water is correct. The analysis for DMF is incorrect because it fails to account for the impact of HSAB interactions (principle iv), especially for the soft electrophile $\\mathrm{CH_3I}$. The claim that polarizability makes no significant contribution is false.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. In water, $k(\\text{thiolate}) > k(\\text{alkoxide})$ for both methyl chloride and methyl iodide because the alkoxide is more strongly hydrogen-bond solvated and thus less reactive; in $N,N$-dimethylformamide$, k(\\text{alkoxide}) \\gtrsim k(\\text{thiolate})$ for methyl chloride as nucleophilicity tracks the higher basicity of the alkoxide, whereas $k(\\text{thiolate}) \\gtrsim k(\\text{alkoxide})$ for methyl iodide because the softer, more polarizable thiolate benefits from HSAB matching with the softer methyl iodide.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with the detailed derivation.\n- It correctly identifies strong solvation of alkoxide as the key factor in water (principle ii).\n- In DMF, it correctly differentiates the behavior toward the two electrophiles, invoking basicity for $\\mathrm{CH_3Cl}$ (principle iii) and HSAB matching for $\\mathrm{CH_3I}$ (principle iv). This is the most complete and nuanced analysis.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. In water, $k(\\text{alkoxide}) > k(\\text{thiolate})$ because the alkoxide is the stronger base; in $N,N$-dimethylformamide$, k(\\text{thiolate}) > k(\\text{alkoxide})$ for both alkyl halides because sulfur polarizability dominates nucleophilicity in the absence of hydrogen bonding.**\nThe prediction for water is incorrect. It ignores the dominant effect of protic solvation (principle ii) and mistakenly applies the basicity trend. The nucleophilicity trend is inverted relative to the basicity trend in protic solvents for nucleophiles of different periods.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Solvent has minimal effect on the relative rates; the stronger base is always the better nucleophile, so $k(\\text{alkoxide}) \\gg k(\\text{thiolate})$ for both methyl chloride and methyl iodide in both water and $N,N$-dimethylformamide$.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The premise that \"Solvent has minimal effect\" is grossly incorrect, as solvent effects are critical in $\\mathrm{S_N2}$ reactions. The generalization that \"the stronger base is always the better nucleophile\" is also incorrect, as demonstrated by the case in protic solvents.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2590595"}]}
