This exercise explores the mechanistic basis for RNA's inherent lability under alkaline conditions, a property not shared by DNA. By working through this problem, you will connect the presence of the $2'$-hydroxyl group to a specific intramolecular reaction pathway and use kinetic principles to quantify its pH dependence, a classic example of structure dictating reactivity in biochemistry [@problem_id:2582800].", "problem": "A short, single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) oligomer and a sequence-matched deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) oligomer are incubated separately under alkaline conditions at $25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ in dilute aqueous buffer lacking metal ions. Experimentally, RNA forms a $2^{\\prime},3^{\\prime}$-cyclic phosphate intermediate and fragments rapidly, whereas DNA remains comparatively stable on the same time scale. Starting only from fundamental Brønsted–Lowry acid–base concepts, the requirement for an in-line nucleophilic substitution at phosphorus in a phosphodiester, and elementary reaction kinetics, rationalize mechanistically why RNA is susceptible to base-catalyzed intramolecular transesterification via a $2^{\\prime}$-O nucleophile, while DNA lacks this pathway due to the absence of the $2^{\\prime}$-OH group. Then, using that mechanistic model, estimate how the pseudo-first-order cleavage rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ for each polymer changes when the potential of hydrogen (pH) is increased from $11.0$ to $13.0$. Assume the following physically reasonable facts and definitions as starting points:\n- The acid dissociation constant of the ribose $2^{\\prime}$-OH in the polymeric context is $pK_a = 12.5$.\n- For RNA, the intramolecular pathway becomes first-order in the fraction of deprotonated $2^{\\prime}$-OH and approaches a maximal first-order rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{int,max}}$ when the $2^{\\prime}$-OH is fully deprotonated.\n- For DNA, in the absence of a $2^{\\prime}$-OH, alkaline cleavage proceeds only via bimolecular hydroxide attack at phosphorus with second-order rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{OH}}$; under conditions where hydroxide is in large excess, the observed rate is pseudo-first-order with $k_{\\mathrm{obs}} = k_{\\mathrm{OH}}[\\mathrm{OH}^{-}]$.\n- Take the water ion product at $25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to be $K_w = 10^{-14}$, so that $[\\mathrm{OH}^{-}] = 10^{\\mathrm{pH}-14}\\ \\mathrm{M}$.\n\nWhich option best matches both the mechanistic explanation and the quantitative pH-dependence of $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ for RNA and DNA over this pH range?\n\nA. RNA: Deprotonation of the $2^{\\prime}$-OH generates a $2^{\\prime}$-O$^{-}$ that can perform an in-line intramolecular attack on the adjacent phosphorus to give a $2^{\\prime},3^{\\prime}$-cyclic phosphate and expel the $5^{\\prime}$-oxygen; the observed rate scales with the deprotonated fraction and increases by approximately $25$-fold from pH $11.0$ to pH $13.0$, then plateaus near the $2^{\\prime}$-OH $pK_a$. DNA: Lacking a $2^{\\prime}$-OH, no analogous intramolecular path exists; cleavage is dominated by intermolecular hydroxide attack with $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}\\propto[\\mathrm{OH}^{-}]$, increasing by approximately $100$-fold from pH $11.0$ to pH $13.0$.\n\nB. RNA: Intramolecular transesterification requires protonation of the leaving group, so the rate decreases with increasing pH; the observed rate drops by approximately $10$-fold from pH $11.0$ to pH $13.0$. DNA: Also decreases in rate because hydroxide sequesters as water; the observed rate is approximately constant with pH.\n\nC. RNA and DNA both cleave primarily by identical intermolecular hydroxide attack at phosphorus; both $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ values increase by approximately $100$-fold from pH $11.0$ to pH $13.0$, with no plateau for RNA since intramolecular effects are negligible.\n\nD. RNA increases by approximately $25$-fold and DNA by approximately $100$-fold from pH $11.0$ to pH $13.0$, but the difference arises because DNA has a higher sugar hydroxyl $pK_a$ than RNA, so its intramolecular transesterification requires stronger base to generate a $3^{\\prime}$-O$^{-}$ internal nucleophile that can substitute to form a $3^{\\prime},5^{\\prime}$-cyclic phosphate.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **System**: A single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) oligomer and a sequence-matched deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) oligomer.\n- **Conditions**: Alkaline, $25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, dilute aqueous buffer, no metal ions.\n- **Experimental Observation**: RNA rapidly fragments via a $2^{\\prime},3^{\\prime}$-cyclic phosphate intermediate; DNA remains stable.\n- **Principles for Analysis**: Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory, in-line nucleophilic substitution at phosphorus, elementary reaction kinetics.\n- **Specific Assumptions and Definitions**:\n    - For RNA, the $pK_a$ of the $2^{\\prime}$-OH is $12.5$.\n    - For RNA, the rate-determining step for the intramolecular pathway is first-order in the fraction of deprotonated $2^{\\prime}$-OH.

The alkaline lability of RNA due to its $2^{\\prime}$-OH group, proceeding through a $2^{\\prime},3^{\\prime}$-cyclic phosphate intermediate, is a cornerstone of nucleic acid chemistry. The relative stability of DNA due to the absence of the $2^{\\prime}$-OH is equally fundamental. The kinetic models provided are standard representations for such reactions. The $pK_a$ value is physically reasonable. The problem is chemically sound.\n- **Posing and Objectivity**: The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient information to derive a unique mechanistic explanation and a quantitative estimate. The language is precise, objective, and free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution will now be derived.\n\n**Part I: Mechanistic Rationalization**\n\nThe profound difference in alkaline stability between RNA and DNA arises directly from a small but critical structural distinction: the presence of a hydroxyl group at the $2^{\\prime}$-position of the ribose sugar in RNA, and its absence in the $2^{\\prime}$-deoxyribose of DNA.\n\n- **RNA Alkaline Hydrolysis**:\nUnder alkaline conditions, the hydroxide ion, $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, acts as a Brønsted–Lowry base, abstracting the acidic proton from the $2^{\\prime}$-hydroxyl group of a ribonucleotide residue.\n$$ \\mathrm{R(2^{\\prime})-OH} + \\mathrm{OH}^{-} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{R(2^{\\prime})-O}^{-} + \\mathrm{H_2O} $$\nThis generates a $2^{\\prime}$-alkoxide, $\\mathrm{R(2^{\\prime})-O}^{-}$, which is a potent intramolecular nucleophile. The stereochemical arrangement of the ribose-phosphate backbone allows this nucleophile to readily adopt a conformation for an in-line attack on the adjacent phosphorus atom. This geometry, where the nucleophile ($2^{\\prime}$-O), the phosphorus center, and the leaving group (the $5^{\\prime}$-oxygen of the next nucleotide) are collinear (approximately $180^{\\circ}$), is requisite for nucleophilic substitution at a pentacoordinate phosphorus center. The attack results in a trigonal bipyramidal transition state (or short-lived intermediate). This structure collapses by cleaving the P-O5' bond, expelling the $5^{\\prime}$-portion of the chain as a leaving group. The products are a fragment terminating in a $2^{\\prime},3^{\\prime}$-cyclic phosphodiester and a second fragment with a free $5^{\\prime}$-hydroxyl group. This intramolecular pathway is kinetically facile due to the high effective concentration of the tethered nucleophile, leading to the observed rapid degradation of RNA.\n\n- **DNA Alkaline Stability**:\nDNA lacks the $2^{\\prime}$-hydroxyl group. Consequently, a $2^{\\prime}$-alkoxide cannot be formed. The intramolecular transesterification pathway described for RNA is therefore impossible for DNA. Cleavage of the phosphodiester backbone in DNA under alkaline conditions can only occur via an intermolecular pathway: direct nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus atom by a hydroxide ion from the bulk solution. This is a bimolecular process ($S_N2$-type at phosphorus) and is substantially slower than the intramolecular reaction in RNA because it relies on the relatively infrequent and random collision of a hydroxide ion with the sterically shielded phosphodiester backbone. This inherent mechanistic difference accounts for the much greater stability of DNA in alkaline solution.\n\n**Part II: Quantitative pH-Dependence of Cleavage Rates**\n\nWe will now calculate the ratio of the observed pseudo-first-order rate constants, $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, at $\\mathrm{pH} = 13.0$ versus $\\mathrm{pH} = 11.0$.\n\n- **RNA Cleavage Rate ($k_{\\mathrm{obs, RNA}}$)**:\nThe rate is proportional to the fraction of deprotonated $2^{\\prime}$-OH groups, $f_{2^{\\prime}\\text{-O}^{-}}$. This fraction is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, given the $pK_a = 12.5$.\nThe fraction of the deprotonated form is given by:\n$$ f_{2^{\\prime}\\text{-O}^{-}} = \\frac{10^{\\mathrm{pH} - pK_a}}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - pK_a}} $$\nThe observed rate constant is $k_{\\mathrm{obs, RNA}} = k_{\\mathrm{int,max}} \\cdot f_{2^{\\prime}\\text{-O}^{-}}$.\n\nAt $\\mathrm{pH} = 11.0$:\n$$ f_{2^{\\prime}\\text{-O}^{-}}(\\mathrm{pH}=11.0) = \\frac{10^{11.0 - 12.5}}{1 + 10^{11.0 - 12.5}} = \\frac{10^{-1.5}}{1 + 10^{-1.5}} \\approx \\frac{0.03162}{1.03162} \\approx 0.03065 $$\nAt $\\mathrm{pH} = 13.0$:\n$$ f_{2^{\\prime}\\text{-O}^{-}}(\\mathrm{pH}=13.0) = \\frac{10^{13.0 - 12.5}}{1 + 10^{13.0 - 12.5}} = \\frac{10^{0.5}}{1 + 10^{0.5}} \\approx \\frac{3.1623}{4.1623} \\approx 0.7597 $$\nThe ratio of the rates is:\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{obs, RNA}}(\\mathrm{pH}=13.0)}{k_{\\mathrm{obs, RNA}}(\\mathrm{pH}=11.0)} = \\frac{f_{2^{\\prime}\\text{-O}^{-}}(\\mathrm{pH}=13.0)}{f_{2^{\\prime}\\text{-O}^{-}}(\\mathrm{pH}=11.0)} \\approx \\frac{0.7597}{0.03065} \\approx 24.79 $$\nThus, the RNA cleavage rate increases by approximately a factor of $25$. The rate profile is sigmoidal and begins to plateau as the pH increases past the $pK_a$.\n\n- **DNA Cleavage Rate ($k_{\\mathrm{obs, DNA}}$)**:\nThe rate is given by the pseudo-first-order expression $k_{\\mathrm{obs, DNA}} = k_{\\mathrm{OH}}[\\mathrm{OH}^{-}]$, where $[\\mathrm{OH}^{-}] = 10^{\\mathrm{pH}-14}\\ \\mathrm{M}$. The rate is directly proportional to the hydroxide concentration.\n\nAt $\\mathrm{pH} = 11.0$:\n$$ [\\mathrm{OH}^{-}] = 10^{11.0 - 14} = 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{M} $$\nAt $\\mathrm{pH} = 13.0$:\n$$ [\\mathrm{OH}^{-}] = 10^{13.0 - 14} = 10^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{M} $$\nThe ratio of the rates is:\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{obs, DNA}}(\\mathrm{pH}=13.0)}{k_{\\mathrm{obs, DNA}}(\\mathrm{pH}=11.0)} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{OH}} \\cdot (10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{M})}{k_{\\mathrm{OH}} \\cdot (10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{M})} = \\frac{10^{-1}}{10^{-3}} = 10^2 = 100 $$\nThus, the DNA cleavage rate increases by exactly a factor of $100$. This rate does not plateau but increases linearly with $[\\mathrm{OH}^{-}]$.\n\n**Part III: Evaluation of Options**\n\n- **Option A**: This option correctly states that RNA cleavage proceeds via intramolecular attack by the deprotonated $2^{\\prime}$-O$^{-}$ to form a $2^{\\prime},3^{\\prime}$-cyclic phosphate. It correctly states that DNA lacks this pathway and is cleaved by intermolecular hydroxide attack. It correctly estimates the RNA rate increase as approximately $25$-fold and notes the plateauing behavior near the $pK_a$. It correctly calculates the DNA rate increase as $100$-fold. This option is fully consistent with our derivation. **Correct**.\n\n- **Option B**: This option claims the rate decreases with increasing pH, which is mechanistically incorrect. The generation of the nucleophile is enhanced at higher pH. The quantitative predictions are also incorrect. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **Option C**: This option incorrectly asserts that RNA and DNA cleave by the same intermolecular mechanism. This contradicts the fundamental reason for their differential stability. While it correctly predicts the rate increase for DNA, it is incorrect for RNA, both mechanistically and quantitatively. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **Option D**: This option provides the correct quantitative estimates for the rate increases but gives a profoundly flawed mechanistic explanation. It invokes a non-existent intramolecular pathway for DNA involving a $3^{\\prime}$-O$^{-}$ nucleophile and the formation of a \"$3^{\\prime},5^{\\prime}$-cyclic phosphate,\" which is a misinterpretation of both the reaction and the structure of the phosphodiester backbone. The stability of DNA is due to the absence of the $2^{\\prime}$-OH, not the properties of other hydroxyls. **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis, Option A is the only one that provides a scientifically accurate description of both the reaction mechanisms and the quantitative pH dependence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2582800"}, {"introduction": "The statement that ATP is the \"energy currency\" of the cell is often simplified; the actual energetic value of its hydrolysis is highly dependent on the cellular environment.

I will proceed to derive the solution by analyzing each option.\n\n**Analysis of Options**\n\n**Option A: AMP-PNP and AMP-PCP retain ground-state tetrahedral polyphosphate geometry and sufficient interphosphate spacing to engage native binding and conformational closure, but they strongly disfavor the chemical step because replacing the $\\beta{\\text{–}}\\gamma$ bridging $P{-}O$ with $P{-}N$ (PNP) or $P{-}C$ (PCP) eliminates a good leaving group from the apical position in the pentacoordinate transition state, thereby trapping prehydrolytic enzyme–nucleotide complexes.**\n\nThis statement is correct.\n1.  **Structural Mimicry:** AMP-PNP replaces the $\\beta{\\text{–}}\\gamma$ bridging oxygen of ATP with an imido ($\\text{NH}$) group, and AMP-PCP replaces it with a methylene ($\\mathrm{CH}_2$) group. While the bond lengths and angles of $P{-}N{-}P$ and $P{-}C{-}P$ are slightly different from the $P{-}O{-}P$ linkage, they are sufficiently similar to allow these analogs to bind to the ATP-binding pocket of most enzymes. They are considered ground-state analogs, as the phosphorus centers remain in a stable tetrahedral geometry.\n2.  **Chemical Reactivity:** The key to this statement is the lability of the bond that must be cleaved. Phosphoryl transfer from ATP involves the cleavage of a phosphoanhydride bond ($P{-}O{-}P$), which is energetically favorable. The leaving group is ADP, a relatively stable anion. In contrast, the phosphoamide bond ($P{-}N{-}P$) in AMP-PNP and the C-P bond within the phosphonate structure of AMP-PCP are far more resistant to nucleophilic attack and hydrolysis. The imide or methylene-bisphosphonate anion that would result from cleavage are extremely poor, unstable leaving groups compared to ADP.\n3.  **Application:** Because these analogs bind but are essentially non-reactive (or react at an infinitesimally slow rate), they are classic tools for \"trapping\" an enzyme in the pre-catalytic state. This allows for the study of the enzyme-substrate complex, often by X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy, to observe the conformational state induced by substrate binding just before the chemical step.\nThe statement accurately describes the properties and utility of AMP-PNP and AMP-PCP.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option B: ATP$\\gamma$S replaces a nonbridging oxygen on the $\\gamma$-phosphate with sulfur, a larger and softer donor, which weakens $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ coordination and typically slows the chemical step relative to ATP while still permitting transfer of a thiophosphoryl group to acceptors; this enables thiophosphorylation-based trapping of otherwise labile phosphoproteins and stereochemical probes of in-line attack.**\n\nThis statement is correct.\n1.  **Structure and Metal Coordination:** ATP$\\gamma$S substitutes a nonbridging oxygen on the terminal ($\\gamma$) phosphate with a sulfur atom. According to Hard-Soft Acid-Base (HSAB) theory, the hard Lewis acid $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ preferentially coordinates to hard Lewis bases like oxygen over softer bases like sulfur. This weakened coordination to the $\\gamma$-phosphate perturbs the catalytic mechanism, as $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ is crucial for neutralizing charge buildup in the transition state and for properly orienting the substrate.\n2.  **Reactivity:** The result of this perturbed coordination is a reduction in the rate of phosphoryl transfer. However, the scissile $\\beta{\\text{–}}\\gamma$ phosphoanhydride bond ($P{-}O{-}P$) is still present, so the molecule remains a substrate, albeit a slower one than ATP. The reaction proceeds to transfer a thiophosphoryl group.\n3.  **Application:** The resulting thiophosphoester linkage on the protein substrate ($Protein{-}O{-}P(S)O_2^-$) is typically more resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis by phosphatases than a normal phosphoester. This increased stability makes ATP$\\gamma$S an excellent tool for accumulating and identifying transiently phosphorylated proteins. Furthermore, the introduction of sulfur creates a chiral center at the $\\gamma$-phosphorus, which is the basis for stereochemical experiments, as mentioned in option E.\nThe statement correctly summarizes the key features and applications of ATP$\\gamma$S.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option C: Because the $P{-}N$ bond is more labile than $P{-}O$, AMP-PNP generally increases the rate of the chemical step in ATPases by providing a superior leaving group, thereby elevating $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ above that with ATP.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. It is founded on a false chemical premise. A phosphoamide bond ($P{-}N$) is substantially more stable and resistant to hydrolysis than a phosphoanhydride bond ($P{-}O{-}P$). The nitrogen atom is less electronegative than oxygen, and the resulting imide anion would be a much stronger base (and therefore a much worse leaving group) than the corresponding phosphate anion. Consequently, AMP-PNP acts as an inhibitor or a very poor substrate, not an accelerator of the reaction. It drastically reduces $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$, which is precisely why it is termed a \"non-hydrolyzable\" analog.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option D: The methylene analog AMP-PCP enforces a trigonal planar phosphorus that resembles the transition state for phosphoryl transfer, making AMP-PCP a competitive transition-state analog rather than a ground-state mimic.**\n\nThis statement contains two major errors.\n1.  **Geometry of AMP-PCP:** The phosphorus atoms in AMP-PCP, including those bonded to the methylene carbon, retain their characteristic tetrahedral geometry, similar to the phosphates in ATP. There is no structural feature that would enforce a trigonal planar geometry.\n2.  **Geometry of the Transition State:** The transition state for an in-line phosphoryl transfer is a pentacoordinate trigonal *bipyramidal* species, not trigonal planar. This geometry involves the incoming nucleophile and the leaving group at the apical positions and three oxygen atoms in the equatorial plane.\nBecause AMP-PCP possesses a stable tetrahedral phosphorus center, it is a mimic of the *ground-state* substrate, ATP, not the high-energy *transition state*. Analogs like vanadate, which can form stable pentacoordinate structures, are examples of transition-state analogs for phosphoryl transfer.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option E: Diastereomerically pure ATP$\\gamma$S $\\left(R_p \\text{ or } S_p\\right)$ can be used to diagnose an in-line phosphoryl transfer that proceeds with inversion at phosphorus by correlating which diastereomer reacts and by tracking the configuration of the thiophosphoryl group installed on the acceptor.**\n\nThis statement is correct. The substitution of a nonbridging oxygen by sulfur at the $\\gamma$-phosphorus ($P_\\gamma$) of ATP creates a chiral center. The resulting molecules are a pair of diastereomers, designated with $R_p$ and $S_p$ stereochemistry at the phosphorus. An in-line ($S_N2$-type) nucleophilic attack at this phosphorus center is stereospecific and proceeds with inversion of configuration (a Walden inversion). Therefore, if the enzyme uses the $S_p$ diastereomer of ATP$\\gamma$S as a substrate, the thiophosphoryl group transferred to the acceptor will have the $R_p$ configuration. Conversely, transfer from the $R_p$ starting material would yield an $S_p$ product. By synthesizing stereochemically pure ATP$\\gamma$S, performing the enzymatic reaction, and then determining the stereochemistry of the product, one can unequivocally determine the stereochemical course of the reaction. This is a classic and powerful experiment in mechanistic enzymology.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nFinal conclusion: Statements A, B, and E are correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABE}$$", "id": "2582803"}]}
