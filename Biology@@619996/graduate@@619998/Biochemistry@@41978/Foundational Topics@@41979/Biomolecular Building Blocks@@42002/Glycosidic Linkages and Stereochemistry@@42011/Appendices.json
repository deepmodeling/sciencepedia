It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective, with a complete and consistent setup. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is addressed in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Qualitative Distinction of Anomers\nThe magnitude of the vicinal coupling constant, $\\,^{3}J_{\\mathrm{H}1,\\mathrm{H}2}\\,$, is critically dependent on the dihedral angle, $\\theta$, defined by the proton-carbon-carbon-proton bond path $\\mathrm{H}1$–$\\mathrm{C}1$–$\\mathrm{C}2$–$\\mathrm{H}2$. The stereochemical configuration at the anomeric carbon ($\\mathrm{C}1$) determines this angle.\n\nFor the $\\beta$-anomer of D-glucopyranoside in the ${}^{4}C_{1}$ chair conformation, the problem states that the anomeric proton, $\\mathrm{H}1$, is in an axial position. The proton at $\\mathrm{C}2$, $\\mathrm{H}2$, is also specified to be in an axial position. This results in a diaxial relationship between $\\mathrm{H}1$ and $\\mathrm{H}2$. In an ideal chair conformation, a diaxial arrangement corresponds to a dihedral angle of $\\theta = 180^{\\circ}$ (antiperiplanar). The problem provides a realistic value of $\\theta_{\\beta} = 170^{\\circ}$ to account for slight ring distortions. According to the Karplus relationship and the provided qualitative trend, dihedral angles near $180^{\\circ}$ result in a large coupling constant.\n\nFor the $\\alpha$-anomer, the problem states that the anomeric proton, $\\mathrm{H}1$, is in an equatorial position. The proton $\\mathrm{H}2$ remains in an axial position. This results in an equatorial-axial relationship between $\\mathrm{H}1$ and $\\mathrm{H}2$. In an ideal chair conformation, an equatorial-axial arrangement corresponds to a dihedral angle of approximately $\\theta_{\\alpha} \\approx 60^{\\circ}$ (gauche or synclinal). The Karplus equation, $\\,^{3}J(\\theta) = A \\cos^{2}\\theta + B \\cos\\theta + C$, predicts that coupling constants for gauche arrangements ($\\theta \\approx 60^{\\circ}$) are significantly smaller than for antiperiplanar arrangements ($\\theta \\approx 180^{\\circ}$), as $\\cos^{2}(60^{\\circ}) = (\\frac{1}{2})^{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$, whereas $\\cos^{2}(180^{\\circ}) = (-1)^{2} = 1$.\n\nTherefore, one can distinguish between the anomers by measuring the $\\,^{3}J_{\\mathrm{H}1,\\mathrm{H}2}\\,$ coupling constant. The $\\beta$-anomer will exhibit a large coupling constant (typically $7-10$ Hz), indicative of the diaxial $\\mathrm{H}1$-$\\mathrm{H}2$ relationship. The $\\alpha$-anomer will exhibit a small coupling constant (typically $2-4$ Hz), indicative of the equatorial-axial $\\mathrm{H}1$-$\\mathrm{H}2$ relationship.\n\nPart 2: Calculation for the $\\beta$-Anomer\nThe problem requires the calculation of the coupling constant $\\,^{3}J_{\\mathrm{H}1,\\mathrm{H}2}\\,$ for the $\\beta$-anomer using the provided Karplus equation and parameters.\n\nThe equation is:\n$$\n\\,^{3}J(\\theta) = A \\cos^{2}\\theta + B \\cos\\theta + C\n$$\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- $A = 9.5$\n- $B = -1.0$\n- $C = 0.5$\n- $\\theta = \\theta_{\\beta} = 170^{\\circ}$\n\nWe must substitute these values into the equation.

The stereocontrolled formation of the $\\beta$-mannoside linkage represents a classic and formidable challenge in carbohydrate chemistry, demanding a move beyond standard protocols [@problem_id:2568806]. This problem requires you to analyze the profound stereoelectronic obstacles to this transformation and propose a sophisticated, mechanistically-driven strategy, honing the critical thinking skills of a synthetic chemist.", "problem": "You are tasked with forming a $\\beta$-$(1 \\to 2)$-mannosidic linkage between a mannosyl donor and an acceptor in a disaccharide synthesis under conditions that strongly penalize trial-and-error. You must reason from standard stereoelectronic principles of carbohydrate chemistry, including the anomeric effect, neighboring group participation, ring conformational analysis, and the mechanistic manifolds of Substitution Nucleophilic Unimolecular (SN1) and Substitution Nucleophilic Bimolecular (SN2) processes, to justify both why the target linkage is intrinsically challenging and how to overcome this challenge using temporary protection and directing groups. Select the option that provides the most internally consistent mechanistic rationale and a practically implementable strategy that plausibly achieves high $\\beta$ selectivity for the $\\beta$-$(1 \\to 2)$-mannosidic bond when coupling a mannosyl donor to an acceptor whose only free hydroxyl is the $2$-OH (all other hydroxyls are temporarily masked).\n\nA. $\\beta$-Mannosides are difficult because the $\\beta$-$(1 \\to 2)$ linkage in D-mannose is $1,2$-cis and disfavored by the anomeric effect, and because a participating group at $2$-O on a mannosyl donor blocks the $\\beta$ face and thereby directs formation of $\\alpha$-mannosides. A viable solution is to eliminate $2$-O neighboring group participation with a nonparticipating $2$-O protecting group (e.g., benzyl) on the donor and to install a conformationally restricting $4,6$-O-benzylidene acetal on the donor to favor formation of an $\\alpha$-glycosyl triflate upon preactivation at low temperature. Subsequent Substitution Nucleophilic Bimolecular (SN2)-like attack by the acceptor (rendered regioselective by temporary protection leaving only $2$-OH free) from the backside gives the $\\beta$-mannoside. Optionally, a temporary silicon tether can be used to preorganize intramolecular delivery from the $\\alpha$ face to further enhance $\\beta$ selectivity; after glycosylation, the tether and temporary protections are removed to reveal the $\\beta$-$(1 \\to 2)$ linkage.\n\nB. $\\beta$-Mannosides are difficult primarily due to steric hindrance at $C2$. Installing a strongly participating $2$-O-acyl group on the mannosyl donor will ensure neighboring group participation, which preferentially yields $\\beta$-mannosides. To maximize reactivity, dispense with conformational control; leaving multiple hydroxyls on the acceptor unprotected increases its nucleophilicity and ensures selective reaction at $2$-OH under kinetic control.\n\nC. The challenge is that $\\beta$-mannosides are kinetically disfavored, but they are thermodynamically more stable than $\\alpha$-mannosides. Therefore, employ a per-benzylated mannosyl donor and a strong Lewis acid to generate a long-lived oxocarbenium ion at elevated temperature; allow equilibration so that the product mixture thermodynamically enriches in the $\\beta$ anomer without the need for directing groups or temporary protection beyond standard benzyl ethers.\n\nD.

It addresses a classical and significant challenge in synthetic organic chemistry—the stereoselective synthesis of $\\beta$-mannosides. The stereochemistry of D-mannose, specifically the axial orientation of the substituent at the $C2$ position in the standard ${}^{4}C_{1}$ conformation, creates a unique set of stereoelectronic hurdles that are distinct from those in the synthesis of other common glycosides, such as glucosides. The principles cited for reasoning are the correct and necessary tools for analyzing this problem. The problem statement contains no scientific or factual unsoundness, no contradictions, and is not underspecified for a conceptual analysis. The language is precise and technical.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived based on first principles, followed by a critical evaluation of each provided option.\n\n**Derivation of a Plausible Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in controlling the stereochemical outcome at the anomeric carbon ($C1$) of a mannosyl donor during glycosylation.\n\n$1$. **Stereochemical Analysis of the Target:** D-Mannose is the $C2$ epimer of D-glucose. In its thermodynamically preferred ${}^{4}C_{1}$ chair conformation, the substituent at $C2$ is in an axial position. The target linkage is $\\beta$, which corresponds to an equatorial orientation of the glycosidic bond at $C1$. Therefore, the desired $\\beta$-mannosidic linkage establishes a $1,2$-*cis* stereochemical relationship between the new bond at $C1$ and the substituent at $C2$.\n\n$2$. **Intrinsic Difficulties:**\n    a. **Neighboring Group Participation (NGP):** A standard method for achieving $1,2$-*trans* glycosidic linkages is to place a participating group (e.g., an acyl group like acetyl or benzoyl) at the $C2$ position. Upon activation of the anomeric center (e.g., departure of a leaving group), the neighboring participating group attacks the transient oxocarbenium ion to form a stable, cyclic acyl-oxonium intermediate (a dioxolanylium ion). This intermediate shields one face of the anomeric carbon, forcing the incoming nucleophile (the acceptor) to attack from the opposite face. In the case of a mannosyl donor, the $C2$-acyl group is axial. It participates from the $\\alpha$-face, forming an intermediate that blocks this face. Consequently, the nucleophile must attack from the $\\beta$-face, leading to the formation of a $1,2$-*trans* product. For mannose, this $1,2$-*trans* product is the $\\alpha$-mannoside. Thus, the use of a participating group at $C2$ leads directly to the undesired $\\alpha$-anomer. To form the desired $1,2$-*cis* $\\beta$-mannoside, **neighboring group participation from $C2$ must be rigorously suppressed.**\n    b. **The Anomeric Effect:** This stereoelectronic effect stabilizes the axial orientation of an electronegative substituent at the anomeric carbon. This means the $\\alpha$-anomer of a mannoside (axial glycosidic bond) is generally the thermodynamically more stable product. Any reaction proceeding under thermodynamic control or through an intermediate that allows for equilibration (e.g., a long-lived oxocarbenium ion) will preferentially yield the $\\alpha$-mannoside.\n    c. **Kinetic $\\alpha$-Selection:** In reactions proceeding via an $S_N1$-like mechanism through an oxocarbenium ion intermediate, kinetic attack by the nucleophile often favors the axial position to form the $\\alpha$-product (the axial attack is sterically more accessible and electronically favored by the developing anomeric effect in the transition state).\n\n$3$. **A Rational Strategy for $\\beta$-Mannosylation:**\nBased on the analysis above, a successful strategy must prevent $C2$-NGP and avoid thermodynamic equilibration or kinetic pathways that favor $\\alpha$-anomer formation. The most logical approach is to force the reaction through a pathway that kinetically favors the $\\beta$-product. This can be achieved via a direct bimolecular substitution with inversion of configuration ($S_N2$-like mechanism).\n\n    a. **Suppress NGP:** Use a non-participating protecting group at the $C2$ position. An ether-type group, such as a benzyl ether ($-OBn$), is standard for this purpose as it is electronically incapable of participation.\n    b. **Favor an $S_N2$ Pathway:** To enable an $S_N2$-like reaction, one must start with a defined configuration at the anomeric center. The strategy is to prepare an $\\alpha$-glycosyl donor, which has an axial leaving group. Attack by the nucleophile from the backside (the equatorial or $\\beta$-face) will lead to inversion, yielding the desired equatorial ($\\beta$) product.\n    c. **Generate and Trap the Key Intermediate:** A powerful implementation of this strategy involves the low-temperature pre-activation of a mannosyl donor (e.g., a thioglycoside or a glycosyl hemiacetal) with a potent electrophile (e.g., a triflic anhydride source like $Tf_2O$) to generate an $\\alpha$-glycosyl triflate *in situ*. The $\\alpha$-triflate is formed preferentially due to the anomeric effect, which stabilizes the axial triflate group. To prevent this highly reactive intermediate from dissociating to an oxocarbenium ion (the start of the undesired $S_N1$ pathway), the ring conformation is often rigidified.\n    d. **Conformational Control:** A $4,6$-O-benzylidene acetal is a classic protecting group for this purpose. It fuses a second ring system onto the pyranose, making the ${}^{4}C_{1}$ conformation more rigid and disfavoring the ring-flattening required for oxocarbenium ion formation. This rigidity kinetically favors the direct $S_N2$-like displacement on the $\\alpha$-triflate.\n    e. **Final Step:** The acceptor, with its single free $2$-OH group, attacks the pre-formed $\\alpha$-triflate intermediate, effecting an inversion of configuration to give the desired $\\beta$-mannoside with high selectivity.\n\nThis comprehensive strategy, often known as the Crich glycosylation, is the modern standard for addressing this problem. Advanced modifications, such as intramolecular delivery via temporary tethers, can further enhance selectivity by pre-organizing the donor and acceptor.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**Option A:** This option provides a complete and correct rationale. It correctly identifies the $1,2$-*cis* stereochemistry as the challenge, correctly explains that $C2$ neighboring group participation leads to undesired $\\alpha$-mannosides, and correctly states that the anomeric effect disfavors the $\\beta$-product. The proposed solution is precisely the state-of-the-art strategy derived above:\n$1$) use a non-participating $2$-O-benzyl group to prevent NGP;\n$2$) use a conformationally restricting $4,6$-O-benzylidene acetal;\n$3$) perform low-temperature pre-activation to form an $\\alpha$-glycosyl triflate;\n$4$) allow $S_N2$-like attack by the acceptor to give the $\\beta$-mannoside.\nThe optional mention of a temporary silicon tether for intramolecular delivery is also a known and valid advanced technique. A minor ambiguity exists in the phrase \"delivery from the $\\alpha$ face\", but the overall principle is sound and the core strategy is described perfectly.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B:** This option is fundamentally flawed.\n$1$) It misidentifies the primary difficulty as \"steric hindrance\", which is an oversimplification; the problem is stereoelectronic.\n$2$) It makes the critically incorrect claim that a participating $2$-O-acyl group \"preferentially yields $\\beta$-mannosides\". As established, such participation leads to the $1,2$-*trans* product, which is the $\\alpha$-mannoside. This strategy would explicitly produce the wrong anomer.\n$3$) The suggestion to dispense with conformational control and use a poly-unprotected acceptor is synthetically naive and would lead to a non-selective reaction and an unseparable mixture of regioisomers.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C:** This option is based on a false thermodynamic premise.\n$1$) It correctly states that $\\beta$-mannosides are kinetically disfavored, but then incorrectly claims they are \"thermodynamically more stable than $\\alpha$-mannosides\". Due to the anomeric effect, the $\\alpha$-anomer is generally the thermodynamic product.\n$2$) The proposed strategy of using a non-participating donor with a strong Lewis acid at high temperature to achieve equilibration would, in fact, enrich the mixture in the undesired but thermodynamically favored $\\alpha$-anomer. The strategy would achieve the opposite of the stated goal.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D:** This option begins with a factual error about the product's stereochemistry.\n$1$) It incorrectly states that the $\\beta$-$(1 \\to 2)$ bond is $\"1,2$-trans\". It is $1,2$-*cis*.\n$2$) Based on this false premise, it incorrectly suggests using a $2$-O-acetyl group for participation to give $\\beta$ selectivity. NGP gives the $1,2$-*trans* product ($\\alpha$-mannoside), not the $1,2$-*cis* product ($\\beta$-mannoside).\n$3$) The mention of a \"$3,4$-O-benzylidene acetal\" and \"frontside substitution\" is mechanistically incoherent in this context. It mixes unrelated concepts and is not a recognized strategy for this transformation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nIn summary, only Option A presents a mechanistically sound, internally consistent, and practically viable strategy for the challenging synthesis of $\\beta$-mannosides.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2568806"}]}
