We may proceed to a solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the deprotonated fraction of N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) at a specified $pH$. Let the protonated form of the anomeric carboxyl group be denoted as $HA$ and the deprotonated carboxylate form be $A^{-}$. The dissociation of this monoprotic acid in water is described by the equilibrium:\n$$\nHA \\rightleftharpoons H^{+} + A^{-}\n$$\nThe acid dissociation constant, $K_{a}$, is defined by the fundamental law of mass action for this equilibrium. Assuming activity coefficients are unity, we have:\n$$\nK_{a} = \\frac{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}{[HA]}\n$$\nwhere $[H^{+}]$, $[A^{-}]$, and $[HA]$ represent the molar concentrations of the hydronium ion, the deprotonated species, and the protonated species, respectively.\n\nWe are given the $pK_{a}$ of the carboxyl group, which is related to $K_{a}$ by the definition:\n$$\npK_{a} = -\\log_{10}(K_{a})\n$$\nSimilarly, the $pH$ of the solution is defined as:\n$$\npH = -\\log_{10}([H^{+}])\n$$\nFrom these definitions, it follows that $K_{a} = 10^{-pK_{a}}$ and $[H^{+}] = 10^{-pH}$.\n\nThe quantity to be determined is the fraction of Neu5Ac molecules in the deprotonated form, which we will denote by $\\alpha$. This fraction is defined as the concentration of the deprotonated species divided by the total concentration of Neu5Ac, $[A]_{total}$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{[A^{-}]}{[A]_{total}} = \\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA] + [A^{-}]}\n$$\nTo express $\\alpha$ in terms of the given quantities, we first rearrange the expression for $K_{a}$ to find the ratio of the concentrations of the two species:\n$$\n\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]} = \\frac{K_{a}}{[H^{+}]}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $K_{a}$ and $[H^{+}]$ in terms of $pK_{a}$ and $pH$:\n$$\n\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]} = \\frac{10^{-pK_{a}}}{10^{-pH}} = 10^{pH - pK_{a}}\n$$\nThis is the central result from which the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is derived. Now, we return to the expression for $\\alpha$ and divide both the numerator and the denominator by $[HA]$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}}{1 + \\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}}\n$$\nSubstituting the ratio we just derived:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{10^{pH - pK_{a}}}{1 + 10^{pH - pK_{a}}}\n$$\nThis expression gives the fraction of the deprotonated species as a function of the solution $pH$ and the acid's $pK_{a}$. We are given $pH = 6.5$ and $pK_{a} \\approx 2.6$. Substituting these values into the equation:\n$$\n\\Delta(pH, pK_{a}) = pH - pK_{a} = 6.5 - 2.6 = 3.9\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{10^{3.9}}{1 + 10^{3.9}}\n$$\nTo compute the numerical value:\n$$\n10^{3.9} \\approx 7943.282\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha \\approx \\frac{7943.282}{1 + 7943.282} = \\frac{7943.282}{7944.282} \\approx 0.99987413\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. Therefore, the deprotonated fraction is $0.9999$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for a justification of the electrostatic interaction between Neu5Ac and sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs). At $pH = 6.5$, our calculation shows that the deprotonated fraction $\\alpha$ is approximately $0.9999$. This means that virtually every Neu5Ac molecule ($99.99\\%$) exists in its carboxylate form, $A^{-}$, carrying a formal negative charge of $-1$. The fundamental principle of electrostatics, as described by Coulomb's Law, dictates that particles with opposite charges attract each other. The problem states that Siglec binding pockets typically present cationic (positively charged) residues, such as arginine or lysine, which are protonated and positively charged at this $pH$. The interaction between the anionic carboxylate group of Neu5Ac and the cationic residues in the Siglec binding pocket will therefore be a strong electrostatic attraction. The magnitude of this attractive force is significant because the charge on the Neu5Ac ligand is not transient or partial; it is a full, stable negative charge present on nearly all molecules in the population, making it a dominant force in the initial recognition and binding process.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.9999}\n$$", "id": "2577246"}, {"introduction": "The precise architecture of glycans is essential for their function, and this architecture is constructed one bond at a time through glycosylation reactions. A central challenge in carbohydrate chemistry is controlling the stereochemistry of the newly formed glycosidic linkage.

Understanding this principle is key to predicting the products of glycosylation reactions and appreciating the strategies used to synthesize complex oligosaccharides.", "problem": "In glycosylation reactions of amino sugars, the configuration at the anomeric center is often governed by neighboring group effects at the $C_2$ position. Consider perbenzylated donors derived from N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), where the $C_2$ substituent is either a native $2$-acetamido group or is replaced by a non-participating surrogate. Using only the following foundational principles, reason to the stereochemical outcome and then choose the statement that correctly defines participating versus non-participating protecting groups at $C_2$ and predicts their roles in controlling anomeric selectivity for GlcNAc and GalNAc donors:\n\nFundamental base:\n- Anchimeric assistance (neighboring group participation): a proximal heteroatom-bearing acyl group can intramolecularly attack a developing glycosyl oxocarbenium ion at $C_1$, forming a transient cyclic intermediate that is lower in energy than the naked cation and that reopens to the product with attack from the face opposite to the participating group, resulting in a defined relative configuration at $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n- In the absence of anchimeric assistance at $C_2$, the intermediate is best described as a glycosyl oxocarbenium ion whose capture by the nucleophile depends on steric and stereoelectronic factors (including but not limited to the anomeric effect and the approach from the less hindered face), and no intrinsic enforcement of $1,2$-trans occurs.\n- For $2$-acetamido donors, the carbonyl oxygen can deliver intramolecular assistance via a $5$-membered oxazoline or oxazolinium-type intermediate; for $2$-O-acyl donors, a $5$-membered dioxolenium-type intermediate forms.\n- In D-GlcNAc and D-GalNAc pyranoses, the $C_2$ substituent is equatorial; therefore, a $1,2$-trans relationship places the anomeric substituent axial (the $\\alpha$-anomer), whereas a $1,2$-cis relationship places the anomeric substituent equatorial (the $\\beta$-anomer).\n\nYou plan four couplings to a primary alcohol acceptor of moderate nucleophilicity under standard activation of a competent leaving group at $C_1$ (e.g., a thioglycoside or trichloroacetimidate), at low temperature in a non-nucleophilic solvent:\n- Donor $1$: perbenzylated GlcNAc with native $2$-acetamido.\n- Donor $2$: same GlcNAc skeleton, but $2$-azido instead of $2$-acetamido.\n- Donor $3$: perbenzylated GalNAc with native $2$-acetamido.\n- Donor $4$: same GalNAc skeleton, but $2$-$N$-$\\text{Cbz}$ (benzyloxycarbonyl carbamate) instead of $2$-acetamido.\n\nWhich option most accurately defines participating versus non-participating protecting groups at $C_2$ and correctly predicts the stereochemical trends for these donors?\n\nA. Participating groups at $C_2$ are those whose carbonyl oxygen can intramolecularly assist to form a $5$-membered cyclic intermediate, enforcing $1,2$-trans delivery at $C_1$. Thus, $2$-acetamido donors $1$ and $3$ are $\\alpha$-selective (via oxazolinium formation), whereas $2$-azido and $2$-N-$\\text{Cbz}$ donors $2$ and $4$ are non-participating and can give $1,2$-cis ($\\beta$) products, albeit with stereoselectivity contingent on reaction conditions and acceptor reactivity.\n\nB.

Neighboring group participation at $C_2$ of $2$-acetamido donors proceeds via a $6$-membered ring and enforces $1,2$-cis addition; hence $2$-acetamido donors $1$ and $3$ are $\\beta$-selective, but $2$-azido and $2$-N-$\\text{Cbz}$ donors $2$ and $4$ are $\\alpha$-selective because they cannot form the $6$-membered intermediate.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe givens are:\n-   **Topic**: Glycosylation reactions of amino sugars.\n-   **Donors**: Perbenzylated donors from $N$-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and $N$-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc).\n-   **$C_2$ Substituents**: Native $2$-acetamido group or a non-participating surrogate.\n-   **Fundamental Base (Principles)**:\n    1.  **Anchimeric Assistance**: A proximal heteroatom-bearing acyl group at $C_2$ intramolecularly attacks the developing glycosyl oxocarbenium ion at $C_1$, forming a transient cyclic intermediate. This intermediate reopens upon attack by an external nucleophile from the face opposite to the participating group, resulting in a defined $1,2$-trans relative configuration.\n    2.  **No Anchimeric Assistance**: The intermediate is a glycosyl oxocarbenium ion.

A $1,2$-cis relationship corresponds to an equatorial substituent at $C_1$ (the $\\beta$-anomer).\n-   **Specific Donors**:\n    -   Donor $1$: Perbenzylated GlcNAc with native $2$-acetamido group.\n    -   Donor $2$: Perbenzylated GlcNAc with $2$-azido group.\n    -   Donor $3$: Perbenzylated GalNAc with native $2$-acetamido group.\n    -   Donor $4$: Perbenzylated GalNAc with $2$-$N$-$\\text{Cbz}$ (benzyloxycarbonyl carbamate) group.\n-   **Reaction Conditions**: Coupling to a primary alcohol, standard activation of a $C_1$ leaving group, low temperature, non-nucleophilic solvent.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated for validity.\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: Yes. The principles of neighboring group participation in glycosylation chemistry are fundamental and accurately described. The formation of oxazolinium intermediates from $2$-acetamido donors, leading to $1,2$-trans products, is a classic concept in carbohydrate chemistry. The description of non-participating pathways is also correct.\n-   **Well-Posed**: Yes. The problem provides a set of axioms (\"Fundamental base\") and asks for a conclusion based on them. It is self-contained and provides sufficient information to analyze each case.\n-   **Objective**: Yes. The language is technical and free of subjectivity.\n-   **Consistency**: The givens are internally consistent. The stereochemical definitions (equatorial $C_2$ group, correlation of $1,2$-trans/cis with $\\alpha/\\beta$) are correct for D-gluco and D-galacto pyranoses in their standard ${}^{4}C_{1}$ chair conformations.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. It is **valid**. Proceeding to solution.\n\n### Derivation of Stereochemical Outcomes\n\nBased on the provided principles, we analyze the behavior of each donor. The key is to classify the $C_2$ substituent as \"participating\" or \"non-participating\".\n\nAccording to Principle $1$, a participating group must be an **acyl group** capable of intramolecular attack. Principle $3$ specifies that for a $2$-acetamido group, the carbonyl oxygen performs this attack to form a **$5$-membered ring**. This participation enforces a **$1,2$-trans** stereochemical outcome.\n\nAccording to Principle $4$, for both D-GlcNAc and D-GalNAc donors (which have an equatorial $C_2$ substituent), a $1,2$-trans relationship means the substituent at the anomeric carbon ($C_1$) must be **axial**. An axial anomeric substituent in a D-pyranose is, by definition, the **$\\alpha$-anomer**. Therefore, any participating group according to the rules will lead to the $\\alpha$-glycoside.\n\nConversely, a non-participating group (Principle $2$) does not enforce a specific outcome. The reaction proceeds through an oxocarbenium ion, and formation of the $1,2$-cis product (the **$\\beta$-anomer**) is possible and often observed, particularly under kinetically controlled conditions.\n\nNow we analyze each specific donor:\n\n1.  **Donor $1$ (GlcNAc with $2$-acetamido)** and **Donor $3$ (GalNAc with $2$-acetamido)**: The $2$-acetamido ($-\\text{NHCOCH}_3$) group is an acyl group. It perfectly matches the description of a participating group in Principles $1$ and $3$. It will form a cis-fused oxazolinium intermediate across the $C_1-C_2$ bond. Nucleophilic attack on this intermediate must occur from the face opposite to the ring structure, which is the top ($\\alpha$) face. This leads exclusively to the $1,2$-trans product. For both GlcNAc and GalNAc, this corresponds to the **$\\alpha$-anomer**. Thus, donors $1$ and $3$ are $\\alpha$-selective.\n\n2.  **Donor $2$ (GlcNAc with $2$-azido)**: The azido group ($-\\text{N}_3$) is not an acyl group. It lacks a carbonyl oxygen and cannot form the specified $5$-membered cyclic intermediate via anchimeric assistance. It is a classic **non-participating** group. The reaction proceeds via an oxocarbenium ion intermediate. As per Principle $2$, stereoselectivity is not intrinsically enforced to be $1,2$-trans. The formation of the $1,2$-cis product, the **$\\beta$-anomer**, is a likely outcome.\n\n3.  **Donor $4$ (GalNAc with $2$-$N$-$\\text{Cbz}$)**: The $N$-benzyloxycarbonyl group ($-\\text{NHCOOCH}_2\\text{Ph}$) is a carbamate. It contains a carbonyl group. Mechanistically, it *can* participate similarly to an acetamido group. However, in synthetic practice, carbamates like Cbz are often considered \"weakly participating\" or are sometimes grouped with non-participating groups because their participation can be less reliable than that of amides, potentially allowing for competitive non-participating pathways. The question requires choosing the *most accurate* option, which involves interpreting how these groups are categorized within the problem's context.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nWe now evaluate each option against this derivation.\n\n**A. Participating groups at $C_2$ are those whose carbonyl oxygen can intramolecularly assist to form a $5$-membered cyclic intermediate, enforcing $1,2$-trans delivery at $C_1$. Thus, $2$-acetamido donors $1$ and $3$ are $\\alpha$-selective (via oxazolinium formation), whereas $2$-azido and $2$-N-$\\text{Cbz}$ donors $2$ and $4$ are non-participating and can give $1,2$-cis ($\\beta$) products, albeit with stereoselectivity contingent on reaction conditions and acceptor reactivity.**\n\n-   **Definition of Participation**: Correct. Matches Principles $1$ and $3$.\n-   **Prediction for Donors $1$ and $3$**: Correct. As derived, the $2$-acetamido group is participating and leads to $\\alpha$-selectivity ($1,2$-trans).\n-   **Classification of Donors $2$ and $4$**: It classifies both azido and Cbz as non-participating. This is correct for azido. The classification of Cbz as non-participating is a reasonable simplification in this context, contrasting it with the strongly participating acetamido group.\n-   **Prediction for Donors $2$ and $4$**: Correct. Non-participating pathways do not enforce $1,2$-trans selectivity and can lead to $1,2$-cis ($\\beta$) products. The caveat about dependence on conditions is also correct.\n-   **Verdict**: This option provides an accurate definition of participation and makes predictions that are consistent with the \"Fundamental base\" and common chemical understanding. The classification of Cbz as non-participating is the most logical choice in this multiple-choice format, as all other options contain fundamental errors. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Participating groups at $C_2$ are those that withdraw electron density and suppress cation formation; they bias $1,2$-cis addition. Thus, $2$-acetamido donors $1$ and $3$ are $\\beta$-selective, while $2$-azido and $2$-N-$\\text{Cbz}$ donors $2$ and $4$ are $\\alpha$-selective.**\n\n-   **Definition of Participation**: Incorrect. The entire premise is flawed. Participation *stabilizes* the cation through a cyclic intermediate and enforces **$1,2$-trans** addition, not $1,2$-cis.\n-   **Predictions**: The predictions are inverted and based on a false premise.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Both participating and non-participating $C_2$ groups lead to the same selectivity, which is governed solely by the anomeric effect. Therefore, donors $1$–$4$ all give the $\\beta$-anomer as the major product for both GlcNAc and GalNAc.**\n\n-   **Premise**: Incorrect. This statement directly contradicts Principle $1$, which states that anchimeric assistance leads to a defined ($1,2$-trans) stereochemical outcome, overriding other effects. The anomeric effect is a key factor only in the *absence* of participation.\n-   **Predictions**: The prediction that participating donors $1$ and $3$ give the $\\beta$-anomer is incorrect.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Neighboring group participation at $C_2$ of $2$-acetamido donors proceeds via a $6$-membered ring and enforces $1,2$-cis addition; hence $2$-acetamido donors $1$ and $3$ are $\\beta$-selective, but $2$-azido and $2$-N-$\\text{Cbz}$ donors $2$ and $4$ are $\\alpha$-selective because they cannot form the $6$-membered intermediate.**\n\n-   **Mechanism**: Incorrect. Principle $3$ explicitly states a **$5$-membered** ring intermediate. The premise of a $6$-membered ring is false.\n-   **Stereochemical Consequence**: Incorrect. Principle $1$ states participation enforces **$1,2$-trans** addition, not $1,2$-cis.\n-   **Predictions**: All predictions are based on two fundamental errors in the premise.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, Option A is the only one that correctly applies the provided fundamental principles of glycosylation chemistry.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2577256"}, {"introduction": "To understand the roles of modified monosaccharides in a cellular context, we must examine how they are synthesized and regulated within metabolic networks.

The problem provides the distribution for the acetyl group: doubly labeled ($^{13}\\!C_2$), singly labeled ($^{13}\\!C_1$), or unlabeled ($^{12}\\!C_2$). Therefore, the contribution from acetyl-CoA, $k_{\\text{AcCoA}}$, can be $2$, $1$, or $0$.\n\nThe distribution of isotopomers of GlcNAc is a direct consequence of the combinatorial assembly from these stochastically labeled precursor pools.\n\nTask 2: Identification of conditions for a GlcNAc moiety to be $M+9$.\nThe target isotopomer is $M+9$, which means the total number of heavy isotopes must be $k=9$. We must find the integer-valued contributions from each precursor that sum to $9$:\n$$k_{\\text{Glc}} + k_{\\text{Gln}} + k_{\\text{AcCoA}} = 9$$\nWe analyze the possible values for each term based on the biochemistry established in Task 1:\n- $k_{\\text{Glc}} \\in \\{0, 6\\}$\n- $k_{\\text{Gln}} \\in \\{0, 1\\}$\n- $k_{\\text{AcCoA}} \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$\n\nThe maximum possible value for $k$ is the sum of the maximum contributions from each precursor: $k_{\\text{max}} = 6 (\\text{from glucose}) + 1 (\\text{from glutamine}) + 2 (\\text{from acetyl-CoA}) = 9$.\nFor the sum $k_{\\text{Glc}} + k_{\\text{Gln}} + k_{\\text{AcCoA}}$ to equal $9$, each term must take its maximum possible value. Any other combination would result in a sum less than $9$.\nTherefore, the necessary and sufficient conditions for a GlcNAc moiety to be an $M+9$ isotopomer are:\n1.  It must be synthesized from a fully labeled $^{13}\\!C_{6}$-fructose-$6$-phosphate molecule ($k_{\\text{Glc}} = 6$).\n2.  The nitrogen must come from a $^{15}\\!N$-labeled glutamine molecule ($k_{\\text{Gln}} = 1$).\n3.  The acetyl group must be sourced from a doubly labeled $^{13}\\!C_{2}$-acetyl-CoA molecule ($k_{\\text{AcCoA}} = 2$).\n\nTask 3: Computation of the predicted mole fraction of the $M+9$ isotopomer.\nThe problem states that the precursor pools are statistically independent. Therefore, the probability (mole fraction) of forming a specific isotopomer of GlcNAc is the product of the probabilities (mole fractions) of the specific precursor isotopomers required for its synthesis.\nLet $P(M+9)$ be the mole fraction of the $M+9$ isotopomer of the GlcNAc moiety. Based on the conditions identified in Task 2, we have:\n$$P(M+9) = P(k_{\\text{Glc}}=6) \\times P(k_{\\text{Gln}}=1) \\times P(k_{\\text{AcCoA}}=2)$$\nWe are given the mole fractions for each of these events:\n- The mole fraction of $^{13}\\!C_{6}$ fructose-$6$-phosphate is $P(k_{\\text{Glc}}=6) = 0.76$.\n- The mole fraction of $^{15}\\!N$ glutamine amide is $P(k_{\\text{Gln}}=1) = 0.92$.\n- The mole fraction of $^{13}\\!C_{2}$-acetyl-CoA is $P(k_{\\text{AcCoA}}=2) = 0.48$.\n\nNow, we compute the product:\n$$P(M+9) = 0.76 \\times 0.92 \\times 0.48$$\n$$P(M+9) = 0.6992 \\times 0.48$$\n$$P(M+9) = 0.335616$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P(M+9) \\approx 0.3356$$\nThis is the predicted mole fraction of the $M+9$ isotopomer of the GlcNAc moiety.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.3356}\n$$", "id": "2577264"}]}
