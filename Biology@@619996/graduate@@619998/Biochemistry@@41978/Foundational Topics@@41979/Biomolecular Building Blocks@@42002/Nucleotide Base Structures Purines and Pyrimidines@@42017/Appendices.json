For the given two-state system (`anti` and `syn`), the partition function is:\n$$ Q = g_{\\text{anti}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{G_{\\text{anti}}}{RT}\\right) + g_{\\text{syn}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{G_{\\text{syn}}}{RT}\\right) $$\nThe problem states that we assume equal degeneracy, which means $g_{\\text{anti}} = g_{\\text{syn}}$. We can set this common degeneracy factor to $1$ without loss of generality, as it will cancel from the final fraction. Thus, the partition function simplifies to:\n$$ Q = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{G_{\\text{anti}}}{RT}\\right) + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{G_{\\text{syn}}}{RT}\\right) $$\nThe equilibrium fraction of molecules in a specific conformation, for example the `syn` state, is the probability $f_{\\text{syn}}$ of finding a molecule in that state.

The problem is well-posed, asking for a rationalization of relative basicity based on structure, a classic exercise in applying electronic effects. The language is precise and objective.

There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors in the problem setup.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe task is to determine the relative basicity of the nitrogen atoms in adenine. According to principle (i), basicity is directly related to the stability of the corresponding conjugate acid. We must therefore analyze the stability of the species formed upon protonation at each potential site.\n\n1.  **Identification of Basic Sites:**\n    The problem states that $\\mathrm{N}1$, $\\mathrm{N}3$, and $\\mathrm{N}7$ are pyridine-like, meaning their lone pairs reside in $sp^2$ orbitals within the plane of the aromatic ring and are not part of the $\\pi$ system. Protonation at these sites does not disrupt the aromaticity of the purine system. In contrast, $\\mathrm{N}9$ is described as pyrrole-like, meaning its lone pair is part of the aromatic $\\pi$ system. Protonation at $\\mathrm{N}9$ would require these electrons to form a $\\sigma$ bond to a proton, thereby destroying the aromatic character of the ring system. This carries a significant energetic penalty. According to principle (ii), pyrrole-like nitrogens are vastly less basic than pyridine-like nitrogens. Therefore, $\\mathrm{N}9$ is not a significantly populated monoprotonation site in dilute aqueous solution. The candidate sites for monoprotonation are $\\mathrm{N}1$, $\\mathrm{N}3$, and $\\mathrm{N}7$.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Conjugate Acid Stabilities:**\n    We compare the stability of the conjugate acids formed by protonating $\\mathrm{N}1$, $\\mathrm{N}3$, and $\\mathrm{N}7$.\n\n    -   **Protonation at $\\mathrm{N}1$**: Upon protonation, a positive charge is localized on $\\mathrm{N}1$. The adenine molecule has an exocyclic amino group ($-\\mathrm{NH}_2$) at the $\\mathrm{C}6$ position, which is adjacent to $\\mathrm{N}1$. The amino group is a powerful electron-donating group via resonance (a $+\\mathrm{R}$ or $+\\mathrm{M}$ effect). The lone pair of the exocyclic nitrogen can be delocalized into the ring system to stabilize the positive charge at $\\mathrm{N}1$. This creates a resonance structure where the positive charge is shared with the exocyclic nitrogen, forming a stable cation with partial guanidinium character ($-\\mathrm{N}=\\mathrm{C}(\\mathrm{NH}_2)-\\mathrm{N}^{+}- \\leftrightarrow -\\mathrm{N}^{+}-\\mathrm{C}(\\mathrm{NH}_2)=\\mathrm{N}-$). This strong resonance stabilization makes the $\\mathrm{N}1$-protonated conjugate acid particularly stable.\n\n    -   **Protonation at $\\mathrm{N}3$**: $\\mathrm{N}3$ is located on the pyrimidine ring. When protonated, the positive charge on $\\mathrm{N}3$ is not favorably positioned for resonance stabilization by the $\\mathrm{C}6-\\mathrm{NH}_2$ group, as the delocalization pathway is long and ineffective ($\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{N}-\\mathrm{C}6-\\mathrm{C}5-\\mathrm{C}4-\\mathrm{N}3$). Furthermore, according to principle (iv), $\\mathrm{N}3$ experiences an unfavorable electrostatic and inductive environment. It is situated between the electronegative $\\mathrm{N}1$ atom and is in proximity to the $\\mathrm{N}9$ atom of the imidazole ring. These neighboring nitrogen atoms exert an electron-withdrawing inductive effect ($-\\mathrm{I}$ effect), which destabilizes the positive charge of the protonated $\\mathrm{N}3$.\n\n    -   **Protonation at $\\mathrm{N}7$**: $\\mathrm{N}7$ belongs to the five-membered imidazole ring. The imidazole ring is generally more electron-rich than the pyrimidine ring. However, like $\\mathrm{N}3$, $\\mathrm{N}7$ is too far from the $\\mathrm{C}6-\\mathrm{NH}_2$ group for effective resonance stabilization. While the positive charge on the $\\mathrm{N}7$-protonated species can be delocalized within the imidazole ring, it lacks the potent stabilization afforded to the $\\mathrm{N}1$-protonated species by the exocyclic amino group. Therefore, the $\\mathrm{N}7$ conjugate acid is less stable than the $\\mathrm{N}1$ conjugate acid. Comparing $\\mathrm{N}7$ and $\\mathrm{N}3$, $\\mathrm{N}7$ is in a more electron-rich ring and is less affected by the inductive withdrawal that destabilizes $\\mathrm{N}3$. Thus, the $\\mathrm{N}7$-protonated species is more stable than the $\\mathrm{N}3$-protonated species.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on Relative Basicity:**\n    Based on the stability of the conjugate acids (principle i), we have the stability order: (protonated $\\mathrm{N}1$) $>$ (protonated $\\mathrm{N}7$) $>$ (protonated $\\mathrm{N}3$). This directly translates to the basicity order: $\\mathrm{N}1 > \\mathrm{N}7 > \\mathrm{N}3$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA.

The justification for each part of the ordering is consistent with the principles of resonance and inductive effects as derived above. The high basicity of $\\mathrm{N}1$ is correctly attributed to resonance stabilization by the $\\mathrm{C}6-\\mathrm{NH}_2$ group. The lower basicities of $\\mathrm{N}7$ and $\\mathrm{N}3$ are also explained correctly.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. The accessible monoprotonation microstates involve protonation at $\\mathrm{N}1$, $\\mathrm{N}3$, and $\\mathrm{N}7$. Their relative basicities are $\\mathrm{N}7 > \\mathrm{N}1 > \\mathrm{N}3$ because the imidazole-like site $\\mathrm{N}7$ is always the most basic in purines; moreover, the $\\text{C6-NH}_2$ group inductively deactivates $\\mathrm{N}1$ more than $\\mathrm{N}7$.\n-   The order of basicity $\\mathrm{N}7 > \\mathrm{N}1$ is incorrect. The reasoning is flawed. The statement that $\\mathrm{N}7$ is \"always\" the most basic in purines is a false generalization; basicity is substituent-dependent. The claim that the $-\\mathrm{NH}_2$ group \"inductively deactivates\" $\\mathrm{N}1$ misrepresents the electronic effects; the resonance-donating effect ($+\\mathrm{R}$) of the amino group is dominant and strongly *activates* $\\mathrm{N}1$ toward protonation, overwhelming its weaker inductive-withdrawing ($-\\mathrm{I}$) effect.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. Only $\\mathrm{N}1$ and $\\mathrm{N}7$ are protonatable; $\\mathrm{N}3$ is nonbasic due to pyrrolic character, and the order is $\\mathrm{N}7 > \\mathrm{N}1$ because the fused imidazole ring stabilizes the $\\mathrm{N}7$ conjugate acid by aromaticity preservation.\n-   This option makes several errors. First, it incorrectly claims $\\mathrm{N}3$ is \"nonbasic\" and has \"pyrrolic character,\" which contradicts the problem statement that $\\mathrm{N}3$ is pyridine-like and ignores that it is indeed a basic site, albeit a weak one. Second, the basicity order $\\mathrm{N}7 > \\mathrm{N}1$ is incorrect. Third, the reasoning about \"aromaticity preservation\" is not a distinguishing factor, as protonation at any of the pyridine-like sites ($\\mathrm{N}1$, $\\mathrm{N}3$, $\\mathrm{N}7$) preserves the ring's aromaticity.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. The accessible monoprotonation microstates involve protonation at $\\mathrm{N}1$, $\\mathrm{N}3$, and $\\mathrm{N}7$. The relative basicities are $\\mathrm{N}7 \\approx \\mathrm{N}1 > \\mathrm{N}3$ because both $\\mathrm{N}1$ and $\\mathrm{N}7$ are equally pyridine-like and solvation equalizes their conjugate-acid stabilities, leaving $\\mathrm{N}3$ least basic.\n-   The claim that $\\mathrm{N}7 \\approx \\mathrm{N}1$ is incorrect. There is a significant difference in their basicity due to electronic effects, with $\\mathrm{N}1$ being substantially more basic (experimental pKa for $\\mathrm{N}1$ is $\\sim 4.2$, while for $\\mathrm{N}7$ it is estimated to be $\\sim 2.5$). The reasoning that they are \"equally pyridine-like\" is an oversimplification that ignores their distinct chemical environments. The appeal to \"solvation\" is a weak argument that attempts to dismiss the clear and dominant intramolecular resonance effects that differentiate the sites.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nFinal conclusion is that option A provides the correct set of sites, the correct order of basicity, and the correct and complete justification based on the provided chemical principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2583189"}]}
