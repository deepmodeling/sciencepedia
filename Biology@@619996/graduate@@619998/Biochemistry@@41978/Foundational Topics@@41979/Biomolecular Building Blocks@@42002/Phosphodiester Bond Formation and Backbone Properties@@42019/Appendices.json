It is a standard, solvable problem in physical biochemistry. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and calculation of two quantities: the dimensionless line-charge coupling parameter, $\\xi$, and the fraction of backbone charge neutralized by condensed counterions, $f_{\\text{neutralized}}$.\n\nFirst, we construct the parameter $\\xi$. The problem states we must use the definition of the Bjerrum length, $l_B$, and the linear charge density. The Bjerrum length is defined as the distance at which the electrostatic potential energy between two elementary charges, $e$, is equal to the thermal energy, $k_B T$. In a medium with dielectric constant $\\epsilon_r$, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{e^2}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 \\epsilon_r l_B} = k_B T\n$$\nRearranging for $l_B$ gives its formal definition:\n$$\nl_B = \\frac{e^2}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 \\epsilon_r k_B T}\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.\n\nThe polyelectrolyte is modeled as a line of charges with magnitude $e$ separated by an axial distance $b$. The magnitude of the linear charge density, $\\lambda$, is the charge per unit length:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{e}{b}\n$$\nThe dimensionless coupling parameter, $\\xi$, traditionally known as the Manning parameter, quantifies the strength of the electrostatic interaction relative to the thermal energy. It is defined as the ratio of the Bjerrum length to the charge spacing distance. This ratio compares the characteristic length scale of electrostatic interactions ($l_B$) to the characteristic length scale of the charge distribution on the polymer ($b$).\n$$\n\\xi = \\frac{l_B}{b}\n$$\nThis definition is consistent with a first-principles derivation. The ratio of the electrostatic energy of two adjacent charges on the polymer backbone (separated by $b$) to the thermal energy is:\n$$\n\\frac{U_{\\text{elec}}}{E_{\\text{therm}}} = \\frac{e^2 / (4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 \\epsilon_r b)}{k_B T} = \\left(\\frac{e^2}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 \\epsilon_r k_B T}\\right) \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{l_B}{b}\n$$\nThus, $\\xi = \\frac{l_B}{b}$ is the correct dimensionless parameter.\n\nUsing the provided numerical values, $l_B \\approx 0.70 \\text{ nm}$ and $b = 0.17 \\text{ nm}$ (the effective axial spacing for DNA with two charges per $0.34 \\text{ nm}$ base pair step):\n$$\n\\xi = \\frac{0.70}{0.17} \\approx 4.1176...\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, we get $\\xi \\approx 4.12$.\n\nSecond, we derive the fraction of neutralized charge, $f_{\\text{neutralized}}$. The core prediction of counterion condensation theory is that if $\\xi > 1$ for monovalent counterions, a sufficient number of counterions will \"condense\" onto the polyelectrolyte backbone to reduce the effective coupling parameter to a critical value of unity.\nOur calculated $\\xi \\approx 4.12$, which is greater than $1$, so condensation occurs.\n\nLet $\\theta$ be the fraction of the original charge that remains un-neutralized after condensation. The fraction of charge that is neutralized is $f_{\\text{neutralized}} = 1 - \\theta$.\nThe condensation of counterions does not change the Bjerrum length $l_B$, but it increases the effective spacing between un-neutralized charges. If the original charge spacing is $b$, the effective spacing between the remaining $\\theta$ fraction of charges becomes $b_{\\text{eff}} = b / \\theta$.\n\nThe effective coupling parameter, $\\xi_{\\text{eff}}$, is calculated using this effective charge spacing:\n$$\n\\xi_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{l_B}{b_{\\text{eff}}} = \\frac{l_B}{b/\\theta} = \\theta \\frac{l_B}{b} = \\theta \\xi\n$$\nAccording to the condensation hypothesis, this effective parameter is reduced to unity:\n$$\n\\xi_{\\text{eff}} = 1\n$$\nTherefore, we have the condition:\n$$\n\\theta \\xi = 1\n$$\nSolving for the un-neutralized fraction $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\xi}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the neutralized fraction, $f_{\\text{neutralized}}$:\n$$\nf_{\\text{neutralized}} = 1 - \\theta = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\xi}\n$$\nSubstituting the values of $b$ and $l_B$:\n$$\nf_{\\text{neutralized}} = 1 - \\frac{b}{l_B}\n$$\nUsing the provided numerical values:\n$$\nf_{\\text{neutralized}} = 1 - \\frac{0.17}{0.70} = 1 - 0.242857... \\approx 0.757142...\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $f_{\\text{neutralized}} \\approx 0.757$.\n\nThe final answer is the two-component row matrix containing the calculated values for $\\xi$ and $f_{\\text{neutralized}}$, both rounded to three significant figures.\n$\\xi \\approx 4.12$\n$f_{\\text{neutralized}} \\approx 0.757$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 4.12 & 0.757 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2585809"}, {"introduction": "Enzymes that process nucleic acids must manage the negative charge of the phosphodiester backbone, and catalytic metal ions are often essential for this role.

The thio-effect is defined as the fold-decrease in $k_{\\text{obs}}$ upon sulfur substitution.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It utilizes established principles (HSAB theory) and experimental techniques (metal rescue with phosphorothioates) that are fundamental to the study of metalloenzymes. The provided data are self-contained and consistent, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by applying the HSAB principle to the kinetic data. A catalytic metal ion must form a coordinate bond to the substrate to facilitate the chemical reaction. If this coordination is critical for catalysis, replacing the ligating atom with another that has a poor affinity for the metal ion will severely diminish the reaction rate.\nAccording to HSAB theory, the hard acid $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ forms a strong coordinate bond with a hard base like a phosphate oxygen atom. It has a very poor affinity for a soft base like a thiophosphate sulfur atom. Conversely, the borderline acid $\\text{Mn}^{2+}$ has a greater affinity for sulfur than $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ does, making it a suitable \"rescue\" ion.\n\nLet us analyze the effect of phosphorothioate substitution at each stereochemical position.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the pro-Rp position:**\n    When the pro-Rp oxygen is replaced by sulfur, the observed rate constant in the presence of $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ decreases dramatically. We calculate the rate ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{k_{\\text{obs,O,Mg}}}{k_{\\text{obs,Rp,Mg}}} = \\frac{0.120\\ \\text{s}^{-1}}{0.00120\\ \\text{s}^{-1}} = 100 $$\n    This $100$-fold decrease in rate, known as a large \"thio-effect,\" indicates a severe disruption of catalysis. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the hard acid $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ is unable to coordinate effectively to the soft sulfur atom substituted at a critical binding position.\n\n    Now, we examine the same substitution in the presence of $\\text{Mn}^{2+}$. The rate ratio is:\n    $$ \\frac{k_{\\text{obs,O,Mn}}}{k_{\\text{obs,Rp,Mn}}} = \\frac{0.150\\ \\text{s}^{-1}}{0.0900\\ \\text{s}^{-1}} \\approx 1.67 $$\n    The rate decreases by a factor of less than $2$. The softer $\\text{Mn}^{2+}$ ion can ligate the sulfur atom much more effectively than $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$, thereby \"rescuing\" the catalytic activity. The combination of a large thio-effect in $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ and a small effect (successful rescue) in $\\text{Mn}^{2+}$ is the definitive signature of direct metal ion coordination at the site of substitution.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the pro-Sp position:**\n    When the pro-Sp oxygen is replaced by sulfur, the rate change in the presence of $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ is small:\n    $$ \\frac{k_{\\text{obs,O,Mg}}}{k_{\\text{obs,Sp,Mg}}} = \\frac{0.120\\ \\text{s}^{-1}}{0.0800\\ \\text{s}^{-1}} = 1.5 $$\n    This minor perturbation, a $1.5$-fold decrease, suggests that this position is not a direct ligand for the catalytic $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ ion. The small rate change is a minor electronic or steric effect, not the disruption of a critical metal-ligand bond.\n\n    In the presence of $\\text{Mn}^{2+}$, the effect is similarly small:\n    $$ \\frac{k_{\\text{obs,O,Mn}}}{k_{\\text{obs,Sp,Mn}}} = \\frac{0.150\\ \\text{s}^{-1}}{0.0700\\ \\text{s}^{-1}} \\approx 2.14 $$\n    The absence of a large thio-effect for the Sp-substitution with either metal ion confirms that the pro-Sp oxygen is not the metal coordination site.\n\nBased on this rigorous comparison, the catalytic metal ion directly ligates the **pro-Rp** nonbridging oxygen atom.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires the calculation of the thio-effect in $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ for this implicated stereochemical position. The implicated position is pro-Rp. The thio-effect is defined as the fold-decrease in $k_{\\text{obs}}$. Using the data for $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$, we have already computed this value.\nLet $\\Theta_{\\text{Rp,Mg}}$ denote the thio-effect for the Rp-position in $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$.\n$$ \\Theta_{\\text{Rp,Mg}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{obs,O,Mg}}}{k_{\\text{obs,Rp,Mg}}} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\Theta_{\\text{Rp,Mg}} = \\frac{0.120}{0.00120} = 100 $$\nThe input values, $0.120$ and $0.00120$, are given to three significant figures.

The problem is a valid application of fundamental principles to a biochemical system.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation and Calculation**\n\nThe error frequency, which we denote as $f_{error}$, arises from the incorporation of a mismatched nucleotide. The problem states that this process is preceded by a rapid equilibrium between the correctly paired state, $C$, and the mismatched state, $M$. The relative populations of these two states are governed by the Boltzmann distribution. Let $P_C$ and $P_M$ be the probabilities of the polymerase-dNTP complex being in the correct and mismatched states, respectively. Their ratio is determined by the difference in their Gibbs free energies, $G_C$ and $G_M$.\n\nThe free energy penalty for the mismatch is defined as $\\Delta G_{penalty} = G_M - G_C$. The ratio of probabilities is then:\n$$ \\frac{P_M}{P_C} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{G_M - G_C}{R T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{penalty}}{R T}\\right) $$\nThe problem posits that the error frequency is proportional to the relative flux of misincorporation, which in this model is proportional to the equilibrium population of the mismatched state relative to the correct state. We can thus write:\n$$ f_{error} = k \\cdot \\frac{P_M}{P_C} $$\nwhere $k$ is a proportionality constant that encompasses the pre-exponential kinetic factors for the subsequent chemical step.\n\nLet us denote the wild-type polymerase quantities with the subscript $WT$ and the mutant quantities with $MUT$. The error frequency for the wild-type enzyme is:\n$$ f_{WT} = k \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{penalty, WT}}{R T}\\right) $$\nThe mutation alters the free energy penalty. The problem states this penalty is *reduced* by $2\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. Let $\\delta G$ represent this change.\n$$ \\delta G = \\Delta G_{penalty, MUT} - \\Delta G_{penalty, WT} = -2\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} $$\nThe problem explicitly states that the pre-exponential kinetic factors are unchanged, which means the proportionality constant $k$ is identical for both the wild-type and mutant enzymes. The error frequency for the mutant enzyme is therefore:\n$$ f_{MUT} = k \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{penalty, MUT}}{R T}\\right) = k \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{penalty, WT} + \\delta G}{R T}\\right) $$\nThe required quantity is the fold-change in error frequency, which is the ratio $\\frac{f_{MUT}}{f_{WT}}$.\n$$ \\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{f_{MUT}}{f_{WT}} = \\frac{k \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{penalty, MUT}}{R T}\\right)}{k \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{penalty, WT}}{R T}\\right)} $$\nThe constant $k$ cancels out. Using the properties of exponential functions, we combine the terms:\n$$ \\text{Fold-change} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{penalty, MUT}}{R T} + \\frac{\\Delta G_{penalty, WT}}{R T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{penalty, MUT} - \\Delta G_{penalty, WT}}{R T}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\delta G$:\n$$ \\text{Fold-change} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta G}{R T}\\right) $$\nThis expression provides the general relationship between a change in the free energy penalty and the resulting fold-change in error frequency. Now, we substitute the given numerical values. It is imperative to maintain consistent units.
