It provides a complete and unambiguous description of an aldohexose stereoisomer and asks for the determination of its stereochemistry and a corresponding numerical encoding based on established principles of organic chemistry. The problem is therefore valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem describes an open-chain aldohexose. We will first construct its Fischer projection. The carbon chain is numbered from $C_1$ to $C_6$ from top to bottom. $C_1$ is an aldehyde group ($-\\mathrm{CHO}$), and $C_6$ is a primary alcohol group ($-\\mathrm{CH_2OH}$). The stereocenters are $C_2$, $C_3$, $C_4$, and $C_5$.

For a Fischer projection, horizontal bonds project toward the observer, and vertical bonds project away. If the lowest-priority substituent is on a horizontal bond, the stereochemical assignment determined from the remaining three groups must be inverted.\n\n**Analysis of Stereocenter $C_2$:**\nThe four substituents attached to $C_2$ are: $-\\mathrm{OH}$, $-\\mathrm{H}$, $-\\mathrm{CHO}$ (the $C_1$ group), and the rest of the chain below (the $-C_3...C_6$ group).\n1.  **Assign priorities**:\n    - Priority is assigned based on the atomic number ($Z$) of the atom directly bonded to the stereocenter.\n    - Oxygen ($Z=8$) in $-\\mathrm{OH}$ has higher priority than carbon ($Z=6$) or hydrogen ($Z=1$). Thus, $-\\mathrm{OH}$ is priority $1$.\n    - Hydrogen ($Z=1$) has the lowest priority. Thus, $-\\mathrm{H}$ is priority $4$.\n    - We must compare the $-\\mathrm{CHO}$ group and the $-C_3...$ group. Both are attached via a carbon atom. We proceed to the atoms attached to these carbons.\n    - For $-\\mathrm{CHO}$ ($C_1$), the carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen and single-bonded to a hydrogen. By the duplication rule, we treat $C_1$ as being bonded to $(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{H})$.\n    - For the $-C_3...$ group, the carbon $C_3$ is bonded to an oxygen, a carbon ($C_4$), and a hydrogen. We list these as $(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{H})$.\n    - Comparing the lists $(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{H})$ and $(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{H})$ in descending order of atomic numbers, the first point of difference is the second atom: $\\mathrm{O}$ vs $\\mathrm{C}$. Since $Z(\\mathrm{O}) > Z(\\mathrm{C})$, the $-\\mathrm{CHO}$ group has higher priority.\n    - The priorities at $C_2$ are: ($1$) $-\\mathrm{OH}$, ($2$) $-\\mathrm{CHO}$, ($3$) $-C_3(\\mathrm{OH})C_4...$, ($4$) $-\\mathrm{H}$.\n2.  **Determine configuration**:\n    - The lowest-priority group, $-\\mathrm{H}$, is on a horizontal bond.\n    - Viewing the remaining groups, the sequence $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ runs from $-\\mathrm{OH}$ (right) to $-\\mathrm{CHO}$ (top) to the lower chain (bottom). This path traces a counter-clockwise direction.\n    - Because the lowest-priority group is on a horizontal bond, we must invert the result. An $S$ configuration (counter-clockwise) becomes an $R$ configuration.\n    - The configuration at $C_2$ is $R$. Therefore, $b_2 = 1$.\n\n**Analysis of Stereocenter $C_3$:**\nThe four substituents on $C_3$ are: $-\\mathrm{OH}$, $-\\mathrm{H}$, the upper chain ($-C_2(\\mathrm{OH})\\mathrm{CHO}$), and the lower chain ($-C_4(\\mathrm{OH})C_5...$).\n1.  **Assign priorities**:\n    - As before, $-\\mathrm{OH}$ is priority $1$, and $-\\mathrm{H}$ is priority $4$.\n    - We compare the upper chain ($C_2$) and lower chain ($C_4$). Both are carbons bonded to $(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{H})$. We must look further.\n    - Upper chain: from $C_3$ to $C_2$, then to $C_1$. At $C_2$, the attached atoms are $(\\mathrm{O}, C_1, \\mathrm{H})$. The carbon $C_1$ is equivalent to $(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{H})$.\n    - Lower chain: from $C_3$ to $C_4$, then to $C_5$. At $C_4$, the attached atoms are $(\\mathrm{O}, C_5, \\mathrm{H})$. The carbon $C_5$ is attached to $(\\mathrm{O}, C_6, \\mathrm{H})$, where $C_6$ is $(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{H})$.\n    - The decisive comparison is between the branches starting at $C_2$ and $C_4$. The branch at $C_2$ leads to a $-\\mathrm{CHO}$ group, while the branch at $C_4$ leads to a $-\\mathrm{CH}(\\mathrm{OH})\\mathrm{CH_2OH}$ fragment. The $-\\mathrm{CHO}$ group ($(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{H})$ at $C_1$) outranks the $-\\mathrm{CH}(\\mathrm{OH})-$ fragment ($(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{H})$ at $C_5$).\n    - Therefore, the upper chain has higher priority.\n    - The priorities at $C_3$ are: ($1$) $-\\mathrm{OH}$, ($2$) $-C_2(\\mathrm{OH})\\mathrm{CHO}$, ($3$) $-C_4(\\mathrm{OH})C_5... $, ($4$) $-\\mathrm{H}$.\n2.  **Determine configuration**:\n    - The lowest-priority group, $-\\mathrm{H}$, is on a horizontal bond.\n    - The sequence $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ runs from $-\\mathrm{OH}$ (left) to the upper chain (top) to the lower chain (bottom). This path traces a clockwise direction.\n    - Because the lowest-priority group is on a horizontal bond, we invert the result. An $R$ configuration (clockwise) becomes an $S$ configuration.\n    - The configuration at $C_3$ is $S$. Therefore, $b_3 = 0$.\n\n**Analysis of Stereocenter $C_4$:**\nThe four substituents on $C_4$ are: $-\\mathrm{OH}$, $-\\mathrm{H}$, the upper chain ($-C_3...C_1$), and the lower chain ($-C_5(\\mathrm{OH})\\mathrm{CH_2OH}$).\n1.  **Assign priorities**:\n    - $-\\mathrm{OH}$ is priority $1$; $-\\mathrm{H}$ is priority $4$.\n    - We compare the upper chain (attached at $C_3$) and the lower chain (attached at $C_5$).\n    - The upper chain at $C_3$ is attached to $(\\mathrm{O}, C_2, \\mathrm{H})$. The carbon $C_2$ is part of a larger chain leading to a $-\\mathrm{CHO}$ group.\n    - The lower chain at $C_5$ is attached to $(\\mathrm{O}, C_6, \\mathrm{H})$. The carbon $C_6$ is a $-\\mathrm{CH_2OH}$ group, bonded to $(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{H})$.\n    - Comparing the next carbon in each chain, $C_2$ vs $C_6$. $C_2$ is bonded to $(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{H})$, whereas $C_6$ is bonded to $(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{H})$. The presence of a C-C bond in the upper chain versus only C-H bonds at $C_6$ gives the upper chain higher priority.\n    - The priorities at $C_4$ are: ($1$) $-\\mathrm{OH}$, ($2$) $-C_3...C_1$, ($3$) $-C_5...C_6$, ($4$) $-\\mathrm{H}$.\n2.  **Determine configuration**:\n    - The lowest-priority group, $-\\mathrm{H}$, is on a horizontal bond.\n    - The sequence $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ runs from $-\\mathrm{OH}$ (right) to the upper chain (top) to the lower chain (bottom). This path traces a counter-clockwise direction.\n    - Inverting due to the horizontal position of group $4$, an $S$ configuration becomes an $R$ configuration.\n    - The configuration at $C_4$ is $R$. Therefore, $b_4 = 1$.\n\n**Analysis of Stereocenter $C_5$:**\nThe four substituents on $C_5$ are: $-\\mathrm{OH}$, $-\\mathrm{H}$, the upper chain ($-C_4...C_1$), and the lower group ($-\\mathrm{CH_2OH}$, i.e., $C_6$).\n1.  **Assign priorities**:\n    - $-\\mathrm{OH}$ is priority $1$; $-\\mathrm{H}$ is priority $4$.\n    - We compare the upper chain (attached at $C_4$) and the lower group (attached at $C_6$).\n    - The carbon $C_4$ is bonded to $(\\mathrm{O}, C_3, \\mathrm{H})$.\n    - The carbon $C_6$ is bonded to $(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{H})$.\n    - Comparing the atom lists $(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{H})$ for $C_4$ and $(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{H})$ for $C_6$, the first point of difference is $\\mathrm{C}$ versus $\\mathrm{H}$. Since $Z(\\mathrm{C}) > Z(\\mathrm{H})$, the upper chain has higher priority.\n    - The priorities at $C_5$ are: ($1$) $-\\mathrm{OH}$, ($2$) $-C_4...C_1$, ($3$) $-\\mathrm{CH_2OH}$, ($4$) $-\\mathrm{H}$.\n2.  **Determine configuration**:\n    - The lowest-priority group, $-\\mathrm{H}$, is on a horizontal bond.\n    - The sequence $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ runs from $-\\mathrm{OH}$ (right) to the upper chain (top) to the $-\\mathrm{CH_2OH}$ group (bottom). This path traces a counter-clockwise direction.\n    - Inverting due to the horizontal position of group $4$, an $S$ configuration becomes an $R$ configuration.\n    - The configuration at $C_5$ is $R$.

Xylitol obtained from D-xylose is chiral because it contains three stereogenic centers; reduction of D- and L-xylose yields enantiomeric xylitols.\n\nC. Xylitol is achiral only in cyclic hemiacetal forms; the open-chain alditol is chiral because its terminal groups are not identical.\n\nD. Xylitol is produced as a racemic mixture because reduction creates a new stereocenter at $\\mathrm{C}_{1}$ during conversion of the aldehyde to $\\mathrm{CH_{2}OH}$.", "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific and logical integrity.\n\nStep 1: Extract Givens\n-   Aldoses can be reduced at the aldehyde carbonyl to give their corresponding alditols (sugar alcohols).\n-   The carbonyl carbon becomes a primary alcohol ($-\\mathrm{CH_2OH}$) without creating a new stereocenter at that carbon.\n-   The specific reaction is the reduction of the open-chain form of D-xylose to xylitol.\n-   The analysis must use the following definitions:\n    -   (i) A molecule is chiral if and only if it lacks every improper symmetry element (mirror plane, inversion center, or improper rotation axis).\n    -   (ii) An achiral molecule can possess stereogenic centers when it contains an internal mirror plane (a meso compound).\n    -   (iii) The reduction preserves configurations at pre-existing stereogenic centers and converts the aldehyde at $C_{1}$ into $-\\mathrm{CH_2OH}$.\n-   The task is to determine the most accurate statement about the stereochemical nature of xylitol obtained from D-xylose, justifying the choice by analyzing internal symmetry.\n\nStep 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The reduction of an aldose to an alditol is a standard chemical reaction. The definitions provided for chirality, meso compounds, and the specifics of the reduction are correct and well-established in stereochemistry. The starting material, D-xylose, is a well-defined chemical entity. The problem is well-posed, asking for a determination of a chemical property based on a defined starting material and transformation. It is objective and free of ambiguity. The problem is self-contained and does not violate any fundamental principles of chemistry or logic.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A rigorous solution will now be derived.\n\nThe solution requires determining the stereochemical properties of xylitol, the product of the reduction of D-xylose. This will be accomplished by analyzing the structure of the product for symmetry elements.\n\nFirst, we must establish the structure of the reactant, D-xylose. D-xylose is a D-aldopentose. The \"D\" designation indicates that the hydroxyl group on the highest-numbered stereocenter ($C_4$) is on the right side in its Fischer projection. For D-xylose, the sequence of hydroxyl group orientations at $C_2$, $C_3$, and $C_4$ is right, left, right.\n\nThe Fischer projection of D-xylose is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{CHO} \\\\\n| \\\\\n\\text{H}-\\text{C}-\\text{OH} \\\\\n| \\\\\n\\text{HO}-\\text{C}-\\text{H} \\\\\n| \\\\\n\\text{H}-\\text{C}-\\text{OH} \\\\\n| \\\\\n\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}\n\\end{array}\n\\quad\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\leftarrow C_1 \\\\\n\\leftarrow C_2 \\\\\n\\leftarrow C_3 \\\\\n\\leftarrow C_4 \\\\\n\\leftarrow C_5\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nNext, we apply the reduction reaction as defined in the problem. The aldehyde group ($-\\mathrm{CHO}$) at $C_1$ is reduced to a primary alcohol group ($-\\mathrm{CH_2OH}$), while the stereochemical configurations at the pre-existing stereocenters ($C_2$, $C_3$, and $C_4$) are preserved.\n\nThe structure of the resulting alditol, xylitol, is therefore:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH} \\\\\n| \\\\\n\\text{H}-\\text{C}-\\text{OH} \\\\\n| \\\\\n\\text{HO}-\\text{C}-\\text{H} \\\\\n| \\\\\n\\text{H}-\\text{C}-\\text{OH} \\\\\n| \\\\\n\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}\n\\end{array}\n\\quad\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\leftarrow C_1 \\\\\n\\leftarrow C_2 \\\\\n\\leftarrow C_3 \\\\\n\\leftarrow C_4 \\\\\n\\leftarrow C_5\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nNow, we must analyze this structure for chirality based on the provided definitions. A molecule is achiral if it possesses an improper symmetry element, such as a mirror plane ($\\sigma$). An achiral molecule that contains stereogenic centers is defined as a meso compound.\n\nThe xylitol molecule has stereogenic centers at $C_2$ and $C_4$. $C_3$ is a pseudoasymmetric center, as it is bonded to $H$, $OH$, and two enantiomeric groups (if we consider the chain from top and bottom), but we can determine overall chirality without this detail. The test for achirality is to see if the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n\nLet us draw the mirror image of the xylitol molecule derived from D-xylose:\n\n$$\n\\text{Xylitol (from D-xylose)} \\quad \\quad \\quad \\text{Mirror Image}\n$$\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH} \\\\\n| \\\\\n\\text{H}-\\text{C}-\\text{OH} \\\\\n| \\\\\n\\text{HO}-\\text{C}-\\text{H} \\\\\n| \\\\\n\\text{H}-\\text{C}-\\text{OH} \\\\\n| \\\\\n\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}\n\\end{array}\n\\quad \\quad \\quad\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH} \\\\\n| \\\\\n\\text{HO}-\\text{C}-\\text{H} \\\\\n| \\\\\n\\text{H}-\\text{C}-\\text{OH} \\\\\n| \\\\\n\\text{HO}-\\text{C}-\\text{H} \\\\\n| \\\\\n\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nTo test for superimposability, we can perform a valid manipulation on the mirror image. For a Fischer projection with identical terminal groups, a $180^\\circ$ rotation in the plane of the paper is a valid spatial rotation of the molecule. Let's apply this rotation to the mirror image. This operation swaps the top group ($C_1$) with the bottom group ($C_5$), and it inverts the left/right positions of all substituents on the chiral carbons.\n\nThe mirror image has an OH-group arrangement (from $C_2$ to $C_4$) of: left, right, left.\nAfter a $180^\\circ$ in-plane rotation, the new arrangement read from top to bottom ($C_2$ to $C_4$) will be: right, left, right.\n\nThe rotated mirror image has the following structure:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH} \\\\\n| \\\\\n\\text{H}-\\text{C}-\\text{OH} \\\\\n| \\\\\n\\text{HO}-\\text{C}-\\text{H} \\\\\n| \\\\\n\\text{H}-\\text{C}-\\text{OH} \\\\\n| \\\\\n\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThis structure is identical to the original xylitol molecule derived from D-xylose. Since the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image, it is achiral. Because it is an achiral molecule that contains stereogenic centers, xylitol is a meso compound. The existence of superimposability implies the presence of an internal plane of symmetry. This plane of symmetry passes through the $C_3$ atom and its $H$ and $OH$ substituents in a specific conformation of the molecule.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\nA. Xylitol obtained from D-xylose is achiral (meso) because the open-chain alditol has an internal mirror plane that bisects the molecule; reduction of either D- or L-xylose yields the same xylitol.\nThis statement first claims that xylitol is achiral (meso) due to an internal mirror plane. Our derivation confirms this.\nSecond, it claims that reduction of D- or L-xylose yields the same xylitol. Let's verify this. L-xylose is the enantiomer of D-xylose. Its reduction yields the mirror image of the xylitol produced from D-xylose. Since we proved that xylitol is a meso compound and is identical to its mirror image, it follows logically that the products from both D- and L-xylose are the same, identical molecule. Xylitol is xylitol, an achiral compound. Therefore, this entire statement is correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Xylitol obtained from D-xylose is chiral because it contains three stereogenic centers; reduction of D- and L-xylose yields enantiomeric xylitols.\nThis statement claims xylitol is chiral. Our derivation shows it is achiral. It also claims there are three stereogenic centers; in fact, there are two ($C_2, C_4$) and one pseudoasymmetric center ($C_3$). Even if one were to loosely count all three, the conclusion of chirality is false. Finally, it claims reduction of D- and L-xylose gives enantiomers. This is false, as they yield the same achiral compound.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Xylitol is achiral only in cyclic hemiacetal forms; the open-chain alditol is chiral because its terminal groups are not identical.\nThis statement contains multiple falsehoods. First, xylitol is an alditol (a sugar alcohol) and lacks a carbonyl group; it cannot form a hemiacetal. This part of the statement is chemically nonsensical. Second, it claims the open-chain alditol is chiral, which is incorrect. Third, it claims the terminal groups are not identical. The terminal groups are both $-\\mathrm{CH_2OH}$ and are, in fact, identical.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Xylitol is produced as a racemic mixture because reduction creates a new stereocenter at $\\mathrm{C}_{1}$ during conversion of the aldehyde to $\\mathrm{CH_{2}OH}$.\nThis statement is incorrect. The reduction of the aldehyde group ($-\\mathrm{CHO}$) to a primary alcohol group ($-\\mathrm{CH_2OH}$) does not create a stereocenter. A carbon atom must be bonded to four different groups to be a stereocenter; the $C_1$ carbon in xylitol is bonded to two hydrogen atoms, one hydroxyl group, and the rest of the carbon chain. Furthermore, since the product molecule (xylitol) is achiral, it cannot form a racemic mixture, which is by definition an equimolar mixture of two enantiomers. A single, achiral product is formed.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis of the stereochemistry of xylitol, only option A is scientifically and logically sound.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2578447"}]}
