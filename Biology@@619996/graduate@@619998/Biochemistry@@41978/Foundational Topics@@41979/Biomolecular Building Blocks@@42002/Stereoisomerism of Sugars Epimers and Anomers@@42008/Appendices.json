Let the number of stereogenic centers be $n$.\n- Each stereogenic center can adopt one of two configurations.\n- There is no internal plane of symmetry, and thus no meso form exists in the open-chain structure.\n- Only configurational stereoisomerism is to be considered.\n- The problem asks for the determination of three quantities based on fundamental definitions:\n    1. $T$: the total number of configurational stereoisomers in the open-chain form.\n    2. $P$: the number of enantiomeric pairs among the $T$ stereoisomers.\n    3. $E$: the number of distinct single-center epimers for a fixed, specific open-chain stereoisomer.\n- Finally, the problem requires the computation of a single scalar quantity $S = T + P + E$.\n\nStep 2: Validation Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the required criteria:\n- **Scientific Groundedness**: The problem is rooted in the fundamental principles of stereochemistry, specifically as applied to carbohydrates (aldohexoses). The definitions of stereoisomer, enantiomer, and epimer are standard in organic chemistry and biochemistry. The structure described corresponds to a well-understood class of molecules. The problem is scientifically valid.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is clearly stated. The number of stereogenic centers is unambiguously determined to be $4$ (carbons $2$, $3$, $4$, and $5$). The constraint that no meso forms exist simplifies the calculation and removes ambiguity. The questions posed for $T$, $P$, and $E$ are precise and lead to a unique numerical solution. The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem uses precise, objective scientific language and is free from subjective or speculative content.\n\nThe problem statement has no discernible flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, incomplete, contradictory, or ambiguous. It is a formal problem in stereochemistry that can be solved from first principles.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds by calculating the quantities $T$, $P$, and $E$ in sequence, based on the provided information and the fundamental definitions of stereoisomerism.\n\n1.  Determination of $T$, the Total Number of Configurational Stereoisomers.\nThe number of stereogenic centers is given by the carbons from $2$ to $5$, so $n=4$.\nThe total number of possible stereoisomers for a molecule with $n$ stereogenic centers is, in the general case, given by $2^n$. This formula gives the maximum possible number of isomers.\nThe problem explicitly states that there is no internal plane ofsymmetry, which means no meso compounds exist among the stereoisomers. A meso compound is an achiral compound that has chiral centers, and its existence reduces the total number of unique stereoisomers to a value less than $2^n$.\nSince no meso forms exist, every combination of configurations at the $n=4$ stereocenters results in a unique, chiral molecule.\nTherefore, the total number of stereoisomers $T$ is exactly $2^n$.\n$$T = 2^4 = 16$$\n\n2.  Determination of $P$, the Number of Enantiomeric Pairs.\nEnantiomers are a pair of stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. A chiral molecule has exactly one enantiomer. An achiral molecule (like a meso compound) is superimposable on its mirror image, so it does not have an enantiomer in the same sense.\nThe problem states that no meso forms exist, which implies all $T=16$ stereoisomers are chiral.\nSince every chiral molecule has a unique enantiomer, the $16$ stereoisomers can be grouped into pairs of enantiomers.\nThe number of such pairs, $P$, is the total number of stereoisomers divided by $2$.\n$$P = \\frac{T}{2} = \\frac{16}{2} = 8$$\n\n3.  Determination of $E$, the Number of Single-Center Epimers.\nEpimers are diastereomers that differ in configuration at only one stereogenic center. The problem asks for the number of distinct single-center epimers for a *fixed, specific* stereoisomer.\nLet us denote this reference stereoisomer as $M$. The stereogenic centers are at positions $C_2$, $C_3$, $C_4$, and $C_5$.\nAn epimer of $M$ can be formed by inverting the configuration at exactly one of these centers, while keeping the others unchanged.\n- Inverting the configuration at $C_2$ produces the $C_2$-epimer.\n- Inverting the configuration at $C_3$ produces the $C_3$-epimer.\n- Inverting the configuration at $C_4$ produces the $C_4$-epimer.\n- Inverting the configuration at $C_5$ produces the $C_5$-epimer.\nEach of these inversions produces a molecule that is distinct from the original molecule $M$ and also distinct from the other epimers. For instance, the $C_2$-epimer differs from $M$ only at $C_2$. The $C_3$-epimer differs from $M$ only at $C_3$. Therefore, the $C_2$-epimer and the $C_3$-epimer differ from each other at two centers ($C_2$ and $C_3$).\nThe number of distinct single-center epimers is therefore equal to the number of stereogenic centers at which a configuration can be inverted.\nThe number of stereogenic centers is $n=4$.\nThus, the number of epimers $E$ is $4$.\n$$E = 4$$\n\nFinally, we compute the scalar quantity $S$.\nThe problem defines $S$ as the sum of $T$, $P$, and $E$.\n$$S = T + P + E$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$S = 16 + 8 + 4 = 28$$\nThe final result is an exact integer, as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{28}\n$$", "id": "2608275"}, {"introduction": "Accurately representing three-dimensional sugar structures in two dimensions is a crucial skill, but it is also a common source of error.

The student's claims, while incorrect, represent common misconceptions, making them a valid basis for a problem designed to test understanding of these principles. The problem is well-posed, asking for an evaluation of provided options against established scientific facts. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and does not violate any scientific laws or contain internal contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nFirst, each of the student's rules must be analyzed for its scientific validity.\n\n-   **Student Rule (i):** \"In the Haworth projection for $\\mathrm{D}$-sugars, any substituent that is on the right in the Fischer projection is drawn up.\"\n    This is incorrect. The standard convention for converting a $\\mathrm{D}$-sugar Fischer projection to a Haworth projection is that substituents on the right side of the Fischer projection are drawn *down*, and substituents on the left are drawn *up*. The terminal $\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$ group (at $C\\text{-}6$ for a hexose) on the $C\\text{-}5$ that defines the $\\mathrm{D}$-configuration is drawn *up*. The student has inverted the rule for $C\\text{-}2$, $C\\text{-}3$ and $C\\text{-}4$.\n\n-   **Student Rule (ii):** \"If the anomeric hydroxyl is axial in a chair, the anomer must be $\\alpha$.\"\n    This is a dangerous oversimplification. For D-aldohexopyranoses like $\\mathrm{D}$-glucose, this statement is true only for the more stable `${}^{4}C_{1}$` chair conformation. In this conformation, the $\\alpha$-anomer has an axial hydroxyl at $C\\text{-}1$, and the $\\beta$-anomer has an equatorial one. However, if the ring undergoes a \"ring flip\" to the less stable `${}^{1}C_{4}$` conformation, all axial and equatorial positions are inverted. The configuration ($\\alpha$ or $\\beta$) is invariant, so in the `${}^{1}C_{4}$` chair, the $\\alpha$-anomer's hydroxyl group becomes equatorial. Therefore, the rule is not general and depends on the specific chair conformation being depicted.\n\n-   **Student Rule (iii):** \"If the $\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$ group is up in the chair, the sugar must be $\\mathrm{D}$.\"\n    This rule is flawed. The $\\mathrm{D}/\\mathrm{L}$ designation is determined by the absolute configuration of the highest-numbered stereocenter in the open-chain Fischer projection ($C\\text{-}5$ for aldohexoses). For a $\\mathrm{D}$-sugar, the hydroxyl at this carbon is on the right. This results in the $\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$ group being \"up\" in the Haworth projection. In the most stable `${}^{4}C_{1}$` chair conformation of a $\\mathrm{D}$-hexopyranose, this \"up\" group is equatorial. In the `${}^{1}C_{4}$` conformation, it is \"up\" and axial. The term \"up\" in a chair drawing is relative and not a rigorous determinant of absolute configuration without further context. The fundamental definition is what must be used.\n\n-   **Student Rule (iv):** \"In a furanose ring formed from $\\mathrm{D}$-glucose, the anomeric carbon is $C\\text{-}2$.\"\n    This is incorrect. The anomeric carbon is, by definition, the carbon atom that was the carbonyl carbon in the open-chain form. For an aldose like glucose, the carbonyl group is the aldehyde at $C\\text{-}1$. Therefore, the anomeric carbon is $C\\text{-}1$ regardless of whether a five-membered (furanose) or six-membered (pyranose) ring is formed. The anomeric carbon is $C\\text{-}2$ for ketoses like fructose, where the carbonyl group is a ketone at the $C\\text{-}2$ position.\n\n-   **Student Rule (v):** \"When converting a Haworth projection of a pyranose to a chair, any substituent drawn down in Haworth should be made axial in the chair.\"\n    This is completely incorrect. In a chair conformation, whether a substituent is axial or equatorial depends on its position on the ring and whether it is \"up\" or \"down\". In a standard `${}^{4}C_{1}$` chair, \"down\" substituents are alternately axial and equatorial around the ring: axial at $C\\text{-}1$, equatorial at $C\\text{-}2$, axial at $C\\text{-}3$, equatorial at $C\\text{-}4$, and axial at $C\\text{-}5$. A single rule cannot apply to all positions.\n\nNow, we evaluate each of the proposed corrections.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. For $\\mathrm{D}$-aldopyranoses, groups on the right in the Fischer projection map down in the Haworth projection, and groups on the left map up; $\\alpha/\\beta$ is then assigned by the relative orientation of the anomeric substituent to the $\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$ at $C\\text{-}5$ in the ring.**\nThe first part of this statement, \"groups on the right in the Fischer projection map down in the Haworth projection, and groups on the left map up,\" is the correct rule for converting Fischer to Haworth projections for $\\mathrm{D}$-sugars. This directly and accurately corrects student rule (i). The second part states that $\\alpha/\\beta$ can be assigned based on the relationship between the anomeric substituent and the $\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$ group. For $\\mathrm{D}$-sugars, the $\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$ group is \"up\". The $\\alpha$-anomer has the anomeric hydroxyl \"down\" (trans to $\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$), and the $\\beta$-anomer has it \"up\" (cis to $\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$). This is a valid and commonly used convention for assigning configuration from a Haworth projection, preventing the kind of error the student makes with rule (ii). The entire statement is scientifically correct and serves as an effective correction.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. $\\alpha/\\beta$ can be assigned by “axial equals $\\alpha$” regardless of the chair conformation; this holds across `${}^{4}C_{1}$` and `${}^{1}C_{4}$` chairs.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. As explained in the analysis of student rule (ii), the relationship \"axial equals $\\alpha$\" is only valid for the `${}^{4}C_{1}$` chair conformation of $\\mathrm{D}$-aldopyranoses. Upon ring inversion to the `${}^{1}C_{4}$` conformation, an axial group becomes equatorial and vice-versa. Since the $\\alpha$ configuration is an intrinsic property of the molecule, in the `${}^{1}C_{4}$` chair the $\\alpha$-anomeric hydroxyl is equatorial. This option attempts to correct a flawed rule with another, equally flawed, blanket statement.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $\\mathrm{D}/\\mathrm{L}$ is assigned by the absolute configuration at the highest-numbered stereocenter in the Fischer projection (for aldoses, $C\\text{-}5$), not by whether the $\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$ happens to be up or down in a particular chair drawing.**\nThis statement provides the formal, IUPAC-sanctioned definition for the $\\mathrm{D}/\\mathrm{L}$ nomenclature of sugars. It correctly identifies the determinant as the configuration of the stereocenter furthest from the carbonyl group ($C\\text{-}5$ for D-glucose). It explicitly refutes the student's flawed, observation-based shortcut in rule (iii). This is the most robust and scientifically correct principle to prevent misassignment of $\\mathrm{D}/\\mathrm{L}$ configuration.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. In cyclic forms, the anomeric carbon is the former carbonyl carbon of the open chain. Thus, for D-glucose (an aldose), the anomeric carbon is $C\\text{-}1$ in both pyranose and furanose rings; only for ketoses such as D-fructose is the anomeric carbon $C\\text{-}2$.**\nThis statement begins with the precise definition of the anomeric carbon. It correctly applies this definition to the aldose $\\mathrm{D}$-glucose, concluding that its anomeric carbon is $C\\text{-}1$ for any ring size. It correctly contrasts this with ketoses like $\\mathrm{D}$-fructose, where the anomeric carbon is $C\\text{-}2$. This provides a complete and accurate correction to the student's erroneous claim in rule (iv).\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. When converting Haworth to a `${}^{4}C_{1}$` chair, place all substituents drawn down in Haworth into equatorial positions to minimize $1,3$-diaxial interactions; “down” and equatorial should coincide at every ring carbon in a correct `${}^{4}C_{1}$` depiction.**\nThis statement is factually wrong. As analyzed for student rule (v), the correlation between \"down\" in Haworth and axial/equatorial in the chair alternates around the ring. For a `${}^{4}C_{1}$` chair, a \"down\" substituent is axial at $C\\text{-}1$, $C\\text{-}3$, $C\\text{-}5$, and equatorial at $C\\text{-}2$, $C\\text{-}4$. The claim that \"down\" should coincide with equatorial at *every* carbon is false. For example, in the most stable chair of $\\alpha$-$\\mathrm{D}$-glucopyranose, the anomeric hydroxyl at $C\\text{-}1$ is \"down\" and axial. The premise of minimizing $1,3$-diaxial interactions is a principle for determining conformational stability, not a rule for drawing a structure from a 2D projection. The proposed rule would construct an incorrect molecule.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nFinal selection includes options A, C, and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2608287"}, {"introduction": "The concepts of anomers and equilibrium are not just theoretical; they have tangible, measurable consequences.
