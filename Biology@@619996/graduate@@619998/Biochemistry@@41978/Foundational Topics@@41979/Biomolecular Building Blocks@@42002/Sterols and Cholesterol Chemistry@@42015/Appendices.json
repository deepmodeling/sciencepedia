We may therefore proceed directly to the derivation and solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the fraction of total flux, $f_{B}$, directed through the Bloch variant of cholesterol biosynthesis. This fraction is defined as:\n$$\nf_{B} = \\frac{v_{B}}{v_{B} + v_{K}}\n$$\nwhere $v_{B}$ and $v_{K}$ are the instantaneous reaction velocities for the Bloch and Kandutsch–Russell pathways, respectively. The expressions for these velocities are given as:\n$$\nv_{B} = V_{\\max,B}\\,A([X])\\,\\frac{[S]}{K_{m,B} + [S]}\n$$\n$$\nv_{K} = V_{\\max,K}\\,I_{\\mathrm{nc}}([I])\\,\\frac{[S]}{K_{m,K} + [S]}\n$$\nThe regulatory factors $A([X])$ and $I_{\\mathrm{nc}}([I])$ are given by:\n$$\nA([X]) = 1 + \\alpha \\frac{[X]}{K_{A} + [X]}\n$$\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{nc}}([I]) = \\frac{1}{1 + [I]/K_{i}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $v_{B}$ and $v_{K}$ into the definition of $f_{B}$ yields the complete analytical expression:\n$$\nf_{B} = \\frac{V_{\\max,B} \\left( 1 + \\alpha \\frac{[X]}{K_{A} + [X]} \\right) \\frac{[S]}{K_{m,B} + [S]}}{V_{\\max,B} \\left( 1 + \\alpha \\frac{[X]}{K_{A} + [X]} \\right) \\frac{[S]}{K_{m,B} + [S]} + V_{\\max,K} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + [I]/K_{i}} \\right) \\frac{[S]}{K_{m,K} + [S]}}\n$$\nTo evaluate this expression, we first compute the values of the regulatory factors and the substrate saturation terms using the provided parameters.\n\nThe parameters are:\n- Substrate: $[S] = 2.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- Bloch enzyme ($E_{B}$): $V_{\\max,B} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{nmol\\,min^{-1}\\,mg^{-1}}$, $K_{m,B} = 0.8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- Kandutsch–Russell enzyme ($E_{K}$): $V_{\\max,K} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{nmol\\,min^{-1}\\,mg^{-1}}$, $K_{m,K} = 0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- Activation ($E_{B}$): $[X] = 0.3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $\\alpha = 0.6$, $K_{A} = 0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- Inhibition ($E_{K}$): $[I] = 0.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $K_{i} = 0.4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the activation factor for $E_{B}$:\n$$\nA([X]) = 1 + (0.6) \\frac{0.3}{0.5 + 0.3} = 1 + (0.6) \\frac{0.3}{0.8} = 1 + (0.6)(0.375) = 1 + 0.225 = 1.225\n$$\nNext, we calculate the inhibition factor for $E_{K}$:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{nc}}([I]) = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.2/0.4} = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.5} = \\frac{1}{1.5} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nNow, we can compute the individual flux rates, $v_{B}$ and $v_{K}$. The units of velocity ($\\mathrm{nmol\\,min^{-1}\\,mg^{-1}}$) are consistent and will cancel in the final ratio for $f_{B}$, so we can proceed with the numerical values.\n\nFor the Bloch pathway flux, $v_{B}$:\n$$\nv_{B} = (1.5) \\cdot (1.225) \\cdot \\frac{2.0}{0.8 + 2.0} = (1.8375) \\cdot \\frac{2.0}{2.8} = (1.8375) \\cdot \\frac{5}{7} = \\frac{9.1875}{7} = 1.3125\n$$\nFor the Kandutsch–Russell pathway flux, $v_{K}$:\n$$\nv_{K} = (1.2) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{2.0}{0.5 + 2.0} = (0.8) \\cdot \\frac{2.0}{2.5} = (0.8) \\cdot (0.8) = 0.64\n$$\nFinally, we compute the fraction $f_{B}$ using the calculated flux values:\n$$\nf_{B} = \\frac{v_{B}}{v_{B} + v_{K}} = \\frac{1.3125}{1.3125 + 0.64} = \\frac{1.3125}{1.9525}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\nf_{B} \\approx 0.67221510883\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nf_{B} \\approx 0.6722\n$$\nThis result indicates that under the specified conditions, approximately $67.22\\%$ of the flux from the precursor $S$ proceeds through the Bloch variant.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.6722}\n$$", "id": "2608665"}]}
