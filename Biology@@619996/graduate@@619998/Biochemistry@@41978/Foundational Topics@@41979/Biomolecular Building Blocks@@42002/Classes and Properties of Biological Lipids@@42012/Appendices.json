The local pH at the surface, $pH_{\\text{local}}$, is shifted from the bulk pH, $pH_{\\text{bulk}}$, due to the electrostatic surface potential, $\\psi_0$. The concentration of protons (charge $z=+1$) at the surface follows the Boltzmann distribution:\n\n$$\n[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_{\\text{local}} = [\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_{\\text{bulk}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{F \\psi_0}{R T}\\right)\n$$\n\nTaking the negative base-$10$ logarithm of both sides to convert to pH:\n\n$$\n-\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_{\\text{local}}) = -\\log_{10}\\left([\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_{\\text{bulk}}\\right) - \\log_{10}\\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{F \\psi_0}{R T}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nThis gives the relationship between local and bulk pH:\n\n$$\npH_{\\text{local}} = pH_{\\text{bulk}} - \\left(-\\frac{F \\psi_0}{R T}\\right) \\log_{10}(e)\n$$\n\nUsing the identity $\\log_{10}(e) = \\frac{1}{\\ln(10)} = \\frac{1}{2.303}$, we obtain:\n\n$$\npH_{\\text{local}} = pH_{\\text{bulk}} + \\frac{F \\psi_0}{2.303 R T}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $pK_a^{\\text{intr}}$ and $pH_{\\text{local}}$ into the exponent term of the equation for $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{H}}$:\n\n$$\npH_{\\text{local}} - pK_a^{\\text{intr}} = \\left(pH_{\\text{bulk}} + \\frac{F \\psi_0}{2.303 R T}\\right) - \\left(pK_a^0 + \\frac{\\Delta G_{\\text{intr}}}{2.303 R T}\\right)\n$$\n\nCombining terms yields the final expression for the exponent:\n\n$$\npH_{\\text{local}} - pK_a^{\\text{intr}} = (pH_{\\text{bulk}} - pK_a^0) + \\frac{F \\psi_0 - \\Delta G_{\\text{intr}}}{2.303 R T}\n$$\n\nSubstituting this back into the formula for $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{H}}$ gives the complete, closed-form expression requested:\n\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{\\left( (pH_{\\text{bulk}} - pK_a^0) + \\frac{F \\psi_0 - \\Delta G_{\\text{intr}}}{2.303 R T} \\right)}}\n$$\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically using the given values:\n- $pH_{\\text{bulk}} = 5.50$\n- $pK_a^0 = 4.50$\n- $\\Delta G_{\\text{intr}} = +4.00\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1} = 4000\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}$\n- $\\psi_0 = -60\\ \\text{mV} = -0.060\\ \\text{V}$\n- $T = 310\\ \\text{K}$\n- $R = 8.314\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}\\ \\text{K}^{-1}$\n- $F = 96485\\ \\text{C mol}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the scaling factor $2.303 R T$:\n\n$$\n2.303 R T = 2.303 \\times (8.314\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}\\ \\text{K}^{-1}) \\times (310\\ \\text{K}) \\approx 5934.75\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the terms in the exponent. The difference in pH and pKa is:\n\n$$\npH_{\\text{bulk}} - pK_a^0 = 5.50 - 4.50 = 1.00\n$$\n\nThe energy term in the exponent requires calculating the electrostatic work $F \\psi_0$:\n\n$$\nF \\psi_0 = (96485\\ \\text{C mol}^{-1}) \\times (-0.060\\ \\text{V}) = -5789.1\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}\n$$\n\nThe total energy difference is $F \\psi_0 - \\Delta G_{\\text{intr}}$:\n\n$$\nF \\psi_0 - \\Delta G_{\\text{intr}} = -5789.1\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1} - 4000\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1} = -9789.1\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}\n$$\n\nThe second part of the exponent is then:\n\n$$\n\\frac{F \\psi_0 - \\Delta G_{\\text{intr}}}{2.303 R T} = \\frac{-9789.1\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}}{5934.75\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}} \\approx -1.64945\n$$\n\nThe total exponent is the sum of the two parts:\n\n$$\n\\text{Exponent} = 1.00 + (-1.64945) = -0.64945\n$$\n\nFinally, we calculate $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{H}}$:\n\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-0.64945}} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 0.22416} = \\frac{1}{1.22416} \\approx 0.81689\n$$\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{H}} = 0.817$. This indicates that at the given bulk pH and under the specified membrane conditions, approximately $81.7\\%$ of the lipid headgroups are in their protonated ($\\mathrm{HA}$) state.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.817}\n$$", "id": "2551443"}]}
