The final numerical answer must be rounded to five significant figures.\n\nThe problem is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded, describing a real biochemical compound (oleic acid) and requiring standard procedures from organic chemistry and analytical chemistry (IUPAC nomenclature, molecular formula determination, and mass calculation). All data required for a unique solution are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is well-posed and objective. Thus, a solution will be constructed.\n\nThe solution is a three-part process: determination of the IUPAC name, deduction of the molecular formula, and calculation of the monoisotopic mass.\n\nFirst, the systematic IUPAC name is constructed. The parent hydrocarbon chain contains $18$ carbon atoms, for which the root name is 'octadec-'. The principal functional group is a carboxylic acid, indicated by the suffix '-oic acid'. A saturated $18$-carbon carboxylic acid would be named octadecanoic acid. The presence of a single double bond changes the infix from '-an-' to '-en-', yielding 'octadecenoic acid'. The position of this double bond must be specified with a locant. Numbering from the carboxyl carbon ($C_1$), the double bond is between $C_9$ and $C_{10}$. The lower locant, $9$, is used, giving 'octadec-$9$-enoic acid'. The stereochemistry of the double bond is given as $Z$. This is specified with the prefix '($Z$)-'. According to current IUPAC recommendations, the locant for the stereocenter is placed with the descriptor, resulting in '($9Z$)-'. Therefore, the complete systematic IUPAC name is ($9Z$)-octadec-$9$-enoic acid.\n\nSecond, the molecular formula is deduced. A saturated acyclic carboxylic acid with $n$ carbon atoms has the general formula $\\mathrm{C}_n\\mathrm{H}_{2n}\\mathrm{O}_2$. For $n=18$, the saturated analogue (octadecanoic acid) would have the formula $\\mathrm{C}_{18}\\mathrm{H}_{36}\\mathrm{O}_2$. Each double bond introduced into a hydrocarbon chain results in the removal of two hydrogen atoms. This molecule contains one double bond. Consequently, its molecular formula is derived by subtracting two hydrogens from the saturated formula: $\\mathrm{C}_{18}\\mathrm{H}_{36-2}\\mathrm{O}_2$, which is $\\mathrm{C}_{18}\\mathrm{H}_{34}\\mathrm{O}_2$. The structure contains two oxygen atoms as part of the carboxyl group.\n\nThird, the monoisotopic mass is calculated. The monoisotopic mass is the sum of the masses of the single most abundant (or specified) isotopes of each element in the molecule. The molecular formula is $\\mathrm{C}_{18}\\mathrm{H}_{34}\\mathrm{O}_2$. The required masses are given for the isotopes $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$, $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$, and $^{16}\\mathrm{O}$. The total mass, $M$, is calculated as:\n$$M = (N_C \\times m(^{12}\\mathrm{C})) + (N_H \\times m(^{1}\\mathrm{H})) + (N_O \\times m(^{16}\\mathrm{O}))$$\nwhere $N_C$, $N_H$, and $N_O$ are the numbers of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, respectively.\nSubstituting the values:\n$N_C = 18$\n$N_H = 34$\n$N_O = 2$\n$m(^{12}\\mathrm{C}) = 12.000000\\,\\mathrm{Da}$\n$m(^{1}\\mathrm{H}) = 1.00782503223\\,\\mathrm{Da}$\n$m(^{16}\\mathrm{O}) = 15.99491461957\\,\\mathrm{Da}$\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\nContribution from carbon: $18 \\times 12.000000\\,\\mathrm{Da} = 216.000000\\,\\mathrm{Da}$\nContribution from hydrogen: $34 \\times 1.00782503223\\,\\mathrm{Da} = 34.26605109582\\,\\mathrm{Da}$\nContribution from oxygen: $2 \\times 15.99491461957\\,\\mathrm{Da} = 31.98982923914\\,\\mathrm{Da}$\n\nSumming these contributions gives the total monoisotopic mass:\n$$M = 216.000000 + 34.26605109582 + 31.98982923914$$\n$$M = 282.25588033496\\,\\mathrm{Da}$$\n\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to five significant figures. The calculated value is $282.25588033496$. The first five significant figures are $2$, $8$, $2$, $2$, and $5$. The sixth significant figure is $5$. Following the standard rounding rule, if the first digit to be dropped is $5$ or greater, the preceding digit is rounded up. Thus, $282.25$ is rounded to $282.26$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{282.26}$$", "id": "2563671"}, {"introduction": "Biochemists often use specialized shorthand to describe fatty acids, focusing on features relevant to metabolism and nutrition.

This is a problem of stereochemistry, and the solution must be derived by identifying all stereogenic elements within the molecule and applying the fundamental principles of isomer enumeration.\n\nThe given molecule is a monocarboxylic fatty acid with the following structural features:\n1.  A straight, unbranched chain of $18$ carbon atoms. The parent alkane is octadecane, and the carboxylic acid is octadecanoic acid.\n2.  A hydroxy substituent ($-\\text{OH}$) at carbon $5$. Numbering begins with the carboxyl carbon as $C_1$.\n3.  A conjugated diene system with double bonds at positions $C_9–C_{10}$ and $C_{11}–C_{12}$.\n\nThe total number of stereoisomers is given by the formula $2^n$, where $n$ is the number of stereogenic elements, provided the molecule does not possess any internal symmetry that would lead to meso compounds. We must systematically identify each stereogenic element.\n\nFirst, we analyze potential chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four distinct substituent groups. The problem specifies a hydroxy group at carbon $5$. Let us examine the four groups attached to $C_5$:\n1.  A hydrogen atom ($-\\text{H}$).\n2.  A hydroxy group ($-\\text{OH}$).\n3.  The portion of the chain towards the carboxyl group: $-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{COOH}$. This is a propyl group substituted with a carboxyl function. Its formula is $-(\\text{CH}_2)_3\\text{COOH}$.\n4.  The portion of the chain towards the methyl terminus: $-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}=\\text{CH}-\\text{CH}=\\text{CH}-(\\text{CH}_2)_5-\\text{CH}_3$. This is a tridecenyl group containing the conjugated diene.\n\nThe four substituents are unequivocally different. Therefore, carbon $5$ is a stereocenter (chiral center). According to the Cahn–Ingold–Prelog (CIP) rules, this center can exist in two distinct absolute configurations, designated as $(R)$ or $(S)$. This single stereocenter contributes a factor of $2$ to the total number of stereoisomers.\n\nSecond, we analyze the double bonds for potential geometric isomerism. A double bond can exhibit $E/Z$ isomerism if each of its two carbon atoms is bonded to two different groups.\n\nLet us examine the double bond between $C_9$ and $C_{10}$:\n-   Carbon $9$ is bonded to a hydrogen atom and the alkyl chain fragment extending to the carboxyl group, $-(\\text{CH}_2)_3-\\text{CH}(\\text{OH})-(\\text{CH}_2)_3-\\text{COOH}$.\n-   Carbon $10$ is bonded to a hydrogen atom and the rest of the conjugated system and chain, $-\\text{CH}=\\text{CH}-(\\text{CH}_2)_5-\\text{CH}_3$.\nSince the two groups on $C_9$ are different and the two groups on $C_{10}$ are different, this double bond is a stereogenic element. It can exist in two configurations, designated as $(E)$ or $(Z)$. This contributes a second factor of $2$.\n\nNow, let us examine the double bond between $C_{11}$ and $C_{12}$:\n-   Carbon $11$ is bonded to a hydrogen atom and the chain fragment $-\\text{CH}=\\text{CH}-(\\text{CH}_2)_3-\\text{CH}(\\text{OH})-(\\text{CH}_2)_3-\\text{COOH}$.\n-   Carbon $12$ is bonded to a hydrogen atom and the terminal alkyl fragment, $-(\\text{CH}_2)_5-\\text{CH}_3$.\nAgain, the two groups on $C_{11}$ are different, and the two groups on $C_{12}$ are different. Therefore, this double bond is also a stereogenic element. It can exist in two configurations, $(E)$ or $(Z)$. This contributes a third factor of $2$.\n\nWe have identified a total of $n=3$ stereogenic elements in the molecule:\n-   One chiral center at $C_5$.\n-   Two configurable double bonds at $C_9$ and $C_{11}$.\n\nThe molecule lacks overall symmetry. The two ends of the chain are functionally different (carboxyl vs. methyl), and the placement of the hydroxy group at $C_5$ is asymmetric with respect to the chain. Consequently, no meso compounds are possible, and all combinations of the individual stereochemical descriptors will result in a unique stereoisomer.\n\nThe total number of distinct stereoisomers is therefore $2^n$. With $n=3$, the calculation is:\n$$ \\text{Total number of stereoisomers} = 2^3 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8 $$\nEach of these $8$ stereoisomers would have a unique, fully specified IUPAC name, for example, $(5R,9E,11E)$-5-hydroxyoctadeca-9,11-dienoic acid, $(5S,9Z,11E)$-5-hydroxyoctadeca-9,11-dienoic acid, and so on for all $8$ combinations.
