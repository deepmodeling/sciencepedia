This is given by the ratio of the termination rate to the total exit rate from state $R$:\n$$\\pi_{\\mathrm{term}} = \\frac{k_{R \\to Term}}{k_{R \\to Term} + k_{R \\to E}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{chem}}^{\\mathrm{term}}}{k_{\\mathrm{chem}}^{\\mathrm{term}} + k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{\\mathrm{RF1}}}$$\nIf dissociation occurs (with probability $1 - \\pi_{\\mathrm{term}}$), the system returns to state $E$, and the process resets.\n\nSimilarly, if the system is in state $T_{Pyl}$, it will either insert Pyl or reject the tRNA. The probability of insertion from state $T_{Pyl}$, denoted $\\pi_{\\mathrm{ins}}$, is:\n$$\\pi_{\\mathrm{ins}} = \\frac{k_{T_{Pyl} \\to Ins}}{k_{T_{Pyl} \\to Ins} + k_{T_{Pyl} \\to E}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{acc}}}{k_{\\mathrm{acc}} + k_{\\mathrm{rej}}}$$\nIf rejection occurs (with probability $1 - \\pi_{\\mathrm{ins}}$), the system returns to state $E$ and the process resets.\n\nNow we can write the overall probability of insertion $P_{\\mathrm{ins}}([T])$ by considering all possible paths from state $E$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{ins}}([T]) = P(E \\to T_{Pyl}) \\cdot \\left( \\pi_{\\mathrm{ins}} \\cdot 1 + (1-\\pi_{\\mathrm{ins}}) \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{ins}}([T]) \\right) + P(E \\to R) \\cdot \\left( \\pi_{\\mathrm{term}} \\cdot 0 + (1-\\pi_{\\mathrm{term}}) \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{ins}}([T]) \\right)$$\nThe first term corresponds to the path through Pyl-tRNA binding, which leads to insertion with probability $\\pi_{\\mathrm{ins}}$ or returns to the start with probability $1-\\pi_{\\mathrm{ins}}$. The second term corresponds to the path through RF1 binding, which leads to termination (zero probability of insertion) with probability $\\pi_{\\mathrm{term}}$ or returns to the start with probability $1-\\pi_{\\mathrm{term}}$.\n\nLet us substitute the expressions for the path probabilities and solve for $P_{\\mathrm{ins}}([T])$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{ins}}([T]) = \\frac{k_{E \\to T_{Pyl}}}{k_{E \\to R} + k_{E \\to T_{Pyl}}} \\left( \\pi_{\\mathrm{ins}} + (1-\\pi_{\\mathrm{ins}}) P_{\\mathrm{ins}}([T]) \\right) + \\frac{k_{E \\to R}}{k_{E \\to R} + k_{E \\to T_{Pyl}}} \\left( (1-\\pi_{\\mathrm{term}}) P_{\\mathrm{ins}}([T]) \\right)$$\nMultiply by the denominator $(k_{E \\to R} + k_{E \\to T_{Pyl}})$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{ins}} (k_{E \\to R} + k_{E \\to T_{Pyl}}) = k_{E \\to T_{Pyl}} (\\pi_{\\mathrm{ins}} + P_{\\mathrm{ins}} - \\pi_{\\mathrm{ins}} P_{\\mathrm{ins}}) + k_{E \\to R} (P_{\\mathrm{ins}} - \\pi_{\\mathrm{term}} P_{\\mathrm{ins}})$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{ins}} k_{E \\to R} + P_{\\mathrm{ins}} k_{E \\to T_{Pyl}} = k_{E \\to T_{Pyl}} \\pi_{\\mathrm{ins}} + P_{\\mathrm{ins}}k_{E \\to T_{Pyl}} - P_{\\mathrm{ins}}k_{E \\to T_{Pyl}}\\pi_{\\mathrm{ins}} + P_{\\mathrm{ins}}k_{E \\to R} - P_{\\mathrm{ins}}k_{E \\to R}\\pi_{\\mathrm{term}}$$\nGrouping terms with $P_{\\mathrm{ins}}([T])$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{ins}} (k_{E \\to R} + k_{E \\to T_{Pyl}} - k_{E \\to T_{Pyl}} + k_{E \\to T_{Pyl}}\\pi_{\\mathrm{ins}} - k_{E \\to R} + k_{E \\to R}\\pi_{\\mathrm{term}}) = k_{E \\to T_{Pyl}}\\pi_{\\mathrm{ins}}$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{ins}} (k_{E \\to T_{Pyl}}\\pi_{\\mathrm{ins}} + k_{E \\to R}\\pi_{\\mathrm{term}}) = k_{E \\to T_{Pyl}}\\pi_{\\mathrm{ins}}$$\nSolving for $P_{\\mathrm{ins}}([T])$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{ins}}([T]) = \\frac{k_{E \\to T_{Pyl}}([T]) \\cdot \\pi_{\\mathrm{ins}}}{k_{E \\to T_{Pyl}}([T]) \\cdot \\pi_{\\mathrm{ins}} + k_{E \\to R} \\cdot \\pi_{\\mathrm{term}}}$$\nThis expression has a clear physical interpretation. The terms $k_{E \\to T_{Pyl}} \\pi_{\\mathrm{ins}}$ and $k_{E \\to R} \\pi_{\\mathrm{term}}$ represent the effective rates of commitment to insertion and termination, respectively. The probability of insertion is the ratio of its effective rate to the sum of all effective rates of commitment.\n\nLet's calculate the numerical values of the constants.\nGiven values:\n$k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{\\mathrm{RF1}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$[\\mathrm{RF1}] = 0.50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} = 0.50 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{M}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{\\mathrm{RF1}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{chem}}^{\\mathrm{term}} = 15\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{del}}^{\\mathrm{Pyl}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{acc}} = 30\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{rej}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, calculate the constant rates and probabilities:\n$k_{E \\to R} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{\\mathrm{RF1}} [\\mathrm{RF1}] = (1.0 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (0.50 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{M}) = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$\\pi_{\\mathrm{term}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{chem}}^{\\mathrm{term}}}{k_{\\mathrm{chem}}^{\\mathrm{term}} + k_{\\mathrm{off}}^{\\mathrm{RF1}}} = \\frac{15\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{15\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 10\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{15}{25} = 0.6$.\n$\\pi_{\\mathrm{ins}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{acc}}}{k_{\\mathrm{acc}} + k_{\\mathrm{rej}}} = \\frac{30\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{30\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 10\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{30}{40} = 0.75$.\n\nThe rate of Pyl-tRNA delivery is $k_{E \\to T_{Pyl}}([T]) = (2.0 \\times 10^{7}) [T]\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ where $[T]$ is in units of M.\n\nNow, we compute the effective rates:\nEffective insertion rate: $k_{\\mathrm{ins,eff}} = k_{E \\to T_{Pyl}}([T]) \\cdot \\pi_{\\mathrm{ins}} = ((2.0 \\times 10^{7}) [T]) \\cdot 0.75 = (1.5 \\times 10^{7}) [T]\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nEffective termination rate: $k_{\\mathrm{term,eff}} = k_{E \\to R} \\cdot \\pi_{\\mathrm{term}} = (5.0\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\cdot 0.6 = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for $P_{\\mathrm{ins}}([T])$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{ins}}([T]) = \\frac{(1.5 \\times 10^{7}) [T]}{(1.5 \\times 10^{7}) [T] + 3.0}$$\nTo obtain the simplest form, we divide the numerator and the denominator by $1.5 \\times 10^{7}$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{ins}}([T]) = \\frac{[T]}{[T] + \\frac{3.0}{1.5 \\times 10^{7}}}$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{ins}}([T]) = \\frac{[T]}{[T] + 2.0 \\times 10^{-7}}$$\nThis is the final simplified analytic expression for the probability of insertion as a function of the Pyl-tRNA concentration $[T]$.
