The data provided (model $\\mathrm{p}K_a$, $\\mathrm{pH}$, distances) are standard and objective.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained for a qualitative analysis. It is valid. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\nThe protonation state of an ionizable group is determined by the relationship between the system's $\\mathrm{pH}$ and the group's acid dissociation constant, $\\mathrm{p}K_a$. This relationship is described by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for an acid HA:\n$$ \\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{p}K_a + \\log_{10} \\frac{[\\mathrm{A}^-]}{[\\mathrm{HA}]} $$\nwhere $\\mathrm{HA}$ is the protonated form (aspartic acid, $\\mathrm{-COOH}$) and $\\mathrm{A}^-$ is the deprotonated form (aspartate, $\\mathrm{-COO}^-$).\n- If $\\mathrm{pH} > \\mathrm{p}K_a$, the deprotonated form, $\\mathrm{A}^-$, dominates.\n- If $\\mathrm{pH} < \\mathrm{p}K_a$, the protonated form, $\\mathrm{HA}$, dominates.\n\nThe $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ itself is a measure of the free energy of deprotonation. Any environmental factor that stabilizes the charged, deprotonated state ($\\mathrm{A}^-$) relative to the neutral, protonated state ($\\mathrm{HA}$) will facilitate deprotonation, thus increasing the dissociation constant $K_a$ and *lowering* the $\\mathrm{p}K_a$. Conversely, any factor that *destabilizes* the charged state will hinder deprotonation, decreasing $K_a$ and *raising* the $\\mathrm{p}K_a$.\n\n**Analysis of $\\mathrm{Asp}^{\\mathrm{surf}}$**\n- This residue is on the protein surface, fully exposed to bulk water. Water is a polar solvent with a high dielectric constant ($\\epsilon \\approx 80$).\n- This environment is very similar to that of the model compound (an amino acid or a small peptide) in an aqueous solution.\n- Therefore, the $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ of $\\mathrm{Asp}^{\\mathrm{surf}}$ is expected to be close to the model value, so $\\mathrm{p}K_{a, \\mathrm{surf}} \\approx 4.0$.\n- At $\\mathrm{pH} = 7.0$, we have $\\mathrm{pH} \\gg \\mathrm{p}K_{a, \\mathrm{surf}}$. According to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the ratio $[\\mathrm{COO}^-]/[\\mathrm{COOH}]$ will be approximately $10^{(7.0 - 4.0)} = 10^3 = 1000$.\n- Thus, at $\\mathrm{pH} = 7.0$, $\\mathrm{Asp}^{\\mathrm{surf}}$ will be almost completely deprotonated, existing as the negatively charged carboxylate, $\\mathrm{-COO}^-$.\n\n**Analysis of $\\mathrm{Asp}^{\\mathrm{core}}$ (without Lysine)**\n- This residue is buried in the protein's hydrophobic core. This environment is non-polar and characterized by a low dielectric constant (typically $\\epsilon \\approx 2-4$).\n- The deprotonation of aspartic acid creates a negative charge: $\\mathrm{-COOH} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{-COO}^- + \\mathrm{H}^+$.\n- Placing a formal charge in a low-dielectric medium is energetically highly unfavorable, an effect known as the desolvation penalty. The medium cannot effectively screen and stabilize the charge. The problem statement also specifies there are no hydrogen bond donors or acceptors nearby to provide stabilization.\n- This significant destabilization of the charged, deprotonated state ($\\mathrm{-COO}^-$) makes deprotonation a much less favorable process compared to the situation in water.\n- Consequently, the equilibrium shifts toward the neutral, protonated state ($\\mathrm{-COOH}$). This corresponds to a smaller $K_a$ and a significantly *elevated* $\\mathrm{p}K_a$. It is common for buried carboxylates to have $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ values greater than $7.0$.\n- Assuming its $\\mathrm{p}K_{a, \\mathrm{core}} > 7.0$, at $\\mathrm{pH} = 7.0$, we have $\\mathrm{pH} < \\mathrm{p}K_{a, \\mathrm{core}}$.\n- Thus, at $\\mathrm{pH} = 7.0$, $\\mathrm{Asp}^{\\mathrm{core}}$ will be predominantly protonated, existing as the neutral carboxylic acid, $\\mathrm{-COOH}$.\n\n**Analysis of $\\mathrm{Asp}^{\\mathrm{core}}$ (with Lysine)**\n- A lysine side chain is introduced near $\\mathrm{Asp}^{\\mathrm{core}}$. The model $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ of a lysine side chain is about $10.5$. At $\\mathrm{pH} = 7.0$, lysine will be protonated, carrying a positive charge ($\\mathrm{-NH}_3^+$).\n- This positive charge is positioned within $3\\,\\text{\\AA}$ of the aspartate's carboxylate group.\n- This arrangement allows for a strong, favorable electrostatic interaction (a salt bridge) between the positive charge of the lysine ($\\mathrm{-NH}_3^+$) and the negative charge of the *deprotonated* aspartate ($\\mathrm{-COO}^-$). The strength of this interaction is magnified by the low-dielectric environment of the protein core.\n- This favorable interaction *stabilizes* the charged, deprotonated state of the aspartate.\n- As established, stabilizing the deprotonated state makes deprotonation more favorable, which increases $K_a$ and *lowers* the $\\mathrm{p}K_a$.\n- Therefore, the introduction of a nearby lysine residue will lower the $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ of $\\mathrm{Asp}^{\\mathrm{core}}$ relative to its value when buried alone. A lower $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ makes deprotonation more favorable at a given $\\mathrm{pH}$.\n\n**Summary of Conclusions**\n1. At $\\mathrm{pH}=7.0$, $\\mathrm{Asp}^{\\mathrm{surf}}$ ($\\mathrm{p}K_a \\approx 4.0$) is deprotonated.\n2. At $\\mathrm{pH}=7.0$, $\\mathrm{Asp}^{\\mathrm{core}}$ ($\\mathrm{p}K_a \\gg 4.0$, likely $>7.0$) is protonated. The reason is the energetic penalty of placing a charge in a low-dielectric environment, which raises the $\\mathrm{p}K_a$.\n3. Introducing a nearby positively charged lysine stabilizes the deprotonated state of $\\mathrm{Asp}^{\\mathrm{core}}$, thereby lowering its $\\mathrm{p}K_a$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the provided options.\n\n**A.** At $\\mathrm{pH}=7.0$, $\\mathrm{Asp}^{\\mathrm{surf}}$ is deprotonated whereas $\\mathrm{Asp}^{\\mathrm{core}}$ is protonated because the low-dielectric core destabilizes charge and raises the $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ of the carboxylate; introducing a nearby lysine lowers the $\\mathrm{Asp}^{\\mathrm{core}}$ $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ relative to the buried-without-lysine case, thereby favoring deprotonation.\n- This statement correctly identifies that $\\mathrm{Asp}^{\\mathrm{surf}}$ is deprotonated and $\\mathrm{Asp}^{\\mathrm{core}}$ is protonated at $\\mathrm{pH}=7.0$. It provides the correct physical reason: the low-dielectric core destabilizes the charge, raising the $\\mathrm{p}K_a$. It also correctly predicts that a nearby cation (from lysine) will stabilize the anion (from deprotonated aspartate), thus lowering the $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ of $\\mathrm{Asp}^{\\mathrm{core}}$ and favoring its deprotonation. Every part of this statement is consistent with our derivation.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.** At $\\mathrm{pH}=7.0$, both $\\mathrm{Asp}^{\\mathrm{surf}}$ and $\\mathrm{Asp}^{\\mathrm{core}}$ are deprotonated because burying a charge stabilizes the carboxylate; introducing a nearby lysine raises the $\\mathrm{Asp}^{\\mathrm{core}}$ $\\mathrm{p}K_a$.\n- The claim that $\\mathrm{Asp}^{\\mathrm{core}}$ is deprotonated is incorrect. The reasoning \"burying a charge stabilizes the carboxylate\" is fundamentally false; burying an uncompensated charge in a low-dielectric medium is destabilizing.

It dismisses the well-established, dominant effect of the local microenvironment on the ionization properties of amino acid side chains.
