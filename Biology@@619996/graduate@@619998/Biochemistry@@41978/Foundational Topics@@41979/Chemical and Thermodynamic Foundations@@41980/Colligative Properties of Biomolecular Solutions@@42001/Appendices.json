The problem is self-contained.\n\nConclusion: The problem is valid. A solution will be furnished.\n\n**Part 1: Thermodynamic Derivation**\n\nAt thermodynamic equilibrium in a membrane osmometry experiment, the chemical potential of the pure solvent, $\\mu_1$, which can pass through the semipermeable membrane, must be equal in both compartments. Let the pure solvent phase be denoted by superscript $0$ and the solution phase be denoted by no superscript. The solution is at an excess pressure, the osmotic pressure $\\Pi$, relative to the pure solvent, which is at pressure $P$.\n\nThe equilibrium condition is:\n$$\n\\mu_1^0(T, P) = \\mu_1(T, P+\\Pi, x_1)\n$$\nwhere $T$ is the absolute temperature, $x_1$ is the mole fraction of the solvent in the solution, and $\\mu_1^0(T, P)$ is the chemical potential of the pure solvent at temperature $T$ and pressure $P$.\n\nThe chemical potential of the solvent in the solution is given by:\n$$\n\\mu_1(T, P+\\Pi, x_1) = \\mu_1^0(T, P+\\Pi) + RT \\ln(\\gamma_1 x_1)\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $\\gamma_1$ is the activity coefficient of the solvent.\n\nSubstituting this into the equilibrium condition gives:\n$$\n\\mu_1^0(T, P) = \\mu_1^0(T, P+\\Pi) + RT \\ln(\\gamma_1 x_1)\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to:\n$$\n-RT \\ln(\\gamma_1 x_1) = \\mu_1^0(T, P+\\Pi) - \\mu_1^0(T, P)\n$$\nThe right-hand side represents the change in the chemical potential of the pure solvent due to the change in pressure from $P$ to $P+\\Pi$. From the fundamental thermodynamic relation $d\\mu = V_m dP - S_m dT$, at constant temperature, we have $(\\partial \\mu_1^0 / \\partial P)_T = V_{m,1}$, where $V_{m,1}$ is the molar volume of the pure solvent. Integrating this from $P$ to $P+\\Pi$:\n$$\n\\mu_1^0(T, P+\\Pi) - \\mu_1^0(T, P) = \\int_{P}^{P+\\Pi} V_{m,1} dP'\n$$\nAssuming the solvent is incompressible, which is an excellent approximation for a liquid like water, $V_{m,1}$ is constant with respect to pressure. The integral simplifies to $V_{m,1} \\Pi$.\n\nThe equation now becomes:\n$$\n-RT \\ln(\\gamma_1 x_1) = V_{m,1} \\Pi\n$$\nFor a dilute solution, which is the regime of interest, we can make several justified approximations:\n1.  The solution behaves ideally, so the activity coefficient of the solvent approaches unity: $\\gamma_1 \\to 1$.\n2.  The mole fraction of the solute (polymer), $x_2$, is very small ($x_2 \\ll 1$). Thus, $x_1 = 1 - x_2$. The natural logarithm can be approximated by its Taylor series expansion, $\\ln(1-x_2) \\approx -x_2$ for small $x_2$.\n\nApplying these approximations, we get:\n$$\n-RT \\ln(1 - x_2) \\approx -RT(-x_2) = RT x_2 = V_{m,1} \\Pi\n$$\nThis is the van't Hoff equation. To express it in terms of concentration, we relate $x_2$ to experimentally accessible quantities. For a dilute solution, $x_2 = n_2 / (n_1 + n_2) \\approx n_2 / n_1$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the moles of solvent and solute, respectively.\nThe total volume of the solution is $V \\approx n_1 V_{m,1}$. Substituting these into the equation:\n$$\nRT \\frac{n_2}{n_1} \\approx V_{m,1} \\Pi \\implies RT \\frac{n_2}{n_1} \\approx \\frac{V}{n_1} \\Pi\n$$\nThis simplifies to $\\Pi V \\approx n_2 RT$, or $\\Pi \\approx (n_2/V)RT$. The term $n_2/V$ is the molar concentration of the solute, $C$. Thus, for an ideal dilute solution:\n$$\n\\Pi = CRT\n$$\nThe problem uses mass concentration $c$ (mass of solute per unit volume of solution). The molar concentration $C$ is related to $c$ and the number-average molar mass of the polymer, $M_n$, by $C = c/M_n$.\nSubstituting this, we obtain the leading-order dependence:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Pi}{RT} = \\frac{c}{M_n}\n$$\nFrom this relationship, it is clear that in the plot of $\\Pi/(RT)$ versus $c$, the initial slope, or the coefficient of the leading-order term in $c$, is $1/M_n$. This parameter carries the information about the number-average molar mass.\n\n**Part 2: Data Analysis and Molar Mass Estimation**\n\nFor non-ideal solutions, the relationship is expressed as a virial expansion in concentration. Truncating at the second order in $c$, the expansion is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Pi}{RT} = \\frac{1}{M_n}c + A_2' c^2\n$$\nwhere $A_2'$ is related to the second virial coefficient. This equation is not linear in $c$. To obtain a linear relationship for data fitting, we divide by $c$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Pi}{cRT} = \\frac{1}{M_n} + A_2' c\n$$\nThis is the equation of a straight line, $y = b + mx$, where $y = \\Pi/(cRT)$, $x = c$, the y-intercept $b$ is $1/M_n$, and the slope $m$ is $A_2'$. We can thus find $1/M_n$ by performing a linear regression on the provided data and extrapolating to $c=0$.\n\nLet's compute the values of $\\Pi/(cRT)$ for each data point:\n- For $c = 2$ g/L: $\\frac{\\Pi}{cRT} = \\frac{1.15911112 \\times 10^{-5}}{2} = 5.7955556 \\times 10^{-6}$ mol/g\n- For $c = 4$ g/L: $\\frac{\\Pi}{cRT} = \\frac{2.41422224 \\times 10^{-5}}{4} = 6.0355556 \\times 10^{-6}$ mol/g\n- For $c = 6$ g/L: $\\frac{\\Pi}{cRT} = \\frac{3.76533336 \\times 10^{-5}}{6} = 6.2755556 \\times 10^{-6}$ mol/g\n- For $c = 8$ g/L: $\\frac{\\Pi}{cRT} = \\frac{5.21244448 \\times 10^{-5}}{8} = 6.5155556 \\times 10^{-6}$ mol/g\n- For $c = 10$ g/L: $\\frac{\\Pi}{cRT} = \\frac{6.75555560 \\times 10^{-5}}{10} = 6.7555556 \\times 10^{-6}$ mol/g\n\nThe data for $(\\Pi/(cRT))$ vs. $c$ is perfectly linear. The slope, $A_2'$, can be calculated between any two points. For instance, between $c=2$ and $c=4$:\n$$\nA_2' = \\frac{(6.0355556 - 5.7955556) \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ mol/g}}{4 - 2 \\text{ g/L}} = \\frac{0.24 \\times 10^{-6}}{2} = 0.12 \\times 10^{-6} \\frac{\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{L}}{\\text{g}^2}\n$$\nThe intercept $1/M_n$ can be found by extrapolating the line to $c=0$. Using the first data point and the slope:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{M_n} = \\left(\\frac{\\Pi}{cRT}\\right)_{c=2} - A_2' \\times (2 \\text{ g/L})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{M_n} = 5.7955556 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ mol/g} - (0.12 \\times 10^{-6} \\frac{\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{L}}{\\text{g}^2}) \\times (2 \\text{ g/L})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{M_n} = 5.7955556 \\times 10^{-6} - 0.24 \\times 10^{-6} = 5.5555556 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ mol/g}\n$$\nThis value represents the coefficient of the leading-order term. Now, we calculate the number-average molar mass, $M_n$:\n$$\nM_n = \\frac{1}{5.5555556 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ mol/g}} = 180000 \\text{ g/mol}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as instructed:\n$$\nM_n = 1.80 \\times 10^5 \\text{ g/mol}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Sources of Error**\n\nIn a real laboratory setting, the estimated molar mass would be affected by several sources of error, including:\n1.  **Membrane Leakage**: The semipermeable membrane is not perfectly impermeable to all polymer molecules. Smaller molecules, which are invariably present in a polydisperse polymer sample, may permeate the membrane. This leads to a measured osmotic pressure that is lower than the true equilibrium value, as the effective solute concentration difference across the membrane is reduced. Since $M_n$ is inversely proportional to $\\Pi$, this results in an overestimation of the number-average molar mass.\n2.  **Inaccuracy of the Virial Model**: The analysis relies on a virial expansion truncated at the second-order term. If the concentration range is not sufficiently dilute, or if the polymer-solvent interactions are strong, higher-order terms (e.g., $A_3' c^3$) may be significant. Neglecting these terms introduces a systematic error, as the plot of $\\Pi/(cRT)$ versus $c$ would exhibit curvature, making the linear extrapolation to $c=0$ inaccurate.\n3.  **Experimental Errors in Concentration**: The calculation is highly sensitive to the accuracy of the mass concentration, $c$. Any errors in weighing the dry polymer or in measuring the final volume of the solution will propagate directly into the analysis. For instance, systematic absorption of atmospheric moisture by a hygroscopic polymer before weighing would lead to an artificially high value for the polymer mass, an inflated value of $c$, and consequently an erroneously high calculated molar mass.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.80 \\times 10^5}$$", "id": "2552561"}, {"introduction": "Colligative properties depend directly on the number of solute particles, a fact that becomes particularly interesting when solutes can reversibly associate or dissociate.

Assuming the solvent is incompressible, its molar volume $V_{m, \\text{solvent}}$ is constant. Integrating from $P$ to $P+\\Pi$ gives:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{solvent}}^{\\text{pure}}(P+\\Pi) - \\mu_{\\text{solvent}}^{\\text{pure}}(P) = V_{m, \\text{solvent}} \\Pi\n$$\nSubstituting this into the equilibrium equation yields:\n$$\n-V_{m, \\text{solvent}} \\Pi = RT \\ln x_{\\text{solvent}}\n$$\nFor a dilute solution, the total mole fraction of all solute species, $x_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_i x_i$, is small.

Derive from first principles a single ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $dV/dt$ that depends only on $V$, the parameters $(L_{p},R,T)$, the extracellular concentration $C_{e}$, and the conserved intracellular osmole amount $N_{i}$, together with the spherical relation for $A(V)$.\n2. Numerically integrate this ODE from $t=0$ to a specified final time $t_{\\mathrm{end}}$ for each test case, starting from $V(0)=V_{0}$ and with $N_{i}=C_{i,0} V_{0}$ determined by the given initial intracellular concentration $C_{i,0}$.\n3. Return the final volume $V(t_{\\mathrm{end}})$ for each test case as a floating-point number in $\\mathrm{m}^{3}$.\n\nPhysical units and formatting requirements:\n- All volumes must be expressed in $\\mathrm{m}^{3}$.\n- The gas constant is $R=8.314\\, \\mathrm{Pa}\\, \\mathrm{m}^{3}\\, \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\, \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n- Use absolute temperature $T$ in $\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Your program must output the final volumes using scientific notation with six significant digits, formatted as a single line containing a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example: $[1.234560\\mathrm{e}{-16},5.678900\\mathrm{e}{-17}]$.\n\nTest suite:\nFor each case, parameters are given as $(V_{0}, C_{i,0}, C_{e}, L_{p}, T, t_{\\mathrm{end}})$ with units $\\left(\\mathrm{m}^{3}, \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}, \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}, \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{s}\\right)$.\n\n- Case 1 (baseline dehydration):\n  - $(V_{0}, C_{i,0}, C_{e}, L_{p}, T, t_{\\mathrm{end}}) = (1.0\\times 10^{-16}, 300, 450, 1.0\\times 10^{-13}, 310, 60)$.\n- Case 2 (no osmotic change boundary):\n  - $(V_{0}, C_{i,0}, C_{e}, L_{p}, T, t_{\\mathrm{end}}) = (1.0\\times 10^{-16}, 300, 300, 1.0\\times 10^{-13}, 310, 60)$.\n- Case 3 (strong dehydration, long time to near steady state):\n  - $(V_{0}, C_{i,0}, C_{e}, L_{p}, T, t_{\\mathrm{end}}) = (1.0\\times 10^{-16}, 300, 1200, 1.0\\times 10^{-13}, 310, 600)$.\n- Case 4 (hypo-osmotic dilution leading to transient swelling; checks sign handling):\n  - $(V_{0}, C_{i,0}, C_{e}, L_{p}, T, t_{\\mathrm{end}}) = (1.0\\times 10^{-16}, 300, 240, 1.0\\times 10^{-13}, 310, 60)$.\n- Case 5 (reduced permeability slows dehydration):\n  - $(V_{0}, C_{i,0}, C_{e}, L_{p}, T, t_{\\mathrm{end}}) = (1.0\\times 10^{-16}, 300, 450, 1.0\\times 10^{-14}, 310, 60)$.\n\nNumerical and algorithmic requirements:\n- The ODE must be integrated with a method of at least fourth-order accuracy in time with adaptive or sufficiently small fixed time steps to ensure numerical stability and accuracy.\n- Ensure $V(t)$ remains strictly positive for all $t$ during integration by appropriate numerical safeguards if needed.\n- The final outputs must be the five values $V(t_{\\mathrm{end}})$ corresponding to the test cases, in the exact order listed, formatted as a single line containing a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, with each number in scientific notation with six significant digits (for example, $1.234560\\mathrm{e}{-16}$).

All required parameters and conditions are provided, and the problem is scientifically grounded, objective, and well-posed. We now proceed to the derivation and solution.\n\nThe rate of change of the cell volume, $dV/dt$, is equal to the net volumetric flow rate of water into the cell. If we define the outward flux per unit area as $J_v$, the volume change is given by the product of the cell's surface area, $A(t)$, and this flux, with a negative sign to indicate that an outward flux causes a decrease in volume:\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dt} = -A(t) J_v $$\nThe flux $J_v$ is described by the principles of Linear Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics. For a semi-permeable membrane with a reflection coefficient $\\sigma=1$ for the solute and negligible hydrostatic pressure difference ($\\Delta P=0$), the flux is driven by the osmotic pressure difference across the membrane. The standard relation for outward flux is:\n$$ J_v = L_p (\\Delta P - \\sigma \\Delta \\Pi) $$\nwhere $\\Delta P = P_i - P_e$ and $\\Delta \\Pi = \\Pi_i - \\Pi_e$. With the given assumptions, this simplifies to:\n$$ J_v = -L_p (\\Pi_i - \\Pi_e) = L_p ( \\Pi_e - \\Pi_i ) $$\nHere, $L_p$ is the membrane hydraulic permeability, and $\\Pi_e$ and $\\Pi_i$ are the extracellular and intracellular osmotic pressures, respectively. The form of this equation correctly indicates that a higher extracellular osmotic pressure ($\\Pi_e > \\Pi_i$) drives an outward flux of water ($J_v > 0$), causing the cell to shrink.\n\nCombining these gives the rate of volume change:\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dt} = -A(t) L_p (\\Pi_e - \\Pi_i(t)) $$\nThe osmotic pressures are given by the van't Hoff equation for ideal dilute solutions:\n$$ \\Pi = C R T $$\nwhere $C$ is the molar concentration of solutes, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The extracellular concentration $C_e$ is constant. The intracellular concentration $C_i(t)$ changes as the cell volume $V(t)$ changes:\n$$ C_i(t) = \\frac{N_i}{V(t)} $$\nThe total amount of intracellular impermeant solute, $N_i$, is conserved and is determined by the initial state of the cell: $N_i = C_{i,0}V_0$.\n\nThe cell is assumed to remain spherical at all times. Its surface area $A(t)$ is therefore related to its volume $V(t)$ as follows:\n$$ V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 \\implies r = \\left(\\frac{3V}{4\\pi}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n$$ A = 4\\pi r^2 = 4\\pi \\left(\\frac{3V}{4\\pi}\\right)^{2/3} = (4\\pi)^{1/3} (3)^{2/3} V^{2/3} = (36\\pi)^{1/3} V^{2/3} $$\nSubstituting all components—the expressions for $A(t)$, $\\Pi_e$, and $\\Pi_i(t)$—into the equation for $dV/dt$ yields the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dt} = -(36\\pi)^{1/3}V(t)^{2/3} \\cdot L_p \\cdot \\left(C_e R T - \\frac{N_i R T}{V(t)}\\right) $$\nThis can be rearranged for computational implementation:\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dt} = -L_p R T (36\\pi)^{1/3} V(t)^{2/3} \\left( C_e - \\frac{N_i}{V(t)} \\right) $$\nThis is a first-order, nonlinear, autonomous ODE for the cell volume $V(t)$.\n\nFor the numerical solution, this ODE is formulated as an initial value problem (IVP) with the initial condition $V(0)=V_0$. We employ a numerical integrator to solve this IVP over the time interval $[0, t_{\\text{end}}]$. The `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` function from the SciPy library is appropriate for this task. We select the 'RK45' method, which is an explicit Runge-Kutta method of order $5(4)$ with adaptive step-size control, thereby satisfying the problem's requirement for a method of at least fourth-order accuracy. A Python function representing the right-hand side of the ODE is implemented. This function, along with the initial condition $V(0)=V_0$ and the time span $[0, t_{\\text{end}}]$, is passed to the solver for each of the five test cases. The initial quantity of intracellular solutes, $N_i = C_{i,0}V_0$, is computed for each case before initiating the integration.\n\nThe problem statement contains a minor inconsistency regarding the output format, specifying 'six significant digits' while providing an example '1.234560e-16' which possesses seven significant digits. The implementation will adhere to the provided example, formatting the output to seven significant digits (one digit before the decimal and six digits after), using the format specifier `\"{:.6e}\"`. The final volume $V(t_{\\text{end}})$ is extracted for each case and reported as required.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and numerically solves the ODE for cell osmotic dehydration.\n    \n    The program calculates the final cell volume for several test cases based on\n    a model coupling water flux to osmotic pressure difference across the membrane\n    of a spherical cell.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Physical Constants\n    R = 8.314  # Gas constant in Pa m^3 mol^-1 K^-1\n\n    # Test cases are defined as tuples:\n    # (V0, Ci0, Ce, Lp, T, t_end)\n    # Units: (m^3, mol m^-3, mol m^-3, m Pa^-1 s^-1, K, s)\n    test_cases = [\n        (1.0e-16, 300, 450, 1.0e-13, 310, 60),\n        (1.0e-16, 300, 300, 1.0e-13, 310, 60),\n        (1.0e-16, 300, 1200, 1.0e-13, 310, 600),\n        (1.0e-16, 300, 240, 1.0e-13, 310, 60),\n        (1.0e-16, 300, 450, 1.0e-14, 310, 60),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    # Pre-calculate the geometric constant from A = (36*pi)^(1/3) * V^(2/3)\n    GEOMETRIC_CONST = (36 * np.pi)**(1/3)\n\n    def dV_dt(t, V, Lp, T, Ce, Ni):\n        \"\"\"\n        Defines the ordinary differential equation for the cell volume V.\n        dV/dt = -A(V) * Lp * (Pi_e - Pi_i(V))\n        \"\"\"\n        volume = V[0]\n        \n        # A minimal safeguard against non-physical volume resulting from numerical error.\n        # The equilibrium volume is positive for all test cases, so this should not be triggered.\n        if volume = 0:\n            return 0\n        \n        # Surface area of the spherical cell\n        surface_area = GEOMETRIC_CONST * volume**(2/3)\n        \n        # ODE: dV/dt = -Lp * R * T * A(V) * (Ce - Ni/V)\n        return -Lp * R * T * surface_area * (Ce - Ni / volume)\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        V0, Ci0, Ce, Lp, T, t_end = case\n        \n        # Calculate the constant amount of intracellular solutes from initial conditions\n        Ni = Ci0 * V0\n        \n        # Define the time span for integration\n        t_span = [0, t_end]\n        \n        # Define the initial condition as a list/array\n        V_initial = [V0]\n        \n        # Numerically integrate the ODE\n        # 'RK45' method is used, which is a 4th-5th order adaptive step-size integrator.\n        # 't_eval' requests the solution only at the specified final time point.\n        sol = solve_ivp(\n            fun=dV_dt,\n            t_span=t_span,\n            y0=V_initial,\n            args=(Lp, T, Ce, Ni),\n            method='RK45',\n            t_eval=[t_end]\n        )\n        \n        # Extract the final volume from the solution object\n        final_volume = sol.y[0, -1]\n        results.append(final_volume)\n\n    # Format the results to scientific notation with 6 digits after the decimal,\n    # following the example format (which has 7 significant digits).\n    formatted_results = [f\"{res:.6e}\" for res in results]\n    \n    # Print the final output in the required format\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2552526"}]}
