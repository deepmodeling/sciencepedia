The multiple-bond expansion convention.\n- The objective is to determine the descending priority order (highest to lowest) of these four substituents.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is assessed for validity.\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is based entirely on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules, which are the universally accepted convention in organic chemistry and biochemistry for specifying stereochemistry. The substituents are common biochemical functional groups. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The CIP rules are a deterministic algorithm designed to produce a unique, unambiguous priority ranking for any set of substituents. The question asks for this specific ranking, so a unique solution exists.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem uses precise chemical and procedural language ($\\mathrm{CH_2OH}$, $\\mathrm{CHO}$, $\\mathrm{CO_2H}$, $\\mathrm{H}$, Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules) and is free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Completeness:** The problem provides all necessary information—the set of substituents and the exact rules to apply—to arrive at a definitive answer.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a standard, well-posed exercise in applying fundamental principles of stereochemistry. The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe priority of the four substituents attached to the stereogenic center must be determined according to the Cahn–Ingold–Prelog (CIP) rules.\n\n**Rule 1: Priority Based on Atomic Number**\nThe priority is first assigned based on the atomic number of the atom directly bonded to the stereogenic center.\n- For the $\\mathrm{CH_2OH}$ group, the atom is Carbon (atomic number $Z=6$).\n- For the $\\mathrm{CHO}$ group, the atom is Carbon ($Z=6$).\n- For the $\\mathrm{CO_2H}$ group, the atom is Carbon ($Z=6$).\n- For the $\\mathrm{H}$ substituent, the atom is Hydrogen ($Z=1$).\n\nSince hydrogen has the lowest atomic number, the $\\mathrm{H}$ substituent is assigned the lowest priority, which is priority $4$. The remaining three substituents, all attached via a carbon atom, are tied. This tie must be broken by proceeding to the next rule.\n\n**Rule 2: First Point of Difference**\nTo resolve the tie among the three carbon-based substituents, we must inspect the set of atoms attached to each of these first carbon atoms. The atoms in each set are listed in descending order of their atomic numbers. For multiple bonds, we use the multiple-bond expansion convention, where a double bond $\\mathrm{A=B}$ is treated as $\\mathrm{A}$ being singly bonded to two $\\mathrm{B}$ atoms, and $\\mathrm{B}$ being singly bonded to two $\\mathrm{A}$ atoms.\n\n1.  **For the hydroxymethyl group ($-\\mathrm{CH_2OH}$):**\n    The carbon atom is singly bonded to one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms. The set of attached atoms, ordered by decreasing atomic number, is $(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{H})$.\n\n2.  **For the formyl group ($-\\mathrm{CHO}$):**\n    The carbon atom is singly bonded to one hydrogen atom and double-bonded to one oxygen atom. According to the multiple-bond expansion convention, the double bond $\\mathrm{C=O}$ is treated as the carbon being bonded to two oxygens. Therefore, the carbon atom of the formyl group is considered to be attached to one real oxygen, one \"phantom\" oxygen, and one hydrogen. The set of attached atoms is $(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{H})$.\n\n3.  **For the carboxyl group ($-\\mathrm{CO_2H}$):**\n    The carbon atom is singly bonded to one oxygen atom (of the $-\\mathrm{OH}$ moiety) and double-bonded to another oxygen atom. Using the multiple-bond expansion for the $\\mathrm{C=O}$ bond, this carbon is considered to be attached to the oxygen of the hydroxyl group, the oxygen of the carbonyl group, and a \"phantom\" oxygen from the expansion. Thus, the carbon is treated as being bonded to three oxygen atoms. The set of attached atoms is $(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{O})$.\n\nNow, we compare these three lists lexicographically:\n- $-\\mathrm{CO_2H}$: $(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{O})$\n- $-\\mathrm{CHO}$: $(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{H})$\n- $-\\mathrm{CH_2OH}$: $(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{H})$\n\n- **Comparison at the first position:** All three lists have an oxygen atom ($\\mathrm{O}$). This is a tie.\n- **Comparison at the second position:** The lists for $-\\mathrm{CO_2H}$ and $-\\mathrm{CHO}$ both have an oxygen atom ($\\mathrm{O}$), while the list for $-\\mathrm{CH_2OH}$ has a hydrogen atom ($\\mathrm{H}$). Since oxygen ($Z=8$) has a higher atomic number than hydrogen ($Z=1$), the $-\\mathrm{CH_2OH}$ group has the lowest priority among these three. Thus, $-\\mathrm{CH_2OH}$ is assigned priority $3$.\n- **Comparison at the third position:** We now only need to compare $-\\mathrm{CO_2H}$ and $-\\mathrm{CHO}$. Their lists are $(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{O})$ and $(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{H})$, respectively. The first and second positions are tied. At the third position, the list for $-\\mathrm{CO_2H}$ has an oxygen atom ($\\mathrm{O}$), while the list for $-\\mathrm{CHO}$ has a hydrogen atom ($\\mathrm{H}$). Since oxygen has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, the $-\\mathrm{CO_2H}$ group has higher priority than the $-\\mathrm{CHO}$ group.\n\nTherefore, $-\\mathrm{CO_2H}$ is assigned priority $1$, and $-\\mathrm{CHO}$ is assigned priority $2$.\n\nThe final descending priority order is:\nPriority 1: $-\\mathrm{CO_2H}$\nPriority 2: $-\\mathrm{CHO}$\nPriority 3: $-\\mathrm{CH_2OH}$\nPriority 4: $-\\mathrm{H}$\n\nThis corresponds to the ordering: $\\mathrm{CO_2H} > \\mathrm{CHO} > \\mathrm{CH_2OH} > \\mathrm{H}$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n- **A. $\\mathrm{CO_2H} > \\mathrm{CHO} > \\mathrm{CH_2OH} > \\mathrm{H}$**: This order matches the one derived from a rigorous application of the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules. The carboxyl group has the highest priority due to its $(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{O})$ connectivity. The formyl group is second due to its $(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{H})$ connectivity. The hydroxymethyl group is third with its $(\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{H})$ connectivity, and hydrogen is last. **Correct**.\n\n- **B. $\\mathrm{CHO} > \\mathrm{CO_2H} > \\mathrm{CH_2OH} > \\mathrm{H}$**: This is incorrect. It erroneously prioritizes the formyl group over the carboxyl group. This would result from an incorrect comparison at the third atom in the connectivity lists, confusing $\\mathrm{H}$ for being higher priority than $\\mathrm{O}$. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **C. $\\mathrm{CO_2H} > \\mathrm{CH_2OH} > \\mathrm{CHO} > \\mathrm{H}$**: This is incorrect. It fails to correctly compare the formyl and hydroxymethyl groups. It ignores the second atom in the connectivity lists, where the formyl group's oxygen atom gives it priority over the hydroxymethyl group's hydrogen atom. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D. $\\mathrm{CH_2OH} > \\mathrm{CHO} > \\mathrm{CO_2H} > \\mathrm{H}$**: This is incorrect. The priority order for the three carbon-based substituents is completely reversed. Such an error implies a fundamental misunderstanding of the CIP rules. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **E. $\\mathrm{CHO} > \\mathrm{CH_2OH} > \\mathrm{CO_2H} > \\mathrm{H}$**: This is incorrect. The assigned priority order is inconsistent with any logical application of the CIP rules. It incorrectly places the carboxyl group as the lowest priority among the carbon-based groups. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2607893"}, {"introduction": "While a single stereocenter gives rise to a pair of enantiomers, many biomolecules contain multiple stereocenters, leading to a complex family of diastereomers and enantiomers.

The first requires the derivation of a general formula under idealized conditions, and the second requires the application of stereochemical principles to a specific, real molecule where those ideal conditions are not met.\n\nTask 1: General Expression for the Number of Stereoisomers\n\nA stereocenter is defined as a chiral center. By its nature, such a center can exist in exactly two distinct spatial configurations, which are mirror images of each other. These configurations are conventionally labeled $R$ (from Latin *rectus*) and $S$ (from Latin *sinister*).\n\nThe problem posits a molecule with $n$ such stereocenters. A critical given is that these stereocenters are independent, meaning the configuration at any one center does not constrain or influence the configuration at any other center. We are also told to assume no molecular symmetry that would render two different combinations of configurations identical.\n\nThis is a straightforward problem in combinatorics. We have $n$ independent positions (the stereocenters). For each position, there are $2$ possible choices of state (the $R$ or $S$ configuration).\n\nAccording to the fundamental principle of counting (the rule of product), if there are $n$ independent events, and the $i$-th event has $k_i$ possible outcomes, then the total number of possible outcomes for the sequence of events is the product $\\prod_{i=1}^{n} k_i$.\n\nIn our case, we have $n$ events (choosing the configuration for each stereocenter), and for each event $i$, the number of outcomes $k_i$ is $2$.\nTherefore, the total number of possible combinations of configurations is:\n$$ \\underbrace{2 \\times 2 \\times \\dots \\times 2}_{n \\text{ times}} = 2^n $$\nThe final condition, that there is no symmetry causing superimposition, ensures that each of these $2^n$ mathematical combinations corresponds to a physically distinct, unique stereoisomer. For instance, the diastereomers $(R,S)$ and $(S,R)$ in a molecule without a symmetric backbone are indeed different compounds.\n\nThus, the general expression for the theoretical maximum number of distinct stereoisomers for a molecule with $n$ independent stereocenters and no confounding symmetry is $2^n$.\n\nTask 2: Analysis of Tartaric Acid\n\nWe are given the molecule $\\mathrm{HOOC-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-COOH}$, which is $2,3$-dihydroxybutanedioic acid, or tartaric acid.\n\nFirst, we identify the stereocenters. The carbon atoms at positions $2$ and $3$ are each bonded to four distinct groups: $-\\mathrm{H}$, $-\\mathrm{OH}$, $-\\mathrm{COOH}$, and the $-\\mathrm{CH(OH)COOH}$ moiety. Therefore, both $C_2$ and $C_3$ are stereocenters, and $n=2$.\n\nA naive application of the $2^n$ rule derived in Task $1$ would predict $2^2 = 4$ stereoisomers. However, this rule is valid only in the absence of internal molecular symmetry. Tartaric acid is of the form $\\mathrm{X-Y-Y-X}$, where the two terminal groups $\\mathrm{X}$ are identical ($-\\mathrm{COOH}$). This structure is symmetric, which violates the premise of Task $1$. We must therefore analyze the specific stereochemical consequences of this symmetry.\n\nThe four possible combinations of configurations for the $(C_2, C_3)$ pair are:\n1. $(2R, 3R)$\n2. $(2S, 3S)$\n3. $(2R, 3S)$\n4. $(2S, 3R)$\n\nLet us examine each case:\nThe $(2R, 3R)$-tartaric acid molecule is chiral; it does not possess an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\nThe $(2S, 3S)$-tartaric acid is the mirror image of the $(2R, 3R)$ form. Because the $(2R, 3R)$ form is chiral, it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, $(2R, 3R)$-tartaric acid and $(2S, 3S)$-tartaric acid are a pair of enantiomers. These are two distinct compounds.\n\nNow, consider the $(2R, 3S)$ configuration. Due to the symmetrical nature of the carbon backbone, a molecule with this configuration possesses an internal plane of symmetry ($\\sigma$) that bisects the $C_2-C_3$ bond. The $C_2$ half of the molecule is the mirror image of the $C_3$ half. A compound that contains stereocenters but is itself achiral due to such an internal symmetry element is defined as a meso compound. By definition, a meso compound is superimposable on its mirror image.\n\nThe mirror image of the $(2R, 3S)$ configuration is $(2S, 3R)$. Since the $(2R, 3S)$ molecule is achiral (meso), it must be identical to its mirror image. Thus, the $(2R, 3S)$ and $(2S, 3R)$ designations do not represent an enantiomeric pair; they describe the very same achiral molecule. This can be confirmed by noting that a $180^\\circ$ rotation of the $(2R, 3S)$ molecule in the plane of a Fischer projection, followed by relabeling of the atoms, yields the $(2S, 3R)$ structure. Such a rotation does not change the identity of the molecule.\n\nIn summary, the distinct stereoisomers of tartaric acid are:\n- $(2R, 3R)$-tartaric acid (chiral)\n- $(2S, 3S)$-tartaric acid (chiral, the enantiomer of the first)\n- meso-tartaric acid (achiral, corresponding to both $(2R, 3S)$ and $(2S, 3R)$ configurations)\n\nCounting these distinct chemical entities, we find there is one enantiomeric pair (which consists of $2$ molecules) and one meso compound. The total is $2 + 1 = 3$.\nThe stereoisomers $(2R, 3R)$ and meso-tartaric acid are diastereomers, as are $(2S, 3S)$ and meso-tartaric acid.\n\nThe total number of distinct stereoisomers for tartaric acid is $3$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2^n & 3 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2607928"}, {"introduction": "Stereochemistry is not merely a structural descriptor; it has profound energetic and kinetic consequences, particularly in enzyme catalysis.
