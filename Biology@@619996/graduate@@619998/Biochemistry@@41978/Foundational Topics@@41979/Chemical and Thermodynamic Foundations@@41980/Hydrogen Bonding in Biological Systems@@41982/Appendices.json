In the context of biomolecular structures, \"preorganization\" refers to the principle that a binding site or a folding protein is structured such that its interacting groups are already positioned in optimal geometric configurations before the binding or folding event. The strong energetic penalty for misalignment, as quantified by this ratio, enforces extreme structural specificity. Only substrates or conformers that match the preorganized geometry with high precision can form strong, stabilizing interactions. This principle is fundamental to the high fidelity of molecular recognition, enzyme catalysis, and the formation of unique, stable protein tertiary and quaternary structures.

The four necessary constructs are precisely those for which data are provided:\n$1$. The wild-type protein binding to the wild-type ligand: ($\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}}, \\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$). This is the reference system where the hydrogen bond is intact.\n$2$. The mutant protein (acceptor removed) binding to the wild-type ligand: ($\\mathrm{P}^{\\ast}, \\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$). This system measures the energetic cost of removing the protein's acceptor.\n$3$. The wild-type protein binding to the mutant ligand (donor removed): ($\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}}, \\mathrm{L}^{\\ast}$). This system measures the energetic cost of removing the ligand's donor.\n$4$. The mutant protein binding to the mutant ligand: ($\\mathrm{P}^{\\ast}, \\mathrm{L}^{\\ast}$). This system measures the \"intrinsic\" binding affinity in the absence of both interacting groups.\n\nThe single thermodynamic measurement to be made on each of these four constructs is the standard Gibbs free energy of binding, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}$. As stated in the problem, a method such as Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) is suitable for this purpose, as it can directly yield the association constant $K_a$, from which $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}$ is calculated via the relation $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}} = -RT\\ln K_{a}$. The problem specifies that the wild-type/wild-type system, ($\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}}, \\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$), serves as the reference against which the effects of the mutations are assessed.\n\nThe core principle for calculating the coupling energy is that the Gibbs free energy is a state function. This allows us to construct a thermodynamic cycle where the net change in free energy around the cycle is zero. The cycle connects the four binding equilibria:\n\n$$\n\\begin{CD}\n\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}} \\cdot \\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}} @>{\\Delta G_{L|P_{WT}}}>> \\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}} \\cdot \\mathrm{L}^{\\ast} \\\\\n@V{\\Delta G_{P|L_{WT}}}VV @VV{\\Delta G_{P|L_{mut}}}V \\\\\n\\mathrm{P}^{\\ast} \\cdot \\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}} @>>{\\Delta G_{L|P_{mut}}}> \\mathrm{P}^{\\ast} \\cdot \\mathrm{L}^{\\ast}\n\\end{CD}\n$$\n\nHere, the states are the protein-ligand complexes, and the arrows represent the free energy changes associated with mutating one component while the other is held constant. For example, $\\Delta G_{L|P_{WT}}$ is the change in binding free energy upon mutating the ligand ($\\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{L}^{\\ast}$) while it is bound to the wild-type protein ($\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$).\n\nThe coupling free energy, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coupling}}$, is the measure of non-additivity. It quantifies how the energetic effect of one mutation is altered by the presence of the other mutation. Mathematically, it is the difference between the effect of a mutation in the wild-type background and its effect in the mutant background.\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coupling}} = \\Delta G_{L|P_{mut}} - \\Delta G_{L|P_{WT}} $$\nThe individual free energy changes, representing the horizontal arrows in the diagram, are calculated from the measured binding free energies:\n$$ \\Delta G_{L|P_{WT}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}},\\mathrm{L}^{\\ast}) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}},\\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}}) $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{L|P_{mut}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\ast},\\mathrm{L}^{\\ast}) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\ast},\\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}}) $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coupling}}$ yields:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coupling}} = \\left( \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\ast},\\mathrm{L}^{\\ast}) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\ast},\\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}}) \\right) - \\left( \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}},\\mathrm{L}^{\\ast}) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}},\\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}}) \\right) $$\nRearranging this expression gives the standard formula for coupling energy:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coupling}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}},\\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}}) + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\ast},\\mathrm{L}^{\\ast}) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\ast},\\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}}) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}},\\mathrm{L}^{\\ast}) $$\nNote that due to the cyclic nature of the state function, the same result is obtained by considering the vertical mutations: $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coupling}} = \\Delta G_{P|L_{mut}} - \\Delta G_{P|L_{WT}}$. This is the mathematical embodiment of the validity of the cycle.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into the derived equation. All values are in units of $\\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$.\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}},\\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}}) = -9.0 $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\ast},\\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}}) = -7.5 $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}},\\mathrm{L}^{\\ast}) = -7.0 $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\ast},\\mathrm{L}^{\\ast}) = -6.0 $$\nThe calculation is as follows:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coupling}} = (-9.0) + (-6.0) - (-7.5) - (-7.0) $$\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coupling}} = -9.0 - 6.0 + 7.5 + 7.0 $$\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coupling}} = -15.0 + 14.5 $$\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coupling}} = -0.5 $$\nThe coupling free energy attributable to the hydrogen bond is $-0.5 \\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$. The negative sign signifies that the interaction is favorable, or stabilizing, as expected for a hydrogen bond. The magnitude represents the net energetic contribution from this specific interaction, accounting for all thermodynamic consequences of its formation, including changes in solvation and local structure, within the context of the overall binding event.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.5}$$", "id": "2571309"}]}
