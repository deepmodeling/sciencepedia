You are asked to compute the shift in its acid dissociation constant when it is buried near a lysine side chain and to explain the physical origin of the shift using first principles.\n\nConsider the deprotonation reaction of the aspartate side chain, $\\mathrm{HA} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{A}^{-} + \\mathrm{H}^{+}$. In bulk water at standard state for protons, the intrinsic aqueous value is $\\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{a,\\,water}} = 3.90$ at temperature $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$.

It presents a standard exercise in physical biochemistry using a simplified continuum electrostatic model. All necessary parameters and constants are provided. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe task is to compute the shift in the acid dissociation constant, $\\Delta \\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{a}}$, for an aspartate residue when it is transferred from bulk water to the interior of a protein where it is in proximity to a positively charged lysine residue.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the $\\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{a}}$ and the standard Gibbs free energy of deprotonation, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{deprot}}$. The acid dissociation constant, $K_{\\mathrm{a}}$, is related to $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{deprot}}$ by the fundamental thermodynamic equation:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{deprot}} = -RT \\ln K_{\\mathrm{a}}\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The $\\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{a}}$ is defined as $\\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{a}} = -\\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{a}}$. Using the change of base formula for logarithms, $\\ln x = (\\ln 10) (\\log_{10} x)$, we can rewrite the free energy equation as:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{deprot}} = -RT (\\ln 10) \\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{a}} = (RT \\ln 10) \\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{a}}\n$$\nThis gives a direct proportionality between $\\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{a}}$ and $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{deprot}}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{a}} = \\frac{\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{deprot}}}{RT \\ln 10}\n$$\nThe shift in $\\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{a}}$, $\\Delta \\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{a}}$, is defined as the difference between the $\\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{a}}$ in the protein environment and in bulk water:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{a}} \\equiv \\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{a,\\,protein}} - \\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{a,\\,water}} = \\frac{\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{deprot, protein}} - \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{deprot, water}}}{RT \\ln 10}\n$$\nWe define the change in the standard deprotonation free energy upon transferring the system from water to the protein as $\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{deprot}} = \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{deprot, protein}} - \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{deprot, water}}$. Thus, the expression for the $\\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{a}}$ shift is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{a}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{deprot}}}{RT \\ln 10}\n$$\nNext, we must model $\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{deprot}}$. The deprotonation reaction is $\\mathrm{HA} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{A}^{-} + \\mathrm{H}^{+}$. The change in standard free energy for this reaction is $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{deprot}} = G^{\\circ}(\\mathrm{A}^{-}) + G^{\\circ}(\\mathrm{H}^{+}) - G^{\\circ}(\\mathrm{HA})$. The term $\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{deprot}}$ represents the change in this quantity when the process is moved from water to the protein. The standard state for protons is defined in bulk water for both cases, so the free energy term for $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$, $G^{\\circ}(\\mathrm{H}^{+})$, cancels out. The problem states that the protonated form, $\\mathrm{HA}$, is electrically neutral, so its electrostatic contribution to the transfer free energy is zero within this model, i.e., $G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{prot}}(\\mathrm{HA}) \\approx G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{water}}(\\mathrm{HA})$. Therefore, $\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{deprot}}$ is dominated by the change in the free energy of the charged, deprotonated state, $\\mathrm{A}^{-}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{deprot}} \\approx G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{prot}}(\\mathrm{A}^{-}) - G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{water}}(\\mathrm{A}^{-})\n$$\nThis free energy difference is modeled as the sum of two terms: a desolvation penalty (Born energy) and a Coulombic interaction.\n\n1.  The Born desolvation term, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born}}$, is the electrostatic self-energy change of the aspartate anion $\\mathrm{A}^{-}$ (modeled as a sphere of radius $a_{\\mathrm{A}}$ with charge $q = -e$) when transferred from a medium of high relative permittivity (water, $\\varepsilon_{w}$) to one of low relative permittivity (protein, $\\varepsilon_{p}$).\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born}} = \\frac{N_{A} q^{2}}{8 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} a_{\\mathrm{A}}} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{p}} - \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{w}} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $N_{A}$ is Avogadro's number and $\\varepsilon_{0}$ is the permittivity of free space.

The Coulombic interaction term, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Coulomb}}$, is the electrostatic potential energy between the aspartate anion ($\\mathrm{A}^{-}$, charge $q_{1} = -e$) and the nearby lysine cation ($\\mathrm{LysH}^{+}$, charge $q_{2} = +e$) at a separation distance $r$ within the protein medium ($\\varepsilon_{p}$). This interaction is absent in the reference state (infinitely separated in water).\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Coulomb}} = \\frac{N_{A} q_{1} q_{2}}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} \\varepsilon_{p} r} = \\frac{N_{A} (-e)(+e)}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} \\varepsilon_{p} r} = -\\frac{C}{\\varepsilon_{p} r}\n$$\nThe total free energy change is the sum of these two contributions:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{deprot}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born}} + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Coulomb}} = \\frac{C}{2 a_{\\mathrm{A}}} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{p}} - \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{w}} \\right) - \\frac{C}{\\varepsilon_{p} r}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into these expressions.

The hydrogen-bond-focused double mutant cycle yields a coupling free energy of approximately $-2.7\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$, indicating a favorable, context-dependent interaction between the tyrosine hydroxyl and the glutamate side chain under these solution conditions.**\nMy calculation yielded $\\Delta\\Delta G_{int, H-bond} \\approx -2.72\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$. The value in the statement is an excellent approximation. A negative coupling free energy signifies a favorable interaction between the mutated groups (the Tyr hydroxyl and the Glu carboxylate) in the wild-type complex. The loss of binding affinity upon creating the double mutant is less than the sum of the losses from the two single mutations, which is the signature of a stabilizing interaction. The interpretation is correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The hydrophobic-packing-focused double mutant cycle yields a coupling free energy of approximately $-1.0\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$, consistent with modest cooperative packing beyond additivity of the single alanine substitutions.**\nMy calculation yielded $\\Delta\\Delta G_{int, hydrophobic} \\approx -0.90\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$. The value of $-1.0\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$ is a reasonable approximation. The negative sign indicates a favorable interaction between the parts of the leucine and isoleucine side chains that are truncated in the alanine mutations. This is consistent with cooperative hydrophobic packing. The magnitude is small, so describing it as \"modest\" is appropriate.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Because double mutant cycles isolate pairwise interactions, the resulting coupling free energies can be taken as absolute, transferable “hydrogen bond energy” and “hydrophobic energy” that are independent of the protein environment and solvent.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The coupling free energy, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{int}$, is an effective energy measured *in situ*. It is highly dependent on the specific structural context of the interaction, including the precise geometry of the interacting groups, the surrounding protein matrix, and effects of solvent reorganization upon binding and mutation. It is a measure of interaction *in context*, not an absolute or transferable physical constant like a covalent bond dissociation energy in the gas phase. This statement demonstrates a grave misunderstanding of the method.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The Tyr$\\rightarrow$Phe and Glu$\\rightarrow$Gln substitutions are reasonable choices to target the hydrogen bond while approximately preserving nonpolar shape; however, the apparent coupling can depend on protonation state and pH (for example, the $pK_a$ values of tyrosine and glutamate and any microenvironment shifts), so pH control and, ideally, pH-dependence measurements are important.**\nThis statement is entirely correct. The chosen mutations are standard for this purpose: $Tyr \\rightarrow Phe$ removes the hydrogen-bond-donating hydroxyl group with minimal steric change; $Glu \\rightarrow Gln$ neutralizes the charge and alters the hydrogen bonding pattern of the carboxylate headgroup, also with minimal steric perturbation. The second part of the statement correctly identifies a crucial experimental variable. The interaction between Tyr and Glu depends on their protonation states, which are governed by their respective $pK_a$ values and the solution pH. Since $pK_a$ values can be strongly perturbed by the local protein environment, careful control of pH and, for a truly rigorous study, measurement of the pH-dependence of binding are essential. This reflects a proper, cautious scientific approach.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. Measuring only equilibrium $K_d$ values at a single temperature is sufficient to decompose the interaction into enthalpic (hydrogen bond) versus entropic (hydrophobic) components without ambiguity.**\nThis statement is thermodynamically false. The binding free energy is given by $\\Delta G^\\circ = \\Delta H^\\circ - T\\Delta S^\\circ$. A single measurement of $K_d$ at one temperature $T$ yields only one value, $\\Delta G^\\circ$. It is impossible to solve one equation for two unknowns ($\\Delta H^\\circ$ and $\\Delta S^\\circ$). To separate the enthalpic and entropic contributions, one must either measure $K_d$ at several different temperatures and use the van't Hoff equation, or use a method like ITC that directly measures $\\Delta H^\\circ$ in a single experiment. The problem gives only $K_d$ values, and the statement explicitly limits the available data to \"only equilibrium $K_d$ values at a single temperature\".\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**F. If any mutation substantially destabilizes either monomer by, for example, more than $8\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$, the observed changes in binding free energy can conflate folding and binding; therefore, independent stability measurements of the isolated proteins are necessary to validate the interpretation of the double mutant cycles.**\nThis statement addresses a critical prerequisite for the validity of any binding analysis involving mutations. The thermodynamic model used to interpret $K_d$ assumes that the observed protein concentrations correspond to the folded, binding-competent state. If a mutation affects the folding stability ($\\Delta G_{folding}$) of a monomer, it changes the concentration of the species available for binding. This change in the population of the folded state will alter the apparent $K_d$, confounding the interpretation. The effect on binding affinity would not be solely due to the change at the protein-protein interface.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information. I will now proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three parts: calculation of thermodynamic state functions, qualitative analysis of experimental effects, and evaluation of the given options.\n\n1.  **Calculation of Standard Free Energy Change ($\\Delta G^\\circ$)**\n     The standard free energy change of binding, $\\Delta G^\\circ$, is related to the equilibrium association constant, $K_{\\mathrm{a}}$, by the fundamental equation:\n    $$ \\Delta G^\\circ = -RT \\ln K_{\\mathrm{a}} $$\n    where $R$ is the gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The association constant $K_{\\mathrm{a}}$ is the reciprocal of the dissociation constant $K_{\\mathrm{d}}$: $K_{\\mathrm{a}} = 1/K_{\\mathrm{d}}$. Therefore, the equation can be written in terms of $K_{\\mathrm{d}}$:\n    $$ \\Delta G^\\circ = -RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{K_{\\mathrm{d}}}\\right) = RT \\ln K_{\\mathrm{d}} $$\n    The value of the gas constant is $R \\approx 1.987\\ \\mathrm{cal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$. The given values are $T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$ and $K_{\\mathrm{d}} = 200\\ \\mathrm{nM} = 200 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{M}$.\n    $$ \\Delta G^\\circ = (1.987\\ \\mathrm{cal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1})(298\\ \\mathrm{K}) \\ln(200 \\times 10^{-9}) $$\n    $$ \\Delta G^\\circ \\approx (592.13\\ \\mathrm{cal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}) \\times (-15.425) \\approx -9133\\ \\mathrm{cal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} $$\n    Converting to $\\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$:\n    $$ \\Delta G^\\circ \\approx -9.13\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} $$\n\n2.  **Calculation of Intrinsic Standard Enthalpy Change ($\\Delta H^\\circ$)**\n    The observed enthalpy change, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, in a buffered solution is the sum of the intrinsic enthalpy of binding, $\\Delta H^\\circ$, and the enthalpy contribution from the buffer due to proton exchange. The relationship is:\n    $$ \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\Delta H^\\circ + n_{\\mathrm{H}} \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ion}} $$\n    Here, $n_{\\mathrm{H}}$ is the number of moles of protons taken up by the protein-ligand system per mole of complex formed, and $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ion}}$ is the molar enthalpy of ionization (deprotonation) of the buffer. The problem states $n_{\\mathrm{H}} = +0.30$ (proton uptake) and $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ion}}(\\mathrm{Tris}) = +11.3\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n    To find the intrinsic enthalpy $\\Delta H^\\circ$, we rearrange the equation:\n    $$ \\Delta H^\\circ = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{obs}} - n_{\\mathrm{H}} \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ion}} $$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$ \\Delta H^\\circ = -6.00\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} - (0.30) \\times (+11.3\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}) $$\n    $$ \\Delta H^\\circ = -6.00\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} - 3.39\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} $$\n    $$ \\Delta H^\\circ = -9.39\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} $$\n\n3.  **Calculation of Standard Entropy Change ($\\Delta S^\\circ$)**\n    The standard entropy change, $\\Delta S^\\circ$, is determined from the Gibbs free energy equation, using the intrinsic enthalpy $\\Delta H^\\circ$:\n    $$ \\Delta G^\\circ = \\Delta H^\\circ - T\\Delta S^\\circ $$\n    Rearranging for $\\Delta S^\\circ$:\n    $$ \\Delta S^\\circ = \\frac{\\Delta H^\\circ - \\Delta G^\\circ}{T} $$\n    Using the calculated values for $\\Delta H^\\circ$ and $\\Delta G^\\circ$:\n    $$ \\Delta S^\\circ = \\frac{(-9.39\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}) - (-9.13\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1})}{298\\ \\mathrm{K}} $$\n    $$ \\Delta S^\\circ = \\frac{-0.26\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}}{298\\ \\mathrm{K}} \\approx -0.000872\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1} $$\n    Converting to $\\mathrm{cal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$:\n    $$ \\Delta S^\\circ \\approx -0.87\\ \\mathrm{cal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1} $$\n\n4.  **Qualitative Analysis**\n    -   **Effect of Baseline Offset**: An ITC isotherm is a plot of heat per injection versus molar ratio. The shape of the curve is determined by $K_{\\mathrm{d}}$ (via the parameter $c = K_a [P]$), while the total vertical displacement from initial to final injections is proportional to the product of stoichiometry ($n$) and molar enthalpy ($\\Delta H$). A small, constant heat offset added to every injection will shift the entire dataset vertically. In a nonlinear least-squares fit without a baseline offset parameter, this shift will be absorbed primarily by the parameter that controls the vertical scale, which is $\\Delta H$. The curvature and the inflection point, which are the main determinants of $K_{\\mathrm{d}}$ and $n$ respectively, are less sensitive to a simple vertical shift. Therefore, a constant offset primarily biases the fitted $\\Delta H$ value, with a potential minor effect on $n$, but the effect on $K_{\\mathrm{d}}$ is expected to be negligible.\n    -   **Effect of Buffer Ionization**: The relation is $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\Delta H^\\circ + n_{\\mathrm{H}} \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ion}}$. Given that $n_{\\mathrm{H}} = +0.30  0$ and $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ion}}(\\mathrm{Tris}) = +11.3\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}  0$, the product $n_{\\mathrm{H}} \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ion}}$ is a positive quantity ($+3.39\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$). This means $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\Delta H^\\circ + (\\text{a positive value})$. Consequently, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ will be more positive (less negative) than $\\Delta H^\\circ$. In this specific case, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{obs}} = -6.00\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ is indeed less exothermic than $\\Delta H^\\circ = -9.39\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n\nNow, I will evaluate each option.\n\nA. $\\Delta H^\\circ = -9.39\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$; $\\Delta G^\\circ = -9.13\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$; $\\Delta S^\\circ = -0.87\\ \\mathrm{cal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$; a constant per-injection baseline offset primarily biases the fitted $\\Delta H^\\circ$ (and possibly the stoichiometry) but has negligible effect on $K$; $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ion}}(\\mathrm{buffer})  0$ with $n_{\\mathrm{H}}  0$ makes the observed enthalpy less exothermic than the intrinsic enthalpy.\n-   The calculated thermodynamic values are all correct: $\\Delta H^\\circ = -9.39\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, $\\Delta G^\\circ = -9.13\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, and $\\Delta S^\\circ = -0.87\\ \\mathrm{cal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n-   The qualitative analysis of the baseline offset is correct.\n-   The qualitative analysis of the buffer ionization effect is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. $\\Delta H^\\circ = -2.61\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$; $\\Delta G^\\circ = -9.13\\ \\mathrm{kcal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$; $\\Delta S^\\circ = +21.9\\ \\mathrm{cal}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$; a constant per-injection baseline offset inflates the fitted $K$; $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ion}}(\\mathrm{buffer})  0$ with $n_{\\mathrm{H}}  0$ makes the observed enthalpy more exothermic than the intrinsic enthalpy.\n-   The value for $\\Delta H^\\circ$ is incorrect.
