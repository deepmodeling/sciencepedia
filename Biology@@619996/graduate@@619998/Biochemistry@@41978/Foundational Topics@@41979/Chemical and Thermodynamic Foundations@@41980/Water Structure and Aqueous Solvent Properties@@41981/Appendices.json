Therefore, we proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe autoprotolysis of water is the equilibrium reaction in which two water molecules react to form a hydronium ion and a hydroxide ion:\n$$2\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}(l) \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{H}_3\\mathrm{O}^+(aq) + \\mathrm{OH}^-(aq)$$\nThe equilibrium expression for this reaction, under the assumption that the activity of the pure liquid solvent, water, is approximately unity ($a_{\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}} \\approx 1$), is given by the ionic product of water, $K_w$. This constant is temperature-dependent, written as $K_w(T)$.\n$$K_w(T) = a_{\\mathrm{H}_3\\mathrm{O}^+} \\cdot a_{\\mathrm{OH}^-}$$\nThe problem states to assume ideal behavior, where the activities ($a_i$) of the solutes are equal to their molar concentrations ($[i]$). Thus, the expression becomes:\n$$K_w(T) = [\\mathrm{H}_3\\mathrm{O}^+][\\mathrm{OH}^-]$$\nFor pure water, the solution is neutral. By definition, a neutral aqueous solution is one where the concentration of hydronium ions is equal to the concentration of hydroxide ions, a direct consequence of the reaction stoichiometry.\n$$[\\mathrm{H}_3\\mathrm{O}^+] = [\\mathrm{OH}^-]$$\nSubstituting this condition of neutrality into the expression for $K_w(T)$:\n$$K_w(T) = [\\mathrm{H}_3\\mathrm{O}^+][\\mathrm{H}_3\\mathrm{O}^+] = [\\mathrm{H}_3\\mathrm{O}^+]^2$$\nWe can solve for the hydronium ion concentration in neutral water:\n$$[\\mathrm{H}_3\\mathrm{O}^+]_{\\text{neutral}} = \\sqrt{K_w(T)} = K_w(T)^{1/2}$$\nThe $\\mathrm{pH}$ is defined as the negative base-$10$ logarithm of the hydronium ion activity, which for an ideal solution is its concentration:\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H}_3\\mathrm{O}^+])$$\nSubstituting the expression for $[\\mathrm{H}_3\\mathrm{O}^+]_{\\text{neutral}}$ into the $\\mathrm{pH}$ definition gives the $\\mathrm{pH}$ of neutral water:\n$$\\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{neutral}} = -\\log_{10}(K_w(T)^{1/2})$$\nUsing the logarithmic identity $\\log(x^y) = y \\log(x)$, this simplifies to:\n$$\\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{neutral}} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\log_{10}(K_w(T))$$\nThe problem defines $pK_w(T) \\equiv -\\log_{10}(K_w(T))$. Substituting this definition into our expression for neutral $\\mathrm{pH}$ yields the general expression requested.\n$$\\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{neutral}}(T) = \\frac{1}{2} pK_w(T)$$\nThis is the required general derivation.\n\nNext, we compute the neutral $\\mathrm{pH}$ at the specified temperatures using the provided data.\nAt $T_1 = 25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, the given value is $pK_w(25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) = 14.000$.\n$$\\mathrm{pH}_{25} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 14.000 = 7.000$$\nAt $T_2 = 37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, the given value is $pK_w(37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) = 13.62$.\n$$\\mathrm{pH}_{37} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 13.62 = 6.81$$\nThe change in $\\mathrm{pH}$, $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$, is defined as $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH} \\equiv \\mathrm{pH}_{37} - \\mathrm{pH}_{25}$.\n$$\\Delta \\mathrm{pH} = 6.81 - 7.000 = -0.19$$\nThe problem requires this result rounded to $3$ significant figures. To express $-0.19$ with three significant figures, we must add a trailing zero.\n$$\\Delta \\mathrm{pH} = -0.190$$\n\nFinally, the explanation for the biochemical relevance. The autoprotolysis of water is an endothermic process ($\\Delta H^\\circ > 0$). This is evident from the provided data: as the temperature increases from $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, the value of $pK_w$ decreases from $14.000$ to $13.62$. A decrease in $pK_w$ signifies an increase in $K_w$. According to Le Châtelier's principle, an increase in temperature favors the endothermic direction of an equilibrium, which in this case is the dissociation of water into ions. Consequently, at higher temperatures, the equilibrium concentrations of $[\\mathrm{H}_3\\mathrm{O}^+]$ and $[\\mathrm{OH}^-]$ are higher, and the pH of a neutral solution is lower.\n\nThis temperature dependence is fundamentally important in biochemistry. Most biological processes occur in aqueous solution at a physiological temperature near $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. The activities of enzymes, which are the catalysts for nearly all biochemical reactions, are critically dependent on $\\mathrm{pH}$. Their three-dimensional structure and the protonation states of active site residues are sensitive to minute changes in $[\\mathrm{H}_3\\mathrm{O}^+]$. Therefore, physiological neutrality corresponds to a $\\mathrm{pH}$ of approximately $6.81$, not $7.00$. The human body's homeostatic mechanisms, such as the bicarbonate buffer system in blood, maintain the $\\mathrm{pH}$ of blood plasma at approximately $7.4$. This value must be interpreted as being slightly alkaline relative to the true neutral point of $6.81$ at $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, not relative to $7.00$. A failure to account for the temperature-dependence of water's neutral $\\mathrm{pH}$ leads to a fundamental misinterpretation of physiological states such as acidosis and alkalosis, and a flawed understanding of in vivo biomolecular function.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.190}$$", "id": "2615833"}, {"introduction": "Water's remarkable ability to dissolve salts and stabilize charged biomolecules stems from its high dielectric constant.

A direct consequence is that both $\\Delta H^{\\mathrm{solv}}$ and $\\Delta S^{\\mathrm{solv}}$ are strong functions of temperature, as shown by our derivations. To speak of solvation as being \"enthalpy-driven\" or \"entropy-driven\" is therefore a statement valid only at a specific temperature. For example, at low temperatures, $\\Delta S^{\\mathrm{solv}}$ is large and negative, representing an unfavorable ordering of water, while $\\Delta H^{\\mathrm{solv}}$ is often negative (favorable). At higher temperatures, $\\Delta H^{\\mathrm{solv}}$ becomes large and positive, whereas $\\Delta S^{\\mathrm{solv}}$ becomes less unfavorable. This behavior leads to a characteristic temperature of minimum $\\Delta G^{\\mathrm{solv}}$ (maximum solubility), a phenomenon that cannot be understood by examining the thermodynamic parameters at a single temperature.\n\n2.  **Enthalpy-Entropy Compensation and Interpretational Ambiguity:** For many aqueous processes, a strong linear correlation is observed between $\\Delta H$ and $\\Delta S$ when measured across a series of similar compounds or as a function of temperature. This is known as enthalpy-entropy compensation. While it may reflect a true physical phenomenon where energetic changes are intrinsically coupled to changes in solvent order, it is also a potential mathematical artifact. The relationship $\\Delta H^{\\mathrm{solv}} = \\Delta G^{\\mathrm{solv}} + T \\Delta S^{\\mathrm{solv}}$ means that any experimental or statistical error in determining $\\Delta G^{\\mathrm{solv}}$ propagates into the derived quantities $\\Delta H^{\\mathrm{solv}}$ and $\\Delta S^{\\mathrm{solv}}$ in a correlated manner, which can generate a spurious compensation effect. Consequently, interpreting the separate magnitudes of $\\Delta H^{\\mathrm{solv}}$ and $\\Delta S^{\\mathrm{solv}}$ as independent, physically distinct contributions (e.g., solute-water interaction energy versus solvent ordering) is problematic. The free energy, $\\Delta G^{\\mathrm{solv}}$, remains the only robust measure of the overall process spontaneity, while its decomposition into enthalpy and entropy components must be treated with profound caution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{11.94}$$", "id": "2615841"}]}
