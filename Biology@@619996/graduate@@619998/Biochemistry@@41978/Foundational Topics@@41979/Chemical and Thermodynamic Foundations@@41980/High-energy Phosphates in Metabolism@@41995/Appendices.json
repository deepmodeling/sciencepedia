Each adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecule contains two phosphoanhydride bonds, each adenosine diphosphate (ADP) molecule contains one, and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) contains none. Starting from these facts and the definition that an energy charge should range from $0$ (all adenylate as AMP) to $1$ (all adenylate as ATP), derive an expression for the Adenylate Energy Charge in terms of $[\\text{ATP}]$, $[\\text{ADP}]$, and $[\\text{AMP}]$.

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary information for the derivation is provided through fundamental principles and boundary conditions. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe Adenylate Energy Charge (AEC) is a normalized index of the energetic state of the cell. It represents the fraction of the total adenylate pool that is \"charged\" with high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds. Let the concentrations of adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, and adenosine monophosphate be denoted by $[\\text{ATP}]$, $[\\text{ADP}]$, and $[\\text{AMP}]$, respectively. The total adenylate pool concentration, $[\\text{A}]_{\\text{total}}$, is conserved and given by:\n$$\n[\\text{A}]_{\\text{total}} = [\\text{ATP}] + [\\text{ADP}] + [\\text{AMP}]\n$$\nThe problem states that the AEC should range from $0$ to $1$. A value of $0$ corresponds to a state where all adenylate is in the form of AMP, representing zero energy storage in the pool. A value of $1$ corresponds to a state where all adenylate is in the form of ATP, representing maximal energy storage. This suggests that the AEC can be formulated as a weighted average of the adenylate species, normalized by the total adenylate concentration.\n\nLet us propose a general form for the AEC as:\n$$\n\\text{AEC} = \\frac{\\alpha[\\text{ATP}] + \\beta[\\text{ADP}] + \\gamma[\\text{AMP}]}{[\\text{ATP}] + [\\text{ADP}] + [\\text{AMP}]}\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$ are weighting coefficients that represent the relative energy contribution of each species.\n\nWe can determine these coefficients using the conditions provided in the problem statement.\n1.  When the entire pool is AMP ($[\\text{ATP}] = 0$, $[\\text{ADP}] = 0$), the AEC is $0$.\n$$\n\\text{AEC} = \\frac{\\gamma[\\text{AMP}]}{[\\text{AMP}]} = \\gamma = 0\n$$\nThis is consistent with the fact that AMP contains zero high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds.\n\n2.  When the entire pool is ATP ($[\\text{ADP}] = 0$, $[\\text{AMP}] = 0$), the AEC is $1$.\n$$\n\\text{AEC} = \\frac{\\alpha[\\text{ATP}]}{[\\text{ATP}]} = \\alpha = 1\n$$\nThis normalizes the charge scale to the fully charged species, ATP.\n\nWith $\\alpha=1$ and $\\gamma=0$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\text{AEC} = \\frac{[\\text{ATP}] + \\beta[\\text{ADP}]}{[\\text{ATP}] + [\\text{ADP}] + [\\text{AMP}]}\n$$\nTo determine $\\beta$, we must consider the relative energy content of ADP compared to ATP. The problem states that ATP contains two high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds, while ADP contains one. Since the weighting coefficient for ATP, $\\alpha$, is $1$, it is logical to scale the coefficient for ADP based on its relative number of high-energy bonds. ATP is the reference for a fully charged molecule (charge $1$), and it possesses two such bonds. ADP possesses one such bond, which is half the number in ATP. Therefore, its contribution to the energy charge should be half that of ATP.
