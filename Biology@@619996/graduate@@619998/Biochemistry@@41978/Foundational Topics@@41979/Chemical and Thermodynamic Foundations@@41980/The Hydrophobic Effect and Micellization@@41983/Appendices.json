The assumptions are common simplifications for this model. All necessary data are provided and are physically reasonable. Therefore, the problem is **valid** and a solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Relationship:**\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental condition for phase equilibrium: the chemical potential of the surfactant monomer must be equal in the aqueous phase (aq) and the micellar phase (mic) at the CMC.\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{aq}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{mic}} $$\nUsing the provided expression for chemical potential, $\\mu_{\\alpha} = \\mu_{\\alpha}^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_{\\alpha}$, we write the equilibrium condition as:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{aq}}^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{aq}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{mic}}^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{mic}} $$\nThe problem states as assumption (ii) that the micellar phase is the standard state, so the activity of a monomer within the micelle is unity: $a_{\\mathrm{mic}} = 1$. This simplifies the equation, as $\\ln(1) = 0$:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{aq}}^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{aq}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{mic}}^{\\circ} $$\nRearranging this expression gives the difference in standard chemical potentials:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{mic}}^{\\circ} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{aq}}^{\\circ} = RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{aq}} $$\nThis difference is, by definition, the standard Gibbs free energy of transfer of a surfactant monomer from the aqueous solution to the micelle, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{tr}}^{\\circ}$:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{tr}}^{\\circ} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{mic}}^{\\circ} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{aq}}^{\\circ} $$\nCombining the two previous equations yields the relationship between the standard free energy of transfer and the activity of the monomer in the aqueous solution at equilibrium:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{tr}}^{\\circ} = RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{aq}} $$\nAt the CMC, the concentration of free monomer in the aqueous phase is $c = \\mathrm{CMC}$. According to assumption (i), the activity coefficient is $\\gamma = 1$. The activity is defined relative to the standard concentration $C^{\\circ} = 1\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}$, so $a_{\\mathrm{aq}} = \\frac{\\gamma \\cdot \\mathrm{CMC}}{C^{\\circ}} = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\mathrm{CMC}}{1\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}}$. The activity $a_{\\mathrm{aq}}$ becomes numerically equal to the molar concentration, $\\mathrm{CMC}$, when the concentration is expressed in $\\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}$. Thus, we arrive at the required relationship:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{tr}}^{\\circ} = RT \\ln(\\mathrm{CMC}) $$\nwhere $\\mathrm{CMC}$ represents the numerical value of the critical micelle concentration in $\\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}$.\n\n**Calculation of the Free Energy Contribution per Methylene Group:**\nAccording to assumption (iii), the standard free energy of transfer for a surfactant with $n$ methylene groups, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{tr}}^{\\circ}(n)$, is a linear function of $n$:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{tr}}^{\\circ}(n) = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{const}}^{\\circ} + n \\cdot \\Delta g_{\\mathrm{CH_{2}}}^{\\circ} $$\nwhere $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{const}}^{\\circ}$ is the contribution from the head group and any other constant structural features, and $\\Delta g_{\\mathrm{CH_{2}}}^{\\circ}$ is the incremental contribution per methylene group.\n\nWe apply this model to the two given homologs, with $n_{10} = 10$ and $n_{12} = 12$ methylene groups.\nFor the C$_{10}$ homolog:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{tr}}^{\\circ}(10) = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{const}}^{\\circ} + 10 \\cdot \\Delta g_{\\mathrm{CH_{2}}}^{\\circ} = RT \\ln(\\mathrm{CMC}_{10}) $$\nFor the C$_{12}$ homolog:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{tr}}^{\\circ}(12) = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{const}}^{\\circ} + 12 \\cdot \\Delta g_{\\mathrm{CH_{2}}}^{\\circ} = RT \\ln(\\mathrm{CMC}_{12}) $$\nTo find $\\Delta g_{\\mathrm{CH_{2}}}^{\\circ}$, we subtract the first equation from the second, which eliminates the constant term $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{const}}^{\\circ}$:\n$$ (12 \\cdot \\Delta g_{\\mathrm{CH_{2}}}^{\\circ} - 10 \\cdot \\Delta g_{\\mathrm{CH_{2}}}^{\\circ}) = RT \\ln(\\mathrm{CMC}_{12}) - RT \\ln(\\mathrm{CMC}_{10}) $$\n$$ (12 - 10) \\cdot \\Delta g_{\\mathrm{CH_{2}}}^{\\circ} = RT \\left[ \\ln(\\mathrm{CMC}_{12}) - \\ln(\\mathrm{CMC}_{10}) \\right] $$\n$$ 2 \\cdot \\Delta g_{\\mathrm{CH_{2}}}^{\\circ} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{CMC}_{12}}{\\mathrm{CMC}_{10}}\\right) $$\nIsolating $\\Delta g_{\\mathrm{CH_{2}}}^{\\circ}$ gives the expression for its calculation:\n$$ \\Delta g_{\\mathrm{CH_{2}}}^{\\circ} = \\frac{RT}{2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{CMC}_{12}}{\\mathrm{CMC}_{10}}\\right) $$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values:\n$R = 8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$\n$T = 298.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n$\\mathrm{CMC}_{10} = 2.2 \\times 10^{-3}$\n$\\mathrm{CMC}_{12} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4}$\n\n$$ \\Delta g_{\\mathrm{CH_{2}}}^{\\circ} = \\frac{(8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}) \\cdot (298.15\\ \\mathrm{K})}{2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-4}}{2.2 \\times 10^{-3}}\\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta g_{\\mathrm{CH_{2}}}^{\\circ} = \\frac{2478.956... \\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}}{2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{2.0}{22}\\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta g_{\\mathrm{CH_{2}}}^{\\circ} = 1239.478... \\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}} \\cdot \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{11}\\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta g_{\\mathrm{CH_{2}}}^{\\circ} = 1239.478... \\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}} \\cdot (-\\ln(11)) $$\n$$ \\Delta g_{\\mathrm{CH_{2}}}^{\\circ} \\approx 1239.478... \\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}} \\cdot (-2.397895...) $$\n$$ \\Delta g_{\\mathrm{CH_{2}}}^{\\circ} \\approx -2971.99\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}} $$\nTo express the result in $\\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$, we divide by $1000$:\n$$ \\Delta g_{\\mathrm{CH_{2}}}^{\\circ} \\approx -2.97199\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}} $$\nRounding to three significant figures as required gives:\n$$ \\Delta g_{\\mathrm{CH_{2}}}^{\\circ} = -2.97\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}} $$\nThis negative value indicates that the transfer of a methylene group from the aqueous environment to the nonpolar interior of the micelle is a thermodynamically favorable process, which is the essence of the hydrophobic effect driving micellization.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-2.97} $$", "id": "2611771"}, {"introduction": "In real biochemical and pharmaceutical systems, surfactant behavior is often modulated by environmental factors like pH.

Since the surfactant exists in its neutral form, $\\mathrm{HA}$, and its deprotonated form, $\\mathrm{A}^{-}$, the total concentration of monomeric surfactant is given by:\n$$C_{\\text{total}} = [\\mathrm{HA}] + [\\mathrm{A}^{-}]$$\nHere, $[\\mathrm{HA}]$ and $[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]$ represent the molar concentrations of the respective species.\n\nFirst, consider the acid-base equilibrium:\n$$\\mathrm{HA} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{H}^{+} + \\mathrm{A}^{-}$$\nThe acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, is defined by the law of mass action. As activity coefficients are assumed to be unity, we use concentrations:\n$$K_a = \\frac{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}] [\\mathrm{A}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{HA}]}$$\nThe solution is buffered at a fixed $\\mathrm{pH}$, so the hydrogen ion concentration, $[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]$, is constant.

The problem states that only the neutral form, $\\mathrm{HA}$, incorporates into micelles. The onset of micellization occurs at the critical micelle concentration (CMC). This is the concentration at which the chemical potential of the monomer in solution, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{HA,monomer}}$, equals the chemical potential per monomer in the micelle, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{HA,micelle}}$.\n$$\\mu_{\\mathrm{HA,monomer}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{HA,micelle}}$$\nFor an ideal solution, the chemical potential of the monomer is $\\mu_{\\mathrm{HA,monomer}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{HA,monomer}}^{\\circ} + RT \\ln([\\mathrm{HA}])$, where $\\mu_{\\mathrm{HA,monomer}}^{\\circ}$ is the standard chemical potential. The chemical potential of a monomer within a micelle is considered to be constant, equivalent to a standard state $\\mu_{\\mathrm{HA,micelle}}^{\\circ}$, for a large aggregation number (this is the basis of the pseudo-phase separation model of micellization). Thus, at equilibrium:\n$$\\mu_{\\mathrm{HA,monomer}}^{\\circ} + RT \\ln([\\mathrm{HA}]_{\\text{eq}}) = \\mu_{\\mathrm{HA,micelle}}^{\\circ}$$\nThis implies that for micellization to occur, the concentration of the free, neutral monomer, $[\\mathrm{HA}]$, must reach a specific threshold value, $[\\mathrm{HA}]_{\\text{eq}}$, which is determined by the standard free energy of micellization: $[\\mathrm{HA}]_{\\text{eq}} = \\exp\\left( (\\mu_{\\mathrm{HA,micelle}}^{\\circ} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{HA,monomer}}^{\\circ}) / RT \\right)$.\n\nThe problem defines this critical concentration of the neutral species as $c_{\\mathrm{cmc},0}$.

The given activation parameters are $\\Delta H^{\\ddagger} = 110\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$ and $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger} = +20\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$.\n\nThe activation Gibbs free energy at $T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(298\\ \\mathrm{K}) = 110000\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}} - (298\\ \\mathrm{K})(20\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}) = 110000 - 5960 = 104040\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}\n$$\nThe argument of the exponential in the TST equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{R T} = \\frac{104040\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}}{(8.314\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}})(298\\ \\mathrm{K})} \\approx 41.99\n$$\nThe pre-exponential factor is:\n$$\n\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{h} = \\frac{(1.381\\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J\\ K^{-1}})(298\\ \\mathrm{K})}{6.626\\times 10^{-34}\\ \\mathrm{J\\ s}} \\approx 6.20 \\times 10^{12}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}\n$$\nThus, the rate constant is:\n$$\nk(298\\ \\mathrm{K}) \\approx (6.20 \\times 10^{12}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}})\\,\\exp(-41.99) \\approx (6.20 \\times 10^{12}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}})(1.75 \\times 10^{-18}) \\approx 1.085 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}\n$$\nThe characteristic escape time is:\n$$\n\\tau(298\\ \\mathrm{K}) = \\frac{1}{k(298\\ \\mathrm{K})} \\approx \\frac{1}{1.085 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}} \\approx 9.22 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nConverting this to hours: $\\tau \\approx (9.22 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{s}) / (3600\\ \\mathrm{s\\ hr^{-1}}) \\approx 25.6$ hours.\n\nWith these reference values, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. At $T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$, the hours-to-days persistence of $N \\approx 20$ micelles is quantitatively consistent with a kinetic trap caused by a large activation barrier for the fusion–restructuring step, even though the $N \\approx 80$ state is thermodynamically more stable at $C_{\\mathrm{T}} = 5.0\\ \\mathrm{mM} \\gg \\mathrm{CMC}$. A TST estimate yields a characteristic escape time on the order of many hours.**\n\nThe problem states that the equilibrium distribution has a \"deep global minimum at $N \\approx 80$,\" meaning this is the thermodynamically favored aggregate state at $C_{\\mathrm{T}} = 5.0\\ \\mathrm{mM} > \\mathrm{CMC} = 0.20\\ \\mathrm{mM}$. The observation of \"persistent population of small micelles with $N \\approx 20$ that slowly evolve...over many hours\" is the definition of a kinetically trapped metastable state. The existence of such a trap implies a significant activation barrier, which is given as $\\Delta H^{\\ddagger} = 110\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$. My calculation above yields an escape time $\\tau \\approx 25.6$ hours. This value is quantitatively consistent with the description \"hours-to-days persistence\" and is certainly \"on the order of many hours\". Thus, the statement is entirely consistent with the provided data and a standard TST analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Adding $0.50\\ \\mathrm{M}$ sodium chloride at $T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$ both strengthens the thermodynamic drive toward the $N \\approx 80$ state (as indicated by the lower CMC) and accelerates escape from the kinetic trap by lowering $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ by approximately $10\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$, leading to a predicted relaxation time on the order of $10^{3}$–$10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{s}$.**\n\nThis statement makes three claims.\n1.  *Thermodynamic drive*: Adding $0.50\\ \\mathrm{M}$ NaCl to the initial $I=0.10 \\text{ M}$ solution yields a final ionic strength $I = 0.60\\ \\mathrm{M}$. The data show that at this new ionic strength, the CMC drops from $0.20\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ to $0.05\\ \\mathrm{mM}$. A lower CMC signifies that micellization is more favorable, as salt screens head-group repulsion. This strengthens the thermodynamic drive to form aggregates. This part is correct.\n2.  *Activation energy*: The problem states this salt addition reduces $\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}$ by $10\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$ with no change in $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$. The new activation enthalpy is $\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{new}} = 110 - 10 = 100\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$. The change in activation Gibbs free energy is $\\Delta(\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}) = \\Delta(\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}) - T\\Delta(\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}) = -10\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}} - T(0) = -10\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$. This part is correct.\n3.  *Relaxation time*: We must calculate the new escape time, $\\tau_{\\text{new}}$. The new activation free energy is $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{new}} = \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{old}} - 10000\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}} = 104040 - 10000 = 94040\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}$.\n    The new rate constant is:\n    $$\n    k_{\\text{new}}(298\\ \\mathrm{K}) = k_{\\text{old}} \\times \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta(\\Delta G^{\\ddagger})}{RT}\\right) = (1.085 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\times \\exp\\left(\\frac{10000\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}}{8.314\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}} \\times 298\\ \\mathrm{K}}\\right)\n    $$\n    $$\n    k_{\\text{new}}(298\\ \\mathrm{K}) \\approx (1.085 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\times \\exp(4.036) \\approx (1.085 \\times 10^{-5})(56.6) \\approx 6.14 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}\n    $$\n    The new relaxation time is $\\tau_{\\text{new}} = 1/k_{\\text{new}} \\approx 1/(6.14 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\approx 1629\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n    This value, $1629\\ \\mathrm{s}$, is within the specified range of $10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{s}$ to $10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{s}$ (i.e., $1000\\ \\mathrm{s}$ to $10000\\ \\mathrm{s}$).\nAll three claims in the statement are quantitatively supported.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Rapidly diluting the sample at $T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$ from $C_{\\mathrm{T}} = 5.0\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ to $C_{\\mathrm{T}} = 0.05\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ should promote coalescence of $N \\approx 20$ micelles into $N \\approx 80$ micelles because the reduced number density of micelles decreases the frequency of fission events.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. At $T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$ and $I = 0.10\\ \\mathrm{M}$, the critical micelle concentration (CMC) is $0.20\\ \\mathrm{mM}$. The proposed dilution to a final concentration of $C_{\\mathrm{T}} = 0.05\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ brings the system to a state *below* the CMC. In such a regime, micelles are thermodynamically unstable. The equilibrium state is a solution of surfactant monomers. Therefore, dilution will promote the *dissolution* (dissociation) of all micelles, not their coalescence into larger aggregates. Furthermore, the reasoning provided is incorrect. Coalescence is a bimolecular process involving the collision of two micelles. Its rate is proportional to the square of the micelle concentration. Dilution, which reduces the micelle concentration, would drastically *decrease* the rate of coalescence. Fission or monomer dissociation is a unimolecular process whose per-micelle rate is largely independent of the concentration of other micelles. The statement is incorrect in both its premise and its reasoning.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Because the $N \\approx 80$ state is the global Gibbs free energy minimum at $T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$, an isothermal, closed sample must reach that state on laboratory timescales regardless of kinetic barriers.**\n\nThis statement demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of chemical kinetics. Thermodynamics dictates the direction of spontaneous change and the final equilibrium state, but it provides no information about the rate of that change. The rate is governed by kinetics, specifically the height of the activation energy barrier ($\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$) separating the initial and final states. The phrase \"regardless of kinetic barriers\" is a direct contradiction of the principles of kinetics. A large kinetic barrier can make a thermodynamically favored process so slow that it is not observed on any practical timescale, including \"laboratory timescales\". The problem itself, with its description of \"persistence...over many hours\", is a testament to the fact that kinetic barriers are critically important. The conversion of diamond to graphite is a classic textbook example of a thermodynamically favorable process that is kinetically forbidden under standard conditions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. A brief temperature jump to $T = 323\\ \\mathrm{K}$ followed by a return to $T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$ constitutes an annealing protocol that can accelerate attainment of the $N \\approx 80$ state; TST with the given activation parameters predicts a much faster escape at $T = 323\\ \\mathrm{K}$, while the equilibrium preference at $T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$ is unchanged by the temporary excursion.**\n\nThis statement accurately describes an annealing protocol. Let us verify the quantitative claim about acceleration. We need to calculate the rate constant at $T = 323\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n$$\n\\frac{k(323\\ \\mathrm{K})}{k(298\\ \\mathrm{K})} = \\frac{T_{323}}{T_{298}} \\exp\\left[ \\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(298)}{RT_{298}} - \\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(323)}{RT_{323}} \\right]\n$$\nA simpler approach utilizes the Arrhenius-like dependence on $\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}$ embedded in the TST equation:\n$$\n\\frac{k(323\\ \\mathrm{K})}{k(298\\ \\mathrm{K})} = \\frac{323}{298} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}}{R} \\left[ \\frac{1}{323\\ \\mathrm{K}} - \\frac{1}{298\\ \\mathrm{K}} \\right] \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{k(323\\ \\mathrm{K})}{k(298\\ \\mathrm{K})} = 1.084 \\times \\exp\\left( -\\frac{110000}{8.314} [-0.0002598] \\right) = 1.084 \\times \\exp(3.436) \\approx 1.084 \\times 31.06 \\approx 33.7\n$$\nThe rate of escape from the kinetic trap is accelerated by a factor of approximately $34$ at the higher temperature. A process that takes $25.6$ hours at $298\\ \\mathrm{K}$ would take only about $25.6/33.7 \\approx 0.76$ hours (about $45$ minutes) at $323\\ \\mathrm{K}$. This is a substantial acceleration, allowing the system to rapidly convert from $N \\approx 20$ to $N \\approx 80$ micelles. Upon cooling back to $T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$, the system remains in the $N \\approx 80$ state, which is the stable equilibrium at this final temperature. The equilibrium state itself is a function of the state variables ($T$, $p$, etc.) and is not altered by the path taken to reach it. The statement is fully consistent with thermodynamic and kinetic principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABE}$$", "id": "2611803"}]}
