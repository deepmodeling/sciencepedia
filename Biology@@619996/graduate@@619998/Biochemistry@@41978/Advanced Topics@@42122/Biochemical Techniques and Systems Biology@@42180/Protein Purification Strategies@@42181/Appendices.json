It is scientifically grounded in the principles of spectrophotometry (the Beer-Lambert law), provides a self-contained and consistent set of data, and is formulated objectively. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between absorbance, concentration, and pathlength is described by the Beer-Lambert law:\n$$A = \\epsilon c l$$\nwhere $A$ is the measured absorbance (dimensionless), $\\epsilon$ is the molar absorptivity coefficient (with units of $\\text{M}^{-1}\\text{cm}^{-1}$), $c$ is the molar concentration of the absorbing species (in $\\text{M}$, or $\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$), and $l$ is the pathlength of the light through the sample (in $\\text{cm}$).\n\nThe problem requires a statement of assumptions for the linearity of this measurement. The validity of the Beer-Lambert law is contingent upon the following conditions:\n1. The solution must be homogeneous and non-scattering. The problem specifies a \"clarified fraction,\" which is assumed to meet this criterion.\n2. The concentration of the analyte must be sufficiently low such that molecules do not interact with each other, as such interactions can alter the molar absorptivity. The given absorbance of $A=0.90$ is well within the typical linear range for modern spectrophotometers.\n3. No other substances in the sample significantly absorb light at the measurement wavelength of $280 \\, \\text{nm}$. In protein purification, potential contaminants include nucleic acids, which also absorb at this wavelength. We assume such contamination is negligible.\n4. The incident radiation is monochromatic, or has a spectral bandwidth that is narrow relative to the absorption band of the analyte.\n5. The absorbing species is stable and does not undergo chemical reaction, association, or dissociation during the measurement.\n\nFirst, we rearrange the Beer-Lambert law to solve for the molar concentration, $c$:\n$$c = \\frac{A}{\\epsilon l}$$\nThe given values are:\nAbsorbance, $A = 0.90$\nMolar absorptivity, $\\epsilon = 45{,}000 \\, \\text{M}^{-1} \\text{cm}^{-1}$\nPathlength, $l = 1 \\, \\text{cm}$\n\nSubstituting these values, we find the molar concentration:\n$$c = \\frac{0.90}{45{,}000 \\, \\text{M}^{-1} \\text{cm}^{-1} \\times 1 \\, \\text{cm}} = 0.00002 \\, \\text{M}$$\nThis is equivalent to $c = 2.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we must convert this molar concentration to a mass concentration, $\\rho$, in units of $\\text{mg/mL}$. This conversion requires the molecular weight, $M_w$, of the protein. The relationship is:\n$$\\rho = c \\times M_w$$\nThe given molecular weight is $M_w = 50 \\, \\text{kDa}$. We convert this to units of $\\text{g} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{-1}$:\n$$M_w = 50 \\, \\text{kDa} = 50 \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{Da} = 50{,}000 \\, \\text{g} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{-1}$$\nNow, we calculate the mass concentration in units of $\\text{g} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$:\n$$\\rho = (2.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}) \\times (50{,}000 \\, \\text{g} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{-1}) = 1.0 \\, \\text{g} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$$\nThe final step is to convert the units from $\\text{g} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$ to $\\text{mg} \\cdot \\text{mL}^{-1}$. The conversion is a factor of $1$:\n$$1 \\, \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{L}} = \\frac{1 \\, \\text{g}}{1 \\, \\text{L}} \\times \\left(\\frac{1000 \\, \\text{mg}}{1 \\, \\text{g}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1 \\, \\text{L}}{1000 \\, \\text{mL}}\\right) = 1 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}}$$\nTherefore, the concentration of the protein is $1.0 \\, \\text{mg/mL}$.\n\nThe problem explicitly instructs to round the final answer to three significant figures. While some of the input data ($A=0.90$, $M_w=50$) are stated with only two significant figures, such a directive in a problem statement supersedes the standard rules for propagating significant figures. It implies the input values should be treated as having sufficient precision for the requested output precision. The calculated value is exactly $1$.

The presence of extraneous information, such as the resin density, does not invalidate the problem but tests the student's understanding of the relevant physical quantities.\n\nThe derivation begins with the principle of conservation of mass for the protein species, applied to the chromatography column as a control volume. The integral mass balance from the start of the feed injection, which we define as time $t=0$, until the time of $10\\%$ breakthrough, $t_{10\\%}$, is expressed as:\n$$ M_{in} = M_{out} + M_{acc} $$\nHere, $M_{in}$ is the total mass of protein that has entered the column, $M_{out}$ is the total mass of protein that has exited the column in the effluent, and $M_{acc}$ is the total mass of protein that has accumulated within the column boundaries.\n\nThe terms in the mass balance are defined as follows:\nThe mass input is the product of the constant feed concentration $C_0$ and the total volume of feed processed up to the $10\\%$ breakthrough point, $V_{\\text{feed}, 10\\%}$:\n$$ M_{in} = C_0 V_{\\text{feed}, 10\\%} $$\nThe mass output is the integral of the effluent mass flow rate over time, or equivalently, the integral of the effluent concentration $C(V)$ with respect to the processed volume $V$:\n$$ M_{out} = \\int_{0}^{V_{\\text{feed}, 10\\%}} C(V) \\, dV $$\nThe accumulated mass, $M_{acc}$, is partitioned between two phases within the column: the mass adsorbed onto the stationary phase, which we denote as $Q_{ads, 10\\%}$, and the mass dissolved in the mobile liquid phase occupying the interstitial column voids, denoted as $Q_{mobile}$.\n$$ M_{acc} = Q_{ads, 10\\%} + Q_{mobile} $$\nCombining these terms gives the complete mass balance equation:\n$$ C_0 V_{\\text{feed}, 10\\%} = \\int_{0}^{V_{\\text{feed}, 10\\%}} C(V) \\, dV + Q_{ads, 10\\%} + Q_{mobile} $$\nTo solve for $Q_{ads, 10\\%}$ using the single data point provided, it is necessary to introduce standard idealizations that simplify the system. These must be clearly stated.\n1.  **Negligible Eluted Mass**: The amount of protein that has exited the column by the time the effluent reaches $10\\%$ of the feed concentration is small for a well-packed column with good mass transfer characteristics. Therefore, we make the simplifying approximation that this eluted mass is negligible compared to the total mass loaded. Mathematically, $\\int_{0}^{V_{\\text{feed}, 10\\%}} C(V) \\, dV \\approx 0$.\n2.  **Saturated Mobile Phase**: We assume that the mobile phase occupying the interstitial void volume of the column is fully saturated with protein at the feed concentration $C_0$. This is a common assumption in plug-flow models of chromatography. The mass of protein in the mobile phase is thus $Q_{mobile} = C_0 V_{void}$, where $V_{void}$ is the interstitial void volume.\n\nBy applying these two idealizations, the mass balance equation is reduced to a simple algebraic form:\n$$ C_0 V_{\\text{feed}, 10\\%} \\approx 0 + Q_{ads, 10\\%} + C_0 V_{void} $$\nThe problem asks for an expression for the amount of protein adsorbed, $Q_{ads, 10\\%}$.

The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, so we will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem states that chromatographic resolution is defined conceptually as \"the separation between the centers of two peaks normalized by a characteristic width that quantifies their average spreading.\" We must translate this qualitative definition into a quantitative mathematical expression using the provided measurable quantities.\n\nLet the two protein isoforms be denoted by subscripts $1$ and $2$.\nThe elution profile of each is a Gaussian peak. The center of a Gaussian peak corresponds to its mean, which is given as the retention time, $t_R$. Thus, the centers of the two peaks are located at times $t_{R1}$ and $t_{R2}$ on the chromatogram. The separation between the peak centers is the absolute difference between these retention times, which we denote as $\\Delta t_R$:\n$$\n\\Delta t_R = |t_{R2} - t_{R1}|\n$$\n\nNext, we must formalize the denominator term: \"a characteristic width that quantifies their average spreading.\" The spreading of each peak is given by its baseline width, $w_1$ and $w_2$.

It is critical to understand that the denominator in the standard definition of resolution is not the average width itself, but rather the sum of the widths forms the basis for normalization. The standard definition, consistent with the conceptual statement, is:\n$$\nR_s = \\frac{\\text{separation between centers}}{\\text{average of baseline widths}} = \\frac{|t_{R2} - t_{R1}|}{\\frac{1}{2}(w_1 + w_2)}\n$$\nThis is the widely accepted formula for resolution in chromatography.
