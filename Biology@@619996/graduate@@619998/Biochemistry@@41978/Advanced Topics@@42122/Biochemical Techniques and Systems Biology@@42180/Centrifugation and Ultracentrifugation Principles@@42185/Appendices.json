All necessary parameters are provided, and the objectives are clear. We shall proceed with a rigorous solution based on fundamental principles of sedimentation.\n\nThe sedimentation of a particle in a centrifugal field is governed by the radial velocity, $v_r$, which is the rate of change of its radial position, $r$, with respect to time, $t$. This velocity is defined by the Lamm equation, which under conditions of negligible diffusion and constant angular velocity simplifies to:\n$$\nv_r = \\frac{dr}{dt} = s \\omega^2 r\n$$\nHere, $\\omega$ is the constant angular velocity of the rotor in radians per second, and $s$ is the sedimentation coefficient of the particle, a measure of its sedimentation velocity per unit of applied acceleration. The sedimentation coefficient has units of seconds.

It states that $k$ is the time in hours required to pellet a particle with a sedimentation coefficient of $1 \\ S$ at maximum speed. Let $t_h$ be the pelleting time in hours and $s_S$ be the sedimentation coefficient in Svedberg units. The inverse proportionality can be written as $t_h \\cdot s_S = C$, where $C$ is a constant. Using the definition of $k$: when $s_S = 1$, the time is $t_h = k$. Substituting these values gives $k \\cdot 1 = C$, so the constant is $C=k$.\n\nTherefore, the functional dependence of the pelleting time in hours, $t_h$, on the sedimentation coefficient in Svedbergs, $s_S$, and the rotor $k$-factor is:\n$$\nt_h = \\frac{k}{s_S}\n$$\nThis is the first required part of the solution.\n\nNext, we must compute the minimum run time required to pellet all species with a sedimentation coefficient $s \\geq s_{cut}$. Since pelleting time is inversely proportional to the sedimentation coefficient, the species with the smallest $s$ value in the specified range will require the longest time to pellet. To ensure all species with $s \\geq s_{cut}$ are pelleted, the centrifugation must proceed for a duration sufficient to pellet the species with $s = s_{cut}$.\nThe minimum run time, $t_{run}$, is therefore:\n$$\nt_{run} = \\frac{k}{s_{cut}}\n$$\nGiven the values $k = 53.7$ and $s_{cut} = 9.60 \\ S$:\n$$\nt_{run} = \\frac{53.7}{9.60} \\ \\mathrm{hours} = 5.59375 \\ \\mathrm{hours}\n$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nt_{run} \\approx 5.594 \\ \\mathrm{hours}\n$$\n\nFinally, we must determine if the smaller species with $s_{small} = 8.00 \\ S$ will remain in the supernatant.

It presents a standard task in the physical chemistry of macromolecules, requiring a derivation from first principles followed by a numerical calculation using realistic data. I shall now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the scaling of the sedimentation coefficient, $s$, and its subsequent use to standardize an experimental value to reference conditions.\n\nFirst, the derivation. We consider a single macromolecule of mass $m$ sedimenting in a solvent within a centrifuge rotor spinning at a constant angular velocity $\\omega$. The particle is at a radial position $r$ from the axis of rotation. In the co-rotating reference frame, the particle is subject to three forces along the radial direction: the centrifugal force ($F_c$), the buoyant force ($F_b$), and the frictional drag force ($F_d$).\n\n According to Newton's second law, the net force equals mass times acceleration, $ma_r = \\sum F_r$. Sedimentation velocity, $v = dr/dt$, becomes constant very rapidly when the net force on the particle becomes zero. This is the steady-state condition requested.\n$$F_{net} = F_c - F_b - F_d = 0$$\n\nThe individual forces are defined as follows:\n$1$. The centrifugal force, $F_c$, is the apparent outward force experienced by the particle due to the rotation:\n$$F_c = m a_c = m \\omega^2 r$$\nwhere $a_c = \\omega^2 r$ is the centrifugal acceleration.\n\n$2$. The buoyant force, $F_b$, is, by Archimedes' principle, equal to the centrifugal force acting on the mass of the solvent displaced by the particle. The volume of the solvated particle is $V_p$. If the solvent has a mass density $\\rho$, the mass of the displaced solvent is $m_s = V_p \\rho$. Thus, the buoyant force is:\n$$F_b = m_s \\omega^2 r = (V_p \\rho) \\omega^2 r$$\n\n$3$. The frictional drag force, $F_d$, opposes the motion of the particle through the solvent. For the low Reynolds number regime typical of macromolecules, this force is linearly proportional to the sedimentation velocity $v$:\n$$F_d = fv$$\nwhere $f$ is the frictional coefficient, which depends on the particle's size and shape, as well as the solvent's viscosity.\n\nSubstituting these forces into the steady-state force balance equation gives:\n$$m \\omega^2 r - (V_p \\rho) \\omega^2 r - fv = 0$$\n\nTo proceed, we must relate the particle's volume $V_p$ to its mass $m$.\nThis is accomplished using the partial specific volume of the protein, $\\bar{v}$. The partial specific volume is the change in total solution volume per unit mass of solute added at constant temperature and pressure. It is a very good approximation to consider the volume occupied by the macromolecule itself to be $V_p = m \\bar{v}$. This is a principal assumption.\n\nSubstituting $V_p = m \\bar{v}$ into the force balance equation:\n$$m \\omega^2 r - (m \\bar{v} \\rho) \\omega^2 r - fv = 0$$\nWe can factor out common terms:\n$$m(1 - \\bar{v}\\rho)\\omega^2 r = fv$$\nThe term $(1 - \\bar{v}\\rho)$ is known as the buoyancy factor.\n\nThe problem requires using the definition of the sedimentation coefficient, $s$. The sedimentation coefficient is defined as the sedimentation velocity, $v$, per unit centrifugal acceleration, $\\omega^2 r$:\n$$s = \\frac{v}{\\omega^2 r}$$\nFrom our force balance equation, we can express the velocity as $v = \\frac{m(1 - \\bar{v}\\rho)\\omega^2 r}{f}$. Substituting this into the definition of $s$ yields:\n$$s = \\frac{1}{\\omega^2 r} \\left( \\frac{m(1 - \\bar{v}\\rho)\\omega^2 r}{f} \\right) = \\frac{m(1 - \\bar{v}\\rho)}{f}$$\nThis is the Svedberg equation.\n\nNow we must determine how $s$ scales with solvent viscosity $\\eta$ and density $\\rho$. The frictional coefficient $f$ encapsulates the dependence on solvent viscosity and particle geometry. For any particle shape, $f$ is directly proportional to the dynamic viscosity of the solvent, $\\eta$. We can write this relationship as $f = k_f \\eta$, where $k_f$ is a shape-dependent frictional prefactor that is constant for a rigid particle of a given size and conformation.\n\nSubstituting this into the Svedberg equation, we obtain:\n$$s = \\frac{m(1 - \\bar{v}\\rho)}{k_f \\eta}$$\nThe problem assumes that the macromolecule's molar mass (and thus its mass $m$), conformation, and shape (and thus $k_f$) are constant. The partial specific volume $\\bar{v}$ is also given as constant. Therefore, the quantities $m$ and $k_f$ are intrinsic properties of the protein under the specified assumptions.\nThe scaling of $s$ with solvent properties is then:\n$$s \\propto \\frac{1 - \\bar{v}\\rho}{\\eta}$$\n\nTemperature affects $s$ primarily through its influence on the solvent properties $\\eta$ and $\\rho$. For water and typical aqueous buffers:\n- As temperature increases, solvent viscosity $\\eta$ decreases significantly. Since $\\eta$ is in the denominator, a decrease in $\\eta$ causes $s$ to increase.\n- As temperature increases, solvent density $\\rho$ also decreases, though typically to a lesser extent than viscosity. Since $\\rho$ appears in the numerator term $(1 - \\bar{v}\\rho)$, a decrease in $\\rho$ leads to an increase in this buoyancy factor (as $\\bar{v}$ is positive), which in turn causes $s$ to increase.\nBoth effects act in the same direction, leading to a larger sedimentation coefficient at higher temperatures.\n\nNow, we use this derived scaling to standardize the measured sedimentation coefficient, $s$, to reference conditions, denoted by the subscript $_{20,w}$ (water at $20\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$). Let the experimental conditions be denoted by no subscript and reference conditions by $_{20,w}$.\nFrom our derived equation, we can write:\n$$s = \\frac{m}{k_f} \\frac{(1 - \\bar{v}\\rho)}{\\eta} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad s_{20,w} = \\frac{m}{k_f} \\frac{(1 - \\bar{v}\\rho_{20,w})}{\\eta_{20,w}}$$\nThe term $\\frac{m}{k_f}$ is constant between the two conditions. Thus, we can establish a ratio:\n$$\\frac{s \\eta}{1 - \\bar{v}\\rho} = \\frac{s_{20,w} \\eta_{20,w}}{1 - \\bar{v}\\rho_{20,w}}$$\nRearranging this expression to solve for the standardized sedimentation coefficient, $s_{20,w}$, gives the correction formula:\n$$s_{20,w} = s \\left( \\frac{\\eta}{\\eta_{20,w}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1 - \\bar{v}\\rho_{20,w}}{1 - \\bar{v}\\rho} \\right)$$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $s = 5.90$ Svedberg units\n- $\\eta = 1.40 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}$\n- $\\rho = 1.020 \\text{ g}\\cdot\\text{mL}^{-1}$\n- $\\eta_{20,w} = 1.002 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}$\n- $\\rho_{20,w} = 0.9982 \\text{ g}\\cdot\\text{mL}^{-1}$\n- $\\bar{v} = 0.730 \\text{ mL}\\cdot\\text{g}^{-1}$\n\nNow we substitute these values into the correction formula.
