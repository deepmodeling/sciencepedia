It is a standard, fundamental derivation in analytical biochemistry. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation proceeds by systematically applying the three premises provided in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, according to premise (i), the monoisotopic neutral mass of the peptide, which we shall denote as $M_{\\text{neutral}}$, is the sum of the exact masses of all its constituent atoms. Given the elemental composition $C_{x}H_{y}N_{n}O_{w}S_{v}$, this mass is calculated as:\n$$M_{\\text{neutral}} = x \\cdot m_{C} + y \\cdot m_{H} + n \\cdot m_{N} + w \\cdot m_{O} + v \\cdot m_{S}$$\n\nSecond, according to premise (ii), mass is conserved during the ionization process. The ion is formed by the addition of $Z$ protons to the neutral peptide molecule. The total mass of the resulting ion, denoted as $M_{\\text{ion}}$, is therefore the sum of the neutral mass and the total mass of the added protons.\n$$M_{\\text{ion}} = M_{\\text{neutral}} + Z \\cdot m_{p}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $M_{\\text{neutral}}$ from the first step gives the complete expression for the ion's mass:\n$$M_{\\text{ion}} = (x \\cdot m_{C} + y \\cdot m_{H} + n \\cdot m_{N} + w \\cdot m_{O} + v \\cdot m_{S}) + Z \\cdot m_{p}$$\n\nThird, according to premise (iii), the mass-to-charge ratio, denoted as $m/z$, is defined as the total mass of the ion divided by its charge state $Z$, where $Z$ is an integer representing the number of elementary charge units.\n$$\\frac{m}{z} = \\frac{M_{\\text{ion}}}{Z}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the full expression for $M_{\\text{ion}}$ into the definition of $m/z$ to obtain the desired closed-form analytic expression:\n$$\\frac{m}{z} = \\frac{(x m_{C} + y m_{H} + n m_{N} + w m_{O} + v m_{S}) + Z m_{p}}{Z}$$\nThis expression can be simplified by distributing the denominator $Z$ to both terms in the numerator:\n$$\\frac{m}{z} = \\frac{x m_{C} + y m_{H} + n m_{N} + w m_{O} + v m_{S}}{Z} + \\frac{Z m_{p}}{Z}$$\nThe second term simplifies, yielding the final, fully simplified expression for the mass-to-charge ratio:\n$$\\frac{m}{z} = \\frac{x m_{C} + y m_{H} + n m_{N} + w m_{O} + v m_{S}}{Z} + m_{p}$$\nThe problem mentions that if masses are in Daltons (Da) and charge is in elementary charge units, the resulting $m/z$ is in units of Thomson (Th).

The first requires the calculation of mass error in parts per million (ppm). The second requires a quantitative analysis of whether a specific amino acid substitution can be distinguished based on precursor ion mass. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and provides all necessary data for a rigorous solution. We shall address each part in sequence.\n\nFirst, we compute the mass error. The mass error in ppm is defined as the fractional deviation of the measured mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z_{\\text{meas}}$) from the theoretical mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z_{\\text{theo}}$), scaled by $10^6$.

The fundamental principle is that two species are distinguishable by mass if the difference in their $m/z$ values is greater than the mass tolerance window used for identification.\n\nThe relevant given masses are:\n-   Monoisotopic residue mass of Lysine: $m_{\\text{Lys}} = 128.094963\\ \\text{Da}$\n-   Monoisotopic residue mass of Glutamine: $m_{\\text{Gln}} = 128.058578\\ \\text{Da}$\n-   Monoisotopic mass of a proton: $m_{\\text{H}} = 1.007276\\ \\text{Da}$\n-   Neutral monoisotopic mass of the original peptide: $M = 1500.0000\\ \\text{Da}$\n\nThe mass difference ($\\Delta M_{\\text{subst}}$) at the neutral peptide level resulting from a Lys-for-Gln substitution is the difference between their residue masses:\n$$\n\\Delta M_{\\text{subst}} = m_{\\text{Lys}} - m_{\\text{Gln}} = 128.094963\\ \\text{Da} - 128.058578\\ \\text{Da} = 0.036385\\ \\text{Da}\n$$\nThis mass difference is observed in the mass spectrometer as a shift in the mass-to-charge ratio, $\\Delta(m/z)$. For an ion of charge state $z$, this shift is:\n$$\n\\Delta(m/z) = \\frac{\\Delta M_{\\text{subst}}}{z}\n$$\nWe must evaluate this for charge states $z=2$ and $z=3$.\nFor $z=2$: $\\Delta(m/z)_{z=2} = \\frac{0.036385}{2} = 0.0181925$.\nFor $z=3$: $\\Delta(m/z)_{z=3} = \\frac{0.036385}{3} \\approx 0.0121283$.\n\nNow, we must determine the mass tolerance window in absolute $m/z$ units for the specified ppm tolerances. The absolute tolerance, $\\Delta_{tol}$, for a given $m/z$ value and a ppm tolerance $\\delta$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta_{tol} = (m/z) \\times \\delta \\times 10^{-6}\n$$\nTo calculate this, we first need the theoretical $m/z$ of the precursor ion for each charge state. The $m/z$ of a protonated peptide is given by $(M + z \\cdot m_{\\text{H}})/z$.\nFor $z=2$:\n$$\nm/z_{z=2} = \\frac{1500.0000 + 2 \\times 1.007276}{2} = \\frac{1502.014552}{2} = 751.007276\n$$\nFor $z=3$:\n$$\nm/z_{z=3} = \\frac{1500.0000 + 3 \\times 1.007276}{3} = \\frac{1503.021828}{3} = 501.007276\n$$\nThe two peptides are distinguishable if the $m/z$ difference, $\\Delta(m/z)$, is greater than the allowed tolerance $\\Delta_{tol}$. We analyze the four given scenarios.\n\nCase 1: Charge state $z=2$ ($m/z_{z=2} = 751.007276$)\n-   Tolerance of $\\pm 5\\ \\text{ppm}$:\n    $\\Delta_{tol, 5\\text{ppm}} = 751.007276 \\times 5 \\times 10^{-6} = 0.003755$.\n    The mass shift is $\\Delta(m/z)_{z=2} = 0.0181925$. Since $0.0181925 > 0.003755$, the substitution is distinguishable.\n-   Tolerance of $\\pm 10\\ \\text{ppm}$:\n    $\\Delta_{tol, 10\\text{ppm}} = 751.007276 \\times 10 \\times 10^{-6} = 0.007510$.\n    The mass shift is $\\Delta(m/z)_{z=2} = 0.0181925$. Since $0.0181925 > 0.007510$, the substitution is distinguishable.\n\nCase 2: Charge state $z=3$ ($m/z_{z=3} = 501.007276$)\n-   Tolerance of $\\pm 5\\ \\text{ppm}$:\n    $\\Delta_{tol, 5\\text{ppm}} = 501.007276 \\times 5 \\times 10^{-6} = 0.002505$.\n    The mass shift is $\\Delta(m/z)_{z=3} \\approx 0.0121283$.

Since $0.0121283 > 0.005010$, the substitution is distinguishable.\n\nIn conclusion, for both doubly and triply charged ions of this peptide, the $m/z$ difference resulting from a lysine-to-glutamine substitution is significantly larger than the absolute mass window defined by either a $\\pm 5\\ \\text{ppm}$ or a $\\pm 10\\ \\text{ppm}$ tolerance.

It is therefore deemed valid. The solution proceeds in two parts: first, the numerical calculation of the mass-to-charge difference $\\Delta$, and second, a mechanistic explanation of the differential fragmentation behavior.\n\nPart 1: Calculation of $\\Delta = \\left(m/z\\right)_{\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{Na}\\right]^{+}} - \\left(m/z\\right)_{\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{NH}_{4}\\right]^{+}}$\n\nThe mass-to-charge ratio, $m/z$, for a singly charged ion ($z = +1$) is numerically equal to its mass in atomic mass units ($\\mathrm{u}$). The mass of an adduct ion $\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{C}\\right]^{+}$ is the sum of the mass of the neutral molecule, $M$, and the mass of the adduct cation, $C^{+}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the monoisotopic mass of the neutral triacylglycerol molecule, $M$, with the elemental composition $\\mathrm{C}_{55}\\mathrm{H}_{102}\\mathrm{O}_{6}$.\nThe formula for $M$ is:\n$$ M = 55 \\times m\\!\\left(^{12}\\mathrm{C}\\right) + 102 \\times m\\!\\left(^{1}\\mathrm{H}\\right) + 6 \\times m\\!\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the provided monoisotopic masses:\n$m\\!\\left(^{12}\\mathrm{C}\\right) = 12.000000000\\,\\mathrm{u}$\n$m\\!\\left(^{1}\\mathrm{H}\\right) = 1.00782503223\\,\\mathrm{u}$\n$m\\!\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right) = 15.99491461957\\,\\mathrm{u}$\nSo, the mass $M$ is:\n$$ M = (55 \\times 12.000000000) + (102 \\times 1.00782503223) + (6 \\times 15.99491461957)\\,\\mathrm{u} $$\n$$ M = 660.000000000 + 102.79815328746 + 95.96948771742\\,\\mathrm{u} $$\n$$ M = 858.76764100488\\,\\mathrm{u} $$\nNext, we define the mass-to-charge ratio difference, $\\Delta$.

It forms adducts by coordinating non-covalently with the most electronegative sites in the TAG molecule, which are the carbonyl oxygens of the three ester groups. This interaction is primarily electrostatic. The resulting sodiated precursor ion, $\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{Na}\\right]^{+}$, is relatively stable. The positive charge is localized on the sodium ion and is not readily transferred to the TAG backbone. Consequently, upon collisional activation, significant energy is required to break covalent bonds within the TAG structure, as the dissociation of the $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ adduct itself is energetically demanding. The dominant fragmentation pathway for $\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{Na}\\right]^{+}$ ions involves the neutral loss of a fatty acid ($R_iCOOH$), which leads to the formation of a sodiated diacylglycerol-like fragment ion, $\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{Na}-R_iCOOH\\right]^{+}$ or $\\left[\\mathrm{DAG}+\\mathrm{Na}\\right]^{+}$. These fragment ions provide information about the fatty acid composition of the parent lipid.\n\nIn contrast, the ammonium cation, $\\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$, is a Brønsted-Lowry acid, functioning as a proton donor. It forms adducts with the TAG molecule primarily through hydrogen bonding, again with the ester carbonyl oxygens. However, the $\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{NH}_{4}\\right]^{+}$ adduct is much more labile than the sodiated counterpart. Upon even low-energy collisional activation, the most favorable and dominant fragmentation pathway is the facile loss of a neutral ammonia molecule ($\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$), which is coupled with the transfer of a proton to the TAG molecule. This process generates a protonated molecule, $\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{H}\\right]^{+}$.\n$$ \\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{NH}_{4}\\right]^{+} \\xrightarrow{\\text{CID}} \\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{H}\\right]^{+} + \\mathrm{NH}_{3} $$\nThe subsequent fragmentation observed in the tandem mass spectrum is that of the $\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{H}\\right]^{+}$ ion. In this ion, the proton is \"mobile\" and can reside on any of the carbonyl oxygens. Fragmentation of $\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{H}\\right]^{+}$ readily proceeds via the neutral loss of a fatty acid ($R_iCOOH$), which results in the formation of a characteristic diacylglycerol-like carbocation, $\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{H}-R_iCOOH\\right]^{+}$ or $\\left[\\mathrm{DAG}\\right]^{+}$. The mobility of the proton in the $\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{H}\\right]^{+}$ intermediate can facilitate more diverse and structurally informative fragmentation pathways compared to the charge-remote fragmentation typical of stable $\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{Na}\\right]^{+}$ adducts, often providing better evidence for positional isomers (sn-position) of fatty acids.\n\nIn summary, choosing $\\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$ as the adducting agent effectively transforms the precursor ion into a protonated species in the gas phase, making the fragmentation behavior characteristic of a Brønsted-Lowry acid-base reaction. This leads to efficient generation of diagnostic $\\left[\\mathrm{DAG}\\right]^{+}$ fragments. Choosing $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ creates a stable, charge-localized adduct that requires higher energy to fragment and yields sodiated fragments, i.e., $\\left[\\mathrm{DAG}+\\mathrm{Na}\\right]^{+}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.955}$$", "id": "2574501"}]}
