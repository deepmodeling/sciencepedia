The definitions for plate height, $H$, and plate number, $N$, are standard. The use of a Gaussian model for peak shape is a common and valid approximation. The linear relationship $x = u\\,t$ is a correct assumption for ideal chromatography. A minor imprecision exists in the descriptive text for baseline width (\"width between the points where the Gaussian returns to baseline\"), as a true Gaussian function only asymptotically approaches the baseline. However, the problem immediately rectifies this by providing the explicit, quantitative definition $w_{b} = 4\\,\\sigma_{t}$, which is the standard convention in the field. This makes the problem well-posed and unambiguous. The provided data are complete, consistent, and physically realistic. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be constructed.\n\nThe objective is to find the plate number, $N$. We begin with the provided definitions:\n$$N = \\frac{L}{H}$$\n$$H = \\frac{\\sigma_{x}^{2}}{L}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $H$ into the expression for $N$ yields an alternative formula for the plate number in terms of the column length $L$ and the spatial variance $\\sigma_{x}^{2}$:\n$$N = \\frac{L}{(\\sigma_{x}^{2}/L)} = \\frac{L^{2}}{\\sigma_{x}^{2}}$$\nThis equation expresses $N$ using variance in the spatial domain (units of length squared). The measured quantity, $w_{b}$, is in the time domain. A transformation between these domains is required. The problem states the relationship between the spatial coordinate $x$ and the time coordinate $t$ is linear:\n$$x = u\\,t$$\nwhere $u$ is the constant linear velocity. For a distribution described by a random variable, this linear transformation relates the variances in the two domains as follows:\n$$\\sigma_{x}^{2} = \\mathrm{Var}(x) = \\mathrm{Var}(u\\,t) = u^{2}\\mathrm{Var}(t) = u^{2}\\sigma_{t}^{2}$$\nNow, we must relate the temporal variance, $\\sigma_{t}^{2}$, to the given observable, $w_{b}$. The problem specifies the relationship for a Gaussian peak:\n$$w_{b} = 4\\,\\sigma_{t}$$\nFrom this, we solve for the temporal standard deviation, $\\sigma_{t}$, and the temporal variance, $\\sigma_{t}^{2}$:\n$$\\sigma_{t} = \\frac{w_{b}}{4}$$\n$$\\sigma_{t}^{2} = \\left(\\frac{w_{b}}{4}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{w_{b}^{2}}{16}$$\nNow we substitute this expression for $\\sigma_{t}^{2}$ into our equation relating spatial and temporal variances:\n$$\\sigma_{x}^{2} = u^{2} \\left(\\frac{w_{b}^{2}}{16}\\right) = \\frac{u^{2}w_{b}^{2}}{16}$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for the spatial variance $\\sigma_{x}^{2}$ into our equation for the plate number $N$:\n$$N = \\frac{L^{2}}{\\sigma_{x}^{2}} = \\frac{L^{2}}{(u^{2}w_{b}^{2}/16)}$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the desired relationship for $N$ in terms of $L$, $u$, and $w_{b}$:\n$$N = 16\\left(\\frac{L}{u w_{b}}\\right)^{2}$$\nThis completes the derivation of the symbolic expression.\n\nThe next step is to compute the numerical value of $N$ using the provided data:\n$L = 0.1000\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$u = 0.002000\\ \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$w_{b} = 5.000\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n\nFirst, we compute the product $u w_{b}$:\n$$u w_{b} = (0.002000\\ \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (5.000\\ \\mathrm{s}) = 0.01000\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nThe units correctly result in meters, which matches the units of $L$.\nNow, we substitute the values into the derived expression for $N$:\n$$N = 16\\left(\\frac{0.1000\\ \\mathrm{m}}{0.01000\\ \\mathrm{m}}\\right)^{2}$$\nThe ratio inside the parentheses is dimensionless:\n$$\\frac{0.1000}{0.01000} = 10.00$$\nContinuing the calculation for $N$:\n$$N = 16 \\times (10.00)^{2} = 16 \\times 100.0 = 1600$$\nThe input values $L$, $u$, and $w_{b}$ are all given to four significant figures.

The task is a standard textbook exercise designed to test the understanding of the factors controlling chromatographic resolution.\n\nStep 3: Verdict.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be constructed.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts as requested.\n\n1) Derivation of the resolution expression.\nWe begin with the provided definition of chromatographic resolution, $R_{s}$:\n$$R_{s} = \\dfrac{t_{R,2} - t_{R,1}}{\\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(w_{b,1} + w_{b,2}\\right)}$$\nThe numerator represents the separation of peak maxima. Using the given relation $t_{R,i} = t_{0}\\,(1 + k_{i})$, the numerator becomes:\n$$t_{R,2} - t_{R,1} = t_{0}(1+k_{2}) - t_{0}(1+k_{1}) = t_{0}(k_{2} - k_{1})$$\nThe denominator represents the average peak width. First, we must express the baseline width, $w_{b,i}$, in terms of the plate count, $N_i$. From the definition $N_{i} = (t_{R,i}/\\sigma_{i})^{2}$, we find the standard deviation $\\sigma_{i} = t_{R,i}/\\sqrt{N_{i}}$. Substituting this into the expression for baseline width, $w_{b,i} = 4\\sigma_{i}$, yields:\n$$w_{b,i} = \\frac{4t_{R,i}}{\\sqrt{N_{i}}}$$\nNow, we use this expression in the denominator of the resolution equation, applying the stated assumption that $N_{1} = N_{2} = N$:\n$$\\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(w_{b,1} + w_{b,2}\\right) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{4t_{R,1}}{\\sqrt{N}} + \\frac{4t_{R,2}}{\\sqrt{N}}\\right) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{N}}(t_{R,1} + t_{R,2})$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the numerator and the denominator back into the resolution equation gives:\n$$R_{s} = \\dfrac{t_{0}(k_{2} - k_{1})}{\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{N}}(t_{R,1} + t_{R,2})} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{2} \\frac{t_{0}(k_{2} - k_{1})}{t_{R,1} + t_{R,2}}$$\nTo express $R_{s}$ solely in terms of $N$, $k_1$, and $\\alpha$, we substitute $t_{R,i} = t_{0}(1+k_i)$ into the denominator of this intermediate expression:\n$$t_{R,1} + t_{R,2} = t_{0}(1+k_{1}) + t_{0}(1+k_{2}) = t_{0}(2 + k_{1} + k_{2})$$\nThis leads to:\n$$R_{s} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{2} \\frac{t_{0}(k_{2} - k_{1})}{t_{0}(2 + k_{1} + k_{2})} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{2} \\frac{k_{2} - k_{1}}{2 + k_{1} + k_{2}}$$\nFinally, we introduce the selectivity factor $\\alpha = k_{2}/k_{1}$, which means $k_{2} = \\alpha k_{1}$. Substituting this into the equation yields the final expression:\n$$R_{s} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{2} \\frac{\\alpha k_{1} - k_{1}}{2 + k_{1} + \\alpha k_{1}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{2} \\frac{k_{1}(\\alpha-1)}{2 + k_{1}(1+\\alpha)}$$\nThis is the required expression for $R_{s}$ derived strictly from the provided definitions.\n\n2) Explanation of the primacy of selectivity, $\\alpha$.\nThe derived expression for resolution is a product of terms related to column efficiency ($N$), analyte retention ($k_1$), and selectivity ($\\alpha$):\n$$R_{s} = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{k_{1}}{2 + k_{1}(1+\\alpha)}\\right) \\left(\\alpha-1\\right)$$\nCoelution, by definition, means the analytes have identical retention times, and therefore identical capacity factors: $k_{1} = k_{2}$. The selectivity factor $\\alpha = k_{2}/k_{1}$ is thus precisely equal to $1$.\nIf we substitute $\\alpha=1$ into the derived expression for resolution:\n$$R_{s} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{2} \\frac{k_{1}(1-1)}{2 + k_{1}(1+1)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{2} \\frac{k_{1} \\cdot 0}{2 + 2k_{1}} = 0$$\nThis result is definitive. The resolution is zero regardless of the values of the plate count $N$ or the capacity factor $k_1$, as long as they are finite. The term $(\\alpha-1)$ acts as a multiplicative switch for separation. If $\\alpha=1$, this term is zero, forcing the entire product, $R_s$, to be zero. One can imagine infinitely efficient columns ($N \\to \\infty$) producing infinitesimally narrow peaks, but if there is no selectivity ($\\alpha=1$), these peaks will still be perfectly superimposed, resulting in zero resolution. Therefore, to achieve any separation at all (i.e., to make $R_{s} > 0$), it is an absolute necessity to make $\\alpha \\neq 1$. Increasing $N$ or optimizing $k$ are secondary adjustments that improve an existing separation; they are powerless to create separation from a state of complete coelution. The establishment of selectivity ($\\alpha > 1$) is the fundamental prerequisite.\n\n3) Quantitative evaluation of resolution.\nWe use the derived expression from part (1) and substitute the provided numerical values: $N = 16000$, $k_{1} = 2.00$, and the new selectivity factor $\\alpha = 1.05$.\nThe expression is:\n$$R_{s} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{2} \\frac{k_{1}(\\alpha-1)}{2 + k_{1}(1+\\alpha)}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$R_{s} = \\frac{\\sqrt{16000}}{2} \\frac{2.00(1.05-1)}{2 + 2.00(1+1.05)}$$\nWe calculate the terms separately. The square root of the plate count is:\n$$\\sqrt{16000} = \\sqrt{1600 \\times 10} = 40\\sqrt{10} \\approx 126.4911$$\nThe numerator of the fractional term is:\n$$2.00(1.05-1) = 2.00(0.05) = 0.100$$\nThe denominator of the fractional term is:\n$$2 + 2.00(1+1.05) = 2 + 2.00(2.05) = 2 + 4.10 = 6.10$$\nCombining these results:\n$$R_{s} = \\frac{126.4911}{2} \\left(\\frac{0.100}{6.10}\\right) \\approx 63.24555 \\times 0.01639344 \\approx 1.03669$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required, we obtain the final numerical answer for the resolution.\n$$R_s \\approx 1.037$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.037}$$", "id": "2589559"}, {"introduction": "This final practice integrates the principles of efficiency, retention, selectivity, and system hydrodynamics into a comprehensive, systems-level approach to method development.

Substituting these relationships into the resolution equation:\n$$\nR_s = \\frac{2(t_0(1+k_2) - t_0(1+k_1))}{\\frac{4 t_0(1+k_1)}{\\sqrt{N}} + \\frac{4 t_0(1+k_2)}{\\sqrt{N}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{2} \\frac{k_2 - k_1}{2 + k_1 + k_2}\n$$\nHere, we designate analyte $2$ as the later-eluting species, so $k_2 = k_{\\text{late}}$ and $k_1 = k_{\\text{early}}$. By definition, the selectivity is $\\alpha = \\frac{k_{\\text{late}}}{k_{\\text{early}}}$, which implies $k_{\\text{early}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{late}}}{\\alpha}$. Substituting these into the equation yields:\n$$\nR_s = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{2} \\frac{k_{\\text{late}} - \\frac{k_{\\text{late}}}{\\alpha}}{2 + \\frac{k_{\\text{late}}}{\\alpha} + k_{\\text{late}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{2} \\frac{k_{\\text{late}} \\left(1-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\right)}{2 + k_{\\text{late}}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\right)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{2} \\frac{k_{\\text{late}} \\left(\\frac{\\alpha-1}{\\alpha}\\right)}{2 + k_{\\text{late}}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha+1}{\\alpha}\\right)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{2} \\frac{k_{\\text{late}}(\\alpha-1)}{2\\alpha + k_{\\text{late}}(\\alpha+1)}\n$$\nThis is a valid expression. However, a further, very common approximation simplifies this into the well-known Purnell equation. This approximation is that in the denominator term, since the peaks are close, their retention factors are similar, $k_{\\text{early}} \\approx k_{\\text{late}}$. This simplifies $2+k_{\\text{early}}+k_{\\text{late}} \\approx 2 + 2k_{\\text{late}} = 2(1+k_{\\text{late}})$. Applying this approximation:\n$$\nR_s \\approx \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{2} \\frac{k_{\\text{late}} - k_{\\text{early}}}{2(1+k_{\\text{late}})} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{4} \\frac{k_{\\text{late}} - \\frac{k_{\\text{late}}}{\\alpha}}{1+k_{\\text{late}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{4} \\frac{k_{\\text{late}}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\right)}{1+k_{\\text{late}}}\n$$\nThis leads to the final, canonical form of the Purnell equation that we will use for computation:\n$$\nR_s(N, \\alpha, k_{\\text{late}}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{4} \\left(\\frac{\\alpha-1}{\\alpha}\\right) \\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{late}}}{1+k_{\\text{late}}}\\right)\n$$\n\nNext, we assemble the complete system of equations required to map the design space. The independent variables are the superficial velocity $u$ and the mobile phase organic volume-fraction $\\phi$.\n\n1.  **Plate Number, $N(u)$**: The plate number depends on the interstitial velocity $u_i = u/\\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon$ is the bed porosity. Using the given van Deemter relationship for plate height $H(u_i)$ and the column length $L$:\n    $$\n    H(u_i) = A + \\frac{B}{u_i} + C u_i = A + \\frac{B \\varepsilon}{u} + \\frac{C u}{\\varepsilon}\n    $$\n    $$\n    N(u) = \\frac{L}{H(u)} = \\frac{L}{A + \\frac{B \\varepsilon}{u} + \\frac{C u}{\\varepsilon}}\n    $$\n    Note that $N$ is only a function of $u$ for a given column packing.\n\n2.  **Retention and Selectivity, $k_i(\\phi), \\alpha(\\phi)$**: The retention factors for the two analytes are given by the Linear Solvent Strength model:\n    $$\n    \\log_{10} k_1(\\phi) = \\log_{10} k_{0,1} - S_1 \\phi \\implies k_1(\\phi) = 10^{\\log_{10} k_{0,1} - S_1 \\phi}\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\log_{10} k_2(\\phi) = \\log_{10} k_{0,2} - S_2 \\phi \\implies k_2(\\phi) = 10^{\\log_{10} k_{0,2} - S_2 \\phi}\n    $$\n    From these, we determine the later-eluting species and the selectivity at each value of $\\phi$:\n    $$\n    k_{\\text{late}}(\\phi) = \\max\\{k_1(\\phi), k_2(\\phi)\\}\n    $$\n    $$\n    k_{\\text{early}}(\\phi) = \\min\\{k_1(\\phi), k_2(\\phi)\\}\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\alpha(\\phi) = \\frac{k_{\\text{late}}(\\phi)}{k_{\\text{early}}(\\phi)}\n    $$\n    These quantities depend only on $\\phi$.\n\n3.  **Pressure Drop, $\\Delta P(u, \\phi)$**: The pressure drop is calculated using the Kozeny-Carman equation. First, we compute the mobile phase viscosity $\\eta(\\phi)$ using the provided logarithmic mixing rule for the water-acetonitrile mixture:\n    $$\n    \\ln \\eta(\\phi) = (1 - \\phi) \\ln \\eta_w + \\phi \\ln \\eta_a \\implies \\eta(\\phi) = \\exp\\left((1 - \\phi) \\ln \\eta_w + \\phi \\ln \\eta_a\\right)\n    $$\n    The geometric factor $f(\\varepsilon)$ is constant for a given column:\n    $$\n    f(\\varepsilon) = 180 \\frac{(1-\\varepsilon)^2}{\\varepsilon^3}\n    $$\n    The pressure drop is then:\n    $$\n    \\Delta P(u, \\phi) = f(\\varepsilon) \\, \\eta(\\phi) \\, \\frac{L}{d_p^2} \\, u\n    $$\n    where $d_p$ is the particle diameter.\n\n4.  **Computational Procedure**: For each test case, we construct a uniform grid in the $(u, \\phi)$ plane. At each grid point:\n    a. Calculate $N(u)$ from the grid value of $u$.\n    b. Calculate $k_1(\\phi)$, $k_2(\\phi)$, $k_{\\text{late}}(\\phi)$, and $\\alpha(\\phi)$ from the grid value of $\\phi$.\n    c. Combine these to find the resolution $R_s(u, \\phi)$ using the Purnell equation.\n    d. Calculate $\\eta(\\phi)$ from the grid value of $\\phi$.\n    e. Combine to find the pressure drop $\\Delta P(u, \\phi)$.\n    f. A grid point is considered part of the valid design space if and only if both constraints are met: $R_s(u, \\phi) \\geq 1.5$ and $\\Delta P(u, \\phi) \\leq 6 \\times 10^7$ Pa.\n    g. The final result for the test case is the fraction of total grid points that satisfy these two conditions. This is calculated by summing the valid points and dividing by the total number of points in the grid.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the chromatographic design space problem for multiple test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Test cases defined in the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            # Test case 1\n            \"L\": 0.10, \"dp\": 1.7e-6, \"eps\": 0.40,\n            \"A\": 2.0e-6, \"B\": 1.6e-9, \"C\": 4.0e-3,\n            \"logk0_1\": 1.30, \"S1\": 3.00,\n            \"logk0_2\": 1.60, \"S2\": 4.00,\n            \"eta_w\": 8.90e-4, \"eta_a\": 3.70e-4,\n            \"phi_range\": (0.10, 0.60, 41),\n            \"u_range\": (2.0e-4, 1.2e-3, 41),\n        },\n        {\n            # Test case 2\n            \"L\": 0.050, \"dp\": 1.7e-6, \"eps\": 0.40,\n            \"A\": 2.0e-6, \"B\": 1.6e-9, \"C\": 4.0e-3,\n            \"logk0_1\": 1.30, \"S1\": 3.00,\n            \"logk0_2\": 1.60, \"S2\": 4.00,\n            \"eta_w\": 8.90e-4, \"eta_a\": 3.70e-4,\n            \"phi_range\": (0.10, 0.60, 41),\n            \"u_range\": (2.0e-4, 1.2e-3, 41),\n        },\n        {\n            # Test case 3\n            \"L\": 0.10, \"dp\": 2.6e-6, \"eps\": 0.40,\n            \"A\": 3.0e-6, \"B\": 2.0e-9, \"C\": 3.0e-3,\n            \"logk0_1\": 1.30, \"S1\": 3.00,\n            \"logk0_2\": 1.60, \"S2\": 4.00,\n            \"eta_w\": 8.90e-4, \"eta_a\": 3.70e-4,\n            \"phi_range\": (0.05, 0.60, 36),\n            \"u_range\": (3.0e-4, 1.5e-3, 41),\n        },\n        {\n            # Test case 4\n            \"L\": 0.10, \"dp\": 1.7e-6, \"eps\": 0.40,\n            \"A\": 2.0e-6, \"B\": 1.6e-9, \"C\": 4.0e-3,\n            \"logk0_1\": 1.40, \"S1\": 3.20,\n            \"logk0_2\": 1.41, \"S2\": 3.30,\n            \"eta_w\": 8.90e-4, \"eta_a\": 3.70e-4,\n            \"phi_range\": (0.05, 0.60, 36),\n            \"u_range\": (2.0e-4, 1.0e-3, 41),\n        },\n    ]\n\n    # Constraints\n    RS_MIN = 1.5\n    DP_MAX = 6e7  # 600 bar in Pascals\n\n    results = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        # Unpack parameters\n        L, dp, eps = case[\"L\"], case[\"dp\"], case[\"eps\"]\n        A, B, C = case[\"A\"], case[\"B\"], case[\"C\"]\n        logk0_1, S1 = case[\"logk0_1\"], case[\"S1\"]\n        logk0_2, S2 = case[\"logk0_2\"], case[\"S2\"]\n        eta_w, eta_a = case[\"eta_w\"], case[\"eta_a\"]\n        \n        # Construct grid\n        phi_vec = np.linspace(*case[\"phi_range\"])\n        u_vec = np.linspace(*case[\"u_range\"])\n        U, PHI = np.meshgrid(u_vec, phi_vec)\n\n        # 1.
