No rounding is required if an exact value is obtained.", "solution": "We begin from the central dogma of molecular biology, wherein codons (triplets of nucleotides) specify amino acids via the standard genetic code. Degeneracy in the code arises because multiple codons can encode the same amino acid. Degenerate primer schemes use International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) ambiguity codes to specify mixtures of nucleotides at given positions. The IUPAC codes used here are: $N$ denotes any nucleotide $\\{A, C, G, T\\}$, $K$ denotes $\\{G, T\\}$, and $S$ denotes $\\{G, C\\}$. We assume independent and uniform sampling of the allowed nucleotides at each degenerate position, which implies that each codon permitted by the degeneracy scheme has equal probability.\n\nDefinition and codon counts:\n- $\\text{NNK}$: the codon pattern is $N$ at position $1$, $N$ at position $2$, and $K$ at position $3$, so the number of distinct codons sampled is $4 \\times 4 \\times 2 = 32$.\n- $\\text{NNS}$: the codon pattern is $N$ at position $1$, $N$ at position $2$, and $S$ at position $3$, so the number of distinct codons sampled is $4 \\times 4 \\times 2 = 32$.\n\nThus, both $\\text{NNK}$ and $\\text{NNS}$ yield $32$ equiprobable codons at the site, each with probability $1/32$.\n\nWe next derive, for each scheme, the induced amino acid and stop frequencies by counting how many codons among the $32$ map to each outcome under the standard genetic code. We use the stated degeneracy structure and the constraint on the third base for each scheme.\n\nKey observation: For any amino acid codon family, only those family members whose third base belongs to the allowed set ($\\{G, T\\}$ for $\\text{NNK}$ and $\\{G, C\\}$ for $\\text{NNS}$) are included. For families in which the third base partitions into two disjoint subsets (e.g., pyrimidine versus purine or specific bases), the number included under $\\text{NNK}$ versus $\\text{NNS}$ is determined by how many family members have third base $G$ or $T$ (for $\\text{NNK}$) versus $G$ or $C$ (for $\\text{NNS}$).\n\nWe enumerate by family type:\n\n- Six-codon families: leucine, serine, arginine. Each is composed of a fourfold-degenerate box (e.g., $\\text{TCN}$ for serine) contributing $2$ codons under either $\\text{NNK}$ (third base $G$ or $T$) or $\\text{NNS}$ (third base $G$ or $C$), plus a separate two-codon family with third base restricted to $\\{C, T\\}$ or $\\{A, G\\}$ depending on the amino acid. For serine, the extra two-codon family is $\\text{AGY}$ ($Y \\in \\{C, T\\}$), which contributes $1$ codon under either scheme (third base $T$ for $\\text{NNK}$ and $C$ for $\\text{NNS}$). For arginine, the extra two-codon family is $\\text{AGR}$ ($R \\in \\{A, G\\}$), which contributes the $\\text{AGG}$ codon under both $\\text{NNK}$ and $\\text{NNS}$ (third base $G$ is included in both). For leucine, the extra two-codon family is $\\text{TTR}$ ($R \\in \\{A, G\\}$), which contributes the $\\text{TTG}$ codon (third base $G$) under both schemes. In total, each six-codon family contributes $3$ codons under both $\\text{NNK}$ and $\\text{NNS}$. Therefore, for leucine, serine, and arginine, each frequency is $3/32$.\n\n- Four-codon families: valine, proline, threonine, alanine, glycine. Each has four codons differing only at the third base; under $\\text{NNK}$ the allowed third bases $\\{G, T\\}$ include exactly $2$ of these; under $\\text{NNS}$ the allowed third bases $\\{G, C\\}$ also include exactly $2$. Thus each of these five amino acids has frequency $2/32$.\n\n- Three-codon family: isoleucine has codons $\\text{ATT}$, $\\text{ATC}$, $\\text{ATA}$. Under $\\text{NNK}$ the allowed third bases $\\{G, T\\}$ intersect this set only at $T$ ($\\text{ATT}$), giving $1$ codon. Under $\\text{NNS}$ the allowed third bases $\\{G, C\\}$ intersect only at $C$ ($\\text{ATC}$), giving $1$ codon. Thus isoleucine has frequency $1/32$ under both schemes.\n\n- Two-codon families: phenylalanine ($\\text{TTY}$), tyrosine ($\\text{TAY}$), cysteine ($\\text{TGY}$), histidine ($\\text{CAY}$), glutamine ($\\text{CAR}$), asparagine ($\\text{AAY}$), lysine ($\\text{AAR}$), aspartate ($\\text{GAY}$), glutamate ($\\text{GAR}$). In each case, the two codons differ at the third base between one purine and one pyrimidine. $\\text{NNK}$ allows third base $\\{G, T\\}$, which captures exactly one of the two; $\\text{NNS}$ allows third base $\\{G, C\\}$, also capturing exactly one of the two. Therefore, each of these nine amino acids has frequency $1/32$ under both schemes.\n\n- One-codon families: methionine ($\\text{ATG}$) and tryptophan ($\\text{TGG}$). Both have third base $G$, which is allowed in both $\\text{NNK}$ and $\\text{NNS}$. Hence each has frequency $1/32$.\n\n- Stop codons: $\\text{TAA}$, $\\text{TAG}$, $\\text{TGA}$. Under $\\text{NNK}$ the allowed third bases are $\\{G, T\\}$, so among the stops only $\\text{TAG}$ (third base $G$) is included, contributing $1$ codon and a stop frequency of $1/32$. Under $\\text{NNS}$ the allowed third bases are $\\{G, C\\}$, so again only $\\text{TAG}$ is included, also giving a stop frequency of $1/32$.\n\nCollecting the frequencies, under both $\\text{NNK}$ and $\\text{NNS}$ we obtain identical outcome frequencies:\n- For leucine, serine, arginine: $3/32$ each.\n- For valine, proline, threonine, alanine, glycine: $2/32$ each.\n- For phenylalanine, tyrosine, cysteine, histidine, glutamine, asparagine, lysine, aspartate, glutamate: $1/32$ each.\n- For isoleucine, methionine, tryptophan: $1/32$ each.\n- Stop: $1/32$.\n\nLet $P_{\\mathrm{NNK}}$ and $Q_{\\mathrm{NNS}}$ denote the categorical distributions over the $21$ outcomes as above. The Kullback–Leibler divergence is defined as\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{KL}}(P_{\\mathrm{NNK}} \\Vert Q_{\\mathrm{NNS}}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{21} p_i \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{p_i}{q_i}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $p_i$ and $q_i$ are the probabilities of outcome $i$ under $\\text{NNK}$ and $\\text{NNS}$, respectively, and $\\ln$ is the natural logarithm.\n\nSince we have shown $p_i = q_i$ for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, 21\\}$, each term is $p_i \\ln(1) = 0$, and therefore\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{KL}}(P_{\\mathrm{NNK}} \\Vert Q_{\\mathrm{NNS}}) = 0.\n$$\nThis is an exact value in natural units (nats), so no rounding is required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2591051"}, {"introduction": "A theoretically perfect library is only as good as its expression and translation within a living host.

The team plans to screen variants for activity and wishes to minimize non-biological selection arising from translation bottlenecks. Consider the following well-tested facts and definitions as the starting base for your reasoning: (i) Translation elongation rate in bacteria is limited by cognate transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) availability for each codon, and codon usage bias reflects the relative abundance of tRNAs; rare codons are decoded more slowly and can reduce protein yield.

It provides sufficient, consistent, and objective information to derive a solution. No invalidating flaws are present.\n\nThe core of the problem is to analyze the expression bias introduced by a saturation mutagenesis library constructed using the $\\text{NNK}$ degenerate codon scheme in *Escherichia coli* and to identify the best codon compression strategy among the given options to mitigate this bias.\n\nFirst, let us analyze the $\\text{NNK}$ codon library. The IUPAC code $N$ represents any of the $4$ bases ($A$, $C$, $G$, or $T$), and $K$ represents $G$ or $T$. Thus, an $\\text{NNK}$ codon has $4$ possibilities for the first position, $4$ for the second, and $2$ for the third, resulting in a total of $4 \\times 4 \\times 2 = 32$ unique codons. These $32$ codons are sampled uniformly, each with a probability of $1/32$.\n\nThe $32$ $\\text{NNK}$ codons are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Codons ending in $G$: $\\text{AAG}(\\text{Lys})$, $\\text{ACG}(\\text{Thr})$, $\\text{AGG}(\\text{Arg})$, $\\text{ATG}(\\text{Met})$, $\\text{CAG}(\\text{Gln})$, $\\text{CCG}(\\text{Pro})$, $\\text{CGG}(\\text{Arg})$, $\\text{CTG}(\\text{Leu})$, $\\text{GAG}(\\text{Glu})$, $\\text{GCG}(\\text{Ala})$, $\\text{GGG}(\\text{Gly})$, $\\text{GTG}(\\text{Val})$, $\\text{TAG}(\\text{STOP})$, $\\text{TCG}(\\text{Ser})$, $\\text{TGG}(\\text{Trp})$, $\\text{TTG}(\\text{Leu})$.\n    \\item Codons ending in $T$: $\\text{AAT}(\\text{Asn})$, $\\text{ACT}(\\text{Thr})$, $\\text{AGT}(\\text{Ser})$, $\\text{ATT}(\\text{Ile})$, $\\text{CAT}(\\text{His})$, $\\text{CCT}(\\text{Pro})$, $\\text{CGT}(\\text{Arg})$, $\\text{CTT}(\\text{Leu})$, $\\text{GAT}(\\text{Asp})$, $\\text{GCT}(\\text{Ala})$, $\\text{GGT}(\\text{Gly})$, $\\text{GTT}(\\text{Val})$, $\\text{TAT}(\\text{Tyr})$, $\\text{TCT}(\\text{Ser})$, $\\text{TGT}(\\text{Cys})$, $\\text{TTT}(\\text{Phe})$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThis scheme encodes all $20$ standard amino acids and $1$ stop codon, $\\text{TAG}$. The distribution of amino acids is not uniform: $Leu$, $Arg$, and $Ser$ are encoded by $3$ codons each; $Ala$, $Gly$, $Pro$, $Thr$, and $Val$ are encoded by $2$ codons each; a majority of amino acids are encoded by a single codon.\n\nAccording to the provided facts, two main factors will skew protein expression from this library:\n$1$. The presence of the amber stop codon $\\text{TAG}$ at a frequency of $1/32$. As stated in fact (iv), this leads to translation termination in wild-type strains or reduced yield of full-length protein in suppressor strains.\n$2$. The presence of rare codons. Fact (i) states that rare codons are decoded slowly, reducing protein yield. Fact (iii) lists specific rare codons in *E. coli*. Let's check which of these rare codons are present in the $\\text{NNK}$ library:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item Arginine ($Arg$): $\\text{AGA}$ (not in $\\text{NNK}$), $\\text{AGG}$ (in $\\text{NNK}$), $\\text{CGG}$ (in $\\text{NNK}$). The library is heavily biased towards rare $Arg$ codons.\n        \\item Isoleucine ($Ile$): $\\text{ATA}$ (not in $\\text{NNK}$). The $\\text{NNK}$ codon for $Ile$ is $\\text{ATT}$, which is common.\n        \\item Leucine ($Leu$): $\\text{CTA}$ (not in $\\text{NNK}$).\n        \\item Proline ($Pro$): $\\text{CCC}$ (not in $\\text{NNK}$).\n        \\item Glycine ($Gly$): $\\text{GGA}$ (not in $\\text{NNK}$).\n        \\item Serine ($Ser$): $\\text{TCG}$ (in $\\text{NNK}$).\n    \\end{itemize}\nThe primary sources of expression bias in an $\\text{NNK}$ library are therefore the $\\text{TAG}$ stop codon and the rare codons $\\text{AGG}$, $\\text{CGG}$, and $\\text{TCG}$. The rare arginine codons are particularly problematic. The goal of a compression strategy is to eliminate these features while maintaining coverage of all $20$ amino acids.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option:\n\nA. This option states that $\\text{NNK}$ disproportionately samples rare arginine codons $\\text{AGG}$ and $\\text{CGG}$ and includes $\\text{TAG}$, leading to underexpression or truncation. This diagnosis is correct, as established by our analysis. It proposes a compression to a $22$-codon scheme derived from $\\text{NDT}$, $\\text{VHG}$, and $\\text{TGG}$. Let's analyze this proposed scheme.\n- $\\text{NDT}$: $N(A/C/G/T)$, $D(A/G/T)$, $T(T)$. This gives $4 \\times 3 \\times 1 = 12$ codons.\n  - $\\text{AAT}(\\text{Asn})$, $\\text{AGT}(\\text{Ser})$, $\\text{ATT}(\\text{Ile})$\n  - $\\text{CAT}(\\text{His})$, $\\text{CGT}(\\text{Arg})$, $\\text{CTT}(\\text{Leu})$\n  - $\\text{GAT}(\\text{Asp})$, $\\text{GGT}(\\text{Gly})$, $\\text{GTT}(\\text{Val})$\n  - $\\text{TAT}(\\text{Tyr})$, $\\text{TGT}(\\text{Cys})$, $\\text{TTT}(\\text{Phe})$\n  This set of $12$ codons encodes $12$ different amino acids: $Asn, Ser, Ile, His, Arg, Leu, Asp, Gly, Val, Tyr, Cys, Phe$.\n- $\\text{VHG}$: $V(A/C/G)$, $H(A/C/T)$, $G(G)$. This gives $3 \\times 3 \\times 1 = 9$ codons.\n  - $\\text{AAG}(\\text{Lys})$, $\\text{ACG}(\\text{Thr})$, $\\text{ATG}(\\text{Met})$\n  - $\\text{CAG}(\\text{Gln})$, $\\text{CCG}(\\text{Pro})$, $\\text{CTG}(\\text{Leu})$\n  - $\\text{GAG}(\\text{Glu})$, $\\text{GCG}(\\text{Ala})$, $\\text{GTG}(\\text{Val})$\n  This set of $9$ codons encodes $9$ different amino acids: $Lys, Thr, Met, Gln, Pro, Leu, Glu, Ala, Val$.\n- $\\text{TGG}$ encodes Tryptophan ($Trp$).\nThe total set of amino acids covered is the union of these three sets: $\\{Asn, Ser, Ile, His, Arg, Leu, Asp, Gly, Val, Tyr, Cys, Phe\\} \\cup \\{Lys, Thr, Met, Gln, Pro, Leu, Glu, Ala, Val\\} \\cup \\{Trp\\}$. This union contains all $20$ standard amino acids. The claim of \"coverage of $20$ amino acids\" is correct.\nThe total number of unique codons is $12 (\\text{NDT}) + 9 (\\text{VHG}) + 1 (\\text{TGG}) = 22$. $Leu$ and $Val$ are encoded by two codons each, while the other $18$ amino acids are encoded by one codon each. This constitutes \"near-uniform coverage\".\nThis scheme removes all stop codons ($\\text{TAA}, \\text{TAG}, \\text{TGA}$) and all rare codons listed in fact (iii) ($\\text{AGA}, \\text{AGG}, \\text{CGG}, \\text{ATA}, \\text{CTA}, \\text{CCC}, \\text{GGA}, \\text{TCG}$). The claim that it \"removes stops and excludes the rare $\\text{AGG}$ and $\\text{CGG}$\" is correct.\nThis option correctly identifies the problem and proposes a known, effective, and accurately described solution.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. This option claims $\\text{NNK}$ samples all amino acids equally. This is false. As shown above, $Leu$, $Arg$, and $Ser$ are sampled $3$ times more frequently than $Met$ or $Trp$. It also claims $\\text{NNK}$ is insensitive to codon usage, which directly contradicts facts (i) and (iii). Consequently, the conclusion that expression levels will be uniform is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. This option claims $\\text{NNK}$ under-represents leucine because only $\\text{CTG}$ is included. This is false. Our analysis shows $\\text{NNK}$ encodes leucine with three codons: $\\text{CTG}$, $\\text{CTT}$, and $\\text{TTG}$. It then proposes switching to $\\text{NNS}$ ($S=G/C$). $\\text{NNS}$ generates $4 \\times 4 \\times 2 = 32$ codons. Let's check for $\\text{TAG}$. For $\\text{TAG}$, the third base is $G$. Since $S$ can be $G$, $\\text{NNS}$ *does* generate the $\\text{TAG}$ stop codon. The claim that $\\text{NNS}$ \"remove[s] $\\text{TAG}$\" is false. Furthermore, $\\text{NNS}$ would generate the rare arginine codon $\\text{CGG}$ and the rare proline codon $\\text{CCC}$ (which $\\text{NNK}$ avoids), so it does not \"restore balanced expression\".\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. This option claims the main skew in $\\text{NNK}$ arises from glycine $\\text{GGA}$. This is false. $\\text{NNK}$ produces $\\text{GGG}$ and $\\text{GGT}$ for glycine, but not the rare codon $\\text{GGA}$. The main skew comes from the $\\text{TAG}$ stop codon and rare arginine codons. It then proposes using $\\text{NDT}$ alone. As analyzed under option A, $\\text{NDT}$ encodes only $12$ of the $20$ amino acids. The claim that $\\text{NDT}$ alone can \"cover all $20$ amino acids\" is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, Option A provides a correct assessment of the problem with the $\\text{NNK}$ library and proposes a valid and accurately described strategy to resolve the issues.

Start with position $61$, then $120$, then $84$, then $178$. ISM reduces combinatorial library size that scales roughly as $32^k$ for $k$ sites, which otherwise exceeds $S_{\\max}$ for multi-site coverage (e.g., two-site coverage at $3 \\times$ requires about $3{,}072$ clones, exceeding $1.5 \\times 10^3$). A greedy ISM path should prioritize sites with the largest expected per-clone improvement, which under multiplicative fitness can be approximated by ranking $f_i \\ln m_i$, and it also leverages improved parents to reveal favorable epistasis.\n\nB. Start with position $84$, then $120$, then $61$, then $178$. Because a UAA may eventually be installed at position $84$, ISM should begin there to pre-adapt the site for suppression; enrichment fractions are less relevant than UAA plans.\n\nC. Start with position $61$, then $84$, then $120$, then $178$.

This is well within the stated maximum screening throughput of $S_{\\max} = 1.5 \\times 10^3$ clones.\n\nHowever, if one were to construct a combinatorial library saturating $k$ positions simultaneously, the library size would scale as $L_k = 32^k$.\nFor $k=2$ positions, the library size is $L_2 = 32^2 = 1024$. The required screening effort is $N_2 = 3 \\times 1024 = 3072$ clones. This value, $3072$, exceeds the maximum throughput $S_{\\max} = 1.5 \\times 10^3$.\nFor all $k=4$ positions, the library size explodes to $L_4 = 32^4 = 1,048,576$. Screening this library with $3 \\times$ coverage would require over $3 \\times 10^6$ clones, which is completely unfeasible.\n\nTherefore, creating and screening a combinatorial library of even two sites is beyond the specified capacity. ISM circumvents this combinatorial explosion by exploring the sequence space iteratively, one position at a time. A single SSM library is created and screened, the best variant is identified, and this improved variant then serves as the genetic background (parent) for the next round of SSM at a different position. This sequential approach keeps the library size for each round manageable ($L_1 = 32$), ensuring it can be adequately sampled within the throughput limit of $S_{\\max} = 1.5 \\times 10^3$.\n\nPart 2: Principled Ordering of Positions for ISM\n\nISM is a greedy algorithm. The choice of which position to mutagenize first is critical, as it determines the starting point and subsequent trajectory of the evolutionary walk through sequence space. A principled strategy should aim to maximize the expected improvement at each step. We are given four metrics for each position $i$: the fraction of beneficial variants, $f_i$; the mean fold-enrichment of beneficial variants, $m_i$; the best single-substitution enrichment, $E_{\\text{best},i}$; and the distance to the active site, $d_i$.\n\nA robust metric for prioritizing sites should integrate both the probability of finding an improved variant and the expected magnitude of that improvement.\n- $f_i$ represents the \"hit rate\" or the probability of success in finding a beneficial mutation.\n- $m_i$ represents the average quality of these hits.\n- $E_{\\text{best},i}$ is a single-point estimate and can be a statistical outlier, making it a risky basis for a strategy.\n- $d_i$ is a structural heuristic, which should not supersede direct functional data when available.\n\nSince fitness effects in evolution are often multiplicative, it is appropriate to consider logarithmic fitness. The average log-enrichment of beneficial variants can be approximated by $\\ln(m_i)$. The expected improvement in log-enrichment from screening a single random clone from library $i$ is proportional to the probability of that clone being beneficial ($f_i$) multiplied by its average log-enrichment effect. We can define a progress metric, $P_i$, as:\n$$P_i = f_i \\ln(m_i)$$\nA higher value of $P_i$ suggests a greater expected gain from saturating position $i$. We now calculate this metric for each of the four positions:\n\n- Position $61$: $P_{61} = 0.30 \\times \\ln(2.6) \\approx 0.30 \\times 0.9555 \\approx 0.2867$\n- Position $84$: $P_{84} = 0.10 \\times \\ln(1.8) \\approx 0.10 \\times 0.5878 \\approx 0.0588$\n- Position $120$: $P_{120} = 0.18 \\times \\ln(2.1) \\approx 0.18 \\times 0.7419 \\approx 0.1335$\n- Position $178$: $P_{178} = 0.05 \\times \\ln(1.5) \\approx 0.05 \\times 0.4055 \\approx 0.0203$\n\nRanking the positions by descending $P_i$ value gives:\n$P_{61} (0.2867) > P_{120} (0.1335) > P_{84} (0.0588) > P_{178} (0.0203)$\nThus, the most principled greedy order for the ISM campaign is $61 \\rightarrow 120 \\rightarrow 84 \\rightarrow 178$.\n\nLet us now evaluate the provided options.\n\nA. Start with position $61$, then $120$, then $84$, then $178$. ISM reduces combinatorial library size that scales roughly as $32^k$ for $k$ sites, which otherwise exceeds $S_{\\max}$ for multi-site coverage (e.g., two-site coverage at $3 \\times$ requires about $3{,}072$ clones, exceeding $1.5 \\times 10^3$). A greedy ISM path should prioritize sites with the largest expected per-clone improvement, which under multiplicative fitness can be approximated by ranking $f_i \\ln m_i$, and it also leverages improved parents to reveal favorable epistasis.\nThis option's rationale for ISM is correct, citing the screening limitation for combinatorial libraries ($3 \\times 32^2 = 3072 > 1500$). The proposed ordering, $61 \\rightarrow 120 \\rightarrow 84 \\rightarrow 178$, matches our derivation perfectly. The justification for this ordering, prioritizing sites by ranking $f_i \\ln m_i$ as an approximation for expected improvement, is precisely the principled approach derived above. The final point about leveraging improved parents to explore epistasis is a correct and important feature of ISM.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Start with position $84$, then $120$, then $61$, then $178$. Because a UAA may eventually be installed at position $84$, ISM should begin there to pre-adapt the site for suppression; enrichment fractions are less relevant than UAA plans.\nThis option's reasoning is flawed. The primary goal is to increase catalytic turnover, not to prepare for a potential future experiment involving a photocrosslinking Unnatural Amino Acid (UAA). The information about the UAA is a distractor; it is explicitly stated that it is not used in the first rounds. Prioritizing a site based on a secondary, irrelevant goal while ignoring the direct functional data ($f_i, m_i$) related to the primary objective is poor scientific strategy.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Start with position $61$, then $84$, then $120$, then $178$. Positions should be ordered only by proximity to the active site ($d_i$ ascending), since closer residues always dominate performance regardless of observed enrichment distributions.\nThis option orders positions based on their distance $d_i$: $d_{61}=4$, $d_{84}=9$, $d_{120}=12$, $d_{178}=20$. The order $61 \\rightarrow 84 \\rightarrow 120 \\rightarrow 178$ is correct according to this criterion. However, the premise is flawed. The statement that \"closer residues always dominate performance\" is a false generalization, as allostery is a well-known phenomenon. Most critically, this strategy proposes to ignore the rich experimental enrichment data that was collected for the express purpose of guiding the evolution campaign. A principled strategy must use the available relevant data. This approach discards quantitative functional data in favor of a simplistic structural heuristic.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Skip ISM and construct a $4$-site combinatorial saturation library ($\\text{NNK}^4$) to capture epistasis immediately. Although the library nominally requires $32^4$ variants, selection will automatically find the optimal combination within $S_{\\max}$ if the best single mutants have high $E_{\\text{best},i}$ values.\nThis option is naive and demonstrates a misunderstanding of library screening statistics. As calculated, a $4$-site library has over $10^6$ variants. Screening only $S_{\\max}=1500$ clones constitutes extreme undersampling (sampling fraction $\\approx 0.15 \\%$). Selection cannot \"automatically find\" variants that are not present in the sub-sample of the library that is screened. The high values of $E_{\\text{best},i}$ from single mutants do not alter the fundamental mathematics of sampling. This strategy is statistically guaranteed to fail.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, option A provides the only correct rationale for using ISM, a sound principle for ordering the sites based on expected progress, and an ordering consistent with that principle.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2591037"}]}
