It is well-posed, providing all necessary matrices, vectors, and constants to perform Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) and Flux Variability Analysis (FVA). The constraints are consistent, and the objectives are clearly specified. The problem is valid and will be solved as stated.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in the application of linear programming to analyze stoichiometric models of metabolic networks under the steady-state assumption. This assumption, formalized by the equation $S v = 0$, dictates that the production rate of each internal metabolite equals its consumption rate, resulting in no net change in metabolite concentrations over time. Here, $S \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ is the stoichiometric matrix for a network with $m$ metabolites and $n$ reactions, and $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is the vector of reaction fluxes.\n\nThe set of feasible flux distributions is constrained by the steady-state condition and thermodynamic and physiological limits on reaction rates, expressed as lower and upper bounds, $l \\le v \\le u$. This defines a convex polytope known as the feasible flux space.\n\nFlux Balance Analysis (FBA) seeks to find a point in this feasible space that optimizes a given biological objective. This objective is typically formulated as a linear combination of fluxes, $Z = c^\\top v$, where $c$ is a vector of coefficients. A common objective is the maximization of biomass production, represented by a pseudo-reaction that consumes metabolic precursors in stoichiometrically appropriate ratios. The FBA problem is a linear program (LP):\n$$ Z^\\* = \\max_{v} \\;\\; c^\\top v \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad S v = 0, \\;\\; l \\le v \\le u $$\n\nIn many biological systems, the optimal solution to the FBA problem is not unique. This phenomenon, known as the existence of alternative optima, arises when the feasible space contains a subspace of solutions that all yield the same maximal objective value, $Z^\\*$. Analytically, alternative optima exist if there is a non-zero direction vector $d \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ such that for an optimal flux distribution $v^\\*$, the new distribution $v = v^\\* + \\alpha d$ (for some scalar $\\alpha \\neq 0$) is also an optimal solution. This requires three conditions on the direction vector $d$:\n$1$. $S d = 0$: The direction vector must lie in the null space of the stoichiometric matrix to maintain the steady-state condition. Such vectors represent balanced cycles or alternative pathways within the network.\n$2$. $c^\\top d = 0$: The direction vector must be orthogonal to the objective vector $c$. This ensures that moving along $d$ does not alter the objective function value.\n$3$. $l \\le v^\\* + \\alpha d \\le u$: The new flux vector must remain within the specified flux bounds.\n\nFlux Variability Analysis (FVA) is a computational method designed to characterize the full range of alternative optimal solutions. For each reaction $j$, FVA determines the minimum and maximum possible flux $v_j$ across the entire set of solutions that achieve the optimal objective value $Z^\\*$. To account for numerical inaccuracies inherent in floating-point arithmetic, it is practical to allow fluxes that achieve an objective value within a small tolerance $\\delta$ of the true optimum $Z^\\*$. As specified, we will constrain the objective flux to the interval $[Z^\\* - \\delta, Z^\\* + \\delta]$.

The fundamental base is the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology (the flow of genetic information from deoxyribonucleic acid to ribonucleic acid to protein), steady-state mass balance for exponential growth, and the enzyme capacity limit stating that reaction flux is proportional to the amount of catalyzing protein. You will use a minimal two-sector proteome model consistent with proteomics and flux analysis, representing a ribosomal sector and a metabolic sector that supplies precursors.\n\nModel definition. Let $p_R$ denote the proteome fraction allocated to ribosomes and $p_M$ denote the proteome fraction allocated to metabolic enzymes. The total allocatable proteome is $P_{\\text{tot}}$, with a minimal metabolic allocation $p_{M,\\min}$ required for viability, so that $p_R \\ge 0$, $p_M \\ge p_{M,\\min}$, and $p_R + p_M \\le P_{\\text{tot}}$.

The state of the system is described by the growth rate $\\mu$ and the proteome fractions allocated to the ribosomal and metabolic sectors, $p_R$ and $p_M$ respectively.\n\nThe optimization problem is stated as:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{maximize} \\quad & \\mu \\\\\n\\text{subject to} \\quad & \\mu \\le k_R \\, p_R \\\\\n& \\mu \\le Y \\, k_M \\, p_M \\\\\n& p_R + p_M \\le P_{\\text{tot}} \\\\\n& p_R \\ge 0 \\\\\n& p_M \\ge p_{M,\\min}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nwhere $k_R$, $k_M$, $Y$, $P_{\\text{tot}}$, and $p_{M,\\min}$ are given positive parameters. The problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and all terms are objectively defined. Therefore, we may proceed with the solution.\n\nTo find the optimal growth rate $\\mu^\\star(P_{\\text{tot}})$, we must identify the active constraints at the optimum. To maximize $\\mu$, resources must be utilized fully. Thus, it is logical to assume the total proteome constraint is active:\n$$\np_R + p_M = P_{\\text{tot}}\n$$\nAny slack in this inequality would mean unused proteome that could be allocated to increase $p_R$ or $p_M$, and consequently $\\mu$.\n\nWe analyze two primary regimes for the optimal solution.\n\n**Regime 1: Balanced Growth**\nThis regime occurs when growth is co-limited by both the ribosomal and metabolic sectors. This implies that the two capacity constraints are simultaneously active at the optimum:\n$$\n\\mu^\\star = k_R \\, p_R^\\star\n$$\n$$\n\\mu^\\star = Y \\, k_M \\, p_M^\\star\n$$\nThis state of \"balanced\" limitation yields a fixed ratio between the optimal proteome allocations:\n$$\nk_R \\, p_R^\\star = Y \\, k_M \\, p_M^\\star \\implies p_R^\\star = \\frac{Y k_M}{k_R} p_M^\\star\n$$\nSubstituting this into the active total proteome constraint $p_R^\\star + p_M^\\star = P_{\\text{tot}}$ allows us to solve for $p_M^\\star$:\n$$\n\\frac{Y k_M}{k_R} p_M^\\star + p_M^\\star = P_{\\text{tot}} \\implies p_M^\\star \\left( 1 + \\frac{Y k_M}{k_R} \\right) = P_{\\text{tot}}\n$$\n$$\np_M^\\star = \\frac{P_{\\text{tot}}}{1 + \\frac{Y k_M}{k_R}} = \\frac{k_R P_{\\text{tot}}}{k_R + Y k_M}\n$$\nThe corresponding ribosomal allocation is:\n$$\np_R^\\star = P_{\\text{tot}} - p_M^\\star = P_{\\text{tot}} \\left(1 - \\frac{k_R}{k_R + Y k_M}\\right) = \\frac{Y k_M P_{\\text{tot}}}{k_R + Y k_M}\n$$\nThe optimal growth rate in this regime is then:\n$$\n\\mu^\\star(P_{\\text{tot}}) = Y k_M p_M^\\star = \\frac{Y k_R k_M P_{\\text{tot}}}{k_R + Y k_M} = \\frac{P_{\\text{tot}}}{\\frac{1}{Y k_M} + \\frac{1}{k_R}}\n$$\nThis solution is valid only if all other constraints are met. The constraint $p_R^\\star \\ge 0$ is always satisfied for positive parameters. However, the constraint $p_M^\\star \\ge p_{M,\\min}$ must be explicitly checked. This holds if:\n$$\n\\frac{k_R P_{\\text{tot}}}{k_R + Y k_M} \\ge p_{M,\\min} \\iff P_{\\text{tot}} \\ge p_{M,\\min} \\left( \\frac{k_R + Y k_M}{k_R} \\right) = p_{M,\\min} \\left( 1 + \\frac{Y k_M}{k_R} \\right)\n$$\nLet us define the critical proteome budget $P_{\\text{tot, crit}} = p_{M,\\min} \\left( 1 + \\frac{Y k_M}{k_R} \\right)$. The balanced growth solution is valid for $P_{\\text{tot}} \\ge P_{\\text{tot, crit}}$.\n\n**Regime 2: Unbalanced, Resource-Limited Growth**\nThis regime occurs when $P_{\\text{tot}} < P_{\\text{tot, crit}}$. In this case, the allocation required for balanced growth would violate the minimal metabolic proteome constraint ($p_M^\\star < p_{M,\\min}$). The optimization is therefore constrained by $p_M \\ge p_{M,\\min}$. To maximize growth, we must allocate the minimum required fraction to metabolism, $p_M^\\star = p_{M,\\min}$, and dedicate all remaining proteome to ribosomes to maximize translational capacity. Again, we assume $p_R^\\star + p_M^\\star = P_{\\text{tot}}$, so:\n$$\np_R^\\star = P_{\\text{tot}} - p_{M,\\min}\n$$\nThis allocation is feasible provided $P_{\\text{tot}} \\ge p_{M,\\min}$, a condition met by all test cases.\nThe growth rate is now limited by the minimum of the two capacities:\n$$\n\\mu^\\star \\le k_R p_R^\\star = k_R (P_{\\text{tot}} - p_{M,\\min})\n$$\n$$\n\\mu^\\star \\le Y k_M p_M^\\star = Y k_M p_{M,\\min}\n$$\nThe condition $P_{\\text{tot}} < P_{\\text{tot, crit}}$ is equivalent to $k_R (P_{\\text{tot}} - p_{M,\\min}) < Y k_M p_{M,\\min}$. Therefore, the ribosomal sector is the bottleneck, and the optimal growth rate is:\n$$\n\\mu^\\star(P_{\\text{tot}}) = k_R (P_{\\text{tot}} - p_{M,\\min})\n$$\nThis is the ribosome-limited regime. Also note that if $P_{\\text{tot}} < p_{M,\\min}$, no feasible solution exists, and the growth rate is effectively zero.\n\n**Summary of the Optimal Growth Rate Function**\nThe optimal growth rate $\\mu^\\star(P_{\\text{tot}})$ is a continuous, piecewise-linear, and concave function of $P_{\\text{tot}}$ for $P_{\\text{tot}} \\ge p_{M,\\min}$:\n$$\n\\mu^\\star(P_{\\text{tot}}) = \\begin{cases}\nk_R (P_{\\text{tot}} - p_{M,\\min}) & \\text{if } p_{M,\\min} \\le P_{\\text{tot}} < P_{\\text{tot, crit}} \\\\\n\\frac{Y k_R k_M P_{\\text{tot}}}{k_R + Y k_M} & \\text{if } P_{\\text{tot}} \\ge P_{\\text{tot, crit}}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $P_{\\text{tot, crit}} = p_{M,\\min} \\left( 1 + \\frac{Y k_M}{k_R} \\right)$.\n\n**Calculation of the Shadow Price**\nThe shadow price $\\lambda(P_{\\text{tot}})$ is defined as the right-sided derivative of the optimal value function with respect to the resource:\n$$\n\\lambda(P_{\\text{tot}}) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\frac{\\mu^\\star(P_{\\text{tot}}+\\epsilon) - \\mu^\\star(P_{\\text{tot}})}{\\epsilon} = \\frac{d^+\\mu^\\star}{dP_{\\text{tot}}}\n$$\nBy differentiating the piecewise expression for $\\mu^\\star(P_{\\text{tot}})$, we obtain the analytical form of the shadow price:\n$$\n\\lambda(P_{\\text{tot}}) = \\begin{cases}\nk_R & \\text{if } p_{M,\\min} \\le P_{\\text{tot}} < P_{\\text{tot, crit}} \\\\\n\\frac{Y k_R k_M}{k_R + Y k_M} & \\text{if } P_{\\text{tot}} \\ge P_{\\text{tot, crit}}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nAt the transition point $P_{\\text{tot}} = P_{\\text{tot, crit}}$, the left derivative is $k_R$ and the right derivative is $\\frac{Y k_R k_M}{k_R + Y k_M}$. The problem specification correctly requests the right-sided derivative, which corresponds to the value in the balanced growth regime.\n\nThe numerical computation will use a finite difference with a small perturbation $\\epsilon = 10^{-9}$:\n$$\n\\lambda(P_{\\text{tot}}) \\approx \\frac{\\mu^\\star(P_{\\text{tot}}+\\epsilon) - \\mu^\\star(P_{\\text{tot}})}{\\epsilon}\n$$\nThis procedure requires a function to compute $\\mu^\\star(P_{\\text{tot}})$ for any given set of parameters. This function will implement the logic derived above, correctly identifying the growth regime based on a comparison of $P_{\\text{tot}}$ with $P_{\\text{tot, crit}}$.
