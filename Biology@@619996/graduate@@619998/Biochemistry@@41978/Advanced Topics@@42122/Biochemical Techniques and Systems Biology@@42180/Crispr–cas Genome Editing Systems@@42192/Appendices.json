It relies on established principles of molecular biology and probability theory, provides all necessary data, and contains no internal contradictions or ambiguities. It is therefore a valid problem.\n\nThe objective is to determine the expected fraction of protospacer start positions that are targetable. A position is defined as targetable if it is adjacent to a valid Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) on either the same strand (downstream) or the opposite strand (which corresponds to an upstream PAM on the reference strand). The problem assumes the reference is the $+$ strand.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the given information. The base composition of the single strand is given by the probabilities:\n$p_A = 0.29$\n$p_T = 0.29$\n$p_G = 0.21$\n$p_C = 0.21$\n\nThe sum of these probabilities is $p_A + p_T + p_G + p_C = 0.29 + 0.29 + 0.21 + 0.21 = 1.00$, as expected.\nThe probabilities for degenerate bases are defined as:\n$p_R = p_A + p_G = 0.29 + 0.21 = 0.50$ (for a purine, A or G)\n$p_Y = p_C + p_T = 0.21 + 0.29 = 0.50$ (for a pyrimidine, C or T)\n$p_N = p_A + p_C + p_G + p_T = 1.00$ (for any base)\n\nThe problem states that nucleotides are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Therefore, the probability of a specific sequence of length $L$ is the product of the probabilities of the nucleotides at each of the $L$ positions.\n\nThere are two scenarios for a protospacer starting at a given position on the $+$ strand to be targetable:\n\n1.  A downstream PAM on the $+$ strand matches the sequence \"NNGRRT\".\n2.  An upstream PAM on the $+$ strand matches the reverse complement of \"NNGRRT\".\n\nLet $P_{down}$ be the probability of a match for the downstream PAM \"NNGRRT\" at any given 6-nucleotide site.\n$$P_{down} = P(\\text{\"NNGRRT\"}) = p_N \\cdot p_N \\cdot p_G \\cdot p_R \\cdot p_R \\cdot p_T$$\nSubstituting the given probabilities:\n$$P_{down} = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot p_G \\cdot (p_R)^2 \\cdot p_T = p_G (p_R)^2 p_T$$\n\nNow, we must find the reverse complement of \"NNGRRT\".\nThe motif is: $5^{\\prime}$-NNGRRT-$3^{\\prime}$\nThe complementary sequence is found by applying Watson-Crick pairing rules (A↔T, G↔C). The complement of a purine $R=\\{A,G\\}$ is a pyrimidine $Y=\\{T,C\\}$.\nComplement: $3^{\\prime}$-NNCYYA-$5^{\\prime}$\nThe reverse complement is obtained by reversing this sequence: $5^{\\prime}$-AYYCNN-$3^{\\prime}$.\n\nLet $P_{up}$ be the probability of a match for this upstream PAM \"AYYCNN\" at any given 6-nucleotide site.\n$$P_{up} = P(\\text{\"AYYCNN\"}) = p_A \\cdot p_Y \\cdot p_Y \\cdot p_C \\cdot p_N \\cdot p_N$$\nSubstituting the given probabilities:\n$$P_{up} = p_A \\cdot (p_Y)^2 \\cdot p_C \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = p_A (p_Y)^2 p_C$$\n\nNow we can compute the numerical values for $P_{down}$ and $P_{up}$.\n$$P_{down} = (0.21) \\cdot (0.50)^2 \\cdot (0.29) = 0.21 \\cdot 0.25 \\cdot 0.29 = 0.015225$$\n$$P_{up} = (0.29) \\cdot (0.50)^2 \\cdot (0.21) = 0.29 \\cdot 0.25 \\cdot 0.21 = 0.015225$$\nNote that $P_{down} = P_{up}$. This is a direct consequence of the given base composition where $p_A = p_T$ and $p_G = p_C$, which implies $p_R = p_Y$.\n\nA site is targetable if the downstream PAM is present OR the upstream PAM is present. Let $E_{down}$ be the event of a valid downstream PAM and $E_{up}$ be the event of a valid upstream PAM. The problem states these events are statistically independent. The probability of a site being targetable, $P_{targetable}$, is the probability of the union of these two events, $P(E_{down} \\cup E_{up})$.\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion for independent events:\n$$P_{targetable} = P(E_{down}) + P(E_{up}) - P(E_{down} \\cap E_{up})$$\nBecause the events are independent, $P(E_{down} \\cap E_{up}) = P(E_{down}) \\cdot P(E_{up})$.\n$$P_{targetable} = P_{down} + P_{up} - P_{down} \\cdot P_{up}$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated probabilities:\n$$P_{targetable} = 0.015225 + 0.015225 - (0.015225) \\cdot (0.015225)$$\n$$P_{targetable} = 2 \\cdot (0.015225) - (0.015225)^2$$\n$$P_{targetable} = 0.03045 - 0.000231795625$$\n$$P_{targetable} = 0.030218204375$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

The problem is scientifically grounded in the established principles of DNA topology and biochemistry. The concepts of linking number, supercoiling, superhelical density, and the nuclease activity of CRISPR-Cas9 are fundamental to molecular biology. All provided numerical values—plasmid length ($L$), superhelical density ($\\sigma$), and helical repeat ($h$)—are physically and biologically realistic for a plasmid isolated from *Escherichia coli*. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing all necessary parameters for a unique solution without internal contradictions or ambiguities. Thus, the problem is declared valid, and a formal derivation of the solution will proceed.\n\nThe topological state of a cccDNA molecule is described by the fundamental relationship involving the linking number ($Lk$), twist ($Tw$), and writhe ($Wr$):\n$$Lk = Tw + Wr$$\nThe linking number, $Lk$, is an integer for a cccDNA molecule and is a topological invariant, meaning it cannot change unless one or both strands of the DNA backbone are broken and rejoined.\n\nA key reference state is the relaxed, non-supercoiled form of the circular DNA. The linking number of this relaxed molecule, denoted $Lk_0$, is defined by the total length of the DNA, $L$, and the number of base pairs per helical turn, $h$.\n$$Lk_0 = \\frac{L}{h}$$\nSubstituting the given values, $L = 8742$ bp and $h = 10.5$ bp/turn:\n$$Lk_0 = \\frac{8742}{10.5} = 832.5714...$$\n\nSupercoiling is the result of a deviation of the actual linking number, $Lk$, from the linking number of the relaxed state, $Lk_0$. This deviation, the linking number difference $\\Delta Lk$, quantifies the number of superhelical turns in the molecule.\n$$\\Delta Lk = Lk - Lk_0$$\nA negative $\\Delta Lk$ corresponds to negative supercoiling, where the DNA is underwound relative to its relaxed state.\n\nThe superhelical density, $\\sigma$, provides a normalized measure of supercoiling, independent of the molecule's length. It is defined as:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{\\Delta Lk}{Lk_0}$$\nThe problem provides $\\sigma = -0.065$. From this definition, we can calculate the total number of superhelical turns, $\\Delta Lk$, present in the initial plasmid.\n$$\\Delta Lk = \\sigma \\times Lk_0$$\nSubstituting the known values into this expression:\n$$\\Delta Lk = -0.065 \\times \\frac{8742}{10.5} \\approx -0.065 \\times 832.5714... \\approx -54.117$$\nThe result, $\\Delta Lk \\approx -54.117$, indicates that the plasmid is negatively supercoiled, containing approximately $54$ effective turns of writhe compared to its relaxed conformation.\n\nThe introduction of a single double-strand break (DSB) by the Cas9 nuclease severs the covalent continuity of the plasmid, converting it from a circular molecule to a single linear molecule with a length of $8742$ bp. A linear DNA molecule is not topologically constrained; its ends are free to rotate, allowing for the complete dissipation of any torsional stress. This process is known as relaxation. Consequently, the writhe ($Wr$) of the molecule becomes zero, and the concept of a fixed, integer linking number is no longer valid. The final state of the DNA is a relaxed, linear molecule with zero superhelical turns.\n\nThe problem asks for the \"number of superhelical turns relieved\". This quantity is the difference between the number of supercoils in the initial state and the final state.\nInitial number of superhelical turns = $\\Delta Lk$.\nFinal number of superhelical turns = $0$.\nNumber of turns relieved = Initial number - Final number = $\\Delta Lk - 0 = \\Delta Lk$. However, \"relieved\" implies a magnitude. A more precise calculation is the change required to go from the initial to the final state:\n$\\text{Change} = \\text{Final state} - \\text{Initial state} = 0 - \\Delta Lk = -\\Delta Lk$.\nThe value $-\\Delta Lk$ represents the number of turns that were present and have now been removed or \"relieved\".\nNumber of turns relieved $= -(\\Delta Lk) = -(-54.117...) = 54.117...$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to the nearest integer.

In the presence of a donor template, double-strand break repair can proceed by homology-directed repair (HDR) or by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which typically yields insertions or deletions (indels). If the donor template does not disrupt the PAM, an HDR-edited allele remains susceptible to re-cutting by Cas9. If the donor carries a PAM-disrupting blocking mutation, re-cutting is strongly reduced.\n\nConsider the following experimentally motivated, minimal stochastic model for a single locus in a single cell during a finite Cas9 activity window.

Upon such a re-cut, a second repair occurs during the same activity window: HDR with probability $h_{2}$, or NHEJ (indel) with probability $1 - h_{2}$.
