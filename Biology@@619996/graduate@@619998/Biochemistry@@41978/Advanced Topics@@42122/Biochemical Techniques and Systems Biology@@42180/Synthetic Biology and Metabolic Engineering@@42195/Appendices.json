This set forms a convex cone in $\\mathbb{R}^4$.\n\nThe final task is to determine the dimension of this set of feasible steady-state fluxes. The dimension of a convex cone is the dimension of the smallest linear subspace containing it. This is equal to the number of linearly independent vectors that generate the cone. The generating vectors $\\mathbf{b}_1$ and $\\mathbf{b}_2$ are linearly independent, as they form a basis for the $2$-dimensional null space of $S$.\nTherefore, the dimension of the set of feasible steady-state fluxes is $2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "2609236"}, {"introduction": "After mapping the possible behaviors of a network, a key question is to determine its maximum theoretical efficiency.

A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Segregation Probability $\\sigma(n)$**\nA plasmid-bearing mother cell replicates its $n$ plasmids to $2n$ copies. At division, these $2n$ copies are distributed between two daughter cells. The partitioning of each plasmid copy is an independent event. For a specific daughter cell, the probability of receiving any given plasmid copy is $1/2$. A segregant (plasmid-free) daughter cell is produced if and only if it receives zero copies. This occurs if all $2n$ plasmid copies segregate to the other daughter cell.\n\nLet us consider the two daughter cells, Daughter A and Daughter B.\nThe probability that a single plasmid copy goes to Daughter B is $1/2$.\nSince the $2n$ plasmids partition independently, the probability that all $2n$ copies go to Daughter B is $(1/2)^{2n}$. In this case, Daughter A is plasmid-free.\nSymmetrically, the probability that all $2n$ copies go to Daughter A is $(1/2)^{2n}$. In this case, Daughter B is plasmid-free.\nThese are mutually exclusive events. The problem defines $\\sigma(n)$ as the probability per division that the division yields one plasmid-free daughter. This event corresponds to either of the two outcomes described.\nTherefore, the total probability of a segregational division is the sum of the probabilities of these two outcomes:\n$$ \\sigma(n) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2n} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2n} = 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2n} = 2 \\times 2^{-2n} = 2^{1-2n} $$\n\n**Population Dynamics Equations**\nLet $P(t)$ and $F(t)$ be the concentrations of the plasmid-bearing and plasmid-free populations. The dynamics are governed by growth, washout, and segregation.\nThe rate of change for the plasmid-bearing population, $P$, is determined by its growth, its loss due to washout, and its effective loss due to segregation. The total rate of divisions for the $P$ population is $\\mu_P P$. A fraction $\\sigma(n)$ of these divisions are segregational (P $\\rightarrow$ P + F), where one parent P-cell yields one daughter P-cell and one daughter F-cell. The remaining fraction, $1-\\sigma(n)$, are normal divisions (P $\\rightarrow$ P + P). The net rate of increase of the P population from cell division is thus $[(1-\\sigma(n))\\times 2 + \\sigma(n)\\times 1 - 1]\\mu_P P = (1-\\sigma(n))\\mu_P P$.\nTherefore, the differential equation for $P(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = (1-\\sigma(n))\\mu_P P - D P = (\\mu_P(1-\\sigma(n)) - D) P $$\nThe plasmid-free population, $F$, grows at its own rate $\\mu_F$, is washed out at rate $D$, and gains new members from segregational divisions of P-cells. The rate of production of F-cells from P-cells is $\\sigma(n)\\mu_P P$.\nTherefore, the differential equation for $F(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dF}{dt} = \\mu_F F + \\sigma(n)\\mu_P P - D F = (\\mu_F - D) F + \\sigma(n)\\mu_P P $$\n\n**Differential Equation for the Plasmid-Bearing Fraction $f(t)$**\nThe fraction of plasmid-bearing cells is $f(t) = P(t) / N(t)$, where $N(t) = P(t) + F(t)$ is the total population size.
