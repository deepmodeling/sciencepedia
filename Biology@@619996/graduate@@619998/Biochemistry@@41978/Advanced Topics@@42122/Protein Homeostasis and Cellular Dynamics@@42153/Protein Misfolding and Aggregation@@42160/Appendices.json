Let the steady-state concentrations be $U_{ss}, I_{ss}, N_{ss}, M_{ss}$.\nThe system becomes:\n1. $0 = s - (k_1 + k_c) U_{ss} + k_{-1} I_{ss}$\n2. $0 = k_1 U_{ss} - (k_{-1} + k_2 + k_m + k_c) I_{ss} + k_{-2} N_{ss}$\n3. $0 = k_2 I_{ss} - (k_{-2} + k_c) N_{ss}$\n4. $0 = k_m I_{ss} - k_c M_{ss}$\n\nThe fraction of misfolded protein is defined as $f_M = \\frac{M_{ss}}{U_{ss} + I_{ss} + N_{ss} + M_{ss}}$.\nWe can express all steady-state concentrations as ratios relative to $I_{ss}$.\nFrom equation (3):\n$N_{ss} = \\frac{k_2}{k_{-2} + k_c} I_{ss}$\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$M_{ss} = \\frac{k_m}{k_c} I_{ss}$\n\nFrom equation (2), we can solve for the ratio $U_{ss} / I_{ss}$:\n$k_1 U_{ss} = (k_{-1} + k_2 + k_m + k_c) I_{ss} - k_{-2} N_{ss}$\nSubstituting the expression for $N_{ss}$:\n$k_1 U_{ss} = (k_{-1} + k_2 + k_m + k_c) I_{ss} - k_{-2} \\left(\\frac{k_2}{k_{-2} + k_c}\\right) I_{ss}$\nDividing by $I_{ss}$ and rearranging:\n$k_1 \\frac{U_{ss}}{I_{ss}} = (k_{-1} + k_m + k_c) + k_2 \\left(1 - \\frac{k_{-2}}{k_{-2} + k_c}\\right)$\n$k_1 \\frac{U_{ss}}{I_{ss}} = k_{-1} + k_m + k_c + \\frac{k_2 k_c}{k_{-2} + k_c}$\nThus,\n$\\frac{U_{ss}}{I_{ss}} = \\frac{1}{k_1} \\left( k_{-1} + k_m + k_c + \\frac{k_2 k_c}{k_{-2} + k_c} \\right)$\n\nThe fraction $f_M$ can be written in terms of these ratios by dividing the numerator and denominator by $I_{ss}$:\n$f_M = \\frac{M_{ss}/I_{ss}}{(U_{ss}/I_{ss}) + 1 + (N_{ss}/I_{ss}) + (M_{ss}/I_{ss})}$\nSubstituting the expressions for the ratios gives $f_M$ as a function of the rate constants. The source rate $s$ does not appear in the final expression for the fraction, as expected.\n$f_M = \\frac{\\frac{k_m}{k_c}}{ \\frac{1}{k_1} \\left( k_{-1} + k_m + k_c + \\frac{k_2 k_c}{k_{-2} + k_c} \\right) + 1 + \\frac{k_2}{k_{-2} + k_c} + \\frac{k_m}{k_c} }$\n\n**Part 3: Derivation of the Threshold $k_m^{\\ast}$**\nThe threshold $k_m^{\\ast}$ is defined by the condition $f_M = \\frac{1}{2}$. Setting the expression for $f_M$ to $\\frac{1}{2}$ and replacing $k_m$ with $k_m^{\\ast}$:\n$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{M_{ss}/I_{ss}}{(U_{ss}/I_{ss}) + 1 + (N_{ss}/I_{ss}) + (M_{ss}/I_{ss})}$\nThis implies:\n$2 \\left(\\frac{M_{ss}}{I_{ss}}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{U_{ss}}{I_{ss}}\\right) + 1 + \\left(\\frac{N_{ss}}{I_{ss}}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{M_{ss}}{I_{ss}}\\right)$\n$\\frac{M_{ss}}{I_{ss}} = \\frac{U_{ss}}{I_{ss}} + \\frac{N_{ss}}{I_{ss}} + 1$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for the ratios, with $k_m = k_m^{\\ast}$:\n$\\frac{k_m^{\\ast}}{k_c} = \\frac{1}{k_1} \\left( k_{-1} + k_m^{\\ast} + k_c + \\frac{k_2 k_c}{k_{-2} + k_c} \\right) + \\frac{k_2}{k_{-2} + k_c} + 1$\nWe must solve this linear equation for $k_m^{\\ast}$. Group terms containing $k_m^{\\ast}$ on one side:\n$k_m^{\\ast} \\left(\\frac{1}{k_c} - \\frac{1}{k_1}\\right) = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_c}{k_1} + \\frac{k_2 k_c}{k_1(k_{-2} + k_c)} + \\frac{k_2}{k_{-2} + k_c} + 1$\nSimplify the left side:\n$k_m^{\\ast} \\left(\\frac{k_1 - k_c}{k_1 k_c}\\right) = \\dots$\nThe problem states $k_1 > k_c$, so the term $(k_1 - k_c)$ is positive and non-zero.\nSimplify the right side by finding a common denominator $k_1(k_{-2} + k_c)$:\nRHS = $\\frac{(k_{-1} + k_c)(k_{-2} + k_c)}{k_1(k_{-2} + k_c)} + \\frac{k_2 k_c}{k_1(k_{-2} + k_c)} + \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_1(k_{-2} + k_c)} + \\frac{k_1(k_{-2} + k_c)}{k_1(k_{-2} + k_c)}$\nRHS = $\\frac{(k_1 + k_{-1} + k_c)(k_{-2} + k_c) + k_2(k_c+k_1)}{k_1(k_{-2} + k_c)}$\nNow we solve for $k_m^{\\ast}$:\n$k_m^{\\ast} = \\left(\\frac{k_1 k_c}{k_1 - k_c}\\right) \\left[ \\frac{(k_1 + k_{-1} + k_c)(k_{-2} + k_c) + k_2(k_1 + k_c)}{k_1(k_{-2} + k_c)} \\right]$\nCanceling the $k_1$ term, we arrive at the final expression for the threshold:\n$k_m^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_c}{k_1 - k_c} \\left[ \\frac{(k_1 + k_{-1} + k_c)(k_{-2} + k_c) + k_2(k_1 + k_c)}{k_{-2} + k_c} \\right]$\nThis expression is in terms of the specified rate constants only.
