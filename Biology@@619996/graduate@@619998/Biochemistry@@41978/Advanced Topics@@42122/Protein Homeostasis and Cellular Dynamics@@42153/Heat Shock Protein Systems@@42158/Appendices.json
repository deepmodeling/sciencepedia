Consider a minimal coarse-grained kinetic representation in which the chaperone exists in two nucleotide-defined states: an ATP-bound state $T$ and an ADP-bound state $D$. The transition $T \\to D$ corresponds to ATP hydrolysis and is stimulated by J-domain protein (JDP), while the effective transition $D \\to T$ corresponds to nucleotide exchange followed by rapid ATP binding and is catalyzed by nucleotide exchange factor (NEF).

It is a straightforward application of fundamental principles of chemical kinetics. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe system is a two-state continuous-time Markov process involving states $T$ (ATP-bound) and $D$ (ADP-bound). The transitions are:\n$$ T \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{h}}} D $$\n$$ D \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{ex}}} T $$\nLet $[T](t)$ and $[D](t)$ be the concentrations of the chaperone in the respective states at time $t$. The total concentration of the chaperone is constant:\n$$ [T](t) + [D](t) = [H]_{\\mathrm{tot}} $$\nAccording to the law of mass action for first-order reactions, the rate of change of the concentrations can be described by a system of ordinary differential equations:\n$$ \\frac{d[D]}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{h}}[T] - k_{\\mathrm{ex}}[D] $$\n$$ \\frac{d[T]}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{ex}}[D] - k_{\\mathrm{h}}[T] $$\nNotice that $\\frac{d[T]}{dt} + \\frac{d[D]}{dt} = 0$, which is consistent with the conservation of total chaperone concentration.\n\nThe problem asks for the steady-state rate. At steady state, the concentrations of all species are constant, which means their time derivatives are zero. Let $[T]_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ and $[D]_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ denote the steady-state concentrations.\n$$ \\frac{d[D]}{dt} = 0 \\implies k_{\\mathrm{h}}[T]_{\\mathrm{ss}} - k_{\\mathrm{ex}}[D]_{\\mathrm{ss}} = 0 $$\nThis gives the central relationship for the steady state:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{h}}[T]_{\\mathrm{ss}} = k_{\\mathrm{ex}}[D]_{\\mathrm{ss}} $$\nThis equation expresses the principle of detailed balance for this simple cycle: at steady state, the gross flux in the forward direction equals the gross flux in the reverse direction.\n\nTo find the individual steady-state concentrations, we solve the system of two linear algebraic equations:\n1. $k_{\\mathrm{h}}[T]_{\\mathrm{ss}} = k_{\\mathrm{ex}}[D]_{\\mathrm{ss}}$\n2. $[T]_{\\mathrm{ss}} + [D]_{\\mathrm{ss}} = [H]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$\n\nFrom equation (2), we express $[T]_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ as $[T]_{\\mathrm{ss}} = [H]_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [D]_{\\mathrm{ss}}$. Substituting this into equation (1):\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{h}}([H]_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [D]_{\\mathrm{ss}}) = k_{\\mathrm{ex}}[D]_{\\mathrm{ss}} $$\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{h}}[H]_{\\mathrm{tot}} - k_{\\mathrm{h}}[D]_{\\mathrm{ss}} = k_{\\mathrm{ex}}[D]_{\\mathrm{ss}} $$\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{h}}[H]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = (k_{\\mathrm{h}} + k_{\\mathrm{ex}})[D]_{\\mathrm{ss}} $$\nSolving for $[D]_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$ [D]_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{h}}}{k_{\\mathrm{h}} + k_{\\mathrm{ex}}} [H]_{\\mathrm{tot}} $$\nWe can then find $[T]_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$ [T]_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{ex}}}{k_{\\mathrm{h}} + k_{\\mathrm{ex}}} [H]_{\\mathrm{tot}} $$\n\nThe volumetric ATP hydrolysis rate, $v$, is defined as the number concentration of ATP molecules hydrolyzed per unit time. Each $T \\to D$ transition event corresponds to one hydrolysis. Therefore, the steady-state rate $v$ is the steady-state flux through this reaction step:\n$$ v = k_{\\mathrm{h}}[T]_{\\mathrm{ss}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $[T]_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$ v = k_{\\mathrm{h}} \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{ex}}}{k_{\\mathrm{h}} + k_{\\mathrm{ex}}} [H]_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\right) $$\nThis simplifies to the required analytical expression for the steady-state velocity:\n$$ v = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{h}} k_{\\mathrm{ex}}}{k_{\\mathrm{h}} + k_{\\mathrm{ex}}} [H]_{\\mathrm{tot}} $$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we must calculate the numerical value of $v$. First, we compute the pseudo-first-order rate constants $k_{\\mathrm{h}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ using the given parameters.\nThe given concentrations are $[J] = 0.50~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $[N] = 0.20~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\nThe rate constant for hydrolysis is:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{h}} = k_{\\mathrm{h}}^{0} + k_{J}\\,[J] = 0.010~\\mathrm{s}^{-1} + (0.100~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1})(0.50~\\mu\\mathrm{M}) $$\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{h}} = 0.010~\\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 0.050~\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 0.060~\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThe rate constant for nucleotide exchange is:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{ex}} = k_{\\mathrm{ex}}^{0} + k_{N}\\,[N] = 0.005~\\mathrm{s}^{-1} + (0.200~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1})(0.20~\\mu\\mathrm{M}) $$\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{ex}} = 0.005~\\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 0.040~\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 0.045~\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nNow we substitute these values, along with $[H]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 2.00~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, into the expression for $v$:\n$$ v = \\frac{(0.060~\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(0.045~\\mathrm{s}^{-1})}{0.060~\\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 0.045~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} (2.00~\\mu\\mathrm{M}) $$\n$$ v = \\frac{0.0027~\\mathrm{s}^{-2}}{0.105~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} (2.00~\\mu\\mathrm{M}) $$\n$$ v \\approx 0.025714~\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\times 2.00~\\mu\\mathrm{M} $$\n$$ v \\approx 0.051428~\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in units of $\\mathrm{nM}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

For work with molar quantities, we use the universal gas constant $R = N_A k_B$, where $N_A$ is Avogadro's constant. The molar free energy difference, which we will also denote by $\\Delta G$, is related by $\\Delta G_{\\text{molar}} = N_A \\Delta G_{\\text{molecular}}$. The equation then becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{P_{\\text{closed}}}{P_{\\text{open}}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G}{R T}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the desired relation. We can solve for $\\Delta G$:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{\\text{closed}}}{P_{\\text{open}}}\\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta G}{R T} \\implies \\Delta G = -R T \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{\\text{closed}}}{P_{\\text{open}}}\\right)\n$$\nAccording to the problem's assumptions, the ratio of probabilities can be directly taken as the ratio of the classified particle counts, $N_{\\text{closed}}$ and $N_{\\text{open}}$.\n$$\n\\frac{P_{\\text{closed}}}{P_{\\text{open}}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{closed}}}{N_{\\text{open}}}\n$$\nNow, we apply this formula to the two specified conditions.\n\n1.  **Apo condition:**\n    The particle counts are given as $N_{\\text{open, apo}} = 128,000$ and $N_{\\text{closed, apo}} = 32,000$. The ratio is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{N_{\\text{closed, apo}}}{N_{\\text{open, apo}}} = \\frac{32,000}{128,000} = \\frac{1}{4}\n    $$\n    The conformational free energy difference is:\n    $$\n    \\Delta G_{\\text{apo}} = -R T \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = R T \\ln(4)\n    $$\n\n2.  **AMP-PNP (nucleotide) condition:**\n    The particle counts are given as $N_{\\text{open, nuc}} = 40,000$ and $N_{\\text{closed, nuc}} = 120,000$. The ratio is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{N_{\\text{closed, nuc}}}{N_{\\text{open, nuc}}} = \\frac{120,000}{40,000} = 3\n    $$\n    The conformational free energy difference is:\n    $$\n    \\Delta G_{\\text{nuc}} = -R T \\ln(3)\n    $$\n\nFinally, we compute the nucleotide-induced coupling free energy, $\\Delta\\Delta G$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G = \\Delta G_{\\text{nuc}} - \\Delta G_{\\text{apo}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G = (-R T \\ln(3)) - (R T \\ln(4)) = -R T (\\ln(3) + \\ln(4))\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(a) + \\ln(b) = \\ln(ab)$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G = -R T \\ln(3 \\times 4) = -R T \\ln(12)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values to find the final answer.\n$R = 8.314\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$\n$T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G = -(8.314\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}) \\times (298\\ \\mathrm{K}) \\times \\ln(12)\n$$\nFirst, calculate the product $R T$:\n$$\nR T = 8.314 \\times 298\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}} \\approx 2477.572\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}\n$$\nThe natural logarithm of $12$ is:\n$$\n\\ln(12) \\approx 2.4849066\n$$\nNow, compute $\\Delta\\Delta G$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G \\approx - (2477.572\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}) \\times 2.4849066 \\approx -6156.63\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in units of $\\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$.\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G \\approx -6.15663\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G \\approx -6.16\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}\n$$\nThe negative sign of $\\Delta\\Delta G$ indicates that the binding of the nucleotide analog stabilizes the closed state relative to the open state.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-6.16}\n$$", "id": "2569485"}]}
