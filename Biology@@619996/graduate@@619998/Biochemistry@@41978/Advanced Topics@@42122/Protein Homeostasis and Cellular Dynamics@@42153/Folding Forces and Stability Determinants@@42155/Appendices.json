The process occurs at constant pressure.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between Gibbs free energy change, enthalpy change ($\\Delta H$), and entropy change ($\\Delta S$) at a given temperature $T$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta G(T) = \\Delta H(T) - T \\Delta S(T)\n$$\nIn the context of protein unfolding, this is written as:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{unf}}(T) = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{unf}}(T) - T \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{unf}}(T)\n$$\nTo find the explicit dependence on $T$, we must relate $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{unf}}(T)$ and $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{unf}}(T)$ to their values at the reference temperature, $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$.

The hydrophobic effect, which drives nonpolar residues to sequester themselves from water, is the dominant driving force for folding.

In addition to performing the calculation, briefly justify the sign you assign and articulate key physical assumptions that underlie treating the apolar surface contribution as linearly additive with a constant coefficient across buried patches.", "solution": "The problem statement has been subjected to rigorous validation and is found to be valid. It is a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective problem rooted in the fundamental principles of biophysical chemistry. It presents a standard, albeit simplified, model for estimating the hydrophobic contribution to protein stability and provides all necessary parameters for a quantitative solution and conceptual analysis.\n\nWe begin by formalizing the model. The hydrophobic contribution to the standard Gibbs free energy of folding, denoted as $\\Delta G_{\\text{ap}}^{\\circ}$, is assumed to have a linear dependence on the change in the solvent-accessible surface area of apolar (nonpolar) groups, $\\Delta \\text{SASA}_{\\text{ap}}$. The mathematical expression for this relationship is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{ap}}^{\\circ} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ap}} \\times \\Delta \\text{SASA}_{\\mathrm{ap}} $$\nwhere $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ap}}$ is the empirical apolar surface tension coefficient, which quantifies the free energy penalty per unit area for exposing apolar surfaces to the aqueous solvent.\n\nThe problem provides the following givens:\nThe apolar surface area that becomes buried upon folding is $800\\,\\text{Å}^2$. Burial of surface area signifies a transfer from a solvent-exposed state (in the unfolded protein) to a non-exposed state (in the folded protein). Therefore, the change in apolar SASA, defined as $\\Delta \\text{SASA}_{\\mathrm{ap}} = \\text{SASA}_{\\mathrm{ap, folded}} - \\text{SASA}_{\\mathrm{ap, unfolded}}$, is negative.\n$$ \\Delta \\text{SASA}_{\\mathrm{ap}} = -800\\,\\text{Å}^2 $$\nThe empirical coefficient is given as:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ap}} = 0.03\\,\\text{kcal}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{Å}^{-2} $$\nThe positive sign of $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ap}}$ is physically correct, as it reflects the thermodynamic penalty associated with creating an interface between an apolar surface and water.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the model equation, we can calculate the hydrophobic stabilization free energy:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{ap}}^{\\circ} = (0.03\\,\\text{kcal}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{Å}^{-2}) \\times (-800\\,\\text{Å}^2) $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{ap}}^{\\circ} = -24\\,\\text{kcal}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to 2 significant figures. The calculated value, $-24$, already has two significant figures, so no further rounding is necessary.\n\nNext, we address the justification of the sign of $\\Delta G_{\\text{ap}}^{\\circ}$. The sign is negative, which, by the stated convention, signifies a stabilization of the folded state. This is the expected result for the hydrophobic effect. The physical origin of this stabilization is primarily entropic. When an apolar surface is exposed to water, the water molecules in the immediate vicinity are forced to adopt a highly ordered, cage-like structure (clathrate-like) to maximize hydrogen bonding with each other, as they cannot form such bonds with the apolar surface. This ordering represents a significant decrease in the entropy of the solvent. Upon folding, these apolar groups are buried in the protein core, releasing the ordered water molecules into the bulk solvent. This release leads to a large increase in the solvent's entropy, which is the dominant favorable term in the Gibbs free energy change for this process ($\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S$). Thus, the burial of apolar surfaces is a spontaneous process driven by the increase in solvent entropy, resulting in a negative $\\Delta G_{\\text{ap}}^{\\circ}$.\n\nFinally, we must articulate the key physical assumptions underlying this linear surface area model.\n$1$. **Linearity and Additivity**: The model assumes that the free energy contribution of burying an apolar surface is strictly proportional to its area. This implies that every square ångström of buried apolar surface contributes an identical amount to $\\Delta G_{\\text{ap}}^{\\circ}$, regardless of the specific chemical nature of the apolar group (e.g., an aliphatic methyl group versus an aromatic phenyl group) or the local geometry and curvature of the protein surface. It also assumes additivity, meaning the total effect is simply the sum of individual atomic or group contributions, ignoring any cooperative or anticooperative interactions between adjacent hydrophobic patches. Realistically, these effects are not perfectly linear or additive.\n$2$. **Constant Coefficient ($\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ap}}$)**: The coefficient $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ap}}$ is treated as a universal constant. In reality, the magnitude of the hydrophobic effect is strongly dependent on temperature, pressure, and the composition of the solvent (e.g., pH and ionic strength). The provided value of $0.03\\,\\text{kcal}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{Å}^{-2}$ is an empirical parameter averaged from experimental data, typically measured at or near ambient conditions ($T \\approx 298$ K). Its application at other conditions without correction is a significant approximation.\n$3$. **Separability of Forces**: The model intrinsically assumes that the hydrophobic contribution to the total folding free energy can be cleanly separated and calculated independently from other forces. The total stability of a protein arises from a delicate balance of several large, opposing forces: the large, unfavorable loss of conformational entropy of the polypeptide chain upon folding, and various stabilizing interactions including hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, electrostatic interactions (salt bridges), and the hydrophobic effect. Assuming these contributions are simply additive is a major simplification, as they are often coupled. For instance, the formation of a stable hydrophobic core dictates the geometry that permits the formation of internal hydrogen bonds.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-24} $$", "id": "2565623"}, {"introduction": "Protein stability rarely arises from a simple sum of independent forces; rather, it emerges from a network of cooperative interactions.
