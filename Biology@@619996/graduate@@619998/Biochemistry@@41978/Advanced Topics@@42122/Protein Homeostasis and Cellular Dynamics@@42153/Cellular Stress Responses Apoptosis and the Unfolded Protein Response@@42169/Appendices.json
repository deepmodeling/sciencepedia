It outlines a standard biochemical model of translational regulation via eIF2 phosphorylation and provides all necessary parameters and definitions for a unique, computable solution. We shall therefore proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe objective is to compute the relative reduction in the protein synthesis rate, $R$. The synthesis rate is proportional to the guanine nucleotide exchange flux, $J$, catalyzed by the enzyme ${\\rm eIF2B}$. The reduction $R$ is defined as:\n$$R = 1 - \\frac{J(f_P)}{J(0)}$$\nwhere $J(f_P)$ is the flux when a fraction $f_P$ of the total ${\\rm eIF2}$ is phosphorylated, and $J(0)$ is the baseline flux where no ${\\rm eIF2}$ is phosphorylated (i.e., $f_P = 0$).\n\nThe flux $J$ follows Michaelis–Menten kinetics with respect to the concentration of its substrate, the unphosphorylated form of ${\\rm eIF2}$, which we denote as $[{\\rm eIF2}_{\\rm U}]$:\n$$J = V_{\\max}\\,\\frac{[{\\rm eIF2}_{\\rm U}]}{K_M + [{\\rm eIF2}_{\\rm U}]}$$\nThe problem provides the following parameters: the Michaelis constant $K_M = 0.5\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$, the total ${\\rm eIF2}$ concentration $[{\\rm eIF2}]_{\\rm tot} = 2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$, and the fraction of phosphorylated ${\\rm eIF2}$, $f_P = 0.6$. The maximum velocity, $V_{\\max}$, is a constant.\n\nFirst, we establish the baseline flux, $J(0)$. At baseline, $f_P = 0$, meaning the entire ${\\rm eIF2}$ pool is in its unphosphorylated, active state. Thus, the substrate concentration for the reaction is the total ${\\rm eIF2}$ concentration:\n$$[{\\rm eIF2}_{\\rm U}]_{\\text{baseline}} = [{\\rm eIF2}]_{\\rm tot}$$\nSubstituting this into the Michaelis–Menten equation yields the expression for the baseline flux:\n$$J(0) = V_{\\max}\\,\\frac{[{\\rm eIF2}]_{\\rm tot}}{K_M + [{\\rm eIF2}]_{\\rm tot}}$$\n\nNext, we determine the flux under cellular stress, $J(f_P)$, where a fraction $f_P = 0.6$ of the total ${\\rm eIF2}$ is phosphorylated. Since phosphorylated ${\\rm eIF2}$ is an inert substrate, only the remaining unphosphorylated fraction contributes to the reaction. The concentration of the active substrate is therefore:\n$$[{\\rm eIF2}_{\\rm U}]_{\\text{stress}} = (1 - f_P) \\cdot [{\\rm eIF2}]_{\\rm tot}$$\nThe corresponding flux is:\n$$J(f_P) = V_{\\max}\\,\\frac{(1 - f_P) \\cdot [{\\rm eIF2}]_{\\rm tot}}{K_M + (1 - f_P) \\cdot [{\\rm eIF2}]_{\\rm tot}}$$\n\nWe can now form the ratio $\\frac{J(f_P)}{J(0)}$.
