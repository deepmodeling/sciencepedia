Additionally, a chaperonin system (for example, GroEL/GroES) driven by Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) transiently encapsulates the unfolded client, where aggregation is fully suppressed and folding may proceed at a (potentially different) rate before release. Model the system as a continuous-time Markov process with the following states: solution-exposed unfolded state $S$, chaperonin-encapsulated state $C$, and two absorbing states, native $N$ and aggregated $A$. The allowed transitions and first-order rate constants are:\n- From $S$: $S \\to N$ with rate $k_{f}$, $S \\to A$ with rate $k_{a}$, $S \\to C$ with rate $k_{\\mathrm{cap}}$.\n- From $C$: $C \\to N$ with rate $k_{f}^{C}$, $C \\to S$ with rate $k_{\\mathrm{rel}}$.\n\nAssume that aggregation does not occur inside the chaperonin ($C$), that release from $C$ returns the client to the same solution-exposed unfolded state $S$ (no memory), and that all waiting times are exponentially distributed (first-order kinetics).

It is scientifically grounded, employing a standard kinetic model for protein folding well-established in biochemistry. It is well-posed, asking for a standard quantity (absorption probability) in a defined Markov process, for which a unique solution exists. All terms are defined, and the data are self-contained and consistent. The problem is formalizable and directly relevant to the topic of folding catalysts. No flaws are identified. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nWe proceed to the solution. The problem is to find the probability of absorption into state $N$ before state $A$. Let $p_i$ be the probability of eventual absorption into state $N$ (folding), given the process starts in state $i$. We are looking for $p_S$. The states are $i \\in \\{S, C\\}$. For the absorbing states, the probabilities are defined by their nature: $p_N = 1$ and $p_A = 0$.\n\nWe can establish a system of linear equations for the unknown probabilities $p_S$ and $p_C$ using the law of total probability, conditioned on the first transition out of a given state. This is a standard first-step analysis for a continuous-time Markov chain.\n\nFor a state $i$ with possible transitions to states $j$ with rates $k_{ij}$, the probability of the next transition being to a specific state $m$ is given by $k_{im} / \\sum_j k_{ij}$. The absorption probability $p_i$ is the sum of these transition probabilities multiplied by the subsequent absorption probabilities from the destination states.\n\nFrom state $S$, the process can transition to $N$, $A$, or $C$. The total rate of exit from $S$ is $k_{\\mathrm{out},S} = k_f + k_a + k_{\\mathrm{cap}}$. The absorption probability $p_S$ is:\n$$p_S = \\frac{k_f}{k_f + k_a + k_{\\mathrm{cap}}} p_N + \\frac{k_a}{k_f + k_a + k_{\\mathrm{cap}}} p_A + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cap}}}{k_f + k_a + k_{\\mathrm{cap}}} p_C$$\nSubstituting $p_N=1$ and $p_A=0$, we obtain the first equation:\n$$p_S = \\frac{k_f + k_{\\mathrm{cap}} p_C}{k_f + k_a + k_{\\mathrm{cap}}}$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$(k_f + k_a + k_{\\mathrm{cap}}) p_S = k_f + k_{\\mathrm{cap}} p_C \\quad (1)$$\n\nFrom state $C$, the process can transition to $N$ or $S$. The total rate of exit from $C$ is $k_{\\mathrm{out},C} = k_f^C + k_{\\mathrm{rel}}$.
