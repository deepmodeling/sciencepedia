If the chemical step governed by $k_{2}$ is unperturbed, then $k_{\\text{cat}} = k_{2}$ will remain essentially unchanged. Therefore, a binding-specific mutation should cause a substantial change in $K_M$ with minimal change in $k_{\\text{cat}}$.\n\n- If a mutation primarily affects the chemical conversion within the bound complex (for example, removing a general acid/base or a transition-state stabilizing interaction that is not present or is weak in the ground state), it will change $k_{2}$ and thus $k_{\\text{cat}}$. If the ground-state $ES$ complex remains similarly stabilized (that is, $k_{1}$ and $k_{-1}$ are largely unchanged), $K_M$ will change little. Therefore, a catalysis-specific mutation should cause a substantial change in $k_{\\text{cat}}$ with minimal change in $K_M$.\n\n- Mutations to residues that interact strongly in both the ground state and the transition state (for instance, a charged residue that hydrogen bonds to the substrate carbonyl both before and during the chemical step) are expected to perturb both $k_{1}$/$k_{-1}$ and $k_{2}$, thereby changing both $K_M$ and $k_{\\text{cat}}$ to varying extents, which complicates the clean assignment of binding versus catalysis.\n\nThe structural roles provided are consistent with these expectations: the hydrophobic-pocket tryptophan primarily recognizes the proline ring (ground-state binding determinant), the histidine is positioned for general acid/base participation in the chemical isomerization (catalytic determinant that need not contribute strongly to ground-state binding), and the arginine engages the substrate carbonyl oxygen in both the ground state and the transition state (likely to influence both binding and catalysis).\n\nWe now evaluate each option in light of these principles.\n\nOption A: $\\mathrm{W}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{F}$ for binding, $\\mathrm{H}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{N}$ for catalysis, with predicted signatures.\n- $\\mathrm{W}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{F}$ is a conservative aromatic-to-aromatic change that reduces hydrophobic surface and removes the indole nitrogen, weakening the hydrophobic pocket without abolishing the geometry; this is expected to weaken $ES$ formation (changing $k_{1}$ and $k_{-1}$), thus increasing $K_M$, while leaving the chemical step $k_{2}$ (and thus $k_{\\text{cat}}$) relatively unchanged. A $5$â€“$10$-fold increase in $K_M$ with $\\leq$ $2$-fold change in $k_{\\text{cat}}$ is a plausible, clean binding signature.\n- $\\mathrm{H}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{N}$ conservatively removes the titratable imidazole while preserving size and hydrogen-bonding capacity in a neutral form, which should attenuate general acid/base catalysis in the chemical step (decreasing $k_{2}$ and thus $k_{\\text{cat}}$), while having limited effect on ground-state $ES$ stability if histidineâ€™s principal role is catalytic. A $\\geq$ $20$-fold decrease in $k_{\\text{cat}}$ with $\\leq$ $2$-fold change in $K_M$ is a strong catalysis-specific signature.

The drastic truncation from tryptophan to alanine removes most hydrophobic contact area and packing, very likely weakening $ES$ affinity substantially (increasing $K_M$). It can also alter the active-site geometry, potentially affecting both $k_{\\text{cat}}$ and $K_M$. Predicting a $>$$50$-fold drop in $k_{\\text{cat}}$ with no change in $K_M$ is not mechanistically aligned with a binding-pocket residue.\n- Assigning $\\mathrm{H}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{N}$ as a binding probe with a $>$$10$-fold increase in $K_M$ and no change in $k_{\\text{cat}}$ is also inconsistent with histidineâ€™s catalytic positioning. Removing the titratable imidazole should primarily impair the chemical step, decreasing $k_{\\text{cat}}$, not leave it unchanged.\n\nVerdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption C: $\\mathrm{R}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{K}$ for catalysis and $\\mathrm{W}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{F}$ for binding, with the stated signatures.\n- $\\mathrm{W}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{F}$ as a binding probe with a modest $2$â€“$3$-fold increase in $K_M$ and minimal change in $k_{\\text{cat}}$ is plausible and aligns with a binding role. However, the other half of the design is problematic.\n- The arginine engages the substrate carbonyl oxygen in both the $ES$ ground state and the transition state. Mutating $\\mathrm{R}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{K}$ retains positive charge but alters geometry and hydrogen-bonding capacity. Because this interaction stabilizes both $ES$ and the transition state, changes are expected in both $K_M$ and $k_{\\text{cat}}$. Predicting a $3$â€“$5$-fold decrease only in $k_{\\text{cat}}$ with $\\leq$ $2$-fold change in $K_M$ presumes negligible effect on ground-state binding, which contradicts the stated structural role. Thus the design does not cleanly isolate catalysis.\n\nVerdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption D: $\\mathrm{H}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{W}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{Y}$ without a priori predictions.\n- This design does not leverage first-principles expectations to separate binding from catalysis. $\\mathrm{H}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{A}$ is a nonconservative mutation likely to perturb both catalysis and local structure, and $\\mathrm{W}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{Y}$ changes both hydrophobic packing and introduces a phenolic hydroxyl that can form new hydrogen bonds; either mutation could affect both $K_M$ and $k_{\\text{cat}}$.
