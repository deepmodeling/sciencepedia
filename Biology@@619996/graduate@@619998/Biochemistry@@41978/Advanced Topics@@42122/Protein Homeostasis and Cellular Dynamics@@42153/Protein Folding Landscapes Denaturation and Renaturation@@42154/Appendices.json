The provided data are physically realistic for protein stability measurements. All necessary information is present, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is a standard exercise in applying the state function properties of Gibbs free energy.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n\n**Solution**\nThe problem requires the calculation of the interaction free energy, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{int}}$, between two mutational sites, $A$ and $B$, in a protein. This quantity measures the degree to which the energetic effects of the two mutations are non-additive. The foundation for this calculation is the principle that the Gibbs free energy, $G$, is a state function. Consequently, the change in Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta G$, depends only on the initial and final states, not on the path taken. This allows for the construction of a thermodynamic cycle.\n\nThe system involves four protein species: wild type (WT), mutant $A$, mutant $B$, and the double mutant $AB$. Each can exist in an unfolded ($U$) or native (folded, $N$) state. The problem provides the Gibbs free energy of folding for each species, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}} = G_{N} - G_{U}$.\n\nThe interaction energy is defined as the deviation from simple additivity.

The problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe framework for this problem is the thermodynamics of a two-state folding reaction, $D \\rightleftharpoons N$, which proceeds through a high-energy transition state ensemble, $TSE$. We define the Gibbs free energy of the denatured, transition, and native states for both the wild-type ($wt$) and mutant ($mut$) proteins as $G_{D}$, $G_{TSE}$, and $G_{N}$, respectively.\n\nThe equilibrium folding free energy is the difference in free energy between the native and denatured states:\n$$ \\Delta G = G_N - G_D $$\nThe activation free energy for the folding reaction ($D \\to N$) is the difference in free energy between the transition state and the denatured state:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\ddagger} = G_{TSE} - G_D $$\nThe problem provides the change in these quantities upon mutation. Let us express these changes in terms of the state free energies. The change in the equilibrium folding free energy, $\\Delta\\Delta G$, is:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G = \\Delta G_{\\text{mut}} - \\Delta G_{\\text{wt}} = (G_{N, \\text{mut}} - G_{D, \\text{mut}}) - (G_{N, \\text{wt}} - G_{D, \\text{wt}}) $$\nRearranging this expression gives:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G = (G_{N, \\text{mut}} - G_{N, \\text{wt}}) - (G_{D, \\text{mut}} - G_{D, \\text{wt}}) $$\nLet $\\delta G_X = G_{X, \\text{mut}} - G_{X, \\text{wt}}$ represent the perturbation of the free energy of state $X$ due to the mutation. Then:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G = \\delta G_N - \\delta G_D $$\nSimilarly, the change in the folding activation free energy, $\\Delta\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, is:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} = \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{mut}} - \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{wt}} = (G_{TSE, \\text{mut}} - G_{D, \\text{mut}}) - (G_{TSE, \\text{wt}} - G_{D, \\text{wt}}) $$\nRearranging gives:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} = (G_{TSE, \\text{mut}} - G_{TSE, \\text{wt}}) - (G_{D, \\text{mut}} - G_{D, \\text{wt}}) $$\nIn terms of the perturbation energies:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} = \\delta G_{TSE} - \\delta G_D $$\nThe theoretical basis of $\\phi$-value analysis is a linear free energy relationship. A central assumption is that the mutation is localized and perturbs a specific contact that exists in the native state but is absent in the largely unstructured denatured state ensemble. Therefore, the effect of the mutation on the free energy of the denatured state is negligible. We set the denatured state as the reference, such that its perturbation is zero:\n$$ \\delta G_D = G_{D, \\text{mut}} - G_{D, \\text{wt}} \\approx 0 $$\nApplying this assumption to our expressions for $\\Delta\\Delta G$ and $\\Delta\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G \\approx \\delta G_N $$\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} \\approx \\delta G_{TSE} $$\nThis shows that $\\Delta\\Delta G$ measures the energetic consequence of the mutation on the stability of the native state, while $\\Delta\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ measures its effect on the stability of the transition state (both relative to the denatured state).\n\nThe $\\phi$-value is defined as a measure of the degree to which the structure around the mutated residue in the transition state resembles the structure in the native state. It is quantified as the ratio of the mutation's energetic effect on the TSE to its effect on the native state:\n$$ \\phi \\equiv \\frac{\\delta G_{TSE}}{\\delta G_N} $$\nSubstituting the expressions derived from the experimental observables, we obtain the expression for the $\\phi$-value:\n$$ \\phi = \\frac{\\Delta\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{\\Delta\\Delta G} $$\nThis is the required derivation. Now, we evaluate this expression using the provided data: $\\Delta\\Delta G = 1.5\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$ and $\\Delta\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} = 0.9\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$.\n$$ \\phi = \\frac{0.9}{1.5} = \\frac{9}{15} = \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Therefore, the numerical value is $0.600$.\n\nFinally, we infer the meaning of this result. The $\\phi$-value acts as a \"structural reporter,\" with values typically ranging from $0$ to $1$. A value of $\\phi=0$ indicates that the environment of the mutated residue in the TSE is identical to that in the denatured state (the native contact is unformed). A value of $\\phi=1$ indicates that the environment in the TSE is identical to that in the native state (the native contact is fully formed). Our calculated value of $\\phi = 0.600$ is an intermediate value. This implies that the specific native contact perturbed by the mutation is partially formed in the folding transition state. The extent of this formation is significant; the energetic stabilization provided by this contact in the TSE is approximately $60\\%$ of its total stabilization energy in the fully folded native state. This suggests that the region of the protein containing the mutated residue has acquired a substantial degree of native-like structure in the transition state but has not yet reached its final, native conformation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.600}$$", "id": "2591499"}, {"introduction": "A fundamental question in protein science is whether folding occurs in a simple, two-state transition or proceeds through one or more stable intermediate states.

The ratio $\\rho = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{cal}}/\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vH}}$ compares the model-independent calorimetric enthalpy with the model-dependent van't Hoff enthalpy, which is derived from the shape of the transition curve. A simple, two-state unfolding transition (Native $\\rightleftharpoons$ Denatured) is characterized by $\\rho = 1$. Our calculated value is $\\rho \\approx 1.45$, which is significantly greater than $1$. This indicates that the unfolding process is not a simple two-state transition.\n\nThe observation $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{cal}} \\gt \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vH}}$ is a classic signature of a multi-state transition involving one or more thermodynamically populated intermediate states (e.g., N $\\rightleftharpoons$ I $\\rightleftharpoons$ D). In such a mechanism, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{cal}}$ measures the total enthalpy difference between the final denatured state and the initial native state. The van't Hoff enthalpy, which depends on the steepness of the transition, reflects the cooperativity of the observed unfolding event. A multi-step process results in a broader transition curve compared to a two-state process with the same total enthalpy, leading to a smaller calculated $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vH}}$. The explicitly provided structure of the excess heat capacity as a sum of two broad, overlapping peaks is direct evidence for a complex, non-two-state mechanism and is consistent with the presence of an intermediate.\n\nIn contrast, if aggregation of the denatured state were to occur, this would typically be an exothermic process. An exothermic contribution would decrease the net measured enthalpy, leading to $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{cal}} \\lt \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{unfolding, true}}$. This would likely result in $\\rho \\lt 1$. Furthermore, the problem states the van't Hoff enthalpy was determined from a \"fully reversible\" experiment, which argues against aggregation under those conditions. Therefore, the result $\\rho \\gt 1$ and the asymmetric, composite peak shape strongly support a mechanism with populated intermediates.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.45}$$", "id": "2591487"}]}
