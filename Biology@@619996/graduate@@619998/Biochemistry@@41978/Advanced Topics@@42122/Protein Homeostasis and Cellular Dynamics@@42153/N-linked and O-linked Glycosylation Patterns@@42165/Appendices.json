This exercise [@problem_id:2580123] challenges you to devise a robust experimental strategy for a complex sample, prompting you to leverage your knowledge of enzyme specificities and chemical release methods to effectively separate and prepare both glycan types for analysis.", "problem": "A researcher is designing a glycomics workflow to profile both N-linked and O-linked glycans by mass spectrometry (MS). The sample is a mixture of a mammalian serum glycoprotein and a recombinant protein expressed in insect cells. Prior literature and lectin binding indicate that the insect-derived protein carries core $\\alpha 1\\text{-}3$-fucosylated N-glycans, whereas the mammalian glycoprotein carries complex N-glycans without core $\\alpha 1\\text{-}3$ fucose. The mammalian glycoprotein is also known to be mucin-type O-glycosylated on serine and threonine residues. The lab has access to Peptide: N-Glycosidase F (PNGase F), Peptide: N-Glycosidase A (PNGase A), neuraminidase, and reagents for alkaline reductive $\\beta$-elimination.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions about glycan linkages and enzyme specificity, reason which combination of release strategies and justifications is most appropriate. In your reasoning, you must start from the chemical nature of the N-glycosidic amide linkage to asparagine versus the O-glycosidic linkage to serine/threonine, and the principle that enzymes recognize specific linkages and steric environments. You must also justify when chemical $\\beta$-elimination is necessary for O-glycans and identify key base-catalyzed side reactions that should be controlled and how.\n\nWhich option best matches the correct specificities and an appropriately controlled workflow?\n\nA. Use PNGase F on denatured protein to release all mammalian N-glycans; for the insect protein, use PNGase A on proteolytically generated glycopeptides to release core $\\alpha 1\\text{-}3$-fucosylated N-glycans that PNGase F cannot cleave.

A mammalian serum glycoprotein.\n    2.  A recombinant protein expressed in insect cells.\n- **Glycosylation Details**:\n    -   Insect protein: Possesses core $\\alpha 1\\text{-}3$-fucosylated N-glycans.\n    -   Mammalian glycoprotein: Possesses complex N-glycans *lacking* core $\\alpha 1\\text{-}3$ fucose.

It presents a realistic scenario in glycomics involving distinct glycan structures from different expression systems (mammalian vs. insect). The specificities of PNGase F and PNGase A with respect to core $\\alpha 1\\text{-}3$ fucosylation are well-established facts in biochemistry. The principles of N-glycan enzymatic release and O-glycan chemical release via reductive $\\beta$-elimination, including associated side reactions like \"peeling,\" are fundamental concepts in glycobiology.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient information to determine an optimal experimental strategy from a set of choices based on known biochemical principles. A unique, best answer can be reasoned out.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\n\n1.  **Nature of Glycosidic Linkages**:\n    -   **N-glycans**: An N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) monosaccharide is attached to the side-chain amide nitrogen of an asparagine (Asn) residue within a protein. This forms a stable amide bond (`-CO-NH-`).\n    -   **O-glycans (mucin-type)**: An N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) monosaccharide is attached to the side-chain hydroxyl oxygen of a serine (Ser) or threonine (Thr) residue. This forms an O-glycosidic bond, which is essentially an ether linkage.\n\n2.  **Principles of Glycan Release**:\n    -   **N-glycan Release**: The stable amide linkage requires enzymatic cleavage for efficient release under non-destructive conditions. The enzymes PNGase F and PNGase A are amidases that hydrolyze the bond between the innermost GlcNAc and the Asn side chain, converting Asn to aspartic acid in the process. Their activity is dictated by substrate specificity.\n        -   **PNGase F**: The standard enzyme for N-glycan release. It is highly efficient but its activity is sterically hindered and blocked by the presence of a fucose residue linked $\\alpha 1\\text{-}3$ to the core GlcNAc attached to Asn.\n        -   **PNGase A**: An alternative enzyme that is not blocked by core $\\alpha 1\\text{-}3$ fucose. It can therefore release N-glycans that are resistant to PNGase F, such as those commonly found in insects and plants. Its optimal activity is typically in a slightly acidic pH range (e.g., $pH \\approx 5$).\n    -   **O-glycan Release**: The O-glycosidic bond is labile to strong base. A base (e.g., hydroxide ion, $\\mathrm{OH}^-$) can abstract the acidic proton from the $\\alpha$-carbon of the Ser or Thr residue. The resulting carbanion rearranges, leading to the elimination of the glycan as an oxyanion. This process is called **$\\beta$-elimination**. While enzymes exist (e.g., O-Glycosidase), they are not universal and cannot release the full repertoire of complex O-glycans. Therefore, chemical $\\beta$-elimination is the most comprehensive method.\n\n3.  **Control of Side Reactions in $\\beta$-Elimination**:\n    -   The primary side reaction is **\"peeling\"**, a base-catalyzed stepwise degradation of the released glycan starting from its newly exposed reducing end.\n    -   To prevent peeling, a reducing agent, typically sodium borohydride ($\\mathrm{NaBH_4}$), is included in the reaction mixture. It immediately reduces the aldehyde group at the reducing end of the glycan to a stable primary alcohol (an alditol). This process is known as **reductive $\\beta$-elimination**.\n    -   Other base-catalyzed side reactions must also be considered and minimized by using the mildest effective conditions (temperature, base concentration, time). These include:\n        -   Deamidation of Asn and glutamine (Gln) residues.\n        -   Racemization of amino acids.\n        -   Cleavage of the peptide backbone.\n        -   Loss of other base-labile modifications such as O-phosphate or O-sulfate.\n        -   Reduction of disulfide bonds by $\\mathrm{NaBH_4}$.\n\n**Application to the Problem**\n-   The mammalian N-glycans lack core $\\alpha 1\\text{-}3$ fucose and can be released by PNGase F.\n-   The insect N-glycans possess core $\\alpha 1\\text{-}3$ fucose and will resist PNGase F cleavage; they require PNGase A.\n-   The mammalian O-glycans are mucin-type and require a comprehensive release strategy, for which reductive $\\beta$-elimination is the standard and most appropriate method.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Use PNGase F on denatured protein to release all mammalian N-glycans; for the insect protein, use PNGase A on proteolytically generated glycopeptides to release core $\\alpha 1\\text{-}3$-fucosylated N-glycans that PNGase F cannot cleave. For O-glycans, employ alkaline reductive $\\beta$-elimination with $\\mathrm{NaBH_4}$ to suppress “peeling,” minimizing exposure to strong base to limit base-catalyzed deamidation, peptide backbone cleavage, loss of O-phosphate or O-sulfate, and disulfide reduction.**\n-   **N-glycan Strategy**: This is a correct and logical strategy. It correctly identifies that PNGase F works for mammalian glycans and that PNGase A is required for the insect-derived glycans due to core $\\alpha 1\\text{-}3$ fucosylation. Using denatured proteins or glycopeptides are standard methods to improve enzyme accessibility and efficiency.\n-   **O-glycan Strategy**: This is the textbook-correct method for comprehensive O-glycan release. It correctly identifies the use of reductive $\\beta$-elimination with $\\mathrm{NaBH_4}$, correctly states its purpose (to suppress peeling), and accurately lists the major side reactions that must be controlled by minimizing reaction severity.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**. This option describes a scientifically sound, specific, and well-controlled workflow that addresses all aspects of the problem.\n\n**B. Because core $\\alpha 1\\text{-}6$ fucose blocks PNGase F, pretreat all N-glycans with neuraminidase and then use PNGase A on intact proteins; for O-glycans, avoid $\\beta$-elimination by using endo-$\\alpha$-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, which universally releases mucin-type O-glycans without desialylation and without peeling.**\n-   **N-glycan Strategy**: This statement contains a fundamental factual error. PNGase F is blocked by core $\\alpha 1\\text{-}3$ fucose, not core $\\alpha 1\\text{-}6$ fucose (which is common on mammalian N-glycans and does not block the enzyme). The entire premise for the proposed N-glycan workflow is incorrect.\n-   **O-glycan Strategy**: This statement contains another fundamental factual error. Endo-$\\alpha$-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (O-Glycosidase) is *not* universal. Its activity is restricted to simple O-glycan core structures and is often blocked by substitution, such as sialylation. It cannot be used for the global release of all mucin-type O-glycans.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This option is based on multiple, critical scientific inaccuracies regarding enzyme specificities.\n\n**C. To address insect-type N-glycans, first remove core $\\alpha 1\\text{-}3$ fucose with a general $\\alpha$-fucosidase and then apply PNGase F to all samples; for O-glycans, perform nonreductive alkaline $\\beta$-elimination without $\\mathrm{NaBH_4}$ to preserve reducing ends for labeling, because peeling is negligible under typical conditions.**\n-   **N-glycan Strategy**: While theoretically plausible, using a fucosidase is a less direct approach than simply using PNGase A, which is available. Furthermore, the specificity of a \"general\" fucosidase could be problematic, potentially removing other fucose residues.\n-   **O-glycan Strategy**: This statement contains a dangerous oversimplification. Peeling is a significant degradation pathway under alkaline conditions and is *not* negligible. While non-reductive elimination is a valid technique used to prepare glycans for labeling, to claim that peeling is negligible under \"typical\" conditions is incorrect and demonstrates a lack of understanding of the reaction's challenges. Careful control of very mild conditions is required to minimize, but not eliminate, peeling.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The assertion that peeling is negligible is a major scientific flaw.\n\n**D. Use PNGase A at neutral $pH$ on intact proteins to release all N-glycans regardless of fucosylation pattern; O-glycans can also be released enzymatically by PNGase A, making $\\beta$-elimination unnecessary and avoiding base-induced side reactions entirely.**\n-   **N-glycan Strategy**: PNGase A does release both types of N-glycans, but its optimal pH is typically acidic (around $pH \\; 5\\text{-}6$), not neutral. Furthermore, using it on intact proteins can be inefficient. This is an oversimplification.\n-   **O-glycan Strategy**: This statement contains a gross factual error. PNGase A is a Peptide: **N**-Glycosidase. It specifically recognizes and cleaves the N-glycosidic linkage to asparagine. It has absolutely no catalytic activity on O-glycosidic linkages to serine or threonine. This fundamentally confuses the function of two distinct classes of enzymes.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This option demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of enzyme function by claiming PNGase A can release O-glycans.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2580123"}, {"introduction": "Once glycans are released, a primary analytical goal is to determine their composition.

The theoretical $m/z$ of the proposed ion must fall within the allowed mass range, defined by the observed $m/z$ and the instrument's mass accuracy.\n$2$. The glycan composition must be consistent with the structure of an N-linked glycan, meaning it must contain at least two HexNAc residues.\n\nFirst, we calculate the acceptable mass range. The observed $m/z$ is $m_{obs} = 915.3064$. The permissible mass error in Daltons is:\n$$ \\Delta m = \\frac{5}{1,000,000} \\times 915.3064 \\approx 0.004577 \\, \\text{Da} $$\nTherefore, the theoretical mass-to-charge ratio, $m_{theo}$, for any valid assignment must be within the range:\n$$ [m_{obs} - \\Delta m, m_{obs} + \\Delta m] = [915.3064 - 0.004577, 915.3064 + 0.004577] $$\n$$ [915.301823, 915.310977] $$\n\nNow, each option is evaluated against the two conditions.\n\n**Option A: $\\text{Hex}_3\\text{HexNAc}_2$ as $[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{Na}]^+$**\n$1$. **Structural Condition**: The composition is $\\text{Hex}_3\\text{HexNAc}_2$.

Assume typical mammalian complex N-glycans terminate in $\\beta 1\\text{-}4$-galactose on N-acetylglucosamine, with optional core $\\alpha 1\\text{-}6$ fucose, and O-glycans are mainly core $\\mathrm{1}$ (Gal$\\beta 1\\text{-}3$GalNAc$\\alpha\\text{-}$Ser/Thr) with variably sialylated termini. The neutral mass contributions of common monosaccharides are: fucose $146\\,\\mathrm{Da}$, hexose $162\\,\\mathrm{Da}$, N-acetylhexosamine $203\\,\\mathrm{Da}$, and N-acetylneuraminic acid $291\\,\\mathrm{Da}$. The mass-to-charge ratio is denoted $m/z$.\n\nStarting from the following well-tested principles: enzyme specificities as stated above, the definition that PNGase F releases almost all N-glycans from asparagine (converting asparagine to aspartate by deamidation), Endo H cleaves within the chitobiose core of high-mannose and some hybrid but not complex N-glycans, O-glycosidase removes only the unsubstituted core $\\mathrm{1}/\\mathrm{3}$ disaccharide from Ser/Thr and requires prior desialylation, and that sequential exoglycosidase digestion produces predictable mass losses equal to the monosaccharide masses, you must choose the single best experimental strategy that will unambiguously determine the sialic acid linkage types on the N- versus O-glycans and verify an O-glycan core $\\mathrm{1}$, and you must justify the expected LC–MS outcomes at each step in terms of $m/z$ (or neutral mass) shifts.\n\nWhich option is optimal?\n\n- A. First, release N-glycans with PNGase F and analyze the released pool by LC–MS. Treat the released N-glycans with the $\\alpha 2\\text{-}3$-specific sialidase and record $-291\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ per cleaved N-acetylneuraminic acid only from $\\alpha 2\\text{-}3$ termini. Follow with broad sialidase to remove any remaining $\\alpha 2\\text{-}6/\\alpha 2\\text{-}8$ sialic acids, observing additional $-291\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ steps on resistant species. After complete desialylation, apply $\\beta 1\\text{-}4$-galactosidase ($-162\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ per galactose), then $\\beta$-N-acetylhexosaminidase ($-203\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ per N-acetylglucosamine) to sequence antennae, and finally $\\alpha 1\\text{-}6$-fucosidase ($-146\\,\\mathrm{Da}$) to confirm core fucosylation. In parallel, treat the PNGase F–deglycosylated protein with the $\\alpha 2\\text{-}3$-specific sialidase: an $m/z$ (neutral mass) loss of $291\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ increments indicates $\\alpha 2\\text{-}3$-sialylated O-glycans; any residual sialic acids are confirmed by broad sialidase. Only after complete desialylation, apply O-glycosidase to the protein: a $-365\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ loss per site (Gal $162\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ + GalNAc $203\\,\\mathrm{Da}$) confirms core $\\mathrm{1}$ O-glycans; lack of Endo H cleavage on the released N-glycans supports complex-type N-glycans.\n- B. First, release N-glycans with Endo H and determine sialic acid linkage by treating the released pool with $\\alpha 2\\text{-}3$-specific sialidase; any remaining sialic acids after this step must be $\\alpha 2\\text{-}6$, proving the linkage distribution on complex N-glycans. Then, for O-glycans, apply O-glycosidase first to the intact protein, expecting $-365\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ per site even if sialylated, and finally treat with broad sialidase to remove any terminal sialic acids left behind.\n- C. Work on the intact glycoprotein only: apply broad sialidase first to remove all sialic acids from both N- and O-glycans, expecting $-291\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ per sialic acid. Then add $\\alpha 1\\text{-}6$-fucosidase to remove terminal fucose on the antennae ($-146\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ per fucose), followed by $\\beta 1\\text{-}4$-galactosidase to remove all galactose ($-162\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ per residue) and deduce linkage types from the magnitude of each total mass shift. Conclude O-glycan core $\\mathrm{1}$ status if O-glycosidase subsequently produces no mass change.\n- D. First, desialylate the released N-glycans with $\\alpha 2\\text{-}3$-specific sialidase and assign any remaining sialic acids as $\\alpha 2\\text{-}6$. For O-glycans, treat the PNGase F–deglycosylated protein with $\\beta 1\\text{-}4$-galactosidase prior to O-glycosidase; loss of $-162\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ per site followed by no additional change upon O-glycosidase indicates core $\\mathrm{1}$ O-glycans. Confirm complex N-glycans by Endo H digestion, which should remove them if they are biantennary.\n- E. Use only the intact protein: apply $\\alpha 2\\text{-}3$-specific sialidase and measure the $-291\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ steps to count $\\alpha 2\\text{-}3$-linked sialic acids; then apply broad sialidase to count $\\alpha 2\\text{-}6$ by the additional $-291\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ steps. Without releasing glycans, sequence antennae by $\\beta$-N-acetylhexosaminidase ($-203\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ per residue) followed by $\\beta 1\\text{-}4$-galactosidase ($-162\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ per residue), and finally assign O-glycan core $\\mathrm{1}$ if O-glycosidase yields a $-365\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ loss.", "solution": "The problem will first be subjected to rigorous validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n- **Analyte:** A purified mammalian glycoprotein.\n- **Glycosylation:** Carries both N-linked and O-linked glycans.\n- **Objective (i):** To determine if terminal sialic acid linkages on complex N-glycans are $\\alpha 2\\text{-}3$ and/or $\\alpha 2\\text{-}6$.\n- **Objective (ii):** To determine if O-glycans are core $\\mathrm{1}$ sialoglycans with $\\alpha 2\\text{-}3$-linked sialic acid, and to verify the core type via exoglycosidase sequencing.\n- **Available Reagents & Methods:**\n    - Linkage-specific sialidase (cleaves only $\\alpha 2\\text{-}3$-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid).\n    - Broad-specificity sialidase (cleaves $\\alpha 2\\text{-}3/\\alpha 2\\text{-}6/\\alpha 2\\text{-}8$ linkages).\n    - Peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F).\n    - Endo-$\\beta$-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H).\n    - O-glycosidase (endo-$\\alpha$-N-acetylgalactosaminidase).\n    - $\\beta 1\\text{-}4$-galactosidase.\n    - $\\beta$-N-acetylhexosaminidase.\n    - $\\alpha 1\\text{-}6$-fucosidase.\n    - Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (LC–MS).\n- **Assumed Structures:**\n    - N-glycans: Typical mammalian complex type, terminating in $\\beta 1\\text{-}4$-galactose on N-acetylglucosamine, with optional core $\\alpha 1\\text{-}6$ fucose.\n    - O-glycans: Mainly core $\\mathrm{1}$ (Gal$\\beta 1\\text{-}3$GalNAc$\\alpha\\text{-}$Ser/Thr) with variably sialylated termini.\n- **Monosaccharide Neutral Mass Contributions:**\n    - Fucose: $146\\,\\mathrm{Da}$.\n    - Hexose (e.g., Galactose): $162\\,\\mathrm{Da}$.\n    - N-acetylhexosamine (e.g., N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine): $203\\,\\mathrm{Da}$.\n    - N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid): $291\\,\\mathrm{Da}$.\n- **Stated Principles:**\n    1. PNGase F releases almost all N-glycans from asparagine, converting Asn to Asp.\n    2. Endo H cleaves within the chitobiose core of high-mannose and some hybrid N-glycans, but not complex N-glycans.\n    3. O-glycosidase removes only the unsubstituted core $\\mathrm{1}/\\mathrm{3}$ disaccharide from Ser/Thr and requires prior desialylation.\n    4. Sequential exoglycosidase digestion produces predictable mass losses.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly based on established principles of glycobiology and analytical biochemistry. The specified enzyme specificities (PNGase F vs. Endo H, specific vs. broad sialidases, O-glycosidase requiring desialylation) are correct and standard in the field. The assumed glycan structures and monosaccharide masses are also standard.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides two clear objectives and a defined set of tools. It asks for the optimal experimental strategy to achieve these objectives, which is a solvable problem of experimental design. A unique, best answer can be determined by applying the given principles.\n- **Objective:** The problem statement is written in precise, technical language, free of subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem does not violate any criteria for invalidity. It is scientifically sound, formally structured, internally consistent, and requires substantive reasoning based on established biochemical principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. I will now proceed with the solution derivation and option analysis.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe primary challenge is to distinguish between modifications on N-glycans versus O-glycans. A sound strategy must physically or enzymatically separate these two classes of glycans before characterizing them.\n\nThe most effective method for this separation is the use of PNGase F. This enzyme specifically releases N-glycans from the protein backbone, leaving the O-glycans attached. This creates two distinct populations for analysis:\n1.  The released N-glycan pool.\n2.  The remaining glycoprotein, which now contains only O-glycans.\n\n**Analysis of N-glycans (Objective i):**\nThe released N-glycans are analyzed by LC–MS. To determine the sialic acid linkages, a sequential digestion is performed on this pool.\n- **Step 1:** Treatment with the $\\alpha 2\\text{-}3$-specific sialidase will cleave only $\\alpha 2\\text{-}3$-linked sialic acids. A mass decrease of $291\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ per sialic acid removed will be observed by LC-MS for any glycan species possessing this linkage.\n- **Step 2:** Subsequent treatment with the broad-specificity sialidase will remove any remaining sialic acids (i.e., those with $\\alpha 2\\text{-}6$ or $\\alpha 2\\text{-}8$ linkages). An additional mass decrease of $291\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ on previously resistant species indicates the presence of non-$\\alpha 2\\text{-}3$ linkages. This unambiguously addresses objective (i).\n\n**Analysis of O-glycans (Objective ii):**\nThe PNGase F-treated protein, now carrying only O-glycans, is analyzed.\n- **Step 1:** To determine sialylation, this protein is treated with sialidases. The problem asks if O-glycans have $\\alpha 2\\text{-}3$ linkages. Thus, treatment with the $\\alpha 2\\text{-}3$-specific sialidase should be performed. A mass decrease of $291\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ for the protein confirms the presence of $\\alpha 2\\text{-}3$-sialylated O-glycans.\n- **Step 2:** To verify the core $\\mathrm{1}$ structure (Gal$\\beta 1\\text{-}3$GalNAc), O-glycosidase is used. A critical principle is that O-glycosidase requires an *unsubstituted* core. Therefore, all sialic acids must be removed first. This is achieved by treating the protein with the broad-specificity sialidase until no further mass loss is observed.\n- **Step 3:** After complete desialylation, O-glycosidase is applied. If the O-glycan is a core $\\mathrm{1}$ structure, the enzyme will cleave the Gal$\\beta 1\\text{-}3$GalNAc disaccharide, resulting in a mass loss of $162\\,\\mathrm{Da} + 203\\,\\mathrm{Da} = 365\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ from the protein per O-glycan site. This confirms the core $\\mathrm{1}$ structure.\n\nWith this correct strategy established, let us evaluate the options provided.\n\n**Option A:** This option follows the exact logical procedure derived from first principles.\n1.  It correctly proposes to first release N-glycans with PNGase F to separate them from O-glycans.\n2.  It correctly describes the sequential sialidase digestion of the *released N-glycan pool* to determine $\\alpha 2\\text{-}3$ versus other linkages.\n3.  It correctly describes further exoglycosidase sequencing of the N-glycans to confirm structure.\n4.  It correctly proposes to analyze the O-glycans on the *PNGase F–deglycosylated protein*.\n5.  It correctly uses the $\\alpha 2\\text{-}3$-specific sialidase to test for sialylation on O-glycans.\n6.  It correctly states that O-glycosidase must be applied *after complete desialylation* and correctly predicts the mass loss of $365\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ for a core $\\mathrm{1}$ O-glycan.\n7.  The final point about Endo H resistance is a correct and valid confirmation that the N-glycans are of the complex type.\nEvery step is biochemically sound and directly contributes to achieving the stated objectives unambiguously.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B:** This option begins by releasing N-glycans with Endo H. This is a fundamental error. The problem states the N-glycans are \"complex,\" and the provided principles state that Endo H does not cleave complex N-glycans. The experiment would fail at this initial step, as no N-glycans would be released for analysis. Furthermore, it incorrectly suggests O-glycosidase can be used on sialylated glycans, which contradicts the given principle that the substrate must be unsubstituted.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C:** This option proposes to work on the intact glycoprotein without separating N- and O-glycans. This makes it impossible to assign observed mass changes to a specific glycan type. For example, if a sialic acid is removed, one cannot know if it came from an N-glycan or an O-glycan. Objective (i) and (ii) cannot be met. The option also incorrectly describes the action of $\\alpha 1\\text{-}6$-fucosidase as removing \"terminal fucose on the antennae\"; this enzyme cleaves *core* fucose. Finally, it makes the nonsensical claim that a core $\\mathrm{1}$ status is confirmed if O-glycosidase produces *no* mass change; the opposite is true.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D:** This option has multiple flaws. For O-glycan analysis, it suggests treating the PNGase F–deglycosylated protein with $\\beta 1\\text{-}4$-galactosidase. The assumed core $\\mathrm{1}$ O-glycan structure is Gal$\\beta 1\\text{-}3$GalNAc. A $\\beta 1\\text{-}4$-galactosidase cannot cleave a $\\beta 1\\text{-}3$ linkage. This step is useless. Additionally, it ignores that any terminal sialic acid would block the galactosidase from accessing the galactose. The final statement that Endo H digestion would remove complex biantennary glycans is a direct contradiction of the provided principle that Endo H does *not* cleave complex N-glycans.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option E:** This option also proposes to work on the intact protein, which, as explained for option C, makes distinguishing N- and O-glycan modifications impossible. Furthermore, it proposes an incorrect exoglycosidase sequencing order for the antennae: $\\beta$-N-acetylhexosaminidase *before* $\\beta 1\\text{-}4$-galactosidase. On a typical antenna (e.g., ...Gal-GlcNAc-), the galactose is terminal (or capped by sialic acid) and must be removed before the subterminal N-acetylglucosamine can be accessed. Finally, it ignores the critical requirement that O-glycans must be desialylated before O-glycosidase can act. Applying O-glycosidase to a sialylated glycoprotein would likely result in no cleavage.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on this analysis, Option A is the only one that presents a scientifically valid, logical, and complete experimental strategy that fulfills all requirements of the problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2580100"}]}
