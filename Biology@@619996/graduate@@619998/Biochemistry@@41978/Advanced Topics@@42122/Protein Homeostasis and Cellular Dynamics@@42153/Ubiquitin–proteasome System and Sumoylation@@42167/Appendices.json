The fundamental base for your reasoning is as follows: Ubiquitin (Ub) is conjugated to substrates via a cascade of ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3). Polyubiquitin chains are extended by forming isopeptide bonds between the C-terminus of an incoming ubiquitin and the $\\varepsilon$-amino group of a lysine residue on the previously attached ubiquitin. Substituting a lysine with arginine abolishes isopeptide formation at that position because arginine lacks a primary amine. Different linkages encode distinct fates: $K_{48}$- and $K_{11}$-linked chains are classical degradation signals recognized by receptors on the 26S proteasome, while $K_{63}$-linked chains often mediate non-proteolytic signaling. Efficient proteasomal degradation typically requires a chain of at least $4$ ubiquitins in a proteasome-competent linkage. Small-molecule proteasome inhibitors such as MG132 block proteasomal proteolysis but not ubiquitination.\n\nYou set up two parallel in vitro assays with a model misfolded substrate S carrying a chaperone-dependent degron:\n\n- Condition 1 (degradative context): E3 CHIP with E2 UbcH5a, which favors $K_{48}$-linked chain assembly on misfolded clients.\n- Condition 2 (signaling context): E3 TRAF6 with E2 Ubc13/Mms2, which specifically builds $K_{63}$-linked chains.\n\nIn each condition, you provide one ubiquitin variant as the sole source of ubiquitin (E1 and ATP are present). The ubiquitin variants are:\n- Ub-WT (wild-type)\n- Ub-K0 (all 7 lysines converted to arginine)\n- Ub-K48R (lysine 48 converted to arginine)\n- Ub-K48-only (all lysines except K48 converted to arginine)\n- Ub-K63-only (all lysines except K63 converted to arginine)\n\nYou assess three readouts for each reaction: (i) chain formation by anti-Ub immunoblot laddering on substrate S, (ii) linkage identity using $K_{48}$-specific and $K_{63}$-specific antibodies, and (iii) degradation of S after addition of purified 26S proteasomes, with or without MG132.\n\nWhich option best captures the expected outcomes across the two conditions and the panel of ubiquitin variants, given the principles above?\n\nA. Ub-K0 supports proteasomal degradation in both conditions via linear ($M_1$) head-to-tail chains; Ub-K48R has no effect in Condition 1 because mixed-linkage chains suffice; Ub-K63-only supports rapid degradation in Condition 2, which is insensitive to MG132.\n\nB. Ub-WT yields proteasomal degradation in both conditions; Ub-K48-only blocks degradation in Condition 1 due to lack of chain heterogeneity; Ub-K63-only supports degradation in Condition 1 because any polyubiquitin chain of length $\\geq 4$ is proteasome-competent; Ub-K0 gives mono-ubiquitination but degradation proceeds slowly.\n\nC. Ub-WT shows strong $K_{48}$ laddering and MG132-sensitive degradation in Condition 1, and strong $K_{63}$ laddering without degradation in Condition 2; Ub-K0 yields mostly mono-ubiquitination and no degradation in both conditions; Ub-K48R abolishes degradation in Condition 1 and eliminates $K_{48}$ signal, while allowing $K_{63}$ chains in Condition 2 without degradation; Ub-K48-only restores robust degradation in Condition 1 and prevents chain assembly in Condition 2 (Ubc13/Mms2 cannot build $K_{48}$ chains); Ub-K63-only produces $K_{63}$-linked polyubiquitin with poor or no degradation in Condition 1 and robust $K_{63}$ chains without degradation in Condition 2; MG132 specifically blocks degradation where present but does not alter ubiquitin laddering.\n\nD. Ub-WT shows no degradation in Condition 1 because CHIP requires branched $K_{11}$/$K_{48}$ chains that cannot form in vitro; Ub-K48-only and Ub-K63-only both abolish polyubiquitin chain formation because single-lysine-only ubiquitin cannot be activated by E1; Ub-K48R and Ub-K0 both produce short $K_{63}$ chains that efficiently trigger proteasomal degradation in Condition 2.", "solution": "Let's systematically analyze the expected outcomes for each condition and ubiquitin variant based on the established principles.\n\n**In Condition 1 (CHIP/UbcH5a, favors $K_{48}$ chains for degradation):**\n*   **Ub-WT:** Will form predominantly $K_{48}$-linked chains, leading to MG132-sensitive degradation.\n*   **Ub-K0:** Only allows for mono-ubiquitination.

These are not degradation signals. No degradation occurs.\n*   **Ub-K0:** Only mono-ubiquitination is possible. No chains, no degradation.\n*   **Ub-K48R:** The K48R mutation is irrelevant. The enzyme will use the available $K_{63}$ to build chains. No degradation occurs.\n*   **Ub-K48-only:** Lacks the required $K_{63}$ residue. The specific Ubc13/Mms2 complex cannot build chains. Only mono-ubiquitination occurs.\n*   **Ub-K63-only:** Ideal substrate for this condition, leading to robust $K_{63}$ chain synthesis. No degradation occurs.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n*   **A is incorrect:** Ub-K0 cannot form polyubiquitin chains. Ub-K48R would have a major negative effect on degradation in Condition 1.\n*   **B is incorrect:** Ub-WT does not cause degradation in Condition 2. Ub-K48-only promotes, not blocks, degradation in Condition 1.\n*   **C is correct:** This option accurately predicts all outcomes based on our analysis. It correctly describes the results for Ub-WT, Ub-K0, Ub-K48R, Ub-K48-only, and Ub-K63-only in both conditions, and the effect of MG132.\n*   **D is incorrect:** E1 activation at the ubiquitin C-terminus is independent of its internal lysines.
