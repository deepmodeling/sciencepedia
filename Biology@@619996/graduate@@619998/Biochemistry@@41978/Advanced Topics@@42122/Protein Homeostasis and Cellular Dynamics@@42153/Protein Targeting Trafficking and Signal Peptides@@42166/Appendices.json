Its ratio is:\n$$\n\\Gamma_Y \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_Y}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{-1.8\\,k_B T}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp(1.8)\n$$\nNumerically, $\\exp(1.8) \\approx 6.05$.\n\n**Cargo Z:**\nThe free energy difference is $\\Delta G_Z = \\beta\\left[(L_Z - d_r)^2 - (L_Z - d_{nr})^2\\right]$.\nWe substitute the given values: $L_Z = 3.1\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and other parameters as for $Y$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta G_Z}{k_B T} = \\frac{\\beta}{k_B T}\\left[(3.1 - 3.6)^2 - (3.1 - 3.2)^2\\right] = 10\\left[(-0.5)^2 - (-0.1)^2\\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta G_Z}{k_B T} = 10[0.25 - 0.01] = 10(0.24) = 2.4\n$$\nSo, $\\Delta G_Z = 2.4\\,k_B T$.\nFor this cargo, the basolateral capture rate is increased by a factor $s=5$. This introduces a factor of $1/s$ into the apical/basolateral ratio. The ratio is:\n$$\n\\Gamma_Z \\propto \\frac{1}{s}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_Z}{k_B T}\\right) = \\frac{1}{5}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2.4\\,k_B T}{k_B T}\\right) = \\frac{1}{5}\\exp(-2.4)\n$$\nNumerically, $\\exp(-2.4) \\approx 0.0907$, so $\\Gamma_Z \\propto \\frac{1}{5}(0.0907) \\approx 0.0181$.\n\n**Ranking:**\nWe must now compare the relative magnitudes of the ratios:\n$\\Gamma_X \\propto \\exp(4) \\approx 54.6$\n$\\Gamma_Y \\propto \\exp(1.8) \\approx 6.05$\n$\\Gamma_Z \\propto \\frac{1}{5}\\exp(-2.4) \\approx 0.0181$\n\nIt is clear that $54.6 > 6.05 > 0.0181$. Therefore, the ranking of the apical-to-basolateral export ratios from highest to lowest is $\\Gamma_X > \\Gamma_Y > \\Gamma_Z$.\n\nThis result is conceptually sound. Cargo $X$ has a strong intrinsic preference for rafts (apical destination). Cargo $Y$ has a weaker preference for rafts. Cargo $Z$ has a preference for non-rafts (basolateral destination), and this preference is further amplified by a specific basolateral sorting signal.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   **A. $X > Y > Z$**: This ordering matches our derived result. The apical/basolateral sorting ratio is highest for the strong raft-partitioning cargo $X$, intermediate for the weaker raft-partitioning cargo $Y$, and lowest for cargo $Z$, which partitions to non-rafts and has an explicit basolateral sorting signal. **Correct**.\n\n*   **B. $Y > X > Z$**: This is incorrect. Our calculation shows that $\\Gamma_X \\gg \\Gamma_Y$ because $\\exp(4)$ is substantially larger than $\\exp(1.8)$. Cargo $X$'s raft affinity is much stronger than that of Cargo $Y$. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. $X > Z > Y$**: This is incorrect. Our calculation shows that $\\Gamma_Y \\gg \\Gamma_Z$. Cargo $Y$ partitions preferentially to rafts ($\\Delta G_Y < 0$), leading to $\\Gamma_Y \\propto \\exp(1.8) > 1$. Cargo $Z$ partitions to non-rafts ($\\Delta G_Z > 0$) *and* has its basolateral export enhanced, leading to an extremely small ratio $\\Gamma_Z \\propto (1/5)\\exp(-2.4) \\ll 1$. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. $Z > Y > X$**: This is incorrect. It is the reverse of the correct ordering. This would imply that basolateral sorting features promote apical targeting, which is a contradiction of the premises. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2594321"}]}
