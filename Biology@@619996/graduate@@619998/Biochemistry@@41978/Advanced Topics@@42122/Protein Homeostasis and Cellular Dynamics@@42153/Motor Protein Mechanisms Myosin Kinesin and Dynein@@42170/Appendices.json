We begin with the fundamental definition of average velocity for a processive molecular motor.\n\nThe average velocity, $v$, of the kinesin dimer is the product of its characteristic mechanical step size, $d$, and its stepping frequency, $f_{step}$. This relationship is expressed as:\n$$v = d \\cdot f_{step}$$\nThe problem provides the necessary values: the average velocity is $v = 800\\,\\mathrm{nm}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and the step size, corresponding to the axial repeat of tubulin heterodimers along a single protofilament, is $d = 8\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. We are tasked with finding the stepping frequency, $f_{step}$.

The problem statement specifies a condition of tight chemomechanical coupling, where the hydrolysis of one molecule of ATP fuels exactly one forward mechanical step. Furthermore, it is given that contributions from non-productive pathways, such as backward steps or futile hydrolysis cycles (ATP consumption without mechanical work), are negligible. This establishes a strict one-to-one ($1:1$) stoichiometry between the chemical cycle (ATP hydrolysis) and the mechanical cycle (stepping). Consequently, the rate of chemical turnover must be identical to the rate of mechanical stepping.\n$$k_{ATP} = f_{step}$$\nSince we have already determined that $f_{step} = 100\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, it follows logically and directly that the ATP hydrolysis rate is also:\n$$k_{ATP} = 100\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nTherefore, the kinesin hydrolyzes $100$ molecules of ATP per second to maintain its motion.

The concept of a stall force, where the motor's force generation is balanced by an external load, is fundamental to the study of molecular motors. The assumption of a linear (Hookean) restoring force for the optical trap is a valid approximation for small displacements and is standard practice in the analysis of such experiments. The quasistatic assumption at stall is also appropriate, as the net velocity is zero and the system is in mechanical equilibrium.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

It is free of subjectivity, ambiguity, or opinion.\n\nVerdict: The problem is valid. It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective problem in biophysics. A solution can be derived.\n\nStep 3: Solution Derivation.\nThe problem states that at stall, the kinesin motor's average velocity is zero. This condition represents mechanical equilibrium. In this state, the force generated by the kinesin motor is exactly balanced by the external load imposed by the optical trap.\n\nThe optical trap is described as having a linear restoring force. This is governed by Hooke's Law, where the magnitude of the restoring force, $F_{trap}$, is directly proportional to the displacement, $x$, from the equilibrium position (the center of the trap).\n$$\nF_{trap} = k \\cdot x\n$$\nHere, $k$ is the stiffness of the trap.\n\nThe kinesin motor walks along the microtubule, pulling the bead away from the trap center. The force exerted by the motor, $F_{motor}$, acts in opposition to the trap's restoring force. At the point of stall, the motor exerts its maximum possible force, the stall force $F_s$, which is insufficient to produce further net displacement against the load.\n\nAt equilibrium (stall), the magnitude of the force generated by the motor must equal the magnitude of the restoring force from the trap:\n$$\nF_{motor} = F_{trap}\n$$\nAt the specific stall condition, the motor force is the stall force, $F_s$, and the displacement is the stall displacement, $x_{stall}$. Thus, we can write:\n$$\nF_{s} = k \\cdot x_{stall}\n$$\nWe are asked to find the stall displacement, $x_{stall}$.

Consider an engineered mutant in which each head’s neck linker is lengthened by $2$ residues without otherwise altering the microtubule-binding interface or the nucleotide-binding pocket.

The question is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, permitting a unique qualitative solution based on the given principles. It is not trivial and requires a logical chain of reasoning.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed to the derivation of the solution.\n\n**Derivation**\nThe analysis will proceed by sequentially deducing the consequences of the engineered modification based on the provided foundational bases.\n\n1.  **Effect on Intramolecular Strain:**\n    The kinesin dimer steps between binding sites on the microtubule protofilament, which are spaced approximately $d = 8\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ apart. In a two-head-bound state, the neck linkers are stretched to span this distance. According to Principle (i), the neck linker functions as a polymer that generates entropic tension when extended. Principle (ii) dictates that for this fixed separation distance $d$, increasing the contour length of the polymer (by adding $2$ residues to each neck linker) reduces the entropic force (tension) it exerts. Therefore, the mutation directly results in a reduction of the intramolecular strain between the two motor heads when they are both bound to the microtubule.\n\n2.  **Effect on Gating Efficiency:**\n    Gating efficiency is defined as the strength of interhead coordination, which arises from this intramolecular strain. Principle (iii) states that this strain energetically biases the order of nucleotide transitions, ensuring, for example, that the leading head does not bind $\\text{ATP}$ prematurely. Since the strain is reduced in the mutant, the energetic barrier that enforces this coordination is lowered. The chemomechanical cycles of the two heads become less strictly coupled. Consequently, the probability of uncoordinated, unproductive events increases. This directly translates to a **decrease in gating efficiency**.\n\n3.  **Effect on Stepping Fidelity:**\n    Stepping fidelity refers to the preference for forward steps along the protofilament over side-steps or back-steps. A key function of the neck linker strain is to guide the detached, diffusing head (tethered by its neck linker to the stationary, MT-bound head) towards the next binding site, which is $8\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ forward. The tension in the neck linker acts as a \"leash,\" biasing the random thermal motion of the diffusing head in the forward direction. With a longer, more flexible neck linker, the entropic restoring force for a given extension is weaker. This reduced tension provides a less effective directional cue. The search for a new binding site by the detached head becomes more isotropic, increasing the relative probability of binding to a site other than the one directly in front. Therefore, a **decrease in stepping fidelity** is expected.\n\n4.  **Effect on Average Run Length:**\n    Average run length is the mean distance the motor travels before detaching from the track. According to Principle (iv), this property reflects the competition between the rate of successful forward stepping ($k_{\\text{step}}$) and the rate of dissociation ($k_{\\text{off}}$). The average number of steps is proportional to the ratio $k_{\\text{step}} / k_{\\text{off}}$. A motor's processivity is compromised when the probability of detachment per cycle increases.\n    The decreased gating efficiency and stepping fidelity both contribute to an increase in the likelihood of a catastrophic, process-terminating event. For example:\n    - Reduced gating allows the motor to enter non-canonical, weakly-bound states (e.g., with both heads in an adenosine diphosphate, $\\text{ADP}$, state) from which dissociation is more probable.\n    - Reduced stepping fidelity means the diffusing head takes longer to find the correct forward binding site. This increased search time raises the probability that the stationary \"anchor\" head will complete its own cycle and detach from the microtubule before the diffusing head has re-bound, causing the entire dimer to dissociate.\n    Both effects lead to an increase in the overall detachment rate, $k_{\\text{off}}$, relative to the productive stepping rate, $k_{\\text{step}}$. A higher probability of detachment per cycle results in fewer steps being taken, on average, before the motor falls off. Therefore, the average run length **decreases**.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation:**\nThe lengthening of the neck linker by $2$ residues is predicted to cause a decrease in gating efficiency, a decrease in stepping fidelity, and a decrease in average run length.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Gating efficiency decreases; stepping fidelity decreases; run length decreases.**\n    This option matches the derived consequences precisely. The reduction in strain weakens coordination (gating), reduces directional guidance (fidelity), and increases the probability of termination per cycle (run length).\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Gating efficiency increases; stepping fidelity increases; run length increases.**\n    This option states the opposite of what is derived. A reduction in the strain that mediates coordination cannot lead to simultaneous improvements in all three properties.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Gating efficiency decreases; stepping fidelity increases; run length increases.**\n    This option contains internal contradictions. It is not logical for stepping fidelity to increase when the directional force guiding the step is reduced. An increase in run length is also inconsistent with decreased gating efficiency.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Gating efficiency is unchanged; stepping fidelity decreases; run length increases.**\n    This option is incorrect on its first premise. Principle (iii) explicitly links gating to strain, and Principle (ii) links strain to linker length. Thus, gating efficiency must change. The predicted increase in run length is also incorrect.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. Gating efficiency decreases; stepping fidelity decreases; run length increases.**\n    This option correctly identifies the effects on gating and fidelity but incorrectly predicts an increase in run length. An increase in run length would require that the probability of detachment per cycle decreases, which contradicts the consequence of having a less coordinated and less directionally biased motor.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2578981"}]}
