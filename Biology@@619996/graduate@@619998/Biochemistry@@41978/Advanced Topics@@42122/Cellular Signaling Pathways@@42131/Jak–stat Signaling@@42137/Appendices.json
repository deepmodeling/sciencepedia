The Jak-STAT signaling pathway, the role of STAT3, its SH2 domain, and phosphorylated tyrosine motifs are fundamental concepts in cell signaling and immunology. The use of a dissociation constant to quantify binding affinity is a standard principle in physical chemistry and biochemistry.

The language is precise and objective. No scientific, logical, or structural flaws are present.\n\nVerdict: The problem is valid. A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe solution will proceed by using the fundamental definitions of the dissociation constant and fractional occupancy as directed.\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the fraction of total receptor sites that are bound by the ligand. The total concentration of receptor sites, $[\\mathrm{R}]_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the concentrations of free receptor sites, $[\\mathrm{R}]$, and ligand-bound receptor sites, $[\\mathrm{RL}]$.\n$$ [\\mathrm{R}]_{\\text{total}} = [\\mathrm{R}] + [\\mathrm{RL}] $$\nThus, the fractional occupancy is given by:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[\\mathrm{RL}]}{[\\mathrm{R}]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{RL}]}{[\\mathrm{R}] + [\\mathrm{RL}]} $$\nThe dissociation constant, $K_{d}$, for the bimolecular reaction $\\mathrm{R} + \\mathrm{L} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{RL}$ is defined by the mass action law at equilibrium:\n$$ K_{d} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{R}][\\mathrm{L}]}{[\\mathrm{RL}]} $$\nFrom this definition, we can express the concentration of free receptors, $[\\mathrm{R}]$, in terms of the other species:\n$$ [\\mathrm{R}] = \\frac{K_{d} [\\mathrm{RL}]}{[\\mathrm{L}]} $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[\\mathrm{R}]$ into the equation for fractional occupancy $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[\\mathrm{RL}]}{\\left(\\frac{K_{d} [\\mathrm{RL}]}{[\\mathrm{L}]}\\right) + [\\mathrm{RL}]} $$\nThe term $[\\mathrm{RL}]$ is a common factor in the denominator and can also be factored out from the entire denominator. This allows for its cancellation with the numerator:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[\\mathrm{RL}]}{[\\mathrm{RL}] \\left(\\frac{K_{d}}{[\\mathrm{L}]} + 1\\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{d}}{[\\mathrm{L}]} + 1} $$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $[\\mathrm{L}]$ yields the standard form of the binding isotherm for a one-to-one interaction:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[\\mathrm{L}]}{K_{d} + [\\mathrm{L}]} $$\nThis equation relates the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ to the free ligand concentration $[\\mathrm{L}]$ and the dissociation constant $K_{d}$.\n\nThe problem states that the concentration of receptor sites is sparse compared to the total concentration of STAT3 ligand. This is a critical piece of information. It justifies the approximation that the amount of ligand bound to receptors is negligible compared to the total amount of ligand in the system. Therefore, the free ligand concentration at equilibrium, $[\\mathrm{L}]$, is approximately equal to the total ligand concentration, $[\\mathrm{L}]_{\\text{total}}$.\n$$ [\\mathrm{L}] \\approx [\\mathrm{L}]_{\\text{total}} = 500\\,\\text{nM} $$\nWe are given $K_{d} = 50\\,\\text{nM}$.
