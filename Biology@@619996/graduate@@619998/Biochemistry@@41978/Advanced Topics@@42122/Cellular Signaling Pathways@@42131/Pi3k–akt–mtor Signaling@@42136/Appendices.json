This practice [@problem_id:2587253] delves into the mechanism of the oncogenic AKT1 E17K mutation, a change that leads to constitutive pathway activation even without growth factor signals. By integrating concepts of electrostatics, binding equilibria, and the relative abundance of different membrane lipids, you will deduce how this single amino acid substitution rewires Akt's membrane recruitment machinery. This problem highlights the power of biochemical reasoning to connect a specific molecular lesion to its profound cellular consequences.", "problem": "An investigator is studying how the Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain mutation E17K in v-Akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT1) alters membrane recruitment in the absence of growth factors. Consider the following widely accepted biochemical facts as the fundamental base:\n\n- Class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) converts phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). In growth factor–deprived cells, class I PI3K activity is low and PIP3 levels decline, whereas PIP2 remains relatively abundant.\n- Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domains bind specific phosphoinositides, and membrane recruitment occurs when the effective interaction between the PH domain and anionic membrane lipids is sufficiently strong to shift the equilibrium toward the membrane-associated state.\n- Electrostatic attraction between basic residues in lipid-binding pockets and anionic headgroups increases binding affinity; adding a basic side chain can increase affinity and broaden specificity to anionic lipids.\n\nA serum-starvation experiment uses epithelial cells in which the plasma membrane mole fractions are measured as follows: PIP2 is approximately $1\\%$, and PIP3 is approximately $0.02\\%$. Upon stimulation with growth factor, PIP3 rises to approximately $0.3\\%$, while PIP2 remains near $1\\%$. Biophysical measurements show that the wild-type AKT1 PH domain binds PIP3 with dissociation constant $K_d \\approx 0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and has negligible affinity for PIP2 ($K_d \\gg 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$), whereas the AKT1 E17K PH domain binds PIP3 with $K_d \\approx 0.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and additionally binds PIP2 with $K_d \\approx 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. The AKT1 E17K substitution introduces a lysine at position $17$ of the PH domain, adding a positive charge in the lipid-binding pocket. A phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor reduces PIP3 to approximately $0.01\\%$, and a phospholipase C (PLC) agonist reduces PIP2 by approximately $80\\%$ (to approximately $0.2\\%$). 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) are the kinases that phosphorylate AKT1 at threonine $308$ and serine $473$, respectively, in a manner facilitated by membrane proximity.\n\nWhich option best predicts how the AKT1 E17K PH domain mutation alters lipid affinity and produces constitutive membrane localization and signaling in growth factor–deprived cells, including the effects of PI3K inhibition and PLC activation?\n\nA. The E17K mutation broadens specificity to anionic phosphoinositides by increasing electrostatic attraction, conferring substantial affinity for PIP2 in addition to PIP3. In serum-starved cells, AKT1 E17K localizes to the plasma membrane even when PI3K is inhibited (PIP3 very low), due to binding to PIP2. PLC activation, which depletes PIP2, displaces AKT1 E17K from the membrane. Compared with wild type, AKT1 E17K shows elevated basal phosphorylation at threonine $308$ and serine $473$, which drops upon PLC activation.\n\nB. The E17K mutation requires elevated PIP3 and cannot utilize PIP2; therefore, PI3K inhibition abolishes membrane localization of AKT1 E17K in starved cells, and PLC activation has minimal effect. Wild-type AKT1 behaves similarly under these conditions.\n\nC. The E17K mutation retargets AKT1 to bind phosphatidylserine (PS) exclusively, rendering phosphoinositides dispensable. Consequently, PLC activation increases membrane localization by depleting PIP2 and freeing space for PS, while PI3K inhibition has no effect on E17K localization.\n\nD. The E17K mutation decreases affinity for anionic lipids due to steric hindrance in the PH pocket, so AKT1 E17K requires higher PIP3 than wild type for recruitment and shows reduced membrane localization in starved cells.\n\nE. The E17K mutation only increases specificity for PIP3 without affecting PIP2 affinity; therefore, AKT1 E17K exhibits enhanced membrane localization only upon growth factor stimulation and shows no constitutive localization in starved cells or sensitivity to PLC activation.", "solution": "We begin from fundamental principles relevant to lipid-mediated membrane recruitment:\n\n1. Class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). In growth factor–deprived conditions, PI3K activity decreases and PIP3 levels fall, whereas PIP2 remains relatively abundant. Therefore, in starved cells we have PIP2 $\\approx 1\\%$ and PIP3 $\\approx 0.02\\%$; with a PI3K inhibitor, PIP3 drops further to $\\approx 0.01\\%$.\n2. Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domains bind phosphorylated phosphatidylinositols. The membrane-associated fraction increases with increased interaction strength between the PH domain and the lipid headgroup. For a simple binding site, the bound fraction $f$ increases with lipid density $[L]$ and decreases with the dissociation constant $K_d$, following the equilibrium concept that stronger binding (smaller $K_d$) and larger $[L]$ yield larger $f$.\n3. Electrostatics: Introducing a basic side chain (lysine) into a lipid-binding pocket increases favorable electrostatic interactions with anionic headgroups, typically increasing affinity (decreasing $K_d$) and potentially broadening specificity from a highly selective phosphoinositide (such as PIP3) to include other anionic lipids (such as PIP2).\n\nApplying these to AKT1 PH domain binding:\n\n- Wild-type (WT) AKT1 PH has $K_d \\approx 0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ for PIP3 and negligible PIP2 binding ($K_d \\gg 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$). In starved cells where PIP3 $\\approx 0.02\\%$, the effective interaction is weak; thus, WT AKT1 is largely cytosolic without growth factor. When PIP3 rises to $\\approx 0.3\\%$, recruitment occurs.\n- AKT1 E17K PH has $K_d \\approx 0.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ for PIP3 and acquires $K_d \\approx 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ for PIP2. Even though PIP3 is low in starved cells, PIP2 is relatively abundant at $\\approx 1\\%$. The combination of non-negligible PIP2 affinity and high PIP2 density can drive significant membrane association of E17K even when PIP3 is scarce. This follows the equilibrium notion that a modest affinity can suffice when the ligand density is high.\n\nPredicting perturbation effects:\n\n- PI3K inhibitor reduces PIP3 to $\\approx 0.01\\%$. WT AKT1 remains cytosolic. E17K, however, can still bind PIP2 ($K_d \\approx 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) at $\\approx 1\\%$ mole fraction, so membrane localization persists to a substantial degree. Therefore, E17K localization is relatively PI3K-independent compared to WT, although loss of PIP3 may still slightly reduce any PIP3-dependent component.\n- PLC agonist reduces PIP2 by $\\approx 80\\%$ to $\\approx 0.2\\%$. This lowers the available PIP2 density, diminishing E17K’s PIP2-mediated binding and thus displacing E17K from the membrane. WT AKT1, which did not rely on PIP2 in the first place, shows little additional change under PLC activation in the starved state.\n\nConsequences for signaling:\n\n- Phosphorylation of AKT1 at threonine $308$ by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) and at serine $473$ by mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) is facilitated by membrane proximity and colocalization. E17K’s constitutive membrane localization increases the probability of encounters with these kinases even when PIP3 is low, yielding elevated basal phosphorylation compared to WT. Depletion of PIP2 by PLC should reduce E17K’s membrane residency and lower basal phosphorylation. PI3K inhibition may decrease PIP3-dependent colocalization of PDK1, potentially attenuating phosphorylation, but E17K remains higher than WT due to its persistent membrane presence via PIP2.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. States that E17K broadens specificity to anionic phosphoinositides, gaining substantial PIP2 affinity; therefore, in starved and PI3K-inhibited cells E17K still localizes via PIP2, while PLC-mediated PIP2 depletion displaces it. It also predicts elevated basal phosphorylation at threonine $308$ and serine $473$ for E17K, which declines with PLC activation. This matches the electrostatic rationale, the given $K_d$ values, and the lipid abundance changes. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. Claims E17K cannot utilize PIP2 and that PI3K inhibition abolishes E17K localization, with PLC having minimal effect. This contradicts the provided $K_d$ values showing E17K binds PIP2 ($K_d \\approx 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) and the fundamental reasoning that higher PIP2 density can support membrane binding. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. Asserts exclusive retargeting to phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphoinositide dispensability, plus increased localization upon PLC activation. There is no support for exclusive PS binding; the data indicate increased affinity for PIP3 and gained affinity for PIP2. PLC depletes PIP2, which should reduce, not increase, E17K localization. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. Proposes decreased affinity due to steric hindrance and a requirement for higher PIP3 than WT. This is inconsistent with the electrostatic effect of introducing a lysine and the given $K_d$ values (lower $K_d$ for PIP3, new binding to PIP2). Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nE. Suggests E17K only increases specificity for PIP3, with no change in PIP2 affinity, and thus no constitutive localization in starved cells or PLC sensitivity. This contradicts the provided PIP2 $K_d$ and the predicted PIP2-dependent recruitment.
