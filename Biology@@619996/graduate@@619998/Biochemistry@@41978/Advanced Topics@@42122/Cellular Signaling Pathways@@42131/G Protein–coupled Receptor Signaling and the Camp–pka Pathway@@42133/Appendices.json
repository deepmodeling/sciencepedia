No flaws related to scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the fractional occupancy, $f$, as a function of the free ligand concentration, $[L]$, and the dissociation constant, $K_d$. We begin with the provided definitions.\n\nThe total receptor concentration is the sum of free and bound receptors:\n$$R_T = [R] + [RL]$$\nFrom this conservation equation, we can express the concentration of free receptors, $[R]$, as:\n$$[R] = R_T - [RL]$$\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the law of mass action:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\nWe substitute the expression for $[R]$ into the equation for $K_d$:\n$$K_d = \\frac{(R_T - [RL])[L]}{[RL]}$$\nOur goal is to find an expression for the fractional occupancy, $f = \\frac{[RL]}{R_T}$. To achieve this, we must rearrange the equation to solve for this ratio. We multiply both sides by $[RL]$:\n$$K_d [RL] = (R_T - [RL])[L]$$\nDistributing $[L]$ on the right-hand side gives:\n$$K_d [RL] = R_T [L] - [RL][L]$$\nWe collect all terms containing $[RL]$ on one side of the equation:\n$$K_d [RL] + [RL][L] = R_T [L]$$\nFactoring out $[RL]$ from the left-hand side yields:\n$$[RL] (K_d + [L]) = R_T [L]$$\nTo obtain the fractional occupancy, $f = \\frac{[RL]}{R_T}$, we divide both sides by $R_T$ and by $(K_d + [L])$:\n$$f = \\frac{[RL]}{R_T} = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}$$\nThis is the required expression for fractional occupancy, commonly known as the Hill-Langmuir equation for a single, non-cooperative binding site.\n\nNext, we evaluate $f$ for the given parameters. The dissociation constant is $K_d = 10$ nM.\n\nCase 1: The ligand concentration is $[L] = 5$ nM.\nThe fractional occupancy, $f_1$, is:\n$$f_1 = \\frac{5 \\text{ nM}}{10 \\text{ nM} + 5 \\text{ nM}} = \\frac{5}{15} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nCase 2: The ligand concentration is $[L] = 50$ nM.\nThe fractional occupancy, $f_2$, is:\n$$f_2 = \\frac{50 \\text{ nM}}{10 \\text{ nM} + 50 \\text{ nM}} = \\frac{50}{60} = \\frac{5}{6}$$\n\nFinally, we must explain the asymmetry of the response. The relationship $f([L]) = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_d}$ is non-linear. The sensitivity of the fractional occupancy to changes in ligand concentration is given by the first derivative, $\\frac{df}{d[L]}$:\n$$\\frac{df}{d[L]} = \\frac{d}{d[L]} \\left( \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_d} \\right) = \\frac{(1)([L] + K_d) - ([L])(1)}{([L] + K_d)^2} = \\frac{K_d}{([L] + K_d)^2}$$\nThe rate of change of $f$ is not constant but decreases as $[L]$ increases. This diminishing sensitivity is characteristic of saturation phenomena. The curvature of the function $f([L])$ is described by the second derivative:\n$$\\frac{d^2f}{d[L]^2} = \\frac{d}{d[L]} \\left( K_d ([L] + K_d)^{-2} \\right) = -2 K_d ([L] + K_d)^{-3}$$\nSince $[L] \\geq 0$ and $K_d > 0$, the second derivative is always negative. This proves that the function $f([L])$ is strictly concave down. For a concave down function, the change in the function's value for a given step size $\\Delta [L]$ is greater at lower values of $[L]$ than at higher values of $[L]$.\n\nTo demonstrate the asymmetry around $[L] = K_d$, we can compare the change in $f$ resulting from adding a small concentration $\\delta$ to $K_d$ versus subtracting it.\nThe increase in $f$ when going from $[L] = K_d - \\delta$ to $[L] = K_d$ is:\n$$\\Delta f_{\\text{below}} = f(K_d) - f(K_d - \\delta) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{K_d - \\delta}{(K_d - \\delta) + K_d} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{K_d - \\delta}{2K_d - \\delta} = \\frac{(2K_d - \\delta) - 2(K_d - \\delta)}{2(2K_d - \\delta)} = \\frac{\\delta}{2(2K_d - \\delta)}$$\nThe increase in $f$ when going from $[L] = K_d$ to $[L] = K_d + \\delta$ is:\n$$\\Delta f_{\\text{above}} = f(K_d + \\delta) - f(K_d) = \\frac{K_d + \\delta}{(K_d + \\delta) + K_d} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{K_d + \\delta}{2K_d + \\delta} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2(K_d + \\delta) - (2K_d + \\delta)}{2(2K_d + \\delta)} = \\frac{\\delta}{2(2K_d + \\delta)}$$\nSince $\\delta > 0$, the denominator $2(2K_d - \\delta)$ is smaller than $2(2K_d + \\delta)$. Therefore, $\\Delta f_{\\text{below}} > \\Delta f_{\\text{above}}$. This explicitly shows that an additive change in $[L]$ produces a larger change in fractional occupancy below $K_d$ than above it.\n\nThis inherent non-linearity and saturation are fundamental to the sensitivity of the cAMP-PKA pathway. At low ligand concentrations (well below $K_d$), fractional occupancy is nearly proportional to $[L]$, and the system is highly sensitive to the appearance of the ligand. As the ligand concentration approaches and exceeds $K_d$, the receptors begin to saturate. This diminishing return mechanism prevents the signaling pathway from overreacting to large, sustained ligand signals, allowing the cell to remain responsive over a wide dynamic range of stimulus concentrations while protecting it from maximal, potentially cytotoxic, stimulation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{5}{6} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2566048"}, {"introduction": "While equilibrium describes the final state of a system, the speed at which that state is reached is governed by kinetics.

At chemical equilibrium, the net rate of formation of the receptor-ligand complex, $[RL]$, is zero. This occurs when the rate of association equals the rate of dissociation.\nThe rate of association is $k_{\\text{on}}[R]_{eq}[L]_{eq}$.\nThe rate of dissociation is $k_{\\text{off}}[RL]_{eq}$.\nSetting these equal yields the equilibrium condition:\n$$k_{\\text{on}}[R]_{eq}[L]_{eq} = k_{\\text{off}}[RL]_{eq}$$\nRearranging this equation gives the ratio of the rate constants:\n$$\\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}} = \\frac{[R]_{eq}[L]_{eq}}{[RL]_{eq}}$$\nThe problem defines the dissociation constant as $K_d \\equiv \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$ at equilibrium.

Thus, the concentration of free receptor is $[R] = [R]_T - [RL]$. We are also given that the ligand concentration is constant at $[L]_0$, as ligand depletion is negligible. Substituting these into the rate equation:\n$$\\frac{d[RL]}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}}([R]_T - [RL])[L]_0 - k_{\\text{off}}[RL]$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We rearrange it to group terms involving $[RL]$:\n$$\\frac{d[RL]}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}}[R]_T[L]_0 - (k_{\\text{on}}[L]_0 + k_{\\text{off}})[RL]$$\nLet us define an observed rate constant, $k_{\\text{obs}}$, as:\n$$k_{\\text{obs}} = k_{\\text{on}}[L]_0 + k_{\\text{off}}$$\nThe differential equation simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{d[RL]}{dt} = k_{\\text{on}}[R]_T[L]_0 - k_{\\text{obs}}[RL]$$\nAt equilibrium ($t \\to \\infty$), $\\frac{d[RL]}{dt} = 0$.
