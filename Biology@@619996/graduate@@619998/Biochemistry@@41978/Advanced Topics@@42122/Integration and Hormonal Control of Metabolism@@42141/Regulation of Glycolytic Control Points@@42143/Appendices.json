For this two-enzyme system, this is expressed as:\n$$C_{1}^{J} + C_{2}^{J} = 1$$\n\nSecond, the Connectivity Theorem relates the control coefficients to the elasticity coefficients ($\\varepsilon_{i}^{X}$). Elasticities describe the local sensitivity of an enzyme's reaction rate to changes in the concentration of a metabolite $X$. The theorem states that for any internal metabolite $X$, the sum over all enzymes of the product of their flux control coefficient and their elasticity with respect to $X$ is zero.

Substituting this into $(3)$:\n$$\n\\alpha\\,x^{\\ast}\\,\\frac{J - k_{x}\\,x^{\\ast}}{k_{y}} = k_{y} \\implies \\alpha = \\frac{k_{y}^{2}}{x^{\\ast}(J - k_{x}\\,x^{\\ast})}\n$$\nNow we find an expression for the term $\\alpha\\,(y^{\\ast})^{2}$ that is independent of $y^{\\ast}$ and $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha\\,(y^{\\ast})^{2} = \\left( \\frac{k_{y}^{2}}{x^{\\ast}(J - k_{x}\\,x^{\\ast})} \\right) \\left( \\frac{J - k_{x}\\,x^{\\ast}}{k_{y}} \\right)^{2} = \\frac{J - k_{x}\\,x^{\\ast}}{x^{\\ast}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expressions for the trace and determinant:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{J}^{\\ast}) = k_{y} - k_{x} - \\left(\\frac{J - k_{x}\\,x^{\\ast}}{x^{\\ast}}\\right) = k_{y} - k_{x} - \\frac{J}{x^{\\ast}} + k_{x} = k_{y} - \\frac{J}{x^{\\ast}}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Det}(\\mathbf{J}^{\\ast}) = k_{y}\\left(\\alpha\\,(y^{\\ast})^{2}\\right) - k_{x}\\,k_{y} = k_{y}\\left(\\frac{J - k_{x}\\,x^{\\ast}}{x^{\\ast}}\\right) - k_{x}\\,k_{y} = \\frac{k_{y}(J - k_{x}\\,x^{\\ast}) - k_{y}\\,k_{x}\\,x^{\\ast}}{x^{\\ast}} = \\frac{k_{y}\\,J - 2\\,k_{x}\\,k_{y}\\,x^{\\ast}}{x^{\\ast}} = k_{y}\\frac{J - 2\\,k_{x}\\,x^{\\ast}}{x^{\\ast}}\n$$\n\nFourth, we determine the critical activation level $\\alpha_{c}$ for the Hopf bifurcation. A Hopf bifurcation occurs when $\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{J}^{\\ast}) = 0$ and $\\mathrm{Det}(\\mathbf{J}^{\\ast})  0$. Let $x_{c}^{\\ast}$ be the steady-state value of $x$ at the bifurcation point.\nThe condition $\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{J}^{\\ast}) = 0$ implies:\n$$\nk_{y} - \\frac{J}{x_{c}^{\\ast}} = 0 \\implies x_{c}^{\\ast} = \\frac{J}{k_{y}}\n$$\nWe check the sign of the determinant at this point:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Det}(\\mathbf{J}^{\\ast})\\Big|_{x^{\\ast}=x_{c}^{\\ast}} = k_{y}\\frac{J - 2\\,k_{x}\\,x_{c}^{\\ast}}{x_{c}^{\\ast}} = k_{y}\\frac{J - 2\\,k_{x}\\,(J/k_{y})}{J/k_{y}} = k_{y}^{2}\\frac{J(1 - 2k_{x}/k_{y})}{J} = k_{y}(k_{y} - 2\\,k_{x})\n$$\nGiven the assumption $k_{y}  2\\,k_{x}$, we have $k_{y} - 2\\,k_{x}  0$. Since $k_{y}  0$, it follows that $\\mathrm{Det}(\\mathbf{J}^{\\ast})  0$ at the bifurcation point, as required for a Hopf bifurcation.\n\nFinally, we find the critical parameter value $\\alpha_{c}$ corresponding to $x^{\\ast}=x_{c}^{\\ast}$. The steady state must satisfy the quadratic relation derived from combining equations $(3)$ and $(4)$:\n$k_{x}\\,x^{\\ast} + k_y \\left(\\frac{k_y}{\\alpha\\,x^{\\ast}}\\right) = J \\implies k_{x}\\,\\alpha\\,(x^{\\ast})^2 - J\\,\\alpha\\,x^{\\ast} + k_{y}^2 = 0$.\nAt the bifurcation, $\\alpha = \\alpha_{c}$ and $x^{\\ast} = x_{c}^{\\ast} = J/k_{y}$. Substituting these into the quadratic equation:\n$$\nk_{x}\\,\\alpha_{c}\\left(\\frac{J}{k_{y}}\\right)^{2} - J\\,\\alpha_{c}\\left(\\frac{J}{k_{y}}\\right) + k_{y}^{2} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_{c}\\left(k_{x}\\frac{J^{2}}{k_{y}^{2}} - \\frac{J^{2}}{k_{y}}\\right) = -k_{y}^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_{c}\\frac{J^{2}}{k_{y}^{2}}(k_{x} - k_{y}) = -k_{y}^{2}\n$$\nSolving for $\\alpha_{c}$:\n$$\n\\alpha_{c} = \\frac{-k_{y}^{2} \\cdot k_{y}^{2}}{J^{2}(k_{x} - k_{y})} = \\frac{-k_{y}^{4}}{J^{2}(k_{x} - k_{y})} = \\frac{k_{y}^{4}}{J^{2}(k_{y} - k_{x})}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the critical activation level.
