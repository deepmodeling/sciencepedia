The parameter values are within physically plausible ranges for a eukaryotic nucleus. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary information provided to derive the requested quantities. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe solution requires two main steps: first, calculating the promoter occupancy $\\theta$, and second, using $\\theta$ to find the total transcription rate for the gene. The problem statement requires an explicit justification regarding the sequestration of the transcription factor (TF) by the promoter sites.\n\nFirst, we must determine the total molar concentration of promoter sites, designated $[P]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, within the nuclear volume. A diploid cell contains $2$ alleles of the Per gene, and each has one E-box. Thus, there are $N_P = 2$ binding sites per nucleus. The nuclear volume is given as $V_{\\mathrm{nuc}} = 0.50 \\ \\mathrm{pL}$, which must be converted to liters: $V_{\\mathrm{nuc}} = 0.50 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{L}$.

The ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{[P]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{[T]_{\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{6.642 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{M}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{M}} \\approx 1.33 \\times 10^{-4}\n$$\nSince $[P]_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\ll [T]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, the concentration of binding sites is less than $0.02\\%$ of the total TF concentration. This means that even if all promoter sites were bound, the amount of sequestered TF would be a negligible fraction of the total TF pool. We are therefore justified in making the common and critical approximation that the concentration of free TF, $[T]$, is equal to the total TF concentration, $[T]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\n$$\n[T] \\approx [T]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{M}\n$$\nWith this justification, we can compute the promoter occupancy, $\\theta$, defined as the fraction of bound promoter sites, $\\theta = \\frac{[PT]}{[P]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$. From the definition of the dissociation constant, $K_d = \\frac{[T][P]}{[PT]}$. The total concentration of promoter sites is the sum of free and bound sites: $[P]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [P] + [PT]$. Substituting $[P] = [P]_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [PT]$ into the $K_d$ expression yields $K_d = \\frac{[T]([P]_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [PT])}{[PT]}$.

The model is a two-state system for each allele: either unbound (off) with rate $r_{\\mathrm{off}}$ or bound (on) with rate $r_{\\mathrm{on}}$. The probability of an allele being in the bound state is the occupancy $\\theta$, and the probability of being in the unbound state is $1-\\theta$.

By rearranging this expression, we solve for $Q_{10}$:\n$$Q_{10} = \\left( \\frac{k(T_2)}{k(T_1)} \\right)^{\\frac{10^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}}{T_2 - T_1}}$$\nNow, we substitute the relationship between the rate ratio and the period ratio for the circadian oscillator into this equation:\n$$Q_{10} = \\left( \\frac{\\tau_1}{\\tau_2} \\right)^{\\frac{10^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}}{T_2 - T_1}}$$\nThis is the required expression relating the temperature coefficient $Q_{10}$ to the periods $\\tau_1$ and $\\tau_2$ measured at temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$, respectively.\n\nWe now proceed to calculate the numerical value using the provided data.\nThe temperatures are $T_1 = 30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and $T_2 = 37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\nThe period measurements at $T_1$ are $23.88$, $23.95$, and $23.92$ hours. The problem states to use the sample mean as the point estimate for the true period $\\tau_1$:\n$$\\tau_1 = \\frac{23.88 + 23.95 + 23.92}{3} = \\frac{71.75}{3} \\text{ hours}$$\nThe period measurements at $T_2$ are $24.05$, $24.00$, and $24.08$ hours. The sample mean for $\\tau_2$ is:\n$$\\tau_2 = \\frac{24.05 + 24.00 + 24.08}{3} = \\frac{72.13}{3} \\text{ hours}$$\nThe temperature difference is $T_2 - T_1 = 37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} - 30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} = 7^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived expression for $Q_{10}$:\n$$Q_{10} = \\left( \\frac{71.75/3}{72.13/3} \\right)^{\\frac{10}{7}} = \\left( \\frac{71.75}{72.13} \\right)^{\\frac{10}{7}}$$\nWe perform the calculation:\n$$Q_{10} \\approx (0.9947317)^{\\frac{10}{7}} \\approx (0.9947317)^{1.428571} \\approx 0.992504$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the period-based temperature coefficient is $0.9925$.\n\nFinally, we must assess whether temperature compensation is achieved. A perfectly temperature-compensated system would exhibit no change in period with temperature, meaning $\\tau_1 = \\tau_2$, which would yield a $Q_{10}$ of exactly $1$. Most simple, unregulated biochemical reactions exhibit a strong temperature dependence, with $Q_{10}$ values typically between $2$ and $3$. This means their rates double or triple with a $10^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ increase in temperature. The calculated value of $Q_{10} = 0.9925$ is remarkably close to $1$. This indicates that the circadian oscillator's period is nearly stable across the physiological temperature range tested, changing by only a very small amount for a significant $7^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ change. This property is the hallmark of a temperature-compensated circadian clock. Therefore, based on the data and our analysis, the system exhibits strong temperature compensation, a critical adaptive feature for biological timekeeping.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9925}$$", "id": "2577564"}]}
