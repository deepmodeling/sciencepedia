Conductance, which we denote as $G$, is a measure of how easily electric current flows through a material for a given voltage. By analogy, for ion flow across a biological membrane, it is the ratio of the ion current ($I$) to the driving electrochemical potential. In this specific case, the proton current via UCP1 ($I_{\\text{H}^+}$) is driven by the membrane potential ($\\Delta\\psi$), as the pH gradient is stated to be negligible.

The difference represents the oxygen consumption rate that fuels the proton pumping needed to compensate for the UCP1-mediated leak.\n\n$$\\Delta J_{\\text{O}_2, \\text{UCP1}} = J_{\\text{O}_2, \\text{total}} - J_{\\text{O}_2, \\text{basal}} = (32 - 14) \\text{ pmol O}_2 \\text{ s}^{-1} \\text{ mg}^{-1} = 18 \\text{ pmol O}_2 \\text{ s}^{-1} \\text{ mg}^{-1}$$\n\nSecond, we convert this rate of oxygen consumption to the corresponding rate of proton flux. The problem states a stoichiometry of $20$ protons pumped per molecule of $\\text{O}_2$ reduced ($S_{\\text{H}^+/\\text{O}_2} = 20$). In a steady state, the rate of protons pumped out by the electron transport chain must be equal to the rate of protons leaking back into the matrix.
