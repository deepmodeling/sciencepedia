Consider the synthesis of palmitate (hexadecanoate, a saturated 16-carbon fatty acid) from cytosolic acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) by the cytosolic fatty acid synthase system, followed hypothetically by complete mitochondrial oxidation of palmitate to carbon dioxide and water. Assume the following foundational biochemical facts as your starting point:\n\n- In cytosolic fatty acid synthesis, the chain is initiated by one acetyl-CoA primer and elongated by iterative addition of two-carbon units via decarboxylative condensation of malonyl groups. Each elongation cycle involves a condensation, a $\\beta$-keto reduction, a dehydration, and an enoyl reduction, with the two reductions each consuming one nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced) (NADPH).\n- Malonyl-CoA is produced from acetyl-CoA and bicarbonate by acetyl-CoA carboxylase, consuming 1 adenosine triphosphate (ATP) per malonyl-CoA formed.\n- Ignore any ATP costs of generating cytosolic acetyl-CoA from mitochondria or of transporting reducing equivalents; assume all acetyl-CoA is already cytosolic, and the minimal stoichiometric requirements of the fatty acid synthase system apply.\n- For mitochondrial fatty acid catabolism, each round of $\\beta$-oxidation of a saturated even-chain acyl-CoA yields 1 flavin adenine dinucleotide (reduced) (FADH$_2$) and 1 nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced) (NADH), and shortens the chain by 2 carbons, producing acetyl-CoA. Each acetyl-CoA oxidized via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle yields 3 NADH, 1 FADH$_2$, and 1 guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which is energetically equivalent to 1 ATP.\n- Oxidative phosphorylation yields 2.5 ATP per NADH and 1.5 ATP per FADH$_2$. Activating a free fatty acid to an acyl-CoA for $\\beta$-oxidation consumes ATP to AMP and pyrophosphate, which is counted as 2 ATP equivalents.\n\nTasks:\n1. Derive the minimal NADPH and ATP requirements to synthesize one palmitate molecule from cytosolic acetyl-CoA under the above assumptions.\n2. Derive the total ATP yield from complete oxidation of one palmitate molecule to carbon dioxide and water under the above assumptions.\n3. For an integrated comparison on a single energetic scale, convert the NADPH and ATP costs of synthesis into ATP equivalents by treating one NADPH as energetically equivalent to one NADH donating to Complex I (that is, 2.5 ATP per NADPH), and compute the net ATP equivalents gained when one molecule of palmitate, after being synthesized as above, is completely oxidized.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single number equal to the net ATP equivalents per palmitate molecule. No rounding is required. Do not include units in your final answer. State any intermediate stoichiometries you use clearly in your reasoning.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. It presents a standard biochemical stoichiometry calculation based on established pathways and explicitly defined energetic conversion factors. It is free of contradictions or vagueness. Therefore, a solution will be derived. The problem is divided into three distinct tasks, which will be addressed in sequence.\n\nThe subject of this analysis is palmitate, a 16-carbon backbone, chemical formula $\\text{CH}_3(\\text{CH}_2)_{14}\\text{COOH}$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the anabolic pathway: the synthesis of one molecule of palmitate from cytosolic `acetyl-CoA`.\nThe synthesis of a $C_{16}$ fatty acid requires $16/2 = 8$ molecules of `acetyl-CoA`. The process is initiated by 1 molecule of `acetyl-CoA` serving as a primer. The chain is then elongated by the sequential addition of 2-carbon units derived from `malonyl-CoA`. To achieve a 16-carbon chain from a 2-carbon primer, 7 elongation cycles are necessary, each utilizing one molecule of `malonyl-CoA`.\n\nThe first sub-task is to determine the cost of producing the required 7 molecules of `malonyl-CoA`. According to the problem statement, the carboxylation of `acetyl-CoA` by acetyl-CoA carboxylase consumes 1 molecule of ATP per molecule of `malonyl-CoA` formed.\nThe stoichiometric cost is therefore:\n$$\n\\text{ATP Cost}_1 = 7 \\text{ malonyl-CoA} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ ATP}}{1 \\text{ malonyl-CoA}} = 7 \\text{ ATP}\n$$\nThe synthesis reaction is:\n$$\n7 \\text{ Acetyl-CoA} + 7 \\text{ CO}_2 + 7 \\text{ ATP} \\rightarrow 7 \\text{ Malonyl-CoA} + 7 \\text{ ADP} + 7 \\text{ P}_i\n$$\n\nThe second sub-task for synthesis is to account for the reducing equivalents consumed during the elongation cycles. The problem states that each of the 7 cycles requires 2 molecules of NADPH for the two reduction steps (the $\\beta$-ketoacyl-ACP reductase and enoyl-ACP reductase reactions).\nThe stoichiometric requirement for NADPH is:\n$$\n\\text{NADPH Cost} = 7 \\text{ cycles} \\times \\frac{2 \\text{ NADPH}}{1 \\text{ cycle}} = 14 \\text{ NADPH}\n$$\nThe overall reaction for the fatty acid synthase complex can be summarized as:\n$$\n1 \\text{ Acetyl-CoA} + 7 \\text{ Malonyl-CoA} + 14 \\text{ NADPH} + 14 \\text{ H}^+ \\rightarrow \\text{Palmitate} + 8 \\text{ CoA} + 7 \\text{ CO}_2 + 14 \\text{ NADP}^+ + 6 \\text{ H}_2\\text{O}\n$$\nCombining these costs, the complete stoichiometry for the synthesis of one molecule of palmitate from 8 molecules of `acetyl-CoA` is:\n$$\n8 \\text{ Acetyl-CoA} + 7 \\text{ ATP} + 14 \\text{ NADPH} + 14 \\text{ H}^+ \\rightarrow \\text{Palmitate} + 8 \\text{ CoA} + 7 \\text{ ADP} + 7 \\text{ P}_i + 14 \\text{ NADP}^+ + 6 \\text{ H}_2\\text{O}\n$$\nThus, for the first task, the minimal requirements to synthesize one molecule of palmitate are 7 ATP and 14 NADPH.\n\nSecond, we analyze the catabolic pathway: the complete mitochondrial oxidation of one molecule of palmitate to $\\text{CO}_2$ and $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$.\nThis process begins with the activation of the free fatty acid to its acyl-CoA derivative, palmitoyl-CoA. This activation step consumes ATP to form AMP and pyrophosphate (`PP_i`), and the subsequent hydrolysis of `PP_i` makes the reaction irreversible. This is energetically equivalent to the hydrolysis of two high-energy phosphate bonds. The cost is specified as 2 ATP equivalents.\n$$\n\\text{Activation Cost} = 2 \\text{ ATP equivalents}\n$$\nThe $C_{16}$ palmitoyl-CoA molecule then undergoes $\\beta$-oxidation. For a saturated fatty acid with $n$ carbons, the number of $\\beta$-oxidation cycles is given by $n/2 - 1$. For palmitate ($n=16$), this is:\n$$\n\\text{Number of Cycles} = \\frac{16}{2} - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7 \\text{ cycles}\n$$\nEach cycle yields 1 FADH$_2$ and 1 NADH. Therefore, 7 cycles produce:\n$$\n7 \\text{ cycles} \\times 1 \\text{ FADH}_2/\\text{cycle} = 7 \\text{ FADH}_2\n$$\n$$\n7 \\text{ cycles} \\times 1 \\text{ NADH}/\\text{cycle} = 7 \\text{ NADH}\n$$\nThe $\\beta$-oxidation process also produces $n/2$ molecules of `acetyl-CoA`. For palmitate, this is:\n$$\n\\text{Number of Acetyl-CoA} = \\frac{16}{2} = 8 \\text{ acetyl-CoA}\n$$\nEach of these 8 molecules of `acetyl-CoA` enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, where it is completely oxidized. The yield per `acetyl-CoA` in the TCA cycle is stated as 3 NADH, 1 FADH$_2$, and 1 GTP. The total yield from 8 molecules of `acetyl-CoA` is:\n$$\n\\text{Yield from TCA} = 8 \\times (3 \\text{ NADH} + 1 \\text{ FADH}_2 + 1 \\text{ GTP}) = 24 \\text{ NADH} + 8 \\text{ FADH}_2 + 8 \\text{ GTP}\n$$\nWe now sum all products from the complete oxidation of palmitate:\n$$\n\\text{Total NADH} = 7 \\text{ (from } \\beta\\text{-oxidation)} + 24 \\text{ (from TCA cycle)} = 31 \\text{ NADH}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Total FADH}_2 = 7 \\text{ (from } \\beta\\text{-oxidation)} + 8 \\text{ (from TCA cycle)} = 15 \\text{ FADH}_2\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Total substrate-level phosphorylation} = 8 \\text{ GTP}\n$$\nNow, we convert these energy carriers into ATP equivalents using the given yields from oxidative phosphorylation: 2.5 ATP/NADH and 1.5 ATP/FADH$_2$. The GTP is considered equivalent to ATP.\n$$\n\\text{ATP from NADH} = 31 \\text{ NADH} \\times 2.5 \\frac{\\text{ATP}}{\\text{NADH}} = 77.5 \\text{ ATP}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{ATP from FADH}_2 = 15 \\text{ FADH}_2 \\times 1.5 \\frac{\\text{ATP}}{\\text{FADH}_2} = 22.5 \\text{ ATP}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{ATP from GTP} = 8 \\text{ GTP} \\times 1 \\frac{\\text{ATP}}{\\text{GTP}} = 8 \\text{ ATP}\n$$\nThe gross ATP yield is the sum of these contributions:\n$$\n\\text{Gross ATP yield} = 77.5 + 22.5 + 8 = 108 \\text{ ATP}\n$$\nTo find the net yield, we subtract the initial activation cost:\n$$\n\\text{Net ATP yield} = \\text{Gross ATP yield} - \\text{Activation Cost} = 108 \\text{ ATP} - 2 \\text{ ATP} = 106 \\text{ ATP}\n$$\nThus, for the second task, the total ATP yield from one molecule of palmitate is 106 ATP.\n\nThird, we calculate the net energetic gain for the entire integrated process of synthesis followed by oxidation. This requires converting all costs and yields to the common currency of ATP equivalents.\nThe total cost of synthesis must be expressed in ATP equivalents. The cost was found to be 7 ATP and 14 NADPH. The problem specifies that 1 NADPH is to be treated as energetically equivalent to 1 NADH, which yields 2.5 ATP.\n$$\n\\text{Synthesis Cost in ATP Equiv.} = (7 \\text{ ATP}) + \\left(14 \\text{ NADPH} \\times 2.5 \\frac{\\text{ATP Equiv.}}{\\text{NADPH}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Synthesis Cost in ATP Equiv.} = 7 + 35 = 42 \\text{ ATP equivalents}\n$$\nThe net gain is the total ATP yield from oxidation minus the total ATP-equivalent cost of synthesis.\n$$\n\\text{Net ATP Gain} = \\text{Net ATP yield from oxidation} - \\text{Synthesis Cost in ATP Equiv.}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Net ATP Gain} = 106 - 42 = 64\n$$\nTherefore, the net gain for the cycle of synthesizing one molecule of palmitate and then completely oxidizing it is 64 ATP equivalents.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{64}\n$$", "id": "2576411"}, {"introduction": "The tricarboxylic acid ($TCA$) cycle is the central hub of cellular metabolism, but its role extends beyond simple energy generation.

This exercise models a classic example in lipogenic cells, challenging you to calculate the anaplerotic flux required to maintain the $TCA$ cycle's integrity when citrate is withdrawn for fatty acid synthesis [@problem_id:2576334], demonstrating the principle of mass balance essential for sustaining integrated metabolic networks.", "problem": "In a lipogenic hepatocyte at steady state, the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle pool of four-carbon intermediates is maintained despite continuous citrate export to the cytosol for fatty acid synthesis.

Express your final answer in nmol min$^{-1}$ mg$^{-1}$ and round your answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the minimal pyruvate carboxylase flux, denoted as $J_{\\mathrm{PC,min}}$, necessary to maintain a steady state for the pool of four-carbon ($C_4$) intermediates within the mitochondrion of a lipogenic hepatocyte. The principle guiding the solution is the conservation of mass. At steady state, the total rate at which $C_4$ intermediates are removed from the mitochondrial pool (cataplerosis) must be exactly balanced by the total rate at which they are replenished (anaplerosis).\n\nFirst, we identify the givens:\n- Citrate synthase flux: $J_{\\mathrm{CS}} = 110$ nmol min$^{-1}$ mg$^{-1}$.\n- Citrate efflux flux from mitochondrion to cytosol: $J_{\\mathrm{efflux}} = 80$ nmol min$^{-1}$ mg$^{-1}$.\n- Fraction of cytosolic oxaloacetate (OAA) converted to pyruvate: $\\alpha = 0.40$.\n- The system is at steady state, meaning the size of the mitochondrial $C_4$ intermediate pool (oxaloacetate, malate, fumarate, succinate) is constant.\n- The only anaplerotic pathways considered are pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and the re-import of malate. The only cataplerotic pathway is citrate export.\n\nLet us analyze the fluxes affecting the mitochondrial $C_4$ pool.\n\nThe cataplerotic flux is the net rate of removal of intermediates from the TCA cycle. Citrate is synthesized in the mitochondrion from acetyl-CoA and a $C_4$ intermediate, oxaloacetate (OAA). A portion of this citrate, with flux $J_{\\mathrm{efflux}}$, is exported to the cytosol. Each molecule of citrate exported represents the effective removal of one molecule of OAA from the mitochondrial pool. The portion of citrate that remains in the mitochondrion continues through the TCA cycle and is regenerated back into OAA, resulting in no net loss for that fraction of the flux. Therefore, the total rate of depletion of the mitochondrial $C_4$ pool is equal to the citrate efflux rate.\n$$J_{\\mathrm{cataplerosis}} = J_{\\mathrm{efflux}}$$\n\nThe anaplerotic flux is the rate of replenishment of this pool. The problem states two sources for replenishment:\n1. The flux from pyruvate carboxylase, $J_{\\mathrm{PC}}$, which converts pyruvate ($C_3$) into OAA ($C_4$).\n2. The re-import of malate ($C_4$) from the cytosol. Let us denote this flux as $J_{\\mathrm{malate,import}}$.\n\nThe total anaplerotic flux is the sum of these contributions:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{anaplerosis}} = J_{\\mathrm{PC}} + J_{\\mathrm{malate,import}}$$\n\nFor the $C_4$ pool to be at steady state, the anaplerotic and cataplerotic fluxes must be equal:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{anaplerosis}} = J_{\\mathrm{cataplerosis}}$$\n$$J_{\\mathrm{PC}} + J_{\\mathrm{malate,import}} = J_{\\mathrm{efflux}}$$\n\nTo solve for $J_{\\mathrm{PC}}$, we must first determine $J_{\\mathrm{malate,import}}$. This flux originates from the metabolic fate of the exported citrate. In the cytosol, citrate is cleaved by ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) back into acetyl-CoA and OAA. The rate of cytosolic OAA formation is equal to the rate of citrate efflux, $J_{\\mathrm{efflux}}$.\nThis cytosolic OAA partitions into two pathways:\n- A fraction $\\alpha$ is converted to pyruvate.\n- The remaining fraction, $(1-\\alpha)$, is reduced to malate and reimported into the mitochondrion.\n\nTherefore, the flux of malate re-import is:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{malate,import}} = (1 - \\alpha) J_{\\mathrm{efflux}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression back into our steady-state balance equation:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{PC}} + (1 - \\alpha) J_{\\mathrm{efflux}} = J_{\\mathrm{efflux}}$$\n\nWe can now solve for $J_{\\mathrm{PC}}$:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{PC}} = J_{\\mathrm{efflux}} - (1 - \\alpha) J_{\\mathrm{efflux}}$$\n$$J_{\\mathrm{PC}} = J_{\\mathrm{efflux}} (1 - (1 - \\alpha))$$\n$$J_{\\mathrm{PC}} = J_{\\mathrm{efflux}} (1 - 1 + \\alpha)$$\n$$J_{\\mathrm{PC}} = \\alpha J_{\\mathrm{efflux}}$$\n\nThis result shows that the required pyruvate carboxylase flux is precisely the flux of carbon skeletons that are diverted to pyruvate in the cytosol and not returned to the mitochondrion as malate. Since PC is the only other specified anaplerotic pathway, this required flux is the minimal flux needed to maintain the steady state, so $J_{\\mathrm{PC,min}} = J_{\\mathrm{PC}}$.\n\nWe substitute the given numerical values to find the answer:\n- $J_{\\mathrm{efflux}} = 80$ nmol min$^{-1}$ mg$^{-1}$\n- $\\alpha = 0.40$\n\n$$J_{\\mathrm{PC,min}} = 0.40 \\times 80 \\text{ nmol min}^{-1} \\text{ mg}^{-1}$$\n$$J_{\\mathrm{PC,min}} = 32 \\text{ nmol min}^{-1} \\text{ mg}^{-1}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Thus, $32$ becomes $32.0$. The value for $J_{\\mathrm{CS}}$ ($110$ nmol min$^{-1}$ mg$^{-1}$), while part of the overall metabolic context, is not directly needed for this calculation but serves as a consistency check for an alternative formulation of the node balance for OAA, which yields the identical result.\n\nThe net loss of $C_4$ units from the mitochondrial cycle is determined by the fraction $\\alpha$ of exported carbon that is not returned, which must be replenished by pyruvate carboxylase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{32.0}$$", "id": "2576334"}, {"introduction": "Metabolic integration requires not just balancing pathways, but actively regulating the flow of metabolites at critical branch points to meet shifting cellular demands.
