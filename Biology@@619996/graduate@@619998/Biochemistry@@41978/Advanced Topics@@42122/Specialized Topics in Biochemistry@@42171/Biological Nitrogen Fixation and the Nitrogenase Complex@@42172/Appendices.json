It contains no scientific unsoundness, ambiguity, or contradiction.\n\nVerdict: The problem is valid. A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe solution requires a careful accounting of all electrons transferred during the process, as this dictates both the number of Fe protein turnovers and the total ATP consumption.\n\nFirst, we establish the stoichiometry for the primary chemical transformation: the reduction of dinitrogen ($\\mathrm{N_2}$) to two molecules of ammonia ($\\mathrm{NH_3}$). The oxidation state of nitrogen in $\\mathrm{N_2}$ is $0$. The oxidation state of nitrogen in $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ is $-3$.

The total number of ATP molecules hydrolyzed, $n_{\\text{ATP}}$, is therefore the product of the number of turnovers and the ATP cost per turnover.\n$$\nn_{\\text{ATP}} = n_{\\text{turnovers}} \\times (\\text{ATP per turnover}) = 8 \\times 2 = 16\n$$\n\nThe minimal number of Fe protein turnovers required is $8$, and the total number of ATP hydrolyses is $16$.

The stoichiometric values provided (e.g., ATP-to-electron ratio, electron requirements for $N_{2}$ and $H^{+}$ reduction) are canonical and widely accepted in scientific literature.

There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. The value of $r=2.3$ is within the range observed experimentally for various diazotrophs under different physiological conditions. Thus, the problem is not unrealistic or based on flawed premises.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the ATP Cost per Mole of Ammonia**\n\nLet us analyze the stoichiometry of electron and ATP consumption. The nitrogenase complex partitions the total electron flux into two reactions: the reduction of dinitrogen and the reduction of protons.\n\nThe reduction of one mole of dinitrogen to two moles of ammonia is given by:\n$$N_{2} + 6e^{-} + 6H^{+} \\rightarrow 2NH_{3}$$\nThis reaction consumes $n_{e^{-},N_{2}} = 6$ moles of electrons per mole of $N_{2}$ reduced.\n\nThe reduction of protons to dihydrogen is given by:\n$$2H^{+} + 2e^{-} \\rightarrow H_{2}$$\nThis reaction consumes $n_{e^{-},H_{2}} = 2$ moles of electrons per mole of $H_{2}$ produced.\n\nThe problem states that for every $1$ mole of $N_{2}$ that is reduced, $r$ moles of $H_{2}$ are evolved. Therefore, we can establish a basis of calculation for the reduction of $1$ mole of $N_{2}$.\n\nThe total number of moles of electrons, $n_{e^{-},\\text{total}}$, consumed per mole of $N_{2}$ reduced is the sum of electrons used for both processes:\n$$n_{e^{-},\\text{total}} = n_{e^{-},N_{2}} + r \\cdot n_{e^{-},H_{2}}$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$n_{e^{-},\\text{total}} = 6 + r \\cdot 2 = 6 + 2r$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the hydrolysis of $k_{\\text{ATP}/e^{-}} = 2$ molecules of ATP is required for every single electron transferred through the complex. Therefore, the total number of moles of ATP hydrolyzed per mole of $N_{2}$ reduced, $N_{\\text{ATP}}$, is:\n$$N_{\\text{ATP}} = n_{e^{-},\\text{total}} \\times k_{\\text{ATP}/e^{-}}$$\n$$N_{\\text{ATP}} = (6 + 2r) \\times 2 = 12 + 4r$$\n\nThis quantity, $N_{\\text{ATP}}$, represents the total ATP cost for reducing $1$ mole of $N_{2}$ and concurrently producing $r$ moles of $H_{2}$. The reduction of $1$ mole of $N_{2}$ yields $2$ moles of $NH_{3}$. The question asks for the ATP cost per mole of ammonia, which we denote as $C_{\\mathrm{ATP/NH_{3}}}(r)$. This is found by dividing the total ATP cost by the moles of ammonia produced:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{ATP/NH_{3}}}(r) = \\frac{N_{\\text{ATP}}}{2} = \\frac{12 + 4r}{2}$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{ATP/NH_{3}}}(r) = 6 + 2r$$\nThis is the required symbolic expression for the ATP cost per mole of ammonia as a function of the ratio $r$.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate this expression for $r = 2.3$.\n$$C_{\\mathrm{ATP/NH_{3}}}(2.3) = 6 + 2(2.3) = 6 + 4.6 = 10.6$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, the value is $10.60$. The units are moles of ATP per mole of $NH_{3}$.\n\n**Justification for the Thermodynamic Trade-off**\n\nThe minimal reaction stoichiometry for nitrogenase is often considered to be $N_2 + 8H^+ + 8e^- \\to 2NH_3 + H_2$. This corresponds to a baseline evolution of one mole of $H_2$ for every mole of $N_2$ reduced, meaning $r=1$. This is viewed as an obligatory part of the catalytic cycle. A deviation where $r > 1$ signifies that a larger fraction of electrons is being diverted to proton reduction at the expense of dinitrogen reduction.\n\nThis phenomenon reflects a critical thermodynamic trade-off. The reduction of dinitrogen ($N \\equiv N$) is an exceptionally challenging chemical transformation due to the immense strength of the triple bond. To overcome this large activation energy barrier, the MoFe protein active site must be maintained in a highly reduced, and thus thermodynamically potent, state. This state is achieved through a series of ATP-dependent electron transfers from the Fe protein.\n\nHowever, this highly energetic reduced state is not perfectly selective for $N_2$. It is also capable of reducing protons ($H^+$), which are abundantly available in the aqueous environment. The reduction of protons to $H_2$ ($E^{\\circ'} \\approx -0.42 \\, \\text{V}$ at pH $7$) is thermodynamically more favorable than the initial electron transfers required to activate $N_2$.\n\nConsequently, if the rate of electron delivery to the MoFe protein exceeds the rate at which it can bind and reduce $N_2$ (which might be limited by $N_2$ concentration or other factors), the excess reducing equivalents are \"leaked\" to the most accessible substrate, which is $H^+$. This results in $H_2$ evolution where $r>1$. The \"trade-off\" is thus between maintaining a high electron flux and a highly reduced catalytic site (kinetic readiness) versus maximizing the energetic efficiency of substrate conversion (minimal ATP cost per $NH_3$). Spending energy via ATP hydrolysis to pump electrons into the MoFe protein ensures the enzyme is always \"primed\" for the difficult $N_2$ reduction, but this high-energy state inevitably leads to some energy dissipation through the futile cycle of proton reduction, lowering overall efficiency. A higher value of $r$ indicates a greater degree of this uncoupling between electron flow and productive ammonia synthesis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10.60}$$", "id": "2546469"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the energetic cost per reaction, we now scale our analysis to the level of a whole cell to understand its physiological output.
