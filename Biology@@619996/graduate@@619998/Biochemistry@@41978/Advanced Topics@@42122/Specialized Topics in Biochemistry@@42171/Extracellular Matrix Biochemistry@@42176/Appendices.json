Consider a cartilage specimen with a measured fixed charge density of magnitude $0.25$ mol per liter of wet tissue and a water volume fraction of $\\phi_{w} = 0.80$. The tissue is equilibrated against a bath of monovalent salt (sodium chloride) at concentration $c_{0} = 0.15$ mol per liter, at temperature $T = 310$ K.

The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient information to determine a unique solution for the requested quantities (ionic concentrations and osmotic pressure). All provided values are physically realistic for articular cartilage. The language is objective and precise. The assumptions, such as ideal solution behavior and neglecting contributions from polymer mixing or elasticity, are explicitly stated, defining a clear, solvable physical model. There are no violations of scientific principles, no contradictions, and no ambiguities.\n\nStep 3: Verdict.\nThe problem is deemed valid. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe physical system consists of two compartments: the internal tissue phase and the external bath. The boundary is permeable to water and the mobile ions ($Na^+$ and $Cl^-$) but impermeable to the fixed negative charges within the tissue matrix. Equilibrium is governed by two principles: the equality of the electrochemical potential of each mobile ion across the boundary, and electroneutrality within each compartment.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the concentration of fixed negative charges, denoted $c_F$, within the water phase of the tissue. The given density is $0.25$ mol per liter of bulk tissue, and the water fraction is $\\phi_w = 0.80$. The concentration in the water volume is therefore:\n$$c_F = \\frac{0.25 \\text{ mol L}^{-1}}{0.80} = 0.3125 \\text{ mol L}^{-1}$$\n\nLet the inner (tissue) and outer (bath) compartments be denoted by subscripts '$i$' and '$o$', respectively. The electrochemical potential $\\mu_j$ for an ionic species $j$ with valency $z_j$ and concentration $c_j$ at an electrical potential $\\psi$ is given by $\\mu_j = \\mu_j^0 + RT \\ln(c_j) + z_j F \\psi$, where $\\mu_j^0$ is the standard chemical potential and $F$ is the Faraday constant.\n\nAt equilibrium, the electrochemical potential for each mobile ion must be equal in both compartments. Let $\\psi_o = 0$ and $\\psi_i = \\psi$ (the Donnan potential).\nFor $Na^+$ ($z_{Na^+} = +1$):\n$$RT \\ln([Na^+]_i) + (1) F \\psi = RT \\ln([Na^+]_o)$$\nFor $Cl^-$ ($z_{Cl^-} = -1$):\n$$RT \\ln([Cl^-]_i) + (-1) F \\psi = RT \\ln([Cl^-]_o)$$\n\nFrom these equations, we can express the Donnan potential:\n$$\\frac{F\\psi}{RT} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{[Na^+]_o}{[Na^+]_i}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{[Cl^-]_i}{[Cl^-]_o}\\right)$$\nThis yields the classical Donnan relationship, where the ratio of mobile cations is the inverse of the ratio of mobile anions:\n$$\\frac{[Na^+]_i}{[Na^+]_o} = \\frac{[Cl^-]_o}{[Cl^-]_i}$$\nThis rearranges to the ion-product equality:\n$$[Na^+]_i [Cl^-]_i = [Na^+]_o [Cl^-]_o$$\nIn the external bath, electroneutrality requires $[Na^+]_o = [Cl^-]_o = c_0$. Thus:\n$$[Na^+]_i [Cl^-]_i = c_0^2$$\n\nThe second condition is electroneutrality within the tissue phase. The sum of positive charges must balance the sum of negative charges:\n$$[Na^+]_i = [Cl^-]_i + c_F$$\nNote that $c_F$ represents the magnitude of the fixed charge concentration.\n\nWe now have a system of two algebraic equations for the two unknown internal concentrations, $[Na^+]_i$ and $[Cl^-]_i$.\n1. $[Na^+]_i [Cl^-]_i = c_0^2$\n2. $[Na^+]_i - [Cl^-]_i = c_F$\n\nSubstitute (2) into (1):\n$$([Cl^-]_i + c_F) [Cl^-]_i = c_0^2$$\n$$[Cl^-]_i^2 + c_F [Cl^-]_i - c_0^2 = 0$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $[Cl^-]_i$. The physically meaningful solution (since concentration must be positive) is obtained using the quadratic formula:\n$$[Cl^-]_i = \\frac{-c_F + \\sqrt{c_F^2 + 4c_0^2}}{2}$$\nUsing the given values, $c_F = 0.3125$ M and $c_0 = 0.15$ M:\n$$[Cl^-]_i = \\frac{-0.3125 + \\sqrt{(0.3125)^2 + 4(0.15)^2}}{2} = \\frac{-0.3125 + \\sqrt{0.09765625 + 0.09}}{2}$$\n$$[Cl^-]_i = \\frac{-0.3125 + \\sqrt{0.18765625}}{2} = \\frac{-0.3125 + 0.433193}{2} \\approx 0.060347 \\text{ mol L}^{-1}$$\nNow, we find $[Na^+]_i$ using the electroneutrality condition:\n$$[Na^+]_i = [Cl^-]_i + c_F = 0.060347 + 0.3125 = 0.372847 \\text{ mol L}^{-1}$$\n\nThe osmotic swelling pressure, $\\Pi$, is given by the van 't Hoff law, arising from the difference in the total concentration of mobile ions between the tissue and the bath.\n$$\\Pi = RT (\\Delta c_{mobile})$$\n$$\\Delta c_{mobile} = \\left([Na^+]_i + [Cl^-]_i\\right) - \\left([Na^+]_o + [Cl^-]_o\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta c_{mobile} = \\left([Na^+]_i + [Cl^-]_i\\right) - 2c_0$$\nFrom the electroneutrality equation, we have $[Na^+]_i = [Cl^-]_i + c_F$, so $[Na^+]_i + [Cl^-]_i = 2[Cl^-]_i + c_F$. Substituting our solution for $[Cl^-]_i$:\n$$[Na^+]_i + [Cl^-]_i = 2\\left(\\frac{-c_F + \\sqrt{c_F^2 + 4c_0^2}}{2}\\right) + c_F = -c_F + \\sqrt{c_F^2 + 4c_0^2} + c_F = \\sqrt{c_F^2 + 4c_0^2}$$\nTherefore, the excess mobile ion concentration is:\n$$\\Delta c_{mobile} = \\sqrt{c_F^2 + 4c_0^2} - 2c_0$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\\Delta c_{mobile} = \\sqrt{(0.3125)^2 + 4(0.15)^2} - 2(0.15) = 0.433193 - 0.30 = 0.133193 \\text{ mol L}^{-1}$$\nTo calculate pressure in Pascals (Pa), which is equivalent to J m$^{-3}$, we must convert the concentration from mol L$^{-1}$ to mol m$^{-3}$.

A rigorous derivation and solution will follow.\n\nSolution Derivation:\n\nThe starting point is the differential rate law for substrate consumption, $v = -\\frac{d[S]}{dt}$, under the Michaelis-Menten kinetic model:\n$$v = -\\frac{d[S]}{dt} = \\frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_M + [S]}$$\nwhere $[S]$ is the substrate concentration, $t$ is time, $K_M$ is the Michaelis constant, and $V_{max}$ is the maximum reaction velocity, defined as $V_{max} = k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_T$. This is a separable ordinary differential equation. Rearranging for integration yields:\n$$\\frac{K_M + [S]}{[S]} d[S] = -V_{max} dt$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{K_M}{[S]} + 1\\right) d[S] = -V_{max} dt$$\nWe integrate both sides from the initial\nconditions ($t=0$, $[S]=[S]_0$) to a later time $t$ where the concentration is $[S](t)$:\n$$\\int_{[S]_0}^{[S](t)} \\left(\\frac{K_M}{[S]} + 1\\right) d[S] = \\int_0^t -V_{max} dt$$\nEvaluating the definite integrals gives:\n$$\\left[ K_M \\ln[S] + [S] \\right]_{[S]_0}^{[S](t)} = -V_{max} t$$\n$$(K_M \\ln[S](t) + [S](t)) - (K_M \\ln[S]_0 + [S]_0) = -V_{max} t$$\nThis equation is rearranged into the standard integrated Michaelis-Menten form:\n$$([S]_0 - [S](t)) + K_M \\ln\\left(\\frac{[S]_0}{[S](t)}\\right) = V_{max} t$$\nThis equation relates the amount of substrate consumed, $[S]_0 - [S](t)$, to the kinetic parameters. We will apply this equation to the data from the two experiments. For clarity in the algebraic steps, we will temporarily omit units, with the understanding that all concentrations are in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and time is in seconds.\n\nFor Experiment A: $[S]_0 = 16$, $[S](t_A) = 8$, $t_A = 120$.\nSubstituting these values into the integrated rate law:\n$$(16 - 8) + K_M \\ln\\left(\\frac{16}{8}\\right) = V_{max} \\cdot 120$$\n$$8 + K_M \\ln(2) = 120 V_{max} \\quad (1)$$\n\nFor Experiment B: $[S]_0 = 8$, $[S](t_B) = 4$, $t_B = 80$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$(8 - 4) + K_M \\ln\\left(\\frac{8}{4}\\right) = V_{max} \\cdot 80$$\n$$4 + K_M \\ln(2) = 80 V_{max} \\quad (2)$$\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $K_M$ and $V_{max}$. We can solve this system. First, express $V_{max}$ from both equations:\nFrom ($1$): $V_{max} = \\frac{8}{120} + \\frac{K_M \\ln(2)}{120} = \\frac{1}{15} + \\frac{K_M \\ln(2)}{120}$\nFrom ($2$): $V_{max} = \\frac{4}{80} + \\frac{K_M \\ln(2)}{80} = \\frac{1}{20} + \\frac{K_M \\ln(2)}{80}$\n\nEquating the two expressions for $V_{max}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{15} + \\frac{K_M \\ln(2)}{120} = \\frac{1}{20} + \\frac{K_M \\ln(2)}{80}$$\nIsolating the terms with $K_M$:\n$$K_M \\ln(2) \\left(\\frac{1}{80} - \\frac{1}{120}\\right) = \\frac{1}{15} - \\frac{1}{20}$$\n$$K_M \\ln(2) \\left(\\frac{3 - 2}{240}\\right) = \\frac{4 - 3}{60}$$\n$$K_M \\ln(2) \\left(\\frac{1}{240}\\right) = \\frac{1}{60}$$\nSolving for $K_M$:\n$$K_M = \\frac{240}{60 \\ln(2)} = \\frac{4}{\\ln(2)}$$\nThe unit for $K_M$ is $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ as concentrations were in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.

It requires the implementation of an algorithm to estimate the elastic modulus from synthetic force-indentation data and to programmatically validate the assumptions underlying the physical model. The problem is valid. We will now proceed with a systematic solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the application of contact mechanics models, specifically the Hertz-Sneddon solutions for an elastic half-space indented by a rigid axisymmetric probe. The relationship between the applied normal force $F$ and the resulting indentation depth $\\delta$ depends on the indenter geometry.\n\nFor a conical indenter with a half-angle $\\alpha$, the Sneddon model gives:\n$$F(\\delta) = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} \\tan(\\alpha) \\delta^2$$\nFor a spherical indenter with radius $R$, the Hertz model gives:\n$$F(\\delta) = \\frac{4}{3} \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} \\sqrt{R} \\delta^{3/2}$$\nHere, $E$ is the Young's modulus and $\\nu$ is the Poisson's ratio of the elastic material.\n\nTo estimate the Young's modulus $E$ from a set of discrete measurements $(F_i, \\delta_i)$, we first linearize these models. Let the measured force be $y_i = F_i$.\n\nFor the conical model, we define a transformed variable $x_i = \\delta_i^2$. The model becomes a simple linear relationship passing through the origin:\n$$F = s \\cdot x \\quad \\text{where} \\quad s = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} \\tan(\\alpha)$$\nFor the spherical model, we define $x_i = \\delta_i^{3/2}$. The model again transforms into a linear relationship through the origin:\n$$F = s \\cdot x \\quad \\text{where} \\quad s = \\frac{4}{3} \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} \\sqrt{R}$$\nThe problem specifies an origin-constrained least-squares fit to estimate the slope $s$ from the data pairs $(x_i, y_i)$. The estimator for the slope, $\\hat{s}$, which minimizes the sum of squared residuals $\\sum_i (y_i - s x_i)^2$, is given by:\n$$\\hat{s} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i y_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i^2}$$\nOnce $\\hat{s}$ is computed from the data, the Young's modulus $E$ can be recovered by rearranging the expressions for the slope.\nFor the conical indenter:\n$$\\hat{E} = \\hat{s} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi (1-\\nu^2)}{2 \\tan(\\alpha)}$$\nFor the spherical indenter:\n$$\\hat{E} = \\hat{s} \\cdot \\frac{3 (1-\\nu^2)}{4 \\sqrt{R}}$$\n\nA critical part of scientific modeling is the verification of its underlying assumptions. The problem mandates a two-part validation procedure.\n\nFirst, we must check geometric constraints that ensure the applicability of the half-space model and the small-strain approximation. The contact radius, $a$, must be small relative to the sample thickness $h$. For deep indentations relative to the indenter radius (for a sphere), the small-strain assumption of the Hertz model also breaks down.\nThe contact radius is given by $a = \\delta \\tan(\\alpha)$ for a cone and $a = \\sqrt{R\\delta}$ for a sphere. Let $\\delta_{\\max}$ be the maximum indentation depth and $a_{\\max}$ be the contact radius at that depth. The geometric criteria are:\n- For a conical tip: $\\dfrac{\\delta_{\\max}}{h} \\leq 0.1$ and $\\dfrac{a_{\\max}}{h} \\leq 0.1$.\n- For a spherical tip: $\\dfrac{\\delta_{\\max}}{R} \\leq 0.1$ and $\\dfrac{a_{\\max}}{h} \\leq 0.1$.\n\nSecond, we must check for effects not included in the ideal model, such as surface adhesion or instrumental drift, which manifest as a non-zero force offset. This is assessed by fitting an affine model $F = a x + b$ to the transformed data $(x_i, F_i)$ using ordinary least squares. A significant intercept $b$ suggests the origin-constrained model is inappropriate. The criterion is:\n$$\\frac{|b|}{F_{\\max}} \\leq 0.05$$\nwhere $b$ is the intercept from the affine fit and $F_{\\max} = \\max_i |F_i|$.\nThe overall model validity is the logical conjunction of all relevant geometric and adhesion checks.\n\nThe implementation will proceed as follows for each of the four datasets provided:\n1.  Generate the synthetic data $(\\delta_i, F_i)$ according to the specified parameters, including noise and offset, using a fixed random seed for reproducibility. Angles must be converted from degrees to radians.\n2.  Calculate the transformed variable $x_i$ based on the geometry.\n3.  Compute the estimated slope $\\hat{s}$ using the origin-constrained least-squares formula.\n4.  Calculate the estimated Young's modulus $\\hat{E}$ from $\\hat{s}$.\n5.  Evaluate the geometric validity criteria using $\\delta_{\\max}$, $h$, and $R$ (if applicable).\n6.  Perform an affine fit of $F_i$ versus $x_i$ to find the intercept $b$ and evaluate the adhesion validity criterion.\n7.  Combine the validity checks to produce a single boolean flag.\n8.  Store the pair $[\\hat{E}, \\text{valid}]$, with $\\hat{E}$ rounded to two decimal places.\n\nWe now apply this procedure to each test case.\n\n**Dataset A (Conical, Valid Case):**\n- Parameters: $E=1200\\,\\text{Pa}$, $\\nu=0.49$, $\\alpha=20^\\circ$, $h=50 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}$, $\\delta_{\\max}=500 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}$, $F_0=0\\,\\text{N}$.\n- Geometric check:\n  - $\\frac{\\delta_{\\max}}{h} = \\frac{500 \\times 10^{-9}}{50 \\times 10^{-6}} = 0.01 \\leq 0.1$.
