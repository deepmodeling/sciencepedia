There is no subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard and well-formulated problem in molecular biology. I will now proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe analysis must proceed from the fundamental principles of gene regulation as applied to the given genotype and conditions.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Genetic Background**:\n    - The strain is $ lacI^{+} $, meaning it produces a functional $ \\mathrm{LacI} $ repressor protein. This protein is a trans-acting factor. In a wild-type scenario, it would be capable of binding to the operator and repressing transcription in the absence of an inducer.\n    - The strain is $ crp^{+} $ and $ cya^{+} $. This means it produces functional $ \\mathrm{CRP} $ protein and functional adenylate cyclase, the enzyme that synthesizes $ \\mathrm{cAMP} $. Therefore, the machinery for positive control (catabolite activation) is intact. The concentration of the active complex, $ \\mathrm{CRP}\\cdot \\mathrm{cAMP} $, will be high when glucose is low and low when glucose is high.\n\n2.  **Molecular Definition of the $\\mathrm{lacO}^{\\mathrm{c}}$ Mutation**:\n    - The designation $\\mathrm{lacO}$ refers to the operator, which is a specific DNA sequence. Therefore, a mutation in $\\mathrm{lacO}$ is, by definition, a **cis-acting** mutation. It affects only the operon to which it is physically linked.\n    - The superscript 'c' stands for \"constitutive\". A constitutive mutation is one that leads to continuous gene expression, bypassing the normal regulatory mechanism. In the context of the *lac* operon, which is negatively regulated by the $ \\mathrm{LacI} $ repressor, constitutive expression occurs when repression is abolished.\n    - For the $ \\mathrm{LacI} $ repressor to be unable to repress transcription, it must be prevented from binding to its target site, the $\\mathrm{lacO}$ operator. Since the $ \\mathrm{LacI} $ protein itself is functional ($ lacI^{+} $), the defect must lie in the operator sequence.\n    - Thus, a $\\mathrm{lacO}^{\\mathrm{c}}$ mutation is a change in the nucleotide sequence of the $\\mathrm{lacO}$ operator that diminishes or completely **abolishes the binding affinity of the $ \\mathrm{LacI} $ repressor protein**.\n\n3.  **Prediction of Transcriptional Output**:\n    We must evaluate the combined effect of the broken negative control and the intact positive control.\n\n    - **Effect of $\\mathrm{lacO}^{\\mathrm{c}}$ on Negative Control**: Because the $ \\mathrm{LacI} $ repressor cannot bind to the $\\mathrm{lacO}^{\\mathrm{c}}$ operator, the presence or absence of an inducer becomes irrelevant. The repressor is unable to block $ \\mathrm{RNAP} $ regardless of its conformational state. Therefore, transcription of the operon is **independent of the inducer**.\n\n    - **Effect of the Intact Positive Control System**: The promoter of the *lac* operon, $ P_{lac} $, is inherently weak. Efficient transcription requires an activator. The $ \\mathrm{CRP}\\cdot \\mathrm{cAMP} $ complex serves this role by binding to a site near the promoter and facilitating $ \\mathrm{RNAP} $ binding and initiation. This system is fully functional in the given strain.\n        - When **glucose is low**, $ \\mathrm{cAMP} $ levels are high. The $ \\mathrm{CRP}\\cdot \\mathrm{cAMP} $ complex forms and binds its target site, strongly activating transcription.\n        - When **glucose is high**, $ \\mathrm{cAMP} $ levels are low. The $ \\mathrm{CRP}\\cdot \\mathrm{cAMP} $ complex does not form in significant amounts. Without this activator, $ \\mathrm{RNAP} $ binds the promoter only weakly, resulting in a low, basal level of transcription.\n\n    - **Synthesis for the $4$ Conditions**:\n        - **Low Glucose / No Inducer**: High $ \\mathrm{CRP}\\cdot \\mathrm{cAMP} $ activates transcription. $ \\mathrm{LacI} $ cannot bind $\\mathrm{lacO}^{\\mathrm{c}}$. Result: **High transcription**.\n        - **Low Glucose / With Inducer**: High $ \\mathrm{CRP}\\cdot \\mathrm{cAMP} $ activates transcription. The inducer is irrelevant. Result: **High transcription**.\n        - **High Glucose / No Inducer**: Low $ \\mathrm{CRP}\\cdot \\mathrm{cAMP} $ leads to poor activation. $ \\mathrm{LacI} $ cannot bind $\\mathrm{lacO}^{\\mathrm{c}}$. Result: **Low/basal transcription**.\n        - **High Glucose / With Inducer**: Low $ \\mathrm{CRP}\\cdot \\mathrm{cAMP} $ leads to poor activation. The inducer is irrelevant. Result: **Low/basal transcription**.\n\n    - **Conclusion**: The $\\mathrm{lacO}^{\\mathrm{c}}$ mutation renders transcription independent of the inducer. The level of expression, however, remains dependent on glucose concentration via the $ \\mathrm{CRP}\\cdot \\mathrm{cAMP} $ system. Expression is high only when glucose is low.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. $\\mathrm{lacO}^{\\mathrm{c}}$ is a cis-acting operator sequence mutation that abolishes $ \\mathrm{LacI} $ binding.

It correctly states that transcription is independent of inducer and modulated by $ \\mathrm{CRP}\\cdot \\mathrm{cAMP} $ (i.e., by glucose levels), resulting in high expression at low glucose and low expression at high glucose.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. $\\mathrm{lacO}^{\\mathrm{c}}$ is a trans-acting mutation in $\\mathrm{lacI}$ that prevents the repressor from binding DNA, producing constitutive high expression in all conditions, independent of $ \\mathrm{CRP}\\cdot \\mathrm{cAMP} $ and inducer.**\n- **Molecular Definition**: Incorrect. The mutation is specified as $\\mathrm{lacO}^{\\mathrm{c}}$, which is in the operator ($O$), not the repressor gene ($I$). A mutation in $\\mathrm{lacO}$ is cis-acting, not trans-acting.\n- **Predicted Phenotype**: Incorrect. It claims expression is independent of $ \\mathrm{CRP}\\cdot \\mathrm{cAMP} $, which contradicts the fact that the $ P_{lac} $ promoter requires activation for high-level expression.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $\\mathrm{lacO}^{\\mathrm{c}}$ is a cis-acting change that increases $ \\mathrm{LacI} $ affinity for the operator, generating a super-repressed state with no transcription unless inducer is present; $ \\mathrm{CRP}\\cdot \\mathrm{cAMP} $ has minimal effect.**\n- **Molecular Definition**: Incorrect. This describes a super-repressor operator mutation ($O^s$), which is the opposite of a constitutive mutation ($O^c$). Constitutive means \"always on\" (or at least, un-repressible), not \"always off\".\n- **Predicted Phenotype**: Incorrect. A super-repressed state is the antithesis of the phenotype conferred by an $\\mathrm{lacO}^{\\mathrm{c}}$ mutation.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $\\mathrm{lacO}^{\\mathrm{c}}$ disrupts the $ \\mathrm{CRP} $ binding site upstream of the promoter, preventing activation, so expression is low under all conditions even with inducer.**\n- **Molecular Definition**: Incorrect. It confuses the operator ($\\mathrm{lacO}$) with the $ \\mathrm{CRP} $ binding site (also known as the catabolite activator protein, or CAP, site). These are distinct DNA sequences with different functions. The mutation is specified as $\\mathrm{lacO}^{\\mathrm{c}}$.\n- **Predicted Phenotype**: Incorrect. This describes the phenotype for a mutation in the $ \\mathrm{CRP} $ binding site, not the operator.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. $\\mathrm{lacO}^{\\mathrm{c}}$ is a cis-acting operator mutation that abolishes $ \\mathrm{LacI} $ binding, and because the operator is unoccupied, RNAP no longer requires $ \\mathrm{CRP}\\cdot \\mathrm{cAMP} $, yielding high expression in all conditions regardless of glucose or inducer.**\n- **Molecular Definition**: The first part, \"$\\mathrm{lacO}^{\\mathrm{c}}$ is a cis-acting operator mutation that abolishes $ \\mathrm{LacI} $ binding\", is correct.\n- **Predicted Phenotype**: The second part is fundamentally incorrect. The removal of a repressor does not bypass the requirement for an activator. The $ \\mathrm{LacI} $ and $ \\mathrm{CRP}\\cdot \\mathrm{cAMP} $ systems are independent inputs. The $ P_{lac} $ promoter is weak and still requires activation by $ \\mathrm{CRP}\\cdot \\mathrm{cAMP} $ to achieve high-level transcription. Expression will therefore remain low when glucose is high.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2599304"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the equilibrium-based models often used for the *lac* operon, bacteria have evolved sophisticated kinetic control mechanisms.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in molecular biology, requiring a quantitative analysis of the timing of coupled transcription and translation.

The reference point for time, $t=0$, is the moment the start codon of the leader peptide transcript becomes available.\n\nFirst, we calculate the time required for the ribosome to travel the distance $L_{2}$.
