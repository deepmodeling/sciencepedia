You may assume that a sequencing read samples a single molecule uniformly at random from this population.\n\nUse the following well-established biochemical principles as the foundational base:\n- Sodium bisulfite deaminates unmodified cytosine and the oxidized derivatives 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) to uracil, which is read as thymine in sequencing; 5mC resists deamination under standard bisulfite conditions. In conventional bisulfite sequencing, 5hmC forms a stable sulfonated adduct that is also read as cytosine and thus is not distinguished from 5mC.\n- In oxBS-seq, a selective chemical oxidation step converts 5hmC to 5fC/5caC prior to bisulfite treatment, whereas 5mC is not intended to be oxidized. Thus, ideally, 5hmC is read as thymine after bisulfite, while 5mC remains as cytosine.\n- In TAB-seq, 5hmC is first protected by glucosylation to glucosyl-5hmC, after which Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes oxidize 5mC to 5caC. Bisulfite then converts unmodified cytosine and 5caC to uracil (thymine in reads), while glucosyl-5hmC remains as cytosine.
