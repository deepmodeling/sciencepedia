A key question in genomics is distinguishing these functional signals from the vast background of non-functional DNA.

It is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed to the solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the expected total number of occurrences, $E[C_{\\text{total}}]$. The total count is the sum of counts on the forward and reverse strands:\n$$C_{\\text{total}} = C_{\\text{fwd}} + C_{\\text{rev}}$$\nwhere $C_{\\text{fwd}}$ is the number of matches to $M = \\mathrm{TATAWA}$ on the forward strand, and $C_{\\text{rev}}$ is the number of matches to the reverse complement of $M$ on the reverse strand.\n\nBy the linearity of expectation, the total expected count is the sum of the individual expected counts:\n$$E[C_{\\text{total}}] = E[C_{\\text{fwd}}] + E[C_{\\text{rev}}]$$\nThis property holds regardless of any statistical dependence between the counts, such as from overlapping windows.\n\nFirst, we calculate the probability of the motif $M = \\mathrm{TATAWA}$ occurring at any given position. The length of the motif is $k=6$. The probability of $\\mathrm{W}$ is the sum of the probabilities of the bases it represents:\n$$P(\\mathrm{W}) = P(\\mathrm{A}) + P(\\mathrm{T}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nDue to the independence of nucleotides in the model, the probability of the motif $M$ is the product of the probabilities of its constituent bases:\n$$P(M) = P(\\mathrm{T}) \\times P(\\mathrm{A}) \\times P(\\mathrm{T}) \\times P(\\mathrm{A}) \\times P(\\mathrm{W}) \\times P(\\mathrm{A})$$\n$$P(M) = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{5} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{1024} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2048}$$\n\nNext, we consider the occurrences on the forward strand of length $L=1000$. A $k=6$ motif can start at any position from $i=1$ to $i = L-k+1$. The number of possible starting positions (windows) is:\n$$N = L - k + 1 = 1000 - 6 + 1 = 995$$\nLet $X_i$ be the indicator random variable such that $X_i=1$ if the motif $M$ starts at position $i$ on the forward strand, and $X_i=0$ otherwise. The expected value of $X_i$ is the probability of the event it indicates:\n$$E[X_i] = P(\\text{motif } M \\text{ starts at } i) = P(M) = \\frac{1}{2048}$$\nThe total count on the forward strand is $C_{\\text{fwd}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$. Using the linearity of expectation:\n$$E[C_{\\text{fwd}}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i] = N \\times P(M) = 995 \\times \\frac{1}{2048}$$\n\nNow, we consider the reverse strand. The task is to count occurrences of the reverse complement of $M$, denoted $M'$. The complement of $\\mathrm{TATAWA}$ is $\\mathrm{ATATWT}$ (since the complement of $\\mathrm{A}$ is $\\mathrm{T}$, $\\mathrm{T}$ is $\\mathrm{A}$, and $\\mathrm{W}$ is $\\mathrm{W}$). The reverse of $\\mathrm{ATATWT}$ is $\\mathrm{TWTATA}$. So, $M' = \\mathrm{TWTATA}$.\n\nThe problem formulation considers a double-stranded DNA molecule. The sequence of the reverse strand, when read in its 5'-to-3' direction, is itself a random sequence. The specified background model is symmetric with respect to complementation, i.e., $P(\\mathrm{A})=P(\\mathrm{T})$ and $P(\\mathrm{C})=P(\\mathrm{G})$. Consequently, a randomly generated sequence and its reverse complement have identical statistical properties. Therefore, the expected number of occurrences of any motif $M'$ on a random sequence of length $L$ is given by the same formula as for $M$.\nThe probability of $M' = \\mathrm{TWTATA}$ is:\n$$P(M') = P(\\mathrm{T}) \\times P(\\mathrm{W}) \\times P(\\mathrm{T}) \\times P(\\mathrm{A}) \\times P(\\mathrm{T}) \\times P(\\mathrm{A})$$\n$$P(M') = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{5} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2048}$$\nThe expected number of occurrences of $M'$ on the reverse strand (of length $L=1000$) is:\n$$E[C_{\\text{rev}}] = N \\times P(M') = 995 \\times \\frac{1}{2048}$$\nThe total expected count is the sum of the expectations for both strands.\n$$E[C_{\\text{total}}] = E[C_{\\text{fwd}}] + E[C_{\\text{rev}}] = \\left(995 \\times \\frac{1}{2048}\\right) + \\left(995 \\times \\frac{1}{2048}\\right)$$\n$$E[C_{\\text{total}}] = 2 \\times 995 \\times \\frac{1}{2048} = \\frac{1990}{2048} = \\frac{995}{1024}$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate this expression numerically and round to three significant figures.\n$$E[C_{\\text{total}}] = \\frac{995}{1024} \\approx 0.9716796875$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $0.972$.\n\nThis result implies that under a simple random sequence model, one expects to find approximately one perfect TATA-box consensus sequence in every kilobase of double-stranded DNA. This highlights the significant challenge of signal-to-noise ratio in bioinformatics. A simple match to a short consensus motif is insufficient to identify a functional biological element, as such sequences occur frequently by chance.

A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental thermodynamic relationship between the standard Gibbs free energy change of a process, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$, and its equilibrium constant. For the binding of a protein ($P$) to DNA ($D$), we consider the dissociation equilibrium:\n$$ PD \\rightleftharpoons P + D $$\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation process is the dissociation constant, $K_d$, defined as:\n$$ K_{d} = \\frac{[P][D]}{[PD]} $$\nThe standard free energy change for this dissociation reaction, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{dissoc}}$, is related to $K_d$ by the equation:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{dissoc}} = -RT \\ln(K_d) $$\nIt is a common convention in biochemistry to report the standard \"binding free energy\", which corresponds to the association reaction ($P+D \\rightleftharpoons PD$). The free energy for association, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{assoc}}$, is the negative of the free energy for dissociation: $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{assoc}} = -\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{dissoc}}$. Therefore, the standard binding free energy $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ (referring to association) is related to the dissociation constant $K_d$ as follows:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ} = - \\left( -RT \\ln(K_d) \\right) = RT \\ln(K_d) $$\nThis equation forms the basis of our calculation. A more positive (or less negative) $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ signifies weaker binding, which corresponds to a larger value of $K_d$ (greater dissociation).\n\nWe apply this relationship to both the consensus (cons) and mutant (mut) DNA sequences:\nFor the consensus sequence:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{cons}} = RT \\ln(K_{d,\\mathrm{cons}}) $$\nFor the mutant sequence:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{mut}} = RT \\ln(K_{d,\\mathrm{mut}}) $$\nThe problem provides the increment in the standard binding free energy due to the mutation, which we denote as $\\Delta(\\Delta G^{\\circ})$. This is the difference between the mutant and consensus free energies:\n$$ \\Delta(\\Delta G^{\\circ}) = \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{mut}} - \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{cons}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the free energies into this difference equation yields:\n$$ \\Delta(\\Delta G^{\\circ}) = RT \\ln(K_{d,\\mathrm{mut}}) - RT \\ln(K_{d,\\mathrm{cons}}) $$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we combine the terms:\n$$ \\Delta(\\Delta G^{\\circ}) = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_{d,\\mathrm{mut}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{cons}}}\\right) $$\nThe problem requires the calculation of the fold change in the dissociation constant, which is precisely the ratio $\\frac{K_{d,\\mathrm{mut}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{cons}}}$. We rearrange the equation to solve for this ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta(\\Delta G^{\\circ})}{RT} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_{d,\\mathrm{mut}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{cons}}}\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{K_{d,\\mathrm{mut}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{cons}}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta(\\Delta G^{\\circ})}{RT}\\right) $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression. First, we compute the product $RT$, which represents the thermal energy scale:\n$$ RT = (1.987 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ kcal mol}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}) \\times (298 \\text{ K}) \\approx 0.592126 \\text{ kcal mol}^{-1} $$\nNext, we compute the dimensionless exponent:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta(\\Delta G^{\\circ})}{RT} = \\frac{1.5 \\text{ kcal mol}^{-1}}{0.592126 \\text{ kcal mol}^{-1}} \\approx 2.5332 $$\nFinally, we compute the exponential to find the fold change:\n$$ \\frac{K_{d,\\mathrm{mut}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{cons}}} = \\exp(2.5332) \\approx 12.5934 $$\nThe positive sign of $\\Delta(\\Delta G^{\\circ})$ indicates that the mutation destabilizes the TFIIB-DNA complex, making binding less favorable.
