It is a standard calculation in molecular biophysics. A rigorous solution will be provided.\n\nThe task is to compute the superhelical density, $\\sigma$, of a closed circular DNA molecule after the assembly of a specific number of nucleosomes. The definition of superhelical density is provided as $\\sigma = \\Delta Lk / Lk_{0}$, where $\\Delta Lk$ is the change in the linking number from its relaxed state, and $Lk_{0}$ is the linking number of the relaxed molecule.\n\nFirst, we determine the linking number of the relaxed plasmid, $Lk_{0}$. This is defined as the total number of base pairs, $N$, divided by the helical repeat, $h$, which is the number of base pairs per turn of the DNA double helix.\nGiven:\n- Total number of base pairs, $N = 3000$ bp.\n- Helical repeat, $h = 10.5$ bp/turn.\n\nThe relaxed linking number is therefore:\n$$Lk_{0} = \\frac{N}{h} = \\frac{3000}{10.5}$$\n\nNext, we must determine the total change in the linking number, $\\Delta Lk$.

The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe nucleosome repeat length (NRL) represents the average length of DNA associated with a single nucleosome unit in chromatin. This length is the sum of the DNA wrapped around the histone core and the linker DNA that connects to the next nucleosome. The measured NRL from an MNase digestion experiment reflects the average spacing between cleavage sites.\n\nAccording to the problem, the binding of histone H1 occludes an additional length of DNA, $f$, from MNase cleavage. The overall measured NRL is therefore a population average, dependent on the fraction of nucleosomes that have H1 bound. Let $p$ be the fractional occupancy of H1 on its nucleosomal binding site. A fraction $p$ of nucleosomes will have an increased protected length, while the remaining fraction $1-p$ will not.\n\nWe can construct a linear model for the NRL as a function of H1 occupancy. Let $\\text{NRL}(p)$ be the NRL for a given fractional occupancy $p$. Let $\\text{NRL}_{\\text{dep}}$ be the NRL in the complete absence of H1, corresponding to the depleted condition where $p=0$. The presence of H1 adds an average length of $p \\cdot f$ to the repeating unit.\nThus, the model is:\n$$ \\text{NRL}(p) = \\text{NRL}_{\\text{dep}} + p \\cdot f $$\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $p$, is governed by the Langmuir binding isotherm for a single binding site:\n$$ p = \\frac{[\\mathrm{H1}]}{K_d + [\\mathrm{H1}]} $$\nwhere $[\\mathrm{H1}]$ is the free concentration of histone H1 and $K_d$ is the dissociation constant.\n\nWe must first calculate the fractional occupancy in the control condition, $p_{\\text{ctl}}$.\nGiven $[\\mathrm{H1}]_{\\text{ctl}} = 50 \\text{ nM}$ and $K_d = 10 \\text{ nM}$:\n$$ p_{\\text{ctl}} = \\frac{50}{10 + 50} = \\frac{50}{60} = \\frac{5}{6} $$\n\nFor the control condition, the NRL is given as $\\text{NRL}_{\\text{ctl}} = 197 \\text{ bp}$.

The fractional occupancy, $p_{\\text{dep}}$, is therefore:\n$$ p_{\\text{dep}} = \\frac{0}{10 + 0} = 0 $$\nThe NRL in the depleted condition is thus:\n$$ \\text{NRL}_{\\text{dep}} = \\text{NRL}_{\\text{dep}} + (0) \\cdot f = \\text{NRL}_{\\text{dep}} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the expected decrease in NRL upon H1 depletion. This quantity is $\\Delta \\text{NRL} = \\text{NRL}_{\\text{ctl}} - \\text{NRL}_{\\text{dep}}$.\nFrom the equation for the control condition, we can rearrange to find this difference directly:\n$$ \\text{NRL}_{\\text{ctl}} - \\text{NRL}_{\\text{dep}} = p_{\\text{ctl}} \\cdot f $$\n\nNow, we substitute the known values into this expression.
