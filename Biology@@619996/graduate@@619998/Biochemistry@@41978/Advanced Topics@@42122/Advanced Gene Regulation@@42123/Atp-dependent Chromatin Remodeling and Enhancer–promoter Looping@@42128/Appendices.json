It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It describes a simplified, but physically and biologically plausible, scenario of chromatin loop extrusion by a cohesin complex. The core task is to apply the fundamental definition of constant velocity to solve a simple kinematics problem.\n\nWe begin with the definition of velocity, $v$, as the time rate of change of a length variable, which we denote as $l$. The length $l(t)$ represents the total length of the DNA loop that has been extruded at time $t$. The problem states that the extrusion rate, or velocity, is constant. Mathematically, this is expressed as a first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\nv = \\frac{dl}{dt}\n$$\nTo find the total time, $T$, required to form a loop of a specific length, $L$, we must solve this differential equation. We can rearrange the equation to separate the variables $l$ and $t$:\n$$\ndl = v \\, dt\n$$\nNext, we integrate both sides of the equation. The integration for the length variable $l$ is from the initial length, which is $0$ at time $t=0$, to the final length, $L$. The integration for the time variable $t$ is from the start time, $t=0$, to the final time, $T$.\n$$\n\\int_{l=0}^{l=L} dl = \\int_{t=0}^{t=T} v \\, dt\n$$\nBecause the velocity $v$ is a constant as stipulated by the problem statement, it can be taken out of the integral on the right-hand side:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} dl = v \\int_{0}^{T} dt\n$$\nEvaluating the definite integrals gives:\n$$\n[l]_{0}^{L} = v [t]_{0}^{T}\n$$\n$$\nL - 0 = v(T - 0)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the well-known relationship for constant velocity motion:\n$$\nL = vT\n$$\nSolving for the time $T$ yields the general expression for the time required to extrude a loop of length $L$ at a constant velocity $v$:\n$$\nT = \\frac{L}{v}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression requested by the problem.\n\nNow, we must evaluate this expression for the given values.

The model, though simplified, represents a valid biophysical abstraction of chromatin remodeling, a known cellular process. The use of Bernoulli trials to model stochastic events with a fixed probability of success is a standard and appropriate method in statistical mechanics and biophysics. The parameters are physically plausible for a simplified model.

The problem is complete, consistent, and does not violate any fundamental principles of mathematics or science.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem describes a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials. Each trial corresponds to one ATP hydrolysis event. A \"success\" is a productive translocation of the nucleosome by $1\\ \\mathrm{bp}$, occurring with probability $p = \\eta = 0.3$. A \"failure\" is a non-productive cycle where no displacement occurs, with probability $1-p = 1-\\eta = 0.7$. The process is to continue until a total displacement of $50\\ \\mathrm{bp}$ is achieved. Since each success results in a $1\\ \\mathrm{bp}$ displacement, this is equivalent to achieving a total of $k=50$ successes. We are asked to find the expected number of trials (ATP molecules hydrolyzed) required to achieve these $k$ successes.\n\nThis is a classic problem concerning the negative binomial distribution, which describes the number of trials required to achieve a fixed number of successes in a series of independent Bernoulli trials. As per the problem's directive, we will derive the expected value from first principles.\n\nLet $T_1$ be the number of trials required to obtain the first success. This random variable follows a geometric distribution. The probability that the first success occurs on the $n$-th trial, $P(T_1 = n)$, is the probability of having $n-1$ failures followed by one success. Given the independence of trials, this is:\n$$ P(T_1=n) = (1-p)^{n-1}p $$\nThe expected value of $T_1$ is given by the sum over all possible values of $n$:\n$$ E[T_1] = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n P(T_1=n) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n p (1-p)^{n-1} $$\nLet $q = 1-p$. The expression becomes $E[T_1] = p \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n q^{n-1}$. The sum is the derivative of a geometric series:\n$$ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n q^{n-1} = \\frac{d}{dq} \\left( \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} q^n \\right) $$\nFor $|q|1$, we know $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} q^n = \\frac{1}{1-q}$.\n$$ \\frac{d}{dq} \\left( \\frac{1}{1-q} \\right) = \\frac{1}{(1-q)^2} $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expectation formula:\n$$ E[T_1] = p \\cdot \\frac{1}{(1-q)^2} = p \\cdot \\frac{1}{(1-(1-p))^2} = p \\cdot \\frac{1}{p^2} = \\frac{1}{p} $$\nSo, the expected number of trials to achieve the first success is $\\frac{1}{p}$.\n\nWe need to achieve $k=50$ successes. Let $N$ be the total number of trials required. We can conceptualize $N$ as the sum of the waiting times for each successive success. Let $T_i$ be the number of trials required to get the $i$-th success after the $(i-1)$-th success has already occurred. Then the total number of trials is:\n$$ N = T_1 + T_2 + \\dots + T_k $$\nBecause the trials are independent, the number of trials needed to get the next success is independent of all previous trials. Thus, the random variables $T_1, T_2, \\dots, T_k$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), each following the same geometric distribution with expected value $E[T_i] = \\frac{1}{p}$.\n\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected total number of trials is the sum of the individual expectations:\n$$ E[N] = E[T_1 + T_2 + \\dots + T_k] = E[T_1] + E[T_2] + \\dots + E[T_k] = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} E[T_i] $$\nSince $E[T_i] = \\frac{1}{p}$ for all $i=1, \\dots, k$, the sum becomes:\n$$ E[N] = k \\cdot \\frac{1}{p} $$\nThis is the general formula for the expected number of trials to achieve $k$ successes.\n\nWe now substitute the specific values from the problem into this derived expression.\nThe required number of successes is $k = 50$.\nThe probability of a success per trial is the coupling efficiency, $p = \\eta = 0.3$.\n\nThe expected number of ATP molecules that must be hydrolyzed is:\n$$ E[N] = \\frac{k}{p} = \\frac{50}{0.3} $$\nTo express this as an exact fraction as required, we write the decimal $0.3$ as the fraction $\\frac{3}{10}$.\n$$ E[N] = \\frac{50}{\\frac{3}{10}} = 50 \\times \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{500}{3} $$\nThis is the expected number of ATP hydrolysis events required to move the nucleosome by $50\\ \\mathrm{bp}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{500}{3}}$$", "id": "2543336"}, {"introduction": "To gain deeper mechanistic insight, biophysicists analyze the kinetics of single enzyme molecules, a powerful approach for dissecting complex reaction pathways.

The use of dwell-time analysis to dissect complex enzymatic cycles is a cornerstone of single-molecule kinetics. The idea that a macroscopic step may hide several sequential, rate-limiting elementary steps is a common model for molecular motors.\n-   **Mathematical Formalism:** The connection between the sum of $n$ independent and identically distributed exponential random variables and the gamma distribution is a fundamental result of probability theory. Specifically, for an integer number of steps $n$, the resulting distribution is an Erlang distribution, which is a special case of the gamma distribution. Let the time for each i.i.d. substep $\\tau_i$ be drawn from an exponential distribution with rate constant $k$, having a probability density function (PDF) of $p(\\tau_i) = k e^{-k \\tau_i}$. The total time for the macroscopic step, $T$, is the sum $T = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\tau_i$. The PDF for $T$ is the convolution of $n$ such exponential distributions, which yields the Erlang distribution:\n    $$P(T; n, k) = \\frac{k^n T^{n-1}}{(n-1)!} e^{-kT}$$\n    This is a gamma distribution with an integer shape parameter $\\alpha=n$ and a rate parameter $\\beta=k$.

It is a well-formulated question in biophysical chemistry. A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the direct relationship between the assumed mechanistic model and the observed statistical distribution. The problem explicitly provides the model: a macroscopic step is composed of $n$ sequential, independent, and identically distributed (i.i.d.) rate-limiting substeps.\n\n1.  **Sequential Process:** A sequential process means the total time is the sum of the times for the individual substeps.\n2.  **Exponential Substeps:** Each substep's duration is memoryless and follows first-order kinetics, meaning its waiting time is an exponential random variable. Let the rate constant for each substep be $k$.\n3.  **Identically Distributed:** \"Identically distributed\" means that all $n$ substeps have the same rate constant $k$.\n4.  **Statistical Result:** As established in the validation, the sum of $n$ i.i.d. exponential waiting times with rate $k$ results in a total waiting time that follows an Erlang distribution, which is a gamma distribution with a shape parameter equal to $n$ and a rate parameter equal to $k$.\n\nThe experimental observation is that the dwell-time data is best fit by a gamma distribution with a shape parameter of $n_{exp}=3$. Given the assumed mechanistic base, we must equate the theoretical parameter $n$ with the experimentally determined parameter $n_{exp}$. This leads to the direct inference that the macroscopic step consists of $3$ sequential, rate-limiting substeps, each having approximately the same rate constant. This specific mechanism is known as an Erlang mechanism.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option based on this deduction.\n\n**A. The macroscopic step comprises $3$ sequential rate-limiting substeps with approximately equal rate constants, consistent with an Erlang-like mechanism.**\nThis statement is a precise and accurate description of the conclusion derived above. The gamma distribution with an integer shape parameter $n=3$ is the signature of a process involving the completion of $3$ sequential steps, each with an exponentially distributed waiting time. The \"identically distributed\" condition from the problem statement implies that the rate constants for these steps are equal. This is the definition of an Erlang process.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. There is a single rate-limiting substep, but its rate constant drifts slowly over time within a trajectory, producing apparent non-exponential dwell times; therefore, no inference about the number of substeps can be made.**\nThis option proposes an alternative model known as dynamic disorder, where the kinetic rate itself is a random variable that changes over time. While dynamic disorder can indeed lead to non-exponential waiting time distributions, the problem statement explicitly forbids this interpretation by asserting that \"No other hidden heterogeneity is present under these conditions.\" This clause is designed to isolate the sequential-step model as the sole framework for interpretation. Therefore, this option contradicts the given premises.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Exactly $3$ molecules of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) are hydrolyzed per macroscopic step.**\nThis is an over-interpretation that is not strictly justified by the kinetic data alone. The model identifies $3$ rate-limiting *kinetic* steps. A kinetic step is a transition between stable or meta-stable states in the reaction coordinate. The hydrolysis of a single ATP molecule is a complex process that may itself involve multiple such steps (e.g., ATP binding, the chemical hydrolysis step, phosphate release, ADP release). It is possible that one ATP hydrolysis event drives the entire $3$-step transition, or that one of the $3$ steps is ATP hydrolysis while the other $2$ are conformational changes. Conversely, it is also possible that each step corresponds to one ATP hydrolysis, but the data does not compel this conclusion. The number of kinetic steps determined from a dwell-time distribution does not, by itself, determine the reaction stoichiometry with respect to a substrate like ATP.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The remodeler chooses among $3$ parallel pathways, each with its own rate-limiting step, and whichever completes first triggers the macroscopic step; this parallel mechanism explains the observed shape parameter.**\nThis describes a parallel reaction scheme. In such a mechanism, the observed process is completed as soon as *any one* of the parallel pathways finishes. Mathematically, if the waiting times for the pathways are $T_1$, $T_2$, and $T_3$, the observed dwell time is $T_{obs} = \\min(T_1, T_2, T_3)$. If each $T_i$ is an exponential random variable with rate $k_i$, the distribution of $T_{obs}$ is also an exponential random variable with a rate equal to the sum of the individual rates, $k_{obs} = k_1 + k_2 + k_3$. This would produce a single-exponential distribution. A sequential process (sum of waiting times) leads to a gamma-shaped distribution, while a parallel process (minimum of waiting times) leads to a single-exponential distribution. The observation of a non-exponential, gamma-shaped distribution with $n=3$ explicitly refutes a parallel mechanism.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2543338"}]}
