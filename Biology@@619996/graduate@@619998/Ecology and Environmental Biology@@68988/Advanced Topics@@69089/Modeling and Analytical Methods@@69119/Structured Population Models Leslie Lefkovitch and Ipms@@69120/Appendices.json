A key result from Perron-Frobenius theory is that for a \"well-behaved\" (primitive) projection matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, any initial population will eventually converge in shape to a unique, stable stage distribution (SSD), denoted by the vector $\\mathbf{w}$. This exercise provides a direct, computational experience of this fundamental process, guiding you to simulate population dynamics and numerically track the convergence of the population's structure towards the SSD using standard distance metrics. [@problem_id:2536698]", "problem": "You are given a set of discrete-time, nonnegative, stage-structured population projection matrices and initial stage-abundance vectors. In each case, the population evolves according to the fundamental recurrence of structured population dynamics, namely $\\mathbf{n}_{t+1} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{n}_t$ for integer time $t \\geq 0$, where $\\mathbf{n}_t$ is the stage-abundance column vector at time $t$ and $\\mathbf{A}$ is a fixed nonnegative projection matrix. For a primitive nonnegative matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, the Perron–Frobenius theorem guarantees a unique positive right eigenvector $\\mathbf{w}$ associated with the dominant eigenvalue, which, when normalized to sum to $1$, is called the stable stage distribution. To quantify how a population starting from an initial abundance vector $\\mathbf{n}_0$ approaches $\\mathbf{w}$, use two metrics computed on normalized stage frequency vectors $\\mathbf{p}_t = \\mathbf{n}_t / \\sum_i n_{t,i}$:\n- Total variation distance defined by $\\mathrm{TV}(\\mathbf{p}_t,\\mathbf{w}) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\sum_i \\lvert p_{t,i} - w_i \\rvert$.\n- Cosine similarity defined by $\\cos(\\theta_t) = \\dfrac{\\mathbf{p}_t^\\top \\mathbf{w}}{\\lVert \\mathbf{p}_t \\rVert_2 \\lVert \\mathbf{w} \\rVert_2}$.\n\nStarting only from these definitions and the recurrence $\\mathbf{n}_{t+1} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{n}_t$, write a program that, for each test case below, performs the following:\n- Compute the stable stage distribution $\\mathbf{w}$ as the $\\ell_1$-normalized limit of repeatedly applying $\\mathbf{A}$ to an arbitrary positive starting vector; that is, iterate $\\mathbf{v}_{k+1} \\propto \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{v}_k$ with $\\sum_i v_{k+1,i} = 1$ until convergence.\n- Simulate the projection $\\mathbf{n}_{t+1} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{n}_t$ forward from the specified $\\mathbf{n}_0$.\n- At each requested time $t$ in the provided list, form $\\mathbf{p}_t = \\mathbf{n}_t / \\sum_i n_{t,i}$ and compute $\\mathrm{TV}(\\mathbf{p}_t,\\mathbf{w})$ and $\\cos(\\theta_t)$.\n\nAll values to be output should be rounded to $6$ decimal places.

Concretely, the output must be a single line with no spaces that looks like\n  $$[[[\\mathrm{TV}_{1,1},\\dots],[\\cos_{1,1},\\dots]],[[\\mathrm{TV}_{2,1},\\dots],[\\cos_{2,1},\\dots]],[[\\mathrm{TV}_{3,1},\\dots],[\\cos_{3,1},\\dots]]],$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{TV}_{i,j}$ and $\\cos_{i,j}$ denote the metric values (rounded to $6$ decimals) for case $i$ at the $j$-th time in $\\mathcal{T}_i$. For example, the line should resemble\n$$[[[0.123456,0.012345,\\dots],[0.987654,0.998765,\\dots]],[[\\dots],[\\dots]],[[\\dots],[\\dots]]].$$", "solution": "The problem requires the analysis of discrete-time structured population models. The dynamics of the population are governed by the linear recurrence relation:\n$$\n\\mathbf{n}_{t+1} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{n}_t\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{n}_t$ is a column vector representing the abundance of individuals in each stage at an integer time $t \\geq 0$, and $\\mathbf{A}$ is a non-negative, time-invariant population projection matrix. The element $a_{ij}$ of $\\mathbf{A}$ represents the per capita contribution of individuals from stage $j$ to stage $i$ in one time step.\n\nA central concept in the analysis of such models is the long-term behavior of the population's structure. For a matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ that is primitive (i.e., irreducible and aperiodic, which is equivalent to $\\mathbf{A}^k$ being a strictly positive matrix for some integer $k \\geq 1$), the Perron-Frobenius theorem provides a powerful result. It guarantees the existence of a unique positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$, called the dominant eigenvalue, which is simple and strictly greater in magnitude than any other eigenvalue. The corresponding right eigenvector, denoted $\\mathbf{w}$, has all positive entries. When this eigenvector is normalized such that its elements sum to $1$ (i.e., $\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|_1 = \\sum_i w_i = 1$), it is termed the stable stage distribution. Any initial population vector $\\mathbf{n}_0$ with at least one non-zero entry corresponding to a reproductive stage will, after a few time steps, converge in structure to this distribution $\\mathbf{w}$. That is, the stage frequency vector $\\mathbf{p}_t = \\mathbf{n}_t / \\sum_i n_{t,i}$ converges to $\\mathbf{w}$ as $t \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe problem demands the computation of this stable stage distribution $\\mathbf{w}$ using the power iteration method, which is a direct numerical consequence of the dominance of $\\lambda_1$. Starting with an arbitrary positive vector $\\mathbf{v}_0$, the sequence defined by\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_{k+1} = \\frac{\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{v}_k}{\\|\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{v}_k\\|_1}\n$$\nconverges to the stable stage distribution $\\mathbf{w}$. The normalization at each step prevents the vector's magnitude from growing uncontrollably while preserving the direction towards the dominant eigenvector.\n\nOnce $\\mathbf{w}$ is determined, the next step is to simulate the population's trajectory from a given initial state $\\mathbf{n}_0$. This is achieved by repeatedly applying the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ according to the fundamental recurrence $\\mathbf{n}_{t} = \\mathbf{A}^t \\mathbf{n}_0$.\n\nAt specified time points $t$ from the sets $\\mathcal{T}_i$, we must quantify the \"distance\" between the population's current structure, $\\mathbf{p}_t$, and the asymptotic stable structure, $\\mathbf{w}$. Two metrics are prescribed:\n\n$1$. Total Variation Distance: This is a standard metric for comparing probability distributions. It is defined as\n$$\n\\mathrm{TV}(\\mathbf{p}_t, \\mathbf{w}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_i |p_{t,i} - w_i|\n$$\nThis value ranges from $0$ (for identical distributions) to $1$ (for non-overlapping distributions).\n\n$2$. Cosine Similarity: This metric measures the cosine of the angle between the two vectors in a multi-dimensional Euclidean space. It is calculated as the normalized dot product:\n$$\n\\cos(\\theta_t) = \\frac{\\mathbf{p}_t^\\top \\mathbf{w}}{\\|\\mathbf{p}_t\\|_2 \\|\\mathbf{w}\\|_2}\n$$\nwhere $\\|\\cdot\\|_2$ denotes the Euclidean ($\\ell_2$) norm. A value of $1$ indicates that the vectors point in the same direction, signifying identical population structure, while lower values indicate divergence.\n\nThe overall algorithm to satisfy the problem's requirements is as follows:\n$1$. For each provided test case $(\\mathbf{A}_i, \\mathbf{n}_{0,i}, \\mathcal{T}_i)$:\n    a. Implement the power iteration method to compute the stable stage distribution $\\mathbf{w}_i$ for the matrix $\\mathbf{A}_i$. An initial vector of ones is a suitable choice for $\\mathbf{v}_0$. The iteration continues until the change between successive vectors is below a small tolerance (e.g., $10^{-12}$ in the $\\ell_1$ norm).\n    b. Initialize the population vector $\\mathbf{n}_t = \\mathbf{n}_{0,i}$.\n    c. Iterate from time $t=1$ to the maximum time required in $\\mathcal{T}_i$. In each step, calculate $\\mathbf{n}_{t+1} = \\mathbf{A}_i \\mathbf{n}_t$.\n    d. If the current time $t$ is in the list of specified times $\\mathcal{T}_i$, compute the stage frequency vector $\\mathbf{p}_t = \\mathbf{n}_t / \\sum_j n_{t,j}$. Then, calculate $\\mathrm{TV}(\\mathbf{p}_t, \\mathbf{w}_i)$ and $\\cos(\\theta_t)$ using the formulas above.\n    e. Store the computed metric values, rounded to $6$ decimal places.\n\n$2$. Assemble the results from all test cases into a single nested list structure as specified by the output format.  This involves creating pairs of lists (one for total variation distances, one for cosine similarities) for each case, and then nesting these pairs within an outer list.\n\n$3$. Convert the final data structure into a compact string representation with no extraneous spaces and print it as a single line. This strict formatting is achieved by building the string representation of the nested lists and ensuring floating-point numbers are formatted to the required precision.\n\nThis procedure is deterministic and directly implements the specified mathematical definitions and algorithms, ensuring a correct and verifiable solution.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the structured population dynamics problem for the given test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def compute_stable_stage_distribution(A, tol=1e-12, max_iter=2000):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the stable stage distribution (w) for a primitive matrix A\n        using the power iteration method.\n        \"\"\"\n        n = A.shape[0]\n        # Start with a uniform positive vector (l1-normalized)\n        v = np.ones(n) / n\n        for _ in range(max_iter):\n            Av = A @ v\n            # If the population dies out, there's no distribution.\n            # Problem assumes this doesn't happen.\n            norm_Av = np.sum(Av)\n            if norm_Av == 0:\n                # Return a zero vector if population crashes, though this\n                # case is excluded by the problem statement assumptions.\n                return np.zeros(n)\n            \n            v_new = Av / norm_Av\n            \n            # Check for convergence using the l1 norm of the difference\n            if np.sum(np.abs(v_new - v)) < tol:\n                return v_new\n            v = v_new\n        \n        # Return the last computed vector if max_iter is reached\n        return v\n\n    def format_list(data):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively formats a nested list of floats into the required string format\n        with no spaces and 6 decimal places for floats.\n        \"\"\"\n        if isinstance(data, list):\n            return f\"[{','.join(format_list(item) for item in data)}]\"\n        elif isinstance(data, (float, np.floating)):\n            return f\"{data:.6f}\"\n        else:\n            return repr(data)\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"A\": np.array([\n                [0, 1.1, 1.8],\n                [0.5, 0, 0],\n                [0, 0.7, 0]\n            ]),\n            \"n0\": np.array([0, 0, 10000]),\n            \"T\": [1, 2, 5, 10, 20]\n        },\n        {\n            \"A\": np.array([\n                [0, 0, 1.2, 2.0],\n                [0.3, 0.3, 0, 0],\n                [0, 0.6, 0.3, 0],\n                [0, 0, 0.5, 0.8]\n            ]),\n            \"n0\": np.array([10000, 0, 0, 0]),\n            \"T\": [1, 2, 5, 10, 20]\n        },\n        {\n            \"A\": np.array([\n                [0, 0.8, 1.0],\n                [0.95, 0.95, 0],\n                [0, 0.04, 0.95]\n            ]),\n            \"n0\": np.array([0, 10000, 0]),\n            \"T\": [1, 2, 5, 10, 20]\n        }\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        A = case[\"A\"]\n        n0 = case[\"n0\"].astype(float)\n        T_list = case[\"T\"]\n\n        # 1.

The quantity of newborns produced at time step $k+1$ by the cohort that was of size and structure $P^k n_0$ at time $k$ is given by $F(P^k n_0)$.\n\nThe total number of newborns produced by the initial cohort $n_0$ over its entire lifetime is the sum of newborns produced at all future time steps:\n$$\n\\text{Total Newborns} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (\\text{Newborns produced at time step } k+1)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Total Newborns} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} F(P^k n_0) = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} F P^k \\right) n_0\n$$\nBy the distributive property of matrix multiplication, this is equivalent to:\n$$\n\\text{Total Newborns} = F \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} P^k \\right) n_0\n$$\nFrom this expression, we identify the net reproductive operator $N$ as the transformation applied to the initial newborn cohort $n_0$:\n$$\nN = F \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} P^k\n$$\nThis is the expression for $N$ as an infinite series.\n\nFor this series to be meaningful, the geometric matrix series $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} P^k$ must converge. In a finite-dimensional vector space, this series converges if and only if the spectral radius of the matrix $P$, denoted $\\rho(P)$, is strictly less than $1$. That is, the precise condition for convergence is $\\rho(P) < 1$. Biologically, this condition means that any cohort of individuals must eventually go extinct in the absence of reproduction, which is a requirement for a stable population structure where lifetime reproductive output is finite.\n\nTo justify convergence, we invoke a standard result from matrix analysis. Gelfand's formula states that for any matrix norm $\\|\\cdot\\|$, the spectral radius is given by $\\rho(P) = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\|P^k\\|^{1/k}$. If $\\rho(P) < 1$, we can choose a real number $r$ such that $\\rho(P) < r < 1$. It is a known theorem that for any such $r$, there exists a consistent matrix norm (an operator norm induced by a vector norm) such that $\\|P\\| \\le r$. Using this norm, the terms of the series can be bounded:\n$$\n\\|P^k\\| \\le \\|P\\|^k \\le r^k\n$$\nSince $0 \\le r < 1$, the geometric series of real numbers $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} r^k$ converges to $1/(1-r)$. By the matrix analogue of the Weierstrass M-test (comparison test), the matrix series $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} P^k$ converges absolutely. The sum of this convergent series is the matrix $(I-P)^{-1}$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n\nThus, under the condition $\\rho(P) < 1$, the net reproductive operator is given by the closed-form expression:\n$$\nN = F(I-P)^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem states that $F$ and $P$ are non-negative matrices. Consequently, each term $P^k$ in the series is also non-negative. The partial sums $S_m = \\sum_{k=0}^{m} P^k$ form a sequence of non-negative matrices whose entries are non-decreasing with $m$. If this sequence converges, its limit, $S = (I-P)^{-1}$, must also be a non-negative matrix. Since $N$ is the product of two non-negative matrices, $F$ and $S$, it follows that $N$ itself is a well-defined non-negative matrix.\n\n**Task 2: The Basic Reproduction Number $R_0$**\n\nThe basic reproduction number, $R_0$, is defined as the expected number of new offspring produced by a typical individual over its entire lifetime in a population at demographic equilibrium. In our matrix context, this translates to the long-term, per-generation growth factor of the newborn population.\n\nLet $v_k$ be the vector representing the distribution of newborns in generation $k$. The operator $N$ maps the newborn distribution of one generation to the newborn distribution of the next generation. Thus, we have the generational recursion:\n$$\nv_{k+1} = N v_k\n$$\nThis is a standard discrete-time linear dynamical system. Its long-term behavior is governed by the eigenvalues of the matrix $N$. Specifically, the asymptotic growth rate of the system is determined by the dominant eigenvalue of $N$, which is its spectral radius, $\\rho(N)$. This dominant eigenvalue is, by definition, the basic reproduction number $R_0$.\n$$\nR_0 = \\rho(N)\n$$\nTo prove the properties of $R_0$, we assume that the reproductive process is \"irreducible.\" In the context of the next-generation matrix $N$, this means that $N$ is an irreducible matrix. A non-negative square matrix $M$ is irreducible if for every pair of indices $(i, j)$, there exists an integer $k \\ge 1$ such that the $(i, j)$-th entry of $M^k$ is strictly positive. Biologically, this means that a newborn of any stage can, through some sequence of descendants, ultimately contribute to the production of newborns of any other stage.\n\nSince $N$ is a non-negative matrix, we can apply the Perron-Frobenius theorem. The theorem for irreducible non-negative matrices states:\n1. The spectral radius $\\rho(N)$ is a simple, positive eigenvalue.\n2. This eigenvalue, $R_0 = \\rho(N)$, is strictly greater than the magnitude of any other eigenvalue.\n3. There exists a right eigenvector $w$ corresponding to $R_0$ whose components are all strictly positive. This eigenvector is unique up to scalar multiplication.\n4. There also exists a unique (up to scaling) positive left eigenvector.\n\nTherefore, under the assumption of irreducibility, $R_0$ is the simple, positive, and dominant eigenvalue of $N$. The positivity, $R_0>0$, is guaranteed for any biologically relevant system where reproduction is possible (i.e., $F$ is not the zero matrix and offspring can be produced from some initial state). The uniqueness and positivity of the corresponding right eigenvector $w$ (where $N w = R_0 w$) are also guaranteed.\n\nBiologically, this eigenpair $(R_0, w)$ has a critical interpretation:\n- $R_0$: The basic reproduction number. If $R_0 > 1$, each generation of newborns is larger than the last, and the population will grow. If $R_0 < 1$, each generation is smaller, and the population will decline towards extinction. If $R_0 = 1$, the newborn population replaces itself exactly each generation, leading to demographic stability at the threshold.\n- $w$: The stable stage distribution of newborns. It represents the relative proportions of newborns in different stages that will be maintained from one generation to the next. If an initial cohort of newborns is proportional to $w$, the cohort of their direct offspring will also be proportional to $w$, scaled by the factor $R_0$.\n\n**Task 3: Numerical Algorithm and Justification**\n\nThe derivation in Task 1 provides a direct method for numerically approximating the operator $N$. We use the series expansion $N = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} F P^k$.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Initialize the approximation of $N$ as a zero matrix: $N_{approx} \\leftarrow \\mathbf{0}$.\n2.  Initialize a matrix to store powers of $P$: $P_{pow} \\leftarrow I$, the identity matrix.\n3.  Iterate for $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ up to a specified maximum number of iterations.\n    a. Calculate the next term in the series: $Term \\leftarrow F \\cdot P_{pow}$.\n    b. Check the stopping criterion: Calculate the Frobenius norm of the term, $\\|Term\\|_F$. If $\\|Term\\|_F$ is less than a prescribed tolerance $\\varepsilon$, terminate the iteration. The Frobenius norm is defined as $\\|M\\|_F = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i,j} |m_{ij}|^2}$.\n    c. Add the term to the sum: $N_{approx} \\leftarrow N_{approx} + Term$.\n    d. Update the power of $P$ for the next iteration: $P_{pow} \\leftarrow P_{pow} \\cdot P$.\n4.  Once the loop terminates, compute the eigenvalues of the resulting matrix $N_{approx}$.\n5.  $R_0$ is the spectral radius of $N_{approx}$, which is the maximum of the absolute values of its computed eigenvalues: $R_0 \\leftarrow \\max(|\\lambda_i|)$ for $\\lambda_i \\in \\text{eig}(N_{approx})$.\n\n**Justification:**\nThe correctness of this algorithm rests on the convergence of the geometric matrix series, which is guaranteed if $\\rho(P) < 1$. When this condition holds, $\\|P^k\\| \\to 0$ as $k \\to \\infty$ for any matrix norm. Consequently, $\\|F P^k\\| \\le \\|F\\| \\|P^k\\| \\to 0$, so the norms of the terms vanish. The algorithm truncates the infinite sum once the contribution of the next term is negligibly small, as measured by its Frobenius norm. This provides a finite and accurate approximation of $N$. The properties established in Task 2 justify computing $R_0$ as the spectral radius of this approximated non-negative matrix $N_{approx}$.\n\nThe rate of convergence is determined by $\\rho(P)$. The error of the truncated series after $M$ terms behaves proportionally to $(\\rho(P))^{M+1}$.\n-   If $\\rho(P)$ is small (e.g., close to $0$), convergence is extremely rapid, requiring few iterations.\n-   If $\\rho(P)$ is close to $1$, convergence is very slow, as $(\\rho(P))^k$ decreases slowly. This necessitates a small tolerance $\\varepsilon$ and a large number of iterations to achieve a given accuracy. The case $P_2$ in the problem is an example of this slow convergence regime.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the structured population model problem for the given test cases.\n\n    This function implements the three tasks described in the problem:\n    1.
