Part 2 requires finding the smallest integer $n$ for $R \\geq 0.95$ when $p = 0.28$. $R$ is interpreted as the conditional probability of at least one detection given species presence.\n\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of probability theory and its application to ecological survey design (environmental DNA). The problem is well-posed, with all necessary information provided and no contradictions present. The language is objective and the parameters ($p=0.28$, $R=0.95$) are realistic for the described scenario. The problem requires a standard, but rigorous, application of fundamental concepts, which is a legitimate scientific task.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem will be solved in two parts as specified.\n\n**Part 1: General Expression for Detection Probability**\n\nLet $D_i$ be the event that a detection occurs in the $i$-th replicate, where $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$.\nAccording to the problem, each replicate is a Bernoulli trial. The probability of success (detection) for a single trial is given as $p$.\n$$P(D_i) = p$$\nThe complementary event, $D_i^c$, is the event of no detection in the $i$-th replicate. The probability of this event follows from the axiom of probability for complements:\n$$P(D_i^c) = 1 - P(D_i) = 1 - p$$\nWe are required to find the probability of at least one detection among the $n$ replicates. Let this event be denoted by $A$. The event $A$ is the union of the individual detection events:\n$$A = D_1 \\cup D_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup D_n$$\nTo find $P(A)$, it is more direct to use the complement rule. The complement of event $A$, denoted $A^c$, is the event that there are *no* detections in any of the $n$ replicates. This is equivalent to the intersection of the individual non-detection events:\n$$A^c = D_1^c \\cap D_2^c \\cap \\dots \\cap D_n^c$$\nThe problem states that the replicates are independent. By the definition of independence for multiple events, the probability of their intersection is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(A^c) = P(D_1^c) \\times P(D_2^c) \\times \\dots \\times P(D_n^c)$$\nSince $P(D_i^c) = 1 - p$ for all $i=1, \\dots, n$, this product becomes:\n$$P(A^c) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(D_i^c) = (1-p)^n$$\nThe probability of event $A$ is found by applying the complement rule:\n$$P(A) = 1 - P(A^c)$$\nSubstituting our expression for $P(A^c)$, we arrive at the general expression for the probability of at least one detection among $n$ independent replicates:\n$$P(\\text{at least one detection}) = 1 - (1-p)^n$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Required Number of Replicates**\n\nThe reliability, $R$, is defined as the probability of at least one detection. We are given the requirement that this reliability must be at least $R = 0.95$, with a per-replicate detection probability of $p = 0.28$. We must find the smallest integer $n$ that satisfies this condition.\n\nThe condition is formulated as an inequality using the expression derived in Part 1:\n$$1 - (1-p)^n \\geq R$$\nSubstituting the given values $p=0.28$ and $R=0.95$:\n$$1 - (1-0.28)^n \\geq 0.95$$\n$$1 - (0.72)^n \\geq 0.95$$\nWe now solve for $n$. First, isolate the term containing $n$:\n$$-(0.72)^n \\geq 0.95 - 1$$\n$$-(0.72)^n \\geq -0.05$$\nMultiply both sides by $-1$. This operation reverses the direction of the inequality:\n$$(0.72)^n \\leq 0.05$$\nTo solve for the exponent $n$, we take the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides. Since the natural logarithm is a monotonically increasing function, the direction of the inequality is preserved.\n$$\\ln\\left((0.72)^n\\right) \\leq \\ln(0.05)$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(x^y) = y \\ln(x)$:\n$$n \\ln(0.72) \\leq \\ln(0.05)$$\nTo isolate $n$, we must divide by $\\ln(0.72)$. We must first ascertain the sign of this term. Since $0 < 0.72 < 1$, its natural logarithm is negative, i.e., $\\ln(0.72) < 0$. Dividing an inequality by a negative number reverses the inequality's direction once more:\n$$n \\geq \\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{\\ln(0.72)}$$\nNow, we evaluate the expression on the right-hand side:\n$$\\ln(0.05) \\approx -2.99573227355$$\n$$\\ln(0.72) \\approx -0.32850406697$$\n$$n \\geq \\frac{-2.99573227355}{-0.32850406697} \\approx 9.119313$$\nThe number of replicates, $n$, must be an integer. The problem asks for the smallest integer $n$ that satisfies this condition. Since $n$ must be greater than or equal to approximately $9.119$, the smallest integer value for $n$ is $10$.\n\nTo verify, we can check the inequality for $n=9$ and $n=10$:\nFor $n=9$: $1 - (0.72)^9 \\approx 1 - 0.05305 \\approx 0.94695$. This is less than $0.95$, so $n=9$ is insufficient.\nFor $n=10$: $1 - (0.72)^{10} \\approx 1 - 0.03820 \\approx 0.96180$. This is greater than $0.95$, so $n=10$ is sufficient.\n\nThus, the smallest integer number of replicates required is $10$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "2488055"}, {"introduction": "While increasing replication enhances detection reliability, field and laboratory resources are always finite. This creates a practical challenge: how do we best allocate a fixed budget?

The problem asks for the probability of at least one detection. It is more direct to first calculate the probability of the complementary event: zero detections in all $r$ replicates.\nThe probability of no detection in a single replicate is $1 - P_{\\text{rep}}(v)$.\n$$\n1 - P_{\\text{rep}}(v) = 1 - s(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda v))\n$$\nSince the $r$ replicates are independent, the probability of zero detections in all $r$ replicates is the product of their individual probabilities of non-detection:\n$$\nP(\\text{zero detections in } r \\text{ replicates}) = (1 - P_{\\text{rep}}(v))^r = \\left(1 - s(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda v))\\right)^r\n$$\nThe probability of at least one detection, which we denote $P(r,v)$, is therefore:\n$$\nP(r,v) = 1 - \\left(1 - s(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda v))\\right)^r\n$$\n\nThe final step for part (a) is to eliminate the volume variable $v$ using the budget constraint, yielding an objective function $P(r)$ that depends only on the number of replicates $r$ and the given parameters.
