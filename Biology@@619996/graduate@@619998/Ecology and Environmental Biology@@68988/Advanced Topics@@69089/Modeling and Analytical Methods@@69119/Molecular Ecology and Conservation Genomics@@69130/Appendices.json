Let $p_i$ denote the allele frequency in deme $i$, and let $\\bar{p}$ denote the metapopulation mean frequency, which remains approximately constant over time at the scale considered.

It is a standard problem in theoretical population genetics, based on the foundational Wright-Fisher model and the infinite-island model of migration.

The derivation proceeds from the dynamics of allele frequencies over one generation.\n\nLet $p_{i,t}$ be the frequency of an allele in deme $i$ at generation $t$. The metapopulation average frequency is $\\bar{p}$, which is constant under the assumption of symmetric migration and no selection or mutation on a global scale. The among-deme variance in allele frequency at generation $t$ is $V_t = \\mathrm{Var}(p_t) = \\mathrm{E}[(p_{i,t} - \\bar{p})^2]$, where the expectation is over all demes.\n\nOne generation cycle consists of two sequential processes: migration followed by genetic drift.\n\n1.  **Migration**: After migration, the allele frequency in deme $i$, denoted $p'_{i,t}$, is a convex combination of the local frequency and the metapopulation mean frequency:\n    $$p'_{i,t} = (1-m)p_{i,t} + m\\bar{p}$$\n    where $m$ is the migration rate.\n\n2.  **Genetic Drift**: The new generation is formed by random sampling of $2N_e$ gametes from the post-migration gene pool of each deme. This is the Wright-Fisher sampling process. For a given $p'_{i,t}$, the allele frequency in the next generation, $p_{i,t+1}$, is a random variable with conditional expectation and variance:\n    $$\\mathrm{E}[p_{i,t+1} | p'_{i,t}] = p'_{i,t}$$\n    $$\\mathrm{Var}(p_{i,t+1} | p'_{i,t}) = \\frac{p'_{i,t}(1-p'_{i,t})}{2N_e}$$\n\nWe need to find the recursion for the among-deme variance, $V_{t+1} = \\mathrm{Var}(p_{t+1})$.

Theoretical Relationship for the Slope $S$**\nThe problem describes a state of isolation by distance (IBD) in a two-dimensional, continuous population. Classical population genetics theory, based on the diffusion of ancestral lineages, predicts that for intermediate spatial scales, the genetic distance measure $a(r) = F_{\\mathrm{ST}}(r)/(1 - F_{\\mathrm{ST}}(r))$ is approximately a linear function of the natural logarithm of geographic distance ($\\ln r$).

In one generation, an offspring moves to one of the four adjacent demes with probability $m/4$ each, or remains in its natal deme. The axial variance, $\\sigma^2$, is the mean squared displacement along one axis (e.g., the x-axis) per generation.\nThe possible displacements along the x-axis, $\\Delta x$, are $+\\delta$, $-\\delta$, and $0$.\n- The probability of moving to the right is $P(\\Delta x = +\\delta) = m/4$.\n- The probability of moving to the left is $P(\\Delta x = -\\delta) = m/4$.\n- The probability of zero displacement along the x-axis occurs if the offspring stays put ($1-m$) or moves along the y-axis ($m/4 + m/4 = m/2$). Thus, $P(\\Delta x = 0) = (1-m) + m/2 = 1 - m/2$.\nThe mean axial displacement $\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta x]$ is zero due to symmetry. Therefore, the variance is the expectation of the squared displacement:\n$$\\sigma^2 = \\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta x)^2] = (+\\delta)^2 P(\\Delta x = +\\delta) + (-\\delta)^2 P(\\Delta x = -\\delta) + (0)^2 P(\\Delta x = 0)$$\n$$\\sigma^2 = \\delta^2 \\left(\\frac{m}{4}\\right) + \\delta^2 \\left(\\frac{m}{4}\\right) + 0 = \\frac{2m\\delta^2}{4}$$\n$$\\sigma^2 = \\frac{m\\delta^2}{2}$$\n\n**3.
