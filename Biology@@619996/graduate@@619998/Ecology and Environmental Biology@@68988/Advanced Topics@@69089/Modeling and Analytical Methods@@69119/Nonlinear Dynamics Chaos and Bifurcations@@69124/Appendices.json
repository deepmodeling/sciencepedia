It is scientifically grounded in the established theory of nonlinear dynamics and population ecology, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and formulated with objective, formal language. It is a standard, fundamental problem in the study of one-dimensional discrete maps. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system is described by the logistic map, a function $f: [0,1] \\to [0,1]$ defined as:\n$$x_{t+1} = f(x_t) = r x_t (1 - x_t)$$\nwhere $x_t$ is the normalized population density at time $t$, and $r$ is the growth parameter, with $0 < r \\leq 4$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the fixed points, denoted by $x^*$, of this map. A fixed point is a state of the system that does not change over time, meaning $x_{t+1} = x_t = x^*$. The condition for a fixed point is thus:\n$$x^* = f(x^*) = r x^* (1 - x^*)$$\nThis equation must be solved for $x^*$. We can rewrite it as:\n$$r x^* (1 - x^*) - x^* = 0$$\nFactoring out $x^*$ gives:\n$$x^* [r(1 - x^*) - 1] = 0$$\nThis equation yields two distinct solutions for the fixed points.\n\nThe first fixed point is the trivial solution:\n$$x_1^* = 0$$\nThis corresponds to the extinction of the population and exists for all values of $r$.\n\nThe second fixed point is found by solving the expression in the brackets:\n$$r(1 - x^*) - 1 = 0$$\n$$r - r x^* - 1 = 0$$\n$$r x^* = r - 1$$\n$$x_2^* = \\frac{r - 1}{r} = 1 - \\frac{1}{r}$$\nThis is the nontrivial fixed point, representing a stable population level. For this fixed point to be biologically relevant within the normalized domain $[0,1]$, we require $x_2^* \\in [0,1]$. Given $r > 0$, the condition $x_2^* \\leq 1$ is always satisfied, as $1 - \\frac{1}{r} \\leq 1$ implies $-\\frac{1}{r} \\leq 0$, which is true. The condition $x_2^* \\geq 0$ requires $1 - \\frac{1}{r} \\geq 0$, which simplifies to $r \\geq 1$. Thus, the nontrivial fixed point $x_2^*$ exists and is positive for $r \\geq 1$. At $r=1$, $x_2^* = x_1^* = 0$.\n\nNext, we analyze the local stability of these fixed points. The stability of a fixed point $x^*$ for a one-dimensional map is determined by the magnitude of the derivative of the map, $f'(x)$, evaluated at that point. Let $\\lambda = f'(x^*)$ be the multiplier. The fixed point is locally stable if $|\\lambda| < 1$ and unstable if $|\\lambda| > 1$. If $|\\lambda| = 1$, the fixed point is neutrally stable, and a bifurcation may occur.\n\nThe derivative of the logistic map $f(x) = rx - rx^2$ is:\n$$f'(x) = \\frac{df}{dx} = r - 2rx$$\n\nWe now evaluate this derivative at each fixed point.\n\nFor the trivial fixed point, $x_1^* = 0$:\n$$\\lambda_1 = f'(0) = r - 2r(0) = r$$\nThe fixed point $x_1^* = 0$ is stable if $|\\lambda_1| = |r| < 1$. Since the problem specifies $r > 0$, this condition becomes $0 < r < 1$. For $r>1$, this fixed point is unstable. At $r=1$, a transcritical bifurcation occurs where the trivial and nontrivial fixed points exchange stability.\n\nFor the nontrivial fixed point, $x_2^* = 1 - \\frac{1}{r}$ (which exists for $r \\geq 1$):\n$$\\lambda_2 = f'\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{r}\\right) = r - 2r\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{r}\\right)$$\n$$\\lambda_2 = r - (2r - 2) = 2 - r$$\nThis fixed point is stable if $|\\lambda_2| = |2 - r| < 1$. This inequality can be expressed as:\n$$-1 < 2 - r < 1$$\nSolving this compound inequality:\n1. $2 - r < 1 \\implies 1 < r$\n2. $-1 < 2 - r \\implies r < 3$\nCombining these results, the nontrivial fixed point $x_2^*$ is stable for $1 < r < 3$.\n\nThe problem asks for the parameter value $r_{\\mathrm{pd}}$ at which the nontrivial fixed point first loses stability through a period-doubling (or flip) bifurcation. A period-doubling bifurcation occurs when the multiplier $\\lambda$ passes through $-1$. For the nontrivial fixed point $x_2^*$, the multiplier is $\\lambda_2 = 2 - r$. We set this equal to $-1$ to find the bifurcation point:\n$$2 - r = -1$$\nSolving for $r$ gives:\n$$r = 3$$\nThis value is designated as $r_{\\mathrm{pd}}$. At $r=3$, the fixed point $x_2^*$ loses its stability because for $r > 3$, the multiplier becomes $\\lambda_2 < -1$, leading to unstable oscillatory dynamics. This instability gives rise to a stable period-$2$ cycle. This is the first period-doubling event in the route to chaos for the logistic map. The multiplier for the trivial fixed point, $\\lambda_1 = r$, is always positive, so it cannot undergo a period-doubling bifurcation.\n\nTherefore, the exact parameter value at which the nontrivial fixed point first undergoes a period-doubling bifurcation is $r_{\\mathrm{pd}} = 3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "2512867"}, {"introduction": "We now advance from single-species discrete dynamics to the continuous interaction between a predator and its prey, governed by the celebrated Rosenzweig-MacArthur model.

The Lyapunov equation expands to:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} -2\\sqrt{\\mu} & 1 \\\\ 0 & -\\frac{1}{\\tau} \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} \\Sigma_{yy} & \\Sigma_{y\\xi} \\\\ \\Sigma_{y\\xi} & \\Sigma_{\\xi\\xi} \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\Sigma_{yy} & \\Sigma_{y\\xi} \\\\ \\Sigma_{y\\xi} & \\Sigma_{\\xi\\xi} \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} -2\\sqrt{\\mu} & 0 \\\\ 1 & -\\frac{1}{\\tau} \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{\\tau} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis gives a system of algebraic equations for the components of $\\Sigma$:\n1.  From the $(2,2)$ element: $-\\frac{2}{\\tau}\\Sigma_{\\xi\\xi} + \\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{\\tau} = 0 \\implies \\Sigma_{\\xi\\xi} = \\sigma^{2}$. This correctly recovers the stationary variance of the OU process.\n2.  From the $(1,2)$ element: $(-2\\sqrt{\\mu}\\Sigma_{y\\xi} + \\Sigma_{\\xi\\xi}) + (-\\frac{1}{\\tau}\\Sigma_{y\\xi}) = 0 \\implies (2\\sqrt{\\mu}+\\frac{1}{\\tau})\\Sigma_{y\\xi} = \\Sigma_{\\xi\\xi} = \\sigma^{2} \\implies \\Sigma_{y\\xi} = \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2\\sqrt{\\mu}+\\frac{1}{\\tau}}$.\n3.  From the $(1,1)$ element: $2(-2\\sqrt{\\mu}\\Sigma_{yy} + \\Sigma_{y\\xi}) = 0 \\implies \\Sigma_{yy} = \\frac{\\Sigma_{y\\xi}}{2\\sqrt{\\mu}}$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Sigma_{y\\xi}$ into the expression for $\\Sigma_{yy}$ gives the variance of $y$. Since $y$ is a perturbation around a constant mean $x^{*}$, $\\operatorname{Var}(x) = \\operatorname{Var}(y) = \\Sigma_{yy}$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\mu}} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2\\sqrt{\\mu}+\\frac{1}{\\tau}} \\right) = \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2\\sqrt{\\mu}(2\\sqrt{\\mu}+\\frac{1}{\\tau})} = \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{4\\mu + \\frac{2}{\\tau}\\mu^{1/2}}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the stationary variance. As $\\mu \\to 0^{+}$, the term proportional to $\\mu^{1/2}$ in the denominator dominates the term proportional to $\\mu$. Thus, the leading-order behavior is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(x) \\approx \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{\\frac{2}{\\tau}\\mu^{1/2}} = \\frac{\\sigma^{2}\\tau}{2}\\mu^{-1/2}\n$$\n\nPart $2$: Scaling of $\\operatorname{Var}(x)$ with $\\mu$.\n\nFrom the leading-order expression derived above, it is clear that as the system approaches the bifurcation point ($\\mu \\to 0^{+}$), the variance scales as:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(x) \\propto \\mu^{-1/2}\n$$\n\nPart $3$: Computation of the scaling exponent $\\beta$.\n\nThe scaling exponent is defined as $\\beta = -\\lim_{\\mu \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{d\\,\\ln \\operatorname{Var}(x)}{d\\,\\ln \\mu}$.\nWe can compute the logarithmic derivative $\\frac{d\\,\\ln V}{d\\,\\ln \\mu}$ where $V(\\mu) = \\operatorname{Var}(x)$. Using the chain rule, $\\frac{d f}{d \\ln \\mu} = \\mu \\frac{df}{d\\mu}$.\nLet's compute $\\ln V(\\mu)$:\n$$\n\\ln V(\\mu) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{4\\mu + 2\\tau^{-1}\\mu^{1/2}}\\right) = \\ln(\\sigma^{2}) - \\ln(4\\mu + 2\\tau^{-1}\\mu^{1/2})\n$$\nDifferentiating with respect to $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\,\\ln V(\\mu)}{d\\mu} = -\\frac{1}{4\\mu + 2\\tau^{-1}\\mu^{1/2}} \\cdot \\left(4 + 2\\tau^{-1}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\mu^{-1/2}\\right) = -\\frac{4 + \\tau^{-1}\\mu^{-1/2}}{4\\mu + 2\\tau^{-1}\\mu^{1/2}}\n$$\nNow, we compute the derivative with respect to $\\ln\\mu$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\,\\ln V(\\mu)}{d\\,\\ln \\mu} = \\mu \\frac{d\\,\\ln V(\\mu)}{d\\mu} = -\\mu \\frac{4 + \\tau^{-1}\\mu^{-1/2}}{4\\mu + 2\\tau^{-1}\\mu^{1/2}} = -\\frac{4\\mu + \\tau^{-1}\\mu^{1/2}}{4\\mu + 2\\tau^{-1}\\mu^{1/2}}\n$$\nWe must evaluate the limit of this expression as $\\mu \\to 0^{+}$:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\mu \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{d\\,\\ln V(\\mu)}{d\\,\\ln \\mu} = \\lim_{\\mu \\to 0^{+}} \\left(-\\frac{4\\mu + \\tau^{-1}\\mu^{1/2}}{4\\mu + 2\\tau^{-1}\\mu^{1/2}}\\right)\n$$\nTo evaluate this limit, we divide the numerator and the denominator by the dominant term for small $\\mu$, which is $\\mu^{1/2}$:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\mu \\to 0^{+}} \\left(-\\frac{4\\mu^{1/2} + \\tau^{-1}}{4\\mu^{1/2} + 2\\tau^{-1}}\\right) = -\\frac{0 + \\tau^{-1}}{0 + 2\\tau^{-1}} = -\\frac{\\tau^{-1}}{2\\tau^{-1}} = -\\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nFinally, we compute $\\beta$ using its definition:\n$$\n\\beta = -\\lim_{\\mu \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{d\\,\\ln \\operatorname{Var}(x)}{d\\,\\ln \\mu} = -\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe value of the scaling-exponent statistic is exactly $1/2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "2512864"}]}
