A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation and Calculation**\n\nThe problem states that the ecological model of a metacommunity of size $J_{m}$ with per-birth speciation probability $\\nu$ can be mapped onto a neutral allelic model for a haploid population. We leverage this analogy.\nIn population genetics, the stationary distribution of allele frequencies under the infinite alleles model is governed by the scaled mutation rate, $\\theta$. For a population undergoing a Moran process, the connection between the model parameters and $\\theta$ is a standard result derived from diffusion theory.\n\nA Moran model considers a population of constant size, which we denote as $N$. At each discrete time step, one individual is chosen to reproduce and one individual is chosen to die. The offspring replaces the dead individual. If the per-individual, per-birth mutation rate is $\\mu$, a new allele appears in the population with this probability at each birth event.\n\nThe diffusion approximation is used to describe the long-term behavior of allele frequencies. In this limit, time is rescaled. For a Moran process of size $N$, the generator of the diffusion process for the frequency of a neutral allele contains a term that depends on the rate of introduction of new alleles into the population. This population-scaled mutation rate is given by $\\theta$. For a haploid Moran process of size $N$ with per-birth mutation rate $\\mu$, this parameter is:\n$$\n\\theta = 2N\\mu\n$$\nThe factor of $2$ arises from the variance in offspring number in the Moran process being twice that of the corresponding Wright-Fisher process when scaled to generations.\n\nWe apply the specified mapping from the ecological model to this population genetics framework:\n1. The metacommunity size $J_{m}$ is analogous to the population size $N$.\n2. The per-birth speciation probability $\\nu$ is analogous to the per-birth mutation rate $\\mu$.\n\nSubstituting these ecological parameters into the expression for $\\theta$ from the Moran model gives the scaling relationship for the fundamental biodiversity number:\n$$\n\\theta = 2J_{m}\\nu\n$$\nThis is the required scaling derivation.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $\\theta$ using the provided data: $J_{m} = 10^{6}$ and $\\nu = 10^{-6}$.\n$$\n\\theta = 2 \\times (10^{6}) \\times (10^{-6})\n$$\n$$\n\\theta = 2 \\times 1\n$$\n$$\n\\theta = 2\n$$\n\n**Interpretation of the Species Abundance Distribution (SAD)**\n\nThe problem asks whether the resulting metacommunity SAD is expected to be highly even or dominated by rare species. The stationary SAD is the Fisher logseries, whose shape is determined by $\\theta$. The parameter $\\theta$ represents the balance between the rate of speciation, which introduces new species and increases diversity, and the rate of ecological drift (random extinction), which removes species and decreases diversity.\n\nThe Fisher logseries distribution is intrinsically highly uneven, with the number of species declining rapidly with their abundance. The most abundant class of species is always the rarest class (singletons, i.e., species with abundance $n=1$). Therefore, the description \"highly even\" is fundamentally incompatible with a logseries SAD.\n\nThe magnitude of $\\theta$ determines the extent of the dominance by rare species. A conventional threshold is $\\theta = 1$.\n- If $\\theta \\ll 1$, drift dominates. New species are rare, and existing species are likely to be lost to drift, leading to a community dominated by a few very successful, high-abundance species.\n- If $\\theta \\gg 1$, speciation is rapid relative to drift. This leads to a constant influx and accumulation of new species, which start at low abundance. The result is a community with a very long tail of rare species.\n\nOur calculated value is $\\theta=2$. Since $\\theta > 1$, the rate of speciation is significant enough compared to the rate of stochastic extinction by drift to allow new species to accumulate. This leads to a community characterized by a large number of low-abundance species. Therefore, the SAD is expected to be dominated by rare species.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "2512186"}, {"introduction": "While the metacommunity acts as a regional source of species, local communities are governed by a dynamic interplay between immigration from this source and internal demographic turnover. The immigration probability, $m$, quantifies the degree of connectivity and is a critical parameter for understanding local diversity patterns.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard model from theoretical ecology, Hubbell's Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity (UNTB), and requests a derivation and calculation based on fundamental principles of probability theory. All necessary parameters are provided, and the task is clear and unambiguous. Therefore, we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected number of immigrant replacement events over a block of $N$ demographic events. Each demographic event is an independent trial where one of two outcomes occurs: replacement by an immigrant or replacement by a locally produced offspring. This structure corresponds to a sequence of Bernoulli trials.\n\nLet us define a random variable $X_i$ for each demographic event $i$, where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $N$. Let $X_i$ be an indicator variable such that:\n$X_i = 1$ if the replacement at event $i$ is an immigrant.\n$X_i = 0$ if the replacement at event $i$ is from local offspring.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the probability of an immigrant replacement is given by the parameter $m$. Thus, for any event $i$:\n$$P(X_i = 1) = m$$\nThe probability of a local replacement is $1 - m$, so:\n$$P(X_i = 0) = 1 - m$$\n\nThe total number of immigrant replacement events over the block of $N$ events is the sum of these indicator variables:\n$$S_N = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$$\n\nWe are asked to find the expected value of $S_N$, which is denoted as $E[S_N]$. We can use the property of linearity of expectation, which states that the expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expectations. This property holds regardless of whether the variables are independent. In this problem, the events are stated to be independent, but linearity of expectation would apply even if they were not.\n$$E[S_N] = E\\left[ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i \\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i]$$\n\nThe expected value of a single Bernoulli random variable $X_i$ is calculated as:\n$$E[X_i] = (1 \\times P(X_i = 1)) + (0 \\times P(X_i = 0)) = (1 \\times m) + (0 \\times (1 - m)) = m$$\n\nSince the probability $m$ is constant for all events, $E[X_i] = m$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$. Substituting this back into the expression for $E[S_N]$:\n$$E[S_N] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m = N \\cdot m$$\nThis is the derived expression for the expected number of immigrant events. The total count of immigrants, $S_N$, follows a binomial distribution, $S_N \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N, m)$, for which the expected value is known to be $N \\cdot m$, consistent with our derivation from first principles.\n\nNext, we must evaluate this expression for the given parameters: the total number of demographic events $N = 10^5$ and the per-event immigration probability $m = 0.05$.\n$$E[S_N] = (10^5) \\times (0.05)$$\n$$E[S_N] = 100000 \\times \\frac{5}{100} = 1000 \\times 5 = 5000$$\nThus, the expected number of immigrants over $10^5$ events is $5000$.\n\nFinally, we must interpret this result ecologically. The local community has a size of $J = 10^4 = 10000$ individuals. The total number of demographic events is $N = 10^5$. The ratio $N/J = 10^5 / 10^4 = 10$ represents the number of complete community turnovers that have occurred, where one turnover is defined as the replacement of $J$ individuals.\nOur result indicates that we expect $5000$ immigrants over the course of $10$ community turnovers. This means, on average, there are $5000 / 10 = 500$ immigrant replacements per turnover.\nThe immigration probability $m = 0.05$ quantifies the coupling between the local community and the regional metacommunity. It means that $5\\%$ of all deaths are replaced by individuals from the metacommunity. This level of immigration prevents the local community from becoming completely isolated. In the absence of immigration ($m=0$), random demographic fluctuations (ecological drift) would eventually lead to the loss of all but one species. The influx of $5000$ immigrants over this period continuously introduces species from the metacommunity, rescuing rare species from local extinction and maintaining higher levels of local biodiversity than would be possible in an isolated system. Therefore, an $m$ of $0.05$ represents a moderately coupled system where both local drift and regional immigration play significant roles in shaping community composition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5000}$$", "id": "2512184"}, {"introduction": "The Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology (METE) offers an alternative, constraint-based framework for predicting ecological patterns, distinct from the process-based approach of neutral theory.

We begin by validating the problem, which is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It represents a standard application of the principle of maximum entropy. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to maximize the Shannon entropy of the energy allocation shares, $H = -\\sum_{i=1}^{S_0} p_i \\ln p_i$, where $p_i = E_i/E_0$ is the fraction of the total community metabolic energy $E_0$ used by species $i$, and $S_0$ is the total number of species. The maximization is subject to the single constraint that the shares must sum to unity, reflecting the conservation of total energy:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{S_0} p_i = 1 $$\nAdditionally, the shares must be non-negative, $p_i \\ge 0$ for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, S_0\\}$.\n\nTo solve this constrained optimization problem, we employ the method of Lagrange multipliers. We define the Lagrangian function $\\mathcal{L}$ as:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(p_1, \\dots, p_{S_0}, \\lambda) = H - \\lambda \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{S_0} p_i - 1 \\right) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{S_0} p_i \\ln p_i - \\lambda \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{S_0} p_i - 1 \\right) $$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the normalization constraint.\n\nFor an extremum, the partial derivative of $\\mathcal{L}$ with respect to each $p_i$ must be zero:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial p_i} = 0 \\quad \\text{for } i = 1, \\dots, S_0 $$\nWe compute the derivative:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_i} \\left( -p_i \\ln p_i - \\lambda p_i \\right) = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial p_i}{\\partial p_i} \\ln p_i + p_i \\frac{\\partial (\\ln p_i)}{\\partial p_i}\\right) - \\lambda = -(\\ln p_i + 1) - \\lambda $$\nSetting this to zero yields:\n$$ - \\ln p_i - 1 - \\lambda = 0 $$\n$$ \\ln p_i = -1 - \\lambda $$\nThis implies that $p_i = \\exp(-1 - \\lambda)$. Crucially, this expression for $p_i$ is independent of the index $i$. This means that the entropy-maximizing distribution allocates the same energy share to every species. Let us denote this common value by $p^*$.\n$$ p_i = p^* \\quad \\forall i $$\nNow, we apply the normalization constraint to find the value of $p^*$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{S_0} p_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{S_0} p^* = S_0 p^* = 1 $$\nSolving for $p^*$, we find:\n$$ p^* = \\frac{1}{S_0} $$\nThis uniform distribution is the most parsimonious prediction for the energy shares given only the total number of species and total energy.\n\nThe first quantity to be derived is the predicted average per-species total energy, $\\langle E_{\\text{species}} \\rangle$. By definition, the energy allocated to species $i$ is $E_i = p_i E_0$. Since we found that $p_i = 1/S_0$ for all species, the energy allocated to any given species is:\n$$ E_i = \\frac{1}{S_0} E_0 $$\nThe average per-species energy is the total energy divided by the number of species:\n$$ \\langle E_{\\text{species}} \\rangle = \\frac{E_0}{S_0} $$\nNote that in this maximally uninformed state, the energy of each species is predicted to be equal to the average.\n\nThe second quantity to be derived is the average per-individual metabolic rate, $\\bar{\\epsilon}$, for a focal species with abundance $n$. The total metabolic energy of this species, which we found to be $\\langle E_{\\text{species}} \\rangle$, must be the sum of the metabolic rates of its $n$ individuals. The average per-individual rate is therefore the species' total energy divided by its abundance:\n$$ \\bar{\\epsilon} = \\frac{\\langle E_{\\text{species}} \\rangle}{n} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\langle E_{\\text{species}} \\rangle$, we get:\n$$ \\bar{\\epsilon} = \\frac{E_0/S_0}{n} = \\frac{E_0}{S_0 n} $$\n\nFinally, we substitute the provided numerical values to compute the final answer.\nGiven:\n- Total community metabolic energy: $E_0 = 5 \\times 10^6$\n- Total number of species: $S_0 = 250$\n- Abundance of a focal species: $n = 100$\n\nFirst, we calculate $\\langle E_{\\text{species}} \\rangle$:\n$$ \\langle E_{\\text{species}} \\rangle = \\frac{E_0}{S_0} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^6}{250} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^6}{2.5 \\times 10^2} = 2 \\times 10^4 = 20000 $$\nNext, we calculate $\\bar{\\epsilon}$ for the focal species:\n$$ \\bar{\\epsilon} = \\frac{\\langle E_{\\text{species}} \\rangle}{n} = \\frac{20000}{100} = 200 $$\n\nThe problem requires the result as a row vector $\\big(\\langle E_{\\text{species}} \\rangle,\\ \\bar{\\epsilon}\\big)$.\nThe final result is $(20000, 200)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n20000  200\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2512230"}]}
