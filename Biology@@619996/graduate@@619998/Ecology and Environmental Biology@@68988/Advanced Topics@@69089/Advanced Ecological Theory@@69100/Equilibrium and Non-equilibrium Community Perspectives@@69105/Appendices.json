The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or factual unsoundness. It represents a standard, non-trivial exercise in stability analysis of ecological models.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe principle of coexistence via mutual invasibility dictates that each species must be able to increase a population from a very low density when its competitor is at its own single-species equilibrium (carrying capacity). We derive the condition for each species to invade.\n\nFirst, consider the invasion of species $1$. Species $1$ is rare ($N_1 \\to 0^+$) and attempts to invade a population of species $2$ established at its carrying capacity. In the absence of species $1$, the equilibrium for species $2$ is $N_2 = K_2$. The per-capita growth rate of species $1$ is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{N_{1}} \\frac{dN_{1}}{dt} = r_{1}\\left(1 - \\frac{N_{1} + \\alpha_{12} N_{2}}{K_{1}}\\right)\n$$\nFor species $1$ to successfully invade, its per-capita growth rate must be positive under these conditions. We evaluate the rate as $N_1 \\to 0^+$ and $N_2 = K_2$:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{1}{N_{1}} \\frac{dN_{1}}{dt} \\right|_{N_1 \\to 0^+, N_2=K_2} = r_{1}\\left(1 - \\frac{0 + \\alpha_{12} K_{2}}{K_{1}}\\right) > 0\n$$\nSince $r_1 > 0$ is a given, this inequality simplifies to:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{\\alpha_{12} K_{2}}{K_{1}} > 0 \\implies K_1 > \\alpha_{12} K_2\n$$\nThis can be written as the first invasion condition:\n$$\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} > \\alpha_{12} \\quad (1)\n$$\nThis condition means that for species $1$ to invade, its own carrying capacity must be greater than the competitive load imposed by species $2$ at its carrying capacity.\n\nSecond, we consider the symmetric case: the invasion of species $2$. Species $2$ is rare ($N_2 \\to 0^+$) and attempts to invade a population of species $1$ established at its carrying capacity, $N_1 = K_1$. The per-capita growth rate of species $2$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{N_{2}} \\frac{dN_{2}}{dt} = r_{2}\\left(1 - \\frac{N_{2} + \\alpha_{21} N_{1}}{K_{2}}\\right)\n$$\nFor species $2$ to invade, its per-capita growth rate must be positive when $N_2 \\to 0^+$ and $N_1 = K_1$:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{1}{N_{2}} \\frac{dN_{2}}{dt} \\right|_{N_2 \\to 0^+, N_1=K_1} = r_{2}\\left(1 - \\frac{0 + \\alpha_{21} K_{1}}{K_{2}}\\right) > 0\n$$\nSince $r_2 > 0$ is a given, we have:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{\\alpha_{21} K_{1}}{K_{2}} > 0 \\implies K_2 > \\alpha_{21} K_1\n$$\nThis gives the second invasion condition, which can be rearranged as:\n$$\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} < \\frac{1}{\\alpha_{21}} \\quad (2)\n$$\nFor coexistence to occur, both invasion conditions, $(1)$ and $(2)$, must be satisfied simultaneously. Combining them yields the canonical condition for stable coexistence:\n$$\n\\alpha_{12} < \\frac{K_1}{K_2} < \\frac{1}{\\alpha_{21}}\n$$\nThis composite inequality is to be rewritten in the form $\\rho < \\phi < 1/\\rho$. We must define $\\rho$ and $\\phi$ appropriately. Let us define the dimensionless niche overlap, $\\rho$, as the geometric mean of the interspecific competition coefficients:\n$$\n\\rho = \\sqrt{\\alpha_{12} \\alpha_{21}}\n$$\nLet us define the dimensionless fitness ratio, $\\phi$, as a measure of the relative competitive abilities of the species, incorporating both carrying capacities and competition coefficients:\n$$\n\\phi = \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha_{21}}{\\alpha_{12}}}\n$$\nNow, we demonstrate that these definitions transform the invasion criteria into the required form.\nConsider the first half of the target inequality, $\\rho < \\phi$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\alpha_{12} \\alpha_{21}} < \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha_{21}}{\\alpha_{12}}}\n$$\nWe multiply both sides by the positive quantity $\\sqrt{\\alpha_{12}/\\alpha_{21}}$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\alpha_{12} \\alpha_{21}} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha_{12}}{\\alpha_{21}}} < \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha_{21}}{\\alpha_{12}}} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha_{12}}{\\alpha_{21}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\alpha_{12}^2} < \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\implies \\alpha_{12} < \\frac{K_1}{K_2}\n$$\nThis is precisely the first invasion condition $(1)$.\n\nNext, consider the second half of the target inequality, $\\phi < 1/\\rho$:\n$$\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha_{21}}{\\alpha_{12}}} < \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha_{12} \\alpha_{21}}}\n$$\nWe rearrange the inequality to isolate the ratio $K_1 / K_2$:\n$$\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} < \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha_{12} \\alpha_{21}}} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha_{12}}{\\alpha_{21}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} < \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha_{21}^2}} \\implies \\frac{K_1}{K_2} < \\frac{1}{\\alpha_{21}}\n$$\nThis is precisely the second invasion condition $(2)$.\nThus, the definitions are correct and the criterion for stable coexistence $\\alpha_{12} < K_1/K_2 < 1/\\alpha_{21}$ is equivalent to $\\rho < \\phi < 1/\\rho$.\n\nFinally, we compute the values of $\\rho$ and $\\phi$ for the given parameters: $\\alpha_{12}=\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\alpha_{21}=\\frac{2}{3}$, $K_1=3$, $K_2=4$. The parameters $r_1$ and $r_2$ do not affect the existence of the equilibrium, only the speed at which it is approached.\nThe niche overlap $\\rho$ is:\n$$\n\\rho = \\sqrt{\\alpha_{12} \\alpha_{21}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n$$\nThe fitness ratio $\\phi$ is:\n$$\n\\phi = \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha_{21}}{\\alpha_{12}}} = \\frac{3}{4} \\sqrt{\\frac{2/3}{1/2}} = \\frac{3}{4} \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 2} = \\frac{3}{4} \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{3}} = \\frac{3}{4} \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{3}{2\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{6} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n$$\nTo verify that these values satisfy the coexistence condition, we check if $\\rho < \\phi < 1/\\rho$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} < \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} < \\sqrt{3}\n$$\nThe first inequality $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} < \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ is true since $\\frac{1}{3} < \\frac{1}{2}$. The second inequality $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} < \\sqrt{3}$ is true since $\\frac{1}{2} < 1$. Therefore, the conditions for coexistence are met.

The problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows.\n\nFirst, we analyze Model E. The process is given by:\n$$\ny_{t+1} \\;=\\; \\mu \\;+\\; \\phi(y_t - \\mu) \\;+\\; \\varepsilon_t\n$$\nThis is a first-order autoregressive process, or AR($1$), for the centered variable $z_t = y_t - \\mu$.\nIn the stationary regime, the mean is $\\mathbb{E}[y_t] = \\mu$. This can be verified by taking the expectation of the process equation: $\\mathbb{E}[y_{t+1}] = \\mu + \\phi(\\mathbb{E}[y_t] - \\mu) + \\mathbb{E}[\\varepsilon_t]$. For a stationary process, $\\mathbb{E}[y_{t+1}] = \\mathbb{E}[y_t] = E_y$, which gives $E_y = \\mu + \\phi(E_y - \\mu)$, leading to $(1-\\phi)E_y = (1-\\phi)\\mu$, so $E_y=\\mu$.\n\nThe stationary variance, $V_E = \\operatorname{Var}(y_t)$, is found by taking the variance of the process equation. Since $\\mu$ is a constant, $\\operatorname{Var}(y_{t+1}) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\phi y_t + (1-\\phi)\\mu + \\varepsilon_t - \\mu) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\phi y_t + \\varepsilon_t)$. Because $y_t$ is a function of past innovations $\\{\\varepsilon_{t-1}, \\varepsilon_{t-2}, \\dots \\}$, it is independent of $\\varepsilon_t$. Thus:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(y_{t+1}) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\phi y_t) + \\operatorname{Var}(\\varepsilon_t) = \\phi^2 \\operatorname{Var}(y_t) + \\sigma^2\n$$\nIn stationarity, $\\operatorname{Var}(y_{t+1}) = \\operatorname{Var}(y_t) = V_E$.\n$$\nV_E = \\phi^2 V_E + \\sigma^2 \\implies V_E(1 - \\phi^2) = \\sigma^2\n$$\nGiven $|\\phi|<1$, we find the stationary variance for Model E:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(y_t \\mid \\text{Model E}) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{1 - \\phi^2}\n$$\nNext, we compute the lag-$1$ autocovariance, $\\gamma_1(\\text{Model E}) = \\operatorname{Cov}(y_{t+1}, y_t)$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(y_{t+1}, y_t) = \\operatorname{Cov}(\\mu + \\phi(y_t - \\mu) + \\varepsilon_t, y_t) = \\operatorname{Cov}(\\phi y_t, y_t) + \\operatorname{Cov}(\\varepsilon_t, y_t)\n$$\nAs $\\varepsilon_t$ is independent of $y_t$, $\\operatorname{Cov}(\\varepsilon_t, y_t) = 0$.\n$$\n\\gamma_1(\\text{Model E}) = \\phi \\operatorname{Cov}(y_t, y_t) = \\phi \\operatorname{Var}(y_t) = \\frac{\\phi \\sigma^2}{1 - \\phi^2}\n$$\nThe lag-$1$ autocorrelation is $\\rho_1(\\text{Model E}) = \\frac{\\gamma_1(\\text{Model E})}{\\operatorname{Var}(y_t \\mid \\text{Model E})}$.\n$$\n\\rho_1(\\text{Model E}) = \\frac{\\phi \\operatorname{Var}(y_t)}{\\operatorname{Var}(y_t)} = \\phi\n$$\n\nSecond, we analyze Model N. With the constraint $\\tau^2=0$, the process is:\n$$\ny_t = \\mu + s w_t\n$$\nThe mean is $\\mathbb{E}[y_t] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mu + s w_t] = \\mu + s \\mathbb{E}[w_t]$. Given $\\mathbb{E}[w_t]=0$, we have $\\mathbb{E}[y_t] = \\mu$, which matches Model E.\n\nThe stationary variance, $V_N = \\operatorname{Var}(y_t)$, is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(y_t \\mid \\text{Model N}) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\mu + s w_t) = s^2 \\operatorname{Var}(w_t)\n$$\nGiven $\\operatorname{Var}(w_t)=1$, we have:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(y_t \\mid \\text{Model N}) = s^2\n$$\nThe problem imposes the variance-matching constraint $\\operatorname{Var}(y_t \\mid \\text{Model E}) = \\operatorname{Var}(y_t \\mid \\text{Model N})$. This directly implies:\n$$\ns^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{1 - \\phi^2}\n$$\nNow, we compute the lag-$1$ autocovariance for Model N, $\\gamma_1(\\text{Model N}) = \\operatorname{Cov}(y_{t+1}, y_t)$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(y_{t+1}, y_t) = \\operatorname{Cov}(\\mu + s w_{t+1}, \\mu + s w_t) = s^2 \\operatorname{Cov}(w_{t+1}, w_t)\n$$\nThe covariance of the Markov chain $w_t$ is $\\operatorname{Cov}(w_{t+1}, w_t) = \\mathbb{E}[w_{t+1} w_t] - \\mathbb{E}[w_{t+1}]\\mathbb{E}[w_t]$. Since $\\mathbb{E}[w_t]=0$, this simplifies to $\\mathbb{E}[w_{t+1} w_t]$. We compute this using the law of total expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[w_{t+1} w_t] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[w_{t+1} w_t \\mid w_t]] = \\mathbb{E}[w_t \\mathbb{E}[w_{t+1} \\mid w_t]]\n$$\nThe conditional expectation $\\mathbb{E}[w_{t+1} \\mid w_t]$ is calculated based on the transition probabilities.\nIf $w_t=w_{t+1}$, the probability is $r$. If $w_t \\neq w_{t+1}$, the probability is $1-r$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[w_{t+1} \\mid w_t] = (+w_t) \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(w_{t+1}=w_t \\mid w_t) + (-w_t) \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(w_{t+1}=-w_t \\mid w_t) = w_t \\cdot r + (-w_t) \\cdot (1-r) = w_t (r - (1-r)) = (2r - 1)w_t\n$$\nSubstituting this back:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[w_{t+1} w_t] = \\mathbb{E}[w_t \\cdot (2r-1)w_t] = (2r-1)\\mathbb{E}[w_t^2]\n$$\nSince $\\operatorname{Var(w_t)} = \\mathbb{E}[w_t^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[w_t])^2$ and $\\mathbb{E}[w_t]=0$, $\\operatorname{Var}(w_t)=1$, we must have $\\mathbb{E}[w_t^2]=1$.\nTherefore, $\\operatorname{Cov}(w_{t+1}, w_t) = \\mathbb{E}[w_{t+1} w_t] = 2r-1$.\nThe autocovariance for Model N is:\n$$\n\\gamma_1(\\text{Model N}) = s^2(2r-1)\n$$\nThe lag-$1$ autocorrelation for Model N follows directly:\n$$\n\\rho_1(\\text{Model N}) = \\frac{\\gamma_1(\\text{Model N})}{\\operatorname{Var}(y_t \\mid \\text{Model N})} = \\frac{s^2(2r-1)}{s^2} = 2r - 1\n$$\nFinally, we compute the required differences.\nThe difference in variance is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{Var} = \\operatorname{Var}(y_t \\mid \\text{Model E}) - \\operatorname{Var}(y_t \\mid \\text{Model N})\n$$\nBy explicit construction in the problem statement via the variance-matching constraint, this difference is zero.\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{Var} = 0\n$$\nThe difference in lag-$1$ autocorrelation is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\rho_1 = \\rho_1(\\text{Model E}) - \\rho_1(\\text{Model N}) = \\phi - (2r-1) = \\phi - 2r + 1\n$$\nThe result is a pair of values, $(\\Delta \\mathrm{Var}, \\Delta \\rho_1)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\phi - 2r + 1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2489648"}]}
