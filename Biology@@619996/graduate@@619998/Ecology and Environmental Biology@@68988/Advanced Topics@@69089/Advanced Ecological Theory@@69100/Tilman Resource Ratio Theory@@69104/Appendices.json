It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We shall proceed with the derivation as requested.\n\nThe dynamics of a consumer population, $N$, and a limiting resource, $R$, in a chemostat are described by a system of ordinary differential equations. For the consumer population, the rate of change is given by its growth minus its loss due to dilution:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = N \\cdot \\mu(R) - D \\cdot N $$\nwhere $\\mu(R)$ is the per-capita growth rate as a function of resource concentration $R$, and $D$ is the dilution rate of the chemostat.\n\nThe problem states that we are at a demographic steady state ($dN/dt = 0$) with a persisting population ($N > 0$). This is a non-trivial equilibrium. Setting the equation for $dN/dt$ to zero, we have:\n$$ N(\\mu(R) - D) = 0 $$\nSince the population persists, we must have $N > 0$. This forces the term in the parenthesis to be zero:\n$$ \\mu(R) - D = 0 $$\nThis equation defines the core principle of chemostat theory: at steady state, the specific growth rate of the organism must exactly equal the dilution rate. The resource concentration $R$ that satisfies this condition is defined as the break-even resource concentration, denoted $R^{*}$. Therefore, we have:\n$$ \\mu(R^{*}) = D $$\n\nThe problem provides the Monod function for the specific growth rate:\n$$ \\mu(R) = \\mu_{\\max} \\frac{R}{K + R} $$\nwhere $\\mu_{\\max}$ is the maximum specific growth rate and $K$ is the half-saturation constant.\n\nSubstituting this function into our steady-state condition gives:\n$$ \\mu_{\\max} \\frac{R^{*}}{K + R^{*}} = D $$\n\nWe will now solve this equation for $R^{*}$. A persistent population ($R^{*} \\ge 0$) is only possible if the maximum growth rate is greater than the dilution rate, i.e., $\\mu_{\\max} > D$.

The value $R^{*}$ represents the minimum resource concentration required for a species to survive in a given environment. It is the level to which a species, when growing alone, will reduce the concentration of its limiting resource. If multiple species compete for the same single limiting resource, the species with the lowest $R^{*}$ value is the superior competitor. This species will be able to continue growing at resource concentrations that are too low for its competitors, thus driving the resource concentration down to its own $R^{*}$ level and causing the exclusion of all other species.

The state of the system is represented by a point in the resource-concentration plane, $(R_{1}, R_{2})$.\n\nFirst, we define the species’ Zero Net Growth Isocline (ZNGI). The ZNGI is the boundary in the resource space at which the species' specific growth rate equals its loss rate. For two strictly essential resources, the ZNGI is the union of two perpendicular lines.

A species population can only persist if the environmental resource concentrations are above this boundary.\n\nThe resource dynamics in the chemostat are described by the process of consumption. The system starts at the resource supply point, $S = (S_{1}, S_{2}) = (2.0, 3.5)$. As the organism grows, it depletes resources in a fixed ratio defined by its consumption vector, $\\mathbf{c} = (c_{1}, c_{2}) = (0.8, 0.2)$. The resource concentration in the environment, $\\mathbf{R}$, thus moves from $S$ along a straight line with direction $-\\mathbf{c}$.\n\nThis trajectory can be described parametrically. Let $k \\ge 0$ be a scalar representing the extent of resource depletion, which is proportional to the integrated biomass over time. The resource concentration vector $\\mathbf{R}(k)$ is given by:\n$$ \\mathbf{R}(k) = S - k\\mathbf{c} $$\nSubstituting the given values, we obtain the coordinates of the resource point as a function of $k$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} R_{1}(k) \\\\ R_{2}(k) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2.0 \\\\ 3.5 \\end{pmatrix} - k \\begin{pmatrix} 0.8 \\\\ 0.2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2.0 - 0.8k \\\\ 3.5 - 0.2k \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe system reaches a stable equilibrium, $R^{\\mathrm{eq}} = (R_{1}^{\\mathrm{eq}}, R_{2}^{\\mathrm{eq}})$, when this resource trajectory first intersects the ZNGI. We must find the smallest positive value of $k$ that places the point $\\mathbf{R}(k)$ on the ZNGI.\n\nWe investigate the intersection of the trajectory with each segment of the ZNGI.\n\nCase 1: Intersection with the vertical segment of the ZNGI, where $R_{1} = R_{1}^{\\ast} = 0.5$.\nWe set the first component of $\\mathbf{R}(k)$ equal to $0.5$:\n$$ 2.0 - 0.8k_{1} = 0.5 $$\nSolving for the parameter $k_{1}$:\n$$ 0.8k_{1} = 2.0 - 0.5 = 1.5 $$\n$$ k_{1} = \\frac{1.5}{0.8} = \\frac{15}{8} = 1.875 $$\nWe then find the corresponding concentration of the second resource, $R_{2}$:\n$$ R_{2}(k_{1}) = 3.5 - 0.2(1.875) = 3.5 - 0.375 = 3.125 $$\nFor this intersection to be part of the ZNGI, the condition $R_{2} \\ge R_{2}^{\\ast}$ must hold. We check: $3.125 \\ge 0.7$. The condition is satisfied. Thus, a valid intersection occurs at the point $(0.5, 3.125)$ for $k_{1} = 1.875$.\n\nCase 2: Intersection with the horizontal segment of the ZNGI, where $R_{2} = R_{2}^{\\ast} = 0.7$.\nWe set the second component of $\\mathbf{R}(k)$ equal to $0.7$:\n$$ 3.5 - 0.2k_{2} = 0.7 $$\nSolving for the parameter $k_{2}$:\n$$ 0.2k_{2} = 3.5 - 0.7 = 2.8 $$\n$$ k_{2} = \\frac{2.8}{0.2} = 14 $$\nWe find the corresponding concentration of the first resource, $R_{1}$:\n$$ R_{1}(k_{2}) = 2.0 - 0.8(14) = 2.0 - 11.2 = -9.2 $$\nFor this intersection to be part of the ZNGI, the condition $R_{1} \\ge R_{1}^{\\ast}$ must hold. We check: $-9.2 \\ge 0.5$. The condition is not satisfied. This point lies on the mathematical extension of the line $R_{2} = 0.7$ but is not on the ZNGI itself. A negative concentration is also physically meaningless.\n\nThe first intersection along the trajectory determines the equilibrium. This corresponds to the minimum positive value of $k$ that yields a valid intersection. Comparing our two results, $k_{1} = 1.875$ and $k_{2} = 14$, we see that $k_{1} < k_{2}$. Therefore, the resource trajectory first makes contact with the vertical portion of the ZNGI.\n\nThe coordinates of this first intersection point define the single-species resource equilibrium.\n$$ R^{\\mathrm{eq}} = (R_{1}^{\\mathrm{eq}}, R_{2}^{\\mathrm{eq}}) = (0.5, 3.125) $$\nIn this equilibrium, the species is limited by resource $R_{1}$, as the concentration of $R_{2}$ is well above its minimum requirement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}0.5 & 3.125\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2539708"}, {"introduction": "The predictive power of resource-ratio theory lies in its ability to forecast community structure from species' physiological traits and environmental resource supply.

The ZNGI for a species $i$ represents the combinations of resource levels $(R_1, R_2)$ at which its specific growth rate equals its mortality rate (in this case, the chemostat dilution rate). According to Liebig's law of the minimum, the ZNGI is formed by two perpendicular lines.

Thus, species $B$ is the superior competitor for $R_2$.\n\nSince each species is the superior competitor for a different resource, there exists a trade-off, which is the necessary condition for stable coexistence. If coexistence occurs, the two species will drive the resource concentrations to an equilibrium point where each species is limited by the resource for which it is the poorer competitor. This equilibrium point, $P_{coex}$, is the intersection of their ZNGIs.\n- Species $A$ is the poorer competitor for $R_2$, so it will be limited by $R_2$.
