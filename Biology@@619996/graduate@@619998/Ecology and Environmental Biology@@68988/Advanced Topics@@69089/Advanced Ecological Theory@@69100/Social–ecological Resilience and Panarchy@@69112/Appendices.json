The model $\\dot{x} = -\\frac{dU}{dx}$ represents gradient descent on a potential energy landscape, a fundamental concept in physics, chemistry, and engineering. The quartic potential $U(x)=a x^{4}-b x^{2}$ is the canonical form of a double-well potential used to model bistability and phase transitions (e.g., Landau theory). The resilience metrics are standard, intuitive measures of stability within this framework. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The parameters $a>0$ and $b>0$ are correctly specified to ensure the existence of the two stable states. The problem contains no scientific fallacies, vagueness, or contradictions. It is a standard exercise in calculus and stability analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe core of the problem is to find and classify the equilibrium points of the system, which correspond to the extrema of the potential function $U(x)$. The equilibria are the solutions to $\\frac{dU}{dx} = 0$.\n\nFirst, we compute the derivative of the potential $U(x)=a x^{4}-b x^{2}$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}(a x^{4}-b x^{2}) = 4ax^{3}-2bx\n$$\nTo find the equilibrium points, we set the derivative to zero:\n$$\n4ax^{3}-2bx = 0\n$$\n$$\n2x(2ax^{2}-b) = 0\n$$\nThis equation yields three distinct real solutions for the equilibrium positions, since $a,b>0$:\n1. $x=0$\n2. $2ax^{2}-b=0 \\implies x^{2} = \\frac{b}{2a} \\implies x = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{b}{2a}}$\n\nSo, we have three equilibrium points: $x_{0}=0$, $x_{s1}=-\\sqrt{\\frac{b}{2a}}$, and $x_{s2}=+\\sqrt{\\frac{b}{2a}}$.\n\nNext, to determine the stability of these equilibria, we use the second derivative test. Stable equilibria are local minima of $U(x)$, where $\\frac{d^{2}U}{dx^{2}} > 0$. Unstable equilibria (thresholds) are local maxima of $U(x)$, where $\\frac{d^{2}U}{dx^{2}} < 0$. The second derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}U}{dx^{2}} = \\frac{d}{dx}(4ax^{3}-2bx) = 12ax^{2}-2b\n$$\nWe evaluate the sign of the second derivative at each equilibrium point:\n- For $x=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}U}{dx^{2}}\\bigg|_{x=0} = 12a(0)^{2}-2b = -2b\n$$\nSince $b>0$, we have $-2b < 0$. Therefore, $x=0$ is a local maximum of the potential, which corresponds to an unstable equilibrium. This is the threshold, so $x_{\\text{threshold}}=0$.\n\n- For $x=\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{b}{2a}}$:\nWe only need to evaluate $x^{2}=\\frac{b}{2a}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}U}{dx^{2}}\\bigg|_{x^{2}=\\frac{b}{2a}} = 12a\\left(\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)-2b = 6b-2b = 4b\n$$\nSince $b>0$, we have $4b > 0$. Therefore, $x=\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{b}{2a}}$ are local minima of the potential, corresponding to the two stable equilibria. Let us denote one as $x_{\\text{stable}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{b}{2a}}$. Due to the symmetry of the potential ($U(x) = U(-x)$), the choice of which stable state to analyze does not matter.\n\nNow we can derive the expressions for the two resilience metrics.\n\n**Basin-width resilience, $\\Delta x$**:\nThis is the distance from a stable equilibrium to the nearest threshold.\n$$\nx_{\\text{stable}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{b}{2a}}\n$$\n$$\nx_{\\text{threshold}} = 0\n$$\nThe distance is:\n$$\n\\Delta x = |x_{\\text{stable}} - x_{\\text{threshold}}| = \\left|\\sqrt{\\frac{b}{2a}} - 0\\right| = \\sqrt{\\frac{b}{2a}}\n$$\n\n**Energy-barrier resilience, $\\Delta U$**:\nThis is the potential difference between the threshold and the stable equilibrium.\n$$\n\\Delta U = U(x_{\\text{threshold}}) - U(x_{\\text{stable}})\n$$\nFirst, we evaluate the potential at the equilibrium points:\n- At the threshold, $x_{\\text{threshold}}=0$:\n$$\nU(x_{\\text{threshold}}) = U(0) = a(0)^{4}-b(0)^{2}=0\n$$\n- At the stable state, $x_{\\text{stable}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{b}{2a}}$:\n$$\nU(x_{\\text{stable}}) = U\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{b}{2a}}\\right) = a\\left(\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{b}{2a}}\\right)^{2}\\right)^{2} - b\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{b}{2a}}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n$$\n= a\\left(\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^{2} - b\\left(\\frac{b}{2a}\\right) = a\\left(\\frac{b^{2}}{4a^{2}}\\right) - \\frac{b^{2}}{2a} = \\frac{b^{2}}{4a} - \\frac{2b^{2}}{4a} = -\\frac{b^{2}}{4a}\n$$\nThe potential difference is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta U = 0 - \\left(-\\frac{b^{2}}{4a}\\right) = \\frac{b^{2}}{4a}\n$$\n\nFinally, we analyze the behavior of these metrics as $b \\to 0^{+}$.\nThe parameter $b$ controls the depth of the wells and their separation. The term $-bx^2$ creates the instability at the origin, leading to the formation of the two wells. The $ax^4$ term ensures the potential is bounded from below for large $|x|$. As $b$ decreases, the effect of the $-bx^2$ term weakens.\n- For $\\Delta x = \\sqrt{\\frac{b}{2a}}$:\n$$\n\\lim_{b\\to 0^{+}} \\Delta x = \\lim_{b\\to 0^{+}} \\sqrt{\\frac{b}{2a}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0}{2a}} = 0\n$$\nAs $b$ approaches $0$, the basin width $\\Delta x$ shrinks to $0$. The stable equilibria at $\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{b}{2a}}$ converge to the threshold at $x=0$.\n- For $\\Delta U = \\frac{b^{2}}{4a}$:\n$$\n\\lim_{b\\to 0^{+}} \\Delta U = \\lim_{b\\to 0^{+}} \\frac{b^{2}}{4a} = \\frac{0^{2}}{4a} = 0\n$$\nAs $b$ approaches $0$, the barrier height $\\Delta U$ also vanishes. The potential wells become shallower and disappear, merging into a single, flat-bottomed well at $x=0$ (specifically, $U(x)=ax^4$ for $b=0$).\n\nIn conclusion, as $b$ decreases to zero, both the basin width and the energy barrier collapse, indicating a loss of bistability and a critical transition where the two alternative stable states merge and annihilate.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sqrt{\\frac{b}{2a}} & \\frac{b^{2}}{4a}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2532715"}, {"introduction": "Moving from a simple abstract system to a more realistic scenario, this practice explores a coupled social-ecological system using a system of ordinary differential equations.

This probability is found by integrating the joint PDF over the region of the first quadrant of the $t_{d}$-$t_{r}$ plane where $t_{d} < t_{r}$.\n\n$$P(T_{d} < T_{r}) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\int_{0}^{t_{r}} f(t_{d}, t_{r}) \\, dt_{d} \\, dt_{r}$$\n$$P(T_{d} < T_{r}) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\int_{0}^{t_{r}} \\lambda_{d} \\mu \\exp(-\\lambda_{d} t_{d} - \\mu t_{r}) \\, dt_{d} \\, dt_{r}$$\n\nWe perform the integration, starting with the inner integral with respect to $t_{d}$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{t_{r}} \\lambda_{d} \\exp(-\\lambda_{d} t_{d}) \\, dt_{d} = \\left[ -\\exp(-\\lambda_{d} t_{d}) \\right]_{0}^{t_{r}} = -\\exp(-\\lambda_{d} t_{r}) - (-\\exp(0)) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{d} t_{r})$$\nThis inner integral is, by definition, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of $T_{d}$ evaluated at $t_{r}$, i.e., $P(T_{d} \\le t_{r})$.\n\nNow, we substitute this result back into the outer integral:\n$$P(T_{d} < T_{r}) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\mu \\exp(-\\mu t_{r}) \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{d} t_{r})\\right) \\, dt_{r}$$\n$$P(T_{d} < T_{r}) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\mu \\exp(-\\mu t_{r}) - \\mu \\exp(-(\\lambda_{d} + \\mu) t_{r}) \\right) \\, dt_{r}$$\nWe integrate this expression term by term:\n$$P(T_{d} < T_{r}) = \\left[ -\\exp(-\\mu t_{r}) - \\frac{\\mu}{-(\\lambda_{d} + \\mu)} \\exp(-(\\lambda_{d} + \\mu) t_{r}) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty}$$\n$$P(T_{d} < T_{r}) = \\left[ \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda_{d} + \\mu} \\exp(-(\\lambda_{d} + \\mu) t_{r}) - \\exp(-\\mu t_{r}) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty}$$\n\nEvaluating at the upper limit $t_{r} \\to \\infty$:\n$$\\lim_{t_{r} \\to \\infty} \\left( \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda_{d} + \\mu} \\exp(-(\\lambda_{d} + \\mu) t_{r}) - \\exp(-\\mu t_{r}) \\right) = 0 - 0 = 0$$\n...since $\\lambda_{d} > 0$ and $\\mu > 0$.\n\nEvaluating at the lower limit $t_{r} = 0$:\n$$\\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda_{d} + \\mu} \\exp(0) - \\exp(0) = \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda_{d} + \\mu} - 1$$\n\nThe value of the definite integral is (value at upper limit) - (value at lower limit):\n$$P(T_{d} < T_{r}) = 0 - \\left( \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda_{d} + \\mu} - 1 \\right) = 1 - \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda_{d} + \\mu} = \\frac{\\lambda_{d} + \\mu - \\mu}{\\lambda_{d} + \\mu} = \\frac{\\lambda_{d}}{\\lambda_{d} + \\mu}$$\n\nThe management constraint requires that this probability be at most $\\epsilon$:\n$$P(T_{d} < T_{r}) \\le \\epsilon$$\n$$\\frac{\\lambda_{d}}{\\lambda_{d} + \\mu} \\le \\epsilon$$\n\nWe must now solve this inequality for $\\lambda_{d}$. Since $\\lambda_{d} > 0$ and $\\mu > 0$, the denominator $(\\lambda_{d} + \\mu)$ is strictly positive, so we can multiply both sides by it without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$\\lambda_{d} \\le \\epsilon (\\lambda_{d} + \\mu)$$\n$$\\lambda_{d} \\le \\epsilon \\lambda_{d} + \\epsilon \\mu$$\n$$\\lambda_{d} - \\epsilon \\lambda_{d} \\le \\epsilon \\mu$$\n$$\\lambda_{d} (1 - \\epsilon) \\le \\epsilon \\mu$$\n\nThe problem specifies that $0 < \\epsilon < 1$, which implies that $(1 - \\epsilon)$ is a positive quantity. We can therefore divide by $(1 - \\epsilon)$ without altering the inequality:\n$$\\lambda_{d} \\le \\frac{\\epsilon \\mu}{1 - \\epsilon}$$\n\nThis inequality defines the acceptable range for the disturbance rate $\\lambda_{d}$. The maximum allowable disturbance rate, $\\lambda_{d}^{\\max}$, is the upper bound of this range.\n$$\\lambda_{d}^{\\max} = \\frac{\\epsilon \\mu}{1 - \\epsilon}$$\nThe units of $\\mu$ are inverse time, and $\\epsilon$ is dimensionless. Thus, the units of $\\lambda_{d}^{\\max}$ are inverse time, which is consistent with the definition of a Poisson rate.
