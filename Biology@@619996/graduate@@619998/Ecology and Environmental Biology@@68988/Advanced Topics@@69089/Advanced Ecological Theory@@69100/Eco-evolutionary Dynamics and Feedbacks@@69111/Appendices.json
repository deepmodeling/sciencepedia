It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, ill-posed, or trivial.

A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe instantaneous rate of change of the mean trait, $\\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}/\\mathrm{d}t$, is described by the continuous-time Price equation. In the absence of transmission bias (Assumption iii), this equation states that the rate of evolution due to selection is equal to the covariance between the trait value and Malthusian fitness. For a trait with a heritable component, the response to selection is governed by the breeder's equation. In its continuous-time form, Lande's equation gives the rate of change of the mean trait as the product of the additive genetic variance and the selection gradient:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = G \\beta_s\n$$\nHere, $G$ is the additive genetic variance, as given in Assumption (i). For an asexual population, all genetic variance is additive. The selection gradient, $\\beta_s$, is defined as the partial derivative of the mean Malthusian fitness, $\\bar{m}$, with respect to the mean trait, $\\bar{z}$:\n$$\n\\beta_s = \\frac{\\partial \\bar{m}}{\\partial \\bar{z}}\n$$\nThis formulation is accurate under the given assumptions of a normal trait distribution (ii) and weak selection (iv).\n\nFirst, we define the Malthusian fitness, $m(z_i, N)$, as the natural logarithm of the absolute fitness, $w(z_i, N)$:\n$$\nm(z_i, N) = \\ln(w(z_i, N)) = \\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(\\gamma z_{i}-\\beta N-\\frac{\\delta}{2}z_{i}^{2}\\right)\\right) = \\gamma z_i - \\beta N - \\frac{\\delta}{2}z_i^2\n$$\nNext, we calculate the mean Malthusian fitness, $\\bar{m}$, by taking the expectation of $m(z_i, N)$ over the population's trait distribution. Assumption (ii) states this distribution is normal with mean $\\bar{z}$ and variance $P$. As the population is asexual and the trait is determined additively, the phenotypic variance $P$ is equal to the additive genetic variance $G$. Thus, $z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\bar{z}, G)$.\n$$\n\\bar{m} = \\text{E}[m(z, N)] = \\text{E}\\left[\\gamma z - \\beta N - \\frac{\\delta}{2}z^2\\right]\n$$\nBy the linearity of expectation:\n$$\n\\bar{m} = \\gamma \\text{E}[z] - \\beta N - \\frac{\\delta}{2}\\text{E}[z^2]\n$$\nFor a random variable $z$ with mean $\\bar{z}$ and variance $G$, we have $\\text{E}[z] = \\bar{z}$ and $\\text{E}[z^2] = \\text{Var}(z) + (\\text{E}[z])^2 = G + \\bar{z}^2$. Substituting these into the expression for $\\bar{m}$:\n$$\n\\bar{m}(\\bar{z}, N, G) = \\gamma \\bar{z} - \\beta N - \\frac{\\delta}{2}(G + \\bar{z}^2)\n$$\nNow, we compute the selection gradient $\\beta_s$ by differentiating $\\bar{m}$ with respect to $\\bar{z}$. We treat $G$ and $N$ as parameters that do not vary with $\\bar{z}$ for this partial derivative.\n$$\n\\beta_s = \\frac{\\partial \\bar{m}}{\\partial \\bar{z}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}}\\left(\\gamma \\bar{z} - \\beta N - \\frac{\\delta}{2}G - \\frac{\\delta}{2}\\bar{z}^2\\right)\n$$\nThe terms $-\\beta N$ and $-\\frac{\\delta}{2}G$ are constant with respect to $\\bar{z}$, so their derivatives are zero.\n$$\n\\beta_s = \\gamma - \\delta \\bar{z}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for the selection gradient into Lande's equation to find the evolutionary response:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = G \\beta_s = G(\\gamma - \\delta \\bar{z})\n$$\nThis is the instantaneous evolutionary response of the mean trait.\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of how $\\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}/\\mathrm{d}t$ depends on the population density $N$. Examining the derived expression, $\\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}/\\mathrm{d}t = G(\\gamma - \\delta \\bar{z})$, it is evident that it does not contain the variable $N$. The rate of evolutionary change of the mean trait is independent of the current population density. This is because the density-dependent term in the fitness function, $-\\beta N$, is additive in the Malthusian fitness scale. It acts as a uniform pressure on all individuals regardless of their trait value $z_i$. Consequently, it affects the population's mean growth rate (an ecological effect) but does not alter the fitness differences between phenotypes, and therefore does not generate a selective pressure on the trait $z$ itself. The evolutionary dynamics of $\\bar{z}$ are driven solely by the part of selection that is a function of $z_i$, which in this case is the stabilizing selection component $\\gamma z_i - \\frac{\\delta}{2}z_i^2$. This decoupling of the instantaneous evolutionary rate of the trait from population density is a specific consequence of the additive structure of the Malthusian fitness function.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{G(\\gamma - \\delta\\bar{z})}\n$$", "id": "2481855"}, {"introduction": "With the fundamentals of evolutionary rates established, we can now explore how this evolution ripples through an ecological community.

Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe ecological dynamics are given by the system of differential equations:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = r N \\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right) - \\frac{a(z) N}{1 + h a(z) N} P $$\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = e \\frac{a(z) N}{1 + h a(z) N} P - m(z) P $$\n\nWe are concerned with a non-trivial coexistence equilibrium $(N^{*}(z), P^{*}(z))$, where $N^{*}(z) > 0$ and $P^{*}(z) > 0$.

All these quantities, except for the constants $e$ and $h$, are functions of $z$.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of $N'$ using implicit differentiation, without first solving for $N$ algebraically.

We compute this second derivative:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 s}{\\partial y^2}\\right|_{y=x} = r\\left( \\left. \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} \\ln(\\alpha(y,x)) \\right|_{y=x} - \\left. \\frac{d^2}{dz^2} \\ln(K(z)) \\right|_{z=x} \\right)\n$$\nThis formula is a standard result from adaptive dynamics theory. The first derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\ln(\\alpha(y,x)) = -\\frac{y-x}{\\sigma_\\alpha^2} \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} \\ln(\\alpha(y,x)) = -\\frac{1}{\\sigma_\\alpha^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dz} \\ln(K(z)) = -\\frac{z-\\theta}{\\sigma_K^2} \\implies \\frac{d^2}{dz^2} \\ln(K(z)) = -\\frac{1}{\\sigma_K^2}\n$$\nEvaluating at $y=x=x^{\\star}$:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 s}{\\partial y^2}\\right|_{y=x^{\\star}} = r \\left( \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sigma_\\alpha^2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sigma_K^2}\\right) \\right) = r \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sigma_K^2} - \\frac{1}{\\sigma_\\alpha^2} \\right)\n$$\nThe ESS condition, $\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 s}{\\partial y^2}\\right|_{y=x^{\\star}} < 0$, is met if:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sigma_K^2} < \\frac{1}{\\sigma_\\alpha^2} \\iff \\sigma_\\alpha^2 > \\sigma_K^2 \\iff \\sigma_\\alpha > \\sigma_K\n$$\nIf $\\sigma_\\alpha > \\sigma_K$, selection is stabilizing. If $\\sigma_\\alpha < \\sigma_K$, selection is disruptive, and the singular point is evolutionarily unstable.\n\nFinally, we check convergence stability. A singular strategy is convergence stable if $\\left.\\frac{dg(x)}{dx}\\right|_{x=x^\\star} < 0$.\n$$\n\\frac{dg(x)}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( -r \\frac{x-\\theta}{\\sigma_K^2} \\right) = -\\frac{r}{\\sigma_K^2}\n$$\nSince $r>0$ and $\\sigma_K>0$, $\\frac{dg(x)}{dx} < 0$ for all $x$. Thus, the singular strategy $x^{\\star}=\\theta$ is always convergence stable.\n\nThe problem asks for the critical threshold $\\rho^{\\star} = \\sigma_{\\alpha}/\\sigma_K$ where the singular point transitions from evolutionarily stable to evolutionarily unstable, while remaining ecologically and convergence stable. We have established that it is always ecologically and convergence stable. The transition in evolutionary stability occurs when the second derivative of fitness is zero:\n$$\nr \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sigma_K^2} - \\frac{1}{\\sigma_\\alpha^2} \\right) = 0\n$$\nThis implies $\\sigma_K^2 = \\sigma_\\alpha^2$, and since the standard deviations are positive, $\\sigma_K = \\sigma_\\alpha$.\nThe dimensionless ratio $\\rho = \\sigma_{\\alpha}/\\sigma_K$ at this threshold is:\n$$\n\\rho^{\\star} = \\frac{\\sigma_\\alpha}{\\sigma_K} = 1\n$$\nFor $\\rho > 1$, the singular point is an ESS. For $\\rho < 1$, it is evolutionarily unstable and represents a branch point. The transition occurs at $\\rho = 1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2481921"}]}
