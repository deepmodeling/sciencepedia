First, we distribute $I_{0}$ on the left-hand side:\n$$\nI_{0} - \\frac{I_{0}}{P}S^{*} = \\epsilon A^{-\\gamma} S^{*}\n$$\nNext, we gather all terms containing $S^{*}$ on one side of the equation:\n$$\nI_{0} = \\epsilon A^{-\\gamma} S^{*} + \\frac{I_{0}}{P}S^{*}\n$$\nFactor out the common term $S^{*}$:\n$$\nI_{0} = S^{*} \\left( \\epsilon A^{-\\gamma} + \\frac{I_{0}}{P} \\right)\n$$\nFinally, we isolate $S^{*}$ to obtain the general analytical expression for the equilibrium species richness:\n$$\nS^{*} = \\frac{I_{0}}{\\epsilon A^{-\\gamma} + \\frac{I_{0}}{P}}\n$$\nThis expression can be algebraically simplified by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $P$:\n$$\nS^{*} = \\frac{I_{0}P}{P\\left(\\epsilon A^{-\\gamma} + \\frac{I_{0}}{P}\\right)} = \\frac{I_{0}P}{P\\epsilon A^{-\\gamma} + I_{0}}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for $S^{*}$.\n\nNow, we must evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values:\n- Mainland species pool size, $P = 200$.\n- Maximum immigration rate, $I_{0} = 20$ species/year.\n- Baseline extinction-rate parameter, $\\epsilon = 0.1$ year$^{-1}$.\n- Area-scaling exponent, $\\gamma = 0.5$.\n- Island area, $A = 100$ km$^2$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the per-species extinction rate, which is the coefficient of $S$ in the extinction function, $\\epsilon A^{-\\gamma}$:\n$$\n\\epsilon A^{-\\gamma} = (0.1) \\times (100)^{-0.5}\n$$\nSince an exponent of $-0.5$ is equivalent to taking the reciprocal of the square root, we have:\n$$\n(100)^{-0.5} = \\frac{1}{100^{0.5}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{100}} = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1\n$$\nTherefore, the per-species extinction rate is:\n$$\n\\epsilon A^{-\\gamma} = 0.1 \\times 0.1 = 0.01 \\text{ year}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, we substitute all numerical values into the expression for $S^{*}$:\n$$\nS^{*} = \\frac{(20)(200)}{(200)(0.01) + 20}\n$$\n$$\nS^{*} = \\frac{4000}{2 + 20}\n$$\n$$\nS^{*} = \\frac{4000}{22}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\nS^{*} = \\frac{2000}{11} \\approx 181.8181...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

It is a standard application of a well-established scientific model. I will proceed with the derivation.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nFirst, we must establish the mathematical forms of the immigration and extinction rate functions based on the given linear constraints.\n\nThe immigration rate $I(S)$ is a linear function passing through the points $(0, I_{0})$ and $(P, 0)$. The slope of this line is $(0 - I_{0}) / (P - 0) = -I_{0}/P$. The y-intercept is $I_{0}$. Therefore, the function is:\n$$I(S) = I_{0} - \\frac{I_{0}}{P}S = I_{0} \\left(1 - \\frac{S}{P}\\right)$$\n\nThe extinction rate $E(S)$ is a linear function passing through the points $(0, 0)$ and $(P, E_{0})$. The slope of this line is $(E_{0} - 0) / (P - 0) = E_{0}/P$. The y-intercept is $0$. Therefore, the function is:\n$$E(S) = \\frac{E_{0}}{P}S$$\n\nThe equilibrium species richness, $S^{*}$, is found by setting $I(S^{*}) = E(S^{*})$:\n$$I_{0} \\left(1 - \\frac{S^{*}}{P}\\right) = \\frac{E_{0}}{P}S^{*}$$\nTo solve for $S^{*}$, we can first eliminate $P$ by multiplying through:\n$$I_{0}(P - S^{*}) = E_{0}S^{*}$$\n$$I_{0}P - I_{0}S^{*} = E_{0}S^{*}$$\nNow, we collect terms involving $S^{*}$:\n$$I_{0}P = (I_{0} + E_{0})S^{*}$$\nFinally, we isolate $S^{*}$:\n$$S^{*} = \\frac{I_{0}P}{I_{0} + E_{0}}$$\nThis equation can be rearranged into a more convenient form for analysis:\n$$S^{*} = P \\left( \\frac{I_{0}}{I_{0} + E_{0}} \\right) = P \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + E_{0}/I_{0}} \\right)$$\n\nNext, we analyze the effect of the specified changes in landscape structure.\nLet the initial state be denoted by subscript $1$ and the final state by subscript $2$.\nInitial conditions: Area $A_{1} = A$, Distance $d_{1} = d$. This gives rates $I_{0,1} = I_{0}(d)$ and $E_{0,1} = E_{0}(A)$.\nFinal conditions: Area $A_{2} = A/2$, Distance $d_{2} = 2d$. This gives rates $I_{0,2} = I_{0}(2d)$ and $E_{0,2} = E_{0}(A/2)$.\n\nWe are given the following qualitative relationships:\n1.  $I_{0}$ is a decreasing function of distance $d$. Since $d_{2} > d_{1}$, it follows that $I_{0}(d_{2}) < I_{0}(d_{1})$, or $I_{0,2} < I_{0,1}$. The maximum immigration rate decreases.\n2.  $E_{0}$ is a decreasing function of area $A$. Since $A_{2} < A_{1}$, it follows that $E_{0}(A_{2}) > E_{0}(A_{1})$, or $E_{0,2} > E_{0,1}$. The maximum extinction rate increases.\n\nNow we analyze the change in $S^{*}$ using the derived expression $S^{*} = P / (1 + E_{0}/I_{0})$.\nLet us examine the ratio $R = E_{0}/I_{0}$.\nThe initial ratio is $R_{1} = E_{0,1}/I_{0,1}$.\nThe final ratio is $R_{2} = E_{0,2}/I_{0,2}$.\n\nWe have established that $E_{0,2} > E_{0,1}$ and $I_{0,2} < I_{0,1}$. Since all these quantities are positive, the numerator of the ratio $R$ increases while the denominator decreases. Both of these effects cause the ratio to increase. Therefore, it is unambiguous that:\n$$R_{2} = \\frac{E_{0,2}}{I_{0,2}} > \\frac{E_{0,1}}{I_{0,1}} = R_{1}$$\nThe ratio of the maximum extinction rate to the maximum immigration rate increases.\n\nNow, we consider the full expression for $S^{*}$:\n$$S^{*} = \\frac{P}{1 + R}$$\nSince $P$ is constant and $R$ increases (from $R_{1}$ to $R_{2}$), the denominator $(1+R)$ increases. An increase in the denominator of a positive fraction leads to a decrease in the value of the fraction. Thus, we have:\n$$S^{*}_{2} = \\frac{P}{1 + R_{2}} < \\frac{P}{1 + R_{1}} = S^{*}_{1}$$\nThe equilibrium species richness $S^{*}$ must decrease.\n\nThis conclusion is robust and does not depend on the specific functional forms of $I_{0}(d)$ and $E_{0}(A)$, only on their monotonically decreasing nature. The direction of change is therefore determinate.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. $S^{*}$ increases.\n**Incorrect**. My derivation demonstrates that both the decrease in patch area and the increase in isolation distance contribute to a lower equilibrium species richness. The former increases the extinction rate, while the latter decreases the immigration rate. Both effects push $S^{*}$ to a lower value.\n\nB. $S^{*}$ decreases.\n**Correct**. As shown in the derivation, the decrease in area $A$ causes an increase in the maximum extinction rate $E_{0}$, and the increase in distance $d$ causes a decrease in the maximum immigration rate $I_{0}$. Both of these changes result in a lower value for the equilibrium species richness $S^{*}$. The combination of these effects is an unambiguous decrease in $S^{*}$.\n\nC. $S^{*}$ remains unchanged.\n**Incorrect**. For $S^{*}$ to remain unchanged, the ratio $E_{0}/I_{0}$ would need to remain constant. However, since $E_{0}$ increases and $I_{0}$ decreases, this ratio must strictly increase, causing $S^{*}$ to decrease.\n\nD. The direction of change in $S^{*}$ is indeterminate without specifying elasticities of $I_{0}$ and $E_{0}$ with respect to $d$ and $A$.\n**Incorrect**. The direction of change is determinate. Indeterminacy would arise if the two effects (change in area and change in distance) opposed each other. For example, if both area and distance increased, $E_0$ would decrease and $I_0$ would decrease. In this case, the change in the ratio $E_0/I_0$ would be ambiguous without knowing the relative magnitudes of the changes (i.e., the elasticities). In the present problem, however, both effects work in the same direction—to reduce $S^{*}$.

This corresponds to the point where the number of species has moved halfway from its initial value, $S(0)$, to its new equilibrium value, $S_{\\mathrmeq}^{(\\mathrm{new})}$. Mathematically, this is when the remaining debt is half of the initial debt:\n$$ S(t_{50}) - S_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{(\\mathrm{new})} = \\frac{1}{2}(S(0) - S_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{(\\mathrm{new})}) $$\nSubstituting this into the solution of the ODE:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}(S(0) - S_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{(\\mathrm{new})}) = (S(0) - S_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{(\\mathrm{new})}) \\exp(-kt_{50}) $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-kt_{50}) $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -kt_{50} $$\n$$ -\\ln(2) = -kt_{50} $$\n$$ t_{50} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k} = \\frac{\\ln(2) P}{I_{0}^{(\\mathrm{new})} + E_{0}^{(\\mathrm{new})}} $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values for the post-change parameters: $P = 800$, $I_{0}^{(\\mathrm{new})} = 30\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, and $E_{0}^{(\\mathrm{new})} = 60\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$.\n$$ t_{50} = \\frac{\\ln(2) \\times 800}{30 + 60} = \\frac{800 \\ln(2)}{90} = \\frac{80 \\ln(2)}{9} $$\nNumerically, $t_{50} \\approx \\frac{80 \\times 0.693147}{9} \\approx \\frac{55.45177}{9} \\approx 6.1613\\,\\mathrm{years}$. Rounded to four significant figures, $t_{50}$ is $6.161$.\n\nThe two requested quantities are:\n$D_{\\mathrm{ext}} = 266.7$ species.\n$t_{50} = 6.161$ years.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n266.7 & 6.161\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2500791"}]}
