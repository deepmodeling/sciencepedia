The proportion of a patch considered to be an edge habitat is not constant but depends critically on the patch's size and the complexity of its shape. This practice provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for quantifying this relationship, connecting the core geometric properties of area and perimeter to the ecological concept of the edge effect.

It is a standard problem in mathematical biology.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe problem has four parts, which we will address in sequence.\n\nPart 1: Edge Effect for Smooth, Rectifiable Boundaries\nThe edge-affected zone is defined as the set of points within the patch $S$ that lie at a distance no greater than $w$ from the boundary $\\partial S$. This corresponds to the set-theoretic difference between the original patch $S$ and its morphological erosion by a disk of radius $w$, denoted $B_w$. The erosion is the inner parallel set, $S \\ominus B_w = \\{x \\in S \\mid B_w(x) \\subseteq S\\}$. The area of the edge zone is thus $E(w) = A - \\text{Area}(S \\ominus B_w)$.\n\nThe problem alludes to Steiner's formula for the area of an *outward* parallel set (Minkowski dilation). The full Steiner's theorem for a convex set $K$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ also provides the area of the *inner* parallel set (erosion) for a small distance $w$. The formula is:\n$$\n\\text{Area}(K \\ominus B_w) = A - Pw + \\pi w^2\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the area of $K$ and $P$ is its perimeter. This formula is exact for any convex set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, including those with corners like a square, not just sets with smooth boundaries. The problem's mention of smoothness justifies retaining the $w^2$ term, which is related to the total curvature of the boundary ($2\\pi$ for any simple closed curve, hence the $\\pi w^2$ term).\n\nUsing this theorem, we find the area of the edge-affected zone to be:\n$$\nE(w) = A - (A - Pw + \\pi w^2) = Pw - \\pi w^2\n$$\nThe proportion of the patch affected by edges is therefore:\n$$\nf(w) = \\frac{E(w)}{A} = \\frac{Pw - \\pi w^2}{A} = \\frac{P}{A}w - \\frac{\\pi}{A}w^2\n$$\nThis expression is valid up to order $w^2$.\n\nPart 2: Application to Simple Geometries\nWe apply the derived principles to a circle and a square.\n\nFor a circle of radius $R$:\nThe area is $A = \\pi R^2$ and the perimeter is $P = 2\\pi R$. The condition on $w$ is $w < R$. The inner parallel set is a concentric circle of radius $R-w$.\nThe area of the edge zone is the difference in areas:\n$$\nE(w) = A_{\\text{circle}}(R) - A_{\\text{circle}}(R-w) = \\pi R^2 - \\pi(R-w)^2 = \\pi R^2 - \\pi(R^2 - 2Rw + w^2) = 2\\pi Rw - \\pi w^2\n$$\nThe proportion is:\n$$\nf(w) = \\frac{E(w)}{A} = \\frac{2\\pi Rw - \\pi w^2}{\\pi R^2} = \\frac{2}{R}w - \\frac{1}{R^2}w^2\n$$\nThe ratio $P/A = (2\\pi R) / (\\pi R^2) = 2/R$. The leading-order term in $f(w)$ is $(P/A)w = (2/R)w$, which is consistent with our general derivation.\n\nFor a square of side length $L$:\nThe area is $A = L^2$ and the perimeter is $P = 4L$. The condition on $w$ is $w < L/2$. The square is a convex set, so we can apply the result from Part 1 directly.\n$$\nE(w) = Pw - \\pi w^2 = 4Lw - \\pi w^2\n$$\nThe proportion is:\n$$\nf(w) = \\frac{E(w)}{A} = \\frac{4Lw - \\pi w^2}{L^2} = \\frac{4}{L}w - \\frac{\\pi}{L^2}w^2\n$$\nThe ratio $P/A = (4L)/(L^2) = 4/L$. The leading-order dependence is again $(P/A)w = (4/L)w$. This demonstrates that for rectifiable boundaries, the primary determinant of the fractional edge effect for small $w$ is the perimeter-to-area ratio.\n\nPart 3: Edge Effect for Fractal Boundaries\nFor a boundary $\\partial S$ with Minkowski-Bouligand dimension $D \\in (1, 2)$, the concept of a finite perimeter $P$ is not applicable. Instead, the \"length\" of the boundary is scale-dependent, given as $P(\\varepsilon) \\asymp C_D \\varepsilon^{1-D}$, where $C_D$ is the $D$-dimensional Minkowski content.\n\nThe edge-affected area $E(w)$ corresponds to the area of the $w$-neighborhood of the boundary, also known as the Minkowski sausage. The area of such a neighborhood can be estimated by considering a minimal cover of the boundary $\\partial S$ by disks (or boxes) of size $w$.\nThe number of such disks, $N(w)$, needed to cover a set of dimension $D$, scales as:\n$$\nN(w) \\asymp \\text{const} \\cdot w^{-D}\n$$\nThe perimeter scaling $P(\\varepsilon) \\sim N(\\varepsilon)\\varepsilon$ implies $C_D \\varepsilon^{1-D} \\sim (N(\\varepsilon)\\varepsilon)$, which connects $N(w)$ to $C_D$. Specifically, $N(w) \\asymp C_D w^{-D}$.\nThe area of the edge zone $E(w)$ is approximately the number of covering disks multiplied by the area of each disk, which is proportional to $w^2$.\n$$\nE(w) \\approx N(w) \\times (\\text{Area of a } w\\text{-disk}) \\asymp (C_D w^{-D}) (\\pi w^2)\n$$\nIgnoring dimensionless constants of order unity, the scaling relationship is:\n$$\nE(w) \\asymp C_D w^{2-D}\n$$\nThe dimensional consistency is checked: $[C_D] = [\\text{Length}]^D$ from the definition of $P(\\varepsilon)$, so $[E(w)] = [\\text{Length}]^D \\times [\\text{Length}]^{2-D} = [\\text{Length}]^2$, which is correct for an area.\n\nThe fractional edge area $f(w)$ for a fractal boundary therefore scales as:\n$$\nf(w) = \\frac{E(w)}{A} \\asymp \\frac{C_D}{A} w^{2-D}\n$$\n\nPart 4: Consolidation of Regimes\nThe final task is to create a single parametric expression for the leading-order dependence of $f(w)$ that covers both rectifiable and fractal boundaries.\n\nCase 1: Rectifiable boundary. Here, $D=1$. The leading-order term from Part 1 is $f(w) \\asymp \\frac{P}{A}w$.\nCase 2: Fractal boundary. Here, $1 < D < 2$. The result from Part 3 is $f(w) \\asymp \\frac{C_D}{A} w^{2-D}$.\n\nWe observe that the fractal scaling law can be extended to the rectifiable case. If we set $D=1$ in the fractal formula, we get:\n$$\nf(w) \\asymp \\frac{C_1}{A} w^{2-1} = \\frac{C_1}{A} w\n$$\nFrom the definition $P(\\varepsilon) \\asymp C_D \\varepsilon^{1-D}$, setting $D=1$ gives $P(\\varepsilon) \\asymp C_1 \\varepsilon^0 = C_1$. This means that for a rectifiable curve, the measured perimeter becomes independent of the ruler size $\\varepsilon$ for small $\\varepsilon$, and this limit is the true perimeter, $P$. Thus, we can identify $C_1 = P$. The fractal formula correctly reproduces the leading term of the rectifiable case.\n\nTherefore, the scaling behavior for $D \\in [1, 2)$ can be unified. We are asked to introduce two parameters, $K$ and $\\beta$. We propose the general form for the leading-order dependence:\n$$\nf(w) = \\frac{K}{A} w^{\\beta}\n$$\nBy comparing this to our derived scaling laws, we define the parameters as follows:\n- The parameter $K$ is the generalized perimeter constant, equal to the $D$-dimensional Minkowski content of the boundary, $C_D$. For $D=1$, $K=P$, the standard perimeter. For $1 < D < 2$, $K=C_D$, the prefactor in the fractal perimeter scaling. Its physical dimension is $[\\text{Length}]^D$.\n- The parameter $\\beta$ is the edge-scaling exponent, defined as $\\beta = 2 - D$, where $D$ is the Minkowski-Bouligand dimension of the boundary. For a rectifiable boundary ($D=1$), $\\beta=1$, yielding a linear dependence on $w$. For a fractal boundary ($1 < D < 2$), the exponent is sub-linear, $0 < \\beta < 1$.\n\nThis single expression encapsulates the dominant, first-order relationship between habitat patch morphology and the extent of edge effects across a spectrum of boundary complexities.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{K}{A} w^{\\beta}}\n$$", "id": "2530870"}, {"introduction": "Ecological systems are inherently heterogeneous, with resources and conditions varying across the landscape. When a biological process, such as population growth, responds nonlinearly to an environmental driver, the average outcome across the landscape is not simply the outcome evaluated at the average environmental condition.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe first task is to derive a general second-order approximation for the landscape-level growth rate $G = \\mathrm{E}[f(X)]$. We begin with a second-order Taylor series expansion of the function $f(X)$ around the mean value $X = \\mu$.\n$$\nf(X) \\approx f(\\mu) + f'(\\mu)(X-\\mu) + \\frac{1}{2}f''(\\mu)(X-\\mu)^2\n$$\nThis approximation is valid for values of $X$ in a neighborhood of $\\mu$ and neglects terms of order three and higher. The landscape-level growth rate $G$ is the expected value of $f(X)$. We apply the expectation operator $\\mathrm{E}[\\cdot]$ to both sides of the approximation.\n$$\nG = \\mathrm{E}[f(X)] \\approx \\mathrm{E}\\left[f(\\mu) + f'(\\mu)(X-\\mu) + \\frac{1}{2}f''(\\mu)(X-\\mu)^2\\right]\n$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, we can distribute the operator across the terms.\n$$\nG \\approx \\mathrm{E}[f(\\mu)] + \\mathrm{E}[f'(\\mu)(X-\\mu)] + \\mathrm{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}f''(\\mu)(X-\\mu)^2\\right]\n$$\nThe terms $f(\\mu)$, $f'(\\mu)$, and $f''(\\mu)$ are constants because they are derivatives of the function $f$ evaluated at the specific point $\\mu$. Therefore, they can be factored out of the expectation.\n$$\nG \\approx f(\\mu) + f'(\\mu)\\mathrm{E}[X-\\mu] + \\frac{1}{2}f''(\\mu)\\mathrm{E}[(X-\\mu)^2]\n$$\nWe now evaluate the expectation terms. By definition, the expectation of the deviation from the mean is zero:\n$$\n\\mathrm{E}[X-\\mu] = \\mathrm{E}[X] - \\mathrm{E}[\\mu] = \\mu - \\mu = 0\n$$\nThe expectation of the squared deviation from the mean is the definition of variance:\n$$\n\\mathrm{E}[(X-\\mu)^2] = \\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\sigma^2\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $G$ yields the second-order approximation:\n$$\nG \\approx f(\\mu) + f'(\\mu) \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{2}f''(\\mu)\\sigma^2\n$$\n$$\nG \\approx f(\\mu) + \\frac{1}{2}f''(\\mu)\\sigma^2\n$$\nThis result demonstrates that the landscape-level mean growth rate $G$ deviates from the growth rate at the mean environment, $f(\\mu)$, by a term proportional to the environmental variance $\\sigma^2$ and the curvature of the response function at the mean, $f''(\\mu)$.\n\nNext, we apply this general result to the specific function $f(x) = \\alpha \\frac{x}{K+x}$. To do this, we must compute the first and second derivatives of $f(x)$.\nThe function is $f(x) = \\alpha x (K+x)^{-1}$.\nThe first derivative, using the product rule, is:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\alpha x (K+x)^{-1} \\right] = \\alpha \\left[ 1 \\cdot (K+x)^{-1} + x \\cdot (-1)(K+x)^{-2} \\right] = \\alpha \\left[ \\frac{1}{K+x} - \\frac{x}{(K+x)^2} \\right]\n$$\n$$\nf'(x) = \\alpha \\left[ \\frac{(K+x)-x}{(K+x)^2} \\right] = \\frac{\\alpha K}{(K+x)^2}\n$$\nThe second derivative is found by differentiating $f'(x) = \\alpha K (K+x)^{-2}$:\n$$\nf''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\alpha K (K+x)^{-2} \\right] = \\alpha K \\left[ -2(K+x)^{-3} \\cdot 1 \\right] = -\\frac{2\\alpha K}{(K+x)^3}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate $f(x)$ and $f''(x)$ at $x=\\mu$:\n$$\nf(\\mu) = \\frac{\\alpha \\mu}{K+\\mu}\n$$\n$$\nf''(\\mu) = -\\frac{2\\alpha K}{(K+\\mu)^3}\n$$\nSubstituting these into our approximation for $G$:\n$$\nG \\approx \\frac{\\alpha \\mu}{K+\\mu} + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( -\\frac{2\\alpha K}{(K+\\mu)^3} \\right) \\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\alpha \\mu}{K+\\mu} - \\frac{\\alpha K \\sigma^2}{(K+\\mu)^3}\n$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values: $\\alpha = 3$, $K = 4$, $\\mu = 5$, and $\\sigma^2 = 4$.\nFirst, calculate $f(\\mu)$:\n$$\nf(\\mu) = \\frac{3 \\cdot 5}{4+5} = \\frac{15}{9} = \\frac{5}{3}\n$$\nNext, calculate the correction term, $\\frac{1}{2}f''(\\mu)\\sigma^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}f''(\\mu)\\sigma^2 = -\\frac{\\alpha K \\sigma^2}{(K+\\mu)^3} = -\\frac{3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4}{(4+5)^3} = -\\frac{48}{9^3} = -\\frac{48}{729}\n$$\nSimplifying the fraction $\\frac{48}{729}$ by dividing numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $3$, gives $\\frac{16}{243}$. So the correction term is $-\\frac{16}{243}$.\nNow, we compute the approximation for $G$:\n$$\nG \\approx \\frac{5}{3} - \\frac{16}{243} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 81}{3 \\cdot 81} - \\frac{16}{243} = \\frac{405}{243} - \\frac{16}{243} = \\frac{389}{243}\n$$\nTo obtain the numerical value rounded to four significant figures:\n$$\nG \\approx \\frac{389}{243} \\approx 1.600823045...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $1.601$.\n\nFinally, we determine if environmental heterogeneity increases or decreases $G$ relative to $f(\\mu)$. The difference is given by the term $\\frac{1}{2}f''(\\mu)\\sigma^2$. Since variance $\\sigma^2$ is non-negative, the sign of the effect is determined by the sign of the curvature, $f''(\\mu)$.

The values at these centroids are denoted $X^{(f)}_{i}$.\n- An aggregation scheme where each $2 \\times 2$ block of fine cells forms one coarse unit.\n- The aggregated value for a coarse unit $\\alpha$ is the arithmetic mean: $X^{(c)}_{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{i \\in \\alpha} X^{(f)}_{i}$.\n- Moran's I statistic is defined as $I = \\frac{n}{S_{0}} \\frac{\\sum_{i}\\sum_{j} w_{ij}(y_{i}-\\bar{y})(y_{j}-\\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i}(y_{i}-\\bar{y})^{2}}$.\n- Assumption: The number of units, $n$, is large, so boundary effects are negligible and the sample mean $\\bar{y}$ can be replaced by the true mean, which is $0$.\n- Fine-scale weights $w^{(f)}_{ij}$: $1$ for first-order rook contiguity (neighbors at distance $\\ell$), $0$ otherwise.\n- Coarse-scale weights $w^{(c)}_{\\alpha\\beta}$: $1$ for first-order rook contiguity on the coarse lattice (neighbors whose centroids are at distance $2\\ell$), $0$ otherwise.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, operating within the established framework of geostatistics and spatial analysis. The concepts of Gaussian random fields, exponential covariance functions, spatial aggregation (MAUP), and Moran's I are standard in this discipline. The problem is well-posed; it provides all necessary definitions, parameters, and simplifying assumptions (infinite lattice, zero mean) required to derive a unique analytical solution. The language is objective and mathematically precise. The problem does not violate any principles of scientific or logical soundness, is not incomplete, and poses a non-trivial challenge in deriving the scale-dependent properties of the statistic.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be constructed.\n\nUnder the assumption of a large lattice and zero mean, the expression for the expected value of Moran's $I$ for a stationary process simplifies. The denominator, $\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i}(y_{i}-\\bar{y})^{2}$, becomes a consistent estimator of the process variance, $\\operatorname{Var}(Y)$. The numerator involves a sum of covariances. For a stationary process on a regular lattice, the expectation of Moran's $I$ is well-approximated by the ratio of the covariance between neighboring units to the variance of a single unit.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[I] \\approx \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(Y_i, Y_j)}{\\operatorname{Var}(Y_i)} $$\nwhere $i$ and $j$ are neighboring units as defined by the weight matrix.\n\n**1. Expected Fine-Scale Moran's $I$**\nAt the fine scale, the areal units are the cell centroids. The observations are $y_i = X^{(f)}_i$.\nThe variance of an observation is given by the covariance function at distance $h=0$:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(X^{(f)}_i) = C(0) = \\sigma^2 \\exp(-0/\\rho) = \\sigma^2 $$\nThe neighbors are defined by first-order rook contiguity, so they are at a Euclidean distance of $h=\\ell$. The covariance between two such neighbors is:\n$$ \\operatorname{Cov}(X^{(f)}_i, X^{(f)}_j) = C(\\ell) = \\sigma^2 \\exp(-\\ell/\\rho) $$\nThe expected fine-scale Moran's $I$ is therefore the ratio of these two quantities:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[I_{\\text{fine}}] = \\frac{C(\\ell)}{C(0)} = \\frac{\\sigma^2 \\exp(-\\ell/\\rho)}{\\sigma^2} = \\exp(-\\ell/\\rho) $$\n\n**2. Expected Coarse-Scale Moran's $I$**\nAt the coarse scale, the observations are the aggregated values $X^{(c)}_{\\alpha}$. We must first find the variance of a coarse unit and the covariance between adjacent coarse units.\n\nA coarse unit $\\alpha$ is the average of four fine-scale values, $X^{(f)}_{1}, X^{(f)}_{2}, X^{(f)}_{3}, X^{(f)}_{4}$, which form a $2 \\times 2$ block. The distances between the centroids of these fine cells are $\\ell$ (for $4$ pairs) and $\\ell\\sqrt{2}$ (for $2$ pairs).\nThe variance of a coarse unit is:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(X^{(c)}_{\\alpha}) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{i=1}^{4} X^{(f)}_{i}\\right) = \\frac{1}{16} \\sum_{i=1}^{4}\\sum_{j=1}^{4} \\operatorname{Cov}(X^{(f)}_{i}, X^{(f)}_{j}) $$\nThe sum of the $16$ covariance terms is:\n$4$ terms with distance $h=0$: $4 C(0) = 4\\sigma^2$\n$8$ terms with distance $h=\\ell$: $8 C(\\ell) = 8\\sigma^2\\exp(-\\ell/\\rho)$\n$4$ terms with distance $h=\\ell\\sqrt{2}$: $4 C(\\ell\\sqrt{2}) = 4\\sigma^2\\exp(-\\ell\\sqrt{2}/\\rho)$\nThus, the variance is:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(X^{(c)}_{\\alpha}) = \\frac{1}{16} \\left( 4\\sigma^2 + 8\\sigma^2\\exp(-\\ell/\\rho) + 4\\sigma^2\\exp(-\\ell\\sqrt{2}/\\rho) \\right) $$\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(X^{(c)}_{\\alpha}) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{4} \\left( 1 + 2\\exp(-\\ell/\\rho) + \\exp(-\\ell\\sqrt{2}/\\rho) \\right) $$\n\nNext, we calculate the covariance between two rook-adjacent coarse units, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. Let $\\alpha$ contain fine cells $\\{i_1, i_2, i_3, i_4\\}$ and $\\beta$ contain $\\{j_1, j_2, j_3, j_4\\}$. The covariance is:\n$$ \\operatorname{Cov}(X^{(c)}_{\\alpha}, X^{(c)}_{\\beta}) = \\operatorname{Cov}\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{k=1}^{4} X^{(f)}_{i_k}, \\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{m=1}^{4} X^{(f)}_{j_m}\\right) = \\frac{1}{16} \\sum_{k=1}^{4}\\sum_{m=1}^{4} \\operatorname{Cov}(X^{(f)}_{i_k}, X^{(f)}_{j_m}) $$\nThis requires summing $16$ cross-covariance terms, determined by the distances between the $4$ fine centroids in $\\alpha$ and the $4$ fine centroids in $\\beta$. By arranging the centroids on a coordinate grid, we find the following set of distances between the pairs:\n- $2$ pairs at distance $\\ell$\n- $2$ pairs at distance $\\ell\\sqrt{2}$\n- $4$ pairs at distance $2\\ell$\n- $4$ pairs at distance $\\ell\\sqrt{5}$\n- $2$ pairs at distance $3\\ell$\n- $2$ pairs at distance $\\ell\\sqrt{10}$\nThe sum of the covariances is therefore:\n$$ \\sum_{k,m} \\operatorname{Cov} = \\sigma^2 \\left( 2\\exp(-\\ell/\\rho) + 2\\exp(-\\ell\\sqrt{2}/\\rho) + 4\\exp(-2\\ell/\\rho) + 4\\exp(-\\ell\\sqrt{5}/\\rho) + 2\\exp(-3\\ell/\\rho) + 2\\exp(-\\ell\\sqrt{10}/\\rho) \\right) $$\nSo, the covariance between adjacent coarse units is:\n$$ \\operatorname{Cov}(X^{(c)}_{\\alpha}, X^{(c)}_{\\beta}) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{16} \\left( 2\\exp(-\\ell/\\rho) + 2\\exp(-\\ell\\sqrt{2}/\\rho) + 4\\exp(-2\\ell/\\rho) + 4\\exp(-\\ell\\sqrt{5}/\\rho) + 2\\exp(-3\\ell/\\rho) + 2\\exp(-\\ell\\sqrt{10}/\\rho) \\right) $$\nThe expected coarse-scale Moran's $I$ is the ratio of this covariance to the variance $\\operatorname{Var}(X^{(c)}_{\\alpha})$. The $\\sigma^2$ terms cancel.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[I_{\\text{coarse}}] = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(X^{(c)}_{\\alpha}, X^{(c)}_{\\beta})}{\\operatorname{Var}(X^{(c)}_{\\alpha})} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{16} \\left( \\dots \\right)}{\\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\dots \\right)} $$\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[I_{\\text{coarse}}] = \\frac{2\\exp(-\\ell/\\rho) + 2\\exp(-\\ell\\sqrt{2}/\\rho) + 4\\exp(-2\\ell/\\rho) + 4\\exp(-\\ell\\sqrt{5}/\\rho) + 2\\exp(-3\\ell/\\rho) + 2\\exp(-\\ell\\sqrt{10}/\\rho)}{4\\left( 1 + 2\\exp(-\\ell/\\rho) + \\exp(-\\ell\\sqrt{2}/\\rho) \\right)} $$\n\n**3. Change in Moran's $I$ due to Aggregation**\nThe change, $\\Delta I(\\ell,\\rho)$, is the difference between the expected coarse-scale and fine-scale Moran's $I$:\n$$ \\Delta I(\\ell, \\rho) = \\mathbb{E}[I_{\\text{coarse}}] - \\mathbb{E}[I_{\\text{fine}}] $$\nSubstituting the derived expressions gives the final analytical form.\n\n**Mechanistic Explanation for Hotspot Detection**\nThe sign of $\\Delta I(\\ell,\\rho)$ dictates whether aggregation inflates or deflates the measured spatial autocorrelation; a positive sign indicates that patterns of high-value clusters (hotspots) will appear more intense and spatially contiguous at the coarse scale. This occurs because aggregation acts as a spatial low-pass filter, averaging out local noise and enhancing the shared-signal component between adjacent aggregated units.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\frac{2\\exp(-\\frac{\\ell}{\\rho}) + 4\\exp(-\\frac{2\\ell}{\\rho}) + 2\\exp(-\\frac{3\\ell}{\\rho}) + 2\\exp(-\\frac{\\ell\\sqrt{2}}{\\rho}) + 4\\exp(-\\frac{\\ell\\sqrt{5}}{\\rho}) + 2\\exp(-\\frac{\\ell\\sqrt{10}}{\\rho})}{4\\left(1 + 2\\exp(-\\frac{\\ell}{\\rho}) + \\exp(-\\frac{\\ell\\sqrt{2}}{\\rho})\\right)} - \\exp(-\\frac{\\ell}{\\rho}) } $$", "id": "2530941"}]}
