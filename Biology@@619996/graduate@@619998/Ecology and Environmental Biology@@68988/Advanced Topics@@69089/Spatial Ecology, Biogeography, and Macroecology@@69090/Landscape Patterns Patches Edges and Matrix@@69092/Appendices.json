The checkerboard pattern is unambiguous. The conditions that $k$ is odd and $N$ is a multiple of $k$ are critical and ensure that the aggregation process is well-defined.

The use of the limit $N \\to \\infty$ standardizes the calculation by removing boundary effects of the overall landscape, leading to a unique solution.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, mathematical language, free from subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a formal, self-contained mathematical exercise. A solution will now be derived from first principles.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nLet us first analyze the state of the landscape *before* the aggregation operation.\n\n**1. Initial Landscape Metrics ($L_{\\text{before}}$ and $P_{\\text{before}}$)**\n\nThe landscape is an $N \\times N$ checkerboard.\nFor total edge length, $L_{\\text{before}}(N)$: An $N \\times N$ grid has $N(N-1)$ internal horizontal edges and $N(N-1)$ internal vertical edges, for a total of $2N(N-1)$ internal edges. In a perfect checkerboard, every pair of orthogonally adjacent cells belongs to a different class. Therefore, every internal cell boundary is an edge as defined. The length of each such boundary is $1$.\n$$L_{\\text{before}}(N) = N(N-1) + N(N-1) = 2N(N-1) = 2N^2 - 2N$$\nFor patch count, $P_{\\text{before}}(N)$: Patches are defined by $4$-connectivity. In a checkerboard pattern, a cell of a given class is surrounded orthogonally only by cells of the other class. Consequently, no two cells of the same class are $4$-connected. Each cell constitutes its own patch. The total number of cells is $N^2$.\n$$P_{\\text{before}}(N) = N^2$$\n\n**2. Aggregation Process Analysis**\n\nThe $N \\times N$ grid is partitioned into $(N/k)^2$ non-overlapping blocks, each of size $k \\times k$. Since $k$ is an odd integer, the total number of cells in a block, $k^2$, is also odd. Each block is a $k \\times k$ checkerboard. The number of cells of the two classes, $A$ and $B$, within any such block will be $\\frac{k^2+1}{2}$ and $\\frac{k^2-1}{2}$. The strict majority class is unequivocally the one with $\\frac{k^2+1}{2}$ cells. In a checkerboard of odd dimension, the class occupying the corners is the majority class.\n\nLet us determine the class of the resulting coarse cells. The coarse grid has dimensions $N' \\times N'$, where $N' = N/k$. Let the coarse cell at position $(I, J)$ correspond to the block whose top-left cell in the original grid is at $(i, j) = ((I-1)k+1, (J-1)k+1)$. The class of the aggregated coarse cell is determined by the majority class in this block, which is the class of the block's corner cells. The class of a corner cell, such as the top-left one at $(i,j)$, depends on the parity of the sum of its coordinates. Let us assume the cell at $(1,1)$ in the fine grid is class $A$. Then a cell at $(i,j)$ is class $A$ if $i+j$ is even, and class $B$ if $i+j$ is odd. The sum of coordinates for the top-left cell of block $(I,J)$ is:\n$$i+j = ((I-1)k+1) + ((J-1)k+1) = (I+J-2)k + 2$$\nSince $k$ is odd, $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$. The parity of the sum is:\n$$(I+J-2)k + 2 \\equiv (I+J-2)(1) + 0 \\pmod{2} \\equiv I+J \\pmod{2}$$\nThe parity of the sum of coordinates for the top-left cell of block $(I,J)$ is the same as the parity of $I+J$. This proves that if the original fine grid is a checkerboard, the resulting coarse grid is also a perfect checkerboard.\n\n**3. Post-Aggregation Landscape Metrics ($L_{\\text{after}}$ and $P_{\\text{after}}$)**\n\nThe new landscape is an $(N/k) \\times (N/k)$ checkerboard. Let $N' = N/k$. Each coarse cell has an edge length of $k$.\nFor total edge length, $L_{\\text{after}}(N,k)$: The coarse grid is an $N' \\times N'$ checkerboard. The number of internal boundaries is $2N'(N'-1)$. Each boundary is between two coarse cells, so its length is $k$.\n$$L_{\\text{after}}(N,k) = (2N'(N'-1)) \\times k = 2 \\frac{N}{k} \\left(\\frac{N}{k}-1\\right) k = 2N \\left(\\frac{N-k}{k}\\right) = \\frac{2N^2 - 2Nk}{k}$$\nFor patch count, $P_{\\text{after}}(N,k)$: The coarse grid is an $N' \\times N'$ checkerboard. By the same logic as for the initial landscape, each coarse cell is its own patch under $4$-connectivity. The total number of coarse cells is $(N')^2$.\n$$P_{\\text{after}}(N,k) = (N')^2 = \\left(\\frac{N}{k}\\right)^2 = \\frac{N^2}{k^2}$$\n\n**4. Asymptotic Reduction Factors ($c_{L}(k)$ and $c_{P}(k)$)**\n\nNow we compute the required limits.\nFor the edge length reduction factor:\n$$c_{L}(k) = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{L_{\\text{after}}(N,k)}{L_{\\text{before}}(N)} = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{(2N^2 - 2Nk)/k}{2N^2 - 2N} = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{2N(N-k)/k}{2N(N-1)} = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{N-k}{k(N-1)}$$\nDivide numerator and denominator by $N$:\n$$c_{L}(k) = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{1 - k/N}{k(1 - 1/N)} = \\frac{1 - 0}{k(1 - 0)} = \\frac{1}{k}$$\nFor the patch count reduction factor:\n$$c_{P}(k) = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{P_{\\text{after}}(N,k)}{P_{\\text{before}}(N)} = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{N^2/k^2}{N^2} = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{k^2} = \\frac{1}{k^2}$$\n\nThe resulting reduction factors are $c_{L}(k) = 1/k$ and $c_{P}(k) = 1/k^2$. The final answer is to be reported as a row vector.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{k} & \\frac{1}{k^2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2502089"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply counting patches and edges, understanding their spatial arrangement—whether clustered, random, or uniform—is crucial for inferring underlying ecological processes.

By comparing observed distributions to a null model of Complete Spatial Randomness (CSR) while properly handling edge effects, you will develop a key skill in quantitative landscape analysis [@problem_id:2502077].", "problem": "You are given sets of two-dimensional coordinates representing patch centroids within a closed rectangular landscape. Assume that patch centroids represent points of a point process in ecology, and that the underlying null hypothesis for spatial arrangement is Complete Spatial Randomness (CSR), modeled as a homogeneous Poisson process with constant intensity. Use a toroidal (periodic) distance metric to avoid edge bias by treating opposite edges of the rectangle as adjacent. Your task is to compute the nearest-neighbor distance distribution for each set, derive the appropriate Poisson expectation from first principles, and compare the observed mean to the expectation using the Clark–Evans statistic to infer aggregation or regularity.\n\nFundamental base and definitions you must employ:\n- Under CSR, points are independently and uniformly distributed over area $A$ with intensity $\\lambda = N/A$, where $N$ is the number of points.\n- The nearest-neighbor distance for a point is the Euclidean distance to its closest other point. For a rectangular domain of width $W$ and height $H$, the toroidal distance between points $(x_i,y_i)$ and $(x_j,y_j)$ is computed by taking wrapped coordinate differences: for each axis, use the minimum of the absolute difference and the complement to the box size, then compute the Euclidean norm. Explicitly, for each axis, the wrapped difference is $\\min\\left(|\\Delta|, L - |\\Delta|\\right)$ where $L$ is $W$ for the $x$-axis and $H$ for the $y$-axis.\n- Start from the probability of observing no points in a region under a homogeneous Poisson process and derive, from first principles, both the form of the nearest-neighbor distance distribution under CSR and its first two moments for a location at a point of the process on the infinite plane.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard problem in spatial point pattern analysis from the field of ecology, based on the established null hypothesis of Complete Spatial Randomness (CSR). All required data and definitions are provided, and the computational tasks are unambiguous. I will now proceed with the solution, which consists of two parts: the theoretical derivation from first principles and the computational implementation for the given test cases.\n\nFirst, we must derive the theoretical properties of the nearest-neighbor distance (NND) under CSR. The null model is a homogeneous Poisson point process with constant intensity $\\lambda = N/A$, where $N$ is the number of points in an area $A$.\n\nThe fundamental property of a homogeneous Poisson process is that the number of points, $k$, in any region of area $S$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda S$. The probability of observing $k$ points is given by:\n$$P(k) = \\frac{(\\lambda S)^k e^{-\\lambda S}}{k!}$$\n\nLet $R$ be the random variable representing the distance from an arbitrary point to its nearest neighbor. The event that this distance is greater than some value $r$ ($R > r$) is equivalent to the event that there are zero other points inside a disk of radius $r$ centered on the arbitrary point. The area of this disk is $S = \\pi r^2$.\n\nThe probability of having $k=0$ points in this disk is:\n$$P(R > r) = P(k=0) = \\frac{(\\lambda \\pi r^2)^0 e^{-\\lambda \\pi r^2}}{0!} = e^{-\\lambda \\pi r^2}$$\nThis expression is the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the NND, $R$. From this, we find the cumulative distribution function (CDF):\n$$F_R(r) = P(R \\le r) = 1 - P(R > r) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\pi r^2} \\quad \\text{for } r \\ge 0$$\nThe probability density function (PDF), $f_R(r)$, is the derivative of the CDF with respect to $r$:\n$$f_R(r) = \\frac{dF_R(r)}{dr} = 2 \\lambda \\pi r e^{-\\lambda \\pi r^2} \\quad \\text{for } r \\ge 0$$\nThis is the PDF of a Rayleigh distribution. We now derive its first two moments.\n\nThe expected value of $R$, which is the theoretical mean NND under CSR, is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[R] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r f_R(r) dr = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r (2 \\lambda \\pi r e^{-\\lambda \\pi r^2}) dr = 2 \\lambda \\pi \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r^2 e^{-\\lambda \\pi r^2} dr$$\nUsing the standard integral $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} x^2 e^{-ax^2} dx = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{4a^{3/2}}$ with $a = \\lambda \\pi$, we obtain:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[R] = 2 \\lambda \\pi \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{4(\\lambda \\pi)^{3/2}} \\right) = 2 \\lambda \\pi \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{4 \\lambda^{3/2} \\pi^{3/2}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\lambda}}$$\n\nNext, we derive the variance of $R$. We first compute the second moment, $\\mathbb{E}[R^2]$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[R^2] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r^2 f_R(r) dr = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r^2 (2 \\lambda \\pi r e^{-\\lambda \\pi r^2}) dr = 2 \\lambda \\pi \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r^3 e^{-\\lambda \\pi r^2} dr$$\nUsing integration by parts or substitution ($u=\\lambda\\pi r^2$), this integral evaluates to $\\frac{1}{2(\\lambda\\pi)^2}$.\n$$\\mathbb{E}[R^2] = 2 \\lambda \\pi \\left( \\frac{1}{2(\\lambda\\pi)^2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda \\pi}$$\nThe variance of $R$ is then $\\mathrm{Var}(R) = \\mathbb{E}[R^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[R])^2$:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(R) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda \\pi} - \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\lambda}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\lambda\\pi} - \\frac{1}{4\\lambda} = \\frac{4-\\pi}{4\\pi\\lambda}$$\n\nThe Clark–Evans $R$ statistic is the ratio of the observed mean NND, $\\bar{r}_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} r_i$, to the expected mean NND:\n$$R_{\\text{stat}} = \\frac{\\bar{r}_{\\text{obs}}}{\\mathbb{E}[R]}$$\nValues of $R_{\\text{stat}}  1$ suggest clustering (aggregation), $R_{\\text{stat}} > 1$ suggest dispersion (regularity), and $R_{\\text{stat}} \\approx 1$ suggests randomness.\n\nTo test for statistical significance, we construct a $Z$-score. The variance of the sample mean $\\bar{r}_{\\text{obs}}$ is required. Assuming the $N$ nearest-neighbor distances $r_i$ are independent and identically distributed (a standard simplification for this test), the variance of the sample mean is:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{r}_{\\text{obs}}) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(R)}{N} = \\frac{4-\\pi}{4\\pi N\\lambda}$$\nThe standard error of the mean is $\\mathrm{SE}(\\bar{r}_{\\text{obs}}) = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{r}_{\\text{obs}})}$. The $Z$-score is then:\n$$Z = \\frac{\\bar{r}_{\\text{obs}} - \\mathbb{E}[R]}{\\mathrm{SE}(\\bar{r}_{\\text{obs}})} = \\frac{\\bar{r}_{\\text{obs}} - \\mathbb{E}[R]}{\\sqrt{\\frac{4-\\pi}{4\\pi N\\lambda}}}$$\nThis $Z$-score is compared against the critical values of a standard normal distribution. For a two-sided test with significance level $\\alpha=0.05$, the critical value is $z_{0.975} \\approx 1.96$.\n- If $Z \\ge 1.96$, the pattern is regular (code $+1$).\n- If $Z \\le -1.96$, the pattern is aggregated (code $-1$).\n- Otherwise, the pattern is indistinguishable from CSR (code $0$).\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.  For each point $(x_i, y_i)$, calculate the toroidal distance to all other points $(x_j, y_j)$. The toroidal distance is $\\sqrt{d_x^2 + d_y^2}$, where $d_x = \\min(|x_i - x_j|, W - |x_i - x_j|)$ and $d_y = \\min(|y_i - y_j|, H - |y_i - y_j|)$.\n2.  Find the minimum of these distances for each point $i$ to get its NND, $r_i$.\n3.  Compute the observed mean NND, $\\bar{r}_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum r_i$.\n4.  Calculate the intensity $\\lambda = N / (W \\cdot H)$.\n5.  Calculate the theoretical mean $\\mathbb{E}[R]$ and $Z$-score using the derived formulas.\n6.  Determine the inference code $I$ based on the $Z$-score.\n\nA critical note on Case $4$: The use of a large-sample $Z$-score for a dataset with $N=2$ points is statistically inappropriate, as the Central Limit Theorem assumptions are grossly violated. The resulting $Z$-score and inference lack statistical validity. However, as the problem instructs the execution of the calculation, we perform it with this explicit caveat. The high variance of the estimate for small $N$ correctly reflects the low statistical power in such a scenario.\n\nAll calculations will be performed according to these derivations.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the spatial statistics problem for the given test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"W\": 10.0, \"H\": 10.0, \"coords\": np.array([\n                (1.25, 1.25), (1.25, 3.75), (1.25, 6.25), (1.25, 8.75),\n                (3.75, 1.25), (3.75, 3.75), (3.75, 6.25), (3.75, 8.75),\n                (6.25, 1.25), (6.25, 3.75), (6.25, 6.25), (6.25, 8.75),\n                (8.75, 1.25), (8.75, 3.75), (8.75, 6.25), (8.75, 8.75)\n            ])\n        },\n        {\n            \"W\": 10.0, \"H\": 10.0, \"coords\": np.array([\n                (5.00, 5.00), (4.90, 5.10), (5.10, 4.90), (4.95, 5.05), (5.05, 4.95),\n                (4.85, 5.00), (5.00, 4.85), (5.15, 5.00), (5.00, 5.15), (4.92, 4.92),\n                (5.08, 5.08), (4.88, 5.12), (5.12, 4.88), (4.80, 5.20), (5.20, 4.80),\n                (4.75, 4.95), (5.25, 5.05), (4.95, 4.75), (5.05, 5.25), (4.70, 5.10)\n            ])\n        },\n        {\n            \"W\": 10.0, \"H\": 10.0, \"coords\": np.array([\n                (0.73, 1.85), (2.10, 3.90), (7.85, 8.60), (4.20, 1.10), (9.30, 0.80),\n                (3.10, 7.40), (6.90, 2.50), (8.40, 3.30), (1.50, 8.20), (5.50, 5.50),\n                (2.90, 6.30), (7.20, 5.10), (0.80, 4.70), (9.00, 6.90), (4.80, 8.80),\n                (6.10, 9.20), (3.70, 0.60), (1.20, 2.40), (8.90, 1.80), (5.90, 3.90)\n            ])\n        },\n        {\n            \"W\": 10.0, \"H\": 10.0, \"coords\": np.array([\n                (1.00, 1.00), (9.00, 9.00)\n            ])\n        }\n    ]\n\n    def toroidal_distance(p1, p2, W, H):\n        \"\"\"Computes toroidal Euclidean distance between two points.\"\"\"\n        dx = np.abs(p1[0] - p2[0])\n        dy = np.abs(p1[1] - p2[1])\n        dx_tor = np.minimum(dx, W - dx)\n        dy_tor = np.minimum(dy, H - dy)\n        return np.sqrt(dx_tor**2 + dy_tor**2)\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        W, H, coords = case[\"W\"], case[\"H\"], case[\"coords\"]\n        N = coords.shape[0]\n\n        # 1.

This exercise bridges the gap between static pattern and population persistence by using metapopulation theory to optimize habitat placement. You will compute the 'metapopulation capacity' ($\\Lambda$) from a connectivity matrix and determine where to add a new patch to most effectively enhance landscape-wide viability, a task that exemplifies modern, model-driven conservation planning [@problem_id:2502110].", "problem": "You are given a set of existing habitat patches embedded in a non-habitat matrix. Each patch has a location and an area. The landscape is modeled using a distance-decay dispersal kernel on a two-dimensional plane. The metapopulation capacity, denoted by $\\Lambda$, is defined as the leading eigenvalue (spectral radius) of a symmetric, non-negative connectivity matrix that encodes pairwise colonization potential. Your task is to compute the change in metapopulation capacity, denoted by $\\Delta \\Lambda$, resulting from adding a single new patch at one of several candidate locations, and to identify the candidate that maximizes $\\Delta \\Lambda$.\n\nUse the following fundamental base:\n- In patch occupancy models under the incidence function framework, linearization of colonization-extinction dynamics near vanishing occupancy reduces to a linear operator on patch states, where persistence is governed by the spectral properties of a non-negative connectivity matrix.\n- For patches indexed by $i \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,n-1\\}$ with areas $A_i$ and coordinates $(x_i,y_i)$ in kilometers, define the pairwise Euclidean distances $d_{ij} = \\sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2}$ in kilometers.\n- Let $\\ell  0$ be the characteristic dispersal length in kilometers.

Define $\\Delta \\Lambda = \\Lambda' - \\Lambda$.\n- In the event of exact numerical ties in $\\Delta \\Lambda$ between multiple candidates, select the candidate with the smallest index in the candidate list.\n\nCompute and report, for each test case, the index of the candidate location that maximizes $\\Delta \\Lambda$ together with the corresponding $\\Delta \\Lambda$. Your program must:\n- Use kilometers for all distances and the dispersal length $\\ell$.\n- Compute eigenvalues using standard linear algebra; you may assume the principal eigenvalue is real and non-negative by the Perron–Frobenius theorem.\n- Round each reported $\\Delta \\Lambda$ to $6$ decimal places.\n- Produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element is a list of the form $[\\text{best\\_index}, \\Delta \\Lambda]$.\n\nTest suite:\n- Test case $1$ (general case):\n  - Existing patches ($n = 3$): $(x_0,y_0,A_0) = (0.0,0.0,4.0)$, $(x_1,y_1,A_1) = (5.0,0.0,1.0)$, $(x_2,y_2,A_2) = (0.0,6.0,1.5)$.\n  - Dispersal length: $\\ell = 5.0$.\n  - New patch area: $A_{\\text{new}} = 2.0$.\n  - Candidate locations (in order): $(2.0,2.0)$, $(10.0,10.0)$, $(0.0,0.0)$, $(3.0,0.0)$.\n- Test case $2$ (long-range dispersal and more patches):\n  - Existing patches ($n = 4$): $(x_0,y_0,A_0) = (0.0,0.0,2.0)$, $(x_1,y_1,A_1) = (10.0,0.0,3.0)$, $(x_2,y_2,A_2) = (0.0,12.0,1.0)$, $(x_3,y_3,A_3) = (8.0,8.0,2.5)$.\n  - Dispersal length: $\\ell = 50.0$.\n  - New patch area: $A_{\\text{new}} = 1.5$.\n  - Candidate locations (in order): $(30.0,30.0)$, $(5.0,5.0)$, $(100.0,100.0)$, $(10.0,10.0)$.\n- Test case $3$ (zero-area new patch boundary condition):\n  - Existing patches ($n = 2$): $(x_0,y_0,A_0) = (0.0,0.0,1.0)$, $(x_1,y_1,A_1) = (1.0,0.0,1.0)$.\n  - Dispersal length: $\\ell = 2.0$.\n  - New patch area: $A_{\\text{new}} = 0.0$.\n  - Candidate locations (in order): $(0.0,0.0)$, $(100.0,100.0)$, $(0.5,0.0)$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., \"[[i1,delta1],[i2,delta2],[i3,delta3]]\"). All $\\Delta \\Lambda$ values must be rounded to $6$ decimal places. The index must be an integer and the $\\Delta \\Lambda$ must be a floating-point number.", "solution": "The problem posed is a well-defined exercise in computational ecology, grounded in the established principles of metapopulation dynamics. Specifically, it uses a formulation derived from the incidence function model, where the long-term persistence of a spatially structured population is related to the metapopulation capacity, symbolized by $\\Lambda$. This quantity is defined as the dominant eigenvalue, or spectral radius, of a connectivity matrix $K$. Our objective is to evaluate the strategic placement of a new habitat patch by quantifying its contribution to this capacity.\n\nThe fundamental components of the model are as follows. A landscape consists of $n$ habitat patches, each described by its area $A_i$ and spatial coordinates $(x_i, y_i)$. Connectivity between any two distinct patches $i$ and $j$ is a function of their areas and the Euclidean distance $d_{ij} = \\sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2}$ separating them. The dispersal of organisms between patches is modeled by a distance-decay kernel, characterized by a length scale $\\ell$.\n\nThe connectivity matrix $K$ is an $n \\times n$ symmetric matrix whose elements are defined as:\n$$\nK_{ij} = \\begin{cases}\n(A_i A_j)^{1/2}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{d_{ij}}{\\ell}\\right)  \\text{if } i \\neq j \\\\\n0  \\text{if } i = j\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe metapopulation capacity $\\Lambda$ is the spectral radius of this matrix, $\\Lambda = \\rho(K)$. For a non-negative matrix such as $K$, the Perron-Frobenius theorem guarantees that its spectral radius is a real, non-negative eigenvalue. Since $K$ is also symmetric, all its eigenvalues are real, simplifying the computation.\n\nThe central task is to assess the impact of adding a single new patch of area $A_{\\text{new}}$ at a candidate location $(x,y)$. The introduction of this new patch, indexed as patch $n$, transforms the system into an $(n+1)$-patch landscape. This requires constructing an augmented $(n+1) \\times (n+1)$ connectivity matrix, which we denote as $K'$. The elements of $K'$ are computed using the same rule. The original $n \\times n$ submatrix corresponding to the existing patches remains unchanged. The new entries are in the $(n+1)$-th row and column, connecting the new patch to all pre-existing patches $i = 0, \\dots, n-1$:\n$$\nK'_{i,n} = K'_{n,i} = (A_i A_{\\text{new}})^{1/2}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{d_{i,\\text{new}}}{\\ell}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $d_{i,\\text{new}}$ is the distance between patch $i$ and the new patch. The new diagonal element is $K'_{n,n} = 0$.\n\nThe metapopulation capacity of the augmented system is $\\Lambda' = \\rho(K')$. The change in capacity, $\\Delta \\Lambda = \\Lambda' - \\Lambda$, serves as the metric for evaluating the benefit of adding the new patch. The optimal candidate location is the one that yields the maximum $\\Delta \\Lambda$.\n\nThe computational procedure is therefore as follows:\n$1$. For a given test case, first construct the initial $n \\times n$ matrix $K$ for the existing patches.\n$2$. Compute the eigenvalues of $K$. Since $K$ is real and symmetric, this is a standard numerical task. The largest eigenvalue is the initial metapopulation capacity, $\\Lambda$.\n$3$. Sequentially evaluate each candidate location. For each candidate:\n    a. Form the augmented set of $n+1$ patches.\n    b. Construct the corresponding $(n+1) \\times (n+1)$ connectivity matrix $K'$.\n    c. Compute the eigenvalues of $K'$ and identify its spectral radius, $\\Lambda'$.\n    d. Calculate the change, $\\Delta \\Lambda = \\Lambda' - \\Lambda$.\n$4$. After evaluating all candidates, identify the one that resulted in the greatest $\\Delta \\Lambda$. Adherence to the specified tie-breaking rule—selecting the candidate with the lowest index in case of a tie—is mandatory.\n$5$. The final result for the test case comprises the index of the optimal candidate and its corresponding $\\Delta \\Lambda$ value, rounded to the specified precision.\n\nThis systematic approach provides a quantitative and objective method for conservation planning, specifically for identifying locations where habitat restoration or creation would most effectively enhance the persistence of a metapopulation. The provided test cases, including the boundary condition of a new patch with zero area ($A_{\\text{new}} = 0$), will be solved by a direct implementation of this algorithm. In the case where $A_{\\text{new}} = 0$, the corresponding row and column of the augmented matrix $K'$ are zero vectors. This implies that the spectrum of $K'$ is the spectrum of $K$ combined with an eigenvalue of $0$, resulting in $\\Lambda' = \\Lambda$ and thus $\\Delta \\Lambda = 0$. This provides a useful logical check for the implementation.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_connectivity_matrix(patches, l_dispersal):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the connectivity matrix K for a given set of patches.\n\n    Args:\n        patches (list of tuples): A list where each tuple is (x, y, A).\n        l_dispersal (float): The characteristic dispersal length.\n\n    Returns:\n        numpy.ndarray: The symmetric connectivity matrix K.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(patches)\n    if n == 0:\n        return np.array([[]])\n    \n    K = np.zeros((n, n), dtype=np.float64)\n    patch_data = np.array(patches, dtype=np.float64)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            xi, yi, Ai = patch_data[i]\n            xj, yj, Aj = patch_data[j]\n            \n            # This check is for the edge case where a new patch is placed\n            # at the exact location of an existing patch.\n            if Ai == 0.0 or Aj == 0.0:\n                connectivity = 0.0\n            else:\n                dist = np.sqrt((xi - xj)**2 + (yi - yj)**2)\n                connectivity = np.sqrt(Ai * Aj) * np.exp(-dist / l_dispersal)\n            \n            K[i, j] = connectivity\n            K[j, i] = connectivity\n            \n    return K\n\ndef get_metapopulation_capacity(K):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the metapopulation capacity (spectral radius) of a connectivity matrix.\n\n    Args:\n        K (numpy.ndarray): The connectivity matrix.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The metapopulation capacity, Lambda.\n    \"\"\"\n    if K.shape[0] == 0:\n        return 0.0\n    # For real symmetric matrices, eigvalsh is efficient and returns sorted eigenvalues.\n    # The last eigenvalue is the largest one (spectral radius for non-negative K).\n    eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvalsh(K)\n    return eigenvalues[-1]\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the problem for all test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"existing_patches\": [(0.0, 0.0, 4.0), (5.0, 0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 6.0, 1.5)],\n            \"l_dispersal\": 5.0,\n            \"A_new\": 2.0,\n            \"candidates\": [(2.0, 2.0), (10.0, 10.0), (0.0, 0.0), (3.0, 0.0)],\n        },\n        {\n            \"existing_patches\": [(0.0, 0.0, 2.0), (10.0, 0.0, 3.0), (0.0, 12.0, 1.0), (8.0, 8.0, 2.5)],\n            \"l_dispersal\": 50.0,\n            \"A_new\": 1.5,\n            \"candidates\": [(30.0, 30.0), (5.0, 5.0), (100.0, 100.0), (10.0, 10.0)],\n        },\n        {\n            \"existing_patches\": [(0.0, 0.0, 1.0), (1.0, 0.0, 1.0)],\n            \"l_dispersal\": 2.0,\n            \"A_new\": 0.0,\n            \"candidates\": [(0.0, 0.0), (100.0, 100.0), (0.5, 0.0)],\n        },\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        existing_patches = case[\"existing_patches\"]\n        l_dispersal = case[\"l_dispersal\"]\n        A_new = case[\"A_new\"]\n        candidates = case[\"candidates\"]\n\n        # 1.
