It is a standard, tractable exercise in theoretical ecology. A solution will now be derived.\n\nWe begin with the governing differential equation for the occupancy probability of a single patch $i$:\n$$\n\\frac{d p_i}{d t} = c_i (1 - p_i) - e_i p_i\n$$\nThe problem requires finding the nontrivial steady-state occupancy, which we denote as $p^{\\ast}$. At steady state, $\\frac{d p_i}{d t} = 0$. Furthermore, the simplifying assumptions greatly reduce the complexity of the system.\n\nFirst, we simplify the extinction rate $e_i$. Given that all patches have identical area $A_i \\equiv A$, the extinction rate becomes uniform across all patches:\n$$\ne_i = e_0 A_i^{-\\gamma} \\equiv e_0 A^{-\\gamma} = e\n$$\n\nNext, we simplify the colonization rate $c_i$. The assumption of exchangeable equilibrium implies that at steady state, $p_i(t) \\equiv p$ for all patches $i$. The colonization rate for any patch $i$ is then:\n$$\nc_i = m \\sum_{j=1}^{N} p_j K_{ij}\n$$\nSubstituting $p_j = p$ for all $j$:\n$$\nc_i = m p \\sum_{j=1}^{N} K_{ij}\n$$\nThe sum is over the connectivity kernel elements. We are given that $K_{ij} = K$ for $i \\neq j$ and $K_{ii} = 0$. Therefore, the sum for any given patch $i$ consists of $N-1$ terms equal to $K$ and one term equal to $0$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{N} K_{ij} = \\sum_{j \\neq i, j=1}^{N} K + K_{ii} = (N-1)K + 0 = (N-1)K\n$$\nThus, the colonization rate is also uniform across all patches, and it depends on the overall occupancy level $p$:\n$$\nc_i \\equiv c = m p (N-1)K\n$$\nNow we can write the steady-state equation for any patch by setting $\\frac{dp}{dt} = 0$ and dropping the subscript $i$:\n$$\n0 = c(1-p) - ep\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $c$ and $e$:\n$$\n0 = \\left[ m p (N-1)K \\right](1-p) - \\left[ e_0 A^{-\\gamma} \\right]p\n$$\nThis equation must be solved for the steady-state occupancy $p$. We can factor out a term $p$:\n$$\n0 = p \\left[ m(N-1)K(1-p) - e_0 A^{-\\gamma} \\right]\n$$\nThis equation yields two possible solutions for $p$.\n1. $p=0$: This is the trivial steady state, corresponding to the extinction of the species from the entire metacommunity.\n2. The term in the brackets is zero: This gives the nontrivial steady-state occupancy, $p^{\\ast}$.\n$$\nm(N-1)K(1-p^{\\ast}) - e_0 A^{-\\gamma} = 0\n$$\nWe solve this equation for $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nm(N-1)K(1-p^{\\ast}) = e_0 A^{-\\gamma}\n$$\n$$\n1-p^{\\ast} = \\frac{e_0 A^{-\\gamma}}{m(N-1)K}\n$$\n$$\np^{\\ast} = 1 - \\frac{e_0 A^{-\\gamma}}{m(N-1)K}\n$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the nontrivial steady-state occupancy. A biologically meaningful solution requires $0 < p^{\\ast} \\le 1$, which imposes a condition on the parameters: $m(N-1)K > e_0 A^{-\\gamma}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $p^{\\ast}$ using the given parameter values:\n- $N = 50$\n- $m = 0.5$\n- $K = 0.1$\n- $e_0 = 0.3$\n- $\\gamma = 0.25$\n- $A = 100$\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator of the fraction:\n$$\nm(N-1)K = (0.5)(50-1)(0.1) = (0.5)(49)(0.1) = 2.45\n$$\nNext, calculate the numerator:\n$$\ne_0 A^{-\\gamma} = (0.3)(100)^{-0.25} = (0.3)(100)^{-1/4}\n$$\nSince $100 = 10^2$, we have $(10^2)^{-1/4} = 10^{-2/4} = 10^{-1/2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}}$.\nSo, the numerator is $\\frac{0.3}{\\sqrt{10}}$.\n\nNow, substitute these back into the expression for $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$\np^{\\ast} = 1 - \\frac{0.3/\\sqrt{10}}{2.45} = 1 - \\frac{0.3}{2.45\\sqrt{10}}\n$$\nNumerically evaluating this expression:\n$$\np^{\\ast} \\approx 1 - \\frac{0.3}{2.45 \\times 3.16227766} \\approx 1 - \\frac{0.3}{7.747579...}\n$$\n$$\np^{\\ast} \\approx 1 - 0.0387217... \\approx 0.961278...\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as requested, gives $0.9613$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9613}$$", "id": "2507834"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple occupancy, spatial processes like dispersal and environmental fluctuations create large-scale patterns, such as the synchronous rise and fall of populations across a region.

Since $A$ and $D$ are both polynomials in the matrix $J$, they commute, i.e., $AD=DA$. This implies that $A$ and $C$ also commute, because $C$ is a function of $A$ and $D$. Therefore, $AC=CA$, and the Lyapunov equation reduces to:\n$$\n2AC + 2D = 0 \\implies AC = -D\n$$\nTo find $C$, we must compute the inverse of $A$.

It can be calculated by subtracting the unique environmental fraction from the total variation explained by the environment.\n    $$ \\left[\\mathrm{E}\\cap\\mathrm{S}\\right] = \\left[\\mathrm{E}\\right] - \\left[\\mathrm{E}\\mid\\mathrm{S}\\right] = 0.18 - 0.06 = 0.12 $$\n    As a consistency check, it can also be calculated by subtracting the unique spatial fraction from the total variation explained by space.\n    $$ \\left[\\mathrm{E}\\cap\\mathrm{S}\\right] = \\left[\\mathrm{S}\\right] - \\left[\\mathrm{S}\\mid\\mathrm{E}\\right] = 0.27 - 0.15 = 0.12 $$\n    The calculations are consistent.\n\n4.  **Unexplained fraction $\\mathrm{U}$**: This is the proportion of total variation ($1$) not explained by the full model.\n    $$ \\mathrm{U} = 1 - R^2_{adj}(\\mathbf{Y}\\sim \\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{S}) = 1 - 0.33 = 0.67 $$\n\n**Summary of Calculated Fractions:**\n- $\\left[\\mathrm{E}\\mid\\mathrm{S}\\right] = 0.06$\n- $\\left[\\mathrm{S}\\mid\\mathrm{E}\\right] = 0.15$\n- $\\left[\\mathrm{E}\\cap\\mathrm{S}\\right] = 0.12$\n- $\\mathrm{U} = 0.67$\n\n**Role of Moran’s Eigenvector Maps (MEM/dbMEM)**\nMoran's Eigenvector Maps are a method of spatial analysis. They are constructed by the spectral (eigen) decomposition of a spatial weighting matrix $\\mathbf{W}$ that encodes the spatial relationships (e.g., connectivity, proximity) among sampling sites. The resulting eigenvectors form an orthogonal basis that can be used as predictors in a linear model to represent spatial structures at different scales.\n\n- The eigenvectors corresponding to positive eigenvalues of the centered spatial weighting matrix capture positive spatial autocorrelation (i.e., nearby sites are more similar than distant sites), representing broad-scale patterns.\n- The dbMEM variant specifically uses a truncated distance matrix to focus on positive spatial autocorrelation relevant to most ecological processes.\n- By including these eigenvectors as the spatial predictor set $\\mathbf{S}$ in a variation partitioning framework, one can statistically isolate the unique effect of the environment ($\\left[\\mathrm{E}\\mid\\mathrm{S}\\right]$) from effects induced either by pure spatial processes like dispersal limitation ($\\left[\\mathrm{S}\\mid\\mathrm{E}\\right]$) or by environmental variables that are themselves spatially patterned ($\\left[\\mathrm{E}\\cap\\mathrm{S}\\right]$).\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. $\\left[\\mathrm{E}\\mid\\mathrm{S}\\right]=0.06$, $\\left[\\mathrm{S}\\mid\\mathrm{E}\\right]=0.15$, $\\left[\\mathrm{E}\\cap\\mathrm{S}\\right]=0.12$, $\\mathrm{U}=0.67$; MEM/dbMEM provide an orthogonal basis of spatial predictors obtained by eigen-decomposing a spatial weighting or truncated distance matrix to represent positive spatial autocorrelation at multiple spatial scales; including them as $\\mathbf{S}$ allows separation of unique environmental effects from spatially structured environment or dispersal processes.**\n- **Numerical values**: The calculated fractions match our derivation precisely: $\\left[\\mathrm{E}\\mid\\mathrm{S}\\right]=0.06$, $\\left[\\mathrm{S}\\mid\\mathrm{E}\\right]=0.15$, $\\left[\\mathrm{E}\\cap\\mathrm{S}\\right]=0.12$, and $\\mathrm{U}=0.67$.\n- **Theoretical description**: The description of MEM/dbMEM is accurate. They are orthogonal predictors derived from the eigen-decomposition of a spatial matrix, they model spatial autocorrelation, and their purpose in variation partitioning is to disentangle environmental and spatial effects.\n- **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**B. $\\left[\\mathrm{E}\\mid\\mathrm{S}\\right]=0.12$, $\\left[\\mathrm{S}\\mid\\mathrm{E}\\right]=0.06$, $\\left[\\mathrm{E}\\cap\\mathrm{S}\\right]=0.15$, $\\mathrm{U}=0.67$; MEM/dbMEM render environmental variables unnecessary because they absorb all spatially structured environmental effects, so omitting $\\mathbf{E}$ does not bias inference.**\n- **Numerical values**: The values for $\\left[\\mathrm{E}\\mid\\mathrm{S}\\right]$, $\\left[\\mathrm{S}\\mid\\mathrm{E}\\right]$, and $\\left[\\mathrm{E}\\cap\\mathrm{S}\\right]$ are incorrect.\n- **Theoretical description**: The statement that MEM/dbMEM \"render environmental variables unnecessary\" is fundamentally wrong. MEM absorb the spatially structured component of environmental variation ($\\left[\\mathrm{E}\\cap\\mathrm{S}\\right]$), but they do not account for the non-spatial, unique environmental variation ($\\left[\\mathrm{E}\\mid\\mathrm{S}\\right]$), which in this case is $0.06$. Omitting $\\mathbf{E}$ would be a grave error, leading to a biased model that ignores a significant component of community variation.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**C. $\\left[\\mathrm{E}\\mid\\mathrm{S}\\right]=0.33$, $\\left[\\mathrm{S}\\mid\\mathrm{E}\\right]=0.00$, $\\left[\\mathrm{E}\\cap\\mathrm{S}\\right]=0.12$, $\\mathrm{U}=0.55$; MEM/dbMEM are obtained by eigen-decomposing the species covariance matrix $\\mathbf{Y}^{\\top}\\mathbf{Y}$, so they primarily encode biotic interaction structure rather than space.**\n- **Numerical values**: All calculated fractions are incorrect.\n- **Theoretical description**: This statement fatally confuses the method for generating spatial predictors (MEM) with Principal Components Analysis (PCA). MEM are derived from the eigen-decomposition of a spatial weighting matrix based on site coordinates. A PCA is derived from the eigen-decomposition of the species covariance or correlation matrix (e.g., $\\mathbf{Y}^{\\top}\\mathbf{Y}$). Thus, MEM encode spatial structure by definition, not biotic structure from the species data.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. $\\left[\\mathrm{E}\\mid\\mathrm{S}\\right]=0.06$, $\\left[\\mathrm{S}\\mid\\mathrm{E}\\right]=0.15$, $\\left[\\mathrm{E}\\cap\\mathrm{S}\\right]=0.12$, $\\mathrm{U}=0.55$; only broad-scale MEM (those with the largest eigenvalues) should be used because fine-scale eigenvectors are not orthogonal and would inflate the shared fraction.**\n- **Numerical values**: The value for the unexplained fraction, $\\mathrm{U}$, is incorrect ($0.55$ instead of the correct $0.67$).\n- **Theoretical description**: The statement that \"fine-scale eigenvectors are not orthogonal\" is mathematically false. The eigenvectors of the symmetric spatial matrix used to generate MEM are guaranteed to be orthogonal. The choice of which eigenvectors (broad-scale, fine-scale, or all) to include is a modeling decision, but the premise that they are not orthogonal is wrong.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2507824"}]}
