It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective question rooted in the application of probability theory to a standard null model in theoretical ecology. All definitions are precise, and the provided information is sufficient to derive a unique, analytical solution.\n\nLet $S$ denote the number of species. The problem states that the food web is a directed graph where self-links (cannibalism) are permitted. The set of all possible directed links consists of all ordered pairs of species $(i,j)$, where $i, j \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, S\\}$. The total number of such possible links is $N = S \\times S = S^2$.\n\nFor each of the $N=S^2$ possible links, we define an indicator random variable, $X_{ij}$, for the event that a directed link from species $i$ to species $j$ exists.\n$$\nX_{ij} =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if a link from } i \\text{ to } j \\text{ exists} \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nAccording to the problem, these events are independent for each pair $(i,j)$, and the probability of a link is $p$. Thus, each $X_{ij}$ is an independent Bernoulli random variable with parameter $p$.\nThe probability mass function is $P(X_{ij}=1) = p$ and $P(X_{ij}=0) = 1-p$.\n\nThe expected value and variance of a single indicator variable $X_{ij}$ are:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X_{ij}] = 1 \\cdot P(X_{ij}=1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_{ij}=0) = p $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(X_{ij}) = \\mathbb{E}[X_{ij}^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[X_{ij}])^2 = (1^2 \\cdot p + 0^2 \\cdot (1-p)) - p^2 = p - p^2 = p(1-p) $$\n\nThe total number of realized links, $L$, is the sum of all these indicator variables over all $S^2$ possible pairs:\n$$ L = \\sum_{i=1}^{S} \\sum_{j=1}^{S} X_{ij} $$\nThe connectance, $C$, is defined as the fraction of realized links out of the total possible links:\n$$ C = \\frac{L}{S^2} $$\n\nFirst, we will derive the expected connectance, $\\mathbb{E}[C]$.

Since $S^2$ is a constant, we can use the property $\\mathbb{E}[aX] = a\\mathbb{E}[X]$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[C] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{L}{S^2}\\right] = \\frac{1}{S^2} \\mathbb{E}[L] = \\frac{1}{S^2} (S^2 p) $$\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[C] = p $$\n\nNext, we will derive the variance of connectance, $\\mathrm{Var}(C)$. We start by calculating the variance of the number of links, $\\mathrm{Var}(L)$. The problem specifies that the formation of each link is an independent event. Therefore, all the indicator variables $X_{ij}$ are mutually independent. For a sum of independent random variables, the variance of the sum is the sum of their variances:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(L) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{S} \\sum_{j=1}^{S} X_{ij}\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{S} \\sum_{j=1}^{S} \\mathrm{Var}(X_{ij}) $$\nSince $\\mathrm{Var}(X_{ij}) = p(1-p)$ for every one of the $S^2$ variables, we sum this constant value $S^2$ times:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(L) = \\sum_{i=1}^{S} \\sum_{j=1}^{S} p(1-p) = S^2 p(1-p) $$\nNow, we can find the variance of the connectance $C$.

A rigorous derivation of the solution will now be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected number of links, $E[L]$, and the expected connectance, $E[C]$. We begin by formalizing the structure of the food web.\n\nLet $A_{rc}$ be a binary random variable representing the entry in the adjacency matrix at row $r$ and column $c$. $A_{rc} = 1$ if a trophic link exists from species $r$ (resource) to species $c$ (consumer), and $A_{rc} = 0$ otherwise.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the cascade model imposes a strict hierarchical ordering. A link from $r$ to $c$ can only exist if $c > r$. For these admissible pairs, the link is realized with probability $p$. For all other pairs where $c \\le r$, no link can exist. This can be summarized as:\n$$\nA_{rc} \\sim \\begin{cases}\n\\text{Bernoulli}(p) & \\text{if } c > r \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } c \\le r\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe expected value of the random variable $A_{rc}$ is therefore:\n$$\nE[A_{rc}] = \\begin{cases}\n1 \\cdot p + 0 \\cdot (1-p) = p & \\text{if } c > r \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } c \\le r\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe total number of realized links, $L$, is the sum of all entries in the adjacency matrix:\n$$\nL = \\sum_{r=1}^{S} \\sum_{c=1}^{S} A_{rc}\n$$\nDue to the model's constraint that $A_{rc} = 0$ for $c \\le r$, the summation can be restricted to only the pairs $(r,c)$ where $c > r$:\n$$\nL = \\sum_{r=1}^{S-1} \\sum_{c=r+1}^{S} A_{rc}\n$$\nTo find the expected number of links $E[L]$, we apply the linearity of expectation to the expression for $L$:\n$$\nE[L] = E\\left[\\sum_{r=1}^{S-1} \\sum_{c=r+1}^{S} A_{rc}\\right] = \\sum_{r=1}^{S-1} \\sum_{c=r+1}^{S} E[A_{rc}]\n$$\nFor every term in this sum, the condition $c > r$ is met, so $E[A_{rc}] = p$. The sum becomes:\n$$\nE[L] = \\sum_{r=1}^{S-1} \\sum_{c=r+1}^{S} p\n$$\nThis is equivalent to the probability $p$ multiplied by the number of terms in the summation. The number of terms is the count of all possible links under the cascade model's constraint, which is the number of pairs of indices $(r,c)$ such that $1 \\le r < c \\le S$. This is equivalent to choosing $2$ distinct species from a set of $S$, which can be calculated using the binomial coefficient $\\binom{S}{2}$.\nThe number of such pairs is:\n$$\n\\sum_{r=1}^{S-1} \\sum_{c=r+1}^{S} 1 = \\sum_{r=1}^{S-1} (S - r) = (S-1) + (S-2) + \\dots + 1 = \\frac{(S-1)S}{2} = \\binom{S}{2}\n$$\nTherefore, the expected number of links is:\n$$\nE[L] = p \\cdot \\frac{S(S-1)}{2}\n$$\nNext, we derive the expected connectance, $E[C]$. The problem defines connectance as $C = \\frac{L}{S(S-1)}$. This is a standard definition where the number of links is normalized by the total number of possible directed links in a network of $S$ nodes without self-loops, which is $S(S-1)$.\nWe find the expectation of $C$ by again using the linearity of expectation. Since $S$ is a given constant, the term $1/[S(S-1)]$ is a constant factor (assuming $S > 1$, which is necessary for a network).\n$$\nE[C] = E\\left[\\frac{L}{S(S-1)}\\right] = \\frac{1}{S(S-1)} E[L]\n$$\nSubstituting the expression we derived for $E[L]$:\n$$\nE[C] = \\frac{1}{S(S-1)} \\left(p \\frac{S(S-1)}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThe term $S(S-1)$ cancels from the numerator and the denominator, yielding a simple result for the expected connectance:\n$$\nE[C] = \\frac{p}{2}\n$$\nThe final answer is the ordered pair $(E[L], E[C])$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{pS(S-1)}{2} & \\frac{p}{2} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2492743"}, {"introduction": "Aggregate metrics like connectance can be deceptive, as webs with the same link density can have vastly different architectures and ecological functions.

Under random deletion of a single prey (chosen uniformly among the $S=6$ species), in Web A every consumer has $g_j=2$, so removing any single prey reduces some predators from $2$ to $1$ prey but does not reduce any to $0$; the expected number of immediate predator extinctions is therefore $0$.\n\nIn Web B, predators $3,4,5$ each have $g_j=1$, and all depend uniquely on prey $1$ (from the matrix). Removing prey $1$ causes $3$ immediate predator extinctions; removing any other prey causes none. With a uniform choice among $6$ prey species, the expected number of immediate predator extinctions is\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\text{extinctions}] \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{6}\\cdot 3 \\;+\\; \\frac{5}{6}\\cdot 0 \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nTherefore the expected immediate secondary extinctions are $0$ (Web A) versus $1/2$ (Web B), not identical. Statement A is Incorrect.\n\nB. “The probability that removal of a single prey induces multiple immediate predator extinctions is higher in Web B than in Web A.”\n\nIn Web A, removal of any single prey does not cause any predator to lose all prey, so the probability is $0$. In Web B, removal of prey $1$ causes $3$ predator extinctions, which happens with probability $1/6>0$. Therefore the probability of multiple immediate predator extinctions is higher in Web B. Statement B is Correct.\n\nC. “Because $C$ is identical, the leading eigenvalue of a random community matrix with identically distributed interaction strengths is necessarily identical in Web A and Web B; hence their local stability margins are the same.”\n\nRobert May’s classical result for large, random communities connects local stability to $S$, $C$, and the variance of interaction strengths, predicting a stability boundary when a characteristic eigenvalue radius scales like $\\sigma \\sqrt{SC}$. However, that result assumes homogeneous random wiring. When wiring is heterogeneous, degree heterogeneity influences the spectral properties: a more precise bound on the spectral radius of the off-diagonal part of the community matrix involves the maximum row or column sums (by Gershgorin’s circle theorem) and, more generally, scales with higher moments of the degree distribution (for instance, in random graph theory, the largest eigenvalue increases with $\\langle k^2\\rangle/\\langle k\\rangle$ at fixed $\\langle k\\rangle$). In Web B, the generality distribution is highly skewed with a maximum generality of $5$, whereas in Web A the maximum generality is $2$. With interaction strengths of comparable magnitude across links, the increased heterogeneity in Web B increases upper bounds on the leading eigenvalue and typically increases the leading eigenvalue relative to Web A, even though $C$ is the same. Therefore identical $C$ does not imply identical leading eigenvalues or stability margins across these two webs. Statement C is Incorrect.\n\nD. “Targeted removal of the most generalist predator causes a larger reduction in mean predation pressure per prey in Web A than in Web B.”\n\nMean predation pressure per prey is $\\bar{v} = L/S = \\bar{g}$. Removing a predator with generality $g_{\\max}$ reduces $L$ by $g_{\\max}$ and thus reduces $\\bar{v}$ by $g_{\\max}/S$.\n\n- In Web A, $g_{\\max}=2$, so the reduction is $2/6 = 1/3$.\n- In Web B, $g_{\\max}=5$ (predator $1$), so the reduction is $5/6$.\n\nThus the reduction is larger in Web B, not in Web A. Statement D is Incorrect.\n\nE. “At fixed $C$, any difference in the variance of generality across consumers necessarily implies an identical difference in the variance of vulnerability across prey.”\n\nGenerality and vulnerability are column and row sums, respectively, of the same adjacency matrix, and their distributions can vary independently subject to the total link constraint $\\sum_j g_j = \\sum_i v_i = L$. At fixed $S$ and $L$ (hence fixed $C$ and $\\bar{g}=\\bar{v}$), one can construct examples where variance in generality differs while vulnerability variance is the same, or vice versa; there is no necessity that a difference in $\\mathrm{Var}(g)$ be mirrored identically in $\\mathrm{Var}(v)$. In the specific case given, Web A has $\\mathrm{Var}(v)=0$ and Web B has heterogeneous $v$ with nonzero variance, but this is a contingent outcome, not a necessity. Therefore the claim of necessity is false. Statement E is Incorrect.\n\nConclusion: Only statement B is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2492759"}]}
