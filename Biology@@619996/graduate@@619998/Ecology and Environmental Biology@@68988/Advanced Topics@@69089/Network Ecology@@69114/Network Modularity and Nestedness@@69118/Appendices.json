A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\nLet the given adjacency matrix be $A$, where the rows are indexed by $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and columns by $j \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1  1  1\\\\\n1  1  0\\\\\n1  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe rows of the matrix are $R_1 = (1, 1, 1)$, $R_2 = (1, 1, 0)$, and $R_3 = (1, 0, 0)$.\nThe columns of the matrix are $C_1 = (1, 1, 1)^T$, $C_2 = (1, 1, 0)^T$, and $C_3 = (1, 0, 0)^T$.\n\nFirst, we compute the row degrees ($k_{R_i}$) and column degrees ($k_{C_j}$). The degree of a node is the sum of its connections, which corresponds to the sum of the entries in its corresponding row or column.\n\nRow degrees:\n$$k_{R_1} = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} a_{1j} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3$$\n$$k_{R_2} = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} a_{2j} = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2$$\n$$k_{R_3} = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} a_{3j} = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1$$\n\nColumn degrees:\n$$k_{C_1} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} a_{i1} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3$$\n$$k_{C_2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} a_{i2} = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2$$\n$$k_{C_3} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} a_{i3} = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1$$\n\nNext, we identify all comparable pairs of rows and columns.

The problem is scientifically grounded in standard network theory, is self-contained, and mathematically well-posed. All required data and definitions are either provided or are standard in the field. Therefore, the problem is valid, and I will proceed with its solution.\n\nFirst, we compute the degree $k_i$ for each species $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The degree of a node in an unweighted network is the sum of the entries in the corresponding row (or column) of the adjacency matrix $A$.\nThe given adjacency matrix is:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  1  1  0 \\\\\n1  0  1  0 \\\\\n1  1  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe degrees are calculated as $k_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{4} A_{ij}$:\nThe degree of species $1$ is $k_1 = A_{11} + A_{12} + A_{13} + A_{14} = 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 2$.\nThe degree of species $2$ is $k_2 = A_{21} + A_{22} + A_{23} + A_{24} = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 2$.\nThe degree of species $3$ is $k_3 = A_{31} + A_{32} + A_{33} + A_{34} = 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2$.\nThe degree of species $4$ is $k_4 = A_{41} + A_{42} + A_{43} + A_{44} = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0$.\nSpecies $4$ is an isolated node.\n\nThe total number of edges $m$ in an undirected network is given by the handshaking lemma, $2m = \\sum_{i} k_i$.\nSumming the degrees, we find:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{4} k_i = k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + k_4 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 6\n$$\nTherefore, $2m = 6$, which gives the total number of edges as $m=3$.\n\nNext, we compute the Newman–Girvan modularity $Q$ for the given partition $g=(1,1,2,2)$. This partition defines two modules: module $1$ containing species $\\{1, 2\\}$ and module $2$ containing species $\\{3, 4\\}$.\nThe formula for modularity is:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{i,j} \\left[ A_{ij} - \\frac{k_i k_j}{2m} \\right] \\delta(g_i, g_j)\n$$\nwhere $g_i$ is the module assignment of node $i$, and $\\delta(g_i, g_j)$ is the Kronecker delta, which is $1$ if $g_i = g_j$ and $0$ otherwise. The term $A_{ij}$ is the actual number of edges between nodes $i$ and $j$, while $\\frac{k_i k_j}{2m}$ is the expected number of edges between them in a randomized network with the same degree sequence (the configuration model).\n\nThe sum can be more conveniently expressed by summing over the modules. For a partition into modules $c$, the modularity is:\n$$\nQ = \\sum_{c} \\left( \\frac{L_c}{m} - \\left(\\frac{d_c}{2m}\\right)^2 \\right)\n$$\nwhere $L_c$ is the number of edges entirely within module $c$, and $d_c$ is the sum of the degrees of the nodes in module $c$.\n\nLet's analyze module $1$, which consists of species $\\{1, 2\\}$.\nThe number of internal edges, $L_1$, is the number of edges connecting nodes within this module. From the adjacency matrix, the only such connection is between species $1$ and $2$, for which $A_{12} = 1$. Thus, $L_1 = 1$.\nThe sum of degrees for nodes in module $1$ is $d_1 = k_1 + k_2 = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n\nNow let's analyze module $2$, which consists of species $\\{3, 4\\}$.\nThe number of internal edges, $L_2$, corresponds to the link between species $3$ and $4$. From the adjacency matrix, $A_{34} = 0$. Thus, $L_2 = 0$.\nThe sum of degrees for nodes in module $2$ is $d_2 = k_3 + k_4 = 2 + 0 = 2$.\n\nWe have all necessary components: $m=3$, $2m=6$.\nFor module $1$: $L_1=1$, $d_1=4$.\nFor module $2$: $L_2=0$, $d_2=2$.\n\nNow we substitute these values into the modularity formula:\n$$\nQ = \\left( \\frac{L_1}{m} - \\left(\\frac{d_1}{2m}\\right)^2 \\right) + \\left( \\frac{L_2}{m} - \\left(\\frac{d_2}{2m}\\right)^2 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nQ = \\left( \\frac{1}{3} - \\left(\\frac{4}{6}\\right)^2 \\right) + \\left( \\frac{0}{3} - \\left(\\frac{2}{6}\\right)^2 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nQ = \\left( \\frac{1}{3} - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 \\right) + \\left( 0 - \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nQ = \\left( \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{4}{9} \\right) - \\frac{1}{9}\n$$\n$$\nQ = \\left( \\frac{3}{9} - \\frac{4}{9} \\right) - \\frac{1}{9}\n$$\n$$\nQ = -\\frac{1}{9} - \\frac{1}{9} = -\\frac{2}{9}\n$$\nThe exact value of the modularity for the given partition is $Q = -2/9$.\n\nFinally, we must assess the meaning of this result. Modularity $Q$ measures the density of links inside communities as compared to links between communities. A positive value of $Q$ indicates the presence of community structure, meaning there are more edges within the proposed modules than would be expected by chance. A value of $Q$ near $0$ implies the partitioning is no better than random. A negative value of $Q$, as we have found here, indicates that there are fewer edges within the modules than expected at random. This signifies a disassortative structure, where nodes preferentially connect to nodes in other modules. In this case, $Q = -2/9$ is distinctly negative. This implies that the partition $g=(1,1,2,2)$ is a poor description of the network's community structure. The network is structured such that there are more connections *between* the proposed modules than would be expected, not within them. Therefore, the modular structure indicated by $g$ is not meaningful; in fact, it is contrary to the actual connectivity pattern.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{9}}\n$$", "id": "2511944"}, {"introduction": "After understanding how to measure modularity, the next logical question is how to find the optimal modular partition of a network.
