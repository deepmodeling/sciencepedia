For each species (row), the entries of a count matrix represent the observed frequencies of prey items found in its stomach contents, partitioned by prey species (columns). Assume stomach observations for each species are independent and identically distributed categorical draws over prey species. Under this assumption, the diet of each species is modeled as a categorical distribution with an unknown probability vector equal to the corresponding row of the diet matrix $D$, where each row is nonnegative and sums to $1$ whenever the total count for that species is positive. Rows for which the total count is zero are treated as having no identified prey and therefore are left as the all-zero row in $D$.\n\nTask A: Using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), estimate the diet matrix $D$ from the provided count matrices by maximizing the multinomial likelihood for each row separately, subject to nonnegativity and row-stochastic constraints.\n\nTask B: Using the definition that a consumerâ€™s trophic position is one plus the diet-weighted average of its prey trophic positions, and that basal species (those with no prey) have trophic position equal to one, derive a linear system for the trophic positions vector $\\tau$ and solve for $\\tau$ for each case using your estimated $D$.\n\nInstructions and output requirements:\n- For each case, construct the MLE diet matrix $D$ by normalizing each row with positive total count so that its entries sum to $1$; if a row sum is $0$, leave that row as all zeros.\n- From $D$, compute $\\tau$ as the unique solution to the linear system implied by the definition above.\n- Return the vector $\\tau$ of trophic positions for each case as decimal floats rounded to exactly $6$ decimal places.\n- Your program must not read any input; it must compute the results for the cases below and print a single line containing a list of lists, where each inner list corresponds to one case's trophic positions.\n- The single output line must be a valid Python-like list literal, for example $[ [\\dots], [\\dots], [\\dots] ]$ with floats rounded to $6$ decimal places.\n\nTest suite (three independent cases):\n- Case $1$ ($3$ species).

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. I will therefore proceed with a complete derivation and solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts: first, the estimation of a diet matrix $D$ from a count matrix $C$, and second, the calculation of trophic positions $\\tau$ based on the estimated diet matrix.\n\n### Part A: Maximum Likelihood Estimation of the Diet Matrix\n\nThe problem states that for each predator species $i$, the counts of its prey, given in row $i$ of the count matrix $C$, are draws from a categorical distribution. The parameters of this distribution are the unknown diet proportions, which form row $i$ of the diet matrix $D$. Let the number of species be $n$. For a predator species $i$, its corresponding row in the count matrix is $C_i = (C_{i1}, C_{i2}, \\dots, C_{in})$, where $C_{ij}$ is the number of times prey $j$ was found in the stomach of predator $i$. The total number of observed prey items for predator $i$ is $S_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} C_{ij}$.\n\nThe corresponding row of the diet matrix is $D_i = (D_{i1}, D_{i2}, \\dots, D_{in})$, where $D_{ij}$ is the proportion of prey $j$ in the diet of predator $i$. These proportions must satisfy $D_{ij} \\ge 0$ for all $j$ and $\\sum_{j=1}^{n} D_{ij} = 1$ (unless $S_i=0$, in which case the row is all zeros).\n\nThe likelihood of observing the counts $C_i$ for a predator $i$ with $S_i > 0$ is given by the multinomial probability mass function:\n$$ L(D_i | C_i) = \\frac{S_i!}{\\prod_{j=1}^{n} C_{ij}!} \\prod_{j=1}^{n} D_{ij}^{C_{ij}} $$\nTo find the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) for the diet vector $D_i$, we maximize this function with respect to $D_{i1}, \\dots, D_{in}$, subject to the constraint $\\sum_{j=1}^{n} D_{ij} = 1$. It is more convenient to maximize the log-likelihood:\n$$ \\ln L(D_i | C_i) = \\ln(S_i!) - \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\ln(C_{ij}!) + \\sum_{j=1}^{n} C_{ij} \\ln D_{ij} $$\nUsing the method of Lagrange multipliers to incorporate the constraint, we find that the MLE for each proportion $D_{ij}$ is given by the observed frequency:\n$$ \\hat{D}_{ij, \\text{MLE}} = \\frac{C_{ij}}{S_i} = \\frac{C_{ij}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{n} C_{ik}} $$\nThis procedure is performed for each row $i$ of the count matrix $C$ for which the row sum $S_i$ is positive. If $S_i = 0$, the species has no observed prey; it is a basal species, and its corresponding row in $D$ is a zero vector as per the problem statement.\n\n### Part B: Calculation of Trophic Positions\n\nThe trophic position $\\tau_i$ of a species $i$ is defined as $1$ plus the diet-weighted average of the trophic positions of its prey. Basal species, which consume no prey, are defined to have a trophic position of $1$. This definition translates into a system of linear equations. For each species $i=1, \\dots, n$:\n$$ \\tau_i = 1 + \\sum_{j=1}^{n} D_{ij} \\tau_j $$\nHere, $D_{ij}$ is the proportion of prey $j$ in the diet of consumer $i$. The sum $\\sum_{j=1}^{n} D_{ij} \\tau_j$ represents the average trophic position of the prey consumed by species $i$.\n\nWe can express this system of $n$ equations for the $n$ unknown trophic positions $\\tau_1, \\dots, \\tau_n$ in matrix form. Let $\\tau$ be the column vector of trophic positions and $\\mathbf{1}$ be a column vector of ones of length $n$. The system is:\n$$ \\tau = \\mathbf{1} + D \\tau $$\nwhere $D$ is the $n \\times n$ diet matrix. To solve for $\\tau$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$ \\tau - D \\tau = \\mathbf{1} $$\n$$ (I - D) \\tau = \\mathbf{1} $$\nwhere $I$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix.\n\nThis is a standard linear system of the form $Ax=b$, where $A = (I - D)$, $x = \\tau$, and $b = \\mathbf{1}$. A unique solution for $\\tau$ exists if and only if the matrix $(I - D)$ is invertible (non-singular). For food web diet matrices, the spectral radius $\\rho(D)$ is typically less than $1$, which is a sufficient condition for the invertibility of $(I - D)$. The solution can then be found by:\n$$ \\tau = (I - D)^{-1} \\mathbf{1} $$\nIn practice, it is numerically more stable to solve the linear system $(I - D) \\tau = \\mathbf{1}$ directly rather than by computing the inverse of $(I - D)$.\n\nThe procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Given the count matrix $C$, compute the diet matrix $D$ by normalizing each row with a positive sum.\n2.  Construct the matrix $A = I - D$ and the vector $b = \\mathbf{1}$.\n3.

A solution will be derived from first principles as requested.\n\nThe analysis begins by defining the core quantities based on the provided flow matrix $F$.\n\nThe total system throughput, $T$, is the sum of all individual flows in the network:\n$$ T = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\sum_{j=1}^{3} F_{ij} = (0+3+2) + (1+0+4) + (4+2+0) = 5 + 5 + 6 = 16 \\, \\text{mg C m}^{-2} \\text{ d}^{-1} $$\nThe total flow through each compartment $k$, denoted $T_k$, is the sum of inflows, which equals the sum of outflows due to the steady-state condition.\n$$ T_1 = \\sum_{j} F_{1j} = 5 $$\n$$ T_2 = \\sum_{j} F_{2j} = 5 $$\n$$ T_3 = \\sum_{j} F_{3j} = 6 $$\nNote that $T_k = \\sum_j F_{kj}$ (inflow) = $\\sum_i F_{ik}$ (outflow).\n\nFollowing the problem's directive, we treat the normalized flows, $p(i, j) = F_{ij}/T$, as a joint probability distribution over the ordered pair of compartments $(j, i)$, where $j$ is the origin and $i$ is the destination.\n\nThe development capacity, $C$, represents the upper limit on organized flow and is defined as the product of the total system throughput and the Shannon entropy of the joint distribution of flows, $H(J,I)$.\n$$ C = T \\cdot H(J,I) = T \\left( -\\sum_{i,j} p(i,j) \\ln p(i,j) \\right) = -\\sum_{i,j} F_{ij} \\ln\\left(\\frac{F_{ij}}{T}\\right) $$\nThe sum is taken over all non-zero flows $F_{ij}$. The terms $p \\ln p$ are taken to be $0$ when $p=0$. Using $T=16$:\n$$ C = -F_{12}\\ln\\left(\\frac{F_{12}}{T}\\right) - F_{13}\\ln\\left(\\frac{F_{13}}{T}\\right) - F_{21}\\ln\\left(\\frac{F_{21}}{T}\\right) - F_{23}\\ln\\left(\\frac{F_{23}}{T}\\right) - F_{31}\\ln\\left(\\frac{F_{31}}{T}\\right) - F_{32}\\ln\\left(\\frac{F_{32}}{T}\\right) $$\n$$ C = -3\\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{16}\\right) - 2\\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{16}\\right) - 1\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{16}\\right) - 4\\ln\\left(\\frac{4}{16}\\right) - 4\\ln\\left(\\frac{4}{16}\\right) - 2\\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{16}\\right) $$\nUsing the property $\\ln(a/b) = \\ln a - \\ln b$ and combining terms:\n$$ C = -\\sum F_{ij}\\ln(F_{ij}) + (\\sum F_{ij})\\ln(T) = -[3\\ln 3 + 2\\ln 2 + 1\\ln 1 + 4\\ln 4 + 4\\ln 4 + 2\\ln 2] + 16\\ln 16 $$\n$$ C = -[3\\ln 3 + 4\\ln 2 + 0 + 8\\ln 4] + 16\\ln 16 = -[3\\ln 3 + 4\\ln 2 + 8(2\\ln 2)] + 16(4\\ln 2) $$\n$$ C = -[3\\ln 3 + 20\\ln 2] + 64\\ln 2 = 44\\ln 2 - 3\\ln 3 $$\nNumerically, this is:\n$$ C \\approx 44(0.693147) - 3(1.098612) \\approx 30.49847 - 3.295836 = 27.20263 \\, \\text{mg C m}^{-2} \\text{ d}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{nat} $$\n\nThe ascendency, $A$, quantifies the organized portion of the flow structure. It is defined as the product of the total system throughput and the average mutual information between the origin ($J$) and destination ($I$) of flows, $AMI(J;I)$.\n$$ A = T \\cdot AMI(J;I) = T \\sum_{i,j} p(i,j) \\ln\\left(\\frac{p(i,j)}{p(j)p(i)}\\right) $$\nHere, $p(j) = T_j/T$ is the marginal probability of a flow originating from $j$, and $p(i) = T_i/T$ is the marginal probability of a flow terminating in $i$.\n$$ A = \\sum_{i,j} F_{ij} \\ln\\left(\\frac{F_{ij}/T}{(T_j/T)(T_i/T)}\\right) = \\sum_{i,j} F_{ij} \\ln\\left(\\frac{F_{ij} T}{T_i T_j}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the values $T=16$, $T_1=5$, $T_2=5$, $T_3=6$:\n$$ A = 3\\ln\\left(\\frac{3 \\cdot 16}{5 \\cdot 5}\\right) + 2\\ln\\left(\\frac{2 \\cdot 16}{5 \\cdot 6}\\right) + 1\\ln\\left(\\frac{1 \\cdot 16}{5 \\cdot 5}\\right) + 4\\ln\\left(\\frac{4 \\cdot 16}{5 \\cdot 6}\\right) + 4\\ln\\left(\\frac{4 \\cdot 16}{6 \\cdot 5}\\right) + 2\\ln\\left(\\frac{2 \\cdot 16}{6 \\cdot 5}\\right) $$\nThe arguments for the logarithms correspond to flows $F_{12}, F_{13}, F_{21}, F_{23}, F_{31}, F_{32}$. Note that for $F_{ij}$, $T_i$ is the throughflow of the recipient and $T_j$ is the throughflow of the donor. So for $F_{12}$ (from 2 to 1), $T_i=T_1=5, T_j=T_2=5$.
