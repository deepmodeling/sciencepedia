A solution will be derived.\n\nThe net radiation, $R_n$, at the upper surface of the leaf is the sum of the net shortwave radiation, $S_{net}$, and the net longwave radiation, $L_{net}$. The energy balance equation is therefore:\n$$R_n = S_{net} + L_{net}$$\nEach component will be derived separately based on the provided information.\n\n1.  Net Shortwave Radiation ($S_{net}$)\nThis term is the difference between incoming shortwave irradiance, $S$, and reflected shortwave irradiance.

Net Longwave Radiation ($L_{net}$)\nThis term is the difference between the longwave radiation absorbed by the leaf surface and the longwave radiation emitted by it.\n$$L_{net} = L_{abs} - L_{emit}$$\n- The incoming longwave radiation is from the sky. The sky is modeled as a blackbody at an effective temperature $T_{\\mathrm{sky}}$ (assumption ii). With a view factor of unity (assumption v), the incident longwave irradiance is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law as $\\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sky}}^4$. By Kirchhoff's law (assumption iii), the leaf's longwave absorptivity is equal to its emissivity, $\\epsilon$. Therefore, the absorbed longwave radiation is:\n$$L_{abs} = \\epsilon \\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sky}}^4$$\n- The leaf itself emits longwave radiation as a gray body. The emitted longwave radiation is given by:\n$$L_{emit} = \\epsilon \\sigma T_s^4$$\nwhere $T_s$ is the surface temperature of the leaf.\n- Combining these, the net longwave radiation is:\n$$L_{net} = \\epsilon \\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sky}}^4 - \\epsilon \\sigma T_s^4 = \\epsilon \\sigma (T_{\\mathrm{sky}}^4 - T_s^4)$$\nThis is the second component of the net radiation budget.\n\n3.

Substituting this into the PDE gives an ordinary differential equation for the spatial part $Z(z)$:\n$$\ni\\omega Z(z)e^{i\\omega t} = \\kappa \\frac{d^2 Z}{dz^2} e^{i\\omega t}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 Z}{dz^2} - \\left(\\frac{i\\omega}{\\kappa}\\right) Z = 0\n$$\nThis is a second-order linear ODE with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is $r^2 - \\frac{i\\omega}{\\kappa} = 0$. The roots are $r = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{i\\omega}{\\kappa}}$. We evaluate the complex square root:\n$$\n\\sqrt{i} = \\sqrt{e^{i\\pi/2}} = e^{i\\pi/4} = \\cos(\\pi/4) + i\\sin(\\pi/4) = \\frac{1+i}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nThus, the roots are:\n$$\nr = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{\\kappa}} \\frac{1+i}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\kappa}}(1+i)\n$$\nLet us define the real-valued characteristic wave number $k = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\kappa}}$. The units of $k$ are $\\text{m}^{-1}$. The roots are then $\\pm k(1+i)$.\n\nThe general solution for $Z(z)$ is:\n$$\nZ(z) = C_1 e^{k(1+i)z} + C_2 e^{-k(1+i)z}\n$$\nThe full complex temperature is $\\tilde{T}(z,t) = \\left( C_1 e^{kz}e^{ikz} + C_2 e^{-kz}e^{-ikz} \\right) e^{i\\omega t}$.\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions.\nFor the solution to remain bounded as $z \\rightarrow \\infty$, the term $e^{kz}$ which grows exponentially with depth must be eliminated. This requires that its coefficient $C_1$ must be zero.\nSo, the solution simplifies to:\n$$\nZ(z) = C_2 e^{-k(1+i)z}\n$$\nNext, we apply the surface condition at $z=0$:\n$$\n\\tilde{T}(0,t) = Z(0)e^{i\\omega t} = C_2 e^{0} e^{i\\omega t} = C_2 e^{i\\omega t}\n$$\nComparing this with the given boundary condition $\\tilde{T}(0,t) = A_0 e^{i\\omega t}$, we find that $C_2 = A_0$.\n\nThe specific solution for the complex temperature field is therefore:\n$$\n\\tilde{T}(z,t) = A_0 e^{-k(1+i)z} e^{i\\omega t} = A_0 e^{-kz} e^{-ikz} e^{i\\omega t} = A_0 e^{-kz} e^{i(\\omega t - kz)}\n$$\nThe physical temperature oscillation is the real part of $\\tilde{T}(z,t)$:\n$$\nT_{osc}(z,t) = \\text{Re}[\\tilde{T}(z,t)] = A_0 e^{-kz} \\cos(\\omega t - kz)\n$$\nThis solution represents a damped temperature wave propagating into the soil. The amplitude of the oscillation at depth $z$ is $A(z) = A_0 e^{-kz}$, and the phase is shifted by $\\phi(z) = kz$ radians relative to the surface.\n\nFrom this solution, we derive the two required quantities:\n$1$. **Temperature Buffering Fraction, $F(z)$**: This is defined as the ratio of the amplitude at depth $z$, $A(z)$, to the surface amplitude, $A_0$.\n$$\nF(z) = \\frac{A(z)}{A_0} = \\frac{A_0 e^{-kz}}{A_0} = e^{-kz}\n$$\n$F(z)$ is a dimensionless quantity that decays exponentially with depth.\n\n$2$. **Phase Lag, $\\tau(z)$**: The phase lag in radians is $\\phi(z) = kz$. A full period of oscillation, $P = 24$ hours, corresponds to a phase change of $2\\pi$ radians. The time lag $\\tau(z)$ is the fraction of the period corresponding to the phase lag $\\phi(z)$:\n$$\n\\tau(z) = \\frac{\\phi(z)}{2\\pi} \\times P = \\frac{kz}{2\\pi} \\times 24 \\text{ hours}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that this lag must be expressed in hours and reduced modulo one period to lie in the interval $[0, 24)$.\n$$\n\\tau(z) \\text{ [hours]} = \\left( \\frac{12kz}{\\pi} \\right) \\pmod{24}\n$$\n\nFor implementation, we use the given constants:\n- Soil thermal diffusivity: $\\kappa = 0.8 \\times 10^{-6}$ m$^2$ s$^{-1}$.\n- Period: $P = 24$ hours. In SI units, $P_s = 24 \\times 3600 = 86400$ s.\n- Angular frequency: $\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{P_s}$.\n- Characteristic wave number: $k = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\kappa}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi / P_s}{2\\kappa}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{P_s \\kappa}}$.\n\nThe final expressions for computation are:\n$$\nF(z) = \\exp\\left(-z\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{P_s \\kappa}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\tau(z) = \\left(\\frac{12z}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{P_s \\kappa}}\\right) \\pmod{24}\n$$\nThese expressions will be implemented for the specified test depths $z = 0.50$ m, $z = 0.00$ m, and $z = 1.00$ m.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the temperature buffering fraction and phase lag at different soil depths.\n\n    The solution is derived from the 1D heat diffusion equation with a sinusoidal\n    surface temperature boundary condition.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define physical constants and parameters.\n    # Thermal diffusivity of soil in m^2/s\n    kappa = 0.8e-6\n    # Period of diurnal oscillation in hours\n    P_hours = 24.0\n    # Period in seconds\n    P_sec = P_hours * 3600.0\n\n    # Angular frequency in rad/s\n    omega = 2.0 * np.pi / P_sec\n\n    # Characteristic wave number k in 1/m\n    k = np.sqrt(omega / (2.0 * kappa))\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1 (burrow): depth z = 0.50 m.\n        0.50,\n        # Case 2 (surface boundary check): depth z = 0.00 m.\n        0.00,\n        # Case 3 (deeper soil): depth z = 1.00 m.\n        1.00,\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for z in test_cases:\n        # Calculate the temperature buffering fraction F(z).\n        # F(z) = exp(-k*z)\n        F_z = np.exp(-k * z)\n\n        # Calculate the phase lag tau(z) in hours.\n        # Phase lag in radians is phi = k*z\n        # Time lag is tau = (phi / (2*pi)) * P_hours\n        phi_rad = k * z\n        tau_z_raw = (phi_rad / (2.0 * np.pi)) * P_hours\n        \n        # Reduce the phase lag modulo one period to be in [0, 24).\n        tau_z = tau_z_raw % P_hours\n        \n        # Format results to six decimal places.\n        F_z_rounded = round(F_z, 6)\n        tau_z_rounded = round(tau_z, 6)\n        \n        results.append([F_z_rounded, tau_z_rounded])\n\n    # Format the final output string as a list of lists.\n    results_str_list = [f\"[{f_val:.6f},{t_val:.6f}]\" for f_val, t_val in results]\n    final_output = f\"[{','.join(results_str_list)}]\"\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(final_output)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2504064"}]}
