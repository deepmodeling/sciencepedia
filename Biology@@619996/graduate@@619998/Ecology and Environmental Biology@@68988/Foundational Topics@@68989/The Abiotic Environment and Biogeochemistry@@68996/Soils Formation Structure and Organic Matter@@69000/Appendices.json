This exercise hones skills in creating and analyzing minimalist models that capture the essence of complex Earth surface processes.", "problem": "Consider a soil-mantled hillslope point where soil thickness evolves due to conversion of bedrock to soil and removal of soil by erosion. Assume a one-dimensional vertical control volume per unit area, equal bulk densities of regolith and bedrock so that volumetric conversion translates directly to thickness change, spatial uniformity at the point scale, and no lateral convergence. Let soil thickness be $h(t)$, where $t$ is time. It is widely observed that bedrock-to-soil production declines exponentially with soil thickness, so take the production rate to be $P(h)=P_{0}\\exp(-\\alpha h)$, with $P_{0}>0$ and $\\alpha>0$. Assume erosion removes soil at a constant rate $E=\\beta$, with $\\beta\\ge 0$. Using conservation of mass for the soil layer as the fundamental starting point, do the following:\n\n1. Construct the minimal ordinary differential equation for $h(t)$ that balances production and erosion under the stated assumptions.\n2.

For a one-dimensional vertical control volume of unit area, the rate of change of soil thickness is the difference between the rate of soil production from bedrock and the rate of soil removal by erosion.\n\n1.  **Construction of the Governing Differential Equation**\n\nLet $\\frac{dh}{dt}$ represent the rate of change of soil thickness with respect to time $t$. The production rate $P(h)$ acts as a source term, and the erosion rate $E$ acts as a sink term. The mass balance equation is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{dh}{dt} = \\text{Production Rate} - \\text{Erosion Rate}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the production rate as a function of soil thickness $h$:\n$$\nP(h) = P_{0}\\exp(-\\alpha h)\n$$\nwhere $P_{0}$ is the maximum production rate (at $h=0$) and $\\alpha$ is a parameter that controls the rate of decline of production with thickness. Both are given as positive constants: $P_{0} > 0$ and $\\alpha > 0$.\nThe erosion rate is given as a constant:\n$$\nE = \\beta\n$$\nwhere $\\beta \\ge 0$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the mass balance equation yields the minimal ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $h(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dh}{dt} = P_{0}\\exp(-\\alpha h) - \\beta\n$$\n\n2.  **Steady-State Solution and Existence Condition**\n\nA steady state, denoted by $h^{\\ast}$, is a condition where the soil thickness no longer changes with time. This is mathematically defined by setting the time derivative to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dh}{dt} = 0\n$$\nApplying this condition to our ODE gives:\n$$\nP_{0}\\exp(-\\alpha h^{\\ast}) - \\beta = 0\n$$\nWe now solve for the steady-state thickness $h^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nP_{0}\\exp(-\\alpha h^{\\ast}) = \\beta\n$$\n$$\n\\exp(-\\alpha h^{\\ast}) = \\frac{\\beta}{P_{0}}\n$$\nTo solve for $h^{\\ast}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-\\alpha h^{\\ast} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{P_{0}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nh^{\\ast} = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{P_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $-\\ln(x) = \\ln(1/x)$, we can write the expression in a more intuitive form:\n$$\nh^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{0}}{\\beta}\\right)\n$$\nA physically meaningful steady state requires that the soil thickness $h^{\\ast}$ be real and non-negative, i.e., $h^{\\ast} \\ge 0$.\nFor the logarithm to be real, its argument must be positive. Given $P_{0}>0$, this requires $\\beta > 0$. If $\\beta = 0$, there is no erosion, and the ODE becomes $\\frac{dh}{dt} = P_{0}\\exp(-\\alpha h) > 0$, implying that soil thickness increases indefinitely and no steady state is reached. Therefore, we must have $\\beta > 0$.\nFor $h^{\\ast} \\ge 0$, and given $\\alpha > 0$, we must have:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{0}}{\\beta}\\right) \\ge 0\n$$\nThis condition is satisfied if the argument of the logarithm is greater than or equal to $1$:\n$$\n\\frac{P_{0}}{\\beta} \\ge 1 \\implies P_{0} \\ge \\beta\n$$\nThus, a physically meaningful (non-negative) steady-state soil thickness exists only if the maximum production rate is greater than or equal to the erosion rate, and the erosion rate is positive. The complete condition is $P_{0} \\ge \\beta > 0$. If $\\beta > P_{0}$, the erosion rate always exceeds the production rate, and the soil will be completely stripped away, leading to a trivial steady state of $h^{\\ast} = 0$ which is not captured by this formula (the formula yields a negative, non-physical value). The problem directs us to restrict our analysis to the parameter regime where the non-trivial steady state exists.\n\n3.  **Stability Analysis and Characteristic Timescale**\n\nTo analyze the stability of the steady-state solution $h^{\\ast}$, we perform a linear stability analysis. Let the right-hand side of the ODE be $f(h)$:\n$$\nf(h) = P_{0}\\exp(-\\alpha h) - \\beta\n$$\nWe examine the behavior of small perturbations $\\delta h(t) = h(t) - h^{\\ast}$ around the steady state. The time evolution of the perturbation is governed by the linearized equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d(\\delta h)}{dt} \\approx \\left.\\frac{df}{dh}\\right|_{h=h^{\\ast}} \\cdot \\delta h(t)\n$$\nFirst, we compute the derivative of $f(h)$ with respect to $h$:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dh} = \\frac{d}{dh}\\left(P_{0}\\exp(-\\alpha h) - \\beta\\right) = -\\alpha P_{0}\\exp(-\\alpha h)\n$$\nNext, we evaluate this derivative at the steady state $h = h^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{df}{dh}\\right|_{h=h^{\\ast}} = -\\alpha P_{0}\\exp(-\\alpha h^{\\ast})\n$$\nFrom the steady-state condition derived earlier, we know that $P_{0}\\exp(-\\alpha h^{\\ast}) = \\beta$. Substituting this into the derivative expression gives:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{df}{dh}\\right|_{h=h^{\\ast}} = -\\alpha \\beta\n$$\nThe linearized ODE for the perturbation $\\delta h$ is then:\n$$\n\\frac{d(\\delta h)}{dt} = -(\\alpha \\beta) \\delta h\n$$\nThe solution to this equation is an exponential decay function:\n$$\n\\delta h(t) = \\delta h(0) \\exp(-\\alpha \\beta t)\n$$\nSince $\\alpha > 0$ and we are in the regime where $\\beta > 0$, the coefficient $-\\alpha \\beta$ is negative. This guarantees that any small perturbation $\\delta h(t)$ will decay to zero as $t \\to \\infty$, confirming that the steady state $h^{\\ast}$ is stable.\n\nThe characteristic e-folding timescale, $\\tau$, is the time required for the perturbation to decay to $1/e$ of its initial value. By comparing the solution $\\delta h(t) = \\delta h(0) \\exp(-t/\\tau)$ with our derived solution, we can identify the timescale:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau} = \\alpha \\beta\n$$\nTherefore, the characteristic timescale for the system to relax back to steady state is:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{1}{\\alpha \\beta}\n$$\nThe final results for the steady-state thickness $h^{\\ast}$ and the characteristic timescale $\\tau$ are presented below, under the valid regime $P_{0} \\ge \\beta > 0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{0}}{\\beta}\\right) & \\frac{1}{\\alpha \\beta} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2533472"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the physical scale of the soil mantle to its chemical properties, this practice explores the origin of cation exchange capacity ($CEC$), a key indicator of soil fertility.
