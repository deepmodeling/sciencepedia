It describes a classic linear box model, a fundamental construct in the study of dynamical systems, particularly in biogeochemistry and environmental engineering. The underlying principle is the conservation of mass, and the kinetics are described by a standard first-order linear ordinary differential equation. The problem provides all necessary conditions to deduce a unique, stable solution. Therefore, we proceed with the derivation.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Governing Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)**\n\nThe principle of conservation of mass dictates that the time rate of change of a conserved quantity within a defined volume is equal to the total rate of input minus the total rate of output. Let $R(t)$ represent the mass of the tracer in the reservoir at time $t$.\n\nThe rate of change of this mass is given by the derivative $\\frac{dR}{dt}$.\n\nThe rate of input is explicitly given as an exogenous function $F_{\\mathrm{in}}(t)$.\n\nThe rate of output is described as a first-order sink with a rate constant $k > 0$. The well-mixed assumption implies that this loss rate is proportional to the total mass $R(t)$ currently in the reservoir. Thus, the output rate is $k R(t)$.\n\nApplying the conservation principle:\n$$\n\\frac{d R(t)}{dt} = \\text{Inputs} - \\text{Outputs}\n$$\nSubstituting the defined terms, we obtain the governing ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{d R(t)}{dt} = F_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) - k R(t)\n$$\nThe physical interpretation of each term is as follows:\n- $\\frac{dR(t)}{dt}$: This is the instantaneous net rate of change of the tracer mass $R$ within the reservoir.\n- $F_{\\mathrm{in}}(t)$: This is the rate of new mass being added to the reservoir from an external source. It is the forcing term of the system.\n- $-k R(t)$: This is the rate of mass removal from the reservoir. The negative sign signifies a loss or sink. The term's proportionality to $R(t)$ indicates a first-order process, where $k$ is the constant of proportionality, representing the fractional loss rate per unit time (units of time$^{-1}$).\n\n**2. Solution for a Step-Change in Forcing**\n\nFor the time period $t \\ge 0$, the input is stepped to a constant value, $F_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) = F_1$. The governing ODE becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = F_1 - kR\n$$\nThis can be written in the standard form for a first-order linear ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} + kR = F_1\n$$\nTo find the unique solution, we must determine the initial condition $R(0)$. The problem states that for $t < 0$, the system was at steady state with a constant input $F_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) = F_0$. At steady state, the mass is constant, meaning $\\frac{dR}{dt} = 0$. Substituting this into the general ODE for the pre-$0$ conditions:\n$$\n0 = F_0 - k R_{\\mathrm{ss}}\n$$\nwhere $R_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ is the steady-state mass for $t < 0$. Solving for $R_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ gives:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{F_0}{k}\n$$\nThe continuity of mass, a consequence of finite-rate physical processes, requires that $R(t)$ does not change instantaneously. Therefore, the mass at $t=0$ must be equal to the steady-state mass immediately prior to the change. The initial condition is:\n$$\nR(0) = \\frac{F_0}{k}\n$$\nThe general solution to the non-homogeneous ODE is the sum of the homogeneous solution ($R_h$) and a particular solution ($R_p$). The homogeneous equation $\\frac{dR_h}{dt} + kR_h = 0$ yields $R_h(t) = C \\exp(-kt)$, where $C$ is the constant of integration. For the particular solution, since the right-hand side is a constant $F_1$, we can seek a constant solution $R_p(t) = A$. Substituting into the ODE: $0 + kA = F_1$, which gives $A = \\frac{F_1}{k}$.\nThe full general solution is:\n$$\nR(t) = R_h(t) + R_p(t) = C \\exp(-kt) + \\frac{F_1}{k}\n$$\nNow, we apply the initial condition $R(0) = \\frac{F_0}{k}$ to find $C$:\n$$\nR(0) = C \\exp(-k \\cdot 0) + \\frac{F_1}{k} = C + \\frac{F_1}{k}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{F_0}{k} = C + \\frac{F_1}{k} \\implies C = \\frac{F_0}{k} - \\frac{F_1}{k} = \\frac{F_0 - F_1}{k}\n$$\nSubstituting this value of $C$ back into the general solution gives the specific solution for $t \\ge 0$:\n$$\nR(t) = \\left( \\frac{F_0 - F_1}{k} \\right) \\exp(-kt) + \\frac{F_1}{k}\n$$\nThis can be more compactly written as:\n$$\nR(t) = \\frac{1}{k} \\left( F_1 + (F_0 - F_1)\\exp(-kt) \\right)\n$$\n\n**3. Identification of the e-folding Adjustment Time $\\tau$**\n\nThe e-folding time $\\tau$ describes the characteristic time scale for the system's adjustment to its new equilibrium. It is defined by the decay of the deviation of $R(t)$ from its new steady state. The new steady state, $R_{\\infty}$, is approached as $t \\to \\infty$:\n$$\nR_{\\infty} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} R(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left( \\frac{F_1}{k} + \\frac{F_0 - F_1}{k} \\exp(-kt) \\right) = \\frac{F_1}{k}\n$$\nThe deviation from this new steady state is:\n$$\nR(t) - R_{\\infty} = \\left( \\frac{F_1}{k} + \\frac{F_0 - F_1}{k} \\exp(-kt) \\right) - \\frac{F_1}{k} = \\frac{F_0 - F_1}{k} \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThis deviation is proportional to an exponential decay term, $\\exp(-kt)$. The problem defines $\\tau$ such that this decay is proportional to $\\exp(-t/\\tau)$. By direct comparison of the exponential factors:\n$$\n\\exp(-kt) = \\exp(-t/\\tau)\n$$\nEquating the arguments of the exponential function, we find:\n$$\nkt = t/\\tau \\implies k = \\frac{1}{\\tau}\n$$\nTherefore, the e-folding adjustment time is the reciprocal of the first-order rate constant:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{1}{k}\n$$\nThis time scale is also known as the residence time or turnover time of the tracer in the reservoir.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{k} \\left( F_{1} + (F_{0} - F_{1})\\exp(-kt) \\right) & \\frac{1}{k}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2495207"}, {"introduction": "While simplified models provide a broad overview, predictive power often comes from accurately parameterizing key processes within the system.

Operationally, it is the pool accessible to rapid plant uptake and microbial assimilation, often extracted by mild salt solutions. It is kinetically fast and thermodynamically weakly bound.\n\n- Sorbed phosphorus (P): The sorbed pool includes phosphate that is specifically adsorbed to mineral surfaces (for example, iron and aluminum oxides and hydroxides, clays, and carbonates) via inner-sphere complexation or strong outer-sphere binding. This pool is not immediately in solution but can exchange with solution over hours to days and is responsive to changes in solution concentration. It is commonly parameterized by surface complexation or isotherm models.\n\n- Occluded phosphorus (P): Occluded P is phosphate sequestered within sesquioxide (iron/aluminum oxide) nodules, coatings, or microporous domains that are physically or diffusively protected from interaction with bulk solution. It is typically not extractable by mild reagents and displays slow desorption kinetics on ecological timescales.\n\n- Mineral phosphorus (P): The mineral P pool comprises crystalline inorganic phosphate minerals, including primary apatites and secondary Fe/Al/Ca phosphates.

This advanced practice requires you to construct an export coefficient model that integrates land use, hydrology, and in-stream nutrient spiraling [@problem_id:2495121]. More importantly, it pushes you to confront a critical challenge in modeling: assessing whether your model parameters are even identifiable, a crucial test for building robust and reliable predictive tools.", "problem": "You are tasked with deriving, calibrating, and assessing identifiability of a parsimonious watershed export coefficient model for nitrogen and phosphorus under hydrologic control and in-stream spiraling (first-order uptake) for multiple monitoring configurations. The derivation must begin from conservation of mass and the additivity of sources across land-use categories. You must then implement a program that uses your derived model to calibrate export coefficients from synthetic data and to assess local and practical identifiability under limited monitoring designs.\n\nAssumptions and fundamental base:\n- Conservation of mass at the watershed outlet implies that the exported load of a dissolved nutrient equals the sum of terrestrial inputs that reach the stream minus in-stream uptake and losses. Under steady aggregation over a time window, the terrestrial contributions are additive across land-use categories, and in-stream processing can be represented by a first-order areal uptake consistent with nutrient spiraling concepts.\n- Let $c \\in \\{\\mathrm{N}, \\mathrm{P}\\}$ denote the nutrient, $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,K\\}$ denote land-use categories, $s \\in \\{1,\\dots,S\\}$ denote monitoring sites (distinct watersheds), and $t \\in \\{1,\\dots,T\\}$ denote time windows. Let $A_{s,i}$ be the land-use area, $q_{s,t}$ be a specific discharge or hydrologic driver over the time window that scales terrestrial mobilization and advection, and $Q_{s,t}$ be the stream discharge at the outlet for in-stream spiraling. Let $e_{c,i}$ denote the export coefficient for nutrient $c$ and land use $i$.\n- First-order uptake during transport implies a delivery fraction that depends on discharge. For each nutrient $c$, use a hydrologically controlled delivery fraction defined by a Michaelis–Menten-like form that arises from integrating a first-order uptake rate over a characteristic travel time: $D_{c}(Q) = \\dfrac{Q}{Q + k_{c}} = \\dfrac{1}{1 + k_{c}/Q}$, with $k_{c} > 0$ fixed from literature and $Q > 0$. This is a known, well-tested representation of hydrologic control on in-stream spiraling at lumped scales.\n\nTask requirements:\n1. From the above principles, derive a linear-in-parameters export model that expresses the outlet load $L_{c,s,t}$ as a function of $A_{s,i}$, $q_{s,t}$, and $D_{c}(Q_{s,t})$, with unknown parameters $e_{c,i}$ collected into a vector for each nutrient.

The total mass exported, or load $L_{c,s,t}$, is the product of the total mass of the nutrient mobilized from terrestrial sources within the watershed and the fraction of this mass that is delivered to the outlet without being lost to in-stream processes.\n\n1.  **Total Terrestrial Mobilization**: The problem states that terrestrial contributions are additive across $K$ land-use categories. The mobilized load from a given land use $i$ is proportional to its area $A_{s,i}$, a hydrologic driver $q_{s,t}$ representing specific discharge, and a land-use-specific export coefficient $e_{c,i}$. The total mobilized load, $\\text{Input}_{c,s,t}$, is the sum over all land uses:\n    $$\n    \\text{Input}_{c,s,t} = \\sum_{i=1}^{K} e_{c,i} A_{s,i} q_{s,t}\n    $$\n    Here, $e_{c,i}$ are the unknown parameters we wish to determine.\n\n2.  **In-stream Delivery Fraction**: In-stream processes, primarily biological uptake, remove a portion of the mobilized nutrient load during its transport to the outlet. This is represented by a delivery fraction, $D_c(Q)$, which is a function of the stream discharge $Q$. The problem provides a specific functional form for this delivery fraction, derived from first-order uptake kinetics integrated over a characteristic travel time:\n    $$\n    D_{c}(Q_{s,t}) = \\frac{Q_{s,t}}{Q_{s,t} + k_{c}}\n    $$\n    where $Q_{s,t}$ is the stream discharge at the outlet of site $s$ during time $t$, and $k_c$ is a nutrient-specific half-saturation constant for uptake.\n\n3.  **Complete Export Model**: The final exported load $L_{c,s,t}$ is the mobilized load multiplied by the delivery fraction:\n    $$\n    L_{c,s,t} = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{K} e_{c,i} A_{s,i} q_{s,t} \\right) \\cdot D_{c}(Q_{s,t})\n    $$\n    To demonstrate that this model is linear in its parameters, we can distribute the delivery fraction term into the summation:\n    $$\n    L_{c,s,t} = \\sum_{i=1}^{K} e_{c,i} \\left( A_{s,i} q_{s,t} D_{c}(Q_{s,t}) \\right)\n    $$\n    This equation represents the load for a single observation, corresponding to a specific site $s$ and time $t$.\n\n4.  **Matrix Formulation**: To calibrate the model using data from $S$ sites over $T$ time windows (a total of $N_{obs} = S \\cdot T$ observations), we formulate the problem as a system of linear equations, $y_c = X_c \\theta_c$.\n    -   The parameter vector, $\\theta_c$, is a $K$-dimensional column vector containing the unknown export coefficients for nutrient $c$:\n        $$\n        \\theta_c = [e_{c,1}, e_{c,2}, \\dots, e_{c,K}]^{\\top}\n        $$\n    -   The response vector, $y_c$, is an $(S \\cdot T)$-dimensional column vector containing the observed loads, where each element corresponds to a unique $(s,t)$ pair. For a mapping where the observation index is $j = (s-1)T + (t-1)$, then $(y_c)_j = L_{c,s,t}$.\n    -   The design matrix, $X_c$, is an $(S \\cdot T) \\times K$ matrix. Each row corresponds to an observation $(s,t)$, and each column corresponds to a land-use parameter $e_{c,i}$. The entry in the row for $(s,t)$ and column for $i$ is the predictor variable associated with $e_{c,i}$:\n        $$\n        (X_c)_{(s,t), i} = A_{s,i} q_{s,t} D_{c}(Q_{s,t})\n        $$\n    The complete linear system is thus established.\n\n### Part 2: Calibration and Identifiability Assessment\n\nThe problem requires using this model to assess parameter identifiability. This involves constructing the design matrix $X_c$ for each nutrient and analyzing its properties.\n\n-   **Model Construction**: For each test case and each nutrient $c \\in \\{\\mathrm{N}, \\mathrm{P}\\}$, we first construct the design matrix $X_c$. The procedure is as follows:\n    1.  For each site $s$ and time $t$, calculate the total watershed discharge $Q_{s,t} = q_{s,t} \\sum_{i=1}^{K} A_{s,i}$.\n    2.  Calculate the corresponding delivery fraction $D_c(Q_{s,t}) = Q_{s,t} / (Q_{s,t} + k_c)$.\n    3.  Populate the $(S \\cdot T) \\times K$ design matrix $X_c$, where each row, indexed by a unique $(s,t)$ pair, contains the elements $A_{s,i} q_{s,t} D_c(Q_{s,t})$ for $i=1, \\dots, K$.\n\n-   **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Calibration**: While not strictly necessary for the final identifiability checks, the problem requires the implementation of OLS calibration. Given the synthetic load vector $y_c = X_c \\theta_c^*$, the parameter estimate $\\hat{\\theta}_c$ is found by solving the normal equations. For potentially rank-deficient systems, the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse $X_c^{+}$ provides the solution:\n    $$\n    \\hat{\\theta}_c = X_c^{+} y_c\n    $$\n\n-   **Local (Structural) Identifiability**: A unique solution for $\\theta_c$ exists if and only if the columns of the design matrix $X_c$ are linearly independent. This is a structural property of the model and the experimental design. It is assessed by computing the rank of the design matrix. The model is locally identifiable if:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{rank}(X_c) = K\n    $$\n    If $\\mathrm{rank}(X_c) < K$, the parameters are not uniquely determinable, as an infinite number of solutions exist.\n\n-   **Practical Identifiability**: Even if a model is structurally identifiable, the parameters may be difficult to estimate precisely from data due to near-collinearity of the columns of $X_c$. This is assessed using the condition number of the Fisher Information Matrix, which for unweighted OLS is proportional to $F_c = X_c^{\\top} X_c$. The spectral condition number, $\\kappa(F_c)$, is the ratio of the largest to smallest singular values of $F_c$. A large condition number indicates that small changes in the input data (or noise) can lead to large changes in the parameter estimates. The model is deemed practically identifiable if this condition number is below a specified threshold $\\tau$:\n    $$\n    \\kappa(F_c) = \\kappa(X_c^{\\top} X_c) \\le \\tau = 10^8\n    $$\n    If $X_c$ is not full rank, $F_c$ will be singular, and its condition number will be infinite, correctly indicating a lack of practical identifiability.\n\n-   **Final Criterion**: For each test case, the final output is a boolean value which is `true` if and only if the models for *both* nutrient N and nutrient P are both locally and practically identifiable according to the criteria above.\n\nThe provided Python code implements this logic for each of the four test cases. Each case is designed to test a different aspect of identifiability. Case 1 represents a well-designed study with diverse land use and hydrology, leading to identifiability. Case 2, with only one watershed, is structurally non-identifiable because all rows of the design matrix are scalar multiples of the land-use area vector, making the columns linearly dependent. Case 3 has proportional land-use areas across sites, also causing structural non-identifiability. Case 4 demonstrates practical non-identifiability, as a near-proportional land-use structure leads to an ill-conditioned design matrix, even though it is technically full rank.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives, calibrates, and assesses identifiability of a watershed export coefficient model.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define common parameters\n    true_theta_N = np.array([15, 3])\n    true_theta_P = np.array([2, 0.5])\n    k_N = 2.0\n    k_P = 0.5\n    K = 2\n    identifiability_threshold = 1e8\n\n    # Test cases defined in the problem statement\n    test_cases_data = [\n        # Case 1 (happy path, spatial diversity)\n        {\n            \"S\": 3, \"T\": 2,\n            \"A\": np.array([[30, 70], [60, 40], [10, 90]]),\n            \"q\": np.array([[0.5, 0.6, 0.4], [0.2, 0.3, 0.25]]).T # Transpose for (s, t) indexing\n        },\n        # Case 2 (temporal data only, structural non-identifiability)\n        {\n            \"S\": 1, \"T\": 5,\n            \"A\": np.array([[50, 50]]),\n            \"q\": np.array([0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.3, 0.5]).reshape(1, -1)\n        },\n        # Case 3 (proportional land-use mixes, structural non-identifiability)\n        {\n            \"S\": 2, \"T\": 3,\n            \"A\": np.array([[20, 80], [40, 160]]),\n            \"q\": np.array([[0.5, 0.5], [0.3, 0.3], [0.7, 0.7]]).T\n        },\n        # Case 4 (near-proportional land-use, practical non-identifiability)\n        {\n            \"S\": 2, \"T\": 2,\n            \"A\": np.array([[20, 80], [40.000001, 160]]),\n            \"q\": np.array([[0.5, 0.5], [0.3, 0.3]]).T\n        }\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n\n    for case_data in test_cases_data:\n        S = case_data[\"S\"]\n        T = case_data[\"T\"]\n        A = case_data[\"A\"]\n        q = case_data[\"q\"]\n\n        # Track identifiability for both nutrients\n        is_identifiable_N = False\n        is_identifiable_P = False\n\n        # Parameters for N and P\n        nutrients = [('N', k_N, true_theta_N), ('P', k_P, true_theta_P)]\n\n        for nutrient_label, k_c, true_theta_c in nutrients:\n            # Construct the design matrix X_c and response vector y_c\n            num_obs = S * T\n            X_c = np.zeros((num_obs, K))\n            \n            row_idx = 0\n            for s in range(S):\n                for t in range(T):\n                    A_s = A[s, :] # Areas for site s\n                    q_st = q[s, t]\n                    \n                    # Calculate total discharge Q_st\n                    A_s_total = np.sum(A_s)\n                    Q_st = q_st * A_s_total\n                    \n                    # Calculate delivery fraction D_c(Q_st)\n                    D_c = Q_st / (Q_st + k_c)\n                    \n                    # Populate the row of the design matrix\n                    X_c[row_idx, :] = A_s * q_st * D_c\n                    row_idx += 1\n            \n            # Generate synthetic loads y_c (response vector)\n            y_c = X_c @ true_theta_c\n            \n            # Implement OLS calibration using Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse\n            # This step is required by the problem but its result is not used for the final output.\n            theta_hat_c = np.linalg.pinv(X_c) @ y_c\n            \n            # --- Identifiability Assessment ---\n            \n            # 1.
