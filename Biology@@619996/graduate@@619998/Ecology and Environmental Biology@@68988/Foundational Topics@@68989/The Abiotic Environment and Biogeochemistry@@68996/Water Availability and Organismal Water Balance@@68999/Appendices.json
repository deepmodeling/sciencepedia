Treat the leaf as a homogeneous isothermal lamina with constant resistances over the period considered. Assume negligible heat storage in the leaf and negligible conductive heat flux to its petiole. The net all-wave radiation absorbed per one-sided leaf area, denoted by $R_n$, is known, and longwave exchanges are already included in $R_n$. The leaf satisfies a steady-state energy balance of the form $R_n = H + \\lambda E$, where $H$ is the sensible heat flux and $\\lambda E$ is the latent heat flux.\n\nYou may assume the following physically justified relations and definitions:\n- Sensible heat flux obeys a flux-gradient law with an aerodynamic (boundary-layer) resistance $r_a$ common to heat and water vapor: $H = \\rho c_p (T_l - T_a)/r_a$, where $\\rho$ is the air density, $c_p$ is the specific heat capacity of air at constant pressure, $T_l$ is the leaf temperature, and $T_a$ is the air temperature.\n- Water vapor exchange is described by Fickian transport with resistances in series; the total resistance to water vapor diffusion is $r_s + r_a$, where $r_s$ is the surface resistance (stomatal plus cuticular) per one-sided leaf area.

It requires the derivation and application of the Penman-Monteith equation, a fundamental relationship in micrometeorology and plant ecophysiology. The problem contains all necessary information and physical relations, which are based on established first principles, to arrive at a unique solution. I shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the latent heat flux, $\\lambda E$, and its subsequent numerical calculation. The derivation begins with the steady-state energy balance equation for a leaf, provided as:\n$$R_n = H + \\lambda E$$\nwhere $R_n$ is the net absorbed radiation, $H$ is the sensible heat flux, and $\\lambda E$ is the latent heat flux, all expressed per one-sided leaf area.\n\nTwo other primary equations are provided to describe the fluxes. The first is for sensible heat flux, which is an Ohm's law analogue:\n$$H = \\frac{\\rho c_p}{r_a} (T_l - T_a)$$\nHere, $\\rho$ is the density of air, $c_p$ is the specific heat capacity of air, $T_l$ is the leaf temperature, $T_a$ is the ambient air temperature, and $r_a$ is the aerodynamic (boundary-layer) resistance to heat transfer.\n\nThe second is for latent heat flux, which describes Fickian transport of water vapor. The problem states that Fickian transport applies and that the total resistance is the sum of surface resistance $r_s$ and aerodynamic resistance $r_a$. The flux of water vapor, $E$ (mass per unit area per unit time), is proportional to the gradient of water vapor concentration. Using mass mixing ratio, $q$ (mass of water vapor per mass of dry air), the flux is $E = \\rho \\frac{q_l - q_a}{r_s + r_a}$. We can relate the mixing ratio to vapor pressure $e$ using the ideal gas law and the definition of $\\varepsilon$ (ratio of molecular weights of water to dry air), which gives $q \\approx \\frac{\\varepsilon e}{P}$, where $P$ is the total atmospheric pressure.\nSubstituting this into the flux equation gives:\n$$E = \\rho \\frac{\\varepsilon}{P} \\frac{e_s(T_l) - e_a}{r_s + r_a}$$\nwhere $e_s(T_l)$ is the saturation vapor pressure at the leaf surface (at temperature $T_l$) and $e_a$ is the ambient vapor pressure. The latent heat flux is therefore:\n$$\\lambda E = \\frac{\\lambda \\rho \\varepsilon}{P} \\frac{e_s(T_l) - e_a}{r_s + r_a}$$\nThe problem provides the definition of the psychrometric constant, $\\gamma = \\frac{c_p P}{\\varepsilon \\lambda}$. We can rearrange this to find an expression for the term $\\frac{\\lambda \\varepsilon}{P}$:\n$$\\frac{\\lambda \\varepsilon}{P} = \\frac{c_p}{\\gamma}$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $\\lambda E$ yields the conventional form used in biometeorology:\n$$\\lambda E = \\frac{\\rho c_p}{\\gamma} \\frac{e_s(T_l) - e_a}{r_s + r_a}$$\nThe system of equations involves an unknown variable, the leaf temperature $T_l$. To solve for $\\lambda E$, we must eliminate $T_l$. More specifically, we eliminate the temperature difference $(T_l - T_a)$.\n\nFrom the sensible heat flux equation, we can isolate $(T_l - T_a)$:\n$$T_l - T_a = \\frac{r_a H}{\\rho c_p}$$\nThe vapor pressure at the leaf surface, $e_s(T_l)$, is a non-linear function of $T_l$. The problem allows for a linear approximation around $T_a$:\n$$e_s(T_l) \\approx e_s(T_a) + \\Delta (T_l - T_a)$$\nwhere $\\Delta = \\left.\\frac{d e_s}{dT}\\right|_{T_a}$ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve at $T_a$. The vapor pressure difference term in the $\\lambda E$ equation can then be rewritten:\n$$e_s(T_l) - e_a \\approx e_s(T_a) + \\Delta (T_l - T_a) - e_a = (e_s(T_a) - e_a) + \\Delta (T_l - T_a)$$\nThe term $(e_s(T_a) - e_a)$ is defined as the vapor pressure deficit, $D$. Thus:\n$$e_s(T_l) - e_a \\approx D + \\Delta (T_l - T_a)$$\nNow, we substitute this expression back into the equation for $\\lambda E$:\n$$\\lambda E = \\frac{\\rho c_p}{\\gamma (r_s + r_a)} [D + \\Delta (T_l - T_a)]$$\nWe now have a system of two equations with two unknowns, $H$ and $\\lambda E$. We can eliminate $(T_l - T_a)$ by substituting its expression in terms of $H$:\n$$\\lambda E = \\frac{\\rho c_p}{\\gamma (r_s + r_a)} \\left[ D + \\Delta \\left(\\frac{r_a H}{\\rho c_p}\\right) \\right]$$\nExpanding this expression gives:\n$$\\lambda E = \\frac{\\rho c_p D}{\\gamma (r_s + r_a)} + \\frac{\\Delta r_a H}{\\gamma (r_s + r_a)}$$\nNext, we eliminate $H$ using the energy balance equation, $H = R_n - \\lambda E$:\n$$\\lambda E = \\frac{\\rho c_p D}{\\gamma (r_s + r_a)} + \\frac{\\Delta r_a}{\\gamma (r_s + r_a)} (R_n - \\lambda E)$$\nWe can now algebraically solve for $\\lambda E$. First, distribute the last term:\n$$\\lambda E = \\frac{\\rho c_p D}{\\gamma (r_s + r_a)} + \\frac{\\Delta r_a R_n}{\\gamma (r_s + r_a)} - \\frac{\\Delta r_a \\lambda E}{\\gamma (r_s + r_a)}$$\nGroup all terms containing $\\lambda E$ on the left side:\n$$\\lambda E + \\frac{\\Delta r_a \\lambda E}{\\gamma (r_s + r_a)} = \\frac{\\rho c_p D + \\Delta r_a R_n}{\\gamma (r_s + r_a)}$$\nFactor out $\\lambda E$:\n$$\\lambda E \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\Delta r_a}{\\gamma (r_s + r_a)} \\right) = \\frac{\\rho c_p D + \\Delta r_a R_n}{\\gamma (r_s + r_a)}$$\nSimplify the term in parentheses on the left-hand side:\n$$1 + \\frac{\\Delta r_a}{\\gamma (r_s + r_a)} = \\frac{\\gamma (r_s + r_a) + \\Delta r_a}{\\gamma (r_s + r_a)}$$\nThe equation becomes:\n$$\\lambda E \\left( \\frac{\\gamma (r_s + r_a) + \\Delta r_a}{\\gamma (r_s + r_a)} \\right) = \\frac{\\rho c_p D + \\Delta r_a R_n}{\\gamma (r_s + r_a)}$$\nThe denominator $\\gamma (r_s + r_a)$ cancels on both sides, yielding the final expression for $\\lambda E$:\n$$\\lambda E = \\frac{\\Delta r_a R_n + \\rho c_p D}{\\Delta r_a + \\gamma (r_s + r_a)}$$\nThis is the required expression, commonly known as the Penman-Monteith equation, derived solely from the principles and definitions provided.\n\nNow, we proceed with the numerical calculation.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of soil physics and fluid dynamics (Darcy's Law, Young-Laplace equation), is well-posed with sufficient data to reach a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, unambiguous language. The steps outlined provide a clear path to the solution. The problem is free of factual unsoundness, infeasible conditions, or logical contradictions. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is divided into three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\nPart 1: Determination of the minimum active pore radius $r_c$ in the hydrophobic matrix.\n\nWater entry into a hydrophobic pore requires overcoming a capillary pressure barrier. The Young-Laplace equation for the capillary pressure head, $h_c$, in a cylindrical pore of radius $r$ is given by:\n$$h_c = -\\frac{2 \\gamma \\cos\\theta}{\\rho g r}$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the water-air surface tension, $\\theta$ is the solid-liquid contact angle, $\\rho$ is the water density, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. For a pore to become water-filled, the applied hydrostatic pressure head, $H_p$, must be greater than or equal to the capillary entry head, $h_c$. For the hydrophobic matrix, the contact angle is $\\theta_h = 120^{\\circ}$. Since $\\cos(120^{\\circ}) < 0$, the value of $h_c$ is positive, representing a pressure barrier that must be overcome.\n\nThe condition for water to fill a pore of radius $r$ is $H_p \\ge h_c$, which means:\n$$H_p \\ge -\\frac{2 \\gamma \\cos\\theta_h}{\\rho g r}$$\nThis inequality shows that as pore radius $r$ decreases, a larger head $H_p$ is required. Therefore, for a given ponding head $H_p$, there is a minimum radius, $r_c$, that can be filled. All pores with $r \\ge r_c$ will conduct water. The critical radius $r_c$ is found when the equality holds:\n$$r_c = -\\frac{2 \\gamma \\cos\\theta_h}{\\rho g H_p}$$\nSubstituting the given values: $\\gamma = 0.072 \\,\\mathrm{N \\, m^{-1}}$, $\\theta_h = 120^{\\circ}$, $\\rho = 1000 \\,\\mathrm{kg \\, m^{-3}}$, $g = 9.81 \\,\\mathrm{m \\, s^{-2}}$, and $H_p = 0.020 \\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$r_c = -\\frac{2 (0.072 \\,\\mathrm{N \\, m^{-1}}) \\cos(120^{\\circ})}{(1000 \\,\\mathrm{kg \\, m^{-3}})(9.81 \\,\\mathrm{m \\, s^{-2}})(0.020 \\,\\mathrm{m})}$$\nSince $\\cos(120^{\\circ}) = -0.5$:\n$$r_c = -\\frac{2(0.072)(-0.5)}{196.2} \\,\\mathrm{m} = \\frac{0.072}{196.2} \\,\\mathrm{m} \\approx 3.6697 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\mathrm{m}$$\nThis value is within the specified pore radius range of $[r_{\\min}, r_{\\max}]$, where $r_{\\min} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{m}$ and $r_{\\max} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{m}$. Thus, in the hydrophobic matrix, only pores with radii in the interval $[r_c, r_{\\max}]$ are active.\nFor the wettable domain with $\\theta_w = 45^{\\circ}$, $\\cos(45^{\\circ}) > 0$, so $h_c$ is negative, indicating spontaneous capillary uptake. Therefore, all pores in the range $[r_{\\min}, r_{\\max}]$ are active in the wettable domain.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the active conductivity fraction $R$ for the hydrophobic domain.\n\nThe saturated hydraulic conductivity, $K$, is proportional to the integral of $r^4 n(r)$ over the set of active pore radii. The pore radius number density is given as $n(r) = C r^{-3}$. The total potential conductivity of the hydrophobic domain, $K_{h, \\text{total}}$ (equivalent to the base conductivity $K_b$), is proportional to the integral over all possible radii, $[r_{\\min}, r_{\\max}]$:\n$$K_{h, \\text{total}} \\propto \\int_{r_{\\min}}^{r_{\\max}} r^4 n(r) \\,dr = C \\int_{r_{\\min}}^{r_{\\max}} r^4 r^{-3} \\,dr = C \\int_{r_{\\min}}^{r_{\\max}} r \\,dr$$\nThe active conductivity, $K_{h, \\text{active}}$, is proportional to the integral over the water-filled radii, $[r_c, r_{\\max}]$:\n$$K_{h, \\text{active}} \\propto \\int_{r_c}^{r_{\\max}} r^4 n(r) \\,dr = C \\int_{r_c}^{r_{\\max}} r \\,dr$$\nThe fraction $R$ is the ratio of the active conductivity to the total potential conductivity:\n$$R = \\frac{K_{h, \\text{active}}}{K_{h, \\text{total}}} = \\frac{C \\int_{r_c}^{r_{\\max}} r \\,dr}{C \\int_{r_{\\min}}^{r_{\\max}} r \\,dr} = \\frac{\\left[ \\frac{r^2}{2} \\right]_{r_c}^{r_{\\max}}}{\\left[ \\frac{r^2}{2} \\right]_{r_{\\min}}^{r_{\\max}}} = \\frac{r_{\\max}^2 - r_c^2}{r_{\\max}^2 - r_{\\min}^2}$$\nSubstituting the values for the radii:\n$r_{\\max} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{m} \\implies r_{\\max}^2 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{m}^2$\n$r_{\\min} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{m} \\implies r_{\\min}^2 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-12} \\,\\mathrm{m}^2$\n$r_c \\approx 3.6697 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\mathrm{m} \\implies r_c^2 \\approx 1.3467 \\times 10^{-7} \\,\\mathrm{m}^2$\n$$R = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-6}) - (1.3467 \\times 10^{-7})}{(1.0 \\times 10^{-6}) - (1.0 \\times 10^{-12})} = \\frac{8.6533 \\times 10^{-7}}{0.999999 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx 0.86533$$\n\nPart 3: Computation of the effective steady infiltration flux $q_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n\nThe problem states to assume a unit hydraulic gradient ($i=1$) for steady ponded infiltration. Under this condition, Darcy's law simplifies to $q = K$, where $q$ is the flux and $K$ is the hydraulic conductivity. The total effective flux, $q_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is equal to the effective hydraulic conductivity, $K_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, of the composite soil.\nThe two domains (wettable and hydrophobic) act in parallel, so their conductivities are weighted by their respective areal fractions:\n$$K_{\\mathrm{eff}} = f \\cdot K_w + (1-f) \\cdot K_h$$\nwhere $f = 0.10$ is the areal fraction of the wettable domain and $(1-f) = 0.90$ is that of the hydrophobic domain.\n\nThe conductivity of the wettable domain, $K_w$, is fully active, so $K_w = K_b = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\,\\mathrm{m \\, s^{-1}}$.\nThe conductivity of the hydrophobic domain, $K_h$, is only partly active. Its value is $K_h = R \\cdot K_b$, where $K_b$ is the conductivity it would have if it were fully wettable.\nTherefore, the effective conductivity is:\n$$K_{\\mathrm{eff}} = f \\cdot K_b + (1-f) \\cdot R \\cdot K_b = K_b (f + (1-f)R)$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$K_{\\mathrm{eff}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\,\\mathrm{m \\, s^{-1}}) [0.10 + (0.90)(0.86533)]$$\n$$K_{\\mathrm{eff}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-5}) [0.10 + 0.77880] = (1.0 \\times 10^{-5})(0.87880) \\,\\mathrm{m \\, s^{-1}} = 8.7880 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{m \\, s^{-1}}$$\nThe effective flux is $q_{\\mathrm{eff}} = K_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 8.7880 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{m \\, s^{-1}}$.\n\nFinally, we convert the flux to the required units of millimeters per hour ($\\mathrm{mm \\, hr^{-1}}$):\n$$q_{\\mathrm{eff}} (\\mathrm{mm \\, hr^{-1}}) = q_{\\mathrm{eff}} (\\mathrm{m \\, s^{-1}}) \\times \\frac{1000 \\,\\mathrm{mm}}{1 \\,\\mathrm{m}} \\times \\frac{3600 \\,\\mathrm{s}}{1 \\,\\mathrm{hr}}$$\n$$q_{\\mathrm{eff}} = (8.7880 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (1000) \\times (3600) \\,\\mathrm{mm \\, hr^{-1}} = (8.7880 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (3.6 \\times 10^6) \\,\\mathrm{mm \\, hr^{-1}}$$\n$$q_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 31.6368 \\,\\mathrm{mm \\, hr^{-1}}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required gives $31.64 \\,\\mathrm{mm \\, hr^{-1}}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{31.64}$$", "id": "2542380"}]}
