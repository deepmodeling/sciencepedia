The fundamental niche is defined by the condition $r(T)0$. The provided model for the growth rate is:\n$$\nr(T)=r_{\\max}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(T-T_{\\text{opt}})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right)-m\n$$\nThe condition for positive growth is thus:\n$$\nr_{\\max}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(T-T_{\\text{opt}})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right)-m  0\n$$\nTo solve for $T$, we must isolate it.

The given parameters are $r_{\\max}=0.5$ and $m=0.1$, so $\\frac{m}{r_{\\max}} = \\frac{0.1}{0.5} = 0.2$. Since $0.2  1$, a non-empty interval of temperatures for positive growth exists.\n\nWe now take the natural logarithm, $\\ln$, of both sides.

This operation reverses the direction of the inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{(T-T_{\\text{opt}})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}  \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{\\max}}{m}\\right)\n$$\nSince $r_{\\max}  m$, the ratio $\\frac{r_{\\max}}{m}  1$, and its natural logarithm is positive.

It is a clear, self-contained, and scientifically rigorous computational exercise. A solution will be developed.\n\n### Solution Algorithm\nThe solution requires implementing the specified procedure to find the stable equilibrium community structure at each point on the environmental grid $E_m$. This procedure is structured as a search across all possible subsets of \"resident\" species.\n\nFor each point $E$ on the grid, and for each test case, the stable equilibrium state $\\mathbf{N}^\\ast(E) = (N_1^\\ast(E), N_2^\\ast(E), N_3^\\ast(E))$ is determined as follows. The possible subsets of species $\\{1,2,3\\}$ are examined in a specific order: from largest cardinality to smallest, with lexicographical ordering for subsets of the same size. The ordered list of subsets $S$ to check is: $\\{1,2,3\\}$, $\\{1,2\\}$, $\\{1,3\\}$, $\\{2,3\\}$, $\\{1\\}$, $\\{2\\}$, $\\{3\\}$, $\\emptyset$. The first subset in this sequence that satisfies both feasibility and invasion resistance criteria determines the equilibrium.\n\n**1. Feasibility Analysis**\nFor a given candidate resident set $S \\subseteq \\{1,2,3\\}$, the equilibrium abundances $N_i^\\ast$ for $i \\in S$ are found by solving the linear system derived from the condition $\\frac{dN_i}{dt}=0$, which simplifies to:\n$$ \\sum_{j \\in S} \\alpha_{ij} N_j = K_i(E) \\quad \\text{for all } i \\in S $$\nThis can be written in matrix form as $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_S \\mathbf{N}_S = \\mathbf{K}_S(E)$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_S$ is the submatrix of competition coefficients for species in $S$, and $\\mathbf{K}_S(E)$ is the vector of their carrying capacities.\nA solution $\\mathbf{N}_S^\\ast$ is obtained. The set $S$ is deemed **feasible** if all its components are non-negative, i.e., $N_i^\\ast \\ge -\\varepsilon$ for all $i \\in S$, where $\\varepsilon=10^{-9}$ is the numerical tolerance. If the system is singular or if any $N_i^\\ast  -\\varepsilon$, the set $S$ is infeasible and is discarded.\n\n**2. Invasion Resistance Analysis**\nIf a set $S$ is feasible, it must be tested for resistance to invasion by any species $k \\notin S$. For each such potential invader $k$ with $K_k(E)  \\varepsilon$, we calculate the invasion exponent:\n$$ g_k(E) = r_k \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{j \\in S} \\alpha_{kj} N_j^\\ast}{K_k(E)} \\right) $$\nSince $r_k=1$, this simplifies to $g_k(E) = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{j \\in S} \\alpha_{kj} N_j^\\ast}{K_k(E)}$. The equilibrium is **invasion-resistant** if $g_k(E) \\le \\varepsilon$ for all potential invaders $k$. If any invader has $g_k(E)  \\varepsilon$, the equilibrium is unstable, and the set $S$ is discarded.\n\n**3. Final Equilibrium and Output Calculation**\nThe first set $S$ in the ordered search that is both feasible and invasion-resistant determines the system's stable equilibrium. The abundances are given by $\\mathbf{N}_S^\\ast$, with $N_k^\\ast = 0$ for all $k \\notin S$. This process is repeated for every grid point $E_m$.\n\nAfter computing $\\mathbf{N}^\\ast(E_m)$ for all $m$, the final statistics for each species $i$ are calculated:\n-   The number of viable points is the count of grid points where $K_i(E_m)  \\varepsilon$. Let this be $C_{V,i}$.\n-   The number of excluded points is the count of grid points where $K_i(E_m)  \\varepsilon$ and $|N_i^\\ast(E_m)|  \\varepsilon$. Let this be $C_{X,i}$.\n-   The **fraction of exclusion** is $f_i = C_{X,i} / C_{V,i}$, rounded to $3$ decimal places. If $C_{V,i}=0$, then $f_i=0$.\n-   The **number of exclusion segments** $s_i$ is found by creating a boolean array indicating exclusion at each grid point. A segment is a contiguous block of `True` values in this array. The number of such blocks is counted.\n\nThis entire procedure is applied to each of the three test cases provided.

The information contained in the data is therefore information about the function $\\lambda(s)$.\n\nThe intensity is given as a product of several factors:\n$$\n\\lambda(s) \\;=\\; \\rho \\; q(s) \\; \\Psi(s) \\;=\\; \\rho \\; q(s) \\; \\mathbf{1}\\{ r(z(s))  0 \\} \\; B(s) \\; D(s)\n$$\nHere, $\\rho$ is a positive constant, $q(s)  0$ is the sampling effort or detectability, $B(s) \\in [0,1]$ represents biotic filters, $D(s) \\in [0,1]$ represents dispersal filters, and $\\mathbf{1}\\{ r(z(s))  0 \\}$ is the term representing the fundamental niche, $\\mathcal{N}_F$. The fundamental niche is defined in the environmental space, $\\mathcal{N}_F = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{R}^p : r(z)  0 \\}$. Identifying $\\mathcal{N}_F$ is equivalent to identifying the set of environmental conditions $z$ for which $r(z)  0$, or equivalently, identifying the indicator function $\\mathbf{1}\\{ r(z)  0 \\}$ across the range of environments.\n\nThe problem of non-identifiability arises from the multiplicative structure of $\\lambda(s)$. The observed point pattern only provides information about the composite function $\\lambda(s)$. We wish to isolate one of its components, $\\mathbf{1}\\{ r(z(s))  0 \\}$. However, we cannot uniquely determine the factors of a product just by observing the product itself.\n\nSpecifically, if we observe a region where occurrences are absent, which implies $\\lambda(s)$ is zero or near-zero, this could be for several mutually non-exclusive reasons:\n1.  The environment is abiotically unsuitable: $r(z(s)) \\le 0$, so $\\mathbf{1}\\{ r(z(s))  0 \\} = 0$.\n2.  Biotic interactions are exclusionary: $B(s) = 0$. For example, a superior competitor or an effective predator prevents the species from maintaining a population.\n3.  The location is inaccessible due to dispersal barriers: $D(s) = 0$. The species has never been able to reach this location.\n\nSince any of these factors being zero will result in $\\lambda(s) = 0$, we cannot distinguish the cause of an absence from the occurrence data alone. More formally, let us propose a candidate fundamental niche, corresponding to an indicator function $I_1(s) = \\mathbf{1}\\{ r_1(z(s))  0 \\}$. This gives an intensity $\\lambda_1(s) = \\rho_1 q_1(s) B_1(s) D_1(s) I_1(s)$. Now consider a different, smaller candidate niche, $I_2(s) = \\mathbf{1}\\{ r_2(z(s))  0 \\}$. We can always construct a new set of filter functions, for instance $B_2(s)$, such that the observed intensity is identical, $\\lambda_1(s) = \\lambda_2(s)$. For example, wherever $I_1(s)=1$ but $I_2(s)=0$, we can set $B_2(s)$ to be some compensating value while setting $B_1(s)=0$. Since the data cannot distinguish between two different models $(\\mathcal{N}_{F,1}, B_1, D_1, q_1)$ and $(\\mathcal{N}_{F,2}, B_2, D_2, q_2)$ that produce the same $\\lambda(s)$, the fundamental niche $\\mathcal{N}_F$ is not identifiable from occurrence-only data without further assumptions.\n\nTo render $\\mathcal{N}_F$ identifiable, we must impose assumptions that remove the confounding effects. The goal is to find a study domain, $\\Omega \\subseteq \\mathcal{S}$, where the effects of $B(s)$, $D(s)$, and $q(s)$ are either nullified or known. Specifically, if we can establish a domain $\\Omega$ where:\n1.  **Biotic interactions are not limiting:** $B(s) = 1$ for all $s \\in \\Omega$. This means there are no significant competitors, predators, or diseases preventing persistence.\n2.  **Dispersal is not limiting:** $D(s) = 1$ for all $s \\in \\Omega$. This means the area is fully saturated with propagules, and the species has had sufficient time and means to reach all locations within $\\Omega$.\n3.  **Observation process is controlled:** $q(s)$ is known, at least up to a constant multiplicative factor. The simplest case is standardized sampling, where $q(s) = c$ for some constant $c  0$ for all $s \\in \\Omega$.\n\nIf these three conditions are met within $\\Omega$, the intensity function simplifies to:\n$$\n\\lambda(s) = \\rho \\cdot c \\cdot \\mathbf{1}\\{ r(z(s))  0 \\} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = \\rho' \\; \\mathbf{1}\\{ r(z(s))  0 \\} \\quad \\text{for } s \\in \\Omega\n$$\nwhere $\\rho' = \\rho c$ is a new positive constant. Under these conditions, the intensity of observed points $\\lambda(s)$ within the domain $\\Omega$ is non-zero if and only if the location is inside the fundamental niche ($r(z(s))  0$). By observing the boundary of the species' occurrences in environmental space for locations $s \\in \\Omega$, we can delineate the boundary of $\\mathcal{N}_F$. Importantly, these assumptions must be empirically testable through targeted field studies, experiments, or analysis of sampling protocols.\n\nNow, we evaluate the options.\n\n**A.** This option first correctly explains non-identification: \"...any pattern in $\\lambda(s)$ attributed to $\\mathbf{1}\\{ r(z(s))  0 \\}$ can be mimicked by compensatory changes in $B(s)$ or $D(s)$...\". This is a precise statement of the confounding problem. It then proposes a set of identifying assumptions for a domain $\\Omega$: $B(s)=1$ (verified by biotic removal experiments), $D(s)=1$ (verified by dispersal analysis), and $q(s)$ known up to a constant (verified by sampling protocols). It correctly concludes that under these testable conditions, $\\lambda(s) \\propto \\mathbf{1}\\{ r(z(s))  0 \\}$ in $\\Omega$, making $\\mathcal{N}_F$ identifiable there. The logic is sound and fully aligns with the first-principles derivation above. The proposed conditions are indeed empirically testable.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.** This option claims that with enough data, biotic and dispersal limitations will \"average out\" and a machine learning algorithm will find the fundamental niche. This is scientifically incorrect. There is no ecological or mathematical principle stating that biotic and dispersal limitations average out to a constant over large scales. Often, these factors are the primary drivers of broad-scale distributional limits. A machine learning algorithm trained on occurrence data (even with background points) can only learn a function proportional to the observed data-generating process, which is $\\lambda(s)$. It will therefore learn a model for the realized niche as filtered by $B(s)$, $D(s)$, and $q(s)$, not the fundamental niche $\\mathcal{N}_F$. The claim that no explicit assumptions are needed is a direct contradiction of the identifiability problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** This option also provides a valid explanation for non-identification: \"...for any candidate indicator... one can construct alternative $B(s)$ or $D(s)$ that yield the same $\\lambda(s)$...\". This is a formal and correct statement of the problem. It then proposes a specific, powerful method for achieving identification: using a natural experiment in a spatio-temporal domain $\\Omega \\times [t_1,t_2]$. The conditions proposed are $B(s,t)=1$ (e.g., documented pest eradication), $D(s,t)=1$ (validated by independent data like telemetry), and standardized sampling for $q(s,t)$. This is an instantiation of the general strategy outlined in the derivation and in option A. It correctly concludes that $\\lambda(s,t) \\propto \\mathbf{1}\\{ r(z(s))  0 \\}$ in this domain, which identifies $\\mathcal{N}_F$. The conditions are empirically testable.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D.** This option makes two fundamental errors. First, it incorrectly equates using \"pseudo-absences\" with having true presence-absence data. Background points (pseudo-absences) serve as a sample of the available environment, allowing for the estimation of a function proportional to $\\lambda(s)$; they do not provide information that a species is truly absent. Second, it makes the fallacious claim that zeros (absences) \"necessarily imply $r(z) \\le 0$\". This is precisely the core of the non-identifiability problem: an absence can be due to abiotic factors ($r(z) \\le 0$), biotic factors ($B(s)=0$), or dispersal factors ($D(s)=0$). The use of pseudo-absences does not resolve this confounding. Therefore, the conclusion that no assumptions about $B(s)$, $D(s)$, or $q(s)$ are needed is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBoth options A and C provide a correct explanation for non-identifiability and a valid, empirically testable set of assumptions that would render the fundamental niche identifiable.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2494083"}]}
