A solution will be provided.\n\nThe scientific principle governing the relationship between solute concentration and the solute potential ($\\Psi_s$) of an ideal solution is the van 't Hoff equation. This equation is a cornerstone of physical chemistry and its application to biological systems. The relationship is given by:\n$$\n\\Psi_s = -iCRT\n$$\nwhere:\n- $i$ is the van 't Hoff factor, representing the number of osmotically active particles per formula unit of solute. For a non-dissociating solute like proline, $i=1$.\n- $C$ is the molar concentration of the solute in $\\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}$.\n- $R$ is the ideal gas constant.

Since the initial state of the cell is not specified and we are only concerned with the change, we can express the change in solute potential as a function of the change in concentration. The relationship remains linear:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Psi_s = -i(\\Delta C)RT\n$$\nThe problem states that the cell needs to decrease its solute potential by $0.5 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$. A decrease corresponds to a negative change, so $\\Delta\\Psi_s = -0.5 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nWe are tasked with finding the additional concentration, $\\Delta C$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $\\Delta C$:\n$$\n\\Delta C = -\\frac{\\Delta\\Psi_s}{iRT}\n$$\nWe now substitute the given values into this equation.\n- $\\Delta\\Psi_s = -0.5 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$\n- $i = 1$\n- $R = 0.008314 \\ \\mathrm{MPa\\ L\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$\n- $T = 298 \\ \\mathrm{K}$\n\nSubstituting these values yields:\n$$\n\\Delta C = -\\frac{-0.5 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}}{(1) \\cdot (0.008314 \\ \\mathrm{MPa\\ L\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}) \\cdot (298 \\ \\mathrm{K})}\n$$\nThe negative signs cancel, as expected, since an increase in solute concentration must lead to a decrease (a more negative value) in solute potential.\n$$\n\\Delta C = \\frac{0.5}{(0.008314) \\cdot (298)} \\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}\n$$\nFirst, we calculate the value of the product in the denominator:\n$$\nR \\cdot T = (0.008314) \\cdot (298) \\approx 2.477572 \\ \\mathrm{MPa\\ L\\ mol^{-1}}\n$$\nNow, we can calculate $\\Delta C$:\n$$\n\\Delta C = \\frac{0.5}{2.477572} \\approx 0.201810 \\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\Delta C \\approx 0.202 \\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}\n$$\nThis is the additional concentration of proline that the cell must accumulate in its cytosol to decrease its solute potential by the required amount, thus assisting in water uptake under drought conditions.

As soil water potential drops, the tension in the xylem can cause catastrophic failure through cavitation, the formation of air embolisms that block flow. This exercise introduces the concept of a hydraulic vulnerability curve, a critical tool in ecophysiology, challenging you to model the non-linear loss of conductivity and evaluate a plant's hydraulic safety margin under varying levels of stress [@problem_id:2468200].", "problem": "A plant’s xylem vulnerability to cavitation under drought can be described by a widely observed sigmoidal (logistic) relationship between percent loss of hydraulic conductivity (PLC) and xylem water potential, grounded in the definition that loss of conductivity increases as xylem tension (more negative water potential) increases. Let PLC be defined as the fractional loss of conductivity relative to the maximum (well-watered) conductivity, so that if $K(\\Psi)$ is the conductivity at water potential $\\Psi$ and $K_{\\max}$ is the maximum conductivity, then by definition $PLC = 1 - K(\\Psi)/K_{\\max}$.

It explicitly requires conversion, resolving any potential ambiguity. The problem is self-contained and internally consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be constructed.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the Percent Loss of hydraulic Conductivity, $PLC$, at two different xylem water potentials, $\\Psi$, using the provided logistic function. The given function is:\n$$\nPLC(\\Psi) = \\frac{100}{1+\\exp(a(\\Psi - \\Psi_{50}))}\n$$\nThe parameters are given as $a = 5\\ \\mathrm{MPa}^{-1}$ and the water potential at $50\\%$ loss of conductivity, $\\Psi_{50} = -2\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the $PLC$ for a water potential of $\\Psi = -1\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$. This value represents a state of mild water stress, as the water potential is less negative (higher) than the critical midpoint $\\Psi_{50}$.\nSubstituting the values into the equation:\n$$\nPLC(-1) = \\frac{100}{1+\\exp\\big(5 \\cdot (-1 - (-2))\\big)}\n$$\nThe argument of the exponential function is simplified:\n$$\n5 \\cdot (-1 + 2) = 5 \\cdot (1) = 5\n$$\nThus, the expression for $PLC(-1)$ becomes:\n$$\nPLC(-1) = \\frac{100}{1+\\exp(5)}\n$$\nThis gives the value in percent. As per the problem specifications, we must convert this to a unitless decimal fraction by dividing by $100$:\n$$\nPLC_{\\text{fraction}}(-1) = \\frac{1}{100} \\cdot PLC(-1) = \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(5)}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$\nPLC_{\\text{fraction}}(-1) \\approx \\frac{1}{1+148.413159} = \\frac{1}{149.413159} \\approx 0.00669285\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we obtain $0.006693$.\n\nSecond, we calculate the $PLC$ for a water potential of $\\Psi = -3\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$. This value represents severe water stress, as the water potential is more negative (lower) than the critical midpoint $\\Psi_{50}$.\nSubstituting the values into the equation:\n$$\nPLC(-3) = \\frac{100}{1+\\exp\\big(5 \\cdot (-3 - (-2))\\big)}\n$$\nThe argument of the exponential function is simplified:\n$$\n5 \\cdot (-3 + 2) = 5 \\cdot (-1) = -5\n$$\nThus, the expression for $PLC(-3)$ becomes:\n$$\nPLC(-3) = \\frac{100}{1+\\exp(-5)}\n$$\nConverting this to a unitless decimal fraction by dividing by $100$:\n$$\nPLC_{\\text{fraction}}(-3) = \\frac{1}{100} \\cdot PLC(-3) = \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-5)}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$\nPLC_{\\text{fraction}}(-3) \\approx \\frac{1}{1+0.0067379} = \\frac{1}{1.0067379} \\approx 0.993307\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we obtain $0.9933$.\n\nFor the ecological interpretation:\nAt $\\Psi = -1\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$, the loss of conductivity is less than $1\\%$. This corresponds to mild drought conditions under which the plant's water transport system remains almost entirely functional. The water potential is well above the threshold for catastrophic failure, $\\Psi_{50}$.\nAt $\\Psi = -3\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$, the loss of conductivity is over $99\\%$. This indicates catastrophic hydraulic failure due to widespread xylem cavitation. The water potential is far below the $\\Psi_{50}$ threshold, pushing the plant into a state where it can no longer effectively transport water, leading to wilting and likely death if the stress is not alleviated. The high value of the slope parameter, $a=5\\ \\mathrm{MPa}^{-1}$, signifies a very steep transition from a functional to a non-functional state around the midpoint of $\\Psi_{50} = -2\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$, indicating a narrow hydraulic safety margin for this species. A small change in water potential from $-1.5\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$ to $-2.5\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$ would cause a rapid shift from low to high levels of embolism.\n\nThe final answer requires the two unitless decimal fractions in a row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{bmatrix} 0.006693 & 0.9933 \\end{bmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2468200"}, {"introduction": "Moving from water balance in plants to energy balance in animals, this final practice examines how organisms cope with thermal stress.
