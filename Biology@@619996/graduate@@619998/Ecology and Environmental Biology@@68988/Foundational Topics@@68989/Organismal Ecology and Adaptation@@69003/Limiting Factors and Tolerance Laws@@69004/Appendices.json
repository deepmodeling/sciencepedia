This practice provides a direct, quantitative application of this law to predict the growth rate of a phytoplankton species based on the availability of essential nutrients.

Field measurements report resource supplies of $R_{N} = 5$ mmol N m$^{-3}$ and $R_{P} = 0.2$ mmol P m$^{-3}$. At the low concentrations relevant here, the potential specific growth rate contribution from each nutrient scales approximately linearly with its ambient concentration, with species-specific coefficients $b_{N} = 0.1$ d$^{-1}$ per mmol N m$^{-3}$ and $b_{P} = 0.8$ d$^{-1}$ per mmol P m$^{-3}$.

It is scientifically sound, grounded in the established ecological principle of Liebig's law of the minimum, and provides a complete and consistent set of parameters necessary for a unique, quantitative solution. There are no logical contradictions, factual errors, or ambiguities. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe core principle governing this system is Liebig's law of the minimum, which posits that for essential, non-substitutable resources, the overall rate of a biological process is determined by the resource that is least available in proportion to the organism's requirements. In this context, the realized specific growth rate of the phytoplankton, denoted by $\\mu$, is constrained by the minimum of the potential specific growth rates supported by each nutrient individually. Let $\\mu_{N}$ be the potential growth rate limited by nitrogen ($N$) and $\\mu_{P}$ be the potential growth rate limited by phosphorus ($P$). The realized growth rate is thus:\n$$ \\mu = \\min(\\mu_{N}, \\mu_{P}) $$\nThe problem states that the potential growth rates scale linearly with the ambient nutrient concentrations. The equations for the potential specific growth rates are:\n$$ \\mu_{N} = b_{N} R_{N} $$\n$$ \\mu_{P} = b_{P} R_{P} $$\nwhere $R_{N}$ and $R_{P}$ are the resource concentrations and $b_{N}$ and $b_{P}$ are the species-specific growth coefficients.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Resource supply of Nitrogen: $R_{N} = 5$ mmol N m$^{-3}$\n- Resource supply of Phosphorus: $R_{P} = 0.2$ mmol P m$^{-3}$\n- Growth coefficient for Nitrogen: $b_{N} = 0.1$ d$^{-1}$ (mmol N m$^{-3}$)$^{-1}$\n- Growth coefficient for Phosphorus: $b_{P} = 0.8$ d$^{-1}$ (mmol P m$^{-3}$)$^{-1}$\n\nWe now compute the potential specific growth rate for each nutrient.\n\nFor Nitrogen:\n$$ \\mu_{N} = b_{N} R_{N} = (0.1 \\text{ d}^{-1} (\\text{mmol N m}^{-3})^{-1}) \\times (5 \\text{ mmol N m}^{-3}) = 0.5 \\text{ d}^{-1} $$\nFor Phosphorus:\n$$ \\mu_{P} = b_{P} R_{P} = (0.8 \\text{ d}^{-1} (\\text{mmol P m}^{-3})^{-1}) \\times (0.2 \\text{ mmol P m}^{-3}) = 0.16 \\text{ d}^{-1} $$\nApplying Liebig's law, we compare the two potential growth rates to determine the actual, realized growth rate of the phytoplankton species:\n$$ \\mu = \\min(\\mu_{N}, \\mu_{P}) = \\min(0.5 \\text{ d}^{-1}, 0.16 \\text{ d}^{-1}) $$\nThe minimum of these two values is $0.16 \\text{ d}^{-1}$.\n$$ \\mu = 0.16 \\text{ d}^{-1} $$\nBecause the potential growth rate supported by phosphorus, $\\mu_{P}$, is lower than that supported by nitrogen, $\\mu_{N}$, we conclude that phosphorus is the limiting nutrient for this phytoplankton species under the specified conditions.\n\nThe problem requires the final specific growth rate to be expressed in d$^{-1}$ and rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is $0.16$. To express this value with three significant figures, we must include a trailing zero, which is significant in this context. Therefore, the specific growth rate is $0.160$ d$^{-1}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.160}$$", "id": "2504508"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the principle of a single limiting factor, this exercise shifts the focus from instantaneous growth rates to the ultimate carrying capacity ($K$) of a population.

This practice challenges you to define the carrying capacity as a function of multiple resources and to calculate the critical resource ratio at which the ecosystem switches from being limited by one nutrient to another.", "problem": "A single phytoplankton species grows in a closed, well-mixed mesocosm where its persistence is governed by two essential, non-substitutable resources: nitrate (denote its stock by $R_{1}$) and phosphate (denote its stock by $R_{2}$). Assume stoichiometric homeostasis: each individual requires fixed quotas of nitrate and phosphate to build one unit of biomass, and the environment remains within the species’ physiological tolerance window so that these quotas are constant. There are no external inputs or losses of the resources other than uptake into biomass, and all resource taken up is converted to biomass with fixed yields. Let $\\alpha_{1}$ be the cell yield per unit nitrate and $\\alpha_{2}$ be the cell yield per unit phosphate, both measured as cells per millimole. \n\nStarting from conservation of mass and the definition of essential resources (both are required in fixed proportions per individual), derive the functional dependence of the carrying capacity $K(R_{1},R_{2})$ on $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ under a minimum limitation assumption that is consistent with the essential-nutrient requirement and stoichiometric homeostasis.

It is a standard problem in ecological stoichiometry that draws upon the fundamental principle of Liebig's Law of the Minimum. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or factual inaccuracies. The problem is therefore valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe system is a closed mesocosm containing a single phytoplankton species whose growth is dependent on two essential, non-substitutable resources: nitrate, with stock $R_{1}$, and phosphate, with stock $R_{2}$. The yield of phytoplankton cells per unit of each resource is given by the constants $\\alpha_{1}$ (cells per millimole of nitrate) and $\\alpha_{2}$ (cells per millimole of phosphate). The carrying capacity, $K$, represents the maximum sustainable population size (number of cells) in the given environment.\n\nAccording to the principle of conservation of mass, the total biomass that can be produced is limited by the availability of the essential resources. Since the resources are essential and non-substitutable, and the system exhibits stoichiometric homeostasis (fixed cellular quotas), the growth of the population will be limited by the single resource that is scarcest in relation to the organism's requirements. This is an explicit statement of Liebig's Law of the Minimum.\n\nFirst, let us determine the potential carrying capacity if each resource were the sole limiting factor. If nitrate were the only limiting resource, the total number of cells that could be produced from the available stock $R_{1}$ is given by the product of the resource stock and the yield:\n$$K_{1} = \\alpha_{1} R_{1}$$\nHere, $K_{1}$ is the carrying capacity as dictated by nitrate availability alone.\n\nSimilarly, if phosphate were the only limiting resource, the total number of cells that could be produced from the available stock $R_{2}$ is:\n$$K_{2} = \\alpha_{2} R_{2}$$\nHere, $K_{2}$ is the carrying capacity as dictated by phosphate availability alone.\n\nThe \"minimum limitation assumption\" requires that the actual carrying capacity of the system, $K(R_{1}, R_{2})$, is determined by the lower of these two potential values. The population will cease to grow when the first resource is exhausted. Therefore, the functional dependence of the carrying capacity on the two resource stocks is:\n$$K(R_{1}, R_{2}) = \\min(K_{1}, K_{2}) = \\min(\\alpha_{1} R_{1}, \\alpha_{2} R_{2})$$\nThis expression represents the solution to the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we must determine the critical phosphate stock, denoted $R_{2}^{\\ast}$, at which the identity of the limiting resource switches. This transition occurs at the point of co-limitation, where both resources would be exhausted simultaneously, meaning the potential carrying capacities supported by each resource are equal. We find this critical point by setting $K_{1}$ equal to $K_{2}$:\n$$\\alpha_{1} R_{1} = \\alpha_{2} R_{2}$$\nThe problem asks for the critical phosphate stock $R_{2}^{\\ast}$ for a fixed value of $R_{1}$. We solve the co-limitation equation for $R_{2}$:\n$$R_{2} = \\frac{\\alpha_{1}}{\\alpha_{2}} R_{1}$$\nThis specific value of $R_{2}$ is the critical stock, $R_{2}^{\\ast}$. Thus:\n$$R_{2}^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha_{1}}{\\alpha_{2}} R_{1}$$\nIf the actual phosphate stock $R_{2}$ is less than $R_{2}^{\\ast}$, then $\\alpha_{2} R_{2} < \\alpha_{1} R_{1}$, and phosphate is the limiting resource. If $R_{2}$ is greater than $R_{2}^{\\ast}$, then $\\alpha_{2} R_{2} > \\alpha_{1} R_{1}$, and nitrate is the limiting resource.\n\nFinally, we are required to evaluate $R_{2}^{\\ast}$ numerically using the provided values:\n$\\alpha_{1} = 3.0 \\times 10^{9}$ cells per millimole\n$\\alpha_{2} = 5.0 \\times 10^{10}$ cells per millimole\n$R_{1} = 0.80$ millimoles per liter\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $R_{2}^{\\ast}$:\n$$R_{2}^{\\ast} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{9}}{5.0 \\times 10^{10}} \\times 0.80$$\nWe perform the calculation:\n$$R_{2}^{\\ast} = \\frac{3.0}{50} \\times 0.80 = 0.06 \\times 0.80 = 0.048$$\nThe units are (cells/mmol) / (cells/mmol) $\\times$ (mmol/L), which correctly results in mmol/L. The problem specifies that the answer must be rounded to three significant figures. Therefore, the numerical value is $0.0480$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0480}$$", "id": "2504516"}, {"introduction": "An organism's success is governed not only by the availability of resources but also by its tolerance to ambient physical and chemical conditions, a concept formalized in Shelford's Law of Tolerance.
