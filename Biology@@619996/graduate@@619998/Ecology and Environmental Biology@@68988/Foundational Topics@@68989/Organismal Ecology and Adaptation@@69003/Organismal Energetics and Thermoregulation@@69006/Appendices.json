The fundamental principle governing this system is the first law of thermodynamics, or conservation of energy, applied to the animal as a control volume at steady state.\n\nThe problem states that the animal’s core body temperature, $T_{b}$, is constant. This signifies a steady-state condition where the rate of change of stored energy in the body is zero. The energy balance for the animal can be expressed as:\n$$\\frac{dE_{storage}}{dt} = H_{M} - H_{loss} - P_{work}$$\nwhere $H_{M}$ is the rate of metabolic heat production, $H_{loss}$ is the rate of heat loss to the environment, and $P_{work}$ is the rate of external mechanical work done by the animal.\nGiven steady state, $\\frac{dE_{storage}}{dt} = 0$.

This simplifies the energy balance equation to:\n$$H_{M} = H_{loss}$$\nThis means that to maintain a constant body temperature, the rate of metabolic heat generation must be exactly equal to the rate of heat loss.\n\nThe problem states that sensible heat loss is proportional to the core-to-environment temperature difference. This physically corresponds to a combined form of Newton's law of cooling and the Stefan-Boltzmann law (for radiation, linearized for small temperature differences), and is expressed as:\n$$H_{loss} = C \\cdot (T_{b} - T_{a})$$\nHere, $C$ is the thermal conductance, $T_{b} = 37\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ is the core body temperature, and $T_{a} = 5\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ is the ambient air temperature.

The rate of change of the animal's internal energy, $C \\frac{dT_{b}}{dt}$, must equal the net rate of heat gain. The heat gains are from internal metabolic heat production, $M$, and net heat exchange with the environment.
