A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Correct Rescaling**\n\nLet $L(T, M, P) = \\log W(T, M, P)$. The assumption of separability of $W$ implies additivity for $L$:\n$$L(T, M, P) = \\log(W_T(T)W_M(M)W_P(P)) = \\log W_T(T) + \\log W_M(M) + \\log W_P(P)$$\nLet us denote $L_i(x_i) = \\log W_i(x_i)$ for $i \\in \\{T, M, P\\}$. Thus, $L(x_T, x_M, x_P) = L_T(x_T) + L_M(x_M) + L_P(x_P)$.\n\nThe point $(\\theta_T, \\theta_M, \\theta_P)$ is an optimum, which means the first partial derivatives of $L$ are zero at this point:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_i} \\bigg|_{x_i=\\theta_i} = \\frac{dL_i}{dx_i} \\bigg|_{x_i=\\theta_i} = 0 $$\nThe problem requires using a local quadratic approximation of $\\log W$. We perform a second-order Taylor expansion of $L$ around the optimum $(\\theta_T, \\theta_M, \\theta_P)$.\n$$ L(x_T, x_M, x_P) \\approx L(\\theta_T, \\theta_M, \\theta_P) + \\sum_i \\frac{dL_i}{dx_i}\\bigg|_{\\theta_i} (x_i - \\theta_i) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_i \\frac{d^2L_i}{dx_i^2}\\bigg|_{\\theta_i} (x_i - \\theta_i)^2 $$\nDue to the optimum condition and separability (which makes mixed partials zero), this simplifies to:\n$$ L(\\mathbf{x}) \\approx L(\\mathbf{\\theta}) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_i H_{ii} (x_i - \\theta_i)^2 $$\nwhere $H_{ii} = \\frac{d^2L_i}{dx_i^2}\\big|_{\\theta_i}$ is the second derivative (curvature) of the log-fitness function along axis $i$. Since $(\\theta_T, \\theta_M, \\theta_P)$ is a maximum, we must have $H_{ii}  0$.\n\nA level set of $L$ is a surface where $L(\\mathbf{x}) = C$ for some constant $C$. In our approximation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_i H_{ii} (x_i - \\theta_i)^2 = C - L(\\mathbf{\\theta}) = \\text{const'} $$\nThis is the equation of an ellipsoid centered at $\\mathbf{\\theta}$. The goal is to find a rescaling $y_i = \\phi_i(x_i)$ that transforms these ellipsoidal level sets into spheres. A simple and appropriate transformation is a linear scaling centered at the optimum: $y_i = c_i (x_i - \\theta_i)$, where $c_i$ are a set of scaling constants. From this, $(x_i - \\theta_i) = y_i/c_i$. Substituting into the level set equation:\n$$ \\sum_i H_{ii} \\left(\\frac{y_i}{c_i}\\right)^2 = 2\\cdot\\text{const'} \\implies \\sum_i \\frac{H_{ii}}{c_i^2} y_i^2 = \\text{const''} $$\nFor this to describe a sphere, the coefficients of $y_i^2$ must be equal. Let us set them to a convenient constant, $-1$.\n$$ \\frac{H_{ii}}{c_i^2} = -1 \\implies c_i^2 = -H_{ii} \\implies c_i = \\sqrt{-H_{ii}} $$\nThe desired rescaling is therefore $y_i = \\sqrt{-H_{ii}}(x_i - \\theta_i)$, which can be written as $y_i = \\frac{x_i - \\theta_i}{1/\\sqrt{-H_{ii}}}$.\n\nNext, we must determine $H_{ii}$ from the provided physiological tolerance data. The data states that for each axis $i$, $W_i(\\theta_i \\pm \\delta_i) = r \\cdot W_i(\\theta_i)$. Taking the natural logarithm (as suggested by the format of option B):\n$$ \\ln(W_i(\\theta_i \\pm \\delta_i)) = \\ln(r) + \\ln(W_i(\\theta_i)) \\implies L_i(\\theta_i \\pm \\delta_i) = \\ln r + L_i(\\theta_i) $$\nNow, we apply our quadratic approximation for $L_i(x_i)$ at $x_i = \\theta_i \\pm \\delta_i$:\n$$ L_i(\\theta_i \\pm \\delta_i) \\approx L_i(\\theta_i) + \\frac{1}{2} H_{ii} ((\\theta_i \\pm \\delta_i) - \\theta_i)^2 = L_i(\\theta_i) + \\frac{1}{2} H_{ii} \\delta_i^2 $$\nEquating the two expressions for $L_i(\\theta_i \\pm \\delta_i)$:\n$$ L_i(\\theta_i) + \\ln r = L_i(\\theta_i) + \\frac{1}{2} H_{ii} \\delta_i^2 \\implies \\ln r = \\frac{1}{2} H_{ii} \\delta_i^2 $$\nSolving for $H_{ii}$:\n$$ H_{ii} = \\frac{2 \\ln r}{\\delta_i^2} $$\nNow we can find the scaling denominator, which we will call $\\tau_i$:\n$$ \\tau_i = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{-H_{ii}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{-\\frac{2 \\ln r}{\\delta_i^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{-2 \\ln r}}{\\delta_i}} = \\frac{\\delta_i}{\\sqrt{-2 \\ln r}} $$\nThe final transformation is $y_i = \\frac{x_i - \\theta_i}{\\tau_i}$. This matches the form proposed in option B. This transformation is fundamental because a Gaussian function has the form $f(x) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$. The log of this is $\\text{const} - \\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}$. The curvature (second derivative) is $-\\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}$. Thus, $\\sigma^2 = -1/H_{ii}$, and the standard deviation is $\\sigma = 1/\\sqrt{-H_{ii}}$. Our derived scaling factor, $\\tau_i$, is precisely the standard deviation of the Gaussian fitness curve implied by the quadratic approximation. Thus, the transformation $y_i = (x_i - \\theta_i)/\\tau_i$ converts each variable into a standard score relative to its fitness-function-width.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n-   **A. Standardize each axis by the sample mean and standard deviation (standard deviation (SD)) of environmental observations from field sites: $y_i=\\dfrac{x_i-\\mu_i}{s_i}$, where $\\mu_i$ and $s_i$ are the sample mean and SD of $x_i$ across sites.**\n    This rescaling is based on the distribution of environmental variables in a set of sampled sites, not on the physiological response of the organism. The mean $\\mu_i$ and standard deviation $s_i$ of an environment are independent of the organism's optimum $\\theta_i$ and tolerance, which is represented by its fitness function $W$. The field sites may not even include the physiological optimum. This transformation does not use the information about $W$ and thus cannot be expected to make its level sets spherical.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **B. Use the physiological tolerance information to infer local curvature of $\\log W$: if $W(\\theta_i\\pm \\delta_i)=r\\,W(\\theta_i)$, set $\\tau_i=\\dfrac{\\delta_i}{\\sqrt{-2\\ln r}}$ and define $y_i=\\dfrac{x_i-\\theta_i}{\\tau_i}$ for $i\\in\\{T,M,P\\}$.**\n    This option precisely matches the result of our rigorous derivation. The centering is at the fitness optimum $\\theta_i$. The scaling factor $\\tau_i$ is derived directly from the local curvature of the log-fitness function, correctly inferred from the physiological data $(\\delta_i, r)$. By construction, this transformation maps the ellipsoidal level sets of the quadratic approximation of $\\log W$ into spheres in the $y$-space, centered at the origin. It also makes the gradient magnitudes comparable, as $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}}L \\approx -\\mathbf{y}$, so the partial derivative $\\partial L/\\partial y_i \\approx -y_i$.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **C. Min–max rescale each axis to the unit interval based on the tolerance limits: $y_i=\\dfrac{x_i-(\\theta_i-\\delta_i)}{(\\theta_i+\\delta_i)-(\\theta_i-\\delta_i)}=\\dfrac{x_i-\\theta_i+\\delta_i}{2\\delta_i}$, so that $y_i\\in[0,1]$ on the tolerated range.**\n    This transformation rescales the interval $[\\theta_i - \\delta_i, \\theta_i + \\delta_i]$ to $[0, 1]$. We can rewrite it as $y_i - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{x_i - \\theta_i}{2\\delta_i}$. The level set equation $\\sum_i H_{ii} (x_i - \\theta_i)^2 = \\text{const}$ becomes $\\sum_i H_{ii} (2\\delta_i (y_i - 1/2))^2 = \\text{const}$. Substituting $H_{ii} = \\frac{2 \\ln r}{\\delta_i^2}$, the coefficient of $(y_i - 1/2)^2$ is $H_{ii} (2\\delta_i)^2_i = (\\frac{2 \\ln r}{\\delta_i^2})(4\\delta_i^2) = 8 \\ln r$. Since this coefficient is independent of $i$, this transformation also results in spherical level sets, centered at $(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)$ in the $y$-space. However, the scaling is based on $\\delta_i$, which itself depends on the arbitrary choice of $r$ ($\\delta_i \\propto \\sqrt{-\\ln r}$). The scaling factor $\\tau_i$ in option B is invariant to the choice of $r$ used in the assay, because $\\tau_i = \\delta_i / \\sqrt{-2\\ln r} = 1/\\sqrt{-H_{ii}}$, which depends only on the intrinsic curvature. Option B's scaling is therefore more fundamental and robust than C's. Hence, B is the \"best\" choice.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D. Apply heterogeneous, unit-specific transforms: $y_T=\\dfrac{T-\\theta_T}{s_T}$, $y_M=\\log(M)-\\log(\\theta_M)$, and $y_P=\\log(P)-\\log(\\theta_P)$, mixing logarithmic and variance-based scalings to reduce skew and equalize dispersion.**\n    This option is an ad-hoc mixture of transformations. The scaling for temperature uses $s_T$, the environmental standard deviation, which is incorrect for the reasons stated in A. The logarithmic transformations for $M$ and $P$ presuppose that the fitness curve is symmetric on a logarithmic scale (i.e., log-normal), which contradicts the problem's premise of a symmetric deviation $\\delta_i$ on the original scale. There is no first-principles justification for this mix of transforms based on the problem statement.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2498806"}, {"introduction": "Ecologists have long distinguished between the *fundamental niche*—the full range of environmental conditions a species can tolerate—and the *realized niche*, the portion it actually occupies due to interactions and dispersal limits.

The estimator under infinite sampling, $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\mu}]$, is the geometric centroid of the realized niche, $R$. The realized niche $R$ is the portion of the ellipse\n$$ \\frac{e_{1}^{2}}{a^{2}} + \\frac{e_{2}^{2}}{b^{2}} \\le 1 $$\nfor which the first coordinate is non-negative, i.e., $e_{1} \\ge 0$.

The area of the full ellipse $H$ is $\\pi ab$. Since $R$ is exactly half of the ellipse, its area is:\n$$ \\text{Area}(R) = \\iint_{R} dA = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi a b $$\n\nNext, we compute the numerator for $\\hat{\\mu}_{2}$. The region $R$ is symmetric with respect to the $e_{1}$-axis (the line $e_{2}=0$). The integrand $f(e_{1},e_{2})=e_{2}$ is an odd function with respect to $e_{2}$. Therefore, the integral of an odd function over a symmetric domain is zero:\n$$ \\iint_{R} e_{2} \\,dA = 0 $$\nThis implies that the second coordinate of the centroid is $\\hat{\\mu}_{2} = 0$. This is expected due to the symmetry of the region.\n\nNow, we compute the numerator for $\\hat{\\mu}_{1}$:\n$$ \\iint_{R} e_{1} \\,dA = \\iint_{R} e_{1} \\,de_{1}de_{2} $$\nWe can set up the integral over the right half of the ellipse.

There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or logical flaws. We proceed directly to the derivation.\n\nThe true environmental occupancy distribution, or fundamental niche, is a bivariate normal probability density function $f_{\\mathbf{X}}(\\mathbf{x})$, where $\\mathbf{X} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma})$.

The observed density of presences, $f_{\\text{obs}}(\\mathbf{x})$, is proportional to the product of the true occupancy density and the sampling effort function:\n$$\nf_{\\text{obs}}(\\mathbf{x}) \\propto f_{\\mathbf{X}}(\\mathbf{x}) w(\\mathbf{x})\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the normal density and the effort model, we have:\n$$\nf_{\\text{obs}}(\\mathbf{x}) \\propto \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\sqrt{|\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}|}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{x}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu})^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1}(\\mathbf{x}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu})\\right) \\exp(\\beta T)\n$$\nSince the pre-exponential factor $\\frac{1}{2\\pi \\sqrt{|\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}|}}$ is a constant, we can absorb it into the proportionality constant. The core of the problem lies in the exponent. Let us combine the exponential terms:\n$$\nf_{\\text{obs}}(\\mathbf{x}) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{x}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu})^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1}(\\mathbf{x}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}) + \\beta T\\right)\n$$\nThe term $\\beta T$ can be written in vector form. Let $\\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\beta \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Then $\\beta T = \\beta \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} T \\\\ P \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{b}^{\\top}\\mathbf{x}$. The exponent is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E} = -\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{x}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu})^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1}(\\mathbf{x}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}) + \\mathbf{b}^{\\top}\\mathbf{x}\n$$\nWe expand the quadratic form:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E} = -\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{x}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1}\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{\\mu} - \\boldsymbol{\\mu}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1}\\mathbf{x} + \\boldsymbol{\\mu}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{\\mu}) + \\mathbf{b}^{\\top}\\mathbf{x}\n$$\nSince $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1}\\mathbf{x}$ is a scalar, it equals its transpose $\\mathbf{x}^{\\top}(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1})^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = \\mathbf{x}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ because $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1}$ is symmetric.
