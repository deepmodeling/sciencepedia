This result is independent of the specific values of $R_{0}$ and $T$, and thus is the same for both life histories.\n\nAn elasticity of $-1$ signifies that a given percentage change in generation time $T$ will result in an equal percentage change in the intrinsic rate of increase $r$, but in the opposite direction.

A fixed energy budget: $E = n z$, where $E=10$.\n2.  A minimum per-offspring provisioning level: $z \\ge z_{\\min}$, where $z_{\\min}=1$.\n\nFirst, we reduce the problem to a single-variable maximization problem. From the budget constraint, we can express the clutch size $n$ as a function of the per-offspring investment $z$:\n$$n(z) = \\frac{E}{z}$$\nSubstituting this expression and the given survival function, $s(z) = 1 - \\exp(-k z)$, into the fitness function $W$, we obtain fitness as a function of $z$ alone:\n$$W(z) = \\frac{E}{z} \\left(1 - \\exp(-k z)\\right)$$\nThe optimization problem is now to maximize $W(z)$ subject to the constraint $z \\ge 1$. Since $E=10$ is a positive constant, maximizing $W(z)$ is equivalent to maximizing $\\frac{W(z)}{E} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-kz)}{z}$.\n\nTo find if an interior optimum exists for $z>0$, we must find the critical points of $W(z)$ by taking its derivative with respect to $z$ and setting it to zero.

A trivial solution is $x=0$, which corresponds to $z=0$. To determine if other solutions exist, we examine the function $f(x) = \\exp(x) - (x+1)$. Its derivative is $f'(x) = \\exp(x) - 1$.\n- For $x > 0$, $f'(x) > 0$, so $f(x)$ is strictly increasing.\n- For $x < 0$, $f'(x) < 0$, so $f(x)$ is strictly decreasing.\nThis shows that $f(x)$ has a global minimum at $x=0$, where $f(0) = \\exp(0) - (0+1) = 0$. Therefore, for any $x \\neq 0$, we have $f(x) > 0$, which means $\\exp(x) > x+1$.\nConsequently, the only real solution to $(kz+1) = \\exp(kz)$ is $kz=0$. Since $k>0$, this implies $z=0$. A solution at $z=0$ is not a biologically meaningful interior optimum; it corresponds to an infinite clutch size of zero-provisioned offspring with zero survival.\n\nFurthermore, for any $z>0$, $kz>0$, which implies $\\exp(kz) > kz+1$. Dividing by the positive term $\\exp(kz)$ yields $1 > (kz+1)\\exp(-kz)$. This can be rearranged to:\n$$(kz+1)\\exp(-kz) - 1 < 0$$\nThis demonstrates that the term in the brackets in the derivative expression is always negative for $z>0$.\n$$\\frac{dW}{dz} = \\frac{E}{z^2} \\times (\\text{a negative value}) < 0 \\quad \\text{for all } z > 0$$\nThe finding that $\\frac{dW}{dz} < 0$ for all $z>0$ is critical. It establishes that the fitness function $W(z)$ is a strictly monotonically decreasing function of per-offspring investment $z$ over its entire valid domain.\n\nThe task is to maximize this monotonically decreasing function $W(z)$ on the interval defined by the constraint $z \\ge z_{\\min} = 1$. A monotonically decreasing function on a closed interval attains its maximum value at the lowest possible value of its argument. Therefore, the optimal investment $z^*$ must be at the lower boundary of the permissible domain.\n$$z^* = z_{\\min} = 1$$\nThis is the optimal per-offspring provisioning.\n\nThe corresponding optimal clutch size, $n^*$, is found using the budget constraint:\n$$n^* = \\frac{E}{z^*} = \\frac{10}{1} = 10$$\nThus, the optimal strategy is to produce a clutch of $10$ offspring, each provisioned with $1$ unit of energy.\n\nFinally, we must evaluate how an increase in the parameter $k$ alters the optimal provisioning $z^*$. The parameter $k$ quantifies the efficiency of converting investment into survival. Our derivation shows that for any $k>0$, the fitness function $W(z)$ is always monotonically decreasing in $z$. The optimization result is therefore a corner solution, determined entirely by the boundary constraint $z_{\\min}$ and not by the specific value of $k$. An increase in $k$ will increase the value of the maximum fitness $W(z^*)$ but will not change the location $z^*$ of that maximum. Therefore, the optimal provisioning level $z^*$ is independent of $k$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 10 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2503195"}, {"introduction": "Real-world life cycles are complex, with age- or stage-specific rates of survival and reproduction.
