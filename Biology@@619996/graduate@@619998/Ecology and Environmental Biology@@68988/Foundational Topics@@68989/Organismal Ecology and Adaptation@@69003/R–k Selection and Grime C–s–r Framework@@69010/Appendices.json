The tasks—deriving a known analytical solution and performing a standard sensitivity analysis—are mathematically well-posed and scientifically relevant. The problem is therefore deemed valid. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe first objective is to find a closed-form expression for the time, $t$, for a population to grow from an initial density $N_0$ to a target density $N_T$. The governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) is:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right) $$\nThis is a separable ODE. We rearrange the terms to separate variables $N$ and $t$:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{N\\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right)} = r \\, dt \\implies \\frac{K \\, dN}{N(K-N)} = r \\, dt $$\nThe left-hand side is integrated using partial fraction decomposition. We set $\\frac{K}{N(K-N)} = \\frac{A}{N} + \\frac{B}{K-N}$. Multiplying by $N(K-N)$ yields $K = A(K-N) + BN$. Setting $N=0$ gives $K=AK$, so $A=1$. Setting $N=K$ gives $K=BK$, so $B=1$.

Population growth is described by the logistic equation: $$\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right)$$ where $r$ is the intrinsic rate of increase and $K$ is the carrying capacity.\n2.  Life-history involves trade-offs in allocation to growth, reproduction, and survival.\n3.  The C–S–R framework links life-history strategies to environmental conditions: Ruderal (high disturbance, high resource), Stress-tolerator (low disturbance, low resource/high stress), and Competitor (low disturbance, high resource/low stress).\n4.

The core of the task is to correctly link experimental manipulations to the selective pressures described by the theories.\n\n*   **$r$-selection**: Occurs when population density is low ($N \\ll K$). The per-capita growth rate, $(1/N)dN/dt = r(1 - N/K)$, approximates $r$. Selection favors maximization of $r$, leading to traits such as rapid development, early age at first reproduction, high fecundity, and numerous small propagules. In the C–S–R framework, this corresponds to the **Ruderal (R)** strategy, which is favored in environments with high resource availability and frequent disturbance. An experimental analog for disturbance is periodic culling or harvesting that keeps the population density low.\n\n*   **$K$-selection**: Occurs when population density is high ($N \\approx K$). Competition for resources is intense. Selection favors traits that enhance competitive ability and survival efficiency under crowding, thereby increasing the carrying capacity $K$. Such traits include larger body size, delayed reproduction, and investment in fewer, larger, and more competitive offspring. In the C–S–R framework, this corresponds to the **Competitor (C)** strategy when resources are high (low stress) and disturbance is low. When resources are low (high stress) and disturbance is low, it corresponds to the **Stress-tolerator (S)** strategy, which is also a form of $K$-selection focused on survival and efficiency in a chronically resource-poor environment.\n\nLet us analyze each option based on this synthesis.\n\n**A.

Maintaining low density via thinning correctly imposes $r$-selection. Allowing populations to reach $K$ correctly imposes $K$-selection. This design is methodologically sound.\n*   **Predictions and Mapping**:\n    *   Low density, high resource ($r$-selection, Ruderal): Predicts earlier reproduction, high fecundity, small seeds. This is correct.\n    *   High density, high resource ($K$-selection, Competitor): Predicts delayed reproduction, larger seeds, competitive ability. This is correct. Iteroparity (repeated reproduction) can also be favored under $K$-selection as it spreads risk over time.\n    *   Low resource (Stress-tolerator): Predicts slower growth, stress tolerance, and larger seeds (for better seedling establishment in a poor environment), which is a key trait of stress-tolerators. This prediction is also sound. The statement that the high-density, low-resource condition imposes the strongest $K$-selection pressure (combining density and resource limitation) is a logical conclusion.\n*   **Assays**: Proposed assays for measuring $r$ and performance near $K$ are direct tests of the evolutionary outcomes predicted by the theory.\n*   **Conclusion**: This option presents a fully coherent and scientifically rigorous experimental plan with correct theoretical predictions and mappings.\n*   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Maintain all mesocosms at a constant census number by replacing any removed or dead individuals each week, but manipulate nutrient availability only (high vs. low). Predict that high nutrient conditions will select for higher $r$ traits (earlier reproduction, higher fecundity), while low nutrient conditions will select for higher $K$ traits (larger seeds, delayed reproduction), independent of density, because resource limitation alone generates $K$-selection.**\n\n*   **Experimental Design**: The design is critically flawed. By maintaining a constant census number, the experiment artificially removes density-dependent selection. The core mechanism of $r$–$K$ selection, which arises from the feedback between population density $N$ and per-capita growth rate, is eliminated.\n*   **Predictions**: The predictions are based on a misunderstanding. While resources affect the values of the parameters $r$ and $K$, the selective dichotomy between $r$- and $K$-*selection* is driven by density. Attributing $r$-selection to high nutrients and $K$-selection to low nutrients independent of density is an incorrect simplification.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Start the experiment with different initial sowing densities (low vs. high) and different nutrient levels (low vs. high), but each week equalize density across all mesocosms to a common target by transplanting individuals. Predict that high initial density will select for higher $r$ traits (to escape crowding) and that low initial density will select for higher $K$ traits (to capitalize on resources), with resource effects being minor compared to the transient density effect.**\n\n*   **Experimental Design**: Like option B, this design is flawed. By equalizing density weekly, any selective differential due to density is promptly erased. Evolution requires consistent selective pressure over generations. A transient weekly effect is insufficient.\n*   **Predictions**: The predictions are inverted. High density selects for $K$-traits, not $r$-traits. Low density selects for $r$-traits, not $K$-traits. The rationale is confused and contradicts the fundamental theory.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Implement a $2 \\times 2$ design manipulating density and nutrients as in A, but predict that low density with high resource will favor delayed reproduction and larger seeds (to exploit abundant resources fully), while high density with low resource will favor very high fecundity with smaller seeds (to flood the environment), because producing many small propagules is the best response to scarcity and crowding. Map these respectively to competitor-like and ruderal-like syndromes, and measure success solely by total seed number produced per mesocosm at the end of each generation.**\n\n*   **Experimental Design**: The $2 \\times 2$ setup is appropriate.\n*   **Predictions and Mapping**: The predictions are diametrically opposed to established theory.\n    *   Low density, high resource (the ideal environment for $r$-selection) is predicted to favor $K$-selected traits (delayed reproduction, large seeds). This is wrong. Maximizing $r$ requires rapid and prolific reproduction.\n    *   High density, low resource (a highly competitive, stressful environment favoring $K$-selection/stress tolerance) is predicted to favor $r$-selected traits (high fecundity, small seeds). This is also wrong; this environment favors competitive efficiency and survival, typically via larger, well-provisioned offspring.\n    *   The mapping is also incorrect: (low density, high resource) is mapped to Competitor instead of Ruderal, and (high density, low resource) is mapped to Ruderal, which is completely wrong as Ruderals require low density/high disturbance.\n*   **Assays**: Measuring only total seed number is an insufficient metric that cannot distinguish between different reproductive strategies.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, Option A is the only one that presents a methodologically sound experiment with predictions and theoretical mappings that are fully consistent with the principles of life-history theory.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2526998"}]}
