The census interval is one year. Individuals can remain in their current stage or grow to the next stage between censuses; there is no retrogression. Adults reproduce, and their offspring enter the seedling stage by the next census. The following annual vital rates are estimated from long-term demographic data:\n\n- Seedling stasis: a seedling remains a seedling with probability $0.4$.\n- Seedling growth: a seedling becomes a juvenile with probability $0.3$.\n- Juvenile stasis: a juvenile remains a juvenile with probability $0.6$.\n- Juvenile growth: a juvenile becomes an adult with probability $0.2$.\n- Adult stasis (survival): an adult remains an adult with probability $0.8$.\n- Fecundity: each adult produces an average of $4$ recruits that survive to be counted as seedlings at the next census; juveniles and seedlings do not reproduce.\n\n1) Using only the core definition that the next-year population vector $\\mathbf{n}_{t+1}$ is given by the stage projection matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ applied to the current population vector $\\mathbf{n}_{t}$ via $\\mathbf{n}_{t+1}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{n}_{t}$, and that an entry $a_{ij}$ of $\\mathbf{A}$ is the expected number of stage-$i$ individuals at time $t+1$ produced by one stage-$j$ individual at time $t$, construct the $3\\times 3$ Lefkovitch matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ with stage order $(L,J,A)$.\n\n2) From first principles of linear population models and the Perron–Frobenius theorem for nonnegative primitive matrices, compute the dominant eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of $\\mathbf{A}$, which is the asymptotic per-year multiplicative growth rate of the population.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We shall proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part solution: $1$) construction of the stage projection matrix, $2$) calculation of its dominant eigenvalue, and $3$) determination and interpretation of the associated right and left eigenvectors.\n\nPart 1: Construction of the Lefkovitch Matrix $\\mathbf{A}$\n\nThe population is structured into three stages: seedling ($L$), juvenile ($J$), and adult ($A$). The state of the population at time $t$ is given by the vector $\\mathbf{n}_{t} = \\begin{pmatrix} n_L(t) \\\\ n_J(t) \\\\ n_A(t) \\end{pmatrix}$. The dynamics are governed by the linear recurrence relation $\\mathbf{n}_{t+1} = \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{n}_{t}$, where $\\mathbf{A}$ is the $3 \\times 3$ Lefkovitch matrix. The entry $a_{ij}$ of $\\mathbf{A}$ represents the per-capita contribution of individuals in stage $j$ at time $t$ to stage $i$ at time $t+1$. The stage order is specified as ($L, J, A$).\n\nWe construct the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ using the provided vital rates:\n-   $a_{11}$: Contribution from seedling to seedling. This is the seedling stasis probability, given as $0.4$.\n-   $a_{12}$: Contribution from juvenile to seedling. Juveniles do not reproduce, so this entry is $0$.\n-   $a_{13}$: Contribution from adult to seedling. This is the fecundity, given as an average of $4$ new seedlings per adult.\n-   $a_{21}$: Contribution from seedling to juvenile. This is the seedling growth probability, given as $0.3$.\n-   $a_{22}$: Contribution from juvenile to juvenile. This is the juvenile stasis probability, given as $0.6$.\n-   $a_{23}$: Contribution from adult to juvenile. There is no retrogression, so adults cannot become juveniles. This entry is $0$.\n-   $a_{31}$: Contribution from seedling to adult. Seedlings must pass through the juvenile stage, so they cannot become adults in a single time step. This entry is $0$.\n-   $a_{32}$: Contribution from juvenile to adult. This is the juvenile growth probability, given as $0.2$.\n-   $a_{33}$: Contribution from adult to adult. This is the adult stasis (survival) probability, given as $0.8$.\n\nCombining these entries, the Lefkovitch matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.4  0  4 \\\\ 0.3  0.6  0 \\\\ 0  0.2  0.8 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the Dominant Eigenvalue $\\lambda$\n\nThe long-term asymptotic growth rate of the population is given by the dominant eigenvalue of $\\mathbf{A}$. The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are the roots of the characteristic equation, $\\det(\\mathbf{A} - \\lambda\\mathbf{I}) = 0$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix.\n\n$$\n\\det\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0.4  0  4 \\\\ 0.3  0.6  0 \\\\ 0  0.2  0.8 \\end{pmatrix} - \\lambda \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0 \\\\ 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 0.4-\\lambda  0  4 \\\\ 0.3  0.6-\\lambda  0 \\\\ 0  0.2  0.8-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\nWe compute the determinant using cofactor expansion along the first row:\n$$\n(0.4-\\lambda) \\begin{vmatrix} 0.6-\\lambda  0 \\\\ 0.2  0.8-\\lambda \\end{vmatrix} - 0 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} 0.3  0 \\\\ 0  0.8-\\lambda \\end{vmatrix} + 4 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} 0.3  0.6-\\lambda \\\\ 0  0.2 \\end{vmatrix} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(0.4-\\lambda)((0.6-\\lambda)(0.8-\\lambda) - 0) + 4((0.3)(0.2) - 0) = 0\n$$\n$$\n(0.4-\\lambda)(0.48 - 1.4\\lambda + \\lambda^2) + 0.24 = 0\n$$\n$$\n0.192 - 0.56\\lambda + 0.4\\lambda^2 - 0.48\\lambda + 1.4\\lambda^2 - \\lambda^3 + 0.24 = 0\n$$\nThis simplifies to the characteristic polynomial:\n$$\n-\\lambda^3 + 1.8\\lambda^2 - 1.04\\lambda + 0.432 = 0\n$$\nOr, multiplying by $-1$:\n$$\n\\lambda^3 - 1.8\\lambda^2 + 1.04\\lambda - 0.432 = 0\n$$\nThe matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is non-negative and primitive (as $\\mathbf{A}^2$ has all strictly positive entries), so the Perron-Frobenius theorem guarantees the existence of a unique, simple, real, and positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ which is strictly greater in magnitude than all other eigenvalues. This $\\lambda_1$ is the asymptotic population growth rate. The cubic equation must be solved numerically. The real root is found to be:\n$$\n\\lambda \\approx 1.2428\n$$\nThe other two roots are a complex conjugate pair with magnitude less than $\\lambda$. Rounding to four significant figures as requested, the dominant eigenvalue is $1.243$.\n\nPart 3: Stable Stage Distribution and Reproductive Value\n\nThe stable stage distribution is the right eigenvector $\\mathbf{w}$ corresponding to the dominant eigenvalue $\\lambda$. It satisfies $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{w} = \\lambda\\mathbf{w}$. The components of $\\mathbf{w}$ represent the stable proportions of individuals in each stage.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0.4  0  4 \\\\ 0.3  0.6  0 \\\\ 0  0.2  0.8 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} w_L \\\\ w_J \\\\ w_A \\end{pmatrix} = \\lambda \\begin{pmatrix} w_L \\\\ w_J \\\\ w_A \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis yields a system of linear equations. We can solve for the ratios of the components. For instance, from the third row, $0.2w_J + 0.8w_A = \\lambda w_A$, which gives $w_J = \\frac{\\lambda - 0.8}{0.2} w_A$. Using $\\lambda \\approx 1.2428$, we find $w_J \\approx 2.214 w_A$. From the second row, $0.3w_L + 0.6w_J = \\lambda w_J$, which gives $w_L = \\frac{\\lambda - 0.6}{0.3} w_J$. This gives $w_L \\approx 2.143 w_J \\approx 4.745 w_A$. The eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} 4.745 \\\\ 2.214 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Normalizing so the components sum to $1$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{w} = \\frac{1}{4.745 + 2.214 + 1} \\begin{pmatrix} 4.745 \\\\ 2.214 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.596 \\\\ 0.278 \\\\ 0.126 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nEcologically, this vector describes the population's structure at equilibrium: it will consist of approximately $59.6\\%$ seedlings, $27.8\\%$ juveniles, and $12.6\\%$ adults. This is a population-level emergent property.\n\nThe reproductive value vector is the left eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}$ corresponding to $\\lambda$. It satisfies $\\mathbf{v}^T\\mathbf{A} = \\lambda\\mathbf{v}^T$. The components measure the relative contribution of an individual in each stage to future population growth.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} v_L  v_J  v_A \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.4  0  4 \\\\ 0.3  0.6  0 \\\\ 0  0.2  0.8 \\end{pmatrix} = \\lambda \\begin{pmatrix} v_L  v_J  v_A \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis gives another system of equations. Normalizing such that the reproductive value of an adult is $1$ ($v_A = 1$), we use the third column equation: $4v_L + 0.8v_A = \\lambda v_A$, which gives $v_L = \\frac{\\lambda - 0.8}{4} v_A \\approx 0.111$. From the second column equation: $0.6v_J + 0.2v_A = \\lambda v_J$, which gives $v_J = \\frac{0.2}{\\lambda - 0.6} v_A \\approx 0.311$.\nThe reproductive value vector is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.111 \\\\ 0.311 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nEcologically, a juvenile is worth about $31.1\\%$ of an adult, and a seedling is worth about $11.1\\%$ of an adult, in terms of their respective expected contributions to future generations. This reflects the probability of surviving and reaching the reproductive adult stage. This, too, is a population-level concept, determined by the life history trade-offs across all stages.\n\nThe final required answer is the numerical value of the dominant eigenvalue $\\lambda$.\n$$\n\\lambda \\approx 1.243\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.243}$$", "id": "2502393"}, {"introduction": "After modeling a single population, we now scale up to the community level, which is characterized by a web of interspecific interactions. This practice explores the classic ecological question of whether complexity begets stability, using the theoretical framework pioneered by Robert May. By deriving a stability criterion from a random community matrix, you will gain hands-on experience with the principles of random matrix theory and its profound implications for understanding the structure of large ecological systems [@problem_id:2502382].", "problem": "A species community is modeled near an interior equilibrium by the linearized system of ordinary differential equations $\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}/\\mathrm{d}t = J \\mathbf{x}$, where $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^S$ is the vector of species deviations from equilibrium and $J \\in \\mathbb{R}^{S \\times S}$ is the community (Jacobian) matrix. Assume that self-regulation is uniform and negative so that $J = -d I_S + A$ with $d0$ and $I_S$ the $S \\times S$ identity matrix. The off-diagonal matrix $A$ encodes interspecific interaction strengths for a community of richness $S$ and connectance $C$, defined as the probability that a given off-diagonal entry is nonzero. More precisely, for $i \\neq j$, the entries $a_{ij}$ of $A$ are independent and identically distributed with probability $C$ of being drawn from a distribution with mean $0$ and variance $\\sigma^2$, and with probability $(1-C)$ they are $0$. Diagonal entries of $A$ are $0$.\n\nUsing the local stability criterion for linear systems (that all eigenvalues of $J$ must have negative real parts) and well-tested random matrix results about the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of large independent-entry matrices with finite variance, derive the large-$S$ condition under which the community is locally asymptotically stable in terms of $S$, $C$, $d$, and $\\sigma$.

Explain briefly which moment(s) of the interaction-strength distribution control the bulk stability threshold in this limit.\n\nFinally, express the maximum allowable standard deviation of interaction strengths, $\\sigma_{\\max}$, as a closed-form function of $S$, $C$, and $d$ that guarantees local asymptotic stability in the large-$S$ limit. Provide your final answer as a single analytic expression for $\\sigma_{\\max}$ with no inequality. No numerical evaluation is required.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It represents a canonical problem in theoretical ecology amenable to analysis using random matrix theory. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe dynamics of the system near equilibrium are given by the linear system $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = J \\mathbf{x}$. The local asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point requires that all eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix $J$ have negative real parts.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix $J$ is defined as $J = -d I_S + A$, where $d  0$ is the uniform self-regulation strength, $I_S$ is the $S \\times S$ identity matrix, and $A$ is the matrix of interspecific interactions. Let $\\lambda_J$ be an eigenvalue of $J$ with corresponding eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}$. Then, by definition:\n$$J \\mathbf{v} = \\lambda_J \\mathbf{v}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $J$:\n$$(-d I_S + A) \\mathbf{v} = \\lambda_J \\mathbf{v}$$\n$$-d \\mathbf{v} + A \\mathbf{v} = \\lambda_J \\mathbf{v}$$\n$$A \\mathbf{v} = (\\lambda_J + d) \\mathbf{v}$$\nThis equation shows that $(\\lambda_J + d)$ is an eigenvalue of the matrix $A$. Let us denote an eigenvalue of $A$ as $\\lambda_A$. Thus, we have the relationship $\\lambda_A = \\lambda_J + d$, which implies $\\lambda_J = \\lambda_A - d$.\n\nThe stability condition is $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_J)  0$ for all eigenvalues of $J$. Using the relationship derived above, this condition becomes:\n$$\\text{Re}(\\lambda_A - d)  0$$\nSince $d$ is a positive real constant, this is equivalent to:\n$$\\text{Re}(\\lambda_A)  d$$\nThis means the community is locally asymptotically stable if and only if the real parts of all eigenvalues of the interaction matrix $A$ are strictly less than the self-regulation strength $d$. Stability is therefore determined by the eigenvalue of $A$ with the largest real part.\n\nWe now analyze the spectral properties of the random matrix $A$ in the large-$S$ limit. The diagonal entries of $A$ are $a_{ii} = 0$. The off-diagonal entries $a_{ij}$ for $i \\neq j$ are independent and identically distributed random variables. With probability $C$, an entry $a_{ij}$ is drawn from a distribution with mean $0$ and variance $\\sigma^2$. With probability $(1-C)$, the entry is $0$.\n\nLet us determine the mean and variance of the off-diagonal entries $a_{ij}$. The mean is:\n$$E[a_{ij}] = C \\cdot E[\\text{nonzero entry}] + (1-C) \\cdot 0 = C \\cdot 0 + 0 = 0$$\nThe variance is calculated using the law of total variance or by direct computation of the second moment:\n$$E[a_{ij}^2] = C \\cdot E[(\\text{nonzero entry})^2] + (1-C) \\cdot 0^2 = C \\cdot (\\sigma^2 + 0^2) = C \\sigma^2$$\nTherefore, the variance is:\n$$\\text{Var}(a_{ij}) = E[a_{ij}^2] - (E[a_{ij}])^2 = C \\sigma^2 - 0^2 = C \\sigma^2$$\nSo, the matrix $A$ is a large random matrix whose off-diagonal entries are i.i.d. with mean $0$ and variance $C \\sigma^2$.\n\nFor large random matrices with independent entries having zero mean and finite variance, a central result from random matrix theory (specifically, Girko's circular law and its generalizations by Tao, Vu, and others) states that the bulk of the eigenvalues, in the limit $S \\to \\infty$, are uniformly distributed within a disk in the complex plane centered at the origin. The radius of this disk, $R_A$, for the unscaled matrix $A$ is given by $R_A = \\sqrt{S \\cdot \\text{Var}(a_{ij})}$.\n\nSubstituting the variance we calculated:\n$$R_A = \\sqrt{S C \\sigma^2}$$\nThis result holds under the specified condition $SC \\to \\infty$, which ensures that the expected number of connections per species, $(S-1)C \\approx SC$, grows large, making the matrix sufficiently connected for the theorem to apply.\n\nThe bulk of the eigenvalues $\\lambda_A$ thus satisfy $|\\lambda_A| \\le \\sqrt{S C \\sigma^2}$. This implies that the maximum real part of any eigenvalue in the bulk is equal to the radius of the disk:\n$$\\max_{\\lambda_A \\in \\text{bulk}} \\text{Re}(\\lambda_A) = \\sqrt{S C \\sigma^2}$$\n(Note: Outlier eigenvalues can exist, but for this class of matrices, they do not extend beyond the bulk edge along the real axis).\n\nCombining this with the stability condition $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_A)  d$, we obtain the large-$S$ stability criterion:\n$$\\sqrt{S C \\sigma^2}  d$$\nThis is the condition under which the community is locally asymptotically stable.\n\nThe problem asks which moments of the interaction-strength distribution control this threshold. The radius of the spectral disk, and thus the stability boundary, depends on $\\text{Var}(a_{ij}) = C\\sigma^2$. This variance is determined by the mean and variance of the underlying distribution from which nonzero interactions are drawn. The theorems establishing the circular law for the spectral bulk rely on the first two moments (mean and variance) of the matrix entry distribution, provided certain technical conditions (like a Lindeberg-type condition on higher moments to prevent heavy tails) are met. Therefore, in this large-$S$ limit, the bulk stability threshold is controlled entirely by the **first and second moments** of the interaction strength distribution. Higher moments affect finer properties of the spectrum, such as the distribution of eigenvalues near the edge or the behavior of outliers, but not the location of the bulk boundary itself.\n\nFinally, we must find the maximum allowable standard deviation of interaction strengths, $\\sigma_{\\max}$, that guarantees stability. This is found at the boundary of the stability region, where the inequality becomes an equality:\n$$\\sqrt{S C \\sigma_{\\max}^2} = d$$\nWe solve for $\\sigma_{\\max}$:\n$$S C \\sigma_{\\max}^2 = d^2$$\n$$\\sigma_{\\max}^2 = \\frac{d^2}{S C}$$\n$$\\sigma_{\\max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{d^2}{S C}} = \\frac{d}{\\sqrt{S C}}$$\nThis expression gives the maximum standard deviation of the nonzero interaction strengths for which the large community remains stable.

The formula is:\n$$ OR_{MH} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=A,B} \\frac{a_i d_i}{n_i}}{\\sum_{i=A,B} \\frac{b_i c_i}{n_i}} $$\nwhere $n_i = a_i + b_i + c_i + d_i$ is the total sample size in stratum $i$.\n\nFirst, we find the total sample sizes for each stratum:\n$n_A = 19 + 1 + 900 + 100 = 1020$.\n$n_B = 60 + 940 + 1 + 19 = 1020$.\n\nNow, we calculate the numerator and denominator of the $OR_{MH}$ formula:\nNumerator:\n$$ \\sum_{i} \\frac{a_i d_i}{n_i} = \\frac{19 \\times 100}{1020} + \\frac{60 \\times 19}{1020} = \\frac{1900}{1020} + \\frac{1140}{1020} = \\frac{3040}{1020} $$\nDenominator:\n$$ \\sum_{i} \\frac{b_i c_i}{n_i} = \\frac{1 \\times 900}{1020} + \\frac{940 \\times 1}{1020} = \\frac{900}{1020} + \\frac{940}{1020} = \\frac{1840}{1020} $$\nThe Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio is the ratio of these two quantities:\n$$ OR_{MH} = \\frac{3040/1020}{1840/1020} = \\frac{3040}{1840} = \\frac{304}{184} = \\frac{38}{23} $$\nThe exact value of the adjusted odds ratio is $\\frac{38}{23}$. Converting this to a decimal gives approximately $1.6521739$. Rounding to four significant figures, as requested, yields $1.652$. This adjusted odds ratio is greater than $1$, which is consistent with the stratum-specific analyses and represents the estimate of the causal effect of Forest habitat on species presence odds, having controlled for the confounding effect of Stratum $S$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.652}$$", "id": "2502384"}]}
