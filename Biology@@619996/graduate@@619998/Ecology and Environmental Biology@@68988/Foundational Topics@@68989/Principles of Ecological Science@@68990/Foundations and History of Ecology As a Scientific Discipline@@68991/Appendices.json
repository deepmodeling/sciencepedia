It is a standard exercise in mathematical demography based on the foundational work of Leslie. All provided data are consistent and sufficient for a solution. We may proceed.\n\nThe problem asks for several related tasks concerning a Leslie population projection model. We will address each in turn. The age-structured population projection is given by the linear, time-invariant system $\\mathbf{n}_{t+1} = \\mathbf{A}\\,\\mathbf{n}_t$, where the projection matrix is\n$$\n\\mathbf{A} \\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.3 & 1.2 & 0.8 \\\\\n0.5 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0.6 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe entries $a_{1j}$ represent age-specific fertilities $F_j$, and the subdiagonal entries $a_{i+1,i}$ represent age-specific survival probabilities $S_i$.\n\nFirst, we must justify the roles of the dominant eigenvalue and its associated eigenvectors. The population vector at time $t$ is given by $\\mathbf{n}_t = \\mathbf{A}^t \\mathbf{n}_0$. The Leslie matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is non-negative. It is also primitive, as the greatest common divisor of the indices of the non-zero fertility terms ($F_1 > 0, F_2 > 0, F_3 > 0$) is $\\text{gcd}\\{1, 2, 3\\} = 1$. The Perron-Frobenius theorem for primitive non-negative matrices guarantees the existence of a unique positive eigenvalue $\\lambda$, the dominant or Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue, which is strictly greater in magnitude than all other eigenvalues. The corresponding right eigenvector $\\mathbf{w}$ and left eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}$ are unique (up to scaling) and have strictly positive components.\n\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, the behavior of $\\mathbf{A}^t$ is dominated by its largest eigenvalue. Any initial population vector $\\mathbf{n}_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^3_{\\ge 0}$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenvectors of $\\mathbf{A}$. For large $t$, the term corresponding to $\\lambda$ will dominate all others, leading to the asymptotic approximation $\\mathbf{n}_t \\approx c \\lambda^t \\mathbf{w}$, where the constant $c$ depends on the initial state $\\mathbf{n}_0$. The total population size at time $t$ grows according to the ratio $\\frac{\\sum_i (\\mathbf{n}_{t+1})_i}{\\sum_i (\\mathbf{n}_t)_i} \\approx \\frac{\\sum_i c\\lambda^{t+1}w_i}{\\sum_i c\\lambda^t w_i} = \\lambda$. Thus, $\\lambda$ is the asymptotic per-time-step growth factor of the population. The stable age distribution is the proportional composition of the population vector, which for large $t$ approaches $\\frac{\\mathbf{n}_t}{\\|\\mathbf{n}_t\\|_1} \\approx \\frac{c\\lambda^t\\mathbf{w}}{\\|c\\lambda^t\\mathbf{w}\\|_1} = \\frac{\\mathbf{w}}{\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|_1}$, i.e., the normalized right Perron eigenvector. The left Perron eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}$ represents the reproductive values of the age classes. The total reproductive value of the population is the scalar product $\\mathbf{v}^\\top\\mathbf{n}_t$. Its dynamics are given by $\\mathbf{v}^\\top\\mathbf{n}_{t+1} = \\mathbf{v}^\\top(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{n}_t) = (\\mathbf{v}^\\top\\mathbf{A})\\mathbf{n}_t = (\\lambda\\mathbf{v}^\\top)\\mathbf{n}_t = \\lambda(\\mathbf{v}^\\top\\mathbf{n}_t)$. This shows that total reproductive value grows exactly by the factor $\\lambda$ in each time step.\n\nNext, we compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The characteristic equation is $\\det(\\mathbf{A} - \\lambda\\mathbf{I}) = 0$.\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n0.3 - \\lambda & 1.2 & 0.8 \\\\\n0.5 & -\\lambda & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0.6 & -\\lambda\n\\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\nExpanding the determinant gives the characteristic polynomial:\n$$ (0.3 - \\lambda)(-\\lambda)(-\\lambda) - 1.2(0.5(-\\lambda) - 0) + 0.8(0.5 \\cdot 0.6 - 0) = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2(0.3 - \\lambda) + 0.6\\lambda + 0.24 = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^3 - 0.3\\lambda^2 - 0.6\\lambda - 0.24 = 0 $$\nThis cubic equation has one positive real root, which is the dominant eigenvalue $\\lambda$. The equation does not have a simple rational root. Solving it numerically, for instance with the Newton-Raphson method, yields $\\lambda \\approx 1.070206$. For subsequent calculations, we will use the value $\\lambda \\approx 1.0702$.\n\nThe unnormalized right eigenvector $\\mathbf{w}$ satisfies $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{w} = \\lambda\\mathbf{w}$. Let $\\mathbf{w} = (w_1, w_2, w_3)^\\top$.\nFrom the second and third rows of the matrix equation:\n$0.5 w_1 = \\lambda w_2 \\implies w_2 = \\frac{0.5}{\\lambda} w_1$\n$0.6 w_2 = \\lambda w_3 \\implies w_3 = \\frac{0.6}{\\lambda} w_2 = \\frac{0.3}{\\lambda^2} w_1$\nSetting $w_1 = 1$, the right eigenvector is proportional to $\\mathbf{w} \\propto (1, \\frac{0.5}{\\lambda}, \\frac{0.3}{\\lambda^2})^\\top$.\n\nThe unnormalized left eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}$ satisfies $\\mathbf{v}^\\top\\mathbf{A} = \\lambda\\mathbf{v}^\\top$. Let $\\mathbf{v}^\\top = (v_1, v_2, v_3)$.\nFrom the first and third columns of the matrix equation:\n$0.3 v_1 + 0.5 v_2 = \\lambda v_1 \\implies v_2 = \\frac{\\lambda-0.3}{0.5} v_1 = 2(\\lambda-0.3)v_1$\n$0.8 v_1 = \\lambda v_3 \\implies v_3 = \\frac{0.8}{\\lambda} v_1$\nSetting $v_1 = 1$, the left eigenvector is proportional to $\\mathbf{v} \\propto (1, 2(\\lambda-0.3), \\frac{0.8}{\\lambda})^\\top$.\n\nThe sensitivity of a simple eigenvalue $\\lambda$ to a change in a matrix element $a_{ij}$ is given by the derivative $\\frac{\\partial \\lambda}{\\partial a_{ij}}$. To derive this, we start with $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{w} = \\lambda\\mathbf{w}$. Differentiating with respect to $a_{ij}$ gives $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}}{\\partial a_{ij}}\\mathbf{w} + \\mathbf{A}\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{w}}{\\partial a_{ij}} = \\frac{\\partial \\lambda}{\\partial a_{ij}}\\mathbf{w} + \\lambda\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{w}}{\\partial a_{ij}}$. Note that $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}}{\\partial a_{ij}}$ is a matrix with $1$ at position $(i,j)$ and $0$ elsewhere. Left-multiplying by $\\mathbf{v}^\\top$ gives $\\mathbf{v}^\\top\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}}{\\partial a_{ij}}\\mathbf{w} + \\mathbf{v}^\\top\\mathbf{A}\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{w}}{\\partial a_{ij}} = \\frac{\\partial \\lambda}{\\partial a_{ij}}\\mathbf{v}^\\top\\mathbf{w} + \\lambda\\mathbf{v}^\\top\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{w}}{\\partial a_{ij}}$. Since $\\mathbf{v}^\\top\\mathbf{A}=\\lambda\\mathbf{v}^\\top$, this simplifies to $v_i w_j = \\frac{\\partial \\lambda}{\\partial a_{ij}}\\mathbf{v}^\\top\\mathbf{w}$. Thus, the sensitivity is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\lambda}{\\partial a_{ij}} = \\frac{v_i w_j}{\\mathbf{v}^\\top \\mathbf{w}} $$\nThe elasticity is the proportional sensitivity, a dimensionless measure defined as $e_{ij} = \\frac{a_{ij}}{\\lambda}\\frac{\\partial \\lambda}{\\partial a_{ij}}$.\nConceptually, sensitivity measures the absolute change in $\\lambda$ for a unit absolute change in a vital rate $a_{ij}$ and is therefore dependent on the units and scale of $a_{ij}$. Elasticity measures the percentage change in $\\lambda$ for a one percent change in $a_{ij}$, providing a scale-independent measure of relative importance.\n\nFinally, we compute the elasticity of $\\lambda$ with respect to the juvenile survival probability $S_1 = a_{21}=0.5$. The formula is:\n$$ e_{21} = \\frac{a_{21}}{\\lambda} \\frac{\\partial \\lambda}{\\partial a_{21}} = \\frac{a_{21}}{\\lambda} \\frac{v_2 w_1}{\\mathbf{v}^\\top \\mathbf{w}} $$\nWe have chosen unnormalized eigenvectors where $w_1=1$ and $v_2 = 2(\\lambda-0.3)$.

For each week, she conducts a two-sample $t$-test comparing the $30$ cobble measurements from the treated reach with the $30$ cobble measurements from the control reach, using $n=30$ per treatment per week, and interprets a statistically significant difference as evidence that shade removal increases periphyton biomass.\n\nUsing the core definitions of experimental design and statistical inference in ecology, in particular: (i) the experimental unit is the smallest unit to which a treatment is independently applied and randomized; (ii) valid frequentist tests for treatment effects require independent and identically distributed sampling errors across experimental units; and (iii) subsamples within an experimental unit can improve precision but do not increase the number of independent replicates, diagnose whether the current design suffers from pseudoreplication and select all options that propose a redesign that satisfies independence and replication while preserving logistical feasibility for a field ecologist (e.g., by relying on moderate numbers of whole-stream replicates and within-unit subsampling rather than vastly increasing total effort).\n\nWhich of the following statements are correct?\n\nA.

Before a solution can be derived, the experimental design itself must be validated against the provided principles of experimental design and statistical inference.\n\nThe core principles provided are:\n(i) The experimental unit is the smallest unit to which a treatment is independently applied and randomized.\n(ii) Valid frequentist tests require independent and identically distributed sampling errors across experimental units.\n(iii) Subsamples within an experimental unit do not increase the number of independent replicates.\n\nFirst, let us diagnose the proposed experimental design. The treatment is the removal of riparian shade. This treatment is applied to a single, contiguous downstream reach of a creek, which is $1\\,\\mathrm{km}$ long. The \"control\" is the adjacent upstream reach, which remains shaded. The assignment of treatment is not randomized; it is fixed by the upstream-downstream configuration, which introduces a systematic confounding factor. Any inherent longitudinal gradient in stream characteristics (e.g., nutrient concentration, stream width, depth, substrate) could be mistaken for a treatment effect.\n\nMore critically, let us identify the experimental unit. Following definition (i), the treatment of \"shade removal\" is applied to the entire $1\\,\\mathrm{km}$ reach. Therefore, the stream *reach* is the experimental unit. The design consists of one treated experimental unit and one control experimental unit. The statistical replication for the treatment effect is thus $n=1$ for each group.\n\nThe ecologist, however, performs a two-sample $t$-test using the $30$ cobbles from each reach, treating them as if $n=30$ independent replicates. This violates principle (ii). The cobbles within a single reach are not independent replicates of the treatment. They are subsamples taken from a single experimental unit, as correctly stated in principle (iii). Any unique characteristic of the treated reach (e.g., a localized nutrient seep, a particular flow regime) is shared by all $30$ cobbles within it. The variance among these cobbles measures only the within-reach variability (sampling error), not the variability between truly replicated treated reaches. Inferring a treatment effect from a comparison of two non-replicated units based on their internal variability is a classic error known as **pseudoreplication**. The design is fundamentally flawed because it lacks true replication of the experimental units.\n\nThe problem statement itself is a valid description of a common scenario and a well-defined conceptual question in ecology.

The experimental unit is the cobble, so the design has $n=30$ true replicates per treatment per week. Independence holds if cobbles are at least $1\\,\\mathrm{m}$ apart; therefore, no redesign is necessary.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. It misidentifies the experimental unit. The treatment (shade removal) is applied to the stream reach, not to individual cobbles. According to definition (i), the cobble cannot be the experimental unit because the treatment was not independently applied to each cobble. The $30$ cobbles are subsamples. Declaring them to be $n=30$ true replicates is the very definition of pseudoreplication, which the problem asks us to diagnose. The spatial separation of $1\\,\\mathrm{m}$ might reduce spatial autocorrelation among subsamples, which is good practice for obtaining representative samples of the reach, but it does not and cannot transform subsamples into true replicates of the whole-stream treatment.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The experimental unit is the stream reach (or stream), so the design has $n=1$ per treatment. Treating cobbles as replicates is pseudoreplication because subsamples within a reach share reach-level conditions. A feasible redesign is to select $m \\ge 4$ independent streams, randomly assign $m/2$ to shade removal and $m/2$ to control, sample multiple cobbles within each stream as subsamples, and analyze effects at the stream level (e.g., by comparing stream means or using a mixed-effects model with stream as a random effect).**\n\nThis statement begins with a correct diagnosis of the flaw in the original design: the experimental unit is the reach, the replication is $n=1$, and using cobbles as replicates is pseudoreplication. The proposed redesign directly addresses this flaw. It calls for selecting multiple, independent streams ($m \\ge 4$), which serve as the true experimental units. It mandates the random assignment of treatments to these units, which is crucial for making valid causal inferences. It correctly identifies the role of cobble-level measurements as subsamples used to characterize each experimental unit precisely. Finally, it specifies a correct analytical approach: the statistical comparison must be performed at the level of the experimental unit (the stream), for example by comparing the mean response of the control streams to the mean response of the treated streams. This is a standard, robust, and logistically feasible design for this type of ecological question.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Temporal replication can substitute for spatial replication: treat the $8$ weeks as $n=8$ independent replicates per treatment by averaging cobbles within a reach each week and comparing the weekly reach means between treatments. Multiple streams are unnecessary if weeks are independent.**\n\nThis proposal illicitly attempts to substitute temporal measurements for spatial replication. The sequence of $8$ weekly measurements on the same stream reach represents repeated measures, not independent replicates of the treatment effect. The state of the stream in week $t+1$ is highly likely to be dependent on its state in week $t$. The treatment was applied only once at the beginning of the experiment, not independently in each of the $8$ weeks. Therefore, the assumption of independence required for a standard test treating weeks as replicates is violated. This is a form of temporal pseudoreplication. While time series analysis could be used to characterize the dynamics of the two reaches, it cannot substitute for the lack of true replication of the treatment application.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Implement a Before–After–Control–Impact (BACI) design with $k \\ge 2$ impact streams and $k \\ge 2$ control streams. Sample multiple cobbles per stream for several weeks before and after shade removal, and test the treatment-by-time interaction at the stream level. This yields independent replication at the stream level while leveraging time to improve precision, with feasible effort via subsampling.**\n\nThis option proposes a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design. This is a highly robust and widely recommended design for environmental impact assessment. It correctly identifies the need for multiple, independent experimental units for both the control ($k \\ge 2$) and impact ($k \\ge 2$) groups, thereby providing true replication. By collecting data both *before* and *after* the treatment is applied, the design allows the researcher to control for pre-existing differences among the streams. The key statistical test for a treatment effect in a BACI design is the significance of the interaction between the group factor (Control vs. Impact) and the time factor (Before vs. After). A significant interaction indicates that the difference between the two groups of streams has changed following the impact, providing strong evidence for a causal effect. This design utilizes subsampling (multiple cobbles) correctly to improve the precision of the estimate for each stream at each time point. This design is logistically feasible and represents a powerful improvement over the original flawed study.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. To increase independence without adding streams, place grazer-exclusion cages on half the cobbles in the treated reach and use uncaged cobbles as controls; compare caged versus uncaged cobbles within the treated reach to more precisely isolate the effect of shade removal without redesigning the whole-stream allocation.**\n\nThis proposal fundamentally misunderstands the problem. It does not address the lack of replication for the *shade removal* treatment. Instead, it introduces a new, entirely different experiment *within* the single treated reach. This new experiment tests the effect of *grazer exclusion* under unshaded conditions. The \"control\" in this new design (uncaged cobbles) is not a control for shade removal; all cobbles, caged and uncaged, are still within the single, unreplicated unshaded reach. This design does nothing to solve the pseudoreplication problem of the original shade removal study and, in fact, does not even attempt to measure the effect of shade removal.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nIn summary, the original design suffers from pseudoreplication. Options B and D both propose valid and robust redesigns that incorporate true replication at the appropriate spatial scale (the stream), use subsampling appropriately, and are logistically feasible for field ecology.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BD}$$", "id": "2492993"}]}
