It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. It presents a standard exercise in comparing discrete-time and continuous-time population models, which is a fundamental concept in quantitative ecology. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires establishing a formal equivalence between a discrete-time geometric growth model and a continuous-time exponential growth model. The core principle for relating these models is that they must predict the identical population fold-change over any given time interval.\n\nLet $N_t$ be the population size at census time $t$, where time is measured in discrete intervals of one month. The geometric growth model is given by:\n$$N_{t+1} = \\lambda N_t$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the finite rate of increase over one census interval, given as $\\lambda = 1.10$.\n\nLet $N(t)$ be the population size at any continuous time $t$. The exponential growth model is described by the differential equation:\n$$\\frac{dN}{dt} = r N$$\nThe solution to this equation is $N(t) = N(0) \\exp(r t)$, where $N(0)$ is the initial population size at $t=0$ and $r$ is the intrinsic rate of increase. The units of $r$ must match the units of time $t$.\n\nThe requirement is that the fold-change, $\\frac{N(\\Delta t)}{N(0)}$, is identical for both models over a time interval $\\Delta t$. We will use this principle for the derivations.\n\n1. Derivation of the intrinsic rate per month, $r_{\\text{mo}}$.\nLet the time interval be one month, so $\\Delta t = 1$ month.\nFor the geometric model, the population size after one month is $N_1 = \\lambda N_0$. The fold-change is $\\frac{N_1}{N_0} = \\lambda$.\nFor the exponential model, we use the intrinsic rate per month, $r_{\\text{mo}}$, and measure time $t$ in months. After $t=1$ month, the population is $N(1) = N(0) \\exp(r_{\\text{mo}} \\cdot 1)$. The fold-change is $\\frac{N(1)}{N(0)} = \\exp(r_{\\text{mo}})$.\nEquating the fold-changes from both models:\n$$\\lambda = \\exp(r_{\\text{mo}})$$\nTo find $r_{\\text{mo}}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$r_{\\text{mo}} = \\ln(\\lambda)$$\nUsing the given value $\\lambda = 1.10$:\n$$r_{\\text{mo}} = \\ln(1.10) \\approx 0.0953101798 \\text{ month}^{-1}$$\nRounded to six significant figures, $r_{\\text{mo}} = 0.0953102 \\text{ month}^{-1}$.\n\n2. Derivation of the intrinsic rate per year, $r_{\\text{yr}}$.\nThe intrinsic rate $r$ is an instantaneous rate. If the rate is constant, the rate over a longer time period is the rate per unit time multiplied by the number of time units. Since there are $12$ months in one year, the intrinsic rate per year, $r_{\\text{yr}}$, is related to the monthly rate $r_{\\text{mo}}$ by:\n$$r_{\\text{yr}} = 12 \\cdot r_{\\text{mo}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $r_{\\text{mo}}$:\n$$r_{\\text{yr}} = 12 \\ln(\\lambda)$$\nAlternatively, we can consider the fold-change over one year ($\\Delta t = 1$ year $= 12$ months).\nIn the geometric model, applying the monthly multiplier $12$ times gives a population size of $N_{12} = \\lambda^{12} N_0$. The yearly fold-change is $\\lambda^{12}$.\nIn the exponential model, with time $t$ in years and rate $r_{\\text{yr}}$, the population after $t=1$ year is $N(1) = N(0) \\exp(r_{\\text{yr}} \\cdot 1)$. The fold-change is $\\exp(r_{\\text{yr}})$.\nEquating these yearly fold-changes:\n$$\\lambda^{12} = \\exp(r_{\\text{yr}})$$\nTaking the natural logarithm confirms the previous result:\n$$r_{\\text{yr}} = \\ln(\\lambda^{12}) = 12 \\ln(\\lambda)$$\nUsing the value of $r_{\\text{mo}}$ we computed:\n$$r_{\\text{yr}} = 12 \\cdot \\ln(1.10) \\approx 12 \\cdot 0.0953101798 \\approx 1.143722157 \\text{ year}^{-1}$$\nRounded to six significant figures, $r_{\\text{yr}} = 1.14372 \\text{ year}^{-1}$.\n\n3. Conversion back from $r_{\\text{mo}}$ to the monthly multiplier, $\\lambda_{\\text{from }r_{\\text{mo}}}$.\nThis is a consistency check. The relationship derived in Part 1 is $\\lambda = \\exp(r_{\\text{mo}})$. The problem asks for the discrete-time multiplier over one month derived from $r_{\\text{mo}}$. Let us call this $\\lambda_{\\text{from }r_{\\text{mo}}}$. By definition, it is the fold-change over one month predicted by the continuous model:\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{from }r_{\\text{mo}}} = \\frac{N(1 \\text{ month})}{N(0)} = \\exp(r_{\\text{mo}} \\cdot 1) = \\exp(r_{\\text{mo}})$$\nSubstituting $r_{\\text{mo}} = \\ln(\\lambda)$:\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{from }r_{\\text{mo}}} = \\exp(\\ln(\\lambda)) = \\lambda$$\nAs expected, this is an identity. Numerically:\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{from }r_{\\text{mo}}} = \\lambda = 1.10$$\nTo six significant figures, this is $1.10000$.\n\n4. Conversion back from $r_{\\text{yr}}$ to the yearly multiplier, $\\Lambda_{\\text{yr from }r_{\\text{yr}}}$.\nThe discrete-time multiplier over one year, which we denote $\\Lambda_{\\text{yr}}$, is the fold-change over one year. Using the continuous model with the yearly rate $r_{\\text{yr}}$, this is:\n$$\\Lambda_{\\text{yr from }r_{\\text{yr}}} = \\frac{N(1 \\text{ year})}{N(0)} = \\exp(r_{\\text{yr}} \\cdot 1) = \\exp(r_{\\text{yr}})$$\nSubstituting the expression for $r_{\\text{yr}} = 12 \\ln(\\lambda)$:\n$$\\Lambda_{\\text{yr from }r_{\\text{yr}}} = \\exp(12 \\ln(\\lambda)) = \\exp(\\ln(\\lambda^{12})) = \\lambda^{12}$$\nInterpretation: The yearly discrete multiplier, $\\Lambda_{\\text{yr}}$, is the monthly discrete multiplier, $\\lambda$, compounded over $12$ monthly periods. This aligns perfectly with the logic of the geometric model.\nNumerically:\n$$\\Lambda_{\\text{yr from }r_{\\text{yr}}} = (1.10)^{12} \\approx 3.138428377$$\nRounded to six significant figures, $\\Lambda_{\\text{yr from }r_{\\text{yr}}} = 3.13843$.\n\nFinal computation summary, with all values rounded to six significant figures:\n- $r_{\\text{mo}} = \\ln(1.10) \\approx 0.0953102$\n- $r_{\\text{yr}} = 12 \\ln(1.10) \\approx 1.14372$\n- $\\lambda_{\\text{from }r_{\\text{mo}}} = 1.10000$\n- $\\Lambda_{\\text{yr from }r_{\\text{yr}}} = (1.10)^{12} \\approx 3.13843$\n\nThe results are to be reported in the specified order.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.0953102 & 1.14372 & 1.10000 & 3.13843 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2523511"}, {"introduction": "Exponential growth is a useful but ultimately unrealistic idealization, as resource limits inevitably constrain populations.

The parameters provided are realistic for an ecological system. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution is now developed in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the differential equation.\n\nWe are given that the per-capita growth rate $r(N)$ is a linear function of population density $N$. We can express this relationship as:\n$$r(N) = aN + b$$\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are constants to be determined.\n\nWe use the two provided boundary conditions to solve for these constants.\nFirst, at zero density ($N=0$), the per-capita growth rate is the intrinsic maximum, $r(0) = r_{\\max}$. Substituting this into our linear equation:\n$$r(0) = a(0) + b = r_{\\max}$$\nThis immediately gives $b = r_{\\max}$.\n\nSecond, at the carrying capacity ($N=K$), the population growth ceases, which means the per-capita growth rate is zero, $r(K) = 0$. Substituting this and our value for $b$ into the linear equation:\n$$r(K) = aK + r_{\\max} = 0$$\nSolving for the constant $a$:\n$$aK = -r_{\\max}$$\n$$a = -\\frac{r_{\\max}}{K}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $a$ and $b$ back into the equation for $r(N)$:\n$$r(N) = \\left(-\\frac{r_{\\max}}{K}\\right)N + r_{\\max}$$\nFactoring out $r_{\\max}$ yields the standard form for the per-capita growth rate under logistic dynamics:\n$$r(N) = r_{\\max}\\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right)$$\n\nThe problem defines the overall population growth rate as $\\frac{dN}{dt} = r(N)N$. Substituting our derived expression for $r(N)$ into this general differential equation gives the specific differential equation for this system:\n$$\\frac{dN}{dt} = r_{\\max} N \\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right)$$\nThis is the logistic growth equation, which governs the dynamics of $N(t)$ under the stated assumptions.\n\nPart 2: Computation of the instantaneous growth rate at specified abundances.\n\nWe are given the parameter values $r_{\\max} = 0.5\\,\\text{yr}^{-1}$ and $K = 1000$ individuals.

This requires computing the first derivative of $f(N)$ with respect to $N$.\nThe function is $f(N) = N + rN - \\frac{r}{K}N^2$. Its derivative is:\n$$f'(N) = \\frac{d}{dN} \\left( N + rN - \\frac{r}{K}N^2 \\right) = 1 + r - \\frac{2rN}{K}$$\nThe local stability of the equilibrium $N^* = K$ is determined by the value of this derivative evaluated at $N = K$.

This is determined by the sign of the eigenvalue $f'(K)$.\n- If $0 < f'(K) < 1$, perturbations decay monotonically.\n- If $-1 < f'(K) < 0$, perturbations decay via damped oscillations.\nIn our case, $f'(K) = -0.5$, which satisfies $-1 < f'(K) < 0$.
