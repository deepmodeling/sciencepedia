Discrete-time models of density dependence, such as the Ricker and Beverton–Holt models, provide foundational frameworks for exploring these dynamics.

We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires a comparison of the local dynamics of two discrete-time population models, the Ricker model and the Beverton-Holt model, at their respective positive equilibria, which are made to coincide at the carrying capacity $K$. The comparison is to be quantified by the ratio of the absolute values of their local multipliers.\n\nFirst, we analyze the Ricker model. The population map is given by\n$$f_R(N_t) = N_t \\exp\\left(r\\left(1 - \\frac{N_t}{K}\\right)\\right)$$\nwhere $N_t$ is the population size at time $t$, $r > 0$ is the intrinsic rate of increase, and $K > 0$ is the carrying capacity.\nThe equilibria $N^{\\ast}$ are found by solving the equation $N^{\\ast} = f_R(N^{\\ast})$:\n$$N^{\\ast} = N^{\\ast} \\exp\\left(r\\left(1 - \\frac{N^{\\ast}}{K}\\right)\\right)$$\nThis equation has two solutions. The first is the trivial equilibrium, $N_0^{\\ast} = 0$. For the second, assuming $N^{\\ast} \\neq 0$, we divide by $N^{\\ast}$ to get:\n$$1 = \\exp\\left(r\\left(1 - \\frac{N^{\\ast}}{K}\\right)\\right)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides yields $\\ln(1) = 0$, so:\n$$r\\left(1 - \\frac{N^{\\ast}}{K}\\right) = 0$$\nSince $r > 0$, this implies $1 - \\frac{N^{\\ast}}{K} = 0$, which gives the positive equilibrium $N_1^{\\ast} = K$.\n\nThe local stability of an equilibrium $N^{\\ast}$ is determined by the magnitude of the derivative of the map, $f_R'(N^{\\ast})$, known as the local multiplier. We compute the derivative of $f_R(N_t)$ with respect to $N_t$ using the product rule:\n$$f_R'(N_t) = \\frac{d}{dN_t}\\left[N_t \\exp\\left(r\\left(1 - \\frac{N_t}{K}\\right)\\right)\\right] = \\exp\\left(r\\left(1 - \\frac{N_t}{K}\\right)\\right) + N_t \\exp\\left(r\\left(1 - \\frac{N_t}{K}\\right)\\right) \\left(-\\frac{r}{K}\\right)$$\n$$f_R'(N_t) = \\exp\\left(r\\left(1 - \\frac{N_t}{K}\\right)\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{r N_t}{K}\\right)$$\nEvaluating this derivative at the positive equilibrium $N^{\\ast} = K$:\n$$\\lambda_R = f_R'(K) = \\exp\\left(r\\left(1 - \\frac{K}{K}\\right)\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{r K}{K}\\right) = \\exp(0) (1 - r) = 1 - r$$\nThe local stability condition for this equilibrium is $|\\lambda_R| = |1 - r| < 1$, which corresponds to $0 < r < 2$.\n\nNext, we analyze the Beverton-Holt model. The map is\n$$f_{BH}(N_t) = \\frac{R N_t}{1 + \\alpha N_t}$$\nwith net reproductive number $R > 0$ and crowding parameter $\\alpha > 0$.\nThe equilibria are found by solving $N^{\\ast} = f_{BH}(N^{\\ast})$:\n$$N^{\\ast} = \\frac{R N^{\\ast}}{1 + \\alpha N^{\\ast}}$$\nThis also has a trivial equilibrium $N_0^{\\ast} = 0$. For $N^{\\ast} \\neq 0$, we have:\n$$1 = \\frac{R}{1 + \\alpha N^{\\ast}} \\implies 1 + \\alpha N^{\\ast} = R \\implies N_1^{\\ast} = \\frac{R-1}{\\alpha}$$\nFor this equilibrium to be positive, we must have $R > 1$, since $\\alpha > 0$.\nThe problem imposes the constraint $\\alpha = (R-1)/K$. This requires $R \\neq 1$. Since $\\alpha > 0$ and $K>0$, it must be that $R-1 > 0$, so $R > 1$. With this constraint, the positive equilibrium becomes:\n$$N_1^{\\ast} = \\frac{R-1}{(R-1)/K} = K$$\nThis correctly sets the positive equilibrium of the Beverton-Holt model to $K$, allowing for direct comparison with the Ricker model.\n\nTo find the local multiplier, we compute the derivative of $f_{BH}(N_t)$ using the quotient rule:\n$$f_{BH}'(N_t) = \\frac{d}{dN_t}\\left[\\frac{R N_t}{1 + \\alpha N_t}\\right] = \\frac{R(1 + \\alpha N_t) - R N_t(\\alpha)}{(1 + \\alpha N_t)^2} = \\frac{R}{(1 + \\alpha N_t)^2}$$\nWe evaluate this at the equilibrium $N^{\\ast} = K$:\n$$\\lambda_{BH} = f_{BH}'(K) = \\frac{R}{(1 + \\alpha K)^2}$$\nSubstituting the constraint $\\alpha = (R-1)/K$:\n$$\\lambda_{BH} = \\frac{R}{\\left(1 + \\frac{R-1}{K} K\\right)^2} = \\frac{R}{(1 + R - 1)^2} = \\frac{R}{R^2} = \\frac{1}{R}$$\nThe stability condition is $|\\lambda_{BH}| = |1/R| < 1$. As $R>1$ is required by the problem's setup, this condition is always fulfilled.\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio of the absolute values of the local multipliers at the shared equilibrium $N^{\\ast} = K$.\nThe desired ratio is $\\dfrac{|\\lambda_R|}{|\\lambda_{BH}|}$.\n$$|\\lambda_R| = |1 - r|$$\n$$|\\lambda_{BH}| = \\left|\\frac{1}{R}\\right| = \\frac{1}{R} \\quad (\\text{since } R > 1)$$\nThe ratio is therefore:\n$$\\frac{|\\lambda_R|}{|\\lambda_{BH}|} = \\frac{|1 - r|}{1/R} = R |1 - r|$$\nThe problem does not impose any constraints on $r$ that would allow for the simplification of the absolute value $|1 - r|$.

The problem states that a site can be either occupied or unoccupied. Let us define a binary indicator variable $I$ such that $I=1$ if the site is occupied and $I=0$ if it is unoccupied. The probability of a site being occupied is given as the occupancy, $\\psi$. Therefore, we have $P(I=1) = \\psi$ and $P(I=0) = 1-\\psi$.\n\nThe expected number of individuals per site, $E[N]$, can be determined using the law of total expectation:\n$$ E[N] = E[N|I=1] P(I=1) + E[N|I=0] P(I=0) $$\nFrom the problem statement, if a site is occupied ($I=1$), the number of individuals follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$.

It describes a standard hierarchical model used in ecology, known as an N-mixture model, for estimating abundance from replicate count data subject to imperfect detection. The assumptions provided are standard for this class of models. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe hierarchical model for a single site $i$ is defined by two levels:\n1.  The latent (unobserved) true abundance $N_i$ is a random variable drawn from a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda_i$. The probability mass function (PMF) is:\n    $$P(N_i=n) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda_i} \\lambda_i^n}{n!}, \\quad \\text{for } n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$$\n2.

Due to the assumption of independence across sites, the full likelihood is the product of the likelihoods for each site:\n$$L\\big(\\{y_{ij}\\}\\mid \\{\\lambda_i\\}, \\{p_{ij}\\}\\big) = \\prod_{i=1}^I L_i\\big(\\{y_{ij}\\}_{j=1}^{J_i} \\mid \\lambda_i, \\{p_{ij}\\}_{j=1}^{J_i}\\big)$$\nWe focus on deriving the likelihood $L_i$ for a single site $i$. This is the marginal probability of observing the sequence of counts $\\{y_{ij}\\}_{j=1}^{J_i}$. This probability is obtained by summing the joint probability of the observations and the latent abundance over all possible values of the latent abundance $N_i$.\n\nThe joint probability of the observations and $N_i=n$ is:\n$$P\\big(\\{y_{ij}\\}_{j=1}^{J_i}, N_i=n\\big) = P\\big(\\{y_{ij}\\}_{j=1}^{J_i} \\mid N_i=n\\big) P(N_i=n)$$\nUsing the conditional independence of the counts $y_{ij}$ given $N_i$:\n$$P\\big(\\{y_{ij}\\}_{j=1}^{J_i} \\mid N_i=n\\big) = \\prod_{j=1}^{J_i} P(y_{ij} \\mid N_i=n) = \\prod_{j=1}^{J_i} \\binom{n}{y_{ij}} p_{ij}^{\\,y_{ij}} (1-p_{ij})^{n-y_{ij}}$$\nSubstituting the PMFs, the joint probability is:\n$$P\\big(\\{y_{ij}\\}_{j=1}^{J_i}, N_i=n\\big) = \\left[\\prod_{j=1}^{J_i} \\binom{n}{y_{ij}} p_{ij}^{\\,y_{ij}} (1-p_{ij})^{n-y_{ij}}\\right] \\frac{e^{-\\lambda_i} \\lambda_i^n}{n!}$$\nTo find the marginal probability $P\\big(\\{y_{ij}\\}_{j=1}^{J_i}\\big)$, we sum over all possible values of $n$:\n$$L_i = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} P\\big(\\{y_{ij}\\}_{j=1}^{J_i}, N_i=n\\big)$$\nNote that the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{y_{ij}}$ is zero if $n < y_{ij}$. Therefore, for the product of binomial PMFs to be non-zero, $n$ must be greater than or equal to all observed counts $y_{ij}$. Let $m_i = \\max_{1 \\le j \\le J_i} y_{ij}$. The summation can start from $n=m_i$:\n$$L_i = \\sum_{n=m_i}^{\\infty} \\frac{e^{-\\lambda_i} \\lambda_i^n}{n!} \\prod_{j=1}^{J_i} \\binom{n}{y_{ij}} p_{ij}^{\\,y_{ij}} (1-p_{ij})^{n-y_{ij}}$$\nThe full likelihood is the product over all sites:\n$$L = \\prod_{i=1}^I \\sum_{n=m_i}^{\\infty} \\left[\\frac{e^{-\\lambda_i}\\lambda_i^n}{n!} \\prod_{j=1}^{J_i} \\binom{n}{y_{ij}} p_{ij}^{\\,y_{ij}} (1-p_{ij})^{n-y_{ij}}\\right]$$\nThis expression matches the likelihood provided in option A.\n\nNext, we analyze parameter identifiability using the laws of total expectation and covariance. For a single site $i$, let us find the marginal moments of the counts $y_{ij}$.\n\nThe marginal expectation of $y_{ij}$ is given by the law of total expectation:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[y_{ij}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[y_{ij} \\mid N_i]] = \\mathbb{E}[N_i p_{ij}] = p_{ij} \\mathbb{E}[N_i] = \\lambda_i p_{ij}$$\n\nThe marginal covariance between counts from two different visits, $y_{ij}$ and $y_{ik}$ for $j \\neq k$, is given by the law of total covariance:\n$$\\operatorname{Cov}(y_{ij}, y_{ik}) = \\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Cov}(y_{ij}, y_{ik} \\mid N_i)] + \\operatorname{Cov}(\\mathbb{E}[y_{ij} \\mid N_i], \\mathbb{E}[y_{ik} \\mid N_i])$$\nSince $y_{ij}$ and $y_{ik}$ are conditionally independent given $N_i$, their conditional covariance is zero: $\\operatorname{Cov}(y_{ij}, y_{ik} \\mid N_i) = 0$.\nThe second term is:\n$$\\operatorname{Cov}(\\mathbb{E}[y_{ij} \\mid N_i], \\mathbb{E}[y_{ik} \\mid N_i]) = \\operatorname{Cov}(N_i p_{ij}, N_i p_{ik}) = p_{ij} p_{ik} \\operatorname{Cov}(N_i, N_i) = p_{ij} p_{ik} \\operatorname{Var}(N_i)$$\nSince $N_i \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_i)$, its variance is $\\operatorname{Var}(N_i) = \\lambda_i$. Therefore, for $j \\neq k$:\n$$\\operatorname{Cov}(y_{ij}, y_{ik}) = \\lambda_i p_{ij} p_{ik}$$\n\nNow we assess identifiability under different designs.\n\nCase $J_i = 1$: With a single visit per site, the data for site $i$ consist of a single count $y_{i1}$. The only available moment is the mean, $\\mathbb{E}[y_{i1}] = \\lambda_i p_{i1}$. A well-known result of this hierarchical structure (Poisson-Binomial) is that the marginal distribution of $y_{i1}$ is also Poisson: $y_{i1} \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_i p_{i1})$. The likelihood depends only on the product $\\lambda_i p_{i1}$. Any pair of values $(\\lambda_i', p_{i1}')$ such that $\\lambda_i' p_{i1}' = \\lambda_i p_{i1}$ yields the same likelihood. Thus, $\\lambda_i$ and $p_{i1}$ are not separately identifiable. They are completely confounded.\n\nCase $J_i \\ge 2$: With at least two visits, we have a system of equations from the moments. For example, with $J_i=2$, we have:\n1. $\\mathbb{E}[y_{i1}] = \\lambda_i p_{i1}$\n2. $\\mathbb{E}[y_{i2}] = \\lambda_i p_{i2}$\n3. $\\operatorname{Cov}(y_{i1}, y_{i2}) = \\lambda_i p_{i1} p_{i2}$\nAssuming $\\mathbb{E}[y_{ij}]$ and $\\operatorname{Cov}(y_{i1}, y_{i2})$ can be estimated from the data, we can solve for the parameters. For instance, substitute (1) and (2) into (3):\n$\\operatorname{Cov}(y_{i1}, y_{i2}) = \\frac{(\\lambda_i p_{i1})(\\lambda_i p_{i2})}{\\lambda_i} = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[y_{i1}]\\mathbb{E}[y_{i2}]}{\\lambda_i}$\nThis allows us to solve for $\\lambda_i$:\n$$\\lambda_i = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[y_{i1}]\\mathbb{E}[y_{i2}]}{\\operatorname{Cov}(y_{i1}, y_{i2})}$$\nOnce $\\lambda_i$ is determined, we can find $p_{i1}$ and $p_{i2}$ from equations (1) and (2). The positive covariance induced by the shared latent abundance $N_i$ across replicate visits is the source of information that allows for the separation of abundance ($\\lambda_i$) from detection probability ($\\{p_{ij}\\}$). This establishes theoretical identifiability. However, practical identifiability can still be weak if covariances are small (e.g., small $\\lambda_i$ or $p_{ij}$) or hard to estimate precisely (e.g., small number of sites $I$ or visits $J_i$). The arguments on confounding from shared covariates and potential remedies are also correct and reflect standard practice in ecological modeling.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. The derived likelihood is correct. The identifiability analysis is correct for both cases $J_i=1$ and $J_i \\ge 2$. It correctly identifies the role of covariance in separating parameters and correctly discusses sources of practical confounding and remedies. **Correct**.\n\nB. This option presents an incorrect likelihood, which assumes that all observations $y_{ij}$ are independent Poisson variables. This is false; counts from the same site are not marginally independent, as demonstrated by the non-zero covariance $\\operatorname{Cov}(y_{ij}, y_{ik})=\\lambda_i p_{ij} p_{ik}$. The conclusion that parameters are identifiable even with $J_i=1$ is a direct consequence of this error and is incorrect. **Incorrect**.\n\nC. This option presents an incorrect likelihood by wrongly assuming that the sum of counts $\\sum_j y_{ij}$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda_i \\sum_j p_{ij}$. This is not the correct marginal distribution for the sum of counts from this process. It ignores the structure of repeated sampling of the same population $N_i$. Its conclusion about identifiability is also flawed. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. This option proposes a likelihood based on a Multinomial observation model, which is an incorrect representation of the data generating process. The process is a series of independent Binomial trials for each visit, not a single Multinomial trial that partitions $N_i$ individuals among visits. The formula provided is also a malformed Multinomial expression. The claim that this model removes redundancy and solves confounding is based on this false premise. In fact, the \"redundancy\" in the form of correlation between replicate counts is what allows for identifiability. **Incorrect**.\n\nThus, option A provides the only correct likelihood and a complete, valid assessment of parameter identifiability and confounding.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2523834"}]}
