Given the parameters $c = 0.6$ and $e = 0.2$, this condition is satisfied.\n\nNext, we assess the local stability of the nontrivial equilibrium $p^{\\ast}$. The stability is determined by the sign of the derivative of the rate function, $f'(p) = \\frac{df}{dp}$, evaluated at the equilibrium point. A negative sign indicates stability, while a positive sign indicates instability.\nThe rate function is $f(p) = (c-e)p - cp^2$.\nIts derivative is:\n$$\nf'(p) = \\frac{d}{dp} \\left[ (c-e)p - cp^2 \\right] = c - e - 2cp\n$$\nEvaluating this derivative at the nontrivial equilibrium $p^{\\ast} = 1 - \\frac{e}{c}$:\n$$\nf'(p^{\\ast}) = c - e - 2c \\left(1 - \\frac{e}{c}\\right) = c - e - 2(c - e) = -(c - e)\n$$\nSince $c > e$, the term $c-e$ is positive, and thus $f'(p^{\\ast}) = -(c - e)$ is negative.

The linearized equation for the perturbation is thus:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\delta}{dt} \\approx f'(p^{\\ast}) \\delta(t)\n$$\nThe solution to this linear equation is $\\delta(t) \\approx \\delta(0) \\exp(f'(p^{\\ast}) t)$.

The core of the problem is to construct a specific matrix, the landscape interaction matrix $M$, and then analyze its spectral properties to assess metapopulation persistence.\n\n1.  **Landscape and Patch Data Representation**: The landscape consists of $N=4$ patches. We first encode the given patch properties into appropriate data structures. The patch areas are stored in a vector $A = [A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4]$, and their centroid coordinates are stored in a matrix of size $N \\times 2$.\n    $$\n    A = [10, 25, 15, 6] \\quad (\\text{in ha})\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\text{Coordinates} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 3 & 4 \\\\ 8 & 1 \\\\ 12 & 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\quad (\\text{in km})\n    $$\n\n2.  **Distance Matrix Calculation**: The spatial configuration of the landscape is captured by the matrix of pairwise Euclidean distances, $D$, where an element $D_{ij} = d_{ij}$ is the distance between patch $i$ and patch $j$.\n    $$\n    d_{ij} = \\sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2}\n    $$\n    This yields a symmetric $4 \\times 4$ matrix with zeros on the diagonal.\n\n3.  **Interaction Matrix ($M$) Construction**: For each test case, characterized by a specific dispersal parameter $\\alpha$, the landscape interaction matrix $M$ is constructed.\n    - The off-diagonal elements $M_{ij}$ for $i \\neq j$ are given by the formula:\n      $$\n      M_{ij} = \\sqrt{A_i A_j} \\exp(-\\alpha d_{ij})\n      $$\n      This formula combines the influence of patch sizes (through their geometric mean, $\\sqrt{A_i A_j}$) and the declining probability of dispersal with distance (through the exponential kernel, $\\exp(-\\alpha d_{ij})$).\n    - The diagonal elements $M_{ii}$ are zero by convention, signifying that a patch's contribution to colonization pressure is only through its interaction with other patches.\n    - The resulting matrix $M$ is real, symmetric, and has non-negative entries.\n\n4.  **Metapopulation Capacity ($\\lambda_M$) Computation**: The metapopulation capacity, $\\lambda_M$, is a crucial synthetic measure of the landscape's ability to support a persistent metapopulation. It is defined as the leading eigenvalue (spectral radius) of the matrix $M$. For a real, symmetric, non-negative matrix such as $M$, the Perron-Frobenius theorem guarantees that its spectral radius is a real, non-negative eigenvalue. This value can be found numerically by computing all eigenvalues of $M$ and selecting the maximum one. We utilize a numerical routine optimized for symmetric matrices to find the eigenvalues.\n    $$\n    \\lambda_M = \\max(\\text{eigenvalues}(M))\n    $$\n    The units of $\\lambda_M$ are hectares ($\\mathrm{ha}$), consistent with the units of the entries of $M$.\n\n5.  **Persistence Criterion Evaluation**: Finally, for each test case's parameters $(\\alpha, c, e)$, we evaluate the persistence criterion:\n    $$\n    c \\lambda_M > e\n    $$\n    Here, $c$ is the colonization coefficient ($\\mathrm{y}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{ha}^{-1}$), and $e$ is the extinction rate ($\\mathrm{y}^{-1}$). The product $c \\lambda_M$ represents the effective colonization rate of the metapopulation system, which has units of $\\mathrm{y}^{-1}$. The inequality compares this system-level colonization rate to the local extinction rate. The result of this comparison is a boolean value (`True` for persistence, `False` for extinction).\n\nFor each test case, we compute $\\lambda_M$, round it to six decimal places, and determine the boolean outcome of the persistence criterion. These two values form the result for that case. The entire procedure is systematically applied to all five test cases provided.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the metapopulation persistence problem for a suite of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define fixed patch properties\n    # Patch areas in hectares (ha)\n    patch_areas = np.array([10.0, 25.0, 15.0, 6.0])\n    \n    # Patch coordinates in kilometers (km)\n    patch_coords = np.array([\n        [0.0, 0.0],  # Patch 1\n        [3.0, 4.0],  # Patch 2\n        [8.0, 1.0],  # Patch 3\n        [12.0, 5.0]  # Patch 4\n    ])\n    \n    # Test suite with varying parameters\n    test_cases = [\n        {'alpha': 0.3, 'c': 0.04, 'e': 0.15},  # Case 1\n        {'alpha': 1.2, 'c': 0.04, 'e': 0.15},  # Case 2\n        {'alpha': 0.05, 'c': 0.02, 'e': 0.08}, # Case 3\n        {'alpha': 0.3, 'c': 0.0, 'e': 0.0},    # Case 4\n        {'alpha': 2.5, 'c': 0.05, 'e': 0.0}    # Case 5\n    ]\n\n    # Step 2: Pre-compute distance matrix and area-product matrix\n    num_patches = len(patch_areas)\n    dist_matrix = np.zeros((num_patches, num_patches))\n    for i in range(num_patches):\n        for j in range(i + 1, num_patches):\n            dist = np.linalg.norm(patch_coords[i] - patch_coords[j])\n            dist_matrix[i, j] = dist\n            dist_matrix[j, i] = dist\n\n    sqrt_areas = np.sqrt(patch_areas)\n    area_product_matrix = np.outer(sqrt_areas, sqrt_areas)\n\n    results = []\n\n    # Process each test case\n    for case in test_cases:\n        alpha = case['alpha']\n        c = case['c']\n        e = case['e']\n\n        # Step 3: Construct the landscape interaction matrix M\n        # Compute kernel matrix K(d) = exp(-alpha * d)\n        # Suppress RuntimeWarning for exp(inf) which can occur if alpha*d is very negative,\n        # but here alpha >= 0 and d >= 0, so it's not an issue.\n        with np.errstate(over='ignore'):\n            kernel_matrix = np.exp(-alpha * dist_matrix)\n        \n        # Calculate M\n        M = area_product_matrix * kernel_matrix\n        \n        # Set diagonal to zero\n        np.fill_diagonal(M, 0)\n        \n        # Step 4: Compute metapopulation capacity (lambda_M)\n        # For a real symmetric matrix, eigvalsh is efficient and returns real eigenvalues.\n        eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvalsh(M)\n        lambda_M = np.max(eigenvalues)\n\n        # Step 5: Evaluate persistence criterion\n        persists = c * lambda_M > e\n        \n        # Format and append the result for the current case\n        # Round lambda_M to six decimal places as required.\n        results.append([round(lambda_M, 6), bool(persists)])\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # The string representation of list of lists is requested.\n    # e.g., [[7.789947, True],[...],...]\n    # Using str() on the list of lists achieves this format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2518350"}]}
