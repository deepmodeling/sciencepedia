We\ncan factor out $-1$ from the term in the parenthesis in the expression for $I$:\n$$I = N^{\\ast} \\left( - (s - 1 + f(N^{\\ast})) \\right)$$\nThis directly relates immigration to the local growth rate at equilibrium:\n$$I = - N^{\\ast} r_{\\text{local}}(N^{\\ast})$$\nThis relationship is fundamental. It demonstrates that a constant immigration $I > 0$ can only sustain an equilibrium population $N^{\\ast} > 0$ if the local dynamics generate a deficit, i.e., $r_{\\text{local}}(N^{\\ast}) < 0$. The total deficit in population numbers, $-r_{\\text{local}}(N^{\\ast}) N^{\\ast}$, must be exactly balanced by the immigration inflow $I$.\n\nSecond, we are tasked with finding the immigration rate $I^{\\ast}$ that results in an equilibrium state $N_{\\beta}^{\\ast}$ where the local per-capita growth rate is precisely $-\\beta$, for some positive constant $\\beta$. We set the condition:\n$$r_{\\text{local}}(N_{\\beta}^{\\ast}) = -\\beta$$\nUsing the definition of $r_{\\text{local}}(N)$, this is:\n$$s - 1 + f(N_{\\beta}^{\\ast}) = -\\beta$$\nSubstituting the functional form for fecundity, $f(N) = \\frac{f_0}{1 + \\alpha N}$:\n$$s - 1 + \\frac{f_0}{1 + \\alpha N_{\\beta}^{\\ast}} = -\\beta$$\nWe must now solve for the equilibrium population size $N_{\\beta}^{\\ast}$ that satisfies this condition.\n$$\\frac{f_0}{1 + \\alpha N_{\\beta}^{\\ast}} = 1 - s - \\beta$$\nIt is a necessary condition that $1 - s - \\beta > 0$ for a positive solution $N_{\\beta}^{\\ast}$ to exist.

The low-density growth rate is therefore:\n$$r_{\\text{local}}(0) = s - 1 + f_0$$\nFor the habitat to not be a true sink, and thus be classifiable as a pseudo-sink or a source, this rate must be positive:\n$$s + f_0 > 1$$\nThis condition ensures that, in the absence of immigration, the population has the intrinsic capacity to grow when rare.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $I^{\\ast}$ using the provided parameters: $f_0 = 1.2$, $\\alpha = 0.001$, $s = 0.65$, and $\\beta = 0.05$.\nFirst, we verify the condition $s + f_0 > 1$:\n$$0.65 + 1.2 = 1.85 > 1$$\nThe condition is satisfied, confirming that the habitat is not a true sink. We now substitute the parameters into the expression for $I^{\\ast}$:\n$$I^{\\ast} = \\frac{0.05}{0.001} \\left( \\frac{1.2 + 0.65 + 0.05 - 1}{1 - 0.65 - 0.05} \\right)$$\n$$I^{\\ast} = 50 \\left( \\frac{1.90 - 1}{0.35 - 0.05} \\right)$$\n$$I^{\\ast} = 50 \\left( \\frac{0.9}{0.3} \\right) = 50 \\times 3$$\n$$I^{\\ast} = 150$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact result is $150$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $150.0$. The units are individuals per year.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{150.0}\n$$", "id": "2534182"}]}
