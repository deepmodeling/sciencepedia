The methods prescribed—finding equilibria and performing linear stability analysis—are standard and fundamental techniques in the study of dynamical systems. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is clearly defined. It asks for a standard analysis of a well-known autonomous ordinary differential equation. The objectives are explicit and lead to a unique, derivable solution.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is precise and quantitative, devoid of any subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides all necessary definitions, equations, and parameter values. There are no contradictions.\n- **Triviality**: While the analysis of the logistic equation is a classical exercise, the problem requires a step-by-step derivation from first principles and a specific interpretation of the results, which constitutes a substantive task in applied mathematics. It is not trivial.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in mathematical biology. We will now proceed with a complete solution.\n\nLet the rate of change of the population be denoted by the function $f(N)$:\n$$\nf(N) = \\frac{dN}{dt} = r\\,N\\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right)\n$$\n\n**Identification of Equilibria**\nEquilibria, or fixed points $N^*$, are values of $N$ for which the population does not change, i.e., $\\frac{dN}{dt} = 0$. We solve the equation $f(N^*) = 0$:\n$$\nr\\,N^*\\left(1 - \\frac{N^*}{K}\\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $r>0$, this equation yields two solutions:\n1. $N^*_1 = 0$. This is the trivial or extinction equilibrium.\n2. $1 - \\frac{N^*_2}{K} = 0 \\implies N^*_2 = K$. This is the non-trivial equilibrium at the carrying capacity.\n\nThe system has two equilibria: $N^* = 0$ and $N^* = K$.\n\n**Linear Stability Analysis**\nTo determine the local stability of each equilibrium, we analyze the behavior of the system under small perturbations. Let $N(t) = N^* + \\epsilon(t)$, where $\\epsilon(t)$ is a small deviation from the equilibrium $N^*$. The dynamics of the perturbation are approximated by linearizing $f(N)$ around $N^*$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\epsilon}{dt} = \\frac{d(N - N^*)}{dt} = \\frac{dN}{dt} = f(N^* + \\epsilon) \\approx f(N^*) + f'(N^*)\\epsilon(t)\n$$\nSince $f(N^*) = 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\epsilon}{dt} \\approx f'(N^*)\\epsilon(t)\n$$\nThe term $f'(N^*)$ is the Jacobian of the one-dimensional system evaluated at the equilibrium, which we denote as the eigenvalue $\\lambda$. The stability of $N^*$ is determined by the sign of $\\lambda = f'(N^*)$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the derivative of $f(N)$:\n$$\nf(N) = rN - \\frac{r}{K}N^2\n$$\n$$\nf'(N) = \\frac{df}{dN} = r - \\frac{2r}{K}N\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this derivative at each equilibrium to find the corresponding eigenvalue.\n\n- For the equilibrium $N^*_1 = 0$:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = f'(0) = r - \\frac{2r}{K}(0) = r\n$$\nSince $r > 0$ by definition, $\\lambda_1 > 0$. An equilibrium with a positive real eigenvalue is **unstable**.\n\n- For the equilibrium $N^*_2 = K$:\n$$\n\\lambda_K = f'(K) = r - \\frac{2r}{K}(K) = r - 2r = -r\n$$\nSince $r > 0$, $\\lambda_K < 0$. An equilibrium with a negative real eigenvalue is **locally asymptotically stable**.\n\n**Interpretation of Eigenvalues**\nThe linearized dynamics of a small perturbation $\\epsilon(t)$ from an equilibrium $N^*$ are given by $\\frac{d\\epsilon}{dt} = \\lambda \\epsilon$, which has the solution $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon(0) \\exp(\\lambda t)$.\n\n- **Sign and Stability**: The sign of $\\lambda$ dictates the qualitative behavior. If $\\lambda > 0$, as for $N^*=0$, the perturbation $\\epsilon(t)$ grows exponentially, meaning the system moves away from the equilibrium. This signifies instability. If $\\lambda < 0$, as for $N^*=K$, the perturbation $\\epsilon(t)$ decays exponentially to zero, meaning the system returns to the equilibrium. This signifies local stability.\n\n- **Magnitude and Resilience**: Resilience can be defined as the rate at which a system returns to equilibrium following a perturbation. For the stable equilibrium $N^*=K$, the perturbation decays as $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon(0)\\exp(-rt)$. The quantity $r = |\\lambda_K|$ is the exponential rate of decay. A larger magnitude of the negative eigenvalue (a larger $r$) implies a faster decay of perturbations and thus a more resilient system. This quantity $|\\lambda_K| = r$ is the characteristic return speed.\n\n- **Characteristic Timescale**: The characteristic return time, $\\tau$, is the time required for the perturbation to decay to $1/e$ of its initial value. This is the $e$-folding time. From $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon(0)\\exp(-|\\lambda|t)$, we set $t=\\tau$ such that $\\epsilon(\\tau) = \\epsilon(0)/e = \\epsilon(0)\\exp(-1)$. This gives $-|\\lambda|\\tau = -1$, which leads to the definition of the characteristic timescale:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{1}{|\\lambda|}\n$$\nFor the stable carrying capacity equilibrium, the eigenvalue is $\\lambda_K=-r$, so the characteristic return time is $\\tau = \\frac{1}{r}$.\n\n**Calculation of Return Time**\nThe problem requires the calculation of the characteristic return time to the carrying capacity equilibrium ($N^*=K$) for the given parameters $r = 0.46\\,\\text{yr}^{-1}$ and $K = 1200$ individuals.\n\nThe eigenvalue at this equilibrium is $\\lambda_K = -r = -0.46\\,\\text{yr}^{-1}$.\nThe characteristic return time $\\tau$ is:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{1}{|\\lambda_K|} = \\frac{1}{|-r|} = \\frac{1}{r}\n$$\nSubstituting the given value of $r$:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{1}{0.46}\\,\\text{yr} \\approx 2.173913... \\,\\text{yr}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we obtain:\n$$\n\\tau \\approx 2.174\\,\\text{yr}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.174}$$", "id": "2475393"}, {"introduction": "While the standard logistic model assumes a linear decline in per-capita growth, nature often presents more complex relationships.

Thus, the carrying capacity equilibrium is $N_2^* = K$.\n\nNext, we assess the local stability of each equilibrium by examining the sign of the derivative of $f(N)$ evaluated at the equilibrium point. The function $f(N)$ can be written as $f(N) = rN - \\frac{r}{K^{\\theta}}N^{\\theta+1}$.

Therefore,\n$$ f'(0) = r $$\nAs $r > 0$, the derivative is positive, which indicates that the equilibrium at $N_1^* = 0$ is locally unstable.

This indicates that the equilibrium at $N_2^* = K$ is locally stable. Any small perturbation away from $K$ will result in the population returning towards $K$.\n\nNow, we proceed to part (b) by analyzing the system's behavior near the stable equilibrium $N^* = K$. Let $x(t) = N(t) - K$ represent a small deviation from the carrying capacity, so that $N(t) = K + x(t)$. The dynamics of this deviation are governed by:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(N(t) - K) = \\frac{dN}{dt} = f(K+x(t)) $$\nFor small $x(t)$, we can use a first-order Taylor series expansion of $f(N)$ around $N=K$:\n$$ f(K+x(t)) \\approx f(K) + f'(K) x(t) $$\nFrom the stability analysis, we have $f(K) = 0$ and $f'(K) = -r\\theta$. Substituting these values, the linearized equation for the perturbation $x(t)$ becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} \\approx -r\\theta x(t) $$\nThis is a linear, homogeneous ordinary differential equation. Its solution is:\n$$ x(t) = x(0) \\exp(-r\\theta t) $$\nThe problem defines the local exponential relaxation rate $\\lambda(\\theta; r, K)$ such that $x(t) \\approx x(0)\\exp(-\\lambda t)$. By comparing this definition with our derived solution, we can directly identify $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda(\\theta; r, K) = r\\theta $$\nThis relaxation rate $\\lambda$ describes how quickly the population returns to the carrying capacity after a perturbation. It is directly proportional to both the intrinsic growth rate $r$ and the shape parameter $\\theta$. A larger $\\theta$ implies stronger density dependence near $K$, causing a faster return to equilibrium. It is notable that the local relaxation rate is independent of the carrying capacity $K$.\n\nFinally, we are required to find the dimensionless normalized convergence factor $c(\\theta)$, which is defined as $c(\\theta) \\equiv \\frac{\\lambda(\\theta; r, K)}{r}$.
