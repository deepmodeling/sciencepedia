Let $l_x$ denote the survivorship function, interpreted as the probability that a newborn survives to exact age $x$, and let $m_x$ denote the per-capita fertility (offspring per individual per year) at exact age $x$. Define $p_x$ as the conditional probability of surviving from age $x$ to age $x+1$, $q_x$ as the conditional probability of dying in the interval $[x,x+1)$ given alive at age $x$, and $e_x$ as the remaining life expectancy at exact age $x$ (expected additional years lived).\n\nUsing only the core definitions of conditional probability and mathematical expectation, derive general expressions that relate $p_x$ and $q_x$ to $l_x$, and express $e_x$ in terms of $l_x$ under the standard life-table assumption that deaths are spread uniformly within each $1$-year interval.\n\nThen, consider a short-lived species with maximum age $5$ years, for which there are no survivors at exact age $5$ (that is, $l_5 = 0$).

Express the final life expectancy in years.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of fundamental life-table parameters and their application to a specific dataset for a short-lived species. The problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for its resolution.\n\nFirst, we derive the general expressions as required.\n\nThe survivorship function, $l_x$, is the probability that a newborn individual survives to attain exact age $x$. The function $l_x$ is, by definition, monotonically non-increasing, with $l_0 = 1$.\n\nThe parameter $p_x$ is the conditional probability that an individual alive at age $x$ will survive to age $x+1$. Using the formal definition of conditional probability, $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$, we let event $B$ be \"survival to age $x$\" and event $A$ be \"survival to age $x+1$\". The probability of event $B$ is $P(B) = l_x$. The event \"survival to age $x+1$\" is a subset of the event \"survival to age $x$\". Thus, the intersection $A \\cap B$ is simply event $A$, and its probability is $P(A) = l_{x+1}$.\nTherefore, the expression for $p_x$ is:\n$$p_x = \\frac{l_{x+1}}{l_x}$$\n\nThe parameter $q_x$ is the conditional probability that an individual alive at age $x$ will die within the age interval $[x, x+1)$. For an individual alive at age $x$, there are only two possible outcomes in the next year: survival to age $x+1$ or death before age $x+1$. These are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events. Thus, their probabilities must sum to $1$.\n$$p_x + q_x = 1$$\nFrom this, we derive the expression for $q_x$ in terms of $p_x$ and subsequently in terms of $l_x$:\n$$q_x = 1 - p_x = 1 - \\frac{l_{x+1}}{l_x} = \\frac{l_x - l_{x+1}}{l_x}$$\nThe numerator, $l_x - l_{x+1}$, represents the probability that a newborn dies in the age interval $[x, x+1)$.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the remaining life expectancy at age $x$, denoted $e_x$. This is the expected number of additional years an individual of age $x$ will live. We are given the standard assumption that deaths are uniformly distributed within any $1$-year age interval.\nLet $L_i$ be the number of person-years lived by the cohort in the age interval $[i, i+1)$. Under the uniform distribution of deaths assumption, $L_i$ is the average of the number of individuals alive at the start and end of the interval, which from a cohort of size $l_0=1$ is $L_i = \\frac{l_i + l_{i+1}}{2}$.\nThe total number of person-years lived by the cohort from age $x$ onwards is $T_x = \\sum_{i=x}^{\\omega-1} L_i$, where $\\omega$ is the maximum age at which no individuals survive (i.e., $l_\\omega=0$).\nThe life expectancy $e_x$ is the average of these future person-years over the $l_x$ individuals who are alive at age $x$.\n$$e_x = \\frac{T_x}{l_x} = \\frac{1}{l_x} \\sum_{i=x}^{\\omega-1} L_i$$\nSubstituting the expression for $L_i$:\n$$e_x = \\frac{1}{l_x} \\sum_{i=x}^{\\omega-1} \\frac{l_i + l_{i+1}}{2}$$\nThis is the required general expression for $e_x$.\n\nNow, we apply these formulae to the specific data provided for the species.\nThe data are: $\\omega=5$, $l_0 = 1.00$, $l_1 = 0.88$, $l_2 = 0.74$, $l_3 = 0.55$, $l_4 = 0.30$, and $l_5 = 0.00$. The fertility schedule is $m_0 = 0$, $m_1 = 0$, $m_2 = 1.30$, $m_3 = 1.10$, $m_4 = 0.20$, and $m_5 = 0$.\n\nWe compute the sequence $\\{p_x\\}$ for $x \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$:\n$p_0 = \\frac{l_1}{l_0} = \\frac{0.88}{1.00} = 0.88$\n$p_1 = \\frac{l_2}{l_1} = \\frac{0.74}{0.88} \\approx 0.8409$\n$p_2 = \\frac{l_3}{l_2} = \\frac{0.55}{0.74} \\approx 0.7432$\n$p_3 = \\frac{l_4}{l_3} = \\frac{0.30}{0.55} \\approx 0.5455$\n$p_4 = \\frac{l_5}{l_4} = \\frac{0.00}{0.30} = 0.00$\n\nWe compute the sequence $\\{q_x\\}$ for $x \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$ using $q_x=1-p_x$:\n$q_0 = 1 - 0.88 = 0.12$\n$q_1 = 1 - \\frac{0.74}{0.88} = \\frac{0.14}{0.88} \\approx 0.1591$\n$q_2 = 1 - \\frac{0.55}{0.74} = \\frac{0.19}{0.74} \\approx 0.2568$\n$q_3 = 1 - \\frac{0.30}{0.55} = \\frac{0.25}{0.55} \\approx 0.4545$\n$q_4 = 1 - 0.00 = 1.00$\n\nWe compute the remaining life expectancy at age $1$, $e_1$. With $x=1$ and $\\omega=5$:\n$$e_1 = \\frac{1}{l_1} \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\frac{l_i + l_{i+1}}{2} = \\frac{1}{l_1} \\left( \\frac{l_1+l_2}{2} + \\frac{l_2+l_3}{2} + \\frac{l_3+l_4}{2} + \\frac{l_4+l_5}{2} \\right)$$\nFirst, we calculate the $L_i$ values:\n$L_1 = \\frac{l_1+l_2}{2} = \\frac{0.88+0.74}{2} = 0.81$\n$L_2 = \\frac{l_2+l_3}{2} = \\frac{0.74+0.55}{2} = 0.645$\n$L_3 = \\frac{l_3+l_4}{2} = \\frac{0.55+0.30}{2} = 0.425$\n$L_4 = \\frac{l_4+l_5}{2} = \\frac{0.30+0.00}{2} = 0.15$\nThe total future person-years for the cohort from age $1$ is $T_1 = L_1 + L_2 + L_3 + L_4 = 0.81 + 0.645 + 0.425 + 0.15 = 2.03$.\nNow, we compute $e_1$:\n$$e_1 = \\frac{T_1}{l_1} = \\frac{2.03}{0.88} \\approx 2.306818...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $e_1 = 2.307$ years.\n\nFinally, we interpret the results. To understand the population's age structure, we must evaluate its growth potential. The net reproductive rate, $R_0$, is the average number of offspring produced by an individual over its lifetime, given by $R_0 = \\sum_{x=0}^{\\omega-1} l_x m_x$.\n$R_0 = l_0 m_0 + l_1 m_1 + l_2 m_2 + l_3 m_3 + l_4 m_4$\n$R_0 = (1.00)(0) + (0.88)(0) + (0.74)(1.30) + (0.55)(1.10) + (0.30)(0.20)$\n$R_0 = 0 + 0 + 0.962 + 0.605 + 0.06 = 1.627$\nSince $R_0 = 1.627 > 1$, the population is growing. A growing population, in the absence of significant immigration or emigration, will exhibit a bottom-heavy age pyramid. This structure is characterized by a high proportion of individuals in the youngest age classes, with numbers dwindling in successive older age classes due to mortality (as shown by the increasing $q_x$ values). The reproduction is concentrated at ages $2$ and $3$, and survivorship to these ages is substantial ($l_2=0.74$), which fuels the population growth and maintains a large base of young individuals. The combination of high fecundity in early-middle age and a relatively short lifespan ($e_0 = 2.97$ years) is typical for a species with rapid population turnover and an expansive age structure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.307}$$", "id": "2468956"}, {"introduction": "Matrix population models are powerful tools for moving beyond description to prediction and management.

Let $\\mathbf{n}(t)$ denote the vector of expected abundances in each age class at time $t \\in \\{0,1,2,\\dots\\}$. The one-step projection is given by\n$$\n\\mathbf{n}(t+1) = \\mathbf{L}\\,\\mathbf{n}(t),\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{L}$ is an $A \\times A$ nonnegative matrix with fertilities in its top row and survivals on the subdiagonal. Specifically, writing $\\mathbf{m} = (m_0,\\dots,m_{A-1})$ for fertilities and $\\mathbf{s} = (s_0,\\dots,s_{A-2})$ for survivals, we have\n$$\n\\mathbf{L} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nm_0 & m_1 & \\cdots & m_{A-1} \\\\\ns_0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n0 & s_1 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\cdots & s_{A-2}\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\nBy the Perronâ€“Frobenius theorem for primitive nonnegative matrices, $\\mathbf{L}$ has a positive dominant eigenvalue $\\lambda$ (the long-run multiplicative growth factor) with a corresponding right eigenvector $\\mathbf{v} \\succ \\mathbf{0}$. Normalizing $\\mathbf{v}$ to unit sum yields the stable age distribution $\\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{v}/\\sum_a v_a$.\n\nTo embed individual heterogeneity, we specify a hierarchical model where survival is modeled on the logit scale and fertility on the log scale with additive normal random effects:\n- For survival at age $a \\in \\{0,\\dots,A-2\\}$, the individual-level survival probability for individual $i$ is\n$$\nS_{i,a} = \\operatorname{logit}^{-1}(\\eta_a + b_i), \\quad b_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma_s^2),\n$$\nwhose population-averaged value is\n$$\ns_a^{\\text{hier}} = \\mathbb{E}\\left[S_{i,a}\\right] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\\eta_a + b)}} \\, \\varphi(b;0,\\sigma_s^2)\\, db,\n$$\nwhere $\\varphi(\\cdot;0,\\sigma_s^2)$ denotes a normal density with mean $0$ and variance $\\sigma_s^2$.\n- For fertility at age $a \\in \\{0,\\dots,A-1\\}$, the individual-level expected number of daughters is\n$$\nM_{i,a} = e^{\\phi_a + c_i}, \\quad c_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma_f^2),\n$$\nwhich yields the population-averaged value\n$$\nm_a^{\\text{hier}} = \\mathbb{E}\\left[M_{i,a}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{\\phi_a + c_i}\\right] = e^{\\phi_a}\\,\\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{c_i}\\right] = e^{\\phi_a + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_f^2}.\n$$\nThese two expectations represent the marginal mean survival and marginal mean fertility across individuals, accounting for heterogeneity on the latent scales. By contrast, a naive plug-in that ignores heterogeneity sets $s_a^{\\text{naive}} = \\operatorname{logit}^{-1}(\\eta_a)$ and $m_a^{\\text{naive}} = e^{\\phi_a}$.\n\nFor $s_a^{\\text{hier}} = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\operatorname{logit}^{-1}(\\eta_a + b)\\right]$ with $b \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma_s^2)$, a direct closed form is not available in general. However, it can be computed to high accuracy by Gaussâ€“Hermite quadrature. Recall the Gaussâ€“Hermite rule\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} f(x)\\, dx \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i f(x_i),\n$$\nwhere $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ are the nodes (roots of the physicistsâ€™ Hermite polynomial of order $N$) and $\\{w_i\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ are the corresponding positive weights. For $b \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma_s^2)$, we write $b = \\sigma_s z$ with $z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, and use the change of variables $z = \\sqrt{2}\\,x$, yielding\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[g(b)\\right] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g(\\sigma_s z)\\,\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-z^2/2}\\, dz\n= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g\\!\\left(\\sigma_s \\sqrt{2}\\, x\\right) e^{-x^2}\\, dx\n\\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \\, g\\!\\left(\\sigma_s \\sqrt{2}\\, x_i\\right).\n$$\nSetting $g(u) = \\operatorname{logit}^{-1}(\\eta_a + u)$ gives a numerically stable and accurate approximation for $s_a^{\\text{hier}}$ when $N$ is moderately large (for example, $N=50$).\n\nOnce we have both $\\mathbf{L}_{\\text{naive}}$ and $\\mathbf{L}_{\\text{hier}}$, we require numerical methods to compute their dominant eigenpairs. While a direct eigendecomposition is possible, the power iteration method is particularly suitable for nonnegative matrices and guarantees nonnegativity of iterates:\n- Initialize $\\mathbf{v}^{(0)} \\succ \\mathbf{0}$ with $\\sum_a v_a^{(0)} = 1$.\n- Iterate $\\mathbf{v}^{(k+1)} = \\mathbf{L}\\,\\mathbf{v}^{(k)} / \\sum_a (\\mathbf{L}\\,\\mathbf{v}^{(k)})_a$ until $\\|\\mathbf{v}^{(k+1)} - \\mathbf{v}^{(k)}\\|_1$ is below a small tolerance.\n- At convergence, $\\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{v}^{(k)}$ is the stable age distribution, and the dominant eigenvalue is $\\lambda = \\sum_a (\\mathbf{L}\\,\\mathbf{p})_a$, because $\\sum_a (\\mathbf{L}\\,\\mathbf{p})_a = \\sum_a \\lambda p_a = \\lambda \\sum_a p_a = \\lambda$ for $\\sum_a p_a = 1$.\n\nTo quantify implications for inferred population pyramids, we compare the stable distributions $\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{naive}}$ and $\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{hier}}$ via the total variation distance\n$$\nD_{\\text{TV}} = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\sum_{a=0}^{A-1} \\left| p_{\\text{hier},a} - p_{\\text{naive},a} \\right|,\n$$\nand summarize the youngest segment under the hierarchical model as\n$$\nY_{\\text{hier}} = \\sum_{a=0}^{1} p_{\\text{hier},a}.\n$$\n\nInterpretation based on core convexity results:\n- Fertility heterogeneity on the log scale yields $m_a^{\\text{hier}} = e^{\\phi_a + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_f^2}$, which strictly exceeds $e^{\\phi_a}$ when $\\sigma_f^2 > 0$. Thus, heterogeneity on the log scale inflates marginal fertility via the arithmetic mean of a lognormal distribution, which tends to increase $\\lambda_{\\text{hier}}$ relative to $\\lambda_{\\text{naive}}$ and to shift the stable age distribution toward younger classes (larger $Y_{\\text{hier}}$), other factors equal.\n- Survival heterogeneity on the logit scale interacts with the S-shaped convexity of the logistic function. For ages with baseline $s_a^{\\text{naive}}  \\tfrac{1}{2}$ (i.e., $\\eta_a  0$), the logistic function is locally convex, and Jensenâ€™s inequality implies $s_a^{\\text{hier}} \\ge s_a^{\\text{naive}}$. For ages with baseline $s_a^{\\text{naive}} > \\tfrac{1}{2}$ (i.e., $\\eta_a > 0$), it is locally concave, implying $s_a^{\\text{hier}} \\le s_a^{\\text{naive}}$. Therefore, heterogeneity tends to increase survival in early low-survival ages and decrease it in high-survival ages, with ambiguous net effects on $\\lambda$ and the pyramid shape depending on the balance of ages.\n\nScientific implications for inferred pyramids:\n- When $(\\sigma_s,\\sigma_f) = (0,0)$, the hierarchical and naive constructions coincide, giving $D_{\\text{TV}} = 0$ and identical pyramids.\n- As $\\sigma_f$ increases, $m_a^{\\text{hier}}$ increases multiplicatively for all ages with potential reproduction, thereby typically increasing $\\lambda_{\\text{hier}}$ and shifting mass toward younger ages (larger $Y_{\\text{hier}}$), producing a broader base in the pyramid.\n- As $\\sigma_s$ increases, $s_a^{\\text{hier}}$ increases for early ages with $\\eta_a  0$ and decreases for later ages with $\\eta_a > 0$, tending to refill the youngest classes while thinning some older classes, thus also generally broadening the base relative to the naive model. The net distortion from the naive pyramid is summarized by $D_{\\text{TV}}$ and can be substantial under strong heterogeneity.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy.polynomial.hermite import hermgauss\n\ndef logistic(x):\n    # Stable logistic\n    # For large negative x, use expit form without overflow\n    return 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-x))\n\ndef expected_logistic_with_normal(eta, sigma, gh_n=64):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute E[ logistic(eta + b) ] where b ~ N(0, sigma^2)\n    via Gauss-Hermite quadrature with gh_n nodes.\n    \"\"\"\n    if sigma == 0.0:\n        return logistic(eta)\n    # Nodes and weights for integral with weight e^{-x^2}\n    x, w = hermgauss(gh_n)\n    # Change of variable: z ~ N(0,1), z = sqrt(2)*x; b = sigma*z = sigma*sqrt(2)*x\n    # E[g(b)] = (1/sqrt(pi)) sum w_i g(sigma*sqrt(2)*x_i)\n    arg = eta + sigma * np.sqrt(2.0) * x\n    g = logistic(arg)\n    val = (w @ g) / np.sqrt(np.pi)\n    # Ensure numerical bounds\n    return float(min(max(val, 0.0), 1.0))\n\ndef leslie_matrix(survivals, fertilities):\n    \"\"\"\n    Build an A x A Leslie matrix with given survivals (length A-1)\n    and fertilities (length A).\n    \"\"\"\n    A = len(fertilities)\n    L = np.zeros((A, A), dtype=float)\n    # top row: fertilities\n    L[0, :] = fertilities\n    # subdiagonal: survivals\n    for a in range(A - 1):\n        L[a + 1, a] = survivals[a]\n    return L\n\ndef power_method_stable_dist(L, tol=1e-14, max_iter=100000):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the stable age distribution (right Perron vector) and dominant eigenvalue\n    for a nonnegative matrix L using power iteration, normalizing by sum at each step.\n    Returns (lambda_dom, p), where p sums to 1 and is nonnegative.\n    \"\"\"\n    A = L.shape[0]\n    v = np.ones(A, dtype=float)\n    v /= v.sum()\n    lam = None\n    for _ in range(max_iter):\n        Lv = L @ v\n        s = Lv.sum()\n        if s = 0 or not np.isfinite(s):\n            # Degenerate case should not occur with given inputs\n            s = 1.0\n        v_new = Lv / s\n        diff = np.abs(v_new - v).sum()\n        v = v_new\n        lam = s  # since sum(v)=1, sum(L v)=lambda\n        if diff  tol:\n            break\n    # Ensure nonnegativity, normalize\n    v = np.maximum(v, 0.0)\n    total = v.sum()\n    if total == 0.0:\n        # Fallback: uniform\n        v = np.ones(A) / A\n        lam = (L @ v).sum()\n    else:\n        v /= total\n    return float(lam), v\n\ndef round6(x):\n    return float(np.round(x, 6))\n\ndef compute_case(eta_vec, phi_vec, sigma_s, sigma_f):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute metrics [lambda_naive, lambda_hier, D_TV, Y_hier]\n    for a single test case.\n    eta_vec: length A-1 (survival logits)\n    phi_vec: length A (fertility log-means)\n    \"\"\"\n    A = len(phi_vec)\n    # Naive parameters\n    s_naive = np.array([logistic(eta) for eta in eta_vec], dtype=float)\n    m_naive = np.exp(np.array(phi_vec, dtype=float))\n    # Hierarchical parameters\n    s_hier = np.array([expected_logistic_with_normal(eta, sigma_s) for eta in eta_vec], dtype=float)\n    m_hier = np.exp(np.array(phi_vec, dtype=float) + 0.5 * (sigma_f ** 2))\n    # Build Leslie matrices\n    L_naive = leslie_matrix(s_naive, m_naive)\n    L_hier = leslie_matrix(s_hier, m_hier)\n    # Dominant eigenvalues and stable distributions\n    lam_naive, p_naive = power_method_stable_dist(L_naive)\n    lam_hier, p_hier = power_method_stable_dist(L_hier)\n    # Total variation distance\n    D_TV = 0.5 * np.abs(p_hier - p_naive).sum()\n    # Youngest group proportion (ages 0 and 1) under hierarchical model\n    Y_hier = p_hier[0:2].sum()\n    return [round6(lam_naive), round6(lam_hier), round6(D_TV), round6(Y_hier)]\n\ndef solve():\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    A = 7\n    # Survival logits for ages 0..A-2 (length 6)\n    eta = [-1.2, -0.3, 1.0, 1.3, 1.1, 0.5]\n    # Fertility log-means for ages 0..A-1 (length 7)\n    phi = [-10.0, -5.0, -0.7, -0.3, -0.5, -0.9, -1.5]\n    test_cases = [\n        (eta, phi, 0.0, 0.0),   # Case 1: no heterogeneity\n        (eta, phi, 0.7, 0.5),   # Case 2: moderate heterogeneity\n        (eta, phi, 1.2, 0.9),   # Case 3: strong heterogeneity\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        eta_vec, phi_vec, sigma_s, sigma_f = case\n        res = compute_case(eta_vec, phi_vec, sigma_s, sigma_f)\n        results.append(res)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # Single line, list of lists, comma-separated, numbers rounded to six decimals already.\n    def fmt_list(lst):\n        return \"[\" + \",\".join(f\"{x:.6f}\" for x in lst) + \"]\"\n    print(\"[\" + \",\".join(fmt_list(r) for r in results) + \"]\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```", "id": "2468924"}]}
