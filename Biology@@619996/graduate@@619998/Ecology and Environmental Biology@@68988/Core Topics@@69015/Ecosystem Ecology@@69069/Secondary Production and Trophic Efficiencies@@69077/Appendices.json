The ratio $I / P_{\\mathrm{prey}}$ over the same spatiotemporal domain gives $EE$.\n\n- Estimating $AE$ (assimilation efficiency): $AE = A / I$ requires simultaneous ingestion and egestion measurements. Conduct controlled feeding trials on representative predators with known rations of the focal prey, collecting all feces and regurgitates to quantify egestion. Use energy or element-specific assays (e.g., bomb calorimetry for energy, carbon–nitrogen analysis for elements) to compute $I$ and the unassimilated fraction. Assimilation is $A = I - \\text{egestion}$. In the field, $AE$ can also be inferred by coupling ingestion estimates with direct measurements of egestion and dissolved organic losses using sediment traps and excretion incubations, though laboratory calibrations usually provide more precise $AE$ for given diets and temperatures.\n\n- Estimating $PE$ (production efficiency): $PE = P_{\\mathrm{pred}} / A$ requires predator production and assimilation. Predator production $P_{\\mathrm{pred}}$ is quantified as somatic growth plus reproductive output over the window (growth from repeated size–mass measurements or otolith/mark–recapture increments; reproduction from gonad production or offspring biomass).

The problem is well-posed, objective, and requires logical deduction based on the provided model. It is not trivial or based on any fallacies. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe objective is to compute the production efficiency, $\\mathrm{PE} = P/I_{C}$. The quantity $P$ represents the carbon incorporated into new biomass. This process is constrained by the availability of assimilated nutrients and the strict stoichiometric requirement of the consumer's biomass, which is a molar C:N ratio of $r_{c} = 6$.\n\nFirst, we determine the amounts of assimilated carbon ($A_{C}$) and nitrogen ($A_{N}$) relative to the ingested carbon, $I_{C}$.\nThe amount of assimilated carbon is given by:\n$$A_{C} = AE_{C} \\cdot I_{C} = 0.7 \\cdot I_{C}$$\nThe amount of ingested nitrogen, $I_{N}$, is related to ingested carbon, $I_{C}$, by the diet's C:N ratio, $r_{d}$:\n$$I_{N} = \\frac{I_{C}}{r_{d}} = \\frac{I_{C}}{20}$$\nThe amount of assimilated nitrogen, $A_{N}$, is then:\n$$A_{N} = AE_{N} \\cdot I_{N} = AE_{N} \\cdot \\frac{I_{C}}{r_{d}} = 0.7 \\cdot \\frac{I_{C}}{20}$$\n\nNext, we must identify the limiting nutrient for growth. This is determined by comparing the ratio of available assimilated nutrients to the ratio required for new biomass. The ratio of assimilated carbon to assimilated nitrogen is:\n$$\\frac{A_{C}}{A_{N}} = \\frac{AE_{C} \\cdot I_{C}}{AE_{N} \\cdot (I_{C}/r_{d})}$$\nGiven that $AE_{C} = AE_{N} = 0.7$, these terms cancel:\n$$\\frac{A_{C}}{A_{N}} = \\frac{I_{C}}{I_{C}/r_{d}} = r_{d} = 20$$\nThe consumer's biomass requires a C:N ratio of $r_{c} = 6$. We compare the ratio of available assimilated nutrients ($A_{C}/A_{N} = 20$) with the ratio required for biomass ($r_{c} = 6$).\nSince $A_{C}/A_{N} > r_{c}$ (that is, $20 > 6$), carbon is available in stoichiometric excess relative to nitrogen. Thus, nitrogen is the limiting nutrient for growth.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, growth proceeds by utilizing the entirety of the limiting nutrient.
