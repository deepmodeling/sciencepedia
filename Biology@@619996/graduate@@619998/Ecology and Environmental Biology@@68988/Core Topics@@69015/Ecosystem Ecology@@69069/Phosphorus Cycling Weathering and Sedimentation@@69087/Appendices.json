The problem states that for time $t < 0$, the system was at steady state under a constant external input $L(t) = L_{0}$. At steady state, the concentration does not change, so $\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = 0$. Let the steady-state concentration be $C_{ss,0}$. The ODE becomes:\n$$ 0 + \\frac{Q}{V} C_{ss,0} = \\frac{L_{0} + S}{V} $$\nSolving for $C_{ss,0}$ yields the initial condition for our problem at $t=0$:\n$$ C(0) = C_{ss,0} = \\frac{L_{0} + S}{Q} $$\n\nNext, we solve the ODE for $t \\ge 0$. At $t=0$, the external input is reduced by $50\\%$, so for all $t \\ge 0$, the input is $L(t) = \\frac{1}{2}L_{0}$. The initial value problem to be solved is:\n$$ \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} + \\frac{Q}{V} C(t) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}L_{0} + S}{V}, \\quad C(0) = \\frac{L_{0} + S}{Q} $$\nThe general solution to this ODE is the sum of the homogeneous solution, $C_h(t)$, and a particular solution, $C_p(t)$.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is:\n$$ \\frac{dC_h(t)}{dt} + \\frac{Q}{V} C_h(t) = 0 $$\nThe solution is of the form $C_h(t) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{V} t\\right)$, where $A$ is a constant of integration.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution $C_p(t) = K$. Substituting this into the full ODE, we note that $\\frac{dK}{dt} = 0$:\n$$ 0 + \\frac{Q}{V} K = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}L_{0} + S}{V} $$\nSolving for $K$ gives the new steady-state concentration, which the system will approach as $t \\to \\infty$:\n$$ C_p(t) = K = C_{ss,1} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}L_{0} + S}{Q} = \\frac{L_{0} + 2S}{2Q} $$\n\nThe general solution for $t \\ge 0$ is the sum $C(t) = C_h(t) + C_p(t)$:\n$$ C(t) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{V} t\\right) + \\frac{L_{0} + 2S}{2Q} $$\n\nTo determine the constant $A$, we apply the initial condition $C(0) = \\frac{L_{0} + S}{Q}$:\n$$ C(0) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{V} \\cdot 0\\right) + \\frac{L_{0} + 2S}{2Q} = A + \\frac{L_{0} + 2S}{2Q} $$\nSetting this equal to the initial condition:\n$$ A + \\frac{L_{0} + 2S}{2Q} = \\frac{L_{0} + S}{Q} $$\n$$ A = \\frac{L_{0} + S}{Q} - \\frac{L_{0} + 2S}{2Q} = \\frac{2(L_{0} + S) - (L_{0} + 2S)}{2Q} = \\frac{2L_{0} + 2S - L_{0} - 2S}{2Q} = \\frac{L_{0}}{2Q} $$\n\nSubstituting the value of $A$ back into the general solution gives the final explicit expression for $C(t)$:\n$$ C(t) = \\frac{L_{0}}{2Q} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{V} t\\right) + \\frac{L_{0} + 2S}{2Q} $$\nThis can be combined into a single expression:\n$$ C(t) = \\frac{1}{2Q} \\left( L_{0} + 2S + L_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{V} t\\right) \\right) $$\nThis expression represents the concentration of phosphorus in the lake for all time $t \\ge 0$, starting from the initial pre-intervention steady state and decaying exponentially towards a new, lower steady state determined by the reduced external loading.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2Q} \\left( L_{0} + 2S + L_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{V} t\\right) \\right)}$$", "id": "2520086"}]}
