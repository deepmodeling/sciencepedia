It is a standard, well-posed problem in ecological modeling that is scientifically sound and objective. I will therefore proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe derivation begins by considering the decomposition of one molar unit of substrate carbon.\n\nLet $C_{sub}$ be the amount of carbon in the substrate that is decomposed. We set our basis as $C_{sub} = 1$ mol.\n\nAccording to the problem definition, the carbon that is assimilated into new microbial biomass, $C_{biomass}$, is given by:\n$$C_{biomass} = Y_C \\times C_{sub} = Y_C \\times 1 = Y_C$$\nWith the given value $Y_C = 0.4$, the carbon assimilated into biomass is $0.4$ mol.\n\nNow, we must determine the nitrogen fluxes associated with this carbon transformation. The analysis is based on molar ratios.\n\nThe amount of nitrogen made available from the decomposition of the substrate, $N_{sub}$, is determined by the substrate's C:N ratio, $C\\!:\\!N_s$. For every mole of carbon in the substrate, there are $\\frac{1}{C\\!:\\!N_s}$ moles of nitrogen.\n$$N_{sub} = \\frac{C_{sub}}{C\\!:\\!N_s} = \\frac{1}{C\\!:\\!N_s}$$\n\nThe amount of nitrogen required by the microbial community to build new biomass, $N_{demand}$, is determined by the amount of carbon being assimilated ($C_{biomass}$) and the C:N ratio of the microbial biomass, $C\\!:\\!N_m$.\n$$N_{demand} = \\frac{C_{biomass}}{C\\!:\\!N_m} = \\frac{Y_C}{C\\!:\\!N_m}$$\n\nThe net inorganic nitrogen flux, which we denote as $N_{net}$, is the difference between the nitrogen supplied by the substrate and the nitrogen demanded for microbial growth. A positive value signifies a surplus of nitrogen released to the environment (net mineralization), while a negative value signifies a deficit of nitrogen that must be taken from the environment (net immobilization).\n$$N_{net} = N_{sub} - N_{demand}$$\n\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $N_{sub}$ and $N_{demand}$, we obtain the general formula for the net inorganic nitrogen flux per unit of substrate carbon decomposed:\n$$N_{net} = \\frac{1}{C\\!:\\!N_s} - \\frac{Y_C}{C\\!:\\!N_m}$$\n\nNow, we apply this formula using the specific values provided in the problem: $C\\!:\\!N_s = 20$, $C\\!:\\!N_m = 8$, and $Y_C = 0.4$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the nitrogen supplied by the substrate per mole of substrate C:\n$$N_{sub} = \\frac{1}{20} = 0.05 \\text{ mol N / mol C}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the nitrogen demanded by the microbes to produce new biomass per mole of substrate C:\n$$N_{demand} = \\frac{0.4}{8} = 0.05 \\text{ mol N / mol C}$$\n\nThe net inorganic nitrogen flux is then calculated:\n$$N_{net} = N_{sub} - N_{demand} = 0.05 - 0.05 = 0$$\n\nThe result is exactly $0$.
