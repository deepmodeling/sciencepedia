Consider a single-substrate, single-enzyme catalytic scheme with extracellular enzyme $E$, substrate $S$, and enzyme–substrate complex $ES$ following the sequence $E + S \\rightleftharpoons ES \\rightarrow E + P$, where $P$ denotes product. Assume the following conditions, which are standard for deriving a saturating rate law for initial reaction rates of extracellular enzymes in soils: (i) the law of mass action applies to the elementary steps, (ii) the enzyme–substrate complex $ES$ reaches a quasi-steady state on the timescale of interest, (iii) product feedbacks are negligible during the initial-rate window, and (iv) the total active enzyme concentration is conserved over this window.\n\nFrom these assumptions and the conservation of the total enzyme pool, derive the expression for the initial reaction rate as a function of the substrate concentration $S$, the maximal rate $V_{\\max}$, and the half-saturation constant $K_{m}$.

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe reaction mechanism is given as:\n$$E + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\stackrel{k_2}{\\rightarrow} E + P$$\nHere, $E$ is the free enzyme, $S$ is the substrate, $ES$ is the enzyme-substrate complex, and $P$ is the product. The rate constants for the forward association, reverse dissociation, and catalytic steps are $k_1$, $k_{-1}$, and $k_2$, respectively.\n\nThe initial rate of reaction, $V$, is the rate of product formation. Based on the law of mass action (Assumption i), this rate is proportional to the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex, denoted as $[ES]$:\n$$V = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_2 [ES]$$\nTo express $V$ in terms of the substrate concentration $[S]$, we must first find an expression for $[ES]$. The rate of change of the concentration of the $ES$ complex is given by its formation minus its breakdown:\n$$\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_1 [E][S] - (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES]$$\n\nWe now apply the quasi-steady-state assumption (QSSA) (Assumption ii), which posits that the concentration of the intermediate complex $ES$ remains approximately constant on the timescale of the initial reaction rate measurement, i.e., $\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} \\approx 0$. This yields:\n$$k_1 [E][S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES]$$\n\nNext, we invoke the conservation of total enzyme concentration (Assumption iv). The total concentration of enzyme, $[E]_T$, is the sum of the free enzyme concentration $[E]$ and the complexed enzyme concentration $[ES]$:\n$$[E]_T = [E] + [ES]$$\nFrom this, we can express the free enzyme concentration as:\n$$[E] = [E]_T - [ES]$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $[E]$ into the steady-state equation gives:\n$$k_1 ([E]_T - [ES])[S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES]$$\nOur goal is to solve this equation for $[ES]$. Expanding the left side:\n$$k_1 [E]_T [S] - k_1 [ES][S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES]$$\nRearranging to group terms containing $[ES]$:\n$$k_1 [E]_T [S] = (k_1 [S] + k_{-1} + k_2)[ES]$$\nSolving for $[ES]$:\n$$[ES] = \\frac{k_1 [E]_T [S]}{k_1 [S] + k_{-1} + k_2}$$\nTo simplify, we divide the numerator and the denominator by $k_1$:\n$$[ES] = \\frac{[E]_T [S]}{[S] + \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1}}$$\n\nWe now define two key parameters. The Michaelis constant, $K_m$, is defined as the combination of rate constants:\n$$K_m = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1}$$\n$K_m$ represents the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of its maximum. Substituting this definition into the expression for $[ES]$:\n$$[ES] = \\frac{[E]_T [S]}{K_m + [S]}$$\nThe maximum possible reaction rate, $V_{\\max}$, occurs when the enzyme is fully saturated with substrate (i.e., as $[S] \\rightarrow \\infty$, $[ES] \\rightarrow [E]_T$). Under these conditions, the rate equation $V = k_2 [ES]$ becomes:\n$$V_{\\max} = k_2 [E]_T$$\n\nFinally, substituting the expressions for $[ES]$ and $V_{\\max}$ into the initial rate equation $V = k_2 [ES]$ yields the Michaelis-Menten equation. Note that the problem uses $S$ for substrate concentration, so we will adopt this notation.\n$$V = k_2 \\left( \\frac{[E]_T S}{K_m + S} \\right) = \\frac{(k_2 [E]_T) S}{K_m + S}$$\n$$V = \\frac{V_{\\max} S}{K_m + S}$$\nThis is the required expression for the initial reaction rate. The assumption of negligible product feedback (Assumption iii) ensures that the reverse reaction $E+P \\rightarrow ES$ is not considered, which is standard for this derivation.\n\nNow, we proceed to compute the numerical values for the rate $V$ at the specified substrate concentrations.

This is expressed as a differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dC_{i}(t)}{dt} = I_{i} - O_{i} $$\nThe problem states that the input flux to each pool is a constant fraction $f_{i}$ of the total input flux $I_{total}$. Thus, $I_{i} = f_{i}I_{total}$. The output flux is due to mineralization, which follows first-order kinetics with a rate constant $k_{i}$. Therefore, the output flux is proportional to the current stock in the pool: $O_{i} = k_{i}C_{i}(t)$.\n\nCombining these gives the governing differential equation for each pool $i \\in \\{f, s, p\\}$:\n$$ \\frac{dC_{i}(t)}{dt} = f_{i}I_{total} - k_{i}C_{i}(t) $$\nSince the problem states there are no transfers among pools, the dynamics of each pool are independent of the others.
