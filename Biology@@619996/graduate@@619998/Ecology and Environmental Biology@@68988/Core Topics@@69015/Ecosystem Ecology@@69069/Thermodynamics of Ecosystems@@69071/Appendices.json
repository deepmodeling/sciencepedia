All data are realistic and sufficient for a unique solution. The problem is a valid exercise in biochemical thermodynamics.\n\nWe begin from first principles. The system described involves the coupling of an exergonic (energy-releasing) reaction to an endergonic (energy-requiring) reaction.\n\nThe primary exergonic process is the complete aerobic oxidation of one mole of glucose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$) to carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) and water ($H_2O$):\n$$ C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \\rightarrow 6CO_2 + 6H_2O $$\nThe Gibbs free energy change for this reaction, per mole of glucose, is given as $\\Delta G_{\\text{glc}} \\approx -2870~\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$. The negative sign confirms that the reaction is spontaneous and releases free energy. The amount of free energy made available to perform work by the oxidation of one mole of glucose is therefore $-\\Delta G_{\\text{glc}}$, a positive quantity.\n\nThe endergonic process is the synthesis of Adenosine Triphosphate ($ATP$) from Adenosine Diphosphate ($ADP$) and inorganic phosphate ($Pi$):\n$$ ADP + Pi \\rightarrow ATP + H_2O $$\nThe Gibbs free energy change required for the synthesis of one mole of $ATP$, known as the phosphorylation potential under the specified in situ conditions, is given as $\\Delta G_{\\text{ATP}} \\approx 50~\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$. The positive sign confirms this reaction is non-spontaneous and requires an input of free energy.\n\nIn biological systems, these reactions are coupled. The free energy released by glucose oxidation drives the synthesis of $ATP$. Let $n_{\\text{ATP}}$ be the number of moles of $ATP$ synthesized for every one mole of glucose oxidized. Based on the principle of additivity for state functions like Gibbs free energy, the total free energy change for the coupled process, $\\Delta G_{\\text{total}}$, is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{total}} = \\Delta G_{\\text{glc}} + n_{\\text{ATP}} \\cdot \\Delta G_{\\text{ATP}} $$\nFor the overall process to be spontaneous and proceed at a finite rate, the Second Law of Thermodynamics requires that $\\Delta G_{\\text{total}} < 0$. Some free energy must be dissipated as heat, increasing the entropy of the universe.\n\nThe problem specifies the overall thermodynamic efficiency, $\\eta$, of this energy conversion process. The efficiency of a process performing work is defined as the ratio of useful work output to the total energy input. In this chemical system, the \"useful work output\" is the free energy stored in the chemical bonds of the newly synthesized $ATP$ molecules. For $n_{\\text{ATP}}$ moles of $ATP$, this energy is $n_{\\text{ATP}} \\cdot \\Delta G_{\\text{ATP}}$. The \"total energy input\" is the free energy released by the driving reaction, which is $-\\Delta G_{\\text{glc}}$.\n\nThus, the definition of efficiency, $\\eta$, is:\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{\\text{Useful energy stored}}{\\text{Total energy released}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{ATP}} \\cdot \\Delta G_{\\text{ATP}}}{-\\Delta G_{\\text{glc}}} $$\nThis equation is the formal expression relating the yield of $ATP$ to the thermodynamic properties of the coupled reactions and the efficiency of the conversion machinery. The problem asks for the derivation of an analytical expression for $n_{\\text{ATP}}$, the number of moles of $ATP$ synthesized per mole of glucose. We can obtain this by rearranging the efficiency equation.\n\nSolving for $n_{\\text{ATP}}$ from first principles yields:\n$$ n_{\\text{ATP}} = \\eta \\cdot \\frac{-\\Delta G_{\\text{glc}}}{\\Delta G_{\\text{ATP}}} $$\nThis is the required analytical expression. It represents the number of moles of $ATP$ produced per mole of glucose oxidized by a consortium operating at a thermodynamic efficiency of $\\eta$.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided values:\n- $\\eta \\approx 0.4$\n- $\\Delta G_{\\text{glc}} \\approx -2870~\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$\n- $\\Delta G_{\\text{ATP}} \\approx 50~\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$ n_{\\text{ATP}} = (0.4) \\cdot \\frac{-(-2870~\\text{kJ mol}^{-1})}{50~\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}} $$\nThe units of energy per mole ($\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$) in the numerator and denominator cancel, yielding a dimensionless number as expected for a molar ratio.\n$$ n_{\\text{ATP}} = 0.4 \\cdot \\frac{2870}{50} $$\n$$ n_{\\text{ATP}} = 0.4 \\cdot 57.4 $$\n$$ n_{\\text{ATP}} = 22.96 $$\nThe problem requires the final numerical answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $22.96$ rounded to three significant figures is $23.0$.
