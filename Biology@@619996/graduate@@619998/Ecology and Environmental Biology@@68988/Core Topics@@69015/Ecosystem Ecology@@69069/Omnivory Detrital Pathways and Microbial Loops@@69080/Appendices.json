The problem is well-posed; it provides all necessary data and definitions for a unique solution. The diet fractions sum to $0.50 + 0.30 + 0.20 = 1.00$, ensuring internal consistency. The problem statement is objective and devoid of ambiguity. It does not violate any fundamental principles and is fully formalizable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution is therefore warranted and will be derived from the provided principles.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe trophic position of a consumer, $TP_{\\text{consumer}}$, is defined as one level above the mean trophic position of its food sources. This is expressed mathematically as:\n$$TP_{\\text{consumer}} = 1 + \\langle TP_{\\text{prey}} \\rangle$$\nwhere $\\langle TP_{\\text{prey}} \\rangle$ is the weighted average trophic position of the prey items in the diet. The problem specifies that this average is calculated using the diet fractions as weights.\nLet $d_i$ be the diet fraction of food source $i$, and let $TP_i$ be the trophic position of that food source. The mean prey trophic position is given by the sum:\n$$\\langle TP_{\\text{prey}} \\rangle = \\sum_{i} d_i \\cdot TP_i$$\nWe are given three food sources for the fish:\n1.  Primary producers with $TP_1 = 1$ and diet fraction $d_1 = 0.50$.\n2.  Herbivores with $TP_2 = 2$ and diet fraction $d_2 = 0.30$.\n3.  Detritus with $TP_3 = 1$ and diet fraction $d_3 = 0.20$.\n\nWe substitute these values into the expression for the mean prey trophic position:\n$$\\langle TP_{\\text{prey}} \\rangle = (d_1 \\cdot TP_1) + (d_2 \\cdot TP_2) + (d_3 \\cdot TP_3)$$\n$$\\langle TP_{\\text{prey}} \\rangle = (0.50 \\cdot 1) + (0.30 \\cdot 2) + (0.20 \\cdot 1)$$\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$\\langle TP_{\\text{prey}} \\rangle = 0.50 + 0.60 + 0.20 = 1.30$$\nNow, we calculate the fish's trophic position, $TP_{\\text{fish}}$:\n$$TP_{\\text{fish}} = 1 + \\langle TP_{\\text{prey}} \\rangle = 1 + 1.30 = 2.30$$\nThe problem requires this value rounded to three significant figures, which is $2.30$.\n\nNext, we must evaluate whether the fish qualifies as an omnivore based on the given operational criterion: obtaining at least $0.10$ of its diet from at least two distinct trophic levels.\nFirst, we aggregate the diet fractions by the trophic level of the food source.\n-   Diet from trophic level $1$: This includes primary producers ($d_1 = 0.50$) and detritus ($d_3 = 0.20$).\n    The total fraction from $TP = 1$ is $0.50 + 0.20 = 0.70$.\n-   Diet from trophic level $2$: This includes herbivores ($d_2 = 0.30$).\n    The total fraction from $TP = 2$ is $0.30$.\n\nThe fish feeds on two distinct trophic levels, $1$ and $2$.\nThe diet fraction from trophic level $1$ is $0.70$, which is greater than the threshold of $0.10$.\nThe diet fraction from trophic level $2$ is $0.30$, which is also greater than the threshold of $0.10$.\nSince both conditions are met (feeding on at least two trophic levels, with a diet fraction $\\ge 0.10$ from each), the fish is classified as an omnivore. Therefore, the omnivory indicator $O$ is $1$.\n\nThe final answer is to be presented as a row matrix containing the fractional trophic position and the omnivory indicator.\nThe calculated trophic position is $2.30$.\nThe omnivory indicator is $O=1$.\n\nThe resulting matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} 2.30 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2.30 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2515331"}, {"introduction": "Beyond identifying omnivores, it is crucial to understand the selective pressures that favor this strategy.

The parameters provided (C:N ratios, assimilation efficiencies) are within realistic ranges for aquatic ecosystems. The problem is well-posed, providing a complete and consistent set of definitions and constraints that allow for the construction of a solvable system of mass-balance equations. The language is objective and unambiguous. It is a formal problem in theoretical ecology, directly related to the specified topics. The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds by applying the principles of mass conservation for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) through the processes of ingestion, assimilation, egestion, growth, and respiration. Let all quantities be expressed as rates (e.g., moles per unit time), although the specific units are arbitrary and will cancel out. Let $I_C$ denote the total rate of carbon ingestion.\n\nThe fractions of ingested carbon from detritus and algae are given as $\\phi_d = 0.6$ and $\\phi_a = 0.4$, respectively. The rates of carbon ingestion from each source are:\n$$I_{C,d} = \\phi_d I_C = 0.6 I_C$$\n$$I_{C,a} = \\phi_a I_C = 0.4 I_C$$\n\nThe molar C:N ratios of the resources are $\\theta_d = 25$ for detritus and $\\theta_a = 6$ for algae. The rates of nitrogen ingestion are found by dividing the carbon ingestion rates by the respective C:N ratios:\n$$I_{N,d} = \\frac{I_{C,d}}{\\theta_d} = \\frac{0.6 I_C}{25}$$\n$$I_{N,a} = \\frac{I_{C,a}}{\\theta_a} = \\frac{0.4 I_C}{6}$$\n\nThe assimilation efficiencies (AE) are given as $\\eta_d = 0.2$ for detritus and $\\eta_a = 0.6$ for algae. These are elementally unbiased. The rates of assimilation for carbon and nitrogen are calculated by multiplying the ingestion rates by the corresponding AEs.\n\nThe total rate of assimilated carbon, $A_C$, is the sum of assimilated carbon from both sources:\n$$A_C = I_{C,d} \\eta_d + I_{C,a} \\eta_a = (0.6 I_C)(0.2) + (0.4 I_C)(0.6)$$\n$$A_C = 0.12 I_C + 0.24 I_C = 0.36 I_C$$\n\nSimilarly, the total rate of assimilated nitrogen, $A_N$, is:\n$$A_N = I_{N,d} \\eta_d + I_{N,a} \\eta_a = \\left(\\frac{0.6 I_C}{25}\\right)(0.2) + \\left(\\frac{0.4 I_C}{6}\\right)(0.6)$$\n$$A_N = I_C \\left(\\frac{0.12}{25} + \\frac{0.24}{6}\\right) = I_C (0.0048 + 0.04) = 0.0448 I_C$$\n\nAccording to the problem statement, all assimilated nitrogen is incorporated into new biomass (growth). Let $G_N$ be the rate of nitrogen incorporation into growth. Thus, $G_N = A_N$. The consumer's growth requires a fixed molar C:N ratio of $\\theta_{cons} = 5$. The rate of carbon incorporation into growth, $G_C$, is therefore:\n$$G_C = G_N \\cdot \\theta_{cons} = A_N \\cdot \\theta_{cons} = (0.0448 I_C)(5) = 0.224 I_C$$\n\nNow we determine the final fates of the total ingested carbon, $I_C$. The ingested carbon is partitioned into three pathways: egestion ($E_C$), growth ($G_C$), and respiration ($R_C$). The sum of these fates must equal the total ingested carbon: $I_C = E_C + G_C + R_C$.\n\nThe egested carbon is defined as the unassimilated portion of ingested carbon:\n$$E_C = I_C - A_C = I_C - 0.36 I_C = 0.64 I_C$$\nThe fraction of total ingested carbon that is egested, $f_{egest}$, is:\n$$f_{egest} = \\frac{E_C}{I_C} = \\frac{0.64 I_C}{I_C} = 0.64$$\n\nThe respired carbon is the surplus assimilated carbon that is not incorporated into growth. This follows from the carbon balance on assimilated material: $A_C = G_C + R_C$.\n$$R_C = A_C - G_C = 0.36 I_C - 0.224 I_C = 0.136 I_C$$\nThe fraction of total ingested carbon that is respired, $f_{resp}$, is:\n$$f_{resp} = \\frac{R_C}{I_C} = \\frac{0.136 I_C}{I_C} = 0.136$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer as a row matrix of decimal fractions rounded to four significant figures.\n$$f_{resp} = 0.1360$$\n$$f_{egest} = 0.6400$$\nFor completeness, the fraction of ingested carbon allocated to growth is $f_{growth} = G_C / I_C = 0.2240$. The sum of the fractions is $f_{egest} + f_{resp} + f_{growth} = 0.6400 + 0.1360 + 0.2240 = 1.0000$. The mass balance is closed, which confirms the consistency of the calculation.

The outcome of this competition is determined by their respective minimum resource requirements for survival, denoted $R^{\\star}_{C}$ and $R^{\\star}_{P}$.\nFor consumer $C$, break-even requires $e_C a_{CR} R - m_C = 0$:\n$$\nR^{\\star}_{C} = \\frac{m_C}{e_C a_{CR}} = \\frac{0.1}{0.5 \\times 0.4} = \\frac{0.1}{0.2} = 0.5\n$$\nFor predator $P$, break-even requires $e_P a_{PR} R - m_P = 0$:\n$$\nR^{\\star}_{P} = \\frac{m_P}{e_P a_{PR}} = \\frac{0.15}{0.6 \\times 0.2} = \\frac{0.15}{0.12} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25\n$$\nAccording to the principle of competitive exclusion ($R^{\\star}$-rule), the consumer with the lower minimum resource requirement will outcompete the other. In this case, $R^{\\star}_{C} < R^{\\star}_{P}$ ($0.5 < 1.25$). This means consumer $C$ is the superior competitor. In the absence of omnivory, $C$ would drive the resource $R$ down to a level of $0.5$, which is below the level of $1.25$ required for $P$ to persist. Consequently, $P$ would be driven to extinction.\nTherefore, in the counterfactual system with $a_{PC} = 0$, consumer $C$ persists, while $P$ does not. Omnivory ($a_{PC} > 0$) is thus the mechanism that allows the predator $P$ to persist by providing it with an additional food source ($C$). This predation pressure on $C$ raises the equilibrium resource level $R^{\\star}$ from $0.5$ to $1$, a level high enough to support $C$ but below the level $P$ would need without feeding on $C$.\nThe question asks whether the solution exhibits \"omnivory-driven persistence of $C$\". The analysis shows that $C$ would persist even without omnivory; in fact, it would thrive at a higher biomass. The presence of omnivory introduces a source of mortality for $C$ and is therefore detrimental to its population, not beneficial. Thus, for this parameterization, the persistence of $C$ is not driven by omnivory. Rather, the persistence of $P$ is driven by omnivory, which in turn establishes the three-species community in which $C$ persists at a lower density.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2515266"}]}
