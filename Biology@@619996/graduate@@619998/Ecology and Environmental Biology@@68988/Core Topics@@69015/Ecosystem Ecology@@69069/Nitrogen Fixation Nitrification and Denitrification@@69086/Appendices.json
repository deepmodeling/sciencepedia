We will proceed with its analysis.\n\nThe system is governed by two primary relationships: the mass balance for total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) and the acid-base equilibrium of the ammonium-ammonia pair.\n\nFirst, we define the total ammonia nitrogen, $C_T$, as the sum of the nitrogen concentrations from the un-ionized ammonia species, $\\mathrm{NH_3}$, and the ionized ammonium species, $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$. The problem specifies that concentrations are expressed on a nitrogen basis (e.g., mg-N L$^{-1}$), which implies a $1:1$ stoichiometric relationship.

According to Le ChÃ¢telier's principle applied to the equilibrium $\\mathrm{NH_4^+} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{NH_3} + \\mathrm{H^+}$, an increase in $pH$ corresponds to a decrease in $[\\mathrm{H^+}]$. The equilibrium will shift to the right to counteract this change, resulting in the conversion of $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$ to $\\mathrm{NH_3}$. This is reflected in the derived formula for $f_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}$: as $pH$ increases, the exponent $(pK_a - pH)$ decreases, causing the term $10^{pK_a - pH}$ to decrease, and thus the fraction $f_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}$ increases. An increase in the concentration of free ammonia, $[\\mathrm{NH_3}]$, makes more substrate available to the AMO enzyme, which can enhance the rate of nitrification. However, because high concentrations of free ammonia are inhibitory, a continued increase in $pH$ will eventually raise $[\\mathrm{NH_3}]$ above the inhibition threshold, $K_{i,\\mathrm{FA}}$, leading to a decrease in enzyme activity.
