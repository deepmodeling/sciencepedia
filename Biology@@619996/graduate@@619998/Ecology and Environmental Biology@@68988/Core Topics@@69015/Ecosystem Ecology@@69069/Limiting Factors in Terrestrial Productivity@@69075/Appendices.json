We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing carbon flow in an autotroph is the law of conservation of mass. The total carbon fixed through photosynthesis, known as Gross Primary Productivity ($GPP$), is allocated to two main processes: autotrophic respiration ($R_a$), which is the carbon respired to support metabolic activities, and Net Primary Productivity ($NPP$), which represents the net accumulation of carbon as biomass. The balance is expressed as:\n$$\nGPP = NPP + R_a\n$$\n\nThe problem states that autotrophic respiration ($R_a$) consists of two components: maintenance respiration ($R_m$) and growth respiration ($R_g$).\n$$\nR_a = R_m + R_g\n$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the maintenance respiration ($R_m$).

The statement that \"All quantities are expressed in a single, internally consistent unit system\" provides a clear rule for computation, even if the numerical values might seem unusual when compared to standard literature units. Such a setup is a valid premise for a problem designed to test the application of a model.\n\nStep 3: Verdict\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe gross rate of $\\text{CO}_2$ assimilation, denoted as $A$, is determined by the minimum of the potential rates imposed by different biophysical and biochemical constraints. In this problem, we consider limitation by Rubisco activity ($W_c$) and by the rate of electron transport ($W_j$). The gross assimilation rate is thus $A = \\min(W_c, W_j)$. The net assimilation rate is $A_n = A - R_d$. The factor limiting $A$ also limits $A_n$.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the Rubisco-limited rate of carboxylation, $W_c$. The carboxylation reaction catalyzed by Rubisco follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Oxygen, $\\text{O}_2$, acts as a competitive inhibitor to carbon dioxide, $\\text{CO}_2$, at the enzyme's active site. The rate equation for enzyme kinetics with a competitive inhibitor is $v = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{max}}[S]}{[S] + K_m (1 + [I]/K_i)}$, where $[S]$ is the substrate concentration and $[I]$ is the inhibitor concentration. Applying this to Rubisco, the substrate is $\\text{CO}_2$ at intercellular concentration $C_i$, the inhibitor is $\\text{O}_2$ at concentration $O$, the maximum velocity is $V_{\\mathrm{cmax}}$, the Michaelis-Menten constant for $\\text{CO}_2$ is $K_c$, and the constant for $\\text{O}_2$ is $K_o$. Therefore, the Rubisco-limited potential carboxylation rate is:\n$$W_c = V_{\\mathrm{cmax}} \\frac{C_i}{C_i + K_c \\left(1 + \\frac{O}{K_o}\\right)}$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the electron-transport-limited rate of carboxylation, $W_j$. When the rate of photosynthesis is limited by the light-dependent reactions, it is constrained by the rate of electron transport, $J$, which provides ATP and NADPH for the regeneration of RuBP in the Calvin-Benson cycle. The total electron flow supports both carboxylation (rate $v_c$) and the competing oxygenation reaction (rate $v_o$). The standard stoichiometric model requires $4$ electrons for each RuBP molecule that is turned over, whether by carboxylation or oxygenation. Thus, the total electron flux is $J = 4(v_c + v_o)$. The ratio of oxygenation to carboxylation, $\\phi = v_o/v_c$, can be related to the photorespiratory compensation point $\\Gamma^\\ast$. By definition, at $C_i = \\Gamma^\\ast$, the gross rate of carboxylation is half the rate of oxygenation ($v_c = 0.5 v_o$), which results in zero net carbon gain from photosynthesis and photorespiration. The ratio of reaction rates is also determined by competitive kinetics, $\\phi = \\frac{v_o}{v_c} = (\\frac{V_{omax} K_c}{V_{cmax} K_o}) \\frac{O}{C_i}$, and using the definition of $\\Gamma^\\ast$, this simplifies to $\\phi = \\frac{2\\Gamma^\\ast}{C_i}$. Substituting this into the electron flux equation gives $J = 4(v_c + v_c \\frac{2\\Gamma^\\ast}{C_i}) = 4v_c(1 + \\frac{2\\Gamma^\\ast}{C_i})$. Solving for $v_c$ gives the potential carboxylation rate determined by electron transport. Since PAR is saturating, we use the maximum rate $J_{\\mathrm{max}}$:\n$$W_j = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{max}}}{4\\left(1 + \\frac{2\\Gamma^\\ast}{C_i}\\right)} = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{max}}}{4} \\frac{C_i}{C_i + 2\\Gamma^\\ast}$$\n\nNow, we compute the values of $W_c$ and $W_j$ using the provided parameters:\n$V_{\\mathrm{cmax}}=60$, $J_{\\mathrm{max}}=120$, $C_i=250$, $\\Gamma^\\ast=40$, $K_c=404$, $K_o=278$, $O=21000$.\n\nCalculation of $W_c$:\n$$W_c = 60 \\cdot \\frac{250}{250 + 404 \\left(1 + \\frac{21000}{278}\\right)}$$\n$$W_c = 60 \\cdot \\frac{250}{250 + 404 \\left(\\frac{278 + 21000}{278}\\right)} = 60 \\cdot \\frac{250}{250 + 404 \\left(\\frac{21278}{278}\\right)}$$\n$$W_c = 60 \\cdot \\frac{250}{250 + \\frac{8596312}{278}} = 60 \\cdot \\frac{250 \\cdot 278}{250 \\cdot 278 + 8596312}$$\n$$W_c = \\frac{15000 \\cdot 278}{69500 + 8596312} = \\frac{4170000}{8665812} \\approx 0.4812$$\n\nCalculation of $W_j$:\n$$W_j = \\frac{120}{4} \\cdot \\frac{250}{250 + 2(40)} = 30 \\cdot \\frac{250}{250 + 80} = 30 \\cdot \\frac{250}{330}$$\n$$W_j = 30 \\cdot \\frac{25}{33} = \\frac{750}{33} = \\frac{250}{11} \\approx 22.727$$\n\nComparing the two potential rates:\n$$W_c \\approx 0.4812$$\n$$W_j \\approx 22.727$$\nSince $W_c < W_j$, the gross assimilation rate $A$ is limited by the capacity of Rubisco.\n$$A = \\min(W_c, W_j) = W_c$$\nThe net assimilation rate $A_n$ is therefore also Rubisco-limited.
