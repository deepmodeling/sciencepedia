It can be expressed as a multiple linear regression model $Y = \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2$, where $X_1 = t$, $X_2 = (t-90)I(t>90)$, $\\beta_1 = k_1$, and $\\beta_2 = k_2-k_1$. The single-phase model $M_0$ is a special case of $M_1$ where $k_1=k_2$, which implies $\\beta_2=0$. This is our null hypothesis, $H_0: \\beta_2 = 0$.\nThe likelihood ratio test statistic $\\lambda$ is given by:\n$$ \\lambda = 2(\\ell_{M_1} - \\ell_{M_0}) = N \\ln\\left(\\frac{SSE_0}{SSE_1}\\right) $$\nUnder $H_0$, $\\lambda$ follows a chi-squared distribution with $q$ degrees of freedom, where $q$ is the difference in the number of parameters between the models ($q = 2 - 1 = 1$).\nWe already have $SSE_0 = 0.0602217$. We need to calculate $SSE_1$. This is the residual sum of squares for the two-phase model. We find the MLEs for $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ by solving the normal equations $(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = \\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{Y}$.\nFrom the data, we construct $\\mathbf{X}$ and $\\mathbf{Y}$. The sums for the normal equations are: $\\sum X_{1,i}^2 = 82800$, $\\sum X_{2,i}^2 = 2 \\times 90^2 = 16200$, $\\sum X_{1,i}X_{2,i} = 2 \\times 180 \\times 90 = 32400$. Also $\\sum X_{1,i}Y_i = 367.8$ and $\\sum X_{2,i}Y_i = (0.74+0.70)\\times 90 = 129.6$.\nSolving the system yields $\\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\hat{k}_1 \\approx 0.006033$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_2 = \\hat{k}_2-\\hat{k}_1 \\approx -0.004067$.\nThe sum of squared errors for model $M_1$ is $SSE_1 = \\sum Y^2 - \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}^T \\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{Y}$:\n$$ SSE_1 = 1.694 - [(\\hat{\\beta}_1)(367.8) + (\\hat{\\beta}_2)(129.6)] $$\n$$ SSE_1 = 1.694 - [(0.0060333...)(367.8) + (-0.0040666...)(129.6)] \\approx 1.694 - [2.219 - 0.527] = 1.694 - 1.692 = 0.002 $$\nA more precise calculation gives $SSE_1 \\approx 0.00198$.\nNow, we compute the test statistic $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda = 6 \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.0602217}{0.00198}\\right) \\approx 6 \\ln(30.415) \\approx 6(3.415) \\approx 20.49 $$\nThe critical value of the $\\chi^2_1$ distribution for a significance level of $\\alpha=0.05$ is $3.84$. Since our test statistic $\\lambda \\approx 20.49$ is much greater than $3.84$, we reject the null hypothesis. The data provide strong evidence against the single-phase model in favor of the two-phase model, indicating a significant change in the decay rate after $t=90$ days.\n\nThe final answer required is the numerical estimate of the single-phase decay constant $k$, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\hat{k} \\approx 0.004442 \\text{ day}^{-1} $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.004442}\n$$", "id": "2479622"}]}
