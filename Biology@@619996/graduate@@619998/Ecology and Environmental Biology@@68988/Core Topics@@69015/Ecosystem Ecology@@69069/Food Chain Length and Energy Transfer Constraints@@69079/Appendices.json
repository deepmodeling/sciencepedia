The model is a standard and acceptable simplification for analyzing energy flow in ecosystems. It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe energy available to a given trophic level $L$, which we denote as $E_L$, must be formulated as a function of the basal input $I$ and the transfer efficiency $\\epsilon$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, trophic level $L=1$ corresponds to primary producers, so the energy available to this level is the basal input itself:\n$$E_1 = I$$\n\nFor the next level, $L=2$, the energy is transferred from level $1$ across one trophic link. The energy available is:\n$$E_2 = E_1 \\times \\epsilon = I \\epsilon^{1} = I \\epsilon^{2-1}$$\n\nFor trophic level $L=3$, the energy is transferred from level $2$ across another link. The energy available is:\n$$E_3 = E_2 \\times \\epsilon = (I \\epsilon) \\epsilon = I \\epsilon^{2} = I \\epsilon^{3-1}$$\n\nBy induction, the energy available at an arbitrary trophic level $L$ is given by the basal input multiplied by the efficiency $\\epsilon$ raised to the power of the number of trophic links below it, which is $(L-1)$. This gives the general formula:\n$$E_L = I \\epsilon^{L-1}$$\n\nFor a guild of apex consumers at trophic level $L$ to be demographically viable, the energy available to it, $E_L$, must be greater than or equal to the minimum required energy throughput, $E_{\\min}$.

First, we isolate the term containing $L$:\n$$\\epsilon^{L-1} \\geq \\frac{E_{\\min}}{I}$$\n\nTo solve for the exponent $(L-1)$, we take the logarithm of both sides. It is critical to note that the trophic transfer efficiency $\\epsilon$ is a value between $0$ and $1$ ($0  \\epsilon  1$), which means its logarithm is negative ($\\ln(\\epsilon)  0$).

This is true. The equilibrium point is positive.\n\n**Step 2: Stability analysis of the three-level equilibrium**\n\nThe Jacobian matrix of the $(R, H, C)$ subsystem is:\n$$\nJ = \\begin{pmatrix}\nr - \\frac{2rR}{K} - f'_1(R)H  -f_1(R)  0 \\\\\ne_1 f'_1(R)H  e_1 f_1(R) - f'_2(H)C - m_1  -f_2(H) \\\\\n0  e_2 f'_2(H)C  e_2 f_2(H) - m_2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nAt equilibrium $(R^{*}, H^{*}, C^{*})$, several terms simplify: $e_2 f_2(H^{*}) - m_2 = 0$, $f_2(H^*) = m_2/e_2$, $e_1 f_1(R^{*}) - m_1 = \\frac{f_2(H^{*})C^{*}}{H^{*}}$.\nThe Jacobian at equilibrium, $J^*$, is:\n$$\nJ^{*} = \\begin{pmatrix}\nJ_{11}^{*}  J_{12}^{*}  0 \\\\\nJ_{21}^{*}  J_{22}^{*}  J_{23}^{*} \\\\\n0  J_{32}^{*}  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere\n$J_{11}^{*} = R^{*}\\left(\\frac{a_1^2h_1H^{*}}{(1+a_1h_1R^{*})^2} - \\frac{r}{K}\\right) \\approx 4.039\\left(\\frac{1^2 \\cdot 0.5 \\cdot (75/76)}{(1+0.5 \\cdot 4.039)^2} - \\frac{1}{6}\\right) \\approx -0.455$\n$J_{12}^{*} = -f_1(R^{*}) = -\\frac{a_1 R^{*}}{1+a_1 h_1 R^{*}} \\approx -1.338$\n$J_{21}^{*} = e_1 f'_1(R^{*})H^{*} = e_1 \\frac{a_1 H^{*}}{(1+a_1 h_1 R^{*})^2} \\approx 0.3 \\frac{1 \\cdot (75/76)}{(1+0.5 \\cdot 4.039)^2} \\approx 0.0325$\n$J_{22}^{*} = C^{*}\\left(\\frac{f_2(H^{*})}{H^{*}} - f'_2(H^{*})\\right) = C^{*} \\frac{a_2^2 h_2 H^{*}}{(1+a_2 h_2 H^{*})^2} \\approx 0.1995 \\frac{0.8^2 \\cdot 0.4 \\cdot (75/76)}{(1+0.8 \\cdot 0.4 \\cdot (75/76))^2} \\approx 0.0291$\n$J_{23}^{*} = -f_2(H^{*}) = -m_2/e_2 = -0.15/0.25 = -0.6$\n$J_{32}^{*} = e_2 f'_2(H^{*})C^{*} = e_2 \\frac{a_2 C^{*}}{(1+a_2 h_2 H^{*})^2} \\approx 0.25 \\frac{0.8 \\cdot 0.1995}{(1+0.8 \\cdot 0.4 \\cdot (75/76))^2} \\approx 0.0230$\n\nThe characteristic polynomial is $\\det(J^{*} - \\lambda I) = \\lambda^3 + A_1\\lambda^2 + A_2\\lambda + A_3 = 0$, with coefficients:\n$A_1 = -(J_{11}^{*} + J_{22}^{*})$\n$A_2 = J_{11}^{*}J_{22}^{*} - J_{12}^{*}J_{21}^{*} - J_{23}^{*}J_{32}^{*}$\n$A_3 = -J_{11}^{*}J_{23}^{*}J_{32}^{*}$\n\nUsing the numerical values:\n$A_1 \\approx -(-0.455 + 0.0291) = 0.4259$\n$A_2 \\approx (-0.455)(0.0291) - (-1.338)(0.0325) - (-0.6)(0.0230) \\approx -0.0132 + 0.0435 + 0.0138 = 0.0441$\n$A_3 = -J_{11}^*J_{23}^*J_{32}^*$.\nLet's check the signs of the components: $J_{11}^*  0$, $J_{23}^*  0$, $J_{32}^*  0$.\nSo $A_3 = - (\\text{neg}) \\times (\\text{neg}) \\times (\\text{pos}) = -(\\text{positive}) = \\text{negative}$.\nThe Routh-Hurwitz criteria for a cubic require all coefficients $A_1, A_2, A_3$ to be positive. Since $A_3  0$, the equilibrium is unstable.\n\nThe Routh-Hurwitz conditions are:\n1. $A_1  0$\n2. $A_3  0$\n3. $A_1 A_2 - A_3  0$\n\nCondition (2) is not satisfied, since $A_3  0$. Therefore, the three-level equilibrium is unstable.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluation of the feasibility indicator S**\n\nThe feasibility indicator $S$ is defined as:\n$$\nS = \\begin{cases}\n1,  \\text{if the resident three-level equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable and } e_3 f_3(C^{*}) - m_3  0,\\\\\n0,  \\text{otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nWe have found that the resident equilibrium is not locally asymptotically stable. This violates the first condition required for $S=1$.\nWe need not proceed to check the invasion condition. The \"otherwise\" clause is triggered.\n\nFor completeness, let's check the invasion condition anyway. The top predator can invade if its per-capita growth rate is positive:\n$$\ne_3 f_3(C^{*}) - m_3 = e_3 \\frac{a_3 C^{*}}{1 + a_3 h_3 C^{*}} - m_3  0\n$$\nThis is equivalent to $C^{*}  \\frac{m_3}{e_3 a_3 - m_3 a_3 h_3} = \\frac{m_3}{a_3(e_3 - m_3 h_3)}$.\nUsing parameters $e_3=0.2, m_3=0.04, a_3=0.6, h_3=0.3$:\n$$\nC^{*}  \\frac{0.04}{0.6(0.2 - 0.04 \\cdot 0.3)} = \\frac{0.04}{0.6(0.2 - 0.012)} = \\frac{0.04}{0.6 \\cdot 0.188} = \\frac{0.04}{0.1128} \\approx 0.3546\n$$\nThe equilibrium carnivore density is $C^{*} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1501}-16}{114} \\approx \\frac{38.74 - 16}{114} \\approx 0.1995$.\nSince $0.1995  0.3546$, the invasion condition is not met. The top predator cannot establish itself in this system.\n\nBoth conditions for $S=1$ fail. The resident equilibrium is unstable, and the top predator's invasion growth rate is negative. Therefore, the feasibility indicator $S$ must be $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2492357"}]}
