Determine if the long-term outcome for the given parameters is competitive exclusion or stable coexistence.\n    4. Compute the equilibrium abundance of species $1$, $N_1$, rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem is evaluated against the required criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The Lotka-Volterra model is a cornerstone of theoretical ecology. The problem is firmly rooted in established scientific principles.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a complete set of equations and parameters, and asks for a standard stability analysis and equilibrium calculation. A unique and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective:** The language is precise and mathematical, free from subjectivity.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** All information required for the analysis is provided. There are no contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a well-formulated, standard problem in mathematical biology. We proceed to the solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the general conditions for coexistence. The equilibria of the system are found by setting the time derivatives to zero: $\\frac{dN_1}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dN_2}{dt} = 0$. This yields four possible equilibria:\n1.  The trivial equilibrium: $(N_1, N_2) = (0, 0)$.\n2.  Exclusion of species $2$: $(N_1, N_2) = (K_1, 0)$.\n3.  Exclusion of species $1$: $(N_1, N_2) = (0, K_2)$.\n4.  The coexistence equilibrium, where $N_1 > 0$ and $N_2 > 0$. This equilibrium, denoted $(N_1^*, N_2^*)$, is found by solving the system of linear equations for the non-trivial nullclines (isoclines):\n    $$\n    N_1 + \\alpha_{12} N_2 = K_1\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\alpha_{21} N_1 + N_2 = K_2\n    $$\nSolving this system, for instance by using Cramer's rule or substitution, yields the coordinates of the internal equilibrium point:\n$$\nN_1^* = \\frac{K_1 - \\alpha_{12} K_2}{1 - \\alpha_{12}\\alpha_{21}}\n$$\n$$\nN_2^* = \\frac{K_2 - \\alpha_{21} K_1}{1 - \\alpha_{12}\\alpha_{21}}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the coexistence equilibrium. For this equilibrium to be biologically meaningful, we must have $N_1^* > 0$ and $N_2^* > 0$.\n\nThe stability of this system, and thus the long-term outcome, is determined by the mutual invasibility conditions. These conditions ascertain whether each species can increase from low numbers when its competitor is at its carrying capacity.\n- **Invasion by species 1:** Can species $1$ invade when species $2$ is at its carrying capacity, $N_2=K_2$? We evaluate $\\frac{dN_1}{dt}$ at $(N_1, N_2) \\approx (0, K_2)$. The growth rate of species $1$ is positive if:\n  $$\n  1 - \\frac{\\alpha_{12} K_2}{K_1} > 0 \\implies K_1 > \\alpha_{12} K_2\n  $$\n- **Invasion by species 2:** Can species $2$ invade when species $1$ is at its carrying capacity, $N_1=K_1$? We evaluate $\\frac{dN_2}{dt}$ at $(N_1, N_2) \\approx (K_1, 0)$. The growth rate of species $2$ is positive if:\n  $$\n  1 - \\frac{\\alpha_{21} K_1}{K_2} > 0 \\implies K_2 > \\alpha_{21} K_1\n  $$\nThese two inequalities, $K_1 > \\alpha_{12} K_2$ and $K_2 > \\alpha_{21} K_1$, are the **mutual invasibility conditions**. If both are met, the boundary equilibria $(K_1, 0)$ and $(0, K_2)$ are unstable, and the system converges to a stable coexistence equilibrium.\nThese conditions have a clear biological interpretation related to **limiting similarity**: each species must inhibit its own growth more strongly than it inhibits the growth of its competitor. The strength of intraspecific competition is scaled to $1$ (in units of $1/K_i$), while interspecific competition is scaled by $\\alpha_{ij}$. Thus, for stable coexistence, interspecific competition must be weaker than intraspecific competition. Note that these two conditions together imply $K_1 K_2 > (\\alpha_{12} K_2)(\\alpha_{21} K_1)$, which simplifies to $1 > \\alpha_{12}\\alpha_{21}$. This means that for the coexistence equilibrium $(N_1^*, N_2^*)$ to be both positive and stable, the numerators and the denominator in its expressions must all be positive.\n\nNow, we apply this framework to the given parameter set:\n- Parameters: $K_1 = 100$, $K_2 = 80$, $\\alpha_{12} = 0.6$, $\\alpha_{21} = 0.7$.\n- We check the mutual invasibility conditions:\n1.  Is $K_1 > \\alpha_{12} K_2$?\n    $$\n    100 > 0.6 \\times 80 \\implies 100 > 48\n    $$\n    This condition is satisfied.\n2.  Is $K_2 > \\alpha_{21} K_1$?\n    $$\n    80 > 0.7 \\times 100 \\implies 80 > 70\n    $$\n    This condition is also satisfied.\n\nSince both mutual invasibility conditions are met, the long-term outcome is **stable coexistence**, not competitive exclusion. The globally attracting equilibrium for any positive initial densities is the interior equilibrium $(N_1^*, N_2^*)$.\n\nFinally, we compute the equilibrium abundance for species $1$, $N_1^*$. Using the formula derived earlier:\n$$\nN_1^* = \\frac{K_1 - \\alpha_{12} K_2}{1 - \\alpha_{12}\\alpha_{21}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nN_1^* = \\frac{100 - (0.6)(80)}{1 - (0.6)(0.7)}\n$$\n$$\nN_1^* = \\frac{100 - 48}{1 - 0.42}\n$$\n$$\nN_1^* = \\frac{52}{0.58}\n$$\n$$\nN_1^* \\approx 89.65517...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$\nN_1^* \\approx 89.66\n$$\nThe abundance of species $1$ at the globally attracting equilibrium is $89.66$ individuals.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{89.66}\n$$", "id": "2478549"}, {"introduction": "While the Lotka-Volterra model describes the outcome of competition, mechanistic models explain its cause.

It is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and a clear objective. It is stated objectively and contains no factual unsoundness, contradictions, or unrealistic conditions within the context of a theoretical model. The problem is therefore deemed valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe condition for steady-state coexistence, $g_{i}(R^{\\ast}) = 0$, can be rewritten for each species as a linear equation:\n$c_{i} \\cdot R^{\\ast} = \\frac{m_{i}}{e_{i}}$.\nThis defines a system of $4$ linear equations in the $3$ unknown components of $R^{\\ast} = (R_{1}^{\\ast}, R_{2}^{\\ast}, R_{3}^{\\ast})$. We first compute the required resource-to-growth ratios, $\\frac{m_{i}}{e_{i}}$:\n$\\frac{m_{1}}{e_{1}} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$\n$\\frac{m_{2}}{e_{2}} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$\n$\\frac{m_{3}}{e_{3}} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$\n$\\frac{m_{4}}{e_{4}} = \\frac{5}{1} = 5$\n\nThe system of equations is:\n1. $c_{1} \\cdot R^{\\ast} = 1 R_{1}^{\\ast} + 0 R_{2}^{\\ast} + 1 R_{3}^{\\ast} = 2$\n2. $c_{2} \\cdot R^{\\ast} = 0 R_{1}^{\\ast} + 1 R_{2}^{\\ast} + 1 R_{3}^{\\ast} = 2$\n3. $c_{3} \\cdot R^{\\ast} = 1 R_{1}^{\\ast} + 1 R_{2}^{\\ast} + 0 R_{3}^{\\ast} = 2$\n4. $c_{4} \\cdot R^{\\ast} = 2 R_{1}^{\\ast} + 2 R_{2}^{\\ast} + 2 R_{3}^{\\ast} = 5$\n\nGeometrically, each equation describes a hyperplane in the $3$-dimensional resource space. A coexistence equilibrium $R^{\\ast}$ must be a point that lies on all four hyperplanes simultaneously. A fundamental principle of linear algebra dictates that a system of $n$ linear equations in $k$ unknowns, where $n > k$, generally has no solution. A solution can only exist if the equations are not linearly independent. Specifically, the number of linearly independent consumption vectors cannot exceed the number of resources. Since we have $4$ consumer species and $3$ resources, the four consumption vectors $c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, c_{4}$ must be linearly dependent for coexistence to be possible.\n\nWe must find a non-zero coefficient vector $a = (a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4})$ such that $\\sum_{i=1}^{4} a_{i} c_{i} = 0$. The vectors $c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}$ are linearly independent as the determinant of the matrix formed by them is $\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 1(0-1) - 0(0-1) + 1(0-1) = -2 \\neq 0$. Thus, they form a basis for $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, and $c_{4}$ can be uniquely expressed as their linear combination. Let $c_{4} = x c_{1} + y c_{2} + z c_{3}$.\n$(2, 2, 2) = x(1, 0, 1) + y(0, 1, 1) + z(1, 1, 0) = (x+z, y+z, x+y)$.\nThis yields the system:\n$x + z = 2$\n$y + z = 2$\n$x + y = 2$\nSolving this system gives $x=1$, $y=1$, and $z=1$.\nTherefore, the linear dependency is $c_{4} = c_{1} + c_{2} + c_{3}$, which can be written as $1 c_{1} + 1 c_{2} + 1 c_{3} - 1 c_{4} = 0$.\n\nThis provides the coefficient vector $a = (1, 1, 1, -1)$. This vector has integer entries, its greatest common divisor is $\\text{gcd}(1, 1, 1, -1) = 1$, and its last entry is negative ($a_{4} = -1$), satisfying all conditions specified in the problem.\n\nFor the system of linear equations to be consistent, the same linear dependency must apply to the constant terms on the right-hand side. That is, it must be true that $\\sum_{i=1}^{4} a_{i} \\frac{m_{i}}{e_{i}} = 0$. The problem defines this sum as the inconsistency residual, $S$. If $S=0$, the system is consistent; if $S \\neq 0$, it is inconsistent and no solution exists.\nWe compute $S$:\n$S = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} a_{i} \\frac{m_{i}}{e_{i}} = a_{1}\\frac{m_{1}}{e_{1}} + a_{2}\\frac{m_{2}}{e_{2}} + a_{3}\\frac{m_{3}}{e_{3}} + a_{4}\\frac{m_{4}}{e_{4}}$\nSubstituting the values for $a_i$ and $\\frac{m_{i}}{e_{i}}$:\n$S = (1)(2) + (1)(2) + (1)(2) + (-1)(5)$\n$S = 2 + 2 + 2 - 5 = 6 - 5 = 1$.\n\nSince $S = 1 \\neq 0$, the system of equations is inconsistent. The four zero-growth hyperplanes do not intersect at a common point. The intersection of the first three planes occurs at the unique point $R^{\\ast} = (1, 1, 1)$. However, this point does not satisfy the fourth equation, as $c_{4} \\cdot (1, 1, 1) = (2, 2, 2) \\cdot (1, 1, 1) = 2+2+2 = 6$, but the condition requires $c_4 \\cdot R^* = 5$. The discrepancy $6-5=1$ is precisely the value of $S$.\n\nTherefore, a feasible steady state with all four species coexisting is impossible. The required calculation is the value of the inconsistency residual $S$.\n\nThe final calculation is simply the value of $S$ we have derived.\n$S = 1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2478501"}, {"introduction": "Theories of limiting similarity are built on the assumption that competitive impact is related to niche overlap, which can often be estimated by the distance between species in trait space.

The problem is to be validated and solved.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\nI will first validate the problem statement against the required criteria.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n- **Context**: Generalized Lotka-Volterra competition framework, kernel-based limiting similarity hypothesis.\n- **Hypothesis**: The magnitude of competitive interaction $|\\alpha_{ij}|$ is a non-increasing function of trait distance $d_{ij} = |z_i - z_j|$.\n- **Inputs**: For each test case, a vector of species traits $z \\in \\mathbb{R}^S$ and a pairwise interaction matrix $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}^{S \\times S}$.\n- **Task**: For each case, perform a statistical analysis to test the hypothesis.\n- **Procedure**:\n    1.  Construct trait distance matrix $D$ where $D_{ij} = |z_i - z_j|$.\n    2.  Construct interaction magnitude matrix $M$ where $M_{ij} = |\\alpha_{ij}|$.\n    3.  Compute the Spearman rank correlation $\\rho$ between the vectorized upper-triangular, off-diagonal elements of $D$ and $M$.\n    4.  Compute a one-tailed permutation $p$-value for the alternative hypothesis $H_A : \\rho < 0$. This is done via a Mantel test with $B = 999$ permutations and a fixed random seed of $12345$. The rows and columns of $M$ are permuted, and the correlation is recomputed against the fixed $D$.\n    5.  The $p$-value is defined as $p = \\frac{1 + \\#\\{ b \\mid \\rho^{(b)} \\le \\rho^{\\mathrm{obs}} \\}}{1 + B}$.\n    6.  The hypothesis is considered supported if and only if $\\rho < 0$ and $p \\le 0.05$.\n- **Test Cases**: Four specific test cases are provided, with $S=5$, defined by trait vectors $z$ and interaction matrices $\\alpha$.\n- **Output**: A single-line string containing a list of results $(\\rho, p, \\text{decision})$ for each of the four cases, with floats rounded to six decimal places.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is well-grounded. The Lotka-Volterra model, the limiting similarity hypothesis, and the Mantel test are all standard concepts and methods in theoretical and computational ecology. The mathematical formulation is correct.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. All inputs ($z$, $\\alpha$), parameters ($B$, seed, significance level), and computational procedures (Spearman correlation, permutation method, p-value formula, decision rule) are precisely defined. This ensures that a unique and meaningful solution exists and can be computed.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem statement is objective, using precise mathematical and statistical language without any subjective or ambiguous terms.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. All data and parameters required for the solution are provided. There are no contradictions in the setup. For instance, the use of symmetric $\\alpha$ matrices with zero diagonals is a valid simplification for this type of modeling problem, and the analysis correctly focuses on the off-diagonal elements.\n- **Feasibility**: The specified computations are standard and computationally feasible. The matrix sizes are small ($5 \\times 5$), and $999$ permutations are easily manageable.\n- **Structure**: The problem is exceptionally well-structured, guiding the solver through a clear sequence of logical steps, from data preparation to statistical testing and final decision-making.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a clear, scientifically sound, and well-posed computational task. I will proceed with providing a complete solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution requires implementing a Mantel-type permutation test to evaluate the correlation between two distance matrices, one derived from species traits and the other from interaction strengths. This statistical test is appropriate because the elements within a distance matrix are not independent (e.g., $d_{13}$ is related to $d_{12}$ and $d_{23}$ through the triangle inequality), which violates the assumptions of standard correlation tests. The Mantel test correctly assesses significance by comparing the observed correlation to a distribution of correlations generated by permuting the species labels, thus preserving the internal dependency structure of the matrices.\n\nThe procedure will be implemented for each of the four test cases as follows:\n\n**1. Data Preparation**:\nFor a given number of species $S$, a trait vector $z \\in \\mathbb{R}^S$, and an interaction matrix $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}^{S \\times S}$:\n- The trait distance matrix $D \\in \\mathbb{R}^{S \\times S}$ is computed. Its elements are $D_{ij} = |z_i - z_j|$. This can be efficiently computed using vector broadcasting.\n- The interaction magnitude matrix $M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{S \\times S}$ is computed. Its elements are $M_{ij} = |\\alpha_{ij}|$.\n- To perform the correlation, the upper-triangular parts (excluding the diagonal, i.e., for indices $1 \\le i < j \\le S$) of both matrices $D$ and $M$ are extracted and flattened into vectors. Let these be $d_{\\text{vec}}$ and $m_{\\text{vec}}$.\n\n**2. Observed Correlation**:\nThe observed Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, $\\rho^{\\text{obs}}$, is computed between $d_{\\text{vec}}$ and $m_{\\text{vec}}$. Spearman correlation measures the strength and direction of a monotonic relationship between two variables. It is calculated as the Pearson correlation coefficient of the rank-transformed variables. It is robust to outliers and does not assume a linear relationship, which makes it suitable for the hypothesis that $|\\alpha_{ij}|$ is a *non-increasing function* of $d_{ij}$. A negative $\\rho^{\\text{obs}}$ would indicate that as trait distance increases, interaction magnitude tends to decrease, which is consistent with the limiting similarity hypothesis.\n\n**3. Permutation Test for Significance**:\nTo determine if the observed $\\rho^{\\text{obs}}$ is statistically significant, we generate a null distribution. The null hypothesis, $H_0$, is that there is no association between the trait distances and interaction magnitudes.\n- A random number generator is initialized with a fixed seed ($12345$) for reproducibility.\n- A loop runs $B = 999$ times. In each iteration $b$:\n    a. A random permutation $\\pi$ of the species indices $\\{1, \\dots, S\\}$ is generated.\n    b. This permutation is applied simultaneously to the rows and columns of the interaction magnitude matrix $M$ to produce a permuted matrix $M^{(b)}$. That is, $M^{(b)}_{ij} = M_{\\pi(i), \\pi(j)}$.\n    c. The upper-triangular part of $M^{(b)}$ is vectorized to create $m^{(b)}_{\\text{vec}}$.\n    d. The Spearman correlation $\\rho^{(b)}$ is computed between the fixed vector $d_{\\text{vec}}$ and the new vector $m^{(b)}_{\\text{vec}}$.\n- The collection of $\\{\\rho^{(1)}, \\dots, \\rho^{(B)}\\}$ forms the empirical null distribution.\n- The one-tailed $p$-value for the alternative hypothesis $H_A: \\rho < 0$ is calculated. This tests whether the observed negative correlation is more extreme than what would be expected by chance. The formula is:\n$$\np = \\frac{1 + \\text{count}(\\rho^{(b)} \\le \\rho^{\\text{obs}})}{1 + B}\n$$\nThe inclusion of $1$ in both the numerator and denominator accounts for the observed statistic itself as part of the null distribution and prevents a $p$-value of $0$.\n\n**4. Hypothesis Decision**:\nThe limiting similarity hypothesis is supported by the data if two conditions are met:\n1. The observed correlation must be negative: $\\rho^{\\text{obs}} < 0$.\n2. The result must be statistically significant at the $\\alpha=0.05$ level: $p \\le 0.05$.\n\nThis entire procedure is encapsulated in a program that processes all four provided test cases and formats the results—$\\rho^{\\text{obs}}$, $p$-value, and the boolean decision—into a single output line as specified. Case 1 and Case 4 are constructed to support the hypothesis, with $\\rho^{\\text{obs}} = -1.0$. Case 2 is random, so support is not expected. Case 3 is constructed to violate the hypothesis, with $\\rho^{\\text{obs}} = +1.0$, which will fail the first condition of the decision rule.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import spearmanr\n\ndef analyze_case(z, alpha, num_permutations, seed):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a Mantel test to check for limiting similarity.\n\n    Args:\n        z (list or np.ndarray): 1D array of trait values for S species.\n        alpha (list of lists or np.ndarray): SxS interaction matrix.\n        num_permutations (int): Number of permutations for the test.\n        seed (int): Seed for the random number generator.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (rho_rounded, p_value_rounded, is_supported)\n    \"\"\"\n    S = len(z)\n    \n    # 1.
