It presents a standard exercise in quantitative ecology. We shall proceed with the derivation from first principles.\n\nThe analysis concerns $3$ local communities, designated by the sets of species they contain: $A=\\{1,2,3\\}$, $B=\\{2,3,4\\}$, and $C=\\{3,4,5\\}$. The species are identified by integer labels.\n\nThe first quantity to be determined is the local species richness for each community, which is the alpha diversity, denoted as $\\alpha$. The richness of a set is its cardinality, which is the count of its distinct elements.\nFor community $A$, the species richness is $\\alpha_{A} = |A| = |\\{1,2,3\\}| = 3$.\nFor community $B$, the species richness is $\\alpha_{B} = |B| = |\\{2,3,4\\}| = 3$.\nFor community $C$, the species richness is $\\alpha_{C} = |C| = |\\{3,4,5\\}| = 3$.\n\nThe next quantity required is the mean local richness, denoted as $\\bar{\\alpha}$. This is defined as the arithmetic mean of the individual local richness values. For a system of $N$ communities, it is given by $\\bar{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\alpha_i$.\nIn this case, $N=3$, so we have:\n$$ \\bar{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\alpha_{A} + \\alpha_{B} + \\alpha_{C}}{3} = \\frac{3 + 3 + 3}{3} = \\frac{9}{3} = 3 $$\nThus, the mean local richness is $\\bar{\\alpha} = 3$.\n\nThe third quantity is the regional richness, or gamma diversity, denoted as $\\gamma$. It is defined as the total number of species in the regional pool. The regional pool is the union of all local species sets.\nLet the regional species set be $R = A \\cup B \\cup C$.\n$$ R = \\{1,2,3\\} \\cup \\{2,3,4\\} \\cup \\{3,4,5\\} $$\nThe union of these sets contains all unique elements present across all sets:\n$$ R = \\{1,2,3,4,5\\} $$\nThe regional richness $\\gamma$ is the cardinality of this regional set:\n$$ \\gamma = |R| = |\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}| = 5 $$\nThus, the regional richness is $\\gamma = 5$.\n\nFinally, we must compute the Whittaker multiplicative beta diversity, $\\beta_{\\mathrm{W}}$. The problem statement provides its definition: it is the multiplicative factor by which regional richness exceeds mean local richness. This relationship is formally expressed as $\\gamma = \\bar{\\alpha} \\times \\beta_{\\mathrm{W}}$.\nTo find $\\beta_{\\mathrm{W}}$, we rearrange this fundamental equation:\n$$ \\beta_{\\mathrm{W}} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\bar{\\alpha}} $$\nSubstituting the computed values for $\\gamma$ and $\\bar{\\alpha}$:\n$$ \\beta_{\\mathrm{W}} = \\frac{5}{3} $$\nThis value represents the effective number of distinct communities in the region, reflecting the degree of compositional turnover among them.\n\nThe problem requires the final result as an ordered triple $(\\bar{\\alpha}, \\gamma, \\beta_{\\mathrm{W}})$. Based on our derivations, the components of this triple are:\nMean local richness, $\\bar{\\alpha} = 3$.\nRegional richness, $\\gamma = 5$.\nWhittaker beta diversity, $\\beta_{\\mathrm{W}} = \\frac{5}{3}$.\n\nThe final result is provided in exact fractional form as required.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 5 & \\frac{5}{3} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2470400"}, {"introduction": "Once we can calculate beta diversity, the next crucial step is to interpret what this differentiation represents ecologically. Community composition can change between sites either because species are replaced (turnover) or because species are lost from a richer community to form a nested subset (nestedness). This conceptual problem [@problem_id:2470387] uses the classic scenario of a perfectly nested system along a gradient to help you distinguish between these two fundamental components of beta diversity, forcing a clear understanding of what drives compositional change.", "problem": "Three plant communities lie along a continuous elevation gradient. Community $L$ (low elevation) has richness $10$, community $M$ (mid) has richness $7$, and community $H$ (high) has richness $5$. Botanical surveys show a perfectly nested structure: the $5$ species at $H$ are a subset of the $7$ species at $M$, which in turn are a subset of the $10$ species at $L$. Using only core definitions of within-community diversity (alpha diversity), across-community pooled diversity (gamma diversity), between-community differentiation (beta diversity), and the conceptual meanings of species turnover (replacement of some species by others across communities) and nestedness (richness differences without replacement), choose the option that correctly characterizes the relative contributions of turnover and nestedness to beta diversity in this system and provides a consistent quantitative justification rooted in alpha and gamma. Your justification should be consistent with a standard, richness-explicit, compositional perspective in which beta diversity reflects how much the set of species changes among communities, and partitioning into turnover versus nestedness separates replacement from pure gains or losses along the gradient.\n\nA. Because the assemblages are perfectly nested, there is no species replacement across sites. Therefore, the turnover component is $0$ and all compositional dissimilarity arises from nestedness. With $L$ containing all species present regionally, gamma diversity is $10$, mean alpha diversity is $(10+7+5)/3=22/3$, the multiplicative Whittaker beta is $10/(22/3)=15/11$, and the additive beta is $10-22/3=8/3$; all observed pairwise and multi-site dissimilarity is thus attributable to nestedness rather than turnover.\n\nB. Along an environmental gradient, species are replaced by better-adapted taxa, so turnover must dominate over nestedness even if species lists are subsets. Hence the turnover component exceeds the nestedness component; the specific values of alpha and gamma are unnecessary for this conclusion.\n\nC. Since the communities differ in richness, both turnover and nestedness contribute equally. Taking gamma diversity as the sum across sites gives $10+7+5=22$, mean alpha is $22/3$, the multiplicative Whittaker beta is $22/(22/3)=3$, and the additive beta is $22-22/3=44/3$, split evenly between turnover and nestedness.\n\nD. Perfect nestedness implies no beta diversity because all species differences are explained by subsets. Thus, turnover and nestedness components are both $0$, and with gamma equal to the richest site ($10$) and mean alpha $(22/3)$, there is effectively no between-community differentiation to partition.", "solution": "The problem statement must first be validated for scientific correctness, consistency, and clarity before any attempt at a solution is made.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\nThe explicit information provided in the problem statement is as follows:\n- There are three plant communities, designated $L$ (low elevation), $M$ (mid-elevation), and $H$ (high elevation).\n- The communities are situated along a continuous elevation gradient.\n- The species richness (alpha diversity) for each community is: $\\alpha_L = 10$, $\\alpha_M = 7$, and $\\alpha_H = 5$.\n- The system exhibits a \"perfectly nested structure,\" meaning the species at community $H$ are a subset of the species at community $M$, and the species at community $M$ are a subset of the species at community $L$.\n- The task is to characterize the contributions of species turnover and nestedness to beta diversity, using core definitions of alpha, beta, and gamma diversity.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The concepts of alpha, beta, and gamma diversity are foundational principles in community ecology, first formalized by R.H. Whittaker. The partitioning of beta diversity into components of turnover (species replacement) and nestedness (species loss/gain resulting in subsets) is a major topic in modern macroecology and biogeography, with well-established quantitative frameworks (e.g., by Baselga). The scenario of a nested community structure along a strong environmental gradient like elevation is a classic, empirically observed pattern. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data and a clear, unambiguous condition (\"perfectly nested structure\") that allows for a unique and logical conclusion. The question is precise and asks for a characterization based on standard ecological definitions.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective and quantitative terms. There are no subjective elements or ambiguities in the definitions or data presented.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a clear and well-structured question based on established scientific principles. A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires applying the formal definitions of ecological diversity components to the specific case described.\n\n1.  **Alpha ($\\alpha$), Gamma ($\\gamma$), and Beta ($\\beta$) Diversity**:\n    - **Alpha diversity** ($\\alpha$) is the local species richness. We are given $\\alpha_L = 10$, $\\alpha_M = 7$, and $\\alpha_H = 5$.\n    - **Gamma diversity** ($\\gamma$) is the total species richness in the region, which is the richness of the pooled species from all communities. Let $S_L$, $S_M$, and $S_H$ be the sets of species in each community. Then $\\gamma = |S_L \\cup S_M \\cup S_H|$. The problem states a \"perfectly nested structure,\" which mathematically means $S_H \\subset S_M \\subset S_L$. Due to this subset relationship, the union of all sets is simply the largest set, $S_L$. Therefore, $\\gamma = |S_L| = 10$.\n    - **Mean alpha diversity** ($\\bar{\\alpha}$) is the average local richness:\n        $$ \\bar{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\alpha_L + \\alpha_M + \\alpha_H}{3} = \\frac{10 + 7 + 5}{3} = \\frac{22}{3} $$\n    - **Beta diversity** ($\\beta$) quantifies the compositional variation among communities. It can be expressed in several ways, including:\n        - Additive beta diversity: $\\beta_A = \\gamma - \\bar{\\alpha}$.\n        - Multiplicative beta diversity (Whittaker's beta): $\\beta_W = \\gamma / \\bar{\\alpha}$.\n        In this system, both measures are non-zero, indicating that community differentiation exists:\n        $$ \\beta_A = 10 - \\frac{22}{3} = \\frac{30 - 22}{3} = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n        $$ \\beta_W = \\frac{10}{22/3} = \\frac{30}{22} = \\frac{15}{11} $$\n        Since $\\beta_A > 0$ and $\\beta_W > 1$, there is measurable beta diversity.\n\n2.  **Turnover and Nestedness**:\n    - **Species turnover** (or replacement) is the component of beta diversity that arises from one species group being replaced by a different one. For turnover to occur between two sites, say site $i$ and site $j$, there must be some species present at site $i$ but not $j$, and also some species present at site $j$ but not $i$.\n    - **Nestedness** is the component of beta diversity that arises when the species of one site form a proper subset of the species of another site.\n    - In the given problem, the structure is perfectly nested ($S_H \\subset S_M \\subset S_L$). Consider any pair of communities, such as $M$ and $L$. The set of species in $M$ but not in $L$ ($S_M \\setminus S_L$) is empty, because $S_M$ is a subset of $S_L$. This is true for all pairs of communities. Because there are no species in any species-poorer community that are not also present in the more species-rich communities, there is no species replacement.\n    - By definition, the **turnover component of beta diversity is $0$**.\n    - Consequently, all of the observed beta diversity must be attributed to the nestedness component. The differences in community composition are exclusively due to species loss along the gradient, not replacement.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Because the assemblages are perfectly nested, there is no species replacement across sites. Therefore, the turnover component is $0$ and all compositional dissimilarity arises from nestedness. With $L$ containing all species present regionally, gamma diversity is $10$, mean alpha diversity is $(10+7+5)/3=22/3$, the multiplicative Whittaker beta is $10/(22/3)=15/11$, and the additive beta is $10-22/3=8/3$; all observed pairwise and multi-site dissimilarity is thus attributable to nestedness rather than turnover.**\n- This option correctly states that perfect nestedness implies zero turnover.\n- It correctly deduces that all dissimilarity must therefore arise from nestedness.\n- It correctly calculates gamma diversity ($\\gamma = 10$), mean alpha diversity ($\\bar{\\alpha} = 22/3$), multiplicative beta diversity ($\\beta_W = 15/11$), and additive beta diversity ($\\beta_A = 8/3$).\n- The final conclusion is a correct synthesis of these points.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Along an environmental gradient, species are replaced by better-adapted taxa, so turnover must dominate over nestedness even if species lists are subsets. Hence the turnover component exceeds the nestedness component; the specific values of alpha and gamma are unnecessary for this conclusion.**\n- This statement makes a generalization about environmental gradients but fails to apply the specific, critical information given in the problem: a \"perfectly nested structure\". The problem is designed as an ideal case where the general expectation of turnover does not hold. One must reason from the problem's premises, not override them with external generalizations. In this case, turnover is exactly $0$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Since the communities differ in richness, both turnover and nestedness contribute equally. Taking gamma diversity as the sum across sites gives $10+7+5=22$, mean alpha is $22/3$, the multiplicative Whittaker beta is $22/(22/3)=3$, and the additive beta is $22-22/3=44/3$, split evenly between turnover and nestedness.**\n- This option commits two major errors. First, it makes the false assertion that a difference in richness implies equal contributions from turnover and nestedness. Second, it fundamentally miscalculates gamma diversity. Gamma diversity is the total number of unique species in the pool ($\\gamma=10$), not the sum of richness values across sites. All subsequent calculations are based on this invalid premise.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Perfect nestedness implies no beta diversity because all species differences are explained by subsets. Thus, turnover and nestedness components are both $0$, and with gamma equal to the richest site ($10$) and mean alpha $(22/3)$, there is effectively no between-community differentiation to partition.**\n- This option is conceptually flawed. Beta diversity is the measure of differentiation *itself*. The fact that this differentiation is caused entirely by nestedness does not make beta diversity equal to $0$. As calculated above, $\\beta_A = 8/3$ and $\\beta_W = 15/11$, which are non-zero. The statement that both turnover and nestedness components are $0$ is false; the nestedness component is equal to the total beta diversity. The final clause that there is \"no between-community differentiation\" is a direct contradiction of the fact that $\\gamma \\neq \\bar{\\alpha}$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2470387"}, {"introduction": "While presence-absence data is useful, most ecological communities are characterized by varying species abundances, which contain vital information about community structure.

It presents a standard axiomatic derivation of a known dissimilarity index. The axioms provided are canonical for such measures. The problem statement contains no scientific or logical flaws, no ambiguity, and all information required for the derivation and subsequent calculations is provided. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nWe proceed with the solution.\n\n(a) Derivation of the dissimilarity measure $D(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})$.\n\nWe begin with the properties of additivity and replication invariance.\nThe dissimilarity has the form:\n$$D(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{S} f(x_{i},y_{i})}{N(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})}$$\nThe replication invariance condition states that for any $t>0$:\n$$D(t\\mathbf{x},t\\mathbf{y}) = D(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})$$\nSubstituting the additive form:\n$$\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{S} f(tx_{i},ty_{i})}{N(t\\mathbf{x},t\\mathbf{y})} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{S} f(x_{i},y_{i})}{N(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})}$$\nThis invariance is most naturally satisfied if the numerator and the denominator are homogeneous functions of the same degree in the abundance values. Let us assume they are homogeneous of degree $k$. The simplest and most direct choice that is consistent with the structure of ecological data (counts or densities) is homogeneity of degree $1$ ($k=1$).\nThis implies:\n1.  The single-species contribution function $f$ must be homogeneous of degree $1$: $f(tx_{i},ty_{i}) = t f(x_{i},y_{i})$.\n2.  The normalization functional $N$ must be homogeneous of degree $1$: $N(t\\mathbf{x},t\\mathbf{y}) = t N(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})$.\n\nNow we consider the properties of $f(x_{i},y_{i})$. This function quantifies the contribution of species $i$ to the total dissimilarity.\nFrom the condition $D(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x})=0$, we must have $\\sum_{i=1}^{S} f(x_{i},x_{i}) = 0$. Given that $f$ reflects discrepancy and the overall dissimilarity is non-negative, it is logical to require $f(x_{i},y_{i}) \\ge 0$. Under this non-negativity, the sum is zero if and only if each term is zero, so $f(x_{i},x_{i})=0$.\nFrom the condition that $D(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})=0 \\iff \\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{y}$, we require that $f(x_{i},y_{i})=0$ if and only if $x_{i}=y_{i}$.\nThe function $f(x_{i},y_{i})$ must also be symmetric from the overall symmetry of $D$, so $f(x_{i},y_{i}) = f(y_{i},x_{i})$.\nWe seek a continuous, symmetric, non-negative function $f(u,v)$ that is zero if and only if $u=v$, is homogeneous of degree $1$, and is monotonic in the discrepancy $|u-v|$. The simplest and most fundamental function satisfying these criteria is the absolute difference, scaled by a constant $c$:\n$$f(x_{i},y_{i}) = c |x_{i}-y_{i}|$$\nwhere $c$ is a positive constant. Checking its properties:\n-   $f(x_i,y_i) \\ge 0$, and is $0$ iff $x_i=y_i$.\n-   Symmetry: $c|x_{i}-y_{i}| = c|y_{i}-x_{i}|$.\n-   Homogeneity of degree $1$: $c|tx_{i}-ty_{i}| = c|t(x_{i}-y_{i})| = |t| c|x_{i}-y_{i}| = t c|x_{i}-y_{i}|$ for $t>0$.\n-   Continuity and monotonicity in discrepancy are evident.\n\nNow we determine the normalization functional $N(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})$. It must be positive, symmetric in $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$, and homogeneous of degree $1$. The most direct way to construct such a functional from the abundance vectors is to use the total abundance across both sites.\nLet us define $N(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})$ as the sum of all individual counts:\n$$N(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{S} (x_{i} + y_{i})$$\nThis functional is symmetric, positive for non-zero communities, and homogeneous of degree $1$:\n$$N(t\\mathbf{x},t\\mathbf{y}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{S} (tx_{i} + ty_{i}) = t \\sum_{i=1}^{S} (x_{i} + y_{i}) = t N(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})$$\nCombining these forms for $f$ and $N$, we obtain the candidate dissimilarity measure:\n$$D(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}) = \\frac{c \\sum_{i=1}^{S} |x_{i}-y_{i}|}{\\sum_{i=1}^{S} (x_{i}+y_{i})}$$\nThe final step is to use the normalization condition at complete turnover. In this case, for each species $i$, either $x_{i}=0$ or $y_{i}=0$. Therefore, for each species, $|x_{i}-y_{i}| = x_{i}+y_{i}$.\nThe numerator becomes: $c \\sum_{i=1}^{S} |x_{i}-y_{i}| = c \\sum_{i=1}^{S} (x_{i}+y_{i})$.\nThe denominator is $\\sum_{i=1}^{S} (x_{i}+y_{i})$.\nThe dissimilarity at complete turnover is:\n$$D(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}) = \\frac{c \\sum_{i=1}^{S} (x_{i}+y_{i})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{S} (x_{i}+y_{i})} = c$$\nThe problem requires this to equal $1$. Therefore, we must have $c=1$.\nThis uniquely determines the form of the dissimilarity measure as the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity:\n$$D(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{S} |x_{i}-y_{i}|}{\\sum_{i=1}^{S} (x_{i}+y_{i})}$$\nThis measure satisfies all the required axiomatic conditions.\n\n(b) Evaluation for the given data.\nThe abundance vectors are $\\mathbf{x}=(5,3,2)$ and $\\mathbf{y}=(4,4,2)$.\nWe compute the numerator, which is the sum of absolute differences in abundances for each species:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{3} |x_{i}-y_{i}| = |5-4| + |3-4| + |2-2| = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2$$\nNext, we compute the denominator, which is the sum of all abundances in both communities:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{3} (x_{i}+y_{i}) = (5+4) + (3+4) + (2+2) = 9 + 7 + 4 = 20$$\nThe value of the dissimilarity is the ratio of these two quantities:\n$$D(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}) = \\frac{2}{20} = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures as requested gives $0.1000$.\n\n(c) Presence-absence measure and interpretation.\nFirst, we convert the abundance data to presence-absence vectors. A species is present if its abundance is greater than $0$.\nFor site X, $\\mathbf{x}=(5,3,2)$, all abundances are positive. The set of present species is $P_x = \\{\\text{species } 1, \\text{species } 2, \\text{species } 3\\}$.\nFor site Y, $\\mathbf{y}=(4,4,2)$, all abundances are positive. The set of present species is $P_y = \\{\\text{species } 1, \\text{species } 2, \\text{species } 3\\}$.\nThe similarity is defined as the ratio of the number of shared species to the total number of unique species across both sites. This is the Jaccard similarity index, $S_J$.\nThe set of shared species is the intersection $P_x \\cap P_y = \\{\\text{species } 1, \\text{species } 2, \\text{species } 3\\}$. The size of the intersection is $|P_x \\cap P_y| = 3$.\nThe set of all species present in at least one site is the union $P_x \\cup P_y = \\{\\text{species } 1, \\text{species } 2, \\text{species } 3\\}$. The size of the union is $|P_x \\cup P_y| = 3$.\nThe similarity is:\n$$S_J = \\frac{|P_x \\cap P_y|}{|P_x \\cup P_y|} = \\frac{3}{3} = 1$$\nThe presence-absence distance is $D_J = 1 - S_J = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n\nInterpretation:\nThe presence-absence distance, $D_J$, is $0$. This indicates that the two communities are identical from a compositional (presence-absence) perspective. Both communities contain the exact same set of species. In this view, beta diversity, which measures compositional differentiation between sites, is zero.\nThe abundance-based distance, $D_{BC}$ (Bray-Curtis), is $0.1$. This non-zero value indicates that although the communities share the same species, their abundance structures are different. Specifically, the relative proportions of species abundances differ. Community X is dominated by species $1$ (relative abundance $5/10=0.5$), whereas community Y has a more even distribution between species $1$ and $2$ (relative abundances $4/10=0.4$ for both).\nThe alpha diversity of a site is its local diversity. The gamma diversity is the total diversity of the region. Beta diversity connects alpha and gamma diversity, representing the turnover in species composition between sites.\nThe presence-absence measure only accounts for the species turnover component of beta diversity. Since there is no turnover (all species are shared), this measure is zero.\nThe abundance-based measure is sensitive to both species turnover and differences in the abundance distributions of shared species. In this case, the non-zero value of the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity is entirely attributable to the second component: variation in the abundance structure. Therefore, the abundance-based measure provides a more detailed picture of community differentiation, capturing changes that the simpler presence-absence metric ignores.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1000}$$", "id": "2470368"}]}
