A solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the critical resource requirement, $R^{\\ast}$. This quantity is defined as the resource concentration $R$ at which the consumer population's per-capita growth rate is exactly zero. We begin by constructing an expression for the per-capita growth rate from the given principles.\n\nLet the per-capita growth rate of the consumer be denoted by $g(R)$. The problem states that this rate is the difference between per-capita assimilation and per-capita mortality.\n$$g(R) = (\\text{per-capita assimilation rate}) - (\\text{per-capita mortality rate})$$\n\nWe are given that the mortality rate per capita is a constant, $m$.\n\nNext, we formulate the per-capita assimilation rate. A Type I functional response dictates that the rate of resource encounter for a single consumer is directly proportional to the resource concentration, $R$. The constant of proportionality is the attack rate or search efficiency, $a$.\n$$\\text{Per-capita encounter rate} = aR$$\n\nAssimilation is the fraction of encountered resource that is converted into consumer biomass. This is given by the assimilation efficiency, $e$. Therefore, the per-capita assimilation rate is the product of the encounter rate and the assimilation efficiency.\n$$\\text{Per-capita assimilation rate} = e \\times (aR) = eaR$$\n\nNow, we can write the full expression for the net per-capita growth rate $g(R)$ by substituting the derived assimilation rate and the given mortality rate:\n$$g(R) = eaR - m$$\n\nThe critical resource requirement, $R^{\\ast}$, is defined as the value of $R$ for which $g(R) = 0$. This represents the break-even point where resource intake exactly balances losses, allowing the population to persist but not grow. We set the equation for $g(R)$ to zero and solve for $R = R^{\\ast}$:\n$$g(R^{\\ast}) = eaR^{\\ast} - m = 0$$\n\nTo solve for $R^{\\ast}$, we perform algebraic manipulation. First, we add $m$ to both sides of the equation:\n$$eaR^{\\ast} = m$$\n\nAssuming that both $e$ and $a$ are non-zero (which they must be for a consumer to exist), we can divide both sides by the product $ea$ to isolate $R^{\\ast}$:\n$$R^{\\ast} = \\frac{m}{ea}$$\n\nThis is the explicit closed-form expression for the critical resource requirement $R^{\\ast}$ in terms of the parameters $a$, $e$, and $m$, as required by the problem statement. This result encapsulates the fundamental trade-off for a consumer: to persist, its ability to acquire and convert resources ($e$ and $a$) must be sufficient to overcome its intrinsic losses ($m$) at a given resource level ($R^{\\ast}$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{m}{ea}}\n$$", "id": "2540102"}, {"introduction": "While the $R^*$ concept defines a static survival threshold, real populations exist in a dynamic interplay of growth, consumption, and mortality.

The term $e/h$ represents the maximum rate of biomass production by a consumer under saturated resource conditions ($e$ is the conversion efficiency and $1/h$ is the maximum ingestion rate). If the natural mortality rate $m$ exceeds this maximum possible gain, the consumer population cannot sustain itself, even with unlimited resources.

If $K \\le R^{\\ast}$, the resource population cannot grow to a high enough level to sustain the consumers because it is limited by its own density-dependent factors first. Therefore, a sufficiently high carrying capacity is a prerequisite for the consumer population to establish itself.

Let $P$ be a binary indicator variable for the predator exclusion factor, where $P=0$ corresponds to the absence of exclusion (predators present) and $P=1$ corresponds to the presence of exclusion (predators absent). Let $N$ be a binary indicator variable for the nutrient addition factor, where $N=0$ corresponds to no nutrient addition and $N=1$ corresponds to nutrient addition.\n\nThe problem asks for a linear model for the expected algal biomass, $E[Y]$, that includes an intercept, two main effects, and their interaction.

It is the change in the expected algal biomass when $P$ changes from $0$ to $1$, conditional on $N=0$. This coefficient quantifies the top-down effect of predator removal on algal biomass in the ambient nutrient condition.\n- $\\beta_N$: The main effect of nutrient addition. It is the change in the expected algal biomass when $N$ changes from $0$ to $1$, conditional on $P=0$. This coefficient quantifies the bottom-up effect of nutrient enrichment on algal biomass in the presence of predators.\n- $\\beta_{PN}$: The interaction coefficient. This term quantifies the degree to which the effect of one factor depends on the level of the other. It is the additional change in expected biomass when both manipulations are applied ($P=1, N=1$), beyond the sum of their individual effects. It measures the non-additivity of the top-down and bottom-up controls.\n\n2) Derivation of the interaction coefficient.\n\nWe begin by expressing the expected algal biomass for each of the four treatment combinations using the linear model specified above. Let $\\mu_{PN}$ denote the expected biomass for the treatment with predator exclusion level $P \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ and nutrient addition level $N \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\nFor the control treatment ($P=0, N=0$):\n$$ \\mu_{00} = E[Y | P=0, N=0] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_P(0) + \\beta_N(0) + \\beta_{PN}(0 \\cdot 0) = \\beta_0 $$\nFor the nutrient addition only treatment ($P=0, N=1$):\n$$ \\mu_{01} = E[Y | P=0, N=1] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_P(0) + \\beta_N(1) + \\beta_{PN}(0 \\cdot 1) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_N $$\nFor the predator exclusion only treatment ($P=1, N=0$):\n$$ \\mu_{10} = E[Y | P=1, N=0] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_P(1) + \\beta_N(0) + \\beta_{PN}(1 \\cdot 0) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_P $$\nFor the combined treatment with both predator exclusion and nutrient addition ($P=1, N=1$):\n$$ \\mu_{11} = E[Y | P=1, N=1] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_P(1) + \\beta_N(1) + \\beta_{PN}(1 \\cdot 1) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_P + \\beta_N + \\beta_{PN} $$\n\nTo derive an expression for $\\beta_{PN}$, we can rearrange these four equations. From the first three equations, we can express the intercept and main effects in terms of the expected means:\n$$ \\beta_0 = \\mu_{00} $$\n$$ \\beta_N = \\mu_{01} - \\beta_0 = \\mu_{01} - \\mu_{00} $$\n$$ \\beta_P = \\mu_{10} - \\beta_0 = \\mu_{10} - \\mu_{00} $$\n\nSubstituting these into the fourth equation for $\\mu_{11}$:\n$$ \\mu_{11} = (\\mu_{00}) + (\\mu_{10} - \\mu_{00}) + (\\mu_{01} - \\mu_{00}) + \\beta_{PN} $$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$ \\mu_{11} = \\mu_{10} + \\mu_{01} - \\mu_{00} + \\beta_{PN} $$\nIsolating the interaction coefficient $\\beta_{PN}$ gives the desired analytical expression:\n$$ \\beta_{PN} = \\mu_{11} - \\mu_{10} - \\mu_{01} + \\mu_{00} $$\n\nThis expression demonstrates precisely how $\\beta_{PN}$ measures non-additivity. If the effects were purely additive, the expected biomass in the combined treatment ($\\mu_{11}$) would equal the baseline biomass ($\\mu_{00}$) plus the effect of predator removal ($\\mu_{10} - \\mu_{00}$) plus the effect of nutrient addition ($\\mu_{01} - \\mu_{00}$).

The interaction coefficient $\\beta_{PN} = \\mu_{11} - (\\mu_{10} + \\mu_{01} - \\mu_{00})$ is therefore precisely the difference between the observed mean for the combined treatment and the mean predicted by a strictly additive model. A non-zero $\\beta_{PN}$ signifies a synergistic ($\\beta_{PN}>0$) or antagonistic ($\\beta_{PN}<0$) interaction.\n\nAlternatively, consider the effect of nutrient addition at each level of predator exclusion.\nThe effect of nutrients when predators are present ($P=0$) is $\\Delta N|_{P=0} = \\mu_{01} - \\mu_{00}$.\nThe effect of nutrients when predators are excluded ($P=1$) is $\\Delta N|_{P=1} = \\mu_{11} - \\mu_{10}$.\nThe interaction coefficient $\\beta_{PN}$ is the difference between these two effects:\n$$ \\beta_{PN} = (\\Delta N|_{P=1}) - (\\Delta N|_{P=0}) = (\\mu_{11} - \\mu_{10}) - (\\mu_{01} - \\mu_{00}) = \\mu_{11} - \\mu_{10} - \\mu_{01} + \\mu_{00} $$\nThis confirms that the interaction coefficient measures how the top-down control (predator exclusion) modifies the bottom-up control (nutrient effect).\n\n3) Calculation of the interaction coefficient.\n\nThe problem provides the observed treatment means, which are used as estimates for the expected values $\\mu_{PN}$.
