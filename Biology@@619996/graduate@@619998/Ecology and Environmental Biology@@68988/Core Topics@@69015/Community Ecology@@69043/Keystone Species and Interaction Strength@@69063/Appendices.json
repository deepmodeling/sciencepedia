The model, definitions, and sign-structure are canonical for a food chain.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a complete set of definitions and constraints necessary to derive a unique analytical expression for the specified matrix element and to reason about its properties.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded question in mathematical biology. A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe task is to derive an expression for the net effect of the predator on the plant, $N_{13}$, and to interpret this result. The community matrix $A$ for the specified tri-trophic chain is:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\na_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\\\\na_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\\\\na_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\na_{11} & a_{12} & 0 \\\\\na_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\\\\n0 & a_{32} & a_{33}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe net-effects matrix is defined as $N = -A^{-1}$. The element $N_{ij}$ is therefore the $(i, j)$-th element of the matrix $-A^{-1}$. We seek to find $N_{13}$.\n\nThe formula for the inverse of a matrix $A$ is given by $A^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(A)} \\text{adj}(A)$, where $\\text{adj}(A)$ is the adjugate of $A$. The $(i, j)$-th element of the inverse is given by $(A^{-1})_{ij} = \\frac{C_{ji}}{\\det(A)}$, where $C_{ji}$ is the $(j, i)$-th cofactor of $A$.\n\nFor our specific case, we require the element $(A^{-1})_{13}$:\n$$\n(A^{-1})_{13} = \\frac{C_{31}}{\\det(A)}\n$$\nThe cofactor $C_{31}$ is defined as $(-1)^{3+1}$ times the determinant of the submatrix formed by removing row $3$ and column $1$ of $A$.\n$$\nC_{31} = (-1)^{3+1} \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\na_{12} & 0 \\\\\na_{22} & a_{23}\n\\end{pmatrix} = (1)(a_{12}a_{23} - (0)(a_{22})) = a_{12}a_{23}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the determinant of $A$ using cofactor expansion along the first row:\n$$\n\\det(A) = a_{11} \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\na_{22} & a_{23} \\\\\na_{32} & a_{33}\n\\end{pmatrix} - a_{12} \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\na_{21} & a_{23} \\\\\n0 & a_{33}\n\\end{pmatrix} + 0 \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\na_{21} & a_{22} \\\\\n0 & a_{32}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\det(A) = a_{11}(a_{22}a_{33} - a_{23}a_{32}) - a_{12}(a_{21}a_{33} - 0)\n$$\n$$\n\\det(A) = a_{11}a_{22}a_{33} - a_{11}a_{23}a_{32} - a_{12}a_{21}a_{33}\n$$\nCombining these results, we find the expression for $N_{13}$:\n$$\nN_{13} = -(A^{-1})_{13} = -\\frac{C_{31}}{\\det(A)} = -\\frac{a_{12}a_{23}}{a_{11}a_{22}a_{33} - a_{11}a_{23}a_{32} - a_{12}a_{21}a_{33}}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression.\n\nNow, we must determine the sign of $N_{13}$.\nThe sign of the numerator is $-\\left(a_{12} a_{23}\\right)$.\nGiven: $a_{12} < 0$ (effect of herbivore on plant is negative) and $a_{23} < 0$ (effect of predator on herbivore is negative).\nThus, their product $a_{12}a_{23}$ is positive. The numerator, $-\\left(a_{12} a_{23}\\right)$, is therefore negative.\n\nThe sign of the denominator is the sign of $\\det(A)$. The problem states that the system has a locally stable interior equilibrium. The Jacobian matrix of the full system dynamics $\\frac{d N_i}{dt} = N_i f_i(N_1, N_2, \\dots)$ is $J_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial(N_i f_i)}{\\partial N_j} = \\delta_{ij}f_i + N_i \\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial N_j}$. At equilibrium, $f_i=0$, so the Jacobian is $J_{ij} = N_i^* a_{ij}$, where $N_i^*$ is the equilibrium abundance of species $i$. This can be written as $J = \\text{diag}(N_1^*, N_2^*, N_3^*) \\cdot A$.\nFor local stability of a continuous-time system, all eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix $J$ must have negative real parts. According to the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion for a $3 \\times 3$ system, one of the necessary conditions for stability is that the determinant of the Jacobian is negative, i.e., $\\det(J) < 0$.\nWe have $\\det(J) = \\det(\\text{diag}(N_1^*, N_2^*, N_3^*) \\cdot A) = (N_1^* N_2^* N_3^*) \\det(A)$.\nSince the equilibrium is an interior one, $N_1^* > 0$, $N_2^* > 0$, and $N_3^* > 0$. Their product is positive.\nFor $\\det(J)$ to be negative, $\\det(A)$ must also be negative.\nSo, the denominator, $\\det(A)$, is negative.\n\nThe sign of $N_{13}$ is the ratio of the sign of the numerator to the sign of the denominator:\n$$\n\\text{sign}(N_{13}) = \\frac{\\text{sign}(-a_{12}a_{23})}{\\text{sign}(\\det(A))} = \\frac{(-)}{(-)} = (+)\n$$\nTherefore, $N_{13} > 0$.\n\nFinally, we provide the ecological interpretation. $N_{13}$ represents the net change in the equilibrium abundance of the plant (species $1$) in response to a positive press perturbation on the predator (species $3$). A positive press perturbation on species $3$ means its per-capita growth rate is permanently increased. The result $N_{13} > 0$ signifies that an increase in the predator's growth leads to an increase in the plant's equilibrium abundance.\nThis occurs through an indirect interaction pathway:\n1. A positive perturbation on the predator ($3$) increases its abundance.\n2. An increased predator population exerts stronger predation pressure on the herbivore ($2$), leading to a decrease in the herbivore's abundance. This is a direct negative effect of predator on herbivore.\n3. A decreased herbivore population means reduced grazing pressure on the plant ($1$), allowing the plant population to increase. This is an indirect positive effect of the predator on the plant.\n\nThis chain of effects—where the top trophic level has a positive indirect effect on the bottom trophic level—is the definition of a top-down trophic cascade. The predator's influence cascades down the food chain, with alternating signs of impact at each trophic level. The predator benefits the plant by suppressing the intermediate herbivore. Our rigorous derivation, showing $N_{13} > 0$, provides the precise mathematical proof of this phenomenon within the given model framework.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{a_{12}a_{23}}{a_{11}a_{22}a_{33} - a_{11}a_{23}a_{32} - a_{12}a_{21}a_{33}}}\n$$", "id": "2501195"}, {"introduction": "While network structure provides valuable clues about species' roles, a high number of connections (degree) does not automatically confer keystone status.
