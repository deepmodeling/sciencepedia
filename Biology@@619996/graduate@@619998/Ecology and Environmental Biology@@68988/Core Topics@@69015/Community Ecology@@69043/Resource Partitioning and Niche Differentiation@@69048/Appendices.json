It is scientifically grounded in the principles of microbial competition theory (specifically, Monod kinetics and chemostat dynamics), is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is free of ambiguity or factual error. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe dynamics of a phytoplankton species $i$ with biomass concentration $B_i$ in a chemostat are described by the differential equation that balances growth and loss terms. The per-capita growth rate is given by the Monod function $u_i(R)$, which depends on the limiting resource concentration $R$. The losses are due to dilution from the chemostat at rate $D$ and a background mortality at rate $m_i$. The rate of change of biomass concentration is thus:\n$$\n\\frac{dB_i}{dt} = (\\text{growth rate}) B_i - (\\text{loss rate}) B_i\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dB_i}{dt} = u_i(R) B_i - (D + m_i) B_i\n$$\nFactoring out $B_i$, we obtain the net per-capita growth rate:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{B_i}\\frac{dB_i}{dt} = u_i(R) - (D + m_i)\n$$\nThe quantity $R^\\ast$ is defined as the equilibrium resource concentration at which the net per-capita growth rate is zero.

That is, $u_{\\max,i} > D + m_i$. If this condition is not met, the species will wash out regardless of resource concentration. We assume this condition holds.\n\nWe now substitute the specific form of the Monod function, $u_i(R) = u_{\\max,i} \\frac{R}{K_{s,i} + R}$, into the equilibrium condition:\n$$\nu_{\\max,i} \\frac{R_i^\\ast}{K_{s,i} + R_i^\\ast} = D + m_i\n$$\nTo derive a closed-form expression for $R_i^\\ast$, we solve this equation algebraically.\n$$\nu_{\\max,i} R_i^\\ast = (D + m_i) (K_{s,i} + R_i^\\ast)\n$$\n$$\nu_{\\max,i} R_i^\\ast = (D + m_i)K_{s,i} + (D + m_i)R_i^\\ast\n$$\n$$\nu_{\\max,i} R_i^\\ast - (D + m_i)R_i^\\ast = (D + m_i)K_{s,i}\n$$\n$$\nR_i^\\ast (u_{\\max,i} - (D + m_i)) = (D + m_i)K_{s,i}\n$$\nThis gives the general closed-form expression for $R_i^\\ast$:\n$$\nR_i^\\ast = \\frac{(D + m_i)K_{s,i}}{u_{\\max,i} - D - m_i}\n$$\nThis expression is valid provided $u_{\\max,i} > D + m_i$, which ensures a positive denominator.\n\nNext, we compute the values of $R^\\ast$ for the two species using the provided parameters: $D = 0.2$ d$^{-1}$, $m_1 = m_2 = 0.05$ d$^{-1}$.\nFor Species $1$: $u_{\\max,1} = 1.0$ d$^{-1}$, $K_{s,1} = 0.10$ mg L$^{-1}$.\nThe total loss rate is $D+m_1 = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25$ d$^{-1}$.

The superior competitor will draw down the ambient resource concentration to its own $R^\\ast$ level.

For the given ZNGIs, this equilibrium, denoted $R_{coex}^*$, occurs at the intersection of the vertical portion of one ZNGI and the horizontal portion of the other. The specific point is $(R_{1B}^*, R_{2A}^*)$.\nLet's verify this. At the point $(R_1, R_2) = (R_{1B}^*, R_{2A}^*) = (0.4, 0.4)$:\nGrowth rate of species $A$: $\\mu_A = \\min\\{v_{1A} R_1, v_{2A} R_2\\} - m_A = \\min\\{1.0 \\times 0.4, 0.5 \\times 0.4\\} - 0.2 = \\min\\{0.4, 0.2\\} - 0.2 = 0.2 - 0.2 = 0$.\nGrowth rate of species $B$: $\\mu_B = \\min\\{v_{1B} R_1, v_{2B} R_2\\} - m_B = \\min\\{0.5 \\times 0.4, 1.0 \\times 0.4\\} - 0.2 = \\min\\{0.2, 0.4\\} - 0.2 = 0.2 - 0.2 = 0$.\nBoth species have zero net growth, so the coexistence equilibrium is indeed $R_{coex}^* = (0.4, 0.4)$.\n\nFor this coexistence to be stable, each species must consume proportionally more of the resource that limits its own growth at equilibrium. At $R_{coex}^*$, species $A$ is limited by $R_2$ (since $v_{2A}R_2^* < v_{1A}R_1^*$) and species $B$ is limited by $R_1$ (since $v_{1B}R_1^* < v_{2B}R_2^*$). The geometric condition for stability compares the slopes of the consumption vectors to the slope of the line from the origin to $R_{coex}^*$.\nSlope of consumption vector $\\mathbf{q}_A = (1, 2)$ is $q_{2A}/q_{1A} = 2/1 = 2$.\nSlope of consumption vector $\\mathbf{q}_B = (2, 1)$ is $q_{2B}/q_{1B} = 1/2 = 0.5$.\nSlope of the vector to $R_{coex}^* = (0.4, 0.4)$ is $0.4/0.4 = 1$.\nThe stability condition is that the slope of the consumption vector of the $R_2$-limited species ($A$) must be greater than the slope to the equilibrium point, which must be greater than the slope of the consumption vector of the $R_1$-limited species ($B$).\nHere, we check if $q_{2A}/q_{1A} > R_{2A}^*/R_{1B}^* > q_{2B}/q_{1B}$. With our values, this is $2 > 1 > 0.5$. The condition is satisfied, so stable coexistence is possible.\n\nTask 1: The region in the supply-point plane $(S_1, S_2)$ that leads to stable coexistence is a cone defined by two rays originating from the coexistence equilibrium point $R_{coex}^*$. These rays have directions given by the consumption vectors $\\mathbf{q}_A$ and $\\mathbf{q}_B$.\nThe first invasion boundary ray corresponds to supply points $S$ that lie on the line passing through $R_{coex}^*$ in the direction of $\\mathbf{q}_A$. The equation for this ray is $S = R_{coex}^* + k \\mathbf{q}_A$ for $k > 0$. In coordinates $(S_1, S_2)$:\n$(S_1, S_2) = (0.4, 0.4) + k(1, 2) \\implies S_1 = 0.4 + k, S_2 = 0.4 + 2k$.\nEliminating $k = S_1 - 0.4$, we get the line $S_2 = 0.4 + 2(S_1 - 0.4) = 2S_1 - 0.4$.\nThe second invasion boundary ray corresponds to the direction of $\\mathbf{q}_B$: $S = R_{coex}^* + k \\mathbf{q}_B$ for $k > 0$.\n$(S_1, S_2) = (0.4, 0.4) + k(2, 1) \\implies S_1 = 0.4 + 2k, S_2 = 0.4 + k$.\nEliminating $k = S_2 - 0.4$, we get the line $S_1 = 0.4 + 2(S_2 - 0.4) = 2S_2 - 0.4$, which can be rewritten as $S_2 = \\frac{1}{2}S_1 + 0.2$.\n\nThese two rays divide the $(S_1, S_2)$ plane.\n- In the cone between these rays ($S_2 < 2S_1 - 0.4$ and $S_2 > \\frac{1}{2}S_1 + 0.2$ for large $S_1, S_2$), stable coexistence of $A$ and $B$ occurs.\n- In the region \"above\" this cone (high $S_2/S_1$ ratio, $S_2 > 2S_1 - 0.4$), resource $R_1$ is relatively more limiting. Species $A$, being the superior competitor for $R_1$, competitively excludes species $B$.\n- In the region \"below\" this cone (low $S_2/S_1$ ratio, $S_2 < \\frac{1}{2}S_1 + 0.2$), resource $R_2$ is relatively more limiting. Species $B$, being the superior competitor for $R_2$, competitively excludes species $A$.\n\nAs $S_1$ increases relative to $S_2$ along the supply line $S_1 + S_2 = C$, the supply point $S=(S_1, S_2)$ moves from a region of high $S_2/S_1$ to low $S_2/S_1$. The expected sequence of outcomes is: species $A$ wins $\\rightarrow$ stable coexistence $\\rightarrow$ species $B$ wins.\n\nTask 2: We must find the critical supply ratios $S_1/S_2$ where the supply line $S_1 + S_2 = 1.8$ intersects the two invasion boundary rays.\n\nFirst intersection (transition from A-wins to coexistence):\nWe solve the system:\n$$S_1 + S_2 = 1.8$$\n$$S_2 = 2S_1 - 0.4$$\nSubstituting the second equation into the first:\n$S_1 + (2S_1 - 0.4) = 1.8$\n$3S_1 = 2.2$\n$S_1 = \\frac{2.2}{3} = \\frac{22}{30} = \\frac{11}{15}$\nThen $S_2 = 1.8 - S_1 = \\frac{18}{10} - \\frac{11}{15} = \\frac{9}{5} - \\frac{11}{15} = \\frac{27 - 11}{15} = \\frac{16}{15}$.\nThe lower critical ratio is $r_{\\mathrm{low}} = \\frac{S_1}{S_2} = \\frac{11/15}{16/15} = \\frac{11}{16}$.\n\nSecond intersection (transition from coexistence to B-wins):\nWe solve the system:\n$$S_1 + S_2 = 1.8$$\n$$S_2 = \\frac{1}{2}S_1 + 0.2$$\nSubstituting the second equation into the first:\n$S_1 + (\\frac{1}{2}S_1 + 0.2) = 1.8$\n$\\frac{3}{2}S_1 = 1.6$\n$S_1 = 1.6 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{16}{10} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{32}{30} = \\frac{16}{15}$\nThen $S_2 = 1.8 - S_1 = \\frac{18}{10} - \\frac{16}{15} = \\frac{9}{5} - \\frac{16}{15} = \\frac{27 - 16}{15} = \\frac{11}{15}$.\nThe higher critical ratio is $r_{\\mathrm{high}} = \\frac{S_1}{S_2} = \\frac{16/15}{11/15} = \\frac{16}{11}$.\n\nThe two critical supply-ratio values are $11/16$ and $16/11$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{11}{16} & \\frac{16}{11}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2528748"}]}
