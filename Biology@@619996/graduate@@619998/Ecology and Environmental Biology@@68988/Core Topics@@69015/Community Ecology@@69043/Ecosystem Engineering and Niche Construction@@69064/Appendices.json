We are given the fitness function for a mutant with trait $z$ in an environment $E$:\n$$\nw(z,E) = a z - b z^{2} + c E\n$$\nand the environmental response function, which links the environment to the resident trait value, here also denoted $z$:\n$$\nE(z) = d z\n$$\nThe constants $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are real, with the constraint $b > 0$.

This solution violates both main constraints: $2(5) + 4 + 3 = 17 > 6$ and $5 + 2(4) + 3 = 16 > 5$. Thus, at least one of these constraints must be active.\n\nLet's test the case where both major constraints are active, which means $2x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 6$ and $x_1 + 2x_2 + x_3 = 5$. By complementary slackness, this implies we can have $\\lambda_1 > 0$ and $\\lambda_2 > 0$.\nSubstitute the expressions for $x_i$ into the two binding constraint equations:\nFor $2x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 6$:\n$$\n2(5 - \\lambda_1 - \\frac{\\lambda_2}{2}) + (4 - \\frac{\\lambda_1}{2} - \\lambda_2) + (3 - \\frac{\\lambda_1}{2} - \\frac{\\lambda_2}{2}) = 6\n$$\n$$\n(10 - 2\\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2) + (4 - \\frac{\\lambda_1}{2} - \\lambda_2) + (3 - \\frac{\\lambda_1}{2} - \\frac{\\lambda_2}{2}) = 6\n$$\n$$\n17 - (2 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2})\\lambda_1 - (1 + 1 + \\frac{1}{2})\\lambda_2 = 6\n$$\n$$\n17 - 3\\lambda_1 - \\frac{5}{2}\\lambda_2 = 6 \\implies 3\\lambda_1 + \\frac{5}{2}\\lambda_2 = 11 \\implies 6\\lambda_1 + 5\\lambda_2 = 22 \\quad (1)\n$$\nFor $x_1 + 2x_2 + x_3 = 5$:\n$$\n(5 - \\lambda_1 - \\frac{\\lambda_2}{2}) + 2(4 - \\frac{\\lambda_1}{2} - \\lambda_2) + (3 - \\frac{\\lambda_1}{2} - \\frac{\\lambda_2}{2}) = 5\n$$\n$$\n(5 - \\lambda_1 - \\frac{\\lambda_2}{2}) + (8 - \\lambda_1 - 2\\lambda_2) + (3 - \\frac{\\lambda_1}{2} - \\frac{\\lambda_2}{2}) = 5\n$$\n$$\n16 - (1 + 1 + \\frac{1}{2})\\lambda_1 - (\\frac{1}{2} + 2 + \\frac{1}{2})\\lambda_2 = 5\n$$\n$$\n16 - \\frac{5}{2}\\lambda_1 - 3\\lambda_2 = 5 \\implies \\frac{5}{2}\\lambda_1 + 3\\lambda_2 = 11 \\implies 5\\lambda_1 + 6\\lambda_2 = 22 \\quad (2)\n$$\nWe now solve the linear system for $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n6\\lambda_1 + 5\\lambda_2 &= 22 \\\\\n5\\lambda_1 + 6\\lambda_2 &= 22\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nMultiplying the first equation by $5$ and the second by $6$:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n30\\lambda_1 + 25\\lambda_2 &= 110 \\\\\n30\\lambda_1 + 36\\lambda_2 &= 132\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nSubtracting the first new equation from the second gives $11\\lambda_2 = 22$, which yields $\\lambda_2 = 2$.\nSubstituting $\\lambda_2 = 2$ into the first original equation: $6\\lambda_1 + 5(2) = 22 \\implies 6\\lambda_1 = 12 \\implies \\lambda_1 = 2$.\nBoth multipliers are positive ($\\lambda_1=2 > 0, \\lambda_2=2 > 0$), which is consistent with the assumption that both constraints are binding.\n\nNow we find the optimal allocation vector $x^\\star = (x_1^\\star, x_2^\\star, x_3^\\star)$ using these multiplier values:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx_1^\\star &= 5 - \\lambda_1 - \\frac{\\lambda_2}{2} = 5 - 2 - \\frac{2}{2} = 2 \\\\\nx_2^\\star &= 4 - \\frac{\\lambda_1}{2} - \\lambda_2 = 4 - \\frac{2}{2} - 2 = 1 \\\\\nx_3^\\star &= 3 - \\frac{\\lambda_1}{2} - \\frac{\\lambda_2}{2} = 3 - \\frac{2}{2} - \\frac{2}{2} = 1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe candidate solution is $x^\\star = (2, 1, 1)$. We verify that this solution satisfies all KKT conditions.\n$1$. Stationarity: Satisfied by construction.\n$2$. Primal Feasibility:\n$x_1=2 \\geq 0$, $x_2=1 \\geq 0$, $x_3=1 \\geq 0$. Non-negativity holds.\n$2x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 2(2) + 1 + 1 = 6 \\leq 6$. Holds.\n$x_1 + 2x_2 + x_3 = 2 + 2(1) + 1 = 5 \\leq 5$. Holds.\n$3$. Dual Feasibility: $\\lambda_1 = 2 \\geq 0$, $\\lambda_2 = 2 \\geq 0$. We assumed $x_i > 0$, so $\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\mu_3 = 0$, which are also non-negative. Holds.\n$4$. Complementary Slackness:\n$\\lambda_1(2x_1+x_2+x_3-6) = 2(6-6) = 0$. Holds, since $\\lambda_1 > 0$ and the constraint is binding.\n$\\lambda_2(x_1+2x_2+x_3-5) = 2(5-5) = 0$. Holds, since $\\lambda_2 > 0$ and the constraint is binding.\n$\\mu_i x_i = 0 \\cdot x_i = 0$. Holds, since $\\mu_i=0$.\n\nSince all KKT conditions are satisfied, and the problem is a convex optimization problem, the solution $x^\\star = (2, 1, 1)$ is the unique global maximum. The optimal allocation is $x_1^\\star = 2$, $x_2^\\star = 1$, and $x_3^\\star = 1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2484739"}]}
