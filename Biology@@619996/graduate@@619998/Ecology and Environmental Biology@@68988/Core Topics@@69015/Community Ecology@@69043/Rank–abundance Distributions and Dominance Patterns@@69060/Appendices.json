A complete solution will be provided.\n\nWe proceed with the derivation. The problem states that the abundance $n_r$ is determined by a sequential resource preemption process. Let the total resource pool be proportional to the total abundance parameter $N$. We can set the total resource equal to $N$ without loss of generality.\n\nFirst, we derive the expected abundance $n_r$.\nThe most abundant species (rank $r=1$) preempts a fraction $k$ of the total resource $N$. Its abundance is:\n$$ n_1 = k N $$\nThe resource remaining after the first species is $N - k N = N(1-k)$.\nThe second-most abundant species (rank $r=2$) preempts a fraction $k$ of the *remaining* resource. Its abundance is:\n$$ n_2 = k [N(1-k)] = N k (1-k)^1 $$\nThe resource remaining after the second species is $N(1-k) - N k (1-k) = N(1-k)(1-k) = N(1-k)^2$.\nBy induction, the resource available to the $r$-th species is $N(1-k)^{r-1}$. The $r$-th species preempts a fraction $k$ of this amount. Thus, the abundance of the species of rank $r$ is:\n$$ n_r = k [N(1-k)^{r-1}] = N k (1-k)^{r-1} $$\nThis expression provides the expected abundance $n_r$ as a function of $N$, $k$, and $r$.\n\nSecond, we analyze the log-abundance–rank relationship. We take the natural logarithm of the expression for $n_r$:\n$$ \\ln(n_r) = \\ln(N k (1-k)^{r-1}) $$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we expand this expression:\n$$ \\ln(n_r) = \\ln(N) + \\ln(k) + \\ln((1-k)^{r-1}) $$\n$$ \\ln(n_r) = \\ln(N) + \\ln(k) + (r-1)\\ln(1-k) $$\nTo identify the slope with respect to rank $r$, we rearrange the equation into the form of a linear function of $r$, $y = c_0 + c_1 r$:\n$$ \\ln(n_r) = [\\ln(N) + \\ln(k) - \\ln(1-k)] + r \\ln(1-k) $$\nThis is a linear relationship between $\\ln(n_r)$ and $r$. The exact slope of this relationship is the coefficient of $r$, which is:\n$$ \\text{Slope} = \\ln(1-k) $$\nSince $0 < k < 1$, it follows that $0 < 1-k < 1$, and therefore the slope $\\ln(1-k)$ is negative, as expected for a rank-abundance curve where abundance decreases with rank.\n\nFinally, we derive the estimator $\\hat{k}$ from the OLS fitted slope $b$.\nAn ecologist performs a linear regression of $\\ln(n_r)$ (the dependent variable) on $r$ (the independent variable) for the top $m$ ranks, where $r=1, 2, \\dots, m$. The model being fitted is $\\ln(n_r) = \\alpha + \\beta r$.\nThe theoretical relationship derived above, $\\ln(n_r) = [\\ln(Nk) - \\ln(1-k)] + r \\ln(1-k)$, shows that the data points $(r, \\ln(n_r))$ lie perfectly on a straight line. In this deterministic case, where there is no statistical error, the slope $b$ estimated by ordinary least squares will be exactly equal to the true slope of the line, $\\beta$.\nTherefore, we can equate the empirically obtained slope $b$ with the theoretical slope:\n$$ b = \\ln(1-k) $$\nThe problem asks for an estimator for $k$, denoted $\\hat{k}$, in terms of $b$. To find this, we must solve the above equation for $k$. We do this by exponentiating both sides with base $e$:\n$$ \\exp(b) = \\exp(\\ln(1-k)) $$\n$$ \\exp(b) = 1-k $$\nSolving for $k$ gives:\n$$ k = 1 - \\exp(b) $$\nSince $b$ is an estimate of the true slope, the resulting $k$ is an estimator, $\\hat{k}$. Thus, the closed-form expression for the estimator is:\n$$ \\hat{k} = 1 - \\exp(b) $$\nThis expression depends only on the fitted slope $b$, as required.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1 - \\exp(b)} $$", "id": "2527337"}, {"introduction": "While summary statistics like the Shannon entropy ($H'$) are invaluable for comparing overall community diversity, they can sometimes obscure important differences in structure.

The extremeness criterion is based on the Berger-Parker index, which simplifies to comparing the maximum abundance in a composition to $k_{\\text{obs}}$.\n$$ p_{\\text{high}} = \\frac{\\sum_{\\mathbf{n} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{N,S} \\text{ where } \\max_i n_i \\ge k_{\\text{obs}}} w(\\mathbf{n})}{\\sum_{\\mathbf{n} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{N,S}} w(\\mathbf{n})} $$\nwhere $\\mathcal{C}_{N,S}$ denotes the set of all ordered compositions of $N$ into $S$ positive parts.\n\nThe solution is implemented via the following algorithm:\n$1$. **Enumerate Compositions**: A recursive generator function is constructed to enumerate all ordered compositions of $N$ into $S$ positive parts. The number of such compositions is $\\binom{N-1}{S-1}$, which is computationally manageable for the given test cases.\n\n$2$. **Calculate Weights**: For each generated composition $\\mathbf{n} = (n_1, \\ldots, n_S)$, we compute its weight. Direct computation of factorials can lead to numerical overflow or underflow. A more robust method is to work with logarithms. The logarithm of the unnormalized weight is $\\ln(w(\\mathbf{n})) = -\\sum_{i=1}^S \\ln(n_i!)$. The log-factorial, $\\ln(k!)$, is computed efficiently and accurately using the log-gamma function, `gammaln`, from the `scipy.special` library, as $\\ln(k!) = \\text{gammaln}(k+1)$. The weight is then $w(\\mathbf{n}) = \\exp\\left(-\\sum_{i=1}^S \\text{gammaln}(n_i+1)\\right)$. For efficiency, values of $\\ln(k!)$ are pre-computed and stored.\n\n$3$. **Compute the p-value**: We iterate through all generated compositions. Two sums are maintained: $W_{\\text{total}}$, the sum of weights of all compositions, and $W_{\\text{extreme}}$, the sum of weights only for those compositions where $\\max_i n_i \\ge k_{\\text{obs}}$. The final $p$-value is the ratio $W_{\\text{extreme}} / W_{\\text{total}}$. This process is repeated for each of the test vectors provided. Finally, the resulting $p$-values are rounded to $6$ decimal places as required.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import gammaln\n\ndef generate_compositions(n, s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all ordered compositions of integer n into s positive integer parts.\n    This is implemented as a recursive generator.\n    \"\"\"\n    if s == 1:\n        if n > 0:\n            yield [n]\n        return\n\n    # To form a composition of n into s parts, we choose the first part, k.\n    # k must be at least 1.\n    # The remaining n-k must be composed into s-1 parts, each at least 1.\n    # This requires n-k >= s-1, which implies k <= n - s + 1.\n    # The range's endpoint is exclusive, so it must be n - s + 2.\n    for k in range(1, n - s + 2):\n        for sub_composition in generate_compositions(n - k, s - 1):\n            yield [k] + sub_composition\n\ndef calculate_p_value(a, log_fact_vals):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the one-sided p-value for the Berger-Parker dominance.\n    \"\"\"\n    S = len(a)\n    N = sum(a)\n    k_obs = max(a)\n\n    total_weight = 0.0\n    extreme_weight = 0.0\n\n    compositions_generator = generate_compositions(N, S)\n\n    for comp in compositions_generator:\n        # Calculate log of the product of factorials\n        log_prod_factorials = sum(log_fact_vals[val] for val in comp)\n        \n        # The weight is proportional to 1 / product(n_i!)\n        weight = np.exp(-log_prod_factorials)\n        \n        total_weight += weight\n        \n        if max(comp) >= k_obs:\n            extreme_weight += weight\n            \n    # If total_weight is zero, means there were no valid compositions.\n    # This won't happen if N >= S, which holds for the given problem context.\n    # If it were to happen, the interpretation depends on k_obs.\n    if total_weight == 0:\n        return 0.0\n\n    p_value = extreme_weight / total_weight\n    return p_value\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the problem for the given test suite.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        [5, 3, 2, 1, 1],             # N=12, S=5, k_obs=5\n        [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], # N=10, S=10, k_obs=1\n        [9, 2, 2, 1, 1],             # N=15, S=5, k_obs=9\n        [6, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1]    # N=20, S=8, k_obs=6\n    ]\n\n    # Find the maximum N required across all test cases to pre-compute log factorials.\n    max_N = 0\n    if test_cases:\n        max_N = max(sum(case) for case in test_cases)\n\n    # Pre-compute log(k!) for k from 0 to max_N for efficiency.\n    # log_fact_vals[k] will store log(k!).\n    # log(k!) = gammaln(k + 1).\n    log_fact_vals = gammaln(np.arange(max_N + 1) + 1)\n    \n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        p_val = calculate_p_value(case, log_fact_vals)\n        # Format the result to six decimal places.\n        results.append(f\"{p_val:.6f}\")\n\n    # Print the final output in the specified format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2527343"}]}
