Given the growth law, this is equivalent to $\\min\\{\\mu_{j1}(R^{\\text{eq}}_{i,1}), \\mu_{j2}(R^{\\text{eq}}_{i,2})\\}  m_j$. This inequality holds if and only if both $\\mu_{j1}(R^{\\text{eq}}_{i,1})  m_j$ and $\\mu_{j2}(R^{\\text{eq}}_{i,2})  m_j$. Since the functions $\\mu_{ij}$ are strictly increasing, these are equivalent to $R^{\\text{eq}}_{i,1}  R^{*}_{j1}$ and $R^{\\text{eq}}_{i,2}  R^{*}_{j2}$.\n\nFirst, let us analyze the case of species $2$ invading species $1$'s equilibrium. For this, we must determine $\\mathbf{R}^{\\text{eq}}_1$.\nThe ZNGI for species $1$ is the L-shaped boundary defined by the lines $R_1 = R^{*}_{11} = 0.25$ and $R_2 = R^{*}_{12} = 0.50$. The equilibrium resource state $\\mathbf{R}^{\\text{eq}}_1$ is the first point on the resource depletion ray that intersects this ZNGI. The ray starts at $\\mathbf{S}=(1.0, 1.0)$ and moves along the direction $-\\mathbf{c}_1 = (-0.2, -0.8)$.\nThe equation of the ray is $\\mathbf{R}(q) = (1.0 - 0.2q, 1.0 - 0.8q)$ for $q \\geq 0$.\nWe find the value of the parameter $q$ at which the ray intersects each of the two lines of the ZNGI:\n- Intersection with $R_1 = 0.25$: $1.0 - 0.2q = 0.25 \\implies 0.2q = 0.75 \\implies q_1 = \\frac{0.75}{0.2} = 3.75$.\n- Intersection with $R_2 = 0.50$: $1.0 - 0.8q = 0.50 \\implies 0.8q = 0.50 \\implies q_2 = \\frac{0.50}{0.8} = 0.625$.\nThe first intersection occurs at the smaller non-negative $q$, which is $q = q_2 = 0.625$. At this value of $q$, the resource levels are:\n$R_1 = 1.0 - 0.2(0.625) = 1.0 - 0.125 = 0.875$.\n$R_2 = 1.0 - 0.8(0.625) = 1.0 - 0.5 = 0.50$.\nSo, $\\mathbf{R}^{\\text{eq}}_1 = (0.875, 0.50)$. At this point, $R_1 = 0.875  R^{*}_{11} = 0.25$, which confirms it is on the correct portion of the ZNGI. Species $1$ is limited by resource $2$.\n\nNow, we check if species $2$ can invade at $\\mathbf{R}^{\\text{eq}}_1 = (0.875, 0.50)$. The conditions are:\n1. $R^{\\text{eq}}_{1,1}  R^{*}_{21} \\implies 0.875  0.60$. This is true.\n2. $R^{\\text{eq}}_{1,2}  R^{*}_{22} \\implies 0.50  0.20$. This is also true.\nSince both conditions are met, species $2$ can invade the equilibrium of species $1$. Therefore, the variable $x_2$ in the final answer is $1$.\n\nNext, let us analyze the case of species $1$ invading species $2$'s equilibrium. We must determine $\\mathbf{R}^{\\text{eq}}_2$.\nThe ZNGI for species $2$ is defined by $R_1 = R^{*}_{21} = 0.60$ and $R_2 = R^{*}_{22} = 0.20$. The depletion ray starts at $\\mathbf{S}=(1.0, 1.0)$ and moves along $-\\mathbf{c}_2 = (-0.9, -0.3)$.\nThe equation of the ray is $\\mathbf{R}(q) = (1.0 - 0.9q, 1.0 - 0.3q)$ for $q \\geq 0$.\nWe find the value of $q$ for intersection with the ZNGI lines:\n- Intersection with $R_1 = 0.60$: $1.0 - 0.9q = 0.60 \\implies 0.9q = 0.40 \\implies q_1 = \\frac{0.4}{0.9} = \\frac{4}{9}$.\n- Intersection with $R_2 = 0.20$: $1.0 - 0.3q = 0.80 \\implies 0.3q = 0.80 \\implies q_2 = \\frac{0.8}{0.3} = \\frac{8}{3}$.\nThe first intersection occurs at the smaller $q$, which is $q = q_1 = \\frac{4}{9}$. At this $q$, the resource levels are:\n$R_1 = 1.0 - 0.9(\\frac{4}{9}) = 1.0 - 0.4 = 0.60$.\n$R_2 = 1.0 - 0.3(\\frac{4}{9}) = 1.0 - \\frac{1.2}{9} = 1.0 - \\frac{12}{90} = 1.0 - \\frac{2}{15} = \\frac{13}{15}$.\nSo, $\\mathbf{R}^{\\text{eq}}_2 = (0.60, \\frac{13}{15})$. At this point, $R_2 = \\frac{13}{15} \\approx 0.867  R^{*}_{22} = 0.20$, confirming it's on the correct part of the ZNGI. Species $2$ is limited by resource $1$.\n\nNow, we check if species $1$ can invade at $\\mathbf{R}^{\\text{eq}}_2 = (0.60, \\frac{13}{15})$. The conditions are:\n1. $R^{\\text{eq}}_{2,1}  R^{*}_{11} \\implies 0.60  0.25$. This is true.\n2. $R^{\\text{eq}}_{2,2}  R^{*}_{12} \\implies \\frac{13}{15}  0.50$. Since $0.50 = \\frac{7.5}{15}$, the inequality $\\frac{13}{15}  \\frac{7.5}{15}$ is true.\nSince both conditions are met, species $1$ can invade the equilibrium of species $2$. Therefore, the variable $x_1$ in the final answer is $1$.\n\nIn summary, species $1$ can invade species $2$'s equilibrium ($x_1=1$) and species $2$ can invade species $1$'s equilibrium ($x_2=1$). This situation is known as mutual invasibility and leads to stable coexistence.\n\nThe final answer is to be reported as a $1 \\times 2$ row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} x_1  x_2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nWith $x_1=1$ and $x_2=1$, the matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1  1 \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1  1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2499454"}]}
