The problem states that per capita competitive impact is a monotonically increasing function of $O(z_1, z_2)$. Under frequency-dependent selection arising from interspecific competition, natural selection will favor individuals whose traits minimize this competitive pressure. To minimize $O(z_1, z_2)$, the argument of the exponential function, which is negative, must be made as large as possible in magnitude. This requires maximizing the term $\\frac{(z_1-z_2)^2}{4\\omega^2}$. For a fixed niche breadth $\\omega$, this is achieved by maximizing the trait separation, $|z_1-z_2|$. The evolutionary process by which interspecific competition drives the traits of competing species to become more different is known as **character displacement**. The resulting increase in $|z_1-z_2|$ is **trait divergence**. Therefore, the evolutionary minimization of the overlap integral $O$ directly corresponds to the process of character displacement.\n\nThe niche breadth, $\\omega$, plays a critical role as a scaling parameter. The argument of the exponential, $-\\left(\\frac{|z_1-z_2|}{2\\omega}\\right)^2$, reveals that the competitive overlap is not a function of the absolute trait separation $|z_1-z_2|$, but of this separation scaled by the niche breadth.\n$1$. $\\omega$ defines the characteristic scale or \"spatial extent\" of competitive interaction in trait space. Significant competition, and therefore significant selective pressure for divergence, occurs when $|z_1-z_2|$ is on the order of $\\omega$. If $|z_1-z_2| \\gg 2\\omega$, the overlap becomes negligible, and the selective pressure vanishes.\n$2$. $\\omega$ modulates the strength of competition. The pre-factor $1/(2\\omega\\sqrt{\\pi})$ shows that for completely overlapping niches ($z_1=z_2$), competition is stronger for species with narrower niches (smaller $\\omega$), as their resource use is more concentrated. Conversely, the exponential term shows that for a fixed separation $|z_1-z_2|$, a larger $\\omega$ leads to a more gradual decrease in overlap. This means that generalist species (large $\\omega$) compete less intensely but over a wider range of niche separations compared to specialist species (small $\\omega$), which compete intensely but only when their niches are very similar. Thus, $\\omega$ scales both the strength and the extent of competition in trait space, fundamentally shaping the dynamics of character displacement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2\\omega\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(z_{1}-z_{2})^{2}}{4\\omega^{2}}\\right)}$$", "id": "2475761"}, {"introduction": "Character displacement is not merely an evolutionary response; it has profound consequences for the assembly and stability of ecological communities.
