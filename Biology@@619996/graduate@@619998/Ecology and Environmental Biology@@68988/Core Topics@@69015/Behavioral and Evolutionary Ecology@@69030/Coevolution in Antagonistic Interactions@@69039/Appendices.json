The inclusion of symmetric, non-differential costs ($c_{H}$ and $c_{P}$) is a valid modeling choice, often used to test the understanding that such costs do not influence the internal equilibrium frequencies under negative frequency-dependent selection, even though they affect mean population fitness.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full derivation of the solution will now be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Equilibrium Frequencies**\n\nWe are tasked with finding the internal equilibrium frequencies, $p^{\\ast}$ and $q^{\\ast}$, where $0  p^{\\ast}  1$ and $0  q^{\\ast}  1$. An internal equilibrium exists when the allele frequencies within each population cease to change from one generation to the next. For a haploid system, this occurs when the marginal fitnesses of all segregating alleles within a population are equal.\n\nFirst, we define the marginal fitness for each allele based on the provided rules. Let the baseline fitness for both host and parasite be $1$. Fitness is constructed as \"baseline fitness plus gains minus losses\".\n\n**Host Fitness ($W_{H}$)**\nThe fitness of a host allele is the baseline fitness ($1$) reduced by the symmetric cost $c_H$ and the expected fitness loss due to infection. The probability of infection for a given host type is the frequency of its matching parasite type.\n-   The marginal fitness of the host allele $H_{A}$ is:\n    $$W_{H_{A}} = 1 - c_{H} - s \\cdot q$$\n    Here, $q$ is the frequency of the matching parasite $P_{A}$, and $s$ is the fitness loss upon infection.\n-   The marginal fitness of the host allele $H_{B}$ is:\n    $$W_{H_{B}} = 1 - c_{H} - s \\cdot (1-q)$$\n    Here, $1-q$ is the frequency of the matching parasite $P_{B}$.\n\nFor a stable polymorphic equilibrium in the host population, the fitnesses of the two alleles must be equal: $W_{H_{A}} = W_{H_{B}}$.\n$$1 - c_{H} - s q^{\\ast} = 1 - c_{H} - s(1 - q^{\\ast})$$\nThe terms $1 - c_{H}$ cancel from both sides.\n$$-s q^{\\ast} = -s(1 - q^{\\ast})$$\nGiven that $s > 0$, we can divide both sides by $-s$:\n$$q^{\\ast} = 1 - q^{\\ast}$$\n$$2q^{\\ast} = 1$$\n$$q^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThis is the parasite allele frequency required to maintain polymorphism in the host population.\n\n**Parasite Fitness ($W_{P}$)**\nThe fitness of a parasite allele is the baseline fitness ($1$) reduced by the symmetric cost $c_P$ and increased by the expected fitness gain from infection. The probability of a successful infection for a given parasite type is the frequency of its matching host type.\n-   The marginal fitness of the parasite allele $P_{A}$ is:\n    $$W_{P_{A}} = 1 - c_{P} + b \\cdot p$$\n    Here, $p$ is the frequency of the matching host $H_{A}$, and $b$ is the fitness gain upon infection.\n-   The marginal fitness of the parasite allele $P_{B}$ is:\n    $$W_{P_{B}} = 1 - c_{P} + b \\cdot (1-p)$$\n    Here, $1-p$ is the frequency of the matching host $H_{B}$.\n\nFor a stable polymorphic equilibrium in the parasite population, the fitnesses of the two alleles must be equal: $W_{P_{A}} = W_{P_{B}}$.\n$$1 - c_{P} + b p^{\\ast} = 1 - c_{P} + b(1 - p^{\\ast})$$\nThe terms $1 - c_{P}$ cancel from both sides.\n$$b p^{\\ast} = b(1 - p^{\\ast})$$\nGiven that $b > 0$, we can divide both sides by $b$:\n$$p^{\\ast} = 1 - p^{\\ast}$$\n$$2p^{\\ast} = 1$$\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThis is the host allele frequency required to maintain polymorphism in the parasite population.\n\nThe internal equilibrium point $(p^{\\ast}, q^{\\ast})$, where both populations maintain polymorphism, is therefore $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$. The symmetric costs $c_{H}$ and $c_{P}$ do not influence the location of this equilibrium point, as they affect the fitness of both alleles within a species equally and thus do not generate differential selection. This dynamic, where the fitness of an allele is inversely proportional to its frequency (negative frequency-dependent selection), robustly drives the system to this central equilibrium point.\nThe final answer is to be expressed as a $1 \\times 2$ row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{2}  \\frac{1}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2476603"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the concept of specific genetic interactions, this practice introduces the crucial role of costs and the powerful technique of invasion analysis.

Hosts carry a resistance allele at frequency $p$ such that a fraction $p$ of host individuals are resistant and a fraction $1 - p$ are susceptible. Assume random mixing and demographic stationarity at the ecological time scale so that host class frequencies seen by a rare parasite are proportional to their demographic weights.\n\nBaseline infection success of a parasite on a compatible host is normalized to $1$. Avirulent parasites fail to infect resistant hosts (infection success $0$ on resistant hosts), whereas virulent parasites can infect both host classes but pay a direct, multiplicative life-history cost of virulence $c_v \\in (0,1)$ that scales their infection success by a factor $(1 - c_v)$ on all host classes. Hosts bearing the resistance allele pay a constitutive cost $c_R \\in (0,1)$ that reduces their demographic weight (and hence encounter availability) by a multiplicative factor $(1 - c_R)$. Consequently, from the perspective of a rare parasite, the effective encounter weights with susceptible and resistant hosts are proportional to $(1 - p)$ and $(1 - c_R)\\,p$, respectively. Assume a separation of time scales: the host allele frequency $p$ and costs $c_v$, $c_R$ are constant across the invasion episode of the virulence allele.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions of invasion analysis (a rare mutant invades if its per capita reproductive success when rare exceeds that of the resident type in the resident environment) and the assumptions above, derive the critical resistance allele frequency $p^\\ast$ such that a rare virulence allele can invade if and only if $p > p^\\ast$.

Do not provide an inequality or an equation. No numerical rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, based on the established principles of invasion analysis in evolutionary ecology. We will proceed to derive the critical resistance frequency, $p^{\\ast}$.\n\nThe core principle of invasion analysis states that a rare mutant allele can invade a resident population if the per capita reproductive success of the mutant, when rare, is greater than the per capita reproductive success of the resident in the same environment. Let $W$ represent this measure of fitness. The condition for invasion of a rare virulent parasite is $W_{vir} > W_{avir}$, where $W_{vir}$ is the fitness of the virulent mutant and $W_{avir}$ is the fitness of the avirulent resident.\n\nThe environment is defined by the host population. Hosts with the resistance allele are present at frequency $p$, and susceptible hosts are at frequency $1-p$. A cost of resistance, $c_R$, reduces the demographic weight of resistant hosts by a factor $1-c_R$. Consequently, the effective encounter weights for a parasite are proportional to $(1-p)$ for susceptible hosts and $(1-c_R)p$ for resistant hosts.\n\nTo calculate the per capita reproductive success, we consider the weighted average of infection outcomes across both host types. The total demographic weight of the host population available for encounter is proportional to $K = (1-p) + (1-c_R)p$. Therefore, the probability of a parasite encountering a susceptible host is $P_{S} = \\frac{1-p}{K}$, and the probability of encountering a resistant host is $P_{R} = \\frac{(1-c_R)p}{K}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the fitness of the resident avirulent parasite, $W_{avir}$. An avirulent parasite has an infection success of $1$ on susceptible hosts and $0$ on resistant hosts. Its fitness is the sum of outcomes weighted by encounter probabilities:\n$$\nW_{avir} = (1) \\cdot P_{S} + (0) \\cdot P_{R} = \\frac{1-p}{(1-p) + (1-c_R)p}\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the fitness of the rare virulent mutant, $W_{vir}$. This parasite can infect both host types, but its infection success is reduced by a multiplicative cost of virulence, $c_v$. The success rate is thus $(1-c_v)$ on both host types. Its fitness is:\n$$\nW_{vir} = (1 - c_v) \\cdot P_{S} + (1 - c_v) \\cdot P_{R} = (1 - c_v) (P_{S} + P_{R})\n$$\nSince $P_{S} + P_{R} = 1$, the fitness of the virulent parasite simplifies to:\n$$\nW_{vir} = 1 - c_v\n$$\n\nThe invasion condition is $W_{vir} > W_{avir}$. Substituting the expressions for fitness, we obtain the inequality:\n$$\n1 - c_v > \\frac{1-p}{(1 - p) + (1 - c_R)p}\n$$\nThe denominator can be simplified: $(1 - p) + (1 - c_R)p = 1 - p + p - c_R p = 1 - c_R p$. The inequality becomes:\n$$\n1 - c_v > \\frac{1-p}{1 - c_R p}\n$$\nGiven that $c_R \\in (0,1)$ and $p \\in [0,1]$, the denominator $1 - c_R p$ is strictly positive. We can therefore multiply both sides by $1 - c_R p$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$\n(1 - c_v)(1 - c_R p) > 1 - p\n$$\nExpanding the left side gives:\n$$\n1 - c_R p - c_v + c_v c_R p > 1 - p\n$$\nWe rearrange the terms to solve for $p$. We move all terms containing $p$ to the left side and constant terms to the right side:\n$$\np - c_R p + c_v c_R p > 1 - (1 - c_v)\n$$\n$$\np - c_R p + c_v c_R p > c_v\n$$\nFactoring out $p$:\n$$\np(1 - c_R + c_v c_R) > c_v\n$$\nLet us analyze the coefficient of $p$, which is $1 - c_R + c_v c_R = 1 - c_R(1 - c_v)$. Since $c_v \\in (0,1)$ and $c_R \\in (0,1)$, the term $1 - c_v$ is between $0$ and $1$. The product $c_R(1 - c_v)$ is therefore also between $0$ and $1$. This ensures that the entire coefficient $1 - c_R(1 - c_v)$ is positive. We can divide by this coefficient without altering the inequality:\n$$\np > \\frac{c_v}{1 - c_R(1 - c_v)}\n$$\nThis inequality specifies the condition under which the virulent allele invades. The critical frequency $p^\\ast$ is the threshold value in this condition.
