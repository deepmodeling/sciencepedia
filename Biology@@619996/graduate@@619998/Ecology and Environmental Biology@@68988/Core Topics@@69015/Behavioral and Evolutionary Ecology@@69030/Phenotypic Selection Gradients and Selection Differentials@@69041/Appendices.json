It is based on standard definitions and principles within quantitative evolutionary ecology. All necessary data are provided, and no contradictions exist. We shall proceed with the formal derivation and subsequent calculations.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the phenotypic selection differential, $S$, and its calculation for two distinct cohorts.\n\n1. Derivation of the expression for $S$.\n\nThe phenotypic selection differential, $S$, is defined as the change in the mean phenotype from before selection to after selection, within a single generation. Let $\\bar{z}$ represent the mean phenotype of the entire initial cohort, and let $\\bar{z}'$ represent the mean phenotype of the selected individuals that will contribute to the next generation. The definition is thus:\n$$S = \\bar{z}' - \\bar{z}$$\n\nTo find $\\bar{z}'$, we must calculate the mean phenotype weighted by the reproductive contribution of each individual. The problem states that an individual's reproductive contribution is proportional to its absolute fitness, $W$. Therefore, the mean phenotype of the selected group, $\\bar{z}'$, is the expectation of the trait $z$ where each individual is weighted by its fitness $W$. In terms of expectations over the initial population distribution, this is:\n$$\\bar{z}' = \\frac{E[Wz]}{E[W]}$$\n\nThe denominator, $E[W]$, is simply the mean absolute fitness of the cohort, $\\bar{W}$. The numerator, $E[Wz]$, is the expectation of the product of the two random variables $W$ and $z$. We can express this using the definition of covariance:\n$$\\operatorname{Cov}(W, z) = E[Wz] - E[W]E[z]$$\n\nRearranging this identity to solve for $E[Wz]$ gives:\n$$E[Wz] = \\operatorname{Cov}(W, z) + E[W]E[z]$$\n\nSubstituting the known quantities $E[W] = \\bar{W}$ and $E[z] = \\bar{z}$, we have:\n$$E[Wz] = \\operatorname{Cov}(W, z) + \\bar{W}\\bar{z}$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression back into the formula for $\\bar{z}'$:\n$$\\bar{z}' = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(W, z) + \\bar{W}\\bar{z}}{\\bar{W}}$$\n\nThis can be split into two terms:\n$$\\bar{z}' = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(W, z)}{\\bar{W}} + \\frac{\\bar{W}\\bar{z}}{\\bar{W}} = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(W, z)}{\\bar{W}} + \\bar{z}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this result into the definition of the selection differential, $S$:\n$$S = \\bar{z}' - \\bar{z} = \\left( \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(W, z)}{\\bar{W}} + \\bar{z} \\right) - \\bar{z}$$\n$$S = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(W, z)}{\\bar{W}}$$\nThis is the required expression. It relates the response to selection within a generation ($S$) to the covariance between the trait and absolute fitness, normalized by the mean absolute fitness. This result is a cornerstone of selection theory, sometimes referred to as the Robertson-Price identity.\n\n2. Calculation of $S$ for Cohort A.\n\nFor Cohort A, the given parameters are $\\bar{W}_{\\text{A}} = 1.5$ and $\\operatorname{Cov}(W, z)_{\\text{A}} = 0.3$. Using the derived formula:\n$$S_{\\text{A}} = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(W, z)_{\\text{A}}}{\\bar{W}_{\\text{A}}} = \\frac{0.3}{1.5} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$$\n\n3. Calculation of $S$ for Cohort B.\n\nFor Cohort B, the given parameters are $\\bar{W}_{\\text{B}} = 2.0$ and $\\operatorname{Cov}(W, z)_{\\text{B}} = 0.3$. Using the derived formula:\n$$S_{\\text{B}} = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(W, z)_{\\text{B}}}{\\bar{W}_{\\text{B}}} = \\frac{0.3}{2.0} = 0.15$$\nThis demonstrates that for a fixed covariance between trait and fitness, the selection differential is smaller in a population with higher mean fitness.\n\n4.

We are tasked to first derive the fundamental equation relating the selection differential vector $\\mathbf{S}$, the phenotypic variance-covariance matrix $\\mathbf{P}$, and the selection gradient vector $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, and then to compute $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ and interpret its components for a given system. The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, providing all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nWe begin with the derivation. The problem states that relative fitness $w$ can be approximated as a linear function of the mean-centered phenotype vector $\\mathbf{z}=(z_1, z_2)^{\\top}$. This relationship is expressed by the linear regression model:\n$$w = \\alpha + \\beta_1 z_1 + \\beta_2 z_2 + \\epsilon$$\nIn vector notation, this is $w = \\alpha + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{\\top}\\mathbf{z} + \\epsilon$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = (\\beta_1, \\beta_2)^{\\top}$ is the vector of directional selection gradients and $\\epsilon$ is the error term.\n\nWe take the expectation of both sides. Given that the traits are mean-centered, $E[\\mathbf{z}] = \\mathbf{0}$. The ordinary least squares (OLS) model assumes that the expected value of the error term is zero, $E[\\epsilon] = 0$. The mean relative fitness is given as $\\bar{w} = E[w] = 1$.\n$$E[w] = E[\\alpha + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{\\top}\\mathbf{z} + \\epsilon] = \\alpha + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{\\top}E[\\mathbf{z}] + E[\\epsilon]$$\n$$1 = \\alpha + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{\\top}\\mathbf{0} + 0 \\implies \\alpha = 1$$\nThe linear model for fitness is thus $w = 1 + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{\\top}\\mathbf{z} + \\epsilon$.\n\nThe problem states that the selection differential vector $\\mathbf{S}$ equals the covariance between the traits and relative fitness. By definition, the covariance between a vector of variables $\\mathbf{z}$ and a scalar variable $w$ is:\n$$\\mathbf{S} = \\text{cov}(\\mathbf{z}, w) = E[(\\mathbf{z} - E[\\mathbf{z}])(w - E[w])]$$\nSubstituting the known means, $E[\\mathbf{z}] = \\mathbf{0}$ and $E[w] = 1$, we have:\n$$\\mathbf{S} = E[\\mathbf{z}(w - 1)]$$\nNow, substitute the expression for $(w-1)$ from our linear fitness model, $w - 1 = \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{\\top}\\mathbf{z} + \\epsilon = \\mathbf{z}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\epsilon$.\n$$\\mathbf{S} = E[\\mathbf{z}(\\mathbf{z}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\epsilon)]$$\nUsing the linearity of the expectation operator:\n$$\\mathbf{S} = E[\\mathbf{z}\\mathbf{z}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}] + E[\\mathbf{z}\\epsilon]$$\nSince $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is a vector of constant coefficients, it can be factored out of the expectation:\n$$\\mathbf{S} = E[\\mathbf{z}\\mathbf{z}^{\\top}]\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + E[\\mathbf{z}\\epsilon]$$\nThe term $E[\\mathbf{z}\\mathbf{z}^{\\top}]$ is, by definition, the variance-covariance matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ of the mean-centered traits. The term $E[\\mathbf{z}\\epsilon]$ represents the covariance between the predictor variables and the error term. A fundamental assumption of OLS regression (the \"orthogonality condition\") is that this covariance is zero, i.e., $E[\\mathbf{z}\\epsilon] = \\mathbf{0}$.\nSubstituting these identities, we arrive at the required relationship:\n$$\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{P}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$$\nThis equation is a cornerstone of multivariate selection analysis. It demonstrates that the total evolutionary response to selection on a set of traits ($\\mathbf{S}$) is a product of the direct selection pressures on those traits ($\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$) and the pattern of phenotypic variation and covariation among them ($\\mathbf{P}$).\n\nNext, we compute the selection gradient vector $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ for the given system. We rearrange the derived equation to solve for $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{S}$$\nThe provided matrices are:\n$$\\mathbf{P} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 9 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{S} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.2 \\\\ -0.3 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nFirst, we compute the inverse of the phenotypic variance-covariance matrix, $\\mathbf{P}^{-1}$. For a general $2 \\times 2$ matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$, the inverse is $\\frac{1}{ad-bc}\\begin{pmatrix} d & -b \\\\ -c & a \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe determinant of $\\mathbf{P}$ is $\\det(\\mathbf{P}) = (4)(9) - (1)(1) = 36 - 1 = 35$.\nThus, the inverse is:\n$$\\mathbf{P}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{35}\\begin{pmatrix} 9 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nNow, we perform the matrix multiplication $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{S}$. To maintain exactness, we express the components of $\\mathbf{S}$ as fractions: $0.2 = \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{1}{5}$ and $-0.3 = -\\frac{3}{10}$.\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\frac{1}{35}\\begin{pmatrix} 9 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1/5 \\\\ -3/10 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\frac{1}{35}\\begin{pmatrix} (9)(\\frac{1}{5}) + (-1)(-\\frac{3}{10}) \\\\ (-1)(\\frac{1}{5}) + (4)(-\\frac{3}{10}) \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{35}\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{9}{5} + \\frac{3}{10} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{12}{10} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nTo combine the terms within the vector, we find a common denominator:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\frac{1}{35}\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{18}{10} + \\frac{3}{10} \\\\ -\\frac{2}{10} - \\frac{12}{10} \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{35}\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{21}{10} \\\\ -\\frac{14}{10} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nFinally, we multiply by the scalar $\\frac{1}{35}$:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{21}{350} \\\\ -\\frac{14}{350} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3 \\times 7}{50 \\times 7} \\\\ -\\frac{2 \\times 7}{50 \\times 7} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{50} \\\\ -\\frac{2}{50} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{50} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{25} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nSo, the components of the selection gradient vector are $\\beta_1 = \\frac{3}{50}$ and $\\beta_2 = -\\frac{1}{25}$.\n\nFinally, we interpret these components. The selection gradient $\\beta_i$ is the partial derivative of relative fitness with respect to trait $z_i$, $\\beta_i = \\partial w / \\partial z_i$. It quantifies the strength of *direct* selection on a trait, holding all other traits in the analysis constant.\nThe first component, $\\beta_1 = \\frac{3}{50} = 0.06$, is positive. This indicates that there is direct positive directional selection on trait $z_1$. An increase of one unit in trait $z_1$, while holding trait $z_2$ constant, corresponds to an increase of $0.06$ in an individual's expected relative fitness.\nThe second component, $\\beta_2 = -\\frac{1}{25} = -0.04$, is negative. This indicates that there is direct negative directional selection (i.e., selection for smaller trait values) on trait $z_2$. An increase of one unit in trait $z_2$, while holding trait $z_1$ constant, corresponds to a decrease of $0.04$ in expected relative fitness.\nIt is crucial to distinguish this from the selection differential $\\mathbf{S}$. The selection differential $S_i$ measures the total change in the mean of trait $i$ and is a function of both direct selection on trait $i$ and indirect selection that arises because trait $i$ is correlated with other traits under selection.
