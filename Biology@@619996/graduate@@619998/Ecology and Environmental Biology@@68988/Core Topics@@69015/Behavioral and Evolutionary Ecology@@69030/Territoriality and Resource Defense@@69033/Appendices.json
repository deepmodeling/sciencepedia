It is scientifically grounded in optimality theory, a core principle in this discipline. The mathematical model is well-posed, using continuous and differentiable functions (exponential and linear terms) which are common for modeling biological trade-offs with diminishing returns and linear costs. All parameters and functions are explicitly defined, and the units are dimensionally consistent. For example, the product $b(t_d)(T-t_d)$ yields units of energy ($\\mathrm{kJ\\,h^{-1}} \\times \\mathrm{h} = \\mathrm{kJ}$), as do all other terms in the payoff function. The problem is self-contained, objective, and does not violate any fundamental principles of mathematics or science. It requires a standard application of differential calculus to find the maximum of a function over a closed interval.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to find the value of $t_{d}$ in the interval $[0, T]$ that maximizes the expected net daily energy payoff, $P(t_{d})$. The payoff function is given by:\n$$P(t_{d}) = b(t_{d})\\,(T - t_{d}) - c_{p}\\,t_{d} - E\\,\\lambda(t_{d})$$\nWe substitute the expressions for $b(t_{d})$ and $\\lambda(t_{d})$:\n$$P(t_{d}) = \\left[b_{0} + \\alpha \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\beta t_{d})\\right)\\right](T - t_{d}) - c_{p}\\,t_{d} - E\\,\\lambda_{0}\\,t_{d}$$\nTo find the maximum, we must compute the first derivative of $P(t_{d})$ with respect to $t_{d}$ and set it to zero. First, let us group the linear terms in $t_{d}$:\n$$P(t_{d}) = \\left(b_{0} + \\alpha\\right)(T - t_{d}) - \\alpha(T - t_{d})\\exp(-\\beta t_{d}) - (c_{p} + E \\lambda_{0})t_{d}$$\nNow, we differentiate $P(t_{d})$ with respect to $t_{d}$, using the product rule for the term $-\\alpha(T - t_{d})\\exp(-\\beta t_{d})$:\n$$\\frac{dP}{dt_{d}} = -(b_{0} + \\alpha) - \\alpha\\left[(-1)\\exp(-\\beta t_{d}) + (T - t_{d})(-\\beta\\exp(-\\beta t_{d}))\\right] - (c_{p} + E \\lambda_{0})$$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$\\frac{dP}{dt_{d}} = -(b_{0} + \\alpha) + \\alpha\\exp(-\\beta t_{d}) + \\alpha\\beta(T - t_{d})\\exp(-\\beta t_{d}) - (c_{p} + E \\lambda_{0})$$\nFactoring out the term $\\alpha\\exp(-\\beta t_{d})$:\n$$\\frac{dP}{dt_{d}} = \\alpha\\exp(-\\beta t_{d}) \\left[1 + \\beta(T - t_{d})\\right] - (b_{0} + \\alpha + c_{p} + E \\lambda_{0})$$\nTo find the critical points, we set the derivative to zero:\n$$\\alpha\\exp(-\\beta t_{d}^{\\star}) \\left[1 + \\beta(T - t_{d}^{\\star})\\right] = b_{0} + \\alpha + c_{p} + E \\lambda_{0}$$\nThis is the optimality condition. To verify that a solution $t_{d}^{\\star}$ corresponds to a maximum, we check the sign of the second derivative, $P''(t_d)$.\n$$P''(t_d) = \\frac{d^{2}P}{dt_{d}^{2}} = \\alpha \\left\\{ (-\\beta \\exp(-\\beta t_d))[1 + \\beta(T-t_d)] + (\\exp(-\\beta t_d))(-\\beta) \\right\\}$$\n$$P''(t_d) = -\\alpha \\beta \\exp(-\\beta t_d) \\left[ 1 + \\beta(T-t_d) + 1 \\right]$$\n$$P''(t_d) = -\\alpha \\beta \\exp(-\\beta t_d) \\left[ 2 + \\beta T - \\beta t_d \\right]$$\nGiven that $\\alpha > 0$, $\\beta > 0$, and $\\exp(-\\beta t_d) > 0$, the sign of $P''(t_d)$ is determined by the term in the brackets. The parameters are $T=24$, $\\beta=0.2$. Thus, $2 + \\beta T = 2 + 0.2 \\times 24 = 2 + 4.8 = 6.8$. The term becomes $6.8 - 0.2 t_d$. For any $t_d$ in the valid range $[0, 24]$, this term is positive ($6.8 - 0.2 \\times 24 = 6.8 - 4.8 = 2 > 0$). Therefore, $P''(t_d)$ is always negative on the domain of interest. This confirms the function $P(t_d)$ is strictly concave, and the critical point is a unique global maximum.\n\nWe now solve the optimality condition for $t_{d}^{\\star}$ by first subituting the given numerical values:\n- $T = 24$\n- $c_{p} = 40$\n- $b_{0} = 100$\n- $\\alpha = 60$\n- $\\beta = 0.2$\n- $\\lambda_{0} = 0.05$\n- $E = 500$\nThe right side of the optimality condition is:\n$$b_{0} + \\alpha + c_{p} + E \\lambda_{0} = 100 + 60 + 40 + (500)(0.05) = 200 + 25 = 225$$\nThe equation becomes:\n$$60 \\exp(-0.2 t_{d}^{\\star}) \\left[1 + 0.2(24 - t_{d}^{\\star})\\right] = 225$$\n$$\\exp(-0.2 t_{d}^{\\star}) \\left[1 + 4.8 - 0.2 t_{d}^{\\star}\\right] = \\frac{225}{60}$$\n$$\\exp(-0.2 t_{d}^{\\star}) \\left[5.8 - 0.2 t_{d}^{\\star}\\right] = 3.75$$\nThis is a transcendental equation for $t_{d}^{\\star}$ that cannot be solved analytically using elementary functions. We must use a numerical method. Let $f(t_d) = \\exp(-0.2 t_d) (5.8 - 0.2 t_d) - 3.75$. We search for the root of $f(t_d) = 0$ in the interval $[0, 24]$.\nAt $t_d = 0$, $f(0) = \\exp(0)(5.8) - 3.75 = 2.05 > 0$.\nAt $t_d = T=24$, $f(24) = \\exp(-4.8)(5.8 - 4.8) - 3.75 = \\exp(-4.8) - 3.75 < 0$.\nSince the function is continuous and changes sign, a root exists in the interval. As $P''(t_d)<0$, $P'(t_d)$ is monotonically decreasing, so this root is unique.\nUsing a numerical solver (e.g., Newton's method or a bisection method), we find the solution:\n$$t_{d}^{\\star} \\approx 1.85135\\,\\mathrm{h}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$t_{d}^{\\star} \\approx 1.85\\,\\mathrm{h}$$\nThis value lies within the valid domain $[0, 24]$, and represents the optimal time allocation to defense that maximizes the bird's net daily energy gain.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1.85} $$", "id": "2537303"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the daily time budget of a single individual, a key question in ecology is what determines the size of a territory across different species or environments.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is derived from the given equilibrium condition, which states that the expected energy intake from a territory must equal the animal's metabolic energy requirement.

Substituting this expression for $E(M)$ into the equilibrium equation yields:\n$$a R T = k M^{3/4}$$\nThe first task is to derive how territory area, $T$, scales with body mass, $M$, and resource density, $R$. To achieve this, we must algebraically isolate $T$ on one side of the equation. Dividing both sides by the product $a R$ gives:\n$$T = \\frac{k M^{3/4}}{a R}$$\nSince $k$ and $a$ are defined as constants, we can express this as a proportionality:\n$$T \\propto M^{3/4} R^{-1}$$\nThis is the scaling relationship for territory area. It shows that territory area increases with body mass to the power of $3/4$ and is inversely proportional to the resource density.\n\nThe second task is to compute the multiplicative change in territory area, $T$, for a specified change in $M$ and $R$. Let the initial state be defined by variables $(T_1, M_1, R_1)$ and the final state by $(T_2, M_2, R_2)$.

The problem specifies that the drift velocity, $v(x_b)$, is proportional to the difference between the marginal net payoffs for a rightward shift for defender $A$ and a leftward shift for defender $B$.\n\nLet us first formalize the marginal net payoff for each defender at the boundary position $x_b$. The net payoff is the difference between the gross benefit gained and the cost incurred.\n\nFor defender $A$, located at $x=0$, a hypothetical infinitesimal rightward shift of the boundary by $\\mathrm{d}x_b > 0$ results in the acquisition of a territory segment of length $\\mathrm{d}x_b$.\nThe marginal gross benefit to $A$ from this shift is given as $b_A \\rho(x_b) \\mathrm{d}x_b$.\nThe distance of the boundary from $A$'s refuge is $d_A(x_b) = x_b$.
