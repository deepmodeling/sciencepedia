It is a well-posed problem in theoretical evolutionary biology, grounded in the established principles of kin selection and inclusive fitness. It is self-contained, scientifically sound, and free of contradictions or ambiguities. I will now proceed with the formal derivation and analysis.\n\nThe fundamental principle for the evolution of a social behavior is that the strategy encoding the behavior must yield a positive net change in the actor's inclusive fitness. The inclusive fitness effect, $\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{IF}}$, is the sum of the effects on the actor's own fitness and the effects on the fitness of its relatives, with the latter devalued by the coefficient of relatedness.\n\nThe strategy is to help if and only if a partner is perceived as kin. We must calculate the expected inclusive fitness change per social opportunity, which we denote as $\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{opp}}$. An opportunity is a single encounter with a social partner. The partner is a true kin with probability $p$ and a non-kin with probability $1-p$.\n\nWe sum the inclusive fitness effects over all possible outcomes of an encounter:\n1.  The partner is kin (probability $p$) and is correctly perceived as kin (probability $1-\\beta$). The actor helps. The inclusive fitness effect is the cost to self, $-c$, plus the benefit to the kin recipient weighted by relatedness, $r_k b$. The net effect for this event is $-c + r_k b$.\n2.  The partner is kin (probability $p$) and is incorrectly perceived as non-kin (probability $\\beta$). The actor does not help. The inclusive fitness effect is $0$.\n3.  The partner is non-kin (probability $1-p$) and is incorrectly perceived as kin (probability $\\alpha$). The actor helps. The inclusive fitness effect is $-c + r_0 b$.\n4.  The partner is non-kin (probability $1-p$) and is correctly perceived as non-kin (probability $1-\\alpha$). The actor does not help. The inclusive fitness effect is $0$.\n\nThe expected inclusive fitness change per social opportunity is the probability-weighted sum of these outcomes:\n$$\n\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{opp}} = p(1-\\beta)(-c + r_k b) + p\\beta(0) + (1-p)\\alpha(-c + r_0 b) + (1-p)(1-\\alpha)(0)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{opp}} = p(1-\\beta)r_k b - p(1-\\beta)c + (1-p)\\alpha r_0 b - (1-p)\\alpha c\n$$\nGrouping the benefit and cost terms separately gives:\n$$\n\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{opp}} = \\big[ p(1-\\beta)r_k + (1-p)\\alpha r_0 \\big]b - \\big[ p(1-\\beta) + (1-p)\\alpha \\big]c\n$$\nThe behavioral strategy is favored by natural selection if and only if $\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{opp}} > 0$. Therefore, the condition for helping to evolve is:\n$$\n\\big[ p(1-\\beta)r_k + (1-p)\\alpha r_0 \\big]b > \\big[ p(1-\\beta) + (1-p)\\alpha \\big]c\n$$\nThis inequality can be rearranged to a form resembling the classic Hamilton's rule, $rb > c$. We divide by the total probability of giving help, which is $P(\\text{help}) = p(1-\\beta) + (1-p)\\alpha$. Assuming this probability is greater than zero (i.e., help is sometimes given), the condition becomes:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{p(1-\\beta)r_k + (1-p)\\alpha r_0}{p(1-\\beta) + (1-p)\\alpha} \\right) b > c\n$$\nThe term in the parenthesis is the average relatedness of the actor to recipients, conditional on help being performed. We define this as the effective relatedness, $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{eff}} = E[r | \\text{help is given}] = \\frac{p(1-\\beta)r_k + (1-p)\\alpha r_0}{p(1-\\beta) + (1-p)\\alpha}\n$$\nThe condition for the helping strategy to be favored thus simplifies to the per-act Hamilton's rule: $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}b > c$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Conditional on help being given, the parameters $b$ and $c$ per act are unchanged by recognition error. The only modification to the per-act Hamilton’s rule criterion is via the effective relatedness among actual recipients of help,\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\;=\\; \\frac{p(1-\\beta)\\, r_k \\;+\\; (1-p)\\alpha\\, r_0}{p(1-\\beta) \\;+\\; (1-p)\\alpha},\n$$\nso that helping is favored for an act if and only if $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\, b \\;>\\; c$.**\n\nThis statement is entirely consistent with our derivation. The problem states that $b$ and $c$ are constant per act. Our derivation shows that the overall condition for the strategy's success can be expressed as a per-act rule where the cost $c$ is compared against the benefit $b$ weighted by an effective relatedness $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The formula provided for $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is identical to the one we derived. This represents the average relatedness to actual recipients, correctly accounting for both types of recognition errors.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. False positives inflate the realized cost per helping act to $c/(1-\\alpha)$ because some help goes to non-kin, but the realized $b$ and $r$ per act remain unchanged.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. First, the cost per helping act is given as $c$. The quantity $c/(1-\\alpha)$ has no theoretical justification and is dimensionally inconsistent if interpreted as a modified cost. The recognition errors affect the *frequency* and *targeting* of altruistic acts, not the intrinsic cost of a single act. Second, the assertion that the \"realized $r$ per act\" remains unchanged is false. As shown in the derivation of $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, the average relatedness of a recipient is a function of both $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. The entire point is that recognition errors modify the realized (i.e., average) relatedness of recipients.\n\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. The expected inclusive fitness effect per social opportunity equals\n$$\n\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{opp}} \\;=\\; \\big[p(1-\\beta)\\, r_k\\, b \\;+\\; (1-p)\\alpha\\, r_0\\, b\\big] \\;-\\; \\big[p(1-\\beta) \\;+\\; (1-p)\\alpha\\big]\\, c,\n$$\nso both $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ reduce the realized benefit term and increase the realized cost term.**\n\nThe formula presented for $\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{opp}}$ is correct; it matches our derivation. However, the subsequent interpretation is flawed. Let's analyze the effect of increasing the error rates on the \"realized benefit term\" $B_{\\mathrm{term}} = [p(1-\\beta)r_k + (1-p)\\alpha r_0]b$ and the \"realized cost term\" $C_{\\mathrm{term}} = [p(1-\\beta) + (1-p)\\alpha]c$.\n-   An increase in the false positive rate $\\alpha$ *increases* $C_{\\mathrm{term}}$ because more help is given. It also *increases* $B_{\\mathrm{term}}$ (assuming typical case $r_0 \\ge 0$), as benefits are now also dispensed to non-kin. The statement claims it reduces the benefit term, which is incorrect.\n-   An increase in the false negative rate $\\beta$ *decreases* both $B_{\\mathrm{term}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{term}}$ because a higher $\\beta$ leads to fewer helping acts being directed toward kin, thus reducing the total benefits dispensed and total costs incurred per opportunity. The statement claims it increases the cost term, which is incorrect.\n\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. False negatives increase the realized per-act benefit $b$ experienced by kin who are helped by a factor $1/(1-\\beta)$ because kin-helping events become rarer and concentrate benefits.**\n\nThis is nonsensical. The problem explicitly premises that the benefit $b$ per act is a constant. The rate of false negatives, $\\beta$, influences the *probability* of a kin being helped, not the *magnitude* of the benefit if help is given. The \"concentration of benefits\" argument has no basis in the model's structure. Lowering the probability of an event does not increase the payoff of the event when it does occur.\n\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. In the special case $r_0 = 0$, reducing $\\alpha$ strictly increases $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and thus relaxes the relatedness threshold for helping, while increasing $\\beta$ reduces $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ but simultaneously lowers the expected cost per social opportunity by reducing the frequency of helping events.**\n\nLet's examine this in the special case $r_0=0$.\nThe effective relatedness becomes $r_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{p(1-\\beta)r_k}{p(1-\\beta) + (1-p)\\alpha}$.\n1.  **Effect of $\\alpha$**: The denominator increases with $\\alpha$ while the numerator is constant. Thus, increasing $\\alpha$ decreases $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. Consequently, reducing $\\alpha$ strictly increases $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. A higher $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ makes the condition $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}b > c$ easier to meet, which means the threshold for helping is relaxed. This part is correct.\n2.  **Effect of $\\beta$ on $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$**: We can write $r_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{r_k}{1 + \\frac{(1-p)\\alpha}{p(1-\\beta)}}$. As $\\beta$ increases, $1-\\beta$ decreases, the fraction in the denominator increases (for $\\alpha>0$), and thus $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ decreases. This part is correct.\n3.  **Effect of $\\beta$ on expected cost**: The expected cost per social opportunity is $C_{\\mathrm{opp}} = [p(1-\\beta) + (1-p)\\alpha]c$. The derivative with respect to $\\beta$ is $\\frac{\\partial C_{\\mathrm{opp}}}{\\partial \\beta} = -pc$. Since $p>0$ and $c>0$, this derivative is negative. Therefore, increasing $\\beta$ lowers the expected cost per social opportunity. This is because fewer kin are helped, reducing the overall frequency of helping acts. This part is also correct.\n\nThe statement accurately describes the tradeoffs associated with recognition errors in this specific scenario.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "2471192"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice delves into the dynamic and often antagonistic world of social evolution, using tools from theoretical biology to model a classic conflict.

Within each group, individuals express one of two heritable strategies in a single social interaction before reproduction proportional to fitness: a cooperator or a cheater. A cooperator invests an amount $x>0$ of a diffusible Public Good (PG), incurring a direct viability cost proportional to its investment, $c x$ with $c>0$. A cheater invests $x=0$ and additionally secretes a factor that suppresses the realized production of any cooperator in its group. Specifically, if the fraction of cheaters among a focal cooperator’s group-mates (excluding self) is $\\phi_{D}\\in[0,1]$, then the focal cooperator’s realized effective production is reduced multiplicatively to $x\\,(1-s\\,\\phi_{D})$, where $s\\in[0,1)$ quantifies suppression strength.

It is a valid problem in theoretical evolutionary biology.\n\nWe are tasked with deriving the condition for the evolution of increased investment in a public good, $x$, and finding the critical relatedness threshold, $r^*$. The framework for this analysis is inclusive fitness theory, which assesses the evolutionary success of a trait based on its total effect on the actor's genes, both those in the actor itself and those in its social partners.\n\nThe selection gradient on a modifier allele that increases the investment $x$ by an infinitesimal amount $\\delta x$ is positive if the corresponding change in inclusive fitness is positive. The change in the inclusive fitness of a focal individual, $i$, due to its own action is given by the sum of the change in its own fitness and the changes in the fitness of all its social partners, each weighted by the coefficient of relatedness, $r$, between the focal individual and the respective partner. For a group of size $N$ with uniform relatedness $r$ among non-self partners, the change in inclusive fitness, $\\Delta W_{\\text{IF}}$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta W_{\\text{IF}} = \\Delta w_i + r \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\Delta w_j\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta w_i$ is the change in the focal individual's fitness due to its own action, and $\\Delta w_j$ is the change in the fitness of a group-mate $j$ due to the focal's action. We are asked to compute these marginal fitness effects.\n\nLet the focal individual $i$ be a cooperator that increases its investment from $x_i$ to $x_i + \\delta x$.\n\nFirst, we compute the change in the focal individual's own fitness, $\\Delta w_i$. The fitness of individual $i$ is given by:\n$$\nw_i = w_0 + \\frac{b}{N}\\sum_{k=1}^{N} E_k - c x_i\n$$\nThe change in $w_i$ due to the change in $x_i$ is found by calculating the partial derivative of $w_i$ with respect to $x_i$ and multiplying by $\\delta x$.\n$$\n\\Delta w_i \\approx \\frac{\\partial w_i}{\\partial x_i} \\delta x = \\left( \\frac{b}{N} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} E_k - c \\right) \\delta x\n$$\nThe sum of productions is $\\sum_k E_k = E_i + \\sum_{j \\neq i} E_j$.

Therefore, $\\frac{\\partial E_j}{\\partial x_i} = 0$ for $j \\neq i$. The focal's own production is $E_i = x_i(1 - s \\phi_{D,i})$, where $\\phi_{D,i}$ is the fraction of cheaters among its $N-1$ group-mates. This fraction does not depend on the level of investment $x_i$, only on the strategies of the group-mates. Thus:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_i}{\\partial x_i} = 1 - s \\phi_{D,i}\n$$\nThe change in the focal's fitness is:\n$$\n\\Delta w_i = \\left( \\frac{b}{N}(1 - s \\phi_{D,i}) - c \\right) \\delta x\n$$\n\nSecond, we compute the change in the fitness of a group-mate, $j$ (where $j \\neq i$), due to the focal's action.\n$$\nw_j = w_0 + \\frac{b}{N}\\sum_{k=1}^{N} E_k - c x_j\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta w_j \\approx \\frac{\\partial w_j}{\\partial x_i} \\delta x = \\left( \\frac{b}{N} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} E_k - c \\frac{\\partial x_j}{\\partial x_i} \\right) \\delta x\n$$\nSince $j \\neq i$, $x_j$ and $x_i$ are independent variables, so $\\frac{\\partial x_j}{\\partial x_i} = 0$.

This simplifies the analysis by assuming that the selective environment experienced by a rare mutant is one dominated by cheaters, thus maximizing the effect of suppression on production.
