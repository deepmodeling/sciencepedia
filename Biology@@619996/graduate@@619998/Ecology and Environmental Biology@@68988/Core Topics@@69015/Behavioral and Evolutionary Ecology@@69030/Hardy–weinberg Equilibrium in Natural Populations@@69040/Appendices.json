It is scientifically grounded in the principles of population genetics, specifically the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data—the allele frequencies for a three-allele system—which sum to unity ($0.5 + 0.3 + 0.2 = 1.0$), and the conditions for HWE are explicitly stated. The terminology is precise, and the objective is clear. Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nThe fundamental principle of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for a diploid, sexually reproducing population under the specified conditions (large size, random mating, no evolutionary forces) states that genotype frequencies in a generation are determined by the allele frequencies in the gamete pool of the previous generation. For a locus with multiple alleles, the expected genotype frequencies are given by the terms of the multinomial expansion of the sum of allele frequencies squared.\n\nLet the frequencies of the three alleles $A$, $B$, and $C$ in the gamete pool be denoted by $p_A$, $p_B$, and $p_C$, respectively. The problem provides these values:\n$$p_A = 0.5$$\n$$p_B = 0.3$$\n$$p_C = 0.2$$\n\nUnder the assumption of random union of gametes, the formation of a zygotic genotype is equivalent to two independent draws from the gamete pool. The frequency of any specific genotype is thus the product of the frequencies of the two alleles composing it, accounting for all combinations that produce the genotype.\n\nThe expected frequencies of the six possible genotypes are derived as follows:\n\nFor the homozygous genotypes:\nThe frequency of genotype $AA$, denoted $f(AA)$, is the probability of drawing an $A$ allele and another $A$ allele:\n$$f(AA) = p_A \\times p_A = p_A^2$$\nSimilarly for genotypes $BB$ and $CC$:\n$$f(BB) = p_B \\times p_B = p_B^2$$\n$$f(CC) = p_C \\times p_C = p_C^2$$\n\nFor the heterozygous genotypes:\nThe genotype $AB$ can be formed in two ways: inheriting $A$ from one parent and $B$ from the other, or inheriting $B$ from the one and $A$ from the other. Therefore, its frequency is:\n$$f(AB) = (p_A \\times p_B) + (p_B \\times p_A) = 2p_A p_B$$\nSimilarly for genotypes $AC$ and $BC$:\n$$f(AC) = 2p_A p_C$$\n$$f(BC) = 2p_B p_C$$\n\nThe sum of these genotype frequencies is given by the expansion of $(p_A + p_B + p_C)^2$, which must equal $1$, as $(p_A + p_B + p_C)$ is equal to $1$.\n$$(p_A + p_B + p_C)^2 = p_A^2 + p_B^2 + p_C^2 + 2p_A p_B + 2p_A p_C + 2p_B p_C = 1$$\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the expected homozygosity, which is defined as the total expected frequency of all homozygous genotypes. Let us denote the expected homozygosity as $H$.\n$$H = f(AA) + f(BB) + f(CC)$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for the genotype frequencies:\n$$H = p_A^2 + p_B^2 + p_C^2$$\nThis expression represents the probability that two alleles drawn at random from the gene pool are identical by state.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values for the allele frequencies into this equation:\n$$H = (0.5)^2 + (0.3)^2 + (0.2)^2$$\nPerforming the calculations:\n$$H = 0.25 + 0.09 + 0.04$$\n$$H = 0.38$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal number rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $0.38$. To present this with four significant figures, we must add trailing zeros.\n$$H = 0.3800$$\nThis is the final expected homozygosity for the population.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3800}$$", "id": "2497813"}, {"introduction": "The Hardy-Weinberg principle provides a null hypothesis for the genetic structure of a population, against which we can test real data.

Assume no genotyping error and that allele copy numbers sum to twice the number of individuals sampled.\n\nUsing only the foundational definitions for diploid allele frequencies and the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, together with the definition of the Pearson chi-square goodness-of-fit (GOF) test without continuity correction, do the following:\n\n- From the observed counts, infer the sample allele frequency $p$ of allele $A$ and the frequency $q$ of allele $a$.\n- Under the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, derive the expected genotype counts for $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$.\n- Compute the Pearson chi-square GOF test statistic that compares the observed counts to the expected counts under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, using the appropriate degrees of freedom given that allele frequencies are estimated from the data.\n- Based on the direction of deviation in the heterozygote class relative to its expectation, state whether the observed pattern reflects a heterozygote deficit or a heterozygote excess.\n\nProvide as your final numerical answer only the value of the chi-square test statistic. Do not include an interpretation in the final answer box. No rounding instruction is necessary for this problem.", "solution": "The problem is well-defined and scientifically sound. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we must establish the given information. We are provided with the observed genotype counts for a bi-allelic locus with alleles $A$ and $a$.\nThe observed counts are:\n- Number of $AA$ individuals: $N_{AA} = 30$\n- Number of $Aa$ individuals: $N_{Aa} = 40$\n- Number of $aa$ individuals: $N_{aa} = 30$\n\nThe total number of individuals in the sample, $N$, is the sum of these counts:\n$$N = N_{AA} + N_{Aa} + N_{aa} = 30 + 40 + 30 = 100$$\nSince the organisms are diploid, the total number of alleles in the sample is $2N = 2 \\times 100 = 200$.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the frequencies of the alleles $A$ and $a$ from the observed data. The frequency of allele $A$, denoted by $p$, is calculated by counting all copies of the $A$ allele and dividing by the total number of alleles. Each $AA$ individual carries $2$ copies of the $A$ allele, and each $Aa$ individual carries $1$ copy.\nThe total number of $A$ alleles is given by $2 \\times N_{AA} + N_{Aa}$.\n$$p = \\frac{2 N_{AA} + N_{Aa}}{2N} = \\frac{2 \\times 30 + 40}{200} = \\frac{60 + 40}{200} = \\frac{100}{200} = 0.5$$\n\nSimilarly, the frequency of allele $a$, denoted by $q$, is calculated by counting all copies of the $a$ allele. Each $aa$ individual carries $2$ copies of the $a$ allele, and each $Aa$ individual carries $1$ copy.\nThe total number of $a$ alleles is given by $2 \\times N_{aa} + N_{Aa}$.\n$$q = \\frac{2 N_{aa} + N_{Aa}}{2N} = \\frac{2 \\times 30 + 40}{200} = \\frac{60 + 40}{200} = \\frac{100}{200} = 0.5$$\nAs a necessary check, the sum of the allele frequencies must be $1$: $p + q = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1$. This is correct.\n\nThe second step is to determine the expected genotype counts under the hypothesis of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The HWE principle states that the expected genotype frequencies in a population are $p^2$ for $AA$, $2pq$ for $Aa$, and $q^2$ for $aa$.\nUsing the calculated allele frequencies, $p=0.5$ and $q=0.5$:\n- Expected frequency of $AA$: $p^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25$\n- Expected frequency of $Aa$: $2pq = 2 \\times 0.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.5$\n- Expected frequency of $aa$: $q^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25$\n\nTo find the expected counts, we multiply these frequencies by the total sample size, $N=100$:\n- Expected count of $AA$: $E_{AA} = N \\times p^2 = 100 \\times 0.25 = 25$\n- Expected count of $Aa$: $E_{Aa} = N \\times 2pq = 100 \\times 0.5 = 50$\n- Expected count of $aa$: $E_{aa} = N \\times q^2 = 100 \\times 0.25 = 25$\nThe sum of expected counts is $25 + 50 + 25 = 100$, which matches the total sample size.\n\nThe third step is to compute the Pearson chi-square ($\\chi^2$) goodness-of-fit test statistic, which quantifies the discrepancy between observed ($O$) and expected ($E$) counts. The formula is:\n$$\\chi^2 = \\sum_{i} \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$$\nWe apply this formula to our three genotype classes:\nFor the $AA$ genotype: $\\frac{(O_{AA} - E_{AA})^2}{E_{AA}} = \\frac{(30 - 25)^2}{25} = \\frac{5^2}{25} = \\frac{25}{25} = 1$\nFor the $Aa$ genotype: $\\frac{(O_{Aa} - E_{Aa})^2}{E_{Aa}} = \\frac{(40 - 50)^2}{50} = \\frac{(-10)^2}{50} = \\frac{100}{50} = 2$\nFor the $aa$ genotype: $\\frac{(O_{aa} - E_{aa})^2}{E_{aa}} = \\frac{(30 - 25)^2}{25} = \\frac{5^2}{25} = \\frac{25}{25} = 1$\n\nThe $\\chi^2$ statistic is the sum of these values:\n$$\\chi^2 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$$\nThe degrees of freedom for this test are the number of categories minus $1$, minus the number of independent parameters estimated from the data. We have $3$ categories (genotypes), and we estimated $1$ parameter ($p$, since $q=1-p$). Thus, the degrees of freedom are $df = 3 - 1 - 1 = 1$.\n\nFinally, we determine the direction of deviation. The observed count of heterozygotes is $O_{Aa} = 40$. The expected count of heterozygotes under HWE is $E_{Aa} = 50$. Since $O_{Aa} < E_{Aa}$, there is an observed deficit of heterozygotes relative to the Hardy-Weinberg expectation.\n\nThe problem requires only the numerical value of the chi-square test statistic.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "2497854"}, {"introduction": "When a statistical test reveals a significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the next scientific step is to investigate the potential causes, such as non-random mating.

The probability that they are not IBD is $1-F$.\n\nWe can calculate the expected frequency of each genotype by considering these two mutually exclusive events:\n1. The two alleles are IBD (with probability $F$). If they are IBD, they must be of the same type. The individual is homozygous $AA$ if the ancestral allele was $A$ (with probability $p$) and homozygous $aa$ if the ancestral allele was $a$ (with probability $q$). A heterozygote $Aa$ is not possible if the alleles are IBD.\n   - $\\Pr(AA | \\text{IBD}) = p$\n   - $\\Pr(aa | \\text{IBD}) = q$\n   - $\\Pr(Aa | \\text{IBD}) = 0$\n\n2.

A positive $F$ value indicates that the observed heterozygosity ($H_{obs}=0.2$) is lower than the expected heterozygosity under random mating ($H_E=0.48$). This deficit of heterozygotes is a standard signature of inbreeding or positive assortative mating (mating between individuals of similar genotypes).
