On encounter with prey $i$, the forager can either accept it (always successful capture) or reject it. If accepted, prey $i$ yields energetic reward $E_i$ (kilojoules) and requires handling time $h_i$ (minutes), during which no searching occurs. Assume that recognition and decision-making are instantaneous, there is no interference among prey, and the environment is stationary so that rates and rewards are constant. The forager’s objective under Optimal Foraging Theory (OFT) is to maximize the long-run average energy intake rate.\n\nStarting from first principles, namely: (i) Poisson encounter processes and their linearity of expectations, and (ii) the renewal-reward logic that the long-run average intake rate equals expected energetic reward per renewal divided by expected time per renewal, derive an expression for the long-run average intake rate of any fixed acceptance set and use it to characterize when adding a prey type to the diet increases the long-run average intake rate. Then apply this characterization (the zero-one rule) to determine the optimal diet when the prey parameters are $(E_A,h_A,\\lambda_A)=(10,1,0.3)$ and $(E_B,h_B,\\lambda_B)=(5,0.6,0.7)$.

The aim is to choose $(a_A,a_B)$ to maximize the long-run average energy intake rate.\n\nWe begin from renewal-reward logic. Consider a renewal anchored on one unit of search time. During one unit of search time, the expected number of encounters of type $i$ is $\\lambda_i$ by properties of a Poisson process. If prey $i$ is accepted, the expected energetic reward accrued per unit search time from type $i$ is therefore $\\lambda_i a_i E_i$, and the expected handling time accrued per unit search time from type $i$ is $\\lambda_i a_i h_i$.

[@problem_id:2515975]", "problem": "A central-place forager repeatedly chooses among alternative prey-processing bouts. For option $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$, a bout consists of a dedicated foraging time $T_i$ during which an energetic gain $E_i$ is accrued, and an overhead time $T_0$ (e.g., outbound and inbound travel, preparation, or setup) that is identical across options within a decision episode. The long-run energy intake rate when consistently choosing option $i$ is defined as the ratio of energy to total time, namely $E_i/(T_i+T_0)$. In some analyses, the overhead time is treated as negligible and the “within-bout” currency $E_i/T_i$ is used instead.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definition of rate as energy per unit time and without invoking any pre-derived foraging rules, address the following:\n\n1.

We are given two options, $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, each characterized by an energetic gain $E_i$ and a dedicated foraging time $T_i$. The long-run energy intake rate, which is the correct currency for optimization, is $R_i(T_0) = \\frac{E_i}{T_i + T_0}$. A simplified, \"within-bout\" rate is defined as $r_i = \\frac{E_i}{T_i}$. We must analyze the relationship between the rankings produced by these two metrics.\n\nFirst, we address the case where the overhead time $T_0$ is negligible. The condition $T_0/T_i \\to 0$ is formally interpreted as the limit $T_0 \\to 0^+$. The rate function $R_i(T_0)$ is a rational function of $T_0$. Since the problem implies physically meaningful parameters, we must have $T_i > 0$, and therefore the denominator $T_i + T_0$ is never zero for $T_0 \\ge 0$. This ensures that $R_i(T_0)$ is continuous on the domain $[0, \\infty)$.\n\nBy the property of continuity, the limit of $R_i(T_0)$ as $T_0$ approaches $0$ can be evaluated by direct substitution:\n$$ \\lim_{T_0 \\to 0^+} R_i(T_0) = \\frac{E_i}{T_i + 0} = \\frac{E_i}{T_i} = r_i $$\nThe problem states that we must have $E_1/T_1 \\neq E_2/T_2$, which means $r_1 \\neq r_2$. Without loss of generality, let us assume $r_1 > r_2$. We wish to show that for sufficiently small positive $T_0$, it is also true that $R_1(T_0) > R_2(T_0)$. To do this, we examine the difference function $\\Delta R(T_0) = R_1(T_0) - R_2(T_0)$. As the difference of two continuous functions, $\\Delta R(T_0)$ is itself continuous for $T_0 \\ge 0$. Its limit as $T_0 \\to 0^+$ is:\n$$ \\lim_{T_0 \\to 0^+} \\Delta R(T_0) = \\lim_{T_0 \\to 0^+} R_1(T_0) - \\lim_{T_0 \\to 0^+} R_2(T_0) = r_1 - r_2 $$\nGiven our assumption $r_1 > r_2$, the limit $r_1 - r_2$ is a positive constant. By the definition of a limit and the properties of continuous functions, if a function approaches a positive limit at a point, there must exist a neighborhood around that point where the function itself is positive. Therefore, there exists a value $\\delta > 0$ such that for all $T_0 \\in (0, \\delta)$, we have $\\Delta R(T_0) > 0$, which implies $R_1(T_0) > R_2(T_0)$. This confirms that for a negligible overhead time, the strict ordering of options based on the long-run rate $R_i$ is identical to the ordering based on the within-bout rate $r_i$.\n\nNext, we demonstrate that this ordering can reverse for a sufficiently large $T_0$ and derive the specific time $T_0^{\\ast}$ at which the rates are equal. Let us examine the behavior of $R_i(T_0)$ as $T_0 \\to \\infty$. We can write $R_i(T_0) = \\frac{E_i}{T_0(1+T_i/T_0)}$. For very large $T_0$, the term $T_i/T_0$ becomes negligible, and the rate is approximated by $R_i(T_0) \\approx \\frac{E_i}{T_0}$. In this regime, a comparison between $R_1(T_0)$ and $R_2(T_0)$ is approximately a comparison between $\\frac{E_1}{T_0}$ and $\\frac{E_2}{T_0}$, which simplifies to a comparison between $E_1$ and $E_2$.\nA reversal of ranking is thus possible if the ordering by $r_i$ is contrary to the ordering by $E_i$. For instance, if $r_1 > r_2$ but $E_1 < E_2$, then option $1$ is superior for small $T_0$, while option $2$ becomes superior for large $T_0$. Due to the continuity of the rate functions, there must be an intermediate point $T_0^{\\ast}$ where the preferences are equal.\nThis critical overhead time, $T_0^{\\ast}$, is defined by the equality $R_1(T_0^{\\ast}) = R_2(T_0^{\\ast})$. We solve this equation from first principles:\n$$ \\frac{E_1}{T_1 + T_0^{\\ast}} = \\frac{E_2}{T_2 + T_0^{\\ast}} $$\nProvided that the denominators are non-zero, which they are for $T_0^{\\ast} \\ge 0$, we can cross-multiply:\n$$ E_1(T_2 + T_0^{\\ast}) = E_2(T_1 + T_0^{\\ast}) $$\n$$ E_1 T_2 + E_1 T_0^{\\ast} = E_2 T_1 + E_2 T_0^{\\ast} $$\nWe rearrange the equation to isolate $T_0^{\\ast}$:\n$$ E_1 T_2 - E_2 T_1 = E_2 T_0^{\\ast} - E_1 T_0^{\\ast} $$\n$$ E_1 T_2 - E_2 T_1 = T_0^{\\ast} (E_2 - E_1) $$\nAssuming $E_1 \\neq E_2$, we can solve for $T_0^{\\ast}$:\n$$ T_0^{\\ast} = \\frac{E_1 T_2 - E_2 T_1}{E_2 - E_1} $$\nA physically meaningful reversal point requires $T_0^{\\ast} > 0$. This condition is met if the numerator and denominator have the same sign. This is equivalent to requiring $(\\frac{E_1}{T_1} > \\frac{E_2}{T_2} \\text{ and } E_1 < E_2)$ or $(\\frac{E_1}{T_1} < \\frac{E_2}{T_2} \\text{ and } E_1 > E_2)$, which confirms our earlier reasoning that a reversal occurs if and only if the option with the higher within-bout rate has the lower absolute energy gain.\n\nFinally, we apply this formula to the provided numerical case: $E_1=100\\,\\text{kJ}$, $T_1=1\\,\\text{h}$, $E_2=140\\,\\text{kJ}$, and $T_2=2\\,\\text{h}$.\nFirst, we calculate the within-bout rates:\n$$ r_1 = \\frac{E_1}{T_1} = \\frac{100}{1} = 100\\,\\text{kJ/h} $$\n$$ r_2 = \\frac{E_2}{T_2} = \\frac{140}{2} = 70\\,\\text{kJ/h} $$\nWe observe that $r_1 > r_2$.\nNext, we compare the total energy gains:\n$$ E_1 = 100\\,\\text{kJ} < E_2 = 140\\,\\text{kJ} $$\nThe condition for rank reversal is met. We can now compute the critical overhead time $T_0^{\\ast}$ using our derived expression.

Here, the forager's decision is not just about maximizing the average rate, but about immediate survival, a concept known as risk-sensitive foraging.

Survival to the next period requires that post-foraging reserves satisfy $R + G \\ge c$, where $G$ is the total energetic gain obtained within the window. Encounters are sequential, handling is exclusive (no searching during handling), and the time to the next encounter of any given prey type is exponentially distributed, consistent with a Poisson search process. The predator’s objective is to maximize expected fitness defined as the probability of survival to the next period times the continuation value, and when the state is near the survival threshold (i.e., $R$ is close to $c$), survival dominates the continuation value. The dynamic decision problem can be written with a value function $V(R,t)$ over remaining time $t$, with a terminal condition $V(R,0) = \\mathbf{1}\\{R \\ge c\\}$, where $\\mathbf{1}\\{\\cdot\\}$ is the indicator function.\n\nAt time $t=0$, the predator has just encountered a single prey item of type $L$ (low profitability) with energy content $e_L$ and handling time $h_L$. If it rejects $L$, it will search for prey type $H$ (high profitability) that arrives as a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda_H$; the energy and handling time of $H$ are $e_H$ and $h_H$, respectively.

Both models reject $L$ because its profitability is lower than that of $H$, and reserves do not alter optimal diet breadth under any optimality principle.\n\nC.
