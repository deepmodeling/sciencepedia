Assume each community represents an equal share of the affected population. Using the definition of the Lorenz curve $L(p)$ as the cumulative share of total benefits received by the bottom fraction $p \\in [0,1]$ of the communities (ordered by nondecreasing benefits), and the definition of the Gini coefficient $G$ as twice the area between the line of equality and the Lorenz curve, compute $G$ starting from these fundamental definitions. Construct the Lorenz curve for this discrete case, evaluate the relevant area exactly, and then briefly interpret the resulting $G$ in terms of distributive justice in conservation (fairness of benefit allocation among communities). Express the Gini coefficient as a decimal and round your final numerical answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The task is to compute the Gini coefficient, $G$, for a given discrete distribution of benefits among $N=5$ communities. The benefit allocation vector is given as $b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 10]$.\n\nFirst, we must order the communities by non-decreasing benefits. The given vector is already ordered, so we can denote the benefits for each community $i$ as $b_i$, where $b_1=1$, $b_2=2$, $b_3=3$, $b_4=4$, and $b_5=10$.\n\nThe total amount of benefits is the sum of the individual allocations:\n$$B_{total} = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} b_i = 1+2+3+4+10 = 20$$\n\nThe Lorenz curve, $L(p)$, plots the cumulative share of benefits received by the bottom fraction $p$ of the population. Since the $N=5$ communities are assumed to be equally sized, each represents a fraction $1/N = 1/5 = 0.2$ of the total population. The cumulative population fractions are $p_k = k/N$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. The corresponding cumulative benefit shares, $L(p_k)$, are calculated as the ratio of the cumulative sum of benefits for the bottom $k$ communities to the total benefits.\n\nThe points $(p_k, L(p_k))$ that define the Lorenz curve are:\nFor $k=0$: $p_0 = 0/5 = 0$. The cumulative benefit is $0$. Thus, $L(p_0) = 0/20 = 0$. The first point is $(0, 0)$.\nFor $k=1$: $p_1 = 1/5 = 0.2$. Cml. benefit is $b_1=1$. Thus, $L(p_1) = 1/20 = 0.05$. The point is $(0.2, 0.05)$.\nFor $k=2$: $p_2 = 2/5 = 0.4$. Cml. benefit is $b_1+b_2=1+2=3$. Thus, $L(p_2) = 3/20 = 0.15$. The point is $(0.4, 0.15)$.\nFor $k=3$: $p_3 = 3/5 = 0.6$. Cml. benefit is $b_1+b_2+b_3=1+2+3=6$. Thus, $L(p_3) = 6/20 = 0.30$. The point is $(0.6, 0.30)$.\nFor $k=4$: $p_4 = 4/5 = 0.8$. Cml. benefit is $b_1+b_2+b_3+b_4=1+2+3+4=10$. Thus, $L(p_4) = 10/20 = 0.50$. The point is $(0.8, 0.50)$.\nFor $k=5$: $p_5 = 5/5 = 1.0$. Cml. benefit is $B_{total}=20$. Thus, $L(p_5) = 20/20 = 1.00$. The point is $(1.0, 1.0)$.\n\nThe Lorenz curve for this discrete case is a piecewise linear function connecting these six points in sequence.\n\nThe Gini coefficient, $G$, is defined as twice the area between the line of perfect equality, $y=p$, and the Lorenz curve, $L(p)$.\n$$G = 2 \\times A$$\nwhere $A$ is the area defined by the integral:\n$$A = \\int_{0}^{1} [p - L(p)] \\,dp$$\nThis can be computed as the area under the line of equality minus the area under the Lorenz curve:\n$$A = \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} p \\,dp \\right) - \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} L(p) \\,dp \\right)$$\nThe area under the line of equality from $p=0$ to $p=1$ is the area of a right triangle with base $1$ and height $1$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{1} p \\,dp = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times 1 = 0.5$$\nThe area under the piecewise linear Lorenz curve, $A_L = \\int_{0}^{1} L(p) \\,dp$, is calculated by summing the areas of the trapezoids formed by the points $(p_{k-1}, L(p_{k-1}))$ and $(p_k, L(p_k))$.

A value of $G=0.4000$ indicates a moderate level of inequality. In the context of distributive justice, it quantifies the deviation from a perfectly fair allocation, where each community would receive $B_{total}/N = 20/5 = 4$ units of benefit. The existing allocation is unjust to the extent measured by this coefficient; the bottom $20\\%$ of communities receive only $5\\%$ of the total benefit, whereas the top $20\\%$ receives $50\\%$ of the benefit.

Assume there are equal numbers of households in each quintile, indexed by $q \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ from the lowest-income quintile ($q=1$) to the highest-income quintile ($q=5$). Let the annual aggregate benefit vector across quintiles be $\\mathbf{B} = [100, 50, 30, 20, 10]$ and the annual aggregate cost vector across quintiles be $\\mathbf{C} = [30, 30, 30, 30, 30]$, measured in the same monetary unit for benefits and costs and already expressed as totals per quintile.\n\nTo reflect environmental justice concerns in conservation appraisal, suppose the planner adopts distributional weights that differentially scale welfare changes for the lowest-income quintile relative to others. Specifically, benefits accruing to the lowest-income quintile are given twice the social value of benefits accruing to any other quintile, and costs borne by the lowest-income quintile are given three times the social disvalue of costs borne by any other quintile. All other quintiles are weighted equally to each other for both benefits and costs.\n\nStarting from a utilitarian social welfare function $W = \\sum_{i} U(y_i + \\Delta b_i - \\Delta c_i)$ over individuals $i$, where $U(\\cdot)$ is increasing and concave and $\\Delta b_i$ and $\\Delta c_i$ are small project-induced changes, justify the linear equity-weighting of aggregate benefits and costs at the quintile level by first-order approximation, and then compute the equity-adjusted benefit-cost ratio, defined as the ratio of equity-weighted total benefits to equity-weighted total costs, using the weights described above. Express the final ratio as a dimensionless decimal rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "**Part 1: Justification of Linear Equity-Weighting**\n\nThe social welfare function is given as $W = \\sum_{i} U(y_i)$, where the sum is over all individuals $i$ in the society and $y_i$ is the income (or consumption) of individual $i$. The function $U(\\cdot)$ is increasing ($U' > 0$) and strictly concave ($U''  0$).\n\nA project induces small changes in individual welfare, denoted by $\\Delta b_i$ (benefits) and $\\Delta c_i$ (costs). The post-project income for individual $i$ is $y_i + \\Delta b_i - \\Delta c_i$. The change in social welfare, $\\Delta W$, is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta W = \\sum_{i} U(y_i + \\Delta b_i - \\Delta c_i) - \\sum_{i} U(y_i)\n$$\nLet the net change in income for individual $i$ be $\\Delta y_i = \\Delta b_i - \\Delta c_i$. Since these changes are assumed to be small, we can use a first-order Taylor series expansion for $U(y_i + \\Delta y_i)$ around $y_i$:\n$$\nU(y_i + \\Delta y_i) \\approx U(y_i) + U'(y_i) \\Delta y_i\n$$\nwhere $U'(y_i)$ is the first derivative of the utility function evaluated at $y_i$, representing the marginal utility of income for individual $i$.\n\nSubstituting this approximation into the expression for $\\Delta W$:\n$$\n\\Delta W \\approx \\sum_{i} \\left[ U(y_i) + U'(y_i) \\Delta y_i \\right] - \\sum_{i} U(y_i)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta W \\approx \\sum_{i} U'(y_i) \\Delta y_i = \\sum_{i} U'(y_i) (\\Delta b_i - \\Delta c_i)\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the change in social welfare is approximately a weighted sum of the net benefits to each individual, where the weight for individual $i$ is their marginal utility of income, $U'(y_i)$.\n\nThe concavity of $U(\\cdot)$ implies that its first derivative, $U'(\\cdot)$, is a decreasing function. Therefore, individuals with lower income have a higher marginal utility of income. This provides the theoretical foundation for applying higher weights to benefits and costs affecting lower-income individuals.\n\nTo move from an individual to a group level (income quintiles), we aggregate. Let $I_q$ denote the set of individuals in quintile $q$. The expression for $\\Delta W$ can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\Delta W \\approx \\sum_{q=1}^{5} \\sum_{i \\in I_q} U'(y_i) (\\Delta b_i - \\Delta c_i)\n$$\nA standard simplifying assumption in this type of analysis is that all individuals within a given quintile $q$ have approximately the same income level, $y_q$, and thus the same marginal utility of income, $U'(y_q)$. Applying this simplification:\n$$\n\\Delta W \\approx \\sum_{q=1}^{5} U'(y_q) \\sum_{i \\in I_q} (\\Delta b_i - \\Delta c_i)\n$$\nThe inner sum is the aggregate net benefit for quintile $q$, which is $B_q - C_q$.

The problem statement proposes weights that are set by the planner as a policy choice, which is a practical application of this principle. The planner has defined distinct weights for benefits ($\\omega_q^B$) and costs ($\\omega_q^C$), leading to the following form for the project's net social benefit:\n$$\n\\text{Net Social Benefit} = \\sum_{q=1}^{5} (\\omega_q^B B_q - \\omega_q^C C_q)\n$$\nThis structure is a direct implementation of linear equity-weighting at the quintile level, justified by the first-order approximation of the change in a utilitarian social welfare function with a concave utility of income.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of the Equity-Adjusted Benefit-Cost Ratio**\n\nThe distributional weights must be normalized.
