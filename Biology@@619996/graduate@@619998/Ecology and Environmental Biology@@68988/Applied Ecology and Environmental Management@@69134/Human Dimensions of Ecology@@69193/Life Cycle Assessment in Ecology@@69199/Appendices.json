The Functional Unit (FU) is $1$ kilogram of raw milk at farm gate.

We are required to compute the climate change impact per FU under three different co-product handling methods.\n\n1.  **Mass Allocation**\n    In attributional LCA, allocation partitions the total environmental burden, $E_{total}$, among the co-products based on a physical property. For mass allocation, the partitioning is based on the mass of the products.\n    The total mass of co-products is $M_{total} = M_{milk} + M_{beef}$.\n    The allocation factor for milk, $AF_{milk, mass}$, is the ratio of the mass of milk to the total mass of co-products:\n    $$AF_{milk, mass} = \\frac{M_{milk}}{M_{milk} + M_{beef}}$$\n    The total emissions allocated to the entire milk output is $E_{milk, mass} = E_{total} \\times AF_{milk, mass}$.\n    The climate change intensity per FU, $I_{milk, mass}$, is the total allocated emissions divided by the total mass of milk produced:\n    $$I_{milk, mass} = \\frac{E_{milk, mass}}{M_{milk}} = \\frac{E_{total} \\times \\frac{M_{milk}}{M_{milk} + M_{beef}}}{M_{milk}} = \\frac{E_{total}}{M_{milk} + M_{beef}}$$\n    Substituting the given numerical values:\n    $$I_{milk, mass} = \\frac{7.2 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ kg CO}_2\\text{e}}{5.4 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ kg} + 1.77 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ kg}} = \\frac{7.2 \\times 10^{6}}{5.577 \\times 10^{6}} \\frac{\\text{kg CO}_2\\text{e}}{\\text{kg}} \\approx 1.29101667 \\frac{\\text{kg CO}_2\\text{e}}{\\text{kg milk}}$$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, the result is $1.291$ kg CO$_2$e/kg milk.\n\n2.  **Economic Allocation**\n    For economic allocation, the partitioning is based on the relative market value of the co-products.\n    The total economic value (revenue) is $V_{total} = (M_{milk} \\times P_{milk}) + (M_{beef} \\times P_{beef})$.\n    The allocation factor for milk, $AF_{milk, econ}$, is the ratio of the revenue from milk to the total revenue:\n    $$AF_{milk, econ} = \\frac{M_{milk} \\times P_{milk}}{(M_{milk} \\times P_{milk}) + (M_{beef} \\times P_{beef})}$$\n    The total emissions allocated to the milk output is $E_{milk, econ} = E_{total} \\times AF_{milk, econ}$.\n    The climate change intensity per FU, $I_{milk, econ}$, is:\n    $$I_{milk, econ} = \\frac{E_{milk, econ}}{M_{milk}} = \\frac{E_{total}}{M_{milk}} \\times \\frac{M_{milk} \\times P_{milk}}{(M_{milk} \\times P_{milk}) + (M_{beef} \\times P_{beef})}$$\n    First, we calculate the economic values:\n    - Revenue from milk: $V_{milk} = (5.4 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ kg}) \\times (\\$0.45/\\text{kg}) = \\$2.43 \\times 10^{6}$.\n    - Revenue from beef: $V_{beef} = (1.77 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ kg}) \\times (\\$2.20/\\text{kg}) = \\$3.894 \\times 10^{5}$.\n    - Total revenue: $V_{total} = \\$2.43 \\times 10^{6} + \\$3.894 \\times 10^{5} = \\$2.8194 \\times 10^{6}$.\n    Now, substitute these into the expression for $I_{milk, econ}$:\n    $$I_{milk, econ} = \\frac{7.2 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ kg CO}_2\\text{e}}{5.4 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ kg}} \\times \\frac{\\$2.43 \\times 10^{6}}{\\$2.8194 \\times 10^{6}} \\approx 1.3333... \\times 0.861878... \\frac{\\text{kg CO}_2\\text{e}}{\\text{kg milk}} \\approx 1.1491712 \\frac{\\text{kg CO}_2\\text{e}}{\\text{kg milk}}$$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, the result is $1.149$ kg CO$_2$e/kg milk.\n\n3.  **System Expansion with Substitution**\n    This consequential LCA approach avoids allocation by expanding the system boundary. The burden of the multifunctional system is credited with the impacts that are avoided by providing the co-product, which displaces an alternative, single-function process.\n    The production of $M_{beef}$ from the dairy system displaces dedicated beef production. The avoided emissions, $E_{avoided}$, are calculated as:\n    $$E_{avoided} = M_{beef} \\times I_{disp\\_beef}$$\n    The net emissions of the expanded system, which now exclusively produces milk as its function, are the total emissions minus the avoided emissions:\n    $$E_{net} = E_{total} - E_{avoided} = E_{total} - (M_{beef} \\times I_{disp\\_beef})$$\n    The climate change intensity of milk under this method, $I_{milk, sys\\_exp}$, is the net emissions divided by the total mass of milk:\n    $$I_{milk, sys\\_exp} = \\frac{E_{net}}{M_{milk}} = \\frac{E_{total} - (M_{beef} \\times I_{disp\\_beef})}{M_{milk}}$$\n    Substituting the given numerical values:\n    $$E_{avoided} = (1.77 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ kg}) \\times (18 \\frac{\\text{kg CO}_2\\text{e}}{\\text{kg}}) = 3.186 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ kg CO}_2\\text{e}$$\n    $$E_{net} = 7.2 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ kg CO}_2\\text{e} - 3.186 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ kg CO}_2\\text{e} = 4.014 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ kg CO}_2\\text{e}$$\n    $$I_{milk, sys\\_exp} = \\frac{4.014 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ kg CO}_2\\text{e}}{5.4 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ kg}} = 0.74333... \\frac{\\text{kg CO}_2\\text{e}}{\\text{kg milk}}$$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, the result is $0.7433$ kg CO$_2$e/kg milk.\n\nThe three calculated values for the climate change intensity of $1$ kg of milk are: $1.291$ (mass allocation), $1.149$ (economic allocation), and $0.7433$ (system expansion).
