The problem is well-posed; it provides all necessary information ($p$, a target probability of $0.9$) and constraints ($k$ is an integer) to find a unique minimum value for $k$. The language is objective and precise. The problem is a straightforward application of elementary probability theory to a realistic scenario in environmental science. It is not incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, or ill-posed.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nLet us define the events for a site where the species is known to be present.\nLet $D_i$ be the event that the species is detected during the $i$-th survey, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, k\\}$.\nThe problem states that the probability of this event is $P(D_i) = p$.\n\nThe complement event, $D_i^c$, is the event that the species is *not* detected during the $i$-th survey. By the complement rule of probability theory, its probability is:\n$$ P(D_i^c) = 1 - P(D_i) = 1 - p $$\n\nThe objective is to find the minimum number of surveys, $k$, such that the probability of detecting the species at least once is at least $0.9$. Let $A$ be the event of detecting the species at least once in $k$ surveys. This can be expressed as the union of the individual detection events:\n$$ A = D_1 \\cup D_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup D_k $$\n\nCalculating $P(A)$ directly using the principle of inclusion-exclusion is unnecessarily complex. It is more efficient to consider the complement event, $A^c$. The event $A^c$ is that the species is *not* detected in *any* of the $k$ surveys. This corresponds to the intersection of the individual non-detection events:\n$$ A^c = D_1^c \\cap D_2^c \\cap \\dots \\cap D_k^c $$\n\nThe problem statement specifies that the survey visits are independent events. Therefore, we can apply the multiplication rule for independent events to calculate the probability of $A^c$:\n$$ P(A^c) = P(D_1^c) \\times P(D_2^c) \\times \\dots \\times P(D_k^c) $$\nSince $P(D_i^c) = 1 - p$ for all $i$, this simplifies to:\n$$ P(A^c) = (1 - p)^k $$\n\nNow, we can find the probability of our event of interest, $A$, by applying the complement rule once more:\n$$ P(A) = 1 - P(A^c) = 1 - (1 - p)^k $$\n\nThe monitoring objective requires this probability to be at least $0.9$. This gives us the following inequality:\n$$ 1 - (1-p)^k \\ge 0.9 $$\n\nWe must now solve this inequality for $k$.\n$$ 1 - 0.9 \\ge (1 - p)^k $$\n$$ 0.1 \\ge (1 - p)^k $$\n\nTo isolate $k$, we take the natural logarithm, $\\ln$, of both sides.\n$$ \\ln(0.1) \\ge \\ln((1 - p)^k) $$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(x^y) = y \\ln(x)$, we get:\n$$ \\ln(0.1) \\ge k \\ln(1 - p) $$\n\nTo solve for $k$, we must divide by $\\ln(1-p)$. It is given that $p \\in (0,1)$, which implies that $0 < 1-p < 1$. The natural logarithm of any number between $0$ and $1$ is negative, so $\\ln(1-p) < 0$. When dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the direction of the inequality sign must be reversed.\n$$ \\frac{\\ln(0.1)}{\\ln(1 - p)} \\le k $$\nThis is equivalent to:\n$$ k \\ge \\frac{\\ln(0.1)}{\\ln(1 - p)} $$\n\nThe problem requires the minimum integer value of $k$ that satisfies this condition. The quantity on the right-hand side is generally not an integer. Therefore, the smallest integer $k$ satisfying the inequality is the ceiling of this expression. The ceiling function, denoted $\\lceil x \\rceil$, gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to $x$.\n\nThus, the minimum number of surveys required, $k$, is:\n$$ k = \\left\\lceil \\frac{\\ln(0.1)}{\\ln(1-p)} \\right\\rceil $$\nThis is the explicit closed-form expression for the minimum integer $k$ as a function of the detection probability $p$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\left\\lceil \\frac{\\ln(0.1)}{\\ln(1-p)} \\right\\rceil} $$", "id": "2468472"}, {"introduction": "Once monitoring data are collected, the central task of an impact assessment is to isolate the effect of an intervention from natural background variation.

At each site-period cell $(s,t)\\in\\{I,C\\}\\times\\{B,A\\}$, there are $n_{s,t}\\geq 1$ independent replicate measurements of a response variable $Y$ (for example, benthic macroinvertebrate density), denoted $Y_{s,t,k}$ for $k\\in\\{1,\\dots,n_{s,t}\\}$.

This is achieved by the difference-in-differences method.\n\nFirst, compute the change over time within the impact site:\n$$\nE[\\bar{Y}_{I,A}] - E[\\bar{Y}_{I,B}] = (\\mu + \\alpha_{I} + \\gamma_{A} + \\tau) - (\\mu + \\alpha_{I} + \\gamma_{B}) = \\gamma_{A} - \\gamma_{B} + \\tau\n$$\nNext, compute the change over time within the control site, which represents the background temporal trend:\n$$\nE[\\bar{Y}_{C,A}] - E[\\bar{Y}_{C,B}] = (\\mu + \\alpha_{C} + \\gamma_{A}) - (\\mu + \\alpha_{C} + \\gamma_{B}) = \\gamma_{A} - \\gamma_{B}\n$$\nThe difference between these two differences yields the causal effect $\\tau$:\n$$\n(E[\\bar{Y}_{I,A}] - E[\\bar{Y}_{I,B}]) - (E[\\bar{Y}_{C,A}] - E[\\bar{Y}_{C,B}]) = (\\gamma_{A} - \\gamma_{B} + \\tau) - (\\gamma_{A} - \\gamma_{B}) = \\tau\n$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, we can write:\n$$\nE[(\\bar{Y}_{I,A} - \\bar{Y}_{I,B}) - (\\bar{Y}_{C,A} - \\bar{Y}_{C,B})] = \\tau\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the following statistic, which we denote $\\hat{\\tau}$, has an expected value of $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau} = (\\bar{Y}_{I,A} - \\bar{Y}_{I,B}) - (\\bar{Y}_{C,A} - \\bar{Y}_{C,B})\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we obtain the final expression for the estimator:\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau} = \\bar{Y}_{I,A} - \\bar{Y}_{I,B} - \\bar{Y}_{C,A} + \\bar{Y}_{C,B}\n$$\nSince $E[\\hat{\\tau}] = \\tau$, this estimator is unbiased for $\\tau$.\n\nNow we state the minimal set of assumptions for unbiasedness and consistency.\n\n**Assumptions for Unbiasedness:**\nThe property $E[\\hat{\\tau}] = \\tau$ holds if the following assumptions are met:\n1.  **Correct Model Specification:** The expected value of the response variable must conform to the additive structure presented in the problem: $E[Y_{s,t,k}] = \\mu + \\alpha_s + \\gamma_t + \\tau\\cdot\\mathbf{1}\\{s=I,t=A\\}$. This is the crucial \"parallel trends\" assumption, which posits that, in the absence of the impact, the temporal trend at the impact site would have been identical to the temporal trend at the control site. Any violation of this additive separability (e.g., an interaction between site and time unrelated to the impact) will typically bias the estimator.\n2.  **Zero-Mean Errors:** The expectation of the error term for any observation must be zero, $E[\\varepsilon_{s,t,k}]=0$. This is explicitly provided in the problem statement. The exogeneity assumption that the errors are independent of site-period assignment is also implicit in this formulation for $\\tau$ to be interpreted as a causal effect.\n\n**Assumptions for Consistency:**\nAn estimator is consistent if it converges in probability to the true parameter value as the sample size approaches infinity. For $\\hat{\\tau}$ to be consistent for $\\tau$ as all $n_{s,t} \\to \\infty$, we require:\n1.  **All assumptions for unbiasedness must hold.** Consistency requires the estimator to converge to the correct value, so it must be unbiased to begin with.\n2.  **Law of Large Numbers:** The conditions for the Law of Large Numbers (LLN) must apply to the sample mean of each cell. The problem statement provides that the replicate measurements are independent and the errors $\\varepsilon_{s,t,k}$ have finite variance. This is sufficient for the Weak LLN to hold, ensuring that each cell mean $\\bar{Y}_{s,t}$ converges in probability to its expectation $E[\\bar{Y}_{s,t}]$ as its sample size $n_{s,t} \\to \\infty$.\n3.  **Diverging Sample Sizes:** The number of replicate samples in all four cells must tend to infinity: $n_{I,A} \\to \\infty$, $n_{I,B} \\to \\infty$, $n_{C,A} \\to \\infty$, and $n_{C,B} \\to \\infty$.\n\nUnder these conditions, each $\\bar{Y}_{s,t}$ converges to its expected value.

The problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. A minor imprecision in the phrasing \"inflates the observed variance\" is noted, but this is a subtlety that can be addressed within a correct derivation rather than a fundamental flaw that invalidates the problem.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe core of the problem is a power analysis for a two-sample test of proportions, where the proportions are themselves subject to observation error. We must first relate the observed quantities to the true, latent quantities.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the observed probability of detection, $\\mu_t = \\mathbb{P}(Y_{it}=1)$, and the true occupancy probability, $\\pi_t = \\mathbb{P}(T_{it}=1)$. Using the provided law of total probability and definitions:\n$$\n\\mu_t = \\mathbb{P}(Y_{it}=1 \\mid T_{it}=1)\\mathbb{P}(T_{it}=1) + \\mathbb{P}(Y_{it}=1 \\mid T_{it}=0)\\mathbb{P}(T_{it}=0)\n$$\nSubstituting the given symbols $p$, $q$, and $\\pi_t$:\n$$\n\\mu_t = p \\cdot \\pi_t + q \\cdot (1 - \\pi_t) = p \\pi_t + q - q \\pi_t = (p-q)\\pi_t + q\n$$\nThis equation provides a linear mapping from the true state probability $\\pi_t$ to the mean of the observed data $\\mu_t$.\n\nSecond, we analyze how the difference in true occupancy, $\\Delta\\pi = \\pi_1 - \\pi_0$, relates to the difference in observed mean detection rates, $\\Delta\\mu = \\mu_1 - \\mu_0$.\n$$\n\\Delta\\mu = \\mu_1 - \\mu_0 = ((p-q)\\pi_1 + q) - ((p-q)\\pi_0 + q) = (p-q)(\\pi_1 - \\pi_0) = (p-q)\\Delta\\pi\n$$\nThis result explicitly demonstrates the attenuation of the effect size. Since detection is imperfect, $p < 1$, and false positives occur, $q > 0$, the factor $(p-q)$ is strictly less than $1$. The observed difference in means $\\Delta\\mu$ is a fraction of the true difference in occupancy probabilities $\\Delta\\pi$.\n\nThird, we examine the variance of the observed data. The sample mean for a given time period $t$ is $\\bar{Y}_t = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_{it}$. Since the $Y_{it}$ are independent Bernoulli trials with mean $\\mu_t$, the variance of the sample mean is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{Y}_t) = \\frac{\\mu_t(1-\\mu_t)}{n}\n$$\nThe test for the difference in means uses the standard error of the difference, $SE_D = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{Y}_1 - \\bar{Y}_0)}$. Assuming independence between the pre- and post-action surveys, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{Y}_1 - \\bar{Y}_0) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{Y}_1) + \\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{Y}_0)$. For the power calculation, we are instructed to use the pre-action variance as an approximation for the post-action variance. This yields a standard error based solely on pre-action parameters:\n$$\nSE_D \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_0(1-\\mu_0)}{n} + \\frac{\\mu_0(1-\\mu_0)}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\mu_0(1-\\mu_0)}{n}}\n$$\nThe problem statement suggests that misclassification \"inflates the observed variance\". This is not universally true. The variance of the Bernoulli process is maximized when its parameter is $0.5$. The observed parameter is $\\mu_0 = (p-q)\\pi_0 + q$. Let us calculate the true and observed variances for the given parameters.\nTrue-state variance component: $\\pi_0(1-\\pi_0) = 0.4(1-0.4) = 0.24$.\nObserved-state parameter: $\\mu_0 = (0.7-0.05)(0.4) + 0.05 = (0.65)(0.4) + 0.05 = 0.26 + 0.05 = 0.31$.\nObserved-state variance component: $\\mu_0(1-\\mu_0) = 0.31(1-0.31) = 0.31(0.69) = 0.2139$.\nIn this specific case, $\\mu_0(1-\\mu_0) < \\pi_0(1-\\pi_0)$, so the variance of the observable random variable is actually smaller than that of the latent true state variable. The effect of observation error on variance depends on whether the transformation $\\pi \\mapsto (p-q)\\pi+q$ moves the parameter closer to or further from $0.5$. Irrespective of this specific detail, the combination of signal attenuation and modified variance determines the overall loss of statistical power.\n\nFourth, we formulate the power requirement. For a two-sided test of the difference of means at significance level $\\alpha$, against a specific alternative hypothesis where the true difference is $\\Delta\\mu$, the power $1-\\beta$ is given by the standard formula relating the effect size to the critical values of the standard normal distribution, $z_{\\alpha/2}$ and $z_{\\beta}$:\n$$\n|\\Delta\\mu| = (z_{\\alpha/2} + z_{\\beta}) SE_D\n$$\nThis equation states that the detectable difference in means must be large enough to span the distance from the null hypothesis mean ($0$) to the rejection threshold ($z_{\\alpha/2} SE_D$) plus the distance from the alternative hypothesis mean ($\\Delta\\mu$) to the threshold for achieving power $1-\\beta$ (which is $-z_{\\beta} SE_D$).\n\nFifth, we combine these pieces to derive the expression for the minimal detectable true change, $\\Delta\\pi_{\\min}$. We substitute our expressions for $\\Delta\\mu$ and $SE_D$ into the power equation:\n$$\n|(p-q)\\Delta\\pi_{\\min}| = (z_{\\alpha/2} + z_{\\beta}) \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\mu_0(1-\\mu_0)}{n}}\n$$\nSince we are interested in a positive change, $\\Delta\\pi_{\\min} > 0$, and typically $p > q$, we can remove the absolute value signs.\n$$\n\\Delta\\pi_{\\min} = \\frac{z_{\\alpha/2} + z_{\\beta}}{p-q} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\mu_0(1-\\mu_0)}{n}}\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the minimum detectable true change in occupancy. It clearly shows the two main consequences of imperfect detection: the true effect size is amplified by the factor $1/(p-q)$ to compensate for signal attenuation, and the standard error term is calculated using the observed parameter $\\mu_0$ instead of the true parameter $\\pi_0$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value for $\\Delta\\pi_{\\min}$ using the given data.\n-   $n = 200$.\n-   $\\pi_0 = 0.4$.\n-   $p = 0.7$.\n-   $q = 0.05$.\n-   $p-q = 0.65$.\n-   $\\mu_0 = (0.65)(0.4) + 0.05 = 0.31$.\n-   $\\mu_0(1-\\mu_0) = 0.31(0.69) = 0.2139$.\n-   $\\alpha = 0.05 \\implies z_{\\alpha/2} = z_{0.025} \\approx 1.95996$.\n-   $1-\\beta = 0.8 \\implies \\beta = 0.2 \\implies z_{\\beta} = z_{0.2} \\approx 0.84162$.\n-   $z_{\\alpha/2} + z_{\\beta} \\approx 1.95996 + 0.84162 = 2.80158$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\n\\Delta\\pi_{\\min} = \\frac{2.80158}{0.65} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 0.2139}{200}} = \\frac{2.80158}{0.65} \\sqrt{\\frac{0.4278}{200}} = \\frac{2.80158}{0.65} \\sqrt{0.002139}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\pi_{\\min} \\approx \\frac{2.80158}{0.65} \\times 0.0462493 \\approx 4.31012 \\times 0.0462493 \\approx 0.19932\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the minimal detectable true change in occupancy is $0.1993$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0.1993} $$", "id": "2468508"}]}
