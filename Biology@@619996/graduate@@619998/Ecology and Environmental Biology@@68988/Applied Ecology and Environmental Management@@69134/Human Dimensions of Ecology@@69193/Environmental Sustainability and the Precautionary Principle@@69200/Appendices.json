Express your final answer in dollars. You do not need to round.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound, mathematically well-posed, and objective. It is based on the canonical model for bistability and hysteresis—the cusp catastrophe—which is a fundamental concept in nonlinear dynamics. We will proceed to derive the solution from first principles.\n\nThe system's state, $x$, evolves according to the gradient flow $\\dot{x} = -\\frac{dV}{dx}$ for the potential:\n$$\nV(x;u) = \\frac{x^{4}}{4} - \\frac{x^{2}}{2} + u x\n$$\nEquilibrium states are the critical points of $V(x;u)$, found by setting the first derivative with respect to $x$ to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dx} = x^{3} - x + u = 0\n$$\nThis equation describes the manifold of equilibria in the $(x, u)$ plane.\n\nThe stability of an equilibrium point is determined by the sign of the second derivative, $\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2}$. An equilibrium is stable if $\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} > 0$ and unstable if $\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} < 0$.\n$$\n\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = 3x^{2} - 1\n$$\nFold (saddle-node) bifurcations occur when an equilibrium point is degenerate, meaning both the first and second derivatives of the potential are simultaneously zero. These points mark the boundary of the bistable region.\n$$\n\\begin{cases} x^{3} - x + u = 0 \\\\ 3x^{2} - 1 = 0 \\end{cases}\n$$\nFrom the second equation, we find the values of $x$ at which the bifurcations occur: $x_{crit} = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$. Substituting these values into the first equation ($u = x - x^{3}$) gives the corresponding parameter values for the folds.\n\nThe upper fold parameter, which we will denote $u_{upper}$, corresponds to the maximum value of $u$ on the unstable branch and is found using $x_{crit} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$ (note: this is where the lower stable branch disappears as $u$ increases). No, this is incorrect logic. The upper fold is simply the one at the higher value of $u$.\nLet's calculate:\nFor $x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$, the parameter value is $u = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} - (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})^{3} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} - \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{3}}$.\nFor $x = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$, the parameter value is $u = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} - (-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})^{3} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} + \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{3}} = -\\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nTherefore, the fold bifurcations occur at the parameter values $u_{upper} = \\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{3}}$ and $u_{lower} = -\\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nThe problem states the policymaker operates at $u_s$, the upper fold, which implies $u_s = u_{upper} = \\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{3}}$. An infinitesimal overshoot $\\delta \\to 0^{+}$ moves the parameter to $u_s + \\delta$, which is outside the bistable region for that equilibrium branch, causing a catastrophic jump (regime shift) to the other stable state.\n\nTo restore the system to the original desirable state basin, the control parameter $u$ must be manipulated to trace the hysteresis loop. This requires the following path for $u$:\n1.  Decrease $u$ from its post-overshoot value of $u_s + \\delta$ to just below the lower fold, $u_{lower}$. In the limit, we consider the path from $u_s$ to $u_{lower}$.\n2.  Increase $u$ from $u_{lower}$ back to the original operating point, $u_s$.\n\nThe total change in the parameter $u$ for this hysteretic restoration path, as $\\delta \\to 0^{+}$, is the sum of the lengths of the path segments:\n$$\n\\Delta u_{H} = |u_{lower} - u_{s}| + |u_{s} - u_{lower}| = 2(u_s - u_{lower})\n$$\nSince $u_s = u_{upper}$, this is $\\Delta u_{H} = 2(u_{upper} - u_{lower})$. The associated cost is:\n$$\nCost_{Hysteresis} = c \\cdot \\Delta u_{H} = 2c(u_{upper} - u_{lower})\n$$\nFor a hypothetical, perfectly reversible (monostable) system, restoration would simply involve undoing the infinitesimal overshoot, i.e., changing $u$ from $u_s + \\delta$ back to $u_s$. The path length is $\\Delta u_{R} = \\delta$. The cost is:\n$$\nCost_{Reversible} = c \\cdot \\Delta u_{R} = c\\delta\n$$\nThe additional monetary cost attributable solely to hysteresis is the difference between these two costs in the limit $\\delta \\to 0^{+}$:\n$$\nCost_{add} = \\lim_{\\delta \\to 0^{+}} (Cost_{Hysteresis} - Cost_{Reversible}) = \\lim_{\\delta \\to 0^{+}} [2c(u_{upper} - u_{lower}) - c\\delta] = 2c(u_{upper} - u_{lower})\n$$\nWe compute the width of the hysteresis loop in the parameter $u$:\n$$\nu_{upper} - u_{lower} = \\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{3}} - \\left(-\\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{4}{3\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the additional cost for one such event:\n$$\nCost_{add} = 2c \\left(\\frac{4}{3\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{8c}{3\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\nThe problem states that the probability of this overshoot event is $p \\in (0,1)$.

This quantity represents the contribution to the total variance from $X_i$ itself and all of its interactions with other factors. The second term, $\\mathrm{Var}[\\mathrm{E}(Y | X_{\\sim i})]$, is the variance due to the main effects of all factors in $X_{\\sim i}$.\n\nThe total-order Sobol index, $S_{T_i}$, for input $X_i$ is defined as the fraction of total variance caused by $X_i$, including all its interactions.

The elements of these matrices are drawn from the standard uniform distribution $\\mathrm{Unif}(0, 1)$. These are points in the $d$-dimensional unit hypercube.\n\n2.  **Hybrid Matrix Construction**: For each input variable $X_i$ ($i \\in \\{1, \\dots, d\\}$), construct a hybrid matrix $C_i$ of size $N \\times d$. The matrix $C_i$ is formed by taking all columns from matrix $A$, except for the $i$-th column, which is taken from matrix $B$.\n    $$ C_i = (A_{\\cdot, 1}, \\dots, A_{\\cdot, i-1}, B_{\\cdot, i}, A_{\\cdot, i+1}, \\dots, A_{\\cdot, d}) $$\n\n3.  **Model Evaluation**: The unit hypercube samples must be transformed into the physical parameter space according to their specified uniform distributions. A variable $u \\sim \\mathrm{Unif}(0, 1)$ is mapped to $x \\sim \\mathrm{Unif}(x_{\\min}, x_{\\max})$ by $x = x_{\\min} + u(x_{\\max} - x_{\\min})$. Applying this transformation to the columns of $A$ and $C_i$ gives physical sample matrices $A'$ and $C'_i$. We then evaluate the model function $f$ for each row of these matrices, yielding output vectors $y_A = f(A')$ and $y_{C_i} = f(C'_i)$. This requires a total of $N \\times (d+1)$ model evaluations.\n\n4.  **Estimator Derivation**:\n    Let us consider two points in the input space, $x = (x_i, x_{\\sim i})$ and $x' = (x'_i, x_{\\sim i})$, which differ only in the $i$-th component. Let $Y = f(x)$ and $Y' = f(x')$. We have:\n    $$ \\mathrm{E}[(Y - Y')^2 \\mid X_{\\sim i}=x_{\\sim i}] = \\mathrm{E}[Y^2 \\mid x_{\\sim i}] - 2\\mathrm{E}[Y \\mid x_{\\sim i}]\\mathrm{E}[Y' \\mid x_{\\sim i}] + \\mathrm{E}[(Y')^2 \\mid x_{\\sim i}] $$\n    Since $X_i$ and $X'_i$ are independent and identically distributed, $\\mathrm{E}[Y \\mid x_{\\sim i}] = \\mathrm{E}[Y' \\mid x_{\\sim i}]$ and $\\mathrm{E}[Y^2 \\mid x_{\\sim i}] = \\mathrm{E}[(Y')^2 \\mid x_{\\sim i}]$. Thus,\n    $$ \\mathrm{E}[(Y - Y')^2 \\mid X_{\\sim i}=x_{\\sim i}] = 2(\\mathrm{E}[Y^2 \\mid x_{\\sim i}] - (\\mathrm{E}[Y \\mid x_{\\sim i}])^2) = 2 \\mathrm{Var}(Y \\mid X_{\\sim i}=x_{\\sim i}) $$\n    Taking the expectation over all $x_{\\sim i}$ gives:\n    $$ \\mathrm{E}[(Y-Y')^2] = 2 \\mathrm{E}[\\mathrm{Var}(Y \\mid X_{\\sim i})] = 2 V_{T_i} $$\n    A Monte Carlo estimator for $V_{T_i}$ is therefore:\n    $$ \\hat{V}_{T_i} = \\frac{1}{2N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} (y_{A, j} - y_{C_i, j})^2 $$\n    where $y_{A, j}$ and $y_{C_i, j}$ are the model outputs for the $j$-th rows of matrices $A'$ and $C'_i$, respectively. These two input points share the same values for $X_{\\sim i}$ (from the $j$-th row of $A$) and have independent values for $X_i$ (from the $j$-th rows of $A$ and $B$). The sample variance of the output, $\\hat{V}_Y$, is estimated using the outputs $y_A$:\n    $$ \\hat{f_0} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} y_{A, j} $$\n    $$ \\hat{V}_Y = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} y_{A, j}^2 - \\hat{f_0}^2 $$\n    The total-order Sobol index is then estimated as:\n    $$ \\hat{S}_{T_i} = \\frac{\\hat{V}_{T_i}}{\\hat{V}_Y} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} (y_{A,j} - y_{C_i,j})^2}{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} y_{A,j}^2 - (\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} y_{A,j})^2} $$\n    If $\\hat{V}_Y = 0$, the output is constant, and all sensitivity indices are defined as $0$.\n\n### Computational Algorithm\nThe solution is implemented as follows:\n1.  Set the global random seed to $s=1729$ for reproducibility.\n2.  Define a vectorized function `compute_f` that calculates the robustness margin $f(\\theta)$ for an entire $N \\times d$ matrix of physical input parameters $\\theta$. This function implements the conditional logic for $B^\\star$.\n3.  Iterate through each test case (A, B, C).\n4.  For each case, define the constants $H$, $\\phi$, $B_{\\min}$ and the parameter bounds $(r_{\\min}, r_{\\max})$, $(K_{\\min}, K_{\\max})$, $(\\sigma_{\\min}, \\sigma_{\\max})$.\n5.  Generate two base sample matrices $A$ and $B$, each of size $N \\times d$, with elements drawn from $\\mathrm{Unif}(0,1)^d$.\n6.  Scale the columns of matrix $A$ to create the physical input matrix $A_{phys}$.\n7.  Evaluate the model on $A_{phys}$ to obtain the output vector $y_A$.\n8.  Calculate the total sample variance $\\hat{V}_Y$ from $y_A$. If $\\hat{V}_Y$ is close to zero, all indices are $0$, and the result for this test case is index $0$ (by tie-breaking rule).\n9.  Loop through each parameter index $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$:\n    a. Construct the hybrid matrix $C$ by copying $A$ and replacing column $i$ with column $i$ from $B$.\n    b. Scale the columns of $C$ to create the physical input matrix $C_{phys}$.\n    c. Evaluate the model on $C_{phys}$ to obtain the output vector $y_C$.\n    d. Calculate the numerator of the total-order index estimator: $\\hat{V}_{T_i} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{mean}((y_A - y_C)^2)$.\n    e. Calculate $\\hat{S}_{T_i} = \\hat{V}_{T_i} / \\hat{V}_Y$.\n10. Determine the index of the largest $\\hat{S}_{T_i}$ value using `numpy.argmax`, which respects the tie-breaking rule of selecting the smallest index.\n11. Collect the resulting indices from all test cases and format them for the final output.\n\nThis procedure is systematically applied to each test case to determine the most influential parameter under different system conditions.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the sensitivity analysis problem for all test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Sampling specifications\n    N = 2000\n    SEED = 1729\n    D = 3  # Number of parameters (r, K, sigma)\n\n    # Test case definitions\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"A\",\n            \"H\": 120.0,\n            \"phi\": 2.0,\n            \"B_min\": 300.0,\n            \"bounds\": np.array([\n                [0.4, 0.8],     # r [year^-1]\n                [800.0, 1200.0], # K [t]\n                [20.0, 60.0]      # sigma [t]\n            ])\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"B\",\n            \"H\": 200.0,\n            \"phi\": 2.0,\n            \"B_min\": 300.0,\n            \"bounds\": np.array([\n                [0.3, 0.5],\n                [800.0, 900.0],\n                [20.0, 60.0]\n            ])\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"C\",\n            \"H\": 0.0,\n            \"phi\": 2.0,\n            \"B_min\": 300.0,\n            \"bounds\": np.array([\n                [0.2, 0.6],\n                [400.0, 600.0],\n                [10.0, 20.0]\n            ])\n        }\n    ]\n    \n    # Initialize the random number generator\n    rng = np.random.default_rng(SEED)\n\n    results = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        H = case[\"H\"]\n        phi = case[\"phi\"]\n        B_min = case[\"B_min\"]\n        bounds = case[\"bounds\"]\n\n        # Generate two independent sample matrices in the unit hypercube\n        A_unit = rng.random((N, D))\n        B_unit = rng.random((N, D))\n\n        # Function to scale samples from unit hypercube to physical bounds\n        def scale_samples(unit_samples, bds):\n            scaled = np.zeros_like(unit_samples)\n            for i in range(D):\n                min_val, max_val = bds[i]\n                scaled[:, i] = unit_samples[:, i] * (max_val - min_val) + min_val\n            return scaled\n\n        # Model function f(theta)\n        def compute_f(theta_matrix):\n            r, K, sigma = theta_matrix[:, 0], theta_matrix[:, 1], theta_matrix[:, 2]\n            \n            # Use np.where for vectorized conditional logic\n            b_star = np.zeros_like(r)\n            \n            # Condition: 4H / (rK) < 1, which is rK > 4H\n            # To avoid division by zero when r or K are zero (not the case here, but good practice).\n            condition = r * K > 4 * H\n\n            # Calculate term only where condition is true to avoid sqrt of negative\n            term = np.zeros_like(r)\n            term[condition] = 1.0 - (4.0 * H) / (r[condition] * K[condition])\n\n            # Calculate B_star\n            b_star[condition] = (K[condition] / 2.0) * (1.0 + np.sqrt(term[condition]))\n            \n            b_pc = b_star - phi * sigma\n            f_theta = b_pc - B_min\n            \n            return f_theta\n\n        # Scale matrix A and evaluate the model\n        A_phys = scale_samples(A_unit, bounds)\n        y_A = compute_f(A_phys)\n\n        # Estimate total variance of the output\n        # Using numpy's variance function (ddof=0 for population variance)\n        var_y = np.var(y_A, ddof=0)\n        \n        # If variance is zero, no parameter has any effect.\n        if np.isclose(var_y, 0.0):\n            results.append(0) # By tie-breaking rule, choose smallest index\n            continue\n\n        S_T = np.zeros(D)\n\n        for i in range(D):\n            # Construct hybrid matrix C_i\n            C_unit = A_unit.copy()\n            C_unit[:, i] = B_unit[:, i]\n            \n            # Scale C_i and evaluate the model\n            C_phys = scale_samples(C_unit, bounds)\n            y_C = compute_f(C_phys)\n\n            # Estimate numerator for total order index S_T_i\n            # V_Ti = E[Var(Y|X_~i)] can be estimated by (1/2N) * sum((y_A - y_C)^2)\n            V_Ti_hat = 0.5 * np.mean((y_A - y_C)**2)\n            \n            # Calculate S_T_i\n            S_T[i] = V_Ti_hat / var_y\n\n        # Find the index of the parameter with the largest total-order index\n        # np.argmax breaks ties by returning the first occurrence (smallest index)\n        largest_index = np.argmax(S_T)\n        results.append(largest_index)\n\n    # Print results in the specified format\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2489218"}]}
