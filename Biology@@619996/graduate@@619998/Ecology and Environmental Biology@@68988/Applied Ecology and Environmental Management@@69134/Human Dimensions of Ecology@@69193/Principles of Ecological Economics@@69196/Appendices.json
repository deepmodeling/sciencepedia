The energy sector operates a single standardized plant per planning period due to binding capital and skilled-labor constraints that allow deployment of exactly one plant. The plant produces a gross primary energy output denoted by $E_{\\text{out}}$ (measured at the plant gate) but requires an internal energy input $E_{\\text{in}}$ (covering extraction, processing, and delivery) drawn from its own gross output to function. The non-energy sector requires energy at a fixed energy intensity $\\varepsilon$ (megajoules per unit of non-energy output), which is invariant to which energy technology is used.

It provides a self-contained description of a simplified economic model to test understanding of net energy analysis, a core concept in ecological economics and energy systems science. All data and definitions are present and consistent.\n\nThe first principle to be applied is the conservation of energy, as stated by the First Law of Thermodynamics. The gross energy output of an energy plant, $E_{\\text{out}}$, represents the total energy converted. This output is partitioned into two streams: the energy required for the plant's own operation, $E_{\\text{in}}$, and the net energy delivered to the non-energy sector, which we denote as $E_{\\text{net}}$. According to the principle of energy conservation, the total output must equal the sum of its parts:\n$$E_{\\text{out}} = E_{\\text{in}} + E_{\\text{net}}$$\nThe problem asks for an expression for the energy made available to the non-energy sector. This is explicitly defined as the surplus after the energy sector's own needs are met, which corresponds to $E_{\\text{net}}$. Rearranging the conservation equation, we derive the expression for net energy from first principles:\n$$E_{\\text{net}} = E_{\\text{out}} - E_{\\text{in}}$$\nThis equation represents the fundamental quantity of energy that can be used to perform work in the rest of the economy.\n\nThe problem states that the non-energy sector requires energy with a fixed intensity $\\varepsilon$, which is the ratio of energy input to non-energy output. Let the output of the non-energy sector be denoted by $Y$. Then the relationship is:\n$$\\varepsilon = \\frac{E_{\\text{net}}}{Y}$$\nTo support the expansion of the non-energy sector means to maximize its output, $Y$. From the definition of energy intensity, we can express $Y$ as:\n$$Y = \\frac{E_{\\text{net}}}{\\varepsilon}$$\nSince $\\varepsilon$ is a fixed positive constant, maximizing the non-energy sector output $Y$ is directly and monotonically equivalent to maximizing the net energy supply, $E_{\\text{net}}$. Therefore, the technology that better supports the expansion of the non-energy sector is the one that provides the greater absolute value of $E_{\\text{net}}$.\n\nThe problem specifies a constraint that \"exactly one plant can be deployed\". We must therefore evaluate $E_{\\text{net}}$ for each standardized plant technology and compare the results.\n\nFor Technology $1$, the given values are $E_{\\text{out},1} = 100$ and $E_{\\text{in},1} = 10$. The net energy supplied is:\n$$E_{\\text{net},1} = E_{\\text{out},1} - E_{\\text{in},1} = 100 - 10 = 90$$\n\nFor Technology $2$, the given values are $E_{\\text{out},2} = 50$ and $E_{\\text{in},2} = 5$. The net energy supplied is:\n$$E_{\\text{net},2} = E_{\\text{out},2} - E_{\\text{in},2} = 50 - 5 = 45$$\n\nComparing the two net energy yields:\n$$E_{\\text{net},1} = 90 > E_{\\text{net},2} = 45$$\nTechnology $1$ delivers twice the net energy to the non-energy sector compared to Technology $2$. Consequently, under the fixed capital constraint of deploying a single plant, Technology $1$ enables a larger non-energy sector.\n\nIt is worth noting that the ratio of gross output to internal input, often termed Energy Return on Investment (EROI), is identical for both technologies:\n$$\\text{EROI}_1 = \\frac{E_{\\text{out},1}}{E_{\\text{in},1}} = \\frac{100}{10} = 10$$\n$$\\text{EROI}_2 = \\frac{E_{\\text{out},2}}{E_{\\text{in},2}} = \\frac{50}{5} = 10$$\nA superficial focus on this efficiency ratio would misleadingly suggest the technologies are equivalent. However, the critical factor for the size of the supported economy is the absolute net energy surplus, not the dimensionless ratio. The problem's constraint on the number of plants highlights the importance of scale. Technology $1$ is a larger-scale plant and, for the same EROI, delivers a substantially greater quantity of useful energy.\n\nTherefore, Technology $1$ is superior for the stated objective.

Thus, the total mass of materials required per year is the product of the replacement investment's monetary value and its material intensity:\n$$\nF = m \\times I_{rep}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I_{rep}$ from the steady-state condition, we arrive at the symbolic expression for the material throughput:\n$$\nF = m \\delta K^{\\ast}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $F$ using the given parameters:\n$K^{\\ast} = 5.0 \\times 10^{12}$ monetary units (MU)\n$\\delta = 0.04 \\,\\text{yr}^{-1}$\n$m = 1.0 \\,\\text{kg/MU}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$\nF = (1.0 \\,\\text{kg/MU}) \\times (0.04 \\,\\text{yr}^{-1}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{12} \\,\\text{MU})\n$$\n$$\nF = 0.20 \\times 10^{12} \\,\\text{kg/yr} = 2.0 \\times 10^{11} \\,\\text{kg/yr}\n$$\nThe problem requests this value to be expressed in gigatonnes per year (Gt/yr), using the conversion $1\\,\\text{Gt} = 10^{12}\\,\\text{kg}$, or equivalently $1\\,\\text{kg} = 10^{-12}\\,\\text{Gt}$.\n$$\nF = (2.0 \\times 10^{11} \\,\\text{kg/yr}) \\times (10^{-12} \\,\\text{Gt/kg}) = 0.20 \\,\\text{Gt/yr}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the Decoupling Factor $D$**\n\nThe environmental impact, $E$, is proportional to the material throughput, $F$, with a proportionality constant $\\alpha$, the impact intensity: $E = \\alpha F$.

Let the new target impact be $E'$. The reduction is $0.40 E_{0}$, so the new impact is:\n$$\nE' = E_{0} - 0.40 E_{0} = (1 - 0.40)E_{0} = 0.60 E_{0}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the parameters $K^{\\ast}$, $\\delta$, and $m$ are held fixed. Consequently, the steady-state material throughput $F = m \\delta K^{\\ast}$ remains unchanged. The reduction in environmental impact must therefore be achieved entirely through a change in the impact intensity, from $\\alpha_{0}$ to a new value $\\alpha'$. The new impact $E'$ is given by:\n$$\nE' = \\alpha' F\n$$\nWe can now establish a relationship between the old and new impact intensities:\n$$\n\\alpha' F = 0.60 (\\alpha_{0} F)\n$$\nSince the material throughput $F$ is a positive, non-zero quantity, we can divide both sides of the equation by $F$:\n$$\n\\alpha' = 0.60 \\alpha_{0}\n$$\nThe decoupling factor, $D$, is defined as the ratio of the new impact intensity to the old one:\n$$\nD \\equiv \\frac{\\alpha'}{\\alpha_{0}}\n$$\nSubstituting our result for $\\alpha'$:\n$$\nD = \\frac{0.60 \\alpha_{0}}{\\alpha_{0}} = 0.60\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

Over a planning period of length $\\Delta t$, built capital rises by $30\\%$ while wetland area declines by $20\\%$.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded question that tests the understanding of fundamental principles in ecological economics. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\nThe task is to determine if weak sustainability metrics could indicate sustainability while strong sustainability criteria would not, based on the provided data. This requires applying the definitions of both frameworks.\n\n**1. Weak Sustainability Analysis**\n\nWeak sustainability posits that natural capital and built capital are substitutable. The core criterion is that the total value of all capital stocks, known as inclusive wealth ($W$), must not decline. This is equivalent to ensuring that net investment, or genuine savings ($I_{net}$), is non-negative.\nInclusive wealth is defined as the sum of all capital stocks valued at their social shadow prices. For this two-capital system:\n$$W = p_K K + p_N N$$\nSince built capital $K$ is measured in consumption-equivalent dollars, its shadow price is $p_K = 1$.\nNet investment is the change in inclusive wealth over the period $\\Delta t$:\n$$I_{net} = \\Delta W = \\Delta K + p_N \\Delta N$$\nWe must now calculate the values for $\\Delta K$ and $\\Delta N$.\n\nThe change in built capital is:\n$$\\Delta K = 0.30 \\times K_0 = 0.30 \\times (\\$200 \\times 10^9) = \\$60 \\times 10^9$$\n\nThe change in the wetland stock is:\n$$\\Delta N = -0.20 \\times N_0 = -0.20 \\times (50,000 \\text{ ha}) = -10,000 \\text{ ha}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the net investment using the provided shadow price for wetlands, $p_N = \\$2 \\times 10^6 \\text{ ha}^{-1}$:\n$$I_{net} = (\\$60 \\times 10^9) + (\\$2 \\times 10^6 \\text{ ha}^{-1}) \\times (-10,000 \\text{ ha})$$\n$$I_{net} = \\$60 \\times 10^9 - \\$20 \\times 10^9 = \\$40 \\times 10^9$$\n\nSince $I_{net} = +\\$40$ billion, which is greater than $0$, the weak sustainability criterion is satisfied. The framework indicates that the accumulation of built capital has more than compensated for the value of the lost wetland services, as measured by the given shadow price.\n\n**2. Strong Sustainability Analysis**\n\nStrong sustainability rejects the premise of perfect substitutability, especially for \"critical\" natural capital which provides life-support functions. It imposes biophysical constraints on economic activity. The central criterion for this problem is the adherence to the Safe Minimum Standard (SMS) for critical natural capital.\n\nThe problem states that wetlands are critical natural capital with a safe minimum standard of $\\bar{N} = 45,000$ hectares. The final stock of wetlands, $N_1$, after the planning period is:\n$$N_1 = N_0 + \\Delta N = 50,000 \\text{ ha} - 10,000 \\text{ ha} = 40,000 \\text{ ha}$$\n\nWe must compare the final stock $N_1$ to the SMS $\\bar{N}$:\n$$N_1 = 40,000 \\text{ ha} < 45,000 \\text{ ha} = \\bar{N}$$\n\nThe wetland stock has fallen below the defined safe minimum standard. The non-substitutability near this threshold ($\\sigma \\approx 0$) and the risk of irreversible regime shift are precisely the justifications for the SMS. Therefore, the strong sustainability criterion is violated.\n\n**Conclusion of Analysis**\nThe calculation demonstrates that for the given scenario, the weak sustainability framework indicates a sustainable outcome ($I_{net} > 0$), while the strong sustainability framework indicates an unsustainable outcome ($N_1 < \\bar{N}$). The question of whether this divergence is possible is answered in the affirmative. Now, let us evaluate the provided options.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Yes. Aggregating with the stated social shadow prices yields a positive change in inclusive wealth, satisfying weak sustainability, but the wetland stock drops below the safe minimum standard, and because near-threshold services are non-substitutable, strong sustainability flags the outcome as unsustainable.**\n- The first part, \"positive change in inclusive wealth, satisfying weak sustainability,\" is consistent with our calculation of $I_{net} = +\\$40$ billion.\n- The second part, \"the wetland stock drops below the safe minimum standard,\" is consistent with our calculation showing $N_1 = 40,000 \\text{ ha} < \\bar{N} = 45,000 \\text{ ha}$.\n- The final part correctly identifies that this violation of the SMS, particularly for a critical and non-substitutable resource, leads to a verdict of unsustainability under the strong sustainability framework.\n- The statement accurately and completely describes the situation derived from first principles. Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. No. Both frameworks deem the outcome unsustainable because any decline in a natural capital stock necessarily implies a decline in inclusive wealth when shadow prices are correctly measured, so a Hartwick-consistent metric cannot be positive in this case.**\n- The premise that \"any decline in a natural capital stock necessarily implies a decline in inclusive wealth\" is a core tenet of very strong sustainability, but it is fundamentally at odds with the definition of weak sustainability. Weak sustainability explicitly allows for substitution and compensation. Our calculation shows that the Hartwick-consistent metric (net investment) is positive, directly contradicting this option's claim. Therefore, the statement is based on a false premise about the weak sustainability framework. Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Yes, but only if wetlands are not critical; given the stated criticality and threshold, both weak and strong sustainability would register unsustainability because non-substitutability eliminates any scope for trade-offs.**\n- This option incorrectly conflates the mechanisms of the two frameworks. Weak sustainability, as defined by standard genuine savings calculations with a given finite shadow price, *does not* automatically register unsustainability just because a resource is deemed \"critical\" or \"non-substitutable\" in a different framework. The entire point of the weak sustainability calculation is to perform the trade-off based on value, which our calculation shows is positive. It is the strong sustainability framework that imposes the physical constraint related to criticality. The statement that both frameworks would register unsustainability is false. Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. No. Both frameworks deem the outcome sustainable because a $30\\%$ increase in built capital necessarily outweighs a $20\\%$ decline in wetland area in any correct welfare-consistent accounting, regardless of thresholds or substitutability.**\n- This option incorrectly concludes that both frameworks find the outcome sustainable. As demonstrated, the strong sustainability framework clearly finds the outcome unsustainable due to the violation of the SMS.\n- The claim that the outcome holds \"regardless of thresholds or substitutability\" is the opposite of the truth. Strong sustainability is precisely about the importance of such thresholds and limits to substitution. The statement is fundamentally flawed. Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on this rigorous analysis, only option A correctly describes the divergent conclusions reached by the weak and strong sustainability frameworks for the scenario presented.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2525862"}]}
