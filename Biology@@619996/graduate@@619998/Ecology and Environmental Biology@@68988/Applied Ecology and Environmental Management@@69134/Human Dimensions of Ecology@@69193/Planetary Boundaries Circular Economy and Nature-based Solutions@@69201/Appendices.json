It is a well-defined mathematical exercise grounded in established scientific and analytical principles. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the time horizon $T$ over which emissions must linearly decline to zero to exactly exhaust a given carbon budget.\n\nLet $E(t)$ be the emissions rate in Gt $\\mathrm{CO_2}$/year at time $t$ in years, where $t=0$ corresponds to the present.\nThe given initial condition is $E(0) = E_0 = 36$ Gt $\\mathrm{CO_2}$/year.\nThe emissions rate is stated to decline linearly to zero over a period of $T$ years. This is modeled by a linear function for the interval $0 \\le t \\le T$. A general linear function is of the form $f(t) = mt + c$.\n\nThe y-intercept, $c$, corresponds to the initial emissions rate, so $c = E(0) = E_0$.\nThe function becomes $E(t) = mt + E_0$.\nThe condition that emissions cease at time $T$ is $E(T) = 0$. Substituting this into the function:\n$$E(T) = mT + E_0 = 0$$\nSolving for the slope $m$:\n$$m = -\\frac{E_0}{T}$$\nThus, the analytical expression for the emissions rate for $0 \\le t \\le T$ is:\n$$E(t) = E_0 - \\frac{E_0}{T}t = E_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{t}{T}\\right)$$\nFor $t > T$, the emissions rate is zero, $E(t)=0$.\n\nThe total cumulative emissions over the period from $t=0$ to $t=T$ must equal the remaining carbon budget, $B$.

We rearrange the above equation to solve for $T$:\n$$T = \\frac{2B}{E_0}$$\nThis is the required analytical expression.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $T$. The given values are:\n- Budget, $B = 300$ Gt $\\mathrm{CO_2}$\n- Initial emissions, $E_0 = 36$ Gt $\\mathrm{CO_2}$/year\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $T$:\n$$T = \\frac{2 \\times 300}{36} = \\frac{600}{36}$$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$T = \\frac{100}{6} = \\frac{50}{3}$$\nThe exact value is $T = 16.666...$ years.
