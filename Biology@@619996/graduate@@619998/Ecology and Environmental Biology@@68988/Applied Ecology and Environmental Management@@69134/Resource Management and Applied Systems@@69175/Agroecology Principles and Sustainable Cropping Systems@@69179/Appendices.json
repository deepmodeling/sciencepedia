We may therefore proceed with a rigorous solution.\n\nThe problem asks for four specific deliverables: 1) a first-principles derivation of the Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) expression, 2) conversion of provided yields, 3) computation of the LER value, and 4) a brief interpretation.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) Expression**\n\nThe fundamental definition of LER is provided: the ratio of the total area required under monocultures to produce the same yields as the intercrop, to the area of the intercrop. Let us formalize this.\n\nLet the set of crops be indexed by $i$. In this problem, $i \\in \\{S, C, E\\}$ representing Sorghum, Cowpea, and Sesame, respectively.\nLet $A_{total}$ be the total area of the intercropping system.\nLet $P_{i,inter}$ be the total production (mass) of crop $i$ obtained from this intercrop area $A_{total}$.\nLet $Y_{i,mono}$ be the yield (mass per unit area) of crop $i$ when grown in a monoculture. The problem assumes this scales linearly with area.\n\nThe area required to produce the mass $P_{i,inter}$ of crop $i$ using a monoculture system is given by:\n$$A_{i,mono\\_req} = \\frac{P_{i,inter}}{Y_{i,mono}}$$\nThe total area required under monocultures to produce all aformentioned component yields is the sum over all crops:\n$$A_{total\\_mono\\_req} = \\sum_i A_{i,mono\\_req} = \\sum_i \\frac{P_{i,inter}}{Y_{i,mono}}$$\nAccording to the problem's definition, LER is the ratio of this total required monoculture area to the actual intercrop area $A_{total}$:\n$$LER = \\frac{A_{total\\_mono\\_req}}{A_{total}} = \\frac{\\sum_i \\frac{P_{i,inter}}{Y_{i,mono}}}{A_{total}}$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$LER = \\sum_i \\frac{1}{Y_{i,mono}} \\left( \\frac{P_{i,inter}}{A_{total}} \\right)$$\nWe define the intercrop yield of component $i$ on a per-total-field-area basis, denoted $Y_{i,inter}$, as the total production of component $i$ from the intercrop divided by the total area of the intercrop system:\n$$Y_{i,inter} \\equiv \\frac{P_{i,inter}}{A_{total}}$$\nSubstituting this definition into the LER expression yields the required relationship:\n$$LER = \\sum_i \\frac{Y_{i,inter}}{Y_{i,mono}}$$\nThis expression states that the total LER is the sum of the partial LERs for each crop, where each partial LER is the ratio of the crop's intercrop yield (per unit total area) to its monoculture yield. This derivation is complete.\n\n**2. Conversion of Intercrop Yields**\n\nThe problem provides intercrop yields per unit area of each crop's own strip, which we denote as $Y'_{i,inter}$. To use the derived formula, we must convert these to yields per total field area, $Y_{i,inter}$. This requires calculating the area fraction, $f_i$, occupied by each crop.\n\nThe repeating strip pattern is $4$ rows of sorghum, $2$ rows of cowpea, and $1$ row of sesame. Given equal row spacing, area fractions are proportional to row counts. The total number of rows in one repeating unit is $4 + 2 + 1 = 7$.\nThe area fractions are:\n- Sorghum ($S$): $f_S = \\frac{4}{7}$\n- Cowpea ($C$): $f_C = \\frac{2}{7}$\n- Sesame ($E$): $f_E = \\frac{1}{7}$\n\nThe relationship between the yield per strip area ($Y'_{i,inter}$) and the yield per total field area ($Y_{i,inter}$) is:\n$$Y_{i,inter} = Y'_{i,inter} \\times f_i$$\nThe given per-strip yields are:\n- $Y'_{S,inter} = 6.1 \\text{ Mg ha}^{-1}$\n- $Y'_{C,inter} = 2.1 \\text{ Mg ha}^{-1}$\n- $Y'_{E,inter} = 1.3 \\text{ Mg ha}^{-1}$\n\nWe compute the yields per total field area:\n- $Y_{S,inter} = 6.1 \\times \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{24.4}{7} \\text{ Mg ha}^{-1}$\n- $Y_{C,inter} = 2.1 \\times \\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{4.2}{7} = 0.6 \\text{ Mg ha}^{-1}$\n- $Y_{E,inter} = 1.3 \\times \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{1.3}{7} \\text{ Mg ha}^{-1}$\n\n**3. Computation of the LER**\n\nWe now use the derived expression for LER and the yields. The given monoculture yields are:\n- $Y_{S,mono} = 5.8 \\text{ Mg ha}^{-1}$\n- $Y_{C,mono} = 1.7 \\text{ Mg ha}^{-1}$\n- $Y_{E,mono} = 0.95 \\text{ Mg ha}^{-1}$\n\nThe LER is the sum of the partial LERs ($LER_i = Y_{i,inter} / Y_{i,mono}$):\n$$LER = LER_S + LER_C + LER_E$$\nWe calculate each partial LER:\n- $LER_S = \\frac{Y_{S,inter}}{Y_{S,mono}} = \\frac{24.4/7}{5.8} = \\frac{24.4}{7 \\times 5.8} = \\frac{24.4}{40.6}$\n- $LER_C = \\frac{Y_{C,inter}}{Y_{C,mono}} = \\frac{0.6}{1.7}$\n- $LER_E = \\frac{Y_{E,inter}}{Y_{E,mono}} = \\frac{1.3/7}{0.95} = \\frac{1.3}{7 \\times 0.95} = \\frac{1.3}{6.65}$\n\nNow, we sum the numerical values:\n$$LER = \\frac{24.4}{40.6} + \\frac{0.6}{1.7} + \\frac{1.3}{6.65}$$\n$$LER \\approx 0.60098522 + 0.35294118 + 0.19548872$$\n$$LER \\approx 1.14941512$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, the LER is $1.149$.\n\n**4. Interpretation of the LER Value**\n\nA value of $LER > 1.0$ indicates a yield advantage of the intercropping system over growing the crops as separate monocultures. The calculated value $LER = 1.149$ signifies that to achieve the same production of sorghum, cowpea, and sesame as obtained from one hectare of this intercrop, one would require $1.149$ hectares of land if the crops were grown separately in monocultures. This corresponds to a land-saving of approximately $14.9\\%$.

The economic principle of profit maximization by equating marginal revenue and marginal cost is a fundamental concept in microeconomics.

It is a standard optimization problem in agricultural economics. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to find the nitrogen application rate $N$ that maximizes the profit function $\\pi(N)$, where $N \\geq 0$. The profit function is given by:\n$$\n\\pi(N) = P_{y}Y(N) - P_{n}N\n$$\nGiven the piecewise nature of the yield function $Y(N)$, the profit function $\\pi(N)$ is also piecewise:\n$$\n\\pi(N) = \\begin{cases} P_{y}(Y_{0} + rN - sN^{2}) - P_{n}N & \\text{for } 0 \\leq N \\leq N_{b} \\\\ P_{y}Y(N_{b}) - P_{n}N & \\text{for } N > N_{b} \\end{cases}\n$$\nFirst, we calculate the agronomic break-point $N_{b}$, which is the nitrogen rate at which the yield is maximized. This occurs where the marginal physical product, $\\frac{dY}{dN}$, is zero. For the quadratic portion of the response function, $\\frac{dY}{dN} = r - 2sN$. Setting this to zero gives $N = \\frac{r}{2s}$, which matches the provided definition for $N_{b}$. Substituting the given values:\n$$\nN_{b} = \\frac{r}{2s} = \\frac{0.024}{2(6.0 \\times 10^{-5})} = \\frac{0.024}{1.2 \\times 10^{-4}} = 200 \\; \\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{ha}^{-1}\n$$\nTo find the economically optimal nitrogen rate $N^{\\ast}$, we apply the fundamental condition for profit maximization. The profit is maximized when the marginal profit, $\\frac{d\\pi}{dN}$, is equal to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\pi}{dN} = P_{y}\\frac{dY}{dN} - P_{n} = 0\n$$\nThis condition can be rearranged to state that the Marginal Value Product ($MVP_{N} = P_{y}\\frac{dY}{dN}$) must equal the Marginal Input Cost ($MIC_{N} = P_{n}$).\n$$\nP_{y}\\frac{dY}{dN} = P_{n}\n$$\nWe must analyze this condition within the defined domains of the function.\n\nCase 1: $0 \\leq N \\leq N_{b}$\nIn this region, $\\frac{dY}{dN} = r - 2sN$. The optimality condition becomes:\n$$\nP_{y}(r - 2sN) = P_{n}\n$$\nWe solve for $N$:\n$$\nr - 2sN = \\frac{P_{n}}{P_{y}}\n$$\n$$\n2sN = r - \\frac{P_{n}}{P_{y}}\n$$\n$$\nN = \\frac{1}{2s}\\left(r - \\frac{P_{n}}{P_{y}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the candidate for the optimal nitrogen rate, $N^{\\ast}$. The second-order condition for a maximum requires $\\frac{d^{2}\\pi}{dN^{2}} < 0$. Differentiating the marginal profit, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}\\pi}{dN^{2}} = \\frac{d}{dN}\\left(P_{y}(r - 2sN) - P_{n}\\right) = -2P_{y}s\n$$\nSince $P_{y} > 0$ and $s > 0$, the second derivative is always negative. This confirms that the profit function is strictly concave for $0 \\leq N \\leq N_{b}$, and any stationary point found in this interval is a unique maximum.\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\nP_{y} = 170 \\\\\nP_{n} = 1.10 \\\\\nr = 0.024 \\\\\ns = 6.0 \\times 10^{-5}\n$$\nThe price ratio is $\\frac{P_{n}}{P_{y}} = \\frac{1.10}{170}$.\nThe candidate for the optimal rate is:\n$$\nN = \\frac{1}{2(6.0 \\times 10^{-5})}\\left(0.024 - \\frac{1.10}{170}\\right) = \\frac{1}{1.2 \\times 10^{-4}}\\left(0.024 - 0.0064705...\\right)\n$$\n$$\nN = \\frac{1}{1.2 \\times 10^{-4}}(0.0175294...) \\approx 146.0786 \\; \\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{ha}^{-1}\n$$\nSince this value of $N \\approx 146.08$ is between $0$ and $N_{b} = 200$, this is a valid solution within this domain. Thus, the economically optimal rate is $N^{\\ast} \\approx 146.08 \\; \\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{ha}^{-1}$.\n\nCase 2: $N > N_{b}$\nIn this region, the yield is constant at $Y(N_{b})$. The profit function is $\\pi(N) = P_{y}Y(N_{b}) - P_{n}N$. The marginal profit is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\pi}{dN} = -P_{n} = -1.10\n$$\nSince the marginal profit is negative, the profit function is strictly decreasing for all $N > N_{b}$. Therefore, the optimal rate cannot lie in this region. The profit is always maximized by reducing $N$ towards $N_{b}$.\n\nThe global maximum of the profit function $\\pi(N)$ for $N \\geq 0$ must therefore be the value found in the first case.\n$N^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2s}\\left(r - \\frac{P_{n}}{P_{y}}\\right)$.\n\nThe problem asks for an interpretation of the shadow price of nitrogen at $N^{\\ast}$. In the context of unconstrained input optimization, the \"shadow price\" of an input is its marginal value product, $MVP_{N} = P_{y}\\frac{dY}{dN}$. At the economic optimum $N = N^{\\ast}$, the optimality condition $P_{y}\\frac{dY}{dN} = P_{n}$ dictates that the marginal value product of nitrogen is exactly equal to its market price. This means that at the optimal rate $N^{\\ast}$, the revenue gained from applying one additional infinitesimal unit of nitrogen is precisely equal to the cost of that unit. If less nitrogen were applied ($N < N^{\\ast}$), the marginal value product would exceed the price ($MVP_{N} > P_{n}$), indicating that profit could be increased by applying more nitrogen. If more nitrogen were applied ($N > N^{\\ast}$ but still $N < N_b$), the marginal value product would be less than the price ($MVP_{N} < P_{n}$), meaning that the last unit of nitrogen applied cost more than the revenue it generated, thus reducing profit. The optimality condition is the point of economic equilibrium where no further gains are possible.\n\nFinally, rounding the calculated optimal nitrogen rate to three significant figures:\n$$\nN^{\\ast} \\approx 146.0786 \\implies N^{\\ast} = 146 \\; \\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{ha}^{-1}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{146}\n$$", "id": "2469583"}, {"introduction": "Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a cornerstone of agroecology that replaces prophylactic treatments with knowledge-based, targeted interventions.
