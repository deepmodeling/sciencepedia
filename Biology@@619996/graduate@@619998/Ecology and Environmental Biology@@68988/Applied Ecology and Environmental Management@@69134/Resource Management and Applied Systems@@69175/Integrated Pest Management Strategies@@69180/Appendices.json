We determine its expectation to assess its bias as an estimator for $m$. Using the linearity of expectation and the result from Part $1$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{X}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right] = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbb{E}[X_i]$$\nSince all $X_i$ are identically distributed, $\\mathbb{E}[X_i] = m p_d$ for all $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$.\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{X}] = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (m p_d) = \\frac{1}{n} (n m p_d) = m p_d$$\nAn estimator is unbiased if its expectation equals the parameter being estimated. Here, we are estimating $m$. For $\\bar{X}$ to be an unbiased estimator of $m$, we would need $\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{X}] = m$. However, we have $\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{X}] = m p_d$.\nThe problem specifies $p_d \\in (0,1)$, so $p_d < 1$. In this case, $m p_d \\neq m$ (assuming $m>0$, which is implicit for a population mean). Therefore, $\\bar{X}$ is a biased estimator of $m$.\n\nThe bias is defined as $\\operatorname{Bias}(\\bar{X}; m) = \\mathbb{E}[\\bar{X}] - m$.\n$$\\operatorname{Bias}(\\bar{X}; m) = m p_d - m = m(p_d - 1)$$\nSince $p_d < 1$, the term $(p_d - 1)$ is negative, and thus the bias is negative. This indicates that ignoring imperfect detection leads to a systematic underestimation of the true mean abundance.\n\nThe relative bias is the bias divided by the true parameter value:\n$$\\text{Relative Bias} = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{X}] - m}{m} = \\frac{m(p_d - 1)}{m} = p_d - 1$$\n\n**Part 3: Unbiased estimator $\\hat{m}$ and its variance**\n\nWe seek an estimator $\\hat{m}$ that is a function of $\\bar{X}$ and $p_d$ and is unbiased for $m$. That is, we require $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{m}] = m$.\nFrom Part $2$, we know that $\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{X}] = m p_d$. To construct an unbiased estimator, we can correct for the factor $p_d$. Let us define the estimator $\\hat{m}$ as:\n$$\\hat{m} = \\frac{\\bar{X}}{p_d}$$\nThe expectation of this estimator is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{m}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{\\bar{X}}{p_d}\\right] = \\frac{1}{p_d} \\mathbb{E}[\\bar{X}] = \\frac{1}{p_d} (m p_d) = m$$\nSince $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{m}] = m$, $\\hat{m}$ is an unbiased estimator of $m$.\n\nNext, we derive the variance of $\\hat{m}$. Using the property $\\operatorname{Var}(aY) = a^2 \\operatorname{Var}(Y)$ for a constant $a$ and random variable $Y$:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{m}) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\frac{\\bar{X}}{p_d}\\right) = \\frac{1}{p_d^2} \\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{X})$$\nTo find $\\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{X})$, we use the fact that the $n$ sampling units are independent, which implies that the random variables $N_i$ are independent. Since the detection process within each unit is also independent of others, the observed counts $X_i$ are independent and identically distributed (IID).\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{X}) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right) = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right)$$\nFor independent random variables, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{X}) = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\operatorname{Var}(X_i)$$\nSince the $X_i$ are identically distributed, $\\operatorname{Var}(X_i) = m p_d$ for all $i$.\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{X}) = \\frac{1}{n^2} (n \\cdot m p_d) = \\frac{m p_d}{n}$$\nFinally, we substitute this result into the expression for $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{m})$:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{m}) = \\frac{1}{p_d^2} \\left( \\frac{m p_d}{n} \\right) = \\frac{m}{n p_d}$$\nThis final expression for the variance of the unbiased estimator $\\hat{m}$ is given in terms of the model parameters $m$, $n$, and $p_d$, as required.\nThe results for Part $3$ are the estimator $\\hat{m} = \\frac{\\bar{X}}{p_d}$ and its variance $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{m}) = \\frac{m}{n p_d}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\bar{X}}{p_d} & \\frac{m}{n p_d}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2499113"}, {"introduction": "Once monitoring provides a reliable picture of pest pressure, the focus of IPM shifts from estimation to economic decision-making.
