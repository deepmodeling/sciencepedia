The stability conditions are:\n- $E_{M}$ is stable if $G  G_{\\text{up}}$.\n- $E_{C}$ is stable if $G  G_{\\text{down}}$.\nThe regime of bistability is the interval of grazing intensities $G$ satisfying $G_{\\text{down}}  G  G_{\\text{up}}$. This requires that $G_{\\text{up}}  G_{\\text{down}}$ as a necessary condition for hysteresis. The existence of an intermediate saddle equilibrium that separates the basins of attraction for $E_C$ and $E_M$ is a feature of this bistable region.\n\nFinally, we calculate the hysteresis width, $\\Delta G = G_{\\text{up}} - G_{\\text{down}}$.\n$$ \\Delta G = \\left( r_{M} \\frac{a+m}{r_{C}+a} \\right) - \\left( r_{M} - (r_{M}+b)\\frac{r_{C}-m}{r_{C}} \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta G = r_{M} \\left( \\frac{a+m}{r_{C}+a} - 1 \\right) + (r_{M}+b)\\frac{r_{C}-m}{r_{C}} $$\n$$ \\Delta G = r_{M} \\left( \\frac{a+m - (r_{C}+a)}{r_{C}+a} \\right) + (r_{M}+b)\\frac{r_{C}-m}{r_{C}} $$\n$$ \\Delta G = r_{M} \\left( \\frac{m-r_{C}}{r_{C}+a} \\right) + (r_{M}+b)\\frac{r_{C}-m}{r_{C}} $$\nWe factor out the term $(r_{C}-m)$:\n$$ \\Delta G = (r_{C}-m) \\left[ \\frac{r_{M}+b}{r_{C}} - \\frac{r_{M}}{r_{C}+a} \\right] $$\nTo simplify the expression in the brackets, we find a common denominator, $r_{C}(r_{C}+a)$:\n$$ \\frac{(r_{M}+b)(r_{C}+a) - r_{M}r_{C}}{r_{C}(r_{C}+a)} = \\frac{(r_{M}r_{C} + ar_{M} + br_{C} + ab) - r_{M}r_{C}}{r_{C}(r_{C}+a)} = \\frac{ar_{M} + br_{C} + ab}{r_{C}(r_{C}+a)} $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\Delta G$:\n$$ \\Delta G = (r_{C}-m) \\left( \\frac{ar_{M} + br_{C} + ab}{r_{C}(r_{C}+a)} \\right) $$\nThis expression is the final answer. It is positive, signifying a region of bistability, if and only if $r_{C}  m$, which is the condition for the coral-dominated state to exist in the first place. This is a consistent and logical result.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{(r_{C}-m)(ar_{M} + br_{C} + ab)}{r_{C}(r_{C}+a)}}\n$$", "id": "2479275"}]}
