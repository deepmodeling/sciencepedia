We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe derivation begins with the principle of conservation of mass under steady-state conditions. For a control volume of infinitesimal width $dx$ and unit thickness in the out-of-plane direction, the net lateral flux must balance the incoming recharge.\n\nThe lateral discharge per unit width, $q(x)$, is given by Darcy's law for an unconfined aquifer. Under the Dupuit–Forchheimer assumptions, the hydraulic gradient is $\\frac{dh}{dx}$, and the cross-sectional area of flow is $h(x) \\times 1$. Thus,\n$$q(x) = -K h(x) \\frac{dh}{dx}$$\nThis can be rewritten using the identity $h \\frac{dh}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d(h^2)}{dx}$:\n$$q(x) = -\\frac{K}{2} \\frac{d(h^2)}{dx}$$\nThe steady-state water balance for an elemental strip from $x$ to $x+dx$ is expressed as the change in discharge across the element being equal to the recharge entering the element from above.\n$$q(x) - q(x+dx) = -w \\, dx$$\nThis can be written in differential form as:\n$$\\frac{dq}{dx} = w$$\nSubstituting the expression for $q(x)$ into the water balance equation gives the governing differential equation for the water table profile:\n$$\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( -\\frac{K}{2} \\frac{d(h^2)}{dx} \\right) = w$$\nSince $K$ is assumed to be homogeneous (constant), this simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{d^2(h^2)}{dx^2} = -\\frac{2w}{K}$$\nThis is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation in the variable $h^2(x)$. We solve this equation by integrating twice with respect to $x$.\n\nFirst integration yields:\n$$\\frac{d(h^2)}{dx} = -\\frac{2w}{K}x + C_1$$\nwhere $C_1$ is the first constant of integration. We apply the first boundary condition at the groundwater divide ($x=0$), which is a no-flow boundary due to symmetry. The flux $q(0)$ is zero, which means $\\left.\\frac{d(h^2)}{dx}\\right|_{x=0}=0$.\nSubstituting this into the integrated equation:\n$$0 = -\\frac{2w}{K}(0) + C_1 \\implies C_1 = 0$$\nThe equation thus becomes:\n$$\\frac{d(h^2)}{dx} = -\\frac{2w}{K}x$$\nSecond integration yields:\n$$h^2(x) = \\int -\\frac{2w}{K}x \\, dx = -\\frac{w}{K}x^2 + C_2$$\nwhere $C_2$ is the second constant of integration. We apply the second boundary condition at the stream ($x=L$), which is a fixed head boundary: $h(L) = H_s$. Therefore, $h^2(L) = H_s^2$.\nSubstituting this into the solution:\n$$H_s^2 = -\\frac{w}{K}L^2 + C_2$$\nSolving for $C_2$:\n$$C_2 = H_s^2 + \\frac{w}{K}L^2$$\nNow, substitute the expression for $C_2$ back into the equation for $h^2(x)$:\n$$h^2(x) = -\\frac{w}{K}x^2 + H_s^2 + \\frac{w}{K}L^2$$\nRearranging gives the final closed-form expression for the square of the water table elevation:\n$$h^2(x) = H_s^2 + \\frac{w}{K}(L^2 - x^2)$$\nTaking the square root gives the water table profile $h(x)$:\n$$h(x) = \\sqrt{H_s^2 + \\frac{w}{K}(L^2 - x^2)}$$\nThis is the required expression for the water table profile on $0 \\le x \\le L$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the water table elevation at mid-slope, $x=L/2$.

The physical model described—one-dimensional advection and dispersion with linear equilibrium sorption—is a canonical problem in contaminant hydrogeology. I will therefore proceed with the solution.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Governing Equation and Breakthrough Curve**\n\nThe derivation starts from the principle of conservation of mass for the solute within a one-dimensional control volume of infinitesimal length $dx$ and unit cross-sectional area $A=1$. The total mass of solute per unit bulk volume is the sum of the mass in the aqueous phase and the sorbed phase. Let $c(x,t)$ be the aqueous concentration [mass of solute / volume of water] and $s(x,t)$ be the sorbed concentration [mass of solute / mass of solid matrix]. The total mass of solute per unit bulk volume of the porous medium is $C_T = \\theta c + \\rho_b s$, where $\\theta$ is the volumetric water content (porosity) and $\\rho_b$ is the bulk density of the solid matrix.\n\nThe conservation of mass for a non-reactive solute in one dimension states that the rate of change of total solute mass in the control volume must equal the net rate of solute flux into the volume:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (\\theta c + \\rho_b s) = -\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x}\n$$\nwhere $J$ is the total solute flux per unit bulk cross-sectional area [mass / (area $\\cdot$ time)]. The flux $J$ is due to advection with the mean pore-water velocity $v$ and hydrodynamic dispersion, which is modeled by Fick's first law. The flux is carried only within the water-filled portion of the cross-section, so it is scaled by the porosity $\\theta$:\n$$\nJ = \\theta v c - \\theta D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\n$$\nHere, $D$ is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient. Substituting the expression for $J$ into the mass balance equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (\\theta c + \\rho_b s) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(\\theta v c - \\theta D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right)\n$$\nAssuming the parameters $\\theta$, $\\rho_b$, $v$, and $D$ are constant in space and time, the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\theta \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\rho_b \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial t} = -\\theta v \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} + \\theta D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThe problem specifies instantaneous, reversible, linear equilibrium sorption, described by the linear isotherm $s = K_d c$, where $K_d$ is the distribution coefficient. Differentiating this with respect to time gives $\\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial t} = K_d \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t}$. Substituting this into the mass balance equation gives:\n$$\n\\theta \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\rho_b K_d \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = (\\theta + \\rho_b K_d) \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\theta v \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} + \\theta D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nWe define the dimensionless retardation factor, $R$, as:\n$$\nR = 1 + \\frac{\\rho_b K_d}{\\theta}\n$$\nThe mass balance equation can then be written as:\n$$\n\\theta R \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\theta v \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} + \\theta D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nDividing by $\\theta R$ gives the final governing transport equation for the aqueous concentration $c(x,t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{v}{R} \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} + \\frac{D}{R} \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThis equation is identical in form to the standard advection-dispersion equation (ADE) for a conservative solute (where $R=1$), but with an effective (retarded) advection velocity $v' = v/R$ and an effective dispersion coefficient $D' = D/R$.\n\nThe problem describes an impulsive input of a solute mass $M$ per unit cross-sectional area at $x=0$ and $t=0$. For an infinite or semi-infinite domain, this corresponds to an initial condition that is a Dirac delta function. The total mass per unit area, $M$, must be conserved over time: $M = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (\\theta c(x,t) + \\rho_b s(x,t)) dx = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\theta R c(x,t) dx$.\nThe standard analytical solution to the ADE with retarded parameters for an instantaneous plane source in an infinite domain is a Gaussian distribution:\n$$\nc(x,t) = \\frac{M}{\\theta R \\sqrt{4\\pi (D/R) t}} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{(x - (v/R)t)^2}{4(D/R)t} \\right)\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\nc(x,t) = \\frac{M}{\\theta \\sqrt{4\\pi DRt}} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{(Rx - vt)^2}{4DRt} \\right)\n$$\nThe breakthrough curve (BTC) at the stream margin $x=L$ is the concentration as a function of time at that location, $c(L,t)$:\n$$\nc(L,t) = \\frac{M}{\\theta \\sqrt{4\\pi DRt}} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{(RL - vt)^2}{4DRt} \\right)\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Travel-Time Delay Calculation**\n\nThe mean travel time, $\\bar{t}$, of a solute to a location $x=L$ corresponds to the first temporal moment of the BTC.
