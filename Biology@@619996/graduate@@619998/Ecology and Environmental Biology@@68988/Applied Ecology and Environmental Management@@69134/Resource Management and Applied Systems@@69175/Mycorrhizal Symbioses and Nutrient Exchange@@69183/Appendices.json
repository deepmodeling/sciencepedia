The physical parameters are realistic for microbial systems. No flaws related to scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, or ambiguity are found.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis begins with the derivation of the area-specific uptake rate from the provided reaction scheme. The transporter protein is denoted by $E$, the substrate (phosphate) by $S$, and the transporter-substrate complex by $ES$. The elementary reaction steps with their associated rate constants are:\n$$ E + S \\xrightarrow{k_1} ES $$\n$$ ES \\xrightarrow{k_{-1}} E + S $$\n$$ ES \\xrightarrow{k_2} E + P $$\nwhere $P$ represents the transported phosphate. The net rate of formation of the $ES$ complex is given by the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_1 [E][S] - k_{-1}[ES] - k_2[ES] = k_1 [E][S] - (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\nThe problem states the quasi-steady-state assumption for the complex $ES$, which implies that its concentration changes much more slowly than the concentrations of the substrate and product. We set its rate of change to zero:\n$$ \\frac{d[ES]}{dt} \\approx 0 $$\nThis yields:\n$$ k_1 [E][S] \\approx (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\nThe total concentration of transporter, $[E]_T$, is conserved:\n$$ [E]_T = [E] + [ES] \\implies [E] = [E]_T - [ES] $$\nSubstituting the expression for $[E]$ into the steady-state equation gives:\n$$ k_1 ([E]_T - [ES])[S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\nSolving for $[ES]$:\n$$ k_1 [E]_T [S] - k_1 [ES][S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\n$$ k_1 [E]_T [S] = [ES] (k_1 [S] + k_{-1} + k_2) $$\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{k_1 [E]_T [S]}{k_1 [S] + k_{-1} + k_2} = \\frac{[E]_T [S]}{\\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1} + [S]} $$\nThe Michaelis constant, $K_m$, is defined as $K_m = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1}$. Substituting this definition:\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{[E]_T [S]}{K_m + [S]} $$\nThe uptake rate, or velocity $V$, is the rate of product formation, which is proportional to the concentration of the complex: $V = k_2 [ES]$.\n$$ V = \\frac{k_2 [E]_T [S]}{K_m + [S]} $$\nThe maximum velocity, $V_{\\max}$, is achieved when the transporter is saturated with substrate ($[S] \\to \\infty$), meaning $[ES] \\to [E]_T$. Thus, $V_{\\max} = k_2 [E]_T$.\nThis yields the familiar Michaelis-Menten equation. In this problem, the velocity $V$ is an area-specific uptake rate, which we denote $J_A$. The substrate concentration $[S]$ is the external concentration at the hyphal surface, which is given as $C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}$ due to the assumption of negligible diffusion limitation. The maximum uptake capacity is given as $V_{\\max}$. The equation for the area-specific uptake rate is therefore:\n$$ J_A = \\frac{V_{\\max} C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}}{K_m + C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}} $$\nThis completes the requested derivation of the kinetic form.\n\nNext, we express the uptake rate per unit hyphal length, denoted $J_L$. This is the product of the area-specific uptake rate $J_A$ and the surface area per unit length, $A_L$. For a cylinder of radius $r$, the surface area is $2\\pi r L$ for a length $L$. The area per unit length is $A_L = 2\\pi r$.\n$$ J_L = J_A \\cdot A_L = \\left( \\frac{V_{\\max} C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}}{K_m + C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}} \\right) (2\\pi r) $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided parameters:\n-   $r = 2.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $V_{\\max} = 1.6 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n-   $K_{m} = 2.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n-   $C_{\\mathrm{bulk}} = 0.4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nThe units for $K_m$ and $C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}$ are the same, so the ratio $\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}}{K_m + C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}}$ is dimensionless:\n$$ \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}}{K_m + C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}} = \\frac{0.4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{2.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} + 0.4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{0.4}{2.4} = \\frac{1}{6} $$\nSubstituting the values into the expression for $J_L$:\n$$ J_L = (2\\pi) (2.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\left( \\frac{(1.6 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) (0.4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})}{2.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} + 0.4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} \\right) $$\n$$ J_L = (5\\pi \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\left( (1.6 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) \\right) $$\n$$ J_L = \\frac{5 \\pi \\times 1.6}{6} \\times 10^{-6} \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ J_L = \\frac{8 \\pi}{6} \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in femtomoles per second per meter ($ \\mathrm{fmol}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1} $).

In the limit where the external concentration is much lower than the half-saturation concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{bulk}} \\ll K_m$, the denominator of the uptake rate equation simplifies: $K_m + C_{\\mathrm{bulk}} \\approx K_m$. The area-specific uptake rate becomes approximately linear with respect to the substrate concentration:\n$$ J_A \\approx \\frac{V_{\\max} C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}}{K_m} = \\left(\\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_m}\\right) C_{\\mathrm{bulk}} $$\nThe term $\\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_m}$ represents the initial slope of the uptake curve and is called the specific affinity or catalytic efficiency of the transporter for the substrate at low concentrations. It quantifies the transporter's ability to scavenge substrate from a dilute solution. To maximize uptake in a nutrient-poor environment, an organism must possess transporters with a high value of $\\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_m}$. Since $K_m$ is in the denominator of this efficiency term, a smaller $K_m$ value signifies a higher affinity of the transporter for its substrate. This allows for efficient substrate capture even at very low ambient concentrations, which is a critical adaptation for organisms like fungi living in oligotrophic soil environments.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4.19}\n$$", "id": "2511492"}, {"introduction": "Acquiring a nutrient is only the first step; the organism must then invest further energy to assimilate it into a biochemically useful form.

As one mole of $\\text{NO}_3^-$ contains one mole of nitrogen, the transport cost is:\n    $C_{\\text{transport}, \\text{NO}_3^-} = 1$ $\\text{ATP}$ per mole N.\n\n-   **Assimilation Cost ($C_{\\text{assimilation}, \\text{NO}_3^-}$)**:\n    Assimilation of nitrate occurs in two stages: reduction to ammonium, followed by incorporation into glutamate.\n    a) **Reduction**: The problem states that the reduction of $1$ mole of $\\text{NO}_3^-$ to $\\text{NH}_4^+$ consumes $4$ moles of $\\text{NADPH}$.\n    b) **Incorporation**: The resulting $\\text{NH}_4^+$ is assimilated via the GS-GOGAT pathway, which consumes $1$ mole of $\\text{ATP}$ and $1$ mole of $\\text{NADPH}$ per mole of N.\n    The total assimilation cost is the sum of these two stages:\n    $C_{\\text{assimilation}, \\text{NO}_3^-} = (4 \\text{ NADPH}) + (1 \\text{ ATP} + 1 \\text{ NADPH}) = 1 \\text{ ATP} + 5 \\text{ NADPH}$ per mole N.\n\n-   **Total Cost for Nitrate ($C_{\\text{total}, \\text{NO}_3^-}$)**:\n    The total cost is the sum of transport and assimilation costs.\n    $C_{\\text{total}, \\text{NO}_3^-} = (1 \\text{ ATP}) + (1 \\text{ ATP} + 5 \\text{ NADPH}) = 2 \\text{ ATP} + 5 \\text{ NADPH}$.\n    To express this entirely in $\\text{ATP}$ equivalents, we use the conversion factor $\\phi = \\frac{5}{2}$ $\\text{ATP}$ per $\\text{NADPH}$.\n    $C_{\\text{total}, \\text{NO}_3^-} = 2 + 5 \\cdot \\phi = 2 + 5 \\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right) = 2 + \\frac{25}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} + \\frac{25}{2} = \\frac{29}{2}$ $\\text{ATP}$ equivalents per mole N.\n\n**2. Cost for Ammonium ($\\text{NH}_4^+$)**\n\n-   **Transport Cost ($C_{\\text{transport}, \\text{NH}_4^+}$)**:\n    Ammonium is acquired via diffusion of neutral $\\text{NH}_3$, which has a negligible direct cost. Therefore:\n    $C_{\\text{transport}, \\text{NH}_4^+} = 0$ $\\text{ATP}$ per mole N.\n\n-   **Assimilation Cost ($C_{\\text{assimilation}, \\text{NH}_4^+}$)**:\n    Ammonium is directly assimilated via the GS-GOGAT pathway. This costs $1$ mole of $\\text{ATP}$ and $1$ mole of $\\text{NADPH}$ per mole of N.\n    $C_{\\text{assimilation}, \\text{NH}_4^+} = 1 \\text{ ATP} + 1 \\text{ NADPH}$ per mole N.\n\n-   **Total Cost for Ammonium ($C_{\\text{total}, \\text{NH}_4^+}$)**:\n    The total cost is the sum of transport and assimilation costs.\n    $C_{\\text{total}, \\text{NH}_4^+} = (0 \\text{ ATP}) + (1 \\text{ ATP} + 1 \\text{ NADPH}) = 1 \\text{ ATP} + 1 \\text{ NADPH}$.\n    Converting to $\\text{ATP}$ equivalents:\n    $C_{\\text{total}, \\text{NH}_4^+} = 1 + 1 \\cdot \\phi = 1 + 1 \\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2}{2} + \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{7}{2}$ $\\text{ATP}$ equivalents per mole N.\n\n**3. Cost for a Neutral Amino Acid**\n\n-   **Transport Cost ($C_{\\text{transport}, \\text{AA}}$)**:\n    The neutral amino acid is taken up via $1:1$ $\\text{H}^+$ symport. As with nitrate, this requires $1$ mole of $\\text{ATP}$ to pump out the co-transported $\\text{H}^+$. Since the amino acid contains one nitrogen atom, the cost per mole of nitrogen is:\n    $C_{\\text{transport}, \\text{AA}} = 1$ $\\text{ATP}$ per mole N.\n\n-   **Assimilation Cost ($C_{\\text{assimilation}, \\text{AA}}$)**:\n    The problem states that nitrogen is transferred via an aminotransferase reaction with no direct cost in $\\text{ATP}$ or $\\text{NADPH}$.\n    $C_{\\text{assimilation}, \\text{AA}} = 0$ per mole N.\n\n-   **Total Cost for Amino Acid ($C_{\\text{total}, \\text{AA}}$)**:\n    The total cost is the sum of transport and assimilation costs.\n    $C_{\\text{total}, \\text{AA}} = (1 \\text{ ATP}) + 0 = 1$ $\\text{ATP}$ equivalent per mole N.\n\nThe calculated costs in $\\text{ATP}$ equivalents per mole of nitrogen are:\n-   Nitrate: $\\frac{29}{2}$\n-   Ammonium: $\\frac{7}{2}$\n-   Amino acid: $1$\n\nThe final answer is required as an ordered triple in a row matrix: $(\\text{nitrate} \\quad \\text{ammonium} \\quad \\text{amino acid})$.\nThis corresponds to the values $\\left(\\frac{29}{2} \\quad \\frac{7}{2} \\quad 1\\right)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{29}{2} & \\frac{7}{2} & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2511499"}]}
