We must begin from first principles, as instructed. The per capita growth rate of the predator population, denoted as $\\frac{1}{P}\\frac{dP}{dt}$, is the difference between its per capita birth rate and its per capita death rate. The per capita death rate is given as a constant, $m$. The per capita birth rate is the product of the per capita consumption rate of pests, $f(N)$, and the conversion efficiency, $e$. Therefore, the per capita growth rate of the predator is given by the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{P}\\frac{dP}{dt} = e \\cdot f(N) - m\n$$\nThe problem specifies the Holling Type III functional response for the predator's per capita consumption rate:\n$$\nf(N) = \\frac{a N^{2}}{1 + a h N^{2}}\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the pest density, $a$ is the attack coefficient, and $h$ is the handling time.

Each adult produces $F$ seeds. This corresponds to the matrix element $M_{13} = F$. Juveniles do not produce seeds, so $M_{12} = 0$.\n\n-   $J_{t+1}$ (Juveniles at next census) is the sum of two contributions:\n    1.  Seeds from $S_t$ that germinate ($g$) and successfully establish as juveniles ($s_g$). This corresponds to $M_{21} = g s_g$.\n    2.  Juveniles from $J_t$ that survive and remain juveniles ($p_j$). This corresponds to $M_{22} = p_j$. Adults do not revert to the juvenile stage, so $M_{23} = 0$.\n\n-   $A_{t+1}$ (Adults at next census) is the sum of two contributions:\n    1.  Juveniles from $J_t$ that mature into adults ($s_{ja}$). This corresponds to $M_{32} = s_{ja}$.\n    2.  Adults from $A_t$ that survive and remain adults ($s_a$). This corresponds to $M_{33} = s_a$.

Fecundity $F$ is reduced by a factor of $(1-c)$. The new effective fecundity is $F' = F(1-c)$. This affects element $M_{13}$.\n2.  Seed bank survival $s_s$ is reduced by an additional mortality $h$, so the new survival rate is $s_s' = s_s(1-h)$. This affects element $M_{11}$.\n\nAll other vital rates ($g, s_g, p_j, s_{ja}, s_a$) are unchanged.

The value of $f(0.8994)$ is closer to zero, indicating the root is closer to $0.8994$. Using linear interpolation:\n$$ \\lambda \\approx 0.8993 + (0.8994 - 0.8993) \\frac{f(0.8993)}{f(0.8993) - f(0.8994)} \\approx 0.8993 + 0.0001 \\frac{0.000031}{0.000031 - (-0.000005)} \\approx 0.899386 $$\nRounding this value to four significant figures gives $0.8994$.\nThe post-introduction asymptotic growth rate is $\\lambda \\approx 0.8994$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8994}$$", "id": "2473118"}, {"introduction": "While the previous practices explored an agent's potential to persist and suppress pests, successful biological control first requires the agent to establish a viable population from a limited release.

The number of males is $N_m = pN$, and the number of females is $N_f = (1-p)N$. The problem states that encounters between a searching female and males follow a Poisson process and that the instantaneous encounter rate per female scales with male abundance by mass action.

The fraction of females that become mated, $F(N)$, is therefore the probability of having one or more encounters. This is the complement of having zero encounters.\n$$ F(N) = P(k \\geq 1) = 1 - P(k=0) $$\nThe probability of zero encounters is:\n$$ P(k=0) = \\frac{(\\beta p N \\tau)^0 \\exp(-\\beta p N \\tau)}{0!} = \\exp(-\\beta p N \\tau) $$\nsince $x^0=1$ and $0!=1$. Therefore, the fraction of females that become mated during the receptive window is:\n$$ F(N) = 1 - \\exp(-\\beta p N \\tau) $$\n\n2) Population model, Allee effect, and definition of $N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$.\nThe dynamics of the population $N(t)$ are determined by the balance of births and deaths. The per-capita growth rate is the per-capita birth rate minus the per-capita death rate. The maximum per-capita birth contribution is $b$, which is realized only if all females are mated. The actual per-capita birth rate is scaled by the fraction of mated females, $F(N)$. Furthermore, recruitment is limited by crowding via a linear factor $(1 - N/K)$. The background per-capita mortality rate is a constant, $d$.\nThe overall per-capita growth rate of the population, $g(N)$, is:\n$$ g(N) = \\frac{1}{N}\\frac{dN}{dt} = b F(N) \\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right) - d $$\nSubstituting the expression for $F(N)$ derived in part (1), we obtain the mechanistic population model:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = N \\left[ b \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\beta p N \\tau)\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right) - d \\right] $$\nA strong Allee effect is characterized by a negative per-capita growth rate at low population sizes. To verify this, we analyze the limit of $g(N)$ as $N$ approaches $0$ from the positive side.\n$$ \\lim_{N \\to 0^+} g(N) = \\lim_{N \\to 0^+} \\left[ b \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\beta p N \\tau)\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right) - d \\right] $$\nAs $N \\to 0^+$, the exponent $-\\beta p N \\tau \\to 0$, so $\\exp(-\\beta p N \\tau) \\to 1$. The term $(1 - \\exp(-\\beta p N \\tau))$ approaches $0$. The crowding term $(1 - N/K)$ approaches $1$. Therefore:\n$$ \\lim_{N \\to 0^+} g(N) = b \\cdot (0) \\cdot (1) - d = -d $$\nSince the mortality rate $d$ must be positive ($d > 0$), the per-capita growth rate is negative for sufficiently small $N$. This confirms the presence of a strong Allee effect: the population is unable to grow from very low densities and will decline towards extinction.\n\nThe equilibria of the system are the values of $N$ for which $\\frac{dN}{dt} = 0$. These are $N=0$ and the solutions to $g(N)=0$. The equilibrium at $N=0$ is stable because the growth rate is negative for $N \\to 0^+$. For the population to establish, the per-capita growth rate must become positive for some $N > 0$. This requires that the maximum possible growth rate, $b-d$ (achieved at low density but with full mating), is positive. Given $b > d$, there exists an unstable equilibrium $N_{\\mathrm{crit}} > 0$ that separates the region of population decline ($0 < N < N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$) from the region of initial growth ($N_{\\mathrm{crit}} < N < K$). This unstable equilibrium is the critical population size, or Allee threshold. By definition, $N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ is the non-zero solution to $g(N)=0$.\n$$ b \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\beta p N_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\tau)\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{K}\\right) - d = 0 $$\nThe existence of $N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ has significant implications for biological control. Mechanistically, if a release of agents results in an initial population $N_0 < N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, mate-finding limitation is so severe that the per-capita death rate $d$ exceeds the per-capita birth rate. The population declines to extinction. This provides a form of natural biocontainment, reducing the risk of establishment in non-target areas from a few dispersed individuals. This is a desirable property that reduces non-target exposure risk. Conversely, for the control program to succeed, the released population must establish, meaning $N_0$ must exceed $N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. If the release size is near the threshold ($N_0 \\approx N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$), the program's efficacy is compromised. Small, random negative fluctuations in population size (due to demographic stochasticity or environmental factors) can easily push the population below $N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, leading to unexpected establishment failure. This necessitates larger, more costly releases to ensure the population is robustly above the threshold.\n\n3) Derivation of the expression for $N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$.\nWe are asked to derive $N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ under the assumption that $N_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\ll K$. This assumption implies that for $N = N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, the crowding term $(1 - N_{\\mathrm{crit}}/K)$ can be approximated as $1$. The equation for $N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ simplifies to:\n$$ b \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\beta p N_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\tau)\\right) - d \\approx 0 $$\nWe now solve this equation for $N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$ 1 - \\exp(-\\beta p N_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\tau) = \\frac{d}{b} $$\n$$ \\exp(-\\beta p N_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\tau) = 1 - \\frac{d}{b} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -\\beta p N_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\tau = \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{d}{b}\\right) $$\nFinally, isolating $N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ yields the closed-form analytic expression:\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{crit}} = -\\frac{1}{\\beta p \\tau} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{d}{b}\\right) $$\nThis expression is physically meaningful only if $b > d$, which ensures the argument of the logarithm is positive and less than $1$, making the logarithm negative and thus $N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ positive.\n\n4) Computation of $N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$.\nWe use the derived expression for $N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ and the provided parameter values:\n$p = 0.5$ (dimensionless)\n$\\beta = 0.05$ individual$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$\n$\\tau = 0.08$ day\n$b = 0.4$ day$^{-1}$\n$d = 0.2$ day$^{-1}$\n$K = 10000$ individuals\n\nFirst, we calculate the product in the denominator:\n$$ \\beta p \\tau = (0.05)(0.5)(0.08) = 0.002 \\text{ individual}^{-1} $$\nNext, we calculate the term inside the logarithm:\n$$ 1 - \\frac{d}{b} = 1 - \\frac{0.2}{0.4} = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 $$\nNow we substitute these values into the expression for $N_{\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{crit}} = -\\frac{1}{0.002} \\ln(0.5) $$\nSince $\\ln(0.5) = \\ln(1/2) = -\\ln(2)$, this becomes:\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{crit}} = -\\frac{1}{0.002} (-\\ln(2)) = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.002} = 500 \\ln(2) $$\nUsing the value $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.69314718$, we compute the numerical result:\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\approx 500 \\times 0.69314718 = 346.57359... $$\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to four significant figures.\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\approx 346.6 $$\nThe unit is individuals. We check the initial assumption: $N_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 346.6$ is indeed much less than $K = 10000$, so the simplifying assumption used in the derivation was justified.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{346.6}\n$$", "id": "2473150"}]}
