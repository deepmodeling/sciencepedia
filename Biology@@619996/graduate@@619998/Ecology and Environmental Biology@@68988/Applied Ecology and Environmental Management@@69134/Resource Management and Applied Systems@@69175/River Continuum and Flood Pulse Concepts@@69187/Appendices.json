Since $1.23 > 1$, this reach is classified as **autotrophic**. In this model, the low flood pulse magnitude ($h=0.2$) limits the biomass for respiration, while sufficient light penetrates the water column despite canopy shading, allowing production to exceed respiration.\n\n- **Reach B:** $P\\!:\\!R_{\\text{B}} \\approx 1.01$. Since $1.01 > 1$, this reach is also classified as **autotrophic**. This aligns with the River Continuum Concept, where mid-order reaches with wider channels and less canopy cover often exhibit the highest rates of primary production.\n\n- **Reach C:** $P\\!:\\!R_{\\text{C}} \\approx 8.11 \\times 10^{-6}$. Since $8.11 \\times 10^{-6} \\ll 1$, this reach is classified as strongly **heterotrophic**. The extreme light limitation due to high depth ($z=6.0$) and turbidity ($\\kappa=2.0$) virtually eliminates primary production ($\\exp(-12)$ is a minuscule factor). Concurrently, high flood-pulse subsidy ($h=1.5$) supports a large respiring biomass, resulting in a system where respiration overwhelmingly dominates production. This is consistent with expectations for large, deep, turbid lowland rivers.\n\nThe final numerical answers for the $P\\!:\\!R$ ratios of the three reaches are thus $1.23$, $1.01$, and $8.11 \\times 10^{-6}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.23 & 1.01 & 8.11 \\times 10^{-6}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2530525"}, {"introduction": "River ecosystems are not passive conduits for water and nutrients; they are active biogeochemical reactors.

The total isotopic enrichment for each isotope is the product of the per-level enrichment factor and the number of transfers, i.e., $T \\cdot \\Delta_{\\mathrm{C}}$ for carbon and $T \\cdot \\Delta_{\\mathrm{N}}$ for nitrogen.\n\nThe mass balance relationship for each isotope is:\n$$ \\delta_{\\text{consumer}} = \\delta_{\\text{diet}} + \\text{total enrichment} $$\nThe diet's signature, $\\delta_{\\text{diet}}$, is the weighted average of the sources:\n$$ \\delta_{\\text{diet}} = f \\cdot \\delta_{\\text{source 1}} + (1-f) \\cdot \\delta_{\\text{source 2}} $$\nApplying this to our specific system for both carbon and nitrogen isotopes gives two equations:\n$$ \\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{fish}} = \\left( f \\cdot \\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{peri}} + (1-f) \\cdot \\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{terr}} \\right) + T \\cdot \\Delta_{\\mathrm{C}} $$\n$$ \\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{fish}} = \\left( f \\cdot \\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{peri}} + (1-f) \\cdot \\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{terr}} \\right) + T \\cdot \\Delta_{\\mathrm{N}} $$\nThese two equations contain two unknowns, $f$ and $T$. To solve for them, we rearrange the equations to isolate terms containing the unknowns on one side.\nFor the carbon isotope:\n$$ f \\cdot \\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{peri}} + \\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{terr}} - f \\cdot \\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{terr}} + T \\cdot \\Delta_{\\mathrm{C}} = \\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{fish}} $$\n$$ f \\cdot (\\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{peri}} - \\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{terr}}) + T \\cdot \\Delta_{\\mathrm{C}} = \\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{fish}} - \\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{terr}} $$\nFor the nitrogen isotope:\n$$ f \\cdot \\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{peri}} + \\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{terr}} - f \\cdot \\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{terr}} + T \\cdot \\Delta_{\\mathrm{N}} = \\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{fish}} $$\n$$ f \\cdot (\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{peri}} - \\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{terr}}) + T \\cdot \\Delta_{\\mathrm{N}} = \\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{fish}} - \\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{terr}} $$\nThis is a standard system of two linear equations in the variables $f$ and $T$. We can express this in matrix form, $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{x} = [f, T]^\\top$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n(\\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{peri}} - \\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{terr}}) & \\Delta_{\\mathrm{C}} \\\\\n(\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{peri}} - \\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{terr}}) & \\Delta_{\\mathrm{N}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nf \\\\\nT\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n(\\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{fish}} - \\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{terr}}) \\\\\n(\\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{fish}} - \\delta^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{terr}})\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSolving this system yields a unique solution for the vector $\\mathbf{x}$, provided the coefficient matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is non-singular (i.e., its determinant is non-zero). The first element of the solution vector is the desired fraction, $f$.\n\nThe physical constraint that $f$ must represent a proportion requires that the calculated value be constrained to the closed interval $[0, 1]$. Values of $f < 0$ or $f > 1$ are physically meaningless and indicate that the consumer's isotopic signature lies outside the mixing polygon defined by the sources and corrected for trophic enrichment. Such results can arise from measurement error, unaccounted-for dietary sources, or spatiotemporal variation in source or trophic enrichment factor values. As per the problem's requirements, the calculated solution for $f$ is clipped to enforce this constraint. The final implementation will solve this linear system for each test case, clip the resulting $f$ to the range $[0, 1]$, and format the output as specified.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\text{[0.681,1.000,0.000,1.000,0.594]} } $$", "id": "2530551"}]}
