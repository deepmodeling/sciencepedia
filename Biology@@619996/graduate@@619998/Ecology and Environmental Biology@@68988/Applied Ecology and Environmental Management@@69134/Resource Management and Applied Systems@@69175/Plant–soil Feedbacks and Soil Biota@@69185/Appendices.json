More importantly, it challenges you to interpret the sign of the result, linking a simple number to profound ecological consequences like community stability and coexistence.", "problem": "Two plant species, denoted $A$ and $B$, were assayed in a reciprocal soil-conditioning experiment to quantify plant–soil feedback (PSF). Each species was first grown to condition a live microbial community in sterilized field soil. Then, in a subsequent assay phase, seedlings of each species were transplanted into soils conditioned by either conspecifics or heterospecifics. For each combination, the response variable is a dimensionless per-capita performance factor $P_{ij} > 0$ (mean relative biomass per plant over the assay interval, normalized to a sterilized uninoculated control), where $i \\in \\{A,B\\}$ indexes the focal species and $j \\in \\{A,B\\}$ indexes the conditioner species. By convention in PSF models, multiplicative performance factors $P_{ij}$ are converted to additive per-capita effects via $\\alpha_{ij} = \\ln P_{ij}$.\n\nThe data obtained are:\n- $P_{AA} = 0.82$\n- $P_{AB} = 1.05$\n- $P_{BA} = 0.96$\n- $P_{BB} = 0.74$\n\nUsing the conceptual definition that the two-species Bever-type PSF coefficient aggregates, across species, the conspecific-versus-heterospecific difference in the soil-biota-mediated per-capita effect, proceed from first principles to express the feedback coefficient purely in terms of the $P_{ij}$ and compute its numerical value from the data above. Then, interpret the sign of your result in terms of whether PSF tends to stabilize coexistence through negative frequency dependence or tends to generate positive feedback and priority effects.\n\nReport the feedback coefficient as a pure number (dimensionless), and round your final numerical answer to $4$ significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of a two-species plant-soil feedback (PSF) coefficient, followed by an interpretation of its sign. The validation of the problem statement is the mandatory first step.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the established ecological theory of plant-soil feedbacks, specifically referencing the Bever model framework. It provides a clear, objective task with all necessary data. The given performance factors, $P_{ij}$, are dimensionless and positive, which is consistent with their definition as normalized relative biomass. The logarithmic transformation $\\alpha_{ij} = \\ln P_{ij}$ is a standard method to convert multiplicative effects into an additive scale for linear modeling. The problem is well-posed, self-contained, and free of scientific or logical contradictions. It is therefore deemed valid.\n\nWe proceed to the solution. The problem defines the PSF coefficient as an aggregation, across species, of the \"conspecific-versus-heterospecific difference in the soil-biota-mediated per-capita effect.\" Let us formalize this definition.\n\nThe per-capita effect of the soil biota on a plant of species $i$ grown in soil conditioned by species $j$ is given by $\\alpha_{ij} = \\ln P_{ij}$.\n\nFor the focal species $A$ (where $i=A$), the per-capita effect from its own (conspecific) soil is $\\alpha_{AA}$. The per-capita effect from the other (heterospecific) species' soil is $\\alpha_{AB}$. The \"conspecific-versus-heterospecific difference\" for species $A$ is therefore the difference between these two effects:\n$$ \\Delta_A = \\alpha_{AA} - \\alpha_{AB} $$\n\nSimilarly, for the focal species $B$ (where $i=B$), the conspecific effect is $\\alpha_{BB}$ and the heterospecific effect is $\\alpha_{BA}$. The corresponding difference for species $B$ is:\n$$ \\Delta_B = \\alpha_{BB} - \\alpha_{BA} $$\n\nThe problem states that the overall feedback coefficient aggregates these differences across species. In the context of PSF interaction models, \"aggregation\" implies summation. Let us denote the two-species feedback coefficient as $\\Psi$.\n$$ \\Psi = \\Delta_A + \\Delta_B = (\\alpha_{AA} - \\alpha_{AB}) + (\\alpha_{BB} - \\alpha_{BA}) $$\nThis expression represents the total net feedback in the two-species community.\n\nTo express this coefficient purely in terms of the given performance factors $P_{ij}$, we substitute the definition $\\alpha_{ij} = \\ln P_{ij}$:\n$$ \\Psi = (\\ln P_{AA} - \\ln P_{AB}) + (\\ln P_{BB} - \\ln P_{BA}) $$\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, specifically $\\ln x - \\ln y = \\ln(x/y)$ and $\\ln x + \\ln y = \\ln(xy)$, we can simplify this expression:\n$$ \\Psi = \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{AA}}{P_{AB}}\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{BB}}{P_{BA}}\\right) $$\n$$ \\Psi = \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{AA} P_{BB}}{P_{AB} P_{BA}}\\right) $$\nThis is the final expression for the feedback coefficient in terms of the $P_{ij}$ values. It is often referred to in literature as the net feedback index or interaction strength, $I_s$.\n\nNow, we compute its numerical value using the provided data:\n$P_{AA} = 0.82$\n$P_{AB} = 1.05$\n$P_{BA} = 0.96$\n$P_{BB} = 0.74$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$ \\Psi = \\ln\\left(\\frac{(0.82) \\times (0.74)}{(1.05) \\times (0.96)}\\right) $$\n$$ \\Psi = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.6068}{1.008}\\right) $$\n$$ \\Psi = \\ln(0.60198412698...) $$\n$$ \\Psi \\approx -0.5075306... $$\n\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, the numerical value of the feedback coefficient is $-0.5075$.\n\nFinally, we must interpret the sign of this result. The coefficient $\\Psi$ is negative. A negative value for $\\Psi$ implies that $\\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{AA} P_{BB}}{P_{AB} P_{BA}}\\right) < 0$, which in turn means $\\frac{P_{AA} P_{BB}}{P_{AB} P_{BA}} < 1$, or $P_{AA} P_{BB} < P_{AB} P_{BA}$. This inequality shows that the product of the performances of the two species in heterospecific soils is greater than the product of their performances in conspecific soils.\n\nLooking at the additive form, $\\Psi = (\\alpha_{AA} - \\alpha_{AB}) + (\\alpha_{BB} - \\alpha_{BA}) < 0$, we can see that, on average, each species performs more poorly in soil conditioned by its own species than in soil conditioned by the other species. This is the definition of negative plant-soil feedback. For species $A$, the feedback is $\\ln(P_{AA}/P_{AB}) = \\ln(0.82/1.05) < 0$. For species $B$, the feedback is $\\ln(P_{BB}/P_{BA}) = \\ln(0.74/0.96) < 0$. Both species suffer from negative conspecific feedback relative to heterospecific interactions.\n\nIn population dynamics, this creates negative frequency dependence. When a species becomes abundant, its own self-limiting soil environment (e.g., accumulation of host-specific pathogens) also becomes widespread. This puts the common species at a disadvantage relative to the rare species, which benefits from encountering more heterospecific soil. This mechanism gives the rare species a growth advantage, preventing it from being eliminated and thus stabilizing coexistence between the two species.\n\nConversely, a positive value ($\\Psi > 0$) would indicate positive plant-soil feedback, where each species facilitates its own growth more than it facilitates the other's. This leads to positive frequency dependence and priority effects, where the species that starts with a higher abundance tends to competitively exclude the other, destabilizing coexistence.\n\nTherefore, the negative sign of the calculated coefficient indicates that the plant-soil feedback in this system tends to stabilize coexistence through negative frequency dependence.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-0.5075} $$", "id": "2522444"}, {"introduction": "The quantitative indices we calculate are only as reliable as the experiments that produce the data.

Your task is to act as a reviewer, critically dissecting each design to identify which ones correctly implement a \"home-versus-away\" comparison while rigorously avoiding the pitfall of pseudoreplication.", "problem": "You are tasked with quantifying plant–soil feedback (PSF) in a greenhouse for a community of $s = 4$ perennial plant species using a two-phase design. In the conditioning phase, each species is grown in monoculture to condition soil biota. In the feedback phase, seedlings of each species are planted into pots containing a sterile background substrate amended with a small volume fraction of live inoculum derived from the conditioning phase. Your objectives are to implement a valid home–away scheme (where “home” means conspecific-conditioned inoculum and “away” means heterospecific-conditioned inoculum) and to avoid pseudoreplication of soil inocula. Pseudoreplication is defined as the use of non-independent subsamples as if they were independent replicates of the treatment. You have resources to grow $n \\ge 5$ independent conditioning pots per species and to assemble a balanced set of test pots. Select all protocols below that simultaneously (i) implement a valid home–away PSF comparison and (ii) avoid pseudoreplication of inocula.\n\nA. Two-phase design with independent donor identity retained. Conditioning phase: grow each species in $n$ independent monoculture pots on sterile substrate, then harvest and keep inoculum from each conditioning pot separate. Feedback phase: assemble test pots with sterile background substrate amended with exactly $10\\%$ (by volume) live inoculum. For each test species, create “home” pots by inoculating each test pot with the live inoculum from a single, unique conspecific conditioning pot (no pooling and no reuse of that inoculum across multiple test pots), and create “away” pots by inoculating each test pot with inoculum from a single, unique heterospecific conditioning pot, distributing away donors evenly across heterospecific species. Randomize positions and block as needed. Analyze with a model that treats donor identity as a random effect nested within donor species.\n\nB. Species-level composite inocula. Conditioning phase: grow $n$ conditioning pots per species, then pool all $n$ pots of a species into one composite inoculum per species. Feedback phase: for each test species, create “home” and “away” pots by inoculating $20$ pots per category from the relevant species-level composite. Treat the $20$ pots per category as $20$ replicates in analysis.\n\nC. Community-conditioned soils. Conditioning phase: grow mixed-species stands where all $4$ species are planted together in each pot and allowed to sort naturally. Define “home” for a test species as inoculum harvested from mixed stands where that test species visually comprises the majority of biomass; define “away” as inoculum harvested from mixed stands where a different species is the majority. Use $n$ mixed stands per species majority class and keep inocula separate.\n\nD. Blocked composite donors with retained replication. Field-based conditioning: for each species, in each of $b = 3$ spatial blocks, collect rhizosphere soil from $k = 4$ distinct field individuals and pool within block to form one block-level composite inoculum per species (yielding $3$ independent donor composites per species). Feedback phase: assemble test pots with sterile background substrate and amend each pot with $10\\%$ live inoculum from a single, unique block-level composite. For each test species, create “home” pots from conspecific block-level composites and “away” pots from heterospecific block-level composites, balanced across blocks and donor species. Do not reuse any composite for more than one test pot per test species. Analyze with block-level composite identity as a random effect and block as a factor.\n\nE. Subsampling a single donor. Conditioning phase: grow $n$ pots per species, select one conditioning pot per species as the donor, and split its inoculum into $q = 10$ equal portions. Feedback phase: use those $q$ subsamples to inoculate $q$ test pots for “home” and another $q$ for “away,” and treat all $q$ pots as independent replicates in analysis because the subsamples occupy different pots and bench positions.\n\nChoose all that apply.", "solution": "The problem requires the identification of experimental protocols that satisfy two criteria for a plant-soil feedback (PSF) study: (i) implementation of a valid home–away comparison, and (ii) avoidance of pseudoreplication. A valid home–away comparison, as per the problem statement, involves contrasting the effects of inoculum from a conspecific monoculture (\"home\") with that from a heterospecific monoculture (\"away\"). Pseudoreplication is explicitly defined as using non-independent subsamples as if they were independent replicates. In this context, the experimental unit for the soil conditioning treatment is an independently conditioned pot of soil. True replication requires multiple such independent units. Subsampling a single unit, or a single pooled composite, and treating the subsamples as independent replicates is the fundamental error of pseudoreplication. The study involves $s = 4$ plant species and at least $n \\ge 5$ conditioning pots per species.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option against these two criteria.\n\nA. Two-phase design with independent donor identity retained.\nThis protocol describes growing $n$ independent conditioning pots for each of the $s = 4$ species. Critically, the inoculum from each of these $n$ pots is kept separate. In the feedback phase, each test pot is inoculated with soil from a single, unique conditioning pot. A test plant of a given species receives \"home\" inoculum from one of its conspecific conditioning pots and \"away\" inoculum from a heterospecific conditioning pot.\n(i) Home–Away Comparison: This design correctly implements the home–away comparison using inocula from monocultures. This criterion is met.\n(ii) Pseudoreplication: The unit of replication is the individual conditioning pot. By keeping inocula from each of the $n$ conditioning pots separate and using them to inoculate individual test pots, the design maintains $n$ true, independent replicates for each conditioning species. The proposed statistical analysis, which treats donor pot identity as a random effect, correctly accounts for the variation among these true replicates. This protocol is the ideal design to avoid pseudoreplication. This criterion is met.\nTherefore, this option is **Correct**.\n\nB. Species-level composite inoculi.\nThis protocol involves pooling the soil from all $n$ conditioning pots of a given species into a single, large composite inoculum for that species. Feedback pots are then created by taking subsamples from these species-level composites. The analysis proposes treating the $20$ resulting test pots as $20$ independent replicates.\n(i) Home–Away Comparison: The design contrasts \"home\" soil (from the conspecific composite) with \"away\" soil (from a heterospecific composite). This criterion is met.\n(ii) Pseudoreplication: This design commits a classic error of pseudoreplication. By pooling all $n$ independent conditioning pots, the true replication is lost. All subsamples drawn from a single composite are non-independent; they are subsamples of a single experimental unit (the composite itself). The true number of replicates for the conditioning treatment is $N=1$ per species. Treating the $20$ test pots as $20$ replicates fatally inflates the degrees of freedom for the statistical test, leading to an artificially small error term and a high probability of a Type I error (falsely detecting a significant effect). This criterion is not met.\nTherefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Community-conditioned soils.\nThis protocol uses conditioning in mixed-species stands, not monocultures. \"Home\" is defined as soil from a plot where the test species is dominant, and \"away\" is soil where a different species is dominant.\n(i) Home–Away Comparison: The problem statement explicitly defines the conditioning phase as growing each species in monoculture. This protocol violates this fundamental premise. It tests a different, though potentially interesting, hypothesis about community dominance, not the standard conspecific-monoculture versus heterospecific-monoculture PSF effect. This criterion is not met.\n(ii) Pseudoreplication: The analysis is secondary, as the first criterion is not met.\nTherefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Blocked composite donors with retained replication.\nThis protocol describes a field-based conditioning phase, which is a departure from the greenhouse setting in the main problem description. However, the logical structure of the experimental design is what must be evaluated. In each of $b=3$ spatial blocks, soil from $k=4$ individuals of a species is pooled to create a block-level composite. This procedure yields $3$ independent composite inocula per species. In the feedback phase, each test pot is inoculated from a single, unique block-level composite.\n(i) Home–Away Comparison: The design correctly contrasts \"home\" (conspecific block-level composite) and \"away\" (heterospecific block-level composite) inocula. This criterion is met.\n(ii) Pseudoreplication: This is a sophisticated design that correctly manages replication. The key is that the pooling occurs *within* blocks, but the blocks themselves are independent. The experimental units for the conditioning treatment are the $b=3$ independent block-level composites for each species. By using these composites as the source of inoculum for different test pots and analyzing the data with `block` and `composite identity` as factors, the design maintains true replication. The true number of replicates for the soil conditioning treatment per species is $b=3$. This protocol successfully avoids pseudoreplication by creating and maintaining independent composite replicates. This criterion is met.\nTherefore, this option is **Correct**.\n\nE. Subsampling a single donor.\nThis protocol involves selecting only one conditioning pot per species. The inoculum from this single pot is then subdivided into $q=10$ portions to create $q=10$ test pots, which are then treated as independent replicates in the analysis.\n(i) Home–Away Comparison: A contrast is made between soil from a single conspecific pot and a single heterospecific pot. This criterion is met.\n(ii) Pseudoreplication: This is an extreme case of pseudoreplication. The true number of replicates for the conditioning treatment is $N=1$. The $q=10$ test pots are simply subsamples (pseudoreplicates) of this single conditioning unit. The justification that they are independent because they are in different physical pots is a fallacy; their inocula are not independently derived. This design makes it impossible to distinguish the effect of the treatment (e.g., species 1 conditioning) from the idiosyncratic properties of the single donor pot chosen. This criterion is not met.\nTherefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, only protocols A and D correctly implement a valid home-away comparison while properly managing replication to avoid pseudoreplication.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2522447"}, {"introduction": "Beyond measuring the net effect of PSFs, a key goal of advanced ecological research is to disentangle the multiple mechanisms that may be operating simultaneously. For instance, the decline in plant performance at high densities could be due to specialized natural enemies (a classic PSF mechanism) or simple resource competition. This advanced practice [@problem_id:2522485] explores how to design an experiment to separate these confounding factors in the field. It highlights the power of factorial designs, where manipulating conspecific density and pathogen pressure (via fungicide) allows us to use statistical interactions to attribute effects to specific mechanisms.", "problem": "In a species-rich tropical forest understory, you are interested in testing whether declines in seedling recruitment with increasing local seed density are primarily driven by conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) mediated by soil-borne natural enemies, or by resource competition among seedlings. You have access to a broad-spectrum foliar-safe soil fungicide that reduces infection by common oomycete and fungal pathogens without directly adding resources. You also can add seeds to marked microplots.\n\nFoundational facts and definitions:\n- CNDD is defined as a decline in per-capita seedling performance with increasing local conspecific density caused by host-specific natural enemies (for example, soil-borne pathogens and antagonists) rather than by reductions in shared limiting resources.\n- Resource competition predicts a decline in performance with increasing total plant density due to finite resource supply, and should not be directly altered by a fungicide if the fungicide does not change resource availability.\n- In a factorial design, an interaction between factors indicates that the effect of one factor depends on the level of another factor.\n\nSuppose you can implement a randomized block field experiment with replicated microplots. Let $D$ denote the sown conspecific seed density per microplot, with $k \\geq 3$ levels spanning the natural range for the focal species, and let $F \\in \\{0,1\\}$ indicate fungicide treatment ($F=1$) or water control ($F=0$). Let $s(D,F)$ denote the per-seed probability of recruitment to a fixed census date. Background vegetation can be standardized by lightly weeding and adding a uniform layer of sterilized mulch to equalize microclimate without adding nutrients. Seed batches are viability-tested so that the effective input density is known. Pathogen pressure can be validated by plating a subsample of roots to estimate infection prevalence $\\pi(F)$ under each treatment.\n\nWhich experimental design and inferential logic would most cleanly separate CNDD from resource competition using only seed addition and fungicide treatments in this setting?\n\nA. Establish a $2 \\times k$ factorial with $F \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and conspecific seed density levels $D \\in \\{D_1,\\dots,D_k\\}$ in each of $n$ randomized blocks, measure $s(D,F)$, and fit a generalized linear model for $s$ with terms for $D$, $F$, and the $D \\times F$ interaction. Conclude CNDD via soil biota if the negative slope of $s$ versus $D$ is significantly weaker under $F=1$ than under $F=0$ (that is, the $D \\times F$ interaction coefficient is positive and significantly different from zero), and conclude resource competition if a negative slope with $D$ persists with similar magnitude under both $F$ levels (no interaction), given that $\\pi(1) \\ll \\pi(0)$ validates pathogen suppression.\n\nB. Establish a $2 \\times k$ factorial as above, but diagnose CNDD solely from a significant positive main effect of $F$ on $s$ (higher mean recruitment under $F=1$ than $F=0$), regardless of the relationship with $D$.

Sow seeds at a single high density $D^\\ast$ in plots with and without fungicide and compare $s(D^\\ast,1)$ versus $s(D^\\ast,0)$.

Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) is a mechanism in which per-capita performance declines with increasing local conspecific density due to host-specific natural enemies. Thus, if a fungicide suppresses these enemies, the strength of the negative relationship between performance and conspecific density should be reduced under fungicide. By contrast, resource competition is driven by finite resource supply and should depend on total density but not be directly altered by a fungicide that does not change resource availability. Therefore, to separate these mechanisms using only seed addition and fungicide, one must (i) manipulate conspecific density across multiple levels, (ii) manipulate pathogen pressure with fungicide versus control, (iii) standardize non-focal sources of variation in resources as much as possible, and (iv) test for an interaction between density and fungicide on performance $s(D,F)$.\n\nA factorial design with $F \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and $k \\geq 3$ levels of $D$ allows us to estimate whether the slope $\\partial s / \\partial D$ depends on $F$. If CNDD via soil biota is present, $s(D,0)$ should decline more steeply with $D$ than $s(D,1)$, implying a significant $D \\times F$ interaction. If resource competition is the main driver, the decline with $D$ should be similar under both $F$ levels, implying no interaction, though a main effect of $D$ may still be negative. Validation that pathogen pressure is indeed reduced under $F=1$ via $\\pi(1) \\ll \\pi(0)$ strengthens inference. This logic follows from the definition of interaction in factorial experiments: when the effect of $D$ depends on $F$, we attribute the difference to the mechanism altered by $F$, here soil pathogens.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This option prescribes a $2 \\times k$ factorial crossing fungicide and multiple densities, randomization across $n$ blocks, and analysis of $s(D,F)$ with terms for $D$, $F$, and the $D \\times F$ interaction. The inferential criterion is that a positive $D \\times F$ interaction coefficient (that is, a weaker negative density effect under $F=1$) indicates that fungicide alleviates the density-dependent decline, consistent with CNDD mediated by soil biota. If the negative density effect persists with similar magnitude under both $F$ levels (no interaction), that supports resource competition as the primary driver. The inclusion of pathogen validation via $\\pi(1) \\ll \\pi(0)$ ensures that the fungicide actually altered the target mechanism. This design and logic cleanly separate the mechanisms under the stated constraints. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. This option focuses on the main effect of $F$ only. A positive main effect of fungicide on average $s$ could arise even if the density effect is unchanged (for example, general release from background disease pressure), and without testing how the slope with respect to $D$ changes, one cannot attribute density dependence to CNDD. The central question is not whether pathogens matter on average, but whether the relationship between $s$ and $D$ is altered by pathogen suppression. Ignoring the $D \\times F$ interaction conflates mechanisms and fails to separate CNDD from resource competition. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. This option varies $F$ at a single high density $D^\\ast$ and infers mechanism from a difference in $s(D^\\ast,1)$ versus $s(D^\\ast,0)$. Without a series of $D$ levels, one cannot estimate how the slope with respect to density changes under $F$, so CNDD (defined by a density-dependent effect) cannot be isolated. Moreover, resource competition at $D^\\ast$ could mask or mimic pathogen effects at that single point, and any difference might reflect baseline disease pressure rather than density dependence. Thus, this design does not separate CNDD from resource competition. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. Holding total density constant and mixing species can control total resource demand, but attributing any difference between conspecific-only and mixed plots to CNDD without reference to the $D \\times F$ interaction is not justified. Both resource competition and natural enemies can produce conspecific disadvantages in mixtures; without using the fungicide to test whether those disadvantages are pathogen-mediated, and without assessing how per-capita performance changes across multiple conspecific densities, the design cannot cleanly separate mechanisms. While adding $F$ could, in principle, be used to test for pathogen mediation, this option explicitly ignores the interaction-based logic required to separate CNDD from resource competition and relies on a single total density. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, only option A both uses seed addition and fungicide within a factorial framework and applies the correct interaction-based inference to distinguish CNDD from resource competition.\n\nAs an additional note on analysis consistent with option A, one could fit a generalized linear model such as a binomial logistic regression for recruitment:\n$$\n\\log\\left(\\frac{s(D,F)}{1 - s(D,F)}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_D D + \\beta_F F + \\beta_{DF} (D \\times F) + b_{\\text{block}},\n$$\nwhere $b_{\\text{block}}$ is a random intercept for block. Evidence for CNDD via pathogens would be $\\beta_D < 0$ and $\\beta_{DF} > 0$ with $\\beta_{DF}$ significantly different from zero, along with confirmation that pathogen prevalence satisfies $\\pi(1) \\ll \\pi(0)$. If $\\beta_D < 0$ but $\\beta_{DF} \\approx 0$, resource competition is implicated as the dominant mechanism unaffected by fungicide.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2522485"}]}
