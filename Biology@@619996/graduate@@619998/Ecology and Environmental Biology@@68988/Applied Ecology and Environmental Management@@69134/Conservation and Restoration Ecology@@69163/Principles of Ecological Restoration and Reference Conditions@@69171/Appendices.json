It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fire ecology and restoration, well-posed with clear definitions and procedural rules, and objective in its formulation. All necessary data and constraints are provided to compute a unique, verifiable solution. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to operationalize the ecological concept of the Natural Range of Variation (NRV) for fire management. Given a reference dataset of historical fire return intervals (FRI), we first characterize its statistical properties. Then, based on the current state of a management unit, we derive actionable burn targets. This process involves three main stages: computation of the NRV, determination of a target FRI, and calculation of a corresponding management prescription.\n\n**1. Characterization of the Natural Range of Variation (NRV)**\n\nThe NRV provides a statistical benchmark for assessing the current condition of an ecosystem. For the Fire Return Interval, a random variable, we are given a sample of $n$ observations, $\\{\\text{FRI}_1, \\text{FRI}_2, \\dots, \\text{FRI}_n\\}$. The NRV is defined as the central $90\\%$ interval of the probability distribution of FRI. We employ a non-parametric approach, which avoids making assumptions about the underlying distribution (e.g., Weibull, log-normal).\n\nThe NRV is specified by the interval $[q_{0.05}, q_{0.95}]$, where $q_p$ is the $p$-th quantile of the empirical distribution. The median, $q_{0.5}$, represents the central tendency. The quantiles are calculated from the sorted sample data, $x_{(1)} \\le x_{(2)} \\le \\dots \\le x_{(n)}$. The position of the $p$-th quantile is determined by an index $i = p \\cdot (n-1)$. If $i$ is not an integer, linear interpolation is used between the values at the floor and ceiling of this index:\n$$q_p = x_{(\\lfloor i \\rfloor+1)} + (i - \\lfloor i \\rfloor) \\cdot (x_{(\\lfloor i \\rfloor+2)} - x_{(\\lfloor i \\rfloor+1)})$$\nwhere array indices are 1-based for this formula. In a 0-indexed computational framework, the index is $k = \\lfloor i \\rfloor$ and the formula becomes $q_p = x_{(k)} + (i-k) \\cdot (x_{(k+1)} - x_{(k)})$. This method provides a robust estimate of the quantiles.\n\n**2. Derivation of Restoration Targets**\n\nThe restoration targets are derived from the NRV and the current time since last fire, $t$. The logic aims to guide the system back toward the reference conditions defined by the NRV.\n\nFirst, a target planning FRI, $\\tau^\\star$, is established. This represents the desired average interval between fires for future management cycles. The rules are as follows:\n- If $t < q_{0.05}$: The system has been burning too frequently relative to its historical regime. To allow for fuel accumulation and ecosystem recovery, the target FRI is set to the lower bound of the NRV, $\\tau^\\star = q_{0.05}$. This lengthens the next fire-free interval.\n- If $q_{0.05} \\le t \\le q_{0.95}$: The system is within its NRV. The management goal shifts from correction to maintenance. The target is set to the median FRI, $\\tau^\\star = q_{0.5}$, to aim for the central tendency of the historical regime.\n- If $t > q_{0.95}$: The system has experienced fire suppression or an unusually long fire-free period, leading to high fuel loads and potential for uncharacteristic fire effects. The deviation from NRV requires correction. The long-term target is the median, $\\tau^\\star = q_{0.5}$, but the immediate priority is to reintroduce fire.\n\nSecond, the time to the next prescribed burn, $\\Delta$, is determined. This quantifies the urgency of the intervention.\n- If $t < q_{0.05}$: A waiting period is necessary. The next burn is scheduled in $\\Delta = q_{0.05} - t$ years, ensuring the next interval is at least $q_{0.05}$.\n- If $q_{0.05} \\le t \\le q_{0.5}$: The system is within the lower part of the NRV. The burn is scheduled to achieve a median interval, so $\\Delta = q_{0.5} - t$.\n- If $t > q_{0.5}$: The system is in the upper part of its NRV or has exceeded it. The ecological need for fire is considered immediate to prevent further departure from reference conditions. Therefore, the next burn should occur as soon as possible, which is modeled as $\\Delta = 0$ years.\n\n**3. Calculation of Management Prescription**\n\nThe temporal targets ($\\tau^\\star$ and $\\Delta$) must be translated into a spatial management plan. Assuming a renewal process where fires occur randomly with an average rate, the annual treatment rate, $r$, required to achieve a mean FRI of $\\tau^\\star$ is simply its reciprocal:\n$$r = \\frac{1}{\\tau^\\star}$$\nThis rate has units of year$^{-1}$ and is expressed as a decimal. For a management area of total size $A$ (in hectares), the annual area to be burned, $B$, is:\n$$B = A \\cdot r = \\frac{A}{\\tau^\\star}$$\nThis yields a target in hectares per year, which is a concrete objective for operational planning.\n\nAll final numerical results are rounded to the precision specified in the problem statement.
