The final numeric answer must be the cumulative least-cost distance only.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It represents a classic application of graph theory to landscape ecology, specifically the calculation of a least-cost path on a resistance surface. The problem is valid and a unique solution for the minimum cost can be determined.\n\nThe problem is equivalent to finding the shortest path in a weighted, undirected graph. The nodes of the graph are the centers of the $25$ cells in the $5 \\times 5$ raster. An edge exists between any two nodes if their corresponding cells are $8$-neighbors (i.e., they share a side or a corner).\n\nThe cost, or weight, of traversing an edge between two cells, say cell $A$ at coordinates $(i_A, j_A)$ and cell $B$ at $(i_B, j_B)$, is defined by the isotropic cost-distance formula:\n$$w(A, B) = \\frac{\\mathbf{C}_{i_A, j_A} + \\mathbf{C}_{i_B, j_B}}{2} \\times d(A,B)$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{C}_{i,j}$ is the resistance cost of the cell at row $i$ and column $j$, and $d(A,B)$ is the Euclidean distance between the cell centers. Given a normalized cell size, the distance $d(A,B)$ is $1$ for orthogonal neighbors (sharing a side) and $\\sqrt{2}$ for diagonal neighbors (sharing a corner). Since all cell costs $\\mathbf{C}_{i,j}$ are positive, all edge weights $w(A,B)$ are positive.\n\nTo find the least-cost path from the start cell $(1,1)$ to the target cell $(5,5)$, we will use Dijkstra's algorithm. Let $D(i,j)$ denote the cumulative least-cost distance from the start cell $(1,1)$ to cell $(i,j)$.\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    The cost to the start cell is zero: $D(1,1) = 0$. The costs to all other cells are initialized to infinity: $D(i,j) = \\infty$ for $(i,j) \\neq (1,1)$. A priority queue, $Q$, is initialized with the start node: $Q = \\{(1,1)\\}$.\n\n2.  **Execution of Dijkstra's Algorithm**:\n    The algorithm iteratively selects the unvisited node with the smallest cumulative cost and updates the costs of its neighbors.\n\n    -   **Step 1**: Extract $(1,1)$ from $Q$. Its cost is $D(1,1)=0$. We update its neighbors:\n        -   Cell $(1,2)$ (orthogonal): $D(1,2) = D(1,1) + \\frac{\\mathbf{C}_{1,1} + \\mathbf{C}_{1,2}}{2} \\times 1 = 0 + \\frac{1+1}{2} \\times 1 = 1$.\n        -   Cell $(2,1)$ (orthogonal): $D(2,1) = D(1,1) + \\frac{\\mathbf{C}_{1,1} + \\mathbf{C}_{2,1}}{2} \\times 1 = 0 + \\frac{1+1}{2} \\times 1 = 1$.\n        -   Cell $(2,2)$ (diagonal): $D(2,2) = D(1,1) + \\frac{\\mathbf{C}_{1,1} + \\mathbf{C}_{2,2}}{2} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 0 + \\frac{1+1}{2} \\times \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$.\n        The nodes $(1,2)$, $(2,1)$, and $(2,2)$ are added to $Q$.\n\n    -   **Step 2**: The nodes $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$ have the lowest cost ($1$) in $Q$. We can expand from them. Expanding from these nodes reveals that any path to $(2,2)$ through them is more costly than the direct diagonal path. For instance, the path $(1,1) \\to (1,2) \\to (2,2)$ has a cost of $D(1,2) + \\frac{\\mathbf{C}_{1,2}+\\mathbf{C}_{2,2}}{2} \\times 1 = 1 + \\frac{1+1}{2} \\times 1 = 2$, which is greater than $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n    -   **Step 3**: The next node extracted from $Q$ is $(2,2)$ with cost $D(2,2) = \\sqrt{2}$. We examine its unvisited neighbors. The most promising path leads towards the diagonal, to cell $(3,3)$ which also has a low resistance cost of $\\mathbf{C}_{3,3}=1$.\n        -   Cost to $(3,3)$ (diagonal): $D(3,3) = D(2,2) + \\frac{\\mathbf{C}_{2,2} + \\mathbf{C}_{3,3}}{2} \\times \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1+1}{2} \\times \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{2} = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n        Any path from $(2,2)$ to its other neighbors, such as $(2,3)$ or $(3,2)$ (which have cost $\\mathbf{C}=2$), will result in a higher per-step cost. For example, the cost to reach $(2,3)$ is $D(2,2) + \\frac{\\mathbf{C}_{2,2}+\\mathbf{C}_{2,3}}{2} \\times 1 = \\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1+2}{2} = \\sqrt{2} + 1.5 \\approx 2.914$. The cost to $(3,3)$ is $2\\sqrt{2} \\approx 2.828$, which is lower.\n\n    -   **Step 4**: The algorithm continues, preferentially expanding along the path of least resistance. The costs for reaching subsequent cells along the main diagonal are:\n        -   From $(3,3)$ to $(4,4)$: The node $(3,3)$ is eventually extracted from $Q$ with cost $D(3,3)=2\\sqrt{2}$. The cost to its neighbor $(4,4)$ is updated:\n        $D(4,4) = D(3,3) + \\frac{\\mathbf{C}_{3,3} + \\mathbf{C}_{4,4}}{2} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 2\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1+1}{2} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\n        -   From $(4,4)$ to $(5,5)$: The node $(4,4)$ is eventually extracted with cost $D(4,4)=3\\sqrt{2}$. The cost to the target cell $(5,5)$ is updated:\n        $D(5,5) = D(4,4) + \\frac{\\mathbf{C}_{4,4} + \\mathbf{C}_{5,5}}{2} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 3\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1+1}{2} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 4\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n3.  **Path Reconstruction and Final Cost**:\n    The algorithm will continue until $(5,5)$ is extracted from the priority queue as the node with the minimum cost among all unvisited nodes. A rigorous check confirms that no alternative path yields a lower cost than $4\\sqrt{2}$. For example, any deviation from this diagonal path of cost-$1$ cells necessitates traversing cells with higher resistance ($2$ or $8$) or taking more expensive orthogonal steps between cost-$1$ cells, both of which increase the total path cost.\n\n    The least-cost path is therefore the sequence of diagonal cells from the top-left to the bottom-right corner:\n    $$ (1,1) \\to (2,2) \\to (3,3) \\to (4,4) \\to (5,5) $$\n    The total cumulative cost is the sum of the four identical diagonal edge weights:\n    $$ \\text{Total Cost} = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{2} = 4\\sqrt{2} $$\n\n4.  **Numerical Answer**:\n    The problem requires the cumulative least-cost distance rounded to four significant figures.\n    $$ 4\\sqrt{2} \\approx 4 \\times 1.41421356 = 5.65685424 $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures gives $5.657$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.657}$$", "id": "2496843"}, {"introduction": "Connectivity is often seen as a universal good in conservation, but can it be detrimental?

This corresponds to the extinction of the population in both patches. This is a valid nonnegative equilibrium.\n\nTo find any non-trivial equilibria, we analyze the zero-growth isoclines of the system. An isocline is the set of points $(N_1, N_2)$ where one of the derivatives is zero. An equilibrium must lie at the intersection of all isoclines.\n\nThe isocline for patch $1$, denoted $I_1$, is found by setting $\\frac{dN_1}{dt} = 0$. From equation (1), we solve for $N_2^{\\ast}$ as a function of $N_1^{\\ast}$ (we drop the asterisks for simplicity):\n$$ m(N_2 - N_1) = -r_1 N_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{N_1}{K_1}\\right) $$\n$$ N_2 = N_1 - \\frac{r_1}{m} N_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{N_1}{K_1}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the given parameter values: $r_1=0.2$, $K_1=500$, $m=0.05$.\n$$ N_2 = N_1 - \\frac{0.2}{0.05} N_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{N_1}{500}\\right) = N_1 - 4N_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{N_1}{500}\\right) $$\n$$ I_1: \\quad N_2 = -3N_1 + \\frac{4}{500}N_1^2 = -3N_1 + 0.008N_1^2 $$\nThis is the equation for the first isocline. For $N_2$ to be positive, we require $-3N_1 + 0.008N_1^2  0$. Since we are seeking non-trivial solutions ($N_1  0$), we can divide by $N_1$: $-3 + 0.008N_1  0$, which implies $0.008N_1  3$, or $N_1  \\frac{3}{0.008} = 375$. So, for the isocline $I_1$ to be in the first quadrant (where $N_1  0, N_2  0$), we must have $N_1  375$.\n\nThe isocline for patch $2$, denoted $I_2$, is found by setting $\\frac{dN_2}{dt} = 0$.

For $N_1$ to be positive, we require $3N_2 - 0.01N_2^2  0$. Since we are seeking non-trivial solutions ($N_2  0$), we can divide by $N_2$: $3 - 0.01N_2  0$, which implies $0.01N_2  3$, or $N_2  300$.\nThe maximum value of $N_1$ on this isocline occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which is at $N_2 = \\frac{-3}{2(-0.01)} = 150$. At this point, $N_1 = 3(150) - 0.01(150)^2 = 450 - 225 = 225$. Thus, for the isocline $I_2$ to be in the first quadrant, we must have $0  N_2  300$, and the maximum value $N_1$ can attain is $225$.\n\nA non-trivial equilibrium must be an intersection of $I_1$ and $I_2$ in the first quadrant.\n-   For a point to be on $I_1$ in the first quadrant, it must satisfy $N_1  375$.\n-   For a point to be on $I_2$ in the first quadrant, it must satisfy $0  N_1 \\le 225$.\n\nThe condition for $I_1$ ($N_1  375$) and the condition for $I_2$ ($N_1 \\le 225$) are mutually exclusive.
