It presents a standard model in conservation genetics and requests the derivation of a key theoretical result from first principles. The problem is valid and permits a rigorous solution.\n\nThe task is to first derive the expression for the expected mean relative fitness of the first filial generation, $W_{\\mathrm{F1}}(s,d)$, and then to determine the threshold fitness deficit, $s_{\\star}(d)$, for which assisted gene flow is beneficial after one generation.\n\nLet $W_{\\mathrm{donor}}$ be the mean relative fitness of the donor population and $W_{\\mathrm{recipient}}$ be the mean relative fitness of the recipient population, both measured in the recipient's environment. According to the problem statement, we have:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{donor}} = 1$$\n$$W_{\\mathrm{recipient}} = 1 - s$$\nwhere $s \\in (0,1)$ is the fitness deficit of the recipient population.\n\nThe offspring of the first filial generation ($F1$) are formed by crossing one donor parent with one recipient parent. It is stated that each parent contributes equally to the offspring's genome. In the absence of dominance and epistasis (including outbreeding depression), the expected mean fitness of the F1 generation, which we shall denote as the baseline fitness $W'_{\\mathrm{F1}}$, is the arithmetic mean of the parental fitness values.\n$$W'_{\\mathrm{F1}} = \\frac{1}{2} W_{\\mathrm{donor}} + \\frac{1}{2} W_{\\mathrm{recipient}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$W'_{\\mathrm{F1}} = \\frac{1}{2}(1) + \\frac{1}{2}(1-s) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{s}{2} = 1 - \\frac{s}{2}$$\nThis expression represents the expected fitness gain from masking the deleterious recessive alleles responsible for the inbreeding load component of $s$, a phenomenon known as heterosis or hybrid vigor.\n\nNext, we must account for outbreeding depression. The problem defines this as a proportional reduction in the F1 mean relative fitness by a factor $d \\in [0,1)$. A proportional reduction of a quantity $Q$ by a factor $d$ implies the new quantity is $Q' = Q \\times (1-d)$. Applying this to the baseline F1 fitness $W'_{\\mathrm{F1}}$:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{F1}}(s,d) = W'_{\\mathrm{F1}} \\times (1-d)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $W'_{\\mathrm{F1}}$:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{F1}}(s,d) = \\left(1 - \\frac{s}{2}\\right)(1 - d)$$\nThis is the required expression for the expected F1 mean relative fitness.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the threshold $s_{\\star}(d)$ such that genetic rescue is beneficial. This is explicitly defined as the condition where the F1 fitness, $W_{\\mathrm{F1}}(s,d)$, exceeds the pre-intervention fitness of the recipient population, $W_{\\mathrm{recipient}} = 1 - s$. The inequality is:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{F1}}(s,d) > W_{\\mathrm{recipient}}$$\n$$\\left(1 - \\frac{s}{2}\\right)(1 - d) > 1 - s$$\nWe must now solve this inequality for $s$ to find the condition under which rescue occurs.

The problem states this is certain, so $P(C_i^- | U_i) = 1$.\n    Thus, $P(D_i | U_i) = S_p$.\n\nNow, we can assemble the expression for $p_{\\text{post}}$:\n$$p_{\\text{post}} = P(I_i | D_i) = \\frac{P(I_i) P(D_i | I_i)}{P(I_i) P(D_i | I_i) + P(U_i) P(D_i | U_i)}$$\nSubstituting the priors and conditional probabilities:\n$$p_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{\\pi (1 - S_e) \\exp(-\\lambda q)}{\\pi (1 - S_e) \\exp(-\\lambda q) + (1 - \\pi) S_p}$$\nThis is the posterior probability that one specific individual is infected, given that individual tested negative and showed no clinical signs.\n\nThe question asks for the posterior probability that the cohort contains zero infected individuals, given the data for the whole cohort. Let this event be $E_0$. This is equivalent to all $N$ individuals being uninfected, posterior to the observations. Since individuals are independent a priori and the observations on them are conducted independently, their posterior statuses are also independent.\nTherefore, the probability that the cohort is free of infection is the product of the probabilities that each individual is uninfected, given their respective data:\n$$P(E_0 | \\text{all data}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} P(U_i | D_i)$$\nThe posterior probability that a single individual is uninfected is $P(U_i | D_i) = 1 - P(I_i | D_i) = 1 - p_{\\text{post}}$.\nSo, the desired probability, which we will denote $P_{\\text{free}}$, is:\n$$P_{\\text{free}} = (1 - p_{\\text{post}})^N = \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\pi (1 - S_e) \\exp(-\\lambda q)}{\\pi (1 - S_e) \\exp(-\\lambda q) + (1 - \\pi) S_p} \\right)^N$$\nBy finding a common denominator for the term in the parenthesis, we get the analytical expression:\n$$P_{\\text{free}} = \\left( \\frac{(1 - \\pi) S_p}{\\pi (1 - S_e) \\exp(-\\lambda q) + (1 - \\pi) S_p} \\right)^N$$\nThis is the final analytic expression for the posterior probability that the cohort is free of infection.\n\nNow, we must evaluate this expression for the given parameter values:\n- $N = 20$\n- $\\pi = 0.05$\n- $S_e = 0.90$\n- $S_p = 0.98$\n- $\\lambda = 0.2 \\text{ day}^{-1}$\n- $q = 14 \\text{ days}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the terms in the expression.\nThe exponential term is $\\exp(-\\lambda q) = \\exp(-0.2 \\times 14) = \\exp(-2.8)$.\nThe term for an infected individual contributing to the probability of the data is $\\pi (1 - S_e) \\exp(-\\lambda q) = 0.05 \\times (1 - 0.90) \\times \\exp(-2.8) = 0.05 \\times 0.1 \\times \\exp(-2.8) = 0.005 \\exp(-2.8)$.\nThe term for an uninfected individual is $(1 - \\pi) S_p = (1 - 0.05) \\times 0.98 = 0.95 \\times 0.98 = 0.931$.\n\nLet's compute the value of $p_{\\text{post}}$:\n$$p_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{0.005 \\exp(-2.8)}{0.005 \\exp(-2.8) + 0.931}$$\nUsing $\\exp(-2.8) \\approx 0.06081006$:\n$$p_{\\text{post}} \\approx \\frac{0.005 \\times 0.06081006}{0.005 \\times 0.06081006 + 0.931} = \\frac{0.00030405}{0.00030405 + 0.931} = \\frac{0.00030405}{0.93130405} \\approx 0.00032648$$\nThe posterior probability that a single individual is uninfected is $1 - p_{\\text{post}} \\approx 1 - 0.00032648 = 0.99967352$.\nFinally, the posterior probability that the entire cohort of $N=20$ individuals is uninfected is:\n$$P_{\\text{free}} = (1 - p_{\\text{post}})^N \\approx (0.99967352)^{20}$$\n$$P_{\\text{free}} \\approx 0.993491295$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.9935$.\nThis result signifies that after $14$ days of quarantine with no clinical signs and initial negative PCR tests across the whole cohort, there is a $99.35\\%$ probability that the group is entirely free of the pathogen, despite the initial $5\\%$ background prevalence and imperfect diagnostic tests.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9935}$$", "id": "2471832"}]}
