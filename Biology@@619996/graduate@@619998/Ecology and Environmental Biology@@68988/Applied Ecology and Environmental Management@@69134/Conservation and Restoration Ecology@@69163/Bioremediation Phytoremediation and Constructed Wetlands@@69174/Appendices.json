Assume the tracer used is conservative (no reaction, no sorption), the fluid is incompressible with constant density, and boundary effects other than advection and mixing are negligible.\n\nAt time $t = 0$, a pulse of a conservative tracer of negligible volume is injected at the inlet. The outlet concentration time series $C_{\\text{out}}(t)$ is recorded and used to define the Residence Time Distribution (RTD), $E(t)$, by the normalization $E(t) = C_{\\text{out}}(t)\\big/\\int_{0}^{\\infty} C_{\\text{out}}(t)\\,dt$. The measured $E(t)$ is well-described by a two-path model with an early short-circuiting branch and a delayed mixed branch:\n$$\nE(t) \\;=\\; p\\,\\delta\\!\\big(t - t_{s}\\big) \\;+\\; \\big(1-p\\big)\\,\\frac{1}{t_{m}}\\,\\exp\\!\\Big(-\\frac{t - t_{0}}{t_{m}}\\Big)\\,H\\!\\big(t - t_{0}\\big),\n$$\nwhere $\\delta(\\cdot)$ is the Dirac delta function, $H(\\cdot)$ is the Heaviside unit step, $p = 0.30$ is the measured early mass fraction, $t_{s} = 300$ s is the early-arrival time, $t_{0} = 1600$ s is the onset time of the mixed branch, and $t_{m} = 2300$ s is the characteristic time of the mixed branch.\n\nStarting from conservation of mass for steady, incompressible flow through a porous control volume, and from the definitions of pore volume and RTD moments only (do not invoke any unproven shortcut formulas), derive the nominal hydraulic residence time in terms of structural porosity and discharge, and show how porosity reduction and hydraulically inactive regions (“dead zones”) alter the effective residence time inferred from $E(t)$. Using those derivations and the given $E(t)$, compute the apparent short-circuiting fraction\n$$\ns \\;=\\; 1 \\;-\\; \\frac{\\bar{t}}{\\tau_{\\text{nom}}},\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{t}$ is the mean of $E(t)$ and $\\tau_{\\text{nom}}$ is the nominal residence time based on the structural pore volume. Express your final answer for $s$ as a dimensionless decimal rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The primary task is to compute the apparent short-circuiting fraction $s = 1 - \\bar{t}/\\tau_{\\text{nom}}$. This requires the derivation and calculation of two quantities: the nominal residence time, $\\tau_{\\text{nom}}$, and the mean residence time, $\\bar{t}$, from the given Residence Time Distribution (RTD), $E(t)$.\n\nFirst, we derive the nominal hydraulic residence time, $\\tau_{\\text{nom}}$, from first principles as requested. We consider a control volume defined by the physical boundaries of the saturated porous bed. The total bulk volume of this bed is $V = LWH$, where $L$ is the length, $W$ is the width, and $H$ is the saturated thickness. The volume of the voids within the porous medium, which is the volume occupied by water, is the pore volume, $V_p$. It is defined by the structural porosity, $\\phi_s$, as the fraction of the bulk volume that is void space:\n$$\nV_p = \\phi_s V = \\phi_s L W H\n$$\nFor a steady and incompressible flow, the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, through the control volume is constant. The nominal residence time, $\\tau_{\\text{nom}}$, is defined as the time it would take for a volume of fluid equal to the total pore volume to pass through the system. This represents an ideal condition where the entire pore volume is hydraulically active and uniformly utilized for flow.\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{nom}} = \\frac{V_p}{Q} = \\frac{\\phi_s L W H}{Q}\n$$\nThe mean residence time, $\\bar{t}$, is the average time a tracer element actually spends within the system, as determined from an experimental tracer study. It is the first moment of the Residence Time Distribution, $E(t)$:\n$$\n\\bar{t} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t E(t) \\,dt\n$$\nIn a real system, factors such as preferential flow paths (short-circuiting) and hydraulically inactive regions (dead zones) cause the effective fluid-carrying volume to be less than the total pore volume, $V_p$. This leads to a measured mean residence time, $\\bar{t}$, that is less than the ideal nominal time, $\\tau_{\\text{nom}}$. The short-circuiting fraction, $s$, quantifies this discrepancy, representing the fraction of the system volume that is effectively bypassed by the flow.\n\nWe now proceed with the calculations. The nominal residence time $\\tau_{\\text{nom}}$ is calculated using the given parameters: $L = 60$ m, $W = 12$ m, $H = 0.50$ m, $\\phi_s = 0.40$, and $Q = 0.025$ m$^3$ s$^{-1}$.\nThe pore volume is:\n$$\nV_p = (0.40) \\cdot (60\\,\\text{m}) \\cdot (12\\,\\text{m}) \\cdot (0.50\\,\\text{m}) = 144\\,\\text{m}^3\n$$\nThe nominal residence time is therefore:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{nom}} = \\frac{144\\,\\text{m}^3}{0.025\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} = 5760\\,\\text{s}\n$$\nNext, we compute the mean residence time $\\bar{t}$ from the given RTD model:\n$$\nE(t) = p\\,\\delta(t - t_s) + (1-p)\\,\\frac{1}{t_m}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t - t_0}{t_m}\\right)\\,H(t - t_0)\n$$\nBy definition, $\\bar{t}$ is the first moment of $E(t)$:\n$$\n\\bar{t} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t \\left[ p\\,\\delta(t - t_s) + (1-p)\\,\\frac{1}{t_m}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t - t_0}{t_m}\\right)\\,H(t - t_0) \\right] dt\n$$\nThe integral is linear and can be split. The mean is a weighted average of the means of the two components of the distribution:\n$$\n\\bar{t} = p \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t\\,\\delta(t - t_s) \\,dt + (1-p) \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{t}{t_m}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t - t_0}{t_m}\\right)\\,H(t - t_0) \\,dt\n$$\nThe first integral, involving the Dirac delta function $\\delta(\\cdot)$, evaluates to $t_s$ by the sifting property. The second integral's lower limit becomes $t_0$ due to the Heaviside step function $H(\\cdot)$. Let $\\bar{t}_{\\text{mix}}$ be the mean of the mixed branch:\n$$\n\\bar{t}_{\\text{mix}} = \\int_{t_0}^{\\infty} \\frac{t}{t_m}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t-t_0}{t_m}\\right) \\,dt\n$$\nUsing the substitution $u = t - t_0$, which implies $t = u + t_0$ and $dt = du$, the integral becomes:\n$$\n\\bar{t}_{\\text{mix}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{u+t_0}{t_m}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{u}{t_m}\\right) \\,du = \\frac{1}{t_m} \\left[ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} u\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{u}{t_m}\\right) \\,du + t_0 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u}{t_m}\\right) \\,du \\right]\n$$\nThese are standard definite integrals related to the Gamma function. The first integral evaluates to $t_m^2$ and the second to $t_m$.\n$$\n\\bar{t}_{\\text{mix}} = \\frac{1}{t_m} \\left[ t_m^2 + t_0 t_m \\right] = t_m + t_0\n$$\nThus, the total mean residence time is:\n$$\n\\bar{t} = p\\,t_s + (1-p)(t_m + t_0)\n$$\nSubstituting the given values: $p = 0.30$, $t_s = 300$ s, $t_0 = 1600$ s, and $t_m = 2300$ s:\n$$\n\\bar{t} = (0.30)(300\\,\\text{s}) + (1-0.30)(2300\\,\\text{s} + 1600\\,\\text{s})\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{t} = 90\\,\\text{s} + (0.70)(3900\\,\\text{s}) = 90\\,\\text{s} + 2730\\,\\text{s} = 2820\\,\\text{s}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the apparent short-circuiting fraction, $s$:\n$$\ns = 1 - \\frac{\\bar{t}}{\\tau_{\\text{nom}}} = 1 - \\frac{2820\\,\\text{s}}{5760\\,\\text{s}} = 1 - \\frac{282}{576} = 1 - \\frac{47}{96}\n$$\nThe numerical value is:\n$$\ns \\approx 1 - 0.4895833... = 0.5104166...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required by the problem statement yields:\n$$\ns \\approx 0.5104\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5104}\n$$", "id": "2474134"}]}
