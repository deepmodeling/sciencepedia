Treat the population as hermaphroditic with nonoverlapping generations and assume random mating. To connect this observation to a mechanistic reproductive model, work at the level of successful gametes: each recruited juvenile requires two parental gametes, so the parents that produce about $100$ recruited juveniles each contribute approximately $200$ successful gametes, and the others contribute $0$. Let $k$ denote the number of successful gametes contributed by a parent to the zygote pool in one generation.\n\nStarting from the definition of effective population size based on the rate of random genetic drift—specifically, that in an ideal Wright–Fisher diploid population the one-generation variance in allele frequency is $\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta p) = p(1-p)/(2N_{\\mathrm{ideal}})$—and using only the moments of the empirical distribution of $k$, derive the expression for the effective population size $N_{e}$ of this skewed-reproduction population in terms of $N$ and the variance of $k$, and then compute the numerical value of the ratio $N_{e}/N$ for the scenario above.\n\nRound your final ratio to four significant figures and express it as a unitless decimal number.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the effective population size, $N_e$, for a population with variance in reproductive success and its subsequent calculation for a specific scenario. The derivation must start from the fundamental definition of $N_e$ related to genetic drift. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard problem in population genetics. All necessary parameters are provided. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe effective population size, $N_e$, can be defined based on the rate of increase of inbreeding (the inbreeding effective size) or the variance in allele frequency change (the variance effective size). For an ideal population, these definitions are equivalent. The problem provides the variance definition: in an ideal Wright–Fisher diploid population of size $N_{\\mathrm{ideal}}$, the one-generation variance in the frequency of a neutral allele, $p$, is given by:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta p) = \\frac{p(1-p)}{2N_{\\mathrm{ideal}}} $$\nWe can define the effective size $N_e$ of any population by equating its variance in allele frequency change to this ideal value:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta p)_{\\text{actual}} = \\frac{p(1-p)}{2N_e} $$\nTo find $N_e$, we must derive an expression for $\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta p)$ in a population with variable gamete contribution. A robust way to do this is to consider the increase in identity by descent (IBD), which is directly linked to the variance of allele frequencies.\n\nLet $F_t$ be the average probability of IBD for two homologous alleles drawn randomly from the population at generation $t$. The effective size $N_e$ is defined by the recurrence relation for inbreeding in an ideal population:\n$$ F_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{2N_e} + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right)F_t $$\nThis can be rewritten as the one-generation change in inbreeding, $\\Delta F = F_{t+1}-F_t$:\n$$ \\Delta F = \\frac{1 - F_t}{2N_e} $$\nWe will now derive the corresponding change in inbreeding for our non-ideal population and equate the results to find $N_e$.\n\nThe population consists of $N$ hermaphroditic diploid individuals. To form the next generation, a total of $2N$ successful gametes are produced (since the population size is constant at $N$). Let $k_i$ be the number of successful gametes contributed by parent $i$, for $i = 1, \\dots, N$. The total number of successful gametes is $\\sum_{i=1}^N k_i = N\\bar{k}$. For a stable population size, the average gamete contribution per parent must be $\\bar{k}=2$. So, $\\sum_{i=1}^N k_i = 2N$.\n\n$F_{t+1}$ is the probability that two alleles drawn randomly from the successful gamete pool of generation $t$ are identical by descent. Let's sample two gametes *without replacement* from the pool of $2N$ gametes.\nThe probability that these two gametes come from the same parent is the sum over all parents of the probability of picking two gametes from that parent. Let this probability be $P_1$.\n$$ P_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( \\frac{k_i}{2N} \\cdot \\frac{k_i-1}{2N-1} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2N(2N-1)} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} k_i(k_i - 1) $$\nThe sum can be expressed using the moments of the distribution of $k$. The variance of $k$ is $\\sigma_k^2 = E(k^2) - (E(k))^2 = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum k_i^2 - \\bar{k}^2$.\nFrom this, we have $\\sum k_i^2 = N(\\sigma_k^2 + \\bar{k}^2)$.\nThe sum in the expression for $P_1$ is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (k_i^2 - k_i) = \\sum k_i^2 - \\sum k_i = N(\\sigma_k^2 + \\bar{k}^2) - N\\bar{k} $$\nSubstituting $\\bar{k}=2$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (k_i^2 - k_i) = N(\\sigma_k^2 + 2^2) - 2N = N(\\sigma_k^2 + 4) - 2N = N(\\sigma_k^2 + 2) $$\nNow, substitute this back into the expression for $P_1$:\n$$ P_1 = \\frac{N(\\sigma_k^2 + 2)}{2N(2N-1)} = \\frac{\\sigma_k^2 + 2}{2(2N-1)} $$\nIf the two gametes come from the same parent, the probability they are IBD is $\\frac{1+F_i}{2}$, where $F_i$ is the parent's inbreeding coefficient. Assuming parents are randomly drawn from generation $t$, the average is $\\frac{1+F_t}{2}$. If they come from different parents (with probability $1-P_1$), the probability they are IBD is $F_t$, assuming the parents are unrelated.\nThus, the IBD probability in the next generation is:\n$$ F_{t+1} = P_1 \\left( \\frac{1+F_t}{2} \\right) + (1-P_1)F_t = \\frac{P_1}{2} + \\frac{P_1 F_t}{2} + F_t - P_1 F_t = \\frac{P_1}{2} + \\left( 1 - \\frac{P_1}{2} \\right)F_t $$\nThe one-generation change in inbreeding is:\n$$ \\Delta F = F_{t+1} - F_t = \\frac{P_1}{2}(1 - F_t) $$\nComparing this to the ideal population formula $\\Delta F = \\frac{1}{2N_e}(1-F_t)$, we find:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2N_e} = \\frac{P_1}{2} \\implies N_e = \\frac{1}{P_1} $$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $P_1$:\n$$ N_e = \\frac{2(2N-1)}{\\sigma_k^2 + 2} = \\frac{4N-2}{\\sigma_k^2 + 2} $$\nThis expression for $N_e$ is derived from first principles and depends only on the census size $N$ and the variance of gamete contribution $\\sigma_k^2$, as required.\n\nNow, we apply this formula to the given scenario.\nThe population has $N=10000$ individuals.
