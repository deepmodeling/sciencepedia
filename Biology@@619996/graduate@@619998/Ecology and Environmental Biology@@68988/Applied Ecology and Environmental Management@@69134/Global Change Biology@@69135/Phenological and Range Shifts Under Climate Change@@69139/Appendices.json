To solve this, we must first formalize the population's demographic projection model based on the provided life cycle characteristics.\n\nThe insect life cycle is described as univoltine (one generation per year) and semelparous (reproducing once before death). The population is structured into two stages: juveniles and adults. The census is conducted annually at the juvenile stage. The transition from juveniles to adults, reproduction, and adult death all occur within a single annual time step. This description implies a pre-breeding census model where the adult stage is not present from one year to the next.\n\nLet the state of the population at the time of census in year $t$ be represented by a vector $\\mathbf{n}_t = \\begin{pmatrix} J_t \\\\ A_t \\end{pmatrix}$, where $J_t$ is the number of juveniles and $A_t$ is the number of adults. Because of semelparity and the census timing, no adults from the previous year survive to the census point, so $A_t=0$ for all years $t$. The dynamics are therefore completely determined by the number of juveniles.\n\nThe projection from the census at time $t$ to the census at time $t+1$ occurs as follows:\n1.  Juveniles present at time $t$, $J_t$, survive to become adults within the year with probability $s_J$. The number of adults that will reproduce is $s_J J_t$.\n2.  Each of these adults produces $F(m)$ juvenile daughters, where $m$ is the phenological mismatch. The total number of new juveniles that will constitute the population at the next census at time $t+1$ is $J_{t+1} = (s_J J_t) \\times F(m)$.\n3.  The reproducing adults die, so the adult population at census $t+1$ is again zero, $A_{t+1}=0$.\n\nThe dynamics of the juvenile population are thus governed by the scalar equation $J_{t+1} = (F(m) s_J) J_t$. The annual population growth rate, $\\lambda$, is the multiplicative factor in this equation, so $\\lambda = F(m) s_J$.\n\nTo be fully rigorous and adhere to the \"two-stage projection matrix\" language, we can construct the matrix $\\mathbf{L}$ such that $\\mathbf{n}_{t+1} = \\mathbf{L} \\mathbf{n}_t$.

The projection matrix is $\\mathbf{L} = \\begin{pmatrix} F(m)s_J & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nAccording to demographic theory, the long-term annual growth rate of the population is the dominant eigenvalue of the projection matrix $\\mathbf{L}$. For this diagonal matrix, the eigenvalues are its diagonal elements: $\\lambda_1 = F(m)s_J$ and $\\lambda_2 = 0$. The dominant eigenvalue is thus $\\lambda = F(m)s_J$, which confirms our simpler derivation.\n\nNow, we can proceed to the calculation.\n\nFirst, we determine the baseline growth rate, $\\lambda_{base}$, under the initial conditions ($m=0$).
