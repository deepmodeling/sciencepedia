Given the constraint $0 < A < K$, we have three distinct, ordered equilibria.\n\nTo determine their stability, we examine the sign of $f(N)$ in the intervals between these equilibria. It is useful to rewrite $f(N)$ as:\n$$\nf(N) = - \\frac{r}{AK} N (N-A) (N-K)\n$$\nThe pre-factor $-\\frac{r}{AK}$ is negative since $r, A, K$ are all positive.\n\n1.  For $N \\in (0, A)$: $N>0$, $N-A<0$, and $N-K<0$. The product $N(N-A)(N-K)$ is positive. Thus, $f(N) < 0$, and the population declines towards $N=0$.\n2.  For $N \\in (A, K)$: $N>0$, $N-A>0$, and $N-K<0$. The product $N(N-A)(N-K)$ is negative. Thus, $f(N)>0$, and the population grows.\n3.  For $N \\in (K, \\infty)$: $N>0$, $N-A>0$, and $N-K>0$. The product $N(N-A)(N-K)$ is positive.

This basin is the interval $(A, \\infty)$. Any initial population $N_0 > A$ will grow and converge to $K$. If $N_0 \\le A$, the population will decline to $0$ (or remain at $A$ if $N_0 = A$, a point of unstable equilibrium).

Construct Niche Distributions**\n\nThe corrected, unnormalized niche suitability, $u_i$, for each bin $i$ is calculated as the ratio of occurrences ($o_i$) to environmental availability ($a_i$).\n\nFor the native range (Region N):\n- $u^{N}_{1} = o^{N}_{1} / a^{N}_{1} = 56 / 0.4 = 140$\n- $u^{N}_{2} = o^{N}_{2} / a^{N}_{2} = 15 / 0.3 = 50$\n- $u^{N}_{3} = o^{N}_{3} / a^{N}_{3} = 2 / 0.2 = 10$\n- $u^{N}_{4} = o^{N}_{4} / a^{N}_{4} = 0 / 0.1 = 0$\n\nThe total unnormalized score for Region N is $S^N = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} u^{N}_{i} = 140 + 50 + 10 + 0 = 200$.\nThe normalized niche distribution for Region N, $p^N$, is:\n- $p^{N}_{1} = u^{N}_{1} / S^N = 140 / 200 = 0.70$\n- $p^{N}_{2} = u^{N}_{2} / S^N = 50 / 200 = 0.25$\n- $p^{N}_{3} = u^{N}_{3} / S^N = 10 / 200 = 0.05$\n- $p^{N}_{4} = u^{N}_{4} / S^N = 0 / 200 = 0.00$\nSo, the niche probability vector for Region N is $p^N = (0.70, 0.25, 0.05, 0.00)$.\n\nFor the introduced range (Region I):\n- $u^{I}_{1} = o^{I}_{1} / a^{I}_{1} = 1 / 0.1 = 10$\n- $u^{I}_{2} = o^{I}_{2} / a^{I}_{2} = 4 / 0.2 = 20$\n- $u^{I}_{3} = o^{I}_{3} / a^{I}_{3} = 21 / 0.3 = 70$\n- $u^{I}_{4} = o^{I}_{4} / a^{I}_{4} = 40 / 0.4 = 100$\n\nThe total unnormalized score for Region I is $S^I = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} u^{I}_{i} = 10 + 20 + 70 + 100 = 200$.\nThe normalized niche distribution for Region I, $p^I$, is:\n- $p^{I}_{1} = u^{I}_{1} / S^I = 10 / 200 = 0.05$\n- $p^{I}_{2} = u^{I}_{2} / S^I = 20 / 200 = 0.10$\n- $p^{I}_{3} = u^{I}_{3} / S^I = 70 / 200 = 0.35$\n- $p^{I}_{4} = u^{I}_{4} / S^I = 100 / 200 = 0.50$\nSo, the niche probability vector for Region I is $p^I = (0.05, 0.10, 0.35, 0.50)$.\n\n**2.

This is a low value, as $D$ ranges from $0$ (no overlap) to $1$ (identical distributions). The task is to identify valid explanations for a successful invasion given this low overlap in the occupied climatic niches.\n\n**3. Evaluate Options**\n\n**Option A**: A low value of $D$ rules out successful invasion, because a species’ fundamental niche is identical across ranges and low overlap necessarily indicates failure to persist.\nThis statement is flawed. The problem explicitly states the species has been \"introduced and established\", meaning invasion has been successful. The statement's conclusion contradicts this premise. Furthermore, correlative models estimate the *realized niche*, which is a subset of the *fundamental niche*. A low overlap of realized niches does not mean the fundamental niches are different or that the species cannot persist. The realized niche is shaped by both abiotic conditions (availability) and biotic interactions, which can differ between ranges.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option B**: A low value of $D$ can arise if the introduced region presents non-analog environmental combinations that were not available in the native range but still fall within the species’ fundamental niche; correlative models trained only on the native range will tend to underpredict introduced occurrences unless transfer is evaluated (for example, with a Multivariate Environmental Similarity Surface (MESS) analysis).\nThis describes a classic scenario in invasion ecology. The native range is dominated by environments of Bin $1$ ($a^N_1 = 0.4$), where the species is abundant. The introduced range is dominated by environments of Bin $4$ ($a^I_4 = 0.4$), which are rare in the native range ($a^N_4 = 0.1$) and where the species is not observed there ($o^N_4 = 0$). The species thrives in Bin $4$ in the introduced range ($o^I_4 = 40$). This suggests that the conditions in Bin $4$ are part of the species' fundamental niche but this part of the niche was not realized in the native range due to the rarity of those environments (\"niche unfilling\"). This leads to a low overlap ($D=0.2$) when the species successfully colonizes these \"non-analog\" or novel environments.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Option C**: A low value of $D$ necessarily indicates model misspecification; with proper choice of background and sufficient complexity, $D$ should be high for any successful invader.\nThis statement makes a universal claim that is false. A low $D$ is not necessarily a sign of a flawed model; it can represent a real biological phenomenon, as described in option B. The assumption that $D$ *should* be high for any successful invader is the hypothesis of \"niche conservatism,\" which is often tested but frequently violated. Successful invasions are often characterized by niche shifts or expansions, leading to low $D$ values.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D**: A low value of $D$ alongside establishment is consistent with a niche shift in the introduced range driven by phenotypic plasticity or rapid evolution, implying that complementary tests with mechanistic models or trait data are warranted.\nThis presents a valid alternative or complementary hypothesis to option B. Instead of the fundamental niche being static, it could have changed upon introduction. Phenotypic plasticity could allow individuals to thrive in the novel conditions of Region I, or rapid evolution could have selected for genotypes better adapted to those conditions. Either mechanism would constitute a shift in the species' fundamental niche, explaining its success in environments where it was absent in its native range. This would result in low realized niche overlap ($D=0.2$). The call for further tests is standard scientific protocol to distinguish this hypothesis from others.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Option E**: A low value of $D$ can be explained by release from natural enemies or competitors in the introduced range that alters the realized niche without requiring a change in the fundamental niche, allowing invasion despite low overlap in correlative niches.\nThis invokes the \"enemy release hypothesis,\" another cornerstone of invasion biology. In the native range, biotic pressures may prevent the species from occupying otherwise suitable habitats (e.g., the environments in Bins $3$ and $4$). If these enemies are absent in the introduced range, the species can expand its realized niche to include these environments, even if the fundamental niche (physiological tolerances) has not changed. This change in the occupied portion of the predictor space (climate) leads to a low $D$. Thus, a change in biotic context can manifest as a shift in the realized climatic niche.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nIn summary, the calculated low value of $D=0.20$ for an established invader is consistent with multiple established ecological theories. Options B, D, and E represent the three primary, non-mutually exclusive explanations for this common pattern in invasion biology: niche unfilling due to novel environments (B), shifts in the fundamental niche (D), and shifts in the realized niche due to altered biotic interactions (E).

It is well-posed and objective. A critical condition to verify is that the tree is ultrametric, meaning all tips must be equidistant from the root. Let us compute these distances:\nDistance from root $R$ to tip $A$: $d(R,A) = l(R,X) + l(X,Y) + l(Y,A) = 8 + 3 + 2 = 13 \\ \\mathrm{Myr}$.\nDistance from root $R$ to tip $B$: $d(R,B) = l(R,X) + l(X,Y) + l(Y,B) = 8 + 3 + 2 = 13 \\ \\mathrm{Myr}$.\nDistance from root $R$ to tip $C$: $d(R,C) = l(R,X) + l(X,C) = 8 + 5 = 13 \\ \\mathrm{Myr}$.\nDistance from root $R$ to tip $D$: $d(R,D) = l(R,D) = 13 \\ \\mathrm{Myr}$.\nAll tips are equidistant from the root at a distance of $13 \\ \\mathrm{Myr}$. The problem statement is consistent with the ultrametric condition. The problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe topology of the phylogenetic tree is as follows: The root $R$ has two descendants, the tip $D$ and the internal node $X$. The node $X$ has two descendants, the tip $C$ and the internal node $Y$. The node $Y$ has two descendants, the tips $A$ and $B$.\n\nStep 1: Compute the Faith’s phylogenetic diversity (PD) of the resident community $\\{A, C, D\\}$.\nThe minimal subtree connecting the tips $\\{A, C, D\\}$ includes the paths from each tip to their most recent common ancestor until a single connected graph is formed. This requires traversing from $A$ to $Y$, $C$ to $X$, and then connecting $Y$ and $X$ to the root $R$, which also connects $D$. The set of branches in this minimal subtree is $\\{(Y,A), (X,Y), (X,C), (R,X), (R,D)\\}$.\nThe PD is the sum of the lengths of these branches:\n$$ \\mathrm{PD}(\\{A, C, D\\}) = l(Y,A) + l(X,Y) + l(X,C) + l(R,X) + l(R,D) $$\n$$ \\mathrm{PD}(\\{A, C, D\\}) = 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 = 31 \\ \\mathrm{Myr} $$\n\nStep 2: Compute the new PD after adding invader $B$ and the marginal PD gain $\\Delta \\mathrm{PD}$.\nThe new community is $\\{A, B, C, D\\}$. The minimal subtree connecting these tips encompasses all branches of the full tree. The set of branches is $\\{(Y,A), (Y,B), (X,Y), (X,C), (R,X), (R,D)\\}$.\nThe new PD is the sum of all branch lengths:\n$$ \\mathrm{PD}(\\{A, B, C, D\\}) = l(Y,A) + l(Y,B) + l(X,Y) + l(X,C) + l(R,X) + l(R,D) $$\n$$ \\mathrm{PD}(\\{A, B, C, D\\}) = 2 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 = 33 \\ \\mathrm{Myr} $$\nThe marginal PD gain, $\\Delta \\mathrm{PD}$, is the difference between the new and original PD values.\n$$ \\Delta \\mathrm{PD} = \\mathrm{PD}(\\{A, B, C, D\\}) - \\mathrm{PD}(\\{A, C, D\\}) = 33 - 31 = 2 \\ \\mathrm{Myr} $$\nThis gain corresponds to the length of the branch $(Y,B)$ that is added to the original minimal subtree to connect tip $B$.\n\nStep 3: Compute the invader’s mean patristic distance $\\bar{d}$ and the overlap $O$.\nThe patristic distance is the sum of branch lengths along the path between two tips. We calculate the distance from the invader $B$ to each resident species in $\\{A, C, D\\}$.\n- The path between $B$ and $A$ is $B \\to Y \\to A$.\n  $$ d(B,A) = l(Y,B) + l(Y,A) = 2 + 2 = 4 \\ \\mathrm{Myr} $$\n- The path between $B$ and $C$ is $B \\to Y \\to X \\to C$.\n  $$ d(B,C) = l(Y,B) + l(X,Y) + l(X,C) = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 \\ \\mathrm{Myr} $$\n- The path between $B$ and $D$ is $B \\to Y \\to X \\to R \\to D$.\n  $$ d(B,D) = l(Y,B) + l(X,Y) + l(R,X) + l(R,D) = 2 + 3 + 8 + 13 = 26 \\ \\mathrm{Myr} $$\nThe mean patristic distance $\\bar{d}$ is the arithmetic mean of these values:\n$$ \\bar{d} = \\frac{d(B,A) + d(B,C) + d(B,D)}{3} = \\frac{4 + 10 + 26}{3} = \\frac{40}{3} \\ \\mathrm{Myr} $$\nThe niche overlap $O$ is calculated using the exponential decay model with $\\beta = 0.1 \\ \\mathrm{Myr}^{-1}$.\n$$ O = \\exp(-\\beta \\bar{d}) = \\exp\\left(-0.1 \\times \\frac{40}{3}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{40}{3}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4}{3}\\right) $$\n\nStep 4: Compute the diagnostic quantity $P = \\Delta \\mathrm{PD} \\times O$.\nUsing the values derived in the previous steps:\n$$ P = \\Delta \\mathrm{PD} \\times O = 2 \\times \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4}{3}\\right) $$\nTo find the numerical value, we compute the expression:\n$$ P = 2 \\times \\exp(-1.333...) \\approx 2 \\times 0.263597... \\approx 0.527194... \\ \\mathrm{Myr} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, as required by the problem statement, gives $P \\approx 0.5272 \\ \\mathrm{Myr}$.\nThis is the final quantity to be reported.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0.5272} $$", "id": "2541135"}]}
