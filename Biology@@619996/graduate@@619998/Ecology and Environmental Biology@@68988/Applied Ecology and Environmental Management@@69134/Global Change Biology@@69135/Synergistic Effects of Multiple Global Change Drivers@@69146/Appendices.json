Each driver will be applied at $3$ levels, coded as $-1$ (low), $0$ (intermediate), and $+1$ (high), yielding a fully factorial $3 \\times 3$ design with $n$ independent replicate experimental units per treatment combination. Assume the community response variable is measured on a continuous scale with homoscedastic, independent errors.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution. I will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe first task is to specify the degrees of freedom ($df$) associated with the experimental design and statistical models.\nThe experiment is a $3 \\times 3$ factorial design with $n$ replicates per cell. The total number of experimental units is $N = 3 \\times 3 \\times n = 9n$. The total degrees of freedom are $N-1 = 9n-1$.\n\nUnder a cell-means ANOVA formulation, we estimate a separate mean for each of the $9$ treatment combinations.

Thus, curvature for each driver has $1$ degree of freedom.\n- The interaction's $4$ $df$ can be partitioned into four single-degree-of-freedom components: linear-by-linear ($x_L \\times z_L$), linear-by-quadratic ($x_L \\times z_Q$), quadratic-by-linear ($x_Q \\times z_L$), and quadratic-by-quadratic ($x_Q \\times z_Q$).\n\nThe second-order polynomial model given is:\n$$ Y = \\mu + \\beta_{x} x + \\beta_{x^{2}} x^{2} + \\beta_{z} z + \\beta_{z^{2}} z^{2} + \\beta_{xz} x z + \\varepsilon $$\nThis is a regression model with $p=6$ parameters to be estimated (including the intercept $\\mu$).\n- The residual degrees of freedom for this regression model is $df_{error, reg} = N - p = 9n - 6$.\nThis residual sum of squares comprises both the pure error from the ANOVA model and the sum of squares from the model terms not included in the regression (the three higher-order interactions). The degrees of freedom for lack of fit would be $df_{error, reg} - df_{error, ANOVA} = (9n-6) - (9n-9) = 3$.\n\nThe second task is to perform a power analysis to find the minimum integer replication $n$. We wish to test the null hypothesis $H_0: \\beta_{xz} = 0$ against the two-sided alternative $H_A: \\beta_{xz} \\ne 0$, with a target effect size of $|\\beta_{xz}| = 0.5$, at a significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$ and with statistical power of at least $0.80$. The error standard deviation is given as $\\sigma=1$.\n\nThe test is based on the t-statistic for the coefficient $\\hat{\\beta}_{xz}$:\n$$ t = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_{xz}}{SE(\\hat{\\beta}_{xz})} $$\nUnder $H_A$, this statistic follows a non-central t-distribution with $df = 9n-6$ and a noncentrality parameter $\\delta$. To calculate $\\delta$, we first need the variance of the estimator $\\hat{\\beta}_{xz}$. In a general linear model $\\mathbf{Y} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, the variance-covariance matrix of the estimators is $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}) = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\sigma^2$. The variance of a single coefficient $\\hat{\\beta}_j$ is the $j$-th diagonal element of this matrix multiplied by $\\sigma^2$.\n\nThe problem states that orthogonal polynomial coding is used, which ensures that the column in the design matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ corresponding to the $xz$ term is orthogonal to the columns for the other terms in the model ($\\mu, x, x^2, z, z^2$). Let us verify this for the $9$ unique treatment combinations $(x_i, z_j)$ where $x_i, z_j \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$. The regressor column for $xz$ is $\\mathbf{v}_{xz}$ with elements $x_i z_j$. For example, the inner product with the column for $x$ is $\\sum (x_i z_j) x_i = \\sum x_i^2 z_j = ((-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2) \\times (-1) + ((-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2) \\times (0) + ((-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2) \\times (1) = 2(-1) + 2(0) + 2(1) = 0$. The column is indeed orthogonal to all other regressor columns in the model.\n\nDue to this orthogonality, the diagonal element of $(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}$ corresponding to $\\beta_{xz}$ is simply the reciprocal of the sum of squares of the $xz$ column, $(\\sum (xz)^2)^{-1}$. For the $9$ treatment combinations, each replicated $n$ times, the sum of squares for the $xz$ regressor is:\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^{9n} (x_k z_k)^2 = n \\sum_{i \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}} \\sum_{j \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}} (x_i z_j)^2 $$\n$$ \\sum (xz)^2 = n [ (-1)^2(-1)^2 + (-1)^2(0)^2 + (-1)^2(1)^2 + (0)^2(-1)^2 + \\dots + (1)^2(1)^2 ] $$\n$$ \\sum (xz)^2 = n [ (1) + (0) + (1) + (0) + (0) + (0) + (1) + (0) + (1) ] = 4n $$\nThe variance of the estimator $\\hat{\\beta}_{xz}$ is therefore:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{xz}) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sum (xz)^2} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{4n} $$\nWith $\\sigma=1$, we get $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{xz}) = \\frac{1}{4n}$. The true standard error is $SE(\\hat{\\beta}_{xz}) = \\sqrt{1/(4n)} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{n}}$.\n\nThe noncentrality parameter $\\delta$ for the non-central t-distribution is given by:\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{|\\beta_{xz}|}{SE(\\hat{\\beta}_{xz})} = \\frac{|\\beta_{xz}|}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{4n}} = \\frac{0.5 \\times \\sqrt{4n}}{1} = 0.5 \\times 2\\sqrt{n} = \\sqrt{n} $$\nThe condition for achieving power $1-\\beta_{err}$ for a two-sided t-test at significance $\\alpha$ is that the test statistic must exceed the critical value, which requires a sufficiently large noncentrality parameter.

The other tail probability $F_{t(66, \\sqrt{8})}(-1.9966)$ is approximately $3.7 \\times 10^{-6}$.\nThe power for $n=8$ is thus $\\approx 1 - 0.2033 = 0.7967$.

The other tail probability is negligible.\nThe power for $n=9$ is $\\approx 1 - 0.1583 = 0.8417$.

The model, while a simplification of a real ecosystem, does not contain factual or logical inconsistencies. The objective is clear and the methodology is sound. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe task is to identify the optimal management policy from a set of five candidates, evaluated across three distinct environmental test cases. The system under consideration is a single-species population whose biomass, $x_t$, is governed by a discrete-time logistic growth model subjected to pressures from three external drivers. The optimality of a policy is determined by its ability to minimize risk, specifically the Conditional Value at Risk ($\\mathrm{CVaR}_q$) of a discounted shortfall loss function, under conditions of deep uncertainty. This uncertainty is represented by an ensemble of $16$ plausible models, each defined by a unique combination of parameters for intrinsic growth rate ($r$), driver interaction strength ($\\alpha$), and driver sensitivity scaling ($s$).\n\nThe methodical approach to solving this problem involves the following steps for each test case:\n1.  **Ensemble Simulation**: For each of the $5$ candidate policies, we simulate the population dynamics over the time horizon $T$ for all $16$ models in the ensemble. This results in a total of $5 \\times 16 = 80$ unique trajectories per test case.\n2.  **Metric Calculation**: For each simulated trajectory, we calculate the total discounted shortfall loss and assess its viability.\n3.  **Robust Decision Analysis**: Using the full set of losses, we compute the required decision metrics for each policy: $\\mathrm{CVaR}_q$, minimax regret, and the fraction of viable trajectories.\n4.  **Optimal Policy Selection**: We identify the policy that yields the minimum $\\mathrm{CVaR}_q$ value, using the policy index as a tie-breaker.\n\nLet us detail the core calculations.\n\n**1. System Dynamics Simulation**\nFor a given test case $(T, w, n, i, q, x_{\\min})$, a single model defined by parameters $(r, \\alpha, s)$, and a policy $u = (u_w, u_n, u_i)$, the simulation proceeds as follows.\n\nFirst, the baseline driver intensities $w$, $n$, and $i$ are mitigated by the policy $u$. The post-policy effective intensities are:\n$$\nw' = w(1 - e_w u_w)\n$$\n$$\nn' = n(1 - e_n u_n)\n$$\n$$\ni' = i(1 - e_i u_i)\n$$\nwhere the effectiveness parameters are fixed at $(e_w, e_n, e_i) = (0.6, 0.5, 0.7)$.\n\nSecond, the baseline sensitivity coefficients $(\\beta_w, \\beta_n, \\beta_i) = (0.3, 0.25, 0.35)$ are scaled by the model-specific parameter $s$:\n$$\n(\\beta'_w, \\beta'_n, \\beta'_i) = (s \\cdot 0.3, s \\cdot 0.25, s \\cdot 0.35)\n$$\n\nThe per-capita loss rate, which aggregates the impacts of the effective driver intensities, is constant for a given simulation and is calculated as:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\beta'_w w' + \\beta'_n n' + \\beta'_i i' + \\alpha (w'n' + w'i' + n'i')\n$$\nThe total biomass loss at time $t$ is then $\\ell(x_t) = x_t \\lambda$.\n\nThe state update equation, representing the change in biomass from $x_t$ to $x_{t+1}$, combines logistic growth and driver-induced loss, with boundary constraints to keep the biomass within its normalized range $[0, 1]$:\n$$\nx_{t+1} = \\min\\left\\{1, \\max\\left\\{0, x_t + r x_t (1 - x_t) - x_t \\lambda \\right\\}\\right\\}\n$$\nThis update is applied iteratively for $t = 0, 1, \\dots, T-1$, starting from the initial condition $x_0 = 0.7$, to generate the full trajectory $\\{x_t\\}_{t=1}^T$.\n\n**2. Performance and Risk Metrics**\nFor each trajectory, we compute several key metrics.\n\nThe **discounted shortfall loss**, $L$, measures the cumulative deviation of the biomass from a target state $x_{\\mathrm{tar}} = 0.6$ over the horizon $T$, with future shortfalls being less important due to the discount factor $\\delta = 0.98$:\n$$\nL(p, m) = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\delta^{t-1} \\max\\{0, x_{\\mathrm{tar}} - x_t^{(p,m)}\\}\n$$\nwhere $x_t^{(p,m)}$ is the biomass at time $t$ for policy $p$ and model $m$.\n\nThe **viability** of a trajectory is a binary outcome. A trajectory is deemed viable if the biomass never drops below a critical threshold $x_{\\min}$ for the duration of the simulation (from $t=1$ to $T$):\n$$\n\\text{IsViable}(p,m) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } \\min_{t \\in \\{1,\\dots,T\\}} x_t^{(p,m)} \\ge x_{\\min} \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe **viability fraction** for a policy $p$ is the average of this value across all $M=16$ models: $V(p) = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{j=1}^{M} \\text{IsViable}(p, m_j)$.\n\nThe **regret** of a policy $p$ in a model $m$, denoted $R(p,m)$, quantifies the performance gap between policy $p$ and the best possible policy for that specific model. It is calculated as:\n$$\nR(p,m) = L(p,m) - L^\\star(m), \\quad \\text{where} \\quad L^\\star(m) = \\min_{p'} L(p',m)\n$$\nThe **minimax regret** for a policy $p$ is its worst-case regret across all models, representing a robust measure of performance: $\\max_{m} R(p,m)$.\n\nThe **Conditional Value at Risk**, $\\mathrm{CVaR}_q(p)$, is a risk measure focusing on the tail of the loss distribution. For a confidence level $q$, it is the average of the worst $\\lceil (1-q)M \\rceil$ losses incurred by policy $p$ across the ensemble of models. For example, with $M=16$ and $q=0.8$, we average the worst $\\lceil (1-0.8) \\times 16 \\rceil = 4$ losses.\n\n**3. Policy Selection**\nAfter computing these metrics for all five candidate policies, we select the one that minimizes $\\mathrm{CVaR}_q$. Should a tie occur, the policy with the lower index is chosen. The final output for each test case is a list containing the index of this optimal policy and its corresponding $\\mathrm{CVaR}_q$, minimax regret, and viability fraction, with floating-point values rounded to six decimal places.
