It is scientifically grounded in the principles of matrix population models, a standard tool in ecology. It is well-posed, with all necessary data and definitions provided for a unique solution. The language is objective and the setup is internally consistent and physically plausible within the specified domain.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part solution: first, to compute the critical temperature $T^{\\star}$ at which the population growth rate is unity, and second, to identify the demographic bottleneck at this temperature by comparing the elasticities of the growth rate with respect to juvenile and adult survival.\n\nThe population dynamics are described by the matrix equation $n(t+1) = A(T)n(t)$, where the projection matrix is\n$$ A(T) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & F(T) \\\\ S_{j}(T) & S_{a}(T) \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe long-run multiplicative growth factor is the dominant eigenvalue, $\\lambda$, of the matrix $A(T)$.

Substituting $\\lambda = 1$ into the characteristic equation gives:\n$$ 1^{2} - S_{a}(T) \\cdot 1 - F(T)S_{j}(T) = 0 \\implies 1 - S_{a}(T) - F(T)S_{j}(T) = 0 $$\nThe vital rates are given as linear functions of temperature $T$:\n$$ S_{j}(T) = 0.5 - 0.005(T-20) $$\n$$ S_{a}(T) = 0.6 - 0.01(T-20) $$\n$$ F(T) = 0.8 - 0.01(T-20) $$\nLet us define a shifted temperature variable $\\Delta T = T - 20$.

The second solution, $T = 400$, is outside this range. Therefore, the only valid critical temperature is $T^{\\star} = 20$ degrees Celsius. Rounded to three significant figures, this is $20.0$.\n\nPart 2: Determination of the demographic bottleneck.\nWe must compare the elasticities of $\\lambda$ with respect to juvenile survival $S_{j}$ and adult survival $S_{a}$ at $T^{\\star} = 20$. The elasticity of $\\lambda$ with respect to a matrix element $a_{ij}$ is given by\n$$ e_{ij} = \\frac{a_{ij}}{\\lambda} \\frac{\\partial \\lambda}{\\partial a_{ij}} = \\frac{a_{ij}}{\\lambda} \\frac{v_i w_j}{\\langle v, w \\rangle} $$\nwhere $w$ is the right eigenvector (stable stage distribution), $v$ is the left eigenvector (reproductive values), and $\\langle v, w \\rangle = v^{T}w$ is their scalar product. We are comparing $e_{S_{j}} = e_{21}$ and $e_{S_{a}} = e_{22}$.\n\nAt $T^{\\star} = 20$, we have $\\Delta T = 0$, so the vital rates are:\n$S_{j} = 0.5$, $S_{a} = 0.6$, $F = 0.8$.\nThe matrix is $A(20) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0.8 \\\\ 0.5 & 0.6 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\lambda = 1$.\n\nFirst, find the right eigenvector $w = \\begin{pmatrix} w_1 \\\\ w_2 \\end{pmatrix}$ from $A w = \\lambda w$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0.8 \\\\ 0.5 & 0.6 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} w_1 \\\\ w_2 \\end{pmatrix} = 1 \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} w_1 \\\\ w_2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis yields the system of equations: $0.8 w_2 = w_1$ and $0.5 w_1 + 0.6 w_2 = w_2$. The equations are consistent. Choosing $w_2 = 1$, we get $w_1 = 0.8$. So, $w = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.8 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nNext, find the left eigenvector $v = \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix}$ from $v^{T}A = \\lambda v^{T}$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 & v_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0.8 \\\\ 0.5 & 0.6 \\end{pmatrix} = 1 \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 & v_2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis yields: $0.5 v_2 = v_1$ and $0.8 v_1 + 0.6 v_2 = v_2$. The equations are consistent. Choosing $v_1 = 1$, we get $v_2 = 1/0.5 = 2$. So, $v = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe scalar product is $\\langle v, w \\rangle = v_1 w_1 + v_2 w_2 = (1)(0.8) + (2)(1) = 0.8 + 2 = 2.8$.\n\nNow we compute the elasticities. The survival components are $S_j = a_{21}$ and $S_a = a_{22}$.\nElasticity for juvenile survival, $S_{j}$:\n$$ e_{S_{j}} = e_{21} = \\frac{a_{21} v_2 w_1}{\\lambda \\langle v, w \\rangle} = \\frac{0.5 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 0.8}{1 \\cdot 2.8} = \\frac{0.8}{2.8} = \\frac{8}{28} = \\frac{2}{7} $$\nElasticity for adult survival, $S_{a}$:\n$$ e_{S_{a}} = e_{22} = \\frac{a_{22} v_2 w_2}{\\lambda \\langle v, w \\rangle} = \\frac{0.6 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}{1 \\cdot 2.8} = \\frac{1.2}{2.8} = \\frac{12}{28} = \\frac{3}{7} $$\nComparing the two values: $e_{S_{a}} = 3/7 > 2/7 = e_{S_{j}}$.\nThe elasticity of the population growth rate with respect to adult survival is greater than that for juvenile survival. Therefore, the adult stage is the demographic bottleneck. According to the problem's indexing, this corresponds to $k^{\\star} = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is the row vector $\\begin{pmatrix} T^{\\star} & k^{\\star} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$T^{\\star}$ rounded to three significant figures is $20.0$.\n$k^{\\star}$ is $2$.\nThe result is $\\begin{pmatrix} 20.0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n20.0 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2495608"}, {"introduction": "Organisms rarely face environmental stressors in isolation; a key challenge is to understand their combined effects.

The solution is obtained by direct simulation, according to the ergodic hypothesis, which posits that the long-term time average of the process converges to its ensemble average. The methodology is implemented as a computational algorithm.\n\nThe core of the problem is to simulate the environmental driver $E_t$ and then use the resulting time series to compute the per-step log growth rates $g_t$. The estimate for $\\gamma$ is then the arithmetic mean of $g_t$ over a sufficiently long period after an initial burn-in phase.\n\nThe simulation procedure is as follows:\n\n$1$. **Initialization**: The simulation runs for a total of $B+T$ time steps, where $T = 200,000$ is the number of steps for averaging and $B = 5,000$ is the burn-in period. A fixed random seed of $2025$ is used to initialize the pseudo-random number generator, ensuring reproducibility. This generator is used to produce a sequence of $B+T$ independent and identically distributed standard normal random variables, $Z_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, for $t=1, \\dots, B+T$.\n\n$2$. **Environmental Driver Simulation**: The environmental driver $E_t$ is governed by a stationary Autoregressive of order $1$ (AR($1$)) process. A time series for $E_t$ of length $B+T+1$ (from $t=0$ to $t=B+T$) is generated. The process is initialized at its mean, $E_0 = \\mu$. Subsequent values are generated recursively using the provided equation:\n$$\nE_t = \\mu + \\phi (E_{t-1} - \\mu) + \\sigma \\sqrt{1-\\phi^2} \\, Z_t \\quad \\text{for } t=1, 2, \\dots, B+T\n$$\nThis generation is performed for each set of parameters $(\\mu, \\sigma, \\phi, s, k, h, r_{\\mathrm{bar}})$ provided in the test suite.\n\n$3$. **Log Growth Rate Calculation**: After generating the environmental time series $E_t$, the per-step log growth rates $g_t$ are calculated for the post-burn-in period, i.e., for $t = B+1, \\dots, B+T$. The calculation uses the specified log-linear-quadratic function:\n$$\ng_t = r_{\\mathrm{bar}} + s \\, E_t - k \\, E_t^2 - h \\, E_t E_{t-1}\n$$\nThis step produces a series of $T$ values for $g_t$.\n\n$4$. **Estimation of $\\gamma$**: The long-run log growth rate $\\gamma$ is estimated by computing the arithmetic mean of the $T$ post-burn-in values of $g_t$. This estimate, denoted $\\hat{\\gamma}$, is given by:\n$$\n\\hat{\\gamma} = \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=B+1}^{B+T} g_t\n$$\nThis numerical time average serves as an approximation to the theoretical limit $\\gamma = \\lim_{T \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^T \\log \\lambda_t$, which is equivalent to the expectation $\\mathbb{E}[g_t]$ for a stationary process.\n\n$5$. **Output Formatting**: The procedure is repeated for each of the $8$ test cases.
