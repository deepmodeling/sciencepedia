The problem assumes linear equilibrium partitioning dominated by sediment organic matter. Under this assumption, $K_d$ is related to the organic carbon–water partition coefficient, $K_{oc}$, and the fraction of organic carbon in the sediment, $f_{oc}$, by the equation:\n$$K_d = K_{oc} \\cdot f_{oc}$$\nThe value of $K_{oc}$ must first be calculated from its given logarithm.

The sediment–water distribution coefficient, $K_d$, is defined as the ratio of the pollutant concentration in the sediment ($C_s$) to its concentration in the water ($C_w$) at equilibrium:\n$$K_d = \\frac{C_s}{C_w}$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for $C_s$ gives:\n$$C_s = K_d \\cdot C_w$$\nUsing the calculated value of $K_d = 2000\\,\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$ and the given dissolved-phase concentration $C_w = 100\\,\\mathrm{ng}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$:\n$$C_s = (2000\\,\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}) \\cdot (100\\,\\mathrm{ng}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}) = 200000\\,\\mathrm{ng}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$$\nThe unit analysis confirms the result is in the required units of $\\mathrm{ng}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$.

It describes a standard single-compartment first-order kinetic model used in ecotoxicology, which is a valid scientific problem. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the concentration of the Persistent Organic Pollutant (POP) in the predator, $C_{\\mathrm{pred}}(t)$, is the conservation of mass. The rate of change of the POP concentration is the difference between the rate of gain from dietary uptake and the rate of loss from physiological elimination and growth dilution.\n\nLet us construct the differential equation for $\\frac{dC_{\\mathrm{pred}}}{dt}$. All rates are expressed per unit predator biomass.\n\n$1$. The rate of POP gain is from consumption of prey. The predator consumes prey at a mass-specific rate of $F$. The concentration of POP in the prey is $C_{\\mathrm{prey}}$. Thus, the mass-specific rate of POP ingestion is $F C_{\\mathrm{prey}}$. The fraction of this ingested POP that is assimilated is $\\alpha$. Therefore, the rate of POP assimilation per unit predator biomass is:\n$$ \\text{Rate of Gain} = \\alpha F C_{\\mathrm{prey}} $$\nThe units are $(\\text{unitless}) \\times (\\mathrm{g}_{\\text{prey}} \\cdot \\mathrm{g}_{\\text{pred}}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathrm{d}^{-1}) \\times (\\mathrm{ng}_{\\text{POP}} \\cdot \\mathrm{g}_{\\text{prey}}^{-1}) = \\mathrm{ng}_{\\text{POP}} \\cdot \\mathrm{g}_{\\text{pred}}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathrm{d}^{-1}$, which is a rate of change of concentration, as required.\n\n$2$. The rate of POP loss is the sum of two first-order processes acting on the predator's internal concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{pred}}$.\na) Physiological elimination occurs with a rate constant $k_e$. The loss rate is $k_e C_{\\mathrm{pred}}$.\nb) Growth dilution arises because the predator's biomass increases at a specific rate $g$. This increase in mass dilutes the existing body burden of the pollutant, resulting in a decrease in concentration. This process is mathematically equivalent to a first-order loss term, $g C_{\\mathrm{pred}}$.\nThe total rate of loss per unit predator biomass is the sum of these two components:\n$$ \\text{Rate of Loss} = (k_e + g) C_{\\mathrm{pred}} $$\n\nCombining the gain and loss terms, we form the governing ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dC_{\\mathrm{pred}}}{dt} = \\text{Rate of Gain} - \\text{Rate of Loss} $$\n$$ \\frac{dC_{\\mathrm{pred}}}{dt} = \\alpha F C_{\\mathrm{prey}} - (k_e + g) C_{\\mathrm{pred}} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the steady-state concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{pred}}^{\\ast}$. At steady state, the concentration no longer changes with time, which implies $\\frac{dC_{\\mathrm{pred}}}{dt} = 0$.
