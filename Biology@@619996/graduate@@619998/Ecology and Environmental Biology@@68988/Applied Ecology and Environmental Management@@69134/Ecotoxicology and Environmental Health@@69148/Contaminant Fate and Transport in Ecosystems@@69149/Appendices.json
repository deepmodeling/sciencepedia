In practice, with discrete data $\\{(t_i, C_i)\\}_{i=1}^N$, one approximates $m_k \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \\tfrac{1}{2} (t_{i+1}-t_i)\\left(t_i^k C_i + t_{i+1}^k C_{i+1}\\right)$ after baseline correction.\n\nFrom the conservative breakthrough, estimate\n$$\n\\hat{\\bar t}_c = \\frac{\\hat m_{1,c}}{\\hat m_{0,c}}, \\quad \\hat \\sigma_{t,c}^2 = \\frac{\\hat m_{2,c}}{\\hat m_{0,c}} - \\left(\\frac{\\hat m_{1,c}}{\\hat m_{0,c}}\\right)^2,\n$$\nthen\n$$\n\\hat v = \\frac{L}{\\hat{\\bar t}_c}, \\qquad \\hat D = \\frac{\\hat \\sigma_{t,c}^2\\, \\hat v^3}{2 L}.\n$$\nFrom the reactive breakthrough, estimate\n$$\n\\hat{\\bar t}_r = \\frac{\\hat m_{1,r}}{\\hat m_{0,r}}, \\qquad \\hat R = \\frac{\\hat{\\bar t}_r}{\\hat{\\bar t}_c},\n$$\nand optionally check the internal consistency $\\hat \\sigma_{t,r}^2 \\approx \\hat R^2 \\hat \\sigma_{t,c}^2$.\n\nWe now evaluate each option:\n\nOption A: This option computes temporal moments via quadrature, forms centroid time and central variance for each curve, and then uses\n- $\\hat v = L/\\bar t_c$, consistent with $\\bar t_c = L/v$,\n- $\\hat D = (\\sigma_{t,c}^2 \\hat v^3)/(2 L)$, consistent with $\\sigma_{t,c}^2 = 2 D L / v^3$,\n- $\\hat R = \\bar t_r/\\bar t_c$, consistent with $\\bar t_r = R \\bar t_c$,\n- with a check $\\sigma_{t,r}^2 \\approx R^2 \\sigma_{t,c}^2$, consistent with time scaling by $R$.\nAll steps are consistent with the ADE and mass conservation and do not require injected mass or area. Verdict: Correct.\n\nOption B: This option relies on peak time $t_{p}$ and half-maximum widths. For the ADE, the peak time differs from the mean and is sensitive to dispersion and early-time dynamics; Gaussian fits in time at fixed $x$ are inappropriate because the time-of-arrival distribution is inverse Gaussian, not Gaussian. Estimating $R$ by the ratio of peak times is not moment matching and is biased by skewness. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption C: While $\\hat v = L/\\bar t_c$ is correct, the expression $\\hat D = (\\sigma_{t,c}^2 \\hat v)/(2 L)$ omits a factor $\\hat v^2$; dimensionally, $[\\sigma_{t,c}^2] = T^2$ and $[\\hat v/(L)] = T^{-1}$, yielding $T$, not $L^2/T$. The correct formula requires $\\hat v^3$. Furthermore, estimating $R$ by the variance ratio $\\sigma_{t,r}^2/\\sigma_{t,c}^2$ yields $\\hat R^2$, not $\\hat R$; the correct scaling is $\\sigma_{t,r}^2 = R^2 \\sigma_{t,c}^2$, so $R = \\sigma_{t,r}/\\sigma_{t,c}$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption D: Using $m_{0,c}$ to estimate $v$ via $\\hat v = m_{0,c}/L$ is not dimensionally or physically correct; $m_{0,c}$ has units of concentration times time, and without knowledge of injected mass and cross-sectional area, $m_{0,c}$ cannot yield $v$. Moreover, the area under the breakthrough is, under steady flow, independent of retardation for linear equilibrium sorption, so $\\hat R = m_{0,r}/m_{0,c}$ is not valid. The proposed $D$ estimator also has inconsistent units and lacks the correct dependence on $\\hat v$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the scientifically consistent and implementable procedure is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2478751"}]}
