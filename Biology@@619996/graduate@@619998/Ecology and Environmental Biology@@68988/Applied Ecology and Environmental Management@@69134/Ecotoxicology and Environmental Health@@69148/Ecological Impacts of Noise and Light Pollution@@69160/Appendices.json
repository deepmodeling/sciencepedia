The physical basis for averaging the square of the pressure, $p^2(t)$, is that the acoustic energy flux is proportional to this quantity. Therefore, the average of $p^2(t)$ is a measure of the average acoustic energy delivered over the time interval.\n\nThe time-averaged mean-square acoustic pressure, denoted as $\\langle p^2 \\rangle_T$, over the time interval $[0, T]$ is defined by the integral:\n$$\n\\langle p^2 \\rangle_T = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} p^2(t) \\, dt\n$$\nAccording to the problem's definition of $L_{eq,T}$, this level is calculated from $\\langle p^2 \\rangle_T$ using the same formula as for an instantaneous level:\n$$\nL_{eq,T} = 10 \\log_{10} \\! \\left( \\frac{\\langle p^2 \\rangle_T}{p_0^2} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $p_0$ is the reference pressure. Substituting the integral expression for $\\langle p^2 \\rangle_T$ gives:\n$$\nL_{eq,T} = 10 \\log_{10} \\! \\left( \\frac{1}{p_0^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} p^2(t) \\, dt \\right) = 10 \\log_{10} \\! \\left( \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} \\frac{p^2(t)}{p_0^2} \\, dt \\right)\n$$\nTo express $L_{eq,T}$ as a functional of $L(t)$, we must find a relation for the term $p^2(t)/p_0^2$ from the definition of $L(t)$. The instantaneous Sound Pressure Level $L(t)$ is given as:\n$$\nL(t) = 10 \\log_{10} \\! \\left( \\frac{p^2(t)}{p_0^2} \\right)\n$$\nTo invert this relation, we first divide by $10$:\n$$\n\\frac{L(t)}{10} = \\log_{10} \\! \\left( \\frac{p^2(t)}{p_0^2} \\right)\n$$\nNext, we exponentiate both sides with base $10$:\n$$\n10^{\\frac{L(t)}{10}} = \\frac{p^2(t)}{p_0^2}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for the ratio $p^2(t)/p_0^2$ back into the integral for $L_{eq,T}$:\n$$\nL_{eq,T} = 10 \\log_{10} \\! \\left( \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} 10^{\\frac{L(t)}{10}} \\, dt \\right)\n$$\nThis is the required general expression for the equivalent continuous sound level $L_{eq,T}$ as a functional of the instantaneous level $L(t)$ over the interval $[0, T]$.\n\nPart 2: Calculation for the specified duty cycle.\n\nWe are given a two-level duty cycle over a total period of $T = 3600\\,\\mathrm{s}$.

Derivation of Detection Radius $R(N)$**\n\nThe problem specifies that the received sound level decreases due to spherical spreading, with a loss of $\\alpha = 20$ decibels (dB) per decade of distance. Let $S_0$ be the source level at a reference distance of $d_{\\text{ref}} = 1$ meter.

The maximum detection distance, which we denote as the detection radius $R$, is the distance at which the SNR is exactly equal to this criterion:\n$$\\text{SNR}(R) = \\theta$$\nSubstituting the expression for SNR, we obtain the equation:\n$$S_0 - 20 \\log_{10}(R) - N = \\theta$$\nWe must now solve this equation for $R$. Rearranging the terms to isolate $\\log_{10}(R)$:\n$$20 \\log_{10}(R) = S_0 - N - \\theta$$\n$$\\log_{10}(R) = \\frac{S_0 - N - \\theta}{20}$$\nFinally, by applying the inverse function of the base-$10$ logarithm (i.e., exponentiation with base $10$), we find the expression for the detection radius $R$ as a function of the noise level $N$:\n$$R(N) = 10^{\\frac{S_0 - N - \\theta}{20}}$$\nThis is the required expression.

Derivation of Mating Probability $p_{\\mathrm{mate}}$**\n\nMales are assumed to be distributed according to a homogeneous Poisson point process over a habitat of area $A$. The intensity, or density, of this process is $\\lambda = M/A$, where $M$ is the total number of males. A female, located at any point in this habitat, can detect any male within a circular area of radius $R(N)$ centered on her position. The area of this detection region is:\n$$A_{\\text{det}} = \\pi R(N)^2$$\nAccording to the properties of a homogeneous Poisson point process, the number of points (males), $k$, found within any region of area $x$ is a Poisson-distributed random variable with mean $\\mu = \\lambda x$.

The probability of this event, $p_{\\mathrm{mate}}$, is most easily calculated as one minus the probability of the complementary event, $k=0$ (detecting no males).\n$$p_{\\mathrm{mate}} = P(k \\ge 1) = 1 - P(k=0)$$\nFor a Poisson distribution, the probability of observing zero events is given by:\n$$P(k=0) = \\frac{e^{-\\mu}\\mu^0}{0!} = e^{-\\mu}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $p_{\\text{mate}}$, we arrive at the per-female probability of mating:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{mate}} = 1 - e^{-\\mu} = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{M}{A}\\pi R(N)^2\\right)$$\nThis expression correctly formalizes the relationship between male density, habitat area, and the acoustically determined detection radius.\n\n**3. Derivation of Stochastic Population Transition $N_{t} \\to N_{t+1}$**\n\nThe population model proceeds in discrete, non-overlapping generations. We start with a total population size of $N_t$ at generation $t$.\nFirst, the population is divided into males and females. The number of males is $M_t = \\lfloor N_t/2 \\rfloor$ and the number of females is $F_t = N_t - M_t = \\lceil N_t/2 \\rceil$.\nEach of the $F_t$ females has a probability $p_{\\text{mate}}$ of mating, with mating events being independent across females. Thus, the number of mated females, $F_{\\text{mated}}$, follows a binomial distribution, $F_{\\text{mated}} \\sim \\text{Binomial}(F_t, p_{\\text{mate}})$.\nEach mated female produces a number of eggs that is a random variate from a Poisson distribution with mean $b$. The total number of eggs produced in the generation is $E_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{F_{\\text{mated}}} E_i$, where $E_i \\sim \\text{Poisson}(b)$. This sum constitutes a compound distribution. For analytical and computational simplicity, we make a standard simplification: we approximate the distribution of the total number of eggs, $E_{\\text{total}}$, with a single Poisson distribution whose mean is equal to the expected total number of eggs. This approximation preserves the mean of the reproductive process.\nThe expected number of mated females is $E[F_{\\text{mated}}] = F_t \\cdot p_{\\text{mate}}$.\nThe expected total number of eggs is $E[E_{\\text{total}}] = E[F_{\\text{mated}}] \\cdot b = F_t \\cdot p_{\\text{mate}} \\cdot b$.\nThus, we model the total egg count as:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_{\\text{eggs}}), \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\lambda_{\\text{eggs}} = F_t \\cdot p_{\\text{mate}} \\cdot b$$\nNext, each of these $E_{\\text{total}}$ eggs survives to become an adult in the next generation with an independent probability $s$. The number of new adults, $N_{t+1}$, is therefore the result of binomial sampling from a Poisson-distributed population. This is a process known as Poisson thinning. A fundamental theorem of probability states that if a random variable $K \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)$ and a second variable $N$ is conditionally distributed as $N|K \\sim \\text{Binomial}(K, p)$, then the unconditional distribution of $N$ is also Poisson, with mean $\\lambda p$.\nApplying this exact result to our model, the number of individuals in the next generation, $N_{t+1}$, follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda_{t+1} = \\lambda_{\\text{eggs}} \\cdot s$:\n$$N_{t+1} \\sim \\text{Poisson}(F_t \\cdot p_{\\text{mate}} \\cdot b \\cdot s)$$\nBy substituting the full expressions for $F_t$ and $p_{\\text{mate}}$, we obtain the complete stochastic transition rule for the population abundance:\n$$N_{t+1} \\sim \\text{Poisson}\\left(\\lceil N_t/2 \\rceil \\cdot b \\cdot s \\cdot \\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lfloor N_t/2 \\rfloor}{A}\\pi \\left(10^{\\frac{S_0 - N - \\theta}{20}}\\right)^2\\right)\\right]\\right)$$\nThis transition rule integrates the effects of acoustic masking on mating success and subsequent demographic consequences.\n\n**4. Monte Carlo Simulation**\n\nTo estimate the extinction probability $\\hat{q}$, we implement a Monte Carlo simulation based on the derived stochastic transition rule. For each test case defined by parameters ($N, N_0, T, R$), the procedure is as follows:\n1.  Initialize an extinction counter to zero.\n2.  Perform $R$ independent replicate simulations.\n3.  For each replicate, start with an initial population $N_0$ at generation $t=0$.\n4.  Iterate the population for $T$ generations. In each generation $t$, calculate the new population size $N_{t+1}$ by drawing a random number from the Poisson distribution derived in the previous section.\n5.  If at any point during the simulation (i.e., for any generation $t \\in \\{1, \\dots, T\\}$) the population size $N_t$ becomes $0$, the population is declared extinct for that replicate, and the simulation for that replicate terminates.\n6.  If a replicate's population size becomes $0$ at or before generation $T$, increment the extinction counter.\n7.  After all $R$ replicates are completed, the estimated extinction probability $\\hat{q}$ is calculated as the total number of extinctions divided by the total number of replicates, $R$.\n\nThe following code implements this simulation to solve the given problem.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the ecological modeling problem by simulating population dynamics\n    under different noise regimes and estimating extinction probabilities.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define constants from the problem statement\n    A = 10**6  # Habitat area in square meters\n    alpha = 20  # Spherical spreading coefficient in dB/decade\n    S0 = 90  # Source level at 1 meter in dB\n    theta = 10  # Detection criterion in dB\n    b = 4  # Baseline fecundity (eggs per mated female)\n    s = 0.4  # Juvenile survival to adulthood\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each tuple is (N, N0, T, R)\n    test_cases = [\n        (30, 100, 50, 2000),  # Case 1\n        (50, 100, 50, 2000),  # Case 2\n        (70, 100, 50, 2000),  # Case 3\n        (90, 100, 50, 2000),  # Case 4\n        (50, 2, 50, 2000),   # Case 5\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for N_noise, N0, T, R_replicates in test_cases:\n        \n        # Calculate noise-dependent detection radius R(N)\n        # This is constant for a given test case.\n        # The exponent can be negative, which is valid and gives R < 1.\n        exponent = (S0 - N_noise - theta) / alpha\n        detection_radius = 10**exponent\n        detection_area = np.pi * detection_radius**2\n        \n        extinction_count = 0\n        for _ in range(R_replicates):\n            current_N = N0\n            extinct = False\n            \n            for _ in range(T):\n                if current_N == 0:\n                    extinct = True\n                    break\n                \n                # Determine number of males and females\n                males = np.floor(current_N / 2)\n                females = current_N - males\n                \n                # If there are no males or no females, no reproduction can occur.\n                if males == 0 or females == 0:\n                    current_N = 0\n                    continue\n\n                # Calculate per-female probability of mating\n                # This depends on the number of males M_t and detection area\n                mu = (males / A) * detection_area\n                p_mate = 1 - np.exp(-mu)\n                \n                # Calculate the mean of the Poisson distribution for the next generation\n                lambda_next_gen = females * p_mate * b * s\n                \n                # Draw the next population size from the Poisson distribution\n                current_N = np.random.poisson(lambda_next_gen)\n\n            # Check for extinction at or before the terminal generation T\n            if extinct or current_N == 0:\n                extinction_count += 1\n        \n        # Estimate extinction probability\n        q_hat = extinction_count / R_replicates\n        results.append(q_hat)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # Results are rounded to three decimal places.\n    print(f\"[{','.join([f'{r:.3f}' for r in results])}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2483119"}]}
