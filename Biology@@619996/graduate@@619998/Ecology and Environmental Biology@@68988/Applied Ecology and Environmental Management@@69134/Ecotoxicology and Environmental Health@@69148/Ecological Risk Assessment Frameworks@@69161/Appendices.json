Round all three outputs to six decimal places.\n\nTest suite (parameters are provided on the log-scale where relevant):\n- Case A (moderate overlap):\n  - $\\mu_E = \\ln(10)$, $\\sigma_E = 0.6$, $\\mu_T = \\ln(12)$, $\\sigma_T = 0.5$, $\\rho_{ET} = 0.3$\n  - $\\mu_S = \\ln(8)$, $\\sigma_S = 0.7$, $\\rho_{ES} = 0.0$\n- Case B (low exposure relative to toxicity and sensitivity):\n  - $\\mu_E = \\ln(0.1)$, $\\sigma_E = 0.3$, $\\mu_T = \\ln(5)$, $\\sigma_T = 0.4$, $\\rho_{ET} = 0.2$\n  - $\\mu_S = \\ln(3)$, $\\sigma_S = 0.6$, $\\rho_{ES} = 0.0$\n- Case C (high exposure and strong positive correlation with toxicity; moderate correlation with sensitivity):\n  - $\\mu_E = \\ln(50)$, $\\sigma_E = 0.8$, $\\mu_T = \\ln(40)$, $\\sigma_T = 0.7$, $\\rho_{ET} = 0.9$\n  - $\\mu_S = \\ln(5)$, $\\sigma_S = 1.0$, $\\rho_{ES} = 0.5$\n- Case D (boundary degeneracy in exceedance; independent sensitivity):\n  - $\\mu_E = \\ln(10)$, $\\sigma_E = 0.5$, $\\mu_T = \\ln(10)$, $\\sigma_T = 0.5$, $\\rho_{ET} = 1.0$\n  - $\\mu_S = \\ln(15)$, $\\sigma_S = 0.9$, $\\rho_{ES} = 0.0$\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a list of lists, one inner list per test case, each inner list ordered as $[R_1,R_2,Q_{0.95}]$. The line must be enclosed in square brackets and the elements comma-separated, for example: \n  - $[[r_{1,A},r_{2,A},q_{0.95,A}],[r_{1,B},r_{2,B},q_{0.95,B}],[r_{1,C},r_{2,C},q_{0.95,C}],[r_{1,D},r_{2,D},q_{0.95,D}]]$.\n- Report $R_1$ and $R_2$ as decimal fractions and $Q_{0.95}$ as a unitless ratio. Round each value to six decimal places.", "solution": "The problem presented is a standard exercise in probabilistic ecological risk assessment. It is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The task is to derive and compute three risk metrics from first principles as specified. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nLet $X_E = \\ln E$, $X_T = \\ln T$, and $X_S = \\ln S$. Per the problem statement, we have the following givens:\n- $X_E \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_E, \\sigma_E^2)$\n- $X_T \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_T, \\sigma_T^2)$\n- $X_S \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_S, \\sigma_S^2)$\n- The pair $(X_E, X_T)$ is jointly normal with correlation $\\rho_{ET}$.\n- The pair $(X_E, X_S)$ is jointly normal with correlation $\\rho_{ES}$.\n\nThe derivations will rely on a fundamental property of multivariate normal distributions: any linear combination of jointly normally distributed random variables is itself normally distributed.\n\n**1. Derivation of Exceedance Probability $R_1 = \\mathbb{P}(HQ > 1)$**\n\nThe hazard quotient is defined as $HQ = E/T$. The risk metric $R_1$ is the probability that this quotient exceeds $1$.\n$$ R_1 = \\mathbb{P}(HQ > 1) = \\mathbb{P}(E/T > 1) $$\nSince $E$ and $T$ represent physical quantities (exposure and toxicity), they are strictly positive. The natural logarithm function, $\\ln(x)$, is strictly monotonically increasing for $x > 0$. Therefore, the inequality can be transformed by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(E/T > 1) = \\mathbb{P}(\\ln(E/T) > \\ln(1)) = \\mathbb{P}(\\ln E - \\ln T > 0) $$\nLet us define a new random variable $D_1 = X_E - X_T = \\ln E - \\ln T$. Since $X_E$ and $X_T$ are jointly normally distributed, their linear combination $D_1$ is also normally distributed, $D_1 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{D_1}, \\sigma_{D_1}^2)$.\n\nThe mean of $D_1$ is found by the linearity of expectation:\n$$ \\mu_{D_1} = \\mathbb{E}[D_1] = \\mathbb{E}[X_E - X_T] = \\mathbb{E}[X_E] - \\mathbb{E}[X_T] = \\mu_E - \\mu_T $$\nThe variance of $D_1$ is:\n$$ \\sigma_{D_1}^2 = \\text{Var}(D_1) = \\text{Var}(X_E - X_T) = \\text{Var}(X_E) + \\text{Var}(X_T) - 2 \\text{Cov}(X_E, X_T) $$\nGiven that $\\text{Cov}(X_E, X_T) = \\rho_{ET} \\sigma_E \\sigma_T$, the variance becomes:\n$$ \\sigma_{D_1}^2 = \\sigma_E^2 + \\sigma_T^2 - 2 \\rho_{ET} \\sigma_E \\sigma_T $$\nThe probability $R_1$ is thus $\\mathbb{P}(D_1 > 0)$. To compute this, we standardize the variable $D_1$. Let $Z$ be a standard normal variable, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. If $\\sigma_{D_1} > 0$:\n$$ R_1 = \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\frac{D_1 - \\mu_{D_1}}{\\sigma_{D_1}} > \\frac{0 - \\mu_{D_1}}{\\sigma_{D_1}}\\right) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(Z > -\\frac{\\mu_{D_1}}{\\sigma_{D_1}}\\right) $$\nBy the symmetry of the standard normal distribution, $\\mathbb{P}(Z > -z) = \\mathbb{P}(Z < z) = \\Phi(z)$, where $\\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution. Therefore:\n$$ R_1 = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{D_1}}{\\sigma_{D_1}}\\right) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\mu_E - \\mu_T}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_E^2 + \\sigma_T^2 - 2 \\rho_{ET} \\sigma_E \\sigma_T}}\\right) $$\nIn the boundary case where $\\sigma_{D_1}^2 = 0$, the variable $D_1$ is a constant equal to its mean, $\\mu_{D_1}$. The distribution is a degenerate normal distribution. The probability $\\mathbb{P}(D_1 > 0)$ becomes:\n$$ R_1 = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } \\mu_{D_1} > 0 \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } \\mu_{D_1} \\le 0 \\end{cases} $$\nThis condition $\\sigma_{D_1}^2 = 0$ occurs if and only if $X_E$ is a linear function of $X_T$ with slope $1$, meaning $\\sigma_E = \\sigma_T$ and $\\rho_{ET} = 1$.\n\n**2. Derivation of Potentially Affected Fraction $R_2 = \\mathbb{P}(S < E)$**\n\nThe logic for deriving $R_2$ is identical to that for $R_1$. The metric is defined as $R_2 = \\mathbb{P}(S < E)$. Since $S$ and $E$ are positive, we can again apply the natural logarithm:\n$$ R_2 = \\mathbb{P}(\\ln S < \\ln E) = \\mathbb{P}(\\ln E - \\ln S > 0) $$\nWe define a new random variable $D_2 = X_E - X_S = \\ln E - \\ln S$. As $(X_E, X_S)$ are jointly normal, $D_2$ is normal, $D_2 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{D_2}, \\sigma_{D_2}^2)$.\n\nThe mean of $D_2$ is:\n$$ \\mu_{D_2} = \\mathbb{E}[D_2] = \\mathbb{E}[X_E - X_S] = \\mu_E - \\mu_S $$\nThe variance of $D_2$ is:\n$$ \\sigma_{D_2}^2 = \\text{Var}(D_2) = \\text{Var}(X_E - X_S) = \\text{Var}(X_E) + \\text{Var}(X_S) - 2 \\text{Cov}(X_E, X_S) $$\nWith $\\text{Cov}(X_E, X_S) = \\rho_{ES} \\sigma_E \\sigma_S$, this is:\n$$ \\sigma_{D_2}^2 = \\sigma_E^2 + \\sigma_S^2 - 2 \\rho_{ES} \\sigma_E \\sigma_S $$\nThe probability $R_2$ is $\\mathbb{P}(D_2 > 0)$. Following the same standardization as before:\n$$ R_2 = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{D_2}}{\\sigma_{D_2}}\\right) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\mu_E - \\mu_S}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_E^2 + \\sigma_S^2 - 2 \\rho_{ES} \\sigma_E \\sigma_S}}\\right) $$\nThe boundary case $\\sigma_{D_2}^2 = 0$ is handled analogously.\n\n**3. Derivation of the $95^{\\text{th}}$ Percentile of HQ, $Q_{0.95}$**\n\nWe seek the value $q = Q_{0.95}$ such that $\\mathbb{P}(HQ \\le q) = 0.95$.\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(E/T \\le q) = 0.95 $$\nTaking the logarithm, this is equivalent to finding $q$ such that:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(\\ln(E/T) \\le \\ln q) = 0.95 $$\nThe term $\\ln(E/T)$ is precisely the variable $D_1 = X_E - X_T$ from the first derivation. Thus, we must solve for $\\ln q$ in the equation:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(D_1 \\le \\ln q) = 0.95 $$\nStandardizing the variable $D_1$ (for $\\sigma_{D_1} > 0$), we get:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\frac{D_1 - \\mu_{D_1}}{\\sigma_{D_1}} \\le \\frac{\\ln q - \\mu_{D_1}}{\\sigma_{D_1}}\\right) = 0.95 $$\nThis implies that the term on the right is the $95^{\\text{th}}$ percentile of the standard normal distribution, which we denote $z_{0.95} = \\Phi^{-1}(0.95)$.\n$$ \\frac{\\ln q - \\mu_{D_1}}{\\sigma_{D_1}} = z_{0.95} $$\nSolving for $\\ln q$:\n$$ \\ln q = \\mu_{D_1} + z_{0.95} \\sigma_{D_1} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\mu_{D_1}$ and $\\sigma_{D_1}$:\n$$ \\ln Q_{0.95} = (\\mu_E - \\mu_T) + z_{0.95} \\sqrt{\\sigma_E^2 + \\sigma_T^2 - 2 \\rho_{ET} \\sigma_E \\sigma_T} $$\nFinally, we exponentiate to obtain $Q_{0.95}$:\n$$ Q_{0.95} = \\exp\\left( (\\mu_E - \\mu_T) + z_{0.95} \\sqrt{\\sigma_E^2 + \\sigma_T^2 - 2 \\rho_{ET} \\sigma_E \\sigma_T} \\right) $$\nIn the boundary case where $\\sigma_{D_1}^2 = 0$, $D_1 = \\ln(HQ)$ is the constant $\\mu_{D_1}$. Thus, $HQ$ is the constant $\\exp(\\mu_{D_1})$. For any non-degenerate distribution, the $p$-th percentile is the value below which $p \\times 100\\%$ of the probability mass lies. For a constant $C$, the $p$-th percentile for any $p \\in (0, 1]$ is simply $C$. Therefore, if $\\sigma_{D_1}^2 = 0$, then $Q_{0.95} = \\exp(\\mu_{D_1}) = \\exp(\\mu_E - \\mu_T)$. This result is consistent with the general formula when $\\sigma_{D_1} \\to 0$.\n\nThese derived expressions are now implemented to solve the test cases.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and calculates ecological risk metrics based on lognormal distributions\n    for exposure and toxicity/sensitivity endpoints.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Parameters: (mu_E_val, sigma_E, mu_T_val, sigma_T, rho_ET, mu_S_val, sigma_S, rho_ES)\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A (moderate overlap)\n        (10.0, 0.6, 12.0, 0.5, 0.3, 8.0, 0.7, 0.0),\n        # Case B (low exposure relative to toxicity and sensitivity)\n        (0.1, 0.3, 5.0, 0.4, 0.2, 3.0, 0.6, 0.0),\n        # Case C (high exposure and strong positive correlation)\n        (50.0, 0.8, 40.0, 0.7, 0.9, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5),\n        # Case D (boundary degeneracy in exceedance)\n        (10.0, 0.5, 10.0, 0.5, 1.0, 15.0, 0.9, 0.0),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    # Tolerance for checking if variance is zero\n    ZERO_TOLERANCE = 1e-12\n    # Pre-calculate the 95th percentile of the standard normal distribution\n    z_095 = norm.ppf(0.95)\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        mu_E_val, sigma_E, mu_T_val, sigma_T, rho_ET, mu_S_val, sigma_S, rho_ES = case\n        \n        # The provided mu values are for E, T, S not ln(E), ln(T), ln(S).\n        # We must take the natural log as per problem definition.\n        mu_E = np.log(mu_E_val)\n        mu_T = np.log(mu_T_val)\n        mu_S = np.log(mu_S_val)\n\n        # --- Metric 1: R1 = P(HQ > 1) ---\n        # D1 = ln(E) - ln(T)\n        mu_D1 = mu_E - mu_T\n        var_D1 = sigma_E**2 + sigma_T**2 - 2 * rho_ET * sigma_E * sigma_T\n        \n        # Check for boundary (degenerate) case\n        if var_D1 < ZERO_TOLERANCE:\n            # D1 is a constant mu_D1.
