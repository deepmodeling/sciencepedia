We seek a positive coexistence equilibrium, so we assume $B>0$ and $Z>0$.\n\nThe steady-state conditions ($\\frac{dB}{dt}=0$ and $\\frac{dZ}{dt}=0$) for a fixed ambient nitrogen concentration $N$ define the nullclines in the $(B,Z)$ plane.\n\nFrom $\\frac{dB}{dt}=0$, we obtain the phytoplankton nullcline (or $B$-isocline):\n$$ (\\mu(N)-D-m_B)B - g(B)Z = 0 $$\n$$ Z = \\frac{(\\mu(N)-D-m_B)B}{g(B)} $$\nSubstituting $g(B) = g_{\\max}B/(K_g+B)$, we get:\n$$ Z_B(B) = \\frac{(\\mu(N)-D-m_B)B}{g_{\\max}B/(K_g+B)} = \\frac{\\mu(N)-D-m_B}{g_{\\max}}(K_g+B) $$\nThis expression defines $Z$ as a linear function of $B$ for a fixed $N$.\n\nFrom $\\frac{dZ}{dt}=0$ with $Z>0$, we obtain the zooplankton nullcline (or $Z$-isocline):\n$$ e\\,g(B) - D - m_Z - aZ = 0 $$\n$$ Z_Z(B) = \\frac{e\\,g(B) - D - m_Z}{a} = \\frac{1}{a}\\left(e\\frac{g_{\\max}B}{K_g+B} - D - m_Z\\right) $$\nThis expression defines $Z$ as a saturating (Michaelis-Menten type) function of $B$.\n\nThe saddle-node bifurcation occurs at the point $(B_{SN}, Z_{SN})$ where these two nullclines are tangent. This implies two conditions must be met simultaneously:\n1.  The nullclines intersect: $Z_B(B_{SN}) = Z_Z(B_{SN})$\n2.  The slopes of the nullclines are equal: $\\frac{dZ_B}{dB}\\bigg|_{B=B_{SN}} = \\frac{dZ_Z}{dB}\\bigg|_{B=B_{SN}}$\n\nFirst, we compute the derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{dZ_B}{dB} = \\frac{\\mu(N)-D-m_B}{g_{\\max}} $$\n$$ \\frac{dZ_Z}{dB} = \\frac{d}{dB}\\left[\\frac{1}{a}\\left(e\\frac{g_{\\max}B}{K_g+B} - D - m_Z\\right)\\right] = \\frac{e g_{\\max}}{a} \\frac{d}{dB}\\left(\\frac{B}{K_g+B}\\right) = \\frac{e g_{\\max}}{a}\\frac{K_g}{(K_g+B)^2} $$\n\nEquating the derivatives gives us a relationship between $N$ and $B_{SN}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mu(N)-D-m_B}{g_{\\max}} = \\frac{e g_{\\max} K_g}{a(K_g+B_{SN})^2} $$\n$$ \\mu(N)-D-m_B = \\frac{e g_{\\max}^2 K_g}{a(K_g+B_{SN})^2} \\quad (*)$$\n\nNow we use the intersection condition, $Z_B(B_{SN}) = Z_Z(B_{SN})$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mu(N)-D-m_B}{g_{\\max}}(K_g+B_{SN}) = \\frac{1}{a}\\left(e\\frac{g_{\\max}B_{SN}}{K_g+B_{SN}} - (D+m_Z)\\right) $$\nSubstitute the expression for $\\mu(N)-D-m_B$ from equation $(*)$ into the intersection condition:\n$$ \\frac{1}{g_{\\max}}\\left(\\frac{e g_{\\max}^2 K_g}{a(K_g+B_{SN})^2}\\right)(K_g+B_{SN}) = \\frac{1}{a}\\left(e\\frac{g_{\\max}B_{SN}}{K_g+B_{SN}} - (D+m_Z)\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{e g_{\\max} K_g}{a(K_g+B_{SN})} = \\frac{1}{a}\\left(e\\frac{g_{\\max}B_{SN}}{K_g+B_{SN}} - (D+m_Z)\\right) $$\nMultiplying by $a$ and by $(K_g+B_{SN})$:\n$$ e g_{\\max} K_g = e g_{\\max} B_{SN} - (D+m_Z)(K_g+B_{SN}) $$\n$$ e g_{\\max} K_g = e g_{\\max} B_{SN} - (D+m_Z)K_g - (D+m_Z)B_{SN} $$\nRearranging to solve for $B_{SN}$:\n$$ (e g_{\\max} + D+m_Z)K_g = (e g_{\\max} - (D+m_Z))B_{SN} $$\n$$ B_{SN} = K_g \\frac{e g_{\\max} + D+m_Z}{e g_{\\max} - (D+m_Z)} $$\nNow, we substitute the parameter values to find the numerical value of $B_{SN}$:\n$e = 0.3$, $g_{\\max} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{d^{-1}}$, so $e g_{\\max} = 0.3 \\times 1.2 = 0.36\\,\\mathrm{d^{-1}}$.\n$D = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{d^{-1}}$, $m_Z = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{d^{-1}}$, so $D+m_Z = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{d^{-1}}$.\n$K_g = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,C\\,L^{-1}}$.\n$$ B_{SN} = 0.6 \\times \\frac{0.36 + 0.25}{0.36 - 0.25} = 0.6 \\times \\frac{0.61}{0.11} = 0.6 \\times \\frac{61}{11} = \\frac{36.6}{11} \\approx 3.3273\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,C\\,L^{-1}} $$\n\nNext, we find the phytoplankton growth rate $\\mu(N_{SN})$ at this bifurcation point using equation $(*)$:\n$$ \\mu(N_{SN}) = (D+m_B) + \\frac{e g_{\\max}^2 K_g}{a(K_g+B_{SN})^2} $$\n$D+m_B = 0.2+0.05 = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{d^{-1}}$.\n$a = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{(mg\\,C\\,L^{-1})^{-1}\\,d^{-1}}$.\n$K_g+B_{SN} = 0.6 + \\frac{36.6}{11} = \\frac{6.6+36.6}{11} = \\frac{43.2}{11}$.\nThe second term is:\n$$ \\frac{e g_{\\max}^2 K_g}{a(K_g+B_{SN})^2} = \\frac{0.3 \\times (1.2)^2 \\times 0.6}{0.4 \\times (\\frac{43.2}{11})^2} = \\frac{0.2592}{0.4 \\times \\frac{1866.24}{121}} = \\frac{0.2592 \\times 121}{0.4 \\times 1866.24} = \\frac{31.3632}{746.496} = 0.042\\,\\mathrm{d^{-1}} $$\nSo, $\\mu(N_{SN}) = 0.25 + 0.042 = 0.292\\,\\mathrm{d^{-1}}$.\n\nNow we solve for the ambient nitrogen concentration $N_{SN}$ using the Monod function:\n$$ \\mu(N_{SN}) = \\mu_{\\max} \\frac{N_{SN}}{K_N+N_{SN}} $$\n$$ 0.292 = 1.4 \\frac{N_{SN}}{0.3+N_{SN}} $$\n$$ 0.292(0.3+N_{SN}) = 1.4 N_{SN} $$\n$$ 0.0876 + 0.292 N_{SN} = 1.4 N_{SN} $$\n$$ 0.0876 = (1.4 - 0.292)N_{SN} = 1.108 N_{SN} $$\n$$ N_{SN} = \\frac{0.0876}{1.108} \\approx 0.079061\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,N\\,L^{-1}} $$\n\nFinally, we use the steady-state equation for nitrogen to find the required input concentration $N_{\\mathrm{in}}^{\\mathrm{SN}}$:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = 0 \\implies D(N_{\\mathrm{in}}^{\\mathrm{SN}}-N_{SN}) - \\frac{\\mu(N_{SN})}{y}B_{SN} = 0 $$\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{in}}^{\\mathrm{SN}} = N_{SN} + \\frac{\\mu(N_{SN}) B_{SN}}{D y} $$\nSubstituting the values we have computed:\n$N_{SN} \\approx 0.079061$, $\\mu(N_{SN}) = 0.292$, $B_{SN} = \\frac{36.6}{11}$, $D=0.2$, $y=4$.\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{in}}^{\\mathrm{SN}} \\approx 0.079061 + \\frac{0.292 \\times \\frac{36.6}{11}}{0.2 \\times 4} $$\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{in}}^{\\mathrm{SN}} \\approx 0.079061 + \\frac{0.292 \\times 3.32727}{0.8} \\approx 0.079061 + \\frac{0.97153}{0.8} $$\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{in}}^{\\mathrm{SN}} \\approx 0.079061 + 1.21441 \\approx 1.29347\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,N\\,L^{-1}} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as requested.\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{in}}^{\\mathrm{SN}} \\approx 1.293\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,N\\,L^{-1}} $$\nLet me recompute with higher precision.\n$B_{SN} = 36.6/11$. $\\mu(N_{SN}) = 0.292$. $N_{SN} = 0.0876/1.108$.\n$N_{\\mathrm{in}}^{\\mathrm{SN}} = \\frac{0.0876}{1.108} + \\frac{0.292 \\times (36.6/11)}{0.2 \\times 4} = \\frac{0.0876}{1.108} + \\frac{10.6872 / 11}{0.8} = \\frac{0.0876}{1.108} + \\frac{10.6872}{8.8} \\approx 0.07906137 + 1.21445455 \\approx 1.29351592\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,N\\,L^{-1}}$.\nRounding to four significant figures gives $1.294$.
