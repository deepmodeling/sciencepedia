The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and definitions for a unique and meaningful solution. The language is objective and precise.\n\nThe system describes the dynamics of infectious individuals in two coupled populations: humans ($H$) and animals ($A$). Let $I_H$ and $I_A$ be the number of infectious individuals in the human and animal populations, respectively. The dynamics of these infectious compartments, linearized around the disease-free equilibrium (DFE), are central to the NGM method. At the DFE, it is assumed that the total populations are large and constant, and nearly all individuals are susceptible.\n\nThe rate of change for each infectious compartment is given by the rate of new infections minus the rate of removal (recovery or death).

This indicates that at the start of the outbreak, for every $\\approx 0.43$ new cases in humans, there is $1$ new case in animals. The animal population bears a larger burden of new infections.\n\nTo determine which pathway sustains transmission, we examine how these new infections are generated. The total number of next-generation infections is given by $K v$. The source of these infections is the initial distribution of cases, which is also proportional to $v$. We can decompose the new infections by their source and recipient population. Let the normalized eigenvector be $v = [0.430, 1]^T$.\n- Total secondary infections from humans (proportional to $v_H$):\n  - To humans ($H \\to H$): $K_{HH} v_H = 1.5 \\times 0.430 = 0.645$\n  - To animals ($H \\to A$): $K_{AH} v_H = 1.0 \\times 0.430 = 0.430$\n- Total secondary infections from animals (proportional to $v_A$):\n  - To humans ($A \\to H$): $K_{HA} v_A = 0.4 \\times 1 = 0.400$\n  - To animals ($A \\to A$): $K_{AA} v_A = 2.0 \\times 1 = 2.000$\n\nComparing the contributions of the different transmission pathways to the production of new cases:\n- Within-human ($H \\to H$): relative contribution of $0.645$.\n- Within-animal ($A \\to A$): relative contribution of $2.000$.\n- Cross-species ($H \\leftrightarrow A$): total relative contribution of $0.430 + 0.400 = 0.830$.\n\nThe within-animal transmission pathway ($A \\to A$) is responsible for the largest proportion of new infections during the exponential growth phase. Its contribution ($2.000$) is substantially larger than that of the within-human pathway ($0.645$) and the combined cross-species pathways ($0.830$). Therefore, transmission within the animal population is the dominant pathway sustaining the epidemic. This is consistent with the fact that the intra-animal reproduction number, $K_{AA} = 2.0$, is the largest element of the NGM, and the dominant eigenvector is heavily weighted towards the animal population.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.430}$$", "id": "2515610"}, {"introduction": "Once we understand how a pathogen might spread, the next critical step is detecting its presence across the human-animal-environment interface.

The model assumptions (large population, independent Bernoulli trials) are appropriate and common for this type of analysis.

All necessary data are provided, and there are no internal contradictions. The language is objective and precise. The problem is not trivial, as it requires derivation from first principles and subsequent calculation. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\nThe problem is to determine the sample sizes $(n_{\\mathrm{H}}, n_{\\mathrm{L}}, n_{\\mathrm{W}})$ that minimize the total cost, subject to stratum-specific constraints on detection probability. The optimization problem is separable, meaning we can determine the minimum required sample size for each stratum independently.\n\nLet us consider a single stratum $i$. For a randomly selected individual from this stratum, two independent events must occur for it to be counted as a detected positive case: the individual must be infected (with probability $p_i$), and the diagnostic test must return a positive result (with conditional probability $\\sigma_i$). The probability of a single randomly sampled individual being both infected and testing positive is the product of these probabilities, which we define as the effective per-individual detection probability, $\\pi_i$.\n$$ \\pi_i = p_i \\sigma_i $$\nThe complementary event, that a single sampled individual is *not* detected as a positive case, has probability $1 - \\pi_i$. This occurs if the individual is not infected (probability $1-p_i$) or if the individual is infected but the test fails (probability $p_i(1-\\sigma_i)$). The total probability is $(1-p_i) + p_i(1-\\sigma_i) = 1 - p_i\\sigma_i = 1 - \\pi_i$.\n\nGiven that we collect a sample of $n_i$ individuals, and assuming independence between individuals (justified by the large population assumption), the probability of *not* detecting any positive case in the entire sample is the probability that all $n_i$ independent trials result in non-detection. This probability is $(1-\\pi_i)^{n_i}$.\n\nThe probability of detecting at least one positive case in the sample is the complement of this event:\n$$ P(\\text{detection in stratum } i) = 1 - (1 - \\pi_i)^{n_i} = 1 - (1 - p_i \\sigma_i)^{n_i} $$\nThe problem requires this probability to be at least $\\beta_i$:\n$$ 1 - (1 - p_i \\sigma_i)^{n_i} \\ge \\beta_i $$\nWe must now solve this inequality for the integer sample size $n_i$.\n$$ 1 - \\beta_i \\ge (1 - p_i \\sigma_i)^{n_i} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides is permissible as both sides are positive quantities less than $1$.\n$$ \\ln(1 - \\beta_i) \\ge \\ln\\left((1 - p_i \\sigma_i)^{n_i}\\right) $$\n$$ \\ln(1 - \\beta_i) \\ge n_i \\ln(1 - p_i \\sigma_i) $$\nTo isolate $n_i$, we divide by $\\ln(1 - p_i \\sigma_i)$. Since $p_i > 0$ and $\\sigma_i > 0$, it follows that $0 < p_i \\sigma_i < 1$, which implies that $\\ln(1 - p_i \\sigma_i)$ is a negative number. Division by a negative number reverses the inequality sign:\n$$ n_i \\ge \\frac{\\ln(1 - \\beta_i)}{\\ln(1 - p_i \\sigma_i)} $$\nSince $n_i$ must be an integer, the minimum required sample size for stratum $i$, which we denote as $n_i^*$, is the smallest integer satisfying this condition. This is given by the ceiling function:\n$$ n_i^* = \\left\\lceil \\frac{\\ln(1 - \\beta_i)}{\\ln(1 - p_i \\sigma_i)} \\right\\rceil $$\nThe objective is to minimize the total cost $C = \\sum_i c_i n_i$. Since all costs $c_i$ are positive, the total cost $C$ is a monotonically increasing function of each $n_i$. To minimize $C$, we must select the smallest possible integer value for each $n_i$ that satisfies its respective constraint.

The problem is free of scientific unsoundness, ambiguity, and contradictions. It is a formalizable problem directly relevant to the stated field.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the first principles of probability. Let $I$ be the event that infection occurs. The problem states that infection occurs if at least one pathogen organism successfully initiates it. Let $N$ be the random variable representing the number of pathogens ingested, where $N \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(d)$. The probability mass function for $N$ is given by:\n$$P(N=k) = \\frac{d^k \\exp(-d)}{k!}$$\nfor $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n\nIt is more direct to calculate the probability of the complementary event, $I^c$, which is the event that no infection occurs. The event $I^c$ happens if and only if all $N$ ingested organisms fail to initiate infection. We can find the unconditional probability $P(I^c)$ by applying the law of total probability, conditioning on the number of ingested pathogens, $N=k$:\n$$P(I^c) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} P(I^c | N=k) P(N=k)$$\n\nLet us analyze the conditional probability term, $P(I^c | N=k)$. This is the probability of no infection given that exactly $k$ organisms were ingested. The probability that a single organism successfully initiates infection is $r$. Therefore, the probability that a single organism *fails* to initiate infection is $(1-r)$. Since the problem states that the $k$ organisms act independently, the probability that all $k$ of them fail to initiate infection is the product of their individual failure probabilities:\n$$P(I^c | N=k) = (1-r)^k$$\n\nNow, we substitute this conditional probability and the Poisson probability mass function back into the summation for $P(I^c)$:\n$$P(I^c) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (1-r)^k \\frac{d^k \\exp(-d)}{k!}$$\n\nWe can factor out the term $\\exp(-d)$ from the summation, as it does not depend on the index $k$:\n$$P(I^c) = \\exp(-d) \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{((1-r)d)^k}{k!}$$\n\nThe summation term is the Taylor series expansion for the exponential function, $\\exp(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^k}{k!}$. In this case, the argument is $x = (1-r)d$. Therefore, the sum is equal to $\\exp((1-r)d)$.\n$$P(I^c) = \\exp(-d) \\exp((1-r)d)$$\n\nUsing the property of exponents, $\\exp(a)\\exp(b) = \\exp(a+b)$, we can simplify the expression:\n$$P(I^c) = \\exp(-d + (1-r)d) = \\exp(-d + d - rd) = \\exp(-rd)$$\n\nThe probability of infection, $P_I$, is the complement of the probability of no infection, $P(I^c)$:\n$$P_I = P(I) = 1 - P(I^c) = 1 - \\exp(-rd)$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression for the infection probability, known as the exponential dose-response model.\n\nThe minimal set of modeling assumptions required for this derivation and their mechanistic interpretations are as follows:\n$1$. **Poisson Distribution of Pathogens:** The number of pathogen organisms, $N$, in an ingested volume follows a Poisson distribution with mean $d$. Mechanistically, this assumes that the pathogens are distributed randomly and independently throughout the environmental medium (e.g., water). This implies a state of complete mixing and that the concentration of pathogens is low enough that the probability of finding an organism in any small volume is small and constant.\n\n$2$. **Independent Action:** The success or failure of any single pathogen organism to initiate infection is independent of the success or failure of all other co-ingested organisms. Mechanistically, this implies that the pathogens do not exhibit cooperative (synergistic) or inhibitory (antagonistic) interactions during the initial host invasion and infection establishment phases.\n\n$3$. **Constant Infectivity ($r$):** Every pathogen organism has the same, constant probability $r$ of initiating infection. This assumes that the pathogen population is genetically and phenotypically homogeneous with respect to virulence, and that host susceptibility is constant for any given exposure event. It abstracts away variations in pathogen fitness and host immune status.\n\n$4$. **Single-Hit Sufficiency:** The successful action of just one pathogen organism is sufficient to cause infection in the host. This implies there is no dose threshold for the number of successful \"hits\" needed to cause the defined outcome of \"infection.\" This is a fundamental tenet of the single-hit model class.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1 - \\exp(-rd)}\n$$", "id": "2515679"}]}
