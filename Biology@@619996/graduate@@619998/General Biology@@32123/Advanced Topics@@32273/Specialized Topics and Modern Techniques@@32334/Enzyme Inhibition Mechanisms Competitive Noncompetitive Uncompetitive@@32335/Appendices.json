The question asks for a derivation from first principles followed by a calculation, which is a standard, non-trivial exercise.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Rate Equation**\n\nThe initial rate of reaction, $v$, is defined by the rate of product formation. According to the reaction scheme, product $P$ is formed from the enzyme-substrate complex $ES$ with a catalytic rate constant $k_{cat}$.\n$$v = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{cat} [ES]$$\nThe maximal velocity, $V_{\\max}$, is achieved when the enzyme is fully saturated with substrate, such that $[ES] \\approx [E]_{T}$. Thus, we define $V_{\\max}$ as:\n$$V_{\\max} = k_{cat} [E]_{T}$$\nThis allows us to express the initial rate $v$ in terms of $V_{\\max}$:\n$$v = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{[E]_{T}} [ES]$$\nTo proceed, we must find an expression for the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex, $[ES]$. We apply the quasi-steady-state assumption (QSSA) to the $ES$ complex, meaning its concentration is assumed to be constant over the initial period of the reaction. The rate of change of $[ES]$ is the rate of its formation minus the rate of its breakdown.\n$$\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_{1}[E][S] - (k_{-1} + k_{cat})[ES] = 0$$\nwhere $k_{1}$ and $k_{-1}$ are the forward and reverse rate constants for substrate binding, respectively. Rearranging this gives:\n$$k_{1}[E][S] = (k_{-1} + k_{cat})[ES]$$\nBy the Briggs–Haldane definition, the Michaelis constant $K_{M}$ is:\n$$K_{M} = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{cat}}{k_{1}}$$\nSubstituting $K_{M}$ into the steady-state equation yields:\n$$K_{M}[ES] = [E][S]$$\nThis equation relates the concentration of free enzyme $[E]$ to the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex $[ES]$.\n\nNext, we use the rapid equilibrium assumption for the binding of the inhibitor $I$ to the free enzyme $E$. The inhibitor dissociation constant, $K_{i}$, is given by:\n$$K_{i} = \\frac{[E][I]}{[EI]}$$\nThis can be rearranged to express the concentration of the enzyme-inhibitor complex, $[EI]$, in terms of $[E]$:\n$$[EI] = \\frac{[E][I]}{K_{i}}$$\nThe total enzyme concentration, $[E]_{T}$, is conserved, as given:\n$$[E]_{T} = [E] + [ES] + [EI]$$\nWe now substitute the expressions for $[E]$ (from the QSSA result) and $[EI]$ (from the inhibitor equilibrium) into the conservation equation. First, we express $[E]$ in terms of $[ES]$:\n$$[E] = \\frac{K_{M}[ES]}{[S]}$$\nNow, we substitute this into the expression for $[EI]$:\n$$[EI] = \\frac{1}{K_{i}} \\left( \\frac{K_{M}[ES]}{[S]} \\right) [I] = \\frac{K_{M}[I]}{K_{i}[S]}[ES]$$\nSubstituting both expressions for $[E]$ and $[EI]$ into the conservation equation gives:\n$$[E]_{T} = \\frac{K_{M}[ES]}{[S]} + [ES] + \\frac{K_{M}[I]}{K_{i}[S]}[ES]$$\nWe can factor out $[ES]$ from the right-hand side:\n$$[E]_{T} = [ES] \\left( \\frac{K_{M}}{[S]} + 1 + \\frac{K_{M}[I]}{K_{i}[S]} \\right)$$\nRearranging the term in the parenthesis gives:\n$$[E]_{T} = [ES] \\left( \\frac{K_{M} + [S] + \\frac{K_{M}[I]}{K_{i}}}{[S]} \\right)$$\n$$[E]_{T} = [ES] \\left( \\frac{K_{M}\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{i}}\\right) + [S]}{[S]} \\right)$$\nNow, we can solve for $[ES]$:\n$$[ES] = \\frac{[E]_{T}[S]}{K_{M}\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{i}}\\right) + [S]}$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $[ES]$ into the initial rate equation, $v = k_{cat}[ES] = \\frac{V_{max}}{[E]_{T}}[ES]$:\n$$v = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{[E]_{T}} \\left( \\frac{[E]_{T}[S]}{K_{M}\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{i}}\\right) + [S]} \\right)$$\nThe $[E]_{T}$ terms cancel, yielding the derived rate equation for competitive inhibition:\n$$v = \\frac{V_{\\max}[S]}{K_{M}\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{i}}\\right) + [S]}$$\nThis is the required expression for the initial rate $v$.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following parameter values:\n- $V_{\\max} = 1\\ \\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$\n- $K_{M} = 50\\ \\mu\\text{M}$\n- $K_{i} = 5\\ \\mu\\text{M}$\n- $[I] = 10\\ \\mu\\text{M}$\n- $[S] = 25\\ \\mu\\text{M}$\n\nThe value for $[E]_{T}$ is not required for the calculation since $V_{\\max}$ is provided directly.

Thus, the correct expression is:\n$$[\\mathrm{EI}] = \\frac{([\\mathrm{E}]_T + [\\mathrm{I}]_T + K_i) - \\sqrt{([\\mathrm{E}]_T + [\\mathrm{I}]_T + K_i)^2 - 4[\\mathrm{E}]_T [\\mathrm{I}]_T}}{2}$$\nThe fraction of enzyme bound, $f$, is defined as $f = \\frac{[\\mathrm{EI}]}{[\\mathrm{E}]_T}$. Substituting the expression for $[\\mathrm{EI}]$ gives the derived expression for $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{([\\mathrm{E}]_T + [\\mathrm{I}]_T + K_i) - \\sqrt{([\\mathrm{E}]_T + [\\mathrm{I}]_T + K_i)^2 - 4[\\mathrm{E}]_T [\\mathrm{I}]_T}}{2[\\mathrm{E}]_T}$$\nNow, we evaluate $f$ using the provided numerical values: $[\\mathrm{E}]_T = 50\\ \\text{nM}$, $[\\mathrm{I}]_T = 30\\ \\text{nM}$, and $K_i = 10\\ \\text{nM}$. We can omit the units during calculation as they are consistent.\nFirst, we calculate the terms in the expression:\nThe sum term: $[\\mathrm{E}]_T + [\\mathrm{I}]_T + K_i = 50 + 30 + 10 = 90$.\nThe product term for the discriminant: $4[\\mathrm{E}]_T [\\mathrm{I}]_T = 4 \\times 50 \\times 30 = 6000$.\nThe discriminant is $(90)^2 - 6000 = 8100 - 6000 = 2100$.\nThe square root of the discriminant is $\\sqrt{2100}$.\n\nNow we compute $[\\mathrm{EI}]$:\n$$[\\mathrm{EI}] = \\frac{90 - \\sqrt{2100}}{2} \\approx \\frac{90 - 45.825757}{2} = \\frac{44.174243}{2} \\approx 22.087122\\ \\text{nM}$$\nThen, we calculate the fraction bound, $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{[\\mathrm{EI}]}{[\\mathrm{E}]_T} \\approx \\frac{22.087122}{50} \\approx 0.441742$$\nNext, we compute the naive occupancy estimate, $f_{\\text{naive}}$, which incorrectly assumes that the free inhibitor concentration $[\\mathrm{I}]$ is approximately equal to the total inhibitor concentration $[\\mathrm{I}]_T$:\n$$f_{\\text{naive}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{I}]_T}{K_i + [\\mathrm{I}]_T} = \\frac{30}{10 + 30} = \\frac{30}{40} = 0.75$$\nFinally, we compute the absolute deviation $\\Delta = \\left| f - f_{\\text{naive}} \\right|$:\n$$\\Delta = |0.441742 - 0.75| = |-0.308258| = 0.308258$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives $\\Delta = 0.3083$. This significant deviation underscores the failure of the naive model when inhibitor depletion is substantial, as is the case in the tight-binding regime.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3083}$$", "id": "2796875"}]}
