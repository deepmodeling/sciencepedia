For a set of $N$ discrete atoms in the unit cell, it is defined as the sum of the scattering contributions from each atom:\n$$\nF(hkl) = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} f_{j,\\text{eff}} \\exp[2\\pi i (hx_j + ky_j + lz_j)]\n$$\nwhere $(x_j, y_j, z_j)$ are the fractional coordinates of atom $j$. The space group is $P1$, which has only the identity symmetry operation. Therefore, the asymmetric unit constitutes the entire contents of the unit cell, and the sum is over the three specified atoms ($N=3$).\n\nThe effective atomic scattering factor, $f_{j,\\text{eff}}$, for each atom must account for its partial occupancy $o_j$ and its thermal vibration, described by the isotropic B-factor $B_j$.

The calculation of electron density will be based solely on these given terms. The term for $h=k=l=0$, $F_{000}$, which represents the total number of electrons in the unit cell and contributes to the average electron density, is not given.

The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem dictates the required grid spacing to avoid aliasing, where high-frequency information corrupts low-frequency components. The highest frequency present in the data along a particular axis (e.g., the $a$ axis) is determined by the maximum Miller index, $h_{max}$. The corresponding spatial frequency is $f_{max} = h_{max}/a$. To unambiguously represent this frequency, the sampling frequency $f_s$ must be greater than twice $f_{max}$. In terms of the number of grid points $N_a$ along the $a$ axis, the sampling frequency is $f_s = N_a/a$. Thus, the condition is $N_a/a > 2(h_{max}/a)$, which simplifies to $N_a > 2h_{max}$. If this condition is violated (i.e., the real-space grid is too coarse), high-frequency details from the electron density map will wrap around and distort the map at lower frequencies. This requires careful selection of the FFT grid dimensions based on the resolution limit of the diffraction data. A commonly used rule of thumb to also account for features in the Patterson map is to sample at $N_a > 4h_{max}$.\n\n2.  **FFT Algorithm Efficiency and Zero-Padding**: The computational efficiency of the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm is highly dependent on the prime factorization of the number of grid points in each dimension ($N_a, N_b, N_c$). The algorithm is fastest when these numbers are powers of two (Cooley-Tukey FFT) or are highly composite (having small prime factors). The minimal grid size dictated by the sampling theorem ($N_a > 2h_{max}$, etc.) might be a large prime number, rendering the FFT computationally inefficient. To overcome this, the array of structure factors is often \"padded\" with zeros to expand its dimensions to a nearby, highly composite number. For example, if $2h_{max} + 1 = 127$, one might embed the data in a $128 \\times 128 \\times 128$ grid ($128=2^7$). This practice, known as zero-padding, serves two purposes: it ensures computational speed by allowing the use of an efficient FFT routine, and it effectively interpolates the electron density map in real space (a form of sinc interpolation), yielding a smoother and more finely gridded map without adding any new high-resolution information.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-0.1383}\n$$", "id": "2839279"}, {"introduction": "This final practice moves from fundamental calculations to the critical evaluation of a modern cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction [@problem_id:2839290].

Near the central axis (radius $< 20\\,\\text{\\AA}$), $r \\approx 0.95$; at the periphery (radius $\\approx 80\\,\\text{\\AA}$), $r \\approx 0.55$.\n- A directional FSC analysis shows systematically higher correlation along cones aligned with the imposed $C_6$ axis than in directions perpendicular to that axis.\n\nFrom first principles, analyze the effect of imposing an incorrect symmetry and propose appropriate diagnostics using the information above. Which of the following statements are justified by the observations and the foundational base?\n\nA. The discrepancy between the global half-map FSC and the asymmetric-unit map–model FSC against the independent half-map is consistent with an overly high imposed symmetry; refining the model against one half-map and validating against the other within an asymmetric-unit mask is an appropriate diagnostic of incorrect symmetry and overfitting.\n\nB. The high local correlation near the axis and low correlation at the periphery under a $60^{\\circ}$ rotation primarily indicate beam-induced motion artifacts; if the symmetry were incorrect, the correlation would be uniformly low at all radii.\n\nC. If the imposed symmetry is incorrect, the directional FSC becomes isotropic because averaging with wrong symmetry randomizes directional dependencies; thus, anisotropy of the directional FSC contradicts symmetry misassignment.\n\nD. A practical validation is to reprocess without symmetry or with lower symmetry (for example, $C_3$) and repeat cross-validated map–model FSC analyses; an improvement of the asymmetric-unit map–model FSC against the free half-map at high resolution, together with disappearance of symmetry-periodic spikes in the whole-oligomer FSC, would support that the original $C_6$ imposition was inappropriate.\n\nE. In X-ray crystallography, assigning a higher-symmetry space group than the true one generally lowers the cross-validated free R-factor (R-free) due to increased redundancy; therefore, a low R-free alongside strong non-crystallographic symmetry peaks in the Patterson map supports the higher-symmetry assignment.\n\nSelect all that apply.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation prior to any attempt at a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **System:** Single-particle Cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction of a ring-like assembly.\n- **Symmetry Imposition:** Cyclic symmetry $C_6$ was enforced from the outset.\n- **Hypothesis:** The object is a homo-oligomer, but with possible subtle subunit heterogeneity.\n- **Foundational Facts:**\n    - (i) A true symmetry operation leaves the density invariant.\n    - (ii) Enforced symmetry averages signal and noise.\n    - (iii) Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) is a normalized cross-correlation of Fourier coefficients between two maps with independent noise.\n    - (iv) Map–model FSC between an experimental map and a model map tests for overfitting when a model refined against a 'work' half-map is validated against a 'free' half-map.\n    - (v) Directional FSC probes anisotropy of resolution.\n    - (vi) A real-space symmetry validation test measures local correlation between a map and its rotated copy.\n- **Observations:**\n    - 1.

Directional FSC analysis shows higher correlation along the imposed $C_6$ axis than perpendicular to it.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem describes a realistic scenario in structural biology, specifically in the validation of a cryo-EM reconstruction. All provided terms (cryo-EM, $C_6$ symmetry, FSC, half-maps, map-model FSC, directional FSC, real-space symmetry validation) are standard concepts and tools in the field. The numerical values presented are plausible. The set of observations collectively forms a coherent, though challenging, diagnostic puzzle. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived based on the provided information.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\nThe core issue is to determine whether the imposed $C_6$ symmetry is correct, given the set of observations. Incorrect symmetry imposition, particularly imposing a higher symmetry than is truly present, leads to a number of predictable artifacts. The process averages non-equivalent subunits, which blurs genuine structural differences and can artificially inflate measures of resolution while simultaneously introducing systematic errors.\n\n1.  **Interpretation of Observation 1 (Half-map FSC):** The $2.8\\,\\text{\\AA}$ resolution from the global half-map FSC indicates that the *symmetrized* maps are consistent with each other to this resolution. However, forcing symmetry can make noise patterns consistent between half-maps, leading to an artificially high FSC value. This number, by itself, is not a reliable indicator of the true resolution of the individual asymmetric units if the symmetry is incorrect.\n\n2.  **Interpretation of Observation 2 (Map–model FSC):** This is a critical piece of evidence. An atomic model, which has perfect $C_6$ symmetry by constraint, is refined against the \"work\" half-map. The refinement process will optimize the model to fit not only the signal in the work map but also its specific noise realization, a phenomenon known as overfitting. The validation of this model against the \"free\" half-map, which has independent noise, is the crucial test. The map–model FSC for a single protomer drops from $\\approx 2.8\\,\\text{\\AA}$ (against the work map) to $\\approx 3.8\\,\\text{\\AA}$ (against the free map). This significant discrepancy indicates that the high-resolution features (in the $2.8\\,\\text{\\AA}$ to $3.8\\,\\text{\\AA}$ range) of the model are not supported by independent data. They are artifacts of overfitting, a problem severely exacerbated when a symmetric model is forced to fit an object whose underlying structure is not truly symmetric.\n\n3.  **Interpretation of Observation 3 (FSC Spikes):** The process of enforcing $C_N$ symmetry in real space is equivalent to specific operations in Fourier space. It artificially boosts the power spectrum at angular frequencies that are multiples of the symmetry angle ($360^{\\circ}/N$). For $C_6$, this corresponds to $60^{\\circ}$. The appearance of narrow spikes in the FSC at these specific periodicities is a classic hallmark of symmetry-imposition artifacts.\n\n4.  **Interpretation of Observation 4 (Real-space Correlation):** For a truly $C_6$ symmetric object, the local correlation $r$ after a $60^{\\circ}$ rotation should be $r=1.0$ everywhere. The observation that $r$ is high ($\\approx 0.95$) near the axis of rotation but low ($\\approx 0.55$) at the periphery is direct evidence that the symmetry is broken. The peripheral domains of the subunits are not related by a simple $60^{\\circ}$ rotation. This suggests either that the true symmetry is lower (e.g., $C_3$ or $C_2$, where only a subset of subunits are identical) or that there is conformational heterogeneity among the subunits.\n\n5.  **Interpretation of Observation 5 (Directional FSC):** Imposing symmetry on a dataset of randomly oriented particles inherently introduces anisotropy into the reconstruction. The signal along the symmetry axis is averaged over $N$ orientations (for $C_N$), which can significantly boost the signal-to-noise ratio in that direction compared to directions in the perpendicular plane. The observation of higher correlation (and thus higher resolution) along the $C_6$ axis is therefore an expected consequence of the symmetry-averaging process itself and is consistent with the possibility that this averaging is artificial.\n\n**Synthesis:** All observations consistently point to the conclusion that the imposed $C_6$ symmetry is incorrect for this complex, at least for its peripheral regions. The high overall resolution is likely an artifact, and the true structure is of lower symmetry or is heterogeneous.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The discrepancy between the global half-map FSC and the asymmetric-unit map–model FSC against the independent half-map is consistent with an overly high imposed symmetry; refining the model against one half-map and validating against the other within an asymmetric-unit mask is an appropriate diagnostic of incorrect symmetry and overfitting.**\nThis statement is a correct and precise summary of the situation. The large drop in resolution for the map–model FSC against the free half-map is the key indicator of overfitting, which is made worse by the incorrect symmetry assumption. The described procedure is a textbook method for diagnosing this exact problem.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The high local correlation near the axis and low correlation at the periphery under a $60^{\\circ}$ rotation primarily indicate beam-induced motion artifacts; if the symmetry were incorrect, the correlation would be uniformly low at all radii.**\nThis statement is flawed. First, while beam-induced motion can degrade peripheral features more, the primary and most direct interpretation of a radially-dependent symmetry correlation is a structural deviation from that symmetry. Second, the claim that incorrect symmetry would lead to uniformly low correlation is false. A complex can easily have a symmetric core and asymmetric peripheral domains, leading to exactly the observed pattern of high correlation near the center and low correlation at the periphery.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. If the imposed symmetry is incorrect, the directional FSC becomes isotropic because averaging with wrong symmetry randomizes directional dependencies; thus, anisotropy of the directional FSC contradicts symmetry misassignment.**\nThis statement presents inverted logic. Imposing any symmetry, correct or incorrect, introduces anisotropy by its very nature, preferentially strengthening the map along symmetry elements. Averaging with an incorrect symmetry does not randomize the map; it creates an artificially symmetric map. Therefore, the observed anisotropy is *expected* when symmetry is imposed and is consistent with, not contradictory to, a symmetry misassignment.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. A practical validation is to reprocess without symmetry or with lower symmetry (for example, $C_3$) and repeat cross-validated map–model FSC analyses; an improvement of the asymmetric-unit map–model FSC against the free half-map at high resolution, together with disappearance of symmetry-periodic spikes in the whole-oligomer FSC, would support that the original $C_6$ imposition was inappropriate.**\nThis statement describes the correct and logical next experimental step. If the true symmetry is lower than $C_6$, or if there is no symmetry ($C_1$), reprocessing with the correct (or no) symmetry should produce a more accurate map. This improved accuracy would manifest as a better fit of a properly built model, validated by a higher-resolution map–model FSC against the free half-map. Concurrently, removing the artificial $C_6$ constraint would eliminate the Fourier-space artifacts it caused. This is the standard procedure for confirming a symmetry misassignment.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. In X-ray crystallography, assigning a higher-symmetry space group than the true one generally lowers the cross-validated free R-factor (R-free) due to increased redundancy; therefore, a low R-free alongside strong non-crystallographic symmetry peaks in the Patterson map supports the higher-symmetry assignment.**\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds and inappropriately applies crystallographic concepts. First, in crystallography, imposing a higher symmetry than is true adds constraints that are inconsistent with the data. This will almost always *increase* (worsen) the R-free, not lower it. A lower R-free indicates a better model. Second, the problem is about cryo-EM, and while analogies exist, a direct transplant of crystallographic validation metrics and their interpretation is not appropriate. For instance, the concept of a Patterson map is used differently. This statement is fundamentally flawed in its crystallographic reasoning and irrelevant to the cryo-EM problem at hand.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2839290"}]}
