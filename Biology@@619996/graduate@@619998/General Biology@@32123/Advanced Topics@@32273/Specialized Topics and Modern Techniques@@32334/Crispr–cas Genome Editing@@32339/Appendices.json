The SpCas9 system and its $5'$-$\\mathrm{NGG}$-$3'$ PAM are cornerstones of modern molecular biology. The assumptions of a uniform and independent base distribution are standard simplifying assumptions for first-order estimations in bioinformatics, creating a well-defined probabilistic model. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary parameters provided for a unique solution. The terminology is precise and objective. There are no contradictions, no reliance on pseudoscience, and the question is entirely formalizable within the domain of probability theory and molecular biology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be formulated based on first principles.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe problem requires the calculation of the expected number of occurrences of the trinucleotide sequence $5'$-$\\mathrm{NGG}$-$3'$ in a double-stranded DNA genome of length $L$ base pairs.\n\nFirst, we establish the probabilities for each base. The assumption of a uniform base composition implies that the probability of finding any specific base at a given position is equal. Let $P(\\mathrm{A})$, $P(\\mathrm{T})$, $P(\\mathrm{C})$, and $P(\\mathrm{G})$ be the probabilities of observing Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, and Guanine, respectively.\n$$P(\\mathrm{A}) = P(\\mathrm{T}) = P(\\mathrm{C}) = P(\\mathrm{G}) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nThe PAM sequence is $5'$-$\\mathrm{NGG}$-$3'$. The 'N' denotes any of the four nucleobases. Therefore, the probability of 'N' at a position is:\n$$P(\\mathrm{N}) = P(\\mathrm{A}) + P(\\mathrm{T}) + P(\\mathrm{C}) + P(\\mathrm{G}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$$\nThe assumption of independent base choices allows us to calculate the probability of the sequence $5'$-$\\mathrm{NGG}$-$3'$ at any given starting position by multiplying the probabilities of the individual bases. Let this probability be $P_{PAM}$.\n$$P_{PAM} = P(\\mathrm{N}) \\times P(\\mathrm{G}) \\times P(\\mathrm{G}) = 1 \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}$$\n\nA single strand of the genome has a length of $L$ bases. A trinucleotide sequence can begin at any position $i$ from $i=1$ to $i=L-2$. Thus, there are $N_{sites} = L-2$ possible starting positions for a PAM sequence on a single strand.\n\nWe are interested in the expected number of PAMs. Let $X_i$ be an indicator random variable for a given strand, where $X_i=1$ if a PAM starts at position $i$ and $X_i=0$ otherwise. The expected value of $X_i$ is $E[X_i] = 1 \\cdot P(X_i=1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_i=0) = P_{PAM} = 1/16$.\n\nThe total number of PAMs on one strand, $N_{strand}$, is the sum of these indicator variables: $N_{strand} = \\sum_{i=1}^{L-2} X_i$. By the linearity of expectation, the expected number of PAMs on a single strand, $E_{strand}$, is:\n$$E_{strand} = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{L-2} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{L-2} E[X_i] = (L-2) \\times P_{PAM} = \\frac{L-2}{16}$$\n\nThe problem specifies that PAMs on both the forward and reverse strands are to be counted. The genome consists of two strands, each of length $L$. Under the given assumptions, the reverse strand is statistically identical to the forward strand regarding base composition and independence. Therefore, the expected number of PAMs on the reverse strand is also given by $E_{strand}$.\n\nThe total expected number of PAMs, $E_{total}$, is the sum of the expected numbers on the forward and reverse strands, as they are counted as distinct occurrences.\n$$E_{total} = E[\\text{PAMs on forward strand}] + E[\\text{PAMs on reverse strand}]$$\n$$E_{total} = \\frac{L-2}{16} + \\frac{L-2}{16} = 2 \\left( \\frac{L-2}{16} \\right)$$\nThe expression for the total expected number of PAMs is:\n$$E_{total} = \\frac{L-2}{8}$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the given genome length $L = 3.0 \\times 10^{9}$.\n$$E_{total} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{9} - 2}{8}$$\nGiven that $L$ is extremely large, the subtraction of $2$ is numerically insignificant and can be disregarded for an approximation.\n$$E_{total} \\approx \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{9}}{8} = 0.375 \\times 10^{9} = 3.75 \\times 10^{8}$$\nThis value is already provided to three significant figures.\n\n**Implications for Guide RNA Site Choice**\nThe calculation demonstrates that the expected number of $5'$-$\\mathrm{NGG}$-$3'$ PAMs is approximately $3.75 \\times 10^{8}$ in a genome of $3.0 \\times 10^{9}$ base pairs. This corresponds to a density of approximately one PAM for every $8$ base pairs when considering both strands ($E_{total} / L = (L/8)/L = 1/8$ PAMs per base pair).\n\nThis high density of PAMs has a dual effect on the utility of SpCas9 for genome editing:\n\n1.  **Enabling Factor**: The abundance of PAM sites is a significant advantage. It means that for almost any gene or genomic region of interest, a $5'$-$\\mathrm{NGG}$-$3'$ motif is likely to be found in close proximity. A typical guide RNA targets a $\\sim 20$ base pair sequence (the protospacer) immediately adjacent to the PAM. The high frequency of PAMs provides immense flexibility, ensuring that a suitable target site for SpCas9 is available near almost any desired location in the genome. It dramatically expands the addressable space for genome editing.\n\n2.  **Constraining Factor**: Despite the high density, the requirement for a PAM is absolute and sequence-specific. Targeting is not possible at any arbitrary sequence. One can only target sequences that are immediately upstream of an NGG motif. If, for instance, a specific single-nucleotide polymorphism needs to be corrected and there is no NGG motif in the correct position relative to it, standard SpCas9 cannot be used at that precise locus. Therefore, while the targeting landscape is vast, it is not continuous. The choice of guide RNA is fundamentally constrained by the discrete, albeit dense, distribution of PAM sequences.\n\nIn summary, the high density of the SpCas9 PAM enables broad targeting across the genome, but the strict sequence requirement imposes a critical local constraint on the exact site of cleavage.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.75 \\times 10^{8}}$$", "id": "2789658"}, {"introduction": "While potential PAM sites may be abundant, the true challenge of genome editing lies in specificity.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of an off-target score, $S$, defined as the relative cleavage likelihood of a mismatched site compared to the perfect on-target site. According to the principles of statistical thermodynamics, the likelihood, $L$, of a state is related to its free energy, $G$, by the Boltzmann factor. For a change in free energy, $\\Delta G$, relative to a reference state, the relative likelihood is given by:\n$$\nL_{\\text{relative}} \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nIn this context, the on-target site represents the reference state with zero mismatches, so its binding free energy penalty is $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{on-target}} = 0$. The off-target site has a total binding free energy penalty $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{off-target}}$.\n\nThe score $S$ is the ratio of the off-target likelihood to the on-target likelihood:\n$$\nS = \\frac{L_{\\text{off-target}}}{L_{\\text{on-target}}} = \\frac{k \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{off-target}}}{RT}\\right)}{k \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\text{on-target}}}{RT}\\right)}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality.

Therefore, a rigorous derivation of the solution is possible and will now be provided.\n\nLet $E_{\\mathrm{HDR}}$ be the event that a given double-strand break (DSB) is ultimately repaired by homology-directed repair (HDR). The objective is to compute the total probability of this event, $P(E_{\\mathrm{HDR}})$, which corresponds to the expected fraction of DSBs repaired by HDR across the entire asynchronous cell population.\n\nWe partition the problem based on the cell cycle phase in which the DSB occurs.
