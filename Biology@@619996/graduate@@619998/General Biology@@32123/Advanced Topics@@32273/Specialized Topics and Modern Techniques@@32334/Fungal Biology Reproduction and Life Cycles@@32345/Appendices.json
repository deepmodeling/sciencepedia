Mastering this calculation provides a foundational understanding of how genetic architecture influences population-level reproductive success.", "problem": "A basidiomycete fungus exhibits a tetrapolar (bifactorial) mating system governed by two unlinked mating-type loci, denoted $A$ and $B$. Each monokaryon is haploid and carries exactly one allele at locus $A$ and one allele at locus $B$. There are $n_{A}$ distinct alleles possible at locus $A$ and $n_{B}$ distinct alleles possible at locus $B$. Assume a very large, panmictic population in which each allele at a given locus is maintained at the same frequency by long-term balancing selection, and the two loci are unlinked so that alleles at $A$ and $B$ are in linkage equilibrium.

No units are required for the final answer.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a standard problem in population genetics that can be solved using fundamental principles of probability theory. All necessary information is provided. Therefore, the problem is valid and we may proceed with the derivation.\n\nLet $M_1$ and $M_2$ be two independently sampled monokaryons from the population. The mating type of a monokaryon is determined by its alleles at two unlinked loci, $A$ and $B$. Let the genotype of $M_1$ be $(A_i, B_k)$ and the genotype of $M_2$ be $(A_j, B_l)$, where $i, j \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n_A\\}$ and $k, l \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n_B\\}$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the two monokaryons are compatible if and only if they carry different alleles at *both* locus $A$ and locus $B$. This condition can be stated as $i \\neq j$ AND $k \\neq l$.\n\nLet $C$ be the event that $M_1$ and $M_2$ are compatible.\nLet $D_A$ be the event that the two monokaryons have different alleles at locus $A$ (i.e., $i \\neq j$).\nLet $D_B$ be the event that the two monokaryons have different alleles at locus $B$ (i.e., $k \\neq l$).\n\nThe condition for compatibility implies that the event $C$ is the intersection of events $D_A$ and $D_B$:\n$$C = D_A \\cap D_B$$\nThe problem states that the two loci, $A$ and $B$, are unlinked and in linkage equilibrium. A direct consequence of this assumption is that the events $D_A$ and $D_B$ are statistically independent. Therefore, the probability of compatibility, $P(C)$, is the product of the probabilities of these individual events:\n$$P(C) = P(D_A \\cap D_B) = P(D_A) P(D_B)$$\nOur task reduces to calculating $P(D_A)$ and $P(D_B)$. The logic is identical for both loci, so we will first derive $P(D_A)$.\n\nIt is more direct to first calculate the probability of the complementary event, $S_A$, which is the event that the two monokaryons have the *same* allele at locus $A$. The probability $P(D_A)$ is then given by:\n$$P(D_A) = 1 - P(S_A)$$\nThe problem states that there are $n_A$ distinct alleles at locus $A$, and that each allele is maintained at the same frequency. In a very large population, this means the frequency of any specific allele, say $A_i$, is $\\frac{1}{n_A}$. The probability of sampling a monokaryon with allele $A_i$ is therefore $P(A_i) = \\frac{1}{n_A}$.\n\nLet us consider the two independently sampled monokaryons, $M_1$ and $M_2$. The event $S_A$ occurs if both monokaryons carry the same allele $A_1$, OR the same allele $A_2$, ..., OR the same allele $A_{n_A}$. These are mutually exclusive events.\nThe probability that both $M_1$ and $M_2$ carry a specific allele $A_i$ is, due to independent sampling:\n$$P(M_1 \\text{ has } A_i \\text{ and } M_2 \\text{ has } A_i) = P(M_1 \\text{ has } A_i) \\times P(M_2 \\text{ has } A_i) = \\frac{1}{n_A} \\times \\frac{1}{n_A} = \\frac{1}{n_A^2}$$\nTo find the total probability of event $S_A$, we sum this probability over all possible alleles:\n$$P(S_A) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_A} P(\\text{both } M_1 \\text{ and } M_2 \\text{ have } A_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_A} \\frac{1}{n_A^2} = n_A \\times \\frac{1}{n_A^2} = \\frac{1}{n_A}$$\nAlternatively, one can reason as follows: sample the first monokaryon, $M_1$. It will possess some allele at locus $A$. The specific allele does not matter. The probability that the second, independently sampled monokaryon $M_2$ has the exact same allele is simply the frequency of that allele in the population, which is $\\frac{1}{n_A}$.\n\nNow we can calculate the probability of the two monokaryons having different alleles at locus $A$:\n$$P(D_A) = 1 - P(S_A) = 1 - \\frac{1}{n_A}$$\nBy identical reasoning for locus $B$, which has $n_B$ alleles each at a frequency of $\\frac{1}{n_B}$, the probability that two monokaryons have different alleles at locus $B$ is:\n$$P(D_B) = 1 - \\frac{1}{n_B}$$\nFinally, we substitute these back into the expression for the probability of compatibility $P(C)$, using the independence of the two loci:\n$$P(C) = P(D_A) P(D_B) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n_A}\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n_B}\\right)$$\nThis is the exact, closed-form expression for the probability that two independently sampled monokaryons are compatible under a tetrapolar mating system with the given assumptions. The expression can also be written as $\\frac{(n_A - 1)(n_B - 1)}{n_A n_B}$.

According to the problem statement, zygosporangium formation occurs if and only if at least one compatible encounter happens within the receptive window of duration $\\tau$. Therefore, the task reduces to calculating the probability of this event.\n\nLet us model the encounter process. The total number of encounters (both compatible and incompatible) with a given hypha in a time interval of length $t$ is described as a memoryless process with a constant rate $\\lambda$. This is the definition of a Poisson process. Let $N(t)$ be the random variable representing the total number of encounters in the time interval $[0, t]$. Then $N(t)$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda t$. The probability of having exactly $k$ encounters in this interval is given by the probability mass function:\n$$P(N(t) = k) = \\frac{(\\lambda t)^{k} \\exp(-\\lambda t)}{k!}$$\nfor $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n\nEach encounter is independently classified as \"compatible\" with probability $p$ or \"incompatible\" with probability $1-p$.

This corresponds to the event $N_c(\\tau) \\ge 1$. It is computationally more direct to first calculate the probability of the complementary event, which is that no compatible encounters occur during this window. This corresponds to the event $N_c(\\tau) = 0$.\n\nUsing the probability mass function for the thinned process $N_c(t)$ with $t = \\tau$ and $k=0$, we find the probability of no compatible encounters:\n$$P(N_c(\\tau) = 0) = \\frac{(\\lambda p \\tau)^{0} \\exp(-\\lambda p \\tau)}{0!}$$\nBy definition, $x^0 = 1$ for any $x$, and $0! = 1$.

An octad contains $4$ spores of genotype $K$ and $4$ spores of genotype $k$. Spores with genotype $K$ are resistant and survive with probability $1$. Thus, the $4$ $K$-spores always contribute $4$ live spores to the total.

For the ascus to exhibit a \"$2:2$ live:dead\" phenotype (total of $2$ live and $2$ dead spores), both sensitive $k$-spores must die.\n\nThe probability of a single $k$-spore dying is $s$. The deaths of the $2$ individual $k$-spores are independent events.
