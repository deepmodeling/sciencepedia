It is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the General Expression**\n\nThe multiplet fraction, $M$, is a conditional probability:\n$$M = P(N \\ge 2 \\mid N \\ge 1)$$\nBy the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$, we have:\n$$M = \\frac{P((N \\ge 2) \\cap (N \\ge 1))}{P(N \\ge 1)}$$\nThe event $(N \\ge 2) \\cap (N \\ge 1)$ is identical to the event $(N \\ge 2)$. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n$$M = \\frac{P(N \\ge 2)}{P(N \\ge 1)}$$\nWe now express the numerator and denominator using the Poisson PMF. The probability of a droplet containing zero cells ($k=0$) is:\n$$P(N=0) = \\frac{\\lambda^0 \\exp(-\\lambda)}{0!} = \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\nThe probability of a droplet containing exactly one cell ($k=1$) is:\n$$P(N=1) = \\frac{\\lambda^1 \\exp(-\\lambda)}{1!} = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\nThe denominator, $P(N \\ge 1)$, is the complement of having zero cells:\n$$P(N \\ge 1) = 1 - P(N=0) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\nThe numerator, $P(N \\ge 2)$, is the complement of having zero or one cell:\n$$P(N \\ge 2) = 1 - P(N=0) - P(N=1) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda) - \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $M$:\n$$M(\\lambda) = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda) - \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda)}{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)}$$\nThis can be simplified for analytical clarity:\n$$M(\\lambda) = \\frac{(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)) - \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda)}{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)} = 1 - \\frac{\\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda)}{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)}$$\nThis is the general expression for the multiplet fraction as a function of the loading parameter $\\lambda$.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Original Multiplet Fraction ($M_1$)**\n\nWe are given an initial droplet occupancy $O_1 = P(N \\ge 1) = 0.10$. Using the formula for occupancy:\n$$0.10 = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_1)$$\nSolving for $\\exp(-\\lambda_1)$:\n$$\\exp(-\\lambda_1) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$$\nThis implies that the original loading parameter is $\\lambda_1 = -\\ln(0.90)$.\nNow, we compute the original multiplet fraction $M_1$ using the general formula for $M(\\lambda)$ with $\\lambda = \\lambda_1$.\n$$M_1 = M(\\lambda_1) = 1 - \\frac{\\lambda_1 \\exp(-\\lambda_1)}{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_1)}$$\nSubstituting the known values $\\lambda_1 = -\\ln(0.90)$, $\\exp(-\\lambda_1) = 0.90$, and $1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_1) = 0.10$:\n$$M_1 = 1 - \\frac{(-\\ln(0.90)) \\times 0.90}{0.10} = 1 - 9(-\\ln(0.90)) = 1 + 9\\ln(0.90)$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of New Multiplet Fraction ($M_2$)**\n\nThe loading parameter is reduced to a new value, $\\lambda_2 = 0.05$. We compute the new multiplet fraction $M_2$ by substituting $\\lambda_2$ into the general formula:\n$$M_2 = M(0.05) = 1 - \\frac{0.05 \\exp(-0.05)}{1 - \\exp(-0.05)}$$\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of Fold-Change**\n\nThe fold-change $F$ is the ratio of the new multiplet fraction to the original one:\n$$F = \\frac{M_2}{M_1} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{0.05 \\exp(-0.05)}{1 - \\exp(-0.05)}}{1 + 9\\ln(0.90)}$$\nWe must now compute the numerical value.\nFirst, we evaluate $M_1$:\n$$M_1 = 1 + 9 \\ln(0.90) \\approx 1 + 9(-0.10536051565) = 1 - 0.94824464085 = 0.05175535915$$\nNext, we evaluate $M_2$:\n$$\\exp(-0.05) \\approx 0.9512294245$$\n$$1 - \\exp(-0.05) \\approx 0.0487705755$$\n$$M_2 = 1 - \\frac{0.05 \\times 0.9512294245}{0.0487705755} = 1 - \\frac{0.047561471225}{0.0487705755} \\approx 1 - 0.975207387 = 0.024792613$$\nFinally, we compute the fold-change $F$:\n$$F = \\frac{M_2}{M_1} \\approx \\frac{0.024792613}{0.05175535915} \\approx 0.47903874$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required by the problem statement gives $0.4790$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4790}$$", "id": "2837411"}, {"introduction": "Single-cell RNA sequencing data, especially from UMI-based protocols, is characterized by its sparsity, with a large fraction of zero counts.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded question typical of quantitative analysis in genomics. The solution process will proceed.\n\nThe task is to determine the zero-count probability predicted by the Negative Binomial (NB) model using the provided sample moments and compare it to the observed zero fraction.\n\nFirst, we estimate the parameters of the NB distribution, the mean $\\mu$ and the dispersion $\\phi$, from the sample data. We use the method of moments, equating the population moments to the sample moments.\nThe mean is estimated by the sample mean:\n$$ \\mu = \\hat{\\mu} = 0.30 $$\nThe dispersion parameter $\\phi$ is defined by the relationship:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}[X] = \\mu + \\phi \\mu^{2} $$\nWe use the sample variance $\\hat{v}$ as the estimate for $\\mathrm{Var}[X]$ and solve for $\\phi$:\n$$ \\phi = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}[X] - \\mu}{\\mu^{2}} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\phi = \\frac{\\hat{v} - \\hat{\\mu}}{\\hat{\\mu}^{2}} = \\frac{0.345 - 0.30}{(0.30)^2} = \\frac{0.045}{0.090} = 0.5 $$\nSo, the NB model fitted to the data has parameters $\\mu = 0.30$ and $\\phi = 0.5$.\n\nNext, we need the formula for the probability of observing a zero count, $P(X=0)$, for an NB distribution parameterized by its mean $\\mu$ and dispersion $\\phi$. The NB distribution can be parameterized by a size parameter $r$ and a success probability $p$. The relationship between $(\\mu, \\phi)$ and $(r, p)$ is found by comparing the expressions for mean and variance. For the NB distribution, $\\mu = r(1-p)/p$ and $\\mathrm{Var}[X] = r(1-p)/p^2 = \\mu/p$.\nComparing $\\mathrm{Var}[X]=\\mu/p$ with $\\mathrm{Var}[X] = \\mu + \\phi\\mu^2$, we get:\n$$ \\mu/p = \\mu(1 + \\phi\\mu) \\implies p = \\frac{1}{1 + \\phi\\mu} $$\nThis $p$ is the probability of failure in the standard Bernoulli trial parameterization. In the genomics context, it's often more intuitive to work with a different parameterization. Let's use the one that is directly derived from the Poisson-Gamma mixture, which leads to the probability mass function:\n$$ P(X=k) = \\frac{\\Gamma(k + r)}{\\Gamma(k+1)\\Gamma(r)} \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{r+\\mu}\\right)^k \\left(\\frac{r}{r+\\mu}\\right)^r $$\nIn this parameterization, $\\mathrm{Var}[X] = \\mu + \\mu^2/r$. Comparing this to $\\mathrm{Var}[X] = \\mu + \\phi\\mu^2$, we identify $r = 1/\\phi$.\nTherefore, the probability of a zero count ($k=0$) is:\n$$ P(X=0) = \\frac{\\Gamma(r)}{\\Gamma(1)\\Gamma(r)} \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{r+\\mu}\\right)^0 \\left(\\frac{r}{r+\\mu}\\right)^r = \\left(\\frac{r}{r+\\mu}\\right)^r $$\nSubstituting $r=1/\\phi$:\n$$ P(X=0)_{\\text{NB}} = \\left(\\frac{1/\\phi}{1/\\phi + \\mu}\\right)^{1/\\phi} = \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\phi\\mu}\\right)^{1/\\phi} $$\nNow we can compute the predicted zero probability using our estimated parameters $\\mu = 0.30$ and $\\phi = 0.5$:\n$$ P(X=0)_{\\text{NB}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + (0.5)(0.30)}\\right)^{1/0.5} = \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + 0.15}\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{1.15}\\right)^{2} $$\n$$ P(X=0)_{\\text{NB}} \\approx (0.869565)^2 \\approx 0.75614 $$\nThe predicted fraction of zero counts from the NB model is approximately $0.756$.\n\nFinally, we compare this prediction with the observed fraction of zeros, $\\hat{z}_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 0.75$.\n- Predicted zero fraction: $P(X=0)_{\\text{NB}} \\approx 0.756$\n- Observed zero fraction: $\\hat{z}_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 0.75$\n\nThe difference is $0.756 - 0.75 = 0.006$. The observed value is very close to the predicted value. We must now evaluate the options based on this finding.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis:**\n\n**A. The observed zero fraction significantly exceeds the Negative Binomial prediction, implying an additional, zero-inflated component beyond simple sampling and heterogeneity.**\nThis statement claims that $\\hat{z}_{\\mathrm{obs}} > P(X=0)_{\\text{NB}}$. Our calculation shows the opposite: $0.75  0.756$. The observed zero fraction is slightly lower than, not higher than, the NB prediction. Therefore, there is no evidence for an *additional* zero-inflated component.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The observed zero fraction is consistent with the Negative Binomial prediction within sampling error; the simple sampling model suffices, and zero inflation is not expected for Unique Molecular Identifier counts for this gene under these conditions.**\nThis option claims that $\\hat{z}_{\\mathrm{obs}} \\approx P(X=0)_{\\text{NB}}$. The values $0.75$ and $0.756$ are indeed very close. To assess \"within sampling error,\" we can calculate the standard error of the observed proportion. For a binomial process with $N=10000$ trials and probability $p_0 \\approx 0.756$, the standard error is $\\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)/N} = \\sqrt{0.756(0.244)/10000} \\approx \\sqrt{0.00001845} \\approx 0.0043$. The observed difference of $0.006$ is approximately $0.006/0.0043 \\approx 1.4$ standard errors from the prediction. This is not statistically significant at conventional levels (e.g., $\\alpha = 0.05$, which requires a Z-score of $\\approx 1.96$), supporting the conclusion that the observation is consistent with the model. The statement that the simple NB model suffices and that excess zero-inflation is less of a concern for UMI data is also correct in the context of single-cell biology.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The observed zero fraction is lower than the Negative Binomial prediction, indicating a mechanism that suppresses zeros (“zero deflation”), so the Negative Binomial model is inappropriate.**\nThe first part is correct: $0.75  0.756$. However, to conclude that this small difference indicates a special mechanism and renders the entire model \"inappropriate\" is an unjustifiably strong conclusion. As analyzed for option B, the difference is small and statistically insignificant. The NB model provides an excellent fit for the zero fraction.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. No conclusion can be drawn because the dispersion cannot be identified without external spike-in controls.**\nThis is factually incorrect. The dispersion parameter $\\phi$ was successfully estimated using the method of moments from the sample mean and variance provided in the problem statement. While spike-in controls offer one way to estimate technical noise parameters, it is not the only method, and parameters for a biological variability model can be estimated directly from the gene's expression distribution across cells, as was done here.

It describes a standard and important statistical procedure in bioinformatics. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nDerivation of the BH-Adjusted Value (q-value):\nThe Benjamini-Hochberg procedure controls the FDR at a chosen level $\\alpha$. The procedure is as follows: given the ordered raw p-values $p_{(1)}, p_{(2)}, \\dots, p_{(n)}$, find the largest integer $k$ such that $p_{(k)} \\leq \\frac{k}{n}\\alpha$. If such a $k$ exists, reject the null hypotheses corresponding to the p-values $p_{(1)}, p_{(2)}, \\dots, p_{(k)}$.\n\nThe q-value for the gene with the $i$-th ordered p-value, $p_{(i)}$, is defined as the smallest FDR level $\\alpha$ at which the null hypothesis for this gene, $H_{(i)}$, would be rejected. For $H_{(i)}$ to be rejected, the largest index $k$ satisfying the BH condition must be greater than or equal to $i$. In other words, there must exist some index $j \\geq i$ for which the condition $p_{(j)} \\leq \\frac{j}{n}\\alpha$ is met.\n\nThis inequality can be rearranged to solve for $\\alpha$: $\\alpha \\geq \\frac{n p_{(j)}}{j}$.\nFor $H_{(i)}$ to be rejected, this condition must hold for at least one $j \\in \\{i, i+1, \\dots, n\\}$. The smallest $\\alpha$ that guarantees this is the minimum of all such lower bounds on $\\alpha$.\nTherefore, the q-value for the $i$-th ordered p-value, denoted $q_{(i)}$, is given by the expression:\n$$q_{(i)} = \\min_{j=i, \\dots, n} \\left\\{ \\frac{n p_{(j)}}{j} \\right\\}$$\nThis must also be capped at $1$, so more formally $q_{(i)} = \\min_{j=i, \\dots, n} \\left\\{ \\min\\left(1, \\frac{n p_{(j)}}{j}\\right) \\right\\}$.\n\nExplanation of Monotonicity Correction:\nThe raw sorted p-values are, by definition, non-decreasing: $p_{(1)} \\le p_{(2)} \\le \\dots \\le p_{(n)}$. It is a desirable property that the adjusted p-values also be non-decreasing, i.e., $q_{(1)} \\le q_{(2)} \\le \\dots \\le q_{(n)}$. A gene with a more significant (smaller) raw p-value should not receive a less significant (larger) adjusted p-value.\n\nIf one were to naively define an adjusted p-value for rank $i$ as simply $\\frac{n p_{(i)}}{i}$, this monotonicity would not be guaranteed, as the ratio $\\frac{p_{(i)}}{i}$ is not necessarily non-decreasing. The expression derived above, $q_{(i)} = \\min_{j=i, \\dots, n} \\{ \\frac{n p_{(j)}}{j} \\}$, enforces this monotonicity. This can be seen by observing the relationship between $q_{(i)}$ and $q_{(i+1)}$:\n$$q_{(i)} = \\min\\left( \\frac{n p_{(i)}}{i}, \\min_{j=i+1, \\dots, n} \\left\\{ \\frac{n p_{(j)}}{j} \\right\\} \\right) = \\min\\left( \\frac{n p_{(i)}}{i}, q_{(i+1)} \\right)$$\nFrom this, it is clear that $q_{(i)} \\leq q_{(i+1)}$ for all $i=1, \\dots, n-1$.\n\nThe \"step-down\" nature of the correction refers to an efficient algorithm for computing these q-values. One starts from the largest rank, $i=n$, and proceeds downwards to $i=1$:\n1. Set $q_{(n)} = \\frac{n p_{(n)}}{n} = p_{(n)}$.\n2. For $i = n-1, n-2, \\dots, 1$, compute $q_{(i)} = \\min\\left(q_{(i+1)}, \\frac{n p_{(i)}}{i}\\right)$.\nThis recursive calculation is equivalent to the closed-form expression derived earlier and ensures that the resulting sequence of q-values $\\{q_{(i)}\\}$ is monotonic non-decreasing. The \"correction\" is the act of taking the minimum with the previously computed (and more lenient) q-value $q_{(i+1)}$, which prevents $q_{(i)}$ from becoming larger than $q_{(i+1)}$.\n\nComputation of the q-value for $p_{(3)}$:\nWe need to compute $q_{(3)}$ using the derived formula:\n$$q_{(3)} = \\min_{k=3, \\dots, 10000} \\left\\{ \\frac{10000 \\cdot p_{(k)}}{k} \\right\\}$$\nLet us compute the first few terms of the sequence $\\frac{n p_{(k)}}{k}$:\nFor $k=3$:\n$$\\frac{10000 \\cdot p_{(3)}}{3} = \\frac{10000 \\cdot (4.9 \\times 10^{-6})}{3} = \\frac{0.049}{3} \\approx 0.016333...$$\nFor $k=4$:\n$$\\frac{10000 \\cdot p_{(4)}}{4} = \\frac{10000 \\cdot (7.5 \\times 10^{-6})}{4} = \\frac{0.075}{4} = 0.01875$$\nFor $k=5$:\n$$\\frac{10000 \\cdot p_{(5)}}{5} = \\frac{10000 \\cdot (1.0 \\times 10^{-4})}{5} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$$\nFor $k=6$:\n$$\\frac{10000 \\cdot p_{(6)}}{6} = \\frac{10000 \\cdot (1.5 \\times 10^{-3})}{6} = \\frac{15}{6} = 2.5$$\nFor any $k \\ge 7$, we are given that $p_{(k)} \\ge 0.05$. Therefore, the corresponding terms in the sequence are bounded from below:\n$$\\frac{10000 \\cdot p_{(k)}}{k} \\ge \\frac{10000 \\cdot 0.05}{k} = \\frac{500}{k}$$\nThe smallest possible value of this lower bound occurs for the largest $k$, which is $k=10000$, giving $\\frac{500}{10000} = 0.05$. Even for the smallest index in this range, $k=7$, the lower bound is $\\frac{500}{7} \\approx 71.4$. In any case, for all $k \\ge 7$, the term $\\frac{n p_{(k)}}{k}$ is greater than or equal to $0.05$.\n\nWe seek the minimum of the set:\n$$\\{0.016333..., 0.01875, 0.2, 2.5, \\text{and all terms for } k \\ge 7\\}$$\nSince all terms for $k \\ge 7$ are at least $0.05$, they are all larger than the term for $k=3$. The minimum of the entire set is therefore the value computed for $k=3$.\n$$q_{(3)} = \\frac{0.049}{3} \\approx 0.016333...$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives $0.01633$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.01633}$$", "id": "2837373"}]}
