The solution must be derived from first principles of chemical thermodynamics.\n\nFirst, we address the derivation of the freezing point depression equation. The condition for thermodynamic equilibrium between a solid solvent (ice) and a liquid solution is the equality of the chemical potential, $\\mu$, of the solvent (water) in both phases:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{H_2O, s}}(T, P) = \\mu_{\\mathrm{H_2O, \\ell}}(T, P, x_{\\mathrm{H_2O}})\n$$\nHere, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{H_2O, s}}$ is the chemical potential of pure solid water, and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{H_2O, \\ell}}$ is the chemical potential of water in the liquid solution at temperature $T$, pressure $P$, and mole fraction of water $x_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}$.\n\nFor an ideal solution, as stipulated, the chemical potential of the solvent is related to that of the pure solvent, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{H_2O, \\ell}}^*$, by Raoult's law:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{H_2O, \\ell}}(T, P, x_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}) = \\mu_{\\mathrm{H_2O, \\ell}}^*(T, P) + RT \\ln(x_{\\mathrm{H_2O}})\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the ideal gas constant. Substituting this into the equilibrium condition gives:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{H_2O, s}}(T, P) - \\mu_{\\mathrm{H_2O, \\ell}}^*(T, P) = RT \\ln(x_{\\mathrm{H_2O}})\n$$\nThe left side is the molar Gibbs free energy of fusion, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fus},m}$, of pure water at temperature $T$ and pressure $P$. Note that $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fus},m} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{H_2O, \\ell}}^* - \\mu_{\\mathrm{H_2O, s}}$, so we have:\n$$\n- \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fus},m}(T) = RT \\ln(x_{\\mathrm{H_2O}})\n$$\nThe temperature dependence of $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fus},m}$ is given by the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation.

We can express this relationship as $D(x) = c \\Phi(x)$, where $c$ is a constant of proportionality. The surface dose rate, $D_0$, is then $D(0) = c \\Phi(0) = c \\Phi_0$.

The sum of two independent Poisson-distributed random variables is also a Poisson-distributed random variable, with a mean equal to the sum of the individual means.\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{total}} = E[N_{\\mathrm{lethal}}] = \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = \\alpha D + \\beta D^2 $$\nThe survival fraction, $S(D)$, is defined as the probability of experiencing zero lethal events, i.e., $P(N_{\\mathrm{lethal}} = 0)$. For a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{total}}$, the probability of observing $k=0$ events is given by:\n$$ P(k=0) = \\frac{(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{total}})^0 \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\mathrm{total}})}{0!} = \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\mathrm{total}}) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{total}}$, we derive the functional form of the survival fraction, which is the Linear-Quadratic model:\n$$ S(D) = \\exp(-(\\alpha D + \\beta D^2)) $$\nThe next task is to find the dose $D_{0.1}$ at which the survival fraction is $0.1$.\n$$ S(D_{0.1}) = 0.1 $$\n$$ \\exp(-(\\alpha D_{0.1} + \\beta D_{0.1}^2)) = 0.1 $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -(\\alpha D_{0.1} + \\beta D_{0.1}^2) = \\ln(0.1) = -\\ln(10) $$\nThis rearranges into a standard quadratic equation for $D_{0.1}$:\n$$ \\beta D_{0.1}^2 + \\alpha D_{0.1} - \\ln(10) = 0 $$\nThe solution for $D_{0.1}$ is found using the quadratic formula, $D = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a=\\beta$, $b=\\alpha$, and $c=-\\ln(10)$.\n$$ D_{0.1} = \\frac{-\\alpha \\pm \\sqrt{\\alpha^2 - 4(\\beta)(-\\ln(10))}}{2\\beta} = \\frac{-\\alpha \\pm \\sqrt{\\alpha^2 + 4\\beta\\ln(10)}}{2\\beta} $$\nSince dose $D$ must be a non-negative physical quantity ($D \\ge 0$), and since $\\alpha > 0$ and $\\beta > 0$, the term $\\sqrt{\\alpha^2 + 4\\beta\\ln(10)}$ is strictly greater than $\\alpha$. Thus, we must select the positive root to ensure $D > 0$.\n$$ D_{0.1} = \\frac{-\\alpha + \\sqrt{\\alpha^2 + 4\\beta\\ln(10)}}{2\\beta} $$\nNow, we apply this formula to the two strains. For the wild type (WT):\n$$ \\beta_{\\mathrm{WT}} (D_{0.1}^{\\mathrm{WT}})^2 + \\alpha_{\\mathrm{WT}} (D_{0.1}^{\\mathrm{WT}}) - \\ln(10) = 0 $$\nFor the HR-deficient mutant ($\\Delta$):\n$$ \\beta_{\\Delta} (D_{0.1}^{\\Delta})^2 + \\alpha_{\\Delta} (D_{0.1}^{\\Delta}) - \\ln(10) = 0 $$\nWe are given the parameter relationships: $\\alpha_{\\Delta} = 0.30\\ \\mathrm{Gy}^{-1} = 2 \\times (0.15\\ \\mathrm{Gy}^{-1}) = 2\\alpha_{\\mathrm{WT}}$ and $\\beta_{\\Delta} = 0.08\\ \\mathrm{Gy}^{-2} = 4 \\times (0.02\\ \\mathrm{Gy}^{-2}) = 4\\beta_{\\mathrm{WT}}$.\nLet us substitute these relationships into the equation for the mutant strain:\n$$ (4\\beta_{\\mathrm{WT}}) (D_{0.1}^{\\Delta})^2 + (2\\alpha_{\\mathrm{WT}}) (D_{0.1}^{\\Delta}) - \\ln(10) = 0 $$\nLet us now test the hypothesis that $D_{0.1}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = 2 D_{0.1}^{\\Delta}$, which is equivalent to $D_{0.1}^{\\Delta} = D_{0.1}^{\\mathrm{WT}} / 2$. We substitute this into the mutant's equation:\n$$ 4\\beta_{\\mathrm{WT}} \\left(\\frac{D_{0.1}^{\\mathrm{WT}}}{2}\\right)^2 + 2\\alpha_{\\mathrm{WT}} \\left(\\frac{D_{0.1}^{\\mathrm{WT}}}{2}\\right) - \\ln(10) = 0 $$\n$$ 4\\beta_{\\mathrm{WT}} \\frac{(D_{0.1}^{\\mathrm{WT}})^2}{4} + \\alpha_{\\mathrm{WT}} D_{0.1}^{\\mathrm{WT}} - \\ln(10) = 0 $$\n$$ \\beta_{\\mathrm{WT}} (D_{0.1}^{\\mathrm{WT}})^2 + \\alpha_{\\mathrm{WT}} D_{0.1}^{\\mathrm{WT}} - \\ln(10) = 0 $$\nThis resulting equation is identical to the quadratic equation for the wild type. This proves that the relationship $D_{0.1}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = 2 D_{0.1}^{\\Delta}$ is analytically exact, given the specific relations between the parameters.\nTherefore, the ratio $R$ is:\n$$ R = \\frac{D_{0.1}^{\\mathrm{WT}}}{D_{0.1}^{\\Delta}} = 2 $$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. Expressing the integer $2$ to $4$ significant figures gives $2.000$.\n\nFor completeness, the intermediate doses are calculated. We use $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$.\nFor the wild type:\n$$ D_{0.1}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = \\frac{-0.15 + \\sqrt{(0.15)^2 + 4(0.02)(2.302585)}}{2(0.02)} = \\frac{-0.15 + \\sqrt{0.0225 + 0.1842068}}{0.04} \\approx 7.616\\ \\mathrm{Gy} $$\nFor the mutant:\n$$ D_{0.1}^{\\Delta} = \\frac{-0.30 + \\sqrt{(0.30)^2 + 4(0.08)(2.302585)}}{2(0.08)} = \\frac{-0.30 + \\sqrt{0.09 + 0.736828}}{0.16} \\approx 3.808\\ \\mathrm{Gy} $$\nThe ratio of these numerical results is $7.616 / 3.808 = 2$, which confirms the analytical derivation.\n\nFinally, for the interpretative part, which is not graded: The $\\alpha$ parameter represents lethality from single, irreparable events, while the $\\beta$ parameter represents lethality from the interaction of two sublethal, potentially reparable lesions. The mutant is deficient in homologous recombination (HR), a major DNA repair pathway. Comparing the mutant to the wild type, the $\\alpha$ parameter doubles ($\\alpha_{\\Delta} = 2\\alpha_{\\mathrm{WT}}$), while the $\\beta$ parameter quadruples ($\\beta_{\\Delta} = 4\\beta_{\\mathrm{WT}}$). The proportionally larger increase in $\\beta$ indicates that the loss of HR has a more dramatic effect on the cell's ability to cope with sublethal, interacting damage than on its ability to survive single-hit lethal events. This demonstrates that under these conditions, the HR pathway in the wild type is particularly efficient at repairing the sublethal lesions that contribute to the quadratic component of cell killing.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.000}$$", "id": "2777378"}]}
