Consider a pathogen colonizing a leaf where, prior to immune suppression, pathogen biomass follows exponential growth: if biomass at time $t$ is $B(t)$ and the initial biomass at $t=0$ is $B_{0}$, then $B(t)=B_{0}\\exp(r t)$ with growth rate $r>0$.

It is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and conditions defined. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed to a solution.\n\nFirst, we must establish a relationship between the growth rate $r$ and the doubling time $T_{d}$. By definition, at $t=T_{d}$, the biomass is $B(T_{d}) = 2B_{0}$. Using the growth model, we also have $B(T_{d}) = B_{0}\\exp(r T_{d})$. Equating these two expressions gives:\n$$B_{0}\\exp(r T_{d}) = 2B_{0}$$\nSince $B_{0} > 0$, we can divide by it to obtain:\n$$\\exp(r T_{d}) = 2$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides yields:\n$$r T_{d} = \\ln(2)$$\nFrom this, we can express the growth rate $r$ in terms of the doubling time $T_{d}$:\n$$r = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_{d}}$$\n\nNext, we formalize the primary constraint of the problem: the pathogen biomass must never reach $2B_{0}$. The biomass grows according to $B(t)=B_{0}\\exp(r t)$ until the time $t_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, at which point growth is instantaneously and completely arrested. Consequently, the maximum biomass ever attained by the pathogen is the biomass at the moment of arrest, $B(t_{\\mathrm{eff}})$. The constraint can thus be stated as a strict inequality:\n$$B(t_{\\mathrm{eff}}) < 2B_{0}$$\n\nWe substitute the expression for biomass into this inequality:\n$$B_{0}\\exp(r t_{\\mathrm{eff}}) < 2B_{0}$$\nAgain, dividing by the non-zero initial biomass $B_{0}$:\n$$\\exp(r t_{\\mathrm{eff}}) < 2$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$r t_{\\mathrm{eff}} < \\ln(2)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $r$ from our first derivation:\n$$\\left( \\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_{d}} \\right) t_{\\mathrm{eff}} < \\ln(2)$$\nSince $\\ln(2) > 0$, we can divide both sides by $\\ln(2)$ without changing the inequality's direction:\n$$\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{T_{d}} < 1$$\nThis leads to the simple and intuitive condition that the effective time of the immune response must be less than the pathogen's doubling time:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{eff}} < T_{d}$$\n\nThe problem defines the effective time as $t_{\\mathrm{eff}} = t_{\\mathrm{tr}} + T_{E}$. Substituting this into our inequality:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{tr}} + T_{E} < T_{d}$$\nWe are asked to find the latest permissible trigger time, $t_{\\mathrm{tr}}$. We solve for $t_{\\mathrm{tr}}$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{tr}} < T_{d} - T_{E}$$\nThis inequality specifies the valid range for the trigger time. The latest permissible time is the supremum of this interval, which is $T_{d} - T_{E}$. Let us call this $t_{\\mathrm{tr,max}}$.\n$$t_{\\mathrm{tr,max}} = T_{d} - T_{E}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values. It is crucial to maintain consistent units. The desired answer is in minutes.\nGiven $T_{d} = 2$ hours. We convert this to minutes:\n$$T_{d} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\times \\frac{60 \\text{ minutes}}{1 \\text{ hour}} = 120 \\text{ minutes}$$\nGiven $T_{E} = 30$ minutes.\n\nNow we can calculate the latest permissible trigger time:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{tr,max}} = 120 \\text{ minutes} - 30 \\text{ minutes} = 90 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\nThus, the immune response must be triggered no later than $90$ minutes after the initial colonization to ensure the pathogen population does not reach double its initial size.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{90}$$", "id": "2824671"}, {"introduction": "Immunity is not without its costs, a reality that drives the evolution of plant defense strategies.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to compute the net fitness effects, denoted as $s_{R+}$ for R-gene carriers and $s_{R-}$ for non-carriers. The fitness effect is defined as $s = W - 1$, where $W$ is the expected reproductive output. We must calculate the expected fitness for each genotype.\n\nFirst, we determine the effective PTI efficacy, $e'_{\\mathrm{PTI}}$, under effector attack.\n$$\ne'_{\\mathrm{PTI}} = 0.5 \\times e_{\\mathrm{PTI}} = 0.5 \\times 0.6 = 0.3\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the expected fitness for hosts lacking the R-gene ($R-$). These hosts are infected and rely solely on their suppressed PTI. Their fitness, $W_{R-}$, is the baseline fitness of $1$ reduced by the constitutive cost of PTI and the damage from infection.\nThe fitness loss from infection is the baseline loss $L$ reduced by the effective PTI, giving a net loss of $L(1 - e'_{\\mathrm{PTI}})$.\nThe total fitness is thus:\n$$\nW_{R-} = 1 - c_{\\mathrm{PTI}} - L(1 - e'_{\\mathrm{PTI}})\n$$\nThe net fitness effect, $s_{R-}$, is:\n$$\ns_{R-} = W_{R-} - 1 = -c_{\\mathrm{PTI}} - L(1 - e'_{\\mathrm{PTI}})\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\ns_{R-} = -0.02 - 0.5 \\times (1 - 0.3) = -0.02 - 0.5 \\times 0.7 = -0.02 - 0.35 = -0.37\n$$\n\nNow, we calculate the expected fitness for hosts that carry the R-gene ($R+$). These hosts always pay the maintenance costs for both PTI and the R-gene, $c_{\\mathrm{PTI}}$ and $c_R$. Upon infection, one of two mutually exclusive outcomes occurs:\n1.  ETI is triggered, with probability $p_{\\mathrm{ETI}} = 0.3$. In this case, the host incurs an additional execution cost $c_{\\mathrm{ETI}}$, but the infection loss is negligible ($0$).
