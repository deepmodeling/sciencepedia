The foundational model for net CO$_2$ assimilation, $A$, is given by the balance of Rubisco carboxylation ($V_c$), photorespiratory CO$_2$ release ($\\frac{1}{2}V_o$), and mitochondrial respiration in the light ($R_d$):\n$$A = V_c - \\frac{1}{2}V_o - R_d$$\nWe apply this model to the two experimental conditions.\n\nFor the condition at $2\\%\\ \\mathrm{O_2}$, the problem states we must assume that photorespiratory oxygenation is negligible. This implies that the rate of oxygenation, $V_{o,2}$, is approximately zero: $V_{o,2} \\approx 0$. The assimilation equation for this condition simplifies to:\n$$A_{2} = V_{c,2} - R_d$$\nwhere $V_{c,2}$ is the rate of carboxylation at $2\\%\\ \\mathrm{O_2}$.

The experiment was conducted at a constant chloroplastic CO$_2$ partial pressure, $C_c$. The foundational bases provided in the problem do not include a mechanism for oxygen to act as a competitive inhibitor of carboxylation. Therefore, within the constraints of the problem's defined model, the rate of carboxylation $V_c$ is determined by $C_c$ (and other constant factors like temperature and enzyme activation state).
