It is a flux density of energy. The standard units are watts per square meter ($\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$). It describes the rate at which energy is delivered to a surface.\n\n- **Fluence ($H_e$)**: This is the total radiant energy delivered to a surface per unit area, accumulated over a given time interval. It is the time-integral of irradiance. If the irradiance $E_e$ is constant over a duration $t$, then $H_e = E_e \\cdot t$. The standard units are joules per square meter ($\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}}$).\n\n- **Photon Flux Density ($E_p$)**: This is the quantum equivalent of irradiance. It is the number of photons incident on a surface per unit area per unit time. Its units can be photons per second per square meter ($\\mathrm{photons\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2}}$) or, more conveniently in chemistry and biology, moles of photons per second per square meter ($\\mathrm{mol\\,photons\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2}}$).\n\n- **Spectral Photon Flux Density ($E_{p,\\lambda}$)**: This is the photon flux density per unit wavelength interval at a specific wavelength $\\lambda$. It describes how the photon flux density is distributed over the spectrum. The units are typically $\\mathrm{mol\\,photons\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2}\\,nm^{-1}}$, corresponding to the specified units of spectral irradiance ($S_{\\lambda}$). Total photon flux density is the integral of the spectral photon flux density over all wavelengths: $E_p = \\int_0^\\infty E_{p,\\lambda} d\\lambda$.\n\nThe problem uses the symbol $F_c$ for a photon fluence threshold, which corresponds to a time-integrated photon flux density.\n\n(ii) Derivation of the conversion from spectral irradiance $S_{\\lambda}$ to spectral photon flux density.\n\nLet the spectral photon flux density in moles be denoted by $N_{p,\\lambda}$.

Photon fluence is the time-integral of the photon flux density. For a constant photon flux density $J_p$, the fluence after an exposure duration $t$ is $F_p = J_p \\cdot t$.

Unilateral Light Emitting Diode (LED) blue illumination.\n    2. A single-axis clinostat.\n    3. The auxin efflux inhibitor N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA).\n    4. Imaging system to track tip trajectories over time.\n- **Assumed Principles and Definitions:**\n    1. In shoots, phototropism is mediated by phototropins absorbing blue light, causing lateral auxin redistribution to the shaded flank, leading to curvature towards light.\n    2. In shoots, gravitropism arises from amyloplast sedimentation, reorienting auxin transporters to increase auxin on the lower flank, causing upward curvature.\n    3. Both phototropism and gravitropism require polar auxin transport.\n    4.

A clinostat abolishes a stable gravity vector in the plant’s frame when its rotation period is short compared to the gravity-sensing integration time.\n    6. Phototropic responsiveness is gated by the circadian clock, requiring control for circadian and photoperiodic state.\n\n#### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the established criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly based on established principles of plant physiology. The mechanisms described for phototropism (blue light, phototropins, auxin), gravitropism (statoliths, auxin), the role of polar auxin transport, the function of a clinostat, and the influence of the circadian clock are all standard, well-verified concepts in plant biology. The organism (*Arabidopsis thaliana*), chemical inhibitor (NPA), and physical apparatus (clinostat) are standard tools for this field of inquiry.\n- **Well-Posed:** The objective is clearly stated: to design an experiment to quantitatively separate two interacting biological responses. The assumption of linear vector addition for the initial response provides a clear mathematical framework for solving the problem, making it well-posed. The question asks for the *best* design among choices, which is a standard format for evaluating understanding of experimental methodology.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and clearly articulated. It represents a valid and non-trivial problem in experimental design within the field of plant biology. Therefore, a full analysis of the options is warranted.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe goal is to design an experiment that disentangles phototropic and gravitropic curvature rates. Based on the provided principles, a rigorous design must incorporate the following elements:\n\n1.  **Stimulus Specificity:** Phototropism is a blue-light response. Therefore, unilateral blue light must be used.\n2.  **Isolation of Variables:** To measure the phototropic response ($\\vec{C}_{photo}$) in isolation, the gravitropic stimulus must be negated. The provided clinostat achieves this by time-averaging the gravity vector, preventing the establishment of a consistent \"down\" direction for the plant.\n3.  **Measurement of Combined Response:** To measure the net response ($\\vec{C}_{net}$), both stimuli must be present. A horizontally oriented seedling is subject to a gravity vector pointing downwards and a unilateral light vector from the side. This setup allows for the simultaneous action of both tropisms.\n4.  **Quantitative Separation:** The principle of linear additivity for early responses, $\\vec{C}_{net} = \\vec{C}_{photo} + \\vec{C}_{gravi}$, is key. By experimentally measuring $\\vec{C}_{photo}$ (from the clinostat experiment) and $\\vec{C}_{net}$ (from the static experiment), the gravitropic component can be calculated via vector subtraction: $\\vec{C}_{gravi} = \\vec{C}_{net} - \\vec{C}_{photo}$.\n5.  **Biochemical Control:** The problem requires a control for auxin-transport dependence. Both tropisms depend on polar auxin transport. NPA is provided as an inhibitor of this process. An experiment including an NPA treatment alongside a vehicle control is necessary to confirm that the observed curvatures are indeed auxin-dependent phenomena. A significant reduction in curvature in the presence of NPA would validate the biological basis of the measurement.\n6.  **Temporal and Developmental Control:**\n    - The linear additivity assumption is only valid for \"short times\". Thus, the experiment must capture the initial rate of curvature with high temporal resolution, not a long-term final angle.\n    - Etiolated seedlings are ideal as they are highly sensitive to light and provide a \"clean slate\" without the complexities of prior light exposure (de-etiolation).\n    - Phototropic sensitivity is gated by the circadian clock. Experiments must be synchronized to a specific Zeitgeber Time (ZT) to ensure reproducibility and valid comparisons between conditions.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Use $3$-day-old etiolated Arabidopsis hypocotyls entrained to a $12\\!:\\!12$ light–dark photoperiod and conduct all trials at a fixed Zeitgeber Time (ZT) of $ZT = 2 \\ \\text{h}$ in darkness immediately before stimulation. Mount seedlings with their long axes horizontal. Illuminate unilaterally with blue LED light at wavelength $\\lambda = 470 \\ \\text{nm}$ and photon flux $I = 1 \\ \\mu \\text{mol} \\ \\text{m}^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$ from one side. Image tip position at $1 \\ \\text{frame} \\ \\text{min}^{-1}$ for $t \\le 20 \\ \\text{min}$. Run in parallel: static plates and plates on a clinostat rotating at $1 \\ \\text{rpm}$ (period $T = 60 \\ \\text{s}$), and, within each, a vehicle control and $10 \\ \\mu \\text{M}$ NPA pretreatment. From the clinostat condition, obtain the early-time phototropic curvature vector. From the static condition, obtain the early-time net curvature vector. Use early-time vector decomposition to estimate separate phototropic and gravitropic curvature rates. Verify that NPA suppresses both curvature vectors. Maintain temperature at $22 ^\\circ \\text{C}$.**\n\n-   **Critique:** This design is methodologically impeccable. It uses etiolated seedlings and controls for circadian phase ($ZT = 2 \\ \\text{h}$). It uses the correct stimulus (unilateral blue light, $\\lambda = 470 \\ \\text{nm}$). The horizontal mounting correctly sets up orthogonal stimuli. The use of a static vs. clinostat ($1 \\ \\text{rpm}$ is a suitable speed) comparison correctly isolates the phototropic vector and measures the net vector. The high-resolution, short-term imaging ($1 \\ \\text{frame} \\ \\text{min}^{-1}$ for $t \\le 20 \\ \\text{min}$) is appropriate for capturing the initial rates where linear addition holds. The inclusion of vehicle vs. NPA treatments provides the essential auxin-transport control. The analysis plan (vector decomposition) is precisely the correct application of the given principles.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Use $3$-day-old light-grown Arabidopsis hypocotyls left vertical. Illuminate unilaterally with blue light at $\\lambda = 470 \\ \\text{nm}$, $I = 1 \\ \\mu \\text{mol} \\ \\text{m}^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$. Image tip position every $10 \\ \\text{min}$ for $t \\le 120 \\ \\text{min}$. Place a subset on a clinostat rotating at $1 \\ \\text{revolution} \\ \\text{h}^{-1}$ and pretreat another subset with $10 \\ \\mu \\text{M}$ NPA. Attribute any difference between static and clinostat to gravitropism and any difference between vehicle and NPA to phototropism.**\n\n-   **Critique:** This design contains multiple fundamental flaws.\n    1.  **Orientation:** The vertical orientation is incorrect for separating phototropism and gravitropism. In this configuration, gravitropism acts as a straightening mechanism, not as an independent bending stimulus that can be added vectorially to the phototropic stimulus.\n    2.  **Clinostat Speed:** A rotation rate of $1 \\ \\text{revolution} \\ \\text{h}^{-1}$ (period $T = 60 \\ \\text{min}$) is far too slow. The gravity perception time is on the order of minutes. The plant would continuously perceive a changing gravity vector and attempt to respond, leading to complex movements, not the nullification of the gravity signal.\n    3.  **Temporal Resolution:** Imaging every $10$ minutes over $120$ minutes is too sparse and too long. This measures a late, integrated response where non-linearities dominate, invalidating the vector addition assumption.\n    4.  **Analysis Logic:** The attribution of \"difference between vehicle and NPA to phototropism\" is a grave error. NPA inhibits polar auxin transport, which is required for *both* tropisms. This difference reflects the total auxin-dependent response, not just phototropism.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Use $3$-day-old etiolated hypocotyls mounted horizontally. Illuminate unilaterally with red LED light at $\\lambda = 660 \\ \\text{nm}$, $I = 1 \\ \\mu \\text{mol} \\ \\text{m}^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.

Analyze final curvature after $t = 30 \\ \\text{min}$ as the phototropic component and the clinostat–static difference as the gravitropic component.**\n\n-   **Critique:** The fatal flaw is the use of red light ($\\lambda = 660 \\ \\text{nm}$). The problem explicitly states phototropism is mediated by phototropins that absorb *blue light*. While red light, via phytochromes, can modulate phototropism, it is not the primary stimulus. This experiment would fail to elicit a strong, canonical phototropic response.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Use $3$-day-old etiolated hypocotyls mounted horizontally. Illuminate unilaterally with blue light at $\\lambda = 470 \\ \\text{nm}$, $I = 1 \\ \\mu \\text{mol} \\ \\text{m}^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$. Run static versus clinostat at $1 \\ \\text{rpm}$ with vehicle only. Record final curvature angle after $t = 24 \\ \\text{h}$; assign the clinostat value to phototropism and the difference to gravitropism.**\n\n-   **Critique:** This design has two major flaws.\n    1.  **No NPA Control:** It omits the NPA treatment, failing to include the \"internal auxin-transport dependence control\" required by the problem statement.\n    2.  **Timescale:** Analyzing the final angle after $t = 24 \\ \\text{h}$ is completely inappropriate. The assumption of linear additivity is only valid for the initial response (\"short times\"). Over $24$ hours, the system is highly non-linear, involving complex feedback, adaptation, and developmental changes. The final angle is an integrated result, not a measure of the initial rate.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Use $3$-day-old etiolated hypocotyls mounted horizontally.

This option explicitly discards the clinostat (\"Do not use a clinostat\") and introduces a tool (a mutant line) that was not listed.\n    2.  **Control:** It does not use NPA and therefore does not provide the specific \"internal auxin-transport dependence control\" requested. The genetic control serves a different, albeit related, purpose. The task is to design an experiment with the given tools.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2825056"}, {"introduction": "For nearly a century, the identity of \"florigen\"—the mobile signal that travels from leaf to apex to trigger flowering—was a central mystery in plant science.

Grafting provides a means to test movement of leaf-derived signals into a recipient apex.\n\nYou are given the following genetic lines: wild type (WT), an FT loss-of-function mutant (ft-10), a CONSTANS loss-of-function mutant (co-9), a transgenic line expressing FT from the Sucrose transporter 2 promoter in phloem companion cells (SUC2:FT), a transgenic promoter control line (SUC2:GUS), and a line expressing FT from the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (CaMV 35S:FT). You can impose either LD cycles of $16$ h light/$8$ h dark or SD cycles of $8$ h light/$16$ h dark after graft union formation. Standard epicotyl grafting is available, and you can selectively remove or retain leaves on donor and recipient sides after the graft has taken.\n\nWhich experimental design and photoperiod treatment would most cleanly demonstrate that FT is a mobile florigen originating in leaves and sufficient to induce flowering at a recipient SAM that cannot itself produce FT? Choose the single best option that, if the predicted outcomes occur, would unambiguously support FT mobility. Each option specifies donor (rootstock) and recipient (scion) genotypes, leaf manipulations, photoperiods, and the key outcome criterion to conclude FT mobility.\n\nA. Donor (rootstock): SUC2:FT with mature leaves retained. Recipient (scion): ft-10 with all scion leaves removed after graft union to isolate the SAM. Grow the composite entirely under SD ($8$ h light/$16$ h dark) after grafting. Include a negative control graft using SUC2:GUS as donor, all other conditions identical. Outcome criterion: early flowering of the ft-10 scion apex under SD only when grafted to SUC2:FT, and no flowering when grafted to SUC2:GUS, demonstrates that a phloem-produced FT protein moves from donor leaves to the recipient SAM and is sufficient to trigger flowering under noninductive day length.\n\nB. Donor (rootstock): WT with all donor leaves removed immediately after grafting. Recipient (scion): ft-10 with leaves removed. Grow under LD ($16$ h light/$8$ h dark). Outcome criterion: early flowering of the ft-10 scion under LD would be taken to indicate FT mobility from the donor.\n\nC. Donor (rootstock): ft-10. Recipient (scion): CaMV 35S:FT with all scion leaves retained. Grow under SD ($8$ h light/$16$ h dark). Outcome criterion: early flowering of the CaMV 35S:FT scion under SD would be taken to indicate FT mobility.\n\nD. Donor (rootstock): co-9 with mature leaves retained. Recipient (scion): ft-10 with leaves removed. Grow under LD ($16$ h light/$8$ h dark). Outcome criterion: early flowering of the ft-10 scion under LD would be taken to indicate FT mobility from the donor under inductive day length.", "solution": "The problem statement will now be subjected to rigorous validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Hypothesis**: A leaf-produced mobile signal, florigen, moves through the phloem to the shoot apical meristem (SAM) to trigger flowering in long day (LD) plants when day length exceeds a critical threshold.\n- **Candidate Signal**: The protein encoded by the $FLOWERING \\ LOCUS \\ T$ ($FT$) gene in *Arabidopsis thaliana*.\n- **Regulatory Pathway**: Light perception by phytochromes and cryptochromes stabilizes the $CONSTANS$ ($CO$) protein late in the day under $LD$ conditions. $CO$ activates $FT$ transcription in leaves. Under short day ($SD$) conditions, $FT$ transcription is minimal.\n- **Transport Mechanism**: Phloem transport follows pressure-driven mass flow and can carry proteins and RNAs from source leaves to sinks (e.g., SAM).\n- **Experimental Technique**: Grafting to test the movement of leaf-derived signals.\n- **Available Genetic Lines**:\n    - Wild type (WT)\n    - $ft-10$: a loss-of-function mutant in the $FT$ gene.\n    - $co-9$: a loss-of-function mutant in the $CONSTANS$ gene.\n    - $SUC2:FT$: a transgenic line expressing $FT$ from the phloem companion cell-specific *Sucrose transporter 2* promoter.\n    - $SUC2:GUS$: a transgenic promoter control line expressing the GUS reporter gene from the $SUC2$ promoter.\n    - $CaMV \\ 35S:FT$: a transgenic line expressing $FT$ from the constitutive *Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S* promoter.\n- **Experimental Conditions**:\n    - Photoperiods: $LD$ ($16$ h light/$8$ h dark) or $SD$ ($8$ h light/$16$ h dark).\n    - Grafting: Standard epicotyl grafting is possible, creating a donor (rootstock) and a recipient (scion).\n    - Leaf Manipulation: Selective removal or retention of leaves on donor and recipient.\n- **Objective**: Identify the single best experimental design to cleanly demonstrate that $FT$ is a mobile florigen from the leaves that is sufficient to induce flowering at a recipient SAM that cannot produce its own $FT$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated based on the established criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes the well-established $CO$-$FT$ pathway for photoperiodic flowering induction in *Arabidopsis thaliana*. The roles of $CO$, $FT$, phytochromes, cryptochromes, phloem transport, and the use of grafting to study mobile signals are all standard and factual concepts in modern plant biology. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The question is clear and unambiguous. It asks to identify the most robust experimental design from a given set of options to test a specific, well-defined hypothesis. The provided genetic tools and techniques are appropriate for addressing this question, and a unique best answer can be determined through logical deduction based on established biological principles.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, technical language common to genetics and molecular biology. There are no subjective, opinion-based, or ambiguous statements.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides all necessary information. The genotypes are defined by their function (loss-of-function, specific promoter expression, constitutive expression), which is sufficient for designing the experiment. The experimental conditions are clearly specified. There are no internal contradictions.\n- **Realism**: The proposed experiments, involving grafting of specific *Arabidopsis* mutants and transgenic lines, are standard procedures in plant science research and are entirely feasible.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formulated question in experimental design based on established principles of plant molecular genetics and physiology. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to design an experiment that unambiguously demonstrates three key properties of the $FT$ protein, as hypothesized:\n1.  **Origin**: It is produced in the leaves (or can be sourced from them).\n2.  **Mobility**: It moves from its site of production (donor tissue) to the shoot apical meristem (recipient tissue).\n3.  **Sufficiency**: Its arrival at the SAM is sufficient to induce flowering, even under conditions that are normally non-inductive.\n\nA \"clean\" experiment must isolate the variable of interest—the mobile $FT$ signal—and control for all other possibilities. This requires:\n- A donor (rootstock) that produces the signal.\n- A recipient (scion) that is incapable of producing the signal itself, so any flowering response is unequivocally due to the received signal. Removing the recipient's own leaves is critical to prevent any endogenous signal production, however minimal.\n- A method to demonstrate that the signal is sufficient to bypass normal environmental controls. This is best achieved by showing flowering induction under non-inductive photoperiods.\n- An appropriate negative control to ensure the observed effect is specific to the signal molecule and not an artifact of the experimental procedure.\n\nWith these principles, each option is evaluated.\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\n\n- **Design**: Donor is $SUC2:FT$ (leaves retained); recipient is $ft-10$ (leaves removed); conditions are $SD$ ($8$ h light). A control graft uses a $SUC2:GUS$ donor.\n- **Evaluation**:\n    - **Signal Source**: The $SUC2:FT$ donor expresses $FT$ protein directly in the phloem companion cells of the leaves. This is a perfect source for a mobile signal intended for phloem transport. Retaining donor leaves is correct.\n    - **Recipient**: The $ft-10$ recipient is a loss-of-function mutant and cannot produce any $FT$ protein. Removing its leaves ensures that the SAM is isolated and can only respond to a signal arriving from the donor. This is an excellent choice.\n    - **Test of Sufficiency**: The experiment is conducted under $SD$ conditions. $Arabidopsis$ is a long-day plant and does not flower under $SD$. If the $ft-10$ scion flowers, it means the arriving signal ($FT$) is sufficient to override the non-inductive photoperiod. This is a very strong test.\n    - **Control**: The $SUC2:GUS$ donor serves as a perfect negative control. The $GUS$ protein is inert with respect to flowering. If this graft does not result in flowering of the $ft-10$ scion, it proves that the flowering observed with the $SUC2:FT$ donor is specifically due to the $FT$ protein and not the grafting procedure, the activity of the $SUC2$ promoter, or some other non-specific mobile factor.\n- **Conclusion**: This experimental design is impeccable. It directly tests origin (from donor phloem), mobility (grafting to a non-producing recipient), and sufficiency (induction under $SD$). The control is rigorous. The predicted outcome provides unambiguous support for the hypothesis.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\n\n- **Design**: Donor is WT (leaves removed); recipient is $ft-10$ (leaves removed); conditions are $LD$ ($16$ h light).\n- **Evaluation**: The problem states that the mobile signal is *leaf-produced*. By removing the leaves from the WT donor, the primary source of the $FT$ signal is eliminated. While some residual production might occur in other tissues, the design is fundamentally flawed as it fails to test the leaf-derived nature of the signal. The experiment cannot proceed without a source of the signal to be tested.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\n\n- **Design**: Donor is $ft-10$; recipient is $CaMV \\ 35S:FT$ (leaves retained); conditions are $SD$ ($8$ h light).\n- **Evaluation**: This design contains two fatal flaws.\n    1.  **Signal Source**: The donor is an $ft-10$ mutant, which cannot produce $FT$ protein. There is no signal to be transported.\n    2.  **Recipient**: The recipient is a $CaMV \\ 35S:FT$ line. The $35S$ promoter is constitutive, meaning $FT$ is expressed in all cells of the plant, including the SAM, at all times. This plant will flower early regardless of photoperiod or any signal from a graft partner.\n    - The experiment is therefore nonsensical. The expected outcome (early flowering of the scion) will occur, but it has absolutely no connection to signal mobility from the donor. The conclusion drawn would be a non-sequitur.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n\n- **Design**: Donor is $co-9$ (leaves retained); recipient is $ft-10$ (leaves removed); conditions are $LD$ ($16$ h light).\n- **Evaluation**:\n    - **Signal Source**: The donor is a $co-9$ loss-of-function mutant. As stated in the problem, a functional $CO$ protein is required to activate $FT$ transcription under $LD$ conditions. Therefore, a $co-9$ mutant cannot produce the $FT$ signal, even under inductive $LD$s. This donor is a non-producer.\n    - **Experiment**: The experiment grafts a non-producing donor to a non-producing recipient. No flowering signal will be transmitted, and the $ft-10$ scion will not flower. This experiment is designed to yield a negative result. While it could serve as a valuable control to demonstrate that $CO$ is required in the donor leaves to produce the mobile signal, it does not itself demonstrate that $FT$ *is* that mobile signal. The question asks for the design that *demonstrates FT mobility and sufficiency*. This design fails to do so.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Final Summary**\n\nOption A provides the most robust and unambiguous experimental test. It uses a specific phloem-promoter to drive expression of the candidate signal ($FT$), a recipient that cannot make the signal ($ft-10$), conditions to test for sufficiency (non-inductive $SD$ photoperiod), and a rigorous negative control ($SUC2:GUS$). The other options are critically flawed in their logic and design.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2825098"}]}
