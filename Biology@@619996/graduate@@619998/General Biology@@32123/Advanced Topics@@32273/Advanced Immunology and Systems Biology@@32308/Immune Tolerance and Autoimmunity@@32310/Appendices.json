The model is based on probabilistic principles and specific biological assumptions. We begin by formalizing the problem statement.\n\nLet $k$ be the number of distinct self-antigens presented. Let $s$ be the probability that the T cell clone recognizes a single, specific self-antigen. The problem states that $0 < s < 1$. The recognition events for different antigens are independent. Deletion of the clone occurs if and only if it recognizes at least one of the $k$ presented antigens.\n\nLet $P_{\\text{del}}(k)$ denote the probability of deletion when $k$ antigens are present. Calculating the probability of recognizing \"at least one\" antigen directly is cumbersome. It is more efficient to apply the complement rule, as suggested by the problem statement.\n\nThe complement of the event \"recognizing at least one antigen\" is the event \"recognizing zero antigens\".\nThe probability of recognizing a single antigen is $s$. Therefore, the probability of *not* recognizing a single antigen is $1-s$.\n\nGiven that there are $k$ distinct antigens and the recognition events are independent, the probability of not recognizing any of them is the product of the individual probabilities of not recognizing each one.\nLet $E_0$ be the event of not recognizing any of the $k$ antigens.\n$$ P(E_0) = \\prod_{i=1}^{k} (1 - s) $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ P(E_0) = (1 - s)^{k} $$\nThe probability of deletion, $P_{\\text{del}}(k)$, is the probability of the complementary event to $E_0$:\n$$ P_{\\text{del}}(k) = 1 - P(E_0) = 1 - (1 - s)^{k} $$\nThis general formula gives the deletion probability for any number of antigens $k$.\n\nWe must now consider the two scenarios defined in the problem.\nBefore the action of Autoimmune Regulator (AIRE), the number of distinct self-antigens is $N$.

This is the difference between the final and initial probabilities:\n$$ \\Delta P_{\\text{del}} = P_{\\text{del}}(N + \\Delta N) - P_{\\text{del}}(N) $$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$ \\Delta P_{\\text{del}} = \\left( 1 - (1 - s)^{N + \\Delta N} \\right) - \\left( 1 - (1 - s)^{N} \\right) $$\nSimplifying the algebra:\n$$ \\Delta P_{\\text{del}} = 1 - (1 - s)^{N + \\Delta N} - 1 + (1 - s)^{N} $$\n$$ \\Delta P_{\\text{del}} = (1 - s)^{N} - (1 - s)^{N + \\Delta N} $$\nTo obtain a more compact form, we use the property of exponents $x^{a+b} = x^{a}x^{b}$.
