The concepts of Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB), targeted exome sequencing, nonsynonymous mutations, and neoantigen load are central principles in modern tumor immunology and immuno-oncology. The provided numerical values are within plausible ranges. A TMB of $150$ mutations per megabase, derived from $300$ mutations in a $2$ Mb panel, is characteristic of a hypermutated tumor phenotype, which is observed in specific cancer types, for instance, those with mismatch repair deficiency. The neoantigen conversion factor of $c = 0.02$, or $2\\%$, is also consistent with estimates in the scientific literature, which typically range from $1-5\\%$. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and data for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles, is not incomplete or contradictory, and is not trivial. It is a straightforward quantitative application of standard definitions in bioinformatics and cancer biology.\n\nThe verdict is that the problem is valid.

The problem defines TMB as the number of somatic coding nonsynonymous mutations per megabase.\nThe total number of such mutations is given as $N_{mut} = 300$.\nThe size of the genomic region examined is $L = 2$ Mb.\nTherefore, the TMB is calculated as the ratio of these two quantities:\n$$\n\\text{TMB} = \\frac{N_{mut}}{L}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\text{TMB} = \\frac{300}{2} = 150 \\text{ mutations/Mb}\n$$\n\nThe second quantity to compute is the expected total neoantigen load.\nLet $M_i$ be the $i$-th nonsynonymous mutation, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 300\\}$.\nLet $X_i$ be the random variable representing the number of immunogenic neoantigenic peptides yielded by mutation $M_i$.\nThe problem states that on average, each mutation yields $c$ neoantigens. This is the expected value of $X_i$:\n$$\nE[X_i] = c = 0.02\n$$\nThe total neoantigen load, which we denote as $N_{neo}$, is the sum of the neoantigens produced by all individual mutations:\n$$\nN_{neo} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{mut}} X_i\n$$\nThe problem asks for the expected total neoantigen load, $E[N_{neo}]$. By the linearity of expectation, the expected value of a sum of random variables is the sum of their expected values. This property holds regardless of whether the variables are independent.\n$$\nE[N_{neo}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{mut}} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{mut}} E[X_i]\n$$\nSince the expected number of neoantigens is the same for each mutation, $E[X_i] = c$ for all $i$, we can simplify the sum:\n$$\nE[N_{neo}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{mut}} c = N_{mut} \\times c\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $N_{mut} = 300$ and $c = 0.02$:\n$$\nE[N_{neo}] = 300 \\times 0.02 = 6\n$$\nThe expected total neoantigen load is a unitless count of $6$.\n\nThe two required values are the TMB and the expected neoantigen load.\nTMB is $150$ mutations/Mb.\nExpected neoantigen load is $6$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 150 & 6 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2847250"}, {"introduction": "While a high total neoantigen load suggests immunogenic potential, the actual immune response depends on the effective presentation of individual peptides.

The assumptions are consistent with one another and serve to isolate the effect of binding affinity ($K_d$) on immunogenicity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is deemed **valid**. It presents a standard, albeit simplified, model of competitive peptide binding to MHC molecules, which is a common exercise in quantitative immunology. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe core of the problem lies in applying the law of mass action to the equilibrium binding of peptides $E_1$ and $E_2$ to MHC molecules. Let $P_1$ and $P_2$ represent the free peptides, $M$ represent the free MHC molecules (HLA-A*02:01), and $C_1$ and $C_2$ represent the respective peptide-MHC complexes.\n\nThe binding reactions at equilibrium are:\n$$ P_1 + M \\rightleftharpoons C_1 $$\n$$ P_2 + M \\rightleftharpoons C_2 $$\n\nThe dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined for each reaction as:\n$$ K_{d1} = \\frac{[P_1][M]}{[C_1]} = 50\\,\\mathrm{nM} $$\n$$ K_{d2} = \\frac{[P_2][M]}{[C_2]} = 500\\,\\mathrm{nM} $$\n\nHere, $[X]$ denotes the equilibrium concentration of species $X$. We must determine the ratio of the formed complexes, which is equivalent to the ratio of their surface densities or \"occupancy.\" Rearranging the equations for the concentration of the complexes, we get:\n$$ [C_1] = \\frac{[P_1][M]}{K_{d1}} $$\n$$ [C_2] = \\frac{[P_2][M]}{K_{d2}} $$\n\nThe problem states that the concentrations of free peptides available for loading are equal, so $[P_1] = [P_2]$. Both peptides compete for the same pool of MHC molecules, so the concentration of free MHC molecules, $[M]$, is the same for both equilibria.\n\nWe can now compute the ratio of the concentrations of the two complexes:\n$$ \\frac{[C_1]}{[C_2]} = \\frac{\\frac{[P_1][M]}{K_{d1}}}{\\frac{[P_2][M]}{K_{d2}}} $$\n\nSince $[P_1] = [P_2]$ and $[M]$ is common to both terms, they cancel out, yielding:\n$$ \\frac{[C_1]}{[C_2]} = \\frac{K_{d2}}{K_{d1}} $$\n\nSubstituting the given values for the dissociation constants:\n$$ \\frac{[C_1]}{[C_2]} = \\frac{500\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{50\\,\\mathrm{nM}} = 10 $$\n\nThis result indicates that the steady-state concentration (and number) of $E_1$-MHC complexes is $10$ times greater than that of $E_2$-MHC complexes. According to the problem's explicit assumption that T cell activation is a monotonic function of the number of pMHC complexes, a higher number of $E_1$-MHC complexes will lead to a stronger T cell response. The assumption of similar TCR affinity distributions and precursor frequencies ensures that the differential response is driven by the number of presented complexes, not by differences in the responding T cell populations. Therefore, the epitope $E_1$ will dominate the CD8$^{+}$ T cell response.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n- **A. $E_1$ dominates; at equal peptide availability its HLA occupancy is approximately $10$-fold higher than $E_2$, so it elicits a stronger CD$8$ response.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with the derivation. The calculated ratio of occupancy $[C_1]/[C_2]$ is exactly $10$. A lower $K_d$ signifies higher binding affinity, leading to greater occupancy at equilibrium. Given the problem's assumptions, this directly translates to a stronger immune response.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. $E_2$ dominates; weaker binding (higher $K_d$) increases complex turnover and serial engagement, yielding a stronger CD$8$ response despite lower occupancy.**\nThis argument invokes the concept of serial TCR engagement, a kinetic phenomenon where a single pMHC complex with a fast off-rate (related to high $K_d$) might engage and activate multiple T cells. However, this contradicts a direct and explicit assumption of the problem: \"Activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes depends monotonically on the number of peptide–MHC complexes at the cell surface.\" This assumption mandates that the response strength is determined by the steady-state number of complexes, not their turnover rate or other kinetic properties. The problem must be solved within its own stated constraints.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. Neither epitope dominates; equal transcript expression guarantees equal CD$8$ responses regardless of $K_d$.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. It incorrectly assumes that equal peptide production ($[P_1] = [P_2]$) leads to equal surface presentation ($[C_1] = [C_2]$). Our derivation based on the law of mass action demonstrates that this is not the case; the binding affinity, quantified by $K_d$, is a critical determinant of the number of stable pMHC complexes formed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. Dominance cannot be inferred from $K_d$ under these conditions; without knowing TCR affinities, no quantitative prediction is possible.**\nThis statement is invalidated by an explicit assumption in the problem statement: \"Similar distributions of T Cell Receptor (TCR) affinity and precursor frequency across T cells specific for $E_1$ and $E_2$.\" This crucial condition is provided precisely so that the variable of TCR affinity can be factored out, allowing for a prediction based solely on the upstream events of peptide presentation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2847261"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the static properties of neoantigen generation and presentation, we can now integrate these ideas into a dynamic, systems-level view of the tumor-immune battle.

We will proceed by first constructing the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), then analyzing its equilibria and stability properties as specified.\n\nFirst, we establish the system of ODEs based on the given principles.\n\nThe rate of change of the tumor population, $\\frac{dT}{dt}$, is governed by two opposing effects. First, tumor proliferation is described as resource-limited, with a per capita growth rate that decreases linearly with the population size $T$. This is characteristic of logistic growth, mathematically represented as $rT \\left(1 - \\frac{T}{K}\\right)$, where $r > 0$ is the intrinsic tumor growth rate and $K > 0$ is the carrying capacity of the tumor's microenvironment. Second, tumor cells are eliminated by effector cells. This \"immune-mediated tumor cell killing\" is described as an \"encounter-limited\" process, where the rate of killing is proportional to the product of the two populations, $TE$. This is a mass-action kinetics term, which we write as $-\\kappa TE$, where $\\kappa > 0$ represents the killing efficacy or rate constant. Combining these terms gives the first ODE:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dt} = rT \\left(1 - \\frac{T}{K}\\right) - \\kappa T E $$\n\nThe rate of change of the effector cell population, $\\frac{dE}{dt}$, is determined by influx and clearance. Effector cells are supplied from lymphoid tissues through two mechanisms: a \"constant basal influx\", represented by a source term $\\sigma \\ge 0$, and an additional \"recruitment in proportion to the tumor burden\", which translates to a term $\\rho T$, where $\\rho > 0$ is the tumor-driven recruitment coefficient. The effector cells are also \"cleared at a rate proportional to their abundance\", which corresponds to a first-order decay term $-\\mu E$, where $\\mu > 0$ is the clearance rate. The combination of these terms gives the second ODE:\n$$ \\frac{dE}{dt} = \\sigma + \\rho T - \\mu E $$\n\nThe complete autonomous planar system is thus:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dt} = rT - \\frac{r}{K}T^2 - \\kappa T E $$\n$$ \\frac{dE}{dt} = \\sigma + \\rho T - \\mu E $$\nFor the system to be biologically meaningful, we require $T \\ge 0$ and $E \\ge 0$.\n\nNext, we identify the biologically admissible equilibria $(\\bar{T}, \\bar{E})$ by setting both time derivatives to zero:\n$$ \\bar{T} \\left(r - \\frac{r}{K}\\bar{T} - \\kappa \\bar{E}\\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\sigma + \\rho \\bar{T} - \\mu \\bar{E} = 0 $$\nThe first equation presents two possibilities.\n\nCase 1: $\\bar{T} = 0$. Substituting this into the second equation yields $\\sigma - \\mu \\bar{E} = 0$, which gives $\\bar{E} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu}$. This defines the **tumor-free equilibrium**, $P_0 = \\left(0, \\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu}\\right)$. This equilibrium is always biologically admissible, provided $\\sigma \\ge 0$ and $\\mu > 0$.\n\nCase 2: $\\bar{T} \\ne 0$. This implies $r - \\frac{r}{K}\\bar{T} - \\kappa \\bar{E} = 0$. From the second equilibrium equation, we express $\\bar{E}$ as $\\bar{E} = \\frac{\\sigma + \\rho \\bar{T}}{\\mu}$. Substituting this expression into the condition from the first equation:\n$$ r - \\frac{r}{K}\\bar{T} - \\kappa \\left(\\frac{\\sigma + \\rho \\bar{T}}{\\mu}\\right) = 0 $$\nWe rearrange the terms to solve for $\\bar{T}$:\n$$ r - \\frac{\\kappa \\sigma}{\\mu} = \\bar{T} \\left(\\frac{r}{K} + \\frac{\\kappa \\rho}{\\mu}\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{r\\mu - \\kappa\\sigma}{\\mu} = \\bar{T} \\left(\\frac{r\\mu + \\kappa\\rho K}{K\\mu}\\right) $$\n$$ \\bar{T} = \\frac{K(r\\mu - \\kappa\\sigma)}{r\\mu + \\rho\\kappa K} $$\nFor this **tumor-bearing equilibrium** to be biologically admissible and distinct from $P_0$, we must have $\\bar{T} > 0$. Since all parameters are positive, the denominator $r\\mu + \\rho\\kappa K$ is always positive. Therefore, the existence condition is that the numerator must be positive: $r\\mu - \\kappa\\sigma > 0$, or $r\\mu > \\kappa\\sigma$. When this condition is met, the corresponding effector cell population $\\bar{E} = \\frac{\\sigma + \\rho \\bar{T}}{\\mu}$ is also positive.\n\nNow, we analyze the local stability of the tumor-free equilibrium $P_0 = (0, \\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu})$ by linearizing the system. The Jacobian matrix $J$ of the system is:\n$$ J(T, E) = \\begin{pmatrix} r - \\frac{2r}{K}T - \\kappa E & -\\kappa T \\\\ \\rho & -\\mu \\end{pmatrix} $$\nEvaluating this matrix at the equilibrium point $P_0$:\n$$ J(P_0) = \\begin{pmatrix} r - \\frac{2r}{K}(0) - \\kappa \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu}\\right) & -\\kappa (0) \\\\ \\rho & -\\mu \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} r - \\frac{\\kappa\\sigma}{\\mu} & 0 \\\\ \\rho & -\\mu \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe eigenvalues $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$ of this lower triangular matrix are its diagonal entries:\n$$ \\lambda_1 = r - \\frac{\\kappa\\sigma}{\\mu} $$\n$$ \\lambda_2 = -\\mu $$\nFor local asymptotic stability, the real parts of all eigenvalues must be negative. Since $\\mu > 0$, we have $\\lambda_2 < 0$, which is always satisfied. The stability condition thus depends entirely on the sign of $\\lambda_1$. We require $\\lambda_1 < 0$:\n$$ r - \\frac{\\kappa\\sigma}{\\mu} < 0 \\implies r < \\frac{\\kappa\\sigma}{\\mu} \\implies r\\mu < \\kappa\\sigma $$\nThis inequality gives the condition for the tumor-free equilibrium to be locally asymptotically stable. This represents a state of successful immune surveillance where nascent tumors are eliminated.\n\nFinally, we derive the critical immune killing efficacy, $\\kappa_c$. This is the threshold value of $\\kappa$ at which the stability of the tumor-free equilibrium changes. This corresponds to a bifurcation point, which occurs when the dominant eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ crosses zero. We find $\\kappa_c$ by setting $\\lambda_1 = 0$:\n$$ r - \\frac{\\kappa_c\\sigma}{\\mu} = 0 $$\nSolving for $\\kappa_c$ yields:\n$$ \\kappa_c \\sigma = r\\mu \\implies \\kappa_c = \\frac{r\\mu}{\\sigma} $$\nThis critical value separates two distinct regimes. If $\\kappa > \\kappa_c$, the tumor-free equilibrium is stable. If $\\kappa < \\kappa_c$, it is unstable, and the tumor-bearing equilibrium $P_1$ exists and is typically stable, signifying tumor escape.\nIt is important to observe that the expression for $\\kappa_c$ does not depend on the parameters $K$ and $\\rho$. The carrying capacity $K$ is associated with the term $-\\frac{r}{K}T^2$, which is of second order in $T$. In a local stability analysis around $T=0$, such higher-order terms vanish, so $K$ does not influence the stability of the tumor-free state. The recruitment coefficient $\\rho$ appears in the Jacobian, but in the off-diagonal term $J_{21}$. Because the term $J_{12} = -\\kappa T$ is zero at the tumor-free equilibrium, the Jacobian matrix becomes triangular, and its eigenvalues are independent of the off-diagonal elements. Therefore, the stability threshold for eradicating an infinitesimal tumor depends only on the tumor's intrinsic growth rate $r$, the basal immune cell population (determined by $\\sigma$ and $\\mu$), and the killing efficacy $\\kappa$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{r\\mu}{\\sigma}}$$", "id": "2847225"}]}
