To meet this high energy demand, cells can employ different metabolic strategies, such as complete glucose oxidation via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) or a high rate of aerobic glycolysis. This exercise [@problem_id:2808683] provides a quantitative foundation for understanding these choices by challenging you to calculate the precise glucose requirement for a T cell under two distinct metabolic programs. Mastering this calculation will solidify your understanding of ATP yields and the bioenergetic costs associated with different metabolic states.", "problem": "An activated cytotoxic T lymphocyte maintains a constant adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis rate of $R_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = 1.00 \\times 10^{9}$ ATP molecules per second per cell. Glucose is the only carbon source. You will estimate the minimal glucose uptake rate required to meet this ATP demand under two metabolic programs relevant to immunometabolism.\n\nBiochemical bases to use:\n- Glycolysis yields a net of $2$ ATP per glucose via substrate-level phosphorylation in the cytosol.\n- Complete oxidation of $1$ glucose to $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ yields reducing equivalents as follows: $2$ cytosolic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) from glycolysis, $2$ mitochondrial NADH from pyruvate dehydrogenase, $6$ mitochondrial NADH and $2$ mitochondrial flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH$_{2}$) from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and $2$ ATP equivalents from TCA cycle substrate-level phosphorylation (guanosine triphosphate).\n- The mitochondrial phosphorylation-to-oxygen ratio is $P/O = 2.5$ for NADH and $1.5$ for FADH$_{2}$. Cytosolic NADH is reoxidized via the malate–aspartate shuttle without loss, yielding the same $P/O$ as mitochondrial NADH.\n- For the purpose of attributing ATP shares by mechanism, define “glycolytic ATP” as ATP made by cytosolic glycolytic substrate-level phosphorylation, and group all other ATP (oxidative phosphorylation plus mitochondrial substrate-level phosphorylation) into the “oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-associated” pool.\n\nTwo metabolic programs:\n1) Pure oxidative phosphorylation program: all glucose taken up is fully oxidized to $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.\n2) Mixed program: the cell enforces that a fraction $0.70$ of total ATP production arises from glycolytic substrate-level phosphorylation, and a fraction $0.30$ arises from the OXPHOS-associated pool. Assume the fraction of glucose routed to the OXPHOS-associated pool is fully oxidized, while the remainder is reduced to lactate to maintain redox balance.\n\nTasks:\n- Starting from the biochemical bases above, derive the ATP yield per glucose under full oxidation and under the mixed program constraint.\n- Compute the minimal glucose uptake rates $v_{\\mathrm{glc,OX}}$ (pure oxidative phosphorylation program) and $v_{\\mathrm{glc,mix}}$ (mixed program) required to meet $R_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$.\n- Express both uptake rates in molecules per second per cell.\n- Round each result to four significant figures.\n\nProvide your final answer as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} v_{\\mathrm{glc,OX}} & v_{\\mathrm{glc,mix}} \\end{pmatrix}$.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It provides all necessary information for a unique solution based on established principles of biochemistry. Therefore, I will proceed with a full derivation of the solution.\n\nThe central task is to determine the glucose uptake rate, $v_{\\mathrm{glc}}$, required to sustain a constant rate of ATP hydrolysis, $R_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$, under two distinct metabolic scenarios. The relationship is given by:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{glc}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{ATP}}}{Y_{\\mathrm{ATP}}}$$\nwhere $Y_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$ is the yield of ATP molecules per molecule of glucose for a given metabolic program.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the ATP yield for the complete oxidation of one molecule of glucose. This serves as the basis for both scenarios. Let us denote this yield as $Y_{\\mathrm{ATP,OX}}$. We sum the contributions from substrate-level phosphorylation (SLP) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS).\n\nThe stoichiometry for the complete oxidation of $1$ molecule of glucose is as follows:\n1.  **Glycolysis**: Produces a net of $2$ ATP via SLP and $2$ cytosolic NADH.\n2.  **Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex**: Converts $2$ pyruvate to $2$ acetyl-CoA, producing $2$ mitochondrial NADH.\n3.  **Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) Cycle**: For $2$ turns (from $1$ glucose), produces $2$ GTP (equivalent to $2$ ATP) via SLP, $6$ mitochondrial NADH, and $2$ mitochondrial FADH$_{2}$.\n\nThe total count of reducing equivalents is:\n- Total NADH = $2$ (glycolysis) $+ 2$ (PDH) $+ 6$ (TCA) = $10$ NADH.\n- Total FADH$_{2}$ = $2$ (TCA).\n\nThe problem specifies the phosphorylation-to-oxygen ($P/O$) ratios are $2.5$ for NADH and $1.5$ for FADH$_{2}$. It is also given that cytosolic NADH is reoxidized via the malate-aspartate shuttle without energy loss, thus yielding the same amount of ATP as mitochondrial NADH.\n\nThe ATP produced from OXPHOS is:\n$$Y_{\\mathrm{OXPHOS}} = (10 \\text{ NADH} \\times 2.5 \\frac{\\text{ATP}}{\\text{NADH}}) + (2 \\text{ FADH}_2 \\times 1.5 \\frac{\\text{ATP}}{\\text{FADH}_2}) = 25 \\text{ ATP} + 3 \\text{ ATP} = 28 \\text{ ATP}$$\n\nThe total ATP yield from complete oxidation, $Y_{\\mathrm{ATP,OX}}$, is the sum of ATP from SLP and OXPHOS:\n$$Y_{\\mathrm{ATP,OX}} = (\\text{ATP from Glycolysis SLP}) + (\\text{ATP from TCA SLP}) + Y_{\\mathrm{OXPHOS}}$$\n$$Y_{\\mathrm{ATP,OX}} = 2 \\text{ ATP} + 2 \\text{ ATP} + 28 \\text{ ATP} = 32 \\text{ ATP per glucose}$$\n\nFor analytical clarity in the second part of the problem, we must categorize this yield according to the problem's definitions:\n- **Glycolytic ATP**: $2$ ATP from glycolytic SLP.\n- **OXPHOS-associated ATP**: All other ATP, which is $(2 \\text{ ATP from TCA SLP}) + (28 \\text{ ATP from OXPHOS}) = 30$ ATP.\nThe total sum is $2 + 30 = 32$ ATP, which is consistent.\n\n**Program 1: Pure Oxidative Phosphorylation Program**\nIn this program, all glucose is fully oxidized. The glucose uptake rate, $v_{\\mathrm{glc,OX}}$, is calculated using the total yield $Y_{\\mathrm{ATP,OX}}$.\nGiven $R_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = 1.00 \\times 10^9$ ATP molecules/s.\n$$v_{\\mathrm{glc,OX}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{ATP}}}{Y_{\\mathrm{ATP,OX}}} = \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^9 \\text{ s}^{-1}}{32} = 3.125 \\times 10^7 \\text{ molecules s}^{-1}$$\n\n**Program 2: Mixed Program**\nIn this program, the cell maintains a specific ratio of ATP production sources: $70\\%$ from glycolytic ATP and $30\\%$ from OXPHOS-associated ATP. A fraction of glucose is fully oxidized, and the remainder is converted to lactate.\n\nLet $v_{\\mathrm{glc,mix}}$ be the total glucose uptake rate. For every molecule of glucose that enters the cell, it generates $2$ ATP via glycolytic SLP, regardless of whether it is subsequently oxidized or converted to lactate. Therefore, the total rate of \"Glycolytic ATP\" production, $R_{\\mathrm{glyc}}$, is directly proportional to the total glucose uptake rate:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{glyc}} = v_{\\mathrm{glc,mix}} \\times 2 \\frac{\\text{ATP}}{\\text{glucose}}$$\nThe problem states that this must constitute a fraction $f_{\\mathrm{glyc}} = 0.70$ of the total ATP production rate, $R_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$.\n$$R_{\\mathrm{glyc}} = f_{\\mathrm{glyc}} \\times R_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$$\n$$2 \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{glc,mix}} = 0.70 \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$$\nWe can directly solve for the required glucose uptake rate, $v_{\\mathrm{glc,mix}}$:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{glc,mix}} = \\frac{0.70 \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{ATP}}}{2} = 0.35 \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$$\nSubstituting the value for $R_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{glc,mix}} = 0.35 \\times (1.00 \\times 10^9 \\text{ s}^{-1}) = 3.5 \\times 10^8 \\text{ molecules s}^{-1}$$\n\nTo verify this, we can determine the effective ATP yield per glucose, $Y_{\\mathrm{ATP,mix}}$, under this program.\n$$Y_{\\mathrm{ATP,mix}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{ATP}}}{v_{\\mathrm{glc,mix}}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{ATP}}}{0.35 \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{ATP}}} = \\frac{1}{0.35} = \\frac{1}{7/20} = \\frac{20}{7} \\text{ ATP per glucose}$$\nThe remaining $30\\%$ of ATP must come from the OXPHOS-associated pool. Let $x$ be the fraction of glucose molecules that are fully oxidized. The rate of production of OXPHOS-associated ATP is due only to this fraction, and the yield is $30$ ATP per oxidized glucose.\n$$R_{\\mathrm{oxphos\\_assoc}} = (x \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{glc,mix}}) \\times 30 \\frac{\\text{ATP}}{\\text{glucose}} = 0.30 \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$$\nSubstituting $v_{\\mathrm{glc,mix}} = 0.35 \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$:\n$$(x \\cdot 0.35 \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{ATP}}) \\times 30 = 0.30 \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$$\n$$10.5 \\cdot x = 0.30 \\implies x = \\frac{0.30}{10.5} = \\frac{1}{35}$$\nThus, only a fraction $x = 1/35$ of incoming glucose is fully oxidized, while the fraction $1 - x = 34/35$ is converted to lactate. The overall ATP yield is consistent with this partitioning:\n$$Y_{\\mathrm{ATP,mix}} = \\left( (1-x) \\times 2 \\right) + \\left( x \\times 32 \\right) = \\left(\\frac{34}{35} \\times 2\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{35} \\times 32\\right) = \\frac{68+32}{35} = \\frac{100}{35} = \\frac{20}{7}$$\nThis confirms the validity of our direct calculation for $v_{\\mathrm{glc,mix}}$.\n\nThe problem requires rounding each result to four significant figures.\n$v_{\\mathrm{glc,OX}} = 3.125 \\times 10^7$. This value is exact and has four significant figures.\n$v_{\\mathrm{glc,mix}} = 3.5 \\times 10^8$. To express this with four significant figures, it is $3.500 \\times 10^8$.\n\nThe final results are:\n$v_{\\mathrm{glc,OX}} = 3.125 \\times 10^7$ molecules s$^{-1}$ per cell.\n$v_{\\mathrm{glc,mix}} = 3.500 \\times 10^8$ molecules s$^{-1}$ per cell.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} 3.125 \\times 10^7 & 3.500 \\times 10^8 \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2808683"}, {"introduction": "Building on the theoretical basis of cellular bioenergetics, we now turn to experimental practice.

Oxygen Consumption Rate (OCR) and Extracellular Acidification Rate (ECAR) traces are recorded under sequential injections of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase inhibitor oligomycin and the complex I and III inhibitors rotenone and antimycin A, respectively. The following foundational definitions are assumed: (i) basal respiration represents mitochondrial oxygen consumption after subtracting non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption, which is revealed after inhibition of complexes I and III, (ii) ATP-linked respiration is the component of basal oxygen consumption that is sensitive to ATP synthase inhibition, and (iii) coupling efficiency is the fraction of basal respiration that is devoted to ATP synthesis by the mitochondrial ATP synthase. These are standard, well-tested definitions in bioenergetics for interpreting such assays.\n\nTwo conditions are compared: vehicle-treated control and metformin-treated.

From immunometabolic principles, effector T cells rely heavily on aerobic glycolysis for rapid cytokine production and cytotoxic function under nutrient-replete conditions, while mitochondrial respiration supports bioenergetic flexibility, mitochondrial ATP supply in specific subcellular locales, calcium homeostasis, and sustained effector functions. The observed decrease in coupling efficiency suggests impaired mitochondrial ATP generation capacity, which may dampen sustained effector functions and reduce efficiency under stress, even as increased glycolysis may partially preserve acute effector outputs. Therefore, the net expectation is a partial impairment of mitochondrial support for effector function with glycolytic compensation; acutely, some effector activities may be maintained, but overall effector potency and durability are likely reduced, with a potential shift toward a more memory-like metabolic profile over time driven by Adenosine Monophosphate-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) activation and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) restraint.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{4}{33}}$$", "id": "2808728"}, {"introduction": "Metabolism is more than just a power source for immune cells; it is an active regulator of their fate and function.

The metabolic dichotomy between effector Th$17$ cells (glycolytic, anabolic) and regulatory Treg cells (oxidative, catabolic) is a central concept in the field. The role of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) and its product, malonyl-coenzyme A, as a critical node regulating both fatty acid synthesis (FAS) and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is factually correct. Malonyl-coenzyme A is the substrate for FAS and the allosteric inhibitor of CPT$1$, the gatekeeper enzyme for mitochondrial FAO. The scenario described is a standard experimental design used to probe these pathways.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear set of initial conditions, a specific intervention, and a well-defined set of \"foundational facts\" to be used for reasoning. It asks for a logical prediction based on these premises, for which a unique and meaningful solution can be derived.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is precise, technical, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It is valid. The solution will now proceed.\n\n**Principle-Based Derivation**\nThe problem requires predicting the net effect of an ACC1 inhibitor on the balance between Th$17$ and Treg differentiation. The inhibitor has a dual effect stemming from its primary action of reducing the synthesis of malonyl-coenzyme A from acetyl-coenzyme A.\n\n$1$. **Inhibition of De Novo Fatty Acid Synthesis (FAS)**: ACC1 catalyzes the committed step of FAS. By inhibiting ACC1, the production of malonyl-coenzyme A, the primary building block for new fatty acids, is blocked.\n\n$2$. **Promotion of Fatty Acid $\\beta$-Oxidation (FAO)**: Malonyl-coenzyme A acts as an allosteric inhibitor of CPT1, the enzyme that transports long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for oxidation. By lowering the concentration of malonyl-coenzyme A, the inhibitor effectively removes this brake on CPT1, thereby promoting FAO.\n\nNow we analyze the consequences of these two effects on each T cell lineage, based on the provided foundational facts.\n\n- **Effect on Th$17$ Differentiation**: Foundational fact (i) states that Th$17$ cells rely on FAS to support their anabolic needs for proliferation and effector function. The ACC1 inhibitor directly blocks this essential pathway. The culture medium does not contain supplemental lipids, and physiological levels are often insufficient to support the rapid membrane biogenesis required by proliferating effector T cells. Therefore, inhibiting FAS is expected to severely impair the differentiation, proliferation, and survival of Th$17$ cells. The frequency of Th$17$ cells should decrease.\n\n- **Effect on Treg Differentiation**: Foundational fact (ii) states that Treg cells preferentially rely on FAO. The ACC1 inhibitor promotes FAO by relieving CPT1 inhibition. This enhancement of their preferred metabolic pathway should provide a selective advantage for Treg cells, supporting their differentiation and function. Therefore, the frequency of Treg cells should increase.\n\n- **Synthesis**: The ACC1 inhibitor imposes a metabolic selection pressure. It simultaneously cripples the metabolic program essential for Th$17$ cells (FAS) while enhancing the metabolic program that supports Treg cells (FAO). The expected outcome is a shift in the differentiation balance away from the Th$17$ lineage and towards the Treg lineage.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Th$17$ differentiation decreases while Treg differentiation increases, because de novo fatty acid synthesis is restricted and fatty acid $\\beta$-oxidation is facilitated by lower malonyl-coenzyme A.**\nThis option accurately describes the predicted outcome for both cell types and provides the correct reasoning. The decrease in Th$17$ differentiation is due to the restriction of FAS. The increase in Treg differentiation is due to the facilitation of FAO, resulting from the drop in malonyl-coenzyme A levels. This aligns perfectly with the derivation from first principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Th$17$ differentiation increases while Treg differentiation decreases, because acetyl-coenzyme A accumulates and enhances histone acetylation at Th$17$-associated loci.**\nThis option proposes an alternative mechanism. While ACC1 inhibition can lead to the accumulation of its substrate, acetyl-coenzyme A, and this can influence epigenetics through histone acetylation, this effect is secondary to the primary metabolic blockade. The foundational facts state that Th$17$ cells *rely* on the *product* of the inhibited pathway (FAS), making the direct metabolic impairment the dominant effect. It is biologically inconsistent to propose that crippling an essential anabolic pathway would lead to an increase in differentiation. The prediction is contrary to the logical consequences of the provided metabolic dependencies.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Both Th$17$ and Treg differentiation decrease, because reduced membrane lipid availability limits proliferation required for lineage commitment in both lineages.**\nThis option incorrectly assumes that both lineages are equally dependent on FAS for membrane lipids. The problem explicitly sets up a metabolic dichotomy: Th$17$ cells are anabolic and rely on FAS, whereas Treg cells are catabolic and rely on FAO. This implies that Tregs primarily use exogenous fatty acids as fuel rather than for large-scale de novo synthesis. Therefore, an inhibitor of FAS would not be expected to impact both lineages equally; it should selectively disadvantage the Th$17$ lineage.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. No appreciable change in either Th$17$ or Treg differentiation, because extracellular lipid uptake fully compensates for loss of de novo fatty acid synthesis under the stated conditions.**\nThis option contradicts foundational fact (i), which states that Th$17$ cells *rely* on FAS. If extracellular lipid uptake from physiological concentrations could \"fully compensate,\" this reliance would not exist. The premise of the problem requires accepting that FAS is indeed critical for Th$17$ cell differentiation and proliferation under these conditions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Th$17$ differentiation is unchanged, while Treg differentiation increases modestly due to enhanced fatty acid $\\beta$-oxidation; Th$17$ is spared because it can switch to uptake of exogenous lipids without penalty under the stated conditions.**\nThis option is a variant of option D. It correctly identifies the positive effect on Tregs but incorrectly claims that Th$17$ cells are \"spared\". As in the critique of option D, this negates the foundational fact of Th$17$ reliance on FAS. The assertion that the switch to lipid uptake occurs \"without penalty\" is a strong claim that is not supported by the problem's premises and is generally not true for rapidly proliferating effector T cells.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2808675"}]}
