The roles of the branchpoint, the polypyrimidine tract, the AG dinucleotide, the U2AF complex (U2AF1 and U2AF2), and the competitive nature of splice site selection are accurately represented.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear initial state (weak authentic site), a defined perturbation (insertion of a strong cryptic site), and quantitative data (distances, occupancy folds) that allow for a reasoned prediction based on the provided guiding principles. The question asks for the \"most likely predominant splicing outcome,\" which is a standard way to frame questions about stochastic biological processes.\n- **Objective and Consistent:** The language is objective and precise. The numerical data are internally consistent: the branchpoint is $20$ nt upstream of the cryptic site, which is $10$ nt upstream of the authentic site. This correctly places the branchpoint $20 + 10 = 30$ nt upstream of the authentic site, matching the provided information.\n- **Realism:** The nucleotide distances ($20$ nt, $30$ nt) are well within the typical functional range for branchpoint-to-$3^{\\prime}$-AG spacing in mammalian introns. The creation of a strong cryptic splice site by mutation is a known phenomenon in genetics and disease. The eCLIP data showing differential factor occupancy are a realistic form of experimental evidence.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and well-posed. It provides sufficient information to proceed with a solution based on fundamental principles of splicing.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe central task is to predict which of two competing $3^{\\prime}$ splice sites—the original authentic site and the newly introduced cryptic site—will be predominantly used by the splicing machinery. The guiding principles provided in the problem statement itself direct the analysis. Splice site selection is a competitive process where the site that is more efficiently recognized by the spliceosome will be chosen. The strength of a $3^{\\prime}$ splice site is determined by a combination of sequence elements and their geometry.\n\n1.  **Recognition by U2AF:** The initial recognition of a $3^{\\prime}$ splice site is mediated by the U2AF heterodimer. U2AF2 (also known as U2AF65) binds to the polypyrimidine tract (PPT), and U2AF1 (also known as U2AF35) binds to the terminal AG dinucleotide of the intron. The strength of these interactions is a primary determinant of splice site strength.\n    - **Polypyrimidine Tract (PPT):** The cryptic site's PPT is long and U-rich ($~14$ U's), which is optimal for high-affinity binding by U2AF2. The authentic site's PPT is short ($~6$ U's), indicating a weak interaction.\n    - **U2AF Occupancy:** The experimental eCLIP data provide direct evidence of this differential binding. U2AF2 occupancy is $\\sim 4$-fold higher at the cryptic site, and U2AF1 occupancy is $\\sim 3$-fold higher. This quantitatively confirms that the U2AF complex binds much more strongly to the cryptic site than to the weak authentic site.\n\n2.  **Geometric Constraints:** Productive splicing requires a proper distance between the branchpoint adenosine (A) and the $3^{\\prime}$ splice site AG dinucleotide. The spliceosome must assemble across this region.\n    - **Cryptic Site Geometry:** The distance from the branchpoint A to the cryptic site AG is $20$ nucleotides. This distance is considered optimal for efficient splicing in human cells.\n    - **Authentic Site Geometry:** The distance from the branchpoint A to the authentic site AG is $30$ nucleotides. While this is within the acceptable range (typically $18-40$ nt), it is less optimal than the $20$ nt distance of the cryptic site.\n\n3.  **Competition and Outcome:** The problem explicitly states to use the principle that \"selection favoring sites with higher U2AF occupancy and appropriate geometry.\" Based on the analysis above:\n    - The cryptic site has vastly superior U2AF occupancy (both subunits).\n    - The cryptic site has a more optimal geometric distance from the branchpoint.\n\nBoth key determinants of $3^{\\prime}$ splice site strength unequivocally favor the cryptic site. Therefore, in the competition for the splicing machinery, the cryptic site will be selected predominantly over the authentic site.\n\nThe cryptic site is located $10$ nucleotides *upstream* of the authentic site (i.e., further into the intron). When the spliceosome uses this cryptic site, the splice is made at this upstream position. This means the $10$-nucleotide segment of the intron that lies between the cryptic site and the authentic site will not be removed. Instead, it will be included in the mature mRNA, becoming part of the exon. This results in the exon being extended at its $5^{\\prime}$ end by $10$ nucleotides.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. Predominant selection of the upstream cryptic $3^{\\prime}$ splice site, shifting the exon boundary upstream and yielding an exon extended at its $5^{\\prime}$ end (inclusion of the intronic segment between the cryptic and authentic sites).**\n    This option is the direct consequence of our derivation. The cryptic site is stronger in every molecular aspect presented (PPT quality, U2AF binding, geometry) and will therefore outcompete the weak authentic site. Its upstream location leads to the inclusion of the intervening $10$ nucleotides, extending the exon at its $5^{\\prime}$ terminus.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. No change in exon boundary, because exon definition across the unchanged downstream exon forces use of the original authentic $3^{\\prime}$ splice site despite weaker U2AF occupancy.**\n    This option invokes the concept of exon definition, where splice sites flanking an exon are recognized as a pair. While this mechanism is important, particularly for small exons, it does not represent an absolute rule that cannot be overridden by a dramatically superior competing splice site. The $>3$-fold increase in binding of the core recognition factors (U2AF) to a site with better geometry represents a very strong signal. In splicing, the competition between local splice signals is a dominant force. To assume the original, weak site will be used in the face of a new, vastly superior competitor is biologically untenable. The most predominant outcome will be dictated by the strongest signals.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Increased exon skipping, because the presence of the cryptic $3^{\\prime}$ splice site impairs U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U2 snRNP) recruitment to the branchpoint.**\n    This statement is mechanistically flawed. U2AF binding to the PPT and AG is the event that *recruits* the U2 snRNP to the branchpoint. Given that U2AF binding is substantially *stronger* at the cryptic site region, the recruitment of U2 snRNP to the nearby branchpoint should be enhanced, not impaired. The introduction of a strong site should promote, not inhibit, spliceosome assembly. Therefore, increased exon skipping due to impaired U2 snRNP recruitment is the opposite of what is expected.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Increased intron retention across the upstream intron, because competition between two nearby $3^{\\prime}$ splice sites stalls spliceosome assembly and reduces splicing efficiency at both sites.**\n    While competition between sites of comparable strength can sometimes be non-productive, the scenario here is a competition between a \"strong\" site and a \"weak\" site. Such an imbalance typically results in a decisive 'win' for the stronger site, leading to efficient splicing at that new location. It does not typically lead to a global stalling of the spliceosome and retention of the entire intron. The presence of a strong consensus site is a signal for *efficient* splicing, not its inhibition.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2774578"}, {"introduction": "The final abundance of an mRNA isoform measured in an experiment like RNA-seq reflects a balance between its synthesis and its degradation.

Assuming the number of sequencing reads is directly proportional to mRNA abundance, the PSI can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\text{PSI} = \\frac{N_{\\text{incl}}}{N_{\\text{incl}} + N_{\\text{skip}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for steady-state abundance, the proportionality constant cancels, yielding:\n$$\n\\text{PSI} = \\frac{\\frac{\\alpha_{\\text{incl}}}{\\delta_{\\text{incl}}}}{\\frac{\\alpha_{\\text{incl}}}{\\delta_{\\text{incl}}} + \\frac{\\alpha_{\\text{skip}}}{\\delta_{\\text{skip}}}}\n$$\nWe must now calculate the PSI for the two conditions.\n\n**1. PSI under Control Conditions ($\\text{PSI}_{\\text{control}}$)**\n\nUsing the given parameters for the control condition:\n- $\\alpha_{\\text{incl}} = 10~\\text{min}^{-1}$\n- $\\alpha_{\\text{skip}} = 90~\\text{min}^{-1}$\n- $\\delta_{\\text{incl}} = 0.20~\\text{min}^{-1}$\n- $\\delta_{\\text{skip}} = 0.010~\\text{min}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the terms proportional to the steady-state abundances:\n- $N_{\\text{incl}} \\propto \\frac{\\alpha_{\\text{incl}}}{\\delta_{\\text{incl}}} = \\frac{10}{0.20} = 50$\n- $N_{\\text{skip}} \\propto \\frac{\\alpha_{\\text{skip}}}{\\delta_{\\text{skip}}} = \\frac{90}{0.010} = 9000$\n\nNow, we compute $\\text{PSI}_{\\text{control}}$:\n$$\n\\text{PSI}_{\\text{control}} = \\frac{50}{50 + 9000} = \\frac{50}{9050} \\approx 0.00552\n$$\n\n**2. PSI under UPF1 Knockdown ($\\text{PSI}_{\\text{KD}}$)**\n\nUnder UPF1 knockdown, the synthesis rates are unchanged, but the decay rate of the inclusion isoform is reduced.\n- $\\alpha_{\\text{incl}} = 10~\\text{min}^{-1}$\n- $\\alpha_{\\text{skip}} = 90~\\text{min}^{-1}$\n- $\\delta_{\\text{incl}}' = 0.020~\\text{min}^{-1}$\n- $\\delta_{\\text{skip}} = 0.010~\\text{min}^{-1}$\n\nWe calculate the new steady-state abundances:\n- $N'_{\\text{incl}} \\propto \\frac{\\alpha_{\\text{incl}}}{\\delta'_{\\text{incl}}} = \\frac{10}{0.020} = 500$\n- $N'_{\\text{skip}} \\propto \\frac{\\alpha_{\\text{skip}}}{\\delta_{\\text{skip}}} = \\frac{90}{0.010} = 9000$\n\nNow, we compute $\\text{PSI}_{\\text{KD}}$:\n$$\n\\text{PSI}_{\\text{KD}} = \\frac{500}{500 + 9000} = \\frac{500}{9500} = \\frac{5}{95} = \\frac{1}{19} \\approx 0.0526\n$$\n\n**3. Comparison and Conclusion**\n\nThe PSI increases from approximately $0.0055$ to $0.0526$. To quantify this change, we can compute the ratio:\n$$\\frac{\\text{PSI}_{\\text{KD}}}{\\text{PSI}_{\\text{control}}} \\approx \\frac{0.0526}{0.00552} \\approx 9.53$$\nThis represents an increase of nearly a factor of $10$, which is an order of magnitude. This effect is driven by the stabilization of the inclusion isoform (its decay rate decreases tenfold, from $0.20$ to $0.020~\\text{min}^{-1}$) while its synthesis rate remains constant.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The PSI will increase by approximately an order of magnitude because the inclusion isoform is stabilized when Nonsense-Mediated Decay is impaired, while its production is unchanged.**\n- My calculation shows that PSI increases from $\\approx 0.0055$ to $\\approx 0.0526$, an increase of a factor of $\\approx 9.5$. This is \"approximately an order of magnitude\".\n- The reason for this change is the decrease in the decay rate of the inclusion isoform from $\\delta_{\\text{incl}} = 0.20~\\text{min}^{-1}$ to $\\delta_{\\text{incl}}' = 0.020~\\text{min}^{-1}$ due to NMD impairment, which corresponds to stabilization. The problem states that production ($\\alpha_i$) is unchanged. The reasoning provided in this option is fully consistent with the premises and the derived result.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The PSI will decrease by approximately an order of magnitude because impaired Nonsense-Mediated Decay causes ribosome stalling that secondarily destabilizes both isoforms.**\n- My calculation shows a significant *increase* in PSI, not a decrease.\n- This option introduces an external claim (\"causes ribosome stalling that secondarily destabilizes both isoforms\") which is not given in the problem statement and contradicts the explicit premises that $\\delta_{\\text{incl}}$ decreases (stabilization) and $\\delta_{\\text{skip}}$ is unchanged. One must solve the problem based *only* on the provided information.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The PSI will remain unchanged because alternative splicing occurs in the nucleus upstream of translation-dependent surveillance and thus is independent of decay rates.**\n- This statement commits a logical error. While splicing decisions (which determine the ratio of $\\alpha_{\\text{incl}}$ to $\\alpha_{\\text{skip}}$) occur in the nucleus, PSI is measured from cytoplasmic steady-state RNA levels.\n- Steady-state abundance is a function of both synthesis ($\\alpha_i$) and decay ($\\delta_i$). By definition, $\\text{PSI}$ is a function of the decay rates. Changes in decay rates *must* alter the measured PSI, even if splicing itself is unchanged. My calculation confirms that PSI changes significantly.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The PSI will increase to approximately one-half (about $0.5$) because inhibiting Nonsense-Mediated Decay equalizes the steady-state abundances of the inclusion and skipping isoforms.**\n- My calculation shows the new PSI is $\\approx 0.0526$, which is far from $0.5$.\n- The reasoning provided is also flawed. The new steady-state abundances are proportional to $500$ and $9000$ for the inclusion and skipping isoforms, respectively. These are not equal. The disparity in their synthesis rates ($\\alpha_{\\text{incl}} = 10$ vs. $\\alpha_{\\text{skip}} = 90$) ensures that their abundances do not equalize even when their decay rates become more similar.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2774623"}]}
