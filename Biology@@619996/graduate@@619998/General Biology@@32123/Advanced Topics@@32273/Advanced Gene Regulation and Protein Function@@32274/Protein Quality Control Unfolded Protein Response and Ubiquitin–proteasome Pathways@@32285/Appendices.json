A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nLet $[U]$ and $[M]$ represent the number of molecules in the unfolded and misfolded states, respectively. The dynamics of these populations are described by the following system of ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{d[U]}{dt} = s - k_f [U] - k_m [U]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d[M]}{dt} = k_m [U] - k_d [M]\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the system is at steady state. At steady state, the concentrations of the transient intermediates, $[U]$ and $[M]$, are constant. Therefore, their time derivatives are zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d[U]_{ss}}{dt} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d[M]_{ss}}{dt} = 0\n$$\nHere, the subscript $ss$ denotes the steady-state value.\n\nApplying this condition to the first equation:\n$$\ns - k_f [U]_{ss} - k_m [U]_{ss} = 0\n$$\n$$\ns = (k_f + k_m) [U]_{ss}\n$$\nFrom this, we can solve for the steady-state concentration of unfolded proteins:\n$$\n[U]_{ss} = \\frac{s}{k_f + k_m}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the ultimate fractions of proteins that are correctly folded or degraded. These fractions are determined by the partitioning of the total flux at the branch points of the network. The total influx of new proteins is $s$. This flux is partitioned at state $U$ into a folding flux, $J_N$, and a misfolding flux, $J_M$.\n\nThe flux of proteins towards the native state $N$ is given by:\n$$\nJ_N = k_f [U]_{ss}\n$$\nThe flux of proteins towards the misfolded state $M$ is given by:\n$$\nJ_M = k_m [U]_{ss}\n$$\nAccording to the model, all proteins that enter state $M$ are committed to degradation, as it is the only exit path from $M$. Therefore, the flux of degraded proteins, $J_D$, must equal the flux into the misfolded state at steady state, $J_M$. This is also confirmed by the steady-state equation for $[M]$: $k_m [U]_{ss} = k_d [M]_{ss} = J_D$.\n\nThe fraction of total synthesized protein flux ($s$) that is directed to the native state, $f_N$, is the ratio of the folding flux $J_N$ to the total synthesis rate $s$:\n$$\nf_N = \\frac{J_N}{s} = \\frac{k_f [U]_{ss}}{s}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $[U]_{ss}$:\n$$\nf_N = \\frac{k_f}{s} \\left( \\frac{s}{k_f + k_m} \\right) = \\frac{k_f}{k_f + k_m}\n$$\nSimilarly, the fraction of total synthesized protein flux that is ultimately degraded, $f_D$, is the ratio of the degradation flux $J_D$ to the total synthesis rate $s$. As established, $J_D = J_M = k_m [U]_{ss}$.\n$$\nf_D = \\frac{J_D}{s} = \\frac{k_m [U]_{ss}}{s}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $[U]_{ss}$:\n$$\nf_D = \\frac{k_m}{s} \\left( \\frac{s}{k_f + k_m} \\right) = \\frac{k_m}{k_f + k_m}\n$$\nThese fractions represent the probabilistic outcome for any given protein entering the unfolded pool $U$. The probability of folding is the ratio of its specific rate constant ($k_f$) to the sum of all rate constants for pathways exiting $U$ ($k_f + k_m$). The probability of misfolding (and subsequent degradation) is the ratio of its rate constant ($k_m$) to the same total exit rate.\n\nNote that the rate constant for degradation, $k_d$, and the synthesis rate, $s$, do not appear in the final expressions for the fractions. The rate $k_d$ determines the steady-state level of misfolded protein, $[M]_{ss}$, but not the fraction of flux that is channeled into the degradation pathway. The synthesis rate $s$ cancels out, as we are concerned with fractions of the total flux, not the absolute magnitude of the fluxes.\n\nAs a check for consistency, the sum of the fractions must equal $1$, as folding and degradation are the only two possible fates:\n$$\nf_N + f_D = \\frac{k_f}{k_f + k_m} + \\frac{k_m}{k_f + k_m} = \\frac{k_f + k_m}{k_f + k_m} = 1\n$$\nThe logic is sound and the results are consistent. The final answer is the row vector of these two fractions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{k_f}{k_f + k_m} & \\frac{k_m}{k_f + k_m} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2828959"}, {"introduction": "When the protein folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum is overwhelmed, the cell activates the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), a key branch of which is to reduce the incoming protein load by slowing down translation.

The problem is mathematically well-posed, providing a set of clear constraints and a guiding principle—simplicity—to deduce a unique functional form. It is free of contradictions and contains all necessary information. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to find an explicit expression for the protein synthesis initiation rate, $I(p)$, as a function of the fractional eIF2α phosphorylation, $p$. The rate $I(p)$ is related to the basal rate $I_{0}$ through the normalized function $r(p) \\equiv I(p)/I_{0}$. We must first determine the form of $r(p)$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the simplest functional form consistent with \"single-step sequestration kinetics\" should be used. This physical description corresponds to a simple binding equilibrium. Let the active species be free eIF2B, and the inactive species be phosphorylated eIF2α ($p$-eIF2α). The sequestration is a reaction where $p$-eIF2α binds to eIF2B to form an inactive complex. The rate of translation initiation, $I(p)$, is proportional to the concentration of free, active eIF2B. In a simple binding model, the fraction of unbound eIF2B follows the form of a Hill-Langmuir equation or, more simply, a Michaelis-Menten-type saturation curve. The simplest rational function describing such inhibition is of the form:\n$$ r(p) = \\frac{C}{1 + \\beta p} $$\nwhere $C$ and $\\beta$ are constants to be determined. This form is the most elementary representation of a process where an inhibitor (proportional to $p$) sequesters a target.\n\nWe apply the given constraints to determine the constants $C$ and $\\beta$.\n\nConstraint 1: $r(0) = 1$.\nSubstituting $p=0$ into our proposed function:\n$$ r(0) = \\frac{C}{1 + \\beta(0)} = C $$\nFrom the constraint, we must have $C=1$. The function thus simplifies to:\n$$ r(p) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\beta p} $$\n\nConstraint 2: $r'(0) = -\\alpha$.\nFirst, we compute the derivative of $r(p)$ with respect to $p$:\n$$ r'(p) = \\frac{d}{dp} \\left( (1 + \\beta p)^{-1} \\right) = -1 \\cdot (1 + \\beta p)^{-2} \\cdot \\beta = \\frac{-\\beta}{(1 + \\beta p)^2} $$\nNext, we evaluate this derivative at $p=0$:\n$$ r'(0) = \\frac{-\\beta}{(1 + \\beta(0))^2} = -\\beta $$\nThe problem states that $r'(0) = -\\alpha$. Therefore, we have $\\beta = \\alpha$.\n\nSubstituting $\\beta = \\alpha$ back into the expression for $r(p)$, we obtain the definitive functional form for the normalized initiation rate:\n$$ r(p) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha p} $$\n\nWe must verify this function against the remaining constraints.\n-   $r(p)$ must be positive. For $p \\ge 0$ and $\\alpha > 0$ (as it represents inhibition strength), the denominator $1 + \\alpha p$ is always greater than or equal to $1$. Thus, $r(p)$ is always positive.\n-   $r(p)$ must be monotonically decreasing. The derivative is $r'(p) = -\\alpha / (1 + \\alpha p)^2$.

At any subsequent time $t$, this initial cohort is partitioned into three states: remaining in the ER as band B (intensity $B(t)$), having matured to the Golgi as band C (intensity $C(t)$), or having been degraded (intensity $D(t)$).\n$$I_0 = B(t) + C(t) + D(t)$$\nThe problem states that at the final time point, $t=120$ minutes, any remaining band B is destined for degradation and band C is stable. Therefore, the total amount of protein that successfully matures is given by the intensity of band C at $t=120$ min, which we denote as $C_{final}$. The total amount of protein that is ultimately degraded is the initial amount minus the amount that successfully matures, $D_{total} = I_0 - C_{final}$.\n\n**Task 1: Compute the \"fraction rescued\"**\n\nFirst, we determine the final outcomes for the vehicle and chaperone conditions.\nLet the subscripts 'veh' and 'chap' denote the vehicle and chaperone conditions, respectively.\n\nFor the **vehicle condition**:\nThe amount of successfully matured CFTR is the band C intensity at $t=120$ min.\n$$C_{veh, final} = C_{veh}(120) = 1800 \\text{ cpm}$$\nThe total amount of CFTR lost to ERAD is the initial amount minus this matured amount.\n$$D_{veh, total} = I_0 - C_{veh, final} = 10000 - 1800 = 8200 \\text{ cpm}$$\n\nFor the **chemical chaperone condition**:\nThe amount of successfully matured CFTR is:\n$$C_{chap, final} = C_{chap}(120) = 3700 \\text{ cpm}$$\n\nThe definition of \"fraction rescued\", $F_{rescued}$, is the number of molecules that are rescued from degradation (and thus appear as band C under chaperone treatment) divided by the number of molecules that would have been degraded under vehicle treatment.\nThe number of molecules rescued is the increase in the matured population due to the chaperone.\n$$\\text{Rescued amount} = C_{chap, final} - C_{veh, final} = 3700 - 1800 = 1900 \\text{ cpm}$$\nThese $1900$ cpm worth of protein would have been degraded in the vehicle condition.
