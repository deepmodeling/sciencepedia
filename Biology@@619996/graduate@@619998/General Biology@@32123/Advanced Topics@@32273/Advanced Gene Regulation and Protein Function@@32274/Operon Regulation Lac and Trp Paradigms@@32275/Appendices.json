This first exercise focuses on the principle of positive control in the *lac* operon, known as catabolite activation. By predicting the outcomes for mutants defective in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)–cAMP receptor protein (CRP) system, you will connect specific molecular defects (in the $cyaA$ or $crp$ genes) to a clear physiological phenotype—the ability to grow on lactose—and appreciate why this activation is essential for robust expression, even when the operon is derepressed [@problem_id:2820402].", "problem": "Escherichia coli uses the lactose (lac) operon to catabolize lactose. From the Central Dogma (DNA is transcribed to RNA, which is translated to protein) and core definitions of transcriptional regulation, the following well-tested facts apply: (i) the lac repressor (LacI) binds the operator and blocks transcription in the absence of the inducer allolactose; (ii) when lactose enters the cell, a fraction is converted to allolactose, which reduces LacI affinity for DNA and derepresses the operon; (iii) efficient transcription from the lac promoter requires positive control by the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)–cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complex, which binds upstream of the promoter and recruits RNA polymerase; (iv) adenylate cyclase, encoded by $cyaA$, synthesizes intracellular cAMP; (v) lactose minimal medium contains lactose as the sole utilizable carbon source, so growth requires sufficient expression of both $lacY$ (permease) and $lacZ$ (beta-galactosidase) to import and metabolize lactose. Assume no glucose is present and that exogenous membrane-permeable cAMP can be supplied as indicated.\n\nFour isogenic strains are transferred from a non-inducing medium lacking lactose to minimal medium with lactose as the sole carbon source: wild type, $cyaA^{-}$, $cyaA^{-}$ with exogenous cAMP supplied, and $crp^{-}$. For each strain, predict the qualitative state of lac operon transcription (near-basal versus strongly induced) and the ability to grow on lactose minimal medium (growth versus no growth).

Exogenous, membrane-permeable cAMP can be supplied.\n- Experiment: Four isogenic strains are analyzed: wild type, $cyaA^{-}$, $cyaA^{-}$ with exogenous cAMP, and $crp^{-}$.\n- Transfer condition: Strains are moved from a non-inducing medium to a lactose minimal medium.\n- Question: Predict the state of *lac* operon transcription (near-basal vs. strongly induced) and the ability to grow on lactose minimal medium (growth vs. no growth) for each strain.\n\nStep 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem describes the canonical model of dual control of the *lac* operon, which is a cornerstone of molecular biology and genetics.\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The premises are factually correct and represent a standard textbook description of *lac* operon regulation. The roles of LacI (repressor), allolactose (inducer), cAMP-CRP (activator complex), adenylate cyclase (source of cAMP), and the requirement for both permease and beta-galactosidase for growth are all stated correctly.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined. The genetic backgrounds of the four strains are specified, the environmental conditions are explicit (lactose minimal medium, no glucose), and the questions to be answered (transcription level and growth) are unambiguous. The provided facts are sufficient to logically deduce the outcome for each case.\n-   **Objective**: The language is technical and free of subjectivity.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. The explicit statement that \"exogenous membrane-permeable cAMP can be supplied\" is crucial and prevents ambiguity about the rescue experiment. The conditions are consistent and do not contain contradictions.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. It provides a valid basis for a rigorous analysis. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe analysis will proceed by evaluating each strain based on the two required regulatory inputs for the *lac* operon: (1) relief of repression by the inducer and (2) positive activation by the cAMP-CRP complex.\n\n1.  **Wild Type Strain**:\n    -   Repression: The medium contains lactose. A small amount of lactose will enter the cell via the few pre-existing permeases and be converted to allolactose. Allolactose binds to the LacI repressor, causing it to dissociate from the operator. Repression is lifted.\n    -   Activation: The medium lacks glucose. The absence of glucose leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase, which synthesizes cAMP. In a wild type strain, both $cyaA$ and $crp$ genes are functional. cAMP binds to the CRP protein, forming the cAMP-CRP activator complex. This complex binds to the CRP binding site on the DNA, recruiting RNA polymerase and strongly promoting transcription.\n    -   Outcome: With repression lifted and activation present, transcription of the *lac* operon is **strongly induced**. This leads to the synthesis of sufficient LacZ and LacY proteins to support metabolism of lactose as the sole carbon source. The result is **growth**.\n\n2.  **$cyaA^{-}$ Strain**:\n    -   Repression: As with the wild type, the presence of lactose leads to the formation of allolactose and the derepression of the operon.\n    -   Activation: This strain has a non-functional $cyaA$ gene, meaning it cannot synthesize adenylate cyclase. Therefore, even in the absence of glucose, intracellular cAMP levels remain very low. Without cAMP, the CRP protein remains inactive, and the cAMP-CRP activator complex cannot form. No positive activation of transcription occurs.\n    -   Outcome: Although repression is lifted, there is no activation. The *lac* promoter is intrinsically weak, and RNA polymerase binds it poorly on its own. Transcription occurs only at a **near-basal** level. According to fact (v), this low level of expression is insufficient to produce enough permease and beta-galactosidase for sustained growth on lactose. The result is **no growth**.\n\n3.  **$cyaA^{-}$ Strain with Exogenous cAMP**:\n    -   Repression: Derepression occurs due to the presence of lactose, as in the previous cases.\n    -   Activation: The cell cannot synthesize its own cAMP, but cAMP is supplied externally and is membrane-permeable. This exogenous cAMP enters the cell and can bind to the CRP protein (which is functional in this strain). The cAMP-CRP complex forms and activates transcription. The genetic defect is thus chemically complemented.\n    -   Outcome: Both conditions for high-level expression are met: derepression and activation. Transcription is **strongly induced**, and the cell produces enough enzymes to metabolize lactose. The result is **growth**.\n\n4.  **$crp^{-}$ Strain**:\n    -   Repression: Derepression occurs due to the presence of lactose.\n    -   Activation: This strain has a non-functional $crp$ gene, meaning it cannot produce a functional CRP protein. Even though the cell can produce cAMP (since $cyaA$ is wild type), there is no functional CRP for it to bind to. The cAMP-CRP activator complex cannot form. No positive activation occurs.\n    -   Outcome: This situation is functionally equivalent to the $cyaA^{-}$ strain without rescue. Repression is lifted, but there is no activation. Transcription is at a **near-basal** level, which is insufficient for growth on lactose. The result is **no growth**. Supplying exogenous cAMP to this strain would have no effect, as the receptor for cAMP is missing.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, we can evaluate the options.\n\n**Option A**:\n-   Wild type: \"strongly induced, growth.\" This is **Correct**.\n-   $cyaA^{-}$: \"near-basal, no growth\". This is **Correct**.\n-   $cyaA^{-}$ with cAMP: \"exogenous cAMP restores strong induction and growth\". This is **Correct**.\n-   $crp^{-}$: \"near-basal, no growth; exogenous cAMP does not restore growth\". This is **Correct**.\nEvery statement in this option aligns perfectly with the principles of *lac* operon regulation.\n\n**Option B**:\n-   $cyaA^{-}$: \"moderately induced, slow growth\". This is **Incorrect**. Without cAMP-CRP activation, transcription is near-basal, not moderate, and is insufficient for growth.\n-   $crp^{-}$: \"moderately induced, slow growth\". This is **Incorrect** for the same reason.\n\n**Option C**:\n-   $cyaA^{-}$: \"...exogenous cAMP cannot rescue because cAMP must be synthesized by adenylate cyclase to function.\" This is **Incorrect**. The source of the cAMP molecule is irrelevant to its function, provided it can enter the cell and bind to CRP. The problem explicitly states it is membrane-permeable.\n-   $crp^{-}$: \"...growth is restored by exogenous cAMP because cAMP directly activates RNA polymerase...\" This is **Incorrect**. First, a $crp^{-}$ mutation cannot be rescued by cAMP. Second, cAMP does not directly interact with RNA polymerase; its action is mediated through CRP.\n\n**Option D**:\n-   $cyaA^{-}$: \"strongly induced, growth because lactose induction suffices without cAMP\". This is **Incorrect**. Fact (iii) explicitly states that efficient transcription requires positive control by the cAMP-CRP complex. Lactose induction (derepression) alone is not sufficient.\n-   $crp^{-}$: \"...exogenous cAMP rescues growth...\". This is **Incorrect**. Adding the ligand (cAMP) cannot compensate for a missing receptor (CRP).\n\nTherefore, Option A is the only one that provides a completely correct description of the outcomes for all four experimental conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2820402"}, {"introduction": "The groundbreaking work of François Jacob and Jacques Monod was built on elegant genetic experiments using partial diploids, or merodiploids. This practice challenges you to apply their logic to decipher the behavior of complex genotypes, reinforcing the critical distinction between *trans*-acting factors (like the LacI repressor protein) and *cis*-acting elements (like the $lacO$ operator site). By working through these scenarios involving various alleles, you will master the concepts of genetic complementation and dominance, which are fundamental to analyzing any regulatory network [@problem_id:2820395].", "problem": "A bacterium carries a chromosomal lactose operon and an episomal F-prime plasmid bearing a second lactose operon, creating a partial diploid for the region. The lactose repressor gene $lacI$ may be present on one or both replicons in different allelic forms, and each operon has its own operator $lacO$ in either wild-type or mutant state as indicated below. Consider the following canonical, widely accepted facts as the fundamental base for reasoning:\n\n- By the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, an allele of $lacI$ encodes a protein repressor that is synthesized in the cytoplasm and can diffuse throughout the cell (acts in trans) to bind operator sites $lacO$ and prevent transcription initiation of adjacent lactose structural genes.\n- The wild-type repressor encoded by $lacI^{+}$ binds $lacO$ and is allosterically inhibited by the inducer allolactose or isopropyl $\\beta$-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), which decreases repressor affinity for $lacO$ and permits transcription of the adjacent operon.\n- The null $lacI^{-}$ allele fails to produce a functional repressor; therefore, it cannot repress any operon in trans.\n- The superrepressor $lacI^{s}$ allele produces a repressor that binds $lacO$ but cannot bind inducer; it remains repressive regardless of inducer concentration and acts in trans on any repressible operator.\n- The constitutive operator $lacO^{c}$ is a cis-acting DNA mutation that prevents repressor binding to that operator only; it does not produce a diffusible product. Its effect is restricted to the operon on the same DNA molecule.\n\nAssume that the F-prime plasmid is single-copy and that permease is not limiting, so that the presence of IPTG reflects true induction potential. Expression from each operon is monitored by epitope-tagged $\\beta$-galactosidase ($lacZ$) reporters that allow one to tell chromosomal from plasmid output. The phenotype is described as follows: repressed means no $lacZ$ expression in the absence of inducer; inducible means expression occurs only when IPTG is present; constitutive means expression occurs regardless of inducer.\n\nBelow are four candidate scenarios, each describing the genotype and the expected phenotype for chromosomal and plasmid operons. Choose all scenarios whose predicted phenotypes are correct consequences of the stated genotypes under the principles listed above.\n\nA. Genotype: chromosome $lacI^{-}, lacO^{+}$; plasmid $lacI^{+}, lacO^{+}$. Predicted phenotype: without IPTG, both operons are repressed; with IPTG, both operons are induced. Rationale claimed: $lacI^{+}$ on the plasmid produces a functional repressor that complements the chromosomal $lacI^{-}$ in trans.\n\nB. Genotype: chromosome $lacI^{s}, lacO^{+}$; plasmid $lacI^{+}, lacO^{+}$. Predicted phenotype: the chromosomal operon is repressed without IPTG and induced with IPTG, whereas the plasmid operon behaves as an inducible wild type. Rationale claimed: $lacI^{s}$ acts only on its own operon (cis), and the plasmid $lacI^{+}$ controls the plasmid operon independently.\n\nC. Genotype: chromosome $lacI^{+}, lacO^{c}$; plasmid $lacI^{+}, lacO^{+}$. Predicted phenotype: the chromosomal operon is constitutive, while the plasmid operon is inducible (repressed without IPTG and induced with IPTG). Rationale claimed: $lacO^{c}$ prevents any repressor from acting in cis on the chromosomal operon; the plasmid operator remains repressible by diffusible $lacI^{+}$.\n\nD. Genotype: chromosome $lacI^{+}, lacO^{+}$; plasmid $lacI^{s}, lacO^{+}$. Predicted phenotype: neither operon can be induced by IPTG; both are repressed regardless of inducer. Rationale claimed: $lacI^{s}$ produces a superrepressor that acts in trans and is not inactivated by IPTG, dominating over $lacI^{+}$.\n\nSelect all correct options.", "solution": "The problem statement is a standard exercise in bacterial genetics, specifically concerning the regulation of the lactose operon as established by Jacob and Monod. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive the phenotypes from the given genotypes. The definitions of alleles and their modes of action (trans-acting proteins vs. cis-acting DNA sites) are canonical. Therefore, the problem is valid and we may proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe analysis hinges on two principles:\n$1$. The action of diffusible protein products versus non-diffusible DNA sites. Proteins encoded by $lacI$ alleles ($lacI^{+}$, $lacI^{-}$, $lacI^{s}$) are synthesized in the cytoplasm and act in trans, meaning they can diffuse and affect any compatible operon within the cell. DNA sequences like the operator $lacO$ are cis-acting elements, meaning they only affect the expression of genes on the same DNA molecule.\n$2$. The dominance relationships between alleles. For the repressor: $lacI^{s}$ is dominant to $lacI^{+}$, which is dominant to $lacI^{-}$. For the operator, $lacO^{c}$ is dominant in cis to $lacO^{+}$.\n\nWe will now evaluate each scenario.\n\nA. Genotype: chromosome $lacI^{-}, lacO^{+}$; plasmid $lacI^{+}, lacO^{+}$.\nThe full genotype of this partial diploid is $lacI^{-} lacO^{+} / \\text{F'} lacI^{+} lacO^{+}$.\nThe $lacI^{-}$ allele on the chromosome fails to produce a functional repressor. However, the $lacI^{+}$ allele on the F-prime plasmid produces a wild-type, functional repressor protein. This protein is diffusible and acts in trans. It can therefore bind to both the chromosomal $lacO^{+}$ operator and the plasmid $lacO^{+}$ operator. The presence of the functional repressor from the plasmid complements the defect of the chromosomal $lacI^{-}$ allele. Consequently, the entire cell behaves as a $lacI^{+}$ wild type.\n- Without inducer (IPTG): The $lacI^{+}$ repressor binds to both $lacO^{+}$ sites, repressing transcription of both the chromosomal and plasmid operons.\n- With inducer (IPTG): The inducer binds to the $lacI^{+}$ repressor, causing an allosteric change that prevents it from binding to the operator sites. Both operons are transcribed.\nThe predicted phenotype is that both operons are inducible. The provided statement says: \"without IPTG, both operons are repressed; with IPTG, both operons are induced.\" This is the definition of an inducible phenotype. The rationale is also correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Genotype: chromosome $lacI^{s}, lacO^{+}$; plasmid $lacI^{+}, lacO^{+}$.\nThe full genotype is $lacI^{s} lacO^{+} / \\text{F'} lacI^{+} lacO^{+}$.\nThe chromosome produces a $lacI^{s}$ superrepressor protein, and the plasmid produces a $lacI^{+}$ wild-type repressor protein. Both are diffusible and act in trans. The key fact is that the $lacI^{s}$ protein cannot bind the inducer. It binds to operator DNA and remains bound even in the presence of IPTG. Thus, $lacI^{s}$ is dominant to $lacI^{+}$. The $lacI^{s}$ repressor will bind to both the chromosomal $lacO^{+}$ and the plasmid $lacO^{+}$ operators, effectively shutting down both operons permanently.\nThe option's rationale claims that \"$lacI^{s}$ acts only on its own operon (cis)\". This is fundamentally incorrect. $lacI^{s}$ is a gene that encodes a protein, a diffusible product, and therefore must act in trans. Due to this incorrect rationale, the predicted phenotype is also flawed. The correct phenotype is that both operons are non-inducible (repressed regardless of inducer presence).\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Genotype: chromosome $lacI^{+}, lacO^{c}$; plasmid $lacI^{+}, lacO^{+}$.\nThe full genotype is $lacI^{+} lacO^{c} / \\text{F'} lacI^{+} lacO^{+}$.\nThis cell produces functional $lacI^{+}$ repressor proteins from both the chromosome and the plasmid. These repressors can diffuse throughout the cell.\n- Chromosomal operon: It has a constitutive operator, $lacO^{c}$. This DNA sequence is mutated such that no repressor, including the $lacI^{+}$ protein, can bind to it. Because the operator cannot be bound, transcription of the chromosomal operon cannot be repressed. It will occur continuously, regardless of the presence or absence of IPTG. The effect of $lacO^{c}$ is cis-dominant.\n- Plasmid operon: It has a wild-type operator, $lacO^{+}$. This operator can be bound by the $lacI^{+}$ repressor proteins present in the cell. Thus, in the absence of IPTG, the plasmid operon will be repressed. In the presence of IPTG, the repressor will be inactivated, and the operon will be induced. The plasmid operon is therefore inducible.\nThe predicted phenotype is that the chromosomal operon is constitutive and the plasmid operon is inducible. The rationale provided is also perfectly sound.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. Genotype: chromosome $lacI^{+}, lacO^{+}$; plasmid $lacI^{s}, lacO^{+}$.\nThe full genotype is $lacI^{+} lacO^{+} / \\text{F'} lacI^{s} lacO^{+}$.\nThis genetic situation is functionally identical to that in option B. The cell produces both wild-type $lacI^{+}$ repressor (from the chromosome) and superrepressor $lacI^{s}$ protein (from the plasmid). Both are diffusible and act in trans. The $lacI^{s}$ superrepressor is dominant because it binds to operators but is immune to inactivation by the inducer. Therefore, the $lacI^{s}$ protein will bind to both the chromosomal $lacO^{+}$ and the plasmid $lacO^{+}$ operators and will not be removed by IPTG. Both operons will be permanently repressed.\nThe predicted phenotype is \"neither operon can be induced by IPTG; both are repressed regardless of inducer.\" The rationale, \"$lacI^{s}$ produces a superrepressor that acts in trans and is not inactivated by IPTG, dominating over $lacI^{+}$\", is also correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2820395"}, {"introduction": "While qualitative models provide a logical framework, a deeper understanding of gene regulation comes from quantitative prediction. This final practice moves from genetic logic to a physical model, applying the principles of statistical mechanics to connect molecular energetics to gene expression levels.

It is a standard application of statistical mechanics to model transcriptional regulation, a valid problem in quantitative biology. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system is described by a thermodynamic occupancy model with two states for the promoter: repressor-unbound (state $1$) and repressor-bound (state $2$). We are to analyze the system under steady-state conditions in the absence of an inducer.\n\nAccording to the principles of statistical mechanics, the probability of the system being in a particular state $i$ is given by its Boltzmann weight divided by the partition function $Z$. The Boltzmann weight of a state with energy $E_i$ is $\\exp(-\\beta E_i)$, where $\\beta \\equiv \\frac{1}{k_B T}$. The partition function $Z$ is the sum of the Boltzmann weights of all possible states.\n\nLet us define the energy of the repressor-unbound state as the reference energy, so $E_1 = 0$. The problem defines $\\Delta G$ as the free-energy difference for repressor binding. This corresponds to the energy of the repressor-bound state relative to the unbound state. Thus, the energy of the repressor-bound state is $E_2 = \\Delta G$.\n\nThe partition function $Z$ for this two-state system is:\n$$Z = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\exp(-\\beta E_i) = \\exp(-\\beta E_1) + \\exp(-\\beta E_2) = \\exp(-\\beta \\cdot 0) + \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta G)$$\n$$Z = 1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta G)$$\n\nThe problem states that the mean expression level, which we denote as $\\mathcal{E}$, is proportional to the probability that the operator is not bound by the repressor. This is the probability of being in the repressor-unbound state, $P_{\\text{unbound}}$.\n$$P_{\\text{unbound}} = P(1) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta E_1)}{Z} = \\frac{\\exp(0)}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta G)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta G)}$$\nTherefore, the expression level is given by $\\mathcal{E} = C \\cdot P_{\\text{unbound}}$, where $C$ is a constant of proportionality.\n$$\\mathcal{E} = \\frac{C}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta G)}$$\n\nWe are analyzing a mutation that changes the repressor binding free energy from $\\Delta G_{\\text{old}}$ to $\\Delta G_{\\text{new}}$.

Strong repression means the probability of the repressor-bound state is much higher than the probability of the unbound state. In terms of the partition function $Z_{\\text{old}} = 1 + \\exp(-\\beta\\Delta G_{\\text{old}})$, this means the term corresponding to the bound state, $\\exp(-\\beta\\Delta G_{\\text{old}})$, dominates over the term for the unbound state, which is $1$.\nThe condition for strong repression is therefore:\n$$\\exp(-\\beta \\Delta G_{\\text{old}}) \\gg 1$$\nThis is equivalent to stating that the binding is strong, i.e., $\\Delta G_{\\text{old}}$ is a large negative value in units of $k_B T$.\n\nTo find the fold-change in this limit, we analyze the behavior of the expression as $\\exp(-\\beta \\Delta G_{\\text{old}}) \\to \\infty$.

Our result, $\\exp(2) \\approx 7.39$, is greater than $1$, which is physically consistent.
