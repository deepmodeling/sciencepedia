We can rearrange this equilibrium expression to solve for the concentration of free sites, $[S]$:\n$$[S] = \\frac{K_d [AS]}{[A]}$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[S]$ into the conservation equation for the total sites:\n$$[S]_T = \\frac{K_d [AS]}{[A]} + [AS]$$\nTo find an expression for $f$, we can factor out $[AS]$ from the right-hand side:\n$$[S]_T = [AS] \\left( \\frac{K_d}{[A]} + 1 \\right) = [AS] \\left( \\frac{K_d + [A]}{[A]} \\right)$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for the ratio $\\frac{[AS]}{[S]_T}$ gives the fractional occupancy $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{[AS]}{[S]_T} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d + [A]}{[A]}} = \\frac{[A]}{[A] + K_d}$$\nThis is the well-known Langmuir-Hill equation for non-cooperative binding ($n=1$).\n\nWith the derived expression for $f$, we can now substitute the given parameter values: $K_d = 10\\,\\text{nM}$ and $[A] = 30\\,\\text{nM}$.\n$$f = \\frac{30\\,\\text{nM}}{30\\,\\text{nM} + 10\\,\\text{nM}} = \\frac{30}{40} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\n\nNext, we analyze the transcriptional output.
