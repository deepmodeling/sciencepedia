{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The architecture of the genome begins with the fundamental physics of protein-DNA interactions. To quantitatively model gene regulation, we must first understand the principles governing the binding of transcription factors (TFs) to their target sites. This exercise guides you through the process of deriving the binding occupancy, $\\theta$, from the law of mass action and the dissociation constant, $K_d$, before extending this model to account for cooperativity—a crucial phenomenon where the binding of one factor influences the affinity of another nearby [@problem_id:2786758]. Mastering this foundational model provides the essential quantitative language for describing how cis-regulatory elements are established and maintained.", "problem": "You are studying the equilibrium binding of a single Transcription Factor (TF) to a Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) site and then extending to two DNA sites with thermodynamic cooperativity. Use only the Law of Mass Action, the definition of the equilibrium dissociation constant, and the statistical mechanics of equilibrium occupancy, without assuming any target formula in advance.\n\nPart A (single site): Consider the equilibrium reaction $TF + S \\rightleftharpoons TF\\cdot S$, where $S$ denotes a single binding site on DNA. Let the dissociation constant be defined by $K_{d} = \\frac{[TF][S]}{[TF\\cdot S]}$ at equilibrium. Define the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ of the site as $\\theta = \\frac{[TF\\cdot S]}{[S]_{\\text{tot}}}$, where $[S]_{\\text{tot}} = [S] + [TF\\cdot S]$ is the total site concentration. Starting from these definitions, derive an expression for $\\theta$ as a function of $[TF]$ and $K_{d}$.\n\nPart B (two sites with cooperativity): Now consider two distinct DNA sites, $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$, both binding the same TF with dissociation constants $K_{d1}$ and $K_{d2}$, respectively. Assume that when both sites are bound simultaneously, there is an interaction free energy that modifies the double-bound state’s statistical weight by a dimensionless cooperativity factor $\\omega$ (with $\\omega = \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta G_{\\text{int}})$, $\\beta = \\frac{1}{k_{B}T}$, $k_{B}$ the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ the absolute temperature).

It presents a standard, canonical exercise in the physical chemistry of macromolecular binding, which is a fundamental topic in molecular biology. All necessary definitions and parameters are provided. We shall proceed with the derivation in three parts.\n\nPart A: The fractional occupancy $\\theta$ of a single binding site.\nThe analysis begins with the law of mass action applied to the specified equilibrium reaction:\n$$TF + S \\rightleftharpoons TF\\cdot S$$\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_{d}$, is defined by the ratio of concentrations of dissociated species to the associated complex:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[TF][S]}{[TF\\cdot S]}$$\nHere, $[TF]$ is the concentration of free transcription factor, $[S]$ is the concentration of free binding sites, and $[TF\\cdot S]$ is the concentration of the bound complex. Our objective is to find the fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, defined as the fraction of total sites that are occupied:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[TF\\cdot S]}{[S]_{\\text{tot}}}$$\nThe total concentration of sites, $[S]_{\\text{tot}}$, is the sum of free sites and bound sites:\n$$[S]_{\\text{tot}} = [S] + [TF\\cdot S]$$\nFrom the definition of $K_{d}$, we express the concentration of free sites, $[S]$, in terms of the bound complex concentration, $[TF\\cdot S]$:\n$$[S] = K_{d} \\frac{[TF\\cdot S]}{[TF]}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[S]$ into the equation for the total site concentration:\n$$[S]_{\\text{tot}} = K_{d} \\frac{[TF\\cdot S]}{[TF]} + [TF\\cdot S]$$\nFactoring out the term $[TF\\cdot S]$ yields:\n$$[S]_{\\text{tot}} = [TF\\cdot S] \\left( \\frac{K_{d}}{[TF]} + 1 \\right)$$\nTo find $\\theta$, we rearrange this equation to form the ratio $\\frac{[TF\\cdot S]}{[S]_{\\text{tot}}}$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[TF\\cdot S]}{[S]_{\\text{tot}}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{d}}{[TF]} + 1}$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $[TF]$ gives the final, standard expression for the fractional occupancy, which is a function of $[TF]$ and $K_{d}$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[TF]}{[TF] + K_{d}}$$\nThis result is also known as the Langmuir binding isotherm.\n\nPart B: The probability of simultaneous binding to two cooperative sites.\nWe now consider a system with two distinct binding sites, $S_1$ and $S_2$, on the same DNA molecule. We use the framework of equilibrium statistical mechanics. The system can exist in four possible microstates depending on the binding status of the two sites:\n$1$. State $00$: Both sites $S_1$ and $S_2$ are empty.\n$2$. State $10$: Site $S_1$ is bound by $TF$, site $S_2$ is empty.\n$3$. State $01$: Site $S_1$ is empty, site $S_2$ is bound by $TF$.\n$4$. State $11$: Both sites $S_1$ and $S_2$ are bound by $TF$.\n\nThe probability of finding the system in any particular microstate is determined by its statistical weight relative to the sum of all statistical weights. Let us define the statistical weight of the reference state (State $00$) as $W_{00} = 1$. The weights of the other states are determined relative to this state, based on the law of mass action.\n\nThe concentration of State $10$ is related to the concentration of State $00$ by the binding equilibrium at site $S_1$: $[State_{10}] = \\frac{[TF]}{K_{d1}} [State_{00}]$. Thus, its statistical weight is:\n$$W_{10} = \\frac{[TF]}{K_{d1}}$$\nSimilarly, for State $01$, binding occurs at site $S_2$:\n$$W_{01} = \\frac{[TF]}{K_{d2}}$$\nFor State $11$, both sites are bound. This process can be viewed as two sequential binding events. The binding of the second $TF$ is modified by the cooperativity factor $\\omega$. The equilibrium for the formation of the double-bound state from the empty state and two $TF$ molecules is $[State_{11}] = \\frac{1}{K_{d1}} \\frac{\\omega}{K_{d2}} [TF]^2 [State_{00}]$. Therefore, the statistical weight is:\n$$W_{11} = \\frac{\\omega [TF]^2}{K_{d1} K_{d2}}$$\nThe term $\\omega = \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta G_{\\text{int}})$ accounts for the interaction energy $\\Delta G_{\\text{int}}$ between the two bound TFs. If $\\omega > 1$, the interaction is favorable (positive cooperativity).\n\nThe partition function, $Z$, for this system is the sum of the statistical weights of all possible microstates:\n$$Z = W_{00} + W_{10} + W_{01} + W_{11} = 1 + \\frac{[TF]}{K_{d1}} + \\frac{[TF]}{K_{d2}} + \\frac{\\omega [TF]^2}{K_{d1} K_{d2}}$$\nThe probability of a specific microstate is its weight divided by the partition function. The problem asks for $P_2$, the probability that *both* sites are bound, which corresponds to State $11$.\n$$P_2 = \\frac{W_{11}}{Z} = \\frac{\\frac{\\omega [TF]^2}{K_{d1} K_{d2}}}{1 + \\frac{[TF]}{K_{d1}} + \\frac{[TF]}{K_{d2}} + \\frac{\\omega [TF]^2}{K_{d1} K_{d2}}}$$\n\nPart C: Numerical calculation for a symmetric system.\nWe are given the symmetric case $K_{d1} = K_{d2} = K$. The expression for $P_2$ simplifies to:\n$$P_2 = \\frac{\\frac{\\omega [TF]^2}{K^2}}{1 + \\frac{2[TF]}{K} + \\frac{\\omega [TF]^2}{K^2}}$$\nWe are given $K = 10\\,\\text{nM}$, $\\omega = 9$, and the condition $P_2 = 0.5$. Let $x$ represent the concentration $[TF]$ in units of $\\text{nM}$. We substitute the values into the equation:\n$$0.5 = \\frac{\\frac{9 x^2}{10^2}}{1 + \\frac{2x}{10} + \\frac{9 x^2}{10^2}} = \\frac{0.09 x^2}{1 + 0.2 x + 0.09 x^2}$$\nWe must now solve for $x$:\n$$0.5 (1 + 0.2 x + 0.09 x^2) = 0.09 x^2$$\n$$0.5 + 0.1 x + 0.045 x^2 = 0.09 x^2$$\nRearranging the terms gives a quadratic equation:\n$$0.045 x^2 - 0.1 x - 0.5 = 0$$\nTo simplify, we can multiply the entire equation by $200$:\n$$9 x^2 - 20 x - 100 = 0$$\nWe solve this equation for $x$ using the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=9$, $b=-20$, and $c=-100$:\n$$x = \\frac{-(-20) \\pm \\sqrt{(-20)^2 - 4(9)(-100)}}{2(9)}$$\n$$x = \\frac{20 \\pm \\sqrt{400 + 3600}}{18}$$\n$$x = \\frac{20 \\pm \\sqrt{4000}}{18} = \\frac{20 \\pm 20\\sqrt{10}}{18} = \\frac{10 \\pm 10\\sqrt{10}}{9}$$\nSince concentration, $x = [TF]$, must be a non-negative physical quantity, we must choose the positive root:\n$$x = \\frac{10 + 10\\sqrt{10}}{9}$$\nNow we evaluate this expression numerically:\n$$x = \\frac{10(1 + \\sqrt{10})}{9} \\approx \\frac{10(1 + 3.162277...)}{9} = \\frac{41.62277...}{9} \\approx 4.62475...$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as required, we obtain the concentration of the transcription factor.\n$$[TF] \\approx 4.62\\,\\text{nM}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.62}$$", "id": "2786758"}, {"introduction": "Moving from single binding events to large-scale organization, the collective action of boundary proteins like CTCF partitions the genome into insulated neighborhoods known as Topologically Associating Domains (TADs).

A Topologically Associating Domain (TAD) boundary is operationally defined as a genomic position where cross-boundary interaction frequency is reduced relative to adjacent positions, implying that a localized measure of cross-boundary contact “flux” should be minimal at boundaries. The insulation-score approach estimates this flux at each putative boundary index $k$ by aggregating contacts in a small, fixed-size neighborhood that straddles $k$.

A TAD boundary should therefore coincide with a local reduction in cross-boundary contact frequency. In a Hi-C contact matrix $C$, cross-boundary frequency around a genomic index $k$ can be probed by summing entries that straddle $k$, i.e., entries with $i \\le k < j$, within a local square neighborhood of half-width $w$ around the diagonal to limit contributions to nearby loci. This motivates defining an “insulation” statistic $I(k)$ at $k$ as the sum over a $(2w)\\times(2w)$ window that is split at $k$ into a left block $[k-w+1,k]$ and a right block $[k+1,k+w]$, with only cross terms contributing:\n$$\nI(k) \\;=\\; \\sum_{i=k-w+1}^{k} \\sum_{j=k+1}^{k+w} C_{ij}.\n$$\nBecause $I(k)$ is a positive sum, taking a logarithm stabilizes variance and compresses dynamic range; with a small pseudocount $\\epsilon$, a practical one-dimensional track is $s(k) = \\log_{2}\\!\\big(I(k)+\\epsilon\\big)$.

Since $22 < 96 < 106$, it follows that $s(3)$ is the unique local minimum among $k \\in \\{2,3,4\\}$. This index $k=3$ corresponds to the boundary between bins $3$ and $4$, which is consistent with the visible block structure of $C$ (bins $1$ through $3$ form one domain with large intra-block values, and bins $4$ through $6$ form another, with small cross-block values).\n\nWe now analyze each option:\n\nOption A: The definition\n$$\nI(k) \\;=\\; \\sum_{i=k-w+1}^{k} \\sum_{j=k+1}^{k+w} C_{ij}\n$$\nimplements the cross-boundary “diamond” sum within a $(2w)\\times(2w)$ neighborhood centered on the diagonal and split at $k$, exactly capturing the intended local cross-boundary flux. The transformation $s(k) = \\log_{2}\\!\\big(I(k)+1\\big)$ is a standard monotone variance-stabilizing step, and calling local minima of $s(k)$ follows from the principle that boundaries minimize cross-boundary contact frequency. The numerical evaluation above yields a unique minimum at $k=3$ for the given $C$ and $w=2$, matching the expected TAD boundary between bins $3$ and $4$. Verdict — Correct.\n\nOption B: This option sums intra-domain blocks on each side of $k$:\n$$\nI(k) \\;=\\; \\sum_{i=k-w+1}^{k} \\sum_{j=k-w+1}^{k} C_{ij} \\;+\\; \\sum_{i=k+1}^{k+w} \\sum_{j=k+1}^{k+w} C_{ij}.\n$$\nThis measures intra-domain enrichment rather than cross-boundary flux. Maximizing such a statistic will preferentially pick indices deep within strong domains, not the boundary between them. Moreover, calling boundaries at local maxima contradicts the boundary-as-insulator principle. For the provided matrix, this will not isolate the boundary between bins $3$ and $4$ as a minimum; instead it risks selecting positions where both flanking windows are strong. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption C: Averaging contacts across a diagonal band $\\{(i,j) : |i-j| \\le w\\}$ centered at $k$ mixes intra-domain and cross-boundary contacts and is not aligned to the split at $k$. It is not a directed cross-boundary measure and can be dominated by short-range contacts irrespective of whether they cross $k$. Minimizing such a band-average does not generically indicate a boundary and is confounded by distance-decay and domain-internal structure. The claimed minimum at $k=2$ does not follow from a principled cross-boundary insulation definition. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption D: Although the initial cross-boundary sum matches the correct structure, the option then asserts calling local maxima because “cross-boundary interactions peak at boundaries,” which inverts the defining logic of insulation (boundaries exhibit reduced cross-boundary flux). Even with additional coverage normalization (e.g., dividing by row or column marginals), the correct decision rule remains to call local minima, not maxima. The stated choice of $k=4$ therefore contradicts the insulation criterion.

The boundary is defined by a convergent pair of CTCF sites: the left-side site points rightward and the right-side site points leftward. In the wild type, chromosome conformation shows a strong boundary between two topologically associating domains (TADs), and the gene’s expression must not exceed about $2$–$3$ fold over baseline to avoid pathology. Two precise genome edits are engineered at the left-side, high-affinity CTCF motif: (i) an inversion that reverses only the motif orientation, preserving its sequence and affinity, and (ii) a deletion that removes only the motif sequence without affecting adjacent elements. All other sequences, including the right-side CTCF cluster, remain intact. Based on the loop-extrusion model in which Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) cohesin extrudes loops until halted by CTCF in an orientation-dependent manner, and the core definition that convergently oriented CTCF pairs stabilize loop anchors and boundaries, predict the most likely combined patterns for each edit across the following readouts, relative to wild type:\n\n- Genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) and micro–Chromosome Conformation Capture (Micro-C): presence or loss of a boundary corner dot, stripes, and cross-boundary contact frequencies.\n- CTCF chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) occupancy at the manipulated site.\n- Promoter capture from the dosage-sensitive gene and from the neighboring super-enhancer: evidence for enhancer adoption.\n- Messenger RNA (mRNA) levels (for example, RNA sequencing) of the dosage-sensitive gene.\n- Allelic penetrance of misexpression across single cells.\n\nChoose the option that is most consistent with these mechanisms.\n\nA. Inversion weakens but does not abolish insulation: Hi-C shows loss of the original corner dot with a partial stripe extending from the remaining right-side anchor and modestly increased cross-boundary contacts; CTCF ChIP-seq at the inverted site remains at near-wild-type occupancy; promoter capture shows increased but not saturated contacts between the gene and the neighboring super-enhancer; mRNA shows a modest upregulation (for example, median log$_2$ fold-change around $+0.5$, approximately $1.4\\times$), often with cell-to-cell variability and frequent monoallelic misexpression. Deletion collapses the local boundary: Hi-C loses the corner dot and shows a long stripe anchored at the right-side site with strong cross-boundary contact enrichment (local TAD fusion); CTCF ChIP-seq at the deleted site is lost; promoter capture shows robust enhancer adoption; mRNA increases strongly (for example, median log$_2$ fold-change around $+1.5$ to $+1.7$, approximately $3\\times$), frequently biallelic across cells.\n\nB.

The problem specifies manipulation of the left-side site, which is described as a single, high-affinity motif.\n-   **Wild-Type (WT) Configuration**: The left-side CTCF motif points rightward (`>`), and the right-side CTCF motif points leftward (`<`). This forms a `>...<` convergent pair.\n-   **WT Phenotype**: This configuration creates a strong boundary between two topologically associating domains (TADs). The gene's expression must be maintained below a $2$–$3$ fold increase over baseline to prevent pathology.\n-   **Genetic Perturbations**: Two edits are made specifically at the left-side CTCF motif:\n    1.  **Inversion**: The orientation of the motif is reversed, changing it from a rightward-pointing (`>`) to a leftward-pointing (`<`) site.

It presents a standard, non-trivial problem in regulatory genomics. Therefore, I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe solution is derived by applying the rules of the loop-extrusion model to the wild-type, inversion, and deletion scenarios.\n\n**1. Wild-Type Baseline**\n-   **Configuration**: Gene ... `>` (Left Site) ... `<` (Right Site) ... Super-enhancer (SE).\n-   **Mechanism**: A cohesin complex extruding from the gene's side (left-to-right) is blocked by the `>` motif. A cohesin complex extruding from the SE's side (right-to-left) is blocked by the `<` motif. This creates a stable loop anchored at the two CTCF sites, forming a robust TAD boundary that insulates the gene from the SE.\n-   **Expected Readouts**: Strong corner dot in Hi-C at the coordinates of the two CTCF sites, low cross-boundary contacts, baseline gene expression.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Inversion Edit**\n-   **Configuration**: Gene ... `<` (Inverted Left Site) ... `<` (Right Site) ... SE.\n-   **Mechanism**: The two CTCF sites are now in a tandem `(<...<)` orientation. The left-side block for a left-to-right extruding cohesin is now gone. The inverted `<` motif will not stop it. Cohesin can therefore extrude past the original boundary location, bringing the SE into spatial proximity with the gene promoter. However, the right-side `<` motif remains functional and can still block right-to-left extrusion. The loss of the `>...<` convergent anchor pairing means the boundary-defining loop is destabilized. This results in a \"leaky\" or weakened insulator.\n-   **Predicted Readouts**:\n    -   **Hi-C/Micro-C**: The original corner dot, which signifies the `>...<` loop, will be lost. Insulation is weakened, leading to a modest increase in contacts across the former boundary. A \"stripe\" may appear in the Hi-C map, emanating from the still-functional right-side anchor, reflecting its continued ability to block extrusion from one direction while the other side is variable.\n    -   **CTCF ChIP-seq**: The problem explicitly states that the motif sequence and affinity are preserved. Therefore, the CTCF protein will continue to bind to the DNA at this site, and ChIP-seq occupancy should remain at near-wild-type levels.\n    -   **Promoter Capture**: The \"leaky\" insulation allows for new, albeit non-maximal, contacts between the gene's promoter and the SE. This is partial \"enhancer adoption.\"\n    -   **mRNA Levels**: Increased contact with the SE will upregulate gene expression. Because the boundary is weakened but not abolished, the upregulation is expected to be modest, likely below the pathological threshold of $2$–$3$ fold. A change of approximately $1.4\\times$ (log$_2$ fold-change of $+0.5$) is a reasonable estimate.\n    -   **Allelic Penetrance**: The stochastic nature of loop extrusion means that in some cells (or on some alleles) the ectopic contact will be established, while in others it will not. This leads to high cell-to-cell variability in expression, which can manifest as frequent monoallelic misexpression in diploid cells.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Deletion Edit**\n-   **Configuration**: Gene ... [no site] ... `<` (Right Site) ... SE.\n-   **Mechanism**: The left-side CTCF block is completely removed. There is now no obstacle to prevent a left-to-right extruding cohesin from moving across the entire region until it is stopped by the next available boundary element or collides with another cohesin complex. This mutation effectively collapses the boundary and leads to the fusion of the gene's TAD with the SE's TAD.\n-   **Predicted Readouts**:\n    -   **Hi-C/Micro-C**: The corner dot is lost. A massive increase in contacts across the former boundary will be observed, indicative of local TAD fusion. The stripe from the right-side anchor will be much stronger and extend further leftward than in the inversion case.\n    -   **CTCF ChIP-seq**: The DNA sequence to which CTCF binds has been deleted. Consequently, CTCF ChIP-seq signal at this locus will be completely lost.\n    -   **Promoter Capture**: The physical barrier is gone, leading to robust and frequent interactions between the gene's promoter and the SE (full enhancer adoption/hijacking).\n    -   **mRNA Levels**: Strong and consistent interaction with a super-enhancer will cause a potent upregulation of the gene, likely reaching or exceeding the pathological $2$–$3$ fold threshold. A log$_2$ fold-change of $+1.5$ to $+1.7$ (approximately $2.8\\times$ to $3.2\\times$) is a plausible magnitude.\n    -   **Allelic Penetrance**: With the primary insulator gone, the misexpression effect should be strong and consistent across most cells. This would result in less cell-to-cell variability compared to the inversion and a high frequency of biallelic misexpression.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n-   **A. Inversion weakens but does not abolish insulation: Hi-C shows loss of the original corner dot with a partial stripe extending from the remaining right-side anchor and modestly increased cross-boundary contacts; CTCF ChIP-seq at the inverted site remains at near-wild-type occupancy; promoter capture shows increased but not saturated contacts between the gene and the neighboring super-enhancer; mRNA shows a modest upregulation (for example, median log$_2$ fold-change around $+0.5$, approximately $1.4\\times$), often with cell-to-cell variability and frequent monoallelic misexpression. Deletion collapses the local boundary: Hi-C loses the corner dot and shows a long stripe anchored at the right-side site with strong cross-boundary contact enrichment (local TAD fusion); CTCF ChIP-seq at the deleted site is lost; promoter capture shows robust enhancer adoption; mRNA increases strongly (for example, median log$_2$ fold-change around $+1.5$ to $+1.7$, approximately $3\\times$), frequently biallelic across cells.**\n    -   This option's description for both the inversion and deletion scenarios aligns perfectly with the predictions derived from the loop-extrusion model. Every detail, from the Hi-C features to the quantitative expression changes and allelic penetrance, is consistent with our analysis.\n    -   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **B. Inversion creates a stronger boundary by blocking extrusion from both directions: Hi-C shows a sharper corner dot and reduced cross-boundary contacts; CTCF ChIP-seq increases at the inverted site due to improved binding; promoter capture shows reduced distal contacts; mRNA decreases by about $2\\times$. Deletion leaves insulation largely intact due to compensatory right-side sites: Hi-C shows minimal change; promoter capture unaltered; mRNA remains at baseline.**\n    -   The prediction that inversion strengthens the boundary is fundamentally incorrect; a `(<...<)` tandem orientation disrupts, not enhances, boundary formation. The prediction that deletion has minimal effect is also fundamentally incorrect; deleting a dominant boundary element is a catastrophic failure of insulation.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **C. Inversion and deletion have similar, minimal effects because boundary redundancy dominates: Hi-C, promoter capture, and mRNA are largely unchanged in both edits; any changes are restricted to less than $10\\%$ of cells and show no consistent direction.**\n    -   This option dismisses the central role of the manipulated CTCF site, which contradicts both the problem statement (\"dominated by a single, high-affinity... motif\") and the known strong effects of such mutations. The loop-extrusion model predicts significant, not minimal, consequences.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D. Inversion is more disruptive than deletion because reversing orientation creates a new ectopic convergent pair that bridges the two domains: Hi-C shows a stronger, more distal corner dot with global reorganization and massive cross-boundary interactions; CTCF ChIP-seq at the inverted site is lost; promoter capture shows nearly exclusive contacts with the neighboring super-enhancer; mRNA increases by more than $5\\times$, predominantly biallelic. Deletion causes only a mild reduction in insulation with modest, sub-$1.2\\times$ expression changes.**\n    -   The claim that inversion is more disruptive than deletion is incorrect; complete removal of a block (deletion) is mechanistically more severe than reorienting it (inversion). The claim that CTCF ChIP-seq is lost at the inverted site is incorrect. The claim that deletion causes only a mild effect is incorrect.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2786799"}]}
