Also define the dimensionless enzyme activity ratio $w \\equiv V_{1}/V_{2}$. Using only the conservation relation, the MM rate expressions for the forward and reverse conversions, and the steady-state requirement that forward and reverse fluxes are equal, derive from first principles an exact closed-form expression $y^{\\ast}(w,K_{1},K_{2})$ for the steady-state fraction of modified protein.

The roots are given by the quadratic formula $y = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^{2} - 4AC}}{2A}$. For convenience, we multiply the equation by $-1$ to make the leading coefficient $(w-1)$:\n$$ (w - 1)y^{2} - [w(1 - K_{2}) - (1 + K_{1})]y - wK_{2} = 0 $$\n$$ (w - 1)y^{2} + [(1 + K_{1}) - w(1 - K_{2})]y - wK_{2} = 0 $$\nHere, $A = w-1$, $B = (1 + K_{1}) - w(1 - K_{2})$, and $C = -wK_{2}$. The solution for $y$ is:\n$$ y^{\\ast} = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^{2} - 4AC}}{2A} = \\frac{-[(1 + K_{1}) - w(1 - K_{2})] \\pm \\sqrt{[(1 + K_{1}) - w(1 - K_{2})]^{2} - 4(w-1)(-wK_{2})}}{2(w-1)} $$\n$$ y^{\\ast} = \\frac{w(1 - K_{2}) - (1 + K_{1}) \\pm \\sqrt{[(1 + K_{1}) - w(1 - K_{2})]^{2} + 4wK_{2}(w-1)}}{2(w-1)} $$\nTo select the physically meaningful root, which must satisfy $0 \\leq y^{\\ast} \\leq 1$, we examine the asymptotic limits. As $w \\to 0$, $y^{\\ast}$ must approach $0$. As $w \\to \\infty$, $y^{\\ast}$ must approach $1$. A careful analysis, as detailed in the validation, shows that the `+` sign for the radical must be chosen to satisfy these physical constraints for all $w > 0$. The resulting expression provides a unique, continuous solution for $y^{\\ast}$ across its domain. For completeness, the limit as $w \\to 1$ can be evaluated using L'Hôpital's rule on the $0/0$ form, yielding $y^{\\ast} = K_{2}/(K_{1}+K_{2})$, which matches the solution of the linear equation that results when $w=1$.\n\nNext, we address ultrasensitivity. This phenomenon is characterized by a steep, switch-like response of the output $y^{\\ast}$ to changes in the input signal $w$. We quantify this by the local sensitivity, or slope, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y^{\\ast}}{\\mathrm{d}w}$, particularly at the midpoint of the response curve, $y^{\\ast}=1/2$.\nWe find the value of $w$ corresponding to $y^{\\ast}=1/2$, denoted $w_{1/2}$, by substituting $y=1/2$ into the steady-state equation:\n$$ w_{1/2} \\frac{1 - 1/2}{K_{1} + 1 - 1/2} = \\frac{1/2}{K_{2} + 1/2} \\implies w_{1/2} \\frac{1/2}{K_{1} + 1/2} = \\frac{1/2}{K_{2} + 1/2} \\implies w_{1/2} = \\frac{K_{1} + 1/2}{K_{2} + 1/2} = \\frac{2K_{1} + 1}{2K_{2} + 1} $$\nTo find the slope, we use implicit differentiation on the steady-state relation $F(y,w) = w(1 - y)(K_{2} + y) - y(K_{1} + 1 - y) = 0$.\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}y^{\\ast}}{\\mathrm{d}w} = -\\frac{\\partial F / \\partial w}{\\partial F / \\partial y} = \\frac{(1-y)(K_{2}+y)}{w[(1-y) - (K_{2}+y)] - [(K_{1}+1-y)-y]} = \\frac{(1-y)(K_{2}+y)}{w(1-K_{2}-2y) - (K_{1}+1-2y)} $$\nEvaluating this derivative at $y^{\\ast}=1/2$ and $w=w_{1/2}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}y^{\\ast}}{\\mathrm{d}w}\\bigg|_{y^{\\ast}=1/2} = \\frac{(1/2)(K_{2}+1/2)}{w_{1/2}(1-K_{2}-1) - (K_{1}+1-1)} = \\frac{(K_{2}+1/2)/2}{-w_{1/2}K_{2} - K_{1}} $$\n$$ = \\frac{(2K_{2}+1)/4}{-\\frac{2K_{1}+1}{2K_{2}+1}K_{2} - K_{1}} = \\frac{(2K_{2}+1)/4}{-\\frac{2K_{1}K_{2}+K_{2}+K_{1}(2K_{2}+1)}{2K_{2}+1}} = \\frac{(2K_{2}+1)/4}{-\\frac{4K_{1}K_{2}+K_{1}+K_{2}}{2K_{2}+1}} = -\\frac{(2K_{2}+1)^2}{4(4K_{1}K_{2}+K_{1}+K_{2})} $$\nThe absolute value of sensitivity is what matters. Ultrasensitivity corresponds to a large value of this derivative. This occurs when the denominator is small. The term $4K_{1}K_{2}+K_{1}+K_{2}$ becomes small when both $K_{1} \\ll 1$ and $K_{2} \\ll 1$. In this limit, where both enzymes are operating near saturation with respect to their substrates (zero-order regime), the sensitivity scales as $\\approx \\frac{1}{4(K_{1}+K_{2})}$. As $K_{1}, K_{2} \\to 0$, the sensitivity approaches infinity, indicating an ideal switch. Thus, the parameter regime for ultrasensitivity is defined by $K_{1} \\ll 1$ and $K_{2} \\ll 1$.\n\nFinally, we determine if bistability can occur. Bistability requires the existence of at least two distinct stable steady states for a single set of parameters $(w, K_{1}, K_{2})$. This implies that the steady-state equation must have at least three roots in the physical domain $y \\in [0,1]$, corresponding to two stable states separated by an unstable one.\nThe steady-state equation derived above is a quadratic polynomial in $y$:\n$$ F(y) = (1 - w)y^{2} + [w(1 - K_{2}) - (1 + K_{1})]y + wK_{2} = 0 $$\nA quadratic equation can have at most two roots. This fact alone precludes the possibility of having three steady states. To be more rigorous, we examine the function $F(y)$ at the boundaries of the physical domain $y \\in [0,1]$.\nAt $y=0$:\n$$ F(0) = wK_{2} $$\nSince $w>0$ and $K_{2} = K_{M2}/S_{T} > 0$, we have $F(0) > 0$.\nAt $y=1$:\n$$ F(1) = (1-w) + [w(1-K_{2}) - (1+K_{1})] + wK_{2} = 1-w+w-wK_{2}-1-K_{1}+wK_{2} = -K_{1} $$\nSince $K_{1} = K_{M1}/S_{T} > 0$, we have $F(1) < 0$.\nThe function $F(y)$ is a continuous parabola. Since $F(0)>0$ and $F(1)<0$, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that there is at least one root in the interval $(0,1)$. Because $F(y)$ is a parabola, it can cross the y-axis only once between $y=0$ and $y=1$. The second root of the quadratic equation must lie outside this physical interval. This holds true regardless of whether the parabola opens upwards ($1-w > 0$) or downwards ($1-w < 0$).\nTherefore, for any valid set of parameters, there exists exactly one physically meaningful steady state.

The mass spectrometer measures the signal intensity for the light and heavy isotopic forms of both the phosphorylated peptide and its unphosphorylated counterpart.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles:**\n\nLet the molar amount of the phosphorylated peptide in the stimulated (light) sample be $P_s$ and in the reference (heavy) sample be $P_r$.\nLet the molar amount of the unphosphorylated (nonmodified) peptide in the stimulated (light) sample be $U_s$ and in the reference (heavy) sample be $U_r$.\n\nThe phosphorylation occupancy, $p$, is defined as the fraction of the total peptide pool that is phosphorylated:\n$$p = \\frac{P}{P + U}$$\nThus, for the stimulated and reference samples, we have:\n$$p_s = \\frac{P_s}{P_s + U_s}$$\n$$p_r = \\frac{P_r}{P_r + U_r}$$\n\nThe total amount of the site-containing peptide (phosphorylated plus unphosphorylated) in each sample is denoted by $T$:\n$$T_s = P_s + U_s$$\n$$T_r = P_r + U_r$$\n\nFrom these definitions, we can express the individual amounts in terms of total amounts and occupancies:\n$P_s = p_s T_s$ and $U_s = (1 - p_s) T_s$\n$P_r = p_r T_r$ and $U_r = (1 - p_r) T_r$\n\nAccording to the problem's assumption (ii), the mass spectrometer signal, $S$, for a given peptide is proportional to its molar amount multiplied by a response factor, $C$. This response factor depends on the chemical form of the peptide (i.e., phosphorylated vs. unphosphorylated) but is identical for light and heavy isotopologs of the same chemical form. Let $C_P$ be the response factor for the phosphorylated peptide and $C_U$ be the response factor for the unphosphorylated peptide. In general, $C_P \\neq C_U$ due to differences in ionization efficiency.\n\nThe measured signals for the four peptide species are:\n-   Signal for light phosphorylated peptide: $S_{P,s} = C_P \\cdot P_s$\n-   Signal for heavy phosphorylated peptide: $S_{P,r} = C_P \\cdot P_r$\n-   Signal for light unphosphorylated peptide: $S_{U,s} = C_U \\cdot U_s$\n-   Signal for heavy unphosphorylated peptide: $S_{U,r} = C_U \\cdot U_r$\n\nThe experiment measures the light-to-heavy signal ratios for the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides, denoted as $R_P$ and $R_U$, respectively.\nThe ratio for the phosphorylated peptide is:\n$$R_P = \\frac{S_{P,s}}{S_{P,r}} = \\frac{C_P \\cdot P_s}{C_P \\cdot P_r} = \\frac{P_s}{P_r}$$\nThe ratio for the unphosphorylated peptide is:\n$$R_U = \\frac{S_{U,s}}{S_{U,r}} = \\frac{C_U \\cdot U_s}{C_U \\cdot U_r} = \\frac{U_s}{U_r}$$\nCritically, the response factors $C_P$ and $C_U$ cancel out in these ratios. This is the key feature of the SILAC method that allows for accurate quantification independent of peptide-specific ionization efficiencies, thus fulfilling a core requirement of the problem.\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $P_s, P_r, U_s, U_r$ into the ratio equations:\n$$R_P = \\frac{p_s T_s}{p_r T_r}$$\n$$R_U = \\frac{(1 - p_s) T_s}{(1 - p_r) T_r}$$\n\nThese two equations contain the unknown ratio of total peptide amounts, $\\frac{T_s}{T_r}$. This term encapsulates both the biological change in the protein's expression level and the experimental mixing ratio of the light and heavy proteomes. To find $p_s$, we must eliminate this nuisance term. We can rearrange both equations to solve for $\\frac{T_s}{T_r}$:\nFrom the $R_P$ equation:\n$$\\frac{T_s}{T_r} = R_P \\frac{p_r}{p_s}$$\nFrom the $R_U$ equation:\n$$\\frac{T_s}{T_r} = R_U \\frac{1 - p_r}{1 - p_s}$$\n\nBy equating these two expressions for $\\frac{T_s}{T_r}$, we eliminate the unknown total amounts:\n$$R_P \\frac{p_r}{p_s} = R_U \\frac{1 - p_r}{1 - p_s}$$\nNow, we must solve this equation for $p_s$.\n$$R_P \\cdot p_r \\cdot (1 - p_s) = R_U \\cdot (1 - p_r) \\cdot p_s$$\n$$R_P p_r - R_P p_r p_s = R_U (1 - p_r) p_s$$\n$$R_P p_r = R_U (1 - p_r) p_s + R_P p_r p_s$$\n$$R_P p_r = p_s [R_U (1 - p_r) + R_P p_r]$$\n\nThis yields the final closed-form expression for $p_s$:\n$$p_s = \\frac{R_P p_r}{R_U (1 - p_r) + R_P p_r}$$\nThis expression for the phosphorylation occupancy in the stimulated sample, $p_s$, depends only on the experimentally measured ratios $R_P$ and $R_U$, and the known occupancy of the reference sample, $p_r$.\n\n**Calculation:**\nThe problem provides the following measured and known values:\n$R_P = 3.2$\n$R_U = 0.80$\n$p_r = 0.25$\n\nFirst, calculate $1 - p_r$:\n$1 - p_r = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$\n\nSubstitute these values into the derived expression:\n$$p_s = \\frac{(3.2) \\cdot (0.25)}{(0.80) \\cdot (0.75) + (3.2) \\cdot (0.25)}$$\nCalculate the terms in the numerator and denominator:\nNumerator: $3.2 \\times 0.25 = 0.8$\nDenominator term 1: $0.80 \\times 0.75 = 0.6$\nDenominator term 2: $3.2 \\times 0.25 = 0.8$\nSum of denominator terms: $0.6 + 0.8 = 1.4$\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n$$p_s = \\frac{0.8}{1.4}$$\nTo express this as an exact fraction:\n$$p_s = \\frac{0.8}{1.4} = \\frac{8}{14} = \\frac{4}{7}$$\nThe phosphorylation occupancy in the stimulated sample is precisely $\\frac{4}{7}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{4}{7}}$$", "id": "2839183"}]}
