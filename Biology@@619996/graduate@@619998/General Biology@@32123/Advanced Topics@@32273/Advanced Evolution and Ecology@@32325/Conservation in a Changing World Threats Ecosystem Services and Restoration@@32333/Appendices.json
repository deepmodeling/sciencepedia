Provide an exact value; do not round.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the ultimate extinction probability for a continuous-time linear birth-death process starting with $N_0$ individuals. The derivation must originate from foundational principles.\n\nLet $N(t)$ denote the population size at time $t$. The process starts with $N(0)=N_0$ individuals. Each individual acts independently. For a single individual, a birth event occurs at rate $\\lambda$, increasing the population by one, and a death event occurs at rate $\\mu$, decreasing the population by one. The total time until the next event for a single individual is an exponentially distributed random variable with rate $\\lambda+\\mu$.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the **branching property**: the lineages descending from the initial $N_0$ individuals are independent and statistically identical. Therefore, if we find the ultimate extinction probability, let us call it $q_{ext}$, for a process starting with a single individual ($N_0=1$), then the extinction probability for a process starting with $N_0$ individuals will be $(q_{ext})^{N_0}$. Our first objective is to compute $q_{ext}$.\n\nLet us consider a single lineage starting with $N(0)=1$. The first event will be either a birth or a death. The probability that the event is a birth is $p_{birth} = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda+\\mu}$. If a birth occurs, the population size becomes $2$. The probability that the event is a death is $p_{death} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda+\\mu}$. If a death occurs, the population size becomes $0$, and the lineage is extinct.\n\nThis formulation allows us to consider the embedded discrete-time generation process. Let $g(s)$ be the probability generating function (PGF) of the number of \"offspring\" after one event. An \"offspring\" count of $2$ occurs with probability $p_{birth}$, and an \"offspring\" count of $0$ occurs with probability $p_{death}$.\nThe PGF is therefore given by:\n$$ g(s) = p_{death} \\cdot s^0 + p_{birth} \\cdot s^2 = \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda+\\mu} + \\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda+\\mu} s^2 = \\frac{\\mu + \\lambda s^2}{\\lambda+\\mu} $$\n\nA foundational result in branching process theory states that the ultimate extinction probability, $q_{ext}$, is the smallest non-negative root of the equation $g(s) = s$. Let us solve this equation for our process:\n$$ s = \\frac{\\mu + \\lambda s^2}{\\lambda+\\mu} $$\nRearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic equation for $s$:\n$$ s(\\lambda+\\mu) = \\mu + \\lambda s^2 $$\n$$ \\lambda s^2 - (\\lambda+\\mu)s + \\mu = 0 $$\n\nWe can find the roots of this quadratic equation. We observe that $s=1$ is always a root:\n$$ \\lambda (1)^2 - (\\lambda+\\mu)(1) + \\mu = \\lambda - \\lambda - \\mu + \\mu = 0 $$\nSince $s=1$ is a root, $(s-1)$ must be a factor of the polynomial. We can perform polynomial division or factor by inspection:\n$$ \\lambda s^2 - \\lambda s - \\mu s + \\mu = \\lambda s (s-1) - \\mu(s-1) = (\\lambda s - \\mu)(s-1) = 0 $$\nThe two roots of the equation $g(s)=s$ are therefore $s_1=1$ and $s_2=\\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda}$.\n\nThe ultimate extinction probability $q_{ext}$ is the smallest non-negative root. We must compare the two roots, $1$ and $\\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda}$.\n\nCase 1: Subcritical or critical process ($\\mu \\ge \\lambda$).\nIn this case, $\\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda} \\ge 1$. The smallest non-negative root is $s=1$. Thus, the extinction probability for a single lineage is $q_{ext}=1$. Extinction is certain.\n\nCase 2: Supercritical process ($\\mu < \\lambda$).\nIn this case, $0 < \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda} < 1$. The smallest non-negative root is $s=\\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda}$. Thus, the extinction probability for a single lineage is $q_{ext}=\\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda}$. Extinction is not certain; there is a non-zero probability of survival.\n\nWe can combine these two cases into a single expression for the extinction probability of a single lineage:\n$$ q_{ext} = \\min\\left(1, \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda}\\right) $$\n\nNow, we return to the initial problem with $N(0)=N_0$ individuals. Because of the branching property asserting independence of lineages, the entire population goes extinct if and only if all $N_0$ independent lineages started by each of the initial individuals go extinct. The probability of this compound event is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$ \\pi_{ext}(\\lambda, \\mu, N_0) = (q_{ext})^{N_0} = \\left( \\min\\left(1, \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda}\\right) \\right)^{N_0} $$\nThis is the general formula for the ultimate extinction probability.\n\nFinally, we must evaluate this expression for the given parameters: $\\lambda=0.9$, $\\mu=1.1$, and $N_0=10$.\nFirst, we compare the rates $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$:\n$$ \\lambda = 0.9, \\quad \\mu = 1.1 $$\nSince $1.1 > 0.9$, we have $\\mu > \\lambda$. The process is subcritical.\nWe calculate the ratio $\\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda} = \\frac{1.1}{0.9} = \\frac{11}{9} $$\nSince $\\frac{11}{9} > 1$, the extinction probability for a single lineage is:\n$$ q_{ext} = \\min\\left(1, \\frac{11}{9}\\right) = 1 $$\nThe total extinction probability for the population starting with $N_0=10$ individuals is:\n$$ \\pi_{ext} = (q_{ext})^{N_0} = (1)^{10} = 1 $$\nThe probability of ultimate extinction for this population is exactly $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2788833"}, {"introduction": "While single-population models are instructive, most species exist as a network of interconnected populations, or a metapopulation.
