Starting only from the following foundational facts: (i) in a diploid population there are $2N$ gene copies per site that can mutate each generation, (ii) the expected number of new neutral mutations entering the population per site per generation is determined by the product of the number of gene copies and the per-copy neutral mutation rate, and (iii) under neutrality the fixation probability of a newly arisen allele equals its initial frequency, derive from first principles an expression for the expected number of neutral fixations per site accumulated over $T$ generations in terms of $N$, $\\mu$, and $T$. Then evaluate this expression for the given values of $N$, $\\mu$, and $T$. Finally, briefly interpret your numerical result in terms of whether the accumulation of neutral substitutions is clock-like. Express the expected number per site as a unitless decimal number. No rounding is required beyond exact arithmetic.", "solution": "Let $N$ be the effective population size of a diploid population. Let $\\mu$ be the per-site, per-generation neutral mutation rate. The time interval under consideration is $T$ generations.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the expected number of neutral substitutions, or fixations, per site over the time interval $T$. We will denote the rate of neutral substitution per site per generation as $K$. The total expected number of fixations will therefore be $K \\times T$.\n\nWe follow the foundational facts provided:\n\n1.  **Rate of new neutral mutations:**\n    Fact (i) states that in a diploid population of size $N$, there are $2N$ gene copies at any given autosomal locus.\n    Fact (ii) states that the expected number of new neutral mutations entering the population per site per generation is the product of the number of gene copies and the per-copy neutral mutation rate.\n    Let this rate of introduction of new mutations be $\\lambda$.\n    $$ \\lambda = (2N) \\times \\mu = 2N\\mu $$\n    This expression represents the total number of new neutral alleles that arise at a specific site within the entire population in one generation.\n\n2.  **Probability of fixation of a new neutral mutation:**\n    A new mutation initially exists as a single copy in the population. The total number of gene copies at that site is $2N$. Therefore, the initial frequency of this new allele, let us call it $p_0$, is:\n    $$ p_0 = \\frac{1}{2N} $$\n    Fact (iii) states that under neutrality (i.e., the allele has no selective advantage or disadvantage), its probability of eventually reaching fixation (a frequency of $1$) is equal to its initial frequency. Let this probability be $P_{fix}$.\n    $$ P_{fix} = p_0 = \\frac{1}{2N} $$\n\n3.  **Rate of neutral substitution:**\n    The rate of neutral substitution, $K$, is the rate at which new neutral mutations arise *and* subsequently proceed to fixation. This is the product of the rate of introduction of new neutral mutations ($\\lambda$) and the probability that any one of them becomes fixed ($P_{fix}$).\n    $$ K = \\lambda \\times P_{fix} $$\n    Substituting the expressions we derived:\n    $$ K = (2N\\mu) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2N}\\right) $$\n    The term $2N$ cancels out, leading to a remarkably simple result:\n    $$ K = \\mu $$\n    This is a cornerstone result of the neutral theory: the rate of substitution of neutral alleles is equal to the neutral mutation rate and is independent of the effective population size.\n\n4.  **Total expected number of fixations over time $T$:**\n    The total expected number of neutral fixations per site over a period of $T$ generations is the rate of substitution per generation, $K$, multiplied by the number of generations, $T$.\n    $$ \\text{Total Fixations} = K \\times T = \\mu T $$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the numerical values provided in the problem:\n$N = 10^{5}$\n$\\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-8}$\n$T = 10^{7}$\n\nThe total expected number of neutral fixations per site is:\n$$ \\text{Total Fixations} = (1 \\times 10^{-8}) \\times (10^{7}) = 10^{-8+7} = 10^{-1} = 0.1 $$\n\nFinally, we must interpret this result in the context of the molecular clock. The derivation shows that the rate of accumulation of neutral substitutions, $K$, is equal to the neutral mutation rate, $\\mu$. Crucially, this rate is independent of the effective population size $N$. If the mutation rate $\\mu$ is assumed to be approximately constant over evolutionary time for a given gene or genomic region, then the rate of substitution $K$ will also be constant. The accumulation of substitutions will therefore occur at a steady, clock-like pace. The calculation shows that over $T = 10^{7}$ generations, we expect $0.1$ substitutions to have occurred and become fixed at any given neutral site. This regularity, stemming from the independence of the substitution rate from demographic parameters like population size, is the theoretical foundation of the molecular clock.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1}$$", "id": "2818739"}, {"introduction": "With the theoretical relationship between substitution rate and mutation rate established, we can now apply it to estimate evolutionary divergence times from sequence data. However, observed sequence differences are not a direct measure of substitutions, as multiple changes at the same site can obscure the true evolutionary history.

It assumes that all substitutions occur with equal probability. The relationship between the observed proportion of different sites, $p$, and the expected number of substitutions per site, $D$, is given by the formula:\n$$D = -\\frac{3}{4} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{4}{3}p\\right)$$\nThis correction accounts for multiple substitutions at a single site over evolutionary time, which are not captured by a simple pairwise comparison.\n\nWe are given $p = 0.15$.

The quantity $D$ represents the total number of substitutions per site along the two lineages that diverged from a common ancestor.

This raw distance systematically underestimates the actual number of evolutionary events because it fails to account for multiple substitutions occurring at the same nucleotide site over time. For example, a change from A to G followed by a change from G back to A results in zero observable difference, yet two substitutions have occurred. Similarly, a change from A to G followed by a change to T is counted as one difference (A vs T), but two substitutions have happened. The JC69 formula corrects for these \"multiple hits,\" providing an estimate $D$ that is always greater than $p$ for $p > 0$. Since the divergence time $T$ is directly proportional to the distance ($T = D/(2\\mu)$), using the corrected distance $D$ leads to a longer, and therefore more accurate, estimate of the divergence time than would be obtained by naively using the uncorrected proportion $p$. Using $p$ in place of $D$ would necessarily result in an underestimation of the true evolutionary time.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.1674  41.8 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2818705"}, {"introduction": "Real-world sequence analysis often involves protein-coding genes where evolutionary pressure varies across sites, leading to different substitution dynamics.
