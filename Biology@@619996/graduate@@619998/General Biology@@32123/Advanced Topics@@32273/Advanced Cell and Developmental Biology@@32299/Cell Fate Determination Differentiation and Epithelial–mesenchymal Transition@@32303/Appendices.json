This exercise explores the consequences of random partitioning for a key fate determinant, a common scenario in asymmetric cell division.

There is no synthesis or degradation during mitosis, and the mitotic spindle is fixed so that one labeled daughter cell has a constant size asymmetry that yields an independent per-molecule probability $p \\in (0,1)$ of entering the labeled daughter at cytokinesis. The determinant acts in a threshold manner: a daughter adopts fate A (epithelial) only if it receives at least $T$ molecules, where $T$ is an integer with $1 \\leq T \\leq N$. Using only first principles of stochastic partitioning and independence, derive an exact expression, in closed form, for the probability that the labeled daughter receives fewer than $T$ molecules of the determinant at division.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of stochastic processes in biology, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It describes a classic scenario of binomial partitioning, for which a unique analytical solution can be derived. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that a specific daughter cell, which we will call the labeled daughter, inherits fewer than $T$ molecules of a fate determinant, given a total of $N$ molecules in the parent cell. Let $K$ be the random variable representing the number of determinant molecules that partition into the labeled daughter cell.\n\nThe segregation of each of the $N$ molecules is an independent event. For any single molecule, the probability of it entering the labeled daughter cell is given as $p$. Consequently, the probability of it entering the other, unlabeled daughter cell is $1-p$. This process can be modeled as a sequence of $N$ independent Bernoulli trials, where a \"success\" corresponds to a molecule entering the labeled daughter cell.\n\nThe total number of successes, $K$, in $N$ independent Bernoulli trials follows a binomial distribution. The parameters of this distribution are the number of trials, $n=N$, and the probability of success in a single trial, $p$. The probability mass function (PMF) of this distribution, which gives the probability that the labeled daughter receives exactly $k$ molecules, is given by:\n$$P(K=k) = \\binom{N}{k} p^k (1-p)^{N-k}$$\nHere, $k$ is an integer representing the number of molecules, where $0 \\leq k \\leq N$. The term $\\binom{N}{k}$ is the binomial coefficient, calculated as $\\frac{N!}{k!(N-k)!}$, which counts the number of distinct ways to choose $k$ molecules out of the total $N$ to enter the labeled cell.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the probability that the labeled daughter receives *fewer than* $T$ molecules. This corresponds to the event $K < T$. Since $K$ must be an integer, this event is equivalent to the set of outcomes where $K$ can be $0, 1, 2, \\ldots, T-1$. Because these outcomes are mutually exclusive, the total probability is the sum of their individual probabilities.\n\nWe express this as a cumulative probability:\n$$P(K < T) = \\sum_{k=0}^{T-1} P(K=k)$$\nSubstituting the binomial PMF into this summation, we obtain the exact expression for the desired probability:\n$$P(K < T) = \\sum_{k=0}^{T-1} \\binom{N}{k} p^k (1-p)^{N-k}$$\nThis expression is a finite sum and constitutes a closed-form solution in terms of the given parameters $N$, $T$, and $p$. The constraints $1 \\leq T \\leq N$ ensure that the summation is well-defined. For $T=1$, the sum is for $k=0$ only, yielding $(1-p)^N$, the correct probability of receiving zero molecules. For $T>N$, the sum would extend to $k=N$, and the probability would be $1$, but this is outside the specified domain for $T$.

Under neutral culture conditions, each progenitor makes an initial fate decision independently with fixed probability $p_{0} = 0.7$ for lineage A and $1 - p_{0} = 0.3$ for lineage B. A morphogen is added, and you wish to determine whether it biases initial fate determination (changes the probability of choosing lineage A at the time of fate commitment) versus merely alters downstream proliferation after fate commitment.\n\nYou perform a two-timepoint experiment: at an early timepoint $t_{1}$, before any cell has divided, you read out fate commitment using immediate early markers of lineage identity, obtaining direct counts of initial fate decisions; at a later timepoint $t_{2}$, you assess total cell numbers per lineage, which may reflect proliferation differences. In one replicate under morphogen, at $t_{1}$ you observe $n = 40$ committed cells in total, of which $k = 34$ are committed to lineage A.\n\nUsing only the early-timepoint counts $(k, n)$ and starting from the definition of the Bernoulli process and the binomial probability mass function, construct a test of the null hypothesis $H_{0}$ that the morphogen does not bias fate determination (that is, the probability of choosing A at commitment remains $p_{0} = 0.7$) versus the composite alternative $H_{1}$ that the morphogen biases fate determination (that is, the probability of choosing A at commitment is some $p \\neq 0.7$).

This constitutes a sequence of $n$ independent Bernoulli trials. Let $p$ be the probability that a cell commits to lineage A (a \"success\"). The probability of not choosing lineage A is then $1-p$. The probability of observing exactly $k$ cells committing to lineage A in a total of $n$ cells is given by the binomial probability mass function:\n$$\nP(K=k \\,|\\, n, p) = \\binom{n}{k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}\n$$\nThe likelihood function, $L(p\\,|\\,k,n)$, is the probability of observing the data $(k,n)$ as a function of the parameter $p$.

Now we substitute the expression for the log-likelihood function:\n$$\nS = 2 \\left[ \\left(\\ln\\binom{n}{k} + k \\ln(\\hat{p}) + (n-k) \\ln(1-\\hat{p})\\right) - \\left(\\ln\\binom{n}{k} + k \\ln(p_{0}) + (n-k) \\ln(1-p_{0})\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThe constant term $\\ln\\binom{n}{k}$ cancels out, simplifying the expression significantly:\n$$\nS = 2 \\left[ k \\ln(\\hat{p}) + (n-k) \\ln(1-\\hat{p}) - k \\ln(p_{0}) - (n-k) \\ln(1-p_{0}) \\right]\n$$\nGrouping terms by the coefficients $k$ and $(n-k)$:\n$$\nS = 2 \\left[ k \\left(\\ln(\\hat{p}) - \\ln(p_{0})\\right) + (n-k) \\left(\\ln(1-\\hat{p}) - \\ln(1-p_{0})\\right) \\right]\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$:\n$$\nS = 2 \\left[ k \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\hat{p}}{p_{0}}\\right) + (n-k) \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-\\hat{p}}{1-p_{0}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided in the problem.\nGiven data: $n=40$, $k=34$.\nThe MLE is $\\hat{p} = \\frac{k}{n} = \\frac{34}{40} = 0.85$.\nThe null hypothesis value is $p_{0}=0.7$.\nWe also have $n-k = 40-34 = 6$, $1-\\hat{p} = 1-0.85 = 0.15$, and $1-p_0 = 1-0.7=0.3$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $S$:\n$$\nS = 2 \\left[ 34 \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.85}{0.7}\\right) + 6 \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.15}{0.3}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nWe evaluate the terms numerically:\n$$\n\\frac{0.85}{0.7} \\approx 1.2142857\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{0.15}{0.3} = 0.5\n$$\n$$\nS = 2 \\left[ 34 \\ln(1.2142857...) + 6 \\ln(0.5) \\right]\n$$\nUsing the natural logarithm values:\n$$\n\\ln(1.2142857...) \\approx 0.1941560\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(0.5) \\approx -0.6931472\n$$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $S$:\n$$\nS \\approx 2 \\left[ 34 \\times (0.1941560) + 6 \\times (-0.6931472) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nS \\approx 2 \\left[ 6.601304 - 4.1588832 \\right]\n$$\n$$\nS \\approx 2 \\left[ 2.4424208 \\right]\n$$\n$$\nS \\approx 4.8848416\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nS \\approx 4.885\n$$\nThis value of $S$ follows a chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom, $\\chi^2(1)$, under the null hypothesis. A value of $4.885$ corresponds to a p-value of approximately $0.027$, suggesting that the null hypothesis should be rejected at the $\\alpha=0.05$ significance level. However, the calculation of the p-value is not requested. The requested output is solely the numerical value of $S$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.885}$$", "id": "2782489"}]}
