To understand the direct consequence of this change, we can model the interaction using fundamental principles of receptor-ligand binding. This exercise allows you to quantitatively connect a change in the dissociation constant ($K_d$), a core measure of binding affinity, to the fold-increase in drug concentration required to maintain the same level of target engagement, providing a clear link between a molecular event and its pharmacological impact [@problem_id:2776114].", "problem": "A single-site antibiotic–enzyme interaction underlies drug efficacy in a bacterial pathogen. Let the enzyme be the receptor species with total concentration denoted by $R_{t}$, the free enzyme by $R$, the antibiotic by $L$, and the drug–enzyme complex by $RL$. The antibiotic binds competitively at one site with no cooperativity and rapid equilibrium is attained. The dissociation constant (defined by the law of mass action) is $K_{d} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$. Assume a well-mixed system, negligible receptor depletion so that the free drug concentration equals the total drug concentration (that is, $[L]$ is effectively unaffected by binding because $[L] \\gg R_{t}$), and no non-specific binding.\n\nA resistance mutation reduces drug affinity for the enzyme without altering $R_{t}$. In the wild type, the measured dissociation constant is $K_{d}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{M}$, and in the resistant mutant it is $K_{d}^{\\mathrm{Mut}} = 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M}$.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It describes a standard model of ligand-receptor binding at equilibrium. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system is governed by three fundamental relationships: the conservation of total enzyme (receptor) concentration, the definition of the dissociation constant, and the definition of fractional occupancy.\n\nThe total concentration of the enzyme, $R_{t}$, is the sum of the free enzyme concentration, $[R]$, and the concentration of the antibiotic-bound enzyme complex, $[RL]$. This is the equation of mass balance for the receptor:\n$$R_{t} = [R] + [RL]$$\n\nThe dissociation constant, $K_{d}$, is defined by the law of mass action for the reversible binding process $R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\nwhere $[L]$ is the concentration of the free antibiotic (ligand). The problem specifies that $[L]$ is effectively the total antibiotic concentration due to negligible receptor depletion.\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $f$, is defined as the fraction of the total enzyme population that is bound to the antibiotic:\n$$f = \\frac{[RL]}{R_{t}}$$\nThe problem requires that we first derive an expression for $[L]$ as a function of $K_{d}$ and $f$. We will manipulate these three equations algebraically.\n\nFrom the definition of fractional occupancy, we express $[RL]$ in terms of $R_{t}$ and $f$:\n$$[RL] = f \\cdot R_{t}$$\nNext, we substitute this into the mass balance equation to find an expression for the free enzyme concentration, $[R]$:\n$$R_{t} = [R] + f \\cdot R_{t}$$\n$$[R] = R_{t} - f \\cdot R_{t} = R_{t}(1 - f)$$\nNow we have expressions for both $[R]$ and $[RL]$ in terms of $R_{t}$ and $f$. We substitute these into the definition of the dissociation constant $K_{d}$:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]} = \\frac{(R_{t}(1 - f))[L]}{f \\cdot R_{t}}$$\nThe term for the total enzyme concentration, $R_{t}$, appears in both the numerator and the denominator, and thus it cancels out. This is expected, as the relationship between $f$, $[L]$, and $K_d$ should be independent of the total amount of enzyme.\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{(1 - f)[L]}{f}$$\nThis equation is a standard form of the Langmuir isotherm. To complete the first part of the problem, we rearrange this equation to solve for $[L]$:\n$$K_{d} \\cdot f = (1 - f)[L]$$\n$$[L] = K_{d} \\frac{f}{1 - f}$$\nThis is the required expression for the free antibiotic concentration $[L]$ needed to achieve a fractional occupancy $f$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the fold-increase in $[L]$ required for a resistant mutant to achieve the same fractional occupancy $f$ as the wild type. Let $[L]_{\\mathrm{WT}}$ be the concentration required for the wild-type enzyme, which has a dissociation constant $K_{d}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$, and let $[L]_{\\mathrm{Mut}}$ be the concentration required for the mutant enzyme, with dissociation constant $K_{d}^{\\mathrm{Mut}}$.\n\nUsing the derived formula for $[L]$:\n$$[L]_{\\mathrm{WT}} = K_{d}^{\\mathrm{WT}} \\frac{f}{1 - f}$$\n$$[L]_{\\mathrm{Mut}} = K_{d}^{\\mathrm{Mut}} \\frac{f}{1 - f}$$\nThe fold-increase is the ratio of these two concentrations:\n$$\\text{Fold-increase} = \\frac{[L]_{\\mathrm{Mut}}}{[L]_{\\mathrm{WT}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions above:\n$$\\text{Fold-increase} = \\frac{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{Mut}} \\frac{f}{1 - f}}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{WT}} \\frac{f}{1 - f}}$$\nThe problem states that we are comparing the concentrations needed to achieve the *same* fractional occupancy $f$. The condition $0 < f < 1$ ensures that the term $\\frac{f}{1 - f}$ is a finite, positive number. Therefore, this term cancels out from the numerator and denominator.\n$$\\text{Fold-increase} = \\frac{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{Mut}}}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{WT}}}$$\nThis result demonstrates that for any given level of target engagement $f$, the required drug concentration scales directly with the dissociation constant.\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values for the dissociation constants:\n$K_{d}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{M}$\n$K_{d}^{\\mathrm{Mut}} = 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M}$\n\n$$\\text{Fold-increase} = \\frac{10^{-6}}{10^{-8}} = 10^{-6 - (-8)} = 10^{2} = 100$$\nThus, a $100$-fold increase in the drug concentration is required for the mutant to achieve the same fractional enzyme occupancy as the wild type.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of enzyme kinetics, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and expressed in objective, formal language. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the per-enzyme turnover frequency, which is the steady-state velocity of the reaction catalyzed by a single enzyme molecule at a given substrate concentration. This quantity, which we shall denote as $v$, is described by the Michaelis-Menten equation under the quasi-steady-state assumption. The equation relates the reaction velocity to the substrate concentration $[S]$, the catalytic constant $k_{cat}$, and the Michaelis constant $K_{M}$.\n\nThe Michaelis-Menten equation for the per-enzyme turnover rate is given by:\n$$\nv = \\frac{k_{cat} [S]}{K_{M} + [S]}\n$$\nHere, $k_{cat}$ represents the maximum possible turnover frequency, which occurs at saturating substrate concentrations (i.e., when $[S] \\gg K_{M}$).

The $\\beta$-lactamase is located in the bacterial periplasm, the space between the inner and outer membranes. The antibiotic must diffuse from the external environment, cross the outer membrane via porins, and traverse the periplasm to reach its targets, the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located on the outer surface of the inner cytoplasmic membrane.\n\nThe calculated high turnover frequency ($v = 133 \\text{ s}^{-1}$) means the $\\beta$-lactamase acts as a highly efficient sink for the antibiotic within the periplasm. As antibiotic molecules diffuse into this space, they are rapidly intercepted and destroyed by the enzyme. From first principles of mass transport, this enzymatic reaction creates a steep antibiotic concentration gradient across the periplasm. The rate of destruction competes with the rate of diffusion. If the enzymatic destruction rate is sufficiently high relative to the influx rate of the antibiotic into the periplasm, the local concentration of the intact antibiotic in the vicinity of the PBPs will be maintained at a level far below the external concentration, and potentially below the threshold required for effective target inhibition. This \"periplasmic barrier\" effect, driven by the kinetic efficiency of the enzyme ($k_{cat}$ and $K_M$) and its concentration, is a primary mechanism of antibiotic resistance, as it prevents the drug from reaching its site of action in sufficient quantity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{133}$$", "id": "2776127"}, {"introduction": "The emergence of resistance within a patient is not just a function of molecular mechanisms, but also of drug concentration dynamics over time (pharmacokinetics).
