Consider the spherical tiling by pentagons and hexagons that represents the capsomere arrangement. In such a tiling, exactly $3$ faces meet at each vertex, so each vertex is incident to $3$ faces. If $V$ is the number of vertices and $E$ the number of edges, then each edge is shared by $2$ faces and each vertex is shared by $3$ faces. Therefore, counting incidences gives two standard relations:\n- Counting face-edge incidences: $5P + 6H = 2E$.\n- Counting face-vertex incidences: $3V = 2E$.\n\nWe also have Euler’s characteristic for the sphere,\n$$\nV - E + F = 2.\n$$\nUsing $3V = 2E$, we write $V = \\frac{2E}{3}$.

It is scientifically grounded, internally consistent, and contains all necessary information to compute a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid. We proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the relationship between the applied normal force $F$ and the indentation depth $\\delta$ for the contact between two elastic spheres, and subsequently the calculation of the Young's modulus $E$ of the virus. This falls under the domain of Hertzian contact theory, which is built upon the principles of linear elasticity, geometric compatibility, and force balance for small, frictionless, non-adhesive deformations.\n\nLet the two contacting bodies be indexed as $1$ (the virus) and $2$ (the AFM tip). They are characterized by their radii ($R_1 = R_{\\mathrm{v}}$, $R_2 = R_{\\mathrm{p}}$), Young's moduli ($E_1 = E$, $E_2 = E_{\\mathrm{p}}$), and Poisson's ratios ($\\nu_1 = \\nu$, $\\nu_2 = \\nu_{\\mathrm{p}}$).\n\nThe core of Hertz theory lies in relating the geometry of contact to the elastic response of the materials.\n1.  **Geometric Compatibility**: For small indentations ($\\delta \\ll R_1, R_2$), the contact creates a circular patch of radius $a$. The relationship between the indentation depth $\\delta$, the contact radius $a$, and the effective radius of curvature $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is purely geometric:\n    $$ \\delta = \\frac{a^2}{R_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$$\n    The effective radius $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is defined by the curvature of the two contacting surfaces:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} = \\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{v}}} + \\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{p}}} $$\n\n2.  **Elastic Response and Force Balance**: The pressure distribution $p(r)$ over the circular contact area (where $r$ is the radial distance from the center of contact) is found from elasticity theory to be semi-ellipsoidal:\n    $$ p(r) = p_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^2} $$\n    where $p_0$ is the maximum pressure at the center ($r=0$).
