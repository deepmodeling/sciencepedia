A transient pulse of DSBs is induced at time $t=0$. Consider the following widely accepted bases: (i) binding of DNA end-binding factors is governed by the law of mass action, so that the association rate for a factor $X$ with free DNA ends is proportional to $k_{\\mathrm{on},X}[X][E_{\\mathrm{free}}]$, where $[X]$ is the concentration of factor $X$ and $[E_{\\mathrm{free}}]$ is the concentration of free DNA ends; (ii) Ku70/80 heterodimer (Ku) binds naked DNA ends and recruits DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) to form the DNA-PK holoenzyme; the instantaneous rate of DNA-PKcs loading is proportional to the amount of Ku-bound ends; (iii) the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex also binds DNA ends and can initiate end processing, but extensive resection requires CtBP-interacting protein (CtIP) phosphorylation by CDKs, which is minimal in $G_1$; (iv) p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) and related factors in $G_1$ oppose long-range resection; (v) MRN binding can occur even when resection is limited.

The roles of Ku, DNA-PKcs, MRN, CDKs, CtIP, and 53BP1 are accurately described. The use of mass-action kinetics to model protein-DNA binding is a standard and valid approach in systems biology.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

The question asks for a qualitative prediction, which is derivable from the provided principles.\n- **Objective**: The language is technical and precise. It is free from subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Consistency and Completeness**: The provided bases (i-v) are mutually consistent and provide sufficient information to deduce the outcome. The framing of a kinetic competition between Ku and MRN for a common substrate (DNA ends) is logical.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. It is a valid problem. We may proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe core of the problem is the competition between two protein complexes, Ku and MRN, for binding to a limited number of free DNA ends, $[E_{\\mathrm{free}}]$, generated at $t=0$.\n\n1. According to basis (i), the rates of binding for Ku and MRN are given by mass-action kinetics:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{Ku}} = k_{\\mathrm{on,Ku}}[\\mathrm{Ku}][E_{\\mathrm{free}}]$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{MRN}} = k_{\\mathrm{on,MRN}}[\\mathrm{MRN}][E_{\\mathrm{free}}]$$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{on,Ku}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{on,MRN}}$ are the respective association rate constants.\n\n2. The experimental perturbation is a reduction of the Ku concentration by $50\\%$. The new concentration is $[\\mathrm{Ku}]' = 0.5\\,[\\mathrm{Ku}]$. The concentration of MRN, $[\\mathrm{MRN}]$, is unchanged.\n\n3. The new rate of Ku binding, $R'_{\\mathrm{Ku}}$, becomes:\n$$R'_{\\mathrm{Ku}} = k_{\\mathrm{on,Ku}}([\\mathrm{Ku}]')[E_{\\mathrm{free}}] = k_{\\mathrm{on,Ku}}(0.5\\,[\\mathrm{Ku}])[E_{\\mathrm{free}}] = 0.5\\,R_{\\mathrm{Ku}}$$\nThe rate of Ku binding to free DNA ends is halved at any given concentration of free ends.\n\n4. **Effect on DNA-PKcs Recruitment:**\nBasis (ii) states that the instantaneous rate of DNA-PKcs loading is proportional to the concentration of Ku-bound ends, $[E_{\\mathrm{Ku}}]$. The rate of formation of Ku-bound ends, $\\frac{d[E_{\\mathrm{Ku}}]}{dt}$, is primarily driven by $R'_{\\mathrm{Ku}}$. Since $R'_{\\mathrm{Ku}}$ is reduced, the accumulation of Ku-bound ends will be slower. Consequently, the **initial rate of DNA-PKcs recruitment will decrease**.\nFurthermore, Ku and MRN are in competition. The fraction of ends ultimately captured by Ku depends on the relative rates. Initially, this fraction is proportional to $\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{Ku}}}{R_{\\mathrm{Ku}} + R_{\\mathrm{MRN}}}$. After the perturbation, this fraction becomes proportional to $\\frac{R'_{\\mathrm{Ku}}}{R'_{\\mathrm{Ku}} + R_{\\mathrm{MRN}}} = \\frac{0.5\\,R_{\\mathrm{Ku}}}{0.5\\,R_{\\mathrm{Ku}} + R_{\\mathrm{MRN}}}$. This value is smaller than the original fraction. A smaller total number of Ku-bound ends means that the **peak amplitude (or steady-state level) of recruited DNA-PKcs will also decrease**.\n\n5. **Effect on Competition and MRN Binding:**\nWith Ku binding being less efficient ($R'_{\\mathrm{Ku}}  R_{\\mathrm{Ku}}$), Ku is a weaker competitor against MRN for the available free ends. This has two consequences:\n- The total rate of consumption of free ends, $R'_{\\text{total}} = R'_{\\mathrm{Ku}} + R_{\\mathrm{MRN}}$, is lower than the original rate $R_{\\text{total}} = R_{\\mathrm{Ku}} + R_{\\mathrm{MRN}}$. This implies that free ends will persist for a longer duration, leading to a **higher time-averaged concentration of $[E_{\\mathrm{free}}]$**.\n- Since MRN faces less competition from Ku, the **fraction of ends captured by MRN will increase**.\n\n6. **Overall Pathway Outcome in $G_1$:**\nThe problem is set in $G_1$ phase, where HR is suppressed (basis iii and iv). Even though MRN binding to ends increases, the lack of CDK-mediated CtIP phosphorylation and the presence of the 53BP1 block prevent extensive end resection. Therefore, the pathway is not shunted into HR. The primary consequence of increased MRN binding and delayed canonical NHEJ (due to slower DNA-PKcs recruitment) is a potential shift towards alternative repair pathways, such as alternative end joining (alt-EJ) or microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), which can be initiated by MRN but do not require extensive resection. This also implies a **delay in the overall completion of NHEJ**.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The initial rate and peak amplitude of DNA-PKcs recruitment both decrease because Ku-dependent end occupancy rises more slowly when $[\\mathrm{Ku}]$ is halved; the fraction of ends initially captured by MRN increases due to a higher time-averaged $[E_{\\mathrm{free}}]$, but resection remains limited in $G_1$, leading to a modest delay in NHEJ initiation and a slight increase in alternative end joining.**\n- This statement accurately captures all consequences derived from first principles. The initial rate and peak of DNA-PKcs recruitment decrease. MRN captures a larger fraction of ends. The time-averaged $[E_{\\mathrm{free}}]$ increases. Resection remains blocked in $G_1$. The outcome is a delay in NHEJ and a potential increase in alt-EJ. This analysis is fully consistent with our derivation.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. DNA-PKcs recruitment accelerates because fewer Ku molecules reduces Ku-dependent sequestration of DNA-PKcs in the nucleoplasm, thereby increasing its availability at ends; MRN binding correspondingly decreases since DNA-PKcs now outcompetes MRN for free ends in $G_1$.**\n- The central claim that recruitment *accelerates* is incorrect. The rate-limiting step for recruitment is the formation of the Ku-DNA complex, which is slowed by the reduction in $[\\mathrm{Ku}]$. The \"sequestration\" argument is a speculative mechanism that contradicts the explicit premise that recruitment rate is proportional to Ku-bound ends.\n- The claim that MRN binding *decreases* is also incorrect. With its primary competitor weakened, MRN binding should increase.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. DNA-PKcs recruitment slows because of reduced Ku, but MRN engagement is essentially unchanged in $G_1$ since MRN requires CtIP activity to bind ends; competition for ends is therefore unaffected despite the Ku reduction.**\n- The first clause (\"DNA-PKcs recruitment slows\") is correct. However, the reasoning that follows is flawed.\n- The premise \"MRN requires CtIP activity to bind ends\" is factually incorrect as stated in the problem (basis v: \"MRN binding can occur even when resection is limited\") and in established biology. CtIP activity is required for *extensive resection*, not for the initial binding of MRN.\n- Because MRN binding is not prevented and the concentration of its competitor (Ku) is halved, the competition is necessarily affected.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. No appreciable change occurs in DNA-PKcs recruitment kinetics or MRN competition because end binding is diffusion-limited and, at physiological concentrations, both Ku and MRN saturate DNA ends; $G_1$-specific suppression of resection ensures the dynamics remain the same even when Ku is reduced by $50\\%$.**\n- This option introduces the assumption of saturation kinetics, which contradicts the mass-action kinetics specified in basis (i) of the problem statement ($rate \\propto [X][E_{\\mathrm{free}}]$). The problem must be solved using the given framework.\n- Even if saturation were a possibility, assuming that halving the concentration of Ku still leaves it in a saturating regime is a strong, unsupported claim, especially during the \"early kinetics\" after a \"transient pulse\" of damage, where the number of ends might be very high.\n- Claiming \"no appreciable change\" is a direct contradiction of the consequences of mass-action kinetics when a reactant concentration is halved.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The reduction of Ku by $50\\%$ in $G_1$ preferentially diverts DSBs into homologous recombination, leading to faster RAD51 loading than DNA-PKcs recruitment due to unopposed MRN-CtIP resection.**\n- This statement fundamentally misunderstands the cell cycle control of DNA repair. The problem explicitly states that the cells are in $G_1$ and that HR is suppressed.\n- The claim of \"unopposed MRN-CtIP resection\" is false. Basis (iii) and (iv) state that resection is minimal in $G_1$ due to low CDK activity and inhibitory factors like 53BP1.\n- Consequently, diversion to HR and subsequent RAD51 loading will not occur.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2793476"}, {"introduction": "While NHEJ dominates G1, the S and G2 phases favor high-fidelity repair via homologous recombination.

The cell line is otherwise wild type for BRCA1, CtIP, the Shieldin complex, DNA polymerase theta (POLQ), and RAD52. An endonuclease-induced double-strand break is introduced within a chromosomal reporter array that can, depending on pathway choice, be resolved by one of the following: (i) RAD51-dependent homology-directed gene conversion via synthesis-dependent strand annealing or double Holliday junction routes (collectively referred to here as RAD51-dependent homologous recombination), (ii) single-strand annealing between direct repeats (RAD51-independent, RAD52-facilitated), or (iii) polymerase theta-mediated alternative end joining (alt-EJ, also called microhomology-mediated end joining), which uses microhomologies of approximately 2–20 base pairs with characteristic small deletions.

It specifies the cell cycle phase ($S/G_2$, where homologous recombination is active), defines the precise molecular defect (impaired RAD51 loading by BRCA2), states which processes are unaffected (resection), and explicitly lists the available alternative pathways and the one that is suppressed (c-NHEJ). The provided principles are consistent with established biological facts and guide the logical deduction. There are no contradictions.\n- **Objectivity and Clarity:** The terminology is precise and unambiguous (e.g., \"RAD51-dependent gene conversion\", \"single-strand annealing\"). The question is clearly formulated, asking for a prediction of relative changes based on the given premises.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived based on the provided principles.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe problem states that a mutation in a BRCA2 BRC repeat reduces its ability to load RAD51 onto resected ssDNA. According to the provided principles, RAD51 loading is a prerequisite for homologous recombination (HR). The primary function of BRCA2 is to displace RPA from the resected ssDNA and nucleate the formation of a RAD51 filament, which is essential for homology search and strand invasion.\n\n1.  **Impact on RAD51-dependent HR:** A reduction in RAD51 loading capability directly cripples the initiation of HR. Consequently, the frequency of repair events successfully completed via RAD51-dependent pathways, such as gene conversion (through SDSA or dHJ mechanisms), must decrease significantly.\n\n2.  **Fate of the Repair Substrate:** The problem explicitly states that DSB end resection is unaffected. This means that the cellular machinery still generates long 3' ssDNA tails coated with RPA. This resected ssDNA is the key intermediate for which multiple repair pathways compete.\n\n3.  **Pathway Competition:** In a wild-type cell in $S/G_2$, HR is the preferred pathway for repairing DSBs using this resected substrate. Since HR is now compromised in the mutant, the unrepaired ssDNA substrates become available for alternative, RAD51-independent pathways. The problem identifies two such competing pathways: single-strand annealing (SSA) and polymerase theta-mediated alternative end joining (alt-EJ). As the primary pathway (HR) is blocked, the flux of repair must be channeled into these alternative pathways. Therefore, we predict a compensatory increase in the frequency of both SSA and alt-EJ.\n\n4.  **Molecular Signatures:**\n    - **SSA:** This pathway operates by annealing between two direct homologous repeat sequences that flank the break. The intervening DNA, as well as the DNA between the break and the proximal repeat, is deleted. This typically results in large, characteristic deletions. An increase in SSA events will lead to an increase in the observation of such junctions.\n    - **alt-EJ:** This pathway, mediated by POLQ, utilizes very short microhomologies (2-20 base pairs) to align the ends before processing and ligation. This process is inherently mutagenic, often resulting in small deletions at the repair junction, with the microhomology preserved. An increase in alt-EJ will result in a higher frequency of junctions bearing these signatures.\n    - **c-NHEJ:** The problem states this pathway is disfavored due to enforced resection. This condition is unchanged by the BRCA2 mutation. Therefore, c-NHEJ will remain a minor pathway.\n\n**Conclusion:** The net effect of the specified BRCA2 mutation is a marked decrease in RAD51-dependent HR and a corresponding increase in repair by SSA and alt-EJ, the signatures of which (large deletions for SSA, microhomology use with small deletions for alt-EJ) will become more prevalent.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. A marked decrease in RAD51-dependent gene conversion, with compensatory increases in both single-strand annealing and alt-EJ; junctions exhibit longer deletions when single-strand annealing occurs and increased microhomology usage with small deletions at alt-EJ junctions; c-NHEJ remains low due to sustained resection.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with the derived conclusions. It correctly predicts the decrease in the primary pathway (HR), the compensatory increase in the two specified alternative pathways (SSA and alt-EJ), the correct molecular signatures for those pathways, and the continued suppression of c-NHEJ. This option is **Correct**.\n\n**B. An increase in RAD51-dependent gene conversion because BRCA1 compensates for defective BRCA2; single-strand annealing and alt-EJ both decrease as homology-directed repair becomes more efficient overall.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The mutation *reduces* the efficiency of RAD51 loading, hence HR will decrease, not increase. Furthermore, while BRCA1 is a critical partner protein, it does not functionally substitute for the specific RAD51-loading activity of BRCA2. This premise is biologically flawed. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. A predominant shift to classical nonhomologous end joining because homologous recombination is compromised; end resection is reduced, so alt-EJ is unchanged and single-strand annealing decreases.**\nThis statement contains multiple errors. First, it explicitly contradicts the given condition that c-NHEJ is disfavored. Second, it falsely claims end resection is reduced, which also contradicts a given condition. Because resection is intact, both SSA and alt-EJ are expected to increase, not remain unchanged or decrease. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. No appreciable change in the distribution because RAD52 substitutes for BRCA2 to load RAD51; single-strand annealing remains constant and alt-EJ slightly decreases due to improved RAD51 filament formation.**\nThis statement is incorrect. In mammalian cells, RAD52 is not an efficient substitute for the canonical BRCA2-mediated RAD51 loading required for HR. A defect in BRCA2 leads to a severe HR deficiency, not \"no appreciable change\". The notion of improved RAD51 filament formation directly contradicts the known effect of the mutation. The primary role of mammalian RAD52 relevant here is in facilitating SSA, not compensating for BRCA2 in HR. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. An increase in crossover-prone double Holliday junction resolution and break-induced replication as backup homologous recombination pathways, while single-strand annealing decreases and alt-EJ remains unchanged, because the mutant BRCA2 preferentially promotes long-range strand migration over synthesis-dependent strand annealing.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Double Holliday junction resolution and break-induced replication are both RAD51-dependent processes. They cannot increase when the initial, essential step of RAD51 loading is impaired. The problem lies upstream of the choice between different HR sub-pathways. The premise that the mutation confers a new, specific function is baseless and contradicts the provided information that it *reduces* a function. The prediction that SSA decreases and alt-EJ is unchanged is also incorrect.

Substituting this into the survival equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{N_0}{2} = N_0 \\exp(-k t_{1/2})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k t_{1/2})\n$$\nSolving for the rate constant $k$ gives the fundamental relationship:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k t_{1/2} \\implies -\\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2} \\implies k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}\n$$\nWe use this relationship to compute the rate constants for HR and NHEJ from their given isolated-pathway half-times.\nGiven $t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{HR}} = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{h}$:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{HR}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{HR}}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{5.0\\,\\mathrm{h}} \\approx 0.138629\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $k_{\\mathrm{HR}} \\approx 0.1386\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n\nGiven $t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{NHEJ}} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{h}$:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{NHEJ}}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.5\\,\\mathrm{h}} = 2\\ln(2)\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} \\approx 1.38629\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $k_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}} \\approx 1.386\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n\nNow, we consider the scenario where both pathways compete for the same pool of unrepaired breaks. Let $U(t)$ be the fraction of unrepaired breaks at time $t$, with $U(0)=1$. Since the pathways are independent, the total rate of repair is the sum of the individual rates. The rate of change of the unrepaired fraction is thus:\n$$\n\\frac{dU(t)}{dt} = -k_{\\mathrm{HR}}U(t) - k_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}}U(t) = -(k_{\\mathrm{HR}} + k_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}})U(t)\n$$\nLet $k_{\\mathrm{total}} = k_{\\mathrm{HR}} + k_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}}$. The differential equation becomes $\\frac{dU}{dt} = -k_{\\mathrm{total}}U$, which has the solution:\n$$\nU(t) = \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{total}}t) = \\exp(-(k_{\\mathrm{HR}} + k_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}})t)\n$$\nThe cumulative fraction of initial breaks repaired by a specific pathway up to time $T$, for example HR, is denoted $F_{\\mathrm{HR}}(T)$. This is the time integral of the flux into the HR-repaired state. The flux at time $t$ is the rate of repair by HR, which is $k_{\\mathrm{HR}}U(t)$.\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{HR}}(T) = \\int_{0}^{T} k_{\\mathrm{HR}}U(t)\\,dt = \\int_{0}^{T} k_{\\mathrm{HR}}\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{total}}t)\\,dt\n$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{HR}}(T) = k_{\\mathrm{HR}} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{total}}}\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{total}}t) \\right]_{0}^{T} = -\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{HR}}}{k_{\\mathrm{total}}} \\left( \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{total}}T) - \\exp(0) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{HR}}(T) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{HR}}}{k_{\\mathrm{total}}} \\left( 1 - \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{total}}T) \\right) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{HR}}}{k_{\\mathrm{HR}} + k_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}}} \\left( 1 - \\exp(-(k_{\\mathrm{HR}} + k_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}})T) \\right)\n$$\nBy analogy, the cumulative fraction repaired by NHEJ is:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}}(T) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}}}{k_{\\mathrm{HR}} + k_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}}} \\left( 1 - \\exp(-(k_{\\mathrm{HR}} + k_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}})T) \\right)\n$$\nWe now evaluate these expressions at $T = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{h}$ using the previously calculated rate constants. It is critical to use unrounded values for intermediate calculations.\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{HR}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{5.0} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad k_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.5}\n$$\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{total}} = k_{\\mathrm{HR}} + k_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}} = \\ln(2)\\left(\\frac{1}{5.0} + \\frac{1}{0.5}\\right) = \\ln(2)(0.2 + 2.0) = 2.2\\ln(2)\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}\n$$\nThe term $k_{\\mathrm{total}}T$ is:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{total}}T = (2.2\\ln(2)) \\times 2.0 = 4.4\\ln(2) \\approx 3.04985\n$$\nThe fraction of total breaks repaired by time $T$ is:\n$$\n1 - \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{total}}T) = 1 - \\exp(-4.4\\ln(2)) = 1 - (\\exp(\\ln(2)))^{-4.4} = 1 - 2^{-4.4} \\approx 1 - 0.047367 = 0.952633\n$$\nThe probability that a given repair event is HR is the ratio of its rate constant to the total rate constant:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{HR}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{HR}}}{k_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)/5.0}{2.2\\ln(2)} = \\frac{1/5.0}{2.2} = \\frac{0.2}{2.2} = \\frac{1}{11}\n$$\nSimilarly, for NHEJ:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}}}{k_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)/0.5}{2.2\\ln(2)} = \\frac{1/0.5}{2.2} = \\frac{2.0}{2.2} = \\frac{10}{11}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the cumulative fractions:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{HR}}(T) = P_{\\mathrm{HR}} \\times (1 - \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{total}}T)) = \\frac{1}{11} \\left(1 - 2^{-4.4}\\right) \\approx \\frac{1}{11} \\times 0.952633 \\approx 0.086603\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $F_{\\mathrm{HR}}(2.0\\,\\mathrm{h}) \\approx 0.08660$.\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}}(T) = P_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}} \\times (1 - \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{total}}T)) = \\frac{10}{11} \\left(1 - 2^{-4.4}\\right) \\approx \\frac{10}{11} \\times 0.952633 \\approx 0.86603\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $F_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}}(2.0\\,\\mathrm{h}) \\approx 0.8660$.\n\nThe required quantities are:\n$k_{\\mathrm{HR}} \\approx 0.1386\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}} \\approx 1.386\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n$F_{\\mathrm{HR}}(2.0\\,\\mathrm{h}) \\approx 0.08660$\n$F_{\\mathrm{NHEJ}}(2.0\\,\\mathrm{h}) \\approx 0.8660$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.1386  1.386  0.08660  0.8660\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2793495"}]}
