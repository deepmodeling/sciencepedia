A solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to find an expression for the fractional reduction in transduction success, $R$, defined as:\n$$\nR = 1 - \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{with}}}{P_{\\mathrm{no}}}\n$$\nThe term $P_{\\mathrm{no}}$ represents the probability of successful transduction (encompassing all necessary steps like adsorption, injection, and recombination) under the condition that the incoming DNA is not subject to restriction. The term $P_{\\mathrm{with}}$ represents the probability of successful transduction when the restriction system is active.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the only difference between these two scenarios is the potential for the donor DNA fragment to be cleaved by the recipient's restriction endonuclease. Therefore, the probability of success in the presence of restriction, $P_{\\mathrm{with}}$, can be expressed as the product of two probabilities: the probability that the donor DNA fragment survives restriction (i.e., remains intact), and the probability of successful transduction given that the fragment has survived.\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{with}} = P(\\text{success} | \\text{fragment survives}) \\times P(\\text{fragment survives})\n$$\nThe problem states that if restriction is the only differing factor, then the probability of successful transduction, given the fragment is intact, is simply $P_{\\mathrm{no}}$. Thus, we have:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{with}} = P_{\\mathrm{no}} \\times P(\\text{fragment survives})\n$$\nNow, we must determine the probability that the DNA fragment survives. The fragment contains $s$ recognition sites for the restriction enzyme. The probability of cleavage at any single site is given as $c$. It follows that the probability of a single site *not* being cleaved is $1 - c$.\n\nThe problem specifies that cleavage events at each site are independent. For the entire fragment to survive intact, it is necessary that *all* $s$ sites escape cleavage. The probability of this compound event is the product of the individual probabilities for each site.\n$$\nP(\\text{fragment survives}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{s} P(\\text{site } i \\text{ is not cleaved})\n$$\nSince the probability of any site not being cleaved is $1 - c$, this expression becomes:\n$$\nP(\\text{fragment survives}) = (1 - c)^{s}\n$$\nThis also correctly handles the case where $s=0$.

These totals are given by the spatio-temporal integrals of their respective event rate densities:\nTransformation: $T_{\\mathrm{tr}} = \\int_0^T \\int_0^L r_{\\mathrm{tr}}(x,t)\\,dx\\,dt$, where $r_{\\mathrm{tr}}(x,t) = k_u p_c R E(x,t)$.\nTransduction: $T_{\\mathrm{td}} = \\int_0^T \\int_0^L r_{\\mathrm{td}}(x,t)\\,dx\\,dt$, where $r_{\\mathrm{td}}(x,t) = \\eta \\phi P(x,t) R$.\nConjugation: $T_{\\mathrm{cj}} = \\int_0^T \\int_0^L r_{\\mathrm{cj}}(x,t)\\,dx\\,dt$, where $r_{\\mathrm{cj}}(x,t) = k_c D R$.\n\nThe integrals for $T_{\\mathrm{tr}}$ and $T_{\\mathrm{td}}$ are computed numerically alongside the simulation by summing the contributions at each time step:\n$$\nT_{\\text{type}} \\approx \\sum_{j=0}^{M-1} \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} r_{\\text{type}}(x_i, t_j) \\Delta x \\right) \\Delta t\n$$\nwhere $M=T/\\Delta t$ is the total number of time steps.\nThe conjugation rate density $r_{\\mathrm{cj}}$ is constant in both space and time, so its integral can be solved analytically:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{cj}} = k_c D R L T\n$$\nFinally, for each parameter set, we compare the computed values of $T_{\\mathrm{tr}}$, $T_{\\mathrm{td}}$, and $T_{\\mathrm{cj}}$. The dominant mechanism is the one with the largest total. The result is reported as an index: $0$ for transformation, $1$ for transduction, and $2$ for conjugation. Ties are broken by selecting the mechanism with the lower index.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef run_simulation(params):\n    \"\"\"\n    Runs a single reaction-diffusion simulation for the given parameters.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Unpack parameters\n    R, D, E0, P0 = params['R'], params['D'], params['E0'], params['P0']\n    DE, DP = params['DE'], params['DP']\n    ku, pc, delta_E, rho = params['ku'], params['pc'], params['delta_E'], params['rho']\n    phi, B, delta_P, eta = params['phi'], params['B'], params['delta_P'], params['eta']\n    kc, T = params['kc'], params['T']\n\n    # Fixed simulation domain parameters\n    L = 100.0  # micrometers\n    N = 50     # number of grid points\n\n    # Discretization parameters\n    dx = L / (N - 1)\n    # Stability condition for explicit forward-Euler\n    max_D = max(DE, DP)\n    if max_D == 0:\n        # If no diffusion, any dt is stable w.r.t. diffusion, choose a reasonable one.\n        dt = 0.1\n    else:\n        dt_max = dx**2 / (2 * max_D)\n        dt = 0.9 * dt_max # Use a 90% safety factor\n\n    num_steps = int(T / dt)\n\n    # Initialize state variables (concentration arrays)\n    E = np.full(N, E0, dtype=float)\n    P = np.full(N, P0, dtype=float)\n\n    # Initialize cumulative event counters\n    total_tr_events = 0.0\n    total_td_events = 0.0\n\n    # Main simulation loop (Forward-Time, Centered-Space)\n    for _ in range(num_steps):\n        # --- Calculate Laplacians for diffusion term ---\n        # For E\n        d2E_dx2 = np.zeros(N)\n        d2E_dx2[1:-1] = (E[:-2] - 2 * E[1:-1] + E[2:]) / dx**2\n        # No-flux boundary conditions\n        d2E_dx2[0] = 2 * (E[1] - E[0]) / dx**2\n        d2E_dx2[-1] = 2 * (E[-2] - E[-1]) / dx**2\n        \n        # For P\n        d2P_dx2 = np.zeros(N)\n        d2P_dx2[1:-1] = (P[:-2] - 2 * P[1:-1] + P[2:]) / dx**2\n        # No-flux boundary conditions\n        d2P_dx2[0] = 2 * (P[1] - P[0]) / dx**2\n        d2P_dx2[-1] = 2 * (P[-2] - P[-1]) / dx**2\n\n        # --- Calculate reaction terms ---\n        reaction_E = -(ku * pc * R + delta_E) * E + (rho * phi * (R + D)) * P\n        reaction_P = ((B - 1) * phi * (R + D) - delta_P) * P\n        \n        # --- Update state variables using forward-Euler ---\n        dE_dt = DE * d2E_dx2 + reaction_E\n        dP_dt = DP * d2P_dx2 + reaction_P\n        \n        E_new = E + dE_dt * dt\n        P_new = P + dP_dt * dt\n        \n        # Enforce non-negativity\n        E = np.maximum(0, E_new)\n        P = np.maximum(0, P_new)\n\n        # --- Update event counters ---\n        # Integrate rates over space (sum * dx) and time (multiply by dt)\n        rate_tr = ku * pc * R * E\n        rate_td = eta * phi * R * P\n        \n        total_tr_events += np.sum(rate_tr) * dx * dt\n        total_td_events += np.sum(rate_td) * dx * dt\n\n    # Calculate total conjugation events (analytical solution)\n    total_cj_events = kc * D * R * L * T\n\n    # Determine dominant mechanism\n    totals = [total_tr_events, total_td_events, total_cj_events]\n    return np.argmax(totals)\n\ndef solve():\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A\n        {'R': 1.0, 'D': 0.2, 'E0': 8.0, 'P0': 0.02, 'DE': 3.0, 'DP': 1.0,\n         'ku': 0.03, 'pc': 0.6, 'delta_E': 0.01, 'rho': 0.1,\n         'phi': 0.002, 'B': 2.0, 'delta_P': 0.6, 'eta': 0.1,\n         'kc': 0.0002, 'T': 40.0},\n        # Case B\n        {'R': 1.0, 'D': 0.1, 'E0': 0.05, 'P0': 0.2, 'DE': 1.0, 'DP': 2.5,\n         'ku': 0.01, 'pc': 0.1, 'delta_E': 0.02, 'rho': 0.05,\n         'phi': 0.04, 'B': 4.0, 'delta_P': 0.1, 'eta': 0.3,\n         'kc': 0.0001, 'T': 40.0},\n        # Case C\n        {'R': 1.0, 'D': 1.0, 'E0': 0.2, 'P0': 0.01, 'DE': 2.0, 'DP': 1.0,\n         'ku': 0.005, 'pc': 0.05, 'delta_E': 0.02, 'rho': 0.05,\n         'phi': 0.002, 'B': 2.0, 'delta_P': 0.3, 'eta': 0.05,\n         'kc': 0.02, 'T': 40.0},\n        # Case D\n        {'R': 1.0, 'D': 0.0, 'E0': 0.5, 'P0': 0.0, 'DE': 2.0, 'DP': 1.0,\n         'ku': 0.02, 'pc': 0.5, 'delta_E': 0.02, 'rho': 0.1,\n         'phi': 0.01, 'B': 2.0, 'delta_P': 0.1, 'eta': 0.2,\n         'kc': 0.01, 'T': 40.0},\n        # Case E\n        {'R': 1.0, 'D': 0.0, 'E0': 0.0, 'P0': 0.1, 'DE': 1.0, 'DP': 2.0,\n         'ku': 0.01, 'pc': 0.1, 'delta_E': 0.02, 'rho': 0.05,\n         'phi': 0.05, 'B': 5.0, 'delta_P': 0.1, 'eta': 0.5,\n         'kc': 0.005, 'T': 40.0},\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case_params in test_cases:\n        result = run_simulation(case_params)\n        results.append(result)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2805689"}]}
