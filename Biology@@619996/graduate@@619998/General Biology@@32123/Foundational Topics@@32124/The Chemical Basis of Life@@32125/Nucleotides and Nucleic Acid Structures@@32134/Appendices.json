The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and a clear definition to arrive at a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe topology of a covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) molecule is described by the fundamental equation:\n$$\nLk = Tw + Wr\n$$\nwhere $Lk$ is the linking number, $Tw$ is the twist, and $Wr$ is the writhe. The linking number is an integer constant for a given cccDNA molecule as long as no phosphodiester bonds are broken. $Tw$ represents the number of times one strand winds around the other (helical winding), and $Wr$ represents the number of times the duplex axis crosses over itself (supercoiling).\n\nTo quantify the degree of supercoiling, we must compare the actual linking number ($Lk$) of the plasmid to the linking number it would have in a fully relaxed state, denoted as $Lk_0$. For a relaxed plasmid, the duplex axis is not contorted, meaning its writhe is zero ($Wr = 0$). In this state, the linking number is equal to the twist, $Lk_0 = Tw_0$. The twist of a relaxed DNA molecule is determined by its total length in base pairs ($N$) and the intrinsic helical repeat ($h$).\n$$\nLk_0 = \\frac{N}{h}\n$$\nUsing the provided values:\n$$\nLk_0 = \\frac{4361}{10.45} \\approx 417.32057\n$$\nThe value of $Lk_0$ is generally not an integer, as it represents a property of the relaxed DNA state in solution, not a specific topoisomer.\n\nThe problem defines the superhelical density, $\\sigma$, as the fractional difference in linking number relative to the relaxed state. This can be expressed mathematically as the change in linking number ($\\Delta Lk$) normalized by the linking number of the relaxed state ($Lk_0$).\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{\\Delta Lk}{Lk_0} = \\frac{Lk - Lk_0}{Lk_0}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given value for $Lk$ and the calculated value for $Lk_0$ into this equation.\n$$\nLk = 405\n$$\n$$\nLk_0 \\approx 417.32057\n$$\nThe calculation for $\\sigma$ is as follows:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{405 - 417.32057}{417.32057} = \\frac{-12.32057}{417.32057} \\approx -0.029518...\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\sigma \\approx -0.02952\n$$\nThe sign of the superhelical density provides critical information about the DNA's conformational state.\nA negative sign ($\\sigma < 0$) indicates that the plasmid is **negatively supercoiled**. This means that its linking number ($Lk = 405$) is less than the linking number of the corresponding relaxed molecule ($Lk_0 \\approx 417.3$). This deficit in linking number ($\\Delta Lk < 0$) signifies that the DNA is **underwound** relative to the relaxed B-form helix. The strain from this underwinding is partitioned between a reduction in twist ($Tw < Tw_0$) and the adoption of negative writhe ($Wr < 0$), causing the plasmid to contort in space. Most naturally occurring plasmids in bacteria are negatively supercoiled, as this state facilitates processes such as DNA replication and transcription, which require strand separation.\n\nConversely, a positive sign ($\\sigma > 0$) would indicate positive supercoiling, where the DNA is overwound ($Lk > Lk_0$).\n\nBased on the calculated negative value of $\\sigma$, the plasmid is negatively supercoiled and is underwound relative to its relaxed state.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.02952}$$", "id": "2820020"}, {"introduction": "The stability of nucleic acid structures is governed by thermodynamic principles, where the free energy of duplex formation depends critically on the sequence of base pairs.
