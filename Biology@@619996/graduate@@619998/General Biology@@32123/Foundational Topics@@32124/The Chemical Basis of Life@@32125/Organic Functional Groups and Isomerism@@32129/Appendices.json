Do not include units in the final answer.", "solution": "The problem requires a three-part analysis concerning the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for a given molecular formula, starting from first principles.\n\nFirst, we must derive a general expression for the IHD for a molecule with the formula $\\text{C}_C \\text{H}_H \\text{N}_N \\text{O}_O \\text{X}_X$, where $C$, $H$, $N$, $O$, and $X$ represent the counts of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and halogen atoms, respectively. The derivation must be based solely on the provided foundational facts.\n\nLet us define the IHD as the number of pairs of hydrogen atoms that must be removed from a corresponding saturated, acyclic structure to obtain the actual molecular formula. Each such pair corresponds to one unit of unsaturation (a ring or a $\\pi$-bond).\n\n1.  We begin by establishing the formula for a saturated, acyclic reference molecule containing $C$ carbon atoms, $N$ nitrogen atoms, and $O$ oxygen atoms. According to fact (i), a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon with $C$ carbons possesses $2C+2$ hydrogen atoms. Fact (v) states that each trivalent nitrogen atom increases the hydrogen requirement by $1$. Therefore, for $N$ nitrogen atoms, the hydrogen count for saturation increases by $N$. Fact (iv) states that divalent oxygen does not alter the hydrogen requirement. Thus, the total number of hydrogen atoms required for a saturated, acyclic molecule containing $C$ carbons and $N$ nitrogens is $H_{\\text{saturated}} = 2C + 2 + N$.\n\n2.  Next, we account for the monovalent atoms actually present in the molecule. According to fact (vi), a halogen atom ($X$) is equivalent to a hydrogen atom. Therefore, the total count of monovalent atoms, or \"hydrogen-equivalents\", present in the molecule is $H_{\\text{actual}} = H + X$.\n\n3.  The hydrogen deficiency is the difference between the number of hydrogen atoms required for saturation and the number of hydrogen-equivalents actually present:\n    $$ \\text{Deficiency} = H_{\\text{saturated}} - H_{\\text{actual}} = (2C + 2 + N) - (H + X) $$\n    Facts (ii) and (iii) establish that a double bond or a ring corresponds to a loss of $2$ hydrogen atoms (one unit of unsaturation), while a triple bond corresponds to a loss of $4$ hydrogen atoms (two units of unsaturation). The IHD is therefore the total deficiency divided by $2$:\n    $$ IHD = \\frac{\\text{Deficiency}}{2} = \\frac{(2C + 2 + N) - (H + X)}{2} $$\n    This is the general expression for the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency derived from the given principles.\n\nSecond, we apply this derived expression to compute the IHD for the molecular formula $\\text{C}_9\\text{H}_{10}\\text{O}$.\nFor this formula, the elemental counts are $C=9$, $H=10$, $O=1$, $N=0$, and $X=0$. Substituting these values into our expression:\n$$ IHD = \\frac{(2 \\times 9 + 2 + 0) - (10 + 0)}{2} $$\n$$ IHD = \\frac{(18 + 2) - 10}{2} $$\n$$ IHD = \\frac{20 - 10}{2} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5 $$\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for $\\text{C}_9\\text{H}_{10}\\text{O}$ is $5$.\n\nThird, we must find the total number of distinct non-negative integer triples $(r, d, t)$ that satisfy the equation $IHD = r + d + 2t$, where $r$, $d$, and $t$ are the counts of rings, double bonds, and triple bonds, respectively. Using the calculated $IHD=5$, we have the linear Diophantine equation:\n$$ r + d + 2t = 5 $$\nwhere $r, d, t$ are non-negative integers ($r \\ge 0$, $d \\ge 0$, $t \\ge 0$). We can find all solutions by systematically considering the possible values for $t$, as its coefficient is the largest. The maximum possible value for $t$ is $\\lfloor \\frac{5}{2} \\rfloor = 2$.\n\nCase 1: $t = 0$.\nThe equation simplifies to $r + d = 5$. The non-negative integer solutions $(r, d)$ are:\n$(0, 5)$, $(1, 4)$, $(2, 3)$, $(3, 2)$, $(4, 1)$, $(5, 0)$.\nThere are $6$ solutions in this case.\n\nCase 2: $t = 1$.\nThe equation becomes $r + d + 2(1) = 5$, which simplifies to $r + d = 3$. The non-negative integer solutions $(r, d)$ are:\n$(0, 3)$, $(1, 2)$, $(2, 1)$, $(3, 0)$.\nThere are $4$ solutions in this case.\n\nCase 3: $t = 2$.\nThe equation becomes $r + d + 2(2) = 5$, which simplifies to $r + d = 1$. The non-negative integer solutions $(r, d)$ are:\n$(0, 1)$, $(1, 0)$.\nThere are $2$ solutions in this case.\n\nIf $t \\ge 3$, then $2t \\ge 6$, which would require $r+d$ to be negative. This is impossible for non-negative integers $r$ and $d$.\nThe total number of distinct triples $(r, d, t)$ is the sum of the solutions from all possible cases:\nTotal number of solutions = $6 + 4 + 2 = 12$.\n\nThe two quantities required for the final answer are the IHD for $\\text{C}_9\\text{H}_{10}\\text{O}$, which is $5$, and the total number of distinct triples, which is $12$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 5 & 12 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2820775"}, {"introduction": "The three-dimensional arrangement of atoms, or stereochemistry, is paramount in biology, where molecular shape dictates function.

All principles listed are fundamental tenets of stereochemistry. The molecule, tartaric acid, is the canonical example used to teach the concepts of enantiomers, diastereomers, and meso compounds. The question is well-posed, asking for a definition and an explanation that can be logically derived from the provided axioms. The language is objective and precise. The problem contains no scientific fallacies, contradictions, or ambiguities. It is a valid, well-formulated problem in organic chemistry.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation and Analysis of Options**\n\nThe analysis must begin with the structure of $2,3$-dihydroxybutanedioic acid, $HOOC-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-COOH$. This molecule possesses two stereogenic centers, at carbon atom $2$ (C-$2$) and carbon atom $3$ (C-$3$). According to the problem statement, we must consider the $(R,S)$ stereoisomer.\n\nA key feature of tartaric acid is that the substituents on C-$2$ are identical to the substituents on C-$3$: a hydrogen atom ($H$), a hydroxyl group ($-OH$), a carboxyl group ($-COOH$), and the other carbon of the stereocenter pair. This symmetry in substitution pattern is crucial.\n\nLet us examine the $(R,S)$ isomer, also denoted $(2R,3S)$-tartaric acid. Due to the identical substitution at C-$2$ and C-$3$, it is possible to orient the molecule such that it possesses an internal plane of symmetry (a mirror plane, $\\sigma$). This plane bisects the C-$2$—C-$3$ bond and relates the top half of the molecule to the bottom half as a mirror image.\n\n- According to **Principle (ii)**, any structure possessing a mirror plane is achiral. Since the $(R,S)$-tartaric acid molecule possesses such a plane, it is achiral.\n- According to **Principle (i)**, an achiral molecule is superposable on its mirror image. The $(R,S)$ isomer is indeed superposable on its mirror image. In fact, if we assign configurations, we find that $(2R,3S)$ and $(2S,3R)$ are the same molecule, not enantiomers.\n\nA molecule that contains stereogenic centers but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry is defined as a **meso compound**. Thus, $(R,S)$-tartaric acid is a meso compound.\n\nOptical activity is a direct consequence of molecular chirality. Since a meso compound is achiral, it cannot rotate the plane of polarized light. Therefore, its specific rotation, $[\\alpha]_{\\lambda}^{T}$, must be zero. The explanation for this phenomenon can be conceptualized as an internal cancellation. The stereogenic center with the $(R)$ configuration would contribute a certain rotation, while the stereogenic center with the $(S)$ configuration, being part of a molecular fragment that is the mirror image of the first, must contribute a rotation of equal magnitude and opposite sign, as per the logic of **Principle (iii)** applied internally. The net result is a specific rotation of zero, $[\\alpha]_{\\lambda}^{T} = 0$. This is an intrinsic property of the pure compound, consistent with **Principle (iv)**.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option based on this derivation.\n\n**A. A meso compound is a single stereoisomer that contains stereogenic centers but is achiral because the whole molecule possesses an internal symmetry element (for example, a mirror plane or an improper axis $S_n$), rendering it superposable on its mirror image; meso-tartaric acid is $(R,S)$ and has an internal mirror plane that relates the two halves, so any optical rotation produced by one half is exactly canceled by the symmetry-related half, yielding $[\\alpha]_{\\lambda}^{T}=0$ for the pure compound.**\nThis option provides a textbook-correct definition of a meso compound. It correctly identifies that a meso compound is a single, pure molecule, not a mixture. It correctly attributes its achirality, despite the presence of stereocenters, to an element of symmetry, as stated in Principle (ii). The explanation for the optical inactivity of $(R,S)$-tartaric acid is also fundamentally correct: the internal mirror plane leads to an internal cancellation of optical rotation effects between the two halves of the molecule. This entire statement is consistent with the provided principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. A meso compound is any molecule with at least two stereogenic centers; meso-tartaric acid is optically inactive because it rapidly racemizes in aqueous solution, constantly interconverting between $(R,S)$, $(R,R)$, and $(S,S)$, which drives the time-averaged specific rotation $[\\alpha]_{\\lambda}^{T}$ to zero.**\nThe definition is false. For example, $(R,R)$-tartaric acid has two stereogenic centers and is chiral. The explanation is also false. A meso compound is optically inactive because it is achiral as a pure substance (Principle iv), not because of racemization or interconversion with its diastereomers. Interconversion between diastereomers would require breaking covalent bonds and is not a spontaneous, rapid process under normal conditions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. A meso compound is a $1{:}1$ mixture of two enantiomers; meso-tartaric acid is optically inactive because it is a racemic mixture of $(R,R)$ and $(S,S)$, whose equal and opposite specific rotations cancel so that $[\\alpha]_{\\lambda}^{T}=0$.**\nThe definition is incorrect. It describes a racemic mixture (a racemate), not a meso compound. A meso compound is a single molecular species. The explanation is consequently flawed; meso-tartaric acid is the $(R,S)$ isomer, not a mixture of the $(R,R)$ and $(S,S)$ isomers. While a racemate is also optically inactive, the reasoning is misapplied to a meso compound.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. A meso compound is any molecule that contains an equal number of $R$ and $S$ stereocenters; meso-tartaric acid is optically inactive because having one $R$ and one $S$ center guarantees that $[\\alpha]_{\\lambda}^{T}=0$ irrespective of the overall symmetry of the molecular framework.**\nThe definition is an incorrect generalization. While $(R,S)$-tartaric acid is meso, having an equal number of $R$ and $S$ centers does not guarantee a molecule is meso. The overall symmetry is the determining factor. The explanation contains a severe error by stating the effect is \"irrespective of the overall symmetry\". On the contrary, the achirality is a direct consequence of the overall molecular symmetry, as stated in Principle (ii). Without the specific symmetry of tartaric acid, a molecule with one $R$ and one $S$ center (e.g., $(2R,3S)$-2-bromo-3-chlorobutane) would be chiral.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. A meso compound is defined by lack of extended $\\pi$-conjugation across the stereocenters; meso-tartaric acid is optically inactive because optical rotation requires a conjugated chromophore, and its absence forces $[\\alpha]_{\\lambda}^{T}=0$ even if the molecule is chiral.**\nThis statement is nonsensical. The definition of a meso compound has no relation to $\\pi$-conjugation. The explanation is also scientifically false. Optical activity is a property of chiral molecules in general, not only those with a chromophore. Molecules without $\\pi$-systems, like chiral alkanes, can exhibit optical rotation. The presence of a chromophore can enhance the magnitude of rotation but is not a prerequisite for its existence.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nConclusion: Only option A accurately defines a meso compound and correctly explains the optical inactivity of $(R,S)$-tartaric acid based on the fundamental principles of stereochemistry.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2820740"}, {"introduction": "A functional group is more than just an arrangement of atoms; it is a center of reactivity.
