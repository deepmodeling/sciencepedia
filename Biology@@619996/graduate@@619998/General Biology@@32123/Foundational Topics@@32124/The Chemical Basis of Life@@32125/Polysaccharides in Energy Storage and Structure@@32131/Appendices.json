A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe osmotic pressure, $\\Pi$, is given by the van't Hoff equation for a dilute solution:\n$$\n\\Pi = iCRT\n$$\nwhere $i$ is the van't Hoff factor, $C$ is the molar concentration of solute particles, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.

The quantity $C_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ represents the concentration of glucose monomer units, while $C_{\\mathrm{poly}}$ represents the concentration of the polymer chains themselves. The number-average degree of polymerization, $DP_n$, is defined as the total number of glucose residues divided by the total number of polymer molecules.

Consider a single, finite, connected glucan molecule that is acyclic (no internal glycosidic cycles), with $b$ branch points formed by $\\alpha(1 \\to 6)$ linkages in addition to $\\alpha(1 \\to 4)$ linkages. Each glycosidic bond is formed by the anomeric carbon of the donor glucose reacting with a hydroxyl group of the acceptor glucose. The reducing end of the glucan is defined as a terminal glucose residue whose anomeric carbon is not involved in any glycosidic bond and is therefore capable of interconverting between cyclic and open-chain forms.

It describes a branched homopolymer, which can be abstractly and correctly represented as a mathematical graph. The definitions provided for the chemical entities are standard in biochemistry. The constraint to use \"conservation-of-connectivity reasoning grounded in standard graph-theoretic properties\" is a valid and rigorous approach. The problem asks for a function $R(n, b)$, which may include the possibility of a constant function, and thus is not inherently contradictory. The problem contains no logical flaws, factual errors, or ambiguities that would prevent a unique, rigorous solution.\n\nStep 3: Verdict\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nDerivation of the Expression for $R$\n\nThe problem requires a graph-theoretic approach. We model the glucan molecule as a graph, $G$, where the vertices represent the $n$ glucose residues and the edges represent the glycosidic bonds linking them.\n\n1.  **Graph Properties**: The problem states the glucan is a \"single, finite, connected ... acyclic\" molecule. In graph theory, a connected graph with no cycles is defined as a tree. Therefore, the glucan molecule is topologically equivalent to a tree with $n$ vertices.\n\n2.  **Number of Edges in a Tree**: A fundamental theorem of graph theory states that any tree with $V$ vertices has exactly $E = V-1$ edges. For our glucan graph, the number of vertices is $V=n$. Thus, the number of edges, which corresponds to the number of glycosidic bonds, is precisely $n-1$.\n\n3.  **Anomeric Carbons and Glycosidic Bonds**: The definition of a glycosidic bond is crucial: \"Each glycosidic bond is formed by the anomeric carbon of the donor glucose...\". This means that for every one of the $n-1$ glycosidic bonds present in the molecule, exactly one anomeric carbon from one glucose residue is consumed.\n\n4.  **Conservation of Anomeric Carbons**: The entire polymer is composed of $n$ glucose residues. Each residue, by its intrinsic chemical nature, possesses exactly one anomeric carbon (the $C_1$ carbon). Therefore, the entire molecule contains a total of $n$ anomeric carbons.\n\n5.  **Calculating Free Anomeric Carbons**: We have a total of $n$ anomeric carbons and $n-1$ of them are utilized in forming the $n-1$ glycosidic bonds. The number of anomeric carbons that are *not* involved in any glycosidic bond is the difference between the total number and the number consumed:\n    $$ \\text{Number of free anomeric carbons} = (\\text{Total anomeric carbons}) - (\\text{Anomeric carbons in bonds}) $$\n    $$ \\text{Number of free anomeric carbons} = n - (n-1) = 1 $$\n\n6.  **Identifying the Reducing End**: The problem defines a reducing end as \"a terminal glucose residue whose anomeric carbon is not involved in any glycosidic bond\". Our calculation shows that in any single, connected, acyclic glucan, there is always exactly one such anomeric carbon. Consequently, there can be only one reducing end.\n\n7.  **Conclusion for R**: The number of reducing ends, $R$, is therefore constant and equal to $1$.\n    $$ R(n, b) = 1 $$\n    This result is a direct consequence of the defined acyclic and connected topology. It is independent of the number of residues, $n$, and the number of branch points, $b$. These parameters determine the total mass and the number of *non-reducing* ends, respectively, but the number of reducing ends is fixed at one per molecule.\n\nQualitative Analysis of Chemical Assay Signal\n\nThe second part of the question asks how the value of $R$ at fixed $n$ but varying $b$ would influence the signal of a reducing sugar assay.\n\nThe premise of this question contains a subtle flaw, which a rigorous analysis must expose. Based on the derivation above, the value of $R$ is constant; it is always $1$ for any single, intact glucan molecule. It does not vary with $b$.\n\nTherefore, the direct answer is that varying $b$ at a fixed $n$ has **no influence** on the value of $R$. Since the signal from a chemical assay for reducing sugars (such as the DNS assay or Benedict's test) is directly proportional to the number of available reducing ends, the signal generated by a single, intact glucan molecule is constant, regardless of its degree of branching. For any given molecule of glucan, the assay will detect its one and only one reducing end.\n\nIf we consider a bulk sample containing a fixed number of moles of intact glucan polymer, the total signal would be proportional to the number of molecules, as each contributes one reducing end. If $n$ is fixed, the molar mass is fixed, so a fixed total mass of polymer would also correspond to a fixed number of molecules. In such a scenario, varying the branching $b$ (while keeping $n$ fixed) does not change the number of molecules and thus does not change the total number of reducing ends in the sample. The signal would remain unchanged. The degree of branching $b$ influences the number of non-reducing ends, given by the relation $N_\\text{nre} = b + 1$, which affects the rate at which enzymes can add or remove glucose units, but it does not alter the reducing capacity of the intact polymer itself.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1} $$", "id": "2826459"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate function of a biopolymer is dictated by its precise three-dimensional conformation, which arises from a complex network of subtle non-covalent interactions.

Shorter polyiodide segments absorb at higher energy, corresponding to a shorter wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\max}$).\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The structures of amylose and its deoxy-analogue are well-defined. The formation of the amylose-iodine complex and its characteristic blue color (due to a charge-transfer band) are classic biochemical phenomena. The stabilization of polysaccharide helices by hydrogen bonds and stereoelectronic effects is a core concept in glycobiology. The relationship between the length of a conjugated system (here, the polyiodide chain) and its absorption wavelength is a fundamental principle of spectroscopy. The problem is well-posed, asking for a qualitative prediction based on a specific, controlled structural modification. All terms are defined, and the provided facts constitute a sufficient basis for deduction. The problem is objective and free of any flaws listed in the validation checklist.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of how the removal of the hydroxyl group at the $\\text{C}_{2}$ position of each glucose monomer affects the structure of the polysaccharide helix and, consequently, its ability to bind iodine.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Perturbation:** The only difference between amylose and the synthesized deoxy-amylose is the replacement of a hydroxyl group ($\\!-\\!\\text{OH}$) at the $\\text{C}_{2}$ position with a hydrogen atom ($\\!-\\!\\text{H}$). This is a significant chemical change.\n\n2.  **Impact on Helix Stability:** Foundational Fact (ii) explicitly states that the amylose helix is stabilized by an intrachain hydrogen-bonding network. A key example given is the $\\text{O}_{2}\\!-\\!\\text{H}\\cdots \\text{O}_{6}$ hydrogen bond, where the hydroxyl group at $\\text{C}_{2}$ of residue $i$ acts as a donor to the ring oxygen of the exocyclic hydroxymethyl group ($\\text{O}_{6}$) of residue $i-1$. By removing the $\\text{O}_{2}\\!-\\!\\text{H}$ group, we eliminate this crucial stabilizing interaction from every monomer junction. The loss of this extensive network of hydrogen bonds will destabilize the helical conformation. The polymer chain will become more flexible and conformationally disordered. The propensity to form and maintain a rigid, uniform helical structure is therefore significantly reduced.\n\n3.  **Impact on Iodine Binding Affinity ($\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$):** The formation of the host-guest complex between the polysaccharide helix and the polyiodide chain is a thermodynamically favorable process for amylose, characterized by a negative $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$. The stability of this complex relies on the pre-organization of the host (the polysaccharide) into a suitable cavity. Since the deoxy-amylose helix is less stable and less well-defined, it is a poorer host for the polyiodide guest. The binding process will be less favorable because energy must be expended to organize the more flexible deoxy-amylose chain into a helical conformation, and the resulting complex is less stabilized. A less favorable binding event corresponds to a less negative value of $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$. Therefore, $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$ for deoxy-amylose will be greater (less negative) than that for amylose.\n\n4.  **Impact on Absorption Maximum ($\\lambda_{\\max}$):** Foundational Fact (iii) establishes the link between the structure of the bound polyiodide chain and the observed $\\lambda_{\\max}$. A long, continuous, and electronically unperturbed polyiodide chain, such as $\\text{I}_{5}^{-}$ or longer, can only be accommodated within a long, uniform helical cavity. Such long chains have lower-energy electronic transitions, resulting in absorption at a long wavelength. The destabilized, more disordered helix of deoxy-amylose will be unable to template such long, continuous polyiodide segments. Instead, the polyiodide chain will be frequently interrupted or distorted, effectively breaking it into shorter segments. According to Fact (iii), shorter polyiodide segments absorb light at higher energy. Higher energy corresponds to a shorter wavelength. Therefore, the $\\lambda_{\\max}$ for the deoxy-amylose-iodine complex will be shifted to a shorter wavelength (a hypsochromic or \"blue\" shift) compared to the amylose-iodine complex.\n\n5.  **Role of Stereoelectronic Effects:** The problem also mentions stereoelectronic effects. The hydroxyl group at $\\text{C}_{2}$ is a polar, electron-withdrawing substituent. Its presence influences the electron distribution within the pyranose ring and around the glycosidic linkage. This, in turn, influences the conformational preferences for the glycosidic torsion angles ($\\phi$ and $\\psi$), including the exo-anomeric effect at the $\\alpha(1\\rightarrow 4)$ linkage. Removing this group alters the electronic landscape, which can weaken the energetic preference for the specific set of torsion angles that define the canonical amylose helix. This provides a secondary, reinforcing reason for increased helical disorder.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation:** The removal of the $\\text{C}_{2}$ hydroxyl group disrupts key stabilizing hydrogen bonds and alters stereoelectronic preferences, leading to a less stable and less uniform helix. This results in weaker binding of iodine (less negative $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$) and the formation of shorter polyiodide segments within the helix, causing a shift of $\\lambda_{\\max}$ to shorter wavelengths.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$ becomes less negative and $\\lambda_{\\max}$ shifts to shorter wavelength (hypsochromic), because removing the $\\text{O}_{2}\\!-\\!\\text{H}$ group eliminates key intrachain hydrogen bonds and weakens the stereoelectronic bias (gauche/exo-anomeric preferences) that enforce a rigid, uniformly dimensioned helix, thereby reducing the capacity to template extended polyiodide.**\nThis option correctly predicts that $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$ becomes less negative and $\\lambda_{\\max}$ shifts hypsochromically. The rationale provided is precisely the one derived from the given foundational facts: loss of stabilizing hydrogen bonds and disruption of stereoelectronic effects lead to a less rigid helix, which in turn cannot template long polyiodide chains.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$ becomes more negative and $\\lambda_{\\max}$ shifts to longer wavelength (bathochromic), because eliminating the polar $\\text{O}_{2}\\!-\\!\\text{H}$ group increases the hydrophobicity of the cavity, enhancing stabilization of polyiodide and tightening the helix.**\nThis option makes incorrect predictions for both $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$ and $\\lambda_{\\max}$. The rationale is flawed. The $\\text{O}_{2}\\!-\\!\\text{H}$ group points away from the helical axis and does not line the interior of the cavity, so its removal has a negligible effect on the cavity's hydrophobicity. More importantly, it incorrectly asserts that the helix will be \"tightened,\" directly contradicting the consequence of removing critical hydrogen bonds as stated in Fact (ii).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. No significant change in either $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$ or $\\lambda_{\\max}$, because iodine binding depends primarily on the degree of polymerization $n$ and branching frequency, not on the specific hydroxylation pattern of each residue.**\nThis option is incorrect. While the degree of polymerization and branching are indeed important parameters, the problem is specifically designed to isolate the effect of the local monomer structure by keeping these macroscopic parameters constant. The foundational facts (ii) and (iii) explicitly link the local hydroxylation pattern (via hydrogen bonding) to the helix stability and the properties of the iodine complex. To claim the hydroxylation pattern is insignificant contradicts the premises of the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$ becomes less negative but $\\lambda_{\\max}$ shifts to longer wavelength (bathochromic), because the deoxy substitution loosens the helix yet allows assembly of longer polyiodide chains in a wider cavity.**\nThis option correctly predicts the change in $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$ but incorrectly predicts the change in $\\lambda_{\\max}$. The rationale is internally contradictory. It correctly states that the substitution \"loosens the helix,\" which implies greater disorder. However, it then incorrectly concludes that a loosened, disordered helix would allow the assembly of *longer* polyiodide chains. A regular, uniform template is required to form long chains; a disordered \"loose\" template would lead to shorter, interrupted chains, and thus a shift to a shorter, not longer, wavelength.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2826436"}]}
