The problem is objective and contains no contradictions or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is valid.\n\nA solution is now pursued. The derivation must begin from fundamental principles as instructed.\n\nThe rate of a first-order reaction is described by the differential equation:\n$$-\\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k[P]$$\nwhere $[P]$ is the concentration of the peptide bond at time $t$, and $k$ is the first-order rate constant. Integration of this equation from time $t=0$ (with initial concentration $[P]_0$) to time $t$ (with concentration $[P]_t$) yields the integrated rate law:\n$$ \\int_{[P]_0}^{[P]_t} \\frac{d[P]}{[P]} = - \\int_{0}^{t} k \\,dt $$\n$$ \\ln([P]_t) - \\ln([P]_0) = -kt $$\nThis can be expressed in exponential form:\n$$ [P]_t = [P]_0 \\exp(-kt) $$\nThe half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is defined as the time at which the concentration of the reactant has fallen to half of its initial value. That is, at $t = t_{1/2}$, $[P]_{t_{1/2}} = \\frac{1}{2}[P]_0$. Substituting this definition into the integrated rate law:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}[P]_0 = [P]_0 \\exp(-k t_{1/2}) $$\nDividing by $[P]_0$ (which is non-zero) gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k t_{1/2}) $$\nTo solve for $t_{1/2}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k t_{1/2} $$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(a/b) = \\ln(a) - \\ln(b)$, and knowing $\\ln(1) = 0$:\n$$ -\\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2} $$\nTherefore, the expression for the half-life of a first-order process is:\n$$ t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k} $$\nWe are given the rate constant $k = 6.0 \\times 10^{-11} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

However, proteins are kinetically stable. This stability is a direct consequence of a high activation energy ($E_a$) for the uncatalyzed hydrolysis reaction. The origin of this high activation barrier lies in the electronic structure of the amide linkage. The lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom is delocalized into the carbonyl group, creating resonance stabilization. This gives the carbon-nitrogen bond significant double-bond character (approximately $40\\%$).\nThe hydrolysis reaction proceeds via nucleophilic attack of a water molecule on the carbonyl carbon to form a tetrahedral intermediate. This process requires disrupting the resonance stabilization of the planar amide bond, which has a substantial energy cost. Furthermore, this electron delocalization reduces the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon, making it a less favorable target for attack by a weak nucleophile like water. The combination of these factors results in a very high activation energy barrier, rendering the uncatalyzed reaction exceedingly slow at physiological temperatures. This is precisely why the calculated half-life is on the order of centuries. Enzymes, specifically proteases, catalyze this reaction by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a much lower activation energy, but in their absence, proteins are remarkably persistent.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{366}$$", "id": "2775355"}, {"introduction": "Building a peptide from its constituent amino acids is a cornerstone of modern biotechnology, achieved through methods like Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS).

The synthesis of an $n$-mer from a pre-loaded resin requires $n-1$ successful coupling reactions. Since each coupling is an independent probabilistic event with a success probability of $e$, the probability of a single peptide chain undergoing all $n-1$ couplings successfully is the product of the individual probabilities, which is $e^{n-1}$.\n    The overall yield of the solid-phase synthesis stage, $Y_{synth}$, is therefore:\n    $$Y_{synth} = e^{n-1} = (0.99)^{19}$$\n    The number of moles of full-length peptide correctly synthesized and remaining on the resin, $N_{full\\_length}$, is:\n    $$N_{full\\_length} = N_{initial} \\times Y_{synth} = (0.300 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ mol}) \\times (0.99)^{19}$$\n    The mass of this full-length material on the resin, which we define as the theoretical crude mass after chain assembly, is:\n    $$m_{crude\\_FL} = N_{full\\_length} \\times M = (N_{initial} \\times e^{n-1}) \\times M = m_{max} \\times e^{n-1}$$\n    $$m_{crude\\_FL} = (660 \\text{ mg}) \\times (0.99)^{19} \\approx 660 \\times 0.8262 \\approx 545.3 \\text{ mg}$$\n\n3.  **Actual Isolated Mass ($m_{isolated}$):**\n    This is the final mass of pure peptide obtained after the downstream processing steps of cleavage, precipitation, and purification. Each step has an associated recovery factor, and the total recovery yield, $Y_{recovery}$, is the product of these individual factors.\n    $$Y_{recovery} = r_{\\text{clv}} \\times r_{\\text{prec}} \\times r_{\\text{pur}} = 0.92 \\times 0.88 \\times 0.70 = 0.56672$$\n    The final isolated mass, $m_{isolated}$, is the mass of the full-length peptide on the resin multiplied by this total recovery yield.\n    $$m_{isolated} = m_{crude\\_FL} \\times Y_{recovery} = m_{max} \\times e^{n-1} \\times Y_{recovery}$$\n    $$m_{isolated} \\approx (545.3 \\text{ mg}) \\times 0.56672 \\approx 309.0 \\text{ mg}$$\n\nNow, we address the qualitative aspects of the problem.\nThe crude product, after cleavage from the resin, is a mixture. Its purity is the mole fraction (or mass fraction) of the full-length target sequence relative to the total material. The primary impurities are deletion sequences, which are shorter peptides that result from incomplete coupling at one or more steps. The total yield of full-length product after $n-1$ steps is $Y_{synth} = e^{n-1}$. The yield of any failure sequence is related to the probability of failure, $(1-e)$. The major contaminant is the $(n-1)$-mer, which results from a single failure. The population of this species is distributed across all possible single-residue deletions.\n\nThe standard process changes influence crude purity as follows:\n-   **Capping of Failed Sequences:** This is a critical step. After a coupling reaction, any unreacted free amino groups are acetylated (capped) with an agent like acetic anhydride. This renders them inert to further coupling reactions. Without capping, a chain that failed to couple at step $k$ could react at step $k+1$, leading to a product with an internal deletion. Such peptides have very similar masses and hydrophobicities to the desired full-length product, making them exceedingly difficult to separate by HPLC. Capping ensures that all failure sequences are terminally truncated (e.g., $(n-1)$-mer, $(n-2)$-mer, etc.). These shorter peptides have significantly different properties and are easily separated, thus dramatically increasing the effective purity of the crude material and simplifying purification.\n-   **Double-Coupling:** For difficult couplings (e.g., due to steric hindrance), the reaction can be performed twice. If a single coupling has an efficiency $e$, the failure rate is $1-e$. Performing the reaction again on the unreacted sites with the same efficiency results in a new failure rate of $(1-e)^2$. The new step efficiency becomes $e' = 1 - (1-e)^2$. For $e=0.99$, the new efficiency is $e' = 1 - (0.01)^2 = 0.9999$. This seemingly small improvement in single-step efficiency has a profound cumulative effect on the final yield of the full-length product, given by $(e')^{n-1}$. A higher yield of the target sequence directly translates to higher crude purity.\n-   **Choice of Activator/Base:** The rate and completeness of the amide bond formation are dictated by the activation chemistry. Modern activators (uronium/guanidinium salts like HATU, HCTU, HBTU) combined with additives (like Oxyma Pure) and a hindered, non-nucleophilic base (like N,N-Diisopropylethylamine, DIPEA) are designed to form the activated ester rapidly and promote fast acylation while minimizing side reactions like racemization of the C-terminal chiral center of the incoming amino acid. A more potent activation system drives the reaction closer to completion in a shorter time, effectively increasing the per-step coupling efficiency $e$, which, as explained, directly enhances the final crude purity.\n\nFinally, we compute the required ratio of the actual isolated mass to the theoretical maximum isolated mass. This dimensionless quantity represents the total overall yield of the entire process.\n$$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{m_{isolated}}{m_{max}} = \\frac{m_{max} \\times e^{n-1} \\times Y_{recovery}}{m_{max}} = e^{n-1} \\times Y_{recovery}$$\n$$\\text{Ratio} = (0.99)^{19} \\times (0.92 \\times 0.88 \\times 0.70)$$\n$$\\text{Ratio} = (0.99)^{19} \\times 0.56672$$\n$$\\text{Ratio} \\approx 0.826202 \\times 0.56672 \\approx 0.468246$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives $0.4682$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4682}$$", "id": "2775400"}]}
