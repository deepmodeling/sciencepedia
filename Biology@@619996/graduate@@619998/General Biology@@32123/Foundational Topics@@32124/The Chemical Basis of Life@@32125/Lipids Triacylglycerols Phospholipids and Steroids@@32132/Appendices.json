It is well-posed, providing all necessary data ($v$, $a_0$, $\\ell$ for both components) and a clear, objective set of rules (ideal mixing) to determine a unique solution. The language is precise and free of ambiguity or subjective claims. The numerical values provided for the lipids are physically realistic. The problem does not violate any criteria for validity; it is a standard, solvable problem in physical chemistry or biophysics.\n\nStep 3: Verdict\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe first task is to derive the dimensionless parameter that governs the self-assembled morphology. This parameter, often called the critical packing parameter $P$, relates the volume occupied by the hydrophobic tail, $v$, to the volume of a cylinder defined by the headgroup area $a_0$ and the maximal tail length $\\ell$. The dimensionless parameter is constructed as the ratio of these two volumes:\n$$\nP = \\frac{v}{a_0 \\ell}\n$$\nThis parameter represents the effective shape of the molecule. We now analyze the geometric constraints for different aggregate shapes, assuming an aggregate of $N$ molecules, a total hydrophobic volume of $V = Nv$, and a total interfacial area of $A = Na_0$. The critical constraint is that the radius of curvature of the hydrophobic core, $R$, cannot exceed the maximal chain length, $\\ell$, i.e., $R \\le \\ell$. The upper bounds for $P$ are found when this condition is maximal, $R = \\ell$.\n\n1.  Spherical Micelles:\nThe hydrophobic core is a sphere of radius $R$. Its volume is $V_{sphere} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$ and its surface area is $A_{sphere} = 4\\pi R^2$. Equating these with the aggregate properties:\n$Nv = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$\n$Na_0 = 4\\pi R^2$\nDividing the volume equation by the area equation gives:\n$\\frac{v}{a_0} = \\frac{R}{3}$\nSubstituting this into the definition of $P$:\n$P = \\frac{v}{a_0 \\ell} = \\frac{R/3}{\\ell} = \\frac{R}{3\\ell}$\nApplying the constraint $R \\le \\ell$, we find the upper bound for stable spherical micelles:\n$P \\le \\frac{\\ell}{3\\ell} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n2.  Cylindrical Micelles:\nThe hydrophobic core is an infinitely long cylinder of radius $R$. For a segment of length $L_{cyl}$, the volume is $V_{cyl} = \\pi R^2 L_{cyl}$ and the interfacial area is $A_{cyl} = 2\\pi R L_{cyl}$. Equating these with aggregate properties:\n$Nv = \\pi R^2 L_{cyl}$\n$Na_0 = 2\\pi R L_{cyl}$\nDividing the equations yields:\n$\\frac{v}{a_0} = \\frac{R}{2}$\nSubstituting into the definition of $P$:\n$P = \\frac{v}{a_0 \\ell} = \\frac{R/2}{\\ell} = \\frac{R}{2\\ell}$\nApplying the constraint $R \\le \\ell$, we find the upper bound for stable cylindrical micelles:\n$P \\le \\frac{\\ell}{2\\ell} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n3.  Planar Bilayers:\nThe hydrophobic core is a planar sheet of thickness $2R$. For a patch of area $A_{patch}$, the volume is $V_{bilayer} = A_{patch} \\cdot (2R)$. The total number of molecules $N$ is distributed over two interfaces, each of area $A_{patch}$, so the total interfacial area is $A_{bilayer} = 2 A_{patch}$. Equating:\n$Nv = A_{patch} \\cdot (2R)$\n$Na_0 = 2 A_{patch}$\nDividing the equations leads to:\n$\\frac{v}{a_0} = R$\nSubstituting into the definition of $P$:\n$P = \\frac{v}{a_0 \\ell} = \\frac{R}{\\ell}$\nWith the constraint $R \\le \\ell$, the upper bound for stable planar bilayers is:\n$P \\le \\frac{\\ell}{\\ell} = 1$\n\nThe sequence of morphologies as $P$ increases is rationalized by the required interfacial curvature. Small $P$ (large $a_0$ relative to $v$) favors high curvature (spheres). As $P$ increases, curvature must decrease, leading to cylinders and then planar bilayers. For $P > 1$, it is geometrically necessary for the interface to curve in the opposite direction (water-in-oil), resulting in inverted or reverse structures.\n\nThe problem asks for the mole fraction $x^{\\ast}$ at which the mixture transitions from a bilayer to a cylindrical morphology. This transition occurs at the boundary value $P = 1/2$. We must solve the following equation for $x^*$:\n$$\nP(x^{\\ast}) = \\frac{v(x^{\\ast})}{a_{0}(x^{\\ast}) \\ell(x^{\\ast})} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe temperature of $298\\ \\mathrm{K}$ is irrelevant information for this purely geometric model. Substituting the given ideal mixing rules:\n$$\n2 \\left[ x v_{A} + (1-x) v_{B} \\right] = \\left[ x a_{0,A} + (1-x) a_{0,B} \\right] \\left[ x \\ell_{A} + (1-x) \\ell_{B} \\right]\n$$\nThis can be rewritten using differences: $\\Delta v = v_A - v_B$, $\\Delta a_0 = a_{0,A} - a_{0,B}$, and $\\Delta \\ell = \\ell_A - \\ell_B$.\n$$\n2 \\left[ v_B + x\\Delta v \\right] = \\left[ a_{0,B} + x\\Delta a_0 \\right] \\left[ \\ell_B + x\\Delta \\ell \\right]\n$$\nExpanding and rearranging this into a standard quadratic form $Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0$:\n$$\n(\\Delta a_0 \\Delta \\ell) x^2 + (a_{0,B} \\Delta \\ell + \\ell_B \\Delta a_0 - 2\\Delta v) x + (a_{0,B} \\ell_B - 2v_B) = 0\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided, all in their respective nm units:\n$v_{A} = 0.35$, $v_{B} = 0.90 \\implies \\Delta v = 0.35 - 0.90 = -0.55$\n$a_{0,A} = 0.70$, $a_{0,B} = 0.60 \\implies \\Delta a_0 = 0.70 - 0.60 = 0.10$\n$\\ell_{A} = 1.60$, $\\ell_{B} = 1.80 \\implies \\Delta \\ell = 1.60 - 1.80 = -0.20$\n\nThe coefficients of the quadratic equation are:\n$A = \\Delta a_0 \\Delta \\ell = (0.10)(-0.20) = -0.02$\n$B = a_{0,B} \\Delta \\ell + \\ell_B \\Delta a_0 - 2\\Delta v = (0.60)(-0.20) + (1.80)(0.10) - 2(-0.55) = -0.12 + 0.18 + 1.10 = 1.16$\n$C = a_{0,B} \\ell_B - 2v_B = (0.60)(1.80) - 2(0.90) = 1.08 - 1.80 = -0.72$\n\nThe equation to be solved for $x$ is:\n$$\n-0.02 x^2 + 1.16 x - 0.72 = 0\n$$\nMultiplying by $-50$ for convenience gives:\n$$\nx^2 - 58 x + 36 = 0\n$$\nWe use the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=1$, $b=-58$, and $c=36$:\n$$\nx = \\frac{-(-58) \\pm \\sqrt{(-58)^2 - 4(1)(36)}}{2(1)}\n$$\n$$\nx = \\frac{58 \\pm \\sqrt{3364 - 144}}{2}\n$$\n$$\nx = \\frac{58 \\pm \\sqrt{3220}}{2}\n$$\nThis yields two solutions:\n$x_1 = \\frac{58 + \\sqrt{3220}}{2} \\approx \\frac{58 + 56.745}{2} \\approx 57.37$\n$x_2 = \\frac{58 - \\sqrt{3220}}{2} \\approx \\frac{58 - 56.745}{2} \\approx 0.6275$\n\nSince $x$ is a mole fraction, it must lie in the physical domain $x \\in [0,1]$.

Since the value is consistent and lies in the interval $[0, 1]$, it is confirmed that the bulk mixture composition lies on the tie-line connecting the given Lo and Ld phase compositions. Thus, the mixture will undergo macroscopic phase separation.\n\nThe mole fraction of the Ld phase is $f_{\\mathrm{Ld}} = 0.6$. The mole fraction of the Lo phase is then determined from the conservation equation:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{Lo}} = 1 - f_{\\mathrm{Ld}} = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4 $$\nThe problem states to assume that the area per molecule is uniform across all components and phases. This simplification implies that the domain area fractions are equal to the mole fractions of the phases.\nTherefore, the domain area fraction of the Lo phase is $0.4$, and the domain area fraction of the Ld phase is $0.6$.\n\nThe question requires rounding the answer to four significant figures.\n$f_{\\mathrm{Lo}} = 0.4000$\n$f_{\\mathrm{Ld}} = 0.6000$\n\nThe final answer is the ordered pair $\\left(f_{\\mathrm{Lo}}, f_{\\mathrm{Ld}}\\right)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n(0.4000, 0.6000)\n}\n$$", "id": "2813079"}]}
