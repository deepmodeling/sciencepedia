This practice explores this fundamental principle using the framework of evolutionary game theory. By modeling the interactions between cooperative and \"cheater\" cells, you will use replicator dynamics to determine the conditions under which a policing mechanism can stabilize the higher-level entity, providing insight into the evolution of hierarchical control [@problem_id:2804751].", "problem": "Consider a simple evolutionary game within a multicellular organism, where cell-level selection acts on two strategies at the lower hierarchical level (cells) that together constitute the higher-level organism: cooperators that contribute to organismal function and cheaters that do not. Let $x$ denote the frequency of cooperators and $1 - x$ the frequency of cheaters in a large, well-mixed cellular population.\n\nAssume the following fundamentals and definitions are valid for this system:\n- The two-strategy replicator dynamics apply, so that the temporal change in the frequency of cooperators satisfies $\\dot{x} = x \\left(f_{C}(x) - \\bar{f}(x)\\right)$, where $f_{C}(x)$ is the fitness of cooperators, $f_{D}(x)$ is the fitness of cheaters (defectors), and $\\bar{f}(x) = x f_{C}(x) + (1 - x) f_{D}(x)$ is the mean fitness.\n- Cooperation produces a shared benefit: each cooperator contributes benefit $b$ to a common pool that is evenly shared among all cells, producing a per-capita benefit $b x$.\n- Each cooperator pays a direct cost of cooperation $c$ and also invests in policing at an effort level $p \\ge 0$. The per-cooperator policing cost scales linearly with effort and equals $r p$, where $r > 0$ is the cost coefficient.\n- Policing is enacted by cooperators and imposes a sanction on cheaters that scales linearly with both the aggregate policing level and the prevalence of cooperators. A cheater therefore suffers a fitness penalty $s p x$, where $s > 0$ is the sanction effectiveness coefficient.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the per-capita fitnesses are\n$f_{C}(x) = b x - c - r p$ and $f_{D}(x) = b x - s p x$.\n\nUsing only the replicator dynamics and the rare-mutant invasion criterion grounded in fitness differences, compute the critical policing effort $p^{*}$ such that for $p > p^{*}$ a rare cheater cannot invade a resident, all-cooperator population. Express your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $b$, $c$, $r$, and $s$. If $b$ does not appear in the final expression, this should follow from your derivation. No numerical evaluation is required, and no units are needed for the final expression.", "solution": "The problem requires the determination of a critical policing effort, denoted as $p^{*}$, for a system of cooperators and cheaters governed by replicator dynamics. The criterion to be used is the rare-mutant invasion criterion, specifically to find the condition under which a rare cheater cannot invade a resident population of cooperators.\n\nThe state of the system is described by $x$, the frequency of cooperators, where $x \\in [0, 1]$. The frequency of cheaters is $1-x$. The dynamics are given by the replicator equation, which can be expressed in terms of the fitness difference between the two strategies:\n$$ \\dot{x} = x(1-x)(f_C(x) - f_D(x)) $$\nHere, $f_C(x)$ is the fitness of a cooperator and $f_D(x)$ is the fitness of a cheater. The provided fitness functions are:\n$$ f_C(x) = b x - c - r p $$\n$$ f_D(x) = b x - s p x $$\nwhere $b$ is the benefit of cooperation, $c$ is the cost of cooperation, $p$ is the policing effort ($p \\ge 0$), $r$ is the cost coefficient of policing ($r > 0$), and $s$ is the sanction effectiveness coefficient ($s > 0$).\n\nThe \"rare-mutant invasion criterion\" dictates the stability of a monomorphic population (a pure strategy equilibrium) against invasion by a small number of mutants. In our case, the resident population consists of cooperators, which corresponds to the equilibrium state $x=1$. The mutant is the cheater strategy, which is present at an infinitesimally small frequency.\n\nA rare cheater cannot invade the all-cooperator population if the fitness of the cheater is less than the fitness of the cooperator in an environment where cooperators are overwhelmingly abundant. Mathematically, this condition is expressed as:\n$$ f_D(x) < f_C(x) \\quad \\text{in the limit as } x \\to 1 $$\nThis is equivalent to analyzing the stability of the equilibrium point $x=1$. For $x=1$ to be a stable equilibrium, the time derivative $\\dot{x}$ must be positive for values of $x$ just below $1$ (i.e., $x = 1 - \\epsilon$ for some small $\\epsilon > 0$). From the equation $\\dot{x} = x(1-x)(f_C(x) - f_D(x))$, with $x(1-x) > 0$ for $x \\in (0, 1)$, this stability condition requires that the fitness difference $f_C(x) - f_D(x)$ is positive as $x$ approaches $1$.\n\nLet's establish the inequality $f_C(x) > f_D(x)$ and substitute the given expressions for the fitness functions:\n$$ b x - c - r p > b x - s p x $$\nThe term $b x$, representing the shared benefit of cooperation, is present on both sides of the inequality and thus cancels out. This demonstrates that the shared benefit does not influence the relative success of cooperators versus cheaters, and as a consequence, the parameter $b$ will not appear in the final expression for $p^*$. The inequality simplifies to:\n$$ -c - r p > - s p x $$\nRearranging the terms to isolate those involving $p$:\n$$ s p x - r p > c $$\n$$ p(s x - r) > c $$\n\nThis inequality must hold for a population that is almost entirely composed of cooperators. We evaluate this condition in the limit as the frequency of cooperators $x$ approaches $1$:\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to 1} p(s x - r) > c $$\n$$ p(s(1) - r) > c $$\n$$ p(s - r) > c $$\n\nThis final inequality gives the condition on the policing effort $p$ that ensures the stability of the all-cooperator state. The problem asks for a critical value $p^{*}$ such that the condition holds for all $p > p^{*}$. The existence and form of this solution depend on the sign of the coefficient $(s-r)$.\n\nCase 1: $s - r > 0$.\nIf $s > r$, the term $(s-r)$ is positive. We can divide the inequality by this term without altering the direction of the inequality:\n$$ p > \\frac{c}{s - r} $$\nThis result shows that if the policing effort $p$ exceeds the value $\\frac{c}{s - r}$, cooperators can resist invasion by cheaters. This value is the critical threshold $p^{*}$.\n$$ p^{*} = \\frac{c}{s - r} $$\nThe premise of the question, which asks for such a $p^{*}$, implies that this is the relevant regime. This condition $s>r$ is also logical from a biological standpoint: for policing to be a viable strategy, its per-effort effectiveness in sanctioning cheaters ($s$) must outweigh its per-effort cost to the cooperator ($r$).\n\nCase 2: $s - r \\le 0$.\nIf $s \\le r$, the cost of policing is greater than or equal to its effectiveness.\nIf $s = r$, the stability condition becomes $p(0) > c$, which simplifies to $0 > c$. Assuming cooperation has a non-zero cost ($c > 0$), this is a contradiction, and no value of $p$ can stabilize cooperation.\nIf $s < r$, the term $(s-r)$ is negative. Dividing the inequality $p(s-r) > c$ by this negative term reverses the direction of the inequality:\n$$ p < \\frac{c}{s - r} $$\nWith $c > 0$ and $s - r < 0$, the right-hand side is a negative number. However, the policing effort $p$ must be non-negative ($p \\ge 0$). There is no value of $p \\ge 0$ that can satisfy this condition.\nTherefore, if $s \\le r$, the all-cooperator state can never be stable against invasion by cheaters, regardless of the level of policing effort.\n\nBased on the structure of the problem statement, we must be in the regime where a solution exists, which is $s > r$. The critical policing effort $p^{*}$ is the minimum value that satisfies the stability condition, which is the boundary of the inequality.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{c}{s - r}}\n$$", "id": "2804751"}, {"introduction": "When a population is structured into groups, natural selection can operate on multiple levels simultaneously.
