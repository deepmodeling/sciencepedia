It is a standard exercise in biophysical chemistry concerning the principles of molecular self-assembly. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe molecular packing parameter, $p$, is a dimensionless quantity that relates the geometry of an amphiphilic molecule to the geometry of the aggregate it forms in an aqueous solution. This parameter arises from fundamental geometric constraints required for the space-filling aggregation of molecules, which seeks to minimize the free energy of the system.\n\nConsider an aggregate composed of $N$ identical lipid molecules. The total volume of the hydrophobic core of the aggregate, $V_{agg}$, must be equal to the sum of the volumes of the individual hydrocarbon tails.\n$$V_{agg} = N v$$\nThe total surface area of the hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface, $A_{agg}$, must be equal to the sum of the optimal headgroup areas of the constituent molecules.\n$$A_{agg} = N a_{0}$$\nFrom a purely geometric standpoint, the volume of the aggregate can be related to its surface area and its average thickness or radius, which we can call $L_{eff}$. For any simple geometry, $V_{agg}$ is proportional to $A_{agg} \\times L_{eff}$. A critical physical constraint is that the chains cannot be stretched beyond their maximum possible contour length, $l$. Therefore, the effective thickness of the hydrocarbon core must be less than or equal to this maximum length.\n$$L_{eff} \\le l$$\nCombining these relationships, we have $V_{agg} \\approx A_{agg} L_{eff}$, which upon substituting the molecular-level quantities gives $N v \\approx (N a_{0}) L_{eff}$. This simplifies to $v \\approx a_{0} L_{eff}$.\nApplying the constraint $L_{eff} \\le l$, we arrive at the inequality $v \\le a_{0} l$.\n\nThe molecular packing parameter, $p$, is defined as the ratio of the actual volume of the hydrocarbon tail, $v$, to the volume of a hypothetical cylinder whose base is the optimal headgroup area, $a_{0}$, and whose height is the maximum chain length, $l$. This parameter quantifies the effective shape of the molecule.\n$$p = \\frac{v}{a_0 l}$$\nThis expression relates the intrinsic molecular properties ($v$, $a_{0}$, $l$) to a single dimensionless parameter $p$ that predicts the preferred aggregate morphology.\n\nNow, we compute the value of $p$ using the provided data:\n$v = 1.1\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{3}$\n$a_{0} = 0.65\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{2}$\n$l = 1.7\\ \\mathrm{nm}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $p$:\n$$p = \\frac{1.1}{0.65 \\times 1.7} = \\frac{1.1}{1.105}$$\n$$p \\approx 0.995475113...$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we get:\n$$p \\approx 0.9955$$\n\nThe value of the packing parameter $p$ determines the preferred curvature of the aggregate interface and thus its overall morphology. The established ranges are:\n- $p < \\frac{1}{3}$: Favors high positive curvature, forming spherical micelles. The molecular shape is strongly conical.\n- $\\frac{1}{3} < p < \\frac{1}{2}$: Favors moderate positive curvature, forming cylindrical micelles. The molecular shape is a truncated cone.\n- $\\frac{1}{2} < p < 1$: Favors low positive curvature, forming flexible bilayers or vesicles.\n- $p \\approx 1$: Favors zero curvature, forming planar lamellar bilayers. The molecular shape is nearly cylindrical.\n- $p > 1$: Favors negative curvature (interface curved toward the aqueous phase), forming inverted phases. The molecular shape is an inverted truncated cone.\n\nOur calculated value is $p \\approx 0.9955$, which is extremely close to $1$. This indicates that the favored morphology is a planar lamellar bilayer.\n\nThe mechanistic justification is as follows. The packing parameter $p$ reflects the effective geometric shape of the lipid molecule.\n- When $p \\approx 1$, as in this case, it implies that $v \\approx a_0 l$. This means the volume of the hydrocarbon tail is almost exactly what would be required to fill a cylinder of height $l$ and base area $a_0$. The molecule is effectively cylindrical.\n- To pack cylindrical-shaped molecules into an aggregate without creating energetically costly voids in the hydrophobic core (chain packing frustration) or forcing headgroups too close together or too far apart (interfacial energy penalty), the optimal arrangement is a flat sheet.\n- A planar lamellar bilayer has zero mean curvature. This geometry allows the cylindrical lipid molecules to pack side-by-side with their axes parallel, perfectly satisfying the requirement for the headgroup area ($a_0$) at the interface while simultaneously allowing the chains to fill the core volume ($v$) over their length ($l$) without significant compression, stretching, or creation of empty space.\n- Any other geometry with non-zero curvature (e.g., spherical or cylindrical micelles) would force these cylindrical molecules into a configuration that creates packing defects, increasing the system's free energy. For instance, packing cylinders into a sphere would create large voids near the center or require significant chain compression, both of which are energetically unfavorable. Therefore, driven by the minimization of free energy, these lipids self-assemble into planar bilayers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9955}$$", "id": "2815031"}, {"introduction": "The hydrophobic thickness of a lipid bilayer is a critical parameter influencing membrane protein function and overall membrane stability.

It contains no contradictions, missing information, or pseudoscientific claims. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe effects of cholesterol on a lipid bilayer are quintessential examples of its dual regulatory role, which depends critically on the initial phase state of the lipids. The cholesterol molecule is amphipathic, with a rigid, planar steroid ring system and a small hydroxyl headgroup. This structure allows it to intercalate between phospholipid molecules.\n\n**1. Effect on DOPC (Liquid-Disordered Phase)**\nAt $T=25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, DOPC is in the liquid-disordered ($L_d$) phase, meaning $T > T_m$. In this state, the unsaturated acyl chains are conformationally mobile and disordered, leading to low chain packing density, low orientational order, and high lateral mobility.\n- **Change in $D$:** When cholesterol is introduced, its rigid, planar ring structure fits into the spaces between the fluid acyl chains. This fills free volume and increases van der Waals interactions between molecules. This process, known as the \"condensing effect,\" hinders the lateral movement of the phospholipids. Consequently, the lateral diffusion coefficient $D$ **decreases**.\n- **Change in $S_{CD}$:** The same interaction that condenses the membrane also orders it. The rigid sterol ring restricts the conformational freedom (trans-gauche isomerizations) of the proximal segments of the phospholipid acyl chains, forcing them into a more extended, all-trans-like conformation. This increases their average alignment with the bilayer normal. Therefore, the deuterium order parameter $S_{CD}$ **increases**. The resulting state is known as the liquid-ordered ($L_o$) phase.\n- **Change in $T_m$ behavior:** For lipids already in the fluid phase, the addition of cholesterol progressively broadens and eventually, at concentrations like $30\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\%$, completely abolishes the sharp, cooperative main phase transition from a gel to a liquid phase. Since the $T_m$ of DOPC is already far below $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, the main transition is not observed near this temperature in the pure system. With cholesterol, the system is in the $L_o$ phase, and no sharp cooperative transition is present. Thus, the calorimetric main transition remains absent.\n\n**2. Effect on DPPC (Gel Phase)**\nAt $T=25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, DPPC is in the gel ($L_{\\beta'}$) phase, meaning $T < T_m$. In this state, the saturated acyl chains are in a nearly all-trans conformation, tightly packed in a quasi-crystalline lattice, resulting in very high orientational order and extremely low lateral mobility.\n- **Change in $D$:** The bulky, rigid cholesterol molecule cannot pack efficiently into the highly ordered, crystalline-like lattice of the gel-phase lipids. Its presence disrupts this tight packing, introducing defects and increasing the average distance between phospholipid molecules. This \"fluidizing effect\" breaks down the rigid lattice and allows for significantly more lateral motion. Consequently, the lateral diffusion coefficient $D$ **increases markedly**, as the system transitions from a solid-like gel state to a fluid-like $L_o$ state.\n- **Change in $S_{CD}$:** This point is subtle. The gel phase is characterized by extremely high orientational order ($S_{CD}$ is high). Although cholesterol's rigid ring system orders the upper segments of the acyl chains it is in contact with, it simultaneously disrupts the long-range collective order of the gel lattice. The resulting $L_o$ phase, while being \"ordered\" relative to an $L_d$ phase, is less ordered than the pristine, crystal-like gel phase. Experimental evidence from NMR confirms that the average $S_{CD}$ in the $L_o$ phase (formed from a gel-phase lipid below its $T_m$) is lower than in the pure gel phase at the same temperature. Therefore, $S_{CD}$ **decreases**.\n- **Change in $T_m$ behavior:** In a pure DPPC bilayer, heating from $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ would result in a sharp, highly cooperative main phase transition at $T_m \\approx 41\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. Cholesterol's disruption of the gel phase packing prevents the cooperative melting of the entire lattice. As cholesterol concentration increases, the sharp transition peak observed in calorimetry is progressively broadened, lowered in enthalpy, and the effective transition temperature is lowered. At $30\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\%$, the cooperative main transition is completely **suppressed and broadened**, being replaced by a state ($L_o$) that has no sharp melting point.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.
