The parameters provided are physically realistic for Gram-negative bacteria. The problem is well-posed, with a clear objective and sufficient information to derive unique solutions for the requested quantities. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the validation criteria (e.g., scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, ambiguity).\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Calculation of Hoop Stress**\n\nTo derive the circumferential (hoop) stress $\\sigma_h$ in the cylindrical wall, we consider a section of the cylinder of length $L$. We imagine making a longitudinal cut through the cylinder, dividing it into two halves. We then analyze the force balance on one of these halves.\n\nThe internal pressure $P$ exerts an outward force on the internal surfaces. For the half-cylinder, this pressure acts on the projected rectangular area of dimensions $2r \\times L$. The total outward force due to pressure is:\n$$F_{pressure} = P \\times (2rL)$$\n\nThis outward force must be balanced by the tensile forces within the material of the cell wall at the points where it was cut. The cut exposes two sections of the wall, each with a cross-sectional area of $L \\times t$. The total cross-sectional area of the wall resisting the pressure-induced force is therefore $A_{wall} = 2(Lt)$.\n\nThe total tensile force in the wall is the product of the hoop stress $\\sigma_h$ and this resisting area:\n$$F_{wall} = \\sigma_h \\times A_{wall} = \\sigma_h \\times (2Lt)$$\n\nFor mechanical equilibrium, the outward force from pressure must equal the restraining force in the wall:\n$$F_{pressure} = F_{wall}$$\n$$P(2rL) = \\sigma_h(2Lt)$$\n\nWe can cancel the terms $2L$ from both sides of the equation, which shows that the result is independent of the arbitrary length $L$ chosen for the analysis.\n$$Pr = \\sigma_h t$$\n\nSolving for the hoop stress $\\sigma_h$, we obtain the well-known Barlow's formula for thin-walled cylinders:\n$$\\sigma_h = \\frac{Pr}{t}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $P = 3.0 \\times 10^{5} \\,\\textrm{Pa}$\n- $r = 5.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\,\\textrm{m}$\n- $t = 3.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\textrm{m}$\n\n$$\\sigma_h = \\frac{(3.0 \\times 10^{5} \\,\\textrm{Pa}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\,\\textrm{m})}{3.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\textrm{m}} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-1}}{3.0 \\times 10^{-9}} \\,\\textrm{Pa} = 0.5 \\times 10^{8} \\,\\textrm{Pa} = 5.0 \\times 10^{7} \\,\\textrm{Pa}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the hoop stress is $5.000 \\times 10^{7} \\,\\textrm{Pa}$.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation and Calculation of Minimal Cross-link Density**\n\nNext, we establish the macroscopic yield criterion for the PG network. The problem asks us to relate the macroscopic stress to the microscopic properties of the cross-links. The yield stress of the network, $\\sigma_{yield}$, is the maximum stress the material can sustain before failure.\n\nWe consider a unit area of the cell wall. This area contains, on average, $\\rho$ cross-links. Each cross-link can sustain a maximum tensile force $f_b$. If all links were perfectly aligned with the applied load, the yield stress would be $\\rho f_b$. However, the network is isotropic, meaning the cross-links are oriented randomly in the plane. The problem provides an average directional projection factor $\\phi$, which accounts for this random orientation under a uniaxial load. Therefore, the effective force per cross-link in the direction of the load is $\\phi f_b$.\n\nThe total force that a unit area of the network can sustain in one direction is the number of links per unit area multiplied by the effective force contribution of each link. This gives the macroscopic yield stress:\n$$\\sigma_{yield} = \\rho \\phi f_b$$\n\nThe problem requires a safety factor $S$, such that the working stress (the hoop stress $\\sigma_h$) must not exceed the yield stress divided by $S$.\n$$\\sigma_h \\le \\frac{\\sigma_{yield}}{S}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\sigma_{yield}$:\n$$\\sigma_h \\le \\frac{\\rho \\phi f_b}{S}$$\n\nWe seek the minimal cross-link density, $\\rho_{\\min}$, required to prevent failure. This minimum density corresponds to the equality, where the wall is just strong enough to withstand the load with the specified safety margin.\n$$\\sigma_h = \\frac{\\rho_{\\min} \\phi f_b}{S}$$\n\nWe can now solve for $\\rho_{\\min}$:\n$$\\rho_{\\min} = \\frac{S \\sigma_h}{\\phi f_b}$$\n\nWe have all the necessary quantities to calculate $\\rho_{\\min}$:\n- $S = 3.0$\n- $\\sigma_h = 5.0 \\times 10^{7} \\,\\textrm{Pa}$\n- $\\phi = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$\n- $f_b = 1.2 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\textrm{N}$\n\n$$\\rho_{\\min} = \\frac{(3.0) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{7} \\,\\textrm{Pa})}{(0.5) \\times (1.2 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\textrm{N})} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{8}}{0.6 \\times 10^{-9}} \\,\\textrm{m}^{-2} = \\frac{1.5}{0.6} \\times 10^{17} \\,\\textrm{m}^{-2} = 2.5 \\times 10^{17} \\,\\textrm{m}^{-2}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the minimal cross-link density is $2.500 \\times 10^{17} \\,\\textrm{m}^{-2}$.\n\nFinal answers are:\n1.
