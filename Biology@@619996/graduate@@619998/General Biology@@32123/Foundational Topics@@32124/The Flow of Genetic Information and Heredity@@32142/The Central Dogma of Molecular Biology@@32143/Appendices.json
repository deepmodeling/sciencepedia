Using only foundational definitions from the central dogma and macromolecular enzymology, derive from first principles an exact expression for the total number of high-energy phosphate equivalents consumed by this single round, under the following explicit assumptions that reflect well-established biochemical steps:\n\n- Aminoacylation (charging) of transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases consumes adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) plus inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), which corresponds to $2$ high-energy phosphate equivalents per amino acid charged.\n- Translational elongation on the ribosome consumes guanosine triphosphate (GTP) for each elongation cycle: $1$ GTP for aminoacyl-tRNA delivery and $1$ GTP for translocation per peptide bond formed, for a total of $2$ GTP per peptide bond.

For an RNA of length $m$ nucleotides, there are $m-1$ such bonds; for each bond, cleavage of the incoming NTP to nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) plus PPi breaks one phosphoanhydride bond, and subsequent hydrolysis of PPi to two inorganic phosphates breaks a second high-energy bond.

It provides a set of clear, explicit assumptions and sufficient data to derive a unique, exact solution from first principles of molecular biology and biochemistry. The problem reduces to a straightforward calculation based on the provided bioenergetic costs for transcription and translation. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe total number of high-energy phosphate equivalents consumed, which we will denote as $E_{total}$, is the sum of the energy consumed during transcription ($E_{transcription}$) and translation ($E_{translation}$).\n$$E_{total} = E_{transcription} + E_{translation}$$\n\nFirst, we will calculate the energy cost of transcription.\nThe synthesis of a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) molecule of length $m$ nucleotides requires the formation of $m-1$ phosphodiester bonds. The problem specifies that the length of the mRNA is $m = 3000$ nucleotides. Therefore, the number of phosphodiester bonds formed is $3000 - 1 = 2999$.\nAccording to the provided assumptions, the formation of each phosphodiester bond consumes $2$ high-energy phosphate equivalents. This accounts for the cleavage of a nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) to a nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), followed by the hydrolysis of PPi.\nThe total energy cost for transcription is therefore:\n$$E_{transcription} = (m-1) \\times 2$$\nSubstituting the value $m=3000$:\n$$E_{transcription} = (3000 - 1) \\times 2 = 2999 \\times 2 = 5998$$\n\nNext, we calculate the energy cost of translation, $E_{translation}$. This process, under the given constraints, consists of two distinct energetic costs: the charging of transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules (aminoacylation), and the elongation of the polypeptide chain on the ribosome.\n$$E_{translation} = E_{aminoacylation} + E_{elongation}$$\n\nThe cost of aminoacylation, $E_{aminoacylation}$, is the energy required to attach each amino acid to its corresponding tRNA. The protein to be synthesized has a length of $n = 1000$ amino acids. Each of these $1000$ amino acids must be \"charged\" or activated. The problem states that charging one tRNA molecule consumes ATP, yielding AMP and PPi, which is equivalent to the hydrolysis of two phosphoanhydride bonds, or $2$ high-energy phosphate equivalents per amino acid.\nThe total cost for aminoacylation is:\n$$E_{aminoacylation} = n \\times 2$$\nSubstituting the value $n=1000$:\n$$E_{aminoacylation} = 1000 \\times 2 = 2000$$\n\nThe cost of elongation, $E_{elongation}$, is associated with the formation of peptide bonds. A protein of length $n$ amino acids contains $n-1$ peptide bonds. For a protein of $1000$ amino acids, this is $1000 - 1 = 999$ peptide bonds.\nThe problem states that each elongation cycle, which forms one peptide bond, consumes $2$ molecules of GTP. One GTP is used for the delivery of the aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site of the ribosome, and a second GTP is used for the translocation of the ribosome along the mRNA. Each GTP hydrolyzed to GDP is counted as $1$ high-energy phosphate equivalent. Thus, the formation of one peptide bond costs $2$ high-energy phosphate equivalents.\nThe total cost for elongation is:\n$$E_{elongation} = (n-1) \\times 2$$\nSubstituting the value $n=1000$:\n$$E_{elongation} = (1000 - 1) \\times 2 = 999 \\times 2 = 1998$$\n\nFinally, we sum these individual costs to find the total energy consumption for this single round of gene expression.\n$$E_{total} = E_{transcription} + E_{aminoacylation} + E_{elongation}$$\n$$E_{total} = 5998 + 2000 + 1998$$\n$$E_{total} = 7998 + 1998 = 9996$$\n\nAlternatively, we can construct a general formula from the symbolic expressions:\n$$E_{total} = 2(m-1) + 2n + 2(n-1)$$\n$$E_{total} = 2m - 2 + 2n + 2n - 2$$\n$$E_{total} = 2m + 4n - 4$$\nSubstituting the given values $m=3000$ and $n=1000$:\n$$E_{total} = 2(3000) + 4(1000) - 4$$\n$$E_{total} = 6000 + 4000 - 4$$\n$$E_{total} = 10000 - 4 = 9996$$\nBoth methods yield the same result. The total number of high-energy phosphate equivalents consumed is $9996$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9996}$$", "id": "2842316"}, {"introduction": "Gene expression is not a constant, unregulated process; cells must adapt to changing environmental conditions.

The description of transcription, splicing, EJC deposition, the pioneer round of translation, and the general framework of NMD are all consistent with established principles of molecular biology. The numerical values provided—EJC deposition at $20$–$24$ nt upstream of a junction, a PTC at $60$ nt upstream, and the invocation of the \"$50$–$55$ nt rule\"—are canonical and factually correct representations of the NMD mechanism. The problem is well-posed, self-contained, and provides sufficient information to deduce a unique outcome based on the standard model of NMD. The language is precise and objective.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe central question is whether an mRNA with a premature termination codon (PTC) located $60$ nucleotides upstream of the final exon-exon junction will be targeted for degradation by the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway. The analysis must proceed from the fundamental principles of post-transcriptional gene regulation.\n\n1.  **Splicing and EJC Deposition**: During splicing in the nucleus, introns are removed and exons are ligated. Concurrently, a multi-protein complex known as the exon junction complex (EJC) is deposited on the mRNA sequence, typically $20$ to $24$ nucleotides upstream of the newly formed exon-exon junction. These EJCs serve as markers of the splicing history of the mRNA.\n\n2.  **mRNA Export and Pioneer Translation**: The mature mRNA, along with its associated EJCs, is exported to the cytoplasm. The first round of translation by a ribosome is termed the \"pioneer round.\" As the ribosome translocates along the mRNA, it displaces and removes the EJCs it encounters.\n\n3.  **NMD Surveillance**: NMD is a quality control mechanism that identifies and degrades mRNAs containing PTCs. The canonical trigger for NMD in vertebrates is the detection of an EJC downstream of a terminating ribosome. Normal termination codons (TCs) are typically located in the last exon, downstream of the final exon-exon junction. Consequently, no EJCs are present downstream of a normal TC, and the mRNA is stable. A PTC, by definition, occurs upstream of the normal TC. If a PTC's position allows a ribosome to terminate while at least one EJC remains on the mRNA downstream, this configuration is recognized as aberrant.\n\n4.  **The \"$50$–$55$ nt Rule\"**: This empirical rule provides a quantitative criterion for NMD activation. It states that a termination codon located more than $50$ to $55$ nt a)upstream of an exon-exon junction will trigger NMD. A termination codon located within this $50$–$55$ nt region will not. The mechanistic basis for this rule relates to the physical size, or \"footprint,\" of the terminating ribosome. When a ribosome terminates, it does not immediately dissociate but occupies a segment of the mRNA. If the stop codon is too close to the downstream EJC (i.e., within the $50$–$55$ nt boundary from the junction), the terminating ribosome's footprint sterically displaces the EJC. If the stop codon is sufficiently far upstream (i.e., > $50$–$55$ nt), the ribosome terminates and dissociates without disturbing the downstream EJC.\n\n5.  **Application to the Problem**:\n    - The PTC is located $60$ nt upstream of the last exon-exon junction.\n    - The distance $d = 60$ nt.\n    - The critical distance for the \"$50$–$55$ nt rule\" is $d_{crit} \\approx 50-55$ nt.\n    - Since $d > d_{crit}$ ($60 \\text{ nt} > 55 \\text{ nt}$), the condition for NMD activation is met.\n    - **Mechanism**: The ribosome will translate the mRNA and encounter the PTC. Upon termination, the ribosome will be positioned sufficiently far from the downstream EJC (which is located $20$–$24$ nt upstream of the junction) so that it does not displace it. The presence of this surviving EJC downstream of the stalled ribosome recruits a set of proteins central to NMD, known as the Up-Frameshift (UPF) factors. Specifically, UPF3B is a core component of the EJC, which then recruits UPF2. Meanwhile, the terminating ribosome recruits UPF1. The interaction between UPF1 at the PTC and the UPF2/UPF3B complex at the EJC forms a surveillance complex that signals for the mRNA to be degraded.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. NMD will be triggered during the pioneer round of translation in the cytoplasm because the PTC lies more than $50$–$55$ nt upstream of the last exon–exon junction, ensuring at least one downstream EJC remains to recruit Up-Frameshift proteins (UPF1/UPF2/UPF3) and license decay.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with the derivation. The PTC at $60$ nt upstream satisfies the >$50$–$55$ nt rule. The mechanistic consequence is the persistence of the downstream EJC. This EJC, in concert with the terminated ribosome, recruits the UPF proteins to form the complex that triggers decay.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. NMD will not be triggered because EJCs are removed during nuclear splicing, so no downstream EJC can be present when the ribosome terminates at the PTC.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. EJCs are deposited, not removed, during splicing. They are transported to the cytoplasm with the mRNA and removed by the translating ribosome. The premise of the argument is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. NMD will not be triggered because a ribosome terminating at a PTC $60$ nt upstream of the last junction will displace the downstream EJC with its termination footprint, preventing formation of the surveillance complex.**\nThis statement directly contradicts the mechanistic interpretation of the \"$50$–$55$ nt rule.\" A distance of $60$ nt is greater than the critical threshold, and is thus predicted to be *too far* for the ribosome to displace the EJC. This option claims the opposite, suggesting displacement will occur, which is incorrect according to the standard model invoked by the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. NMD requires at least two downstream EJCs to be engaged; with only one exon–exon junction downstream of the PTC, decay will not occur.**\nThis premise is false. The canonical NMD model requires only *one* downstream EJC to trigger decay. The \"$50$–$55$ nt rule\" is defined relative to a single junction (the last one, when applicable), reinforcing that a single EJC is sufficient.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. NMD outcome depends exclusively on poly(A) tail length via poly(A)-binding protein; sufficiently long tails universally prevent decay irrespective of PTC–junction geometry.**\nThis statement is a gross oversimplification and is factually incorrect. While interactions involving the poly(A) tail and Poly(A)-Binding Protein (PABP) are important for normal translation termination and can modulate NMD efficiency, they do not act \"exclusively\" or \"irrespective\" of the PTC-EJC context. The primary signal for NMD is the presence of a downstream EJC. The claim that PTC-junction geometry is irrelevant is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2842262"}]}
