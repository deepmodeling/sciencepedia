The probability of such a gamete is $P(\\text{gamete}=A | \\text{parent}=AA) = 1$.\nThe parent with genotype $aa$ is true-breeding and can only produce gametes containing the $a$ allele. The probability of such a gamete is $P(\\text{gamete}=a | \\text{parent}=aa) = 1$.\nFertilization involves the random union of one gamete from each parent. Therefore, any offspring in the $F_1$ generation must receive an $A$ allele from the $AA$ parent and an $a$ allele from the $aa$ parent.\nThe resulting genotype of every $F_1$ individual is therefore $Aa$.\nThe probability distribution for the $F_1$ genotypes is:\n$P(AA)_{F_1} = 0$\n$P(Aa)_{F_1} = 1$\n$P(aa)_{F_1} = 0$\n\nDerivation of $F_2$ Generation Genotypes:\nThe $F_2$ generation is produced by intercrossing individuals from the $F_1$ generation. The cross is $Aa \\times Aa$.\nAccording to the law of segregation, each heterozygous $Aa$ parent produces two types of gametes, $A$ and $a$, with equal probability.\nFor any parent with genotype $Aa$:\n$P(\\text{gamete}=A) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$P(\\text{gamete}=a) = \\frac{1}{2}$\nThe genotype of an $F_2$ offspring is determined by the random union of one gamete from each of the two $F_1$ parents. As the fertilization is random, the probability of a specific offspring genotype is the product of the probabilities of the constituent gametes.\nThe probability of an $F_2$ offspring having the genotype $AA$ is the probability that it receives an $A$ gamete from both parents:\n$P(AA)_{F_2} = P(\\text{gamete}=A) \\times P(\\text{gamete}=A) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\nThe probability of an $F_2$ offspring having the genotype $aa$ is the probability that it receives an $a$ gamete from both parents:\n$P(aa)_{F_2} = P(\\text{gamete}=a) \\times P(\\text{gamete}=a) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\nThe probability of an $F_2$ offspring having the genotype $Aa$ can occur in two mutually exclusive ways: receiving $A$ from the first parent and $a$ from the second, or receiving $a$ from the first parent and $A$ from the second.\n$P(Aa)_{F_2} = [P(\\text{gamete}=A) \\times P(\\text{gamete}=a)] + [P(\\text{gamete}=a) \\times P(\\text{gamete}=A)]$\n$P(Aa)_{F_2} = (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$\nThe sum of probabilities is $P(AA)_{F_2} + P(Aa)_{F_2} + P(aa)_{F_2} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$, as required.\nThe genotype distribution in the $F_2$ generation is: $P(AA)_{F_2} = \\frac{1}{4}$, $P(Aa)_{F_2} = \\frac{1}{2}$, $P(aa)_{F_2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nDerivation of $F_2$ Generation Phenotypes:\nThe problem states complete dominance of allele $A$ over $a$.

A rigorous derivation of the solution will now be presented.\n\nThe derivation must proceed from the first principles specified.\n\nFirst, consider a single locus, for instance, the gene with alleles $A$ and $a$. The parents are both heterozygous with genotype $Aa$. According to Mendel's law of segregation, each parent produces gametes containing either the allele $A$ or the allele $a$ with equal probability.\nLet $P(A)$ be the probability of a gamete receiving allele $A$, and $P(a)$ be the probability of receiving allele $a$.\n$$ P(A) = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n$$ P(a) = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe cross is $Aa \\times Aa$. The genotypes of the offspring ($F_2$ generation for this locus) are determined by the random fusion of gametes.

This means that the phenotype for one locus is inherited independently of the phenotypes for the other loci.

Let $D$ denote the dominant phenotype and $R$ denote the recessive phenotype.
