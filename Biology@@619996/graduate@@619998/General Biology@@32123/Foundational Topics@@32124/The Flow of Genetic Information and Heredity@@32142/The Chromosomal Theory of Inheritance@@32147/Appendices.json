It describes a canonical 2-point testcross, a fundamental experimental design in classical genetics used to measure linkage. The data provided ($n$ and $x$) are sufficient and consistent for the requested statistical estimation. The problem is formalizable using the principles of meiotic recombination and binomial probability theory. The request to derive the estimator from first principles elevates the problem beyond trivial formula application. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will now be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) for the recombination fraction, $r$, from first principles, followed by a calculation of the genetic map distance.\n\n1. Derivation and Calculation of the Recombination Fraction, $r$\n\nA testcross involves crossing a heterozygous individual ($A B / a b$) to a homozygous recessive individual ($a b / a b$). The phenotype of the progeny is determined solely by the gamete contributed by the heterozygous parent, as the recessive parent only contributes the $ab$ haplotype, which does not mask the alleles from the other gamete.\n\nLet $r$ be the recombination fraction, which is the probability that a random gamete from the heterozygous parent is a recombinant type (either $A b$ or $a B$). Consequently, the probability that a random gamete is a parental, non-recombinant type (either $A B$ or $a b$) is $1-r$.\n\nIn a sample of $n$ progeny, each observation is an independent Bernoulli trial, where the outcome is either \"recombinant\" with probability $r$ or \"non-recombinant\" with probability $1-r$. The number of recombinant progeny, $x$, in a total of $n$ progeny therefore follows a binomial distribution. The probability of observing exactly $x$ recombinants in $n$ trials is given by the probability mass function:\n$$P(X=x | n, r) = \\binom{n}{x} r^{x} (1-r)^{n-x}$$\n\nThe likelihood function, $L(r)$, is this probability viewed as a function of the parameter $r$ for the observed data ($x$ and $n$):\n$$L(r; x, n) = \\binom{n}{x} r^{x} (1-r)^{n-x}$$\n\nTo find the value of $r$ that maximizes this function, we can equivalently maximize the natural logarithm of the likelihood function, the log-likelihood $\\ell(r) = \\ln(L(r))$, as the logarithm is a strictly increasing function.\n$$\\ell(r) = \\ln\\left(\\binom{n}{x}\\right) + x \\ln(r) + (n-x) \\ln(1-r)$$\n\nThe maximum-likelihood estimate, $\\hat{r}$, is found by taking the derivative of $\\ell(r)$ with respect to $r$ and setting it to zero. The term $\\ln(\\binom{n}{x})$ is a constant with respect to $r$ and its derivative is zero.\n$$\\frac{d\\ell}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ x \\ln(r) + (n-x) \\ln(1-r) \\right] = \\frac{x}{r} - \\frac{n-x}{1-r}$$\n\nSetting the derivative to zero to find the critical point:\n$$\\frac{x}{\\hat{r}} - \\frac{n-x}{1-\\hat{r}} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{x}{\\hat{r}} = \\frac{n-x}{1-\\hat{r}}$$\n$$x(1-\\hat{r}) = \\hat{r}(n-x)$$\n$$x - x\\hat{r} = n\\hat{r} - x\\hat{r}$$\n$$x = n\\hat{r}$$\nThis yields the maximum-likelihood estimator for $r$:\n$$\\hat{r} = \\frac{x}{n}$$\nThis derivation confirms from first principles that the MLE for the recombination fraction is the observed proportion of recombinant individuals.\n\nUsing the provided data, $x = 180$ and $n = 1000$:\n$$\\hat{r} = \\frac{180}{1000} = 0.18$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $\\hat{r} = 0.180$.\n\n2. Calculation of Genetic Map Distance\n\nThe genetic map distance in centimorgans (cM) is defined as the mean number of crossovers between two loci per meiosis, multiplied by $100$. For short genetic intervals, the probability of double (or any even number) crossovers is negligible. A single crossover event between two loci always produces recombinant gametes. Therefore, for short distances, the recombination fraction $r$ is a direct and linear estimate of the map distance. The relationship is given by:\n$$\\text{Map Distance (cM)} = 100 \\times r$$\nThis approximation is generally considered valid for $r \\lesssim 0.2$. Since our estimated $\\hat{r} = 0.180$, this linear conversion is appropriate under the problem's specified \"conventional short-interval interpretation\".\n\nUsing our estimated value of $\\hat{r}$:\n$$\\text{Map Distance (cM)} = 100 \\times 0.180 = 18.0$$\nThe map distance is $18.0$ cM.\n\n3. Required Assumptions\n\nConverting an empirically measured recombination fraction, $\\hat{r}$, from a 2-point cross into a linear map distance requires several critical assumptions.\n\nBiological assumptions:\n- **No Crossover Interference**: The primary assumption for the linear relationship, distance (cM) $= 100 \\times r$, is that crossover events occur independently. That is, the occurrence of one crossover does not influence the probability of a second crossover in the same region. This condition is formally known as the absence of interference. For distances greater than approximately $15-20$ cM, positive interference becomes significant, causing $r$ to underestimate the true map distance calculated from crossover frequency. Mapping functions (e.g., Haldane's or Kosambi's) are required to correct for this non-linearity at larger distances.\n- **Uniform Recombination Rate**: The conversion assumes that the probability of a crossover is uniform per unit of physical distance along the chromosome segment between the two markers. In reality, recombination rates vary, with regions of high activity (hotspots) and low activity (coldspots). The resulting map distance is thus a genetic average, not a precise physical representation.\n- **Equal Viability**: It is assumed that all genotypic classes of progeny (parental and recombinant) are equally viable and detectable at the time of scoring. If recombinant genotypes have reduced viability, the observed frequency $x/n$ will be an underestimate of the true meiotic recombination fraction $r$, leading to an underestimated map distance.\n\nStatistical assumptions:\n- **Large and Random Sample**: The estimate $\\hat{r} = x/n$ relies on the Law of Large Numbers. The sample of progeny is assumed to be large enough for the observed frequency to be a precise estimate of the true population parameter $r$. The sample must also be a random representation of the products of meiosis. With $n=1000$, the sample size is more than adequate for this purpose.\n- **Problem Context Specific Assumption**: The problem specifies a dipteran species and a cross with a heterozygous female. In some dipterans, such as *Drosophila melanogaster*, meiotic recombination is absent in males. The cross design ($AB/ab$ female $\\times$ $ab/ab$ male) correctly isolates recombination events from the female parent, providing a direct measurement of the female-specific recombination rate. The derived map distance is therefore a female genetic map distance, which may differ from the male-specific or sex-averaged map distance if recombination rates are sexually dimorphic.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0.180 & 18.0 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2842661"}, {"introduction": "While linkage is a property of meiosis in individuals, its effects leave a distinct signature at the population level known as linkage disequilibrium (LD)—the non-random association of alleles at different loci.

Do not include units in your answer.", "solution": "The problem statement has been critically examined and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of population genetics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively formulated. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the definition of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the computation of three standard measures of it: the LD coefficient $D$, the normalized coefficient $D'$, and the squared correlation $r^2$.\n\nFirst, we define linkage disequilibrium. LD is the non-random association of alleles at different loci within a population. If alleles at two loci were assorted independently, the frequency of any given haplotype would be the product of the marginal frequencies of its constituent alleles. Linkage disequilibrium quantifies the deviation from this expectation. For two biallelic loci with alleles $A, a$ and $B, b$, the LD coefficient, $D$, is defined as:\n$$D = f_{AB} - p_A p_B$$\nwhere $f_{AB}$ is the observed frequency of the haplotype $AB$, and $p_A$ and $p_B$ are the marginal frequencies of alleles $A$ and $B$, respectively. Alternatively, $D$ can be calculated from the four haplotype frequencies as the difference in the frequencies of coupling and repulsion gametes:\n$$D = f_{AB}f_{ab} - f_{Ab}f_{aB}$$\n\nThe provided haplotype frequencies are:\n$f_{AB} = 0.41$\n$f_{Ab} = 0.09$\n$f_{aB} = 0.10$\n$f_{ab} = 0.40$\nThe sum is $0.41 + 0.09 + 0.10 + 0.40 = 1.00$, which is consistent.\n\nThe first step in the calculation is to determine the marginal allele frequencies from the given haplotype frequencies.\nThe frequency of allele $A$, denoted $p_A$, is the sum of the frequencies of haplotypes containing $A$:\n$$p_A = f_{AB} + f_{Ab} = 0.41 + 0.09 = 0.50$$\nThe frequency of allele $a$, denoted $p_a$, is:\n$$p_a = f_{aB} + f_{ab} = 0.10 + 0.40 = 0.50$$\nAs a check, $p_A + p_a = 0.50 + 0.50 = 1.00$.\n\nSimilarly, for the second locus:\nThe frequency of allele $B$, denoted $p_B$, is:\n$$p_B = f_{AB} + f_{aB} = 0.41 + 0.10 = 0.51$$\nThe frequency of allele $b$, denoted $p_b$, is:\n$$p_b = f_{Ab} + f_{ab} = 0.09 + 0.40 = 0.49$$\nAs a check, $p_B + p_b = 0.51 + 0.49 = 1.00$.\n\nNow, we compute the LD coefficient, $D$. Using the cross-product formula is most direct:\n$$D = f_{AB}f_{ab} - f_{Ab}f_{aB} = (0.41)(0.40) - (0.09)(0.10) = 0.164 - 0.009 = 0.155$$\nTo express this as an exact fraction:\n$$D = \\frac{155}{1000} = \\frac{31}{200}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the normalized disequilibrium, $D'$. This is defined as $D' = D/D_{max}$, where $D_{max}$ is the theoretical maximum (or minimum, in magnitude) value $D$ could take given the observed allele frequencies.\nSince our calculated $D = 0.155$ is positive, $D_{max}$ is given by:\n$$D_{max} = \\min(p_A p_b, p_a p_B)$$\nUsing the calculated allele frequencies:\n$p_A p_b = (0.50)(0.49) = 0.245$\n$p_a p_B = (0.50)(0.51) = 0.255$\nThus, $D_{max} = \\min(0.245, 0.255) = 0.245$.\nNow we compute $D'$:\n$$D' = \\frac{D}{D_{max}} = \\frac{0.155}{0.245}$$\nAs an exact fraction:\n$$D' = \\frac{155}{245} = \\frac{31 \\times 5}{49 \\times 5} = \\frac{31}{49}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the squared correlation of alleles, $r^2$. The formula for $r^2$ is:\n$$r^2 = \\frac{D^2}{p_A p_a p_B p_b}$$\nWe will use the exact fractional forms for precision.\n$D = \\frac{31}{200}$\n$p_A = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$p_a = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$p_B = \\frac{51}{100}$\n$p_b = \\frac{49}{100}$\nThe numerator is $D^2$:\n$$D^2 = \\left(\\frac{31}{200}\\right)^2 = \\frac{31^2}{200^2} = \\frac{961}{40000}$$\nThe denominator is the product of allele frequency variances:\n$$p_A p_a p_B p_b = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{51}{100}\\right)\\left(\\frac{49}{100}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{51 \\times 49}{10000} = \\frac{2499}{40000}$$\nNow, we can compute $r^2$:\n$$r^2 = \\frac{\\frac{961}{40000}}{\\frac{2499}{40000}} = \\frac{961}{2499}$$\nThe numerator is $961 = 31^2$.
