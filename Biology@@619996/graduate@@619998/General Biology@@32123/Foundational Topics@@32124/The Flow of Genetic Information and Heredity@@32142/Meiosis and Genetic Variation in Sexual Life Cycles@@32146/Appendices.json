{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A deep understanding of meiosis requires not only knowing the steps of a normal division but also being able to predict the consequences when things go wrong. This practice challenges you to work from first principles to distinguish between nondisjunction events occurring in Meiosis I versus Meiosis II, which are the two major stages of chromosome segregation. By designing a genetic cross with centromere-linked markers, you will derive the expected phenotypic ratios of viable spores for each error type, revealing the distinct genetic signatures they leave behind [@problem_id:2814284].", "problem": "A geneticist working with the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae wants to distinguish meiosis I nondisjunction from meiosis II nondisjunction for a single chromosome using centromere-linked markers and to compute the expected segregation ratios of marker phenotypes under each error mode among viable products.\n\nDesign the following cross and analysis. Construct a diploid by mating two haploid strains that differ in dominant, neutral, phenotypically scorable markers that are each tightly linked (effectively recombination fraction $r = 0$) to the centromere of the same chromosome, denoted chromosome $C$:\n- Haploid strain $X$: carries marker $A$ linked to the centromere of chromosome $C$ and is otherwise wild type (no $B$).\n- Haploid strain $Y$: carries marker $B$ linked to the centromere of chromosome $C$ and is otherwise wild type (no $A$).\n\nThe resulting diploid is heterozygous and centromere-coupled in repulsion on chromosome $C$ ($A/-$ on one homolog and $-/B$ on the other). Upon sporulation, only nondisjunction affecting chromosome $C$ is considered. Nullisomic spores for chromosome $C$ are inviable with probability $1$. Disomic spores for chromosome $C$ survive with probability $p_d$, where $0 < p_d \\leq 1$. Euploid haploid spores survive with probability $1$.

It represents a classic problem in transmission genetics for distinguishing meiotic errors using linked markers. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided, and there are no contradictions. The problem is valid for analysis. We proceed from first principles.\n\nThe initial diploid cell is heterozygous for markers $A$ and $B$ on chromosome $C$. Let the homolog carrying marker $A$ be denoted $C_A$ and the homolog carrying marker $B$ be denoted $C_B$. Since the markers are tightly linked to the centromere, the recombination fraction is $r=0$. Before meiosis begins, DNA replication occurs. The cell then contains one replicated chromosome $C_A$, which consists of two sister chromatids that are both $A$, and one replicated chromosome $C_B$, which consists of two sister chromatids that are both $B$.\n\nWe analyze the two cases of nondisjunction separately.\n\nCase 1: Meiosis I Nondisjunction of Chromosome $C$\nBy definition, nondisjunction in meiosis I is the failure of homologous chromosomes to segregate. In this case, both the replicated $C_A$ and the replicated $C_B$ move to the same pole during anaphase I. The other pole receives no chromosome $C$.\n\nThis results in two secondary meiocytes:\n1.  One disomic secondary meiocyte, containing both replicated $C_A$ and $C_B$. Its chromosome $C$ genetic content is effectively A/B.\n2.  One nullisomic secondary meiocyte, containing no chromosome $C$.\n\nMeiosis II then proceeds.\n- The disomic secondary meiocyte undergoes a normal segregation of sister chromatids. The two sister chromatids of $C_A$ separate, and the two sister chromatids of $C_B$ separate. This division produces two spores, each receiving one chromatid from $C_A$ and one from $C_B$. These two spores are therefore disomic with genotype A/B.\n- The nullisomic secondary meiocyte also divides, producing two spores that are nullisomic for chromosome $C$.\n\nIn summary, a single meiosis I nondisjunction event produces a tetrad of four spores with the following genotypes for chromosome $C$: two spores of genotype A/B and two nullisomic spores.\n\nWe now apply the viability rules to determine the phenotypes of the surviving spores.\n- Spores with genotype A/B are disomic. They express both dominant markers, resulting in the A+B phenotype. Their survival probability is $p_d$.\n- Nullisomic spores are inviable, with a survival probability of $0$.\n\nFrom one meiotic event, the expected number of viable spores of each phenotype class is:\n- Expected viable A-only spores: $0$.\n- Expected viable B-only spores: $0$.\n- Expected viable A+B spores: $2 \\times p_d$.\n\nThe total expected number of viable spores is $0 + 0 + 2 p_d = 2 p_d$. The proportions of each phenotype among the viable progeny are calculated by dividing the expected number for each class by the total expected number of viable spores. This is valid for $p_d > 0$.\n- Proportion A-only: $\\frac{0}{2 p_d} = 0$\n- Proportion B-only: $\\frac{0}{2 p_d} = 0$\n- Proportion A+B: $\\frac{2 p_d}{2 p_d} = 1$\n\nThus, for meiosis I nondisjunction, all viable spores will exhibit the A+B phenotype.\n\nCase 2: Meiosis II Nondisjunction of Chromosome $C$\nMeiosis I proceeds normally. The homologous chromosomes $C_A$ and $C_B$ segregate to opposite poles. This produces two euploid secondary meiocytes: one containing the replicated chromosome $C_A$ and the other containing the replicated chromosome $C_B$.\n\nNondisjunction occurs during meiosis II. This is the failure of sister chromatids to separate in one of the secondary meiocytes. The problem states that this failure is equally likely to occur in the $C_A$-bearing cell or the $C_B$-bearing cell, each with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSubcase 2a: Nondisjunction in the $C_A$-bearing meiocyte (Probability $\\frac{1}{2}$).\n- The two sister chromatids of $C_A$ fail to separate, resulting in one disomic spore of genotype A/A (phenotype A-only) and one nullisomic spore.\n- The $C_B$-bearing meiocyte divides normally, producing two euploid spores of genotype B (phenotype B-only).\n- The four spores produced are: $1 \\times (\\text{A/A})$, $1 \\times (\\text{null})$, $2 \\times (\\text{B})$.\n\nSubcase 2b: Nondisjunction in the $C_B$-bearing meiocyte (Probability $\\frac{1}{2}$).\n- This is symmetric to the previous case. The two sister chromatids of $C_B$ fail to separate, yielding one disomic spore of genotype B/B (phenotype B-only) and one nullisomic spore.\n- The $C_A$-bearing meiocyte divides normally, producing two euploid spores of genotype A (phenotype A-only).\n- The four spores produced are: $1 \\times (\\text{B/B})$, $1 \\times (\\text{null})$, $2 \\times (\\text{A})$.\n\nTo find the overall proportions, we calculate the expected number of viable spores of each type per meiotic event, averaging over these two subcases. Viability rules are: euploid (A or B) survival is $1$; disomic (A/A or B/B) survival is $p_d$; nullisomic survival is $0$.\n\nExpected number of viable A-only spores:\n- From Subcase 2a (prob $\\frac{1}{2}$): $1$ disomic A/A spore with viability $p_d$. Contribution: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times p_d = \\frac{p_d}{2}$.\n- From Subcase 2b (prob $\\frac{1}{2}$): $2$ euploid A spores with viability $1$. Contribution: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 1 = 1$.\n- Total expected viable A-only spores: $1 + \\frac{p_d}{2}$.\n\nExpected number of viable B-only spores:\n- From Subcase 2a (prob $\\frac{1}{2}$): $2$ euploid B spores with viability $1$. Contribution: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 1 = 1$.\n- From Subcase 2b (prob $\\frac{1}{2}$): $1$ disomic B/B spore with viability $p_d$. Contribution: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times p_d = \\frac{p_d}{2}$.\n- Total expected viable B-only spores: $1 + \\frac{p_d}{2}$.\n\nExpected number of viable A+B spores: $0$.\n\nThe total expected number of viable spores per meiosis II nondisjunction event is the sum of the above:\nTotal = $(1 + \\frac{p_d}{2}) + (1 + \\frac{p_d}{2}) + 0 = 2 + p_d$.\n\nThe proportions of each phenotype among the viable progeny are:\n- Proportion A-only: $\\frac{1 + \\frac{p_d}{2}}{2 + p_d} = \\frac{\\frac{2+p_d}{2}}{2+p_d} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Proportion B-only: $\\frac{1 + \\frac{p_d}{2}}{2 + p_d} = \\frac{\\frac{2+p_d}{2}}{2+p_d} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Proportion A+B: $\\frac{0}{2+p_d} = 0$.\n\nNotice that for meiosis II nondisjunction, the proportions of A-only and B-only phenotypes are equal and independent of the disomic survival probability $p_d$. This is due to the symmetry of the experimental design.\n\nFinal compilation of results in the specified $1 \\times 6$ matrix format:\n- MI: A-only: $0$\n- MI: B-only: $0$\n- MI: A+B: $1$\n- MII: A-only: $\\frac{1}{2}$\n- MII: B-only: $\\frac{1}{2}$\n- MII: A+B: $0$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 1 & \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2814284"}, {"introduction": "While recombination generates genetic diversity, the placement of crossovers along a chromosome is not random.

All necessary data and constraints for deriving the requested index are provided. The supplementary data on noncrossovers is consistent with the primary data and the stated assumptions, confirming the problem's internal consistency. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe task is to derive a dimensionless scalar index $H$ that quantifies crossover homeostasis. The index must satisfy three properties, which we will use to construct its mathematical form. The index must depend only on the mean Double-Strand Break (DSB) counts ($D_{\\text{wt}}$, $D_{\\text{mut}}$) and the mean crossover (CO) counts ($C_{\\text{wt}}$, $C_{\\text{mut}}$) for the wild-type (wt) and mutant (mut) genotypes.\n\nLet us first define the scenarios corresponding to the boundary conditions for $H$.\n\nProperty 1 defines the case of zero homeostasis ($H=0$). It states that for $H=0$, \"the mean number of crossovers in the mutant scales strictly in proportion to the reduction in DSBs relative to wild type\". This implies that the probability of a given DSB becoming a crossover is the same in the mutant as in the wild type. In the wild type, this per-DSB probability of forming a crossover, $P_{\\text{CO, wt}}$, can be estimated as the ratio of mean crossovers to mean DSBs:\n$$P_{\\text{CO, wt}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{wt}}}{D_{\\text{wt}}}$$\nUnder the no-homeostasis condition, the expected number of crossovers in the mutant, which we denote $C_{\\text{no homeo}}$, would be the total number of DSBs in the mutant, $D_{\\text{mut}}$, multiplied by this constant probability:\n$$C_{\\text{no homeo}} = D_{\\text{mut}} \\times P_{\\text{CO, wt}} = D_{\\text{mut}} \\frac{C_{\\text{wt}}}{D_{\\text{wt}}}$$\nThus, the condition for $H=0$ is that the observed mutant crossover count, $C_{\\text{mut}}$, equals $C_{\\text{no homeo}}$.\n\nProperty 2 defines the case of perfect homeostasis ($H=1$). It states that for $H=1$, \"the mean number of crossovers in the mutant is perfectly buffered and equals the wild-type mean\". This means that despite the reduction in initiating DSBs, the final number of crossovers is maintained. The expected number of crossovers in the mutant under this full homeostasis scenario, denoted $C_{\\text{full homeo}}$, is therefore:\n$$C_{\\text{full homeo}} = C_{\\text{wt}}$$\nThe condition for $H=1$ is that the observed mutant crossover count, $C_{\\text{mut}}$, equals $C_{\\text{full homeo}}$.\n\nWe now have three relevant quantities for the number of crossovers in the mutant:\n1. The observed number, $C_{\\text{mut}}$.\n2. The expected number with no homeostasis, $C_{\\text{no homeo}}$.\n3. The expected number with full homeostasis, $C_{\\text{full homeo}}$.\n\nThe index $H$ should quantify where the observed value $C_{\\text{mut}}$ lies on the spectrum from no homeostasis to full homeostasis. A logical way to construct such a normalized index is to consider the deviation of the observed value from the no-homeostasis baseline and normalize it by the maximum possible deviation, which corresponds to full homeostasis.\n\nThe \"homeostatic response\" is the extent to which the observed crossover count exceeds the no-homeostasis expectation:\n$$\\text{Response} = C_{\\text{mut}} - C_{\\text{no homeo}}$$\nThe \"maximum possible homeostatic response\" is the difference between the crossover count under full homeostasis and the count under no homeostasis:\n$$\\text{Maximum Response} = C_{\\text{full homeo}} - C_{\\text{no homeo}}$$\nThe index $H$ is the ratio of the actual response to the maximum possible response:\n$$H = \\frac{\\text{Response}}{\\text{Maximum Response}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{mut}} - C_{\\text{no homeo}}}{C_{\\text{full homeo}} - C_{\\text{no homeo}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $C_{\\text{no homeo}}$ and $C_{\\text{full homeo}}$:\n$$H = \\frac{C_{\\text{mut}} - C_{\\text{wt}}\\frac{D_{\\text{mut}}}{D_{\\text{wt}}}}{C_{\\text{wt}} - C_{\\text{wt}}\\frac{D_{\\text{mut}}}{D_{\\text{wt}}}}$$\nThis form satisfies property 3, as it depends only on $D_{\\text{wt}}$, $D_{\\text{mut}}$, $C_{\\text{wt}}$, and $C_{\\text{mut}}$. If $C_{\\text{mut}} = C_{\\text{no homeo}}$, the numerator is zero, so $H=0$. If $C_{\\text{mut}} = C_{\\text{full homeo}}$, the numerator and denominator are equal, so $H=1$. The derivation is thus consistent with all specified properties.\n\nWe can simplify the symbolic expression for $H$ by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $D_{\\text{wt}}$:\n$$H = \\frac{D_{\\text{wt}} \\left( C_{\\text{mut}} - C_{\\text{wt}}\\frac{D_{\\text{mut}}}{D_{\\text{wt}}} \\right)}{D_{\\text{wt}} \\left( C_{\\text{wt}} - C_{\\text{wt}}\\frac{D_{\\text{mut}}}{D_{\\text{wt}}} \\right)} = \\frac{C_{\\text{mut}}D_{\\text{wt}} - C_{\\text{wt}}D_{\\text{mut}}}{C_{\\text{wt}}D_{\\text{wt}} - C_{\\text{wt}}D_{\\text{mut}}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{mut}}D_{\\text{wt}} - C_{\\text{wt}}D_{\\text{mut}}}{C_{\\text{wt}}(D_{\\text{wt}} - D_{\\text{mut}})}$$\nThis is the final symbolic expression for the homeostasis index $H$.\n\nNow, we evaluate $H$ using the provided data:\n$D_{\\text{wt}} = 240$\n$D_{\\text{mut}} = 144$\n$C_{\\text{wt}} = 72$\n$C_{\\text{mut}} = 64$\n\nFirst, let's calculate the values for the numerator and denominator:\nNumerator:\n$$C_{\\text{mut}}D_{\\text{wt}} - C_{\\text{wt}}D_{\\text{mut}} = (64)(240) - (72)(144) = 15360 - 10368 = 4992$$\nDenominator:\n$$C_{\\text{wt}}(D_{\\text{wt}} - D_{\\text{mut}}) = 72(240 - 144) = 72(96) = 6912$$\nNow, we compute the ratio:\n$$H = \\frac{4992}{6912}$$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can find common divisors. Both are divisible by $8$:\n$$H = \\frac{4992 \\div 8}{6912 \\div 8} = \\frac{624}{864}$$\nBoth are divisible by $8$ again:\n$$H = \\frac{624 \\div 8}{864 \\div 8} = \\frac{78}{108}$$\nBoth are divisible by $6$:\n$$H = \\frac{78 \\div 6}{108 \\div 6} = \\frac{13}{18}$$\nThe exact value of $H$ is $\\frac{13}{18}$.
