A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis proceeds from the definitions provided. Let the genotypic values for the genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ be denoted by $G_{AA}$, $G_{Aa}$, and $G_{aa}$, respectively. The given values are $G_{AA}=10$, $G_{Aa}=8$, and $G_{aa}=4$.\n\nThe core of the model is the definition of a reference point on the scale of trait measurement. This reference is the midpoint, $M$, between the genotypic values of the two homozygotes, $G_{AA}$ and $G_{aa}$. Its definition is:\n$$M = \\frac{G_{AA} + G_{aa}}{2}$$\n\nThe additive effect, $a$, is defined as the half-distance between the homozygote values. This means the genotypic values of the homozygotes can be represented symmetrically around the midpoint $M$. Let us assign the higher-valued homozygote, $G_{AA}$, to be at a distance $+a$ from $M$, and the lower-valued homozygote, $G_{aa}$, to be at a distance $-a$ from $M$. This is consistent with the sign convention given.\n$$G_{AA} = M + a$$\n$$G_{aa} = M - a$$\nTo derive an expression for $a$ in terms of the genotypic values, we can subtract the second equation from the first:\n$$G_{AA} - G_{aa} = (M + a) - (M - a) = 2a$$\nSolving for $a$ yields the desired expression:\n$$a = \\frac{G_{AA} - G_{aa}}{2}$$\n\nThe dominance deviation, $d$, is defined as the deviation of the heterozygote's genotypic value, $G_{Aa}$, from the same midpoint, $M$.\n$$d = G_{Aa} - M$$\nSubstituting the expression for $M$:\n$$d = G_{Aa} - \\frac{G_{AA} + G_{aa}}{2}$$\nThis completes the derivation of the expressions for $a$ and $d$ purely in terms of the observed genotypic means.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values for these parameters using the provided data: $G_{AA}=10$, $G_{Aa}=8$, and $G_{aa}=4$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the midpoint $M$:\n$$M = \\frac{10 + 4}{2} = \\frac{14}{2} = 7$$\n\nNext, we calculate the additive effect $a$:\n$$a = \\frac{10 - 4}{2} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3$$\nThe units for $a$ are trait units. The sign is positive, as required, because the higher-valued homozygote ($G_{AA}=10$) is above the midpoint ($M=7$).\n\nThen, we calculate the dominance deviation $d$:\n$$d = G_{Aa} - M = 8 - 7 = 1$$\nThe units for $d$ are also trait units.\n\nFinally, we compute the phenotypic dominance coefficient, $h$, which is defined as the ratio of the dominance deviation to the additive effect:\n$$h = \\frac{d}{a}$$\nSubstituting the computed values for $d$ and $a$:\n$$h = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThis coefficient is a dimensionless quantity that describes the degree of dominance. A value of $h=0$ indicates no dominance (additivity), $h=1$ indicates complete dominance of allele $A$, and $h=-1$ indicates complete dominance of allele $a$. Here, $h=1/3$ signifies partial dominance of the allele $A$ (the allele associated with the higher phenotypic value).\n\nThe required result is the ordered triple $(a, d, h)$.\nThe calculated values are $a=3$, $d=1$, and $h=1/3$.\nTherefore, the ordered triple is $(3, 1, 1/3)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left(3, 1, \\frac{1}{3}\\right)}$$", "id": "2773485"}, {"introduction": "Quantitative parameters like the dominance deviation are not mere abstractions; they are the net result of molecular and cellular processes.

It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe task is to compute the dominance coefficient, $h$. This requires determining the phenotype of the heterozygote, $f_{Aa}$, which is the fraction of active enzymes in an $Aa$ individual.\n\nLet us first derive a general expression for the fraction of active tetramers as a function of $p$, the probability that a randomly chosen subunit is wild-type. A tetramer consists of $4$ subunits. The assembly process is described as random selection from a large pool, which means the selection of each of the $4$ subunits can be treated as an independent event.\n\nFor a tetramer to be active, all $4$ of its constituent subunits must be wild-type. The probability of selecting one wild-type subunit is $p$. Since the selections are independent, the probability of selecting $4$ consecutive wild-type subunits is the product of their individual probabilities.\nLet $F_{active}$ be the fraction of active tetramers.\n$$F_{active}(p) = p \\times p \\times p \\times p = p^{4}$$\nThis corresponds to the term for $k=4$ successful trials in a binomial distribution with $n=4$ trials, where a \"success\" is the selection of a wild-type subunit: $\\binom{4}{4}p^{4}(1-p)^{4-4} = p^{4}$.\n\nNext, we must determine the value of $p$ for each of the three genotypes: $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$. The problem states that the two alleles are transcribed and translated equally. This implies that the composition of the subunit pool directly reflects the allelic ratio in the genotype.\n- For genotype $AA$: Both alleles are $A$. Therefore, only wild-type subunits are produced. The pool of subunits consists of $100\\%$ wild-type subunits. The probability of choosing a wild-type subunit is $p_{AA} = 1$.\n- For genotype $aa$: Both alleles are $a$. Therefore, only mutant subunits are produced. The pool consists of $0\\%$ wild-type subunits. The probability of choosing a wild-type subunit is $p_{aa} = 0$.\n- For genotype $Aa$: One allele is $A$ and one is $a$. With equal expression, the pool of subunits will be composed of $50\\%$ wild-type and $50\\%$ mutant subunits. The probability of choosing a wild-type subunit is $p_{Aa} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nNow, we can compute the phenotype, $f$, for each genotype using the expression $F_{active} = p^{4}$. The phenotype $f$ is defined as the fraction of active enzyme.\n- For genotype $AA$: $f_{AA} = (p_{AA})^{4} = 1^{4} = 1$. This is consistent with the problem's given scaling.\n- For genotype $aa$: $f_{aa} = (p_{aa})^{4} = 0^{4} = 0$. This is also consistent with the given scaling.\n- For genotype $Aa$: $f_{Aa} = (p_{Aa})^{4} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{4} = \\frac{1^{4}}{2^{4}} = \\frac{1}{16}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the dominance coefficient, $h$, using the provided definition:\n$$h \\equiv \\frac{f_{Aa} - f_{aa}}{f_{AA} - f_{aa}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated phenotypic values:\n$$h = \\frac{\\frac{1}{16} - 0}{1 - 0}$$\n$$h = \\frac{\\frac{1}{16}}{1}$$\n$$h = \\frac{1}{16}$$\n\nThe calculated dominance coefficient is $h = 1/16$. This value is close to 0, which, by the problem's definition, signifies that the mutant allele is strongly dominant (complete dominance of the mutant would give $h=0$).

Let $p$ be the frequency of the dominant allele, $A$, and $q$ be the frequency of the recessive allele, $a$. Since the locus is biallelic, we have the constraint $p + q = 1$.\n\nUnder the assumption of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of the three possible genotypes ($AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$) in the population are given by:\n- Frequency of genotype $AA$: $p^2$\n- Frequency of genotype $Aa$: $2pq$\n- Frequency of genotype $aa$: $q^2$\n\nThe problem states that allele $A$ is completely dominant over allele $a$. This means that individuals with genotypes $AA$ and $Aa$ will both express the dominant phenotype, while only individuals with genotype $aa$ will express the recessive phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the probability of observing the recessive phenotype in a single individual randomly drawn from the population is equal to the frequency of the $aa$ genotype. Let us denote this probability by $\\theta$.\n$$ \\theta = \\text{Freq}(aa) = q^2 $$\nThe probability of observing the dominant phenotype is $1 - \\theta = \\text{Freq}(AA) + \\text{Freq}(Aa) = p^2 + 2pq = (1-q)^2 + 2(1-q)q = 1 - 2q + q^2 + 2q - 2q^2 = 1 - q^2$.\n\nWe have a random sample of $n$ individuals, where each individual's phenotype is an independent draw. This constitutes a series of $n$ Bernoulli trials, where a \"success\" is defined as observing the recessive phenotype. The probability of success in each trial is $\\theta = q^2$. We observe $x$ successes (recessive individuals) and $n-x$ failures (dominant individuals).\n\nThe probability of observing exactly $x$ recessive individuals in a sample of size $n$ is given by the binomial probability mass function. The likelihood function, $L$, is this probability viewed as a function of the parameter of interest, $q$.\n$$ L(q | x, n) = \\binom{n}{x} (q^2)^x (1 - q^2)^{n-x} $$\nTo find the value of $q$ that maximizes this function, it is computationally simpler to maximize the natural logarithm of the likelihood function, the log-likelihood $\\ln(L)$. The value of $q$ that maximizes $\\ln(L)$ will also maximize $L$ because the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function.\n$$ \\ln(L(q | x, n)) = \\ln\\left(\\binom{n}{x}\\right) + \\ln\\left((q^2)^x\\right) + \\ln\\left((1-q^2)^{n-x}\\right) $$\n$$ \\ln(L(q | x, n)) = \\ln\\left(\\binom{n}{x}\\right) + x \\ln(q^2) + (n-x) \\ln(1-q^2) $$\n$$ \\ln(L(q | x, n)) = \\ln\\left(\\binom{n}{x}\\right) + 2x \\ln(q) + (n-x) \\ln(1-q^2) $$\nTo find the maximum, we compute the first derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to $q$ and set it to zero.\n$$ \\frac{d}{dq} \\ln(L) = \\frac{d}{dq} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\binom{n}{x}\\right) + 2x \\ln(q) + (n-x) \\ln(1-q^2) \\right] $$\nThe term $\\ln\\left(\\binom{n}{x}\\right)$ is a constant with respect to $q$, so its derivative is $0$.\n$$ \\frac{d}{dq} \\ln(L) = \\frac{2x}{q} + (n-x) \\frac{1}{1-q^2}(-2q) $$\n$$ \\frac{d}{dq} \\ln(L) = \\frac{2x}{q} - \\frac{2q(n-x)}{1-q^2} $$\nLet $\\hat{q}$ be the maximum likelihood estimator for $q$.
