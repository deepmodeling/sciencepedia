It is a standard problem in statistical inference applied to paleontological data. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the joint maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) for the preservation yield per sampling opportunity, $\\mu$, and the sampling opportunity rate, $\\nu$. The total set of observations comprises two independent components: first, the count and timing of fossil occurrences, and second, the counts of sampling opportunities in partitioned time intervals. The total likelihood function $\\mathcal{L}(\\mu, \\nu)$ is therefore the product of the likelihoods associated with these two independent data sets.\nLet $\\mathcal{L}_1$ be the likelihood function for the fossil occurrence data and $\\mathcal{L}_2$ be the likelihood function for the sampling opportunity data. The total likelihood is $\\mathcal{L}(\\mu, \\nu) = \\mathcal{L}_1(\\mu, \\nu) \\times \\mathcal{L}_2(\\nu)$.\n\nFirst, we construct $\\mathcal{L}_1(\\mu, \\nu)$. The fossil occurrences are modeled as a homogeneous Poisson process with a net observed rate $\\lambda = \\mu \\nu$ over a known time interval $[0, T]$. For a homogeneous Poisson process, the likelihood of observing $n$ events in an interval of duration $T$ is given by the probability density function of the process, which is $\\lambda^n \\exp(-\\lambda T)$. The specific timings of the events do not add information about the rate $\\lambda$ for a homogeneous process, beyond their total count $n$.\nSubstituting $\\lambda = \\mu \\nu$, the likelihood for the fossil data is:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_1(\\mu, \\nu) = (\\mu \\nu)^n \\exp(-\\mu \\nu T) $$\nGiven the data, $n=8$ and $T=10$ Myr, this becomes:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_1(\\mu, \\nu) = (\\mu \\nu)^8 \\exp(-10 \\mu \\nu) $$\n\nSecond, we construct $\\mathcal{L}_2(\\nu)$.

You measure suites of co-genetic whole-rock samples from each ash to construct rubidium–strontium isochrons in the standard coordinate system $x = {}^{87}\\mathrm{Rb}/{}^{86}\\mathrm{Sr}$ and $y = {}^{87}\\mathrm{Sr}/{}^{86}\\mathrm{Sr}$. You then perform weighted least-squares fits and examine the residuals in $y$ as a function of $x$ and the Mean Square of Weighted Deviates (MSWD).\n\nBase your reasoning only on the following fundamentals:\n\n- Radioactive decay and ingrowth: the number of parent atoms evolves as $N_P(t) = N_P(0)\\,e^{-\\lambda t}$ and the number of radiogenic daughter atoms produced is $N_D^\\ast(t) = N_P(0)\\,(1-e^{-\\lambda t})$, with decay constant $\\lambda$ and time $t$.\n- Isochron construction assumes a set of co-genetic samples that shared a common initial daughter-to-normalizer ratio and behaved as a closed system; normalizing to a non-radiogenic isotope (e.g., ${}^{86}\\mathrm{Sr}$ for strontium) renders initial heterogeneity in absolute concentrations irrelevant.\n- Mixing and mass balance: in a two-component mixture, isotope ratios of the mixture are obtained by isotope-specific mass balance and are, in general, rational functions of mixing proportions when ratios are normalized by a third isotope (e.g., ${}^{86}\\mathrm{Sr}$).\n\nFrom these bases, infer how deviations from the closed-system isochron model would project into patterns of isochron residuals when you force a straight-line fit in the $(x,y)$ plane.

The physical models for radioactive decay, isochron construction, mixing, and open-system disturbance are standard and correctly stated. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing sufficient information to deduce the consequences of the specified geological scenarios on the analytical results. No scientific flaws, contradictions, or ambiguities are present. The problem is a valid test of conceptual understanding in geochronology.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid. Proceeding to a solution.\n\n**Derivation of Isochron Model and Perturbations**\n\nFirst, we establish the ideal isochron equation from the provided principles. The number of atoms of the daughter isotope, ${}^{87}\\mathrm{Sr}$ (denoted $D$), at a time $t$ after formation is the sum of the initial number $D_0$ and the number of radiogenic atoms $D^*$ produced by the decay of the parent isotope, ${}^{87}\\mathrm{Rb}$ (denoted $P$).\nFrom the given principles, the number of radiogenic atoms is $D^*(t) = P(0)(1 - e^{-\\lambda t})$. Using the decay law $P(0) = P(t)e^{\\lambda t}$, this becomes $D^*(t) = P(t)(e^{\\lambda t} - 1)$.\nThe total number of daughter atoms is $D(t) = D_0 + P(t)(e^{\\lambda t} - 1)$.\nTo construct an isochron, we normalize to a stable, non-radiogenic isotope of the same element, ${}^{86}\\mathrm{Sr}$ (denoted $S_{ref}$). This isotope is not produced by decay and its amount is constant. Dividing by $S_{ref}$ yields:\n$$ \\frac{D(t)}{S_{ref}} = \\frac{D_0}{S_{ref}} + \\frac{P(t)}{S_{ref}}(e^{\\lambda t} - 1) $$\nThis equation is of the form $y = y_0 + x \\cdot m$, where the coordinates are $y = {}^{87}\\mathrm{Sr}/{}^{86}\\mathrm{Sr}$ and $x = {}^{87}\\mathrm{Rb}/{}^{86}\\mathrm{Sr}$. The initial ratio is $y_0 = ({}^{87}\\mathrm{Sr}/{}^{86}\\mathrm{Sr})_0$, and the slope is $m = e^{\\lambda t} - 1$. A set of co-genetic samples will have the same age $t$ and initial ratio $y_0$, so they must plot on a straight line (the isochron) in the $(x, y)$ plane.\n\nWe now analyze the two specified geological complications.\n\n**Scenario 1: Contamination by Two-Component Mixing**\nLet the juvenile ash be endmember $A$ and the detrital contaminant be endmember $C$. A measured sample is a mixture containing a mass fraction $f$ of contaminant $C$ and $(1-f)$ of ash $A$. The concentration of any isotope $I$ in the mixture, $[I]_M$, is given by the mass balance equation: $[I]_M = f[I]_C + (1-f)[I]_A$.\nThe coordinates $x_M$ and $y_M$ for the mixture are:\n$$ x_M = \\frac{[{}^{87}\\mathrm{Rb}]_M}{[{}^{86}\\mathrm{Sr}]_M} = \\frac{f \\cdot [{}^{87}\\mathrm{Rb}]_C + (1-f) \\cdot [{}^{87}\\mathrm{Rb}]_A}{f \\cdot [{}^{86}\\mathrm{Sr}]_C + (1-f) \\cdot [{}^{86}\\mathrm{Sr}]_A} $$\n$$ y_M = \\frac{[{}^{87}\\mathrm{Sr}]_M}{[{}^{86}\\mathrm{Sr}]_M} = \\frac{f \\cdot [{}^{87}\\mathrm{Sr}]_C + (1-f) \\cdot [{}^{87}\\mathrm{Sr}]_A}{f \\cdot [{}^{86}\\mathrm{Sr}]_C + (1-f) \\cdot [{}^{86}\\mathrm{Sr}]_A} $$\nAs correctly stated in the problem's fundamentals, these are rational functions of the mixing fraction $f$. In the general case where the concentration of the normalizing isotope, $[{}^{86}\\mathrm{Sr}]$, differs between the endmembers $A$ and $C$, the locus of points $(x_M, y_M)$ for $f \\in [0, 1]$ forms a hyperbolic curve, not a straight line.\nIf a straight line is force-fit to data that lies on a curve, the residuals, $r_i = y_{i,measured} - y_{i,fitted}$, will exhibit a systematic, non-random pattern. For a simple concave or convex curve, the residuals will typically be of one sign at the ends of the data range and the opposite sign in the middle (e.g., negative-positive-negative). This creates a structured, often \"S-shaped\" or parabolic pattern in a plot of residuals versus $x$. The failure of the linear model to describe the curved data will result in a large MSWD value (MSWD $\\gg 1$), indicating a poor fit. The samples closest to the pure endmembers (low and high $f$) are high-leverage points that define the curvature most strongly. Removing them may cause the remaining, more central points to appear more linear, thus artefactually improving the fit statistics (i.e., decreasing the MSWD).\n\n**Scenario 2: Open-System Loss of Radiogenic ${}^{87}\\mathrm{Sr}$**\nThis disturbance occurs after the system has evolved for an age $t$. The measured $y$ value is altered. Let a fraction $\\alpha_i$ of the *radiogenic* ${}^{87}\\mathrm{Sr}$ be lost from sample $i$. The amount of radiogenic ${}^{87}\\mathrm{Sr}$ in sample $i$ is $D_i^* = P_i(t)(e^{\\lambda t}-1)$.\nThe measured ${}^{87}\\mathrm{Sr}$ value, $D'_{i}$, becomes $D'_{i} = D_0 + (1-\\alpha_i)D_i^*$.\nDividing by $S_{ref}$ for sample $i$:\n$$ y'_i = \\frac{D_0}{S_{ref}} + (1-\\alpha_i) \\frac{P_i(t)}{S_{ref}}(e^{\\lambda t}-1) = y_0 + (1-\\alpha_i) x_i m $$\nThe original, unperturbed value was $y_i = y_0 + x_i m$. The perturbation moves each point $(x_i, y_i)$ vertically downwards to a new position $(x_i, y'_i)$. The magnitude of the displacement is $\\Delta y_i = y'_i - y_i = -\\alpha_i x_i m$.\nThis displacement is proportional to $x_i$: samples with higher Rb/Sr ratios (larger $x_i$) have produced more radiogenic ${}^{87}\\mathrm{Sr}$ and therefore experience a larger absolute depression in their $y$ value for a given fractional loss $\\alpha_i$.\nBecause the fractional loss $\\alpha_i$ varies among samples, this introduces scatter. The points no longer lie on a single line. The overall effect is to rotate the point array to a shallower slope, yielding a falsely young age. The superimposed random variation in $\\alpha_i$ adds scatter that is not accounted for by analytical uncertainty, hence the MSWD will be elevated (MSWD $> 1$).\nRegarding the residuals from a new best-fit line: the downward displacement is greatest for high-$x$ samples. A best-fit line will attempt to pass through this disturbed cloud of points. The low-$x$ samples are least affected and may anchor the fit near the true intercept. Consequently, the high-$x$ samples, having been pulled down significantly, will tend to lie below the best-fit line, resulting in large negative residuals. The magnitude of these negative residuals would trend towards more negative values as $x$ increases. This indicates that the variance of the residuals increases with $x$ (heteroscedasticity).\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Two-component contamination by mixing will generally produce systematic curvature in the $(x,y)$ array because the mixture ratios are rational functions of the mixing fraction. When a straight line is forced, the signed residuals in $y$ versus $x$ will typically reverse sign across the $x$ range (e.g., negative at low and high $x$, positive at intermediate $x$, or the converse), yielding an “S-shaped” pattern and an elevated MSWD that decreases markedly if high-leverage endmembers are removed.**\nThis statement is a precise and accurate summary of the consequences of two-component mixing, as derived above. The curvature, systematic residuals, elevated MSWD, and effect of removing endmembers are all classic indicators of mixing.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Open-system loss of radiogenic ${}^{87}\\mathrm{Sr}$ after closure will, if the fractional loss differs among samples, preferentially depress $y$ for samples with larger $x$ because the radiogenic ingrowth term scales with $x$. Relative to a common best-fit slope, the residuals will tend to be negative and increase in magnitude approximately proportionally with $x$, and the MSWD will be elevated.**\nThis statement accurately describes the effect of ${}^{87}\\mathrm{Sr}$ loss. The depression of $y$ is indeed greater for larger $x$. The resulting scatter will elevate the MSWD. The description of the residual pattern—a tendency for increasingly negative residuals at high $x$—is a plausible and recognized diagnostic feature of this process, as it reflects the clockwise rotation of the data array around a low-$x$ pivot.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Two-component contamination by mixing will leave the residuals structureless and independent of $x$ (random about zero), because mixing only increases random scatter; MSWD will be near unity, and removal of leverage points will have little effect.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. Mixing is a deterministic process that creates curvature, not random scatter. This leads to structured residuals and a high MSWD. The effect of removing leverage points is substantial, contrary to the claim.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Open-system loss of radiogenic ${}^{87}\\mathrm{Rb}$ after closure will make residuals symmetric about zero and largest at low $x$, with an apparently older (steeper) slope; because $y$ is unaffected, the residuals should not correlate with $x$ and MSWD will remain near unity.**\nThis option describes a different scenario, loss of the parent isotope ${}^{87}\\mathrm{Rb}$. Loss of Rb affects the $x$-coordinate, moving points horizontally to the left. This does lead to a steeper slope and an older apparent age. However, the claims about the residuals are incorrect. The disturbance is systematic, leading to a correlated pattern of residuals (e.g., negative at low $x'$, positive at high $x'$), not a symmetric one. This systematic deviation from a line will cause the MSWD to be elevated, not near unity.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on this analysis, options A and B correctly describe the diagnostic patterns for the two specified scenarios.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "2798029"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal of collecting fossil and molecular data is to reconstruct the tree of life and test evolutionary hypotheses.

Thus, each tree will have $n-3 = 6-3 = 3$ nontrivial splits.\n\nLet $S_{morph}$ be the set of nontrivial splits for the morphology tree, and $S_{mol}$ be the set for the molecular tree. The taxa are $\\{A,B,C,D,E,F\\}$.\n\nFirst, we identify the splits for the morphology tree, given by the Newick string $((A,B),(C,D),(E,F))$. This topology groups the taxa into three pairs. The three internal edges separate each pair from the rest.\nThe splits are:\n1. The edge separating the clade $(A,B)$ from the rest. This bipartition is $\\{A, B\\} | \\{C, D, E, F\\}$.\n2. The edge separating the clade $(C,D)$ from the rest. This bipartition is $\\{C, D\\} | \\{A, B, E, F\\}$.\n3. The edge separating the clade $(E,F)$ from the rest. This bipartition is $\\{E, F\\} | \\{A, B, C, D\\}$.\n\nSo, the set of splits for the morphology tree is:\n$$S_{morph} = \\{ \\{A, B\\} | \\{C, D, E, F\\}, \\quad \\{C, D\\} | \\{A, B, E, F\\}, \\quad \\{E, F\\} | \\{A, B, C, D\\} \\}$$\n\nNext, we identify the splits for the molecular tree, given by the Newick string $((A,B),(C,E),(D,F))$. This topology also groups taxa into pairs, but differently.\nThe splits are:\n1. The edge separating the clade $(A,B)$ from the rest. This bipartition is $\\{A, B\\} | \\{C, D, E, F\\}$.\n2. The edge separating the clade $(C,E)$ from the rest. This bipartition is $\\{C, E\\} | \\{A, B, D, F\\}$.\n3. The edge separating the clade $(D,F)$ from the rest. This bipartition is $\\{D, F\\} | \\{A, B, C, E\\}$.\n\nSo, the set of splits for the molecular tree is:\n$$S_{mol} = \\{ \\{A, B\\} | \\{C, D, E, F\\}, \\quad \\{C, E\\} | \\{A, B, D, F\\}, \\quad \\{D, F\\} | \\{A, B, C, E\\} \\}$$\n\nNow, we compute the Robinson-Foulds distance, $RF_{obs}$. The $RF$ distance is given by the formula:\n$$RF(T_1, T_2) = |S_1| + |S_2| - 2|S_1 \\cap S_2|$$\nWe must find the intersection of the two split sets, $S_{morph} \\cap S_{mol}$. By comparing the elements of $S_{morph}$ and $S_{mol}$, we find only one split in common:\n$$S_{morph} \\cap S_{mol} = \\{ \\{A, B\\} | \\{C, D, E, F\\} \\}$$\nThe number of shared splits is $|S_{morph} \\cap S_{mol}| = 1$.\nThe number of splits in each tree is $|S_{morph}| = |S_{mol}| = 3$.\nSubstituting these values into the formula for the RF distance:\n$$RF_{obs} = 3 + 3 - 2(1) = 4$$\nThe observed Robinson-Foulds distance between the morphology and molecular trees is $4$.\n\nStep 2: Compute the one-sided permutation $p$-value.\n\nThe problem defines the $p$-value for excess congruence as the fraction of permuted $RF$ distances that are less than or equal to the observed $RF$ distance. \"Excess congruence\" corresponds to an unusually low $RF$ distance, as $RF$ is a measure of dissimilarity.\n\nThe observed distance is $RF_{obs} = 4$.\nThe set of $N=20$ permuted $RF$ distances is given as:\n$$\\{6, 6, 6, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6\\}$$\nWe must count the number of values in this set that are less than or equal to $4$. Let this count be $k$.\nBy inspecting the set, we find two values equal to $4$ and no values less than $4$.\nTherefore, $k=2$.\n\nThe total number of permutations is $N=20$.\nThe $p$-value is the fraction $\\frac{k}{N}$.\n$$p = \\frac{2}{20} = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$p = 0.1000$$\nThis is the final calculated $p$-value.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1000}$$", "id": "2798010"}]}
