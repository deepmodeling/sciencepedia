The language is precise and uses standard terminology. There are no scientific violations, contradictions, or ambiguities. The problem is a standard, non-trivial exercise in mathematical biology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe dynamics of the two-species competitive system are described by the Lotka-Volterra competition equations, which, based on the principle of additive crowding, are:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_1}{dt} = r_1 N_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{N_1 + \\alpha_{12} N_2}{K_1}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dN_2}{dt} = r_2 N_2 \\left(1 - \\frac{N_2 + \\alpha_{21} N_1}{K_2}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $N_1$ and $N_2$ are the population sizes, $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the intrinsic growth rates, $K_1$ and $K_2$ are the carrying capacities, and $\\alpha_{12}$ and $\\alpha_{21}$ are the competition coefficients.\n\nThe zero-growth isoclines are found by setting the growth rates to zero, i.e., $\\frac{dN_1}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dN_2}{dt} = 0$. For a non-trivial equilibrium (where $N_1 \\neq 0$ and $N_2 \\neq 0$), this requires the terms in the parentheses to be zero.\n\nFor species $1$, the isocline is given by:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{N_1 + \\alpha_{12} N_2}{K_1} = 0 \\implies N_1 + \\alpha_{12} N_2 = K_1\n$$\nSolving for $N_1$ as a function of $N_2$, we get the equation for the species $1$ isocline:\n$$\nN_1 = K_1 - \\alpha_{12} N_2\n$$\nThis is a line that intercepts the $N_1$-axis at $N_1 = K_1$ and the $N_2$-axis at $N_2 = K_1 / \\alpha_{12}$.\n\nFor species $2$, the isocline is given by:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{N_2 + \\alpha_{21} N_1}{K_2} = 0 \\implies N_2 + \\alpha_{21} N_1 = K_2\n$$\nSolving for $N_2$ as a function of $N_1$, we get the equation for the species $2$ isocline:\n$$\nN_2 = K_2 - \\alpha_{21} N_1\n$$\nThis is a line that intercepts the $N_2$-axis at $N_2 = K_2$ and the $N_1$-axis at $N_1 = K_2 / \\alpha_{21}$.\n\nThe internal coexistence equilibrium, denoted $(N_1^{\\ast}, N_2^{\\ast})$, is the point where both populations have zero growth, which corresponds to the intersection of the two isoclines. We solve the following system of linear equations:\n$$\nN_1^{\\ast} + \\alpha_{12} N_2^{\\ast} = K_1\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_{21} N_1^{\\ast} + N_2^{\\ast} = K_2\n$$\nSolving this system yields the equilibrium abundances:\n$$\nN_1^{\\ast} = \\frac{K_1 - \\alpha_{12} K_2}{1 - \\alpha_{12} \\alpha_{21}}\n$$\n$$\nN_2^{\\ast} = \\frac{K_2 - \\alpha_{21} K_1}{1 - \\alpha_{12} \\alpha_{21}}\n$$\nFor this equilibrium to be biologically meaningful (positive, i.e., $N_1^{\\ast}  0$ and $N_2^{\\ast}  0$) and locally stable, two conditions must be met. Local stability analysis of the Jacobian matrix shows that the equilibrium is stable if and only if $1 - \\alpha_{12} \\alpha_{21}  0$, which is equivalent to $\\alpha_{12} \\alpha_{21}  1$. Given this condition, for the numerators to also be positive to ensure $N_1^{\\ast}, N_2^{\\ast}  0$, we require $K_1 - \\alpha_{12} K_2  0$ and $K_2 - \\alpha_{21} K_1  0$.\n\nThese conditions for stable coexistence can be interpreted graphically by comparing the intercepts of the isoclines:\n1. $K_1 - \\alpha_{12} K_2  0 \\implies K_1  \\alpha_{12} K_2 \\implies K_1/\\alpha_{12}  K_2$. This means the $N_2$-intercept of species $1$'s isocline is above the $N_2$-intercept of species $2$'s isocline.\n2. $K_2 - \\alpha_{21} K_1  0 \\implies K_2  \\alpha_{21} K_1 \\implies K_2/\\alpha_{21}  K_1$. This means the $N_1$-intercept of species $2$'s isocline is to the right of the $N_1$-intercept of species $1$'s isocline.\n\nIn summary, stable coexistence occurs when each species inhibits its own growth more strongly than it inhibits the other's growth. Graphically, this means the isoclines cross, with the species $1$ isocline having a higher $N_2$-intercept and the species $2$ isocline having a higher $N_1$-intercept. Other configurations of the intercepts lead to competitive exclusion or bistability.\n\nNow we apply this framework to the given parameter set: $r_1 = 1.0$, $r_2 = 0.8$, $K_1 = 100$, $K_2 = 120$, $\\alpha_{12} = 0.6$, and $\\alpha_{21} = 0.7$. Note that the growth rates $r_1$ and $r_2$ affect the speed at which the system approaches equilibrium but not the position or stability of the equilibrium itself.\n\nFirst, we compute the isocline intercepts:\n- Species $1$ isocline ($N_1 + 0.6 N_2 = 100$):\n  - $N_1$-intercept: $K_1 = 100$.\n  - $N_2$-intercept: $K_1/\\alpha_{12} = 100 / 0.6 \\approx 166.67$.\n- Species $2$ isocline ($N_2 + 0.7 N_1 = 120$):\n  - $N_1$-intercept: $K_2/\\alpha_{21} = 120 / 0.7 \\approx 171.43$.\n  - $N_2$-intercept: $K_2 = 120$.\n\nNext, we compare the intercepts to determine the outcome:\n- On the $N_1$-axis, the intercept for species $2$'s isocline ($K_2/\\alpha_{21} \\approx 171.43$) is greater than for species $1$'s isocline ($K_1 = 100$).\n- On the $N_2$-axis, the intercept for species $1$'s isocline ($K_1/\\alpha_{12} \\approx 166.67$) is greater than for species $2$'s isocline ($K_2 = 120$).\n\nThis configuration ($K_2/\\alpha_{21}  K_1$ and $K_1/\\alpha_{12}  K_2$) corresponds to the case of stable coexistence. The conditions $K_1  \\alpha_{12}K_2$ and $K_2  \\alpha_{21}K_1$ are satisfied, implying a positive and stable internal equilibrium exists. A check of the competition coefficients product, $\\alpha_{12}\\alpha_{21} = (0.6)(0.7) = 0.42  1$, confirms the stability.\n\nFinally, we compute the coordinates of this stable coexistence equilibrium $(N_1^{\\ast}, N_2^{\\ast})$:\n$$\nN_1^{\\ast} = \\frac{K_1 - \\alpha_{12} K_2}{1 - \\alpha_{12} \\alpha_{21}} = \\frac{100 - (0.6)(120)}{1 - (0.6)(0.7)} = \\frac{100 - 72}{1 - 0.42} = \\frac{28}{0.58} \\approx 48.27586 \\ldots\n$$\n$$\nN_2^{\\ast} = \\frac{K_2 - \\alpha_{21} K_1}{1 - \\alpha_{12} \\alpha_{21}} = \\frac{120 - (0.7)(100)}{1 - (0.6)(0.7)} = \\frac{120 - 70}{1 - 0.42} = \\frac{50}{0.58} \\approx 86.20689 \\ldots\n$$\nRounding these values to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\nN_1^{\\ast} \\approx 48.28\n$$\n$$\nN_2^{\\ast} \\approx 86.21\n$$\nThe long-term outcome is a stable coexistence equilibrium at approximately $(48.28, 86.21)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n48.28  86.21\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2810620"}, {"introduction": "While Lotka-Volterra models are phenomenological, resource-competition theory offers a powerful mechanistic framework for predicting competitive outcomes.

A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe core principle for a species' persistence at steady state in a chemostat is that its per-capita growth rate must exactly balance its per-capita loss rate. The loss rate for any non-adhering species in a chemostat is the dilution rate, $D$. The growth rate for species $i$ is given by the Monod function, $\\mu_i(R) = m_i \\frac{R}{q_i + R}$.\n\nThe equilibrium condition for species $i$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\mu_i(R) = D\n$$\nThe value $R_i^{\\ast}$ is defined as the resource concentration $R$ that satisfies this equilibrium condition. We substitute the expression for $\\mu_i(R)$ and solve for $R_i^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nm_i \\frac{R_i^{\\ast}}{q_i + R_i^{\\ast}} = D\n$$\nTo solve for $R_i^{\\ast}$, we perform algebraic manipulation:\n$$\nm_i R_i^{\\ast} = D (q_i + R_i^{\\ast})\n$$\n$$\nm_i R_i^{\\ast} = D q_i + D R_i^{\\ast}\n$$\n$$\nm_i R_i^{\\ast} - D R_i^{\\ast} = D q_i\n$$\n$$\n(m_i - D) R_i^{\\ast} = D q_i\n$$\nThis yields the expression for $R_i^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nR_i^{\\ast} = \\frac{D q_i}{m_i - D}\n$$\nFor a species to be capable of persisting in the chemostat, it must be able to achieve a growth rate at least equal to the dilution rate $D$. Since the maximum possible growth rate for species $i$ is $m_i$ (achieved as $R \\to \\infty$), a necessary condition for persistence is $m_i  D$. If this condition is not met ($m_i \\le D$), the species cannot grow fast enough to counteract washout, and it cannot persist. The derived expression for $R_i^{\\ast}$ reflects this: if $m_i  D$, then $R_i^{\\ast}$ is positive, representing a physically meaningful resource concentration. If $m_i  D$, $R_i^{\\ast}$ becomes negative, which is not a physically possible concentration and indicates that no non-negative resource level can support the population. If $m_i = D$, the expression is undefined, implying an infinite resource concentration would be needed for survival.\n\nNow, we compute $R_1^{\\ast}$ and $R_2^{\\ast}$ using the provided parameters:\n$D = 0.2$ $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, $m_1 = 0.1$ $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, $q_1 = 0.05$ $\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$, $m_2 = 0.12$ $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, $q_2 = 0.06$ $\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.\n\nFor species 1:\nThe condition for persistence is $m_1  D$, which is $0.1  0.2$. This is false. Species 1 cannot persist. The formal calculation for $R_1^{\\ast}$ using the derived formula is:\n$$\nR_1^{\\ast} = \\frac{D q_1}{m_1 - D} = \\frac{(0.2)(0.05)}{0.1 - 0.2} = \\frac{0.01}{-0.1} = -0.1\n$$\n\nFor species 2:\nThe condition for persistence is $m_2  D$, which is $0.12  0.2$. This is also false. Species 2 cannot persist. The formal calculation for $R_2^{\\ast}$ is:\n$$\nR_2^{\\ast} = \\frac{D q_2}{m_2 - D} = \\frac{(0.2)(0.06)}{0.12 - 0.2} = \\frac{0.012}{-0.08} = -\\frac{12}{80} = -\\frac{3}{20} = -0.15\n$$\n\nFinally, we determine the competitive outcome. The principle of competitive exclusion by resource competition ($R^{\\ast}$ theory) states that, for a single limiting resource, the species with the lowest positive $R_i^{\\ast}$ (provided $R_i^{\\ast}  R_{\\mathrm{in}}$) will exclude all others.\n\nIn this case, both calculated values, $R_1^{\\ast} = -0.1$ and $R_2^{\\ast} = -0.15$, are negative. This indicates that the persistence condition ($m_i  D$) is not met for either species. Neither species can attain a growth rate equal to the dilution rate, even at saturating resource levels. Therefore, both populations will decline to extinction. They are washed out of the chemostat.\n\nAccording to the provided encoding scheme, the outcome where both species are washed out is represented by $C = 0$.\n\nThe final result vector is $\\begin{pmatrix} R_1^{\\ast}  R_2^{\\ast}  C \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$R_1^{\\ast} = -0.1$\n$R_2^{\\ast} = -0.15$\n$C = 0$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -0.1  -0.15  0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2810631"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate test of any ecological model is its ability to explain real-world data.

The problem is well-defined, scientifically grounded, and computationally tractable. I will proceed with the validation and then the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Experimental Setup**: A set of $n$ independent trials. In trial $i$, an initial number of prey $N_i$ is exposed to one predator for duration $T_i$ (hours). The number of prey consumed is $y_i$. Prey density is constant during each trial (continuous-replacement).\n- **Observation Model**: For each trial $i$, the number of consumed prey $y_i$ follows a Binomial distribution, conditional on the capture probability $p_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$: $y_i \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(N_i, p_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}))$.\n- **Capture Probability Model**: The capture probability is derived from a Poisson process for encounters. The per-prey hazard rate is $h_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}; N_i)$. The survival probability for a single prey over time $T_i$ is $\\exp(-h_i T_i)$. The capture probability is $p_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = 1 - \\exp(-h_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}; N_i) T_i)$.\n- **Model $\\mathcal{M}_1$ (Type I)**: Constant per-prey hazard, parameterized by a rate parameter $a$. $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_1 = (a)$.\n- **Model $\\mathcal{M}_2$ (Type II)**: Saturating total capture rate, leading to a per-prey hazard that decreases with $N_i$. Parameterized by search rate $a$ and handling time $h$. $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_2 = (a, h)$.\n- **Model $\\mathcal{M}_3$ (Type III)**: Sigmoid total capture rate, leading to a per-prey hazard with an accelerating component at low $N_i$. Parameterized by search rate $a$ and handling time $h$. $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_3 = (a, h)$.\n- **Parameter Constraints**: $a  0$ for $\\mathcal{M}_1$. $a  0$ and $h  0$ for $\\mathcal{M}_2, \\mathcal{M}_3$.\n- **Tasks**:\n    1. Derive the log-likelihood $\\ell_m(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_m \\mid \\text{data})$ for each model $m \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ from first principles.\n    2. Obtain Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLEs) $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_m$ and compute AIC and AICc using the formulas:\n       $$ \\mathrm{AIC}_m = 2 k_m - 2 \\ell_m(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_m) $$\n       $$ \\mathrm{AICc}_m = \\mathrm{AIC}_m + \\frac{2 k_m (k_m + 1)}{n - k_m - 1} $$\n       where $k_m$ is the number of parameters and $n$ is the number of trials, assuming $n  k_m + 1$.\n    3. Assess local identifiability at $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_m$ using two conditions:\n        - The observed Fisher information matrix (negative Hessian of the log-likelihood at $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_m$) is positive definite with a finite condition number.\n        - The sensitivity matrix (Jacobian of capture probabilities $p_i$ with respect to $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_m$ at $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_m$) has full column rank.\n        A model passes if both conditions hold and parameters are in the interior of their feasible space.\n    4. Model selection rule: Among identifiable models, select the one with the minimum AICc. Ties (within $\\varepsilon = 10^{-6}$) are broken by choosing smaller $k_m$, then smaller model index $m$. If no model is identifiable, no model is selected.\n- **Datasets**:\n    - Dataset A: $N = [5,20,40,5,20,40,10]$, $T = [1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.5]$, $y = [1,3,4,2,5,8,2]$.\n    - Dataset B: $N = [8,16,32,8,16,32,32]$, $T = [1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.5]$, $y = [1,2,4,2,4,8,2]$.\n    - Dataset C: $N = [20,20,20,20]$, $T = [0.5,1.0,2.0,3.0]$, $y = [1,3,5,7]$.\n- **Output Format**: A single line `[[m_A,b_A],[m_B,b_B],[m_C,b_C]]` where $m$ is the model index ($0$ for none) and $b$ is the identifiability flag ($1$ for pass, $0$ for fail).\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, drawing upon canonical models (Type I, II, III functional responses) and standard statistical methods (Binomial likelihood, MLE, AICc, identifiability analysis) used in quantitative ecology. The derivation from a Poisson process for encounters is a rigorous and well-established approach for modeling such experiments. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data, formulas, and clear, objective criteria for model fitting and selection. The datasets are complete and do not contain obvious contradictions or infeasible values. The tasks are all formalizable and lead to a unique solution based on the prescribed methodology. There are no signs of Unsoundness, Non-Formalizability, Incompleteness, Unrealistic Conditions, or other flaws listed in the validation criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution involves three main parts: (1) derivation of the log-likelihood functions for the three models from first principles, (2) specification of the numerical procedures for model fitting and identifiability assessment, and (3) implementation of these procedures to analyze the provided datasets.\n\n#### 1. Derivation of the Log-Likelihood Functions\n\nThe foundation for all models is the Binomial observation model for the number of prey consumed, $y_i$, in trial $i$:\n$$ y_i \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(N_i, p_i) $$\nwhere $N_i$ is the number of prey available and $p_i$ is the probability that any single prey individual is captured during the trial of duration $T_i$. The probability mass function for a single trial is:\n$$ P(y_i \\mid N_i, p_i) = \\binom{N_i}{y_i} p_i^{y_i} (1 - p_i)^{N_i - y_i} $$\nThe capture probability $p_i$ is given by $p_i = 1 - \\exp(-h_i T_i)$, where $h_i$ is the constant per-prey hazard rate during trial $i$. Substituting this into the likelihood gives:\n$$ 1 - p_i = \\exp(-h_i T_i) $$\nThe log-likelihood for a single trial is therefore:\n$$ \\log L_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\log\\binom{N_i}{y_i} + y_i \\log\\left(1 - \\exp(-h_i T_i)\\right) + (N_i - y_i) \\log\\left(\\exp(-h_i T_i)\\right) $$\n$$ \\log L_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\log\\binom{N_i}{y_i} + y_i \\log\\left(1 - \\exp(-h_i T_i)\\right) - (N_i - y_i) h_i T_i $$\nSince trials are independent, the total log-likelihood for a dataset of $n$ trials is the sum over all trials:\n$$ \\ell(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\text{data}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[ \\log\\binom{N_i}{y_i} + y_i \\log\\left(1 - \\exp(-h_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}; N_i) T_i)\\right) - (N_i - y_i) h_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}; N_i) T_i \\right] $$\nThe models differ in their definition of the per-prey hazard $h_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}; N_i)$.\n\n**Model $\\mathcal{M}_1$ (Type I)**\nThis model assumes a constant per-prey hazard rate, independent of prey density $N_i$. The only parameter is the attack rate $a$.\n- **Hazard Rate**: $h_{i,1}(a; N_i) = a$\n- **Parameters**: $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_1 = (a)$, with $a  0$. Number of parameters $k_1 = 1$.\n- **Capture Probability**: $p_{i,1}(a) = 1 - \\exp(-a T_i)$\n- **Log-Likelihood**:\n$$ \\ell_1(a \\mid \\text{data}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[ \\log\\binom{N_i}{y_i} + y_i \\log\\left(1 - \\exp(-a T_i)\\right) - (N_i - y_i) a T_i \\right] $$\n\n**Model $\\mathcal{M}_2$ (Type II)**\nThis model assumes a saturating total capture rate due to predator handling time. The per-prey hazard decreases with prey density. The derivation from first principles considers the predator's time budget. Let the total time be $T_{total}$. It is divided into searching time ($T_s$) and handling time ($T_{handle}$). The number of prey encountered and captured is $C = a' N_i T_s$, where $a'$ is an instantaneous search rate and $N_i$ is prey density. The total handling time for these captures is $T_{handle} = h C = h a' N_i T_s$.\nThe time budget is $T_{total} = T_s + T_{handle} = T_s(1 + h a' N_i)$.\nThe proportion of time the predator spends searching is $\\frac{T_s}{T_{total}} = \\frac{1}{1 + h a' N_i}$.\nThe per-prey encounter rate, which is the hazard $h_i$, is the product of the predator's search rate and the proportion of time it is searching. Let $a$ be the search rate parameter.\n- **Hazard Rate**: $h_{i,2}(a, h; N_i) = a \\times \\frac{1}{1 + a h N_i} = \\frac{a}{1 + a h N_i}$\n- **Parameters**: $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_2 = (a, h)$, with $a  0, h  0$. Number of parameters $k_2 = 2$.\n- **Capture Probability**: $p_{i,2}(a, h) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a T_i}{1 + a h N_i}\\right)$\n- **Log-Likelihood**:\n$$ \\ell_2(a,h \\mid \\text{data}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[ \\log\\binom{N_i}{y_i} + y_i \\log\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a T_i}{1+ahN_i}\\right)\\right) - (N_i - y_i) \\frac{a T_i}{1+ahN_i} \\right] $$\n\n**Model $\\mathcal{M}_3$ (Type III)**\nThis model features a sigmoid total capture rate, where the attack rate itself increases with prey density, for example due to predator learning or prey switching. A common way to model this while retaining the two parameters $(a, h)$ is to make the effective search rate density-dependent, e.g., proportional to $N_i$. Following the logic for Type II, we replace the constant search rate $a$ in the numerator of the total capture rate with a term that depends on $N_i$, typically $a N_i$. The total number of prey consumed per unit time is $N_i \\times h_i$. A standard form for a sigmoid capture rate is $\\frac{a' N_i^2}{b+N_i^2}$. The formulation consistent with our hazard derivation is to modify the Type II logic. Let the instantaneous attack coefficient be $a N_i$. The time budget argument then gives a hazardrate $h_i = \\frac{a N_i}{1 + h (a N_i) N_i}$.\n- **Hazard Rate**: $h_{i,3}(a, h; N_i) = \\frac{a N_i}{1 + a h N_i^2}$\n- **Parameters**: $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_3 = (a, h)$, with $a  0, h  0$. Number of parameters $k_3 = 2$.\n- **Capture Probability**: $p_{i,3}(a, h) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a N_i T_i}{1 + a h N_i^2}\\right)$\n- **Log-Likelihood**:\n$$ \\ell_3(a,h \\mid \\text{data}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[ \\log\\binom{N_i}{y_i} + y_i \\log\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a N_i T_i}{1+ahN_i^2}\\right)\\right) - (N_i - y_i) \\frac{a N_i T_i}{1+ahN_i^2} \\right] $$\n\n#### 2. Model Fitting and Selection Procedure\n\nFor each model $\\mathcal{M}_m$, the parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_m$ are estimated by maximizing the log-likelihood $\\ell_m(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_m)$, which is equivalent to minimizing the negative log-likelihood $-\\ell_m(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_m)$. The constraints $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_m  0$ are handled by optimizing over the log-transformed parameters. Let $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_m = \\log(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_m)$. A numerical optimization routine (e.g., BFGS) is used to find the MLE $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}_m$, from which we obtain $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_m = \\exp(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}_m)$.\n\nAfter fitting, each model is assessed for local identifiability at the MLE $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_m$. A model is deemed identifiable if it passes two numerical checks:\n1.  **Observed Fisher Information Condition**: The observed Fisher information matrix, $\\mathcal{I}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_m)$, is computed as the negative Hessian of the log-likelihood evaluated at the MLE: $\\mathcal{I}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_m) = -\\nabla^2 \\ell_m(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_m)$. The matrix must be positive definite (all eigenvalues are strictly positive) and have a finite condition number (ratio of largest to smallest eigenvalue) below a set threshold (e.g., $10^8$). This Hessian is computed numerically using a finite difference approximation of the analytical gradient of the log-likelihood.\n2.  **Sensitivity (Jacobian) Rank Condition**: The sensitivity matrix $J$ is constructed, where its $(i, j)$-th element is the partial derivative of the $i$-th capture probability $p_i$ with respect to the $j$-th parameter, evaluated at $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_m$: $J_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial p_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_m)}{\\partial \\theta_{m,j}}\\Big|_{\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_m}$. This $n \\times k_m$ matrix must have full column rank, i.e., $\\mathrm{rank}(J) = k_m$.\n\nThe model selection is performed on the subset of models that pass the identifiability checks. The Akaike Information Criterion with small-sample correction (AICc) is calculated for each identifiable model:\n$$ \\mathrm{AICc}_m = 2 k_m - 2 \\ell_m(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_m) + \\frac{2 k_m (k_m + 1)}{n - k_m - 1} $$\nThe model with the lowest AICc value is chosen. The specified tie-breaking rules are applied if necessary.
