This represents the fraction of energy or biomass that is successfully converted into new biomass at the next trophic level. At steady state, this relationship is:\n$$P_H = E_t P_P$$\n\nThe objective is to find the ratio of herbivore biomass to producer biomass, $\\frac{B_H}{B_P}$.

This is possible because the producers (phytoplankton) have an extremely high turnover rate, meaning a small standing stock of biomass can support a much larger biomass of consumers due to its rapid production and consumption. The pyramid of production, however, remains upright, as $P_H = 0.1 P_P$.\n\nThe two numerical results for the herbivore-to-producer biomass ratio, in the requested order of terrestrial and aquatic, are $0.200$ and $6.00$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.200 & 6.00\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2846846"}]}
