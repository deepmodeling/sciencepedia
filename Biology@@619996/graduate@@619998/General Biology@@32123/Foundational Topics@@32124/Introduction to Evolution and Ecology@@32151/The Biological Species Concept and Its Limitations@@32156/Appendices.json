Let reproductive isolation quantify the proportional reduction in expected gene transmission through heterospecific matings relative to a conspecific baseline. Assume the mating process is a sequence of stages that must all be passed for gene transmission to occur: a set of prezygotic stages (ecological co-occurrence, courtship acceptance, gametic compatibility) followed by postzygotic stages (zygote survival to adulthood, fertility). Assume that stage outcomes are conditionally independent given entry into that stage and that stage effects combine multiplicatively along the sequence.\n\nTask:\n1) Starting from the definition that total reproductive isolation equals one minus the ratio of expected gene transmission through heterospecific matings to that through conspecific matings, derive an expression for the total isolation in terms of a prezygotic isolation index and a postzygotic isolation index. Clearly state any assumptions you use and ensure that each index is defined from first principles as a ratio of stage-specific probabilities or expected contributions.\n\n2) Using the following empirically measured counts and averages from common-garden experiments, compute the prezygotic isolation index, the postzygotic isolation index, and then the total isolation using your derived expression.

The multiplicative model for combining isolation barriers is a standard and well-established framework (e.g., Coyne & Orr). The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and clear definitions to arrive at a unique solution. The language is objective and the setup is internally consistent. The problem is valid.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the expression for total reproductive isolation.\n\nLet $GT_{C}$ and $GT_{H}$ represent the expected gene transmission for conspecific and heterospecific crosses, respectively. The total reproductive isolation, $RI_{\\text{total}}$, is defined as:\n$$RI_{\\text{total}} = 1 - \\frac{GT_{H}}{GT_{C}}$$\nGene transmission is modeled as a product of probabilities through sequential, conditionally independent stages, multiplied by final adult fertility.\n\nLet the prezygotic stages be ecological co-occurrence ($E$), courtship acceptance ($C$), and gametic compatibility ($G$). The probability of forming a zygote is the product of the probabilities of passing these stages.\nFor a conspecific cross, the probability of forming a zygote, $P(Z_{C})$, is:\n$$P(Z_{C}) = P_{C}(E) \\times P_{C}(C|E) \\times P_{C}(G|C)$$\nFor a heterospecific cross, the probability of forming a zygote, $P(Z_{H})$, is:\n$$P(Z_{H}) = P_{H}(E) \\times P_{H}(C|E) \\times P_{H}(G|C)$$\nThe problem requires defining a prezygotic isolation index, $RI_{\\text{pre}}$, from first principles. We define it as the proportional reduction in zygote formation in heterospecific crosses relative to conspecific crosses:\n$$RI_{\\text{pre}} = 1 - \\frac{P(Z_{H})}{P(Z_{C})}$$\nFrom this definition, it follows that the ratio of zygote formation probabilities is $\\frac{P(Z_{H})}{P(Z_{C})} = 1 - RI_{\\text{pre}}$.\n\nNext, consider the postzygotic stages: survival to adulthood ($S$) and fertility ($F$). We can define an effective fitness contribution per zygote.\nFor a conspecific zygote, the effective fitness, $W_{C}$, is the product of its survival probability and the fertility of the resulting adult:\n$$W_{C} = P_{C}(S|\\text{zygote}) \\times F_{C}$$\nFor a hybrid zygote, the effective fitness, $W_{H}$, is:\n$$W_{H} = P_{H}(S|\\text{zygote}) \\times F_{H}$$\nThe postzygotic isolation index, $RI_{\\text{post}}$, is defined as the proportional reduction in the effective fitness of a hybrid zygote relative to a conspecific zygote:\n$$RI_{\\text{post}} = 1 - \\frac{W_{H}}{W_{C}}$$\nThis implies that the ratio of effective fitness is $\\frac{W_{H}}{W_{C}} = 1 - RI_{\\text{post}}$.\n\nThe total gene transmission is proportional to the probability of forming a zygote multiplied by the effective fitness of that zygote. Let the proportionality constant be $k$.\n$$GT_{C} = k \\times P(Z_{C}) \\times W_{C}$$\n$$GT_{H} = k \\times P(Z_{H}) \\times W_{H}$$\nSubstituting these into the formula for $RI_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$RI_{\\text{total}} = 1 - \\frac{k \\times P(Z_{H}) \\times W_{H}}{k \\times P(Z_{C}) \\times W_{C}} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{P(Z_{H})}{P(Z_{C})}\\right) \\left(\\frac{W_{H}}{W_{C}}\\right)$$\nNow, substituting the expressions for the isolation indices:\n$$RI_{\\text{total}} = 1 - (1 - RI_{\\text{pre}})(1 - RI_{\\text{post}})$$\nThis expression can be expanded to show the additive and interactive effects of the isolation components:\n$$RI_{\\text{total}} = 1 - (1 - RI_{\\text{post}} - RI_{\\text{pre}} + RI_{\\text{pre}}RI_{\\text{post}}) = RI_{\\text{pre}} + RI_{\\text{post}} - RI_{\\text{pre}}RI_{\\text{post}}$$\nThis is the required expression.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of isolation indices.\n\nFirst, we calculate the probabilities from the given data. Let $P(Z_C)$ be the probability of conspecific zygote formation and $P(Z_H)$ be the probability of heterospecific zygote formation.\n$$P(Z_C) = \\left(\\frac{620}{1000}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{372}{620}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{316}{372}\\right) = \\frac{316}{1000} = 0.316$$\n$$P(Z_H) = \\left(\\frac{217}{1000}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{52}{217}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{31}{52}\\right) = \\frac{31}{1000} = 0.031$$\nNow, we compute the prezygotic isolation index, $RI_{\\text{pre}}$:\n$$RI_{\\text{pre}} = 1 - \\frac{P(Z_H)}{P(Z_C)} = 1 - \\frac{0.031}{0.316} = 1 - \\frac{31}{316} = \\frac{316 - 31}{316} = \\frac{285}{316}$$\nNext, we compute the effective fitness for conspecific ($W_C$) and hybrid ($W_H$) zygotes.\n$$W_C = P_C(S|\\text{zygote}) \\times F_C = \\left(\\frac{930}{1500}\\right) \\times 4.8$$\n$$W_H = P_H(S|\\text{zygote}) \\times F_H = \\left(\\frac{558}{1500}\\right) \\times 2.4$$\nNow, we compute the postzygotic isolation index, $RI_{\\text{post}}$:\n$$RI_{\\text{post}} = 1 - \\frac{W_H}{W_C} = 1 - \\frac{\\left(\\frac{558}{1500}\\right) \\times 2.4}{\\left(\\frac{930}{1500}\\right) \\times 4.8} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{558}{930}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{2.4}{4.8}\\right)$$\nThe ratios simplify: $\\frac{558}{930} = 0.6$ and $\\frac{2.4}{4.8} = 0.5$.\n$$RI_{\\text{post}} = 1 - (0.6 \\times 0.5) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$$\nFinally, we compute the total reproductive isolation, $RI_{\\text{total}}$, using the derived formula:\n$$RI_{\\text{total}} = 1 - (1 - RI_{\\text{pre}})(1 - RI_{\\text{post}})$$\nThe term $(1 - RI_{\\text{pre}})$ is $\\frac{P(Z_H)}{P(Z_C)} = \\frac{31}{316}$.\nThe term $(1 - RI_{\\text{post}})$ is $\\frac{W_H}{W_C} = 0.3$.\n$$RI_{\\text{total}} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{31}{316}\\right) \\times 0.3 = 1 - \\frac{9.3}{316} = \\frac{316 - 9.3}{316} = \\frac{306.7}{316}$$\nAs a decimal, this is:\n$$RI_{\\text{total}} \\approx 0.97056962...$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we obtain $0.9706$.\nThe values for the intermediate indices are $RI_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{285}{316} \\approx 0.9019$ and $RI_{\\text{post}} = 0.7$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9706}$$", "id": "2841618"}, {"introduction": "While the previous exercise showed how to measure postzygotic isolation, this practice delves into the genetic mechanisms that cause it. Hybrid inviability and sterility often stem from negative interactions between genes from the two parent lineages, a concept formalized in the Dobzhansky–Muller model.

This will provide you with a concrete understanding of how hybrid breakdown, a cornerstone of the BSC, evolves at the level of individual genes and their interactions.", "problem": "A classical derivation of postzygotic isolation under the biological species concept (BSC) rests on how hybrid fitness is reduced by incompatibilities. The BSC holds that species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations that are reproductively isolated from other such groups. Consider two lineages that differ at two independent Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibilities (DMI), each involving a pair of loci with derived alleles that interact deleteriously when both are present in an individual. Suppose the two DMIs are dominant-by-dominant: the presence of at least one copy of each of the two derived alleles in a DMI pair is sufficient to express that incompatibility. For DMI $1$, the selection coefficient against individuals expressing the incompatibility is $s_1$, and for DMI $2$ it is $s_2$. Assume a multiplicative fitness model across independent effects: if an individual expresses a subset of incompatibilities $\\mathcal{I}$, its relative fitness is $\\prod_{i \\in \\mathcal{I}}(1 - s_i)$. Let parental genotypes be fixed for derived alleles in opposite lineages so that the first filial generation ($F_1$) produced by crossing the lineages is heterozygous at all four loci and expresses both DMIs. The second filial generation ($F_2$) arises by random mating among $F_1$s, with independent assortment and no linkage or additional epistasis beyond the two specified DMIs.\n\n1. Starting only from Mendelian segregation for biallelic loci (gametes from a heterozygote occur with probabilities $1/2$ for each allele) and independence across loci, derive the expected mean relative fitness of $F_1$ hybrids, $W_{\\mathrm{F1}}$, and the expected mean relative fitness of $F_2$ hybrids, $W_{\\mathrm{F2}}$, in terms of $s_1$ and $s_2$.\n\n2. Using $s_1 = 0.25$ and $s_2 = 0.4$, evaluate $W_{\\mathrm{F1}}$ and $W_{\\mathrm{F2}}$ numerically.\n\n3. Under the operational criterion that BSC-level postzygotic isolation is sufficient when the mean $F_1$ relative fitness falls below the critical threshold $F_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 0.5$, determine whether these values imply sufficient postzygotic isolation in this cross by computing the indicator $I_{\\mathrm{BSC}}$, defined as $I_{\\mathrm{BSC}} = 1$ if $W_{\\mathrm{F1}} < F_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ and $I_{\\mathrm{BSC}} = 0$ otherwise.\n\nProvide your final answer as a row matrix $\\big(W_{\\mathrm{F1}},\\, W_{\\mathrm{F2}},\\, I_{\\mathrm{BSC}}\\big)$. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The biological species concept (BSC) frames species boundaries in terms of reproductive isolation, which can be quantified through hybrid fitness. Under a multiplicative fitness model, independent deleterious effects on fitness combine as a product of their individual relative fitness terms. A selection coefficient $s$ for a particular incompatibility means that, when that incompatibility is expressed, relative fitness is multiplied by $(1 - s)$.\n\nWe consider two Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibilities (DMI 1 and DMI 2), each dominant-by-dominant: the presence of at least one copy of each derived allele in the pair is sufficient to express the incompatibility. The parental genotypes are fixed reciprocally for the derived alleles at each pair, producing $F_1$ offspring that are heterozygous at all relevant loci and therefore express both DMIs.\n\n1. Derivation of $W_{\\mathrm{F1}}$ and $W_{\\mathrm{F2}}$ in terms of $s_1$ and $s_2$:\n\n- $F_1$ hybrids: By construction, each $F_1$ individual carries at least one copy of each derived allele at both DMI pairs. Under dominant-by-dominant expression, both incompatibilities are expressed in every $F_1$ individual. With the multiplicative model, the $F_1$ relative fitness is therefore\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{F1}} = (1 - s_1)(1 - s_2).\n$$\n\n- $F_2$ hybrids: $F_2$ arise from random mating among $F_1$s, which are double heterozygotes at each DMI pair. Consider one DMI pair (for example, loci $A$ and $B$ for DMI 1). Each $F_1$ is $Aa$ at locus $A$ and $Bb$ at locus $B$. Gametes from a heterozygote contribute each allele with probability $1/2$, and independent assortment holds across loci. The probability an $F_2$ individual lacks the derived allele at $A$ (i.e., is $aa$) is $1/4$, and the probability it lacks the derived allele at $B$ (i.e., is $bb$) is also $1/4$. These events are independent across the two loci, so the probability an $F_2$ individual lacks at least one of the two derived alleles (and thus does not express the incompatibility) is\n$$\nP(\\text{no expression}) = P(aa \\ \\text{or}\\ bb) = P(aa) + P(bb) - P(aa \\ \\text{and}\\ bb) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{7}{16}.\n$$\nEquivalently, the probability that the DMI is expressed (at least one derived allele present at each locus) is\n$$\np \\equiv P(\\text{expression}) = 1 - \\frac{7}{16} = \\frac{9}{16}.\n$$\nBy the same reasoning, DMI 2 is expressed in an $F_2$ individual with probability $\\frac{9}{16}$. Because the two DMIs involve disjoint sets of loci and assort independently, the expression indicators for the two DMIs are independent Bernoulli random variables, $I_1$ and $I_2$, with parameter $p = \\frac{9}{16}$. The multiplicative fitness of an $F_2$ individual is $(1 - s_1)^{I_1}(1 - s_2)^{I_2}$. The expected mean relative fitness in $F_2$ is\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{F2}} = \\mathbb{E}\\left[(1 - s_1)^{I_1}(1 - s_2)^{I_2}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[(1 - s_1)^{I_1}\\right]\\mathbb{E}\\left[(1 - s_2)^{I_2}\\right],\n$$\nwhere independence justifies factorization. For a Bernoulli random variable $I$ with success probability $p$, $\\mathbb{E}[(1 - s)^{I}] = p(1 - s) + (1 - p)\\cdot 1 = 1 - p s$. Applying this to both DMIs gives\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{F2}} = \\left(1 - \\frac{9}{16} s_1\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{9}{16} s_2\\right).\n$$\n\nThus, in terms of $s_1$ and $s_2$,\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{F1}} = (1 - s_1)(1 - s_2), \\quad W_{\\mathrm{F2}} = \\left(1 - \\frac{9}{16} s_1\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{9}{16} s_2\\right).\n$$\n\n2.

Inference under the operational BSC criterion:\n\nThe criterion states that postzygotic isolation is sufficient when $W_{\\mathrm{F1}} < F_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ with $F_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 0.5$.

However, the biological species concept encompasses total reproductive isolation, which also depends on prezygotic barriers, ecological context, mating system, and the distribution of hybrid classes beyond $F_2$. Moreover, the use of a fixed threshold is an operational simplification; real populations experience migration–selection balance, linkage, and environment-dependent fitness that can alter the effectiveness of postzygotic barriers. Thus, while $I_{\\mathrm{BSC}} = 1$ under the stated criterion, this should be interpreted with these limitations in mind.\n\nThe requested final output is the row matrix $\\big(W_{\\mathrm{F1}},\\, W_{\\mathrm{F2}},\\, I_{\\mathrm{BSC}}\\big)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}\\frac{9}{20}  \\frac{341}{512}  1\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2841654"}, {"introduction": "Reproductive isolation is rarely an all-or-nothing phenomenon; often, it is a matter of degree.

Therefore, I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe solution begins by calculating the necessary population genetic parameters as requested.\nThe total number of individuals sampled is the sum of the subsample sizes:\n$$N = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} n_{i} = 50 + 60 + 55 = 165$$\n\nThe sample-size weights, $w_{i} = n_{i}/N$, for each deme are:\n$$w_{1} = \\frac{50}{165}, \\quad w_{2} = \\frac{60}{165}, \\quad w_{3} = \\frac{55}{165}$$\n\nUnder the assumption of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, the expected heterozygosity ($H_i$) for a biallelic locus in deme $i$ is given by $H_{i} = 2p_{i}q_{i}$, where $q_{i} = 1 - p_{i}$.\nFor deme $1$: $p_{1} = 0.80$, so $q_{1} = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$.\n$$H_{1} = 2(0.80)(0.20) = 0.32$$\nFor deme $2$: $p_{2} = 0.62$, so $q_{2} = 1 - 0.62 = 0.38$.\n$$H_{2} = 2(0.62)(0.38) = 0.4712$$\nFor deme $3$: $p_{3} = 0.85$, so $q_{3} = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$.\n$$H_{3} = 2(0.85)(0.15) = 0.255$$\n\nThe weighted average of the within-deme expected heterozygosities, $H_{S}$, is:\n$$H_{S} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_{i} H_{i} = \\frac{50}{165}(0.32) + \\frac{60}{165}(0.4712) + \\frac{55}{165}(0.255)$$\n$$H_{S} = \\frac{1}{165} [50(0.32) + 60(0.4712) + 55(0.255)] = \\frac{1}{165} [16 + 28.272 + 14.025] = \\frac{58.297}{165} \\approx 0.353315$$\n\nNext, the pooled allele frequency, $\\bar{p}$, for allele $A$ across the three demes is the weighted average of the individual deme frequencies:\n$$\\bar{p} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_{i} p_{i} = \\frac{50}{165}(0.80) + \\frac{60}{165}(0.62) + \\frac{55}{165}(0.85)$$\n$$\\bar{p} = \\frac{1}{165} [50(0.80) + 60(0.62) + 55(0.85)] = \\frac{1}{165} [40 + 37.2 + 46.75] = \\frac{123.95}{165} \\approx 0.751212$$\n\nThe total expected heterozygosity, $H_{T}$, is the expected heterozygosity in a hypothetical panmictic population with allele frequency $\\bar{p}$:\n$$H_{T} = 2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p}) = 2\\left(\\frac{123.95}{165}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{123.95}{165}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{123.95}{165}\\right)\\left(\\frac{41.05}{165}\\right) = \\frac{10176.295}{27225} \\approx 0.373783$$\n\nThe fixation index, $F_{ST}$, is calculated according to its definition as the proportional reduction in heterozygosity in subpopulations relative to the total population:\n$$F_{ST} = \\frac{H_{T} - H_{S}}{H_{T}} = 1 - \\frac{H_{S}}{H_{T}}$$\nSubstituting the computed values:\n$$F_{ST} = 1 - \\frac{0.353315}{0.373783} = 1 - 0.945241 = 0.054759$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $F_{ST} = 0.05476$.\n\nNow, for the critical discussion. The Biological Species Concept (BSC) defines species based on reproductive isolation. Complete isolation implies zero gene flow. We use the island model relationship to connect $F_{ST}$ to the effective number of migrants per generation, $N_{e}m$:\n$$F_{ST} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 4N_{e}m}$$\nFrom this, we can estimate $N_{e}m$:\n$$N_{e}m \\approx \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{1}{F_{ST}} - 1\\right)$$\nUsing our calculated $F_{ST} = 0.05476$:\n$$N_{e}m \\approx \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{1}{0.05476} - 1\\right) \\approx \\frac{1}{4}(18.2615 - 1) = \\frac{17.2615}{4} \\approx 4.3$$\nAn $N_{e}m$ value of approximately $4.3$ migrants per generation is substantial. The classical theory of drift-migration balance, primarily from Sewall Wright, posits a critical threshold at $N_{e}m = 1$.\n- If $N_{e}m \\gg 1$, gene flow is strong enough to overwhelm genetic drift, effectively homogenizing allele frequencies across demes. The populations behave as a single evolutionary unit.\n- If $N_{e}m  1$, genetic drift is the dominant force, leading to divergence of allele frequencies among demes. This is a necessary condition for populations to follow independent evolutionary trajectories, a prerequisite for speciation.\n\nFor groups to be considered separate species under the BSC, they must be reproductively isolated, meaning gene flow is negligible ($m \\approx 0$, so $N_{e}m \\approx 0$). An $N_{e}m$ value of $4.3$ is significantly greater than $1$, indicating that gene flow is a powerful force connecting these ecomorphs. This level of gene flow would prevent the genome-wide divergence expected between distinct species.\n\nConventionally, $F_{ST}$ values are interpreted as follows: $F_{ST}  0.05$ indicates little differentiation; $0.05  F_{ST}  0.15$ indicates moderate differentiation; and $F_{ST}  0.25$ indicates very great differentiation. Our calculated value of $F_{ST} \\approx 0.055$ falls into the \"moderate\" category. This is far from the level of differentiation expected for reproductively isolated sympatric species. For BSC-level isolation, one would demand a much higher $F_{ST}$ value, certainly greater than $0.25$ (which corresponds to $N_{e}m  0.75$), and likely much higher. The fact that these ecomorphs exist in sympatry makes the low $F_{ST}$ value even more telling. In the absence of geographic barriers, strong intrinsic reproductive barriers are required to prevent interbreeding. The observed $F_{ST}$ strongly suggests these barriers are weak or absent for this a neutral locus. The morphological differences among the ecomorphs might be maintained by strong divergent selection on a few specific genes, but the neutral background of the genome is clearly experiencing significant cohesion due to gene flow.\n\nIn conclusion, the calculated $F_{ST}$ and corresponding $N_{e}m$ values are not consistent with the hypothesis that these three ecomorphs represent separately evolving lineages under the strict definition of the Biological Species Concept. They appear to be components of a single, structured population.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.05476}$$", "id": "2841629"}]}
