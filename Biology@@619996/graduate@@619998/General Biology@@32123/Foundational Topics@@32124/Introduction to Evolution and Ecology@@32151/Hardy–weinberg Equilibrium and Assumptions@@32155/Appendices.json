It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in population genetics that is free of contradictions or ambiguities. It presents a classic scenario for analyzing the Wahlund effect. We will now proceed with a systematic solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part analysis of genotype data from two pooled subpopulations.

The frequency of allele $A$, denoted $p_{pool}$, and the frequency of allele $a$, denoted $q_{pool}$, are:\n$$p_{pool} = \\frac{2 N_{AA} + N_{Aa}}{2 n_{total}} = \\frac{2(70) + 78}{2(200)} = \\frac{140 + 78}{400} = \\frac{218}{400} = 0.545$$\n$$q_{pool} = \\frac{2 N_{aa} + N_{Aa}}{2 n_{total}} = \\frac{2(52) + 78}{2(200)} = \\frac{104 + 78}{400} = \\frac{182}{400} = 0.455$$\nAs required, $p_{pool} + q_{pool} = 0.545 + 0.455 = 1.0$.\n\nThe HWE-expected heterozygosity, $H_{\\text{exp}}$, for the pooled sample is given by:\n$$H_{\\text{exp}} = 2 p_{pool} q_{pool} = 2(0.545)(0.455) = 0.49595$$\n\n**Part 2: Estimation of the Heterozygote-Deficit Coefficient ($\\hat{F}$)**\n\nThe problem defines the inbreeding coefficient, $\\hat{F}$, based on the reduction in heterozygosity relative to the HWE expectation. This is the standard definition for Wright's $F$-statistic, $F_{IT}$, estimated for an individual relative to the total population.\n$$\\hat{F} = \\frac{H_{\\text{exp}} - H_{\\text{obs}}}{H_{\\text{exp}}}$$\nSubstituting the values calculated in Part 1:\n$$\\hat{F} = \\frac{0.49595 - 0.39}{0.49595} = \\frac{0.10595}{0.49595} \\approx 0.21362637...$$\nThe estimated heterozygote-deficit coefficient for the pooled sample is approximately $0.2136$.\n\n**Part 3: Evaluation of the Source of the Deficit**\n\nThe observed value $\\hat{F} > 0$ indicates a deficit of heterozygotes compared to the HWE prediction for the pooled population. The problem asks whether this deficit can be explained solely by the pooling of samples from two distinct subpopulations (the Wahlund effect), which assumes each subpopulation is itself in HWE.\n\nTo investigate this, we must first determine the allele frequencies within each fragment.\n\nFor Fragment $1$ ($n_1 = 120$):\n$$p_1 = \\frac{2 n_{AA}^{(1)} + n_{Aa}^{(1)}}{2 n_1} = \\frac{2(60) + 48}{2(120)} = \\frac{168}{240} = 0.7$$\n$$q_1 = 1 - p_1 = 0.3$$\n\nFor Fragment $2$ ($n_2 = 80$):\n$$p_2 = \\frac{2 n_{AA}^{(2)} + n_{Aa}^{(2)}}{2 n_2} = \\frac{2(10) + 30}{2(80)} = \\frac{50}{160} = 0.3125$$\n$$q_2 = 1 - p_2 = 0.6875$$\nThe allele frequencies ($p_1=0.7$, $p_2=0.3125$) are substantially different, which is the necessary condition for the Wahlund effect.\n\nThe problem assumes random mating within fragments. Under this assumption, the expected heterozygosity within each fragment is $H_{\\text{exp}}^{(1)} = 2 p_1 q_1$ and $H_{\\text{exp}}^{(2)} = 2 p_2 q_2$. The expected heterozygosity for the total population, accounting for its subdivision, is the weighted average of the within-fragment heterozygosities. This quantity is denoted $H_S$. The weights $w_1$ and $w_2$ are the sampling proportions:\n$w_1 = \\frac{n_1}{n_{total}} = \\frac{120}{200} = 0.6$\n$w_2 = \\frac{n_2}{n_{total}} = \\frac{80}{200} = 0.4$\n\nThe expected heterozygosity in a structured population made of HWE subpopulations is:\n$$H_S = w_1 (2 p_1 q_1) + w_2 (2 p_2 q_2)$$\n$$H_S = 0.6 \\times (2 \\times 0.7 \\times 0.3) + 0.4 \\times (2 \\times 0.3125 \\times 0.6875)$$\n$$H_S = 0.6 \\times (0.42) + 0.4 \\times (0.4296875)$$\n$$H_S = 0.252 + 0.171875 = 0.423875$$\nThis value, $H_S$, represents the expected frequency of heterozygotes in the pooled sample if the only factor causing a deviation from the total HWE expectation ($H_{\\text{exp}} = H_T = 0.49595$) is the population structure, and no inbreeding occurs within fragments.\n\nThe portion of the total heterozygote deficit attributable to population structure is quantified by the fixation index $F_{ST}$:\n$$F_{ST} = \\frac{H_T - H_S}{H_T} = \\frac{0.49595 - 0.423875}{0.49595} = \\frac{0.072075}{0.49595} \\approx 0.1453$$\n\nHowever, the actual observed heterozygosity is $H_{\\text{obs}} = 0.39$. This value is less than the heterozygosity expected even under the structured model ($H_S = 0.423875$). This indicates an additional deficit of heterozygotes that is not explained by the Wahlund effect alone. This further deficit arises from an apparent deviation from HWE within the subpopulations themselves. The inbreeding coefficient describing this within-subpopulation deficit is $F_{IS}$:\n$$F_{IS} = \\frac{H_S - H_{\\text{obs}}}{H_S} = \\frac{0.423875 - 0.39}{0.423875} = \\frac{0.033875}{0.423875} \\approx 0.0799$$\n\nThe total inbreeding coefficient, $F_{IT}$ (which we estimated as $\\hat{F}$), is related to $F_{ST}$ and $F_{IS}$ by the equation $(1-F_{IT})=(1-F_{IS})(1-F_{ST})$. Using our computed values:\n$1 - F_{IT} \\approx (1 - 0.0799)(1 - 0.1453) \\approx (0.9201)(0.8547) \\approx 0.7863$\nThis implies $F_{IT} \\approx 1 - 0.7863 = 0.2137$, which is consistent with our direct calculation of $\\hat{F} \\approx 0.2136$.\n\nConclusion: The estimated heterozygote-deficit coefficient for the pooled sample is $\\hat{F} \\approx 0.2136$. The component of this deficit attributable solely to the sampling design (pooling across fragments, i.e., the Wahlund effect) is $F_{ST} \\approx 0.1453$. Since $\\hat{F} > F_{ST}$, the sampling design alone is not sufficient to explain the total observed deficit. An additional component, $F_{IS} \\approx 0.0799$, must be invoked, which indicates a systematic heterozygote deficit within the fragments, likely due to some level of inbreeding or other unmodeled substructure.\n\nThe final numerical answer required is the estimated $\\hat{F}$ for the pooled sample, rounded to four significant figures.\n$\\hat{F} = 0.2136$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2136}$$", "id": "2804188"}]}
