Consider a single biallelic locus with alleles $A$ and $a$. Two large subpopulations, $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$, each undergo random mating and are individually at HWE with allele $A$ frequencies $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$, respectively. A pooled sample is formed by drawing a fraction $w_{1}$ of individuals from $S_{1}$ and a fraction $w_{2}$ from $S_{2}$, with $w_{1}+w_{2}=1$, without mating among subpopulations prior to sampling.\n\n- Briefly explain why pooling such subpopulations can lead to a deficit of heterozygotes (the Wahlund effect) even when each subpopulation is at HWE.\n\n- Starting only from the definitions of allele frequency, genotype frequency under HWE, and heterozygosity (defined here as the expected heterozygote frequency), derive the expected heterozygote deficit caused by pooling.

It represents a classic scenario in population genetics known as the Wahlund effect. All necessary definitions and constraints are provided, permitting a rigorous mathematical derivation. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nWe will first address the conceptual explanation and then proceed with the formal derivation.\n\nThe Wahlund effect describes the reduction in heterozygosity (and corresponding increase in homozygosity) observed when a population is composed of two or more distinct subpopulations that do not interbreed. Even if each subpopulation is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), the pooled population as a whole will exhibit a deficit of heterozygotes compared to the HWE expectation based on its overall allele frequencies.\n\nThe fundamental reason for this phenomenon lies in the non-linear relationship between allele frequency and expected heterozygote frequency. The frequency of heterozygotes under HWE is given by the function $H(p) = 2p(1-p)$, where $p$ is the allele frequency of interest. This function is a downward-opening parabola, which mathematically is a strictly concave function for $p \\in (0,1)$. For any concave function $f(x)$, Jensen's inequality states that for a set of points $x_i$ and corresponding weights $w_i$ such that $\\sum w_i = 1$, the following holds:\n$$\n\\sum_{i} w_i f(x_i) \\leq f\\left(\\sum_{i} w_i x_i\\right)\n$$\nIn our context, $x_i$ are the allele frequencies $p_1$ and $p_2$, and the weights are the subpopulation contributions $w_1$ and $w_2$. The left side of the inequality, $\\sum w_i H(p_i) = w_1 H(p_1) + w_2 H(p_2)$, represents the actual, observed average heterozygosity in the pooled sample, as it is the weighted average of the HWE heterozygosities from each subpopulation. The right side, $H(\\sum w_i p_i) = H(w_1 p_1 + w_2 p_2) = H(\\bar{p})$, represents the theoretical heterozygosity expected if the entire population were panmictic with the pooled allele frequency $\\bar{p}$.\n\nThus, Jensen's inequality directly implies:\n$$\nH_{\\text{observed in pooled sample}} \\leq H_{\\text{HWE at } \\bar{p}}\n$$\nEquality holds only if the allele frequencies in the subpopulations are identical ($p_1 = p_2$). If $p_1 \\neq p_2$, a strict inequality holds, signifying a deficit of heterozygotes. Intuitively, an excess of homozygotes is created because individuals are more likely to be homozygous for the allele that is common in their native subpopulation ($AA$ in a high-$p$ subpopulation, $aa$ in a low-$p$ subpopulation). When these pre-existing sets of genotypes are combined without mixing, the total count of homozygotes exceeds what would be predicted from random mating across the entire pooled gene pool.\n\nNow, we proceed with the formal derivation of the heterozygote deficit, $D$.\n\nLet the frequencies of allele $A$ in subpopulations $S_1$ and $S_2$ be $p_1$ and $p_2$, respectively. The frequencies of allele $a$ are correspondingly $q_1 = 1-p_1$ and $q_2 = 1-p_2$.\nThe fractions of individuals drawn from $S_1$ and $S_2$ are $w_1$ and $w_2$, with the constraint $w_1 + w_2 = 1$.\n\nFirst, we determine the observed frequency of heterozygotes ($Aa$) in the pooled sample, which we denote as $H_{\\text{obs}}$. Since each subpopulation is at HWE, the frequency of heterozygotes in $S_1$ is $H_1 = 2p_1q_1$ and in $S_2$ is $H_2 = 2p_2q_2$. The pooled heterozygote frequency is the weighted average of these frequencies:\n$$\nH_{\\text{obs}} = w_1 H_1 + w_2 H_2 = w_1(2p_1q_1) + w_2(2p_2q_2) = 2w_1p_1(1-p_1) + 2w_2p_2(1-p_2)\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the heterozygote frequency that would be expected if the pooled population were a single, panmictic unit at HWE. This requires calculating the average allele frequency, $\\bar{p}$, in the pooled sample.\nThe average frequency of allele $A$ is the weighted average of the allele frequencies in the subpopulations:\n$$\n\\bar{p} = w_1 p_1 + w_2 p_2\n$$\nThe average frequency of allele $a$ is $\\bar{q} = 1 - \\bar{p}$.\nThe expected heterozygote frequency under HWE for this pooled allele frequency, $H_{\\text{exp}}$, is:\n$$\nH_{\\text{exp}} = 2\\bar{p}\\bar{q} = 2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p}) = 2(w_1 p_1 + w_2 p_2)(1 - (w_1 p_1 + w_2 p_2))\n$$\n\nThe heterozygote deficit, $D$, is defined as $D \\equiv H_{\\text{exp}} - H_{\\text{obs}}$.\n$$\nD = 2(w_1 p_1 + w_2 p_2)(1 - w_1 p_1 - w_2 p_2) - \\left[ 2w_1p_1(1-p_1) + 2w_2p_2(1-p_2) \\right]\n$$\nFor simplicity, we can work with $D/2$:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{2} = (w_1 p_1 + w_2 p_2)(1 - w_1 p_1 - w_2 p_2) - [w_1p_1(1-p_1) + w_2p_2(1-p_2)]\n$$\nExpand the terms:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{2} = (w_1p_1 + w_2p_2) - (w_1p_1 + w_2p_2)^2 - (w_1p_1 - w_1p_1^2) - (w_2p_2 - w_2p_2^2)\n$$\nThe linear terms cancel out: $(w_1p_1 + w_2p_2) - w_1p_1 - w_2p_2 = 0$.\n$$\n\\frac{D}{2} = -(w_1p_1 + w_2p_2)^2 + w_1p_1^2 + w_2p_2^2\n$$\nExpand the squared binomial:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{2} = -(w_1^2p_1^2 + 2w_1w_2p_1p_2 + w_2^2p_2^2) + w_1p_1^2 + w_2p_2^2\n$$\nRearrange the terms:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{2} = (w_1p_1^2 - w_1^2p_1^2) + (w_2p_2^2 - w_2^2p_2^2) - 2w_1w_2p_1p_2\n$$\nFactor out $w_1p_1^2$ and $w_2p_2^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{2} = w_1p_1^2(1-w_1) + w_2p_2^2(1-w_2) - 2w_1w_2p_1p_2\n$$\nUsing the constraint $w_1+w_2=1$, we have $1-w_1=w_2$ and $1-w_2=w_1$. Substitute these into the expression:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{2} = w_1p_1^2(w_2) + w_2p_2^2(w_1) - 2w_1w_2p_1p_2\n$$\nFactor out the common term $w_1w_2$:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{2} = w_1w_2 (p_1^2 + p_2^2 - 2p_1p_2)\n$$\nThe term in the parenthesis is a perfect square, $(p_1-p_2)^2$.\n$$\n\\frac{D}{2} = w_1w_2 (p_1 - p_2)^2\n$$\nFinally, multiply by $2$ to find the expression for $D$:\n$$\nD = 2w_1w_2(p_1 - p_2)^2\n$$\nThis expression demonstrates that the deficit $D$ is always non-negative, as $w_1, w_2\n\\ge 0$ and $(p_1-p_2)^2 \\ge 0$. The deficit is zero only if $p_1=p_2$ (no genetic differentiation) or if one of the subpopulations is not sampled (e.g., $w_1=0$ or $w_2=0$). The deficit is proportional to the product of the subpopulation weights and the squared difference of their allele frequencies.

The solution process may proceed.\n\nThe solution requires two stages: first, the derivation of the coefficients of relatedness, and second, the calculation of the net inclusive fitness change, $\\Delta W$.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of Coefficients of Relatedness ($r$)\nThe coefficient of relatedness, $r$, between two individuals is the probability that a randomly chosen allele in one individual is identical by descent (IBD) to a randomly chosen allele in the other. We use pedigree analysis for a haplodiploid system with a polyandrous queen ($n=3$ mates).\n\n1. Relatedness of a worker to her son ($r_{\\text{w}\\to\\text{son}}$):\nA worker is a diploid female. Her son develops from an unfertilized egg, making him haploid. His entire genome is a random meiotic sample of his mother's genome. If we select a random allele from the son, it necessarily came from the mother. The probability that this allele is IBD with a randomly chosen allele from the mother (of which there are two, one from each of her chromosome sets) is $1/2$.\nTherefore,\n$$r_{\\text{w}\\to\\text{son}} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\n2. Relatedness of a worker to her brother ($r_{\\text{w}\\to\\text{bro}}$):\nA worker (female, diploid) and her brother (male, haploid) share the same mother (the queen) but the brother has no father. The brother's haploid genome is derived from one of the queen's two sets of chromosomes. The worker's diploid genome consists of one set from the queen and one set from her father.\nTo find the relatedness, we consider the probability that a random allele from the worker is IBD with the single homologous allele in her brother. A random allele from the worker has a $1/2$ probability of originating from the queen. If it did, there is a $1/2$ probability it is the same allele the brother inherited from the queen. The other $1/2$ probability for the worker's allele is that it came from her father. Since the brother has no father, there is no path for gene sharing through the paternal line.\nThe total relatedness is the sum of probabilities over all paths of descent:\n$$r_{\\text{w}\\to\\text{bro}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)_{\\text{path via mother}} \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)_{\\text{IBD from mother}} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)_{\\text{path via father}} \\times (0)_{\\text{IBD from father}} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nThis value is independent of the number of queen's mates.\n\n3. Relatedness of a worker to her sister ($r_{\\text{w}\\to\\text{sis}}$):\nTwo sisters are both diploid and share the same mother. They may have the same or different fathers, as the queen mated with $n=3$ males. The relatedness is the average of the relatedness through the maternal and paternal lines.\nRelatedness is calculated as $r = \\frac{1}{2} P_{\\text{maternal}} + \\frac{1}{2} P_{\\text{paternal}}$, where $P$ is the probability that alleles from a given parent are IBD in the offspring.\n- Maternal side: The two sisters share a diploid mother. The probability they inherit the same allele from their mother is $1/2$. Thus, $P_{\\text{maternal}} = 1/2$.\n- Paternal side: The probability that two sisters have the same father is $1/n$. Since fathers are haploid, if they share a father, the paternal alleles they inherit are identical ($P=1$). The probability they have different fathers is $(n-1)/n$. Assuming no inbreeding, different fathers are unrelated, so the probability of inheriting IBD alleles is $0$. The average probability of IBD through the paternal line is:\n$$P_{\\text{paternal}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right) \\times 1 + \\left(\\frac{n-1}{n}\\right) \\times 0 = \\frac{1}{n}$$\nCombining these, the average relatedness between sisters is:\n$$r_{\\text{w}\\to\\text{sis}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2n}$$\nGiven $n=3$:\n$$r_{\\text{w}\\to\\text{sis}} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2(3)} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{3}{12} + \\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{5}{12}$$\n\nPart 2: Calculation of Net Inclusive Fitness Change ($\\Delta W$)\nWe are given the formula for the net inclusive fitness change of helping versus reproducing:\n$$\\Delta W = r_{\\text{w}\\to\\text{sis}}\\,b_f + r_{\\text{w}\\to\\text{bro}}\\,b_m - r_{\\text{w}\\to\\text{son}}\\,(l\\,u)$$\nThe parameters are:\n- $r_{\\text{w}\\to\\text{sis}} = 5/12$\n- $r_{\\text{w}\\to\\text{bro}} = 1/4$\n- $r_{\\text{w}\\to\\text{son}} = 1/2$\n- $b_f = 0.5 = 1/2$\n- $b_m = 0.1 = 1/10$\n- $l = 2$\n- $u = 0.3 = 3/10$\n\nThe cost term is the expected number of surviving sons for the worker, which is $l \\times u = 2 \\times 3/10 = 6/10 = 3/5$.\nSubstitute the values into the equation for $\\Delta W$:\n$$\\Delta W = \\left(\\frac{5}{12}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\left(2 \\times \\frac{3}{10}\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta W = \\frac{5}{24} + \\frac{1}{40} - \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{6}{10}\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta W = \\frac{5}{24} + \\frac{1}{40} - \\frac{3}{10}$$\nTo sum these fractions, we find a common denominator.
