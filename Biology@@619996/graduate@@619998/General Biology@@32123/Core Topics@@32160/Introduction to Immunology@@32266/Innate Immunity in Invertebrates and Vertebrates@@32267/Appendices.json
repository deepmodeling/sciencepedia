We rearrange the equation:\n$$K_{D} [RL] = (R_{T} - [RL])[L]$$\n$$K_{D} [RL] = R_{T}[L] - [RL][L]$$\n$$K_{D} [RL] + [RL][L] = R_{T}[L]$$\nFactor out $[RL]$ from the left-hand side:\n$$[RL] (K_{D} + [L]) = R_{T}[L]$$\nIsolate $[RL]$:\n$$[RL] = \\frac{R_{T}[L]}{K_{D} + [L]}$$\nNow, we can compute the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ by dividing by the total receptor concentration $R_{T}$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{R_{T}} = \\frac{1}{R_{T}} \\left( \\frac{R_{T}[L]}{K_{D} + [L]} \\right)$$\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_{D} + [L]}$$\nThis is the well-known Hill-Langmuir equation for non-cooperative binding (Hill coefficient of $1$).\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of Active Adaptor Fraction, $f_{A}$, and Explanation of Ultrasensitivity**\n\nWe are given the relationships for the downstream signaling module:\n$$K_{a} = \\frac{[A]}{[X]\\; s^{n}}$$\n$$[X]_{T} = [X] + [A]$$\nWe are also told to identify $s$ with $\\theta$, so $s=\\theta$. The objective is to derive the active fraction $f_{A} = \\frac{[A]}{[X]_{T}}$ as a function of $\\theta$, $n$, and $K_{a}$.\n\nFrom the adaptor conservation equation, we express the concentration of free adaptor $[X]$:\n$$[X] = [X]_{T} - [A]$$\nSubstitute this into the expression for $K_{a}$, replacing $s$ with $\\theta$:\n$$K_{a} = \\frac{[A]}{([X]_{T} - [A])\\; \\theta^{n}}$$\nNow, we solve for the concentration of active adaptor, $[A]$:\n$$K_{a} ([X]_{T} - [A]) \\theta^{n} = [A]$$\n$$K_{a} [X]_{T} \\theta^{n} - K_{a} [A] \\theta^{n} = [A]$$\n$$K_{a} [X]_{T} \\theta^{n} = [A] + K_{a} [A] \\theta^{n}$$\nFactor out $[A]$ from the right-hand side:\n$$K_{a} [X]_{T} \\theta^{n} = [A] (1 + K_{a} \\theta^{n})$$\nIsolate $[A]$:\n$$[A] = \\frac{K_{a} [X]_{T} \\theta^{n}}{1 + K_{a} \\theta^{n}}$$\nFinally, we compute the active fraction $f_{A}$ by dividing by the total adaptor concentration $[X]_{T}$:\n$$f_{A} = \\frac{[A]}{[X]_{T}} = \\frac{1}{[X]_{T}} \\left( \\frac{K_{a} [X]_{T} \\theta^{n}}{1 + K_{a} \\theta^{n}} \\right)$$\n$$f_{A} = \\frac{K_{a} \\theta^{n}}{1 + K_{a} \\theta^{n}}$$\nThis is a Hill equation with Hill coefficient $n$, relating the output $f_A$ to the input $\\theta$.\n\nExplanation of ultrasensitivity:\nThe fractional receptor occupancy $\\theta$ is a hyperbolic function of the ligand concentration $[L]$, representing a graded, smooth response. However, the derived expression for the active adaptor fraction, $f_{A}$, has the input $\\theta$ raised to the power of $n$. For $n>1$, this function exhibits a sigmoidal, switch-like behavior. This is known as ultrasensitivity. The response $f_{A}$ is very low for small values of $\\theta$, but it increases sharply over a narrow range of $\\theta$ values. This is because the activation of $X$ requires the cooperative assembly of $n$ ligand-bound receptors. The probability of forming such an $n$-mer complex is proportional to $\\theta^{n}$. If $n$ is large, this term remains close to zero until $\\theta$ approaches a critical threshold, at which point it rises steeply. This non-linear amplification transforms the smooth input signal ($\\theta$) into a sharp, threshold-like output signal ($f_{A}$), allowing the cell to make a more decisive, \"all-or-none\" response to a change in ligand concentration. The steepness of this switch is controlled by the cooperativity parameter $n$.\n\n**Part 3: Derivation of Ligand Concentration $[L]_{p}$**\n\nThe objective is to solve for the ligand concentration $[L]_{p}$ that results in a specified active fraction $f_{A} = p$, where $p \\in (0,1)$. This requires a two-step inversion.\n\nFirst, we find the receptor occupancy $\\theta_{p}$ that yields $f_{A} = p$. We set the expression from Part 2 equal to $p$:\n$$p = \\frac{K_{a} \\theta_{p}^{n}}{1 + K_{a} \\theta_{p}^{n}}$$\nWe solve for $\\theta_{p}$:\n$$p(1 + K_{a} \\theta_{p}^{n}) = K_{a} \\theta_{p}^{n}$$\n$$p + p K_{a} \\theta_{p}^{n} = K_{a} \\theta_{p}^{n}$$\n$$p = K_{a} \\theta_{p}^{n} - p K_{a} \\theta_{p}^{n}$$\n$$p = K_{a} \\theta_{p}^{n} (1 - p)$$\n$$\\theta_{p}^{n} = \\frac{p}{K_{a}(1-p)}$$\nTaking the $n$-th root gives $\\theta_{p}$:\n$$\\theta_{p} = \\left( \\frac{p}{K_{a}(1-p)} \\right)^{1/n}$$\nSecond, we find the ligand concentration $[L]_{p}$ that produces this occupancy $\\theta_{p}$. We use the expression from Part 1, setting $\\theta = \\theta_{p}$ and $[L] = [L]_{p}$:\n$$\\theta_{p} = \\frac{[L]_{p}}{K_{D} + [L]_{p}}$$\nWe solve for $[L]_{p}$:\n$$\\theta_{p} (K_{D} + [L]_{p}) = [L]_{p}$$\n$$\\theta_{p} K_{D} + \\theta_{p} [L]_{p} = [L]_{p}$$\n$$\\theta_{p} K_{D} = [L]_{p} - \\theta_{p} [L]_{p}$$\n$$\\theta_{p} K_{D} = [L]_{p} (1 - \\theta_{p})$$\n$$[L]_{p} = K_{D} \\frac{\\theta_{p}}{1 - \\theta_{p}}$$\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $\\theta_{p}$ into this equation to obtain the final answer in terms of the given parameters:\n$$[L]_{p} = K_{D} \\frac{\\left( \\frac{p}{K_{a}(1-p)} \\right)^{1/n}}{1 - \\left( \\frac{p}{K_{a}(1-p)} \\right)^{1/n}}$$\nThis formula provides the required ligand concentration $[L]_{p}$ to achieve an activation level $p$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\nK_{D} \\frac{\\left( \\frac{p}{K_{a}(1-p)} \\right)^{1/n}}{1 - \\left( \\frac{p}{K_{a}(1-p)} \\right)^{1/n}}\n}\n$$", "id": "2809547"}, {"introduction": "The innate immune system must solve a fundamental problem of self versus non-self discrimination, unleashing powerful destructive mechanisms against pathogens while sparing host tissues.

For a system $\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\lambda x + b$, the steady state is stable if the eigenvalue $\\lambda < 0$. In our case, the effective eigenvalue is the coefficient of the $C(t)$ term, $\\lambda = \\alpha - \\delta - \\gamma H$.\nFor stability, we require $\\lambda < 0$:\n$$\n\\alpha - \\delta - \\gamma H < 0\n$$\nThis is equivalent to:\n$$\n\\alpha < \\delta + \\gamma H\n$$\nThis condition expresses that the per-capita rate of positive feedback ($\\alpha$) must be strictly less than the total per-capita rate of removal ($\\delta + \\gamma H$).

The cost is therefore $1 \\cdot L_{\\text{nt}} = L_{\\text{nt}}$.\n$2$. $5^{\\prime}$ Capping: Each mRNA molecule is modified with a $5^{\\prime}$ cap, a process that consumes one GTP molecule, counted as $1$ ATP equivalent.\n$3$. Polyadenylation: A poly(A) tail of length $A$ is added to the $3^{\\prime}$ end. This involves the polymerization of $A$ adenosine monophosphates from $A$ ATP molecules, costing $A$ ATP equivalents.\nSumming these components, the total ATP cost per mRNA molecule is:\n$$E_{\\text{mRNA}} = L_{\\text{nt}} + 1 + A$$\n\nNext, we derive the energy cost to synthesize a single protein molecule, which we denote as $E_{\\text{protein}}$. The protein has a length of $L_{\\text{aa}}$ amino acids. The problem specifies two major costs:\n$1$. Aminoacyl-tRNA Charging: Before an amino acid can be incorporated into a polypeptide, it must be attached to its corresponding tRNA. This activation step consumes one ATP, which is hydrolyzed to AMP and pyrophosphate, a reaction counted as $2$ ATP equivalents. For a protein of $L_{\\text{aa}}$ amino acids, this must be done for each amino acid. The total charging cost is $2 \\cdot L_{\\text{aa}}$.\n$2$. Translation Elongation: The problem states that the incorporation of each amino acid during elongation consumes two GTP molecules, counted as $2$ ATP equivalents per amino acid. For a protein of $L_{\\text{aa}}$ amino acids, the total elongation cost is $2 \\cdot L_{\\text{aa}}$.\nSumming these two components, the total ATP cost per protein molecule is:\n$$E_{\\text{protein}} = (2 \\cdot L_{\\text{aa}}) + (2 \\cdot L_{\\text{aa}}) = 4 \\cdot L_{\\text{aa}}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the total energy expenditure per cell, $E_{\\text{total}}$, by scaling these single-molecule costs to the entire ISG program. The program consists of $N_{\\text{ISG}}$ genes, each induced to a steady-state level of $c$ mRNA copies.\nThe total number of mRNA molecules synthesized, $N_{\\text{mRNA\\_total}}$, is:\n$$N_{\\text{mRNA\\_total}} = N_{\\text{ISG}} \\cdot c$$\nThe total cost of transcription for the entire program, $E_{\\text{transcription\\_total}}$, is the product of the number of mRNA molecules and the cost per molecule:\n$$E_{\\text{transcription\\_total}} = N_{\\text{mRNA\\_total}} \\cdot E_{\\text{mRNA}} = (N_{\\text{ISG}} \\cdot c) \\cdot (L_{\\text{nt}} + A + 1)$$\n\nEach of these mRNA molecules is translated an average of $r$ times. Therefore, the total number of protein molecules synthesized, $N_{\\text{protein\\_total}}$, is:\n$$N_{\\text{protein\\_total}} = N_{\\text{mRNA\\_total}} \\cdot r = N_{\\text{ISG}} \\cdot c \\cdot r$$\nThe total cost of translation for the entire program, $E_{\\text{translation\\_total}}$, is the product of the number of protein molecules and the cost per molecule:\n$$E_{\\text{translation\\_total}} = N_{\\text{protein\\_total}} \\cdot E_{\\text{protein}} = (N_{\\text{ISG}} \\cdot c \\cdot r) \\cdot (4 \\cdot L_{\\text{aa}})$$\n\nThe total ATP expenditure per cell is the sum of the total transcription and translation costs:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = E_{\\text{transcription\\_total}} + E_{\\text{translation\\_total}}$$\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = (N_{\\text{ISG}} \\cdot c \\cdot (L_{\\text{nt}} + A + 1)) + (N_{\\text{ISG}} \\cdot c \\cdot r \\cdot 4 \\cdot L_{\\text{aa}})$$\nFactoring out the common term $N_{\\text{ISG}} \\cdot c$, we arrive at the general expression for the total ATP equivalents expended per cell:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = N_{\\text{ISG}} \\cdot c \\cdot [(L_{\\text{nt}} + A + 1) + 4 \\cdot r \\cdot L_{\\text{aa}}]$$\n\nThis expression completes the first part of the task. For the second part, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n- $N_{\\text{ISG}} = 150$\n- $c = 40$\n- $L_{\\text{nt}} = 1500$\n- $A = 200$\n- $L_{\\text{aa}} = 400$\n- $r = 300$\n\nWe calculate the terms within the brackets first.\nThe transcription-related cost per gene copy:\n$$L_{\\text{nt}} + A + 1 = 1500 + 200 + 1 = 1701$$\nThe translation-related cost per gene copy:\n$$4 \\cdot r \\cdot L_{\\text{aa}} = 4 \\cdot 300 \\cdot 400 = 1200 \\cdot 400 = 480000$$\nThe total cost per gene copy is the sum:\n$$1701 + 480000 = 481701$$\nNow, we multiply by the number of copies per gene, $c$, and the number of genes, $N_{\\text{ISG}}$:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = (150 \\cdot 40) \\cdot 481701$$\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = 6000 \\cdot 481701$$\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = 2890206000$$\nThis is the total number of ATP equivalents expended per cell. The problem requires the answer to be expressed in scientific notation rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = 2.890206 \\times 10^9 \\approx 2.89 \\times 10^9$$\nThis is the final numerical answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.89 \\times 10^{9}}$$", "id": "2809560"}]}
