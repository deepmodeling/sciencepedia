The context, allele nomenclature, and biological assumptions are correct and standard in the field.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data (allele frequencies) and a clear, standard definition for the quantity to be calculated. The request for a conceptual justification is also well-defined.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in objective, scientific language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically sound, complete, and unambiguous. A solution is therefore warranted.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe problem requires the computation of expected heterozygosity, $H_e$, for a multi-allelic locus in a population at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. The definition provided is \"the probability that two alleles sampled at random from the gene pool are different.\" This is a standard definition.\n\nLet there be $k$ alleles at a locus, with frequencies $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$, such that $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i = 1$. The probability of randomly drawing a specific allele $i$ from the gene pool is $p_i$. Under the assumption of random sampling with replacement (appropriate for a large population), the probability of drawing the same allele $i$ twice is $p_i \\times p_i = p_i^2$.\n\nThe total probability of drawing two identical alleles, which corresponds to the expected frequency of homozygotes in the population ($H_o$), is the sum of these probabilities over all alleles:\n$$H_o = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i^2$$\nThe expected heterozygosity, $H_e$, is the complementary probability—that is, the probability that the two randomly drawn alleles are different. This is given by:\n$$H_e = 1 - H_o = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i^2$$\nIn this specific problem, there are $k=10$ alleles. We must compute the sum of the squares of the provided allele frequencies.\nLet the frequencies be $p_1 = 0.12$, $p_2 = 0.11$, $p_3 = 0.10$, $p_4 = 0.09$, $p_5 = 0.08$, $p_6 = 0.07$, $p_7 = 0.06$, $p_8 = 0.05$, $p_9 = 0.04$, and $p_{10} = 0.28$.\n\nThe sum of squared frequencies is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{10} p_i^2 = (0.12)^2 + (0.11)^2 + (0.10)^2 + (0.09)^2 + (0.08)^2 + (0.07)^2 + (0.06)^2 + (0.05)^2 + (0.04)^2 + (0.28)^2 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{10} p_i^2 = 0.0144 + 0.0121 + 0.0100 + 0.0081 + 0.0064 + 0.0049 + 0.0036 + 0.0025 + 0.0016 + 0.0784 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{10} p_i^2 = 0.1420 $$\nNow, the expected heterozygosity $H_e$ is calculated:\n$$ H_e = 1 - 0.1420 = 0.8580 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.8580$ is already in this form.\n\n**Justification of Biological Implication**\nThe second part of the problem requires a justification of what a high or low value of $H_e$ implies for pathogen recognition at the population level, based on first principles.\n\n1.  **MHC Function:** MHC class I molecules, such as HLA-B, are cell-surface proteins that bind and present short peptide fragments derived from intracellular proteins to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Each distinct MHC allele product has a specific three-dimensional structure, which determines the set of peptides it can bind (its binding repertoire).\n2.  **Co-dominant Expression:** As stated, HLA genes are co-dominantly expressed. This means a diploid individual who is heterozygous at the HLA-B locus (e.g., carrying alleles B*07:02 and B*08:01) expresses both molecule types on their cells. Consequently, this individual can present a broader range of peptides than a homozygous individual, who expresses only one type of HLA-B molecule. A broader presentation repertoire increases the probability of mounting an effective T-cell response against a given pathogen, such as a virus.\n3.  **Population-level Implication:** The expected heterozygosity, $H_e$, represents the expected proportion of heterozygous individuals in the population. A **high** $H_e$ (the calculated value of $0.8580$ is very high) signifies extensive allelic diversity at the MHC locus within the population. This genetic diversity is critical for population-level immunity. It ensures that for almost any pathogen, there will be individuals within the population whose MHC molecules can effectively bind and present critical pathogen-derived peptides, thereby initiating a protective immune response. This diversity prevents a single pathogen from evolving to escape immune recognition by the entire host population, a phenomenon that could lead to a devastating epidemic.\n\nConversely, a **low** $H_e$ would imply limited MHC diversity and a high frequency of homozygotes. Such a population would have a restricted repertoire of peptide presentation capabilities and would be highly vulnerable to pathogens that have evolved to evade presentation by the few common MHC alleles. Therefore, a high $H_e$ at an MHC locus indicates a robust and broad capacity for pathogen peptide recognition at the population level, enhancing collective fitness and survival in the face of diverse and evolving pathogens. This is a classic example of balancing selection operating on the immune system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8580}$$", "id": "2813638"}, {"introduction": "The presentation of exogenous antigens on MHC class II molecules is a tightly orchestrated process involving subcellular trafficking, controlled proteolysis, and peptide editing.

It provides the initial state (WT pathway), the specific perturbation (mutation), the direct consequence of the perturbation (mis-trafficking), and the necessary assumptions (other machinery is intact). There are no contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe solution is derived from the following first principles of MHC class II antigen presentation:\n\n1.  **Function of the Invariant Chain (Ii)**: In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Ii associates with newly synthesized MHC II $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ chains. This association serves three critical functions: (i) it prevents peptides present in the ER from binding to the MHC II groove, as the CLIP portion of Ii occupies the groove; (ii) it acts as a chaperone for MHC II folding and exit from the ER; and (iii) its cytosolic tail contains sorting signals that target the MHC II–Ii complex to the endocytic pathway.\n\n2.  **The MHC Class II Compartment (MIIC)**: In the wild type (WT) pathway, the Ii sorting signals route the MHC II–Ii complex from the TGN to specialized late endosomal/lysosomal compartments known as MIICs. These compartments are characterized by an acidic $pH$ ($4.5$–$5.5$) and contain the necessary enzymatic machinery for peptide loading.\n\n3.  **Peptide Loading in the MIIC**: Within the MIIC, a sequence of events occurs:\n    -   Acid-activated proteases (e.g., cathepsins) degrade the Ii, leaving only the small CLIP fragment bound in the MHC II peptide-binding groove.\n    -   Exogenous proteins, taken up via endocytosis, and certain self-proteins, delivered via autophagy, are also degraded into peptides within this endosomal system.\n    -   HLA-DM, a resident protein of the MIIC, catalyzes the release of CLIP from the MHC II groove.\n    -   HLA-DM then acts as a peptide editor, facilitating the exchange of transiently bound, low-affinity peptides for high-affinity peptides. This kinetic selection ensures that MHC II molecules are loaded with stable peptide ligands.\n\n4.  **Surface Expression**: Stable peptide–MHC II complexes are transported from the MIIC to the cell surface for presentation to CD4+ T cells.\n\nApplying these principles to the mutant cell line:\n\nThe mutation in the Ii sorting motif causes the MHC II–Ii complexes to be routed directly from the TGN to the plasma membrane. This completely bypasses the MIIC. The consequences are as follows:\n\n-   **Effect on $f_{\\mathrm{Ii/CLIP}}$**: Since the MHC II–Ii complexes do not traffic through the acidic MIIC, they are not exposed to the acid-dependent proteases that cleave Ii, nor to HLA-DM, which catalyzes CLIP removal. Therefore, the vast majority of MHC II molecules arriving at the cell surface will still have their peptide-binding groove occupied by intact Ii or a partially processed fragment, if any cleavage occurs via other minor pathways. In WT cells, this processing is highly efficient, so $f_{\\mathrm{Ii/CLIP}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$ is near zero. In the mutant, this fraction will be very high. Thus, we predict $f_{\\mathrm{Ii/CLIP}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} \\to 1$.\n\n-   **Effect on $f_{\\mathrm{exo}}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{self}}$**: The loading of peptides from both exogenous (endocytosed) and endogenous (autophagy-delivered) sources occurs within the MIIC. By bypassing the MIIC, the MHC II molecules fail to encounter the pool of processed antigenic peptides and the HLA-DM machinery required for loading. Consequently, the formation of both exogenous peptide–MHC II and self-peptide–MHC II complexes will be severely inhibited. In WT cells, these fractions constitute the majority of surface MHC II. In the mutant, they will be negligible. We predict $f_{\\mathrm{exo}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} \\ll f_{\\mathrm{exo}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{self}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} \\ll f_{\\mathrm{self}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$.\n\n-   **Effect on $t_{1/2}$**: The kinetic stability ($t_{1/2}$) of a peptide–MHC II complex is determined by the peptide's binding affinity. The HLA-DM-mediated editing process in WT cells selects for high-affinity peptides, resulting in highly stable complexes with long half-lives ($t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$ is typically many hours to days). In the mutant, the MIIC is bypassed, so there is no HLA-DM editing. If any peptide loading were to occur through some inefficient, alternative mechanism (e.g., at the cell surface, which is extremely inefficient due to neutral $pH$ and the presence of Ii/CLIP), it would be a random, un-edited process. This would lead to the formation of complexes predominantly with low-affinity peptides, which are kinetically unstable and dissociate rapidly. Therefore, the average half-life of any residual peptide-MHC II complexes would be significantly shorter than in WT cells. We predict $t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{mut}} < t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $f_{\\mathrm{exo}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} \\ll f_{\\mathrm{exo}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$; $f_{\\mathrm{self}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} \\ll f_{\\mathrm{self}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$; $f_{\\mathrm{Ii/CLIP}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} \\to 1$; residual peptide–MHC II (if any) exhibits $t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{mut}} < t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$ due to lack of HLA-DM editing.**\nThis option correctly predicts a drastic reduction in both exogenous and self-peptide loading ($f_{\\mathrm{exo}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} \\ll f_{\\mathrm{exo}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$, $f_{\\mathrm{self}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} \\ll f_{\\mathrm{self}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$) because the MIIC, the site of loading, is bypassed. It correctly predicts that surface MHC II will be almost entirely occupied by Ii/CLIP ($f_{\\mathrm{Ii/CLIP}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} \\to 1$) because the processing machinery in the MIIC is not encountered. It also correctly predicts that any peptide-MHC II complexes that might form would be unstable ($t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{mut}} < t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$) due to the absence of HLA-DM-mediated kinetic selection. This option is fully consistent with our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $f_{\\mathrm{exo}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} \\downarrow$ but $f_{\\mathrm{self}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} \\gg f_{\\mathrm{self}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$ because MHC II loads endogenous peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) when misrouted; $f_{\\mathrm{Ii/CLIP}}^{\\mathrm{mut}}$ unchanged; $t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{mut}} \\approx t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$.**\nThis option is incorrect. It claims that self-peptide loading in the ER will be greatly enhanced. This is false; a primary function of the invariant chain, which is still present, is to block the peptide-binding groove in the ER. The claim that $f_{\\mathrm{Ii/CLIP}}^{\\mathrm{mut}}$ is unchanged is also incorrect; it should be drastically increased. The claim that $t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{mut}} \\approx t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$ is incorrect, as it ignores the critical role of HLA-DM in selecting for stable complexes.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $f_{\\mathrm{exo}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} \\gg f_{\\mathrm{exo}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$ because MHC II encounters abundant extracellular peptides at the surface; $f_{\\mathrm{self}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} \\downarrow$; $f_{\\mathrm{Ii/CLIP}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} \\downarrow$; $t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{mut}} \\uparrow$ due to stabilization by abundant ligands.**\nThis option incorrectly assumes that Ii/CLIP can be spontaneously displaced by extracellular peptides at the neutral $pH$ of the plasma membrane. This process requires the acidic environment and catalytic activity of the MIIC. Consequently, the premise that $f_{\\mathrm{exo}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} \\gg f_{\\mathrm{exo}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$ is false. It follows that the claims of decreased $f_{\\mathrm{Ii/CLIP}}^{\\mathrm{mut}}$ and increased $t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{mut}}$ are also false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. No substantive change: $f_{\\mathrm{exo}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} \\approx f_{\\mathrm{exo}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$, $f_{\\mathrm{self}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} \\approx f_{\\mathrm{self}}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$, and $t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{mut}} \\approx t_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$ because signals in MHC II cytosolic tails compensate for the loss of Ii sorting, preserving normal routing to MIIC.**\nThis option is incorrect because its central premise—that MHC II tails compensate for the Ii mutation—directly contradicts the problem statement that the complexes are misdirected. It is also biologically incorrect, as the Ii chain carries the dominant sorting signals. Rerouting the entire MHC II cohort away from the antigen processing compartment must, by definition, cause a substantive change.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2813637"}, {"introduction": "A T cell's decision to activate is critically dependent not just on the identity of a peptide-MHC (pMHC) complex, but also on its abundance and kinetic stability at the cell surface.

The rate of change of $N(t)$, denoted $\\frac{dN}{dt}$, is the difference between the rate of supply and the rate of removal. The problem states that complexes are supplied at a constant rate $s$. Removal occurs via two independent, first-order processes: peptide dissociation with rate constant $k_{\\text{off}}$ and complex internalization with rate constant $k_{\\text{int}}$. The total rate of removal is therefore the sum of the rates of these two processes, which is $(k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{int}})N(t)$.

Any shorter half-life (i.e., a larger $k_{\\text{off}}$) would result in a lower $N_{\\text{ss}}$ and a probability $p < p^{\\ast}$. Therefore, the value we calculate is indeed the minimal required half-life.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $k_{\\text{off}}$ into the half-life formula, we obtain the analytical solution for $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{-\\frac{s \\beta}{\\ln(1 - p^{\\ast})} - k_{\\text{int}}}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$s = 1.20 \\times 10^{4}$ complexes cell$^{-1}$ h$^{-1}$\n$k_{\\text{int}} = 0.20$ h$^{-1}$\n$\\beta = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ complex$^{-1}$\n$p^{\\ast} = 0.90$\n\nFirst, calculate the value of $k_{\\text{off}}$:\n$$\nk_{\\text{off}} = -\\frac{(1.20 \\times 10^{4}) \\cdot (2.0 \\times 10^{-4})}{\\ln(1 - 0.90)} - 0.20\n$$\n$$\nk_{\\text{off}} = -\\frac{2.4}{\\ln(0.10)} - 0.20\n$$\nSince $\\ln(0.10) = -\\ln(10)$, this becomes:\n$$\nk_{\\text{off}} = \\frac{2.4}{\\ln(10)} - 0.20 \\text{ h}^{-1}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$:\n$$\nk_{\\text{off}} \\approx \\frac{2.4}{2.302585} - 0.20 \\approx 1.042306 - 0.20 = 0.842306 \\text{ h}^{-1}\n$$\n\nNow we can calculate the half-life $\\tau$ in hours:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\text{off}}} \\approx \\frac{0.693147}{0.842306} \\approx 0.82291 \\text{ h}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer in minutes, rounded to three significant figures. To convert from hours to minutes, we multiply by $60$:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{min}} = 0.82291 \\text{ h} \\times 60 \\frac{\\text{min}}{\\text{h}} \\approx 49.3746 \\text{ min}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $49.4$ minutes.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{49.4}\n$$", "id": "2813652"}]}
