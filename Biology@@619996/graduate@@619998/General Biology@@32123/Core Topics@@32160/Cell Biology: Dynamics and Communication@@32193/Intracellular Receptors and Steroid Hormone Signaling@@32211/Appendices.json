All necessary parameters are provided, and their values are within a physiologically plausible range. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nLet us denote the concentrations of free cortisol, corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), and serum albumin (Alb) as $[L]$, $[P_1]$, and $[P_2]$, respectively. The total concentrations are given as $[L]_{\\text{total}}$, $[P_1]_{\\text{total}}$, and $[P_2]_{\\text{total}}$. The cortisol-CBG complex is $[LP_1]$ and the cortisol-albumin complex is $[LP_2]$. The corresponding equilibrium dissociation constants are $K_{d,1}$ and $K_{d,2}$.\n\nThe problem is governed by the following set of equations based on mass conservation and the law of mass action:\n1. Conservation of total cortisol:\n$$[L]_{\\text{total}} = [L] + [LP_1] + [LP_2]$$\n2. Conservation of total CBG:\n$$[P_1]_{\\text{total}} = [P_1] + [LP_1]$$\n3.

Substituting this into equation (4):\n$$K_{d,1} = \\frac{[L]([P_1]_{\\text{total}} - [LP_1])}{[LP_1]}$$\nRearranging to solve for the concentration of the cortisol-CBG complex, $[LP_1]$:\n$$K_{d,1} [LP_1] = [L][P_1]_{\\text{total}} - [L][LP_1]$$\n$$[LP_1](K_{d,1} + [L]) = [L][P_1]_{\\text{total}}$$\n$$[LP_1] = \\frac{[L][P_1]_{\\text{total}}}{K_{d,1} + [L]}$$\nBy an identical derivation for albumin, we find the concentration of the cortisol-albumin complex, $[LP_2]$:\n$$[LP_2] = \\frac{[L][P_2]_{\\text{total}}}{K_{d,2} + [L]}$$\nNow, we substitute these expressions for $[LP_1]$ and $[LP_2]$ into the cortisol conservation equation (1).
