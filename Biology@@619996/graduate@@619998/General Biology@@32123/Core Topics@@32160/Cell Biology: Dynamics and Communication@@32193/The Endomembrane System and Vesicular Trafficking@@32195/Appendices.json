There are no logical contradictions, factual inaccuracies, or ambiguities. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem describes a two-compartment model for the trafficking of an enzyme between the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. Let $N_{E}(t)$ be the number of enzyme molecules in the ER and $N_{G}(t)$ be the number of enzyme molecules in the Golgi at time $t$. The total number of enzyme molecules, $N_{T}$, is constant. This is expressed by the conservation law:\n$$N_{E}(t) + N_{G}(t) = N_{T}$$\n\nThe transport processes are described by first-order kinetics. The rate of forward transport from the ER to the Golgi is proportional to the number of molecules in the ER, with a rate constant $k_{esc}$. The rate of retrieval from the Golgi to the ER is proportional to the number of molecules in the Golgi, with a rate constant $k_{ret}$.\n\nBased on these principles of mass-action kinetics, we can write a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that govern the dynamics of the system. The rate of change of molecules in each compartment is the rate of inflow minus the rate of outflow.\n\nFor the Golgi compartment, the rate of change is:\n$$\\frac{dN_{G}}{dt} = (\\text{Flux from ER to Golgi}) - (\\text{Flux from Golgi to ER})$$\n$$\\frac{dN_{G}}{dt} = k_{esc} N_{E}(t) - k_{ret} N_{G}(t)$$\n\nSimilarly, for the ER compartment:\n$$\\frac{dN_{E}}{dt} = (\\text{Flux from Golgi to ER}) - (\\text{Flux from ER to Golgi})$$\n$$\\frac{dN_{E}}{dt} = k_{ret} N_{G}(t) - k_{esc} N_{E}(t)$$\nNote that $\\frac{dN_{E}}{dt} + \\frac{dN_{G}}{dt} = 0$, which is consistent with the conservation of the total number of molecules $N_{T}$.\n\nThe problem requires finding the steady-state fraction of the enzyme in the Golgi. The definition of steady state is that the populations in the compartments no longer change with time. Mathematically, this means the time derivatives are zero.
