The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and relationships ($k_{B}N_{A}=R$) for a unique solution. It is objective and free of ambiguity. No violations of scientific principles, logical inconsistencies, or factual errors are present. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nStep 3: Proceed with Solution.\n\nThe problem requires a calculation starting from first principles. The first principle stated is that the free energies of independent processes are additive. Here, we are told that $N=3$ SNARE complexes act cooperatively. The total free energy released per fusion event, at the molecular level, is the sum of the energy released by each complex.\n\nLet $\\Delta G_{\\text{molecule, release}}$ be the energy released by $N$ complexes.\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{molecule, release}} = N \\times (\\text{energy released per complex})\n$$\nSubstituting the given values, $N=3$ and the energy per complex is $20\\,k_{B}T$:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{molecule, release}} = 3 \\times (20\\,k_{B}T) = 60\\,k_{B}T\n$$\nThis quantity represents the energy released per single fusion event, which involves a set of $3$ SNAREs.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires converting this per-molecule energy into a molar quantity, denoted as $\\Delta G_{\\text{release, mol}}$. A mole consists of $N_{A}$ (Avogadro's number) of elementary entities. Therefore, to find the energy released per mole of fusion events, we must multiply the energy per event by $N_{A}$.\n\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{release, mol}} = \\Delta G_{\\text{molecule, release}} \\times N_{A}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta G_{\\text{molecule, release}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{release, mol}} = (60\\,k_{B}T) \\times N_{A}\n$$\nBy rearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{release, mol}} = 60 \\times (k_{B} N_{A}) \\times T\n$$\nThe problem provides the crucial identity $k_{B}N_{A} = R$, where $R$ is the molar gas constant. Substituting this identity gives the final symbolic expression for the molar free energy released:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{release, mol}} = 60 RT\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the total molar free energy released when $N=3$ SNARE complexes form.\n\nNow, we must evaluate this expression numerically using the provided constants: $R=8.3145\\,\\text{J mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$ and $T=310\\,\\text{K}$.\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{release, mol}} = 60 \\times (8.3145\\,\\text{J mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}) \\times (310\\,\\text{K})\n$$\nThe calculation yields:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{release, mol}} = 154629.3\\,\\text{J mol}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be in units of kilojoules per mole ($\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$). To convert from $\\text{J mol}^{-1}$ to $\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$, we divide by $1000$:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{release, mol}} = \\frac{154629.3}{1000}\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1} = 154.6293\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}\n$$\nThe final answer must be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{release, mol}} \\approx 154.6\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}\n$$\n\nFor completeness, as instructed, we briefly compare this released energy with the fusion barrier. The barrier is given in the range of $40\\,k_{B}T$ to $60\\,k_{B}T$. We convert this range to molar units using the same methodology:\n$$\nE_{\\text{barrier, mol}} = (40 \\text{ to } 60) \\times RT\n$$\nLower limit: $40 \\times (8.3145\\,\\text{J mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}) \\times (310\\,\\text{K}) \\approx 103100\\,\\text{J mol}^{-1} = 103.1\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$.\nUpper limit: $60 \\times (8.3145\\,\\text{J mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}) \\times (310\\,\\text{K}) \\approx 154600\\,\\text{J mol}^{-1} = 154.6\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$.\nThe fusion barrier is therefore in the range of approximately $103.1$ to $154.6\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$.

It is free from scientific falsehoods, contradictions, or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe total electrical capacitance of the plasma membrane, $C_{total}$, is directly proportional to its total surface area, $A_{total}$. This relationship is defined by the specific membrane capacitance, $C_{m}$, which is an intrinsic property of the lipid bilayer and is given as constant. The governing equation is:\n$$C_{total} = C_{m} \\cdot A_{total}$$\nAny change in the total surface area of the plasma membrane, $\\Delta A_{total}$, will result in a corresponding change in the total capacitance, $\\Delta C_{total}$, given by $\\Delta C_{total} = C_{m} \\cdot \\Delta A_{total}$.\n\nFirst, we address the mechanistic justification.\nExocytosis is the process by which a vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane, releasing its contents to the exterior and incorporating its own membrane into the plasma membrane. As the problem states, we assume the vesicle completely flattens and its membrane area is conserved. This fusion event adds the surface area of the vesicle, $A_{vesicle}$, to the cell's plasma membrane. The change in the total membrane area is therefore positive: $\\Delta A_{total} = +A_{vesicle}$. Consequently, the change in capacitance is also positive:\n$$\\Delta C_{total} = C_{m} \\cdot (+A_{vesicle})$$\nSince a single vesicle fusion is a discrete, quantum event, it produces a discrete, stepwise increase—an upward step—in the measured capacitance trace.\n\nConversely, endocytosis is the process where a patch of plasma membrane invaginates and pinches off to form an intracellular vesicle. This process removes membrane area from the plasma membrane. The change in the total membrane area is negative, equal in magnitude to the surface area of the newly formed vesicle: $\\Delta A_{total} = -A_{vesicle}$. The corresponding change in capacitance is negative:\n$$\\Delta C_{total} = C_{m} \\cdot (-A_{vesicle})$$\nThis discrete removal of membrane results in a stepwise decrease—a downward step—in the capacitance trace.\n\nNext, we compute the expected amplitude of the capacitance step for the fusion of a single spherical vesicle. The amplitude of this step, $\\Delta C$, is given by:\n$$\\Delta C = C_{m} \\cdot A_{vesicle}$$\nThe givens are the vesicle diameter, $d = 50\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, and the specific membrane capacitance, $C_{m} = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{F/cm}^{2}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the surface area of the spherical vesicle, $A_{vesicle}$.\nThe radius of the vesicle is $r = \\frac{d}{2} = \\frac{50\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{2} = 25\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\nUsing the formula for the surface area of a sphere, $A = 4\\pi r^2$:\n$$A_{vesicle} = 4\\pi (25\\,\\mathrm{nm})^{2} = 4\\pi (625\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{2}) = 2500\\pi\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{2}$$\n\nTo perform the calculation, we must work in a consistent set of units, preferably SI base units.\nWe convert $C_{m}$ from $\\mu\\mathrm{F/cm}^{2}$ to $\\mathrm{F/m}^{2}$:\n$$1\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m} \\implies 1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2} = (10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m})^{2} = 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$$\n$$1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{F} = 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F}$$\n$$C_{m} = 1\\,\\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{cm}^{2}} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F}}{10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}} = 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}^{2}$$\nWe convert $A_{vesicle}$ from $\\mathrm{nm}^{2}$ to $\\mathrm{m}^{2}$:\n$$1\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m} \\implies 1\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{2} = (10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m})^{2} = 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$$\n$$A_{vesicle} = 2500\\pi\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{2} = 2500\\pi \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2} = 2.5\\pi \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in capacitance, $\\Delta C$:\n$$\\Delta C = C_{m} \\cdot A_{vesicle} = (10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}^{2}) \\cdot (2.5\\pi \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2})$$\n$$\\Delta C = 2.5\\pi \\times 10^{-17}\\,\\mathrm{F}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer in femtofarads ($\\mathrm{fF}$).
