The solution will be derived from first principles based on the provided model assumptions and parameters.\n\nFirst, we establish the concentration of the Cdk1–cyclin B complex over time. The problem states that Cdk1 is not limiting, so the complex concentration is determined by the cyclin B concentration, denoted as $C(t)$. Cyclin B accumulates at a constant rate $k_s$ from an initial concentration of zero. This is described by the ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = k_s $$\nwith the initial condition $C(0) = 0$.

The complex exists in two states: an active, dephosphorylated state and an inactive, Wee1-phosphorylated state. The fraction of active complexes is $f_a(t)$, and the fraction of inactive complexes is $I(t)$, with the conservation relation $f_a(t) + I(t) = 1$.

This allows us to use a quasi-steady-state approximation for the fractions $f_a$ and $I$. At steady state, the rate of inactivation equals the rate of activation:\n$$ k'_w f_a = k_c I $$\nSubstituting $I = 1 - f_a$ into the balance equation:\n$$ k'_w f_a = k_c (1 - f_a) $$\n$$ k'_w f_a = k_c - k_c f_a $$\n$$ (k'_w + k_c) f_a = k_c $$\nSolving for the active fraction $f_a$, we obtain:\n$$ f_a = \\frac{k_c}{k_c + k'_w} $$\nThis expression for $f_a$ is constant in time for a given set of kinase and phosphatase activities.\n\nThe total activity of the Cdk1–cyclin B complex, $A(t)$, is the product of three terms: the intrinsic specific activity of the hypomorphic Cdk1, the concentration of active complexes, and the reduction factor for the mutation.

Therefore, we proceed to the solution.\n\nThe primary task is to determine the firing times for early and late replication domains, denoted $T_E$ and $T_L$ respectively, under different Cdk2 activity scaling factors, $s$. A domain fires when its cumulative exposure to Cdk2 activity, $X(t)$, reaches a domain-specific threshold $\\theta$.
