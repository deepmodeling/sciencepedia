It is scientifically grounded in the principles of cell population kinetics, is internally consistent, and is well-posed. We shall proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe fundamental premise is that the cell population grows exponentially in a steady state, characterized by a stable age distribution. The probability density function $p(a)$ for a cell to have an age $a$ within the cell cycle of duration $T_c$ is given as proportional to $\\exp(-\\lambda a)$, where $\\lambda$ is the population growth rate.\nLet $N_{total}$ be the total number of cells in the population. The number of cells with age between $a$ and $a+da$ is $dN = K \\exp(-\\lambda a) da$ for some normalization constant $K$.\nThe total number of cells is the integral over the entire cell cycle duration, $T_c$:\n$$N_{total} = \\int_{0}^{T_c} K \\exp(-\\lambda a) da = K \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\exp(-\\lambda a) \\right]_{0}^{T_c} = \\frac{K}{\\lambda} (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda T_c))$$\nFrom the provided assumptions, the cell cycle time $T_c$ equals the population doubling time $T_d$, and the growth rate is $\\lambda = \\frac{\\ln 2}{T_d}$. Thus, the exponent $\\lambda T_c = \\frac{\\ln 2}{T_d} T_d = \\ln 2$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $N_{total}$:\n$$N_{total} = \\frac{K}{\\lambda} (1 - \\exp(-\\ln 2)) = \\frac{K}{\\lambda} (1 - \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{K}{2\\lambda}$$\nThe number of cells $N_i$ in a specific phase $i$ that starts at age $a_{start}$ and ends at age $a_{end}$ is given by:\n$$N_i = \\int_{a_{start}}^{a_{end}} K \\exp(-\\lambda a) da = \\frac{K}{\\lambda} (\\exp(-\\lambda a_{start}) - \\exp(-\\lambda a_{end}))$$\nThe fraction of cells in phase $i$, denoted $f_i$, is the ratio $N_i / N_{total}$:\n$$f_i = \\frac{\\frac{K}{\\lambda} (\\exp(-\\lambda a_{start}) - \\exp(-\\lambda a_{end}))}{\\frac{K}{2\\lambda}} = 2 (\\exp(-\\lambda a_{start}) - \\exp(-\\lambda a_{end}))$$\nThis is the general relation between the fraction of cells in a phase and the start and end ages of that phase.\n\nWe can simplify this for any phase or sequence of phases that terminates at cell division (age $a_{end} = T_c$). Let such a phase have a duration $\\Delta T$, so its start age is $a_{start} = T_c - \\Delta T$. The fraction of cells in this terminal phase, $f$, is:\n$$f = 2 (\\exp(-\\lambda(T_c - \\Delta T)) - \\exp(-\\lambda T_c))$$\n$$f = 2 (\\exp(-\\lambda T_c)\\exp(\\lambda \\Delta T) - \\exp(-\\lambda T_c))$$\nSubstituting $\\exp(-\\lambda T_c) = 1/2$:\n$$f = 2 (\\frac{1}{2}\\exp(\\lambda \\Delta T) - \\frac{1}{2}) = \\exp(\\lambda \\Delta T) - 1$$\nThis yields a direct relationship for the duration $\\Delta T$:\n$$\\exp(\\lambda \\Delta T) = 1 + f \\implies \\Delta T = \\frac{\\ln(1+f)}{\\lambda}$$\nSince $\\lambda = \\frac{\\ln 2}{T_d}$, we have:\n$$\\Delta T = T_d \\frac{\\ln(1+f)}{\\ln 2}$$\nWe apply this formula to the phases at the end of the cell cycle, using the provided data: $T_d = 18$ h, $f_S = 0.35$, $f_M = 0.05$, and $f_{4\\mathrm{N}} = 0.25$.

According to the problem statement, there are two mutually exclusive outcomes for a given end, each with a specified probability.\n\n1.  **Leading-strand synthesis:** The DNA polymerase synthesizes the new strand continuously in the $5' \\to 3'$ direction, proceeding all the way to the end of the template strand. In this idealized case, there is no loss of sequence. The shortening is $0$. The probability of this event is given as $1/2$.\n\n2.  **Lagging-strand synthesis:** The synthesis is discontinuous, using Okazaki fragments initiated by RNA primers. At the very end of the chromosome, the final RNA primer, of length $p$, is removed. The resulting single-stranded gap at the $5'$ end of the new strand cannot be filled by DNA polymerase because there is no pre-existing $3'$-hydroxyl group upstream. This results in the loss of $p$ nucleotides from the daughter chromosome after replication. The shortening is $p$. The probability of this event is given as $1/2$.\n\nThe expected shortening per division, $\\Delta L$, is the weighted average of the outcomes, where the weights are the probabilities of each event.\nLet $S$ be the random variable representing the shortening at a single end. Its expected value, $E[S]$, is $\\Delta L$.\n$$\n\\Delta L = E[S] = (\\text{shortening if leading}) \\times P(\\text{leading}) + (\\text{shortening if lagging}) \\times P(\\text{lagging})\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\Delta L = (0) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + (p) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta L = 0 + \\frac{p}{2} = \\frac{p}{2}\n$$\nThe expected shortening at a single chromosomal end per cell division is $\\frac{p}{2}$ nucleotides. The parameter $s$, the mean length of Okazaki fragments, is irrelevant for this calculation, as the shortening is determined only by the length of the final, unreplaced primer.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Replicative Lifespan ($N^{\\star}$)**\nThe initial telomere length is $L_0$. The telomere shortens by an expected length of $\\Delta L = \\frac{p}{2}$ with each cell division. The problem assumes this expected loss occurs at each division. The telomere length after $N$ divisions, $L(N)$, can therefore be modeled as:\n$$\nL(N) = L_0 - N \\cdot \\Delta L = L_0 - N \\frac{p}{2}\n$$\nThe replicative lifespan, $N^{\\star}$, is defined as the maximum number of full cell divisions that can occur before the telomere length falls strictly below the critical length $L_c$. This is equivalent to finding the largest integer $N$ for which the telomere length is greater than or equal to $L_c$. We therefore seek the maximum integer $N^{\\star}$ that satisfies the inequality:\n$$\nL(N^{\\star}) \\ge L_c\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $L(N^{\\star})$:\n$$\nL_0 - N^{\\star} \\frac{p}{2} \\ge L_c\n$$\nWe now solve this inequality for $N^{\\star}$. It is reasonable to assume $L_0 \\ge L_c$.\n$$\nL_0 - L_c \\ge N^{\\star} \\frac{p}{2}\n$$\nMultiplying by $2/p$ (given that $p > 0$ as it represents a physical length):\n$$\n\\frac{2(L_0 - L_c)}{p} \\ge N^{\\star}\n$$\nSince $N^{\\star}$ must be an integer representing the number of full divisions, the maximum integer value of $N^{\\star}$ that satisfies this condition is the floor of the expression on the left-hand side. The floor function, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$, gives the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$.\n$$\nN^{\\star} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2(L_0 - L_c)}{p} \\right\\rfloor\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the replicative lifespan as a function of the given parameters $L_0$, $L_c$, and $p$.\n\nThe two results required by the problem are the expected shortening $\\Delta L$ and the replicative lifespan $N^{\\star}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{p}{2} & \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2(L_0 - L_c)}{p} \\right\\rfloor \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2843791"}, {"introduction": "Beyond fundamental processes, the cell cycle is governed by intricate regulatory circuits that act as molecular switches or checkpoints.

Under control conditions, $\\theta = \\theta_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}$, and the entry time is $t_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}(\\mu)$.\n$$t_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}(\\mu) = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{th}}}{(1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}) B_{0}}\\right)$$\nUnder Wee1 inhibition, $\\theta = \\theta_{\\mathrm{Wee1i}}$, and the entry time is $t_{\\mathrm{Wee1i}}(\\mu)$.\n$$t_{\\mathrm{Wee1i}}(\\mu) = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{th}}}{(1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{Wee1i}}) B_{0}}\\right)$$\nThe time shift, $\\Delta t(\\mu)$, is defined as the difference between these two times for a given growth rate $\\mu$.\n$$\\Delta t(\\mu) = t_{\\mathrm{Wee1i}}(\\mu) - t_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}(\\mu)$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the entry times:\n$$\\Delta t(\\mu) = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{th}}}{(1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{Wee1i}}) B_{0}}\\right) - \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{th}}}{(1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}) B_{0}}\\right)$$\nFactoring out the $\\frac{1}{\\mu}$ term and using the logarithm property $\\ln(x) - \\ln(y) = \\ln(x/y)$:\n$$\\Delta t(\\mu) = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{th}}}{(1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{Wee1i}}) B_{0}}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{th}}}{(1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}) B_{0}}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{th}}}{(1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{Wee1i}}) B_{0}}}{\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{th}}}{(1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}) B_{0}}}\\right)$$\nThe constant terms $A_{\\mathrm{th}}$ and $B_{0}$ cancel, yielding a simplified expression for the time shift that depends only on the phosphorylation fractions and the growth rate.\n$$\\Delta t(\\mu) = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}}{1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{Wee1i}}}\\right)$$\nSince $\\theta_{\\mathrm{ctrl}} = 0.60 > \\theta_{\\mathrm{Wee1i}} = 0.15$, the term $(1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{ctrl}})$ is smaller than $(1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{Wee1i}})$. The argument of the logarithm is less than $1$, so $\\ln(\\dots)$ is negative, and thus $\\Delta t(\\mu)$ is negative. This correctly represents an *advancement* (earlier entry) in mitosis due to Wee1 inhibition.\nThe problem requires the magnitude of this time shift, $|\\Delta t(\\mu)|$.\n$$|\\Delta t(\\mu)| = \\left| \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}}{1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{Wee1i}}}\\right) \\right| = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\left| \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}}{1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{Wee1i}}}\\right) \\right|$$\nUsing the property $|\\ln(x)| = -\\ln(x)$ for $0<x<1$, which is equivalent to $\\ln(1/x)$:\n$$|\\Delta t(\\mu)| = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{Wee1i}}}{1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}}\\right)$$\nThis quantity represents the time advancement. It is inversely proportional to the growth rate $\\mu$.\nWe are tasked with computing the ratio $R = \\frac{|\\Delta t(\\mu_{\\mathrm{slow}})|}{|\\Delta t(\\mu_{\\mathrm{fast}})|}$.\n$$|\\Delta t(\\mu_{\\mathrm{slow}})| = \\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{slow}}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{Wee1i}}}{1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}}\\right)$$\n$$|\\Delta t(\\mu_{\\mathrm{fast}})| = \\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{fast}}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{Wee1i}}}{1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}}\\right)$$\nThe ratio $R$ is therefore:\n$$R = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{slow}}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{Wee1i}}}{1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{fast}}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{Wee1i}}}{1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}}\\right)}$$\nThe term $\\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{Wee1i}}}{1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}}\\right)$ is a non-zero constant and cancels from the numerator and denominator.\n$$R = \\frac{1/\\mu_{\\mathrm{slow}}}{1/\\mu_{\\mathrm{fast}}} = \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{fast}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{slow}}}$$\nThis elegant result shows that the ratio of the time advancements depends only on the ratio of the growth rates. All other biological parameters of the model, such as $A_{\\mathrm{th}}$, $B_{0}$, and the $\\theta$ values, are irrelevant for this specific ratio.\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values for the growth rates:\n$$\\mu_{\\mathrm{fast}} = 0.014\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$$\n$$\\mu_{\\mathrm{slow}} = 0.007\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$$\n$$R = \\frac{0.014}{0.007} = 2$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed to three significant figures. Therefore, the result is $2.00$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2.00}\n$$", "id": "2843803"}]}
