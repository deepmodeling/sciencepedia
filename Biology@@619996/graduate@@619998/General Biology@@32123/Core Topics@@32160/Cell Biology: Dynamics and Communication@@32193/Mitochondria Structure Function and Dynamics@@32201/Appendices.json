The provided stoichiometric values for proton pumping by electron transport chain complexes and the structure of ATP synthase are consistent with current biochemical literature. The problem is well-posed, self-contained, and objective. It contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution through a logical, non-trivial calculation. There are no scientific or logical contradictions, no factual unsoundness, and no ambiguity in the definitions.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three logical steps as dictated by the problem.\n\nFirst, we determine the total proton cost per molecule of ATP synthesized and exported to the cytosol. This cost has two components: the cost of synthesis by ATP synthase and the cost of transporting the substrate, inorganic phosphate ($P_i$), into the mitochondrial matrix.\n\nThe cost of synthesis, $C_{\\text{syn}}$, is the number of protons required to drive the ATP synthase rotor for the synthesis of one ATP molecule. A full $360^\\circ$ rotation requires the translocation of $N_{H^+, \\text{rot}} = 8$ protons and produces $N_{\\text{ATP, rot}} = 3$ molecules of ATP. Therefore, the synthesis cost per ATP is:\n$$C_{\\text{syn}} = \\frac{N_{H^+, \\text{rot}}}{N_{\\text{ATP, rot}}} = \\frac{8}{3} \\frac{H^+}{\\text{ATP}}$$\n\nThe cost of transport, $C_{\\text{trans}}$, is the number of protons consumed to import one molecule of inorganic phosphate ($P_i$), which is required for each ATP synthesized. The problem states this is $c_{P_i} = 1$ proton per ATP.\n$$C_{\\text{trans}} = 1 \\frac{H^+}{\\text{ATP}}$$\n\nThe total proton cost per ATP, $C_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of these two costs.\n$$C_{\\text{total}} = C_{\\text{syn}} + C_{\\text{trans}} = \\frac{8}{3} + 1 = \\frac{8}{3} + \\frac{3}{3} = \\frac{11}{3} \\frac{H^+}{\\text{ATP}}$$\n\nSecond, we calculate the phosphate-to-oxygen (P/O) ratio for NADH and FADH$_2$. The P/O ratio represents the number of ATP molecules synthesized per molecule of reduced substrate oxidized (which corresponds to the consumption of one atom of oxygen, or $\\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{O_2}$). This ratio is calculated by dividing the total number of protons pumped per substrate by the total proton cost per ATP.\n\nFor NADH, $N_{H^+, \\text{NADH}} = 10$ protons are pumped. The P/O ratio for NADH is:\n$$(\\text{P/O})_{\\text{NADH}} = \\frac{N_{H^+, \\text{NADH}}}{C_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{10}{11/3} = \\frac{30}{11} \\frac{\\text{ATP}}{\\text{NADH}}$$\n\nFor FADH$_2$, $N_{H^+, \\text{FADH}_2} = 6$ protons are pumped. The P/O ratio for FADH$_2$ is:\n$$(\\text{P/O})_{\\text{FADH}_2} = \\frac{N_{H^+, \\text{FADH}_2}}{C_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{6}{11/3} = \\frac{18}{11} \\frac{\\text{ATP}}{\\text{FADH}_2}$$\n\nThird, we calculate the total ATP produced via oxidative phosphorylation from the complete oxidation of one molecule of acetyl-CoA in the TCA cycle. One turn of the TCA cycle generates $3$ molecules of NADH and $1$ molecule of FADH$_2$. The total ATP yield from OXPHOS, $N_{\\text{ATP, total}}$, is the sum of the ATP produced from all NADH and FADH$_2$ molecules.\n\n$$N_{\\text{ATP, total}} = (3 \\times (\\text{P/O})_{\\text{NADH}}) + (1 \\times (\\text{P/O})_{\\text{FADH}_2})$$\n$$N_{\\text{ATP, total}} = \\left(3 \\times \\frac{30}{11}\\right) + \\left(1 \\times \\frac{18}{11}\\right)$$\n$$N_{\\text{ATP, total}} = \\frac{90}{11} + \\frac{18}{11} = \\frac{108}{11}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures as requested.\n$$N_{\\text{ATP, total}} = \\frac{108}{11} \\approx 9.818181...$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures gives $9.818$.

The proton flux for ATP synthesis, $J_{\\text{ATP}}$, is proportional to the imposed rate of ATP demand, $R_{\\text{ATP}}$, with stoichiometry $s_{H:\\mathrm{ATP}}$:\n$$J_{\\text{ATP}} = s_{H:\\mathrm{ATP}} \\cdot R_{\\text{ATP}}$$\n\nBy substituting these expressions into the initial balance equation, we obtain a single algebraic equation in terms of the unknown variable $\\Delta p$:\n$$\\nu_{H:\\mathrm{O_2}} \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\max}\\,\\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta p_{\\max}}\\right) = s_{H:\\mathrm{ATP}} \\cdot R_{\\text{ATP}} + g_{\\text{leak}}\\cdot \\Delta p$$\n\nTo solve for $\\Delta p$, we rearrange the equation by separating terms containing $\\Delta p$ from the constant terms:\n$$\\nu_{H:\\mathrm{O_2}} \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\max} - \\frac{\\nu_{H:\\mathrm{O_2}} \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\max} \\cdot \\Delta p}{\\Delta p_{\\max}} = s_{H:\\mathrm{ATP}} \\cdot R_{\\text{ATP}} + g_{\\text{leak}}\\cdot \\Delta p$$\n$$\\nu_{H:\\mathrm{O_2}} \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\max} - s_{H:\\mathrm{ATP}} \\cdot R_{\\text{ATP}} = \\left( \\frac{\\nu_{H:\\mathrm{O_2}} \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\max}}{\\Delta p_{\\max}} + g_{\\text{leak}} \\right) \\cdot \\Delta p$$\n\nIsolating $\\Delta p$ yields the general solution for the steady-state proton motive force for any given ATP demand, $R_{\\text{ATP}}$:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{\\nu_{H:\\mathrm{O_2}} \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\max} - s_{H:\\mathrm{ATP}} \\cdot R_{\\text{ATP}}}{ \\frac{\\nu_{H:\\mathrm{O_2}} \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\max}}{\\Delta p_{\\max}} + g_{\\text{leak}} } $$\n\nWith this general formula, we can determine the conditions for \"State $4$\" and \"State $3$\" respiration.\n\n**State $4$ Respiration ($R_{\\text{ATP}} = 0$)**\nIn State $4$, there is no ATP synthesis demand. Setting $R_{\\text{ATP}} = 0$ in the general equation for $\\Delta p$ gives the proton motive force in State $4$:\n$$ \\Delta p^{\\text{state 4}} = \\frac{\\nu_{H:\\mathrm{O_2}} \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\max}}{ \\frac{\\nu_{H:\\mathrm{O_2}} \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\max}}{\\Delta p_{\\max}} + g_{\\text{leak}} } $$\nThe corresponding oxygen consumption rate, $v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\text{state 4}}$, is then found by substituting $\\Delta p^{\\text{state 4}}$ into its defining relation:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\text{state 4}} = v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\max}\\,\\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta p^{\\text{state 4}}}{\\Delta p_{\\max}}\\right) $$\n\n**State $3$ Respiration ($R_{\\text{ATP}} > 0$)**\nIn State $3$, there is an active demand for ATP synthesis. Before applying the general formula, we must check for the overload condition. The maximal proton pumping capacity of the electron transport chain occurs at $\\Delta p = 0$ and is given by $J_{\\text{pump}}^{\\max} = \\nu_{H:\\mathrm{O_2}} \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\max}$. The problem states that if the proton demand for ATP synthesis, $s_{H:\\mathrm{ATP}} \\cdot R_{\\text{ATP}}$, exceeds this capacity, the system saturates.\nTherefore, two scenarios exist for State $3$:\n\n$1$. **Overload Condition:** If $s_{H:\\mathrm{ATP}} \\cdot R_{\\text{ATP}} \\ge \\nu_{H:\\mathrm{O_2}} \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\max}$, the system is saturated. In this case, $\\Delta p^{\\text{state 3}} \\to 0$ and the oxygen consumption rate reaches its maximum:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\text{state 3}} = v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\max}$$\n\n$2$. **Sub-maximal Demand:** If $s_{H:\\mathrm{ATP}} \\cdot R_{\\text{ATP}} < \\nu_{H:\\mathrm{O_2}} \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\max}$, the system is not saturated. $\\Delta p^{\\text{state 3}}$ is calculated using the general formula with the non-zero $R_{\\text{ATP}}$:\n$$ \\Delta p^{\\text{state 3}} = \\frac{\\nu_{H:\\mathrm{O_2}} \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\max} - s_{H:\\mathrm{ATP}} \\cdot R_{\\text{ATP}}}{ \\frac{\\nu_{H:\\mathrm{O_2}} \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\max}}{\\Delta p_{\\max}} + g_{\\text{leak}} } $$\nSubsequently, the oxygen consumption rate is calculated as:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\text{state 3}} = v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\max}\\,\\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta p^{\\text{state 3}}}{\\Delta p_{\\max}}\\right) $$\n\n**Respiratory Control Ratio ($\\mathrm{RCR}$)**\nThe $\\mathrm{RCR}$ is a measure of the coupling between respiration and ATP synthesis. It is defined as the ratio of State $3$ to State $4$ oxygen consumption:\n$$ \\mathrm{RCR} = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\text{state 3}}}{v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\text{state 4}}} $$\nA non-zero proton leak ($g_{\\text{leak}} > 0$) ensures that $v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\text{state 4}} > 0$, making this ratio well-defined.\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case involves applying these derived steps to calculate $v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\text{state 4}}$, $v_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\text{state 3}}$, and the resulting $\\mathrm{RCR}$.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates and Respiratory Control Ratio (RCR)\n    for a set of test cases based on a phenomenological model of oxidative phosphorylation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Test suite:\n    # (v_o2_max, dp_max, nu_h_o2, s_h_atp, g_leak, R_atp_demand) with units:\n    # (nmol O2/s/mg, mV, dimensionless, dimensionless, nmol H+/s/mg/mV, nmol ATP/s/mg)\n    test_cases = [\n        (12.0, 220.0, 20.0, 4.0, 0.1, 30.0),  # Case 1\n        (12.0, 220.0, 20.0, 4.0, 0.5, 30.0),  # Case 2\n        (10.0, 200.0, 20.0, 4.0, 0.2, 0.0),   # Case 3\n        (8.0, 220.0, 20.0, 4.0, 0.05, 60.0),   # Case 4\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        v_o2_max, dp_max, nu_h_o2, s_h_atp, g_leak, R_atp_demand = case\n\n        # --- Pre-calculation of common terms ---\n        # Maximum proton pumping capacity at delta_p = 0\n        J_pump_max = nu_h_o2 * v_o2_max\n        # Denominator for the delta_p calculation, which is constant for a given set of mitochondrial parameters\n        dp_denominator = (J_pump_max / dp_max) + g_leak\n\n        # --- State 4 Calculation (R_atp = 0) ---\n        # Numerator for delta_p calculation in State 4\n        dp_numerator_4 = J_pump_max\n        dp_state4 = dp_numerator_4 / dp_denominator\n        v_o2_state4 = v_o2_max * (1 - dp_state4 / dp_max)\n\n        # --- State 3 Calculation (R_atp > 0) ---\n        # Proton consumption demand for ATP synthesis\n        J_atp_demand = s_h_atp * R_atp_demand\n\n        # Check for overload condition\n        if J_atp_demand >= J_pump_max:\n            # Saturated system: delta_p -> 0, v_o2 -> v_o2_max\n            v_o2_state3 = v_o2_max\n        else:\n            # Sub-maximal demand: calculate steady-state delta_p and v_o2\n            dp_numerator_3 = J_pump_max - J_atp_demand\n            dp_state3 = dp_numerator_3 / dp_denominator\n            v_o2_state3 = v_o2_max * (1 - dp_state3 / dp_max)\n\n        # --- RCR Calculation ---\n        # RCR is well-defined as g_leak > 0 ensures v_o2_state4 > 0\n        rcr = v_o2_state3 / v_o2_state4 if v_o2_state4 != 0 else np.inf\n\n        results.append([\n            round(v_o2_state4, 6),\n            round(v_o2_state3, 6),\n            round(rcr, 6)\n        ])\n    \n    # Format the final output string as per the problem specification\n    # e.g., [[x1,y1,z1],[x2,y2,z2],...]\n    output_str = \"[\" + \",\".join([f\"[{v4:.6f},{v3:.6f},{r:.6f}]\" for v4, v3, r in results]) + \"]\"\n    print(output_str)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2817480"}]}
