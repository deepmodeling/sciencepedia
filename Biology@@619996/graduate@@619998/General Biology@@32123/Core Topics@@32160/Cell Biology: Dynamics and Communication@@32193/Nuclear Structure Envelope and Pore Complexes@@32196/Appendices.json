It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem based on a simplified biophysical model of macromolecular transport through the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC). All necessary parameters are provided, and the problem is free of contradictions or ambiguities. We will proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two quantities: ($1$) the total cross-sectional area of the NPC channel, and ($2$) the maximum Stokes radius of a particle that can passively diffuse through it, given a certain fractional occlusion.\n\nFirst, we address the calculation of the NPC channel's cross-sectional area, which we denote as $A_{\\text{channel}}$. The problem states that the channel is a circular aperture with a diameter $d = 40 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$. The radius of a circle, $R$, is half of its diameter.\n$$R = \\frac{d}{2}$$\nSubstituting the given value for the diameter:\n$$R = \\frac{40 \\ \\mathrm{nm}}{2} = 20 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$$\nThe area of a circle is given by the formula $A = \\pi R^2$. Therefore, the total cross-sectional area of the channel is:\n$$A_{\\text{channel}} = \\pi R^2 = \\pi (20 \\ \\mathrm{nm})^2 = 400\\pi \\ \\mathrm{nm}^2$$\nTo obtain the numerical value required, we use the value of $\\pi$ and round the result to $3$ significant figures.\n$$A_{\\text{channel}} \\approx 400 \\times 3.14159... \\ \\mathrm{nm}^2 \\approx 1256.637... \\ \\mathrm{nm}^2$$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures, we get:\n$$A_{\\text{channel}} \\approx 1260 \\ \\mathrm{nm}^2$$\n\nNext, we determine the maximum Stokes radius, $r_{s,\\max}$, for a passively diffusing particle. The problem specifies that a fraction $f = 0.30$ of the channel's cross-sectional area is occluded by FG-nucleoporins. The area available for free diffusion, $A_{\\text{free}}$, is the total area minus the occluded area.\n$$A_{\\text{free}} = A_{\\text{channel}} - f \\cdot A_{\\text{channel}} = (1 - f) A_{\\text{channel}}$$\nSubstituting the given value of $f = 0.30$:\n$$A_{\\text{free}} = (1 - 0.30) A_{\\text{channel}} = 0.70 \\cdot A_{\\text{channel}}$$\nThe diffusing particle is modeled as a hard sphere with a Stokes radius $r_s$. Its effective cross-sectional area, $A_{\\text{particle}}$, is therefore:\n$$A_{\\text{particle}} = \\pi r_s^2$$\nThe condition for passive diffusion is that the particle's cross-sectional area must be less than or equal to the available free area, i.e., $A_{\\text{particle}} \\le A_{\\text{free}}$. The maximum possible Stokes radius, $r_{s,\\max}$, corresponds to the case where the particle's area is exactly equal to the free area.\n$$\\pi r_{s,\\max}^2 = A_{\\text{free}}$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $A_{\\text{free}}$ in terms of the channel geometry.\n$$\\pi r_{s,\\max}^2 = (1 - f) A_{\\text{channel}} = (1 - f) \\pi R^2$$\nWe can simplify this expression by canceling $\\pi$ from both sides.\n$$r_{s,\\max}^2 = (1 - f) R^2$$\nTaking the square root of both sides yields the expression for the maximum Stokes radius:\n$$r_{s,\\max} = \\sqrt{(1 - f) R^2} = R \\sqrt{1 - f}$$\nUsing the known values $R = 20 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$ and $f = 0.30$:\n$$r_{s,\\max} = (20 \\ \\mathrm{nm}) \\cdot \\sqrt{1 - 0.30} = (20 \\ \\mathrm{nm}) \\cdot \\sqrt{0.70}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$r_{s,\\max} \\approx (20 \\ \\mathrm{nm}) \\cdot 0.83666... \\approx 16.7332... \\ \\mathrm{nm}$$\nRounding this result to $3$ significant figures, we obtain:\n$$r_{s,\\max} \\approx 16.7 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$$\n\nThe required results are the area in $\\mathrm{nm}^2$ and the radius in $\\mathrm{nm}$, both rounded to $3$ significant figures.

It is scientifically grounded, employing a standard and widely accepted compartmental model for nucleocytoplasmic transport. The use of first-order kinetics is a valid simplification for such systems. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and a clear objective, which guarantees a unique solution. The language is objective and the model, despite its simplifications, is mathematically and physically self-consistent. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a formal solution may proceed.\n\nThe transport dynamics are described by mass-action kinetics. The rate of change of the nuclear concentration, $N(t)$, is the difference between the flux of cargo into the nucleus and the flux out of the nucleus. Given that the fluxes are first-order with respect to the concentration in the source compartment, the governing ordinary differential equation for the nuclear concentration is:\n$$ \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = k_{\\text{in}} C(t) - k_{\\text{out}} N(t) $$\nHere, the term $k_{\\text{in}} C(t)$ represents the import flux from the cytoplasm, and $k_{\\text{out}} N(t)$ represents the export flux from the nucleus.\n\nThe problem requires an analysis at steady state. At steady state, the system has reached equilibrium, and the net flux across the nuclear envelope is zero. Consequently, all concentrations are constant with respect to time. This condition is expressed mathematically as:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = 0 $$\nApplying this condition to the kinetic equation yields the algebraic relationship for steady-state concentrations, denoted with subscript $ss$:\n$$ k_{\\text{in}} C_{ss} - k_{\\text{out}} N_{ss} = 0 $$\nThis equation can be rearranged to relate the nuclear and cytoplasmic concentrations at steady state:\n$$ k_{\\text{out}} N_{ss} = k_{\\text{in}} C_{ss} $$\nThe problem defines the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic concentration ratio as $R \\equiv N/C$. At steady state, this ratio, $R_{ss}$, is derived from the preceding equation:\n$$ R_{ss} = \\frac{N_{ss}}{C_{ss}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{in}}}{k_{\\text{out}}} $$\nThis fundamental result shows that the steady-state accumulation of cargo is determined entirely by the ratio of the import and export rate constants.\n\nWe will now calculate this ratio for the two specified conditions: baseline and drug treatment.\n\nFirst, under baseline conditions, the given rate constants are:\n$k_{\\text{in, base}} = 0.2\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\text{out, base}} = 0.05\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\nThe steady-state ratio for the baseline case, $R_{\\text{base}}$, is:\n$$ R_{\\text{base}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{in, base}}}{k_{\\text{out, base}}} = \\frac{0.2}{0.05} = 4 $$\n\nSecond, under treatment with importazole, the import rate constant is reduced by $50\\%$. The new import rate constant, $k_{\\text{in, drug}}$, becomes:\n$$ k_{\\text{in, drug}} = (1 - 0.5) \\times k_{\\text{in, base}} = 0.5 \\times k_{\\text{in, base}} $$\nThe export rate constant, $k_{\\text{out}}$, is stated to be unchanged:\n$$ k_{\\text{out, drug}} = k_{\\text{out, base}} $$\nThe steady-state ratio under drug treatment, $R_{\\text{drug}}$, is therefore:\n$$ R_{\\text{drug}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{in, drug}}}{k_{\\text{out, drug}}} = \\frac{0.5 \\times k_{\\text{in, base}}}{k_{\\text{out, base}}} $$\n\nThe objective is to find the fold-change in the steady-state ratio, which is the quotient $\\frac{R_{\\text{drug}}}{R_{\\text{base}}}$. We construct this quotient using the derived expressions:\n$$ \\frac{R_{\\text{drug}}}{R_{\\text{base}}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{0.5 \\times k_{\\text{in, base}}}{k_{\\text{out, base}}} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{in, base}}}{k_{\\text{out, base}}} \\right)} $$\nThe terms corresponding to the baseline rate constants, $\\frac{k_{\\text{in, base}}}{k_{\\text{out, base}}}$, cancel from the numerator and the denominator. This leaves a simple numerical factor:\n$$ \\frac{R_{\\text{drug}}}{R_{\\text{base}}} = 0.5 $$\nThis result is independent of the specific numerical values of the rate constants and follows directly from the stated $50\\%$ reduction in $k_{\\text{in}}$. The fold-change is exactly corresponding to the fractional change in the import rate constant, as the export rate constant is held fixed.\nTo verify with the provided numbers:\n$R_{\\text{base}} = 4$.\n$k_{\\text{in, drug}} = 0.5 \\times 0.2\\,\\text{s}^{-1} = 0.1\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n$k_{\\text{out, drug}} = 0.05\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n$R_{\\text{drug}} = \\frac{0.1}{0.05} = 2$.\nThe fold-change is $\\frac{R_{\\text{drug}}}{R_{\\text{base}}} = \\frac{2}{4} = 0.5$.\nThe result is a dimensionless number, as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5}$$", "id": "2819519"}, {"introduction": "Beyond its role in regulating molecular traffic, the nuclear envelope, supported by the underlying nuclear lamina, is a critical contributor to the mechanical integrity of the cell.
