It represents a standard analysis of a two-phase composite material.\n\nThis problem requires the calculation of the effective Young's modulus for a two-phase composite material, represented by a ligament-mimetic hydrogel. The two phases are collagen fibers (the reinforcement) and a glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-rich gel (the matrix). We are given the volume fractions $v_{c} = 0.02$ and $v_{g} = 0.98$, and the Young's moduli of the components, $E_{c} = 500 \\times 10^{6}$ Pa and $E_{g} = 5 \\times 10^{3}$ Pa. We will use two idealizations: the Voigt model (iso-strain) and the Reuss model (iso-stress).\n\nFirst, we compute the Voigt bound, $E_{V}$, which corresponds to the iso-strain condition. This model assumes that when loaded parallel to the fibers, both phases experience the same strain, $\\epsilon_{c} = \\epsilon_{g} = \\epsilon$. The total stress on the composite, $\\sigma$, is the volume-weighted average of the stresses in the individual phases:\n$$\n\\sigma = v_{c}\\sigma_{c} + v_{g}\\sigma_{g}\n$$\nThe effective modulus is defined as $E = \\sigma/\\epsilon$. Substituting the stress-strain relationship for each phase ($\\sigma_{i} = E_{i}\\epsilon_{i}$) gives:\n$$\nE_{V}\\epsilon = v_{c}(E_{c}\\epsilon_{c}) + v_{g}(E_{g}\\epsilon_{g})\n$$\nGiven the iso-strain assumption, we can cancel the strain term $\\epsilon$:\n$$\nE_{V} = v_{c}E_{c} + v_{g}E_{g}\n$$\nThis is the rule of mixtures and provides the theoretical upper bound for the composite's Young's modulus. Substituting the given values:\n$$\nE_{V} = (0.02)(500 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ Pa}) + (0.98)(5 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ Pa})\n$$\n$$\nE_{V} = 10 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ Pa} + 4900 \\text{ Pa} = 10,004,900 \\text{ Pa}\n$$\n\nSecond, we compute the Reuss bound, $E_{R}$, which corresponds to the iso-stress condition. This model assumes that the stress is uniform across both phases, $\\sigma_{c} = \\sigma_{g} = \\sigma$. This condition is typically associated with loading perpendicular to the fiber orientation. The total strain, $\\epsilon$, is the volume-weighted average of the strains in the components:\n$$\n\\epsilon = v_{c}\\epsilon_{c} + v_{g}\\epsilon_{g}\n$$\nSubstituting the strain-stress relationship ($\\epsilon_{i} = \\sigma_{i}/E_{i}$) gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma}{E_{R}} = v_{c}\\frac{\\sigma_{c}}{E_{c}} + v_{g}\\frac{\\sigma_{g}}{E_{g}}\n$$\nGiven the iso-stress assumption, we can cancel the stress term $\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{E_{R}} = \\frac{v_{c}}{E_{c}} + \\frac{v_{g}}{E_{g}}\n$$\nThis is the inverse rule of mixtures and provides the theoretical lower bound. Substituting the given values:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{E_{R}} = \\frac{0.02}{500 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ Pa}} + \\frac{0.98}{5 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ Pa}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{E_{R}} = (4 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ Pa}^{-1}) + (1.96 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ Pa}^{-1}) = 1.9600004 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ Pa}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nE_{R} = \\frac{1}{1.9600004 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ Pa}^{-1}} \\approx 5102.04 \\text{ Pa}\n$$\n\nNext, we justify which bound is a better approximation for the two specified loading cases.\n(i) For uniaxial tension along the fiber axis, the stiff collagen fibers are oriented parallel to the load. Assuming a perfect bond between fibers and matrix, both phases must deform together, experiencing the same strain. This is the definition of the iso-strain condition. The stiff fibers carry a much larger portion of the stress than the soft matrix, dominating the overall response. Therefore, the Voigt bound ($E_{V}$) is expected to be a much better approximation of the tissue's effective modulus.\n\n(ii) For confined compression where fibers do not carry compressive load, the situation changes. Slender fibers such as collagen are known to buckle under compression and thus provide negligible resistance. The entire compressive load is borne by the GAG-rich gel matrix. While the iso-stress condition ($\\sigma_c = \\sigma_g$) is not strictly met (as $\\sigma_c \\approx 0$), the physical outcome is that the overall stiffness is dictated by the most compliant phase (the gel). The Reuss model, which yields an effective modulus close to that of the softest component, represents this behavior. The Reuss bound ($E_{R} \\approx 5.1 \\text{ kPa}$) is very close to the gel's modulus ($E_{g} = 5 \\text{ kPa}$), whereas the Voigt bound ($E_{V} > 10 \\text{ MPa}$) is orders of magnitude too high. Thus, the Reuss bound provides a better approximation for this compressive loading scenario.\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute the Voigt–Reuss–Hill (VRH) average, which is the arithmetic mean of the Voigt and Reuss bounds:\n$$\nE_{VRH} = \\frac{E_{V} + E_{R}}{2}\n$$\nUsing the calculated values:\n$$\nE_{VRH} = \\frac{10,004,900 \\text{ Pa} + 5102.04 \\text{ Pa}}{2} = \\frac{10,010,002.04 \\text{ Pa}}{2} = 5,005,001.02 \\text{ Pa}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in kilopascals (kPa), rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n1 \\text{ kPa} = 1000 \\text{ Pa}\n$$\n$$\nE_{VRH} = 5005.00102 \\text{ kPa}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $5005$ kPa.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5005}$$", "id": "2799166"}, {"introduction": "The overall strength of a cell's attachment to the extracellular matrix is determined by the collective action of thousands of individual molecular bonds at the interface.
