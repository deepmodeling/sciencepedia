No contradictions or missing critical information are found.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Current-Voltage Relationship**\n\nThe net flow of ions through a channel pore is driven by the electrochemical potential difference across the membrane. This net driving force is the difference between the electrical potential (membrane voltage, $V$) and the equilibrium potential for the ion species, also known as the reversal potential, $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$.\n\nThe reversal potential, $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$, is the voltage at which the net current through the channel is zero. By definition, at $V = E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$, the electrical and chemical potential gradients are exactly balanced, resulting in zero net flux.\n\nThe magnitude of the single-channel current, $i$, is proportional to the magnitude of the net electrochemical driving force. The constant of proportionality is the single-channel conductance, $\\gamma$. This constitutes a generalized form of Ohm's Law for an ion channel.\n\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$i(V) = \\gamma (V - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$$\nThis equation describes the current-voltage ($I-V$) relationship for a single channel. It is a linear function of $V$, where $\\gamma$ is the slope and $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ is the voltage-axis intercept (the voltage at which $i(V)=0$).\n\n**Part 2: Physical Assumptions**\n\nFor the relationship $i(V) = \\gamma (V - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$ to be valid over a range of voltages, the following assumptions must hold:\n\n1.  **Ohmic Behavior:** The single-channel conductance, $\\gamma$, must be constant and independent of the membrane voltage $V$ and the direction of ion flow. If $\\gamma$ depends on $V$, the channel is said to rectify, and the $I-V$ relationship will be non-linear. The derived linear equation assumes no rectification.\n2.  **Constant Reversal Potential:** The reversal potential, $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$, must be constant across the tested range of voltages. This requires that the ionic concentrations on both sides of the patch membrane remain stable throughout the experiment, which is a standard condition in patch-clamp recordings. The problem states \"symmetrical monovalent ionic conditions,\" which, according to the Nernst equation, implies $E_{\\mathrm{rev}} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\frac{[C]_{\\mathrm{out}}}{[C]_{\\mathrm{in}}} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln(1) = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Our analysis should therefore find an $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ close to this theoretical value.\n3.  **Accurate Voltage Clamp:** The command voltage $V$ must accurately represent the true transmembrane potential. This implies that the voltage drop across the series resistance of the pipette tip and electrode is negligible. Significant series resistance would cause the true membrane potential to deviate from the command potential, introducing a systematic error and potentially making the observed $I-V$ curve appear sub-linear at large currents.\n\n**Part 3: Data Analysis and Option Evaluation**\n\nFirst, we compute the single-channel current amplitude, $i(V)$, for each voltage using the operational definition $i(V) = \\mu_{\\mathrm{o}}(V) - \\mu_{\\mathrm{c}}(V)$. The uncertainty (standard deviation) of $i(V)$, denoted $\\sigma_{i}$, is found by propagating the uncertainties of the means, $\\sigma_{\\mu_o}$ and $\\sigma_{\\mu_c}$. Assuming these uncertainties from the fit are independent, their variances add: $\\sigma_{i}^2 = \\sigma_{\\mu_o}^2 + \\sigma_{\\mu_c}^2$. The values presented as '$\\pm$ standard deviations' are interpreted as the standard errors on the fitted means.\n\n-   $V = -60\\,\\mathrm{mV}$:\n    $i = (-3.05) - (-0.02) = -3.03\\,\\mathrm{pA}$\n    $\\sigma_{i}^2 = (0.12)^2 + (0.10)^2 = 0.0144 + 0.01 = 0.0244 \\implies \\sigma_i \\approx 0.156\\,\\mathrm{pA}$\n\n-   $V = -40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$:\n    $i = (-2.01) - (0.01) = -2.02\\,\\mathrm{pA}$\n    $\\sigma_{i}^2 = (0.12)^2 + (0.09)^2 = 0.0144 + 0.0081 = 0.0225 \\implies \\sigma_i = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{pA}$\n\n-   $V = -20\\,\\mathrm{mV}$:\n    $i = (-1.01) - (0.00) = -1.01\\,\\mathrm{pA}$\n    $\\sigma_{i}^2 = (0.11)^2 + (0.10)^2 = 0.0121 + 0.01 = 0.0221 \\implies \\sigma_i \\approx 0.149\\,\\mathrm{pA}$\n\n-   $V = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$:\n    $i = (0.00) - (0.00) = 0.00\\,\\mathrm{pA}$\n    $\\sigma_{i}^2 = (0.10)^2 + (0.10)^2 = 0.01 + 0.01 = 0.0200 \\implies \\sigma_i \\approx 0.141\\,\\mathrm{pA}$\n\n-   $V = +20\\,\\mathrm{mV}$:\n    $i = (0.99) - (-0.01) = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{pA}$\n    $\\sigma_{i}^2 = (0.11)^2 + (0.10)^2 = 0.0121 + 0.01 = 0.0221 \\implies \\sigma_i \\approx 0.149\\,\\mathrm{pA}$\n\nThe data points $(V, i)$ are: $(-60, -3.03)$, $(-40, -2.02)$, $(-20, -1.01)$, $(0, 0.00)$, $(20, 1.00)$. These points are exceptionally linear. A linear regression of $i$ versus $V$ will yield the slope $\\gamma$ and the intercept, from which $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ can be calculated. Given the non-uniform uncertainties, a weighted least squares (WLS) regression is the statistically correct method, with weights $w_k = 1/\\sigma_{i,k}^2$.\n\nA simple inspection shows the slope is approximately $\\frac{\\Delta i}{\\Delta V} = \\frac{1.00 - (-3.03)}{20 - (-60)} = \\frac{4.03}{80} = 0.050375\\,\\mathrm{pA/mV}$, which is $50.375\\,\\mathrm{pS}$.

It uses the provided definition for $i(V)$, correctly identifies the regression model $i(V)$ vs. $V$, employs the statistically optimal method (WLS), and correctly interprets the slope as $\\gamma$ and the x-intercept as $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$. It also correctly notes the need to check for linearity (which the data clearly satisfies) and potential artifacts like series resistance.\n- **Reported Values:** The estimated values $\\gamma \\approx 50\\,\\mathrm{pS}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{rev}} \\approx 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ are in excellent agreement with our independent calculation from the provided data.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B.

Applied here, this gives $\\gamma \\approx 45\\,\\mathrm{pS}$.**\n- **Analysis Pipeline:** This describes an alternative method of analysis that is inconsistent with the problem statement, which mandates using the results from amplitude histograms. Dwell-time idealization is a different technique. Furthermore, constraining the fit to pass through the origin assumes $E_{\\mathrm{rev}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ apriori,preventing an independent estimate and verification. Using ordinary least squares is statistically suboptimal compared to weighted least squares.\n- **Reported Values:** The reported conductance $\\gamma \\approx 45\\,\\mathrm{pS}$ is inconsistent with the result from the provided histogram data ($ \\approx 50\\,\\mathrm{pS}$).\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. For each $V$, use the absolute open-peak location $| \\mu_{\\mathrm{o}}(V) |$ as the amplitude. Regress $| i(V) |$ on $| V |$ to avoid negative values and report the slope as $\\gamma$; estimate $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ from the $y$-intercept of this fit. Applied here, this yields $\\gamma \\approx 50\\,\\mathrm{pS}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{rev}} \\approx -0.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.**\n- **Analysis Pipeline:** This procedure is fundamentally flawed. The current amplitude is the *difference* between open and closed levels, $i(V) = \\mu_o(V) - \\mu_c(V)$, not $|\\mu_o(V)|$. Taking absolute values of current and voltage, $|i(V)|$ and $|V|$, discards essential information about the direction of current flow and artificially forces the data into the first quadrant, corrupting the linear relationship. The interpretation of fit parameters from such a distorted regression is not physically meaningful.\n- **Reported Values:** While the value for $\\gamma$ appears close by coincidence, the methodology is scientifically invalid.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. At each $V$, perform nonstationary noise analysis by binning ensemble responses to estimate the variance–mean parabola and extract $i(V)$ as the coefficient of the quadratic term.

It is completely inappropriate for a stationary recording of a single channel, as described in the problem. The method for calculating $\\gamma$ by averaging currents and voltages is ad hoc and incorrect.\n- **Reported Values:** The methodology is wrong for this experimental context, and the resulting $\\gamma$ is inconsistent with the data.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2812344"}, {"introduction": "While single-channel recordings reveal the properties of the open pore, understanding how a ligand activates the channel requires studying the collective response of a channel population to varying agonist concentrations.

Derivation of the Open Probability Expression**\n\nThe MWC model assumes a receptor can exist in two principal conformations: a closed (tense, $C$) state and an open (relaxed, $O$) state. The equilibrium between these states is influenced by the binding of ligands.\n\nThe system is defined by the following parameters:\n- $n$: The number of identical, independent binding sites for an agonist ligand.\n- $A$: The concentration of the agonist.\n- $K_C$ and $K_O$: The dissociation constants for the agonist binding to the closed and open states, respectively. The affinity ratio is defined as $c = K_O / K_C$.\n- $q$: The number of identical, independent binding sites for an allosteric modulator.\n- $M$: The concentration of the modulator.\n- $K_{MC}$ and $K_{MO}$: The dissociation constants for the modulator binding to the closed and open states, respectively. The coupling factor is defined as $\\phi = K_{MO} / K_{MC}$.\n- $L_0$: The allosteric constant, defined as the ratio of the total number of receptors in the closed state to the total number in the open state in the absence of any ligands. The problem statement gives this as $L_0 = \\frac{[\\text{Closed}]}{[\\text{Open}]}$. Let us designate the unliganded closed and open states as $R_C$ and $R_O$. Then $L_0 = [R_C]/[R_O]$.\n\nAccording to the MWC framework, the statistical weight of a macroscopic state is proportional to the product of its intrinsic conformational weight and its ligand-binding polynomials. We can assign a reference weight of $1$ to the unliganded open state, $R_O$. Consequently, the weight of the unliganded closed state, $R_C$, is $L_0$.\n\nThe binding polynomial for a ligand with concentration $x$ binding to $k$ identical and independent sites with dissociation constant $K$ is given by $\\left(1 + \\frac{x}{K}\\right)^k$.\n\nThe total statistical weight of the ensemble of all closed states, $W_C$, is the product of the intrinsic weight of the closed conformation ($L_0$) and the binding polynomials for both the agonist and the modulator.\n$$\nW_C = L_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{A}{K_C}\\right)^n \\left(1 + \\frac{M}{K_{MC}}\\right)^q\n$$\n\nSimilarly, the total statistical weight of the ensemble of all open states, $W_O$, is the product of the intrinsic weight of the open conformation ($1$) and its corresponding binding polynomials.\n$$\nW_O = 1 \\cdot \\left(1 + \\frac{A}{K_O}\\right)^n \\left(1 + \\frac{M}{K_{MO}}\\right)^q\n$$\n\nThe probability of the receptor being in an open state, $P_{open}$, is the ratio of the total weight of the open states to the sum of the total weights of both open and closed states.\n$$\nP_{open} = \\frac{W_O}{W_C + W_O} = \\frac{\\left(1 + \\frac{A}{K_O}\\right)^n \\left(1 + \\frac{M}{K_{MO}}\\right)^q}{L_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{A}{K_C}\\right)^n \\left(1 + \\frac{M}{K_{MC}}\\right)^q + \\left(1 + \\frac{A}{K_O}\\right)^n \\left(1 + \\frac{M}{K_{MO}}\\right)^q}\n$$\n\nSubstitute the defined ratios $c = K_O / K_C$ and $\\phi = K_{MO} / K_{MC}$.

The expression for $P_{open}$ becomes a function of the parameters to be estimated ($L_0, c, \\phi$) and the known constants.\n$$\nP_{open}(A, M; L_0, c, \\phi) = \\frac{\\left(1 + \\frac{A}{c K_C}\\right)^n \\left(1 + \\frac{M}{\\phi K_{MC}}\\right)^q}{L_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{A}{K_C}\\right)^n \\left(1 + \\frac{M}{K_{MC}}\\right)^q + \\left(1 + \\frac{A}{c K_C}\\right)^n \\left(1 + \\frac{M}{\\phi K_{MC}}\\right)^q}\n$$\n\nA more convenient form for analysis is obtained by dividing the numerator and denominator by the $W_O$ term:\n$$\nP_{open} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{W_C}{W_O}} = \\frac{1}{1 + L_0 \\frac{\\left(1 + A/K_C\\right)^n \\left(1 + M/K_{MC}\\right)^q}{\\left(1 + A/(c K_C)\\right)^n \\left(1 + M/(\\phi K_{MC})\\right)^q}}\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\nP_{open}(A, M; L_0, c, \\phi) = \\left[1 + L_0 \\left(\\frac{1 + A/K_C}{1 + A/(c K_C)}\\right)^n \\left(\\frac{1 + M/K_{MC}}{1 + M/(\\phi K_{MC})}\\right)^q\\right]^{-1}\n$$\nThis is the final expression used for the numerical fitting.\n\n**2. Parameter Estimation via Nonlinear Least Squares Regression**\n\nThe task is to estimate the parameters $\\theta = (L_0, c, \\phi)$ for each dataset. Each dataset provides measured open probabilities at several agonist concentrations $A_j$ under two conditions: without modulator ($M=0$) and with a fixed modulator concentration ($M0$). This requires a joint fit to both data series simultaneously.\n\nThe method of least squares is employed to find the parameter values that minimize the sum of squared residuals (SSR) between the model's predictions and the experimental data. The SSR is defined as:\n$$\n\\text{SSR}(\\theta) = \\sum_{j} \\left( P_{open}(A_j, 0; \\theta) - P_{open, j}^{\\text{data}, M=0} \\right)^2 + \\sum_{j} \\left( P_{open}(A_j, M_{const}; \\theta) - P_{open, j}^{\\text{data}, M0} \\right)^2\n$$\nwhere the sum is over all agonist concentration points $j$ in the dataset.\n\nThe optimization is performed using `scipy.optimize.least_squares` from the SciPy library. This function is designed to solve nonlinear least-squares problems and is well-suited for this task. It operates on a vector of residuals, not the SSR itself. The residual vector, $r(\\theta)$, is constructed by concatenating the residuals from both experimental conditions:\n$$\nr(\\theta) = \\begin{bmatrix}\nP_{open}(A_1, 0; \\theta) - P_{open, 1}^{\\text{data}, M=0} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nP_{open}(A_N, 0; \\theta) - P_{open, N}^{\\text{data}, M=0} \\\\\nP_{open}(A_1, M_{const}; \\theta) - P_{open, 1}^{\\text{data}, M0} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nP_{open}(A_N, M_{const}; \\theta) - P_{open, N}^{\\text{data}, M0}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of agonist concentration points.\n\nThe `least_squares` function iteratively adjusts the parameters $\\theta$ to minimize the sum of the squares of the elements in this vector, $\\sum r_i^2$. For robustness, bounds are placed on the parameters to ensure they remain in a physically meaningful range (i.e., $L_0  0$, $c  0$, and $\\phi  0$). A lower bound of a small positive number (e.g., $10^{-9}$) is used to prevent division by zero and maintain physical relevance. An initial guess for the parameters is also required to start the iterative minimization process.\n\n**3. Implementation**\n\nThe solution is implemented in Python. A function `mwc_model` is defined to calculate $P_{open}$ based on the derived equation. A second function, `residuals`, computes the residual vector for a given set of parameters. This function is passed to `scipy.optimize.least_squares`. The main script iterates through the three provided datasets, performs the fit for each one, collects the estimated parameters, formats them to five decimal places, and prints the final result in the specified list-of-lists format. The exact fractional data provided is converted to floating-point numbers for numerical computation.

This computational exercise delves into the kinetics of recovery from desensitization using a powerful state-based modeling approach. You will construct a continuous-time Markov model and use its mathematical properties to connect the microscopic rates of transition between desensitized states to the macroscopic, experimentally observable time course of recovery [@problem_id:2812334].", "problem": "You are tasked with building a principled computational model for recovery from desensitization in ligand-gated ion channels (LGIC) using a paired-pulse protocol. The fundamental base you must use is first-order mass-action kinetics for state occupancy probabilities under a continuous-time Markov process and the consequence that such linear systems evolve under a matrix exponential, yielding sums of exponentials governed by the eigenvalues of the transition-rate matrix. The biological interpretation to use is: after the first saturating pulse, channels predominantly occupy desensitized states; during the interpulse interval with no ligand, channels undergo first-order transitions that either keep them within the desensitized manifold or return them to the closed (available) manifold. The amplitude of the second pulse (for a saturating stimulus) is proportional to the fraction of channels that have returned to the available manifold by the end of the interpulse interval. Your program must translate this into a mathematically sound calculation to extract exponential components from the desensitized-manifold dynamics and map each time constant to an underlying transition mode.\n\nDefinitions and modeling assumptions to use:\n- Let $n$ denote the number of desensitized states. Let $\\mathbf{p}_D(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ be the vector of occupation probabilities of the desensitized states at time $t$ during the interpulse interval (no agonist present), with initial condition $\\mathbf{p}_D(0)$ determined by the first pulse, satisfying $\\sum_{i=1}^n p_{D,i}(0) = 1$ and no occupation outside the desensitized manifold at $t=0$ for simplicity.\n- Let $k_{iC} \\ge 0$ be the first-order exit rate constant from desensitized state $i$ to the closed (available) manifold. Let $k_{ij} \\ge 0$ ($i \\ne j$) be the interconversion rate constant from desensitized state $i$ to desensitized state $j$.\n- The desensitized-manifold dynamics between pulses follow $d\\mathbf{p}_D/dt = \\mathbf{M}\\,\\mathbf{p}_D$, where $\\mathbf{M}$ is the $n \\times n$ rate matrix with diagonal entries $M_{ii} = -\\left(k_{iC} + \\sum_{j \\ne i} k_{ij}\\right)$ and off-diagonal entries $M_{ij} = k_{ji}$ for $i \\ne j$.\n- The fraction that remains desensitized at time $t$ is $S(t) = \\mathbf{1}^\\top \\mathbf{p}_D(t)$, where $\\mathbf{1}$ is the $n$-vector of ones. The paired-pulse amplitude ratio at an interpulse interval $\\Delta t$ (second pulse over first pulse) under saturating pulses is $R(\\Delta t) = 1 - S(\\Delta t)$.\n\nTasks your program must perform for each provided test case:\n1.
