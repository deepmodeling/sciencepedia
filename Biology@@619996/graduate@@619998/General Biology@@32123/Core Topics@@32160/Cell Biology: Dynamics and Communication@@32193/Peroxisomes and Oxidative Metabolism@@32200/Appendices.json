Assume the following foundational facts and constraints, each of which is widely accepted:\n- Activation of a free fatty acid to an acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) by acyl-CoA synthetase in the peroxisome hydrolyzes one adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) plus pyrophosphate, which is counted as an energetic cost of $2$ ATP equivalents.\n- Peroxisomal $\\beta$-oxidation shortens an acyl chain by $2$ carbons per cycle and produces $1$ acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), $1$ reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide ($\\mathrm{FADH_2}$), and $1$ reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) per cycle. In peroxisomes, $\\mathrm{FADH_2}$ transfers electrons directly to molecular oxygen to form hydrogen peroxide and does not contribute to oxidative phosphorylation. Peroxisomal NADH is reoxidized via redox shuttles with no net ATP production.\n- The C16:0 acyl chain and the peroxisomally generated acetyl groups are exported to mitochondria on carnitine as acylcarnitine and acetylcarnitine, respectively, and reconverted to their coenzyme A (CoA) esters in the mitochondrial matrix.

Therefore, the ATP yield is $0$.\n- The peroxisomal NADH is reoxidized via shuttle mechanisms that result in no net ATP production.\nThe $5$ molecules of acetyl-CoA are exported to the mitochondria for further oxidation.\nTherefore, the net ATP production from the peroxisomal $\\beta$-oxidation stage is $0$.\n$$ \\text{ATP from peroxisomal oxidation} = (5 \\times 0) + (5 \\times 0) = 0\\ \\text{ATP} $$\n\n**Step 3: Mitochondrial $\\beta$-Oxidation**\nThe C16:0-CoA molecule is transported into the mitochondrial matrix and undergoes complete $\\beta$-oxidation.
