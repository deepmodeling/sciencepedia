{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) serves as the primary entry point for proteins entering the secretory pathway. The decision to enter the ER and the final topology of membrane-spanning proteins are not random; they are dictated by specific signals within the nascent polypeptide's amino acid sequence. This practice [@problem_id:2795690] challenges you to act as a molecular detective, using foundational principles like the \"positive-inside\" rule and signal peptide characteristics to predict the ultimate subcellular location and orientation of several hypothetical proteins.", "problem": "A cell biologist is evaluating four nascent polypeptides, each characterized by a putative hydrophobic segment and the distribution of positively charged residues (Lysine/Arginine) flanking that segment. The goal is to predict which polypeptides will be cotranslationally targeted to the rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) via Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) and, for those that insert into the ER membrane, to predict their final topology. Use foundational facts that (i) SRP binds emerging hydrophobic signal sequences on ribosomes to direct cotranslational targeting to the ER, (ii) sufficiently long and hydrophobic segments often function as signal peptides or signal-anchor transmembrane domains, (iii) cleavage by the ER signal peptidase requires an accessible cleavage site with small residues at positions $-1$ and $-3$ relative to the scissile bond, and (iv) charge asymmetry across a hydrophobic segment biases topology such that the side with more positive charge tends to remain cytosolic (the “positive-inside” rule). Assume a typical transmembrane span has length approximately $18$–$25$ residues with an average hydropathy index $\\bar{H}$ sufficiently positive to partition into the lipid bilayer.\n\nThe four polypeptides are described as follows (from the N-terminus to the C-terminus):\n\n- Polypeptide P1: An N-terminal hydrophobic segment of length $22$ residues with average hydropathy $\\bar{H} = +2.1$, preceded by an N-region containing $+2$ net positive charge, followed immediately by a segment that includes a canonical signal peptidase motif with small residues at positions $-1$ and $-3$ (for example, Ala–X–Ala). Downstream of this region, there are no additional hydrophobic stretches longer than $10$ residues with $\\bar{H} > +1.0$.\n- Polypeptide P2: The first $34$ residues are moderately polar and include $+4$ net positive charge. Beginning at residue $35$ there is a hydrophobic segment of length $20$ residues with $\\bar{H} = +2.3$ and no credible signal peptidase motif near its C-terminal end. The $20$ residues immediately following this hydrophobic segment contain $+1$ net positive charge and are otherwise polar.\n- Polypeptide P3: Residues $5$–$25$ form a hydrophobic segment of length $21$ residues with $\\bar{H} = +2.2$ and no credible signal peptidase motif near its C-terminal end. Residues $1$–$4$ carry $+0$ net positive charge, whereas residues $26$–$45$ carry $+4$ net positive charge.\n- Polypeptide P4: Contains a hydrophobic stretch of length $12$ residues with $\\bar{H} = +0.7$ embedded within otherwise polar sequence. There is no signal peptidase motif and no clear clustering of positive charges on either side of this stretch (both flanks have $+0$ to $+1$ net positive charge).\n\nWhich option best classifies SRP recognition and the final topology for each polypeptide? Use the following topology terms: “soluble in ER lumen” (no transmembrane span after signal peptide cleavage), “type II” (single-pass with N-terminus in cytosol, C-terminus in ER lumen), and “type III” (single-pass with N-terminus in ER lumen, C-terminus in cytosol).\n\nA. P1 is recognized by SRP, its signal peptide is cleaved, and it becomes soluble in the ER lumen; P2 is recognized by SRP and becomes type II; P3 is recognized by SRP and becomes type III; P4 is not recognized by SRP and remains cytosolic.\n\nB. P1 is recognized by SRP and becomes type I (single-pass with N-terminus in ER lumen, C-terminus in cytosol) despite lacking any additional stop-transfer segment; P2 is recognized and becomes type III; P3 is recognized and becomes type II; P4 is recognized by SRP because any hydrophobic stretch suffices.\n\nC. P1 is recognized by SRP, its signal peptide is cleaved, and it becomes soluble in the ER lumen; P2 is recognized by SRP and becomes type III; P3 is recognized by SRP and becomes type II; P4 is not recognized by SRP and remains cytosolic.\n\nD. P1 is recognized by SRP but is not cleaved and thus becomes type I; P2 and P3 are recognized by SRP and both become type II regardless of charge distribution; P4 is not recognized by SRP and remains cytosolic.", "solution": "The fate of each polypeptide is determined by applying the given biophysical and biochemical rules.\n\n**Analysis of Polypeptide P1:**\n1.  **SRP Recognition**: The N-terminal segment has a length of $22$ residues and a high average hydropathy, $\\bar{H} = +2.1$. These characteristics are archetypal for a signal sequence that is recognized by the SRP. Thus, $P1$ will be targeted to the ER translocon.\n2.  **Translocation and Fate**: The presence of a canonical signal peptidase motif immediately following the hydrophobic segment indicates that it is a cleavable signal peptide. Upon translocation, this N-terminal signal sequence will be inserted into the translocon, threading the N-terminus into the ER lumen. The signal peptidase, an ER-lumenal enzyme, will cleave the polypeptide at this motif. The problem states there are no additional significant hydrophobic segments downstream. Therefore, after cleavage, the remainder of the polypeptide will be fully translocated into the ER lumen, becoming a soluble protein within that compartment.\n3.  **Conclusion for P1**: Recognized by SRP, signal peptide is cleaved, and the mature protein is soluble in the ER lumen.\n\n**Analysis of Polypeptide P2:**\n1.  **SRP Recognition**: This polypeptide possesses an internal hydrophobic segment of length $20$ residues with $\\bar{H} = +2.3$. This is sufficient for SRP recognition and to function as a signal-anchor sequence.\n2.  **Topology Determination**: The segment lacks a signal peptidase motif and will therefore permanently anchor the protein in the membrane. Its orientation is determined by the \"positive-inside\" rule. The N-terminal flank (residues $1$–$34$) has a net charge of $+4$. The C-terminal flank has a net charge of $+1$. Since the charge on the N-terminal side is significantly more positive ($+4 > +1$), this flank will be retained in the cytosol. Consequently, the N-terminus remains in the cytosol while the C-terminus is translocated into the ER lumen. This defines a **Type II** membrane protein.\n3.  **Conclusion for P2**: Recognized by SRP and integrated as a Type II transmembrane protein.\n\n**Analysis of Polypeptide P3:**\n1.  **SRP Recognition**: The polypeptide contains a hydrophobic segment (residues $5$–$25$) of length $21$ with $\\bar{H} = +2.2$. This qualifies as a signal-anchor sequence for SRP recognition and membrane insertion.\n2.  **Topology Determination**: Lacking a cleavage site, this segment will serve as a permanent transmembrane domain. We apply the \"positive-inside\" rule. The N-terminal flank (residues $1$–$4$) has a net charge of $+0$. The C-terminal flank (residues $26$–$45$) has a net charge of $+4$. The C-terminal side is overwhelmingly more positive ($+4 > +0$), so it will be retained in the cytosol. This orientation results in the N-terminus being translocated into the ER lumen and the C-terminus remaining in the cytosol. This defines a **Type III** membrane protein.\n3.  **Conclusion for P3**: Recognized by SRP and integrated as a Type III transmembrane protein.\n\n**Analysis of Polypeptide P4:**\n1.  **SRP Recognition**: The hydrophobic stretch is only $12$ residues long, which is substantially shorter than the typical $18$–$25$ residues required for stable membrane insertion and robust SRP binding. Furthermore, its average hydropathy, $\\bar{H} = +0.7$, is marginal. These characteristics make it a poor substrate for SRP.\n2.  **Fate**: It is highly improbable that SRP will efficiently recognize this polypeptide. Translation will complete on a free ribosome, and the resulting protein will remain in the cytosol.\n3.  **Conclusion for P4**: Not recognized by SRP and remains a cytosolic protein.\n\n**Evaluation of Provided Options**\n\n- **Option A**: This option states: P1 becomes soluble in the ER lumen; P2 becomes type II; P3 becomes type III; P4 remains cytosolic. This sequence of outcomes is in perfect agreement with the step-by-step derivation above. Each prediction is correct based on the established principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **Option B**: This option claims P1 becomes type I. This is incorrect. A type I protein possesses a C-terminal transmembrane domain in addition to a cleaved N-terminal signal sequence; P1 lacks this. The option then incorrectly identifies P2 as type III and P3 as type II, reversing the correct topologies dictated by the \"positive-inside\" rule. Finally, it incorrectly claims P4 is recognized by SRP, contradicting the known requirements for SRP substrate recognition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **Option C**: This option correctly identifies the fates of P1 and P4. However, it incorrectly assigns P2 as type III and P3 as type II. This demonstrates a failure to correctly apply the \"positive-inside\" rule to the charge distributions provided for these two polypeptides.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **Option D**: This option incorrectly claims P1 is not cleaved, despite the presence of a canonical peptidase motif. It also incorrectly asserts that P2 and P3 both become type II \"regardless of charge distribution,\" a statement that directly violates the fundamental rule of topology determination.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on rigorous application of the stated principles, only option A accurately describes the fate of all four polypeptides.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2795690"}, {"introduction": "After entering the rough ER, many proteins, particularly glycoproteins, must pass a stringent quality control inspection to ensure they have folded correctly. The calnexin cycle represents a key mechanism where the cell provides folding assistance and retains misfolded clients for further attempts. This exercise [@problem_id:2795661] invites you to build a kinetic model of this process, using the principles of competing first-order reactions to calculate the expected number of folding attempts a protein undergoes before it is deemed mature and ready for export.", "problem": "In the rough endoplasmic reticulum, the calnexin cycle enforces glycoprotein quality control by transiently binding monoglucosylated N-glycans on nascent polypeptides, assisting folding, and releasing them after glucose removal. Consider a single slow-folding glycoprotein that repeatedly enters this cycle until it exits the endoplasmic reticulum. Use the following foundational base: first-order kinetics for elementary steps with exponentially distributed waiting times, independence of competing Poisson processes, and the rule that a protein that has achieved its native state is not reglucosylated by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT).\n\nModel the cycle as follows.\n- While bound to calnexin, the last glucose is removed by endoplasmic reticulum glucosidase II with rate constant $k_{g}$, which terminates the current binding event.\n- While bound, the client folds toward the native state with rate constant $k_{f}$.\n- If the client is released while still non-native, UGGT adds back a glucose with rate constant $k_{u}$, leading to immediate rebinding to calnexin and initiation of a new binding cycle. If the client is native at release, UGGT does not act and the protein exits the endoplasmic reticulum.\n- Assume folding in the unbound state is negligible on the time scale set by UGGT for this slow-folding substrate, so that non-native clients are effectively always reglucosylated and re-enter the cycle.\n- All rate processes are independent and memoryless with constant rates.\n\nUsing these assumptions and the provided rate constants $k_{g} = 0.10\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{f} = 0.010\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and $k_{u} = 0.20\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, compute the expected number of calnexin binding cycles the glycoprotein undergoes before endoplasmic reticulum exit. Report your answer as a pure number (dimensionless), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the expected number of binding cycles a glycoprotein undergoes before it successfully folds and exits the ER. This can be modeled as a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial corresponds to one binding cycle.\n\nA binding cycle begins when the glycoprotein binds to calnexin. While bound, two independent, competing first-order processes occur:\n1.  **Folding:** The protein transitions from a non-native to a native state. This is a Poisson process with rate constant $k_{f}$.\n2.  **Release:** The terminal glucose is cleaved, and the protein is released from calnexin. This is a Poisson process with rate constant $k_{g}$.\n\nA \"successful\" cycle is one in which the protein folds into its native state *before* it is released from calnexin. If the protein folds first, its state becomes \"bound and native\". Subsequently, the release event (which must occur with rate $k_{g}$) will transition it to an \"unbound and native\" state. According to the problem statement, a native protein is not a substrate for UGGT and exits the ER. Thus, folding before release guarantees exit from the cycle.\n\nThe probability of success in a single trial, which we denote as $p$, is the probability that the folding event occurs before the release event. For two independent competing Poisson processes with rates $k_{f}$ and $k_{g}$, the probability that the event with rate $k_{f}$ occurs first is given by:\n$$p = \\frac{k_{f}}{k_{f} + k_{g}}$$\n\nAn \"unsuccessful\" cycle occurs if the protein is released from calnexin *before* it has folded. The probability of this event is $1 - p$. In this case, the protein is in an \"unbound and non-native\" state. The problem states that such proteins are recognized by UGGT, reglucosylated, and re-enter the binding cycle. The assumption that folding is negligible in the unbound state and that non-native clients are always recycled means that an unsuccessful cycle inevitably leads to a new binding trial.\n\nThe process continues until the first successful cycle occurs. The number of trials, $N$, required to achieve the first success in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials follows a geometric distribution with success probability $p$. The expected value of a geometrically distributed random variable $N$ (where $N$ counts the number of trials) is:\n$$E[N] = \\frac{1}{p}$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $p$, we find the expected number of cycles:\n$$E[N] = \\frac{k_{f} + k_{g}}{k_{f}} = 1 + \\frac{k_{g}}{k_{f}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values for the rate constants:\n$k_{f} = 0.010\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{g} = 0.10\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nThe expected number of cycles is:\n$$E[N] = 1 + \\frac{0.10}{0.010} = 1 + 10 = 11$$\n\nThe rate constant for reglucosylation, $k_{u} = 0.20\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, is not needed for this calculation, as it only affects the duration of the unbound phase between unsuccessful cycles, not the probability of success within a cycle or the total number of cycles.\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
