The null hypothesis, $H_0$, is that the sample is euploid. Under this hypothesis, the number of reads aligning to chromosome $21$, which we denote as the random variable $X$, follows a binomial distribution.

The analysis hinges on fundamental principles of meiosis, nondisjunction, and genetic recombination.\n\nFirst, we must determine the parental origin of the extra chromosome $21$ and the allelic composition of the two maternally-derived chromosomes in the child. The child has three copies of each locus. For each locus, one allele comes from the father and two from the mother.\n\nLet's analyze the child's genotype at each locus:\n- Locus M$1$: Child has alleles $198$ ($2$ copies) and $204$ ($1$ copy). The father's genotype is $204/212$. Therefore, the paternal contribution is allele $204$. The maternal contribution must be two copies of allele $198$. The mother's genotype is $198/206$. The child has inherited two copies of the same maternal allele ($198$). This situation is defined as **isodisomy**.\n\n- Locus M$2$: Child has alleles $186$ ($2$ copies) and $188$ ($1$ copy). The father's genotype is $188/196$. The paternal contribution is allele $188$. The maternal contribution is two copies of allele $186$. The mother's genotype is $180/186$. Similar to locus M$1$, the child has inherited two copies of the same maternal allele ($186$). This is also **isodisomy**.\n\n- Locus M$3$: Child has alleles $210$ ($1$ copy), $214$ ($1$ copy), and $218$ ($1$ copy). The father's genotype is $218/222$. The paternal contribution is allele $218$. The maternal contribution must be alleles $210$ and $214$. The mother's genotype is $210/214$. The child has inherited both of the mother's different alleles. This situation is defined as **heterodisomy**.\n\n- Locus M$4$: Child has alleles $192$ ($1$ copy), $200$ ($1$ copy), and $196$ ($1$ copy). The father's genotype is $196/204$. The paternal contribution is allele $196$. The maternal contribution is alleles $192$ and $200$. The mother's genotype is $192/200$. This is **heterodisomy**.\n\n- Locus M$5$: Child has alleles $176$ ($1$ copy), $184$ ($1$ copy), and $188$ ($1$ copy). The father's genotype is $188/196$. The paternal contribution is allele $188$. The maternal contribution is alleles $176$ and $184$. The mother's genotype is $176/184$. This is **heterodisomy**.\n\nSummary of maternal inheritance pattern from centromere-proximal to telomere-distal:\n- M$1$: Isodisomy\n- M$2$: Isodisomy\n- M$3$: Heterodisomy\n- M$4$: Heterodisomy\n- M$5$: Heterodisomy\n\nNow, let's apply the provided principles:\n1.  **Nondisjunction at meiosis I (MI)** results in the two homologous chromosomes failing to separate. The resulting gamete receives both homologs, leading to heterodisomy for all heterozygous loci along the entire chromosome, including those near the centromere.\n2.  **Nondisjunction at meiosis II (MII)** results in the two sister chromatids failing to separate. The resulting gamete receives two copies of the same replicated chromosome. If no crossover has occurred between the centromere and a given locus, the sister chromatids are identical at that locus, leading to isodisomy. Thus, MII nondisjunction is characterized by isodisomy at the centromere.\n\nThe observation of isodisomy at the centromere-proximal locus M$1$ is strong evidence against an MI error and points towards an **MII nondisjunction event**.\n\nThe problem also states that a switch from an isodisomic segment to a heterodisomic segment indicates a crossover event. In our data, there is a clear switch between locus M$2$ (isodisomic) and locus M$3$ (heterodisomic). This implies that a single crossover event occurred between these two loci during maternal meiosis I.\n\nLet's reconstruct the meiotic event:\n- **Meiosis I**: The mother's homologous chromosomes $21$ pair and undergo recombination. Based on the pattern observed in the child, we can deduce a single crossover occurred between loci M$2$ and M$3$. Meiosis I anaphase proceeds correctly, so the secondary oocyte receives one replicated chromosome, which is now composed of two non-identical sister chromatids due to the crossover.\n- **Meiosis II**: In the secondary oocyte, the sister chromatids fail to separate (nondisjunction). Both chromatids are passed on to the ootid, which upon fertilization results in the trisomic child.\n\nLet's trace the alleles based on this model. The two sister chromatids that failed to separate in MII must be identical from the centromere to the point of crossover (resulting in isodisomy) and different distal to the crossover (resulting in heterodisomy).\n- Region of isodisomy (M$1$, M$2$): The maternal alleles in the child are $198$ and $186$. So, the segment of the chromatids proximal to the crossover carried alleles M$1=198$ and M$2=186$.\n- Region of heterodisomy (M$3$, M$4$, M$5$): The maternal alleles are M$3=(210, 214)$, M$4=(192, 200)$, and M$5=(176, 184)$.\nThis means one chromatid had alleles ($210, 192, 176$) and the other had ($214, 200, 184$) in this region.\nThe resulting two chromatids that were passed to the child were:\n- Chromatid $1$: M$1=198$, M$2=186$, M$3=210$, M$4=192$, M$5=176$\n- Chromatid $2$: M$1=198$, M$2=186$, M$3=214$, M$4=200$, M$5=184$\nThis scenario is perfectly consistent with a MII nondisjunction event preceded by a single crossover between loci M$2$ and M$3$ in MI.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n\n**A. Meiosis I maternal nondisjunction with no crossovers on chromosome 21.**\nThis would result in heterodisomy at all heterozygous maternal loci, including M$1$ and M$2$. The data shows clear isodisomy at M$1$ and M$2$. Therefore, this interpretation is incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Meiosis II maternal nondisjunction with a single crossover between M2 and M3.**\nThis model predicts isodisomy from the centromere to the crossover point (i.e., at M$1$ and M$2$) and heterodisomy distal to the crossover point (i.e., at M$3$, M$4$, and M$5$). This precisely matches the observed data pattern.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Meiosis I maternal nondisjunction with a single crossover between M3 and M4.**\nThis is incorrect primarily because the nondisjunction event is MI. As established, the isodisomy at M$1$ and M$2$ contradicts an MI error.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Meiosis II maternal nondisjunction with two crossovers, one between M1–M2 and one between M4–M5.**\nThis model involves MII nondisjunction, which is consistent with isodisomy near the centromere. However, the pattern of crossovers is inconsistent with the data. Two crossovers would create alternating segments of isodisomy and heterodisomy. A crossover between M$1$ and M$2$ would make M$1$ isodisomic and M$2$ heterodisomic. A second crossover between M$4$ and M$5$ would make M$5$ isodisomic again. The expected pattern would be Isodisomy(M$1$) $\\rightarrow$ Heterodisomy(M$2$, M$3$, M$4$) $\\rightarrow$ Isodisomy(M$5$). The observed pattern is Isodisomy(M$1$, M$2$) $\\rightarrow$ Heterodisomy(M$3$, M$4$, M$5$). This option is inconsistent with the observed allelic pattern and is less parsimonious than a single crossover event.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nThe most plausible and parsimonious explanation consistent with all provided data is a maternal nondisjunction at meiosis II, with a single crossover having occurred during the preceding meiosis I between loci M$2$ and M$3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2807166"}, {"introduction": "While most cases of Down syndrome result from random nondisjunction, a significant minority arise from inherited structural variations, such as a Robertsonian translocation.
