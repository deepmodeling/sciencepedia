It is a well-posed problem in population genetics, grounded in established principles of Mendelian inheritance and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium applied to sex chromosomes. All necessary information is provided, and the premises are internally consistent and scientifically sound.\n\nLet the wild-type allele at the X-linked locus be denoted by $A$ and the recessive disease allele by $a$. The corresponding chromosomes are $X^A$ and $X^a$.\nThe frequency of the $X^A$ allele in the population's X chromosome pool is given as $p$.\nThe frequency of the $X^a$ allele in the population's X chromosome pool is given as $q$.\nIt is stated that $p + q = 1$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the population is at equilibrium, which means the allele frequencies on the X chromosomes are the same for both males and females. That is, the frequency of the $X^a$ allele is $q$ in the male population and also $q$ in the female population.\n\nFirst, we determine the incidence of the disease in males.\nMales have an $XY$ genotype. They possess only one X chromosome, which is inherited from their mother. This state is known as hemizygosity. The possible genotypes for males with respect to this locus are $X^A Y$ and $X^a Y$.\nA male will be affected by the disease if he possesses the disease allele, $a$. His genotype must be $X^a Y$.\nThe frequency of the $X^a Y$ genotype in the male population is equal to the frequency of the $X^a$ allele in the gene pool from which they inherit their X chromosome. At equilibrium, this frequency is $q$.\nGiven the assumption of complete penetrance, the incidence of the disease in males, denoted by $I_m$, is equal to the frequency of the affected genotype.\n$$I_m = q$$\n\nNext, we determine the incidence of the disease in females.\nFemales have an $XX$ genotype. They inherit one X chromosome from their mother and one from their father. The inheritance of these alleles is assumed to be independent, following the principle of random mating. The possible genotypes for females are $X^A X^A$, $X^A X^a$, and $X^a X^a$.\nThe frequencies of these genotypes are determined by the allele frequencies in the parental gametes. Under the equilibrium assumption, the frequency of $X^a$ in both the sperm (from fathers) and egg (from mothers) pools is $q$.\nThe frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype, $X^a X^a$, is the product of the probabilities of inheriting an $X^a$ allele from the father and an $X^a$ allele from the mother.\n$$\\text{Frequency}(X^a X^a) = q \\times q = q^2$$\nThe problem states that the disease allele is recessive in females. Therefore, a female will only express the disease phenotype if she is homozygous recessive, i.e., her genotype is $X^a X^a$.\nWith complete penetrance, the incidence of the disease in females, denoted by $I_f$, is equal to the frequency of the $X^a X^a$ genotype.\n$$I_f = q^2$$\n\nFinally, we derive the male-to-female incidence ratio.\nThis ratio is given by $\\frac{I_m}{I_f}$.\nSubstituting the expressions we derived for $I_m$ and $I_f$:\n$$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{I_m}{I_f} = \\frac{q}{q^2}$$\nFor the incidence to be non-zero and the ratio to be well-defined, we assume that the disease allele exists in the population, i.e., $q > 0$. Under this condition, the expression can be simplified.\n$$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{1}{q}$$\nThis expression represents the male-to-female incidence ratio of an X-linked recessive trait at equilibrium in a population under the specified assumptions.

It is a valid problem. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe derivation of the recurrence relations for the allele frequencies in males and females depends on the rules of X-linked inheritance in an XY system.\n\nFirst, consider the males in generation $t+1$. A male receives his Y chromosome from his father and his single X chromosome from his mother. Therefore, the genetic composition of the X chromosomes in the male population of a given generation is a direct reflection of the genetic composition of the X chromosomes passed down from the female population of the preceding generation. The frequency of allele $A$ among the X chromosomes carried by males in generation $t+1$, denoted $p_m(t+1)$, must be equal to the frequency of allele $A$ among the X chromosomes carried by females in generation $t$, which is given as $p_f(t)$.\n\nMathematically, this relationship is expressed as:\n$$p_m(t+1) = p_f(t)$$\n\nNext, consider the females in generation $t+1$. A female is diploid for the X chromosome, inheriting one X chromosome from her mother and one X chromosome from her father. The problem assumes random mating, which implies a random union of gametes.\n\nThe pool of X-bearing gametes produced by the females of generation $t$ has an allele frequency of $A$ equal to $p_f(t)$.\nThe pool of X-bearing gametes produced by the males of generation $t$ has an allele frequency of $A$ equal to $p_m(t)$. This is because males have genotype $X^A Y$ with frequency $p_m(t)$ and $X^a Y$ with frequency $1-p_m(t)$, and all of their daughters receive their single X chromosome.\n\nA female in generation $t+1$ is formed by the fusion of one gamete from each of these two pools. Therefore, the frequency of allele $A$ among the X chromosomes of females in generation $t+1$, denoted $p_f(t+1)$, is the arithmetic mean of the allele frequencies in the parental gamete pools from which they are derived. One half of their X chromosomes comes from the paternal pool (with frequency $p_m(t)$ for allele $A$) and the other half comes from the maternal pool (with frequency $p_f(t)$ for allele $A$).\n\nMathematically, this relationship is expressed as:\n$$p_f(t+1) = \\frac{1}{2} p_m(t) + \\frac{1}{2} p_f(t)$$\n\nCombining these two results gives the complete recurrence mapping that transforms the state vector of allele frequencies from generation $t$ to generation $t+1$. The mapping for the pair $\\big(p_m(t), p_f(t)\\big)$ is:\n$$ (p_m(t+1), p_f(t+1)) = \\left( p_f(t), \\frac{1}{2} p_m(t) + \\frac{1}{2} p_f(t) \\right) $$\n\nThis constitutes the required derivation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\np_f(t) & \\frac{1}{2} p_m(t) + \\frac{1}{2} p_f(t)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2836812"}]}
