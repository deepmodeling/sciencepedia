Alleles $I^{A}$ and $I^{B}$ are codominant to one another and each is dominant to $i$. Expression of ABO antigens on red blood cells requires a functional fucosyltransferase encoded by the $H$ locus; individuals with genotype $hh$ at the $H$ locus do not synthesize the required substrate (the Bombay phenotype) and therefore present no ABO antigen on red blood cells regardless of the ABO genotype, yielding phenotype $O$. Assume the $ABO$ and $H$ loci are on different chromosomes and assort independently.\n\nTwo genotyped parents mate: one is $I^{A}i$ and the other is $I^{B}i$ at the ABO locus. The $H$-locus genotypes of the parents are unknown, but the population allele frequency of the null allele $h$ is $f \\in (0,1)$, and the $H$ locus is at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium with allele frequencies $1-f$ for $H$ and $f$ for $h$.\n\nUsing Punnett squares, Mendel’s law of segregation, and independent assortment, derive from first principles the offspring distribution over ABO genotypes for the cross $I^{A}i \\times I^{B}i$, then incorporate the epistatic $H$ locus to obtain the offspring phenotype probabilities for $AB$, $A$, $B$, and $O$ in terms of $f$. Reconcile how all four phenotypes can arise from this cross by explicit reasoning about the role of $hh$.\n\nWhat is the expected fraction of offspring that will be phenotypically $AB$ as a function of $f$?

By Mendel’s law of segregation, each parent transmits one allele at random from its pair.\n\n- At the $H$ locus, genotype $hh$ is epistatic to $ABO$ and produces no ABO antigen on red blood cells; thus any $ABO$ genotype paired with $hh$ yields phenotype $O$. A child is phenotypically non-$O$ only if it carries at least one $H$ allele. The loci $ABO$ and $H$ assort independently.\n\n- Under Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium at the $H$ locus with allele frequencies $1-f$ for $H$ and $f$ for $h$, random mating implies that offspring have $H$-locus genotype frequencies $(1-f)^{2}$ for $HH$, $2f(1-f)$ for $Hh$, and $f^{2}$ for $hh$.\n\nStep $1$: Derive the $ABO$-genotype distribution for the cross $I^{A}i \\times I^{B}i$.\n\nConstruct the Punnett square for the $ABO$ locus. The first parent ($I^{A}i$) produces gametes $I^{A}$ and $i$ with probabilities $1/2$ and $1/2$; the second parent ($I^{B}i$) produces gametes $I^{B}$ and $i$ with probabilities $1/2$ and $1/2$.

We solve using the quadratic formula:\n$$p = \\frac{-(-53) \\pm \\sqrt{(-53)^2 - 4(60)(11)}}{2(60)} = \\frac{53 \\pm \\sqrt{2809 - 2640}}{120} = \\frac{53 \\pm \\sqrt{169}}{120} = \\frac{53 \\pm 13}{120}$$\nThis yields two potential solutions:\n$$p_1 = \\frac{53+13}{120} = \\frac{66}{120} = \\frac{11}{20} = 0.55$$\n$$p_2 = \\frac{53-13}{120} = \\frac{40}{120} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nWe must enforce the constraint $p \\le \\frac{1}{2}$. The solution $p_1 = 0.55$ is invalid. The only valid solution is $p_2 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe maximum-likelihood estimates are:\n$\\hat{p} = \\frac{1}{3}$\nSince $\\hat{p}=\\hat{q}$, we have $\\hat{q} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nFrom the constraint $\\hat{p}+\\hat{q}+\\hat{r}=1$, we find $\\hat{r} = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nThus, $\\hat{p} = \\hat{q} = \\hat{r} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nStep 3: Pearson Chi-Squared Goodness-of-Fit Statistic\n\nUsing the MLEs, we calculate the expected phenotype probabilities under the HWE model:\n- $E(\\pi_A) = \\hat{p}^2+2\\hat{p}\\hat{r} = (\\frac{1}{3})^2 + 2(\\frac{1}{3})(\\frac{1}{3}) = \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n- $E(\\pi_B) = \\hat{q}^2+2\\hat{q}\\hat{r} = (\\frac{1}{3})^2 + 2(\\frac{1}{3})(\\frac{1}{3}) = \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n- $E(\\pi_{AB}) = 2\\hat{p}\\hat{q} = 2(\\frac{1}{3})(\\frac{1}{3}) = \\frac{2}{9}$\n- $E(\\pi_O) = \\hat{r}^2 = (\\frac{1}{3})^2 = \\frac{1}{9}$\n\nNext, we calculate the expected counts ($E_i$) for each phenotype in a sample of $n=900$:\n- $E_A = n \\times E(\\pi_A) = 900 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 300$\n- $E_B = n \\times E(\\pi_B) = 900 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 300$\n- $E_{AB} = n \\times E(\\pi_{AB}) = 900 \\times \\frac{2}{9} = 200$\n- $E_O = n \\times E(\\pi_O) = 900 \\times \\frac{1}{9} = 100$\n\nThe observed counts ($O_i$) are $O_A=315$, $O_B=315$, $O_{AB}=180$, $O_O=90$.\nThe Pearson chi-squared statistic, $\\chi^2$, is computed as:\n$$\\chi^2 = \\sum_{i \\in \\{A,B,AB,O\\}} \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$$\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{(315 - 300)^2}{300} + \\frac{(315 - 300)^2}{300} + \\frac{(180 - 200)^2}{200} + \\frac{(90 - 100)^2}{100}$$\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{15^2}{300} + \\frac{15^2}{300} + \\frac{(-20)^2}{200} + \\frac{(-10)^2}{100}$$\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{225}{300} + \\frac{225}{300} + \\frac{400}{200} + \\frac{100}{100}$$\n$$\\chi^2 = 0.75 + 0.75 + 2 + 1 = 4.5$$\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value rounded to four significant figures.\nThe calculated value is $4.5$. Expressed with four significant figures, this is $4.500$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.500}$$", "id": "2772123"}]}
