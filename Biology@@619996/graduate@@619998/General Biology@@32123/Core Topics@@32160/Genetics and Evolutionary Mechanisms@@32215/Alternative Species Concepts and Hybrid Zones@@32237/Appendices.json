Assume the following biologically realistic model and decision rule.\n\n- Model assumptions:\n  - The two descendant lineages split exactly $T$ generations ago from a common ancestor and have since evolved in complete isolation (no migration) with constant effective population size $N_{e}$ in each descendant lineage.\n  - Each locus is neutral, non-recombining within itself, and unlinked to other loci; loci are therefore independent.\n  - At each of $L$ independent loci, you sample $n$ haploid gene copies from each lineage.\n  - Genealogies follow Kingman’s coalescent in continuous time.\n\n- Operational criterion for exclusive ancestry at a locus:\n  - A locus is said to exhibit exclusive ancestry (reciprocal monophyly) for the two lineages if, going backward in time, all $n$ sampled lineages within each descendant lineage have coalesced to a single lineage before time $T$.

It is scientifically grounded in standard population genetics models, specifically Kingman's coalescent theory. It is well-posed, with all variables, conditions, and objectives clearly defined. The terminology is precise and objective, allowing for a formal mathematical derivation. The problem constitutes a non-trivial application of established principles to a question of species delimitation.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first principles as requested.\n\nThe Type II error rate, denoted by $\\alpha$ in the problem statement, is the probability of failing to detect exclusive ancestry when the model of exclusive ancestry is true. The model states that two lineages diverged $T$ generations ago and have evolved in isolation since. The decision rule for detecting exclusive ancestry is that at least one of $L$ independent loci must exhibit reciprocal monophyly. Therefore, a failure to detect exclusive ancestry occurs if and only if **none** of the $L$ loci exhibit reciprocal monophyly.\n\nGiven that the $L$ loci are independent, the probability of this joint event is the product of the individual probabilities.\nLet $P_{RM}$ be the probability that a single, randomly chosen locus exhibits reciprocal monophyly.\nThe probability that a single locus does **not** exhibit reciprocal monophyly is $1 - P_{RM}$.\nThe Type II error rate $\\alpha$ is thus:\n$$ \\alpha = (1 - P_{RM})^L $$\n\nReciprocal monophyly at a locus is defined as the event where, within **each** of the two descendant lineages, the sample of $n$ haploid gene copies coalesces to a single ancestral lineage before the speciation time $T$.\nLet $P_{coal}$ be the probability that for a single lineage, the $n$ sampled gene copies coalesce to a single ancestor by time $T$.\nSince the two descendant lineages evolve independently post-split, the probability of reciprocal monophyly is the product of the probabilities of monophyly for each lineage:\n$$ P_{RM} = P_{coal} \\times P_{coal} = (P_{coal})^2 $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\alpha = (1 - (P_{coal})^2)^L $$\n\nThe core of the problem is to derive an expression for $P_{coal}$. This requires the application of Kingman's coalescent theory. We consider a single population of constant effective size $N_e$. Time in the standard coalescent model is measured in units of $N_e$ generations for a haploid model. The given time $T$ is in generations, so we convert it to coalescent time units, $t = T/N_e$.\n\nThe process of coalescence from $n$ lineages down to $1$ is a sequence of pairwise mergers. When there are $k$ active lineages, the waiting time until the next coalescence event (reducing the number of lineages to $k-1$) is an exponential random variable, $W_k$, with rate $\\lambda_k = \\binom{k}{2}$.\nThe total time for $n$ lineages to coalesce to their most recent common ancestor (MRCA) is the sum of these waiting times:\n$$ T_{n \\to 1} = \\sum_{k=2}^{n} W_k $$\nwhere $W_k \\sim \\text{Exponential}(\\lambda_k)$ and $\\lambda_k = \\binom{k}{2} = \\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$.\n$P_{coal}$ is the probability that this total time is less than the speciation time $t=T/N_e$.\n$$ P_{coal} = P(T_{n \\to 1} < t) $$\nThis is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of $T_{n \\to 1}$, which follows a hypoexponential distribution (a sum of independent exponential variables with distinct rates). The CDF is given by:\n$$ P(T_{n \\to 1} < t) = 1 - \\sum_{k=2}^{n} C_k \\exp(-\\lambda_k t) $$\nwhere the coefficients $C_k$ are derived from the partial fraction expansion of the Laplace transform of the probability density function of $T_{n \\to 1}$. The coefficient $C_k$ is given by:\n$$ C_k = \\prod_{\\substack{j=2 \\\\ j \\neq k}}^{n} \\frac{\\lambda_j}{\\lambda_j - \\lambda_k} $$\nSubstituting $\\lambda_j = \\frac{j(j-1)}{2}$:\n$$ C_k = \\prod_{\\substack{j=2 \\\\ j \\neq k}}^{n} \\frac{\\frac{j(j-1)}{2}}{\\frac{j(j-1)}{2} - \\frac{k(k-1)}{2}} = \\prod_{\\substack{j=2 \\\\ j \\neq k}}^{n} \\frac{j(j-1)}{j^2 - j - k^2 + k} = \\prod_{\\substack{j=2 \\\\ j \\neq k}}^{n} \\frac{j(j-1)}{(j-k)(j+k-1)} $$\nThis product can be evaluated to a closed-form expression. The sign of the denominator term $(j-k)$ is negative when $j<k$. There are $k-2$ such terms (for $j=2, \\dots, k-1$), contributing a factor of $(-1)^{k-2}$. A full combinatorial simplification yields:\n$$ C_k = (-1)^{k-2} (2k-1) \\frac{n!(n-1)!}{(n-k)!(n+k-1)!} $$\nThe probability that a single lineage is **not** monophyletic by time $t$ is $P(T_{n \\to 1} \\ge t) = 1 - P(T_{n \\to 1} < t)$. Let us denote this probability as $P_{not\\_mono}$.\n$$ P_{not\\_mono}(n, t) = \\sum_{k=2}^{n} C_k \\exp(-\\lambda_k t) = \\sum_{k=2}^{n} \\left( (-1)^{k-2} (2k-1) \\frac{n!(n-1)!}{(n-k)!(n+k-1)!} \\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k(k-1)}{2} t\\right) $$\nWe have $P_{coal} = 1 - P_{not\\_mono}(n, t)$.\nSubstituting back into the expression for $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\alpha = (1 - (1 - P_{not\\_mono})^2)^L = (1 - (1 - 2P_{not\\_mono} + P_{not\\_mono}^2))^L = (2P_{not\\_mono} - P_{not\\_mono}^2)^L $$\nFinally, we substitute the full expression for $P_{not\\_mono}$ with $t=T/N_e$. This yields the final closed-form analytical expression for the Type II error rate $\\alpha$ as a function of the given parameters. The expression clearly shows the dependence on sampling depth $n$ through the summation limits and coefficients, and on the number of loci $L$ as an exponent. As $P_{not\\_mono}$ is a probability between $0$ and $1$, the base term $(2P_{not\\_mono} - P_{not\\_mono}^2)$ is also between $0$ and $1$. Thus, increasing $L$ will decrease $\\alpha$. Increasing sampling depth $n$ generally decreases $P_{not\\_mono}$ (by increasing the rate of coalescence), which in turn decreases $\\alpha$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left( 2\\left(\\sum_{k=2}^{n} (-1)^{k-2} (2k-1) \\frac{n!(n-1)!}{(n-k)!(n+k-1)!} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k(k-1)T}{2N_e}\\right)\\right) - \\left(\\sum_{k=2}^{n} (-1)^{k-2} (2k-1) \\frac{n!(n-1)!}{(n-k)!(n+k-1)!} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k(k-1)T}{2N_e}\\right)\\right)^2 \\right)^L}$$", "id": "2775007"}, {"introduction": "While species are often defined by their separation, the true test of their integrity lies in the strength of reproductive barriers that resist gene flow.

The parameters are specified, the definitions are clear, and the assumptions (independence of loci, weak hazards) are explicitly stated, rendering the problem well-posed and objective. The provided numerical values for selection coefficients and recombination rates are biologically plausible. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of fundamental principles. The problem is valid.\n\nStep 3: Derivation and Solution.\nThe task is to find the effective migration rate, $m_{\\text{eff}}$, of a neutral marker that is initially in complete linkage disequilibrium with $k$ deleterious alleles. The effective migration rate is the baseline migration rate, $m$, multiplied by the probability that the neutral marker successfully introgresses, i.e., that it survives the indirect selection acting upon it through its linkage to the barrier loci.\n\nConsider a single barrier locus, $i$. The immigrant haplotype carrying the neutral marker is subject to two competing processes:\n1. Selective removal of the haplotype at a rate $s_i$ per generation.\n2. Disruption of the linkage between the neutral marker and the deleterious allele at locus $i$ via recombination, which occurs at a rate $r_i$ per generation.\n\nAssuming these are weak, continuous-time hazards, this is a classic competing risks problem. The total rate at which the linkage association between the marker and the deleterious allele at locus $i$ is resolved (either by removal of the haplotype or by recombination) is the sum of the individual rates, $s_i + r_i$. The probability that this resolution occurs via recombination—the event that allows the marker to \"escape\" selection from this locus—is the ratio of the recombination rate to the total rate of events.\n\nLet $P_{\\text{escape}, i}$ be the probability of escape from the selective drag of locus $i$.\n$$P_{\\text{escape}, i} = \\frac{r_i}{r_i + s_i}$$\nThis expression gives the probability that the neutral marker lineage recombines away from the deleterious allele before it is purged from the population by selection acting at locus $i$.\n\nThe problem states that selection and recombination act independently across the $k$ barrier loci. For the neutral marker to successfully introgress, it must escape the selective drag from all $k$ loci. The total probability of survival for the marker, $P_{\\text{survival}}$, is therefore the product of the individual escape probabilities for each locus.\n$$P_{\\text{survival}} = \\prod_{i=1}^{k} P_{\\text{escape}, i} = \\prod_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{r_i}{r_i + s_i}$$\n\nThe effective migration rate, $m_{\\text{eff}}$, is the product of the baseline migration rate, $m$, and the probability of survival.\n$$m_{\\text{eff}} = m \\cdot P_{\\text{survival}} = m \\prod_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{r_i}{r_i + s_i}$$\n\nWe are given the definition of the cumulative barrier strength, $B$, as $m_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{m}{1 + B}$. We can now equate the two expressions for $m_{\\text{eff}}$ to solve for $B$.\n$$\\frac{m}{1 + B} = m \\prod_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{r_i}{r_i + s_i}$$\nDividing both sides by $m$ (assuming $m \\neq 0$) gives:\n$$\\frac{1}{1 + B} = \\prod_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{r_i}{r_i + s_i}$$\nInverting both sides yields:\n$$1 + B = \\frac{1}{\\prod_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{r_i}{r_i + s_i}} = \\prod_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{r_i + s_i}{r_i}$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$1 + B = \\prod_{i=1}^{k} \\left(1 + \\frac{s_i}{r_i}\\right)$$\nFinally, the expression for the cumulative barrier strength $B$ is:\n$$B = \\left[ \\prod_{i=1}^{k} \\left(1 + \\frac{s_i}{r_i}\\right) \\right] - 1$$\nThis is the derived expression for $B$ from first principles.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $B$ using the provided parameters for $k=4$.\nThe ratios $\\frac{s_i}{r_i}$ for each of the $4$ loci are:\n- For locus $i=1$: $\\frac{s_1}{r_1} = \\frac{0.02}{0.02} = 1$\n- For locus $i=2$: $\\frac{s_2}{r_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.03} = 1$\n- For locus $i=3$: $\\frac{s_3}{r_3} = \\frac{0.02}{0.01} = 2$\n- For locus $i=4$: $\\frac{s_4}{r_4} = \\frac{0.01}{0.02} = 0.5$\n\nNext, we calculate the terms $\\left(1 + \\frac{s_i}{r_i}\\right)$:\n- Locus $1$: $1 + 1 = 2$\n- Locus $2$: $1 + 1 = 2$\n- Locus $3$: $1 + 2 = 3$\n- Locus $4$: $1 + 0.5 = 1.5$\n\nWe then compute the product:\n$$\\prod_{i=1}^{4} \\left(1 + \\frac{s_i}{r_i}\\right) = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 1.5 = 4 \\times 4.5 = 18$$\nThis product is equal to $1 + B$:\n$$1 + B = 18$$\nSolving for $B$:\n$$B = 18 - 1 = 17$$\nThe problem requires the answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$B = 17.00$$\nThis final result represents the cumulative strength of the barrier to introgression for the neutral marker, which reduces the effective migration rate by a factor of $1 + B = 18$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{17.00}$$", "id": "2775018"}, {"introduction": "The clean-branching tree is a useful idealization, but the history of life is often reticulated by ancient gene flow.

Given the outgroup $O$ is ancestral, the correct pattern is $(H_1, H_2, H_3)$ being $(\\text{A}, \\text{B}, \\text{B})$. This pattern arises when a unique mutation occurs on the branch of the gene tree that unites the lineages from $H_2$ and $H_3$ to the exclusion of the lineage from $H_1$. This requires the gene tree for these three taxa to have the topology $(H_1, (H_2, H_3))$.\n\nA site exhibits the BABA pattern if the allelic state across $(H_1, H_2, H_3)$ is $(\\text{B}, \\text{A}, \\text{B})$. This pattern arises when a unique mutation occurs on the branch of the gene tree that unites the lineages from $H_1$ and $H_3$ to the exclusion of the lineage from $H_2$. This requires the gene tree to have the topology $(H_2, (H_1, H_3))$.\n\nThe species tree topology is $((H_1, H_2), H_3)$. Under the null hypothesis of no post-divergence gene flow (introgression), the only mechanism that can generate gene trees discordant with the species tree is incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). ILS occurs when lineages fail to coalesce in their immediate ancestral population and instead coalesce further back in time in a more ancient common ancestor.\n\nLet us trace the lineages $h_1$, $h_2$, and $h_3$ from populations $H_1$, $H_2$, and $H_3$ back in time. According to the species tree, $h_1$ and $h_2$ lineages enter their common ancestral population $P_{12}$. If they coalesce within $P_{12}$, the resulting gene tree will be concordant with the species tree, $((H_1, H_2), H_3)$. This topology cannot produce either ABBA or BABA patterns.\n\nFor ABBA or BABA patterns to arise, $h_1$ and $h_2$ must fail to coalesce in $P_{12}$. Consequently, three distinct lineages—$h_1$, $h_2$, and the ancestral lineage of $H_3$, which is $h_3$—enter the ancestral population $P_{123}$. Under the neutral coalescent model, any pair of these three lineages is equally likely to coalesce first. There are three possible pairs: $(h_1, h_2)$, $(h_2, h_3)$, and $(h_1, h_3)$. The probability for each of these coalescent events is $1/3$.\n\n1.  Coalescence of $h_1$ and $h_2$: This occurs with probability $1/3$. The resulting gene tree is $((H_1,H_2),H_3)$, concordant with the species tree. No ABBA or BABA patterns are generated.\n2.  Coalescence of $h_2$ and $h_3$: This occurs with probability $1/3$. The resulting gene tree is $(H_1,(H_2,H_3))$. A mutation on the internal branch leading to the $(H_2, H_3)$ clade produces an ABBA site pattern.\n3.  Coalescence of $h_1$ and $h_3$: This occurs with probability $1/3$. The resulting gene tree is $(H_2,(H_1,H_3))$. A mutation on the internal branch leading to the $(H_1, H_3)$ clade produces a BABA site pattern.\n\nThe expected number of sites of a given pattern is proportional to the probability of the corresponding gene tree topology multiplied by the expected length of the internal branch on which the mutation must arise. Let $T_{23}$ be the length of the internal branch in the $(H_1, (H_2, H_3))$ gene tree, and $T_{13}$ be the length of the internal branch in the $(H_2, (H_1, H_3))$ gene tree. The number of ABBA sites, denoted $N_{\\mathrm{ABBA}}$, is proportional to $P((H_1, (H_2, H_3))) \\times \\mathbb{E}[T_{23}]$, and the number of BABA sites, $N_{\\mathrm{BABA}}$, is proportional to $P((H_2, (H_1, H_3))) \\times \\mathbb{E}[T_{13}]$.\n\nDue to the fundamental symmetry of the coalescent process within the ancestral population $P_{123}$ under the null hypothesis, the two discordant topologies are generated with equal probability: $P(h_2,h_3 \\text{ coalesce first}) = P(h_1,h_3 \\text{ coalesce first}) = 1/3$. Furthermore, the distribution of the waiting time until the final coalescence event (and thus the distribution of the internal branch lengths $T_{23}$ and $T_{13}$) is identical for both cases. Therefore, $\\mathbb{E}[T_{23}] = \\mathbb{E}[T_{13}]$.\n\nAs a result, under the null hypothesis of no gene flow, the expected number of ABBA sites is equal to the expected number of BABA sites:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[N_{\\mathrm{ABBA}}] = \\mathbb{E}[N_{\\mathrm{BABA}}] $$\nThe expected value of the numerator of the D-statistic is:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[N_{\\mathrm{ABBA}} - N_{\\mathrm{BABA}}] = \\mathbb{E}[N_{\\mathrm{ABBA}}] - \\mathbb{E}[N_{\\mathrm{BABA}}] = 0 $$\nWhile the D-statistic is a ratio of random variables, its expectation is typically approximated as the ratio of expectations, especially when the denominator is large.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[D] \\approx \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[N_{\\mathrm{ABBA}} - N_{\\mathrm{BABA}}]}{\\mathbb{E}[N_{\\mathrm{ABBA}} + N_{\\mathrm{BABA}}]} = \\frac{0}{\\mathbb{E}[N_{\\mathrm{ABBA}} + N_{\\mathrm{BABA}}]} = 0 $$\nThus, under the null hypothesis of only incomplete lineage sorting and no introgression, the expected value of the D-statistic is $0$.\n\nPart 2: Jackknife Variance Estimation\n\nWe are given site counts for $B=6$ genomic blocks. The task is to compute the jackknife estimate of the variance of $\\hat{D}$.\nThe estimator is $\\hat{D} = \\frac{\\sum_{b=1}^{B} x_b}{\\sum_{b=1}^{B} y_b}$, where $x_b = \\mathrm{ABBA}_b - \\mathrm{BABA}_b$ and $y_b = \\mathrm{ABBA}_b + \\mathrm{BABA}_b$.\n\nFirst, we compute $x_b$ and $y_b$ for each block $b \\in \\{1, \\dots, 6\\}$:\n- Block 1: $(\\mathrm{ABBA}_1, \\mathrm{BABA}_1) = (120, 100) \\implies x_1 = 120 - 100 = 20, y_1 = 120 + 100 = 220$\n- Block 2: $(\\mathrm{ABBA}_2, \\mathrm{BABA}_2) = (80, 90) \\implies x_2 = 80 - 90 = -10, y_2 = 80 + 90 = 170$\n- Block 3: $(\\mathrm{ABBA}_3, \\mathrm{BABA}_3) = (150, 140) \\implies x_3 = 150 - 140 = 10, y_3 = 150 + 140 = 290$\n- Block 4: $(\\mathrm{ABBA}_4, \\mathrm{BABA}_4) = (60, 70) \\implies x_4 = 60 - 70 = -10, y_4 = 60 + 70 = 130$\n- Block 5: $(\\mathrm{ABBA}_5, \\mathrm{BABA}_5) = (110, 100) \\implies x_5 = 110 - 100 = 10, y_5 = 110 + 100 = 210$\n- Block 6: $(\\mathrm{ABBA}_6, \\mathrm{BABA}_6) = (90, 95) \\implies x_6 = 90 - 95 = -5, y_6 = 90 + 95 = 185$\n\nNext, we calculate the total sums:\n$$ S_x = \\sum_{b=1}^{6} x_b = 20 - 10 + 10 - 10 + 10 - 5 = 15 $$\n$$ S_y = \\sum_{b=1}^{6} y_b = 220 + 170 + 290 + 130 + 210 + 185 = 1205 $$\n\nThe jackknife procedure requires calculating the estimate $\\hat{D}_{(i)}$ by removing one block at a time. The formula is $\\hat{D}_{(i)} = (S_x - x_i) / (S_y - y_i)$.\n- $\\hat{D}_{(1)} = \\frac{15 - 20}{1205 - 220} = \\frac{-5}{985} \\approx -0.00507614$\n- $\\hat{D}_{(2)} = \\frac{15 - (-10)}{1205 - 170} = \\frac{25}{1035} \\approx 0.02415459$\n- $\\hat{D}_{(3)} = \\frac{15 - 10}{1205 - 290} = \\frac{5}{915} \\approx 0.00546448$\n- $\\hat{D}_{(4)} = \\frac{15 - (-10)}{1205 - 130} = \\frac{25}{1075} \\approx 0.02325581$\n- $\\hat{D}_{(5)} = \\frac{15 - 10}{1205 - 210} = \\frac{5}{995} \\approx 0.00502513$\n- $\\hat{D}_{(6)} = \\frac{15 - (-5)}{1205 - 185} = \\frac{20}{1020} \\approx 0.01960784$\n\nNow, we compute the mean of the jackknife replicates, $\\bar{D}_{\\mathrm{jack}}$:\n$$ \\bar{D}_{\\mathrm{jack}} = \\frac{1}{B} \\sum_{i=1}^{B} \\hat{D}_{(i)} = \\frac{1}{6}(-0.00507614 + 0.02415459 + 0.00546448 + 0.02325581 + 0.00502513 + 0.01960784) $$\n$$ \\bar{D}_{\\mathrm{jack}} = \\frac{1}{6}(0.07243171) \\approx 0.01207195 $$\n\nThe jackknife estimate of the variance is given by the formula:\n$$ \\mathrm{var}_{\\mathrm{jack}}(\\hat{D}) = \\frac{B-1}{B} \\sum_{i=1}^{B} (\\hat{D}_{(i)} - \\bar{D}_{\\mathrm{jack}})^2 $$\nWe compute the squared differences:\n- $(\\hat{D}_{(1)} - \\bar{D}_{\\mathrm{jack}})^2 \\approx (-0.00507614 - 0.01207195)^2 = (-0.01714809)^2 \\approx 0.0002940576$\n- $(\\hat{D}_{(2)} - \\bar{D}_{\\mathrm{jack}})^2 \\approx (0.02415459 - 0.01207195)^2 = (0.01208264)^2 \\approx 0.0001459902$\n- $(\\hat{D}_{(3)} - \\bar{D}_{\\mathrm{jack}})^2 \\approx (0.00546448 - 0.01207195)^2 = (-0.00660747)^2 \\approx 0.0000436587$\n- $(\\hat{D}_{(4)} - \\bar{D}_{\\mathrm{jack}})^2 \\approx (0.02325581 - 0.01207195)^2 = (0.01118386)^2 \\approx 0.0001250800$\n- $(\\hat{D}_{(5)} - \\bar{D}_{\\mathrm{jack}})^2 \\approx (0.00502513 - 0.01207195)^2 = (-0.00704682)^2 \\approx 0.0000496578$\n- $(\\hat{D}_{(6)} - \\bar{D}_{\\mathrm{jack}})^2 \\approx (0.01960784 - 0.01207195)^2 = (0.00753589)^2 \\approx 0.0000567897$\n\nThe sum of squared differences is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{6} (\\hat{D}_{(i)} - \\bar{D}_{\\mathrm{jack}})^2 \\approx 0.0002940576 + 0.0001459902 + 0.0000436587 + 0.0001250800 + 0.0000496578 + 0.0000567897 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{6} (\\hat{D}_{(i)} - \\bar{D}_{\\mathrm{jack}})^2 \\approx 0.000715234 $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the variance with the pre-factor $\\frac{B-1}{B} = \\frac{5}{6}$:\n$$ \\mathrm{var}_{\\mathrm{jack}}(\\hat{D}) = \\frac{5}{6} \\times 0.000715234 \\approx 0.000596028 $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.0005960$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.0005960}\n$$", "id": "2775031"}]}
