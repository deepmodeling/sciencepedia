Task: Derive genotype and phenotype frequencies, then compute the frequency of the $AB$ phenotype for the given frequencies.\n\nValidation Verdict:\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard application of the Hardy-Weinberg principle to a multi-allelic locus, a fundamental topic in population genetics. The givens are complete, consistent, and scientifically realistic. The problem violates no validation criteria and is therefore deemed **valid**. We may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe assumptions provided—a large, randomly mating population with no evolutionarily relevant forces acting upon it—are the conditions for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. For a locus with multiple alleles, the principle states that both allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. The equilibrium genotype frequencies can be predicted from the allele frequencies.\n\nUnder the assumption of random mating, the formation of diploid genotypes can be modeled as the random union of gametes from a common gene pool. The frequencies of gametes carrying alleles $A$, $B$, and $O$ are given by their respective population frequencies, $p_A$, $p_B$, and $p_O$.\n\nTo find the expected genotype frequencies, we consider the product of the allele frequencies in the gamete pool, which is equivalent to the expansion of the multinomial $(p_A + p_B + p_O)^2$.\nThe six possible genotypes and their expected frequencies are:\n1.  Homozygous for allele $A$ (genotype $AA$): The probability of a gamete carrying $A$ uniting with another gamete carrying $A$ is $p_A \\times p_A$. Thus, $f(AA) = p_A^2$.\n2.  Homozygous for allele $B$ (genotype $BB$): By the same logic, $f(BB) = p_B^2$.\n3.  Homozygous for allele $O$ (genotype $OO$): Similarly, $f(OO) = p_O^2$.\n4.  Heterozygous with alleles $A$ and $B$ (genotype $AB$): This can be formed in two ways: an $A$ sperm fertilizing a $B$ egg (frequency $p_A p_B$), or a $B$ sperm fertilizing an $A$ egg (frequency $p_B p_A$). The total frequency is the sum: $f(AB) = p_A p_B + p_B p_A = 2 p_A p_B$.\n5.  Heterozygous with alleles $A$ and $O$ (genotype $AO$): Formed from an $A$ gamete and an $O$ gamete. The total frequency is $f(AO) = 2 p_A p_O$.\n6.  Heterozygous with alleles $B$ and $O$ (genotype $BO$): Formed from a $B$ gamete and an $O$ gamete. The total frequency is $f(BO) = 2 p_B p_O$.\n\nThe sum of these genotype frequencies is $p_A^2 + p_B^2 + p_O^2 + 2p_A p_B + 2p_A p_O + 2p_B p_O = (p_A + p_B + p_O)^2 = 1^2 = 1$, as expected.\n\nNext, we derive the phenotype frequencies by mapping the genotypes to phenotypes based on the given dominance relationships.\n- Alleles $A$ and $B$ are codominant.\n- Alleles $A$ and $B$ are both completely dominant to allele $O$.\n\n1.  **Blood Type A**: Individuals with this phenotype have at least one $A$ allele and no $B$ allele. The possible genotypes are $AA$ and $AO$.\n    The expected frequency of phenotype A is the sum of the frequencies of these genotypes:\n    $f(\\text{Type A}) = f(AA) + f(AO) = p_A^2 + 2 p_A p_O$.\n\n2.  **Blood Type B**: Individuals with this phenotype have at least one $B$ allele and no $A$ allele.

The locus also determines a quantitative pigment intensity trait. The trait exhibits incomplete dominance at the organismal level, but the usual $F_2$ categorical scoring by three classes (dark, intermediate, light) yields an apparent $1:2:1$ ratio that does not reveal which allele is partially dominant because the intermediate class is phenotypically distinct and collapses all heterozygotes.\n\nYou perform the following crosses and measurements, using large sample sizes so that sample means equal their expectations:\n- Parental line $A_1A_1$ has mean pigment intensity $30$ (arbitrary units).\n- Parental line $A_2A_2$ has mean pigment intensity $60$.\n- A single confirmed $A_1A_2$ heterozygote (verified by the codominant enzyme phenotype) is backcrossed to each parental homozygote, yielding two backcross families.

The dominance coefficient is then defined as $h = d/a$.

There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific or mathematical principles. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Construction of the allelic series for visible phenotype.\nThe dominance hierarchy is given as $A^{1} \\succ A^{2} \\succ A^{3} \\succ A^{4}$. The phenotype of a heterozygote is determined by the more dominant allele. Let $[A^{i}]$ denote the phenotype corresponding to allele $A^{i}$. The possible unordered heterozygote genotypes are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$. Their phenotypes are determined as follows:\n- Genotype $A^{1}A^{2}$: Since $A^{1} \\succ A^{2}$, the phenotype is $[A^{1}]$.\n- Genotype $A^{1}A^{3}$: Since $A^{1} \\succ A^{3}$, the phenotype is $[A^{1}]$.\n- Genotype $A^{1}A^{4}$: Since $A^{1} \\succ A^{4}$, the phenotype is $[A^{1}]$.\n- Genotype $A^{2}A^{3}$: Since $A^{2} \\succ A^{3}$, the phenotype is $[A^{2}]$.\n- Genotype $A^{2}A^{4}$: Since $A^{2} \\succ A^{4}$, the phenotype is $[A^{2}]$.\n- Genotype $A^{3}A^{4}$: Since $A^{3} \\succ A^{4}$, the phenotype is $[A^{3}]$.\n\nPart 2: Computation of the required fraction.\nWe must find the fraction of the population that satisfies two conditions simultaneously:\n1. The visible phenotype is $[A^{2}]$.\n2. The molecular activity is strictly greater than $T=0.50$.\n\nFirst, we identify all genotypes that produce the visible phenotype $[A^{2}]$. According to the dominance hierarchy $A^{1} \\succ A^{2} \\succ A^{3} \\succ A^{4}$, an individual expresses the $[A^{2}]$ phenotype if and only if the most dominant allele they carry is $A^{2}$. The genotypes meeting this criterion are the homozygote $A^{2}A^{2}$ and the heterozygotes $A^{2}A^{3}$ and $A^{2}A^{4}$.\n\nNext, for each of these three genotypes, we must calculate the molecular activity and determine if it exceeds the threshold $T=0.50$. The activity for a genotype $A^{i}A^{j}$ is $V_{ij} = (v_{i} + v_{j})/2$. The given per-allele activities are $v_{1}=1.0$, $v_{2}=0.7$, $v_{3}=0.4$, and $v_{4}=0.05$.\n- For genotype $A^{2}A^{2}$: The activity is $V_{22} = (v_{2} + v_{2})/2 = v_{2} = 0.7$. Since $0.7 > 0.50$, this genotype satisfies the second condition.\n- For genotype $A^{2}A^{3}$: The activity is $V_{23} = (v_{2} + v_{3})/2 = (0.7 + 0.4)/2 = 1.1/2 = 0.55$. Since $0.55 > 0.50$, this genotype also satisfies the second condition.\n- For genotype $A^{2}A^{4}$: The activity is $V_{24} = (v_{2} + v_{4})/2 = (0.7 + 0.05)/2 = 0.75/2 = 0.375$. Since $0.375 \\le 0.50$, this genotype does not satisfy the second condition.\n\nThus, the individuals who satisfy both required conditions are those with genotypes $A^{2}A^{2}$ and $A^{2}A^{3}$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the expected frequencies of these two genotypes under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The frequency of a homozygous genotype $A^{i}A^{i}$ is $p_{i}^{2}$, and the frequency of a heterozygous genotype $A^{i}A^{j}$ is $2p_{i}p_{j}$. The given allele frequencies are $p_{2}=0.35$ and $p_{3}=0.30$.\n- The frequency of genotype $A^{2}A^{2}$ is $P(A^{2}A^{2}) = p_{2}^{2} = (0.35)^{2} = 0.1225$.\n- The frequency of genotype $A^{2}A^{3}$ is $P(A^{2}A^{3}) = 2p_{2}p_{3} = 2(0.35)(0.30) = 2(0.105) = 0.2100$.\n\nThe total fraction of the population satisfying both conditions is the sum of the frequencies of these two genotypes:\n$$F = P(A^{2}A^{2}) + P(A^{2}A^{3})$$\n$$F = 0.1225 + 0.2100 = 0.3325$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
