Here, we are concerned with the component of selection arising from mating success. The absolute fitness component is the number of mates, $m$. Relative mating success is thus $w_m = m / \\bar{m}$.\nThe mating success component of the selection differential on trait $z$, denoted $S_m$, is therefore:\n$$ S_m = \\mathrm{Cov}(z, w_m) = \\mathrm{Cov}\\left(z, \\frac{m}{\\bar{m}}\\right) $$\nUsing the property of covariance, $\\mathrm{Cov}(X, aY) = a \\mathrm{Cov}(X, Y)$, where $a$ is a constant, we have:\n$$ S_m = \\frac{1}{\\bar{m}}\\mathrm{Cov}(z, m) $$\nTo bound this quantity, we employ the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for covariances, which states that for any two random variables $X$ and $Y$:\n$$ |\\mathrm{Cov}(X, Y)| \\leq \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(X) \\mathrm{Var}(Y)} $$\nApplying this inequality to our expression for $S_m$:\n$$ |S_m| = \\left| \\frac{1}{\\bar{m}} \\mathrm{Cov}(z, m) \\right| = \\frac{1}{\\bar{m}} |\\mathrm{Cov}(z, m)| \\leq \\frac{1}{\\bar{m}} \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(z) \\mathrm{Var}(m)} $$\nNote that $\\bar{m} > 0$. Now we introduce the opportunity for sexual selection, $I_s = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(m)}{\\bar{m}^2}$. We can rearrange this to express $\\mathrm{Var}(m)$ as $\\mathrm{Var}(m) = I_s \\bar{m}^2$. Substituting this into our inequality:\n$$ |S_m| \\leq \\frac{1}{\\bar{m}} \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(z) (I_s \\bar{m}^2)} = \\frac{1}{\\bar{m}} \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(z)} \\sqrt{I_s} \\sqrt{\\bar{m}^2} $$\nSince $\\bar{m} > 0$, $\\sqrt{\\bar{m}^2} = \\bar{m}$. The terms $\\bar{m}$ cancel out:\n$$ |S_m| \\leq \\sqrt{I_s \\mathrm{Var}(z)} $$\nThis is the general inequality that provides an upper bound on the magnitude of the selection differential component attributable to mating success.\n\n**Task 3: Evaluation of the Bound for a Standardized Trait**\n\nA standardized trait $z$ is one that has been scaled to have a mean of $0$ and a variance of $1$. Thus, for a standardized trait, we have $\\mathrm{Var}(z)=1$.\nSubstituting $\\mathrm{Var}(z)=1$ into our derived inequality gives the tightest upper bound, $B$:\n$$ |S_m| \\leq \\sqrt{I_s \\times 1} = \\sqrt{I_s} $$\nSo, the maximum absolute value of the mating success selection differential on a standardized trait is $B = \\sqrt{I_s}$.
